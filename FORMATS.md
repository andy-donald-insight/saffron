# Saffron 3 - Formats
===================

This document describes the formats used and generated by Saffron 3. <br/>All formats are in JSON
and we will describe the properties each files has, with a link to an example (as found in the [examples](https://gitlab.insight-centre.org/saffron/saffron/blob/saffron_development/examples/) folder)

## Input formats

### Corpus  ([corpus_with_authors.json](https://gitlab.insight-centre.org/saffron/saffron/blob/issue215/examples/corpus_with_authors.json))
------

This file contains the description of the corpus, including all the metadata. It is a collection of documents, each element being a different dicument with its own metadata and link to the file containing the text. A corpus has the following properties:

* `documents`: A list of documents in the corpus

    Each element of the list should have *at least* one of the following four:

    * `file`: A string referring to the original version of this document on disk (absolute or relative path)
    * `id`: A unique string to identify the document
    * `url`: The URL of the file
    * `contents`: The text contents of the file
    
    In addition the following may be provided:
    * `name`: The human readable name of the document
    * `mime_type`: The MIME type of the document
    * `authors`: An array of authors of this document
            
        For each author of the document, provide:
        - Either the name of the author as a string
        - Or if more details on the author:
            * `name`: The author's name (required)
            * `id`: A unique string to identify the author (optional)
            * `name_variants`: An array of strings given other known variants of the name (optional)
            
    * `metadata`: An object containing any other properties
        Each property is in the form: 
        
            "property name":"property value", separated by commas


### Config ([config.json](https://gitlab.insight-centre.org/saffron/saffron/blob/saffron_development/examples/config.json))

This input file for the command line interface (generated automatically if using the user interface) describes all options from the different steps of Saffron.
See the [wiki](https://gitlab.insight-centre.org/saffron/saffron/wikis/saffron-approach) for the details on what each property is for and the scientific explaination of the method.

It contains each of the Saffron steps:

##### 1.   Term Extraction
Configuration for the options of the term extraction phase. All properties are included under the object:

* `termExtraction`: Which element contains the following properties to define:
    * `threshold` : Sets a minimum Saffron score for the terms retrieved

    * `maxTerms` : Sets the maximum number of terms retrieved 
    
    * `ngramMin` : Sets the minimum number of words that can make up a term
    
    * `ngramMax` : Sets the maximum number of words that can make up a term
    
    * `minTermFreq` : Sets the number of times a term must appear in the dataset to be retrieved
    
    * `maxDocs` : A limit on the number of documents that can be contained in the corpus (default to 2147483647)
    
    * `method` : Choose between two ranking procedures: "voting" (algorithm that integrates multiple score functions) and "single" (only one score function)
    
    * `features` : List of scoring functions if choosing the "Voting" method above, or will be ignored the "Single" method was chosen (by default set to [ "comboBasic", "weirdness", "totalTfIdf", "cValue", "residualIdf" ])
    
        Options are:  "comboBasic", "weirdness", "totalTfIdf", "cValue", "residualIdf", "avgTermFreq", "basic", "novelTopicModel", "postRankDC", "relevance"
                    
    * `corpus` : Path to the model that contains XYZ (by default set to ${saffron.home}/models/wiki-terms.json.gz)
    
    * `baseFeature` : Choose the scoring function to use (if method set to "Single"), or the feature which will get more weight in the final score (if method set to "Voting"). Choose between "comboBasic"
    
    * `numThreads` : 0
    
    * `posModel` : "${saffron.home}/models/en-pos-maxent.bin"
    
    * `tokenizerModel` : null
    
    * `lemmatizerModel` : "${saffron.home}/models/en-lemmatizer.dict.txt"
    
    * `stopWords` : null
    
    * `preceedingTokens` : [ "NN", "JJ", "NNP", "NNS" ]
    
    * `middleTokens` : [ "IN" ]
    
    * `headTokens` : [ "NN", "CD", "NNS" ]
    
    * `headTokenFinal` : true
    
    * `blacklist` : [ ]
    
    * `blacklistFile` : null
    
    * `oneTopicPerDoc` : false


##### 2.   Author - Term linking

* `authorTerm`: The phase of linking between authors and terms (if authors are present in the metadata, ignored otherwise)

##### 3.   Author Similarity

* `authorSim`: The phase of connecting authors together (if authors are present in the metadata, ignored otherwise)

##### 4.   Term Similarity

* `termSim`: The phase of connecting similar terms

##### 5.   Taxnomy Construction

* `taxonomy`: The phase of creation of the taxonomy

Domain Model
------------

The set of keywords that define a domain. This object has only one property
