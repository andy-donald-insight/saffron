* `documents`: A list of documents in the corpus

    Each element of the list should have *at least* one of the following four:

    * `file`: A string referring to the original version of this document on disk (absolute or relative path)
    * `id`: A unique string to identify the document
    * `url`: The URL of the file
    * `contents`: The text contents of the file
    
    In addition the following may be provided:
    * `name`: The human readable name of the document
    * `mime_type`: The MIME type of the document
    * `authors`: An array of authors of this document
            
        For each author of the document, provide:
        - Either the name of the author as a string
        - Or if more details on the author:
            * `name`: The author's name (required)
            * `id`: A unique string to identify the author (optional)
            * `name_variants`: An array of strings given other known variants of the name (optional)
            
    * `metadata`: An object containing any other properties
        Each property is in the form: 
        
            "property name":"property value", separated by commas
