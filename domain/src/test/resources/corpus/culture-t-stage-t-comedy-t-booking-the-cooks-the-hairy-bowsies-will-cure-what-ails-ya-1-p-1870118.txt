	They can go and stick them up their arse
	Forget Michelin squire, if you want a spare tyre
	Try a coddle an a few bleedin jars

	Coddle, a rasher-and-sausage stew beloved of Dubs since time immemorial. Such is the devotion that The Hairy Bowsies have to this humble local dish, theyve written a song about it. If you are not already familiar with this comedy duos outstanding musical repertoire and fervent nationalist beliefs, then you should make a date to see them at the upcoming Vodafone Comedy Festival.

	Set amongst the picturesque, grassy knolls of Dublins Iveagh Gardens, this is a place that the lads reckon should be used for other activities when its not filled with festivals. I believe it is an Irishmans right and duty to lug a crate of cider out to any of the former British pleasure gardens and reclaim what is rightfully ours.

	We should point out that it is great to see that The Hairy Bowsies will be back on stage again soon. For they were so depressed when their ballad Spit on the Brits didnt get accepted to represent Ireland in the Eurovision, it didnt look they could ever face the public again. But as band member Scribbler ODonohoe explains, while the song itself was very popular with the people, it was prohibited as a condition in the Good Friday Agreement. They took one for the team. Bowsies and Gents.

	And while they still have an impassioned hatred against our former rulers, it wouldnt be fair to say that they are equally vitriolic about its people. For instance, when they speak of their favourite Irish food dish, coddle, they refer to it as, the Oliver Reed of the food world. To add greater depth to that statement, vocalist Ding Dong Denny OReilly also told me: We would be a lot better off in Dublin today if we got rid of all this modern microwave rubbish and best-before dates  a coddle was best before it got cold and best after 25 pints.

	Just make sure you dont put any carrots into your coddle for, as The Hairy Bowsies would advise, anything orange doesnt belong in a truly Irish dish.

	INGREDIENTS
	8oz rashers
	1lb Irish pork sausages
	1 cup chicken stock
	6 medium potatoes, peeled and cut into thick slices
	2 medium onions, peeled and sliced
	2 tablespoons of freshly chopped parsley

	METHOD
	Cut the rashers into strips. Bring the stock up to the boil in a medium saucepan. Drop in the sausages and the bacon and let them simmer for five minutes so that they can cook and flavour the stock.&nbsp;Remove the sausages and bacon with a slotted spoon and keep the liquid. Cut each sausage into four or five chunks. Lash in the spuds, onions, sausages and bacon into the pot.

	Cover and simmer gently for about an hour. Add the parsley and some black pepper and serve in a bowl.

	The Vodafone Comedy Festival takes place in Dublins Iveagh Gardens, Dublin, from July 24th-27th
