      If you are indeed, lucky enough to pin down the frantic Jason Byrne for an interview, there truly is no way of knowing what he may come out with next. Then again, when youre a globally touring comic, there can be as much insanity from the punters as there is from the stage. As Jason outlined in one incident, Here in Melbourne, a fella brought in a bag with two spiders and a snake in it, he was sitting in the audience and said he was a vet, people were terrified. 
      It was actually in Australia that he kicked off his, You Name The Show campaign, where his fans had to name the new show, not him. This unique approach brought back some great results which he was more than willing to share on his brilliant social media posts. But his own personal favourites were, The picture of a knob drawn on the poster,The Ginger Ballinteer Minge Brigade and YOU name the show. 
      And when hes not waxing lyrical about the antics of his fanbase, hes quite happy to get back to telling us about his own somewhat unusual idiosyncrasies and indeed, those of his family. When I asked him about what kinds of special food traditions they have at his house, he had this to say, Every Easter, we all go to my mums house to taste her famous Chocolate Easter Jesus pie. She makes it in the shape of Jesus on the cross and there are smarties in his head. 
      Between outrageous audience members and semi blasphemous holiday cakes, its no wonder that Jason craves one piece of edible familiarity when hes off the road. His wifes amazing Vegetarian Chilli. At least thats one element in his life that comfortably lacks any big surprises. Heres how she does it.
