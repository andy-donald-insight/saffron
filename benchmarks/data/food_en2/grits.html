<p><b>Grits</b> is a food made by boiling ground <a href="/Maize" title="Maize">maize</a> (also known as corn), and usually served with other flavorings as a breakfast dish, usually savory. It is popular in the <a href="/Southern_United_States" title="Southern United States">Southern United States</a>.</p>
<p>Grits is of <a href="/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas" title="Indigenous peoples of the Americas">Native American</a> origin, and is similar to other thick maize-based <a href="/Porridge" title="Porridge">porridges</a> from around the world such as <a href="/Polenta" title="Polenta">polenta</a>.</p>
<p>Modern grits are commonly made of alkali-treated corn known as <i><a href="/Hominy" title="Hominy">hominy</a></i>, in which case it may be called &#34;hominy grits&#34;. &#34;Instant grits&#34; and &#34;quick grits&#34; use hominy processed for faster cooking, widely sold in supermarkets.</p>
<p>The word &#34;grits&#34; may be treated as either singular or plural; historically, in the American South it was always singular. It derives from the Old English word &#34;<a href="/Grit_(grain)" title="Grit (grain)">grytt</a>,&#34; meaning coarse meal.&#60;ref&#62;{{Citation |last=Harper |first=Douglas |url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=grits" rel="nofollow">http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=grits</a> |accessdate=August 27, 2011 |title=Online Etymology Dictionary: grits}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>

<p>Grits have their origin in Native American corn preparation. Traditionally, the hominy for grits was ground on a stone <a href="/Mill_(grinding)" title="Mill (grinding)">mill</a>. The ground hominy is then passed through screens, the finer sifted material used as grit meal, and the coarser as grits. Many American communities used a <a href="/Gristmill" title="Gristmill">gristmill</a> until the mid-twentieth century, farmers bringing their corn to be ground, and the <a href="/Miller" title="Miller">miller</a> keeping a portion as his fee. State law in <a href="/South_Carolina" title="South Carolina">South Carolina</a> requires grits and corn meal to be enriched, similar to the requirement for flour, unless the grits are made from the corn a miller kept as his fee.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.scstatehouse.net/CODE/t39c029.htm" rel="nofollow">South Carolina Code of Laws, Title 39 – Trade and Commerce, Chapter 29</a>, retrieved Dec 14, 2007&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>Three-quarters of grits sold in the U.S. are bought in the South, in an area stretching from Texas to <a href="/Virginia" title="Virginia">Virginia</a> that is sometimes called the &#34;grits belt&#34;.&#60;ref&#62;

<p>In the South Carolina <a href="/Lowcountry" title="Lowcountry">Lowcountry</a>, the uncooked ground corn is known as &#34;grist&#34;, and the cooked dish is &#34;hominy&#34;. This is distinct from the usual use of the term <a href="/Hominy" title="Hominy">hominy</a>.</p>
<p>Grits are either yellow or white, depending on the color of corn. The most common version in supermarkets is &#34;quick&#34; grits, which have the germ and hull removed. Whole kernel grits are sometimes called &#34;Speckled&#34;.</p>

<p>
Whole kernel grits are prepared by adding five or six parts boiling water (seasoned with salt - 1/4 tsp for each cup of water) to one part grits and cooking for 20 to 45 minutes. Grits expand when cooked and need periodic stirring to prevent sticking, and lumps from  forming. They are not done until they have absorbed four times their volume of water. {{citation needed|date=August 2015}} The additional water allows for some evaporation as they cook. Whole grain grits require much longer to become soft than do &#34;quick grits.&#34; Grits are most typically served seasoned with salt and pepper, as well as generous amounts of butter. On occasion they are served with grated cheese, sausage, bacon, or <a href="/Red-eye_gravy" title="Red-eye gravy">red-eye gravy</a>. Grits may also be seasoned with butter and sugar, and a small amount of salt, giving them a salty-sweet flavor similar to kettle corn.</p>
<p>Extra, i.e. left-over, grits can be put into a glass tumbler, chilled until needed, sliced into slabs with a taut string, and fried, either plain or with a <a href="/Breading" title="Breading">breading</a>. In this form they are denominated &#34;fried grits&#34; (&#34;fried hominy&#34; in the <a href="/Lowcountry" title="Lowcountry">Lowcountry</a>).</p>
