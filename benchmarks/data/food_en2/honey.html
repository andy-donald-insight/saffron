&#60;!-- Definition --&#62;
<b>Honey</b> {{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|ʌ|n|i}} is a sweet <a href="/Food" title="Food">food</a> made by bees using <a href="/Nectar_(plant)" title="Nectar (plant)">nectar</a> from flowers. The variety produced by <a href="/Honey_bee" title="Honey bee">honey bees</a> (the <a href="/Genus" title="Genus">genus</a> <i>Apis</i>) is the one most commonly referred to, as it is the type of honey collected by most <a href="/Beekeeper" title="Beekeeper">beekeepers</a> and consumed by people.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Collection">Collection</span></h2>
<p>Honey is collected from wild bee colonies, or from domesticated <a href="/Beehive" title="Beehive">beehives</a>.  Wild bee nests are sometimes located by following a <a href="/Honeyguide" title="Honeyguide">honeyguide</a> bird.  The bees may first be pacified by using smoke from a <a href="/Bee_smoker" title="Bee smoker">bee smoker</a>.  The smoke triggers a feeding instinct (an attempt to save the resources of the hive from a possible fire), making them less aggressive and the smoke obscures the pheromones the bees use to communicate.</p>
<p>The <a href="/Honeycomb" title="Honeycomb">honeycomb</a> is removed from the hive and the honey may be extracted from that, either by crushing or by using a <a href="/Honey_extractor" title="Honey extractor">honey extractor</a>. The honey is then usually filtered to remove beeswax and other debris.</p>
<p>Before the invention of removable frames, bee colonies were often sacrificed in order to conduct the harvest.  The harvester would take all the available honey and replace the entire colony the next spring.  Since the invention of removable frames, the principles of husbandry lead most beekeepers to ensure that their bees will have enough stores to survive the winter, either by leaving some honey in the beehive or by providing the colony with a honey substitute such as sugar water or crystalline sugar (often in the form of a &#34;candyboard&#34;).  The amount of food necessary to survive the winter depends on the variety of bees and on the length and severity of local winters.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Fermentation">Fermentation</span></h3>
<p>Honey is the main ingredient in the alcoholic beverage <a href="/Mead" title="Mead">mead</a>, which is also known as &#34;honey wine&#34; or &#34;honey beer&#34;. Historically, the ferment for mead was honey&#39;s naturally occurring yeast. Honey is also used as an <a href="/Adjuncts" title="Adjuncts">adjunct</a> in some <a href="/Beer" title="Beer">beers</a>.</p>
<p>Honey wine, or mead, is typically (modern era) made with a honey and water mixture with yeast added for fermentation. Primary fermentation usually takes 40 days, after which the <a href="/Must" title="Must">must</a> needs to be racked into a secondary fermentation vessel and left to sit about 35–40 more days. If done properly, fermentation will be finished by this point (though if a sparkling mead is desired, fermentation can be restarted after bottling by the addition of a small amount of sugar), but most meads require aging for 6–9 months or more in order to be palatable.</p>

<p>
The physical properties of honey vary, depending on water content, the type of flora used to produce it (pasturage), temperature, and the proportion of the specific sugars it contains. Fresh honey is a <a href="/Supersaturation" title="Supersaturation">supersaturated</a> liquid, containing more sugar than the water can typically dissolve at ambient temperatures. At room temperature, honey is a <a href="/Supercooling" title="Supercooling">supercooled</a> liquid, in which the <a href="/Glucose" title="Glucose">glucose</a> will precipitate into solid granules. This forms a semisolid solution of <a href="/Precipitation_(chemistry)" title="Precipitation (chemistry)">precipitated</a> glucose <a href="/Crystal" title="Crystal">crystals</a> in a solution of <a href="/Fructose" title="Fructose">fructose</a> and other ingredients.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Phase_transitions">Phase transitions</span></h3>
<p>The melting point of crystallized honey is between {{convert|40|and|50|C|F}}, depending on its composition. Below this temperature, honey can be either in a <a href="/Metastable" title="Metastable">metastable</a> state, meaning that it will not crystallize until a <a href="/Seed_crystal" title="Seed crystal">seed crystal</a> is added, or, more often, it is in a &#34;labile&#34; state, being saturated with enough sugars to crystallize spontaneously.&#60;ref&#62;<a href="#Root">Root</a>, p. 355&#60;/ref&#62; The rate of crystallization is affected by many factors, but the primary factor is the ratio of the main sugars: fructose to glucose. Honeys that are supersaturated with a very high percentage of glucose, such as <a href="/Brassica" title="Brassica">brassica</a> honey, will crystallize almost immediately after harvesting, while honeys with a low percentage of glucose, such as chestnut or <a href="/Tupelo" title="Tupelo">tupelo</a> honey, do not crystallize. Some types of honey may produce very large but few crystals, while others will produce many small crystals.&#60;ref name=&#34;Piotr Tomasik p. 74&#34;&#62;Tomasik, Piotr (2004) <i>Chemical and functional properties of food saccharides</i>, CRC Press, p. 74, <a class="external text" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0849314860" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0849314860">ISBN 0-8493-1486-0</a>&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>Crystallization is also affected by water content, because a high percentage of water will inhibit crystallization, as will a high <a href="/Dextrin" title="Dextrin">dextrin</a> content. Temperature also affects the rate of crystallization, with the fastest growth occurring between {{convert|13|and|17|C|F}}. Crystal nuclei (seeds) tend to form more readily if the honey is disturbed, by stirring, shaking or agitating, rather than if left at rest. However, the <a href="/Nucleation" title="Nucleation">nucleation</a> of microscopic seed-crystals is greatest between {{convert|5|and|8|C|F}}. Therefore, larger but fewer crystals tend to form at higher temperatures, while smaller but more-numerous crystals usually form at lower temperatures. Below 5&#38;nbsp;°C, the honey will not crystallize and, thus, the original texture and flavor can be preserved indefinitely.&#60;ref name=&#34;Piotr Tomasik p. 74&#34;/&#62;</p>
<p>Since honey normally exists below its melting point, it is a supercooled liquid. At very low temperatures, honey will not freeze solid. Instead, as the temperatures become lower, the viscosity of honey increases. Like most <a href="/Viscous_liquid" title="Viscous liquid">viscous liquids</a>, the honey will become thick and sluggish with decreasing temperature. At {{convert|-20|C|F}}, honey may appear or even feel solid, but it will continue to flow at very low rates.

<p>The <a href="/Viscosity" title="Viscosity">viscosity</a> of honey is affected greatly by both temperature and water content. The higher the water percentage, the easier honey <a href="/Fluid_dynamics" title="Fluid dynamics">flows</a>. Above its melting point, however, water has little effect on viscosity. Aside from water content, the composition of honey also has little effect on viscosity, with the exception of a few types. At {{convert|25|C|F}}, honey with 14% water content generally has a viscosity around 400 <a href="/Poise" title="Poise">poise</a>, while a honey containing 20% water has a viscosity around 20 poise. Viscosity increase due to temperature occurs very slowly at first. A honey containing 16% water, at {{convert|70|C|F}}, will have a viscosity around 2 poise, while at {{convert|30|C|F}}, the viscosity is around 70 poise. As cooling progresses, honey becomes more viscous at an increasingly rapid rate, reaching 600 poise around {{convert|14|C|F}}.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Hygroscopy_and_fermentation">Hygroscopy and fermentation</span></h3>
<p>Honey has the ability to absorb moisture directly from the air, a phenomenon called <a href="/Hygroscopy" title="Hygroscopy">hygroscopy</a>. The amount of water the honey will absorb is dependent on the relative humidity of the air. Because honey contains <a href="/Yeast" title="Yeast">yeast</a>, this hygroscopic nature requires that honey be stored in sealed containers to prevent <a href="/Fermentation_(food)" title="Fermentation (food)">fermentation</a>, which usually begins if the honey&#39;s water content rises much above 25%. Honey will tend to absorb more water in this manner than the individual sugars would allow on their own, which may be due to other ingredients it contains.&#60;ref name=&#34;Bee Culture&#39; Page 348&#34;/&#62;</p>
<p>Fermentation of honey will usually occur after crystallization because, without the glucose, the liquid portion of the honey primarily consists of a concentrated mixture of the fructose, acids, and water, providing the yeast with enough of an increase in the water percentage for growth.

<p>In jars, fresh honey should appear as a pure, consistent fluid, and should not set in layers. Within a few weeks to a few months of extraction, many varieties of honey crystallize into a cream-colored solid. Some varieties of honey, including tupelo, acacia, and sage, crystallize less regularly. Honey may be heated during bottling at temperatures of {{convert|40|–|49|C|F}} to delay or inhibit crystallization. Overheating is indicated by change in enzyme levels, for instance, <a href="/Diastase" title="Diastase">diastase</a> activity, which can be determined with the Schade or the <a href="/Phadebas" title="Phadebas">Phadebas</a> methods.

<p>Because of its unique composition and chemical properties, honey is suitable for long-term storage, and is easily assimilated even after long preservation. Honey, and objects immersed in honey, have been preserved for centuries.&#60;ref&#62;&#34;<a class="external text" href="https://books.google.com/books?id=i0hNLjVL49oC&#38;pg=PA83" rel="nofollow">The History of the Origin and Development of Museums</a>&#34;.

If exposed to moist air, its <a href="/Hydrophilic" title="Hydrophilic">hydrophilic</a> properties will pull moisture into the honey, eventually diluting it to the point that fermentation can begin.</p>

<p>In Jewish tradition, honey is a symbol for the new year, <a href="/Rosh_Hashanah" title="Rosh Hashanah">Rosh Hashanah</a>. At the traditional meal for that holiday, apple slices are dipped in honey and eaten to bring a sweet new year. Some Rosh Hashanah greetings show honey and an apple, symbolizing the feast. In some congregations, small straws of honey are given out to usher in the new year.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}</p>
<p>The <a href="/Hebrew_Bible" title="Hebrew Bible">Hebrew Bible</a> contains many references to honey. In the <a href="/Book_of_Judges" title="Book of Judges">Book of Judges</a>, Samson found a swarm of bees and honey in the carcass of a lion (14:8). In Old Testament law, offerings were made in the temple to God. The <a href="/Book_of_Leviticus" title="Book of Leviticus">Book of Leviticus</a> says that &#34;Every grain offering you bring to the Lord must be made without yeast, for you are not to burn any yeast or honey in a food offering presented to the Lord&#34; (2:11).
