Generally regarded as the most pleasant taste, <a href="/Sweetness" title="Sweetness">sweetness</a> is almost always caused by a type of simple <a href="/Sugar" title="Sugar">sugar</a> such as <a href="/Glucose" title="Glucose">glucose</a> or <a href="/Fructose" title="Fructose">fructose</a>, or <a href="/Disaccharides" title="Disaccharides">disaccharides</a> such as <a href="/Sucrose" title="Sucrose">sucrose</a>, a molecule combining glucose and fructose.&#60;ref name=&#34;New Oxford American Dictionary&#34;&#62;New Oxford American Dictionary&#60;/ref&#62; Complex carbohydrates are long chains and thus do not have the sweet taste. Artificial sweeteners such as <a href="/Sucralose" title="Sucralose">sucralose</a> are used to mimic the sugar molecule, creating the sensation of sweet, without the calories. Other types of sugar include <a href="/Raw_sugar" title="Raw sugar">raw sugar</a>, which is known for its amber color, as it is unprocessed.

<p>There are many different types of equipment used for cooking.</p>
<p><a href="/Oven" title="Oven">Ovens</a> are mostly hollow devices that get very hot (up to 500&#38;nbsp;°F) and are used for baking or roasting and offer a dry-heat cooking method. Different cuisines will use different types of ovens; for example, Indian culture uses a <a href="/Tandoor" title="Tandoor">Tandoor</a> oven, which is a cylindrical clay oven which operates at a single high temperature.&#60;ref&#62;Davidson, 782–783&#60;/ref&#62; Western kitchens use variable temperature <a href="/Convection_oven" title="Convection oven">convection ovens</a>, conventional ovens, <a href="/Toaster_oven" title="Toaster oven">toaster ovens</a>, or non-radiant heat ovens like the <a href="/Microwave_oven" title="Microwave oven">microwave oven</a>.

<p>Various types of cook-tops are used as well. They carry the same variations of fuel types as the ovens mentioned above.

<p>In addition, many cultures use grills for cooking. A <a href="/Grill_(cooking)" title="Grill (cooking)">grill</a> operates with a radiant heat source from below, usually covered with a metal grid and sometimes a cover. An open pit barbecue in the American south is one example along with the American style outdoor grill fueled by wood, liquid propane, or charcoal along with soaked wood chips for smoking.&#60;ref&#62;Davidson, 356.&#60;/ref&#62; A <a href="/Mexican_cuisine" title="Mexican cuisine">Mexican</a> style of barbecue is called <a href="/Barbacoa" title="Barbacoa">barbacoa</a>, which involves the cooking of meats such as whole sheep over an open fire.

{{main|Food marketing}}
<a href="/Food_marketing" title="Food marketing">Food marketing</a> brings together the producer and the consumer. It is the chain of activities that brings food from &#34;farm gate to plate&#34;.&#60;ref&#62;Wansink, <i><a href="/Marketing_Nutrition" title="Marketing Nutrition">Marketing Nutrition</a></i>, 501–3.&#60;/ref&#62; The marketing of even a single food product can be a complicated process involving many producers and companies. For example, fifty-six companies are involved in making one <a href="/Canning" title="Canning">can</a> of chicken noodle soup. These businesses include not only chicken and vegetable processors but also the companies that transport the ingredients and those who print labels and manufacture cans.&#60;ref&#62;Smith, 501–3.&#60;/ref&#62; The food marketing system is the largest direct and indirect non-government employer in the United States.</p>
<p>In the pre-modern era, the sale of surplus food took place once a week when farmers took their wares on market day into the local village marketplace. Here food was sold to <a href="/Grocer" title="Grocer">grocers</a> for sale in their local shops for purchase by local consumers.&#60;ref name=&#34;silhnc&#34;/&#62;&#60;ref name=Jango/&#62; With the onset of industrialization and the development of the food processing industry, a wider range of food could be sold and distributed in distant locations. Typically early grocery shops would be counter-based shops, in which purchasers told the shop-keeper what they wanted, so that the shop-keeper could get it for them.&#60;ref name=&#34;silhnc&#34;/&#62;&#60;ref&#62;Benson&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>In the 20th century, <a href="/Supermarket" title="Supermarket">supermarkets</a> were born. Supermarkets brought with them a <a href="/Self_service" title="Self service">self service</a> approach to shopping using <a href="/Shopping_cart" title="Shopping cart">shopping carts</a>, and were able to offer quality food at lower cost through <a href="/Economies_of_scale" title="Economies of scale">economies of scale</a> and reduced staffing costs. In the latter part of the 20th century, this has been further revolutionized by the development of vast warehouse-sized, out-of-town supermarkets, selling a wide range of food from around the world.&#60;ref&#62;Humphery&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>Unlike food processors, food retailing is a two-tier market in which a small number of very large <a href="/Corporation" title="Corporation">companies</a> control a large proportion of supermarkets. The supermarket giants wield great purchasing power over farmers and processors, and strong influence over consumers. Nevertheless, less than 10% of consumer spending on food goes to farmers, with larger percentages going to <a href="/Advertising" title="Advertising">advertising</a>, transportation, and intermediate corporations.&#60;ref&#62;Magdoff, Fred (Ed.) &#34;[T]he farmer&#39;s share of the food dollar (after paying for input costs) has steadily declined from about 40 percent in 1910 to less than 10 percent in 1990.&#34;&#60;/ref&#62;</p>

It is rare for the spikes to hit all major foods in most countries at once. Food prices rose 4% in the United States in 2007, the highest increase since 1990, and are expected to climb as much again in 2008. As of December 2007, 37 countries faced food crises, and 20 had imposed some sort of food-price controls. In China, the price of <a href="/Pork" title="Pork">pork</a> jumped 58% in 2007. In the 1980s and 1990s, farm subsidies and support programs allowed major grain exporting countries to hold large surpluses, which could be tapped during food shortages to keep prices down. However, new trade policies have made agricultural production much more responsive to market demands, putting global food reserves at their lowest since 1983.&#60;ref name=&#34;cnn24march2008&#34;&#62;&#34;Food prices rising across the world&#34;, CNN. 24 March 2008&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>Food prices are rising, wealthier Asian consumers are westernizing their diets, and farmers and nations of the third world are struggling to keep up the pace. The past five years have seen rapid growth in the contribution of Asian nations to the global fluid and powdered milk manufacturing industry, which in 2008 accounted for more than 30% of production, while China alone accounts for more than 10% of both production and consumption in the global fruit and vegetable processing and preserving industry. The trend is similarly evident in industries such as soft drink and bottled water manufacturing, as well as global cocoa, chocolate, and sugar confectionery manufacturing, forecast to grow by 5.7% and 10.0% respectively during 2008 in response to soaring demand in Chinese and Southeast Asian markets.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.ibisworld.com/newsletter/issues/us/08may/news.htm:" rel="nofollow">May 2008, Global Trends: – Food Production and Consumption: The China Effect</a>{{Dead link|date=December 2013}}, <i>IBISWorld</i>&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>Rising food prices over recent years have been linked with social unrest around the world, including rioting in <a href="/Bangladesh" title="Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a> and <a href="/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>,&#60;ref name=&#34;Ind&#34;/&#62; and the <a href="/Arab_Spring" title="Arab Spring">Arab Spring</a>.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}</p>
<p>In 2013 <a href="/Overseas_Development_Institute" title="Overseas Development Institute">Overseas Development Institute</a> researchers showed that <a href="/Rice" title="Rice">rice</a> has more than doubled in price since 2000, rising by 120% in real terms. This was as a result of shifts in trade policy and restocking by major producers. More fundamental drivers of increased prices are the higher costs of fertiliser, diesel and labour. Parts of Asia see rural wages rise with potential large benefits for the 1.3 billion (2008 estimate) of Asia&#39;s poor in reducing the poverty they face. However, this negatively impacts more vulnerable groups who don&#39;t share in the economic boom, especially in Asian and African coastal cities. The researchers said the threat means social-protection policies are needed to guard against price shocks. The research proposed that in the longer run, the rises present opportunities to export for Western African farmers with high potential for rice production to replace imports with domestic production.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.odi.org.uk/publications/7687-end-cheap-rice-prices-rural-labour-wages" rel="nofollow">Steve Wiggins and Sharada Keats, August 2013,  The end of cheap rice: a cause for celebration?

Less commonly, acute adverse reactions can also occur if chemical contamination of food occurs, for example from improper storage, or use of non-food grade soaps and disinfectants. Food can also be adulterated by a very wide range of articles (known as &#34;foreign bodies&#34;) during farming, manufacture, cooking, packaging, distribution, or sale. These foreign bodies can include pests or their droppings, hairs, cigarette butts, wood chips, and all manner of other contaminants. It is possible for certain types of food to become contaminated if stored or presented in an unsafe container, such as a ceramic pot with lead-based glaze.&#60;ref name=MedlinePlus/&#62;</p>
