This paper presents a new approach to bitext correspondence problem  ( BCP ) of noisy bilingual corpora based on image processing  ( IP ) techniques . 
By using one of several ways of estimating the lexical translation probability  ( LTP ) between pairs of source and target words , we can turn a bitext into a discrete gray-level image  . We contend that the BCP , when seen in this light , bears a striking resemblance to the line detection problem in IP  . 
Therefore , BCPs , including sentence and word alignment , can benefit from a wealth of effective , well established IP techniques , including convolution-based filters , texture analysis and Hough transform . This paper describes a new program , PlotAlign that produces a word-level bitext map for noisy or nonliteral bitext  , based on these techniques . 
Keywords : alignment , bilingual corpus , image processing 1 . Introduction Aligned corpora have proved very useful in many tasks  , including statistical machine translation , bilingual lexicography ( Daille , Gaussier and Lange 1993) , and word sense disambiguation ( Gale , Church and Yarowsky 1992; Chen , Ker , Sheng , and Chang 1997) . Several methods have recently been proposed for sentence alignment of the Hansards  , an English-French corpus of Canadian parliamentary debates  ( Brown , Lai and Mercer 1991 ; Gale and Church 1991a ; Simard , Foster and Isabelle 1992; Chen 1993) , and for other language pairs such as English German  , English Chinese , and English-Japanese ( Church , Dagan , Gale , Fung , Helfman and Satish 1993 ; Kay and Rtischeisen 1993 ; Wu 1994) . 
The statistical approach to machine translation ( SMT ) can be understood as a word-by-word model consisting of two submodels : a language model for generating a source text segment S and a translation model for mapping Sto its translation T  . Brown et al ( 1993 ) also recommend using a bilingual corpus to train the parameters of Pr  ( SI 73 , translation probability ( TP ) in the translation model . In the context of SMT , Brown et al ( 1993 ) present a series of five models of Pr ( SI 73 for word alignment . The authors propose using an adaptive Expectation and Maximization  ( EM ) algorithm to estimate parameters for lexical translation probability  ( LTP ) and distortion probability ( DP )  , two factors in the TP , from an aligned bitext . The EM algorithm iterates between two phases to estimate LTP and DP until both functions converge  . 
Church ( 1993 ) observes that reliably distinguishing sentence boundaries for a noisy bitext obtained from an OCR device is quite difficult  . Dagan , Church and Gale ( 1993 ) recommend aligning words directly withouthe preprocessing phase of sentence alignment  . They propose using char_align to produce a rough characterlevel alignment first  . The rough alignment provides a basis for estimating the translation probability based on position  , as well as limits the range of target words being considered for each source word  . 
Char_align ( Church 1993 ) is based on the observation that there are many instances of  .

cognates among the languages in the Indo-European family  . However , Fung and Church ( 1994 ) point out that such a constraint does not exist between languages across language groups such as Chinese and English  . The authors propose a K vecapproach which is based on a k-way partition of the bilingual corpus  . Fung and McKeown ( 1994 ) propose using a similar measure based on Dynamic Time Warping  ( DTW ) between occurrence r cency sequences to improve on the Kvec method  . 
The char-align , Kvec and DTW approaches rely on dynamic programming strategy to reach a rough alignment  . As Chen (1993) points out , dynamic programming is particularly susceptible to deletions occurring in one of the two languages  . 
Thus , dynamic programming based sentence alignment algorithms rely on paragraph anchors  ( Brown et al 1991 ) or lexical information , such as cognates ( Simard 1992) , to maintain a high accuracy rate . These methods are not robust with respect to nonliteral translations and large deletions  ( Simard 1996 )  . This paper presents a new approach based on image processing  ( IP ) techniques , which is immune to such predicaments . 
2 . BCP as image processing 2 . 1 Estimation of LTP A wide variety of ways of LTP estimation have been proposed in the literature of computational linguistics  , including Dice coefficient ( Kay and R6scheisen 1993 )  , mutual information , ~2 ( Gale and Church 1991b ) , dictionary and thesaurus Table 1 . Linguistic constraints . Linguistic constraints at various level of alignment resolution give rise to differentypes of image pattern that are susceptible to well established IP techniques  .

Dice coefficient :
Dice(s , t ) = 2 . prob(s , t ) prob ( s ) + prob ( t ) mutual information : Ml ( s , t ) = log prob(s , t ) prob(s ) , prob(t ) Like the image of a natural scene , the linguistic or statistical estimate of LTP gives rise to signal as well as noise  . These signal and noise can be viewed as a gray -level dotplot  ( Church and Gale 1991 )  , as Figure 1 shows . 
We observe that the BCP , when cast as a gray-level image , bears a striking resemblance to IP problems , including edge detection , texture classification , and line detection . Therefore , the BCP can benefit from a wealth of effective , well established IP techniques , including convolution-based filtering , texture analysis , and Hough transform . 
2.2 Properties of aligned corpora
The PlotAlign algorithms are based on three linguistic constraints that can be observed at different level of alignment resolution  , including phrase , sentence , and discourse : tion target of a word tend to be located next to that of its neighboring words  . 
2 . One-to . one constraint : Each source word token connect to at most one target word token  . 
3 Non-crossing constraint : The connection target of a sentence does not come before that of its preceding sentence  . 
He hopes to achieve all his aims by the end of the year 
Figure 2.

Short edges and textural pattern in a dotplot . The shaded cells are positions where a high LTP value is registered  . The cell with a dark dot in it is an alignment connection  . 
Each of these constraints lead to a specific pattern in the dotplot  . The structure preserving constraint means that the connections of adjacent words tend to form short  , diagonal edges on the dotplot . For instance , Figure 2 shows that the adjacent words such as " He hopes " and " achieve all " lead to diagonal edges  , 00 and 00 in the dotplot . 
However , edges with different orientation may also appear due to some morphological constraints  . 
For instance , the token " aim " connects to a Mandarin compound "I ~ ~  . , " thereby gives rise to the horizontal edge 00 . The one-to-one assumption leads to a textural pattern that can be categorized as region of dense dots distributed much like thel's in a permutation matrix  . For instance , the vicinity of connection dot O(end , )~ , ) is denser than that of a non-connection say ( end ,  ) . Furthermore , the narby connections @ , O , and 0 , form a texture much like a permutation matrix with roughly one dotper row and per column  . The noncrossing assumption means that the connection target of a sentence will not come before that of its preceding sentence  . For instance , Figure 1 shows that there are clearly two long lines representing a sequence of sentences where this constraint holds  . The gap between these two lines results from the deletion of several sentences in the translation process  .

2 . 3 Convolution and local edge detection Convolution is the method of choice for enhancing and detecting the edges in an image  . For noise or incomplete image , as in the case of LTP dotplot , a discrete convolution-based filter is effective in filling a missing or underestimated dot which is surrounded by neighboring dots with high LTP value according to the structure preserving constraint  . A filtering mask stipulates the relative location of these supporting dots  . The filtering can be proceed as follows to obtain Pr  ( sx , ty ) , the t(sx+i , ty+j ) , the LTP values of itself and neighboring cells : Pr  ( sx , tr ) = ~~ t(sx+i , t y , j)?mask(i , j ) j = . wi=-w where w is a predetermined parameter specifying the size of the convolution filter  . Connections that fall outside this window are assumed to have no affect on Pr  ( sx , ty ) . 
For simplicity , two 3x3 filters can be employed to detect and accentuate hesignal :  -1   -1   -1   2   -1   -1   2   2   2   -1   2   -1   -1   -1   -1   -1   -1   2 However , a5 by 5 filter , empirically derived from the data , performs much better .

First , the dotplot should be normalized and binarized , leaving the expected number of dots , in order to reduce complexity and simplify computation  . Then , projectional transformation to either or both axes of the languages involved will compress the data further without losing too much information  . That further reduces the 2D texture discrimination task to a 1D problem . For instance , Figure 4 shows that the vicinity of a connection ( by , ~ r ) is characterized by evenly distributed high LTP values  , while that of a non-connection is not . 
According to the one-to-one constraint , we should be looking for dense and continuous 1D occurrence of dots . A cell with high density and high power density indicate that connections fall on the vicinity of the cell  . With this in mind , we proceed as follows to extract features for textural discrimination :  1  . Normalize the LTP value row-wise and column-wise . 
2 . For a window of nxm cells , set the t(s , t ) values of k cells with highest LTP values to 1 and the rest to 0  , k = max(n , m ) . 
3 . Compute the density and deviation features : projection : 
It p(x , y ) = ~ , t(x , y + j ) j=-v density : d(x , y ) = w
Y ~ p(x+i , y ) i ~ w2w+1 power density : pd(x , y ) = ~* ~* p(x ' , y) . p(x'-i , y )   i=1 x '= x-w where w and v are the width and height of a window for feature extraction  , and c is the bound for the resolution of texture . The bound depends on the coverage rate of LTP estimates  ; 2 or 3 seems to produce satisfactory results . 
Since the one-to-one constraint is a sentence level phenomena  , the values for w and v should be chosen to correspond to the lengths of average sentences in each of the two languages  . 
2.5 Hough transform and line detection
The purpose of Hough transform ( HT ) algorithm , in short , is to map all points of a line in the original space to a single accumulative value in the parameter space  . We can describe a line on xy plane in the form p = x  . s in 0+ y . cos0 . Therefore , the xyplane . Furthermore , HT is insensitive to perturbation i the sense the line of  ( p , 0) is very close to that of ( p+Ap , 0 + A0) . That enables HT-based line detection algorithm to fred high resolution  , one-pixel-widelines , as well as lower-resolution lines .

As mentioned above , many alignment algorithms rely on anchors , such as cognates , to keep alignment on track . However , that is only possible for bitext of certain language pairs and text genres  . For a clean bitext , such as the Hansards , most dynamic programming based algorithms perform well  ( Simard 1996 )  . To the contrary , a noisy bitext with large deletions , inversions and nonliteral translations will appear as disconnected segments on the dotplot  . Gaps between these segments may over power dynamic programming  , and lead to a low precision rate . 
Simard (1996) shows that for the Hansards corpus , most sentence-align algorithms yield a precision rate over  90%  . For a noisy corpus , such as literary bitext , the rate drops below 50% . 
Contrary to the dynamic programming based methods , Hough transform always detec the most apparent line segments even in a noisy dotplot  . 
Before applying Hough transform , the same processes of normalization and thresholding are performed first  . The algorithm is described as follows : 1 . Normalize the LTP value row-wise and column-wise . 
2 . For a window of nxm cells , set the t(s , t ) values of k cells with highest LTP values to 1 and the rest to 0  , k = max(n , m ) . 
3 . Set incidence(p ,  0) = 0 , for all-k < p < k ,  -90 ? <0<0 ? ,  4 . For each cell ( x , y ) , t(x , y ) = 1 and -90 ?<0 <0? , increment incidence ( x cos0 + ysin 0 , 0) by 1 . 
5 . Keep(p , 0) pairs that have high incidence value , incidence(p ,  0) > ~ ,  . Subsequently , filter out dot(x , y ) that does not lie on such a line , ( p , 0) or within a certain distance ~ i from ( p ,  0) . 
3. Experiments
To asses the effectiveness of the PlotAlign algorithms  , we conducted a series of experiments . 
A novel and its translation was chosen as the test data  . For simplicity , we have selected mutual information to estimate LTP  . Statistics of mutual information between a source and target words is estimated using an outside source  , example sentences and translation i the Longman English Chinese Dictionary of Contemporary English  ( LecDOCE , Longman Group ,  1992) . An additional list of some 3 , 2 00 English person names and Chinese translations are used to enhance the coverage of proper nouns in the bitext  .

Figure 5 displays the result of word alignment by a human judge  . Only 40% of English text and 70% of Chinese text have a connection counterpart . This indicates the translation is not literal and there are many deletions  . For instance , the following sentences are freely translated : la  . It was only a quarter to eleven .

He walked on the opposite side of the street from her  ; using a zoom lens , he had already shot a whole roll of film . When they came to Seventy-ninth Street , he caught a real break when she crossed over to him  , and here alise dhe might be able to squeeze off full-face shots  . Maybe , i it clouded over more , she might take off her dark glasses . That would be a real coup . 
4. Result and Discussion
Figure 6 shows that the coverage and precision of the LTP estimate is not very high  . That is to be expected since the translation is not literal and the mutual information estimate based on an outside source might not be relevant  . Nevertheless , PlotAlign algorithm seem to be robust enough to produce reasonably high precision that can be seen from Figure  3  . Figure 3 ( a ) shows that a normalization and thresholding process based on one-to-one constraints does a good job of filtering out noise  . Figure 3 ( b ) shows that convolution-based filtering remove more noise according to the assumption of structure preserving constraint  . 
Texture analysis does an even better job in noise suppression  . Figure 7 ( a ) and 7 ( b ) show that signal-to-noise ratio ( SNR ) is greatly improved . 
The filtering based on Hough Transform , contrary to the other two filtering methods , prefers connection that is consistent with other connections globally  . It does a pretty good job of identifying along line segment  . However , isolated , short segments , urrounded by deletions are likely to be missed out  . Figure 8 ( b ) shows that filtering based on HT missed out the short line segment appearing near the center of the dotplot shown in Figure  6  ( b )  . 
Nevertheless , this short segment presents most vividly in the result of textural filter  , shown in Figure 7(b ) . By combining filters on all three levels of resolution  , we gather as much evidence as possible for optimal result  .

5. Conclusion
The algorithm's performance discussed herein can definitely be improved by enhancing the various components of the algorithms  , e . g . introducing bilingual dictionaries and thesauri . However , the PlotAlign algorithms constitute a functional core for processing noisy bitext  . While the evaluation is based on an English Chinese bitext  , the linguistic constraints motivating the algorithms seem to be quite general and  , to a large extent , language independent . If that is the case , the algorithms prospects for English-Japanese or Chinese-Japanese  , in particular , seem highly promising . 
Performing the alignment task as image processing proves to be an effective approach and sheds new light on the bitext correspondence problem  . We are currently looking at the possibilities of exploiting powerful and well established IP techniques to attack other problems in natural language processing  .
