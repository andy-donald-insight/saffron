This paper proposes a system of map-
ping classes of syntactic structures as
instruments for automatic text under-
standing . The system illustrated in Japanese consists of a set of verb classes and information on mapping them together with noun phrases  , tense and aspect . The system . having information on direction of possible inferences between the verb classes with information on tense and aspect  , is supposed to be utilized for reasoning in automatic text understanding  . 
I . INTRODUCTION
The purpose of this paper is to propose a system of mapping classes of syntactic structures as instruments for automatic text understanding  . The system consists of a set of verb classes and Jnfor-matlon on mapping them together with noun phrases  , tense and aspect , and \] s supposed to heutilized for inference in automatic text understanding  . 
The language used for illustration of the system is Japanese  . 
There Is a tendency for non-syntactic analysers and semantic grammars In automatic text understanding  . However . this proposal Is motivated by the fact that syntactic structures  , once analyzed and classified in terms of semant ic relatedness  , provide much information for " understanding . This is supported by the fact that human beings use syntactically related sentences when they ask questions about texts  . 
The system we are proposing has the following elements :  1  ) Verb classes . 
2 ) Mapping of noun phrases between or among some verb classes  . 
3 ) Direction of possible infel'ence between the classes with information on tense and aspect  . 
Our experiment , in which subjects are asked to make true-false questions about certain texts  , revealed that native speakers think that they understand texts by deducting sentences lexical ly or semanti-cally related  . For instance , a human being relates questions such as ' Did Mary go to a theater ?' to a sentence in texts such as ' John took Mary to a theater  . ' Or , by the same sentence , he understands that ' Mary was in the theater . "
II . FEATURES OF THEJAPANESESYNTAX
Features of , Japanese syntax relevant to the discussion in this paper are presented below  . 
The sentence usually ha:#case markings as postpositions to noun phrases  . For instance . 
I . John qa Mary D_J_himitsuo hanashita ' John told a secret to Mary  . ' In sentence 1 . postpositions ga . n i and o indicate nominative , dative all daccusa-tive . respectively . 

However . postposJtions do not unique-ymap to deep cases  . Take the followitlg sentences for example . 
2. John ~ ia_sanii Bi_itta.
" John went at : ? o'cio(-k .  ' 3  . John w_a Tokyor ! titta . 
" John ~, ~' ellt to Tokyo .  " 4  . Johr ~ w ; ~ Tokyo ILI : ~ undeiru . 
' John lives in Tokyo.'
Ni in the sentences 2, 3.4 indicate time.
goal and location , respectively . This is due to the verb caegory ( 3 and 41 OF the class of noun phrases ( 2 and 31 appearing in each sentence . 
Certain mor'phemc classes hide the case marking . e . g . 
5. John ~ Qitta.
" John also went ( y ; ome where).
6. Tokyomoitta.
' Someone went to Tokyo also.'
The moin sentence 5 and 6 means ' also'.
Therefore these sentences are derived from dif ferent syntactical constructions  , that is . sentences 7 and 8 . respectively . 
7. John gaitt a .
" John went ( somewhere ).'8. Tokyon__kiitta.
? Someone went to Tokyo."
Furthermore . as illustrated in sentences 5 through 6 , noun phrases , lay be deleted freely , provided the context gives full information . In sentences 6 and 7 . a noun phrase indicating the goal is missing and sentences  6 and 8 lack thal indicating the subject . Finally . there are many pairs of lexical Ly related verbs  , tz ' ansitire and inst\]a ~ itire , indicating the: ; a mephenomenon differently 9 . John gat , 4 ary nihonom_!seta . 
", h ) hn showed a hook to Mary.
10. Mal'y gahono ! ~ ita.
" Uary saw a book . '
The two expressions , or viewpoints , on the same phenomenon , that is , ' John showed to Mary a book which she saw . ' are related in Japanese by the verb root ~_l . 
The system under consideration utilizes some of the above features  ( case marking and lexically related verbs ) and in turn can be used to ease difficulties of automatic understanding  , caused by some other features ( case hiding , ambiguious case marking and deletion of noun phrases  .  )
III . VERB CLASS
The system is illustrated below with verbs related to the notion of movement  . 
The verb classes in this category are as fol lows :  ( 1  ) Verb class of causality of movement tCM ) 
Examples : tsureteiku ' to take ( a person ) ' tsurete kuru ' to bring ( a person ) " hakobu ' to carry " yaru ' to give " oshieru " to tell ' Verbs of this class indicate that someone causes something or someone moves  . How to move varies as seen later . 
(2) Verb class of movement ( MV )
Examples : iku " togo'kuru ' to come " idousuru " to move " Verbs of this class indicated that some-thing or someone moves from one place to another  . 
(3) Verb class of existence ( EX )
Examples : iru ' ( animate ) be " aru " ( inanimate ) be ' Verbs of this class indicate the ex is tence of something or someone  . 
410 (4) Verb class of possesslon ( PS)
Examples : motsu ' to possess'kau ' tokeep ' Verbs of this class indicate someone's possession of something or someone  . 
the case slot . As seen below , the difference between yaru , ' to give ' and uru , ' to sell'is that the latter has'money'as instrument  , while the former does not . Incidentally , Japanese has a verb yuzuru which can be used whether the instruh~ent 
Is money or not.
Notice that the fundamental notion of MOVE here is much wider than the normal meaning of the word ' move '  . When someone learns some idea from someone else . it is understood that an abstract notion moves from the former to the latter  . 
IV . MAPPING OF SYNTACTIC STRUCTURES
Furthermore , verbs of each class dif-fer slightly f rome ach other in semantic structures  . But the difference is de-scribed as di fference in features filling

inference would be possible among sentences II through  14 in automatic text understanding . Furthermore . this system can also be utilized in the automatic text understanding by locating missing noun phrases and determining ambiguous grammatical cases in the sentence  , finding seman-tically related sentences between the questions and the text  , and gathering the right semantic information . 
By the ~ ie conditions , the mapping of syntactic structures presented in Diagram II is transformed to that in terms of individual verbs  . Furthermore , rules of di-rections for reasoning presented in Dia-gram IV connect specific sentences  . 
Take the following sentence for example.
Since this system uses information on syntactic structures  , it is much simpler in terms of the semantics t ructures than the Conceptual Dependence y Model  , for instance , and the mapping among the sentence patterns semantically related much more explicit  .
