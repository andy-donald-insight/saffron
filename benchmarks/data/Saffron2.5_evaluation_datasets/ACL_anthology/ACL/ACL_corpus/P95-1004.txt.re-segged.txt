Abstract ?
This paper introduces a spelling correction system which integrates eamlessly with morphological analysis using a multitape formalism  . Handling of various Semitic error problems is illustrated  , with reference to Arabic and Syriac examples . The model handles errors vocalisation , diacritics , phonetic syncopation and morphographemic idiosyncrasies  , in addition to Damerau errors . A complementary correction strategy for morphologically sound but morphosyntactically ill -formed words is outlined  . 
1 Introduction
Semitic is known amongst computational linguists , in particular computational morphologists , for its highly inflexional morphology . Its root-and-pattern phenomenonotonly poses difficulties for a morphological system  , but also makes error detection a difficult task . This paper aims at presenting a morphographemic model which can cope with both issues  . 
The following convention has been adopted . Morphemes are represented in braces ,    , surface ( phonological ) forms in solidi ,  / /  , and orthographic strings in a cute brackets ,  ()  . In examples of grammars , variables begin with a capital letter . Cs denote consonants , Vs denote vowels and a bar denotes complement . An asterisk , *, indicates ill-formed strings . 
The difficulties in morphological nalysis and error detection in Semitic arise from the following facts : * Supported by a British Telecom Scholarship  , administered by the Cambridge Common wealth Trust in conjunction with the Foreignsad Common wealth Office  .

Non-Linearity A Semitic stem consists of a root and a vowel melody  , arranged according to a canonical pattern . For example , Arabic/kuttib/'caused to write-perfect passive ' is composed from the root morpheme ktb ' notion of writing ' and the vowel melody morphemeul ' perfect passive '  ; the two are arranged according to the pattern morpheme CVCC VC'causative '  . This phenomenon is analysed by ( McCarthy ,  1981 ) along the fines of autosegmental phonology ( Goldsmith ,  1976) . 
The analysis appears in (1).1(1)
DERIVATION OF/kuttib/ui
II/kuttib/--CVCCV Caviktb ? Vocalisation Orthographically  , Semitic texts appear in three forms : ( i ) consonantal texts do not incorporate any short vowels but ma-tteslection is  , 2e . g . Arabic ( ktb ) for / katab/ , /kutib / and / kutub / , but ( kaatb ) for/kaatab/and/kaatib/ ;   ( ii ) partially voealised texts incorporate some short vowels to clarify ambiguity  , e . g .   ( kutb ) for/kutib/to distinguishit from/katab/ ; and ( iii ) voealised texts incorporate full vocalisation , e . g . ( tadahra \]) for/tadaay . 
1We have used the CV model to describe pattern morphemes instead of prosodic terms because of its familiarity in the computational linguistics literature  . For the use of moraics adaff Lxational models in handling Arabic morphology computationally  , see ( Kiraz , ) . 
2'M others of reading ' , these are consonantal letters which play the role of long vowels  , sad are represented in the pattern morpheme by VV  ( e . g . / aa /, / uu /, / ii /) . Matteslection is cannot be omitted from the orthographic string  . 
2 4 ? Vowel and Diacritic Shifts Semitic languages employ a large number of diacritics to represent enter alia short vowels  , doubled letters , and nunation .   3 Most editors allow the user to enter such diacritics above and below letters  . 
To speed data entry , the user usually enters the base characters ( say a paragraph ) and then goes back and enters the diacritics . A common mistake is to place the cursor one extra position to the left when entering diacritics  . This results in the vowels being shifted one position  , e . g . *( wkatubi ) instead of ( wakutib) . 
? Vocalisms The quality of the perfect and imperfect vowels of the basic forms of the Semitic verbs are idiosyncratic  . For example , the Syria crootktb takes the perfect vowel a , e . g . 
/ ktab/ , while the root nht takes the vowele , e . g . /nhet / . It is common among learners to make mistakes such as*/kteb/or*/nhat /  . 
? Phonetic Syncopation A consonantal segment may be omitted from the phonetic surface form  , but maintained in the orthographic surface from . For example , Syriac(md/nt ~) ' city ' is pronounced/mdit ~/ . 
* Idiosyncrasies The application of a morphographemic rule may have constraints as on which lexical morphemes it may or may not apply  . For example , the glottal stop\[~\] at the end of a stem may become\[w\]when followed by the relative adjective morphemeiy y  , as in Arabic/samaa P + i y y /-+/ sama awiy y /' heavenly '  , but/hawaa P + iyy / - ~ / hawaa ~ iyy /' of air ' . 
* Morphosyntactic Issues In broken plurals , diminutives and deverbal nouns , the user may enter a morphologically sound , but morphosyntactically ill-formed word . We shall discuss this in more detail in section 4 . 4 To the above , one adds language-independent issues in spell checking such as the four Damerau transformations : omission  , insertion , transposition and substitution ( Damerau ,  1964) . 
2 A Morphographemic Model
This section presents a morphographemic model which handles error detection in nonlinear strings  . 
3 When indefinite , nouns and adjectives end in a phonetic In \] which is represented in the orthographic form by special diacritics  . 
4For other issues with respect to syntactic dependencies  , see ( Abduh ,  1990) . 
Subsection 2 . 1 presents the formalism used , and subsection 2 . 2 describes the model . 
2.1 The Formalism
In order to handle the nonlinear phenomenon of Arabic  , our model adopts the two-level formalism presented by  ( Pulman and Hepple ,  1993) , with the multitape extensions in ( Kiraz ,  1994) . Their for-realism appears in (2) . 

TwO-LEVEL FOR MALISM
LLC-LEX RLC
LSC-SURF-RSC where





RSC = left lexical context = lexical form = right lexical context = left surface context = surface form = right surface context The special symbol * is a wildcard matching any context  , with no length restrictions . The operator caters for obligatory rules . A lexical string maps to a surface string if \[ they can be partitioned into pairs of lexical -surface subsequences  , where each pair is licenced by a = ~ or ~ rule , and no partition violates a ? ~ rule . In the multitape version , lexical expressions ( i . e . LLC , LEX and RLC ) aren-tuple of regu-laxex pressions of the form ( xl , x2 ,   .   .   .   , xn ) : the/th expression refers to symbols on the ith tape  ; an ill slot is indicated by ~ . 5 Another extension is giving LLC the ability to contain ellipsis  ,   .   .   .   , which indicates the ( optional ) omission from LLC of tuples , provided that the tuples to the left of .   .   . are the first to appear on the left of LEx . 
In our morphographemic model , we add a similar formalism for expressing error rules  ( 3 )  . 

ERROR FOR MALISM
Err Surf = ~ Surf PLC-PRC where
PLC = partition left context ( has been done )
PRC = partition right context ( yet to be done ) 5 Our implementation interprets rules directly ; hence , we allow ~ . If the rules were to be compiled into automata , a genuine symbol , e . g . 0, must be used . For the compilation of our formalism into automata  , see ( Kiraz and Grimley-Evans ,  1995) . 

The error rules capture the correspondence b- tween the error surface and the correct surface  , given the surrounding partition into surface and lexical contexts  . They happily utilise the multitape format and integrate seamlessly into morphological naly -sis  . PLC and PRC above are the left and right contexts of both the lexical and  ( correct ) surface levels . 
Only the = ~ is used ( error is not obligatory).
2 . 2 The Model 2 . 2  . 1 F ind ing the er ror Morphological nalysis is first called with the assumption that the word is free of errors  . If this fails , analysis is attempted again with outhe'no error ' restriction  . The error rules are then considered when ordinary morphological rules fail  . If no error rules succeed , or lead to a successful partition of the word , analysis backtracks to try the error rules at successively earlier points in the word  . 
For purposes of simplicity and because oh the whole is it likely that words will contain no more than one error  ( Damerau , 1964; Pollock and Zamora ,  1983) , normal'no error ' analysis usually resumes if an error rule succeeds  . The exception occurs with a vowel shift error (?3 . 2 . 1) . If this error rule succeeds , an expectation of further shifted vowels is set up  , but no other error rule is allowed in the subsequent partitions  . For this reason rules are marked as to whether they can occur more than once  . 
2.2.2 Suggesting a correction
Once an error rule is selected , the corrected surface is substituted for the error surface  , and nor-mai analysis continues - at the same position  . The substituted surface may be in the form of a variable  , which is then ground by the normal analysis sequence of lexical matching over the lexicon tree  . 
In this way only lexical words a ~ e considered , as the variable letter can only he instantiated to letters branching out from the current position on the lexicon tree  . Normal prolog backtracking to explore alternative rules/lexical branches applies throughout  . 
3 Error Checking in Arabic
We demonstrate our model on the Arabic verbal stems shown in  ( 4 )   ( McCarthy ,  1981) . Verbs are classified according to their measure ( M ) : there are 15 trilateral measures and 4 quadrilateral ones . 
Moving horizontally across the table , one notices a change invo welmelody ( active a , passive ui ); everything else remains invariant . Moving vertically , a change in canonical pattern occurs ; everything else remains invariant . 
Subsection 3 . 1 presents a simple two-level grammar which describes the above data  . Subsection 3 . 2 presents error checking .

Exam-pies of pattern morphemes are: ( Cl VlC2 VlC3 ( M 1 )  , ClC2 VlnC3 v2c4 ( MQ3) . The root morphemes are ktb and db_rj , and the vocalism morphemes area ( active ) and ui ( passive )  . 
The following two-level grammar handles the above data  . Each lexical expression is a triple ; lexical expressions with one symbol assume e on the remaining positions  . 

GENERAL RULES * X-*::~
R0:,_X-**-(Pc,C,~)-*=~
RI : ._C -**-( P ~, ~, V ) *= ~
R2:,_V * where PcECl , c2, c3, c4,
P  ~ Evl , v2 , acter on the first lexical tape to surface , e . g . infixes , prefixes and suffixes . R1 states that any PEC l , c2 , c3 , c4 on the first ( pattern ) tape and C on the second ( root ) tape with no transition on the third ( vocalism ) tape corresponds to C on the surface tape ; this rules anctions consonants . Similarly , tL2 states that any PEV l ,   v2 on the pattern tape and V on vocalism tape with no transition on the roottape corresponds to V on the surface tape  ; this rules anctions vowels . 

BOUNDARY RULES
R3:(B , e,~)-+-*=~?-6-*
R4: ( B , * , *) (+ , + , + ) -* == ~ where B ~+ ( 6 ) gives two boundary rules : R3 is used for non-stem morphemes , e . g . prefixes and suffixes .   R4 applies to stem morphemes reading three boundary symbols simultaneously  ; this marks the end of a stem . Notice that LLC ensures that the right boundary rule is invoked at the right time  . 
Before embarking on the rest of the rules , an illustrated example seems in order . The derivation of/dhun rija/(MQ 5 , passive ) , from the three morphemes ClC2 VlnCsv2c4 , dhr j and ui , and the suffix a '3rd person ' is illustrated in ( 7 )  .

Notice the use of ellipsis to indicate that there can be tuples separating LEX and LLC  , as far as the tuples in LLC are the nearest ones to LEX  . R5 sanctions the spreading ( and gemination ) of consonants . R6 sanctions the spreading of the first vowel . Spreading examples appear in (9) .

R9A(vl , e ) p = ~ where A = ( V 1, 6, V) . -"( P c1, Cl , e ) and p = ( P c2, C2, e) . 
R 7 and R8 allow the optional deletion of short vowels in non-stem and stem morphemes  , respectively ; note that the lexical contexts make sure that long vowels are not deleted  .   R9 allows the optional deletion of a short vowel what is the cause of spreading  . For example the rules sanction both/katab/ ( M 1 , active ) and / kutib/(M1 , passive ) as interpretations of ( ktb ) as show in in ( 10 )  . 
3.2 Error Rules
Below are outlined error rules resulting from pecu -liarly Semitic problems  . Error rules can also be constructed in a similar veinto deal with typographical Damerau error  ( which also take care of the issue of ( lO )

Short vowels can legitimately be omitted from an orthographic representation-it is this fact which contributes to the problem of vowel shifts  . A vowel is considered shifted if the same vowel has been omitted earlier in the word  . 
The rule deletes the vowel from the surface . Hence in the next pass of ( normal ) analysis , the partition is analysed as a legitimate omission of the expected vowel  . This prepares for the next shifted vowel to be treated in exactly the same way as the first  . The expectation of this reapplieation is allowed for in reap = y  . 

E0: X = ~ e  where reap = y(\[om_stmv , e , (* , * , X )\] .   .   .   .  * 
El : X : : ~ e where reap = y\[*,*,(vl,~,X)\] . . . \[ om_sprv , 6, (*, *, 6)\] . . . . *  In the rules above , ' X ' is the shifted vowel . It is deleted from the surface . The partition contextual tuples consist of \[ RULE NAME  , SURF , LEX\] . The LEX element is a tuple itself of \[ PATTERN , ROOT , VOCALISM\] . In E0 the shifted vowel was analysed earlier as an omitted stem vowel  ( or e_stray )  , whereas in E1 it was analysed earlier as an omitted spread vowel  ( om_sprv )  . The surface/lexical restrictions in the contexts could be written out in more detail  , but both rules make use of the fact that those contexts are analysed by other partitions  , which check that they meet the conditions for an omitted stem vowel or omitted spread vowel  . 
For example , * ( dhruji ) will be interpreted as ( duhrij ) . The ' E0's on the rule number line indicate where the vowel shift rule was applied to replace an error surface vowel with  6  . The error surface vowels are written in italics .

One type of morphographemic error is that consonant substitution may not take place before appending a suffix  . For example/sama a P /' heaven '+ i y y ) ' relative adjective ' surfaces as ( samaa wiyy )  , where P-~w in the given context . A common mistake is to write it as * ( samma ~ iyy ) .

4 Broken Plurals , Diminutive and
Deverbal Nouns
This section deals with morphosyntactic errors which are independent of the two-level analysis  . The data described below was obtained from Daniel Ponsford  ( personal communication )  , based on ( Wehr ,  1971) . 
Recall that a Semitic stems consists of a root morpheme and a vocalism morpheme arranged according to a canonical pattern morpheme  . As each root does not occur in all vocalisms and patterns  , each lexical entry is associated with a feature structure which indicates inter alia the possible patterns and vocalisms for a particular root  . Consider the nominal data in (17) . 

BROKENPLURALS
Singular Plural Form skadi ~ kud ~ , * kidaa ~ kaa filkuffal , * kufalaa ~ , * kuffaalkaffilku falaa Psahm * Pashaam , suhuum , Pashum Patterns marked with * are morphologically plausible  , but do not occur lexically with the cited nouns . 
A common mistake is to choose the wrong pattern.
In such a case , the two-level model succeeds in finding two-level analyses of the word in question  , but fails when parsing the word morphosyntactically : at this stage  , the parser is passed a root , vo-calism and pattern whose feature structures do not unify  . 
Usually this feature-clash situation creates the problem of which constituent to give preference to  ( Langer ,  1990) . Here the vocalism indicates the inflection ( e . g . broken plural ) and the preferance of vocalism pattern for that type of inflection belongs to the root  . For example * ( kidaa ~ ) would be analysed as root kd ~ with a broken plural vocalism  . 
The pattern type of the vocalism clashes with the broken plural pattern that the root expects  . To correct , the morphological nalyser is executed in generation mode to generate the broken plural form of kd ~ in the normal way  . 
The same procedure can be applied on diminutive and deverbal nouns  . 
5 Conclusion
The model presented corrects errors resulting from combining nonconcatenative strings as well as more standard morphological or spelling errors  . It covers Semitic errors relating to vocalisation  , diacritics , phonetic syncopation and morphographemic idiosyncrasies  . Morphosyntactic issues of broken plurals , diminutives and deverbal nouns can be handled by a complementary correction strategy which also depends on morphological nalys is  . 
Other than the economic factor , an important advantage of combining morphological nalysis and error detection/correction is the way the lexical tree associated with the analysis can be used to determine correction possibilities  . The morphological analysis proceeds by selecting rules that hypothesis e lexical strings for a given surface string  . The rules are accepted/rejected by checking that the lexical string  ( s ) can extend along the lexical tree ( s ) from the current position ( s )  . Variables introduced by error rules into the surface string are then instantiated by associating surface with lexical  , and matching lexical strings to the lexicon tree ( s )  . The system is unable to consider correction characters that would be lexical impossibilities  .
