Abstract
Lexicalized reordering models play a crucial role in phrasebased translation systems . They are usually learned from the wordaligned bilingual corpus by examining the reordering relations of adjacent phrases . Instead of just checking whether there is one phrase adjacent to a given phrase , we argue that it is important to take the number of adjacent phrases into account for better estimations of reordering models . We propose to use a structure named reordering graph , which represents all phrase segmentations of a sentence pair , to learn lexicalized reordering models efficiently . Experimental results on the NIST ChineseEnglish test sets show that our approach significantly outperforms the baseline method.
1 Introduction
Phrase-based translation systems ( Koehn et al , 2003; Och and Ney , 2004) prove to be the state-of-the-art as they have delivered translation performance in recent machine translation evaluations.
While excelling at memorizing local translation and reordering , phrasebased systems have difficulties in modeling permutations among phrases . As a result , it is important to develop effective reordering models to capture such nonlocal reordering.
The early phrasebased paradigm ( Koehn et al , 2003) applies a simple distance-based distortion penalty to model the phrase movements . More recently , many researchers have presented lexicalized reordering models that take advantage of lexical information to predict reordering ( Tillmann , 2004; Xiong et al , 2006; Zens and Ney , 2006; Koehn et Figure 1: Occurrence of a swap with different numbers of adjacent bilingual phrases : only one phrase in ( a ) and three phrases in ( b ). Black squares denote word alignments and gray rectangles denote bilingual phrases . [ s,t ] indicates the target-side span of bilingual phrase bp and [ u,v ] represents the source-side span of bilingual phrase bp.
al ., 2007; Galley and Manning , 2008). These models are learned from a wordaligned corpus to predict three orientations of a phrase pair with respect to the previous bilingual phrase : monotone ( M ), swap ( S ), and discontinuous ( D ). Take the bilingual phrase bp in Figure 1(a ) for example . The word-based reordering model ( Koehn et al , 2007) analyzes the word alignments at positions ( s?1, u?1) and ( s ? 1, v + 1). The orientation of bp is set to D because the position ( s ? 1, v + 1) contains no word alignment . The phrasebased reordering model ( Tillmann , 2004) determines the presence of the adjacent bilingual phrase located in position ( s ? 1, v+1) and then treats the orientation of bp as S . Given no constraint on maximum phrase length , the hierarchical phrase reordering model ( Galley and Manning , 2008) also analyzes the adjacent bilingual phrases for bp and identifies its orientation as S.
However , given a bilingual phrase , the abovementioned models just consider the presence of an adjacent bilingual phrase rather than the number of adjacent bilingual phrases . See the examples in Fig-each bilingual phrase with a rectangle , where the upper and bottom numbers in the brackets represent the source and target spans of this bilingual phrase respectively . M = monotone ( solid lines ), S = swap ( dotted line ), and D = discontinuous ( segmented lines ). The bilingual phrases marked in the gray constitute a reordering example.
ure 1 for illustration . In Figure 1(a ), bp is in a swap order with only one bilingual phrase . In Figure 1(b ), bp swaps with three bilingual phrases . Lexicalized reordering models do not distinguish different numbers of adjacent phrase pairs , and just give bp the same count in the swap orientation.
In this paper , we propose a novel method to better estimate the reordering probabilities with the consideration of varying numbers of adjacent bilingual phrases . Our method uses reordering graphs to represent all phrase segmentations of parallel sentence pairs , and then gets the fractional counts of bilingual phrases for orientations from reordering graphs in an insideoutside fashion . Experimental results indicate that our method achieves significant improvements over the traditional lexicalized reordering model ( Koehn et al , 2007).
This paper is organized as follows : in Section 2, we first give a brief introduction to the traditional lexicalized reordering model . Then we introduce our method to estimate the reordering probabilities from reordering graphs . The experimental results are reported in Section 3. Finally , we end with a conclusion and future work in Section 4.
2 Estimation of Reordering Probabilities
Based on Reordering Graph
In this section , we first describe the traditional lexicalized reordering model , and then illustrate how to construct reordering graphs to estimate the reordering probabilities.
2.1 Lexicalized Reordering Model
Given a phrase pair bp = ( ei , fai ), where ai defines that the source phrase fai is aligned to the target phrase ei , the traditional lexicalized reordering model computes the reordering count of bp in the orientation o based on the word alignments of boundary words . Specifically , the model collects bilingual phrases and distinguishes their orientations with respect to the previous bilingual phrase into three categories : o = ? ?? ??
M ai ? ai?1 = 1
S ai ? ai?1 = ?1
D | ai ? ai?1| 6= 1 (1)
Using the relative-frequency approach , the reordering probability regarding bp is p(o|bp ) = Count(o , bp )? o ? Count(o ?, bp ) (2) 2.2 Reordering Graph For a parallel sentence pair , its reordering graph indicates all possible translation derivations consisting of the extracted bilingual phrases . To construct a reordering graph , we first extract bilingual phrases using the way of ( Och , 2003). Then , the adjacent side order . Some bilingual phrases , which have no adjacent bilingual phrases because of maximum length limitation , are linked to the nearest bilingual phrases in the target-side order.
Shown in Figure 2(b ), the reordering graph for the parallel sentence pair ( Figure 2(a )) can be represented as an undirected graph , where each rectangle corresponds to a phrase pair , each link is the orientation relationship between adjacent bilingual phrases , and two distinguished rectangles bs and be indicate the beginning and ending of the parallel sentence pair , respectively . With the reordering graph , we can obtain all reordering examples containing the given bilingual phrase . For example , the bilingual phrase ? zhengshi huitan , formal meetings ? ( see Figure 2(a )), corresponding to the rectangle labeled with the source span [6,7] and the target span [4,5], is in a monotone order with one previous phrase and in a discontinuous order with two subsequent phrases ( see Figure 2(b)).
2.3 Estimation of Reordering Probabilities We estimate the reordering probabilities from reordering graphs . Given a parallel sentence pair , there are many translation derivations corresponding to different paths in its reordering graph . Assuming all derivations have a uniform probability , the fractional counts of bilingual phrases for orientations can be calculated by utilizing an algorithm in the insideoutside fashion.
Given a phrase pair bp in the reordering graph , we denote the number of paths from bs to bp with ?( bp ). It can be computed in an iterative way ?( bp ) = ? bp ? ?( bp ?), where bp ? is one of the previous bilingual phrases of bp and ?( bs)=1. In a similar way , the number of paths from be to bp , notated as ?( bp ), is simply ?( bp ) = ? bp ?? ?( bp ??), where bp ?? is one of the subsequent bilingual phrases of bp and ?( be)=1. Here , we show the ? and ? values of all bilingual phrases of Figure 2 in Table 1. Especially , for the reordering example consisting of the bilingual phrases bp1=?jiang juxing , will hold ? and bp2=?zhengshi huitan , formal meetings ?, marked in the gray color in Figure 2, the ? and ? values can be calculated : ?( bp1) = 1, ?( bp2) = 1+1 = 2, ?( bs ) = 8+1 = 9.
Inspired by the parsing literature on pruning src span trg span ? ? [0, 0] [0, 0] 1 9 [1, 1] [1, 1] 1 8 [1, 7] [1, 7] 1 1 [4, 4] [2, 2] 1 1 [4, 5] [2, 3] 1 3 [4, 6] [2, 4] 1 1 [4, 7] [2, 5] 1 2 [2, 7] [2, 7] 1 1 [5, 5] [3, 3] 1 1 [6, 6] [4, 4] 2 1 [6, 7] [4, 5] 1 2 [7, 7] [5, 5] 3 1 [2, 2] [6, 6] 5 1 [2, 3] [6, 7] 2 1 [3, 3] [7, 7] 5 1 [8, 8] [8, 8] 9 1 Table 1: The ? and ? values of the bilingual phrases shown in Figure 2.
(Charniak and Johnson , 2005; Huang , 2008), the fractional count of ( o , bp ?, bp ) is
Count(o , bp ?, bp ) = ?( bp ?) ? ?( bp ) ?( bs ) (3) where the numerator indicates the number of paths containing the reordering example ( o , bp ?, bp ) and the denominator is the total number of paths in the reordering graph . Continuing with the reordering example described above , we obtain its fractional count using the formula (3): Count(M , bp1, bp2) = (1? 2)/9 = 2/9.
Then , the fractional count of bp in the orientation o is calculated as described below:
Count(o , bp ) = ? bp?
Count(o , bp ?, bp ) (4)
For example , we compute the fractional count of bp2 in the monotone orientation by the formula (4):
Count(M , bp2) = 2/9.
As described in the lexicalized reordering model ( Section 2.1), we apply the formula (2) to calculate the final reordering probabilities.
3 Experiments
We conduct experiments to investigate the effectiveness of our method on the msd-fe reordering model and the msd-bidirectional-fe reordering model . These two models are widely applied in fe reordering model has three features , which represent the probabilities of bilingual phrases in three orientations : monotone , swap , or discontinuous . If a msd-bidirectional-fe model is used , then the number of features doubles : one for each direction.
3.1 Experiment Setup
Two different sizes of training corpora are used in our experiments : one is a small-scale corpus that comes from FBIS corpus consisting of 239K bilingual sentence pairs , the other is a largescale corpus that includes 1.55M bilingual sentence pairs from LDC . The 2002 NIST MT evaluation test data is used as the development set and the 2003, 2004, 2005 NIST MT test data are the test sets . We choose the MOSES1 ( Koehn et al , 2007) as the experimental decoder . GIZA ++ ( Och and Ney , 2003) and the heuristics ? grow-diag-final-and ? are used to generate a wordaligned corpus , where we extract bilingual phrases with maximum length 7. We use SRILM Toolkits ( Stolcke , 2002) to train a 4gram language model on the Xinhua portion of Gigaword corpus.
In exception to the reordering probabilities , we use the same features in the comparative experiments . During decoding , we set ttable-limit = 20, stack = 100, and perform minimum-error-rate training ( Och , 2003) to tune various feature weights . The translation quality is evaluated by case-insensitive BLEU4 metric ( Papineni et al , 2002). Finally , we conduct paired bootstrap sampling ( Koehn , 2004) to test the significance in BLEU scores differences.
3.2 Experimental Results
Table 2 shows the results of experiments with the small training corpus . For the msd-fe model , the BLEU scores by our method are 30.51 32.78 and 29.50, achieving absolute improvements of 0.89, 0.66 and 0.62 on the three test sets , respectively . For the msd-bidirectional-fe model , our method obtains BLEU scores of 30.49 32.73 and 29.24, with absolute improvements of 1.11, 0.73 and 0.60 over the baseline method.
1The phrasebased lexical reordering model ( Tillmann , 2004) is also closely related to our model . However , due to the limit of time and space , we only use Moses-style reordering model ( Koehn et al , 2007) as our baseline.

Table 3 shows the results of experiments with the large training corpus . In the experiments of the msd-fe model , in exception to the MT05 test set , our method is superior to the baseline method.
The BLEU scores by our method are 32.44, 33.24 and 31.64, which obtain 0.86, 0.85 and 0.15 gains on three test set , respectively . For the msd-bidirectional-fe model , the BLEU scores produced by our approach are 33.29, 34.49 and 32.79 on the three test sets , with 0.86, 1.42 and 1.1 points higher than the baseline method , respectively.
4 Conclusion and Future Work
In this paper , we propose a method to improve the reordering model by considering the effect of the number of adjacent bilingual phrases on the reordering probabilities estimation . Experimental results on NIST Chinese-to-English tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.
Our method is also general to other lexicalized reordering models . We plan to apply our method to the complex lexicalized reordering models , for example , the hierarchical reordering model ( Galley and Manning , 2008) and the MEBTG reordering model ( Xiong et al , 2006). In addition , how to further improve the reordering model by distinguishing the derivations with different probabilities will become another study emphasis in further research.
