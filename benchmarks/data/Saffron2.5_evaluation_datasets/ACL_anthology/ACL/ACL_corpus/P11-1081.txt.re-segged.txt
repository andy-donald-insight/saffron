Abstract
We present an ILP-based model of zero anaphora detection and resolution that builds on the joint determination of anaphoricity and coreference model proposed by Denis and Baldridge (2007), but revises it and extends it into a three-way ILP problem also incorporating subject detection . We show that this new model outperforms several baselines and competing models , as well as a direct translation of the Denis / Baldridge model , for both Italian and Japanese zero anaphora . We incorporate our model in complete anaphoric resolvers for both Italian and Japanese , showing that our approach leads to improved performance also when not used in isolation , provided that separate classifiers are used for zeros and for explicitly realized anaphors.
1 Introduction
In socalled ? prodrop ? languages such as Japanese and many romance languages including Italian , phonetic realization is not required for anaphoric references in contexts in which in English noncontrastive pronouns are used : e.g ., the subjects of Italian and Japanese translations of buy in (1b ) and (1c ) are not explicitly realized . We call these non-realized mandatory arguments zero anaphors.
(1) a . [ EN ] [ John ] i went to visit some friends . On the way , [ he ] i bought some wine.
b . [ IT ] [ Giovanni ] i ando ` a far visita a degli amici . Per via , ? i compro ` del vino.

The felicitousness of zero anaphoric reference depends on the referred entity being sufficiently salient , hence this type of data?particularly in Japanese and Italian?played a key role in early work in coreference resolution , e.g ., in the development of Centering ( Kameyama , 1985; Walker et al ., 1994; Di Eugenio , 1998). This research highlighted both commonalities and differences between the phenomenon in such languages . Zero anaphora resolution has remained a very active area of study for researchers working on Japanese , because of the prevalence of zeros in such languages1 ( Seki et al , 2002; Isozaki and Hirao , 2003; Iida et al , 2007a ; Taira et al , 2008; Imamura et al , 2009; Sasano et al ., 2009; Taira et al , 2010). But now the availability of corpora annotated to study anaphora , including zero anaphora , in languages such as Italian ( e.g ., Rodriguez et al (2010)), and their use in competitions such as SEMEVAL 2010 Task 1 on Multilingual Coreference ( Recasens et al , 2010), is leading to a renewed interest in zero anaphora resolution , particularly at the light of the mediocre results obtained on zero anaphors by most systems participating in SEMEVAL.
Resolving zero anaphora requires the simultaneous decision that one of the arguments of a verb is phonetically unrealized ( and which argument exactly?in this paper , we will only be concerned with subject zeros as these are the only type to occur in Italian ) and that a particular entity is its antecedent . It is therefore natural to view zero anaphora resolution as a joint inference 1As shown in Table 1, 64.3% of anaphors in the NAIST Text
Corpus of Anaphora are zeros.
804 task , for which Integer Linear Programming ( ILP )? introduced to NLP by Roth and Yih (2004) and successfully applied by Denis and Baldridge (2007) to the task of jointly inferring anaphoricity and determining the antecedent?would be appropriate.
In this work we developed , starting from the ILP system proposed by Denis and Baldridge , an ILP approach to zero anaphora detection and resolution that integrates ( revised ) versions of Denis and Baldridge?s constraints with additional constraints between the values of three distinct classifiers , one of which is a novel one for subject prediction . We demonstrate that treating zero anaphora resolution as a three-way inference problem is successful for both Italian and Japanese . We integrate the zero anaphora resolver with a coreference resolver and demonstrate that the approach leads to improved results for both Italian and Japanese.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows.
Section 2 briefly summarizes the approach proposed by Denis and Baldridge (2007). We next present our new ILP formulation in Section 3. In Section 4 we show the experimental results with zero anaphora only . In Section 5 we discuss experiments testing that adding our zero anaphora detector and resolver to a full coreference resolver would result in overall increase in performance . We conclude and discuss future work in Section 7.
2 Using ILP for joint anaphoricity and coreference determination Integer Linear Programming ( ILP ) is a method for constraint-based inference aimed at finding the values for a set of variables that maximize a ( linear ) objective function while satisfying a number of constraints . Roth and Yih (2004) advocated ILP as a general solution for a number of NLP tasks that require combining multiple classifiers and which the traditional pipeline architecture is not appropriate , such as entity disambiguation and relation extraction.
Denis and Baldridge (2007) defined the following object function for the joint anaphoricity and coreference determination problem.
min ? ? i,j??P cC ? i,j ? ? x ? i,j ? + c?C ? i,j ? ? (1 ? x ? i,j ? ) + ? j?M cA j ? y j + c?A j ? (1 ? y j ) (2) subject to x ? i,j ? ? {0, 1} ?? i , j ? ? P y j ? {0, 1} ? j ? M M stands for the set of mentions in the document , and P the set of possible coreference links over these mentions . x ? i,j ? is an indicator variable that is set to 1 if mentions i and j are coreferent , and 0 otherwise.
y j is an indicator variable that is set to 1 if mention j is anaphoric , and 0 otherwise . The costs cC ? i,j ? = ? log(P ( COREF|i , j )) are ( logs of ) probabilities produced by an antecedent identification classifier with ? log , whereas cA j = ? log(P ( ANAPH|j )), are the probabilities produced by an anaphoricity determination classifier with ? log . In the Denis & Baldridge model , the search for a solution to antecedent identification and anaphoricity determination is guided by the following three constraints.
Resolve only anaphors : if a pair of mentions ? i , j ? is coreferent ( x ? i,j ? = 1), then mention j must be anaphoric ( y j = 1).
x ? i,j ? ? y j ?? i , j ? ? P (3)
Resolve anaphors : if a mention is anaphoric ( y j = 1), it must be coreferent with at least one antecedent.
y j ? ? i?M j x ? i,j ? ? j ? M (4)
Do not resolve non-anaphors : if a mention is nonanaphoric ( y j = 0), it should have no antecedents.
y j ? j | ? i?M j x ? i,j ? ? j ? M (5) 3 An ILP-based account of zero anaphora detection and resolution In the corpora used in our experiments , zero anaphora is annotated using as markable the first verbal form ( not necessarily the head ) following the position where the argument would have been realized , as in the following example.
805 (6) [ Pahor ] i e ` nato a Trieste , allora porto principale dell?Impero Austro-Ungarico.
A sette anni [ vide ] i l?incendio del Narodni dom , The proposal of Denis and Baldridge (2007) can be easily turned into a proposal for the task of detecting and resolving zero anaphora in this type of data by reinterpreting the indicator variables as follows : ? y j is 1 if markable j ( a verbal form ) initiates a verbal complex whose subject is unrealized , 0 otherwise ; ? x ? i,j ? is 1 if the empty mention realizing the subject argument of markable j and markable i are mentions of the same entity , 0 otherwise.
There are however a number of ways in which this direct adaptation can be modified and extended . We discuss them in turn.
3.1 Best First
In the context of zero anaphora resolution , the ? Do not resolve non-anaphors ? constraint (5) is too weak , as it allows the redundant choice of more than one candidate antecedent . We developed therefore the following alternative , that blocks selection of more than one antecedent.
Best First ( BF ): y j ? ? i?M j x ? i,j ? ? j ? M (7) 3.2 A subject detection model The greatest difficulty in zero anaphora resolution in comparison to , say , pronoun resolution , is zero anaphora detection . Simply relying for this on the parser is not enough : most dependency parsers are not very accurate at identifying cases in which the verb does not have a subject on syntactic grounds only . Again , it seems reasonable to suppose this is because zero anaphora detection requires a combination of syntactic information and information about the current context . Within the ILP framework , this hypothesis can be implemented by turning the zero anaphora resolution optimization problem into one with three indicator variables , with the objective function in (8). The third variable , z j , encodes the information provided by the parser : it is 1 with cost cS j = ? log(P ( SUBJ | j )) if the parser thinks that verb j has an explicit subject with probability P ( SUBJ | j ), otherwise it is 0.
min ? ? i,j??P cC ? i,j ? ? x ? i,j ? + c?C ? i,j ? ? (1 ? x ? i,j ? ) + ? j?M cA j ? y j + c?A j ? (1 ? y j ) + ? j?M cS j ? z j + c?S j ? (1 ? z j ) (8) subject to x ? i,j ? ? {0, 1} ?? i , j ? ? P y j ? {0, 1} ? j ? M z j ? {0, 1} ? j ? M The crucial fact about the relation between z j and y j is that a verb has either a syntactically realized NP or a zero pronoun as a subject , but not both . This is encoded by the following constraint.
Resolve only nonsubjects : if a predicate j syntactically depends on a subject ( z j = 1), then the predicate j should have no antecedents of its subject zero pronoun.
y j + z j ? 1 ? j ? M (9) 4 Experiment 1: zero anaphora resolution In a first round of experiments , we evaluated the performance of the model proposed in Section 3 on zero anaphora only ( i.e ., not attempting to resolve other types of anaphoric expressions).
4.1 Data sets
We use the two data sets summarized in Table 1.
The table shows that NP anaphora occurs more frequently than zero-anaphora in Italian , whereas in Japanese the frequency of anaphoric zero-anaphors2 is almost double the frequency of the remaining anaphoric expressions.
Italian For Italian coreference , we used the annotated data set presented in Rodriguez et al (2010) and developed for the Semeval 2010 task ? Coreference Resolution in Multiple Languages ? ( Recasens et al , 2010), where both zero-anaphora and NP 2In Japanese , like in Italian , zero anaphors are often used non-anaphorically , to refer to situationally introduced entities , as in I went to John?s office , but they told me that he had left.

Table 1: Italian and Japanese Data Sets coreference are annotated . This dataset consists of articles from Italian Wikipedia , tokenized , POS-tagged and morphologically analyzed using TextPro , a freely available Italian pipeline ( Pianta et al , 2008). We parsed the corpus using the Italian version of the DESR dependency parser ( Attardi et al , 2007).
In Italian , zero pronouns may only occur as omitted subjects of verbs . Therefore , in the task of zero-anaphora resolution all verbs appearing in a text are considered candidates for zero pronouns , and all gold mentions or system mentions preceding a candidate zero pronoun are considered as candidate antecedents . ( In contrast , in the experiments on coreference resolution discussed in the following section , all mentions are considered as both candidate anaphors and candidate antecedents . To compare the results with gold mentions and with system detected mentions , we carried out an evaluation using the mentions automatically detected by the Italian version of the BART system ( I-BART ) ( Poesio et al , 2010), which is freely downloadable.3 Japanese For Japanese coreference we used the NAIST Text Corpus ( Iida et al , 2007b ) version 1.4?, which contains the annotated data about NP coreference and zero-anaphoric relations . We also used the Kyoto University Text Corpus4 that provides dependency relations information for the same articles as the NAIST Text Corpus . In addition , we also used a Japanese named entity tagger , CaboCha5 for automatically tagging named entity labels . In the NAIST Text Corpus mention boundaries are not annotated , only the heads . Thus , we considered 3http://www.bart-coref.org / 4http://www-lab25.kuee.kyoto-u.ac.jp/nl-resource/corpus.html 5http://chasen.org?taku/software/cabocha / as pseudo-mentions all bunsetsu chunks ( i.e . base phrases in Japanese ) whose head part-of-speech was automatically tagged by the Japanese morphological analyser Chasen6 as either ? noun ? or ? unknown word ? according to the NAIST-jdic dictionary.7 For evaluation , articles published from January 1st to January 11th and the editorials from January to August were used for training and articles dated January 14th to 17th and editorials dated October to December are used for testing as done by Taira et al (2008) and Imamura et al (2009). Furthermore , in the experiments we only considered subject zero pronouns for a fair comparison to Italian zero-anaphora.
4.2 Models
In these first experiments we compared the three ILP-based models discussed in Section 3: the direct reimplementation of the Denis and Baldridge proposal ( i.e ., using the same constrains ), a version replacing Do-Not-Resolve-Not-Anaphors with BestFirst , and a version with Subject Detection as well.
As discussed by Iida et al (2007a ) and Imamura et al (2009), useful features in intrasentential zero-anaphora are different from ones in intersentential zero-anaphora because in the former problem syntactic information between a zero pronoun and its candidate antecedent is essential , while the latter needs to capture the significance of saliency based on Centering Theory ( Grosz et al , 1995).
To directly reflect this difference , we created two antecedent identification models ; one for intrasentential zero-anaphora , induced using the training instances which a zero pronoun and its candidate antecedent appear in the same sentences , the other for 6http://chasen-legacy.sourceforge.jp / 7http://sourceforge.jp/projects/naist-jdic / training instances.
To estimate the feature weights of each classifier , we used MEGAM8, an implementation of the Maximum Entropy model , with default parameter settings . The ILP-based models were compared with the following baselines.
PAIRWISE : as in the work by Soon et al (2001), antecedent identification and anaphoricity determination are simultaneously executed by a single classifier.
DS-CASCADE : the model first filters out nonanaphoric candidate anaphors using an anaphoricity determination model , then selects an antecedent from a set of candidate antecedents of anaphoric candidate anaphors using an antecedent identification model.
4.3 Features
The feature sets for antecedent identification and anaphoricity determination are briefly summarized in Table 2 and Table 3, respectively . The agreement features such as NUM AGREE and GEN AGREE are automatically derived using TextPro . Such agreement features are not available in Japanese because Japanese words do not contain such information.
4.4 Creating subject detection models
To create a subject detection model for Italian , we used the TUT corpus9 ( Bosco et al , 2010), which contains manually annotated dependency relations and their labels , consisting of 80,878 tokens in CoNLL format . We induced an maximum entropy classifier by using as items all arcs of dependency relations , each of which is used as a positive instance if its label is subject ; otherwise it is used as a negative instance.
To train the Japanese subject detection model we used 1,753 articles contained both in the NAIST Text Corpus and the Kyoto University Text Corpus.
By merging these two corpora , we can obtain the annotated data including which dependency arc is sub-ject10. To create the training instances , any pair of a predicate and its dependent are extracted , each of 8http://www.cs.utah.edu/?hal/megam / 9http://www.di.unito.it/?tutreeb / 10Note that Iida et al (2007b ) referred to this relation as ? nominative?.

PATH * dependency labels ( functional words ) of words intervening between a ZERO and the sentence head The features marked with ?*? used only in Japanese.
Table 3: Features for anaphoricity determination which is judged as positive if its relation is subject ; as negative otherwise.
As features for Italian , we used lemmas , PoS tag of a predicate and its dependents as well as their morphological information ( i.e . gender and number ) automatically computed by TextPro ( Pianta et al ., 2008). For Japanese , the head lemmas of predicate and dependent chunks as well as the functional words involved with these two chunks were used as features . One case specially treated is when a dependent is placed as an adnominal constituent of a predicate , as in this case relation estimation of dependency arcs is difficult . In such case we instead use the features shown in Table 2 for accurate estimation.
4.5 Results with zero anaphora only
In zero anaphora resolution , we need to find all predicates that have anaphoric unrealized subjects ( i.e.
zero pronouns which have an antecedent in a text ), and then identify an antecedent for each such argument.
The Italian and Japanese test data sets contain 4,065 and 25,467 verbal predicates respectively . The performance of each model at zero-anaphora detection and resolution is shown in Table 4, using recall HEAD LEMMA characters of the head lemma in NP.

Table 4: Results on zero pronouns / precision / F over link detection as a metric ( model theoretic metrics do not apply for this task as only subsets of coreference chains are considered ). As can be seen from Table 4, the ILP version with Do-Not-Resolve-Non-Anaphors performs no better than the baselines for either languages , but in both languages replacing that constraint with BestFirst results in a performance above the baselines ; adding Subject Detection results in further improvement for both languages . Notice also that the performance of the models on Italian is quite a bit higher than for Japanese although the dataset is much smaller , possibly meaning that the task is easier in Italian.
5 Experiment 2: coreference resolution for all anaphors In a second series of experiments we evaluated the performance of our models together with a full coreference system resolving all anaphors , not just zeros.
5.1 Separating vs combining classifiers
Different types of nominal expressions display very different anaphoric behavior : e.g ., pronoun resolution involves very different types of information from nominal expression resolution , depending more on syntactic information and on the local context and less on commonsense knowledge . But the most common approach to coreference resolu-is to use a single classifier to identify antecedents of all anaphoric expressions , relying on the ability of the machine learning algorithm to learn these differences . These models , however , often fail to capture the differences in anaphoric behavior between different types of expressions?one of the reasons being that the amount of training instances is often too small to learn such differences.11 Using different models would appear to be key in the case of zero-anaphora resolution , which differs even more from the rest of anaphora resolution , e.g ., in being particularly sensitive to local salience , as amply discussed in the literature on Centering discussed earlier.
To test the hypothesis that using what we will call separated models for zero anaphora and everything else would work better than combined models induced from all the learning instances , we manually split the training instances in terms of these two anaphora types and then created two classifiers for antecedent identification : one for zero-anaphora , the other for NP-anaphora , separately induced from the corresponding training instances . Likewise , anaphoricity determination models were separately induced with regards to these two anaphora types.
5.2 Results with all anaphors
In Table 5 and Table 6 we show the ( MUC scorer ) results obtained by adding the zero anaphoric resolution models proposed in this paper to both a combined and a separated classifier . For the separated classifier , we use the ILP+BF model for explicitly realized NPs , and different ILP models for zeros.
The results show that the separated classifier works systematically better than a combined classifier . For both Italian and Japanese the ILP+BF+SUBJ model works clearly better than the baselines , whereas simply applying the original Denis and Baldridge model unchanged to this case we obtain worse results than the baselines . For Italian we could also compare our results with those obtained on the same dataset by one of the two systems that participated to the Italian section of SEMEVAL , I-BART . I-BART?s results are clearly better than those with both baselines , but also clearly in-11E.g ., the entire MUC6 corpus contains a grand total of 3 reflexive pronouns.

6 Related work
We are not aware of any previous machine learning model for zero anaphora in Italian , but there has been quite a lot of work on Japanese zero-anaphora ( Iida et al , 2007a ; Taira et al , 2008; Imamura et al , 2009; Taira et al , 2010; Sasano et al , 2009). In work such as Taira et al (2008) and Imamura et al (2009), zero-anaphora resolution is considered as a subtask of predicate argument structure analysis , taking the NAIST text corpus as a target data set . Taira et al (2008) and Taira et al (2010) applied decision lists and transformationbased learning respectively in order to manually analyze which clues are important for each argument assignment.
Imamura et al (2009) also tackled to the same problem setting by applying a pairwise classifier for each argument . In their approach , a ? null ? argument is explicitly added into the set of candidate argument to learn the situation where an argument of a predicate is ? exophoric ?. They reported their model achieved better performance than the work by Taira et al (2008).
Iida et al (2007a ) also used the NAIST text corpus . They adopted the BACT learning algorithm ( Kudo and Matsumoto , 2004) to effectively learn subtrees useful for both antecedent identification and zero pronoun detection . Their model drastically outperformed a simple pairwise model , but it is still performed as a cascaded process .

Table 5: Results for overall coreference : Italian ( MUC score ) their model into the ILP formulation proposed here looks like a promising further extension.
Sasano et al (2009) obtained interesting experimental results about the relationship between zero-anaphora resolution and the scale of automatically acquired case frames . In their work , their case frames were acquired from a very large corpus consisting of 100 billion words . They also proposed a probabilistic model to Japanese zero-anaphora in which an argument assignment score is estimated based on the automatically acquired case frames . They concluded that case frames acquired from larger corpora lead to better f - score on zero-anaphora resolution.
In contrast to these approaches in Japanese , the participants to Semeval 2010 task 1 ( especially the Italian coreference task ) simply solved the problems using one coreference classifier , not distinguishing zero-anaphora from the other types of anaphora ( Kobdani and Schu?tze , 2010; Poesio et al , 2010). On the other hand , our approach shows separating problems contributes to improving performance in Italian zero-anaphora . Although we used gold mentions in our evaluations , mention detection is also essential . As a next step , we also need to take into account ways of incorporating a mention detection model into the ILP formulation.
7 Conclusion
In this paper , we developed a new ILP-based model of zero anaphora detection and resolution that extends the coreference resolution model proposed by Denis and Baldridge (2007) by introducing modified constraints and a subject detection model . We evaluated this model both individually and as part of the overall coreference task for both Italian and Japanese zero anaphora , obtaining clear improvements in performance.
One avenue for future research is motivated by the observation that whereas introducing the subject detection model and the bestfirst constraint results in higher precision maintaining the recall compared to the baselines , that precision is still low . One of the major source of the errors is that zero pronouns are frequently used in Italian and Japanese in contexts in which in English as socalled generic they would be used : ? I walked into the hotel and ( they ) said ..?. In such case , the zero pronoun detection model is often incorrect . We are considering adding a generic they detection component.
We also intend to experiment with introducing more sophisticated antecedent identification models in the ILP framework . In this paper , we used a very basic pairwise classifier ; however Yang et al (2008) and Iida et al (2003) showed that the relative comparison of two candidate antecedents leads to obtaining better accuracy than the pairwise model . However , these approaches do not output absolute probabilities , but relative significance between two candidates , and therefore cannot be directly integrated with the ILP-framework . We plan to examine ways of appropriately estimating an absolute score from a set of relative scores for further refinement.
Finally , we would like to test our model with English constructions which closely resemble zero anaphora . One example were studied in the Semeval 2010 ? Linking Events and their Participants in Discourse ? task , which provides data about null instan-arrived ? goal at 8pm .?. ( Unfortunately the dataset available for SEMEVAL was very small .) Another interesting area of application of these techniques would be VP ellipsis.
