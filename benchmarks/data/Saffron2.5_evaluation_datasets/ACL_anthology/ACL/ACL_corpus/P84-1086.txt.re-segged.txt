I . INTRODUCTION
Linguistic knowledge usable for machine translation is always imperfect  . We cannot be free from the uncertainty of knowledge we have for machine translation  . Especially at the transfer stage of machine translation  , the selection of target language expression is rather subjective and optional  . 
Therefore the linguistic contents of machine translation system always fluctuate  , and make gradual progress . The system should be designed to allow such constant change and improvements  . This paper explains the details of the transfer and generation stages of Japanese-to-English system of the machine translation project by the Japanese Government  , with the emphasis on the ideas to deal with the incompleteness of linguistic knowledge for machine translation  . 
2 . DESIGN STRATEGIES 2 . 1 Annotated Dependency Structure The intermediate representation we adopted as the result of analysis in our machine translation is the annotated dependency structure  . Each node has arbitrary number of features as shown in Fig  . i . 
This makes it possible to access the constituents by more than one linguistic cues  . This representation is therefore powerful and flexible for the sophisticated grammatical and semantic checking  , especially when the completeness of semantic analysis is not assured and trial-and-error improvements are required at the transfer and generation stages  . 
2.2 Multiple L ~ aver Grammar
We have three conceptual levels for grammar rules.
lowest level : default grammar which guarantees the output of the translation process  . The quality of the translation is not assured . Rules of this level apply to those inputs for which no higher layer grammar rules are applicable  . 
kernel level : main grammar which chooses and generates target language structure according to semantic relations among constituents which are determined in the analysis stage  . 
topmost level : heuristic grammar which attempts to get elegant translation for the input  . Each rule bears heuristic nature in the sense that it is word specific and it is applicable only to some restricted classes of inputs  . 
2.3 Multiple Relation Structure
In principle , we use deep case dependency structure as a semantic representation  . Theoretically we can assign a unique case dependency structure to each input sentence  . In practice , however , analysis phase may fail or may assign a wrong structure  . Therefore we use as an intermediate representation a structure which makes it possible to annotate multiple possibilities as well as multiple level representation  . An example is shown in Fig .  2 . Properties at a node is represented as a vector , so that this complex dependency structure is flexible in the sense that different interpretation rules can be applied to the structure  . 
2.4 Lexicon Driven Feature
Besides the transfer and generation rules which involve semantic checking functions  , the grammar allows the reference to a lexical item in the dictionary  . A lexical item contains its special grammatical usages and idiomatic expressions  . 
During the transfer and generation stages , the ~ e rules are activated with the highest priority  . 
This feature makes the system very flexible for dealing with exceptional cases  . The improvement of translation quality can be achieved progressively by adding linguistic information and word usages in the dictionary entries  . 
2.5 Format-Oriented Description of Dictionary

The quality of a machine translation system heavily depends on the quality of the dictionary  . 
In order to build a machine translation dictionary  , we collaborate with expert translators . We develop-ed a format-oriented language to allow computer-naive human translators to encode their expertise without any conscious effort on programming  . 
Although the format-oriented language we developed lacks full expressive power for highly sophistic at-ed linguistic phenomena  , it can cover most of the common lexical information translators may want to describe  . The formatted description is automatically converted into statements in GRADE  , a programming language developed by the Mu - Project  . We prepared a manual according to which a man can fill in the dictionary format with linguistic data of items  . The manual guarantees a certain level of quality of the dictionary  , which is important when many people have to work in parallel  .

3. ORGANIZATION OFG RAMM ARRULES FOR TRANS FER
ANDGENERATION STAGES 3 . 1 Heurist ic Rule First Grammar rules are organized along the principle that " if better rule exists then the system uses it  ; otherwise the system attempts to use a standard rule : if it fails  , the system will use a default rule . " The grammar rule involves a number of stages for applying heuristic rules  . Fig .   3 shows a processing flow for the transfer and generation stages  . 
Heuristic rules are word specific . GRADE makes it possible to define word specific rules  . Such rules can be invoked in many ways . For example , we can associate a word selection rule for an ordinary verb in a dictionary entry for a noun  , as shown in

Some heuristic rules are activated just after the standard analysis of a 
Japanese sentence is finish-ed , to obtain a more neutral ( or target language oriente ~ analyzed structure . We call such invocation the pre-transfer loop . Semantic and pragmatic interpretation are done in the pre-transfer loop  . The more heuristic rules are applied in this loop  , the better result will be obtained . Figs . 5 and 6 show some examples . 
3.3 Word Selection in
Target Language by
Using Semantic Markers
Word selection in the target language is a big problem in machine translation  . There are varieties of choices of translation for a word in the source language  . Main principles adopted in our system are , ( i ) Area restriction by using field code , such as electrical Engineering , nuclear science , medicine , and so on . 
(2 ) Semantic code attached to a word in the analysis phase is used for the selection of a proper target language word or a phrase  . 
(3 ) Sentential structure of the vicinity of a word to be translated is sometimes effective for the determination of a proper word or a phrase in the target language  . 
Table i shows examples of a part of the verb transfer dictionary  . Selection of English verb is done by the semantic categories of nouns related to the verb  . 
The number i attached to verbs like form-l , produce-2 is the ith usage of the verb . When the semantic information of nouns is not available  , the column indicated by ~ is applied to

In most cases , we can use a fixed format for describing a translation rule for lexical items  . We developed a number of dictionary formats specially designed for the ease of dictionary input by computer-naive expert translators  . 
The expressive power of format-oriented description is  , however , insufficient for a number of common verbs such as  "~ ~ "   ( make , do , perform .   .   .   . ) and " ~ ~" ( become , consist of , provide, . . . ) etc . In such cases , we can encode transfer rules directly by GRADE . An example is shown in Fig .  7 . Varieties of usages are to be listed up with their corresponding English sentential structures and semantic conditions  . 
3.4 Post-Transfer Rules
The transfer stage bridges the gap between Japanese and English expressions  . 
There are still many odd structures after this stage  , and we have to adjust furthermore the English internal representation into more natural ones  . We call this part as post-transfer loop . 
An example is given in Fig . 8, where a
Japanese factitive verb is first transferred to English " make "  , and then a structural change is made to eliminate it  , and to have a more direct expression . 
4. GENERATION PROCESS 4.1 Translation of Japanese

Postpositions in Japanese generally express the case slots for verbs  . A postposition , however , has different usages , and the determination of English prepositions for each postposition is quite difficult  . It also depends on the verb which governs the noun phrase having that postposition  . 
Table 2 illustrates a part of a default table for determining deep and surface case labels when no higher level rule applies  . This sort of tables are defined for all case combination  . In this way , we confirm at least one translation to be assigned to an input  . A particular usage of preposition for a particular English verb is written in the lexical entry of the verb  .

Grobal sential structures of Japanese and English are quite different  , and correspondingly the internal structure of a Japanese sentence is not the same as that of English  . Fundamental difference from Japanese internal representation to that of English is absorbed at the  ( pre- , post -) transfer stages . But at the stage of English generation , some structural transformations are still required in such oases as  ( a ) embedded sentential structure , ( b ) complex sentential structure . 
We classified four kinds of embedded sential structures  . 
( i ) a case slot of an embedded sentence is vacant , and the noun modified by the embedded sentence comes to fill the slot  . 
(~ ) The form like " NI ~ " V ~ N2 " m " ( N2 ~ NI~'V ) N2" . In this case the noun NI must have the semantic properties like parts  , attributes , and action . 
(~i~ ) The third and the fourth classes are particular embedded expressions in Japanese  , which have the connecting expressions like "~" ( in the case of )  , " ~9~" ( in the way that , " g  ~ , P " ( in that ) , and so on . 
An example of the structural transformation is shown in Fig  .  9 . The relative clause " vhy . . . " is generated after the structural transformation . 
Connection of two sentences in the compound and complex sentences is done according to Table  3  . An example is given in Fig . i0 . 
4 . 3 The Process of Sentence Generation in English After the transfer is done from the Japanese deep dependency structure to the English one  , conversion is done to a phrase structure tree with all the surface words attached to the tree  . The processes explained in 4 . 1 and 4 . 2 are involved at this generation stage . The conversion is perform-ed topdown from the root node of the dependency tree to the leaf  . Therefore when a governing verb demands a noun phrase expression or a to-infinitive expression to its dependent phrase  , the structural change of the phrase must be performed  .

Fig . i0 . Structural transformation of an embedded sentence . 
transformation are often required due to the difference of expressions in Japanese and English  . This process goes down from the root node to all the leaf nodes  . 
After this process of phrase structure generation , some sentential transformations are performed such as follows  . 
( i ) When an agent is absent , passive transformation is applied . 
( ii ) When the agent and object are both missing , the predicative verb is nominalized and placed as the subject  , and such verb phrases as " is made " , and " is performed " are supplemented . 
( iii ) When a subject phrase is a big tree , the anticipatory subject " it " is introduced . 
( iv ) Pronominalization of the same subject nouns is done in compound and complex sentences  . 
( v ) Duplication of a head noun in the conjunctive noun phrase is eliminated  , such as , " uniform component and nonuniform component "> " uniform and nonuniform components "  . 
( vi ) Others.
Another big structural transformation required comes from the essential difference between DO -language  ( English ) and BE-language ( Japanese )  . In English the case slots such as tools , cause/reason , and some others come to the subject position very often  , while in Japanese such expressions are never used  . The transformation of this kind is incorporated in the generation grannnar such as shown in Fig  . ii , and produces more English-like expressions . 
This stylistic transformation part is still very primitive  . We have to accumulate much more linguistic knowledge and lexical data to have more satisfiable English expressions  .

5. SUMMARY
This paper described a number of strategies we employed in the transfer and generation stages of our Musy stem to make the system both powerful and fault-tolerant  . As is mentioned above , our system has many advantages such as the flexibility of the generation process  , the utilization of strong lexical information . The system is in the course of development in collaboration with a number of computer scientists from computer industries and expert translators  . Some of the translation results are attached in the last  , which show the present level of the translation system  . Progressive improvement is expected in the next two years  .
