This paper proposes an analysis method for Japanese modality  . In this purpose , meaning of Japanese modality is classified into four semantic categories and the role of it is formalized into five modality functions  . Based on these formalizations , information and constraints to be applied to the modality analysis procedure are specified  . Then by combining these investigations with case analysis  , the analysis method is proposed . This analysis method has been applied to Japanese analysis for machine translation  . 
1. Introduction
Since the meaning of a sentence consists of both proposition and rnodality  , TM analysis of modality is as indispensable as that of proposition for natural language understanding and machine translation  . 
However studies on natural language analysis have mainly concerned with the propositional part  , and algorithms for analyzing r nodality have not yet been sufficiently developed  . The aim of this paper is to clarify the function of modality and to propose a method for analyzing the modality in Japanese sentences  . 
Structure of a Japanese complex sentence can be formalized roughly by iterative concatenation of simple sentences  . The simple sentence consists of cases and a predicate  . The cases have surface representations of noun phrases or adverb phrases while the predicate has that of verb or adjective or adjective verb  . A noun phrase is defined as the recursive concatenation of noun phrase or that of embedded sentence  . We have employed ' . he case structure as a basic meaning structure for a simple sentence  , and extended it to retain the construction of complex sentences mentioned  . Modaiity is additive information represented by auxiliary words such as modal particles  , ending particles , and auxiliary verbs and sentence adverbs . The modal particle is attached to a noun phrase or a sentence lement while the ending particle is attached to the enciposition of a sentence  . The auxiliary verb ! mmediately follows a verb phrase  . 
Modality represented in such grammatically different context is incorporated into the case structure  , and the result construction is named as an extended case structure Ivl which enable us to propose a uniform framework for analyzing both proposition and modality  . 
In this paper , we first classify modality into four semantic categories  . Second , we define five modality functions using the logical representation of the meaning and then characterize the roles of each function  . Third , we specify hard problems to be resolved in modality analysis  . Fourth , we list the information and constraints to be considered in establishing the procedure of modality analysis  . Then , we propose a method for analyzing modality based on these investigations  . Finally , we exemplify the analysis by showing translations from Japanese into English  . The method has been used to analyze Japanese sentences in a machine translation system  .  17~ 2 , Classification of modality Traditionally , modality has been classified into three categories  , i . e . tense , aspect and modal .   :0-! This classification is not sufficient for the deep analysis of the meaning structure of a sentence  , however , because it does not account for the role of Japanese modal particles  . Adding this role , we expand this classification into four categories  , namely tense , aspect , modal and implicature shown in Table 1 . Each category can be further classified into subcategories  , and those are shown in Table 2 through Table 5 ( Each table gives both examples of Japanese expressions and their English equivalents  )  . Our classification of modality features two characteristics oncerning the assignment of adverbs and modal particles :  ( 1 ) Among the two kinds of adverbs , namely sentence adverbs and case adverbs , we assign sentence adverbs to modality while case adverbs to case relations  . Sentence adverbs are classified into three subcategories in the modal

( Traditionally , all adverbs are assigned to modality . )  ( 2 ) Modal particles are assigned to modality and are classified into a distinct category  , implicature ( They have been usually discussed separately from modality  )  ~41 . 
3 . Modality functions and their roles By employing logical expression as the representation of the meaning structure  , we can define modality functions as operations on logical expressions in strict terms  . In the past , studies on modality analysis in logical f rame work treated each type of modality individually  . IsH6\]Here , we deal with it , however , as a whole and combine it with the propositional structure so that we can provide a uniform f ramework for the representation and the analysis of the meaning structure  . In this purpose we employ the higher order modal logic formalism  . It 1In this regard , we introduce the five types of modality functions  , which add or modify modality : I ) addition of the modality operator . 
2) surface modification of the case structure.
(3) semantic modification of the case structure.
(4) determination of the scope of negation , (5) addition of the implicative meaning . 
We will now discuss the roles of each type of modality function respectively by indicating their logical representations  . 
3 . 1 Add i t ion of the modal i ty operator This is the most fundamental function and it simply adds the modality meaning to the propositional meaning  . In the following two sentences ,   ( sl ) has no modality while ( s2 ) has modality: ( sl ) Hirokogahashiru . ( Hirokoruns . )
Run(Hiroko ), " ~ In the ~' ollowing . each example sentence is succeeded by an English translation and a logical representation  . f the meaning

(s2 ) is obtained by adding the durative aspect operator " teiru  ( progressive ) " to ( sl ) c ' ~ . 
3 . 2 Sur face mod i f i ca t ion of the case s t ruc ture This does not change the logical meaning structure even when the surface structure is modified  . However higher level information such as focus and attention is sometimes added  . 
The passive auxiliary verb " reru " or " rare ru " can modify the surface case structure without changing the logical meaning structure  . The focus is usually placed on the ~ ubject part of the passive sentence  , as follows : ( s3) Hirokogayasai we taberu . 
( Hzroko eats vegetables . , 3x(Vegetable(x)AEat(Hiroko , x )) , (s4) Yasaiga Hirokonitaberareru . 
( Vegetables are eaten by Hzroko . ) , 3 x (( Vegetable(x ) A Eat ( Hiroko , x )) A Focus(x )) , where the predicate Focus ( x ) signifies that the focus is placed on the argument x  . 
3 . 3 Semant ic modif ication of the case structure This results in one of the two alternatives :  ( a ) one argument is added to the original predicate , ( b : , a higher order predicate is introduced . 
Both changes are equivalent in meaning but the way of representing the change is different  . 
The following fragments of modality cause the semantic modification of the case structure : 
I ) causative Cseru " or " saseru ") , 2 J affected-passive Creru " or " rare ru ") , 3) hopeCtehoshii '" and " temoraitai ") , 4 ~ request , ~" temorau ") , 5) benefit (" tekureru . . . . teageru ", and " teyaru") .

( Taromakes Hirokoe at vegetables . )( a ) 3 x ( Vegetable(x ) /' , Eat'(Hiroko , x , Taro)) , o(b)3x ( Vegetable(x ) ACAUSE(Taro , 
Eat(Hiroko , x ))) , where the predicate Eat '( x , y , z ) is obtained by adding the argument z corresponding to the causative agent to the predicate Eatx  , y ) in ( s3) . 
For another example , though the auxiliary verb " reru " or " rare ru " has five meanings  , namely , " passive " , " affected-passive " , " ability " , " respective " and " spontaneity " , " passive " meaning among them falls into type ( 2 ) above while " affected-passive " meaning falls into this type and the affected-agent is added :   Is6  ) Taroga Hirokoai ya sai wo taberareru . 
(Taro was'adversely ) affected by Hiroko's eating vegetables . ) ( a ) 3x ( Vegetable(x/xEat " ( Hiroko . x . Taro)) , or ( b ) 3x ( Vegetable(x ) AAFFECTED-PASSIVE(Taro , Eat(Hiroko , x))) .

The modal particle " wa " determines the role of the auxiliary verb " nai " as a partial negation while the case particle " ga " determines it as total negation  . In the following sentences ,   ( s9 ) is partially negated while ( s8 ) is totally negated : ( s7 ) Zen'ingakuru . \ [ Everybody comes . ) vx(S(x ) 3 Come(x )), ( s8) Zen'ingakonai . ( Nobody comes . ) vx(S(x ) ~ ~ Come(x )), ( sg ) Zen'in wak on ai . ( Note very body comes . ) -- vx(S(x ~ ~ Come(x )) , where the predicate S ( x ) denotes " zen'in\[all the persons ) " .

29 3 . 5 Addit ion of the impl icat ive mean ing An extra logical formula corresponding to the implicative meaning is added by modal particles such as % hika  ( only f and ~ dake ( only ) " as in: ( sl0 ) Hirokowaya saishi katabenai . 
( Hiroko eats nothing but vegetables . ) ~ x ( Vegetable(x ) A Eat ( Hiroko , x )) Avx (- ~ Vegetable(x ) ~- , Eat ( Hiroko , x)) . 
4, Problems in modality analysis 4 . 1 Ambiguity of the modality meaning ( I ) Ambiguity due to multiple meaning The aspect expression " teiru " has three different kinds of meanings  , that is , the " durative " , " iterative " or " terminative-state " aspects . For example , ( sll ) Hiroko gay as ai wotabeteiru . 
( Hirokoi seating , eats and eats . has eatenlvege tables . ) 3x ( Vegetable(x)/x\[durative\] , \[ iterative \] , \[ terminatire-state \]
Eat ( Hiroko , x)).
( 21 Ambiguity concerned with case structure As stated in Section  3  . 3 above , the auxiliary verb " reru " or " rare ru " has five meanings  , and , among them , the " passive " and " affected-passive " meanings result in modification to the case structure  . Therefore , disambiguation of the meaning of ~ reru " or " rareru " has a close relationship to analysis of the propositional meaning  . 
Moreover the auxiliary verb " rareru " in the following  s12  ) means " respect " , and that in ( s13) means " passive " , respectively . Whereas , both expressions are same except the additional meaning of respect and focus  , as follows : ( sl2) Sensei gay as ai wotaber are ru . 
( The teacher eats vegetables . ) 3 x ( Vegetable(x ) / kE at the-Teacher , x))
ARespect(Speaker , the-Teacher ) , ( sl3) Y as aiga sense in it a berarer u . 
( Vegetables are eaten by the Teacher . ; 3x((Vegetable(x)/xEat(the-Teacher , x )) / xFocus(x )) , where the predicate Respect x , y ) means that x respects y . 
4.2 Scope of modality
Even if ' , hemain clause has a negative expression , it does not always mean that the main clause is negated  . 
Sometimes the subordinate clause is negated . We call this phenomenon the transfer of negation . 
Furthermore even if rnodality involved is not negation  , it sometimes affects the subordinate clause . 
Although the main clause in the following ( s14 ) is not usually negated , the subordinate clause is . 
Nevertheless , the tense information in the main clause has an effect on the subordinate clause  .   ( s14 ) is constructed from ( s14-1 ) and ( s14-2 ) by a simple coordinate conjunction , however the corresponding logical expression is not a simple concatenation of each logical expression :  ( sl4 ) Tarowa hige wo sot be kaishaeikanakatta . 
( Taro went to the company withouts having . )\[ past\]--Shave(Taro , beard)
Apast\]Go(Taro , Company ) , ( sl4-1) Tarowahigewosoru . ( Taroshaves beard . 
Shave ( Taro , beard ) , ( sl4-2) Tarowakaishaeikanakatta . 
( Taro did not go to the company . )\[ past\]--Go(Taro , Company) . 
(sS ) and ( s9 ) also exemplify the problem for determining the scope of negation  . 
4.3 Treatment of implicative meaning
Modal particles such as " shika ( only ) " and " sae ( even ) " convey individual implicative meaning . In order to obtain the logical representation of the implicative meaning  , we are forced to provide different formulae expressive of the each meaning of each modal particle  . For example , if we assign the formula ( fl ) to the expression % hik a . . . nai " which consists of the modal particle " shika " and auxiliary verb " nai "  , we get the logical representation of the sentence  Is10  ) by the procedure of ~ , -calculus shown in Fig . I . 
(fl)"shika...nai'--~LP,kQkR(3x(P(x)ARQ(x))

As can be seen from the example , the logical formula for the implicative meaning is very individual  . This concludes that specification of it for each meaning is very complicated and hard  , and a more effective method is therefore needed . 
5 . Information and constraints on modality analysis  ( 1 ) l , exic ai meaning The lexical meaning assigned to each modality expression is the most fundamental information  . So we need to specify and provide it . For example , the lexical meaning of the auxiliary verb " ta " is generally the " past " tense as in:  ( slS ) Hirokogahashitta . ( Hirokoran . )\[ past\]Run(H . ;roko) . 
(2) Predicate features
Predicate features are available for disambiguating the meaning of modality  . 
Though the aspect auxiliary verb " teiru " is ambiguous in meaning  , we can resolve it by using predicate features such as the " stative "  , " continuous " and " spontaneous " , as in :\[ durative\]Run(Hiroko) , ( sl7)Ak axigakieteiru . ( The light is turned of f . )\[terminative-state \] Turn-off ( the-Light) , where the verb mnashiru ( run ) " has the " continuous " feature while the verb " kieru  ( turn off ) " has the " spontaneous " feature . The aspect expression " teiru " following a " continuous " verb usually means the " durative " aspect  , and " teiru " following a " spontaneous " verb usually means the " terminative-state " aspect  . 
The " spontaneity " meaning of " reru " or " rare ru " is realized only when it follows the verbs having spontaneity feature such as " omoid as u  ( remember ) " and " anjiru ( care ) " . 
(3) Noun phrases and adverbs
Some kinds of noun phrases , adverbs , and their semantic ategories can be utilized to disambiguate he meaning of modality  , when they occur simultaneously with it . 
( sl8) Hiroko gayasaiwoi . m . at a beteiru , ( Hirokoi seating vegetables now . ) 3x ( Vegetable(x )

( Hiroko has already eat envege table . ) 3x ( Vegetable(x ) A\[terminative-state\]
Eat ' ( Hiroko , x , already)).
In the above examples , the adverb " ima ( now ) " is concerned with the " durative " aspect , while " sudeni ( already ) " is concerned with the " terminative-state " aspect  . The argument z of the predicate Eat "'( x , y , z ) represents time information . 
(4) Modal particles
As discussed in Section 3 ( sentences (  8 ) and ( s9 ) ) , the modal particle " wa " occurrings imultaneously with negation suggests partial negation  . 
(5) Conjunctive relations
Conjunctive relations are related to the scope of modality  . If the subordinate clause has the following conjunctive relations represented by  ( a ) the conjunctive particle " te " , or ( b ) a relative noun such as " toki ( trine ) " or " mae ( before ) " modified by embedded sentences , the transfer of negation can be predicted as in sentence  ( s14 )  . Otherwise , the transfer will never occurs as follows : ( s20 ) Tarowa hige wo sottaga kaishaeikanakatta . 
( Though Taroshaved his beard , he did not go to the company . )\[ past\]S have(Taro , beard)
A\[past\]~Go(Taro , Company).
(6 ) Semantic relations between the subordinate c lause and the main clause This information is used to determine the scope of negation in the main clause  . In the subordinate clause with the conjunctive particle " te "  , if the event expressed by it is subsidiary for the occurrence of the event in the main clause  , the transfer of negation can occur . On the other hand , if the subordinate event is indispensable to the occurrence of the main event  , the transfer never occurs . For example , in ( s14) , since the modifier event Shave ( Taro , beard ) is a subsidiary event for the occurrence of the main event Go  ( Taro , Company ) , the transfer of negation is possible . In the following sentence ( s21) , however , since the event Go(Taro , Washington ) is an indispensable event for the occurrnece of the main event See  ( Taro , White-House ) , the transferts impossible : ( s21 ) Tarowa Washingtoneitte
White House wominakatta.
(Taro did not see the White House when he went to Washington  . )\[ past\]Go(Taro , Washington ) A\[past\]- , See ( Taro , the-White-House) . 
31 6 . Modality analysis 6 . 1 Strategy of the modal i ty ana lys is Considering the five modality functions defined in Section  3  , it is apparent that the logical analysis method alone is not effective for modality analysis  . 
There are three reasons for this: ( 1 ) Reference to other expressions is needed to resolve the ambiguity of the modality function  ,   ( 2 ) Structural modification occurs when the scope of negation is transferred  ,   ( 3 ) Analysis of the implicative meaning sometimes cause the change of logical expression  . 
There remains , however , the problem of taking the individuality of each modality into account  . For some kinds of modality , the result of the case analysis or the conjunctive analysis is used to analyze it  . These represent the reasons why we propose an analysis method consisting of the following three modules combined with the case analysis and the conjunctive analysis :  (  1 ) pre-case-analysis : activated before the case analysis  ,   ( 2 ) post-case-analysis : activated after the case analysis  ,   ( 3 ) post-conjunctive-analysis : activated after the conjunctive analysis  . 
The relationship of these three modules to the case analysis and the conjunctive analysis is shown in Fig  .

Framework of them , dality analysis 6 . 2 Algorithms of each subanalysis ( 1 ) Pre-case-analysis The modality whose analysis requires only lexical meaning or which causes a change of the case structure is analysed at this stage  . The case frame to be assigned to the predicate is mcdified by utilizing the result of this analysis before starting the case analysis  . As for the semantically ambiguous auxiliary verb " reru " or " rare ru "  , its role is only predicted at this stage , because it is also concerned with the modification of the case structure  . After case analysis , the plausibility of the prediction is evaluated . The modification of the case frame is as follows :   ( a ) For the " passive " meaning of " reru " or " raxeru "  ( which causes a surface change to the case structure as mentioned in Section  3  . 2) , the object case of the original case frame is changed into the surface subjective case  , and the modality category " passive " is assigned to the meaning structure  . If two object cases exist , two possible modifications are performed . 
( b ) With the modality causing a semantic change to the case structure  ( for the modality function stated in Section 3 . 3) , a new case is added as follows: ( bl ) For the " causative " , " affected-passive " , " hope " or " request " meaning : A new agent ( e . g . 
causative-agent/affected-agent ) is added , and the case particle of the original subjective case is changed from " ga " to " hi "  ,   ( b2 ) With the " benefit " meaning : A beneficiary case is added  . The case particle in this case is " hi " . 
Also the modality category corresponding to each meaning  ( e . g . " causative " , " affected-passive " ) is assigned to the meaning structure . 
(2) Post-case-analysis
The modality whose analysis requires case structure information is analyzed at this stage  . This module determines the function of the modality as follows:  ( a ) \[f the category of the modality expression is unique  , this category is assigned to the meaning : ; tructure . 
( b ) if a daem on ( a procedure to resolve ambiguities by using heuristics  ) is attached to the rnodality expression , it performs the three tasks : ( bl ) disambignating the function of the modality expression  , ( b2) detcrmining the scope , ( b3) adding the implicative meaning . 
The daemon utilizes the information mentioned in ( I )  - ( 4 ) in Sect , ion 5 . For example , a daemon attached to the aspect expression " teiru " works as shown in Fig  .  3 . 
(3) Post-conjunctive-analysis
Following the conjunctive analysis between the subordinate clause and the main clause  , this module is activated to determine whether the modality in the main clause also operates on the subordinate clause  . 
This module utilizes heuristics consisted of all of the " terminative-state " or " durative " or " iterative " aspect ?\[ no

For negation in the main clause , the transfer of negation is considered . Whether or not the modifier event is subsidiary for the occurence of the main event is tested using the semantic relations assigned to the  ) redicate of the main clause .

Heuristics which analyse the scope of the auxiliary verb " ta "  6  . 3 Application to Japanese analysis ( I ) Extended case analysis We have already proposed a method named extended case analysis for Japanese sentences  . IvTInput to the extended case analysis is an ordered list of word frames produced by a morphological analysis  . The analysis begins to predict a constituent construction of the sentence to be analyzed by utilizing syntactic structure patterns  , and then enter into the detail analysis of semantic relations between pairs of the modifier and the modificant by utilizing semantic relation frames  . There are four types of the semantic relations , namely , case relation , noun concept relation , embeding relation and conjunctive relation . All of these semantic relations are analyzed in a uniform framework  . The both analyses go on iteratively and/or recursively from a small chunk of constituents to large one  . Each iteration and recursion executes both the prediction of the syntactic structure and the analysis of semantic structure  . The modality analysis is incorporated into those processes  . 
Let us show the modaiity analysis process for the following example sentence :  ( s22 ) Nikuwanokotteite , ya saida kega Kirokonitabe rareteita . 
M eat had remained , and only vegetables had been eaten by Hiroko . 
At first , it is analysed that this sentence is a complex sentence by utilizing syntactic structure patterns  . 
After semantic structures of the modifier and the main clause are analysed  , conjunctive relation between these clauses is analyzed  . Now , we show analysis of the main sentence . 
The following case elements and a predicate are analysed by applying structure patterns before starting case analysis :  case1 = " yasai " , " ga " , " dake " , case 2 = ~ liroko " , " ai " , predicate="taberu " , " rareru " , % eiru " , % a ' , where " dake " , " rare rn ' , " teiru " , and " ta " are modality exp ~' essions . " Hiroko " and " yasai " have semantic categories  , \[ human \] and\[food\]respectively in each wordframe  .

Case frame is prepared for each meaning of each predicate  . An intrinsic case frame for the verb " taberu ( eat ) " is as follows ( Optional cases such as time and place are omitted here  ) :\[ the intrinsic case frame of the verb " taberu  ( eat ) "\] :
Agent--\[human \]," ga ",
Object=\[food\],~wo".
Each case slot in the case frame is assigned semantic categories and case particles as constraints to be satisfied by the filler  . 
The following alternative case frames produced by modifying the intrinsic frame are also prepared before starting case analysis because of the existence of the auxiliary verb ~ rare ru " :\[" passive " modification of the case frame \]: 
Agent=\[human \]," hi",
Object=\[food\] , " ga " , \[" affected-passive " modification of the case frame \]: 
Affected-agent-\[human \]," ga ",
Agent=\[human\],"ni",
Object-\[food\],"wo".
These three case frames are examined whether each case element in the sentence satisfies constraints  . As a result , in this case , " passive " modification case frame is selected as a best matching  , and case role of each case element is determined as follows : case l = Object  , case 2 = Agent . 
This result is showing that the meaning of ~ rareru " is " passive "  . 
(3 ) Determination of meaning of modality Modality by modal particles in case elements and att xi Hary verbs are analyzed  . Analysis of " teiru " is :33 performed by the heuristics shown in Fig .  3 , where the meaning is determined as " terminative -state " judging from the fact that " teiru " follows " raxeru "  . The meaning of the modal particle " dake " is multiple  , that is , " limitation " and " degree " . In this case , " limitation " is selected by heuristics . 
(4 ) Determination of scope of modality in the main c lause After conjunctive analysis between the modifier and the main clause  , scope of the auxiliary verb " ta " in the main clause is analyzed  . Using heuristics shown in Fig .  4 , it is analyzed that " ta " also operates on the subordinate clause  . 
In a result , the meaning structure of ( s22 ) is obtained as follows : 3x ( (Meat ( x ) A\[past\]\[terminative-state\]Remain ( x ) )


AV x((--Vegetable(x ) ~- , \[ pastl\[terminative-state\]Eat(Hiroko , x))

An English sentence corresponding to this semantic structure is shown in  ( s22 )  . 
6.4 Virture of modality analysis
We show contributions of modality analysis to understanding and quality of translation for the following example sentences  . 
(s23 ) Denshawasenronoueshika hashirukotogadeki na_Aiga  , watashigaki no ueigademit a densha was of a wo to buk o to modek it a  . 
Though a train can run only on a rail road , the train\[saw in a movie yesterday could also fly  . 
(s24 ) A natawa densha gas or a wo to bukotoga de kiru to omoim asuka  . 
Do you think that a train canfly ? ( 1 ) \[ speech act \] As shown in ( s24 )  , modality contains much information concerning speech act  ( question , command , guess , intention , etc . ) . In conversational systems such as qustion answering systems  , these meaning can be used for selecting a propriate reactions  . 
(2 ) \[ type of object \] Analysis results of aspect or tense are used for determining the type of objects  . 
The subordinate clause of ( s23 ) describes a general character of ' densha ( trmn ) " , and the first occurrence of " densha " denotes a generic object  . On the other hand , the second occurrence of " denaha " is modified by an embedded sentence  , and " densha " denotes a specific object which " I saw in a movie yesterday "  . Like this , if the character of the event is analysed by the analysis of aspect or tense  , the character of the objects can be specified . 
(3 ) \[ translation \] As shown in the translated sentences in  ( s23 ) and ( s24 )  , results of the modality analysis are clearly realized in quality of translated sentences  . In these sentences , modality such as " limitation " , " negation " , " ability " , " past " , " quetion " appears . 
7. Conclusion
We proposed an analysis method for Japanese modality  . In this purpose , we classified the meaning of modality into four categories  , and then defined five modality functions which characterize the role of modality  . By employing logical expressions to represent the meaning structure  , we could effectively specify the modality function  . Though logical expression has the same expressive power as frames or semantic networks  , a more concise semantic representation can be realized by this method  . 
Although we dealt with the modality analysis restricted within the scope of one sentence in this paper  , we must investigate the effect of discourse information on the analysis of modality in the future  . 
We have applied this modality analysis method to the Japanese sentence analysis in the JapaneseEnglish experimental machine translation system  ,
