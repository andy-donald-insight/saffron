Abstract
Most previous work on multilingual sentiment analysis has focused on methods to adapt sentiment resources from resource-rich languages to resource-poor languages . We present a novel approach for joint bilingual sentiment classification at the sentence level that augments available labeled data in each language with unlabeled parallel data . We rely on the intuition that the sentiment labels for parallel sentences should be similar and present a model that jointly learns improved monolingual sentiment classifiers for each language.
Experiments on multiple data sets show that the proposed approach (1) outperforms the monolingual baselines , significantly improving the accuracy for both languages by 3.44%-8.12%; (2) outperforms two standard approaches for leveraging unlabeled data ; and (3) produces ( albeit smaller ) performance gains when employing pseudo-parallel data from machine translation engines.
1 Introduction
The field of sentiment analysis has quickly attracted the attention of researchers and practitioners alike ( e.g . Pang et al , 2002; Turney , 2002; Hu and Liu , 2004; Wiebe et al , 2005; Breck et al , 2007; Pang and Lee , 2008). 1 Indeed , sentiment analysis systems , which mine opinions from textual sources ( e.g . news , blogs , and reviews ), can be used in a wide variety of * The work was conducted when the first author was visiting

applications , including interpreting product reviews , opinion retrieval and political polling.
Not surprisingly , most methods for sentiment classification are supervised learning techniques , which require training data annotated with the appropriate sentiment labels ( e.g . document-level or sentence-level positive vs . negative polarity).
This data is difficult and costly to obtain , and must be acquired separately for each language under consideration.
Previous work in multilingual sentiment analysis has therefore focused on methods to adapt sentiment resources ( e.g . lexicons ) from resource-rich languages ( typically English ) to other languages , with the goal of transferring sentiment or subjectivity analysis capabilities from English to other languages ( e.g . Mihalcea et al (2007); Banea et al (2008; 2010); Wan (2008; 2009); Prettenhofer and Stein (2010)). In recent years , however , sentiment-labeled data is gradually becoming available for languages other than English ( e.g . Seki et al (2007; 2008); Nakagawa et al . (2010); Schulz et al (2010)). In addition , there is still much room for improvement in existing monolingual ( including English ) sentiment classifiers , especially at the sentence level ( Pang and Lee , 2008).
This paper tackles the task of bilingual sentiment analysis . In contrast to previous work , we (1) assume that some amount of sentiment-labeled data is available for the language pair under study , and (2) investigate methods to simultaneously improve sentiment classification for both languages . Given the labeled data in each language , we propose an approach that exploits an unlabeled parallel corpus with the following intuition : two sentences or documents that are parallel ( i.e . translations of one another ) should exhibit the same sentiment ? their sentiment labels ( e.g . polarity , subjectivity , intensity ) should be similar . The proposed maximum entropy-based EM approach jointly learns two monolingual sentiment classifiers by treating the sentiment labels in the unlabeled parallel text as unobserved latent variables , and maximizes the regularized joint likelihood of the language-specific labeled data together with the inferred sentiment labels of the parallel text . Although our approach should be applicable at the document-level and for additional sentiment tasks , we focus on sentence-level polarity classification in this work.
We evaluate our approach for English and Chinese on two dataset combinations ( see Section 4) and find that the proposed approach outperforms the monolingual baselines ( i.e . maximum entropy and SVM classifiers ) as well as two alternative methods for leveraging unlabeled data ( transductive SVMs ( Joachims , 1999b ) and cotraining ( Blum and Mitchell , 1998)). Accuracy is significantly improved for both languages , by 3.44%-8.12%. We furthermore find that improvements , albeit smaller , are obtained when the parallel data is replaced with a pseudo-parallel ( i.e . automatically translated ) corpus . To our knowledge , this is the first multilingual sentiment analysis study to focus on methods for simultaneously improving sentiment classification for a pair of languages based on unlabeled data rather than resource adaptation from one language to another.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows.
Section 2 introduces related work . In Section 3, the proposed joint model is described . Sections 4 and 5, respectively , provide the experimental setup and results ; the conclusion ( Section 6) follows.
2 Related Work
Multilingual Sentiment Analysis . There is a growing body of work on multilingual sentiment analysis . Most approaches focus on resource adaptation from one language ( usually English ) to other languages with few sentiment resources.
Mihalcea et al (2007), for example , generate subjectivity analysis resources in a new language from English sentiment resources by leveraging a bilingual dictionary or a parallel corpus . Banea et al . (2008; 2010) instead automatically translate the English resources using automatic machine translation engines for subjectivity classification.
Prettenhofer and Stein (2010) investigate crosslingual sentiment classification from the perspective of domain adaptation based on structural correspondence learning ( Blitzer et al , 2006).
Approaches that do not explicitly involve resource adaptation include Wan (2009), which uses cotraining ( Blum and Mitchell , 1998) with English vs . Chinese features comprising the two independent ? views ? to exploit unlabeled Chinese data and a labeled English corpus and thereby improves Chinese sentiment classification.
Another notable approach is the work of Boyd-Graber and Resnik (2010), which presents a generative model --- supervised multilingual latent Dirichlet alocation --- that jointly models topics that are consistent across languages , and employs them to better predict sentiment ratings.
Unlike the methods described above , we focus on simultaneously improving the performance of sentiment classification in a pair of languages by developing a model that relies on sentiment-labeled data in each language as well as unlabeled parallel text for the language pair.
Semisupervised Learning . Another line of related work is semisupervised learning , which combines labeled and unlabeled data to improve the performance of the task of interest ( Zhu and Goldberg , 2009). Among the popular semisupervised methods ( e.g . EM on Na?ve Bayes ( Nigam et al , 2000), cotraining ( Blum and Mitchell , 1998), transductive SVMs ( Joachims , 1999b ), and coregularization ( Sindhwani et al , 2005; Amini et al , 2010)), our approach employs the EM algorithm , extending it to the bilingual case based on maximum entropy . We compare to cotraining and transductive SVMs in Section 5.
Multilingual NLP for Other Tasks . Finally , there exists related work using bilingual resources to help other NLP tasks , such as word sense disambiguation ( e.g . Ido and Itai (1994)), parsing ( e.g . Burkett and Klein (2008); Zhao et al (2009); Burkett et al (2010)), information retrieval ( Gao et al ., 2009), named entity detection ( Burkett et al , 2010); topic extraction ( e.g . Zhang et al , 2010), text classification ( e.g . Amini et al , 2010), and hyponym-relation acquisition ( e.g . Oh et al , 2009).
321
In these cases , multilingual models increase performance because different languages contain different ambiguities and therefore present complementary views on the shared underlying labels . Our work shares a similar motivation.
3 A Joint Model with Unlabeled Parallel
Text
We propose a maximum entropy-based statistical model . Maximum entropy ( MaxEnt ) models1 have been widely used in many NLP tasks ( Berger et al , 1996; Ratnaparkhi , 1997; Smith , 2006). The models assign the conditional probability of the label given the observation as follows : (1) where is a real-valued vector of feature weights and is a feature function that maps pairs to a nonnegative real-valued feature vector . Each feature has an associated parameter , , which is called its weight ; and is the corresponding normalization factor.
Maximum likelihood parameter estimation ( training ) for such a model , with a set of labeled examples , amounts to solving the following optimization problem : (2) 3.1 Problem Definition Given two languages and , suppose we have two distinct ( i.e . not parallel ) sets of sentiment-labeled data , and written in and respectively . In addition , we have unlabeled ( w.r.t.
sentiment ) bilingual ( in and ) parallel data that are defined as follows.
where denotes the polarity of the - th instance ( positive or negative ); and are respectively the numbers of labeled instances in and ; and are parallel instances in and , respectively ( i.e . they are supposed to be 1They are sometimes referred to as loglinear models , but also known as exponential models , generalized linear models , or logistic regression.
translations of one another ), whose labels and are unobserved , but according to the intuition outlined in Section 1, should be similar.
Given the input data and , our task is to jointly learn two monolingual sentiment classifiers ? one for and one for . With MaxEnt , we learn from the input data : where and are the vectors of feature weights for and , respectively ( for brevity we denote them as and in the remaining sections ). In this study , we focus on sentence-level sentiment classification , i.e . each is a sentence , and and are parallel sentences.
3.2 The Joint Model
Given the problem definition above , we now present a novel model to exploit the correspondence of parallel sentences in unlabeled bilingual text . The model maximizes the following joint likelihood with respect to and : (3) where denotes or ; the first term on the righthand side is the likelihood of labeled data for both and ; and the second term is the likelihood of the unlabeled parallel data .
If we assume that parallel sentences are perfect translations , the two sentences in each pair should have the same polarity label , which gives us : (4) where is the unobserved class label for the - th instance in the unlabeled data . This probability directly models the sentiment label agreement between and .
However , there could be considerable noise in realworld parallel data , i.e . the sentence pairs may be noisily parallel ( or even comparable ) instead of fully parallel ( Munteanu and Marcu , 2005). In such noisy cases , the labels ( positive or negative ) could be different for the two monolingual sentences in a sentence pair . Although we do not know the exact probability that a sentence pair exhibits the same label , we can approximate it using their translation probabilities , which can be computed using word alignment toolkits such as Giza ++ ( Och and Ney , 2003) or the Berkeley word aligner ( Liang et al , 2006). The intuition here is that if the translation probability of two sentences is high , the probability that they have the same sentiment label should be high as well . Therefore , by considering the noise in parallel data , we get : (5) where is the translation probability of the - th sentence pair in ;2 is the opposite of ; the first term models the probability that and have the same label ; and the second term models the probability that they have different labels.
By further considering the weight to ascribe to the unlabeled data vs . the labeled data ( and the weight for the L2-norm regularization ), we get the following regularized joint log likelihood to be maximized : (6) where the first term on the righthand side is the log likelihood of the labeled data from both and the second is the log likelihood of the unlabeled parallel data , multiplied by , a constant that controls the contribution of the unlabeled data ; and is a regularization constant that penalizes model complexity or large feature weights . When is 0, the algorithm ignores the unlabeled data and degenerates to two MaxEnt models trained on only the labeled data.
3.3 The EM Algorithm on MaxEnt
To solve the optimization problem for the model , we need to jointly estimate the optimal parameters for the two monolingual classifiers by finding : (7) This can be done with an EM algorithm , whose steps are summarized in Algorithm 1. First , the MaxEnt parameters , and , are estimated from 2The probability should be rescaled within the range of [0, 1], where 0.5 means that we are completely unsure if the sentences are translations of each other or not , and only those translation pairs with a probability larger than 0.5 are meaningful for our purpose.
just the labeled data . Then , in the E-step , the classifiers , based on current values of and , compute for each labeled example and assign probabilistically-weighted class labels to each unlabeled example . Next , in the M-step , the parameters , and , are updated using both the original labeled data ( and ) and the newly labeled data . These last two steps are iterated until convergence or a predefined iteration limit .

Output as s , and as In the M-step , we can optimize the regularized joint log likelihood using any gradient-based optimization technique ( Malouf , 2002). The gradient for Equation 3 based on Equation 4 is shown in Appendix A ; those for Equations 5 and 6 can be derived similarly . In our experiments , we use the LBFGS algorithm ( Liu et al , 1989) and run EM until the change in regularized joint log likelihood is less than 1e5 or we reach 100 iterations.3 3Since the EM-based algorithm may find a local maximum of the objective function , the initialization of the parameters is important . Our experiments show that an effective maximum can usually be found by initializing the parameters with those learned from the labeled data ; performance would be much worse if we initialize all the parameters to 0 or 1.
323 3.4 Pseudo-Parallel Labeled and Unlabeled
Data
We also consider the case where a parallel corpus is not available : to obtain a pseudo-parallel corpus ( i.e . sentences in one language with their corresponding automatic translations ), we use an automatic machine translation system ( e.g . Google machine translation 4 ) to translate unlabeled indomain data from to or vice versa.
Since previous work ( Banea et al , 2008; 2010; Wan , 2009) has shown that it could be useful to automatically translate the labeled data from the source language into the target language , we can further incorporate such translated labeled data into the joint model by adding the following component into Equation 6: (8) where is the alternative class of , is the automatically translated example from ; and is a constant that controls the weight of the translated labeled data.
4 Experimental Setup 4.1 Data Sets and Preprocessing The following labeled datasets are used in our experiments.
MPQA ( Labeled English Data ): The Multi-
Perspective Question Answering ( MPQA ) corpus ( Wiebe et al , 2005) consists of newswire documents manually annotated with phrase-level subjectivity information . We extract all sentences containing strong ( i.e . intensity is medium or higher ), sentiment-bearing ( i.e . polarity is positive or negative ) expressions following Choi and Cardie (2008). Sentences with both positive and negative strong expressions are then discarded , and the polarity of each remaining sentence is set to that of its sentiment-bearing expression(s).
NTCIR-EN ( Labeled English Data ) and
NTCIR-CH ( Labeled Chinese Data ): The
NTCIR Opinion Analysis task ( Seki et al , 2007; 2008) provides sentiment-labeled news data in Chinese , Japanese and English . Only those sentences with a polarity label ( positive or negative ) agreed to by at least two annotators are extracted . We use the Chinese data from NTCIR6 4http://translate.google.com / as our Chinese labeled data . Since far fewer sentences in the English data pass the annotator agreement filter , we combine the English data from NTCIR6 and NTCIR7. The Chinese sentences are segmented using the Stanford Chinese word segmenter ( Tseng et al , 2005).
The number of sentences in each of these datasets is shown in Table 1. In our experiments , we evaluate two settings of the data : (1)
MPQA+NTCIR-CH , and (2) NTCIR-EN+NTCIR-
CH . In each setting , the English labeled data constitutes and the Chinese labeled data , .
MPQA NTCIR-EN NTCIR-CH
Positive 1,471 (30%) 528 (30%) 2,378 (55%) Negative 3,487 (70%) 1,209 (70%) 1,916 (45%)
Total 4,958 1,737 4,294
Table 1: Sentence Counts for the Labeled Data Unlabeled Parallel Text and its Preprocessing.
For the unlabeled parallel text , we use the ISI ChineseEnglish parallel corpus ( Munteanu and Marcu , 2005), which was extracted automatically from news articles published by Xinhua News Agency in the Chinese Gigaword (2nd Edition ) and English Gigaword (2nd Edition ) collections.
Because sentence pairs in the ISI corpus are quite noisy , we rely on Giza ++ ( Och and Ney , 2003) to obtain a new translation probability for each sentence pair , and select the 100,000 pairs with the highest translation probabilities.5 We also try to remove neutral sentences from the parallel data since they can introduce noise into our model , which deals only with positive and negative examples . To do this , we train a single classifier from the combined Chinese and English labeled data for each data setting above by concatenating the original English and Chinese feature sets . We then classify each unlabeled sentence pair by combining the two sentences in each pair into one . We choose the most confidently predicted 10,000 positive and 10,000 negative pairs to constitute the unlabeled parallel corpus for each data setting.
5We removed sentence pairs with an original confidence score ( given in the corpus ) smaller than 0.98, and also removed the pairs that are too long ( more than 60 characters in one sentence ) to facilitate Giza ++. We first obtain translation probabilities for both directions ( i.e . Chinese to English and English to Chinese ) with Giza ++, take the log of the product of those two probabilities , and then divide it by the sum of lengths of the two sentences in each pair.
324 4.2 Baseline Methods
In our experiments , the proposed joint model is compared with the following baseline methods.
MaxEnt : This method learns a MaxEnt classifier for each language given the monolingual labeled data ; the unlabeled data is not used.
SVM : This method learns an SVM classifier for each language given the monolingual labeled data ; the unlabeled data is not used . SVMlight ( Joachims , 1999a ) is used for all the SVM-related experiments.
Monolingual TSVM ( TSVM-M ): This method learns two transductive SVM ( TSVM ) classifiers given the monolingual labeled data and the monolingual unlabeled data for each language.
Bilingual TSVM ( TSVM-B ): This method learns one TSVM classifier given the labeled training data in two languages together with the unlabeled sentences by combining the two sentences in each unlabeled pair into one . We expect this method to perform better than TSVM-M since the combined ( bilingual ) unlabeled sentences could be more helpful than the unlabeled monolingual sentences.
CoTraining with SVMs ( Co-SVM ): This method applies SVM-based cotraining given both the labeled training data and the unlabeled parallel data following Wan (2009). First , two monolingual SVM classifiers are built based on only the corresponding labeled data , and then they are bootstrapped by adding the most confident predicted examples from the unlabeled data into the training set . We run bootstrapping for 100 iterations . In each iteration , we select the most confidently predicted 50 positive and 50 negative sentences from each of the two classifiers , and take the union of the resulting 200 sentence pairs as the newly labeled training data . ( Examples with conflicting labels within the pair are not included .) 5 Results and Analysis In our experiments , the methods are tested in the two data settings with the corresponding unlabeled parallel corpus as mentioned in Section 4.6 We use 6 The results reported in this section employ Equation 4.
Preliminary experiments showed that Equation 5 does not significantly improve the performance in our case , which is reasonable since we choose only sentence pairs with the highest translation probabilities to be our unlabeled data ( see
Section 4.1).
5-fold crossvalidation and report average accuracy ( also MicroF1 in this case ) and MacroF1 scores.
Unigrams are used as binary features for all models , as Pang et al (2002) showed that binary features perform better than frequency features for sentiment classification . The weights for unlabeled data and regularization , and , are set to 1 unless otherwise stated . Later , we will show that the proposed approach performs well with a wide range of parameter values.7 5.1 Method Comparison We first compare the proposed joint model ( Joint ) with the baselines in Table 2. As seen from the table , the proposed approach outperforms all five baseline methods in terms of both accuracy and MacroF1 for both English and Chinese and in both of the data settings . 8 By making use of the unlabeled parallel data , our proposed approach improves the accuracy , compared to MaxEnt , by 8.12% ( or 33.27% error reduction ) on English and 3.44% ( or 16.92% error reduction ) on Chinese in the first setting , and by 5.07% ( or 19.67% error reduction ) on English and 3.87% ( or 19.4% error reduction ) on Chinese in the second setting.
Among the baselines , the best is Co-SVM ; TSVMs do not always improve performance using the unlabeled data compared to the standalone SVM ; and TSVM-B outperforms TSVM-M except for Chinese in the second setting . The MPQA data is more difficult in general compared to the NTCIR data . Without unlabeled parallel data , the performance on the Chinese data is better than on the English data , which is consistent with results reported in NTCIR6 ( Seki et al , 2007).
Overall , the unlabeled parallel data improves classification accuracy for both languages when using our proposed joint model and Co-SVM . The joint model makes better use of the unlabeled parallel data than Co-SVM or TSVMs presumably because of its attempt to jointly optimize the two monolingual models via soft ( probabilistic ) assignments of the unlabeled instances to classes in each iteration , instead of the hard assignments in Co-SVM and TSVMs . Although English sentiment 7The code is at http://sites.google.com/site/lubin2010.
8 Significance is tested using paired t-tests with <0.05: ? denotes statistical significance compared to the corresponding performance of MaxEnt ; * denotes statistical significance compared to SVM ; and ? denotes statistical significance compared to Co-SVM.
325 classification alone is more difficult than Chinese for our datasets , we obtain greater performance gains for English by exploiting unlabeled parallel data as well as the Chinese labeled data.
5.2 Varying the Weight and Amount of
Unlabeled Data
Figure 1 shows the accuracy curve of the proposed approach for the two data settings when varying the weight for the unlabeled data , , from 0 to 1.
When is set to 0, the joint model degenerates to two MaxEnt models trained with only the labeled data.
We can see that the performance gains for the proposed approach are quite remarkable even when is set to 0.1; performance is largely stable after reaches 0.4. Although MPQA is more difficult in general compared to the NTCIR data , we still see steady improvements in performance with unlabeled parallel data . Overall , the proposed approach performs quite well for a wide range of parameter values of .
Figure 2 shows the accuracy curve of the proposed approach for the two data settings when varying the amount of unlabeled data from 0 to 20,000 instances . We see that the performance of the proposed approach improves steadily by adding more and more unlabeled data . However , even with only 2,000 unlabeled sentence pairs , the proposed approach still produces large performance gains.
5.3 Results on Pseudo-Parallel Unlabeled
Data
As discussed in Section 3.4, we generate pseudo-parallel data by translating the monolingual sentences in each setting using Google?s machine translation system . Figures 3 and 4 show the performance of our model using the pseudo-parallel data versus the real parallel data , in the two settings , respectively . The EN->CH pseudo-parallel data consists of the English unlabeled data and its automatic Chinese translation , and vice versa.
Although not as significant as those with parallel data , we can still obtain improvements using the pseudo-parallel data , especially in the first setting.
The difference between using parallel versus pseudo-parallel data is around 24% in Figures 3 and 4, which is reasonable since the quality of the pseudo-parallel data is not as good as that of the parallel data . Therefore , the performance using pseudo-parallel data is better with a small weight ( e.g . = 0.1) in some cases.

We use only the translated labeled data to train classifiers , and then directly classify the test data.
The average accuracies in setting 1 are 66.61% and 63.11% on English and Chinese , respectively ; while the accuracies in setting 2 are 58.43% and 54.07% on English and Chinese , respectively . This result is reasonable because of the language gap between the original language and the translated language . In addition , the class distributions of the English labeled data and the Chinese are quite different (30% vs . 55% for positive as shown in
Table 1).
Figures 5 and 6 show the accuracies when varying the weight of the translated labeled data vs.
the labeled data , with and without the unlabeled parallel data . From Figure 5 for setting 1, we can see that the translated data can be helpful given the labeled data and even the unlabeled data , as long as is small ; while in Figure 6, the translated data decreases the performance in most cases for setting 2. One possible reason is that in the first data setting , the NTCIR English data covers the same topics as the NTCIR Chinese data and thus direct translation is helpful , while the English and Chinese topics are quite different in the second data setting , and thus direct translation hurts the performance given the existing labeled data in each language.
5.5 Discussion
To further understand what contributions our proposed approach makes to the performance gain , we look inside the parameters in the MaxEnt models learned before and after adding the parallel unlabeled data .

New Features Learned from Unlabeled Data and Table 4 shows the newly learned features from the unlabeled data with the largest weights.
From Table 3 10 we can see that the weight changes of the original features are quite reasonable , e.g . the top words in the positive class are obviously positive and the proposed approach gives them higher weights . The new features also seem reasonable given the knowledge that the labeled and unlabeled data includes negative news about for specific topics ( e.g . Germany , Taiwan),.
We also examine the process of joint training by checking the performance on test data and the agreement of the two monolingual models on the unlabeled parallel data in both settings . The average agreement across 5 folds is 85.06% and 73.87% in settings 1 and 2, respectively , before the joint training , and increases to 100% and 99.89%, respectively , after 100 iterations of joint training.
Although the average agreement has already increased to 99.50% and 99.02% in settings 1 and 2, respectively , after 30 iterations , the performance on the test set steadily improves in both settings until around 5060 iterations , and then becomes relatively stable after that.
Examination of those sentence pairs in setting 2 for which the two monolingual models still 10The features and weights in Tables 3 and 4 are extracted from the English model in the first fold of setting 1.
disagree after 100 iterations of joint training often produces sentences that are not quite parallel , e.g .: English : The two sides attach great importance to international cooperation on protection and promotion of human rights.
Chinese : ????,????????????????,??? ??????????????( Both sides agree that double standards on the issue of human rights are to be avoided , and are opposed to using pressure on human rights issues in international relations .) Since the two sentences discuss human rights from very different perspectives , it is reasonable that the two monolingual models will classify them with different polarities ( i.e . positive for the English sentence and negative for the Chinese sentence ) even after joint training.

In this paper , we study bilingual sentiment classification and propose a joint model to simultaneously learn better monolingual sentiment classifiers for each language by exploiting an unlabeled parallel corpus together with the labeled data available for each language . Our experiments show that the proposed approach can significantly improve sentiment classification for both languages . Moreover , the proposed approach continues to produce ( albeit smaller ) performance gains when employing pseudo-parallel data from machine translation engines.
In future work , we would like to apply the joint learning idea to other learning frameworks ( e.g.
SVMs ), and to extend the proposed model to handle word-level parallel information , e.g.
bilingual dictionaries or word alignment information . Another issue is to investigate how to improve multilingual sentiment analysis by exploiting comparable corpora.

Appendix A . Equation Deduction
In this appendix , we derive the gradient for the objective function in Equation 3, which is used in parameter estimation . As mentioned in Section 3.3, the parameters can be learned by finding : Since the first term on the righthand side is just the expression for the standard MaxEnt problem , we will focus on the gradient for the second term , and denote as ( ).
Let denote or , and be the th weight in the vector . For brevity , we drop the in the above notation , and write to denote . Then the partial derivative of (*) based on Equation 4 with respect to is as follows : (1)
Further , we obtain : (2)
Merge (2) into (1), we get :
