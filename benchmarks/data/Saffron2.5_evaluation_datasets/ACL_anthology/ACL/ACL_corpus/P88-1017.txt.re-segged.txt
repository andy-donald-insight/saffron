This paper presents a unification-based approach to Japanese honorifics based on a version of HPSG  ( Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar ) ll\]121 . Utterance parsing is based on lexical specifications of each lexical item  , including honorifics , and a few general PSG rules using a parser capable of unifying cyclic feature structures  . It is shown that the possible word orders of Japanese honorific predicate constituents can be automatically deduced in the proposed framework without independently specifying them  . 
Discourse Information Change Rules ( DICRs ) that allow resolving a class of anaphors in honorific contexts are also formulated  . 
1. Introduction
Japanese has a rich grammaticalized system of honorifics to express the speaker's honorific attitudes toward discourse agents  ( i . e . persons who are related to the discourse ) . As opposed to such written texts as scientific or newspaper articles  , where the author's rather ' neutral'honorific attitude is required  , in spoken dialogues , an abundant number of honorific expressions is used and plays an important role in resolving human zero-anaphors  . 
In this paper , a unification-based approach to Japanese honorifics is proposed  . First , Mizutani's theory of honorific expression actl3\] is introduced to define basic honorific attitude types used in specifying pragmatic on straints on the use of Japanese honorifics  . Then a range of honorifics are classified into subtypes from a morphological and syntactico -semantic perspective and examples of their lexical specifications are shown  . The main characteristics of the utterance parser and an approach to explaining possible word orders of honorific predicate constituents are described  . 
Finally , Discourse Information Change Rules are formulated that resolve a class of anaphors in honorific contexts  . 
2 . Speaker's Honorific Attitudes toward Discourse 
Agents 2 . 1 . Grammatical Aspects of Honorifics A distinction must be made between the speaker's honorific attitude as determined by the utterance situation  ( the social relationship between discourse agents , the atmosphere of the setting , etc ) , and the honorific attitude as expressed by special linguistic means independent of the ? utterance situation  . For example , by violating a usage principle for the determination of an honorific attitude  ( i . e . 
" one should not exalt oneself in front of others " )  , uses of an honorific expression about the speaker himself can function as a kind of joke  . However , without he help of grammatical properties of honorifics independent of particular utterance situations  , the violation of a usage principle itself could not be recognized at all  , thus the expression could not function as a joke . Though the former situational determination of honorific attitude is an interesting subject matter for socio and psycholinguistic researchers  , the latter grammatical properties of hot ~ orifics are our concern here and what is described with lexical specifications for honorifics  . 
2 . 2 . Mizutani's Theory of Honorific Expression Act Mizutani's theory of honorific expression act is introduced to define basic honorific attitude types that stipulate the pragmatic on straints on Japanese honorifics  . In this model , discourse agents are positioned in an ~ bstract two-dimens lonal honorific space  ( Fig .  1) . How they are positioned is a socio and psycholinguistic problem  , which is not pursued here .

Fig 1. Honorific Space
An honorific expresson act reflects the configuraion of these discourse agent points  . The speaker is set as the point of origin , and the speaker's honorific attitude toward a discourse agent  , say P , is defined as the position vector of point P . The speaker's honorific attitude toward agent P relative to agent Q is defined as a vector from point Q to point P  . The value and the direction of the vector are defined as follows : for v =  ( x . y ) , the honorific value of a vector v ( written as IvJ ) is defined as:
Ivl = y iff x = 0; 0 iff x ~0;
Honorific Direction : a . upI , t > 0, b . downIvi < O , c . flatIv ~ = O and x = O , d . across Ivl = 0 and x ~ O . 
IN . B . JAs suming an honorific space to be two dimensional  ( not one dimensional )  , an across direction can be distinguished from a fi at direction  . 
An acros S direction of a vector corresponds to the case where no positive honorific relation between the two agents  ( i . e . up , down , or flat ) is recognized by the speaker . 
Though the speaker's honorific attitudes can be characterized from several viewpoints  ( e . g . up/down , distant/close , formal/informal ) , Mizutani's model is appropriate for describing Japanese honorifics because the up ~ down aspect most relevantly characterizes Japanese honorifics  . Moreover , it is not clear how the other aspects are independently grammaticalized in the Japanese honorific system  . 
Based on the direction of the vector defined above  , the following four subtypes of honorificatti tude relations are distinguished  . 
Honorific Attitude Type : a . honor-up b . honor-downc . honor-flate . honor-across 3 . Description of Japanese Honorifics 3 . 1 . Classification of Japanese Honorifi cs  3  . 1 . 1 . Morphological Viewpoint In Japanese , words in a wide range of syntactic categories ( i . e . nouns , verbs , adjectives , nominal-verbs , nominal-adjectives , etc ) are systematically put into their honorific forms  . They are classified into two subtypes according to how they are derived from their nonhonorific forms  . 
Classification by the lexical derivation type : honorific-word = a  . regular-form-honorific-word ( e . g . " ookak-i " from " kak-i "\[ write v inf\] ) \[ HP-\[write vstem-CS inf \] lb . irregular-form-honorific-word ( e . g . " ossyar-"from"iw-"\[speakvstem\])N . B . \] HP and CS stand for ' Honoric Prefix ' and ' Conjugation Suffix ' respectively  . Words is transcribed in its phonemic representation  . 
While regular-form honorific words share a common base with their nonhonorific forms because they are derived by the productive honorific -affixation process  , irregular-form honorific words have special word forms that have no direct connection to their nonhonorific forms  . This distiction plays an important role in the lexical specification of honorifics and in possible word orders of Japanese honorific predicate constituents  . 
3 . 1 . 2 . Syntactico-Semantic Viewpoint In traditional school grammar  , Japanese honorifics have been classified into three categories : respect words  ( ' sonkeigo ' )  , con descending words (' kenjougo ') , and polite words (' teineigo') . However , in this traditional tripartite class if ication  , common features of respect-words and condescending-words not shared by polite-words are not explicit  . That is , while an agent toward whom the speaker's honorific attitude is expressed must be grammatically located in the sentence  ( i . e . as subject or object ) in the case of respector condescending words , this requirement does not apply to polite words . Thus a more elaborate classification is adopted . 
Conventional terms are replaced by Haradal4l ' s more syntactico-semantically motivated ones . 
Classification by the syntactic role of an aqent to whom the speaker's honorific attitude is expressed : honorific-word = a  . propositional-honorific-word = a .  1 . subject-honorific-word ( respect-word ) ( e . g . " kudaser-u "\ [ give~nf \]) a . 2 . object-honorific-word(condescendiog-word ) ( e . g . " sesiage-ru " l give v ~ ef \]) b . performative-honorific-word ( polite-word ) ( e . g . ' des-u ', ' mas-u ') IN . B . \] For example , a verb which takes a nonanimete subject ( e . g . " fur-u " in the sentece " Ame ( rain ) ga ( SBJ ) fur-u ( fall )  . ? I The rainfal b . \] ) can be put into its performative honorific form ( ' A megafur-imas-u . ') , but not into its subject honorific form ( * " Antegao-for-tninaru . ') . This is in accordance with the difference between propositional honorifics and performative honorificl  . 
IN . B . \] There are a class of words which function in between the a  . 2 and b types of honorifics ( e . g . "mair-u "\[ go/come ~\] in " Basugamair-imas - u  . "\[A bus will come . \]) . Let us call them propositional-perform at tve-word l . 
Minus-honorifics are givenno place in the tradit ional tripartite classification  . However , they are classified in our approach as correponding to the expressed honorific attitude types  . 

Classification by the expressed honorific attitude type : honorific-word = a  . plus-honorific-word ( e . g . " aw-a-re-ru "\[ meet regular . sbjhon \])\ [ . , . meet ~ tem'CS vong\]-PlusHonAuxv~tem-CS aml\]b . minus-honorific-word ( e . g . " aw-i-yagar-u "\[ meet regular-sbjhon\])\[\[ . . . meet ~ em-C$1 nf-Minus Hon Aux ~ tm-CSm ~ JINB . \] The Japanese honorific system has no systematized means to positively express honor -flator honor-across honorific attitudes  . Annonh on orific plain wordform may express honor -flathon orific attitudes to werda discourse agent in a situation such as speaking to an old friend  , while it may express honor-across honorific attitudes in a situation such as writing a technical paper  . 
Because the classfications of honorifics from different viewpoints as summarized above are cross-categorical  , and thus independent of one another , a single honorific word ( e . g . " hozak-u "\[ say vsenf\] ) can function at the same time as irregular-form -honorific-word  , subject-honorific-word , and minus-honorific-word . 
3 . 2 . A Unification-based Lexical Approach A unification-based lexicalism approach is adopted here for describing Japanese honorifics for the following reasons :  ( a ) a unification-based approach enables the integrated description of information from various kinds of sources  ( syntax , semantics , etc ) , thus allowing their simultaneous analysis ;   ( b ) a lexical approach helps to increase the modularity of grammar  . In this approach , a grammar has only a small number of general syntactic rule schemata and most of grammatical information is to be specified in a lexicon  . 
Linguistic word class generalizations can be formed by making grammatical categories complex by representing them with feature-structures  . 
The specification of verbal category honorifics is important because the verbal categories are the most productive in the honorification process  , and thus appropriate to clearly show how diverse aspects of the Japanese honorific system are described in this approach  . 
3 . 3 . Examples of lexical specifications 3 . 3 . 1 . Regular-Form Honorifics Subject Honorification by " Vvong +  ( ra ) re-ru " Regular for mhonorifics are compositionally analyzed by giving lexical specifications for each honorific-word formation formative  . For example , most plain-form verbs can be put into their simple subject-plus-honorific form by postpositioning the auxiliary verb "  ( ra ) re-ru " to them ( ' reru " and " rare-ru " are allomorphs of a single morpheme  )  . 
Lexical information for these formatives is specified in the feature structure :\[\[ orth  ( orthography ) ? orth\]\[head\[\[pos ( part-or-speech ) v\]\[ctype ( conJugaton-type ) vowel\]\[cform ( conJugatton-rorm ) stem\]I\]\[adjacent?prod\]\[subcat ( ?sbJ\[\[haad\[\[posp\]\[grf ( grmmaticel-functton ) sbJ\]\]\]\[subcat0 ) \[ sam?sbJ sem\]\[sear\[\[huNn+\]\]\]\]? prad\[\[heed\[\[posv\]\[ctype?predctype\ ]\ [ c forllvong  ( vofce-nagattva ) \]\[ subcet~sbJ\]\[sea ? predsem\]\] ) \]\[ Sam ? preds am\]\[prsg\[\[restrs\ [\[ relnhonor-up \]\[ origine speak are\ ]\ [ goal TshJsem\]\]  ) \]\]\]\] ) where < ? orth ? pradctypa > E ( <' ra " cons > <' rB re " ( : or vowel kuru suru ) > ) Fig 2 . Lexical Specification for a simple subject-plus honorification morpheme  ( ' ( ra ) re-ru ' ) IN . g , \] ? ~ a prefix for a tag-name used to represent a token identity of feature-~ru ~ ures  . * Speaker * is a special global variable bound to a feature stru~ure representing the speaker's information  . 
The ' prag ' feature describes the pragmatic constraint on this expression  ( the " honor-up " relationship from the speaker to the subject agent of the predicate is required for this expression to be used in a pragmatically appropriate way  )  . Description with the ' honor-up ' honorific attitude relation shows that this expression is a ' plus-honorific'expression  . Structure-sharing of the ' goal ' feature value of this honorif cattitude relation with the semantic value of the predicate's subject shows that this expression is a ' subject-honorific ' expression  . The requirement for the ' or th ' feature value ( ? ' orth ) and the ' ctype ' value in the ' subcat ' feature  ( ? predctype ) describes the morphophone mi characteristic of this morpheme by stipulating that ' re-  ( ru ) ' subcategorize for either a regular consonant -stem ctype verb or an irregular ctype verb  ( ' suru'\[do\] )  , and that ' rare- ( ru ) ' subcategorize for either a regular vowel-stem ctype verb or an irregular ctype verb  ( ' kuru'\[come\] )  , correctly allowing ( la ) and ( lc ) but not fib ) .

The ' adjacent ' feature is a special feature which assures that its value be the first element in the list when the set description in the ' subcat'value is expanded into list descriptions by a rule reader  . The specification of this feature implies that this morph is a bound morph and thus requires its adjacent element to be realized as a nonnull phonetic form  . 
Though the set description in the ' subcat'value is introduced to allow word order variation among complement daughters in Japanese  , without this kind of specification , ungrammatical sequences such as ( ld ) are also allowed for auxiliariy verbs . 
\[N . B . ) A set description in the subcat feature of a feature sturucture  , \[ ladjacent ? c\]\[subcatETa?b?c)\] , for example , is expanded into its corresponding two possible list descriptions by a rule reader as follows : I \[ adjacent  7c  ) \[ subcat ( : or < 7 c ? b ? a > < ? c ? a ? b > ) \] . Furthermore , < ? c?b?a > . for example , is expanded into a feature structure such as \[ Jfirst?c\]\[rest\[Ifirst  7bnrest Il first ? a\]\[restend\]\] . 
Object Honorification by " HP + Vinf+suru " Next  , let us consider a more complicated formation pattern for deriving a regular object-plus -honorific form  . As productive as the above " V vong + ( ra ) re-ru " pattern is , an " HP+Vinf+suru " pattern can put most verbs with two grammatical human arguments into their corresponding object honorific forms as follows : " o + aw-i + suru " from " aw -"  ( meet v stem )  , " go+shoukai+suru " from " shoukai " ( introduce-verse )  . 
IN . B . \]" o , " and " go -" are two forms of ssingle morpheme ( honorific prefix ) that is prefixed to words in a variety of syntactic categories  ( See Appendix I )  . The choice depends on the following element's origin  . If the element is a Sine-Japanese morpheme ( kango )  , the honor if c prefix takes the form " go -' ; if it is a native one , the honorific prefix is realized as " o-' , though there are exceptions . 
In a naive analysis of Japanese honorifics , these honorific forms derive from their corresponding plain forms by a simple object honorification lexical rule that does not take into account their internal constituent structures  ( e . g . " aw-u "--) " o-aw-i-suru ') . Accordingly , this kind of naive analysis is inadequate for the following reasons : Ca  ) it is arguable that " HP+Vinf " forms a unit in some structural level before forming the unit " HP+Vinf+suru '  , considering the existence of such construct ions as " lIP+Vinf+ni+nar-u "  ( normal-sbj-plus-hon-form )   , " HP+Vinf+negaw-u(request ) ' , and " HP+Vinf+itadak-u ( receive-favorirregular . obj . plus . hon . form )' , but this assertion is not explicitly illustrated in a naive  ana4~sis   ;   ( b ) though some adverbial postpositions such as " we "  ( contrastive )  , " me " ( also ) and " sae " ( even ) can appear inside the object honorific form ( e . g . " o-aw-i-WA-suru ' , " go-shoukai-SAE-MO-suru ') , it is difficult to derive these forms by a naive analysis in light of the generalization concerning adverbial postpositions appearing in other environments  ( e . g . " Senseigakyoosi tuDAKE e WAko rare ta "\[ the teacher came only to the class room \]  )  ;   ( c ) a naive analysis fails to explain the kind of the elements that can operate as a Vinf element in the pattern  , which is automatically explained in the proposed framework as will be shown in section  5  . 
This regular object-plus-honorificat ion process is compositionally analyzed in the proposed framework by giving each of its formatives a lexical specification  , in the same manner as the " Vvong + ( ra ) re-ru " pattern subject-plus-honorific analysis . 
Here the expression " o-aw-i-suru " is an alized . Fig 3 . are presents the lexical information of the verb " aw -'  ( meet ) in its infinitive form ( ' aw-i ' )   .

Fig 3. C . Honorific prefixation rule
IN . B . i The rule stated in an extended version of PATR41 notation consists of two parts ; CFG-part and constraints . CFG-part is used to propose an efficient topdown expectation in the parser  . Constraints are required for the rule application to end successfully  . Here , all constraints are described by equations of two feature structures  . ?<>" is used to denote a feature structure path , and ? ,   , " to denote a token identity relation between two feature structures  . 

The ' headl coh ( Category Of Head ) ' feature of a category specifies the kind of its head  . An HP can take a lexical infinitive-form verb whose ' can-take-hp'value is '+'  . An HP is assign edits appropriate realization form  (  . ) ( in this case , " o " form ) , because its ' orth ' value and the head's' hp form ' value are the same  . The first equation in the rule statement prevents a second application of the honorific prefixation rule to the same verb  ( *' o-o-aw-i ? ) by specifying that them other category's'can -take-hp ' feature value be  ,  . ,  ( ** ) The other equations in the rule are ones common to the adjunct-head structures  . 
I*N . B . \] A note is needed here concerning the realization of Hr  . When the adjacent feature of the second right -hand-side symbol in the CFG-part is nilas in the above case  , it is enough just to concatenate both ' orth ' feature values of the right-hand-side symbols and make it the ' or th ' feature value of the left -hand-side symbol  . However . when the head element's adjacent feature has a nonnull value  ( i . e . in the case that the head element is n bound morph  ) o a more complicted operation is needed . But here we only mention its necessity and avoid its precise formulation to save space  . 
I**N . BJThe'can-take-hp ' feature is specified as '-' not only for already HP-prefixed elements  , but also for almost all irregular form honorific verbs  ( e . g . 
*' o-osshar-i ' lsay \] , *' o-it a dak-i'l receive * favor D and most mono -synablic infinitive-form verbs that have corresponding irregular-form honorifics  ( e . g . 
*' o-si"\[doJ,*'o-mi"\[lookatJ).
Next , the usual complement-head structure rule ( Fig 3 . d ) is applied to the resulting feature structure for " o-aw-i " and the feature structure for a normal object-plus honorification formative  ( '- suru ' , as shown in Fig 3 . e ) . Thus the normal object plus honorifcform ( ' o-aw-i- ( suru ) ' ) for " aw-'\[meet\]is obtained in a composition alway  . 
(derrule m -> ( ch )   ( (0 heed > -- <2 head > )   ( <1> --  ( : ftrst < 2 subcat > )   ( (0 subcat > - - ( : rest < 2 subcat > ) )  ( (0 sam > -- <2 sam > )   ( <0 pragrest rs > ( : union ( 1 pragrest rs > ( 2 pragrest rs > ) ) ) Fig 3 . d .

Irregular Form Honorifics Irregular form honorifics share most of their lexical information with their nonhonorific counterparts  . In our framework , redundant lexical specification for irregular -form honorifics is avoided by using lexical inheritance mechanism from their superclass as  . For example , the necessary lexical specification for the irregular subject honorific form "  ( - te ) it a dak-"of the donatory auxiliary verb " ( - te ) moraw-"is reduced , as shown in Fig 4 . a . This turns out to be equivalent to Fig 4 . b by unifying pieces of information from its superclasses  , te-receive-favor and obj-plus-hon .

4. Unification-based CFG Parser
Fig 5 shows the organization of the unification-based CFG parser  . The parser is essentially based on Earley's algorithm  , and unifies feature structures in its completion process  . The description of grammatical rules and lexical items are complied into feature structures by the rule reader  . 
Unification of cyclic feature structuers might be necessary to analyze certain expressions  . To give some examples : ( a ) frozen honorific words such as " o-naka " ( belly ) and " go-ran " ( to look at ) must always be prefixed by an HP ( the element in boldface )  ;   ( b ) the polite form ( ' gozar -' ) of the verb " ar -'/' ir -" ( to be ) almost always needs to be followed by the polite honorific auxiliary verb "- masu " in modern Japanese  .

Organization of the Unification-based Parser In describing the above linguistic phenemena  , it is convenient if requirements f . or its head category can be specified not only for adjunct elements  , but also for complement elements .

The extended algorithm can unify cyclic feature structures while avoiding unnecessary overcopying of feature stuructures  . 
5 . Word Order of Honorific Predicate Consti tuents In Japanese  , a verbal predicate is composed of one main verb and postpositioned auxiliary verbs  ( though possibly none exist )  . Because both main verbs and auxiliary verbs may have honorific forms  , various sequences of honorifics might be expected to occur in a predicate as a simple matter of possible combinations  . However , their possible word orders are restricted by a grammatical principles  . Traditionally , possibile word orders were described in detail and the s 

Fig 6 . Cyclic part of the compiled feature structure perspective  . In this research , it is shown how possible word orders can be deduced from lexical specifications of honorifics  . 
5 . 1 . Propositional and Performative Honorifics A propositional honorific formative always precedes a performative honorific formative  . For example , though " a wa-re-masu " ( \[\[\[\[ meetvong\]-SbjPIusHon\]-PerformativeHon\] ) and " o-awi-si-masu " ( \[\[\[\[ HP-meet vlnf\]-ObjPlus HonJ-Performative Hon \]  ) are possible expressions , they would be impossible if their word orders were reversed  ( i . e . 
performative honorific placed before proposit ional honorific  )  . 
This restriction on word order is considered a consequence of the lexical specifications for both types of honorifics  . As shown in section 3 , propositional honorification formatives subcategorize a verbal category whose subject  ( and object ) elements are not filled yet as its adjacent element  . On the other hand , a performative honorification formative subcategorizes a verbal category with saturated subcategorization  . This represents the lexical specification for " mesu ?  . 
\[\[ orth "'\]\ [ heed\[\[posv\]\[ctype musu\ ]\ [ c for llstem \]  \[4rrugullr-cforlu \[\[senfmesu\] . . . \]\]\]\]\[ cen-tlko-hp-\]\[adjacent?prod\] \[ subcut ? prud\[\[heud\[\[posv\]\[c formusu\ ]\]\]\[suhcet  ( \]\[ sea?predsum\]\]\]J\[sims?prudsms\]\[ prig\[\[restrs\[\[relnhonor-up\]\[ordgdn Ospuakure \]  loom1 * hem . re\]\]\]\]\]\]Fig7 . Lexical Specification for a performative honorification formative " masu " The performative honorificaton formative " masu " cannot  , therefore , immediately precede a propositional honorification formative due to the requirement concerning the adjacent element of propositional honorifics  . The opposite order , however , constitutes a syntactically legitimate structure . 
5.2. Subject and Object Honorifics
An object honorific formative must precede a subject honorific formative  , though there is an important class of exceptions ( verbs that subcategorizea'te ' form verb as an adjacent element such as "  ( - te ) it a dak-'\[receive-favor\] )  . For example , " o-awi-sa-reru " ( \[\[\[\[ HP-meet vtnf\]-ObjPlusHon-SbjPIusHon\] ) is a possible word order , but " o-a wa-re-suru " ( \[\[ HP-\[meetvong-SbjPlusHon\]\]-ObjPlusHon\] ) i not possible if "- re ( ru ) " is used as an honorification formative . This word order restriction can be explained in the same way as for the above case : that is  , as shown in section 3 , the normal object honorification formative % suru " subcategorizes a verb whose subject and object are not yet filled  . The simple subject honor float on formative "- ( ra ) reru " that requires its object to be already fil led cannot  , therefore , precede the normal subject plus honorific at ionformative on account of conflicting specifications for the ' subcat ' value  . Otherwise , no conflict exist . 
Other kinds of restrictions on the possible word order of Japanese honorific predicate constituents can likewise be explained in the proposed framework  . 
6 . Anaphora Resolution in Honorific Contexts In Japanese honorific contexts  , many human anaphors can be resolved by recourse to pragmatic constraints on the use of honorifics  . This is an attempt to apply DR theory to the anaphora resolution in Japanse honorific contexts  . 
Discourse information is represented by a feature structure consisting of a set of reference markers  ( Universe ) and a set of conditions , as in the standard version of DR ( Discourse Representation ) theory l7\] . Fig 8 . a is the initially posited DRS ( Discourse Representation Structure )  . Addition of other discourse information to the initial ORS does not affect the theory  .

"Once when ACL-88 was held . Imet ( object-honorific and performative-honorific ) a ertain famous computational linguist . ? From this , Fig 8 . b is unified as its semantic/pragmatic information  . The method of specifying necessary lexical information was briefly explained in section  3  . 
The initial discouse information is updated by the semantic/pragmatic information of a new utterance as follows : First  , DICR 1 , shown in Fig 9 . a below , is applied to the semantic value of a new utterance  . DICR2 is then applied to the pragmatic value . Meanwhile , anaphoric expressions in a new utterance are resolved so that the NFCIS shown in Fig  9  . b below is observed .

Resulting Semantic Information for ( 3b ) Because the index 7x18 for " song keisan-gengo gaku-sha " ( that computational linguist ) has a \] familiarity '+\] attribute based on the lexical specification for ' song '  , an attempt is made to resolve it by unifying 7x16 with an element of the kluniv value , requiring that their restrictions can also be unified  . It stands to reason that it can be resolved because  7x16 and 7x02 are , semantically speaking , unifiable , because their semantic restrictions are \[\] rein ' computational-linguist\]!instance  7x16\]\] and\[\[\[reln'computational-linguist\ ] l instance ?  x02\]\] Ilreln'famous ) \[ instance ? x02\]\] ) respectively , and their variable types are both ' individual ' , which causes no incompatibility . However , their pragmatic restrictions ( llreln ' honor-down Jlagent % peeker * ) lob\]act 7x16\] \[\[ reln " honor-upJlagent % peaker*\]lobject " hearer *\]\]  , and ( \[ reln'honor-up ) \[ agent * speaker * ) lob\]act ? x02\]\] \] It*In'honor-up\]iagent*speeker*\]lobject* hearer *  ) l ) prevent ? x16 from being unified with ? x02 , due to the stipulation ' llreln ' honor-up\]\ [ agent ? ail object ? b\]\]A\[I reln'ho nor -down  ) \[ agent ? el \] object ? b ) \]- bottom ' . This anaphoric resolution therefore fails . Other ways of resolving this anaphoric expression also fail because of the incompatibility of their variable types or semantic features  . In any case , utterance ( 3b ) turns out to be in felicitous by NFC . 
Unlike (3b ) , utterance (3b ') , whose sem/prag values are the same as Fig8 . cexcept for\[\[rein'honor-up ) \[ agent * speaker * ) lob\]act ? x16\]\] instead of \[\] rein'hon or-down ) \[ agent * speaker * ) \] object ? x16\]\] , can be given a felicitous reading , because anaphora resolution is possible without violating

($b ~ Though many issues rermain unaddressed concerning anaphora resolution in Japanese honorific contexts  , these can be approached by use of the proposed model  . This model regards discourse understanding as the process of unifying various kinds of partial information  , including contextual information . 
7. Condusion
A unification-based approach to Japanese honorifics based on a version of HPSG was proposed  . Utterance parsing is based on the lexical specifications of a range of honorifics using a parser capable of unifying cyclic feature structures  . 
The developed parser constitutes an important part of NADINE  ( NAtural Dialogue INterpretationExpert )  , an experimental system which translates JapaneseEnglish telephone and inter-keyboard ialogues  .
