While both theoretical and empirical studies of question-answering have revealed the inadequacy of traditional definitions of V e*-no questions  ( YNQs )  , little progress has been made toward a more satisfactory redefinition  . This paper reviews the limitations of several proposed revisions  . It proposes a new definition of YNQs baaedup on research on a type of conversational irn  pIieature  , termed here set darimp/i e ,   , ture , that helps define appropriate responses to YNQs . 
By representing YNQs assealer q tteriee it is possible to support a wider variety of system antiuser responses in a principled way  . 
IINTRODUCTION
If natural language interfaces to question -answering systems are to support a broad range of responses to user queries  , the way these systems represent queries for response retrieval should be reexamined  . Theorists of question-answering commonly define questions in terms of the set of all their possible\[true  ) answers . 
Traditionally , they have defined t/us-no quesgiofts ( YNQs ) as propositional questions ( ? P ) or as a special type of alternative question ( ? PV ? Q )  , in which the second alternative is simply the negation of the fir  . ~t (? PV?"P ) . So ' Does Mary like skiing ? ' would be represented as flikr  ( lffary , skling ) or ? like ( Alary . okiing ) V " ~- Iikt(Mary , skiing ) and the range of appropriate responses wouhl be gee  , no and , possibly , unknown . 
?" i lowever , both theoretle alwn rk and empirical studies of naturally occurring question-answer x changes have shown this approach to be inadequate : ?~ s  ,   . o . and unknown form only a small portion of the set  ?  , fall appropriate responses to a YNQ . Furthermore , for some YNQ's . none of these simple direct responses alone i ~ appropri :  , te . 
While it is widely recognized ( llobbs ,  1979 , Pollack , 1982 that indirect resp . nses I to YNQs represent an important option for respondents in natural discourse  , standard theories of question-answering haven , ~t been revised accordiugly . A practical COllsPquence surface ~ when attempts are made t  . o support indirect responses to YNQs computationally  . For lack of alternative representations , question-answering systems which would permit indirect responses must still represent YNQs as if the direct respons-swere the ' norm '  , and then resort to adhoemanipulations to generate second-class ' indirect ' responses  , thus perpetuating an asymmetric distinction between ' direct ' and ' indirect ' responses  . 
However . resea . ' hunder way on how a type of generalized conversational implie at ttre  , termed here scalar irrt plieature , can be used to guide the generation and iater pretion of indirect respt  , nses to YNQs sugges/ , s are vi~ed representation f i ) rYNQs which scrotums ) dates a wide variety of responses in a uniform way . 
IICURRENTREPRESENTATIONSOFYNQ , S
Amongst : ~ ad: , rd accounts of ? NQs , I-lintikka's(l . lh:tik . ~ a ,  197~ ) is one of the shnl ) lest and mo~t widely accepted , c  ~ . ,mbinh~g the llndirect r~sponses to YNQs tr ~ defined h ~: reas responses other than lltR  , n0 , or some expression of ignorance . 
concepts of YNQ " as pn , positional question " and as alternative question ; as such , it will be used below to represent raditional approaches in general  . To define at ts werhood , the conditions under which a response on nts as an answer to a natural language query  , Hintikka divide sqneriq ~ s into two parts : an imperative or optaGve operator \ [  )  . roughly expressing ' bri , git about that ' , and a daesider at u ~ , n , a specification of the epistemie state a questhmer desires  . For Hintikka , a YNQ is a ~ peciai case of alterna ( Jve question in which the negative alternative ' or not P ' has been suppressed  . So the desideratum of a YNQ is of the f?~rm ( \[know thai P ) VIk in , u , that  #t~3 + P . where net-l-indicates the negation-fi ) rming process . ' Does Mary like skiing ?' thus has a . sits desideratum I know that , ~ htrgli \]; e . * skiing or Ikno ~ i hat Aiary does not like skiing  , or , more concisely , fK  ~ Jike Marg , skling ) VKs ~ likc ' Marll , ekiing ) , where KS is the epistemic represent a titm of ' S knows that '  . The full sense of the query is then ' Bring it a boot that  1 know that Mary likes skiing or that I know that Mary does not like skiing '  , which can be represented by !\[ KsPVK . ~',P) . 
Possible resp . nses are simply P ,-, P , or yes , no) . 
A.t I_~othesls Confirmation
Bolingcr ( Boliuger ,  1978 ) has called such interpretations into question by showing that YNQs may have very different meanings from their altern at lve-questio a counterparts  ; they also have more restricted paraphrase and intonation patterns  . In 13oliuger's view the term I/US-noqtterl/hashypnolized scholars into a  . ssurrling that , simply because a class of question can be answered by a  2us or no , the ~ altern:ttives are critcrial , and every YNQ is intended to elicit , one or the other . He proposes instead that YNQs be viewed as hypotheses put forward for confirmation  , arn cadmen Lordise on firn la don-in any degree . Thus , in Bolinger's exampie ( l) , the (1) Q : Do you likello noln lu ?
R : Just a little.
questioner(Q )' shypothesis'you like tloaoh , i u ' is a mended by ~ he respondent ( R ) in are . -ponsev , hich is neither . t , esn , ~ rnobnt somewhere in between . In his example (2) , Q's hypothesis ' it is (2) Q : Is it difficult ?
R : It's impose S'de.
difficult ' is confirmed by R's as , ertion of a more positive resi~onse than a simple go  . ; . 
While Boling cr makes a good ca ' . : . e for the inadequacy of sttm dard views of YNQs , the revisi , mhvI ) mposes is itself : , ~ , \] i , tited . ' ~ t ', ~ imp ~, ~ ible ', in (2) . d .

And ther , ~ are equally appropriate responses to the queries in  ( l ) and 2 ) that are not easily explained in terms of degree of hypotl ~ es is confirm at it  , n , u . ~ showniu (3) and (4) .

Similarly , Ki , ' fer(Kid , for , 19 ~; 0) points out evidence for the inad t , quacy of the standard view of YNQs , but proposes no unified so hrti . n . In astt ~ dy of the indirect speech acts that may be p ~  . rh~rm , ' dI , ?"( NQ ~ , h , " nc~le ~ that certain YNQs , which he terms . focussed Y TVQs , a etu : dly function as v , h-queslions .

For example , ( Sa ) is not a focussed YNQ while Y ~ bHY , d ) are . While any of the four may be auswrted with 9~ , ~ ora .  1 . ~ John h , aving for . ~ tock holm tomorrow ? b . Is .

'  ; and if sheasks ( Sd ) she may want to know ' Who is leaving for Stockhohn tomorrow ? " Titus af  , ~cussed YNQ resemhles the wh-question that might be formed by replacing the focussed element in the desideratum with a corresponding Pro -element  . In Kiefer's analysis , only one eh't~ent can he focussed , so resl~mses such as ' lie's leaving for Paris Thursday ' will not be accommodated  . 
Although Kiefer does not propose a representation for focugsed YNQs  , a d i . .:j , nc ! resembling the desideratum of a wh-question might I  , e added to the traditional representation to are ommodate histhird : tlter naive : for  ( 5d  this might take the form ' Is John leaving for Stoekhohn tomorrow  , or , if not , who is ?' or , in
Hintikka's notation , ! KQ leaving ( . Iohn , Stockholm , tomorrow ) VK q-leaving . Iohn , Stoekh-Ira , tomorrow ) V3 xK qleaving(x , Stoekholm , tomorrow) . 
This represenl . atiou reflects another problem posed by Kiefer's analysis : the third disjunet is appropriate only when the second also is and not when the direct response ~ lesis true  . For example , a response of ' Billis ' to ( Sd ) seems to convey that Johnh not leaving for Stockho hatomorrow  . Thus viewing some YNQs as wh*qm ,, qions req . ires a rather more coml~lex representation than simply adding a wh-question as a third disjunct  . * In addition , defining different representations for various YNQ subtype seems ale~s than satisfactory solution to tbel in fitations presented by current representations of YNQs  . A more unified solution to the problems identified by Bolinger and Kiefer would clearly be desirable  . Such a solution is suggested by current research on the role conversational implieature plays in accounting for indirectre  . ~ pons~stoYN ~ . ~)s . 
IIICONVERSATION ALI'MPLICATURE ANDY NQS In a large cl:~sofin  , ! irect respon : ~ e . ~ to YNQs , query and response a chrefi , r to an entity , attribute , state , activity , or event that can boviewed as appearing on sorae e e a ~ e  ; such references " Inf~et , the third di~jon~t would have to be something like ~ KQ-~leaving  ( Jol , n , ~3oekholm , to~ , ~ , ~ rrou , Atea ~ ingfz . Sterkl~olm,tomorrow) . 
a The idea . ~ outlined in the following section are discussed in more detail in  ( tlir , ~ rhberg ,  1984) . 
will be termed scalars and responses in such exchanges will be termed scalar responnes  , In such scalar exchanges , questioners can infer both a direct response and additional implicit information flor a the unreqm 'sted information provided by the respondent  . In 0) for example , Q is entitled to infer the direct response no or Id on " ~ know  ( 6 ) Q : Are mush rooms poisonous ?
R : Some are.
and the additional information that It believes that there may be mush rooms that are not poisonous  , ew , n though 3z ( rnashroom ( z ) Apoism ~ ous ( x ) ) does not IogicMly i- , van ) " of this information . 
Clearly ' Some are ' is an appropriater, . ~ pouse to the query-more appropriate in fact than a simple no  , wllich might convey that . no mush rooms are poisonous-but what makes it appropriate ? Grire's  ( Grice , 1975) Cooperative Principle claims that , without contrary evide ~ cp , participants in convers ~ . tion assume their partners are trying to be cooperative  . In consequence , they recognize certain conversational maxims , such as Grice's Mnzirn . 
of Quantitlu IMake youre outribution as informative as is required  ( for the current purposes of the exchange )  . 
b ) Do not make your contribution more informative than is required  . 
and his ~, ~ azintol QuoJity
Try to make your contribution one that is true.
a ) Do not say what you believe to be false.
b ) Do not . say that for which you I~k adequate evidence . 
Speaker and hearer's mutual recognition of these maxims may give rise to e ort ~ ersct tional ~ mp ~ ieature n : An utterance e onveraatios ~ allllint p ~ i cates a proposition P when it conveys P by virtue of the bearer's assumption of the speaker 's cooperativeness  . Whiles speaker may not always obey the ~ emaxims , the hearer's expectations are based on her belief that such conventions represent he norm  . 
A . Scalar Predeatlon
Following Grice , Hornflora , 1972) observed that , when a speaker refers to a value on some scale defined by eentant l  , " entaiment 4 , that value represents the highest value on its scale the speaker can truthful ! y affirm  . The speaker is saying as much Quantity ) as she truthfully ( Quality ) can . Higher values on that scale are thus implicitly marked by the speaker as not known to be the case or known not to be the ease  .   5 Values lower on the scale will of course be marked as true  , since they are entailed . 
Horn called this phenomenon scalar predleation , and Gazdar Gazdar ,  1979 ) later used a variation as the basis for a phenomenon hetermed sea/at quantity irrt p\ [ ieature  . Here a much revi~d and extended version will be termed scalar implleature  . 
Horn's simple notion of scalar predication does provide a principled ba  . ~ is for interpreting ( 3 ) attd similar indirect responses to YNQs where scales are defined by entailment  . Some is the highest value on a quantifier scale that R can truthfully affirm  . 
Truth ? values of higher scalars such as all are either unknown to Rorbelieved by him to be false  . Thus , if Q recognizes R's implieature , roughly , ' As far as 1 know , not all mush rooms are poisonous ' , she will derive the direct response to her query as no or I don ~ know  . H must believe either that some mush rooms are not poisonous or that some mush rooms may not be poisonous  . 
4W semantieMly entails Tiff T is true whenever W is  . 
5Whether x speaker implicates ignorance or falsity of ? value is t subject of ~ ome disagreement ? merit Ilorn and those  ( Gasdar , lg 7 g , So~mes , 1082) who h ? vetakenuphisbasic notion , In ( ltirschberg ,  1984 ) I contend that such implieatures should be viewed as didunctions  , K(~T)V ~ K(T ) , which may be dbamhiguated by the nature of the ordering relation or by the context  . 
49 d ?
It is also important onote that , in (6) , were R simply to deny Q's query or to assert ignora ~ ce with a simple\[don't know  , Q would be entitled , by virtue of the Cooperative Principle , to assume that there is no scalar value whose truth R can in fact affirm  . That is , Q can assume that , as far as R knows , there are no mush rooms that are poisonous , for otherwise R could commit himself to the proposition that ' some mush rooms are poisonous '  . 
More generally then , 1-~ is obliged by the Cooperative Principle , and more especially by Joshi's ( Josh ,  1982 ) modification of Grice's Maximel Qua / itl /: ' Do not say anything which may imply for the hearer something which you the speaker believe to be false  . ' , to provide an indirect response in (6) , lest a simple direct response entitle Q to conclude some  , fa / , eiwtplieature e . Thus indirect responses must be included among the set of all appropriate responses to a given YNQ  , since in some cases they may be the most appropriate response R can make  . 
B . Scalar Impll cature
While scalar predication provides a principled explanation for  6  )  , are vised and extended notion of a ea/ar irrt plieature can account for a much larger class of indirect responses to YNQs  . It can also suggest a revised representation f YNQs in general based upon this enlarged class of appropriate responses  . 
Order or snot defined by entailment and order rigs other than linear orderings  , including but not limited to set/set-member , whole/part , process stages , spatial relationship , prerequisite orderings , entity/attribute , leahierarchy , or temporal ordering , permit the conveyance of scalar implicatures in much the same way that the entailed quantifer scale does in  ( 6 ) ~ In ( 7 ) the set/member ( 7 ) Q : Did you invite the Reagans !
R : I invited Nancy.
(8 ~ Q : lave you finished the manuscript ?
It : I've started a roughdraft.
relati , ,nship orders the Rcagans and Nancy ; R implicates that he has not invited Ronald , for instance . In 18) , starting a roughdraft precedes finishing a manue cript in the process of preparing a paper  . SoQ is entitled to conclude that R has not finished the manuscriptor completed any later stage in this process  , such as finishing the roughdraft . 
More formally , any set of referents bl, . . . ,bn  that can be part ial ly ordered by a relation Oscan support scalar implicature  . Any scale S that permits scalar implicature can be represented as a partiallg-ordered eet  . For any referents bt , bz on S , b2 is higher on S than bI iff blOb 2 ; similarly , bI is lower on S than b ~ iff blOb ~ . Any pair b1 , b ~ of ineont parable elements ( elements not ordered with respect to one another by O  ) will be termed alternate values with respect to S  . This redefinition of scale accommodates order ors such as those mentioned above  , while excluding ordering such as cycles , that do not permit scalar implieatute . It also helps define the inferences licensed when \[ taffirms a higher or an alternate value  , or when he denies or assert signorance of lower , higher , or alternate valses . 
For example , Raffirms a higher scalar value than the value queried in Bolinger's example reproduced in  ( 2 )  . If difficult and impo . ~Mble are viewed on a scale defined ind, . grees of feasibility , then Q can conclude that by affirming ghchigher value H has affirmed the lower  . Similarly , R may affirm an alternate value , ashed ~ s in (3h . If II sees Honoluh and Hiloasb ~ , thmembers of a set of Hawaiian cities , he can affirman unqueried set member ( ltilo ) to deny a queried member llaw aii )  . The affirmati , ~n of an unqueried ah , ' rnate value generally conveys the falsity or R's ignorance of the queried value  . 
SA partial or d~-rin 9 may be defined as an irreflexive , tsymmr-trie , and transitive rel ~ . tiou . 
Speakers may also licenses calar implicat , ires by denying scalars . 
The dual to Horn's notion of affirming the highest affirmable v : due would be negating the lowest deniable scalar  . In such a denial a speaker may implicate his affirmation or ignorance of lower scalars  . So , in exchanges like 9a ) , a value higher than a queried value here , (9Q : Did you write a check for the rent ? a . R : l haven't mailed it yet . 
b . R : I haven't signed it.
c.R:I didn't pay cash.
a stage in the process of mortgage payment ) may be denied to convey the truth of the queried value  . R may also deny lower values ( gb ) or alternate vahs cs ( 9c . 
So , indirect scalar responses may be defined Ul U , na number of metrics and may involve the affirmation or negation of higher  , lower , or alternate values . They may also involve the affirmation ordenial of more than one scalar h ~ rasing le query  , as shown in (10) . Ash ' ; nine that Mary and Joeare brother and s:ster and both are known to Q and tLAlso  , Mary and Tim are fellow-workers with Q and R . Then to Q's question in 10) , R may felicitously respond with any or the ( 10 ) Q : Does Mary like skiing ? a . R : She love sie e-gkating . 
b.R :, Joeloves cross-country.
e . R : Tim like scros ~ country.
answers given-as well a ~ sa variety of others , such as ' Siten~ed to ' or even ' Joe used to love ice-skating  . ' That is , R may base his response upon anyone or more scalar sheperceives as invoked by Q's query  . In addition , a single lexical it ( : m ( here Mary may invoke more than one scale : R may view Mary as a member of a family or of a set of fellow-workers  , for example , to generate responses (10b ) and ( llc ) , respectively . 
C . A Scalar Representation of YNQs.
Given this characterization of appropriate indirect responses  , it is possible to model the exchanges present , ,d above in the following way : 1 . For some query uttered by Q , let PV " P represent the query's desideratum ; 2 . Let P xl/bl , x2/b2, . . . ,Xn/bnV-Pxl/b~,xg/b2, . . . ,Xn/bn represent the open propozition formed by substituting variables xI for each biir ~ vok cd by P that R perceives as lying on some scMeSi  ;  3 . Then PV'P?J ~ X,~z/xa, . . . , ~ n/X n ~/%, %/ ~ . , ,  .   .   .  ,  . ~ Jx , , defines the set ~ . , f possible responses to Q's query , where each a Irepre . - . ent some scalar coo*currier with its corresponding bion Si  . 
4 . A subset of these p ~, s sit . qere ~ ponses , the set of possible true respcmses , will be det ~ . rmined by 1? from his knowledge ba0: c , and an actual r~'sponsc~l~lectcd . 7In 16), for example , the de . - . ider : dumPV " q > ) of Q's query is the generic' ( all ) mush rooms are poisonous'V ' not ( all ) mush rooms are poisonous ' , tiersR might perceive a single scalar alllying on a quantifier scale  ,   , onc / / ~ ? ome/all . So , ' xI mush rooms are poisonous'V ' not xI\[ all  , broom sace poisonous ' represents the ( , pen proF-sition formed b ) substituting a variable for all in P , where x ! ranges over the values on SI . nor ~, / oorn,~/u ! l . Then the set of p . .- . ible resp ( . n ~: . ~ t t , t ~' s query , given P~'s choice of seal : ~ r , is dt , fin~ . d by the affirmatim lor ~ wgati~m of cach of the possible instantiations of ' al/xI mush rooms at  , ~ poisonous ' , or the set nonlush rool/is are poiso IIOUS .

50 mush r-on~s : ~ r ~ poisonous , ~ ailr : , ,a , hro , ~ms are poisonous . The set of po , . -ibh , truer, . sponscs will be a subset of this set , determined b ) ' It from Ir is know h : dgcba . s e . Note that a I and bl may in fact be identical . Thus , the simple direct responses , equivalent to ' All mush rooms are poisonous ' and ' Not all mush rooms are poi  . ~t ) nous ', are accorumodated in this schema . 
Thi ~ charact ~, riz : ttion of pot cnt . i al response . -, suggests a new repre~entath ) n for YNt~s . l ' oih ) wing Hintikka , one might paraphrase the query in ( 6 ) as ' Bring it about that I know that x tmushro ~ Jnlsare poisonous r ~ r that I know that  . not xtmushroomsart . ' poisonoust , where xI range ~ over the values on some scale S tup  . n which the qlo'riedv : due . ~ om ( appears ( assuming a many-sorte depi ~ temic logic )  . Thus the query alight be represented as !3~l . ~ XI(so :; , e , xtENtAKQ ( Nmush rooms are pois , ,nou ~) V KQ~(X t mi , shrooms are poisonous ) . 
For a query like that in(It )) , an appropriate representation might be : ! :3Sl-~Xt3S2  . :\] x2~\]Sa3x . ~ Mary , xtESiAIove , x2ES2 Askiing . xaES3AKQX1 x2 x3) VKQ~(Xlx2 x3) . 
lI may then instantiate each variable with any value from its domain in his response  . 
In the gem'rale ~ e , then , YNQs might be represented as 3SI ,  . . . ,:JSa3xI, . . . , 3x ~, bI , x1ES1A . . . . A bn,XnCS a A  KQ(l'x I . . . . . . n ) V Kq'Pxt . . . . . . n ) " This representation shares some features of standard representations of wh-qm  . stions, . ~ uggesting that it simply extends Kiefer's view of foct : s~ed"fNQs to all YNQs  . However , there are several : dgnificant di~tincthms between this representation and standard repres  ,  . ntatio as of wh-quest k ) ns , and , thus , between it and Kiefer's suggest hm . First , it restricts the domains of variables to scales invoked by corresponding scalars in the original queries desideratum and it includes a negative disjuu et  . ' Do you like I lonolulu ?' for example might have as its desideratum : : IS-:Ix  t:~S2::lx2"\]Ss3xa you , xlESIA like , x = ES2 Allonolulu , x . ~ESsAKQ(Xtx ~ xsJVK q~(Xix2xs) , while the corresponding wh-question ' What do you like ?' would have as its desideratum  32 lfQfVoulikez )  . Second , the representation prop , sed here allows for reference in a query to muhiple scalars  , or , multiple focii , which Kiefer does not consider . 
Third , it awJids both the division of YNQs into focussed and non-focussed queries and the dependency between wh-responses and negative responses noted above  ; hence , the representation is simpler and more unified . So , YNQs are not represented as wh-questions , although Kiefer's focussed YNQs can be accommodated in this more general representation  , which 1 will term a ~ eel ~ , " repreae ~ tatlo ~ . 
IVDISCUSSION
A scalar representation fYNQ scan accommodate a wide range of direct and indirect responses which are common in natural discourse but which current representations of YNQs cannot support  . Of course , such are definition is no panace a for the limitations of current representations : In its current form  , for instance , there are sonic appropriate responses to indirect speech acts  , such as ( ill , which it (11) Q : Can you tell me the time ?
R : It's 5:30.
will not support . In other exchanges , such as 12) , the notion of seale may seem less tha , ~ natural , where a scale like attribute * of a ( 12 ) Q : Isshepretty ?
R : She's married.
pot cn Haldate . : pr~:ttg , unmarried, . . . must be postulated to accommodate this query in the the representation proposed here  . 
Too , t be actual representation of a particular query may vary according to participants ' differing perception of scalars invoked by it  , as shown in ( I0) . Because scales are not defined in absolute terms , it is difficult to determin even an abstract specification of the set of all possible responses to a given query  ; should temporal and modal variables always be understood as implicitly evoked by any query  , for example , as in 13) ? However , if broad categories of sucb ( 13 ) Q : IsGloria ablon de?a . R : She used to be . 
b . R : She could be.
' understood'scales can be identified , much of this difficulty might . 
be alleviated . The representation proposed here does accommodate a far larger class of appropriate responses than representations previously suggested  , and accommodates them in a unified way . With further refinement it promises to provide a useful tool for theoretical and computational treatments of YNQs  .
