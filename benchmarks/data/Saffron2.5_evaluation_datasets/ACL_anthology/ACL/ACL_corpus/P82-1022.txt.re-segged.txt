Although 1972 was the year that Winograd published his now classic natural language Study of the blocks world  , that fact had not yet penetrated to the ACL . At that time people with AI computational interests were strictly in a minority in the association and it was a radical move to appoint Roger Schank as program chairman for the year's meeting  . That was also the year that we didn't have a presidential banquet  , and my"speech " was a few informal remarks at the road house restaurant somewhere in North Carolin are assuring a doubtful few members that computational understanding of natural language was certainly progressing and that applied natural language systems were distinctly feasible  . 
Myown perceptions of the state of computational linguistics during that period were given in " On Seeing the Elephant " in the Finite String  , March-Aprll 1972 . Is a wit as a time of confusion , of competition among structuralists , transformationallsts , and the new breed of computer nlks . " On Seeing the Elephant " was are statement of the old Su fiparable that suggested that we each perceived only isolated parts of our science  . 
That was the period during which Jonathan Slocum and I were concerned with using Augmented Transition Networks to generate coherent English from semantic networks  . That llne of research was originated by the first President of the Association  , Victor Yngve , who in 1960 had published descriptions of algorithms for using a phrase structure grammar to generate syntactically wellformed nonsense sentences \ [ Yngve  1960\]  . 
Sheld on Klein and I about 1962-1964 were fascinated by the technique and generalized it to a method for controlling the sense of what was generated by respecting the semantic dependencies of words as they occurred in text  . Yngve's work was truly seminal and it continued to inspire Sheld on for years as he developed method after method for generating detective stories and now operas  . I , too , with various students continued to explore the generation side of language  , most recently with Correlra \[1979\] , using a form of story tree to construct stories and their summaries  . No matter that Meehan found better methods and Bill Mann and his colleagues continue to improve on the techniques  . The use of a phrase structure grammar to control the sequence in which sentences and words are p ~oduced remains quite as fascinating as its use in translatl n ~ sentences to representations of meaning  . 
It is possible to communicate the technique for controlled generation of text in Just a few paragraphs  , so in dedication to Yngve , Klein , and i00 the many others of the discipline who share our fascination with generation of meaningful language  , the following description is presented . 
The last two lines of Keats " " Ode to a
Grecian Urn " are:
Beauty is truth , truth beauty , that is all Yek no wo nearth and ally eneed to know  . 
To form semantically controlled variations on this verse we can create substitution classes as below :\[ SCLASS\[SCLASS\[SCLASS\[SCLASS\[ SCLASS\[SCLASS\[SCLASS BEAUTY life knowledge wisdom love this \] 
TRUT Hhonor Joyrap ture love all \] ( THATISALL ) (that's all ) (that's what )   ( it's all ) (it's what ) \]
YE you we I some they \]
KNOW sense have get seemeet \] ( ONEARTH )   ( for living ) (til heaven )   ( tilhell ) (in llfe ) \]  ( NEED TO )   ( have to ) (ought to ) (want to ) \] and llne rules similar to phrase structure forms  . 
( I think of the couplet as a threellneverse . ) \[ KLINEI beauty is truth -- truth beauty \] \[ KLINE2   ( that is all ) ye know ( on earth ) \]\[ KLINE 3 ( that is all ) ye ( need to ) know \]
Each KLINE i rewrites as a conjunction terms , e . g . , KLINEI --> beauty + is + truth . . . + beauty . 

The line rules are composed of terms such as " beauty "  , " that is all " , etc . , that begin SCLASS predications , and of terminals such as " is " and "--" that do not  . Poem and verse can also be defined as rules :\[ POEM title verse verse  . . . verse\]\[TITLE ( Variation on Keats " Truthis Beauty ) \]\[ VERSE kline l kllne2   kllne3\] Actually it is more convenient to define these latter three elements as program to control choice of grammar  , spacing , and number of verses . In either case , a POEM is a TITLE followed by VERSEs , an ~ ~ VERSE is three lines each composed of terminals that occur in a KLINE or of selections from the matching substitution class  . 
Only one other program element is required : a random selection function to pseud or and omly choose an element from a substitution class and to record that element as chosen :  ( ( CHOOSE ( FIRST . REMDR ) CHOICE )  <  ( CHOSENFIRS ~ CHOICE ) )  ( ( CHOOSE ( FYRST . REMDR)CHOICE ) <( RANDOM*(FIRST . REMI~R ) CHOICE ) ( ASSERT(CHOSENjHOICE )) ~
Note : CHOOSE is called with the content of an SCLASS rule in the list  ( FIRST . REMDR ) ; if a choice for the term has previously been made in the verse  , CHOICE is taken from the predicate , ( CHOSENFIRSTCHOICE ) . If not , RANDOM * selects an element and records it as CHOSEN  . When a verse is begun , any existing CHOSEN predicates are deleted . 
This is a procedural logic program with lists in dot notation and variables marked using the underscore  . It is presented to give a sense of how the program appears in Dan Chester's LISP version of PROLOG  . The rest of the program follows the poem , verse , and Keats-LINE rules given above . 
The program is called by ( POGENKEATS4) , KEATS selecting the grammar and 4 signifying the number of verses . A couple of recordings of its behavior appear below  . 
* ( POGENKEATS 4 )   ( VARIATIONSONKEATS " TRUTHISBEAUTY )   ( LOVE ISLOVE--LOVE LOVE )   ( ITSALLYEH AVETILHEAVEN )   ( ITSALLYENEED TO HAVE )   ( LOVE ISLOVE--LOVE LOVE )   ( THATS ALL THEY KNOWONE ARTH )   ( THATS ALL THEYOUGHT TOKNOW )   ( WISDOMISRAPTURE--RAPTUREWISDOM )   ( ITSWHATY OUME ETFORLIVING )   ( ITSWHATYOU WANT TOMEET )   ( LOVE IS ALL--ALLLOVE )   ( THATS ALLWESENSETILHELL )   ( THATS ALL WEH AVE TOSENSE )   ( ( POGEN KEATS 4 ) ) * ( POGENKEATS 5 )   ( VARIATIONSONKEATS " TRUTHISBEAUTY )   ( BEAUTYISTRUTH--TRUTHBEAUTY )   ( THATSWHATYESEEONEARTH )   ( THATS WHATYE WANT TOSEE )   ( KNOWLEDGEIS ALL -- ALLKNOWLEDGE )   ( ITSALL THEY MEET TILHELL )   ( ITSALL THEY HAVE TOMEET )  ***  ( LOVEISRAPTURE--RAPTURELOVE )   ( ITSALL SOMEK NOW TILHE AVEN )   ( ITSALL SOMENEED TOKNOW )   ( LIFEISRAPTURE--RAPTURELIFE )   ( THATS WHATS OMEG ETFORLIVING )   ( THATS WHATS OMEOUGH TTOGET )  ***  ( LIFEISLOVE--LOVELIFE )   ( ITSALLISENSE ONEARTH )   ( ITSALLIWANTTOSENSE )  ***  ( ( POGEN KEATS 5 ) )
Perhaps the severses might best be characterized as those Keatswisely rejected  . 
Neverthelessour robot-poet demonstrates the effectiveness of phrase structure organization and substitution classes for selecting and ordering actions  . 
The ideas of Pogenled to related methods for creating paraphrases  , answering questions , and translating between languages . The principle of phrase structure organization has permeated our NL efforts and found a particularly friendly environment in procedural logic where Chester and I  \[1982\] show that the same grammar that translates English strings into semantic representations can serve to translate the representations into English strings  . This result , confirming an earlier finding by Heldorn , greatly simplifies the linguistic programming requirements for NL translation and text questioning systems  . 
Since 1972 the computational linguistics world has changed much  . Today AI and Logic interests tend to overshadow linguistic approaches to language  . But despite all the complexities in translating between NL constituents and computational representations  , augmented phrase structure grammars provide a general and effective means to guide the flow of computation  .
