Abstract
Among syntaxbased translation models , the tree-based approach , which takes as input a parse tree of the source sentence , is a promising direction being faster and simpler than its string-based counterpart . However , current tree-based systems suffer from a major drawback : they only use the 1best parse to direct the translation , which potentially introduces translation mistakes due to parsing errors . We propose a forest-based approach that translates a packed forest of exponentially many parses , which encodes many more alternatives than standard nbest lists . Large-scale experiments show an absolute improvement of 1.7 BLEU points over the 1best baseline . This result is also 0.8 points higher than decoding with 30-best parses , and takes even less time.
1 Introduction
Syntax-based machine translation has witnessed promising improvements in recent years . Depending on the type of input , these efforts can be divided into two broad categories : the string-based systems whose input is a string to be simultaneously parsed and translated by a synchronous grammar ( Wu , 1997; Chiang , 2005; Galley et al , 2006), and the tree-based systems whose input is already a parse tree to be directly converted into a target tree or string ( Lin , 2004; Ding and Palmer , 2005; Quirk et al , 2005; Liu et al , 2006; Huang et al , 2006).
Compared with their string-based counterparts , tree-based systems offer some attractive features : they are much faster in decoding ( linear time vs . cubic time , see ( Huang et al , 2006)), do not require a binary-branching grammar as in string-based models ( Zhang et al , 2006), and can have separate grammars for parsing and translation , say , a contextfree grammar for the former and a tree substitution grammar for the latter ( Huang et al , 2006). However , despite these advantages , current tree-based systems suffer from a major drawback : they only use the 1best parse tree to direct the translation , which potentially introduces translation mistakes due to parsing errors ( Quirk and Corston-Oliver , 2006). This situation becomes worse with resource-poor source languages without enough Treebank data to train a high-accuracy parser.
One obvious solution to this problem is to take as input kbest parses , instead of a single tree . This kbest list postpones some disambiguation to the decoder , which may recover from parsing errors by getting a better translation from a non 1best parse.
However , a kbest list , with its limited scope , often has too few variations and too many redundancies ; for example , a 50-best list typically encodes a combination of 5 or 6 binary ambiguities ( since 25 < 50 < 26), and many subtrees are repeated across different parses ( Huang , 2008). It is thus inefficient either to decode separately with each of these very similar trees . Longer sentences will also aggravate this situation as the number of parses grows exponentially with the sentence length.
We instead propose a new approach , forest-based translation ( Section 3), where the decoder translates a packed forest of exponentially many parses,1 1There has been some confusion in the MT literature regarding the term forest : the word ? forest ? in ? forest-to-string rules ?

which compactly encodes many more alternatives than kbest parses . This scheme can be seen as a compromise between the string-based and tree-based methods , while combining the advantages of both : decoding is still fast , yet does not commit to a single parse . Large-scale experiments ( Section 4) show an improvement of 1.7 BLEU points over the 1best baseline , which is also 0.8 points higher than decoding with 30-best trees , and takes even less time thanks to the sharing of common subtrees.
2 Tree-based systems
Current tree-based systems perform translation in two separate steps : parsing and decoding . A parser first parses the source language input into a 1best tree T , and the decoder then searches for the best derivation ( a sequence of translation steps ) d ? that converts source tree T into a target-language string among all possible derivations D : d ? = argmax d?D
P(d|T ). (1)
We will now proceed with a running example translating from Chinese to English : (2) ?

which results in two unfinished subtrees in ( c ). Then rule r2 grabs the Bu`sh ?? subtree and transliterate it ( r2) NPB(NR(Bu`sh ??))? Bush.
Similarly , rule r3 shown in Figure 1 is applied to the VP subtree , which swaps the two NPBs , yielding the situation in ( d ). This rule is particularly interesting since it has multiple levels on the source side , which has more expressive power than synchronous contextfree grammars where rules are flat.

More formally , a ( tree-to-string ) translation rule ( Huang et al , 2006) is a tuple ? t , s , ??, where t is the source-side tree , whose internal nodes are labeled by nonterminal symbols in N , and whose frontier nodes are labeled by source-side terminals in ? or variables from a set X = { x1, x2, . . .}; s ? ( X ??)? is the target-side string where ? is the target language terminal set ; and ? is a mapping from X to nonterminals in N . Each variable xi ? X occurs exactly once in t and exactly once in s . We denote R to be the translation rule set . A similar formalism appears in another form in ( Liu et al , 2006). These rules are in the reverse direction of the original string-to-tree transducer rules defined by Galley et al (2004).
Finally , from step ( d ) we apply rules r4 and r5 ( r4) NPB(NN(hu?`ta?n ))? a talk ( r5) NPB(NR(Sha?lo?ng ))? Sharon which perform phrasal translations for the two remaining subtrees , respectively , and get the Chinese translation in ( e).
3 Forestbased translation
We now extend the tree-based idea from the previous section to the case of forest-based translation.
Again , there are two steps , parsing and decoding.
In the former , a ( modified ) parser will parse the input sentence and output a packed forest ( Section 3.1) rather than just the 1best tree . Such a forest is usually huge in size , so we use the forest pruning algorithm ( Section 3.4) to reduce it to a reasonable size.
The pruned parse forest will then be used to direct the translation.
In the decoding step , we first convert the parse forest into a translation forest using the translation rule set , by similar techniques of pattern-matching from tree-based decoding ( Section 3.2). Then the decoder searches for the best derivation on the translation forest and outputs the target string ( Section 3.3).
3.1 Parse Forest
Informally , a packed parse forest , or forest in short , is a compact representation of all the derivations ( i.e ., parse trees ) for a given sentence under a contextfree grammar ( Billot and Lang , 1989). For example , consider the Chinese sentence in Example (2) above , which has ( at least ) two readings depending on the part-of-speech of the word yu ?, which can be either a preposition ( P ? with ?) or a conjunction ( CC ? and ?). The parse tree for the preposition case is shown in Figure 2(b ) as the 1best parse , while for the conjunction case , the two proper nouns ( Bu`sh ?? and Sha?lo?ng ) are combined to form a coordinated NP
NPB0,1 CC1,2 NPB2,3
NP0,3 (*) which functions as the subject of the sentence . In this case the Chinese sentence is translated into (3) ? [ Bush and Sharon ] held a talk?.
Shown in Figure 3(a ), these two parse trees can be represented as a single forest by sharing common subtrees such as NPB0,1 and VPB3,6. Such a forest has a structure of a hypergraph ( Klein and Manning , 2001; Huang and Chiang , 2005), where items like NP0,3 are called nodes , and deductive steps like (*) correspond to hyperedges.
More formally , a forest is a pair ? V,E ?, where V is the set of nodes , and E the set of hyperedges . For a given sentence w1:l = w1 . . . wl , each node v ? V is in the form of X i,j , which denotes the recognition of nonterminal X spanning the substring from positions i through j ( that is , wi+1 . . . wj ). Each hyperedge e ? E is a pair ? tails(e ), head(e )?, where head(e ) ? V is the consequent node in the deductive step , and tails(e ) ? V ? is the list of antecedent nodes . For example , the hyperedge for deduction (*) is notated : ?( NPB0,1, CC1,2, NPB2,3), NP0,3?.
There is also a distinguished root node TOP in each forest , denoting the goal item in parsing , which is simply S0,l where S is the start symbol and l is the sentence length.
3.2 Translation Forest
Given a parse forest and a translation rule setR , we can generate a translation forest which has a similar hypergraph structure . Basically , just as the depth-first traversal procedure in tree-based decoding ( Figure 2), we visit in topdown order each node v in the

parse forest , and try to pattern-match each translation rule r against the local subforest under node v.
For example , in Figure 3(a ), at node VP1,6, two rules r3 and r7 both matches the local subforest , and will thus generate two translation hyperedges e3 and e4 ( see Figure 3(b-c)).
More formally , we define a function match(r , v ) which attempts to pattern-match rule r at node v in the parse forest , and in case of success , returns a list of descendent nodes of v that are matched to the variables in r , or returns an empty list if the match fails . Note that this procedure is recursive and may 1: Input : parse forest Hp and rule setR 2: Output : translation forest Ht 3: for each node v ? Vp in topdown order do 4: for each translation rule r ? R do 5: vars ? match(r , v ) ? variables 6: if vars is not empty then 7: e ? ? vars , v , s(r )? 8: add translation hyperedge e to Ht involve multiple parse hyperedges . For example , match(r3,VP1,6) = ( NPB2,3, NPB5,6), which covers three parse hyperedges , while nodes in gray do not pattern-match any rule ( although they are involved in the matching of other nodes , where they match interior nodes of the source-side tree fragments in a rule ). We can thus construct a translation hyperedge from match(r , v ) to v for each node v and rule r . In addition , we also need to keep track of the target string s(r ) specified by rule r , which includes target-language terminals and variables . For example , s(r3) = ? held x2 with x1?. The subtranslations of the matched variable nodes will be substituted for the variables in s(r ) to get a complete translation for node v . So a translation hyperedge e is a triple ? tails(e ), head(e ), s ? where s is the target string from the rule , for example , e3 = ?( NPB2,3, NPB5,6),VP1,6, ? held x2 with x1??.
This procedure is summarized in Pseudocode 1.
3.3 Decoding Algorithms
The decoder performs two tasks on the translation forest : 1best search with integrated language model ( LM ), and kbest search with LM to be used in minimum error rate training . Both tasks can be done efficiently by forest-based algorithms based on kbest parsing ( Huang and Chiang , 2005).
For 1best search , we use the cube pruning technique ( Chiang , 2007; Huang and Chiang , 2007) which approximately intersects the translation forest with the LM . Basically , cube pruning works bottom up in a forest , keeping at most k + LM items at each node , and uses the bestfirst expansion idea from the Algorithm 2 of Huang and Chiang (2005) to speed up the computation . An + LM item of node v has the form ( va?b ), where a and b are the target-language boundary words . For example , ( VP held ? Sharon1,6 ) is an + LM item with its translation starting with ? held ? and ending with ? Sharon ?. This scheme can be easily extended to work with a general ngram by storing n ? 1 words at both ends ( Chiang , 2007).
For kbest search after getting 1best derivation , we use the lazy Algorithm 3 of Huang and Chiang (2005) that works backwards from the root node , incrementally computing the second , third , through the kth best alternatives . However , this time we work on a finer-grained forest , called translation+LM forest , resulting from the intersection of the translation forest and the LM , with its nodes being the + LM items during cube pruning . Although this new forest is prohibitively large , Algorithm 3 is very efficient with minimal overhead on top of 1best.
3.4 Forest Pruning Algorithm
We use the pruning algorithm of ( Jonathan Graehl , p.c .; Huang , 2008) that is very similar to the method based on marginal probability ( Charniak and Johnson , 2005), except that it prunes hyperedges as well as nodes . Basically , we use an Inside-Outside algorithm to compute the Viterbi inside cost ?( v ) and the Viterbi outside cost ?( v ) for each node v , and then compute the merit ??( e ) for each hyperedge : ??( e ) = ?( head(e )) + ? ui?tails(e ) ?( ui ) (4) Intuitively , this merit is the cost of the best derivation that traverses e , and the difference ?( e ) = ??( e ) ? ?( TOP ) can be seen as the distance away from the globally best derivation . We prune away a hyperedge e if ?( e ) > p for a threshold p . Nodes with all incoming hyperedges pruned are also pruned.
4 Experiments
We can extend the simple model in Equation 1 to a loglinear one ( Liu et al , 2006; Huang et al , 2006): d ? = argmax d?D P(d | T )?0 ? e?1|d | ? Plm(s)?2 ? e?3|s | (5) where T is the 1best parse , e?1|d | is the penalty term on the number of rules in a derivation , Plm(s ) is the language model and e?3|s | is the length penalty term ditioned on 1best tree , P(d | T ), should now be replaced by P(d | Hp ) where Hp is the parse forest , which decomposes into the product of probabilities of translation rules r ? d:
P(d | Hp ) = ? r?d
P(r ) (6) where each P(r ) is the product of five probabilities:
P(r ) = P(t | s)?4 ? Plex(t | s)?5 ?
P(s | t)?6 ? Plex(s | t)?7 ? P(t | Hp ) ?8 .
(7)
Here t and s are the source-side tree and target-side string of rule r , respectively , P(t | s ) and P(s | t ) are the two translation probabilities , and Plex (?) are the lexical probabilities . The only extra term in forest-based decoding is P(t | Hp ) denoting the source side parsing probability of the current translation rule r in the parse forest , which is the product of probabilities of each parse hyperedge ep covered in the pattern-match of t against Hp ( which can be recorded at conversion time):
P(t | Hp ) = ? ep?Hp , ep covered by t
P(ep ). (8) 4.1 Data preparation
Our experiments are on Chinese-to-English translation , and we use the Chinese parser of Xiong et al (2005) to parse the source side of the bitext . Following Huang (2008), we modify the parser to output a packed forest for each sentence.
Our training corpus consists of 31,011 sentence pairs with 0.8M Chinese words and 0.9M English words . We first word-align them by GIZA ++ refined by ? diagand ? from Koehn et al (2003), and apply the tree-to-string rule extraction algorithm ( Galley et al ., 2006; Liu et al , 2006), which resulted in 346K translation rules . Note that our rule extraction is still done on 1best parses , while decoding is on kbest parses or packed forests . We also use the SRI Language Modeling Toolkit ( Stolcke , 2002) to train a trigram language model with Kneser-Ney smoothing on the English side of the bitext.
We use the 2002 NIST MT Evaluation test set as our development set (878 sentences ) and the 2005 0.230 0.232 0.234 0.236 0.238 0.240 0.242 0.244 0.246 0.248 0.250 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35

NIST MT Evaluation test set as our test set (1082 sentences ), with on average 28.28 and 26.31 words per sentence , respectively . We evaluate the translation quality using the case-sensitive BLEU4 metric ( Papineni et al , 2002). We use the standard minimum errorrate training ( Och , 2003) to tune the feature weights to maximize the system?s BLEU score on the dev set . On dev and test sets , we prune the Chinese parse forests by the forest pruning algorithm in Section 3.4 with a threshold of p = 12, and then convert them into translation forests using the algorithm in Section 3.2. To increase the coverage of the rule set , we also introduce a default translation hyperedge for each parse hyperedge by monotonically translating each tail node , so that we can always at least get a complete translation in the end.
4.2 Results
The BLEU score of the baseline 1best decoding is 0.2325, which is consistent with the result of 0.2302 in ( Liu et al , 2007) on the same training , development and test sets , and with the same rule extraction procedure . The corresponding BLEU score of Pharaoh ( Koehn , 2004) is 0.2182 on this dataset.
Figure 4 compares forest decoding with decoding on kbest trees in terms of speed and quality . Using more than one parse tree apparently improves the BLEU score , but at the cost of much slower decoding , since each of the top-k trees has to be decoded individually although they share many common subtrees . Forest decoding , by contrast , is much faster

and produces consistently better BLEU scores . With pruning threshold p = 12, it achieved a BLEU score of 0.2485, which is an absolute improvement of 1.6% points over the 1best baseline , and is statistically significant using the sign-test of Collins et al (2005) ( p < 0.01).
We also investigate the question of how often the ith-best parse tree is picked to direct the translation ( i = 1, 2, . . .), in both kbest and forest decoding schemes . A packed forest can be roughly viewed as a ( virtual)?-best list , and we can thus ask how often is a parse beyond top-k used by a forest , which relates to the fundamental limitation of kbest lists.
Figure 5 shows that , the 1best parse is still preferred 25% of the time among 30-best trees , and 23% of the time by the forest decoder . These ratios decrease dramatically as i increases , but the forest curve has a much longer tail in large i . Indeed , 40% of the trees preferred by a forest is beyond top-30, 32% is beyond top100, and even 20% beyond top-1000. This confirms the fact that we need exponentially large kbest lists with the explosion of alternatives , whereas a forest can encode these information compactly.
4.3 Scaling to large data
We also conduct experiments on a larger dataset , which contains 2.2M training sentence pairs . Besides the trigram language model trained on the English side of these bitext , we also use another trigram model trained on the first 1/3 of the Xinhua portion of Gigaword corpus . The two LMs have dis-approach \ ruleset TR TR+BP 1best tree 0.2666 0.2939 30-best trees 0.2755 0.3084 forest ( p = 12) 0.2839 0.3149 Table 1: BLEU score results from training on large data.
tinct weights tuned by minimum error rate training.
The dev and test sets remain the same as above.
Furthermore , we also make use of bilingual phrases to improve the coverage of the ruleset . Following Liu et al (2006), we prepare a phrasetable from a phrase-extractor , e.g . Pharaoh , and at decoding time , for each node , we construct on-the-fly flat translation rules from phrases that match the source-side span of the node . These phrases are called syntactic phrases which are consistent with syntactic constituents ( Chiang , 2005), and have been shown to be helpful in tree-based systems ( Galley et al , 2006;
Liu et al , 2006).
The final results are shown in Table 1, where TR denotes translation rule only , and TR+BP denotes the inclusion of bilingual phrases . The BLEU score of forest decoder with TR is 0.2839, which is a 1.7% points improvement over the 1best baseline , and this difference is statistically significant ( p < 0.01).
Using bilingual phrases further improves the BLEU score by 3.1% points , which is 2.1% points higher than the respective 1best baseline . We suspect this larger improvement is due to the alternative constituents in the forest , which activates many syntactic phrases suppressed by the 1best parse.
5 Conclusion and future work
We have presented a novel forest-based translation approach which uses a packed forest rather than the 1best parse tree ( or kbest parse trees ) to direct the translation . Forest provides a compact datastructure for efficient handling of exponentially many tree structures , and is shown to be a promising direction with state-of-the-art translation results and reasonable decoding speed . This work can thus be viewed as a compromise between string-based and tree-based paradigms , with a good tradeoff between speed and accuarcy . For future work , we would like to use packed forests not only in decoding , but also for translation rule extraction during training.
