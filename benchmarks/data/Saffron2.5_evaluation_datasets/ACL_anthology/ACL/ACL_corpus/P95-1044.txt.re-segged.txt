Abstract
We describe a computational framework
for a grammar architecture in which different linguistic domain such as morphology  , syntax , and semantics are treated not as separate components but compositional domains  . The framework is based on Combinatory Categorial Grammars and it uses the morpheme as the basic building block of the categorial lexicon  . 
1 Introduction
In this paper , we address the problem of modelling interactions between different levels of language analysis  . In agglutinative languages , affixes are attached to stems to form a word that may correspond to an entire phrase in a language like English  . For instance , in Turkish , word formation is based on suffixation of derivation alnd inflectional morphemes  . Phrases may be formed in a similar way (1) . 
(1 ) Yok sul-la~-t ~ r-zl-makta-larpo or-V-CAUS-PASS-ADV -PERS'  ( They ) are being made poor ( impoverished ) ' . 
In Turkish , there is a significant amount of interaction between morphology and syntax  . For instance , causative suffixes change the valence of the verb  , mad the reciprocal suffix subcategorize the verb for a noun phrase marked with the comitative case  . 
Moreover , the head that a bound morpheme modifies may be not its stem but a compound head crossing over the word boundaries  , e . g . ,  ( 2 ) i yioku-mu ~ ~ ocukwell read-REL child ' well -educated child ' In  ( 2 )  , the relative suffix-mu ~ ( in past form of subject participle ) modifies\[iyioku\]to give the scope\[\[\[ i y i o k u \] m u ~\]  9ocuk  \] . If syntactic omposi-tion is performed after morphological composition  , we would get compositions such as \[ i yi\[okumu  ~   6ocuk \]\] or\[\[iyiokurnu ~\] ~ ocuk\]which yield ill-formed semantics for this utterance  . 
As pointed out by Oehrle (1988) , there is no reason to assume a layered grammatic a lrchitecture which has linguistic division of labor into components acting on one domain at a time  . As a computational framework , rather than treating morphology , syntax and semantics in a cascaded manner , we propose an integrated model to capture the high level of interaction between the three domains  . The model , which is based on Combinatory Categorial Grammars  ( CCG )   ( Ades and Steedman , 1982; Steedman ,  1985) , uses the morpheme as the building block of composition at all three linguistic domains  . 
2 Morpheme-based Compositions
When the morpheme is given the same status as the lexeme in terms of its lexical  , syntactic , and semantic ontribution , the distinction between the process models of morphotactics and syntax disappears  . Consider the example in (3) . 
(3 ) uzunkol-lu g5mlek longs leeve-ADJ shirt Two different compositions 1 in CCG formalism are given in Figure 1  . Both interpretations are plausible , with ( la ) being the most likely in the absence of along pause after the first adjective  . To account for both cases , the suffix-lu must be allowed to modify the head it is attached to  ( e . g . , lb in Figure 1) , or a compound headen compassing the word boundaries  ( e . g . , 1: ~ in Figure 1) . 
3 Multi-domain Combination

Oehrle ( 1988 ) describes a model of multi-dimen-sional composition in which every domain Di has an algebra with a finite set of primitive operations  1Derived and basic categories in the examples are in fact feature structures  ; ee section 4 . 
We use ~' ~ to denote the combination of categories x and y giving the result z  .

'( lb ) ~ z~nkol-lug6mlekn/nlong(shirt(y , has ( sleeve ( z ) ) ) ) = ' a long shirt with sleeves ' Figure 1: Scope ambiguity of a nominal bound morpheme Fi . As indicated by Turkish data in sections 1 and 2 , Fimay in fact have a domain larger than -- but compatible with--Di  . 
In order to perform morphological nd syntactic compositions in a unified framework  , the slash operators of Categorial Grammar must be enriched with the knowledge about the type of process and the type of morpheme  . We adopt a representation similar to Hoek semand Janda's  ( 1988 ) notation for the operator . The 3-tuple < direction , morpheme type , process type > indicates direction 2(left , right , unspecified ) , morpheme type ( free , bound ) , and the type of morphological or syntactic attachment  ( e . g . , affix , clitic , syntactic concatenation , reduplication ) . Examples of different operator combinations are given in Figure  2  . 
4 Information Structure and
Tactical Constraints
Entries in the eategorial lexicon have tactical constraints  , grammatic alnd semantic features , and phonological representation . Similar to HPSG ( Pollard and Sag ,  1994) , every entry is a signed attribute-value matrix . Lexical and phrasal ele-2We have not yet incorporated into our model the word -order variation in syntax  . See ( Hoffman , 1992) for a CCG based approach to this phenomenon .

Fres\]/Lphon Jres-op-arg is the categorial notation for the element  . phon represent she phonological string . Lexical elements may have ( a ) phonemes , ( b ) mete-phonemes such as H for high vowel , and D for a dental whose voicing is not yet determined  , and ( c ) optional segments , e . g . , -( y)lA , to model vowel/consonant drops , in the phon feature . During composition , the surface forms of composed elements are mapped and saved in phon  . phonal so allows efficient lexicon search . For instance , the causative suffix-DH r has eight different realizations but only one lexical entry  . 
Every resandarg feature has an for p ( property ) sign:syn 1 pLSernj syn and sere are the sources of grammatical  ( gsign ) and semantic ( ssign ) properties , respectively . 
These properties include agreement feature such as person  , number , and possessive , and selectional re-"cattypeformrestr<cond > $" person " number possn prop case relative form " reflexive reciprocal causative passive v prop tense modal aspect person form restr<cond>gA special feature value called none is used for imposing certain morphotactic on straints  , and to make sure that the stem is not inflected with the same feature more than once  . It also ensures , through synconstraints , that inflections are marked in the right order ( cf . , Figure 3) . 
5 Conclusion
Turkish is a language in which grammatical functions can be marked morphologically  ( e . g . , case ), or syntactically ( e . g . , indirect objects ) . Semantic composition is also affected by the interplay of morphology and syntax  , for instance the change in the scope of modifiers and genitive suffixes  , or valency and thematic role change in causatives  . To model interactions between domains , we propose a categorial approach in which composition in all domains proceed in parallel  . As an implementation , we have been working on the modelling of Turkish causatives using this framework  .
