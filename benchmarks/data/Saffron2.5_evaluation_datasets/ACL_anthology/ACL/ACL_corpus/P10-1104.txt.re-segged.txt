Abstract
English noun/verb ( N/V ) pairs ( contract , cement ) have undergone complex patterns of change between 3 stress patterns for several centuries . We describe a longitudinal dataset of N/V pair pronunciations , leading to a set of properties to be accounted for by any computational model.
We analyze the dynamics of 5 dynamical systems models of linguistic populations , each derived from a model of learning by individuals . We compare each model?s dynamics to a set of properties observed in the N/V data , and reason about how assumptions about individual learning affect population-level dynamics.
1 Introduction
The fascinating phenomena of language evolution and language change have inspired much work from computational perspectives in recent years.
Research in this field considers populations of linguistic agents , and asks how the population dynamics are related to the behavior of individual agents . However , most such work makes little contact with empirical data ( de Boer and Zuidema , 2009).1 As pointed out by Choudhury (2007), most computational work on language change deals with data from cases of change either not at all , or at a relatively high level.2 Recent computational work has addressed ? real world ? data from change in several languages ( Mitchener , 2005; Choudhury et al , 2006; Choudhury et al , 2007; Pearl and Weinberg , 2007; Daland et al , 2007; Landsbergen , 2009). In the same 1However , among language evolution researchers there has been significant recent interest in behavioral experiments , using the ? iterated learning ? paradigm ( Griffiths and Kalish , 2007; Kalish et al , 2007; Kirby et al , 2008).
2We do not review the literature on computational studies of change due to space constraints ; see ( Baker , 2008; Wang et al , 2005; Niyogi , 2006) for reviews.
spirit , we use data from an ongoing stress shift in English noun/verb ( N/V ) pairs . Because stress has been listed in dictionaries for several centuries , we are able to trace stress longitudinally and at the level of individual words , and observe dynamics significantly more complicated than in changes previously considered in the computational literature . In ?2, we summarize aspects of the dynamics to be accounted for by any computational model of the stress shift . We also discuss proposed sources of these dynamics from the literature , based on experimental work by psychologists and linguists.
In ?3?4, we develop models in the mathematical framework of dynamical systems ( DS ), which over the past 15 years has been used to model the interaction between language learning and language change in a variety of settings ( Niyogi and Berwick , 1995; Niyogi and Berwick , 1996; Niyogi , 2006; Komarova et al , 2001; Yang , 2001; Yang , 2002; Mitchener , 2005; Pearl and Weinberg , 2007).
We interpret 6 aspects of the N/V stress dynamics in DS terms ; this gives a set of 6 desired properties to which any DS model?s dynamics can be compared . We consider 5 models of language learning by individuals , based on the experimental findings relevant to the N/V stress shift , and evaluate the population-level dynamics of the dynamical system model resulting from each against the set of desired properties . We are thus able to reason about which theories of the source of language change ? considered as hypotheses about how individuals learn ? lead to the population-level patterns observed in change.
2 Data : English N/V pairs
The data considered here are the stress patterns of English homographic , disyllabic noun/verb pairs ( Table 1); we refer to these throughout as ? N/V pairs ?. Each of the N and V forms of a pair can have initial (???: co?nvict , n .) or final (???: conv??ct , {1, 1} ??? ??? ( exile , anchor , fracture ) {1, 2} ??? ??? ( consort , protest , refuse ) {2, 2} ??? ??? ( cement , police , review ) Table 1: Attested N/V pair stress patterns.
v .) stress . We use the notation { Nstress,Vstress } to denote the stress of an N/V pair , with 1=???, 2=???. Of the four logically possible stress patterns , all current N/V pairs follow one of the 3 patterns shown in Table 1: {1,1}, {1,2}, {2,2}.3 No pair follows the fourth possible pattern , {2,1}.
N/V pairs have been undergoing variation and change between these 3 patterns since Middle English ( ME , c . 1066-1470), especially change to {1,2}. The vast majority of stress shifts occurred after 1570 ( Minkova , 1997), when the first dictionary listing English word stresses was published ( Levens , 1570). Many dictionaries from the 17th century on list word stresses , making it possible to trace change in the stress of individual N/V pairs in considerable detail.
2.1 Dynamics
Expanding on dictionary pronunciation data collected by Sherman (1975) for the period 1570? 1800, we have collected a corpus of pronunciations of 149 N/V pairs , as listed in 62 British dictionaries , published 1570?2007. Variation and change in N/V pair stress can be visualized by plotting stress trajectories : the moving average of N and V stress vs . time for a given pair . Some examples are shown in Fig . 1. The corpus is described in detail in ( Sonderegger and Niyogi , 2010); here we summarize the relevant facts to be accounted for in a computational model.4 Change Four types of clearcut change between the three stress patterns are observed : {2,2}?{1,2} ( Fig.1(a )) {1,2}?{1,1} {1,1}?{1,2} ( Fig . 1(b )) {1,2}?{2,2} However , change to {1,2} is much more common than change from {1,2}; in particular , {2,2}?{1,2} is the most common change . When 3However , as variation and change in N/V pair stress is ongoing , a few pairs ( e.g . perfume ) currently have variable stress . By ? stress ?, we always mean ? primary stress?.
All present-day pronunciations are for British English , from
CELEX ( Baayen et al , 1996).
4The corpus is available on the first author?s home page ( currently , people.cs.uchicago.edu/?morgan).
change occurs , it is often fairly sudden , as in Figs . 1(a ), 1(b ). Finally , change never occurs directly between {1,1} and {2,2}.
Stability Previous work on stress in N/V pairs ( Sherman , 1975; Phillips , 1984) has emphasized change , in particular {2,2}?{1,2} ( the most common change ). However , an important aspect of the diachronic dynamics of N/V pairs is stability : most N/V pairs do not show variation or change.
The 149 N/V pairs , used both in our corpus and in previous work , were chosen by Sherman (1975) as those most likely to have undergone change , and thus are not suitable for studying how stable the three attested stress patterns are . In a random sample of N/V pairs ( not the set of 149) in use over a fixed time period (1700?2007), we find that only 12% have shown variation or change in stress ( Sonderegger and Niyogi , 2010). Most pairs maintain the {1,1}, {2,2}, or {1,2} stress pattern for hundreds of years . A model of the diachronic dynamics of N/V pair stress must explain how it can be the case both that some pairs show variation and change , and that many do not.
Variation N/V pair stress patterns show both synchronic and diachronic variation.
Synchronically , there is variation at the population level in the stress of some N/V pairs at any given time ; this is reflected by the inclusion of more than one pronunciation for some N/V pairs in many dictionaries . An important question for modeling is whether there is variation within individual speakers . We show in ( Sonderegger and Niyogi , 2010) that there is , for present-day American English speakers , using a corpus of radio speech . For several N/V pairs which have currently variable pronunciation , 1/3 of speakers show variation in the stress of the N form . Metrical evidence from poetry suggests that individual variation also existed in the past ; the best evidence is for Shakespeare , who shows variation in the stress of over 20 N/V pairs ( Ko?keritz , 1953).
Diachronically , a relevant question for modeling is whether all variation is shortlived , or whether stable variation is possible . A particular type of stable variation is in fact observed relatively often in the corpus : either the N or V form stably vary ( Fig . 1(c )), but not both at once . Stable variation where both N and V forms vary almost never occurs ( Fig . 1(d)).

esizes that N/V pairs with lower frequencies ( summed N+V word frequencies ) are more likely to change to {1,2}. Sonderegger (2010) shows that this is the case for the most common change , {2,2}?{1,2}: among N/V pairs which were {2,2} in 1700 and are either {2,2} or {1,2} today , those which have undergone change have significantly lower frequencies , on average , than those which have not . In ( Sonderegger and Niyogi , 2010), we give preliminary evidence from realtime frequency trajectories ( for <10 N/V pairs ) that it is not lower frequency per se which triggers change to {1,2}, but falling frequency . For example , change in combat from {1,1}?{1,2} around 1800 ( Fig . 1(b )) coincides with falling word frequency from 1775?present.
2.2 Sources of change
The most salient facts about English N/V pair stress are that ( a ) change is most often to {1,2} ( b ) the {2,1} pattern never occurs . We summarize two types of explanation for these facts from the experimental literature , each of which exemplifies a commonly-proposed type of explanation for phonological change . In both cases , there is experimental evidence for biases in present-day English speakers reflecting ( a?b ). We assume that these biases have been active over the course of the N/V stress shift , and can thus be seen as possible sources of the diachronic dynamics of N/V pairs.5 5This type of assumption is necessary for any hypothesis about the sources of a completed or ongoing change , based on present-day experimental evidence , and is thus common in the literature . In the case of N/V pairs , it is implicitly made in Kelly?s (1988 et seq ) account , discussed below . Both biases discussed here stem from facts about English ( Ross ? Generalization ; rhythmic context ) that we believe have not changed over the time period considered here (?1600?present ), based on general accounts of English historical phonology during this period ( Lass , 1992; MacMahon , 1998). We leave more careful verification of this claim to future work.
Analogy/Lexicon In historical linguistics , analogical changes are those which make ?... related forms more similar to each other in their phonetic ( and morphological ) structure ? ( Hock , 1991).6 Proposed causes for analogical change thus often involve a speaker?s production and perception of a form being influenced by similar forms in their lexicon.
The English lexicon shows a broad tendency , which we call Ross ? generalization , which could be argued to be driving analogical change to {1,2}, and acting against the unobserved stress pattern {2,1}: ? primary stress in English nouns is farther to the left than primary stress in English verbs ? ( Ross , 1973). Change to {1,2} could be seen as motivated by Ross ? generalization , and {2,1} made impossible by it.
The argument is lent plausibility by experimental evidence that Ross ? Generalization is reflected in production and perception . English listeners strongly prefer the typical stress pattern ( N =??? or V =???) in novel English disyllables ( Guion et al , 2003), and process atypical disyllables ( N =??? or V =???) more slowly than typical ones ( Arciuli and
Cupples , 2003).
Mistransmission An influential line of research holds that many phonological changes are based in asymmetric transmission errors : because of articulatory or perceptual factors , listeners systematically mishear some sound ? as ?, but rarely mishear ? as ?.7 We call such effects mistransmission . Asymmetric mistransmission ( by individu-6?Forms ? here means any linguistic unit ; e.g . sounds , words , or paradigms , such as an N/V pair?s stress pattern.
7A standard example is final obstruent devoicing , a common change crosslinguistically . There are several articulatory and perceptual reasons why final voiced obstruents could be heard as unvoiced , but no motivation for the reverse process ( final unvoiced obstruents heard as voiced ) ( Blevins , 2006).
1021 als ) is argued to be a necessary condition for the change ??? at the population level , and an explanation for why the change ??? is common , while the change ??? is rarely ( or never ) observed . Mistransmission-based explanations were pioneered by Ohala (1981, et seq .), and are the subject of much recent work ( reviewed by Hansson , 2008) For English N/V pairs , M . Kelly and collaborators have shown mistransmission effects which they propose are responsible for the directionality of the most common type of N/V pair stress shifts ({1,1}, {2,2}?{1,2}), based on ? rhythmic context ? ( Kelly , 1988; Kelly and Bock , 1988; Kelly , 1989). Word stress is misperceived more often as initial in ? trochaic-biasing ? contexts , where the preceding syllable is weak or the following syllable is heavy ; and more often as final in analogously ? iambic-biasing ? contexts . Nouns occur more frequently in trochaic contexts , and verbs more frequently in iambic contexts ; there is thus pressure for the V forms of {1,1} pairs to be misperceived as ???, and for the N forms of {2,2} pairs to be misperceived as ???.
3 Modeling preliminaries
We first describe assumptions and notation for models developed below (?4).
Because of the evidence for within-speaker variation in N/V pair stress (?2.1), in all models described below , we assume that what is learned for a given N/V pair are the probabilities of using the ??? form for the N and V forms.
We also make several simplifying assumptions.
There are discrete generations Gt , and learners in Gt learn from Gt?1. Each example a learner in Gt hears is equally likely to come from any member of Gt?1. Each learner receives an identical number of examples , and each generation has infinitely many members.
These are idealizations , adopted here to keep models simple enough to analyze ; the effects of relaxing some of these assumptions have been explored by Niyogi (2006) and Sonderegger (2009).
The infinite-population assumption in particular makes the dynamics fully deterministic ; this rules out the possibility of change due to drift ( or sample variation ), where a form disappears from the population because no examples of it are encountered by learners in Gt in the input from Gt?1.
Notation For a fixed N/V pair , a learner in Gt hears N1 examples of the N form , of which kt1 are ??? and ( N1-kt1) are ???; N2 and k t 2 are similarly defined for V examples . Each example is sampled i.i.d . from a random member of Gt?1. The Ni are fixed ( each learner hears the same number of examples ), while the kti are random variables ( over learners in Gt ). Each learner applies an algorithm A to the N1+N2 examples to learn ?? t , ?? t ? [0, 1], the probabilities of producing N and V examples as ???. ? t , ? t are the expectation of ?? t and ?? t over members of Gt : ? t = E(??t ), ? t = E(??t ). ?? t and ?? t are thus random variables ( over learners in Gt ), while ? t , ? t ? [0, 1] are numbers.
Because learners in Gt draw examples at random from members of Gt?1, the distributions of ?? t and ?? t are determined by (? t?1, ? t?1).
(?t , ? t ), the expectations of ?? t and ?? t , are thus determined by (? t?1, ? t?1) via an iterated map f : f : [0, 1]2 ? [0, 1]2, f(?t , ? t ) = (? t+1, ? t+1).
3.1 Dynamical systems
We develop and analyze models of populations of language learners in the mathematical framework of ( discrete ) dynamical systems ( DS ) ( Niyogi and Berwick , 1995; Niyogi , 2006). This setting allows us to determine the diachronic , population-level consequences of assumptions about the learning algorithm used by individuals , as well as assumptions about population structure or the input they receive.
Because it is in general impossible to solve a given iterated map as a function of t , the dynamical systems viewpoint is to understand its longterm behavior by finding its fixed points and bifurcations : changes in the number and stability of fixed points as system parameters vary.
Briefly , ?? is a fixed point ( FP ) of f if f (??) = ??; it is stable if lim t ?? ? t = ?? for ?0 sufficiently near ??, and unstable otherwise ; these are also called stable states and unstable states . Intuitively , ?? is stable iff the system is stable under small perturbations from ??.8 In the context of a linguistic population , change from state ? (100% of the population uses {1,1}) to state ? (100% of the population uses {1,2}) corresponds to a bifurcation , where some system parameter ( N ) passes a critical value ( N0). For 8See ( Strogatz , 1994; Hirsch et al , 2004) for introductions to dynamical systems in general , and ( Niyogi , 2006) for the type of models considered here.
1022
N<N0, ? is stable . For N>N0, ? is unstable , and ? is stable ; this triggers change from ? to ?.
3.2 DS interpretation of observed dynamics Below , we describe 5 DS models of linguistic populations . To interpret whether each model has properties consistent with the N/V dataset , we translate the observations about the dynamics of N/V stress made above (?2.1) into DS terms . This gives a list of desired properties against which to evaluate the properties of each model.
1. ?{2,1}: {2,1} is not a stable state.
2. Stability of {1,1}, {1,2}, {2,2}: These stress patterns correspond to stable states ( for some system parameter values).
3. Observed stable variation : Stable states are possible ( for some system parameter values ) corresponding to variation in the N or V form , but not both.
4. Sudden change : Change from one stress pattern to another corresponds to a bifurcation , where the fixed point corresponding to the old stress pattern becomes unstable.
5. Observed changes : There are bifurcations corresponding to each of the four observed changes ({1,1}?? {1,2}, {2,2}?? {1,2}).
6. Observed frequency dependence : Change to {1,2} corresponds to a bifurcation in frequency ( N ), where {2,2} or {1,1} loses stability as N is decreased.
4 Models
We now describe 5 DS models , each corresponding to a learning algorithm A used by individual language learners . Each A leads to an iterated map , f(?t , ? t ) = (? t+1, ? t+1), which describes the state of the population of learners over successive generations . We give these evolution equations for each model , then discuss their dynamics , i.e . bifurcation structure . Each model?s dynamics are evaluated with respect to the set of desired properties corresponding to patterns observed in the N/V data . Derivations have been mostly omitted for reasons of space , but are given in ( Sonderegger , 2009).
The models differ along two dimensions , corresponding to assumptions about the learning algorithm ( A ): whether or not it is assumed that the stress of examples is possibly mistransmitted ( Models 1, 3, 5), and how the N and V probabilities acquired by a given learner are coupled . In Model 1 there is no coupling (?? t and ?? t learned independently ), in Models 2?3 coupling takes the form of a hard constraint corresponding to Ross ? generalization , and in Models 4?5 different stress patterns have different prior probabilities.9 4.1 Model 1: Mistransmission Motivated by the evidence for asymmetric misperception of N/V pair stress (?2.2), suppose the stress of N =??? and V =??? examples may be misperceived ( as N =??? and V =???), with mistransmission probabilities p and q.
Learners are assumed to simply probability match : ?? t = kt1/N1, ?? t = k t 2/N2, where k t 1 is the number of N and V examples heard as ??? ( etc .) The probabilities pN,t & pV,t of hearing an N or V example as final stressed at t are then pN,t = ? t?1(1? p ), pV,t = ? t?1 + (1? ? t?1)q (1) kt1 and k t 2 are binomially-distributed:
PB(k t 1, k t 2) ? (
N1 kt1 ) pN,t kt1(1? pN,t)
N1?kt1 ? (
N2 kt2 ) pV,t kt2(1? pV,t)
N2?kt2 (2) ? t and ? t , the probability that a random member of Gt produces N and V examples as ???, are the ensemble averages of ?? t and ?? t over all members of Gt . Because we have assumed infinitely many learners per generation , ? t=E(??t ) and ? t=E(??t).
Using (1), and the formula for the expectation of a binomially-distributed random variable : ? t = ? t?1(1? p ) (3) ? t = ? t?1 + (1? ? t?1)q (4) these are the evolution equations for Model 1.
Due to space constraints we do not give the ( more lengthy ) derivations of the evolution equations in
Models 2?5.
Dynamics There is a single , stable fixed point of evolution equations (3?4): (??, ??) = (0, 1), corresponding to the stress pattern {1,2}. This model thus shows none of the desired properties discussed in ?3.2, except that {1,2} corresponds to a stable state.
9The sixth possible model ( no coupling , no mistransmission ) is a special case of Model 1, resulting in the identity map : ? t+1 = ? t , ? t+1 = ? t.
1023 4.2 Model 2: Coupling by constraint Motivated by the evidence for English speakers ? productive knowledge of Ross ? Generalization (?2.2), we consider a second learning model in which the learner attempts to probability match as above , but the (?? t , ?? t ) learned must satisfy the constraint that ??? stress be more probable in the
V form than in the N form.
Formally , the learner chooses (?? t , ?? t ) satisfying a quadratic optimization problem : minimize [(?? kt1
N1 )2 + (? ? kt2
N2 )2] s.t . ? ? ?
This corresponds to the following algorithm , A2: 1. If k t < k t , set ?? t = kt1
N1 , ?? t = kt2
N2 .
2. Otherwise , set ?? t = ?? t = 12 ( kt1
N1 + k t )
The resulting evolution equations can be shown to be ? t+1 = ? t +
A
A where A = ? k1
N1 > k2N2
PB(k t 1, k t 2)( kt1
N1 ? kt2
N2 ).
Dynamics Adding the equations in (5) gives that the (? t , ? t ) trajectories are lines of constant ? t + ? t ( Fig . 2). All (0, x ) and ( x , 1) ( x?[0, 1]) are stable fixed points.
1.0 1.00 of Model 2
This model thus has stable FPs corresponding to {1,1}, {1,2}, and {2,2}, does not have {2,1} as a stable FP ( by construction ), and allows for stable variation in exactly one of N or V . It does not have bifurcations , or the observed patterns of change and frequency dependence.
4.3 Model 3: Coupling by constraint , with mistransmission We now assume that each example is subject to mistransmission , as in Model 1; the learner then applies A2 to the heard examples . The evolution equations are thus the same as in (5), but with ? t?1 and ? t?1 changed to pN,t , pV,t ( Eqn . 1).
Dynamics There is a single , stable fixed point , corresponding to stable variation in both N and V.
This model thus shows none of the desired properties , except that {2,1} is not a stable FP ( by construction).
4.4 Model 4: Coupling by priors
The type of coupling assume in Models 2?3 ? a constraint on the relative probability of ??? stress for N and V forms ? has the drawback that there is no way for the rest of the lexicon to affect a pair?s N and V stress probabilities : there can be no influence of the stress of other N/V pairs , or in the lexicon as a whole , on the N/V pair being learned.
Models 4?5 allow such influence by formalizing a simple intuitive explanation for the lack of {2, 1} N/V pairs : learners cannot hypothesize a {2, 1} pair because there is no support for this pattern in their lexicons.
We now assume that learners compute the probabilities of each possible N/V pair stress pattern , rather than separate probabilities for the N and V forms . We assume that learners keep two sets of probabilities ( for {1, 1}, {1, 2}, {2, 1}, {2, 2}): 1. Learned probabilities : ~ P=(P11, P12, P22, P21), where
P11 =
N1?kt1
N1
N2?kt2
N2 , P12 =
N1?kt1
N1 kt2
N2
P22 = kt1
N1 kt2
N2 , P21 = kt1
N1
N2?kt2
N2 2. Prior probabilities : ~? = (?11, ?12, ?21, ?22), based on the support for each stress pattern in the lexicon.
The learner then produces N forms as follows : 1. Pick a pattern { n1, v1} according to ~ P .
2. Pick a pattern { n2, v2} according to ~? 3. Repeat 1?2 until n1=n2, then produce N=n1.
V forms are produced similarly , but checking whether v1 = v2 at step 3. Learners ? production of an N/V pair is thus influenced by both their learning experience ( for the particular N/V pair ) and by how much support exists in their lexicon for the different stress patterns.
We leave the exact interpretation of the ? ij ambiguous ; they could be the percentage of N/V pairs already learned which follow each stress pattern , for example . Motivated by the absence of {2,1} N/V pairs in English , we assume that ?21 = 0.
1024
By following the production algorithm above , the learner?s probabilities of producing N and V forms as ??? are : ?? t = ??( k t 1, k t 2) = ?22P22 ?11P11 + ?12P12 + ?22P22 (6) ?? t = ??( k t 1, k t 2) = ?12P12 + ?22P22 ?11P11 + ?12P12 + ?22P22 (7)
Eqns . 6?7 are undefined when ( kt1, k t 2)=(N1, 0); in this case we set ??( N1, 0) = ?22 and ??( N1, 0) = ?12 + ?22.
The evolution equations are then ? t = E(??t ) =
N1? k1=0
N2? k2=0
PB(k1, k2)??(k1, k2) (8) ? t = E(??t ) =
N1? k1=0
N2? k2=0
PB(k1, k2)??(k1, k2) (9)
Dynamics The fixed points of (8?9) are (0, 0), (0, 1), and (1, 1); their stabilities depend on N1,
N2, and ~?. Define
R = (
N2 1 + ( N2 ? 1) ?12 ?11 )(
N1 1 + ( N1 ? 1) ?12 ?22 ) (10)
There are 6 regions of parameter space in which different FPs are stable : 1. ?11, ?22 < ?12: (0, 1) stable 2. ?22 > ?12, R < 1: (0, 1), (1, 1) stable 3. ?11 < ?12 < ?22, R > 1: (1, 1) stable 4. ?11, ?22 > ?12: (0, 0), (1, 1) stable 5. ?22 < ?12 < ?11, R > 1: (0, 0) stable 6. ?11 > ?12, R < 1: (0, 0), (0, 1) stable The parameter space is split into these regimes by three hyperplanes : ?11=?12, ?22=?12, and
R=1. Given that ?21=0, ?12 = 1 ? ?11 ? ?22, and the parameter space is 4-dimensional : (?11, ?22, N1, N2). Fig . 3 shows An example phase diagram in (?11, ?2), with N1 and N2 fixed.
The bifurcation structure implies all 6 possible changes between the three FPs ({1,1}??{1,2}, {1,2}??{2,2}, {2,2}??{1,2}). For example , suppose the system is at stable FP (1, 1) ( corresponding to {2,2}) in region 2. As ?22 is decreased , we move into region 1, (1, 1) becomes unstable , and the system shifts to stable FP (0, 1). This transition corresponds to change from {2,2} to {1,2}.
Note that change to {1,2} entails crossing the hyperplanes ?12=?22 and ?12=?11. These hyperplanes do not change as N1 and N2 vary , so 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0?110.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 ? 22 Model 4, with N1 = 5, N2 = 10. Numbers are regions of parameter space ( see text).
change to {1,2} is not frequency-dependent . However , change from {1,2} entails crossing the hyperplane R=1, which does change as N1 and N2 vary ( Eqn . 10), so change from {1,2} is frequency-dependent . Thus , although there is frequency dependence in this model , it is not as observed in the diachronic data , where change to {1,2} is frequency-dependent.
Finally , no stable variation is possible : in every stable state , all members of the population categorically use a single stress pattern . {2,1} is never a stable FP , by construction.
4.5 Model 5: Coupling by priors , with mistransmission We now suppose that each example from a learner?s data is possibly mistransmitted , as in Model 1; the learner then applies the algorithm from Model 4 to the heard examples ( instead of using kt1, k t 2) . The evolution equations are thus the same as (8?9), but with ? t?1 and ? t?1 changed to pN,t , pV,t ( Eqn . 1).
Dynamics (0, 1) is always a fixed point . For some regions of parameter space , there can be one fixed point of the form (?, 1), as well as one fixed point of the form (0, ?), where ?, ? ? (0, 1). Define R ? = (1? p)(1? q)R , ??12 = ?12, and ??11 = ?11(1?q

There are 6 regions of parameter space corresponding to different stable FPs , identical to the 6 regions in Model 4, with the following substitu-0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0

Figure 4: Example of fallingN1 triggering change from (1, 1) to (0, 1) for Model 5. Dashed line = stable FP of the form (?, 1), solid line = stable FP (0, 1). ForN1 > 4, there is a stable FP near (1, 1).
For N1 < 2, (0, 1) is the only stable FP . ?22 = 0.58, ?12 = 0.4, N2 = 10, p = q = 0.05.
tions made : R ? R ?, ? ij ? ?? ij , (0, 0) ? (0, ?), (1, 1)? (?, 1).
The parameter space is again split into these regions by three hyperplanes : ??11=? ? 12, ? ? 22=? ? 12, andR?=1. As in Model 4, the bifurcation structure implies all 6 possible changes between the three FPs . However , change to {1,2} entails crossing the hyperplanes ??11=? ? 12 and ? ? 2=? ? 12, and is thus now frequency dependent.
In particular , consider a system at a stable FP (?, 1), for some N/V pair . This FP becomes unstable if ??22 becomes smaller than ? ? 12. Assuming that the ? ij are fixed , this occurs only if N1 falls below a critical value , N?1 = (1? ?22 ?12 (1? p))?1; the system would then transition to (0, 1), the only stable state . By a similar argument , falling frequency can lead to change from (0, ?) to (0, 1).
Falling frequency can thus cause change to {1,2} in this model , as seen in the N/V data ; Fig . 4 shows an example.
Unlike in Model 4, stable variation of the type seen in the N/V stress trajectories ? one of N or V stably varying , but not both ? is possible for some parameter values . (0, 0) and (1, 1) ( corresponding to {1,1} and {2,2}) are technically never possible , but effectively occur for FPs of the form (?, 0) and (?, 1) when ? or ? are small . {2,1} is never a stable FP , by construction.
This model thus arguably shows all of the desired properties seen in the N/V data.

N/V pair stress.
Based on this set of models , we are able to make some observations about the effect of different assumptions about learning by individuals on population-level dynamics . Models including asymmetric mistransmission (1, 3, 5) generally do not lead to stable states in which the entire population uses {1,1} or {2,2}. ( In Model 5, stable variation very near {1,1} or {2,2} is possible .) However , {1,1} and {2,2} are diachronically very stable stress patterns , suggesting that at least for this model set , assuming mistransmission in the learner is problematic . Models 2?3, where analogy is implemented as a hard constraint based on Ross ? generalization , do not give most desired properties . Models 4?5, where analogy is implemented as prior probabilities over N/V stress patterns , show crucial aspects of the observed dynamics : bifurcations corresponding to the changes observed in the stress data . Model 5 shows change to {1,2} triggered by falling frequency , a pattern observed in the stress data , and an emergent property of the model dynamics : this frequency effect is not present in Models 1 or 4, but is present in Model 5, where the learner combines mistransmission ( Model 1) with coupling by priors ( Model 4).
5 Discussion
We have developed 5 dynamical systems models for a relatively complex diachronic change , found one successful model , and were able to reason about the source of model behavior . Each model describes the diachronic , population-level consequences of assuming a particular learning algorithm for individuals . The algorithms considered change , from linguistics and psychology (?2.2).
We discuss novel contributions of this work , and future directions.
The dataset used here shows more complex dynamics , to our knowledge , than in changes previously considered in the computational literature.
By using a detailed , longitudinal dataset , we were able to strongly constrain the desired behavior of a computational model , so that the task of model building is not ? doomed to success ?. While all models show some patterns observed in the data , only one shows all such properties . We believe detailed datasets are potentially very useful for evaluating and differentiating between proposed computational models of change.
This paper is a first attempt to integrate detailed data with a range of DS models . We have only considered some schematic properties of the dynamics observed in our dataset , and used these to qualitatively compare each model?s predictions to the dynamics . Future work should consider the dynamics in more detail , develop more complex models ( for example , by relaxing the infinite-population assumption , allowing for stochastic dynamics ), and quantitatively compare model predictions and observed dynamics.
We were able to reason about how assumptions about individual learning affect population dynamics by analyzing a range of simple , related models . This approach is pursued in more depth in the larger set of models considered in ( Sonderegger , 2009). Our use of model comparison contrasts with most recent computational work on change , where a small number (1?2) of very complex models are analyzed , allowing for much more detailed models of language learning and usage than those considered here ( e.g . Choudhury et al , 2006; Minett & Wang , 2008; Baxter et al , 2009; Landsbergen , 2009). An advantage of our approach is an enhanced ability to evaluate a range of proposed causes for a particular case of language change.
By using simple models , we were able to consider a range of learning algorithms corresponding to different explanations for the observed diachronic dynamics . What makes this a useful exercise is the fundamentally nontrivial map , illustrated by Models 1?5, between individual learning and population-level dynamics . Although the type of individual learning assumed in each model was chosen with the same patterns of change in mind , and despite the simplicity of the models used , the resulting population-level dynamics differ greatly . This is an important point given that proposed explanations for change ( e.g ., mistransmission and analogy ) operate at the level of individuals , while the phenomena being explained ( patterns of change , or particular changes ) are aspects of the population-level dynamics.
