Abstract
Shortage of manually labeled data is an obstacle to supervised relation extraction methods . In this paper we investigate a graph based semisupervised learning algorithm , a label propagation ( LP ) algorithm , for relation extraction . It represents labeled and unlabeled examples and their distances as the nodes and the weights of edges of a graph , and tries to obtain a labeling function to satisfy two constraints : 1) it should be fixed on the labeled nodes , 2) it should be smooth on the whole graph.
Experiment results on the ACE corpus showed that this LP algorithm achieves better performance than SVM when only very few labeled examples are available , and it also performs better than bootstrapping for the relation extraction task.
1 Introduction
Relation extraction is the task of detecting and classifying relationships between two entities from text . Many machine learning methods have been proposed to address this problem , e.g ., supervised learning algorithms ( Miller et al , 2000; Zelenko et al ., 2002; Culotta and Soresen , 2004; Kambhatla , 2004; Zhou et al , 2005), semisupervised learning algorithms ( Brin , 1998; Agichtein and Gravano , 2000; Zhang , 2004), and unsupervised learning algorithms ( Hasegawa et al , 2004).
Supervised methods for relation extraction perform well on the ACE Data , but they require a large amount of manually labeled relation instances . Unsupervised methods do not need the definition of relation types and manually labeled data , but they cannot detect relations between entity pairs and its result cannot be directly used in many NLP tasks since there is no relation type label attached to each instance in clustering result . Considering both the availability of a large amount of untagged corpora and direct usage of extracted relations , semisupervised learning methods has received great attention.
DIPRE ( Dual Iterative Pattern Relation Expansion ) ( Brin , 1998) is a bootstrapping-based system that used a pattern matching system as classifier to exploit the duality between sets of patterns and relations . Snowball ( Agichtein and Gravano , 2000) is another system that used bootstrapping techniques for extracting relations from unstructured text . Snowball shares much in common with DIPRE , including the employment of the bootstrapping framework as well as the use of pattern matching to extract new candidate relations . The third system approaches relation classification problem with bootstrapping on top of SVM , proposed by Zhang (2004). This system focuses on the ACE subproblem , RDC , and extracts various lexical and syntactic features for the classification task . However , Zhang (2004)?s method doesn?t actually ? detect ? re-laitons but only performs relation classification between two entities given that they are known to be related.
Bootstrapping works by iteratively classifying unlabeled examples and adding confidently classified examples into labeled data using a model learned from augmented labeled data in previous iteration . It labeled examples is not fully explored in this bootstrapping process.
Recently a promising family of semisupervised learning algorithm is introduced , which can effectively combine unlabeled data with labeled data in learning process by exploiting manifold structure ( cluster structure ) in data ( Belkin and Niyogi , 2002; Blum and Chawla , 2001; Blum et al , 2004; Zhu and Ghahramani , 2002; Zhu et al , 2003). These graphbased semisupervised methods usually define a graph where the nodes represent labeled and unlabeled examples in a dataset , and edges ( may be weighted ) reflect the similarity of examples . Then one wants a labeling function to satisfy two constraints at the same time : 1) it should be close to the given labels on the labeled nodes , and 2) it should be smooth on the whole graph . This can be expressed in a regularization framework where the first term is a loss function , and the second term is a regularizer . These methods differ from traditional semisupervised learning methods in that they use graph structure to smooth the labeling function.
To the best of our knowledge , no work has been done on using graph based semisupervised learning algorithms for relation extraction . Here we investigate a label propagation algorithm ( LP ) ( Zhu and Ghahramani , 2002) for relation extraction task . This algorithm works by representing labeled and unlabeled examples as vertices in a connected graph , then propagating the label information from any vertex to nearby vertices through weighted edges iteratively , finally inferring the labels of unlabeled examples after the propagation process converges . In this paper we focus on the ACE RDC task1.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows . Section 2 presents related work . Section 3 formulates relation extraction problem in the context of semisupervised learning and describes our proposed approach . Then we provide experimental results of our proposed method and compare with a popular supervised learning algorithm ( SVM ) and bootstrapping algorithm in Section 4. Finally we conclude our work in section 5.
1 http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Projects/ACE /, Three tasks of ACE program : Entity Detection and Tracking ( EDT ), Relation Detection and Characterization ( RDC ), and Event Detection and Characterization ( EDC ) 2 The Proposed Method 2.1 Problem Definition The problem of relation extraction is to assign an appropriate relation type to an occurrence of two entity pairs in a given context . It can be represented as follows:
R ? ( Cpre , e1, Cmid , e2, Cpost ) (1) where e1 and e2 denote the entity mentions , and Cpre,Cmid,and Cpost are the contexts before , between and after the entity mention pairs . In this paper , we set the mid-context window as the words between the two entity mentions and the pre - and post-context as up to two words before and after the corresponding entity mention.
Let X = { xi}ni=1 be a set of contexts of occurrences of all the entity mention pairs , where xi represents the contexts of the ith occurrence , and n is the total number of occurrences . The first l examples ( or contexts ) are labeled as yg ( yg ? { rj}Rj=1, rj denotes relation type and R is the total number of relation types ). The remaining u(u = n ? l ) examples are unlabeled.
Intuitively , if two occurrences of entity mention pairs have the similarity context , they tend to hold the same relation type . Based on the assumption , we define a graph where the vertices represent the contexts of labeled and unlabeled occurrences of entity mention pairs , and the edge between any two vertices xi and xj is weighted so that the closer the vertices in some distance measure , the larger the weight associated with this edge . Hence , the weights are defined as follows:
Wij = exp (? s2ij ?2 ) (2) where sij is the similarity between xi and xj calculated by some similarity measures , e.g ., cosine similarity , and ? is used to scale the weights . In this paper , we set ? as the average similarity between labeled examples from different classes.
2.2 A Label Propagation Algorithm
In the LP algorithm , the label information of any vertex in a graph is propagated to nearby vertices through weighted edges until a global stable stage is achieved . Larger edge weights allow labels to travel more likely they have similar labels.
We define soft label as a vector that is a probabilistic distribution over all the classes . In the label propagation process , the soft label of each initial labeled example is clamped in each iteration to replenish label sources from these labeled data . Thus the labeled data act like sources to push out labels through unlabeled data . With this push from labeled examples , the class boundaries will be pushed through edges with large weights and settle in gaps along edges with small weights . Hopefully , the values of Wij across different classes would be as small as possible and the values of Wij within the same class would be as large as possible . This will make label propagation to stay within the same class . This label propagation process will make the labeling function smooth on the graph.
Define an n ? n probabilistic transition matrix T
Tij = P ( j ? i ) = wij?n k=1 wkj (3) where Tij is the probability to jump from vertex xj to vertex xi . We define a n ? R label matrix Y , where Yij representing the probabilities of vertex yi to have the label rj .
Then the label propagation algorithm consists the following main steps:
Step1 : Initialization ? Set the iteration index t = 0; ? Let Y 0 be the initial soft labels attached to each vertex , where Y 0ij = 1 if yi is label rj and 0 otherwise.
? Let Y 0L be the top l rows of Y 0 and Y 0U be the remaining u rows . Y 0L is consistent with the labeling in labeled data and the initialization of Y 0U can be arbitrary.
Step 2 : Propagate the labels of any vertex to nearby vertices by Y t+1 = TY t , where T is the row-normalized matrix of T , i.e.
Tij = Tij / ? k Tik , which can maintain the class probability interpretation.
Step 3 : Clamp the labeled data , that is , replace the top l row of Y t+1 with Y 0L .
Step 4 : Repeat from step 2 until Y converges.
Step 5 : Assign xh(l + 1 ? h ? n ) with a label : yh = argmaxjYhj .
The above algorithm can ensure that the labeled data YL never changes since it is clamped in Step 3.
Actually we are interested in only YU . This algorithm has been shown to converge to a unique solution Y?U = limt ?? Y tU = ( I ? T?uu)?1T?ulY 0L ( Zhu and Ghahramani , 2002). Here , T?uu and T?ul are acquired by splitting matrix T ? after the lth row and the lth column into 4 submatrices . And I is u ? u identity matrix . We can see that the initialization of Y 0U in this solution is not important , since Y 0U does not affect the estimation of Y?U .
3 Experiments and Results 3.1 Feature Set Following ( Zhang , 2004), we used lexical and syntactic features in the contexts of entity pairs , which are extracted and computed from the parse trees derived from Charniak Parser ( Charniak , 1999) and the Chunklink script 2 written by Sabine Buchholz from
Tilburg University.
Words : Surface tokens of the two entities and words in the three contexts.
Entity Type : the entity type of both entity mentions , which can be PERSON , ORGANIZA-
TION , FACILITY , LOCATION and GPE.
POS features : Part-Of-Speech tags corresponding to all tokens in the two entities and words in the three contexts.
Chunking features : This category of features are extracted from the chunklink representation , which includes : ? Chunk tag information of the two entities and words in the three contexts . The ?0? tag means that the word is not in any chunk . The ? I-XP ? tag means that this word is inside an XP chunk . The ? BXP ? by default means that the word is at the beginning of an XP chunk.
? Grammatical function of the two entities and words in the three contexts . The 2Software available at http://ilk.uvt.nl/?sabine/chunklink / the function of the head is the function of the whole chunk . ? NP-SBJ ? means a NP chunk as the subject of the sentence . The other words in a chunk that are not the head have ? NOFUNC ? as their function.
? IOB-chains of the heads of the two entities . So-called IOB-chain , noting the syntactic categories of all the constituents on the path from the root node to this leaf node of tree.
The position information is also specified in the description of each feature above . For example , word features with position information include : 1) WE1 ( WE2): all words in e1 ( e2) 2) WHE1 ( WHE2): head word of e1 ( e2) 3) WMNULL : no words in Cmid 4) WMFL : the only word in Cmid 5) WMF , WML , WM2, WM3, ...: first word , last word , second word , third word , ... in Cmid when at least two words in Cmid 6) WEL1, WEL2, ...: first word , second word , ...
before e1 7) WER1, WER2, ...: first word , second word , ...
after e2
We combine the above lexical and syntactic features with their position information in the contexts to form context vectors . Before that , we filter out low frequency features which appeared only once in the dataset.
3.2 Similarity Measures
The similarity sij between two occurrences of entity pairs is important to the performance of the LP algorithm . In this paper , we investigated two similarity measures , cosine similarity measure and Jensen-Shannon ( JS ) divergence ( Lin , 1991). Cosine similarity is commonly used semantic distance , which measures the angle between two feature vectors . JS divergence has ever been used as distance measure for document clustering , which outperforms cosine similarity based document clustering ( Slonim et al , 2002). JS divergence measures the distance between two probability distributions if feature vector is considered as probability distribution over features . JS divergence is defined as follows : Table 1: Frequency of Relation SubTypes in the ACE training and devtest corpus.

3.3 Experimental Evaluation 3.3.1 Experiment Setup We evaluated this label propagation based relation extraction method for relation subtype detection and characterization task on the official ACE 2003 corpus . It contains 519 files from sources including broadcast , newswire , and newspaper . We dealt with only intra-sentence explicit relations and assumed that all entities have been detected beforehand in the EDT subtask of ACE . Table 1 lists the types and subtypes of relations for the ACE Relation Detection and Characterization ( RDC ) task , along with their The LP algorithm is run with two similarity measures : cosine similarity and JS divergence.

NONE ? class . We used the remaining examples in the ACE training set and the whole ACE test set as unlabeled data . The testing set was used for final evaluation.
3.3.2 LP vs . SVM
Support Vector Machine ( SVM ) is a state of the art technique for relation extraction task . In this experiment , we use LIBSVM tool 3 with linear kernel function.
For comparison between SVM and LP , we ran SVM and LP with different sizes of labeled data and evaluate their performance on unlabeled data using precision , recall and Fmeasure . Firstly , we ran SVM or LP algorithm to detect possible relations from unlabeled data . If an entity mention pair is classified not to the ? NONE ? class but to the other 24 subtype classes , then it has a relation . Then construct labeled datasets with different sampling set size l , including 1%?Ntrain , 10%?Ntrain , 25%? Ntrain , 50%?Ntrain , 75%?Ntrain , 100%?Ntrain ( Ntrain is the number of examples in the ACE train-3LIBSVM : a library for support vector machines . Software available at http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/?cjlin/libsvm.
ing set ). If any relation subtype was absent from the sampled labeled set , we redid the sampling . For each size , we performed 20 trials and calculated average scores on test set over these 20 random trials.
Table 2 reports the performance of SVM and LP with different sizes of labled data for relation detection task . We used the same sampled labeled data in
LP as the training data for SVM model.
From Table 2, we see that both LPCosine and LPJS achieve higher Recall than SVM . Specifically , with small labeled dataset ( percentage of labeled data ? 25%), the performance improvement by LP is significant . When the percentage of labeled data increases from 50% to 100%, LPCosine is still comparable to SVM in Fmeasure while LPJS achieves slightly better Fmeasure than SVM . On the other hand , LPJS consistently outperforms LPCosine.
Table 3 reports the performance of relation classification by using SVM and LP with different sizes of labled data . And the performance describes the average values of Precision , Recall and Fmeasure over major relation subtypes.
From Table 3, we see that LPCosine and LPJS outperform SVM by Fmeasure in almost all settings of labeled data , which is due to the increase of Recall . With smaller labeled dataset ( percentage of labeled data ? 50%), the gap between LP and SVM is larger . When the percentage of labeled data in-0.3 0.35 0.4 0.45 0.5 0.55 0.6 1% 10% 25% 50% 75% 100%

On the other hand , the LP algorithm based on JS divergence consistently outperforms the LP algorithm based on Cosine similarity . Figure 1 visualizes the accuracy of three algorithms.
As shown in Figure 1, the gap between SVM curve and LPJS curves is large when the percentage of labeled data is relatively low.
3.3.3 An Example
In Figure 2, we selected 25 instances in training set and 15 instances in test set from the ACE corpus,which covered five relation types . Using Isomap tool 4, the 40 instances with 229 feature dimensions are visualized in a two-dimensional space as the figure . We randomly sampled only one labeled example for each relation type from the 25 training examples as labeled data . Figure 2(a ) and 2(b ) show the initial state and ground truth result respectively . Figure 2(c ) reports the classification result on test set by SVM ( accuracy = 415 = 26.7%), and Figure 2(d ) gives the classification result on both training set and test set by LP ( accuracy = 1115 = 73.3%).
Comparing Figure 2(b ) and Figure 2(c ), we find that many examples are misclassified from class ? to other class symbols . This may be caused that SVMs method ignores the intrinsic structure in data.
For Figure 2(d ), the labels of unlabeled examples are determined not only by nearby labeled examples , but also by nearby unlabeled examples , so using LP 4The tool is available at http://isomap.stanford.edu/.

strategy achieves better performance than the local consistency based SVM strategy when the size of labeled data is quite small.
3.3.4 LP vs . Bootstrapping
In ( Zhang , 2004), they perform relation classification on ACE corpus with bootstrapping on top of SVM . To compare with their proposed Bootstrapped SVM algorithm , we use the same feature stream setting and randomly selected 100 instances from the training data as the size of initial labeled data.
Table 4 lists the performance of the bootstrapped SVM method from ( Zhang , 2004) and LP method with 100 seed labeled examples for relation type classification task . We can see that LP algorithm outperforms the bootstrapped SVM algorithm on four relation type classification tasks , and perform comparably on the relation ? SOC ? classification task.
4 Discussion
In this paper,we have investigated a graphbased semisupervised learning approach for relation extraction problem . Experimental results showed that the LP algorithm performs better than SVM and labeled examples for relation type classification task.

We have some findings from these results : The LP based relation extraction method can use the graph structure to smooth the labels of unlabeled examples . Therefore , the labels of unlabeled examples are determined not only by the nearby labeled examples , but also by nearby unlabeled examples.
For supervised methods , e.g ., SVM , very few labeled examples are not enough to reveal the structure of each class . Therefore they can not perform well , since the classification hyperplane was learned only from few labeled data and the coherent structure in unlabeled data was not explored when inferring class boundary . Hence , our LP-based semisupervised method achieves better performance on both relation detection and classification when only few labeled data is available . Bootstrapping Currently most of works on the RDC task of ACE focused on supervised learning methods Culotta and Soresen (2004; Kambhatla (2004; Zhou et al (2005). Table 5 lists a comparison on relation detection and classification of these methods . Zhou et al (2005) reported the best result as 63.1%/49.5%/55.5% in Precision/Recall/F-measure on the relation subtype classification using feature based method , which outperforms tree kernel based method by Culotta and Soresen (2004). Compared with Zhou et al?s method , the performance of LP algorithm is slightly lower . It may be due to that we used a much simpler feature set . Our work in this paper focuses on the investigation of a graph based semisupervised learning algorithm for relation extraction . In the future , we would like to use more effective feature sets Zhou et al (2005) or kernel based similarity measure with LP for relation extraction.
5 Conclusion and Future Work
This paper approaches the problem of semisupervised relation extraction using a label propagation algorithm . It represents labeled and unlabeled examples and their distances as the nodes and the weights of edges of a graph , and tries to obtain a labeling function to satisfy two constraints : 1) it should be fixed on the labeled nodes , 2) it should be smooth on the whole graph . In the classification process , the labels of unlabeled examples are determined not only by nearby labeled examples , but also by nearby unlabeled examples . Our experimental results demonstrated that this graph based algorithm can achieve better performance than SVM when only very few labeled examples are available , and also outperforms the bootstrapping method for relation extraction task.
In the future , we would like to investigate more effective feature set or use feature selection to improve the performance of this graphbased semisupervised relation extraction method.
