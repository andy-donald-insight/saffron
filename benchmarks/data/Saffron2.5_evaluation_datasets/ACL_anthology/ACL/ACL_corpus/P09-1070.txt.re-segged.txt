Abstract
This paper presents a set of Bayesian methods for automatically extending the
WORDNET ontology with new concepts and annotating existing concepts with generic property fields , or attributes . We base our approach on Latent Dirichlet Allocation and evaluate along two dimensions : (1) the precision of the ranked lists of attributes , and (2) the quality of the attribute assignments to WORDNET concepts . In all cases we find that the principled LDA-based approaches outperform previously proposed heuristic methods , greatly improving the specificity of attributes at each concept.
1 Introduction
We present a Bayesian approach for simultaneously extending IsA hierarchies such as those found in WORDNET ( WN ) ( Fellbaum , 1998) with additional concepts , and annotating the resulting concept graph with attributes , i.e ., generic property fields shared by instances of that concept . Examples of attributes include ? height ? and ? eye-color ? for the concept Person or ? gdp ? and ? president ? for Country . Identifying and extracting such attributes relative to a set of flat ( i.e ., non-hierarchically organized ) labeled classes of instances has been extensively studied , using a variety of data , e.g ., Web search query logs ( Pas?ca and Van Durme , 2008), Web documents ( Yoshinaga and Torisawa , 2007), and Wikipedia ( Suchanek et al ., 2007; Wu and Weld , 2008).
Building on the current state of the art in attribute extraction , we propose a model-based approach for mapping flat sets of attributes annotated with class labels into an existing ontology.
This inference problem is divided into two main components : (1) identifying the appropriate parent concept for each labeled class and (2) learning ? Contributions made during an internship at Google.
the correct level of abstraction for each attribute in the extended ontology . For example , consider the task of annotating WN with the labeled class renaissance painters containing the class instances Pisanello , Hieronymus Bosch , and Jan van Eyck and associated with the attributes ? famous works ? and ? style .? Since there is no WN concept for renaissance painters , the latter would need to be mapped into WN under , e.g ., Painter . Furthermore , since ? famous works ? and ? style ? are not specific to renaissance painters ( or even the WN concept Painter ), they should be placed at the most appropriate level of abstraction , e.g ., Artist.
In this paper , we show that both of these goals can be realized jointly using a probabilistic topic model , namely hierarchical Latent Dirichlet Allocation ( LDA ) ( Blei et al , 2003b).
There are three main advantages to using a topic model as the annotation procedure : (1) Unlike hierarchical clustering ( Duda et al , 2000), the attribute distribution at a concept node is not composed of the distributions of its children ; attributes found specific to the concept Painter would not need to appear in the distribution of attributes for Person , making the internal distributions at each concept more meaningful as attributes specific to that concept ; (2) Since LDA is fully Bayesian , its model semantics allow additional prior information to be included , unlike standard models such as Latent Semantic Analysis ( Hofmann , 1999), improving annotation precision ; (3) Attributes with multiple related meanings ( i.e ., polysemous attributes ) are modeled implicitly : if an attribute ( e.g ., ? style ?) occurs in two separate input classes ( e.g ., poets and car models ), then that attribute might attach at two different concepts in the ontology , which is better than attaching it at their most specific common ancestor ( Whole ) if that ancestor is too general to be useful . However , there is also a pressure for these two occurrences to attach to a single concept.
We use WORDNET 3.0 as the specific test ontology for our annotation procedure , and evalu-sation , solubility , contraindications , side effects , chemistry , molecular weight , history , mode of action bollywood actors : biography , filmography , age , bio-data , height , profile , autobiography , new wallpapers , latest photos , family pictures citrus fruits : nutrition , health benefits , nutritional value , nutritional information , calories , nutrition facts , history european countries : population , flag , climate , president , economy , geography , currency , population density , topography , vegetation , religion , natural resources london boroughs : population , taxis , local newspapers , mp , lb , street map , renault connexions , local history microorganisms : cell structure , taxonomy , life cycle , reproduction , colony morphology , scientific name , virulence factors , gram stain , clipart renaissance painters : early life , bibliography , short biography , the david , bio , painting , techniques , homosexuality , birthplace , anatomical drawings , famous paintings Figure 1: Examples of labeled attribute sets extracted using the method from ( Pas?ca and Van
Durme , 2008).
ate three variants : (1) a fixed structure approach where each flat class is attached to WN using a simple string-matching heuristic , and concept nodes are annotated using LDA , (2) an extension of LDA allowing for sense selection in addition to annotation , and (3) an approach employing a nonparametric prior over tree structures capable of inferring arbitrary ontologies.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows : ?2 describes the full ontology annotation framework , ?3 introduces the LDA-based topic models , ?4 gives the experimental setup , ?5 gives results , ?6 gives related work and ?7 concludes.
2 Ontology Annotation
Input to our ontology annotation procedure consists of sets of class instances ( e.g ., Pisanello , Hieronymus Bosch ) associated with class labels ( e.g ., renaissance painters ) and attributes ( e.g ., ? birthplace ?, ? famous works ?, ? style ? and ? early life ?). Clusters of noun phrases ( instances ) are constructed using distributional similarity ( Lin and Pantel , 2002; Hearst , 1992) and are labeled by applying ? suchas ? surface patterns to raw Web text ( e.g ., ? renaissance painters such as Hierony-mous Bosch ?), yielding 870K instances in more than 4500 classes ( Pas?ca and Van Durme , 2008).
Attributes for each flat labeled class are extracted from anonymized Web search query logs using the minimally supervised procedure in ( Pas?ca , 2008)1. Candidate attributes are ranked based on their weighted Jaccard similarity to a set of 5 manually provided seed attributes for the 1Similar query data , including query strings and frequency counts , is available from , e.g ., ( Gao et al , 2007)

class european countries . Figure 1 illustrates several such labeled attribute sets ( the underlying instances are not depicted ). Naturally , the attributes extracted are not perfect , e.g ., ? lb ? and ? renault connexions ? as attributes for london boroughs.
We propose a set of Bayesian generative models based on LDA that take as input labeled attribute sets generated using an extraction procedure such as the above and organize the attributes in WN according to their level of generality . Annotating WN with attributes proceeds in three steps : (1) attaching labeled attribute sets to leaf concepts in WN using string distance , (2) inferring an attribute model using one of the LDA variants discussed in ? 3, and (3) generating ranked lists of attributes for each concept using the model probabilities (? 4.3).
3 Hierarchical Topic Models 3.1 Latent Dirichlet Allocation The underlying mechanism for our annotation procedure is LDA ( Blei et al , 2003b ), a fully Bayesian extension of probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis ( Hofmann , 1999). Given D labeled attribute sets wd , d ? D , LDA infers an unstructured set of T latent annotated concepts over which attribute sets decompose as mixtures.2 The latent annotated concepts represent semantically coherent groups of attributes expressed in the data , as shown in Example 1.
The generative model for LDA is given by ? d |? ? Dir (?), d ? 1 . . . D ? t |? ? Dir (?), t ? 1 . . . T zi,d|?d ? Mult(?d ), i ? 1 . . . | wd | wi,d|?zi,d ? Mult(?zi,d ), i ? 1 . . . | wd | (1) where ? and ? are hyperparameters smoothing the per-attribute set distribution over concepts and per-concept attribute distribution respectively ( see Figure 2 for the graphical model ). We are interested in the case where w is known and we want 2In topic modeling literature , attributes are words and attribute sets are documents.
621 to compute the conditional posterior of the remaining random variables p(z,?,?|w ). This distribution can be approximated efficiently using Gibbs sampling . See ( Blei et al , 2003b ) and ( Griffiths and Steyvers , 2002) for more details.
(Example 1) Given 26 labeled attribute sets falling into three broad semantic categories : philosophers , writers and actors ( e.g ., sets for contemporary philosophers , women writers , bollywood actors ), LDA is able to infer a meaningful set of latent annotated concepts : quotations teachings virtue ethics philosophies biography sayings new movies filmography official website biography email address autobiography writing style influences achievements bibliography family tree short biography ( philosopher ) ( writer ) ( actor ) ( concept labels manually added for the latent annotated concepts are shown in parentheses ). Note that with a flat concept structure , attributes can only be separated into broad clusters , so the generality/specificity of attributes cannot be inferred . Parameters were ?=1, ?=0.1, T=3.
3.2 Fixed-Structure LDA
In this paper , we extend LDA to model structural dependencies between latent annotated concepts ( cf . ( Li and McCallum , 2006; Sivic et al , 2008)); In particular , we fix the concept structure to correspond to the WN IsA hierarchy . Each labeled attribute set is assigned to a leaf concept in WN based on the edit distance between the concept label and the attribute set label . Possible latent concepts for this set include the concepts along all paths from its attachment point to the WN root , following IsA relation edges . Therefore , any two labeled attribute sets share a number of latent concepts based on their similarity in WN : all labeled attribute sets share at least the root concept , and may share more concepts depending on their most specific , common ancestor . Under such a model , more general attributes naturally attach to latent concept nodes closer to the root , and more specific attributes attach lower ( Example 2).
Formally , we introduce into LDA an extra set of random variables cd identifying the subset of concepts in T available to attribute set d , as shown in the diagram at the middle of Figure 2.3 For example , with a tree structure , cd would be constrained to correspond to the concept nodes in T on the path from the root to the leaf containing d.
Equation 1 can be adapted to this case if the index t is taken to range over concepts applicable to attribute set d.
3Abusing notation , we use T to refer to a structured set of concepts and to refer to the number of concepts in flat LDA ( Example 2 ) Fixing the latent concept structure to correspond to WN ( dark/purple nodes ), and attaching each labeled attribute set ( examples depicted by light/orange nodes ) yields the annotated hierarchy : works picture writings history biography philosophy natural rights criticism ethics law literary criticism books essays short stories novels tattoos funeral filmography biographies net worth person philosopher writer actor scholar intellectual performer entertainerliterate communicator bollywood actors women writers contemporary philosophers Attribute distributions for the small nodes are not shown.
Dotted lines indicate multiple paths from the root , which can be inferred using sense selection . Unlike with the flat annotated concept structure , with a hierarchical concept structure , attributes can be separated by their generality.
Parameters were set at ?=1 and ?=0.1.
3.3 Sense-Selective LDA
For each labeled attribute set , determining the appropriate parent concept in WN is difficult since a single class label may be found in many different synsets ( for example , the class bollywood actors might attach to the ? thespian ? sense of Actor or the ? doer ? sense ). Fixed-hierarchy LDA can be extended to perform automatic sense selection by placing a distribution over the leaf concepts c , describing the prior probability of each possible path through the concept tree . For WN , this amounts to fixing the set of concepts to which a labeled attribute set can attach ( e.g ., restricting it to a semantically similar subset ) and assigning a probability to each concept ( e.g ., using the relative WN concept frequencies ). The probability for each sense attachment cd becomes p(cd|w , c?d , z ) ? p(wd|c,w?d , z)p(cd|c?d ), i.e ., the complete conditionals for sense selection.
p(cd|c?d ) is the conditional probability for attaching attribute set d at cd ( e.g ., simply the prior p(cd|c?d ) def = p(cd ) in the WN case ). A closed form expression for p(wd|c,w?d , z ) is derived in ( Blei et al , 2003a).
3.4 Nested Chinese Restaurant Process
In the final model , shown in the diagram on the right side of Figure 2, LDA is extended hierarchically to infer arbitrary fixed-depth tree structures selective approaches which use the WN hierarchy directly , the nCRP generates its own annotated hierarchy whose concept nodes do not necessarily correspond to WN concepts ( Example 3). Each node in the tree instead corresponds to a latent annotated concept with an arbitrary number of subconcepts , distributed according to a Dirichlet Process ( Ferguson , 1973). Due to its recursive structure , the underlying model is called the nested Chinese Restaurant Process ( nCRP ). The model in Equation 1 is extended with cd |? ? nCRP (?, L ), d ? D i.e ., latent concepts for each attribute set are drawn from an nCRP . The hyperparameter ? controls the probability of branching via the per-node Dirichlet Process , and L is the fixed tree depth.
An efficient Gibbs sampling procedure is given in ( Blei et al , 2003a).
(Example 3) Applying nCRP to the same three semantic categories : philosophers , writers and actors , yields the model : biography date of birth childhood picture family works books quotations critics poems teachings virtue ethics structuralism philosophies political theory criticism short stories style poems complete works accomplishments official website profile life story achievements filmography pictures new movies official site works ( root ) ( philosopher ) ( writer ) ( actor ) bollywood actors women writers contemporary philosophers ( manually added labels are shown in parentheses ). Unlike in WN , the inferred structure naturally places philosopher and writer under the same subconcept , which is also separate from actor . Hyperparameters were ?=0.1, ?=0.1, ?=1.0.
4 Experimental Setup 4.1 Data Analysis
We employ two data sets derived using the procedure in ( Pas?ca and Van Durme , 2008): the full set of automatic extractions generated in ? 2, and a subset consisting of all attribute sets that fall under the hierarchies rooted at the WN concepts living thing#1 ( i.e ., the first sense of living thing ), sub-stance#7, location#1, person#1, organization#1 and food#1, manually selected to cover a highprecision subset of labeled attribute sets . By comparing the results across the two datasets we can measure each model?s robustness to noise.
In the full dataset , there are 4502 input attribute sets with a total of 225K attributes (24K unique ), of which 8121 occur only once . The 10 attributes occurring in the most sets ( history , definition , pic-ture(s ), images , photos , clipart , timeline , clip art , types ) account for 6% of the total . For the subset , there are 1510 attribute sets with 76K attributes (11K unique ), of which 4479 occur only once.
4.2 Model Settings
Baseline : Each labeled attribute set is mapped to the most common WN concept with the closest label string distance ( Pas?ca , 2008). Attributes are propagated up the tree , attaching to node c if they are contained in a majority of c?s children.
LDA : LDA is used to infer a flat set of T = 300 latent annotated concepts describing the data . The concept selection smoothing parameter is set as ?=100. The smoother for the per-concept multinomial over words is set as ?=0.1.4 The effects of concept structure on attribute precision can be isolated by comparing the structured models to LDA.
Fixed-Structure LDA ( fsLDA ): The latent concept hierarchy is fixed based on WN (? 3.2), and labeled attribute sets are mapped into it as in baseline . The concept graph for each labeled attribute set wd is decomposed into ( possibly overlapping ) chains , one for each unique path from the WN root to wd?s attachment point . Each path is assigned a copy wd , reducing the bias in attribute sets with many unique ancestor concepts.5 The final models contain 6566 annotated concepts on average.
Sense-Selective LDA ( ssLDA ): For the sense selective approach (? 3.3), the set of possible sense attachments for each attribute set is taken to be all WN concepts with the lowest edit distance to its label , and the conditional probability of each sense attachment p(cd ) is set proportional to its relative frequency . This procedure results in 2 to 3 senses per attribute set on average , yielding models with 7108 annotated concepts.
Arbitrary hierarchy ( nCRP ): For the arbitrary hierarchy model (? 3.4), we set the maximum tree depth L=5, per-concept attribute smoother ?=0.05, concept assignment smoother ?=10 and nCRP branching proportion ?=1.0. The resulting 4(Parameter setting ) Across all models , the main results in this paper are robust to changes in ?. For nCRP , changes in ? and ? affect the size of the learned model but have less effect on the final precision . Larger values for L give the model more flexibility , but take longer to train.
5Reducing the directed-acyclic graph to a tree ontology did not significantly affect precision.
623 models span 380 annotated concepts on average.
4.3 Constructing Ranked Lists of Attributes Given an inferred model , there are several ways to construct ranked lists of attributes : Per-Node Distribution : In fsLDA and ssLDA , attribute rankings can be constructed directly for each WN concept c , by computing the likelihood of attribute w attaching to c , L(c|w ) = p(w|c ) averaged over all Gibbs samples ( discarding a fixed number of samples for burnin ). Since c?s attribute distribution is not dependent on the distributions of its children , the resulting distribution is biased towards more specific attributes.
Class-Entropy ( CE ): In all models , the inferred latent annotated concepts can be used to smooth the attribute rankings for each labeled attribute set.
Each sample from the posterior is composed of two components : (1) a multinomial distribution over a set of WN nodes , p(c|wd , ?) for each attribute set wd , where the ( discrete ) values of c are WN concepts , and (2) a multinomial distribution over attributes p(w|c , ?) for each WN concept c.
To compute an attribute ranking for wd , we have p(w|wd ) = ? c p(w|c , ?) p(c|wd , ?).
Given this new ranking for each attribute set , we can compute new rankings for each WN concept c by averaging again over all the wd that appear as ( possible indirect ) descendants of c . Thus , this method uses LDA to first perform reranking on the raw extractions before applying the baseline ontology induction procedure (? 4.2).6 CE ranking exhibits a ? conservation of entropy ? effect , whereby the proportion of general to specific attributes in each attribute set wd remains the same in the posterior . If set A contains 10 specific attributes and 30 generic ones , then the latter will be favored over the former in the resulting distribution 3 to 1. Conservation of entropy is a strong assumption , and in particular it hinders improving the specificity of attribute rankings.
Class-Entropy+Prior : The LDA-based models do not inherently make use of any ranking information contained in the original extractions . However , such information can be incorporated in the form of a prior . The final ranking method combines CE with an exponential prior over the attribute rank in the baseline extraction . For each attribute set , we compute the probability of each 6One simple extension is to run LDA again on the CE ranked output , yielding an iterative procedure ; however , this was not found to significantly affect precision.
attribute p(w|wd ) = plda(w|wd)pbase(w|wd ), assuming a parametric form for pbase(w|wd ) def = ? r(w,wd ). Here , r(w,wd ) is the rank of w in attribute set d . In all experiments reported , ?=0.9.
4.4 Evaluating Attribute Attachment
For the WN-based models , in addition to measuring the average precision of the reranked attributes , it is also useful to evaluate the assignment of attributes to WN concepts . For this evaluation , human annotators were asked to determine the most appropriate WN synset(s ) for a set of gold attributes , taking into account polysemous usage.
For each model , ranked lists of possible concept assignments C(w ) are generated for each attribute w , usingL(c|w ) for ranking . The accuracy of a list C(w ) for an attribute w is measured by a scoring metric that corresponds to a modification ( Pas?ca and Alfonseca , 2009) of the mean reciprocal rank score ( Voorhees and Tice , 2000):
DRR = max where rank(c ) is the rank ( from 1 up to 10) of a concept c in C(w ), and PathToGold is the length of the minimum path along IsA edges in the conceptual hierarchies between the concept c , on one hand , and any of the goldstandard concepts manually identified for the attribute w , on the other hand . The length PathToGold is 0, if the returned concept is the same as the goldstandard concept.
Conversely , a goldstandard attribute receives no credit ( that is , DRR is 0) if no path is found in the hierarchies between the top 10 concepts of C(w ) and any of the goldstandard concepts , or if C(w ) is empty . The overalll precision of a given model is the average of the DRR scores of individual attributes , computed over the gold assignment set ( Pas?ca and Alfonseca , 2009).
5 Results 5.1 Attribute Precision
Precision was manually evaluated relative to 23 concepts chosen for broad coverage.7 Table 1 shows precision at n and the Mean Average Precision ( MAP ); In all LDA-based models , the Bayes average posterior is taken over all Gibbs samples 7(Precision evaluation ) Attributes were hand annotated using the procedure in ( Pas?ca and Van Durme , 2008) and numerical precision scores (1.0 for vital , 0.5 for okay and 0.0 for incorrect ) were assigned for the top 50 attributes per concept.
25 reference concepts were originally chosen , but 2 were not populated with attributes in any method , and hence were excluded from the comparison.

after burn-in.8 The improvements in average precision are important , given the amount of noise in the raw extracted data.
When prior attribute rank information ( Per-Node and CE scores ) from the baseline extractions is not incorporated , all LDA-based models outperform the unranked baseline ( Table 1). In particular , LDA yields a 17% reduction in error ( MAP ) 8(Bayes average vs . maximum aposteriori ) The full Bayesian average posterior consistently yielded higher precision than the maximum aposteriori model . For the per-node distributions , the fsLDA Bayes average model exhibits a 17% reduction in relative error over the maximum aposteriori estimate and for ssLDA there was a 26% reduction.

over the baseline , fsLDA yields a 31% reduction , ssLDA yields a 33% reduction and nCRP yields a 48% reduction (24% reduction over fsLDA).
Performance also improves relative to the ranked baseline when prior ranking information is incorporated in the LDA-based models , as indicated by CE+Prior scores in Table 1. LDA and fsLDA reduce relative error by 6%, ssLDA by 9% and nCRP by 33%. Furthermore , nCRP precision without ranking information surpasses the baseline with ranking information , indicating robustness to extraction noise . Precision curves for individual attribute sets are shown in Figure 3. Overall , learning unconstrained hierarchies ( nCRP ) increases precision , but as the inferred node distributions do not correspond to WN concepts they cannot be used for annotation.
One benefit to using an admixture model like LDA is that each concept node in the resulting model contains a distribution over attributes specific only to that node ( in contrast to , e.g ., hierarchical agglomerative clustering ). Although absolute precision is lower as more general attributes have higher average precision ( Per-Node scores in Table 1), these distributions are semantically meaningful in many cases ( Figure 4) and furthermore can be used to calculate concept assignment precision for each attribute.9 9Per-node distributions ( and hence DRR ) were not evalu-sets . Ranked lists of attributes are generated using the CE+Prior method.
5.2 Concept Assignment Precision
The precision of assigning attributes to various concepts is summarized in Table 2. Two scores are given : all measures DRR relative to the entire gold assignment set , and found measures DRR only for attributes with DRR(w)>0. Comparing the scores gives an estimate of whether coverage or precision is responsible for differences in scores . fsLDA and ssLDA both yield a 20% reduction in relative error (17.2% increase in absolute DRR ) over the unranked baseline and a 17.2% reduction (14.2% absolute increase ) over the ranked baseline.
5.3 Subset Precision and DRR
Precision scores for the manually selected subset of extractions are given in the second half of Table 1. Relative to the unranked baseline , fsLDA and nCRP yield 42% and 44% reductions in error respectively , and relative to the ranked baseline they both yield a 21.4% reduction . In terms of absolute precision , there is no benefit to adding in prior ranking knowledge to fsLDA or nCRP , indicating diminishing returns as average baseline precision increases ( Baseline vs . fsLDA/nCRP CE scores ). Broken down across each of the subhierarchies , LDA helps in all cases except food.
DRR scores for the subset are given in the lower half of Table 2. Averaged over all gold test attributes , DRR scores double when using fsLDA.
These results can be misleading , however , due to artificially low coverage . Hence , Table 2 also shows DRR scores broken down over each subhierarchy , In this case fsLDA more than doubles the DRR relative to the baseline for substance and location , and triples it for organization and food.
ated for LDA or nCRP , because they are not mapped to WN.
6 Related Work
A large body of previous work exists on extending WORDNET with additional concepts and instances ( Snow et al , 2006; Suchanek et al , 2007); these methods do not address attributes directly.
Previous literature in attribute extraction takes advantage of a range of data sources and extraction procedures ( Chklovski and Gil , 2005; Tokunaga et al , 2005; Pas?ca and Van Durme , 2008; Yoshinaga and Torisawa , 2007; Probst et al , 2007; Van Durme et al , 2008; Wu and Weld , 2008). However these methods do not address the task of determining the level of specificity for each attribute.
The closest studies to ours are ( Pas?ca , 2008), implemented as the baseline method in this paper ; and ( Pas?ca and Alfonseca , 2009), which relies on heuristics rather than formal models to estimate the specificity of each attribute.
7 Conclusion
This paper introduced a set of methods based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation ( LDA ) for jointly extending the WORDNET ontology and annotating its concepts with attributes ( see Figure 4 for the end result ). LDA significantly outperformed a previous approach both in terms of the concept assignment precision ( i.e ., determining the correct level of generality for an attribute ) and the mean-average precision of attribute lists at each concept ( i.e ., filtering out noisy attributes from the base extraction set ). Also , relative precision of the attachment models was shown to improve significantly when the raw extraction quality increased , showing the longterm viability of the approach.

Light/orange nodes represent labeled attribute sets attached to WN , and the full hypernym graph is given for each in dark/purple nodes . White nodes depict the top attributes predicted for each WN concept . These inferred annotations exhibit a high degree of concept specificity , naturally becoming more general at higher levels of the ontology . Some annotations , such as for the concepts Agent , Substance , Living Thing and Person have high precision and specificity while others , such as Liquor and Actor need improvement . Overall , the more general concepts yield better annotations as they are averaged over many labeled attribute sets , reducing noise . 627
