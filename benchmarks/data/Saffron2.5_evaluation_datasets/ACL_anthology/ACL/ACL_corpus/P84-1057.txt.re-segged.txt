Analysts grammar of Japanese tn the Mu-proJectts presented  , It is emphasized that rules expressing constra ints on stngle linguistic structures and rules for selecting the most prefer ab lereadtngs are completely different In nature  , and that rules for selecting preferale readings should be utilized tn analysts grammars of practical HT systems  . It ts also clatmed that procedural controlts essential tn integrating such rules tn to a un ified grammar  . Some sample rules are gtven to make the points of discussion clear and concrete  . 
1. Introduction
The Hu-ProJectts a Japanese nattonal project supported by grants from the Special Coordinat ion Funds for Promoting Science & Technology of STA  ( Sctence and Technology Agency )  . whl chatms to develop Japanese-English and English-Japanese machine translation systems  . Vecurrently restrict the domain of trans lation to abstracts of scientific and technological papers  . The systems are based on the transfer approach \ [   ;  \ ]  , and consist of three phases : analysts , transfer and generation . 
In thts paper , we focus on the analysts grammar of Japanese tn the Japanese-English system  . The grammar has been developed by using GRADE whichts a programming language specially designed for thts project \  [2  \ ]  . The grammar now consists of about 900 GRADE rules . The experiments so far show that the grammar works very well and ts comprehensive enough to t reat various linguistic phenomenat nabst racts  . 
In thtspaper we wtll discuss some of the basic design principles of the grammar together wtth its detatled construction  . Some examples of grammar rules and analysts resu lts wtll be shown to make the points of our discussion clear and concrete  . 
2. Procedural Grammar
There has been a prominent tendency tn recent computational linguistics to re-evaluate CFG and use t t d trectly or augment t t to analyze sentences \  [3   . 4  . 5 \ ]  . In these systems ( frameworks ) , CFG rules Independently describe constrain tsonstngle linguistic structures  , and a universal rule application mechanism automatically produces a set of posstble structures which satisfy the given constraints  . Itts well-known , however , that such sets of posstble structures often become unmanageably large  . 
Because two separate rules such as
NP . . . . . ? NP PREP-P
VP .   .   .   .   . ? VP PREP-P are usually prepared tnCFG grammars tnorder to analyze noun and verb phrases modifted by prepositional phrases  . CFG grammars provide two syntactic analyses fo rS he was given flowers by heruncle  . 
Furthermore . the ambiguity of the sentence ts doubled by the lexlcal ambiguity of " by "  . which can be read a set the raloc attve or an agent tvep reposition  . Since the two syntactic structures are recognized by comp Zet ely independent ru\]es and the semantic interpretations of " by " are given by independent processes tn the \] ater stages  . It ts difficult to compare these four readings during the ana Zysts to gtvea preference to one of these four readings  . 
A rule such as " If a sentence tspass lve and the retsa " by "- prepost ttonal phrase  , ttts often the case that the preposition a l phrase ftlls the deep agent tve case  .   ( try thts an a \] ysts first ) " seems reasonable and quite useful for choosing the most preferable interpret at ion  , buttt cannot be expressed by refining the ordinary CFG rules  . Tht sktn do fru\]ets quite differentIn nature from a CFG ru\]e  . Itts not a rule of constraint on a stng\]e \] tngutsttc structure  ( in fact . the above four readings are a \] l\]t ngulst tcal\]y posstb\]e  )   , but tttsa " heuristic " ru\]e concerned with preference of readings  , which compares several alternative analysts paths and chooses the most feast ble one  . 
Human translaters ( or humans tn general ) have many such as morphological forms of words , collocations of words , text styles , word semantics , etc . These heuristic rules are quite useful not only for increasing efficiency but also for preventing proliferation of analysts resul ts  . As Wllks\[6\]potnted out , we cannot use semant tcInformation as constra ints on stngle linguistic structures  , but Just as preference cues to choose the most feast ble Interpretations among linguisti cally posst ble Interpretations  . We clatm that many sorts of preference cues other than semantt cones exist tn real texts whtch cannot be captured by CFG rules  . 
We will show tnth tspaper that . by utilizing vartous sorts of preference cues  . our analysts grammar of Japanese can work almost determt ntstt cally to gtve the most preferable Interpretation as the ftrst output  , wtthout any extensive semanttc processing ( note that even " semant c " processing cannot dtsambtguate the above sentence  . The four readings are semantically possible . It requtres deep understanding of contexts or s ituations  , whtch we cannot expect tnapractical MT system  )  . 
In order to Integrate heuristic rules based on varous levels of cuestn to a untfted analysts grammar  , we have developed a programming langauage . 
GRADE . GRADE provt desus wtth the following facili ties  . 
Expllctt Control of Rule Appl cattons : Heur is tic rules can be ordered according to the tr strength  ( See 42 )  . 
-Nulttple Relatton Representation : Vartous levels of Informer on Including morphological  . 
syntactic , semantic , logt cal etc . are expressed tnasngle annotated tree and can be manipulated at anyttmedurtng the analysts  . Thtsts requtred not only because many heurist ic rules are based on heterogeneous levels of cues  . but also because the analysts grammar should perform semantic/logical Interpretation of sentences at the same ttme and the rules for these phases should be wrtt tentn the same framework as syntactic analysis rules  ( See 42 .  44) . 
-Lext conDrt ven Processing : We can wrtte heuri stic rules spect ftc to a stngle or a  11mtted number of words such as rules concerned wtth col locations among words  . These rules are strong tn the sense that they almost always succeed  . They are stored tn the lext con and tnvoked at appropriate times durtng the analysts wtthout decreasing efficiency  ( See 41 )  . 
-Expltct % Definition of Analysts Strategies : The whole analysts phase can bedt vtded into steps  . 
Thts makes the whole grammar efficient , natural and easy % or ead . Furthermore . strategic consideration plays an essential role tn preventing undesirable interpret at ions from betng generated  ( See 43 )  . 
3 Organization of Grammar
In thts sectton , we will give the organization of the grammar necessary for understanding the discuss on n the followng sections  . The matn components of the grammar are as fol lows  . 
(1 ) Post-Morphological Analysts ( 2 ) Determination of Scopes ( 3 ) Analysts of Stmple Noun Phrases ( 4 ) Analysts of Stmple Sentences ( 5 ) Analysts of Embedded Sentences ( Relative
Clauses )   ( 6 ) Analysts of Relationships of SentenCes ( 7 ) Analysts of Outer Cases ( 8 ) Contextual Processing ( Processing of Omttted case elements . Interpretation of ' Ha ' . etc .   )   ( 9 ) Reduction of Structures for Transfer Phase Each component conststs of from  60 to 120 
GRADE rules.
4 7 morpho-syntact tc categories are provtded for Japanese analysts  , each of whtch hast ts own lext cal descript ionformat  .  12 . 0 00 lext cal entrtes have already been prepared according to the formats  . In thts classification . Japanese nouns are categorized n to 8 subclasses according to the tr morpho-syntact tc behavtour  , and 53 semant tcmarkers are used to characterize the tr semant t c behaviour  . Each verb has a set of case frame descriptions ( CFD ) whtch correspond to different usages of the verb  . A CF Dg ves mapping rules between surface case markers  ( SCN-post postt tonal case particles are used as SCN's tnJapanese  ) and the tr deep case interpretations ( DCZ33 deep cases are used )  . DC ! of an SCM often depends on verbs so that the mapping rules are given % oCFD's of Individua l verbs  . A CFO also gtves a normal collocation between the verb and SCM's  ( postpositonal case particles )   . Oe tatled lext cal descriptions are gtven and discussed tn another paper \  [7\]   . 
The analysts results are dependency trees whtch show the semant t c relationships among tnput words  . 
4. Typtcal Steps of Analysts Grammar
In the following , we w111 take some sample rules to Illustrate our points of discussion  . 
4-; Relative Clauses
Relative clause constructions in Japanese express several different relationships between modifying clauses  ( relative clauses ) and the lrantecedents . Some relatt veclause constructions Englts h . Me classified Japanese relattve clauses Into the follow tn  9 four types , according to the relationships between clauses and their antecedents  . 
(1) Type 1: Gaps In Cases
One of the case elements of the relattve clause ts deleted and the antecedent fills the gap  . 
(2) Type 2: Gaps In Case Elements
The antecedent modifies a case element tn the clause  . That ts . a gap exists tna noun phrase tn the clause . 
(3) Type 3: Apposition
The clause describes the content of the antecedent as the Engltsh " that "- clause tn ' the tdea that the earthts round '  . 
(4) Type 4: Partlal Apposltlon
The antecedent and the clause are related by cer tain semantic/pragmatic relationships  . The relative clause of thts type doesn't have any gaps  . 
This type cannot be translated dtrectly lnto English relative clauses  . Mehave to Interpolate In English appropriate phrases or clauses whtch are Implicittn Japanese  . tnorder to express the semantic/pragmatic rela tionships between the antecedents and relat ive clauses explicitly  . In other words , gapsexts t tn the Interpolated phrases or clauses  . 
Because the above four types of relattve clauses have the same surface forms fnJapanese  .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   . ( verb ) ( noun ) . 
Relatt vef Clause Antecedent careful processing ts requtred to dst tnguts h them  ( note that the " antecedents '- modified nouns -apelocated after the relatve clauses tn Japanese  )  . A sophisticated analysis procedure has already been developed  , which fully utltzes vartous levels of heuristic cues as follows  . 
(Rule 1 ) There area 11mtted number of nouns whtch are often used as antecedents of Type  3 clauses . 
(Rule 2 ) Vhen nouns with certanse mant tc markers appeartn the relatt veclauses and those nouns are followed by one of spect flc post post t tonal case par  t4c les , the retsahtgh possibility that the relat tve clauses are Type  2  . In the following example , the word " SHORISOKUDO " ( process tn9 speed ) has the semant tcmarker AO ( attribute )   . 
\[ ex1\]\[Type2\]"SHORZSOKUDO ""GA" ( processing speed )   ( case particle : subject

RelattvetClause " HAYA\[""KEISANK\[" ( htgh ) I ( computer ) I/t
Antecedent--> ( English Translation ) A computer whose processing speedts htgh ( Rule 3 ) Nouns such as " MOKUTEKZ " ( puPpose )  . 
"GENZN "( reason ), " SHUDAN " ( method ) etc . express deep case relationships by themselves  , and . when these nouns appear as antecedents . t is often the case that they ft11 the gaps of the corresponding deep cases tn the relatt veclauses  . 
\[ ex -2 \]\[ Type 1\] "KONO " " SOUCHI "" O "" TSUKAT "" TA "" MOKUTEK\["  ( th , s)l(dev , c . ( c .   . IC purpos . ) part , cle:h/,ormat , ve:IJ

RelattvetClauseAntecedent--> ( English Translation ) The purpose for wh ch ( someone ) used thts devtce
The purpose of ustn9thts devtce ( Rule 4 ) The rets a 11mtted number of nouns whtch are often used as antecedents In Type  4 relatt veclauses . Each of such nouns requtres a specific phrase or clause to be Interpolated tnEnglts h  . 
\[ ex -3 \]\[ Type 4\] " KONO " " SOUCHI " "0" " TSUKAT " --" TA " " KEKKA " ( th , s) , ( devlce)/~case e . ~ . ( touse)/~tense ~' . . . ( ; esult ) . . . lf format , ve:hJ1 , object , I past ) I1\[I case ) l
Relattve ~ Clause Antecedent - -> ( Engllsh Translation ) The result which was obtatned by ustngthts devce In the above example  , the clause " the result whtch someone obtatned ( the result : gap ) " tsonmittedtnJapanese . whtch relates the antecedent " KEKKA " ( result ) and the relat tve clause " KONOSOUCHI 0 TSUKAT_TA " ( someone used thts devtce )  . 

A set of lext cal rules ts defined for " KEKKA " ( resul L )  . which basically works as follows : t t examines first whether the deep object case has already been filled by a noun phrase tn the relat tve clause  . If so , the relat tve clausets taken as type 4 and an appropriate phrasets Interpolated as tn \[ ex  -3  \ ]  . If not , the relat tve clausets taken as type 1 as tn the following example where the noun * KEKKA "  ( result ) ftlls the gap of object case tn the relat tve clause  . 
\ [  ex-4 \]\[ Type 1\] " KONO " " JIKKEN ?/ ? GA " . " TSUKAT ? J " TA " l " KEKKA " ( thts ) J ( expertment )  / /  ( case ~ ( to use ) ~ ( tense ( r ~ ult ) rP article ~ i forms t tve:\]l
I subJect II past ) I\[_ll case ) l/I
Relattve Clause Antecedent - -> ( English Translation ) The result whtch thts experiment used Such lex t cal rules are Invoked at the beginning of the relat tve clause analysts by a rule tn the math flow of processing  . The noun " KEKKA ? ( result ) is given a mark as a lexlcal property which Indicates the noun has special rules to be Invoked when tt appears as an antecedent of are latlve clause  .   A11 the nouns which requlrespe clal treatments In the relative clause analysts are given the same marker  . 
The rule tn the matnflow only checks thts mark and Invokes the lext cal rules defined tn the lext con  . 
(Rule 5 ) Only the cases marked by post postt tonal case par ticles ' GA '  . ' WO " and ' NI " can be deleted tn Type 1 relatt veclauses , when the antecedents are ordtnary nouns . GapstnType 1 relative clauses can have other surface case marks  , only when the antecedents are spectal nouns such as described tn 
Rule (3).
42 ConJuncted Noun Phrases
ConJuncted noun phrases often appear in abstracts of scientific and technological papers  . 
Itts Important to analyze them correctly.
especially to determine scopes of conjunctions correctly  , because they often lead to proliferation of analysis results  . The particle " TO " plays almost the same ro leastheEn gllsh " and " to conjunct noun phrases  . There are several heuristic rules based on various levels of information to determine the scopes  . 
< Scope Decision Rules of ConJuncted Noun Phrases by Partlcle ' TO '>  ( Rule1 ) Stnce part tcle " TO " ts also used as a case particle  , tf It appears tn the position :
Noun'TO " verbNoun,
Noun'TO'adjective Noun.
there are two posstble Interpretations . one tn whlch " TO " Is a case part tcle and " noun TO adjective  ( verb ) ' forms are lattve clause that modifies the second noun  . and the other one tn which " TO " tsa conjunct ivep article to form a conJuncted noun phrase  . However . itts very 11kely that the part tcle ' TO'ts not 8 conjunctive part t cle but a post-posit ional case particle  , if the adjective ( verb ) ts one of adjectives ( verbs ) which requtre case elements wtth surface case mark " TO ' and there are no extra words between " TO ? end the adjective  ( verb )   . In the following example . 
"KOTONARU ( to be different ) " ts an adjective whichts often collocated wt than oun phrase followed by case partic le"TO "  . 
\[ ex-5\]
YOSOKU-CHI"TO"KOTONARUATAI ( predicted value )   ( to be different )   ( value ) \[ dominant interpretation \]
IYOSOKU-CHI"TO"KOTONARUATIAI relattve ~ clause ant/cedent ? the value which ts diffe rent from the predicted value \[ less domtnant Interpretation \] 
YOSOKU-CHI"TO"KOTONARUATAI
MeN~IIc on Juncte ~ noun phrase = the predicted value and the different value  ( Rule2 ) If two " TO * particles appear tn the posi tion :  Noun1 ' TO ' .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   Noun2 ' TO '' NO " NOUN-3 the right boundary of the scope of the conJuct tonts almost always  Noun2  . The second ' TO " plays a role of a delimite r which delt mt ts the right boundary of the conjunction  . Thts ' TO " tSoptional , but tn real texts one often places tt to make the scope unambiguous  , especially when the second conjunct IS along noun phrase and the scope is highly ambiguous without tt  . Because the second ' TO'can be Interpreted as a case part t cle  ( not as a delimiter of the conjunction ) and ' NO' following a case part t cle turns the preceding phrase to a "  NOUN-2 TONO " ts taken asomod trter of NOUN-3 and NOUN-3 ts token as the hood noun of the second conJunt ts also linguistically possible  . However , In most cases , when two ' TO " particles appear tn the above position  , the second " TO'Is Just a delimiter of the scope  ( see\[ex-6\] )   .

( Rule5) In
Noun-!'TO '....... Noun 2.
tf Noun -! and Noun2 are not exactly the some but nouns wtth the same morphemes  , the rtght boundary nouns of the conJuncts . JISSOKU?CHI ( actual value ) and YOSOKU-CH\[ ( predtcted value )   , have the same morpheme " CH\[" ( whtch meams " value " )   . Thus , thts rule can correctly determine the scope , eventf the spectal word " KANKE 1" ( relatt on shtp ) does no text st . 
(Rule 6 ) If some spectal words ( 11 ke ' SONO "' SORE-NO ' etc . whtchroughly correspond to ' the ' . 
'1 iS ' tnEn gllsh ) appeartn the position : Phrases whtchlNoun-1 " TO '< spectal word > Noun2  . 
modtfy noun phrases the modifiers preceding Noun1 modtfy only Noun * l but not the whole conJuncted noun phrase  . 
( Rule7)\[n .   .   .   .   .   . Noun1'TO' .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   . Noun 2 . 
tf Noun1 and flour-2 belong to the same spect ftc semant t c categ or i es  , 11 Leactton nouns , abstract nouns etc , the rtght boundaryts often Noun 2 . 
( Rule8)\[nmost conJuncted noun phrases , the structures of conJuncts are well-balanced . 
Therefore , tf are lattve clause precedes the first conjunct and the length of the second conjunct  ( the number of words between ' TO " and Noun 2 ) ts short 11ke \ [ Relative Clause \] Noun1 ' TO " .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   Noun2 the relatt veclause modtftes both conJuncts , that ts . the antecedent of the relattve clausets the whole conJuncted phrase  . 
These heuristic rules are based on diffe rent levels of Information  ( some are based on surface lexlcal Items . some are based on morphemes of words , someon semant t cn formatton ) and may lead to different decisions about scopes  . However . we can distinguish strong heuristic rules  ( t . e . rules whtch almost always give correct scopes when they are applled  ) from others . In fact . there exts ts some ordertng of heuristic rules according to the tr strength  . Rules (1) .  (2) . (3), (4) and (6) . for example , almost always succeed , and rules like ( 7 ) and ( 8 ) often lead to wrong decisions . Rules 11ke ( 7 ) and ( 8 ) should be treated as default rules whtch are applted only when the other stronger rules cannot dect de the scopes  . We can deftnet nGRADE an arbitrary order tng of rule applications  . 
Thts capability of contro114ng the sequences of rule applications tsessent i alt n Integrating heuristic rules based on heterogeneous levels of Information tn to a untried set of rules  . 
Note that most of these rules cannot be naturall y expressed by ord tnary CFG rules  . Rule (2) . for example , tsa rule whtch blocks the application of the ordtnary CFG rule such as 
NP--->NP < case-particle > NON when the < case-particle>ts'TO ' and a conjunctive part t cle ' TO ' precedes thts sequence of words  . 
43 Determination of Scopes
Scopes of conJuncted noun phrases often overlap wtth scopes of relattve clauses  , whtch males the problem of scope determination more complicated  . For the surface sequence of phrases 11ke   NP1 ' TO ' NP2 < case-particle > .   .   .   .   . < verb > NP3 there are two passable scopes of conJuncted noun clause  11ke relationships between the phrase and there lattve  ( 1 ) NP1'TO"NP2 < case-particle > .   .   .   . < verb > NP 3

Thts ambiguity together with genut neambt guttest n scopes of conJuncted noun phrases tn  42 produces combinatorial Interpretations tnCFG grammars  , most of whtch are linguistically posst ble but practically unthnkable  . It Is not only In efficient but also almost Impossible to compare such an enormous number of linguistically posstble structures af ter they have been generated  .

S1S2 ( 1 ) roughly corresponds to Engllsh co-ordinate constructions  , end ( 2 ) end ( 3 ) to Engltsh sub-ordinate constructions . However . the correspondence between the forms of Japanese endEngltsh sentence connections ts not so stra ig htforward  . Some postpost tional particles tn (2) . for example , are used to express several different semantic relationships between sentences  . 
and therefore , should he translated tn to different sub -ordtnators in Engltsh according to the semantic relationships  . The post postt to nal part tcle ' TAME ' expresses either ' purpose-action " relat ionships or ' cause-effect ' relations h i ps  . In order to dtsambtguate the semantic relat ionships expressed by ' TAME '  . a set of lext cal rules ts defined in the dic tionary of " TAME '  . The rules are roughly as follows . 
(1 ) If S1 expresses a completed act to nor a stative assertion  , the relationshipts " cause-effect ' . 
(2 ) If $1 expresses neither a completed event no resta tIve assertion and  $2 expressess controllable action , the relationshipts ' purpose-action ' . 
\[ ex-e\](A ) $ 1: TOKYO-NX ( Tokyo)

Note that whether S1 expresses a completed action or not is determined tn the preceding phases verbs described tn the dictionary and aspect format tvesfollowing the verbs  ( The classification of Japanese verbs based on the traspectual features and related top tcs are discussed tn\  [8  \ ]  )   . Ve have already wrtt ten rules ( some of whtch are heuristic ones ) for 57 postpost ttonal particles for conJuct to ns of sentences  11ke ' TAME ' . 
Postpost ttonal particles for cases , whtch follow noun phrases and express case re lationships  , are also very ambiguous In the sense that they express several different deep cases  . Vhtle the Interpretation of tnner case elements are dtrectly given tn the verb dic tionary as the form of mapping between surface case part cles and the tr deep case In terp retations  . the outer case elements should be semantically Interpreted by referring to semant tccategor ies or noun phrases and properties of verbs  . 
Lext cal rules for 62 case particles have also been
Implemented and tested.

The concept of procedural granwars was original lyproposed by  Wtnograd\[9\] and Independently persued by other research groups\[lO\]  . 
However . the tr clatms have not been well appreciated by other researchers  ( or even by themselves )  . One often argues a gat nst procedural grammars , saytng that : the linguistic facts W tnograd 's grammar captures can also be expressed by ATN  . and the expressive power of ATN tsequivalent wtth that of the augmented CFG  . 
Therefore ; procedural grammars have no advantages over the augmented CFG  . They Just make the whole grammars complicated and hard to maintain  . 
The above argument , however , mtsses an
Important pont and confuses procedural grammar wtth the representation of grammars tn the form of programs  ( asShowntnVtnograd\[9\] )   . Ve showed tnth tspaper that : the rules whtch gt vestructural constraint sonftnalana lysts results and the rules whtch choose the most preferable linguistic structures  ( or the rules whtch block " garden path " struc tures  ) are different tn nature . \[ norder to Integrate the latter type of ru lest nauntfted analysts grammar  , ttts essential to control the sequence of rule applications explicitly and Introduce strategic knowledget n to grammar organizations  . Furthermore . Introduction of control specifications doesn't necessarily lead to the grammar In the form of programs  .
