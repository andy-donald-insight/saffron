The centering framework explains local coherence by relating local focus and the form of referring expressions  . 
It has proven useful in monolog , but its utility for multiparty discourse has not been shown  , and a variety of issues must be tackled to adapt he model for dialog  . This pape reports our application of three naive models of centering theory for dialog  . These results will be used as baselines for evaluating future models  . 11 Introduction The centering framework ( Grosz et al ,  1995 ) is one of the most influential computational linguistics theories relating local focus to the form chosen for referring expressions  . A number of studies have developed refinements and extensions of the theory  ( eg . Brennan et al , 1987; Kameyama , 1986; Strube and Hahn , 1996; Walker et al ,  1998) , but few have attempted to extend the model to multiparty discourse  ( cf . Brennan , 1998; Walker , 1998) . 
For dialog systems , the benefits of using centering theory include improved reference resolution and generation of more coherent referring expressions  . However , it is not at all clear how to adapt the theory for multiparty discourse  . This paper examines some of the issues involved in adapting the theory  , then describes the results of applying three alternative models to a corpus of  2-person dialogs . 
We chose very naive approximations to the original theory as a starting point  . These results will be a baseline for evaluating more sophisticated models in the future  . 
2 The Centering model
The centering framework ( Grosz et al ,  1995 ) makes three main claims : 1 ) given an utterance Un , the * The authors would like to thank James Alien  , Marflyn Walker , and the anonymous reviewers for many helpful comments on a preliminary draft of the paper  .

TR#687 ( Byron and Stent ,  1998 ) model predicts which discoursentity will be the focus of Un+l  ;  2 ) when local focus is maintained between utterances  , the model predicts that it will be expressed with a pronoun  ; and 3) when a pronoun is encountered , the model provides a preference ordering on possible antecedents from the prior utterance  . 
These data structures are created for each \[ In :   2   1  . A partially-ordered list of forward-looking centers C fn that includes all discours entities in utterancen  . Its first element is the ' preferred center ' , C p n . 
2 . A backward-looking center Cbn , the highestranked element of Cf n- 1 that is in Cf n . 
The framework defines a preference ordering on techniques for effecting a topic change  , ranked according to the inference load each places on the addressee  . The transitions are called ' shift ' , ' retain ' and ' continue ' and differ based on whether 
Cbn = Cbn + l and whether Cbn = Cpn.
At the heart of the theory are two centering rules : Rule  1: If any member of Cf n is realized by a pronoun in C f n + l  , Cbn+l must be a pronoun . 
Rule 2: Sequences of continues are preferred over sequences of retains  , and sequences of retains are preferred over sequences of shifts  . 
3 Centering and multiparty discourse
A variety of issues must be addressed to adapt centering to two party dialog  . They include : 1 . Utterance boundaries are difficult to pin down in spoken dialog  , and their determination affects the C f lists . Just how the speaker turns are broken into utterances has a huge impact on the success of the model  ( Brennan ,  1998) . 
2 . Should the dialog participants , referred to via first - and second-person pronouns  ( I/2 PPs )  , be considered ' discours entities ' and included incy ?  2We provide only the briefest sketch of the centering framework  . Readers unfamiliar with the model are referred to  ( Grosz et al , 1995) for more details . 
1475 3 . Which utterance should be considered ' previous ' for locating Cfn-l : the same speaker's previous utterance or the immediately preceding utterance  , regardless of its speaker ? 4 . What should be done with abandoned or partial utterances and those with no discoursentities  . 
4 Experimental method
Our data is from four randomly chosen dialogs in the CALL HOME-English corpus  3   ( LDC ,  1997) . 
Table 1 describes the three models we created to address the issues described in Section  3  . 
Cf elements Use both speakers ' from I/2PPs previous utt to find Cb ? Model 1 Yes No
Model 2 No Yes
Model 3 No No
Table 1: The Centering Models
Issue 1: Utterance boundaries We honored utterance boundaries as transcribed  4  , even if an utterance was a fragment properly belonging at the end of the one preceding  . For instance , the following two utterance seem as though they should be just one: 
Example 1\[dialog 457 11
A ... and she called meone day when
A there was no body in the house but her ...
For compound sentences , we broke each non-subordinate clause into a new utterance  . The utterance break added in Example 2 is indicated by /:
Example 2\[dialog 424 81
A It does make a difference/like I always thought formulas mells kind of disgusting  . 
Issue 2: Selection of items for CfT wo crucial factors in the original model are left to the algorithm implementer : the selection of items for Cf and their rank order ? Both are active areas of research  . In our models , all elements of Cf are created from nouns in the utterance  . We do not include entities referred to by complex nominal constituents such as infinitives  . Associations ( eg . part/subpart ) and ellipsed items are not allowed in determining elements of Cf  . We adopted a commonly used Cfordering : Subj > DO>IO > Other  . Linear sentence position is used to order multiple ' other ' constituents  . Whether discourse participants should be considere discours entities is very perplexing  3The dialog transcripts consisted of 614 utterances , 30 minutes of speech . After annotation ( see issue 1 in section 4) , there were 664 nonempty utterances . 
4CALLHOME transcribers separated utterances at a ~ e aker change or a long pause  , or if the semantics or syntax of language indicated the end of an utterance  . 
from a centering viewpoint ( Byron and Stent ,  1998) . 
One of our models includes entities referred to by  1/2PPs in Cf and two do not . 
Issues 3/4: Previous utterance Empty utterances ( containing no discoursentities ) are skipped in determining Cf ,  . ,_l . Empty utterances include acknowledgements and utterances like " hard to leave behind " with no explicitly mentioned objects  . 
The dialogs were annotated for discourse structure  , so Un-1 is the previous utterance in the discourse segment  , not necessarily linear order . 5 In model 2 , the highestranked element of Cf from either the current speaker's prior utterance or the other speaker's previous utterance is  Cb6  ; models l&3 consider only the immediately preceding utterance . 
We also annotated the ' real ' topic of each utterance  , selected according to the annotator's intuition of what the utterance is ' about '  . It must be explicitly referred to in the utterance and can be an entity referred to using a  I/2PP  . 
After the three models were defined , one dialog was used to train the annotators ( the authors )  7 , then the other three were independently annotated according to the rules outlined above  . The annotators compared their results and agreed upon are conciled version of the data  , which was used to produce the results reported in Section  5  . Annotator accuracy as measured agains the reconcile data over all categories ranged from  80% to 89%  . Accuracy was calculated by counting the number of utterances that differed from the reconciled at a  ( including different ordering of Cf )  , divided by total utterances .   8   5 Results and analysis Table 2 summarizes our findings . Only 10 of 664 utterances violate Centering Rule 1  , so centering the-ory's assumptions linking local focus to pronouns appear to hold in dialog  . It is interesting to note that Model 1 , which includes dialog participants as discourse entities  , consistently performed best in the categories used for this evaluation  . 95 The authors performed segmentation together ; the purpose of this study is to exam in extensions of centering theory  , not discourse segmentation . 
6In case of conflict , recency takes precedence.
7 Annotators must not confer during annotation , so a training dialog is used to clarify unclear annotation instructions  . In this case , the annotators examined it to agree on which syntactic constituents would contribute Cf elements and the criteria for breaking turns into utterances  . 
SMore standard reliability measures could not be used since there are no " tags " in this annotation scheme  , and within some categories there may be an ordered list of items  .

Some empty Cb's result from abrupt topic shifts , while others occur when the speakers make topically related  , but Cf-disjoint , contributions , uc has the last line in :

In many cases , a Cb would exist if we modified the models to include associated and ellipsed entities in Cf  . For instance , in Example 4 , the ellipsed location in A's utterance should be the Cb :  , Example 4\[dialog 4248 1B . . . Ive been the rewalt , yes three times I think
A Well this is our second time 5 . 2 Cb Matches the ' real ' topic For utterances where a Cb can be selected  , it matches the ' real ' topic only 21% to 35% of the time . By this measure , our models are poor predictors of local focus . For instance , in Example 5 , the ' real ' topic of the first utterance is Jackson  , but according to Modell the set of entities referred to by " we " is the Cb of both utterances  . 
Example 5\[dialog 424 81
A And like we went into Jackson , the town and/we were like-AAAHHHI let me out of here The annotators ' intuitions regarding the ' real'topic often conflicted  . It would be interesting to annotate actor and discourse focus separately  , then see which one the Cb most closely matches . 
5.3 Cheap versus expensive transitions
Strube and Hahn ( 1996 ) propose a method of evaluating a model against centering rule  2  , measuring the ' cost ' of the listener's inference load  . A cheap transition has Cbn = Cp , -I , otherwise it is expensive . Models with a large percent of cheap transi-1?57% of Cb's in Model lare entities referred to via I/2PPs  . 
tions better eflect human notions of coherence . All three of our models produced a very low percent of cheap transitions in this experiment  , especially when compared to Strube and Hahn's result of  80%  . 
6 Conclusions and Future work
We conclude that centering behavior in dialog is consistent with that found in monolog  . However , the utility of our preliminary models is questionable  . By revising our Model 1 , we believe a useful model of centering in dialog can be built  . 
This study indicates many promising directions for future research  . Some we intend to pursue are : ? Evaluate the models using other criteria  , e . g . 
improved pronoun resolution.
? Experiment with alternate C for derings and improve the semantic theory to include entities referred to by personal pronouns  , associations and ellipsed entities in Cf . 
? Modify utterance boundaries to reattach interrupted utterances or use Kameyama's proposal for ' center update units '  ( 1998 )  .
