We present a prototype natural language problem -solving application for a financial services call center  , developed as part of the
Amiti?s multilingual humancomputer dialogue project  . Our automated dialogue system , based on empirical evidence from real call-center conversations  , features a datadriven approach that allows for mixed system/customer initiative and spontaneous conversation  . Preliminary evaluation results indicate efficient dialogues and high user satisfaction  , with performance comparable to or better than that of current conversational travel information systems  . 
1 Introduction
Recently there has been a great deal of interest in improving natural language human computer conversation  . Automatic speech recognition continues to improve  , and dialogue management techniques have progressed beyond menu-driven prompts and restricted customer responses  . Yet few researchers have made use of a large body of human-human telephone calls  , on which to form the basis of a datadriven automated system  . 
The Amiti?s project seeks to develop novel technologies for building empirically induced dialogue processors to support multilingual humancomputer interaction  , and to integrate these technologies into systems for accessing information and services  ( http://www . dcs . shef . ac . 
uk/nlp/amities ) . Sponsored jointly by the European Commission and the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency  , the Amiti?s Consortium includes partners in both the EU and the US  , as well as financial call centers in the UK and France  . 
A large corpus of recorded , transcribed telephone conversations between real agents and customers gives us a unique opportunity to analyze and incorporate features of human-human dialogues into our automated system  .   ( Generic names and numbers were substituted for all personal details in the transcriptions  . ) This corpus spans two different application areas : software support and  ( a much smaller size ) customer banking . The banking corpus of several hundred calls has been collected first and it forms the basis of our initial multilingual triaging application  , implemented for English , French and German ( Hardy et al , 2003a ) ; as well as our prototype automatic financial services system  , presented in this paper , which completes a variety of tasks in English . The much larger software support corpus (10 , 000 calls in English and French ) is still being collected and processed and will be used to develop the next Amiti?s prototype  . 
We observe that for interactions with structured data ? whether these data consist of flight information  , spare parts , or customer account information ? domain knowledge need not be built ahead of time  . Rather , methods for handling the data can arise from the way the data are organized  . 
Once we know the basic data structures , the transactions , and the protocol to be followed ( e . g . , establish caller?s identity before exchanging sensitive information  )  ; we need only build build dialogue models for handling various conversational situations  , in order to implement a dialogue system . For our corpus , we have used a modified DAMSL tagset ( Allen and Core ,  1997 ) to capture the functional layer of the dialogues , and a frame-based semantic scheme to record the semantic layer  ( Hardy et al , 2003b ) . The ? frames ? or transactions in our domain are common customer-service tasks : Verify Id  , Change Address , Inquire Balance , Lost/Stolen Card and Make Payment .   ( In this context ? task ? and ? transaction ? are synonymous  . ) Each frame is associated with attributes or slots that must be filled with values in no particular order during the course of the dialogue  ; for example , account number , name , payment amount , etc . 
2 Related Work
Relevant humancomputer dialogue research efforts include the TRAINS project and the 
DARPA Communicator program.
The classic TRAINS natural language dialogue project  ( Allen et al ,  1995 ) is a plan-based system which requires a detailed model of the domain and therefore cannot be used for a wide-ranging application such as financial services  . 
The USDARPA Communicator program has been instrumental in bringing about practical implementations of spoken dialogue systems  . 
Systems developed under this program include CMU?s script-based dialogue manager  , in which the travelitinerary is a hierarchical composition of frames  ( Xu and Rudnicky ,  2000) . The AT&T mixed-initiative system uses a sequential decision process model  , based on concepts of dialog state and dialog actions  ( Levin et al ,  2000) . MIT?s Mercury flight reservation system uses a dialogue control strategy based on a set of ordered rules as a mechanism to manage complex interactions  ( Seneff and Polifroni ,  2000) . CU?s dialogue manager is event-driven , using a set of hierarchical forms with prompts associated with fields in the forms  . Decisions are based not on scripts but on current context  ( Ward and Pellom ,  1999) . 
Our datadriven strategy is similar in spirit to that of CU  . We take a statistical approach , in which a large body of transcribed , annotated conversations forms the basis for task identification  , dialogueact recognition , and form filling for task completion . 
3 System Architecture and Components
The Amiti?s system uses the Galaxy
Communicator Software Infrastructure ( Seneff et al . , 1998) . Galaxy is a distributed , message-based , hub-and-spoke infrastructure , optimized for spoken dialogue systems . 

Figure 1. Amiti?s System Architecture
Components in the Amiti?s system ( Figure 1 ) include a telephony server , automatic speech recognizer , natural language understanding unit , dialogue manager , database interface server , response generator , and text-to-speech conversion . 
3.1 Audio Components
Audio components for the Amiti?s system are provided by LIMSI  . Because acoustic models have not yet been trained  , the current demonstrator system uses a Nuance ASR engine and TTS 

To enhance ASR performance , we integrated static GSL ( Grammar Specification Language ) grammar classes provided by Nuance for recognizing several high-frequency items : numbers  , dates , money amounts , names and yes no statements . 
Training data for the recognizer were collected both from our corpus of human-human dialogues and from dialogues gathered using a textbased version of the human computer system  . Using this version we collected around 100 dialogues and annotated important domain-specific information  , as in this example : ? Himy name is [ f name ; David ] [ l name ; Oconnor ] and my account number is [ account ; 278 one nine five ] . ? Next we replaced these annotated entities with grammar classes  . We also utilized utterances from the Amiti?s banking corpus  ( Hardy et al ,  2002 ) in which the customer specifies his/her desired task  , as well as utterances which constitute common , domain-independent speech acts such as acceptances  , rejections , and indications of non-understanding . These were also used for training the task identifier and the dialogueact classifier  ( Section 3 . 3 . 2) . The training corpus for the recognizer consists of  1744 utterances totaling around 10  , 000 words . 
Using tools supplied by Nuance for building recognition packages  , we created two speech recognition components : a British model in the UK and an American model at two US sites  . 
For the text to speech synthesizer we used Nuance ?s Vocalizer  3  . 0, which supports multiple languages and accents . We integrated the Vocalizer and the ASR using Nuance?s speech and telephony API into a Galaxy -compliant server accessible over a telephone line  . 
3.2 Natural Language Understanding
The goal of the language understanding component is to take the word string output of the ASR module  , and identify key semantic concepts relating to the target domain  . This is a specialized kind of information extraction application  , and as such , we have adapted existing IE technology to this task  . 




Manager Database

Nat?l Language









We have used a modified version of the ANNIE engine  ( A Nearly-New IE system ; Cunningham et al . , 2002; Maynard , 2003) . ANNIE is distributed as the default builtin IE component of the GATE framework  ( Cunningham et al ,  2002) . GATE is a pure Java-based architecture deloped over the past eight years in the University of Sheffield Natural Language Processing group  . ANNIE has been used for many language processing applications  , in a number of languages both European and non -European  . This versatility makes it an attractive proposition for use in a multilingual speech processing project  . 
ANNIE includes customizable components necessary to complete the IE task ? tokenizer  , gazetteer , sentence splitter , part of speech tagger and a named entity recognizer based on a powerful engine named JAPE  ( Java Annotation Pattern
Engine ; Cunningham et al , 2000).
Given an utterance from the user , the NLU unit produces both a list of tokens for detecting dialogue acts  , an important research goal inside this project , and a frame with the possible named entities specified by our application  . We are interested particularly in account numbers  , credit card numbers , person names , dates , amounts of money , locations , addresses and telephone numbers . 
In order to recognize these , we have updated the gazetteer , which works by explicit lookup tables of potential candidates  , and modified the rules of the transducer engine , which attempts to match new instances of named entities based on local grammatical context  . There are some significant differences between the kind of prose text more typically associated with information extraction  , and the kind of text we are expecting to encounter  . 
Current models of IE rely heavily on punctuation as well ascertain orthographic information  , such as capitalized words indicating the presence of a name  , company or location . We have access to neither of these in the output of the ASR engine  , and so had to retune our processors to data which reflected that  . 
In addition , we created new processing resources , such as those required to spot number units and translate them into textual representations of numerical values  ; for example , to take ? twenty thousand one hundred and fourteen pounds ?  , and produce ? ? 20 , 114? . The ability to do this is of course vital for the performance of the system  . 
If none of the main entities can be identified from the token string  , we create a list of possible fallback entities , in the hope that partial matching would help narrow the search space  . 
For instance , if a six-digit account number is not identified , then the incomplete number recognized in the utterance is used as a fallback entity and sent to the database server for partial matching  . 
Our robust IE techniques have proved invaluable to the efficiency and spontaneity of our datadriven dialogue system  . In a single utterance the user is free to supply several values for attributes  , prompted or unprompted , allowing tasks to be completed with fewer dialogue turns  . 
3.3 Dialogue Manager
The dialogue manager identifies the goals of the conversation and performs interactions to achieve those goals  . Several ? Frame Agents ? , implemented within the dialogue manager , handle tasks such as verifying the customer?s identity  , identifying the customer?s desired transaction , and executing those transactions . These range from a simple balance inquiry to the more complex change of address and debit-card payment  . The structure of the dialogue manager is illustrated in Figure  2  . 
Rather than depending on a script for the progression of the dialogue  , the dialogue manager takes a datadriven approach , allowing the caller to take the initiative . Completing a task depends on identifying that task and filling values in frames  , but this may be done in a variety of ways : one at a time  , or several at once , and in any order . 
For example , if the customer identifies himsel for herself before stating the transaction  , or even if he or she provides several pieces of information in one utterance ? transaction  , name , account number , payment amount ? the dialogue manager is flexible enough to move a head after these variations  . 
Prompts for attributes , if needed , are not restricted to one at a time , but they are usually combined in the way human agents request them  ; for example , city and county , expiration date and issue number , birth date and telephone number .

If the system fails to obtain the necessary values from the user  , reprompts are used , but no more than once for any single attribute . For the customer verification task , different attributes may be Response Decision

I?ms or ry , we have not been able to obtain the information necessary to update your address in our records  . Please hold while I transfer you to a customer service representative  . ? 3 . 3 . 1 Task ID Frame Agent For task identification , the Amiti?s team has made use of the data collected in over  500 conversations from a British call center , recorded , transcribed , and annotated . Adapting a vector-based approach reported by Chu -Carroll and Carpenter  ( 1999 )  , the Task IDFrame Agent is domain-independent and automatically trained  . 
Tasks are represented as vectors of terms , built from the utterances requesting them . Some examples of labeled utterances are : ? ErmI ' d like to cancel the account cover premium that's on my  , appeared on my statement ? [ Cancel Insurance] and ? Erm just to report a lost card please ? [ Lost/Stolen Card]  . 
The training process proceeds as follows : 1 . Begin with corpus of transcribed , annotated calls . 
2 . Document creation : For each transaction , collect raw text of callers ? queries . Yield : one ? document ? for each transaction ( about 14 of these in our corpus )  . 
3 . Text processing : Remove stop words , stem content words , weight terms by frequency . 
Yield : one ? document vector ? for each task.
4 . Compare queries and documents : Create ? query vectors  . ? Obtain a cosine similarity score for each query /document pair  . Yield : cosine scores/routing values for each query/document pair  . 
5 . Obtain coefficients for scoring : Use binary logistic regression  . Yield : a set of coefficients for each task . 
Next , the Task ID Frame Agent is tested on unseen utterances or queries :  1  . Begin with one or more user queries . 
2 . Text processing : Remove stop words , stem content words , weight terms ( constant weights ) . 
Yield : ? query vectors ?.
3. Compare each query with each document.
Yield : cosine similarity scores.
4 . Compute confidence scores ( use training coefficients )  . Yield : confidence scores , representing the system?s confidence that the queries indicate the user?s choice of a particular transaction  . 
Tests performed over the entire corpus ,   80% of which was used for training and 20% for testing , resulted in a classification accuracy rate of 85%   ( correct task is one of the system?s top 2 choices )  . 
The accuracy raterises to 93% when we eliminate confusing or lengthy utterances  , such as requests for information about payments , statements , and general questions about a customer?s account . 
These can be difficult even for human annotators to classify  . 
3.3.2 Dialogue Act Classifier
The purpose of the DA Classifier Frame Agent is to identify a caller?s utterance as one or more domain-independent dialogue acts  . These include Accept , Reject , Non-understanding , Opening , Closing , Backchannel , and Expression . Clearly , it is useful for a dialogue system to be able to identify accurately the various ways a person may say ? yes ?  , ? no ? , or ? what did you say ?? As with the task identifier  , we have trained the DA classifier on our corpus of transcribed  , labeled human-human calls , and we have used vector-based classification techniques  . Two differences from the task identifier are 1 ) an utterance may have multiple correct classifications  , and 2) a different stoplist is necessary . Here we can filter out the usual stops , including speech dysfluencies , proper names , number words , and words with digits ; but we need to include words such as yeah , uh huh , hi , ok , thanks , pard on and sorry . 
Some examples of DA classification results are shown in Figure  3  . For sure , ok , the classifier returns the categories Backchannel  , Expression and Accept . If the dialogue manager is looking for either Acceptor Reject  , it can ignore Backchannel and Expression in order to detect the correct classification  . In the case of certainly not , the first word has a strong tendency toward Accept  , though both together constitute a Reject act . 

Text : ? sure , okay ? Text : ? certainly not ?

Figure 3. DA Classification examples
Our classifier performs well if the utterance is short and falls into one of the selected categories  ( 86% accuracy on the British data )  ; and it has the advantages of automatic training , domain independence , and the ability to capture a great variety of expressions  . However , it can be inaccurate when applied to longer utterances  , and it is not yet equipped to handle domain -specific assertions  , questions , or queries about a transaction . 
3.4 Database Manager
Our system identifies users by matching information provided by the caller against a database of user information  . It assumes that the speech recognizer will make errors when the caller attempts to identify himself  . Therefore perfect matches with the database entries will be rare  . 
Consequently , for each record in the database , we attach a measure of the probability that the record is the target record  . Initially , these measures are estimates of the probability that this individual will call  . When additional identifying information arrives , the system updates these probabilities using Bayes ? rule  . 
Thus , the system might begin with a uniform probability estimate across all database records  . If the user identifies herself with a name recognized by the machine as ? Smith ?  , the system will appropriately increment the probabilities of all entries with the name ? Smith ? and all entries that are known to be confused with ? Smith ? in proportion to their observed rate of substitution  . Of course , all records not observed to be so confusable would similarly have their probabilities decreased by Bayes ? rule  . When enough information has come into raise the probability for some record above a threshold  ( in our system 0 . 99 probability) , the system assumes that the caller has been correctly identified  . The designer may choose to include a verification dialog  , but our decision was to minimize such interactions to shorten the calls  . 
Our error-correcting database system receives tokens with an identification of what field each token should represent  . The system processes the tokens serially . Each represents an observation made by the speech recognizer  . To process a token , the system examines each record in the database and updates the probability that the record is the target record using Bayes ? rule : where rec is the event where the record under consideration is the target record  . 
As is common in Bayes ? rule calculations , the denominator P ( obs ) is treated as a scaling factor , and is not calculated explicitly . All probabilities are renormalized at the end of the update of all of the records  . P ( rec ) is the previous estimate of the probability that the record is the target record  . 
P ( obsrec ) is the probability that the recognizer returned the observation that it did given that the target record is the current record under examination  . For some of the fields , such as the account number and telephone number , the user responses consist of digits . We collected data on the probability that the speech recognition system we are using mistook one digit for another and calculated the values for P  ( obsrec ) from the data . 
For fields involving place names and personal names  , the probabilities were estimated . 
Once a record has been selected ( by virtue of its probability being greater than the threshold  ) the system compares the individual fields of the record with values obtained by the speech recognizer  . If the values differ greatly , as measured by their Levenshtein distance , the system returns the field name to the dialogue manager as a candidate for additional verification  . If no record meets the threshold probability criterion  , the system returns the most probable record to the dialogue manager  , along with the fields which have the greatest Levenshtein distance between the recognized and actual values  , as candidates for reprompting . 
Our database contains 100 entries for the system tests described in this paper  . We describe the system in a more demanding environment with one million records in Inouye et al  ( 2004 )  . In that project , we required all information to be entered by spelling the items out so that the vocabulary was limited to the alphabet plus the ten digits  . In the current project , with fewer names to deal with , we allowed the complete vocabulary of the domain : names  , streets , counties , and so forth . 
3.5 Response Generator
Our current English-only system preserves the language-independent features of our original trilingual generator  , storing all language - and domain-specific information in separate text files  . 
It is a template-based system , easily modified and extended . The generator constructs utterances according to the dialogue manager?s specification of one or more speech acts  ( prompt , request , confirm , respond , inform , backchannel , accept , reject ) , repetition numbers , and optional lists of attributes , values , and/or the person?s name . As far as possible , we modeled utterances after the human-human dialogues  . 
For a more natural-sounding system , we collected variations of the utterances , which the generator selects at random . Requests , for example , may take one of twelve possible forms :
Request , part 1 of 2:
Can you just confirm Can I have CanI take
What is What?s May I have ) (  ) ( ) ( ) ( obsP recPrecobsPobsrecP ?=
Request , part 2 of 2: [ list of attributes] , [ person name ]? [ list of attributes] , please ? Offers to close or continue the dialogue are similarly varied : 
Closing offer , part 1 of 2:
Is there anything else Anything else Is there anything else at all 
Closing offer , part 2 of 2:
I can do for you today ? I can help you with today ? I cando for you ? I can help you with ? you need today ? you need ?  4 Preliminary Evaluation Tennative speakers of English  , 6 female and 4 male , were asked to participate in a preliminary in-lab system evaluation  ( half in the UK and half in the US )  . The Amiti?s system developers were not among these volunteers  . Each made 9 phone calls to the system from behind a closed door  , according to scenarios designed to test various customer identities as well as single or multiple tasks  . After each call , participants filled out a questionnaire to register their degree of satisfaction with aspects of the interaction  . 
Overall call success was 70% , with 98% successful completions for the Verify Id and 96% for the Check Balance subtasks ( Figure 4 )  . 
? Failures ? were not system crashes but simulated transfers to a human agent  . There were 5 user terminations . 
Average word error rates were 17% for calls that were successfully completed , and 22% for failed calls . Word error rate by user ranged from 11% to 26% .

Figure 4. Task Completion Rates
Call duration was found to reflect the complexity of each scenario  , where complexity is defined as the number of ? concepts ? needed to complete each task  . The following items are judged to be concepts : task identification  ; values such as first name , last name , house number , street and phone number ; and positive or negative responses such as whether a new card is desired  . 
Figures 5 and 6 illustrate the relationship between length of call and task complexity  . It should be noted that customer verification , a task performed in every dialogue , requires a minimum of 3 personal details to be verified against a database record  , but may require more in the case of recognition errors  . 
The overall average number of turns per dialogue was  18  . 28 . The user spoke an average of 6 . 89 words per turn and the system 11 . 42 . 
User satisfaction for each call was assessed by way of a questionnaire containing five statements  . 
These covered the clarity of the instructions , ease of doing the task , how well the system understands the caller , how well the system works , and the caller?s enjoyment of the system . Participants rated each on a five-point Likert scale  . Summed results showed an average score of 20 . 45 overall users ( range 5?25 ; higher=stronger agreement ) .

Scenario Complexity ( top ) and Average Call Duration by Scenario ( in seconds ) Although user satisfaction was high , we were more interested in identifying the major problems for the callers  . Users were often frustrated by recognition failures and/or unsuccessful attempts to capture values such as a news treet address  , county , or phone number . Sometimes the system failed to determine that the user was finished  . 
Because the system is designed to be nonrestrictive in accepting users ? input  , misidentifications were common . One user spoke for many by saying , ? There were times when the system would ask me to repeat information I had not yet given to it  . ? We plan to revise our strategy so that we area little more cautious in our reprompts  . Occasionally , the system misidentified the user?s desired task and haddifficulty backing off gracefully and starting the correct task  . We are working on improving our recovery strategies for these cases  . 
The following transcription of an interaction with our system illustrates the efficiency made possible when the data supplied by the caller drives the conversation : AMITI?S : Hello  , this is Am-ih-tee-eh ! What can
Ido for you ?
USER : yesthisis Stella Lang . Mycard number is three one six seven one four . Can you tell me the balance on my account please ? AMITI?S : Can you just confirm the city and county ? 
USER : uh yesit?s London , Middlesex
AMITI?S : I?ms orry , I didn?t understand what you said . Can you repeat , please ?
USER : London , Middlesex
AMITI?S : All right , your balance is 1753 pounds and 20 pence . Anything else I cando for you ? USER : yesI'd like to make a payment of fifty three pounds with my debit card please AMITI?S : CanI have the debit card number  , 
Miss Lang ?
USER : sure , it's two eights even four six six four nine five eight nine five three eight nine one  , and it expires October two thousand six AMITI?S : What's the issue number  , please ?
USER : one
AMITI?S : Ok , Miss Lang , I'llsend in the payment amount of 53 pounds . Did I get that right ? USER : yes , what's my new balance please ? AMITI?S : Ok , that's gone through . Your payment will be credited overnight and will reflect on your next statement  . Yourbalance is 1700 pounds and 20 pence . Anything else I can do for you today ?
USER : no , that's it thanks
AMITI?S : Thanks very much for your call , good by e . 
USER : bye 5 Discussion , Future Work
The preliminary evaluation reported here indicates promise for an automated dialogue system such as ours  , which incorporates robust techniques for information extraction  , record matching , task identification , dialogue act classification , and an overall datadriven strategy . 
Task duration and number of turns per dialogue both appear to indicate greater efficiency and corresponding user satisfaction than many other similar systems  . In the DARPA Communicator evaluation , for example , between 60 and 79 calls were made to each of 8 participating sites ( Walker , et al ,  2001 ,  2002) . A sample scenario for a domestic roundtrip flight contained  8 concepts ( airline , departure city , state , date , etc . ) . The average duration for such a call was over 300 seconds ; whereas our overall average was 104 seconds . ASR accuracy rates in 2001 were about 60% and 75% , for airline it ineraries not completed and completed  ; and task completion rates were 56% . Our average number of user words per turn , 6 . 89 , is also higher than that reported for Communicator systems  . This number seems to reflect lengthier responses to open prompts  , responses to system requests for multiple attributes  , and greater user initiative . 
We plan to port the system to a new domain : from telephone banking to information-technology support  . As part of this effort we are again collecting data from real human-human calls  . For advanced speech recognition , we hope to train our ASR on new acoustic data . We also plan to expand our dialogue act classification so that the system can recognize more types of acts  , and to improve our classification reliability .
