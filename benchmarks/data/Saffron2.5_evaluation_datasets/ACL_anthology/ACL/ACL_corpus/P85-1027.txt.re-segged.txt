ABSTRACTINTRODUCTION
Anaphora resolution is the process of
determining the referent of ~ uaphors.
such as definite noun phrases and
pronouns , in a discourse . Computational linguists , in modeling the process of anaphora resolution , have proposed the notion of focusing . Focusing is the process , engaged in by a reader , of selecting a subset of the discourse items and maJ ? ing them highly available for further computations  . This paper provides a cognitive basis for anaphora resolution and focusing  . Human memory is divided into a short term , an operating , and a longterm memory . 
Short-term memory can only contain a small number of meaning units and its retrieval time is fast  . Short-term memory is divided into a cache and a buffer  . The cache contains a subset of meaning units expressed in the previous sentences and the buffer holds a representation of ~ he incoming sentence  . 
Focusing is realized in ~ he cache that contains a subset of the most topical units and a subset of the mos ~ recent units in the text  . The information stored in the cache is used to integrate ~ he incoming sentence with the preceding discourse  . Pronouns should be used to refer to units in focus  . Operating memory contains a very large number of units but its re~rleval time is slow  . 
It contains the previous tex~units that are not in the cache  . It comprises the tex ~ units not in focus . Definite noun phrases should be used to refer to unite not in focus  . Two empirical studies are described that demonstrate the cognitive basis for focusing  , the use of definite noun phrases to refer to antecedents not in focus  , and the use of pronouns to refer to antecedents in focus  . 
The goal of thls research is to show the relation between the psychological work on anaphor are so lution based on the notion of a limited shortterm or working memory and the computat ional linguistics work based on the notion of focusing  . 
This rapprochement is important for the following reasons : 
I ) From a theoretical viewpoint.
cognitive evidence increases the validity of the computational notion of focus  . 
2 ) Focusing corresponds to one of the reader's comprehension processes and it needs to be incorporated in the model of the user in language understanding systems to adequately resolve am ~ i guitles in the user's utterances and to handle language generation  . 
FOCUSING IN COMPUTATION ALLING UISTICS
According to Grosz (1977) . who was interested in ~ he resolution of defin ite noun phrases  , focusing is the process . 
engaged in by participants in a discourse , of highlighting a subset of their shared reality  . Grosz . Joshi . and we instein ( 1983 ) distinguish between two levels of focus , global focus and centerimg . Global focusing is a major factor in maintaining global coherence and in the interpretation of definite noun phrases  . Centering is a major factor in maintaining local coherence and in the interpretation of pronouns  . 
Grosz . Joshi . and Weinstein further define the notion of centering  . Each sentence has two types of centers whose purpose is to integrate the sentence to the discourse  . The backward-looking center links the current sentence to the preceding discourse  . The set of forward-looklng centers provides th ~set of entities to which further anaphors m~y refer  . The b6ok w~rd-looklng center corresponds , roughly . -to Sidner's focus and the forward-looklng centers to 
Sidner's potent la~l fool.

One principle derived by Grosz,
Joshl , and Weins ~ ein is the following : if the b~okward -looking center of the our ren~utterance is the same as the baokward-looklng cen~er of the previous utterance  , a pronoun should be used . In other words , if there are no ~ oplc shifts , continue to refer to the same entity by using a pronoun  . 
However , violations of-this principle have been presented in Grosz  ( 1977 ) and noted in Grosz , Joshl , and Welns~eln (198~) . They have shown that pronouns are sometimes used to refer to entities mentioned many sentences back  , even though the backward-looklng center of intervening sentences has been changed by topic shifts  . 
Sidner (19 V 9 .  1983 ) has proposed the notion of focus in the context of interpreting anaphors  , especially pronouns . In Sidner's theory , an anaphor neither refers ~ o another word nor corefers to another word  . but rather co-specifies a cognitive elemen ~ in the reader's mind  . Moreover . a theory of an & phora resolution must predict the pattern of reader's correct and incorrect choices of co-specifiers and ~ he failures ~ ounders t and  . This view makes explicit the consideration of the reader's mental model and inferential capa ~bili~ies 
As Eetch of Sidner's focusing process follows . First . an initial focus is selected on the basis of syntactic features and thematic roles indicating top lc ~ lity in the flrs ~ sentence  . Other elements introduced in the sentence are stored as potential loci for later sentences  . When an anaphor l c expression is encountered . 
this focus is tested as a co-specl fler for ~ he anaphor  . It has to satisfy syntaotlores ~ r lo ~ ions on coreferences  ( L~snlk ,  1976) , semantics eleo ` ional restrlo ~ ions ( Katz and Fodor ,  1963) , and pragmatic plausibility oons ~ raln~s expressed in the remainder of the sentence  . If the focus fails ~ saco-specl fier for the ~ n ~ phor  , the potential fool are tried in turn . At the same time , the new elements introduced in the sentence are stored as potential loci for later sentences  . 
Third , the focus is updated to the selected co-specl f ler for the anaphor  . 
If the focus has changed , a topics ~ if t has occurred . The second and thirds ~ eps are cyclically applied after each sentence  . 
The advantage of using a focus mechanism is tha ~ it priorltlzes and restrlc~s the search for a co-spec lfier  , and as a consequence , reduces the oom put at lon~l costs as soolated with inferential processing when test ln~the appl icability of the oo-specl fler to the anaphor  . 
COGNITIVESTUDIES OF ANAPHORARESOLUTION
A few representative empirical studies of anaphora resolution are described below  . All the experimental par~dlgms used share the fol lowing assumptions :  1  ) human memory is func ` ionally ors ~ ruc ~ urally divided into at least two types of memories  , a shortterm memory with small storage capacity but very fast retrieval time and a longterm memory with very larges ~ orage capacity but slow retrieval time :  2  ) a topic shift transfers the units currently in short term memory to lon ~- term memory:  3  ) ~nanaphor transfers its referent from longterm memory to short term memory  ( i . e . reinstates its referent ) , if it was not already in shortterm memory . 
The first assumption is crucial.
Other things being equal , computations involving retrieval from shortterm memory will be faster than those involving retr i eval from long term memory  . Turning to the second assumption , topic shifts have been found to be induced wlth a varify of linguls % ic devices  . One of the devices is the introduction of intervening sentences between the referent and its anaphor  . The intervening sentences are unrelated zo the referent but related to the overall text  . Another device is the specification of a temporal or Spatial parameter that is outside the normal range of a situation  . When describing a dinner , the phrase " Five hours later , " signals ~ h~t the topic of conversation is no longer the dinner  . Another device is the use of an anaphor , frequently a deflnlte noun phrase , to refer to an antecedent tha ~ is not currently the topic of conversation bu ~ is in the " background "  . Finally , there is the use of keyphrases to signal a diversion in the flow of discourse  , such as " Let's turn to . " . as documented in Relchman (1978, 1984) . 
The general pattern for the material used in these experiments is the following  . A ~ the beginning of the tex ~ appears a sentence containing a referent  ( e . g . biologist ) . For example , " The mission included a biologist " . Then , if ~ he referent should not be in focus , the nex~sentence or sentences in dloate a topic shift as described  aJ3ovs   ( e . g . 
~9 unrelated intervening sentences ) . If the referent should be in focus , no devices for topic shifts are used . The following sentence then contains an an & phor ( e . g . scientist , he ) to the focused or non-focused referent ( e . g . 
biologist ) . For example , " The scientlst collected samples from the cultures "  . 
Another example is shown in Table 1 of this paper.
Carpenter and Just ( 1977 ) used eyetraoklng with other converging techniques to study anaphora resolution  . 
Wl theye tracking , one can monitor very precisely the trajectory of the eyes  , with their forward and regressive movements , and the duration of eyefixations on small segments of the te ~  . 
The assumption behind using this technique is that eye movements are closely related to higher level cognitive activities such as comprehension  . Therefore . one can expect longer fixation durations on text segments requiring additional processing to be comprehended and one can expect the eye movement pattern to mirror the selective pick up of important information in the text  . 
They performed a series of experiments test ln ~ the effect of recency of a referent on the time course of anaphora resolution  . Indirectly . 
they tested the effect of recency on the availabi lity of an item in shortterm memory  . They presented texts where the number of sentences between the referent and the anaphor was varied from zero to three  . The subjects read each sentence and . after the sentence , had to decide whether it was consistent or inconsistent with the previous sentences  . The consistency Judgment times and the eye fixations were recorded  . The consistency Judgment task , used as converging evidence with the eye movement technique  , is believed to induce the subjects to integrate each new sentence and should pars  , llel the difficulty of ~ phora resolution . The overall reading time of the ~ n & phorlo sentence was measured using the eyetracking technique  . Each of these tasks should be faster if the referent was in shortterm memory than if the referent was in longterm memory  . 
Response times for the consistency
Judgments and reading times of the anaphor lc sentences increased as then-mher of intervening sentences increased  . The sharpest difference appeared between zero and one intervening sentence  . Gaze durations within the anaphor lo sentence were shorter when there were no intervenlng sentences th ~ n in the other conditions  . 
These results show not only that & naphora resolut ion is easier when the referent is nearer the ~ naphor but also that one interven lnE sentence may be sufflolent to produce a topic shift  . 
Clare and Sengul ( 1979 ) used the sentence reading time technique to study anaphora resolution  . In this technique . 
subjects control the onset and offset of the presentation of a sentence by pressing a button  . The subjects are instructed to press the button to see a new sentence as soon as they have understood the current sentence  . The assumption behind this technique is that additional processing required for comprehension will increase sentence reading time  . 
Clare and Sengul ( 1979 ) measured the reading time of a sentence containing an anaphor  . They distinguished between two models of the effect of recency of a referent on the speed of ~ naphora resolution  . In the first model , called the " continuity model " , entities mentioned in the discourse are searched backward from the last one  . One should expect monotonically increasing re ~ din ~ time as the searched entity is farther back  . In the second model , called the " discontinuity model " , entities mentioned in the current or last sentence are kept in shortterm memory and accessed first  . All the entities that are further back are more likely to be in longterm memory  ( and not in shor ~- term memory ) and accessed second . 
Subjects rea ~ short paragraphs where a referent could be separated from the anaphor by zero ~ o two interven in ~ sentences  . The readln~time of ~ he sentence containing the anaphor was fast when the referent was in the immediately preceding sentence but ~ all x ~ when it was two or three sentences before  . 
This finding supports the discontinuity model . Entities in the last processing cycle are more l ikely to be kept in short term memory than ent it ies in previously processed cycles  . Once atex ~ entity is not in short term , the number of intervening sentences does not affect the speed of an ~ phora resolution  . 
Les gold , Roth , and Curtis (1979) , who related the linguistic notion of for egrounding  ( Chafe ,  1972 ) to ~ hepsychological notion of shortterm memory , performed a series of experiments similar ~ o those of Clark ~ nd Sengul  ( 1979 )  , using more varied ways to produce topic shifts , and replicated the above findings . 

McKoon and gatoliff ( 1980 ) used an activation procedure based on Chang ( 1980 )  . A desoriptlon of the baslo paradigm and its underlying loglo follows  . When one reads a text , only a small part of the text information is stored in shortterm memory and most of the information is stored in longterm memory  . This is due to the very small storage capacity of short term memory  ( 7t 2 chun Es ; Miller ,  1956) . Given that retrieval time in shortterm memory is much faster than retrieval time in longterm memory  , it will tame longer to remember something from the text if the memory is stored in longterm memory than in shortterm memory  . 
In their study , subjects read a paragraph sentence by sentence . 
Immediately after the last sentence , the subjects were presented with a single word and the subjects had to remember whether the word had appeared previously in the text or not  ( an old-new recognition )  . If the tested word was still in short term memory  , the old-new recognition time should be faster than if it was in longterm memory  . 
To test this hypothesis , the paragraphs were constructed in the following manner  . The referent ( e . g . 
burglar ) was separated from the anaphor by either zero or ~ wo in ~ erven lng sentences  . The anaphor appeared in the last sentence of the paragraph  . The last sentence was presented in one of three versions : i  ) the subject of the sentence was a repetition ( i . e . 
burglar ) of the referent in the first sentence ( anaphorio-identioal )  ; 2) the subject was the name of the category-(e . g . criminal ) in which the referent belonged ( anaphorlc-category )  ; 3) the subject was a noun ( e . g . ca ~) unrelated ~ othe referent ( nonanaphoric ) . During the experimental trials , the " referent " ( i . e . burglar ) was presented immediately after the last sentence for an old-new recognition  . 
Assuming that an anaphor activates its referent by making it available in shortterm memory  , one can expect slgnif loantly faster old-new recognition times for " burglar " in the anaphor lc-ca ~ egoryo on di ~ lonth an in the non -anaphor locondition  . This prediction was observed . 
Surprisingly , the number of intervening sentences did not have an effect  . This suggests that the two intervening sentences did not remove the referent from short term memory  ( i . e . 
" backgrounds " the referent) . It is probably not the case . Rather . i ~ is llkely that by testing the referent at the end of the clause  , as opposed to when the anaphor is encountered , the referent had time to be reinstated in shor ~ -term memory and be highly available  . This is an important point . 
The activation procedure was not on-llne since the old-new recognition ocoured at the ~ n ~ of the sentence as opposed to 
M ~ ll ~ the sentence was read and the anaphor encountered  . 
Another initially surprising effect was that ~ heold-new recognition times for the referents were slower in the zero intervening sentences when the anaphor was a repetition of the referent itself than when the anaphor was the category name  . This last result suggests that it is not appropriate to use a definite noun phrase  , especially a repetition of the referent , to refer to a antecedent in shortterm memory . 
As explained previously , intervening sentences are not the only devices that transfer text units from short term to longterm memory  . 
Stereotypical situations have spatial and temporal parameters with legal ranges of values  . If one specifies a spatial or ~ emporal value outside these ranges  , a scenario-shift occurs . For example . Anderson ( in Sanford and
Garrodo 1981 ) constructed texts about stereotypical situations such as going to a restaurant  . In one sentence of the text , there was a reference to a character related to the script  , say a waiter . AZ the beginning of the next sentence , there was a mention of a temporal or spatial parameter  , such as " One hour later " or " Five hours la ~ er " . 
In the flrs ~ case the parameter is within the range defining the scrip ~  , in the second case it is not . The rest of ~ he sentence contained an anaphor to the previously mentioned character  , the walter . Measumlng ~ here a ding time of the anaphor lo sentence  . Anderson showed longer reading time when the spatial or temporal parameter w~s outside the range of the script th ~ n inside  . This suggests that the referent was transfered from short term to longterm memory by the scenarlo -shlft and it took longer ~ o retrieve the referent during anaphora resolution  . 
The results from all these experiments support the notion tha ~ an anaphor activates its referent by malting it highly available in shortterm memory and ~ hat topic shifts transfer units from short term memory to long term memoz ' y  . However . none of these studles ~ except some eye movement siudles  .

COGNITIVE BASISF ORFO CUSING
A sketch of a cognitive model of anaphora resolut ion is offered here  . It has been heavily influenced by the short -term ~ long-term memory model of 
Kintsch and van DiJk ( 19~8 ) and especially its leading edge strategy . 
~tructure ~ f ~ memg / ~
Analogically , human memory can be conceptualized as a three level structure similar to the memory of most mini and main frame computers  . It consists of a small , very fast memory called shortterm memory ( STM ) ; a relatively larger main or operating memory ( OM ) : and a vast store of general world knowledge cal led long term memory  ( LTM )  . 
The total STM is only large enough to contain 7t2 chunks of information at any one time ( Simon , 1974; Miller . 
1956) . The resources for STM are dynamically allocated to one of two uses  . First , par ~ of the STM is used to store the incoming sentence or clause  . 
This is a temporary storage of the sentence or clause before further processing and is called the STM buffer  . 
The second part of STM is called the STM cache . It is used to hold over . from one sentence or clause to the next . the information necessary to provide local and global coherence  . It contains a subset of the previous text items that are topical and a subset of those that are recent  . Retrieval times from shortterm memory are very fast  . 
Conceptually . operating memory is the subset of the world knowledge in longterm memory which is deemed relev~n ~ to the prooes slng of the current par ~ of the text  . It also contains the growing memory structure oorrs spond in ~ to the tex ~ reads of ~ r  . 
I ~ contains the less topical and less recent information from the text  . 
Retrieval times are much longer than for shortterm memory  . 
The time course of anaphora resolution is greatly determined by the current content of shor ~- term memory and of operating memory  . Moroever , pronouns and definite noun phrases are resolved using differents ~ rategies  . 
Cache ~ . During the input of a sentence into the buffer ~ nd the concurrent integration of the sentence into the cache  , a subset of the semantic units held in the STM is selected to be held over in the cache for the next cycle  . Following Elntsch and van Dijk (1978) , the cache management strategy selects a subset T of the most topical items and a subset R of the most recent items to be held over in the cache  . The selection strategy aims atm~xlmizin ~ the probability that an anaphor in the nex ~ sentence will refer to a semantic unit held in the cache  . Cache management is applied after each sentence or clause  . 
Pronouns and definite noun phrases are resolved using different strategies  , we will describe four cases : i . The anaphor is a definite noun phrase and the referent is not in focus  , that is , i ~ is in operating memory ,  2 . The anaphor is a definite noun phrase and the referent is in focus  , that is . it is in the cache . 
3 . The anaphor is a pronoun and the referent is in the cache  ( infOCUS )  . 
4 . The anaphor is a pronoun and the referent is in operating memory  ( not in focus )  . 
It is hypothesized that the explicitness of sm anaphor is a signal  . 
used by the readier , which denotes whether the referent is in the cache or in operating memory  . 
If the ~ naphor is a definite noun phrase , operating memory is searched immediately . If the referent is in operating memory it is then reinstated into the cache  . A topic shift has occured . 
If the anaphor is a definite noun phrase and the referent is in focus  ( i . e . in the cache ) , anaphora resolution will be hindered . The reader searches operating memory while the referent is in shortterm memory  . 
Correspondingly . this violates a rule of cooperative communication : use a definite noun phrase to refer to an ~ ntecedent not in focus  . The definite noun phrase signals a topic shift , while in fact . the same entity is being talked about . 

If the anaphor is a pronoun , the cache is searched for a plausible referent . If found , mnaphora resolution is completed . Because cache management is based on topioallty and recency  , pronouns can refer to ~ hemain ~ opio of ~ he text even when the main ~ opio has no ~ been mentioned directly for mamy sentences  . Unless there is a global ~ opic shift , the main topic in the cache remains unchanged throughout ~ he text  . 
If the anaphor is a pronoun but no referent is found in the cache  , it is then necessary to search operating memory . If a referen ~ is found in operating memory , it is reinstated into the c~che . A ~ opic shift has occured . 
Using a pronoun ~ o refer ~ o information in operating memory is de ~ rlmental ~ oa maph or a resolution  . The reader first searches the cache . ~ hen~he operating memory , and ~ hen has ~ or elnst ~ te ~ he referent into the cache  . 

A clear relation exists between ~ he notion of focusing proposed in computational linguistics and the model of human memory and discourse processing proposed in cognitive psychology  . 
The Q~h ~ is used to store the items in f . ~ Q  ~ . Given the small number of items stored in the cache  , a sketchy anaphor such as ~~ is sufflclen ~ to retrieve the referent  . The cache management strategy in human . memory is aimed at maximizing ~ he probability that the cache contains the information relevant to the next cycle of computation  . The cache , by containing topical and recen ~ i ~ ems , allows to maintain global and local coherence . 
Q~m~y ~ is used ~ ostore items that are not in f ~ A  ~  . Because the set of items is large , an informative descrlp ~ ion of the Item ~ obe searched for is needed  . D~fi~i ~ ~ ou ~ ~ h / ~ esa/eused ~ oindlc~te to the reader ~ ha ~ thei ~ em is no ~ in focus  . 
thus In operating memory . Other things being equal , it will tame more time to retrieve an item from operating memory than from the cache  . The referent will need to be reinstated into the cache  . 
This will produce a topic shift . There in stated referent is then highly available and can be referred to by using a pronoun  . 
TWOON-LINESTUDIES OF ANAPHORA

The presented studies test the notion tha ~ focus is cognltively realized in the reader'sl imited short-term memory  . They also test Grosz . Joshl . and Welnsteln's claim that definite noun phrases  , and not pronouns , should be used to refer ~ o items no longer in focus and ~ hat pronouns  , ~nd not definite noun phrases , should be used to refer to items in focus . 
Moreover , if one assumes that the content of short term memory is dynamically updated on ~ he basis of recency ~ nd topicality  , one can explain why pronouns can be used to refer Zorecent items ~ nd also to topical non-recen ~ items  . 
A new technique , called Q ~ zli ~ ~ iQn , was developed specifically to provide the empirical da ~ a for these studies  . The on-line activation technique can be compared to " closely " tracing the execution of ~ program  . 
In the on-line activation technique , passages are presented using rapid serial visual presentation  ( RS VP )  , one word a ~ a time . In ~ dditlon to reading each text . the participants were also given the ~ ask to recognize whether some specially marked words  , presented surreptitiously wi~hl n~he ~ ext , had appemred before in the tex ~ or not . 
Some of ~ hesespecial words were presented before in the text and others were not  . . We will call ~ hese special ly marked words zest words  . This task is called a mold-new recognition task . 
The passages contained anaphors referring ~ o antecedents which were either in focus or not in focus  . An antecedent was removed from focus by introducing a topic shift  , with ~ here strlc ~ ion that the antecedent was not the main topic of the discourse  . An example ter ~ is presented in table I . 
Note that only one of the alternative sentences 5a   , 5b . or 50 was presented for each text to the participants of the study  . 
In each text . one of the test words was the referent of the anaphor  . At some point before or after the anaphor was presented on the CRT  , its referent was presented for old-new recognit ion and recognition times and errors were collected  . The delay between the onse ~ of the anaphor and the onset of the test word is called the stimulus on set a synchrony  ( SOA )  . The ~ naphor is acting as a prime , which should activate the referent . The old-new recognition time for the referent test word indicates in operating memory  .

In addition , there were three types of primes , as shown in sentences 5a , 5b , 8 ~ d5o in Tablei . The prime could be either semantically related and referential  ( S + R ? ) ~ in 5a , semantically related and not referential ( S + R- ) as in 5b , or semantically unrelated and not referential ( SR- ) as in 5c . In the S?R ? condition , the prime is the an ~ phor . The two conditions S?R-and SR-were control conditions to separate the effect of semantic priming  , due ~ o semantic ~ ssociation between the anaphor and the referent  , on the old-new reccgnltlon for referents .

The predictions were:
I . If a referent is not in focus , due to a topic shift , theoooure noe of the anaphor should reinstate the referent into the cache  , leading to faster old-new recognition times . In terms of the experimental conditions , there should be a decrease in old-new recognit iontime at the  350 and 1250 msec conditions in the S+R ? condition ( i . e . after the anaphor ) , but not in the S+R-and SR-conditions , which are not anaphorio . 
2 . The use of a definite noun phrase to refer to an antecedent in the cache  ( i . e . 
in focus ) should be detrimental to anaphora resolution . IZ should slow down the recognition of the referent as old or new  . In terms of the ex~erlmental conditions , if the referent is in focus , the old-new recognition times in the 350 and 1250 msec SOA conditions should be slower than in the before SOA coD ~ Litlon  .

They also support the notion that an anaphorre in states a referent not in focus and does so by transferring the r@ferent to the cache  .

An a priori comparison demonstrates that us ing a definite noun phrase ~ o refer to an item in focus hinders anaphora resolution  . What seems ~ o happen is a surprize effect caused by the violation of a linguistic usage relating the form of the anaphor to the fOCUSS ~ atus of its referent  . The recognition time for the referent , in the focus condition , was longer at the 350 msec and 1250 msecSOAs than in the before SOA .  ~(35) - -4 . 1 . R ~ 0 . 001 .

In another study ( Gulndon ,  1982) , using ~ he same on-llne ~ c ~ iva ~ iontechnique , the ~ c ~ ivation of an antecedent by a pronoun was ~ raced  . In this study , it was fo % L~d tha ~ referring ~ o an anteceden ~ not in focus by using a pronoun was detrimental to anaphora resolution  . The delay between reading the anaphor and reins ~ atlngthean ~ eceden ~ was as long as  2400 msec . 
The actlva ~ ion of an anteceden~no ~ in focus by a pronoun takes along ~ ime because ~ he reader is induced : I  ) to search the cache unsuocesfully ;  2 ) to search operating memory with a " sketchy " pronoun :  3  ) to relnsta Ze the referent into the cache . Activation was immediate for ~ heantecedents in focus  . 
As opposed ~ o the previous s~udy where referring to a focused referen ~ using a definite noun phrase hindered anaphora resolution  , no such effect was observed when using a pronoun . This is expected since pronouns signal tha ~ ~ he referent is in the cache  . 

The notion of focusing and the notion that the form of the anaphor signals whether ~ he referen ~ is in focus or no ~ have cognitive support  . Items in focus are items in the cache which is dynamically updated ~ o contain ~ heTmost ~ opical and the R most recen ~ items in the ~ ex  ~  . Because the cache con~alns few items , pronouns should be used ~ o refer to items in focus  . O~her things being equal , anaphora resolution will be easier if the antecedent is in focus  , because ~ he retrieval ~ imes from the cache are much faster ~ hant hose from the operating memory  . Antecedents not in focus are in operating memory . I~ems no ~ in focus are in operating memory . A definite noun phrase , because it is more descriptive ~ hana pronoun , should be used to re~rieve the ~ nteceden ~ from ~ he large set of i~ems in operating memory  . 
However , because ~ here Erleval ~ ime is slow in opera ~ in ~memory  , anaphora resolution is more dlfflcul ~ for i ~ ems~ha ~ areno ~ in focus  . The relns ~ a ~ emen ~ of a man~eceden ~ into ~ he cache effects a ~ oplc shift  . 
The on-llne activation ~ echnique was developed specifically to provide empirical data on the no ~ ion of focus  . 
The ~ dvan ~ age of this technique over conventional memory experiments is that one can ~ est precisely the ~ emporal properties of various analyses and processes occurring durl n~sentence and ter ~ comprehension  . This technique can be used to distinguish between different models of anaphora resolution when ~ hese models are no ~ easily dist inguished on the basis of discourse or dialogue an ~ iysls  .
