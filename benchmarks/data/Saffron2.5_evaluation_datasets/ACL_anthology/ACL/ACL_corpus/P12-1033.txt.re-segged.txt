Abstract
Two decades after their invention , the IBM word-based translation models , widely available in the GIZA ++ toolkit , remain the dominant approach to word alignment and an integral part of many statistical translation systems . Although many models have surpassed them in accuracy , none have supplanted them in practice . In this paper , we propose a simple extension to the IBM models : an `0 prior to encourage sparsity in the word-to-word translation model . We explain how to implement this extension efficiently for largescale data ( also released as a modification to GIZA ++) and demonstrate , in experiments on Czech , Arabic , Chinese , and Urdu to English translation , significant improvements over IBM Model 4 in both word alignment ( up to +6.7 F1) and translation quality ( up to +1.4 Bleu).
1 Introduction
Automatic word alignment is a vital component of nearly all current statistical translation pipelines . Although state-of-the-art translation models use rules that operate on units bigger than words ( like phrases or tree fragments ), they nearly always use word alignments to drive extraction of those translation rules . The dominant approach to word alignment has been the IBM models ( Brown et al , 1993) together with the HMM model ( Vogel et al , 1996). These models are unsupervised , making them applicable to any language pair for which parallel text is available . Moreover , they are widely disseminated in the opensource GIZA ++ toolkit ( Och and Ney , 2004).
These properties make them the default choice for most statistical MT systems.
In the decades since their invention , many models have surpassed them in accuracy , but none has supplanted them in practice . Some of these models are partially supervised , combining unlabeled parallel text with manually-aligned parallel text ( Moore , 2005; Taskar et al , 2005; Riesa and Marcu , 2010).
Although manually-aligned data is very valuable , it is only available for a small number of language pairs . Other models are unsupervised like the IBM models ( Liang et al , 2006; Grac?a et al , 2010; Dyer et al , 2011), but have not been as widely adopted as
GIZA ++ has.
In this paper , we propose a simple extension to the IBM/HMM models that is unsupervised like the IBM models , is as scalable as GIZA ++ because it is implemented on top of GIZA ++, and provides significant improvements in both alignment and translation quality . It extends the IBM/HMM models by incorporating an `0 prior , inspired by the principle of minimum description length ( Barron et al , 1998), to encourage sparsity in the word-to-word translation model ( Section 2.2). This extension follows our previous work on unsupervised part-of-speech tagging ( Vaswani et al , 2010), but enables it to scale to the large datasets typical in word alignment , using an efficient training method based on projected gradient descent ( Section 2.3). Experiments on Czech -, Arabic -, Chinese - and Urdu-English translation ( Section 3) demonstrate consistent significant improvements over IBM Model 4 in both word alignment ( up to +6.7 F1) and translation quality ( up to +1.4 Bleu ). Our implementation has been released as a simple modification to the GIZA ++ toolkit that can be used as a drop-in replacement for GIZA ++ in any existing MT pipeline.
311 2 Method
We start with a brief review of the IBM and HMM word alignment models , then describe how to extend them with a smoothed `0 prior and how to efficiently train them.
2.1 IBM Models and HMM
Given a French string f = f1 ? ? ? f j ? ? ? fm and an English string e = e1 ? ? ? ei ? ? ? e `, these models describe the process by which the French string is generated by the English string via the alignment a = a1, . . . , a j , . . . , am . Each a j is a hidden variables , indicating which English word ea j the French word f j is aligned to.
In IBM Model 1?2 and the HMM model , the joint probability of the French sentence and alignment given the English sentence is
P(f , a | e ) = m ? j=1 d(a j | a j?1, j)t ( f j | ea j ). (1) The parameters of these models are the distortion probabilities d(a j | a j?1, j ) and the translation probabilities t ( f j | ea j ). The three models differ in their estimation of d , but the differences do not concern us here . All three models , as well as IBM Models 3?5, share the same t . For further details of these models , the reader is referred to the original papers describing them ( Brown et al , 1993; Vogel et al , 1996).
Let ? stand for all the parameters of the model.
The standard training procedure is to find the parameter values that maximize the likelihood , or , equivalently , minimize the negative loglikelihood of the observed data : ?? = arg min ? ( ? log P(f | e , ?) ) (2) = arg min ? ? ??????? log ? a
P(f , a | e , ?) ? ?????? (3)
This is done using the Expectation-Maximization ( EM ) algorithm ( Dempster et al , 1977).
2.2 MAP-EM with the `0-norm
Maximum likelihood training is prone to overfitting , especially in models with many parameters . In word alignment , one wellknown manifestation of overfitting is that rare words can act as ? garbage collectors ? ( Moore , 2004), aligning to many unrelated words.
This hurts alignment precision and rule-extraction recall . Previous attempted remedies include early stopping , smoothing ( Moore , 2004), and posterior regularization ( Grac?a et al , 2010).
We have previously proposed another simple remedy to overfitting in the context of unsupervised part-of-speech tagging ( Vaswani et al , 2010), which is to minimize the size of the model using a smoothed `0 prior . Applying this prior to an HMM improves tagging accuracy for both Italian and English.
Here , our goal is to apply a similar prior in a word-alignment model to the word-to-word translation probabilities t ( f | e ). We leave the distortion models alone , since they are not very large , and there is not much reason to believe that we can profit from compacting them.
With the addition of the `0 prior , the MAP ( maximum a posteriori ) objective function is ?? = arg min ? ( ? log P(f | e , ?) P (?) ) (4) where
P (?) ? exp ( ??????0 ) (5) and ????0 = ? e , f ( 1 ? exp ? t ( f | e ) ? ) (6) is a smoothed approximation of the `0-norm . The hyperparameter ? controls the tightness of the approximation , as illustrated in Figure 1. Substituting back into (4) and dropping constant terms , we get the following optimization problem : minimize ? log P(f | e , ?) ? ? ? e , f exp ? t ( f | e ) ? (7) subject to the constraints ? f t ( f | e ) = 1 for all e . (8) We can carry out the optimization in (7) with the MAP-EM algorithm ( Bishop , 2006). EM and MAP-EM share the same E-step ; the difference lies in the 0.4 0.6 0.8 imations ( below ) for ? = 0.05, 0.1, 0.2.
M-step . For vanilla EM , the M-step is : ?? = arg min ? ? ???????? ? ? e , f
E[C(e , f )] log t ( f | e ) ? ???????? (9) again subject to the constraints (8). The count C(e , f ) is the number of times that f occurs aligned to e . For MAP-EM , it is : ?? = arg min ? ( ? ? e , f
E[C(e , f )] log t ( f | e ) ? ? ? e , f exp ? t ( f | e ) ? ) (10) This optimization problem is nonconvex , and we do not know of a closedform solution . Previously ( Vaswani et al , 2010), we used ALGENCAN , a nonlinear optimization toolkit , but this solution does not scale well to the number of parameters involved in word alignment models . Instead , we use a simpler and more scalable method which we describe in the next section.
2.3 Projected gradient descent
Following Schoenemann (2011b ), we use projected gradient descent ( PGD ) to solve the M-step ( but with the `0-norm instead of the `1-norm ). Gradient projection methods are attractive solutions to constrained optimization problems , particularly when the constraints on the parameters are simple ( Bertsekas , 1999). Let F (?) be the objective function in (10); we seek to minimize this function . As in previous work ( Vaswani et al , 2010), we optimize each set of parameters { t (? | e )} separately for each English word type e . The inputs to the PGD are the expected counts E[C(e , f )] and the current word-to-word conditional probabilities ?. We run PGD for K iterations , producing a sequence of intermediate parameter vectors ?1, . . . , ? k , . . . , ? K . Each iteration has two steps , a projection step and a line search.
Projection step In this step , we compute : ? k = [ ? k ? s?F(?k ) ]? (11) This moves ? in the direction of steepest descent (? F ) with step size s , and then the function [?]? projects the resulting point onto the simplex ; that is , it finds the nearest point that satisfies the constraints (8).
The gradient ? F(?k ) is ? F ? t ( f | e ) = ?
E[C ( f , e )] t ( f | e ) + ? ? exp ? t ( f | e ) ? (12) In contrast to Schoenemann (2011b ), we use an O(n log n ) algorithm for the projection step due to Duchi et . al . (2008), shown in Pseudocode 1.
Pseudocode 1 Project input vector u ? Rn onto the probability simplex.
v = u sorted in nonincreasing order ? = 0 for i = 1 to n do if vi ? 1i (? i r=1 vr ? 1 ) > 0 then ? = i end if end for ? = 1 ? (?? r=1 vr ? 1 ) wr = max{vr ? ?, 0} for 1 ? r ? n return w Line search Next , we move to a point between ? k and ? k that satisfies the Armijo condition,
F(?k + ? m ) ? F(?k ) + ? ( ? F(?k ) ? ? m ) (13) where ? m = ? m (? k ? ? k ) and ? and ? are both constants in (0, 1). We try values m = 1, 2, . . . until the Armijo condition (13) is satisfied or the limit m = 20 k that satisfies the Armijo condition.
Fmin = F(?k ) ? min = ? k for m = 1 to 20 do ? m = ? m ( ? k ? ? k ) if F(?k + ? m ) < Fmin then
Fmin = F(?k + ? m ) ? min = ? k + ? m end if if F(?k + ? m ) ? F(?k ) + ? ( ? F(?k ) ? ? m ) then break end if end for ? k+1 = ? min return ? k+1 is reached . ( Note that we don?t allow m = 0 because this can cause ? k + ? m to land on the boundary of the probability simplex , where the objective function is undefined .) Then we set ? k+1 to the point in {? k } ? {? k + ? m | 1 ? m ? 20} that minimizes F.
The line search algorithm is summarized in Pseudocode 2.
In our implementation , we set ? = 0.5 and ? = 0.5. We keep s fixed for all PGD iterations ; we experimented with s ? {0.1, 0.5} and did not observe significant changes in Fscore . We run the projection step and line search alternately for at most K iterations , terminating early if there is no change in ? k from one iteration to the next . We set K = 35 for the large Arabic-English experiment ; for all other conditions , we set K = 50. These choices were made to balance efficiency and accuracy . We found that values of K between 30 and 75 were generally reasonable.
3 Experiments
To demonstrate the effect of the `0-norm on the IBM models , we performed experiments on four translation tasks : Arabic-English , ChineseEnglish , and Urdu-English from the NIST Open MT Evaluation , and the Czech-English translation from the Workshop on Machine Translation ( WMT ) shared task.
We measured the accuracy of word alignments generated by GIZA ++ with and without the `0-norm , and also translation accuracy of systems trained using the word alignments . Across all tests , we found strong improvements from adding the `0-norm.
3.1 Training
We have implemented our algorithm as an opensource extension to GIZA++.1 Usage of the extension is identical to standard GIZA ++, except that the user can switch the `0 prior on or off , and adjust the hyperparameters ? and ?.
For vanilla EM , we ran five iterations of Model 1, five iterations of HMM , and ten iterations of Model 4. For our approach , we first ran one iteration of Model 1, followed by four iterations of Model 1 with smoothed `0, followed by five iterations of HMM with smoothed `0. Finally , we ran ten iterations of Model 4.2
We used the following parallel data : ? ChineseEnglish : selected data from the constrained task of the NIST 2009 Open MT Eval-uation.3 ? Arabic-English : all available data for the constrained track of NIST 2009, excluding United Nations proceedings ( LDC2004E13), ISI Automatically Extracted Parallel Text ( LDC2007E08), and Ummah newswire text ( LDC2004T18), for a total of 5.4+4.3 million words . We also experimented on a larger Arabic-English parallel text of 44+37 million words from the DARPA GALE program.
? Urdu-English : all available data for the constrained track of NIST 2009.

2GIZA ++ allows changing some heuristic parameters for efficient training . Currently , we set two of these to zero : mincountincrease and probcutoff . In the default setting , both are set to 10?7. We set probcutoff to 0 because we would like the optimization to learn the parameter values . For a fair comparison , we applied the same setting to our vanilla EM training as well . To test , we ran GIZA ++ with the default setting on the smaller of our two Arabic-English datasets with the same number of iterations and found no change in Fscore.

Figure 2: Smoothed-`0 alignments ( red circles ) correct many errors in the baseline GIZA ++ alignments ( black squares ), as shown in four ChineseEnglish examples ( the red circles are almost perfect for these examples , except for minor mistakes such as liu-shu?q??ng and meeting-za`izuo ` in ( a ) and .-, in ( c )). In particular , the baseline system demonstrates typical ? garbage-collection ? phenomena in proper name ? shuqing ? in both languages in ( a ), number ?4000? and word ? la?ib??n ? ( lit . ? guest ?) in ( b ), word ? troublesome ? and ? lu`lu `? ( lit . ? land-route ?) in ( c ), and ? block-houses ? and ? dia?oba?o ? ( lit . ? bunker ?) in ( d ). We found this garbage-collection behavior to be especially common with proper names , numbers , and uncommon words in both languages . Most interestingly , in ( c ), our smoothed-`0 system correctly aligns ? extremely ? to ? he?n he?n he?n he?n ? ( lit . ? very very very very ?) which is rare in the bitext.

The word trans column also shows that the number of distinct word translations ( i.e ., the size of the lexical weighting table ) is reduced . The ?? sing . column shows the average fertility of once-seen source words . For Czech-English , the year refers to the WMT shared task ; for all other language pairs , the year refers to the NIST Open MT Evaluation . ? Half of this test set was also used for tuning feature weights.
? Czech-English : A corpus of 4 million words of Czech-English data from the News Commentary corpus.4 We set the hyperparameters ? and ? by tuning on goldstandard word alignments ( to maximize F1) when possible . For Arabic-English and ChineseEnglish , we used 346 and 184 hand-aligned sentences from LDC2006E86 and LDC2006E93. Similarly , for Czech-English , 515 hand-aligned sentences were available ( Bojar and Prokopova ?, 2006).
But for Urdu-English , since we did not have any gold alignments , we used ? = 10 and ? = 0.05. We did not choose a large ?, as the dataset was small , and we chose a conservative value for ?.
We ran word alignment in both directions and symmetrized using grow-diag-final ( Koehn et al , 2003). For models with the smoothed `0 prior , we tuned ? and ? separately in each direction.
3.2 Alignment
First , we evaluated alignment accuracy directly by comparing against goldstandard word alignments.
4This data is available at http://statmt.org/wmt10.
The results are shown in the alignment F1 column of Table 1. We used balanced Fmeasure rather than alignment error rate as our metric ( Fraser and
Marcu , 2007).
Following Dyer et al (2011), we also measured the average fertility , ?? sing ., of once-seen source words in the symmetrized alignments . Our alignments show smaller fertility for once-seen words , suggesting that they suffer from ? garbage collection ? effects less than the baseline alignments do.
The fact that we had to use hand-aligned data to tune the hyperparameters ? and ? means that our method is no longer completely unsupervised . However , our observation is that alignment accuracy is actually fairly robust to the choice of these hyperparameters , as shown in Table 2. As we will see below , we still obtained strong improvements in translation quality when hand-aligned data was unavailable.
We also tried generating 50 word classes using the tool provided in GIZA ++. We found that adding word classes improved alignment quality a little , but more so for the baseline system ( see Table 3). We used the alignments generated by training with word classes for our translation experiments.

Figure 2 shows four examples of ChineseEnglish alignment , comparing the baseline with our smoothed-`0 method . In all four cases , the baseline produces incorrect extra alignments that prevent good translation rules from being extracted while the smoothed-`0 results are correct . In particular , the baseline system demonstrates typical ? garbage collection ? behavior ( Moore , 2004) in all four examples.
3.3 Translation
We then tested the effect of word alignments on translation quality using the hierarchical phrasebased translation system Hiero ( Chiang , 2007). We used a fairly standard set of features : seven inherited from Pharaoh ( Koehn et al , 2003), a sec-setting align F1 (%) Bleu (%) t ( f | e ) t(e | f ) 2008 2009 1st 1st 70.8 41.1 43.7 1st 2nd 70.7 41.1 43.8 2nd 1st 70.7 40.7 44.1 2nd 2nd 70.9 41.1 44.2 Table 4: Optimizing hyperparameters on alignment F1 score does not necessarily lead to optimal Bleu . The first two columns indicate whether we used the first - or second-best alignments in each direction ( according to F1); the third column shows the F1 of the symmetrized alignments , whose corresponding Bleu scores are shown in the last two columns.
ond language model , and penalties for the glue rule , identity rules , unknownword rules , and two kinds of number/name rules . The feature weights were discriminatively trained using MIRA ( Chiang et al , 2008). We used two 5gram language models , one on the combined English sides of the NIST 2009 Arabic-English and ChineseEnglish constrained tracks (385M words ), and another on 2 billion words of English.
For each language pair , we extracted grammar rules from the same data that were used for word alignment . The development data that were used for discriminative training were : for ChineseEnglish and Arabic-English , data from the NIST 2004 and NIST 2006 test sets , plus newsgroup data from the half of the NIST 2008 test set ; for Czech-English , a training set of 2051 sentences provided by the
WMT10 translation workshop.
The results are shown in the Bleu column of Table 1. We used case-insensitive IBM Bleu ( closest reference length ) as our metric . Significance testing was carried out using bootstrap resampling with 1000 samples ( Koehn , 2004; Zhang et al , 2004).
All of the tests showed significant improvements ( p < 0.01), ranging from +0.4 Bleu to +1.4 Bleu.
For Urdu , even though we didn?t have manual alignments to tune hyperparameters , we got significant gains over a good baseline . This is promising for languages that do not have any manually aligned data.
Ideally , one would want to tune ? and ? to maximize Bleu . However , this is prohibitively expensive , especially if we must tune them separately in each alignment direction before symmetrization.
We ran some contrastive experiments to investigate the impact of hyperparameter tuning on translation quality . For the smaller Arabic-English corpus , we symmetrized all combinations of the two top-scoring alignments ( according to F1) in each direction , yielding four sets of alignments . Table 4 shows Bleu scores for translation models learned from these alignments . Unfortunately , we find that optimizing F1 is not optimal for Bleu?using the second-best alignments yields a further improvement of 0.5 Bleu on the NIST 2009 data , which is statistically significant ( p < 0.05).
4 Related Work
Schoenemann (2011a ), taking inspiration from Bodrumlu et al (2009), uses integer linear programming to optimize IBM Model 1?2 and the HMM with the `0-norm . This method , however , does not outperform GIZA ++. In later work , Schoenemann (2011b ) used projected gradient descent for the `1-norm . Here , we have adopted his use of projected gradient descent , but using a smoothed `0-norm.
Liang et al (2006) show how to train IBM models in both directions simultaneously by adding a term to the loglikelihood that measures the agreement between the two directions . Grac?a et al (2010) explore modifications to the HMM model that encourage bijectivity and symmetry . The modifications take the form of constraints on the posterior distribution over alignments that is computed during the E-step . Mermer and Sarac?lar (2011) explore a Bayesian version of IBM Model 1, applying sparse Dirichlet priors to t . However , because this method requires the use of Monte Carlo methods , it is not clear how well it can scale to larger datasets.
5 Conclusion
We have extended the IBM models and HMM model by the addition of an `0 prior to the word-to-word translation model , which compacts the word-to-word translation table , reducing overfitting , and , in particular , the ? garbage collection ? effect . We have shown how to perform MAP-EM with this prior efficiently , even for large datasets . The method is implemented as a modification to the opensource toolkit GIZA ++, and we have shown that it significantly improves translation quality across four different language pairs . Even though we have used a small set of goldstandard alignments to tune our hyperparameters , we found that performance was fairly robust to variation in the hyperparameters , and translation performance was good even when goldstandard alignments were unavailable . We hope that our method , due to its simplicity , generality , and effectiveness , will find wide application for training better statistical translation systems.
