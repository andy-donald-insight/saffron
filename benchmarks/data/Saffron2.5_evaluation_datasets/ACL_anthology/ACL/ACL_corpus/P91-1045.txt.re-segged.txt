The notion of semantic roles is usually attributed to Fillmore  \[8\]  , however its history can be traced backthrough Tesni Sre  \[16\] to Panini . 
Following this tradition , many researcher sec-ognize their usefulness in the description of language -- even if they do not agree on their significance  \[7\]  . However , a weak or strong commitment to this notion does notelude the fact that it proves to be very difficult to settle on a finite set of labels along with their formal definitions  . The dilemma resulting from this challenge is wellknown : to require a univocal identification by each role results in an increase in their number while to abstract their semantic content gives rise to an inconsistent set  . If a finite set is possible , one has to find a proper balance between these two extremes  . As a result , every flavor of roles have been used from time to time in linguistics  ( e . g . , GB , in the spirit of Fillmore , HPSG , in the line of situation semantics ) , and also in AI\[10 , see also 4\] . 
Between the total refusal to use those labels ( as in GPSG ) and the acceptance of individual roles ( as in HPSG ) there is a wide range of proposals on what constitute a good set of L  ( inguistic ) -Roles\[7\] and , as a consequence , on the way to differentiate between them and define them  . Most of the definitions have been based on the referential properties that can be associated with each role bearer  ( e . g . an AGENT is a volitional animatentity ) . Even if this approach is necessary at one time or another  , this kind of definition inevitably leads to either the " let's create anothe role " or the " let's abstract its definition " syndromes  . Properties are not always of the static kind though  . Sometimes , dynamic properties are also used ( e . g . an AGENT is the perceived instigator of the action  )  . 
Since one of the desired characteristic of a roles system is the power to discriminat events  \[5\]   ( another " desired " property being to offer an easier selection of grammatical functions  )  , the recognition of semantic roles should be linked to the interpretation f the event  , that is to their dynamic properties . In a study on locative verbs in French , Boons \[3\] has convincingly shown the importance of taking into account aspectual criteria in the description of a process  , suggesting that GOAL and SOURCE roles should be reinvesti-gated in the light of those criteria  . It is our hypothesis that proliferation of roles is a natural phenomenon caused by the specialized properties required by the interpretation of a predicate within a specific semantic field : to overlook these properties yields the overgeneralization already mentionned  . The best way to approach the expansion /contraction dilemma is to search for the minimal relations required for a dynamic interpretation f events  ( in terms of their aspectual criteria and through an identification of all the participants in  i0  . 
Our first step toward this abstraction was to consider each participant  ( individuals or properties ) either as a localized entity ( a token ) or alocation ( a place )  , and to determine its role in the realization of the process expressed by the predicate  . The model exhibits some common points with a localist approach  \[1  , 11\] since it recognizes ( in an abstract sense ) the importance of spatiotemporal " regions " in the process of individuation of events  \[14\]  . To express the change of localization ( again in an abstract sense )  , the notion of transitions is used . The entire construction is inspired by Petrinet theory  \[15\]: a set S of places , a set T of transitions , a flow relation F : ( SxT )  ~  ( TxS ) and markers are the categories used to define the structure of a process  ( and as a consequence of the events composing it )  . 
For example , the dynamic representation fM axembar que lacaisse sur le cargo  \[3J/Max em-barks the crate on the cargoboat can be analyzed in two steps  . First there is a transition from an initial state IS where the crate is not on the cargoboat to a final state FS where the crate is on the cargo boat  . The final state can be expressed by the static passive  , laca is see stem barqude sur le cargo ~ the crate was embarked on the cargoboat  , and is schematized in (2) . One of the argument ( cargoboat ) is used as a localization while the other argument is used as a localized entity  ( crate )  , the THEME according to Gruber\[9\] . The initial state can be expressed ( in this case ) by the negation of the final state and is schematized in  ( 1 )  . The realization of the entire process is then represented by the firing of the net which can be illustrated by the snapshots  ( 1 ) and ( 2 )  .

To integrate the participation of " Max " in the model  , we recognize the importance of Since the cause is understood to be the first entity responsible for the realization of events  \[6\]  , the obvious chematization is (3) . 

It is possible that a recursive definition ( places and transitions ) will be necessary to express " properly " the causation  , the localization of events and processes or the concept of dynamic states  \[2  , 14\] . In that case , the schematiza-tion could then be (4) . But we can achieve the same result through a proper type definition of the transition expressing the cause :  ( sx0-~ ( tx ( ( s x t )  - , ( txs ))) , where " s " is a place and " t " , a transition . 
This approach to semantic roles determination is close to the one under took by Jackendoff  \[12\]  . His identification of each role to a particular argument position in a conceptual relation is given here by the way it participate to the firing of the net  .   ( It is our guess that most of the conceptual relations used by Jackendoff can be expressed within this model  , giving to them an operational interpretation . ) The model has the advantage to give an explicit and simple definition of relations that do not have the same semantic range  ( e . g . CAUSE vs FROM vs AT ) . 
The analysis of locative processes using abstract regions instead of the traditional roles is better because it is  , we think , the real basis of those interpretations . Abstracting away referential properties gives the basic interactions expressed by the predicate  . Specifying those properties within a specific semantic field gives rise to the set of roles we are used to  ( e . g . within the spatial field , schematizations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) express SOURCE and GOAL roles )  . 
With this model we were able to give an operational description of the difference between Max charge des briques dans lecamion/Maxloads bricks in the truck and Maxchargele camion de briques/Maxloads the truck with bricks  . The schematization take into account which participant is responsible for each transition firing and thus can lead us to the " final " place  . As a first approximation of these continuous processes  ,   ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) are proposed ( the direct contribution of the instrument is also introduced  )  . But recognition , as a participant of the quantity of bricks in ( 5 ) and the capacity of the truck in ( 6 )  , results in the schematizations ( 7 ) et ( 8 )   ( both display a specialization of their direct object in order to complete the semantic interpretation  )  .

By its simplicity , the model can thus give rise to " confusion " over some roles  , in accordance with the general tendancy to observe " roles clusters "  . The resulting notation seems also an interesting way to explore the differences between static and dynamic processes  , differences that are not very ' ~ , isual " if one is using a static notation . 
Our research is now directed toward the analysis of the system when more semantic content is used  . We are testing if these adds-on have impacts on its behaviour  , while analyzing if the partial semantic interpretation gives rise to the predicted syntactic forms  ( that is how does each potential participant is grammaticalized  )  .
