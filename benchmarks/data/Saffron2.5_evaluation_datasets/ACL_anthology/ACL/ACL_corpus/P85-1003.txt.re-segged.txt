This paper explores the relations hiDs between a computational meory of temporal representation  ( as developed by James Alien ) and a Iormal linguiStiC theory Oftense ( as developed by Nor Oert Hornstem ) and aspect . It aimstOprow de exph cit answers to four lundamental Questions :  ( 1 ) whatts the computation allustd ~ cat = on forme or = mmves of a hngu = stIc theory  ;   ( 2 ) what~s the computational explanation of the formal grammatical constraints  ;   ( 3 ) what are the processing constraints ~ ml3osed on the learn abdity and marKedness of these theoretical construCt S : and  ( 4 ) what are the constramnts that a hnguist = c theory imposes or  . represent at ? on s . We show that one can effectively exploit ( n ~ , nter face between the language faculty and the cognmve faculties by using hngu=stic constra  , ntstO determine restrt cuons on tile cognitive representations and w cevers a  .

We also claim that the methodology of research developed intins study - - " cross-lever ' investigation of independently motivated formal grammatical theory and computational moclets -  . is a ? owerful paradigm with which to attack representational problems = no aslc cognitive domains  , e . g . . space , t~me , c~u:~ality , etc .

The purpose of this loader~s to work Outan example of how formal grammatical meory and computational models can effectively constrain eacn diners reoresemat Jons  . In ~3art Jcular , I seek to exolore four ! undamental ~ ssues : t . How~s the cho=ce of onmmve structures m grammatical theory to be lustified ?  2  .

What I hopet Os now is that structures and prmcJoles that have to be st toulatg G '~ t the grammatical evelf all out nalurally as consequences of the proDert = es of the algorithms and representations of the underlying comout a honal model  . In sO doing , I will also restnct the class of plausmle computational models tO those that can exclam or incorporate the constraints = m  ; 3 osed by the formal grammatical theory . 
There are a numoer of requirements that must be metmorder for such " cross  . lever'study to succeed .

With these considerations , I have chosen two domains : ( 1 ) tense and ( 2 ) aspect . Tense concerns the Chronological ordering Of situations with resnect tO some reference moment  , usually the moment of s ! 3 e e c h . Aspect = S the study of situation types and perspectives from which a particular situation can be viewed or evaluated  ( cf . Comrie 75 ) The point of departure of this study is two papers :  ( 1 ) for tl ~ e theory of tense , Hornstetn's " Towards a theory of Tense " ( Homstem 77 ) and ( 2 ) tor the cognitive theory of time . James Allen's "? Towarcls a General Theoryot Action and In the following  , I shall list the main results of this study : 1 . 

A better theory of tense with revised primitive tense structures and constraints  . 
We derive a nexDlanatmn of Hornstein's Linear Order Constraint  , anoioserved formal constraint onling u = stic tense  , from propert = es of the constraint propagat = on algorithm of Allen's temporal system  . This shows this formal grammatical constraint need not be learned at  =1  . 
We also show that the rule of R . germanence follows from the hypothes=s that only the matrix clause ant it l~esuo categort zaDle SCOMP or VCOMP can introduce distract S and R points  . Finally , we prove that certain boundedness condition on the flow of m format monOfagrocassmg system leads d = rectly to the locality properly of a constraint on secluences of tense  .

2. Tense
We begin Dy hrstouthmng Hornstem's theory of tense  . Insect = on 2 . 1 . we describe the 13 rtmtt , ves and constramnts on tense of h~s theory . In sect zons 2 . 2 and 2 . 3 . we snow how the 0nmit=ves and constraints can be denved from computat=onal conszder at = on s  . 
2 . 1 Revcs , ons to Hornstem's Theory of Tense Hornstem develops a theory often sew  #th#n the Re ~cnen bachlan framew crk whtch postulates three - theoretical ent it ~ es : S  ( the moment of speech , R ( a relerence point , and E ( the moment of event ) . The key~dea=s that certain linear or Oenngs of the three t ~ meI : o = nts get grammat=cahz  . , ~ lmid the smx bas = ctenses oiEngl , sh .   1 The following ~ s the last of basic tense strOctures :  1  . SIMPLE PASTE , R_S2 . PAST PERFECTE_ . R_S3 . SIMPLEPRESENTS , R,E4 . PRESENT PERFECTE_S . R5 . SIMPLE FUTURES_R,E6 . FUTUREPERFECTS_E~R The notation here demands some explanation  . The underscore symbol " ~" is interpreted as the " less-than " relation among time points whereas the comma symbol  . . . . stands for the " teas-than-or-eQual-to " relatmn  . As an illustration , the present perfect tense denotes a situation in winch the moment of speech is either cotemporaneous or precedes the reference point  , while the moment of event=s strictly before the other two moments  . 
Note that Horn stem also uses the term " assoc = ation " to refer to the comma symbol "  , " . 
Geventhebas=ctense structure for as = mole tensed sentence  , them terp retat = on of the sentence that arises from the interact = on oftense and time adverbs ~ s represented by the modih catmn of the posit = on of the R or E points to form a new tense structure wh = Ch we call a aerme Olense structu  , e . In two papers ( Hornstem 77 & Hornstem 81) , Horn stem proposes three formal constraints that hmlt the class of derived tense structures that can be generated from the bas=ctense structures mSu Chawayas to capture the acceptabd = ty of sentences containing temporal adverbs  ( e . g . . now , yesterday , tomorrow ) , temporal connechves ( e . g . , when . before , after ), and md = rect speech . In the rest of t inssect = on , I shall examine the adeouacy of these constraints . 
2.1.1 Linear Order Constraint
The Linear Order Constraint ( LOC ) states that t ! ~ . 523-4 ) :  ( 1 ) The linear order of a clenved tense structure must be the same as the hnear order of the basic structure  . 
(2) NO new assoc = at = on~s ; roduce d = n the clerfved tense structure . 
LOGISst = oulated to account for examoles cons = st = ngOfa single temporal adverb such as  ( 4a ) and those w~th two hmead verbs such as ~'32 )  . 24 a . Jonncame homei . " now , at this very moment i . yester Oayiii . " tomorrow 32 a . Jonn left a weekago\[from \] yester clay .

The basic tense structure for 4(ai ) is:

19 follows:
E , R , S ( BAD : violates LOC since new association is produced  ) On the other hand ,  4 ( aii ) is acceptable because the modifier yesler Oay leaves the tense structure unchanged : yes terday 
E , RIS--E , RIS ( OK : does not violate LOC ) The crucial example , however , ms5(c):35c . John has come home i . ? right now ii . " tomorrowiii . yesterday . 
LOC predicts ( wrongly ) that 5 cii is good and 5 ciiibad .   4 But LOC gives the wrong prediction only on the assumot month at the basic tense structures are correct  . To account for 5c . i propose to save the LOC and change the following SRE assocmatmon with the present perfect : 
PRESENT PERFECTE_R.S
With the modified basic tense structure for present perfect  . LOC will give the correct analysm S . 5 cii=s bad because : romprrow
E__R . S--EIS ~ R ( linear order violated ) 5 ci ii is acceptable since : yester day
E__R . S--EIR__S ( OK : no new linear order and no new comma . ) The questmon that naturally arises at this point ms : Why does Hornstein not choose my prooosed SRE structure for the present perfect ? The answer  , I befieve , will become apparent when we examine Hornste , n's Second constra , nt ,  2 . 1 . 2 Rule for Temporal Connectives The rule for temporal connectives  ( RTC ) states that ( p . 539-40): For a sentence of the form Pl . conn-P 2 where " conn "~ s a temporal connect mve such as " when " " before "  , " after " etc . . line up the S pomt ~ of Pt and F 2, that IS . wnte the tense structure of Pl and P2' lininguP the Spoints . Move R2 to under R1 , placing E 2 accorc = ngiy to preserve LOC on the bes = ctense structure  . 
It can be easily seen that my proposed tense structure for present  3  . See-toot ; tote 7~11 Of Morn ~ Itein '$ ~ IO ~' . 
4 There rely Oe clouOts ~ re0a~s II ~ ac = ~ ta ~ ilily of 5dii   . An ~ ui ? 1m~t ~ ot 5? iii ~ a ? clmtal ~ , ~ Dan ~ ( JeSl ~ lrJI4 ll ~ . D . 271\] . A ~ IO . in French , IR e I ~' e ~ t moment ( Comne 76, D . al) . 
perfect does not work with RTC since it produces the wrong predictions for the following two sentences :  \[1 \]" John came when we have arrived . 
\[2\] John comes when we have arrived.
For \[1\] the new analysis is:
E . R ~ S - - - E , R ~ S
II
E  ~ R . SEIR ~ S which does not violate the RTC and hence predicts  ( wrongly ) that \[1\]=s acceptable . Similarly , for\[2\], the new analys , s is:
S.R,E--S.R.E.(violates RTC)
II
E  ~ R . SEIS , R which prediCtS(wrongly ) that\[2\] is bad . 
This may explain why Horn stem decides to use E_S , R for the present perfect because = t can account for  1 and 2\] with no difficulty . However . I suggest that the correct moves nould be to abandon RTC which has an asymmetrical property  , I . e . , it matters whether Pl or P2 = s put on top , and does not nave a nob wous semant tcexplan at mon . ( See Hornstetn's footnote 20, p . 54, . 3) . My second proooTw31 is then to replace RTC with a Rule of
R . permanence ( RP ) stating that : ( RP ) : Both the S and R points of Pl and P2 must be a hgned without any mamp-latmn of the tense structure for  P2" 
Thus sentence \[3l:3\] . John came when we had arrive cl . 
~sacceptable because its tense structure does not v = otate RP : 
E . R__S(OK : S and R points are
EIRI $ already aligned )
NOW , ~ et us reconsider sentences\[1\] and\[2\] . Sentence \[1\] is not acceptable uncler RP and the new tense structure for present perfect since : 
E.R._S(violatesRP:r.netwoR's
EIR . S are not aligned )
Sentence\[2\], sstill a problem . Here Isnailm a Kemy third proposal , namely , that tnesimple present admits I wo Io as ~ c tense structures : 
SIMPLE PRESENTS.R.E and E.R,S
Given this modification , sentence\[2\] will now be acceptable since : E . R , S(S and R points are aligned )
E  ~ R . S\[4\]John has come when i . " we arrived if . " we had arrived iii . we arrive iv , we have arrived v . " we will arrive The corresponding analysis is as follows : \  [4 '\] i . E__R . S(BAD )
E . RmS if . E__R . S(BAD)
E__R__Siii.E__R.S(OK )
E.R . Siv . E~R . S(OK)
EoR , Sv . E~R , S(BAD)

We can see that the proposed theory correctly predicts allol the five cases  . Therets . however , an apparent counter . example to RP which , unlike RTC , is symmetncal , Le . , it does not ma~ter which Of the Pi's = s put on the top  . Cons = der the following two sentences : \[5\]i . John will come when we arrive . 
if . " John arrives when we wi11 come.
RP predicts both 5 i and 5 if will be unacceptable , but 5 i seems to be good . It ts examples like 5 i and 5 if , I believe , that lead Horn stem to propose the asymmetrical rule RTC  . But I think the data are m~s lead=ng because=t seems to be an  , dio syncrasy of Enghsh grammar that 5i = s acceptable . In French , we have to say an ecluwatent of " John will come when wew dlarrive " with the temporal adverb = al expl = c ~ tly marked with the future tense  ( Jespersen 6 ~ , p . 264) . Thus . the acceptability of sentences like 5i can be explained Oya ! or mc = ple of Economy of Speech allowing us toom = the future tense of the temporal adverbial if the matrix clause is already marked w ~ th the tuture tense  . 
2.1.3 Sequences of Tense
Now , we clescribe the third and final grammatical constraint on sequences of tense  . Consider the following sentences : \[6\] John said a week ago that Mary ( a ) will leave in 3 days . 
b ) would
In the ( a ) sentence , the temporal interpret at mn of the embedded sentence is evaluated w = th respect to the moment of speech  . 
Thus . for instance ,   \[6a \] means that Mary's leaving is 3 days alter present moment of speech . On the other hand , the ( b ) sentence has the temporal intemretatlon of the embedded sentence evaluated with respect to the interpretation of the matrix clause  , Le . ,  \[6b \] means that Mary's leaving is 4 days before the moment of speech . 
To account for the sequence of tense in reported spee Ch  , Hornstein proposes the following rule : ( SOT ) : For a sentence of the form " P1 that P2"' assign S 2 with
E1?
In general , for an n . level embedded sentence , SOT states that : assign Sn with En . 1 ( Hornslem 81, p . 140) . With the SOT rule ,   \[6a \] and \[6b \] will be analyzed as follows : \ [6a '\] a week ago

Et . Rlu S1
S2__R2 , E 2 ==> E 2 is 3 days\[afterSI in three days\[s ~'\] a weekago 

EI . RI~Sl

S2 uR2 . E2
I in three day s ==> E2 is 4 days
Defore SI
The local property of SOT , Le . , linking occurs only between nth and ( n-1 ) th level , has an ~ ce conseouence : , t ex0tams wny a third level nested sentence like \[7\]:  \  [7 \] John said a week ago ( a ) that Harry would 0 elieve in 3 days ( b ) that Mary ( i ) will leave for London in 2 days ( c )   ( ii ) would has only two temporal readings : ( 1 ) sn7 ( ci )  . Mary's leaving is two days after the moment of speech  , and (2) m7(cii ) , Mary's leaving Js two clays Oetore the moment Of speech  . In part = cular , there~s not a temporal reading corresponding to the situatmon fn which Mary's leaving mshve days before the moment of speech  . We would obt a , n theth = rd reading if SOT allowed nonlocal hnking  , e . g . , ass=gned S3 with E1 . 
2 . 2 Explanations of the Formal Constraints In the prewous section  , we have examined three formal constraints on the denvatmn of complex tense structures from the O as  , ctense structures : (1) LOC . (2) RP , and (3) SOT . NOw , I want to show how the LOC falls out naturally from the computat=onal propert ms of a temporal reasoning system along the line suggested by Allen  ( Allen 84 , Allen 83) , and also how the RP and SOT constraints have mtuit we computat=on almotwation  . 
The bes , sofAllen's comDutat=onal systemts a temporal ogic based on intervals instead of time points  . The temporal logic cons=stS of seven basic relations and their mveraes  ( Allen 84 , 
D .129, figure 1): inverse

X equal Y == X X X

X overlaps Yooi X X X

The reasoning schemets a form of constraint propagation in a network of event nodes hnKed by temporal relat  , on smps . For instance , the situat = on asclescribed in the sentence " John arrived when we came " is represented by the network : 
A--(><mmi=)-->B\/(<)~,~(<1

NOW where A = John's arrival and B = Our coming This network means that both event A and event B are before now  , the moment of speech , while A can be before , alter or s = multaneous with B . 
When new temporal relatlons mos are added , the system maintains consistency among events by or oo agat  , ng the effects of the new relatmns moswaa TaO/e ol Translt ~ wty Re/at ~ on smps that tells the system how to deduce the set of adm=s s=ble relat = on smos between events A and C given the retatlons h = ps between A and B  , and between B and C . Thus , for instance , Irom the relationships " A during B " and " B < C  "  , the system can deduce " A < C " . 
One or ooerty of the constraint propagation algorithm generally=s that furthermlormatlon only causes removal of members from the set of admissible labels  , i . e . , teml=orat relatlonsmDs , between anytwoold events ( Allen 83 , p . 8,35) . NO new label can Deadded to the admissible set once it is created  . 
Let us call Ires property of the constraint propagnt l on algor  , tnm the Delete Labei Condit = on ( DLC) . DLC can be mtero reted as a k=nd of reformation monotonicity condition on the temocral representation  . 
Let u5 further restrict Allen's temooral logic to instantaneous intervals  .  ~ . e . . each event corresponds to a single moment of time  . 
The restricted logic has only one or , mit were lat , on ,  < , and three ctner denved relat , ons : < ,  > , and > . There is a straightforward : rans lat = on of Hornstein's SRE notation = n to the network re =  ) resent a ' Jon , namely , replace each comma symbol " , " by < ( or > . witr the event symbols reverse their roles ) and each underscore symbol " ~" by > ( or < with similar a ? liustment on the event symbols  )  . Thus , a tense structure such as : E_R , S can be represented as : s-(>)->E (>=) (>)

With this representation scheme , we can prove the following theorem : ~1 ) DLC--LOC

Let A and Brangeover S , A1E and A = B . There are five bas = ctypes olviolations of the LOC:  1  . A_B--B_A2 . AB-,A,B3 . A_B -- . , B . A4 . A , B--B , A5 . A , B- . , B_A We can see that each of these cases ~ s a v = olatlon of the DLC  . To spell this out . we have tt ~ e following operations on the constraint network corresponding tO the above v lolat = ons of the LOC : f '  . A-(<)-)'B--A-(>)->B2' . A -(<) -> B -- A .  (< = ) . ) B3' . A . (<) . > B -- A . (>=) -> B4' . A . (< = ) . > B--A-t >=) > B5" . A . (<=) -> B--A . (>) -> BIn each of these cases , the operation involves the addihon of new members to the adm=s s = Dleset  . Th=s=s ruled out Ioy DLC . Thus , we have the result that if LOC=s wolated , then DLC=s v=olated . In other words . DLC--LOC .   5 -- I The second constraint : obe accounted for is the RP which effecbvely states that  ( a ) the 50omts of the matrix clause and the temporal adverb = al must be ~ clent = cal  . and ( b ) the IR !0dints of the matrix clause and the temporal a Overbml must be ~ dent = cal  . On enypothests for th , s rule is that : ( H 1 ) Only the matrix clausemtrocluces distract S and R points  . 
in other words , the non-subcate < Jonzable temporal adjuncts do net a done wS and R points  . 
H1 has to be modifie O slightly to ta V , e the case of embedded sentence = n to account , namely , Revised RP ) : Only the matrix clause and the subcategorizable SCOMP or VCOMP can introduced = stinctS and R points  . 
where SCOMP and VCOMP stand for sentent = al complement and S  . The?om , e~eo~thssIhe~n~'nm true . 
22 verbal complement respectively . The interesting point is that both the rewsed RP and the locality property of SOT can be easily implemented  , n processing systems which have certain Oounoe oness constraint on the phrase structure rules  ( e . g . ,  , nformation cannot move across more than one bounding node  )  . 
To illustrate this . let us consider the following tense interpretation rules embedded in the phrase structure rules Of the 
Lexlcal-Funct , onal Grammar:
S--NP VP($S-POINT ) = NOW
VP--V ( NP )   ( ADVP )   ( S ' )   ( $ S-POINT )  =   ( TE-POINT ) if ( $ tense ) = PAST
NOW 0 tnerwise
ADVP ~ AdvS
S'--COMPS
Adv ~ when ( TTREL ) = < . > . = , m . mibefore ( TTREL ) => The S rule introduces a new Spoint and sets its value to now  , The VP rule has two effects : ( I ) it does not introduce new S or R points for the temooral adveriolal phrase  , thus imohcltly incorporating the revised RP rule , and ( 2 ) it looks at the tense of the embedded sential comolement  , setting the value of its Spoint to that of the E point of the higher clause if the tense is past  , and to now , otherwise . Thus . tnth~s way , the second effect accomplishes what the SOT rule demands  . 
2.3 Implications for Learning
If the revisions to Hornstem's theory Oftense are correct  , the natural cluest = onto de asked is : FlOWdO speakers attain such Knowledge ? This Question has two Darts :  ( 1 ) How do spea~ers acquire the formal constraints on SRE derivation ? and  ( 2 ) How do speakers learn to associate the appropriate SRE structures with the basz C tenses of the language ? Let us consider the first sub -Question  . In the case of LOC , we have a neat answer . . the constraint need NOT be learned at all ! We have shown that LOC falls out naturally as a consequence of the architecture and processing algorithm ot the computational system  . AS regards the constraint RP . the learner hast O acquire something similar to Hr  . But H1 IS a fairly simple hypothes~s that does not seem to require induct = o nonextens wehn gmstic data  . 
Finally , as we have shown = n the previous section , the bounde Qness of the flow of information ol a or ocessmg system leads directly to ~ helocality or ooerty of the SOT  . The part Tcular linking of S and E points as stipulated by the SOT  , however , is a parameter of the iJnwersal Grammar that has tO be fixed  . 
What about the second sub . question ? How do speake ~ ~ earn to pair SRE conhguratlons wllh the basic tenses ? There are  24 possible SRE configurations seven of which get grammat  , calized . Here I want to prooose a principle of marKeOness ol SRE structures that has a natural computational motivation  . 
Let us recall our restrictive temporal logic of instantaneous interval with one primitive relation  ,  < , and three derived relations : < ,  > , and > . Represent a SRE configuration as follows:
S  ~ E
The admissible labels are among < .  < =, >, > =  . So there are altogether 64 possible configurations that can be classified into three types :  ( 1 ) In consistent labelings ( 16 )   . e . g .   . 
S\--(>)-~E ? (<) (<)
R ( 2 ) Labelings that do not constrain the SE given the labelings of SR and RE  ( 32 )  , e . g . : s--(?)- . ~ E (<) (>)
R link ( 3 ) Labelings that are consistent and the SE ) in kisc0nstra~ned by the SR and RE\]~nk ( 16 )  , e . g . .
s-(<)->E (<) (<)

If we assume that labehngs of the third type corres POndt Otheunmark  , edSRE configurations , the following division of unmar Ke O and marked configurations is obtained : 
UN MARKED MARKED

E . RoS



S , RoE


PAST PERFECTE ~ SoR
SIMPLE PASTE . SoR
PRESENT PERFECTEoS , R
SIMPLE PRESENTE.S,R
SIMPLE PRESENTSIE oR
SIMPLE FUTURES oE.R
S , EmR





R,E ~ S





There are only eight unmarked tense structures corresponding to the sixteen SRE netwo ~ configurations of type  3 network rebresentations , e . g . , the Past Perfect ( E_R_S ) has the tollowing two configurations :
S--t :>) . -* ES-i (>=) --> E (>) . , VI (>)(>) ~;>)

The interesting result is that five out of the six basic tenses have unmarked SRE configurations  . This agrees largely with our pretheoretlcal intuit = on that the SRE configurations that correspond to the basic tenses should be more " unmarked " than other possible SRE configurations  . The fit . however , is not exact because the future perfect tense becomes the marked tense in this classification  . 
Another prediction by this principle of markedneas is that both the simple future  ( S_R . E ') and distant luture ( S_R_E ) are unmarked . It would 0e interesting to find out whether there are languages = n which the distant tuture actually gets grammat = calized  . 
The final point tO be made=s about the second type of label mgs  . There are two Other possible ways of grouping the laOehngs :  ( 1 ) given SR and SE . those labehngs ~ n winchRE~s constrained , and (2) given SE and HE . those in which SR is constrained . But these types of grouping are less likely because they would yield mes~mple present tense as a marked tense  . 
Thus . they can be rule Oouti Oy relatively few linguistic data  . 
3. Verb Aspect
Incons = clenng the problem of tense , we have restricted ourselves to a subset of Aliens temporal logic  , namely , using a temporal structure <: T . _ <> with h near or a enng of time points . TO make use of the full Dower of Allen's temporal logic  , we now turn to the problem of verb aspect . 
The two mare problems of the study of verb aspect are the correct charac ! erizat ~ on of  ( 1 ) the three funclamental types of verb predt cat lon according to the situation types that they signify  . .
state , process and event , and ( 2 ) the p ( = rspect wes from which a situation ts viewed , or its truth evaluated--s~mpte or progre SSive . 6 in the first part of his paper . Allen attempts to prowdea formal account of * he state/process/even '  , d~s~mct lonusing atem Dorallogic . However . I be heve that htScharacten zahon fa?ls to capture welt  . Known patterns of tense=mot ; cations , and does not make the distinction io etween situation types and perspective types funclamental to any adequate account of verb aspect  . In the next 3ect = on . I will present some data that an , /theory of verb aspect must be able to explain .

3.2.3 Process
A process verb can be true only at an interval larger than a single moment  . This property differs crucially frommat of the statwes  . 
( Pl ): OCCUR(p , t)--per(t ) ( P2): OCCUR(p , t)--(Vt')(per(t')ArC_t--OCCUR(p , t ' ) ) The following theorem shows that for a process verb  , the progressive verb form entails the perfect form  . 
(P . THEOREM ) OCCUR(PROG(p , t )) -- (3 t ') ( per(t ') At ' < tA


OCCUR(PROG(p , t )) -- morn(t)A"~OCCUR(p . t)A(3t ') ( tdt ' AOCCUR(p . t ')) -- . . . OCCUR(p . t ') for some r such that tdt'--3m1Et' . ml < t(slnc et dt')--3m2Et' . ml < m2 < t ( by denslty of t = mepolnts ) Let t " be the interval\[m1 . m2\] Then . we have t "( t and t " Ct ' . By ( P2) . we have OCCUR(p , t ") . That is , 0 has occurred . -- I . 
The charactenzat , on of process verb by Allen ( msO . 2 ) is less sat=slactory because ~ t combines both the notion of Drogress we asDect  ( his " OCCURRING " ) and me process verb into the same axiom Furthermore  . the difference between me predicate " OCCUR " and " OCCURRING "~ snot adequately exolamed in his paper  . 
3.2.4 Event
An event verb shares an ~ moortant proDerty with a brocess verb  . namely . , t can be true only at a non . instantaneous interval . 
( El ): OCCUR ( e . t)--!bet(t)(E2): OCCUR(e . t)--(Vr ) ( per(t ') ArCt--"~OCCUR(e , r ) The following theorem snows that the ~ rogresslve form of an event verb entads the negal ~ on of the perfect form  . 
( E-THEOREM ): OCCUR ( PROG ( e . t )) --'-, (3 r ) ( per(t ') Ar < tA


AS in the ~ roof of ( P . THEOREM ) . we can find a non-~nstantaneous intervalt " such that t "< t and t " Ct ' Butor any such t "  . we have OCCUR ( e . t ") Pecause of ( E2) . That is . it cannot be the caset11ate has occurred . -- I . 
Again the crucial property ( El ) is not captured by Allen's charactenzat = on of events  ( msO . 1 ) . 
3 . 3 Const ra in t on tempora l in terpretat ions involving When To account for the variety of aspect interpretations as presented in section  3  . 1 . 2 , I propose the following constraint on ( C-ASPECT\]:Let " dynamic " stand for a process or event  . 
( a ) simple/dynamic . -* morn(t ) ( b ) simple/state . .- per(t ) ( c ) progressive/dynamic - . -* per ( t ) / k_CPerspeCtive is a way of looking at the situate on type  . For processor event , the simple aspect treats U~e situation as an instantaneous interval even though the situation ~ tself may not be instantaneous  . For state , the simple aspect retains its duration . 
The progressive aspect essentially views a process or event from its inter = or  , thus requiring a stance in which the situation is a non  . instantaneous interval and the admissible temporal relationship to be the C_ relations  , i . e . , s , s ~, I , fi . d . di , eoual .

In this paper , In aveexam=ned two problems regarding linguistic semantics : tense and as Dect  . Important relationships between al~s ; ract constra , ntsg overningling u = s t , c behavior and a computational scheme to reason a Dout temporal relationships are discussed  . In particular , I have shown that certain formal constraints , such as the Linear Order Constraint on tense , f all out naturally as a consequence of some computational assumptions  . 
The interesting result=s that this formal constraint need not be learned at all  , Another important role of a representation scheme in explaining phenomena that exist on a entirely different-  . linguustic--level is illustrated by the formulation of the C-ASPECT constraint to account for ~ nter pretatlons of sentences conta  , ning temporal connect wes . 
The study of linguistic seman hcs also sheds light on a representation of tJm~hyreveahng the fundamental distractions that must be made  , e . g . . a tensed sentence revolves three distract time points  , and the aspectual interpretations reclu~re instantaneous/non-instantaneous~nterval distinction  .
