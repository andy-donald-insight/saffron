Abstract
We investigate how novel English-derived words ( anglicisms ) are used in a German-language Internet hip hop forum , and what factors contribute to their uptake.
1 Introduction
Because English has established itself as something of a global lingua franca , many languages are currently undergoing a process of introducing new loanwords borrowed from English . However , while the motivations for borrowing are well studied , including e.g . the need to express concepts that do not have corresponding expressions in the recipient language , and the social prestige associated with the other language ( Hock and Joseph , 1996), the dynamics of this process are poorly understood . While mainstream political debates often frame borrowing as evidence of cultural or linguistic decline , it is particularly pervasive in youth culture , which is often heavily influenced by North American trends . In many countries around the globe , hip hop fans form communities in which novel , creative uses of English are highly valued ( Pennycook , 2007), indicative of group membership , and relatively frequent . We therefore study which factors contribute to the uptake of ( hip hop-related ) anglicisms in an online community of German hip hop fans over a span of 11 years.
2 The MZEE and Covo corpora
We collected a ?12.5M word corpus ( MZEE ) of forum discussions from March 2000 to March 2011 on the German hip hop portal MZEE.com . A manual analysis of 10K words identified 8.2% of the tokens as anglicisms , contrasting with only 1.1% anglicisms in a major German news magazine , the Spiegel ( Onysko , 2007, p.114). These anglicisms include uninflected English stems ( e.g ., battle , rapper , flow ) as well as English stems with English inflection ( e.g ., battled , rappers , flows ), English stems with German inflection ( e.g ., gebattlet , rappern , flowen ? battled , rappers , to flow ?), and English stems with German derivational affixes ( e.g ., battlema?ssig , rapperische , flowendere ? battle-related , rapper-like , more flowing ?), as well as compounds with one or more English parts ( e.g ., battleraporientierter , hiphopgangstaghettorapper , maschinengewehrflow ? someone oriented towards battle-rap , hip hop-gangsta-ghetto-rapper , machinegun flow ?). We also collected a ?20M word corpus ( Covo ) of Englishlanguage hip hop discussion ( May 2003 - November 2011) from forums at ProjectCovo.com.
3 Identification of novel anglicisms
In order to identify novel anglicisms in the MZEE corpus , we have developed a classifier which can identify anglicism candidates , including those which incorporate German material ( e.g ., mo?chtegerngangsterstyle ? wannabe gangster style ?), with very high recall . Since we are not interested in well-established anglicisms ( e.g ., Baby , OK ), non-English words , or placenames , our goal is quite different from the standard language identification problem , including Alex (2008)?s inclusion classifier , which sought to identify ? foreign words ? in general , including internationalisms , homographic 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 87.54 94.80 97.74 99.35 99.85 99.96 99.98 Figure 1: Accuracy of the baseline classifer on word lists ; 10-fold CV ; std . deviations ? 0.02 for all cases words , and non-German placenames , but ignored hybrid/bilingual compounds and English words with German morphology during evaluation . Our final system consists of a binary classifier augmented with dictionary lookup for known words and two routines to deal with German morphology ( affixation and compounding).
The baseline classifier We used MALLET ( McCallum , 2002) to train a maximum entropy classifier , using character 1- through 6grams ( including word boundaries ) as features . Since we could not manually annotate a large portion of the MZEE corpus , the training data consisted of the disjoint subsets of the English and German CELEX wordlists ( Baayen et al , 1995), as well as the words used in Covo ( to obtain coverage of hip hop English).
We tested the classifier using 10-fold cross validation on the training data and on a manually annotated development set of 10K consecutive tokens from MZEE . All data was lowercased ( this improved performance ). We excluded from both data sets 4,156 words shared by the CELEX wordlists ( such as Greek/Latin loanwoards common to both languages and homographs such as hat ), 100 common German and 50 common English stop words , all 3-character words without vowels and 1,019 hip hop artists/label names , which reduced the development set from 10K tokens , or 3,380 distinct types , to 4,651 tokens and 2,741 types.
Affix-stripping Since German is a moderately inflected language , anglicisms are often ? hidden ? by German morphology : in geflowt ? flowed ?, the English stem flow takes German participial affixes . We therefore included a template-based affix-stripping preprocessing step , removing common German affixes before feature extraction . Because of the possibility of multiple prefixation or suffixation ( e.g . rum-ge-battle (? battling around ?) or deep-er-en (? deeper ?)), we stripped sequences of two prefixes and/or three suffixes . Our list of affixes was built

Compound-cutting Nominal and adjectival compounding is common in German , and loanword compounds are commonly found in MZEE : (1) a . chart|tauglich (? suitable for the charts ?) b . flow|maschine|ma?ssig (? like a flow machine ?) c . Rap|vollpfosten (? rap dumbasses ?) Since these contain features that are highly indicative of German ( e.g . - lich #, a ?, and pf ), we devised a compound-cutting procedure for words over length l (=7): if the word is initially classified as German , it is divided several ways according to the parameters n (=3), the number of cuts in each direction from the center , and m (=2), the minimum length of each part . Both halves are classified separately , and if the maximum anglicism classifier score out of all splits exceeds a target confidence c (=0.7), the original word is labeled a candidate anglicism . Parameter values were optimized on a subset of compounds from the development set.
Dictionary classification When applying the classifier to the MZEE corpus , words which occur exclusively in one of the German and English CELEX wordlists are automatically classified as such . This improved classifier results over tokens and types , as seen in Table 1 in the comparison of token and type precision for the dict/nodict conditions.
Evaluation We evaluated our system by adjusting the classifier threshold to obtain a recall level of 95% or higher on anglicism tokens in the development set ( see Table 1). The final classifier achieved a per-token precision of 70% ( per type : 67%) at 95% recall , a gain of 7% (9%) over the baseline.
Our system identified 1,415 anglicism candidate types with a corpus frequency of 100 or greater , out vestigation ; 441 (31.1%) were either established anglicisms , place names , artist names , and other loanwords , and 123 (8.7%) were German words.
4 Predicting the fate of anglicisms
We examine here factors hypothesized to play a role in the establishment ( or decline ) of anglicisms.
Frequency in the English Covo corpus We first examine whether a word?s frequency in the English-speaking hip hop community influences whether it becomes more frequently used in the German hip hop community . We aligned four large (>1M words each ) 12-month time windows of the Covo and MZEE corpora , spanning the period 11-2003 through 11-2007. We used the 851 most frequent anglicisms identified in our system to find 106 English stems commonly used in German anglicisms , and compute their relative frequency ( aggregated over all word forms ) in each Covo and MZEE time window . We then measure correlation coefficients r between the frequency of a stem in Covo at time Tt , fEt ( stem ), and the change in log frequency of the corresponding anglicisms in MZEE between Tt and a later time Tu , ? log10 f
G t:u(w ) = log10 f
G u ( w ) ? log10 f
G t ( w ), as well as the corresponding p-values , and coefficients of determination R2 ( Table 2). There is a significant positive correlation between the variables , especially for change over a two-year time span.

U = Uw
U?w is defined as the ratio of the actual number of users of word w ( Uw ) over the expected number of users of w ( U?w ), and DT =
Tw
T?w is calculated analogously fo the actual/expected number of threads in which w is used . U?w and T?w are estimated from a bag-of-words model approximating a Poisson process.
We apply Altmann et al?s model to study the difference in word dynamics between anglicisms and native words . Since we are not able to lemmatize the entire MZEE corpus , this study uses the 851 most common anglicism word forms identified by our system , treating all word forms as distinct.
We split the MZEE corpus into six nonoverlapping windows of 2M words each ( T1 through T6), calculate DUt ( w ), D
T t ( w ) and log10 ft(w ) within each time window Tt . We again measure how well these variables predict the change in log frequency ? log10 ft:u(w ) = log10 fu(w ) ? log10 ft(w ) between the initial time Tt and a later time Tu , with u = t + 1, ..., t + 3.
When measured over all words excluding anglicisms , log10 ft , D
U t , and D
T t at an initial time are very weakly (0.0309 < r < 0.0692), but significantly ( p < .0001) positively correlated with ? log10 ft:u . However , in contrast to Altmann et al.?s findings that DU and DT serve better than frequency as predictors of word fate , for the set of anglicisms ( Table 3), all correlations were both negative and stronger , and initial frequency log10 ft ( not dissemination ) is the best predictor , especially as the time spans increase in length . That is , while most words ? frequency change cannot generally be predicted from earlier frequency , we find that , for anglicisms , a high frequency is more likely to lead to a decline , and vice versa.1.

Finally , from the comparison of timespans in Table 3, we see that the predictive ability ( R2) of the three measures increases as the timespan for ? log10 f becomes longer , i.e ., frequency and dissemination effects on frequency change do not operate as strongly in immediate time scales.2.
5 Conclusion
In this study , we examined factors hypothesized to influence the propagation of words through a community of speakers , focusing on anglicisms in a German hip hop discussion corpus . The first analysis presented here sheds light on the lexical dynamics between the English and German hip hop communities , demonstrating that English frequency correlates positively with change in a borrowed word?s frequency in the German community?this result is not shocking , as the communities are exposed to shared inputs ( e.g ., hip hop lyrics ), but the strength of this correlation is highest in a two-year timespan , suggesting a time lag from the frequency of hip hop terms in English to the effects on those terms in German . Future research here could profitably focus on this relationship , especially for terms whose success in the English and German hip hop communities is highly disparate . Investigation of those terms could suggest non-frequency factors which affect a word?s variables ) in this regard.

success or failure.
The second analysis , which compared three measures used by Altmann , Pierrehumbert , and Motter (2011) to predict lexical frequency change , found that log10 f , D
U , and DT did not predict frequency change well for non-anglicism words in the MZEE corpus , but that log10 f in particular does predict frequency change for anglicisms , though this correlation is inverse ; this finding relates to another analysis of loanwords . In a diachronic study of loanword frequencies in two French newspaper corpora , Chesley and Baayen (2010, p.1364-5) found that high initial frequency was ? a bad omen for a borrowing ? and found an interaction effect between frequency and dispersion ( roughly equivalent to dissemination in the present study ): ? As dispersion and frequency increase , the number of occurrences at T2 decreases .? A view of language as a stylistic resource ( Coupland , 2007) provides some explanation for these counterintuitive findings : An anglicism which is used less often initially but survives is likely to increase in frequency as other speakers adopt it for ? cred ? or ingroup prestige . However , a highly frequent anglicism seems to become increasingly undesirable?after all , if everyone is using it , it loses its capacity to distinguish ingroup members ( consider , e.g ., the widespread adoption of the term bling outside hip hop culture in the US ). This circumstance is reflected by a drop in frequency as the word becomes passe ?. This view is supported by ethnographic interviews with members of the German hip hop community : ? Yeah , [ the use of anglicisms is ] naturally overdone , for the most part . It?s targeted at these 15, 14-year-old kids , that think this is cool.
The crowd ! Ah , cool ! Yeah , it?s true?the crowd , even I say that , but not seriously .? -? Peter ?, 22, beatboxer and student at the Hip Hop Academy Hamburg.
In summary , the analyses discussed here leverage the opportunities provided by largescale corpus analysis and by the uniquely language-focused nature of the hip hop community to investigate issues of sociohistorical linguistic concern : what sort of factors are at work in the process of linguistic change through contact , and more specifically , which word-extrinsic properties of stems and wordforms condition the success and failure of borrowed English words in the German hip hop community.
