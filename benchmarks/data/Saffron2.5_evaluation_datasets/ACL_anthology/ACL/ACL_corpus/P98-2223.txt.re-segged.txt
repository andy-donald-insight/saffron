Abstract
In this paper , we describe a machine translation system called Palm Tree which uses the " pattern-based " approach as a fundamental framework  . The pure pattern-based translation framework has several issues  . One is the performance due to using many rules in the parsing stage  , and the other is inefficiency of usage of translation patterns due to the exact-matching  . To overcome these problems , we describe several methods ; pruning techniques for the former , and introduction of example-based processing for the latter  . 
1 Introduction
While the World-Wide Web ( WWW ) has quickly turned the Internet into a treasury of information for everynetizen  , nonnative English speakers now face a serious problem that textual data are more often than not written in a foreign language  . This has led to an explosive popularity of machine translation  ( MT ) tools in the world . 
Under these circumstances , we developed a machine translation system called Palm Tree I which uses the pattern-based translation  \[6  , 7\] formalism . 
The key ideas of the pattern-based MT is to employ a massive collection of diverse transfer knowledge  , and to selec the best translation among the translation candidates  ( ambiguities )  . This is a natural extension of the example-based MT in the sense that we incorporate not only sentential correspondences  ( bilingual corpora ) but every other level of linguistic ( lexical , phrasal , and collocational ) expressions into the transfer knowledge . It is also a rule-based counterpart to the word ngrams of the stochastic MT since our patterns intuitively captures the frequent collocations  . 
Although the pattern-based MT framework is promising  , there are some drawbacks . One is the speed , since it uses many rules when parsing . The other is inefficiency of usage of translation patterns  , 1 Using this system , IBM Japan releases a MT product called " Internet King of Translation " which can translate an 
English Web pages into Japanese.
since it uses the exact-match when matching translation patterns with the input  . We will describe several methods for accelerating the system performance for the former  , and describe the extension by using the example -based processing  \[4  , 8\] for the latter . 
2 Pattern-based Translation
Here , we briefly describe how the pattern-based translation works  . ( See\[6, 7\] for details . ) A translation pattern is a pair of source CFG -rule and its corresponding target CFG-rule  . The followings are examples of translation patterns  . 
( pl ) take:VERB:la look at NP:2=~VP:I
VP:I ?= NP:2 wo ( dobj ) miru ( see ) : VERB : l ( p2 ) NP:IVP:2=vS:2S:2?=NP:IhaVP : 2 ( p3 ) PRON : I = ~ NP : INP : I ?: PRON : I The ( pl ) is a translation pattern of an English colloquial phrase " take a look at  , " and ( p2 ) and ( p3 ) are general syntactic translation patterns . In the above patterns , a left-half part ( like " ABC = ~ D " ) of a pattern is a source CFG-rule , the right-half part ( like " A ? := BCD " ) is a target CFG-rule , and an index numbe represents correspondence of terms in the source and target sides and is also used to indicate a head term  ( which is a term having the same index as the lefthand side  2 of a CFG-rule )  . 
Further , some features can be attached as matching conditions for each term  . 
The pattern-based MT engine performs a CFG-parsing for an input sentence with using source sides of translation patterns  . This is done by using chart-type CFG-parser . The target structure is constructed by the synchronous derivation which generates a target structure by combining target sides of translation patterns which are used to make a parse  . 
Figure 2 shows how an English sentence " She takes a look at him " is translated into Japanese  .

The source part of ( p3 ) matches " She " and " him , "the source part of ( pl ) matches a segment consisting " take a look at " and a NP  ( " him " ) made from ( p3 )  , and finally the source part of ( p2 ) matches a whole sentence . A target structure is constructed by combining target sides of  ( pl )  , ( p2) , and ( p3) . Several terms without lexical forms are instantiated with translation words  , and finally a translated Japanese sentence " kanojo  ( she ) ha ( subj ) kare ( he ) wo ( dobj ) miru ( see ) " will be generated . 
3 Pruning Techniques
As mentioned earlier , our basic principle is to use many lexical translation patterns for producing natural translation  . Therefore , we use more CFG rules than usual systems . This causes the slowdown of the parsing process . We introduced the following pruning techniques for improving the performance  . 
3 . 1 Lexical Ru le Preference Pr inc ip le We call a CFG rule which has lexical terms in the right hand side  ( RHS ) a lexical rule , otherwise a normal rule . The lexical rule preference principle ( or LRPP invalidates arcs made from normal rules in a span in which there are arcs made from both normal rules and lexical rules  . 
Further , lexical rules are assigned cost so that lexical rules which has more lexical terms are preferred  . 
For instance , for the span\[take , map \] of the following input sentence , 
He takes a look at a map.
if the following rules are matched ,   ( rl ) take : verb a look at NP ( r2 ) take : verb a NP at NP ( r3 ) take : verb NP at NP ( r4 ) VERB NP PREP NP then , ( r4) is invalidated , and ( rl ) , (r2) , and ( r3) are preferred in this order . 
3 . 2 Le f t - Bound F ixed Exc lus ive Ru le We generally use an exclusivert tle which invali -dates competitive arcs made from general rules for a very special expression  . This is , however , limited in terms of the matching ability since it is usually implemented as both ends of rules are lexical items  . 
There are many expression such that left-end part is fixed but right-end is open  , but these expressions cannot be expressed as exclusive rules  . Therefore , we introduce here a left-bound fixed exclusive ( or LBFE ) rule which can deal with right-end open expressions  . 
Given a span \ [ xy \] for which an LBFE rule matched  , in a span \[ ij \] such that i < x and x < j < y , and in all subspans inside\[xy\] , 
Figure 2: The Effect of an LBFERule * Rules other than exclusive rules are not applied  , and ? Arcs made from nonexclusive rules are inval -idated  . 
Fig . 2 shows that an LBFE rule " VP ~= VERB NP ''3 matches an input . In spans of ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) , arcs made from nonexclusive rules are inval -idated  , and the application of nonexclusive rules are inhibited  . 
Examples of LBFE rules are as follows:
NP ~ DET own NP
NOUN + -- as many as NP
NP ~ most of NP 3.3 Preproeessing
Preprocessing includes local bracketing of proper nouns  , monetary expressions , quoted expressions , Internet addresses , and so on . Conversion of numeric expressions and units , and decomposition of unknown hyphenated words are also included in the preprocessing  . A bracketed span works like an exclusive rule , that is , we can ignore arcs crossing a bracketed span . Thus , accurate preprocessing not only improved the translation accuracy  , but it vis-ibly improved the translation speed for longer sentences  . 
3.4 Experiments
To evaluate the above pruning techniques , we have tested the speed and the translation quality for three documents  . Table 1 shows the speed to translate documents with and without the above pruning techniques  .   4 The fourth row shows the 3This is not an LBFE rule in practice . 
4please note that the t ime shown in this table was recorded about two years ago and the latest version is much faster  . 
number of sentences tested with pruning which become worse than sentences without pruning and sentences with pruning which become better than without pruning  . 
This shows the speed with pruning is about 2 times faster than one without pruning at the same time the translation quality with pruning is kept in the almost same level as one without pruning  . .
4 Extens ion by Example - based Pro - cess ing One drawback of our pattern-based formalism is to have to use many rules in the parsing process  . 
One of reasons to use such many rules is that the matching of rules and the input is performed by the exact-matching  . It is a straightforward ie a to extend this exact -matching to fuzzy-matching so that we can reduce the number of translation patterns by merging some patterns identical in terms of the fuzzy -matching  . We made the following extensions to the pattern -based MT to achieve this example-based processing  . 
4.1 Example-based Parsing
If a term in a RHS of source part of a pattern has a lexical-form and a corresponding term in the target part  , then it is called a \] uzzy-match term , otherwise an exact-match term . A pattern writer can intentionally designate if a term is a fuzzy-match term or an exact-match term by using a double-quoted string  ( for fuzzy-match ) or a single-quoted string ( for exact-match )  . 
For instance , in the following example , a word make is usually a fuzzy-match term since it has a corresponding term in the target side  ( ketsudan-suru )  , but it is a single-quoted string , so it is an exact-match term . Words a and decision are exact-match terms since they has no corresponding terms in the target side  . 
' make ': VERB : la decision = vVP : I
VP:I~=ketsudan-suru : l
Thus , the example-based parsing extends the term matching mechanism of a normal parsing as follows : A term TB matches another matched-term TA  ( LexA , POsB ) s if one of the following conditions holds . 
(1) When a term TB has both LexB and POSB , (11) LexB is the same as LeXA , and PosB is the same as PosA . 
5A matched - term inherits a lexical-form of a term it matches  .

(2) When a term TB has only LexB , (21) LexB is the same as LeXA . 
(22) LexB is a fuzzy-match term , the semantic distance of LexB and LexA is smaller than a criterion  . 
(3) When TB has only PosB , then PosB is the same as RosA . 
4 . 2 P r io r i t i za t ion o f Ru les Many ambiguous results are given in the parsing  , and the preference of these results are usually determined by the cost value calculated as the sum of costs of used rules  . This example-based processing adds fuzzy-matching cost to this base cost  . The fuzzy-matching cost is determined to keep the following order  . 

The costs of ( 12 ) and ( 21 ) are determined by the fuzzy-match criterion value  , since we cannot determine which one of ( 12 ) and ( 21 ) is preferable in general . 
4 . 3 Mod i f i ca t ion of Target Side of Ru les Lexical-forms written in the target side may be different from translation words of matched input word  , since the fuzzy-matching is used . Therefore , we must modify the target side before constructing a target structure  . 
Suppose that a RHS term t t in the target side of a pattern has a lexical-form wt  , t t has a corresponding term t , in the source side , and G matches an input word wi . If wt is not a translation word of wi , then wt is replaced with translation words of w i . 
4.4 Translation Example
Figure 3 shows a translation example by using example -based processing described above  . 
In this example , the following translation patterns are used . 
(p2 ) NP:IVP:2=~S:2S:2?=NP:IhaVP : 2 ( p3 ) PRON : I = ~ NP : INP : I ?: PRON : I ( p4 ) take:VERB:labus:2=~VP:I
VP:I ?= basu:2ninoru:VERB:l
The pattern ( p4) matches a phrase " take a taxi , " since " taxi " and " bus " are semantically similar  . By combining target parts of these translation patterns  , a translation " PRON habasunin or u " is generated  . In this translation , since " basu ( bus ) " is not a correct ranslation of a corresponding source word " taxi  , " it is changed to a correct ranslation word " takusi  ( taxi )  . " Further , PRON is instantiated by " watashi " which is a translation of " I  . " Then a correct translation " watashi hatakusi ninoru " is generated  . 
5 Discussion
Unlike most of existing MT approaches that consist of three major components \[ I  , 2\]-analysis , transfer , and generation - the pattern-based MT is based on asynchronous  model\[5  , 3\] of translation . That is , the analysis of a source sentence is directly connected to the generation of a target sentence through the translation knowledge  ( i . e . , patterns ) . This simple architecture makes it much easier to customize a system for improving translation quality than the conventional MT  , since the management of the ambiguities in 3-component architecture has to tackle the exponential combination of overall ambiguities  . In this simple model , we can concentrate on a single module ( a parser with synchronous derivation )  , and manage most of translation knowledge in a uniform way as translation patterns  . 
Although it is easier to add translation patterns in our system than previou systems  , it is difficult for nonexperts to specify detailed matching conditions  ( or features )  . Therefore , we made a pattern compiler which interprets a simple pattern which a nonexpert writes and converts it into the fullscale patterns including necessary matching conditions  , ( p2) S .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .

Shown in the above example , it is very easy for nonexperts to write these simple patterns  . Thus , this pattern compiler enable nonexpert so customize a system  . In conventional MT systems , an expert is usually needed for each component ( analysis , transfer , and generation ) . 
These advantages can reduce the cost of development and customization of a MT system  , and can largely contribute to rapidly improve the translation quality in a short time  . 
Further , we have shown the way to integrate example-based processing and pattern-based MT  . 
In addition to reduce the total number of translation patterns  , this combination enables us to make a more robust and humanlike MT system thanks to the easy addition of translation pattern  . 
6 Conclusion
In this paper , we have described a pattern-based MT system called Palm Tree  . This system can break 6 practically , some conditional features are attached into verb terms  . 
the current ceiling of MT technologies , and at the same time satisfy three essential requirements of the current market : efficiency  , scalability , and ease-of-use . 
We have described several pruning techniques for gaining better performance  . Further we described the integration of example -based processing and pattern-based MT  , which enables us to make more robust and humanlike translation system  .
