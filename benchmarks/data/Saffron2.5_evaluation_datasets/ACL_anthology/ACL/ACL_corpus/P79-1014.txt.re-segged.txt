1. iNTRODUCTION
A newspaper story about terrorism , war , politics or football is not likely to be read in the same way as a gothic novel  , college catalog or physics textbook . 
Similarly , tneprocess used to understand a casual conversation is unlikely to be the same as the process of understanding a biology lecture or TV situation comedy  . One of the primary differences amongst these various types of comprehension is that the reader or listener will nave different goals in each case  . The reasons a person nan for reading , or the goals he has when engaging in conversation wlll nave a strong affect on what he pays attention to  , how deeply the input is processed , and what information is incorporated into memory . The computer model of understanding described nere addresses the problem of using a reader's purpose to assist in natural language understanding  . This program , the Integrated Partial Parser ( IPP ) ~s designed to model the way people read newspaper stories in a robust  , comprehensive , manner . IPP nanaset of interests , much as a human reader does . At the moment it concentrates on stories about International violence and terrorism  . 
IPP contrasts sharply wlth many other tecnniques which have been used in parslng  . Most models of language processing have had no purpose in reading  . They pursue all inputs with the same dill gence and create the same type of representation for all stories  . The key difference in IPP is that it maps lexl cal input into as high a level representation as possible  , thereby performing the complete understanding process  . Other approaches have invariably first tried to create a preliminary representation  , often a strictly syntactic parse tree , in preparation for real understandlng . 
~ ince high-level , semantic representations are ultimately necessary for understanding  , there is no obvious need for creating a preliminary syntactic representation  , which can be a very difficult task . The isolation of the lexlcal level processing from more complete understanding processes makes it very difficult for hlgn level predictions to influence low-level processing  , which is crucial in IPP . 
On every popular technique for creating a low- level representation of sentences has been the Augmented Transition Networ X  ( ATN )  . Parsers of this sort have been discussed by Woods  \[   11\] and Kaplan \ [ SJ . An ATN-Ii Ke parser was developed by Winograd \ [10  \ ]  . Most ATN parsers nave dealt primarily wltn syntax  , occasionally checking a " few simple semantic properties of words  . A more recent parser wnicn does an isolated syntactic parse was created by Marcus  \[4\]  . TOe important thing to note about all of these parsers is that they view syntactic parsing as a process to be done prior to real understanding  . Even thougn systems of this sort at times make use of semantic information  , they are driven by syntax . Their ~ oal of developing a syntactic parse tree is not an explicit part of the purpcs e of human understanding  . 
the type of understanding done by IPP is in some sense a compromise between the very detailed understanding of This work was supported in part by the Advanced Research  8roJects A ~ e noy of the Department of Defense and monitored under the Office of Naval Research under contract  N00014-75-C-1111  . 
SAMIll and P~M\[9\] , both of which operated in conjunction with ELI , Riesbeck's parser\[SJ , and the skimming , highly topdown , style of FRUMP\[2\] .   EL1 was a semantically driven parser which maps English language sentences into the Conceptual Dependency  \[6\] representations of their meanings , it made extensive use of the semantic properties of the words being processed  , but interacted only slightly with the rest of the understanding processes it was a part of  . it would pass off a completed Conceptual Dependency representation of each sentence to SAM or PAM which would try to incorporate it into an overall story representation  . B Oth these programs attempted to understand each sentence fully  , SAM in terms of scripts , PAM in terms of plans and goals , before going onto the next sentence . ( In\[~\]Scnank and Abels on describe scripts , plans and goals . ) SAM and PAM model the way people might read a story if they were expecting a detalied test on it  , or the way a text book might be read . ? acn program's purpose was to get out of a story every piece of informatlon possible  , fney treated each piece of every story as being equally important  , ~ nd requiring total understanding . Both of these programs are relatively fragile , requiring compiex dictionary entries for every word they might  en0ounter   , as well as extensive Knowledge of the appropriate scripts and plans  . 
FR?MP , in contrast to SAM and rAM , is a robust system whl cn attempts to extract the amount of information from a newspaper story which a person gets whenneskims rapidly  . It does this by selecting a script to represent the story and then trying to fill in the various slots which are important to understand the story  . Its purpose is simply to obtain enough information from a story to produce a meaningful summary  . FRUMP is strongly topdown , and worries about incoming information from the story only insofar ~ sithelps fill In the details of the script which it selected  . 50 wnile FRUMP is robust , simply skipping over words it doesn't Know , it does miss interesting sections of stories which are not explained by its initial selection of a script  . 
1 8P attempts to model the way people normally read a newspaper story  . Unlike SAM and PAH , it does not care if it gets every last plece of information out of a story  . Dull , mundane information is gladly ignored . 
But , In contrast with FRUMP , it does not want to miss interesting parts of stories simply because tney do not mesh with initial expectations  . It tries to create a representation which captures the important aspects of each story  , but also tries to minimize extensive , unnecessary processing which does not contrl but e to the understanding of the story  . 
Thus IFP's purpose is to decidewn at parts of a story  , if any , are interesting ( in IPP's case , that means related to terrorism ) , and incorporate the appropriate information into its memory  . The concepts used to determine what is interes ting are an extension of ideas presented by SctmnK\  [7  \ ]  . 
2. Howl ~ EOA~s
The ultimate purpose of reading a newspapers to ry is to incorporate new information into memory  . In order to do this , a number of different Kinds of Knowledge are needed  . The understander must Know the meanings of words  , llngulatic rules about now words combine into sentences  , the conventions used in writing newspaper 5g stories , and , crucially , have extensive knowledge about the " real wor ld  . "It is impossible to properly understand as tory without applying already existing knowledge about the functioning of the world  . This means the use of longterm memory cannot be f ruitfully separated from other aspects of the natural understand in ~ problem  . The mana ~ emant of all this information by an understander is a critical problem In comprehension  , since the application of all potential ly relevant Knowledge all the time  , would seriously degrade the understand in ~ process  , possibly to the point of halting Ital together  . In our model of understanding , the role played by the interests of the understander Is to allow detailed processing to occur only on the parts of the story which are Important to overall understanding  , thereby conserving processing resources . 
Central to any understand in ~ system is the type of Knowledge structure used to represent stories  . At the present time , IPP represents stories in terms of scripts similar to  , although simpler than , those used by SAM and FRUMP . Most of the co--on events In IPP's area of In terest  , terrorism , such as hi Jaokings , kidnappings , and ambushes , are reason anlyster eotyped , although not necessarily wltn all the temporal sequencing present in the scripts SAM uses  . ZPP also represents some events directly In Conceptual Dependency  . The representations in IPP consist of two types of structures  . There are the event structures themselves , generally scripts such as $ KIDNAP and SAMBUSH  , which form the backbone of the story represent at ions  , and tokens which fill the roles in the event structures  . These tokens are basically the ? tcture Producers of \  [6  \ ]  , and represent the concepts underlying words such as " airliner  , "" machine-gun " and " Kidnapper . " The final story representation can also Include links between event structures in d icating causal  , temporal and script-scene relationships . 
Due to IPP's limited repertoire of struc tures with which to represent events  , it is currently unable to fully understand some stories which maXe sense only in terms of goals and plans  , or other higher level representations . However , the understanding techniques used in IPP should be applicable to stories which require the use of such knowledge structures  . This is a topic of current research . 
It Is worth noting that the form of a story's representation may depend on the purpose behind its being read  . If the reader is only mildly Interested in the subject of the story  , soriptal representation may well be adequate  . On the other hand , for an story of great interest to the reader  , additional effort may be expended to al low the goals and plans of the actors In thes tory to be gorked out  . This Is generally more complex than simply representing a story in terms of stereotypica l knowledge  , and will only be attempted in cases of great interest  . 
In order to achieve its purpose , ~ PP does extensive " topdown " processing . That Is , It makes pred lotions a O out what it is likely to see  . These predictions range from low-level , syntactic predictions ( " the next noun phrase will be the person kidnapped  , " for instance ) to quite high-level , global predictions ,   ( " expect to see demands made by the terrorist  "   )   . Significantly , the program only makes predictions about th ings it would like to Know  . It doesn't mind skipping over unimportant parts of the text  . 
The topdown predictions made by IPP are implemented in terms of requests  , similar to those used by Ries becK\[5\] , which are basically Just test-action pairs . While such an implementation In theory allows arbitrary computations to ~ e performed  , the actions used in IPP are in fact quite limited  . IPP requests can build an event structure , link event structures together , use a token to fill a role in an events t ructure  , activate new requests or de-activate other act ive requests  . 
The tests in IPP requests are also llmited in nature  . 
They can look for certain types of events or tokens  , check for words with a specified property in their dictionary entry  , or even check for specific lexical items . The tests for lexical items are quite Important in Keeping IPP's processing eff icient  . One advantage is that very specific topdown predictions will often allow an otherwise very complex word disa ~ biguation process to be bypassed  . For example , in a story about a hijacking , ZPP expects the word " carrying " to indicate that the passengers of the hijacked vehicle are to follow  . So it never has to consider An any detail the meaning of " carrying  . " Many function words really nave no meaning by themselves  , and the type of predictive processing used by IPP is crucial in handling themeffic iently  . 
Despite its topdown orientation , IPP does not ignore unexpected Input . Rather , If the new Information is interesting in it self the program will concentrate on it  , makin ~ new predictions In addition to , or instead of , the original ones . The proper integration of topdown and bottom -upprocessing allows the program to beeffic i ent  , and yet not miss interesting , unexpected information . 
The bottom-up process in ~ of IPP is based around aulassification of words that is dones trictly on the basis of processing considerations  . IPPIs interested in the traditional syntactic classifications only when they help determine how worqs should be processed  . 
IPP's criteria for classification Involve the type of data structures words bui ld  , and when they should be processed . 
Words can build either of the main datast ructures used in XPP  , events and tokens . The words bulld in ~ events are usually verbs  , but many syntactic nouns , such as ? kidnapping , "" riot , " and " demonstration " also indicate events , and are handled in Just the same way as tradit ional verbs  . Some words , such as = o at adjectives and adverbs , do not build structures but rather modify structures built by other words  . These words are handled according to the type o fstructure they modify  . 
The second criteria for classifying words-when they should be processed-is cruc i alto  1PP's operation . In order to model a rapid , normally paced reader , IPP attempts to avoid do in ~ any processing which will not add to its overall understand in ~ of a story  . To do this , it classifies words into three groups - words which must be fully processed i--ed lately  , words which should be saved in short-ter ~ memory  , and then processed later , if ne , = essary , and words which should be skipped entirely . 
Words which must be processed immediately include interesting words building either events tructures or tokens  . " Gunmen , "" kidnapped " and " exploded " are typical examples  . These words give us the overall framework of a story  , indicate how much effort should 0e devoted to further analysis , and , most importantly , generate the predictions w ~ lohallow later processing to proceed efficiently  . 
The save and process later words are those which may becomes i ~ ni fioant later  , but are not obviously impor ~ cant when they are read  . This class is quite substantial , Including many dull nouns and nearly all ad jectives and adverbs  . Zn a noun phrase sucn as " numerous Italian gunmen  , " there Isnopoint in processing tO any depth " numerous " or " Italian " until we ~ now the word they modify is Importantenou ~ n to be included in the final representation  . Zn the cases where further procese in ~ is necessary  , IPP has the proper information to easily incorporate the saved words Into the story representation  , and In the many cases the word is required . The process in ~ strategy for these words is a Key to modei~n~nom  , alreading . 
The final class of words are those IPP skips altogether  . 
Thls class includes very unlnterest ln~words whlch neither contribute processing clues  , nor add to the story representation . Many function words , adjectives and verbs irrelevant to the domain at hand  , and most pronouns fall into this category . These words can still be significant in cases where they are pred lcted  , but otherwise they are ignored by IPP and take no process ln~ef for t  . 
In addition to the processing techniques mentioned so far  , IPP makes use of several very pragmatic heuristics  . 
These are particularly important in processlng noun ~ roups properly  . An example of the type of heuristic used is IPP's assumption that the first actor in a story tends to be important  , and is worth extra processing effort . Other heurlst ~ cs can be seen in the example In section ~  . IP~'s basic strategy is to make reasonable guesses about the appropriate representation as qulcKly as possible  , facilitating later process ln ~ and fix things later if its ~ uesses are prove to be wrong  .

The text between the rows of stars has been added to explain the operation of IPP  . Items beginning with a dollar sign , such as $ rERRORISM , indicate scripts used by IPP to represent events .

In humans this presumably occurs after a reader has noted that stories involving gunment end to be interesting  . Since it is interesting , IPP fully processes GUNMEN , Knowing that it Is important to its purpose of extracting the significant content of the story  , it builds a token to represent the GUNMEN and makes several predlct lons to facilitate later processing  . There is a strong possibility that some verb conceptually equivalent to " shoot " will appear  . 
There are also a set of scripts , including SROBBERY , STER RORISM and $ HIJACK wnlcn are likely to appear  , so IPP creates predictions looking for clues indicating that one of these scriptss O ould be activated and used to represent the story  .

Notice that tneprediction immediately dl samblguates FIRING  . Other senses of the word , such as " terminate employment " are never considered  .

Notice that 1PP has jumped to a conclusion about the story , , which , while plausible , could easily be wrong , it assumes that the actor of the SBOMB and SATTACK-PLACE scripts is the same as the actor of the STERRORISM script  , which was in turn inferred from the actor of the sbootln ~ incident  . Tn ls is plausible , as normally news stories are about a coherent set of events witn lo~Ical relations amongst them  . So it is reasonable for a story to Deabouta series of related acts of terrorism  , committed by the same person or ~ roup , and tnatis what IPP assumes here even though that may not be correct  . Uut this ~ Ind of inference is exactly the Kind which IPP must make in order to do efficient topdown process ln ~  , despite the possibility of errors . 
The otner interesting point about tn is example is the way some of iPP's quite pragmatic heuristics for process ln~give positive results  . For instance , as mentioned earlier , the first actor mentioned has a stronz tendency to be important to the understand ln ~ of a story  . In thls story that means that the modlfy in ~ prepositional phrase " of former President Su ~ enlo Kjell Lau ~ erud " is analyzed and attached to the token built for " son  , " usually not an interesting word . Heur ~ stlcs of this sort ~ ive IPP its power and robustness  , rather than any single rule about language understand ln ~  . 
5. CONCLUSION
IPP has been implemented on a DEC system 20/50 at Yale . 
It currently has a vocabulary of more than I~00 words wnlcn is oelng continually Increased in an attempt to make the program an expert underst~der of newspaper storiess coutterrorism  . ? t is also planned to add information about nigher level knowledge structures such as ~ oals and plans and expand IPP's domain of interest  . 
To date , IPP has successfully processed over 50 stories taken directly from various newspapers , many sight unseen . 
The difference between the powers of IPP and the syntactl cally driven parsers mentioned earller cancent be seen by the Kinds of sentences they handle  . 
S yntax-0ased parsers generally deal with relatively s imple  , syntactically well-formed sentences . IPP handles sucn sentences , Out also accurately processes stories taken directly from newspapers  , which often involve extremely convoluted syntax  , and in many cases are not grammatical at all . Sentences of this type are difficult , if not impossible for parsers rely ln ~ on syntax . IPP is sole to process news stories quickly , on the order of 2CPU seconds , and when done , it has achieved a complete understand ln ~ of the story  , not Just a syntactic parse . 
As shown in tne examples above , interest can provide a purpose for reading newspaper stories  . In other situations , other factors might provide the purpose . 
But the purpose is never simply to create a representation-especially a representation with no semantic content  , such as a syntax tree . This is not to say syntax is not important , obviously in many circumstances it provides crucial information  , but it should not drive the understanding process  . Preliminary representations are needed only if they assist in the reader'sultimate purpose bull dln ~ an appropriate  , high-level representation which can be incorporated with already existing Knowledge  . The results achieved by IPP indicate that parsing directly into high-level knowledge structures is possible  , and in many situations may well be more practical than first do in ~ a low-level parse  . 
Its integrated approacn allows IPP to make use of all the various kinds of knowledge which people use when understand tn~a story  .
