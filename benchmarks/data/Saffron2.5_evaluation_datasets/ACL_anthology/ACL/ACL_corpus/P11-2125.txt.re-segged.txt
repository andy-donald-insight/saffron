Abstract
We combine multiple word representations based on semantic clusters extracted from the ( Brown et al , 1992) algorithm and syntactic clusters obtained from the Berkeley parser ( Petrov et al , 2006) in order to improve discriminative dependency parsing in the MSTParser framework ( McDonald et al , 2005).
We also provide an ensemble method for combining diverse cluster-based models . The two contributions together significantly improves unlabeled dependency accuracy from 90.82% to 92.13%.
1 Introduction
A simple method for using unlabeled data in discriminative dependency parsing was provided in ( Koo et al , 2008) which involved clustering the labeled and unlabeled data and then each word in the dependency treebank was assigned a cluster identifier . These identifiers were used to augment the feature representation of the edge-factored or second-order features , and this extended feature set was used to discriminatively train a dependency parser.
The use of clusters leads to the question of how to integrate various types of clusters ( possibly from different clustering algorithms ) in discriminative dependency parsing . Clusters obtained from the ( Brown et al , 1992) clustering algorithm are typically viewed as ? semantic ?, e.g . one cluster might contain plan , letter , request , memo , . . . while another may contain people , customers , employees , students , . . .. Another clustering view that is more ? syntactic ? in nature comes from the use of state-splitting in PCFGs . For instance , we could extract a syntactic cluster loss , time , profit , earnings , performance , rating , . . .: all head words of noun phrases corresponding to cluster of direct objects of verbs like improve . In this paper , we obtain syntactic clusters from the Berkeley parser ( Petrov et al ., 2006). This paper makes two contributions : 1) We combine together multiple word representations based on semantic and syntactic clusters in order to improve discriminative dependency parsing in the MSTParser framework ( McDonald et al , 2005), and 2) We provide an ensemble method for combining diverse clustering algorithms that is the discriminative parsing analog to the generative product of experts model for parsing described in ( Petrov , 2010).
These two contributions combined significantly improves unlabeled dependency accuracy : 90.82% to 92.13% on Sec . 23 of the Penn Treebank , and we see consistent improvements across all our test sets.
2 Dependency Parsing
A dependency tree represents the syntactic structure of a sentence with a directed graph ( Figure 1), where nodes correspond to the words , and arcs indicate head-modifier pairs ( Mel?c?uk , 1987). Graphbased dependency parsing searches for the highest-scoring tree according to a part-factored scoring function . In the first-order parsing models , the parts are individual head-modifier arcs in the dependency tree ( McDonald et al , 2005). In the higher-order models , the parts consist of arcs together with some context , e.g.
the parent or the sister arcs ( McDonald and Pereira , 2006; Carreras , 2007; Koo and Collins , 2010). With a linear scoring function , the parse for a sentence s is:
PARSE(s ) = arg max t?T ( s ) ? r?t w ? f(s , r ) (1) where T ( s ) is the space of dependency trees for s , and f(s , r ) is the feature vector for the part r which is linearly combined using the model parameter w to give the part score . The above argmax search for nonprojective dependency parsing is accom-

plished using minimum spanning tree algorithms ( West , 2001) or approximate inference algorithms ( Smith and Eisner , 2008; Koo et al , 2010). The ( Eisner , 1996) algorithm is typically used for projective parsing . The model parameters are trained using a discriminative learning algorithm , e.g . averaged perceptron ( Collins , 2002) or MIRA ( Crammer and Singer , 2003). In this paper , we work with both first-order and second-order models , we train the models using MIRA , and we use the ( Eisner , 1996) algorithm for inference.
The baseline features capture information about the lexical items and their part of speech ( POS ) tags ( as defined in ( McDonald et al , 2005)). In this work , following ( Koo et al , 2008), we use word cluster identifiers as the source of an additional set of features . The reader is directed to ( Koo et al , 2008) for the list of cluster-based feature templates . The clusters inject long distance syntactic or semantic information into the model ( in contrast with the use of POS tags in the baseline ) and help alleviate the sparse data problem for complex features that include ngrams.
3 The Ensemble Model
A word can have different syntactic or semantic cluster representations , each of which may lead to a different parsing model . We use ensemble learning ( Dietterich , 2002) in order to combine a collection of diverse and accurate models into a more powerful model . In this paper , we construct the base models based on different syntactic/semantic clusters used in the features in each model . Our ensemble parsing model is a linear combination of the base models:
PARSE(s ) = arg max t?T ( s ) ? k ? k ? r?t wk ? fk(s , r ) (2) where ? k is the weight of the kth base model , and each base model has its own feature mapping fk (.) based on its cluster annotation . Each expert parsing model in the ensemble contains all of the baseline and the cluster-based feature templates ; therefore , the experts have in common ( at least ) the baseline features . The only difference between individual parsing models is the assigned cluster labels , and hence some of the cluster-based features . In a future work , we plan to take the union of all of the feature sets and train a joint discriminative parsing model . The ensemble approach seems more scalable though , since we can incrementally add a large number of clustering algorithms into the ensemble.
4 Syntactic and Semantic Clustering
In our ensemble model we use three different clustering methods to obtain three types of word representations that can help alleviate sparse data in a dependency parser . Our first word representation is exactly the same as the one used in ( Koo et al , 2008) where words are clustered using the Brown algorithm ( Brown et al , 1992). Our two other clusterings are extracted from the split nonterminals obtained from the PCFG-based Berkeley parser ( Petrov et al , 2006). Split nonterminals from the Berkeley parser output are converted into cluster identifiers in two different ways : 1) the split POS tags for each word are used as an alternate word representation . We call this representation Syn-Low , and 2) head percolation rules are used to label each nonterminal in the parse such that each nonterminal has a unique daughter labeled as head . Each word is assigned a cluster identifier which is defined as the parent split nonterminal of that word if it is not marked as head , else if the parent is marked as head we recursively check its parent until we reach the unique split nonterminal that is not marked as head . This recursion terminates at the start symbol TOP . We call this representation Syn-High . We only use cluster identifiers from the Berkeley parser , rather than dependencies , or any other information.

5 Experimental Results
The experiments were done on the English Penn Treebank , using standard head-percolation rules ( Yamada and Matsumoto , 2003) to convert the phrase structure into dependency trees .

opment set ( Section 22), and test sets ( Sections 0, 1, 23, and 24). All our experimental settings match previous work ( Yamada and Matsumoto , 2003; McDonald et al , 2005; Koo et al , 2008). POS tags for the development and test data were assigned by MXPOST ( Ratnaparkhi , 1996), where the tagger was trained on the entire training corpus . To generate part of speech tags for the training data , we used 20-way jackknifing , i.e . we tagged each fold with the tagger trained on the other 19 folds . We set model weights ? k in Eqn (2) to one for all experiments.
Syntactic State-Splitting The sentence-specific word clusters are derived from the parse trees using parse trees with split syntactic categories . To generate parse trees for development and test data , the parser is trained on the entire training data to learn a PCFG with latent annotations using split-merge operations for 5 iterations . To generate parse trees for the training data , we used 20-way jackknifing as with the tagger.
Word Clusterings from Brown Algorithm The word clusters were derived using Percy Liang?s implementation of the ( Brown et al , 1992) algorithm on the BLLIP corpus ( Charniak et al , 2000) which contains ?43M words of Wall Street Journal text.2 This produces a hierarchical clustering over the words which is then sliced at a certain height to obtain the clusters . In our experiments we use the clusters obtained in ( Koo et al , 2008)3, but were unable to match the accuracy reported there , perhaps due to additional features used in their implementation not described in the paper.4 Results Table 1 presents our results for each model on each test set . In this table , the baseline ( first column ) does not use any cluster-based features , the next three models use cluster-based features using different clustering algorithms , and the last column is our ensemble model which is the linear combination of the three cluster-based models.
As Table 1 shows , the ensemble model has outperformed the baseline and individual models in almost all cases . Among the individual models , the model with Brown semantic clusters clearly outperforms the baseline , but the two models with syntactic clusters perform almost the same as the baseline.
The ensemble model outperforms all of the individual models and does so very consistently across both first-order and second-order dependency models.
Error Analysis To better understand the contribution of each model to the ensemble , we take a closer look at the parsing errors for each model and the ensemble . For each dependent to head depen-1code.google.com/p/berkeleyparser 2Sentences of the Penn Treebank were excluded from the text used for the clustering.

dency , Fig . 2(a ) shows the error rate for each dependent grouped by a coarse POS tag ( c.f . ( McDonald and Nivre , 2007)). For most POS categories , the Brown cluster model is the best individual model , but for Adjectives it is Syn-High , and for Pronouns it is Syn-Low that is the best . But the ensemble always does the best in every grammatical category.
Fig . 2(b ) shows the Fscore of the different models for various dependency lengths , where the length of a dependency from word wi to word wj is equal to | i ? j |. We see that different models are experts on different lengths ( Syn-Low on 8, Syn-High on 9), while the ensemble model can always combine their expertise and do better at each length.
6 Comparison to Related Work
Several ensemble models have been proposed for dependency parsing ( Sagae and Lavie , 2006; Hall et al ., 2007; Nivre and McDonald , 2008; Attardi and Dell?Orletta , 2009; Surdeanu and Manning , 2010).
Essentially , all of these approaches combine different dependency parsing systems , i.e . transition-based and graphbased . Although graphbased models are globally trained and can use exact inference algorithms , their features are defined over a limited history of parsing decisions . Since transition-based parsing models have the opposite characteristics , the idea is to combine these two types of models to exploit their complementary strengths.
The base parsing models are either independently trained ( Sagae and Lavie , 2006; Hall et al , 2007; Attardi and Dell?Orletta , 2009; Surdeanu and Manning , 2010), or their training is integrated , e.g . using stacking ( Nivre and McDonald , 2008; Attardi and Dell?Orletta , 2009; Surdeanu and Manning , 2010).
Our work is distinguished from the aforementioned works in two dimensions . Firstly , we combine various graphbased models , constructed using different syntactic/semantic clusters . Secondly , we do exact inference on the shared hypothesis space of the base models . This is in contrast to previous work which combine the best parse trees suggested by the individual base-models to generate a final parse tree , i.e . a two-phase inference scheme.
7 Conclusion
We presented an ensemble of different dependency parsing models , each model corresponding to a dif-tion . The ensemble obtains consistent improvements in unlabeled dependency parsing , e.g . from 90.82% to 92.13% for Sec . 23 of the Penn Treebank . Our error analysis has revealed that each syn-tactic/semantic parsing model is an expert in capturing different dependency lengths , and the ensemble model can always combine their expertise and do better at each dependency length . We can incrementally add a large number models using different clustering algorithms , and our preliminary results show increased improvement in accuracy when more models are added into the ensemble.
