Informally , a disposition is a proposition which is prepon -derantly  , but no necessarily always , true . For example , birds canfly is a disposition , as are the propositions S we des are blond and Spaniards are dark  . 
An idea which underlies the theory described in this paper is that a disposition may be viewed as a proposition with implicit fuzzy quantifiers which are approximations to all and always  , e . g . , almost all , almost always , most , frequently , etc . For example , birds canfly may be interpreted as the result of supressing the fuzzy quantifier most in the proposition most birds can fly  . Similarly , young men like young women may be read as most young men like mostly young women  . The process of transforming a disposition into a proposition is referred to a sezplicitation or restoration  . 
Explicitation sets the stage for representing the meaning of a proposition through the use of test -score semantics  ( Zadeh ,  1978 ,  1982) . In this approach to semantics , the meaning of a proposition , p , is represented as a procedure which tests , scores and aggregates the elastic constraints which are induced by p  . 
The paper closes with a description of an approach to reasoning with dispositions which is based on the concept of a fuzzy syllogism  . Syllogistic reasoning with dispositions has an important bearing on common sense reasoning as well as on the management of uncertainty in expert systems  . As a simple application of the techniques described in this paper  , we formulate a definition of typicality-a concept which plays an important role in human cognition and is of relevance to default reasoning  . 
1. Introduction
Informally , a disposition is a proposition which is prepon -derantly  , but not necessarily always , true . Simple examples of dispositions are : Smoking is addictive  , exercise is good for your health , long sentences are more difficult to parse than short sentences  , overeating cause so be sity , Trudi is always right , etc . 
Dispositions play a central role in human reasoning  , since much of human knowledge and , especially , commous ense knowledge , may be viewed as a collection of dispositions . 
The concept of a disposition gives rise to a number of related concepts among which is the concept of a dispositional predicate  . Familiar examples of unary predicates of this type are : Healthy  , honest , optimist , safe , etc . , with binary disposi-tional predicates exemplified by : taller than in Swedes are taller than Frenchmen  , like in Italians are like Spaniards , like in youn 9 men like young women , and smokes in Ronsmokes cigarettes . Another related concept is that of a dispositional command or imperative  ) which is exemplified by proceed with caution , avoid overexertion , keep under refrigeration , be frank , etc .

The basic idea underlying the approach described in this paper is that a disposition may be viewed as a proposition with suppressed  , or , more generally , implicit fuzzy quantifiers such as most ~ almost all  , almost always , usually , rarely , much of the time , etc . To illustrate , the disposition gestating cause so be sity may be viewed as the result of suppression of the fuzzy quantifier most in the proposition most of those who overeat are obese  . Similarly , the disposition young men like young women may be interpreted as most young men like mostly young women  . It should be stressed , however , that restoration ( or ezplicitation ) --viewed as the inverse of suppression - is an interpretation-dependent process in the sense that  , in general , a disposition may be interpreted in different ways depending on the manner in which the fuzzy quantifiers are restored and defined  . 
The implicit presence of fuzzy quantifier stands in the way of representing the meaning of dispositional concepts through the use of conventional methods based on truth conditional  , possible-world or model theoretic semantics ( Cress well , 1973; McCawley , 1981; Miller and Johnson-Laird ,  1970) , ~- tn the computational pproach which is described in this paper  , a fuzzy quantifier is manipulated as a fuzzy number  . This idea serves two purposes . First , it provides a basis for representing the meaning of dispositions  ; and second , it opens a way of reasoning with dispositions through the use of a collection of syllogisms  . This aspect of the concept of a disposition is of relevance to default reasoning and nonmonotonic logic  ( McCarthy , 1980; McDermott and Doyle , 1980; McDermott , 1982; Reiter ,  1983) . 
To illustrate the manner in which fuzzy quantifiers may be manipulated as fuzzy numbers  , assume that , after restoration , two dispositions dI and d 2 may be expressed as propositions of the form
PlAQtAts are BIs (1.1)
P2A = Q2Bes are CIs , (1 . 2) in which Ql and Q2 are fuzzy quantifiers , and A , B and C are fuzzy predicates . For example , Pl&-most students are undergraduates (1 . 3)
P2~most undergraduates are young.
By treating Pl and P2 as the major and minor premises in a syllogism , the following chaining syllogism may be established if BCA  ( Zadeh ,  1983): 1 . In the literature of linguistics , logic and philosophy of languages , fuz-zyquantifiers are usually referred to as ~ agne or generalized quantifiers  ( Barwise and Cooper , 1981; Peterson ,  1979) . In the approach described in this paper , a fuszy quantifier is interpreted as a fuzzy number which provides an approximate characterization of absolute or relative cardinality  . 

Q1A'soreBts (1.4)
Q:BIs are CIs >_ ( QI ~ Q2 ) A  #s are C's in which Q1  ~  Q2 represents the product of the fuzzy numbers QI and  Q2   ( Figure 1 )  . 

Proportion and ~_ ( Ql ~ Q:t ) should be read as " at least Q1 ~ Q2 . " As shown in Figure 1 , Q ~ and Q2 are defined by their respective possibility distributions  , which means that if the value of Q1 at the point u is a , then are presents the possibility that the proportion of A~s in B~s is u  . 
In the special case where Pl and P2 are expressed by ( 1 . 3) , the chaining syllogism yields most students are undergraduates most nnder qradnates are voun q most  2 students are young where most ~ represents the product of the fuzzy number most with itself  ( Figure 2 )  .

2 . Meaning Representation and Test-Score Semantics To represent the meaning of a disposition  , d , ~? e employ a two stage process . First , the suppressed fuzzy quantifiers in d are restored  , resulting in a fuzzily quantified proposition p . 
Then , the meaning of p is represented -- through the use of test-score semantics  ( Zadeh ,  1978 ,  1982 ) - as a procedure which acts on a collection of relations in an explanatory database and returns a test score which represents the degree of compatibility of p with the database  . In effect , this implies that p may be viewed as a collection of elastic constraints which are tested  , scored and aggregated by the meaning -representation procedure  . In test-score semantics , these elastic constraints play a role which is analogous to that truth-conditions in truth conditional semantics  ( Cress well ,  1973) . 
As a simple illustration , consider the familiar exampled As now is white which we interpret as a disposition whose intended meaning is the proposition pA usually snow is white  . 
To represent the meaning of p , we assume that the ezplana-tory database , EDF ( Zadeh ,  1982) , consists of the following relations whose meaning is presumed to be known EDFAWHITE\[Sample  ; p\]+USUALLY\[Proportion ; p\] , in which + should be read as and . The ith row in WHITE is a tuple ( Si , ri ), i = 1, . . . , m , in which Si is the ith sample of snow , and ri is is the degree to which the color of Si matches white  . Thus , ri may be interpreted as the test score for the constraint on the color of Si induced by the elastic constraint WHITE  . Similarly , the relation USUALLY may be interpreted as an elastic constraint on the variable Proportion  , with prepresenting the test score associated with a numerical value of Proportion  . 
The steps in the procedure which represents the meaning of p may be described as follows:  1  . Find the proportion of samples whose color is white : rl-k ? ??- brmmin which the proportion is expressed as the arithmetic average of the test scores  . 
2 . Compute the degree to which ? satisfies the constraint induced by USUALLY : r~~USUALLY\ [ Proportion ~ p \]  , in which r is the overall test score , i . e . , the degree of compatibility of p with ED , and the notation ~ R\[X = a \] means : Set the variable X in the relation R equal to a and read the value of the variable p  . 
More generally , to represent the meaning of a disposition it is necessary to define the cardinality of a fuzzy set  . 
Specifically , if A is a subset of a finite universe of discourse U----ul  ,  . . . , u , , then the sigma-count of A is defined as ~ Count ( A ) = I : ~ pA ( U  ~ )  ,  (2 . 1) in which pA(Ui ), i----l, . . . , n , is the grade of membership of u/inA(Zadeh , 1983a ) , and it is understood that the summay be rounded , if need be , to the nearest integer . Furthermore , one may stipulate that the terms whose grade of membership falls below a specified threshold be excluded from the summation  . 
The purpose of such an exclusion is to avoid a situation in which a large number of terms with low grades of membership become count-equivalent to a small number of terms with high membership  . 
The relative sigma-count , denoted by ~ Count ( B/A ) , may be interpreted as the proportion of elements of B in A  . More explicitly , ~Count(B/A)--~~Count(AflB ) (2 . 2)
ECount(a ) ' where BDA , the intersection of B and A , is defined by where A denotes the sin operator in infix form  . Thus , in terms of the membership functions of B and A , the relative slgma-count of B and A is given by ~ , #B(u , ) At in ( u , ) ZCount(B/A = (2 . 3 ~ , tJa(u , ) As an illustration , consider the disposition dA overating causes obesity  ( 2 . 4 ) which after restoration is assumed to read 2 pA most of those who overeat are obese .  (2 . 5) To represent the meaning of p , we shall employ an expla-natory database whose constituent relations are : EDF~-POPULATION\ [ Nome  ; Overeat ; Obese\]+MOST ( Proportion ; it \] . 
The relation POPULATION is a list of names of individuals  , with the variables Overeat and Obese representing  , respectively , the degrees to which Name over eats and is obese . In MOST , p is the degree to which a numerical value of Propor-tionfits the intended meaning of MOST  . 
To test procedure which represents the meaning of p involves the following steps  . 
1 . Let Name ~, i--1 . . . . . m , be the name of ith individual in POPULATION . For each Name , find the degrees to which Namei over eats and is obese:ai APOVEREAr  ( Namei ) A0 . . . . . tPOPULAT/ON(Name=Namei\]# , AIton EsE(Namei~o6 , , POPULA TlON\[Name ~ Namei \] . 
2. Compute the relative sigma-count of OBESE in
OVEREAT := iaiA  #ip@~Count ( OBESE/OVEREAT ) =
E , ai3 . Compute the test score for the constraint induced by MOST : r-~~MOST\[Proportion--~p\]  . 
This test score represents the compatibility of p with the explanatory database  . 
3. The Scope of a Fuzzy Quantifier
In dealing with the conventional quantifiers all and some inflint-order logic  , the scope of a quantifier plays an essential role in defining its meaning  . In the case of a fuzzy quantifier which is characterized by a relative sigma-count  , what matters is the identity of the sets which enter into the relative count  . 
Thus , if the sigma-count is of the form EC ount ( B/A )  , which should be read as the proportion of BIs in AIs  , then B and A will be referred to as then-set\[ with n standing for numerator  ) and b-set ( with b standing for base )  , respectively . The ordered pairn-set , b-set , then , may be viewed a ~ a generalization of the concept of the scope of a quantifier  . Note , however , that , in this sense , the scope of a fuzzy quantifier is a semantic rather than syntactic oncept  . 
As a simple illustration , consider the proposition pA most students are undergraduates  . In this case , then-set of most is undergraduates , the b-set is students , and the scope of most is the pair undergraduates  , tudents . 
2 . It should be understood that (2 . 5) is just one of many possible in-terpret ~ . tions f(2 . 4) , with no implicat ; on that is constitutes a prescriptive interpretation fcausality  . See Suppes (1970 . 
As an additional illustration of the interaction between scope and meaning  , consider the disposition dA young men like young women  .  (3 . 1 ) Among the possible interpretations of this disposition  , we shall focus our attention on the following ( the symbol rd denotes a restoration of a disposition  ) : rdIA most young men like most young women rd 2 A most young men like mostly oung women . 
To place in evidence the difference between rdI and rdz  , it is expedient to express them in the form rdl- ~- most young menPIrd  2 ~most young men P2   , where Pl and P2 are the fuzzy predicates
PlA likes most young women and
P2A likes mostly young women , with the understanding that , for grammatical correctness , likes in PI and P2 should be replaced by llke when Pl and P2 act as constituents of rdI and rd 2  . In more explicit terms,
PI and P2 may be expressed as
PIAP,\[Name;p\](3.2)
P2~-P2\[Name;p\] , in which Name is the name of a male person and # is the degree to which the person in question satisfies the predicate  . 
\[Equivalently , p is the grade of membership of the person in the fuzzy set which represents the denotation or  , equivalently , the extension of the predicate . ) To represent the meaning of PI and P2 through the use of test-score semantics , we assume that the explanatory database consists of the following relations  ( gade h , 1983b):
EDFAPOPULATION(Name;Age;Sex\]+
LlKE\[Namel;Name2;p\]+YOUNG(Age;p\]+
MOST ( Proportion ; It\].
In LIKE , it is the degree to which Namel likes Name 9 ; and in YOUNG , it is the degree to which a person whose age is
Age is young.
First , we shall represent the meaning of PI by the following test procedure  . 
1 . Divide POPULATION into the population of males , M . POPULATION , and the population of females,
F . POPULATION :
M . POPULATIONAN .   .   .   . Ag , POPULATION\[Sez---Male\]F . POPULATONAN e , , , ,age POPULA TION\[Sez---Female \] , where N~mc , AocPOPULATION denotes the projection of POPULAT ION on the attributes Name and 

2 . For each Name : , j ~ 1 . . . . . L , in F . POPULATION , find the age of Namei : Ai AAge F . POPULATION\[Name ~ Namei\] . 
3 . For each Name i , find the degree to which Name i is young : aiA ~ YOUNG\[Ag e = Ai\]  , where ai may be interpreted as the grade of young women  . 
4 . For each Name i , i = l, .   .   . , K , in M . POPULATION , find the age of Namei : BiAAge M . POPULAT lON\[Name---Namei\] . 
5 . For each Name i , find the degree to which Namei likes Namei : ~ ii ~- ~ LIKE\[Namel = Namel  ; Name 2=Namei\] , with the understanding that ~ i/may be interpreted as the grade of membership of Namei in the fuzzy set  , WLi , of women whom Name , likes . 
6 . For each Name/find the degree to which Name , likes Namei and Namei is young : " TiiAaiA # ii ? Note : As in previous examples  , we employ the aggregation operator a in ( A ) to represent the meaning of conjunction . In effect ,   70 is the grade of membership of Namei in the intersection of the fuzzy sets WLI and YW  . 
7. Compute the relative sigma-count of women whom
Namei likes among young women:
PiA ~ CounttWLi/YW ) (3.4)
ECount(WLiNYW)~Count(YW)_~i76 ai
F . iai8 . Compute the test score for the constraint induced by MOST : ri=~MOST\[Proportion----Pi\]  ( 3 . 5 ) This test-score way be interpreted as the degree to which Name is a tisfies PI  , i . e . , ri = p PI \[ Name = Namei \] The test procedure described above represents the meaning of P  ,  . In effect , it tests the constraint expressed by the proposition 
E Count ( YW/WLi ) is MOST and implies that then-set and the b-set for the quantifier most in PI are given by : n -set = WLi = N  . , . , 2LIKE\[Name1--~Namei\]flF . POPULATION and b-set=YW = YOUNG flF . POPULATION . 
By contrast , in the case of P2 , the identities of the n-set and the b-set are interchanged  , i . e . , n-set = YW and b-set = WL i , which implies that the constraint which defines P2 is expressed by
ECount(YW\[WLi ) is MOST.



Thus , whereas the scope of the quantifier most in PI is WLi  , YW , the scope of mostly in P2 is YW , WL  ~ . 
Having represented the meaning of P1 and P ~ , it becomes a simple matter to represent the meaning of rd  , and rd ~ . Taking rdD for example , we have to add the following steps to the test procedure which defines Pr For each Name i  , find the degree to which Name i is young : 6i AuYOUNG\[Age=Bi \] , where/fi may be interpreted as the grade of membership of Namei in the fuzzy set  , YM , of young men . 
Compute the relative sigma-count of men who have property P*among young men :  6 &--~ Count ( Pl/YM ) ~ Count ( PiflYM ) 
Count(YM)~iriA$i ~ i ~ i
Test the constraint induced by MOST : r = ~ MOST\ [ Proportion=--p\]  . 
The test score expressed by (3 . 6 ) represents the overall test score for the disposition dA young men like young women if d is interpreted as rd  1  . If disinterpreted as rd2 , which is a more likely interpretation , then the procedure is unchanged except hat ri in  ( 3 . 5 ) should here placed by ri = ~ MOST\[Proportion - ~ -   6i \] where 6  , A ~ Count(YW/WL ,  ) 4 . Representation of Dhspost lonal Commands and

The approach described in the preceding sections can be applied not only to the representation f the meaning of dispo-sitions and dispositional predicates  , but , more generally , to various types of semantic entities as well as dispositional concepts  . 
As an illustration of its application to the representation of the meaning of dispositional commands  , consider dcAs tay away from bald men ,  (4 . 1 ) whose explicit representation will be assumed to be the com-m and cA stay away from most bald men  .  (4 . 2 ) The meaning of c is defined by its compliance criterion  ( gade h , 1982) or , equivalently , its propositional content ( Searle ,  1979) , which may be expressed a see A staying away from most bald men  . 
To represent the meaning ofce through the use of test-score semantics  , we shall employ the explanatory database+MOST\ [ Proposition  ;  #\]  . 
The relation RECORD may be interpreted as a diary --kept during the period of interest--in which Name is the name of a man  ; pB ald is the degree to which he is bald ; and Action describes whether them an in question was stayed away from  ( Action ~ l ) or not ( Action = 0 )  . 
The test procedure which defines the meaning of dc may be described as follows:  1  . For each Namei , i ~ I . . . . . n , find ( a ) the degree to which Namel is bald ; and ( b ) the action taken :  #BaldiA , B ~ IdRECORD\[Name-- . Namei\]ActioniAa ~ tionRECORO\[Name-- . Namei \] . 
2 . Compute the relative sigma-count of compliance : 1 \[~ ipBaldlAActi?ni " ( 4 . 3) p = --#3 . Test the constraint induced by MOST : r = ~ MOST\ [ Propo Mtion = p\]?  ( 4 . 4) The computed test score expressed by (4 . 4) represents the degree of compliance with c , while the procedure which leads tor represents the meaning of de  . 
The concept of dispositionality applies not only to semantic entities such as propositions  , predicates , commands , etc . , but , more generally , to concepts and their definitions . As an illustration , we shall consider the concept of typicality--a concept which plays a basic role in human reasoning  , especially in default reasoning ' ( Reiter ,  1983) , concept formation ( Smith and Media ,  1981) , and pattern recognition ( Zadeh ,  1977 . 
Let U be a universe of discourse and let Abea fuzzy set in A  ( e . g . , UA cars and A~station wag on s) . The definition of a typical element of A may be expressed in verbal terms as follows : t is a typical element of A if and only if  ( 4 . 5) ( a ) t has a high grade of membership in A , and ( b ) most dements of , 4 are similar to t . 
it should be remarked that this definition should be viewed as a dispositional definition  , that is , as a definition which may fail , in some cases , to reflect our intuitive perception of the meaning of typicality  . 
To put the verbal definition expressed by (4 . 5) into a more precise form , we can employ test-score semantics to represent the meaning of  ( a ) and ( h )  . Specifically , let S be a similarity relation defined on U which associates wi~h each element u in U the degree to which u is similar to t ~  . Furthermore , let S(t ) be the Mmilarity clas ~ of t , i . e . , the fuzzy set of elements of U which are similar to t  . ~ V hat this means is that the grade of membership of u in S  ( t ) is equal to  #s ( t , u ) , the degree to which u is similar to t(Zadeh ,  1971) . 
Let HIGH denote the fuzzy subset of the unit interval which is the extension of the fuzzy predicate high  . Then , the verbal definition (4 . 5 ) may be expressed more precisely in the form : t is a typical element of A if and only if  ( 4 . 6) 3 . For consistency with the definition of A , S must be such that if u and uI have a high degree of similarity  , then their grades of membership in A should be close in magnitude  . 
( a ) Pa ( t ) is HIGH ( b ) E Count ( S ( t ) /A ) is MOST . 
The fuzzy predicate high may be characterized by its membership function PHtCHor  , equivalently , as the fuzzy rein-ton IIIG fI\[Grade ; PL in which Grade is a number in the interval \ [0 , 1\] and p . is the degree to which the value of Gradefits the intended meaning of high  . 
An important implication of this definition is that typi-cality is a matter of degree  . Thus , it follows at once from (4 . 6) that the degree , r , to which t is typical or , equivalently , the grade of membership of t in the fuzzy set of typical elements of A  , is given by r = tHIGH\[Grade=t\]A (4 . 7) a MOST\[Proportion = ~, Count(S(t)/A\] . 
In terms of the membe ~ hip functions of HIGH , MOST , S and A ,  (4 . 7 may be written as \[ ~ , Pstt , u ) APA(u ) Ir AV . -LF . J ' (4 . 8) where tHIGH , PMOSr , PS and PA are the membership functions of HIGH , MOST , S and A , respectively , and the summation
Zu extends over the elements of U.
It is of interesto observe that if pa ( t ) -----1 and . s(t,n ) = ~ a(u ), (4 . 9) that is , the grade of membership of u in A is equal to the degree of similarity of u to t  , then the degree of typicality of t is unity . This is reminiscent of definitions of prototypicality  ( Rosch ,  1978 ) in which the grade of membership of an object in a category is assumed to be inversely related to its " distance " from the prototype  . 
In a definition of prototypicality which we gave in gade h  ( 1982 )  , a prototype is interpreted as a socalled a -summary  . 
In relation to the definition of typicality expressed by  ( 4 . 5) , we may say that a prototype is a a-summary of typical elements of A  . In this sense , a prototype is not , in general , an element of U whereas a typical element of A is  , by definition , ancle-ment of U . As a simple illustration of this difference , assume that U is a collection of movies , and A is the fuzzy set of Western movies . A prototype of A is a summary of the summaries i . e . , plots ) of Western movies , and thus is not a movie . 
A typical Western movie , on the other hand , is a movie and thus is an element of U . 
5. Fuzzy Syllogisms
A concept which plays an essential role in reasoning with dispositions is that of a fuzzy syllogism  ( Zadeh , 1983c ) . As a general inference schema , a fuzzy syllogism may be expressed in the form
QIA ' a are B in (5.1)
Q 2   CI8 are DIsfQsE'a are F ~ awhere Ql and Q2 are given fuzzy quantifiers , Q3 is fuzzy quantifier which is to be determined , and A ,  /3 , C , D , E and F are interrelated fuzzy predicates . 
In what follows , we shall present a brief discussion of two basic types of fuzzy syllogisms  . A more detailed description of these and other fuzzy syllogisms may be found in Zadeh  ( 1983 c ,  1984) . 
The intersection ~ product syllogism may be viewed as an instance of  ( 5 . 1) in which

FAB and D , and Qa = Q1 ~ Q2, i . e - , Qa is the product of QI and Q2in fuzzy arithmetic . Thus , we have as the statement of the syllo-gism :
Q1A's are B's (5.2)
QT ( A and B ) 's arc CIs ( Q1 ( ~ Q2 ) AIs are ( B and C ) ls ? In particular , if B is contained in A , i . e . , PB --< PA , where PA and P8 are the membership functions of A and B , respectively , then A and B = B , and (5 . 2) becomes
Q1A's are Bes (5.3)
Q~B's arc CIs ( QI ~ Q2 ) A's are ( B and C ) ' s . 
Since B and C implies C , it follows at once from (5 . 3) that
Q1 AIs arc BIs (5.4)
Q2BIs are C's > ( QI~Q2)A's arcC's , which is the chaining syllog is m expressed by (1 . 4) . Furthermore , if the quantifiers Q\] and Q2 are monotonic , i . e . ,>- QI--Q1 and _>Q2 = Q2, then (5 . 4) becomes the product syllogism
QIAes are B's (5.5)
Q~BIs are CIs ( QI ~ Q2 ) A'so reC's the case of the consequent conjunction syllogism  , we \] n have


F = B and D .
In this ease , the statement of syllogism is:
QIA's are B's (5.0)
Q:Afs are CIs
QaAes are ( B and C ) Is where Q is a fuzzy number ( or interval ) defined by the ine-qualities 0~ ( Q1 ? Q201 ) _ ~ Q_~QI ~ ) Q2 ,  (5 . 7) where ( ~ , ~~ and @ are the operations of addition , subtraction , rain and maxin fuzzy arithmetic . 
As a simple illustration , consider the dispositions dl A students are young d  2 ~-- students are single . 
Upon restoration , these dispositions become the propositions
PlA most students are young
P2A most students are single
Then , applying the consequent conjunction syllogism to Pl and 
P2, we can infer that
Q students are single and young where 2 most 01 <_Q <_ most .  (5 . 8) Thus , from the dispositions in question we can infer the disposition dA students are  , ingle and young on the understanding that the implicit fuzzy quantifier in disexpressed by  ( 5 . 8) . 
6. Negation of Dispositlona
In dealing with dispositions , it is natural to raise the question : What happens when a disposition is acted upon with an operator  , T , where T might be the operation of negation , active-to-passive transformation , etc . More generally , the same question may be asked when T is an operator which is defined on pairs or n-tuples of disp?sitions  . 
As an illustration , we shall focus our attention on the operation of negation  . More specifically , the question which we shall consider briefly is the following : Given a disposition  , d , what can be said about the negaton of d , not d ? For example , what can be said about not ( birds can fly ) or not ( young men like young women )  . 
For simplicity , assume that , after restoration , dmay be expressed in the form rdAQAWs are B Is  .  (6 . 1)
Then , not d = not(QA'soreB's ) .  (6 . 2) Now , using the semantic equivalence established in Zadeh  ( 1978 )  , we may write not ( QA's are B's ) E ( not Q ) A's or eB'o ,  (6 . 3 ) where not Q is the complement of the fuzzy quantifier Q in the sense that the membership function of not Q is given by P  , ,ot Q(u ) . ~-1-pQ(u ), 0 < u < 1 .  (6 . 4) Furthermore , the following inference rule can readily be established  ( gade h , 1983a):
QA ' so reB's(0 . 5 )  ~__  ( ant Q ) AIs arc not B to ' where ant Q denotes the antonym of Q  , defined by ~ ,   ,   , ~( u ) = ~ q(1-n ) , o < u < 1 ,  (6 . o ) On combining (0 . 3) and (0 . 5) , we are led to the following result : not ( QA#s are B's ) =  ( 6 . 7) >_( oat(not q )) A ' oore not Bt , which reduces to not ( qA's are B '*) = (0 . 8) ( ant(notq )) A ' , are not B '* if Q is monotonic ( e . g . , QA most ) . 
As an illustration , if dAbirds canfly and QA most , then (0 . 8 ) yields not ( birds can fly )   ( ant ( not most ) ) birds cannot f l y . ( o . g ) It should be observed that if Q is an approximation to all  , then ant ( not Q ) is an approximation to some . For the right hand member of (0 . 9) to be a disposition , most must be will be an approximation to most , and consequently the righthand member of (0 . 9 ) may be expressed--up on the suppression of most -- as the disposition birds cannot fly  .
