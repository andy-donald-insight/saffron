Abstract
This paper compares the consislency -
based account of agreement phenomena
in ' unification-based'grammars with an implication-based account based on a simple feature extension to Lambek Catego-rim Grammar  ( LCG )  . We show that the LCG treatment accounts for constructions that have been recognized as problematic for ' unification-based'treatments  . 
1 Introduction
This paper contrasts the treatment of agreement phenomena in standard complex feature structure or ' unification-based'grammar such as HPSG  ( Pollard and Sag ,  1994 ) with that of perhaps the simplest possible feature extension to Lambek Categorial Grammar  ( LCG )   ( Lambek ,  1958) . We identify a number of situations where the two accounts make different predictions  , and find that generally the LCG account is superior  . In the process we provide analyses for a number of constructions that have been recognized as problematic for ' unification-based'accounts of agreements  ( Zaenen and Karttunen , 1984; Pullum and Zwicky , 1986; Ingria ,  1990) . Our account builds on the analysis of coordination in applicative categorial grammar in Bayer  ( 1994 ) and the treatment of Boolean connectives in LCG provided by Morrill  ( 1992 )  . Our analysis is similiar to that proposed by Mineur  ( 1993 )  , but differs both in its application and details . 
The rest of the paper is structured as follows . The next section describes the version of LCG we use in this paper  ; for reasons of space we assume familiarity with the treatment of agreement in ' unification-based 'grammars  , see Shieber ( 1986 ) and Pollard and Sag ( 1994 ) for details . Then each of the follow-*We would like to thank Bob Carpenter  , Pauline Jacobson , John Maxwell , Glynn Morrill and audiences at Brown University , the University of Pennsylvani and the Universit?t Stuttgart for helpful comments on this work  . Naturally all errors remain our own . 
ing sections up to the conclusion discusses an important difference between the two approaches  . 
2 Features in Lambek Categorial

In LCG semantic interpretation and long distance dependencies are handled independently of the feature system  , so agreement phenomena seem to be the major application of a feature system for LCG  . 
Since only a finite number of feature distinctions need to be made in all the cases of agreement we know of  , we posit only a very simple feature system here . Roughly speaking , features will be treated as atomic propositions ( we have no need to separate them into attributes and values  )  , and a simple category will be a Boolean combination of such atomic ' features '  ( since we have no reason to posit a recursive feature structures either  )  . In fact we are agnostic as to whether more complex feature systems for LCG are linguistically justified  ; in any event Dorre et . al .   ( 1994 ) show how a full attribute-value feature structure system having the properties described here can be incorporated into LCG  . 
Following the standard formulation of LCG , we regard the standard LCG connectives '/' and ' V as directed implications  , so we construct our system so that a//~fl ~ can combine to form a iff l ' is logically stronger than / ~  . 
Formally , we adopt Morrill's treatment ( Morrill ,  1992 ) of the ( semantically impotent ) Boolean connectives '^' and ' v' ( Morrill named these ' lq ' and '11' respectively )  . Given a set of atomic features 5 , we define the set of feature terms 7- and categories g as follows , where '/' and ' V are the standard LCG forward and backward implication operators  . 
7-: := Y=+7-^7-+7-v7-
C::=7-+C/C+C\?
In general , atomic categories in a standard catego-rim grammar will be replaced in our analyses with formulae drawn from  7-  . For example , the NPKim might be assigned by the lexicon to the category  np^sg^3  , the verb sleeps to the category s\np nsg^3 , or number features on its subject ) to the category s\np . 
To simplify the presentation of the proofs , we formulate our system in natural deduction terms  , and specify the properties of the Boolean connectives using the single inference rule P  , rather than providing separate rules for each connective  . 
~ P where I - in the calculus .   1? ? propositional The rule P allows us to replace any formula in T with a logically weaker one  . For example , since Kim is assigned to the category np ^ sgA3 , then by rule Pit will belong to np as well . 
Finally , we assume the standard LCG introduction and elimination rules for the directed implication operators  .

For example , the following proof of the wellformedness of the sentence Kim slept can be derived using the rules just given and the lexical assignments described above  .

Pups\npferences between the standard treatment of agreement in ' unification-based'grammar and this treatment of agreement in LCG  . In the ' unification-based'accounts agreement is generally asymmetric relationship between the agreeing constituents : both agreeing constituents impose constraints on a shared agreement value  , and the construction is wellformed iff these constraints are consistent  . 
However , in the LCG treatment of agreement proposed here agreement is inherently asymmetric  , in 1Because conjunction and disjunction are the only connectives we permit  , it does not matter whether we use the classical or intuitionistic propositional calculus here  . In fact , if categorie such as np and a pare ' decomposed ' into the conjunctions of atomic features + noun A- -verb and q-noun ^+ verb respectively as in the Sag et  . at . (1985) analysis discussed below , disjunction is not required in any of the LCG analyses below  . However , Bayer ( 1994 ) argues that such a decomposition is not always plausible  . 
that an argument must logically imply , or be subsumed by , the antecedent of the predicate it combines with . Thus in the example above , the rule P could be used to ' weaken'the argument from  npAsgA3 to rip , but it would not allow np ( without agreement features ) to be ' strengthened ' to , say , npASgA3 . 
Abstracting from the details of the feature systems  , we can characterize the ' unification-based ' approach as one in which agreement is possible between two constituents with feature specifications ? and ? iff ? and ? are consistent  , whereas the LCG approach requires that the argument ? implies the corresponding antecedent ? of the predicate  ( i . e . , Interestingly , in cases where features are fully specified , these subsumption and consistency requirements are equivalent  . More precisely , say that a formula ? from a feature constraint language fixes an atomic feature constraint X iff ? ~ X or ?-~ X-For example  , in single-valued feature systems ( person ) = 1 and ( person ) = 3 both fix ( person )  = 1 , ( person ) = 2 , ( person ) = 3 , etc . , and in general all fully-specified agreement constraints fix the same set of formulae  . 
Nowlet ? and ? be two satisfiable formulae that fix the same set of atomic feature constraints  . Then A ? is consistent if f ? ~? . To see this , note that because ? and ? fix the same set of formulae  , each condition holds iff ? and ? are elementarily equivalent  ( i . e . , for each feature constraint X , ? ~ X iff ? ~ X)-However , the role of partial agreement feature specifications in the two systems is very different  . 
The following sections explore the empirical consequences of these two approaches  . We focus on coordination phenomena because this is the one area of the grammar where underspecified agreement features seem to play a crucial linguistic role  , and cannot be regarded merely as an abbreviatory device for a disjunction of fully-specified agreement values  . 
3 Coord inat ion and agreement asymmetr ies Interestingly  , the analysis of coordination is the one place where most ' unification-based'accounts abandon the symmetric on sistency-based treatment of agreement and adopt an asymmetric subsumption -based account  . Working in the GPSG framework Saget . al .   ( 1985 ) proposed that the features on a conjunction must be the most specific category which subsumes each conjunct  ( called the generalization by Shieber ( 1992 ) ) . Shieber (1986) proposed a weaker condition , namely that the features on the conjunction must subsume the features on each conjunct  , as expressed in the annotated phrase struc-bec ~raewealthy and a Republican wealthy a Republican and npapP becamenp vape on jnpvapvp/npvap npvap vp

ture rule below ( Shieber , 1992) . 2 In all of the exam-pies we discuss below , the features associated with a conjunction is the generalization of the features associated with each of its conjuncts  , so our conclusions are equally valid for both the generalization and subsumption accounts of coordination  . 
(1) Xo , Xlconj X2 where X0 E X1 and X0 E X2 Consider the sentences in ( 2 )  . Decomposing the categories N ( oun ) and A ( djective ) into the Boolean-valued features ( noun )  = + , ( verb ) = - and ( noun ) = + , ( verb ) = + respectively , the fact that became can select for either an NP or an AP complement  ( 2a ) can be captured by analysing it as subcat -egorizing for a complement whose category is underspecified  ; i . e . , its complement satisfies ( noun ) = + , and no constraint is imposed on the verb feature . 
(2) a . Kim\[vbecame\]\[hv wealthy\]/\[NP a Republican \] b  . Kim\[vP\[v became\]l AP wealthy\]and\[NP a Republican \]\] Now consider the coordination in  ( 2b )  . Assuming that became selects the underspecified category  ( noun )  = + , the features associated with the coordination subsume the features associated with each coordinate  , as required by rule (1) , so ( 2b ) has the wellformed structure shown in Figure 1 . 
On the other hand , a verb such as grew which selects solely AP complements  ( 3a ) requires that its complement satisfies ( noun )  = + , ( verb ) = + . 
Thus the features on the coordinate structure in ( 3b ) must include ( verb ) = + and so do not subsume the ( verb ) =- feature on the NP complement , correctly predicting the ungrammatieality of (3b ) .

Our LCG account analyses these constructions in a similar way  . Because the LCG account of agreement has subsumption ' builtin '  , the coordination rule merely requires identity of the conjunction and each of the conjuncts  . 
A conjA


Condition : Noun discharged assumptions in any conjunct  . 3 We provide an LCG derivation of ( 2b ) in Figure 2 . Roughly speaking , rule P allows both the AP wealthy and the NP a Republicanto'weaken't on pvap  , so the conjunction satisfies the antecedent of the predicate became  .   ( This weakening also takes place in non -coordination example such as Kim became wealthy  )  . On the other hand ,   ( 3b ) is correctly predicted to be ill-formed because the strongest possible category for the coordination is npvap  , but this does not imply the ' stronger ' ap antecedent of grew  , so the derivation in Figure 3 cannot proceed to form avp . 
Thus on these examples , the feature-based subsumption account and the LCG of complement coordination constructions impose similiar feature constraints  ; they both require that the predicate's feature specification of the complement subsumes the features of each of the arguments  . In the feature-based account , this is because the features associated with a conjunction must subsume the features  3This condition in effect makes conjunctions into islands  . Morrill ( 1992 ) shows how such island constraints can be expressed using modal extensions to LCG  . 
72 associated with each conjunct , while in the LCG account the features associated with the complement specification in a predicate must subsume those associated with the complement itself  . 
Now consider the related construction in ( 4 ) involving conjoined predicates as well conjoined arguments  . Similar constructions , and their relevance to the GPSG treatment of coordination  , were first discussed by Ja cobson (1987) . In such cases , the feature-based subsumption account requires that the features associated with the predicate conjunction subsume those associated with each predicate conjunct  . This is possible , as shown in Figure 4 . Thus the feature structure subsumption account incorrectly predicts the wellformedness of  ( 4 )  . 
(4) * Kim\[grew and remained\]\[wealthy and a
Republican \].
Because the subsumption constraint in the LCG analysis is associated with the predicate -argument relationship  ( rather than the coordination construction , as in the feature-based subsumption account ) , an LCG analysis paralleling the one given in Figure  4 does not exist . By introducing and with drawing a hypothetical p constituent as shown in Figure  5 it is possible to conjoing rew and remained , but the resulting conjunction belongs to the category vp/ap  , and cannot combine with the wealthy and a Repub -lican  , which belongs to the category npvap . 
Informally , while rule P allows the features associated with an argument to be weakened  , together with the introduction and elimination rules it permits the argument specifications of predicates to be strengthened  ( e . f . the subproof showing that remained belongs to category vp/apin Figure  5  )  . As were marked earlier , in LCG predicates are analysed as ( directed ) implicational formulae , and the argument features required by a predicate appear in the antecedent of such formulae  . Since strengthening the antecedent of an implication weakens the implication as a whole  , the combined effect of rule P and the introduction and elimination rules is to permit the overall weakening of a category  . 
4 Consistency and agreement
Complex feature structure analyses of agreement require that certain combinations of feature constraints are inconsistent in order to correctly reflect agreement failure  . For example , the agreement failure in him runs is reflected in the inconsistency of the constraints  ( case ) = acc and ( case ) = nor a . In the LCG account presented above , the agreement failure in him runs is reflected by the failure of acc to imply nor a  , not by the inconsistency of the features acc and nor a  . Thus in LCG there is no principled reason not to assign a category an apparently contradictory feature specification such as np^nom^acc  ( this might be a reasonable lxical category assignment for an NP such as Kim  )  .

Figure 6: The feature structure subsumption analysis of ( 5c )  . 
Consider the German examples in (5) , cited by Pullum and Zwicky ( 1986 ) and Ingria ( 1990 )  . These examples show that while the conjunction finder und hilf t cannot take either a purely accusative  ( 5a ) or dative complement ( 5b )  , it can combine with the NP Frauen (5c ) , which can appear in both accusative and dative contexts  .

Frauen women-ACC+DAT
Contrary to the claim by Ingria (1990) , these examples can be accounted for straightforwardly using the standard feature subsumption-based account of coordination  . Now , this account presupposes the existence of appropriate underspecified categories  ( e . g . , in the English example above it was crucial that major category labels were decomposed into the features noun and verb  )  . Similarly , we decompose the four nominal cases in German into the ' subcase ' features obj  ( abbreviating ' objective ' ) and dir ( for ' direct ' ) as follows . 



Genetive ( air ) = + , ( obj ) = -= + , ( obj ) = + ( air ) = - , ( obj ) = + ( d , r ) = - ,   ( obj ) =-By assigning the NPs Mh'nner and Kindern the fully specified case feature shown above  , and Frauen the underspecified case feature ( obj )  = + , both the feature structure generalization and subsumption accounts of coordination fail to generate the ungrammatical  ( 5a ) and ( hb )  , and correctly accept (5c ) , as shown in Figure 6 .

As in the previous example , the LCG approach does not require the case feature to be decomposed  . However , as shown in Figure 7 it does assign the conjunction finder und hilf l to the category p/np^ace^dat  ; hence the analysis requires that Frauenbe assigned to the ' in consistent ' category np ^ accAdat  . Such overspecified or ' inconsistent ' features may seem ad hoc and unmotivated  , but they arise naturally in the formal framework of 
Morrill's extended LCG.
In fact , they seem to be necessary to obtain a linguistically correct description of coordination i German  . Consider the ungrammatical ' double coordination ' example in  ( 6 )  . Both the feature structure generalization ad subsumption accounts incorrectly predict it to be wellformed  , as shown in Figure 8 . 
(6 ) *Erf in detund hilftM~nner und he find-ACC and help-DAT men-ACC and 
Kindern children-DAT
However , the LCG analysis systematically distinguishes between Frauen  , which is assigned to the category npAaccAdat , and Mdnner und Kindern , which is assigned to the weaker category np ^ ( accvdat )  . 
Thus the LCG analysis correctly predicts ( 6 ) to be ungrammatical , as shown in Figure 9 . The distinction between the categories npAacc_dat and np ^  ( accvdat )  , and hence the existence of the apparently inconsistent categories  , eems to be crucial to the ability to distinguish between the grammatical  ( 5c ) and the ungrammatical ( 6 )  . 
5 Conclusion
This paper has examined some of the differences between a standard complex feature-structure account of agreement  , which is fundamentally organized around a notion of consistency  , and an account in an extended version of LCG , in which agreement is fundamentally an asymmetric relationship  . 
We have attempted to show that the LCG account of agreement correctly treats a number of cases of coordination which are problematic for the standard feature-based account  . Although we have not shown this here , the LCG account extend straight-forwardly to the cases of coordination and morphological neutralization discussed by Zaenen and Kar -tunen  ( 1984 )  , Pullum and Zwicky (1986) and Ingria (1990) . 
The nature of an appropriate feature system for LCG is still an open question  . It is perhap surpris-ing that the simple feature system proposed here can handle such complex linguistic phenomena  , but additional mechanisms might be required to treat other linguistic onstructions  . The standard account of adverbial modification i standard LCG  , for instance , treat . ~adverbs as functors .

Using the LCG account described above it is necessary to treat adverbs as ambiguous  , assigning them to the categories ( \ np ^ s g ) \ ( s\np^sg ) and ( s\np^pl )  \  ( s\np^pl )  . 
There are several approaches which may eliminate the need for such systematic ambiguity  . First , if the language of ( category ) types is extended to permit universally quantified types as suggested by Mor-rill  ( Morrill ,  1992) , then adverbs could be assigned to the single type

Second , it might be possible to reanalyse adjunction in such a way that avoids the problem altogether  . 
For example , Bouma and van Noord ( 1994 ) show that assuming that head subcategorize for adjuncts  ( rather than the other way around , as is standard ) permits a particularly elegant account of the double infinitive construction i Dutch  . If adjuncts in general are treated as arguments of the head  , then the ' problem ' of ' passing features ' through adjunction disappears  . 
The comparative computational complexity of both the unification-based approach and the LCG accounts is also of interest  . Despite their simplicity , the computational complexity of the kinds of feature-structure and LCG grammars discussed here is largely unknown  . Dorre et . al .   ( 1992 ) showed that the satisfiability problem for systems of feature-structure subsumption and equality constraints i undecidable  , but it is not clear if such problems can arise in the kinds of feature-structure grammars discussed above  . Conversely , while terminating ( Gentzen ) proof procedures are available for extended LCG systems of the kind we presented here  , none of these handle the coordination schema , and as far as we are aware the computational properties of systems which include this schema relargely unexplored  .
