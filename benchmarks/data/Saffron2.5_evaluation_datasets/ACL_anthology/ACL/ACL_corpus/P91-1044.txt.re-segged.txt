1 Introduction
The need to represent actions arises in many different areas of investigation  , such as philosophy \[5\] , semantics\[10\] , and planning . In the first two areas , representations are generally developed without any computational concerns  . The third area sees action representation mainly as functional to the more general task of reaching a certain goal : actions have often been represented by a predicate with some arguments  , such as move ( John , block 1 , room 1 , room 2) , augmented with a description of its effects and of what has to be true in the world for the action to be executable  \[8\]  . Temporal relations between actions\[1\] , and the generation relation \[12\] , \[2\] have also been explored . 
However , if weever want to be able to give instructions in NL to active agents  , such as robots and animated figures , we should start looking at the characteristics of action descriptions in NL  , and devising formalisms that should be able to represent these characteristics  , at least in principle . NL action descriptions axe complex , and so are the inferences the agent interpreting them is expected to draw  . 
As far as the complexity of action descriptions goes  , consider : Ex . 1 Using a paint roller or brush , apply paste to the wall , starting at the ceiling line and pasting down a few feet and covering an area a few inches wider than the width of the fabric  . 
The basic description apply paste to the wall is augmented with the instrument to be used and with direction and eztent modifiers  . The richness of the possible modifications argues against representing actions as predicates having a fixed number of arguments  . 
Among the many complex inferences that an agent interpreting instructions i assumed to be able to draw  , one type is of particular interest tome , namely , the interaction between the intentional description of an action-which I'll call the goal or the why-and * This research was supported by DARPA grant no  .

333 its executable counterpart-the how 1 . Consider : Ex . 2a ) Place a plank between two ladders to create a simple scaffold  . 
b ) Place a plank between two ladders.
In both a ) and b) , the action to be executed is a place a plank between two ladders ~  . However , Ex .  2 . b would be correctly interpreted by placing the plank anywhere between the two ladders : this shows that in a  ) the agent must be inferring the proper position for the plank from the expressed why " to create a simple scaffold LMy concern is with representations that allow specification of both bow's and why's  , and with reasoning that allows inferences such as the above to be made  . In the rest of the paper , I will argue that a hybrid representation formalism is best suited for the knowledge I need to represent  . 
2 A hybrid action representa-t ion formalism As I have argued elsewhere based on analysis of naturally occurring data  \[14\]  ,  \[7\] , actions-action types , to be precise-must be part of the underlying ontology of the representation formalism  ; partial action descriptions must be taken as basic  ; not only must the usual participants in an action such as agent or patient be represented  , but also means , manner , direction , extent etc . 
Given these basic assumptions , it seems that knowledge about actions falls into the following two categories :  1  . Terminological knowledge about an action type : its participants and its relation to other action -types that it either specializes or abstracts - e  . g . slice specializes cut , loosen ascrew carefully specializes loosen a screw  . 
2 . Non-terminological knowledge . First of all , knowledge about the effects expected to occur 1V~ta  . texecutable means is debatable : see for example \[12\]  , p . 63 ff . 
when an action of a given type is performed.
Because effects may occur during the performance of an action  , the basic aspectua \] profile of the action type \[11\] should also be included . 
Clearly , this knowledge is not terminological ; in Ex .   3 Turn the screw counter clockwise but don't loosen it completely  . 
the modifier not . . . completely does not affect the fact that don't loosen it completely is a loos-ening action : only its default culmination condition is affected  . 
Also , non-terminological knowledge must include information about relations between action-types : temporal  , generation , enablement , and testing , whereby testing I refer to the relation between two actions  , one of which is a test on the outcome or execution of the other  . 
The generation relation was introduced by Goldman in  \[9\]  , and then used in planning by \[1\] ,  \[12\] ,   \[2\]: it is particularly interesting with respect othe representation fhow's and why's  , because it appears to be the relation holding between an intentional description of an action and its executable counterpart-see  \[12\]  . 
This knowledge can be seen as common . sense planning knowledge , which includes facts such as to loosen a screw , you have to turn it coun-tere lockwise , but not recipes to achieve a certain goal \[2\] , such as how to assemble a piece of furniture . 
The distinction between terminological nd non -terminological knowledge was put forward in the past as the basis of hybrid KR system  , such as those that stemmed from the KL-ONE formalism  , for example KRYPTON\[3\] , KL-TWO\[13\] , and more recently CLASSIC\[4\] . Such systems provide an assertional part , or ABox , used to assert facts or beliefs , and a terminological part , or TBox , that accounts for the meaning of the complex terms used in these assertions  . 
In the past however , it has been the case that terms defined in the Tbox have been taken to correspond to noun phrases in Natural Language  , while verbs are mapped onto the predicates used in the assertion stored in the Abox  . What I am proposing here is that , to represent action-types , verb phrases too have to map to concepts in the TBox  . I am advocating a 1:1 mapping between verbs and action type names . This is a reasonable position , given that the entities in the underlying ontology come from NL  . 
The knowledge Iamencoding in the Tbox is at the linguistic level : an action description is composed of a verb  , i . e . an action type name , its arguments and possibly , some modifiers . The ABox contains the non-terminological knowledge delineated above  . 
I have started using CLASSIC to represent actions : it is clear that I need to tailor it to my needs  , because explore the feasibility of adopting techniques similar to those used in CLASP  \[6\] to represent what I called common sense planning knowledge : CLASP builds on top of CLASSIC to represent actions  , plans and scenarios . However , in CLASP actions are still traditionally seen as STRIPS-like operators  , with pre - and postconditions : as I hope to have shown  , there is much more to action descriptions than that  .
