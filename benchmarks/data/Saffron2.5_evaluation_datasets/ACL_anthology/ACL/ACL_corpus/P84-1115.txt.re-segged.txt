The results of an international Delphipollon information linguistics which was carried out between  1982 and 1983 are presented . 
As part of conceptual work being done in information science at the University of Constance an international Delphipollwss carried out from  1982 to 1983 with the aim of establishing a midterm pro@aosis for the development of " information linguistics  "  . The term " information linguistics " refers to a scientific discipline combining the fields of linguistic data processing  , applied computer science , linguistics , artificial intelligence , and information science . A Delphipoll is a written poll of experts - carried out in this case in two phases  . The results of the first round were incorporated into the second round  , so that participants in the poll could react to the trends as they took shape  . 
I . Some demoscopic data
I . I Return rate
Based on sophisticated selection procedures 385 international experts in the field of information linguistics were determined and were sent questionnaires in the first round  ( April 1982 )  . 90 questionnaires were returned . In the second round 360 questionnaires were mailed out ( January 1983 ) and 56 were returned ,   48 of these from experts who had answered in the first round  . The last questionnaires were accepted at the end of June  1   983  . 
Overlapping data in the two rounds first round ( 90 ) second round ( 56 )   2   48   8 In the following we refer to four sets of data :
Set A90 from round I
Set--B 48 from round I with answers in round 2   8et--C   56 from round 2 Set--D 48 from round 2 with answers in round IBut we shall concentrate primarily on Set C be can se-according to the Delphiphilosophy-t ~ edata of the second round are the most relevant  . There were 8 persons within Set C who did not answer in the first round  . But the ~ also were aware of the results of the first round  ; therefore a Delphi effect was possible .   ( In the following the whole integers refer to absolute numbers  ; the decimal figures to relative/procentual numbers  ) I . 2 Qualification accordin ~ to academic degree The survey singled out highly competent people  , as reflected in academic degree ( data from A and C ) :

Since Delphipolls are concerned with future developments  , it has been claimed in the past that the age and experience of people in the field influence the rating  . In this paper , however , we cannot prove this hypothesis . Here are the mere statistical facts , only taken from SetC ( they do not differ significantly in the other- -sets  )

These topics were chosen based on the author's experience in information linguistics  , on a pretest with mostly German researchers and practitioners  , on advices from members of FID/LD , and on long discussions with DonWalker , Hans Karlgren , and Udo Hahn . Altogether , there were 91 topics in the first round and 90 in the second round , as follows: .

3 . Answer parameters for the subareas3 . 1 Competence ( -- CO ) At the beginning of every subare a participants were requested to rate their competence according to three parameters " good "  ( with a speciai is t's knowledge )  , " fair " ( with a working knowledge) , and " superficial " ( with a layman's knowledge ) .

With respect to the application oriented subject are as the category of desirability was used in order to determine the social desirability according to the following  4-point scale : " very desirable "/+ + ( will have a positive social effect , little or no negative social effect , extremely beneficial ) , " desirable "/+ ( in general positive , minor negative social effects ) , " undesirable "/- ( negative social effect , socially harmful ) , " veryur ~ esirable "/ m ( major negative social effect , socially not justifiable ) . 
Tab . 9  ( data from Set C ) shows that the negative parameters ( -- , -) -- were never or only sel~om used . Information linguistics is not judged-accordir ~ to the estimation of the experts-as a socially harmful scientific discipline  . 
4 . Answer parameters for the single topics The following parameters were used as ratin ~ for the subareas and the single topics  . Their definitions were given in more detail in the questionnaire  .

ISub-areas5 . 1 . 1 Competence Competence was an important influence on evaluation  . In general one can say that people with " good " competence  ( or more correctly : with competence estimation of " good "  ) in a subare a gave topics higher ratings for importance and feasibility both from the research and the application points of view  . Nevertheless , there were differences . Those with " good " competence differed more widely in evaluations of research-oriented topics than in applica-tion-oriented topics  , whereas those with " superficial " competence in the subareas were closer to the average in their evaluations of applica-tion-oriented topics than of research-oriented topics  . Here are some examples of the differences ( as reflected in the averages of the subare as )  . 
Tab . 11 is to be read as follows: ( line I ) in the subarea " Acoustic " those with " good " competence evaluated  5  . 6% higher than the average with respect to importance for research  , whereas people with " superficial " competence in the same subarea evaluated  6  . 9% lower than average .

As can be seen in the column F/R , sometimes the general trend is reversed ( Semantic : values from " competent " participants are lower than from participants with " superficial " competence  )  . 
5.1.2 Desirability
There is also a connection between desirability and the values of importance and feasibility  . Those who gave high ratin ~ s for desirability ( DE++ ) in general gave higher values to the single topics in the respective subare as  , both in comparison to the average values and to the values of those who gave only high desirability  ( DE + ) to a given subarea . The differences between DE++and DE+are even higher than those between C/g und C/s  .   0nly the F/R data in the translation and retrieval areas are lower for D ++ than for D +  , in all other cases the D++values are higher .

The average values in Tab . 13 and 14 should not be over-interpreted . In particular , ranking is unjustified . One cannot simply conclude that , say , the subarea " Semantics " (92 . 6 ) is more important than that of " Abstracting " ( 75 . 6 ) with respect to research because the average value is higher  ; or that Indexing (79 . 2 ) is more feasible from an application point of view than Abstracting  ( 52 . 3) . $ uch conclusions may be true , and this is why the values in Tab . 13 and 14 are given , but the parameters should actually only be applied to the single topics in the subare as  . Cross-group ranking is not allowed for methodological reasons  . 
But nevertheless the
It is obvious that general true : data are interesting enough  . 
the following relation is in
I/R (- values ) > I/A > F/R > F/A
There are some exceptions to this general rule , such as Re-I/A>I/R ( both in SetA and SetC) ; Ha-F/R>I/R ( in SetC) ; ( Re-F/Rant F/A ) > I/R --( in Set_C) ; and I1-F/R > ~/ R ( both in Set_A and SetC) . 
There seems to be a nontrivial g~p between importance and feasibility  ( both with respect to research and application )  . In other words , there are more problems than solutions . And there is an even broader gap between application and research  . 
From a practical point of view there is some skep -sisconcerning the possibility of solving important research problems  . And what seems to be feasible from a research point of view looks different from an application one  . 
The values in the second round are in general higher than in the first one  . This is an argument against the oft cited Delphi hypothesis that the feedback-mechanism-i  . e . that the data of the previous round are made known at the start of the following round-has an averaging effect  . The increase-effect can probably be explained by the fact that the percentage of qualified and " com-petent " people was higher in the second round perhaps these were the ones who were motivated to take on the burden of a second round  ) - and , as Tab . 11 shows , people who rated themselves " competent " tend to evaluate higher  . 
Between the two rounds the decline in the subare as "Software " and " Hardware "  ( apart from the parameter F/R ) is striking . There is an overall increase for '% lorphology " and " Information Languages " for all parameters  , and a dramatic increase for the topics in " Indexing " for F/R  ( 9 . 7%) , and a dramatic decline for the " Translation "- and " Ques-tion-Answering "- topics for the parameter F/A  ( 9 . 8 and 8 . 4%) . 
The dates of realization do not change dramatically ? On the average there is a difference of one year  ( and this makes sense because there was almost one year between round I and  2  )  . There is a tendency from a research point of view for the expectation of realization to be somewhat earlier from an application standpoint  . But the differences are not so dramatic as to justify the conclusion that researchers are more optimistic than developers/practitioners  . 
5.2 Single topics
Tab .   15 and 16 show the two highestrated topics in each subarea in the first two columns and the two lowest rated topics in each sub area in the last two columns  . These represent average data from Set C . The four columns in the middle show the estimation of participants who work in research or application  , respectively . As part of the demos-copic data it was determined whether participants work more in research or in application  ( cf . 
Tab . 6) . Notice that both groups answered from a research and application point of view  . In a more detailed analysis ( which will be published later ) this - and other aspects-can be pursued . In Tab . 15 and 16 the data for very high importance ( *+ ) and high importance ( + ) have been added together .

It was an extremely time-consuming task to answer the questionnaire  , which was more like a book than a folder . I hope the results justify the efforts . The analysis would not have been possible without the help of m ~ colleagues - U do Hahn for the conceptual desi ~ a  , and Dr . J . Staud together with Annette Woehrle , Frank Dittmar and Gerhard Schneider for the statistical analysis  . This project has been partially financed by the FID/LD-comnittee and by the " Bundesminis-terium fuer Forschung und Technologie/Gesellschaft fuer Information und Dokumentation "  , Grant PT200 . 08 .
