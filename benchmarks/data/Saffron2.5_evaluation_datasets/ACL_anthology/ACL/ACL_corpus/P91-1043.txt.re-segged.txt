Although most NLP researchers agree that a level of " logical form " is a necessary step toward the goal of representing the meaning of a sentence  , few people agree on the content and form of this level of representation  . An even smaller number of people have considered the complex action sentences that are often expressed in task-oriente dialogues  . Most existing logical form representations have been developed for single-clause sentences that express assertions about properties or actual actions and in which time is not a main concern  . In contrast , utterances in task-oriented dialogues often express unre-alized actions  , e . g . , ( la ) , multiple actions and relations between them , e . g . , ( lb ), and temporal information , e . g . , ( lc ) : (1) a . What about rereading the Operations manual ? b . By getting the key and unlocking the gate , you get ten points . 
c . When the red fight goes off , push the handle.
In the following sections , I discuss the issues that arise in defining the logical form of these three types of sentences  . The Davidsonian treatment of action sentences is the most appropriate for my purposes because it treats actions as individuals  \[7\]  . For example , the logical form of " Jones buttered the to as t " is a three place predicate  , including an argument position for the action being described  , i . e . , 3x butter(jones , to as t,x ) . The presence of the action variable makes it possible to represent optional modifiers as predications of actions and to refer to actions in subsequent discourse  . Furthermore , and more importantly for the present purpose , it facilitates the representation of sentences about multiple actions and relations between them  . 
Unrealized-action sentences
A Davidsonian logical form of sentence ( la ) , namely 3x reread ( us , manual , x ) , makes the claim that there exists a particular action x  . But this is not the intended meaning of the sentence  . Instead , this sentence concerns a hypothetical action . The same problem arises with sentences ( lb ) and ( lc ) which state how typical actions are related or when to perform a future action  . 
Apparently , Davidson did not have these types of action in mind when suggesting h is theory of logical form  . 
In fact , a closer look at the literature shows that the problem of representing action sentences that do * This research as been supported by US West Advanced Technologies  , by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research under Contract No  . AFOSR-89-0273, and by an IBM Graduate Fellowship . 
3 31 not make claims about actions that have or are occurring  ( i . e . , actual actions ) has been virtually ignored . 
Hobbs , who also adopts a Davidsonian treatment of action sentences  , is one notable exception \[11\] . His " Pla-tonic universe " contains everything that can be spoken of and the predicate Exist is used to make statements about the existence in the actual universe of individuals in the Platonic universe  . For example , the formula Exists(x ) A run '( x , john ) says that the action of John's running exists in the actual universe  , or , more simply , that John runs . The approach I am currently investigating is to extend I to bbs ' representation by introducing predicates stating the existence of actions in future  , hypothetical or typical worlds as well as in the actual world  . 
Another possibility is to adopt the standard philosophical approach to the representation of properties  , and for that matter , of actions , that are not actually instantiated , namely possible worlds ( cf .  \[13, 2\]) . Furthermore , and independently of the approach that is adopted  , there is a need to identify the differentypes of unrealized actions and determine whether they should be distinguished in the logical form  . 
Multi-clause sentences
Another area of logical form that has not received much attention is the representation f sentences about multiple actions and relations between them  . I have been investigating sentences including by - and to-purpose clauses because they are used to communicate two action relations  , namely generation and enablement , which I have defined elsewhere\[3\] . In a Davidsonian logical form , the connectives " by " and " to " can be represented as two-place predicates ranging over action  tokens1  ; e . g . : (2) To learn how to use the system , read the manual . 
learn ( you , system , xa ) Aread ( you , manual , x2)A in order to(x2 , xa ) Clauses may also be joined with coordination conjunctions  , e . g . , (3a ) , and the resulting constituent may participate in another action relation  , as in ( lb ) and repeated below in (3b ) . I therefore represent these con-neetives by a three place predicate  , e . g . , and(xl , x2 , x4 ) which is true if action x4 is the conjunction of actions xl and x2  . In (3a ) , the action token x4 might seem superfluous , but note that it becomes necessary if that action is referred to in subsequent discourse  ( e . g . , " Do aAlthough this problem interacts with the one discussed in the previou section  , for the purpose of this presentation , Icall Davidson's action variables action tokens and represent them as constants in the logical form  . 
it fast !"); in (3b ) , the action token z4 can then be used as the first argument to the by predicate :  ( 3 ) a . Get the key and unlock the gate . 
get ( you , key , xl ) ^ un Zock ( yo , , , gate , x2)^ and ( xl , x2 , x4) b . By getting the key and unlocking the gate , you get ten points . 
get ( you , key , xl ) ^ unlock ( you , gate , z2)^ get ( you , lO points , z3)^ and ( z1 , z2 , z4) ^ by ( x4 , za ) In the above logical forms , I assume that the by and in order to predicates denote a two place relation expressing the " ideal meaning " of the corresponding English connective  \[9\]  . There is not necessarily a one-to-one mapping between particular linguistic expressions and action relations  , and subsequent pragmatic processing of the logical forms will further interprethese relations  . 
Representing the embedded clause as an additional argument o the predicate representing the matrix clause  ( e . g . , \[5\]) , or representing the relation as a binary sentential operator  ( e . g . , \[16\]) are alternative representations , both of which suffer from problems discussed by Davids on because action tokens become irrelevant  . Furthermore , the first does not capture the intuitive notion that these sentences express action relations  , and the second introduces a lack of homogeneity between logical forms of sentences involving action relations and those that do not  . 

Still another feature that has been overlooked in the study of logical form is time  . Although a number of papers include time in their logical forms  , most do not discuss their treatment of time and consider primarily past and presentense examples about actual actions  ( e . g . , \[1, 5, 1412) . The lack of concern for temporal issues is also characteristic of the literature on semantic interpretation  ( e . g . , \[10, 15, 16\]) . On the other hand , there is a vast literature on the interpretation and representation of tense  , aspect and temporal modifiers , but these papers do not describe the logical forms from which their representations are generated  ( e . g . , \[4, 6, 8, 12, 17, 18\]) . 
Clearly , there is a missing link between the literature on logical form and that on tense and aspect  . Providing such a link is one of the goals of this research  . David-son's treatment of action sentences does not provide a fully satisfying starting point  . Although his initial paper does not include any example of temporal modifiers  , he would probably represent them as predicates over action tokens  , e . g . , next_week(x ) , a representation that does not make explicit reference to time  ( to which anaphors might refer )  . Introducing a time predicate , e . g . , time(z , next_week ) , solves this particular problem , but introduces other complexities because this predicate would not be adequate for all temporal modifiers  ( e . g . , compare Sue will leave in two hours and Sue reached the top in two hours  )  . Given that the aspectual type and tense of the verb  , along with the presence of adverbials and common sense knowledge all interact in the interpretation of the temporal information in a sentence  \[12\]  , it might be preferable for such reasoning to be performed with the logical form as input rather than as output  . 
2Moore\[14\] addresses time issues , but omits future tense sentences and acknowledges problematic interactions between his event abstraction operator and time  . 

Although many researchers have proposed formalisms for simple action sentences  , very few of them have addressed the issues that arise when extending those formalisms to the more complex sentences that occur in task-oriented dialogues  . There has been work in each of the above areas , but this research as been fragmentary and still needs to be integrated with that on the logical form of action sentences  . Ironically , the conclusion that Moore arrived at , ten years ago , is still valid today \[14\]: " If real progress is to be made on understanding the logical form of natural language utterances  , it must be studied in a unified way and treated as an important research problem in its own right  . "In ray talk , I will present an initial attempto do so .
