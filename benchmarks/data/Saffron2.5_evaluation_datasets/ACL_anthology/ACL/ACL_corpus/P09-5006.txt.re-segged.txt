1 Introduction
The identification of different nominal phrases in a discourse as used to refer to the same ( discourse ) entity is essential for achieving robust natural language understanding ( NLU ). The importance of this task is directly amplified by the field of Natural Language Processing ( NLP ) currently moving towards high-level linguistic tasks requiring NLU capabilities such as e.g . recognizing textual entailment . This tutorial aims at providing the NLP community with a gentle introduction to the task of coreference resolution from both a theoretical and an application-oriented perspective . Its main purposes are : (1) to introduce a general audience of NLP researchers to the core ideas underlying state-of-the-art computational models of coreference ; (2) to provide that same audience with an overview of NLP applications which can benefit from coreference information.
2 Content Overview 1. Introduction to machine learning approaches to coreference resolution . We start by focusing on machine learning based approaches developed in the seminal works from Soon et al (2001) and Ng & Cardie (2002). We then analyze the main limitations of these approaches , i.e . their clustering of mentions from a local pairwise classification of nominal phrases in text . We finally move on to present more complex models which attempt to model coreference as a global discourse phenomenon ( Yang et al , 2003; Luo et al , 2004;
Daume ? III & Marcu , 2005, inter alia).
2. Lexical and encyclopedic knowledge for coreference resolution . Resolving anaphors to their correct antecedents requires in many cases lexical and encyclopedic knowledge . We accordingly introduce approaches which attempt to include semantic information into the coreference models from a variety of knowledge sources , e.g . WordNet ( Harabagiu et al , 2001), Wikipedia ( Ponzetto & Strube , 2006) and automatically harvested patterns ( Poesio et al , 2002; Markert &
Nissim , 2005; Yang & Su , 2007).
3. Applications and future directions . We present an overview of NLP applications which have been shown to profit from coreference information , e.g . question answering and summarization . We conclude with remarks on future work directions . These include : a ) bringing together approaches to coreference using semantic information with global discourse modeling techniques ; b ) exploring novel application scenarios which could potentially benefit from coreference resolution , e.g . relation extraction and extracting events and event chains from text.
