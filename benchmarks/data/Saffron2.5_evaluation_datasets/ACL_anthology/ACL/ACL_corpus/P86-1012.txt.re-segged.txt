PREL1 MINARIES
We study the formal and linguistic properties of a class of parenthesis-free categorial grammars derived from those of Ades and Steedman by varying the set of reduction rules  . We characterize the reduction rules capable of generating context-sensitive languages as those having a partial combination rule and a combination rule in the reverse direction  . We show that any categorial language is a permutation of some contextfree language  , thus inheriting properties dependent on symbol counting only  . We compare some of their properties with other contemporary formalisms  . 

Categorial grammars have recently been the topic of renewed interest  , stemming in part from their use as the underlying formalism in Montague grammar  . While the original categorial grammars were early shown to be equivalent to contextfree grammars  ,  1 ,  2 ,   3 modifications to the formalism have led to systems both more and less powerful than contextfree grammars  . 
Motivated by linguistic considerations , Ades and Steedman 4 introduced categorial grammars with some additional cancellation rules  . Full cancellation rules correspond to application of functions to arguments  . 
Their partial cancellation rules correspond to functional composition  . The new backward combination rule is motivated by the need to treat preposed elements  . They also modified the formalism by making category symbols parenthesis-free  , treating them in general as governed by a convention of association to the left  , but violating this convention in certain of the rules  . 
This treatment of categorial grammar suggests a family of eategorial systems  , differing in the set of cancellation rules that are allowed  . Earlier , we began a study of the mathematical properties of that family of systems  , showing that some members are fully equivalent o contextfree grammars  , while others yield only a subset of the contextfree languages  , or a superset of them . 
In this paper we continue with these investigations  . 
We characterize the rule systems that can obtain context-sensitive languages  , and compare the sets of categorial \] ar~guages with the contextfree languages  . 
Finally , we discuss the linguistic relevance of these results  , and compare categorial grammars with TAG systems i  , this regard . 
A categorial grammar under a set R of reduction rules is a quadruple CGR  ( VT , VA , S , F ) , whose elements are defined as follows : VT is a finite set of morphemes  . VA is a finite set of atomic category symbols . 
SEVA is a distinguished element of VA . To define F , we must first define CA , the set of category symbols . 
CA is given by : i ) if AEVA , then AECA ; ii ) if XEUA and AEVA , then X/AECA ; and iii ) nothing elsels in CA . F is the lexicon , a function from VT to 2 ea such that for every a EVT , F ( a ) is finite . We often write CGR to denote a categorial grammar with rule set R  , when the elements of the quadruple are known . 
Notation : Morphemes are denoted by a , b ; morpheme strings by u , v , w . The symbols S , A , B , C denote atomic category symbols , and U . V , X , Y denote arbitrary ( complex ) category symbols . Complex category symbols whose leftmost symbol is S  ( symbols " headed " by S ) are denoted by X s , Ys . Strings of category symbols are denoted by z , y . 
The language of a categorial grammar is determined in part by the set R of reduction rules  . This set can include any subset of the following five rules  . In each statement , AEVA , and
U/A , A/U , A/V , VIAECA.
(1 )   ( F Rule ) The string of category symbols U/AA can be replaced by U  . We write : U/AA---*U ;   ( 2 )   ( FP Rule ) The string U/AA/V can be replaced by U/V . We write : U/AA/V-*U/V ;   ( 3 )   ( B Rule ) The string AV/A can be replaced by U . We write : AU/A ~ U ; (4) ( BsRule ) Same as B rule , except that U is headed by S . 
(5 )   ( BP Rule ) The string A/UV/A can be replaced by V/U . We write : A/UV/A--*V/U . 
If XY --- , Z by the F-rule , X Y is called an F-redex . 
Similarly , for the other four rules . Any one one of them may simply be called a redex . 
The reduction relation determined by a subset of these rules is denoted by => and defined by : if XY --* Z by one of the rules of R  , then for any a , / ~ inCA * , aXY/3>a Z/3 . The reflexive and transitive closure of the relation -> is = >*  . A morpheme string w = wlu , ~"' w , is accepted by CGR(VT , VA , S , F ) if there is a category string z = X1X2""?X , such that XiEF(w , ) for each i = l , 2  , ' -- n , and x =>* S . The language L(CGR ) accepted by CGR(VT , VA , S , F ) is the set of all morpheme strings that are accepted  . 

I . NON-CONTEXT-FREE CATEGORIAL

In this section we present a characterization theorem for the categorial systems that generate only contextfree languages  . 
First , we introduce a lexicon FEQ that we will show has the property that for any choice R of metarules any string in L  ( CGR ) has equal numbers of a , b , and c . 
We define the lexicon FEQ as FEQ(a ) = A , FEQ(b ) = BI , F ~ Q(c ) = C/A/C/B , C/D , 
FEQ(d)D , FEQ(e ) = S/A/C/B .
We will also make use of two languages on the alphabet a  , b , e , d , eLl = a " db " ec ~ In >/1 , and LEQ = w!#a =  #b =  #c > 11 , #d =  #e=1 . 
A lemma shows that with any set R of rules the lexicon FEQ yields a subset of LEQ  . 
Lemma 1 Let G be - any categorial grammar , CGR(VT , VA , S , FEQ ) , where VT = a , b , c , d , e , VA = S , A , B , C , D , with R~F , FP , B , BP . Then
L(C)CL~Q .
Proof Let z = XIX 2 . . . X ~=>* S . Let w = wl . .  . w . be a corresponding morpheme string . To differentiate between the occurrence of a symbol as a head and otherwise  , write C/A/C/B = CA -1C-1B-1' S/A/C/B = SA-1C-1B   -1 and C/D = CD -1  . For any rule system R , are dexis two adjacent categories , the tail of one matching the head of the other , and is reduced to a single category after cancelling the matching symbols  . Since all occurrences of A must cancel to yield a reduction to S  , #A=#A-1 . This holds for all atomic categories except S , for which  #S =  #S-l + l . 
This lexicon has the property that any derivable category symbol  , either has exactly one S and is S-headed or does not have an occurrence of S  . Hence in x , #S = 1, i . e . , w has exactly one e . Let the number of occurrences in x of C/A/C/B and C/D be p and q respectively  . \] t follows that  #C = p + q,#C-1 = p + 1 . 
Hence q = 1 and wha . ~exactly oned . Each occurrence of C/A/C/B introduces one A- landB-1   . Since whas one e,#A1 = #B-J = p+1 . Hence#A = #B = p + 1 . 
Since for each A , B and C in z there must be exactly one a , b and c , #a =  #b =  #c . \[\] We show next that in the restricted ease where R contains only the two rules FP and B s  , the language L1 is obtained . 
Lemma 2 Let CGR be the categorial grammar with lexicon FEQ and rule set R = FP  , B s . Then
L(CGR ) = L1.
Proof Anyx EL1 has a unique parse of the form ( BsFP ) nBs B s ~ , and hence L1CL ( CGR ) . Conversely , any x having a parse must have exactly one e . Further , all b's and c's can appear only on the left and right of e respectively  . Any derivable category having an A has the form S  /   ( A / ) "U where U does not have any A . Thus all A's appear consecutively on the left of thee  . For the rightmoste , F(c ) = C/D . Ad must be in between a ' s and b's . By lemma 1,#(a ) = #( b ) = #( c) . Thus x = and bnec ", for some n . Hence L1 = L(CGR) . \[\] The next lemma shows that no language intermediate to  L1 and LEQ can be contextfree . It really does not involve eategorial grammar at all  . 
Lemma 3 If L1C . LC-LEQ , then L is not contextfree . 
Proof Suppose Liscontextfree . Since L contains L1 , it has arbitrarily long strings of the form a ' ~ bdb " ec "  . Let k and K be pumping lemma constants . Choose n > max(K , k) . This string , if pumped , yields a string not in LEQ , hence we have a contradiction . 

Corollary Let FP , Bs ~ R . Then there is a non-context-free language L ( CGR )  . 
Proof Use the lexicon FEQ . Then by lemma1 L(CGR ) ~ LEQ . But FP , Bs ~ R , so LI ~ L(CGR) . \[\] The following theorem summarizes the results by characterizing the rule sets that can be used to generate context sensitive languages  . 
Main Theorem A categorial system with ruleset R can generate a context-sensitive language if and only if R contains a partial combination rule and a combination rule in the reverse direction  . 
Proof The " if " part follows for FP , Bs by lemmas1 ,  2 , and 3 . It follows for BP , F by symmetry . For the " only if " part , first note that any unidirectional system ( system with rules that are all forward , or all backward ) can generate only contextfree languages . 5 The only remaining cases are F , B and FP , BP 1 . The first generates only contextfree languages . 5 The second generates only the empty language , since no atomic symbol can be derived using only these two rules  . 
II . CATEGORIALL ANGUAGES AREPERMUTA-
TIONSOF CONTEXT-FREEL ANGUAGES
Let VT = al , a2"- . , ak . A Parikh mapping 6 v / is a mapping from morpheme strings to vectors such that x ~  ( w )  =  (  #al ,  #a2 .   .   .   .   .  #ak ) . u is a permutation of v iff ~( u ) = ~( v ) . Let ~ P ( L~=W ( w ) Iw EL , A language L is a permutation of L iff ~ ( L ) = xC ( L )  . We define a rotation as follows . In the parse tree for uEL , at any node corresponding to a Bredex or BP- red exex change its left and right subtrees  , obtaining an F-redex or an FP-redex . Let v the resulting terminal string . We say that u has been transformed into v by rotation  . 
We now obtain results that are helpful in showing that certain language seannol be generated by  . categorial grammars . First we show that , every categorial language is a permutation of a contextfree language  . This will enable us to show that properties of contextfree languages that depend only on the symbol counts must also hold of categorial languages  . 
Theorem Let Rc : F , FP , B , BP . Then there exists a LCF such that ? ( L ( CGR ) ) = ? ( LcF )   , where LcF is contextfree . 
ProofLet xeL(CGR) . In its parse tree at each node corresponding to a B-redex or a BP-red experform a rotation  , so that it becomes a F-redex or a FP-redex . 
Since the transformed string y is obtained by rearranging the parse tree  , xt , ( x ) = ~( y) . Also y derivable using RI = FP , F only . Hence the set of such y obtained as a permutation of some x is the same as L  ( CGRt )  , which is contextfree , 5 i . e . , L(CGRI ) = LCF . \[\] semilinear , Parikh bounded and has the linear growth property . 
Semilinearity follows from Parikh's Lemma and linear growth from the pumping lemma for contextfree languages  . Parikh boundedness follows from the fact that any contextfree language is Parikh bounded  .   6   I1 Proposition Anyone -- symbol categorial grammar is regular  . 
Note that if L is a semilinear subset of nonnegative integers  , an Ine Lisregular . 
III . NON-CATEGORIAL LANG UAGES
We now exhibit some non-categorial languages and compare eategorial languages with others  . From the corollary of the previousection we have the following results  . 
Theorem Categorial languages are properly contained in the context-sensitive languages  . 
Proof The languages a h(n)\[n > /0 , where h ( n ) = n2 or h ( n ) = 2" which do not have linear growth rate , are not generated by any CGR . These are context sensitive . Also a rab " I either m > n , grinis prime and n ~< m and misprime is not semilinear  7 and hence not categorial . 
It is interesting to note that lexieal functional grammar can generate the first two languages mentioned above  8 and indexed languages can generate a nbn2a ~' In > tl . 
Linguistic Properties
We now look at some languages that exhibit cross -serial dependencies  . 
Let G3 be the CGR with R = FP , Bs,
VT = a , b , c , d , and with the lexicon FFI~I = IS~S1'=SlIB/S1 , F ( c ) = S1'B . F ( a ) = lS1/a/sl , m , Then L3 = L(G3) = wcd wtwEa , b * . The reasoning is similar to that of lemma 1 . First  #c =  #d = 1, from  #S = 1 . Since we have Bs rule , c occurs on the left of d and all occurrences of a and b on the left of c get assigned A and B respectively  . Similarly all a and b on the right of c , get assigned to the complex category as defined by F  . It follows that all symbols to the right of dget combined by FP rule and those on the left by Bs rule  . Hence a symbol occurring n symbols to the right of d must be matched by an occurrence n symbols to the right of the leftmost symbol  . 
For any k , let G4(k ) be the CGR with
R = FP , Bs again , VT = al , hi \] 1 < ~ i ~ kUciI1 ~< i < kOd , e , and the lexicon F ( b , ) = s , / ai/s , , F(al ) =\[ A , ,l <~ i <~ k , F ( e , ) = S , /S , +I , I < i < k , F ( d ) = Sk , 
F ( e ) = S/S a . Then
L(G ,   ( k )   ) = lal " ~ a2   "2 - - - a ~" k debl "' cx ' ek - ~ bk " kJ for any k . Note that #Ai =  #Ai-a . This implies  #bi =  #ai . The rest of the argument parallels that for L3 above . Thus FP , Bs has the power to express unbounded cross -serial dependencies  . 
Now we can compare with Tree Adjoining Grammars ( TAG )  . sATAG without local constraints cannot generate  L3  . A TAG with local constraints can generate this , but it cannot generate L 6= amb " cmd "\] m , n > -1 . L4 ( 2 ) can be transformed into L6 by the homomorphismer asing ca , d and e . TAG languages are closed under homomorphisms and thus the categorial anguage  L4  ( 2 ) is not a TAG language . TAG languages exhibit only limited cross serial dependencies  . Thus , though TAG Languages and CG language share some properties like linear growth  , semilinearity , generation of all contextfree languages , limited context sensitive power , and Parikh boundedness , they are different in their generative capacities .
