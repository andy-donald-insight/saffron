according to this definition 2 . Each elementary tree is constrained to have at least one terminal at its frontier which serves as ' head '  ( or ' anchor ' )  . 
Sentences of a Tag language are derived from the composition of an S-rooted initial tree with other elementary trees by two operations : substitution  ( the same operation used by contextfree grammars ) or adjunction , which is more powerful . 
Taking examples from English and French idioms , this paper shows that not only constituent structures rules but also most syntactic rules  ( such as topicalization , wh-question , pronominalization . . . ) are subject to lexical constraints ( on top of syntactic , and possibly semantic , ones ) . We show that such puzzling phenomenare naturally handled in a ' lexJcalized ' formalism such as Tree Adjoining Grammar  . The extende domain of locality of TAGs also allows one to ' lexicalize ' syntactic rules while defining them at the level of constituents ructures  . 
1 INTRODUCTIONTO'LEXICALIZED '
GRAMMARS 1 . 1 Lexicalizing Phrase Structure rules In most current linguistic theories the information put in the lexicon has been increased in both amount and complexity  . Viewing constituent structures as projected from the lexicon for example avoids the often noted redundancy between Phrase Structure rules and subcategorization frames  . Lexical constraints on the wellformedness of linguistic outputs has also simplified the previous transformational machinery  . 
Collapsing phrase-structure rules into the lexicon is the overt purpose of '  lexicali7ed ' grammars as defmed by Schabes , Abeill 6 , Joshi 1988 : a ' lexicallzed'grammar consists of afmite set of elementary structures  , each of which is systematically associated with one  ( or more ) lexical item serving as ' head ' . These structures are combined with one another with one or more combining operation  ( s )  . These structure specify extende domains of locality  ( as compared to CFGs ) over which lexical constraints can be stated . The ' grammar'consists of a lexicon where each lexical item is associated with a finite number of structures for which that item is the ' head '  . 
We here assume familiarity with Tree Adjoin ing Grammars  , which are naturally ' lexicalized '* The author wants to thank Yves Schabes  , Aravind Joshi , Maurice Gro ~ , Sharon Cote and Tilman Becker for fruitful discussions  , and Robert Giannasi and Beatrice Santorini for their help  . 
Schabes , Abeill ~ , Jo~hl 1988 show that contextfree grammars cannot in general be lexicalized  ( using substitution only as the combining operation  )  . They also show that lexicalized grammars are interesting from a computational point of view since lexicalization simplifies parsing techniques  , because the parser uses only a relevant subset of the entire grammar : in a first stage  , the parser selects a set of elementary structures associated with the lexical items in the input sentence  , and in a second stage the sentence is parsed with respect o this set  . As shown by Schabes , Joshi 1989 , a parser's performances are thus improved . 
We show here that such ' lexicalization ' should be extended to other components of the grammar as well  , thus challenging the usual distinction between ' lexical ' and ' syntactic ' rules  . Further parsing simplification is therefore xpected  . 
1.2' Lexicalizing ' lexicai rules
As has often been noticed , rules ( or transitivity alternations ) such as passive , particle hopping , middle , dative-shift . . . are subject to lexical idiosyncrasies . There are of course syntactic and semantic on straints governing such phenomena  , but lexical ones seem to beats take to . 
If one considers double objects constructions , passivation of the second NP is regularly ruled out on syntactic grounds  . Passivation of the first NP , on the other hand is subject to lexical restrictions as the example of ' cost '  , opposed to ' envy ' or's pare ' , shows :
Theyenvy Johnhis new car.
John is envied his new car.
The mistake cost Mary a chance to win.
?* Mary was cost a chance to win.
The judge kindly spared John the ordeal.
John was kindly spared the ordeal.
One might argue that such differences may be due to some semantic on straints  , but even verbs with similar meaning may exhibit striking differences  . For example , in French , ' regarder ' in 292   2 Categorial grammars are also ' lexicalized ' . 
its figurative read in ? ( to concern ) and ' concerner ' , which is a true synonym in this context , behave differently : . 
Cetteaffaire regarde Jean * Jeanest regard6 parcet teaf faire
Cetteaffaire concerne Jan
Jeanest conceru ~ parcet teaf faire(M . Gross 1975 ) It also seems a lexical phenomenon that " change " but not " transform " allows for ergative alternation in English ' The witch changed /transformed John into a wolf 
John changed into a wolf * John transformed into a wolf  ( G . Lakoff 1970) To take another example , dative shift ( or the re-insertion ) is often thought of as applying to a semantically restricted set of verbs  ( eg verbs of communication or of change of possession  , for dative ) , but this does not predic the difference between ' tell ' that allows for it  , and ' announce ' or ' explain ' which do not 3:
John told his ideas to Mary
Johntold Mary his ideas
John explained his ideas to Mary * John explained Mary his ideas Lexicalist framework such as GPSG  , which handle such phenomena by metarules ( defined on ' lexical ' PS rules )  , or LFG , which defmes them at the f-structure lvel ( ie between ' lexical forms ' ) could capture such restrictions . D . Flickin?er 1987 handles them explicitly with a hierarchical lexicon in HPSG  , considering such rules to hold between two word classes  ( verbs here ) and to apply by default unless they are explicitly blocked in the lexicon  . 
But all these representations rely on a clearcut distinction between lexical and syntactic rules and it is not clear how they could be extended to the latter  . 
2 LEXICAL CONSTRAINT SON SYNTACTIC

The distinction between ' syntactic'rules 4 that do not usually change argument structure nor  3 To dismiss ' announce ' or ' explain ' on the mere basis of their latin origin would not do  , since ' offer ' , which comes from latin as well , does exhibit dative shift . 
4Wcuse the term ' rule ' for conveniency . It does not matter for our pu ~ , whether these phenomena are captured by meaning of the sentence and are supposed to apply regularly on syntactic structures  , and ' lexical ' rules that alter argument structure  , may change the meaning of the predicate and may exhibit some lexical idiosyncrasies  , usually overlooks the fact that both are subject olexical constraints  . 
There has often been discussions about whether certain rules  ,   ( eg passive or extraposition ) should be considered of one kind or the other . But it has seldom been realized , to the best of our knowledge , how often ' syntactic ' rules are prevented to apply on what seems purely lexical  grounds5  . 
Our discussion crucially relies on idiomatic or semi-idiomatic constructions  . We believe that a sizable grammar of natural anguage  , as well as any realistic natural language application  , cannot ignore them , since their frequency is quite high in real texts  ( M . Gross 1989) . We first present examples of such lexical constraints on topicalization  , pronomi ~ ali Tation and wh-question for both English and French idioms  . We then show that similar constraints can be found in nonidiomatic sentences  . 
2 . 1 Flexibility of idiomatic constructions Idioms are usually divided into two sets  ( egJ . 
Bresnan 1982, T . Wasow et al 1982 ) :' fL xed'ones ( not subject to any syntactic rule ) and flexible ones ( presumably subject o all )  . However , there is quite a continuum between both . 
Let us take two French idioms usually considered as " fixed':'casserlacroflte '  ( to have a bite ) and ' demanderial une ' ( to ask for the impossible )  . It is true that passivation or wh-question do not apply to either  . But pronominalization for the former , cleft-extraction ( c'est que ) for the latter do 6: Paula cassela crotite ( Paul had a bite )  #Quelle crofite casse-t-il ? #C'estune petite cro0te qu'ila cassee . 
derivation rules as such or by constraints on the wellformedness of ou~ut structures  . 
5 An interesting exception being Kaplan and Zaenen  1989's proposal that wh-movement and topicalization be constrained at the f-structure level  , ie by LFG's ' lexical forms ' . 
6 # marks that the sentence is not possible with the desired idiomatic interpretation  . There may be some variations among speakers about acceptability judgements on such sentences  ( and on some of the following ones )  . Such variability is indeed a property of lexical phenomena  . 
2 93 ? Paulestentrain de casser une pet ite cro~t et j ' en casser a is bienune anssi  . ( Paul is having a little bite , I wouldn't mind having one too )
Jeanne deman de lalune  #Ou elle lune deman de-t - elle ? 
C'est lalune qu ' clle demande ! #Jeanne deman de lalune et Paulela deman de aussi  .   ( Jeanne is ask in ~ for the moon and i ' masking for it too  ) These idioms are thus not completely fixed ( as opposed to idioms such as ' cassers apipe ' or ' kick the bucket '  )  , and some grammatical function must be assigned to their frozen NPs  . But the differences among them are somewhat unexpected : ' casserla cro~te '  ( where the noun can be modified and take several determiners  ) does not allow for more rules than ' demander la lune '  ( where the frozen NP is completely fixed )  . 
If one now takes an idiom usually considered as flexible  , ' briser laglace ' ( to break the ice ) , which does passivize , we notice the same distribution as with ' casser lacr of  , e':
Paula bris6 laglace#Ouelleglacea-t-il bris6e ? #C'est laglace qu'il brise 77 Jeana bris6 laglace hieretc'est ~ moidelabriseraujourd ' hul  .   ( Paul broke the ice yesterday and I have to break it today  ) Passive is allowed but not wh-question , norcleft extraction . It is difficult to dismiss such phenomena as rare exceptions  . Looking at numerous idioms shows that one combination of such rules is not more frequent than the other  . It is also difficult to fredaclear semantic principle at work here  . 
Similar restriction seem to be at work in English . If one takes some English idioms usually considered as ' flexible '  ( or even not idiomatic at all ) : NP0 give hell/the boot to NP1 . The main verb ' give ' seems to behave syntactically and semantically as in non idiomatic constructions : Dative shift applies and we have the regular semantic alternation :  NP1 get hell/the boot ( from NP0 )  , with identical meaning . But it is not the case that all expecterules apply : passive is blocked  , pronominalization the object oo :  #Hell was given to Mary  ( by John )  #The boot was given to Mary ( by John )  #Alice gave hell to Paul yesterday and she is giving it to Oscar now  . 
 #Oscar gave the boot to Mary , and he will give it to Bob too . 

Syntactic rules may also apply differently to distinct'flexible'idioms  . It is easy to lindidioms which do passivize but don't allow for pronominaliTation r topicaliTation in the same way: 
They hit the bull's eye.
The bull'seye , they hit.
? John hit the bull'seye and Paul hit it too.
They buried the hatchet.
77 The hatchet , heyburied.
 #John buried the hatchet and Paul buried it/one too  . 
For relativation also , there might be similar differences : The strings that Chr is pulled helped hime get the job  ( Wasow et al 1982 )  #The bull'seye that John hit helped himget the job  . 
 #The hatchet that he buried helped himget the job  . 
Distinguishing between fixed and flexible idioms is thus not sufficient  . Because different rules apply to them differently  , without a clear hierarchy ( contrary to Fraser 1970 )  , one should distinguish as many different types of flexibility as there are possible combinations of such rules  . 
Similarly , if one wants to follow T . Wasow et al 1982 's suggestion that some kind of compositional semantics should be held responsible for the syntactic flexibility of idioms  , as many degrees of compositionality should be defined as there are combinations of syntactic properties  . Direct encoding of the latter is thus preferable , and such a semantic'detour ' does not seem to help  . 
This does not mean that no regularities could be found for idioms ' syntax but that they have to be investigated at a more lexical evel  . 
2 . 2 Some lexical constraints on non Idiomatic constructions Going back to nonidiomatic on structions  , it seems that their syntactic properties may be subject to similar lexical idiosyncrasies  . 
If one considers double objects constructions , It seems a lexical phenomenon that wh-question on the second N-P is allowed with ' give ' or ' spare '  , and not with ' envy ' or ' cost ' , and that topicalization is allowed with's pare ' only: 
Theyenvy Johnhis new car * What /* Which cardo theyen vy John  7 * This brand new car , everyone envies John
The mistake cost Mary a chance to win * What /* Which chance did the mistake cost 
Mary ?* This unique chance , the mistake cost Mary
The judge's pared John the ordeal
What/Which or deal did the judges pare John ? This or deal  , the judge kindly spared John If one now considers the first NP  , topic Mi-ation appfies differently to : * Mary , the mistake cost a chance to win . 9 John , you have always envied his extraordinary luck John  , the judge kindly spared the ordeal In French , as noted by M . Gross 1969 , properties usually thought of as applying to a Ll ' direct objects '  ( passivation , Que-question and Le-cliticizatlon ) may apply in fact unpredicting iy . 
Although the objects of a verb like ' almer ' ( love ) take objects undergoing the three of them , the object of ' valoir ' ( be worth ) only allows for Que-question and Lc-?llti ? i TagiOiX  , that of ' co ~\] tter ' ( cost ) only for Que-quesfion and that of ' passer ' ( spend ( time ) ) only allows for Le-cliticization : Each elementary tree in a Tag is lexicalized in the sense that it is headed by  ( at least ) one lexical item . The category of a word in the lexicon is the name of the tree it selects  . We only consider here sentential trees for the sake of simpficity  . 
What lexical heads select is in fact a set of such elementary trees called a " Tree Family ~  ( Abeill ~1988 , Abeill ~ et al 1990) , each tree correspond ln ~ to a certain constituent sructure  ( initial trees for wh-questions , auxiliary trees for relative clauses . . . ) . This is the level at which syntactic gener MiTJ tions can be stated  , since each elementary tree may bear specific on straints independantly of any iexical items B  . A Tree Family consists in fact of all the constituent structures trees which are possibly allowed for a given predicate  9  . 
Examples of trees in then 0 Vnl Family ( verbs taking two NP arguments ) are the follow lngl0:

These differences are all the more surpri ~ in ? that ' cofiter ' and ' valoir ' are otherwise very dose verbs  ( same subcategorization frames , ~meselectional restrictions ) . 
Looking for some generalization principles with which to predict such restriction should be pursued  , but it seems that they will be of a lexl calk in d .

I8 Further subdividing these Tree Families , similarly to M . 
Gross 1975's verb tables for French , and to D . Flickinger 1987' swcqrd classes for English , will help reduce the number of features , and thus the amount of seemingly idiot ~ cratic information  , associated with each verb . However , as noted by both authors , lexical idioayncrasies will never be eliminated altogether  . 
9 Tree Family names ( nOV , nOV nl . . . ) are somewhat similar to ' lexical forms ' in LFG in the sense that they capture both the predicate argument structure and the associated grammatical functions  ( which we note by indices : 0 for subject , l for first object . . . ) . Notice that the Tree Family name does not change when lexical rules apply  . 
10 ~ marks a substitution node , 0 marks the head . We use here standard TAG trees for commodity of extx ~ tion  , although recent independent linguistic work suggests to slightly modify them  , challenging for example the distinction between VP and V levels  ( see Abeill ~ , in preparation ) . 
Each tree is identified by a Tree family name associated to a feature bundle correspond in ~ to the rules it involves  . For example , a2 , a3 and a4 are respectively marked 11: al ( nOV nl ) a2 ( nOV nl ) passive f-passive =+
Wh-0---Wh-1---
Wh-1---Wh-0ffi-erg=-a3 ( n0V nl ) a4 ( n0V nl ) passive=-passiveffi +
Wh-l=-Wh-1=+erg=+Wh-O=-
A given tree can belong to several tree families at the same time  , which helps factorizing the grammar in a parsing perspective  . For example ,   a3 can also be considered as belon ~ n ~ to then OV Family  ( for verbs with one NI ' argument ) with a different feature bundle : passive = - ; Wh-0=- . The lexical items head in ~ the tree constrain ~ its interpretation  , eg'sleep ' will interpret a3 as nOV , while ' bake ' or ' walk ' interpretitasn 0 Vnl . 
Lexical constraints on syntactic and lexical rules are handled by having the head select its own subset of trees in its tree family  . 
For example , ' resemble'selects only active trees ; ' rumored ' only passive ones , and ' love'select both 12: . 
\[love\] , V:n0 Vnl\[erg=-\]\[resemble\] , V:n0Vnl\[passive=-;erg=-\]\[rumored\] , V : n0Vnl\[part , lye=+\]\[donate\] , V ; to , P:n0VPnl\[dative=-;erg=-\]\[give\] , V;to , P:n0VPnl\[erg=-\]\[spare\] , V :n0Vnln2 These features work as follows : when nothing is said about a feature  , it means that the predicate selects trees with the feature being plus of minus  ; 11One might explicitly define mate rules , or links between such trees : a passive rule for example  , changes the feature passive of the tree and intervert the features bearing on NO and  N1  . Work is being curretly done along this line with T  . 
Becket , Y . Schabes and K . Vijay Shanker.
1 2 We note with square \[ I the set of inflected forms of a lexical item  . For example ,\[10ve\]=give,g ~ . s , gave , giving . 
given . We use a restriction principle to rule outer g = + whenever passive =+  ( or dativ ~=+ )  , and vicevemh to the ergative feature does not have to appear in the lexicon for ' rumored '  . 
when a feature is marked plus , it means that only trees with this feature plus are selected  ( ie that the corresponding rule is ' forced ' to apply  )  . 
Such ' lexicallzation ' of syntactic rules applies similarly in idiomatic and nonidiomatic constructions  . 
3.2 Idioms in a Lexlcalized Tree Adjoining

Tags seem a natural framework to represent structures which at the same time are semantically noncompositional and should be assigned regular syntactic structures  ( Abeill 6 and Schabes 1989 ,  1990) . Idioms are thus made fall into the same grammar as nonidiomatic coustructious  . The only specificity of idioms is that they are selected by a multicomponent head  ( called ' anchor ' ) and may select elementary trees which are more extended than nonidiomatic constructions  . Here are some examples of elementary trees for ' kick the bucket '  , ' bury the hatchet ' and ' take NI ' into account ':

The lexical anchors are respectively'kick ' , " the ' and " bucket ' for (1 , ' bury ' , ' the ' and ' hatchet ' for ?2 , and ' take ' , ' into ' and ' account ' for , t3 .

NP a\[John \] ( 1 ) literal derivation idiomatic derivation Idiomatic and nonidiomatic elementary trees are gathered into tree families according to the same principles  . Here are some examples of the trees belonging to the Family of idioms with a frozen object  ( nOVDN 1 ) :

\[prendre\] , V;ie , D;temps , N : DN0Vnll passive=+\]\[piquer\] , V;mouche , N : NO Vnl\[Wh . N 0 =+\] Notice that the tree familiy name tells not only about the argument structure but also about the head being multicomponent or not  ( all head elements are noted with capital letter )  . Usually , no part of a multicomponent head can be omitted , and trees that are possible for this argument structure but in which all head elements could not be inserted will be ruled out  . 
For example , what-questions ( noted Wh-i ) are generally disallowed with frozen nominals ( and thus not noted for each iexical entry )  , whereas questions with wh-determiners ( noted Wh-Ni ) are not:
John took a trip to Spain  #What did John take ?? Which triptoSpain did John take ?  ( Abe Rl 6et at . 1990) In fact , as has been noted by M . Gross 1989 for French , Wh-Ni questions seem to be ruled out when the determiner of the argument is completely fixed  , as the following contrasts show: . 
John spilled the/those beans
John buried the/#thi ~/ #ahtchet
Which be an ( s ) did Johnspill ?  #Which hatchet did Johnbury ? Similarly  , idioms bear syntactic features constrain ln ? the elementary trees of the TreeFamily they select  . In then 0 V DN 1 Tree Family , for e~mmple , ' kick the bucket's elects only al , and the trees corresponding to wh-movement on NO ; ' bury the hatchet's elects also the trees for passive  ( and possibly topic ~ liT . ' ation on N1) . 
\[bury\] , V;the , D;hatchet , N : n0VDN1\[Wh-N1-\]\[kick\] , V;the , D;bucket , N : n0VDN1\[passive=-;
Wh-N1=-; Top-N1=-\]
This generalization which can be captured since the Tree family names will be different  ( with D for frozen determiners , and d for not frozen ones ):\[ spill\] , V ;\[ be un\] , N : n0V dN1\[bury\] , V ; the , D ; hatchet , N : n0VDN1 The trees for the Wh-N questions will thus belong only to the corresponding ' d'F amilies  , and not to the ' D ' ones . 

There are some idioms which exist only in the passive form  , or in the question form , and the correspond ; no trees are directly selected . In French , " ~ trepris parl et emps " ( to be very busy ) lacks its active counterpart ( * Let emps prend Jean )  , and " Quelle moucheapiqe 6 NP ?" ( What's eating NP ? ) lacks its noninterrogative 13 " l'he derived trees are the same ( modulo the syntactic features explained above )  . 

It has been shown that takl no , idiomatic or semi-idiomatic onstructions into account in a French or Enali ~ grammar forces one to define some lexical constraints on syntactic rules such as wh-question  , pronominaliTation and topicalization . 
Such a lexical treatment has been exemplified using Lexicalized Tree Adjoining grammars  . An interest lnopoint about TAGs is that , due to their extende domain of locality , they enable one to consider as ' lexicar syntactic rules bearing on constituent structures  , and not only rules changing the syntactic ategory of a predicate  ( as D . Dowry 1978) or rules chan # , ~ the argument structure of a predicate ( as in T . Wasow 1977 or
D . Flickinger 1987).
