In a text-produqtion system high and special demands are placed on the grammar and the lexicon  . This paper will view these comDonents in such a system  ( overview in section 1 )  . First , the subcomponent edealing with semantic information and with syntactic information will be presenteds e !: arataly  ( section 2 )  . The probtems of relating these two types of information are then identified  ( section 3 )  . Finally , strategies designed to meet the problems are proDose ? l and discussed  ( section 4 )  . 
One of the issues that will be illustrated is what happens when a systemic linguistic approach is combined with a Kt  . .ONE like knowledge representation ? a novel and hither to unexplored combination \]  1  . THE PLA CE OF AGR AMM AR AND A
LEXICONINPENMAN
This gaper will view a grammar and a lexicon as integral parts of a text production system  ( PENMAN )  . This perspective leads to certain recluirements on the form of the grammar and that of the eubparts of the lexicon and on the strategies for integrating these components with each other and with other parts of the system  . In the course of the I~resents tion of the component S  , the subcom Donents and the integrating strategies , these requirements will be addressed . Here I will give a brief overview of the system . 
PENMAN is a successor tOKDS(\[12\] , \[14\] and\[13\] ) and is being created to produce muiti . sentential natural English text , It has as some of its component Sa knowledge domain  , encoded in a KL . ONE like representation , a reader model , a text-planner , a lexicon , end a Sentence generator ( called NIGEL ) . The grammar used in NIGEL is a Systemic Grammar of English of the type develol : ~ d by Michael Halliday ?- see below for references  . 
For present DurOoses the grammar , the lexic , n and their environment can be represented as shown in Figure  1  . 
The lines enclose set S ; the boxes are the linguistic compenents . The dotted lines represent parts that have been develoDed independently of the I~'esent project  , but which are being implemented , refined and revised , and the continuous lines represent components whose designill being developed within the project  . 
The box labeled syntax stands for syntactic information  , both of the general kind that iS needed to generate structures  ( the grammar ;  , the left part of the box ) and of the more Sl~=cifickind that is needed for the syntactic definition of lexical items  ( the syntactic subentry of lexical items ; to the right in the box--the term lexicogrammar can also be uasd to denote both ends of the box  )  .

Figure 1.1: System overview.
The other box ( semamics ) represents that part of semantics that has to do with our conceptualiz  . ~ tiono : experience ( distinct from the semantics of interaction - . speech acts stc , . - and the semantics of presentation -- theme structure  , the distinction between given and new information etc  . ) . It is shown as one part of what is called conceDtuals  . .
our general conceptual organization of the world around us and our own inner world  ; it is the linguistic parto ! conceptuals . For the lexicon this means that lexical semantics is that part of conceptuals which has become laxicalized and thus enters into the structure of the vocabulary  . 
There is also a correlation between conceptual organization and the organization of part of the grammar  . 
The double arrow between the two boxes represents the mapping  ( realization or encoding ) of semantics into syntax . For example , the concept SELL is mapped onto the verbs old ? The grammar is the general Dart of the syntactic box  , the part concerned with syntactic structures .

This figure , then , represents the i ~ art of the PENMAN text production system that includes the grammar  , the lexicon and their immediate environment . 
PENMAN is at the design stage ; conse?l Uantiy the discuss in n that follows is tentative end exploratory rather than definitive  . -- The ? om != on an that has advanced the farthest is the grammar  . It has been implemented in NIGEL , the santonee generator mentioned above . It has been tested and is currently being revised and extended  . None of the other components ( those demarcated by continuous lines ) have been implemented ; they have been tested only by way of hand examples  . 
This groat will concentrate on the design features of the grammar rather than on the results of the implementation and testing of it  . 
2 . THE COMPONENTS 2 . 1 . Knowledge representation and semantics
The knowledge representation
One of the fundamental properties of the KL-ONE like knowledge representation  ( KR ) is its intensional--extensional distinction , the distinction between a general conceptual taxonomy and a second part of the representation where we find individuals which can exist  , states of affairs which may be true etc . This is roughly a disbnction t : ~ ltween what is conceptuaiiza Dle and actual conceptualizations  ( whether they are real or hypothetical )  . In the overview figure in section 1 , the two are together called conceptuals . 
For instance , to use an example I will be using throughouth is paper  , there is an inteflsional concept SELL , about which no existence ' Dor location in time is claimed  . An intenalonal concept is related to extensional concede by the relation Inclividuates : intenaion ai SELL is related by individual instances of extensional SELLs by the Individuates relation  . If Iknow that Joans old Arthurice cream in the I ~! rk  , I haves SELL fixed in time which is part of an assertion about Joan and it Indiviluates intenaional SELL  .   4 A concept has internal structure : it is a configuration of roles  . The concept SELL has an internal ~ rewhich is the three roles associated with it  , viz . AGENT ( the seller) , RECIPIENT ( the buyer ) and OBJECT . These role e are slot3 which are filled by other concepts and the domains over which these can very are defined as value restrictions  . The AGENT of SELL is a PERSON or a
FRANCHISE and sOon.
tn  ~ , ther words , a ? once l~t is defined by its relation to other concepts  ( much a S in European structura i is m )  . These relations are roles a'~sociated with the concept  , roles whose fillers are other concept ? This gives rise to a large conceptual net  . 
There is another reiation which helps define the place of a conoe=t in the conceptual net  . viz . Super Category , which gives the conceptual net a taxonomic ( or hierarchic ) structure in addition to the structure defined by the role relations  . The concept SELLie defined by its I~lace in the taxonomy by having TRANSACTION as a SuperCate < jory  . If we want to , 4It ~ toul?lbeeml)t ~ ull z41~t~tltr . ~lltng the cof ~- . eotSELL'u=y~lnothing wt'~lt=oe~t~rli ~ out ~ ngli ~ t texl ~' qm ~ on for it :  . ~ e *' el . ' lonsforgz ~ it filial ~ IreI ~ urely fR~mo~i ? . 
o ~ ty way the conces = telm be I ~ ocmted ~ m~~~=o / o ' is tlw ~ gf ~ ~ g ~ of I we can define a conceot that will have SELL as a SuDerCatego q  ( i . e . 
bear the SuperCategory relation to SELL ) , for example SELLCB'sell on the black market' . As a result , p ) art of the taxonomy of events is
TRANSACTION---SELL.--SELLOB.
If TRANSACTION has a set of roles associated with it  , this set may be inherited by SELL and by SELLOB . -this is a genera J feature of the Super Category relation  . In the examples involving SELL that follow , I will concentrate on this concept and not try to generalize to its supercate gones  . 
The Semantic Subentry
In the overview figure (1 . 1) , the semantics is shown as part of the concaptua is -The consequence of this is that the set of semantic entries in the lexicon is a subset of the set of concepts  . The subset is groper if we assume that there are concepts which have not been lexicaiized  ( the assumption indicated in the figure )  . The a . csumption is I ~ erfect Jy reasonable ; I have already invented the concept SELLOB for which there is no word in standard English : it is not surprising if we have formed concepts for which we have to create expressions rather than pick the mreedy  . made from our lexicon . Furthermore , if we construct a conceptual component intended to support say a bilingual speaker  , there will be a number of concepts which are lexicaiized in only one of the two languages  . .
A semantic entry , than , is a concept in the conceptua is-For sold , we find so il wiffi its associated roles , AGENT , RECIPIENT and OBJECT . 
The right ~ of figure 4 . 1 below ( marked " se : ' ; after a figure from \[1\] gives a more detailed semanticent ~ for sold := pointer identifies the relevant part in the KR  , the concept that constitutes the semantic entry ( here the concept SELL )  . 
The concept that constitutes the semantic entry of a lexicai item has a fairly rich structure  . Roles are associated " with the concept and the modailty  ( neces ~ ury or optional )  , the ? ardinaii ~ of and restrictions on ( value of ) the fillers are given . 
Through the value restriction the linguistic notion of selection restriction is captured  . The stone sold a carnation to the little girl is odd because the AGENT role of SELL is value restricted to PERSON or FRANCHISE and the concept associated with stone fails into neither type  . 
The strategy of letting semantic entries be part of the knowledge representation would not have been possible in a notation designed to csgture specific propositions only  , However , since KL-ONEp foviles the distinction between intension and extension  , the strategy is unl = rotolsmati ? in the I = resant framework  . 
So what is the relationship between intensional -extension ai and s~manti ? entries ? The working a esumption is that for a large part of the " vocaioulary  , it is the concepts of the intanal on ai part of the KR that may be lexicalized and thus serve as semantic entries  . We have words for intenal on ai obje ? = , actions and states , but not for indt viluai extension alobiects etc . with the exception of propel names . They have extensional concepts as their semantic entries  . For instance , Alex denotes a particular individuated person and The War of the Roses a palrticula ? individumed war  . 
Both the Sul~H ' Category relation and the Indiviluates relation provide ways of walking around in the KR to find expresmons for concepts  . If individual , w ~ can follow the Individuates link up to an intensional concept  . There may be a word for it , in which case the concept is part of a laxical entry  . If there is no word for the concept , we will have to consider the various options the grammar gives us for forming an ? o Propriate exoressJon  . 
The general assumption is that all the intensional vocabulary can he used for extensional concepts in the way just describe  ( l : exc ) reasabi . .,'y is inherited with the Individuates relation . 
Expression candidates for concepts can also be located along the SuberCate  ( Jory link by going from one concept to another one higher up in the taxonomy  . Consider the following example : Joans old Arthur ice  . cream . The transaction took place in tl~eperk . The SuperCate ~ ory link enables us to go from SELL to TRANSACTION  , where we find the expression transaction . 
Lexical Semantic Relations
The structure of the vocabulary is parasitic on the conceptual structure  . 
In other words , laxicalized concepts are related not only to one another  , but also to concepts for which there is no word , encoding in English ( i . e . 
non-laxicalized concepts).
Crudely , the semantic structure of the lexicon can be described as being part of the hierarchy of intensional concepts -- the intensional concepts that happen to be lexicalized in English  . -- The structure of English vocabulary is thus not the only principle that is reflected in the knowledge representation  , but it is reflected . Very general concepts like OBJECT , THING and ACTION are at the top . In this hierarchy , roles are inherited . This corresponds to the semantic redundancy rules of a lexicon  . 
Considering the possibility of walking around in the KR and the integration of texicalized and non  . iexicalized concepts , the KR suggests itself as the natural place to state certain text-forming principles  , some of which have been described under the terms lexical cohesion  ( \[8\] ) and Thematic Progression ( \[6\] )  . 
I will now turn to the syntactic component in figure  11  , starting with a brief introduction to the framework  ( Systemic Linguistics ) that does the same for that component as the notion of semantic net did for the component just discussed  . 
2,2. Lexicogrammar
Systemic Linguistic ~ stems from a British tradition and has been developed by its founder  , Michael Halliday ( e . g .  \[7\] ,  \[9\] , \[10\]) and other systemic linguists ( see e . g .  \[5\] ,   \[4\] for Spresentation of Fawcett's interesting work on developing a systemic model within a cognitive model  ) for overtwenty years covering many areas of linguistic concern  , including studies of text , ; exicogrammar , language development , and computational applications . System ic Grammar was used in SHRDLU \[15\] and more recently in another important contribution  , Davey ' a
PROTEUS\[3\].
The systemic tradition recognizes a fundamental principle in the organization of language : the distinction between cl~oice and the structures that express  ( realize ) choices . Choice is taken as primary and is given special recC  , ;\]nition in the formalization of the systemic model of language  . Consequently , a description is a specification of the choices a speaker can make together with statement :  ; about how he realizes a selection he has made . This realization of a set of choices is typically linear  , e . g . a string of words . Each choice point is formalized as a , system ( hence the name Systemic ) . The options open to the speaker are two or more features that constitute alternatives which can ' be chosen  . The preconditions for the choice are entry conciition a to the system  . Entry conditions are logical expressions whose elementary terms are features  . 
All but one of the systems have non . emt ~/ entry conditions . This causes an interdependency among the systems with the result that the grammar of English forms one network of systems  , which cluster when a feature in one system is ( part of ) the entry condition to another system . This dependency gives the network depth : it starts  ( at its " root " ) with very general choices . Other systems of choice depend on them ( i . e . have a feature from one of these systems--orst combination of features from more than one system  . . as entry conditions ) so that the systems of choice become less general  ( more delicate to use the , systemic term ) as we move along in the network . 
The network of systems is where the control of the grammar resides  , its non . deterministic part . Systemic grammar thus contrasts with many other formalisms in that choice is given explicit representation and is captured in a single ruis type  ( systems )  , not distributed over the grammar as e . g . optional rules of different types . This property of systemic grammar makes its very useful component in a text-production system  , seDecially in the interf3ce with semantics and inensuring accessibility of alternatives  . 
The rest of the grammar is deterministic . . the consequences of features chosen in the network of systems  . These conse ( luences are formalized as feature realization statements whose task is to build the appropriate structure  . 
For example , in independent indicative sentences , English offers a choice between declarative and interroaative sentences  , if interrooativ ~ is chosen , this leeds to a dependent system with a choice between wh-ints rrooative and ves/no -interroaative  . When the latter is chosen , it is realized by having ~ . he FINITE verb before the SUBJECT . 
Since it is the general design of the grammar that is the focus of attention  , I will not go through the algorithm for generating a sentence as it has been implemented in NIGEL  . The general observation is that the results are very encouraging  , although it is incomplete . The algorithm generates a wide range of English structures correctly  . There have not been any serious problems in implementing a grammar written in the systemic notation  . 
Before turning to the lexico , part of lexicogrammar , I will give an example of the toplevel structure of a sentence generated by the grammar  .   ( I have left out the details of the internal structure of the constituents  . ) i i i i i ; o . iiIii ! ot I i i i i i i i \]\] i i i l i i ii i I .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   . I .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   . 
In the park Join/s old Arthur 14ce-?reem are needed to get the result desired . .  . The structure is not only functional ( with-functions/m/ools laloeling the consttuents instead of category names like Noun Phrase and Verb Phrase  ) but it is multifunctional . 
Each layer of function symbols shows a particular perspective on the clause structure  . Layer \[1\] gives the aspect of the sentence as a representation of our experience  . The second layer structures the sentence as interaction between the speaker and the hearer  ;  , the fact that SUBJECT precedes FINITE signals that  . the speaker is giving the hearer information . Layer \[3\] represents a structuring of the clause as a message  ; the THEME is its starting point . The functions are called experiential , inte ~ emonal and textual resm~-~Jvety in the systemic framework : the function symbols are said to belong to three different metafunctions  , in the rest of the ! ~ koarI will concentrate on the experiential metafunction  , I = art iy because it will turn out to be highly relevan to the lexicon  . 
The syntactics ut 3 entry.
In the systemic tradition , the syntactic part of the lexicon is seen as a continuation of grammar  ( hence the term lexicogrammar for both of them ) : lsxical choices are simply more detailed ( delicate ) than grammatical choices ( cf .  \[9\]) . The vocabulary of English can be seen as one huge taxonomy  , with Roget's Thesaurus as a very rough model . 
A taxonomic organization of the relevant Dart of the vocabulary of English is intended for PENMAN  , but this Organization is part of the conceptual organization mentioned  al0ove   . There isst present no separate lexica it axonomy . 
The syntactic subentry potentially con~sts of two parts  . There is alv ~ ye the class specification . . the lexical features . This is a statement of the grammatical potential of the lexicai item  , i . e . of how it can be used grammatically . For sold the ' ct as , ~specification is the following : verb
C'/I1~0 c ~ als02 bemlf&ct ,   1re where " benefactive " says that sold can occur in a sentence with a BENEFICIARY  , " class10" that it encodes a material pr ~ ( contrasting with mental , varbai and relational processes ) and " CM as 02" that it is at nmaltive verb . 
In ~ ldition , there is a provision for a configuration aipart , which is a h'agment of a Structure the grammar can generate  , more specifically the experiential part of the grammar  , s The structure corresponds to the top layer (  # \[1\] ) in the example above . In reference to this example , I can make more explicit wh ~ I mean by fragment . The general point is that ( to take just one cimmas an example ) the presence and cflara ~ er of functions like ACTOR  , BENEFICIARY and GOAL . -diractt : ~' ticiplmts in the event denoted by the verb  . -depend on the type of verb , whereas the more circumstantial functions like LOCATION remain unaffected and a ~ oDlical = ie to all ~ of verb  . Conse(luently , the information about the poasibilib/of having a LOCATION constituent is not the type of information that has to be stated for specific lsxical items  . The information given for them concerns only a fragment of the experiential functional structure  . 
The full syntactic entry for sol ~ is:
PROCESS ? veto class IO class 02 befl of lctlve
ACTOR ?
GOAL8EX(FICZAR ?"
This says that sold Can occur in a fragment of a struCt Ure where it is PROCESS and there can be an ACTOR  , a GOAL and a RENEF1 CIARY . 
The usefulness of the structure fragment will be demonstrated in section  4  . 
3. THE PROBLEM
I will now turn to the fundamental proiolem of making a workings/stem out of the parts that have been discu~md  . 
The problem ~ two parts to it . viz.
1 . the design of the system as a system within t . egrated Darts and 2 . the implementation of the system . 
I will only be concerned with the 6 rat aspect here . 
The components of the system have been presented . What remains - . 
and that is the problem--is to dealgn the misalng\[inks  ; tO find the strategies that will do the job of connecting the components  . 
Finding these strategies is a design problem in the following sense  . The stn Uegies do not come as accessories with the frameworks we have u as d  ( the systemic framework and the KL-ONE inspired knowledge reprasent at Jon  )  . Moreover , th ~ me two frameworks stem from two quite dispm ' ate traditions with different sets of goals  , symbols and terms . 
I will state the problem for the grammar first and then for the lexicon  . As it has been presented , the grammar runs wik : l and free . It is organized Mound choice , to be sure , but there is nothing to relate the choices to the rest of the W stem  , in particular to what we can take to be semantics . 
In other word ~ k although the grammar may have ? ~ that faces ~ emantics  . . the system network , which ; in Hallldly'e worcls , is ~ arnantically relevant grammar . -it does not mmke direct contact with semantics . And , if we know what we want the system to ante > de in a sentence  , how can we indicate what goes where , that is what a constituent ( e . 9 . the ACTOR ) should encocle ? The lexicon incorporates the problem of finding an ? opriate strategy to link the components to each other  , since it cuts acros a component bound n , des . The semantic and s/ntsctic subpaJts of a lexica entry have been outlined  , but nothing hall been sak : labout how they should be matched up with one  ,  . , nother . The reason why this match is not ~ rfectly straightforward has to do with the fact that both entries may be sa'uctunm  ( conf , ~ urations ) rather than s~ngle elements . In sedition , there are lexical relations that have not been accounted for yet  , es~lcially synonymy and polysemy . 
5Th ~ conllgurs b ( mld~dQ ~ not mira from the sylmm~tn~libon , i ~ t is In . ~ mmme17 montckm ~4 . 1 . The Grammar
Choice experts and their domains.
The control of the grammar resides in then . et work of systems . Choice experts can be developed to handle the choices in these systems  . 
The idea is that there is an expert for each system in the network and that this expert knows what it takes to make a meaningful choice  , what the factors influencing its choice are . it has at its disposal atable which tells it how to find the relevant pieces of information  , which are somewhere in the knowledge domain , the text plan or the reader model . 
In other words , the part of the grammar that is related to Semantics is the part where the notion of choice is : the choice experts know about the Semantic consequences of the various choices in the grammar and do the job of relating synt cxtO semantics  , s The recognition of different functional component a of the grammar relates to the multi -fun Ctional character of a structure in systemic grimmer I mentioned in rels U onto the example In the park Joans old Arthurice  . cream in section 2 . 2 . The organization of the sentence into PROCESS , ACTOR , BENEFICIARY , GOAL , and LOCATIVE is an organization the grammar impeses on our experience  , and it is the aspect of the organization of the Sentence that relates to the conceptual organization of the knowledge domain : it is in terms of this organization  ( and note . g . SUBJECT , OBJECT , THEME and NEWINFORMATION ) that the mapping between syntax and semlmtic , ,i can be stated . . . The functional diver~ty Hailiday has provided for systemic grammar is useful in a text  . production . slrstam ; the other funct Jone find uses which space does note permit a discuesion of here  . 
Pointers from cJ on slituents.
In order for the choice experts to be able to work  , they must know where to look . Resume that we are working on in the park in our example Sentence in the park Joans old Arthur ice  . cream and that an expert has to decide whether park should be definite or not  . The information about the status in the mind of the reader of the concept corre ~ oonding to park in this sentence is located at this conce~t : the ~ ck is to ~ mociats the concept with the constituent being built  . In the example structure given earlier , in the park is both LOCATION and THEME , only the former of which is relevant othe present problem  . The solution is to set a pointer to the relevant extensional concept when the function symbol LOCATION is inserted  , so that LOCATION will carry the pointer and thus make the information attached to the concept  8ccaesible  . 
4.2. The lexicon and the lexlcal entry
I have already in b-oducad the semantic subentry and the syntactic ? ubentry  . They are stated in a KL-ONE like representation and a systemic notation respec ~ vely  . The queslion now is how to relate the two . 
In the knowledge representation the internal struc ~ Jre of a concept is a configuration of roles and these roles lead to new concepts to which the concept is related  . A syntactic structure is seen as a configuration of a A~d~lnit k ~ not the h ~ isoTintl caoltt ~ gnlmm?rikIs?n liA#otIOl ~' mlC  ,   h0 " minimti ~? whatti ~ Brlmm ? ~ cll ~ ~ io ~ at * . in the Ixment'4/mcus Won , I ~ focun ~ lonIne know ~ dge domain one , ~ ~ this blme mosl r ~ J ~ Imto MmiP . ~' T ~ li ~ . 
/function symbols ; syntactic categories serve these functions -- in the generation of a structure the functions lead to an entry of a part of the network  . For example , the function ACTOR leads to a part of the network who Se entry feature is Nominal Group just~s the role AGENT  ( of SELL ) leads to the concept that is the filler of it . The parallel between the two representations in this area are the following : KRONLEDG\[ REPRESENTATIOMSYNTACTICREPRES\[MTATION rolefu flcttonf  111el " exponent ( Where exponent denotes the entry feature into a pm't of the network  ( e . g . Nominal Group ) that the function leads to . ) This parallel clears the path for a strmegy for relating the Semantic entry and the syntactic entry  . The strategy is in keeping with current ideas in linguistics  . " r Consider the following crude entry for sold , given here a . san illustration :
Subent l , les:
Ii ? ~ ent ~? syntacticol , thogl , lpht ?
FuncttoniL extcelre & furls
SELL-?PROCESS ? vel , b " sold " concept Class 10 class 0Z blfleflttJve
AGENT " ACTOR
OBJECT ? GOAL
RECIPIENT ? BE MEFICIAR ? where the previously discussed semantic and syntactic subentries are repeated and paired off against each other  . 
This full lexical entry makes clear the usefulness of the second part of the syntactic entry  . . the fragment of the experiential functional structure in which sold can be the PROCESS  . 
Another piece of the total pictures is of alls into place now  . The notion of a pointer from an experiential function like BENEFICIARY in the grammatical structure to a point in the conceptual net was introduced above  . We can now see how this pointer may be Set for individua lexical items : it is introduced as a simple relation between a grammatical function symbol and sconceptual role in the iexical entry of e  . g . SELL . 
Since there is an Indlviduates link between this intension ai concept and any extensional SELL the extensional concept that is part of the particular proposition that is being encoded grarnmatica Jly  , the pointer is inherited and will point to a role in the extensional part of the knowledge domain  . 
At this point , I will refer again to the figure below , whose dghthalf I have already referred to as a full example of a semantic subentry  ( " see " )  . 
" sp : " is the spelling or orthographic subentry ; "gee " is the syntactics , ,bentry . 
We have two configurations in the lexicalent ~' y : in the Semantic subentry the concept plus a number of roles and in the syntactic subentry a number of grammatics if unctions  . The match is represented in the . f_i ~ ure above by the arrows .

FIgure 41: Lexical entry for sold in the first step I introduced the KL-ONE like knowledge representation All three roles of SELL have the modaJity " r ~ c ~___  , ~_~' .

They sold many books to their customers and The books old well  , In the second example , the grammar only Dicks out a subset of the roles of SELL for expras~on  .

III can now return to the ol : ~ ervation that the functional diversity Hallidey has provldat for systemic grammar is useful for our pu~__o'-'e ~ -__  ; The fact that grammatical structure is multi . layered means that those aspects of grammatical structure that are relevant to the mapping between the two lexical entries are identified  , made explicit ( as ACTORBENEFICIARY etc . ) and kept seperate from pdnciplas of grernmatical structuring that are not directly relevant to this mapl : dng  ( e . g .

In conclusion , a stretegy for accounting for synonymy and polysemy can be mentioned  . 
The way to cagture synonymy is to allow a concept to be the semantic subentry for two distinct orthographic entries  . If the items are syntactically identical as well . they will also share a syntactic subentry . 
Polyeemy works the other way: . there may be more than one concept for the same syntactic subentry  . 
5. CONCLUSION
I have discus . s ~ lagremmm " and a lexicon for PENMAN in two steps  . 
F ~ rst I looked at the ma ~ independent components -- the semantic entry  , the grammar and the syntactic entry -- and then , after identifying the problems of integrating them into a system  , Itumed to strategies for re!sting the grammar to the conceptual representation and the syntactic entry to the semantic one within the lexicon  . 
and the systemic notation and indicated how their design features can be Outtogood use in PENMAN  . For instance , the distinction between intension and exten * on in the knowledge representation makes it I~OS  . ~ bletole tiexical semantic ~ be part of the conceptuals  . It was also suggested that the relations SuberC . ,at~gory and Indivlduates can be to find expre~- ~ ions for a particular concept  . 
The second steO attempted to connect the grammar to semantics through the notion of the choice expel  , making use of a design principle of systemic grammars where the notion of choice is taken as ba ~ c  . I pointed out the correlation between the structure of a concept and the notion of structure in the systemic framework and allowed how the two can be matched in a lexical entry and in the generation of a sentence  , as lrstegy that could be adopted because of the multl  . funotional nature of structure in systemic grammars  . This second step has been at the same time an attempt to start exploring the potential of a combination of a KL-ONE like representation and a 
Sy~emic Grammar.
Although many ~% oects have had to be left out of the discussion  , there ares number of issues that are of linguistic interest and significance  . 
The most basic one is perhal ~ the task itself : , designing ? model where a grammar and a lexicon can actually be mate to function as more than just structure generators  . One issuerei at at to this that has been brought uD was that different ~ external to the grammar find resonance in different I = ari ~ of the grammar and that there is a partial correlation between tim conceptual structure of the knowleclgere Oresentation and the grammar and lexicon  . 
AS was empha . ~ zacl in the introduction , PENMAN is at the design stage : there is a working sentence generator  , but the other 8 . qDect ~ of what has been di$cut ~ tecl have not been imDlement ~ l and there is no commitment yet to a frozen design  . Naturally , a large number of problems still await their solution  , even at the level of design and , cleerly , many of them will have to wait . For example , selectivity among terms , beyond referential a cle?luacy , is not adclresse cl .

This is clearly an ares for future research . Hopefully , ideas such as grammars organized around choice and cl ~ oice experts will  ; ) rove useful tools in working out extensions .
