Sublanguages_differ from each other , and from the " standard Ian ~ age , in their syntactic , semantic , and discourse vrolx : r ties . Understanding these differences i important ' if - we are to improve our ability to process these sublanguages  . We have developed as en ~ . '- automatic ~ ure for identifying sublangnage syntact/cusage from a sample of text in the sublanguage  . .We describe the results of applying this procedure to taree text samples : two sets of medical documents and a set of equipment failure me~ages  . 
Introduction bAsub~age . is th . ef . oan . of . . natron . " ~ a ~ yaoommumtyots ~ tsmatm ~ mg are smctea domain  . Sublanguages differ from each other , and tron . 
the " standard language , in their syntactic , ~antic , antidiscourse properties . We describe ~ somerec ~ . twork on (- senii -) automatically determining the . syntactic_properties of several sublangnages . This workmpart ot a larger effort aimed at improving the techniques for parsing sublanguages  . 
If wees a minea variety of scientific and technical sublanguages  , we will encounter most of the constructs of the standard language  , plus a number of syntactic extensions . For example , report " sublant gnag ~ , such as are used in medical smmarles and eqmpment failure summaries  , include both full sentences and a number of ~ ag -merit forms \[ Marsh  1983\]  . Specific sublanguages differ in their usage of these syntactic on structs \[ Kittredge  1982  , Lehrberger 1982\] . 
Identifying these differences i important in understanding how sublanguages differ from the Language as a whole  . It also has immediate practical benefits , since it allows us to trimour grammar tOfit the specific sublanguage we are processing  . This can significantly speedup the analysis process and bl ~  . k some spurious parses which would be obtained with a grammar of Overly broadcoverage  . 
Determining Syntaai ? Usage

We are fortunate to have available to us a very broadcoverage English grammar  , the Linguistic . St~ingGrammar\[S~g or 1981\], which hpbeenex ~ . d ~ include the sentence fragn ~ n_ts of certain medical ari acquilnnent failurercix n'm\[ Marsh  1983\]  .

component is stated in terms otlgra . mmatical cam gones such as noun , tensed verb , and ad ~: tive . 
To be . gin . the analysis proce SS , a sample . mrpus is usmg this gr ~, -=-,: . Theme of generan mpar~s_m reviewed manually to eliminate incorrect ~  . xneremalning parses are then fed to a program which  . cc~ts--for each parse tree and . cumulatively for ~ entb'eme . -the number of times that each production mme contextfree component of the grammar was applied in building the tr ? ~  . This yields a " trimmed " context-fr ? ~ grammar for  . the sublangua ! ~ e(consLsting ~ . ~ osc productions use a one or more tunes ) , atong w ~ m z requency information on the various productions  . 
This process was initially applied to text . sampl ~ from two Sublanguages . The . fi~s . t is a se to . xs~pauent documents ( including patient his . tm'y . , eTam , n . ation, . and plan of treatment ) . The second mase to telectrical equipment failure relxals called " CASREPs '  , a class of operational report used by the U . S . Navy\[Froscher 1983\] . The parse file for the patient documents had correct parses for  236 sentences ( and sentence fragments )  ; the file for the CASREPS had correct parses to r 123 sentences . We have recently applied the process , to a third text sample , drawn from a subIanguage vrystmflar to the first : a set of five hospital discharge summaries  , Which include patient histories , e~nmlnnt\[ous , and summaries of the murse of treatment in the hospital  . This last sample included correct parses for 310 sentences . 


The trimmed grarn rtl~l~du ~ from thc three sublanguage txt samples were of comparable size  . The grammar produced from the first set of patient docu-men U  ; col~tained 129 non-termlnal symbols and 248 productions ; the grnmmar from the second set ( the " discharge summaries " ) WasSlightly\]~trger , with 134 non-term in ~ ds and 282 productions . The grammar for the CASREP sublanguage was slightly smaller  , with 124 nonterminal ~ and 220 productions ( this is probably a reflection of the smaller size of the CASR text sample  )  . These figures compare with 255 non-termlnal symbols and 744 productions in the " medical records " grammar used by the New York University Linguistic String Pro ~= t  ( the " medical records " grammar iS the Lingttistic String Project English Grammar with extensions for sen-tencc fragments and other  , sublanguag cspecific , constructs , and with a few options deleted ) . 
Figures 1 and 2 show the cumulative growth in the size of the I ~ " immed grammars for the three sublanguages as a function of the number of sentences in the sample  . 
In Ftgure 1 we plot the number of non-term/halsym bols in the grammar as a function of sample size  ; in Figure 2 , the number of productions in the ~ as a function of sample size  . Note that the curves for the two medical sublanguages  ( curves A and B ) have pretty much fiat-tcned out toward the end , indicating that , by that point , the trimmed grnmm~trCOVe'SaV ~" ylar~fra ~ on of the sentences in the sublanguage  .   ( Some of the jumps in the growth curves for the medical grAmmar Sreflee the ~ vision of the patient documents into sections  ( history , pl3y-sical exam , labtests , etc . ) with different syntactic characteristics . For the first few documents , wl3en a new see-tion bedim , constructs are encountered which did not appear m prior sections  , thus producing a jump in the c11 rve . ) The sublanguage gramma ~ arc substantially smaller than the full English grammar  , reflecting the more lim-it cd range of modifiers and complements in these sublanguages  . While the full grammar has 67 options for sentence object , the sublanguage rammars have substantially restricted mages : each of the three sublanguage grammars has only  14 object options . Further , the grammars greatly overlap , so that the three grammars combined contain only 20 different object options . While sentential complements of nouns are available in the full grammar  , there arc noi~t anc ~ of such a : ~\ [ lstrl lcfions in either medical sublanguage  , aad only one instance in the CASREP sublanguage . The range of modifiers iS also much restrictedia the sublangu = agerammars as compared to the full grammar  .   15 options for sentential modifiers are available in the full grammar  . These are restricted to 9 in the first medical sample , 11 in the second , and 8 in the equipment failure sublangua ~ e . 
Similarly , the full English gr~mmnr has 21 options torright modifiers of nouns ; the sublanguager ~ mma_~S had fewer , 11 in the first medical sumple , I0m " the second , and 7 in the CASREP sublanguage . Here the sublanguage grammars overlap almost completely : only  12 different right modifiers of noun are represented in the three grammars combined  . 
Among the options occurring in all the sublanguage grammars  , their relative frequency varies ao~o~ding to the domain of the text  . For example , the frequency of prepositional phrases as right modifiers of nouns  ( meas ; urea as instances per sentence or sentence fragment  ) was 0 . 36 and 0 . 46 for the two medical samples , as compared to 0 . 77 for the CASREPs . More striking was the frequency of noun phrases with nouns as modifiers of other nouns :  0  . 20 and 0 . 32 for the two medical ~ mples , versus 0 . 80 for the CASREPs . 
We reparsed some of the sentences from the first set of medical documents with the trimmed grammar and  , as ~ , o . bserved a considerable " speedup . Thet . m gumuc ~ mngrarser uses ap . op-uown pa . ~mg algorithm with . ,  . ba ~ track ~" g . A , ~Ldingly , for short , simple sentences which require little backtr ~ . king there was only a small gain in processing speed  ( about 25% )  . For long , complex sentences , however , which require extensive backtracking , the speedup ( by roughly a factor of 3 ) was approximately proportional to the reduction in the number of productions  . In addition , the ~ fyequcn cy of bad parses decreased slightly ( by < 3% ) with the l~mmedy . mm . r ( because some of the bad parses involved syntactic on structs which did not appear many o ~  , ,~ect parse in the sublanguage sample) . 

As natural . lan . .~ , uage interfaces become more mature , their portability . -the ability to move an interface to a new domain and sublenguage-  . is becoming increasingly important . At 8 minimll m , portability requires us to isolate the domain dependent information in a natural \] a Dgua  . ~ . e system\[C ~ OSZ 1983, Gri~hman 1983\] . A more ambitious goalm to provide a discovery procedure for this information -  . a procedure Wl~eh can determine the domain dependent information from sample texts in the sublanguage  . The tcchnkl UeS described above provide a partial , semiautomatic discovery procedure for the syntactic usages of a sublangua ~  . * By applying . these . t ~ gues to a small sublan ~ sample , we ~ adapt a broadcoverage rammart O the syntax of a particular sublanguage  . Sub ~ . quont text from this sublanguage caa then be i ~xessed more efficiently  . 
We are currently extending this work in two directions  . For sentences with two or more parses which ~ at is fy  . both the syntactic and the sublanguages lectional semanu  . 'c ) on straints , we intena to try using the/re-Cency information ga~ered for productions to select  , a invol " ving the more frequent syntactic constructs  . ** Second , we are using as ~ milAr approach to develop a discovery procedure for sublanguages lectional patterns  . 
We are collecting , from the same sublanguage samples , statistics on the frequency of cooccurrence of particular sublan  . guage ( semantic ) classes in subjeet . vedy . ob ~: ct and host-adjunct relations , and are using this data as input to * Partial , because it cannot identify new extensions to the base gramme  ; semiautomatic , because the parses produced with the broadcoverage rammar ? must be manually reviewed  . 
* Some small experiments of this type have been one with a Japanese ~\ [ Naga  0   1982\] with 1mired success . Becat ~ of the v ~_ differ ~ tnature of the grammar  , however , it is not dear whether this lass any implications for our experiments  .
