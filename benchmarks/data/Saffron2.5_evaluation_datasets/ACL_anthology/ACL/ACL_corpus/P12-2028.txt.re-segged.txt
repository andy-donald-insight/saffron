Abstract
In this paper we study unsupervised word sense disambiguation ( WSD ) based on sense definition . We learn low-dimensional latent semantic vectors of concept definitions to construct a more robust sense similarity measure wmfvec . Experiments on four allwords WSD data sets show significant improvement over the baseline WSD systems and LDA based similarity measures , achieving results comparable to state of the art WSD systems.
1 Introduction
To date , many unsupervised WSD systems rely on a sense similarity module that returns a similarity score given two senses . Many similarity measures use the taxonomy structure of WordNet [ WN ] ( Fellbaum , 1998), which allows only noun-noun and verb-verb pair similarity computation since the other parts of speech ( adjectives and adverbs ) do not have a taxonomic representation structure . For example , the jcn similarity measure ( Jiang and Conrath , 1997) computes the sense pair similarity score based on the information content of three senses : the two senses and their least common subsumer in the noun/verb hierarchy.
The most popular sense similarity measure is the Extended Lesk [ elesk ] measure ( Banerjee and Pedersen , 2003). In elesk , the similarity score is computed based on the length of overlapping words/phrases between two extended dictionary definitions . The definitions are extended by definitions of neighbor senses to discover more overlapping words . However , exact word matching is lossy . Below are two definitions from WN : bank#n#1: a financial institution that accepts deposits and channels the money into lending activities stock#n#1: the capital raised by a corporation through the issue of shares entitling holders to an ownership interest ( equity ) Despite the high semantic relatedness of the two senses , the overlapping words in the two definitions are only a , the , leading to a very low similarity score.
Accordingly we are interested in extracting latent semantics from sense definitions to improve elesk.
However , the challenge lies in that sense definitions are typically too short/sparse for latent variable models to learn accurate semantics , since these models are designed for long documents . For example , topic models such as LDA ( Blei et al , 2003), can only find the dominant topic based on the observed words in a definition ( financial topic in bank#n#1 and stock#n#1) without further discernibility . In this case , many senses will share the same latent semantics profile , as long as they are in the same topic/domain.
To solve the sparsity issue we use missing words as negative evidence of latent semantics , as in ( Guo and Diab , 2012). We define missing words of a sense definition as the whole vocabulary in a corpus minus the observed words in the sense definition . Since observed words in definitions are too few to reveal the semantics of senses , missing words can be used to tell the model what the definition is not about.
Therefore , we want to find a latent semantics profile that is related to observed words in a definition , but also not related to missing words , so that the induced latent semantics is unique for the sense.
Finally we also show how to use WN neighbor sense definitions to construct a nuanced sense similarity wmfvec , based on the inferred latent semantic vectors of senses . We show that wmfvec outperforms elesk and LDA based approaches in four All-words WSD data sets . To our best knowledge , wmfvec is the first sense similarity measure based on latent semantics of sense definitions.

Therefore , missing words can be used to prune the hypotheses that are also highly related to the missing words.
Consider the hypotheses of latent vectors in table 1 for bank#n#1. Assume there are 3 dimensions in our latent model : financial , sport , institution . We use Rvo to denote the sum of relatedness between latent vector v and all observed words ; similarly , Rvm is the sum of relatedness between the vector v and all missing words . Hypothesis v1 is given by topic models , where only the financial dimension is found , and it has the maximum relatedness to observed words in bank#n#1 definition Rv1o = 20. v2 is the ideal latent vector , since it also detects that bank#n#1 is related to institution . It has a slightly smaller Rv2o = 18, but more importantly , its relatedness to missing words , Rv2m = 300, is substantially smaller than Rv1m = 600.
However , we cannot simply choose a hypothesis with the maximum Ro ? Rm value , since v3, which is clearly not related to bank#n#1 but with a minimum Rm = 100, will therefore be ( erroneously ) returned as the answer . The solution is straightforward : give a smaller weight to missing words , e.g ., so that the algorithm tries to select a hypothesis with maximum value of Ro ? 0.01 ? Rm . We choose weighted matrix factorization [ WMF ] ( Srebro and Jaakkola , 2003) to implement this idea.
2.2 Modeling Missing Words by Weighted
Matrix Factorization
We represent the corpus of WN definitions as an M ? N matrix X , where row entries are M unique words existing in WN definitions , and columns represent N WN sense ids . The cell Xij records the TFIDF value of word wi appearing in definition of sense sj .
In WMF , the original matrix X is factorized into two matrices such that X ? P>Q , where P is a K ? M matrix , and Q is a K ? N matrix . In this scenario , the latent semantics of each word wi or sense sj is represented as a K-dimension vector P?,i or Q?,j respectively . Note that the inner product of P?,i and Q?,j is used to approximate the semantic relatedness of word wi and definition of sense sj :
Xij ? P?,i ? Q?,j .
In WMF each cell is associated with a weight , so missing words cells ( Xij=0) can have a much less contribution than observed words . Assume wm is the weight for missing words cells . The latent vectors of words P and senses Q are estimated by minimizing the objective function:1? i ? j
Wij ( P?,i ? Q?,j ? Xij ) 2 + ?|| P ||22 + ?|| Q || where Wi,j = { 1, if Xij 6= 0 wm , if Xij = 0 (1) Equation 1 explicitly requires the latent vector of sense Q?,j to be not related to missing words ( P?,i ? Q?,j should be close to 0 for missing words Xij = 0). Also weight wm for missing words is very small to make sure latent vectors such as v3 in table 1 will not be chosen . In experiments we set wm = 0.01.
After we run WMF on the definitions corpus , the similarity of two senses sj and sk can be computed by the inner product of Q?,j and Q?,k.
2.3 A Nuanced Sense Similarity : wmfvec
We can further use the features in WordNet to construct a better sense similarity measure . The most important feature of WN is senses are connected by relations such as hypernymy , meronymy , similar attributes , etc . We observe that neighbor senses are usually similar , hence they could be a good indicator for the latent semantics of the target sense.
We use WN neighbors in a way similar to elesk.
Note that in elesk each definition is extended by including definitions of its neighbor senses . Also , they do not normalize the length . In our case , we also adopt these two ideas : (1) a sense is represented by the sum of its original latent vector and its neighbors ? latent vectors . Let N(j ) be the set of neighbor senses of sense j . then new latent vector is:
Qnew?,j = Q?,j + ? k?N(j ) k Q?,k (2) Inner product ( instead of cosine similarity ) of the two resulting sense vectors is treated as the sense pair similarity . We refer to our sense similarity measure as wmfvec.
1Due to limited space inference and update rules for P and Q are omitted , but can be found in ( Srebro and Jaakkola , 2003) Task : We choose the finegrained AllWords Sense Disambiguation task , where systems are required to disambiguate all the content words ( noun , adjective , adverb and verb ) in documents . The data sets we use are allwords tasks in SENSEVAL2 [ SE2], SENSEVAL3 [ SE3], SEMEVAL-2007 [ SE07], and Semcor.
We tune the parameters in wmfvec and other baselines based on SE2, and then directly apply the tuned models on other three data sets.
Data : The sense inventory is WN3.0 for the four WSD data sets . WMF and LDA are built on the corpus of sense definitions of two dictionaries : WN and Wiktionary [ Wik].2 We do not link the senses across dictionaries , hence Wik is only used as augmented data for WMF to better learn the semantics of words.
All data is tokenized , POS tagged ( Toutanova et al , 2003) and lemmatized , resulting in 341,557 sense definitions and 3,563,649 words.
WSD Algorithm : To perform WSD we need two components : (1) a sense similarity measure that returns a similarity score given two senses ; (2) a disambiguation algorithm that determines which senses to choose as final answers based on the sense pair similarity scores . We choose the Indegree algorithm used in ( Sinha and Mihalcea , 2007; Guo and Diab , 2010) as our disambiguation algorithm . It is a graphbased algorithm , where nodes are senses , and edge weight equals to the sense pair similarity . The final answer is chosen as the sense with maximum indegree . Using the Indegree algorithm allows us to easily replace the sense similarity with wmfvec . In Indegree , two senses are connected if their words are within a local window . We use the optimal window size of 6 tested in ( Sinha and Mihalcea , 2007; Guo and Diab , 2010).
Baselines : We compare with (1) elesk , the most widely used sense similarity . We use the implementation in ( Pedersen et al , 2004).
We believe WMF is a better approach to model latent semantics than LDA , hence the second baseline (2) LDA using Gibbs sampling ( Griffiths and Steyvers , 2004). However , we cannot directly use estimated topic distribution P ( z|d ) to represent the definition since it only has nonzero values on one or two topics . Instead , we calculate the latent vec-2http://en.wiktionary.org/

Table 2: WSD results per POS ( K = 100) tor of a definition by summing up the P ( z|w ) of all constituent words weighted by Xij , which gives much better WSD results.3 We produce LDA vectors [ ldavec ] in the same setting as wmfvec , which means it is trained on the same corpus , uses WN neighbors , and is tuned on SE2.
At last , we compare wmfvec with a mature WSD system based on sense similarities , (3) ( Sinha and Mihalcea , 2007) [ jcn+elesk ], where they evaluate six sense similarities , select the best of them and combine them into one system . Specifically , in their implementation they use jcn for noun-noun and verb-verb pairs , and elesk for other pairs . ( Sinha and Mihalcea , 2007) used to be the state-of-the-art system on SE2 and SE3.
4 Experiment Results
The disambiguation results ( K = 100) are summarized in Table 2. We also present in Table 3 results using other values of dimensions K for wmfvec and ldavec . There are very few words that are not covered due to failure of lemmatization or POS tag mismatches , thereby Fmeasure is reported.
Based on SE2, wmfvec?s parameters are tuned as ? = 20, wm = 0.01; ldavec?s parameters are tuned as ? = 0.05, ? = 0.05. We run WMF on WN+Wik for 30 iterations , and LDA for 2000 iterations . For 3It should be noted that this renders LDA a very challenging baseline to outperform.

LDA , more robust P ( w|z ) is generated by averaging over the last 10 sampling iterations . We also set a threshold to elesk similarity values , which yields better performance . Same as ( Sinha and Mihalcea , 2007), values of elesk larger than 240 are set to 1, and the rest are mapped to [0,1].
elesk vs wmfvec : wmfvec outperforms elesk consistently in all POS cases ( noun , adjective , adverb and verb ) on four datasets by a large margin (2.9% ? 4.5% in total case ). Observing the results yielded per POS , we find a large improvement comes from nouns . Same trend has been reported in other distributional methods based on word cooccurrence ( Cai et al , 2007; Li et al , 2010; Guo and Diab , 2011).
More interestingly , wmfvec also improves verbs accuracy significantly.
ldavec vs wmfvec : ldavec also performs very well , again proving the superiority of latent semantics over surface words matching . However , wmfvec also outperforms ldavec in every POS case except Semcor adverbs ( at least +1% in total case ). We observe the trend is consistent in Table 3 where different dimensions are used for ldavec and wmfvec . These results show that given the same text data , WMF outperforms LDA on modeling latent semantics of senses by exploiting missing words.
jcn+elesk vs jcn+wmfvec : jcn+elesk is a very mature WSD system that takes advantage of the great performance of jcn on noun-noun and verb-verb pairs . Although wmfvec does much better than elesk , using wmfvec solely is sometimes outperformed by jcn+elesk on nouns and verbs . Therefore to beat jcn+elesk , we replace the elesk in jcn+elesk with wmfvec ( hence jcn+wmfvec ). Similar to ( Sinha and Mihalcea , 2007), we normalize wmfvec similarity such that values greater than 400 are set to 1, and the rest values are mapped to [0,1]. We choose the value 400 based on the WSD performance on tuning set SE2. As expected , the resulting jcn+wmfvec can further improve jcn+elesk for all cases . Moreover , jcn+wmfvec produces similar results to state-of-the-art unsupervised systems on SE02, 61.92% F-mearure in ( Guo and Diab , 2010) using WN1.7.1, and SE03, 57.4% in ( Agirre and Soroa , 2009) using WN1.7. It shows wmfvec is robust that it not only performs very well individually , but also can be easily incorporated with existing evidence as represented using jcn.

For example , the target word mouse in the context : ... in experiments with mice that a gene called p53 could transform normal cells into cancerous ones ... elesk returns the wrong sense computer device , due to the sparsity of overlapping words between definitions of animal mouse and the context words . wmfvec chooses the correct sense animal mouse , by recognizing the biology element of animal mouse and related context words gene , cell , cancerous.
5 Related Work
Sense similarity measures have been the core component in many unsupervised WSD systems and lexical semantics research/applications . To date , elesk is the most popular such measure ( McCarthy et al , 2004; Mihalcea , 2005; Brody et al , 2006).
Sometimes people use jcn to obtain similarity of noun-noun and verb-verb pairs ( Sinha and Mihalcea , 2007; Guo and Diab , 2010). Our similarity measure wmfvec exploits the same information ( sense definitions ) elesk and ldavec use , and outperforms them significantly on four standardized data sets . To our best knowledge , we are the first to construct a sense similarity by latent semantics of sense definitions.
6 Conclusions
We construct a sense similarity wmfvec from the latent semantics of sense definitions . Experiment results show wmfvec significantly outperforms previous definition-based similarity measures and LDA vectors on four allwords WSD data sets.
