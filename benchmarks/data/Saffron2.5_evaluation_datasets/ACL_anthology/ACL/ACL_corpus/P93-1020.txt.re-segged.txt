Abstract
Certain spans of utterances in a discourse , referred to here as segments , are widely assumed to form coherent units . Further , the segmental structure of discourse has been claimed to constrain and be constrained by many phenomena  . However , there is weak consensus on the nature of segments and the criteria for recognizing or generating them  . We present quantitativer sults of a two part study using a corpus of spontaneous  , narrative monologues . 
The first part evaluates the statistical reliability of human segmentation four corpus  , where speaker intention is the segmentation criterion  . We then use the subjects ' segmentations to evaluate the correlation of discourse segmentation with three linguistic cues  ( referential noun phrases , cue words , and pauses ) , using information retrieval metrics . 

A discourse consists not simply of a linear sequence of utterances  ,   1 hut of meaningful relations among the utterances . As in much of the literature on discourse processing  , we assume that certain spans of utterances , referred to here as discourse segments , form coherent units . The segmental structure of discourse has been claimed to constrain and be constrained by disparate phenomena : cue phrases  ( Hirschberg and Litman , 1993; Gross and Sidner , 1986; Reichman , 1985; Cohen , 1984); lexical cohesion ( Morris and Hirst , 1991); plans and intentions ( Carberry , 1990; Litman and Allen , 1990; Gross and Sidner , 1986); prosody ( Grosz and Hirschberg , 1992; Hirschberg and Gross , 1992; Hirschberg and Pierrehumbert , 1986); reference ( Webber , 1991; Gross and Sidner , 1986; Linde , 1979); and tense ( Webber , 1988; Hwang and Schubert , 1992; Song and Cohen ,  1991) . However , there is weak consensus on the nature of segments and the criteria for recognizing or generating them in a natural anguage processing system  . 
Until recently , little empirical work has been directed at establishing obje ' ~ ivelyverifiable segment boundaries  , even though this is a precondition for 1We use the term utterance to mean a use of a sentence or other linguistic unit  , whether in text or spoken language .

Figure 1: Discourse Segment Structure avoiding circularity in relating segments to linguistic phenomena  . We present he results of a two part study on the reliability of human segmentation  , and correlation with linguisticues . We show that human subjects can reliably perform discourse segmentation using speaker intention as a criterion  . 
We use the segmentations produced by our subjects to quantify and evaluate the correlation of discourse segmentation with three linguistic cues : referential noun phrases  , cue words , and pauses . 
Figure 1 illustrates how discourse structure interacts with reference resolution in an excerp taken from our corpus  . The utterances of this discourse are grouped into two hierarchically structured segments  , with segment 2 embedded in segment 1 . This segmental structure is crucial for determining that the boxed pronoun he corefers with the boxed noun phrase a farmer  . Without he segmentation , the referent of the underlined noun phrase a man with a goat is a potential referent of the pronoun because it is the most recent noun phrase consistent with the number and gender estrictions of the pronoun  . 
With the segmentation aalys is , a man with a goat is ruled out on structural grounds  ; this noun phrase occurs in segment 2 , while the pronoun occurs after resumption of segment  1  . A farmer is thus the most recent noun phrase that is both consistent with  , and noun in question . 
One problem in trying to model such discourse structure effects is that segmentation has been observed to be rather subjective  ( Mann et al , 1992; Johnson ,  1985) . Several researchers have begun to investigate the ability of humans to agree with one another on segmentation  . Grosz and Hirschberg ( Grosz and Hirschberg , 1992; Hirschberg and Grosz ,  1992 ) asked subjects to structure three AP news stories  ( averaging 450 words in length ) according to the model of Grosz and Sidner ( 1986 )  . 
Subjects identified hierarchical structures of discourse segments  , as well as local structural features , using text alone as well as text and professionally recorded speech  . Agreement ranged from 74%-95% , depending upon discourse feature . Hearst ( 1993 ) asked subjects to place boundaries between paragraphs of three expository texts  ( length 77 to 160 sentences )  , to indicate topic changes . She found agreement greater than 80% . We present results of an empirical study of a large corpus of spontaneous or al narratives  , with a large number of potential boundaries per narrative  . Subjects were asked to segment transcripts using an informal notion of speaker intention  . As we will see , we found agreement ranging from 82%-92% , with very high levels of statistical significance  ( from p = . 114 x10-6 top < . 6 x109) . 
One of the goals of such empirical work is to use the results to correlate linguisticues with discourse structure  . By asking subjects to segment discourse using a nonlinguistic criterion  , the correlation of linguistic devices with independently derived segments can be investigated  . Grosz and Hirschberg ( Grosz and Hirschberg , 1992; Hirschberg and Grosz ,  1992 ) derived a discourse structure for each text in their study  , by incorporating the structural features agreed upon by all of their subjects  . 
They then used statistical measures to characterize these discourse structures in terms of acoustic-prosodic features  . Morris and Hirst ( 1991 ) structured a set of magazine texts using the theory of Grosz and Sidner  ( 1986 )  . They developed a lexical cohesion algorithm that used the information in a thesaurus to segment text  , then qualitatively compared their segmentations with the re-suits  . Hearst ( 1993 ) derived a discourse structure for each text inher study  , by incorporating the boundaries agreed upon by the majority of her subjects  . 
Hearst developed a lexical algorithm based on information retrieval measurements to segment text  , then qualitatively compared the results with the structures derived from her subjects  , as well as with those produced by Morris and Hirst  . Iwanska ( 1993 ) compares her segmentations of factual reports with segmentations produced using syntactic  , semantic , and pragmatic information . We derive segmentations from our empirical data based on the statisti-cM significance of the agreement among subjects  , or boundary strength . We develop three segmentation algorithms , based on results in the discourse literature . We use measures from information retrieval to quantify and evaluate the correlation between the segmentations produced by our algorithms and those derived from our subjects  . 
RELIABILITY
The correspondence between discourse segments and more abstract units of meaning is poorly understood  ( see ( Moore and Pollack ,  1992)) . A number of alternative proposals have been presented which directly or indirectly relate segments to intentions  ( Grosz and Sidner ,  1986) , RST relations ( Mann et al , 1992) or other semantic relations ( Polanyi ,  1988) . We present initial results of an investigation of whether naive subjects can reliably segment discourse using speaker intention as a criterion  . 
Our corpus consists of 20 narrative monologues about the same movie , taken from Chafe (1980) ( N~14 , 000 words ) . The subjects were introductory psychology students at the University of Connecticut and volunteers solicited from electronic bullet in boards  . Each narrative was segmented by 7 subjects . Subjects were instructed to identify each point in a narrative where the speaker had completed one communicative task  , and began a new one . They were also instructed to briefly identify the speaker's intention associated with each segment  . Intention was explained in common sense terms and by example  ( details in ( Litman and Passonneau ,  1993)) . 
To simplify data collection , we did no task subjects to identify the type of hierarchical relations among segments illustrated in Figure  1  . In a pilot study we conducted , subjects found it difficult and time-consuming to identify non-sequential relations  . 
Given that the average length of our narratives i 700 words , this is consistent with previous findings ( Rotondo ,  1984 ) that nonlinear segmentation is impractical for naive subjects in discourses longer than  200 words . " Since prosodic phrases were already marked in the transcripts  , we restricted subjects to placing boundaries between prosodic phrases  . In principle , this makes it more likely that subjects will agree on a given boundary than if subjects were completely unrestricted  . However , previou studies have shown that the smallest unit subjects use in similar tasks corresponds roughly to a breath group  , prosodic phrase , or clause ( Chafe , 1980; Rotondo , 1984; Hirschberg and Grosz ,  1992) . Using smaller units would have artificially lowered the probability for agreement on boundaries  . 
Figure 2 shows the responses of subjects at each potential boundary site for a portion of the excerpt from Figure  1  . Prosodic phrases are numbered sequentially , with the first field indicating prosodic phrases with sentence-final contours  , and the second l6 SUBJECTSINP , PAUSE 4 . 1\[I . 0 \[ . 5\] U-hi a number of people are going by ,

Note that a majority of subjects agreed on only 2 of the 11 possible boundary sites : after 3  . 3 ( n = 6) and after 8 . 4 ( n = 7) . ( The symbols NP , CUE and PAUSE will be explained later . ) Figure 2 typifies our results . Agreement among subjects was far from perfect , as shown by the presence here of 4 boundary sites identified by only 1 or 2 subjects . Nevertheless , as we show in the following sections , the degree of agreement among subjects is high enough to demonstrate hat segments can be reliably identified  . In the next section we discuss the percent agreement among subjects  . In the subsequent section we show that the frequency of boundary sites where a majority of subjects assign a boundary is highly significant  . 
AGREEMENTAMONG SUBJECTS
We measure the ability of subjects to agree with one another  , using a figure called percent agreement . 
Percent agreement , defined in ( Gale et al ,  1992) , is the ratio of observed agreements with the majority opinion to possible agreements with the majority opinion  . Here , agreement among four , five , six , or seven subjects on whether or not there is a segment boundary between two adjacent prosodic phrases constitutes a majority opinion  . Given a transcript of length n prosodic phrases , there are n1 possible boundaries . The total possible agreements with the majority corresponds to the number of subjects times  n1  . Teral observed agreements equals the number of times that subjects ' boundary decisions agree with the majority opinion  . As 2The transcripts presented to subjects did not contain line numbering or pause information  ( pauses indicated here by bracketed numbers . ) noted above , only 2 of the 11 possible boundaries in Figure 2 are boundaries using the majority opinion criterion  . There are 77 possible agreements with the majority opinion , and 71 observed agreements . 
Thus , percent agreement for the excerpt as a whole is 71/77  , or 92% . The breakdown of agreement on boundary and non -boundary majority opinions is  13/14   ( 93% ) and 58/63 ( 92% )  , respectively . 
The figures for percent agreement with the majority opinion for all  20 narratives are shown in Table 1  . The columns represent the narratives in our corpus  . The first two rows give the absolute number of potential boundary sites in each narrative  ( i . e . , n1 ) followed by the corresponding percent agreement figure for the narrative as a whole  . Percent agreement in this case averages 89% ( variance ~ r = . 0006; max . = 92%; min . =82%) . The next two pairs of rows give the figures when the majority opinions are broken down into boundary and non-boundary opinions  , respectively . Non-boundaries , with an average percent agreement of 91% ( tr = . 0006; max . = 95%; min . =84%) , show greater agreement among subjects than boundaries  , where average percent agreement is 73% ( or = . 003; max . = 80%; min . =60%) . This partly reflects the fact that non-boundaries greatly outnumber boundaries  , an average of 89 versus 11 majority opinions per transcript . The low variances , or spread around the average , show that subjects are also consistent with one another  . 
Defining a task so as to maximize percent agreement can be difficult  . The high and consistent levels of agreement for our task suggest hat we have found a useful experimental formulation of the task of discourse segmentation  . Furthermore , our percent agreement figures are comparable with the results of other segmentation studies discussed above  . 
While studies of other tasks have achieved stronger results  ( e . g . , 96 . 8% in a word sense disambiguation study ( Gale et al ,  1992)) , the meaning of percent agreement in isolation is unclear  . For example , a percent agreement figure of less than 90% could still be very meaningful if the probability of obtaining such a figure is low  . In the next section we demonstrate the significance of our findings  . 
STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE
We represent the segmentation data for each narrative as an xj matrix of height  i=7 subjects and width j=n-1  . The value in each cell ci , j is a one if the ith subject assigned a boundary atsite j  , and a zero if they did not . We use Cochran's test ( Cochran ,  1950 ) to evaluate significance of differences across columns in the matrix  .   3 Cochran's test assumes that the number of Is within a single row of the matrix is fixed by observation  , and that the totals across rows can vary . 
Here a row total corresponds to the total number 3We thank Julia Hirschberg for suggesting this test .

In the case of narrative 9(j = 96) , one of the subjects assigned 8 boundaries . The probability of a 1 in any of the j cells of the row is thus 8/96  , with ( 9s6 ) ways for the 8 boundaries to be distributed . Taking this into account for each row , Cochran's test evaluates the null hypothesis that the number of ls in a column  , here the total number of subjects assigning a boundary at the jth site  , is randomly distributed . Where the row totals are ui , the column totals are Tj , and the average column total is T , the statistic is given by : Q approximates the X 2 distribution with j1 degrees of freedom ( Cochran ,  1950) . Our results indicate that the agreement among subjects is extremely highly significant  . That is , the number of 0s or ls in certain columns is much greater than would be expected by chance  . For the 20 narratives , the probabilities of the observed distributions range from p =  . ll 4x10-6 top <, 6x10-9 . 
The percent agreement analysis classified all the potential boundary sites into two classes  , boundaries versus non-boundaries , depending on how the majority of subjects responded  . This is justified by further analysis of Q . As noted in the preceding section , the proportion of non-boundaries agreed upon by most subjects  ( i . e . , where 0 < Tj < 3 ) is higher than the proportion of boundaries they agree on  ( 4 < Tj < 7 )  . That agreement on non-boundaries is more probable suggests that the significance of Qowesmost to the cases where columns have a majority of l's  . This assumption is borne out when Q is partitioned into distinct components for each possible value of Tj  ( 0 to 7 )  , based on partioning the sum of squares in the numerator of Q into distinct samples  ( Cochran ,  1950) . We find that Qj is significant for each distinct Tj >  4 across all narratives . 
For Tj = 4, . 0002 < p < . 30 x 10-s ; probabilities become more signfficant for higher levels of Tj  , and the converse . At Tj = 3 , p is sometimes above our significance level of . 01, depending on the narrative . 
DISCUSSION OFRESULTS
We have shown that anatheoretical notion of speaker intention is understood sufficiently uniformly by naive subjects to yield significant agreement across subjects on segment boundaries in a corpus of oral narratives  . We obtained high levels of percent agreement on boundaries as well as on non-boundaries  . Because the average narrative length is 100 prosodic phrases and boundaries are relatively infrequent  ( average boundary frequency = 16% )  , percent agreement among ? subjects ( row one in Table 1 ) is largely determined by percent agreement on non -boundaries  ( row three )  . Thus , total percent agreement could be very high , even if subjects did not agree on any boundaries . However , our results show that percent agreement on boundaries is not only high  ( row two )  , but also statistically significant . 
We have shown that boundaries agreed on by at least  4 subjects are very unlikely to be the result of chance  . Rather , they most likely reflect the validity of the notion of segment as defined here  . In Figure 2 ,   6 of the 11 possible boundary sites were identified by at least  1 subject . Of these , only two were identified by a majority of subjects  . If we take these two boundaries , appearing after prosodic phrases 3 . 3 and 8 . 4 , to be statistically validated , we arrive at a linear version of the segmentation used in Figure  1  . 
In the next section we evaluate how well statistically validated boundaries correlate with the distribution of linguistic cues  . 
CORRELATION
In this section we present and evaluate three discourse segmentation algorithms  , each based on the use of a single linguistic cue : referential noun phrases  ( NPs )  , cue words , and pauses .   4 While the discourse effects of these and other linguistic phenomena have been discussed in the literature  , there has been little work on examining the use of such effects for recognizing or generating segment boundaries  , or on evaluating the comparative utility of different phenomena for these tasks  . The algorithms reported here were developed based on ideas in the literature  , then evaluated on a representative set of 10 narratives . Our results allow us to directly compare the performance of the three algorithms  , to understand the utility of the individual knowledge sources  . 
We have not yet attempted to create comprehensive algorithms that would incorporate all possible relevant features  . In subsequent phases of our work , we will tune the algorithms by adding and 4The input to each algorithm is a discourse transcription labeled with prosodic phrases  . In addition , for the NP algorithm , noun phrases need to be labeled with anaphoric relations  . The pause algorithm requires pauses to be noted . 
SA notable exception is the literature on pauses.

Table 2: Evaluation Metrics refining features , using the initial 10 narratives as a training set . Final evaluation will be on a test set corresponding to the  10 remaining narratives . 
The initial results reported here will provide us with a baseline for quantifying improvements resulting from distinct modifications to the algorithms  . 
We use metrics from the area of information retrieval to evaluate the performance of our algorithms  . The correlation between the boundaries produced by an algorithm and those independently derived from our subjects can be represented as a matrix  , as shown in Table 2 . The value a ( in cell cz , 1) represents the number . of potential boundaries identified by both the algorithm and the subjects  , b the number identified by the algorithm but not the subjects  , c the number identified by the subjects but not the algorithm  , and d the number neither the algorithm nor the subjects identified  . Table 2 also shows the definition of the four evaluation metrics in terms of these values  . Recall errors represent the false rejection of a boundary  , while precision errors represent he false acceptance of a boundary  . An algorithm with perfect performance segments a discourse by placing a boundary at all and only those locations with a subject boundary  . Such an algorithm has 100% recall and precision , and 0% fallout and error . 
For each narrative , our human segmentation data provides us with a set of boundaries classified by  7 levels of subject strength : ( 1 < T/<7 )  . 
That is , boundaries of strength 7 are the set of possible boundaries identified by all  7 subjects . As a baseline for examining the performance of our algorithms  , we compare the boundaries produced by the algorithms to boundaries of strength ~>_  4  . These are the statistically validated boundaries discussed above  , i . e . , those boundari . ~,, ~ identified by 4 or more subjects . Note that recall for ~> 4 corresponds to percent agreement for boundaries . We also examine the evaluation metrics for each algorithm  , cross-classified by the individua levels of boundary strength  . 
REFERENTIALNOUNPHRASES
Our procedure for encoding the input to the referring expression algorithm takes  4 factors into account , as documented in ( Passonneau , 1993a ) . 
Briefly , we construct a 4-tuple for each referential NP : < FIC , NP , i , I > . FIC is clause location , NP is surface form , i is referential identity , and I is a set of inferential relations . Clause location is de-25 16 . 1 You could hear the bicycler 2,16 . 2 wheels ls going round . 
CODING < 25, wheels , 13, (13 rl 12) >
Figure 3: Sample Coding ( from Narrative 4 ) termined by sequentially assigning distinct indices to each functionally independent clause  ( FIC )  ; an FIC is roughly equivalent to a tensed clause that is neither a verb argument nor a restrictive relative  . 
Figure 3 illustrates the coding of an NP , wheels.
It's location is FIC number 25 . The surface form is the string wheels . The wheels are new to the discourse , so the referential index 13 is new . The inferential relation ( 13 rl 12 ) indicates that the wheels entity is related to the bicycle entity  ( index 12 ) by a part/whole relation .   6 The input to the segmentation algorithm is a list of  4-tuples representing all the referential NPs in a narrative  . The output is a set of boundaries B , represented as ordered pairs of adjacent clauses :   ( FIC ,   , FIC , + I ) . Before describing how boundaries are assigned , we explain that the potential boundary locations for the algorithm  , between each FIC , differ from the potential boundary locations for the human study  , between each prosodic phrase . Cases where multiple prosodic phrases map to one FIC  , as in Figure 3 , simply reflect the use of additional linguistic features to reject certain boundary sites  , e . g . , (16 . 1,16 . 2) . However , the algorithm has the potential to assign multiple boundaries between adjacent prosodic phrases  . The example shown in Figure 4 has one boundary site available to the human subjects  , between 3 . 1 and 3 . 2 . Because 3 . 1 consists of multiple FICs ( 6 and 7 ) the algorithm can and does assign 2 boundaries here: ( 6 , 7) and (7 , 8) . To normalize the algorithm output , we reduce multiple boundaries at a boundary site to one  , here (7 , 8) . A total of 5 boundaries are eliminated in 3 of the 10 test narratives ( out of 213 in all 10 )  . All the remaining boundaries ( here (3 . 1,3 . 2)) fall into class b of Table 2 . 
The algorithm operates on the principle that if an NP in the current FIC provides a referential link to the current segment  , the current segment continues . However , NPs and pronouns are treated differently based on the notion of focus  ( cf . ( Passonneau , 1993a ) . A third person definite pronoun provides a referential link if its index occurs anywhere in the current segment  . Any other NP type provides a referential in k if its index occurs in the immediately preceding FIC  . 
The symbol NP in Figure 2 indicates boundaries assigned by the algorithm . Boundary (3 . 3,4 . 1) is assigned because the sole NP in 4 . 1 , a number of people , refers to a new entity , one that cannot be inferred from any entity mentioned in  3  . 3 . Boundary 6We use 5 inferrability relations ( Passonneau , 1993a ) . 
Since there is a phrase boundary between the bicycle and wheels  , we do not take bicycle to modify wheels .

FIC , * is the current clause ( at location n ); CD , is the set of all indices for NPs in FIC , ; F , is the set of entities that are inferrentially linked to entities in CD n  ; PRO , , is the subset of CD , where NP is a third person definite pronoun ;   CDn-1 is the contextual domain for the previous FIC , and CDs is the contextual domain for the current segment  . FIC , * continues the current segment if it is anaphorically inked to the preceding clause  1  ) by a coreferential NP , or 2) by an inferential relation , or 3) if a third person definite pronoun in FIC , * refers to an entity in the current segment . If no boundary is added , CDs is updated with CD n . If all 3 tests fail , FICn is determined to begin a new segment , and ( FICn_I , FICn ) is added to B .

Note that the error rate and fall out , which in a sense are more sensitive measures of in accuracy  , are both much lower than the precision and have very low variance  . Both recall and precision have a relatively high variance  . 
CUEWORDS
Cue words ( e . g . , " now " ) are words that are sometimes used to explicitly signal the structure of a discourse  . We develop ab , ' ~ eline segmentation algorithm based on cue words , using a simplification of one of the features hown by Hirschberg and Litman  ( 1993 ) to identify discourse usages of cue words . 
Hirschberg and Litman ( 1993 ) examine a large set of cue words proposed in the literature and show that certain prosodic and structural features  , including a position of first in prosodic phrase , are highly correlated with the discourse uses of these words  . The input to our lower bound cue word algorithm is a sequential list of the prosodic phrases constituting a given narrative  , the same input our subjects received . The output is a set of boundaries B , represented as ordered pairs of adjacent phrases ( P , ,P , *+ I ) , such that the first item in P , *+ I is a member of the set of cue words summarized in Hirschberg and Litman  ( 1993 )  . That is , if a cue word occurs at the beginning of a prosodic phrase  , the usage is assumed to be discourse and thus the phrase is taken to be the beginning of a new segment  . Figure 2 shows 2 boundaries ( CUE ) assigned by the algorithm , both due to and . 
Table 3 shows the average performance of the cue word algorithm for statistically validated boundaries  . Recall is 72% ( cr = . 027; max = . 88; min = . 40), precision is 15% ( or = . 003; max = . 23; min = . 04), fallout is 53% ( a = . 006) and error is 50% (~= . 005) . 
While recall is quite comparable to human performance  ( row 4 of the table )  , the precision is low while fall out and error are quite high  . Precision , fallout and error have much lower variance , however . 

Grosz and Hirschberg ( Grosz and Hirschberg , 1992; Hirschberg and Grosz ,  1992 ) found that in a corpus of recordings of AP news texts  , phrases beginning discourse segments are correlated with duration of preceding pauses  , while phrases ending discourse segments are correlated with subsequent pauses  . We use a simplification of these results to develop a baseline algorithm for identifying boundaries in our corpus using pauses  . The input to our pause segmentation algorithm is a sequential list of all prosodic phrases constituting a given narrative  , with pauses ( and their durations ) noted . The output is a set of boundaries B , represented as ordered pairs of adjacent phrases ( P , * , Pn+I ) , such that there is a pause between Pn and Pn+l- Unlike Grosz and Hirschberg  , we do not currently take phrase duration into account  . In addition , since our segmentation task is not hierarchical , we do not note whether phrases begin , end , suspend , or resume segments .

Table 3 shows the average performance of the pause algorithm for statistically validated boundaries  . Recall is 92% (~= . 008; max = l;min = . 73), precision is 18% (~= . 002; max = . 25; min = . 09), fall out is 54% ( a = . 004), and error is 49% ( a = . 004) . 
Our algorithm thus performs with recall higher than human performance  . However , precision is low,

DISCUSSION OFRESULTS
In order to evaluate the performance measures for the algorithms  , it is important ounders t and how individual humans perform on all  4 measures . Row 4 of Table 3 reports the average individual performance for the  70 subjects on the 10 narratives . The average recall for humans is . 74 (~= . 038), ~ and the average precision is . 55 ( a = . 027), much lower than the ideal scores of 1 . The fallout and error rates of . 09 (~= . 004) and . 11 ( a = . 003 ) more closely approximate the ideal scores of 0 . The low recall and precision reflect the considerable variation in the number of boundarie subjects assign  , as well as the imperfect percent agreement ( Table 1 )  . 
To compare algorithms , we must take into account the dimensions along which they differ apart from the different cues  . For example , the referring expression algorithm ( RA ) differs markedly from the pause and cue algorithms  ( PA , CA ) in using more knowledge . CA and PA depend only on the ability to identify boundary sites  , potential cue words and pause locations while RA relies on  4 features of NPs to make 3 differentests ( Figure 5 )  . Unsurprisingly , RA performs most like humans . For both CA and PA , the recall is relatively high , but the precision is very low , and the fallout and error rate are both very high  . For lZA , recall and precision are not as different , precision is higher than CA and PA , and fallout and error rate are both relatively low  . 
A second dimension to consider in comparing 7Human recall is equivalent to percent agreement for boundaries  . However , the average shown here represents only 10 narratives , while the average from Table 1 represents all 20 . 
performance is that humans and RA assign boundaries based on a global criterion  , in contrast oCA and PA . Subjects typically use a relatively gross level of speaker intention  . By default , RA assumes that the current segment continues , and assigns a boundary under relatively narrow criteria  . However , CA and PA rely on cues that are relevant at the local as well as the global level  , and consequently assign boundaries more often . This leads to a preponder-ance of cases where PA and CA propose a boundary but where a majority of humans did not  , category b from Table 2 . High blowers precision , reflected in the low precision for CA and PA . 
We are optimistic that all three algorithms can be improved  , for example , by discriminating among types of pauses , types of cue words , and features of referential NPs . We have enhanced RA with certain grammatical role features following  ( Passonneau , 1993b ) . In a preliminary experiment using boundaries from our first set of subjects  ( 4 per narrative instead of 7 )  , this increased both recall and precision by , ~ 10% . 
The statistical results validate boundaries agreed on by a majority of subjects  , but do not thereby invalidate boundaries proposed by only  13 subjects . We evaluate how performance varies with boundary strength  ( 1 _< 7 )  _< 7 )  . Table 4 shows recall and precision of RA , PA , CA and humans when boundaries are broken down into those identified by exactly  1 subject , exactly 2 , and so on up to 7 .   8 There is a strong tendency for recall to increase and precision to decrease as boundary strength increases  . We take this as evidence that the presence of a boundary is not a binary decision  ; rather , that boundaries vary in perceptual salience . 

We have shown that human subjects can reliably perform linear discourse segmentation ia corpus of transcripts of spoken narratives  , using an informal notion of speaker intention . We found that percent agreement with the segmentations produced by the majority of subjects ranged from  82%-92%  , with an average across all narratives of 89% (~= . 0006) . 
We found that these agreement results were highly significant  , with probabilities of randomly achieving our findings ranging from p =  . 114 x10-6 top < . 6 x10-9 . 
We have investigated the correlation of our intention-based discourse segmentations with referential noun phrases  , cue words , and pauses . We developed segmentation algorithms based on the use of each of these linguistic cues  , and quantitatively evaluated their performance in identifying the statistically validated boundaries independently produced by our subjects  . We found that compared to human performance , the recall of the three algorithms SF all out and error rate do not vary much a cross Ti  . 
154 was comparable , the precision was much lower , and the fallout and error of only the noun phrase algorithm was comparable  . We also found a tendency for recall to increase and precision to decrease with exact boundary strength  , suggesting that the cognitive salience of boundaries i graded  . 
While our initial results are promising , there is certainly room for improvement . In future work on our data , we will attempt to maximize the correlation of our segmentations with linguistic cues by improving the performance of our individual algorithms  , and by investigating ways to combine our algorithms  ( cf . Grosz and Hirschberg (1992)) . We will also explore the use of alternative valuation metrics  ( e . g . string matching ) to support close as well as exact correlation .
