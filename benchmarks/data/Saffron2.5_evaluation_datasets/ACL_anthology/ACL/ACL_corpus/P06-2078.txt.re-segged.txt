Abstract
To solve a problem of how to evaluate
computer-produced summaries , a number
of automatic and manual methods have
been proposed . Manual methods evaluate
summaries correctly , because humans
evaluate them , but are costly . On the
other hand , automatic methods , which
use evaluation tools or programs , are low
cost , although these methods cannot
evaluate summaries as accurately as
manual methods . In this paper , we
investigate an automatic evaluation
method that can reduce the errors of
traditional automatic methods by using
several evaluation results obtained
manually . We conducted some
experiments using the data of the Text
Summarization Challenge 2 ( TSC-2). A
comparison with conventional automatic
methods shows that our method
outperforms other methods usually used.
1 Introduction
Recently , the evaluation of computer-produced summaries has become recognized as one of the problem areas that must be addressed in the field of automatic summarization . To solve this problem , a number of automatic ( Donaway et al , 2000, Hirao et al , 2005, Lin et al , 2003, Lin , 2004, Hori et al , 2003) and manual methods ( Nenkova et al , 2004, Teufel et al , 2004) have been proposed . Manual methods evaluate summaries correctly , because humans evaluate them , but are costly . On the other hand , automatic methods , which use evaluation tools or programs , are low cost , although these methods cannot evaluate summaries as accurately as manual methods . In this paper , we investigate an automatic method that can reduce the errors of traditional automatic methods by using several evaluation results obtained manually . Unlike other automatic methods , our method estimates manual evaluation scores . Therefore , our method makes it possible to compare a new system with other systems that have been evaluated manually.
There are two research studies related to our work ( Kazawa et al , 2003, Yasuda et al , 2003).
Kazawa et al (2003) proposed an automatic evaluation method using multiple evaluation results from a manual method . In the field of machine translation , Yasuda et al (2003) proposed an automatic method that gives an evaluation result of a translation system as a score for the Test of English for International
Communication ( TOEIC ). Although the effectiveness of both methods was confirmed experimentally , further discussion of four points , which we describe in Section 3, is necessary for a more accurate summary evaluation . In this paper , we address three of these points based on Kazawa?s and Yasuda?s methods . We also investigate whether these methods can outperform other automatic methods.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows . Section 2 describes related work.
Section 3 describes our method . To investigate the effectiveness of our method , we conducted some examinations and Section 4 reports on these . We present some conclusions in Section 5.
2 Related Work
Generally , similar summaries are considered to obtain similar evaluation results . If there is a set of summaries ( pooled summaries ) produced from a document ( or multiple documents ) and if these are evaluated manually , then we can estimate a manual evaluation score for any summary to be evaluated with the evaluation results for those pooled summaries . Based on this idea , Kazawa et multiple evaluation results from a manual method . First , n summaries for each document , m , were prepared . A summarization system generated summaries from m documents . Here , we represent the ith summary for the jth document and its evaluation score as xij and yij , respectively.
The system was evaluated using Equation 1.
?? = = += m i ijij n j j bxxSimywxscr 1 1 ),()( (1)
The evaluation score of summary x was obtained by summing parameter b for all the subscores calculated for each pooled summary , xij . A subscore was obtained by multiplying a parameter wj , by the evaluation score yij , and the similarity between x and xij.
In the field of machine translation , there is another related study . Yasuda et al (2003) proposed an automatic method that gives an evaluation result of a translation system as a score for TOEIC . They prepared 29 human subjects , whose TOEIC scores were from 300s to 800s , and asked them to translate 23 Japanese conversations into English . They also generated translations using a system for each conversation.
Then , they evaluated both translations using an automatic method , and obtained WH , which indicated the ratio of system translations that were superior to human translations . Yasuda et al calculated WH for each subject and plotted the values along with their corresponding TOEIC scores to produce a regression line . Finally , they defined a point where the regression line crossed WH = 0.5 to provide the TOEIC score for the system.
Though , the effectiveness of Kazawa?s and
Yasuda?s methods were confirmed experimentally , further discussions of four points , which we describe in the next section , are necessary for a more accurate summary evaluation.
3 Investigation of an Automatic Method using Multiple Manual Evaluation
Results 3.1 Overview of Our Evaluation Method and Essential Points to be Discussed We investigate an automatic method using multiple evaluation results by a manual method based on Kazawa?s and Yasuda?s method . The procedure of our evaluation method is shown as follows ; ( Step 1) Prepare summaries and their evaluation results by a manual method ( Step 2) Calculate the similarities between a summary to be evaluated and the pooled summaries ( Step 3) Combine manual scores of pooled summaries in proportion to their similarities to the summary to be evaluated For each step , we need to discuss the following points.
(Step 1) 1. How many summaries , and what type ( variety ) of summaries should be prepared?
Kazawa et al prepared 6 summaries for each document , and Yasuda et al prepared 29 translations for each conversation.
However , they did not examine about the number and the type of pooled summaries required to the evaluation.
(Step 2) 2. Which measure is better for calculating the similarities between a summary to be evaluated and the pooled summaries ? Kazawa et al used Equation 2 to calculate similarities.
|)||,min (| || ),( xx xx xxSim ij ij ij ?= (2) where xxij ? indicates the number of discourse units1 that appear in both xij and x , and | x | represents the number of words in x.
However , there are many other measures that can be used to calculate the topical similarities between two documents ( or passages).
As well as Yasuda?s method does , using
WH is another way to calculate similarities between a summary to be evaluated and pooled summaries indirectly . Yasuda et al (2003) tested DP matching ( Su et al , 1992), BLEU ( Papineni et al , 2002), and NIST2, for the calculation of WH . However there are many other measures for summary evaluation.

2 http://www.nist.gov/speech/tests/mt/mt2001/resource / calculate the score of a summary to be evaluated ? Kazawa et al used all the pooled summaries but this does not ensure the best performance of their evaluation method.
(Step 3) 4. How to combine the manual scores of the pooled summaries ? Kazawa et al calculated the score of a summary as a weighted linear sum of the manual scores . Applying regression analysis ( Yasuda et al , 2003) is another method of combining several manual scores.
3.2 Three Points Addressed in Our Study
We address the second , third and fourth points in
Section 3.1.
( Point 2) A measure for calculating similarities between a summary to be evaluated and pooled summaries : There are many measures that can calculate the topical similarities between two documents ( or passages ). We tested several measures , such as ROUGE ( Lin , 2004) and the cosine distance . We describe these measures in detail in Section 4.2.
( Point 3) The number of summaries used to calculate the score of a summary to be evaluated : We use summaries whose similarities to a summary to be evaluated are higher than a threshold value.
( Point 4) Combination of manual scores : We used both Kazawa?s and Yasuda?s methods.
4 Experiments 4.1 Experimental Methods
To investigate the three points described in Section 3.2, we conducted the following four experiments.
z Exp1: We examined Points 2 and 3 based on Kazawa?s method . We tested threshold values from 0 to 1 at 0.005 intervals . We also tested several similarity measures , such as cosine distance and 11 kinds of ROUGE.
z Exp2: In order to investigate whether the evaluation based on Kazawa?s method can outperform other automatic methods , we compared the evaluation with other automatic methods . In this experiment , we used the similarity measure , which obtain the best performance in Exp1.
z Exp3: We also examined Point 2 based on Yasuda?s method . As a similarity measure , we tested cosine distance and 11 kinds of
ROUGE . Then , we examined Point 4 by comparing the result of Yasuda?s method with that of Kazawa?s.
z Exp4: In the same way as Exp2, we compared the evaluation with other automatic methods , which we describe in the next section , to investigate whether the evaluation based on Yasuda?s method can outperform other automatic methods.
4.2 Automatic Evaluation Methods Used in the Experiments In the following , we show the automatic evaluation methods used in our experiments.

Content-based evaluation ( Donaway et al , 2000) This measure evaluates summaries by comparing their content words with those of the human-produced extracts . The score of the content-based measure is obtained by computing the similarity between the term vector using tf*idf weighting of a computer-produced summary and the term vector of a human-produced summary by cosine distance.

ROUGE-N ( Lin , 2004)
This measure compares ngrams of two summaries , and counts the number of matches.
The measure is defined by Equation 3.
? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?=?
RS Sgram

N gramCount gramCount
NROUGE )( )( (3) where Count(gramN ) is the number of an Ngram and Countmatch(gramN ) denotes the number of ngram cooccurrences in two summaries.

ROUGEL ( Lin , 2004)
This measure evaluates summaries by longest common subsequence ( LCS ) defined by
Equation 4.
m
CrLCS
LROUGE u ii i ? = ? =? ),( (4) where LCSU(ri,C ) is the LCS score of the union?s longest common subsequence between reference sentences ri and the summary to be evaluated , and m is the number of words contained in a reference summary.
605
ROUGES ( Lin , 2004)
Skip-bigram is any pair of words in their sentence order , allowing for arbitrary gaps.
ROUGES measures the overlap of skip-bigrams in a candidate summary and a reference summary . Several variations of ROUGES are possible by limiting the maximum skip distance between the two inorder words that are allowed to form a skip-bigram . In the following,
ROUGE-SN denotes ROUGES with maximum skip distance N.

ROUGE-SU ( Lin , 2004)
This measure is an extension of ROUGES ; it adds a unigram as a counting unit . In the following , ROUGE-SUN denotes ROUGE-SU with maximum skip distance N.
4.3 Evaluation Methods
In the following , we elaborate on the evaluation methods for each experiment.

Exp1: An experiment for Points 2 and 3 based on Kazawa?s method
We evaluated Kazawa?s method from the viewpoint of ? Gap ?. Differing from other automatic methods , the method uses multiple manual evaluation results and estimates the manual scores of the summaries to be evaluated or the summarization systems . We therefore evaluated the automatic methods using Gap , which manually indicates the difference between the scores from a manual method and each automatic method that estimates the scores . First , an arbitrary summary is selected from the 10 summaries in a dataset , which we describe in Section 4.4, and an evaluation score is calculated by Kazawa?s method using the other nine summaries . The score is compared with a manual score of the summary by Gap , which is defined by Equation 5.
nm yxscr
Gap m k n l klkl ? ? = ?? = =1 1 |)('| (5) where xkl is the kth system?s lth summary , and ykl is the score from a manual evaluation method for the kth system?s lth summary . To distinguish our evaluation function from Kazawa?s , we denote it as scr?(x ). As a similarity measure in scr?(x ), we tested ROUGE and the cosine distance.
We also tested the coverage of the automatic method . The method cannot calculate scores if there are no similar summaries above a given threshold value . Therefore , we checked the coverage of the method , which is defined by
Equation 6.

Coverage = (6)
Exp2: Comparison of Kazawa?s method with other automatic methods Traditionally , automatic methods have been evaluated by ? Ranking ?. This means that summarization systems are ranked based on the results of the automatic and manual methods.
Then , the effectiveness of the automatic method is evaluated by the number of matches between both rankings using Spearman?s rank correlation coefficient and Pearson?s rank correlation coefficient ( Lin et al , 2003, Lin , 2004, Hirao et al ., 2005). However , we did not use both correlation coefficients , because evaluation scores are not always calculated by a Kazawa-based method , which we described in Exp1.
Therefore , we ranked the summaries instead of the summarization systems . Two arbitrary summaries from the 10 summaries in a dataset were selected and ranked by Kazawa?s method.
Then , Kazawa?s method was evaluated using ? Precision ,? which calculates the percentage of cases where the order of the manual method of the two summaries matches the order of their ranks calculated by Kazawa?s method . The two summaries were also ranked by ROUGE and by cosine distance , and both Precision values were calculated . Finally , the Precision value of Kazawa?s method was compared with those of
ROUGE and cosine distance.
Exp3: An experiment for Point 2 based on
Yasuda?s method
An arbitrary system was selected from the 10 systems , and Yasuda?s method estimated its manual score from the other nine systems.
Yasuda?s method was evaluated by Gap , which is defined by Equation 7.
m yxs
Gap m k kk ? = ? = 1 |)(| (7) where xk is the kth system , s(xk ) is a score of xk by Yasuda?s method , and yk is the manual score for the kth system . Yasuda et al (2003) tested DP matching ( Su et al , 1992), BLEU ( Papineni et al , 2002), and NIST3, as automatic methods used in their evaluation . Instead of those methods , we 3 http://www.nist.gov/speech/tests/mt/mt2001/resource / which have been used for summary evaluation.
If a score by Yasuda?s method exceeds the range of the manual score , the score is modified to be within the range . In our experiments , we used evaluation by revision ( Fukushima et al , 2002) as the manual evaluation method . The range of the score of this method is between zero and 0.5. If the score is less than zero , it is changed to zero and if greater than 0.5 it is changed to 0.5.
Exp4: Comparison of Yasuda?s method and other automatic methods In the same way as for the evaluation of Kazawa?s method in Exp2, we evaluated Yasuda?s method by Precision . Two arbitrary summaries from the 10 summaries in a dataset were selected , and ranked by Yasuda?s method.
Then , Yasuda?s method was evaluated using Precision . Two summaries were also ranked by
ROUGE and by cosine distance and both
Precision values were calculated . Finally , the Precision value of Yasuda?s method was compared with those of ROUGE and cosine distance.
4.4 The Data Used in Our Experiments
We used the TSC-2 data ( Fukushima et al , 2002) in our examinations . The data consisted of human-produced extracts ( denoted as ? PART ?), human-produced abstracts ( denoted as ? FREE ?), computer-produced summaries ( eight systems and a baseline system using the lead method ( denoted as ? LEAD ?)) 4 , and their evaluation results by two manual methods . All the summaries were derived from 30 newspaper articles , written in Japanese , and were extracted from the Mainichi newspaper database for the years 1998 and 1999. Two tasks were conducted in TSC-2, and we used the data from a single document summarization task . In this task , participants were asked to produce summaries in plain text in the ratios of 20% and 40%.
Summaries were evaluated using a ranking evaluation method and the revision method evaluation . In our experiments , we used the results of evaluation from the revision method.
This method evaluates summaries by measuring the degree to which computer-produced summaries are revised . The judges read the 4 In Exp2 and 4, we evaluated ? PART ?, ? LEAD ?, and eight systems ( candidate summaries ) by automatic methods using ? FREE ? as the reference summaries.
original texts and revised the computer-produced summaries in terms of their content and readability . The human revisions were made with only three editing operations ( insertion , deletion , replacement ). The degree of the human revision , called the ? edit distance ,? is computed from the number of revised characters divided by the number of characters in the original summary . If the summary?s quality was so low that a revision of more than half of the original summary was required , the judges stopped the revision and a score of 0.5 was given.
The effectiveness of evaluation by the revision method was confirmed in our previous work ( Nanba et al , 2004). We compared evaluation by revision with ranking evaluation . We also tested other automatic methods : content-based evaluation , BLEU ( Papineni et al , 2001) and ROUGE1 ( Lin , 2004), and compared their results with that of evaluation by revision as reference . As a result , we found that evaluation by revision is effective for recognizing slight differences between computer-produced summaries.
4.5 Experimental Results and Discussion
Exp1: An experiment for Points 2 and 3 based on Kazawa?s method To address Points 2 and 3, we evaluated summaries by the method based on Kazawa?s method using 12 measures , described in Section 4.4, as measures to calculate topical similarities between summaries , and compared these measures by Gap . The experimental results for summarization ratios of 40% and 20% are shown in Tables 1 and 2, respectively . Tables show the Gap values of 12 measures for each Coverage value from 0.2 to 1.0 at 0.1 intervals.
Average values of Gap for each measure are also shown in these tables . As can be seen from Tables 1 and 2, the larger the threshold value , the smaller the value of Gap . From the result , we can conclude for Point 3 that more accurate evaluation is possible when we use similar pooled summaries ( Point 2). However , the number of summaries that can be evaluated by this method was limited when the threshold value was large.
Of the 12 measures , unigram-based methods , such as cosine distance and ROUGE1, produced good results . However , there were no significant differences between measures except for when
ROUGEL was used.

We therefore used cosine distance in Kazawa?s method in Exp2. We ranked summaries by Kazawa?s method , ROUGE and cosine distance , calculated using Precision.
The results of the evaluation by Precision for summarization ratios of 40% and 20% are shown in Figures 1 and 2, respectively . We plotted the Precision value of Kazawa?s method by changing the threshold value from 0 to 1 at 0.05 intervals.
We also plotted the Precision values of ROUGE2 as dotted lines . ROUGE2 was superior to the other 11 measures in terms of Ranking . The X and Y axes in Figures 1 and 2 show the threshold value of Kazawa?s method and the Precision values , respectively . From the result shown in Figure 1, we found that Kazawa?s method outperformed ROUGE2, when the threshold value was greater than 0.968. The Coverage value of this point was 0.203. In Figure 2, the Precision curve of Kazawa?s method crossed the dotted line at a threshold value of 0.890. The Coverage value of this point was 0.405.
To improve these Coverage values , we need to prepare more summaries and their manual evaluation results , because the Coverage is critically dependent on the number and variety of pooled summaries . This is exactly the first point in Section 3.1, which we do not address in this paper . We will investigate this point as the next step in our future work.

Exp3: An experiment for Point 3 based on
Yasuda?s method
For Point 2 in Section 3.2, we also examined Yasuda?s method . The experimental result by Gap is shown in Table 3. When the ratio is 20%, ROUGE-SU4 is the best . The Ngram and the skip-bigram are both useful when the summarization ratio is low.
For Point 4, we compared the result by
Yasuda?s method ( Table 3) with that of
Kazawa?s method ( in Tables 1 and 2). Yasuda?s method could accurately estimate manual scores.
In particular , the Gap values of 0.023 by ROUGE2 and by ROUGE3 are smaller than those produced by Kazawa?s method with a threshold value of 0.9 ( Tables 1 and 2). This indicates that regression analysis used in Yasuda?s method is superior to that used in
Kazawa?s method.

Exp4: Comparison of Yasuda?s method with other automatic methods
We also evaluated Yasuda?s method by comparison with other automatic methods in terms of Ranking . We evaluated 10 systems by
Yasuda?s method with ROUGE3, which produced the best results in Exp3. We also evaluated the systems by ROUGE and cosine distance , and compared the results . The results are shown in Table 4.

As can be seen from Table 4, Yasuda?s method produced the best results for the ratios of 20% and 40%. Of the automatic methods compared,
ROUGE4 was the best.
609
As evaluation scores by Yasuda?s method were calculated based on ROUGE3, there were no striking differences between Yasuda?s method and the others except for the integration process of evaluation scores for each summary . Yasuda?s method uses a regression analysis , whereas the other methods average the scores for each summary . Yasuda?s method using ROUGE3 outperformed the original ROUGE3 for both ratios , 20% and 40%.
5 Conclusions
We have investigated an automatic method that uses several evaluation results from a manual method based on Kazawa?s and Yasuda?s methods . From the experimental results based on Kazawa?s method , we found that limiting the number of pooled summaries could produce better results than using all the pooled summaries.
However , the number of summaries that can be evaluated by this method was limited . To improve the Coverage of Kazawa?s method , more summaries and their evaluation results are required , because the Coverage is critically dependent on the number and variety of pooled summaries.
We also investigated an automatic method based on Yasuda?s method and found that the method using ROUGE2 and -3 could accurately estimate manual scores , and could outperform Kazawa?s method and the other automatic methods tested . From these results , we can conclude that the automatic method performed the best when ROUGE2 or 3 is used as a similarity measure , and a regression analysis is used for combining manual method.
