EXTENDED ABSTRACT **
There is renewed interest in examining the descriptive as well as generative power of phrase s~-~uctur ~ grammars  . The primary motivation has come from the recent investigations in alternatives to t-~ans for ~ational gremmm rs\[e  . g . , i , 2, 3, 4\] . We will present several results and ideas related to phrase structure trees which have significant relevance to computational linguistics  . 
We % ~_nT to accomplish several objectives in this paper  . 
I . We will give a hrief survey of some recent results and approaches by various investigators including  , of course , our own work ~ indicating their interr ~ latic n -ships  . 
Here we will review the work related to the notion of node admissibility starring with Chomsky  ) followed by the work by McCawley , Peters and Ritchie , Joshi and
Levy , a ~ dmore recent work of Gazdar.
We will also discuss other amendments to contextfree grammars which increase the descriptive power but not the generative power  . In particular , we will discuss the notion of categories with holes as recently introduced by Gazdam \  [3\]   . There is an interesting history behind this notion  . Sage ~' sparser explieitly exploits such a convention and  , in fact , uses it to do some coordina test-ruct nK-a computation  . We suspect that some other parsers have this feature also  , perhaps ~ plicit-ly . We will discuss this matter , which obviously is of great interes~to computational linguists  . 
2 . Our work on local constraints on st-r~/cin/ral descriptions  ,  \[5 ,  6\] , which is ccmputationally relevant both to linguistics and programming language theory  , has art-~' acted some attention recently ; however , the demon-srration of these results has re ~ . ained somewhat in ac-cessible to many due to the technicalities of the tree automata theory  . Recently , we have found a way of providing an intuitive explanation of these results in terms of intel " acting finite state machines  ( of the , usual kind ) . Besides providing an intuitive and a more transparent explanation of our results  , this approach is computationally more interesting and allows us to formulate an interesting question : How large a variable set  ( i . e . , the set of nonterminals ) is required for a phrase slx ~ cture grammar or how much information does a nonterm dmalencode ? We will present this new approach  . 
3 . We will present some new results which extend the " po~er " of local constraints without affecting the chax ~ acter of earlier results  . In particular , we will show That local constraints can include , besides the pmope ~ analysis ( PA ) predicates and domination ( ~ ) pmadicates , * This work was partially supported by NSF grant MCS79-08401  . 
** Full paper will be available at the time of the meeting  . 
mor ~ complex predicates of the following form.
(1) ( PREDN 1N2 . . . Nn ) where NI , N2, . . . Nn are nonterminals mentioned in the PA and/or ~ constraint of the rule in which  ( i ) appears and PR ~ is a predicate which , r ~ ughly speaking , checks fo~certain domination or left-of ( or right-of ) rela-Tionships among its arguments . Two examples of in Ter~est are as follows . 
(2) ( CCOFMANDABC )
C C0~LND holds if B immediately dominates A and B dominates C  , not necessarily ~ iately . Usually the B node is an S node . 
(3) ( LEFT MOST SISTERAB)
LEFT MOSTSISTER holds if A is the leftmost sister of B  . 
We will show that introduction of predicates of the type  ( I ) do not change the character of our result on local cons ~- raints  . This extension of our earlier work has relevance to the for Tm~ation of some long distance rules without %-mansformations  ( as well as without the use of The categories with holes as suggested by Gazdar  )  . 
We will discuss some of the processing as well as linguistic relevance of these results  . 
4 . We will tr~y to compare ( at least along two dimensions ) the local const-raint approach to that of Gazdar ' s  ( specifically his use of categories with holes ) and to that of Peters ' use of linked nodes ( as presented orally at Stanford recently )  . 
The dimensions for cc~is on would be ( a ) economy of representation , ( b ) proliferation of categories , by and large semantically vacuous , and ( c ) computational relevance of ( a ) and ( b ) above . 
5 . Co~positional semantics \[8\] is usually contextfree , i . e . , if nodes B and C are immediate descendants of node A  , then the semantics of A is a composition ( defined appropriately ) of the semantics of B and semantics of C . Semantics of A depends only on nodes B and C and not on any other part of the st-rue rural description in which A may appear  . Our method of local constraints ( and to sQme extent Peters ' use of linked nodes ) opens the possibility of defining the semantics of A not only in terms of the semantics of B and C  , but also in terms of sc~eparts of the sZ~-uc ~ description in which A appears  . In this sense , the semantics will be contex-t-sensitive . We have achieved some success with This a FpLuaeh to the semantics of progr~g languages  . We will discuss someofou ~ preliminary ideas for extending this approach to natural language  , in particular , in specifying scopes for variable binding . 
6 . While developing our theory of local constrains and some other related work  , we have discovered that it is possible to characterize structural descriptions  ( for phrases l-r~cruregz % m ~ mars ) entirely in terms of trees without any labels , i . e . , trees which capture the grouping structure wi ~hou ~ the syntactic categories  ( which is the same as the constitn/ent st-r~cture without the node labels  \[7\]  . This is a surprising result . This result ~ zerm/nels ( syntactic caze Eories ) encode and therefore clearly , it hasca~atic nalsi ~ i cance . 
Moreover , ~o The extent That The cla/m~ha ~ natural languages ere conzex ~- bree is valid  , this result has significant z~levancs to leamabili ~ y ~\] ~ eories  , because our result suEges ~ s that it might be possible to " infer " a phrases ~ ruc ' ~ r  , e~L , - , , jus ~ the grouping s~ruc~ure of ~ he input ( i . e . , jus ~ phrase boundaries ) . Pur~her , the set of descrip ~ iuns wit . bout labels are directly rela~ed to the ~ descz'ip ~ ic~s of a contextfree Eramn ~ z-  ; hence , we may be able to specify ' ~ a Tural " syntactic categories  . 
In summery , we will prese~1: a selectian of mathematical resul:s which have s is n if j ~ l n t z ~ l  . evancs to m = ~ y a spec ~ of con ~ tionallin ~ is ~ ics .
