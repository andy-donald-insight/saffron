1. Introduction
This report descrnbes Paul . a computer text generation system designed to cre ~: tecolle sive text throughtile use of lexical substitutuons  . 
Spec ; hcalty . thts system~s designed tn deterministically choose between pronominal : zabonsup  ( : rordinate substitution , and delinite noun phrase reitcraton . Fl~e system identifies a strength at antecedence recovery for each of the lexical substitutions  , antimatches them against the strength of poten U ,  #entececJence of each element = n the text to select the proper  sub3litubons for these elements . 
P~ul is a natural language generation program initially developed at IBM's Thomas J  . Watson Research Center as part of the ongoing Epistle project  I5  . 6 , "\ [ heemphasis of the the work reported here is in the research oJ discourse phenomena  , the study of cohesion and its effects on mLJlh sentia texts  \[3  ,  9\] . Paul accepts as input LISP knowledge structures consisbng of case frame  l1\] formalisms representing each sentence to be gernerated  . These knowledge structures are translated into Enghsh  , with the appropriate lexical substitutions being made at this time  . 
No attempt vs made by the system to create these knowledge structures  . 
2. Cohesion
The purpose of communication is for one person ( the speaker or writer ) to express her thoughts and ideas so that another  ( the listener or reader ) can understand them . \] here a Jemany restrictions placed on the realization of these thoughts iniolanguage so that the listener may understand  . One ot the most important requiroments fo ~ an utterance is that it seem to be unified  , that it form a text . The theory of text and what distinguishes it from isolated sentences that is used in Paul is that of 
Halliday and Hasan\[3\].
One of the items that enhances the unity of text is cohesion  . 
Cohesion refers to the linguistic phenomena that establish relationships between sentences  , thc ~ rebytying them together . There are two major goals that are accomplished tl ~ rougi ~ cohesiu  , that enhance a passage's qualily of text . The fiust is the obwousoesure to avoid unnecessary repetibon  . The other goal is to disling uL " , hnew information from old .   , so that the listener cantully undemt and whatfs being said  . 
\[1 The room has a large window , The room has a window facing east . 
1 appears to he describing two windows , because there is no device indicating that the window of the second sentence is the same as the window of tile first sentence  . If intact the speaker me:mr to describe the stonew  ; n do w , silo must somehow in form the listener that this is  1This research wass . pported ( in part ) by Office of Naval Research contract NO014-80-C . 0505 , an J ( inpint ) by Nation 31 Institutes of I-le 31lh Grant No . 1 POtLM 0 33 74 . 04 from the National Library of Medicine . 
indeed the case . Cohesion usa device that will accomplish thas goal  , Cohesion is created when the interpretation of an element is dependent on theme  . aning of another . \] he element in guestion can . at behJIly understood until 1he element d is dependen lonzs ~ d cnt dned . rhefirst presupposes \[3\] the second in that it requ , es for its understanding the exnstence of the second  . An element at a sentence presupposes the existence of another when its interpretation requires relerence tO another  . Once we can trace these lelerences to their sources  , we can correctly interprethe elements of the sentences  . 
The very same devices that create these depende , leies for interpretation help distinguish olct intolrnation from new  . I\[the use of a cohesive element pre ~ . upposes the exnste~ce of another role = once el the element lor it sirter pretahon  , tl ~ entile hstener can be assured tlt at the olher reference exists  , and that the element = n question can be understood as old reformation  . lhurefore , that act at associating seJltences through reference depond e  . ciesheips make the text unambiguous , arid cohcs = on can be seen to be a very important part of text  . 
3. Lexical Substitution
In \[3\], Halliday and I-lasan cat . ~log and discuss many devices used in English to acmove cohes  , on . Fhese include refe ; ence , substitution ella Ds is , and conjunction . Another f . t , milyut devices they discuss is know , -" as lexical substitulion . \] he lexlcal substitution devices incorporated into Paul are pronommalizatior  , , s . perordinate substitution , and definite noun phrase reiteration . 
Superordinate substitution is the replacement of an etement with a noun or phrase that psa  . ; or e general term for the element As an example , consP der Figure 1 , a sample hierarchy the system uses to generate sentences  .

\] + he reason these superordinates have negative connalations is that there are e~sent Kdquahttes that hH +  ; rans p , ': , ssess that s , + p ~; rate , is from ell ; or animals .

Paul is senmtive to the connot abons that are possible Ihrough superordinate substitubon  . The+systemt de obfies an es;~e+~tial quality , usu\[\]liyir = telligence , wilich acts as a block for further supurordinate subsbtution  . If the item to be replaced with a superord mate has the prou  . ~rty of intelhgence , either d~reclly or through semantic inheritance , a superordinate list is made only ) f tho . .:e entnes that have themselves the quality el into thg enco  , aj . qir , either d ~ rectly or through inheritance . If the item does = r t have intelhgence the list is allowed to extend as far as the hierarcl~ical entries will allow  . Once the proper list of superordinates =3 established , Paul randomly chooses one , preventing repetition by remembering previous choices  . 
The other problem with superordinato substitution is that it may = ntroduce ambiguity  . Again cons = tier Figure 1 . If we wanted to perform a superord . \]ato subshhlho ; + for POrJO . we would have the sup ~' rordJt 13te hst ( POS SUMM AMMAL ANIM 4L ) to choose from . But HEPZl I\]AH is also an lammal , so the rnammal cauld refer to either POGO or HEPZIBAH  . And not only are both POG Oe , rd It EPZIBA tlanunals , but sn is CtlURCHY , so the arm nat could be anyo , e of them . \] herefore , saying lhem at nmal or the arr + mal would form an ambiguous refecence which the listener or reader would have riov  , , , aytour ~ derstand . 
Paulreco . lniz ? ?\ [ hts ambiguity . Once the superordinate has been selected , it~s tested against all the other nour ~ s mentioned so far in the text If any other noun is arn  ; mbetofth . esuper or du + alesetm question , the reference is ambl , ~! uous .   1his reference can be disarn biguated by using some feature ot theeh : ment be  , to replaced as a modilier . In our example of Figure 1 . we hrd that all possums are grey . and therefore POGO~s grey . Thus . the grey mamma ! can refer only to POGO , and is not at nb = guous . In the Pogow or ld , the features the system uses to d~sarr ; oiuuate these references are gender , s ~ ze , color , and skintype(furry . scaled , of foath , ~(' d) . Or + coth eleature ~ sarb ~ trC . rily selected and the correct value has been determined  . ~t~stested to see that it genuinely diba+nb ~guales the reference  , ttany of the nouns that were members of the : , t ; pcrordmate set have the same value to ~ this feature  , it cannot be use , ') to(f~s . ~mb ~ guate the reference , aridil is relected . For instance , tl ~ e size of POGO~s small , buts ~ ying the . ~ n ' , all mammal ~3 still ambiguous bec~use HEP Zll~Atlis also small , and the phrase could just as likely refer to her . The search for a disambiguatm gieature continues until one is found  . 
Pronominalizat + on , the use of personal pronouns in place of an element  , is mechan~c ~ dly simple . The selecbon of the appropriate persnnal pronoun is strictly gramm  ; - ~ lical . Once lhesyntactic case , theo endor , and the number of the element are known , the correct pronoun is dictated by the language . 
the final ~ ex ~ cal substitution available to Paul is the definite noun phrase  , the use of a dehnite artiel r ~ , t , ' ~ em English , as opposed to an indefinlle article , a or some The definite ~ rticle clearly marks an item a serie that has been pre  , ~iously mentioned , and is therefore old information . 
" f :', e . ' ~ rlefu , te oracle 31mllatiy marks an item as not havl nq been pre . .qc~usiy mentioned . , ~ d therefore is new information .   1"his capacity of the defimte article makes ilsuse required with superordinates  .

Willie the mocharlisms for performing the various lexical substitutions are conceptualiys lra ~ghtforward  , they don't solve the entire problot nufus in ~ . le , : icdlsuOstltuhon . Nolhing has been said about how the system chooses WlllChIOxICUl substilutlor'i to use  . This is a serious issue because lexl cGI s LJbsb tutiol ~ dOW CO Sacenc  ; t interchangeable . This is tru . ,3 , bec ; ~ u : ; ele ~ J cal substiluhons , as Wltllmost cohesive devices , create text by using pze : ; uppo-~t ; d dependencies to rIheir in lerp reti'tioi1s , as we have seer i . If those pr ? ~ Supposo deleme ats do not exist , or if it is not possible to Correctly id cnhly whtch of them ~'  . nypossiDle elements is the one presuppns, . xi , then it is i moossiblo to correctly in t ( , r prethe element , arid the only poss d . ) ler?su ! t~scunlus ~ on . A computer text generation symptommat incorporates lexical substituh on in its output must insure that tnepresupposed element ex:sts  , and that it can be readily identified by the reader  . 
Pa~dcontrols these ! ection of lexicai substitution devices by conceptually dividing the p + helen rote two I '  . , sks . "rho first is to ~ dentify the strength of antecedence rucov ' cr v of to O lexical substitution devices  . The second ~ s to iderz tffy the str ~ . .ngth el pote~:hal arrteceder~ce of each element in the passage  , and determine which il any Icxical substitution would be appropriate  . 
4. Strength of Antecedence Recovery
Each time a cohesive devic ~ is used , a presupposition clependency is created . rheitef ~ tIlati: ; being presupposed must be correctly identified tor the correct interp ~ et abon of the element  . The relative ease with wh = chone c3n recover this pre~supposed item from the cohesive element is called the strengthelant ecedence recove  , y . The stronger a neleraent's strength of antecedence recovery  , the easier it is to identify the presupposed element  . 
The lexical substitution with the highest strength of antece-lonce recovery is the dehnite noun  . This is because the element is actually a recetition of the original item  , w~thade finite article to mark the fact that it is old information  . There is no real need to refer to the presupposed element  , since all the reformation is being repeated . 
Superordinate subslitution is the lexical substitution witl  ; the next highest strength of antecedence recovery  . Presupposition oe pondency genuinely doesernst with I he use of superordmates  , because some into rrnation is lost When w*~ . move up the semanhchierarchy , all the traits that are specih c to the element in question are test  . To recover this and fully understand the ret ( ; rence at Ilano . we must trace back to the original element in the hierarchy  . Fortunately , the manner in which Paulpedorms suporord mate substitution faohtates this recovery  . By insunng that the superordmate substitt ; tlon will never be ambiguous , the system only generates supor of dmate ~ L , bstt tutlons that are readily recoverable . 
Theth , d device used by Paul . ~ he personal pronoun , has the lowest strength of antecedence recovery . Pronouns genuinely ~ renothing more tharl plat : e holders  , variables that lea=t Hole the pnsi hotlsOf the elements they are replacing A pronoun contains no realse mahh cirdormation  . The only readily available p~eces of iniormation from a pronoun are the syntactic role Jn the currenl sentence  , the gender , and the number of the replaced item . For this mason , pronouns are the hardest to recover of the substitutions discussed  . 
5. Strength of Potential Antecedence
Wl~tle the forms of lexical substitution provide clues  ( tO various degrees ) teat aid the reader in recovering the presupposed elemeflt  , the actual waym which the e ! or r ; er ; t = Scurrerttly being used , how ; t was prev ; :) usly used . its cir , ,:um , ~tances within the current sentence and within the eqt ~ retext  , can prowce add it ; on 31 clues . These factors combine to give tne 5pecIhc reference as ~ ret ; g the l potentiatant ecedence . Some etemer ~ ts , try the ; , a ture of their current and previous us ~ . ~ge , will be easier to recover u ; depet l ~ ont of u ~ e fox , cat subst~lutton dewce selected . 
Strength of potential antecedence involves several factors  , One is the syntach crole the element ~ spl ~ ying int recurrent sentence  , as well as in the previous relere ; ice . A noti~er is the d~stance of the previous reference from the current  . He redistance is defined as the number of clauses between the references  , and Paul arbitrarily uses a distance of no more than two clauses as an acceptable distance  . The current expected antecedence . In order to identify the current expected locus , Paul uses the detailed algorithm for focus developed by Sidner  \[10\]  . 
Paul identifies five classes of potenhal antecedence strength  . Class I being the strongest and Class V the weakest  , as well as a sixth " non-class " for elements being mentioned for the first time  . These five classes are shown in Figure 2 . 
Class h1 . The sole referent of a given gender and number ( singular or plural ) last menbo ~ lod within an acceptable distance . OR2 . The locus or the head of the expected locus list for the previous sentence  . 
Class Ih
The last relerent elag = vengender and number last mentioned w  ; thin an acceptable distance . 
Class IIh
An element that filled the same syntactic role in the previous sentence  . 
Class IV : 1 . A referent that has been previously mentioned , OR2 . A referent that is a member of a previously mentioned set that has been mentioned within an acceptable distance  . 
Class V :
A referent that is known to be a part of a previously mentioned item  .

Note that Class I11 elements are unusuali ~ that the device used to replace them can vary  . If the previous instance of the element was of Chtss I  . if it was replaced with a pronoun , then the Cunent instance=s replaced with a pror ~ oun  , too .

An Example To see the effects of controlled lexical substitution  , and to help clarify the ideas discussed , an example is provided . The following is an actual example of text generated by Paul Tile domain is the socalled children's story  , and the example discussed here is one about characters frorn Walt Kelly's Pogocomic strip  , as shown in Figure 1 above .

If the SIO Fy were to be generated without any lexical subslitutions at all  , it would look like the following .

While this version of the story would be unacceptable a stile final product of a text generator '  , and it is not the text Paul would produce from the input of Figure  4  . it is shown here so that the reader can more easily understand the storyrei Jros onted semantically in Figure  4  .

Again . this is unacceptable text . and the system would not generate it , but it is shown hero to dramatize the need for control over lexical substitutions  .
