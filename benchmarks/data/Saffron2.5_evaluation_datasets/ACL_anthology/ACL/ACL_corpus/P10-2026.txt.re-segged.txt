Abstract
This paper presents a novel filtration criterion to restrict the rule extraction for the hierarchical phrasebased translation model , where a bilingual but relaxed wellformed dependency restriction is used to filter out bad rules . Furthermore , a new feature which describes the regularity that the source/target dependency edge triggers the target/source word is also proposed . Experimental results show that , the new criteria weeds out about 40% rules while with translation performance improvement , and the new feature brings another improvement to the baseline system , especially on larger corpus.
1 Introduction
Hierarchical phrasebased ( HPB ) model ( Chiang , 2005) is the state-of-the-art statistical machine translation ( SMT ) model . By looking for phrases that contain other phrases and replacing the subphrases with nonterminal symbols , it gets hierarchical rules . Hierarchical rules are more powerful than conventional phrases since they have better generalization capability and could capture long distance reordering . However , when the training corpus becomes larger , the number of rules will grow exponentially , which inevitably results in slow and memory-consuming decoding.
In this paper , we address the problem of reducing the hierarchical translation rule table resorting to the dependency information of bilingual languages . We only keep rules that both sides are relaxed-well-formed ( RWF ) dependency structure ( see the definition in Section 3), and discard others which do not satisfy this constraint . In this way , about 40% bad rules are weeded out from the original rule table . However , the performance is even better than the traditional HPB translation system.
Source
Target f f ? e
Figure 1: Solid wire reveals the dependency relation pointing from the child to the parent . Target word e is triggered by the source word f and it?s head word f ?, p(e|f ? f ?).
Based on the relaxed-well-formed dependency structure , we also introduce a new linguistic feature to enhance translation performance . In the traditional phrasebased SMT model , there are always lexical translation probabilities based on IBM model 1 ( Brown et al , 1993), i.e . p(e|f ), namely , the target word e is triggered by the source word f . Intuitively , however , the generation of e is not only involved with f , sometimes may also be triggered by other context words in the source side . Here we assume that the dependency edge ( f ? f ?) of word f generates target word e ( we call it head word trigger in Section 4). Therefore , two words in one language trigger one word in another , which provides a more sophisticated and better choice for the target word , i.e . Figure 1.
Similarly , the dependency feature works well in Chinese-to-English translation task , especially on large corpus.
2 Related Work
In the past , a significant number of techniques have been presented to reduce the hierarchical rule table . He et al (2009) just used the key phrases of source side to filter the rule table without taking advantage of any linguistic information . Iglesias et al (2009) put rules into syntactic classes based on the number of nonterminals and patterns , and applied various filtration strategies to improve the rule table quality . Shen et al (2008) discarded

most entries of the rule table by using the constraint that rules of the target-side are wellformed ( WF ) dependency structure , but this filtering led to degradation in translation performance . They obtained improvements by adding an additional dependency language model . The basic difference of our method from ( Shen et al , 2008) is that we keep rules that both sides should be relaxed-well-formed dependency structure , not just the target side . Besides , our system complexity is not increased because no additional language model is introduced.
The feature of head word trigger which we apply to the loglinear model is motivated by the trigger-based approach ( Hasan and Ney , 2009).
Hasan and Ney (2009) introduced a second word to trigger the target word without considering any linguistic information . Furthermore , since the second word can come from any part of the sentence , there may be a prohibitively large number of parameters involved . Besides , He et al (2008) built a maximum entropy model which combines rich context information for selecting translation rules during decoding . However , as the size of the corpus increases , the maximum entropy model will become larger . Similarly , In ( Shen et al , 2009), context language model is proposed for better rule selection . Taking the dependency edge as condition , our approach is very different from previous approaches of exploring context information.
3 Relaxed-well-formed Dependency
Structure
Dependency models have recently gained considerable interest in SMT ( Ding and Palmer , 2005; Quirk et al , 2005; Shen et al , 2008). Dependency tree can represent richer structural information . It reveals long-distance relation between words and directly models the semantic structure of a sentence without any constituent labels . Figure 2 shows an example of a dependency tree . In this example , the word found is the root of the tree.
Shen et al (2008) propose the wellformed dependency structure to filter the hierarchical rule table . A wellformed dependency structure could be either a single-rooted dependency tree or a set of sibling trees . Although most rules are discarded with the constraint that the target side should be wellformed , this filtration leads to degradation in translation performance.
As an extension of the work of ( Shen et al ., 2008), we introduce the socalled relaxed-well-formed dependency structure to filter the hierarchical rule table . Given a sentence S = w1w2...wn . Let d1d2...dn represent the position of parent word for each word . For example , d3 = 4 means that w3 depends on w4. If wi is a root , we define di = ?1.
Definition A dependency structure wi...wj is a relaxed-well-formed structure , where there is h /? [ i , j ], all the words wi...wj are directly or indirectly depended on wh or -1 ( here we define h = ?1). If and only if it satisfies the following conditions ? dh /? [ i , j ] ? ? k ? [ i , j ], dk ? [ i , j ] or dk = h From the definition above , we can see that the relaxed-well-formed structure obviously covers the wellformed one . In this structure , we don?t constrain that all the children of the subroot should be complete . Let?s review the dependency tree in Figure 2 as an example . Except for the wellformed structure , we could also extract girl found a beautiful house . Therefore , if the modifier The lovely changes to The cute , this rule also works.
4 Head Word Trigger ( Koehn et al , 2003) introduced the concept of lexical weighting to check how well words of the phrase translate to each other . Source word f aligns with target word e , according to the IBM model 1, the lexical translation probability is p(e|f ). However , in the sense of dependency relationship , we believe that the generation of the target word e , is not only triggered by the aligned source word f , but also associated with f ? s head word f ?. Therefore , the lexical translation probability becomes p(e|f ? f ?), which of course allows for a more finegrained lexical choice of ity could be estimated by the maximum likelihood ( MLE ) approach , p(e|f ? f ?) = count(e , f ? f ?) ? e ? count(e ?, f ? f ?) (1) Given a phrase pair f , e and word alignment a , and the dependent relation of the source sentence dJ1 ( J is the length of the source sentence , I is the length of the target sentence ). Therefore , given the lexical translation probability distribution p(e|f ? f ?), we compute the feature score of a phrase pair ( f , e ) as p(e|f , dJ1 , a ) = ?| e|i=1 ? ?( j,i)?a p(ei|fj ? fdj ) (2) Now we get p(e|f , dJ1 , a ), we could obtain p(f | e , dI1, a ) ( dI1 represents dependent relation of the target side ) in the similar way . This new feature can be easily integrated into the loglinear model as lexical weighting does.
5 Experiments
In this section , we describe the experimental setting used in this work , and verify the effect of the relaxed-well-formed structure filtering and the new feature , head word trigger.
5.1 Experimental Setup
Experiments are carried out on the NIST1 ChineseEnglish translation task with two different size of training corpora.
? FBIS : We use the FBIS corpus as the first training corpus , which contains 239K sentence pairs with 6.9M Chinese words and 8.9M English words.
? GQ : This is manually selected from the LDC2 corpora . GQ contains 1.5M sentence pairs with 41M Chinese words and 48M English words . In fact , FBIS is the subset of
GQ.
1www.nist.gov/speech/tests/mt 2It consists of six LDC corpora : LDC2002E18, LDC2003E07, LDC2003E14, Hansards part of LDC2004T07, LDC2004T08, LDC2005T06.
For language model , we use the SRI Language Modeling Toolkit ( Stolcke , 2002) to train a 4gram model on the first 1/3 of the Xinhua portion of GIGAWORD corpus . And we use the NIST 2002 MT evaluation test set as our development set , and NIST 2004, 2005 test sets as our blind test sets . We evaluate the translation quality using case-insensitive BLEU metric ( Papineni et al ., 2002) without dropping OOV words , and the feature weights are tuned by minimum error rate training ( Och , 2003).
In order to get the dependency relation of the training corpus , we reimplement a beamsearch style monolingual dependency parser according to ( Nivre and Scholz , 2004). Then we use the same method suggested in ( Chiang , 2005) to extract SCFG grammar rules within dependency constraint on both sides except that unaligned words are allowed at the edge of phrases . Parameters of head word trigger are estimated as described in Section 4. As a default , the maximum initial phrase length is set to 10 and the maximum rule length of the source side is set to 5. Besides , we also reimplement the decoder of Hiero ( Chiang , 2007) as our baseline . In fact , we just exploit the dependency structure during the rule extraction phase . Therefore , we don?t need to change the main decoding algorithm of the SMT system.
5.2 Results on FBIS Corpus
A series of experiments was done on the FBIS corpus . We first parse the bilingual languages with monolingual dependency parser respectively , and then only retain the rules that both sides are in line with the constraint of dependency structure . In Table 1, the relaxed-well-formed structure filtered out 35% of the rule table and the wellformed discarded 74%. RWF extracts additional 39% compared to WF , which can be seen as some kind of evidence that the rules we additional get seem common in the sense of linguistics . Compared to ( Shen et al , 2008), we just use the dependency structure to constrain rules , not to maintain the tree structures to guide decoding.
Table 2 shows the translation result on FBIS.
We can see that the RWF structure constraint can improve translation quality substantially both at development set and different test sets . On the Test04 task , it gains +0.86% BLEU , and +0.84% on Test05. Besides , we also used Shen et al (2008)?s WF structure to filter both sides . Although it discard about 74% of the rule table , the

overall BLEU is decreased by 0.66%-0.78% on the test sets.
As for the feature of head word trigger , it seems not work on the FBIS corpus . On Test05, it gets the same score with the baseline , but lower than RWF filtering . This may be caused by the data sparseness problem , which results in inaccurate parameter estimation of the new feature.
5.3 Result on GQ Corpus
In this part , we increased the size of the training corpus to check whether the feature of head word trigger works on large corpus.
We get 152M rule entries from the GQ corpus according to ( Chiang , 2007)?s extraction method.
If we use the RWF structure to constrain both sides , the number of rules is 87M , about 43% of rule entries are discarded . From Table 3, the new

Table 3: Results of GQ corpus . * or ** = significantly better than baseline ( p < 0.05 or 0.01, respectively).
feature works well on two different test sets . The gain is +2.21% BLEU on Test04, and +1.33% on Test05. Compared to the result of the baseline , only using the RWF structure to filter performs the same as the baseline on Test05, and +0.99% gains on Test04.
6 Conclusions
This paper proposes a simple strategy to filter the hierarchal rule table , and introduces a new feature to enhance the translation performance . We employ the relaxed-well-formed dependency structure to constrain both sides of the rule , and about 40% of rules are discarded with improvement of the translation performance . In order to make full use of the dependency information , we assume that the target word e is triggered by dependency edge of the corresponding source word f . And this feature works well on large parallel training corpus.
How to estimate the probability of head word trigger is very important . Here we only get the parameters in a generative way . In the future , we we are plan to exploit some discriminative approach to train parameters of this feature , such as EM algorithm ( Hasan et al , 2008) or maximum entropy ( He et al , 2008).
Besides , the quality of the parser is another effect for this method . As the next step , we will try to exploit bilingual knowledge to improve the monolingual parser , i.e . ( Huang et al , 2009).
