Abstract
In many natural language applications , there is a need to enrich syntactical parse trees . We present a statistical tree annotator augmenting nodes with additional information . The annotator is generic and can be applied to a variety of applications . We report 3 such applications in this paper : predicting function tags ; predicting null elements ; and predicting whether a tree constituent is projectable in machine translation . Our function tag prediction system outperforms significantly published results.
1 Introduction
Syntactic parsing has made tremendous progress in the past 2 decades ( Magerman , 1994; Ratnaparkhi , 1997; Collins , 1997; Charniak , 2000; Klein and Manning , 2003; Carreras et al , 2008), and accurate syntactic parsing is often assumed when developing other natural language applications . On the other hand , there are plenty of language applications where basic syntactic information is insufficient . For instance , in question answering , it is highly desirable to have the semantic information of a syntactic constituent , e.g ., a nounphrase ( NP ) is a person or an organization ; an adverbial phrase is locative or temporal . As syntactic information has been widely used in machine translation systems ( Yamada and Knight , 2001; Xiong et al , 2010; Shen et al , 2008; Chiang , 2010; Shen et al , 2010), an interesting question is to predict whether or not a syntactic constituent is projectable1 across a language pair.
1A constituent in the source language is projectable if it can be aligned to a contiguous span in the target language.
Such problems can be abstracted as adding additional annotations to an existing tree structure . For example , the English Penn treebank ( Marcus et al , 1993) contains function tags and many carry semantic information . To add semantic information to the basic syntactic trees , a logical step is to predict these function tags after syntactic parsing . For the problem of predicting projectable syntactic constituent , one can use a sentence alignment tool and syntactic trees on source sentences to create training data by annotating a tree node as projectable or not . A generic tree annotator can also open the door of solving other natural language problems so long as the problem can be cast as annotating tree nodes . As one such example , we will present how to predict empty elements for the Chinese language.
Some of the abovementioned problems have been studied before : predicting function tags were studied in ( Blaheta and Charniak , 2000; Blaheta , 2003; Lintean and Rus , 2007a ), and results of predicting and recovering empty elements can be found in ( Dienes et al , 2003; Schmid , 2006; Campbell , 2004). In this work , we will show that these seemingly unrelated problems can be treated uniformly as adding annotations to an existing tree structure , which is the first goal of this work . Second , the proposed generic tree annotator can also be used to solve new problems : we will show how it can be used to predict projectable syntactic constituents.
Third , the uniform treatment not only simplifies the model building process , but also affords us to concentrate on discovering most useful features for a particular application which often leads to improved performances , e.g , we find some features are very effective in predicting function tags and our system Charniak , 2000; Lintean and Rus , 2007a).
The rest of the paper is organized as follows . Section 2 describes our tree annotator , which is a conditional loglinear model . Section 3 describes the features used in our system . Next , three applications of the proposed tree annotator are presented in Section 4: predicting English function tags , predicting Chinese empty elements and predicting Arabic projectable constituents . Section 5 compares our work with some related prior arts.
2 A MaxEnt Tree Annotator Model
The input to the tree annotator is a tree T . While T can be of any type , we concentrate on the syntactic parse tree in this paper . The nonterminal nodes , N = { n : n ? T } of T are associated with an order by which they are visited so that they can be indexed as n1, n2, ? ? ? , n|T |, where | T | is the number of nonterminal nodes in T . As an example , Figure 1 shows a syntactic parse tree with the prefix order ( i.e ., the number at the upright corner of each nonterminal node ), where child nodes are visited recursively from left to right before the parent node is visited . Thus , the NP-SBJ node is visited first , followed by the NP spanning duo action , followed by the PP-CLR node etc.
With a prescribed tree visit order , our tree annotator model predicts a symbol li , where li takes value from a predefined finite set L , for each nonterminal node ni in a sequential fashion:
P ( l1, ? ? ? , l|T || T ) = | T | ? i=1
P ( li|l1, ? ? ? , li?1, T ) (1)
The visit order is important since it determines what are in the conditioning of Eq . (1).
P ( li|l1, ? ? ? , li?1, T ) in this work is a conditional log linear ( or MaxEnt ) model ( Berger et al , 1996):
P ( li|l1, ? ? ? , li?1, T ) = exp ( ? k ? kgk(li?11 , T , li ) )
Z(li?11 , T ) (2) where
Z(li?11 , T ) = ? x?L exp ( ? k ? kgk(li?11 , T , x ) ) Newsnight returns to duo action tonight

is the normalizing factor to ensure that P ( li|l1, ? ? ? , li?1, T ) in Equation (2) is a probability and { gk(li?11 , T , li )} are feature functions.
There are efficient training algorithms to find optimal weights relative to a labeled training data set once the feature functions { gk(li?11 , T , li )} are selected ( Berger et al , 1996; Goodman , 2002; Malouf , 2002). In our work , we use the SCGIS training algorithm ( Goodman , 2002), and the features used in our systems are detailed in the next section.
Once a model is trained , at testing time it is applied to input tree nodes by the same order . Figure 1 highlights the prediction of the function tag for node 3(i.e ., PP-CLR-node in the thickened box ) after 2 shaded nodes ( NP-SBJ node and NP node ) are predicted . Note that by this time the predicted values are available to the system , while unvisited nodes ( nodes in dashed boxes in Figure 1) can not provide such information.
3 Features
The features used in our systems are tabulated in Table 1. Numbers in the first column are the feature indices . The second column contains a brief description of each feature , and the third column contains the feature value when the feature at the same row is applied to the PP-node of Figure 1 for the task of predicting function tags.
Feature 1 through 8 are nonlexical features in that all of them are computed based on the labels or POS tags of neighboring nodes ( e.g ., Feature 4 computes the label or POS tag of the right most child ), or the structure information ( e.g ., Feature 5 computes the number of child nodes).
1231
Feature 9 and 10 are computed from past predicted values . When predicting the function tag for the PP-node in Figure 1, there is no predicted value for its left-sibling and any of its child node . That?s why both feature values are NONE , a special symbol signifying that a node does not carry any function tag . If we were to predict the function tag for the VP-node , the value of Feature 9 would be SBJ , while Feature 10 will be instantiated twice with one value being CLR , another being TMP.

Feature 11 to 19 are lexical features or computed from head nodes . Feature 11 and 12 compute the node-internal boundary words , while Feature 13 and 14 compute the immediate node-external boundary words . Feature 15 to 19 rely on the head information . For instance , Feature 15 computes the head word of the current node , which is to for the PP-node in Figure 1. Feature 16 computes the same for the parent node . Feature 17 tests if the current node is the head of its parent . Feature 18 and 19 compute the label or POS tag and the predicted value of the head child , respectively.
Besides the basic feature presented in Table 1, we also use conjunction features . For instance , applying the conjunction of Feature 1 and 18 to the PP-node in Figure 1 would yield a feature instance that captures the fact that the current node is a PP node and its head child?s POS tag is TO.
4 Applications and Results
A wide variety of language problems can be treated as or cast into a tree annotating problem . In this section , we present three applications of the statistical tree annotator . The first application is to predict function tags of an input syntactic parse tree ; the second one is to predict Chinese empty elements ; and the third one is to predict whether a syntactic constituent of a source sentence is projectable , meaning if the constituent will have a contiguous translation on the target language.
4.1 Predicting Function Tags
In the English Penn Treebank ( Marcus et al , 1993) and more recent OntoNotes data ( Hovy et al , 2006), some tree nodes are assigned a function tag , which is of one of the four types : grammatical , form/function , topicalization and miscellaneous . Table 2 contains a list of function tags used in the English Penn Treebank ( Bies et al , 1995). The ? Grammatical ? row contains function tags marking the grammatical role of a constituent , e.g ., DTV for dative objects , LGS for logical subjects etc . Many tags in the ? Form/function ? row carry semantic information , e.g ., LOC is for locative expressions , and
TMP for temporal expressions.

Table 2: Four types of function tags and their relative frequency 4.1.1 Comparison with Prior Arts In order to have a direct comparison with ( Blaheta and Charniak , 2000; Lintean and Rus , 2007a ), we use the same English Penn Treebank ( Marcus et al , 1993) and partition the data set identically : Section and Section 23 as the test set . We use all features in Table 1 and build four models , each of which predicting one type of function tags . The results are tabulated in Table 3.
As can be seen , our system performs much better than both ( Blaheta and Charniak , 2000) and ( Lintean and Rus , 2007a ). For two major categories , namely grammatical and form/function which account for 96.84% non-null function tags in the test set , our system achieves a relative error reduction of 77.1% ( from ( Blaheta and Charniak , 2000)?s 1.09% to 0.25%) and 46.9%(from ( Blaheta and Charniak , 2000)?s 2.90% to 1.54%) , respectively . The performance improvements result from a clean learning framework and some new features we introduced : e.g ., the node-external features , i.e ., Feature 13 and 14 in Table 1, can capture long-range statistical dependencies in the conditional model (2) and are proved very useful ( cf . Section 4.1.2). As far as we can tell , they are not used in previous work.

Table 3: Function tag prediction accuracies on gold parse trees : breakdown by types of function tags . The 2nd column is due to ( Blaheta and Charniak , 2000) and 3rd column due to ( Lintean and Rus , 2007a ). Our results on the 4th column compare favorably with theirs.
4.1.2 Relative Contributions of Features Since the English WSJ data set contains newswire text , the most recent OntoNotes ( Hovy et al , 2006) contains text from a more diversified genres such as broadcast news and broadcast conversation , we decide to test our system on this data set as well.
WSJ Section 24 is used for development and Section 23 for test , and the rest is used as the training data . Note that some WSJ files were not included in the OntoNotes release and Section 23 in OntoNotes contains only 1640 sentences . The OntoNotes data statistics is tabulated in Table 4. Less than 2% of nodes with nonempty function tags were assigned multiple function tags . To simplify the system building , we take the first tag in training and testing and report the aggregated accuracy only in this section.

We use this data set to test relative contributions of different feature groups by incrementally adding features into the system , and the results are reported in Table 5. The dummy baseline is predicting the most likely prior ? the empty function tag , which indicates that there are 78.21% of nodes without a function tag . The next line reflects the performance of a system with nonlexical features only ( Feature 1 to 8 in Table 1), and the result is fairly poor with an accuracy 91.51%. The past predictions ( Feature 8 and 9) helps a bit by improving the accuracy to 92.04%. Node internal lexical features ( Feature 11 and 12) are extremely useful : it added more than 3 points to the accuracy . So does the node external lexical features ( Feature 13 and 14) which added an additional 1.52 points . Features computed from head words ( Feature 15 to 19) carry information complementary to the lexical features and it helps quite a bit by improving the accuracy by 0.64%. When all features are used , the system reached an accuracy of 97.34%.
From these results , we can conclude that , unlike syntactic parsing ( Bikel , 2004), lexical information is extremely important for predicting and recovering function tags . This is not surprising since many function tags carry semantic information , and more often than not , the ambiguity can only be resolved by lexical information . E.g ., whether a PP is locative or temporal PP is heavily influenced by the lexical choice of the NP argument.
4.2 Predicting Chinese Empty Elements
As is well known , Chinese is a prodrop language.
This and its lack of subordinate conjunction complementizers lead to the ubiquitous use of empty elements in the Chinese treebank ( Xue et al , 2005).
Predicting or recovering these empty elements is therefore important for the Chinese language pro-prior ( guess NONE ) 78.21%
Nonlexical labels only 91.52% + past prediction 92.04% + node-internal lexical 95.17% + node-external lexical 96.70% + head word 97.34% Table 5: Effects of feature sets : the second row contains the baseline result when always predicting NONE ; Row 3 through 8 contain results by incrementally adding feature sets.
cessing . Recently , Chung and Gildea (2010) has found it useful to recover empty elements in machine translation.
Since empty elements do not have any surface string representation , we tackle the problem by attaching a pseudo function tag to an empty element?s lowest nonempty parent and then removing the subtree spanning it . Figure 2 contains an example tree before and after removing the empty element * pro * and annotating the nonempty parent with a pseudo function tag NoneL . The transformation procedure is summarized in Algorithm 1.
In particular , line 2 of Algorithm 1 find the lowest parent of an empty element that spans at least one non-trace word . In the example in Figure 2, it would find the top IP-node . Since * pro * is the leftmost child , line 4 of Algorithm 1 adds the pseudo function tag NoneL to the top IP-node . Line 9 then removes its NP child node and all lower children ( i.e ., shaded subtree in Figure 2(1)), resulting in the tree in Figure 2(2).
Line 4 to 8 of Algorithm 1 indicate that there are 3 types of pseudo function tags : NoneL , NoneM , and NoneR , encoding a trace found in the left , middle or right position of its lowest nonempty parent.
It?s trivial to recover a trace?s position in a sentence from NoneL , and NoneR , but it may be ambiguous for NoneM . The problem could be solved either using heuristics to determine the position of a middle empty element , or encoding the positional information in the pseudo function tag . Since here we just want to show that predicting empty elements can be cast as a tree annotation problem , we leave this option to future research.
With this transform , the problem of predicting a trace is cast into predicting the corresponding

4.2.1 Results
We use Chinese Treebank v6.0 ( Xue et al , 2005) and the broadcast conversation data from CTB v7.0 2. The data set is partitioned into training , development and blind test as shown in Table 6. The partition is created so that different genres are well represented in different subsets . The training , development and test set have 32925, 3297 and 3033 sentences , respectively.

Out of 1,100,506 nonterminal nodes in the training data , 80,212 of them contain pseudo function tags . There are 94 nodes containing 2 pseudo function tags . The vast majority of pseudo tags ? more then 99.7% ? are attached to either IP , CP , or VP : 50971, 20113, 8900, respectively.
We used all features in Table 1 and achieved an accuracy of 99.70% on the development data , and 99.71% on the test data on gold trees.
To understand why the accuracies are so high , we look into the 5 most frequent labels carrying pseudo tags in the development set , and tabulate their performance in Table 7. The 2nd column contains the number of nodes in the reference ; the 3rd column the number of nodes of system output ; the 4th column the number of nodes with correct prediction ; and the 5th column Fmeasure for each label.
From Table 7, it is clear that CP-NoneL and IP-NoneL are easy to predict . This is not surprising , given that the Chinese language lacks of 2Many files are missing in LDC?s early 2010 release of CTB 7.0, but broadcast conversation portion is new and is used in our system.

Table 7: 5 most frequent labels carrying pseudo tags and their performances complementizers for subordinate clauses . In other words , leftmost empty elements under CP are almost unambiguous : if a CP node has an immediate IP child , it almost always has a leftmost empty element ; similarly , if an IP node has a VP node as the leftmost child ( i.e ., without a subject ), it almost always should have a left empty element ( e.g ., marking the dropped pro ). Another way to interpret these results is as follows : when developing the Chinese treebank , there is really no point to annotate leftmost traces for CP and IP when tree structures are available.
On the other hand , predicting the leftmost empty elements for VP is a lot harder : the Fmeasure is only 86.8% for VP-NoneL . Predicting the rightmost empty elements under VP and middle empty elements under IP is somewhat easier : VP-NoneR and IP-NoneM?s Fmeasures are 92.3% and 93.6%, respectively.
4.3 Predicting Projectable Constituents
The third application is predicting projectable constituents for machine translation . State-of-the-art machine translation systems ( Yamada and Knight , 2001; Xiong et al , 2010; Shen et al , 2008; Chiang , 2010; Shen et al , 2010) rely heavily on syntactic analysis . Projectable structures are important in that it is assumed in CFG-style translation rules that a source span can be translated contiguously . Clearly , not all source constituents can be translated this way , but if we can predict whether a nonterminal source node is projectable , we can avoid translation errors by bypassing or discouraging the derivation paths relying on non-projectable constituents , or using phrasebased approaches for non-projectable constituents.
We start from LDC?s bilingual Arabic-English treebank with source human parse trees and alignments , and mark source constituents as either pro-b # sbb " " l # Alms&wl the Iraqi official ? s sudden obligations ".

jectable or non-projectable . The binary annotations can again be treated as pseudo function tags and the proposed tree annotator can be readily applied to this problem.
As an example , the top half of Figure 3 contains an Arabic sentence with its parse tree ; the bottom is its English translation with the human word-alignment . There are three non-projectable constituents marked with ?#?: the top PP # spanning the whole sentence except the final stop , and NP#1 and NP#2. The PP # node is not projectable due to an inserted stop from outside ; NP#1 is not projectable because it is involved in a 2-to-2 alignment with the token b # outside NP#1; NP#2 is aligned to a span the Iraqi official ? s sudden obligations ., in which Iraqi official breaks the contiguity of the translation . It is clear that a CFG-like grammar will not be able to generate the translation for NP#2.
The LDC?s Arabic-English bilingual treebank does not mark if a source node is projectable or not , but the information can be computed from word alignment . In our experiments , we processed 16,125 sentence pairs with human source trees for training , and 1,151 sentence pairs for testing . The statistics of the training and test data can be found in Table 8, where the number of sentences , the number of nonterminal nodes and the number of non-projectable nodes are listed in Column 2 through 4, respectively.

Table 8: Statistics of the data for predicting projectable constituents We get a 94.6% accuracy for predicting projectable constituents on the gold trees , and an 84.7% Fmeasure on the machine-generated parse trees.
This component has been integrated into our machine translation system ( Zhao et al , 2011).
5 Related Work
Blaheta and Charniak (2000) used a feature tree model to predict function tags . The work was later extended to use the voted perceptron ( Blaheta , 2003). There are considerable overlap in terms of features used in ( Blaheta and Charniak , 2000; Blaheta , 2003) and our system : for example , the label of current node , parent node and sibling nodes . However , there are some features that are unique in our work , e.g ., lexical features at a constituent boundaries ( node-internal and node-external words ). Table 2 of ( Blaheta and Charniak , 2000) contains the ac-in Table 3 compare favorably with those in ( Blaheta and Charniak , 2000). Lintean and Rus (2007a ; Lintean and Rus (2007b ) also studied the function tagging problem and applied naive Bayes and decision tree to it . Their accuracy results are worse than ( Blaheta and Charniak , 2000). Neither ( Blaheta and Charniak , 2000) nor ( Lintean and Rus , 2007a ; Lintean and Rus , 2007b ) reported the relative usefulness of different features , while we found that the lexical features are extremely useful.
Campbell (2004) and Schmid (2006) studied the problem of predicting and recovering empty categories , but they used very different approaches : in ( Campbell , 2004), a rule-based approach is used while ( Schmid , 2006) used a nonlexical PCFG similar to ( Klein and Manning , 2003). Chung and Gildea (2010) studied the effects of empty categories on machine translation and they found that even with noisy machine predictions , empty categories still helped machine translation . In this paper , we showed that empty categories can be encoded as pseudo function tags and thus predicting and recovering empty categories can be cast as a tree annotating problem . Our results also shed light on some empty categories can almost be determined unambiguously , given a gold tree structure , which suggests that these empty elements do not need to be annotated.
Gabbard et al (2006) modified Collins ? parser to output function tags . Since their results for predicting function tags are on system parses , they are not comparable with ours . ( Gabbard et al , 2006) also contains a second stage employing multiple classifiers to recover empty categories and resolve coindexations between an empty element and its antecedent.
As for predicting projectable constituent , it is related to the work described in ( Xiong et al , 2010), where they were predicting translation boundaries.
A major difference is that ( Xiong et al , 2010) defines projectable spans on a left-branching derivation tree solely for their phrase decoder and models , while translation boundaries in our work are defined from source parse trees . Our work uses more resources , but the prediction accuracy is higher ( modulated on a different test data ): we get a Fmeasure 84.7%, in contrast with ( Xiong et al , 2010)?s 71%.
6 Conclusions and Future Work
We proposed a generic statistical tree annotator in the paper . We have shown that a variety of natural language problems can be tackled with the proposed tree annotator , from predicting function tags , predicting empty categories , to predicting projectable syntactic constituents for machine translation . Our results of predicting function tags compare favorably with published results on the same data set , possibly due to new features employed in the system.
We showed that empty categories can be represented as pseudo function tags , and thus predicting empty categories can be solved with the proposed tree annotator . The same technique can be used to predict projectable syntactic constituents for machine translation.
There are several directions to expand the work described in this paper . First , the results for predicting function tags and Chinese empty elements were obtained on human-annotated trees and it would be interesting to do it on parse trees generated by system . Second , predicting projectable constituents is for improving machine translation and we are integrating the component into a syntaxbased machine translation system.
