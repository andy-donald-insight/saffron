Abstract
Speakers convey much of the information hearers use to interpret discourse by varying prosodic feature such as PHRASING  , PITCHACCENT placement , TUNE , and PITCHP . ANGE . The ability to emulate such variation is crucial to effective  ( synthetic ) speech generation . While text-to-speech synthesis must rely primarily upon structural information to determine appropriate intonational features  , speech synthesized from an abstract representation f the message to be conveyed may employ much richer sources  . 
The implementation f an intonation assignment component for Direction Assistance  , a program which generates spoken directions , provides a first approximation of how recent models of discourse structure can be used to control intonational variation in ways that build upon recent research in intonational meaning  . The implementation further suggests ways in which these discourse models might he augmented to permit the assignment of appropriate intonational features  . 

DIRECTIONASSISTANCE ! was written to provide spoken directions for driving between any two points in the Boston  areal7\] over the telephone . Callers specify their origin and destination via toucht one input  . The program finds arout e and synthesizes a spoken description of that route  . Earlier versions of Direction Assistancexhibited notable deficiencies in prosody when a simple text-to-speech system was used to produce such  descriptions\[6\]  , because prosody depends in part on discourse -level phenomena such as topic structure and information status which are not generally inferrable from text  , and thus * The into n ~ tion , d component described here was completed at AT&T Bell Laboratories in the summcT of  1987  .

cannot be correctly produced by the text to speech system  . 
To alleviate some of these problems , we modified Direction Assistance to make both attentional and intentional information about the route description available for the assignment of intonational features  . With this information , we generate spoken directions using the Bell Labo ~ ratories Text-to-Speech  System\[21\] in which pitch range , accent placement , phrasing , and tune can be varied to communicate attentional and intentional structure  . The implementation f this intonation assignment component provides a first approximation of how recent models of discourse structure can be used to control intonational variation in ways that build upon recent research in intonational meaning  . Additionally , it suggests ways in which these discourse models must be enhanced in order to per-mlt the assignment of appropriate intonational features  . 
In this paper , we first discuss some previous attempts to synthesize speech from representations other than simple text  . We next discuss the work on discourse structure , on English phonology , and on intonational meaning which we assume for this study  . We then give a brief overview of Direction Assistance  . Next we describe how Direction Assistance represents discourse structures and uses them to generate appropriate prosody  . 
Previous Studies
Only a few voice interactive systems have attempted to exploit intonation in the interaction  . The Telephone Enquiry Service ( TES )   \[19\] was designed as a framework for application such as database inquiries  , games , and calculator functions . Application programmers specified text by phonetic symbols and intonation by a code which extended Halliday's\[ll\]intonation scheme  . While TES gave programmers a high-level means of varying prosody  , it made no attemp to derive prosody automatically from an abstract representation  . 

Young and Fallside's\[20\] Speech Synthesis from Concept ( SSC ) system first demonstrated the gains to be had by providing more than simple text as input to a speech synthesizer  . SSC passed a network representation fsyntactic structure to the synthesizer  . Syntactic information could thus inform accenting and phrasing decisions  . However , structural information alone is insufficient to determine intonational  features\[10\]  , and SSC does not use semantic or pragmatic /discourse information  . 
Discourse and Intonation
The theoretical foundations of the current work are three : Grosz and Sidner's theory of discourse structure  , Pierre-humbert's theory of English intonation , and Hirschberg and Pierrehumbert's studies of intonation and discourse  . 
ing a discourse is reconstructing the DP , DSPs and relations among them . 
Attentional structure in this model is an abstraction of ' focus of attention '  , in which the set of salient entities changes as the discourse unfolds  .   2 A given discourse's attentional structure is represented as a stack of FOCUS SPACES  , which contain representations of entities referenced in a given DS  , such as ' flywhe el ' or ' allen-head screws ' , as well as the DS's DSP . The accessibility of an entity mas , for pronominal reference m depends upon the depth of its containing focus space  . Deeper spaces are less accessible . Entities may be made in accessible if their focus space is popped from the stack  . 
Intonational Features and their Interpre- tation 
Modeling Discourse Structure
Grosz and Sidner\[9\] propose that discourse be understood in terms of the purposes that underly it  ( INTENTIONAL STRUCTURE ) and the entities and attributes which are salient during it  ( ATTENTIONAL STRUCTURE )  . Ill this account , discourses are analyzed as hierarchies of segments  , each of which has an underlying Discourse Segment Purpose  ( DSP ) intended by the speaker . All DSPs contribute to the overall Discourse Purpose  ( DP ) of the discourse . For example , a discourse might have as its DP something like ' intend that Hearer put together an air compressor  '  , while individual segments might have as contributing DSP's'intend that Hearer remove the fly-wheel'or'intend that Hearer attach the conduito the motor '  . Such DSP's may in turn be r . e presented as hierarchies of intentions , such as ' intend that a hearer loosent heallen -head screws '  , and ' intend that Hearer locate the wheel-puller  '  . DSPsa and b may be related to one another in two ways : a may DOMINATE bif the DSP of a is partially fulfilled by the DSP of b  ( equivalently , bCONTRIBUTESTOa ) . So , ' intend that Hearer remove the fly wheel ' dominates ' intend that He arer loosen the all en -head screws '  , and the latter contributes to the former . Segment a SATISF ACTION-PRECEDES bif the DSP of a must be achieved in order for the DSP of b to be successful  . ' Intend that Hearer locate the wheel-puller ' satisfaction-precedes ' intend that Hearer use the wheel-puller '  , and so on . Such intentional structure has been studied most extensively in task-oriented domains  , such as instruction in assembling machinery , where speaker intentions appear to follow the structure of the task to some extent  . In Grosz and Sidner's model , part of understand-This model of discourse is employed for expository purposes by Hirschberg and  Pierrehumbert\[12\] in their work on the relationship between intonational and discourse features  . In Pierrehumbert's theory of English phonolog~v\[16\]  , intonational contours are represented as sequences of high  ( H ) and low ( L ) tones ( local maxima and minima ) in the FUNDAMENTALFREQUENCY ( f0 )  . 
Pitch accents fall on the stressed syllables of some lexical items  , and may be simple HorLtones or complext ones . 
The four bitonal accents in English ( H*--L , H-I-L* , L*-I-H , L-I-H * ) differ in the order of tones and in which tone is aligned with the stressed syllable of the accented item -- the asterisk indicates alignment with stress  . Pitch accents mark items as intonationally prominent and convey the relative ' newness ' or ' salience ' of items in the discourse  . For example , in(la ) , right is accented ( as ' new ') , while in ( lb ) it is deaccented ( as ' old ') . 
(I)a . Takearight , onto Concord Avenue.
b . Take another right , onto Magazine Street.
Different pitch accents convey different meanings : For example  , a L-t-H * on right in ( la ) may convey ' contrastive-ness ' , as after the query So , you take a left onto Concord ? . 
A simple H * is more likely when the direction of the turn has not been questioned  . AL*~H , however , can convey incredulity or uncertainty about the direction  . 
INTERMEDIATEPHRASES are composed of one or more pitch accents  , plus an additional PHRASEACCENT ( HorL ) , which controls the pitch from the last pitch accent to ~ See  \[1\] and \[3\] for earlier AI work on global and local focus . 
188 the end of the phrase . INTONATIONAL PHRASES consist of one or more intermediate phrases  , plus a BOUNDARY TONE , also Hor L , which falls at the edge of the phrase ; we indicate boundary tones with an '%' , as H % . Phrase boundaries are marked by lengthened final syllables and  ( perhaps ) a pause -- as well as by tones . Variations in phrasing may convey structural relationships among elements of a phrase  . For example ,   ( 2 ) uttered as two phrases favors a nonrestrictive r a ding in which the first right happens to be onto Central Park  . 
(2) Take the first right\[,\] onto CentralPark.
Uttered as a single phrase , (2) favors the restrictive reading , instructing the driver to find the first right which goes on to Central Park  . 
TUNES , or intonational contours , have as their domain the intonational phrase . While the meaning of tunes appears to be composition alw from the meanings of their pitch accents  , phrase accents , and boundary tones\[15\] , certain broad generalizations may be made about particular tunes in English  . Phrases ending in LH % appear to convey some sense that the phrase is to be completed by another phrase  . Phrases ending in LL % appear more ' declarative ' than'interrogative'phrases ending in HH %  . Phrases composed of sequences of H*-I-L accents are often used didactically  . 
The PITCHRANGE of a phrase is ( roughly ) the distance between the maximum f0 value in the phrase ( modulo segmental effects and FINALLO WERING effects  ) and the speaker's BASELINE , defined for each speaker as the lowest point reached in normal speech over all utterances  . 
Variation in pitch range can communicate he topic structure of a  discourse\[12  ,  18\] ; increasing the pitch range of a phrase over prior phrases can convey the introduction of a new topic  , and decreasing the pitch range over a prior phrase can convey the continuation of a subtopic  . After any bitonal pitch accent pitch range is compressed  . This compression , called catathesls , or down step , extends to the nearest phrase boundary . Another process , called FI-NALL OWEP ~ NG , involves a compression of the pitch range during the last half second or so of a ' declarative ' utterances  . The amount of final lowering present for utterance appears to correlate with the amount of ' finality ' to be conveyed by the utterance  . That is , utterances that end topics appear to exhibit more final lowering  , while utterances within a topic segment may have little or none  . 
Intonation in Direction-Giving To identify potential genre-specific ntonational characteristics of direction-giving  , we performed in formal production studies , with speakers reading sample texts of directions similar to those generated by Direction As -sistance  . From acoustic analysis of this data , we noted first that speakers tended to use H*+L accents quite frequently  , in utterances like that whose pitch track appears in Figure  1  . The use of such contours has been associated in the literature with ' didactic ' or ' pedantic ' contexts  . Hence , the propensity for using this contour in giving direction seems not inappropriate to emulate  . 
We also noted tendencies for subjects to vary pitch range in ways similar to proposals mentioned above that is  , to indicate large topic shifts by increasing pitch range and to use smaller pit chranges where utterances appeared to ' continue ' a previous topic  . And we noted variation in pausal duration which was consistent with the notion that speakers produce longer pauses at major topic boundaries than before an utterance that continues a topic  . However , these informal studies were simply intended to produce guidelines  . 
In the intonation assignment component we added to Direction Assistance  , pitch accent placement , phrasing , tune , and pitch range and final lowering are varied as noted above to convey information status  , structural information , relationships among utterances , and topic structure . We will now describe how Direction Assistance works in general  , and , in particular , how it uses this component in generating spoken directions  . 
Direction Assistance
Direction Assistance has four major components . The LocationFinder queries the user to obtain the origin and destination of the route  . The RouteFinder then finds a ' best'route , in terms of drivability and describabil-ity . Once a route is determined , the Describer generates a text describing the route  , which the Narrator reads to the user . In the work reported here , we modified the Describer to generate an abstract representation of the route description and replaced the Narrator with a new component  , he Talker , which computes prosodic values from these structures and passes text augmented with commands controlling prosodic variation to the speech synthesizer  .

Act types include start and stop , for the beginning and ending of the tour , and various kinds of turns . A rich classification of turns is required in order to generate natural text  .

For each act type , there is a corresponding descriptive schema to produce text describing that act  . Text generation also involves selecting an appropriate cue for the act  . There are four types of cues : Action cues signal when to perform an act  , such as " When your each the end of the road , dox ' . Confirmatory cues are indicators that one is successfully following the route  , such as " You'll cross x " or " You ' llseey ' . Warning cuescaution the driver about possible mistakes  . Failure cues to describe the consequences of mistakes  ( e . g . " If you seex , you have gone too far ' ) have not yet been implemented . 
In general , there will be several different items potentially useful as action or confirmatory cues  . The Describer selects the one which is most easily recognized  ( e . g . a bridge crossing ) sad which is close to the act for which it is a cue  . 
Descriptive schemas are internally organized into syntactic constituents  . Some constituents are constant , and others , e . g . street names and direction of turns , axe slots to be filled by the Describer from the tour  . Constituents axe further grouped into one or more  ( potential ) intonational phrases . Each phrase will have a pitch range , a preceding pause duration , a phrase accent , and a boundary tone assigned by the Talker . Phrases that end utterances will also have a final lowering percentage  . Where schemas include more than one intonational phrase  , relationships among these phrases are documented in the schema template so that they may be preserved when intonational features are assigned  . 
Intentional structure is also represented at the level of the intonational phrase  . Unlike in Grosz and Sidner's model , a single phrase may represent a discourse segment  . This departure stems from our belief that , following\[12 ,  15\] , certain intonational contours can communicate relationships among DSP's  .   3 Certain relationships 3It is possible that the intermed la~e phrase my prove an even betty " u~t for discourse segmentation  . 
190 among DSP's are specified within schemas ; others are determined from the general task structure indicated by the domain and the particular task structure indicated by the current path  . 
Constituents may be annotated with semantic information to be used in determining information status  . Semantic annotations include the type of the object and a pointer  ( to the internal representation for the object designated  )  . For each type of object , there is a predicate which can test two objects of that type for co-designation  . 
For example , for purposes of reference or accenting we may want to treat's tree t ' and ' avenue ' as similar  . 
Each DS has associated with it a focus space . Following\[2\] , a focus space consists of a set of FORWARD -LOOKING CENTERS  , potentially salient discours entities and modifiers  . Focus spaces are pushed and popped from the FOCUS STACK as the description is generated  , according to the relationships among their associated DS's  . 
As an example , the generator for the rotary act appears in figure  2  . This schema generates two sentences , second of which is a conjunction . One slot in this schema is taken by an NP constituent for the rotary  . 
The make-np-constituent routine handles agreement between the article and the noun  . A second slot is filled with an expression giving the approximate angular distance traveled around the rotary  . The actual value depends upon the specifics of the act  . A third slot in this schema is filled by the name of the street reached after taking the rotary  . The choice of referring expression for the street name depends upon the type of street  . No cues are generated here , on the grounds that arotary is unmistakable . 
Assigning Intonational Features
The TA licer employes variation in pitch range , pausal duration , and final lowering ratio to reflec the topic structure of the description  , or , the relationship among DS's as reflected in the relationship among DSP's  . Following the proposals of \[12\] , we implement this variation by assigned each DS an embeddedness level  , which is just the depth of the DS within the discourse tree  . Pitch range decreases with embeddedness . In Grosz and Sidner's terms , for example , for DS1 and DS2 , with DSPz dominating DSP2 , we assign DS1 a larger pitch range than DS2 . Similarly , if DSP2 dominates DSP3 , DSs will have a still smaller pitch range than DS2  . Sibling DS's will thus share a common pitch range  . Pitch variation is perceived logarithmically , sopit chrange decreases as a constant fraction ( . 9 ) at each ( defundisc-seg-rotary ( act )   ( list ( make-sentence " You ' ll " " come " " to " ( make-np-constil ; uenl ;  '  ( " rotary " ) : article : indefinite ) )  ( make-conjunction-sentence ( make-sentence " Go " ( rotary-angle-amount ( get-in foact ' rotary-angle )   ) " eay .   .   .   . around " ( make-anaphoranil " it " )   )   ( make-sentence " l ; nrn " " onto " ( make-street-constituent ( move-to-segment act ) act ) )  )   ) ) Figure 2: Generator for Rotary Act Type level , but never falls below a minimum value above the baseline  . Also following \[12\] , we vary final lowering to indicate the level of embeddedness of the segment completed by the current utterance  . We largely suspend final lowering for the current utterance when it is followed by an utterance with greater embedding  , to produce a sense of topic continuity . Where the subsequent uterance has a lesser degree of embedding than the current utterance  , we increase final lowering proportionally . So , for example , if the current utterance were followed by an utterance with embedding level  0   ( i . e . , no embedding , indicating a major topic shift ) , we would give the current utterance maximal final lowering  ( here ,   . 87) . Pansal duration is greatest ( here , 800 msec ) between segments at the least embedded level , and decreases by 200 msec for each level of embedding , to a minimum of 100 msec between phrases . Of course , the actual values assigned in the current application are somewhat arbitrary  . In assigning final lowering , aspit chrange and intervening pausal duration , it is the relative differences that are important . 
Accent placement is determined according to relative salience and ' newness ' of the mentioned item  . \[12 ,  14 , 5\] ( We employ Prince's\[17\] Givens , or given-salient notion here to distinguish ' given ' from ' new ' information  . However , it would be possible to extend this to include hierarchically related items evoked in a discourse as also given  , or ' Chafe-given'\[17\] , were such possibilities present in our domain . ) Certain object types and modifier types in the domain have been declared to be potentially salient  . 
When such an item is to be mentioned in the path description  , it is first sought in the current focus space and its ancestors  . In general , if it is found , it is deaccented ; otherwise it receives a pitch accent . If the object is not a is deaccented , otherwise it is taken to be a miscellaneous content word and receives an accent by default  . In some cases , we found that--contra current theories of focus -- items should remain deaccentable even when the focus spaces containing them have been popped from the focus stack  . In particular , items in the current focus space's preceding sibling appear to retain their ' givenness '  . Re-analysis to place both occurrences in the same segment or to ensure that the first is in a parent segment seemed to lack independent justification  . So , we decided to allow items to remain ' given ' across sibling segment boundaries  , and extended our deaccenting possibilities accordingly  . 
We vary phrasing primarily to convey structural information  . Structural distinction such as those presented by example  ( 2 ) are accomplished in this way . 
Intentional structure is conveyed by varying intonational contour as well as pitch range  , final lowering , and pausal duration . A phrase which required ' completion ' by another phrase is assigned a low phrase accent and a high boundary tone  ( this combination is commonly known as CONTINUATION RISE  )  . \[15\]For example , since we generate VP conjunctions primarily to indicate temporal or causal relationship  ( e . g Stayon Main Street for about ninetyy ards , and cross the Longfellow Bridge . ) , we use continuation rise in such cases on the first phrase  . 
The sample text in Figure 3 i a generated by the system . Note that commands to the speech synthesizer have been simplified for readability as follows : ' T ' indicates the top line of the current intonational phrase  ; ' F ' indicates the amount of final lowering ; ' D ' corresponds to the duration of pause between phrases  ; ' N*' indicates a pitch accent of type N ; other words are not accented . Phrase accents are represented by simple H or L , and boundary tones are indicated by % . The topic structure of the text is indicated by indentation  . 
Note that pitch range , final lowering , and pauses between phrases are manipulated to enforce the desired topic structure of the text  . Pitchrange is decreased to re-fleet the beginning of a subtopic  ; phrases that continue a topic retain the pitch range of the preceding phrase  . Final lowering is increased to mark the end of topics  ; for example , the large amount of final lowering produced on the last phrase conveys the end of the discourse  , while lesser amounts of lowering within the text enhance the sense of connection between its parts  . Pauses between clauses are also manipulated so that lesser pauses separate clauses which are to be interpreted as more closely related to one another  . For example , the segment beginning with You'll come to a rotary  . . , is separated from the previous dis-T\[170\] H*+LIf your H*+L caris on the H*+L same H*+Ls ide of the H*+L street as H*+L  7 H*+LB roadwayStreetLH\Y , D\[600\]

We have described how structural , semantic , and discourse information can be represented to permit the principled assignment of pitch range  , accent placement and type , phrasing , and pause in order to generate spoken directions with appropriate intonational features  . We have tested these ideas by modifying the text generation component of Direction Assistance to produce an abstract representation f the information to be conveyed  . 
This ' message-to-speech ' approach to speech synthesis has clear advantages over simple text -to-speech synthesis  , since the generator ' knows ' the meanings to be conveyed  . This application , while oversimplifying the relationship between discourse information and intonational features to some extent  , nonetheless demonstrates that it should be possible to assign more appropriate prosodic the meaning of a text  . Further research in intonational meaning and in the relationship of that meaning to aspects of discourse structure should facilitate progress toward this goal  .
