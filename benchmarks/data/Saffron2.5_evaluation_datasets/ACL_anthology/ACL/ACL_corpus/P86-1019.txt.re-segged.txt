1. Introduction
This paper describes our current research on the properties of derivation alf fixation in English  . Our research arises from a more general research project  , the Lexical Systems project at the IBM Thomas J . Watson Research laboratories , the goal for which is to build a variety of computerized dictionary systems for use both by people and by computer programs  . An important subgoal is to build reliable and robust word recognition mechanisms for these dictionaries  . One of the more important issues in word recognition for all morphologically complex languages involves mechanisms for dealing with affixes  . 
Two complementary motivations underlie our research on derivational morphology  . On the one hand , our goal is to discover linguistically significant generalizations and principles governing the attachment of affixes to English words to form other words  . If we can find such generalizations , then we can use them to build our ~ m-proved word recognizer  . We will be better able to correctly recognize and analyse wellformed words and  , on the other hand , to reject ill-formed words . On the other hand , we want to use our existing word-recognition ad analysis programs as tools for gathering further information about English affixation  . This circular process allows us to test and refine our emerging word recognition logic while at the same time providing a large amount of data for linguistic analysis  . 
It is important onote that , while doing derivational morphology is not the only way to deal with complex words in a computerized dictionary  , it offers certain advantages . It allows systems to deal with coinages , a possibility which is not open to most systems . Systems which do no morphology and even those which handle primarily inflectional affixation  ( such as Winograd ( 1971 ) and Koskenniemi ( 1983 ) ) are limited by the fixed size of their lists of stored words  . Koskenniemi claims that his two-level morphology framework can handle derivation alf fixation  , although is examples are all of inflectional processes  . It is not clear how that framework accounts for the variety of phenomena that we observe in English derivational morphology  . 
Morphological analysis also provides an additional source of lexical information about words  , since a word's properties can often be predicted from its structure  . In this respect , our dictionaries are distinguished from those of Allen  ( 1976 ) where complex words are merely analysed as concatenations of word-parts and Cercone  ( 1974 ) where word structure is not exploited , even though derivation alf fixes are analysed . 
Our morphological nalysi system was conceived within the linguistic framework of word-based morphology  , as described in Aron off (1976) . In our dictionaries , we store a large number of words , together with associated idiosyncratic information  . The retrieval mechanism contains a grammar of derivational  ( and inflectional ) affixation which is used to analyse input strings in terms of the stored words  . The mechanism handles both prefixes and suffixes . The framework and mechanism are described in Byrd  ( 1983a )  . Crucially , in our system , the attachment of an affix to a base word is conditioned on the properties of the base word  . The purpose of our research is to determine the precise nature of those conditions  . These conditions may refer to syntactic , semantic , etymological , morphological or phonological properties . 
( See Byrd (1983b)).
Our research is of interest to two related audiences : both computational linguists and theoretical linguists  . Computational linguists will find here a powerful set of pro-Furthermore  , they should welcome the improvements othose programs ' capabilities offered by our linguistic re-suits  . Theoretical linguists , on the other hand , will find a novel set of tools and data sources for morphological research  . The generalizations that result from our analyses should be welcome additions to linguistic theory  . 
2. Approach and Tools
Our approach to computer-aided morphological research is to analyse a large number of English words in terms of a somewhat smaller list of monomorphemic base words  . For each morphologically complex word on the originalist which can be analyse down to one of our bases  , we obtain a structure which shows the affixes and marks the parts-of-speech of the components  . 
Thus , for beautification , we obtain the structure <<< beauty > N+ify > V+ ion > N  . 
In this structure , the noun beauty is the ultimate base and + if y and + ion are the affixes  . 
After analysis , we obtain , for each base , a list of all words derived from it , together with their morphological structures . We then study these lists and the patterns of affixation they exemplify  , seeking generalizations . 
Section 3 will give an expande description of the approach together with a detailed account of one of the studies  . 
We have two classes of tools : word lists and computer programs  . There are basically four word lists . 
1 . The Kucera and Francis ( K&F ) word list , from Kucera and Francis (1967) , contains 50 , 0 00 words listed in order of frequency of occurrence . 
2 . The BASE WORDLIST consists of approximately 3 , 000 monomorphemic words . It was drawn from the top of the K&F list by the GETBASES procedure described below  . 
3 . The UDICT word list consists of about 63 , 000 words , drawn mainly from Merriam (1963) . The UDICT program , described below , uses this list in conjunction with our word grammar to produce morphological analyses of input words  . The UDICT word list is a superset of the base word list  ; for each word , it contains the major category as well as other grammatical information  . 
4 . The " complete " word list consists of approximately one quarter million words drawn from an international-sized dictionary  . Each entry on this list is a single orthographic word  , with no additional information . These are the words which are morphologically analyse down to the bases on our base list  . 
5 . We have prepared reverse spelling word lists based on each of the other lists  . A particularly useful tool has been a group of reverse lists derived from Merriam  ( 1963 ) and separated by major category . 
These lists provide ready access to sets of words having the same suffix  . 
Our computer programs include the following.
1 . UDICT . This is a general purpose dictionary access system intended for use by computer programs  . 
(The UDICT program was originally developed for the EPISTLE text-critiquing system  , as described in Heidorn , et al (1982) . ) It contains , among other things , the morphological analysis logic and the word grammar that we use to produce the word structures previously described  . 
2 . GET BASES . This program produces a list of monomorphemic words from the original K&F frequency lists  . Basically , it operates by invoking UDICT for each word . The output consists of words which are morphologically simple  , and the bases of morphologically complex words . ( Among other things , this allows us to handle the fact that the original K&F lists are not lemmatised  . ) The resulting list , with duplicates removed , is our " baselist " . 
3 . ANALYSE . ANALYSE takes each entry from the complete word list  . It invokes the UDICT program to give a morphological nalysis for that word  . Any word whose ultimate base is in the base list is considered a derived word  . For each word from the base list , the final result is a list of pairs consisting of \[ derived-word  , structure \] The data produced by ANALYSE is further processed by the next four programs  . 
4 . ANALYSES . This program allows us to inspec the set of \[ derived-word  , structure \] pairs associated with any word in the baselist  . For example , its output for the word beauty is shown in Figure  1  . In the beautification <<<*> N+ify>V+i on > N beautifier <<<*> N+if y > V#er>N beautiful < <*> N#ful > A beautifully <<<*> N#ful>A-ly > D beautifulness <<<*> N#ful>A#ness > N beautify < <*> N+if y > Vun be autified < un #<<*> N+if y > V + ed > A > A unbeautified < un #<<*> N+ify > V-  ed1>V>V unbeautiful < un #<<*> N#ful > A > A unbeautifully << un #<<*> N#ful>A>A-ly > Dun beautifulness < < un #<<*> N#ful > A > A#ness > Nun beautify < un # < <*> N+if y > V > V rebeautify < re#<<*>N+ify > V >V

structures , an asterisk represents the ultimate base beauty . 
5 . SASDS . This program produces 3 binary matrices indicating which bases take which single affixes to form another word  . One matrix is produced for each of the major categories : nouns  , adjectives , and verbs . More detail on the contents and use of these matrices is given in Section  3  . 
6 . MORPH . This program uses the matrices created by SASDS to list bases that accept one or more given affixes  . 
7 . SAS . ( SAS is a trademark of the SAS Institute , Inc . , Cary , North Carolina . ) This is a set of statistical analysis programs which can be used to analyse the matrices produced by SASDS  . 
8 . Word Smith . This is an online dictionary system , developed at IBM , that provides fast and convenient reference to a variety of types of dictionary information  . The WordSmith functions of most use in our current research are the REVERSE dimension  ( for listing words that end the same way )  , the WEBSTER 7 application ( for checking the definitions of words we don't know  )  , and the UDED application ( for checking and revising the contents of the UDICT word list  )  . 
3. Detailed Methods
Our research can be conveniently described as a twostage process  . During the first stage , we endeavored to produce a list of morphologically active base words from which other English words can be derived by affixation  . 
The term " morphologically active " means that a word can potentially serve as the base of a large number of affixed derivatives  . Having such words is important for stage two , where patterns of affixation become more obvious when we have more instances of bases that exhibit them  . We conjectured that words which were frequent in the language have a higher likelihood of participating in word-formation processes  , owe began our search with the 6 , 000 most frequent words in the
K&F word list.
The GETBASES programseg regated these words into two categories : morphologically simple words  ( i . e . , those for which UDICT produced a structure containing no affixes  ) and morphologically complex words . At the same time , GETBASES discarded words that were not morphologically interesting  ; these included proper nouns , words not belonging to the major categories , and nonlemma forms of irregular words . ( For example , the past participled one does not take affixes , although its lemmado will accept  #able as in doable  ) GETBASES next considered the ultimate bases of the morphologically complex words  . Any base which did not also appear in the K&F word list was discarded  . The remaining bases were added to the original list of morphologically simple words  . After removing duplicates , we obtained a list of approximately 3 , 0 00 very frequent bases which we conjectured were morphologically active  . 
Development of the GETBASES program was an iterative process  . The primary type of change made at each iteration was to correct and improve the UDICT grammar and morphological nalysis mechanism  . Because the constraints on the output of GETBASES were clear  ( and because it was obvious when we failed to meet them  )  , the creation of GETBASES proved to be a very effective way to guide improvements to UDICT  . The more important of these improvements are discussed in 
Section 4.3.
For stage two of our project , we used ANALYSE to process the " complete " word list  , as described in Section 2 . That is , for each word , UDICT was asked to produce a morphological nalysis  . Whenever the ultimate base for one of the ( morphologically complex ) words appeared on our list of 3 , 000 bases , the derived word and its structure were added to the list of such pairs ' associ-ated with that base  . ANALYSE yielded , therefore , a list of 3 , 000 sublists of \[ word , structure \] pairs , with each sublist named by one of our base words . We called this result BASELIST .

The NOUNS , ADJECTIVES , and VERBS matrices froln SASDS . 

Our first indepth study of this material involved the process of adding a single affix to a base word to form another word  . By applying SASDS to BASELIST , we obtained 3 matrice showing for each base which affixes it did and did not accept  . The noun matrix contained 1900 bases ; the adjective matrix contained 850 bases ; and the verb matrix contained 1600 bases .   ( Since the originalist of bases contained words belonging to multiple major categories  , these counts add up to more than 3 , 000 . The ANALYSE program used the part-of-speech assignments from UDICT to disambiguate such homographs  . ) Figure 2 contain samples taken from the noun , adjective , and verb matrices . For each matrix , the horizontal axis shows the complete list of affixes  ( for that part-of-speech ) covered in our study . The vertical axes give contiguous samples of our ultimate bases  . 
Our results are by no means perfect . Some of our misanalyses come about because of missing constraints in our grammar  . The process of correcting these errors is discussed in Section  4  . Sometimes there are genuine ambiguities , as with the words refuse ( < re#<fuse > V > V ) and preserve ( < pre#<serve > V > V )  . In the absence of information about how an input word is pronounced or what it means  , it is difficult to imagine how our analyser can avoid producing the structures shown  . 
Some of our problems are caused by the fact that the complete word list is alternately too large and not large enough  . It includes the word artal , ( plural of rod , a Middle Eastern unit of weight ) which our rules dutifully , if incorrectly , analyse as < < art > N + al > A . Yet it fail ~ to include angelhood , even though angel bears the \[+ human \] feature that  #hood seems to require  . 
Despite such errors , however , most of the analyses in these matrices are correct and provide a useful basis for our analytical work  . We employed a variety of techniques to examine these matrices  , and the BASELIST . 
Our primary approach was to use SAS , MORPH , and ANALYSES to suggest hypotheses about affix attachment  . We then used MORPH , Word Smith , and UDICT ( via changes to the grammar ) to test and verify those hypotheses . Hypotheses which have so far survived our tests and our skepticism are given in Section  4  . 
4. Results
Using them cthods described , we have produced , results which enhance our understanding of morphological processes  , and have produced improvements in the morphological naly si system  . We present here some of what we have already learned  . Continued research using our approach and data will yield furthe results  . 
4.1 Methodological Results
It is significant that we were able to perform this research with generally available materials  . With the exception of the K&F word frequency list  , our word lists were obtained from commercially available dictionaries  . 
This workforms a natural accompaniment to another Lexical Systems project  , reported in Chodorow , et al (1985) , in which semantic information is extracted from commercial dictioriaries  . As the morphology project identifies lexical information that is relevant  , variations of the semantic extraction methods may be used to populate the dictionary with that information  . 
As has already been pointed out , our rules leave a residue of mis-analysed words , which shows up ( for example ) as errors in our matrices . Although we can never eliminate this residue , we can reduce its size by introducing additional constraints into our grammar as we discover them  . For example , chicken was mis-analysed as < < chic > A+en>V . As we show in greater detail below , we now know that the + ensuffix requires a\[+ Germanic \] base  ; since chicis\[-Germanic\[ , we can avoid them is analysis . Similarly we can avoid analysing legal as < < leg > N + al > A by observing that + al requires a\[- Germanic \] base while legis\[+Germanic\]  . Finally , we now have several ways to avoid them is analysis of maizeas << ma > N + i z e > V  , including the observation that + ize does not accept monosyllabic bases  . We don't expect , however , to find a constraint that will deal correctly with words like artal  . 
In the introduction , we pointed out that one of our goals was to build a system which can handle coinages  . With respect to the 63 , 000-wordUDICT word list , the quarter-million-word complete word list can be viewed as consisting mostly of coinages  . The fact that our analyser has been largely successful at analysing the words on the complete word list means that we are close to meeting our goal  . What remains is to exploit our research results in order to reduce our mis-analysed residue as much as possible  . 
124 4.2 Linguistic Results
Linguistically significant generalizations that have resulted so far can be encoded in the form of conditions and assertions in our word formation rule grammar  ( see Byrd ( 1983a ) ) . They typically constrain interactions between specific affixes and particular groups of words  . 
The linguistic on straints fall into at least three categories :  ( 1 ) syllabic structure of the base word ;   ( 2 ) phonemic nature of the final segment of the base word  ; and (3) etymology of the base word , both derived and underived . Each of these is covered below . Some of these constraints have been informally observed by other researchers  , but some have not . 
Constraints on the Syllabic structure of the base word  . It is commonly known that the length of a base word can affect an inflectional process such as comparative formation in English  . One can distinguish between short and long words where \[+ short \] indicates two or fewer syllables and\[+long\]indicates two or more syllables  . 
For example , a word such as big which is \[+ short \] can take the affixes-er and-est  . In contrast , words which are \[- short \] cannot , cf . possible , * possible r,*possiblest . 
(There are additional constraints on comparative formation  , which we will not go into here . We give here only the simplified version . ) We have found that other suffixes appear to require the feature \[+ short\]  . For example , nouns that take the suffix  #ish tend to be \[+ short \]  . The actual results of our analysis how that no words of four syllables took  #is hand only seven words of three syllables took  #ish  . In contrast , a total of 221 one and two syllable words took this suffix . The suffix thus preferred one syllable words over two syllable words by a factor of four  ( 178 one syllable words over 43 two syllable words )  . Compare boy ~ boyish with mimeograph/mimeographish . T is is not to say that a word like mimeographish is necessarily ill-formed  , but that it is less likely to occur , and in fact did not occur in a list like Merriam ( 1963 )  . 
Two other suffixes also appear to select for number of syllables in the base word  . In this case the denominal verb suffixes + ize and + if y are nearly in complementary distribution  . Our data show that of the approximately 200 bases which take+ize , only seven are monosyllabic . 
Compare this with the suffix + tfy which selects for about  100 bases , of which only one is trisyllabic and 17 are disyllabic . Thus , + t . ?v tends to select for\[+short\]bases while + ize tends to select for \[+ long \] ones  . As with  #ish , there appears to be motivation for syllabic structure constraints on morphological rules  . 
In the case of + ize and + if yit appears that the syllabic structure of the suffix interacts with the syllabic structure of the base  . Informally , the longer suffix selects for a \[+ short\] base  , and the shorter suffix selects for a \[+ long\] base  . Our speculation is that this may be related to the notion of optimal target metrical structure as discussed in Hayes  ( 1984 )  . This notion , however , is the subject of future research . 
The Final Segment of the Base Word . The phonemic nature of the final segment appears to affect the propensity of a base to take an affix  . Consider the fact that there occurred some 48 + ary adjectives derived from nouns in our data . Of these , 46 are formed from bases ending with alveolars . The category alveolar includes the phonemes/t /   , /d / , / n / , / s / , / z / , and /1/ . The two exceptions are customary and palmary . Again , in a word recognizer , if a base does not end in one of these phonemes , then it is not likely to be able to serve as the base of + ary  . We have also found that the ual spelling of the + alsuffix prefers a preceding alveolar  , such as gradual , sexual , habitual . 
A no the result related to the alveola requirement is an even more stringent requirement of the nominalizing suffix + ity  . Of the approximately 150 nouns taking + ity , only three end in the phoneme/t/(chastity , sacrosanctity , and vastity ) . In addition the adjectivizer+cy seems also to attach primarily to bases ending in / t /  . The exceptions are normal cy and supremacy . 
Etymology of the Base Word . The feature \[+ German ic\] is said to be of critical importance in the analysis of English morphology  ( Chomsky and Halle 1968 , March and 1969) . In two cases our data show this to be true . The suffix + en , which creates verbs from adjectives , as in moist ~ moisten , yielded a total of fifty-five correct analyses . Of these , forty-three appear in Merriam (1963) , and of these forty-one are of Germanic origin . The remaining two are quieten and neaten . The former is found only in some dialects . It is clear that + enverbs a I'e : oyer whelmingly formed on \[+ Germanic \] bases  . 
The feature \[ German ic\] is also significant with + aladjectives  . In contras to the + enstfffix , +al selects for the feature \[- German ic\] . In our data , there were sometives derived from nouns by + al suffixation  . Of the base words which appear in Merriam (1963) , only one , bridal , is of Germanic origin . However , interestingly , it turns out that the analysis < < bride > N + al > A is spurious  , since bridal is the reflex of an OldEnglish form brydealu  , a noun referring to the wedding feast . The adjective bridal is not derived from bride . Rather it was zero-derived historically from the nominal form  . 
Finally , other findings from our analysis how that no words formed with the Anglo-Saxon prefixes a +  , be + or for + will negate with the Latinate prefixes non  #or in #  . This supports the findings of March and (1969) . 
Observe that in these examples , the constraint applies between affixes , rather than between an affix and a base . The addition of an affix thus creates a new complex lexical item  , complete with additional properties which can constrain further affixation  . 
In sum , our sample findings suggest a number of new constraints on morphological rules  . In addition we provide evidence and support for the observations of others  . 
4.3 Improvements to the Implementation
In addition to using our linguistic results to change the grammar  , we have also made a variety of improvements to UDICT's morphological analyser which interprets that grammar  . Some have been for our own convenience , such as streamlining the procedures for changing and compiling the grammar  . Two of the improvements , however , result directly from the analysis of our word lists and files  . These improvements represent generalizations over classes of affixes  . 
First , we observed that , with the exception of be , do , and go , no base spelled with fewer than three characters ever takes an affix  . Adding code to the analyser to restrict the size of bases has had an important effect in avoiding spurious analyses  . 
A more substantial result is that we have added to UDICT a comprehensives t of English spelling rules which make the right spelling adjustment so the base of a suffix virtually all of the time  . These rules , for example , know when and when not to double final consonants  , when to retain silente preceding a suffix beginning with a vowel  , and when to add k to a base ending in c . These rules are a critical aspect Of UDICT's ability to robustly handle normal English input and to avoid misanalyses  . 
5. Further Analyses and Plans
When we have modified our grammar to incorporate re-suits we have obtained  , and added the necessary supporting features and attributes to the words in UDICT's word list  , we will rerun our programs to produce files based on the corrected analyses that we will obtain  . 
These files will , in turn , be used for further analysis in the Lexical Systems project  , and by other researchers . 
We plan to continue our work by looking for more constraints on affixation  . A reasonable , if ambitious , goal is to achieve a word formation rule grammar which is " tight " enough to allow us to reliably generate words using derivational affixation  . Such a capability would be important , for example , in a translation application where idiomaticness often requires that a translated concept appear with a different part-of-speech tan in the source language  . 
Further research will investigate patterns of multiple affixation  . Are there any interdependencies among affixes when more than one appear in a given word ? If so  , what are they ? One important question in this area has to do with violations of the Affix Ordering Generalization  ( Siegel ( 1974 ) ) , sometimes known as " bracketing paradoxes " . 
A related issue which emerge during our work concerns prefixes  , such as pre  #and over # , which apparently ignore the category of their bases  . It may be that recursive application of prefixes and suffixes is not the best way to account for such prefixes  . We would like to use our data to address this question  . 
Our data can also be used to investigate the morphological behavior of words which are " zero -derived " or " drifted " from a different major category  . 
Such words are the nouns considerable , accused , and beyond listed in Merriam (1967) . Contrary to our goal for GETBASES ( to produce a list of morphologically active bases  )  , these words never served as the base for derivational affixation in our data  . We conjecture that some mechanism in the grammar prevents them from doing so  , and plan to investigate the nature of that mechanism  . 
Obtaining results from investigations of this type will not only be important for producing a robust word analysis system  , it will also significantly contribute to our theoretical understanding of morphological phenomena  .
