l . OINTRODUCTION
This paper describes the development of a NiPS for analyzing domain-specific as well as temporal information in a well-defined text type  . The analysis , i . e . output , of the NLPS is a data structure which serves as the input to an expert system  . The ultimate Real is to allow the user of the expert system to enter data into the system by means of NL text which follows the linguistic conventions of English  . 
The particular domain chosen to illustrate the underlying theory of such a systemts that of medical descriptive re ? is which deal with patients ' case histories of Liverdiseases  . 
The texts are taken unedtted from the Jourmal of the Amerz can Medical As ~ oc?ation  . The infor-mation contained in those texts serves as input to PATREC  , an intelligent database assistant for MDX , the medical expert system\[Ch and rase ka ran 831 . The objectives of this research are twofold , whereby thesy ~ ; tem described above is meant to be a particular implementation of a genera \ [ NLP which cou ld be used for a variety of domains  . 
The first objective is to provide a theory for processing temporal information conta in ed in a given text  . The second objective is to argue for a knowledge-based approach to NL processing in which the parsing procedure is driven by extra Linguistic knowledge  . 
MyNLPS , called GROK ,\[ Gran~nattcal
Representation of Obiective Knowledge \] is a functioning program which is implemented in EL\ [SP and EFRL on a  DEC20/60  . The full documentation , including source code is available IO bermeier 8A  \] . The program performs the following tasks : ( L ) parse a text from a medicaliour na L while us ing Linguistic and extra Linguistic knowledge  ; (2) map the parsed
Linguistic structure into an event-represent at ion  ;   ( 3 ) draw temporal and factual inferences within the domain of Liverdiseases  ;   ( 4 ) create and update a database containing the pertinent information about a patient  . 
2.0 OVER VIRW 2.l A Samp Le Text:
The user of my NLPS can enter a text of the format given in FiRure LL The texts which the NLPS accepts are descriptive for a particular domain  . The information-processing task consists of the analysis of Linguistic information into data structures which are chronologically ordered by the NLPS  .

The second module consists of a bottom-up parser which matches the output from the lexical component to a set of augmented phrase structure rules  2  . The third module consists of a knowledge base which contains the domain-specific information as well as temporal knowledge  . The knowledge base is accessed during the processing of the text in conjunction with the augmented phrase structure rules  . 
The output of the program includes a lexical feature assignment as given in Figure  2  , a phrase-structure representation as given in Figure  3  , and a knowledge representation as provided in Figure  4  . The resulting knowledge representation of mvNLPS consists of a series of events which are extracted from the text and chronologically ordered by the NLPS based on the stored knowledge the system has about the domain and ~ enera\[ temporal re\[ations  .

If a doctor were given a patient's case history ( see Figurel )  , he would read the text and try to extract the salient pieces of information which are necessary for his diagnosis  . 
In this particular text type , he would be interested in the sign , symptoms , and laboratory data , as well as the medical history of the patient . The crucial point here by is the temporal information associated with the occurrences of these data  . In general , he would try to cluster certain abnormal manifestations to form hypotheses which would result in a coherent diagnosis  . The clustering would be based on the temporal succession of the information in the text  . Each manifestation of abnormalities \[ will refer to as an " event "  . 
Each event is defined and related to other events by means of temporal information explicitly or implicitly provided in the text  . 
An important notion which \[ use in my program is chat of a key event  4  . " Events are or ~ anize ~ around key events ( which are domain-specific in the medical domain , some of the important ones are ' admission ' , ' surgery ' , ' accident ' , etc . ) , so that ocher events are typically stated or ordered with respect to these key events "\[ Micra\[  82\]  .

(\[ ) This 80-year-old Caucasian female complained of nause a , vomiting , abdominals we\[\[in~~ndia undice . 
In the sample text in Figurel , the first sentence , given in ( l ) requires the following domain concepts : Patient : person identified by age  , sex , and profession , whose signs , symptoms , and laboratory data will be given . 
Symptoms : manifestations of abnormalities repor\ [ ed by the patient  . Certain symptoms have to be further defined : swell in ~ needs a characterization as to where it occurs  . Pain can be characterized by its location , intensity . 
and nature ( e.g ., " shooting ").
Signs : abnormalities found by the physician such as fever  , jaundice , or swelling . 
4The notion of " key event " is further discussed in  4  . 3 " Key Events " . 
Whether " fever " is a sign or a symptom is indicated by the verb  . Therefore , the verbs have features which indicate if the following is a sign or a symptom  . There are no explicit temporal indicators in (1) , except the tense marker on the verb . The doctor , however , knows chat case histories ordinarily use " admission " as a reference point  .

The sentence in ( 2 ) requires a temporal concept " year " in conjunction with the numerical value " six "  , it also requires the concept " dur-ation " to represent the meaning of for  . The " key event " at admission is mentioned explicitly and must be recognized as a concept by the system  . 
After selecting the facts on the basis of about 35 case descriptions as well as previous research of the medical sublanguage \[ Hirschman  83\]   5   , \[ organized them into schemas based on what is known " about the particular text type  . 
\[ n\]Bonnet79\] , a medical summary is characterized as " a sequence of episodes that correspond Cophrases  , sentences , or groups of sentences dealing with a single topic  . These constitute the model and are represented bv schemas "\ [ Bonn et  79  ,  80\] . Schemas for the medical domain in Bonnet's system are $ PATIENT-iNFORMATION  ( e . g . , sex , job ), SSICNS ( e . g . , \[ ever , jaundice ) . \[ nGROK , luse the schemas SREPORT-SICN , SREPORT-SYMPTOM , SREPORT-LAB-DATA , SPATIENT-\[NFO . Each of my schemas indicates " who reports , what cowhom , and when " . The $ REPORT-SYMPTOM schema has the following elements : verb  ( unknown )  , subject ( patient ) , object-(symptom ) , indirect object ( medic ) , time ( default is admission ) . 
After selecting the facts on the basis of the domain  , and organizing them on the basis of the text - type  , \[ add one fact for putting the information into the target representation  . 
The target representation consists of a temporal indicator attached to a domain-specific fact what \[ had referred to in as " event "  . The event structure contains the following elements : name of domain-specific concept  , reference point , duration ( known or unknown ) , and relation to reference point ( e . g . , before , after) . 
5 1 use ten types of domain-specific facts : sign  , symptom , lab data , body-part , etc .   , I use six temporal facts : month , year , day , week , duration , period , i . e . , " for how long " . 
113.2 The Flow of Control
In addition to domain-specific knowledge , a person reading a text also uses his linguistic knowledge of the English grammar  . The problem for a NLPS is how to integrate linguistic and extralinguistic knowledge  . The dominant paradigm in computational linguistics uses syntactic and morphological information before considering extralinguistic knowledge  ; if extralinguistic knowledge is used at all . 
Considering syntactic knowledge before any other type of knowledge has the following problems which are avoided if enough contextual information can be detected by the knowledge base of the NIPS : ? global ambiguities cannot be resolved  ( e . g . , Visitin ~ relatives can be bortn ~ ) ? word class ambiguities ( e . g . , bank ) and structural ambiguities cause multiple parses  ( e . g . ,\[ saw them an on the hill with the telescope ) . 
Moreover , psycholinguistic experiments have shown \[ Marslen-Wilson  75  , Marslen-Wilson 78 , Marsten-Wilson 801 that the syntactic . , nalvsis of a sentence does not precede higher level processing bu ~ interacts with seman=ic and pragmatic information  . These findings are , to some extent , controversial , and not accepted by all psv cholin Ruists . 
In my system , knowledge about the domain , the text-type , and the tarRet representation is used before and together with syntactic information  . The syntactic information helps to select the interpretation of the sentence  . 
Syntax functions as a filter for processing information  . \[ t selects the constituents of a sentence , and groups them into larger " chunks " , called phrases . The phrase types noun phrases \[ NP\] and verb phrase \[ VPI contain procedures to form concepts  ( e . g . , " abdominal pain ") . These concepts are combined by function special ists  . 
Function specialists consists of procedures attached to function words  ( e . ~ . , prepositions , determiners ) , fnflectional morphemes , and boundary markers ( e . g . , comma , period ) . 
Technically , \[ distinguish between phrase ~ pecialists and function specialists  . The phrase ~ pecialists interact with extra \ [ tnguistic knowledge to determine which concepts are ey-pressed in a text  , the function specialists de ~ ermine locally what relation these concepts have to each other  . So in general , the phrase specialists are activated before the function specialists  . 
To illustrate this process , consider the sentence : ( 3 ) The patient complained of shoot tn~pain across the flanks for three days before admission  . 
The NP-specialist combines the and patient into a phrase  . The central processing component in the sentence ls the VP-specialist  . Its task is to find the verb-particle construction  ( complain of )  , and the object ( e . g . , shoot in ~ pain ) . The VP-specialist also looks at the syntactic and semantic characteristics of complain o__f_f  . It notes that complain of expects a symptom in its object position  . The expectation of a symptom invokes the schema " report-symptom "  . At this point , the schema could fill in missing information , e . ~ .   , if no subject had been mentioned , it could indicate that the patient is the subject  . The schema identifies the current topic of the sentence  , vlz . , " symptom " . 
CROK next encounters the word shoot in ~.
This word has no further specification besides that of be in ~ used as an adjective  . The head noun pain points to a more complex entity " pain " which expects further spec if ications  ( e . ~ . , location , type) . It first tries to find any further specifications within the : malvzed part of the NP  . \[ tfinds shoot in ~ and adds this characteristic to the entity " pain "  . Since " pain " is usually specified in terms of i ts location  , a place adverbial is expected . Upon the eqtry of across , the entity " pain " includes " acro~s " as a localion marker  , expect in ~ as the next word a body part . The next word , flank is a body part , and the " pain " entity is completed . Note here , that the attachment of the preposition was ~ uided by the information contained in the knowledge base  . 
The next word for is a function word which can indicate duration  . To determine which adverbial for Lntroduces , the system has to wait for the information from the following Nl'-specialist  . After the numeric value " three " , the temporal indicator " dav " identifies for as a duration marker  . 
Explicit ~ emporal indicators such as day , week , or month , under certain conditions in-troduce new events  . As soon as GROK verifies that a temporal indicator started an event  , it fills in the information from the " report-: < x x "  , ~ chema . The new event representation includes thes ign  , symptom , or laboratory data , and the temporal indicator . The last two words in the sample sentence before adm?ssion  , provide Khemissing information as to what " key event " the ~ ewly created event\[s related to  . 
Once a new event frame or domain-specific frame is instnntiated  ) GROK can use the infor-mation associated with each event frame  ( e . g . ) duration , key-event ) , together with the infor-mation from the domain -specific frame  ( e . g .   , the pain frame contains slots for specifying the location  , intensity , and type of pain ) to interpret the text . 
12 4 . 0 TEMPORAL\[NFO\[~ATION PROCESSINC 4 . 1 Prob lems The inherent problems of text comprehension from an information processing viewpoint are how to deal with the foremost problems in computational NLP  ( e . g . , ambiguity , anaphora , ellipsis , conjunction ) , including the foremost problems in temporal information processing  ( e . g . , implicit time reference , imprecision of reference ) . 
Within A\[and computational linguistics , only a few theories have been proposed for the processing of temporal information \[ Kahn  77  , Hirschman 8\ [ , Kamp 7g , Allen 83 l . in particular , a theory of how a NLP can comprehend temporal relations in a written text is still missing  . \[ nmy research , \[ present a theory for processing temporal information in a NLPS for a well-defined class of technical descriptive texts  . The texts deal with a specific domain and tasks which require the processing of linguistic information into a chronological order of events  . The problems for processing the temporal information contained in the text include : ? a NLPS has to work with implicit temporal information  . 
AL though in ( I ) , no explicit temporal reference is present , the NLPS has to detect the implied information from the context and the extra Linguistic knowledge available  . 
? a NLPS has to work with fuzzy information . The reference tO for many years in () is fuzzy , and yet a NiPS has to relate it to the chrono logy of the case  . 
? a NLPS has to order the events in their chronology although they are not temporally ordered in the text  . 
4.2 Solutions
Hv solution to the problems discussed in the previous section lies within the computational paradigm as opposed cothe Chomsky an generative paradi ~ m  . The comFutation a L paradigm focuses nn how the comprehension processes are organized whereas within the generative paradiRm  , linguistic performance is of less importance for a Linguistic theory than Linguistic competence  . Within the computational paradigm , the representation and use of extra-Linguistic knowledge is a mai or part of studying Linguistic phenomena  , whereas generative linguists separate linguistic phenomena which fall within the realm of syntax from other cognitive aspects \[ W ~nograd  83   ,  21 \ ]  . 
Functionality is the central theoretical concept upon which the design of GROK rests  . 
What is important for comprehending language is the function of an utterance in a given situation  . Words are used for their meaning , and the meaning depends on the use in a given context  . The meaning of a word is subject to change according to the context  , which is based on the function of the words that make up the text  . Therefore , my approach to building a NLPS focuses on modeling the context of a text in a particular domain  . \[ amprimarily concerned with the relationship between writer-text-reader  , rather than with the relationship between two sentences  . The use of the context for parsing requ Lres a knowledge representation of the domain  , and the type of text , in addition to linguistic and empirical knowledge . 
In contradistinction to NLPSs which use syntactic information first\[Thompson  8\[\]  , and which possibly generate unnecessary structural descriptions  , mv system uses higher\[eve\[information ( e . ~ .   , domain , text-type ) before and together with usua LL vasmaller amount o\[syntactic information  , in GROK , the syntactic information selects between contextually interpretations o\[the text ~ untax acts as ~ ill = or for the N\[  . IJS . 
in contradistinction to NLPSs which use conceptual information first\[S chank  75\]  , GROK , partially due to the limited information pro -cess in ? task and the particular domain  , starts out with a small knowledge base and builds updata structures which are used subsequently in the processing of the text  . The knowledge base of my system contains only the information it absolutely needs  , whereas Schankian scripts have problems with when to activate scripts and when to exit them  . 
4.3 Key Events
Temporal information in a text is conveyed by explicit temporal indicators  , implicit temporal relations based on what one knows about written texts  ( e . g . , " time moves forward "), and " key events " . \[ define a key event as a domain-specific concept which is used roorder and group events a round a particular key event  . \[ nmy the or v , temporal processing is based on the identification of key events far a parti = u Lar domain  , and their subsequent reco~uition bv the NLPS in the text  . 
Temporal indicators . in a sentence are not of equal importance . The tense mark in ? on the verb has been the Least influential ' or filling in the event structure  . For the program , the most important sources are adverbials . 
The linear sequence of sentences also contr ibutes cothese E-up of the configurations of events  . My program makes use of two generally known heuristics  ; time moves forward in a narrative if not explicitly stated otherwise  ; 
Jisordinarily the same as that in the main clause  . 
" Key events " are significant since they are used to relate events to one another  . \[ nmy theory of text processing , key events build up the temporal structure of a text  . \[ f key events for other domains can be ident if ied  , they could be used to explain how a NLPS can " comprehend " the texts of the domain in question  . 
The representation of temporal information is s ignificant \ [ nmy theory  . \[ define an event as the result of the ass ignment of a temporal value to a domain-spec if ic concept  . The structure of an event is Reneralizable to other domains  . An event consists of a domain-specific concept  , a key event , a relation toke ~ event , and a duration . \[ n the medical domain , the instantiated event contains information about how long  , and when a symptom or sign occurred , and what the kevent of the instantiated event was  . 
, \ par t from the tempora l i ssue , my research has shown that \[ f the domain and the task of the NLPS are sufficiently constra in ed  , the use of frames as a knowledge representation ~cheme is efficient in implementing CROK  . in , nv program , \[fl are used individual frames to represent single concepts  ( e . g . , pain ) . These concepts help the NLPS to access the domain -specific knowledge base  . To ? ether with the temporal indicators , the information from tneknowledge base is then t ransferred to the topmost event frame  . Procedures are then used to relate various event frames to each other  . 
The restrictions and checks on the instantiat ion of the individual frames preclude an erroneotls activation of a frame  . 
The viability of this approach shows that the idea of stereotypical represent dL\[on of information is useful for NLPS\[f properly constrained  . Mv program checks for the access-ability of the various levels of the knowledge represent at i on whenever new information is coming in  . This multilaver approach constrains the ~ nstantiatton of the event frame suffi-cient ly in order to prevent erroneous eventtnstant iation  . 
4.4 Comparison to Extant Theories on Temporal
Process in R
The overall ideas of GROK . is they re\[are ~ , r differ from ~ heextant theories and sv stems are introduced by looking at four major issues concerning temporal proces : ~ ing  . 
? temporaiiry : how is an event defined in the system  ; ho ~ is temporal information treated vis-a- .  ! . ;= he whole system ?
What search algorithms or inference procedures are provided ?? organization : are events or -ganized on a timeline  , by key events , calendar dates , before/after chains ? ? problems : how is imprecision  , fuzziness , and incompleteness of data handled ?? testing : how can the system be tested  ; by queries , proofs , etc . ? Does it have a consistency checker ? In GROK , \[ use an interval-based approach to temporal information processing  . An event is defined as an entity of finite duration  . 
As in IKamp 79 ,  3771 , event structures are transformed into instants by the Russell-Wiener construction  . 
\[ nGROK , the NLPS processes temporal ( n format \ [ on by first associating a concept with a temporal reference  , then evaluating the extension of this event . The evaluation considers syntactic ( e . ~ . , adverb ia ls ) and pragmatic information ( current time focus )  . 
Each event is represented in the knowledge base with information about when  , for how long , and what occurred . 
The parser while analyzing the sentences , orders these events according to a " key event " . 
The single events contain information about the temporal indicator which is attached to a domain-soec ~ fic fact  . The single events are connected to the respect ive " key event "  . 
" Key events " are domain-specific . \[ n general , \[q cipulate that ever v domain has a limited number of such " key events " which provide the " hooks " for the temporal structure of a domain -specific text  . 
CROK also differs from logical theories \[ n that it deals with discourse structures and their conceptual representations  , not with : solated sentences and their truth value  . \[ t is different from Kahn's rime specialist Kahn  771 in that it uses domain knowledge and " knows " about temporal relations of a particular domain  . 
Moreover , Kahn's program only accepts LiSP-like input and handled only explicit temporal information  . The use of domain-specific temporal knowled Keal soqe t =  ; CROK apart from Allen'sl , \\[len83\] temporal inference engine approach . 
GROK differs from Kamp's discourse struc tures in that it uses the notion of reference intervals that are based on conventiGnal temporal units  ( e . g . , day , week , month , year ) to organize single events into chronological order  . 
GROK is in many respects similar to research reported in \[ Hirschman \  [98 l \]: both systems deal with temporal re lations in the medical domain  ; both syatems deal with implicit and expl ic it temporal information  . GROK differs domain-specific and other extra linguistic information for analyzing the text  , whereas Hirschman relies primarily on available syntactic information  . Therefore , Hirschman's system as presented in \[ Hirschman 81\] can neither handle anaphoric references to continuous states nor represent imprecision in time specification  . 
4.5 State of \[= q~tememtatiou
GROK is a highly exploratory program.
The limitations of the current implementation are in three areas : ? The parser itself does not provide the capability of a chart parser since it will not give different interpretations of a structurally ambiguous sentences  . This type of structural ambiguity , where one constituent can belong to two or more different constructions  , would not be detected . 
? The knowledge base does not have a fully implemented frame structure  . Each ~ eneric frame has a certain number of slots that define the concept  . A generic concept ( e . g . , sign ) must have slots which contain possible attributes of the specific frame  ( e . g .   , where is the sign found ; how severe is its manifestation ) . These slots have not yet been implemented . The number of frames is strictly i/mired to the temporal frames and a few exemplary ~ eneric frames necessary to process the text  . 
? The range of phenomena is limited . Only " before-admission " references are recogn ized by the system  . Furthermore , slots that prevent the inheritance of events of limited durations are not yet in place  . 
in general , GROK is still in a developmental stage at which a number of phenomena have vet to be accounted for = hrough an implementation  . 
5 . 0 CONCLUSION\[n this paper , \[ argued for an integration of insi % hcs Rained from linguistic  , psychological , and Al-based research to provide a pragmatic theory and cognitive mode \[ of how temporal inferences can be explained within the framework of computational information processing  . A pragmatic theory focuses on the information from the context  ( e . g .   , co-text , discourse situation , intentions of interlocutors ) to explain linguistic behavior . 
I have shown how an integration of linguistic and extralinguistic knowledge achieves a form of comprehension  , where comprehension is characterized as a conversion of information based on knowledge from on representation into another  . \[ have also shown how this approach leads to a parsing technique which avoids corm ~ on pitfalls  , and , at the same time , is consistent with results in psycholinguistic research  . \[ have furthermore shown that such a procedural approach is a basis for an event based theory for temporal information processing  . 
In particular , the findings implemented in GROK show the shortcomings of the orthodox rule-based approach to language processing which reduces words to tokens in a larger context while overemphasizing the role of the phrase and sentence level  . It does this by providing a temporal knowledge representation and algorithms for processing pragmatic information which are applicable to a wider range of phenomena than most of the notable computational NL theories within the field of A\ [ Schank  8\[  , R/eger 79 , Wilks 75I , or linguistics Marcus 801 . 
\[ n particular , my research shows that ? NL can be processed realistically by a deterministic algorithm which can be interpreted in a mental model  . A realistic
NLP Stries to emulate human behavior . A deterministic parser works under the assumption that  (  \ [  ) a human NLPS makes irrevocable decisions during processing and  ( 2 ) that humans are not unconstrained " wait-and-see -parsers " Kac  821  . A mental model provides an internal representation of the state of affairs that are described in a given sentence\[Johnson-Lai rd  8 \[ I . 
? Temporal information processing is adequate ly explained only in a pragmatic theory that captures the duality of interval and poin t-based representation of time  . In my theory , temporal processing is possible because of domain-specific key events which provide the " hooks " for the temporal structure of a text  . 
? NL can be processed efficiently by a set of integrated linguistic and extralinguistic knowledge sources  .
