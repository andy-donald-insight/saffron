To facilitate work in discourse interpretation , the logical form of English sentences should be both close to English and syntactically simple  . In this paper i proposes logical notation which is first-order and u on intensional  , sad for which semantic tnmsla-tion can be naively compositional  . The key move is to expand what kinds of entities one allows in one's ontology  , rather than complicating the logical notation , the logical form of sentences , or the semantic translation process . Three classical problems - opaque adverbials , the distinction between dere and ded it to belief reports  , and the problem of identity in intensional contexts-are examined for the dil ~ cuities they pose for this logical notation  , and it is shown that the difficulties can be overcome  . 
The paper closes with s statement about the view of semantics that is presupposed by this appro  , -'h . 
1 Motivation
The real problem in natural language processing is the interpretation of discourse  . Therefore , the other aspects of the total proces should be in the service of discourse interpretation  . This includes the semantic translation of sentences into slogical form  , and indeed the logical notation itsel ? Discourse interpretation processes  , as ! see them , are inferential processes that manipulate or perform deductions on logical expressions encoding the information in the text and on other logical expressions encoding the speaker's and helper's background knowledge  . These considerations lead to two principal criteria for ? logical notation  . 
Criterion I : The notation should be as close to English as possible  . This makes it easier to specify the rules for translation between English and the formal language  , mad also makes it easier to encode in logical notation facts we normally think of in English  . The ideal choice by this criterion is English itself  , but it fails monumentally on the second criterion . 
Criterionlh The notation should be syntactically simple  . 
Since discourse processes are to be defined primarily in terms of manipulations performed on expressions in the logical notation  , the simpler that notation , the easier it will be to define the discourse operations  . 
The development of such a logical notation is usually taken to be a very hard problem  , i believe this is because researchers have imposed upon themselves several additional constraints - to adhere to stringent ontological scruples  , to explain a number of mysteriou syntactic facts ms a byproduct of the notation  , and to encode efficient deduction techniques in the notation  . 
Most representational difficulties go ? way if one rejects these constraints  , and there are good reasons for rejecting each of the constr~nts  . 
Ontological scruples : Researchers in philosophy and lint~uis-tics have typically restricted themselves to very few  ( altho*Igh?strange as sortment of ) kinds of entities-physical objects , numbers , sets , times , possible worlds , propositions , events , and situations-mad all of these but the first have been controversial  . 
Quine has been the greatest exponent of ontological chastity  , ills argument is that in any scientific theory , " we adopt , at \[ eastin-s of as * as we are reasonable , the simplest conceptual scheme into which the disordered fragments of our experience can be fitted and arranged  . * ( Quine , 1953, p .  16 . ) But he goes onto say that " simplicity . . . is not a clear and unambiguous idea ; and it is quite capable of presenting a double or multiple standard  . " ( Ibid . , p .  17 . ) Minimising kinds of entities is not the only way to achieve simplicity in a theory  . The aim in this enterprise is to achieve simplicity by minimizing the complexity of the rules in the system  . It turns out this can be achieved by multiplying kinds of entities  , by ' allowing as an entity everything that can be referred to by a noun phrase  . 
Syntactic explanation : The argument here is easy . It would be pleasant if an explanation of , say , the syntactic behavior of count nouns and mass nouns fell out of our underlying ontological structure at no extra cost  , but if the extra cost is great complication in statements of discourse operations  , it would be quite unpleasant . In constructing a theory of discourse interpretation  , it doesn't make sense for us to tie our hands by requiring syntsctie explanations as well  . The problem of discourse is at least an order of maguitude harder than the problem of syntax  , and syntax shouldn't be in the driver's seat . 
Efficient deduction : There is ? long tradition in artificial intelligence of building control information into the notation  . 
and indeed much work in knowledge representation is driven by this consideration  . Semantic networks and other notational systems built  , round hierarchies ( Quillian ,  1068;  . ~ immons , 1973; Hendrix ,  1975 ) implicitly assign a low cost to certain types of syllogistic remmning  . The KL-ONE representation language ( Schmolze and Brat . brunn , 1982) has a variety of notational devices , each with an associated efficient deduction procedure  . 
Hayes ( 1979 ) has argued that frame representations ( Minsky , 1975; Bobrow and Winogrsd ,  1977 ) should be viewed amsets of predicate calculus axioms together with a control component for drawing certain kinds of inferences quickly  . In quite a different vein , Moore ( 1980 ) uses a possible worlds notation to model knowledge madaction in part to avoid inefficiencies in theorem-proving  . 
By contrast , l would argue against building et ? ciencies into the notation  . From a psychological point of view , this allows us to abstract away from the details of implementation a particular computational device  , increasing the generality of the theory . From a technological point of view , it reflects a belief that we must first determine mpirically the must common classes of inferences required for discourse processing and only then seek algorithms for optimizing them  . 
In this paper I propmes flit logical notation with an ontologically promiscuous semantics  . One's first naive guess as to how to represent a simple sentence like 
A boy builds sboat.
is as follows : (3z , y ) build(z , g ) Aboy ( z ) ^ boat ( v ) This simple approach seems to break down when we encounter the more ditcuit phenomena of natural language  , like tense , intensional contexts , and adverbials , as in the sentence
A boy wanted to build a boat quickly.
These phenomena have led students of language to introduce significant complications in their logical notations for representing sentences  . My approach will be to maintain the syntactic simplicity of the logical notation and expand the theory of the world implicit in the semantics to accommodate this simplicity  . 
The representation f the = hove sentence , as is justified below , is (:: lCl , ? Z , el , Z , V ) Past(el ) Awnn Ll(et , Z , ez ) Aquiekl(e2 , us )
Abmld ~ ( es , zg ) Abey(z ) Aboat(g)
That is , el occurred in the peat , where elisz's wanting e ~ , which is the quickness of us , which is z's building of y , where z is a boy and y is a boat . 
In brief , the logical form of natural anguage sentences will be a conjunction of atomic predications in which all variables are existentially quantified with the widest poesible scope  . Predicates will be identical or nearly identical to natural language morphemes  . There will be noftmctious , fun ? * ionals , nested quantifiers , disjunctions , negations , or modal or inteusional operators . 
3 The Logical Notation
Davidson ( 1967 ) proposed a treatment of action sentences in which events are treated as individuals  . This facilitated the representation f sentences with time and place adverbials  . Thus we can view the sentences
John ran on Monday.
John ran in S in Fnmciaco.
as mmerting the existence of & ruxming event by John and asserting a relation between the event and Monday or San Francisco  . 
We can similarly view the sentence
John ran slowly.
as expressing an attribute about a running event . Treating events as individuals is a be useful beem methey can be a cgu-merits of statements about cremes : Because he wanted to get there first  , Johnran . 
Because John ran , he arrived sooner than anyone else . 
They can be the objects of propositional attitudes : 
Bill was surprised that John ran.
Finally , this approach accomodates the facts that events can be nominalized and can be referred to pronominally : 
John's running tired himout.
Johnran , and Billsawit.
But virtually every predication that can he made in natural language can be specified uto time and place  , be modified adverbially , function a ~ a cause or effect of something else , be the object of a propositional attitude , be nominalized , and be referred to by a pronoun . It is therefore convenient to extend Davidson's approach to all predications  . That is , corresponding to any predication that can he made in natural lan~tage  , we will say there is an event , or state , or condition , orsitl = ation . 
or " eventuality ' , or whatever , in the world that it refer ~ to . 
This approach might he called " on tn logical promiscuity '  . 0 lie abandons all ontologicals cruples . 
Thus we would like to have in our logical notation the possi-bility of an extra argument in e~h predication referring to the " condition " that exists when that predication is true  . However . 
especially for expository convenience , we would like to retain the option of not specifying that extra argument when it is not needed and would only get in our way  . Ilence , I propose a logical notation that provides two sets of predicates fhat are ~ ystem-atically related  , by introducing what might I ) erailed a " nominalization " operator ' .   ( : or responding lue very rl-ary predicate pthere will he an n+I-ary predical ci~t who  . ~ e(i~targ qln lenl can he thought of a . ~ the condilion that mhl ~'* henp is rnw of the suh sequent ar~lments  . Thus . if r .   . ( J)me,~ns that . John runs , run'(E , J ) means that /': is a running eventhy , John . or John's running , if slipper v(F ) means that floor F is slippery , then Jlipper v ~( E , F ) means that ~" is the condition of F's being slippery  , or F's slipperiness . The effect of this notational maneuver is to provide handles by which various predications can be grasped by higher predications  . A similar approach haL ~ been in many AI systems . 
In discourse one not only makes predications about suchephe-mera as events  , states and conditions . One also refers to crttities that do not actually exist  . Our notation must thus have a way of referring to such entities  . We therefore take our model to heaPlatonic universe which contains everything that can he spoken of-objects  , events , states , conditions - whether they exist in the realworld or not  . It then may or may not be a property of such entities that they exist in the real world  . In the sentence ( l ) John worships Zeus , the worshipping event and John , but not Zeus , exist in the real world , but all three exist in the ( over populated ) Platonicuni-veto . Similarly , in
John wants to fly.

John's flying exists in the Platonic universe but not in the real world  . l " The logical notation then is just first-order predicate calculus  , where the universe of discourse is a rich set of individuals  , which are real , possible auad even impossible objects , events , conditions , eventualities , and so on . 
Existence and truth in the actual universe are treated as predications about individuals in the Platonic universe  . For this purpose , we use a predicate Ezist . The formula Ezist ( JOll N ) says that the individual in the Platonic universe denoted by JOHN exists in the actual universe  , s The formula (2) E zistg )^ run '( E , JOHN ) says that the condition E of John's r~mning exists in the actual universe  , or more simply that " John rains " is true , or still more simply , that John runs . A shorter way to write it is run ( JO lfN ) . 
Although for a simple sentence like " John rmls ~ , a logical form like (2) seems a bit over blown , when we rome to real sentences in English discourse with their variety of tenses  , modalities and adverbial modifiers , the more elaborated logical form is necessary . Adopting the notation of (2) has H weth , ct of splitting a sentence into its propositional content-run '  ( L ' , JOHN ) and its assertional claim-gzist(E) . This frequently turns out to be useful , as the latter is often in doubt until substantial work has been done by discourse interpretation processes  . An entire sentence may be embedded within a a indirect proof or other extended counts factual  . 
We are now in a position to state formally the systematic relation between the unprimed and primed prrtlicat ~ as an axiom schema  . For every n-sty predicate p , ( V et .   .   .   .   . z , i ) p(zl .   .   .   .   . z,i)~(3e)Ezi,,t(e)Ap'(e,zt .   .   .   .   . z , i ) That is , if p is true of zl . . . . . z , s , then there is a condition e of p's being true of zt  ,   . . . , z ~, amd ~ exists . Conversely , ( re , zl . . . . . z , , ) gzist(e ) Ap'(e , z, .   .   .   .   . z , , ) ~ p(z , .   .   .   .   . z , , ) Thai is . if ? is the condition of p's being tnle of zt . . . . . Jr , , , and e exists , then p is true of = , , .   .   . , z , , . We can compress these axiom schemas into one formula:  '31   ( V i i .   .   .   .   . Z e i ) p ( , , Z ' l .   .   .   .   . Z,l)--=(3elgzist(e ) Ap'(e . , zI .   .   .   .   . z , , i ) A sentence in English asserts the existence of one or more eventualities in the realworld  , and this may or may not imply the existence of other individuals  . The logical form of sentence ( I ) is
Ezistl E ) Amorshipt(E , JOHN , ZEUS)
This implies ~' zist(JOHN ) but not Ezist(Zbft; , b') . .~imilarly , the logical form of " John wants to fly " is IOns need not adhere to Platonism to accept the Platonic universe  . It ran be viewed a ~ tsocially constituted , or conventional , con . true:ion , which is never ~ hele ~ highly constrained by : he way the  ( not directly accessible material world is . The degree of constraint is variable . We are more constrained by the miteria Jworld to belie ~ in trees and chairs  , le~so to believe in patriotism org hosts . 
i  There ~ der might chaos  #to think ot " the Platonic universeu the univen mofpmmibln individuals  , although 1 do not want to exclude Io~eallll impossible individua/s  , such  - the condition John helio ~ to exist when he believe  ;  6 + 7 -- 15 . 
IM?Cal~hy (1997) employs a simtlar technique.
E = ist(E : )^ w and ( E : , JOHN , El ) Afly '( E  ~ , JOHN ) This implies Ezist JOHN ) but not Ezist ( EI )  . When the existence of the condition corresponding to some predication implies the existence of one of the arguments of the predication  , we will say that the predicate is transparent in that argument  , and opaque otherwise , i Thus , worship and want are transparent in their first arguments and opaque in their secottd arguments  . In general if a predicate p is transparent in its nth argument z  , this can be encoded by the axiom ( re .   .   .   .   .  =,  .   .   . ) p'(e .   .   .   .   .  =,  .   .   . )^Ezi~t(e ) ~ E zist(z)s That is , if e is p's being true of z and e exists , then z exists .

These then imply the existence of Margar et Thatcher MT and President Mitter and PM  , but not the Channel Tunnel CT . Of course , we know about the existence of some of these entities  , such ms Margaret Thatcher and President Mitter and  , for reasons other than the transparency of predicates  . 
Sentence ( 4 ) shows that virtually anything can be embedded in a higher predication  . This is the reason , in the logical not s-tins , for flattening everything into predications about individu- 

There are four serious problems that must be dealt with if this approach is to work-quantifiers  , opaque adverbials , the distinction between dere and dedit to readings of belief reports  , and the problem of identity in intensional contexts  . 
I have described a solution to the quantifier problem elsewhere  ( Hobbs ,  1983) . Briefly , universally quantified variables are reifiedms typical elements of sets  , existential quantification inside the scope of universally quantified variables are handled by means of dependency functions  , and the quantifier structure of sentences i encoded in indices on predicates  . In this paper i will address only the other three problems in detail  . 
3 Opaque Adverbials \[ t seems reasonably natural to treat transparent adverbials as properties of events  . For opaque adverbials , like " almost " , it seem slees natural , and one is inclined to follow Reichenbach ( 1 947 in treating the mmsftmction a is mapping predicates into predicates  . Thus,
John is almost a man .
would here presented almo , t(man)(J )
That is , almos ~ maps the predicate man into the predicate " almostaman '  , which is then applied to John . 
This representation is undesirable for our purpose since it is not first-order  . It would be preferable to treatopaque operators as we do transparent ones  , ms properties of events or conditions . 
The sentence would be represented almost ( E ) Amanl ( E , J )
But does this get as into dil ~ cuity ?
First note that this representation does not imply that John is a man  , for we have not asserted g's existence in the real world  , and almo , tisopaque and does not imply its argument's existence  . 
But is there enough information in E to allow one to determine the truth value of aimomt  ( E ) in isolation ; without appeal to other facts ? The answer is that there could he  . We can construct a model i ~ which for every functional F there is a corresponding equivalent predicate q  , such that ( vp , ~( F ( p ) ( z)--(-3s ) q(~)^p'(e ,  :  )   ) The existence of the model shows that this condition is not necessarily contradictory  . 
Let the , miverse of discourse D be the class of finite sets built out of a finite set of ur elements  . The interpretation of a constant X will be some element of D  ; call it I(X ) . The interpretation of smonsdic predicate p will a subset of D  ; call it lip ) . Then if E is such that p'(E , X ) , we define the interpretation of E to be < l(p ) , \[( X ) > . 
Now suppose we have a functional F mapping predicates into predicates  . We can define the corresponding predicate q to be such that q  ( E ) is true iff there are a predicate p and a constant X where the interpretation of E is < I  ( p )  , \[(X ) > and F ( p ) ( X ) is true . 
The fact that we can define such a predicate q in a moderately rich model means that we are licensed to treat opaque adverbials as properties of events and conditions  . 
The purpose of this exercise is only to show the viability of the approach  . I am not claiming that a running event *8 an ordered pair of the runner and the . set of all runners , although it should he harmless enough for those irrede emably committed to set-theoretic semantics to view it like that  . 
It should be noted that this treatment of adverbials has consequences for the individuating criteria on eventualities  . We can say " John is almost a man ~ without wishing to imply " John is almost a mammal  , " so we would not want to say that John's being a man is the same condition as his being a mammal  . We are forced , though not unwillingly , into a position of individuating eventualities , , , ' cording to very finegrained criteria . 
4 DeRe and DeDic to Belief Reports
The next problem concerns the distinction ( due to Quine ( 19 . 56)) between dere and ded it to belief reports . A belief report like ( 5 ) John believes a man at the next table is a spy . 
has two interpretations . The de die to interpretation is likely in the circumst mace in which John and some man are at adjacent tables and John observe suspicious behavior  . The dereinter . 
pretation is likely if some manissitting at the table next to the speaker of the sentence  , and John is now here around but knows them an otherwise and suspects him to be a spy  . A sentence that very nearly forces the dere reading is John believes Bill's mistress is Bill ' swife / whereas the sentence John believes Russian consula temployees are spies  . 
strongly indicates aded it to reading . In the tiere reading of (5) , John is not necessarily taken to know that the manis in fact at the next table  , but he is normally a . ssumed to be able to identify them an somehow . More on ~ identil'y " below . In the dedivan reading John believes there is a man who is bo that the next table and tspy  , but may be otherwise unable to identify them an . The dere reading of ( 5 ) is usually taken to support the inference ( 6 ) There is someone John believes to be a spy . 
whereas the dedit to reading supports the weaker inference  ( 7 ) John believes that someone is a spy . 
Y Thi- , ~ x " ~ mple is due to Moore and Hendrix (1982) . 

As Quine has pointed out , as usually interpreted , the first of these sentences is false for most of us  , the second one true . A common notational maneuver ( though one that Quine rejects ) is to represent this distinction as a scope ambigafity  . Sentence ( 6 ) is encoded as ( 8 ) and ( 7 ) as ( 9 ) :  ( 8 )   ( ~ z ) believe ( J , spy(z )) (9) believe(J ,   ( 3z ) spy ( z )   ) If one adopts this notation and stipulates what the expressions mean  , then there are certainly distinct ways of representing the two sentences  . But the interpretation of the two expressions is not obvious  . It is not obvious for example that ( 8 ) could not cover the case where there is an individual such that John believes him to be a spy but has never seen him and knows absolutely nothing else about him-no this name  , nor his appearance , nor his location at any point in time-beyond the fact that he is a spy  . 
In fact . the notation we propose takes ( 8 ) to be the most neutral representation . Since quantification is over entities in the Platonic universe  ,   ( 8 ) says that there is some entity in the Platonic universe such that John believes of that  . entity that it is a spy . Expression ( 8 ) commits us to no other beliefs on the part of . John . When understood in this way , expression ( 8 ) is a representation of what is conveyed in a de dit to belief report  . 
Translated into the flat notation and introducing a constant for the existentially quantified variable  . (8) becomes (10) believe J . P ) Aspy ' ( P . S ) Anything else that John believes about this entity must be stated explicitly  . In particular , the de die to reading of ( 5 ) would be represented by something like ( 11 ) believe ( J , P ) Aspy ' ( P , S ) A believe ( J , Q ) Aat '( Q , S , T ) where T is the next table . That is , John believes that S is a spy and that . q is at the next table . John may know many other propcriies about S and still fall short of knowing  , rhothespy is . There is a range of possibilities for John's knowledge  , from the bare statements of ( lO ) and ( It ) that correspond to a , led it to reading to the full-blown knowledge of S ' shh'ntity that is normally present in a dere reading  . In fact , an FBI agent would progress through just such a range of belief states on his way to identifying the spy  . 
To state John's knowledge of S's identity properly  , we wo*tld have to state explicitly John's belief in a potentially very large collection of properties of the spy  . To arrive at a succinct way of representing knowledge of identity in our notation  , letuscon . 
sider the two pairs of equivalent sentences :
What is that ?
Identify that.
The FBI doesn't know who the spy is.
The FBI doesn't know the spy's identity.
The answer to the question " Who are you ?" and what is required before we can say that we know who someone is or that we know their identity is a highly context-dependent matter  . 
Several years ago , before I hadever seen Kripke , if someone had askedme whether Iknew who Saul Kripke was  , I would have said , ~Yes . tle's the author of Naming and Neeessd ~ . The nonce ! was at a workshop which Iknew was being attended by Kripke  , but I didn't yet know what he looked like . If someone had askedme whether Iknew who Kripke was  , I would have had to say , " No . * The relevant property in that context , was not , his authorship of some paper , but any property that distinguished him from the others present  , such as " the malt in the back row holding a cup of coffee *  . 
Knowledge of a person's identity is then a matter of knowing some context-dependent essential property that serves to identify that person for present purposes - that is  , a matter of knowing who he or she is . 
Therefore , we need a kind of placeholder predicate to stand for this essential property  , that in any particular context can be specified more precisely  . It happens that English has a morpheme that serves just this function - the morplwme " wh " Let us then posit a predicate u  , h that stands for the contextually , te-termined property or conjunction of properfes that wotild coiult as an identification in that particular context  . 
The dere reading of ( 5 ) is generally taken to include John's knowledge of the identity of the alh ' d ~ cd spy  . Assuming this , a dere belief report would be represented a . s a conjunction of two beliefs , one for the main predication and the other expressing knowledge of the es ~  , ,ntial properly .

is appropriate , and that is sufficient for the argument . 
It seems then that the toni , net sknow(J . R ) and ~, h'(R . S ) are not part of " #hat we want in the initial logical form of the sentence  , s but only a very common conversational implicature  . The reason the implicature is very . common is that if iAn other way of putting it : they are not part  . of the literal meaning of the sentenc ; e . 

John doesn't know that the man is at the next table  , there must be some other description under which John is familiar with the man  . The story I just told provide such a description , but not one sufficient for identifying them an . 
This analysis is attractive since it allows us to view the dere-de dicto distinction problem u just one instance of a much more general problem  , namely , the existential status of the grammatically subordinated material in sentences  . Generally , such material takes on the tense of the sentence . Thus , in
The boy built the boat.
a building event by z of y takes place in the past  , and we assume that a was a boy in the past , at the time of the building . But in Many rich men studied computer science in college  . 
the most natural reading is not that themen were rich when they were studying computer science but that they are rich now  . In
The flower is artificial.
there is an entity z which is described as a flower  , and zexists , but its " flower-hess " does not exist in the real world  . Rather , it is a condition which is embedded in the opaque predicate " artificial '  . 
It was stated above that the representation ( 10 ) for the dedit to reading conveys no properties of So ther than that John believes him to be aspy  . In particular , it does not convey S's existence in the real world  . Sthus refers to a possible individual , who may turn out to be , wtual if , for example , Johnever comes to be able to identify the person whom he believes to be the spy  , or if there is some actual spy who has given John good cause for his suspicions  . 
However , S may not be actual , only possible . Suppose this is the case . One common objection to possible individuals is that they may seem to violate the Law of the Excluded Middle  . IsS married or not married ? Our intuition is that the question is inappropriate  , and indeed the answer given in our formalism has this flavor  . By axiom (3) , married ( S ) is really just an abbreviation for married ' ( g , S )^ gzist(E ) . This is false , for the existence of E in the real world would imply the existence of S  . 
So married ( S ) is also false . But its falsity has nothing to do with S's marital status  , only his existential status . The predication unmarried ( S ) is false for the same reason . The primed predicates are basic , and for them the problem of the excluded middle does not arise  . The predication maeried '( E , S ) is true or false depending on whether E is the condition of S's being married  . An unprimed , trmxs parent predicate carries along with it the existence of its arguments  , and it can fail to be true of an entity either through the entity being actual but not having that property or through the nonexistence of the entity  . 
5 Identity in Belief Contexts
The final problem I will consider arises in de die to belief reports  . 
It is the problem of identity in intensional contexts  , raised by grege (1892) . One way of stating the problem is this . Why is it that if ( 14 ) John believes the Evening Starisrising . 
and if the Evening Star is identical to the Morning Star  , it is not necessarily true that ( 15 ) John believes the Morning Starisrising . 
By Leibniz's Law , we ought to be able to substitute for an entity any entity that is identical to it  . 
This puzzle survives translation into the logical notation  , if John knows of the existence of the Morning Star and if proper names are unique  . The representation for ( the de dicto reading of ) sentence ( 14 ) is ( 16 ) believe ( J , P , ) Arise : ( FI , ES ) A believe(J , Qt )
A Even in pStar:(QI , ES)
John's belief in the Morning Star would he represented believe  ( J , Q2) A Morning . Star:(Q2 , MS ) The existence of the Evening Star and the Moromg Star is expressed by 
Ezist(Qi)^E zist(Q2)
The uniqueness of the proper name " Evening Star " is expressed by the axiom  ( V z , y ) Even in ?- Star(z ) A Evensn?-Star(y)D . z = y The identity of the Evening Star and the Morning Star is expressed  ( V  ~ ) Eoening- , ~ ; lar ( ~ ) - - - - A forning - b ' tar ( z ) From all of this we can infer that the Morning Star M  , q is also an Evening Star and hence is identical to ES  ;  , and hence can be substituted into ri . se'(Pi , E . S ') to giverise '( PI , MS) . Then we have believe ( J , P , ) Avine '( P , , M S ) A believe ( J , Q : )
A Morning-b'tar'(Q:,MS)
This is a representation fortile paradoxical sentence  ( 15 )  . 
There are three possibilities for dealing with this proi  ) lem . 
The first is to discard or restrict I , eibniz's Law . The second is to deny that the Evening ~ tar and the Morning Star are identical a  . sentities in the Platonic universe ; they only happen to he identical in the real world  , and that is not sullieient for intersubstitutivity The third is to deny that expression  ( 16 ) represents ~ entence ( 14 ) because " the Evening Star " in ( 14 ) does not refer to what it seems to refer to . 
The first possibility is the approach of researchers who treat belief as an operator rather than as a predicate  , and then re . 
strict substitution inside the operator . ~ We cannot avail ourselves of this . solution bec . a use of the flatness of our notation . 
The predicaterts e is surely referentially transparent  , so if ES and MS are identical , M , S " can he substituted for E : S in the expression rine '  ( l'l , Eb ') to giverts e '( l'\] . M . S ') . Then the expression belier , e(J , I '1 ) wouhl not even require substitution to hea belief about the Morning Star  . 
In any case , this approach does not seemwise in view of the central importance played ia discourse interpretation by the identity of differently presented entities  , i . e . by coreference . Free intersubstitutibility of identical seems a desirable property to preser'se  . 
The second possible answer to Frege's problem is to say that in the Platonic universe  , the Morning Star and the Evening Star * Thisiaa purely syntactic approach  , and whPn one tries to construct ? semantics for it  , one is generally driven to the third possibility . 
86 are different entities . It just happens chu in the res/world they are idemical  . But it is not true that E$=MS , for equality , like quantification , is overentities in the Platonic universe . The fact that E , . ~ and M Sate identical in the realwodd ( call this relation rw-identicai ) must be stated explicitly , say , by the expression r ~- identical ( ES , MS ) or more properly ,  (~: , ~t ) Moming-Star (:) A Euen in ~ . Stav(y)
Dr ~.4 dcntical(z , If)
For reuon in ~ shout " r ~- idmtical " entities , thm ~ is , Platonic entities th~mrs identical in the real world  , we may cake the fol-Iow in ~ approach- Substitution in re  ( erenm dly tr sms parent contexts wo nld be , z : hieved by ~ soo ( the sx/om schema (17) ( Vel , es . e4 . . . . ) p/(et . . . . . ? s . . . . ) A rw . idsnticed(e4, eS)D (:: leZ)p~(ez . . . . . e4, . . . ) Ar~n . 4 dsnfica ~ ( ez , e ! ) where es is the/cth argument of psadp is referentially cras ~  , parent in imkthar ~ ment .

Substitution o /' h'w . identicab " ins condition resulra not in the same condition but in  , n " rw-identical " condition .

This solution is in the spirit of our whole representational ~ p  . 
preach in ch * ~ it forcestm cobepaln ( ully expticit about every . 
chm ~ . The notation does no magic for us . There is as it , nificant cost a ~ . socis:ed with th ~ solution , however . When proper names ? rere presented upredicates adnotuconstants  , the natural way cost ate the uniqueness o ( proper names is by mesaso ( axioms of the foiiow in ? sort : ( ~= , y ) Euen , ng*~tar ( z ) A " ~ uensng-Star ( g ) DZIyBUt since from ~ hesX/oms for r ~ -identieai we can show chat " ~ veninf-~tar  ( ~ fS )  , it would followch scM ~= ~ S . We mnst thus restate the axiom for \[ he umquenesso  ( proper uames a = ( V = , y ) Even in ~ . Star (=)^ Even inf-Star(v ) 3r ~ . ident , cal(z , ~) A similar modification mus , be made for functions . Since we are using only predicates , the uniqueness of the value of a function must be encoded with an axiom like  ( ?= , V , :) father ( = , z ) ^ father v , z ) ~== yIf = and y are both fathemo / " z , henz and y are the same . This wonld have to be replaced by the axiom ( V = , y , z ) father ( = , :)^ father(y , z ) 3 rw-identicai ( = , V ) The very common problems involving ressom nK shout equality  , which can be done el Rciently , are thus translated into problems involvinf resmnm~shout the predicate re  . identical , which is very cumber some . 
One way to view Ch/s second solution is ~ al~x co the first so-lucian  . For "=*" we substitute the relation r ~;- q den ~ , cad , ~ md by means of axiom schema (17) , we force substitutions copropagate to the eventualities they occur in  , and we force the distinction between referentially transparent and referentially opaque predicates to be made explicitly  . It is thus an indirect way of rejecting
L , eibnis ' Law.
The third solution is to say that " the Even in f Star * in sen-tents  ( 14 ) does not really refer to the Evening Star , but cosome abstract entity somehow related to the Even in ~ Star  . That is . 
sentence (14) is re-flyen example of metonymy . This may seem counterintuitive , sad even bizar re , at first blush . But in fact the most widely * , ' espied clmmical solutions to the problem of identiwate of thn  , flavor . Foe Fre~e ( 1892 ) " the Evening Star ~ in sentence ( 14 ) does no * refer cothe Even in ~ Starbut cothe tenme of the phrsac " the Evening Star ~  . \[ namore recent ap-proar . h , Zalta ( 1983 ) ts~es such noun phrases corefer co " ab-strict objects " related to the res J object  . In both approaches noun phrues in intemional context ~ refer cosenses or abstract objects  , while other noun phrues refer coactual entities , sad so it is necessary cospecify which predicates are intensioa *  , l . \[ na Mantaavian approach , " the Evening Star " would be taken to refer co the inter  . on o ( the Evening Star , not its e = te ~* on in the real world , sad noun phrases would al , vays be taken corefer cointensions , -It hough for nonintensional predicates there would be mesmng postulates chat make this equivalent coreference coextensions  . 
Thus , in all these approaches intentional and extensional predicates must be distint mished explicitly  , sad noun phrs~s in intensional contexts are systematically interpreted metonymically  . 
It would beem , yenouch in our framework coimplement these q3proaches   . Wec , m define a function ao ( three arguments - the actual entity , the co , niter , sad the condition used codescribe the entity- chat returns the sense  , or intention , or abstract entity , corresponding cothe + ctual entity for chat ? ognizer ~ nd that condition  . Sentence (14) would be represented , not ~(16) .

The dif~culty with this approach is that it makes the interpee-ration o /" noun phrases dependent on their embedding context : \[ ntension ai context-*me?onym lcinter pretation Extensional context--noumetonymic interpretation It thus violates  , though not sorious iy , the nmve com ~ tionaiity that \[ have been at so many pehm to preserve  .
