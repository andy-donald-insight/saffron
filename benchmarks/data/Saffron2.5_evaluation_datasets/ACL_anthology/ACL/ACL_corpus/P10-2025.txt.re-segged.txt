Abstract
We present a novel framework for word alignment that incorporates synonym knowledge collected from monolingual linguistic resources in a bilingual probabilistic model . Synonym information is helpful for word alignment because we can expect a synonym to correspond to the same word in a different language.
We design a generative model for word alignment that uses synonym information as a regularization term . The experimental results show that our proposed method significantly improves word alignment quality.
1 Introduction
Word alignment is an essential step in most phrase and syntax based statistical machine translation ( SMT ). It is an inference problem of word correspondences between different languages given parallel sentence pairs . Accurate word alignment can induce high quality phrase detection and translation probability , which leads to a significant improvement in SMT performance . Many word alignment approaches based on generative models have been proposed and they learn from bilingual sentences in an unsupervised manner ( Vogel et al , 1996; Och and Ney , 2003; Fraser and
Marcu , 2007).
One way to improve word alignment quality is to add linguistic knowledge derived from a monolingual corpus . This monolingual knowledge makes it easier to determine corresponding words correctly . For instance , functional words in one language tend to correspond to functional words in another language ( Deng and Gao , 2007), and the syntactic dependency of words in each language can help the alignment process ( Ma et al , 2008). It has been shown that such grammatical information works as a constraint in word alignment models and improves word alignment quality.
A large number of monolingual lexical semantic resources such as WordNet ( Miller , 1995) have been constructed in more than fifty languages ( Sagot and Fiser , 2008). They include word-level relations such as synonyms , hypernyms and hyponyms . Synonym information is particularly helpful for word alignment because we can expect a synonym to correspond to the same word in a different language . In this paper , we explore a method for using synonym information effectively to improve word alignment quality.
In general , synonym relations are defined in terms of word sense , not in terms of word form . In other words , synonym relations are usually context or domain dependent . For instance , ? head ? and ? chief ? are synonyms in contexts referring to working environment , while ? head ? and ? forefront ? are synonyms in contexts referring to physical positions . It is difficult , however , to imagine a context where ? chief ? and ? forefront ? are synonyms.
Therefore , it is easy to imagine that simply replacing all occurrences of ? chief ? and ? forefront ? with ? head ? do sometimes harm with word alignment accuracy , and we have to model either the context or senses of words.
We propose a novel method that incorporates synonyms from monolingual resources in a bilingual word alignment model . We formulate a synonym pair generative model with a topic variable and use this model as a regularization term with a bilingual word alignment model . The topic variable in our synonym model is helpful for disambiguating the meanings of synonyms . We extend HM-BiTAM , which is a HMM-based word alignment model with a latent topic , with a novel synonym pair generative model . We applied the proposed method to an English-French word alignment task and successfully improved the word alignment quality.
2 Bilingual Word Alignment Model
In this section , we review a conventional generative word alignment model , HM-BiTAM ( Zhao and Xing , 2008).
HM-BiTAM is a bilingual generative model with topic z , alignment a and topic weight vector ? as latent variables . Topic variables such as ? science ? or ? economy ? assigned to individual sentences help to disambiguate the meanings of words . HM-BiTAM assumes that the nth bilingual sentence pair , ( En , Fn ), is generated under a given latent topic zn ? {1, . . . , k , . . . , K }, where K is the number of latent topics . Let N be the number of sentence pairs , and In and Jn be the lengths of En and Fn , respectively . In this framework , all of the bilingual sentence pairs { E,F } = {( En , Fn)}Nn=1 are generated as follows.
1. ? ? Dirichlet (?): sample topic-weight vector 2. For each sentence pair ( En , Fn ) ( a ) zn ? Multinomial (?): sample the topic ( b ) en,i:In | zn ? p ( En | zn ;? ): sample English words from a monolingual unigram model given topic zn ( c ) For each position jn = 1, . . . , Jn i . ajn ? p ( ajn | ajn?1;T ): sample an alignment link ajn from a first order Markov process ii . fjn ? p ( fjn | En , ajn , zn;B ): sample a target word fjn given an aligned source word and topic where alignment ajn = i denotes source word ei and target word fjn are aligned . ? is a parameter over the topic weight vector ?, ? = {? k,e } is the source word probability given the kth topic : p ( e | z = k ). B = { Bf,e,k } represents the word translation probability from e to f under the kth topic : p ( f | e , z = k ). T = {
Ti,i ? } is a state transition probability of a first order Markov process.
Fig . 1 shows a graphical model of HM-BiTAM.
The total likelihood of bilingual sentence pairs { E,F } can be obtained by marginalizing out latent variables z , a and ?, p ( F,E ; ?) = ? z ? a  p ( F,E , z , a , ?; ?) d ?, (1) where ? = {?, ?, T,B } is a parameter set . In this model , we can infer word alignment a by maximizing the likelihood above.
3 Proposed Method 3.1 Synonym Pair Generative Model We design a generative model for synonym pairs { f , f ?} in language F , which assumes that the synonyms are collected from monolingual linguistic resources . We assume that each synonym pair ( f , f ?) is generated independently given the same ? sense ? s . Under this assumption , the probability of synonym pair ( f , f ?) can be formulated as , p ( f , f ? ) ? ? s p ( f | s ) p ( f ? | s ) p ( s ) . (2) We define a pair ( e , k ) as a representation of the sense s , where e and k are a word in a different language E and a latent topic , respectively.
It has been shown that a word e in a different language is an appropriate representation of s in synonym modeling ( Bannard and Callison-Burch , 2005). We assume that adding a latent topic k for the sense is very useful for disambiguating word meaning , and thus that ( e , k ) gives us a good approximation of s . Under this assumption , the synonym pair generative model can be defined as follows.
p ( { f , f ? } ; ?? ) ? ? ( f,f ?) ? e,k p(f | e , k ; ??) p(f ?| e , k ; ??) p(e , k ; ??),(3) where ?? is the parameter set of our model.
3.2 Word Alignment with Synonym
Regularization
In this section , we extend the bilingual generative model ( HM-BiTAM ) with our synonym pair model . Our expectation is that synonym pairs erative process correspond to the same word in a different language , thus they make it easy to infer accurate word alignment . HM-BiTAM and the synonym model share parameters in order to incorporate monolingual synonym information into the bilingual word alignment model . This can be achieved via reparameterizing ?? in eq . 3 as , p ( f ? ? ? e , k ; ?? ) ? p ( f | e , k;B ) , (4) p ( e , k ; ?? ) ? p ( e | k ;? ) p ( k ;?) . (5) Overall , we redefine the synonym pair model with the HM-BiTAM parameter set ?, p ( { f , f ? } ; ?) ? 1? k ? ? k ? ? ( f,f ?) ? k,e ? k?k,eBf,e,kBf ?, e,k . (6) Fig . 2 shows a graphical model of the synonym pair generative process . We estimate the parameter values to maximize the likelihood of HM-BiTAM with respect to bilingual sentences and that of the synonym model with respect to synonym pairs collected from monolingual resources.
Namely , the parameter estimate , ??, is computed as ?? = argmax ? { log p(F,E ; ?) + ? log p ( { f , f ? } ; ?) } , (7) where ? is a regularization weight that should be set for training . We can expect that the second term of eq . 7 to constrain parameter set ? and avoid overfitting for the bilingual word alignment model . We resort to the variational EM approach ( Bernardo et al , 2003) to infer ?? following HM-BiTAM . We omit the parameter update equation due to lack of space.
4 Experiments 4.1 Experimental Setting
For an empirical evaluation of the proposed method , we used a bilingual parallel corpus of English-French Hansards ( Mihalcea and Pedersen , 2003). The corpus consists of over 1 million sentence pairs , which include 447 manually wordaligned sentences . We selected 100 sentence pairs randomly from the manually wordaligned sentences as development data for tuning the regularization weight ?, and used the 347 remaining sentence pairs as evaluation data . We also randomly selected 10k , 50k , and 100k sized sentence pairs from the corpus as additional training data.
We ran the unsupervised training of our proposed word alignment model on the additional training data and the 347 sentence pairs of the evaluation data . Note that manual word alignment of the 347 sentence pairs was not used for the unsupervised training . After the unsupervised training , we evaluated the word alignment performance of our proposed method by comparing the manual word alignment of the 347 sentence pairs with the prediction provided by the trained model.
We collected English and French synonym pairs from WordNet 2.1 ( Miller , 1995) and WOLF 0.1.4 ( Sagot and Fiser , 2008), respectively . WOLF is a semantic resource constructed from the Princeton WordNet and various multilingual resources . We selected synonym pairs where both words were included in the bilingual training set.
We compared the word alignment performance of our model with that of GIZA ++ 1.03 1 ( Vogel et al , 1996; Och and Ney , 2003), and HM-BiTAM ( Zhao and Xing , 2008) implemented by us . GIZA ++ is an implementation of IBMmodel 4 and HMM , and HM-BiTAM corresponds to ? = 0 in eq . 7. We adopted K = 3 topics , following the setting in ( Zhao and Xing , 2006).
We trained the word alignment in two directions : English to French , and French to English.
The alignment results for both directions were refined with ? GROW ? heuristics to yield high precision and high recall in accordance with previous work ( Och and Ney , 2003; Zhao and Xing , 2006).
We evaluated these results for precision , recall , Fmeasure and alignment error rate ( AER ), which are standard metrics for word alignment accuracy ( Och and Ney , 2000).

4.2 Results and Discussion
Table 1 shows the word alignment accuracy of the three methods trained with 10k , 50k , and 100k additional sentence pairs . For all settings , our proposed method outperformed other conventional methods . This result shows that synonym information is effective for improving word alignment quality as we expected.
As mentioned in Sections 1 and 3.1, the main idea of our proposed method is to introduce latent topics for modeling synonym pairs , and then to utilize the synonym pair model for the regularization of word alignment models . We expect the latent topics to be useful for modeling polysemous words included in synonym pairs and to enable us to incorporate synonym information effectively into word alignment models . To confirm the effect of the synonym pair model with latent topics , we also tested GIZA ++ and HM-BiTAM with what we call Synonym Replacement Heuristics ( SRH ), where all of the synonym pairs in the bilingual training sentences were simply replaced with a representative word . For instance , the words ? sick ? and ? ill ? in the bilingual sentences # vocabularies 10k 50k 100k
English standard 8578 16924 22817 with SRH 5435 7235 13978

were replaced with the word ? sick ?. As shown in Table 2, the number of vocabularies in the English and French data sets decreased as a result of employing the SRH.
We show the performance of GIZA ++ and HM-BiTAM with the SRH in the lines entitled ? with SRH ? in Table 1. The GIZA ++ and HM-BiTAM with the SRH slightly outperformed the standard GIZA ++ and HM-BiTAM for the 10k and 100k data sets , but underperformed with the 50k data set . We assume that the SRH mitigated the overfitting of these models into low-frequency word pairs in bilingual sentences , and then improved the word alignment performance . The SRH regards all of the different words coupled with the same word in the synonym pairs as synonyms . For instance , the words ? head ?, ? chief ? and ? forefront ? in the bilingual sentences are replaced with ? chief ?, since (? head ?, ? chief ?) and (? head ?, ? forefront ?) are synonyms . Obviously , (? chief ?, ? forefront ?) are not synonyms , which is detrimented to word alignment.
The proposed method consistently outperformed GIZA ++ and HM-BiTAM with the SRH in 10k , 50k and 100k data sets in Fmeasure.
The synonym pair model in our proposed method can automatically learn that (? head ?, ? chief ?) and (? head ?, ? forefront ?) are individual synonyms with different meanings by assigning these pairs to different topics . By sharing latent topics between the synonym pair model and the word alignment model , the synonym information incorporated in the synonym pair model is used directly for training word alignment model . The experimental results show that our proposed method was effective in improving the performance of the word alignment model by using synonym pairs including such ambiguous synonym words.
Finally , we discuss the data set size used for unsupervised training . As shown in Table 1, using a large number of additional sentence pairs improved the performance of all the models . In all our experimental settings , all the additional sen-from the Hansards data set . These experimental results show that a larger number of sentence pairs was more effective in improving word alignment performance when the sentence pairs were collected from a homogeneous data source . However , in practice , it might be difficult to collect a large number of such homogeneous sentence pairs for a specific target domain and language pair . One direction for future work is to confirm the effect of the proposed method when training the word alignment model by using a large number of sentence pairs collected from various data sources including many topics for a specific language pair.
5 Conclusions and Future Work
We proposed a novel framework that incorporates synonyms from monolingual linguistic resources in a word alignment generative model.
This approach utilizes both bilingual and monolingual synonym resources effectively for word alignment . Our proposed method uses a latent topic for bilingual sentences and monolingual synonym pairs , which is helpful in terms of word sense disambiguation . Our proposed method improved word alignment quality with both small and large data sets . Future work will involve examining the proposed method for different language pairs such as EnglishChinese and English-Japanese and evaluating the impact of our proposed method on SMT performance . We will also apply our proposed method to a larger data sets of multiple domains since we can expect a further improvement in word alignment accuracy if we use more bilingual sentences and more monolingual knowledge.
