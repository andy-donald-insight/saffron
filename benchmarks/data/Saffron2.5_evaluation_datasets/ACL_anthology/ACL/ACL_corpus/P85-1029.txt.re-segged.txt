Abstract
It is widely recognized that a question-answer lng system should be able to tailor its answers to the user  . 
One of the dimensions Mong which thus tailoring can occur is with respect to the level of knowledge of a user about a domain  . In particular , responses should be different depending on whether they are addressed to ns/ve or expert users  . To understand what those differences should be , we a ~ alyzed texts from a dult and i unior encyclopedias  . We found that two different strategies were used in describing complex physical obiects to juniors and adults  . We show how these strategies have been implemented on a test database  . 

Whether the purpose of a natural language program Ls to ease man-machine interactions \ [ Kaplan  82  ; Hayes and Reddy 79\] or to model human communication ~ Lehnert 781  , it must take into conslder ~ tion certain characteristics of the person engaged in the interaction  . 
\[ nan interaction between people , the goals , beliefs , retentions , knowledge and past experience of the participants will play a role in how they communicate with each other\[Cohen and Perrault  791  , \ [ Perrault and Allen 80\ [ . Similarly , those characteristics should play a role in the way a computer system interacts with a user  . In particular , a quest lon-answering program that provides access to a large amount of data to many different users will be most useful if it can tailor its answers to each user  . 
We are interested here in how the level of knowledge  ( or expertise ) of the user a ~ fects an answer . 
As an example of this kind of tailoring in a naturally occurring conversation  , an explanation of how a car engine works a~meda ~ ~ child wdl be different than one ~ med ~ ttan adult  , and an explanation adequate for a music student is probably not quite sufficient for a student in mechanic ~ lengineering  . \[ n this paper , we study the strategies used tn natural language to describe physical objects to two different types of users : naive and expert  . By naive ~ nd expert , we refer to how familiar a userm about the domain of the database as opposed to how experienced the user is with the question /a Jnswering system  . When the databasets complex , it becomes important to vary the level and the kind of details included in the answer in order to provide an answer that caabe best understood by the user  . 
We plan to use this distinction in the question -answering program for RESEARCHER  , a system being developed at Columbia University . RESEARCHER reads , remembers , and generalizes from patents abstracts written in English \[ Lebowitz  83\]  . The abstracts descrl be complex physical objects in which spatial and functional relations are important  . Thus , we are interested in characterizing spatial strategies that can be used for experts and novices about certmnphysical obiects  . We give deta41s in the paper of the current implementation of description strategies on a test database of object descriptions  . 
OURDOMAIN
Our goal is to characterize some of the strategies employed to describe complex physical objects and see whether these strategles are different for naive and experts users  . To investigate thus problem , we have looked at texts from encyclopedias botih adult and junior  ) and high school physics textbooks ~ . The texts we have studied are about physlc~l objects performing a function  ( such as telephoues and telescopes )  , and generally do not exceed several paragraphs in length  . 
These texts make the distinction between na4ve and expert readers ~ nd have been widely used for a number of years for those audiences  . They provide examples of different descriptive strategies that actually occur in natural language  . Thus , a question-answering system should be able to reproduce them -'  . 
Studying texts from encyclopedias gives us the advantage of being able to compare descriptions of identical objects aimed at two distinct audiences  . On the average , a younger audience has had less opportunity to gather experience and knowledge about any  . particular doma4n . Thus a younger audience as a-whole is more naive about ~ domain than an adult audience  . Hence , these texts give us a good starting point for studying the differences between the IW estudied about fifteen examples from each encyclopedia and textbook  . 
2 Our goal however , is not to study , how effective these tex~s ~ refor different human rea  ( iers . If further psychologlcal research shows that other distinctions ~  . re?p propriate , they could be . incorpoTated . .  . The dustinction based on encyclppedias and textbooks is ? really the only available at thls point  .

THETEXTUAL ANALYSIS
We began by analyzing the different texts using methods developed by other researchers  ( \[ Hobbs 78 a )  , \[ Hobbs 80 l , \[ Mann84\] , \[ McKeown82\] ) we decomposed paragraphs in terms of their pmmit werhetorical structure ia an attempt to find a consistent structure tn each group of texts  . The analy . ~s showed the adultency clopedia descriptions to be mainlym terms of the subparts of the object being descrlbed These texts can be characterized by one of the textual structures posited tn\[  McKe0wn   82\]  , the constituency schema . This structure is presented m the next section . On the other hand , no schema or other organizing structure consistently accounted for the descrlpt mnsm the junior encyclopedia texts In looking for other types of organizing srrategles  , we discovered that the ma~n strategym descrlbmg cblects to a naive user is to trace through the process that allows the obiect to perform Lts function  . 
Strategy for the Adults
The descriptions from the adultency clopedias tend to follow the pattern estabhs hed by the constltuency schema  , one of the textual structures defined m\[ McKeown  82\[  . In her work on natural language generation , McKeown studied the problems of what to say and how to organize text coherently  . She examined texts and transcripts , classifying_each sentence as one of a set of rhetorical predicates  3 and found that some comblnatmns of predicates were more likely  , to occur than others . Moreover . for each discourse sltuation , some combination would be the most appropriate one  . Those standard combinations were encoded as schemas which axe associated wlth a particular dLs course situation  . One of these schemas is the constltuency schema which is used to descrl be an object  ( or concept ) m terms of its subparts and their properties . The constituency schema is shown below ~ ( For a given entity , Constituency LS the description of its subparts or subtypes  , and the attributive predicate glees properties associated with it  . )  3Rhetorical predicates characterlze the structural purpose of a sentence and have been discussed b ~" avamety of linguists \[ Grimes  75\] f Hobbs 78b    S6me examples are constituency ( describtlon of subparts or subtypes )  , attributive ( providing detadabout an entity or event ) and analafy ( -the making of an analogy )  . 
4We have altered McKeown's constituency schema slightly by making the first predicate option k l Instead  . 
of mandatory : in the texts studied , the main part so the object were not necessarily immediately lis~ed  . We , ~ , e using McKeown's notation : "" mdicat d optlonality  , ' p indicates alternatives , "?" indicates that the item may appear 1n times , and "* ~ indicates that the item may appear 0-n times . Finally ,  " ; " is used to represent clsz sificatlon of ambiguous propositions  .

Other differences occurred between the jumor and adult entries as well  . In general , more vlsual tn formatlon was included m the text for the junior  , so as to render the description more v l v l d . For example , the carbon button in the telephone descnptlonIs described as " a ! ittle brass box filled wlth carbon of especlally selected and treated coal " m the junior  8This excerpt is taken from an adultency clopedia . 
encyclopedia , in contrast to " the carbon chamber contains granules " m the adultency clopedia  , similarly , the junior entry for light bulbs describes a filament as a " fine run  . ten filament wound mvery small coils " , whereas the adultency clopedi~ment lons only " ~ coded tungs ten filament  . " Another malor difference was that the lumor encyciopedi ~ texts had a higher degree of redundancy while the adultency clopedia ones were quite concise We refer to the jumor telephone example again to illustrate this point : sentences $ and  6 explained how the electncltyIsmade to flow easily through the box Sentence  7 xs are capt tulatlon of that phenomenon . 
Finally , sentence 8 explains the reverse effect Finally , we observed that expository style and vocabulary differed considerably m the two types of texts studied  . Future research will attempt to characterize these phenomena  .

For the junior , the strategy dictates to fol ! ow the cause-effects links in the knowledgeb ~ se  , norder t , ot race the process .

The program traces through the meta-relatlons , ptcklnK the process informatlon as shown m Fisure  4  . When . ~ relatlon can be broken into substeps , the program then traces through those substeps ( see Figure S )  . 
Future Work
The reaxese verM theoretic Mmsues that need to be addressed  . In our test dat ~ ba . s e , the problem of declding m what order relations occur does not arise  . 
However , for an arbitrary database , knowmg where to begs describing a process may be more difficult Simllaxly  , the process may not be as sequential ~ s the ones we examined so fax  , and , as a result , we plan on further study of how to organize the informa Uon  . 
Furthermore , in our test database , we don't need tcconszder how deep into the substeps the process description should go  , but this Issue exists for an arbitraxy database . Finally , we have looked at the two ends of a spectrum ( n~ve and expert )  , but , for users not at either of these ends , we must consider how to combine these strategies . 

We have started to address the problem of generating natural language for the descriptions  . We have begun the augmentation of an English surface generator \] McKeown  82\] that , using ? functional grammar\[Kay 79\] , takes the output of the textual component to translate it into English sentences "'  . 
However , how this program may interface with the strategies remains to be studied  . 

It is important to tailor a system's response to the level of expert me of the user  . By studying texts aimed at two different levels of readers  , we have found that two different strategies were used in describing physical objects  , depending on whether the description was for an a dultor for a junior  . For an adult , an object is described with its subparts and their properties  ; for a junior , the description traces through the mechanical process which renders the object functional  . 
The two strategies presented account for them are differences found between the adult and jumor entries  . 
This turns out not to consist of merelyglving more details for the expert ~ m often thought \ [ Wallis and Shortliffe  82\]  . \[ n the adult entries , details given a remainly about the subparts and the lr properties and less about the mechanical process involved  . When the process mechanism is mentioned at all , it is done very briefly . In the iumor entries , process mechanismm more important than subparts and given in more detail  . Parts are introduced either alter or at the same time as their function is defined  , and , as a consequence , are always defined when presented . 
Furthermore , since the process mechanism follows every step of the causal chain  , descriptions for the novice tend to include more detail about functional reformation than descriptions for the expert  . We have shown how formalization of the strategies allows for the development of question-answering systems which can tailor their responses to the user  , given his level of expertise about the domaml2
