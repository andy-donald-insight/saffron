1. Introduction
To resolve or not to resolve , that is the structural ambiguity dilemma . The traditional wisdom is to disambiguate only when it matters in terms of the meaning of the utterance  , and to do so using the computationally least costly information  . 
NLP work on PP-attachment has followed this wisdom  , and much effort has been focused on formulating structural and lexical strategies for resolving noun phrase and verb phrase  ( NP PP vs . VP PP ) attachment ambiguity ( e . g .  \[8, 11\]) . In one study , statistical analysis of the distribution of lexical items in a very large text yielded  78% correct parses while two humans achieved just 85%\[5\]  . The close performance of machine and humanled the authors to pose two issues that will be addressed in this paper : is the predictive power of distributional data due to " a complementation relation  , a modification relation , or something else " , and what characterizes the attachment shatescape prediction ?  2  . Pragmatically ambiguous PPs Although structural and lexical rules alone do not suffice to disambiguate all kinds of PPs  , discourse modelling is viewed as computationally costly  ( cf .  \[1\]) . The debate over resolution strategies i not simply about practicality  , but rather , at stake is the notion of what exactly it means for a PP to attach  . This paper defends discourse-level strategies by arguing that a certain PP-attachment ambiguity  , sentential vs . verb phrase ( SPP vs . VP PP ) , reflects a third kind of relation that is pragmatic in nature  . As noted in \[11\] , context-dependent preferences cannot be computed a priori  , so pragmatic PP-attachment ambiguities are among those that defy structural and lexical rules for disambiguation  . 
Another criticism aimed at discourse-level approaches i that pragmatic ambiguities can be left unresolved because they do not affect the meaning of an utterance  . In the case of S-PPs and VP-PPs , however , the linguistic evidence points to significant meaning differences  ( section 3 )  . This paper offers a unified account of the linguistic behavior of these PPs which is expressed in a new formalism  ( section 4 )  , and concludes that the resolution of pragmatic PP -attachment ambiguity is necessary for language understanding  ( section 5 )  . 
3 . The need to disambiguate 3 . 1 L inguist ic ev idence Linguists have identified instrumental  , locative and temporal adverbial PPs as the most structurally unrestricted  , context-dependent types of PPs\[6 ,  10\] . These kinds of PPs often can attach either to S or VP  . Thus , Warrensang in the park can be paraphrased as either Where Warrensang was in the park or What Warren did in the park wassing  . Kunoar gues that the former interpretation i volves a place-identifying VP PP  , and the latter ascene-setting SPP . Also , the following meaning differences occur : given -new/theme-rheme S-PPs are given/themes  , VP-
PPs are new/themes.
preposability S-PPs can be preposed , preposed VP-PPs soundawkward and often change meaning  . 
3 51 entailments SPP utterances have no entailments of the utterance without the PP  . For VP-PPs , the utterance without the PP is entailed only if the utterance is affirmative  . 
negation S-PPs always lie outside the scope of negation  , VP-PPs may or may not lie inside the scope of negation  . 
These aspects of meaning cannot be dismissed as spurious  . 
Consider Kuno's pair of sentences : ? Jim didn't visit museums in Paris  , but he did in London(1) . 
? Jim didn't visit museums in Paris : he visited museums in London  ( 2 )  . 
Kuno assigns ( 1 ) the interpretation i which ' the PPs are sential nd two events are described : although Jim visited museums only in London  , he also went to Paris . Sentence ( 2 ) is assigned the reading that Jim was not in Paris at all but went only to London where he visited museums  . The PPs are verb-phrasalnd only one event is being talked about  . 
3.2 A pragmatic relation
The behavior of these adverbial PPs reflects neither a complementation or a modification relation  . If attachment is dictated by complementation , an instrumental PP should always appear as an argument of the verb predicate in logical form  . But this sacrifices entailments for affirmative VP PP utterances  ; ' butter ( to as t , knife ) ' does not logically entail'but-ter ( to as t ) ' \[2 ,  3\] . If construed as a modification relation , attachment is redundant with phrase structure information and curiously depends on whether the subject  , or any other constituent outside the VP , is or is not modified by the PP . There may well be reasons to preserve these relations in the syrt-tactic structure  , but they axe not the relations that desribd the behavior of pragmatically ambiguous PPs  . 
The linguistic evidence suggests that the SPP vs . VPPP distinction reflects a pragmatic relation , namely a discourse entity specification relation where specify means to refer in a model  \[4\]  . Since this relation cannot be represented by traditional phrase structure trees  , the meaning differences that distinguish the two kinds of PPs must be captured by a different formal structure  . The proposed event formalism treats utterances with adverbial PPs as descriptions of events and is adapted from Davidson's logical form for action sentences  \[2\] using restricted quantification . 
4 . A unified formal account 4 . 1 Event representat ions Davidson's logical form consists of an existentially quantified event entity variable and predication  , as in (3c ) ( Agt ( Jones , e)AAct(butter , e)AObj ( toast , e)AInstr(knife , e )) for Jones buttered the to as t with the knife . Davids on assigns equal status to all modifiers , thereby allowing events , like objects and people , to be described by any combination of their properties  . This flattening of the argument structure clears the way for using restricted quantification to ' elevate ' some predicates to event-specifying status  . Following\[12\] , the structure 3eP restricts the range of e to those entities that satisfy P  , an arbitrarily complex predicate of the form AuP ~ ( zl , tt ) ^ . . . ^P , , , ( z , n , n) . In expressions of the form (3e :) ~ uPl(zl , tt)A . .  . APm(zm , u ))\ [ RI(Yl , e)A . .  . ARn(yn , c)\] , event-specifying predicates appear in the A -expression while the other predicates remain in the predication Re  . Hereafter , the term event description refers to the ) , -expression , and event predication to the sentence predicate Re  . The two parts together comprise an event representation  . 
4.2 Applying the formalism
In the formalism , (3) represents sentence (1) and (4) , (2): ( Be :) ~ uAgt(J , u ) ALoc(P , u))- , \[Act(v , e)AObj(m , e)\]A (3e :) ~ uAgt(J , u ) ALoc(L , u ))\[ act(v , e)AObj(m , e)\](3)-(Be:)tuAgt(J , u ) AAct(v , u ) AObj(m , u))\[Loc(P , e)\]A(Be:AuAgt(J , u ) AAct(v , u ) AObj(m , u ))\ [ Loc(L , e )\] (4) In (3) , the thematic S-PPs ( in bold ) are represented in the event descriptions , whereas in (4) , the nonthematic VP-PPs are in the event predications  . Now the well-worn given new distinction can be replaced by the more precise distinction made by the event formalism  . Event-speci~ing PPs appear in the event description and contribute to the specification of an event ity in the discourse model  . Predication PPs appear in the event predication and convey new information about the specified entity  . 
The formalism shows how preposing a VPPP can change the meaning of the utterance  . If the PPs in (2) are preposed , as in In Paris , Jim didn't visit museums : in London , hevisited museums , the original reading is lost . This is shown in the representation : -- ( Be : AuAgt ( J , u ) AAct(v , u ) AObj(m , ~)^ Loc(P , t , ))^( Be:XuAat(J , u ) ^ Act(v , u ) ^ Obj(m , u ) ALoc(L , u )) . Since the event descriptions conflict-one event cannot take place in two places - this sentence can no longer be understood as describing a single event  . 
The formalism also shows different effects of negation on event-specifying and predication PPs  . Sentence ( 2 ) denies the existence of any ' Jim visiting museums in Paris'event  , so the quantifier lies within the scope of negation in  ( 4 )  . In ( 3 ) negation scopes only the event predication ; sentence ( 1 ) expresses a negative fact about one event , and an affirmative fact about another . In general , a PP that lies outside the scope of negation appears in the description Pu of a representation of form  ( 3e : Au Pu ) - , \[ Re\] . APP that lies inside appears in the predication Reofform-  , (3e : A , ,P , ,)\[Re\] . 
Finally , the formalism lends insight into differences in entailments  . The following entailment relationship holds for affirmative VP PP sentences  , where R , ,(y , , , e ) represents he PP predicate : ( 3e : Au Pu ) \[Rl ( yl , e ) ^ .   .   . ^R , ,_~( y ,, -1, e)^a .  (~ . , e)\]~(3e:AuP ~)\[ ~ l(y , , e)^ .   .   . ^R . -l(y . -1, e)\] . 
APP predicate Rn(yn , e ) in a negated event predication may or may not be negated  , so the entailment for negative VPPP sentences i blocked :  ( Be : An Pu ) '~\[Ra ( ya , e ) A .   .   . ^ Rn-i(yn-a , e)AS n(y , , , e)\]~(Be:~uPn)- , \[ R1(Yl , e ) A .   .   . ^ Rn-l(y , -1, e)\] . Why SPP sentences have no entailments ia separate matter  . Eliminating an event-specifying PP from an event description yields a representation with a different description  . Intuitively , it seems desirable that no entailment relations hold between differentypes of entities  . The formalism preserves this condition . 
The proposed formalism succeeds in capturing the discourse entity specification relation and lends itself naturally to processing in an NLP system that takes seriously the dynamic nature of context  . Such a system would for each utterance construct an event representation  , search for a discourse entity that satisfies the event description  , and use the event predication to update the information about that entity in the discourse model  . 
3525. Conclusion
A preliminary algorithm for processing highly ambiguous PPs has been worked out in  \[7\]  . The algorithm uses intonation \[9\] , centering and word order information to construct and process event representation sia discourse model structured after  \[4\]  . The wider applicability of the two-part event formalism has not yet been tested  . Nevertheless , one conclusion is that the value of resolving any structural ambiguity can only be measured in terms of the semantics of the structural Iormalism itsel\]  . In the case of VPPP vs . 
SPP ambiguity , an NLP system must not idly wait for syntax to choose how a PP should pragmatically function  . The traditional wisdom-find the meaning and do so efficiently-instead suggests that more productive than demanding of syntax unreasonably diverse expressive powers is to search for direct linguistic or relates of pragmatic meaning that can be efficiently encoded in a dynamic pragmatic formalism  .
