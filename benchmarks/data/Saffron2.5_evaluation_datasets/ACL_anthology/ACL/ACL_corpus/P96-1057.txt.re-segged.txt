We extend the centering model for the resolution of intia-sentential naphor and specify how to handle complex sentences  . An empirical evaluation indicates that the functional information structure guides the search for an antecedent within the sentence  . 
1 Introduction
The centering model ( Grosz et al ,  1995 ) focuses on the resolution of intersentential naphora  . Since intrasentential naphora occur at high rates in realworld texts  , the model has to be extended for the resolution of anaphor at the sentence lvel  . However , the centering framework is not fully specified to han-die complex sentences  ( Suri & McCoy ,  1994) . This underspocification corresponds to the lack of a precise definition of the expression utterance  , a term always used but intentionally left undefined  1  . Therefore , the centering algorithms currently under discussion are not able to handle naturally occurring discourse  . Possible strategies for treating sentence-level anaphora within the centering framework are  1  . processing sentences linearly one clause at a time  ( as suggested by Grosz et al ( 1995 ) ) ,  2 . preference for sentence-external ntecedents which are proposed by the centering mechanism  ,  3 . preference for sentence-internal antecedents which are filtered by the usual binding criteria  ,  4 . a mixed-mode which prefers only a particular set of sentence-internal over sentence-external antecedents  ( e . g . Suri & McCoy (1994)) . 
The question arises as to which strategy fits best for the interaction between the resolution of intra - and intersentential naphora  . In my contribution , evidence for a mixed-mode strategy is brought forward  , which favors a particular set of sentence -internal antecedents given by functional criteria  . 
1C f . the sketchy statements by Brennan et al (1987, p . 155): "\[ . . . \]U is an utterance ( not necessarily a full clause )  \[ . . . \]", and by Grosz et al (1995, p . 209): " U need not to be a full clause . "  2 Constraints on Sentential Anaphora Our studies on German texts have revealed that the functional information structure of the sentence  , considered in terms of the context-boundedness of discours elements  , is the major determinant for the ranking on the forward-looking-centers  ( C ! ( U , )) ( Strube & Hahn ,  1996) . Hence , context-bound discourse le-ments are generally ranked higher in the C ! than any other nonanaphoric element  . The functional information structure has impact not only on the resolution of intersentential anaphora  , but also on the resolution of intrasentential naphora  . Hence , the most preferred antecedent of an intrasentential naphor is a phrase which is also anaphoric  . Consider sentences ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) and the corresponding centering data in Table 1 ( Cb : backward-looking center ; the first dement of the pairs denotes the discoursentity  , the second element the surface ) . In sentence (1) , a nominal anaphor occurs , der T3 100 SX ( a particular note book ) . In sentence (2) , another nominal anaphor appears , der Rechner ( the computer ) , which is resolved to T3100SX from the previou sentence . In the matrix clause , the pronouner ( it ) co-specifies the already resolved anaphorder Rechner in the subordinate clause  .

Table 1: Centering Data for Sentences ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) This example illustrates our hypothesis that intrasentential anaphors preferably co-specify context-bound discours elements  . In order to empirically texts of different types :   15 texts from the information technology ( IT ) domain , one text from the German news magazine Der Spiegel  , and the first chapters of a short story by the German writer Heiner Miiller  2   ( cf .

Table 2: Distribution of Anaphors in the Text Corpus cur , 58 of them (89 , 2% ) have an antecedent which is a resolved anaphor , while only 32 of them (49 , 2% ) have an antecedent which is the subject of the matrix clause  ( cf . Table 3) . These data indicate that an approach based on grammatical roles  ( Sm'i & McCoy , 1994) is inappropriate for the German language , while an approach based on the functional information structure seems preferable  . In addition , we maintain that exchanging rammatical with functional criteria is also a reasonable strategy for fixed word order languages  . 
They can be rephrased in terms of functional criteria  , simply due to the fact that grammatical roles and the information structure patterns we defined  , unless marked , coincide in these languages .

Table 3: Types of Intra-Sentential Antecedents Since the strategy described above is valid only for complex sentences which consist of a matrix clause and one or more subordinate clauses  , compound sentences which consist of main clauses must be considered  . Each of these sentence si processed by our algorithm in linear order  , one clause at a time with the usual centering operations  . Compound sentences which consist of multiple full clauses also have multiple Cb/C ! data  . 
Now , we are able to define the expression utterance in a satisfactory manner : An utterance U is a simple sentence  , a complex sentence , or each full clause of a compound sentence 3 . The C ! of an utterance is computed only with respect o the matrix clause  . Given these findings , complex sentences can be processed at three stages  ( 2a-2c ; transitions from one stage to the next occur only when a suitable antecedent has not been found at the previous tage  ) : 2Liebesgeschichte .

2 . For resolving an anaphor in a subsequent clause of U  , , ( a ) propose already context-bound elements of
Un from left to right 4.
( b ) propose the dements of C : ( Un-1 ) in the given order . 
( c ) propose all dements of Unnot yet checked from left to right  . 
3 . Compute the C!(Un ) , considering only the elements of the matrix clause of Un  . 
3 Evaluation
In order to evaluate the functional approach to the resolution of intrasentential anaphora within the centering model  , we compared it to the other approaches mentioned in Section  1  , employing the test set referred to in Table 2 . Note that we tried to eliminate r-rorchaining and false positives  ( for some remarks on evaluating discourse processing algorithms  , cf . Walker (1989) ; we consider her results as a starting point for our proposal  )  . 
First , we examine the errors which all strategies have in common  ( for the success rate , cf . Table 4) . 
9 9 errors are caused by underspecification at different levels  , e . g . , prepositional naphors (16) , plural anaphors (8) , anaphors which refer to a member of a set (14) , sentence anaphors (21) , and anaphors which refer to a global focus ( 12 ) are not yet included in the mechanism . In 9 cases , any strategy will choose the false antecedent . 
The most interesting cases are the ones for which the performance of the different strategies varies  . The linear approach generates 40 additional errors in the anaphora resolution , which are caused only by the ordering strategy to process each clause of sentences with the centering mechanism  . The approach which prefers intersentential anaphora causes  60 additional errors . Note that this strategy performs remarkably well at first sight  . For 44 of the errors it chooses an intersentential antecedent which is  , on the surface , identical to the correct intrasentential antecedent  . We counthese 44 resolutions as false positives , since the anaphor has been resolved to the false discoursen-tity  . The approach which prefers intrasentential antecedents causes  27 additional errors . These errors occur whenever an intersentential anaphor can be resolved with an incorrect intrasentential antecedent  . 
4We abstract here from the syntactic riteria for filtering out some elements of the current sentence by applying bind-hag criteria  ( Strube & Hahn ,  1995) . Syntactic on straints like control phenomena override the preferences given by the context  .

These errors occur whenever the antecedent of an intrasentential anaphor is not bound by the context  ( which is possible but rare ) and when the anaphor can be resolved at the text level  . 
The results change slightly if semantic/conceptual constraints  ( type and further admissibility constraints ) on anaphor are considered . 22 errors of the linear approach ,   8 errors of the approach which prefers intersentential antecedents  , and 12 errors of the approach which prefers intersentential antecedents can be avoided  . Only 6 errors of the functional approach can be avoided by incorporating semantic riteria  . 
This might constitute a cognitively valid argument for the functional approach-the better the strategy  , the lower the influence of semantics or world knowledge on anaphora resolution  . 
To summarize the results of our empirical evaluation  , we claim that our proposal based on functional criteria leads to substantively better esults for languages with free word order than the linear approach suggested by Grosz et al  ( 1995 ) and the two approaches which prefer intersentential or intrasentential ntecedents  . 
4 Comparison to Related Work
Crucial for the evaluation of the centering model ( Grosz et al ,  1995 ) and its applicability to naturally occurring discourse is the lack of a specification con -ceming how to handle complex sentences and intrasentential anaphora  . Grosz et al sugges the processing of sentences linearly one clause at a time  . 
We have shown that such an approach is not appropriate for some types of complex sentences  . Suri & McCoy (1994) argue in the same manner , but we consider the functional approach for languages with free word order superior to their grammatical criteria  , while , for languages with fixed word order , both approaches should give the same results . Hence , our approach seems to be more generally applicable  . Other approaches which integrate the resolution of sentence - and text-level anaphor are based on salience metrics  ( Haji ~ ov ~ i et al , 1992; Lappin & Leass ,  1994) . We consider such metrics to be a method which detracts from the exact linguistic specifications a we propose them  . 
At first sight , grammar theories like GB ( Chomsky , 1981) or I-IPSG ( Pollard & Sag ,  1994) , are the best choice for resolving anaphor at the sentence-level  . 
But these grammar theories only give filters for excluding some elements from consideration  . Neither gives any preference for a particular antecedent a the sentence-level  , nor do they consider text anaphora . 
5 Conclusions
In this paper , we gave a specification for handling complex sentences in the centering model based on the functional information structure of utterances in discourse  . We motivated our proposal by the constraints which hold for a free word order language  ( German ) and derived our results from data-intensive empirical studies of real texts of different types  . 
Some issues remain open : the evaluation of the functional pproach for languages with fixed word order  , a finegrained analysis of subordinate clauses as Suri & McCoy  ( 1994 ) presented for SX because SY clauses , and , in general , the solution for the cases which caus errors in our evaluation  .
