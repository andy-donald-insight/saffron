O . Abstract
In this paper , we focus on the features of a lexicon for Japanese syntactic analysis in Japanese-to -English translation  . Japanese word order is almost unrestricted and Kc ~ uio-~ti  ( postpositional case particle ) is an important device which acts as the case label  ( case marker ) in Japanese sentences . Therefore case grammar is the most effective grammar for Japanese syntactic analysis  . 
The case frame governed by ) buc~n and having surface case ( Kakuio-shi )  , deep case ( case label ) and semantic markers for nouns is analyzed here to illustrate how we apply case grammar to Japanese syntactic analysis in our system  . 
The parts of speech are classified into 58 subcategories . 
We analyze semantic features for nouns and pronouns classified into subcategories and we present a system for semantic markers  . Lexicon formats for syntactic and semantic features are composed of different features classified by part of speech  . 
As this system uses LISP as the programming language  , the lexicons are written as S-expression in LISP . punched onto tapes , and stored as files in the computer . 
l . Introductign
The Mu-project is a national project supported by the STA  ( Science and Technology Agency )  , the full name of which is " Research on a Machine Translation System  ( Japanese-English > for Scientific and Technological Documents  . ' ~ We are currently restricting the domain of translation to abstract papers in scientific and technological fields  . The system is based on a transfer approach and consist of three phases : analysis  , transfer and generation . 
In the first phase of machine translation.
analysis , morphological analysis divides the sentence into lexical items and then proceeds with semantic analysis on the basis of case grammar in Japanese  . In the second phase , transfer , lexical features are transferred and at the same time  , the syntactic structures are also transferred by matching tree pattern from Japanese to English  , In the final generation phase , we generate the syntactic structures and the morphological features in English  . 
2. Coac_~ptof_~_DeoendencvStructure based on
Case Gramma\[_/nJap_a_D ~
In Japan , we have come to the conclusion that case grammar is most suitable grammar for Japanese syntactic analysis for machine translation systems  . This type of grammar had been proposed and studied by Japanese linguists before 
Fillmore's presentation.
As word order is heavily restricted in
English syntax , ATNG ~ Augmented Transition Network Grammar ) based on CFG ~ ContextFree Grammar ) is adequate for syntactic analysis in English . On the other hand , Japanese word order is almost unrestricted and K ~l!  , jlio--shiplayan important role as case labels in Japanese sentences  . Therefore case grammar is the most effective grammar for 
Japanese syntactic analysis.
In Japanese syntactic structure , the word order is free except for a predicate ( verb or verb phrase ) located at the end of a sentence . In case grammar , the verb plays a very important role during syntactic analysis  , and the other parts of speech only perform in partnership with  , and equally subordinate to . the verb . 
That is . syntactic analysis proceeds by checking the semantic compatibility between verb and nouns  . Consequently . the semantic structure of a sentence can be extracted at the same time as syntactic analysis  .

When semantic markers are recorded for nouns in the verbal case frames  , each noun appearing in relation to l/2u ( ~' n and K clkuio-shi in the sample text is referred to the noun lexicon  . 
The process of describing these case frames for lexicon entry are given in Figure \]  . 
For each verb , l<ctkuio-Mtt and Keiuoudoi ~-_ . shi , Koktuo-shi and case labels able to accompany the verb are described  , and the semantic marker for the noun which exist antecedent to that Kokuio-sh Lare described  . 
4 . Sub-cat ~ or_ies of Parts of SDeech accordiDg to their Syntactic Features The parts of speech are classified into  13 main categories : nouns , pronouns , numerals , affixes , adverbs .

For example , nouns are divided into 11 subcategories ; proper nouns , common nouns , action nouns I(S ~ ! tC~!--~jcishi ) , action nouns 2 ( others . 
adverbial nouns . ~ bk : ? tio-shi-teki-i , ~ ishi ( noun with case feature ~ , ~l ~ : okuio-shi-teki-i ~ i ~ hi ( noun with conjunction feature )  , unknown nouns , mathematical expressions , special symbols and complementizers .

C~in~utsu-futu-shi agrees with aspect , tense and mood features of specific auxiliary verb  , Joukuou-fz~u-shi agrees with aspect and tense , Teido-fuku-shi agrees with gradability . 
Auxiliary verbs are divided into 5 sub-catagories based on modality , aspect , voice , cleft sentence and others . 
Verbs may be classified according to their case frames and therefore it is not necessary to sub-classify their sub-categories  . 
5. Semantic Markimz of Nouna
We analyze semantic features , and assign semantic markers to Japanese words classified as nouns and pronouns  . Each word can give five possible semantic markers . 
The system of semantic markers for nouns is made upoft O conceptual facets based on  44 semantic slots , and 38 plural filial slots at the end ( see Figure 2 )  .

This conceptual facet contains measure : that is , the extent , quantity , amount or degree of a thing . This facet consists of semantic slots such as Number  . Unit , Standard , etc . 
10 i Time and Space
This conceptual facet contains space , topography and time . 
5.2 Process of semantic marking
The semantic marker for each word is determined by the following steps  . 
1 ) Determine the definition and features of a word . 2, Extract semantic elements from the word . 
3 ) Judge the agreement between a semantical slot concept and extracted semantical element word by word  , and attach the corresponding semantic markers . 4; As a result , one word may have many semantic markers . However , the number of semantic markers for one word is restricted to five  . If there are plural filial slots at the end . the higher family slot is used for semantic featurization of the word  . 
It is easy to decide semantic markers for techn ical and specific words  . But , it is not easy to mark common words , because one word has many meanings .

8. con__cJJ ~ i_o_n
We have reached the opinion that it is necessary to develop a way of allocating semantic markers automatically to overcome the ambiguities in word meaning confronting the human attempting this task  . 
In the same thing , there are problems how to find an English term corresponding to the Japanese technical terms not stored in dictionary  , how to collect a large number of technical terms effectively and to decide the length of compound words  , and how to edit this lexicon database easily , accurately , safely and speedily . 
In lexicon development for a huge volume of You ( ~ n , it is quite important that we have a way of collecting automatically many usages of verbal case frames  , and we suppose it exist different case frames in different domains  .
