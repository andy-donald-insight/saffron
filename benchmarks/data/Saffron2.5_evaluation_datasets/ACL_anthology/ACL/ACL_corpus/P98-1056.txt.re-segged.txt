Abstract
We present wo approaches for syntactic and semantic transfer based on LFG fstructures and compare the results with existing co-description and restriction operator based approaches  , focusing on aspects of ambiguity preserving transfer  , complex cases of syntactic structural mismatches as well as on modularity and reusability  . The two transfer approaches are interfaced with an existing  , implemented transfer component ( V erbmobi1) , by translating fstructures into a term language , and by interfacing f-structure representations with an existing semantic based transfer approach  , respectively . 
1 Introduction
Target and source levels of representation i transfer-based machine translation  ( MT ) are subject o often competing demands : on the one hand  , they need to abstract away from particulars of language specific surface realization to ensure that transfer is as simple and straightforward as possible  . On the other hand , they need to encode sufficiently finegrained information to steer transfer  . Furthermore , target and source representations should be linguistically well established and motivated levels of representation  . Finally , from a computational perspective they need to be sensible representations for both parsing and generation  . LFG fstructures are abstract , " high-level " syntactic representations which go some way towards meeting these often irreconcilabler quirements  . 
" We would like to thank H . Kamp , M . Schiehlen and the anonymous reviewers for helpful comments on earlier versions of this article  . Part of this work was funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education  , Science , Research and Technology ( BMBF ) in the framework of the Verbmobil project under grant  01 IV 701   N3  . 
Correspondence-based transfer on fstructures has been proposed in  ( Kaplan et al ,  1989) . 
A closer look at translation problems involving structural mismatches between languages-in particular head switching phenomena  ( Sadler and Thompson ,  1991 ) -led to the contention that transfer is facilitated at the level of semantic representation  , where structural differences between languages are often neutralized  . Structural misalignment is treated in semantics construction involving a restriction operator  ( Kaplan and Wedekind ,  1993 ) where fstructures are related to ( possibly sets of ) disambiguated semantic representations . 
Given the high potential of semantic ambiguities , the advantage of defining transfer on semantic representations could well be counterbalanced by the overhead generated by multiple disambiguated structures as input to transfer  . This and the observation that many semantic ( and syntactic ) ambiguities can be preserved when translating into a target language that is ambiguous in similar ways  , sheds light on the issue of the properties of representations for the task of defining transfer  . 
In principle , the problem of semantic ambiguity in transfer can be tackled in a number of ways  . Packed ambiguity representation techniques ( Maxwell III and Kaplan ,  1993 ) could be integrated with the approach in ( Kaplan and Wedekind ,  1993) . In the linear logic based semantics of ( Dalrympl et al . , 1996 ) scope ambiguities are accounted for in terms of alternative derivations of meaning assignments from a set of meaning constructors  . Ambiguity preserving semantic transfer can be devised on sets of meaning constructors rather than disambiguated meanings  ( Genabith et al ,  1998) . 
Transfer on packed representations is considered In the present paper we consider alternative approaches to transfer on underspecified - syntactic or semantic-representations  , focusing on issues of modularity , reusability and practicality , interfacing existing implemented approaches in a flexible way  . At the same time , the proposals read dress the issue of what is an appropriate level of representation for translation  , in view of the known problems engendered by structural mismatches and semantic ambiguity  . 
We first show how the underlying machinery of the semantic-based transfer approach developed in Dorna and Emele  ( 1996b ) can be ported to syntactic f-structure representations  . 
Second , we show how the underspecified semantic interpretation approach developed in Genabith and Crouch  ( 1997 ) can be exploited to interface f-structure representations directly with the named semantic -based transfer approach  . 
Third , we compare the two approaches with each other , and with co-description and restriction operator based approaches  . 
2 Syntactic Transfer
This section presents a simple bidirectional translation between LFG fstructures and term representations which serve as input to and output of a transfer component developed within the Verbmobil project  ( Dorna and Emele , 1996a ) . The term representation is inspired by earlier work  ( Kay et al , 1994; Caspari and Schmid ,  1994 ) which uses terms as a quasi-semantic representation for transfer and generation  . 
The translation between fstructures and terms is based on the correspondence between directed graphs representing fstructures and the functional interpretation of these graphs  ( cf . ( Johnson , 1991)) . Given an arc labeled f which connects two nodes nl and  n2 in a graph , the same can be expressed by a function f ( nl ) = n2 . An f-structure is the set of such feature equations describing the associated graph  . Instead of feature equations f ( nl ) -- n2 we use the relational notation f ( nl , n2) . 
Using this ideaf structures can be converted into sets of terms and vice versa F-structure  1For motivation why we prefer term representations PRED features and their " semantic form " values are given special treatment  . Instead of introducing PRED terms we build unary relations with the semantic form predicate name as functor  ( see Example ( 1 ) ) . The resulting representation is similar to a Neo -David sonian style event semantics  ( Parsons , 1991) but uses syntactic roles .

Consider the simple head switching example involving the German attitude adverb gerne and the English verb like  ( see ( lb ) and ( 3b ) ) .   ( la ) is the LFG f-structure for the German sentence ( lb )  . 2(lc ) is the set of terms representing ( la ) . 
Transfer works on source language ( SL ) and target language ( TL ) sets of terms representing predicates , roles , etc . like the ones shown in ( lc ) . 
The mapping is encoded in transferules as in (2) . For a rule to be applied , the set on the SL side must be a matching subset of the SL input set  . If this is the case , we remove the covering set from the input and add the set on the other side of the rule to the TL output  . Transfer is complete , if the SL set is empty .

The transfer operator <-> is bidirectional . Uppercase letters in argument positions are logical variables which will be bound to nodes at runtime  . Because of the variable sharings on both sides of a rule we work on the same nodes of a graph  . The result is a graph rewriting process .

Dorna , 1998).
2For presentational purposes we leave out morphosyntactic information in fstructures here and in the following examples  . 

The head switching rule ( 2d ) shows two components on its lefthand side : the part to the right of  #is a test on a copy of the original input  . The test binds the variable Y at runtime when applying the rule from left to right  . In the reverse direction ( and in general ) , TL tests are ignored . 
Applying the rule set in (2) to ( lc) , we get (3c ) . We now use the correspondence btween fstructures and term representations to construct the TL f -structure  . The result is ( 3a ) representing the English sentence ( 3b )  .

Semantic-based transfer as detailed in ( Dorna and Emele , 1996a ; Dorna and Emele , 1996b ) is based on rewriting underspecified semantic representations  . The representations ( Bos et al . , 1996) are UDRS variants ( Reyle , 1993) . 
F-structures are abstract syntactic representations  . They do , however , encode basic predicate-argument relations , and this is essentially semantic information . It turns out that there are important structural similarities between fstructures and UDRSs : fstructures can be " read " as UDRSs and hence be assigned an underspecified truth conditional interpretation  ( Genabith and Crouch ,  1997) .   3 Appendix B gives a relational formulation of the correspondence between fstructures and UDRSs  . 
The UDRS representations are processed by semantic -based transfer  . The resulting system is bidirectional . Consider again the simple head switching case discussed in  ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) above . 
(4) shows the corresponding UDRSs.
The structural mismatch between the two fstructures has disappeared on the level of UDRS representations and transfer is facilitated  .   4   3A similar corespondence between fstructures and QLFs  ( Alshawi and Crouch , 1992) has been shown in ( Genabith and Crouch ,  1996) .

Multiple Adjuncts
How do the two approaches fare with embedded head switching and multiple adjuncts ? Due to space limits we will not discuss straightforward cases where ambiguites represented in underspecified representations are carried over into the target language  . Examples of this type involve quantification alnd plural NPs  , negation , or adjunct sets . Instead , we concentrate on complex cases where a source language ambiguity needs to be resolved in target language  . 
4.1 Embedded Head-Switching
The syntactic transfer rules ( 2 ) are supplemented by ( 5 )  . The complex rule for gerne in ( 5 ) over rides 5 ( 2d ) and the COMP rule in ( 5 )  . For each additional level of embedding triggered by head switching adjuncts a special rule is needed  .

By contrast , on the level of UDRSs head switching has disappeared and transfer is facilitated  . 
Figure 1 shows the transfer correspondence b-tween terms and UDRSs  . 
coding of predicate argument relations is used . The subject of the target like relation is determined by the following transferule : L :gerne  ( L1 )  #L2 ~ L1 , L2:agent(A ) <-> L:like(A , L 1 ) . 
_ ~ is the transitive closure over subordination constraints <  . Here and in the following we do not give set representations of UDRSs and transferules  . Instead , we provide a graphical representations of standard UDRSs to better illustrate the structural mismatches discussion  .

As in the correspondence-based approach ( Ha-plan et al ,  1989) , often can only be assigned widescope over like if the transfer formalism allows reference to and rewriting of partial nodes  .

However ,   ( 11 ) is not in the direct f-structure-UDRS correspondence with  ( 10 ) and ( Sb )  . Instead , the correspondences on the enumerations of the scoping possibilities of  ( 11 ) yield ( 10 ) and ( 8b ) as required . 
By contrast , the reading of ( 6b ) is restricted by the surface order in which the two adverbials occur  . On the semantic level this is reflected in terms of corresponding subordination constraints  ( 12 )  . The target UDRS corresponds to f-structure ( Sb ) . 
OAs an alternative , we can get both readings if we define special rules for adverbials in head switching contexts  , giving them wide or narrow scope relative to the head switching adverbial  . A narrow scope rule is already given in (9) . A wide scope rule would beh DJN(E , X ) #HS(E1) , XC0~IP ( E1 , E ) ~- ADJN(EI , X ) where HS ( E1 ) is a " marker " on the switched adverbial's node El  .

With ( 14 ) the head switching-multiple adjunct interaction is correctly resolved in semantic-based transfer  . Similarly , in syntactic transfer , the precedence constraint ( 13 ) can be used to steer translation to f-structure ( 8b )  . 
5 Discussion
We have presented two alternative architectures for transfer in LFG  . In both cases , transfer is driven by the transfer module developed and implemented by Dorna and Emele  ( 1996a )  . In the case of syntactic transfer , transfer is defined on term representations of fstructures  . In the case of semantic transfer , transfer is defined on UDRS translations of fstructures  . F-structure , term and UDRS correspondences are defined in the Appendix  . The transferules are bidirectional , as are the f-structure-term and f-structure-UDRS correspondences  . 
Co-description based approaches ( Kaplan and Wedekind ,  1993 ) require annotation of source and target lexica and grammars  . By contrast , both approaches presented here support modular grammar development : heyd on't involve additional coding in the grammar specifications  . 
An important issue , noted above , is the problem of ambiguities and ambiguity preserving transfer  . F-structures and UDRSs are underspecified syntactic and semantic representations  , respectively . Both support ambiguity preserving transfer to differing degrees  ( NP scope , operators , adjuncts ) . F-structure based syntactic represen-matches in transfer  . The original co-description based approach in ( Kaplan et al ,  1989 ) faced problems when it came to examples involving embedded head-switching and multiple adjuncts  ( Sadler and Thompson ,  1991) , which led to the introduction of a restriction operator  , to enable transfer on partial fstructures or semantic structures  ( Kaplan and Wedekind ,  1993) . One might suppose that the need to refer to partial structures i an artifact of the correspondence-based approach  , which doesn't allow the mapping from a single node of the source f-structure to distinct nodes in the target f-structure without violation of the functional property of the correspondence  . On closer inspection , though , the rewriting approach to syntactic f-structure -term translations presented above suffers from the very same problems that were met by the correspondence-based approach in  ( Kaplan et al . , 1989) . 
By contrast , transfer on the semantic UDRS representations does not suffer from such problems  . Head switching is dealt within the construction of semantic representations  . Underspecified semantic representations i the form of UDRSs  ( or related formalisms ) offer the following advantanges for transfer : they abstract away from cross-language configurational variation to facilitate transfer  . Unlike the original restriction operator approach  ( Kaplan and Wedekind ,  1993 ) whenever possible they avoid the detour of multiple transfer on disambiguated representations  . At the same time they provide a flexible encoding of information essential to steer transfer  . 
Of course , semantics does not come for freen or does it always blen dasseamlessly with syntactic representations a one would hope for  . Semantics has to be encoded in the grammar or defined in terms of correspondences as below  . 
System design has to address the question where to do what at which cost  . Semantic representations pay off when they are useful for a number of tasks : evaluation  ( as against a database )  , inference and transfer . Even more so when existing resources can be interfaced qua semantic representations : in our case the tested transfer methodology and resources developed in  ( Dorna and Emele , 1996a ) .
