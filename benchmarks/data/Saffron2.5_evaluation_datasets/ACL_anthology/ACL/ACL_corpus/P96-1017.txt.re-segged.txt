Abstract
We propose a treatment of coordination
based on the concepts of functor , argument and subcategorization . Its formalization comprises two parts which are conceptually independent  . On one hand , we have extended the feature structure unification to disjunctive and set values in order to check the compatibility and the satisfiability of subcategorization requirements by structured complements  . On the other hand , we have considered the conjunction e $ ( and ) as the head of the coordinate structure , so that coordinate structure stem simply from the subcategorization specifications of et and the general schemata of a head saturation  . Both parts have been encoded within HPSG using the same resource that is the subcategorization a dits principle which we have just extended  .

(Peter sells a bike and gives a fishing rod to Mary  . ) We claim here that the " local combinatory potential " of lexical heads  , encoded in the subcategorization feature , explains the previous linguistic facts : conjuncts may be of different categories as well as of more than one constituent  , hey just have to satisfy the subcategorization constraints  . 
1 Introduction
Coordination has M ways been a centre of academic interest  , be it in linguistic theory or in computational linguistics  . The problem is that the assumption according to only the constituents of the same category  ( 1 ) may be conjoined is false ; indeed , coordinations of different categories ( 2 ) - ( 3 ) and of more than one constituent ( 4 ) - ( 5 ) should not be dismissed though being marginal in written texts and mus the accounted for  1  . 
1This research as been done for the French coordination et  ( and )  . 
We focus here on the coordination of syntagmatic categories  ( as opposite of lexical categories )  . More precisely , we account for cases of nonconstituent coordination  ( 4 )  , of Right Node Raising ( 5 ) but not for cases of Gapping . 
Our approach which is independent of any framework  , is easily and precisely encoded in the formalism of Head Driven Phrase Structure Grammar  ( HPSG )   ( Pollard and Sag ,  1994) , which is based on the notion of head and makes available the feature sharing mechanism we need  . The paper is organized as follows . Section 2 gives a brief description of basic data and discusse some constraints and available structures  . Section 3 summarizes previous approaches and section 4 is devoted to our approach . 
The french coordination with elserves throughout the paper as an example  . 
1 24   2 A brief description of Basic Data and Constraints The classical typology of coordination  , i . e . coordination of constituents ( 1 ) and of non-constituents , hides some regularity of the phenomenon as it focuses on concepts of constituent and syntactic ate-gory  . 
A coordination of constituent si interpreted as one phrase without any gap  . The constituents may be of the same category ( 1 ) as well as of different categories ( 2 ) - ( 3 )  . However , this last case is constrained as examplified hereafter  2  .

( I ask for the bill and for someone to pay . )  ( 2e ) *\]erends\]'additionetquelqu'unpaie . 
* ( I give back the bill and someone to pay . ) In these examples , the coordinate structure acts as the argument of the verb  . This verb must subcate-gorize for each constituent of the coordination and this is not the case in example  ( 2c ) - ( 2e )  . Note that modelizing coordination of different categories as the unification  ( i . e . underspecification ) of the different categories would lead to accept the six examples or wrongly reject  ( 2d ) according to the descriptions used 3 . 
Coordination of more than one constituent are often classified as Conjunction Reduction  ( 4 )  , Gapping ( la-lb ) and Right Node Raising ( 5 )   ( Hudson ,  1976) .

( Yesterday , Je and anced the waltz and today , the tango . ) In the case of Gapping structures , the subject ( la ) and/or an extracted element ( lb ) is present in the two sides . The only allowed coordinated structure is\[Jean danse lavalse\]et\[Pierreletango \] for  ( la ) and \[ Hier , Jeana dans dlavalse\]et\[aujourd'hui , let ango \] for ( lb ) as wh-sentences on other parts ( \[ lavalse\]el\[Pierre\]or\[lavalse\]el \ [ Pierrele langoj ~ are impossible  . 
A contrario , in the case of Conjunction Reduc-tions , wh-sentences as well as cliticization are al-2The star*marks ungrammatical sentences .

lowed referring to what follows the verb ( as for coordination of constituents ) and treating the arguments simultaneously on the two parts of the coordination :  ( 4a ) Jesai skquidemander unv ~ loetune cannep ~ che .

( Iknow who I ask for them . )  ( 4c ) Jeleur deman de unv ~ loet une can ne~p ~ che . 
( I ask them for a bike and for a fishing rod . ) (4 d ) Jeles leur deman de . 
( I ask them for them.)
Let us remark that a comma is inserted between Marie and sacanne ~ p ~ chein case of extraction before el as in  ( lb )  , indicating the two sentences have not necessarily to be analyzed in the same way:  ( 4e ) Je demande ? Pierreson v ~ loet ? Maries a canne ~ p ~ che  . 
(I ask Peter for his bike and Marie for her fishing rod  . ) (4f ) A Pierre , je demandes on v ~ loet ? Marie , sacanne ~ p ~ che . 
( Peter , I ask for a bike and Marie , for a fishing rod . ) Two structures are available in case of Conjunction Reductions  . One structure corresponds to a coordination of sentences with a gap of the verb after el  , the other one consists in taking the coordinate parallel sequence of constituents as only one structure  . The previous facts argue for the second possibility  ( see also section 3 for criticism of deletion approach )  . 
Last , note that gapping the verb is less compatible with head-driven mechanisms  ( and the comma in ( 4f ) could be such a head mark , see ( BEF , 1996) for an analysis of Gapping coordinations ) . It seems then that the structure needed for Conjunction Reduction is some generalization of the standard structure used for coordination of constituents  . Our proposal is then focused on this extension . We do not care of Gapping cases as their linguistic propertie seem to be different  . 
It remains to integrate Right-Node Raising and to extend these cases to more complicated ones  . Section 4 includes examples of such cases and shows that our proposal can manage them adequately  . 
3 Previous Approaches
There exists a classical way to eschew the question " what can be coordinated ?" if one assumes a deletion analysis  . Indeed , according to this approach ( Chomsky , 1957; Banfield ,  1981) , only coordination of sentences are basic and other syntagmatic coordinations should be considered as coordinations of reduced sentences  , the reduction being performed by deleting repeated elements  . This approach comes up problem of applying transformation i reverse  , in the analysis process ( Schachter ,  1973) . 
A direct approach as been proposed at once by Sag & al  . ( Sag et al ,  1985 ) within the framework of Generalized Phrase Structure Grammar  ( GPSG )  , by ( Pollard and Sag , 1994) within HPSG , and ( Bresnan , 1986) within Lexical Functional Grammar ( LFG) . These approaches have tried to account for coordination of different categories in reducing the constraint from requiring the same category for conjuncts to a weaker constraint of category compatibility  . Whatever the nature of subcategorization information may be  , syntactical in GPSG , hybrid in HPSG , functional in LFG , two categories are compatible if they subsume a " common denominator "  , in this case a common partial structure . 
Technically , the compatibility is checked by computing a " generalization " of categories and imposing the generalization comprises all features expected in the given context  . For example , the context in (6) , that is , the verb ~ tre ( to be ) , expects a predicative argument and both categories NP and AP are just predicative categories  . 
(6) I1estlep ~ rede Marie et tier del ' ~ tre.
( He is Mary's father and proud of it.)
However , this solution cannot be applied generally because all coordinations have not such " natural " intersection  ( see ( 2 ) ) . So we claim that we have nothing else to do but explicitly enumerate  , within the head subcategorization feature , all the structures allowed as complement . 
4 Our Approach
Our proposition involves three stages . We begin by formulating constraints on coordinate structures  , then we define how to build the coordinate structures and we end by specifying how the previous constraints filter through such coordinate structures  . 
4 . 1 Const ra in ts on coord inate s t ructures In order to precisely formulate the constraints on coordinate structures  , we distinguish the role of func-for and that of argument  , where functor categories are those that bear unsatisfied subcategorization requirements  , as it is the case in CategoriM Grammars ( Dowty ,  1988) . Lexical heads ( 1 ) are functors in relation to the arguments they select and  , by composition , any expression that contains an unsaturated functor is a functor  ( 5 ) - ( 7 )  . 
(7 )   I1 pret endd ~ testeretrefuse cesbeaux spots lumineux  . 
(He claims to hate and refuses these beautiful spotlights  . ) Arguments are the complements selected by the head  4  . An argument may often be realized by different categories  . For example , the argument required by savoir ( to know ) may be a NP or a Comple-tive : we say that the requirement is disjunctive and were presenthe different alternatives within subcategorization feature disjunctive values  . An argument specification is then a disjunction of categories  . 
When the lexical head require several complements ( to ask somebody something )  , the requirement is said multiple or n -requirement  . To the extent that disjunction only appears in argument specifications  , an-requirement is a multiset of simple requirements  . 
The choice of set ( or more precisely multiset ) rather than list vMue for the feature SUBCAT allows us to account for Je deman de ~ Pierres on vd lo as well as Je deman des on vd lo ~ Pierre  . Gunji ( Gunji , 1987) makes the same choice . However our criterion can be formalized in a theory whose order of arguments obeys to an obliqueness hierarchy  . 
Requirement inheritance . A functor may compose with another functor or with arguments  . In functor-arguments composition , the resulting expression inherits the unsatisfied requirement from the functor when it is not empty  . For example , in (5) , both conjuncts inherit the unsatisfied requirement from their heads  . Likewise the functor composition inherits a requirement from the unsatisfied functor ~  . In (7) , pret endd ~ tester inherits the unsat-is fied requirement of d~tester  , i . e . the requirement of an object . 
Adjuncts . To account for the continuum which exists from strictly subcategorized complement so adjuncts  , we adopt the hypothesis uggested by ( Miller ,  1991 ) according to which adjuncts could be accorded the same status as arguments by integrating them into the subcategorization requirement through an option a lexical rule  . That would enable us to account for coordination of adjuncts of different categories  ( 3 ) as well as coordination of more than one constituent with adjuncts  ( 10 ) - ( 11 ) below . 
Note that we may still have a special feature ADJUNCT in order to distinguish adjuncts from other complements if necessary  . Note also that these lexical rules can be interpreted statically as well as dy-namicMly  . In the first case , the extended lexicon is precomputed and requires no runtime application  . 
4 In this paper , we restrict arguments o complements . 
In our HPSG encoding , they are treated in the SUBCAT feature . In a Borsley-like manner , we suppose a special feature for the subject . However , our approach can be generalized to subjects . 
5 In functor composition , functors cannot be both unsaturated : ~" 1l promet demanger dsam ~ redesba-nanes . (* he promises to eath is mother bananas . ), cf . 
the Incomplete Constituent Constraint ( Pollard and Sag ,  1994) . 

Satisfiability conditions of requi rements  . 
We observe here that a coordination of different categories may appear as head complement when the head requirement is disjunctive and a coordination of more than one constituent appears when such a requirement is multiple  . Last , functors may conjoin when their subcategorization requirements are compatible  . These observations are synthesized in one coordination criterion  . 
The first observation is summarized in ( C1 ) and illustrated in ( 2' )  . 
(C1 ) A subcategorization 1-requirement is satisfied either by one of the disjuncts or by a coordination of disjuncts  .

(I know her age/that she came here \[ her age and that she came here  . ) The second one is illustrated below , where subcategorization-requirements are satisfied either by : ? a series of n complements which satisfy respectively then requirements  ( 8 ) Je demande ~ Pierreson v@loets a cannep@che . 
( I ask Peter for his bike and for his fishing rod . ) ? a coordination of a series of this kind ( 9 ) Je demande & Pierreson v@loet ~ Maried ' of l ellevient  . 
(I ask Peter for his bike and Mary where she comes from  . ) ? a coordination may concern sub-series of arguments  ( 10 ) Pierreaachet@unlivre & Marie et undisque ? Pierrepour  100F  . 
(Peter has bought a book for Mary and a CD for Peter for  205  . ) ? or sequences of more than one constituent with adjuncts  ( 11 )   ( 11 ) J ' aivu Pierrehier et Marielundi . 
(I have seen Peter yesterday and Marymonday . ) ? or adjuncts of different categories (3) . 
(3 ) Unlivreint@ressantetquej ' auraidu plaisir ? life  . 
(An interesting book and which I will enjoy to read  . ) All these situations are summarized in ( C2 ) :  ( C2 ) A subcategorization n-requirement is satis-\] fled by m arguments  , 0 < m < n ~ either by a se - \[ quence of m arguments such That each argument \[ satisfies one and only one element of the require-Iment or by a coordination of such sequences  . The I result has a n--m requirement . \] Coordination criterion : satisfying and im-posing requirements  . As an entity can be both functor and argument ( 12 ) - ( 13 ) our coordination criterion ( necessary condition ) is the following one : the conjuncts must satisfy the same simple or multiple subcategorization requirement and impose compatible subcategorization requirements  . 
4 . 2 Comput ing the subcategor i za t ion requ i rements compatibility We have now to define an extension of the usual unification U of structures in order to compute the subcategorization requirements compatibility  . This extension is an internal operation over the subcategorization requirements which accounts for disjunctive and set values  . U is the unification of argument specifications defined from U  , U + is its extension to n-requirements . 
? Unification of two argument specific a-t ions ~  and/3  . 
Let us have c~=Vk = l . . . psk , t3 = Vl = l . . . qtz , with categories s ~ , tt , then a U/3 = V ~ , tsk Utt for k , ls . t . skUtl exists undefined if skt Jtt does not exist  , Vk , l ?

In this case ~ U+@=ai/g/3p\[i\]/iE\[1 , n \]) else ~ L/+~ is undefined . 
Note that ( C1 ) and ( C2 ) should be computed simultaneously in order to account for structures as  ( 9 )  . The notion of partial saturation in ( C2 ) allows us to account for coordination of sub -series of arguments as in  ( 10 )  . 
~hnctors coordination and compatibility of requirements  . Functors may be simple (1) , composed (7) , of different structures ( 12 ) or partially saturated ( 13 ) - ( 5 )  .

( I think to offer and that I will receive gifts . )  ( 13 ) Jepense recevoir de Jeanet of frir ? Pierredu caviar de Russie  . 
(I expect o receive from John and offer to Peter
Russian caviar.)
In all cases , when they are conjoined , they share their arguments : there must therefore xist at least one possibility of satisfying them simultaneously  . In this case , the unification of their subcategorization requirements succeeds and they are said to be compatible and the two functors may be conjoined  . This unification has to account for disjunctive values  . 

IT wo n-requirements are compatible iff their uni -Ification //+ succeeds  . I We consider that conjoined functors should have the same valence  6  . Note that the unification of two n-requirements is ambiguous because we may have several permutations which lead to success  . 
4 . 3 How coord inate s t ruc tures are bui l t Until now we have just defined constraints on the coordinate structures but we did not mention how these structures are built  . We want that a coordinate structure inherits features from its conjuncts without necessarily failing in case of conflicting values  . The generalization method ( Sag et al ,  1985 ) has this objective but overgenerates because the conflicting values are ignored  . In contrast , the use of composite categories ( Cooper ,  1991 ) keeps conflicting values within the connective " A "  . Intuitively , if sonage ( herage ) is a NP and qu'elle est venue ici ( that she came here ) is a Completive , sond geet qu'elle es~venueici ( herage and tha ~ she came here ) is a conjunctive composite category NPA Compl . 
The structuring of categories : composite and tuple of categories  . We propose to extend the operation A to complex categories and to use a new connective <  . .  . > in order to define tuple of categories . With these two connectives , a total structuring of categories i possible and all the coordinate structures may have a status  . For example , the underlined expression in ( 14 ) will be represented by the structured category : ( pp , \[NPACornpl\]\L SubcatPPJ /" ( 14 ) Jere commande ~ Pierrelalecture et qu ' ils ' inspire de la Bible  . 
(I recommend to Peter the lecture and that he inspires himself of the Bible  . ) The extension to complex categories is not uniform  . Coordinate structure features are not necessarily composites or tuples of corresponding features from each conjunct  . In fact , features which are allowed to have conflicting values will be compounded  , whereas other features as SUBCAT must unify . This structuring is encoded later within the definition of the lexical entry of et  . 
Lexicalization of the coordination rule . We consider , as in ( Paritong ,  1992) , the conjunctione tas the head of the coordinate structure  . Consequently , coordinate structures no longer have to be postulated in the grammar by a special rule of coordination : they stem simply from the general  6This condition will forbid the conjunction of e . g . 
verbs with SUBCAT lists of different lengths , but which would have a unification under the alternative interpretation  , thus avoiding sentences like * John bought and gave the book to Mary  , ( Miller ,  1991) . 
schemata of the head saturation and the subcategorization specifications of the conjunction  . For sake of simplicity , only binary coordination is treated here . 
( Paritong ,  1992 ) accounts for multiple coordination as a binary structure where the comma has a similar function as a lexical conjunction  . With that one restriction , the tIPSG-like lexical entry of et can be : I Phon \ et\Synsern <\[ xl  ,   .   .   . , IMl >^< llq .   .   .   .   . \[ Mq>lCat=\['Part < Ca, . . . ,CM>A<C~, . . . ,C~M>

' ~ J ' The following LP-constraint on the lexical entry of e t ensures the correct order of conjunction and conjuncts :\[ i \] < conj <\[ i'\]  , where iE\[1 , M \] , i ' E\[1' , M '\] . 
This LP-constraint is the minimum required to distinguish the two parts of the coordinate structure  . However , the functor this coordinate structure ( partially - ) saturates may impose its own LP-constraint ( e . g . an obliqueness hierarchy ) . In such a case , this LP-constraint has to be satisfied simultaneously by the two sets  \[1\]  ,  .   .   . ,\[ M\] and\[lq , . . . ,\[ Mq . 
To represent the inheritance of the complements , here ~ M//+ff ~ , we use a mechanism of argument composition inspired by  ( I-Iinrichs and Nakazawa ,  1994 ) : the conjunction et takes as complement she two conjuncts <  C1  ,   .   .   . , CM > and < C~, .   .   .   , C ~> which may remain unsaturated for their complements  ( \] ~ M and ~4 , and the set ( I~M/~q-(\]?~/ . The coordination of m-tuples , as well as the coordination of simple conjuncts ( M = 1 ) stems from the saturation of the conjunction eL As noted in  4  . 1 . , only the last element of the tuple CM ( or C ~ ) can be unsaturated and be the source of inheritance  . Example of resulting HPSG-like an Mysis is given in figure  1 for the underlined phrase in ( 15 )  .

Intuitively , if ai is a ( possibly disjunctive ) argument specification , an argument ( possibly composite ) satisfies ai iff each element of the composite category matches one dis-junct of ai  . Then , iff fisan-requirement , a tuple ( or a coordination of tuples ) of categories ( possibly composite ) satisfies ffiff each element of the tuple ( for each tuple ) satisfies one and only one argument specification offt  .

Note that these requirement satisfiability conditions allows us to account for example such as  ( 9 )  . 
4.5 A Coding in HPSG
We extend here the functor saturation schemata to the coordination case  , within the framework of Head Driven Phrase Structure Grammar  ( Pollard and Sag ,  1994) . 
A subcategorization n-requirement is satisfied by m arguments  , m < n , either by a sequence of m arguments ( m-tuple ) or by a coordination of m-tuples . The result has a n-m requirement . 
Saturation schemata 7-partial ( ~ #  ) or total ( ~ =  ) of saturated complements ( * ' =  ) total ( ~ =  ) of complements , the last being partially ( ~' #  ) or totally saturated ( ~' =  ) \[ Synsem , Cat\[Subcat ~ U ~'\]\]\]

Its formalization comprises two parts which are conceptually independent  . On one hand , we have extended the feature structure unification to disjunctive and set values in order to check the compatibility and the satisfiability of subcategorization requirements by structured complements  . On the other hand , we have considered the conjunctione tas the head of the coordinate structure  , so that coordinate structures stem simply from the subcategorization specifications of et and a general schemata of the head saturation  . Both parts have been encoded within HPSG using the same resource that is the subcategorization and its principle which we have just extended  . 
It remains to know in which extent our approach can be used for other linguistic phenomena with symetrical sequences of more than one constituent  ( comparative constructions , Mternative constructions ) :  ( 16 ) Paul donne autant decout eaux aux fillesque de pi ~ cesaux gar cons  .
