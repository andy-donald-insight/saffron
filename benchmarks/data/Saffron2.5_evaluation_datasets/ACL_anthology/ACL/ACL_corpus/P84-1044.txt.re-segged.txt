In order to represent speech acts , in a multiagent context , we choose a knowledge representation based on the modal logic of knowledge  KT4 which is defined by Sato . Such a formalism allows us to reason about knowledge and represent knowledge about knowled - ge  , the notions of truth value and of definite reference  . 
IINTRODUCTION
Speech act representation and the language planning require that the system can reason about intensional concepts like knowledge and belief  . A problem resolver must understand the concept of knowledge and know for example what knowledge it needs to achie-ve specific goals  . Our assumption is that a theory of language is part of a theory of action  ( Austin\[4\] )  . 
Reasoning about knowledge encounters the problem of intensionality  . One aspect of this problem is the indirect reference introduced by Frege ~\] during the last century  . McCar-thy \[15\] presents this problem by giving the following example : Let the two phrases : Pat knows Mike's telephone number  ( I ) and Pat dialled Mike ' ste-le phone number ( 2 ) The meaning of the proposition " Mike's telephone number " in  ( I ) is the concept of the telephone number , whereas its meaning in (2) is the number itself . 
Then if we have : " Mary's telephone number = Mike 's telephone number "  , we can deduce that : " Pat dialled Mary's telephone number " but we cannot deduce that : " PatknowsMary's telephone number "  , because Pat may not have known the equality mentioned above  . 
Thus there are verbs like " to know " , " to believe " and " to want " that create an " opaque " context  . For Frege a sentence is a name , reference of a sentence is its truth value , the sense of a sentence is the proposition . In an oblique context , the reference becomes the proposition . For example the referent of the sentence p in the indirect context " A knows that p " is a proposition and no longer at ruth value  . 
MeCarthy \[15\] and Konolige\[II\]have adopted Frege's approach  . They consider the concepts like objects of a first-order language  . Thus one term will denote Mike's telephone number and another will denote the concept of Mike's telephone number  . The problem of replacing equalities by equalities is then avoided because the concept of Mike's telephone number and the number itself are different entities  . 
McCarthy's distinction concept/object corresponds to Frege's sense/reference or to modern logicians ' intension/extension  . 
Maida and Shapiro \[13\] adopt the same approach but use propositional semantic networks that are labelled graphs  , and that only represent intenslons and not extensions  , that is to say individual concepts and propositions and not referents and truth values  . We bear in mind that a semantic network is a graph whose nodes represent individuals and whose oriented arcs represent binary relations  . 
Cohen E6\] , being interested in speech act planning , proposes the formalism of partitioned semantic networks as database to represent an agent's beliefs  . A partitioned semantic network is a labelled graph whose nodes and arcs are distributed into spaces  . Every node or space is identified by its own label  . Hendrix ~9\] introduced it to represent the situations requiring the delimitation of information subsets  . 
In this way Cohen succeeds in avoiding the problems raised by the database approach  . 
These problems are clearly identified by MooreFI7 , 18\] . For example to represent'A does-not believe P ' , Cohen asserts Believe ( A , P ) in a global database , entirely separated from any agent's knowledge base  . But as Appelt ~\] notes , this solution raised problems when one needs to combine facts from a particular database 
For example , from the assertion : know(John , Q ) & know(John , P ~ Q ) where P~Q is in John's database and ~ know ( John , Q ) is in the global database , it should be possible to conclude % know(John , P ) but a good strategy must be found !
In a nutshell , in this first approach which we will call a syntactic alone  , an a-gent's beliefs are identified with formulas in a first-order language  , and propositional attitudes are modelled as relations between an agent and a formula in the object langua-ge  , but Montague showed that modalities cannot consistently be treated as predicates applying to nouns of propositions  . 
The other approach no longer considers the intenslon as an object but as a function from possible worlds to entities  . For instance the intension of a predicate P is the function which to each possible world W  ( or more generally a point of reference , see Scott\[23\] ) associates the extension of P in W . 
This approach is the one that Moore
D 7,18\] adopted . He gave a first-order axio-matization of Kripke's possible worlds semantics  \[12\] for Hintikka's modal logic of knowledge\[ , 0\] . 
The fundamental assumption that makes this translation possible  , is that an attribution of any propositional attitude like " to know "  , " to believe " , " to remember " , " to strive " entails a division of the set of possible worlds into two classes : the possible worlds that go with the propositional attitu-de that is considered  , and those that are incompatible with it . Thus " A knows that P " is equivalent to " P is true in every world compatible with what A knows "  . 
We think that possible worlds language is complicated and unintuitive  , since , rather than reasoning directly about facts that someone knows  , we reason about the possible worlds compatible with what he knows  . This translation also presents some problems for the planning  . For instance to establish that A knows that P , we must make P true in every world which is compatible with A's knowledge  . This set of worlds is a potentially infinite set . 
The most important advantage of
Moore's approach\[17 , 1 83 is that it gives a smart axiomatization of the interaction between knowledge and action  . 
IIPRESENTATION OF OUR APPROACH
Our approach is comprised in the general framework of the second approach  , but instead of encoding Hintikka's modal logic of knowledge in a first-order language  , we consider the logic of knowledge propo-sed by McCarthy  , the decidability of which was proved by Sato \[21\] and we propose a prover of this logic , based on na-tural deduction . 
We bear in mind that the idea of using the modal logic of knowledge in A  . I . 
was proposed for the first time by McCar-thy and Hayes  \[14\]  . 
A . Languages
A language L is a triple ( Pr , Sp , T ) where: . Pr is the set of propositional variables, . Sp is the set of persons, . T is the set of positive integers . 
The language of classical propositional calculus is L =  ( Pr , 6 , ~) . So CSp will also be denoted by 0 and will be called " FOOL " . 
B . Well Formed Formulas
The set of wellformed formulas is defined to be the least set Wff such as:  ( W ) PrCWff ( W2 ) a , b-~Wff implies a DbeWff(W3) S6_Sp , t 6 . T , ae Wffimplles(St ) a ~_W ff
The symbol D denotes " implication ".
(St ) a means " Sknows a at time t "< St > a ( = %  ( St ) ~ a ) means " a is possible for S at time t " . 
Sta ( =  ( St ) aV ( St ) % a ) means " Sknows whether a at time t " . 

C . Hilbert-type System KT 4
The axiom schemata for KT4 are:
At . Axioms of ordinary propositional logic
A2.( St ) a?a
A3. ( Ot ) a ~( Or ) ( St ) a
A4 . (St ) ( aDb ) ~(( Su ) aD(Su ) b ), where t6 u
A5. ( St ) a ~( S t ) ( S t ) a
A6. If a is an axiom , then ( St ) a is an axiom.
Now , we give the meaning of axioms : ( A2 ) says that what is known is true , that is to say that it is impossible to have false knowledge  . If P is false , we cannot say : " John knows that P " but we can say " John believes that P "  . This axiom is the main difference between knowledge and belief  . 
This distinction is important for planning because when an agent achieves his goals  , the beliefs on which hebases his actions must generally be true  . 
( A3) says that what FOOL knows at time t , FOOL knows at time t that anyone knows it at time t  . FOOL's knowledge represents universal knowledge , that is to say all agents knowledge . 
(A4 ) says that what is known will remain true and that every agent can apply modusponens  , that is , he knows all the logical consequences of his knowledge  . 
(A5 ) says that if someone knows something then he knows that he knows it  . This a-xiom is often required to reason about plans composed of several steps  . It will be referred to as the positive introspective axiom  . 
( A6) is the rule of inference.
D . Representation of the notion of truth value.
We give a great importance to the representation of the notion of truth value of a proposition  , for example the utterance :
John knows whether heist aller than
Bill ( I ) can be considered as an assertion that mentions the truth value of the proposition P = John is taller than Bill  , without taking a position as to whether the latter is true or false  . 
In our formalism ( I ) is represented by : John P This disjunctive solution is also adopted by Allen and Perrault D \]" Maida and Sha-piro  \[13\] represent this notion by a node because the truth value is a concept  ( an object of thought )  . 
The representation of the notion of truth value is useful to plan questions : A speaker can ask a hearer whether a certain proposition is true  , if the latter knows whether this proposition is true  . 
E . Representing definite descriptions in conversational systems : 
Let us consider a dialogue between two participants : A speaker S and a hea-rer H  . The language is then reduced to:
S p = ( O , H , S and T = l
Let P stand for the proposition : " The description D in the context C is unique-ly satisfied by E "  . 
Clark and Marshall \[5\] give examples that show that for S to refer to H to some entity E using some description D in a context C  , it is sufficient that P is a mutual knowledge ; this condition is tantamount to ( O ) P is provable . Perrault and Cohen \[20\] show that this condition is too strong . They claim that an infinite number of conjuncts are necessary for successful reference :  ( S ) P & ( S ) ( H ) e & ( S ) (H ) ( S ) e & . . . 
with only a finite number of false conjuncts.
Finally , Nadathur and Joshi ~9\] give the following expression as sufficient condition for using D to refer to E :  ( S ) B D ( S ) ( H ) P & ~ ( ( S ) BO ( S ) ~ ( O ) P ) where B is the conjunction of the set of sentences that form the core knowledge of 
S and ~ is the inference symbole.
IIISCHOTTE-TYPE SYSTEMKT 4'
Gentzen's goal was to build a form a-lism reflecting most of the logical rea-sonings that are really used in mathemati-duction  ( for classical and intultionistic logics )  . Sato ~\] defines Gentzen-type sys-men GT4 which is equivalent to KT4  . We consider here , schStte-type system KT4'   \[22\] which is a generalization of S4 and equivalent to GT4   ( and thus to KT 4 )  , in order to avoid the thinning rule of the system  GT4   ( which introduces a cumber some combinatory )  . Firstly , we are going to give some difinitions to introduce  KT4'  . 
A . Inductive definition of positive and negative parts of a formula F 
Logical symbols are ~ and V .
a . F is a positive part of F .
b . If % A is a positive part of F , then
A is a negative part of F .
c . If ~ A is a negative part of F , then
A is a positive part of F .
d . If AVB is a positive part of F , then A and B are positive parts of F . 
Positive parts or negative parts which do not contain any other positive parts or negative parts are called minimal parts  . 
B . Semantic property
The truth of a positive part implies the truth of the formula which contains this positive part  . 
The falsehood of a negative part implies the truth of the formula which contains this negative part  . 
C . Notation
F\[A+\] is a formula which contains A as a positive part F\[A-\] is a formula which contains A as a negative part  . 
F\[A+ , B-\] is a formula which contains A as a positive part and B as a negative part where A and B are disjoined  ( i . 
e , o ~ e is not a subformula of the o-ther).
D . Inductive definition of F\[.j
From a formula F\[A\] , we build another formula or the empty formula F \[  . \] by dele-ting A : a . If F\[A3?A , then F\[ . \ ] is the empty formula . 
c . If FG\[AVBJ or=GVAJ then.=G\[BJ.
E . Axiom
An axiom is any formula of the form
F\[P +, P-\] where P is a propositional variable.
F . Inference rules ( R !) F\[(AVB)j V~A , FI ( AVB ) \] v ~ B ~ FL ( AVB ) J - - ( R2 ) F\[ ( St ) A3V~A~FT ( s t ) A  ~ ( PO )  ~ ( Su ) A1V . . . V ~( Su ) AmV ~ ( Ou ) B . V . . . V ~ ( Ou ) Bn VC where ( Su ) AI . . . . . ( Su ) Am , ( Ou ) BI, . . . ,  ( Ou )   B6 must appear as neg6-tire parts in the conclusion , and uKt51c9 , F2\[C-\]F , vF2\[J(cut)G . Cut-elimlnation theorem ( Hauptsatz)
Any KT4' proof-figure can be transformed into a KT4' proof-figure with the same conclusion and without any cut as a rule of inference  ( hence , the rule ( R4) is superfluous . The proof of this theorem is an extension of Sch ~tte'sone for  $4'  . This theorem allows derivations " without detour "? 
IV DECISION PROCE DURE
A logical axiom is a formula of the form F\[P + , P-\] . A proof is an single-roo-ted tree of formulas all of whose leaves are logical axioms  . It is grown upwards from the root , the rules ( RI ) ,   ( R2 ) and ( R3 ) must be applied in a reverse sense . 
These reversal rules will be used as " production rules "? The meaning of each production expressed in terms of the pro-granting language PROLOG is an implication ? It can be shown  \[24J that the following strategy is a complete proof procedure : ? The formula to prove is at the star -? Queue the minimal parts in the given formula  ; ? Grow the tree by using the rule ( R ) in priority , followed by the rule ( R2) , then by the rule ( R3) . 
The choice of the rule to apply can be done intelligently  . In general , the choice of ( RI ) then ( R2 ) increases the likelihood to find a proof because these  ( reversal ) rules give more complex formulas . In the case where ( R3 ) does not lead to a loss of formulas , it is more efficient to choose it at first ? The following example is given to illustrate this strategy : 

Take ( A4 ) as an example and let Fo deno-tes its equivalent version in our language  ( Fo is at the start node ) : Fo = ~ ( St )   ( ~ a Vb ) V  ~ ( Su ) aV ( Su ) b where t < uP ~ denotes positive parts and P ? denotes 
I negative parts l
P+=~(St )( ~ aVb ),% ( Su)a , ( Su)b;

By ( R3) we have ( no losses of formulas):
Fl = ~( St ) (% a V b ) V % ( Su ) a V b ?
PI=%(St )( ~ aVb ), ~( Su)a , b
F-=(St )(% aVb ), ( Su ) a
By (~2) we have:
F ~= F ~ V ~ , ( ~ a V b)
P2PIU % (~ aVb)
P2 = P7U ~ a Vb
By ( RI ) we have:
F ~= F ~ V ~ a
P3 P2U~a , a and P~=P2O ~ a
F4 = F2V % b + +
P4 = P2~~b
P ~ = P2 Ub+'P ~ bF 4 is a logical axiom because P4 ~= Finally , we have to apply ( R2) to the last but one node :
F5
F ~ F ~ V ~ a
P5\[P3U~a
P 5  =  P3 iJ a is a logical axiom because P51~ F 5 =\ [ a The generated derivation tree is then :
