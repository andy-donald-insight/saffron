Abstract
There are a number of systems that use a syntaxbased reordering step prior to phrasebased statistical MT . An early work proposing this idea showed improved translation performance , but subsequent work has had mixed results . Speculations as to cause have suggested the parser , the data , or other factors . We systematically investigate possible factors to give an initial answer to the question : Under what conditions does this use of syntax help PSMT ? 1 Introduction Phrase-based statistical machine translation ( PSMT ) translates documents from one human language to another by dividing text into contiguous sequences of words ( phrases ), translating each , and finally reordering them according to a distortion model.
The PSMT distortion model typically does not consider linguistic information , and as such encounters difficulty in language pairs that require specific long-distance reorderings , such as German?English.
Collins et al (2005) address this problem by reordering German sentences to more closely parallel English word order , prior to translation by a PSMT system . They find that this reordering-as-preprocessing approach results in a significant improvement in translation performance over the baseline . However , there have been several other systems using the reordering-as-preprocessing approach , and they have met with mixed success.
We systematically explore possible explanations for these contradictory results , and conclude that , while reordering is helpful for some sentences , potential improvement can be eroded by many aspects of the PSMT system , independent of the reordering.
2 Prior Work
Reordering-as-preprocessing systems typically involve three steps . First , the input sentence is parsed.
Second , the parse is used to permute the words according to some reordering rules , which may be automatically or manually determined . Finally , a phrasebased SMT system is trained and tested using the reordered sentences as input , in place of the original sentences . Many such systems exist , with results being mixed ; we review several here.
Xia and McCord (2004) ( English-to-French translation , using automatically-extracted reordering rules ) train on the Canadian Hansard . On a Hansard test set , an improvement over the baseline was only seen if the translation system?s phrase table was restricted to phrases of length at most four . On a news test set , the reordered system performed significantly better than the baseline regardless of the maximum length of phrases . However , this improvement was only apparent with monotonic decoding ; when using a distortion model , the difference disappeared . Xia and McCord attribute the dropoff in performance on the Hansard set to similarity of training and test data.
Collins et al (2005) ( German-to-English ) use six handcrafted reordering rules targeting the placement of verbs , subjects , particles and negation . They train and evaluate their system on Europarl text and obtain a BLEU score ( Papineni et al , 2002) of 26.8, with the baseline PSMT system achieving 25.2. A human evaluation confirms that reordered translations are generally ( but not universally ) better.
On Web text , Xu et al (2009) report significant improvements applying one set of handcrafted rules to translation from English to each of five SOV lan-Training on news text , Wang et al (2007) ( Chinese-to-English , handcrafted rules ) report a significant improvement over the baseline system on the NIST 2006 test set , using a distance-based distortion model . Similar results are mentioned in passing for a lexicalised distortion model.
Also on news text , Habash (2007) ( automatically-extracted rules , Arabic-to-English ) reports a very large improvement when phrases are limited to length 1 and translation is monotonic . However , allowing phrases up to 7 words in length or using a distance-based distortion model causes the difference in performance to disappear . Habash attributes this to parser and alignment performance . He also includes oracle experiments , in which each system outperforms the other on 40?50% of sentences , suggesting that reordering is useful for many sentences.
Zwarts and Dras (2007) implement six rules for Dutch-to-English translation , analogous to those of Collins et al (2005), as part of an exploration of dependency distance in syntax-augmented PSMT.
Considering only their baseline and reordered systems , the improvement is from 20.7 to only 20.8; they attribute their poor result to the parser used.
Howlett and Dras (2010) reimplement the Collins et al (2005) system for use in lattice-based translation . In addition to their main system , they give results for the baseline and reordered systems , training and testing on Europarl and news text . In strong contrast to the results of Collins et al (2005), Howlett and Dras (2010) report 20.04 for the reordered system , below the baseline at 20.77. They explain their lower absolute scores as a consequence of the different test set , but do not explore the reversal in conclusion . Like Habash (2007), Howlett and Dras (2010) include oracle experiments which demonstrate that the reordering is useful for some sentences.
In this paper , we focus on the Collins et al (2005) and Howlett and Dras (2010) systems ( hereafter CKK and HD ), as they are the most similar but have perhaps the most divergent results . Possible explanations for the difference are differences in the reordering process , from either parser performance or implementation of the rules , and differences in the translation process , including PSMT system setup and data used . We examine parser performance in ?3 and the remaining possibilities in ?4?5.

3 Parser Performance
We first compare the performance of the two parsers used . CKK uses the Dubey and Keller (2003) parser , which is trained on the Negra corpus ( Skut et al , 1997). HD instead uses the Berkeley parser ( Petrov et al , 2006), trained on Negra?s successor , the larger
Tiger corpus ( Brants et al , 2002).
Refer to Table 1 for precision and recall for each model . Note that the CKK reordering requires not just category labels ( e.g . NP ) but also function labels ( e.g . SB for subject ); parser performance typically goes down when these are learnt , due to sparsity . All models in Table 1 include function labels.
Dubey and Keller (2003) train and test on the Negra corpus , with 18,602 sentences for training , 1,000 development and 1,000 test , removing sentences longer than 40 words.
Petrov and Klein (2008) train and test the Berkeley parser on part of the Tiger corpus , with 20,894 sentences for training and 2,611 sentences for each of development and test , all at most 40 words long.
The parsing model used by HD is trained on the full Tiger corpus , unrestricted for length , with 38,020 sentences for training and 2,000 sentences for development . The figures reported in Table 1 are the model?s performance on this development set . With twice as much data , the increase in performance is unsurprising.
From these figures , we conclude that sheer parser grunt is unlikely to be responsible for the discrepancy between CKK and HD . It is possible that parser output differs qualitatively in some important way ; parser figures alone do not reveal this.
Here , we reuse the HD parsing model , plus five

additional models trained by the same method . The first is trained on the same data , lowercased ; the next two use only 19,000 training sentences ( for one model , lowercased ); the fourth uses 9,500 sentences ; the fifth only 3,800 sentences . The 50% data models are closer to the amount of data available to CKK , and the 25% and 10% models are to investigate the effects of further reduced parser quality.
4 Experiments
We conduct a number of experiments with the HD system to attempt to replicate the CKK and HD findings . All parts of the system are available online.1 Each experiment is paired : the reordered system reuses the recasing and language models of its corresponding baseline system , to eliminate one source of possible variation . Training the parser with less data affects only the reordered systems ; for experiments using these models , the corresponding baselines ( and thus the shared models ) are not retrained.
For each system pair , we also run the HD oracle.
4.1 System Variations
CKK uses the PSMT system Pharaoh ( Koehn et al , 2003), whereas HD uses its successor Moses ( Koehn et al , 2007). In itself , this should not cause a dramatic difference in performance , as the two systems perform similarly ( Hoang and Koehn , 2008).
However , there are a number of other differences between the two systems . Koehn et al (2003) ( and thus presumably CKK ) use an unlexicalised distortion model , whereas HD uses a lexicalised model.
CKK does not include a tuning ( minimum error rate training ) phase , unlike HD . Finally , HD uses a 5gram language model . The CKK language model is unspecified ; we assume a 3gram model would be 1http://www.showlett.id.au/

more likely for the time . We explore combinations of all these choices.
4.2 Data
A likely cause of the results difference between HD and CKK is the data used . CKK used Europarl for training and test , while HD used Europarl and news for training , with news for tuning and test.
Our first experiment attempts to replicate CKK as closely as possible , using the CKK training and test data . This data came already tokenized and lowercased ; we thus skip tokenisation in preprocessing , use the lowercased parsing models , and skip tokenisation and casing steps in the PSMT system . We try both the full data and 50% data parsing models.
Our next experiments use untokenised and cased text from the Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation . To remain close to CKK , we use data from the 2009 Workshop,2 which provided Europarl sets for both training and development . We use europarl-v4 for training , test2007 for tuning , and test2008 for testing.
We also run the 3gram systems of this set with each of the reduced parser models.
Our final experiments start to bridge the gap to HD . We still train on europarl-v4 ( diverging from HD ), but substitute one or both of the tuning and test sets with those of HD : newstest2008 and newstest2009 from the 2010 Workshop.3 For the language model , HD uses both Europarl and news text . To remain close to CKK , we train our language models only on the Europarl training data , and thus use considerably less data than HD here.
4.3 Evaluation
All systems are evaluated using case-insensitive BLEU ( Papineni et al , 2002). HD used the NIST BLEU scorer , which requires SGML format . The CKK data is plain text , so instead we report scores 2http://www.statmt.org/wmt09/translation-task.html 3http://www.statmt.org/wmt10/translation-task.html 3 dist ? 26.53 27.34 +0.81 28.93

from the Moses multi-reference BLEU script ( multi-bleu ), using one reference translation . Comparing the scripts , we found that the NIST scores are always lower than multi-bleu?s on test2008, but higher on newstest2009, with differences at most 0.23.
This partially indicates the noise level in the scores.
5 Results
Results for the first experiments , closely replicating CKK , are given in Table 3. The results are very similar to the those CKK reported ( baseline 25.2, reordered 26.8). Thus the HD reimplementation is indeed close to the original CKK system . Any qualitative differences in parser output not revealed by ?3, in the implementation of the rules , or in the PSMT system , are thus producing only a small effect.
Results for the remaining experiments are given in Tables 4 and 5, which give results on the test2008 and newstest2009 test sets respectively , and Table 6, which gives results on the test2008 test set using the reduced parsing models.
We see that the choice of data can have a profound effect , nullifying or even reversing the overall result , even when the reordering system remains the same.
Genre differences are an obvious possibility , but we have demonstrated only a dependence on data set.
The other factors tested?language model order , lexicalisation of the distortion model , and use of a tuning phase?can all affect the overall performance

gain of the reordered system , but less distinctly . Reducing the quality of the parsing model ( by training on less data ) also has a negative effect , but the drop must be substantial before it outweighs other factors.
In all cases , the oracle outperforms both baseline and reordered systems by a large margin . Its selections show that , in changing test sets , the balance shifts from one system to the other , but both still contribute strongly . This shows that improvements are possible across the board if it is possible to correctly choose which sentences will benefit from reordering.
6 Conclusion
Collins et al (2005) reported that a reordering-as-preprocessing approach improved overall performance in German-to-English translation . The reim-(2010) came to the opposite conclusion.
We have systematically varied several aspects of the Howlett and Dras (2010) system and reproduced results close to both papers , plus a full range in between . Our results show that choices in the PSMT system can completely erode potential gains of the reordering preprocessing step , with the largest effect due to simple choice of data . We have shown that a lack of overall improvement using reordering-as-preprocessing need not be due to the usual suspects , language pair and reordering process.
Significantly , our oracle experiments show that in all cases the reordering system does produce better translations for some sentences . We conclude that effort is best directed at determining for which sentences the improvement will appear.
