Abstract
The paper describes the development of software for automatic grammatical an a \] ysi $ of unl ~' U i ~  , unedited English text at the Unit for Compm = Research on the Ev~li~h Language  ( UCREL ) at the Univet ~ of Lancaster . The work is ~ n'nmtly funded by IBM and carried out in collaboration with colleagues at IBMUK  ( W ' ~ ) and IBM Yorktown Heights . The paper will focus on the lexicon component of the word raging system  , the UCREL grammar , the data l ~ zlks of parsed sentences , and the tools that have been written to support developmem of these comlm~ems  . ~wozk has applications to speech technology , sl~lfing conectim , end other areas of naturall ml guage pngess il ~ ~ y  , our goal is to provide a language model using trans in ' ca statistics to di  . ~ . nbigu ~ al . :mative 1 ~ for a speech . : a ~ nicim device . 
1. Text Corpora
Historically , the use of text corpora to provide mnp/ncal data fortes ~ ggramm  . ~e . altheories has been regarded as important to varying degn~es by philologists and linguists of differing pe~msions  . The use of co~uscitations in ~- ~ , ~ma ~ and dictionaries pre~t ~ electronic da ~ a processing  ( Brown . 
1984: 34) . While most of the generative 8 r~- , -a , iam of the 60 S and 70 S ignored corpus ant , ,: the inc~tsed power Of the new t~mlogy , wenlw . l ~ points the way to new applications of computerized text cmlx Ea in diction a ~ mak ln ~_: style checking and speech w  , cognition . Compmer corpora present the computational linguist with the diversity and complexity of real language which is more challenging for testing language models than intuitively derived examples  . 
Ultimately grammatl must be judged by their ability to contend with the teal facts of language and not just basic constructs extrapolated by grammm/ans  . 
2. Word Tagging
The system devised for automatic word tagging or part of speech selection for processing nmn/ng Enfli ~ text  , known as the Constituent-Likelihood Automatic Word-tagging System  ( CLAWS )   ( Garside et aL , 1987) serves as the basis for the current work . The word tagging system is an automated c~mponent of the probabilist/c parsing system we are curnmtly woddng on  . In won/tagging , each of the rurmi . $ words in the coqms text to be processed is associated with a pre-termina/symbol  , denoting word class . In e . ~ enc ~ the CLAWS suite can be conceplually divided imo two phases : tag assignment and tag selection  .

Tag assign meat involves , for each input nmning word or punctuation mask . lexicon lookup , which provides one or more potential word tags for each input word or punctuation mark  . The lexicon is a list of about 8 , 000 records containing fields for ( 1 ) the wordform ( 2 ) the set of one or more ~ u-~41da ~ tabs denoting the wont's word class ( es ) with probability markers attached indicating three ~ levels of  plrl0~tl~lity  . 
Words not in the CLAWS lcxi coame assigned potemial tabseither by suffix list lookup  , which attempts to match end characters of the input wo ~ with a suffix in the ~ or  , if the input word does not have a word . ending to match one of the seenuies , defaul tags are assigned . The procedure semure that ~ words and neolog L~as not : in the lezi~n  . amgiven an analysis .

Figure 2: Section of the Suffix list
Tag selection disambiguates the a Remative tags that are assigned to some of the running words  . Disambiguafion is achieved by invoking one-step probabilities of tag pair E_~kelihoods exmtaed from a previously tagged training corpus and upgrading or downgrading likelihoods according to the probability markets against word tags in the lexicon or suffix list  . In the majority of cases , this first order Ma:kov model is sufficient oc on ~tly select he most likely of tags associated with the input nau ~ g text  .   ( Over 90 perant of running words amcorrectly disambiguat cd in this way  . ) Exceptions me dealt with by invoking a look up procedme that searches through a limited list of groups of two or more words  , or by automatically adjus ~ ng the probabilities of sequences of three tags in cases where the intermediate a gism is leading  . 
The curre at vemm of the CLAWS system requires no pro-editing and auribums the correct  won1 tag to over 96 percent of the input running words , leaving 3 to 4 percast to be conect at bylmaum post . editom . 
3. Error Analysis
En'm " analysis of CLAWS output has resulted , and ccminms to result , indive aue imlaovemems to the system , from the simple adjust m ~ of probability weightings against tags in the lexicon tO the inclusioa of additional procedures  , for in sum~m deal wirefl ~ d is ~ cflonl ~ mpn~r names Pare of the system can also be used to develop new parts  , to extend ~ pans , or to interfaz with other systems . For instam ~ in onler tolz a Xlace a lexicon sufficiently large and denial mou ~ for pm~t  , we_~___dm ~ ~ ori ~ Ustofal mut &000 enuies to or = 20  , 000 ( the new CLAWS lexiccm?oma ~ salmut 26 , 500 enn~es) . .In onfer to do this , a list of 15 , 0 00 wools not aln mdy in the CLAWS lexicon was tagged msn ~ the CLAWS tag as ~ gmnem program  . ( Since they ween ot already in the lexicon , the candidate tags for each new a my were assigned by sut~axlim toolcup or default tag as aignmem  . ) The new list was rhea postedited by interaJ~ive scume di ~ mdm ~ with the old l ~ icon  . 
A not/a ~ example of ' selfim pmvemem ' is in the pnxluaion of a better set of case-stept mmitice a probabilities  . The first CLAWS system used a mat ~ of tag trmst tion probabilities derived fnxn the tagged Brown corpus  ( F-nmc is and gu~em . 
1982) . Some cells of this matrix were inaccurate because of incompmilz'lity of the Brown tagset and the CS  . . . AWS tagset . To remedy this , a new manix was created by a statistics-gathedng program that processed the postedited version of a corpus of one million WOldStagged by the ofigiglal CLAWS suite of programs  . 
4. Subcategorization
A part ~~ gtim vocaiml ~ coverage of the CLAWS lexicon  , we are also subcamgorizing words belonging to the major  won1 classes in order to reduce th cover generation of alternative parses of semences of gx~tter than triviallmgt lLT he task of subcalegorizafion involves :  ( 1 ) a linguist's specification of a schema or typology of lexical sulr  . ategorics based cadistribution alam 1 ( 2 ) a lexicographer's judgement in assigning one or more of them b category codes in the linguist's schenm to the major lexical word forms  ( verbs , nouns , adjectives ) . 
The amount of detail demarcated by the sub ~ttegodzation typology is dependent  , in part , on the practical n~quinnne~s of the system . ~subcategorization systems , uchas the one provided in the Longman Dic~onary of Contempora ~ English  ( 1978 ) or Sager's ( 1981 ) sutr . a togories , needtObe taken into account . But these are assessed critically rather tha a a dop ~ whole sale  ( see for instanoe Akkenmm et al , 1985 and Boguraev et al ,  1987 , for a discussion of the strengths and we a ~____~_ of the LDOCE grammar codes  )  .

Figure 3: The initial schema of eleven verb subcategories We began subca~gorization f the CLAWS lexicon by word-tagging the  3  , 000 most frequem words in the Brown corpus ( Kujra and Francis ,  1967) . An initial system of eleve ~ verb subcategories was proposed  , and judgame~s about which subcategory ( i es ) ach verb belonged to wen : empirically tested by looking upena'ies in the microfiche concordenoe of the tagged Lancaster/Oslo-Bergen corpus CHofland and Johansson  , 1982; Johansson et aL ,  1986 ) which shows every occur ~ nce of a tagged word in the corpus together with its contex LA hout  2  . 500 verbs have been coded in this way , and we are now wo~ng on a more derailed system of about  80 diffem ~ verb subcm~q~des using the Lexicon Development

5. Constituent Analysis
The task of impleme m ~ ap ~ oh a bili ~ c ~ algorifl ~ n to provide a dismnbiguatod conmimant analysis of uormmcxod Enrichismine demanding than implementing the word tagging suite  , not least because , in order to operate in a maon m " similar tO ~ w of d-tag ~\ [ lg model  , the systemm cluims ( 1 ) specification of an appropriate grammar of rules and symbols and  ( 2 ) the consuuc fion of a sufficiently larged : : . bank of parsed smm~es conforming tO the ( op ~ ms D grammar specified in ( 1 ) tO provide suuistics of the relative likelihoods of cons~uemtagmmsitions for consfiut cottag disambigumion  . 
In orderm mee these priorn ~ p t in ~ ms , research e ~ have been employed on a full-time basis to assemble a corpus of parasd ~  6  . Grammar Development and Parsed

The databank of approximately 45 , 0 00" words of manually parsed semences of the Lancaster/Oslo-Bergen corpus  ( Sampson , 1987:83ff ) was processed to . show the disl/nct types of pm duo dond as and ~ ir fn ~ iue ~ of occorrencoing v  , mmAr associated with the Sampsonm : chank . 
of the UCR\]~pm babilistics yslz ~ ( Gandde and Leech , 1987:66 ff ) and mgges~ons from other researchers prompdngnew rules resulted in a new context-f ~ e grammar of about  6  , 0 00 pmductians cresting minesteeply nested slmcun ~ than those of the Sampsong ~ anm ~  .   ( It was antici~m_!~that steeper nesting would mdu cothesize of them ~ e bank requin : d to obtain adequate f'n ~ luency stal~cs  . ) The new ~ w-~rnar is defined descriptively in a Parser's Manual  ( Leech ,  1987 ) and formai Lu ~ as a set of contextfree phrase-su ~ cmn : productions  . 
Developmem of the grammar then proceeded in ~ lem with the construc ~ n of a second  , ~tn hank of parsed sentences , fitting , as closely as pos , ~ ole " the ral as expressed by the grammar . The new databank comprises extracts from newspaper r  , ~ponsdining from 1979-80 in the Associated Press ( A . P ) corpus . Any difficolf las the grammarians had in parsing were resolved  , whine appropriate , by a mending or adding rules tO the grammar . This methodology resulted in the grammar productions by December  1987  .

9. Skeleton Parsing
We are aiming to produce a millinn word corpus of parsed sentences by December  1988 so that we can implement a variant of the CYK algorithm  ( Hopemfl and Ullman ,  1979: 140 ) m obtain a set of pames for each sentence . V Rerbi labelling ( Bahleta L , 1983; Fomey ,  1973 ) could be used to selec the most pm beble prose from ~ e output paineset  . But pmblmm associated with assembling a fully parsed datn hank  ( t ) ~ of pmmmicmml ( 2 )   . ,, H ~ the parsed malm ~ mame volving grammar . 
In order to cimmmvem these problems , a su~-gy of skeleum parsing hmbeen muoduced . In skeleton pms-ing, . gFmmn~mmcream"mininml labelled bracketing by inserting only those labelled bmckem that are unconuvversialnd  , in some cases , by in sm~g brackets with no labels . The grammar validation routine is decoupled from the input programs ochanges to the smmmar cambe made without disrupting the input parsing  . The strategy also ? prevem sextrusive re~o~e editing whenever the grammar is modified  . 
Grammar development and parsed a~t~nkccmtmction are not mt iw  . lyinde I ~ nd_~however . A sulmet ( I0 percant ) of the skeleton pames a ~~ ? for comparison with the current grammar  , wiule another subset ( I percent ) is checked by il ~ grnmmariai ~ . 
Skeleum parting wingive us a partially parsed databank which should limit the alternative parses compatible with the final grammar  . We can either assume each parse is equally likely and use the fiequency weighted productions generated by the pania Uy parse ed:tntm xk to upgrade or downgrade alternative parses or we can use a ' restrained ' outside fmside alger if l~m  ( Baker . 1979) to find the optimal parse .

10. Feamrisation
The development of the CLAWS tagset mdUCREL grammar owes much to the work of Quirk et al  ( 1985 ) while the tags themselves have evolved from the Brown tagset G : ~ and Ku ~ ra  ,  1982) . However , the rules and symbols chosen have been wa ~ l , -~_ into a notation compatible with other theories of grammar  . For in state , tags from the extended ve ~ ion of the CLAWS lexicon have been translated into a formalism compatible with the Winchester pa~er  ( Sharman ,  1988) . A program has also been written to map all of the ten thousand productions of the c~urent UCREL grammar into the notation used by the Gr~-mm~tr Deve/opment Environment  ( (\] DE )   ( Briscoeet at . , 1987; Grovereta L , 1988; Carrolleta L .  1988) . This is al ~ . liminary step in the task of recasting the grammar into a feanne-hased unification formalism which will allow us to radically reduce the size of the rule set while preventing file grammar from over generadng  .
