We present a new compositional tense-aspect de index-ing mechanism that makes use of tense trees as components of discourse contexts  . The mechanism allows reference pisodes to be correctly identified even for embedded clauses and for discourse that involve shifts in temporal perspective  , and permits de indexed logical forms to be automatically computed with a small number of de indexing rules  . 
1 Introduction
Work on discourse structure , e . g . , \[ Reichman , 1985; Grosz and Sidner , 1986; Allen ,  1987\] , has so far taken a rather coarse , high-level view of discourse , mostly treating sentences or sentence-like entities  ( " utterance units ,   .   .   .   . contributions , " etc . ) as the lowest-level discourse elements . To the extent hat sentences are analyzed at all , they are simply viewed as carriers of certain features relevant to suprasentential discourse structure : cue words  , tense , time adverbials , aspectual class , intonational cues , and others . These features are presumed to be extractable in some straightforward fashion and provide the inputs to a higher-level discourse segment analyzer  . 
However , sentences ( or their logical forms ) are not in general " flat , " with a single level of structure and features , but may contain multiple levels of clausal and adverbial embedding  . This substructure can give rise to arbitrarily complex relations among the contributions made by the parts  , such as temporal and discourse relations among subordinate clausal constituents and events or states of affairs they evoke  . It is therefores sen-tial , in a comprehensive analysis of discourse structure  , that these intrasentential relations be systematically brought to light and integrated with larger-scale discourse structures  . 
Our particular interest is in tense , aspect and other indicators of temporal structure  . We are developing a uniform , compositional pproach to interpretation i which a parse tree leads directly  ( in rule-to-rule fashion ) to a preliminary , indezical logical form , and this LF is de indezed by processing it in the current context  ( a well-defined structure )  . Deindexing simultaneously transforms the LF and the context : context-dependent constituents of the LF  , such as operators past , pres and perf and adverbs like today or earlier , are replaced by explicit relations among quantified episodes  ; ( anaphora are also de indexed , but this is not discussed here ) ; and new structural components and episode tokens ( and other information ) are added to the context . This dual transformation is accomplished by simple recursive equivalences and equalities  . The relevant context structures are called tense trees  ; these are what we propose as the " fine structure " of discourse  , or at least as a key component of that fine structure  . 
In this paper , we first review Reichen bach's influential work on tense and aspect  . Then we describe temporal de indexing using tense trees  , and extensions of the mechanism to handle discourse involving shifts in temporal perspective  . 
2 Farewell to Reichenbach
Researchers concerned with higher-level discourse structure  , e . g . , Webber \[1987; 1988\] , Passonneau \ [1988\] and Song and Cohen\[1991\] , have almost invariably relied on some Reichenbach  \[1947\]-1ike conception of tense . The syntactic part of this conception is that there are nine tenses in English  , namely simple past , present and future tense , past , present and future perfect tense , and posterior past , present and future tense 1 ( plus progressive variants )  . The semantic part of the conception is that each tense specifies temporal relations among exactly three times particular to a tensed clause  , namely the event time ( E ) , the reference time ( R ) and the speech time ( S )  . On this conception , information in discourse is a matter of " extracting " one of the nine Re-ichenbachian tenses from each sentence  , asserting the 1Exarnples of expressions in posterior tense are would , was going to ( posterior past ) , is going to ( posterior pesent ) , and will be going to ( posterior future ) . 
232 appropriate relations among E , R and S , and appropriately relating these times to previously introduced times  , taking account of discourse structure cues implicit in tense shifts  . 
It is easy to understand the appeal of this approach when one's concern is with higher-level structure  . By viewing sentences as essentially flat , carrying tense as a toplevel feature with nine possible values and evoking a triplet of related times  , one can get on with the higher-level processing with minimum fuss  . But while there is much that is right and insightful about Reichenbach's conception  , it seems to usunsatis factory from a modern perspective  . One basic problem concerns embedded clauses . Consider , for instance , the following passage . 
(1) John will find this note when he gets home.
(2) He will think ( a ) Mary has left ( b).
Reichenbach's analysis of (2) gives us Eb < S , Rb < Ra , E a , where tl < t ~ means tl is before t2 , as below .

That is , John will think that Mary's leaving took place sometime before the speaker uttered sentence  ( 2 )  . This is incorrect ; it is not even likely that John would know about the utterance of  ( 2 )  . In actuality ,   ( 2 ) only implies that John will think Mary's leaving took place sometime before the time of his thinking  , i . e . , S < Ra , Ea and Eb < Rb , Ra , as shown below . 
S~R a,E ~
EbfRb
Thus , Reichenbach's system fails to take into account the local context created by syntactic embedding  . 
Attempts have been made to refine Reichenbach's theory  ( e . g . , \[ Hornstein , 1977; Smith , 1978; Nerbonne ,  1986\]) , but we think the lumping together of tense and aspect  , and the assignment of E , R , S triples to all clauses , are out of step with modern syntax and semantics , providing a poor basis for a systematic , om-positional account of temporal relations within clauses and between clauses  . In particular , we contend that English past , present , future and perfect are separate morphemes making separate contributions to syntactic structure and meaning  . Note that perfect have , like most verbs , can occur untensed ( " She is likely to have left by now " )  . Therefore , if the meaning of other tensed verbs such as walks or became is regarded as composite  , with the tense morphemes upplying a " present " or " past " component of the meaning  , the same ough to be said about tensed forms of have  . The modals will and would do not have untensed forms  . Nevertheless , considerations of syntactic and semantic uniformity suggest that they too have composite meanings  , present or past tense being one part and " future modality " the other  . 
This unifies the analyses of the modals in sentences like " He knows he will see her again " and " Heknew he would see her again  , " and makes them entirely parallel to paraphrases in terms of going to  , viz . , " He knows he is going to see her again " and " Heknew he was going to see her again  . " We take these latter " posterior tense " forms to be patently hierarchical  ( e . g . , is going to see her has 4 levels of VP structure , counting to as an auxiliary verb ) and hence semantically composite on any compositional ccount  . Moreover , going to can both subordinate , and be subordinated by , perfect have , as in " He is going to have left by then . " This leads to additional " complextenses " missing from Reichenbach's list  . 
We therefore offer a compositional ccount in which operators corresponding to past  ( past )  , present ( pres ) , future ( futr ) and perfect ( perf ) contribute separately and uniformly to the meanings of their operands  , i . e . , formulas at the level of LF . Thus , for instance , the temporal relations implicit in " John will have left " are ob-tMned not by extracting a " future perfect " and asserting relations among E  , R and S , but rather by successively taking account of the meanings of the nested pres  , futr and perfoperators in the LF of the sentence  . As it happens , each of those operators implicitly introduces exactly one episode  , yielding a Reichenbach-liker sult in this case .   ( But note : a simple present sentence like " John is tired " would introduce only one episode concurrent with the speech time  , not two , as in Reichen-bach's analysis . ) Even more importantly for present purposes , each of pres , past , futrand perf is treated uniformly in de indexing and context change  . More specifically , they drive the generation and traversal of tense trees in de indexing  . 
3 Tense Trees
Tense trees provide that part of a discourse context structure  2 which is needed to interpret ( and de index ) temporal operators and modifiers within the logical form of English sentences  . They differ from simple lists of Reichenbachian indices in that they organize pisode tokens  ( for describe depisodes and the utterances themselves  ) in a way that echoes the hierarchy of temporal and modal operators of the sentences and clauses from which the tokens arose  . In this respect , they are an al-2In general , the context structure would also contain speaker and hearer parameters  , temporal and spatial frames , and tokens for salient referents other than episodes  , among other components -- see\[Allen ,  1987\] . 
2 33 ogous to larger-scale representations of discourse structure which encode the hierarchic segment structure of discourse  . ( As will be seen , the analogy goes further . ) Tense trees for successive sentences are " overlaid " in such a way that related episode tokens typically end up as adjacent elements of lists at tree nodes  . The traversal of trees and the addition of new tokens is simply and fully determined by the logical forms of the sentences being interpreted  . 
The major advantage of tense trees is that they allow simple  , systematic interpretation ( by de indexing ) of tense , aspect , and time adverbials in texts consisting of arbitrarily complex sentences  , and involving implicit temporal reference across clause and sentence boundaries  . This includes certain relations implicit in the ordering of clauses and sentences  . As has been frequently observed , for a sequence of sentences within the same discourse segment  , the temporal reference of a sentence is almost invariably connected to that of the previous entence in some fashion  . Typically , the relation is one of temporal precedence or concurrency  , depending on the aspectual class or aktions art involved  ( eft , " John closed his suit case ; He walked to the door " versus " John opened the door  ; Mary was sleeping ") . 
However , in " Mary got in her Ferrari . She bought it with her own money , " the usual temporal precedence is reversed ( based on world knowledge )  . Also , other discourse relations could be implied , such as cause of , explains , elaborates , etc . ( more on this later ) . Whatever the relation may be , finding the right pair of episodes involved in such relations is of crucial importance for discourse understanding  . Echoing Leech\[1987 , p41\] , we use the predicate constant orients , which subsumes all such relations . Note that theorients predications can later be used to make probabilistic or default inferences about the temporal or causal relations between the two episodes  , based on their aspectual class and other information  . In this way they supplement the information provided by larger-scale discourse segment structures  . 
We now describe tense trees more precisely.
Tense Tree Structure
The form of a tense tree is illustrated in Figure 1  . As an aid to intuition , the nodes in Figure 1 are annotated with simple sentences whose indexical LFs would lead to those nodes in the course of de indexing  . A tense tree node may have up to three branches - -a leftward past branch  , a downward perfect branch , and a rightward future branch . Each node contains a stack-like list of recently introduce depisode tokens  ( which we will often refer to simply as episodes )  . 
In addition to the three branches , the tree may have ( horizontal ) embedding links to the roots of embedded tense trees  . There are two kinds of these embedding links , both illustrated in Figure 1 . One kind , utterance pres node .   . . . . . . . . . . ~ h o m e ' t " f He left i (" ~ ~ .   .   .   . ~ K PresHo , , , , o . vo \ He had left He wbuld He will She will think olo  . 
He would have left
Figure 1 . A Tense Tree indicated by dashed lines , is created by subordinating constructions such as VPs with that-complement clauses  . The other kind , indicated by dotted lines , is derived from the surface speech act ( e . g . , telling , asking or requesting ) implicit in the mood of a sentence . 
On our view , the utterances of a speaker ( or sentences of a text , etc . ) are ultimately to be represented in terms of modal predications expressing these surface speech acts  , such as \[ Speaker tell Hearer ( That ~ ) \] or\[Speaker ask Hearer ( Whether ~ ) \] . Although these speech acts are not explicitly part of what the speaker uttered  , they are part of what the hearer gathers from an utterance  . Speaker and Hearer are indexical constants to be replaced by the speaker  ( s ) and the hearer ( s ) of the utterance context . The two kinds of embedding links require slightly different reetraversal techniques as will be seen later  . 
A set of trees connected by embedding links is called a tense tree structure  ( though we often refer loosely to tense tree structures as tense trees  )  . This is in effect a tree of tense trees , since a tense tree can be embedded by only one other tree  . At any time , exactly one node of the tense tree structure for a discourse is in focus  , and the focal node is indicated by ~) . Note that the " tense tree " in Figure 1 is in fact a tense tree structure , with the lowest node in focus . 
By default , an episode added to the right end of a list at a node is " oriented " by the episode which was previously rightmost  . For episode stored at different nodes , we can read off their temporal relations from the tree roughly as follows  . At any given moment , for a pair of episodes e and e ' that are rightmost at nodes n and n '  , respectively , where n ' is a daughter of n , if the branch connecting the two nodes is a past branch  , Is ' ( as we explain later , this yields entailments\[e'beforee\]ife ' is nonstative and\[e'untile\]ife'is stative  , respectively illustrated by " John has left " and " John has been working "  )  ; if it is a future branch , \[ daftere \]; and if it is an embedding link , \[ dat-aboute\] . These orienting relations and temporal relations are not extracted posthoc  , but rather are automatically asserted in the course of de indexing using the rules shown later  . 
As a preliminary example , consider the following passage and a tense tree annotated with episodes derived from it by our de indexing rules :  ( 3 ) John picked up the phone . 
(4) He had told Mary that uj, .  ,?  . . . . . . 2 ' J pas t epick , el?f perfetell CD --/ ~ e2 ~: the would call her . 
ecall u3 and u4 are utterance pisodes for sentences ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) respectively . 
Intuitively , the temporal content of sentence ( 4 ) is that the event of John's telling , et dz , took place before some time el , which is at the same time as the event of John's picking up the phone  , epiek ; and the event of John's calling , eean , is located after sometime e2 , which is the at the same time as the event of John's telling  , eteu . For the most part , this information can be read off directly from the tree : \[ eple ~ orients el \]  , \[ etett before el \] and\[eeattaftere2\] . In addition , the de indexing rules yield\[ e2 same-time tell \] . From this , one may infer\[etell before epic ~\] and\[ ecau after et eu \]  , assuming that the orients relation defaults to same-time here  . 
How does\[epiekorientsel\]defaulto\[epiek same-time eli ? In the tense tree  , el is an episode evoked by the past tense operator which is part of the meaning of had in  ( 4 )  . It is a stative episode , since this past operator logically operates on a sentence of form  ( perf & )  , and such a sentence describes a state in which & has occurred -- in this instance  , a state in which John has told Mary that he will call her  . It is this stativity of el which ( by default ) leads to a same-time interpretation of orients . 4 Thus , on our account , the tendency of past perfect " reference time " to align itself with a  3Or   , sometimes , same-time ( cf . , " John noticed that Mary looked pale " vs . " Mary realized that someone broke hervase ") . 
This is not decided in an adhoc manner , but as a result of systematically interpreting the context-charged relation belT  . More on this later . 
4 More accurately , the default interpretation is \[ ( end-ofepick ) same-time ell , in view of examples involving a longer preceding event  , such as " John painted a picture . He was pleased with the result . " previously introduced past event is just an instance of a general tendency of stative episodes to align themselves with their orienting episode  . This is the same tendency noted previously for " John opened the door  . Mary was sleeping . " We leave further comments about particu-larizing the orients relation to a later subsection  . 
We remarked that the relation \[ e2 same-time tett\]is obtaine directly from the de indexing rules  . We leave it to the reader to verify this in detail  ( see Past and Futr rules stated below )  . We note only that e2 is evoked by the past tense component of would in  ( 4 )  , and denotes a ( possible ) state in which John will call Mary . 
Its stativity , and the fact that the subordinate clause in ( 4 ) is " past-dominated ,   ''5 causes\[ e2 befTeteu\]to be de indexed to \[ e2 same-time tch\] . 
We now show how tense trees are modified as discourse is processed  , in particular , howepisode tokens are stored at appropriate nodes of the tense tree  , and how de indexed LFs , with orients and temporal ordering relations incorporated into them  , are obtained . 
Process in ~ of Utterances
The processing of the ( indexical ) LF of a new utterance always begins with the root node of the current tense tree  ( structure ) in focus . The processing of the toplevel operator immediately pushes a token for the surface speech act onto the episode list of the root node  . 
Here is a typical indexical LF : ( decl ( past\[John know ( That ( past ( ' ,   ( perf\[Mary leave \] ) ) ) )\] ) ) " John knew that Mary had not left . "( decl stands for declarative ; its deindexing rule introduces the surface speech act of type " tell "  )  . As mentioned earlier , our deindexing mechanism is a composition alone in which operators past  , futr , perf ,  - , , That , decl , etc . , contribute separately to the meaning of their oper and s  . As the LF is recursively transformed , the tense and aspect operators encountered , past , perf and futr , in particular , cause the focus to shift " downward " along existing branches  ( or new ones if necessary )  . That is , processing a past operator shifts the current focus down to the left  , creating a new branch if necessary . 
The resulting tense tree is symbolized as/T . Similarly perf shifts straight down , and futr shifts down to the right , with respective results tT and\T . presma intains the current focus . Certain operators embed new trees at the current node  , written ~--~ T ( e . g . , That ) , or shift focus to an existing embedded tree , written ?--* T ( e . g . , decl) . Focus shifts to a parent or embedding node are symbolized as TT and  . --T respectively . As a final tree operation , OT denote storage of episode tokene T ( a new episode symbol not yet used in T ) at the current 5A node is past-domlnated if there is a past branch in its ancestry  ( where embedding finks also count a sancestry links  )  . 
235 focus , as rightmost element of its episode list . As each node comes into focus , its episode list and the lists at certain nodes on the same tree path provide explicit reference episodes in terms of which past  , pres , futr , pert , time adverbials , and implicit " orienting " relations are rewritten nonindexically  . Eventually the focus returns to the root , and at this point , we have a nonindexical
LF , as well as a modified tense tree.
Deindex in ~ Rules
Before we proceed with an example , we show some of the basic deindexing rules here . 6 In the following , "**" is an episodic operator that connects a formula with the situation it characterizes  . Predicates are infixed and quantifiers have restrictions  ( following a colon )  , r

Past : ( past < b ) T ( 3eT:\[\[e T bet T EmbT \] ^ \[ LaSt/T orients eT \ ] \] \[< bo r ** et \]  ) Tree transform : ( past < b ) " T'-I ( < b " ( O/T ) )
Futr : ( futr < b ) T (3et : \[\[ et after F . mbT\]A\[Lastx , TorientseT\]\]\[% . , ** et \]) Tree transform : ( futr < b )" r = , (< b "( O\T ))

That : ( That < b)T ~( That < D_T )
Tree transform : ( That < b ) " T=*-- ( < b " ( ~-* T ) ) As mentioned earlier , Speaker and Hea~er in the Decl-rule are to he replaced by the speaker  ( s ) and the hearer ( s ) of the utterance . Note that each equivalence pushes the dependence on context one level deeper into the LF  , thus de indexing the toplevel operator . The 6See\[Hwang , 1992\] for the rest of our de indexing rules . Some of the omitted ones are : F pres ( " futural present , " as in " John has a meeting tomorrow ") , Prog(progressive aspect ) , Pred(predication ) , K , Ka and Ke (" kinds ") , those for de indexing various operators ( especially , negation and adverbials ) , etc . 
rFor details of Episodic Logic , our semantic representation , see\[Schubert and Hwang , 1989; Hwang and Schubert ,  1991\] . 
symbols NOWT , LastT and EmbT refer respectively to the speech time for the most recent utterance in T  , the last-store depisode at the current focal node  , and the last-store depisode at the current embedding node  . betT in the Past-rule will here placed by either before or same-time  , depending on the aspectual class of its first argument and on whether the focal node of T is past-dominated  . In the Pert-rule , Last T is analogous to the Reichenbachian reference time for the perfect  . The imping es-on relation confines its first argument eT  ( the situation or event described by the sentential operand of pert  ) to the temporal region preceding the second argument  . As in the case of orients , its more specific import depends on the aspectual types of its arguments  . If eT is a stative episode , imping es-on entails that the state or process involved persists to the reference time  ( episode )  , i . e . ,\[ eTuntilLastT\] . If eT is an event ( e . g . , an accomplishment ) , imping es-on entails that it occurred some time before the reference time  , i . e . , \[ e T before LaStT \] , and ( by default ) its main effects persist to the reference time . s
An Example
To see the de indexing mechanismat work , consider now sentences ( ha ) and ( Ca ) . 
(5) a . John went to the hospital.
b .   ( declTa ( past Tb\[Johngo to Hospital \] )   ) Tcc .   ( 3 el:tel same-time Now1\] \[\[ Speakertll Hearer ( That ( 3  e2:\[e2 before ell\[\[Johngo to Hospital \]** e2\]  ) )\] ** ell )   ( 6 ) a . The doctor told John he had broken his ankle . 
b .   ( declTd ( past Te\[Doctortell John ( That If ( pastTg ( pertTh\[John breakAnkle\] ) ) ) \] ) ) t $ c .   ( 3  e3:\[\[e3 same-time Now21 ^\[ el immedia tely-precedes e3\]\] \[\[ Speaker tell Hearer ( That ( 3  e4:\[\[e4 before e3\]  ^ \[  e2 orients e411 \[\[ Doctortell John ( That ( 3eh:\[e5 same-time4\]\[ ( 3  e6:\[e6 beforeeh\]\[\[John breakAnkle\]** e6\]  ) ** es\] ) )\] ** e4\] ) )\] ** e3 \ ] )   8We have formulated tentative meaning postulates to this effect hut cannot d well on the issue here  . Also , we are setting aside certain wellknown problems involving temporal adverbials in perfect sentences  , uch as the inadmissibility of *" John has left yesterday  . "For a possible approach , see\[Schubert and Hwang ,  1990\] . 

The LFs before de indexing are shown in (5 , 6b )   ( where the labelled arrows mark points we will refer to  )  ; the final , context-independent LFs are in (5 , 6c ) . The transformation from ( b ) ' sto ( c ) 's and the corresponding tense tree transformations are done with the de index-ing rules shown earlier  . Anaphoric processing is presup-posed here . 
The snapshots of the tense tree while processing ( 5b ) and ( 6b )  , at points Ta-Ti , are as follows ( with a null initial context ) . 
at a at bat ? at date elelel , e3 el ,  ?3 ?  . . . . . . ~ " ' " - '  .  ~  . . . . . .  .   . . . . . .  .   . - . . . .-- . - . 
at fatgathatiel , e3 el , e3 el , e3 el , e3 e2 , e4ee4/(~6e2 , e4~: The result an tree happens to be unary , but additional branches would be added by further text  , e . g . , a future branch by " It will take several weeks to heal  . "What is important here is , first , that Reichenbach-like relations are introduced compositionally  ; e . g . ,\[ e6 before e5\], i . e . , the breaking of the ankle , e6 , is before the state John is in at the time of the doctor's talking to him  , e4 . 
In addition , the recursive rules take correct account of embedding  . For instance , the embedded present perfect in a sentence such as " John will think that Mary has left " will be correctly interpreted as relativized to John's  ( future ) thinking time , rather than the speech time , as in a Reichenbachian analysis . 
But beyond that , episodes evoked by successive sentences , or by embedded clauses within the same sentence , are correctly connected to each other . In particular , note that the orienting relation between John's going to the hospital  , e2 , and the doctor's diagnosis , e4 , is automatically incorporated into the deindexed formula  ( 6c )  . We can plausibly particularize this orienting relation to \[  e4 after e2\]  , based on the aspectual class of " goto " and " tell "  ( see below )  . Thus we have established inter-clausal connections automatically  , which in other approaches require heuristic discourse processing  . This was a primary motivation for tense trees . Our scheme is easy to implement , and has been successfully used in the TRAINS interactive planning advisor at Rochester\[ Allen and Schubert  ,  1991\] . 
Moreon Par Cicularizin ~ the ORIENTS Rela ? i on Theorients relation is essentially an indicator that there could be a more specific discourse relation between the argument episodes  . As mentioned , it can usually be particularized to one or more temporal  , causal , or other " standard " discourse relation . Existing proposals forgetting these discourse relations right appear to be of two kinds  . The first uses the aspectual classes of the predicates involved to decide on discourse relations  , especially temporal ones , e . g . , \[ Partee ,  1984\] , \ [ Dowty , 1986\] and \[ Hinrichs ,  1986\] . The second approach emphasizes inference based on world knowledge  , e . g . , \[ Hobbs , 1985\] and \[ Lascarides and Asher , 1991; Lascarides and Oberlander ,  1992\] . The work by Lascaridese thi . is particularly interesting in that it makes use of a default logic and is capable of retracting previously inferred discourse relations  . 
Our approach fully combines the use of aspectual class information and world knowledge  . For example , in " Mary got in her Ferrari . She bought it with her own money , " the successively reported " achievements " are by default in chronological order  . Here , however , this default interpretation of orients is reversed by world knowledge : one owns things after buying them  , rather than before . But sometimes world knowledge is mute on the connection  . For instance , in " John raised his arm . 
A great gust of windshook the trees , " there seems to be no world knowledge supporting temporal adjacency or a causal connection  . Yet we tend to infer both , perhaps attributing magical powers to John ( precisely because of the lack of support for a causal connection by world knowledge  )  . So in this case default conclusions based on orients seem decisive  . In particular , we would assume that if e and e ' are nonstative pisodes  ,   9 where e is the performance of a volitional action and e ' is not  , then\[eorients e'\] suggests\[eright -befored\]and  ( less firmly ) \[ ecause of d\] .   1?   4 Beyond Sentence Pairs The tense tree mechanism , and particularly the way in which it automatically supplies orienting relations  , is well suited for longer narratives , including ones with tense shifts . Consider , for example , the following ( slightly simplified ) text from \[ Allen ,  1987 , p400\]: (7) a . Jack and Suewente ~ to a hardware store b . as someone hade~s to len ~5 their lawn mower . 
c . Sue hade4 seene haman take it 9Non-statives could be achievements , accomplishments , cul-minations , etc . Our aspectual class system is not entirely set t led yet  , but we expect to have one similar to that of \[ Moens and 
Steedman , 1988\].
1?Our approach to plausible inference in episodic logic in general  , and to such default inferences in particular , is probabilistic ( see\[Schubert and Hwang , 1989; Hwang ,  1992\]) . The hope is that we will be able to " weigh the evidence " for or against alternative discourse relations  ( as particularizations of orients )  . 
237 d . and had ,, chase de , him down the street , e . but he hade , driven , gawayina truck . 
f . After looking , ,o  in the store , they realized , in that they couldn't afford , ~ a new one . 
Even though be would normally be considered a subsegment of the main discourse a  , f , both the temporal relations within each segment and the relations between segments  ( i . e . , that the substory temporally precedes the main one  ) are automatically captured by our rules . 
For instance , el and ell are recognized as successive episodes , both preceded at sometime in the past by e3 , es , eT , and eg , in that order . 
This is not to say that our tense tree mechanism obviates the need for larger-scale discourse structures  . As has been pointed out by Webber\[1987 ; 1988\] and others , many subnarratives introduced by a past perfect sentence may continue in simple past  . The following is one of Webber's examples : ( 8 ) a . I was , lat Mary's house yesterday . 
b . We talked , 2 about her sister Jane.
c . She hade 3 spent e , five weeks in Alaska with two friends . 
d . Together , they climbed ,, Mt . McKinley.
e . Mary aske doe whether I would want to go to
Alaska sometime.
Note the shift to simple past in d , though as Web-bet points out , past perfect could have been used . The abandonment of the past perfect in favor of simple past signals the temporary abandonment of a perspective anchored in the main narrative- thus bringing readers " closer " to the scene  ( a zoom-in effect )  . In such eases , the tense tree mechanism , unaided by a notion of higher-level discourse segment structure  , would derive incorrect temporal relation such as \[   e5 orients e6\] or \[ e6 right-after es\] . 
We now show possible de indexing rules for perspective shifts  , assuming for now that such shifts are independently identifiable  , so that they can be incorporated into the indexical LFs  . new-pets is a sentence operator initiating a perspective shift for its operand  , and prey-pets is a sentence ( with otherwise no content ) which gets back to the previous perspective . Recent T is the episode most recently stored in the subtree immediately embedded by the focal node of T  . 
New-pets : ( new-pers ?) T *'*\[$,- . TA\[Itecent Torients Recent T , \]\] where T'=$"(~-~T )
Tree transform : ( new-pers ~ ) " T = ~" ( ~-* T ) Prev-pe\]:s : prev-persT--- . T ( True)
Tree transform : prev-pers ? T = ~ T
When new-persis encountered , a new tree is created and embedded at the focal node  , the focus is moved to the root node of the new tree  , and the next sentence is processed in that context  . In contrast with other operators , new-pets causes an overall focus shift to the new tree  , rather than returning the focus to the original root  . Note that the predication \[ Recen*c Torients Recen ' ~ T  , \] connects an episode of the new sentence with an episode of the previou sentence  , prey-pets produces a trivial True , but it returns the focus to the embedding tree , simultaneously blocking the link between the embedding and the embedded tree  ( as emphasized by use of ~ instead of ~--- )  . 
We now illustrate how tense trees get modified over perspective changes  , using (8) as example . We repeat ( Sd , e ) below , augmenting them with perspective changes , and show snapshots of the tense trees at the points marked  .

Notice the blocked links to the embedded tree in T3 and T4  . Also , note that Recent T1 = e4 and Recenl ; T2 = e5 . 
So , by Hew-pets , we get\[e4 orients e5\] , which can be later particularized to \[ e5 during e4\]  . It is fairly obvious that the placement of new -pers and prev-persoperators is fully determined by discourse segment boundaries  ( though not in general coinciding with them )  . So , as long as the higher-level discourse segment structure is known  , our perspective rules are easily applied . In that sense , the higher-level structure supplement she " fine structure " in a crucial way  . 
However , this leaves us with a serious problem : de in -dexing and the context change it induces is supposed to be independent of " plausible inferencing "  ; in fact , determination fhigher-level discourse structure- -and hence of perspective shifts -- is unquestionably a matter of plausible inference  . For example , if past perfect is followed by past , this could signal either a new perspective within the current segment  ( see 8c , d ) , or the closing of the current subsegment with no perspective shift  ( see 7e , f ) . If past is followed by past , we may have either a continuation of the current perspective and segment  ( see 9a , bbelow ) , or a perspective shift with opening of a new segment  ( see 9b , c ) , or closing of the current segment , with resumption of the previous perspective ( see 9c , d) . 
(9) a . Mary found that her favorite vase was broken . 
b . She was upset.
c . She bought it at a special antique auction , d . and she was afraid she wouldn't be able to find anything that beautiful again  . 
Only plausible inference can resolve these ambiguities  . 
This inference process will interact with resolution of anaphor and introduction of new individuals  , identification of spatial and temporal frames , the presence of modal/cognition/perception verbs , and most of all will depend on world knowledge . In (9) , for instance , one may have to rely on the knowledge that one normally would not buy broken things  , or that one does not buy things one already owns . 
As approaches to this general difficulty , we are thinking of the following two strategies :   ( A ) Make a best initial guess about presence or absence of new-pers/prev-pres  , based on surface ( syntactic ) cues and then use failure-driven backtracking if the resulting interpretation is incoherent  . A serious disadvantage would be lack of integration with other forms of disambiguation  . ( B ) Change the interpretation fLaStT , in effect providing multiple alternative referents for the first argument of orients  . In particular , we might use LastT = ei\[ei is the last -store depisode at the focus of T  , or was stored in the subtree rooted at the focus of T after the last-store depisode at the focus of T  . 
Subsequent processing would resemble anaphora disambiguation  . In the course of further interpreting the de in -dexed LF  , plausible inference would particularize the schematic orienting relation to a temporal  ( or causal , etc . ) relation involving just two episodes . The result would then be used to make certain structural changes to the tense tree  ( after LF de indexing )  . 
For instance , suppose such a schematic orienting relation is computed for a simple past sentence following a past perfect sentence  ( like 8c , d ) . Suppose further that the most coherent interpretation f the second sentence  ( i . e . , 8d ) is one that disambiguates the orienting relation as a simple temporal inclusion relation between the successively reported events  . One might then move the event token for the second event  ( reported in simple past ) from its position at the past node to the rightmost position at the past perfect node  , just as if the second event had been reported in the past perfect  .   ( One might in addition record a perspective shift , if this is still considered useful . ) In other words , we would " repair " the distortion of the tense tree brought about by the speaker's " lazy " use of simple past in place of past perfect  . Then we would continue as before . 
In both strategies we have assumed a general coherence-seeking plausible inference process  . While it is clear that the attainment of coherencentails delineation of discourse segment structure and of all relevant temporal relations  , it remains unclear in which direction the information flows  . Are there independent principles of discourse and temporal structure operating above the level of syntax and LF  , guiding the achievement of full understanding , or are higher-level discourse and temporal relations a mere by product of full understanding ? Webber  \[1987\] has proposed independent temporal focusing principle similar to those in \[ Grosz and Sid -net  , 1986\] for discourse . These are not deterministic , and Song and Cohen \[1991\] soughto add heuristic on-straints as a step toward determinism  . For instance , one constraint is based on the presumed incoherence of simple present followed by past perfect or posterior past  . But there are counterexamples ; e . g . , " Mary is angry about the accident . The other driver had been drinking . " Thus , we take the question about independent structural principles above the level of syntax and 
LF to be still open.
5 Conclusion
We have shown that tense and aspect can be analyzed compositionally in a way that accounts not only for their more obvious effects on sentence meaning but also  , via tense trees , for their cumulative ffect on context and the temporal relations implicit in such contexts  . As such , the analysi seems to fit well with higher-level analyses of discourse segment structure  , though questions remain about the flow of information between levels  .
