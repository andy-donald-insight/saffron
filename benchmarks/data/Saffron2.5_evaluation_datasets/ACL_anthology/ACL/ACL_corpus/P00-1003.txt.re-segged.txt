Recent years have seen dramatic developments in the capabilities and applications of spoken language technology  . From a few nicheapplications for a range of expensive solutions  , the eld has developed to the point where keenly -priced products have swept the awards at consumer electronics shows  . Speech recognisers has reached the high-street store  , and a significant proportion of the developed world's population has now been exposed to the possibility of controlling one's computer  , or creating a document , by voice . 
This apparent progress in spoken language technology has been fuelled by a number of developments : the relentless increase in desktop computing power  , the introduction of statistical modelling techniques  , the availability of vast quantities of recorded speech material  , and the institution of public system evaluations . 
However , our understanding of the fundamental patterning in speech has progressed at a much slower pace  , not least in the area of its high-level linguistic properties  . Spoken language understanding continues to be an elusive goal  , and the prosodic linkage between acoustic and linguistic patterning is still something of a mystery  . 
This talk will illuminate these issues , and will conclude with an analysis of the options for future spoken language R&D  .
