Cognitive principles underlying the ( re- ) construc-tion of word meaning and/or world knowledge structures are poorly understood yet  . In a rather sharp departure from more orthodox lines of introspective acquisition of structural data on meaning and knowledge representation in cognitive science  , an empi-rical approach is explored that analyses natural language data statistically  , represents its numerical findings fuzzy-set theoretically  , and inter-pret 5 its intermediate constructs ( stereotype meaning points ) topologically as elements of semantic space . As connotative meaning representations , these elements allow an aspect-controlled , con-tents-driven algorithm to operate which reorganizes them dynamically in dispositional dependency structures  ( DDS-trees ) which constitute a procedurally defined meaning representation format  . 
O . Introduction
Modelling system structures of word meanings and /or world knowledge is to face the problem of their mutual and complex relatedness  . As the cognitive principles underlying these structures are poorly understood yet  , the work of psychologists , AI-re-searchers , and linguists active in that field appears to be determined by the respective disci-pllne's general line of approach rather than by consequences drawn from these approaches ' intersec-ting results in their common field of interest  . In linguistic semantics , cognitive psychology , and knowledge representation most of the necessary data concerning lexical  , semantic and/or external world information is st ill provided introspectively  . Be-searchers are exploring ( or make test-persons explore ) their own linguistic/cognitive capacities and memory structures to depict their findings  ( or let hypotheses about them be tested ) in various representational formats ( lists . arrays , trees , nets , active networks , etc . )  . It is widely accepted that these model structures do have a more or less ad hoc character and tend to be confined to their limited theoretical or operational performances within a specified approach  , subject domain or implemented system . Basically interpretative approaches like these , however , lack the most salient characteristics of more constructive model struc-tures that can be developed along the lines of an entity-re !st lonshio approach  ( CHEN 1980 )  . Their properties of flexibility and dynamics are needed for automatic meaning representation from input texts to build up and /or modify the realm and scope of their own knowledge  , however baseline and vague that may appear compared to human understanding  . 
In a rather sharp departure from those more or tho -doxlines of introspective data acquisition in meaning and knowledge representation research  , the present approach ( I ) has been based on the algorithmic analysis of discourse that real speakers/writers produce in actual situations of performed or intended communication on a certain subject domain  , and ( 2 ) the approach makes essential use of the word -usage/entity-relationship paradigm in combination with procedural means to map fuzzy word meanings and their connotative interrelations in a format of stereotypes  . Their dynamic dependencies ( 3 ) constitute semantic dispositions that render only those conceptual interrelations accessible to automatic processing which can-under differ ing aspects differently-be considered relevant  . Such dispositional dependency structures ( DDS ) would seem to be an operational prerequisite to and a promising candidate for the simulation of contents-driven  ( analogically-associative )  , instead of formal ( logically-deductive ) inferences in semantic processing . 
I . The approach
The empirical analysis of discourse and the formal representation of vague word meanings in natural language texts as a system of interrelated concepts  ( RIEGER 1980 ) is based on a WITTGENSTEINi an assumption according to which a great number of texts analysed for any of the employed terms ' usage regu-larz tie ~ will reveal essential parts of the concepts and hence the meanings conveyed  . 
It has been shown elsewhere ( RIEGER 1980) , that in a sufficiently large sample of pragmatically homogeneous texts  , called corpus , only a restricted vocabulary , i . e . a limited number of lexical items will be used by the interlocutors however comprehensive their personal vocabularies in general might be  . Consequently , the lexical items employed to convey information on a certain subject domain under consideration in the discourse concerned will be distributed according to their conventionalized communicative properties  , constituting semantic re-gu ! aritiez which may be detected empirically from the texts  . 
For the quantitative analysis not of propositional strings but of their elements  , namely words in na-tural language texts , rather simple statistics ser-ve the basical kly descriptive purpose  . Developed from and centred around a correlational measure to specify intensities of cooccurring lexical items used in natural language discourse  , these analysing fragment of the lexical structure constituted by the vocabulary employed in the texts as part of the concomitantly conveyed world knowledge  . 
A correlation coefficient appropriately modified for the purpose has been used as a mapping function  ( RIEGER 1981 a )  . It allows to compute the relational interdependency of any two lexical items from their textual frequencies  . Those items which cooccur frequently in a number of texts will positively be correlated and hence called affined  , those of which only one ( and not the other ) frequently occurs in a number of texts will negatively be correlated and hence called repugnant  . Different degrees of word-repugnancy and word -affinity may thus be ascertained without recurring to an investigator's or his test -persons ' word and/or world knowledge  ( semantic competence )  , but can instead solely be based upon the usage regularities of lexical items obser-vedina corpus of pragmatically homogeneous texts  , spoken or written by real speakers ~ hearers in actual or intended acts of communication  ( communicative performance )  . 
2. The semantic space structure
Following a system-theoretic approach and taking each word employed as a potential descriptor to characterize any other word's virtual meaning  , the modified correlation coefficient can be used to map each lexical item into fuzzy subsets  ( ZADEH 1981 ) of the vocabulary according to its numerically spe-cified usage regularities  . Measuring the differen-ces of anyone's lexical item's usages  , represented as fuzzy subsets of the vocabulary , against those of all others allows for a consecutive mapping of items onto another abstract entity of the theoreti-cal construct  . These new operationally define den-tities - called an item's meanings-may verbally be characterized as a function of all the diffe -rences of all regularities anyone item is used with compared to any other item in the same corpus of discourse  .

Table I : Topological environment E < UNTERNEHM > The resulting system of sets of fuzzy subsets con -stitutes the semantic space  . As a distance-relatio-nal data structure of stereotypically formatted meaning representations it may be interpreted topologically as a hyperspace with a natural metric  . 
Its linguistically labelled elements represent meaning points  , and their mutual distances represent meaning differences  . 
The position of a meaning point may be described by its semantic environment  . Tab . 1 shows the topological envlronment E < UNTNEHM > , i . e . those adjacent points being situated within the hypersphere of a certain diameter around its center meaning point UNTERNEHM/enterprise as computed from a corpus of German newspaper texts comprising some  8000 tokens of 360 types in 175 texts from the 1964 editions of the daily DIE WELT . 
Having checked a great number of environments , % t was ascertained that they do in fact assemble meaning points of a certain semantic affini t y  . Further investigation revealed ( RIEGER 1983 ) that there are regions of higher point density in the semantic space  , forming clouds and clusters . These were detected by multivariate and cluster -analyzing methods which showed  , however , that the both , para-digmatically and syntagmatically , related items formed what may be named connot at lveclouds rather than what is known to be called semantic fle!ds  . 
Although its internal relations appeared to be un -specifiable in terms of any logically deductive or concept hierarchical system  , their elements ' positions showed high degree of stable structures which suggested a regular form of contents-dependant associative connectedness  ( RIEGER 19 Bib )  . 
3. The dispositional dependency
Following a more semiotic understanding of meaning constitution  , the present semantic space model may become part of a word meaning/world knowledge representation system which separates the format of a basic  ( stereotype ) meaning representation from its latent ( dependency ) relational organization . Where - as the former is a rather static , topologically structured ( associative ) memory representing the data that text analysing algorithms provide  , the latter can be characterized as a collection of dynamic and flexible structuring processes to reorganize these data under various principles  ( RIE-6ER 1981 b )  . Other than declarative knowledge that can be represented in predefined semantic network structures  , meaning relations of lexical relevance and semantic dispositlons which are haevly dependent on context and domain of knowledge concerned wil l more adequately be defined procedurally  , i . e . 
by generative algorithms that induce them on changing data only and whenever necessary  . This is achieved by a recursively defined procedure that produces hierarchies of meaning points  , structured under given aspects according to and independence of their meanings ' relevancy  ( RIEGER 1984b )  . 
Corroborating ideas expressed within the theories spreading activation and the process of priming studied in cognitive psychology  ( LORCH 1982 )  , a new algorithm has been developed which operates on the semantic space data and generates - other than in RIEGER  ( 1982 ) -dispositional dependency structures ( DDS ) in the format of nary trees . Given one meaning point's position as a start , the algorithm of least distances ( LD ) w ~ ll first list all its neighbouring points and stack them by increasing distances  , second prime the starting point as head node or root of the DDS-tree to be generated before  , third , the algorithm's generic procedure takes over . It will take the first entry from the stack  , generate a list of its neighbours , determine from it the least distant one that has already been primed  , and identify it as the ancestor-node to be primed next  . Repeated succesively for each of the meaning polnts stacked and in turn primed in accordance with this procedure  , the algorithm will select a particular fragment of the relational structure latent lv inherent in the semantic space data and depending on the aspect  , i . e . the initial-lyprimed meaning point the algorithm is started with  . Working its way through and consuming all lapeled points in the space structure-unless stopped under conditions of given target nodes  , number of nodes to be processed , or threshold of maximum distance-the algorithm transforms pre-vailing similarities of meanings as represented by adjacent points to establish a binary  , non-symme-tric , and transitive relation of semantic relevance between them  . This relation allows for the hierarchical reorganization of meaning points as nodes under a pr  , med head in an n-arv DDS-tree ( RIEGER 1984a ) . 
Without introducing the algorithms formally , some of their operatlve characteristics can well be il-lust rated in the sequel by a few simplif ied examp-les  . Beginning with the schema of a distance-like data structure as shown in the two-dimensional con-figuration of  11 points , labeled atok ( Fig . I . I the stimulation of e . g . points a or c will start the procedure and produce two specific selections of distances activated among these  11 points ( Fig . 
1 . 2) . The order of how these particular distances are selected can be represented either by step-lis ts  ( Fig .  1 . 3), or nary tree-structures ( Fig . 
1.41, or their binary transformations Fig . 1.5).
It is apparent that stimulation of other points within the same configuration of basic data points will result in similar but nevertheless differing trees  , depending on the aspect under which the structure is accessed  , i . e . the point in itlally stimulated to start the algorithm wlth  . 
Applied to the semantic space data of 360 defined meaning points calculated from the text corpus of the  t964 editions of the German newspaper DIE WELT , the Dispositional Dependency Structure ? DDS ) of UNTERNEHM lenterprise is given in Fig . 2 as generated by the procedure described . 
Beside giving distances between nodes in the DDS -tree  , a numerl cal measure has been devised which describes any node's degree of relevance according to that tree structure  . As a numerical measure , a node's crzteriality is to be calculated with respect to its root or aspect and has been defined as a function of both  , its distance values and its leveltn the tree concerned  . For aw~derange of purposes ~ n processing DDS -trees  , different crlte-rialities of nodes can be used to estimate which paths are more l ikely being taken against others being followed less likely under priming of certain meanlng points  . Source-or lented , contents-drlven search and rattlers ! procedures may thus be perfor-med effective ly on the semantlc space structure  , allowing for the actlvatlon of depeneency paths . 
These are to trace those intermediate nodes which determine the associative transitions of any target node under any specifiable aspect  .

Using these tracing capabilities wth in DDS-trees proved particularly promising in an analogical  , contents-driven form of automatic inferencing , hich-as opposed to logical deduction-has ope -rationally be described in RIEGER  ( 1984 c ) and simulated by pay of parallel processing of two  ( or more ) dependency-trees .
