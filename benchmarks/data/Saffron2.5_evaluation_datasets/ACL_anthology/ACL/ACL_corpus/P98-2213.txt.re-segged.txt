Abstract
This paper describes methods for relating ( threading ) multiple newspaper articles , and for visualizing various characteristics of them by using a directed graph  . A set of articles is represented by a set of word vectors  , and the similarity between the vectors is then calculated  . The graph is constructed from the similarity matrix  . By applying some constraints on the chronological ordering of articles  , an efficient hreading algorithm that runs in O ( n ) time ( where n is the number of articles ) is obtained . The constructed graph is visualized with words that represent he topics of the threads  , and words that represent new information in each article  . The threading technique is suitable for Web casting  ( push ) applications . A threading server determines relationships among articles from various news sources  , and creates files containing their threading information  . 
This information is represented in eXtended Markup Language  ( XML )  , and can be visualized on most Web browsers . The XML-based representation adacurrent prototype are described in this paper  . 
1 Introduction
The vast quantity of information available today makes it difficult to search for and understand the information that we want  . If there are many related documents about a topic  , it is important ocapture their relationships o that we can obtain a clearer overview  . However , most information resources , including newspaper articles do not have explicit relationships  . For example , although documents on the Web are connected by hyperlinks  , relationships cannot be specified . 
Web casting ( " push " ) application such as Point-casticonstitute a promising solution to the problem of information overloading  , but the articles they provide do not have links , or else must be manually linked at a high cost in terms of time and effort  . 
This paper describes methods for relating newspaper articles automatically  , and its application for a Web casting application . A set of article on a par-
I http://www . pointcast . comticular topic is ordered chronologically , and the results are represented as a directed graph  . There are various ways of relating documents and visualizing their structure  . For example , USENET articles can be accessed by means of news reader software  . In the system , a label ( title ) is attached to each posted message , specifying whether it deals with a new topic or is a reply to a previous message  . A chain of articles on a topic is called a thread  . In this case , the relationships between the articles are explicitly defined  . 
This post/reply-based approach makes it possible for a reader to group all the messages on a particular topic  . However , it is difficult to capture the story of the thread from its thread structure  , since appropriate titles are not added to the messages  . 
This paper aims to provide ways of relating multiple news articles and representing their structure in a way that is easy to understand and computationally inexpensive  . A set of relationships idefined here as a directed graph  . A node indicates an article , and an arc from node X to Y indicates that the article X is followed by Y  ( or that X is adjacento Y )  . An article contains both known and unknown ( new ) information . Known information consists of words shared by the beginning and ending points of an arc  . When node X is adjacento Y , the words are represented by ( XfqY ) . The known information is called genus words in this paper  . Even if an article follows another one , it generally contain some new information . This information can be represented by subtraction  ( Y-X )   ( Damashek ,  1995) , and is called differentia words , by analogy with definition sentences in dictionaries  , which contain genus words and differentia . In this paper , genus and differentiae words are used to calculate the similarities between two articles  , and to visualize topics in a set of articles . 
Since articles are ordered chronologically , there are sometime constraints on the connectivity of nodes  . A graph is created by constructing an adjacency matrix for nodes  , which in turn is created from a similarity matrix for nodes  . 
Some potential features of articles in a set can be determined by analyzing some formal aspects of the  od5   .   od6 Figure 1: Example of a Directed Graph G corresponding graph  . For example , the paths in the graphs how the stories of the nodes they contain  . 
Multiple paths for a node ( article ) show that there are multiple stories associated with it  . Furthermore , if the node has a long path , it is in the " mainstream " of the topic represented by the graph  . An efficient algorithm for finding such paths is described  , later in the paper . 
Application of the threading method to documents on the Web would be very useful because  , although such documents are connected by hyperlinks  , their relationships cannot be specified . In this paper , generated threads by this method are represented in eXtended Markup Language  ( XML )   ( XML ,  1997) , which is the proposed standard for exchange of information on the Web  . XML-based threads can be used by web casting or push services  , since various tools for parsing and visualizing threads are available  . 
In Section 2 , a directed graph structure for articles is defined  , and the procedure for constructing a directed graph is described in Section  3  . In Section 4 , some features of the created graph are discussed . 
Section 5 introduces a web casting application by using the threading technique  , and Section 6 concludes the paper . 
2 Def in i t ion of a Graph St ructure A set of articles is represented as an ordered set V : 
V = d x , d2, . . . , d , .
The suffix sequence 1, 2, .   .   . , n  represents the passage of time . Article di is older than di + l . The order is obtained from the publication dates of the articles  . 
Differentime points arbitrarily are assigned to articles published on the same day  . 
Related articles are represented as a directed graph  ( V , A ) . V is a set of nodes . A is a set of ordered pairs ( i , j ) , where i and j are members of V . Figure 1 shows an example of a directed graph . 
In this case , the graph is represented as follows : V = dl , d2 , d3 , d4 , ds , d6 , d6 , d7 , A = ( dl , d2) , ( d2 , d3) , ( dl , d4) , ( d5 , d 6) , ( d2 , dT ) , ( d3 , ds ) , ( dT , ds ) The nodes are ordered chronologically . The following constraint is introduced into the graph : 
M = dl d2   d3   d4   d7 dsdx d2   d3   d4   d5   d6   d7 ds 0   1   0   1   0   0   0   0   0   0   1   0   0   0   1   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   1   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   1   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   1   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0 
Figure 3: Adjacency Matrix Mc of G
Constraint 1
For(di , dj ) 6A , i < j
The constraint simply shows that an old article cannot follow a new one  . 
3 Creating a Graph Structure for
Articles
This section describes how to construct a directed graph structure from a set of articles  . Any directed graph can be represented by a matrix  . Figure 3 shows the adjacency matrix MG of the graph G in
Figure 1.
For example , a value of "1" for the (1 ,  2 ) element in M indicates that dx is adjacent od 2 . Since an article cannot follow itself , the value of ( i , i ) elements is "0" . From the time constraint defined in Section 3 , MG is an upper triangle matrix . 
The following is a procedure for constructing a directed graph for related articles :  1  . Calculate the similarity and difference between articles  . 
2. Construct a similarity matrix.
3. Convert the matrix into an adjacency matrix.
In the next section , each step is illustrated by using the set of articles V in Figure  2 on the subject of nuclear testing taken from the Nikkei Shinbun  .  2 3 . 1 Calculating the similarities and differences between articles The function sim  ( di , dj ) calculates the word-based similarity between two articles  . It is defined on the basis of Salton's Vector Space Model  ( Salton ,  1968) . 
Words are extracted from an article by using a morphological analyzer  . Next , nouns and verbs are extracted as keywords . 
_diw disim(di , dj ) = ~- , k , , , wkwk~kWkw ) kkw\] 2The articles were originally written in Japanese . 
1 308 dl : The prime minister of France says that it is necessary to restart nuclear testing  . 
d 2: The Defense Minister suggests restarting nuclear testing  . 
d3: At a summit conference , the Prime Minister will adopt a policy of requesting the French Government to halt nuclear testing  . 
d 4: China's latest nuclear test will hold up negotiations on a treaty to a bolish such testing  . 
d5: The Minister of Foreign Affairs , Mr . Youhei Kohno , takes a critical attitude toward China , and asks France to understand Japan's position . 
d 6: The prime minister of New Zealan dasks the French Government not to restart nuclear testing  . 
dT : President of France states that nuclear testing will restart in September  , and that France will conduct eight tests between ow and next May  . 
d 8: France states that it will restart nuclear testing  . This will hamper nuclear disarmament . 
dg : France states that it will restart nuclear testing  . Australia halts defense cooperation with France . 
dlo : France states that it will restart nuclear testing  . The U . S . expresses ret at the decision . 
Figure 2: V : Articles about nuclear testing Here , di is the weight given to the keyword Wkwkwin article di  . Modification of the TF . IDF value ( Robertson et al , 1976) is used for the weighting . 9 d , is the weight assigned to the keyword kw , kw which is a differentia word for di . 
Cdl(kw ) kdl = . u-(kwl . gw,d,r1 . 5k wE different i a(d i ) gkw = ~1 otherwise . 
Other parameters are defined as follows : k : constant value 
Cd , ( kw ): frequency of word k wind(i)
Cd , : number of words in d(i )
Nk ( kw ) : number of articles that contain the word k wink articles di-k  ,   .   .   .   , di The function differentia ( d ) returns a set of keywords that appear in dj but do not appear in the last k articles  . 
di . fferentia(di ) = kw\[Cd , ( kw ) > 0 , and for all d t , where i-k < l < i , Cd , ( kw ) = O3 . 2 Const ruct ing a s imi lar i ty matr ix A similarity matrix for a set of articles is constructed by using the sim function  . In a conventional hierarchical clustering algorithm  , a similarity for any combination of two articles is required in order to construct a hierarchical tree of the set of articles  . This causes ~ calculations of the similarity function  , for n articles , with a consequent complexity of O(n2) . This is very expensive when n is large . 
In our algorithm for constructing a similarity matrix  , shown in Figure 4 , the complexity of constructing a graph structure for an article set by using a constraint is O  ( n )  . The following constraint , which procedure Make Distance Matrix for i = 2 to n begin if i-k < 1 then s+- 1 elses+--i-k for j = stoi-lbegina ( i , j ) +- sim(di , dj ) j ~ - j + lendi + - i + lend Figure 4: Procedure for Constructing Similarity Matrix includes Constraint  1  , is used for in threading algorithm . 
Constraint 2
For(di , dj ) EA , j-(k+l ) < i < j
This constraint means that an article can only follow the last k articles  . As the result , the number of times the similarity matrix needs to be calculated is reduced by kn  , giving a complexity of O(n ) . 
By using the algorithm , each similarity between nodes is calculated , and the similarity matrix in Figure 5 shows a similarity matrix S of V . In this case , keywords are extracted from title sentences , and k is set to five . 
3 . 3 Convers ion into an ad jacency matr ix From the similarity matrix  , an adjacency matrix is constructed . An elements ( i , j ) in the similarity matrix corresponds to the elements s  ( i , j ) in the adjacency matrix SS . There are various strategies for the conversion . In this paper , ss(i , j ) is set to 1 when s(i , j ) > 0 . 18 , and any node can follow at most k/2 nodes , in this case two nodes . Figure 6 shows a result of the conversion . Finally , a directed graph for V is created ( Figure 7) . Figure 8 shows a graph that visualizes the content of the articles in our example  .

Figure 7: Directed Graph G1 for V
Figure 6: Adjacency Matrix SS Converted from S There are two threads in the graph  . One concerns for France's restarting of nuclear testing  . The other concerns China's latest nuclear test . The " France " thread contains two sub-threads . One concern requests by other countries for France to reconsider its stated intension of restarting nuclear testing  , and the other concerns responses by other countries to the France government's official statement on testing  . 
Some articles are followed by multiple articles . For example ,   d7 is the first official statement on France's restarting of nuclear testing  , and many related articles on this topic follow . 
Each rectangle in Figure 8 represents an article.
Words in a rectangle are differentia words for the articles  . These words show new information in the article , and make it easy to understand the content of the articles  . If a word in an article appears in the differentia words for its parent article  , the word may represent a " turning point " in the story of the articles  . For example , the word " state " is the dif-ferentia word for dT  , and is in its adjacent articles ds , dg , and dlo . This means that d7 is a starting point of the new topic " state . " Such words are called topic words , and are represented in Figure 8 by bold type . 
Several features of the graph visualize the characteristics and relationships of the articles : these features will be discussed in the next section  . 
It is difficult to evaluate the result of threading  . 
We are implementing it in a web casting ( push ) application so that it can be evaluated by the many people who use ordinary web browsers  . The attempt is described in Section 5 . 
4 Features of a Graph
This section describes how the features of a constructed graph represent the characteristics of articles  . 
4.1 Indegree and Outdegree
The indegree is the number of arcs leading to a node  , while the outdegree is the number of arcs leading from it  . The indegree of di can be calculated by adding up the elements in the ith column of an adjacency matrix  . The outdegree of di can be calculated by adding up the elements in the ith row of the matrix  ( Figure 9 )  . In Botafogo et al ( Botafogo et al ,  1992) , a node that has a highout degree is called an index node  , while a node that has a high indegree is called a reference node in their analysis of hypertext  . 
In the set of articles V shown in Figure 9 , d7 is an index node . In this paper , an index node denotes the beginning of a new topic  . When the topic is important , many articles follow , and consequently the out-

The contribution of reference nodes is not clear in V  ( d 6 , ds , and d9 have maxin-degrees ) . Nodes that have high indegree have two characteristics  . The first is that when the articles contain multiple topics  , they have many in bound arcs , each representing a different topic . The second is that when the articles are closely related for a particular topic  , the in-degrees of related nodes increase , since these articles are connected to each other . 
4.2 Path
A path from one node to another node shows the " story flow " of articles  . Multiple paths between two nodes show different stories about the nodes  . 
For example , there are three paths between dl , which is a first node , and dl0 . The shortest path ( dl , d2 , , dT , dl0) gives a simple outline of the articles . 
The longest path ( d , , d2 , d7 , ds , dg , dl0 ) contains all related information on the topic . By extracting long paths from the graph and combining them  , various stories can be created . 
The length of a path shows how the nodes on it \[ along to the " mainstream " of the story  . For ex-mple , the maximum length of a path throughd 6 , is three , while that of a path throughd 7 is five . This means that a path that contains d7 is on a mainstream of the thread and is likely to be continued  . 
The longest paths for nodes can be calculated by using the algorithm shown in Figure  11  . Its complexity is O(n ) , since the maximum number of arcs is at most nk for n nodes  , from Constraint 2 , defined in Section 3 . 2 . 
4.3 Cycle
A cycle 3 shows the existence of a topic . In V , dT , ds , dg , dl0 is a cycle for the topic " statement . " By recognizing cycles , we can extractopics from the whole graph . Furthermore , we can abstract articles by reducing cycles to single nodes  . 
5 XML-based Representation for

It is important that the threading information be exchangeable when we apply our method to Web documents  . Extended Markup Language ( XML ) is a proposed standard ( XML ,  1997 ) specified by the World Wide Web Consortium ( W3C )  . In XML , tags and 3Formally , it is called a semi-cycle , since the graph is directed . 
1311 attributes can be defined , whereas in HTML they are fixed . XML documents can be used to exchange information that has various data structure  . For example , Channel Definition Format ( CDF ) ( CDF ,  1997 ) is a standard to offer frequently updated collections of information  ( channels ) on Web . A CDF document can contains a collection of articles that have tree structure  . In this paper , graph structures of created threads are represented in XML  . Figure 10 shows a part of the thread in Figure 8 . 
The < thread > tag shows the beginning of the thread  . It contains a set of deceptions for articles , each marked < article > . Each instance of the < article > tag has a reference to its source document  , an identifying id , genus and differentia words , and other information on the article . The tag < follows > is used to denote arcs from the article to related articles  . 
The XML documents can be separate from the source articles  . They can be provided as part of a " push " service for Internet users  , offering a solution to the problem of information overloading  . In such a service , gatherer collects articles from Web sites and threader makes threads for them  . The results are stored in XML , and then pushed to subscribers who can capture the flow of topics by following the threads  . In another scenario , when a user gets an article , and wants to see its origin or the next related article  , he or she gets the thread containing the article by consulting the threading server  . The advantage of using XML is that it will be supported by various tools  , including Web browsers . Now we are prototyping the threading service system by using a XML processor developed at our laboratory  . 
Figure 12 shows a Java applet for viewing threads , which can run on major Web browsers . AXML document is parsed and visualized as treelike structure  . 
6 Related Work
There have been several studies how to relate articles  ( McKeown et al , 1995; Yamamoto et al , 1995; Mani et al ,  1997) . McKeown et al reported a method for summarizing news articles  ( McKeown et al ,  1995) . In their approach , templates , which have slots and their values ( for example , incident-location="New York ") , are extracted from the articles . Summary sentences are constructed by combining the templates  . Although this approach can capture topics contained in the articles  , the relationships between articles are not visualized  . 
Clustering techniques make it possible to visualize the contents of a set of documents  . Hearst et al . proposed the scatter/gather approach for facilitating information retrieval  ( Hearst et al ,  1995) . 
Maarek et al related documents by using an hierarchical clustering algorithm that interacts with the user  . Although these clustering algorithms impose a procedure GetMaxtPath  ( A ) // Getmax path MaxPath\[i \] for di . A is a set of arcs . 
for i = 1 ton begin MaxPath\[i\]+-NULL end for j = 1 to n begin for i = j-k to j-l beg in if ( d i , dj ) EAthen if Length ( MaxPath\[j\] ) < Length ( MaxPath\[i \] ) +1 then MaxPath\[j\]e--Connect ( MaxPath\[i\] , (di , dj ) ) i + - - i + 1 endj+-j + lend procedure Length ( path ) returns the number of arcs in path . 
procedure Connect(path , arc ) if path = ( do , . . . , di ) and arc = ( di , dj ), then return ( do , . . . , di , dj) . 
Figure 11: Procedure for Finding the Longest Path heavy computation cost  , our threading algorithm is efficient , because it uses a chronological constraint . 
7 Conclusion
We have described methods for threading multiple articles and for visualizing various characteristics of them by using directed graphs  . An efficient hread-ing algorithm whose complexity is O  ( n )   ( where n is the number of articles ) was introduced with some constraints on the chronological ordering of articles  . 
Some further work can be done to improve our method  . There are sonie strategies for constructing an adjacency matrix from a distance matrix  . Different strategies give different graphs . We are now evaluating our method by testing it with various strategies  . 
The development of a technique for visualizing directed graphs is another task for the future  . Although directed graphs show more useful information than tree structures  , they are difficult to display in a readily understandable way  . Software tools for handling graphs are also required  . 
Formal features of graphs can express the underlying characteristics of articles  . More efficient and useful algorithms are needed to overcome the problem of information overload  .
