Languages differ in the concepts and realworld entities for which they have words and grammatical constructs  . Therefore translation must sometimes be a matter of approximating the meaning of a source language text rather than finding an exact counterpart in the target language  . We propose a translation framework based on Situation Theory  . 
The basic ingredients are an information lattice , a representation scheme for utterances embedded in contexts  , and a mismatch resolution scheme defined in terms of information flow  . We motivate our approach with examples of translation between English and Japanese  . 
1 Introduction
The focus of machine translation ( MT ) technology has been on the translation of sentence structures out of context  . This is doomed to limited quality and generality since the grammars of unlike languages often require different kinds of contextual information  . Translation between English and Japanese is a dramatic one  . The definiteness and number information required in English grammar is mostly lacking in Japanese  , whereas the hon-oricity and speaker's perspectivity information required in Japanese grammar is mostly lacking in English  . There are fundamental discrepancies in the extent and types of information that the grammars of these languages choose to encode  . 
An MT system needs to reason about the context of utterance  . It should make adequate assumptions when the information required by the target language grammar is only implicit in the source language  . It should recognize a particular discrepancy between the two grammars  , and systematically react to the needs of the target language  . 
We propose a general reasoning-based model for handling translation mismatches  . Implicit information is assumed only when required by the target language grammar  , and only when the source language text allows it in the given context  . Translation is thus viewed as a chain of reactive reasoning * Linguistic Systems  , Fujitsu Laboratories Ltd . 
between the source and target languages . 1 An MT system under this view needs : ( a ) a uniform representation of the context and content of utterances in discourse across languages  ,   ( b ) a set of well-defined reasoning processes within and across languages based on the above uniform representation  , and ( c ) a general treatment of translation mismatches . 
In this paper , we propose a framework based on Situation Theory ( Barwise and Perry 1983 )  . First we will define the problem of translation mismatches  , the key translation problem in our view . Second we will define the situated representation of an utter-mace  . Third we will define our treatment of translation mismatches as a flow of information  ( Barwise and Etchemendy 1990 )  . At the end , we will discuss a translation example . 
2 What is a translation mismatch ?
Consider a simple bilingual text :
EXAMPLEI : BLOCKS ( an AI problem)

Consider the blocks world wiCh three blocks , A , B , and C . The blocks A and B are on the table . 
C is on A . Which blocks are clear ?
JAPAIIESE : mlt tunotumakiA to B to Cg ~ 6ru tumild no sek Liwo ~ ngaete three of block A and B and CNOM exist block of world ACC cons iderm/rutryAtotanotun ~ kihatnkuenoue A and B of block TOPICt & ble of & bore LOC rid ing 
ChlAmouennotteiru
CTOPICA of . bore LOC riding n&ni moue as not telnaitam/h ihl do tehnothin & above LOC riding block TOPIC which ? Note the translation pair C is on A and Ct~A  ~9 _h ~ j ~ - ~ w ~ ( Cha Ano . en in of teirn ) . In En-1 Such a reasoning-based MT system is one kind of " negotiation "- based system  , as proposed by Martin Kay . We thank him for stimulating our thinking . 
193 glish , the fact that C is on top of A is expressed using the preposition on and verb is  . In Japanese , the noun_1 = ( u e ) alone can mean either " on top of " above " , and there is no word meaning just " on top of " . Thus the Japanese translation arrows the relationship to the one that is needed by bringing in the verb j ~- ~  77 w  ~ ( not teirn ) ' riding ' . This phenomenon of the same information being attached to different morphological or syntactic forms in different languages ia well-recognized problem in translation  . 
TRANS LATION DIVERGENCES 2 of this kind manifest themselves at a particular epresentation level  . 
They can be handled by ( i ) STRUCTURE-TO-STRUCTURETRANS FERS , e . g . , structural transformations of Nagao (1987) , the sublanguage approach of Kosaka et al (1988) , or by ( ii ) TRANSFERVIAA"DEEPER"COMMONGROUND , e . g . , the entity-level of Carbonell and Tomita (1987) , the lexical-conceptual structure of Dorr (1990) . A solution of these types is not general enough to handle divergences at all levels  , however . More general approaches to divergences allow ( iii ) MULTI-LEVEL MAPPINGS , i . e . , direct transfer rules for mapping between different representation levels  , e . g . , structural correspondences of Kaplan et al .  (1989) , typed feature structure rewriting system of Zajac  ( 1989 )  , and abduction-based system of Hobbs and Kameyama ( 1990 )  . 
We want to call special attention to a less widely recognized problem  , that of TRANSLATION MISMATCHES . 
They are found when the grammar of one language does not make a distinction required by the grammar of the other language  . For instance , English noun phrases with COUNT type head nouns must specify information about definiteness and number  ( e . g . a town , the town , towns , and the towns are wellformed English noun phrases  , but not town ) . 
Whereas in Japanese , neither definiteness nor number information is obligatory  . Note the translation pair Which blocks are clear ? and f ~  %_h~77 W ~ W ~\] ~ Cg ~ ~? ~ ( Nanimone ninottein aitn miki hadoreka ) above . Blocks is plural , but tn miki has no number information . 
A mismatch as a predictabl effect in each translation direction  . From English into Japanese , the plurality information gets lost . From Japanese into English , on the other hand , the plurality information must be explicitly added  . 
Consider another example , a portion of step-by-step instructions for copying a file from a remote system to a local system : 
EXAMPLE2: FTP ~ Thlsterm was taken from Dorr ( 1990 ) where the problem of divergences in verb predicate-argument structures was treated  . Our use of the term extends the notion to cover a much more general phenomenon  . 
ENGLISH : 2 . Type'open ' , a space , and the name of the remote systems and press\[ return \]  . 
The system displays system connection messages and prompts for a user name  . 
3 . Type the user name for your account on the remote system and press\[return \]  . 
The system displays a message about passwords and prompts for a password if one is required  . 
JAPANESE : 2 . open ~1~~~--b'~':~- . a , ~: ~-' l' 7"b ~~--y~o'open'kuu hakurimoo tosisu temume two taipusi\[RETURN\]'open ' space remote system name ACC type and \[ RETURN \] slsntemn set nsoknmes sees i toynns a are el woton puron putosystem connection message and user name ACCash prompt gahyous is ~ reru

This information must be made explicit for each of these references in translating from Japanese into English whether or not it is decidable  . It gets lost ( at least on the surface ) in the reverse direction . 
Two important consequences for translation follow from the existence of major mismatches between languages  . First in translating a source language sentence , mismatches can force one to draw upon information ot expressed in the sentence information only inferrable from its context at best  . 
Secondly , mismatches may necessitate making information explicit which is only implicit in the source sentence or its context  . For instance , the alternation of viewpoint between user and system in the FTP example is implicit in the English text  , detectable only from the definiteness of noun phrases like " a / the user name " and " a pass word  , " but Japanese gramma requires an explicit choice of the user's viewpo into use the reflexive pronoun zibsn  . 
When we analyze what we called translation divergences above more closely  , it becomes clear that divergences are instances of lexical mismatches  . In the blocks example above , for instance , there is a mismatch between the spatial relations expressed with English on  , which implies contact , and Japanese pens that the verb " not teiru " can naturally resolve the mismatch within the sentence by adding the information " on top of "  . Divergences are thus lexical mismatches resolved within a sentence by coocurring lexemes  . This is probably the preferred method of mismatch resolution  , but it is not always possible . The mismatch problem is more dramatic when the linguistic resources of the target language offer no natural way to match up with the information content expressed in the source language  , as in the above example of definiteness and number  . This problem has not received adequate attention to our knowledge  , and no general solutions have been proposed in the literature  . 
Translation mismatches are thus a key translation problem that any MT system must face  . What are the requirements for an MT system from this perspective ? First  , mismatches must be made recognizable . Second , the system must allow relevant information from the discourse context be drawn upon as needed  . Third , it must allow implicit facts be made explicit as needed  . Are there any systematic ways to resolve mismatches at all levels ? What are the relevant parameters in the " context "? How can we control contextual parameters in the translation process ? Two crucial factors in an MT system are then REPRESENTATION and REASONING  . We will first describe our representation . 
3 Represent ing the t rans la t ion content and context Translation should preserve the information content of the source text  . This information has at least three major sources : Content  , Context , Language . 
From the content , we obtain a piece of information about the relevant world  . From the context , we obtain discourse-specific and utterance -specific information such as information about the speaker  , the addressee , and what is salient for them . From the linguistic forms ( i . e . , the particular words and structures ) , through shared cooperative strategies as well as linguistic conventions  , we get information about how the speaker intends the utterance to he interpreted  . 
DISTRIBUTIVE LAT TICE OF INF ONS .
In this approach , pieces of information , whether ? they come from linguistic or nonlinguistic sources  , are represented as infons ( Devl in 1990) . For an n-place relation P , (( P , Zl, .   .   .   , z , ; 1)) denotes the informational item , or infon , that zl ,   . . . , xnst and in the relation P , and (( P , Zl, .   .   .   , zn ; 0 ) ) denotes the infon that they do not stand in the relation  . Given a situations , and an infonor , s ~ ~ indicates that the infona is made factual by the situations  , reads supports ~ r . 
Infons are assumed to form a distributive lattice with least element  0  , greatest element 1 , set I of infons , and " involves " relation : ~ satisfying: 3 for infonscr and r , if s ~ cr and cr ~ r then s ~ 1-This distributive lattice ( I ,  =~) , together with a nonempty set Sit of situations and a relation ~ on SitxI constitute an infon algebra  ( see Barwise and
Etchemendy 1990).
THELINGUISTICINFONLATTICE . We propose to use in fonstouni formly represent information that come from multiple " levels " of linguistic abstraction  , e . g . , morphology , syntax , semantics , and pragmatics . Linguistic knowledge as a whole then forms a distributive lattice of infons  . 
For instance , the English words painting , drawing , and picture are associated with properties ; call them P1 , P2 , and P3 , respectively . In the following sublattice , a string in English ( EN ) or Japanese ( JA ) is linked to a property with the SIGNIFIES relation  ( written == )  , 4 and properties themselves are interlinked with the INVOLVES relation  ( =~ ) : EN:"picture " ~-= Pl (   ( picture , x ; 1))EN : " painting "= = P2((painting , x ; 1))
EN:"drawing"==P3((drawing,x;1))
EN:"oilpainting"=-----P4((oil painting , x ; 1~EN : " water-color "== Ph((water-color , x ; 1))
P2?>P1,P3~P1, P4=PP2,PS=PP2
So far the use of lattice appears no different from familiar semantic networks  . Two additional factors bring us to the basis for a general translation framework  . One is multilinguality . The knowledge of any new language can be added to the given lattice by inserting new infons in appropriate places and adding more instances of the " signifies " relations  . 
The other factor is grammatical nd discourse -functional notions  . Infons can be formed from any theoretical notions whether universal or language-specific  , and placed in the same lattice . 
Let us illustrate how the above " picture " sublat -tice for English would be extended to cover Japanese words for pictures  . In Japanese , ~( e ) includes both paintings and drawings , but not photographs . It is thus more specific than picture but more general than painting or drawing  . No Japanese words co-signify with painting or drawing  , but more specific concepts have words -- ~ ( aburae ) for P4 , ( suisaiga ) for P5 , and the rarely used word ~ ( sen byou ) for artists ' line drawings . Note that synonyms co-signify the same property  . ( See Figure 1 for the extended sublattice . )  3We assmne that the relation = ~ on infons is transitive  , reflexive , and antisymmetric after Barwise and Etchemendy . 
4 This is our addition to the infon lattice . The SIGNIFIES relation links the SIGNIFIER and SIGNIFIED to for rnaSIGN  ( de Saussure 1959 )  . Our notation abbreviates standard infons , e . g . , (( signifies , " picture ", EN , P1; 1)) .

For instance , corresponding to the English verb give , Japanese has six basic verbs of giving , whose distinctions hinge on the speaker's perspectivity and honorificity  . For " X gave Y to Z " with neutral honorificity , ager u has the viewpoint on X , and burets , the viewpoint on Z . SasiageruhonorsZ with the viewpoint on X , and l~udasaruhonorsX with the viewpoint on Z , and so on . See
Figure 2.
As an example of grammatical notions in the lattice  , take the syntactic features of noun phrases . 
English distinguishes six types according to the parameters of count/mass  , number , and definiteness , whereas Japanese noun phrases make no such syntactic distinctions  . See Figure 3 . Grammatical notions often draw on complex contextual properties such as " definiteness "  , whose precise definition is a research problem on its own  . 
THESITUATEDUTTERANCEREPRE-
SENTATION . A translation should preserve as far as practical the information carried by the source text or discourse  . Each utterance to be translated gives information about a situation being described -- precisely what information depends on the context in which the utterance is embedded  . We will utilize what we call a SITUATEDUTTERANCE REPRESEN-TATION  ( SUR ) to integrate the form , content , and ~ N~UN~:JA =; 0))
Figure 3: The " NP " Sublattice context of an utterance . 5 In translating , contextual information plays two key roles . One is to reduce the number of possible translations into the target language  . The other is to support reasoning to deal with translation mismatches  . 
Four situation types combine to define what an utterance is : Described Situation The way a certain piece of reality is  , according to the utterance Phrasal Situation The surface form of the utterance Discourse Situat i on The current state of the ongoing discourse when the utterance is produced Utterance Si tuation The specific situation where the utterance is produced The content of each utterance in a discourse like the Blocks and FTP examples is that some situation is described as being of a certain type  . This is the information that the utterance carries about the DESCRIBED SITUATION  . 
The PHRASAL SITUATION represents the surface form of an utterance  . The orthographic or phonetic , phonological , morphological , and syntactic aspects of an utterance are characterized here  . 
The DISCOURSESITUATION is expanded herein situation theory to characterize the dynamic aspect of discourse progression drawing on theories in computational discourse analysis  . It captures the linguistically significant parameters in the current state of the ongoing discourse  , s and is especially useful for finding functionally equivalent referring expressions between the source and target languages  . ? ? reference time = the time pivot of the linguistic SOur characterization of the context of utterance draws on a number of existing approaches to discourse represent a-tion and discourse processing  , most notably those of Grosz and Sidner (1986) , Discourse Representation Theory ( Kamp 1981 , Helm 1982) , Situation Semantics ( Barwise and Perry 1983 , Gawron and Peters 1990) , and Linguistic Discourse
Model ( Scha and Polanyi 1988).
? Lewis ( 1979 ) discussed a number of such parameters in a logical framework  . 
7 Different forms of referring expressions ( e . g . pronouns , demonstratives ) and surface structures ( i . e . syntactic and ? point of view = the individual from whose viewpoint a situation is described ~? attentional state -- the entities currently in the focus and center of attention ~? ? discourse structural context = where the utterance is in the structure of the current discourse Iz The specific UTTERANCESITUATION contains information about those parameters whose values up-port indexical references and deixes : e  . g . , information about the speaker , hearer(s ) , the time and location of the utterance , the perceptually salient context , etc . 
The FTP example text above describes a situation in which a person is typing commands to a computer and it is displaying various things  . Specifically , it describes the initial steps in copying a file from a remote system to a local system with ftp  . Consider the first utterance in instruction step ~ uttering  , x , u , t ; 1~^ ~ addressing ,  ~ , y , t ; 1Note that the parametery of DeS for the user ( to whom the discourse is addressed ) has its value constrained in US ; the same is true of the parameter t for utterance time  . Similarly , the parameter r of DeS for the definite remote system under discussion is assigned a definite value only by virtue of the information in DiS that it is the unique remote system that is salient at this point in the discourse  . 
This cross-referencing of parameters between types constitutes further support for combining all four situation types in a unified SUR  . In order for the analysis and generation of an utterance to be associated with an SUIt  , the grammar of a language should be a set of constraints on mappings among the values assigned to these parameters  .

10 See Grosz (1977) , Grosz et al (1983) , Kameyama (1986) , Brennan et al ( 1987 ) for discussions of this parameter . 
ll This parameter may be tied to the " intentional " aspect of discourse as proposed by Grosz and Sidner  ( 1986 )  . See , e . g . , Scha and Polanyi ( 1988 ) and Hobbs ( 1990 ) for discourse structure models . 
guage since languages differ in the concepts and realworld entities for which they have words and grammatical constructs  . 
In the cases where no translation with exactly the same meaning exists  , translator seek a target language text that accurately describes the same realworld situations as the source language text  .   12 The situation described by a text normally includes additional facts besides those the text explicitly states  . 
Human readers or listeners recognize these additional facts by knowing about constraints that hold in the real world  , and by getting collateral information about a situation from the context in which a description is given of it  . For a translation to be a good approximation to a source text  , its " fleshed out " set of facts -- the facts its sentences explicitly state plus the additional facts that these entail by known realworld constraints -- should be a maximal subset of the " fleshed out " source text facts  . 
Finding a translation with the desired property can be simplified by considering not sets of facts  ( infons ) but infon lattices ordered by involvement relations including known realworld constraints  . If a given infon is a fact holding in some situation  , all infons in such a lattice higher than the given one  ( i . e . , all further infons it involves ) must also be facts in the situation . Thus a good translation can be found by looking for the lowest infons in the lattice that the source text either explicitly or implicitly requires to hold in the described situation  , and finding a target language text that either explicitly or implicitly requires the maximal number  12In some special cases , translation requires mapping between different hut equivalent realworld situations  , e . g . , cars drive on different sides of the street in Japan and in the US  .

THE INFOR MATION FLO WG RAPH . Translation can be viewed as a flow of information that results from the interaction between the grammatical constraints of the source language  ( SL ) and those of the target language ( TL )  . This process can be best modelled with information flow graphs  ( IFG ) defined in Barwise and Etchemendy 1990 . An IFG is a semantic formalization of valid reasoning  , and is applicable to information that comes from a variety of sources  , not only linguistic but also visual and other sensory input  ( see Barwise and Etchemendy 1990b )  . By modelling a treatment of translation mismatches with IFGs  , we aim at a semantically correct definition that is open to various implementations  . 
IFGs represent five basic principles of information flow : Given Information present in the initial assumptions  , i . e . , an initial " open case . " Assume Given some open case , assume something extra , creating an open subcase of the given case . 
Subsume D is regard some open case if it is subsumed by other open cases  , any situation that supports the infons of the subsumed case supports those of one of the subsuming cases  . 
Merge Take the information common to a number of open cases  , and call it a new open case . 
Recognize as Possible Given some open case , recognize it as representing a genuine possibility  , provided the information present holds in some situation  . 
RESOLVING MIS MATCHES . First ~ a translation mismatch is recognized when the generation of a TL string is impossible from a given set of in-fons  . More specifically , given a Situated Utterance Representation ( SUIt )  , when no phrasal situations of TL support SUR because no string of TL signifies infonain SUR  , The TL grammar cannot generate a string from SUR , and there is a TRANSLATION MISMATCH on 0 r . 
A translation mismatch on ~ , above is resolved in one of two directions : Mismatch Resolution by Specification : Assume a specific caser such that r = : ~ and there is a Phrasal Situation of TL that supports v  . A new open case SUR ' is then generated , adding r to SUR . 
13As more sophisticated translation is required , We could make use of the multiple situation types to give more importance to some aspects of translation than others depending on the purpose of the text  ( see Hauenschild ( 1988 ) for such translaioneeds )  . 
This is the case when the Japanese word ~ ( e ) is translated into either painting or drawing in English  . 
The choice is constrained by what is known in the given context  . 
Mismatch Resolution by Generaliza-tion : Assume a general caser such that a = ~ r and there is a Phrasal Situation of TL that supports r  . A new open case SUR ' is then generated , adding 7-to SUR . 
This is the case when the Japanese word ~ ( e ) is translated in topic ture in English , or English wordsp painting and drawing are both translated into  ( e ) in Japanese . That is , two different utterances in English , I like this painting and I like this drawing , would both be translated into ~ J ~ l ' ~ Otl ~ ff ~ '~   ( watasi wak on oeg as ukides n ) in Japanese according to this scheme . 
Resolution by generalization is ordinarily less constrained than resolution by specification  , even though it can lose information . It should be blocked , however , when generalizing erases a key contrast from the content  . For example , given an English utterance , I like Matisse's drawings better than paintings , the translation into Japanese should not generalize both drawings and paintings into ~  ( e ) since that would lose the point of this utterance completely  . 
The mismatches must be resolved by specification i this case  , resulting in , for instance ,  $  J~1"~'?~"   4 gO~tt ~ e~A ~\]: 9 ~~ t ~ ~' t ? ' J " ( watasiwa Ma-tisseno abnraeyasnisai gayorimo sen by oug as ukidest  0 ' I like Matisse's line_drawings ( P7 ) better than oil_paintings ( P4 ) or water-colors ( P5 ) ' . 
There are IFGs for the two types of mismatch resolution  . Using of or an open ( unsubsumed ) node and ? for a subsumed node , we have the following : Mismatch Resolution by Specification :  ( given r : ~ a ) 
Given : oa Assume : ? a/6?, ~
Mismatch Resolution by Generalization : ( given o ": ? , ?) Given : oa Assume : la Subsume : la 6? , ? ~ q , TBoth resolution methods add more infons to the given SUR by ASSUMPTION  , but there is a difference . In resolution by specification , subsequent sub-surnption does not always follow . That is , only by contradicting other given facts , can some or all of the newly assumed SUR's later be subsumed  , and only by exhaustively generating all its subcases  , the original SUR can be subsumed . In resolution by generalization , however , the newly assumed general case immediately subsumes the original SUR  .   14   14Resolution by specification models a form of abductive inference  , and generalization , a form of deductive inference

THETRANS LATION MODEL . Here is our characterization faTRANS LATION :
Given a SUR(DeT , PS , Di S , US ) of the nth source text sentence and a discourse situation DiS " characterizing the target language text following translation of the  ( n-1 ) st source sentence , find a SUR ( DeT ' , PS  ~ , DiS ~ , US  ~ ) allowed by the target language grammar such that DiS "_C 
DiS ~ and ( DeT , PS , Di S , US ) , ~( DeTs , PSs , DiS ~ , US ') . 
( N is the approximates relation we have discussed , which constrains the flow of information in translation  . ) Our approach to translation combines SURs and IFGs  ( see Figure 4 )  . Each SUR for a possible interpretation of the source utterance undergoes a FLO WOFTRANS LATION as follows : A set of infons is initially GIVEN in an SUR  . It then grows by mismatch resolution processes that occur at multiple sites until a generation of a TL string is RECOGNIZE DASPOSSIBLE  . Each mismatch resolution involves AS-SUMING new SUR's and SUBSUMING inconsistent or superfluous SUR's  . ~s Our focus here is the epistemologic ai aspect of translation  , but there is a heuristically desirable property as well  . It is that the proposed mismatch resolution method uses only so much additional information as required to fill the particular distance between the given pair of linguistic systems  . That is , the more similar two languages , leas computation . This basic model should be combined with various control strategies such as default reasoning in a sltuation-theoretic context  . One way to implement these method si in the abduction-based system proposed by Hobbs and Kameyama  ( 1990 )  . 
~SA possible use of MERGE in this application is that two different SU it's may be merged when an identical TL string would be generated from them  .

5A translation example
We will now illustrate the proposed approach with a Japanese-to-English translation example : the first sentence of instruction step  3 in the FTP text . 
INPUTSTRING : "3 .  ~ -~'-- \]- ":/ . ~~' J-~'C'~'J ~' ff ) 7"~/~=---~~"7" L~~--y~9-o"1 . In the initial SUR are infons for 9 - ~ -- b " : I ~ ~" ( rimoo fosisutemu ) ' remote system ' , 7' ~ + Ii . ( akaunfo ) ' account ' , and :'---' ~( yu ~ zaamei ) ' username ' . All of these word signify properties that are signified by English COUNT nouns but the Japanese SUR lacks definiteness and number information  . 
2 . Generation of English from the SUR fails because , among other things , English grammar requires NPs with COUNT head nouns to be of the type  , Sg-Def , Sg-Indef , PI-Def , or Pl-Indef . 
( translation mismatch ) 3 . This mismatch cannot be resolved by generalization  . It is resolved by assuming four subcases for each nominal  , and subsuming those that are inconsistent with other given information  . The " remote system " is a singular entity in focus  , so it is Sg-Def , and the other three subcases are subsumed . The " username " is an entity in center , so Definite . The " account " is Definite despite its first mention because its possesser  ( addressee ) is definite . Both " user name " and " account " can be either Singular or Plural at this point  . Let's assume that a form of default reasoning comes into play here and concludes that a user has only one user name and one account name in each computer  . 
4 . The remaining open case permits generation of English noun phrases  , so the translation of this utterance is done . 
OUTPUTSTRING : " Type the user name for your account on the remote system and  . . . "  6 Conclusions In order to achieve high-quality translation  , we need a system that can reason about the context of utterances to solve the general problem of transla-framework based on Situation Theory that has this desired property  . The situated utterance representation of the source string embodies the contextual information required for adequate mismatch resolution  . The translation process has been modelled as a flow of information that responds to the needs of the target language grammar  . Reasoning across and beyond the linguistic levels  , this approach to translation respects and adapts to differences between languages  . 
7 Future implications
We plan to design our future implementation of an MT system in light of this work  . Computational studies of distributive lattices constrained by multiple situation types are needed  . Especially useful linguistic work would be on grammaticized contextual information  . More studies of the nature of translation mismatches are also extremely desirable  . 
The basic approach to translation proposed here can be combined with a variety of natural language processing frameworks  , e . g . , constraint logic , abduction , and connectionism . Translation systems for multimodal communication and those of multiple languages are among natural extensions of the present approach  .
