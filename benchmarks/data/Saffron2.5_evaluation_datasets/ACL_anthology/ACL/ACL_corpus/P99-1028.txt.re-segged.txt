This paper deals with translation ambiguity and target polysemy problems together  . Two monolingual balanced corpora are employed to learn word cooccurrence for translation ambiguity resolution  , and augmented translation restrictions for target polysemy resolution  . 
Experiments show that the model achieves 62 . 92% of monolingual information retrieval , and is 40 . 80% addition to the select-all model . 
Combining the target polysemy resolution , the retrieval performance is about 10 . 1 1% increase to the model resolving translation ambiguity only  . 
1. Introduction
Crosslanguage information retrieval ( CLIR )   ( Oard and Dorr , 1996; Oard ,  1997 ) deals with the use of queries in one language to access documents in another  . Due to the differences between source and target languages  , query translation is usually employed to unify the language in queries and documents  . In query translation , translation ambiguity is a basic problem to be resolved  . A word in a source query may have more than one sense  . Word sense disambiguation identifies the correct sense of each source word  , and lexical selection translates it into the corresponding target word  . 
The above procedure is similar to lexical choice operation in a traditional machine translation  ( MT ) system . However , there is a significant difference between the applications of MT and CLIR  . In MT , readers interpre the translated results . If the target word has more than one sense , readers can disambiguate its meaning automatically  . Comparatively , the translated result is sent to a monolingual information retrieval system in CLIR  . The target polysemy adds extraneous senses and affects the retrieval performance  . 
Some different approaches have been proposed for query translation  . Dictionary-based approach exploits machine -readable dictionaries and selection strategies like select all  ( Hull and Grefenstette , 1996; Davis ,  1997) , randomly select N ( Ballesteros and Croft , 1996; Kwok 1997) and select best N ( Hayashi , Kikui and Susaki , 1997; Davis 1997) . Corpusbased approaches exploit sentence-aligned corpora  ( Davis and Dunning ,  1996 ) and document-aligned corpora ( Sheridan and Ballerini ,  1996) . These two approaches are complementary . Dictionary provides translation candidates , and corpus provides context to fit user intention  . Coverage of dictionaries , alignment performance and domain shift of corpus are major problems of these two approaches  . Hybrid approaches ( Ballesteros and Croft , 1998; Bian and Chen ,  1998 ; Davis 1997 ) integrate both lexical and corpus knowledge . 
All the above approaches deal with the translation ambiguity problem in query translation  . 
Few touch on translation ambiguity and target polysemy together  . This paper will study the multiplication effects of translation ambiguity and target polysemy in cross-language information retrieval systems  , and propose a new translation method to resolve these problems  . Section 2 shows the effects of translation ambiguity and target polysemy in ChineseEnglish and EnglishChinese information retrievals  . Section 3 presents several models to revolve translation ambiguity and target polysemy problems  . 
Section 4 demonstrates the experimental results , and compares the performances of the proposed models  . Section 5 concludes the remarks . 
2. Effects of Ambiguities
Translation ambiguity and target polysemy are two major problems in CLIR  . Translation ambiguity results from the source language  , and target polysemy occurs in target language . Take ChineseEnglish information retrieval ( CEIR ) and EnglishChinese information retrieval ( ECIR ) as examples . The former uses Chinese queries to

To explore the difficulties in the query translation of different languages  , we gather the sense statistics of English and Chinese words  . 
Table 1 shows the degree of word sense ambiguity ( in terms of number of senses ) in English and in Chinese , respectively . A Chinese thesaurus , i . e . , ~~$~ k ( tong2yi4ci2ci21in2) , ( Mei , et al , 1982) and an English thesaurus , i . e . , Roget's thesaurus , are used to count the statistics of the senses of words  . On the average , an English word has 1 . 687 senses , and a Chinese word has 1 . 397 senses . If the top 1000 high frequent words are considered , the English words have 3 . 527 senses , and the bi-character Chinese words only have 1 . 504 senses . In summary , Chinese word is comparatively unambiguous , so that translation ambiguity is not serious but target polysemy is serious in CEIR  . In contrast , an English word is usually ambiguous . The translation disambiguation is important in ECIR  . 
Consider an example in CEIR . The Chinese word " , ~ , It "( y in 2 hang 2) is unambiguous , but its English translation " bank " has 9 senses ( Longman ,  1978) . When the Chinese word " , ~45-"( yin2hang2) is issued , it is translated into the English counterpart " bank " by dictionary lookup without difficulty  , and then " bank " is sento an IR system . The IR system will retrieve documents that contain this word  . Because " bank " is not disambiguated , irrelevant documents will be reported . On the contrary , when " bank " is submitted to an ECIR system , we must disambiguate its meaning at first . If we can find that its correct ranslation is "- ~   g-#5""   ( y in 2 hang2 )  , the subsequent operation is very simple . That is , " ~'~5-"( yin2hang2) is sent into an IR system , and then documents containing "~ l ~5"" ( y in 2 hang2 ) will be presented . In this example , translation disambiguation should be done rather than target polysemy resolution  . 
The above examples do not mean translation disambiguation is not required in CEIR  . Some Chinese words may have more than one sense . 
For example , "k -~~" ( yun 4 dong 4 ) has the following meanings ( Lai and Lin , 1987): (1) sport , (2) exercise , (3) movement , (4) motion , (5) campaign , and (6) lobby . Each corresponding English word may have more than one sense  . 
For example , " exercise " may mean a question or set of questions to be answered by a pupil for practice  ; the use of a power or right ; and so on . 
The multiplication effects of translation ambiguity and target polysemy make query translation harder  . 
3. Translation Ambiguity and Polysemy
Resolution Models
In the recent works , Ballesteros and Croft (1998) , and Bian and Chen ( 1998 ) employ dictionaries and cooccurrence statistics trained from target language documents to deal with translation ambiguity  . We will follow our previous work ( Bian and Chen ,  1998) , which combines the dictionary-based and corpus -based approaches for CEIR  . A bilingual dictionary provides the translation equivalents of each query term  , and the word cooccurrence information trained from a target language text collection is used to disambiguate the translation  . This method considers the content around the translation equivalents to decide the best target word  . The translation of a query term can be disambiguated using the cooccurrence of the translation equivalents of this term and other terms  . We adopt mutual information ( Church , et al . , 1989) to measure the strength . This disambiguation method performs good translations even when the multiterm phrases are not found in the bilingual dictionary  , or the phrases are not identified in the source language  . 
Before discussion , we take ChineseEnglish information retrieval as an example to explain our methods  . Consider the Chinese query " , ~I ~' ~5-" ( y in 2 hang2 ) to an English collection again . The ambiguity grows from none ( source side ) to 9 senses ( target side ) during query translation . 
How to incorporate the knowledge from source side to target side is an important issue  . To avoid the problem of target polysemy in query word by augmenting some other words that usually cooccur with it  . That is , we have to make a context for the target word . In our method , the contextual information is derived from the source word  . 
We collect the frequently accompanying nouns and verbs for each word in a Chinese corpus  . 
Those words that cooccur with a given word within a window are selected  . The word association strength of a word and its accompanying words is measured by mutual information  . For each word C in a Chinese query , we augment i with a sequence of Chinese words trained in the above way  . Let these words be CW~,CW2, . . . , and CWm . Assume the corresponding English translations of C  , CW  ~ , CW 2 ,   . . . , and CWmare E , EW ,, EW2, . . . , and EWm , respectively . EW e , EW2, . . . , and EWm form an augmented translation restriction of E for C  . In other words , the list ( E , EW1, EW2, . . . , EWm ) is called an augmented translation result for C . 
EW e , EW e, . . . , and EWm are a pseudo English context produced from Chinese side  . Consider the Chinese word " ~ I~g S ""( y in 2 hang2) . Some strongly corelated Chinese words in ROCLING balanced corpus  ( Huang , et al , 1995) are : " I ! . g . ~, " ( tie1xian4), " ~~ ~" ( ling3chu1),"_-~_ . ~"( li3ang2) , " ~1~" ( yalhui4) , "; ~~" ( hui4dui4) , etc . Thus the augmented translation restriction of " bank " is  ( rebate , show out , Lyons , negotiate , transfer ,   . . . ) . 
Unfortunately , the query translation is not so simple . A word C in a query Q may be ambiguous . Besides , the accompanying words CW ~ ( 1 < i < m ) trained from Chinese corpus may be translated into more than one English word  . 
An augmented translation restriction may add erroneous patterns when a word in a restriction has more than one sense  . Thus we devise several models to discuss the effects of augmented restrictions  . Figure 1 shows the different models and the model refinement procedure  . A Chinese query may go through translation ambiguity resolution module  ( left-to-right )  , target polysemy resolution module ( topdown ) , or both ( i . e . , these two modules are integrated at the right corner  )  . 
In the following , we will show how each module is operated independently  , and how the two modules are combined . 
For a Chinese query which is composed of n words C  ~  , C2 ,   . . . , Ca , find the corresponding English translation equivalents in a ChineseEnglish bilingual dictionary  . To discuss the propagation errors from translation ambiguity resolution part in the experiments  , we consider the following two alternatives : ( a ) select all ( do-nothing ) The strategy does nothing on the translation disambiguation  . All the English translation equivalents for then Chinese words are selected  , and are submitted to a monolingual information retrieval system  . 
( b ) cooccurrence model ( Co-Model )
We adopt the strategy discussed previously for translation disambiguation  ( Bian and Chen ,  1998) . This method considers the content around the English translation equivalents to decide the best target equivalent  . 
For target polysemy resolution part in Figure 1 , we also consider two alternatives . In the first alternative ( called A model ) , we augment restrictions to all the words no matter whether they are ambiguous or not  . In the second alternative ( called U model ) , we neglec those Cs that have more than one English translation  . 
Assume Co ~), C~2) . . . .  , Co~p )   ( p < n ) have only one English translation . The restrictions are augmented to Co ~), C~2) . . . . . Co~p ) only . We apply the above corpus-based method to find the restriction for each English word selected by the translation ambiguity resolution model  . Recall that the restrictions are derived from Chinese corpus  . The accompanying words trained from Chinese corpus may be translated into more than one English word  . Here , the translation ambiguity may occur when translating the restrictions  . Three alternatives are considered . 
In U1 ( or A1) model , the terms without ambiguity , i . e . , Chinese and English words are one-to-one correspondent in a ChineseEnglish bilingual dictionary  , are added . In UT ( or AT ) model , th / ~ terms with the same parts of speech ( POSes ) are added . That is , POS is used to select English word . In UTT ( or ATT ) model , we use mutual information to selectop 10 accompanying terms of a Chinese query word , and POS is used to obtain the augmented translation restriction  .

Figure 1 . Models for Translation Ambiguity and Target Polysemy Resolution In the above treatment  , a word C ~ in a query Q is translated into ( Ei , E Wil , EW i2 .   .   .   . , EWimi ) . Ei is selected by Co-Model , and EWi ~, EWi2 .   .   .   .   , E Wimi are augmented by different target polysemy resolution models  . Intuitively , Ei , E Wil , EWi2 . .  .   . , EWim ~ should have different weights . E i is assigned a higher weight , and the words EW il , EW i2 . . . . . Eim ~ in the restriction are assigned lower weights  . They are determined by the following formula , where n is number of words in Q and m k is the number of words in a restriction for Ek  . 
1 weight ( Ei)-n+l(n+1) * Emkk = l
Thus six new models , i . e . , A1W , ATW , ATTW , U1W , UTW and UTTW , are derived . Finally , we apply Co-model again to disambiguate the pseudo contexts and devise six new models  ( A1WCO , ATWCO , ATTWCO , U1WCO , UT WCO , and UTTWCO ) . In these six models , only one restriction word will be selected from the words EW il  , E Wiz ,   . . . , E Wimivia disambiguation with othe restrictions . 
4. Experimental Results
To evaluate the above models , we employ
TREC6 text collection , TREC topics 301-350 ( Harman ,  1997) , and Smart information retrieval system ( Salton and Buckley ,  1988) . The text collection contains 556 , 077 documents , and is about 2 . 2G bytes . Because the goal is to evaluate the performance of ChineseEnglish information retrieval on different models  , we translate the 50 English queries into Chinese by human . The topic 332 is considered as an example in the following . The original English version and the human -translated Chinese version are shown  . ATREC topic is composed of several fields . Tags < num > , < title > , < des > , and < narr > denote topic number , title , description , and narrative fields . Narrative provides a complete description of document relevance for the title and description are used to generate queries  . 
< top > < num > Number : 332 < title > Income TaxEvasion < desc > Description : This query is looking for investigations that have targeted evaders of U  . S . income tax . 
< narr > Narrative:
A relevant document would mention investigations either in the U  . S . or a broad of people suspected of evading U . S . income taxlaws . Of particular interest are investigations involving revenue from illegal activities  , as a strategy to bring known or suspected criminals to justice  . 
</ top > < top > < num > Number : 332 < C-title > < C-desc > Description : < C-narr > Narrative:  . ~l ~ ~ . & . ~-~-?:~, J -~, ~~~~-~~ ~ . ~-~  , </ top > Totally , there are 1 , 017 words ( 557 distinct words ) in the title and description fields of the 50 translated TREC topics . Among these ,   401 words have unique translations and 616 words have multiple translation equivalents in our ChineseEnglish bilingual dictionary  . Table 2 shows the degree of word sense ambiguity in English and in Chinese  , respectively . On the average , an English query term has 2 . 976 senses , and a Chinese query term has 1 . 828 senses only . 
In our experiments , LOB corpus is employed to train the cooccurrence statistics for translation ambiguity resolution  , and ROCLING balanced corpus ( Huang , et al ,  1995 ) is employed to train the restrictions for target polysemy resolution  . 
The mutual information tables are trained using a window size  3 for adjacent words . 
Table 3 shows the query translation of TREC topic 332  . For the sake of space , only title field is shown . In Table 3(a ) , the first two rows list the original English query and the Chinese query  . 
Rows 3 and 4 demonstrate the English translation by select-all model and cooccurrence model by resolving translation ambiguity only  . Table 3 ( b ) shows the augmented translation results using different models  . Here , both translation ambiguity and target polysemy are resolved  . 
The following lists the selected restrictions in A1 model . 
i ~_ ~ ( evasion ) : ~ . ~_N(N : poundage ), ~/ t ~_N ( N : scot ), ~ . tkV ( V : stay )  ?~- ( income ) : I~g ~_ N ( N : quota )  ~ ( tax ) : i / ~_ V ( N : evasion )  , I ~_ N ( N : surtax) , ~ t  ~ , _N(N:surplus ) ,   , g ' ~_ N ( N : salestax ) Augmented translation restrictions ( poundage , scot , stay ) , ( quota ) , and ( evasion , surtax , surplus , salestax ) are added to " evasion " , " income " , and " tax " , respectively . From Longman dictionary , we know there are 3 senses , 1 sense , and 2 senses for " evasion " , " income " , and " tax " , respectively . 
Augmented restrictions are used to deal with target polysemy problem  . Compared with A1 model , only " evasion " is augmented with a translation restriction in  U1 model . This is because ""~~" ( tao21uo4 ) has only one translation and "?~-" ( suo3 de2 ) and " ~" ( sui4 ) have more than one translation . Similarly , the augmented translation restrictions are omitted in the other U-models  . Now we consider AT model . The Chinese restrictions , which have the matching POSes , are listed below : i ~ ( evasion ) : ~_N ( N : poundage )  , ~l~t ~0 ~ , _N(N:scot ) , L ~_ V ( V : stay) , ~ N(N : droit , duty , geld , tax ) , li~l~f ~ N(N : custom , douane , tariff ) ,  /~ . ~ V(V : avoid , elude , wangle , welch , welsh ; N : avoidance , elusion , evasion , evasiveness , miss , run around , shirk , skulk ) , i . ~) ~_ V ( V : contravene , in fract , infringe ; N : contravention , infraction , infringement , sin , violation ) ~"~-( income ): ~_V(V : impose ; N : division ) ,  ~ . &~ , _V(V : assess , put , tax;N : imposition , taxation ) , ~ A ~_ N(N : Swiss , Switzer ) , i ~_ V ( V : minus , subtract ) , I ~ I\[$~_N(N:quota) , I ~ l ~_ N ( N : common wealth , folk , l and , nation , nationality , son , subject ) ( tax ): I~h~_N ( N : surtax ) ,   . ~ t  ~ g , N(N : surplus ) , ~' ~_N ( N : salestax) , g ~ V ( V : a base , alight , debase , descend ) , r ~_ N ( N : altitude , loftiness , tallness ; ADJ : high ; ADV : l of tily ) , ~ V(V : comprise , comprize , embrace , ncompass ) , - ~ V(V : compete , mulate , vie ; N : conflict , contention , duel , strife ) Table 2 .

For example , the translation of "~"_V ( tao2bi4 ) has two possible POSes , i . e . , V and N , so only " avoid " , " elude " , " wangle " , " welch " , and " welsh " are chosen . The other terms are added in the similar way . Recall that we use mutual information to select the top  10 accompanying terms of a Chinese query term in ATT model  . 
The 5 ~ row shows that the augmented translation restrictions for "?  ) i " ~-" ( suo3 de2 ) and " ~ , "  ( sui4 ) are removed because their top 10 Chinese accompanying terms do not have English translations of the same POSes  . Finally , we consider ATWCO model . The words " tax " , " l and " , and " surtax " are selected from the three lists in  3 rd row of Table 3  ( b ) respectively , by using word cooccurrences . 
Figure 2 shows the number of relevant documents on the top  1000 retrieved documents for Topics 332 and 337  . The performances are stable in all of the + weight  ( W ) models and the enhanced CO restriction ( WCO ) models , even there are different number of words in translation restrictions  . Especially , the enhanced CO restriction models add at most one translated restriction word for each query tenn  . They can achieve the similar performance to those models that add more translated restriction words  . 
Surprisingly , the augmented translation results may perform better than the monolingual retrieval  . 
Topic 337 in Figure 2 is an example.
Table 4 shows the overall performance of 18 different models for 50 topics . Eleven-point average precision on the top 1000 retrieved documents i adopted to measure the performance of all the experiments  . The monolingual information retrieval , i . e . , the original English queries to English text collection  , is regarded as a baseline model . The performance is 0 . 1459 under the specified environment . The select-all model , i . e . , all the translation equivalents are passed without disambiguation  , has 0 . 0652 average precision . About 44 . 6 9% of the performance of the monolingual information retrieval is achieved  . When cooccurrence model is employed to resolve translation ambiguity  ,  0 . 083 1 average precision (56 . 96% of monolingual information retrieval ) is reported . 
Compared to do-nothing model , the performance is 27 . 45% increase . 
Now we consider the treatment of translation ambiguity and target polysemy together  . 
Augmented restrictions are formed in A1 , AT , ATT , U 1 , UT and UTT models , however , their performances are worse than Co-model ( translation disambiguation only )  .

That can be found from the fact that models U1 , UT , and UTT are better than A1 , AT , and ATT . 
Because the translation of restriction from source language  ( Chinese ) to target language ( English ) has the translation ambiguity problem , the models ( U1 and A1 ) introduce the unambiguous restriction terms and perform better than other models  . Controlled augmentation shows higher performance than uncontrolled augmentation  . 
When different weights are assigned to the original English translation and the augmented restrictions  , all the models are improved significantly . The performances of A1W,ATW,
ATTW , U1W , UTW , and UTTW are about 10 . 1 1% addition to the model for translation disambiguation only  . Of these models , the performance change from model AT to model ATW is drastic  , i . e . , from 0 . 0419 (28 . 72%) to 0 . 0913 (62 . 58%) . It tells us the original English translation plays a major role  , but the augmented restriction still has a significant effect on the performance  . 
We know that restriction for each English translation presents a pseudoEnglish context  . 
Thus we apply the cooccurrence model again on the pseudoEnglish contexts  . The performances are increased a little . These models add at most one translated restriction word for each query term  , but their performances are better than those models that adding more translated restriction words  . It tells us that a good translated restriction word for each query term is enough for resolving target polysemy problem  . U1WCO , which is the best in these experiments , gains 62 . 92% of monolingual information retrieval , and 40 . 80% increase to the do-nothing model ( select-all ) . 
2215. Concluding Remarks
This paper deals with translation ambiguity and target polysemy at the same time  . We utilize two monolingual balanced corpora to learn useful statistical data  , i . e . , word cooccurrence for translation ambiguity resolution  , and translation restrictions for target polysemy resolution  . 
Aligned bilingual corpus or special domain corpus is not required in this design  . Experiment show that resolving both translation ambiguity and target polysemy gains about  10  . 1 1% performance addition to the method for translation disambiguation in cross-language information retrieval  . We also analyze the two factors : word sense ambiguity in source language  ( translation ambiguity )  , and word sense ambiguity in target language ( target polysemy )  . The statistics of word sense ambiguities have shown that target polysemy resolution is critical in ChineseEnglish information retrieval  . 
This treatment is very suitable to translate very short query on Web  , The queries on Web are 1 . 5-2 words on the average ( Pinkert on , 1994; Fitzpatrick and Dent ,  1997) . Because the major components of queries are nouns  , at least one word of a short query of length 1 . 5-2 words is noun . Besides , most of the Chinese nouns are unambiguous , so that translation ambiguity is not serious comparatively  , but target polysemy is critical in ChineseEnglish Web retrieval  . The translation restrictions , which introduce pseudo contexts , are helpful for target polysemy resolution . The applications of this method to cross-language Internet searching  , the applicability of this method to other language pairs  , and the effects of humancomputer interaction on resolving translation ambiguity and target polysemy will be studied in the future  .
