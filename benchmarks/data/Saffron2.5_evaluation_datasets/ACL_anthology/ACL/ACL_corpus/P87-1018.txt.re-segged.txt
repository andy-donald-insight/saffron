Japanese has many noun phrase patterns of the type A no B consisting of two nouns A and B with an adnominal particle no  . As the semantic relations between the two nouns in the noun phrase are not made explicit  , the interpretation of the phrases depends mainly on the semantic characteristics of the nouns  . 
This paper describes the semantic diversity of A no B and a method of semantic analysis for such phrases based on feature unification  . 
1. Introduction
Japanese has many noun phrase patterns of the type Ano B  . The noun phrase pattern , which consists of two nouns A and B with an adnominal particle no  , and which has at least the same ambiguity as B of A  ( and some additional ambiguities not found with the equivalent English construction  )  , does not express any explicit semantic relations between the two nouns  . 
Consequently , its interpretation depends mainly on the semantic characteristics of the nouns  . Furthermore , phrase patterns NI no N2 no . . . no Nn often appear . Because the number of possible dependencies between the constituents is  2 "' I ( 2n-3 ) l!/n ! , semantic analysis of such phrases is necessary to resolve the ambiguities  . To date , there have been no adequate analyses for this linguistic phenomenon  , nor have there been any clear methodological proposals for its semantic analysis  . 
This paper describes a ) the semantic diversity of AnoB , b ) the analysis of the semantic structure for AnoB by a unification-based method of semantic function application  , c ) typical semantic structures of AnoB , d ) the possibility of paraphrasing A no B as a noun phrase with a relative clause by the addition of a verb  , and e ) the resolution of ambiguities using contextual information from the viewpoint of relation between AnoB and its corresponding relative clause  . 
Although A no B is a simple fo ~ n , it is interesting in two respects . First , A no B represents a general linguistic problem for semantic processing  . The reason is that , in some cases , A or B is a noun form derived from a verb or adjective  , thus necessitating the semantic processing of verbs and adjectives  . Second , A no B can be paraphrased as a noun phrase with a relative clause  , in just the same way as some English complex nominals  \[3  ,  5\] . Putting it another way , as information is condensed into a simple expression  , there are ambiguities as to the semantic relations between the two nouns  . Consequently , contextual analysis plays a crucial part in the resolution of the ambiguities  . 
2. Semantic Diversity of Ano B
A no B is frequently found in Japanese sentences.
An exsmlnation of scientific and newspaper articles showed that the occurrence of AnoB accounts for about half the total number of noun phrases in a text ill \]  . The other occurrences are noun phrases with relative clauses  , and coordinated noun phrases . In constructions of the type A no B , A or B can represent either a simple noun , as in Taroonoie (" raro's house ") , NP of the same A no B pattern , a sinkari for unian oshutono jinko ( " the population of the capital of California " )  , or NP with a relative clause , as in Watashiga attahiton on a ( " the name of the person who I met " )  . There is also a fourth pattern involving an additional particle such as kara  , made , de and so on , as in Tookyookarano densha ( " the train from Tokyo " )  . This paper deals mainly with constructions of the first type  , though the method presented here is also applicable recursively to patterns of the second and third types : this is possible because in such constructions  , the semantic features of A(i . e . X no Y , or SY ) derive from its head(Y ) . In the fourth type , analysis is slightly less straightforward , because the particle does provide some additional useful information  . 
A no modifies ahead B to restrictor clarify the reference t l  . 21 of B . In the example Sutan food odaigaku nok yooju ( " professor at Stanford University " )  , Sutan-food odaigaku ( " Stanford University " ) restricts and clarifies the range of reference for kyooju  ( " professor " )  . 
Such A no B constructions can be classified semantically into five main groups according to the characteristics of A and B  , as shown in Table 1 . The five main groups can be further classified into a total of about  80 semantic relations . In the studymentioned above \[ III , the authors examined about ten thousand examples of AnoBoccurrences  , and checked the semantic relations . 
The appendix shows the semantic relations together with examples  . It is necessary to analyze these seman-1 . B functions as a predicate semantically , and A is its argument .

B : k i (~, " Wee')... object,
A : kooen(~\[\]," park ") . . . value of an object's attribute location tic relations in such detail in order to produce good quality machine translation from Japanese into Eng-Lish among other tasks  . To date , linguistic processing has not entailed such a detailed classification  . 
The semantic structure of AnoB is generally a function of the meanings of A and B  , but the processing is not just a simple computation based on the semantic contents of A and B  . For instance , when B functions as a predicate semantically , there is a case relation between A and B . However , there are no syntactic clues such as a case particle  , unlike in full sentences . 
Hence , it is necessary to consider the semantic characteristics of A and B in order to analyze the semantic structure  . 
Processing of context \[12\] is generally necessary to determine the correct semantic structure of AnoBuniquely  , as A no B is often ambiguous if considered out of context  . For instance , in the case of Ft ~ ransuj in no hanashi ( " speech of a Frenchman " )  , there are two possible semantic relations for Furansujin  ( " French-man " ) : i . e . as agent or content of hanashi (" speech ") . 
3 . Semantic Structure Analysis of AnoB 3 . 1 Analysis by Function Application The semantic structure of AnoB is generally analyzed from A and B by " semantic function application "  , which is similar to the idea of function application in the CUG framework  ( categorial unification grammar )  14 . za \] , viewing either A or B as a functor , and the other as its argument . 
(functor left/right )  =  ( argument )   ( functor result )  =  ( semantic-structure ) From a different viewpoint , this is a generalization of the method of case frame analysis in which the analysis of the semantic structure of a verb-plus-noun phrase is based on the case frame of the verb  . That is , when a verb as a functor is applied to a noun phrase as its argument  , if the noun phrase and a slot of the case frame unify  , the semantic structure is obtained as a result of assigning the relevant information from the noun phrase to the slot-So  , the analysis is a kind of semantic treatment using the unification-based method  . In this view , the case frames correspond to subcategorization frames  , and the analysis corresponds to unifications applied to a subcategorization frame Is  , s\]Characteristics of the function-based analysis are mainly to express input-output relations clearly  , and to put stress on a lexical-based method . 
As the meaning of AnoB depends on the individual A and B  , it follows that each lexical entry must have information regarding its " functionality "  . This is also the method adopted in CUG . Furthermore , these functors , arguments , and resulting semantic structures are represented assets of  at1~ribute-value pairs , again as in CUG . This is also similar to frame representations found in AI  . The set of attribute-value pairs associated with a functor noun and an argument noun are generally represented as in Figure  1  , and will be called a " semantic structure " . The characteristics of these structures are described in Section  3  . 3 . In the representation , the attributes left and right indicate an argument for a functor word and a position  ( direction )  , and the values represent conditions imposed on the argument  . Syncat , semcat and sense indicate syntactic , semantic and head word meaning respectively . 
Marker indicates the case particle found as a post -posi-tion with the noun phrase  . Pred gives semantic conditions which restrict and clarify the relation between Asyncat : < syntact ic  . features :> semcat ~< semar Uic-feo Jures : > sense : < word  . senae > marker . < c~e-partic\[e :> leR:NONE right:syncat : < ~ syntactic  . features > semcat : < semantic-features > sense :\[\] pred:<cuae  . rmme >: syncat: ( syncat ) semcat : ( semcac ) sense : ( sense ) case : < syntactic-cc~se-name :> marker : ( marker ) result : syncat:<:syntactic-\[eatures ~> semcat : < semarutic-features > sense : < word -senae marker :\[\] pred:  ( right pred ) Figure la Format for a functor noun having an argument at its right semcat:sense:marker : left:right:pred:<syntactic-features > < semantic-features > < word sense > < case  . particle >

3 . 2 Semant ic S t ruc ture Ana lys i s o f A no B The noun phrase A no B is regarded as a composition of A no and B  . Therefore , A no B is composed of Ano and B by the function role of either Anoor B  . Which of Anoor B has a function role depends on syntactic and semantic characteristic as described in section  3  . 3 . 
Then Ano is regarded as being constructed from A and no  . Accordingly , the semantic structure of AnoB is analyzed as follows : First  , the functor no gets argument A , and makes a noun phrase Ano with the semantic characteristics inherited from A  . Secondly , the functor Anoor B gets an argument Bor Ano respectively and makes a noun phrase AnoB with the semantic characteristics inherited from B  . The analysis process is shown as follows . 
(1) functor : no , argument : A , result : A no (2) functor : A no , argument : B , result : A no B , or functor : B , argument : Ano , result : A no BIn the case of Ap no B ( where p is an additional particle )  , A and p are combined first . The semantic structure of Ap is almost the same as that of Ano except for the additional information derived from the marker p  . 
After this , the final semantic structure is composed in the same way as for AnoB  . This paper focuses mainly on the analysis process after constituents of A no B have been found  , and does not pay specific attention to the method of how constituents are found  , for which purpose the active chart parsing method is used  . 
With regard to the composition of Ano , we take the choice giving no the functor role from the viewpoint of generality  , although it is possible to view A as having this role  . No has a functor role that shifts characteristics and functions of A to the semantic structure of A no  , and adds a marker feature to the semantic structure of Ano  . The representation of no is shown in Figure 2 . 
In the analysis of AnoB , the semantic characteristics and functions of A and B weigh heavily  , because although there is an adnominal case particle no  , it is semantically rather neutral compared with other case particles  . To put it another way , case particles usually function as explicit indicators of the preferred semantic interpretation  . This fact suggests the significance of studying the method of analysis of AnoB  . 
When Ano has a functor role , the functor must get B as its argument and extract a semantic relation between A and B  . For example , inguruu punoshuukai (" meeting of a group ") , guru upu no modifies an action nominal and makes a result semantic structure indicating the semantic relation  ( agent ) as in Figure 3 . 
In the representation > pred indicates a constraint that an argument must have a pred feature  . 
The main semantic category of AnoB is generally taken from the head B of Ano " B  . However , in some cases the semantics of B are different from those of AnoB  , and it is necessary to change the semantic cate -syncat:psense:no  ( c )  , no ) left:syncat:nnpsemcat:\[\]sense:\[\] marker : no left:NONE right:\[\] result :\[\ ] right:NONE result : syncat:npsemcat:  ( left semcat ) sense : ( left sense ) marker : no left : NONE right : ( left right ) result : ( left result )

For example , heita , "(" soldier ") is animate , but or aock an oheitai (" toy soldier ") is not . ThereforeomocA ano has the function of changing the semantic category of the head which it modifies  . Such a function is obtained by a kind of over writing unification  19!   3  . 3 Semantic Structures in Five Main Groups The characteristics of the semantic structures in the f ~ vema/ngroups are as follows  . 
\[ Case1\]In this case , B , which is the nominal form of a predicate ( a verb or an adjective )  , functions as a nar~ument ~ and A , which is a semanticase argument of B , functions as a functor . Notice that when B functions semantically as a predicate  , there are two alternatives for the assignment of the functor role  . The first is that the predicate word functions as the functor  . 
The second is the reverse L41 . This paper adopts the latter way mainly because of the characteristic of free word order in a Japanese sentence  . 
The semantic structure of A and Arw is almost the same except for a marker feature  , and has the following functor role : when A no is an obligatory case  ( argument ) of the predicate B , A nounifies with the argument feature of " B . When A no is an optional case ( adjunct ) , the semantic structure of Ano is added to that of B as an optional case by unification  . The functor role is added to A by a kind of lexical rule  . Ez~mples are shown in Figures 3 and 4 . 
\[ Case 2 and Case 3\] In these cases , B represents a kind of case role or attribute respectively  , which functions as a predicate . So , functionality is given to A in the same way as described above  . Examples are shown in Figures 5 and 6 . 
\[ Case 4\] The reverse case of Case 1 , that is , A is the nominal Form of " a predicate , and B is the semanticase element of the predicate  . SoB is a functor and Anois its argument in the reverse way  . The example is shown in Figure 7 . Kooen ( " park " ) in the example gets an argument in the opposite direction to that of example  4  . 
The phrase in this case corresponds to a noun phrase with a relative clause  . So , a feature embedded is used in the representation , that is , it means that the pred feature is introduced from the complement  . 
\[ Case 5\] Semantic relations in this case are classified mainly into three types : a  ) relational restriction such as a human relation , b ) attributive restrict/on such as a kind relation and c  ) situational restriction such as a location relation  . 
( a ) relational restr/ction : This case includes the relationships between humans  , organizations , and whole-part relations . Generally a predicate role is given to B and a functo role is given to A in the same way as Case  1  . An example is shown in Figure 8 . In the example , sensei ( " teacher " ) has a pred feature and is an argument of the functor wat as A ~  ( ' I " )  . 
( b ) attributive restriction : A has attributive characteristics such as quantity  , kind , degree , and property , and B is generally a thing . As A functions as a kind of pred-"i cate , a predicate feature is assigned to A . An example is shown in Figure 9 with kooshifimar ~ on , ,no Ccheck-ered-pattern cloth ") , where kooshijurna has a pred feature and is an argument of the functor ~  , , no (" cloth") . 
( c ) situational restriction : A has situational meanings such as location  , time , source , destination , purpose , and method , and restricts B by the situation . Like the relational restriction case , B is assigned a predicate feature , and A a functo role as shown in Figure 10 . In the example , doozoo ( " or onze statue " ) has a pred feature and is an argument of the functor kooen  ( " park " )  .

Therefore , A or B generally has both roles of a predicate and a modifier  .

Thus , the middle noun ( B ) may relate to the words on either side ( A and C )  , or to only the right hand word ( C ) . In the ~ rst case , the middle noun may be an argument of the predicate on both sides  . In the latter case , the right , hOSt word C may be an argtunent of each predicate to the left  , the number of which is not in general restricted . 
c ) There are two cases of ( Ano(BnoC )) . When C is a nominal predicate , A and B might be separate arg~nents as in Kinoo no Taroono Sanpo  ( " raro's walk of yesterday " )  . When C is an ordinary noun , however , the analysis is further complicated by the fact that implicit predicates such as location  , possession , attribution etc . , are involved , For example , in Tookyoon o NT Tnobiru ( ' ~ rrr's building in Tokyo " )  , the inner predicate structure for NTT no bits ( "NTT has a building " ) is attached to the appropriate argument of the outer predicate Tookyoonobiru 
C building is in Tokyo").
From the characteristics described above and the method for assigning a functor role to an axg ~nent of a predicate  , we adopt the method that a funcmr role is added to a constituent by a kind of lexical rule before function application  . In general , several candidate constituents are made by ~ he feature structure pre-formation  . For example , at the stage of AnoB-AnoB , when B is a functor and has a meaning such as location  , time and so on , two solutions for B are offered as candidates : one as an argument of Ano  , which works as a predicate , and the other as an adjunct . 
4 Correspondence between AnoB and the Sentence 4 . 1 Paraphrase o f A no B as a Noun Phrase w i th a Relative Clause The expression A no B can be paraphrased into ApVB or A ' B  , adding an appropriate particle p and verb / adjective V  , or reforming A to a verbal form A ' if appropriate  . Both ApV and A ' are relative clauses . 
The paraphrased expression is more informative and some of the ambiguity is resolved  . Paraphrases of Ano Bin Case 1 -Case 4 are rather easy , as added verbs/adjectives do not depend so much on context as compared with Case  5  . Noun phrases with a relative clause for each case in the AnoB classification are shown in Table  2  . 
Such paraphrases are obtained by a change from a verb-centered to a noun-centered view  . A no B is generally related to some event or state in a discourse  , and the event or state is represented by an appropriate predicate : pred  ( A , B ) . By taking a noun-centered view , the representation is transferred into a representation A\[pred  ( A ( * )  , B )\] , that is , A in pred(A , B ) . 
The expression that gives the corresponding predicate is taken from the value of the pred attribute in the semantic structure  . A noun phrase paraphrased with a relative clause is generally constructed as follows:  1  ) the head B is put first , 2) a verb is chosen based on the rel attribute , and put to the left or B ,  3 ) a noun phrase corresponding to the appropriate case role as given by the argument structure of the predicate  , is constructed from A and the particle indicated by a default-marker  . 
and put to the left of the verb . For instance , in zoonoomosa (" weight of an elephant ") , first , the headomosa is taken ; second , verb rnotsu ( " nave " ) is taken from a value of rel , and put to the left of omosa ; third , the agent zooga ( " elephant " ) is put to the left of omos a . In this way , the desired complex noun phrase zoog amots u omosa  ( " weigh that a nelephant has " ) is arrived at . 
4 . 2 On Disambiguation by Contextual Information Although AnoB is semantically ambiguous  , it can generally be disambiguated by contextual information  . 
Although inferences including association and analogy are generally necessary  , this paper briefly mentions the possibility of the disambiguation method by unification no B classification \ [  Case1\]   . .* ApVB p : ga / o / de / ni ( case particles ) , V : suru ( " do " ) Iohonau ( " do " ) /okoru ( " happen " ) h are no hehon ( " his marriage " ) - ~ baregasurukehkon ( ' marriage that he performs " ) \[Case2\]-- , ApVBp:ga/o(case particles ) , V : aru ( " be ' ) /suru ( ' do " ) /shita ( ' done " ) / enoma ~ ( ' front of a house " ) --* ie gaaruma e ( " front of a place where a house is ' ) \[Case3\]-*AgamotsuB ( " B which has A " ) is hinoomosa ( ' weight of astone " ) --* is higamotsuomosa ( " weight which astone has ' ) \[ Case 4\]-* Aosuru B ( " B ' which do A " ) sanpono hito ( " person whost rolls " ) -~ sanpoosuruhito ( " person whost rolls " ) \[Case S\]~Ap VBp:n . iIgaIham/notameni ( particles ) , V : aru ( " bein " ) /motsu ( ' have ' ) /tsuhurareru ( " be made ' ) /ohosu ( " cause " ) ~oeno doozoo ( " statue in a park " ) -bhoo~nnia rudoozoo ( " statue which is in a park ' ) between a predicate structure in AnoB semantic structure and the related event structure in the discourse  . A sequence of related events is described in a discourse  . On the other hand , the semantic structure is represented by an appropriate predicate feature  . 
From these , the correct structure can be obtained by unifying an event semantic structure with a predicate feature in AnoB as follows  . 
event-semantic-structure-in-context-pred -structure-in-semantic-structure-of-AnoBHere  , " -" means that the lefthand side unifies with the right hand side  . 
Ambiguities of AnoBmay result from a mibiguities regarding the predicates that could be added  , ambiguities in the words themselves , or ambiguous case relations . The disambiguation process is illustrated below using an example in which the added predicates are ambiguous  . Generally , a verb-centered semantic structure is extracted from a sentence  . For the sentence , ( sl ) Hanako wakyone neok . aita . 
(' ~ Hanako painted a picture last year . ") the following semantic structure is obtained . This representation is simplified , showing only the information needed for the explanation  . 
pred:\[rehpaint agent : Hanako object : picture \] This semantic structure can be obtained also from the noun-centered semantic structure as follows  . 
picture\[pred:rehpaint agent : Hanako object : picture  ( * ) \] Next , let us assume that the sentence ( s2 ) occurs in the context of ( sl )  . 
(s2) Hanakono e waten rank aide yuu shooshita.
("The picture of Hanako/Hanako's picture won the first prize in an exhibition  . " ) Hanakonoe ( " the picture of Hanako " Hanako's picture " ) is ambiguous when taken out of context , with a range of possible semantic relations including possession  , purchase , producer , and content . 
However , the ambiguity is resolved by unifying the semantic structure of the previous sentence with each of the semantic structures representing the possible semantic relations : the only semantic structure which can be successfully unified has the producer relation  . 
5. Remarks
This research concerns semantic structures , especially those of noun phrases , and was conducted as part of a series of research efforts in the LUTE  ( Language Understander , Translator , & Editor ) project \[ e ,  7 . I0 , nl To date , ten thousand examples of A no B have been collected from scientific and newspaper articles  , and the appropriateness of the classification of A no B investigated  . In addition , as a preliminary experiment , a semantic relation analysis was tried with about a thousand examples  , with rather satisfactory results . The meaning of AnoB is generally ambiguous , and contextual information is needed to resolve the ambiguities  . There seems to be variety of such ambiguities relating to contextual information  , but in principle such ambiguities are considered to be resolved by assuming appropriate predicates as described in this paper  .
