~escope of the system trader discussion is to display structures based on the modeled grarmar  . Full language definition with facilitation of semantic interpretation is not within the scope of the systems described in this paper  . Application of gran rartesting to an applied linguistics research envi~tisenphasized  . Extensions to the teaching of linguistics principles and to refine mm t of the primitive All f % mc tions are also con-sidered  .

Virginia Technological University syntactic as well as s~ticlevel of analysis  . The ATN is proposed as a tool for assist in ~ the linguist to develop systsmatic descriptions of ~ edata  . It is assumed that the typical user will interface with the system at a point where an AEN and lexicon have bem~developed  . The ATN is developed from the theoretical model chosen by the linguist  . 
Once the ~ is implememt adasa cooputational procedure  , the user enters test data , displays structures , the lexicon , and edits the grammr to produce a refined A~\] grarmar description  . The displayed structures provide a labeled structural in remy retation of the input string based on the lin=~uistic model used  . Trac-ing ' of the parse may be used to follow the process of building the structural interpretation  . Computational implemm ~ tation requires giving attention to the details of the interrelationships of gr ~  . matical rules and the interaction between the grammar rule system and the lexical representation  . Testing the grammraga inst data forces a level of systemization that is significantly more rigorous than discussion oriented evaluation of gra~ersys ~ m  ,  . 
The model provides a meens of organizing strut -rural descriptions at any level  , from surface syntax to deep propositional in rerpreta = icms  .

The graphical representation of a gramrar permitted by the neua or k model is a relati ~ ly clear and precise way to express notions about struc-t ~/ re  . 

Computational simulation of the grams renables systematic tracing of subc~xx~nts and testing against text data  . 

Grimes (2) , in a series of linguistics workshops , d~strafed the utility of the network model ~ in envi-~u~ntswh ~ e computational testir ~ of grammrs was r~t possible  . Grimes , along with other c~ntributors to the referenced work  , illustrated the flexibility of the ATN in talc analysis of gr ~ ratical structures  . A ~ implerentations haven msCly focused on effective natural language understanding systems  , assuming a computationally sophisticated research envir ~ t  . Inplementatior mare ofte ~ in an enviror mm~t which requires some in depth~mderstanding and support of LISP systems  . Recently much of the infornmtion on the ATN formalism  , applications and techniques for impler ~ ntation was summarized by Bates  ( 3 )  . Tnc~h~amy systems have be ~ developed , little attention has been giv ~ to = eating an interactive grarmar modeling system for an individual with highly developed linguistics skills but poorly developed c ~ putational skills  . 
The individual involved in field Lir ~= % ~ istics is concerned with developing concise workable descriptions of some corpus of detain a ~ ven language  . Perti ~ , 7~ problems in developing rules for incerpreting surfaces ~- uctn ~ reproposed and discussed in relation to the da ~ a  . In field lir~tics applications , this in-wives developing arm x or ~ my of structural types follow-ed by hypothesizing on derlying rule systems which provide the highest level of data integration at a  2  . Desi = ~ ConsideratiorsThegm ~ raldasi ~ goal for the grammrrasing sys~described here is to provide a tool for developing experimentally drive ~  , systematic representation models of language data  . Engineering of a full Lmguage ~ erstamdimg system is not the ~ f~mm-y focus of the efforts described in this paper  . Ideally , one would Like Coprovide a tool which would attract applied linguists to use such as yst~n as a simulation environmen = for model developmen =  . 
design goals for the systems described are : i . Ease of use for both novice and expert modes of . operation , 2 . Perspicuity of gr~m ~ r representation , 3 . Support for a variety of linguistic theories , 4 . Trarm portability to a variety of systems . 
The p~to type grammr designs ys ~ consists of a gram ~ rgemerator  , a ~ editor , and a monitor . The f~mc-tion of U % egr ; ~ . ~ editor is to provide a means of defining and mm % iv ~ lating gr~mar descriptions w ~ thouc requiring the user to work in a specific programing langu ~ eenv ~ uL ~  , = L  ~ . ~e editor is also used to edic lexicons . The editor knows shout the b/N envirormen ~ and can provide assistsmce to the user as needed  . 
The monitor's function is coh and le input and out -puc of gr ~-~ and lexicon files  , manage displays and traces of parsir ~ s , provide o ~ sultation on the sysran use as needed , and enable the user to cycle from editor to parsing with mi ~ m  , ~ effort . The monitor can also be used to provide facilities for studying gram~reffi-ciemcy  . Transportability of the gr~mn ~" modeling sysm is established by a progran generator whi ~  , henable sim-pl ~ tation in differ anc progr ~ m~ng ~ es  . 
3 . Two In Dlemmutatiors of Grit Tes ~ Sysr~-s To deu ~ lop some understanding on the designam d imple remrmtion requirements for as ysr~n as specified in the previous section  , D ~ o experimenr . algr ~'-~" resting systems have been developed . A partial A ~ im-pl~m~nta=ion was dune by ~_hler ( A ) in a system ( SNOPAR ) ~dnich provided some interactive gr . ~ Tr ~ T and development facilities . SNOPAR imcorporated several of the basic features of a grammr generator and monitor  , with a limited editor , agra-m=~gererator and a number of other fea =uras  . 
Both SNOPAR and ADEPT are implemenred in SNO~OL and both have been ~: rarmpcrr ~ edacross opera  . rigsysrems ( i . e . TOPS-20 coI~M's~;) . For implemm ~ retion of rex = edi Cir ~ and program grin  , margemerar . ion , the S~OBOL & language is reasonable . However , the Lackofccmprehen-sive list storage marm @snentisal~n ~ tatio ~ on the extension of ~ impleren re = ion ~ oa full natural language ~ mdersr~sysr~n  . Originally , S~DBOL was used because a suirmble ~ was no C available to the i~plem ~ r  . 
3.1 SNOPAR

One of the goals in = he design of ~ . ~3PAR was to in ~' c ~ , ~ceanotation which was easier to read than the LISP reprase mta=ion most frequently used  . 
Two basic formats have been used for wri~nggrab -mars in ~ qOPA  . ~ . One separates dm conrex ~ c-free syntax type operations f-contherests and actions of the grammar  . This action block fo = ma ~ is of the following gem - era \]  . for=:arc-type-block stare arc-type arc - type:S  ( ' i'D ( test-action-block ) ) : S CID ( = est-action-block )   ) : F  ~ ) where arc-type is a CAT , P ~ RSE or FIN ~ . ~ RDe~c . , and the test-action-block appears as folluws : = es C-action-blocks r ~ rearc-reSt:Iaction : S  ( TO ( arc-type-bl6d < ) ) arc-rest ! action : S ( TO ( arc-rype-block ) ) where an arc-test is a CC~PAR or other tes t and an action is a ~ or HUILDS type action  . Note that m ' ~ additional intermedia restare is in = roduaed for the test and ac=iuns of the AXN  .

The Parse function calls subneu ~ rks which consist of Parse  , C , a corother arc-types . Structures are initially built through use of the SETR function which uses the top level consti  , ;:um" , c~(e . g .

Once uhe ~ = ~ rk is defined , arcs ~ ay byedired by specifying = he origin and dest/na=ion of the arc  . ~ earcinfor~mcion is presemr ~ din = he following order : arc destination  , arc type , arc test and arc actions . Each of values on the arc list by ~ yping in the needed in for = m-tion  . t ~ i tiple arcs between states are differentiated by specifying the order nu ~ er of the arc or by displaying all arcs to the user and requesting selection of the desired arc  . 
N ~ arcs are inserted in the network by U~eI m and  . -vhenever an arc insert is performed all arcs from the state are nurbered and displayed  . After the user specifies the nu~er of the arc that then ~ arc is to follow  , the arc information is entered . 
Arcs nay be reordered by specifying the starting state for the arcs of in Cerast using the  0 command . ~ euser is then requested ~ ospecify the r ~ ordering of ~ Searcs  . 
Insertion and deletion of a state requires that the editor determine the sta~as which r  . ' mybereached the new state as well as finding which arcs terminate on the  n~4 state . Once this information has been establish-ed , the arc information may be entered . 
~ nena state is deleted , all arcs which inmediately leave the state or which enter the state fr~nother stares are removed  . Error ? onditioos exist ~ in the network as a result of the deletion are then reported  . 
The user then ei ~ er verifies the requested deletion and corrects any errors or cancels the request  . 
Grarmar files are stored in a list format . ~ he PUT cou-n , ar . dcauses all networ P . scurrently defined to be written out to a file . GET will read in and define a grammar . 
If the net ~ . .~ork is already defined , the network is r ~: ~: read in . 
By placing a series of checking functions in an A ~N editor  , it is possible to fil~er out many potential errors before a grammrisrested  . ~ he user is able to focus on the grammr model and not on the specific pro-gra~ming requir ~ r ~ nts  . A monitor progra ~ provides a toplevel interface to the user once a grammar is defined for parsing sentances  . In addition , the monitor program manages the stacks as well as the S~qD  , LIFT and HOLD lists for the network gr~m~s r .   9wi~ches may be set to control the tracing of the parse . 
An additional feature of the ~ . bods ADF . Yr syst~n is the use of easy to read displays for the lexicon and gra'iIr ~  . An exar ~ lear C is shown: ( ~ ) -- CAT ( ' DET ' ) --  ( A_nJ ) ? ~ qOTESI'S .  ~
