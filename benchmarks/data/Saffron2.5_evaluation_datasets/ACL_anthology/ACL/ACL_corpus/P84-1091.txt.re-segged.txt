The algorithm takes as only input all st of words , preferably but not necessarily in phonemic transcription  , in any two putatively related languages , and sorts it into decreasing order of probable cognatlon  . The processing of a 250-1tem bilingual list takes about five seconds of CPU time on a DEC  KLI091  , and requires 56 pages of core memory . The algorithm is given no information whatsoever about the phonemic transcription  . used , and even though cognate identification is carried out on the basis of a contextfree one-for -one matching of indivl dual characters  , its cognation decisions are bettered by a trained linguist using more information only in cases of word llsts sharing less than  40% cognates and involving complex , mu \] tlple sound correspondences . 
IF UNDAMENT ALPROCE DURES
A . Identifying Sound Correspondences
Consider the following word llst from two hypothetical Austronesian-llke ivnguages : 
Titla Sese " eye " mats nas " sea " tasisah " father " tamssan " mother " mamanan " tongue " mimlnen " shellfish " slslhe he " bad " satl has " to stand " tlse " to come " mena " with " ml ne " not " saha Take the first word pair  , mata/nas . We base no information about the phonetic values of their constituent characters  , we do not know whether the same system of transcription was used in both word llsts : for all we know " a " might denotes a high back rounded vowel in Tit ~ a and auvular trill in Sese  . The only assumption allowed is that in each word llst the same characters represent  , more or less , the same sounds . Under this assumption , the possibility that any one character of a member of a word pair may correspond to any character of the other member cannot be discarded  . Thus in the pair mata/n as Titia " m " may correspond to Sese " n "  , " a " , or " s " , and so may Titia " a " , " t " , " s " , and " s " . 
We summarize the evidence for these possible correspondences in an TxS matrix  , where T is the number of different characters found in the Titla word llst  , S that in the Sese word llst . 
Thus the evidence afforded by the first pair , mats/has:

Matrix A ( observed frequencies )
If character correspondences between t be Titla and Seseword pairs were random the expected frequency e\[i  , J\]of recorded possible correspon-alphabet and the jth of the Sese alphabet would be : e\[i  , J\]-sum of ith row x sum of Jth column sum of cells giving a matrix of expected frequencies of possible sound correspondences :

Sums of columns 2412 1828 18100
Matrix B ( expected frequencies )
Note how the six character correspondences wlth the greatest differences between observed and expected frequencies give the simple substitution code used for generating Seatwords from pseudo- 
Austroneslan Titla:
Titta Sese Observed-Expected mn 5 . 84 sh 4 . 48 ie 3 . 36 aa 3 . 28 ts 2 . 48
B . Identifying Null Correspondences
Call the difference between the observed and the expected frequency of a character correspondence its weight  ( smuch less primitive definition of weight is used In the actual implementation  )  . 
Take the first word palr ( mats/has ) and enter into a 4x3 matrix W the wel~hts of its 12 possible character correspondences : nasm 5  . 84 -0 . 28 -1 . 96 a 1 . 16 3 . 28 0 . 96 t-1 . 92 0 . 64 2 . 48 a 1 . 16 3 . 28 0 . 96
Matrix W ( weights )
Call potential of a character correspondence the sum of its weight and of the highest potential of all possible character correspondences to its right  , i . e . 
Pot(i,J ) = W\[I,J\]+max(Pot(i + l . .m,J+l . .n ) ) giving the matrix of potentials P for word pair mata/nafl:naam  11  . 60 2 . 28 -1 . 96 a 4 . 44 5 . 76 0 . 96 t1 . 36 1 . 60 2 . 48 a 1 . 16 3 . 28 0 . 96
Matrix P ( petentlals )
The character correspondence with the blg hest potential is herem/n  ( P\[I , I\]-II . 6) . Of its possible successors , that with the highest potent lalisa/a(P\[2 , 2\]ffiS . 76), itself followed by t/s(P\[3,3\]-2 . 48), which has no passible successor . 
Thus we have:
Titia Sese Potential mn 11 . 60 aa 5 . 76 ts 2 . 4 8 a zero The same procedure applied to the rest of the word llst gives the proper matches  , Tlt laflnals in polysyllabic words having been deleted when deriving the corresponding Sese words  . 
C . A Relative Measure of Cognatlon
Call index of cognatl on the maximum potent lalof a word palr divided by its number of cor respondences  , including null correspondences . 
Thus in the fictitious case of Tttia and Seset be index of cognatton of the pairmats /hasis  2   . 9 ( its maximum potential , 11 . 60 , divided by the number of correspondences ,  4 )  . Word pairs with high cognation indices are foun ~ to be more often genetically related than pairs with low cognatlon indices  .

A . Weights.
The difference between observed and expected frequencies does not provide a satisfactory measurement of the weight of a posslble character correspondence  . Several alternative measurements were tested , out of whl cb standardized scores were retained : the weight of a character correspondence was redefined as the and expected frequencies of occurrence not be Jng due to chance  , expressed as a zscore . Where absolute frequencies of 20 and less are involved the exact probabillty is calculated and translated into a z score using a polynomial approximation  ( Abramowitz and Stegun 1970 )  . 
B . Vowel/Consonant Correspondences
Disallowing correspondences between vowels and consonants vastly improved the performance of the algorlt bm  . No human intervention is needed to identify vowels from consonants  , an improved version of an algorithm described in Suhotln  1962 being used to identify characters which represent vowel sounds  . Whether consonants should be allowed to correspond to vowels is left as an option in the current implementation  . 
C . Iterations
Performance is again improved when word pairs showing individual character matches as computed from matrices of potent lals  ( section IB above ) are reprocessed . The weights of possible character correspondences are recomputed  . This time , however , only characters in the same positions in the two words are scored as possible correspondences  . Thus for instance , the first pass of the algorithm having matched the " m " of " mata " to the " n " of " n as "  , Titla " m " is scored in the second pass as corresponding possibly only to Sese " n "  . Sequences of alternate null correspondences are collapsed so as not to preclude the identification of correspondences which might have been missed in the first pass  , e . g . a pairmat/motmatched in the first pass a smm zero o a zerott is reln put in the second pass a smmaottWeights of possible character correspondences having thus been recomputed  , a new matrix of potentials and a new cognatlon index is computed for each word pair  . Further iterations were found to yield negligible improvements to the results obtained  . 
D . Improved Weights and Cognation Indices Frequent character correspondences often yield very high z scores  ( up to 1@ . 2) . The presence of even one such hl~hscore in a word pair often invalidates the character -matchlng procedure  . A number of alternative alterations to the definition of weight were tried  , out of which the simplest proved best : weights beyond an arbitrary value are set to that value  . Practice showed a maximum value of 3 . 0 to 4 . 0 to give the best results . This is not surprlsing , since there is Do significant difference in the degrees of certainty corresponding to z scores of  4 and beyond . 
The last improvement in the performance of the algorithm to date was brought by a redefinition of the cognatlon index  . Once the individual character matches of a word pair have been identified from its matrix of potentials their weights are adjusted as follows : I  ) Positive weights less tban 1 . 28  ( corresponding to a 90% significance level ) are set to zero ; negative weights and weights greater than 1 . 28 are left unchanged . 
2 ) Positive weights of character-to-zero matches are set to zero  ; negative weights are left unchanged . 
The cognatlon index is then defined as the sum of the adjusted weights divided by the number of matches  , e . g .   ( an actual example from two languages of Vanuatu ) :

Origlnal Adjusted x zero -0 . 64 aa 3 . 98 hD1 . 06 azero 2 . 12 tD 3 . 12 iI 2 . 86 azero 2 . 12
Cognatlon index : 9 . 32/8 -0 . 64 3 . 98 0 . 00 0 . 00 3 . 12 2 . 86 0 . 00 9 . 32 = 1 . 165
IIIPER FOR MANCE OF THE ALGORITHM
The algorithm as described has been implemented in Simula  67 on a DEC ELI091 and applied to a corpus of some 300 words in 75 languages and dialects of Vanuatu . Results are excellent for languages sharing 40% or more cognates , even when sound correspondences are complex . They deterioraterapldly when lesser proportions of cognates and complex sound correspondences are involved  , but remain excellent when mainly one-to-one correspondences are present  . 
Thus for instance Sakao and Tolomako ( Espirltu Santo , Vanuatu ) were given as sharing 38 . 91 ~ cognates ( cutoff cognation index : 1 . 28) , as against a human estimate of 41% backed by a full knowledge of their dlachronlc phonologles and comparisons with other related languages  . Out of the 50 word pairs with the highest cognation indices only two  ( the 38th and the 45th ) were defl nltely not cognate and one ( the 36th ) doubtful . 
Yet , Sakao has undergone extremely complex phonological changes  , viz . :
Tolomako Sakao " eye " nata m6a " throat " tsalor lo " banana " ~ et alii ~ l " to blow " su ~ ihy " nine " I in a ratatil ~ ner ~ p ?~ 
The identification of environment-conditioned phonologlcal correspondences is the next  , most obvious stage in further improving the algorithm  . This problem has of course been , and is being , investigated . Difficulties arise from the fact that frequencies of possible correspondences in any given environment become too low to be handled by statl stlcal tests  . Other approaches -- inspired from chess-playlng programs -- have been tried  , but have proved too expensive in computer tlmeso far  . A further , much desirable , improvement is the ~ dentlfication of rules of metatbes is  . The solution to this problem appears to be subordinated to that of the dlscovery of context -sensitive rules  . 
VPUR POSE OF THE ALGORITHM
A bill ngua \] word llst is conceptually equivalent to a bilingual text : words of all st to sentences of a text  , phonemes of sword to morphemes of a sentence , cognate pairs to segments of the same meaning , non-cognates to segments of different meanings , and the algorithm describe dist be present state of an attempted solution to the much more general fol\]owlng problem : given two texts of approximately equal lengths in two different languages  , determine whether one is the translation of t be other--or both translations of a text in a third language--wholly or In parts  , and Ifso , establish the rules for translating one into the other  .
