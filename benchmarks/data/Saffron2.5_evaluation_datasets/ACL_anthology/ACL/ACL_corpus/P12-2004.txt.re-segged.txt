Abstract
We present LLCCM , a loglinear variant of the constituent context model ( CCM ) of grammar induction . LLCCM retains the simplicity of the original CCM but extends robustly to long sentences . On sentences of up to length 40,
LLCCM outperforms CCM by 13.9% bracketing F1 and outperforms a right-branching baseline in regimes where CCM does not.
1 Introduction
Unsupervised grammar induction is a fundamental challenge of statistical natural language processing ( Lari and Young , 1990; Pereira and Schabes , 1992; Carroll and Charniak , 1992). The constituent context model ( CCM ) for inducing constituency parses ( Klein and Manning , 2002) was the first unsupervised approach to surpass a right-branching baseline . However , the CCM only effectively models short sentences . This paper shows that a simple reparameterization of the model , which ties together the probabilities of related events , allows the CCM to extend robustly to long sentences.
Much recent research has explored dependency grammar induction . For instance , the dependency model with valence ( DMV ) of Klein and Manning (2004) has been extended to utilize multilingual information ( Berg-Kirkpatrick and Klein , 2010; Cohen et al , 2011), lexical information ( Headden III et al ., 2009), and linguistic universals ( Naseem et al , 2010). Nevertheless , simplistic dependency models like the DMV do not contain information present in a constituency parse , such as the attachment order of object and subject to a verb.
Unsupervised constituency parsing is also an active research area . Several studies ( Seginer , 2007; Reichart and Rappoport , 2010; Ponvert et al , 2011) have considered the problem of inducing parses over raw lexical items rather than part-of-speech ( POS ) tags . Additional advances have come from more complex models , such as combining CCM and DMV ( Klein and Manning , 2004) and modeling large tree fragments ( Bod , 2006).
The CCM scores each parse as a product of probabilities of span and context subsequences . It was originally evaluated only on unpunctuated sentences up to length 10 ( Klein and Manning , 2002), which account for only 15% of the WSJ corpus ; our experiments confirm the observation in ( Klein , 2005) that performance degrades dramatically on longer sentences . This problem is unsurprising : CCM scores each constituent type by a single , isolated multinomial parameter.
Our work leverages the idea that sharing information between local probabilities in a structured unsupervised model can lead to substantial accuracy gains , previously demonstrated for dependency grammar induction ( Cohen and Smith , 2009; Berg-Kirkpatrick et al , 2010). Our model , LogLinear CCM ( LLCCM ), shares information between the probabilities of related constituents by expressing them as a loglinear combination of features trained using the gradient-based learning procedure of Berg-Kirkpatrick et al (2010). In this way , the probability of generating a constituent is informed by related constituents.
Our model improves unsupervised constituency parsing of sentences longer than 10 words . On sentences of up to length 40 (96% of all sentences in the Penn Treebank ), LLCCM outperforms CCM by 13.9% ( unlabeled ) bracketing F1 and , unlike CCM , outperforms a right-branching baseline on sentences longer than 15 words.
17 2 Model
The CCM is a generative model for the unsupervised induction of binary constituency parses over sequences of part-of-speech ( POS ) tags ( Klein and Manning , 2002). Conditioned on the constituency or distituency of each span in the parse , CCM generates both the complete sequence of terminals it contains and the terminals in the surrounding context.
Formally , the CCM is a probabilistic model that jointly generates a sentence , s , and a bracketing , B , specifying whether each contiguous subsequence is a constituent or not , in which case the span is called a distituent . Each subsequence of POS tags , or SPAN , ?, occurs in a CONTEXT , ?, which is an ordered pair of preceding and following tags . A bracketing is a boolean matrix B , indicating which spans ( i , j ) are constituents ( Bij = true ) and which are distituents ( Bij = false ). A bracketing is considered legal if its constituents are nested and form a binary tree T ( B).
The joint distribution is given by:
P(s,B ) = PT ( B ) ? ? i,j?T ( B)
PS (?( i , j , s)|true ) PC (?( i , j , s)|true ) ? ? i,j 6?T ( B ) PS (?( i , j , s)|false ) PC (?( i , j , s)|false ) The prior over unobserved bracketings PT ( B ) is fixed to be the uniform distribution over all legal bracketings . The other distributions , PS (?) and PC (?), are multinomials whose isolated parameters are estimated to maximize the likelihood of a set of observed sentences { sn } using EM ( Dempster et al , 1977).1 2.1 The LogLinear CCM A fundamental limitation of the CCM is that it contains a single isolated parameter for every span . The number of different possible span types increases exponentially in span length , leading to data sparsity as the sentence length increases.
1As mentioned in ( Klein and Manning , 2002), the CCM model is deficient because it assigns probability mass to yields and spans that cannot consistently combine to form a valid sentence . Our model does not address this issue , and hence it is similarly deficient.
The LogLinear CCM ( LLCCM ) reparameterizes the distributions in the CCM using intuitive features to address the limitations of CCM while retaining its predictive power . The set of proposed features includes a BASIC feature for each parameter of the original CCM , enabling the LLCCM to retain the full expressive power of the CCM . In addition , LLCCM contains a set of coarse features that activate across distinct spans.
To introduce features into the CCM , we express each of its local conditional distributions as a multiclass logistic regression model . Each local distribution , Pt(y|x ) for t ? { SPAN,CONTEXT }, conditions on label x ? { true , false } and generates an event ( span or context ) y . We can define each local distribution in terms of a weight vector , w , and feature vector , fxyt , using a loglinear model:
Pt(y|x ) = exp ? w , fxyt ? ? y ? exp ? w , fxy?t ? (1) This technique for parameter transformation was shown to be effective in unsupervised models for part-of-speech induction , dependency grammar induction , word alignment , and word segmentation ( Berg-Kirkpatrick et al , 2010). In our case , replacing multinomials via featurized models not only improves model accuracy , but also lets the model apply effectively to a new regime of long sentences.
2.2 Feature Templates
In the SPAN model , for each span y = [?1, . . . , ? n ] and label x , we use the following feature templates:
BASIC : I [ y = ? ? x = ?]
BOUNDARY : I [?1 = ? ? ? n = ? ? x = ?]
PREFIX : I [?1 = ? ? x = ?]
SUFFIX : I [? n = ? ? x = ?]
Just as the external CONTEXT is a signal of constituency , so too is the internal ? context .? For example , there are many distinct noun phrases with different spans that all begin with DT and end with NN ; a fact expressed by the BOUNDARY feature ( Table 1).
In the CONTEXT model , for each context y = [?1, ?2] and constituent/distituent decision x , we use the following feature templates:
BASIC : I [ y = ? ? x = ?]
L-CONTEXT : I [?1 = ? ? x = ?]
R-CONTEXT : I [?2 = ? ? x = ?] the WSJ : 0 The 1

Both spans (0, 3) and (4, 6) are constituents corresponding to noun phrases whose features are shown in Table 1:
Feature Name (0,3) (4, 6) sp an

BASIC-DT-NN : 0 1

R-CONTEXT-VBD : 1 0
R-CONTEXT -: 0 1
Table 1: Span and context features for constituent spans (0, 3) and (4, 6). The symbol  indicates a sentence boundary.
Notice that although the BASIC span features are active for at most one span , the remaining features fire for both spans , effectively sharing information between the local probabilities of these events.
The coarser CONTEXT features factor the context pair into its components , which allow the LLCCM to more easily learn , for example , that a constituent is unlikely to immediately follow a determiner.
3 Training
In the EM algorithm for estimating CCM parameters , the E-Step computes posteriors over bracketings using the Inside-Outside algorithm . The M-Step chooses parameters that maximize the expected complete log likelihood of the data.
The weights , w , of LLCCM are estimated to maximize the data log likelihood of the training sentences { sn }, summing out all possible bracketings
B for each sentence:
L(w ) = ? sn log ?
B
Pw(sn , B)
We optimize this objective via LBFGS ( Liu and Nocedal , 1989), which requires us to compute the objective gradient . Berg-Kirkpatrick et al (2010) showed that the data log likelihood gradient is equivalent to the gradient of the expected complete log likelihood ( the objective maximized in the M-step of EM ) at the point from which expectations are computed . This gradient can be computed in three steps.
First , we compute the local probabilities of the CCM , Pt(y|x ), from the current w using Equation (1). We approximate the normalization over an exponential number of terms by only summing over spans that appeared in the training corpus.
Second , we compute posteriors over bracketings , P(i , j|sn ), just as in the E-step of CCM training,2 in order to determine the expected counts : exy,SPAN = ? sn ? ij
I [?( i , j , sn ) = y ] ?( x ) exy,CONTEXT = ? sn ? ij
I [?( i , j , sn ) = y ] ?( x ) where ?( true ) = P(i , j|sn ), and ?( false ) = 1 ? ?( true).
We summarize these expected count quantities as : exyt = { exy,SPAN if t = SPAN exy,CONTEXT if t = CONTEXT Finally , we compute the gradient with respect to w , expressed in terms of these expected counts and conditional probabilities : ? L(w ) = ? xyt exytfxyt ? G(w)
G(w ) = ? xt ( ? y exyt ) ? y?
Pt(y|x)fxy?t
Following ( Klein and Manning , 2002), we initialize the model weights by optimizing against posterior probabilities fixed to the split-uniform distribution , which generates binary trees by randomly choosing a split point and recursing on each side of the split.3 2We follow the dynamic program presented in Appendix A.1 of ( Klein , 2005).
3In Appendix B.2, Klein (2005) shows this posterior can be expressed in closed form . As in previous work , we start the initialization optimization with the zero vector , and terminate after 10 iterations to regularize against achieving a local maximum.
19 3.1 Efficiently Computing the Gradient The following quantity appears in G(w ): ? t(x ) = ? y exyt Which expands as follows depending on t : ? SPAN(x ) = ? y ? sn ? ij
I [?( i , j , sn ) = y ] ?( x ) ? CONTEXT(x ) = ? y ? sn ? ij
I [?( i , j , sn ) = y ] ?( x)
In each of these expressions , the ?( x ) term can be factored outside the sum over y . Each fixed ( i , j ) and sn pair has exactly one span and context , hence the quantities ? y I [?( i , j , sn ) = y ] and ? y I [?( i , j , sn ) = y ] are both equal to 1.
?t(x ) = ? sn ? ij ?( x)
This expression further simplifies to a constant.
The sum of the posterior probabilities , ?( true ), over all positions is equal to the total number of constituents in the tree . Any binary tree over N terminals contains exactly 2N ? 1 constituents and ? t(x ) = {? sn (2|sn | ? 1) if x = true ? sn(|sn | ? 2)(|sn | ? 1) if x = false where | sn | denotes the length of sentence sn.
Thus , G(w ) can be precomputed once for the entire dataset at each minimization step . Moreover , ? t(x ) can be precomputed once before all iterations.
3.2 Relationship to Smoothing
The original CCM uses additive smoothing in its M-step to capture the fact that distituents outnumber constituents . For each span or context , CCM adds 10 counts : 2 as a constituent and 8 as a distituent.4 We note that these smoothing parameters are tailored to short sentences : in a binary tree , the number of constituents grows linearly with sentence length , whereas the number of distituents grows quadratically . Therefore , the ratio of constituents to distituents is not constant across sentence lengths . In contrast , by virtue of the loglinear model , LLCCM assigns positive probability to all spans or contexts without explicit smoothing.
4These counts are specified in ( Klein , 2005); Klein and Manning (2002) added 10 constituent and 50 distituent counts.

4 Experiments
We train our models on gold POS sequences from all sections (024) of the WSJ ( Marcus et al , 1993) with punctuation removed . We report bracketing F1 scores between the binary trees predicted by the models on these sequences and the treebank parses.
We train and evaluate both a CCM implementation ( Luque , 2011) and our LLCCM on sentences up to a fixed length n , for n ? {10, 15, . . . , 40}. Figure 1 shows that LLCCM substantially outperforms the CCM on longer sentences . After length 15, CCM accuracy falls below the right branching baseline , whereas LLCCM remains significantly better than right-branching through length 40.
5 Conclusion
Our loglinear variant of the CCM extends robustly to long sentences , enabling constituent grammar induction to be used in settings that typically include long sentences , such as machine translation reordering ( Chiang , 2005; DeNero and Uszkoreit , 2011;
Dyer et al , 2011).
