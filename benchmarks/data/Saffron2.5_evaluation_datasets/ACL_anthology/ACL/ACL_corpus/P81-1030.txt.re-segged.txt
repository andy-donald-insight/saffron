ABSTRACT : The definition texts of a machine -readable pocket dictionary were analyzed to determine the disambiguated word sense of the kernel terms of each word sense being def in ed  . The resultant sets of word pairs of defined and defining words were then computa Cionally connected in to t~o taxonomic semi-lattices  ( " tangled hierarchies " ) representing some 24 , 000 noun nodes and 11 , 000 verb nodes . The study of the nature of the " topmost " nodes in these hierarchies  . 
and the structure of the trees reveal info rmation about the nature of the dictionary's organization of the language  , the concept of semantic primitives and other aspects of lexical semantics  . The data proves that the dictionary offers a fundamentally consistent description of word meaning and may provide the basis for fu ture research and applications in computat ional linguistic systems  . 
1. INTRODUCTION
In the late 1960"s,John01ney et al . at System Development Corporation produced machine-readable copies of the Merriam-Webster New Pocke ~ Dictionary and the Sevent ~ Col legiate Dictionary  . These massive data files have been widely d istributed within the computation all inguistic community  , yet research upon the basic structure of the dictionary has been exceedingly slow and di fficult due to the Significant computer esources required to process tens of thousands of definitions  . 
The dictionary is a fascinating comput at ional resource  . 
It contains spelling , pronunciation , hyphenation , capitalization , usage notes for semantic domains , geographic regions , and propriety ; etymological , syntactic and semantic information about the most basic units of the language  . Accompanying definitions are example sentences which often use words in prototyp ical contexts  . Thus the dictionary should be able to serve as a resource for a variety of computation all inguistic needs  . My primary concern within the dictionary has been the development of dictionary data for use in understanding systems  . Thus I am concerned with what dictionary def initions tell us about the semantic and pragmatic structure of meaning  . The hypothesis I am proposing is that defini tions in the lexicon can be studied in the same manner as other large collections of ob jects such as plants  , animals , and minerals are studied . Thus I am concerned with enunerating the class if i cat  ions1 organization of the lexicon as it has been implicitly used by the dictionary's lexicographers  . 
Each textual definition in the dictionary is syntactically a noun or verb phrase with one or more kernel terms  . If one identifies these kernel terms of defini tions  , and then proceeds to disambiguate them relat ive to the senses offered in the same dict ionary under their respective definit ions  , then one can arrive at a large collection of pairs of disambiguated words which can be assembled into a taxonomic semi-lattice  . 
This task has been accomplished for all the de finition texts of nouns and verbs in a comu~n pocket dictionary  . 
This paper is an effort to reveal the resul ts of a preliminary examination of the st ructure of these databases  . 
The applications of this data are still in the future  . 
What might these applications be ?
First , the data shoul'd provide information on the contents of semantic domains  . One should be able to determine from a lexical taxonomy what domains one might be in given one has encountered the word " periscope "  , or " petiole " , or " petroleum " . 
Second , dictionary data should be of use in resolv ing semantic ambiguity in text  . Words in definitions appear in the company of their prototypical associates  . 
Third , dictionary data can provide the basis for c reating case gr-  , -~- r descriptions of verbs , and noun argument descriptions of nouns . Semantic templates of meaning are far richer when one considers the taxonomic inheritance of elements of the lexicon  . 
Fourth . the dictionary should offer a class if i cation which anthropological linguists and psycholinguists can use as an object ive reference in comparison with other cultu resor human memory observations  . This isn't to say that the dictionary'sc lassification is the same as the cultu re's or the human mind's  , only that it is an objective datum from which comparisons can be made  . 
Fifth . knowledge of how the dictionary is struc tured can be used by lexicographers to build better dictionaries  . 
And finally , the dictionary if converted into a computer tool can become more readily accessible to a ll the disciplines seeking Couse the cur rent paper-based versions  . Education . historical linguistics , sociology . English composition , etc . can all make steps foxward given that they can assume access to a dictionary is immediately available via computer  . I do not know what all these applications will be and the task at hand is simply an e lucidation of the dictionary's struc ture as it currently exists  . 
2 . " TANGLED " HIERARCHIES OF NOV NS AND VERBS The grant  . MCS77-01315 ,  '~ ) evelopment of a Computational Methodology for Der iving Natural Language Semantic Structures v ia Analysis of Machine-Readable Dictionar i es "  . created a taxonomy for the nouns and verbs of the Merriam-Webster Pocket Dictionary  ( MPD )  , based upon the hand-disambiguated kernel words in their definitions  . This taxonomy confirmed the anticipated st ructure of the lexicon to be that of a " tang led hierarchy "  \[8  , 9\] of unprecedented size (24 , 000 noun senses .  11 . 000 verb senses ) . This database is believed to be the first Cobe assembled which is representative of the structure of the entire English lex icon  .   ( A somewhat similar study of the Italian lex icon has been done  \[2  . 11\] )  . The content categories agree substantially w it h the semantic structure of the lexicon proposed by Nida \ [  I5  \ ]  , and the verb taxonomy confirms the primitives proposed by the San Diego LNR group  \[16\]   . 
This " tangled hierarchy " may be described as a formal data structure whose bottom is a set of terminal disambiguated words that are not used as kernel defining terms  ; these are the most specific elexents in the structure  . The tops of the structure are senses of words such as " cause "  , " thing " , '* class " , " being " , etc . 
These are the most general elements in the tangled hierarchy  . If all the top terms are considered to be forest becomes a tangled tree  . 
The terminal nodes of such trees are in general each connected to the Cop in a lattice  . An individual lattice can be resolved into a seCof " traces "  , each of which describes an alternate paCh from terminal to cop  . 
In acrate , each element implies the terms above iC , and further specifies the sense of the elements below it  . 
The collection of lattices forms a transitive acyclic digraph  ( or perhaps more clearly , a " semilattice " , that is , a lattice with a greatest upper bound , < word sense > , but no least lower bound ) . If we specify all the traces composing such a structure  , spanning all paths from top to bottom , we have topologically specified the semilattice  . Thus the list on the left in Figure I topologically specifies the tangled hierarchy on its right  .

Figure I . The Trace of a Tangled Hierarchy 2 . 1 TOPMOST SEMANTIC NODES OF THE TANGLED HIERARCHIES Turning from the abst rac t descr ip t ion of the fo res t of tang led h ie rarch ies Co the actua l data  , the first question which was answered was , ' What are the largest tangled hierarchies in the dictionary ?"  . The size of a tangled hierarchy is based upon two numbers  , the maximum depth below the " root " and the to tal number of nodes transitively reach ab le from the root  . Thus the tangled hierarchy of Figure 1 has a depth of 5 and conCains a total of 11 nodes ( including the " root " node , " a ") . 
However , since each nonterminal in Chetangled hierarchy was also enumerated  , it is also possible Codescribe the " si zes " of che other nodes reachable from " a "  . Their number of elemenCs and depChs given in Table  1  .

For example , " g " has the most single-level descendants ,  3 , yet it is neither at the Cop of the Cangled hierarchy  , nor does iC have the highest total number of descendants ? The root node " a " is at the top of the hierarchy  , yet it only has I single-level descendant . For nodes ? ohe considered of major importance in a tangled hierarchy it is chusnecessary to consider not only Cheir total number of descendants  , buc whether Chese descendants are all accual ly immediately under some ocher node Co which th is higher node is attached  . As we shall see , chenodes which have the most single-level descendants are actually more pivoral concepts in some cases  . 
Turning to the actual forest of Cangledhie rarchies  , Table 2 gives the frequencies of the size and depth of the largest noun hierarchies and Table  3 gives the sizes alone for verb hierarch i es  ( depths were no coompuced for these , unfortunately ) .

The list appears in terms of descending f requency  . The topmost nodes don't have many descendants a to ne level below  , but they each have one BIG descendant , the next node in the chain . CAUSE-2 . 0A has approximately 240 direct descendants , and MAKE-I . IA has 480 direct descendants making the set ~ o the topmost nodes in terms of number of direct descendants  , though they are ranked 9th and 13th in terms of total descendants ( under words such as EDL % IN- . 4A , CONTINUE- . 1A , etc .  )  . This points out in practice what the abst ract tree of Figure I showed as possible in theory  , and explains the seeming contradiction in having a basic verb such as "  CAUSE-2  . 0A " de f ined in te rms o f a lesser verb such as '~ EMAIN -  . 4a " . 
The difficulty is explainable given two facts  . First . 
the lexicographers HAD to define CAUSE-2 . 0 A using some other verb , etc . This is inherent in the lexicon being used to define itself  . Second , once one reaches the Cop of a tengled hierarchy one cannot go any higher -- and consequently forcing further definitions for basic verbs such as " be " and " cause " invariably leads CO using more specific verbs  , rather than more general ones . The situation is neither erroneous , nor inconsistent in the context of a self- defined closed system and will be di scussed further in the section on noun primit ives  . 
2.2 NOUNPRIMITIVES
One phenomenon which was anticipated in computationally grown trees was the exis tence of loops  . Loops are caused by having sequences of inter related definitions whose kernels form a ring-like array \  [5   . 20 \ ]  . However . 
what was not anticipated was how important such clusters of nodes would be both cothe under lying basis for the Caxonomies and as primit ives of the language  . Such circularity is sometimes evidence of a truly primitive concept  , such as the set containing the words CLASS , GROUP , TYPE , KIND , SET . DIVISION , CATEGORY . SPECIES , INDIVIDUAL , GROUPING , PART and SECTION . To understand this , consider the subset of interrelated senses these words share  ( Figure 3 ) and then the graphic representation of these in Figure  4   . 
GROUP1 . 0A - a number of ind iv idua ls re la ted by a common factor  ( as physical association , community of interests , or blood ) CLASS 1 , 1A - a KrouD of the same genera l s ta tus or nature TYPE  1  . 4A-ac~ass , k ~ nd , or 2 rouoset apart by com ~ on characteristics KIND Io2A - a 2rouv united by common traits or interests

Figure 4. " GROUP " Concept Primitive from
Dictionary Definitions * Note : SECTIONS , PARTS , and GROUPINGS have additional connections not shown which lead to a related primitive cluster dealing with the PART/WHOLE concept  . 
This complex interrelated set of definitions comprise a primitive concept  , essentially equivalent to the notion of SET in mathematics  . The primitiveness of the set is evident when one attempts to define any one of the above words without using another of them in that definition  . 

This essential property , the inability to write a definition explain ing a word's meaning without using another member of some small set of near synonymous words  , is the basis for describing such a set as a PRIMITIVE  . It is based upon the notion of definition given by Wilder  \[21\]  , which in turn was based upon a presentation of the ideas of Padoa  , a turn-of-the-century logician . 
The definitions are given , the disambiguation of their kernel's senses leads to acyclic structure which cannot be resolved by attributing erroneous judgements to either the lexicographer or the disambiguator  ; therefore the structure is taken as representative of an undefinable pyimitive concept  , and the words whose definitions participate in this complex structure are found Cobe undefinable without reference to the other members of the set of undefined terms  . 
The question of what to do with such primitives is not really a problem  , as Winograd notes\[22\] , once one realizes that they must exist at some level  , just as mathematical primitives must exist . In tree construction the solution is to form a single node whose English surface representation may be selected from any of the words in the primitive set  . There probably are connotative differences between the members of the set  . 
but the ordinary pocket dictionary does not t reat these in its definitions with any detail  . The Merriam-Webster Collemfa Ce Dictionary does include so-called " synonym paragraphs " which seem to discuss the connotative dif ferences between words sharing a " ring "  . 
While numerous studies of lexical domains such as the verbs of motion \  [1   , 12  , 1 3 \] and possession \[10\] have been carried out by ocher researchers , it is worth noting that recourse to using ordinary dictionary definitions as a source of material has received little at tention  . 
Yet the " primitives " selected by Donald A . Norman , David E . Romelhart , and the LNR Research Group for knowledge representation in their system bear a remarkable similarity to those verbs used must often as kernels in The Merriam-Webster Pocket Dictionary and Donald Sherman has shown  ( Table 4 ) these topmost verbs to be among the most common verbs in the Collegiate Dictionary as wel l\  [19  \ ]  . The most frequent verbs of the MPD are , in descending order . MAKE , B E , BECOME , CAUSE , GIVE , MOVE , TAKE , PUT , FORM , BEING , HAVE . and GO . The similarity of these verbs to thoses e lected by the LNH group for their semantic representations  , i . e . , BECOME , CAUSE , CHANGE , DO , MOVE . POSS("have "), T~SF (" give ", " take "), etc . , \[10 . 14 . 18\] is striking . This similarity is indicative of an underlying " rightness " of dictionary definitions and supports the proposition that the lexical information extractable frca study of the dict ionary will prove to be the same knowledge needed for computational linguistics  . 
The enumeration of the primitives for nouns and verbs by analysis of the tangled hierarchies of the noun and verb forests grown from the MPD definitions is a considerable undertaking and one which goes beyond the scope of this paper  . To see an example of how this technique works in practice  , consider the discovery of the primitive group starting from  PLACE-1  . 3A . 
place-l . 3a - a bu i ld ing or loca l i ty used fo r a special purpose The kernels of this definit ionare " building " and " locality "  . Lookiog these up in turn we have : building- . laausu . roofed and wailed structure ( as a house ) for permanent use locality- . 0 a a particular Sh Ot , situation , or location

TOoTHERNOUNS ORVERBS
In addition to terminating in " dictionary circles " or " loops "  , nouns also terminate in definitions which are actually text descriptions of case arguments of verbs or relationships to other nouns  . " Vehicle " is a fine example of the former , being as it were the canonical instrumental case argument of one sense of the verb " carry " or " transport "  . 
vehicle-a means of carrying or transport ing something ' ~ eaf " is an example of the le tter  , being defined as a part of a plant , leaf-ausu . flat and green out growth of a plant stem that is a unit of foliage and functions esp  . in photo synthesis . 
interaction of the PARTOF and ISA hierarchies.
Historically even Raphael \[17\] used a PARTOF relationship together with the ISA hierarchy of gig's deduction system  . What however is new is that I am not stating " leaf " is a part of a plant because of some need use this fact within a particular system's operation  . 
but " discovering " this in a published re ference source and noting that such informat i on results naturally from an effort to assemble the complete lexical structure of the dictionary  . 
2.4 PARTITIVES AND COLLECTIVES
Thus " leaf"isn't a type of anything . Even though under a strictly genus/differentia interpretation one would analyze " leaf " as being in an ISA relationship with " outgrowth "  , " outgrowth " hasn't a suitable homogeneous set of members and a better interpretation for modeling this definition would be to consider the " outgrowth of " phrase to signify apart/whole relationship between " leaf " and " plant "  . 
Hence we may consider the dictionary to have at least two taxonomic relationships  ( i . e . ISA and ISPART ) as well as additional relations explaining noun terminals as verb arguments  . One can also readily see that there will be taxonomic interactions among nodes connected across these relationship " bridges "  . 
While the parts of a plant will include the " leaves "  , " stem " , " roots " , etc . , the corresponding parts of any TYPE of plant may have further specifications added to their descriptions  . Thus " plant " specifies a functional form which can be further elaborated by descent down its ISA chain  . For example , a " frond " is a type of " leaf " , frond-ausu . large divided leaf ( as of a fern ) We knew from " leaf " that it was a normal outgrowth of a " plant "  , but now we see that " leaf " can be specialized , provided we get confirmation from the dictionary that a " fern " isa " plant "  .   ( Such confirmation is only needed if we grant " leaf " more than one sense meaning  , but words in the Pocket Dictionary do typically average  23 sense meanings )  . The definition of " fern " gives us the needed linkage  , offering , fern-any of a group off lower less seed less vascular green plants Thus we have a specialized name for the " leaf " appendage of a " plant " if that plant is a " fern "  . This can be represented as in Figure 6 .

This conclusion that there are two major transitive taxonomies and that they are related is not of course new  . Evens et al .  \[6 , 7\] have dealt with the PARTOF relationship as second only to the ISA relationship in importance  , and Fahlmen\[8 , 9\] has also discussed the As mentioned in Section  2  . 3 , the use of " outgrowth " in the definition of " leaf"causes problems in the taxonomy if we treat " outgrowth " as the true genus term of that definition  . This word is but one ~*- mple of a broad range of noun terminals which may be described as " par titives "  . A " partitive " may be defined as a noun wh ich serves as a general term for a PART of another large and often very non-homogeneous set of concepts  . 
Additionally . at the opposite end of the partitives ca le  , there is the class of " collectives " . Collectives are words which serve as a general term for a COLLECTION of other concepts  . 
The disambiguators often faced decisions as to whether some words were indeed the true semantic kernels of definitions  , and often found additional words in the de finitions which were more semantically appropriate to serve as the kernel--albei t they did not appear syntactically in the correct position  . Many of these terms were partitives and co llectives  . Figure 7 shows a set of partitives and collect ives which were extracted and classified by Gretchen Hazard and John White during the dic tionary project  . The terms under " group names " , " whole units " , and " system units " are collectives . 
Those under " individuators " . " piece units " . " space shapes " , " existential units " , " locus units " , and " event units " are partitives . These terms usually appeared in the syntactic frame " An of " and this additionally served to indicate their functional role  .
