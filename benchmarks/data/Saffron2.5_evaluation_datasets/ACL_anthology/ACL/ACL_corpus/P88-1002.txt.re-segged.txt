This paper describes an analysis of telegraphic fragments as regular structures  ( not errors ) handled by rn~n~nal extensions to a system designed for processing the standard language  . The modular approach which has been implemented in the Unlsys natural anguage processing system PUNDIT is based on a division of labor in which syntax regulates the occurrence and distribution of elided elements  , and semantics and pragumtics use the system's t and ard me chank ms to interpret them  . 
1. INTRODUCTION
Int\]~paper we discuss the syntactic , semantic , and pragmatic analysis of fragmentary sentences in English  . Our central claim is that these sentences , which have often been classified in the literature with truly erroneous input such as misspellings  ( see , for example , the work discussed in ~ wnsny 1980 , Thompson 1980 , Kwnsny 1981 , Sondheimer 1983 , Eustman 1981 , Jen-sen 1983\]) , are regular structures which can be processed by adding a small number of rules to the grammar and other components of the system  . The syntactic regularity of fragment structures has been demonstrated elsewhere  , notably in ~/ larsh 1983 , Hirschman 1983\] ; we will focus here upon the regularity of these structures across all levels of linguistic representation  . Because the syntactic component regularizes these structures into a formal most indistinguishable from full tThis work has been supported in part by DARPA under contract  N00014-85-C-0012  , administered by the Office of Naval Research ; by National Science Foundation contract DCR-85-02205  ; and by Independent R~D fuudinz from Sys-tens Development Corporation  , ow part of UnisysCorporation .

assertions , the semantic and pragmatic components are able to interpre them with few or no extensions to existing mechanisms  . This process of incremental regularisation of fragment struc-tures ~ is possible only within a linguistically modular system  . Furthermore , we claim that although fra~nents may occur more frequently in special-ised sublanguages than in the standard grammar  , they do not provide evidence that sublanguages are based on gra  , ~m * tical principles fundamentally different from those underlying standard languages  , as claimed by ~ its patrick 1986\] , for example . 
This paper is divided into five sections . The introductory section defines fragments and describes the scope of our work  . In the second section , we consider certain properties of sentence fragments which motivate a modular approach  . 
The third section describes our implementation of processing for fragments  , to which each component of the system makes a distinct contribution  . The fourth section describes the temporal analysis of fragments  . Finally , the fifth section discusses the status of sublanguages characterized by these telegraphic constructions  . 
We define fragments as regular structures which are distinguished from full assertions by a missing element or elements which are normally syntactically obligatory  . We distinguish them from errors on the basis of their regularity and consistency of interpretation  , and because they appear to be generated intentionally  . We are not denying the existence of true errors , nor that pro-ceasing sentences containing true errors may require sophisticated techniques and deep reasoning  . Rather , we are saying that fragments are distinct from errors  , and can be handled in a quite general fashion , with minimal extensions to normal processing . Because we base the definition of/ragmer , ton the absence of a syntactically are not considered to be fragmentary  , since this om ; ~ sion is conditioned heavily by sem?nt lc factors such?s the mass vs  . count distinction . However , we have implemented a pr?gm?tlcaliybased treatment of noun phrases without determiners  , which is briefly discussed in Section 3 . 
Fragments , then , ? redefined here as eli-slons . We describe below the way in which these or e ; ?? ions are detected and subsequently ' filled in ' by different modules of the system  . 
The problem of processing fragmentary sentences has arisen in the context of al?rge-scnle natural language processing research project conducted at UNIsYs over the past five years ~  al-mer1986  , Hirschman 1986 , Dowding 1987 , Dahl 1987\] . We have developed a portable , broadcoverage text-processing system , PUNDIT .   1 Our initial applications have involved v?r lons message types  , including : field engineering reports for maintenance of computers  ; Navy maintenance reports ( Casualty Reports , or CASR~S ) for starting air compressors ; Navy intelligence reports ( ~ m ~ roRm) ; trouble and f ? U ~ reports ( TE as ) from Navy Vessels ; and recently we have examined several medical domains  ( radiology reports , COmments fields from ? DNA sequence database) . 
At least half the sentences in these corpora are fragments  ; Table 1 below gives ? summary of the fragment content of three domains  , showing the percent of centers which are classified as fragments  .   ( Centers comprise all sentence types : assertions , questions , fragments , and so forth . )

The PUNDIT system is highly modular : it consists of a syntactic omponent  , based on string grammar and restriction grammar \ [   Sager1981  , Hirschman 1985\]; a semantic omponent , based on inference-driven mapping , which decomposes predicating expressions into predicates and thematic roles ~  almer1983  , Palmerlg 85\] ; and a pragmatic ? component which processes both referring expressions ~  ) ah11986\] , and temporal expressions ~ as sonneau 1987 , Passonneau 1988\] .

TAX , SEMANTICS , ANDPRAGMATICS
We argue here that sentence fragments provide a strong case for linguistically modular systems such as PUNDIT  , because suchelislons have distinct consequences ? t different levels of linguistic description  . Our approach to fragments can be snmm?rlsed by saying that syntax detects ' holes ' in surface structure and creates dummy elements as piace holders for the missing elements  ; semantics and pragmatics interpret these placeholders at the appropriate point in sentence processing  , utllising the same mechanisms for fragments?s for full assertions  . 
Syntax regulates the holes . Fragmente Usions cannot be accounted for in purely semant lc/pragmaticer ms  . This is evidenced by the fact that there?re syntactic restriction so nom  ; nlons ; the acceptability of a sentence fragment hinges on gramm?t l cal factors rather than  , e . g . , how readily the elided material can be inferred from context  . For example , the discourse Old howe too small . * New one ~ be larger titan_was ( where the elided object of t ~ an is understood to be old howe  ) is Ul-formed , whereas a comparable discourse First repair man ordered new aire on ditiom ~ r  . Second repair man will in ltali_ ( where the elided object of in J to // is understood to beai reoad it loas r  ) is acceptable . In both cases above , the referent of the elided element is available from context  , and yet only the second elilps is sounds wellformed  . Thus ? nap preciation of where such ellipses may occur is part of the lingu  , t/e knowledge of speakers of English and not simply a function of the contextual salience of elided elements  . Since these restrictions concern structure rather than content  , they would be d ; ~cultor impossible to state in ? system such?s a'pure'semantic grammar which only recognised such omissions at the level of semantic/pragmatic representation  . 
Furthermore , it matters to semantics and pragmatic ? HOW an argument is omitted  . The syntactic omponent must tell sem?nt lcs whether a verb argument is re  ; Ringbec?use the verb is used intransitively ( as in The tiger was eating , where the patient argument is not specified ) or because of ? fragment ellipsis ( as in Eatenbl/atiger , where the patient argument is missing because the subject of a passive sentence has been elided  )  . Only in the latter case does the missing argument of eat function ? s ? n antecedent subsequently in the discourse : compare Eaten by a tiler  . Hadm creamed bloody murder right before tKe attack  ( where the victim and the screamer are the same ) vs . TKetiger tease at ing . 
Had screamed bloody murder right before tKe attack  ( where it is dlmcnltor impossible to get the reading in which the victim and the screamer are the same  )  . 
Semantles and pragmstlesfill the holes.
In PUNDIT's treatment of fragments , each component contributes exactly what is appropriate to the specification of elided elements  . Thus the syntax does not attempto ' fill in ' the holes that it discovers  , unless that information is completely predictable given the structure at hand  . Instead , it creates ? dummy element . If the missing element is an elided subject , then the dummy element created by the syntactic component is assigned a referent by the pragmatics component  . 
This referent is then assigned ? thematic role by the semantics componentllke any other referent  , and is subject to any select lonal restrictions atom-cinted with the thematic role assigned to it  . If the missing element is a verb , it is specified in either the syntactic or the semantic component  , depending upon the fragmentype . 
. PROCESSING FRAGMENTSINP UN-
DIT
Although the initial PUNDIT system wude signed to handle full  , as opposed to fragmentary , sentences , one of the interesting results of our work is that it has required only very minor changes to the system to handle the basic fragment types introduced below  . These included the additions of : 6 fragment BNF definitions to the grammar ( a 5~ increase in grammar size ) and 7 context-sensitive rstrictions ( a 12 ~ o increase in the number of restrictions )  ; one semantic rule for the interpret ?? ion of the dummy element inserted for missing verbs  ; ? minor modification to the reference resolution mechanism to treat elided noun phrases llke pronouns  ; and a small addition to the temporal processing mechanism to handle tense less fragments  . The small number of changes to the semantic and pragmatic components reflects the fact that these components are not ' aware ' that they are interpreting fragmentary structures  , because the regularls at lonper formed by the syntactic component renders them structurally indistinguishable from full assertions  . 
Fragments present parsing problems because the ellipsis creates degenerate structures  . For example , ? sequence such as cheer negative can be analysed as a ' sero-copuia ' fragment meaning the chest X -rayim negative  , or ? noun compound llketKene fative of the ehe , LThis is compounded by the lack of deriv?tional and inflectional morphology in English  , so that in many cases it may not be possible to distinguish ? noun from ? verb  ( repair parts ) or a past tense from a past participle ( decreased medication )  . Adding fragment definitions to the grammar ( especially if determiner om ; Mionis ?\] so allowed ) results in ? n explosion of ambiguity . This problem has been noted and discussed by Kwasny and Sondheimer ~  wasny1981\]  . Their solution to the problem is to suggest special relax ? ? i on techniques for the analysis of fragments  . However , in keeping with our thesis that fragments are normal constructions  , we have chosen the alternative of constraining the explosion of parses in two ways  . 
The first is the addition of ? control structure to implement ai  ; m ; ted form of preference via ' unbacktr?ckable ' or  ( xor )  . This binary operator tries its second argument only if its first argument does not lead to ? parse  . In the grammar , this is used to prefer " the most structured " alternative  . That is , full assertions are preferred over fragments-if an assertion or other non-fragment parse is obtained  , the parser does not try for ? fragment parse . 
The second mechanism that helps to control generation of incorrect parses is selection  . PUNDIT applies surface select lonal constraints incrementally  , as the parse is built up ~ ang 1988\] . For example , the phrase air compressor would NOT be allowed as ? serocopnla because the construction air is eompree  #or would fall selection  , s8 . 1 . Fragment Types The fragment types currently treated in 
PUNDIT include the following:
Zero copula : a subject followed by ? predicate , differing from a full clause only in the absence of ? verb  , as in ImpeU or bladetiperosion eviden ~ Tvo ( tensed verb+object ) : a sentence m ; ~ing its subject , as in Believe the coupling from diesel to lac lube oil pump to be reheated  ; sSimilarly , the assertion parse for the title of this paper would fail selection  ( sentences don't frngment structures )  , permitting these rocopuin fragment pLrse . 
Nst~ . ag : an isolated noun phrase ( noun-string fragment )  , as in Louo/o ~ primp preuure . 
ObJlze_frag ( object-of-be fragment ) : an isolated complement appropriate to the main verb be  , as in Unable to e on J . tenffyItart nrlb gaaturbine ; Predicate : an isolated complement appropriate to a ~ ary be  , as in Believed due to worn b~h-ingJ , where the full sentence counterpart is Failure 14 believed ( to be ) due tou or nb ~ hlnfm ; sObj . .gap_flea&qnent : a center ( assertion , question , or other fragment structure ) mining an obli-gatory noun phrase object , as in Field engineer t ~ l replace_Note that we do not address here the processing of reapon ~ e frafmen ~ which occur in interactive discourse  , typically as responses to questions . 
The relative frequency of these six fragment types  ( expressed as a percentage of the total fragment content of each corpus  ) is summarised below . '

The processing of these basic fragment types can besvmm ~ rlsed briefly as follows : a detailed surface parse tree is provided which represents the overt lexical content in its surface order  . At this level , fragments bear very little resemblance to full assertions  . But at the level of the Intermediate S~/ntac ~ e Representation  ( ISR )  , s It is interesting to note that at least some of these types of fragments resemble non-frnsmentary structures in other languages  , two fragments , for m--Lmple , can be compared to sero-subject sentences in Japanese  , seroeopulas resemble copular sentences in Arabic and Russian  , and strue-tures similar to predlcate can be found in Cantonese  ( our thanks to K . Fu for the Cantonese data ) . This being the case , it is not surprising that analozoue sentences in Englkh can be processed without resorting to ext r a ~ i m m n t i c z d m e ch a n i s m s c  4 ZC--sero copula ; NF = - ustg_fragment ; PRED- , predicate ; OBJBE , -obj ba_frag ; OBJ_GAP-obj . .L~p_fraEment . 
which is a regularized representation fsyntactic structure ~  ) ah11987 . .\] , fragments are regularized to paranel full assertions by the use of dummy elements tanding in for them lasing subject or verb  . The CONTENT of these dummy elements , however , is left unspecified in most cases , to be filled in by the semantic or pragmatic omponents of the system  . 
Tvo . We consider first the tvo , a subject less tensed clause such as Operate , nort on/Ill . This is parsed as a sequence of tensed verb and object : no subject is inferred at the level of surface structure  . In the ISR , the missing subject is fined in by the dnmmy element elided  . At the level of the ISR , then , the fragment operates norma/f ~/ differs from a full assertion such as \] t operates norm a U ~/ only by virtue of the element elided in place of snovert pronoun  . The element elided is asslgned a referent which subsequently fills a thematic role  , exactly as if it were a pronoun ; thus these two sentences get the same treatment from semantics and reference resolutlon ~  ) ah11986 , Pal-mer 1988\] . 
Elided subjects in the domains we have looked at often refer to the writer of the report  , so one strategy for interpreting them might be simply to assume that the filler of the elided sub-Sect is the writer of the report  . This simple strategy is not snl B clent in all cases  . For example , in the CASREPS corpus we observe sequences such as the following  , where the filler of the elided sub-Sect is provided by the previous sentence  , and is clearly not the writer of the report . 
( i ) Problem appears to be caused by one or more of two hydraulic valves  . Requires disassembly and investigation . 
(2 ) Saclubeoll pressure decreases below alarm point approximately seven minutes after engagement  . Believed due to worn bushings . 
Thus , it is necessary to be able to treatelided subjects as pronouns in order to handle these sentences  . 
The effect of an elided subject on subsequent focusing is the same as that of an overt pronoun  . We demonstrated in section 2 that elided subjects , but not semantically implicit arguments , are expected loci ( or forward-looklng centers\[Gross1988\] ) for later sentences . 

The basic assumption underlying this treatment is that the pragmatic analysis for elided subjects should be as re  ; re ; far to that of pronouns as possible . One piece of supporting evidence for this assumption is that in many languages  , such as Japanese\[Gundel 1980 , l-nnds 1983 ,   Kameyama1985\] the functional equivalent of unstressed pronouns in English is a sere  , or elided noun phrase , s If seres in other languages can correspond to unstressed pronouns in English  , then we hypothesise that seres in a sublunguage of English can correspond functionally to pronouns in standard English  . In addition , since pro-ceasing of pronouns is independently motlvated  , it is a prior is impler to try to fitelision Into the pronominal paradigm  , if possible , than to create an entirely separate component for handling elision  . 
Under this hypothesis , then , tvo fragments represent 8~ply a realization of a grammatical strategy that is generally available to languages of the world  , sZeroeopula . For aser o copuia ( e . g . , D~Jk bad ) , the surface parse tree rather than the ISR inserts adnmmy verb  , In order to enforce subcategorization constraints on the object  . And In the ISR , this null verb is ' filled in ' as the verb be . 
It is possible to fill in the verb at this level because no further semantic or pragmatic information is required in order to determ  ; neits content .   7 Hence the representation for D~kbad is nearly indistinguishable from that assigned to the corresponding /  ) /Ik/sbad ; the only difference is in the absence of tense from the former  . If the null verb represents an ~ lls Lry be , then , like an overtan ~ I ; ary , it does not appear in the regularised form . Sac . failing thus receives a regular is at lon with/ai /as the main verb  . Thus the null verb inserted in the syntax is treated in the ISRilla fashion exactly parallel to the treatment of overtt Stressed pronouns in Eugiish corrup on d to overt pronouns in lanzua  , reslike Japanese . u discummd in \[ Gun-dell 980 , Gundellg 81 J , and \[ Dahl 1982 J . 
tAn interesting hypothesis , discussed by Gundel and Kameyama , is that the more topic prominent a language is , the more likely it is to have sero-NP's . Perhaps the fact that sublangusge mumn ~ J are characterised by rigid  , contextualiy supplied , topics contributes to the availability of thery e fragment type in English  . 
7In some restricted subdomains , however , other verbs may be omitted : for example , in certain radiology reports an omitted verb may be interpreted u  , hew rather than be .

Nstg- . ~ ag . The syntactic parse tree for this fragmentype contains no empty elements  ; it is a regular noun phrase , labeled as an nstg_f ~ aK . The ISR transforms it into a VSO sequence . This is done by treating it as the sub-Sect of an element empty_verb  ; in the semantic component , he subject of empty_verb is treated as the sole argument of a predicate exlstent lsl  ( X )   . As a result , then stg_fragFai/ureo\[see and a synonymous assertion such as Failureo  . fsacoc curred are eventually mapped onto s ; rnil ~ r final representations by virtue of the temporal semantics of empty_verb and of the bead of the noun phrase  . 
Obj be_/~ag and predicate . These are iso-inted complements ; the same devices described above are utillsed in their processing  . The surface parse tree of these fragmentypes contains no empty elements  ; as with seroeopula , the unteused verb be is inserted into the ISR ; as with tvo , the dnr-my subject elided is also inserted in the ISR  , to be filled in by reference resolution . 
Thus the simple adjective In operatiee will receive an ISR quites  ; rn ; lsr to that of . ~ e/,Ise/it ~ ino-perative . 
ObJ_gap_~agment . The final fragment type to be considered here is the elided noun phrase object  . Such object elisio ca occur more widely in English in the context of instructions  , as in Handle _udt Aser e . Cookbooks are especially wellknown respositories of elided objects  , presumably because they are filled with instructions  . 
Object elision also occurs in telegrarnmatic sublanguages generally  , as in Took_under . ~ reud ~ m , e ~ es from the Navy sighting messages . If these omissions occurred only indirect object position following the verb  , one might argue for a lexlcal treatment ; that is , such omissions could be treated as a lexl cal process of intransitivisation rather than by explicitly representing gaps in the syntactic structure  . However , noun phrase objects of prepositions may also be omitted  , as in FraCas . 
Donottamper ~ th_ . Thus we have chosen to represent suchelis lons with an explicit surface structure gap  . This gap is permitted in most contexts where nstKo  ( noun phrase object ) is found : as a direct object of the verb and as an object of a preposition  . 8In PUNDIT , elided objects ares Note , however , that there are some restrictions on the occur rence of these elements  . They seem not to occur in obj_gap_f kagment , which , llke other fragment types , may be attempted only if an assertion parse has failed  . Thus a sentence such as Pressure was c/stressing rap~ffy will never be analysed as containing an elided object  , because there is a semantically acceptable assertion parse  . In con-trust , Johts ~ as deere ~ in fgr ~ uag\[I/will receive an elided object analysis  , paraphrasable as Joh ~ w ~ deere ~ i ~ fIT gradua ~ v , because Jo~n is not an acceptable subject of intransitive Jeere ~ e  ; only pressure or some equally mensurablentity may be said to decrease  . This selectional failure of the assertion parse permits the elided object analysis  . 
Our working hypothesis for determ ; u ; uS the reference of object gaps is that they are , just llke subject gaps , appropriately treated as pronouns . 
However , we have not as yet seen extensive data relevant o this hypothesis  , and it remain subject to further testing . 
These , then , are the fragment types currently Inzplemented In PUNDIT  . As mentioned above , we do not consider noun phrases without determ ; -ers to be fragments , because it is not clear that the missing element is symf~f~e~y obligatory  . The Interpretation of these noun phrases is treated as a pragmatic problem  . In the style of speech characteristic of the CASREPs  , determ ; uers are nearly always omitted . Their function must therefore be replaced by other mechanisms  . One possible approach to this problem would be to have the system try to determine what the determ  ; uer would have been , had there been one , insert it , and then resume processing as if the detervn ; ner had been there all along . This approach was taken by ~ V\[arsh1981\] . However , it was rejected here for two reasons . The first is that it was judged to be more error -prone than simply equipping the reference resolution component with the ability to handle noun phrases without determiners directly  . 0 The second reason predicative objects , in double dative constructions , and , perhaps , in sentence adjuncts rather than arguments of the verb  . ( Thus compare P4 fiesfeer tfd/ . .Do sot opersfe os with Opersti ~ room cloud os Snadslt  . Donorpe ~ om ~ r-gcIToz . . ) One po~ibility is that these x preruione can occur only where a definite pronoun would also be acceptable  . In general , object pps seemmcet acceptable where they represent an argument ot n verb  , either as direct object or u object of a preposition selected for by a verb  . 
This ability would be required in any case , should the system be extended to process languages which do not have for not selecting this approach is that it would elm  ; uate the distinction between noun phrases which originally had a determiner and those which did not  . At some point in the development of the system it may become necessary to use this information ? The basic approach currently taken is to assume that the noun phrase is definite  , that is , it triggers a search through the discourse context for a previously mentioned referent  . If the search succeeds , the noun phrase is assumed to refer to that entity  . If the search fans , z new discourse entity is created . 
In summary , then , these fragmentypes are parsed ' as is ' at the surface level  ; dummy elements are inserted Into the ISR to bring fragments into close parallelism with fuil assertions  . 
Because of the resulting structurals ; m ; l ~ rlty between these two sentence types , the semantic and pragmatic omponents can apply exactly the same Interpretive processes to both fragments and assertions  , using preexisting mechanisms to ' fluIn'the holes detected by syntax  . 
4. TEMPORAL ANALY SISO FFI~G-

Temporal processing of fragmentary sentences further supports the efficacy of a modular approach to the analysis of these strings  . 1 ? In PUNDIT ' S current message domains , a single assumption leads to assignment of present or past tense in untensed fragments  , depending on the nspectual properties of the fragment  , lz This assumption is that the messages report on actual situations which are of present relevance  . Consequently , the default tense assignment is present unless th ~ prevents assigning an actual time  .   1~ For sentences having progressive grammatical aspect or statl ve lexical aspect  , the assignment of presentense always permits interpreting articl ~  1?For a discussion of the temporal component , of .

A non-progressive srocopula fragment containing ? cognitive state verb  , as in / a ~ ure believed due to wowbushings , is assigned ? present tense reading . However , if the lexlc?l verb has nonstative aspect , Ise . g . , tss ~ eomluetsd ( process ) or news ac received ( transition event ) then assignment of present tense conflicts with the assumption that the mentioned situation has occurred or is occurring  . The slmple present tense form of verbs in this class is given ? habi-tual or iterative reading  . That is , the corresponding full sentences in the present , tss ~ are conducted and nelosac ~ reeelved , are interpreted as referring to types of situations that tend to occur  , rather than to situations that have occurred . In order to permit actual temporal reference , these fragments are assigned ? past tense reading . 
Nst~/~ag represents another case where present tense may conflict with lexical aspect  . If ? nnmtg_frag refers to ? non-st ? tire situation  , the situation is interpreted as having an actual past time  . This can be the case if the head of the noun phrase is ? nom  ; nall sation , and is derived from ? verb in the processor tr ? nslt lonevent aspectual class  . Thus , in eestlgation of problem would be interpreted as an actual process which took place prior to the report time  , and ~ irnilurly , sac/ai/ure would be interpreted?s ? past trans i-t o n event  . On the other hand , an nstff~raJ ? which refers to ? st ? tire situation  , as in i ~ opera - ~ ie epump , is assigned presentense . 
5. RELATION OF FRAGMENTS TO THE
LARGERG ~
An important finding which has emerged from the investigation of sentence fragments in a variety of sublanguage domains is that the linguistic properties of these constructions are largely domain-independent  . A ~ n rnrlg that these sentence fragments remain constant across different sublanguages  , what is their relationship to the language at large ? As indicated above  , weIsMourelat ~' class of occurrences \ [ Mourelatoslg81\]  . 
believe that fragment should not be regarded as ERRORS  , ? position taken also by ~ ehrberger 1982 , Marsh 1983\] , and others . Fragments do occur with disproportionate frequency in some domains  , such as field reports of mechanical failure or newspaper headlines  . However , despite this frequency v ? riatlon , it appears that the parser's preferences remain constant ? cross domains  . 
Therefore , even in telegraphic domains the preference is for ? full assertion parse  , if one is available . As discussed above , we have enforced this preference by means of the xor  ( ' unbacktrack-able ' or ) connective . Thus despite the greater frequency of fragments we do not require either ? gr?mm * ror ? preference structure different from that of standard English in order to apply the stable system ~ rammlr to these telegraphic messages  . 
Others have argued against this view of the relationship between sublanguages and the language at large  . For example , F its patrlck et al ~ itspatrick1986\] propose that fragments are subject to ? constraint quite unlike any found in English generally  . Their Tr*n * ltl vity Con-straint ( TC ) requires that if ? verb occurs as ? transitive in ? sublanguage with fragmentary messages  , then it may not also occur in an intransitive form  , even if the verb is ambiguous in the language at large  . This constraint , they argue , provides evidence that sublanguage gramm , ,rs have " ? llfe of their own " , since there is no such principle governing standard languages  . The TC would also cut down on ambiguities arising out of object deletion  , since ? verb would be permitted to occur transitively or intransltlve \] y in ? given subdomain  , but not both . 
As the authors recogulse , this hypothesis runs in totllt ~ culty in the face of verbs such as resume  ( we find both Sacresumed norm ~ opera-tlon and No ~ e\]~am resumed  )  , since resume occurs both transitively and intransitively in these cases  . 
For these cases , the authors are forced to appeal to a problematic analysis of resume as syntacti-caliy transitive in both cases  ; they analyse TKe~o~e/sue resumed , for example , as deriving from a structure of the form CS ome one /aomething J resumed tKcnose  ; that is , it is analysed as under-lying iy transitive . Other transitivity alternations which present potential counterexamples are treated as syntactic gapping processes  . In fact , with these two mechanisms available , it is not clear what COULD provide a counterexample to render the Transitivity Constraint vacuous  . If all transtive/in translt vealtrnations can be treated as underlying y transitive  , then of course there w in be no counterexamples to the transitivity constraint  . Therefore we seen o evidence that sublanguage grammars are subject to additional constraints of this nature  . 
Insnmm * ry , this supports the view that fragmentary constructions in English are regular  , gramm~t caliy constrained ellipses differing minimally from the standard language  , rather than ill-formed , unpredictable sublanguage exo-tl ca . ~ Vithlna modular system such as PUNDIT this regularity can be captured with the l~rn~ted augmentations of the gramms r described above  .
