This paper describes a method of detecting grammatical and lexical errors made by Japanese learners of English and other techniques that improve the accuracy of error detection with a limited amount of training data  . In this paper , we demonstrate to what extent the proposed methods hold promise by conducting experiments using our learner corpus  , which contains information on learners ? errors . 
1 Introduction
One of the most important things in keeping up with our current information-driven society is the acquisition of foreign languages  , especially English for international communications  . In developing a computer-assisted language teaching and learning environment  , we have compiled a largescale speech corpus of Japanese learner English  , which provides a great deal of useful information on the construction of a model for the developmental stages of Japanese learners ? speaking abilities  . 
In the support system for language learning , we have assumed that learners must be informed of what kind of errors they have made  , and in which part of their utterances . To do this , we need to have a framework that will allow us to detect learners ? errors automatically  . 
In this paper , we introduce a method of detecting learners ? errors  , and we examine to what extent this could be accomplished using our learner corpus data including error tags that are labeled with the learners ? errors  . 
2 SST Corpus
The corpus data was based entirely on audio -recorded data extracted from an interview test  , the ? Standard Speaking Test ( SST )? . The SST is a face-to-face interview between an examiner and the test-taker  . In most cases , the examiner is a native speaker of Japanese who is officially certified to be an SST examiner  . All the interviews are audio-recorded , and judged by two or three raters based on an SST evaluation scheme  ( SST levels 1 to 9 )  . We recorded 300 hours of data , totaling one million words , and transcribed this . 
2.1 Error tags
We designed an original error tagset for learners ? grammatical and lexical errors  , which were relatively easy to categorize . Our error tags contained three pieces of information  , i . e . , the part of speech , the grammatical/lexical system and the corrected form  . We prepared special tags for some errors that cannot be categorized into any word class  , such as the misordering of words . Our error tagset currently consists of 45 tags . The following example is a sentence with an error tag  .

By referring to information on the corrected form indicated in an error tag  , the system can convert erroneous parts into corrected equivalents  . 
3 Error detection method
In this section , we would like to describe how we proceeded with error detection in the learner corpus  . 
3.1 Types of errors
We first divided errors into two groups depending on how their surface structures were different from those of the correct ones  . The first was an ? omission ?- type error , where the necessary word was missing , and an error tag was inserted to interpolate it . The second was a ? replacement ?- type error , where the erroneous word was enclosed in an error tag to be replaced by the corrected version  . We applied different methods to detecting these two kinds of errors  . 
3.2 Detection of omission-type errors
Omission-type errors were detected by estimating whether or not a necessary word string was missing in front of each word  , including delimiters . We also estimated to which category the error belonged during this process  . What we call ? error categories ? here means the 45 error categories that are defined in our error tagset  . ( e . g . article and tense errors ) These are different from ? error types ? ( omission or replacement )  . As we can see from Fig .  1 , when more than one error category is given , we have two ways of choosing the best one . 
Method A allows us to estimate whether there is a missing word or not for each error category  . This can be considered the same as deciding which of the two labels  ( E : ? There is a missing word . ? or C : ? There is no missing word . ?) should be inserted in front of each word . Here , there is an article missing in front of ? telephone ?  , so this can be considered an omission-type error , which is categorized as an article error ( ? at ? is a label that indicates that this is an article error  . ) . In Method B , if N error categories come up , we need to choose the most appropriate error category ? k ? from among  N+1 categories , which means we have added one more category ( +1 ) of ? There is no missing word . ? ( labeled with ? C ?) to the N error categories . This can be considered the same as putting one of the  N+1 labels in front of each word . If there is more than one error tag inserted at the same location  , they are combined to form a new error tag . 
As we can see from Fig .  2 , we referred to 23 pieces of information to estimate the error category : two preceding and following words  , their word classes , their root forms , three combinations of these ( one preceding word and one following word/two preceding words and one following word/one preceding word and two following words  )  , and the first and last letter of the word immediately following  . ( In Fig . 2, ? t ? and ? e ? in ? telephone ? . ) The word classes and root forms were acquired with ? TreeTagger ?  . ( Shmid 1994) 3 . 3 Detection of replacement-type errors Replacement -type errors were detected by estimating whether or not each word should be deleted or replaced with another word string  . The error category was also estimated during this process  . As we did in detecting omission-type errors , if more than one error category was given , we use two methods of detection . Method C was used to estimate whether or not the word should be replaced with another word for each error category  , and if it was to be replaced , the model estimated whether the word was located at the beginning  , middle or end of the erroneous part . As we can see from Fig . 3, this can be considered the Figure 2 . Features used for detecting omission-type errors

C same as deciding which of the three labels ( Eb : ? The word is at the beginning of the erroneous part  . ?, Ee : ? The word is in the middle or end . ? or C : ? The word is correct . ?) must be applied to each word . Method D was used if N error categories came up and we chose an appropriate one for the word from among  2N+1 categories .   ?2N+1 categories ? means that we divided N categories into two groups  , i . e . , where the word was at the beginning of the erroneous part and where the word was not at the beginning  , and we added one more where the word neither needed to be deleted nor replaced  . This can be considered the same as attaching one of the  2N+1 labels to each word . To do this , we applied Ramshaw?s IOB scheme ( Lance 1995) . If there was more than one error tag attached to the same word  , we only referred to the tag that covered the highest number of words  . 
As Fig . 4 reveals ,   32 pieces of information are referenced to estimate an error category  , i . e . , the targeted word and the two preceding and following words  , their word classes , their root forms , five combinations of these ( the targeted word , the one preceding and one following/the targeted word and the one preceding/the targeted word and the one following/the targeted word and the two preceding/the targeted word and the two following  )  , and the first and last letters of the word . 
3.4 Use of machine learning model
The Maximum Entropy ( ME ) model ( Jaynes 1957 ) is a general technique that is used to estimate the probability distributions of data  . The overriding principle in ME is that when nothing is known  , the distribution should be as uniform as possible  , i . e . , maximum entropy . We calculated the distribution of probabilities p ( a , b ) with this method when Eq . 1 was satisfied and Eq . 2 was maximized . We then selected the category with maximum probability  , as calculated from this distribution of probabilities  , to be the correct category .

B b A a B b A a j j b a p b a p p H k j f for bag ba x ba p We assumed that the constraint of feature sets fi  ( i ? j ? k ) was defined by Eq .  1 . This is where A is a set of categories and B is a set of contexts  , and gj(a , b ) is a binary function that returns value 1 when feature fj exists in context b and the category is a  . Otherwise , gj(a , b ) returns value 0 . p~(a , b ) is the occurrence rate of the pair ( a , b ) in the training data .

C 4.2 Experiment based on tagged data
We obtained data from 56 learners ? with error tags . We used 50 files ( 5599 sentences ) as the training data , and 6 files (617 sentences ) as the test data . 
We tried to detect each error category using the methods discussed in Sections  3  . 2 and 3 . 3 . There were some error categories that could not be detected because of the lack of training data  , but we have obtained the following results for article errors which occurred most frequently  . 
Article errors
Omission-Recall rate 8/71* 100 = 32 . 39(%) type errors Precision rate 8/11* 100 = 52 . 27(%) Replacement-Recall rate 0/43* 100 = 9 . 30 (%) type errors Precision rate 0/1* 100 = 22 . 22(%) Results for 13 errors were as follows . 
All errors
Omission-Recall rate 21/93* 100 = 22 . 58 (%) type errors Precision rate 21/38* 100 = 55 . 26(%) Replacement-Recall rate 5/224* 100 = 2 . 23(%) type errors Precision rate 5/56* 100 = 8 . 93 ( % ) We assumed that the results were inadequate because we did not have sufficient training data  . 
To overcome this , we added the correct sentences to see how this would affect the results  . 
4.3 Addition of corrected sentences
As discussed in Section 2 . 1 , our error tags provided a corrected form for each error  . If the erroneous parts were replaced with the corrected forms indicated in the error tags one - by-one  , ill-formed sentences could be converted into corrected equivalents  . We did this with the 50 items of training data to extract the correct sentences and then added them to the training data  . We also added the interviewers ? utterances in the entire corpus data  ( totaling 1202 files , excluding 6 that were used as the test data ) to the training data as correct sentences . We added a total of 104925 correct new sentences . The results we obtained by detecting article errors with the new data were as follows  . 
Article errors
Omission-Recall rate 8/71* 100 = 11 . 27 (%) type errors Precision rate 8/11* 100 = 72 . 73(%) Replacement-Recall rate 0/43* 100 = 0 . 00 (%) type errors Precision rate 0/1* 100 = 0 . 00 ( % ) We found that although the recall rate decreased , the precision rate went up through adding correct sentences to the training data  . 
We then determined how we could improve the results by adding the artificially made errors to the training data  . 
4 . 4 Addition of sentences with artificially made errors We did this only for article errors  . We first examined what kind of errors had been made with articles and found that ? a ?  , ? an ? , ? the ? and the absence of articles were often confused  . We made uppseudo-errors just by replacing the correctly used articles with one of the others  . The results of detecting article errors using the new training data  , including the new corrected sentences described in Section  4  . 2 , and 7558 sentences that contained artificially made errors were as follows  . 
Article errors
Omission-Recall rate 24/71* 100 = 33 . 80 (%) type errors Precision rate 24/30* 100 = 80 . 00 (%) Replacement-Recall rate 2/43* 100 = 4 . 65 (%) type errors Precision rate 2/9* 100 = 22 . 22 ( % ) We obtained a better recall and precision rate for omission-type errors  . 
There were no improvements for replacement-type errors  . Since some more detailed context might be necessary to decide whether ? a ? or ? the ? must be used  , the features we used here might be insufficient . 
5 Conclusion
In this paper , we explained how errors in learners ? spoken data could be detected and in the experiment  , using the corpus as it was , the recall rate was about 30% and the precision rate was about 50%  . By adding corrected sentences and artificially made errors  , the precision rate rose to 80% while the recall rate remained the same .
