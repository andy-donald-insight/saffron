When computer programs disambiguate words in a sentence  , they often encounter nonliteral or novel usages not included in their lexicon  . In a recent study , Georgia Green ( personal communication ) estimated that 17% to 20% of the content word senses encountered in various types of normal English text are not fisted in the dictionary  . While these novel word senses are generally valid  , they occur in such great numbers , and with such little individual frequency that it is impractical to expli-city include them all within the lexicon  . Instead , mechanisms are needed which can derive novel senses from existing ones  ; thus allowing a program to recognize a significant set of potential word senses while keeping its lexicon within a reasonable size  . 
Spreading activation is a mechanism that allows us to do this  . Here the program follows paths from existing word sense stored in a semantic network to other closely associated word senses  . By examining the shape of the resultant path , we can determine the relationship between the senses con-~ned in the path  ; thus deriving novel composite meanings not contained within any of the original lexical entries  . This process is similar to the spreading activation and marker passing techniques of Hirst  \[1988\]  , Charniak\[1986\] , and Norvig \[1989\] and is embodied in the Prolog programmet allel based on 
Fass'programmeta5(Fass\[1988\]).
Metallel's lexicon is written as a series of sense frames  , each containing information about a particular word sense  . A sense frame can he broken into two main parts : genera and differentia e  . Gen-era are the genus terms that function as the ancestors of a word sense  . Differentiae denote the qualities that distinguish a particular sense from other senses of the same genus  . Differentia e can be broken down into source and target which hold  , respectively , the preference stand properties of a sense . Source con-=dns differentia emform ~ on concen~g another word sense  . Target in focma ~ on concerns the sense itself . 
Connections can be found to other word senses in one of two ways : through an ancestor relationship  ( genus ) erthrough a preference or property relationship ( differentia )  . In the case of differentiae , it is necessary to extract he word senses from a higher order structure  . For example , \[ it(n , z ) , contain ( v , l ) , n  ~ asic(n , Z ) \] is not a word sens ? ~ at is LL~ted in the lexicon  , while ~ asic(n , i ) is Us ~ LIt is therefore necessary to ex~act rausic  ( n , Z ) from the larger dffferead as ~ ucmre which it occurs and add it to the path  . 
Not all paths are valid , indicating that some criteria of acceptability are neede during analysis  . 
In addition , paths that are superficially different often end up being quite similar upon further analysis  . 
Keeping this in mind , we have attempted to identify path schemata and associate the mwkh types of nonliteral usage  . Specifically , we have concentrated on identifying instances of metaphor and metonymy  . 
A metaphorical path schema is one in which the preference of a verb and the actual target of the preference both reference different  3 place differen-tia e 2 which can be said to be related .

3 43 differentiae are related if both their respective rob-jeers and objects are identical or form a " sister " relationship  3  . Additict mlly , the two verbs of the dif-ferentiae as well as the verb which generated the preference must have a simila relationship 
The shipploughed the waves.
ship(n , 1)-anc->watercraft(n , 1)-prop->\[it(n , i ) , sail(v ,  2) , water(n , 2)\]-link->water(n , 2)-anc -> environment(n , I ) <- anc-soil(n , I ) <- link-\[it(n ,  1) , plough(v ,  2) , so il(n , 1)\] <- prop-plough(n , 1) <- inst-plough(v , i)-ohj->soil(n , 1)-ant -> environment(n , I ) <- ant-water(n , 2) <- part-wave(n , I ) For example in the path for the senw . nce The shipploughed the waves , \[ it(n ,  1) , sail(v ,  2) , water(n , i)\]and\[it(n ,  1) , plough(v ,  2) , so il(n , 1)\] are related ~ plough(v ,  1) , plough(v , 2) and sail ( v , 2) a ~ ch ~ dlP ~ of transfer(v , i ) , and water(n , I ) and so il(n , I ) ai ~ ch ~ dlP ~ of environment ( n , I ) . 
A/so , the pivot nodes 4 for the insmune at nd object p ~ ferences of plough ( v , i ) ~ b ~ henvironment(n , l ) , thereby indicating an even monge relationship between the insmmaent and the object of the senwnce  . Thus , an analogy exists between ploughings oil and sailing water  ;  , suggesting a new sense of plough that combines aspects of beth  . 
Denised rank the bottle.
denise(n , 1)-anc->woman(n , 1-prop->\[sex(n , i ) , \[female ( aj#I ) \]\]-link -> female ( aJ , i ) - obj -> animal(n , I ) <- agent-drink(v , i ) - obj->drink(n#1-ant->liquid(n , 1) <- link ~ lit(n ,  1 ) , contain ( v , I ) , liquid(n , I )\] <- prop-bottle(n ,   1 A metonymic path is indicated when a path is found from a target sense through one of its inherited differentia e  ; thus linking the original sense to a related sense through a property or preference rela  . 
tionship . For example in the sen~nceDenised rank the bottle  , one of the properties of bottle(n , 1) is\[it(n ,  1) , contain ( v ,  1) , liquid(n ,  1) 1 . 
This differe ali allows us to derive a novel metonymic word sense for bottle in which the bottle's conwmts are denoted rather than the boule itself  . 
Undermem Uel , any different ia can act as a conduit for a memnymy  ; thus facilitating the generation of novel metonymies a well as novel word senses  . 
By using semantic network path schemata to identify instances of nonliteral usage  , we have expanded the power of our program without doing so at the expense of a larger lexicon  . In addition , by keeping our semantic relationship and path schema criteria at a general evel  , we hope to be able to cover a wide variety of different semantic taxo-nomies  .
