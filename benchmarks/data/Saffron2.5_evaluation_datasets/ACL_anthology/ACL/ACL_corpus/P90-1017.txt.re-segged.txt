Though most translation systems have some mechanism for translating certain types of divergent predicate-argument structures  , they do not provide a genera \] procedure that takes advantage of the relationship between lexical-semantic structure and syntactic structure  . A divergent predicate-argument structure is one in which the predicate  ( e . g . , the main verb ) or its arguments ( e . g . , the subject and object ) do not have the same syntactic ordering properties for both the source and target language  . To account for such ordering differences , a machine translator must consider language -specific syntactic idiosyncrasies that distinguish a target language ? roma source language  , while making use of lexical-semantic uniformities that tie the two languages together  . This paper describes the mechanisms used by the UNITRAN machine translation system for mapping an underlying lexical-conceptual structure to a syntactic structure  ( and vice ? erea )  , and it shows how these mechanisms coupled with a set of general linking routine solve the problem of thematic divergence in machine translation  . 
1 INTRODUCTION
There are a number of different divergence types that arise during the translation of a source language to a target language  . Figure 1 shows some of these divergences with respect o Spanish  , English , and German .   1 We will look at each of these traditionally diflic nlt divergence types in turn  . The first divergence type is a structural divergence in that the verbal object is realized as a noun phrase  ( John ) in English and as a prepositional phrase ( a Juan ) in Spanish . The second diver , * This paper describes research done at the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology  .

Figure 1: Divergence Types in Machine Translation gence is conttational  . Conflation is the incorporation of necessary participants  ( or arguments ) of a given action . 
Here , English uses the single word like for the two German words haben  ( have ) and gem ( likingly )  ; this is because the manner argument ( i . e . , the likingly portion of the lexical token ) is incorporated into the main verb in English . The third divergence type is alcxical divergence as illustrated in the stabexample by the choice of a different lexical word dar  ( literally give ) for the words tab . The fourth divergence type is categoria \] in that the predicate is adjectival  ( hungry ) in English but nominal ( hunger ) in German . Finally , the fifth divergence type is a thematic divergence : the object  ( Mary ) of the English sentence is translated as the subject  ( Maria ) in the
Spanish sentence.
The final divergence type , thematic divergence , is the one that will be the focus of this paper . We will look at thematic divergence problem by mapping an underlying lexical-conceptual structure to a syntactic structure  ( and vice versa ) on the basis of a set of general linking routines and their associated mechanisms  . The other divergences are also handled by the UNITRAN system  , but these are discussed in \[ Doff ,  1990\] . 
It turns out the reate two types of thematic divergences that show up in the translation of a source language to a target language : the first type consists of a reordering of arguments for a given predicate  ; and the second type consists of a reordering of predicates with respect otheir arguments or modifiers  . We will look at examples of each of these types in turn  . 
In the first case , an example is the reversal of the subject with an object as in the EnglishSpanish example of gustar -like shown in figure  1  . The predicate-argument structures axe shown here :   2  \[ , -MAxIN-MAX Maria \]\[ V-MAX\[ V-1 \[ V-MIN megusts\]\[P-MAX armq\]\]\] ( 1 ) \[I-MAXIN-MAX 1\] \[V-MAX\[`'I\[`"M~Nme\]\[N~AXMary\]\] \]\] Here the subject Marls has reversed places with the object mr  . The result is that the object miturns into the subject I  , and the subject Marlsturns into the object Mary . The reverse would be true if translation went in the opposite direction  . 
An example of the second case of thematic divergence  ( not shown in figure 1 ) is the promotion of a complement up to the main verb  , and the demotion of the main verb into an adjunct position  ( or v/ceversa )  . By promotion , we mean placement " higher up " in the syntactic structure  , and by demotion , we mean placement " lower down " in the syntactic structure  . This situation arises in the translation of the Spanish sentence Juansuelei raeasa into the English sentence John usually goes home :  ( 2 ) \[X-MAX\[~-MAXJuan\]\[`'-MAX\[V-*\[V -Mmsuele\]\[  , ,- MAX ir \] b-MAX a casa \]\]\]\]\] \[ z-MAx \[ N -u  . x John \] Iv . MAX\[V . X\[v-iU Sually Iv . raNgoes\]\]
IN . MAX home\]\]\]\]
Here the main verb soler takes ir as a complement ; but , in English , their predicate has been placed into a higher position as the main verb go  , and soler is placed into a lower position as the adjunct usually associated with the main verb  . The reverse would be true if translation went in the opposite direction  . 
MOlt entimes a native speaker of Spanish will invert the subject opost verbal position :\[ I -MAXel IV-MAX\[  V-1 \[ V-Mmmegusta\]\[P-MAX aml\]\]\]
IN-MAX Maria \] i \].
However , this does not affect the internal/external reversal scheme described here since inversion takes place independently after thematic divergences have been handled  . 
Another example of the second case of thematic divergence is the demotion of the main verb into a complement position  , and the promotion of an adjunct up to the main verb  ( or vice versa )  . This situation arises in the translation of the German sentence I chessegem into the English sentence I like eating :\[ I  . MAXIN-MAXIch\]IV-MAXIV-!\[V-S\[V-MTN esse\]gem\]\]\]\]  ( 3 ) \[X-M~xC~-MAx ~\[\]\[ , '- MAX\[V . ~\[`'-~~ e\]\[V-M ~ X eating \]\]\]\] Here the main verb essent a kesgem as an adjunct  ; but , in English , gem has been placed into a higher position as the main verb like  , and the essen predicate has been placed into a lower position as the complementeating of the main verb  . The reverse would be true if translation went in the opposite direction  , a This paper will show how the system uses three mechanisms along with a set of genera linking routines  ( to be defined ) to solve thematic divergences such as those that have been presented  . The next section introduces the terminology and mechanisms that are used in the solution of these divergences  , and , in so doing , it will provide a briefg limpse of how thematic divergences are tackled  . Section 3 discusses other approaches ( and their shortcomings ) in light of the thematic divergence problem . Finally , section 4 presents a general solution for the problem of thematic divergences  , howing in more detail how a set of genera linking routines and their associated mechanisms provide the appropriate mapping from source to target language  . 
2 TER MINOL OGY AND

Before we examine thematic divergences and how they are solved  , we must first look at the terminology and mechanisms used throughout this paper :  4 sit might be argued that a " direct " translation is possible for each of these three examples :  ( It ) Mary pleases me ( 21 ) John is accustomed to going home ( 3 , ) I eat -~" ins\]y The problem with taking a direct approach is that it is not general enough to handle a wide range of cases  . For example , gem can be used in conjunction with haben to mean like : Ichbabe Mariegem  ( ' I like Mary ' )  . The literal translation , I have Mary likingly , is not only stylistically unattractive , but it is not a valid translation for this sentence  . In addition , the direct-mapping approach is not bidirectional in the general case  . Thus , even if we did take (1 , ) ,  (2 , ) , and (3 , ) to be the translations for (1) ,  (2) , and (3) , we would not be able to apply the same direct mapping on the English sentences of  ( 1 )  ,  (2) , and ( 3 )   ( translating in the opposite direction ) because we would still need to translate like and usually into Spanish and German  . It is clear that we need some type of uniform method for translating thematic divergences  . 
4 The terms complement , specifier , and adjunct have not been defined ; roughly , these correspond to syntactic object , structure conforming to a modified version of Jack-end off's wellformedness rules\[ Jackendoff  ,  1983\] . 
For example , I like Mary is represented as : \[ State BEI deat ( \[Tsi~sREFERENT\] , \[ PlaceATI deat(\[~ka , m /: FERENT\] , \[ Th'- , PERSOI~\])\] ,  \ [  ,   .   .   .   .   . LIKINGLY\] ) \] The mapping that solves thematic divergences i defined in terms of the RLCS  , the CLCS , the syntactic structure , and the markers that specify internal/external and promotion/demotion information  . These markers , or mechanisms , are specified as follows : MechAnism 1: The : INT and : EXT markers are override position markers that determine where the internal and external arguments will be positioned for a given lexical root word  . 
Definition 2: An RLCS is an uninstantiated LCS that is associated with a root word definition in the lexicon  ( i . e . , an LCS with unfilled variable positions ) . For example , an RLCS associated with the word like is : \[ Sta  *  , BEId , ~ , (\[ Thla , X \] , \[ Place ATI do a , (\[ Thing X\] , \[ Thing"Y\])\] , \[ M .   .   .   .   . LIKINGLY\] ) \] Definition 3: ACLCS is a composed ( instantiated ) LCS that is the result of combining two or more RLCS's by means of unification  ( roughly )  . This is the interlingua or language-independent form that is the pivot between the source and target language  . For example if we compose the RLCS for like with the RLCS's for I  ( \[~ hi . sREFERENT\]) and Mary (\[ Thing PERSON\]) , we get the CLCS corresponding to 2" like Mary ( as shown in definition 1 )  . 
Definition 4: An Internal Argument Position is a syntactic omplement for a lexical word of category V  , N , A , P , I , or C . s Definition 5: An Ezternal Argument Position is a syntactic specifier of N for a lexical word of category N or a specifier of I for a lexical word of category V  . 
Definition 6: An Adjunct Argument Position is a syntactic modifier that is neither internal nor external with respect o a lexieal word  . 
Each word entry in the lexicon is associated with an RLCS  , whose variable positions may have certain restrictions on them such as internai/externalnd pro-motion/demotion iformation  ( to be described )  . The CLCS is the structure that results from combining the lexieal ~ items of a source -languages ntence into a single underlying pivot form  . 
subject , and modifier , respectively . For a more detaile de-scription of these and some of the other definitions here  , see\[Dorr ,  1990\] . 
sv , N , A , P , I , and C stand for Verb , Noun , Adjective , Preposition , Inflection , and Complementiser , respectively . 
For example , the lexical entry for gust ar is an RLCS that looks like the RLCS for like  ( see definition 2 ) except hatit includes the : INT and : EXTma ~ kers:\[StateBEldent  ( \[T ~ imsX:mT\] , \[ Place ATId . m , (\[ Thi-sX\] , \[TS iffigY:EXT\])\] , \[ma . ae , LIKINGLY\] ) \] During the mapping from the CLCS ( shown in definition 1 ) to the syntactic structure , the RLCS forgustar ( or like ) is matched agains the CLCS , and the arguments are positioned according to the specification associated with the RLCS  . sThus , the : INT and : EXT markers account for the syntactic distinction between Spanish and English by realizing the\[ThingREFERENT\]node of the CLCS  ( corresponding to X in the RLCS ) as the internal argument ml in Spanish , but as the external argument I in English ; and also by realizing the \[ T~i , s PERSON \] node of the CLCS ( corresponding to Y in the RLCS ) as the external argument Maria in Spanish , but as the internal argument Mary in English . Note that the : INT and : EXT markers show up only in the ILLCS  . The CLCS does not include any such markers as it is intended to be a language-independent representation for the source - and target -languages ntence  . 
Mechanism 2: The : PROMOTE marker associated with an RLCS 7f places a restriction on the complement 7~1 of the head 7~t   .   7 This restriction forces 7~1 to be promoted in the CLCS as the head 7  ~ .   7~ is then dropped into a modifier position of the CLCS  , and the logical subject of 7 ~ is inherited from the CLCS associated with the syntactic subject of ?/ I  . sFor example , the lexical entry for soler contains a:PROMOTE marker that is associated with the RLCS : \[~  .   .   .   .   . HABITUALLY : PROMOTE\]Thus , in the above formula 7"/! corresponds to soler , and 7~1 corresponds to the complement of soler . The : PROMOTE marker forces the syntactic complement  7~! to be promoted into head ST helexlced-selection procedure that maps the CLCS to the appropriate RLCS  ( for like orgustar ) is not described in detail here ( see\[Dorr ,  1990\]) . Roughly , lexical selection is a 129 unification-like process that matches the CLCS to the RLCS templates in the lexicon  , and chooses the associated lexical words accordingly  . 
position as 7) in the CLCS , and the head 7/I to be demoted into modifier position as 7/in the CLCS . 
So , in example (2) of the last section , the resulting
CLCS is : 9\[ , ,? n , GOLo , (\[ Thing PERSON\] , \[ P . , hTOLo ~(\[ mac . ATLo . (\[ Thi . gPERSON\],\[p , . ? . HOME\])\])\],\[M .   .   .   .   . HABITUALLY \])\] Here the RLCS for sole r,\[M .   .   .   .   . HABITUALLY\] , corresponds to 7" l and the RLCS for it , \[ B , ? ~ tGO . . . \], corresponds to : P . In the translation to English , \[~ .   .   .   .   . HABITUALLY \] is not promoted , so it is realized as an adjunct usually of the main verb go  . 
Mechanism 3: The : DEMOTE marker associated with an RLCS 7 ~ places a restriction on the head 7~1 of the adjunct : Pt . This restriction forces 7~ to be demoted into an argument position of the CLCS  , and the logical subject of ~ to be inherited from the logical subject of  7"l  . 
For example , the lexical entry for gem contains a : DEMOTE marker that is associated with the Y argument in the RLCS : \[ stAte BE cl  , c(\[Thi . , x \] , \[mac ? ATm , ~(\[ Thins X\] ,  \[~ , ,= , Y : DEMOTE\])\] , \[ M .   .   .   .   . LIKING LY \])\] Thus , in the above formula , T ~ t corresponds to gemand 7~! corresponds to the syntactic head that takes gem as an adjunct  . The : DEMOTE marker forces the head 7~ I to be demoted into an argument position as 7~ in the CLCS , and the adjunct 7~1 to be promoted into head position as 7 ~ in the CLCS . So in example (3) of the last section , the resulting CLCS is : \[ s , * , , BEci , c(\[ThingREFERENT\] , \[ PIn ? , ATci , ?(\[T~i=gREFERENT\] ,  \[ , ,? n , EAT(\[Thi~sREFERENT\] , \[ ThingFOOD\])\])\] ,   .   .   .   .   . LIKINGLY \])\] 10 Here the RLCS for gem , \[ s , a , oBEci ~ .   .   .   .  \] , corresponds to : P and the RLCS for essen , \[ s , nt ? EAT . . . \], corresponds to 7" l . In the translation to English , \[st ** eBEc ~ .   .   .   . \] is not demoted , so it is realized as the main verb like that takes eating as its complement  . 
PIn general , a syntactic argumentul is the canonical syntactic realization  ( CS  ~ ) of the corresponding CLCS argument u . The CS7~ function is a modified version of a routine proposed in \[ Chomsky  ,  1986\] . See\[Dorr ,   1990\] for a more detaile discussion of this function . 
S The logical subject is the highest/left-most argument in the CLCS  .   130 Now that we have looked briefly at the mechanisms involved in solving thematic divergences in UNITRAN  , we will look at how other approaches have attempted to solve this problem  . 
3 PREVIOUS APPROACHES
In tackling the more global problem of machine translation  , many people have addresse different pieces of the thematic divergence problem  , but no single approach as yet attempted to solve the entire space of thematic divergence possibilities  . Furthermore , the pieces that have been solved are accounted for by mechanisms that are not general enough to carry over to other pieces of the problem  , nor do they take advantage of crosslinguistic uniformities that cantie seemingly different languages together  . 
Gretchen Brown has provided a model of German -English translation that uses lezical semantic structures \[ Brown  ,  1974\] . The work is related to the model developed for UNITRAN since both use a form of conceptual structure as the basis of translation  . While this approach goes a long way toward solving a number of translation problems  ( especially compound noun disamhiguation )  , it falls short of providing a systematic solution to the thematic divergence problem  . This is largely because the conceptual structure does not serve as a common representation for the source and target languages  . Instead , it is used as a point of transfer , and as such , it is forced to encode certain language-specific idiosyncrasie such as the syntactic positioning of conceptual arguments  . In terms of the representations used in UNITRAN , this approach is analogous to using a language-to -language mapping from the RLCS's of the source language to the RLCS's of the target language without using an intermediate language -independent structure as a pivot form  . Insit should be noted that promotion and demotion struc-truces are inverses of each other  . Thus , although this CLCS looks somewhat " English-like , " it is possible to represent the CLCS as something that looks somewhat " Spanish-like : "\ [ State Beclze  ( \[ Thing PERSON\] , \[ PlaceATcirc(\[ThingPI~RSOiN\] , \[ EventGOLoc(\[ThingPERSON\] , \[ Path TOLo ? ( \[ Place AT Loc ( \[ Thing PERSON\] , \[ PlaceHOME \])\])\])\] , \[ M .   .   .   .   . HABITUALLY \])\] In this case , we would need to use the : DEMOTE marker ( see mechanism 3 ) instead of the : PROMOTE marker , but this marker would be used in the RLCS associated with usually instead of the RLCS associated with soler  . The justification for using the " English-like " version for this example is that the \[ Manner HABITUALLY\]constituent is generally thought of as an aspcctual clement associated with a predicate  ( e . g . , in German , the sentence would be Ichgehege wJhn lich nach Hause  ( ' I gousually home ' ) ) ; this constituent cannot be used as a predicate in its own right  . Thus , the complicated " Spanish-like " predicate -argument structure is not a likely conceptual representation for constructions that use \[ Manner HABITUALLY\]  . 
1?The default object being eaten is \[ Thing FOOD \]  , although this is not syntactically realized in this example  . 
this approach , there is no single language-independent mechanism that links the conceptual representation to the syntactic structure  ; thus , it is necessary to hand code the rules of thematic divergence for English and German  , and all divergence generalizations are lost . 
In 1982 , Lytinen and Schank developed the MOP-TRANS Spanish-English system based on conceptual dependency networks\[Lytinen & Schank  ,  1982\] .   11 This approach is related to the UNITRAN model of translation in that it uses an interlingual representation as the pivot from source to target language  . The key distinction is that the approach lacks a generalized linking to syntax  . For example , there is no systematic method for determining which conceptual argument is the subject and which is the object  . This means that there is no uniform mechanism for handling divergences such as the subject-object reversal of example  ( 1 )  . 
The LMT system is a logic-based EnglishGerman machine translator based on a modular logical grammar\[McCord  ,  1989\] . McCord specifically addresses the problem of thematic divergence in translating the sentence Mirgef ~ llt der Waged  ( I like the car )  . However , the solution that he offers is to provide a " transfer entry " that interchanges the subject and object positions  . There are two problems with this approach . First it relies specifically on this object -initial ordering  , even though the sentence is arguably more preferable with a subject-initial ordering Der Wagenge f ~ lltmir  ; thus , the solution is dependent on syntactic ordering considerations  , and will not work in the general case . Second the approach does not attemptotie this particular type of thematic divergence to the rest of the space of thematic divergence possibilities  ; thus , it cannot uniformly translate a conceptually similar sentence Ich \] ahred as Wagengem  ( I like to drive the car )  . 
4 THEMATICDIVERGENCES
In section 1 , we introduced some examples of thematic divergences  , and in section 2 we described some of the mechanisms that are used to solve these divergences  . 
Now that we have looked at other machine translation approaches with respect othe thematic divergence problem  , we will look at the solution that is used in the
UNITRAN system.
Recall that there are two types of thematic divergences :  1  . Different argument positionings with respect to a given predicate  . 
2 . Different predicate positionings with respect to arguments or modifiers  . 
The first type covers the case of argument positions that diverge  ; it is accounted for by the : INT and : EXT markers  . The second type covers the case of predicate positions that diverge  ; it is accounted for by the : PROMOTE 11Several researchers have worked within this framework including Goldman  \[1974\]  , Schank & Abelson\[1977\] , and many others . 131 and : DEMOTE markers . Together , these two types of divergences account for the entire space of thematic divergences  , ince all participants must be one of these two ( either an argument , or a predicate , or both ) . 
In both cases of thematic divergence , it is assumed that there is a CLCS that is derived from a source-language RLCS that is isomorphic to the corresponding target-language RLCS  ( i . e . , the variables in the 2 RLCS's map to the same positions , though they may be labeled differently ) . Furthermore , it is assumed that thematic divergence arises only in eases where there is a logical subject  . 
ACLCS with logical subject w , nonsubject arguments Zl , z2 ,   .   .   . , z  ~ , .   .   . , z =, and modifiers nl , n2 .   .   .   . , nz .   .   .   .   . n , ~ will look like the structure shown in (4) , where the dominating head 7 ~ is a typed primitive ( e . g . , BE circ ): (4)\[7~w,zl,z2 .   .   .   . , zk , .   .   . , z  ~ , nl , n2, .   .   . , n , .   .   .   , n , ~\] In order to derive the syntactic structure from the CLCS  , we need a mapping or linking rule between the CLCS positions and the appropriate syntactic positions  . 
Roughly , this linking rule is stated as follows :
General Linking Routine G: ( a ) Map the logical subject othe external argument position  . 
( b ) Map the non-logical-subjects to internal argument positions  . 
(c ) Map modifiers to adjunct positions.
( d ) Map the dominating head to the phrasal head position  . 
G is used for the second half of translation ( i . e . , mapping to the target-language structure ) ; we also need an inverse routine that maps syntactic positions of the source-language structure to the CLCS positions : 
Inverse Linking Routine G-l : ( a ) Map the external argument to the logical subject position  . 
( b ) Map the internal arguments to non-logical-subject positions  . 
(c ) Mapadjuncts to modifier positions.
( d ) Map the phrasal head to the dominating head node . 
In terms of the representation shown in (4) , the and ~-1 mappings would be defined as shown in figure 2  . 12, 1s'14 Note that wl , zlt .   .   .   . , zM , . .  . , znt , and nll, .   .   . , nlt , .   .   .   , nm ! are the source-languager-alizations of the corresponding CLCS tokens w  , zl ,   . . ?, zk , . . ?, zn , and nl , .   .   . , nz , .   .   .   , n , ~; similarly , wit , zllI ,  ? ? ?  , z ~ tll ,  ? ? ?  , Znll , and dill ,   .   .   . , dill, .   .   .   , nmll are target-language realizations of the same CLCS tokens  . 
This assumes that there is only one external argument and zero or more internal arguments  .

We will then See how the general linking routines described here take the syntactic mechanisms into account in order to derive the appropriate result  . 
4.1 Divergent Argument Posltionings
In order to account for the thematic revcrsa3 that shows up in the gustar-l ~ e example of ( 1 )  , we must have a mechanism for mapping CLCS axgum cnts to different syntactic positions  . In terms of the CLCS , we need to allow the syntactic realization of the logical subject w and the syntactic realization of a non subject argument  ( say zk ) to switch places between the source and target language  . 
Figure 3 shows how this type of argument reversal is achieved  . The : INT and : EXT markets axe used in the RLCS specifications as override markers for the G and G-I routines : the : INT marker is used to map the  logi-ca3 subject of the CLCS to an internal syntactic position  ( and vice versa )  . Thus , steps ( a ) and ( b ) of ~ and g-z are activated differently if the RLCS associated with the phrasal head contains either of the : INT or : EXT over ride mechanisms  . Note that the CLCS is the same for 12The convention adopted in this paper is to use ul for the source-language realization  , and url for the target-language realization for a CLCS argument u  . 
1 3Adjunction has been placed to the right at the maximal level  . However , this is not the general case . A parameter setting determines the side and level at which a particular adjunct will occur  ( as discussed in \[ Doff ,  1990\]) . The configuration shown corresponds to the spec -initial/head-initial case  . The other three possible configurations are :\[ Y-MA ~ ~' Ix-  ,  ~' ~' . . . ~'\[ XM~~"\]\]m' . . . . . ~,'\],\[Y-MAXIX-1\[X-MINPI\]Zl!g2f .   .   .   .

Finally , the order of the zit's and nfl's is not being addressed here  ; this is determined by independent principles also discussed in \[ Dorr  ,  1990~ . Regardless of these syntactic variations , the ~ and ~- routines operate uniformly because they are language-independent  . For simplicity , the spec-inlt lal/head-initial configuration will be used for the rest of this paper  . 
X ~ In addition to realization of arguments , the dominating CLCS head ( ~ P ) must also be realized as a lexical word ( PI in the SOVL rce language and ~ P , in the target language ) . The syntactic a tegory of this lexical word is X , and the maximal projection is Y-MAX . In general , Y = X unless X is a Verb ( in which case , Y is the Inflection category ) .  132

Now using the ~ and ~-1 routines and the overriding : INT and : EXT mechanisms  , we can show how to account for the thematic divergence of example  ( 1 )  . 
Figure 4 shows the mapping from Spanish to English for example  ( 1 )  . is ' Is Because the Spanish RLCS includes the : INT and : EXT markers  , the G-z routine activates steps ( a ) and ( b ) differently : the external argument Marfa is mapped to a non-logical-subject position \[ Thins PERSON\]  , and the internal argument ml is mapped to the logical subject position \[ Thi  , gREFERENT\] . BylS Because of space limitations , we will illustrate the three examples ( I ) ,  (2) , and (3) in one direction only . However , it should be clear that the thematic dlvergcnces are solved going in the opposite direction as well since the g and  g-1 mappings are reversible . 
1 8A shorthand notation is being used for the RLCS's and the CLCS  . See section 2 for a description of the actual representations used by the system  . 
contrast , the English RLCS does not include any special markers  . Thus , the Groutine activate steps ( a ) and ( b ) normally : the logical subject \[ Thi . gREFERENT\]is mapped to the external argument I  , and the non-logical-subject \[ Thl , s PERSON \] is mapped to the internal position Mary  . 
Now we have seen how argument positioning divergences are solved during the translation process J ? In the next section  , we will look at how we account for the second part of thematic divergences : different predicate positionings  . 
4 . 2 D ivergent P red icate Pos i t ion ings In the last section  , we concentrated primarily on thematic interchange of arguments  . In this section , we will concentrate on thematic interchange of predicates  . In so doing , we will have accounted for the entire space of thematic divergences  . 
There are two ways to be in a predicate-argument relationship : the first is by complementation  , and the second is by adjunction . That is , syntactic phrases include base-generated complements and base-generated adjuncts  , both of which participate in a predicate-argument structure  ( where the predicate is the head that subcategori ~ . es for the base-generated complement or adjunct ) , ts In order to show how predicate divergences are solved  , we must enumerate all possible source-language /target-language prdicate positionings with respect to arguments z ~  , z2 ,   .   .   . , zk , .   .   . , z , + and modifiers nt,n ~, .   .   . , nz , .   .   . , n  ~ . In terms of the syntactic structure , we must examine all the possible positionings for syntactic head  7~t with respect to its complements zzt , z~t ,   .   .   . , zht, .   .   . , znt and adjuncts rill , n2I, .   .   . , nil , .   .   . , nr nl . 
x r It should be noted that the solution presented here  ( as well as that of the next section ) does not appeal to an already-coded set of conceptual " frames  . " Rather , the syntactic structures are derived procedurally on the basis of two pieces of information : lexical entries  ( i . e . , the RLCS's ) and the result of composing the RLCS's into a single unit  ( i . e . , the CLCS) . It would not be possible to map declarative lp , i . e . , from a set of static source-language frames to a set of static target-language frames  . This is because the ~ and ~-1 routines are intended to operate recursively : an argument that occurs in a divergent phrasal construction might itself be a divergent phrasal construction  . For example , in the sentence lesae legustar leer a Jnan ( ' John usually likes to read ' )  , there is a simultaneous occurrence of two types of divergences : the verb solerexhibits a predicate positioning divergence with respect o its complement gustarleera Juan  , which itself exhibits an argument positioning divergence  . The procedural mappings described here are crucial for handling such cases  . 
iS We have left out the possibility of a base -generated specifier as a participant in the predicate-argument relationship  . 
Of course , the specifier is an argument to the predicate , but it turns out that the syntactic specifier , which corresponds to the logical subject in the LCS  , has a special status , and does not participate in predicate divergences in the same way as syntactic omplements and adjuncts  . This will be illustrated shortly .  133

There are a large number of possible positionings that exhibit predicate divergences  , but only two of them arise in natural language J 9 It turns out that the soler-usually example of ( 2 ) and the gem-like example of ( 3 ) are representative of the space of possibilities of predicate divergences  . The source-language/target-language predicate positionings for these two cases are represented as shown in figure  5  . Part ( a ) of this figure accounts for the translation of usually to soler  ( or vice versa )  , and part ( b ) accounts for the translation of like to gem ( or vice versa )  . 
The ~ and ~-1 routines do not take into accoun the predicate divergences that were just presented  . As in the case of argument divergences , predicate divergences require over ride markers . The : PROMOTE marker is used to map a modifier of the CLCS to a syntactic head position  ( and vice versa )  . The : DEMOTE marker is used to map a nonsubject argument of the CLCS to a syntactic head position  ( and vice versa )  . Thus , steps ( c ) , and 19 There is not enough space to elaborate on this claim here  . 
See\[Doff ,   1990\] for a detaile discussion of what the possible positionings are  , and which ones make sense in the context of linguistic structure  .

Now using the ~ and G-troutines and the overriding : PROMOTE and : DEMOTE mechanisms  , we can show how to account for the thematic divergences of examples  ( 2 ) and ( 3 )   ( see figures 6 and 7 , respectively ) . 
In figure 6 , the Spanish RLCS for soler includes the : PROMOTE marker  . Thus , steps ( c ) and ( d ) off -1 are overridden : the internal argumentira casa is promoted into the dominating head position \[ B  , o , , GOt . el ; and the phrasal heads uele is mapped into a modifier position \[ M  .   .   .   .   .

In figure 7 , the German RLCS forgem includes the : DEMOTE marker  ( associated with the variable Y )  .

5 SUMMARY
This paper has presented a solution to the problem of thematic divergences in machine translation  . The solution has been implemented in UNITRAN , a bidirectional system currently operating on Spanish  , English , and German , running in Common lisp on a Symbolics 3600 series machine . We have seen that the procedures involved are general enough to operate uniformly across different languages and divergence types  . Furthermore , the entire space of thematic divergence possibilities is covered in this approach without recourse to language-specific routines or transferules  . In addition to thematic divergences , the system handles the other divergence types shown in figure  1  , and it is expected that additional divergence types will be handled by means of equally principled methods  .
