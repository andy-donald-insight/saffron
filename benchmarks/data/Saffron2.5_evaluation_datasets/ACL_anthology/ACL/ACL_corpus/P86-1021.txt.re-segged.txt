We propose a mapping between prosodic phenomen and semantico-pragmatic effects based upon the hypothesis that intonation conveys information about the intentional as well as the attentional structure of discourse  . In particular , we discuss how variations in pitch range and choice of accent and tune can help to convey such information as : discourse segmentation and topic structure  , appropriate choice of referent , the distinction between ' given ' and ' new ' information  , conceptual contrast or parallelism between mentioned items  , and subordination relationships between propositions salient in the discourse  . Our goals for this research are practical as well as theoretical  . In particular , we are investigating the problem of intonational ssignment in synthetic speech  . 
1. Introduction
The role of prosody in discourse has been generally ack-nowledged but little understood  . Linguistic pragmaticists have noted that types of information status  ( such as glven/new , top lc/comment , focus/presupposition ) can be intonationally ' marked'\[1 , 2 , 3 , 4\] , that reference resolution may depend critically on intonation  \[5  ,  6\] , that intonation can be used to disambiguate among potentially ambiguous utterances  \[7  , 8\] , and that indirect speech acts may be signalled by intonational means  \[9  , 10 , 11\] . Conversational analysis of naturally occurring data has found that speakers may signal topic shift  , digression , and interruption , as well as turn-taking , intonationally\[12 ,  13 ,  141  . And the fact that intonational contours contribute in some way to utterance interpretation is itself unexception-able  \[8\]  . To date , however , identification of the prosodic phenomena involved -- and the proper mapping between thcse phenomena nd their semantico-pragmatic effects -- has been largely intuitive  , and the intonational phenomena involved have not been precisely described  . 
Here , we describe how certain of the resources of the intonational system are employed in discourse  . In particular , we discuss how speakers ' choice of pitch range  , accent , and tune contribute to the intentional and at tentlonal structuring of discourse -- the way speakers communicate the relationships among their discourse goals and the relative salience of entities  , attributes , and relationships mentioned in the discourse ) Our findings emerge from an intensive study of a simple example of speech synthesis : the script of a computer-aided instruction system  , TNT(Tutor'n'Trainer)\[16\] , which employs synthetic speech to tutor computer novices in the text editor vi  . Using the Text to Speech system ( TTS)i17\] , we have been able , by systematic variation of pitch 1 . Grosz and Sidaer \[15\] propose a tripartite view of discourse structure : all ngn lst lc structure  , which is the text/speech itself ; an attent lonal structure , including information about he relative salience of objects  , properties , relations , and intentions at a given point in the discourse ; and an Intentional structure , which relates dlscourse segment purposes ( those purposes whose recognition is essential to a segment achieving its intended effect  ) to one another . 
range and by a principled choice of accent and tune  , to highlight the structure of the tutorial text and thus to enhance its coherence  . 
While most studies of how intonation is used in discourse  , have been based solely on examination of intonational contours found in a natural corpus  , we have found that intonation synthesis provides a unique opportunity to manipulate the dimensions of variation orthogonally  . Thus we can pinpoint factors crucial for a given effect and evaluate various patterns for a given utterance and context  . 
2. The Domain
TNT was designed to teach computer-naive subjects vi  , a simple UNIX screen-oriented text editor . The tutorial portion provides a brief introduction to word processing  , to general features of vi , and to the tutor's help facilities ; the tutor then guides subjects through a series of learning tasks of graduate difficulty  . While the overall task structure is implicit in the tutorial text  , the subject can influence the course of the interaction via his/her manipulation of a set of ' helper ' keys  ; these keys provide hints ( HINT ) and reminders ( REMIND ) as well as the option of starting a task over again  ( DOOVER ) or suspending the tutorial temporarily ( HOLD )  . 
The fact that TNT is explicitly task-oriented , 2 makes it a good test bed for our purposes . An appropriate segmentation of the text , and a notion of the purpose of each segment and the hierarchical relationships among segments  , can be independently determined from the task at hand  . Also , certain characteristics of the text presented a particularly interesting challenge for our study  . First , the script contains little pronominal reference and very few socalled clue words-words and phrases such as now  , next , returning to , but , and on the other hand , which can identify discourse segment boundaries and relationships among segments  , signal interruptions and digressions , and so on\[19 , 20\] . Both of these phenomena ( together with intonation ) have been identified as important strategies for communicating discourse structure  \[15  , 18 , 19\] . Their virtual absence from the text presents a convenient opportunity for testing the power of intonation to structure a discourse  . Second , while we were not able to isolate points in the text where subjects had special difficulties  , we did informally observe certain general problems with turn-taking  3 in the tutor--specifically , it was not always clear when the tutor's turn was over-which we addressed in our synthesis of the text  . 
3. FOS ynthesis
To synthesize the fundamental frequency ( f0 ) contours for the TNT script , we used the intonation synthesis program 2 . That is , the tutorial is organized around a series of data processing tasks  , which the subject is guided through . See \[18\] for discussion of the characteristics of task -oriented domain discourse  .

The dimensions we will discuss here are phras ing  , pitch range , accent location , and tune . We illustrate each in our synthesis of the introduction to TNT : i  . Hello .

Figure 1. The TNT Introduction
In Figure 1 and in all figures below , ' T ' indicates the top of the pitch range in Hz , ' F ' indicates amount of compression of the pitch range at the end of declarative phrases  , ' H ' and ' L ' indicate high and low tones , '*' indicates at one's alignment with a stressed syll-able  , and '%' indicates a phrase boundary tone . We discuss these phenomena and our notational system in more detail below  . 
3.1 Phrasing
The first dimension of variation , phrasing , may be indicated by a pause , by a lengthening of the phrase-final syllable , and by the occurrence " of extrame lodic elements on the end of the phrase  . Variation in phrasing is illustrated in Figures 2 and 3  . 4In Figure 2 , line 8 is produced as a single phrase , whereas in Figure 3 , 
And is set off as a separate phrase.
One consequence of this strategy is that And becomes more prom-inent in the second version  . Phrasing variation will not be of central concern here  . Because of the syntactic simplicity of TNT , there were only a few cases where the phrasing could be varied in interesting ways  .

Thus , the highest points in the contour become higher and other aspects are propor-tionately affected  . Figure 4 shows an f0 contour for line 1 in the scriot above in the default pitch range used by TTS  .

Figure 5. Actual Pitch Range
The shape of the actual contour is the same as in Figure  4 but its scaling is different . Changes in pitch range appear to reflect the overall structure of the discourse  , with major topic shifts marked by marked increases in pitch range  . 
In addition to variations in overall pitch range , the intonation system exploits a local time -dependent type of pitch range variation  , called final lowering . In the experiments reported in \[24\] , it was found that the pitch range in declaratives i lowered and compressed in  . anticipation of the end of the utterance . Final lowering begins about half a second before the end and gradually increases  , reaching its greatest strength right at the end of the utterance  . This phenomenon appears to reflect the degree of ' final-ity ' of an utterance  ; the more final lowering , the more the sense that an utterance ' completes ' a topic is conveyed  . Contrast Figures 6 and 7 .

Figure 7. Without Final Lowering
In the notational system employed here , T represents the top line , of a phrase -- the maximal value for the f0 contour in the phrase . F expresses the amount of final lowering in terms of the ratio of the lowered pitch range to the starting pitch range  . The default value assumed below for T is 115 Hz and for F is 0  . 87 . 
3.3 Accent
Pitch accents , which fall on the stressed syllable of lexical items  , mark those items as intonationally prominent . In line 16 , for example , right has no pitch accent . If right were to be especially emphasized , it would have an accent . (In our notation , the absence of a specified accent indicates that a word is not accented  ; where we wish to highlight this point , we will employ '-' to mark a deac-cented word . ) The contrasting outcomes are shown in Figures 8 and 9  .

Figure 9. Right Accented
In the first case , the last f0 peak occurs on work and there is a fall to a low pitch on right  , then arise at the end of the phrase . In the second case , the entire peak-fall-rise configuration occurs on the word right  . 
There are six types of pitch accent in English \[23\]  , two simple tones--high and low--and four complex ones  . The most frequently used accent , the simple hight one , comes out as a peak on the accented syllable ( as , on right in Figure 9 ) and will be represented below as H * . The ' H ' indicates a hight one , and the '*' that the tone is aligned with a stressed syllable  . In some cases , we have used a L*accent , which occurs much lower in the pitch range than H * and is phonetically realized as a local  f0 minimum . The accent on make in Figure 13 below is a L * . The other English accents have two tones . Figure 10 shows a version of the sentence in Figures 2 and 3 with a L+tt*accent substituted for both H * accents in the second phrase  .

Note that there are still peaks on the stressed syllables  , but now a striking valley occurs just before each peak  . 
In our synthesis of the TNT script , we have made extensive use of the type of accent ranscribed in  \[23\] as H*+L . This accent , like other bitonal accents , triggers a rule which compresses the pitch range on following material in the phrase  , a phenomenon known as downstep or catathesls . For example , a simple contrast between H*H* and H*+LH*+L is illustrated in Figures  11 and 12 in two versions of the tutorial command to hit the ' remind ' helper key--Hit remind  .

Figure 12. H*+LH*+LLL~o
We have made particular use of downstepped contour such as this--i  . e . , sequences of H*4-L tones--which we will term H*+L sequence in the discussion below  . ( See Section 4 . 3 . ) The way a speaker is structuring a text helps to determine where pitch accents will fall  , as a speaker indicates how referents of accented or deaccented items are related to other items in the utterance or in some larger context  . 
In addition to pitch accents , each intonational phrase has a phrase accent and a boundary tone  . These two extratones may be either L or H . The boundary tone ( indicated by ' ~ o ' ) falls exactly at the phrase boundary , while the phrase accent ( indicated by an unadorned Hor L ) spreads over the material between the last pitch accent and the boundary tone  . Each intonational phrase contains one or more pitch accents  , a phrase accent , and a boundary tone . 
3.4 Tune
A phrase's tuneor melody is defined by its particular sequence of pitch accents  , phrase accent , and boundary tone . 
Thus , H*LL ~ o represents a tune with a H * pitch accent  , aL phrase accent , and a L ~: ~ boundary tone . This is an ordinary declarative pattern with a final fall  . A interrogative contour is represented by L*HH ~ o  . The contrast between these two melo-dies is illustrated in Figures  13 and 14  . Figure 13 shows the actual f0 contour for line 5 of the TNT introduction , produced as a question .

Figure 14. Declarative Contour
With the declarative intonation characteristic of imperatives  ,   5 would probably convey that the hearer was being ordered to produce a typo  . Roughly speaking , the tune appears to convey information about speaker attitudes and intentions  ( as , the speech act the speaker intends to perform ) and about the relationship between utterances in a discourse  . 
139 4 . Intonational and Discourse Phenomena The major questions underlying our research are : First  , what is the relationship between particular '- , intonational phenomen and particular discourse phenomena ? ~ For example  , what discourse phenomen are associated with e h ? ~ iges in pitch range ? With the accenting or deaccenting of particular lexical items ? With choice of tune ? More generally  , we also characterize the contributions of these intonational phenomena in terms of the theory  . of , discourse structure developed in \[15\] , by relating intoua-tionM . contributions to aspects of intentional and attentional discourse structure  . Second , how do int0na~ionul feature such as these interact with one another ? Does an expansion of pitch range affect the interpretation of a rise-fall-rise contour  \[25\]  , for example , and if so how ? Third , when several discourse features predict conflicting intonational strategies  , how is a decision made ? When the information represented by a single referring expression  , for example , is both ' given ' and ' contrastive '-- and thus both deac-centable and accentable--how is the choice to be made ?  4  . 1 P i tch Range Man ipu la t ion Students of discourse commonly observe that discourses often exhibit a hierarchical structure-into major topics  , their subtopics , sub-subtopics , and so on . In task-oriente domains , it has been claimed that this structure reflects the hierarchical structure of a task and its subtasks  \[18\]  . So , for example , the TNT introduction above might be segmented as follows  ( where utterances are labeled by line number ) :5 Table 1 . Segmenting the TNT Introduction 0   3   4   6   7   9   10   11 This bracketing schema defines a discourse segment as any node together with all the nodes it dominates  ; for example , lines 111 form a segment , as do lines 1416 , and so on . An alternative depic-tion of the hierarchy above would be  \[0\[1/2   3   \[4   \[5   6   7\]   \[8   9   10   11\]\]\]   \[12   \[13\]   [14   15   16\]\]\]fi Evidence for such hierarchical segmentation in general is found in instances of pronominal reference to referents linearly distant in the discourse  ; in such cases , a notion of hierarchical proximity appears plausible  . 
Previous research \ [12 , 1 4\] has observed that ' topic jump ' can be signalled by raised pitch  , as well as increased a ~ plitude and markers of self-editing  , hesitation , and discontinuity - . and that pauses and changes in rate characterize segment boundaries  . In our work with the TNT script , we found that a hierarchical segmentation of discourse can be marked by systematic variation in pitch range  , which can signal movement betweeen levels in the segment hierarchy  . In addition , by varying the amount of final rais'ihgor lowering at the end of phrases  , we can indicate the degree of conceptual continuity between one phrase and the next  . We have developed algorithms for assigning pitch range and fiual raising/lowering in terms of the discourse segmentation  . 
5 . We do not claim this is the only possible segmentation  , ly that it is a plausible one to convey . 
6 . Note that I and 2 are treated as a unit here , although they are synthesized as separate phrases  , since it seemed semantically correct . 
To illustrate the algorithms , we relate the TNT introduction presented in Figure  1 to its segmentation i Table 1  . When the introduction is synthesized using the TTS'default pitch range of  75-11~ Hz , the top line for each utterance will remain around  115 Hz . However , the hierarchical relationship schematized above among the various segments may be signalled more clearly if the pitch range is varied  . In our version of the script , each segment boundary is marked by a variation in pitch range which correlates with the segment's position in the overall discourse  . So , major boundaries are denoted by the largest increases  , with smaller increases marking subsegment boundaries  , and so on . The segment beginning at 1 , for example , is marked by raising the f0 top line to 150 Hz ; that beginning at 14 , by raising the top line to 136 Hz ; and that beginning at 15 , by raising the top line to 125 Hz .   7 Human speakers do seem to employ a wider spectrum of pitch range variation than we have been able to use in synthesis  , however . 
We would claim that the appropriateness of changes in pitch range is a function of the segmentation hierarchy -- and is not inherent in the utterance in isolation  . Our algorithm for pitch range assignment can in fact enforce one segmentation of a given discourse over another and  , in so doing , can disambiguate among potentially ambiguous reference resolutions  . For example , It in line 7 of Figure 1 coindexes mistake , while it in line 8 coindexes word processing . A simple linear approach to reference resolution ( such as \[26\] ) would have the second coindexical with the previous noun phrase  ( np )  , mistake , but a hierarchical approach to discourse structure holds out the possibility that a referent in a segment dominating the current segment may also provide a referent  \[18\]  , as , in fact , is the case here . While a little thought will make the appropriate referent clear  , it is clearer when line 8 is produced with a larger pitch range to signal the beginning of a new subseg-ment of the segment headed by  4  . By so doing , we lessen the possibility that a referent for this it will be sought in lines  . :5-7 . .The most likely candidate , found in 4 , is now both intonationally and conceptually 8's superordinate discourse segment . 
While an increase in the pitch range indicates egment boundaries  , a decrease in the final lowering effects can indicate the absence of such boundaries  , and thus indicate that a given utterance and one which follows it are part of the same segment  . So , manipulation of final lowering can also serve to indicate discourse structure  , by identifying the internal structure of segments  . For example , at one point in the TNT script , the following utterance constitutes an entire discourse segment  , so it has , the default final lowering ( F = 0 . 87); in consequence , the L~tone at the end of had will be only 87% as high as it would have been if final lowering had not applied  . 
F.87 Type had.
H*H*LL ~
Compare this with:
Type had.
F.93 H*H*LL ~
When you're done,
H*LH ~ hit changer.
H*LL ~
Here , the same utterance is synthesized with less final lowering -- the L~tone at the end of had  , in particular , will attain 93% of its target height . In this segment , the first line does not end the segment . We further propose that the degree of final lowering may correlate with the utterance's position in the discourse hierarchy  . 
Specifically , we suggest hat minimal final lowering may indicate a ' push ' onto the segment stack and greater degrees of final lowering Our choice of ranges was determined in part by the TTS synthesizer  , which tends to sound best when it stopline ranges between  115-150 Hz . Preliminary investigation of pitch range changes in human speech indicates that  , formal espeakers , these choices are reasonable . Note also that it is the relationship among different range levels  , not the actual values in Hz , which is important here . 
140 may be associated with ' pops ' of this stack . In our synthesis of the TNT text , we have varied degree of final lowering for such ' pops'based upon the level of the segment which this utterance ' completes '  ( or , equivalently , the level of the segment the next utterance begins  )  . So , to determine the amount of final lowering to assign when synthesizing line  7 in the TNT introduction , we first determine whether it completes a segment  ( representing a pop ) or not ( representing a push )  . If the former , we may note either that it completes the segment begun at line  5   ( with a top line of 136 Hz )  , or that the subsequent segment is begun ( by line 8 ) with a top line of 136 Hz . We assign final lowering of 0 . 9 0 when synthesizing line 7 based on either observation ; this rather large amount ( close to the synthesizer's default maximum of 0 , 87 ) conveys a relatively important change of subtopic within the larger discourse segment by indicating rather more disjunction than we would want  , for example , between lines 9 and 10 . 
We are currently testing the associations between pitch range/final lowering variation and discourse structure proposed above in several ways : by pitch-tracking a large corpus of natural speech  ,   8 by recording and analyzing subjects reading structured texts  , and by asking subjects to perform tasks such as reference resolution from texts synthesized with varying pitch ranges  . 
4.2 Accent Placement
Accent placement , too , can convey information about the structure of a discourse  . Traditionally , it has been noted that stress , or accent , can convey information about the focus of an utterance  , about given or new information in the discourse , o about parallelism , or about contrastiveness . In more general terms , one might say that accent placement appears to be associated with Grosz and Sidner's  \[15\] attent lonal structure -- the salience of discoursentities  , properties , relations , and intentions at any point in the discourse . We have particularly noted that the decision to accent or de accent some item is sensitive to the position of that item in the discourse structure -that is  , just as salience is always determined relative to some particular context  , accent placement must be determined with respect to the segment in which the accentable item appears  . We take the position that it is the signaling of salience relative to the discourse segment that produces the secondary effects of given new distinction  , topic-hood or contras-tiveness , and the favoring of one reference resolution over another  . 
One of the more common observations about the role of accent placement and the structuring of discourse is that accent can mark some item in the discourse as in focus-i  . e . , as ' what is being talked about ' \[28 , 2 9 --particularly when syntactic or thematic information might predict otherwise  . For example , in the following instructions , erase is accented in line 2 to indicate that the action of ' erasing ' is the focus of the current ask  . 
1. Type hell o.
H*H*LL~2.Next,let'serase hello.
H*LH~H*H*-LL~3. Hithint.
H*H*LL ~
For similar reasons , we accent hell o in line 1 and deaccent it in line 2  . 
While focus considerations clearly influence accent placement  , determining accent placement solely on the basis of utterance-level focus  ( as proposed in Gussenhoven \[29 and Cull-From interviews collected by A . Kroch and G . Ward and from recordings made of a radi of in ancial advise program by J  . Hirschberg and M . Pollack . 
Prince \[271 notes that the ' given/new'distinction has been variously defined as predictable/unpredictable  , saient/not salient , shared/not shared knowledge , and proposes a more complex taxonomy of ' assumed familiarity ' classifying discours entities as new  , inferrable , or evoked ( either textually or situation-ally ) . This is closely related -- and often confused with -- the notion of utterance topic/focus  . 
cover and Rochemont\[30\]) is insufficient . Considerations such as the given/new distinction play an important role  . 
Speakers typically deaeeent given information and accent new information  , as when the ' new ' information typing is accented and the ' old ' word processing is not in line  3 below :
We lcome to word processing.
B*H*LL ~
That's using a computer to write letters
H*H*H*H*H*and reports.
H*LL ~
Word processing makes typing easy.
H*H*H*LL ~
Note that these items are marked as ' given ' and ' new ' within the current segment -- although they may have other status within the larger discourse  . Furthermore , items appear ' given ' or ' new ' not simply because of prior mention  ( or lack thereof ) in a context but via ' physical co-presence ' , where speaker , hearer , and referents are physically and openly present together  ; \[31\] shared world knowledge ; or conceptual proximity \[11 . For example , the tutor can treat mas given in the following text because the student has just  ( incorrectly ) typed mary ; the character ' m ' , the student , and the tutor , are thus physically copresent . 
Oops . capitalm.
H*LH~H*-LL ~
The new information is that ' m ' is to be capitalized  . Thus cap ~ al is accented . Similarly , in the introduction to the tutor presented in Figure  1  , we can deaccent m~take because it is a super -cQncept of the previously mentioned typo : 
Make a type ?
L*H*HH ~
No problem.
H*H*LL ~
Just backup , type over the mistake,
H*H*LH~H*H*LH ~ and it's gone.
H*LL ~
We also examine how pronominalization iteracts with accent placement  . Since the ability to pronominalize is itself a standard test of givenness  , prowords , like other given items , are commonly deae cented . If they are accented , the hearer may draw very different conclusions from an utterance  . The following utterance , for example , may well convey an instruction to type the word something or even are prim and for not typing anything yet : 
Let ' shegln by typing something.
H*H*H *
Since the TNT script employes little pronominalization  , we often used eaccenting to ' intonationally pronominalize ' repetitions of lexical items  . 
Accent can also signal that a discourse referent other than that which would be ' most likely ' without special accentuation should be sought  , as in:


We can't answer questions , if you are confused.
H*H*H*LH~H*LL ~
We have to le ~ the computer do all the teaching.
H*H*H*H*LLS
Here ( and in particular at line 1) , we is intended to refer to the humans supervising the testing of the tutor  , although these humans have not previously been mentioned in the script  . However , this reference might easily be interpreted as referring to the are commonly deaccented  , we accent this one to indicate that an ' unusual ' referent should be sought  , 10 So , both accent placement and manipulation of pitch range can be used to reorder the list of potential referents for a given referring expression  . 
FinMly , e on trastiveness or parallelism may also be commun -icated via accent  . For example , second is accented in 3 , although it is certainly given in this segment ( via mention of second draft in 1 ) :
I.Nneda second draft ?
L*L*L*HH~2.No problem.
H*H*LL~3 . Just change the first , and you ' vegot the second . 
H*H*LH~H*H*LL ~
Note that , while second may be ' given ' at the discourse segment level  , the decision to accent it is based on contrast within a smaller context  ,  3 . Furthermore , if this function of accent is ignored , contrastiveness may be inferred incorrectly . If we accent we in the last line of the tutorial introduction WE will help you out  , for example , the student would be entitled to infer that others will not be helpful  . 
We are currently developing Mgorithms for determining accent placement  , based upon the interaction of focus , given/new , parallelism , contrastiveness , and pronominal reference within segment and phrase  . 
4.3 Choice of Tune
It is now widely accepted that the overall melody a speaker employs in an utterance can communicate some semantic or pragmatic information  . However , since there are few particular tune types for which we can specify with any confidence just what the meaning might be  , it is difficult to generalize about whattype of information tunes in gener M can convey  . From those tunes whose ' meaning'seems fairly well understood--namely  , declarative , yesno question\[23\] , surprlse/redundancy\[10\] , contradiction contour \[33\] rise-fall-rlse \[25\]  , and continuation rise\[34 , 3 5\] contours -- we propose that tunes convey two sorts of information about discourse  . 
First , we believe that contours can convey proposit ional attltudes n the speaker wishes to associate with the propositional content of an utterance  . For example , the speaker may wish to convey that s/he knows x , or that s/he believes x , or that s/he is uncertain about x , or that s/he is ignorant of x . In the case of H*+L sequences , it appears that a speaker may convey his/her ( propositional ) attitudes about a hearer's ( propositional ) attitudes toward an utterances . This tune seems to indicate the speaker's belief that the speech acts/he is performing is superfluous  . For example , a speaker may employ it to convey that the propositional content of his/her utterance is already known or would be obvious to the hearer  ( who , of course , may or may not be attending to it ) . 
Note that the speaker may or may not believe that this information is known  , in order to wish to convey this meaning . Particularly in pedagogical texts , this contour seems appropriate to introduce straightforward material  , as in the following instruction to hit the remind key  .

However , an H*+L sequence is not appropriate in the following similar exchange :  I0  . The standard example of accentuation influencing pronominal referencer solution in this way is ' john hit Bill and then HE hit HIM  1321  .

In general , such contours do not seem felicitous when the utterance conveys information which the speaker believes will be unexpected for the hearer  . Here tune choice may reflect attentional as well as intentional aspects of the discourse structure  . 
Like the deaccenting of references to given items , tt*+L sequence contour seem to convey ' givenness ' at a more general level  . 
Second , we believe that tune can convey the speaker's commitment o some semantico-pragmatic structural relationship holding between the propositional content of utterances  ( as , that one ' completes ' another or is subordinate to another  )  . Many such relations have been proposed in textual analysis  \[36  , 37 , 15\] . In the phonological literature , continuation rise has been commonly associated with some sense of ' continuation ' or ' more to come '  \[34\]  . We have found , howe-rer , that this contour can be characterized more precisely as conveying a subordination relationship between the phrase uttered with continuation rise and other utterances in the discourse segment  . For example , if the second phrase of line 1 is uttered with continuation rise , then this utterance appears to be subordinated to  2  .

That is , 2' completes'I . Without continuation rise on 1 , all three utterances will appear to have equal status in th'e segfiaent  . Furth-er more , continuation rise is not felicitous in ~ . ll ~ on texts in which the simple sense that ' there is more to come ' clearly should be appropriate  ; for example , continuation rise over 3 -- at the end of the tutorial introduction -- seems quite odd  , even though more will clearly follow . 
In synthesizing the TNT script , we have employed only a small subset of possible English tunes  . Analysis of the ' meaning ' of additional tunes is part of our future research  . More generally , we must examine how structural relationships conveyed by tunes such as H*+L sequence are ~  . ssociated with those conveyed by pitch range . 
We have described certain mappings between intonational features and discourse phenomena  , associating pitch range variation with the identification of discourse segments and with their internal coherence  ; accent with types of information status such as topic  ( focus ) and the given/new distinction , with reference resolution and with contrastiveness  ; and tune choice with ~~ he , relationships among propositions in the discourse as well as w~l ~ b  . ,~ome propositional attitude the speaker wishes to associate with : those pro-positions  . It appears that pitch range and accent placement are most closely associated with a dise ours e's attentional structure  , while tune choice is more closely associated with its intentional structure  . However , clearly this picture is too simple . Sever M intonational features may be used together to create some discourse effect  ; moreover , in some cases two distinct intonational phenomena seem to produce discours effects that seem intuitively to be closely related  . And sometimes several discourse phenomena may indicate conflicting intonational strategies  . These problems are the subject of our future research  . 
5. Discussion
The central thesis of this work is that there are many ways in which intonation helps to structure discourse  . By understanding the mapping between intonational phenomena and discourse phenomena  , we can enhance both our ability to interpret what We have described three major intonational phenomena--pitch range  , accent , and tune--and some of the information they allow speakers to communicate about discourse  , demonstrating some links between discourse and intonational phenomen ~ which have not been noted in the literature and refining some notions which have  . We also identify major issues which future research on the relationship between discourse and intonation must address  , including a more precise mapping between discourse and intonational phenomena  , the interaction of intonational phenomena to produce particular discours effects  , and the way conflict between intonational strategies signaled by various aspects of the discourse may be resolved  . 
We are currently testing and refining our hypotheses by  1  ) pitch tracking recorded natural discourse to determine pitch range manipulation  , and 2 ) conducting pilot empirical studies of how principled manipulation of pitch range can affect reference resolution  . We are also examining in some detail the relationship between pronominalization ad deaccenting  , pursuan to the development of better accenting algorithms for synthetic speech  . Our ultimate goals are practical as well as theoretical  . Once we have determined how particular intonational phenomena are related to particular discourse phenomena  , the next step is to determine how these findings can be applied to natural language neration  . In particular , how much intonational structuring of generated text can be done automatically ? What sorts of information must be represented to supporthe assignment of rhetorically effective intonation ?
