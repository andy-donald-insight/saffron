Abstract
We describe a method for interpreting abstract fi at syntactic representations  , LFG fstructures , as underspecified semantic representations , here Underspecified Discourse Representation Structures  ( UDRSs )  . The method establishes a one-to-one correspondence between subsets of the LFG and 
UDRS formalisms . It provides a model theoretic interpretation and an inferential component which operates directly on underspecified representations for fstructures through the translation images of fstructures as UDRSs  . 
1 Introduction
Lexical Functional Grammar ( LFG ) fstructures ( Kaplan and Bresnan , 1982; Dalrympletal . , 1995a ) are attribute-value matrices representing high level syntactic information abstracting away from the particulars of surface realization such as word order or inflection while capturing underly in generaliza-tions  . Although fstructures are first and foremost syntactic representations they do encode some semantic information  , namely basic predicate argument structure in the semantic form value of the PRED attribute  . Previous approaches to providing semantic omponents for LFGs concentrated on providing schemas for relating  ( or translating ) fstructures ( in ) to sets of disambiguated semantic representations which are then interpreted model theoretically  ( Halvorsen , 1983; Halvorsen and Kaplan , 1988; Fenstad et al , 1987; Wedekind and Kaplan , 1993; Dalrympletal . , 1996) . More recently , ( Genabith and Crouch ,  1996 ) presented a method for providing a direct and underspecified interpretation of fstructures by interpreting them as quasi-logical forms  ( QLFs )   ( Alshawi and Crouch ,  1992) . The approach was prompted by striking structural similarities between f-structure\['PRED~COACH  ~\]

R )   ) both of which are fiat representations which allow underspecification fe  . g . the scope of quantificational NPs . In this companion paper we show that fstructures are just as easily interpretable as UDRSs  ( Reyle , 1993; Reyle , 1995): coach(x ) layer(y)

We do this in terms of a translation function r from fstructures to UDRSs  . The recursive part of the definition states that the translation of an f-structure is simply the union of the translation of its component parts :  '   F1   71   . . .

The details of the LFG and UDRT formalisms are described at lengthelse where : here we briefly present the very basics of the UDRS formalism  ; we define a language of wff-s ( wellformed fstructures )  ; we define a mapping 7" from fstructures to UDRSs together with a reverse mapping r  -1 and we show correctness with respectoan independent semantics  ( Dalrympl et al . , 1996) . Finally , unlike QLF the UDRS formalism comes equipped with an inference mechanism which operates directly on the underspecified representations without the need of considering cases  . 
We illustrate our approach with a simple example involving the UDRS deduction component  ( see also ( KSnig and Reyle ,  1996 ) where amongst other things the possibility of direct deductions on fstructures id is cussed  )  . 
2 Underspecified Discourse
Representation Structures
In standard DRT ( Kamp and Reyle ,  1993 ) scope relations between quantificational structures and operators are unambiguously specified in terms of the structure and nesting of boxes  . UDRT ( Reyle , 1993; Reyle ,  1995 ) allows partial specifications of scope relations . Textual definitions of UDRSs are based on a labeling  ( indexing ) of DRS conditions and a statement of a partial ordering relation between the labels  . The language of UDRSs is based on a set L of labels  , a set Ref of discourse referents and a set Rel of relation symbols  . It features two types of conditions : 11 .   ( a ) if/EL and xER efthen l:x is a condition ( b ) if 1EL , RERelan-place relation and Xl ,   .   . , XnER efthenl : P ( Xl, . . , Xn ) is a condition ( c ) if li , ljEL then li:'~lj is a condition ( d ) if li , lj , IkEL then li:lj : : ? , l ~ is a condition ( e ) if l , ll ,   .   .   . , lnEL then l:V(ll , .   .   . , ln ) is a condition 2 . if li , IjEL then li < lj is a condition where _< is a partial ordering defining an upper semilattice with a top element  . 
UDRSs are pairs of a set of type 2 conditions with a set of type 1 conditions : ? AUDRS/C is a pair ( L , C ) where L = ( i , < ) is an upper semilattice of labels and Caset of conditions of type  1 above such that if li : ~ ljE 1The definition abstracts away from some of the complexities in the full definitions of the UDRS language  ( Reyle ,  1993) . The full language also contains type 1 conditions of the form 1 : a ( ll ,   .   .   . , ln ) indicating that (/1, . . . , In ) are contributed by a single sentence tc . 
C then lj : < liE ? and if li:lj ~ lkEC then lj < li  , lk < liE ? . 2 The construction of UDRSs , in particular the specification of the partial ordering between labeled conditions in ?  , is constrained by a set of metalevel constraints ( principles )  . They ensure , e . g . , that verbs are subordinated with respect to their scope inducing arguments  , that scope sensitive elements obey the restrictions postulated by whatever syntactic theory is adopted  , that potential antecedents are scoped with respect otheir anaphoric potential etc  . Below we list the basic cases : ? Clause Boundedness : the scope of genuinely quantificational structures is clause bounded  . 
If l q and let are the labels associated with the quantificational structure and the containing clause  , respectively , then the constraint lq < let enforces clause boundedness  . 
? Scope of Indefinites : indefinites labeled li may take arbitrarily wide scope in the representation  . They cannot exceed the toplevel DRSIT , i . e . li < IT . 
? Proper Names : proper names , 7r , always end up in the top level DRS , IT . This is specified lexically by IT : r The semantics i defined in terms of disambiguations & It takes its cue from the definition of the consequence relation  ; in the most recent version ( Reyle , 1995) with correlate disambiguations8t
V 61(r ~ , DM ' ) resulting in a conjunctive interpretation of a goal UDRS  .   3 In contrast to other proof systems the UDRS proof systems  ( Reyle , 1993; Reyle , 1995; Kbnig and Reyle ,  1996 ) operate directly on underspecified representations avoiding  ( whenever possible ) the need to consider disambiguated cases .   4   3 A language of well-formed f-structures The language of wff-s  ( wellformed fstructures ) is defined below . The basic vocabulary consists of five disjoint sets : GFs  ( subcategorizable grammatical functions )  , GF , ~( non-subcategorizable grammatical functions ) , SF ( semantic forms) , ATR ( attributes ) and ATOM ( atomic values ) :  2This closes Z : under the subordination relations induced by complex conditions of the form -~ K and Ki = ~ 

3 8 is a no ~ eration mapping a into one of its disambiguations c ~  . The original semantics in ( Reyle ,  1993 ) took its cue from V ~ i3/ij ( F6i~v ~ 6j ) resulting in a disjunctive semantics .

The side condition in the second clause ensures that only identical substructures can have identical tags  . Tags are used to represent reentrancies and will often appear vacuously  . The definition captures fstructures that are complete  , coherent and consistent . 6  4 Anf-structure-UDRS return tripIn order to illustrate the basic idea we will first give a simplified graphical definition of the translation r from fstructures to UDRSs  . The full textual definitions are given in the appendix ? The  ( U ) DRT construction principles distinguish between genuinely SWhere-denote syntactic identity modulo permutation of attribute-value pairs  . 
6Proof : simple induction on the formation rules for wff-s using the definitions of completeness  , coherence and consistency ( Kaplan and Bresnan ,  1982) . Because of lack of space here we cannot consider non-subcategorizable grammatical functions  . For a treatment of those in a QLF-style interpretation see  ( Genabith and Crouch ,  1996) . The notions of substructure occurring in an . f-structure and dom ( ~ o ) can easily be spelled out formally . 
The definition given above uses textual representations of fstructures  . It can easily be recast in terms of hierarchical sets  , finite functions , directed graphs etc . 
quantificational NPs and indefinite NPs . 7 Accordingly we have

If the lexical map between argument positions in UDRS predicates and grammatical functions in LFG semantic forms is a function it can be shown that for all ~ E w f f - s : ~- l  ( r ( ~ ) ) = Proof is by induction on the complexity of ~ . This establishes a one-to-one correspondence between subsets of the UDRS and LFG formalism  . Note that 7"   -1 is a partial function on UDRS representations . 
The reason is that in addition to full underspecification UDRT allows partial underspecification fscope for which there is no correlate in the original LFG f-structure formalism  . 
5 Correctness of the Translation
A correctness criterion for the translation can be defined in terms of preservation of truth with respect to an independent semantics  . Here we show correctness with respect othe linear logic  ( a ) sbased LFG semantics of ( Dalrympl et al . , 1996 ) :\[ r ( ~ )  \ ] --- \ [~ ( ~ ) \] Correctness is with respect to ( sets of ) disambiguations and truthflulu = 6 ( r ( ~ ) ) -  ll ~ ( ~  )  ~ , l where 6 is the UDRS disambiguation and b'u the linear logic consequence relation  . Without going into details/f works by adding subordination constraints turning partial into total orders  . In the absence of scope constraints l ? for a UDRS with n quantificational structures Q  ( that is including indefinites ) this results in n ! scope readings , as required . Linear logic deductions F-u produce scopings in terms of the order SThe notation a  ( ~ a ) is in analogy with the LFG a-projection and here refers to the set of linear logic meaning constructors associated with  99  . 
9This is because the original semantics in ( Dalrymple et al , 1996) is neither underspecified nor dynamic . See e . g . ( Genabith and Crouch ,  1997 ) for a dynamic and underspecified version of a linear logic based semantics  . 
Z ? Here we need to drop the clause boundedness constraint  . 
in which premises are consumed in a proof . Again , in the absence of scope constraints this results in n ! scopings for n quantifiers Q  . Everything else being equal , this establishes correctness with respect to sets of disambiguations  . 
6 A Worked Example
We illustrate our approach in terms of a simple example inference  . The translations below are obtained with the full definitions in the appendix  . 
\[~ Every coach supported a player.
Smith is a coach.
Smith supported a player.
Premise ~ is ambiguous between an widescope and a narrow scope reading of the indefinite NP  . From\[-fl and\[\] we can conclude Ii \] which is not ambiguous  . 
Assume that the following ( simplified ) fstructures ! a\[~\] , ?\[\] and ~\[ i \] are associated with \[- fl  , \[\] and \[ if , respectively :\[\[ PREDtCOACH'\]suBJLsPEc EVERYj\[\]'SUPPORT  ( ~"\[' f\]JPREDSUBJ , TOBJ)'LTMLsPEc\[PRED'PLAYER'\]A\[~

M ) which turns out to be the translation image under r of the f-structure ~\[ i \] associated with the conclusion ~  . la Summarizing we have that indeed : r r ( lil ) which given that 7- is correct does come as too much of a surprise . The possibility of defining deduction rules directly on fstructures id is cussed in  ( KSnig and Reyle ,  1996) . 
lX Note that the conclusion UDRSK ; \[ Il can be " collapsed " into the fully specified DRS zy smith  ( z ) player ( y ) support ( x , y )   7 Conclusion and Further Work In the present paper we have interpreted fstructures as UDRSs and illustrated with a simple example how the deductive mechanisms of UDRT can be exploited in the interpretation  . ( KSnig and Reyle ,  1996 ) amongst other things further explores this issue and proposes direct deduction on LFG fstructures  . We have formulated a reverse translation from UDRSs backint of structures and established a one -to-one correspondence between subsets of the LFG and UDRT formalisms  . As it stands , however , the level off-structure representation does not express the full range of subordination constraints available in UDRT  . In this paper we have covered the most basic parts  , the easy bits . The method has to be extended to a more extensive fragment to prove  ( or disprove ) its mettle . The UDRT and QLF ( Genabith and Crouch ,  1996 ) interpretations of fstructures invite comparison of the two semantic formalisms  . Without being able to go into any great detail , QLF and UDRT both provide underspecified semantics for ambiguous representations A in terms of sets col  ,   .   .   .   , COn offully disambiguated representations COi which can be obtained from A  . For a simple core fragment ( disregarding dynamic effects , wrinkles of the UDRS and QLF disambiguation operations /  ) ~ and 79 q etc . ) everything else being equal , for a given sentence S with associated QLF and UDRS representations Aq and A ~  , respectively , we have that Dq(Aq ) = CO l ,  . . . , qCO~and " D~,(Au ) = CO?, . . . , CO , I and pairwise\[CO/q\]=\[\[COu\]for 1 < i < n and col 6  ~ ) q ( Aq ) and COl'e7 ) ~ ( A = )  . That is the QLF and UDRT semantics coincide with respect ot ruth conditions Of representations in corresponding sets of disambiguations  . This said , however , they differ with respect to the semantics assigned to the underspecified representations Aq and An  . \[\[ Aq ~ is defined in terms of a supervaluation construction over CO q  .   .   .   .   , COq ( Alshawi and Crouch ,  1992 ) resulting in the three-valued : \[ Aq\]= 1 iff for all co~E ~ ) q ( Aq )  , \[COq\]~ . 1\[Aq\]\]0 iff for no COlE:Dq(Aq) , \[COl\]= 1 \[ Aq\]=undefined otherwise The UDRT semantics i defined classically and takes its cue from the definition of the semantic on se-quence relation for UDRS  . In ( Reyle , 1995):+' A +') ( where IE e += COiE:D , ,(\]E )) which implies that a goal
UDRS is interpreted conjunctively :\[ A ~ , ~95 = 1 iff for all COuE 7:) ~ , ( A  ~ , ) , \[COr ~ 9s  =  1 \[ Au \] gs = 0 otherwise while the definition in ( Reyle ,  1993 ) :+' A results in a disjunctive interpretation :\ [   Au\]\]93  =  0 otherwise It is easy to see that the UDRS semantics\[o ~\]  95and \[\[ od\] 93 each cover the two oppositends of the QLF semantics\[\[%\]\]:[o=\]  95 covers definite truth while \[\[ Ou\] 93covers definite falsity . 
On a final note , the remarkable correspondence b-tween LFG f -structure and UDRT and QLF representations  ( the latter two arguably being the major recent underspecified semantic representation formalisms  ) provides further independent motivation for a level of representation similar to LFG f -structure which antedates its underspecified semantic cousins by more than a decade  . 
8 Appendix
We now define a translation r from fstructures to UDRSs  . The ( U ) DRT construction principles distinguish between genuinely quantificational NPs  , indefinite NPs and proper names . Accordingly we have ? ~(\[ pREDn(trl , .   .   . , tr ~)\[ i \]) := /-'" kr .  ~  . \[\] uYmo:n(N2, . . . , %\]) where x\[~\]iffFiESUBJ,OBJ, . . . 7 ~\] := l\[~\]oiffriECOMP,XCOMP*T . \[~(\[ SPECEVERY\]ffRrDnOm ) := :' m , Wmtm , /ml::-<l\[3\] , l~o~-lm2\[3"\] , [SPECA\]"r=t/PREDLHOJ\]\]\] ) :=: tmzzt in )   . T~\](\[PREDl-I0\]~):=tT:xm , tT:n(xm ) , lmo_<l ~ The first clause defines the recursive part of the translation function and states that the translation of an f-structure is simply the union of the translations of its component parts  . The base cases of the definition are provided by the three remaining clauses  . They correspondirectly to the construction principles discussed in section  2  . The first one deals with genuinely quantificational NPs  , the second one with indefinites and the third one with proper names  . Note that the definitions ensure clause boundedness of quantificational NPsl\[/\]<l \[\]    , allow indefinites to take arbitrary wide scope 1\[\]\] <_h - and assign proper names to the top level of the resulting UDRS iv : z ~  , /v : H(zffj ) as required . The indices are our bookkeeping devices for label and variable management  . F-structure reentrancies are handled correctly without further stipulation  . Atomic attribute-value pairs can be included as unary definite relations  . 
For the reverse mapping assume a consistent UDRS labeling  ( e . g . as provided by the v mapping ) and a lexically specified mapping between subcategoriz-able grammatical functions in LFG semantic form and argument positions in the corresponding UDRT predicates :

The scaffolding which allows us to ire ) construct af-structure from a UDRS is provided by UDRS subordination constraints and variables occurring in UDRS conditions  )   2 The translation recurses on the semantic ontributions of verbs  .

PREDII 0  \ [ \ ]  12The definition below ignores subordination constraints  . It assumes proper UDRSs , i . e . UDRS where all the discourse referents are properly bound  . Thus the definition implements the " garbage in- garbage out " principle  . It also assumes that discourse referents in " quantifier prefixes " are disjoint  . It is straightforward to extend the definition to take account of subordina-t ~ ion constraints if that is desired but  , as were marked above , the translation image ( the resulting fstructures ) cannot in all cases reflect the constraints .

The reason is that that fstructures do not represent partial subordination constraints  , in other words they are fully underspecified . Finally , note that r and r-1 are recursive ( they allow for arbitrary embeddings of e . g . sentential complements ) . 
This may lead to structures outside the first -order UDRT-fragment  . As an example the reader may want to check the translation in Figure  3 and furthermore verify that the reverse translation does indeed take us back to the original  ( modulo renaming of variables and labels ) UDRS .
