The EUC opernicus project Multext-East has created a multi-lingual corpus of text and speech data  , covering the six languages of the project : Bulgarian  , Czech , Estonian , Hungarian , Romanian , and Slovene . In addition , wordform lexicons for each of the languages were developed  . The corpus includes a parallel component consisting of Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four  , with versions in all six languages tagged for part-of-speech and aligned to English  ( also tagged for POS )  . We describe the encoding format and data architectured signed especially for this corpus  , which is generally usable for encoding linguistic or pora  . We also describe the methodology for the development of a harmonized set of morphosyntactic descriptions  ( MSDs )  , which builds upon the scheme for western European languages developed within the EAGLES project  . We discuss the special concerns for handling the six project languages  , which cover three distinct language families . 
Introduction
In order to provide resources to enable the efficient extraction of quantitative and qualitative information from corpora  , several corpus development and distribution efforts have been recently established  . However , few corpora exist for Central and Eastern European  ( CEE ) languages , and corpus-processing tools that take into account he specific characteristics of these languages are virtually nonexistent  . 
The Multext-East Copernicus projec0 ( Erjavec , et al ,  1997 ) was a spinoff of the LRE project Multext2 ( Ide and Vtronis ,  1994 ) intended to fill these gaps by developing significant resources for six CEE languages  ( Bulgarian , Czech , Estonian , Hungarian , Romanian , Slovene ) that follow a consistent and principled encoding format and are maximally suited to easy processing by corpus-handling tools  . To this end , Multext-East developed a corpus of parallel and comparable texts for the sixCEE project languages  , together with wordform lexicons and other language-specific resources  . In the following sections we briefly describe the Multext-East corpora  ( text , speech ) and the Multext-East lexicons and language -specific resources  . 
1 The Multext-East corpora 1 . 1 Encoding format Based on the principle that its corpus encoding format should be standardized and homogeneous both for interchange and for facilitating open-ended retrieval tasks  , Multext-East adopted the lhttp://nl . ijs . si/ME 2http://www . lpl . univ-aix . fr/projects/Multext / which has been developed to be optimally suited for use in language engineering and corpus-based work  . The CES is an application of SGML ( ISO-8879 , Standard Generalized Markup Language ) and is based on the TEl Guidelines for Electronic Text Encoding and Interchange  . 
In addition to providing encoding conventions for elements relevant to corpus-based work  , the CES provides a data architecture for linguistic corpora and their annotations  . Each corpus component , comprising a single text and its annotations , is organized as a hyper-document , with various levels of annotation stored in separate SGML documents  ( each with a separate DTD )  . Low-density ( i . e . , above the token level ) annotation is expressed indirectly in terms of interdocument links  . Markup for different types of annotation ( e . g . , part of speech , alignment , etc . ) is described by a separate Data Type Definition ( DTD ) specifically tailored to that information . 
1.2 The parallel corpus
The Multext-East parallel corpus consists of seven translations of George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty -Four : besides the original English version  , the corpus contains translations in the six project languages  . There are three versions of each text in the parallel corpus  , corresponding to different levels of annotation : aces Docencoding  ( SGML markup up to the sub-paragraph level , including markup for sentence boundaries ) ; and aces Anaencoding , containing word-level morphosyntactic markup together with links to each sentence  ( and in some versions , to each word ) in the cesDoc version . A fourth document , the cesAlign document , is associated with each of the non-English versions  , which includes links between sentences in the cesDoc encoding for each and the English version  , thus providing a parallel alignment at the sentence level  . The cesAnaversions , which are the most linguistically 3 The CES was developed in a joint effort of the European projects Multext  ( LRE ) and EAGLES ( in particular , the EAGLES Text Representation subgroup ) , together with the Vassar/CNRS collaboration ( supported by the U . S . National
Science Foundation).

All possible morphosyntactic interpretations of the token are given in the < lox > field consisting of the baseform  , a morphosyntactic description ( see Section 2) , and an associated corpus tag . The < disamb > field contains the interpretation that has been identified as valid within the respective context  ; within this tag , the < eeag > element provides the corresponding corpus tag  ( see section 2 )  . 4 The 4In the Czech and Slovene versions , <ctag > is omitted because its contents are identical to the < msd > tag contents  . 
3 16 disambiguation feach language version in the parallel corpus was ao complished using automatic POS tagging algorithms and then partially or entirely hand-validated  . 
Table 1 provides the main characteristics per language of this corpus  . In this table : ? to k = number of tokens ? words = number of lexical items  ( excluding punctuation ) ? lex = number of MSD-based interpretations of the words in the text ? MSD/amb = average ratio of the number of lexical variants per word The texts from the corpora were segmented using the corpus annotation tool set developed within the Multext project  , augmented by language-specific resources developed by Multext-East  . The Multext segmenter is a language-independent and configurable tokenizer whose output includes token  , paragraph and sentence boundary markers . 
Punctuation , lexical items , numbers , and various alphanumeric sequences ( such as dates and hours ) are annotated with tags defined in a hierarchical  , class-structured tagset . The language-specific behavior of the segmenter is enabled by its engine-driven design  , in which all language-specific information is provided as data  . Within Multext-East , resource data , including rules describing the form of sentence boundaries  , word splitting ( cliticized forms decomposition ) , word compounding , quotations , numbers , dates , punctuation , capitalization , abbreviations etc . , was developed for the six project languages . 
Once the input text was tokenized , a dictionary lookup procedure was used to assign each lexical token all its possible morphosyntactic descriptors  ( MSDs )  . The ambiguously MSD-annotated texts were then hand-disambiguated  ( entirely for some languages and partially for the others  )  . This time-consuming and error-prone process was spedup significantly by a special XEMACS mode  , developed within the project , which is aware of the morphosyntactic descriptors ' ignificance and allows for natural language xpansion of the linear encoding of the MSDs  . The ambiguously MSD-annotated texts and the corresponding disambiguated texts provided the basis for building the cesAna encoded version of the multilingual parallel corpus  . 
The corpus also contain six language pairwise alignments between each of the six project languages and English  . The alignments were performed by three different automatic aligners  ( Multext-aligner , " vanilla-aligner " , Silfide-aligner ) with accuracy ranging between 75-90% , and then handvalidated . Table 2 shows the distribution of sentence alignments for each pair of languages  . 
1.3 Multilingual comparable corpus
Multext-East also produced a multilingual comparab le corpus  , including two subsets of at least 100 , 0 00 words each for each of the six project languages . The texts include fiction , comprising a single novel or excerpts from several novels  , and newspaper data . 
The data is comparable across the six languages , in terms of the number and size of texts . The entire multilingual comparable corpus was prepared in CES format manually or using ad hoc tools  .

Accommodating the different language families represented among the Multext-East languages demanded substantialssessment and modification of the preexisting specifications  , which were originally developed for western European languages only  . 
For corpus morpholexical processing purposes , the Multext-East consortium developed language -specific wordform dictionaries  , which , for all languages except Estonian and Hungarian , contain the full inflectional paradigm for at least the lemmas appearing in the corpus  . 
Each dictionary entry has the following structure : wordform\[TAB\]  1emma \[ TAB\]MSD\[TAB\]where wordform represents an inflected form of the lemma  , characterised by a combination of feature values encoded by a Morphosyntactic Description  ( MSD )  . The Multext-East lexicons and MSDs are fully described in Tufts  , Ide , and
Erjavec (1998).
A general overview of the lexicons is shown in Table  3  . The Entries column provides the number of dictionary entries  , that is , triplets : < wordform lemma MSD > . The Wordforms column gives the number of distinct wordforms appearing in the lexicon  , irrespective of their lemm and MSD . The Lemma column gives the number of distinct lemmas in the lexicon  , eliminating duplications that appear due to lemma homography  . The difference between the Lemma and "=" fields provides an estimate of the number of homographic lemmas  . The MSD field gives the total number of distinct MSDs used in the encoding of the lexicon stock  . 
The last two columns in Table 3 ( AMB_POS and AMB_MSD ) provide information about he number of ambiguity classification clusters  . An ambiguity classification cluster provides the number of ways a homographic wordform can be classified  . AMB_POS ( " part of speech ambiguity " ) and AMB_MSD ( " MSD-ambiguity " ) provide the classification based on the part of speech and MSD  , respectively . The number of ambiguity classes ( based either on POS or MSD ) is a key figure in estimating the space needed to construct a statistical language morphosyntactic disambiguation  . This number was a key factor in the tagset design . 
For several of the project languages and for English  , a set of corpus tags has also been developed which are appropriate for use with stochastic disambiguators  . Where corpus tags have been developed , mapping rules from MSDs to corpus tags ( n-to-1 mapping ) are also provided as a resource .

The multilingual resources ( lexicons , rules , corpora ) developed in Multext-East are among of the most comprehensiver sources currently available for most of the project languages  . In addition to resource development , the work carried out in Multext-East has contributed significantly to defining general mechanisms for lexical specification  , and it has provided a test of
