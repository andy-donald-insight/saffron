The term word assaciation is used in a very particular sense in the psycholinguistic literature  . 
( Generally speaking , subjects respond quicker than normal to the word " nurse " if it follows a highly associated word such as " doctor  . " ) We wilt extend the term to provide the basis for a statistical description of a variety of interesting linguistic phenomena  , ranging from semantic relations of the doctor /nurse type  ( content word/content word ) to lexicosyntactico-occurrence constraints between verbs and prepositions  ( content word/function word )  . This paper will propose a new objective measure based on the information theoretic notion of mutual information  , for estimating word association or ms from compute readable corpora  . 
(The standard method of obtaining word association norms  , testing a few thousand subjects on a few hundred words  , is both costly and unreliable . ) The , proposed measure , the association ratio , estimates word association norms directly from computer readable corpora  , waki , ~ g it possible to estimate norms for tens of thousands of words  . 
I . Meaning and Association
It is common practice in linguistics to classify words not only on the basis of their meanings but also on the basis of their cooccurrence with other words  . 
Running through the whole Firthian tradition , for example , is the theme that " Youshall know a word by the company it keeps "  ( Firth ,  1957) . 
" On the one hand , bank ? o . occors with words and expression such umoney , nmu . loan , account , ~ m . c~z~c . 
o~ . ctal , manager , obbery , vaults , wortln  #in a , luaction , Fb ~ Nadonal . of F . ngl and , and so forth . On the other hand , we find bankm-occorring with r~r . ~ bn , boa: . am ( end of course West and Sou ~ , which have tcqu/red special meanings of their own  )  , on top of the , and of the Rhine . "\[ Hanks (1987), p .   127\] The search for increasingly delicate word classes is not new  . In lexicography , for example , it goes back at least to the " verb patterns " described in Horn by's Advanced Learner's Dictionary  ( first edition 1948 )  . 
What is new is that facilities for the computational storage and analysis of large bodies of natural language have developed significantly in recent years  , so that it is now becoming possible to test and apply informal assertions of this kind in a more do keep  . 
2. Practical Applications
The proposed statistical description has a large number of potentially important applications  , including : ( a ) constraining the language model both for speech recognition and optical character recognition  ( OCR )  ,   ( b ) providing disambiguation cues for parsing highly ambiguous syntactic structure such as noun compounds  , conjunctions , and prepositional phrases , ( c ) retrieving texts from large databases ( e . g . , newspapers , patents ) ,   ( d ) enhancing the productivity of computational linguists in compiling lexicons of lexicosyntactic facts  , and ( e ) enhancing the productivity of lexicographers in identifying normal and conventional usage  . 
Consider the optical character recognizer ( OCR ) application . Suppose that we have an OCR device such as \[ Kahan  , Pavlidis , Baird (1987)\] , and it has assigned about equal probability to having recognized " farm " and " form  , " where the context is either: ( 1 ) " federalt credit " or ( 2 ) " some of . " The proposed association measure can make use of the fact that " farm " is much more likely in the first context and " form " is much more likely in the second to resolve the ambiguity  . Note that alternative disambiguation methods based on syntactic constraint such as part of speech are unlikely to help in this case since both " form " and " farm " are commonly used as nouns  . 
3 . Word Association and Psycholingui~tics Word association or ms are wellknown to be an important factor in psycholinguistic research  , especially in the area of lexical retrieval . Generally speaking , subjects respond quicker than normal to the word " nurse " if it follows a highly associated word such as " doctor  . "" Some resuhs and impl~tfions ere summarized from rexc fion-fime  . experiments in which subjects either ( a ) ~ as ~ f'mi successive strings of lenen as words and nonwords  , c ~( b ) pronounced the sUn riSe . Both types of response to words ( e . g . , BUTTER ) were consistently fester when preceded by associated words  ( e . g . , BREAD ) rather than unassociated words ( e . g , NURSE ) . "\[ Meyer , Schvaneveldt and Ruddy (1975), p .   98\] Much of this psycholinguistic research is based on empirical estimates of word association or ms such as \[ Palermo and Jenkins  ( 1964 ) \] , perhaps the most influential study of its kind , though extremely small and somewhat dated . This study measured 200 words by asking a few thousand subjects to write down a word after each of the  200 words to be measured . Results are reported in tabular form , indicating which words were written down , and by how many subjects , factored by grade level and sex . 
The word " doctor , " for example , is reported on pp . 
98-100 , to be most often associated with " nurse , " followed by " sick , "" health , "" medicine , "" hospital , "" man , "" sickness , "" lawyer , " and about 70 more words . 
4. An Information Theoretic Measure
We propose an alternative measure , the association ratio , for measuring word association or ms , based on the information theoretic concept of mutual information  . The proposed measure is more objective and less costly than the subjective method employed in \[ Palermo and Jenkins  ( 1964 ) \] . The association ratio can be scaled up to provide robust estimates of word association norms for a large portion of the language  . Using the association ratio measure , the five most associated words are ( in order ) : " dentists , "" nurses , "" treating , "" treat , " and " hospitals . "What is " mutual information "? According to \ [ Fano  ( 1961 )  , p .  28\] , if two points ( words ) , x and y , have probabilities P ( x ) and P ( y ) , then their mutual information , l(x , y ) , is defined to bel(x , y)-Io-P ( x , y)s2P ( x)P ( y)Informally , mutual information compares the probability of observing x and y together  ( the joint probability ) with the probabilities of observing x and y independently  ( chance )  . If there is a genuine association between x and y  , then the joint probability P(x , y ) will be much larger than chance P ( x)P ( y ) , and consequently l(x , y ) > > 0 . If there is no interesting relationship between x and y  , then P(x , y ) ~ P ( x)P ( y) , and thus , I(x , y ) ~-0 . 
If x and y are in complementary distribution , then P(x , y ) will be much less than P ( x)P ( y) , forcing l(x , y ) < < O . 
In our application , word probabilities , P ( x ) and P ( y) , are estimated by counting the number of observations of x and y in a corpus  , f(x ) and f(y ) , and normalizing by N , the size of the corpus .   ( Our examples use a number of different corpora with different sizes :  15 million words for the 1987 AP and 8  . 6 million tokens for the tagged corpus . ) Joint probabilities , P ( x , y ) , are estimated by counting the number of times that x is followed by y in a window of w words  , f , ,(x , y ) , and normalizing by N . 
The window size parameter allows us to look at different scales  . Smaller window sizes will identify fixed expressions  ( idioms ) and other relations that hold over short ranges ; larger window sizes will highlight semantic concepts and other relationships that hold over larger scales  . For the remainder of this paper , the window size , w , will be set to 5 words as a compromise ; this setting is large enough to show some of the constraints between verbs and arguments  , but not so large that it would was hout constraints that make use of strict adjacency  . 1 Since the association ratio becomes unstable when the counts are very small  , we will not discuss word pairs with f(x , y ) $5 . An improvement would make use of t-scores , and throwout pairs that were not significant . Unfortunately , this requffes an estimate of the variance of f(x , y ) , which goes beyond the scope of this paper . For the remainder of this paper , we will adopt the simple but arbitrary threshold , and ignore pairs with small counts . 
Technically , the association ratio is different from mutual information in two respects  . First , joint probabilities are supposed to be symmetric : P  ( x , y ) = P ( y , x ) , and thus , mutual information is also symmetric : l(x , y)=l(y , x ) . However , the association ratio is not symmetric , since f(x , y ) encodes linear precedence . ( Recall that f(x , y ) denotes the number of times that word x appears before y in the window of w words  , not the number of times the two words appear in either order  . ) Although we could fix this problem by redefining f  ( x , y ) to be symmetric ( by averaging the matrix with its transpose )  , we have decided not to do so , since order information appears to be very interesting  . Notice the asymmetry in the pairs below ( computed from 36 million words of 1988AP text )  , illustrating a wide variety of biases ranging 1 . This definition f w(x , y ) uses ? rectangular window . It might bc interesting to consider alternatives ( e . g . , ? triangular window or ? decaying exponential ) that would weight words less and less as they are separated by more and more words  .

For example , given the sentence , " Library workers were prohibited from saving books from this heap of ruins  , " which appeared in an AP story on Aprill ,  1988 , f(prohibited ) ffi1 and f(prohibited , from ) ffi2 . 
This problem can he fixed by dividing f(x , y ) by w-I ( which has the consequence of subtracting Iog2 ( w-l ) --2 from our association ratio scores )  . This adjustment has the additional benefit of assuring that ~ f  ( x , y)ffi~f(x ) ffi~f(y)ffiN . 
When l(x , y ) is large , the association ratio produces very credible results not unlike those reported in ~ alermo and Jenkins  ( 1964 ) \] , as illustrated in the tabl ~ below . In contrast , when l(x , y ) ~0 , the pairs less interesting . ( As a very rough rule of thumb , we have observed that pairs with l(x , y ) > 3 tend to be interesting , and pairs with smaller l(x , y ) are generally not . One can make this statement precise by calibrating the measure with subjective measures  . 
Alternatively , one could make estimates of the variance and then make statements about confidence levels  , e . g . , with 95% confidence , P(x , y ) >
P ( x)P ( y).)

However , we are rarely able to Observel(x , y ) << O because our corpora are too small ( and our measurement techniques are too crude )  . Suppose , for example , that both x and y appear about i0 times per million words of text . Then , P ( x ) =P ( y ) = iO-s and chance is P ( x ) P ( x ) ffitO-l ? . Thus , to say that l(x , y ) is much less than 0 , we need to say that P ( x , y ) is much less than 10-~? a statement that is hard to make with much confidence given the size of presently available corpora  . In fact , we cannot ( easily ) observe a probability less than 1/N = 10-7 , and therefore , it is hard to knowf fl(x , y ) is much less than chance or not , unless chance is very large . ( In fact , the pair ( a , doctors ) above , appears significantly less often than chance . 
But to justify this statement , we need to compensate for the window size ( which shifts the score downward by 2 . 0, e . g . from 0 . 96 downto-1 . 04 ) and we need to estimate the standard deviation , using a method such as \[ Good (1953)\] . ) 5 . Lexico-$yntactic Regularities Although the psycholinguistic literature documents the significance of noun/noun word associations such as doctor/nurse in considerable detail  , relatively little is said about associations among verbs  , function words , adjectives , and other nonnouns . In addition to identifying semantic relations of the doctor/nurse variety  , we believe the association ratio can also be used to search for interesting lexicosyntactic relationships between verbs and typical arguments /adjuncts  . The proposed association ratio can be viewed as a formalization of Sinciair's argument : " How common are the phrasal verbs with  set7 Set is particularly rich in making combinations with words like about  , in , up , out , on , off , and these words are themselves very common . How likely is set off to occur ? Both are frequent words  ; \[set occurs approximately 250 times in a million words and \] off occurs approximately  556 times in a million words . . . IT\]he question we are asking can be roughly rephrased as follows : how Likely is off to occur immediately after set ?  . . . This is 0 . 00025x0 . 00055\[P ( x)P ( y)\] , which gives us the tiny figure of 0 . 0000001375  . . . The assumption behind this calculation is that the words are distributed at random in a text\[ at chance  , in our terminology \] . It is obvious to a linguist that this is not so , and a cough measure of how much set and off attract each other is to cump are the probability with what actually happens  . . . $ ~ offo ~ urs nearly 70 times in the 7 . 3 million word corpus\[P ( x , y ) -70/(7 . 3106) >> P ( x)P ( y)\] . 
That is enough to show its main patterning and it suggests that incurrently-held corpora there will be found sufficient evidence for the desc ~ ' iption of a substantial collection of phrases  . . . \[Sinclair (1987) ? . pp . 151-152\] It happens that set . . . off was found 177 times in the 1987 AP Corpus of approximately 15 million words , about the same number of occurrences per million as S in clair found in his  ( mainly British ) corpus . 
Quantitatively , l(set , off ) = 5 . 9982, indicating that the probability of set . . . of f is almost 64 times greater than chance . This association is relatively strong ; the other particles that S incliir mentions have association ratios of : about  ( 1 . 4), in (2 . 9), up (6 . 9), out (4 . 5), on (3 . 3) in the 1987 AP Corpus . 
As Sinclair suggests , the approach is well suited for identifying phrasal verbs  . However , phrasal verbs involving the preposition to raise an interesting problem because of the possible confusion with the infinitive marker to  . We have found that if we first tag every word in the corpus with a part of speech using a method such as \[ Church  ( 1988 ) \] , and then measure associations between tagged words  , we can identify interesting contrasts between verbs associated with a following preposition to ~ in and verbs associated with a following infinitive marker to ~ to  .   ( Part of speech notation is borrowed from \[ Francis and Kucera  ( 1982 ) \] ; in = preposition ; to = infinitive marker ; vb = bare verb ; vbg = verb+ins ; vbd = verb+ed ; vbz = verb+s ; vbn = verb+en . ) The association ratio identifies quite a number of verbs associated in an interesting way with to  ; restricting our attention to pairs with a score of  3  . 0 or more , there are 768 verbs associated with the preposition to ~ in and 551 verbs with the infinitive marker to ~ to . The ten verbs found to be most associated before to ~ in are : ? to ~ in : alluding/vbg  , adhere/vb , amounted/vbn , re-lating/vbg , amounting/vbg , revert/vb , re-verted/vbn , resorting/vbg , relegated/vbn ? to ~ to : obligated/vbn , trying/vbg , compened/vbn , enables/vbz , supposed/vbn , intends/vbz , vow-ing/vbg , tried/vbd , enabling/vbg , tends/vbz , tend/vb , intend/vb , tries/vbz Thus , we see there is considerable leverage to be gained by preprocessing the corpus and manipulating the inventory of tokens  . For measuring syntactic constraints , it may be useful to include some part of speech information and to exclude much of the internal structure of noun phrases  . For other purposes , it may be helpful to tag items and/or phrases with semantic libels such as * person *  , * place * , * time * , * body part * , * bad * , etc . Hindle ( personal communication ) has found it helpful to preprocess the input with the Fidditch parser ~ I-  . Iindle (1983a , b ) \] in order to identify associations between verbs and arguments  , and postulate semantic lasses for nouns on this basis  . 
6. Applications in Lexicography
Large machine-readable corpora are only just now becoming available to lexicographers  . Up to now , lexicographers have been reliant either on citations collected by human readers  , which introduced an element of selectivity and so inevitably distortion  ( rare words and uses were collected but common uses of common words were not  )  , or on small corpora of only a million words or so  , which are reliably informative for only the most common uses of the few most frequent words of English  .   ( A million-word corpus such as the Brown Corpus is reliable  , roughly , for only some uses of only some of the forms of around  4000 dictionary entries . But standard dictionaries typically contain twenty times this number of entries  . ) The computational tools available for studying machine-readable corpora are at present still rather primitive  . There are concordancing programs ( see Figure 1 at the end of this paper )  , which are basically KWIC ( keyword in context\[Aho , Kernighan , and Weinberger (1988) , p .  122\] ) indexes with additional feature such as the ability to extend the context  , sort leftwards as well as rightwards , and so on . There is very little interactive software . 
In a typical skuation in the lexicography of the 1980s   , a lexicographer is given the concordances for a word  , marks up the print out with colored pens in order to identify the salient senses  , and then writes syntactic descriptions and definitions  . 
Although this technology is a great improvement on using human readers to collect boxes of citation index cards  ( the method Murray used in constructing the Oxford English Dictionary a century ago  )  , it works well if there are no more than a few dozen concordance lines for a word  , and only two or three main sense divisions . In analyzing a complex word such as " take " , " save " , or " from " , the lexicographer is trying to pick out significant patterns and subtle distinctions that are buried in literally thousands of concordance lines : pages and pages of computer print out  . The unaided human mind simply cannot discover all the significant patterns  , let alne group them and rank in order of importance  . 
The AP 1987 concordance to " save " is many pages and many more for the inflected forms " saved  , "" saves , " saving , " and " savings . " In the discussion that follows , we shall , for the sake of simplicity , not analyze the inflected forms and we shall only look at the patterns to the right of " save "  .

I8724 save 9249 company 4 . 1  6   724 save 7114 month It is hard to know what is important in such a concordance and what is not  . For example , although it is easy to see from the concordance selection in Figure  1 that the word " to " often comes before " save " and the word " the " often comes after " save  , " it is hard to say from examination of a concordance alone whether either or both of these cooccurrences have any significance  . 
Two examples will be illustrate how the association ratio measure helps make the analysis both quicker and more accurate  . 
806.1F.xamp/e1:"save ... from "
The association ratios ( above ) show that association norms apply to function words as well as content words  . For example , one of the words significantly associated with " save " is " from "  . Many dictionaries , for example Merriam-Webster's Ninth , make no explicit mention of " from " in the entry for " save "  , although British learners ' dictionaries do make specific mention of " from " in connection with " save "  . These learners ' dictionaries pay more attention to language structure and collocation than do American collegiate dictionaries  , and lexicographers trained in the British tradition are often fairly skilled at spotting these generalizations  . 
However , teasing out such facts , and distinguishing true intuitions from false intuitions takes a lot of time and hard work  , and there is a high probability of inconsistencies and omissions  . 
Which other verbs typically associate with " from , " and where does " save " rank in such a list ? The association ratio identified  1530 words that are associated with " from " ; 911 of them were tagged as verbs . The first I00 verbs are : refi'aJn/vb , gleaned/vii , stems/vbz , stemmed/vbd , stem-mins/vbg , renging/vbg , stemmed/vii , ranged/vii , derived/vii , reng~/vbd , extort/vb , graduted/vbd , bar-red/vii , benefltiag/vbg , benefmect/vii , benefited/vii , ex-?used/vbd , m ' hing/vbg , range/vb , exempts/vbz , suffers/vbz , exempting tv bg , benefited/vbd , In . evented/vbd (7 . 0) , seep-ins/vbs , btrted/vbd , tnevents/vbz , suffering/vbs , ex-e . laded/vii , mtrks/vbz , pmf it in ~ vbs , recover in s/vbg , dis-charged/vii , rebound in s/v bg , vary/vb , exempted/vbn , ~ te/vb , blmished/vii , with drawing/vbg , ferry/vb , pre-vented/vii , pmfit/vb , bar/vb , excused/vii , bars/vbz , bene-fit/vb , emerget/vbz , em~se/vb , vm'tes/vbz , differ/vb , re-moved/vim , exeml n/vb , expened/vbn , withdraw/vb , stem/vb , separated/vii , judging/vbg , adapted/vbn , escapins/vbs , in-herited/vii , differed/vbd , emerged/vbd , with held/vbd , kaked/vbn , strip/vb , i ~ mlting/vbs , discouruge/vb , I ~' e-vent/vb , withdrew/vbd , pmhibits/vbz , borrowing/vbg , pre-ving/vbg , prohibit/vb , resulted/vbd (6 . 0) , predude/vb , di-vert/vb , dist in ~ hh/vb , pulled/vbn , fell/vbn , varied/vbn , emerging/vbs , su He ~ r/vb , prohibiting/vbg , extract/vb , sub-U'act/vb , remver A , b paralyzed/vii , stole/vbd , departing/vbs , escaped/vii , l ~ ohibited/vbn , forbid/vb , evacuated/vii , reap/vb , barring/vbg , removing/vbg , stolen/vii , receives/vbz . 
" Save . . . from " is a good example for illustrating the advantages of the association ratio  . Save is ranked 319th in this list , indicating that the association is modest , strong enough to be important ( 21 times more likely than chance )  , but not so strong that it would pop out at us in a concordance  , or that it would be one of the first things to come to mind  . 
If the dictionary is going to list " save . . . from , " then , for consistency's sake , it ought to consider listing all of the more important associations as well  . 
Of the 27 bare verbs ( tagged ' vb3 in the list above , all but 7 are listed in the Cobuild dictionary as occurring with " from "  . However , this dictionary does not note that vary , ferry , strip , divert , for bid , and reap occur with " from . " If the Cobuild lexicographers had had access to the proposed measure  , they could possibly have obtained better coverage at less cost  . 
6 . 2 Example 2: Identifying Semantic Classes Having established the relative importance of " save  . . . from " , and having noted that the two words are rarely adjacent  , we would now like to speed up the labor-intensive task of categorizing the concordance lines  . Ideally , we would like to develop a set of semiautomatic tools that would help a lexicographer produce something like Figure  2  , which provides an annotated summary of the 65 concordance lines for " save . . . from . '' a The " save . . . from " pattern occurs in about 10% of the 666 concordance lines for " save . " Traditionally , semantic categories have been only vaguely recognized  , and to date little effort has been devoted to a systematic classification of a large corpus  . Lexicographers have tended to use concordances impressionistically  ; semantic theorist , AI-ers , and others have concentrated on a few interesting examples  , e . g . , '* bachelor , " and have not given much thought to how the results might be scaled up  . 
With this concern in mind , it seems reasonable to ask how well these 65 lines for " save . . . from " fit in with all other uses of " save "? . A laborious concordance analysis was undertaken to answer this question  . When it was nearing completion , we noticed that the tags that we were inventing to capture the generalizations could in most cases have been suggested by looking at the lexical items listed in the association ratio table for " save "  . For example , we had failed to notice the significance of time adverbials in our analysis of " save  , " and no 2 . The last unclass if a at line , " . . . save shop persany where from $ S0 . . . " raise simeres ~ g problems . Syntactic " chunking " shows that , in spite of its ~ o-coear reaoe of " from " with " save "  , this line does ant belong hm'e . An intriguing exerciw , given the lookup table we are trying to construct  , is how to guard against false inferences such u that since " shop pm's"i tagged\[PERSON\]  ,   "$$0 to 5500" must here countue it her BADm " a LOCATION . Accidental coincid mlces of this kind do not have a significant effect on the measure  , however , although they do secve as a reminder of the probabilistic nature of the findings  . 
dictionary records this . Yet it should be clear from the association ratio table above that " annually " and " month  ''3 are commonly found with " save " . More detailed inspection shows that the time adverbials correlate interestingly with just one group of " save " objects  , namely those tagged \[ MONEY\] . The AP wire is fuU of discussions of " saving $1 . 2 billion per month " ; computational lexicography should measure and record such patterns ff they are general  , even when traditional dictionaries do not . 
As another example illustrating how the association ratio tables would have helped us analyze the " save " concordance lines  , we found ourselves contemplating the semantic tag ENV  ( IRONMENT ) in order to analyze lines such as : the trend to it's our turn to joined a fight to can we get busy to save the forests\[ENV\]save the lake\ [ ENV\]  , save their forests\[ENV\] , save the planet\[ENV\]?If we had looked at the association ratio tables before labeling the  65 lines for " save . . . from , " we might have noticed the very large value for " save  . . . 
forests , " suggesting that there may be an important pattern here  . In fact , this pattern probably subsumes most of the occurrences of the " save\[ANIMAL \]" pattern noticed in Figure  2  . Thus , tables do not provide semantic tags , but they provide a powerful set of suggestions to the lexicographer for what needs to be accounted for in choosing a set of semantic tags  . 
It may be that everything said here about " save " and other words is true only of  1987 American journales e . Intuitively , however , many of the patterns discovered seem to be good candidates for conventions of general English  . A future step would be to examine other more balanced corpora and test how well the patterns hold up  . 
7. Conclu Mom
We began this paper with the psycholinguistic notion ? of word association or m  , and extended that concept toward the information theoretic def'mition of mutual information  . This provided a precise statistical calculation that could be applied to a very  3  . The word " time " itself also occurs significantly in the table  , but on clco~examination it is clear that this use of " time "  ( e . g . , " to save time " ) counts as something like a commodity or resource , not as part of a time adjunct . Such are the pitfalls of lexicography ( obvious when they are pointed out )  . 
8 1 large corpus of text in order to produce a table of associations for tens of thousands of words  , We were then able to show that the table encoded a number of very interesting patterns ranging from doctor  . . . nurse to save . . . from . We finally concluded by showing how the patterns in the association ratiotable might help a lexicographer organize a concordance  . 
In point of fact , we actually developed these resuks in basically the reverse order  . Concordance analysis is stilt extremely labor -intensive  , and prone to errors of omission . The ways that concordances are sorted don't adequately support current lexicographic practice  . Despite the fact that a concordance is indexed by a single word  , often lexicographers actually use a second word such as " from " or an equally common semantic concept such as a time adverbial to decide how to categorize concordance lines  . In other words , they use two words to triangulate in on a word sense  . This triangulation approach clusters concordance Lines together into word senses based primarily on usage  ( distributional evidence )  , as opposed to intuitive notions of meaning . Thus , the question of what is a word sense can be addressed with syntactic methods  ( symbol pushing )  , and need not address semantics ( interpretation ) , even though the inventory of tags may appear to have semantic values  . 
The triangulation approach requires " art . " How does the lexicographer decide which potential cut points are " interesting " and which are merely due to chance ? The proposed association ratio score provides a practical and objective measure which is often a fairly good approximation to the " art  . " Since the proposed measure is objective , it can be applied in a systematic way over a large body of material  , steadily improving consistency and productivity . 
But on the other hand , the objective score can be misleading . The score takes only distributional evidence into account  . For example , the measure favors " set . . . for " over " set . . . down " ; it doesn't know that the former is less interesting because its semantics are compositional  . In addition , the measure is extremely superficial ; it cannot cluster words into appropriate syntactic classes without an explicit preprocess uchasChurch's parts program " or Hindle's parser  . Neither of these preprocesses , though , can help highlight the " natural " similarity between ouns such as " picture " and " photograph  . " Although one might imagine a preprocess that would help in this particular case  , there will probably always be a class of generalizations that are obvious beyond the objectivity of a computer  . 
Despite these problems , the association ratio could be an important ool to aid the lexicographer  , ather like an index to the concordances , It can help us decide what to look for ; it provides a quick summary of what company our words do keep  .
