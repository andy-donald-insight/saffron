In computational linguistics , which began in the 1950's with machine translation , systems that are based mainly on the lexicon have a longer tradition than anything else --- for these purposes  , twentyfive years must be allowed to count as a tradition  . The bulk of many of the early translation systems was made up by a dictionary whose entries consisted of arbitrary instructions In machine language  . In the early 60's , computation alllnsulsts --- at least those with theoretical pretent lons---abandoned this way of doing business for at least three related reasons : First systems containing large amounts of unrestricted machine codefly in the face of ? II principles of good programming practice  . The syntax of the language in which linguistic facts are state disso remote from their semantics that the opportunities for error are very great and no assumptions can be made ? bout the effects on the system of Invoking the code associated wlth any given word  . The systems became virtually unmaintain abl ? and eventually fell under their own weight  . Furthermore , these failings were magnified as soon as the attempt was made to impose more structure on the overall system  . A general backtracking sohs me . 
for example , could ?11 too easily be thrown into completed is array by an instruction in ssing l ? dictionary entry that affected the control stack  . 
Second . the power of general , and particularly nondeterminlst lc , algorithms In syntactic analysis came to be appreciated  , if not overappreciated . 
Suddenly . It was no longer necessary to seek local crite ria on which to ensure the correctness of individual decisions made by the program provided they were covered by more global criteria  . Separation of program and linguistic data became an overriding principle and  . since it was most readily applied to syntactic rules  , these became them aln focus of attention . 
The third , and doubtless the most important , reason for the change was that syntactic theories in which ? grammar was seen as consisting of ? set of rules  . 
preferably including transformational rules , captured the Imagination of the most influent i alnonoom putational linguists  , and computational linguists followed suite if only to maintain theoretical respsotablllty  . In short , Systems with small sets of rules in ? constrained formalism and simple lexlcal entries apparently made for simpler  . 
cleaner , and more powerful programs while setting the whole enterprise on a sounder theoretical footing  . 
The trend is now In the opposite direction . There has been a shift of emphasis away from highly structured systems of complex rules as the principle repository of Information ? b out the syntax of ? language towards ? viewIn which the responsibility ia distributed among the lexicon  , semantic parts of the linguistic descript ion  , and ? cognitive or strategic component , Concomitantly . Interest has shifted from algorithms for syntactic analysis and generation  , tn which the control structure and the exact sequence of events are paramount  , to systems in which ? heavier burden Is carried by the data structure and in which the order o ~ events is ? matter of strategy  . This new trend is ? common thread running through several of the papers in this section  , Various techniques for syntactic analysis , not?sly those based on some form of Augmented Transition Network  ( ATN )  . represent grammatical facts In terms of executabl ? machine code  . The danger ? to which thin exposed the earlier system ? ? r?avoided by ln~i~t inR that this code by compiled from  8tat?ments in a torm ? llsm that allows only for lingutstica Jlymotivated operations on carefully controlled parts of certain data structures  . 
The value of nondeterminl?tic procedures is undlml ni ? hed  , but it has become clear that It does not rest on complex control structures and arigidly determined sequence of events  . In discussing the syntactic processors that we have developed  , for example , Ron Kaplan and Inolonger flndit usefulte talk in terms of a parsing algorithm  . There?re two central data structures , a chart and ? nagenda . When additions tO the charts l verise to certain kinds of configurations in which some element cont?t  , sexecutable code , ? task is created and placed on the ? good ? . Tasks are removed from the agenda and executed in an order determined by strategic considerations which constitute part cf the linguistic theory  . Strategy can determine only the order in which a lternative analyses are produced  . ~ any traditional distinctions , such as that between topdown and bottom-up processing  , no longer apply to the procedure as a whole but only to partlcuisr strategies or their parts  . 
Thls looser or snlzatlon of programs for syntactic processing came  . at least in pert . from e generally felt need to break down the boundaries that had traditionally separated morphological  , syntactic , and semantic processes . Research dlrect adtowards speech understanding systems was quite unable to r?spent these boundaries because  , in the face of unc , rtair data . local moves in the analysis on one lever required confirmation from other levels so thats common data structure for ? II levels of analysis and ? schedule that could change continually were of the esee no e  . Puthermore . there was a mouvement from within the art if i cial-intelligence community to eliminate the boundaries because  , frnm that perspective , they lacked sufficient theoretical
Justification.
Zn speech research In particular , and artificial Intelligence in general , the lexicon took on an important Position if only because it lath  , ~-~ e that the units or meaning reside . Recent pro . . sols t , linguistic theory involves larger role for the lexicon  . Eresnan ( 1978 ) has argued persuasively that the full mechanism of transformational rules can  . and should , be dispensed with except in cases Of U hbountte ~ movement such merel at lvlutlon and toploal last ~ cn  , The remaining members of the familiar ltst 0? transformations can be handled by weaker devices in the lexlcon and  , since they all turn out to ~ elexically ? yarned  . this IS the appropriate placet ~ state the information  .
