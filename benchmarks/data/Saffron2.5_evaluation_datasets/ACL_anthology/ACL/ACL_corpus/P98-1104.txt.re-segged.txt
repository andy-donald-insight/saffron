In this paper I will report the result of a quantitative analysis of the dynamics of the constituent elements of Japanese terminology  . In Japanese technical terms , the linguistic contribution of morphemes greatly differ according to their types of origin  . To analyse this aspect , a quantitative method is applied , which can properly characterise the dynamic nature of morphemes in terminology on the basis of a small sample  . 
1 Introduction
In computational linguistics , the interest interminological applications such as automatic term extraction is growing  , and many studies use the quantitative information  ( cf . Kageura & Umino , 1996) . However , the basic quantitative nature of terminological structure  , which is essential for terminological theory and applications  , has not yet been exploited . The static quantitative descriptions are not sufficient  , as there are terms which do not appear in the sample  . So it is crucial to establish some models , by which the terminological structure beyond the sample size can be properly described  . 
In Japanese terminology , the roles of morphemes are different according to their types of origin  , i . e . the morphemes borrowed mainly from Western languages  ( borrowed morphemes ) and the native morphemes including Chinese -origined morphemes which are the majority  . 
There are some quantitative studies ( Ishii , 1987; Nomura & Ishii ,  1989) , but they only treat the static nature of the sample  . 
Located in the intersection of these two backgrounds  , the aim of the present study is twofold , i . e .   ( 1 ) to introduce a quantitative framework in which the dynamic nature of terminology can be described  , and to examine its theoretical validity , and ( 2 ) to describe the quantitative dynamics of morphemes as a ' mass ' in Japanese terminology  , with reference to the types of origin . 
2 Terminological Data 2.1 The Data
We use a list of different terms as a sample , and observe the quantitative nature of the constituent elements or morphemes  . The quantitative regularities is expected to be observed at this level  , because a large portion of terms is complex ( Nomura & Ishii ,  1989) , whose formation is systematic ( Sager ,  1990) , and the quantitative nature of morphemes in terminology is independent of the token frequency of terms  , because the term formation is a lexical formation . 
With the correspondences between text and terminology  , sentences and terms , and words and morphemes , the present work can be regarded as parallel to the quantitative study of words in texts  ( Baayen , 1991; Baayen , 1993; Mandelbrot , 1962; Simon , 1955; Yule , 1944; Zipf ,  1935) . Such terms as ' type ' , ' token ' , ' vocabulary ' , etc . will be used in this context . 
Two Japanese terminological data are used in this study : computer science  ( CS:Aiso ,  1993 ) and psychology ( PS : Japanese Ministry of Education ,  1986) . The basic quantitative data are given in Table 1 , where T , N , and V(N ) indicate the number of terms , of running morphemes ( tokens ) , and of different morphemes ( types ) , respectively . 
In computer science , the frequencies of the borrowed and the native morphemes are not very different  . In psychology , the borrowed CS all 1498 3366 4051762 . 45 7 . 08 0 . 211"' borrowed 14696 280 95 . 23 0  . 242 native 21944 236 79 . 27 0  . 174P Sall 6272 14314 3594 2,285 . 98 0 . 235 borrowed 154 199 31 . 55 0 . 309 native 1277325994 . 91 0  . 207 Table 1 . Basic Figures of the Terminological Data morphemes constitute only slightly more than  10% of the tokens . The mean frequency N/V ( N ) of the borrowed morpheme simuch lower than the native morphemes in both domains  . 
2.2 LNRE Nature of the Data
The LNRE ( Large Number of Rare Events ) zone ( Chitashvili & Baayen ,  1993 ) is defined as the range of sample size where the population events  ( different morphemes ) are far from being exhausted . This is shown by the fact that the numbers of hapax legomen and of dislegomena are increasing  ( see Figure 1 for hapax )  . 
A convenient test to see if the sample is located in the LNRE zone is to see the ratio of loss of the number of morpheme types  , calculated by the sample relative frequencies as the estimates of population probabilities  . Assuming the binomial model , the ratio of loss is obtained by:
CL = ( V(N)-E\[V(N)\])/V(N ) ~'~ m>_lV(m , g ) (1-p(i\[f(i , N ) = m\] , N )) N
V ( N ) where : f(i , N ): frequency of a morpheme wi in a sample of N . 
p(i , N ) = f(i , N )/ N : sample relative frequency . 
m : frequency class or a number of occurrence.
V(m , N ) : the number of morpheme types occurring m times ( spectrum elements ) in a sample of N . 
In the two data , we underestimate the number of morpheme types by more than  20%   ( CL in Table 1 )  , which indicates that they are clearly located in the LNRE zone  . 
3 The LNRE Framework
When a sample is located in the LNRE zone , values of statistical measures such as type-token ratio  , the parameters of ' laws ' ( e . g . of Mandel-brot , 1962) of word frequency distributions , etc . 
change systematically according to the sample size  , due to the unobserved events . To treat LNRE samples , therefore , the factor of sample size should be taken into consideration  . 
Good ( 1953 ) gives a method of reestimating the population probabilities of the types in the sample as well as estimating the probability mass of unseen types  . There is also work on the estimation of the theoretical vocabulary size  ( Efron & Thisted , 1976; National Language Research Institute , 1958; Tuldava ,  1980) . However , they do not give means to estimate such values as V  ( N )  , V(m , N ) for arbitrary sample size , which are what we need . The LNRE framework ( Chitashvili & Baayen ,  1993 ) offers the mean suitable for the present study . 
3.1 Binomial/Poisson Assumption
Assume that there are S different morphemes wi , i = 1 , 2 ,  . . . S , in the terminological population , with a probability Pl associated with each of them  . Assuming the binomial distribution and its Poisson approximation  , we can express the expected numbers of morphemes and of spectrum elements in a given sample of size 
N as follows:
SS
E\[V(N)\]=S-E(1-pi)g=E(1_e-NP,) . (1) i=1 i=1$ i=1$=~--~(~p ,) ~ e-Np'/m ! . (2) i=1 As our data is in the LNRE zone , we cannot estimate Pi . Good ( 1953 ) and Good & Toulmin ( 1956 ) introduced the method of interpolating and extrapolating the number of types for arbitrary sample size  , but it cannot be used for extrapolating to a very large size  . 
3.2 The LNRE Models
Assume that the distribution of grouped probability p follows a distribution ' law '  , which can be expressed by some structural type distribution G  ( p ) s = ~ i=1 I\[p ~> p\] , where I = 1 when pi > P and 0 otherwise . Using G(p ) , the expressions ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) can be reexpressed as follows : E\[V ( N ) I = ( 1-e-~' ) da ( p )   . (3) where dG(p ) = G(pj)-G(pj+l ) around PJ , and 0 otherwise , in which p is now grouped for the same value and indexed by the subscript j that indicates in ascending order the values of p  . 
In using some explicit expressions such as log normal ' law '  ( Carrol , 1967) for G(p ) , we again face the problem of sample size dependency of the parameters of these ' laws '  . To overcome the problem , a certain distribution model for the population is assumed  , which manifests itself as one of the ' laws'at a pivotal sample size Z  . By explicitly incorporating Z as a parameter , the models can be completed , and it becomes possible ( i ) to represent the distribution of population probabilities by means of G  ( p ) with Z and to estimate the theoretical vocabulary size  , and ( ii ) to interpolate and extrapolate V ( N ) and V ( m , N ) to the arbitrary sample size
N , by such an expression:
E\[V(m , N ) \]=-- I=- ( ~ ( Z -'- P ) )'~ ) m ! e - ~ ( zP ) dG ( p ) The parameters of the model , i . e . the original parameters of the ' laws ' of word frequency distributions and the pivotal sample size Z  , are estimated by looking for the values that most properly describe the distributions of spectrum elements and the vocabulary size at the given sample size  . In this study , four LNRE models were tried , which incorporate the log normal ' law ' ( Carrol ,  1967) , the inverse Gauss-Poisson ' law ' ( Sichel ,  1986) , Zipf's ' law ' ( Zipf , 1935) and
Yule-Simon ' law ' ( Simon , 1955).
4 Analysis of Terminology 4 . 1 Random Permutation Unlike texts , the order of terms in a given terminological sample is basically arbitrary  . Thus term-level random permutation can be used to obtain the better descriptions of subsamples  . 
In the following , we use the results of 1000 term-level random permutations for the empirical descriptions of subsamples  . 
In fact , the results of the term-level and morpheme-level permutations almost coincide  , with no statistically significant difference . From this we can conclude that the binomial /Poisson assumption of the LNRE models in the previous section holds for the terminological data  . 
4.2 Quantitative Measures
Two measures are used for observing the dynamics of morphemes in terminology  . The first is the mean frequency of morphemes :

X(V ( N )) - V(N ) (5)
The repeated occurrence of a morpheme indicates that it is used as a constituent element of terms  , as the samples consist of term types . As it is not likely that the same morpheme occurs twice in a term  , the mean frequency indicates the average number of terms which is connected by a common morpheme  . 
A more important measure is the growth rate , P ( N) . If we observe E\[V ( N )\] for changing N , we obtain the growth curve of the morpheme types . The slope of the growth curve gives the growth rate  . By taking the first derivate of E\[V ( N ) \] given by equation ( 3 )  , therefore , we obtain the growth rate of the morpheme types : ~ NE\[  ( V ( 1 , g ) \] P ( N ) = E\[V ( N ) \] = N ( 6 ) This " expresses in a very real sense the probability that new types will be encountered when the  . . . sample is increased " ( Baayen , 1991) . 
For convenience , we introduce the notation for the complement of P ( N )   , the reuseratio :
R ( N ) = 1-P ( N )   ( 7 ) which expresses the probability that the existing types will be encountered  . 
For each type of morpheme , there are two ways of calculating P ( N ) . The first is on the basis of the total number of the running morphemes  ( frame sample )  . For the borrowed morphemes , for instance , it is defined as : PI~(N ) = E\[V ~ .   .   .   .   .   . a (1 , N ) \]/ N The second is on the basis of the number of running morphemes of each type  ( item sample )  . 
For instance , for the borrowed morphemes : Pib(N ) = E\[Vb .   .   .   .   .   . a(1,N)\]/Nb .   .   .   .   .   .   , i Correspondingly , the reuseratio R(N ) is also defined in two ways . 
Pi reflects the growth rate of the morphemes of each type observed separately  . Each of them expresses the probability of encountering a new morpheme for the separate sample consisting of the morphemes of the same type  , and does not in itself indicate any characteristics in the frame sample  . 

On the other hand , Pf and Rf express the quantitative status of the morphemes of each type as a mass in terminology  . So the transitions of Pf and Rf , with changing N , express the changes of the status of the morphemes of each type in the terminology  . In terminology , Pf can be interpreted as the probability of incorporating new conceptual elements  . 
4.3 Application of LNRE Models
Table 2 shows the results of the application of the LNRE models  , for the models whose mean square errors of V ( N ) and V ( 1 , N ) are minimal for 40 equally-spaced intervals of the sample . Figure 1 shows the growth curve of the morpheme types up to the original sample size  ( LNRE estimations by lines and the empirical values by dots  )  . According to Baayen (1993) , a good lognormal fit indicates high productivity , and the large Z of Yule-Simon model also means richness of the vocabulary  . Figure 1 and the chosen models in Table 2 confirm these interpretations .

The Applications of LNRE Models From Figure 1 , it is observed that the number of the borrowed morpheme types in computer science becomes bigger than that of the native morphemes around N =  15000  , while in psychology the number of the borrowed morphemes is much smaller within the given sample range  . All the elements are still growing , which implies that the quantitative measures keep changing  . 
Figure 2 shows the empirical and LNRE estimation of the spectrum elements  , for m = 1 to 10 . In both domains , the differences between V (1 , N ) and V(2 , N ) of the borrowed morphemes are bigger than those of the native morphemes  . 
Both the growth curves in Figure 1 and the distributions of the spectrum elements in Figure  2 show , at least to the eye , the reasonable fits of the LNRE models . In the discussions below , we assume that the LNRE based estimations are

4.3.1 Mean Frequency
As the population numbers of morphemes are estimated to be finite with the exception of the borrowed morphemes in psychology  , limN . _, oo X(V(N )) = o % which is not of much interest . The more important and interesting is the actual transition of the mean frequencies within a realistic range of N  , because the size of a terminology in practice is expected to be limited  . 
Figure 3 shows the transitions of X(V ( N)) , based on the LNRE models , up to 2N in computer science and 5N in psychology , plotted according to the size of the frame sample  . The mean frequencies are consistently higher in computer science than in psychology  .

N(a ) Computer Science 4 . 3  . 2 Growth Rate / Reuse Rat io Figure 4 shows the values of Pf , Pi and Rf , for the same range of N as in Figure 3 . The values of Pib(N ) and Pi , ( N ) in both domains show that , in general , the borrowed morphemes are more ' productive ' than the native morphemes  , though the actual value depends on the domain . 
Comparing the two domains by Pfau(N ) , we can observe that at the beginning the terminology of psychology relies more on the new morphemes than in computer science  , but the values are expected to become about the same around 
N--70000.
Pfs for the borrowed and native morphemes show interesting characteristics in each domain  . 
Firstly , in computer science , at the relatively early stage of terminological growth  ( i . e . N-~3500) , the borrowed morphemes begin to take the bigger ole in incorporating new conceptual elements  . Pfb ( N ) in psychology is expected to become bigger than \ [' In  ( N ) around N = 47000 . 
As the model estimates the population number of the borrowed morphemes to be infinite in psychology  , that the P fb ( N ) becomes bigger than Pfn ( N ) at some stage is logically expected . 
What is important here is that , even in psychology , where the overall role of the borrowed morphemes is marginal  , Pf = ( N ) is expected to become bigger around N--47000 , i . e . T~--2 1000 , which is well within the realistic value for a possible terminological size  .

5 Theoretical Validity 5 . 1 L ingu is t i c Va l id i ty We have seen that the LNRE models offer a useful means to observe the dynamics of morphemes  , beyond the sample size . As mentioned , what is important interminological nalyses is to obtain the patterns of transitions of some characteristic quantities beyond the sample size but still within the realistic range  , e . g . 2N , 3N , etc . Because we have been concerned with the morphemes a a mass  , we could safely use N instead of T to discuss the status of morphemes  , constituent morphemes in a term is stable . 
Among the measures we used in the analysis of morphemes  , the most important is the growth rate . The growth rate as the measure of the productivity of affixes  ( Baayen , 1991) was critically examined by van Marle (1991) . One of his essential points was the relation between the performance-based measure and the competence-based concept of productivity  . As the growth rate is by definition a performance -based measure  , it is not unnatural that the competence-based interpretation of the performance-based productivity measure is requested  , when the object of the analysis is directly related to such competence-oriented notion as derivation  . In terminology , however , this is not the case , because the notion of terminology is essentially performance-oriented  ( Kageura ,  1995) . The growth rate , which concerns with the linguistic performance , directly reflects the inherent nature of terminological structure  1  . 
One thing which may also have to be accounted for is the influence of the starting sample size  . Although we assumed that the order of terms in a given terminology is arbitrary  , it may ? not be the case , because usually a smaller sample may well include more'central'terms  . We may need further study concerning the status of the available terminological corpora  . 
5.2 Statistical Validity
Figure 5 plots the values of the z-score for E\[V\] and E \[V  ( 1 ) \] , for the models used in the analyses , at 20 equally-spaced intervals for the first half of the sample  2  . In psychology , all but one values are within the 95% confidence interval . 
In computer science , however , the fit is not so good as in psychology . 
Table 3 shows the X 2 values calculated on the basis of the first 15 spectrum elements at the original sample size . Unfortunately , the X 2 values show that the models have obtained the fits which are not ideal  , and the null hypothesis X Note however that the level of what is meant by the word ' performance ' is different  , as Baayen (1991) is text-oriented , while here it is vocabulary-oriented .

Table 3. X2 Values for the Models
Unlike texts ( Baayen , 1996a ; 1996b ) , the ill-fits of the growth curve of the models are not caused by the randomness assumption of the model  , because the results of the term-level permutations  , used for calculating z-scores , are statistically identical to the results of morpheme-level permutations  . This implies that we need better models if we pursue the better curve-fitting  . On the other hand , if we emphasise the theoretical assumption of the models of frequency distributions used in the LNRE analyses  , it is necessary to introduce the finer distinctions of morphemes  . 
6 Conclusions
Using the LNRE models , we have succesfully analysed the dynamic nature of the morphemes in Japanese terminology  . As the majority of the terminological data is located in the LNRE zone  , it is importantouse the statistical framework which allows for the LNRE characteristics  . 
The LNRE models give the suitable means.
We are currently extending our research to integrating the quantitative nature of morphological distributions to the qualitative mode \] of term formation  , by taking into account hepo-and the distributions of term length  .
