The paper describes two parsing schemes : a shallow approach based on machine learning and a cascaded finite-state parser with a handcrafted grammar  . It discusses several ways to combine them and presents evaluation results for the two individual approaches and their combination  . An underspecification scheme for the output of the finite-state parser is introduced and shown to improve performance  . 
1 Introduction
In several areas of Natural Language Processing , a combination of different approaches has been found to give the best results  . It is especially rewarding to combine deep and shallow systems  , where the former guarantees interpretability and high precision and the latter provides robustness and high recall  . 
This paper investigates such a combination consisting of an ngram based shallow parser and a cascaded finite-state  parser1 with handcrafted grammar and morphological checking  . The respective strengths and weaknesses of these approaches are brought to light in an indepth evaluation on a treebank of German newspaper texts  ( Skut et al , 1997) containing ca . 3 40,000 tokens in 19,546 sentences . 
The evaluation format chosen ( dependency tuples ) is used as the common denominator of the systems 1Although not everyone would agree that finite-state parsers constitute a ? deep ? approach to parsing  , they still are knowledge-based , require efforts of grammar-writing , a complex linguistic lexicon , manage without training data , etc . 
in building a hybrid parser with improved performance  . An underspecification scheme allows the finite -state parser partially ambiguous output  . It is shown that the other parser can in most cases successfully disambiguate such information  . 
Section 2 discusses the evaluation format adopted ( dependency structures )  , its advantages , but also some of its controversial points . Section 3 formulates a classification problem on the basis of the evaluation format and applies a machine learner to it  . Section 4 describes the architecture of the cascaded finite -state parser and its output in a novel underspecification format  . Section 5 explores several combination strategies and tests the monseveral variants of the two base components  . Section 6 provides an indepth evaluation of the component systems and the hybrid parser  . Section 7 concludes . 
2 Parser Evaluation
The simplest method to evaluate a parser is to count the parse trees it gets correct  . This measure is , however , not very informative since most applications do not require one hundred percent correct parse trees  . 
Thus , an important question in parser evaluation is how to break down parsing results  . 
In the PARSEVAL evaluation scheme ( Black et al . , 1991) , partially correct parses are gauged by the number of nodes they produce and have in common with the gold standard  ( measured in precision and recall )  . Another figure ( crossing brackets ) only counts those incorrect nodes that change the partial order induced by the tree  . A problematic aspect of the PARSEVAL approach is that the weight given to particular constructions is again grammar-specific  , since some grammars may need more nodes to describe them than others  . Further , the approach does not pay sufficient heed to the fact that parsing decisions are often intricately twisted : One wrong decision may produce a whole series of other wrong decisions  . 
Both these problems are circumvented when parsing results are evaluated on a more abstract level  , viz . dependency structure ( Lin , 1995) . 
Dependency structure generally follows predicate -argument structure  , but departs from it in that the basic building blocks are words rather than predicates  . In terms of parser evaluation , the first property guarantees independence of decisions  ( every link is relevant also for the interpretation level  )  , while the second property makes for a better empirical justification  . for evaluation units . Dependency structure can be modelled by a directed acylic graph  , with word tokens at the nodes . In labelled dependency structure , the links are furthermore classified into a certain set of grammatical roles  . 
Dependency can be easily determined from constituent structure if in every phrase structure rule a constituent is singled out as the head  ( Gaifman ,  1965) . To derive a labelled dependency structure , all nonhead constituents in a rule must be labelled with the grammatical role that links their head tokens to the head token of the head constituent  . 
There are two cases where the divergence between predicates and word tokens makes trouble :  ( 1 ) predicates expressed by more than one token , and ( 2 ) predicates expressed by no token ( as they occur in ellipsis )  . Case 1 frequently occurs within the verb complex ( of both English and German )  . The solution proposed in the literature ( Black et al , 1991; Lin , 1995; Carroll et al , 1998; K?bler and Telljohann ,  2002 ) is to define a normal form for dependency structure  , where every adjunct or argument attaches to some distinguished part of the verb complex  . The underlying assumption is that those cases where scope decisions in the verb complex are semantically relevant  ( e . g . with modal verbs ) are not resolvable in syntax anyway . There is no generally accepted solution for case 2   ( ellipsis )  . Most authors in the evaluation literature neglect it  , perhaps due to its infrequency ( in the NEGRA corpus , ellipsis only occurs in 1 . 2% of all dependency relations ) . 
Robinson (1970 ,  280 ) proposes to promote one of the dependents ( preferably an obligatory one )   ( 1a ) or even all dependents ( 1b ) to head status .

A more sweeping solution to these problems is to abandon dependency structure at all and directly go for predicate-argument structure  ( Carroll et al ,  1998) . But as we argued above , moving to a more theoretical level is detrimental to comparability across grammatical frameworks  . 
3 A Direct Approach : Learning
Dependency Structure
According to the dependency structure approach to evaluation  , the task of the parser is to find the correct dependency structure for a string  , i . e . to associate every word token with pairs of head token and grammatical role or else to designate it as independent  . To make the learning task easier , the number of classes should be reduced as much as possible  . For one , the task could be simplified by focusing on unlabelled dependency structure  ( measured in ? unlabelled ? precision and recall ( Eisner , 1996; Lin ,  1995)) , which is , however , in general not sufficient for further semantic processing  . 
3.1 Tree Property
Another possibility for reduction is to associate every word with at most one pair of head token and grammatical role  , i . e . to only look at dependency trees rather than graphs  . There is one case where the tree property cannot easily be maintained : coordination  . Conceptually , all the conjuncts are head constituents in coordination  , since the conjunction could be missing , and selectional restrictions work on the individual conjuncts  ( 2 )  . 
(2) Johnate ( fish and chips * wish and ships).
But if another word depends on the conjoined heads  ( see ( 4a ) ) , the tree property is violated . A way out of the dilemma is to select a specific conjunct as modification site  ( Lin , 1995; K?bler and Telljohann ,  2002) . But unless care is taken , semantically vital information is lost in the process : Example  ( 4 ) shows two readings which should be distinguished in dependency structure  . A comparison of the two readings shows that if either the first conjunct or the last conjunct is unconditionally selected certain readings become undistinguishable  . Rather , in order to distinguish a maximum number of readings  , premodifiers must attach to the last conjunct and postmodifiers and coordinating conjunctions to the first  conjunct2   . The fact that the modifier refers to a conjunction rather than to the conjunct is recorded in the grammatical role  ( by adding c to it )  . 
(4) a . the [ fans and supporters ] of Arsenal b . [ the fans ] and [ supporters of Arsenal ] Other constructions contradicting the tree property are arguably better treated in the lexicon anyway  ( e . g . control verbs ( Carroll et al ,  1998 ) ) or could be solved by enriching the repertory of grammatical roles  ( e . g . relative clauses with null relative pronouns could be treated by adding the dependency relation between head verb and missing element to the one between head verb and modified noun  )  . 
In a number of linguistic phenomena , dependency theorists disagree on which constituent should be chosen as the head  . A case in point are PPs . Few grammars distinguish between adjunct and subcategorized PPs at the level of prepositions  . In predicate-argument structure , however , the embedded NP is in one case related to the preposition  , in the other to the subcategorizing verb . Accordingly , some approaches take the preposition to be the head of a PP  ( Robinson , 1970; Lin ,  1995) , others the NP ( K?bler and Telljohann ,  2002) . Still other approaches ( Tes-ni?re , 1959; Carroll et al , 1998) conflate verb , preposition and head noun into a triple , and thus only count content words in the evaluation  . For learning , the matter can be resolved empirically : 2Even in this setting some readings cannot be distinguished  ( see e . g .   ( 3 ) where a conjunction of three modifiers would be retrieved  )  . Nevertheless , the proposed scheme fails in only 0 . 0017% of all dependency tuples . 
(3) In New York , we never meet , but in Boston.
Note that by this move we favor interpretability over projectivity  , but example (4a ) is nonprojective from the start . 
Taking prepositions as the head somewhat improves performance  , so we took PPs to be headed by prepositions . 
3.2 Encoding Head Tokens
Another question is how to encode the head token . The simplest method , encoding the word by its string position , generates a large space of classes . A more efficient approach uses the distance in string position between dependent and head token  . Finally , Lin ( 1995 ) proposes a third type of representation : In his work  , a head is described by its word type , an indication of the direction from the dependent  ( left or right ) and the number of tokens of the same type that lie between head and dependent  . An illustrative representation would be ? paper which refers to the second nearest token paper to the right of the current token  . Obviously there are far too many word tokens , but we can use Part-Of-Speech tags instead . 
Furthermore information on inflection and type of noun  ( proper versus common nouns ) is irrelevant , which cuts down the size even more . We will call this approach nth-tag . A further refinement of the nth-tag approach makes use of the fact that dependency structures areacy lic  . Hence , only those words with the same POS tag as the head between dependent and head must be counted that do not depend directly or indirectly on the dependent  . We will call this approach covered-nth-tag . 
pos distnth-tag cover labelled 1 , 924 1 , 3 49   982   921 unlabelled 97   119   162   157 Figure 1: Number of Classes in NEGRA Treebank Figure 1 shows the number of classes the individual approaches generate on the NEGRA Treebank  . 
Note that the longest sentence has 115 tokens ( with punctuation marks ) but that punctuation marks do not enter dependency structure  . The original treebank exhibits 31 nonhead syntactic3 grammatical roles . We added three roles for marker complements ( CMP )  , specifiers ( SPR ) , and floating quantifiers ( NK+) , and subtracted the roles for conjunction markers ( CP ) and coreference with expletive ( RE )  . 
3i . e . grammatical roles not merely used for tokenization  22 roles were copied to mark reference to conjunction  . Thus , all in all there was a stock of 54 grammatical roles . 
3.3 Experiments
We used  -grams ( 3grams and 5grams ) of POS tags as context and C4 . 5 ( Quinlan , 1993) for machine learning . All results were subjected to 10-fold crossvalidation . 
The learning algorithm always returns a result.
We counted a result as not assigned , however , if it referred to a head token outside the sentence  . See Figure 2 for results 4 of the learner . The left column shows performance with POS tags from the treebank  ( ideal tags , I-tags ) , the right column values obtained with POS tags as generated automatically by a tagger with an accuracy of  95%   ( tagger tags , T-tags ) .

Figure 2: Results for C4.5
The nth-taghead representation outperforms the distance representation by  10%  . Considering acyclicity ( cover ) slightly improves performance , but the gain is not statistically significant ( ttest with 99% )  . The results are quite impressive as they stand , in particular the nth-tag 5gram version seems to achieve quite good results . It should , however , be stressed that most of the dependencies correctly determined by the ngram methods extend over no more than  3 tokens . With the distance method , such ? short ? dependencies make up 98 . 90% of all dependencies correctly found , with the nth-tag method still 82% , but only 79 . 63% with the finite-state parser ( see section 4 ) and 78 . 91% in the treebank . 
4If the learner was given a chance to correct its errors  , i . e . 
if it could train on its training results in a second round  , there was a statistically significant gain in F -value with recall rising and precision falling  ( e . g . F-value . 7314, precision . 7397, recall . 7232 for nth-tag trigrams , and F-value . 7763, precision . 7826, recall . 7700 for nth-tag 5grams ) . 
4 Cascaded FiniteState Parser
In addition to the learning approach , we used a cascaded finite-state parser ( Schiehlen ,  2003) , to extract dependency structures from the text . The layout of this parser is similar to Abney?s parser  ( Abney , 1991): First , a series of transducers extracts noun chunks on the basis of tokenized and POS-tagged text  . Since center-embedding is frequent in German noun phrases  , the same transducer is used several times over . It also has access to inflectional information which is vital for checking agreement and determining case for subsequent phases  ( see ( Schiehlen , 2002) for a more thorough description ) . Second , a series of transducers extracts verb-final , verb-first , and verb-second clauses . In contrast to Abney , these are full clauses , not just simplex clause chunks , so that again recursion can occur . Third , the resulting parse tree is refined and decorated with grammatical roles  , using nondeterministic ? interpretation ? transducers  ( the same technique is used by Abney ( 1991 ) ) . Fourth , verb complexes are examined to find the head verb and auxiliary passive or raising verbs  . Only then subcategorization frames can be checked on the clause elements via a nondeterministic transducer  , giving them more specific grammatical roles if successful  . Fifth , dependency tuples are extracted from the parse tree  . 
4.1 Underspecification
Some parsing decisions are known to be not resolvable by grammar  . Such decisions are best handed over to subsequent modules equipped with the relevant knowledge  . Thus , in chart parsing , an underspecified representation is constructed , from which all possible analyses can be easily and efficiently read off  . Elworthy et al ( 2001 ) describe a cascaded parser which underspecifies PP attachment by allowing modifiers to be linked to several heads in a dependency tree  . Example (5) illustrates this scheme . 
(5) Is a waman in a car on the hill.
The main drawback of this scheme is its overgeneration  . In fact , it allows six readings for example (5) , which only has five readings ( the speaker could not have been in the car , if the man was asserted to be on the hill ) . A similar clause with 10 PPs at the end would receive 39  , 916 , 800 readings rather than 58 , 786 . So a more elaborate scheme is called for , but one that is just as easy to generate . 
A device that often comes in handy for underspecification are context variables  ( Maxwell III and Kaplan , 1989; D?rre ,  1997) . First let us give every sequence of prepositional phrases in every clause a specific name  ( e . g . 1B for the second sequence in the first clause ) . Now we generate the ambiguous dependency relations  ( like ( Elworthy et al , 2001)) but label them with context variables . Such context variables consist of the sequence name    , a number  designating the dependent in left-to -right order  ( e . g . 0 for in , 1 for on in example (5)) , and a number  designating the head in left-to -right  ( e . g . 
0 for saw , 1 forman , 2 for hill in (5)) . If the links are stored with the dependents , the number  can be left implicit . Generation of such a representation is straightforward and  , in particular , does not lead to a higher class of complexity of the full system  . Example ( 6 ) shows a tuple representation for the two prepositions of sentence  ( 5 )  . 
(6) in [1A00] saw ADJ , [1A01]man ADJ on [1A10] saw ADJ , [1A11]man ADJ , [1A12] car ADJ In general , a dependent  can modify   heads , viz . the heads numbered  . Now we put the following constraint on resolution : A dependent  can only modify a head   if no previous dependent  which could have attached to    ( i . e . 
      ) chose some head  to the left of  rather than     . The condition is formally expressed in (7) . In example ( 6 ) there are only two dependents (  ffin ,  fi  flon) . If in attaches to saw , on cannot attach to a head between saw and in ; conversely if on attaches to man , in cannot attach to a head before man . Nothing follows if on attaches to car . 
(7 ) Constraint : ffi    !"$ # % & #' ( * ) + fi & # )  ,  -    .  0/ for all PP sequences   The cascaded parser described adopts this underspecification scheme for right modification  . Left modification ( see ( 8 ) ) is usually not stacked so the simpler scheme of Elworthy et al  ( 2001 ) suffices . 
(8) They are usually competent people.
German is a free word order language , so that subcategorization can be ambiguous . Such ambiguities should also be underspecified . Again we introduce a context variable   for every ambiguous subcategorization frame  ( e . g . 1 in ( 9 ) ) and count the individual readings 1 ( with letters a , bin(9)) .

Since subcategorization ambiguity interacts with attachment ambiguity  , context variables sometimes need to be coupled : In example  ( 10 ) the attachment ambiguity only occurs if the PP is read as adjunct  .

In evaluating underspecified representations , Riezler et al ( 2002 ) distinguish upper and lower bound , standing for optimal performance in disambiguation and average performance  , respectively . In

Figure 3 , values are also given for the performance of the parser without underspecification  , i . e . always favoring maximal attachment and word order without scrambling  ( direct )  . Interestingly this method performs significantly better than average  , an effect mainly due to the preference for high attachment  . 
5 Combining the Parsers
We considered several strategies to combine the results of the diverse parsing approaches : simple voting  , weighted voting , Bayesian learning , Maximum Entropy , and greedy optimization of F-value . 
Simple Voting . The result predicted by the majority of base classifiers is chosen  . The finite-state parser , which may give more than one result , distributes its vote evenly on the possible readings  . 
Weighted Voting . In weighted voting , the result which gets the most votes is chosen , where the number of votes given to a base classifier is correlated with its performance on a training set  . 
Bayesian Learning . The Bayesian approach of Xu et al ( 1992 ) chooses the most probable prediction . The probability of a prediction   is computed by the product     / of the probability of   given the predictions   made by the individual base classifiers  . The probability     / of a correct prediction    given a learned prediction    is approximated by relative frequency in a training set  . 
Maximum Entropy . Combining the results can also be seen as a classification task  , with base predictions added to the original set of features  . We used the Maximum Entropy approach 5 ( Berger et al . , 1996) as a machine learner for this task . Un-derspecified features were assigned multiple values  . 
Greedy Optimization of F-value . Another method uses a decision list of prediction ? classifier pairs to choose a prediction by a classifier  . The list is obtained by greedy optimization : In each step  , the prediction ? classifier pair whose addition results in the highest gain in F-value for the combined model on the training set is appended to the list  . 
The algorithm terminates when F-value cannot be improved by any of the remaining candidates  . A finer distinction is possible if the decision is made dependent on the POS tag as well  . For greedy optimization , the predictions of the finite-state parser were classified only in grammatical roles  , not head positions . We used 10-fold crossvalidation to determine the decision lists . 
5 More specifically , the OpenNLP implementation ( http://maxent . sourceforge . net / ) was used with 10 iterations and a cutoff frequency for features of  10  .

Figure 4: Combination Strategies
We tested the various combination strategies for the combination FiniteState parser  ( lower bound ) and C4 . 55 gramnth-tag on ideal tags ( results in Figure 4 )  . Both simple and weighted voting degrade the results of the base classifiers  . Greedy optimization outperforms all other strategies  . Indeed it comes near the best possible choice which would give an Fscore of  . 9089 for 5gramnth-tag and finite-state parser ( upper bound )   ( cf . Figure 5) .

All combinations listed yield an improvement of more than  1% in F-value over the base classifiers . 
It is striking that combination with a shallow parser does not help the FiniteState parser much in coverage  ( upper bound )  , but that it helps both in disambiguation ( pushing up the lower bound to almost the level of upper bound  ) and robustness ( remedying at least some of the errors )  . The benefit of underspecification is visible when lower bound and direct are compared  . The nth-tag 5gram method was the best method to combine the finite -state parser with  . Even on T-tags , this combination achieved an Fscore of . 8520 ( lower , upper: . 8579, direct: . 8329) without POS tag and an Fscore of . 8563 ( lower , upper: . 8642, direct: . 8535) with POS tags . 
6 In-Depth Evaluation
Figure 6 gives a survey of the performance of the parsing approaches relative to grammatical role  . 
These figures are more informative than overall Fscore  ( Preiss ,  2003) . The first column gives the name of the grammatical role  , as explained below . 
The second column shows corpus frequency in percent  . The third column gives the standard deviation of distance between dependent and head  . The three last columns give the performance ( recall ) of C4 . 5 with distance representation and 5grams , C4 . 5 with nth-tag representation and 5grams , and the cascaded finite-state parser , respectively . For the finite-state parser , the number shows performance with optimal disambiguation  ( upper bound ) and , if the grammatical role allows underspecification  , the number for average disambiguation ( lower bound ) in parentheses . 
Relations between function words and content words  ( e . g . specifier ( SPR ) , marker complement ( CMP ) , infinitival zu marker ( PM ) ) are frequent and easy for all approaches . The cascaded parser has an edge over the learners with arguments  ( subject ( SB )  , clausal ( OC ) , accusative ( OA ) , second accusative ( OA2) , genitive ( OG ) , dative object ( DA )) . For all these argument roles a slight amount of ambiguity persists  ( as can be seen from the divergence between upper and lower bound  )  , which is due to free word order . No ambiguity is found with reported speech ( RS ) . The cascaded parser also performs quite well where verb complexes are concerned  ( separable verb prefix ( SVP )  , governed verbs ( OC ) , and predicative complements ( PD , SP )) . Another clearly discernible complex are adjuncts ( modifier ( MO )  , negation ( NG ) , passive subject ( SBP ) ; one-place coordination ( J Unctor ) and discourse markers ( DM )  ; finally postnominal modifier ( MNR ) , genitive ( GR ) , or von-phrase ( PG )) , which all exhibit attachment ambiguities . No attachment ambiguities are attested for prenominal genitives  ( GL )  . Some types of adjunction have not yet been implemented in the cascaded parser  , so that it performs badly on them ( e . g . relative clauses ( RC ) , which are usually extraposed to the right ( average distance is -11 . 6) and thus quite difficult also for the learners ; comparative constructions ( CC , CM ) , measure phrases ( AMS ) , floating quantifiers ( NK+)) . Attachment ambiguities also occur with appositions  ( APP , NK6) . Notoriously difficult is coordination ( attach-role freq dev distnth-tFS-parser

7 Conclusion
The paper has presented two approaches to German parsing  ( ngram based machine learning and cascaded finite -state parsing  )  , and evaluated them on the basis of a large amount of data  . A new representation format has been introduced that allows underspecification of select types of syntactic ambiguity  ( attachment and subcategorization ) even in the absence of a fullfledged chart . Several methods have been discussed for combining the two approaches  . 
It has been shown that while combination with the shallow approach can only marginally improve performance of the cascaded parser if ideal disambiguation is assumed  , a quite substantial rise is registered in situations closer to the realworld where POS tagging is deficient and resolution of attachment and subcategorization ambiguities less than perfect  . 
In ongoing work , we look at integrating a statistic contextfree parser called BitPar  , which was written by Helmut Schmid and achieves . 816 Fscore on NEGRA . Interestingly , the performance goes up to . 9 474 Fscore when BitPar is combined with the FS parser  ( upper bound ) and . 9443 for the lower bound . 
So at least for German , combining parsers seems to be a pretty good idea . Thanks are due to Helmut Schmid and Prof . C . Rohrer for discussions , and to the reviewers for their detailed comments .
