Abstract
In this paper , we dedicate to the topic of aspect ranking , which aims to automatically identify important product aspects from online consumer reviews . The important aspects are identified according to two observations : ( a ) the important aspects of a product are usually commented by a large number of consumers ; and ( b ) consumers ? opinions on the important aspects greatly influence their overall opinions on the product . In particular , given consumer reviews of a product , we first identify the product aspects by a shallow dependency parser and determine consumers ? opinions on these aspects via a sentiment classifier . We then develop an aspect ranking algorithm to identify the important aspects by simultaneously considering the aspect frequency and the influence of consumers ? opinions given to each aspect on their overall opinions . The experimental results on 11 popular products in four domains demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach . We further apply the aspect ranking results to the application of document-level sentiment classification , and improve the performance significantly.
1 Introduction
The rapidly expanding e-commerce has facilitated consumers to purchase products online . More than $156 million online product retail sales have been done in the US market during 2009 ( Forrester Research , 2009). Most retail Web sites encourage consumers to write reviews to express their opinions on various aspects of the products . This gives rise to Figure 1: Sample reviews on iPhone 3GS product huge collections of consumer reviews on the Web.
These reviews have become an important resource for both consumers and firms . Consumers commonly seek quality information from online consumer reviews prior to purchasing a product , while many firms use online consumer reviews as an important resource in their product development , marketing , and consumer relationship management . As illustrated in Figure 1, most online reviews express consumers ? overall opinion ratings on the product , and their opinions on multiple aspects of the product . While a product may have hundreds of aspects , we argue that some aspects are more important than the others and have greater influence on consumers ? purchase decisions as well as firms ? product development strategies . Take iPhone 3GS as an example , some aspects like ? battery ? and ? speed ,? are more important than the others like ? moisture sensor .? Generally , identifying the important product aspects will benefit both consumers and firms . Consumers can conveniently make wise purchase decision by paying attentions on the important aspects , while firms can focus on improving the quality of tion effectively . However , it is impractical for people to identify the important aspects from the numerous reviews manually . Thus , it becomes a compelling need to automatically identify the important aspects from consumer reviews.
A straightforward solution for important aspect identification is to select the aspects that are frequently commented in consumer reviews as the important ones . However , consumers ? opinions on the frequent aspects may not influence their overall opinions on the product , and thus not influence consumers ? purchase decisions . For example , most consumers frequently criticize the bad ? signal connection ? of iPhone 4, but they may still give high overall ratings to iPhone 4. On the other hand , some aspects , such as ? design ? and ? speed ,? may not be frequently commented , but usually more important than ? signal connection .? Hence , the frequency-based solution is not able to identify the truly important aspects.
Motivated by the above observations , in this paper , we propose an effective approach to automatically identify the important product aspects from consumer reviews . Our assumption is that the important aspects of a product should be the aspects that are frequently commented by consumers , and consumers ? opinions on the important aspects greatly influence their overall opinions on the product . Given the online consumer reviews of a specific product , we first identify the aspects in the reviews using a shallow dependency parser ( Wu et al , 2009), and determine consumers ? opinions on these aspects via a sentiment classifier . We then design an aspect ranking algorithm to identify the important aspects by simultaneously taking into account the aspect frequency and the influence of consumers ? opinions given to each aspect on their overall opinions . Specifically , we assume that consumer?s overall opinion rating on a product is generated based on a weighted sum of his/her specific opinions on multiple aspects of the product , where the weights essentially measure the degree of importance of the aspects . A probabilistic regression algorithm is then developed to derive these importance weights by leveraging the aspect frequency and the consistency between the overall opinions and the weighted sum of opinions on various aspects . We conduct experiments on 11 popular products in four domains.
The consumer reviews on these products are crawled from the prevalent forum Web sites ( e.g ., cnet.com and viewpoint.com etc .) More details of our review corpus are discussed in Section 3. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on important aspects identification . Furthermore , we apply the aspect ranking results to the application of document-level sentiment classification by carrying out the term-weighting based on the aspect importance . The results show that our approach can improve the performance significantly.
The main contributions of this paper include , 1) We dedicate to the topic of aspect ranking , which aims to automatically identify important aspects of a product from consumer reviews.
2) We develop an aspect ranking algorithm to identify the important aspects by simultaneously considering the aspect frequency and the influence of consumers ? opinions given to each aspect on their overall opinions.
3) We apply aspect ranking results to the application of document-level sentiment classification , and improve the performance significantly.
There is another work named aspect ranking ( Snyder et al , 2007). The task in this work is different from ours . This work mainly focuses on predicting opinionated ratings on aspects rather than identifying important aspects.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows . Section 2 elaborates our aspect ranking approach . Section 3 presents the experimental results , while Section 4 introduces the application of document-level sentiment classification . Section 5 reviews related work and Section 6 concludes this paper with future works.
2 Aspect Ranking Framework
In this section , we first present some notations and then elaborate the key components of our approach , including the aspect identification , sentiment classification , and aspect ranking algorithm.
2.1 Notations and Problem Formulation
Let R = { r1, ? ? ? , r|R |} denotes a set of online consumer reviews of a specific product . Each review r ? R is associated with an overall opinion rating ments on these aspects . Suppose there arem aspects A = { a1, ? ? ? , am } involved in the review corpus R , where ak is the kth aspect . We define ork as the opinion on aspect ak in review r . We assume that the overall opinion rating Or is generated based on a weighted sum of the opinions on specific aspects ork ( Wang et al , 2010). The weights are denoted as {? rk}mk=1, each of which essentially measures the degree of importance of the aspect ak in review r.
Our task is to derive the important weights of aspects , and identify the important aspects.
Next , we will introduce the key components of our approach , including aspect identification that identifies the aspects ak in each review r , aspect sentiment classification which determines consumers ? opinions ork on various aspects , and aspect ranking algorithm that identifies the important aspects.
2.2 Aspect Identification
As illustrated in Figure 1, there are usually two types of reviews , Pros and Cons review and free text reviews on the Web . For Pros and Cons reviews , the aspects are identified as the frequent noun terms in the reviews , since the aspects are usually noun or noun phrases ( Liu , 2009), and it has been shown that simply extracting the frequent noun terms from the Pros and Cons reviews can get high accurate aspect terms ( Liu el al ., 2005). To identify the aspects in free text reviews , we first parse each review using the Stanford parser 1, and extract the noun phrases ( NP ) from the parsing tree as aspect candidates . While these candidates may contain much noise , we leverage the Pros and Cons reviews to assist identify aspects from the candidates . In particular , we explore the frequent noun terms in Pros and Cons reviews as features , and train a one-class SVM ( Manevitz et al , 2002) to identify aspects in the candidates . While the obtained aspects may contain some synonym terms , such as ? earphone ? and ? headphone ,? we further perform synonym clustering to get unique aspects . Specifically , we first expand each aspect term with its synonym terms obtained from the synonym terms Web site 2, and then cluster the terms to obtain unique aspects based on 1http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/lex-parser.shtml 2http://thesaurus.com unigram feature.
2.3 Aspect Sentiment Classification
Since the Pros and Cons reviews explicitly express positive and negative opinions on the aspects , respectively , our task is to determine the opinions in free text reviews . To this end , we here utilize Pros andCons reviews to train a SVM sentiment classifier.
Specifically , we collect sentiment terms in the Pros and Cons reviews as features and represent each review into feature vector using Boolean weighting.
Note that we select sentiment terms as those appear in the sentiment lexicon provided by MPQA project ( Wilson et al , 2005). With these features , we then train a SVM classifier based on Pros and Cons reviews . Given a free text review , since it may cover various opinions on multiple aspects , we first locate the opinionated expression modifying each aspect , and determine the opinion on the aspect using the learned SVM classifier . In particular , since the opinionated expression on each aspect tends to contain sentiment terms and appear closely to the aspect ( Hu and Liu , 2004), we select the expressions which contain sentiment terms and are at the distance of less than 5 from the aspect NP in the parsing tree.
2.4 Aspect Ranking
Generally , consumer?s opinion on each specific aspect in the review influences his/her overall opinion on the product . Thus , we assume that the consumer gives the overall opinion rating Or based on the weighted sum of his/her opinion ork on each aspect ak : ? m k=1 ? rkork , which can be rewritten as ? rTor , where?r and or are the weight and opinion vectors . Inspired by the work of Wang et al (2010), we viewOr as a sample drawn from aGaussian Distribution , with mean ? rTor and variance ?2, p(Or ) = 1? 2??2 exp[?(Or ? ? r
Tor)2 2?2 ]. (1)
To model the uncertainty of the importance weights ? r in each review , we assume ? r as a sample drawn from a Multivariate Gaussian Distribution , with ? as the mean vector and ? as the covariance matrix , p(?r ) =
T??1(?r ? ?)].
(2) knowledge to define the distribution of ? and ?.
Specifically , the distribution of ? and ? is defined based on its KullbackLeibler ( KL ) divergence to a prior distribution with a mean vector?0 and an identity covariance matrix I in Eq.3. Each element in?0 is defined as the frequency of the corresponding aspect : frequency(ak )/ ? m i=1 frequency(ai).
p (?,?) = exp [?? ? KL(Q(?,?)||Q(?0, I ))], (3) where KL (?, ?) is the KL divergence , Q (?,?) denotes a Multivariate Gaussian Distribution , and ? is a tradeoff parameter.
Base on the above definition , the probability of generating the overall opinion rating Or on review r is given as , p(Or |?, r ) = ? p(Or|?rTor , ?2) ? p(?r |?,?) ? p(?,?)d?r , (4) where ? = {?,?,?, ?2} are the model parameters.
Next , we utilize Maximum Log-likelihood ( ML ) to estimate the model parameters given the consumer reviews corpus . In particular , we aim to find an optimal ?? to maximize the probability of observing the overall opinion ratings in the reviews corpus.
?? = argmax ? ? r?R log(p(Or |?, r )) = argmin ? (| R | ? 1) log det (?) + ? r?R [ log ?2+ ( Or??rTor)2 ?2 + (? r ? ?)
T??1(?r ? ?)]+ ( tr (?) + (?0 ? ?) TI(?0 ? ?)).
(5)
For the sake of simplicity , we denote the objective function ? r?R log(p(Or |?, r )) as ?(?).
The derivative of the objective function with respect to each model parameter vanishes at the minimizer : ??(?) ?? r = ? (? rTor?Or)or ?2 ?? ?1(?r ? ?) = 0; (6) ??(?) ?? = ? r?R [???1(?r ? ?)]? ? ? I(?0 ? ?) = 0; (7) ??(?) ?? = ? r?R {?(??1)T ? [?(??1)T (? r ? ?) (? r ? ?) T (??1)T ]}+ ? ? [ (??1)T ? I ] = 0; (8) ??(?) ??2 = ? r?R (? 1?2 + ( Or??rTor)2 ?4 ) = 0, (9) which lead to the following solutions : ?? r = ( oror
T ?2 +? ?1)?1(Oror?2 +? ?1?); (10) ?? = (| R|??1 + ? ? I)?1(??1 ? r?R ? r + ? ? I?0); (11) ?? = {[ 1? ? r?R [ (? r ? ?)(? r ? ?) T ] + ( | R|??2? ) 2I]1/2 ? (| R|??)2? I}
T ; (12) ??2 = 1|R | ? r?R ( Or ? ? rTor)2.
(13)
We can see that the above parameters are involved in each other?s solution . We here utilize Alternating Optimization technique to derive the optimal parameters in an iterative manner . We first hold the parameters ?, ? and ?2 fixed and update the parameters ? r for each review r ? R . Then , we update the parameters ?, ? and ?2 with fixed ? r ( r ? R).
These two steps are alternatively iterated until the Eq.5 converges . As a result , we obtain the optimal importance weights ? r which measure the importance of aspects in review r ? R . We then compute the final importance score ? k for each aspect ak by integrating its importance score in all the reviews as , ? k = ? r?R ? rk , k = 1, ? ? ? , m (14) It is worth noting that the aspect frequency is considered again in this integration process . According to the importance score ? k , we can identify important aspects.
3 Evaluations
In this section , we evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on aspect identification , sentiment classification , and aspect ranking.
3.1 Data and Experimental Setting
The details of our product review data set is given in Table 1. This data set contains consumer reviews on 11 popular products in 4 domains . These reviews were crawled from the prevalent forum Web sites , including cnet.com , viewpoints.com , reevoo.com and gsmarena.com . All of the reviews were posted the reviews , as well as the opinions on the aspects were manually annotated as the gold standard for evaluations.

Table 1: Statistics of the Data Sets , # denotes the size of the reviews/sentences.
To examine the performance on aspect identification and sentiment classification , we employed F1-measure , which was the combination of precision and recall , as the evaluation metric . To evaluate the performance on aspect ranking , we adopted Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain at top k ( NDCG@k ) ( Jarvelin and Kekalainen , 2002) as the performance metric . Given an aspect ranking list a1, ? ? ? , ak , NDCG@k is calculated by
NDCG@k = 1
Z k ? i=1 2t(i ) ? 1 log(1 + i ) , (15) where t(i ) is the function that represents the reward given to the aspect at position i , Z is a normalization term derived from the top k aspects of a perfect ranking , so as to normalize NDCG@k to be within [0, 1]. This evaluation metric will favor the ranking which ranks the most important aspects at the top.
For the reward t(i ), we labeled each aspect as one of the three scores : Unimportant ( score 1), Ordinary ( score 2) and Important ( score 3). Three volunteers were invited in the annotation process as follows.
We first collected the top k aspects in all the rankings produced by various evaluated methods ( maximum k is 15 in our experiment ). We then sampled some reviews covering these aspects , and provided the reviews to each annotator to read . Each review contains the overall opinion rating , the highlighted aspects , and opinion terms . Afterward , the annotators were required to assign an importance score to each aspect . Finally , we took the average of their scorings as the corresponding importance scores of the aspects . In addition , there is only one parameter ? that needs to be tuned in our approach . Throughout the experiments , we empirically set ? as 0.001.
3.2 Evaluations on Aspect Identification We compared our aspect identification approach against two baselines : a ) the method proposed by Hu and Liu (2004), which was based on the association rule mining , and b ) the method proposed by Wu et al (2009), which was based on a dependency parser.
The results are presented in Table 2. On average , our approach significantly outperforms Hu?s method and Wu ? method in terms of F1-measure by over 5.87% and 3.27%, respectively . In particular , our approach obtains high precision . Such results imply that our approach can accurately identify the aspects from consumer reviews by leveraging the Pros and
Cons reviews.

3.3 Evaluations on Sentiment Classification In this experiment , we implemented the following sentiment classification methods ( Pang and Lee , 2008): 1) Unsupervised method . We employed one unsupervised method which was based on opinionated term counting via SentiWordNet ( Ohana et al , 2009).
2) Supervised method . We employed three supervised methods proposed in Pang et al (2002), including Na??ve Bayes ( NB ), Maximum Entropy ( ME ), SVM . These classifiers were trained based on the Pros and Cons reviews as described in Section 2.3.

The comparison results are showed in Table 3. We can see that supervised methods significantly outperform unsupervised method . For example , the SVM classifier outperforms the unsupervised method in terms of average F1-measure by over 10.37%. Thus , we can deduce from such results that the Pros and Cons reviews are useful for sentiment classification.
In addition , among the supervised classifiers , SVM classifier performs the best in most products , which is consistent with the previous research ( Pang et al , 2002).

3.4 Evaluations on Aspect Ranking
In this section , we compared our aspect ranking algorithm against the following three methods.
1) Frequency-based method . The method ranks the aspects based on aspect frequency.
2) Correlation-based method . This method measures the correlation between the opinions on specific aspects and the overall opinion . It counts the number of the cases when such two kinds of opinions are consistent , and ranks the aspects based on the number of the consistent cases.
3) Hybrid method . This method captures both the aspect frequency and correlation by a linear combination , as ?? Frequency-based Ranking + (1 ? ?)? Correlation-based Ranking , where ? is set to 0.5.
The comparison results are showed in Table 4. On average , our approach outperforms the frequency-based method , correlation-based method , and hybrid method in terms of NDCG@5 by over 6.24%, 5.79% and 5.56%, respectively . It improves the performance over such three methods in terms of NDCG@10 by over 3.47%, 2.94% and 2.58%, respectively , while in terms of NDCG@15 by over 4.08%, 3.04% and 3.49%, respectively . We can deduce from the results that our aspect ranking algorithm can effectively identify the important aspects from consumer reviews by leveraging the aspect frequency and the influence of consumers ? opinions given to each aspect on their overall opinions . Table 5 shows the aspect ranking results of these four methods . Due to the space limitation , we here only show top 10 aspects of the product iphone 3GS . We can see that our approach performs better than the others . For example , the aspect ? phone ? is ranked at the top by the other methods . However , ? phone ? is a general but not important aspect.

To further investigate the reasonability of our ranking results , we refer to one of the public user feedback reports , the ? china unicom 100 customers iPhone user feedback report ? ( Chinaunicom Report , 2009). The report demonstrates that the top four aspects of iPhone product , which users most concern with , are ?3G Network ? (30%), ? usability ? (30%), ? out-looking design ? (26%), ? application ? (15%).
All of these aspects are in the top 10 of our ranking results.
Therefore , we can conclude that our approach is able to automatically identify the important aspects from numerous consumer reviews.

provide product comparison on the important aspects to users , so that users can make wise purchase decisions conveniently.
In the following , we apply the aspect ranking results to assist document-level review sentiment classification . Generally , a review document contains consumer?s positive/negative opinions on various aspects of the product . It is difficult to get the accurate overall opinion of the whole review without knowing the importance of these aspects . In addition , when we learn a document-level sentiment classifier , the features generated from unimportant aspects lack of discriminability and thus may deteriorate the performance of the classifier ( Fang et al , 2010). While the important aspects and the sentiment terms on these aspects can greatly influence the overall opinions of the review , they are highly likely to be discriminative features for sentiment classification . These observations motivate us to utilize aspect ranking results to assist classifying the sentiment of review documents.
Specifically , we randomly sampled 100 reviews of each product as the testing data and used the remaining reviews as the training data . We first utilized our approach to identify the importance aspects from the training data . We then explored the aspect terms and sentiment terms as features , based on which each review is represented as a feature vector . Here , we give more emphasis on the important aspects and the sentiment terms that modify these aspects . In particular , we set the term-weighting as 1 + ? ?? k , where ? k is the importance score of the aspect ak , ? is set to 100. Based on the weighted features , we then trained a SVM classifier using the training reviews to determine the overall opinions on the testing reviews . For the performance comparison , we compared our approach against two baselines , including Boolean weighting method and frequency weighting ( tf ) method ( Paltoglou et al , 2010) that do not utilize the importance of aspects . The comparison results are shown in Table 6. We can see that our approach ( IA ) significantly outperforms the other methods in terms of average F1-measure by over 2.79% and 4.07%, respectively . The results also show that the Boolean weighting method outperforms the frequency weighting method in terms of average F1-measure by over 1.25%, which are consistent with the previous research by Pang et al (2002). On the other hand , from the IA weighting formula , we observe that without using the important aspects , our term-weighting function will be equal to Boolean weighting . Thus , we can speculate that the identification of important aspects is beneficial to improving the performance of document-level sentiment classification.

Earlier research had been studied unsupervised ( Kim et al ., 2004), supervised ( Pang et al , 2002; Pang et al , 2005) and semisupervised approaches ( Goldberg et al ., 2006) for the classification . For example , Mullen et al (2004) proposed an unsupervised classification method which exploited pointwise mutual information ( PMI ) with syntactic relations and other attributes . Pang et al (2002) explored several machine learning classifiers , including Na??ve Bayes , Maximum Entropy , SVM , for sentiment classification . Goldberg et al (2006) classified the sentiment of the review using the graphbased semisupervised learning techniques , while Li el al . (2009) tackled the problem using matrix factorization techniques with lexical prior knowledge.
Since the consumer reviews usually expressed opinions on multiple aspects , some works had drilled down to the aspect-level sentiment analysis , which aimed to identify the aspects from the reviews and to determine the opinions on the specific aspects instead of the overall opinion . For the topic of aspect identification , Hu and Liu (2004) presented the association mining method to extract the frequent terms as the aspects . Subsequently , Popescu et al (2005) proposed their system OPINE , which extracted the aspects based on the KnowItAll Web information extraction system ( Etzioni et al , 2005). Liu el al.
(2005) proposed a supervised method based on language pattern mining to identify the aspects in the reviews . Later , Mei et al (2007) proposed a probabilistic topic model to capture the mixture of aspects and sentiments simultaneously . Afterwards , Wu et al (2009) utilized the dependency parser to extract the noun phrases and verb phrases from the reviews as the aspect candidates . They then trained a language model to refine the candidate set , and to obtain the aspects . On the other hand , for the topic of sentiment classification on the specific aspect , Snyder et al (2007) considered the situation when the consumers ? opinions on one aspect could influence their opinions on others . They thus built a graph to analyze the metarelations between opinions , such as agreement and contrast . And they proposed a Good Grief algorithm to leveraging such metarelations to improve the prediction accuracy of aspect opinion ratings . In addition , Wang et al (2010) proposed the topic of latent aspect rating which aimed to infer the opinion rating on the aspect . They first employed a bootstrapping-based algorithm to identify the major aspects via a few seed word aspects . They then proposed a generative Latent Rating Regression model ( LRR ) to infer aspect opinion ratings based on the review content and the associated overall rating.
While there were usually huge collection of reviews , some works had concerned the topic of aspect-based sentiment summarization to combat the information overload . They aimed to summarize all the reviews and integrate major opinions on various aspects for a given product . For example , Titov et al (2008) explored a topic modeling method to generate a summary based on multiple aspects.
They utilized topics to describe aspects and incor-opinion ratings . Additionally , Lu el al . (2009) proposed a structured PLSA method , which modeled the dependency structure of terms , to extract the aspects in the reviews . They then aggregated opinions on each specific aspects and selected representative text segment to generate a summary.
In addition , some works proposed the topic of product ranking which aimed to identify the best products for each specific aspect ( Zhang et al , 2010). They used a PageRank style algorithm to mine the aspect-opinion graph , and to rank the products for each aspect.
Different from previous researches , we dedicate our work to identifying the important aspects from the consumer reviews of a specific product.
6 Conclusions and Future Works
In this paper , we have proposed to identify the important aspects of a product from online consumer reviews . Our assumption is that the important aspects of a product should be the aspects that are frequently commented by consumers and consumers ? opinions on the important aspects greatly influence their overall opinions on the product . Based on this assumption , we have developed an aspect ranking algorithm to identify the important aspects by simultaneously considering the aspect frequency and the influence of consumers ? opinions given to each aspect on their overall opinions . We have conducted experiments on 11 popular products in four domains . Experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach on important aspects identification . We have further applied the aspect ranking results to the application of document-level sentiment classification , and have significantly improved the classification performance . In the future , we will apply our approach to support other applications.
