In this paper we will present three systems , ATLAS , THAM and VISULEX , which have been designed and implemented at GETA ( Study Group for Machine Translation ) in collaboration with IFCI ( Institut de Formation et de Conseilen Informatique  ) as tools operating around the ARIANE-78 system . We will describe in turn the basic characteristics of each system  , their possibilities , actual use , and performance . 
I-INTRODUCTION
A RIANE-T8 is a computer system designed to offer an adequate environment for constructing machine translation programs  , for running them , and for ( humanly ) revising the rough translations produced by the computer  . It has been used for a number of applications ( Russian and Japanese , English to French and Malay , Portuguese to English ) and has been constantly been amended to meet the needs of the users \[ Ch  . BOITET et al , 1982\] . In this paper , we will present three software tools for this environment which have been requested by the systemts users  . 
II-ATLAS
ATLAS is an Kid to the linguist for introducing new words and their associated codes into a coded dictionary of a Computer Aided Translation  ( CAT ) application . 
Previously , linguists used indexing manuals when adding new words to dictionaries  . These manuals contained indexing charts , sorts of graphs enabling the search for the linguistic code associated with a given lexical unit in a particular linguistic application  . The choice of one path in a chart is the result of successive choices made at each node  . This may be represented by associating questions to each node and the possible answers to the arcs coming from a node  ; the leaves of the tree bear the name of the code and an example  . 
A language to write the " indexing charts " is provided to the linguist  . An ATLAS session begins with an optional compilation phase  . Then , the system functions in a conversational way in order to execute commands  . 
The main functions of ATLAS are the following : - Editing and updating of indexing charts : compilation of an external form of the chart  , and modification of the internal form through interaction with the user  , with the possibility of returning a new external form  . 
-Interpretation of these charts , in order to obtain the linguistic codes and the indexing of dictionaries  . A chart is interpreted like a menu , so that the user can traverse the charts answering the questions  . He can also view the code found , or any other code , by request , and examine and update the dictionary by writing the code in the correct field of the current record  . 
-Visualisation of charts in a treelike form in order to build the indexing manuals  . 
In the case of interpretation , the screen is handling as a whole by the system : it manages several fields such as the dictionary field  , the chart field and the command field . 
The system is written in PASCAL , with a small routine in assembler for screen -handling  . 
Below , we give two examples : - The first is a piece of tree built by the system based on an indexing chart  . 
-The second is a screen such as the user sees it in the interpretation phase  .

III-THAM
Computers can help translators in several ways , particularly with Machine Aided Human Translation  ( MAHT )  . The translator is provided with a text editing system  , as well as an uncoded dictionary which may be directly accessed on the screen  . But the translation is always done by the translator  . 
THAM consists of a set of functions programmed in the macro language associated with a powerful text editor  . These functions help the translator and improve his effeciency  . 
The conventional translation of a text is generally performed in several stages  , often by different people : a rough translation followed by one or several revisions : linguistic revision  , " postediting " , or " technical revision " . Hence , the THAM system works with four types of objects : source text  ( S )  , translated text ( T ) , revised text ( R ) and uncoded dictionary(D ) . In the actual system , each of these objects corresponds to one " file " . 
The file S contains the original text to be translated  , the file T contains the rough translation resulting from a mechanical translation or a first unrevised human translation  . 
The uncoded dictionary is composed of a sorted list of records following a fairly simple syntax  . 
The access key is a character string followed by the record content  , on one or several lines , in a free format . In general , the " content " gives one or several equivalents , but it can also contain definitions , examples , and equivalents in several languages : it is totally free  ( and uncontrolled )  . 
Finally , the file R is the final translation of the original text realized by the user from the three previous files  . 
THAM is designed for display terminals . It can simultaneously display one , two , three or four files , in the order desired by the user . The screen is divided into variable horizontal windows  . The user can consult the dictionary with an arbitrary character string  ( which may be extracted from one of the working files  )  , update the dictionary , insert into the revision file a part of another file  , make permutations or transpositions of several parts of a file  , and receive suggestions for the translation of a word displayed in a window  . Moreover , the system can simultaneously use many source , translation , dictionary or revision files . 
Basic ideas for THAM come from various sources such as IBM's DTAF system  ( only used inhouse on a limited scale ) and \[ A . MELBY's TWS982\] . Initial experiments have shown this tool to be quite useful  . 
IV-VISULEX
VISULEX is a handy and easy-to-use visualisation tool designed to reassemble and clearly distinguish certain information contained in a linguistic application database  . VISULEX is intended to facilitate the comprehension and development of coded dictionaries which may be hindered by two factors : the dispersal of information and the obscurity of the coding  . In ARIANE-78 , the lexical database may reside on much more 50 files , for a given pair of language . 
This database is composed of dictionaries , " formats " and " procedures " of the analysis , transfer and synthesis phases ( the 3 conventional phases of a CAT system )  . For any given source lexical unit in this data base  , VISULEX searches for all the associated information  . 
VISULEX offers two levels of detail . At the first level , the information is presented by using only the comments associated with the codes found  . 
At the second level , a parallel listing is produced , with the codes themselves , and their symbolic definition . The first level output can be considered as the kernel of an " uncoded dictionar ~ The system provides  , on one or several output units , a formated output , with these different visualisation levels . 
This system can be considered to have several possible uses : - as a documentation tool for linguistic applications  ; -as a debugging tool for linguistic applications  ; - asatool for converting the lexical base into a new form  ( for instance , loading it into a conventional database ) . 
It is possible to imagine VISULEX results being used as a pedagogical introduction to a CAT application  , seeing that the output form is more comprehensible than the original form  . 
For the Russian-French application , VISULEX output gives two listings of around 150 , O00 lines each . This makes it a lot easier to detect indexing errors  , at all levels . This is a first step towards improved " lexical knowledge processing "  . 
Finally , we give an example of a VISULEX output . The chosen lexical unit is " CHANGE " in the English-French pedagogical prototype application  . 
The two levels are showed ( the left column correspond to the first level , the right column to the second ) .

V-CONCLUSION
These software tools have been designed to be easily adaptable to different dialogue languages  ( multilinguism )   . The development method used is conventionals tructured  , modular and descending programming . Altogether the design , programming , documentation and complete testing represent a round two man/years of work  . The size of the total source code is a round  5   , 000 PASCAL lines and 4 , 500 EXEC2/XEDIT lines , comments included . 
The ARIANE-78 system extended by ATLAS , THAM and VlSULEX is more comfortable and more homogeneous for the user to work with  . This is the first version , and we already have many ideas provided by the users and our own experience for improving these systems  .
