Abstract
Most previous graphbased parsing models increase decoding complexity when they use high-order features due to exact-inference decoding . In this paper , we present an approach to enriching high-order feature representations for graphbased dependency parsing models using a dependency language model and beam search . The dependency language model is built on a large-amount of additional auto-parsed data that is processed by a baseline parser . Based on the dependency language model , we represent a set of features for the parsing model . Finally , the features are efficiently integrated into the parsing model during decoding using beam search . Our approach has two advantages . Firstly we utilize rich high-order features defined over a view of large scope and additional large raw corpus . Secondly our approach does not increase the decoding complexity . We evaluate the proposed approach on English and Chinese data.
The experimental results show that our new parser achieves the best accuracy on the Chinese data and comparable accuracy with the best known systems on the English data.
1 Introduction
In recent years , there are many datadriven models that have been proposed for dependency parsing ( McDonald and Nivre , 2007). Among them , graphbased dependency parsing models have achieved state-of-the-art performance for a wide range of languages as shown in recent CoNLL shared tasks ? Corresponding author ( Buchholz and Marsi , 2006; Nivre et al , 2007).
In the graphbased models , dependency parsing is treated as a structured prediction problem in which the graphs are usually represented as factored structures . The information of the factored structures decides the features that the models can utilize . There are several previous studies that exploit high-order features that lead to significant improvements.
McDonald et al (2005) and Covington (2001) develop models that represent first-order features over a single arc in graphs . By extending the first-order model , McDonald and Pereira (2006) and Carreras (2007) exploit second-order features over two adjacent arcs in second-order models . Koo and Collins (2010) further propose a third-order model that uses third-order features . These models utilize higher-order feature representations and achieve better performance than the first-order models . But this achievement is at the cost of the higher decoding complexity , from O(n2) to O(n4), where n is the length of the input sentence . Thus , it is very hard to develop higher-order models further in this way.
How to enrich high-order feature representations without increasing the decoding complexity for graphbased models becomes a very challenging problem in the dependency parsing task . In this paper , we solve this issue by enriching the feature representations for a graphbased model using a dependency language model ( DLM ) ( Shen et al , 2008).
The Ngram DLM has the ability to predict the next child based on the N1 immediate previous children and their head ( Shen et al , 2008). The basic idea behind is that we use the DLM to evaluate whether a valid dependency tree ( McDonald and Nivre , 2007) ing model searches for the final dependency trees by considering the original scores and the scores of
DLM.
In our approach , the DLM is built on a large amount of auto-parsed data , which is processed by an original first-order parser ( McDonald et al , 2005). We represent the features based on the DLM.
The DLM-based features can capture the Ngram information of the parent-children structures for the parsing model . Then , they are integrated directly in the decoding algorithms using beamsearch . Our new parsing model can utilize rich high-order feature representations but without increasing the complexity.
To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach , we conduct experiments on English and Chinese data . The results indicate that the approach greatly improves the accuracy . In summary , we make the following contributions : ? We utilize the dependency language model to enhance the graphbased parsing model . The DLM-based features are integrated directly into the beamsearch decoder.
? The new parsing model uses the rich high-order features defined over a view of large scope and and additional large raw corpus , but without increasing the decoding complexity.
? Our parser achieves the best accuracy on the Chinese data and comparable accuracy with the best known systems on the English data.
2 Dependency language model
Language models play a very important role for statistical machine translation ( SMT ). The standard Ngram based language model predicts the next word based on the N?1 immediate previous words . However , the traditional Ngram language model can not capture long-distance word relations . To overcome this problem , Shen et al (2008) proposed a dependency language model ( DLM ) to exploit long-distance word relations for SMT . The Ngram DLM predicts the next child of a head based on the N ? 1 immediate previous children and the head itself . In this paper , we define a DLM , which is similar to the one of Shen et al (2008), to score entire dependency trees.
An input sentence is denoted by x = ( x0, x1, ..., xi , ..., xn ), where x0 = ROOT and does not depend on any other token in x and each token xi refers to a word . Let y be a dependency tree for x and H(y ) be a set that includes the words that have at least one dependent . For each xh ? H(y ), we have a dependency structure Dh = ( xLk , ... xL1, xh , xR1...xRm ), where xLk , ... xL1 are the children on the left side from the farthest to the nearest and xR1...xRm are the children on the right side from the nearest to the farthest . Probability
P ( Dh ) is defined as follows:
P ( Dh ) = PL(Dh )? PR(Dh ) (1)
Here PL and PR are left and right side generative probabilities respectively . Suppose , we use a Ngram dependency language model . PL is defined as follows:
PL(Dh ) ? PLc(xL1|xh ) ? PLc(xL2|xL1, xh ) ?... (2) ? PLc(xLk|xL(k?1), ..., xL(k?N+1), xh ) where the approximation is based on the nth order Markov assumption . The right side probability is similar . For a dependency tree , we calculate the probability as follows:
P ( y ) = ? xh?H(y)
P ( Dh ) (3)
In this paper , we use a linear model to calculate the scores for the parsing models ( defined in Section 3.1). Accordingly , we reform Equation 3. We define fDLM as a highdimensional feature representation which is based on arbitrary features of PLc , PRc and x . Then , the DLM score of tree y is in turn computed as the inner product of fDLM with a corresponding weight vector wDLM .
scoreDLM ( y ) = fDLM ? wDLM (4) 3 Parsing with dependency language model In this section , we propose a parsing model which includes the dependency language model by extending the model of McDonald et al (2005).
214 3.1 Graphbased parsing model
The graphbased parsing model aims to search for the maximum spanning tree ( MST ) in a graph ( McDonald et al , 2005). We write ( xi , xj ) ? y if there is a dependency in tree y from word xi to word xj ( xi is the head and xj is the dependent ). A graph , denoted by Gx , consists of a set of nodes Vx = { x0, x1, ..., xi , ..., xn } and a set of arcs ( edges ) Ex = {( xi , xj)|i 6= j , xi ? Vx , xj ? ( Vx ? x0)}, where the nodes in Vx are the words in x . Let T ( Gx ) be the set of all the subgraphs of Gx that are valid dependency trees ( McDonald and
Nivre , 2007) for sentence x.
The formulation defines the score of a dependency tree y ? T ( Gx ) to be the sum of the edge scores , s(x , y ) = ? g?y score(w , x , g ) (5) where g is a spanning subgraph of y . g can be a single dependency or adjacent dependencies . Then y is represented as a set of factors . The model scores each factor using a weight vector w that contains the weights for the features to be learned during training using the Margin Infused Relaxed Algorithm ( MIRA ) ( Crammer and Singer , 2003; McDonald and Pereira , 2006). The scoring function is score(w , x , g ) = f(x , g ) ? w (6) where f(x , g ) is a highdimensional feature representation which is based on arbitrary features of g and x.
The parsing model finds a maximum spanning tree ( MST ), which is the highest scoring tree in T ( Gx ). The task of the decoding algorithm for a given sentence x is to find y ?, y ? = argmax y?T ( Gx ) s(x , y ) = argmax y?T ( Gx ) ? g?y score(w , x , g ) 3.2 Add DLM scores In our approach , we consider the scores of the DLM when searching for the maximum spanning tree.
Then for a given sentence x , we find y?DLM , y?DLM = argmax y?T ( Gx ) ( ? g?y score(w , x , g)+scoreDLM ( y )) After adding the DLM scores , the new parsing model can capture richer information . Figure 1 illustrates the changes . In the original first-order parsing model , we only utilize the information of single arc ( xh , xL(k?1)) for xL(k?1) as shown in Figure 1-(a).
If we use 3gram DLM , we can utilize the additional information of the two previous children ( nearer to xh than xL(k?1)): xL(k?2) and xL(k?3) as shown in
Figure 1-(b).
Figure 1: Adding the DLM scores to the parsing model 3.3 DLM-based feature templates
We define DLM-based features for Dh = ( xLk , ... xL1, xh , xR1...xRm ). For each child xch on the left side , we have PLc(xch|HIS ), where HIS refers to the N ? 1 immediate previous right children and head xh . Similarly , we have PRc(xch|HIS ) for each child on the right side . Let Pu(xch|HIS ) ( Pu(ch ) in short ) be one of the above probabilities.
We use the map function ?( Pu(ch )) to obtain the predefined discrete value ( defined in Section 5.3).
The feature templates are outlined in Table 1, where TYPE refers to one of the types:PL or PR , h pos refers to the part-of-speech tag of xh , h word refers to the lexical form of xh , ch pos refers to the part-of-speech tag of xch , and ch word refers to the lexical form of xch.
4 Decoding
In this section , we turn to the problem of adding the DLM in the decoding algorithm . We propose two ways : (1) Rescoring , in which we rescore the K-best list with the DLM-based features ; (2) Intersect , < ?( Pu(ch)),TYPE , h pos > < ?( Pu(ch)),TYPE , h word > < ?( Pu(ch)),TYPE , ch pos > < ?( Pu(ch)),TYPE , ch word > < ?( Pu(ch)),TYPE , h pos , ch pos > < ?( Pu(ch)),TYPE , h word , ch word >
Table 1: DLM-based feature templates in which we add the DLM-based features in the decoding algorithm directly.
4.1 Rescoring
We add the DLM-based features into the decoding procedure by using the rescoring technique used in ( Shen et al , 2008). We can use an original parser to produce the K-best list . This method has the potential to be very fast . However , because the performance of this method is restricted to the K-best list , we may have to set K to a high number in order to find the best parsing tree ( with DLM ) or a tree acceptably close to the best ( Shen et al , 2008).
4.2 Intersect
Then , we add the DLM-based features in the decoding algorithm directly . The DLM-based features are generated online during decoding.
For our parser , we use the decoding algorithm of McDonald et al (2005). The algorithm was extensions of the parsing algorithm of ( Eisner , 1996), which was a modified version of the CKY chart parsing algorithm . Here , we describe how to add the DLM-based features in the first-order algorithm.
The second-order and higher-order algorithms can be extended by the similar way.
The parsing algorithm independently parses the left and right dependents of a word and combines them later . There are two types of chart items ( McDonald and Pereira , 2006): 1) a complete item in which the words are unable to accept more dependents in a certain direction ; and 2) an incomplete item in which the words can accept more dependents in a certain direction . In the algorithm , we create both types of chart items with two directions for all the word pairs in a given sentence . The direction of a dependency is from the head to the dependent . The right ( left ) direction indicates the dependent is on the right ( left ) side of the head . Larger chart items are created from pairs of smaller ones in a bottom-up style . In the following figures , complete items are represented by triangles and incomplete items are represented by trapezoids . Figure 2 illustrates the cubic parsing actions of the algorithm ( Eisner , 1996) in the right direction , where s , r , and t refer to the start and end indices of the chart items . In Figure 2-(a ), all the items on the left side are complete and the algorithm creates the incomplete item ( trapezoid on the right side ) of s ? t . This action builds a dependency relation from s to t . In Figure 2-(b ), the item of s ? r is incomplete and the item of r ? t is complete . Then the algorithm creates the complete item of s ? t . In this action , all the children of r are generated . In Figure 2, the longer vertical edge in a triangle or a trapezoid corresponds to the subroot of the structure ( spanning chart ). For example , s is the subroot of the span s ? t in Figure 2-(a ). For the left direction case , the actions are similar.
Figure 2: Cubic parsing actions of Eisner ( Eisner , 1996) Then , we add the DLM-based features into the parsing actions . Because the parsing algorithm is in the bottom-up style , the nearer children are generated earlier than the farther ones of the same head.
Thus , we calculate the left or right side probability for a new child when a new dependency relation is built . For Figure 2-(a ), we add the features of PRc(xt|HIS ). Figure 3 shows the structure , where cRs refers to the current children ( nearer than xt ) of xs . In the figure , HIS includes cRs and xs.
Figure 3: Add DLM-based features in cubic parsing overall best score as the final parse , where K spans are built at each step ( Zhang and Clark , 2008). At each step , we perform the parsing actions in the current beam and then choose the best K resulting spans for the next step . The time complexity of the new decoding algorithm is O(Kn3) while the original one is O(n3), where n is the length of the input sentence.
With the rich feature set in Table 1, the running time of Intersect is longer than the time of Rescoring . But Intersect considers more combination of spans with the DLM-based features than Rescoring that is only given a K-best list.
5 Implementation Details 5.1 Baseline parser We implement our parsers based on the MSTParser1, a freely available implementation of the graphbased model proposed by ( McDonald and Pereira , 2006).
We train a first-order parser on the training data ( described in Section 6.1) with the features defined in McDonald et al (2005). We call this first-order parser Baseline parser.
5.2 Build dependency language models
We use a large amount of unannotated data to build the dependency language model . We first perform word segmentation ( if needed ) and part-of-speech tagging . After that , we obtain the word-segmented sentences with the part-of-speech tags . Then the sentences are parsed by the Baseline parser . Finally , we obtain the auto-parsed data.
Given the dependency trees , we estimate the probability distribution by relative frequency:
Pu(xch|HIS ) = count(xch,HIS ) ? x?ch count(x?ch,HIS ) (7) No smoothing is performed because we use the mapping function for the feature representations.
5.3 Mapping function
We can define different mapping functions for the feature representations . Here , we use a simple way.
First , the probabilities are sorted in decreasing order.
Let No(Pu(ch )) be the position number of Pu(ch ) in the sorted list . The mapping function is : 1http://mstparser.sourceforge.net ?( Pu(ch )) = { PH if No(Pu(ch )) ? TOP10
PM if TOP10 < No(Pu(ch )) ? TOP30
PL if TOP30 < No(Pu(ch))
PO if Pu(ch )) = 0 where TOP10 and TOP 30 refer to the position numbers of top 10% and top 30% respectively . The numbers , 10% and 30%, are tuned on the development sets in the experiments.
6 Experiments
We conducted experiments on English and Chinese data.
6.1 Data sets
For English , we used the Penn Treebank ( Marcus et al ., 1993) in our experiments . We created a standard data split : sections 221 for training , section 22 for development , and section 23 for testing . Tool ? Penn2Malt?2 was used to convert the data into dependency structures using a standard set of head rules ( Yamada and Matsumoto , 2003). Following the work of ( Koo et al , 2008), we used the MXPOST ( Ratnaparkhi , 1996) tagger trained on training data to provide part-of-speech tags for the development and the test set , and used 10-way jackknifing to generate part-of-speech tags for the training set.
For the unannotated data , we used the BLLIP corpus ( Charniak et al , 2000) that contains about 43 million words of WSJ text.3 We used the MXPOST tagger trained on training data to assign part-of-speech tags and used the Baseline parser to process the sentences of the BLLIP corpus.
For Chinese , we used the Chinese Treebank ( CTB ) version 4.04 in the experiments . We also used the ? Penn2Malt ? tool to convert the data and created a data split : files 1270 and files 400-931 for training , files 271-300 for testing , and files 301-325 for development . We used gold standard segmentation and part-of-speech tags in the CTB . The data partition and part-of-speech settings were chosen to match previous work ( Chen et al , 2008; Yu et al , 2008; Chen et al , 2009). For the unannotated data , we used the XIN CMN portion of Chinese Giga-word5 Version 2.0 ( LDC2009T14) ( Huang , 2009), 2http://w3.msi.vxu.se/?nivre/research/Penn2Malt.html 3We ensured that the text used for extracting subtrees did not include the sentences of the Penn Treebank.
4http://www.cis.upenn.edu/?chinese/.
5We excluded the sentences of the CTB data from the Gigaword data segmentation and POS tags are given . We discarded the annotations due to the differences in annotation policy between CTB and this corpus . We used the MMA system ( Kruengkrai et al , 2009) trained on the training data to perform word segmentation and POS tagging and used the Baseline parser to parse all the sentences in the data.
6.2 Features for basic and enhanced parsers The previous studies have defined four types of features : ( FT1) the first-order features defined in McDonald et al (2005), ( FT2SB ) the second-order parent-siblings features defined in McDonald and Pereira (2006), ( FT2GC ) the second-order parent-child-grandchild features defined in Carreras (2007), and ( FT3) the third-order features defined in ( Koo and Collins , 2010).
We used the first - and second-order parsers of the MSTParser as the basic parsers . Then we enhanced them with other higher-order features using beamsearch . Table 2 shows the feature settings of the systems , where MST1/2 refers to the basic first-/second-order parser and MSTB1/2 refers to the enhanced first-/second-order parser . MSTB1 and MSTB2 used the same feature setting , but used different order models . This resulted in the difference of using FT2SB ( beamsearch in MSTB1 vs exact-inference in MSTB2). We used these four parsers as the Baselines in the experiments.

Table 2: Baseline parsers
We measured the parser quality by the unlabeled attachment score ( UAS ), i.e ., the percentage of tokens ( excluding all punctuation tokens ) with the correct HEAD . In the following experiments , we used ? Inter ? to refer to the parser with Intersect , and ? Rescore ? to refer to the parser with Rescoring.
6.3 Development experiments
Since the setting of K ( for beam search ) affects our parsers , we studied its influence on the development set for English . We added the DLM-based features to MST1. Figure 4 shows the UAS curves on the development set , where K is beam size for Intersect and K-best for Rescoring , the X-axis represents K , and the Y-axis represents the UAS scores . The parsing performance generally increased as the K increased . The parser with Intersect always outperformed the one with Rescoring.

Table 3: The parsing times on the development set ( seconds for all the sentences ) Table 3 shows the parsing times of Intersect on the development set for English . By comparing the curves of Figure 4, we can see that , while using larger K reduced the parsing speed , it improved the performance of our parsers . In the rest of the experiments , we set K=8 in order to obtain the high accuracy with reasonable speed and used Intersect to add the DLM-based features.

Table 4: Effect of different Ngram DLMs Then , we studied the effect of adding different Ngram DLMs to MST1. Table 4 shows the results.
From the table , we found that the parsing performance roughly increased as the N increased . When N=3 and N=4, the parsers obtained the same scores for English . For Chinese , the parser obtained the best score when N=4. Note that the size of the Chinese unannotated data was larger than that of English . In the rest of the experiments , we used 3gram for English and 4gram for Chinese.
218 6.4 Main results on English data
We evaluated the systems on the testing data for English . The results are shown in Table 5, where - DLM refers to adding the DLM-based features to the Baselines . The parsers using the DLM-based features consistently outperformed the Baselines . For the basic models ( MST1/2), we obtained absolute improvements of 0.94 and 0.63 points respectively.
For the enhanced models ( MSTB1/2), we found that there were 0.63 and 0.66 points improvements respectively . The improvements were significant in McNemar?s Test ( p < 10?5)(Nivre et al , 2004).

Table 5: Main results for English 6.5 Main results on Chinese data The results are shown in Table 6, where the abbreviations used are the same as those in Table 5. As in the English experiments , the parsers using the DLM-based features consistently outperformed the Baselines . For the basic models ( MST1/2), we obtained absolute improvements of 4.28 and 3.51 points respectively . For the enhanced models ( MSTB1/2), we got 3.00 and 2.93 points improvements respectively . We obtained large improvements on the Chinese data . The reasons may be that we use the very large amount of data and 4gram DLM that captures high-order information . The improvements were significant in McNemar?s Test ( p < 10?7).

Zhou et al (2011).
The results showed that our MSTB-DLM2 obtained the comparable accuracy with the previous state-of-the-art systems . Koo10-model1 ( Koo and Collins , 2010) used the third-order features and achieved the best reported result among the supervised parsers . Suzuki2009 ( Suzuki et al , 2009) reported the best reported result by combining a Semisupervised Structured Conditional Model ( Suzuki and Isozaki , 2008) with the method of ( Koo et al , 2008). However , their decoding complexities were higher than ours and we believe that the performance of our parser can be further enhanced by integrating their methods with our parser.

Table 8: Relevant results for Chinese 7 Analysis Dependency parsers tend to perform worse on heads which have many children . Here , we studied the effect of DLM-based features for this structure . We calculated the number of children for each head and listed the accuracy changes for different numbers.
We compared the MST-DLM1 and MST1 systems on the English data . The accuracy is the percentage of heads having all the correct children.
Figure 5 shows the results for English , where the X-axis represents the number of children , the Y-axis represents the accuracies , OURS refers to MST-DLM1, and Baseline refers to MST1. For example , for heads having two children , Baseline obtained 89.04% accuracy while OURS obtained 89.32%.
From the figure , we found that OURS achieved better performance consistently in all cases and when the larger the number of children became , the more significant the performance improvement was.

Koo et al (2008) used a clustering algorithm to produce word clusters on a large amount of unannotated data and represented new features based on the clusters for dependency parsing models . Chen et al (2009) proposed an approach that extracted partial tree structures from a large amount of data and used them as the additional features to improve dependency parsing . They approaches were still restricted in a small number of arcs in the graphs . Suzuki et al (2009) presented a semisupervised learning approach . They extended a Semisupervised Structured Conditional Model ( SS-SCM)(Suzuki and Isozaki , 2008) to the dependency parsing problem and combined their method with the approach of Koo et al (2008). In future work , we may consider apply their methods on our parsers to improve further.
Another group of methods are the co-training/self-training techniques . McClosky et al . (2006) presented a self-training approach for phrase structure parsing . Sagae and Tsujii (2007) used the cotraining technique to improve performance . First , two parsers were used to parse the sentences in unannotated data . Then they selected some sentences which have the same trees produced by those two parsers . They retrained a parser on newly parsed sentences and the original labeled data . We are able to use the output of our systems for co-training/self-training techniques.
9 Conclusion
We have presented an approach to utilizing the dependency language model to improve graphbased dependency parsing . We represent new features based on the dependency language model and integrate them in the decoding algorithm directly using beamsearch . Our approach enriches the feature representations but without increasing the decoding complexity . When tested on both English and Chinese data , our parsers provided very competitive performance compared with the best systems on the English data and achieved the best performance on the
Chinese data in the literature.
