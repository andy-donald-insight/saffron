Since Kimball ( 73 ) parsing preference principles such as " Right association "  ( RA ) and " Minimal attachment " ( MA ) are often formulated with respect to constituent trees  . We present 3 preference principles based on " derivation trees " within the framework of LTAGs  . We argue they remedy some shortcomings of the former approaches and account for widely accepted heuristics  ( e . g . 
argument/modifier , idioms ...).

The inherent characteristics of LTAGs ( i.e.
lexicalization , adjunction , an extende domain of locality and " mildly -context sensitive " power  ) makes it attractive to Natural Language Processing : LTAGs are parsable in polynomial time and allow an elegant and psycholinguistically plausible representation of natural language  1  . Large coverage grammars were developed for English  ( X taggroup ( 95 ) ) and French ( Abeille ( 91 ) ) . Unfortunately , " large " grammars yield high ambiguity rates : Doran & al  . (94) report 7 . 4 6 parses/sentence on a WSJ corpus of 18730 sentences using a wide coverage English grammar . Srinivas & al .   ( 95 ) formulate domain independent heuristics to rank parses  . 
But this approach is practical , English-oriented , not explicitly linked to psycholinguistic results  , and does not fully exploit " derivation " ie . g . Frank ( 92 ) discusses the psycholinguistic relevance of adjunction for Children Language Acquisition  , Joshi ( 90 ) discusses psycholinguistic results on crossed and serial dependencies  . 
information . In this paper , we present 3 disambiguation principles which exploit derivation trees  . 
1, Brief presentation of LTAGs
ALTAG consists of a finite set of elementary trees of finite depth  . Each elementary tree must << anchor > > one or more lexical item  ( s )  . The principal anchor is called dae a d > > , other anchors are called < < co-heads > > . All leaves in elementary trees are either < < anchor > >  , < < footnode > > ( noted * ) or < < substitution node > > ( noted $ )  . These trees are of 2 types ? auxiliary or initial 2  . A tree has at most 1 foot node , such a tree is an auxiliary tree . Trees that are not auxiliary are initial . Elementary trees combine with 2 operations : substitution and adjunetion . 
Substitution is compulsory and is used essentially for arguments  ( subject , verb and noun complements ) . It consists in replacing in a tree ( elementary or not ) a node marked for substitution with an initial tree that has a root of same category  . Adjunction is optional ( although it can be forbidden or made compulsory using specific constraints  ) and deals essentially with determiners , modifiers , auxiliaries , modals , raising verbs ( e . g . seem ) . It consists in inserting in a tree in place of a node X an auxiliary tree with a root of same category  . The descendants of X then become the descendants of the foot node of the auxiliary tree  . Contrary to contextfree rewriting rules , the history of derivation must be made explicit since the same derived tree can be obtained using different derivations  . This is why parsing LTAGs yields a derivation tree  , from 2Traditionally initial trees are called o ~ , and auxiliary trees 13 obtained . ( Figure 1) 3 . Branches in a derivation tree are unordered . 
Moreover , linguistic constraints on the wellformedness of elementary trees have been formulated : ? Predicate Argument Cooccurence Principle : there must be a leaf node for each realized argument of the head of an elementary tree  . 
? Semantic on sistency : No elementary tree is semantically void ? Semantic minimality : an elementary tree corresponds at most o one semantic unit  2  . Former results on parsing preferences A vast literature addresses parsing preferences  . 
Structural approaches introduced 2 principles : RA accounts for the preferred reading of the ambiguou sentence  ( a ) : " yesterday " attaches to " left " and not to " said "  ( Kimball ( 73 ) ) . 
MA accounts for the preferred reading of ( b ) :" for Sue " attaches to " bought " and not to " flowers "  ( Frazier & Fodor ( 78 ) )  ( a ) Tom said that Joeleft yesterday ( b ) Tom bough the flowers for Sue These structural principles have been criticized though : Among other things  , the interaction between these principles is unclear  . This type of approach lacks provision for integration with semantics and/or pragmatics  ( Schubert ( 84 ) ) , does not clearly establish the distinction between arguments and modifiers  ( Ferreira & Clifton ( 86 ) ) and is English-biased : evidence against RA has been found for Spanish  ( Cuetos & Mitchell ( 88 ) ) and Dutch ( Brysbaert & Mitchell ( 96 ) ) . 
Some parsing preferences are widely accepted , though : The idiomatic interpretation of a sentence is favored over its literal interpretation  ( Gibbs &
Nayak (89)).
Arguments are preferred over modifiers ( Abney ( 89 )  , Britt & al .  (92)) . 
Additionally , lexical factors ( e . g . frequency of subcategorization for a given verb ) have been shown to influence parsing preferences ( I-Iindle &
Rooth (93)).
It is striking that these three most consensual types of syntactic preferences tumout to be difficult to formalize by resorting only to " constituent trees "  , but easy to formalize in terms of LTAGs . 
Before explaining our approach , we must underline that the examples 4 presented later on are not necessarily counterexamples to RA and or MA  , but just illustrations : our goal is not to further criticize RA and MA  , but to show that problems linked to these " traditional " structural approaches do not automatically condemn all structural approaches  . 
3 Three preference principles based on derivation trees For sake of brevity  , we will not develop the importance of " lexical factors "  , but just note that LTAGs are obviously well suited to represent that type of preferences because of strong lexicalization  5  . 
To account for the " idiomatic " vs " literal " , and for the " argument " vs " modifier " preferences  , we formulate three parsing preference principles based on the shape of derivation trees :  1  . Prefer the derivation tree with the fewer number of nodes  2  . Prefer to attach an m-tree low 63 . Prefer the derivation tree with the fewer number of  13-tree nodes Principle 1 takes precedence over principle 2 and principle 2 takes precedence over principle 3  . 
3 Our examples follow linguistic analyses presented in  ( Abeill 6 ( 91 ) ) , excep that we substitute sential complements when no extraction occurs  . Thus we use no VP node and no Whn or NP traces . But this has no incidence on the application of our preference principles  . 
4 These examples are kept simple on purpose , for sake of clarity . 
Also , " lexical preferences " and " structural preferences " are not necessarily antagonistic and can both be used for practical purpose  . 
6 By low we mean " as far as possible from the root "  . 
586 3 . 1 What these principles account for Principle 1 accounts for the preference " idiomatic " over " literal ": In LTAGs  , all the set elements of an idiomatic expression are present masingle elementary tree  . Figure 1 shows the 2 derivation trees obtained when parsing " Yesterday John kicked the bucket "  . The preferred one ( i . e . idiomatic interpretation ) has fewer nodes .

A human picked one or more " correct " derivations for each sentence parsed  8  . Principle 1 , and then Principles 1  &  2 were applied on the derivation trees to eliminate some derivations  . 
Table 1 shows the results obtained.

TABLE 1: results for TSNLP 4 . 1 Comments on the results ARer disambiguating with principles  1 and 2  , the proportion of sentences with at least one parse judged correct by a human only marginally decreased while the average number of parses per s More than one derivation was deemed " correct " when nonspurious ambiguity remained in modifier attachment  ( e . g . He saw the man with a telescope ) sentence went down from 2 . 85 to 2 . 17 ( i . e .  -24 %) . 
Since " strict modifier attachment " is orthogonal to our concem  , a sentence such as ( f ) still yields 5 derivations , partly because of spurious ambiguity , partly because of adverbial attachment ( i . e . ' qaier " attached to Sorto V ) .

For sentences that are affected by at least one of these two principles  , the average number of parses per sentence goes down from  6  . 76 to 2 . 94 after applying both principles ( i . e .  - 56 . 5 %) . ( Table 2) .

TABLE 2 : Results for sentences affected by at least one Principle  4  . 2 The gap between theory and practice Surprisingly  , Principle 1 was used in only one case to prefer an idiomatic interpretation  , but proved very useful in preferring arguments over modifiers : derivation trees with arguments often have fewer nodes because of co-heads  . For instance it systematically favored the attachment of " by " phrases as passive with agent  , Principle 2 favored lower attachment of arguments as in ( g ) but proved useful only in conjunction with Principle  1 : it provided further disambiguation by selecting derivation trees among those with an equally low number of nodes  . 

Principle 2 says to attach an argument low ( e.g.
to the direct object of them are verb ) rather than high ( e . g . to the verb ) . In ( el ) , " of the demonstration " attaches to " organizer " rather than to " suspect "  , while m ( c2 ) " of the crime " can only attach to the verb . Figure 2 shows how principle 2 yields the prefer rederivation tree for sentence ( cl )  . Similarly , in sentence ( dl ) " to whom " attaches to " say " rather than to " give "  , while in ( d2 ) it attaches to " give " since " think " cannot take a PP complement  . This agrees with psycholinguistic results such as " filled gap effects "  ( Cram & Fodor ( 85 ) ) . 
( cl ) John suspects the organizer of the demonstration ( c2 ) John suspects Bill of the crime ( dl ) To whom does Mary say that John gives flowers . 
(d2 ) To whom does Mary think that John gives flowers . 
Principle 3 prefers arguments over modifiers.
Figure 3 shows that principle 3 predicts the prefer rederivation tree for ( e ) : " to be honest " argument of " prefer " , ruling out ' to be honest " as sentence modifier ( i . e . " To be honest , hep refers his daughter ") . 
( e ) John prefers his daughter to be honest.
These three principles aim at attaching arguments as accurately as possible and do not deal with " strict " modifier attachment for the following reasons : ? There is a lack of agreement concerning the validity of preferences principles for " modifier attachment "? Principle  3  , which deals the most with modifier attachment , turned out the least conclusive when confronted to empirical data ? We wanted to evaluate how attaching arguments correctly affects ambiguity  , all other factors remaining unchanged .

FIGURE 3
Illustration of Principle 3 ( The engineer obtains the agreement of the company /from the company  ) Principle 3 did not prove as useful as the two others : first  , it aims at favoring arguments over modifiers , but these cases were already handled by Principle  1   ( again because of co-heads )  . 
Second , it consistently made wrong predictions in cases of lexical ambiguity  ( e . git favored "& re " as a copula rather than as an auxiliary  , although the auxiliary is much more common in French  . ) . 
Therefore we have postponed testing it until further efinement is found  . 
5 Conclusion
We have presented three application-independent , domain-independent and language-independent disambiguation principles formulated in terms of derivation trees within the framework of LTAGs  . 
But since they are straightforward to implement , these principles can be used for parse ranking applications or integrated into a parser to reduce nondeterminism  . Preliminary results are encouraging as to the soundness of at least wo of these principles  . Further work will focus on testing these principles on larger corpora  ( e . g . Le Monde ) as well as on other languages , refining them for practical purposes ( e . g . addition of frequency information and principles for modifiers attachment  )  . Since it is the first time to our knowledge that parsing preferences are formulated in terms of derivation trees  , it would also be interesting to see how this could be adapted to dependency-based parsing  .
