Abstract
This paper studies and evaluates disambiguation strategies for the translation of tense between German and English  , using a bilingual corpus of appointment scheduling dialogues  . It describes a scheme to detect complex verb predicates based on verb form subcategorization a d grammatical knowledge  . The extracted verb and tense information is presented and the role of different context factors is discussed  . 
1 Introduction
A problem for translation is its context dependence  . For every ambiguous word , the part of the context relevant for disambiguation must be identified  ( disambiguation strategy )  , and every word potentially occurring in this context must be assigned a bias for the translation decision  ( disambigt , ation information ) . Manual construction of disambiguation components iquit each or e  . Fortunately , the task can be ( partly ) automated if the tables associating words with biases are learned from a corpus  . Statistical approaches also support empirical evaluation of different disambiguation strategies  . 
The paper studies disambiguation strategies for tense translation between German and English  . The experiments are based on a corpus of appointment scheduling dialogues counting  150  , 281 German and 154 , 773 English word tokens aligned in 16 , 857 turns . The dialogues were recorded , transcribed and translated in the German national Verbmobil project that aims to develop a trilingual spoken language translation system  . Tense is interesting , since it occurs in nearly every sentence . Tense can be ex-*This work was funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education  , Science , Research and Technology ( BMBF ) in the framework of the Verbmobil Project under Grant  01 IV 101 U .

pressed on the surface lexically as well as morphosyntactically  ( analytic tenses )  . 
2 Words Are Not Enough
Often , sentence meaning is not compositional but arises from combinations of words  ( 1 )  . 
(1) a . Ich habeihn gestern gese hen.
I have him yester day seen
Is a whimy esterday.
b . Ich schlage Montag vor.
I beat Monday forward
I suggest Monday.
c . Ichm Schtemich beschweren.
I'd like to myself weighd own
I'd like to make a complaint.
For translation , the discontinuous words must be amalgamated into single semantic items  . 
Single words or pairs of lemma and part of speech tag  ( L-POS pairs ) are not appropriate . 
To verify this claim , we aligned the L-POS pairs of the Verb mobil corpus using the completely language-independent method of Dagan et al  .  (1993) . Below find the results for sehen 1 ( see ) in order of frequency and some frequent alignments for reflexive pronouns  . 
sehen:VVFIN be:VBZ ( aussehen ) sehen:VVFIN do:VBP ( do-support ) sehen : VVFIN have:VBP ( perfect ) sehen:VVFIN see:VB 176 wir:PRF meet:VB ( sichtreffen ) 33 wir:PRF we:PP30 sich:PRFspell:VBN ( sich schreiben ) 16 ich : PRF forward : RP ( sich freuen auf ) 14 wir : PRF agree : VB ( sicheinigen ) 13 ich : PRF myself : PP1 The prefix verb aus-sehen ( look , be ) is very frequent in the corpus , it often occurs in questions . Present sehen was frequently translated into perfect discover  . 
11833 Partial Parsing
A full syntactic analysis of the sort of unrestricted spoken language text found in the Verbmobil corpus is still beyond reach  . Hence , we took a partial parsing approach . 
3.1 Complex Verb Predicates
Both German and English exhibit complex verb predicates  ( CVPs )  , see (2) . Every verb and verb particle belongs to such a CVP and there is only one CVP per clause  . 
(2) He would not have called meup.
The following two grammar fragments describe the relevant CVP syntax for English and German  . Every auxiliary verb governs only one verb , so the CVP grammar is basically 2 regular and implementable with finite-state devices  . 
S--+... VP ...
VP--+hd:V(to)VP
VP--+hd:V ... ( Particle)
S--+...hd:V fin...(Refi )... VC ...
S - - + . . . ( Refl ) . . . VC . . .
S--~... VChd:V fin . . . ( Refl ) ...
vc~(vc)(zu)hd:V
VC - - + Separated Verb Prefix
English CVPs are left-headed , while German CVPs are partly left- , partly right-headed . 
, ~ CVP/~VP 4.\//%',/ VP4,\',/
Erwirdes get an haben mi is senhe will it done have must 
He will have to have done it.
2The grammar does not handle insertion of CVPs into other CVPs and partially fronted verb complexes  ( 3 )  .

3.2 Verb Form Subcategorization
Auxiliary verbs form a closed class . Thus , the set sub ( v ) of infinite verb forms for which an auxiliary verb v subcategorizes can be specified by hand  . English and German auxiliary verbs governthe following verb forms  . 
? infinitive e . g . will ? to-infinitive ( T ) e . g . want ? past participle ( P ) e . g . get ? PVT e . g . have ? present participle VPV Te . g . be ? infinitive ( I ) e . g . mi is sen ? zu-infinitive(Z)e . g . scheinen ? perf . part , with haben ( H ) e . g . be kommen ? HVIe . g . werden ? HVIV Ze . g . haben ? perf . part , with se in VHVIV Ze . g . sein 3 . 3 Transducers Two partial parsers ( rather : transducers ) are used to detect English and German CVPs and to translate them into predicate argument structures  ( verb chains )  . The parsers presuppose POS tagging and lemmatization  . A database associates verbs v with sets mor ( v ) of possible tenses or infinite verb forms . 
Let m =\[ mor ( v ) : Verb vii and n = I sub ( v ) : Verbv\[ . Then the English CVP parser needs n + 1 states to encode which verb forms , if any , are expected by a preceding auxiliary verb . 
Verb particles are attached to the preceding verb . The German CVP parser is more complicated , but also more restrictive as all verbs in a verb complex  ( VC ) must be adjacent . It operates in left-headed ( S ) or right-headed mode ( VC )  . In VC-mode ( i . e . inside VCs ) the order of the verbs put on the output tape is reversed  . 
In S-mode , n + 1 states again record the verb form expected by a preceding finite verb Vfin-VC-mode is entered when an infinite verb form is encountered  . A state in VC-mode records the verb form expected by Vi in  ( n + 1 )  , the infinite verb form of the last verb encountered  ( rn )  , and the verb form expected by the VC verb , if the VC consists of only one verb ( n+1) . So there are m?(n+1)2 states . As soon as a non-verb is encountered in VC-mode or the verb form of the previous verb does not fit the subcategorization requirements of the current verb  , a test is performed to see if the verb form of the last verb  i0000

In case the VC consists of only one verb that can be interpreted as finite  , the expected verb form is recorded in a new S -modestate  . Separated verb prefixes are attached to the finite verb  , first in the chain . 
3.4 Alignment
Iuthe CVP alignment , only 78 % of the turns proved to have CVPs on both sides , only 19% had more than one CVP on some side . CVPs were further aligned by maximizing the translation probability of the full verbs  ( yielding 16 , 575 CVP pairs ) . To ensure correctness , turns with multiple CVPs were inspected by hand . 
In word alignment inside CVPs , surplus tense-bearing auxiliary verbs were aligned with a tense-marked NULL auxiliary  ( similar to the
English auxiliary do).
3.5 Alignment Results
The domain biases the corpus towards the future . So only 5 out of 6 German tenses and 12 out of 16 English tenses occurred in the corpus . Both will and begoing to were analysed as future  , while would was taken to indicate conditional mood  , hence present .

Ambiguous tenses on the target side were disambiguated to fit the particular disambiguation strategy  .

E pres . /past ( should , could , must ) (1 , 218) 4 Evaluation Formally , we define source tense and target tense as two random variables S and T  . Disambiguation strategies are modeled as functions tr from source to target tense  . Precision figures give the proportion of source tense tokens ts that the strategy correctly translates to target tenset t  , recall gives the proportion of source-target tense pairs that the strategy finds out  . 
(4) precision tr(ts , tt ) =
P ( T = t t l S = t s , tr(ts ) = tt ) recall tr(ts , t t ) =
P ( tr(ts ) = ttlS = ts,T = tt)
Combined precision and recall values are formed by taking the sum of the frequencies in numerator and denominator for all source and target tenses  . Performance was crossvalidated with test sets of 10 % of all CVP pairs . 
4.1 Baseline
A baseline strategy assigns to every source tense the most likely target tense  ( tr ( ts ) = argmax ttP ( t t\[ts )  , strategy t ) . The most likely target tenses can be read off Figures  1 and 2  . 
Past tenses rarely denote logical past , as discussion circles around a future meeting event  , they are rather used for politeness .

4.2 Full Verb Information
Three more disambiguation strategies condition the choice of tense on the full verb in a CVP  , viz . the source verb ( tr(ts , vs ) -- argmaxttP ( ttlts , vs ) , strategy vs ) , the target verb ( tr(ts , vt ) , strategy vt ) , and the combination of source and target verb ( tr ( ts , ( vs , v t )) , strategy vst ) . The table below gives precision and recall values for these strategies and for the strategies obtained by smoothing  ( e . g . 
Vst , Vs , Vt , tisVst smoothed first with vs , then with vt , and finally with t ) . Smoothing with t results in identical precision and recall figures  .

Translation pairs approximate the verb semantics better than single source or target verbs  . The full verb contexts of tenses can also be used for verb classifications  . 
Aspectual classification : The aspect of a verb often depends on its reading and thus can be better extrapolated from an aligned corpus  ( e . g . I am having a drink ( trinken )) . German allows punctual events in the present , English prefers present perfect ( e . g . sehen , finden , fest-stellen ( discover , find , see ) , einfallen ( occur , remember ); treffen , er wischen , sehen ( meet )) . 
World knowledge : In many cases perfect maps an event to its result state  . 
finish forget denken an sich verabre densich vertunset tlea question  4  . 3 Subordinating =~ fertig sein =~ nicht mehr wissen =~ have in mind =~ have an appointment be wrong  ( the question ) is settled

Conjunctions often en gender different mood.
? In conditional clauses English past tenses usually denote presentenses  . Interpreting hypothetical past as present increases performance by about  0  . 3 % . 
1 186 * In subjunctivenvironments logical future is expressed by English simple present  . The verbs vorschlagen ( suggest )   ( in 11 out of 14 cases ) and sagen ( say )   ( 2/5 ) force simple present on verbs that normally prefer a translation to future  .

4.4 Representation of Tense
Tense can not only be viewed as a single item ( as sketched above , representation rt ) . In compositional analyses of tense , source tense S and target tense T are decomposed into components  ( S1 ,   .   .   . , Sn ) and ( T1, . . . , Tn ) . A disambiguation strategy triscorrect if Vi : tr  ( Si )  =

One decomposition is suggested by the encoding of tense on the surface  ( ( present/past , O/will/begoing to/wer den , O/have/haben/sein , 0/be ) , representation rs ) . Another widely used framework in tense analysis ( Reichenbach , 1947) (( E </~/> R , R </~/> S , ? progr ) , representation rr ) analyses English tenses as follows:
R~SR < SR > S
E~R present past
E < R present perf . past per f . fut . perf.
E>R future past
A similar classification can be used for German excep that present and perfect are analysed as ambiguous between present and future  ( E_>R ~ S and E < R_>S )  .

Strategy rr perform slightly worse than rt .

The pertaining disambiguation if ormation learned from the corpus is put into action in the symbolic transfer component of the Verb mobil system  ( Dorna and Emele ,  1996) . 
The only other empirical study of tense translation  ( Santos ,  1994 ) I am aware of was conducted on a manually annotated Portuguese-English corpus  ( 48 , 607 English ,  43 , 492 Portuguese word tokens and 6 , 334 tense translation pairs ) . It neither gives results for all tenses nor considers disambiguation factors  . Still , it acknowledges the surprising divergence of tense across languages and argues against the widely held belief that surface tenses can be mapped directly into an interlingual representation  . Although the findings reported here support this conclusion  , it should be noted that a bilingual corpus can only give one of several possible translations  .
