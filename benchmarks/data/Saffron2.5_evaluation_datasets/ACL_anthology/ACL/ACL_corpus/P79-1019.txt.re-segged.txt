People talk ? bout what they do , often ? t the same tame a ? they are doing . This reporting has ? n important function in coordinating aotlon between people working together on realeve ~/ day problems  . Zt is also ? n important acts ' cao ? data for social scientists sttu ~ ylng people's behavior  . Xnthispaper , we report on some ? tudle ? we are doing on report dialogues  . We describe two kinds of phenomena we have ident ified  , outline a preliminary process model that in t ? grat ? ? the report generation with the processes that are generating the actions being reported upon  , and specify a systematic methodology Forext racting relevant evidence bearing on these phenomenat ~ om text trenscrlpts of talk about doing to use in evaluating the model  .

Reports of problm solving actions are often used a ? evident ? about the und ? rlying cognitive processes involved in generating a problem solution  , as " problem solving protocols " ( Howell & Simon ,  1972) . However , these reports ere obviously a kind of language interaction in their own right  , in which the subject i ? reportlns on hls/hor own actions to the experimenter  . 
We have analyzed problem solving protocols of people solving a puzzle called " Hlsslonaries and Cannibals " and have found that in their repor t ?  , people adopt ? ? point or view " with respect to the problan  , through ? con?latent use of spatial detxts , For example , when a subject lays : " .   .   , X can't send another cannibal across with another alssi of lary or he will he outnumbered when he gets to the other side  .   .   , " the deixis Inher report places her as speaker off the ? from " side of the considered action  , This is indicated both by the choice of the verb "send " and by the description of " the other side "  . ? he same suhjeot indicated the " tonsldeas her point or view in another part or her protocol  : "   ,   .   . ' cause you ' vegotta have one person to hri ~ back the boat  .   .   . "4 Here , both the verb " bring " and the adverb " back " indicate " point ot view "  . 
Although people almost always unmmbiguoualy specify ? " point of view " within the problem they are solving in their reports  , they also deny awareness of takAn such ? point cF view  , However , this point or view is important to the underlying problem solving procesmas  . The strongest evidence for this comes ~ om the hi h correlation ~ etween Point or view and errors in problem solving actions  . Subjects in the ~ tlss lonarles and Cannibals task can make errors by Cabin actions that vio late the constraints or the task  . Host of these errors occur on the side a way frm their current " point stview "  , even the uah their point of view changes From one physical side to the other during the course or solving the punle  , mreinteresting is that most of the " undetected " error semcur on the side ? way from their point or view  . Some errors arm spontaneously detected by the subject ~ mmediately otter askant the action that leads to ? violation ! othersere " undetected "  . After the experimenter interrupts to polnt out these undetected errors  , the subjects often switch point of view so that the violation condition is now on the same sidea ? the subjects ' point of view  . 
We see the point of view indicated by ? patlal delxls In the report of problem solving as reflec ~ ir ~ an underlying allocation of effort  ( or attention )  . Pew errors occur with problem elements that ? re given processing effort  , while constraints that ? regiven little attention are more often violated  . 
% n this way , these reports are reflecting changes Zn the organization of the problem element ? that occur over the course of reaching a solution  . We have also identified other ways in which report ? embody the use of different conceptual organizations of the problem  , including org ? nlzatlons that vary from abstract to concrete and from perception oriented to action oriented  . 

There?re multi-utterance structures that occur regularly in problem solving talk that we cal l ? justltAoatlon argument structures  . " These structures have the form of: ( did )   ( do )   ( since )   ( could ) + ( not do ) + ( aotion )   .   ( bsc?use ) -> ( Just it loat lon ( will ) argument )   ( Alternatively , these two segments san hereversed in order , by using connectiv?s like " the retora " or " so  "  . ) For example , these kinds of dialogue units occur in many ot the protocols studied by New all & Simon  ( 1972 ) : " henletter has one and only one numerical value  , e . 
'(\[: One numerical value . ) There are ten different letters and each of them has one numer loal value  . 
Therefore , Zsan , iooklng at the WoD's each D is 5; therefore , Tiszero . " ( Hewell & 8Amen ,  1972:230-231 ) Zn studying our problem solving protocols tram the ~ tseionarles and Cannibals puzzle  , we have Identltied several kinds of argument structures  , depending on what kinds of problem solving approach ?? oh subject took to the problem at each point An time  . For example , one common justification argument structure is the ? elimination cf alternative ?" struntur ?: All av ? L labtea otlons A  . From this state except Ai can be ruled cut . 
Therefore-do actlon Ai , Here is a n-example of this
Mind of argument stru Sture : ? . . . % fZput a cannibal on , then hege e ? hack and the guys on the other side of the river  , the misslcnary , is outnumbered and he will be eaten .

For exmmp/ . e , we have been able to treAn ooder8 I : or eZAs bly de ~ erm ? nea the problem solving from a record of the problem solving report and a record of moves made  . Then , we use this extracted trace to evaluate our model of the role of point of view in problem solving  . 

We have reported here a three pronged approach to the study of problem solving action and report : I  ) the collected of data on problem solving and talk about problem solving  ,  2 ) development of a process model of these behaviors  , and 3 ) use of coding techniques to extract traces of " critical phenomena " from the transcripts for evaluating the model  . So far , we have focussed our efforts on two types of problem solving phenomena : the changes in the problem solver's organization of the problem  ( " point of view " )  , and systematic multl-utterance structures used to express the forms of inference used to solve the problem  ( " Justificatlon argument structures " )  .
