Abstract
We propose a new method for query-oriented extractive multidocument summarization . To enrich the information need representation of a given query , we build a cooccurrence graph to obtain words that augment the original query terms . We then formulate the summarization problem as a Maximum Coverage Problem with Knapsack Constraints based on word pairs rather than single words . Our experiments with the NTCIR ACLIA question answering test collections show that our method achieves a pyramid F3-score of up to 0.313, a 36% improvement over a baseline using Maximal Marginal Relevance.
1 Introduction
Automatic text summarization aims at reducing the amount of text the user has to read while preserving important contents , and has many applications in this age of digital information overload ( Mani , 2001). In particular , query-oriented multidocument summarization is useful for helping the user satisfy his information need efficiently by gathering important pieces of information from multiple documents.
In this study , we focus on extractive summarization ( Liu and Liu , 2009), in particular , on sentence selection from a given set of source documents that contain relevant sentences . One wellknown challenge in selecting sentences relevant to the information need is the vocabulary mismatch between the query ( i.e . information need representation ) and the candidate sentences . Hence , to enrich the information need representation , we build a cooccurrence graph to obtain words that augment the original query terms . We call this method Query Snowball.
Another challenge in sentence selection for query-oriented multidocument summarization is how to avoid redundancy so that diverse pieces of information ( i.e . nuggets ( Voorhees , 2003)) can be covered . For penalizing redundancy across sentences , using single words as the basic unit may not always be appropriate , because different nuggets for a given information need often have many words in common . Figure 1 shows an example of this word overlap problem from the NTCIR8 ACLIA2 Japanese question answering test collection . Here , two goldstandard nuggets for the question ? Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi ( Spirited Away ) is a full-length animated movie from Japan . The user wants to know how it was received overseas .? ( in English translation ) is shown . Each nugget represents a particular award that the movie received , and the two Japanese nugget strings have as many as three words in common : ??? ( review/critic )?, ???? ( animation )? and ?? ( award ).? Thus , if we use single words as the basis for penalising redundancy in sentence selection , it would be difficult to cover both of these nuggets in the summary because of the word overlaps.
We therefore use word pairs as the basic unit for computing sentence scores , and then formulate the summarization problem as a Maximum Cover Problem with Knapsack Constraints ( MCKP ) ( Filatova and Hatzivassiloglou , 2004; Takamura and Okumura , 2009a ). This problem is an optimization problem that maximizes the total score of words covered by a summary under a summary length limit.

We evaluate our proposed method using Japanese complex question answering test collections from NTCIR ACLIA?Advanced Crosslingual Information Access task ( Mitamura et al , 2008; Mitamura et al , 2010). However , our method can easily be extended for handling other languages.
2 Related Work
Much work has been done for generic multidocument summarization ( Takamura and Okumura , 2009a ; Takamura and Okumura , 2009b ; Celikyilmaz and Hakkani-Tur , 2010; Lin et al , 2010a ; Lin and Bilmes , 2010). Carbonell and Goldstein (1998) proposed the Maximal Marginal Relevance ( MMR ) criteria for nonredundant sentence selection , which consist of document similarity and redundancy penalty . McDonald (2007) presented an approximate dynamic programming approach to maximize the MMR criteria . Yih et al (2007) formulated the document summarization problem as an MCKP , and proposed a supervised method.
Whereas , our method is unsupervised . Filatova and Hatzivassiloglou (2004) also formulated summarization as an MCKP , and they used two types of concepts in documents : single words and events ( named entity pairs with a verb or a noun ). While their work was for generic summarization , our method is designed specifically for query-oriented summarization.
MMR-based methods are also popular for query-oriented summarization ( Jagarlamudi et al , 2005; Li et al , 2008; Hasegawa et al , 2010; Lin et al , 2010b ). Moreover , graphbased methods for summarization and sentence retrieval are popular ( Otterbacher et al , 2005; Varadarajan and Hristidis , 2006; Bosma , 2009). Unlike existing graphbased methods , our method explicitly computes indirect relationships between the query and words in the documents to enrich the information need representation.
To this end , our method utilizes within-sentence cooccurrences of words.
The approach taken by Jagarlamudi et al (2005) is similar to our proposed method in that it uses word cooccurrence and dependencies within sentences in order to measure relevance of words to the query.
However , while their approach measures the generic relevance of each word based on Hyperspace Analogue to Language ( Lund and Burgess , 1996) using an external corpus , our method measures the relevance of each word within the document contexts , and the query relevance scores are propagated recursively.
3 Proposed Method
Section 3.1 introduces the Query Snowball ( QSB ) method which computes the query relevance score for each word . Then , Section 3.2 describes how we formulate the summarization problem based on word pairs.
3.1 Query Snowball method ( QSB)
The basic idea behind QSB is to close the gap between the query ( i.e . information need representation ) and relevant sentences by enriching the information need representation based on cooccurrences . To this end , QSB computes a query relevance score for each word in the source documents as described below.
Figure 2 shows the concept of QSB . Here , Q is the set of query terms ( each represented by q ), R1 is the set of words ( r1) that cooccur with a query term in the same sentence , andR2 is the set of words ( r2) that cooccur with a word from R1, excluding those that are already in R1. The imaginary root node at the center represents the information need , and we assume that the need is propagated through this graph , where edges represent within-sentence cooccurrences . Thus , to compute sentence scores , we use not only the query terms but also the words in R1 and R2.
Our first clue for computing a word score is the query-independent importance of the word.
224 q q q r1 r1 r1 r1 r1 r1 r1 r2 r2 r2 r2 r2 r2 r2 r2 r2 r2
R1
R2
Q root r2 r2 r2 r2 r2
Figure 2: Cooccurrence Graph ( Query Snowball ) We represent this base word score by sb(w ) = log(N/ctf ( w )) or sb(w ) = log(N/n(w )), where ctf ( w ) is the total number of occurrences of w within the corpus and n(w ) is the document frequency of w , and N is the total number of documents in the corpus . We will refer to these two versions as itf and idf , respectively . Our second clue is the weight propagated from the center of the cooccurence graph shown in Figure 1. Below , we describe how to compute the word scores for words in
R1 and then those for words in R2.
As Figure 2 suggests , the query relevance score for r1 ? R1 is computed based not only on its base word score but also on the relationship between r1 and q ? Q . To be more specific , let freq(w,w ?) denote the within-sentence cooccurrence frequency for words w and w ?, and let distance(w,w ?) denote the minimum dependency distance between w and w ?: A dependency distance is the path length between nodes w and w ? within a dependency parse tree ; the minimum dependency distance is the shortest path length among all dependency parse trees of source-document sentences in which w and w ? cooccur . Then , the query relevance score for r1 can be computed as : sr(r1) = ? q?Q sb(r1) ( sb(q ) sumQ )( freq(q , r1) distance(q , r1) + 1.0 ) (1) where sumQ = ? q?Q sb(q ). It can be observed that the query relevance score sr(r1) reflects the base word scores of both q and r1, as well as the cooccurrence frequency freq(q , r1). Moreover , sr(r1) depends on distance(q , r1), the minimum dependency distance between q and r1, which reflects the strength of relationship between q and r1. This quantity is used in one of its denominators in Eq.1 as small values of distance(q , r1) imply a strong relationship between q and r1. The 1.0 in the denominator avoids division by zero.
Similarly , the query relevance score for r2 ? R2 is computed based on the base word score of r2 and the relationship between r2 and r1 ? R1: sr(r2) = ? r1?R1 sb(r2) ( sr(r1) sumR1 )( freq(r1, r2) distance(r1, r2) + 1.0 ) (2) where sumR1 = ? r1?R1sr(r1).
3.2 Score Maximization Using Word Pairs
Having determined the query relevance score , the next step is to define the summary score . To this end , we use word pairs rather than individual words as the basic unit . This is because word pairs are more informative for discriminating across different pieces of information than single common words . ( Recall the example mentioned in Section 1) Thus , the word pair score is simply defined as : sp(w1, w2) = sr(w1)sr(w2) and the summary score is computed as : fQSBP ( S ) = ? { w1,w2|w1 6=w2 and w1,w2?u and u?S } sp(w1, w2) (3) where u is a textual unit , which in our case is a sentence . Our problem then is to select S to maximize fQSBP ( S ). The above function based on word pairs is still submodular , and therefore we can apply a greedy approximate algorithm with performance guarantee as proposed in previous work ( Khuller et al , 1999; Takamura and Okumura , 2009a ). Let l(u ) denote the length of u . Given a set of source documents D and a length limit L for a summary,
Require : D,L 1: W = D,S = ? 2: while W 6= ? do 3: u = argmaxu?W f(S?{u})?f(S ) l(u ) 4: if l(u ) + ? uS?S l(uS ) ? L then 5: S = S ? { u } 6: end if 7: W = W/{u } 8: end while 9: umax = argmaxu?D f(u ) 10: if f(umax ) > f(S ) then 11: return umax 12: else return S 13: end if where f (?) is some score function such as fQSBP .
We call our proposed method QSBP : Query Snowball with Word Pairs.

Table 1: ACLIA dataset statistics
We evaluate our method using Japanese QA test collections from NTCIR7 ACLIA1 and NTCIR8 ACLIA2 ( Mitamura et al , 2008; Mitamura et al ., 2010). The collections contain complex questions and their answer nuggets with weights . Table 1 shows some statistics of the data . We use the ACLIA1 development data for tuning a parameter for our baseline as shown in Section 4.2 ( whereas our proposed method is parameter-free ), and the ACLIA1 and ACLIA2 test data for evaluating different methods The results for the ACLIA1 test data are omitted due to lack of space . As our aim is to answer complex questions by means of multidocument summarization , we removed factoid questions from the ACLIA2 test data.
Although the ACLIA test collections were originally designed for Japanese QA evaluation , we treat them as query-oriented summarization test collections . We use all the candidate documents from which nuggets were extracted as input to the multidocument summarizers . That is , in our problem setting , the relevant documents are already given , although the given document sets also occasionally contain documents that were eventually never used for nugget extraction ( Mitamura et al , 2008; Mitamura et al , 2010).
We preprocessed the Japanese documents basically by automatically detecting sentence boundaries based on Japanese punctuation marks , but we also used regular-expression-based heuristics to detect glossary of terms in articles . As the descriptions of these glossaries are usually very useful for answering BIOGRAPHY and DEFINITION questions , we treated each term description ( generally multiple sentences ) as a single sentence.
We used Mecab ( Kudo et al , 2004) for morphological analysis , and calculated base word scores sb(w ) using Mainichi articles from 1991 to 2005.
We also used Mecab to convert each word to its base form and to filter using POS tags to extract content words . As for dependency parsing for distance computation , we used Cabocha ( Kudo and Matsumoto , 2000). We did not use a stop word list or any other external knowledge.
Following the NTCIR-9 one click access task setting1, we aimed at generating summaries of Japanese 500 characters or less . To evaluate the summaries , we followed the practices at the TAC summarization tasks ( Dang , 2008) and NTCIR ACLIA tasks , and computed pyramid-based precision with an allowance parameter of C , recall , F ? ( where ? is 1 or 3) scores . The value of C was determined based on the average nugget length for each question type of the ACLIA2 collection ( Mitamura et al , 2010). Precision and recall are computed based on the nuggets that the summary covered as well as their weights . The first author of this paper manually evaluated whether each nugget matches a summary . The evaluation metrics are formally defined as follows : precision = min ( C ? (] of matched nuggets ) summary length , 1 ) , recall = sum of weights over matched nuggetssum of weights over all nuggets ,
F ? = (1 + ? 2) ? precision ? recall ?2 ? recision + recall .
4.2 Baseline
MMR is a popular approach in query-oriented summarization . For example , at the TAC 2008 opinion summarization track , a top performer in terms of pyramid F score used an MMR-based method.
Our own implementation of an MMR-based baseline uses an existing algorithm to maximize the following summary set score function ( Lin and Bilmes , 2010): fMMR(S ) = ? ( ? u?S
Sim(u , vD ) + ? u?S
Sim(u , vQ ) ) ?(1 ? ?) ? {( ui,uj)|i 6=j and ui,uj?S}
Sim(ui , uj ) (4) where vD is the vector representing the source documents , vQ is the vector representing the query terms , Sim is the cosine similarity , and ? is a parameter.
1http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/tesakai/1click.aspx sentences reflect the entire documents ; the second term reflects the relevance of the sentences to the query ; and finally the function penalizes redundant sentences . We set ? to 0.8 and the scaling factor used in the algorithm to 0.3 based on a preliminary experiment with a part of the ACLIA1 development data . We also tried incorporating sentence position information ( Radev , 2001) to our MMR baseline but this actually hurt performance in our preliminary experiments.
4.3 Variants of the Proposed Method
To clarify the contributions of each components , the minimum dependency distance , QSB and the word pair , we also evaluated the following simplified versions of QSBP . ( We use the itf version by default , and will refer to the idf version as QSBP(idf ). ) To examine the contribution of using minimum dependency distance , We remove distance(w,w ?) from Eq.1 and Eq.2. We call the method QSBP(nodist).
To examine the contribution of using word pairs for score maximization ( see Section 3.2) on the performance of QSBP , we replaced Eq.3 with : fQSB(S ) = ? { w|w?ui and ui?S } sr(w ) . (5) To examine the contribution of the QSB relevance scoring ( see Section 3.1) on the performance of
QSBP , we replaced Eq.3 with : fWP ( S ) = ? { w1,w2|w1 6=w2 and w1,w2?ui and ui?S } sb(w1)sb(w2) . (6) We will refer to this as WP . Note that this relies only on base word scores and is query-independent.
4.4 Results
Tables 2 and 3 summarize our results . We used the twotailed sign test for testing statistical significance . Significant improvements over the MMR baseline are marked with a ? (?=0.05) or a ? (?=0.01); those over QSBP(nodist ) are marked with a ] (?=0.05) or a ]] (?=0.01); and those over QSB are marked with a ? (?=0.05) or a ?? (?=0.01); and those over WP are marked with a ? (?=0.05) or a ? ? (?=0.01). From Table 2, it can be observed that both QSBP and QSBP(idf ) significantly outperforms QSBP(nodist ), QSB , WP and the baseline in terms of all evaluation metrics . Thus , the minimum dependency distance , Query Snowball and the use of word pairs all contribute significantly to the performance of QSBP . Note that we are using the ACLIA data as summarization test collections and that the official QA results of ACLIA should not be compared with ours.
QSBP and QSBP(idf ) achieve 0.312 and 0.313 in F3 score , and the differences between the two are not statistically significant . Table 3 shows the F3 scores for each question type . It can be observed that QSBP is the top performer for BIO , DEF and REL questions on average , while QSBP(idf ) is the top performer for EVENT and WHY questions on average . It is possible that different word scoring methods work well for different question types.

Table 3: F3-scores for each question type ( ACLIA2 test ) 5 Conclusions and Future work We proposed the Query Snowball ( QSB ) method for query-oriented multidocument summarization . To enrich the information need representation of a given query , QSB obtains words that augment the original query terms from a cooccurrence graph . We then formulated the summarization problem as an MCKP based on word pairs rather than single words . Our method , QSBP , achieves a pyramid F3-score of up to 0.313 with the ACLIA2 Japanese test collection , a 36% improvement over a baseline using Maximal
Marginal Relevance.
Moreover , as the principles of QSBP are basically language independent , we will investigate the effectiveness of QSBP in other languages . Also , we plan to extend our approach to abstractive summarization.
