The language of scene descriptions 2 must allow ahearer to build structures of schemas similar  ( to some level of detail ) to those the speaker has built via perceptual processes  . The understanding process in general requires a hearer to create and run " event ~" to check the consistency and plausibility of a " picture " constructed from a speaker's description  . 
A speaker must also run similar event simulations on his own descriptions in order to be able to judge when the hearer has been given sufficient information to construct an appropriate " picture  "  , and to be able to respond appropriately to the heater's questions about or responses to the scene description  . 
In this paper I explore some simple scene , description examples in which a hearer must make judgements involving reasoning about scenes  , space , common sense physics , cause-effect relationships , etc . 
While I propose some mechanisms for dealing with such scene descriptions  , my primary concern at this time is tO flesh out our understanding of just what the mechanisms must accomplish : what information will be available to them and what information must be found or generated to account for the inferences we know are actually made  . 
1. THE PROBLE MAREA
An entity ( human or computer ) that could be said to fully understand scene descriptions would have to have a broad range of abilities  . For example , it would have to be able to make predictions about likely futures  ; to judge certain scene descriptions to be implausible or impossible  ; to point to items in a scene , given a description of the scene ; and to say whether or not a scene description corresponded to a given scene experienced through other sensory modes  . 3 In general , then , the entity would have to have a sensory system that it could use to generate scene representations to be compared with scene representations it had generated on the basis of natural language input  . 
In this paper I concentrate on I ) the problems of making appropriate predictions and inferences about described scenes  , and 2 ) the problem of judging when scene descriptions are physically implausible or impossible  . 
I do not consider directly problems that would require avision system  , problems such as deciding whether a linguistic scene description is appropriate for a perceived scene  , or generating lingulstic scene descriptions from visual input  , or learning scene description lar4uage through experience . 
I also do not consider speech act aspects of scene descriptions in much detail here  . I believe that the principles of speech acts transcend topics of language  ; I am not convinced that the study of scene descriptions would lead to major insights into speech acts that couldn't be as well gained through the study of language in other domains  .

2The term " scene " is intended to coyer both static scenes and dynamic scenes  ( or events ) that are bounded in space and time . 
3In general ! believe that many of the event simulation procedure sought to involve kines the ti c and t actile information  . I by no means intend the simulations to be only visual  , although we have explored the A1 aspects of vision far more than those of any other senses  . 
Ido believe , however , that the study of scene descriptions has a considerable bearing on other areas of language analysis  , including syntax , semantics , and pragmatics . For example , consider the following sentences : ( $ I ) I saw the man on the hill with my owne yes . 
(32) I saw them an on the hill with a telescope.
($3) I saw the man on the hill with a red ski mask . 
The wellknown sentence $2 is truly ambiguous , but $ I and $3 , while likely to be treated as syntactically similar to  $2 by current parsers , are each relatively unambiguous ; I would like to be able to explain how a system can choose the appropriate parsings in these cases  , as well as how a sequence of sentences can add constraints to a single scene-centered representation  , and aid in disam Diguation . For example , if given the pair of sentences : ( $2 ) I saw them an on the hill with a telescope . 
($4 ) I cleaned the lens to get a better view of him . 
a language understanding system should be able to select the appropriate reading of  $2  . 
I would also like to explore mechanisms that would be appropriate for judging that  ( $5 ) My dach shund bit our mail man on the ear . 
requires an explanation ( dach shunds could not jump high enough to reach a mailman'sear  , and there is no way to choose between possible scenarios which would get the dachs und high enough or the mail man low enough for the biting to take place  )  . The mechanisms must also be able to judge that the sentences :  ( $6 ) My doberman bit our mail man on the ear . 
($7) My dach shund bit our gar dener on the ear.
($8) My dach shund bit our mail man on the leg.
do not require explanations.
A few words about the importance of explanation are in order here  . If a program could judge correctly which scene descriptions were plausible and wnich were  no5  , but could not explain why it made the judgements it did  , I think I would feel profoundly dissatisfied with and suspicious of the program as a model of language comprehension  . A programought to consider the " right options " and decide among them for the " right reasons " a if it is to be taken seriously as a model of cognition  . 
! will argue that scene descriptions are often most naturally represented by structures which are  , at least in part , only awkwardly viewed as propositional ; such representations include coordinate systems , trajectories , and event-simulating mechanisms , i . e . 
procedures w~ich setup models of objects , interactions , and constraints , " set them in motion " , and " watch what happens " . I suggest that event simulations are supported by mechanisms that model common sense physics and human behavior I will also argue that there is no way to put limits on the degree of detail which may have to be considered in constructing event simulations  ; virtually any feature of an object can in the right circumstances become centrally important  . 
4 An explanation need not be in natural language ; for example , I probably could be convinced via traces of a program's operation that it had been concerned with the right issues in judging scene plausibility  . 
2. THENATUREOFSCENEDESCRIPTIONS
I have found it useful to distinguish between static and dynamic scene descriptions  . Static scene descriptions express spatial relations or actions in progress  , as in : ($9) The pencilis on the desk . 
($ I0) A helicopter is flying overhead.
($11) My dach shund was biting the mail man.
Sequences of sentences can also be used to specify a single static scene description  , a process I will refer to as " detail addition " . As an example of detail addition , consider the following sequence of sentences ( taken from Waltz & Bog ~ ess\[I\] ) :  ( $12 ) A gold fish is in a fish bowl . 
(313) The fish bowlison astand.
(S14)' The stand is on a desk.
($15) The desk is in a room.
A program written by BoKE ess \[2\] is able to build a representation of these sentences by assigning to each object mentioned a size  , position , and orientation in a coordinate system , as illustrated in figure I . I will refer to such representations as " spatial analog models "  ( in\[I\] they were called " visual analog models "  )  . 
Objects in Bog Eesa's program are defined by giving values for their typical values of size  , weight , orientation , surfaces capable of supporting other objects , as well as other properties such as " hollow " or " solid "  , and SO on . 
Fi~eIA " visual analog model " of $12-$15.
Dynamic scene descriptions can use detail addition also  , but more co- , -only they use either the mechanisms of " successive refinement "  \[3\] or " temporal addition " . 
" Temporal addition " refers to the process of describin  6 events through a series of tlme-ordered static scene descriptions  , as in: ( $16 ) Our mail man fell while running from our dachs hund . 
($17) The dach shund bit the mail man on the ear.
" Successive refinement " refers to a process where an introductory sentence sets up a more or less prototypl calevent which is then modified by succeeding sentences  , e . g . by listing exceptions to one's ordinary expectations of the prototype  , or by providing specific values for optional items in he prototype  , or by similar means . The following sentences provide an example of " successive refinement ":  ( $18 ) A car hit a boynear curhouse . 
($19 ) The car was speeding east ~ ard on Main Street ~ t the time  . 
($20) The boy , ~ was riding a bicycle , was knocked to th ~~ round . 
3 . THEGOALSO FASCENEUN DERST ANDING SYSTEM What should a scene description understanding system to do with a linguistic scene description ? Basically I  ) verify plaus I Dillty , 2) make inferences and predictions , 3) actif action is called for , and a ) remember whatever is important . For the time being , I am only considering I ) and 2) in detail . In order to carry out I ) and 2) , I would llke my system to turn scene descriptions  ( statiu or dynamic ) into a time sequence of " expanded spatial analog models "  , where each expanded spatial analog model represents either I  ) a set of spatial relationships ( as in $12-$15 )  , or 2 ) spatial relationships plus models of actions in progress  , chosen from a fairly large set of primitive actions  ( see below )  , or 3 ) prototypical actions that can stand for sequences of primitive actions  . These prototypical actions would have to be fitted into the current context  , and modified according to the dictates of the objects and modifiers that were supplied in the scene description  . 
The action prototype would have associated selection restrictions for objects  ; if the objects in the scene description matched the selection restrictions  , then there would be no need to expand the prototype into primitives  , and the " before " and " after " scenes ( similar to pro - and post-condltions ) of the action prototype could be used safely . 
If the selection restrictions were violated by objects in the scene  , or if modifiers were present , or if the context did not match the preconditions  , then it would have to be possible to adapt the action prototype " appropriately "  . It would also have to be possible to reasonabOut the action without actually running the event simulation sequence underlying it in its entirety  ; sections that would have to be modified , plus before and after models , might be the only portions of the simulation actually run  . The rest of the prototype could be treated as a kind of " black box " with known input-output characteristics  . 
I have not yet fotm daprin cipled way to enumerate the primitives mentioned above  , but I believe that there should be many of them , and that they should not necessarily be non -overlapplng  ; what is most important is that they should have precise representations in spatial analog models  , and be capable of being used to generate plausible candidates for succeding spatial analog models  . Some examples of primitives I have looked at and expect to include are : brea ~- object-lnto-part a  , mechanl cally-join-parts , hit , tough , support , translate , fall . 
As an example of the expansion of a non-primitive action into primitive actions  , consider " bitexy " ; its steps are : 1 ) \[set-up\]instant latex ~ asa " biting-thing " -- defaults = mouth  , teeth , jaws of an animate entity ; 2) instantiate y as " thlng-bitten " ;  3 ) \[ before\]x is open and does not touchy and x partially surrounds y  ( i . e . y is not totally Inside x ) ; ~) x is closing on y ; 5)\[actlon\]xistouchingy , preferably in two places on opposite sides of y and x continues to close  ; 6) x deforms y ; 7) falter \] x is moving away from y , and no longer touches y . 
Finally , lest it should not ~ e clear from the sketchiness of the comaents above  , I am by no means satisfied yet with these ideas as an explanation of scene description understanding  , although I am confident that this research is headed in the right general direction  . 
4. PLAUSIBILITY JUDGEMENT
The basic argument I am advancing in this paper is this : it is essential in understandlng scene descriptions to setup and run event simulations for the scenes  ; we judge the plausibility ( or possiDility ) , meaningfulness , and completeness of a description on the basis of our experience in attempting to set up and run the simulation  . By studying cases where we judge descriptions to be implausible we can gain insight into Just what is done routinely dm'ing the understanding of scene descriptions  , since these cases correspond to failures in setting up or running event simulations  . 
5By " instantiate an X " I mean assign X a physical place  , posture , orientation , etc . or retrieve a pointer to sv ~ han instantia tion  , if it is a familiar one . Th 3 " instantiate a ~ aby " would retrieve apo inter  , w~ereaa " instantiate a two-neaded dog " would proPaPly have to attempt to generate one on the spot  . Note that this process may itself fail , i . e . that an entity may not be able to " imagine " such an object  . 
As the examples below illustrate , sometimes an event simulation simply cannot be setup because information is missing  , or several possible " pictures " are equally plausible  , or the objects and actions being described cannot be fitted together for a variety of reasons  , or the results of running the simulation do not match our knowledge of the world or the following portions of the scene description  , and so on . It is also important to empbaclze that our ultimate interest is in being able to succeed in setting up and running event simulations  ; therefore I have for the most part chosen ambiguous examples where at least one event slmuiation succeeds  . 
4 . 1 TRANSLATING AN OLD EXAMPLE INTO NEW MECHANISMS Consider Bar-Hillel's famous sentence  \[4\]:   6   ( $ I0 ) The box is in the pen . 
Plausibility Judgement is necessary to choose the appropriate reading  , i . e . that " pen "= playpen . Minor extensions to Boggess's program could allow it to choose ? the appropriate referent for pen  . Penl ( the writing implement ) would be defined as having a relatively fixed size  ( subject to being overridden by modifiers , as in " tinypen " or " twelve inchpen ") , but the size of cen2 ( the enclosure ) would be allowed to vary over a range of values ( as would the size of box )  . The program could attempt to model the sentence by instant latlng standard  ( default-sized ) models of box , penl , and pen2 , and attempting to assign the objects to positions in a coordinate system such that the box would be in perilor  pen2  . Pen ; could not take part in such a spatial analog model both because of  pen1's rigid size , and the extreme shrinkage that would be required of box  ( outside box's allowed range ) to make it smaller than the pen ;  , and also because pen ; is not a container ( i . e . hollow object ) .   Pen2 and box prototypes could be fitted together without problems  , and could thus be chosen as the most appropriate interpretation  . 
4.2 ASIMPLEEVENTSIMULATION
Extending Boggess's program to deal with most of the other examples given in this paper so far would be harder  , although I believe that $ I-$4 could be handled without too much difficulty . Let us look at $2 and S ~ in more detail: ( $2 ) I saw them an on the hill with a telescope . 
($4 ) I cleaned the lens to get a better view of him . 
After being told $2 , a system would either pick one of the possible interpretations as most plausible  , or it might be unable to choose between competing interpretations  , and keep them both . When it is told $4 , the system must first discover that " the lens " is part of the telescope  . Having done this ,   $4 unambiguously forces the placement of the speaker to be close enough to the telescope to touch it  . This is because all common interpretations of clean require the agent to be close to the object  . At least two possible interpretations still remain : I  ) the speaker is distant from them a nonthe hill , and is using the telescope to view them an ; or 2) the speaker , telescope , and manon the hill are all close together . The phrase " to get a better view of him " refers to the actions of the speaker in viewing the man  , and thus makes interpretation I ) much more likely , but 2) is still conceivable . The reasoning necessary to choose I ) as most plausible is rather subtle , involving the idea that telescopes are usually used to look at distant objects  . 
In any case , the proposed mechanisms should allow a system to discard an interpret atllon of  $2 and S~where them an on the hill had a telescope and was distant from the speaker  . 
6A central figure in the machine translation effort of the late  5O's and early 6O's   , Bar-Hillel cited this sentence in explaining why machine translation was impossible  . He subsequently quit the field . 
4.3 SIMULATING ANIMPLAUSIBLEEVENT
Let us also look again at $5: ( $5 ) My dach shund bit our mail man on the ear . 
and be more specific about what an event simulation should involve in this rather complex case  . The event simulation setup procedures I envision would  . execute the following steps : I ) instantiate a standard mail man and dach shund in default positions  ( e . g . both standing on level ground out doors on a residential street with no special props other than the mail man's uniform and mail bag  )  ;  2 ) analyze the preconditions for " bite " to find that they require the dog's mouth to surround the mailman'sear  ;  3 ) see whether the dach shund's mouth can reach the mail man'sear directly  ( no )  ;  ~ ) see whether the dog can stretch high enough to reach  ( no ; this test would require an articulated model of the dog's skeleton or a prototypical representation of a dog on its hindlegs  . ) ;  5 ) see whether a dach shund could jump high enough ( no ; tbls step is decidedly nontrivial to implement ! "   )  ;  6 ) see whether the mail manordinarily gets into any positions w ~ ere the dog could reach hise ar  ( no )  ;  7 ) conclude that the mail man could not be bitten as stated unless default sizes or movement ranges are relaxed in some way  . Since there is no clearly preferred way to relax the defaults  , more information is necessary to make this an " unambiguous " description  . 
I have quoted " unambiguous " because the sentence  $5 is not ambiguous in any ordinary sense , lexically or structurally . What is ambiguous are the conditions and actions whlch could have led up to  $5  . Strangely enough , the ordinary actions of mail men ( checked in step 6 ) seem relevant to the judgement of plausibility in this sentence  . As evidence for this analysis , note that the substitution of " gardener " for " mailman " turns  ( $5 ) into a sentence that can be simulated without problems  . 
I think that it is significant that such peripheral factors can be influential in Judging the plausibility of an event  . At the same time , I am aware that the effect in this case is rather weak  , that people can accept this sentence without noting any strangeness  , so I do not want to draw conclusions that are too strong  . 
~.4 MAKING INFERENCE SABOUTSCENES
Consider the following passage : ( 91 ) YOU are at one end of a vast hall stretching forward out of sight to the west  . There are openings to either side . Nearby , a widest one stair case leads downward . The hall is filled with wisps of white mist swaying to and fro almost as if a live  . A cold wind blows up the stair case . There is a passage at the top of the dome behind you  . Roughst one steps lead up the d~e . 
Given this passage ( taken from the computer game " Adventure " ) one can infer that it is possible to move to the west  , north , south , or east ( up the roughstone steps ) . Note that this information is buried in the description  ; in order to infer this information , it would be useful to construct a spatial analog model  , TAltbough one could do it by simply including in the definition of a dog information about how high a dog can Jump  , e . g . no higher than twice the dog's length . 
However I consider tbls something of a " hack " , because it iKnores some other problems , for example the timing problem a dog would face in biting a small target like a person'sear at the apex of its highest jump  . I would prefer a solution that could , if necessary , perform an event simulation for step 5) , rather than trust canned data . 
with " you " facing west , and the scene features placed appropriately . In playing Adventure , it is also necessary to remember salient features of the scenes described so that one can reoo@ ~ Lize the same room later  , given a passage such as: ( P2 ) You ' reinh all of mists . Roughst one steps lead up the dome . There is a threatening littled warf in the room with you  . 
Adventure can only accept a very limited class of co-v  , and s from a player at any given point in the game . 
It is only possible to play the game because one can make reasonable inferences about what actions are possible at a given point  , i . e . take an object , move in s~e direction , throwaknife , open a door , etc . While I am not quite sure what make of my observations about this example  , I think that games such as Adventure are potentially valuable tools for gathering information about the kinds of spatial and other inferences people make about scene descriptions  . 
4.5 MIRACLES ANDWORLD RECORDS
With some sentences there may be no plausible interpretation at all  . In many of the examples which follow , it seems unlikely that we actually generate ( at least consciously ) an event simulation . Rather it seems that we have some shortcuts for recognizing that certain events would have to be termed " miraculous " or difficult to believe  . 
(32..2,) My cargoes 2000 miles on a tank of gas.
(323) Mary caught the bullet between herteeth.
($24 ) The child fell from the 10th story window to the street below , but was n't hurt . 
(325 ) We took the refrigerator home in the trunk of our VW Beetle  . 
($26 ) She ~ md given birth to 25 children by the age of 30  . 
(527 ) The robin picked up the hook and flew away with it  . 
(328 ) The child chewed up and swallowed the pair of scissors  . 
The Gulnness Book of World Records is full of examples that defy event simulation  . How one is able to Judge the plausibility of tsese  ( and how we ml ~ ht get a system to do so ) remains s ~ methl ~ of a mystery to me . 
The problem of recognizing obviously implausible events rapidly is an important one to consider for dealing with pronouns  . Often we choose the appropriate referent for a pronoun because only one of the possible referents could be part of a plausible event if substituted for the pronoun  . For example , " it " must refer to " milk " , not " baby " , in 329: ( $29 ) I didn't want the baby to get sick from drinking the milk  , so I boiled it . 
5. T~ROLKOFEVKNTSIMULATIONINA FULuT ~ ORY OF

I suggested in section 3 that a scene description understanding system would have to  1  ) verify the plausibility of a described scene ,  2 ) make inferences or predlction ~ about the scene , 3) actif action is called for , and ~) remember whatever is important . As pointed out in section ~ . 5 , event simulations may not even be need for all cases of plausibility judgement  . 
Furthermore , scene descriptions constitute only one of many possible topics of language  . Nonetheless , I feel that the study of event simulation is extremely important  . 
5 . 1 WHY ARE SIMPLE PHYSICAL SCENES WORTH CONSIDERING ? For a number of reasons  , methodological as well as theoretical , I believe that it is not only worthwhile , but also important to begin the study of scene descriptions with the world of simple physleai objects  , events , and physical behaviors with simple goals . 
I ) Methodologically it is necessary to pick an area of concentration which is restricted in some way  . The world of simple physical objects and events is one of the simplest worlds that links language and sensory descriptions  . 
2) As argued in the work of Piaget\[5\] , it seems likely that we come to comprehend the world by first mastering the sensory/motor world  , and then by adapting and building on our schemata from the sensory/motor world to understand progressively more abstract worlds  . In the area of language Jackendoff \[6\] offers parallelarg , ~ eents . Thus the world of simple physical objects and behaviors has a privileged positions in the development of cognition and language  . 
3 ) Few words in English are reserved for describing the abstract world only  . Most abstract words also have a physical meaning . In some cases the physical meanings may provide important metaphors for understanding the abstract world  , w ~ ile in other cases the same mechanisms that are used in the interpretation of the physical world may be shared with mechanisms that interpret the abstract world  . 
4 ) I would llke the representations I develop for linguistic scene descriptions to be compatible with representations I can imagine generating with a vision system  . Thus this work does have an indirect bearing on vision research : my representations characterize and put constraints on the types and forms of information It hinkavision system o ~ nt to be able to supply  . 
5) Even in the physical domain , we must come to grips with some processes that resemble those involved in the generation and understanding of metaphor : matching  , adaptation of schemata , ~ diflcation of stereotypical items to match actual items  , and the interpretation of items from different perspectives  . 
5 . 2 SCENE D~SCRIPTIONS AND A THEORY OF ACTION I take it as evident that every scene description  , indeed every utterance , is associated with some purpose or goal of a speaker  . The speaker's purpose affects the organizat ion and order of the speaker's presentation  , the items included and the items omitted , as well as word choice and stress . Any two witnesses of the same event will in general give accounts of it that differ on every level  , especially if one or both witnesses were participants or ~ as some special interest in the cause or outcome of the event  . 
For now I have ignored all these fact OrS of scene description understanding  ; I have not attempted an account of the deciphering of a speaker's goals or biases from a given scene description  . I have instead considered only the propositional content of scene description utterances  , in particular the issue ' of whether or not a given scene description could plausibly correspond to a real scene  . Until we can give an account of the Judgement of plausibility of description meanings  , we cannot even say now we recognize blatantlles ; from this perspective , understanding ~ someone mightlle or mislead , i . e . understanding the intended effect of an utterance  , is a secondary issue . 
There seems tome to be a clear need for a " theory of human action "  , both for purposes of event simulation and , more importantly , to provide a better overall framework for AI research than we currently nave  . While no one to my knowledge still accepts as plausible the " big switch " theory of intelligent action  \[7\]  , mos ~ AI work seems to proceed on the " big switch"ass  , ,mptions that it is valid to study intelligent behavior in isolated domains  , and that there is no compelling reason at this point to worry a ~ out whether  ( let al ne how ) the pieces developed in isolation will ultimately fit together  . 
5.3 ARETHEREM ANY WAYSTOSKIN % CAT ?
Spatial analog models are certainly not the only possible representation for scene descriptions  , hut they are convenient and natural in many ways . Among their advantages are : I ) computational adequacy for the ability to implicitly represent relationships between objects  , and to allow easy derivation of these relationships  ; 3) ease of interaction with a vision system , and ultimately appropriateness for allowing a mobile entity to n avlgate and locate objects  . The main problem with these representations is that scene descriptions are usually underspeclfled  , so that there is a range of possible locations for each object  . It thus becomes risky to trust implicit relationships between objects  . Event stereotypes are probably important because they specify compactly all the important relationships between objects  . 
5. ~ RELATED WORK
A number of papers related the the topics treated here have appeared in recent years  . Many are listed in \[8\] which also provides some ideas on the generation of scene descriptions  . This work has been pervasively influenced by the ideas of Bill Woods on " procedural semantics "  , especially as presented in \[9\] . 
Representations for largescale space ( paths , maps , etc . ) were treated in Kuipers ' thesis\[I0\] . Novak \[11\] wrote a program that generated and used diagrams for understanding physics problems  . Simmons \[12\] wrote programs that understood simple scene descriptions involving several known objects  . Inferences about the causes and effects of actions and events have been considered by Schank and  Abelson\[13\] and Rieger\[14\]  . 
J ohnson-Laird\[15\] has investigated problems in understanding scenes with spatial locative prepositions  , as has Herskovits\[16\] . Recent work by Forbus\[17\] has developed a very interesting paradigm for qualitative reasoning in physics  , built on work by de Kleer\[18 , 19\] , and related to work by Hayes\[20 , 21\] . My comments on pronoun resolution are in the same spiritas  Hobbs\[22\]  , although Hobbs's " predicate interpretation " is quite different from my " analog spatial models  "  . Ideason the adaptation of prototypes for the representation of  3D shape were explored in Waltz \[23\]  . A effort toward qualitative mechanics is described in Bundy  \[24\]  . Also relevant is the work on mental imagery of Kosslyn & 
Shwartz\[25\] and Hinton\[26\].
