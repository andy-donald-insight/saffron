The goal of thls work is the enrichment of human -machlnemteract Ions in a natural language envlronment  .   1 We want to provide a framework less restrictive than earlier ones by allowing a speaker leewayt n forming an utterance about a task and in determining the conversational vehicle to deliver it  , A speaker and listener cannot be assured to have the same beliefs  , contexts , backgrounds or goals at each point in a conversation  . As a result , dlffl cultles and mistakes arise when a listener interprets a speakers utterance  . These mistakes can lead to various kinds of mls understandlngs between speaker and hstener  . 
including reference failures or failure to understand the speaker'sm tentlon  . We call the semts understandlngs mls communmatlon Such m~s takes constitute a klnd of " ill-formed " input that can slowdown end possibly break down communication  . Our goal ~ s to recognize and Isolate such mls communl cattons and circumvent them  . Thlspaper will hlgh hght a particular class of mls communl cat lon-reference problems-by descr lbmg a case study  , includlng techniques for a voldlng failures of reference 
I Introduction
Cohen , Perrault and Allen showed in the lrpaper " Beyond Question Answering "  \[8~ that " ,  . . users of cluestlon-answerzng systems expect them to do more than just answer isolated questions - -they expect systems to engage tn conversation  . In doing ~ o , the systemts expected to allow users to be less than meticulously hteral ~ n conveying their zntent lons  , and tt is expected to make hngux stlc and pragmatic use of the previous discourse  . " Following in the lr foot steps , we want to build robust natural language processing systems that can detect and recover from mlsc~mmunl catton  . The development of such systems requires s study on how people communicate and how they recover from problems In communication  . This paper summarizes the results of a dissertation  \[13\] that tnvestl gates the kinds of mls communl catlon that occur in human communication with a special emphasis on reference prooiems  , i . e . . problems a listener has determining whom or what a speakerts talking about  .

the context of a natural language understand2ng system . The study of mzscommunl catlon is a necessary task wlthm such a context since any computer capable of communl cat ~ ng with humans tn natural language must be tolerant of the tm prec Ise  , lll-devlsed or complex utterances that people often use  . 
Our current research \[25 ,   26\] views most dialogues as being cooper at lve and goal directed  , l , e . . a speaker and hstener work together to achieve a common goal  . The interpretation of an utterance involves Identifying the underlying plan or goal that the utterance reflects  \[5  . I , 23\] . Thlsplan , however , is rarely , dever , obvious at the surface sentence level . 
A central issue In the interpretation of utterancests the transformation of sequences of imprecise  , zll-devised or complex utterances into well -speclhed plans that might be carried out by dialogue participants  . 
Within thls context , mls communl catlon can occur.
We ere particularly concerned with cases of mxs communl catlon from the heater's viewpoint  , such as when the hearer is mattentlve to . confused about , or misled about the zntent lons of the speaker . In ordinary exchanges speakers usually make assumptions regarding what the lrlisteners know about a topic of discussion  . They w111 leave out details thought to be superfluous \[2  .  19\] . Since the speaker really does not know exactly what a listener knows about a topic  , ttts easy to make statements that can be misinterpreted or not understood by the listener because not enough details were presented  . One principal source of trouble Is the description constructed by the speaker to refer to an actual object in the world  . The descmptl on can betm preclse , confused , ambiguous or over ! vspecl flc . It might be interpreted under the wrong context . This leads to dlffl culty for the hstener when figuring out what oble ct~s being described  , that Is . ref . erence identification errors . Such descriptions are " all-formed " input , the blame for ill-formedness may lie partly with the speaker and partly with the listener The speaker may have been sloppy or not taken the hearer into consideration  , the listener may be either remiss or unwilling to admithe can't understand the speaker and to ask the speaker for clarification  , or may slmply feel that he has understood when he zn fact has not  . 
Thls work ts part of an ongoing effort to develop a reference Identlfz catmn and plan recognition mechanism that can exhibit more " human-hke ' tolerance of such utterances  . Our goal zs to build a more robust system that can handle errorful utterances  , and ~ hat can be incorporated in exlstlng systems  . As a start , we have concentrated on reference tdentlfl catzon  . In conversation people use imperfect descriptions to communicate about objects  ; sometimes their partners succeed zn understanding and occasionally they fail  . Any computer hoping to play the part of a listener must be capable of taking what the it  . We are developing a theory of the use of extensional descrlpt lons that will help explam how people successfully use such imperfect descriptions  . 
We call thls the theory of reference mls communl cat i on Section  2 of this paper highlights some aspects of normal communication and then provides a general discussion on the types of miscommunl catlon that occur In conversation  , concentrating primarily on reference problems and motivating many of them with Illustrative protocols  . Section 3 presents possible ways around some of the problems of miscommunxcation in reference  . 
Motivated there is a partial Implementation of a reference mechanism that attempts to overcome many reference problems  . 
We are following the task-omented paradigm of Grosz \  [14 \] since it Is easy to study ( through videotapes )   . It places the world In front of you ( a primarily extensional world )   , and It limits the dlscuss lonw hlle stil l providing a rlch environment for complex descriptions  . The task chosen as the target for the system Is the assembly of a toy water pump  . 
The water pump Is reasonably complex , containing four subassemblies that are buil t from plastic tubes  , nozzles , valves , plungers , and caps that can be screwed or pushed together . A large corpus of dialogues concerning thls task was collected by Cohen  ( see\[7 .  8 .  9\])  . These dialogues contained instructions f roman " expert " to an " apprentice " that exp lain the assembly of the toy water pump  , Both participants were working to achieve a common goal-the successful assembly of the pump Thls domain Isrlchm perceptual info rmation  , allowing for complex descriptions of e lements in it  . The data provide examples of imprecision , confusion , and ambiguity as we ! las attempts to correct these problems The following exchange exemplifies one such situation  . Here AIs instructing J to assemble part of the water pump  . Refer to Figurel ( a ) for a picture of the pump . A and J are communicating verbally but nei ther can see the other  .   ( The bracketed text In the excerpt tells what was actually occurring while each utterance was spoken  .   ) Not lce the complexity of the speaker's descr iptions and the resultant processing requi red by the listener  , Thls dialogue illustrates when l is teners repair the speakers description in o rdert of lnd a referent  , when they repair their mz tlal reference choice once they are given more information  , and when they fall t ~ . choose a proper referent InLinp 7 , A :\[ , = scribes the two holes on the BAjEVALVE as " the httle hoie " J must repair the descrlpt lon  , reahzmg that A does nt really mean " one hole but is referring to t  , ~ e'two'holes .

C2M is communication
People must and do manage to resolve lots of ( potentaal ) mascommum cata on In everyday conversata on . 
Much of it as resolved subconscaously wlth the hstener unaware that anything is wrong  , Other mls commum catlon is resolved wath the listener actively deleting or replacang m formata on m the speakers utterance until It flts the current context  . Sometimes thls resolutlon Is postponed until the quest lonable part of the utterance is actually needed  . Shll . when all these fail . the h stener can ask the speaker to clarl fy what was said  .   2 There are many aspects of an utterance that the hstener can become confused about and that can lead to mas commun a catton  . The hstener can become confused about what the speaker intends for the referents  , the actaons , and the goals described by the utterance , Confuslons often appear to result from confhct between the current state of the conversation  . 
the overall goal of the speaker , or the manner In which the speaker presented the anformatlon  . However , when the hstener steps back and is able to discover what k ~ nd of confuslon ~ s occurring  , then the confusion can qulte possibly be resolved . 
2.1 Causes of mls communication
Thls sectaon attempts to motlvate a paradlgm for the kinds of conversation that we studled and traes to point outplaces m the paradlgm that leave room formls commum cat lon  . 
~' . 1 . 1 Ef fec ts of the s t ruc ture of task - or iented dia logues Task-or iented conversatlons have a speclfic goal to be achleved : the performance of a task  ( e . g . . \[14\]) . 
The part l clpants in the dlalogue can have the same skill level and they can slmply work together to accomplish the task  ; or one of them , the expert , could know more and could direct the other , the apprent lce . 
to perform the task . We have concentrated prlmarlly on the latter case -due to the protocols that we examlned-but many of our observations can be generahzed to the former case  , too . We will refer to thls as the apprent lce-expert domal n  . 
The vlew pomts of the expert and apprent lcediffer greatly In apprent lce-expert exchanges  . The expert , having an understandlng of the functlonahty of the elements in the task  . has more of a feel for how the elements work together  , how they go together , and how the ind lvl dual elements can be used . The apprent lcenormally has no such knowledge and must base hls decls lons on perceptual features such as shape  \[15\]  . 
The structure of the task affects the structure of the dlalogue  \[14  . part lcularly through the center of attent lon of the expert and apprent lce  . Thls is the phenomenon called focus \[14 .  20 .  24\] . whlch , in task-or lented dlalogues Is a very real and operational thlng  ( e . g . , focus is used In resolving anaphora creferences ) . 
Shafts ~ n focus correspond dlrectly to the task , ats subtasks , the oblects an a task and the subpleces of each object Focus and focus shifts are governed by many rules  \[14  .  :~0 ,   24\] Confusaon may result when expected shafts do not take place  . For example . If the expert changes focus to an object but never discusses Its subpaeces ~ such as an obvaous attachment surface  ) or never bothers to talk about the object reasonably soon after its antroduct lon  ( Le . , between the tame of ~ ts mtroduct lon and its use  . without digressing in a well-structured way In between  ( see\[20\] ) ) , then the apprent lce may become confused , leavang hlmr ~ peformls communl catlon . The reverse anfluence between focus and oblects can lead to trouble  , too . A shzft Infocus by the expert that does not have a man Hestatlon In the apprent lce's world wall also perplex the apprentice Focus also influences how descr:ptlons are formed  \[15  ,  2\] . The level of detail requlred in a description depends directly on the elements currently highlighted by the focus If the oblect to be descrabed Issam flar to other element ~ m focus  , the expert must be more speclh cm the formulation of the descrapt lonor may conslder shlftmg focus away from the posslbly ambiguous objects to one where the amblgulty wont occur  . 
2.2 Consequences of miscommunicatlon
In thls section we will make It clear that people dom : scommunl cate and yet they often manage to flxthlngs  . We will look at specl fic forms of mls communl cat lon and descrl be ways to detect them  . 
We will hzgh hght relat lons h ; ps between different mls communz cat ; on problems but won't necessarzly demonstrate ways to resolve each of them  . 
2An analysis of c la r i f i ca t ion suodialogues can be found  ; n\[17) . 
206 2 . 2 . 1 Ins tances of mtscommun/cat ion There are many ways hearers can get confused during a convers at ion  . Figure 2 outlines some of them that were derived from analyzing the water pump protocols  . This section defines and illustrates many of them through numerous excerpts  . Each excerpt is marked in parentheses to show what modality of communication was used  ( see \[9\] for a description about the collection of these excerpts  )   . Each bracketed portion of the excerpt expla in s what was occurring at that point in the d i alogue  . The confusions themselves , coupled with the description at the end of th is section on how to recognize when one of them is occurring  , provides motivation for the use of the algor ithm outlined in Section  3 as a means for repairing communication prob lems  . We will only discuss referent confusion tn this paper  . The other forms of confusion-Action . Goal , and Cogmtive Load-are described in \[11 .  13\] . Another categorization of confusmns that lead to conversation failure can be found in  \[22\]  . 
? Figure 2: A taxonomy of confusmns
Referent ~ on fuslon occurs when the listener is unable to correctly determine what the speaker is referring to with a particula rdescrlptmn  . \[t occurs when the descriptions In the ut terance are ambiguous or imprecise  , when there IS confusion between the speaker and listener about what the current focus or context Is  , or when the descriptions in the utterance are either incorrect or incompatible with the current or global context  . 
Erroneous Specificity
Ambiguous ( and . thus , imprecise ) descnpt xons can cause confusion about there ferent  . Excerpt 2 below illustrates a case where the speaker ' s description is underspecx fled-it does not provide enough dated to prune the set of possib le referents down to one  . 
Excerpt2 ( Pace-to-Face)
S1 . And now take the little red 3 . peg,\[P takes PLUG\]3 . Yes , 4 . and place it xn the hole at the 5 . greenend . 
\[P starts to put PLUG into OUTLETR of MAINTUBE  \]   6  . no 7 . the -- in the greenthing \[ Pputs PLUG into green part of PLUNGER\] 
P : 8. Okay.
In Line 4 and 5 , S describes the location to place a peg into a hole by giving spatial information  . Since the location is given relative to another location by " in the hole at the green end "  , it defines a region where the pegmight go instead of a specific location  . In this particular case , there are three possible holes to choose from that are near the greenend  . The listener chooses one-the wrong one-and inserts the peg into it  . Because this dialogue took place face to face  , S is able to correct the ambiguity in Lines 6 and 7  . 
A speaker's description can be imprecise in several possible ways  .   ( 1 ) It may contain features that do not readily apply in the domain  . In fine 3 , Excerpt 3 , the feature " funny " has no relevance to the l is tener  . 
It is not until A provides a fuller descr iption in Lines  5 to 8 that E is able to select the proper piece .   ( 2 ) It may use a vague head noun coupled with few or no feature values  ( and context alone does not necessarily suff ice to distinguish the object  )   . In Excerpt 4 , Line 9 , " attachment " is vague because all objects in the domain are attachable parts  . The expert's use of " attachment " was most likely to signal the action the apprent ice can expect to take next  . The use of the feature value " clear '* prov ides little benefit either because three clear  , unused parts exist . The size descriptor " little " prunesth is set of possible referents down to two contenders  .   ( 3 ) Enough feature values are provided but at leas tone value is too vague leading to trouble  . In Excerpt 5 , Line 3 , the use of the attribute value " rounded " to describe the shape does not sufficient ly reduce the set of four possible refe rents  ( though , in this particular instance , A correctly identifies it ) because the term is applicable to numerous parts In the dommn  . A more precise shape descriptor such as " be ll-shaped " or " cylindrical " would have been more beneficial to the listener  ,

Improper Focus
Focus confusion can occur when the speaker sets up one focus and then proceeds with another one without letting the listener know of the switch  ( i . e . , a focus shift occurs without any indication ) . An opposite phenomenon can also happen-the li stener may feel that a focus shift has taken place when the speaker actually never intended one  . These really are very similar-one Isviewed more strongly from the perspective of the speaker and the other from the listener  . 
Excerpt 6 below l Uustrates an mstance of the first type of focus confusion  . In the excerpt , the speaker ( S ) shifts focus without notifying the listener ( P ) of the switch . As the excerpt begins , P , sholding the TUBEBASE . S provides in Lines 1 to 16 mstructzons for P to attach the CAP and the SPOUT to outlets OUTLETI and  OUTLET2  , respectively , on the MAIN TUSE . UponP's successful completion of these at tachments  . S switches focusm Lines 17 to 20 to the TUSESASE assembly and requests P to screw tton to the bottom of the M  , e/NTUSE . White P completes the task . S realizes she left out a step in the assembly - the placement of the SLIDE VALVE into  OUTLET2 of the M , eJNTUSE before the SPOUTts placed over the same outlet  . S attempts to correct her mistake by request ingP to remove " the pies " ~ piece in ~ nes  22 and 23  . Since Snever indicated a shift in focus from the TUSE SASE back to the IPOUT  , Pmterprets " the pies " to refer to the TUSE SASE . 
Excerpt 6 ( Face-to-Face)

28 . And place the little redthing \[ P takes $ LID ~ ALVZ\]  29  . tn there first , \[ Pmserts SLXD~ALV Z into OUTLET ~ of M\[AINT ~ E  \]   30  . it fits loosely in there . 
Excerpt 7 below demonstrates the latter type of focus confusz on that occurs when the speaker  ( S ) sets up one focus-the M , 4\] NTUBE , which is the correct focus In this case-but then proceeds in such a manner that the l is tener  ( J ) thinks a focus shift to another piece , the TUBESASE , has occurred . Thus , Line 15 refers to " the lower side hole in the M , 4 1NTUBE " for S and " the hole in the TUBEBASE " for J . J has no way of realizing that he has focused incorrectly unless the description as he in terprets it doesn't have a realworld correla te  ( here something does satisfy the description so J doesn't sense any problem  ) or if , later in the exchange , a conflict arises 2O8 due to the mistake ( e . g , , a requested action cannot be performed ) . In Line 31 , J inserts a piece into the wrong hole because of the misunderstanding in Line  15  . 
Line 31 hints that J may have become suspicious that an ambiguity existed but since the task was successfully completed  ( i . e . , the red piece fit into the hole in the base ) , and since S did not provide any clarific at ion  , he assumed he was correct .

20 . You have one red piece 21 .   remamm8? upldA/NTUBE assembly and looks at TUBEBASE , rotatine the MAINTUBE so that TUBP-BASE is po intedup  , and sees the hole in it ; he then looks at the SLIDE VALVE\]

24. Take that red piece.

J ; 31 . On the very bottom ? starts to put it into the bottom hole of TUBEBASE-thoughhe indicates he is unsure of himself \] 
S : 32. On the bottom , 33. Yes.
M is focus can also occur when the speaker in adver tently lefts to distinguish the proper focus because he did not notice a possible ambiguity  ; or when , through no fault of the speaker , the listener just fails to recognize a switch in focus indicated by the speaker  . ~ xcerpt 7 above is an example of the first type because S failed to notice that an amblguzty existed since he never explicitly brought the TUBEBASE ei the rin toor out of focus  . He just assumed that J had the same perspective a shzm-a perspective in which uo ambiguity occurred  . 
Wrong Context
Context differs from focus . The context of a portion of a conversation is concerned with the po:nt of the discussion in that fragment and with the set of objects re levant to that discussion  , though not attended to currently . Focus pertains to the elements which a recur rently being attended to in the context  . 
For example , two people can share the same context but have di fferent focus assignments wt~hmit-we're both talking about the water pump but you're descr ibing the MA/NTUB ? and I'm descrlbmg the AIRCH  , 4MB? , q . Alternatively , we could JUst be uslng different contexts-I think you ' retalking about taking the pump apart but you ' retalking about replh ^ lng the pump with new parts-m both cases wem~v be sharing the same focus-the pump-but our conte ~  , s are totally off from one another . ~ The kinds of misunderstandings that can occur because of context problems are similar to those for focus problems :  ( 1 ) the speaker might setup or bexnone context for a discussion and then proceed in another one without effectively letting the listener know of the change  ,   ( 2 ) the listener may feel a change in context has taken place when in fact the speaker never Intended one  , or ( :3 ) the Listener fails to recognize an indicated context switch by the speaker  . Context affects reference because it helps define the set of available oblects that are possible contenders for the referent of the speaker's descriptions  . If the contexts of the speaker and listener differ  , then ms reference might result . 
Bad Analo Ey
An analogy ( see\[I0\] for ? discuss lonon analogies ) is a useful way to help descrl be an object by attemptlng to be more precise by using shared past expemence and knowledge-espec:ally shape and functional reformation  . If that past experxence or knowledge doesn't contain the reformation the speaker assumes it does or isn't there  , then trouble occurs . 
Thus . one more way referent confusion can occur Is by describing a no hact using ? poor analogy  . An analogy used to describe an object might not bespec:fic  4Groez   \[14  , lS\]would dem ~ ril ~ this a so difference in " taskDIane J~ileRai?ltlNnt  \[2e   ,   21\] m ~ uld say that the " c0mlmmjcativa gCNlie " dJffare ? l . 
2 O9 enough-confusing the listener because several pieces might conform to the analogy or  , tn fact , none at all appear to fit because discover ing a mapping between the analogous object and some piece in the environment Is too diff icult  . In Excerpt 8 , Jatfirst has trouble correctly sati sfyingA's functional analogy " stopper " in " the bag blue stopper "  , but finally selects what he considers to be the closest match to " stopper "  . 
Excerpt8 ( Telephone )
A:I.Okay . Now.

A .7 Yeah.
8 . the blg blue stopper 9 . and the blackring\[J drops AIRCHAMBER and takes the O-RING and the TUBEBASE \] In other cases t t might be too specific-confusing the listener because none of the available referents appear to fit it  . In Line 8 of Excerpt 6 , " nozzle-looking " forms a poor shape an a logy because the object being referred to a c tually Is a nelbow-shaped spout  . The " no zzle-looklng " part of the descrip tion convinced the listener that what he was looking for was something specific like a nozzle  ( which xs a small spout )   . Sometimes , when an oblect xsa clear representative of a specified analogy class  , the apprent 2ce may become confused , wondering why the expert both ered to form an analogymstead of just directly describ ing the object as a member of the class  . 
Hence , tt would not be surprising d the apprentice tgnoreu the best represent at nve of the class for some less obvious exemplar  . Thus , for example , Itts better to say " no zzle " instead of " nozzle-looking  .

Description incompatibility
Incompatible descriptions can lead to confus ion also  . A description is incompatible when ( 1 ) one or more of the specified conditions , i . e . , the feature va lues , do not satisfy any of the pieces ;   ( 2 ) when one or more specified constraints do not hold  ( e . g . . say ing " the loose one " when all ob jec ts a re t ight ly a t tached  )   . 
or ( 3 ) if no one object satisfies al_~l of the features specified in the description  . In Lines 7 and 8 of Excerpt 9 above , M's use of " the two pegholes " leads to be wi lderment for the listener because the descr ibed object has no holes in it  . Mactually meant " twopegs " . 
2.2.2 Detecting miscommunicatlon
Part of our research has been to examine how al is tener discovers the need for a repair of an utterance or a description during communication  . The incompatibility of a referent or act ion is one signal of possible trouble  . The appearance of an obstacle that blocks one from achieving a goal is another indication of a problem  . 
Incompatibillty
Two kinds of incompat ~ btltty , action or referent . 
appear In the taxonomy of confusions . The strongest hint that there is a reference problem occurs when the listener finds no realworld object to correspond to the speaker 's description  . This can occur when ( 1 ) one or more of the specified feature values xn the description are not satisfied by any of the pieces  ( e . g . saying " theorange cap " when none of the ob jects are orange ~  .  2 ) when one or more specified constraints do not hold  ( e . g . , say ing " the red plug that f i ts loose ly " when all the red plugs attach tightly  )   , or ( 3 ) If no one object satisfies all of the features specified m the description  ( I . e . , ther ' e - ts , for each feature , an object that exhibits the specified feature value  , but no one object exhibits all of the va lues  )   . An action problem xs likely ~ fIl ) the listener cannot perform the action spec ified by the speaker because of some obstac le  ;   ( 2 ) the hstener performs the action but does not a rrlve at its intended effect  ( I . e . , a spec i f ied or de fau l t const ramt l sn t satisfied  )   ; or ( 3 ) the current action affects a previous ac tion tn an adverse way  , yet the speaker has given no sign of any impor tance to this side-effect  . 
Goal obstacle
A goal obstacle occurs when a goal ( or subgo a\[ ) one is trying to achievets blocked This b lockage can result m confusion for the hs tener because he did not expect the speaker to give him tasks that could not be achieved  . Often . though , it points out for the hstener that some mls communication  ( such as mls reference ) has occurred . 
Goal redundancy
Goal redundancy occurs when the requested goal ( or subgoal ) is already satisfied . In some sense , xtxs a special k lnd of goal obstacle where the goal to be fulfilled is blocked because it is already satisfied  . It is a simple goal obstacle because not hmg has to be done to get around it  . However , it can lead to confusion on misunderstood what the speaker has requested since they wouldn't expect a reasonable speaker Lo request the per formance of an already completed action  . It provides a hint that miscommumcation has occurred  . 
3 Repairing Reference Failures 3 . I Introduction The previous section dlustrated how task-oriented natural language mteract lons in the realworld can induce contextually poor utterances  . Given all the possibilities for confusion , when confusions do occur , they must be resolved If the task is to be perfo rmed  . This section explores the problem of fix ing reference failures  . 
Reference Identification is a search process where a listener looks for something in the world that satisfies a speaker's uttered description  . A comput at lonal scheme for performing reference has evolved from work by other artificial intelligence researchers  ( e . g . , see\[14\]) . That tradlt lonal approach succeeds if a referent ~s found  , or falls d no referent ts found see Figure 3 ( a ) ) . However , a reference identlficatlon component must be more versatile than those constructed m the traditional manner  . The excerpts provided m the prevlous section show that the traditional approach is wrong because people's real behavlor zs much more elaborate  . In particular . 
hsteners often find the correct referent even when the speaker's descrlpt  ) on does not describe any object In the world . For example , a speaker could descrl be a blue block as the " turquoise block  . " Most listeners would goahead and assume that the blue block was the one the speaker meant  . 
A key feature to reference identlficatlon is " negotlatlon  . " Negotlatlon in reference ldentlh catlon comes in two forms  . First . It can occur between the listener and the speaker  . The listener can step back , expand greatly on the speaker's descrlpt lonofa plausible referent  , and ask for conhrmatlon that he has indeed found the correct referent  . For example , a hstener could mlt late negotiation wlth ' T in confused  . 
Are you talking about the thlng that is k lnd of flared at the top ? Couple in cheslong  . It's kind of blue . " Second . negotiation can be wlth oneself . Thls type of negotiation , called self-negotlatl on . Ls the one that we are most concerned wlthin thls research  . The listener conslders aspects of the speaker's descrzptlon  , the context of the commum catlon , and the listener's own abdltles . He then apphes that dehber at lonto determine whether one referent c and l date : s better than another or  . if no candidate Is found , what are the most likely places for error or confuslon  . Such negotlatlon can result in the listener testing whether or not a partlcular referent works  . For example , linguistic descrlptlons can influence a listener 's perception of the world  . The listener must ask himself whether he can percelve one of the oblects in the world the way the speaker described it  . in some cases , the listener's percept lonmay over rule the descrlptlon because the listener can't percelve ~ t the way the speaker described it  . 
To repair the traditional approach we have developed an algorithm that captures forcer tain cases the listener's abdity to negot iate with himself for a referent It can look for a referent and  . If It doesn't find one , it can try to find possible referent c and idates that might work  , and then loosen the speaker's description us ing knowledge about the speaker  , the conversation , and the listener himself . Thus . the reference process becomes multi-step and resumable This computational model  , which I call " FWIM " for " Find What I Mean "   , is more faithful to the data than the tradi tional model  ( see Figure 3 ( b ) ) .

Our reference identlh catlon module treats descriptions as approximate It relaxes a description in order to find a referent when the hteral content of the description falls to provide the needed Information  . Relaxation . however , is not performed blindly on the descript ion We try to model a person's behavior by drawlng on sources of knowledge used by people  . We have developed a computational model that can relax aspects of a descrlptlon using many of these sources of knowledge  . 
Relaxation then becomes a form of commum catlon repair  \[4\] that hearers can use . 
3.2 The relaxation component
When a description fails to denote are ferent In the realworld properly  , It Is possible to repairt t by a relax at l on process that ignores or modifies parts of the descrlptlon  . Since a description can speclfy many features of an object  , the order In which parts of It are relaxed Is crucial  ( i . e . . re lax ing Ln d i f fe rent o rders cou ld y ie ld matches to different objects  ) There are several kinds of relaxation possib le One can ignore a constituent  , replace It with something close , replace it with a related value , or change focus ( i . e . . cons ider a d i f fe rent g roup of ob jec ts .  )  . This section descrlbes the overall relax at loncomponent that draws on knowledge sources about descriptions and the realworld as it tries to relax an errorful description to one for which a referent can be sdent lf ied  . 
3 . 2 . 1 F ind a re ferent us ing a re ference mechamsm Identifying the referent of a description requires finding an element in the world that corresponds to the speaker's descript ion  ( where every feature specified in the descrip tion is present In the element in the world but not necessarily vice versa  )   . The initial task of our reference mechan is mIs to determine whether or not a search of the  ( taxonomic ) knowledge base that we use to model the world Is necessary  . For example , the reference component should not both er searching-unless specifically requested to do so-for a referent for indefinite noun phrases  ( which usually describe new or hypothetical objects  ) or extremely vague descriptions ( which do not clearly describe an oblect because they are composed of imprecise feature values  )  . A number of aspects of discourse pragmattcs can be used in that determination  ( eg . , the use of a delctlc In a definite noun phrase , such as " thls X " or " the last X " , hints that the object was either mentioned prev iously or that it probably was evoked by some previous reference  , and that it is searchable ) but we will not examine them here . 
The knowledge base contains linguistic descriptions and a descrlpt to n of the listener's vlsual scene itself  . In our Implementation and algorithms , we assume It is represented In KL-One\[3\] , a system for describing taxonomic knowledge . KL-One is composed of CONCEPTs , ROLEs on concepts , end links between them . ACONCE PTIs like a set . representing those elements described by it . ASUPERC link (  '==>" ) is used between concepts to show set Inclusion . For example , consider Figure 3 . The SuperC from Concept B to Concept A is like stating BCA for two sets A and BAn INDIVIDUAL CONCEPT ts used to guarantee that the subset speclhed by a concept Isunique The\[ndlvl dual Concept D shownm the figure Is de hned to be a unique member of the subset specified by Concept CROLEs on concepts are like normal attributes and slothllers mother knowledge representation languages  . They define a functlonal relatlons hlp between the concept and other concepts 

CIndividual

Figure 4: AKL-One Taxonomy
Assuming that a search of the knowledge base Is considered necessary  , then a reference search mechanismts revoked . The search mechanism uses the KL-One Class ther \[16\] to search the knowledge base taxonomy . Thls search Is constrained by a focus mechan lsm based on the one developed by Grosz  \[14\]  . 
The Classafler's purpose Is to discover all approprmte ~ ubsumptlon relationships between a newly formed descrlpt to n and all o ther descriptions In agwen taxonomy  . With respect to reference , this means that all possible ( descriptions of ) referents of the descrlptlon will be subsumed by ttafter It has been class Lhed rote the knowledge base taxonomy  . If more than one candidate referent Is below ( when a descrlptlon AIs subsumed by B . we say Ats " below " B ) the classified description , then , unless a quantifier in the description specified more than one element  , the speaker's description is ambiguous . If exactly one descr~ptl on Is below it , then the intended referent is assumed to have been found  . Finally , if no referent is found below the classified descrxption  , the relaxation component is invoked . We will only consider the last case in the res t of the paper  . 
3 . 2 . 2 Col lect votes fo r o r aga ins t re lax ing the description It is necessary to determine whether or not the lack of a referent for a description has to do with the description itself  ( i . e . . re fe rence fa i lu re ) or outside forces that are causing reference confusion  . For example , the problem may be with the flow of the conversation and the speaker's and hsteners perspectives on it  ; it may be due to m correct attachment of a modifier  ; it may be due to the action requested ; and so on . Pragmatic rules are Invoked to decide whether or not the descrxptlon should be relaxed  . These rules will not be discussed here so we will assume that the problem lies in the speakers description  . 
3 . 2 . 3 Per form the re laxat ion of the descr ip t ion If relaxation Is demanded  , then the system must ( 1 ) find potential referent candidates ,   ( 2l determine which features in the speaker ' s description to relax and in what order  , and use those ordered features to order the potential candidates with respect to the pre ferred ordering of features  , and ( 3~ determine the proper re laxat ion techn iques to use and apply them to the description  . 
Find potential referent candidates Beforere laxation can take place  , potential candidates for referents ( which denote elements in the listener's vi sual scene  ) must first be found These candidates are di scovered by performing a " walk " tn the knowledge base taxonomy in the general vlc lm ty of the speakers classified descript ion  . AKL-One partial marcher is used to determme how close the candidate descriptions found during the walk are to the speakers descript ion  , The partial metcher generates a numerical score to represent how well the descrlpt lons match  ( after first generating scores at the feature level to help determme how the features a retobe aligned end how well they match  )  . This score is based on information about KL -One and does not takem to account any informat i on about the task domain  . The ordering of features and candidates for re laxation described below takes Into account the task domain  . 
The set of best descriptions returned by the marcher  ( as determined by some cutoff score ) are selected as referent candidates . 
Order the features and candidates for relax at ion At this peat the reference system inspects the speaker's description and the cand idates  , decides wtltch features to relax and in what order  .   5 and generates a master ordering of features for relaxation  . Once the feature order Is created , the reference system uses 50 fcourse , om = a one ~ rticular candidate is selected . 
then deciding which features to relax is relat ivelytr  ( vial-one simply c ( mporee feature by feature between the candidate description  ( the target ) and the speaker's description ( the ~ ttern ) and notes any discrepancies . 
2 12 that ordering to determine the order in which to try relaxing the candidates  . 
We draw pr ; martly on sources of linguistic knowledge , pragmatic knowledge , discourse knowledge , domam knowledge , perceptual knowledge , hierarchical knowledge , and trial and error knowledge durmg this repair process  . A detailed treatment of all of them can be found In  \[12  ,  27 ,  13\] . These knowledge sources are consulted to determine the feature ordering for relaxation  . We represent information from each knowledge source as a set of relaxation rules  . These rules are written in a PROLOG-Iike language  . Figure 5 illustrates one such linguistic knowledge relaxation rule  . This rule is motivated by the observation in the excerpts that speakers typ ~ cally add more important informatlon at the end of a descrlpt ~ on  ( where they are separated from the ma~npart of the descrlpt ~ on and thus provided more emphasis  )  . Since the syntactic constituents often at the end are relatlve clauses or predicate complements  , we created this more specdic relax at lon rule . However . a more general and more applicable rule is that information presented at the end of a descrlpt lon is usually more promment  .

Figure 5: A sample relaxation rule
Each knowledge source produces ~ tsown partial o rderm g of features  . The partial order mgs are then zntegrated to form ad~rected graph  . For example . 
perceptual knowledge may say to relax color However  . 
~ f the color value was asserted ~ n a relative clause  . 
linguistic knowledge would rank color lower .  ~ . e . .
placmg~t later ~ n the list of things to relax.
Smce different knowledge sources generally have di fferent partial order lngs of features  , these differences can lead to a conflict over which features to relax  . It Is the job of the best candidate algorithm to resolve the d~s agreements among knowledge sources  . 
It's goalts to order the referent candidates , C i , so that relaxation ~ s attempted on the best c and z dates first Those candidates are the ones that conform best to a proposed feature ordering  . To start , the algorithm exammes pairs of candidates and the feature order ~ ngs from each knowledge source  . For each candidate C i . 
the algorithm scores the effect of relaxlng the speaker's orlglnal descrlpt ~ onto Ci  . using the feature ordering from one knowledge source  . The score reflects the goal of mln~mlz:ng the number of features relaxed whale  try3ng to relax the features that are " earhest " sn the feature order mg  . It repeats ~ ts scoring of Ci for each knowledge source  , and sumsup its scores to form Ci's total score . The Ci's are then ordered by that score . 
Figure 6 provides a graphic description of th~s process . A set of objects ~ n the realworld are selected by the partial marcher as potent ~ a candidates for the referent  . These candidates are shown across the top of the figure  . The lines on the right side of each box correspond to the set of features that describe that object  . The speaker's descrlpt ~ onts represented in the center of the figure  . The set of specified features and their as s igned feature value  ( e . g . , the pa i r Co lo r - Maroon ) are also shown there . A set of partial orderings are generated that suggest which features in the speaker's description should be relaxed first- one ordering for each knowledge source  ( shown as " l~nguist ~ c , "" Perceptual . " and " H ~ erarchl caI " in the figure) . These are put together to form a directed graph that represents the possible  , reasonable ways to relax the features specified tn the speakers description  . Finally . the referent candidates are reordered using the information expressed ~ n the speaker's description and in the directed graph of features  .

It stops at the first candidate which zs reasonable  . 
Determine which relaxation methods to apply Relaxation can take place wlth many aspects of a speaker's descrlptlon : wlth complex relatlons specified In the descrlptlon  , wlthind lvl dual features of a referent specified by the descrlptlon  , and with the focus of attention in the realworld where one attempts to find a match  . Complex relatlons speclfted in a speaker's descrlptlon includes patlal relations  ( e . g . .
" the outlet near the top of the tube "> , comparatives ( e . g . " the larger tube ") and superlatlves ( e . g . , " the longest tube ") . These can be relaxed . The slmpler features of an object ( such as slzeor color ) that are speclfied in the speaker's descrlpt to n are also open to relaxation  . 
Often the objects in focus In the real world implicitly cause other objects to be In focus  \[14  ,  2\]\] . 
The subparts of an object ~ n focus , for example , are reasonable candidates for the referent of a fazhng description and should be checked  . At other times , the speaker might attribute features of a subpart of an that Is composed of a red handle  , a metalrod , a blue cap , and agreen cup as " the green plunger ") . In these cases , the relaxation mechanism utilizes the part-whole relation in object descriptions to suggest a way to relax the speaker's description  . 
Relaxation of a description has a few global strategies that can be followed for each part of the description :  ( I ) drop the errorful feature value from the descriptional together  ,   ( 2 ) weaken or tighten the feature value but keep its new value close to the specified one  , or ( S ) try some other feature value . 
These strategies are realized through a set of procedures  ( or reLa = ,   , tion methods ) that are organized hierarchically . Each procedure is an expert at relaxing its particular type of feature  . For example , a Generate-Similar-Feature-Values procedure is composed of procedures llke Generate-Similar -Shape-Values  , Generate-Similar-Color-Values and Generate -Similar-Size-Values  . Each of those procedures are specialists that attempt to first relax the feature value to one " near " the current one  ( e . g . , one would prefer to first relax the color " red " to " pink " before relaxing it to " blue "  ) and then . d that fails , to try relaxing it to any of the other possible values  . If those fail . the feature would simply be ignored . 
3.3 An example on handling a misreference
This section describes how a referent identification system can handle amls reference using the scheme outlined in the previous section  . For the purposes of thls example , assume that the water pump objects currently in focus include the CAP  . the MAINTUBE . the AIRCHAMBER and the STAND ( see Figurela ) for a picture of these parts ) Assume also that the speaker tries to describe two of the objects  . 
" . two devices that are clear piast lcOne of them has two openings on the outside with threads on the end  , and its about five in cheslong . The other onets arounded piece with a turquoise base on it  . Both a retubular . The rounded piece fits loosely over . . . " . The reference system can find a unique referent for the first obJect but not for the second  . The relaxation algorithm will be shown below to reduce the set of referent candidates for the second description down to two  . It . then . requires the system/listener to try out those candidates to determine if one  . or both , fits loosely . The protocols exhibit a similar result when the listener uses " fits loosely " to get the correct referent  ( eg . . Excerpt 6 exemplifies where the " fit " can confirm that the proper referent was found  )   . 
Figure 7 provides a simplified and hnearlzed vlew of the actual KL-One represent at lon of the speaker's descriptions after they have been parsed and semantically interpreted  . A representation of each of the water pump objects that are currently under consideration is presented in Figure  8 Each provides a physical description of the object-in terms of its dimensions  , the basic 3-D shapes composing it , and its physical features - and a basic functional description of the obJect  . The first entry in each representation tn Figure 8 that entry is shown in uppercase ) defines the basic kind of entity being described e  . g . . " TUBE " means that the object being described is some kind of tube  ) The words in mixed case refer to the names of features and the words in uppercase refer to possible fillers of those features from things in the water pump world  . The " Subpart " feature provides a place for an embedded description of an object that is a subpart of a parent object  . Such subparts can be referred to on their own or as part of the parent object  . The " Orientation " feature , used in the representations in Figure 8 . provides a rotation and translation of the object from some standard orientation to the oblects current orientation in  3 -D space . The standard orientation provides a way to define relative positions such as " top  , "" bottom , " or " slde . "

The KL-One Classifier compares the features specified in the speaker's descrip tions  ( Descrl and the " " Outer " feature of Descr2 in Figure T ) with the features speclhed for each element in the EL-One taxonomy that corresponds to one of the current objects of interest in the real world  . Notice that some features are directly comparable  . For example , the " Transparency " feature of Descrl and the " Transparency " feature of MAIN TUBE are both equa lto " CLEAR  . " Other features require further processing before they can be compared  . The OPENING value of " Subpart " in Deecrl is thought of primarily as a  2 -D cross-sectlon ( such as a " hole " )   . while two CYLINDER subparts of MA/NTUBE are v ie we das  13-D   ) cylinders that have the " Function " of being outlets  , i . e . , OUTLET-ATTACHMENT-POINTS . To compare OPENING and CYLINDER , the inference must be made that both things can describe the same thing  ( similar inferences are developed in ( 18 \ ]  )   . One way this inference can occurts by recurs lvely examining the subparts of MA/NTUBE wlth the partial matcher until the cylinders a reexamined at the  2 -D level . At that level , an end of the cylinder will be defined as an OPENING With that examination  , the MAINTUBE can be seen as described by Deeer I . 
Descr2 presents different problems .   Descr2 refers to a nobJect that is supposed to have a subpart that is TURQUOISE  . The Classifier determines that Descr2 could not describe either the CAP or 3TAND because both are BLUE . It also could not describe the MAINTUBE 6 or . a IRCHAMBER since each has subparts that are e it her VIOLET or BLUE  . The Classifier places Descr2 as best it can in the taxonomy , showing no connections between 6Sin?e Deacr ~ refers to ~ AJNTUSE . MAINTUBE could be dropped as ? potential refe rent candidate for  Descr2  . We will . hommver , leave it a eapotential candidate to make th is eso ~ le more coelples  .

The reference mechanism now tries to find potential referent candidates  , using the taxonomy exploration routine described in Section  3  . 2 . 3 . by examining the elements closest to Descr2 In the taxonomy and using the partial matcher to score how close each element is to  Descr2  . 7 The matcher determines MA/NTUBE .

The above analysls using the partial matcher provldes no clear winner smce the differences are so close causing the scores generated for the c and l dates to be almost exactly the same  ( i . e . . the only difference was In the score for Transparency  )  . All candidates . 
hence , will be retained for now.

At this point , the knowledge sources and their associated rules that were ment loned earlier apply  . 
These rules attempt to order the feature values m the speaker's description for relaxation  . First . we'll order the features m DescrZ using lingulst lc knowledge  . 
Linguistic analysls of Deser2," . . . are clear plast lc . . . arounded pace wl that urquoise base . . . Both a retubular . . . fits loosely over . . . . " tells us that the features were specified using the following modifiers  . 
oA dlect ~ ve: ( Shape ROUND ) o P repositional Phrase: ( Subpart ( BASE ( Color
TURQUOISE ) ) ) o Predicate Complement : ( Transparency CLEAR )  , I Composltion PLASTIC ) , ( Analogl cal-Shape
TUBULAR ), ( Fit LOOSE)
Observations from the protocols ( as described by the rules developed In\[13\] ) has shown that people tend to relax first features specified as adlectlves  , then as preposlt lonal phrases and finally as relative clauses or predicate complements  . Thls suggests relaxation of
Descr2 in the order : \] Shape < Color . Subport < Tronsporency . COmpOSit ; on . Analogical-Sha De , F ; t The set of features on the left side of a "<" symbol is relaxed before the set on the rlght side The order that the features inside the braces  . ") ~", are relaxed is left unspecified i . e . , any order of relaxation Is alrlght ) Perceptual Information about the domain also provldes suggest lons  . Whenever a feature has feature values that are close  , the none should be pared to relax any of them to any of the others  ( we call thls the " clustered feature value rule " ) \[ nthls example . 
smce the colors are all very close-BLUE . TURQUOISE , and VIOLET-then Color may be a reasonable thing to relax  . Hxerarchl cal Information about how closely related one feature value Is to another can also be used to determine what to relax  . The Shape values are a good example . A CYLINDAL shape Is also a CONICAL shape , which Is also a 3-DROUND shape . Hence . It Is very reasonable to match ROUNDED to CYLINDRICAL  . All of these suggestions can be put together to form the order : ~ Sho~e  . Co ~ or < ~ Su ~ l ) art ~< Trangpore flcy , Composition . 
Anaogica I--Shope . Fi I:.
The referent c and l dates MAIN TUBE . STAND , and . 4 1R CHAMBER can be examined and possibly ordered for relaxation using the above feature ordering For this example  , the relaxation of Descr2 to any of the candidates requires relaxing their SHAPE and COLOR features  . Since they each require reiaxmg the same features  , the candidates cannot be ordered w , th respect to each other ( i . e . , none of the possible feature orders is better for relaxing the candidates  )  . Hence . 
no one candidate stands out as the most likely referent  . 
While no order lng of the candidates was posslble.
the order generated to relax the features In the speaker's description can be used to guide the relaxation  , of each candl date . The relaxation methods mentioned at the end of the last section come Into use here  . Generate-Simdar-Shape-Values can determine that HEMISPHERICAL and CYLIND RICAL shapes of the AIRCHAMBER are close to the  3D-ROUND shape . . This holds equa l ly t rue for the cyhndr lca l shapes of the MAINTUBE and the STAND  . Generate-Similar-Color-Values next t rms relaxing the Color TURQUOISE  . It determmes the colors BLUE and GREEN as the best alternates  . Here only two clear winners exist-the AIR CHAMBER and the STAND-while the MAINTUBE is dropped as a candidate smce it Is reasonable to relaxTURQUOISE to BLUE or to GREEN but not to VIOLET Subpart  , Transparency , Analogl cal-Shape , and Composition provide no further help though . the fact that the AIRCHAMBER has both CLEAR and OPAQUE subparts mg ht put it slightly lower than the ST  , hVD whose subparts are all CLEAR . Thls difference . 
however , is not slgndicant . ) . Thls leavestrial and error attempts to try to complete the FIT action  . The one ( if any ) that fits - and fits loosely-Is selected as the referent  . The protocols showed that people often do just that-reducing their set of choices down as best they can and then taking each of the remaln mg chmces and trying out the requested action on them  4 Conclusion Our goalm thls work Is to budd robust natural language understanding systems  , allow mg them to detect and avold mls communl catlon  . The goal is not to make a perfect listener but a more tolerant one that could avold many mistakes  , though still wrong on occasion . In Section 2 , wemtroduced a taxonomy of mls communl catlon problems that occur tn expert-apprentice dialogues  . We showed that reference mistakes are one kind of obstacle to robust communication  . To tackle reference problems , we descrlbed how to extend the succeed/fad paradigm followed by previous natural language researchers We represented realworld objects hler arc hl call v in a knowledge base using a representation language  , KL-One . that follows in the tradition of semant lc networks and frames  . In such a represent at lonframe work , the reference identification task looks for are ferent by comparing the representation of the speakers Input to elements in the knowledge base by using a matching procedure  . Failure to find a referent in previous reference identlh cat lonsystems resulted In the unsuccessful termination of the reference task We claim that people behave better than this and exphcltly illustrated such cases in an expert -apprent lce domain about to y water pumps  . 
We developed a theory of relaxation for recovering from reference failures that provides a much better model for human performance  . When people are asked to identify objects , they go about it macertain way . f lnd candidates , adjust as necessary , retry , and , if necessary , gl ve up an dask for help . We claim that relaxation is an Integral part of this process and that the particular parameters of relaxation differ from task to task and person to person  . Our work models the relaxation process and provldes a computatlonal model for experimenting w ~ th the different parameters  . The theory incorporates the same language and physical knowledge that people usem performing reference identification to guide the relaxation process  . Thls knowledge Is represented as a set of rules and as data mahierarchical knowledge base  . Rule-based relaxation provided a methodical way to use knowledge about language and the world to find a referent  . The hlererchx cal representation made It posslble to tackle issues of Imprecls lon and overspecification In a speakers description  . It allows one to check the position of a description in the hierarchy and to use that position to fudge Im precision and over-specl f ication and to suggest possible repairs to the descriptlon  . 

Interestingly . one would expect that " closest " match would suffice to solve the problem of finding a referent  . We showed , however , that it doesn't usually provide you with the correct referent  . Closest match isn't sufficient because there are many features associated wl than object and  , thus . determimng whlch of those features to keep and which to drop Is a difficult problem due to the combinator lcs and the effects of context  . The relaxation method described circumvents the problem by using the knowledge that people have about language and the physical world to prune down the search space  .
