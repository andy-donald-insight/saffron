The quss tlun of how people resolve pronouns has the various factors combine  . 
been of interest to language theorists for along time because so much of what goes on when people find referents for pronouns seems to lie at the heart of comprehension  . However , despite the relevance of pronouns for comprehension and language cheor T  , the processes chat contribute to pronoun resolution have proved notoriously difficult Co pin down  . 
Part of the difficulty arises from the wide range offac=ors that can affect which antecedent noun phrase in a tex ~ is us derstood to be co -referent lal with a particular pronoun  . These factors can range from simple number/gender agreement through selectional rescrlc ~ ions co quite complex " knowledge chat has been acquired from the CaxC  ( see Webber ,   ( 1978 ) for an eatly illustrated description of many of these factors  )  . Research in psychology , artificial intelligence a ~ d linguistics has gone a long way toward identifying some of these factors and their role in pronoun resolu ~ ion  . For instance , in psychology , research carried ou C by Caramazza = - dhis colleagues  ( Caramazza et el ,  1977 ) as well as research chat I have dune ( E h r l l c h ,  1980) , has demuns ~ rated that number/sender agreement really c = - fumc ciunto constrain the choice of referent in a way Chat signifl cantly facilltaCes processing  . Within an AI framework , there has been some very interesting work carried out by Sidner  ( 1977 ) m ~ d Grosz ( 1977 ) thac seeks to identify the current topic of a Cex1: and coshow Chat knowledge of the topic can considerably sillily pronoun reso-lutlon  . 
It is important that people areable coselect appropriate referents for pronouns and cohave some basis for that decision  . The research discussed so far has mentioned some of the factors Chac contribute cochose decisiuns  . However , part of ~ he problem of really understanding how people resolve pronouns is knowing how 
Certainly it is important a ~ duseful to poln c to a particular factor as concri-butlng to a reference decision  , but in many texts more than one of these factors will be available to a reader or listener  . One problem for the theorist is then to explaln which factor predominates in the decision as well as to describe the scheduling of evaluacl on procedures  . If it could be shown that there was a stricc ordering in which tests were applied  , say , number/gender agreement followed by selection ai restrictions followed by inference procedures  , pronoun resolucl on may be simpler to explain . At our present level of knowledge it is dlfficul c to discern ordering principles chat have any degree of generality  . For Instance , for every example where the topic seems to determine choice  , as in Lilar example c~-often be found where the more recent antecedent is preferred over the one that forms part of the topic  . Moreover , even this claim begs the quesclon of how the coplc can be identified unambiguously  . 
A different approach is possible . The process of assigning a referent Coapronoun c~m be viewed as utilizing two kinds of strategies  . One strategy is concerned with selecting the best referent from amongst the candidates available  . The ocher strategy is concerned with searching through memory for the candidates  . 
These two types of strategy , which will be referred to msem?-lically as inference and search strategies  , have different kinds of characteristics . A search strategy dictates the order in which c and l daces are evaluated  , but has no machinery for carrying out the evaluation  . 
The inference strategy helps to set up the represen-taclon of the information in the cexC againsc which can-dl dacas can be evaluated  , but has ~ oway of finding the c~aldidates . ~ n the rest of this paper , she way these stra Cegles ~ igh c interact will be explored and the results of two studies will be reported that bear on One possible search strategy is ~ o examine candidates serially beginning with the one men Kioned most recently and working back through the text  . This strategy makes some sense because , as Hobbs (1978) has pointed out , most pronouns corefer with antecedents Chat were menr  . laned within the last few senuences . 
Thus , a serial search s~rategy provides a principled way of rescric ~ Lnghow a text is searched  . Moreover , there is some evidence fro ~ psychological research ~ hatit takes longer to resolve pronouns when the antecedent wlch which the pronotn ~ corefers is far rather than near the pronoun  ( e . g . Clark & $ engul , 1979; Sprln Eston , 1975) . Although such distance effects have been used to argue for differences in memory reErieval  , wlCh the nearer antecedents be in 8 easier to retrieve Ch ~ the further ones , none of the reported data rule out a serial search strategy  . 
A Sargued earlier , a search s~rar ~ Eyalone cannot ae coun ~ for pronoun resolu Lian because it lacks any machinery for evaluation  . There are , however , many kinds of informa ~ io ~ tha ~ people ~ bring to bear when evaluating c~dida~es and some of these were discussed earlier  . A c ~ on method is to decide between alder-native candidates on ~ he basis of information gained through inferences  . Inference is a rather u ~ i qui ~ ous and often ill -deflned no ~ ion  , and , although it is beyond the scope of this paper to clarify the concept  , it is worth no ~ ing ~ hatChore are ( at leas ~ ) ~ wo kinds of inference chat play a role in anaphora generally  . One kind which T will call ' lexl cal ' inferences are  . drawn to establish Chatt ~ o different linguls ~ ic expressions refer ~ o ~ he same entity  . For insnance , in the following pair of sentences from Garrod and Sanford  ( 1977 ) :  ( I ) A buscameroaring round the corner The vehicle nearly flattened apedes ~ rlana ' lexlcal ' inference esuabll shest hat ~ he particular vehiclement luned in ~ he second sentence is in fact a bus  . Tnferences can also be drawn to support the selection of one referent over another  . In a sentence such as: ( 2 ) Johnsold a carto Fred because he needed it a series of inferences based in part an out knowledge of selling a ~ dneeding  , supports ~ he selection of Fred rather ~ h = mJohn as referent for the pronoun " he "  . In the experiments to be reported , it was ' lexical ' inferences ra~her ~ hanthe oCher kind that were manipulated  . 
Subjects in ~ he experiment were asked to read texts such as the a ~ e given below:  ( 3 ) Fred was outside all day
John was inside all day a ) He had a sleep inside after lunch b ) He had a sleep in his room after lunch and then immed la ~ elyafter  , answer a question such as '~ dho had a sleep after lunch Y " Chat was designed to elicit the referent of the pranou ~ in ~ helas ~ sentence  . 
Two factors were independently varied . The antecedent could be near or far from the pronoun  , ~ helacier affected by switching the order of the first ? wosen-~ences  . The second factor was whether a ' bridg~Ing ' inference had to be drw ~ n ~ oes ~ chllsh coreference bed  , sen part of the predl ca~e of the lasc sentence and ~ he target sentence  . The ~ oversions , ( a ) no inference and ( b ) inference , are shown as alternative ~ hird sen-canoes in example  ( 3 ) -hove . The principal measures were ~ he Lime to answer ~ he question and ~ heaccuracy of ~ here spunse  . 
The experi-~ent addresses ~ wo critical issues . One is whether ~ he'lewical'inference is dr Ed nas part of the evalua Lion procedure  , or , whether it is drawn independently of Cha ~ process  . The o~her issue concerns the search sura ~ eEy itself : do subjects examine can-dl da~es serially  , and , if so , do they s~illuse oCher criteria to reject the first canal/dace and choose the second ? Two dlstincc models of processing can be con-s~rucced from a conslderarion of Chess issues  . In the case where inferences are triggered by the need ~ o  9O evaluate a candidate , any effect due to extra processing should be unaffected by whether the antecedent ks near or far from the pronoun  . In either case the inference will be drawn in response to r/Reneed to decide on the acceptability of the candidate  . In the second model , the inference is triggered by the anaphoric expression  , e . g . " in his room " An the third sentence , and the need to relate chatexpression to the location " inside " mentioned in a previous sentence  . The inference is expected to take a certain a motmt of time to be drawn  ( cf . Kintsch , 1974) . According to the second model , one would expect that in cases where the antecedent is near the pronoun  , there will be some effect due to inference because the process may not be completed in time to answer the question  . When the antecedent is far from the pronoun , however , the inference process will be completed and hence no effect of inference should still be detected  . The two models assume rationality on the part of the subjects  ; that is , they assume that subjects will accurately select the further antecedent where appropriate even though recency would predict selecr  . lon of the first candidate that is evaluated . If this assumption ks valid , subjects should select the far antecedent where appropriate mere often than the  ( erroneous ) near candidate . 
The results of the experiment , shown An Table 1 , support the second model ; ' lexlcal ' inferences are drawn only once and in response to an anaphoric expression  . The data also provide evidence of a serial search strategy by showing that there are more errors and longer latencles associated with far rather than near antecedents  . The data further show that even when the correct choice is far from the pronoun  , subjects will choose it in preference to ~ he nearer condidate  , thus demonstrating that a serial search strategy alone cannot predict the choice of referent  . 
The inferences that subjects had to draw in this experiment concerned simple lexlcal relations  . The increase in latency due to having drawn such an inference supports the resul~s of earlier studies  , par-tlcularly those of Garrod and Sanford (1977) . Whac the present study fails to do , however , is to determine whether that inference ks drawn spontaneously  , while reading . Previous research ( e . g . , ~ intsch ,  1974 , Garrodald Sanford ,  1977 ) has shown ~ hat inferences are more likely to be drawn while reading ~ hanata response stage  . It was thus of some interest to know when ~ he lexical inferences in ~ he present study were drawn  . 
This issue was examined by modifying the previous experiment to include both an additional measure of reading time and a  1  . 5s delay between presentation and test . 
The latter modification is important since if subjects are drawing inferences while reading  , ~ he process may not be completed by the time the question is a skedi~mned lately after presentation  . The introduction of a delay also allows for a further test of the two pro-ceasing modeled outlined earlier  . If indeed ' lexlcal ' inferences are drawn to establish coreference between anaphoric expressions rather than to determine pronominal reference  , as the previous experiment indicated , then there should be an effect of inference on reading ~ ime but not at response when there is a delay  , because by response ~ he inference should have been dr~m  . The data were consistent with this hypothesis . However , what also emerged from the second study was that only some of ~ hepassages seemed to elicit inferences at reading  ; the number of passages was increased in the second experiment rocorn % tar possible repetition effects  . In fact , for half the passages subjects res-ponded by saying there was no answer  . An example of such a passage is given below : ( 4 ) Jill had a newspaper in the living-room
An n had a book in the living-room
Sheread some chemistry An the evening
It was also the case for these passages that the inferences did not seem to be drawn while reading but rather in response to the question  . There is some doubthere about cause and effect , nevertheless , the cerning wha~triggers an inference to be drawn  . One answer , supplied by Garrod & Sanfordin ~ heir experi -ment  . s , is thac a relation baleen e ~ c pressio as muse some h ~ be perceived before an inference is drawn to de ~ e~-mlne ~ enature of ~ he relation  . I~no~her words , people do not draw inferences randomly to relate lln-8uisuic expressions . Thus , whereas Garrod & $ anford found ~ ha ~ subjects would infer coreference between " bus " and " vehicle " in exa~le  ( i )  , they failed to make that connection , qui ~ rightly , in aslnu Llar passage shown below : ( 5 ) A buscameroaring round the corner
It nearly smashed some vehicles
What kinds of strategies do readers a dop ~ when they search ~ heir memory to find plausible referents for pronouns ? Resul~s of che experiments reported here point ~ oa strategy in which an ~ ities are examined serially from ~ he pronoun  . The purpose of a serial search strategy is to provide a principled  we7 in which readers can ex " rn ' In e ~ ho ~ e entities they have stored in mmory  , for ~ heir appropriateness as ~ he referent of a particular prono ~- ~  . The strategy is ~ hus unnecessary when there is only one emr/~y in memory by vlr ~ ue of sim ~ le criteria such as humor and gender agreement wi~h ~ he pronoun  . What cons ~ . It utes ' simple ' criteria is , of course , an open question ; cheans wer , however , will materially affect ~ heapplicab ility of ~ he searchs ~ rategy  . 
The ~ t important part of reference resolution is , however , deciding on the referent . A serial search strategy has no machinery for evaluating candidates  , i ~ can only direct ~ he order in which candidates are examined  . The process of selecting a plausible referent depends on ~ he inferences a reader has drawn while ~ he ~ ext is read  . Thus , when subjects found i ~ hard ~ oselec ~ a referent at all ~ hey also failed to drawm ~ my inferences while ~ heyread ~ he ~ ext  . Moreover , because ~ he inferences for ~ hese passa8es did seem to be drawn in response to a question ellci ~ Ing ~ he referent  , ~ hei , ~llcar A on is that inferences for checle arer material are generally drawn spontaneously and before a specific need for ~ he informar  . lonarises . One can conjecture from ~ hese data that the select_i on of plausible refer-an~s is dependent on how well a reader has understood ~ he preceding text  . If inferences are not drawn on ~ il a specific need arises  , such as finding a referent , ~ henit may be too late , to selec ~ a referent easily or accurately , l  ~ us , reference can also be viewed in terms of what a ~ extmakes available for anaphoric reference  ( cf . Webber , 1978) . 
The picture of pronoun resolution that emerges from the studies reported here  , is one in which effects of distance between the pronoun and its antecedent may play some role  , not as a predicator of pronominal reference as has often been ~ hou Eht  , but as part of a search strate E y . The recertainly are cases where nearer antecedents seem to be preferred over ones further back in the text  ; however , it is more profitable to look ~ o concepts such as foreground in E  ( of . Chafe ,  1974 ) rather than silnple recency for explanations of the preference  . 
? It is also of some interest to have shown that inferences ~ my con ~ rlbute ~ opronoun resolution huc drawn for other reasons  .
