This paper presents SemFrame , a system that induces frame semantic verb classes from WordNet and LDOCE  . Semantic frames are thought to have significant potential in resolving the paraphrase problem challenging many language-based applications  . 
When compared to the handcrafted
FrameNet , SemFrame achieves its best recall precision balance with  83  . 2% recall ( based on SemFrame's coverage of
FrameNet frames ) and 73 . 8% precision ( based on SemFrame verbs ? semantic relatedness to frame-evoking verbs  )  . The next best performing semantic verb classes achieve  56  . 9% recall and 55 . 0% precision . 
1 Introduction
Semantic content can almost always be expressed in a variety of ways  . Lexical synonymy ( She esteemed him highly vs . She respected him greatly ) , syntactic variation ( John paid the bill vs . 
The bill was paid by John ) , overlapping meanings ( Annaturned at Elm vs . Annarounded the corner at Elm ) , and other phenomena interact to produce a broad range of choices for most language generation tasks  ( Hirst , 2003; Rinaldi et al , 2003; Kozlowski et al ,  2003) . At the same time , natural language understanding must recognize what remains constant across paraphrases  . 
The paraphrase phenomenon affects many computational linguistic applications  , including information retrieval , information extraction , question-answering , and machine translation . For example , documents that express the same content using different linguistic means should typically be retrieved for the same queries  . 
Information sought to answer a question needs to be recognized no matter how it is expressed  . 
Semantic frames ( Fillmore , 1982; Fillmore and Atkins ,  1992 ) address the paraphrase problem through their slot -and-filler templates  , representing frequently occurring , structured experiences . 
Semantic frame types of an intermediate granularity have the potential to fulfill an interlingua role within a solution to the paraphrase problem  . 
Until now , semantic frames have been generated by hand ( as in Fillmore and Atkins ,  1992) , based on native speaker intuition ; the FrameNet project ( http://www . icsi . berkeley . edu/~framenet ; Johnson et al ,  2002 ) now couples this generation with empirical validation  . Only recently has this project begun to achieve relative breadthinits inventory of semantic frames  . To have a comprehensive inventory of semantic frames  , however , we need the capacity to generate semantic frames semiautomatically  ( the need for manual postediting is assumed )  . 
To address these challenges , we have developed SemFrame , a system that induces semantic frames automatically  . Overall , the system performs two primary functions : ( 1 ) identification of sets of verb senses that evoke a common semantic frame  ( in the sense that lexical units call forth corresponding conceptual structures  )  ; and ( 2 ) identification of the conceptual structure of semantic frames  . This paper explores the first task of identifying frame semantic verb classes  . These classes have several types of uses . First , they are the basis for identifying the internal structure of the frame proper  , asset for thin Green and Dorr ,  2004 . 
Second , they may be used to extend FrameNet.
Third , they support applications needing access to sets of semantically related words  , for example , text segmentation and word sense disambiguation , as explored to a limited degree in Green ,  2004 . 
Section 2 presents related research efforts on developing semantic verb classes  . Section 3 summarizes the features of WordNet ( http://www . cogsci . princeton . edu/~wn ) and
LDOCE ( Procter ,  1978 ) that support the automatic induction of semantic verb classes  , definitions and example sentences often mention while Section  4 sets forth the approach taken by their participants using semantic-type-like nouns  , SemFrame to accomplish this task . Section 5 thus mapping easily to the corresponding frame presents a brief synopsis of SemFrame?s results  , element . Corpus data , however , are more likely while Section 6 presents an evaluation of to include instantiated participants  , which may SemFrame?s ability to identify semantic verb not generalize to the frame element  . Second , classes of a FrameNet-like nature . Section 7 lexical resources provide a consistent amount of summarizes our work and motivates directions for data for word senses  , while the amount of data in further development of SemFrame  . a corpus for word senses is likely to vary widely . 
2 Previous Work
The EAGLES ( 1998 ) report on semantic encoding differentiates between two approaches to the development of semantic verb classes : those based on syntactic behavior and those based on semantic criteria  . 
Levin ( 1993 ) groups verbs based on an analysis of their syntactic properties  , especially their ability to be expressed in diathesis alternations  ; her approach reflects the assumption that the syntactic behavior of a verb is determined in large part by its meaning  . Verb classes at the bottom of Levin?s shallow network group together  ( quasi- ) synonyms , hierarchically related verbs , and antonyms , alongside verbs with looser semantic relationships  . 
The verb categories based on Pantel and Lin ( 2002 ) and Lin and Pantel ( 2001 ) are induced automatically from a large corpus , using an unsupervised clustering algorithm , based on syntactic dependency features . The resulting clusters contain synonyms , hierarchically related verbs , and antonyms , as well as verbs more loosely related from the perspective of paraphrase  . 
The handcrafted WordNet ( Fellbaum , 1998a ) uses the hyperonymy/hyponymy relationship to structure the English verb lexicon into a semantic network  . Each collection of a toplevel node supplemented by its descendants may be seen as a semantic verb class  . 
In all fairness , resolution of the paraphrase problem is not the explicit goal of most efforts to build semantic verb classes  . However , they can process some paraphrases through lexical synonymy  , hierarchically related terms , and antonymy . 
3 Resources Used in SemFrame
We adopt an approach that relies heavily on preexisting lexical resources  . Such resources have several advantages over corpus data in identifying semantic frames  . First , both Third , lexical resources provide their data in a more systematic fashion than do corpora  . 
Most centrally , the syntactic arguments of the verbs used in a definition often correspond to the semantic arguments of the verb being defined  . 
For example , Table 1 gives the definitions of several verb senses in LDOCE that evoke the 
COMMERCIAL TRANSACTION frame , which includes as its semantic arguments a Buyer , a Seller , some Merchandise , and Money . Words corresponding to the Money ( money , value ) , the Merchandise ( property , goods ) , and the Buyer ( buyer , buyers ) are present in , and to some extent shared across , the definitions ; however , no words corresponding to the Seller are present . 
VerbLDOCE Definition sense buy 1 to obtain ( something ) by giving money ( or something else of value ) buy 2 to obtain in exchange for something , often something of great value buy 3 to be exchangeable for purchase 1 to gain ( something ) at the cost of effort , suffering , or loss of something of values ell1 to give up ( property or goods ) to another for money or other values ell 2 to offer ( goods ) for salesell 3 to be bought ; get a buyer or buyers ; gain a sale
Table 1. LDOCE Definitions for Verbs
Evoking the COMMERCIAL TRANSACTION FrameOf available machine-readable dictionaries  , LDOCE appears especially useful for this research  . It uses a restricted vocabulary of about 2000 words in its definitions and example sentences , thus increasing the likelihood that words with closely related meanings will use

SemFrame gathers evidence about frame semantic relatedness between verb senses by analyzing LDOCE and WordNet data from a variety of perspectives  . The overall approach used is shown in Figure 1 . The first stage of processing extracts pairs of LDOCE and WordNet verb senses that potentially evoke the same frame  . By exploiting many different clues to semantic relatedness  , we overgenerate these pairs , favoring recall ; subsequent stages improve the precision of the resulting data  . 
Figures 2 and 3 give details of the algorithms for extracting verb pairs based on different types of evidence  . These include : clustering LDOCE verb senses /WordNet synsets on the basis of words in their definitions and example sentences  ( fig .  2) ; relating LDOCE verb senses defined in terms of the same verb  ( fig . 3a ) ; relating LDOCE verb senses that share a common stem  ( fig . 3b ) ; extracting explicit sense-linking relationships in LDOCE  ( fig . 3c ) ; relating verb senses that share general or specific subject field codes in LDOCE  ( fig . 3d ) ; and extracting ( direct or extended ) semantic relationships in WordNet ( fig . 3e ) . 
In the second stage , mapping between membership ) exceed a threshold are merged together , thus reducing the number of verb sense groups . The verb senses within each resulting group are hypothesized to evoke the same semantic frame and constitute a frame set  .

We explored a range of thresholds in the final stage of the algorithm  . In general , the lower the 1 threshold , the looser the verb grouping . The number of verb senses retained ( out of 12 , 663 non-phrasal verb senses in LDOCE ) and the verb sense groups produced by using these thresholds are recorded in Table  2  . 
6 Evaluation
One of our goals is to produce sets of verb senses capable of extending FrameNet's coverage while requiring reasonably little postediting  . This goal has two subgoals : identifying new frames and identifying additional lexical units that evoke

We use the handcrafted FrameNet , which is of reliably high precision , as a gold standard for the initial2 evaluation of SemFrame's ability to achieve these subgoals  . For the first , we evaluate SemFrame?s ability to generate frames that correspond to FrameNet?s frames  , reasoning that the system must be able to identify a large proportion of known frames if the quality of its output is good enough to identify new frames  .   ( At this stage we do not measure the quality of new frames  . ) For the second subgoal we can be more concrete : For frames identified by both systems  , we measure the degree to which the verbs identified by SemFrame can be shown to evoke those frames  , even if FrameNet has not identified them as frame -evoking verbs  . 
FrameNet includes hierarchically organized frames of varying levels of generality : Some semantic areas are covered by a general frame  , some by a combination of specific frames , and some by a mix of general and specific frames . 
Because of this variation we determined the degree to which SemFrame and FrameNet overlap by automatically finding and comparing corresponding frames instead of fully equivalent frames  . Frames correspond if the semantic scope of one frame is included within the semantic For the clustering algorithm used  , the clustering FrameNet's frames are more syntactically  than1 threshold range is open-ended . The values semantically motivated ( e . g . , EXPERIENCER-OBJECT , investigated in the evaluation are fairly low . EXPERIENCER-SUBJECT ) . 
Certain constraints imposed by FrameNet's2 development strategy restrict its use as a fullfledged gold standard for evaluating semantic frame induction  . 
(1) As of summer 2003 , only 382 frames had been identified within the FrameNet project  .   ( 2 ) Low recall affects not only the set of semantic frames identified by FrameNet  , but also the sets of frame-evoking units listed for each frame  . No verbs are listed for 38 . 5% of FrameNet's frames , while another 13 . 1% of them list only 1 or 2 verbs . The comparison here is limited to the 197 FrameNet frames for which at least one verb is listed with a counterpart in LDOCE  . (3) Some of a .

Two of the verbs ? a dorn their frames . Instead , correspondence between and decorate ? are shared . In addition , the frame FrameNet and SemFrame frames is established names are semantically related through a using either of two somewhat indirect approaches  . WordNet synset consisting of decorate , a dorn In the first approach , a SemFrame frame is ( which Cat Var relates to ADORNING )  , grace , deemed to correspond to a FrameNet frame if the or nament  ( which Cat Var relates to two frames meet both a minimal-overlap ORNAMENTATION  )  , embellish , and beautify . The criterion ( i . e . , there is some , perhaps small , two frames are therefore designated as overlap between the FrameNet and SemFrame corresponding frames by meeting both the framesets  ) and a frame-name-relatedness minimal-overlap and the frame-name relatedness criterion  . The minimal-overlap criterion is met if criteria . 
either of two conditions is met : ( 1 ) If the In the second approach , a SemFrame frame is FrameNet frame lists four or fewer verbs  ( true of deemed to correspond to a FrameNet frame if the over one-third of the FrameNet frames that list two frames meet either of two relatively stringent associated verbs  )  , minimal overlap occurs when verb overlap criteria  , the majority-match criterion any one verb associated with the FrameNet frame or the majority-related criterion  , in which case matches a verb associated with a SemFrame examination of frame names is unnecessary  .

( 2 ) If the FrameNet framelists five or The majority -match criterion is met if the set more verbs  , minimal overlap occurs when two or of verbs shared by FrameNet and SemFrame more verbs in the FrameNet frame are matched by framesets account for half or more of the verbs in verbs in the SemFrame frame  . either frameset . For example , the APPLY_HEAT The looseness of the minimal overlap frame in FrameNet includes  22 verbs : bake , criterion is tightened by also requiring that the blanch  , boil , braise , broil , brown , char , coddle , names of the FrameNet and SemFrame frames be cook  , fry , grill , microwave , parboil , poach , roast , closely related . Establishing this frame-names aute , scald , simmer , steam , steep , stew , and relatedness involves identifying individual to as t  , while the BOILING frame in SemFrame components of each frame name and augmenting includes  7 verbs : boil , coddle , jug , parboil , 3 this set with morphological variants from CatVar poach  , see the , and simmer . Five of these ( Habash and Dorr 2003) . The resulting set for verbs ? boil , coddle , parboil , poach , and each FrameNet and SemFrame frame name is simmer ? are shared across the two frames and then searched in both the noun and verb WordNet constitute over half of the SemFrame frames et  .

synsets corresponding to the frame names . If the The majority-related criterion is met if half or resulting set of synsets gathered for a FrameNet more of the verbs from the SemFrame frame are frame name intersects with the set of synsets semantically related to verbs from the FrameNet gathered for a SemFrame frame name  , the two frame ( that is , if the precision of the SemFrame frame names are deemed to be semantically verb set is at least  0  . 5) . To evaluate this criterion , related . each FrameNet and SemFrame verb is associated For example  , the FrameNet ADORNING frame with the WordNet verb synsets it occurs in  , contains 17 verbs : a dor n , blanket , cloak , coat , augmented by the synsets to which the initial sets cover  , deck , decorate , dot , encircle , envelop , of synsets are directly related . If the sets of festoon , fill , film , line , pave , stud , and wreathe . synsets corresponding to two verbs share one or The SemFrame ORNAMENTATION frame contains more synsets  , the two verbs are deemed to be 12 verbs : a dorn , caparison , decorate , embellish , semantically related . This process is extended embroider , garl and , garnish , gild , grace , hang , one further level , such that a SemFrame verb found by this process to be semantically related to a SemFrame verb  , whose semantic relationship to a FrameNet verb has already been established  , will also be designated a frame-evoking verb . If half or more of the verbs listed for a SemFrame frame are established as evoking the same frame as the list of WordNet verbs  , then the FrameNet AllSem Frame frames are nouns  . ( See3Green and Dorr , 2004 for an explanation of their selection . ) FrameNet frame names ( e . g . , ABUNDANCE , ACTIVITY_START , CAUSE_TO_BE_WET , INCHOATIVE_ATTACHING ) , however , exhibit considerable variation . 
and SemFrame frames are hypothesized to bound on the task  , i . e . ,  100% recall and 100% correspond through the majority-related criterion  . precision . The Lin & Pantel results are here a For example , the FrameNet ABUND ANCE lower bound for automatically induced semantic frame includes  4 verbs : crawl , swarm , teem , and verb classes and probably reflect the limitations of throng  . The SemFrame FLOW frame likewise using only corpus data  . Among efforts to develop includes 4 verbs : pour , teem , stream , and semantic verb classes , SemFrame?s results pullulate . Only one verb ? teem ? is shared , so correspond more closely to semantic frames than the majority-match criterion is not met  , nor is the do others . 
related-frame-name criterion met , as the frame names are not semantically related . The majority-related criterion , however , is metthrough a WordNet verb synset that includes pour  , swarm , stream , teem , and pullulate . 
Of the 197 FrameNet frames that include at least one LDOCE verb  ,   175 were found to have a corresponding SemFrame frame  . But this 88 . 8% recall level should be balanced against the precision ratio of SemFrame verb framesets  . 
After all , we could get 100% recall by listing all verbs in every SemFrame frame  . 
The majority-related function computes the precision ratio of the SemFrame frame for each pair of FrameNet and SemFrame frames being compared  . By modifying the minimum precision threshold , the balance between recall and precision , as measured using Fscore , can be investigated . The best balance for the SemFrame version is based on a clustering threshold of  2  . 0 and a minimum precision threshold of 0 . 4, which yields a recall of 83 . 2% and overall precision of 73 . 8% . 
To interpret these results meaningfully , one would like to know if SemFrame achieves more FrameNet-like results than do other available verb category data  , more specifically the 258 verb classes from Levin , the 357 semantic verb classes of WordNet 1 . 7 . 1 , or the 272 verb clusters of Lin and Pantel , as described in Section 2 . 
For purposes of comparison with FrameNet , Levin?s verb class names have been hand-edited to isolate the word that best captures the semantic sense of the class  ; the name of a WordNet-based frame is taken from the words for the root-level synset  ; and the name of each Lin and Pantel cluster is taken to be the first verb in the cluster  . 4 Evaluation results for the best balance between recall and precision  ( i . e . , the maximum Fscore ) of the four comparisons are summarized in Table 3 . FrameNet itself constitutes the upper Semantic verb Precision Recall Precision classes threshold at maxF score 
SemFrame 0.40 0.832 0.738

WordNet 0.15 0.528 0.466
Lin & Pantel 0.15 0.472 0.407
Table 3. Best Recall Precision Balance
When Compared with FrameNet 7 Conclusions and Future Work We have demonstrated that sets of verbs evoking a common semantic frame can be induced from existing lexical tools  . In a head-to-head comparison with frames in FrameNet  , the frame semantic verb classes developed by the SemFrame approach achieve a recall of  83  . 2% and the verbs listed for frames achieve a precision of  73  . 8% ; these results far outpace those of other semantic verb classes  . On a practical level , a large number of frame semantic verb classes have been identified  . Associated with clustering threshold 1 . 5 are 1421 verb classes , averaging 14 . 1 WordNet verb synsets . Associated with clustering threshold 2 . 0 are 1563 verb classes , averaging 6 . 6 WordNet verb synsets . 
Despite these promising results , we are limited by the scope of our input data set  . While LDOCE and WordNet data are generally of high quality  , the relative sparseness of these resources has an adverse impact on recall  . In addition , the mapping technique used for picking out corresponding word senses in WordNet and LDOCE is shallow  , thus constraining the recall and precision of SemFrame outputs  . Finally , the multistep process of merging smaller verb groups into verb groups that are intended to correspond to frames sometimes fails to achieve an appropriate degree of correspondence  ( all the verb classes discovered are not distinct )  . 
Lin and Pantel have taken a similar approach , 4 ? naming ? their verb clusters by the first three verbs listed for a cluster  , i . e . , the three most similar verbs . 
In our future work , we will experiment with the more recent release of WordNet  ( 2 . 0) . This version provides derivational morphology links between nouns and verbs  , which will promote far greater precision in the linking of verb senses based on morphology than was possible in our initial implementation  . Another significant addition to WordNet 2 . 0 is the inclusion of category domains , which colocate words pertaining to a subject and perform the same function as LDOCE's subject field codes  . 
Finally , data sparseness issues may be addressed by supplementing the use of the lexical resources used here with access to  , for example , the British National Corpus , with its broad coverage and carefully-checked parse trees  .
