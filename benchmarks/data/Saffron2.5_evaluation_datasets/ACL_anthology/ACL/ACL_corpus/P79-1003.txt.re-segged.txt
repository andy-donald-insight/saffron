This paper describes an approach to conceptual analysis and understanding of natural language in which linguistic knowledge centers on individual words  , and the analysis mechanisms consist of interactions among distributed procedural experts representing that knowledge  . Each word expert models the process of diagnosing the intended usage of a particular word in context  . The WordExpertParser performs conceptual analysis through the Interact lons of tl ~ e individual experts  , which ask questions and exchange information in converging on a single mutually acceptable sentence meaning  . The WordExpert theory is advanced as a better cognitive model of natural language understanding than the traditional rule-based approaches  . The WordExpertParser models parts o~tSe theory  , and the important issues of control and representation that arise in developing such a model \ [ orm the basis of the technical discussion  . An example from the prototype LISP implementation helps explain the theoretical results presented  . 
\[. Introduction
Computational understanding of natural language requires complex Interactions among a variety of distinct yet redundant mechanisms  . The construction of a computer program to perform such a task begins with the development of an organizational framework which Inherently  . incorporates certain assumptions about the nature ot these processes and the environment in which they take place  . Such cognitive premises affect nro ? oundly the scope and substance of computational ~ nalys is for comprehension as found in the program  . 
This paper describes a theory of conceptual parsing which considers knowledge about language to be distributed across a collection of procedural experts centered on individual words  . Natural language parsing with word expert sent ai ls several new hypotheses about the organizat ion and representation of linguistic and pragmatic knowledge for computational language comprenension  . The WordExpertParser \[1\] demonstrates hpw the word expert qTt ~ T~edw ? ~ h certain ocher choice so a seo on previous work  , affect structure and process in a cognitive model of parsing  . 
The WordExpertParser is a cognitive model of conceptual language analysis in which the uni to fltngu ~ stic knowledge is the word and the fqcu~o ~ researchts these tor processes unoerly in R comprehension  . The model is aimed directly at problem ~ of word sense ambiguity and idiomatic expressions  , and in greatly generalizing the notion of wor a sense  , promotes these issues to a central place in the study of language parsing  . Parsing models typically copeuns at is factorily with the wide heterogeneity of usages of particular words  . If a sentence contains a standard form of a word , it can usually be parsed ; if it involves a less prevalent form which has a different part of speech  , perhaps it too can be parsed . Disti . nguishing a men 8 the ~ any senses of a common vero , adjective , or pronoun , tar example , or correctly translating idioms are rarely poss ible  , At the source of this difficulty is the reliance on rule-based formalisms  , whethar syntactic or semantic ( e . g . . cases ) , which attempt to capture ~ helinguistic contributions inherent in constituent chunks or sentences that consist of more than single words  . A crucial assumption underlying work on the Word Expert Parser is that the ~ undamental unit of linguistic Knowledge is the word  . and that understanding its sense or role in a par ticular context is the central parsing process  . In the parser to be described , the word expert constitutes the kernel of li nguistic knowled ~ ndzts representation the e ~ emental data structure  . IE is procedural in nature and executes direct ly as a process  , cooperating with the other experts for a given sentence to arrive at a mutually acceptable sentence meaning  . 
Certaln principles behind the parser d 9 nq t follow directly from the view or worn primacy  , out ~ romother recent theories of parsing . The cognitive processes involved in language comprehension comprise the focus of linguist i c study of the word expert approach  . Pars in8 is viewea as an inferential process where l inguistic knowledge of syntax and semantics and general pragmatic knowledge are applied in a uniform manner during I The research descr ibed in this renor ~  . is funded by the National Aeronautics and Space Admzn~stratton under grant  , numbe , rNSC-7255 . Their support is gratefully acK now leage G  , Interpret at lon . This methodological position closely follows that of Rlosbeck  ( see\[2\] and\[3\] ) and Schank\[4\] . The central concern with word usage and word sense ambiguity follows similar motivatlons of Wllks  \[5\]  . The control structure of the WordExpertParser results from a greqment  . with ~ he hypothesis of . Harcus that parsing can he noneae term znts tt cally and ~ n awaytnDhlcn information  , gained through interpretation is permanent\[6\] . Rieger ~ view of inference as intelligent secect lontmong a number of competing plausible alternatives  7J of course forms the cornerstone of the new theory  . Hi ~ ideas on word sense selection for language analysis  ( \[8\] and\[9 ~ ) and strategy selection for general problem solving \  [10\ ] constitute a consistent cognitive perspective  .

The representation and control issues involved in basing a parser on word experts are discussed below  , following presentation of an example execution of the existing WordExpertParser  .

Some word senses of " heavy "1 . An overweight person is politely called " heavy ":" He has become quite heavy  . " 2 . Emotional music is referred to as " heavy " : " Mahler writes heavy music  . " ~ . An intensity of precipitation is " heavy ": " A heavy snow is expected today  . "
Some word senses of " ice "
I . The solid state of water is called " ice " : " I cemelts at  0Oc   .  " 2 . " Ice " participates In an idiomatic neminal describing a favorite delight : " Home made ice cream is delicious  .  " 3 . " Dry Ice " is the solid state of carbond ioxide : " Dryice will keep that cool  ; 11 day . " ~ . " Ice " or " iced " describes things that have been cooled  ( sometimes with ice ) : " Oneiced teatogoplease .  " 5 . " Ice " also describes things made of ice : " The ices culptures are beautiful ~"  6  , 7 . " Ice hockey " is the name of a popular sport which has a rule penelizln ~ an action cal led " icing ": " Reiced the puck causing a face-off  .  " ~ . The term " icebox " refers to both a box contain ingice used for cooling foods end are frigerator : " This ice box isn't plugged in ~" Flsure  1: Example contextual word usages " . over " , and ~ of orth , from a dis~flle ~ and . or ~ anizin 8 them along with data repositories cal~e ~ wor ~ oIns in a left to right order in ~ he sentence level wo~k~pace  . 
Note that three copies ott T~-3R ~ . . . t ~ or " the " an bc . ~ ocop . ies of each expert for " deep " and " pit " appear in th ~ worK space  . Since each expert executes as a process , each process In et antlatlon in the works pa . .ce must be put in to an executaole s ta te . At this point , the parse is ready to begin . 
The word expert for " the " runs first , and is able to terminate immediately , creating a new concept designator ( called a concept bin and participating in the concept level works p~f ~" ~ i clT-'will eventually hold the data the intellectual phi lo sopher described in the input  . Next the " deep " expert runs , and since " deep " has a number of word senses , 5 is unable to ter Ninate(i . e ~, complete its dlscrimine tlgn task ) .   . Instead , it ~ uspen as its execution , stating the conditions upon winch it should be resumed  . These conditions take the form of associat ive trigger patterns  , and are referred to as disambiguate x pressions Involving gerunds or participles such as " the maneatir ~ tiger "  . A full discussion ot thls will appear in \[12\] . 
4 Al ~ hough I call them " processes " . word experts are actually coroutlnes resembling CONNIVER's generators\[tS\]  , and even more so , the stack groups of the MITL~SP
Machine\[14\].
5 1t should be clear that the notion of " word sense " as used here encompasses what might more tradi tionally be ~ escr  . ibea as " contextua ~ or nusage " , Aspect so ~ a word token's linguistic envlromnent constitute Its broadened " sense "  . 
restart demons . The " deep " expert creates . are start demon cowakel ' Cup when the sense ot the nominal to its right  ( l . e . , " ~ hllosopher ") becomes knoWn . The exper ~ f . or " philosopher now runs , observes the co . ntrol state ot the parser , ant contributes the tact ChatOne new concept refers to a person e  . ngaged in the study of philosophy . 
As this expert terminates , the expert to t " = eep " resumes spontaneously , and , constrained by the fact chat " deep " must describe an entity that can be viewed as a person  , it finally terminates successfully , contributing the fact that the person is in tellectual  . 
The " throw " expert runs next and successfully prunes away several usages of " throw " for contextua  , reasons . A major reason for the semantic richness of verbs such as " throw "  , " cake " , and " Jump " , is that In context , each interacts strongly with a number of succeedin8 pre~ositions and adverbs to form distinct mean in Bs  , The woro expert approach easily handles this grouping together or words to to rn larger word- like entities  . In the particular case of verbs , the expert for a word like . " throw " simply exam . ines . i~ . srSght lexical n . eighbor , an ~ oases its oWn sense alscr tmlnet2on on the co ( Rolnetlonor ~ at it . expects cof ind there , what It actually finds ere , an ~ what this neighbor tells it ( if It So assor at as to ask )  .

' )  . Before any such substantive conceptual activi ty takes place ~ however  ,   . t ~" S " expert ~ unsarm ~ ontri ~ uCesItss tannaro morphological information to throw " s data bin  . This execution of the " s " expert does not , of course , affect " throw"'s suspended status . 
The " the " expert for the second " the " in the sentence runs next  , and as in the previous case , creates a new con . cep ~ b into represent the da . ~a about the nonina ~ and descrlptlo . n , to come . Lne " peecn " expert realizes that It coulo oe either a noun or an adjective  , and thus attempts what ~ calla " pairing " operation with its right neighbor  . It essentially asks the expert for " pit " if the twoot them form a noun-noun pair  . To determine the answer , ooth " pit " and " peach " have access to the entire model of linguistic and pragmatic knowled Be  . Durtn ~ this time . ~ peach " is in as t . a ~ e called " attempting pairing " which Is nlzrerent trom the " suspended " state of the " throw " ex  . ~ . ert . " Pit " answers back that it does pair up with " peach '  ( since " pit " is a ware of its run-time context  ) and enters the " rea . dy " state . " Peach " . nowned : ermines its c . or re~t sense and t ; erm ~ netee : An . d~nc ~ only one mean % ngrul sense ~ or ' plt remains  , the pit expert executes quickly ,   . t . ermlnattng with the contextually a ~ pro~riace " trulCpit " sense  . Asic terminates , the piC . expert closes off the concept b . in In which It part ~ cipaces , spontaneously resumins the " throw " expert . An examination of the nature of fruitpit . a reveals that they are pergect . lysuited to propelling with ones . arm , ar ~ thus , the " th . row " expert terminates success zul ~ y , contributing its wore sense to its event concept bin  . 
.The " lnto ~ expert , runs next , opens a concept b in ~ of t ~ p e ' setting " ) rot the time , location , or situation about to be described , and suspends itself . Onsuspension , " ln to "' s expert posts an associative res tart condition that will e  . nable . its re . sumptlon when a new p~cture concept~s opened to the right  . This initial action CaKesp ~ a cerotmost prepositions  . In certain cases , if the end of a sentence is reached before an appropriate expected concept is opened  , an expert will take alternative action . For example , one of the " in " experts restart trigger patterns consists of control state data of Just this kind--if the end of a sentence is rear  . had . and no . conceptuql object , for the sect . ing creace ooy " In " has oe en round , the " in " expert wxl ~ resume nonetheless , and create a default concept tor perform some kind of intelligent reference aeterminatlon  . 
The sentence " The doctor is In . " illustrates this point .

In our seep ~ c example , " deep " ~ oets expectations on the central table au of global control state Knowledge  , and waits rot " pit " to terminate ? " PIt "' s expert now runs  , and since thls ~ . oI ~ , or printed matter , " pit " maps immediately onto a large hole in the ground  . This in turn , causes both the resumption and termination of the " deep " expert as well as the closure of the concept b into whlch the ~ oelong  . At the closing of the concept b in , the " into expert resumes , marks its concept as a location , and terminates . With all the word experts completed and all concept bins closed  , the expert for " . '" runs and completes the parse . The concept level workspace now contains five concepts : a picture concept designating an intellectual philosopher  , an event concept representing the throwing action  , another picture concept describing a fruitpit which came from a peach  , a setting concept representing a location , and the picture concept which describes precisely the nature of this location  . Work on the mechanism to determine the schematic roles of the concepts has just begun  , and is described brief l ~ later .

3. Structure of the Model
The organization of the parser centers around data repositories on two levels -- the sentence level workspace contains a word bin for each word  ( and sublexical morpheme ) of the input and the concept level workspace contains a concept b in  ( described above ) for each concept referred to in the input sentence  . A third level of processing , the schema level works pae e , while not yet implemented , will contain a schema for each conceptual action of the input sentence  . All actions affecting the contents of these data bins are carried out by the word expert processes  , one of which is associated with each word b in in the workspace  . In addition to this first order information about lexical and conceptual objects  , the parser contains a central table au of control state descriptions available to any expert that can make use of self referential knowledge about its own processing or the states of processing of other model components  . The availability of such control state information improves considerably both the performance and the psychological appeal of the model--each word expert attempting to disambiguate its contextual usage knows precise lyt~e progress of its neighbors and the state of convergence  ( or the lack thereof ) of the entire parsing process . 
Word Experts
The principal knowledge structure of the model is the word sense discrimination expert  . A word expert represents the the linguistic knowledge required to dlsamblguate the meaning of a single word in any context  . 
Although represented cumputations llyas corout lnes  , these experts differ considerably from a d hocLISP programs and have approximately the same ~ elatlon ~ oLISP as an augmented transition network \  [15\] grammar .  ?  2use as rh~graphic represept at lon of an augmented translt lonnetwor ~ aemonstrates the basic control paradigm of the ATN parsing approach  , a graphic representation for word experts exists which embodies its functional framework  . 
Each word expert derives from a branching discrimination structure called a word sense discrimination network or sense net  . A sense necconsists of an ordered se ~ of ?/ ~ tr ~ Ti~g  ( the nodes of the network )  , and for each one , the set of possible answers to that question ( the branches emanating from each node )  . Traversal of a sense network represents the process of converging on a single contextual usage of a word  . The terminal nodes of a sense net represent dis tinct word senses of the word modeled by the network  . A sense net for the word " heavy " appears in part  ( a ) of Figure 2 . Examination of this network reveals that four senses are represented -- the three adjective usages shown in Figure  1 plus the numinal sense of " thug " as In " Joe's heavy told me to be a tit  . "
Expert Representation
The network representation of a word expert leaves out certain computational necessities of actually using it for parsing  . A word expert has two fundamental activities .   ( I ) An expert asks questions about the lexical and conceptual data being a massed by its neighbors  , the control states of various model components , and more general issues requiring common sense or knowledge of the physical world  . (2) In addition , at each node an expert performs actions to affect the lexical and conceptual contents of the workspaces  , the control states of itself , concept bins ,   6An ATN without arbitrarily complex LISP computations on each arc and at each node  , that is . 
7In addition to common sense knowledge of the physical world  , this could include information about the plot , characters , or focus of a children's story , or in a specialized domain such as medical diagnosis\  [17\  ]  , could include highly domain specific knowledge  . 
and the parser as a whole , and the model's expectations . 
The current procedural representation of the word expert for " heavy " appears as part  ( b ) of Figure 2 . 
Each word expert process Includes three components -- a declarative header  , a start node , and a body . The header provides a description of the expert's behavior for purposes of inter-expert constraint for warding  . If sense discrimination by a word expert results in the knowledge that a word to its right  , either not yet executed or suspended , must map to a specific sense or conceptual category  , then it should constrain it to do so , thus helping it avoid unnecessary processing or fallacious reasoning  . Since word experts are represented as processes , constraining an expert consists of altering the pointer to the address at which it expects to continue execution  . Through its descriptive header , an expert conditions this activity and insures that it takes place without disastrous consequences  . 
Each node in the body of the expert has a type deslgnated by a letter following the node name  . either Q(question ) , A ( action ) , S(suspend ) , or T ( terminal ) . By tracing through the question nodes ( treating the others as vacuous except for their gorepointers  )  , a sense network for each word expert process can be derived  . The graphical framework of a word expert ( and thus the questions it asks ) represents its principal linguistic task of word sense disamblguatlon  . Each question node has a type , shown following the Q in the . node--MCt multiple choice ) , C(conditional ) , YN(yes/no / , and PI(posslble/Imposslble ) . In the example expert for " heavy " , node nl represents a conditional query into the state of the entire parsing process  , and n?de n\[2 a multiple choice question involving the conceptual nature of the word to " heavy " s right in the input sentence  . 
b Multiple choice questions typically delve into the aslc relations among  ob3ects annactions zn the world . 
For example , the question asked at node n12 of the " heavy " expert is typical : " Is the object to my right better described as an artistic object a a form of precipitation  , or a physical object ? Action nodes in the " heavy " expert perform such tasks as determining the concept b into which it contributes  , and pqst in 8 expectations for the word to its right . In terms ot its side effects , the " heavy " expert is fairly simple . 
A full account of the word expert representation language will be available next year  \[12\]  . 
Expert Questions
The basic structure of the WordExpertParser depends principally on the role of indiv idual word experts in affect lug  .   ( 1  ) each other : sactions and ~2 ) the neclar at lve result or comput at lonal analysis  . ~x perts affect each other by posting expectations on the central bulletinboard  , constraining each other , changing control states of model components ( most notably themselves )  , and augmenting data . structures in . the work speces .  ?  . They contribute to the conceptua ? ansecnematl c result ot to eparse by contrl buting object names  , descrlptions ~ schemata , ane other useful data to the concept level workspace  . To determine exactly what contributions . to make , i . e . j the accurate ones In the particular run -tlmecontext at handj the experts as ~ quest ions ot various kinds about the processes ot the model and the world at large  . 
Four types of questions may be asked by an exper t  , and whereas some queries can be made in more than one way  , the several question types solicit different kinds of information  . Some questions requlre fairly involved inference to be answered adequately  , and others demand no more than simple register lookup  . This variety corresponds well , in my opinion , with human processing involved in conceptual analysis  . Certain contextual clues to meaning are structural  ; taking advantage of them requires sole l ~ knowledge of the state of the parsing process  ( e . g . , ' building a noun prase ") . Other clues subtly present themselves through more global evidence  , usually having to do with linking together h igh order information about the specific domain at hand  . In story comprehension , this involves the plot , characters , focus of attention , and general social psychology as well as common sense knowledge about the world  . Understanding texts uealing with specialized subject matter requires knowledge about that par ticular subject  , other subjects related to it , and of course , common sense . The questions asked by a word expert in arr iving at the correct contextual interpret at ion of a word probe sources of both kinds of information  , and take different forms .

The Importance of HulClple Choice
Multiple choice questions comprise the centra linferential component of word experts  . They derive from R1eger 's notion that intelligent selection among compet in  8 alternatives by . relative . differencing represents an important aspect oz human proe~em so ~ vlr ~  \[7\]   . The WordExpertParser , unlike certain standardized tests , prohibits multiple choice questions from contaln lnRa " none of the above " choice  .

an implausible proposition or reference lmplauqible objects ? He surely does his best Co make sense ot the sentence  , no master whatie says . Depending on the context , certain intelligent and literate people create metaphorical interpretations for such sentences  . The word expert approach interprets metaphor , idioms and " normal " text wleh the same mechanism  . 
Multiple choice questions make this poss ible hut a newering them may require t remendously complex processing  , A substantial knowledge representation zormal is m based on semantic networks  , such as ~ RI .

Clearly , RAIN can be viewed ass PHYSICAL-OBJECT ; much less so as an ARTISTIC-OBJECT . However , in almost all contexts , RAIN is closest conceptually to PRECIPITATION .

1 2 could either be one that already exists in the workspace or a new one created by the expert at the time of its decision  . After deciding on a concept , the principal role of a ( content ) word expert is to discriminate among the possibly many remaining senses of the word  . Note that a good deal of this disambiguation may take place during the initial phase of concept determination  . After asking enough questions to discover some piece of conceptual data  , this data augments what already exists in the word's concept  5 in , including declarative structures put there both by itself and by the other lexical participants in that concept  . The parse completes when each word expert in the . workspacenasterminated . At this point , the conceptieve z worK space contains a complete conceptual interpretation ot the input text  . 
Conceptual Case Resolution
Adequate conceptual parsing of input text regulres a stage missing from this dlscuss lon and constituting the current phase of research --- the attachment of each picture and setting concept  ( bin ) to the appropriate conceptual case of an event concept  . Such a mechanism can be viewed in an entirely analogous fashion to the mechanisms just described for perform ln  8 local disamblguation of word senses . Rather ~ hanword experts , however , the experts on this level are conceptual in nature  . The concept level thus becomes the main level of activity and a new level  , call it the schema level workspace , turns into the ma~n repository rot inferredIn formation  . When a concept b in has closed , a concept expert is retrieved from a disk file , and initialized . 
If it is an event concept , its function is to fill its conceptual cases with settings and pictures  ; if it is a setting or picture , it must a etermlne its schematic role . 
The activity on this level , therefore , involves higher order processing than sense discrimination  , but occurs in Just about the same way . The ambiguities involved in mapping known concepts into conceptual case schemata appear identical to those having to do with  ma2ping words into concepts . Discovering that the word " pit maps in a cer tain context to the notion of a " fruit pi t " requires the same abilities and knowledge as realizing that " theredhouse " maps in some context to the notion of " a ~ ocation for smoking pot and listening to records  "  . The implementation of the mechanisms to carry out this next level of inferential disambiguation has already begun  . 
It should be quite clear that this schematic level is by no means the end of the line--active expert-base op ~ ot following and general text understanding fltnicely Int ? the word expert framework and constitute its loglca ~ extension  . 
4. Summary and Conclusions
The WordExpertParser is a theory of o rganization and cgntro ~ for a conceptual  , lansuage an @ . ~yzer . Th ~ contro ~ envlrosments cnaracter ~ zeonya co ? ~ ectlonot generator-like coroutines  , called word experts , which cooperatively arrive at a conceptual interpretation of a n ~ n put sentence  . Many torms of linguistic ann non-lln~uist lc knowledge are available to these experts In performing their task  , including control state Knowledge and knowledge of the world  , and by eliminating all but the mpst persis tent forms of ambiguity  , the parser models numan processing . 
This new model of pars in ? claims a number of theoretical advantages :  ( I ) Its representations of linguistic knowledge reflect the enormous redundancy in natural languages -- without this redundancy in the model  , the inter-expert hands haking ( seen in many . .forms in the example parse ) would not be possible . ~ z ) ~ne model suggests some interesting approaches to language acquisition  . Since much of a word expert's knowledge Is encoded in a branching discrimination structure  , , addlng new information about a word involves the additionoz a new branch  . This branch would be placed in the expert at the point where the contextual clues for dlsambiguatlng the new usage differ from those present for a known usage  .   ( 3 ) Idiosyncratic uses of langua8@ are easily encooea , s~nce the wore expert provides a c~esr way to no so  . These uses are indistinguishable from other uses in their encodings in the model  .   ( 4 ) The parser represents a cognltively plausible model orse ~ uent lal coroutine-like processing in human ~ anguage understanding  . The organization of linguistic knowledge around the word  , rather than the rewrite rule , motivates interesting conjectures about the flow of control In a human language understander  .
