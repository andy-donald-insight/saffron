This mssesss that the compe ~ eace theory of TAG's can be profitably projoc~ed to s~na:tur ~ at the morphoiogica Jleve/as weft as the preseat syntacuc level  2  .

To adjoin an auxiliary tree A with reo ? , - ~ tegory X to a in/t/a/(orclenv ~) tree T , we first se/ecz some node of catesory X within T to be the point at which the adjunction is to occur  . Then ( 1 ) the subcree of T dominated by that instance of X ( carlit X ' ) is removed from T , (2) the au . vili ~ ry ~ Aiskn/t into Tat the pos/tioQ where X " had be ret I celted  , and (3) die sublree detainer_ . . 4 by X " iskn/t into A to replace the second cg curencu of the catego ~ X at T's frontier  . The two trees have now been merged by " up/icing " A into T  , disp/acing the subcrea of T at the pmnt of the adjunction to the fromier of A  .

2.1 Keyf , _,_m ~ of the theory of TAG's
A TAG tq xectfi ~ mr faeem ' ucture . There is no notion of derivation from deep structure in the theory of TAG's--the primitive trees are not transformed or otherwise changed once they are introduced into a text  , only combined with other primitive trees . As Kmch and Jmhipo intout , this means that a TAG is incomplete ms an account of the structure of a natural language  , e . g . a TAG grammar wW contain ~ than active and a passive form of the same verbal sut x : a tegurization pattern  , without an theory-mediate description of the very clme relationship between them  . 
To our minds this is by uo means a deficit . The p~c ~ lural machinery that generative grammars have traditionally carried with them to characterize relations like that of active to passive has only gotten in the way of employing tho ~ characterizations in processing models of generation  . This is because a generation model , like any theory of performance , has a proceduralm ' ucture of its own and cannot coexist with an incompatible one  , at least not while still operating efficiently or while retain in  5 a simple mapping from its actual machine to the virtual machine that its authors put forward ms their ao~unt of psycholinguistic data  . 
Our own generator uses surface structurems its only expficifly represented linguistic level  . Thus grammatical formalisms that d well on the rules governing surface form are more useful to us than those that hide those rules in a deep to surface transformational process  . 
A TAGInvolves the manl pulatle a of very mmail demantarym ' uctures  . This is _'~'__~_ use of the stipulation that elementary trees may not include recumve nodes  . It implies that the sentences one ~ in everyday usage  , e . g . 
aew paper texts , are the result of many_o_ , __e~6_'readjunctions . 
This melds nicely with a move that we have made in recent years to view the conceptual representation from which generation proceeds ms consisting of a heap of very small  , redundantly related information units that have been defiberately selected by a text plann in ~ g ~ from the total state of the knowledge base at the time of utterance  ; each such unit will correspond in the finalte ~ to a head lexical item plus selected thematic arguments -- a linguistic entity that is easily projected onto the elementary trees of a 

TAGU~n 7Indudes ~ lyowoperm ~ oa , mqemetlom , and other wim . --~-, u . 4,  .  , ,  . ~ to the elemantary trees that gotnts ? text . This compomwell with the indefibllitympulatiou in our mode/of gene ~ uion  , tince a dected text fragments ~ be ~ di ~ yall ~ byth@gl~mm~r without the need for any later transformation  . The composition options delimited by the constraints on adjunction given with a TAG define a space of alternative text forms which can correspond directly in generation to alternative conceptual relations among information units  , alternatives in rhetorical intent , and alternatives in t , ,~me style . 
3. Adapting TAG's to Generation
The mapping from TAG's as a form aligm for competence theories of language to our formalism for generation is strikingly direct  . As we described in Section 5 their adjunction operation corresponds to our attachment Wcgess  ; their constraints ou adjunction correspond to our attachment points  ; their surface structure trees correspoad to our surface structure trees  , tWe further hypothesize that two quite strong correspondence claims can be made  , though considerably more experimentation and the orizing will have to be done with both formalisms before these claims can be c~n firmed  . 
I . The primitive information units in renlization specifications can be realized exclusivelyms one or another elementary treems def'med by a suitable TAG  , i . e . linguistic criteria can be used inderermmmg the proper modularity of the conceptual structure  .  2 2 . Convex ~ ly , for any textual relationship which our generator would derive by the attachment of multiple information units into a ~ ingle package  , there is a correslxmding rule of adjunct/on . Since weu ~ attachment in the rp , ~li , ~tiou of nominal compounds like " o // tanker ' , this has the force of extending the domain of TAG analyses into morphology  . ( See section 7) . 
4.1 " he Place of Grammar in a Tneory of
Generat/on
To understand why we are looking at TAG's rather than some other form a Ji~n  , one must first understand the role of grammar within our ~ g model  . The foflowing is a brief summary of the model ; a more complete description can be found in McDonald & Pustejovsky \] Our model ot geaeratio e dora coteml : ~ oy the ~ tre ~ ot labe  . t ~ ~ that appear in most t tmm , etical ~ ~ Ourmtrfa ~ strtEtut ~ iaeoqlofat ~ timm ~ umti ~ ottzem  , but it also iacl ,  . , t .

We have always had two complement a ~ goats in our research : on the one hand our generation program huhad to be of practical utility to the I mow edge based expert systems that use it as part of a natural language interface  . 
This means that architecturally our generator has always dmgned to produce text from mecepmal spm : ~ catlons  , " plans " , dev do ~ by another program and come quenfly has had to bemmtive to the limitations and v-ap~g approaches of the present state of the art in concepmal reprewntation  . 
At the same time , we want the architecture of the vimudm~hlne that we abstract out of our program to be effective as a murce of psycholinguis ~ chypothesm about the actual generation p ~ c ~ em that humans use  ; it should , for example , provide the basis for predictive ___~ mts of human speech error behavior and apparent p ~ ann in sl imitatio B  . To achieve this , we have restricted om ~ lves to a highly constrained set of representations and operations  , ? n d have adopced strong and mgge ~ vestipulations on our dmigu such as high locality  , information encaptmlation , online qua ~- realtim or tlo time perform an ~ , and inclelibility . 3 restricts us up to grammm , but disaplines us as theomu . 
We me the pm ce ~ of generation u involving tluen temporally intmmingied activities :  ( 1 ) determin in $ what goats the u ~ ( ~ istOac . hie ~ e ,   ( 2 ) plxnn in S what inform a boll omtent and rhetorical force will best meet those goals given the context  , and ( 3 ) realizing the tpectfied inlormation and rhetorical intent as a grammatical teat  .

As described in \[ McDonald19@t\] , LC is a " ~ on~ed " process : it ~ them - ~ nue of the realization specification it is given  , plus the syntactic surfa~t true ture of the text in progrem  ( which it extends incrementally as the qxa : ? fication is mafized  ) to directly control its sc tions , in t~t , ~ hagthem as though they were sequential computer programs  .

4.1 Unlmmclll ~ Syaemb : Gramman
Of the established linguistic formalims , systemic grammar \ [ Halliday 1976\] has always been the most important to AI researchers on generation  . Two of the mo ~ important generation systems that have been deveJoped  , PROTEUS ~ Davey 1974\] and NIGEL\[Mann & Manhie ~ en 1983\]  , amsystemic grammar , and others , including ourselves , have been mongly influenced by it . 
The reasons for thisent b , ,tlatm are central to the special concerns of generation  . Systemic grammars employ a functional vocabulary : they empha ~/ zethe uses to which language can be put--how languages achieve their speakers " go a Ls -rather than its formal structure  . Since the generation pm cembegins with goals , unlike the comprehension process which begins with structure  , this orientation makes systemic grammars more immediately useful than  , for example , tramffot mation ai gener at b , + grammars or even procedurally oriented AI fogmali-qa~s of language such as ATN's  . 
The generation researcher's primary question is why use one construction rather than another- -active instead of pa~ive  , " the " instead of " a ' . " toe principle device of a systemic grammar , the " choice system " , mppom this question by highlighting how the constructions of the language are gmup ud into met of altemative tChoice systems pro~t dean anchoring point for the rules of a theory of language u ~ t in  , - , , it it natural to associate the vaziotm romantic , disgou ~ , or rhetorical criteria that bearoa the mlection of a given ~ on or feature with the choice system to which the consmmtion belongs  , thus providing the basis of a decision-Wm:edure for rejecting from its Listed atternatives  ; the NIGEL sy~em does ~ y this in its " choose r " p~c ~_ ~ M_ures  . 
In our formalism ~ make tt ~ eo ~ ttu ~ sainti ~ l ' or mat Wn a  . ? asy~emic grammar captures , however we have choosen to bundle it quited if feremly  . The maderlyiogreat ~ for this is that our concern for p~/cholinguistic modeling and efficient procem in ~ takes ~ ce in our design decisions about how the facts of language and language me should be repretented in a generator  . It is thus instructive to look at the different kinds of linguistic information that a network of choice systems carry  . In our system we distribute the ~ , -- to separate computational devimm . 
oDelx ~ cl?ncies amongsmmtutal features : A generator must respect the constraints that dependencies impom and appgecia m  ,  . he impact they have on its reafization options : for example that to memburdinated a-  , ~_ can a namex press ten ~ or modality while main datum are required to  ; or that a j ~ inll ~ Ob ~ Ol ~ fo N pll ~ de ~ ent while a leal calob ~ cts leaves it optiom d  . 
96 o Usage criteria . The deei_'Moapr ~___~_mms associated with each choice system are not a part of theoamms L rpl ~ m  , althOUghthfy~natllg ~ yasaociated with it and organized by it  . Also mosts ~ lra ~\ [ licglr ' amm ~ ll include V ~' ya ~ f ~ tuns ~ te has " gene S : reference " or " completed action '  , which ~ elate the language's surface fennues , and thus are more controllert of why a construct is -_~_ rather than consmJ cuthem set va  . 
o Coordinated mucunal alternative = . Ateutence may be either active or passive , either a question or a statement . By grouping these Mternatives into systems and using the : m systems exclusively when constructing ateat  , one is guaranteed not to ~ bine inconsistent t true tural feat un =  . 
o Efficie at ordering of choice ~ The network that a ~ mects choice systems p ~ ovides a aamral path betweeu decision  , which if followed strictly guarentees that a choice will not be made unlemit is required  , and that it will aot be made before any of the choices that it is it ~ If dependent upon  , insuring that it can be made indelibly . 
o Typology of surface structure . Almost by accident ( since its specification is distributed throughout all of the systems implicidy  )  , the stammer determines the pattern of dominance and cmt stituency relatiom hips of the tat  . While not a principle of the theory , the trees of dauscs , NPs , etc , inty ~ . emi ? grammars tend to be thallow and broad . 
We believe , but have no ? yet established , that equivalence transformations can be defined that would take a systemic grammar as a tpecification to coummct the alternative devices that we use in our generator  ( or augment devices that derive from other murcm , e . g . a TAG ) by 4_-eom_ Ixxing the in/ormation in the sy~emic grammar aloug the lines just U_~___*~_ and redistributing it  .

One of the task domai Mwearec ~, i , ~ . tly developing involves newsl~per reports of current events  .

We have a dolxed this domain because the a e ~ a mporung task  , with its requirement of communicating what is new and tignificant in an event as well as the event it mif  , appears to impome = czptioually rich cooaerain mon the udection of what conceptual informatioo to report and on what syntaeth : omummctiom to u  . ~ in reporting it ( see in Clipplnger & McDmald\[1983 .

Symbols preceded by colons indicate particular featur ~ of the utterance  . The two ex~on t in parenthems r are the content items of the specification and axeresmeted to appear in the utterance in that order  . The first symbol in , . ~eh_expression is a labet indicating the function of that item within the plan  ; embett , bM__ items appearing in angle bracketsere in /ormatiou units from the current-events knowledge base  . 
Obviously this plan must be considerably refined before it could mrve as a proximal to arce for the text  ; that is why we point out that it is a " toplevel " plan  . It is a specification for the general outline of the utterance which muml ~ flC ~ lhedout by rt gugsive planning OU ce its realization has begun and the LC can mpply a linguistic context to further constrain the choices for the units and the rhetorical f cat unm  . 
For present purposes , the key fact to al~reab out this realization specification is how different it is inform from the surface structure  . One cannot produce the-ited text simply by travemng and " reading oat " the dements of the specification as though one were de ~ g production  . S~rear rangements are required , and these must be done under the coutrol of constraints which can only be stated in linguis ~ vocabulary with terms like " subject " or " r ~ i ~in$'  . 
The fire unit in the q x cification , #< sat in . civet . type . .>, is a relation over two other units . It indicates that a commot miity between the two has been noticed and deemed significam in the underlying representation of the event  . 
The premat LC always realize , such relatious by merging the realizations of the two units  . If nothing else occurred , this would give us the tat " Twood tanker , were ~ by mits / ~ r " . 

As it happens , however , a penclmg rhetorical constra/nt from the rcefi~t ion specification  , ~v 8wto-sotm ~ will force the addition of yet another information unit  ,   6 the reporting event by the ~ service that announced the a/edged event  ( e . g . a press relce . ~ from Iraq , Reuters , etc . ) . 
In this case the " content " of the ~ event is the two which have already been p/armed for inclusion in the utterance as past of the " particulars " part of the specification  . L~uslook closely at how that reportiing event unit is folded in to turf a cemmcture  . 
When a mitself the focus of attention , a event is typically realized u " so-and- , m said X ' , that is , the content of the report is more important than the report itsel /  ; whatever sigmficance the report or its source has as new u will be indicated subtlly through which of the alternative realizations below is selected for it  .  7

Our reatization cla . ~ , ~s have their historicor/sire in the choice systems of systemic grammar  , though they are very dLfferent in almost every concrete detail  . The motim portant difference of interest theoretically is that while systemic choice systems select amongs/ogle alternative features  ( e . g . passive , gemn dive ) , realization classes select among entire surface smmture fragments at a tune  ( which might be seen as ~ ed~tious of bundles of features  )  . That is , our approach to genmt ~ on cafls for us to organize our docis/on procedures masto  , elect the values for a number of linguistic feature5 timultaneou My in one choice where a system ~ grnmmar would make the selection incrementally  . 8: gm ' ammm ( a ~ nt propo ~ on verb : ctmk : ~ ( (  ( AGENT-VEFIB s-tJ'~t-PROP a 0 ent verb imp ) cm , m fo cuK s t ~ nt ) emp ~ w ~ se ~0); e . g .

") Jlq gare 3 ~ ~ .   .   . ~shgned m ~ ~_) Returning to our example , we are now faced now with the need to incorporate a unit denoting the report of the Iraqi attacks into the utterance to act as a certification of the #<:~ t ~> events  . This will be done using the reafization class tx ~ eve-veres  ; the cla ~ is applicable to any information un ; t of the form rel~rt(surce , into ) ( and others ) . It determines the reafizat/on of such units both when they appear in is ~ olation and  , as in the present case , when they are to augment an utterance corresponding to one of th ~ z arguments  . 
From this realization class the choicerag ~ VERB- ~ to-Pl ~ OP will be selected s/nce  ( 1 ) the fact that two shipuwere hit is mosts /gnificant  , meaning that the focus will be on the information and not the source  ( n . b .

Formally the muctum is a matree but a unidirectional Ih~ked list whose for madoa rules obey the axioms of a tree  ( e . g . any path " down " through a given node must eventua Uypassback " up " mrough that same node  )  . The path co~of as ~ ream of entiu ~ s representing phrasal nodes  , constituent positions ( indicated by square brack~s )  , in sumces of information units ( in boldface ) , in a anca of words , and activated attachment pomu ( melabeled circle und ~ me ; nedicate ; menext u ; etion ) . The various symbols in the figure ( e . g . mmmce , pred/ram , etc . ) have attached procedures that are activated as the point of speech more aa/ons the path  , a process w ? call q ~ hrammu czure ctecution " .
