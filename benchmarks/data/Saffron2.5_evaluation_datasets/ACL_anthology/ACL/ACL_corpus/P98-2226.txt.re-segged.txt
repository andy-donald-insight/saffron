Abstract
This paper discusses the treatment of fixed word expressions developed for our  ITS-2 French-English translation system . This treatment makes a clear distinction between compounds - i  . e . multiword expressions of X?-level in which the chunks are adjacent-and idiomatic phrases - i  . e . multiword expressions of phrasal categories , where the chunks are not necessarily adjacent . In our system , compounds are handled during the lexical analysis  , while idioms are treated in the syntax , where they are treated as " specialized lexemes " . Once recognized , an idiom can be transfered according to the specifications of the bilingual dictionary  . We will show several cases of transfer to corresponding idioms in the target language  , or to simple lexemes . The complete system , including several hundreds of compounds and idioms can be consulted on the Internet  ( http://latl . unige . ch/itsweb . html) . 
1 Introduction
Multiword expressions ( henceforth MWE ) , are known to constitute a serious problem for natural language processing  ( NLP )  1 . In the case of translation , a proper treatment of MWE is a fundamental requirement  , as few customers would tolerate a literal translation of such common expressions as entrer envigueur ' to come into effect '  , mettreeno euvre ' to implement ' , faire preuve ' to show ' or faire connaissance ' to meet '  .

However , a simple glance at some of the current commercial translation system shows that none of them can be said to handle MWEs in an appropriate fashion  . As a matter of fact , some of them explicitely warn their users not to use multiword expressions  . 
In this paper , we will first stress some fundamental properties of two classes of MWEs  , compounds and idioms , and then present he treatment of idioms developed for our French-English  ITS-2 translation system ( cf . Ram-luckun & Wehrli , 1993) . 
2 Compounds and idioms
A two-way partition of MWEs in ( i ) compounds and ( ii ) idioms is both convenient and theoretically well -motivated  2  . Compounds are defined as MWEs of X?-level ( ie . word level ) , in which the chunks are adjacent , as exemplified in (1) , while " idiomatic expressions " correspond to MWEs of phrasa level  , where chunks may not be adjacent , and may undergo various syntactic operations , as exemplified in (23) . 
(1) a . pomme deterre'potato'b . ~cause de ' because of ' c . d~slorsque ' as soon as ' The compounds given in  ( 1 ) function , respectively , as noun , preposition and conjunction . 
They correspond to a single unit , both syntactically and semantically . In contrast , idiomatic expressions do not generally constitute fixed  , closed syntactic units . They do , however , behave as semantic units . For instance the complex syntactic expression casser du sucresurle do sdequel qu ' un  , literally break some sugar on ~ This distinction between compounds and idioms is also discussed in Wehrli  ( 1997 ) criticize . 
(2) a . Jeana for c~lama in ~ Luc.
Jean has forced the hand to Luc'Jeant wisted Luc ' sh and ' b  . C'est ~ Lucque Jeana for c ~ lama in . 
It is to Lucth at Jean has forced the hand'It is Luc's hand that Jean has twisted'c  . C'est & Lucque Paul pretend que Jean avoulu forcer lama in  . 
It is to Lucthat Paul claims that Jean has wanted to force the hand'It is Luc's hand that Paul claims that 
Jean has wanted to force'd . La mainsemb lelui avoir ~ t ~ unpeufor c ~ e . 
The hand h and seems to him to have been a little forced ' Hish and seems to have been somewhat twisted ' The idiom illustrated in  ( 2 ) is typical of a very large class of idioms based on a verbal head  . Syntactically , such idioms correspond to verb phrases , with a fixed direct object argument ( lama in , in our example ) and an open indirect object argument . Notice that this verb phrase is completely regular in its syntactic behaviour  . In particular , it can can undergo syntactic operation such as adverbial modification  , raising , passive , dislocation , etc . , as examplified in (2b-d ) . 
With example (3) , we have a much less common pattern , since the subject argument of the verb constitutes a chunk of the expression  . 
Here , again , various operations are possible , including passive and raising ~(3) a . Quelle moucheapiqu ~ Paul ? ' What has gotten to Paul ?' b  . Quelle mouchesemblel ' avoir pique ? ' What seems to have got ten to him ' c  . Jeme deman deparquelle mouche Paula ~ t ~ pique  . 
' I wonder what's gotten to him ' 3Another interesting example of idiom with fixed subject islamoutar demonteaunez de NP  ( " NP looses histemper " )  , discussed in Abeille and Schabes (1989) . 
The extent to which expressions can undergo modifications and other syntactic operations can vary tremendously from one expression to the next  , and in the absence of a general explanation for this fact  , each expression must be recorded with the llst of its particular properties and constraints  4  . 
Given the categorial distinction ( X ? vs . XP ) and other fundamental differences sketched above , compounds and idioms are treated very differently in our system  . Compounds are simply listed in the lexicon as complex lexical units  . 
As such , their identification belongs to the lexical analysis component  . Once a compound has been recognized , its treatment in the ITS-2 system does not differ in any interesting way from the treatment of simple words  . 
While idiomatic expressions must also be listed in the lexicon  , their entries are far more complex than the ones of simple or compound words  ( cf . section 3 . 2) . As for their identification , it turns out to be a rather complex operation , which cannot be reliably carried out at a superficial level of representation  . As we saw in the above examples , idiom chunks can be found far away from the ( verbal ) head with which they constitute an expression ; they can also be modified in various ways , and so on . Preprocessing idioms , for instance during the lexical analysis , might therefore lead to lengthy , inefficient or unreliable treatments . We will argue that in order to drastically simplify the task of identifying idioms  , it is necessary to undo whatever syntactic operations they might have undergone  . To put it differently , idioms can best be recognized on the basis of a normalized structure  , a structure in which constituents occur in their canonical position  . In a generative grammar framework , normalized structures correspond to D-structure representations  . At that level , for instance , the four sentences in (2) , share the common structure in (4) .

3 A sketch o f the t rans la t ion process In this section  , we will show how idioms are handled in the French -to-English  ITS-2 translation system , a transfer-based translation system which uses GB -style D-structure representations as interface structures  . The general architecture of the system is given in figure  1 below .

Figure 1. Architecture of ITS-2
For concreteness , we shall first focus on the epinonymous idiom given in  ( 5 ) :  ( 5 ) a . Paula cass~sapipe . 
lit . ' Paul has broken his pipe ' b . Paulkicked the bucket . 
Translation of ( 5a ) is a three-step rocess : ? Identification of source idiom ? Transfer of idiom ? Generation of target idiom  3  . 1 Id iom identi f icat ion As we argued in the previou section  , the task of identifying an idiom is best accomplished at the abstract level of representation  ( D-structure )  . 
ITS-2 uses the IPS parser ( cf . Wehrli ,  1992 ,  1997) , which produces the structure ( 6 ) for the input ( 5a ) 5: ~ In example 6 , we use the following syntactic labels : TP ( Tense Phrase ) for sentences , VP for verb phrases , DP for Determiner Phrases , NP for Noun Phrases , and
PP for Prepositional Phrases.
(6 ) \[ Tt'\[DPPaul\]\[ya\[vp cass ~\[ DP sa\[NPpipe\[ppeli\]I \]\] At this point  , the structure is completely general , and does not contain any specification of idioms . The idiom recognition procedure is triggered by the " head of idiom " lexical feature associated with the head casser  . This feature is associated with all lexical items which are heads of idioms in the lexical database  . 
The task of the recognition procedure is ( i ) to retrieve the proper idiom , if any ( casser might be the head of several idioms )  , and ( ii ) to verify that all the constraints associated with that idiom are satisfied  . Idioms are listed in the lexical database as roughly illustrated in  ( 6 ) 6:  ( 7 ) a . cassers a pipe ' to kick the bucket ' b . 1:\[\]2:\[casser\]3:\[DPVpipe\]c .  1 . \[+ human \] 2 . \[-passive\]3 . \[+ literal ,- extraposition \]
POSSDP
Idiom entries specify ( a ) the canonical form of the idiom ( mostly for reference purposes )  ,   ( b ) the syntactic frame with an ordered list of constituents  , and ( c ) the list of constraints associated with each of the constituents  . 
In our ( rather simple ) example , the lexical constraints associated with the idiom  ( 7 ) state that the head is a transitive lexeme whose direct object has the fixed form " POSSpipe "  , where POSS stands for a possessive determiner coreferential with the external argument of the head  ( i . e . the subject ) . Furthermore , the subject constituant bears the feature \[+ human \]  , the head is marked as \[- passive \] , meaning that this particular idiom cannot be passivized  . Finally , the object is also marked\[?literal , -extraposition \] , which means that the direct object constituent cannot be modified in any way  ( not even pluralized )  , and cannot be extraposed . 
The structure in ( 7 ) satisfies all those constraints , provided that the possessives a refers 6See Walther & Wehrll ( 1996 ) for a discussion of the structure of the lexical database underlying the  ITS-2 project even though an idiom has been recognized in sentence  ( 6 )  , it also has a semantically wellformed literal meaning  . Running ITS-2 in interactive mode , the user would be asked whether the sentence should be taken literaly or as an expression  . In automatic mode , the idiom reading takes precedence over the literal interpretations  . 
3 . 2 Transfer and generat ion of id ioms Once properly identified  , an idiom will be transfered as any other abstract lexical unit  . In other words , an entry in our bilingual exicon has exactly the same form no matter whether the correspondance oncer n simple lexemes or idioms  . The corresponding target language lexeme might be a simple or a complex abstract lexical unit  . For instance , our bilingua lexical database contains , among many others , the following correspondances :
French English avoir be so in de X need X casser sapipe kick the bucket fairela connaissance de Xmeet X avoiren viefe el like quelle mouchea piqu ~ what has gotten The generation of target language idioms follows essentially the same pattern as the generation of simple lexemes  . The general pattern of generation i ITS-2 is the following : first , a maximal projection structure ( XP ) is projected on the basis of a lexical head and of the lexical specification associated with it  . Second , syntactic operations apply on the resulting structure  ( extraposition , passive , etc . ) triggered either by lexical properties or general features transfered from the source sentence  . For instance , the lexical feature \[+ raising \] associated with a predicate would trigger araising transformation  ( NP movement from the embedded subject position to the relevant subject position  )  . Subject-Auxiliary inversion , topicalization , auxiliary verb insertion are all examples of syntactic transformations triggered by general features  , derived from the source sentence . 
7 Given a proper context , the sentence could be construed with s a referring to some other person  , say Bill . 
8Such a heuristic seems to correspond to normal usage  , which would avoid formulation ( Sa ) to state that ' Paul has broken someone ' spipe ' . 
The first step of the generation process produces a target language D-structure  , while the second step derives S-structure representations  . 
Finally , a morphological component will determine the precise orthographical/phonological form of each lexical head  . 
In the case of target language idioms , the general pattern applies with few modifications  . 
Step 1 ( projection of D-structure ) is based on the lexical representation f the idiom  ( which specifies the complete syntactic pattern of the idiom  , as we have pointed out earlier ) , and produces structure (8a ) . Step 2 , which only concerns the insertion of perfective auxiliary in position T ?  , derives the S-structure (8b ) . Finally , the morphological component derives sentence ( Sc )  . 
(8) a . \[ Tp\[DPPaul\]\[vpkick\[vl~the\[bucket \]\]\]\] b  . \[ Tp\[DPPaul\]\[Thave\[vpkick\[the\[ bucket\]]\]\]\] 
NPc . Paul has kicked the bucket.

DP4 Conclusion
In this paper , we have argued for a distinct treatment of compounds  , viewed as complex lexical units of X?-level category  , and of idioms , which are phrasal constructs . While compounds can be easily processe during the lexical analysis  , idiomatic expressions are best handle data more abstract level of representation  , iour case , the D-structure level produced by the parser . The task of recognition must be based on a detailed formal description of each idiom  , alengthy , sometimes tedious but unavoidable task . We have then shown that , once properly identified , idioms can be transfered like any other abstract lexical unit  . Finally , given the fully-specified lexical description of idioms  , generation of idiomatic expressions can be achieved without adhoc machinery  .
