Abstract
A twotier model for the description of morphological  , syntactic and semantic variations of multiword terms is presented  . It is applied to term normalization of French and English corpora in the medical and agricultural domains  . Five different sources of morphological nd semantic knowledge are exploited  ( MULTEXT , CELEX , AGROVOC , Word-Net l . 6, and Microsoft Word 97 thesaurus) . 
1 Introduction
In the classical approach to text retrieval , terms are assigned to queries and documents . The terms are generated by a process called automatic indexing  . Then , given a query , the similarity between the query and the documents i computed and a ranked list of documents is produced as output of the system for information access  ( Salton and McGill ,  1983) . 
The similarity between queries and documents depends on the terms they have in common  . The same concept can be formulated in many different ways  , known as variants , which should be conflated in order to avoid missing relevant documents  . For this purpose , this paper proposes a novel model of term variation that integrates linguistic knowledge and performs accurate term normalization  . It relies on previous or ongoing linguistic studies on this topic  ( SparckJones and Tait , 1984; Jacquemin et al . , 1997; Hamon et al , 1998) . Terms are described in a twotier framework composed of a paradigmatic level and a syntagmatic level that account for the three linguistic dimensions of term variability  ( morphology , syntax , and semantics ) . Term variants are extracted from tagged corpora through FASTR  1  , a unification-based transformational parser described in  ( Jacquemin et al ,  1997) . 
Four experiments are performed on the French and the English languages and a measure of precision is provided for each of them  . Two experiments are made on a French corpus \ [ AGRIC\]composed of  1  . 2 x 106 words of scientific abstracts in
IFASTR can be downloaded www . limsi , fr/Individu/jacquemi/FASTR . 
from the agricultural domain and two on an English corpus\[MEDIC\]composed of  1  . 3x 106 words of scientific abstracts in the medical domain  . The two experiments in the French language are\[ AGRIC\]+  Word97 and\[AGRIC\]+AGROVOC . In the former , synonymy links are extracted from the Microsoft Word97 thesaurus ; in the latter , semantic classes are extracted from the AGROVOC thesaurus  , a thesauru specialized in the agricultural domain  ( AGROVOC ,  1995) . In both experiments , morphological data are produced by a stemming algorithm applied to the MULTEXT lexical database  ( MULTEXT ,  1998) . The two experiments on the English language are \ [ MEDIC\]+WordNet  1  . 6 or\[MEDIC\]+Word 97 ; they correspond to two different sources of semantic knowledge  . In both cases , the morphological data are extracted from CELEX ( CELEX ,  1998) . 
2 Term Var ia t ion : Representat ion and Exp lo i tation Terms and variations are represented into two parallel frameworks illustrated by Figure  1  . While terms are described by a unique pair composed of a structure -- at the syntagmatic level -- and a set of lexical items -- a the paradigmatic level --  , a variation is represented by a pair of such pairs : one of them is the source term  ( or normalized term ) and the other one is the targeter m ( or variant )  . 
The syntagmatic description of a term is a context free rule  ; it is complemented with lexical information embedded in a feature structure denoted by constraints between paths and values  . For instance , the term speed measurement is represented by: Syntagm:i?-+N2N1    ( N1 lemma ) = measurement
Paradigm : N2 lemma >= speed(1)
This term is a noun phrase composed of a head noun  N1 and a modifier N2  ; the lemmas are given by the constraints at the paradigmatic level  . This framework is similar to the unification -based representation of contextfree grammars of  ( Shieber ,  1992) .

Figure 1: Two level description of terms and variations At the syntagmatic level  , variations are represented by a source and a target structure  . At the paradigmatic level , the lexical elements of variations are not instantiated in order to ensure higher generality  . Instead , links between lexical elements are provided . They denote morphological nd/or semantic relations between lexical items in the source and target structures of the variation  . For example , the variation that associates a Noun-Nounterm such as the preceding term speed N =  measurementN1 with a verbal form of the head word and a synonym of the argument such as measuring v l maxima I h shorten-ing Nvelocity N  , = is given by:
Syntagm : ( N ? -+ N2N 1 )  =0"   ( V0--~V1 ( Prep ? Det ? ( AINIPart ) * ) N  ~ )   ( 2 ) root ) = ( Vlroot )  
Paradigm:N12 sem ) = ( Ni2sem)
If this variation is instantiated with the term given in  ( 1 )  , it recognizes the lexicosyntactic structure
Vl ( Prep ? Det ? ( AINIPart ) * ) N  ~ ( 3 ) in which V1 and measurement are morphologically related , and N ~ and speed are semantically related . 
The target structure is underspecified in order to describe several possible instantiations with a single expression and is therefore called a candidate variation  . In this example , a regular expression is used to underspecify the structure2  ; another solution would be to use quasi-trees with extende dependencies  ( Vijay-Shanker ,  1992) . 
3 Paradigmatic relations
As illustrated by Figure 2 and Formula (2) , there are two types of paradigmatic relations between lemmas  2A stands for adjective , N for noun , Prep for preposition , V for verb , Det for determiner , Part for participle , and Adv for adverb . 
involved in the definition of term variations : morphological and semantic relations  . The morphological family of a lemmal is denoted by the set FM  ( l ) and its semantic family by the set FSL ( l ) or F sc ( l )  . 
Semantic family/~-~velocity
Morphological family Semantic family
Figure 2: Paradigmatic links between lemmas Roughly speaking  , two words are morphologi-cally related if and only if they share the same root  . 
In the preceding example , to measure and measurement are in the same morphological family because their common root is to measure  . Let /: be the set of lemmas , morphological roots define a binary relation M from ? to /: that associates each lemma with its root  ( s ) : ME ?~? . M is not a function because compound lemmas have more than one root  . 
The morphological family FM ( l ) of a lemma 1 is the set of lemmas ( including l ) which share a common root with l : Vlef ~ , FM(l ) = l'E/Z*3 rE/: ,  (/ , r ) EM
A(/', r)EM = M-I(M(I )) (4)
There are principally two types of semantic relations : direct links through a binary relation SLE  /2 ~?: or classes CE  ~ ( l ? ( /: ) ) . 
In the case of semantic links , the semantic family Fs ~ ( l ) of a lemma 1 is the set of lemmas ( including l ) which are linked to l:
FSL?IP ( E )
V lE ~ , FSL(l ) = l'?f ~*( l , Y ) ? SLtJl ( 5 ) = ul In the case of semantic lasses , the semantic family F sc ( l ) of a lemmal is the union of all the classes to which it belongs :  ( 6 ) Vle L , Fsc ( l ) = UcU ( l ( c ~ c ) ^ ( tec ) Links and classes are equivalent , the choice of either model depends on the type of available semantic data  . In the experiments reported here , direct links are used to represent data extracted from the word processor Microsoft  Word97 because they are provided as lists of synonyms associated with each lemma  . Conversely , the synsets extracted from WordNet 1 . 6 ( Fellbaum , 1998) are classes of disambiguated lemmas and , therefore , correspond to the second technique . 
With respect to the definitions of semantic and morphological families given in this section  , the candidate variant ( 3 ) is such that V1?FM ( measurement ) and N~?FSL ( speed ) or N~?
Fsc(speed).
4 Morphological and Semantic
Families
In the experiments on the English corpora , the CELEX database is used to calculate morphological families  . As for semantic families , either WordNet 1 . 6 or the thesaurus of Microsoft Word 97 are used . 
Morphological Links from CELEX
In the CELEX morphological database ( CELEX ,  1998) , each lemma is associated with a morphological structure that contains one or more root lemmas  . These roots are used to calculate morphological families according to Formula  ( 4 )  . For example , the morphological family FM ( measurement N ) of the lemmas with measure v as root word is commensurable A  , commensurably Adv , countermea-sure N , immeasurable A , immeasurably Adv , incom-mensurable A , measurable A , measurably Adv , mea-sure N , measure less A , measurement N , mensurable A , tape-measure N , yard-measure N , measure v . 
Semantic Classes from WordNet
Two sources of semantic knowledge are used for the English language : the WordNet  1  . 6 thesaurus and the thesaurus of the word processor Microsoft  Word97  . In the WordNet thesaurus , disambiguated words are grouped into sets of synonyms -- called synsets -- that can be used for a classbased approach to semantic relations  . For example , each of the five disambiguated meanings of the polysemous noun speed belongs to a different synset  . In our approach , words are not disambiguated and , therefore , the semantic family of speed is calculated as the union of the synsets in which one of its senses is included  . Through Formula (6) , the semantic family of speed based on WordNet is : Fsc  ( speed N ) = speed N , speeding N , hurrying N , hastening N , swift-ness N , fastness N , velocity N , amphetamine N . 
Semantic Links from Microsoft Word 97
For assisting document edition , the word processor Microsoft Word97 has a command that returns the synonyms of a selected word  . We have used this facility to build lists of synonyms  . For example , FS n(speed N ) = speed N , swi\]tnesss , velocity N , quickness N , rapidity N , acceleration N , alacrity N , celerity N(Formula (5)) . Eight other synonyms of the word speed are provided by  Word97  , but they are not included in this semantic family because they are not categorized as nouns in CELEX  . 
5 Variations
The linguistic transformations for the English language presented in this section are somehow simplified for the sake of conciseness  . First , we focus on binary terms that represent 91 . 3% of the occurrences of multiword terms in the English corpus \[ MEDIC\]  . 
Then , simplifications in the combinations of types of variations are motivated by corpus explorations in order to focus on the most productive families of variations  . 
The 3 Dimensions of Linguistic Variations There areas many types of morphological relations as pairs of syntactic categories of content words  . Since the syntactic categories of content words are noun  ( N )  , verb ( V ) , adjective ( A ) , and adverb ( Adv ) , there are potentially sixteen different pairs of morphological links  .   ( Associations of identical categories must be taken into consideration  . 
For example , Noun-Noun associations correspond to morphological links between substantive nouns such as agent/process : promoter ~ promotion  . ) Morphological relations are further divided into simple relations if they associate two words in the same position and crossed relations if they associate a head word and an argument  . Combining categories and positions , there are , in all , 64 differentypes of morphological relations . 

In ( Hamon et al ,  1998) , three types of semantic relations are studied : a link between the two head words  , a link between the two arguments , or two paralle links between heads and arguments . These authors report that double links are rare and that their quality is low  . They only represent 5% of the semantic variations on a French corpus and they are extracted with a precision of  9% only . We will therefore focus on single semantic links . Since we are only concerned with synonyms , only two types of semantic links are studied : synonymous heads or synonymous arguments  . 
The last dimension of term variability is the structural transformation at the syntagmatic level  . The source structure of the variation must match a term structure  . There are basically two structures of binary terms :  X1   N2 compounds in which X1 is a noun , an adjective or a participle , and N1 Prep N ~ terms . According to ( Jacquemin et al ,  1997) , there are three types of syntactic variations in French : coordinations  ( Coot )  , insertions of modifiers ( Modif ) , and compounding/decompounding ( Comp ) . Each of these syntactic variations is further subdivided into finer categories  . 
Multidimensional Linguistic Variations
The overall picture of term variations is obtained by combining the  64 types of morphological relations , the two types of semantic relations and the three types of syntactic variations  ( and their subtypes )  . 
There are different constraints on these combinations that limit the number of possible variations :  1  . Morphological and semantic links must operate on different words  . For example , if the head word is transformed by a morphological link  , the only word available for a semantic link is the argument word  . 
2 . The target syntactic structure must be compatible with the morphological transformations  . 
For example , if a noun is transformed into a verb , the target structure must be a verb phrase . 
These two constraints influence the way in which a variation can be defined by combining different types of elementary modifications  . Firstly , lexical relations are defined at the paradigmatic level : morphological in ks  , semantic links or identical words . 
Then a syntactic structure that is compatible with the categories of the target words is chosen  . 
The list of variations used for binary compound terms in English is given in Table  1  .   3 It has been experimentally refined through a progressive corpus-based tuning  . The Synt column gives the target syntactic structure  . The Morph column describes 3punctuations are noted Pu and coordinating conjunction

the morphological link : a source and a target syntactic category and the syntactic positions of the source and target lemmas  . The Sere column indicates whether the variation involves a semantic link and the position of the lemmas concerned by the link  ( both lemmas must have an identical position )  . The Pattern column gives the target syntactic structure as a function of the source structure which is either 
X1N2, A1N2, or N1N2.
For example , Variation #42 transforms an
Adjective-Noun term A1 N2 into
N 1 ( ( CC Det ? ) ? PrepDet ? ( AIN\[Part ) ?- a ) N  ~ N1 is a noun in the morphological family of A1   ( noted FM ( A1 ) N ) and N ~ is semantically related with N2 ( noted Fs ( N2 ) ) . This variation recognizes malignancy in orbital turn outs as a variant of malig-nant tumor because malignancy and malignant are morphologically related  , turn out and tumor are semantically related , and malignancy N in preporbita I Atumours N matches the target pattern  . Variation #56 is a more elaborated version of variation ( 2 ) given in Section 2 . 
Sample Syntactico-semantic Variants from \[ MEDIC \] The first  36 variations in Table 1 do not contain any morphological link . They are built as follows . 
Firstly , the different structures of noun phrases are used as target structures  . Twelve structures are proposed : head coordination  ( #1 )  , argument coordination (#4) , enumeration with conjunction (#7) , enumeration without conjunction (#10) , etc . 
Then each transformation is enriched with additional semantic links between the head words or between the argument words  . Semantic links between argument words are found invariations #  ( 3 n+2 ) o < n < ll and between head words invariations # ( 3n ) l<n<12 . ( Due to the lack of space , only variations #2 and #3 constructed on top of variation #1 are shown in Table 1  . ) Sample variants from \[ MEDIC \] for the first 36 variations are given in Table 2  . Some variations have not matched any variant in the whole corpus  . 
Sample Morpho-syntactico-semantic

Morpho-syntactico-semantic variations are numbered  #37 to #62 in Table 1  . Only 10 of the 64 possible morphologicals sociations are found in the list of morphological links : Noun to Adjective on arguments  ( #37 )  , Adjective to Noun on arguments (#39) , etc . Each of these variations is doubled by adding a semantic link between the words that are not morphologically related  . For example , variation ( #40 ) is deduced from variation ( #39 ) by adding a semantic link between the head words . Sample variants are given in Table 3 .

Precision
Because of the large volumes of data , only experiments on the French corpus are evaluated  . \[AGRIC\]+AGROVOC produces2 , 739 variations and 2 , 485 of them are selected as correct . Since the number of synonym links proposed by Word97 is higher , the number of variants produced by \[ AGRIC\]+ Word97 is higher : 3  , 860 . 3,110 of them are accepted after human inspection . 
The two experiments produce the same set of non -semantic variants  ( syntactic and morphosyntactic variants )  . Associated values of precision are reported in Tables  4 and 5  . The semantic variations are divided into two subsets : " pure " semantic variations and semantic variations involving a syntactic transformation and/or a morphological link  . Their precisions are given in Tables 6 and 7 . 
As far as precision is concerned , these tables show that variations are divided into two levels of quality  . On the one hand , syntactic , morphosyntactic and pure semantic variations are extracted with a high level of precision  ( above 78% , see the " Total " values in Tables 4 to 6) . On the other hand , the variations from Table 1 (#1 to #36) .

The lower precision of hybrid variations is due to a cumulativ effect of semantic shift through combined variations  . For instance , former unrdseaucont in u ( build a continuous network ) is incorrectly extracted as a variant of formation permanente  ( continuing education ) through a Noun-to-Verb variation with a semantic link between argument words  . 
The verb former and the associate deverbal noun formation are two polysemous words  . Information permanente , the meaning is related to a human activity ( to train ) while , in former unrdseaucont in u , the meaning is related to a physical construction  ( to build )  . 
Despite the relatively poor precision of hybrid variations  , the average precision of term conflation is high because hybrid variations only represent a small fraction of term variations  ( 5 . 4% and 0 . 9%, seelines'%sem " in Table 8 below) . The average precision on \[ AGRIC\]+ Word97 is 79  . 8% and the average precision on \[ AGRIC \] + AGROVOC is  91  . 1% . 
The exploitation of semantic links extracted from WordNet in term variant extraction does not suffer from the problem of ambiguity pointed out for query expansion in  ( Voorhees ,  1998) . The robustness to polysemy is due to the fact that we are dealing with multiword terms that build restricted linguistic con-The last line of Table  8 shows that variants represent a significant proportion of term occurrences  ( from 27 . 3% to 37 . 3%) . The distribution of the different types of variants depends the semantic database and on the language under study  . WordNet 1 . 6 is a productive source of knowledge for the extraction of semantic variants : In the experiment\[MEDIC\]+WordNet  , semantic variants represent 58 . 6% of the variants , while they only represent 4 . 9% of the variants in the \[ AGRIC \] + AGROVOC experiment  . These values are reported in the line " Tot . 
Sem " of Table 8 . Such results confirm the relevance of non -specialized semantic links in the extraction of specialized semantic variants  ( Hamon et al ,  1998) . 
7 Conclusion
The model proposed in this study offers a simple and generic framework for the expression of complex term variations  . The evaluation proposed at the end of this paper shows that term variations are extracted with an excellent precision for the three types of elementary variations : syntactic  , morphosyntactic and semantic variations . The best performance is obtained with WordNet as source of semantic knowledge  . Ongoing work on German , Japanese and Spanish shows that such a transformational and paradigmatic description of term variability applies to other languages than French and English reported in this study  . 

We would like to thank Jean Royaut @ and Xavier Polanco  ( INIST-CNRS ) for their helpful collaboration . We are also grateful to B6 atrice Daille ( IRIN ) for running her termer ACABIT on the data and to Olivier Ferret  ( LIMSI ) for the Word97 macro-function used to extract he thesaurus .
