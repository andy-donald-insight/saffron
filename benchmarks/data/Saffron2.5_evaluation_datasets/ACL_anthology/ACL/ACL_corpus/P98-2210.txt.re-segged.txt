1 Introduction
Every language contains complex expressions that are language-specific  . The general problem when trying to build automated translation systems or human-readable dictionaries i to detect expressions that can be used idiomatically and then whether the expressions can be used idiomatically in a particular text  , or whether a literal translation would be preferred  . It follows from the definition of idiomatic expression that when a complex expression is used idiomatically  , it contains at least one element which is semantically " out of context "  . In this paper , we discuss a method that finds idiomatic collocations in a text corpus  . The methodetects semantic asymmetry by taking advantage of dif-ferences in syntactic distributions  . 
We demonstrate the method using a specific linguistic phenomenon  , verb-object collocations . The asymmetry between a verb and its object is the focus in our work  , and it makes the approach different from the methods that use e  . g . mutual information , which is a symmetric measure . 
Our novel approach differs from mutual information and the socalled t-value measures that have been widely used for similar tasks  , e . g . , Church et al ( 1994 ) and Breidt ( 1993 ) for German . The tasks where mutual information can be applied are very different in nature as we see in the short comparison at the end of this paper  . The work reported in Grefenstette and Teufel ( 1995 ) for finding empty support verbs used in nominallsations is also related to the present work  .

Mc-Glashan (1993, p .  213 ) discusses Keenan's principles concerning directionality of agreement relations and concludes that semantic interpretation of functor categories varies with argument categories  , but not vice versa . He cites Keenan who argues that the meaning of a transitive verb depends on the object  , for example the meaning of the verb cut seems to vary with the direct object : ? in cut finger " to make an incision on the surface of "  , ? incut cake " to divide into portions " , ? in cutlawn " to trim " and ? in cuthero in " diminish the potency "  . 
This phenomenon is also called semantic tailoring ( Allerton ,  1982 , p .  27) . 
There are two differentypes of asymmetric expressions even if they probably form a continuum : those in which the sense of the functor is modified or selected by a dependent element and those in which the functor is semantically empty  . The former type is represented by the verb cut above : a distinct sense is selected according to the  ( type of ) object . The latter type contains an object hat forms a fixed collocation with a semantically empty verb  . These pairings are usually language-specific and semantically unpredictable  . 
Obviously , the amount of tailoring varies considerably . A tone end of the continuum is idiomatic usage . It is conceivable that even a highly idiomatic expression like taking toll can where the word toll is used non-idiomatically  , as it also may occur from time to time in any text as  , for instance , in The Times corpus : The IRA could be profiting by charging a toll for cross-borders muggling  . But when it appears in a sentence like Barcelona 's fierce summer is taking its toll  , it is clearly a part of an idiomatic expression . 
3 D is t r ibuted f requency o f an ob jec t As the discussion in the preceding chapter shows  , we assume that when there is a verb-object collocation that can be used idiomatically  , it is the object that is the more interesting element  . The objects in idiomatic usages tend to have a distinctive distribution  . If an object appears only with one verb ( or few verbs ) in a large corpus we expect that it has an idiomatic nature  . The previous example of take tollis illustrative : if the word toll appears only with the verb take but nothing else is done with tolls  , we may then assume that it is not the toll in the literary sense that the text is about  . 
The task is thus to collect verb-object collocations where the object appears in a corpus with few verbs  ; then study the collocations that are topmost in the decreasing order of frequency  . 
The restriction that the object is always attached to the same verb is too strict  . When we applied it to ten million words of newspaper text  , we found out that even the most frequent of such expressions  , make amends and take precedence , appeared less than twenty times , and the expressions have temerity , goberserk and goex-divid end were even less frequent  . It was hard to obtain more collocations because their frequency went very low  . Then expressions like have appendix were equivalently exposed with expressions like run err and  . 
Therefore , instead of taking the objects that occur with only one verb  , we take all objects and distribute them over their verbs  . This means that we are concerned with all occurrences of an object as a block  , and give the block the score that is the frequency of the object divided by the number of different verbs that appear with the object  . 
The formula is now as follows . Le to be an object and let ( F ~, V ~, o), .   .   .   , ( Fn , V n , o ) be triples where Fj > 0 is the frequency or the relative frequency of the collocation of o as an object of the verb ~ in a corpus  . Then the score for the object o is the sum ~- -1 F ~/ n . 
The frequency of a given object is divided by the number of different verbs taking this given object  . If the number of occurrences of a given object grows  , the score increases . If the object appears with many different verbs , the score decreases . Thus the formula favours common objects that are used in a specific sense in a given corpus  . 
This scheme still needs some parameters.
First , the distribution of the verbs is not taken into account  . The score is the same in the case where an object occurs with three different verbs with the frequencies  , say ,  100 ,  100 , and 100 , and in the case where the frequencies of the three heads are  280  , 10 and 10 . In this case , we want to favour the latter object , because the verb-object relation seems to be more stable with a small number of exceptions  . One way to do this is to sum up the squares of the frequencies instead of the frequencies themselves  . 
Second , it is not clear what the optimal penalty is for multiple verbs with a given object  . This may be parametrised by scaling the denominator of the formula  . Third , we introduce a threshold frequency for collocation so that only the collocations that occur frequently enough are used in the calculations  . This last modification is crucial when an automatic parsing system is applied because it eliminates infrequent parsing errors  . 
The final formula for the distributed frequency DF ( o ) of the object o in a corpus of n triples ( Fj , Vj , o ) with Fj > C is the sum4=1 nb where a , b and C are constants that may depend on the corpus and the parser  . 
4 The corpora and parsing 4 . 1 The syntactic parser
We used the Conex or Functional Dependency Grammar ( FDG ) by Tapanainen and J ~ rvinen ( 1997 ) for finding the syntactic relations . The new version of the syntactic parser can be tested at http://www  , conex or . f i . 
1290 4.2 Processing the corpora
We analysed the corpora with the syntactic parser and collected the verb-object collocations from the output  . The verb may be in the infinitive , participle or finite form . A noun phrase in the object function is represented by its head  . 
For instance , the sentence Isaw a big black cat generates the pair  ( see , cat I . A verb may also have an infinitive clause as its object  . In such a case , the object is represented by the infinitive , with the infinitive marker if present . Naturally , transitive nonfinite verbs can have objects of their own  . Therefore , for instance , the sentence I want to visit Paris generates two verb-objects pairs :  ( want , to visit ) and ( visit , Paris ) . The parse recognises also clauses , e . g . that-clauses , as objects . 
We collect the verbs and head words of nominal objects from the parser's output  . Other syntactic arguments are ignored . The output is normalised to the baseform so that , for instance , the clause He made only three real mistakes produces the normalised pair :  ( make , mistake ) . The tokenisation i the lexical analysis produces some " compound nouns " like vice ? president  , which are glued together . We regard these compounds as single tokens . 
The intricate borderline between an object , object adverbial and mere adverbial nominal is of little importance here  , because the latter tend to be idiomatic anyway . More importantly , due to the use of a syntactic parser , the presence of other arguments , e . g . subject , predicative complement or indirect object , do not affect he result . 
5 Experiments
In our experiment , we used some ten million words from a The Times newspaper corpus  , taken from the Bank of English corpora ( J ~ irvinen ,  1994) . The overall quality of the result collocations i good  . The verb-object collocations with highest distributed object frequencies seem to be very idiomatic  ( Table 1 )  . 
The collocations seem to have different status in different corpora  . Some collocations appear in every corpus in a relatively high position  . For example , collocations like take toll , give birth and make mistake are common English expressions  . 
Some other collocations are corpusspe-

6 Mutual information
Mutual information between a verb and its object was also computed for comparison with our method  . The collocations from The Times with the highest mutual information and hight-value are listed in Table  2  . See Church et al (1994) for further information . We selected the t-value so that it does not filter out the collocations of Table  1  . Mutual information is computed from a list of verb-object collocations  . 
The first impression ~ when comparing Tables 1 and 2  , is that the collocations in the latter are somewhat more margin although clearly semantically motivated  . The second observation is that the top collocations contain mostly rare words and parsing errors made by the underlying syntactic parser  ; three out of the top five pairs are parsing errors  . 
We tested how the top ten pairs of Table 1 are rated by mutual information . The result is in Table 3 where the position denotes the position when sorted according to mutual information and filtered by the t-value  . The t-value is selected so that it does not filter out the top pairs in Table  1  . Without filtering , the positions are in range between 32   640 and 158091  . The result shows clearly how different the nature of mutual information is  . Here it seems to favour pairs that we would like to rule out and vice versa  .

If we collect the most frequent objects for the verb have  , we are answering the question : " What do we usually have ?"  ( see Table 4 )  . The distributed frequency of the object gives a different flavour to the task : if we collect the collocations in the order of the distributed frequency of the object  , we are answering the question : " What do we only have ?"  ( see Table 5 )  . 
8 Conclusion
This paper was concerned with the semantic a symmetry which appears as syntactic asymmetry in the output of a syntactic parser  . This asymmetry is quantified by the presented is -tributed frequency function  . The function can be used to collect and sort the collocation so that the  ( verb-object ) collocations where the asymmetry between the elements i the largest come first  . Because the semantic asymmetry is related to the idiomaticity of the expressions  , we have obtained a fully automated method to find idiomatic expressions from large corpora  .
