Abstract
This paper introduces new methods based on exponential families for modeling the correlations between words in text and speech  . While previous work assumed the effects of word cooccurrence statistics to be constant over a window of several hundred words  , we show that their influence is nonstationary on a much smaller time scale  . Empirical data drawn from English and Japanese text  , as well as conversational speech , reveals that the " attraction " between words decays exponentially  , while stylistic and syntactic on traints create a " repulsion " between words that discourages close cooccurrence  . We show that these characteristics are well described by simple mixture models based on twostage exponential distributions which can be trained using the EM algorithm  . The resulting distance distributions can then be incorporated as penalizing features in an exponential language model  . 
1 Introduction
One of the fundamental characteristics of language  , viewed as a stochastic process , is that it is highly nonstationary . Throughout a written document and during the course of spoken conversation  , the topic evolves , effecting local statistics on word occurrences . The standard trigram model disregards this nonstationarity  , as does any stochastic grammar which assigns probabilities to sentences in a context -independent fashion  .

Stationary models are used to describe such a dynamic source for at least two reasons  . The first is convenience : stationary models require a relatively small amount of computation to train and to apply  . 
The second is ignorance : we know so little about how to model effectively the nonstationary characteristics of language that we have for the most part completely neglected the problem  . From a theoretical standpoint , we appeal to the Shannon-McMillan-Breiman theorem  ( Cover and Thomas ,  1991 ) whenever computing perplexities on test data ; yet this result only rigorously applies to stationary and ergodic sources  . 
To allow a language model to adapt to its recent context  , some researchers have used techniques to update trigram statistics in a dynamic fashion by creating a cache of the most recently seen ngrams which is smoothed together  ( typically by linear interpolation ) with the static model ; see for example ( Jelinek et al , 1991; Kuhn and de Mori ,  1990) . Another approach , using maximum entropy methods similar to those that we present here  , introduces a parameter for trigger pairs of mutually informative words  , so that the occurrence of certain words in recent context boosts the probability of the words that they trigger  ( Rosenfeld ,  1996) . Triggers have also been incorporated through different methods  ( Kuhn and de Mori , 1990; Ney , Essen , and Kneser ,  1994) . 
All of these techniques treat the recontext as a " bag of words  , " so that a word that appears , say , five positions back makes the same contribution to prediction as words at distances of  50 or 500 positions back in the history . 
In this paper we introduce new modeling techniques based on exponential families for capturing the long-range correlations between occurrences of words in text and speech  . We show how for both written text and conversational speech  , the empirical distribution of the distance between trig-"attraction " between words decays exponentially  , while stylistic and syntactic on straints create a " repulsion " between words that discourages close cooccurrence  . 
We have discovered that this observed behavior is well described by simple mixture models based on twostag exponential distributions  . Though in common use in queueing theory , such distributions have not , to our knowledge , been previously exploited in speech and language processing  . It is remarkable that the behavior of a highly complex stochastic proces such as the separation between word cooccurrences i well modeled by such a simple parametric family  , just as it is surprising that Zipf's law can so simply capture the distribution of word frequencies in most languages  . 
In the following section we present examples of the empirical evidence for the effects of distance  . In Section 3 we outline the class of statistical models that we propose to model this data  . After completing this work we learned of a related paper  ( Niesler and Woodland , 1997) which construct similar models . 
In Section 4 we present a parameter estimation algorithm , based on the EM algorithm , for determining the maximum likelihood estimates within the class  . 
In Section 5 we explain how distance models can be incorporated into an exponential language model  , and present sample perplexity results we have obtained using this class of models  . 
2 The Empirical Evidence
The work described in this paper began with the goal of building a statistical language model using a static trigram model as a " prior  , " or default distribution , and adding certain features to a family of conditional exponential models to capture some of the nonstationary features of text  . The features we used were simple " trigger pairs " of words that were chosen on the basis of mutual information  . Figure 1 provides a small sample of the 41 , 263 ( s , t ) trigger pairs used in most of the experiments we will describe  . 
In earlier work , for example ( Rosenfeld ,  1996) , the distance between the words of a trigger pair ( s , t ) plays no role in the model , meaning that the " boost " in probability which t receives following its triggers is independent of how long agos occurred  , so long as s appeared somewhere in the history H , a fixed-length window of words preceding t . It is reasonable to expect , however , that the relevance of a words to the identity of the next word should decay ass falls

further and further back into the context . Indeed , there are tables in ( Rosenfeld , 1996) which suggest that this is so , and distance-dependent " memory weights " are proposed in  ( Ney , Essen , and Kneser ,  1994) . We decided to investigate the effect of distance in more detail  , and were surprised by what we found .

Figure 3: The observe distance distributions -- collected from five million words of the Wall Street Journal corpus -- for one of the non-self trigger groups  ( left ) and one of the selftrigger groups ( right )  . For a given distance 0 < k < 400 oa the z-axis , the value on the y-axis is the empirical probability that two trigger words within the group are separated by exactly k +  2 words , conditional on the event that they cooccur within a  400 word window .   ( We exclude separation of one or two words because of our use of distance models to improve upon trigrams  . ) The set of 41 , 2 63 trigger pairs was partitioned into 20 groups of non-self triggers ( s , t ) , s?t , such as ( Soviet , Kremlin's ) , and 20 groups of self triggers ( s , s ) , such as ( business , business ) . Figure 3 displays the empirical probability that a word t appears for the first time k words after the appearance of its mates in a trigger pair  ( s , t ) , for two representative groups . 
The curves are striking in both their similarities and their differences  . Both curve seem to have more or less flattened out by N =  400  , which allows us to make the approximating assumption  ( of great practical importance ) that word-triggering effects may be neglected after several hundred words  . The most prominent distinction between the two curves is the peak near k =  25 in the self trigger plots ; the non-self trigger plots suggest a monotonic decay  . The shape of the selftrigger curve , in particular the rise between k = 1 and / ? ~25 , reflects the stylistic and syntactic injunctions against repeating a word too so on  . This effect , which we term the lexical exclusion principle , does not appear for non-self triggers . 
In general , the lexical exclusion principle seems to be more in effect for uncommon words  , and thus the peak for such words is shifted further to the right  . 
While the details of the curves vary depending on the particular triggers  , this behavior appears to be universal . For triggers that appear too few times in the data for this behavior to exhibit itself  , the curves emerge when the counts are pooled with those from a collection of other rare words  . An example of this law of large numbers is shown in Figure  4  . 
These empirical phenomena are not restricted to the Wall Street Journal corpus  . In fact , we have observed similar behavior in conversational speech and  . Japanese text . The corresponding data for self triggers in the Switchboardata  ( Godfrey , Holliman , and McDaniel ,  1992) , for instance , exhibits the same bump in p(k ) for small k , though the peak is closer to zero . The lexical exclusion principle , then , seems to be less applicable when two people are convers-ing  , perhaps because the stylistic concerns of written communication are not as important in conversation  . 
Several examples from the Switchboard and Nikkei corpora are shown in Figure  5  . 
3 Exponential Models of Distance
The empirical data presented in the previous ection exhibits three salient characteristics  . First is the decay of the probability of a word t as the distance k from the most recent occurrence of its mates increases  . The most important ( continuous-time ) distribution with this property is the single -parameter exponential family p ~  ( x ) = ~ e : ~ . 
(We'll begin by showing the continuous analogues of the discrete formulas we actually use  , since they are simpler in appearance . ) This family is uniquely characterized by the mernory less properly that the probability of waiting an additiona length of time At is independent of the time elapsed so far  , and Figure 4: The law of large numbers emerging for distance distributions  . Each plot shows the empirical distance curve for a collection of self triggers  , each of which appears fewer than 100 times in the entire 38 million word Wall Street Journal corpus . The plots include statistics for 10 ,  50 , 500 , and all 2779 of the selftriggers which occurred no more than 100 times each .

the distribution p , has mean1/y and variance1/y2 . 
This distribution is a good candidate for modeling non-self triggers  . 
Figure 6: A twostage queue
The second characteristic is the bump between 0 and 25 words for self triggers . This behavior appears when two exponential distributions are arranged in serial  , and such distributions are an important tool in the " method of stages " in queueing theory  ( Klein-rock ,  1975) . The time it takes to travel through two service facilities arranged in serial  , where the first provides exponential service with rate  /~1 and the second provides exponential service with rate  Y2  , is simply the convolution of the two exponentials : #P  . ~ , ~2 ( z ) = Y1Y2e-~':te-~'~ ( =- Od ~_~1~2 ( e-?'=-e-~'~= ) ~ x?/J2 . 

The mean and variance of the twostage exponential p  . , , ,: are 1/# , + l/p2 and 1/y~+1//J ~ respectively . As #1 ( or , by symmetry , P2) gets large , the peak shifts towards zero and the distribution approaches the single-parameter exponential Pu =   ( by shown in Figure 7 .

The twostag exponential is a good candidate for distance modeling because of its mathematical properties  , but it is also well-motivated for linguistic reasons  . The first queue in the twostage model represents the stylistic and syntactic on straints that prevent a word from being repeated too so on  . After this waiting period , the distribution falls off exponentially , with the memory less property . For non-self triggers , the first queue has a waiting time of zero , corresponding to the absence of linguistic constraints against using t soon afters when the words s and t are different  . Thus , we are directly modeling the " lexical exclusion " effect and long-distance de cay that have been observed empirically  . 
The third artifact of the empirical data is the tendency of the curves to approach a constant  , positive value for large distances . While the exponential distribution quickly approaches zero  , the empirical data settles down to a nonzero steady-state value  . 
Together these three features suggest modeling distance with a three-parameter family of distributions := + c  ) where c > 0 and 7 is a normalizing constant . 
Rather than a continuous-time exponential , we use the discrete-time analogue p . ( k ) = (1--t`k In this case , the twostage model becomes the discrete-time convolution k p t = l  , t`2(k ) = ~ p /= l(t)pt ` ~( k--t ) . 

Remark . It should be pointed out that there is another parametric family that is an excellent candidate for distance models  , based on the first two features noted above : This is the Gamma dislribu  .

This distribution has mean a // ~ and variance a // ~   2 and thus can afford greater flexibility in fitting the empirical data  . For Bayesian analysis , this distribution is appropriate as the conjugate prior for the exponential parameter p  ( Gelman et al ,  1995) . Using this family , however , sacrifices the linguistic interpretation of the twostage model  . 
4 Estimating the Parameters
In this section we present a solution to the problem of estimating the parameters of the distance models introduced in the previous section  . We use the maximum likelihood criterion to fit the curves  . Thus , if 0E0 represents the parameters of our model , and /3 ( k ) is the empirical probability that two triggers appear a distance of k words apart  , then we seek to maximize the loglikelihood
C(0) = ~~( k ) log p0(k).

First suppose that PO oE ? is the family of continuous one-stag exponential models p ~  ( k ) = pe-t`k . 
In this case the maximum likelihood problem is straightforward : the mean is the sufficient statistic for this exponential family  , and its maximum likelihood estimate is determined by  1   1 -Ek > ok ~ ( k ) -E~\[k\]"In the case where we instead use the discrete model pt `  ( k )  =  ( 1-e-t ' ) e-t`k , a little algebra shows that the maximum likelihood estimate is then Now suppose that our parametric family POOE ? is the collection of twostag exponential models  ; the loglikelihood in this case becomes ?(/ ~1 , /~2) = ~--~ iS(k ) log pm(j)pt ` , ( k-j ) . 

Here it is not obvious how to proceed to obtain the maximum likelihood estimates  . The difficulty is that there is a sum inside the logarithm  , and direct differentiation results in coupled equations for Pi and volving index j as a hidden variable and apply the EM algorithm  ( Dempster , Laird , and Rubin ,  1977) . 
Recall that the interpretation of j is the time used to pass through the first queue  ; that is , the number of words used to satisfy the linguistic constraints of lexical exclusion  . This value is hidden given only the total time k required to pass through both queues  . 
Applying the standard EM argument , the difference in loglikelihood for two parameter pairs  ( #~ , #~) and (/ tt , #2) can be bounded from below as c ( . ') -= ( ) log(p . :, . ;( . , j ')) / :>_0 j = 0

It appears that the above updates require O ( N2 ) operations if a window of N words is maintained in the history  . However , using formulas for the geometric series , such as ~ k ~ k=0 kz = z/(1-x ) 2 , we can write the expec-k ? tation ~":~ j=o3Pm , ~ , ,(Jlk ) in closed form . Thus , the updates can be calculated in linear time . 
Finally , suppose that our parametric family pc see is the three-parameter collection of twostage exponential models together with an additive constant : p  . ,, . ~, o(k ) = . -~( p .  , ,  . = ( k ) + e) . 
Here again , the maximum likelihood problem can be solved by introducing a hidden variable  . In par-cticular , by setting a "-~ we can express this model as a mizture of a twostag exponential and a uniform distribution : Thus  , we can again apply the EM algorithm to determine the mixing parameter a  . This is a standard application of the EM algorithm  , and the details are omitted . 
In summary , we have shown how the EM algorithm can be applied to determine maximum likelihood estimates of the three-parameter family of distance models Pm  , ~= , a of distance models . In Figure 8 we display typical examples of this training algorithm at work  . 
5 A Nonstationary Language Model
To incorporate triggers and distance models into a long-distance language model  , we begin by constructing a standard , static backoff trigram model ( Katz ,  1987) , which we will denote as q(wo\[w-l , w-2) . For the purposes of building a model for the Wall Street Journal data  , this trigram model is quickly trained on the entire  38-million word corpus . We then build a family of conditional exponential models of the general form p  ( wIH )  = 1  ( =  ) 
Z ~- ff ~ expAifi(H , w)q(wlw_l , w_2) where H = w-t , w2 .   .   .   .   , w_N is the word history , and Z ( H ) is the normalization constant Z ( H ) ~ = E exp ( EAifi ( H ' , q(wlw_l , w2) The functions f l , which depend both on the word history H and the word being predicted  , are called features , and each feature fi is assigned a weight Ai . 
In the models that we built , feature fi is an indicator function , testing for the occurrence of a trigger pair ( si , ti ) : 1 if siEH and w = t if i(H , w ) = 0 otherwise . 
The use of the trigram model as a default distribution  ( Cs is zhr , 1996) in this manner is new in language modeling . ( One might also use the term prior , although q ( w\[H ) is not a prior in the strict Bayesian sense . ) Previous work using maximum entropy methods incorporated trigram constraints as  0  . 012 0 . 01

explicit features ( Rosenfeld ,  1996) , using the uniform distribution as the default model  . There are several advantages to incorporating trigrams in this way  . The trigram component can be efficiently constructed over a large volume of data  , using standard software or including the various sophisticated techniques for smoothing that have been developed  . Furthermore , the normalization Z ( H ) can be computed more efficiently when trigrams appear in the default distribution  . For example , in the case of trigger features , since Z(H ) = 1+~6(siEH)(ex'-1)q(tilw-1 , w-z ) i the normalization involves only a sum over those words that are actively triggered  . Finally , assuming robust estimates for the parameters hl , the resulting model is essentially guaranteed to be superior to the trigram model  . The training algorithm we use for estimating the parameters i the Improved Iterative Scaling  ( IIS ) algorithm introduced in ( Della Pietra , 
Della Pietra , and Lafferty , 1997).
To include distance models in the word predictions  , we treat the distribution on the separation k between sl and t i in a trigger pair  ( si , ti ) as a prior . 
Suppose first that our distance model is a simple one-parameter xponential  , p(kIslEH , w = ti ) =  #ie-m ~ . Using Bayes'theorem , we can then write p(w = ti\[slEH , si = w-A)p(w = ti\[siEH)p(k\[siEH , w = ti ) p ( kIsiEH ) ocex '-"' kq ( tlIwi-l , wi-~) . 
Thus , the distance dependence is incorporated as a penalizing feature  , the effect of which is to discourage a large separation between si and ti  . A similar interpretation holds when the twostage mixture models P  , 1 , ,2 , ~ are used to model distance , but the formulas are more complicated . 
In this fashion , we first trained distance models using the algorithm outlined in Section  4  . We then incorporated the distance models as penalizing features  , whose parameters remained fixed , and proceeded to train the trigger parameters hi using the IIS algorithm  . Sample perplexity results are tabulated in Figure  9  . 
One important aspect of these results is that because a smoothed trigram model is used as a default distribution  , we are able to bucket the trigger features and estimate their parameters on a modest amount of data  . The resulting calculation takes only several hours on a standard workstation  , in comparison to the machine-months of computation that previous language models of this type required  . 
The use of distance penalties gives only a small improvement  , in terms of perplexity , over the baseline trigger model . However , we have found that the benefits of distance modeling can be sensitive to configuration of the trigger model  . For example , in the results reported in Table 9 , a trigger is only allowed to be active once in any given context  . By instead allowing multiple occurrences of a triggers to contribute to the prediction of its mate t  , both the perplexity reduction over the baseline trigram and the relative improvements due to distance modeling are increased  .

The properties of these cooccurrence statistics appear to be exhibited universally in both text and conversational speech  . We presented a training algorithm for this class of distance models based on a novel application of the EM algorithm  . Using a standard backoff trigram model as a default distribution  , we built a class of exponential language models which use non-stationary features based on trigger words to allow the model to adapt to the recent context  , and then incorporated the distance models as penalizing features  . The use of distance modeling results in an improvement over the baseline trigger model  .
