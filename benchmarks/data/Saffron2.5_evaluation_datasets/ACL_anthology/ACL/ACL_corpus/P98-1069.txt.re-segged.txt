1 Introduction
In recent years , there is a phenomenal growth in the amount of online text material available from the greatest information repository known as the World Wide Web  . Various traditional information retrieval ( IR ) techniques combined with natural language processing  ( NLP ) techniques have been re-targeted to enable efficient access of the WWW--search engines  , indexing , relevance feedback , query term and keyword weighting , document analysis , document classification , etc . Most of these techniques aim at efficient online search for information already on the Web  . 
Meanwhile , the corpus linguistic community regards the WWW as a vast potential of corpus resources  . It is now possible to download a large amount of texts with automatic tools when one needs to compute  , for example , a list of synonyms ; or download domain-specific monolingual texts by specifying a keyword to the search engine  , and then use this text to extract domain-specific terms  . It remains to be seen how we can also make use of the multilingual texts as NLP resources  . 
In the years since the appearance of the first papers on using statistical models for bilingual lexicon compilation and machine transla-tion  ( Brown et al , 1993; Brown et al , 1991; Gale and Church , 1993; Church , 1993; Simard et al ,  1992) , large amount of human effort and time has been invested in collecting parallel corpora of translated texts  . Our goal is to alleviate this effort and enlarge the scope of corpus resources by looking into monolingual  , comparable texts . This type of texts are known as nonparallel corpora  . Such nonparallel , monolingual texts should be much more prevalent than parallel texts  . However , previous attempts at using nonparallel corpora for terminology translation were constrained by the inadequate availability of same-domain  , comparable texts in electronic form . The type of nonparallel texts obtained from the LDC or university libraries were often restricted  , and were usually out-of-date as soon as they became available  . For new word translation , the timeliness of corpus resources is a prerequisite  , so is the continuous and automatic availability of nonparallel  , comparable texts in electronic form . Data collection effort should not inhibit the actual translation effort  . Fortunately , nowadays the World Wide Web provides us with a daily increase of fresh  , up-to-date multilingual material , together with the archived versions , all easily downloadable by software tools running in the background  . It is possible to specify the URL of the online site of a newspaper  , and the start and end dates , and automatically download all the daily newspaper materials between those dates  . 
In this paper , we describe a new method which combines IR and NLP techniques to extract new word translation from automatically downloaded EnglishChinese nonparallel newspaper texts  . 
2 Encountering new words
To improve the performance of a machine translation system  , it is often necessary to update its bilingual lexicon  , either by human lexicographers or statistical methods using large corpora  . Upuntil recently , statistical bilingual ex-icon compilation relies largely on parallel corpora  . This is an undesirable constraint at times . 
In using a broadcoverage EnglishChinese MT system to translate some text recently  , we discovered that it is unable to translate ~ , ~ , /li-ougan which occurs very frequently in the text  . 
Other words which the system cannot find in its 20 , 0 00-entry lexicon include proper names and the Hong Kong Chief Executive Tung Chee-Hwa  . To our disappointment , we cannot locate any parallel texts which include such words since they only start to appear frequently in recent months  . 
A quick search on the Web turned up archives of multiple local newspapers in English and Chinese  . Our challenge is to find the translation of ~/ l iougan and other words from this online nonparallel  , comparable corpus of newspaper materials . We choose to use issues of the English newspaper Hong Kong Standard and the Chinese newspaper Mingpao  , from Dec . 12, 97 to Dec . 31,97, as our corpus . The English text contains about 3 Mb of text whereas the Chinese text contains 8  . 8Mb of 2 byte character texts . 
So both texts are comparable in size . Since they are both local mainstream newspapers , it is reasonable to assume that their contents are comparable as well  . 
3YL  ~ , /liougan is associated with flubut not with Africa Unlike in parallel texts  , the position of a word in a text does not give us information about its translation in the other language  . ( Rapp , 1995; Fung and McKeown ,  1997 ) sugges that a content word is closely associated with some words in its context  . As a tutorial example , we postulate that the words which appear in the context of ~/ liougan should be similar to the words appearing in the context of its English translation  , flu . We can form a vector space model of a word in terms of its context word indices  , similar to the vector space model of a text in terms of its constituent word indices  ( Salton and Buckley , 1988; Salton and Yang , 1973; Croft , 1984; Turtle and Croft , 1992; Bookstein ,  1983;
Korfhage , 1995; Jones , 1979).
The value of the ith dimension of a word vector W is f if the ith word in the lexicon appears f times in the same sentences as W  . 
Left columns in Table 1 and Table 2 show the list of content words which appear most frequently in the context of flu and Africa respectively  . The right column shows those which occur most frequently in the context of ~  , ~ ,  . We can see that the context of ~ is more similar to that offluthant o that of Africa  .

In a bilingual corpus , the " common word " is actually a bilingual word pair  . We use the lexicon of the MT system to " bridge " all bilingual word pairs in the corpora  . These word pairs are used as seed words . 
We found that the contexts of flu and ~ , ~/ liougan share 233" common " context words , whereas the contexts of Africa and ~ , ~/ liougan share only 121 common words , even though the context of flu has 491 unique words and the context of Africa has 328 words . 
In the vector space model , W\[flu\]and
W\[liougan\]has 233 overlapping dimensions , whereas there are 121 overlapping dimensions between W\[flu \] and W\[A frica\]  . 
4 15   5 Using TF/IDF of contextual seed words The flu example illustrates that the actual ranking of the context word frequencies provides a second clue to the similarity between a bilingual word pair  . For example , virus ranks very high for both flu and ~ g ~/ l iougan and is a strong " bridge " between this bilingual word pair  . This leads us to use the term frequency ( TF ) measure . The TF of a context word is defined as the frequency of the word in the context of W  . 
( e.g . TF of virus in flu is 26, in ~, ~ is 147).
However , the TF of a word is not independent of its general usage frequency  . In an extreme case , the function word the appears most frequently in English texts and would have the highest TF in the context of any W  . In our HK-Standard/Ming paocrpus , Hong Kong is the most frequent content word which appears everywhere  . So in the flu example , we would like to reduce the significance of Hong Kong's TF while keeping that of virus  . A common way to account for this difference is by using the inverse document frequency  ( IDF )  . Among the variants of IDF , we choose the following representation from ( Jones , 1979): max n
IDF = log--+lni where maxn = the maximum frequency of any word in the corpus ni = the total number of occurrences of word i in the corpus The IDF of virus is  1  . 81 and that of Hong Kong is 1 . 23 in the English text . The IDF of ~, ~ is 1 . 92 and that of Hong Kong is 0 . 83 in Chinese . So in both cases , virus is a stronger " bridge " for ~ , ~ , /liougant han Hong Kong . 
Hence , for every context seed word i , we assign a word weighting factor ( Salton and Buckley ,  1988 ) wi = TFiwxIDFi where TFi w is the TF of word i in the context of word W  . 
The updated vector space model of word W has wi in its ith dimension  . 
The ranking of the 20 words in the contexts of ~/ liouganis rearranged by this weighting factor as shown in  Table3  .

A ranking algorithm selects the best target language candidate for a source language word according to direct comparison of some similarity measures  ( Frakes and
Baeza-Yates , 1992).
We modify the similarity measure proposed by ( Salton and Buckley , 1988) into the following
SO : so(wc , We ) = t . 2 ~/ ~' ~ i = l Wz c where Wic = TFic
Wie=T Fie ~= 1 ( WicX Wie ) t 2 XY\]~i = lWieVariants of similarity measure such as the above have been used extensively in the IR community  ( Frakes and Baeza-Yates ,  1992) . They are mostly based on the Cosine Measure of two vectors  . For different asks , the weighting factor might vary . For example , if we add the IDF into the weighting factor , we get the following measure SI : t
SI(Wc , We ) = ~ i = l(Wic ? Wie)t . 2 t 2 ~/ ~ i = lWzcX~i = lWie where wic = TFicxIDFi
Wie = TFiexIDFi are also suitable similarity measures for document comparison  ( Frakes and Baeza-Yates ,  1992) . We also implement he Dice coefficient into similarity measure  $2: t 2Ei=l   ( WicX Wie ) S2 ( W , W e ) = t . 2 t . 2 ~ i = lW2c"~-~i = lW ~ e where Wic = TFicxIDFi
Wie=T FiexIDFi
S 1 is often used in comparing a short query with a documentext  , whereas $2 is used in comparing two document exts . Reasoning that our objective falls somewhere in between -- we are comparing segments of a document  , we also multiply the above two measures into a third similarity measure  $3  . 
7 Confidence on seed word pairs
In using bilingual seed words such as IN~/virus as " bridges " for terminology translation  , the quality of the bilingual seed lexicon naturally affects the system output  . In the case of European language pairs such as French-English  , we can envision using words sharing common cognates as these " bridges "  . Most importantly , we can assume that the word boundaries are similar in French and English  . However , the situation is messier with English and Chinese . 
First , segmentation of the Chinese text into words already introduce some ambiguity of the seed word identities  . Secondly , EnglishChinese translations are complicated by the fact that the two language share very little stemming properties  , or part-of-speech set , or word order . 
This property causes every English word to have many Chinese translations and vice versa  . In a source-target language translation scenario , the translated text can be " rearranged " and cleaned up by a monolingual language model in the target language  . However , the lexicon is not very reliable in establishing " bridges " between nonparallel EnglishChinese texts  . To compensate for this ambiguity in the seed lexicon  , we introduce a confidence weighting to each bilingual word pair used as seed words  . If a wordie is the k-th candidate for wordic , then wi , ~= wi , ~/ki . 
The similarity scores then become $4 and $5 and $6  =  $4 x $5: ~= l ( Wic?Wie ) /ki
S4(Wc , We ) = t . 2 t 2 ~/ ~ i = lWzc ? ~ i = lWie where wic = TFic ? IDFi
Wie=TFiexIDFi2~=l(WicxWie)/k is 5(wc , we ) = t . 2 t 2 Ei = lWzc + ~ i = lWie where wic = TFicxIDFi wie = TFiexIDFiWe also experiment with other combinations of the similarity scores such as  $7 --- SOx $5  . 
All similarity measures $3  -  $7 are used in the experiment for finding a translation for ~  , ~ ,  . 
8 Results
In order to apply the above algorithm to find the translation for ~/ liougan from the HKS tan-dard /Mingpao corpus  , we first use a script to select the 118 English content words which are not in the lexicon as possible candidates  . Using similarity measures $3-$7 , the highest ranking candidates of ~ are shown in Table  6  .   $6 and $7 appear to be the best similarity measures . 
We then test the algorithm with $7 on more Chinese words which are not found in the lexicon but which occur frequently enough in the Mingpao texts  . A statistical new word extraction tool can be used to find these words  . The unknown Chinese words and their English counterparts  , as well as the occurrence frequencies of these words in HK Standard/Mingpao are shown in Table  4  . Frequency numbers with a * indicates that this word does not occur frequent enough to be found  . Chinese words with a * indicates that it is a word with segmentation and translation ambiguities  . For example , ( Lam ) could be a family name , or part of another word meaning forest . When it is used as a family name , it could be transliterated into
Lamin Cantonese or Linin Mandarin.
D is regarding all entries with a * in the above table  , we apply the algorithm to the rest of the Chinese unknown words and the  118 English unknown words from HK Standard . The output is ranked by the similarity scores . The highest ranking translated pairs are shown in Table  5  . 
The only Chinese unknown words which are not correctly translated in the above list are

Tung/Chee-Hwa is a pair of collocates which is actually the full name of the Chief Executive  . Poultry in Chinese is closely related to flu because the Chinese name for bird fluis poultry flu  . In fact , almost all unambiguous Chinese new words find their translations in the first  100 of the ranked list . Six of the Chinese words have correct translation as their first candidate  .

Some of the early statistical terminology translation methods are  ( Brown et al , 1993; Wu and Xia , 1994; Dagan and Church , 1994; Gale and Church , 1991; Kupiec , 1993; Smadja et al , 1996; Kay and RSscheisen , 1993; Fung and Church , 1994; Fung , 1995b ) . These algorithms all require parallel , translated texts as input . Attempts at exploring nonparallel corpora for terminology translation are very few  ( Rapp , 1995; Fung , 1995a ; Fung and McKeown ,  1997) . Among these , ( Rapp ,  1995 ) proposes that the association between a word and its close collocate is preserved in any language  , and ( Fung and McKeown ,  1997 ) suggests that the associations between a word and many seed words are also preserved in another language  . In this paper , tween a word and its context seed words are well -preserved in nonparallel  , comparable texts of different languages . 
10 Discussions
Our algorithm is the first to have generated a collocation bilingua lexicon  , albeit small , from a nonparallel , comparable corpus . We have shown that the algorithm has good precision  , but the recall is low due to the difficulty in extracting unambiguous Chinese and English words  . 
Better results can be obtained when the following changes are made : ? improve seed word lexicon reliability by stemming and POS tagging on both English and Chinese texts  ; ? improve Chinese segmentation by using a larger monolingual Chinese lexicon  ; ? use larger corpus to generate more unknown words and their candidates by statistical methods  ; We will test the precision and recall of the algorithm on a larger set of unknown words  . 
11 Conclusions
We have devised an algorithm using context seed word TF/IDF for extracting bilingual lexicon from nonparallel  , comparable corpus in EnglishChinese . This algorithm takes into account the reliability of bilingual seed words and is language independent  . This algorithm can be applied to other language pairs such as English-French or EnglishGerman  . In these cases , since the languages are more similar linguistically and the seed word lexicon is more reliable  , the algorithm should yield better results . This algorithm can also be applied in an iterative fashion where high-ranking bilingual word pairs can be added to the seed word list  , which in turn can yield more new bilingual word pairs  .
