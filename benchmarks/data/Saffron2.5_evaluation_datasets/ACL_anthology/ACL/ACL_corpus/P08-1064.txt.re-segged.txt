Abstract
This paper presents a translation model that is based on tree sequence alignment , where a tree sequence refers to a single sequence of subtrees that covers a phrase . The model leverages on the strengths of both phrasebased and linguistically syntaxbased method . It automatically learns aligned tree sequence pairs with mapping probabilities from wordaligned biparsed parallel texts . Compared with previous models , it not only captures nonsyntactic phrases and discontinuous phrases with linguistically structured features , but also supports multilevel structure reordering of tree typology with larger span . This gives our model stronger expressive power than other reported models . Experimental results on the NIST MT2005 ChineseEnglish translation task show that our method statistically significantly outperforms the baseline systems.
1 Introduction
Phrase-based modeling method ( Koehn et al , 2003; Och and Ney , 2004a ) is a simple , but powerful mechanism to machine translation since it can model local reorderings and translations of multiword expressions well . However , it cannot handle long-distance reorderings properly and does not exploit discontinuous phrases and linguistically syntactic structure features ( Quirk and Menezes , 2006). Recently , many syntaxbased models have been proposed to address the above deficiencies ( Wu , 1997; Chiang , 2005; Eisner , 2003; Ding and Palmer , 2005; Quirk et al 2005; Cowan et al , 2006; Zhang et al , 2007; Bod , 2007; Yamada and Knight , 2001; Liu et al , 2006; Liu et al , 2007; Gildea , 2003; Poutsma , 2000; Hearne and Way , 2003). Although good progress has been reported , the fundamental issues in applying linguistic syntax to SMT , such as non-isomorphic tree alignment , structure reordering and nonsyntactic phrase modeling , are still worth well studying.
In this paper , we propose a tree-to-tree translation model that is based on tree sequence alignment . It is designed to combine the strengths of phrasebased and syntaxbased methods . The proposed model adopts tree sequence 1 as the basic translation unit and utilizes tree sequence alignments to model the translation process . Therefore , it not only describes nonsyntactic phrases with syntactic structure information , but also supports multilevel tree structure reordering in larger span.
These give our model much more expressive power and flexibility than those previous models.
Experiment results on the NIST MT2005 ChineseEnglish translation task show that our method significantly outperforms Moses ( Koehn et al , 2007), a state-of-the-art phrasebased SMT system , and other linguistically syntaxbased methods , such as SCFG-based and STSG-based methods ( Zhang et al ., 2007). In addition , our study further demonstrates that 1) structure reordering rules in our model are very useful for performance improvement while discontinuous phrase rules have less contribution and 2) tree sequence rules are able to model nonsyntactic phrases with syntactic structure information , and thus contribute much to the performance improvement , but those rules consisting of more than three subtrees have almost no contribution.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows : Section 2 reviews previous work . Section 3 elabo-1 A tree sequence refers to an ordered subtree sequence that covers a phrase or a consecutive tree fragment in a parse tree.
It is the same as the concept ? forest ? used in Liu et al(2007).
559 rates the modelling process while Sections 4 and 5 discuss the training and decoding algorithms . The experimental results are reported in Section 6. Finally , we conclude our work in Section 7.
2 Related Work
Many techniques on linguistically syntaxbased SMT have been proposed in literature . Yamada and Knight (2001) use noisy-channel model to transfer a target parse tree into a source sentence.
Eisner (2003) studies how to learn non-isomorphic tree-to-tree/string mappings using a STSG . Ding and Palmer (2005) propose a syntaxbased translation model based on a probabilistic synchronous dependency insertion grammar . Quirk et al (2005) propose a dependency treelet-based translation model . Cowan et al (2006) propose a feature-based discriminative model for target language syntactic structures prediction , given a source parse tree . Huang et al (2006) study a TSG-based tree-to-string alignment model . Liu et al (2006) propose a tree-to-string model . Zhang et al (2007b ) present a STSG-based tree-to-tree translation model . Bod (2007) reports that the unsupervised STSG-based translation model performs much better than the supervised one . The motivation behind all these work is to exploit linguistically syntactic structure features to model the translation process . However , most of them fail to utilize nonsyntactic phrases well that are proven useful in the phrasebased methods ( Koehn et al , 2003).
The formally syntaxbased model for SMT was first advocated by Wu (1997). Xiong et al (2006) propose a MaxEnt-based reordering model for BTG ( Wu , 1997) while Setiawan et al (2007) propose a function word-based reordering model for BTG . Chiang (2005)?s hierarchal phrasebased model achieves significant performance improvement . However , no further significant improvement is achieved when the model is made sensitive to syntactic structures by adding a constituent feature ( Chiang , 2005).
In the last two years , many research efforts were devoted to integrating the strengths of phrasebased and syntaxbased methods . In the following , we review four representatives of them.
1) Hassan et al (2007) integrate supertags ( a kind of lexicalized syntactic description ) into the target side of translation model and language model under the phrasebased translation framework , resulting in good performance improvement . However , neither source side syntactic knowledge nor reordering model is further explored.
2) Galley et al (2006) handle nonsyntactic phrasal translations by traversing the tree upwards until a node that subsumes the phrase is reached.
This solution requires larger applicability contexts ( Marcu et al , 2006). However , phrases are utilized independently in the phrasebased method without depending on any contexts.
3) Addressing the issues in Galley et al (2006), Marcu et al (2006) create an xRS rule headed by a pseudo , nonsyntactic nonterminal symbol that subsumes the phrase and its corresponding multi-headed syntactic structure ; and one sibling xRS rule that explains how the pseudo symbol can be combined with other genuine nonterminals for acquiring the genuine parse trees . The name of the pseudo nonterminal is designed to reflect the full realization of the corresponding rule . The problem in this method is that it neglects alignment consistency in creating sibling rules and the naming mechanism faces challenges in describing more complicated phenomena ( Liu et al , 2007).
4) Liu et al (2006) treat all bilingual phrases as lexicalized tree-to-string rules , including those nonsyntactic phrases in training corpus . Although the solution shows effective empirically , it only utilizes the source side syntactic phrases of the input parse tree during decoding . Furthermore , the translation probabilities of the bilingual phrases and other tree-to-string rules are not compatible since they are estimated independently , thus having different parameter spaces . To address the above problems , Liu et al (2007) propose to use forest-to-string rules to enhance the expressive power of their tree-to-string model . As is inherent in a tree-to-string framework , Liu et al?s method defines a kind of auxiliary rules to integrate forest-to-string rules into tree-to-string models . One problem of this method is that the auxiliary rules are not described by probabilities since they are constructed during decoding , rather than learned from the training corpus . So , to balance the usage of different kinds of rules , they use a very simple feature counting the number of auxiliary rules used in a derivation for penalizing the use of forest-to-string and auxiliary rules.
In this paper , an alternative solution is presented to combine the strengths of phrasebased and syn-

Unlike previous work , our solution neither requires larger applicability contexts ( Galley et al , 2006), nor depends on pseudo nodes ( Marcu et al , 2006) or auxiliary rules ( Liu et al , 2007). We go beyond the single subtree mapping model to propose a tree sequence alignment-based translation model . To the best of our knowledge , this is the first attempt to empirically explore the tree sequence alignment based model in SMT.

Fig . 1, Fig . 2 illustrates two examples of tree sequences derived from the two parse trees . A tree sequence translation rule r is a pair of aligned tree sequences r =< 2 i iTS e , A % >, where : z 2 the span [ 1 2,j j ] in 1( )

Fig . 3 shows two rules extracted from the tree pair shown in Fig . 1, where r1 is a tree-to-tree rule and r2 is a tree sequence-to-tree sequence rule . Obviously , tree sequence rules are more powerful than phrases or tree rules as they can capture all phrases ( including both syntactic and nonsyntactic phrases ) with syntactic structure information and allow any tree node operations in a longer span.
We expect that these properties can well address the issues of non-isomorphic structure alignments , structure reordering , nonsyntactic phrases and discontinuous phrases translations.

First , the source sentence is parsed into a source parse tree . Next , the source parse tree is detached into two source tree sequences ( the left hand side of rules in Fig . 3).
Then the two rules in Fig . 3 are used to map the two source tree sequences to two target tree sequences , which are then combined to generate a target parse tree . Finally , a target translation is yielded from the target tree.
Our model is implemented under loglinear framework ( Och and Ney , 2002). We use seven basic features that are analogous to the commonly used features in phrasebased systems ( Koehn , 2004): 1) bidirectional rule mapping probabilities ; 2) bidirectional lexical rule translation probabilities ; 3) the target language model ; 4) the number of rules used and 5) the number of target words . In addition , we define two new features : 1) the number of lexical words in a rule to control the model?s preference for lexicalized rules over unlexicalized rules and 2) the average tree depth in a rule to balance the usage of hierarchical rules and flat rules.
Note that we do not distinguish between larger ( taller ) and shorter source side tree sequences , i.e . we let these rules compete directly with each other.
4 Rule Extraction
Rules are extracted from wordaligned , biparsed sentence pairs 1 1( ), ( ),
J IT f T e A < > , which are classified into two categories : z initial rule , if all leaf nodes of the rule are terminals ( i.e . lexical word ), and z abstract rule , otherwise , i.e . at least one leaf node is a nonterminal ( POS or phrase tag).
Given an initial rule 2 2 1 1 ( ), ( ), j ij iTS f TS e A < >% , its sub initial rule is defined as a triple 4 4 3 3 ?( ), ( ), j ij iTS f TS e A < > if and only if : z 4 4 3 3 ?( ), ( ), j ij iTS f TS e A < > is an initial rule.
z 3 4 3 4( , ) : i j A i i i j j j ? ? ? ? ? ? ?% , i.e.
A ? A ? % z 4 j jTS f while ( ) iiTS e is a subgraph of 21( ) i iTS e .
Rules are extracted in two steps : 1) Extracting initial rules first.
2) Extracting abstract rules from extracted initial rules with the help of sub initial rules.
It is straightforward to extract initial rules . We first generate all fully lexicalized source and target tree sequences using a dynamic programming algorithm and then iterate over all generated source and target tree sequence pairs 2 2 1 1 ( ), ( ) j ij iTS f TS e < > . If the condition ? ( , ) i j ? 1 2 1 2:A i i i j j j ? ? ? ? ? ? ? is satisfied , the triple 2 2 1 1 ( ), ( ), j ij iTS f TS e A < >% is an initial rule , where A % are alignments between leaf nodes of 2 i iTS e . We then derive abstract rules from initial rules by removing one or more of its sub initial rules . The abstract rule extraction algorithm presented next is implemented using dynamic programming . Due to space limitation , we skip the details here . In order to control the number of rules , we set three constraints for both finally extracted initial and abstract rules : 1) The depth of a tree in a rule is not greater 2) The number of nonterminals as leaf nodes is not greater than c .
3) The tree number in a rule is not greater than d.
In addition , we limit initial rules to have at most seven lexical words as leaf nodes on either side.
However , in order to extract long-distance reordering rules , we also generate those initial rules with more than seven lexical words for abstract rules extraction only ( not used in decoding ). This makes our abstract rules more powerful in handling global structure reordering . Moreover , by configuring these parameters we can implement other translation models easily : 1) STSG-based model when 1d = ; 2) SCFG-based model when 1d = and 2h = ; 3) phrasebased translation model only ( no reordering model ) when 0c = and 1h = .

Algorithm 2 illustrates the decoding algorithm . It translates each span iteratively from small one to large one ( lines 12).
This strategy can guarantee that when translating the current span , all spans smaller than the current one have already been translated before if they are translatable ( line 7). When translating a span , if the usable rule is an initial rule , then the tree sequence on the target side of the rule is a candidate translation ( lines 45). Otherwise , we replace the nonterminal leaf nodes of the current abstract rule with their corresponding spans ? translations that are already translated in previous steps ( line 7). To speed up the decoder , we use several thresholds to limit search beams for each span : 1) ? , the maximal number of rules used 2) ? , the minimal log probability of rules 3) ? , the maximal number of translations yield It is worth noting that the decoder does not force a complete target parse tree to be generated . If no rules can be used to generate a complete target parse tree , the decoder just outputs whatever have pothesis.
6 Experiments 6.1 Experimental Settings
We conducted Chinese-to-English translation experiments . We trained the translation model on the FBIS corpus (7.2M+9.2M words ) and trained a 4gram language model on the Xinhua portion of the English Gigaword corpus (181M words ) using the SRILM Toolkits ( Stolcke , 2002) with modified Kneser-Ney smoothing . We used sentences with less than 50 characters from the NIST MT2002 test set as our development set and the NIST MT2005 test set as our test set . We used the Stanford parser ( Klein and Manning , 2003) to parse bilingual sentences on the training set and Chinese sentences on the development and test sets . The evaluation metric is case-sensitive BLEU4 ( Papineni et al , 2002). We used GIZA ++ ( Och and Ney , 2004) and the heuristics ? grow-diag-final ? to generate m-to-n word alignments . For the MER training ( Och , 2003), we modified Koehn?s MER trainer ( Koehn , 2004) for our tree sequence-based system . For significance test , we used Zhang et als implementation ( Zhang et al 2004).
We set three baseline systems : Moses ( Koehn et al ., 2007), and SCFG-based and STSG-based tree-to-tree translation models ( Zhang et al , 2007). For Moses , we used its default settings . For the SCFG/STSG and our proposed model , we used the same settings except for the parameters d and h ( 1d = and 2h = for the SCFG ; 1d = and 6h = for the STSG ; 4d = and 6h = for our model ). We optimized these parameters on the training and development sets : c =3, ? =20, ? =-100 and ? =100.
6.2 Experimental Results
We carried out a number of experiments to examine the proposed tree sequence alignment-based translation model . In this subsection , we first report the rule distributions and compare our model with the three baseline systems . Then we study the model?s expressive ability by comparing the contributions made by different kinds of rules , including strict tree sequence rules , nonsyntactic phrase rules , structure reordering rules and discontinuous phrase rules2. Finally , we investigate the impact of maximal subtree number and subtree depth in our model . All of the following discussions are held on the training and test data.

It shows that : 1) We verify that the BPs are fully covered by the initial rules ( i.e . lexicalized rules ), in which the lexicalized TSRs model all nonsyntactic phrase pairs with rich syntactic information . In addition , we find that the number of initial rules is greater than that of bilingual phrases . This is because one bilingual phrase can be covered by more than one initial rule which having different subtree structures.
2) Abstract rules generalize initial rules to unseen data and with structure reordering ability . The number of the abstract rule is far less than that of the initial rules . This is because leaf nodes of an abstract rule can be nonterminals that can represent any subtrees using the nonterminals as roots.
Fig . 4 compares the performance of different models . It illustrates that : 1) Our tree sequence-based model significantly outperforms ( p < 0.01) previous phrasebased and linguistically syntaxbased methods . This empirically verifies the effect of the proposed method.
2) Both our method and STSG outperform Moses significantly . Our method also clearly outperforms STSG . These results suggest that : z The linguistically motivated structure features are very useful for SMT , which can be cap-2 To be precise , we examine the contributions of strict tree sequence rules and single tree rules separately in this section.

564 tured by the two syntaxbased models through tree node operations.
z Our model is much more effective in utilizing linguistic structures than STSG since it uses tree sequence as basic translation unit . This allows our model not only to handle structure reordering by tree node operations in a larger span , but also to capture nonsyntactic phrases , which circumvents previous syntactic constraints , thus giving our model more expressive power.
3) The linguistically motivated SCFG shows much lower performance . This is largely because SCFG only allows sibling nodes reordering and fails to utilize both nonsyntactic phrases and those syntactic phrases that cannot be covered by a single CFG rule . It thereby suggests that SCFG is less effective in modelling parse tree structure transfer between Chinese and English when using Penn Treebank style linguistic grammar and under word-alignment constraints . However , formal SCFG show much better performance in the formally syn-tax-based translation framework ( Chiang , 2005).
This is because the formal syntax is learned from phrases directly without relying on any linguistic theory ( Chiang , 2005). As a result , it is more robust to the issue of nonsyntactic phrase usage and non-isomorphic structure alignment.

Table 2: Contributions of TSRs ( see Table 1 for the definitions of the abbreviations used in this table ) Table 2 measures the contributions of different kinds of tree sequence rules . It suggests that : 1) All the three kinds of TSRs contribute to the performance improvement and their combination further improves the performance . It suggests that they are complementary to each other since the lexicalized TSRs are used to model nonsyntactic phrases while the other two kinds of TSRs can generalize the lexicalized rules to unseen phrases.
2) The lexicalized TSRs make the major contribution since they can capture nonsyntactic phrases with syntactic structure features.

Table 3 shows the contributions of SRR and DPR . It clearly indicates that SRRs are very effective in reordering structures , which improve performance by 1.45 (26.07-24.62) BLEU score.
However , DPRs have less impact on performance in our tree sequence-based model . This seems in contradiction to the previous observations3 in literature . However , it is not surprising simply because we use tree sequences as the basic translation units . Thereby , our model can capture all phrases.
In this sense , our model behaves like a phrasebased model , less sensitive to discontinuous phras-3 Wellington et al (2006) reports that discontinuities are very useful for translational equivalence analysis using binary-branching structures under word alignment and parse tree constraints while they are almost of no use if under word alignment constraints only . Bod (2007) finds that discontinues phrase rules make significant performance improvement in linguistically STSG-based SMT models.
565 es ( Wellington et al , 2006). Our additional experiments also verify that discontinuous phrase rules are complementary to syntactic phrase rules ( Bod , 2007) while nonsyntactic phrase rules may compromise the contribution of discontinuous phrase rules . Table 4 reports the numbers of these two kinds of rules . It shows that around 30% rules are shared by the two kinds of rule sets . These overlapped rules contain at least two nonterminal leaf nodes plus two terminal leaf nodes , which implies that longer rules do not affect performance too much.

Fig . 5 studies the impact when setting different maximal tree depth ( h ) in a rule on the performance . It demonstrates that : 1) Significant performance improvement is achieved when the value of h is increased from 1 to 2. This can be easily explained by the fact that when h = 1, only monotonic search is conducted , while h = 2 allows nonterminals to be leaf nodes , thus introducing preliminary structure features to the search and allowing nonmonotonic search.
2) Internal structures and large span ( due to h increasing ) are also useful as attested by the gain of 0.86 (26.14-25.28) Blue score when the value of h increases from 2 to 4.
Fig . 6 studies the impact on performance by setting different maximal tree number ( d ) in a rule . It further indicates that : 1) Tree sequence rules ( d >1) are useful and even more helpful if we limit the tree depth to no more than two ( lower line , h=2). However , tree sequence rules consisting of more than three subtrees have almost no contribution to the performance improvement . This is mainly due to data sparseness issue when d >3.
2) Even if only two-layer subtrees ( lower line ) are allowed , our method still outperforms STSG and Moses when d>1. This further validates the effectiveness of our design philosophy of using multi-sub-trees as basic translation unit in SMT.
7 Conclusions and Future Work
In this paper , we present a tree sequence align-ment-based translation model to combine the strengths of phrasebased and syntaxbased methods . The experimental results on the NIST MT2005 ChineseEnglish translation task demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model . Our study also finds that in our model the tree sequence rules are very useful since they can model nonsyntactic phrases and reorderings with rich linguistic structure features while discontinuous phrases and tree sequence rules with more than three subtrees have less impact on performance.
There are many interesting research topics on the tree sequence-based translation model worth exploring in the future . The current method extracts large amount of rules . Many of them are redundant , which make decoding very slow . Thus , effective rule optimization and pruning algorithms are highly desirable . Ideally , a linguistically and empirically motivated theory can be worked out , suggesting what kinds of rules should be extracted given an input phrase pair . For example , most function words and headwords can be kept in abstract rules as features . In addition , word alignment is a hard constraint in our rule extraction . We will study direct structure alignments to reduce the impact of word alignment errors . We are also interested in comparing our method with the forest-to-string model ( Liu et al , 2007). Finally , we would also like to study unsupervised learning-based bilingual parsing for SMT.
