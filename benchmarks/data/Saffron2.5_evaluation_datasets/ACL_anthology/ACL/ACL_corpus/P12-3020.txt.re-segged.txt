Twitter has become a central site where people express their opinions and views on political parties and candidates . Emerging events or news are often followed almost instantly by a burst in Twitter volume , providing a unique opportunity to gauge the relation between expressed public sentiment and electoral events . In addition , sentiment analysis can help explore how these events affect public opinion . While traditional content analysis takes days or weeks to complete , the system demonstrated here analyzes sentiment in the entire Twitter traffic about the election , delivering results instantly and continuously . It offers the public , the media , politicians and scholars a new and timely perspective on the dynamics of the electoral process and public opinion.
1 Introduction Social media platforms have become an important site for political conversations throughout the world . In the year leading up to the November 2012 presidential election in the United States , we have developed a tool for realtime analysis of sentiment expressed through Twitter , a microblogging service , toward the incumbent President , Barack Obama , and the nine republican challengers - four of whom remain in the running as of this writing . With this analysis , we seek to explore whether Twitter provides insights into the unfolding of the campaigns and indications of shifts in public opinion . Twitter allows users to post tweets , messages of up to 140 characters , on its social network . Twitter usage is growing rapidly . The company reports over 100 million active users worldwide , together sending over 250 million tweets each day ( Twitter , 2012). It was actively used by 13% of online American adults as of May 2011, up from 8% a year prior ( Pew Research Center , 2011). More than two thirds of U.S . congress members have created a Twitter account and many are actively using Twitter to reach their constituents ( Lassen & Brown , 2010; TweetCongress , 2012). Since October 12, 2012, we have gathered over 36 million tweets about the 2012 U.S . presidential candidates , a quarter million per day on average . During one of the key political events , the Dec 15, 2011 primary debate in Iowa , we collected more than half a million relevant tweets in just a few hours . This kind of ? big data ? vastly outpaces the capacity of traditional content analysis approaches , calling for novel computational approaches . Most work to date has focused on post-facto analysis of tweets , with results coming days or even months after the collection time . However , Choy et al , 2011; Tumasjan et al , 2010; Zeitzoff , 2011). For example , Tumasjan (2010) found tweet volume about the political parties to be a good predictor for the outcome of the 2009 German election , while Choy et al (2011) failed to predict with Twitter sentiment the ranking of the four candidates in Singapore?s 2011 presidential election . Past studies of political sentiment on social networks have been either posthoc and/or carried out on small and static samples . To address these issues , we built a unique infrastructure and sentiment model to analyze in realtime public sentiment on Twitter toward the 2012 U.S . presidential candidates . Our effort to gauge political sentiment is based on bringing together social science scholarship with advanced computational methodology : our approach combines realtime data processing and statistical sentiment modeling informed by , and contributing to , an understanding of the cultural and political practices at work through the use of Twitter . 3 The System For accuracy and speed , we built our realtime data processing infrastructure on the IBM?s InfoSphere Streams platform ( IBM , 2012), which enables us to write our own analysis and visualization modules and assemble them into a realtime processing pipeline . Streams applications are highly scalable so we can adjust our system to handle higher volume of data by adding more servers and by distributing processing tasks . Twitter traffic often balloons during big events ( e.g . televised debates or primary election days ) and stays low between events , making high scalability strongly desirable . Figure 1 shows our system?s architecture and its modules . Next , we introduce our data source and each individual module.

Recordeddata idiosyncratic uses , such as emoticons , URLs , RT for retweet , @ for user mentions , # for hashtags , and repetitions . It is necessary to preprocess and normalize the text . As standard in NLP practices , the text is tokenized for later processing . We use certain rules to handle the special cases in tweets . We compared several Twitter-specific tokenizers , such as TweetMotif ( O'Connor et al , 2010) and found Christopher Potts ? basic Twitter tokenizer best suited as our base . In summary , our tokenizer correctly handles URLs , common emoticons , phone numbers , HTML tags , twitter mentions and hashtags , numbers with fractions and decimals , repetition of symbols and Unicode characters ( see Figure 2 for an example ). 3.3 Sentiment Model The design of the sentiment model used in our system was based on the assumption that the opinions expressed would be highly subjective and contextualized . Therefore , for generating data for model training and testing , we used a crowdsourcing approach to do sentiment annotation on indomain political data . To create a baseline sentiment model , we used Amazon Mechanical Turk ( AMT ) to get as varied a population of annotators as possible . We designed an interface that allowed annotators to perform the annotations outside of AMT so that they could participate anonymously . The Turkers were asked their age , gender , and to describe their political orientation . Then they were shown a series of tweets and asked to annotate the tweets ' sentiment ( positive , negative , neutral , or unsure ), whether the tweet was sarcastic or humorous , the sentiment on a scale from positive to negative , and the tweet author's political orientation on a slider scale from conservative to liberal . Our sentiment model is based on the sentiment label and the sarcasm and humor labels . Our training data consists of nearly 17000 tweets (16% positive , 56% negative , 18% neutral , 10% unsure ), including nearly 2000 that were multiply annotated Tweet WAAAAAH !!!

The output tokens of a sample tweet from our tokenizer ( Figure 3) to display volume and sentiment by candidate as well as trending words and system statistics . The dashboard pulls updated data from a web server and refreshes its display every 30 seconds . In Figure 3, the topleft bar graph shows the number of positive and negative tweets about each candidate ( right and left bars , respectively ) in the last five minutes as an indicator of sentiment towards the candidates . We chose to display both positive and negative sentiment , instead of the difference between these two , because events typically trigger sharp variations in both positive and negative tweet volume . The topright chart displays the number of tweets for each candidate every minute in the last two hours . We chose this time window because a live-broadcast primary debate usually lasts about two hours . The bottomleft shows system statistics , including the total number of tweets , the number of seconds since system start and the average data rate . The bottomright table shows trending words of the last five minutes , computed using TFIDF measure as follows : tweets about all candidates in a minute are treated as a single ? document ?; trending words are the tokens from the current minute with the highest TFIDF weights when using the last two hours as a corpus ( i.e ., 120 ? documents ?). Qualitative examination suggests that the simple TFIDF metric effectively identifies the most prominent words when an event occurs . The dashboard gives a synthetic overview of volume and sentiment for the candidates , but it is often desirable to view selected tweets and their sentiments . The dashboard includes another page Figure 3. Dashboard for volume , sentiment and trending words establish an online feedback loop between users and the sentiment model , so users ? judgment serves to train the model actively and iteratively . 4 System Evaluation In Section 3.3, we described our preliminary sentiment model that automatically classifies tweets into four categories : positive , negative , neutral or unsure . It copes well with the negative bias in political tweets . In addition to evaluating Figure 5. Dashboard for most positive , negative and frequent tweets Figure 4. Online sentiment annotation interface and accurate picture of the online political landscape . Our realtime data processing infrastructure and statistical sentiment model evaluates public sentiment changes in response to emerging political events and news as they unfold . The architecture and method are generic , and can be easily adopted and extended to other domains ( for instance , we used the system for gauging sentiments about films and actors surrounding Oscar nomination and selection ).
