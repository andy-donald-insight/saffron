Intersentent Aale Aliptica A utterances occur frequently in information-seeking d ielogues  . This paper presents a pragmatics-based framework for interpreting such utterances  , ~ncluding identAfi-cation of the spoa~r ' s discourse ~ oel in employing the fra~ent  . We claim that the advantage of this approach is its reliance upon pragmatic information  , including discourse content and conversational goals  , rather than upon precise representations of the preceding utterance alone  . 

The fraRmentary utterances that are common in communication between humans also occur in man -Nachi ~ eOOmmUlLC cation  . Humans perslat in using abbreviated statements and queries  , even in the presence o/explicit and repeated instructions to adhere to syntactically and semantically complete sentences  ( Carbonell ,  1983 ) ? Thus a robust natural langua@e interface must handle ellipsis  . 
We have studied one class of elliptical utterances  , Intersentential fragments , in the context of an Information-seek lng dialogue  . As noted by Allen (1980) , such utterances differ from other forms of ellipsis in that interpretation often depends more heavily upon the speaker's inferred underlying task-related plan than upon preceding syntactic forms  . For example , the f cllowlng elliptical fra@ment can only be interpreted within the context of the speaker's goal as communicated in the first utterance : \ [   EX1 \] a T want to cash this check . 
Smell bills only .*
Furthermore , intersententiel fragments are often employed to communicate discourse  8oals   , such as expressing doubt , which a syntactically complete form of the same utterance may not convey as effectively  . In the following alternative responses to the initial statement by SPEAKER-I  ,   F1 expresses doubt regarding the proposition seated by  3PEAEZB-I whereas F2 merely asks about the jet's contents .

Previous research on ellipsis has neglected to address the speaker's discourse Eoals in employing the frasment butreel understanding requires that these be identified  ( Mann , Moore , and Levin , 1977) ( Webber , PoZlack , and Hirschberg ,  1982) . 
In this paper , we investlgate a framework for interpreting Intersentent lalellips is that occurs in task -or lented dialogues  . This framework includes : \[1\]   \[2\] a context mechanism ( Carberry , 1983) that builds the information-seeker , sunderlying plan as the dialogue progresses and differentiates be ~ een local and global contexts  . 
a discourse component that controls the interpretation of ellipsis based upon discourse goal expectations ~ eaned from the dialo@ue  ; this component " understands " ellipsis by identifying the " discourse goal which the speaker is pursuing by employing the elliptical fragment  , and by determining how the frasment should be interpreted relative to that goal  . 
\ [3\] an analysis component that suggests possible associations o ? an elliptical fragment with aspects of the inferred plan for the information -seeker  . 
\[4\] an evaluation component which ,   51yen multiple possible associations o ? an elliptical frag-ment with aspects of the information -seeker  , sunderlying plan , selects that ansociation most appropriate to the discourse context and believed to be intended by the speaker  . 
INTERPRETATIONOFINTERS~qTENTIAL ~ LLTPSISAs Lt lust rated by \[  EX1\]  , intersententiel eA1ipt icaA fra@ments cannot be fully understood in and of themselves  . Therefore a strate8~ for interpreting suc~fra@ments must rely on knowledge obtained frcl sources other than the fragment itself  . Three possibilities exist : the syntactice eTa . ~ nfr ' ~ Flowers and Dyer ( 198~ ) representation of preceding utterances , and expectations gleaned from understanding the preceding disQourse  . 
The first two strategies are exemplified by the work oCCarbo soll and Hayes  ( 1983 )  , Hendrlx , Sacerdot ? , and Sloc , ~( 1976) , Waltz (1978) , and Velschedel and 3 on dhelmer (1982) . Several limitations exist in these approaches , includiug an ina-bilit 7 to handle utterances that rely upon an assumed communication of the underlying task and difficulty in resolving ambiguity="oug multiple interpretations  . Consider the following two dislo~e sequences :
SPEAE~R : " I want to take abus.
The cost ?"
SPEAKER : " I want to purchase abus.
The cost ?"
Z fasemantic strategy is employed , the case frame representation for " bus " may have a " cost of bus " and a " cost of bustic ket " slot  ; a ~ hlgulty arises regard lug to which slot the elliptical fr~sment " The cost ? " refers  . Althou ~ one might suggest extensions far handling this fra~ent  , a semantic strategy alone does not provide an adequate frame ~- wurk for Interpreting intersentential ellipsis  . 
The third potential strategy utilizes a model c ~ the information-seeker's inferred tank-related plan and discourse ~ oals  . The power of this approach is its reliance upon pragmatic information  , including discourse content and converse-tion a ~ goals  , rather than upon precise representations of the preceding utterances alone  . 
Allen ( 1980 ) was the first to relate ellipsis process lug to the domain-dependent plan underlying a speaker's utterance  . All enviews the speaker's utterance as part of a plan which the speaker has constructed and is executlug to accomplish his overall task-related goals  . To interpret elliptical fragments , Allen first constructs a set of possible surface speech act representations for the elliptical fragment  , limited by syntactic clues appearing within the fragment  . The task-related ~ oals which the speaker might pursue form a set  o1" expectations , and Allen attempts to infer the speaker's ~ al -related plan which resulted in execution of the observed utterance  . A part of this inference process involves determining which of the partially constructed plans connecting expectations  ( goals ) and obeerved utterance are ' reasonable given the knovled ~ and mutual beliefs of the speaker and hearer  . Allen selects the surface speech act which produced the most reasonable inferred plan as the correct interpretation  . 
All ennotes that the speaker's fragment must identif7 the subg ~ als which the spea~er is pursu-Lug , but claims that in very restricted dmaains , identifying the speaker's overall ~ from the utterancels sufficient to identify the appropri-ate response in terms of the obstacles present in such a plan  . For his restricted do ~ aln involving train arrivals and departures  , Allen's Interprets-tlon strategy vurke well . In more complex domains , it Is necessary to identify the particular aspect of the speaker's overall task-related plan addressed by the clliptl cal frasment in order to interpret It properly  . More recently , Litman and Allen ( 198 q ) have extended Allen's model to a hierarchy of task-plans and meta-plans  . Litman is currently studying the interpretation of elliptical frasments within this enhanced framework  . 
In addition to the syntactic , semantic , and plan-based strategies , a few other heuristics have been utili zed  . Carbusoll ( 1983 ) uses discourse expectation rules that suggest a set of expected user utterances and rela teelliptical f~a~ents to these expected patterns  . For example , if the sys-t ~ a asks the user whether a parti cular value should be used an the filler o ? a slot in a case frane  , the system then expects the user's utterance to contain a confirmation or disson ~ Irmatlon pattern  , a different filler for the slot , a comparative pattern such as " too hard " , and so forth . 
Although these rules use expectations about how the speaker m~ght respond  , they seem to havellt-tle to do with the expected discourse goals of the speaker  . 
Real understanding consists sot only of resognlz Ar ~ the particular surface-request or surface -lnform  , but also of inferring what the speaker wants to accomplish and the relationship of each utterance to this task  . Interpretation of ellipsis based upon the speaker 's inferred under ~ lying task-related plan and discourse Eoals facilitates a richer interpretation of elliptical utterances  . 
REQUISITEKNCWLEDGE
A speaker can felicitously employ intersen-tentlal ellipsis only L fhebe lieves his utterance will be properly understood  . The motivation for this work is the hypothesis that speaker and hearer mutually believe that certain knowledge has been acquired during the course of the dialogue and that this factual knowledge along with other processing knowledge will be used to deduce the speaker  , s intentions . We claim that the requisite factual knowledge includes the speaker  , s inferred task-related plan , the speaker's inferred beliefs , and the anticipated discourse Eo ala of the speaker  ; We claim that the requisite processing knowledge includes plan recognlt lonstrategies and focuslng techniques  . 
1. Task-Related Plan
In a cooperative information-seeking dAelo -gue  , the ln ~ ormation-provider is expected to in fer their ~ ors ~ ation-seeker  , sunderlying task-related plan an the dia logue pro ~- eases  . At any point An the dialo ~ e , ZS ( the information-seeker ) believes that so a esubset of this plan has been coemun A-mated to IP  ( the in ~ ormation-provider )   ; therefore Y ~ fee Aa Juatl . rled in ~ or mu Aating utterances under the assumption that IP will use this inferred task model to interpret utterances  , includ ID gelliptl-eLL frasment e . 

An example will illustrate the importance of IS's inferred task-related plan in interpreting ellipsis  . In the following , IS is conslder i ~ purchase of a home mentioned earlier in the dialo-~ue : IS : " What elementary schooldo children in Rolling Hills attend ? " 
ZP : " They attend Castle Elementary."
IS : " Any nearby seim clubs ?"
An informal poll indicates that most people interpret the last utterance as a request for swim clubs near the property under consideration in Rolling Hills and that the reason for such an interpretation is their inference that IS is investigating recreational facilities that might be used if IS were to purchase the home  . However , if we substitute the frasment ? An ~ nearby day care centers ?" for the last utterance in the dialogue  , then interpretation depen~up on whether one believes IS wants hls/her children to be bused  , or perhaps even walk , today care directly from school . 
2. Shared Beliefs
Shared beliefs of facts , beliefs which the listener believes speaker and i is tecer mutually hold  , are a second component of factual knowledge required for processing intersentential elliptical  fra6ments   . These shared beliefs either represent presueed a priori knowledge of the domain  , such as a pres~ptl on that dialogue participants in a unAvereity domain know that each course has a teacher  , or beliefs derived from the dialogue itself . An e~ple of the latter occursi ~ IP tells IS that  C3360 is a 5 credit hour course ; IS may not himself believe that C3360 is a 5 credit hour course , but as a result of IP's utterance , he does believe it is mutually believed that IP believes this  . 
Understanding utterances requires that we identify the speaker's discourse goal in making the utterance  . Shared beliefs , often called mutual beliefs , form a part of communicated knowledge used to in terp retutterances and iden-tify discourse goals in a cooperative dlalogue  . 
The following e ~ a ~ leillustrates how IP's beliefs about IS influence us derstan ~ Ing  . 
IS : " Who is teaching C ~ O0 ?"
IP:"Dr . Brown is teaching C.~O 0."
IS:"Atni~t ? "
The frasmentar ~ utterance " At ni ~ t ? " is a request to know whether  CS~O0 is meeting at night . Hc~-ever , if one precedes the above utterances with a quer ~ who serms ~ onse informs IS that  CS~O0 meets only at ni~t , then the last utterance , ? At ni ~ t ? = becomes an objection and request for corroboration or e~lanatlon  . The reason for this difference in interpretation is the difference in beliefs regarding IS at the time the elliptical fragment is uttered  . In the latter case , IP believes it As mutually believed that IS already knows IP's beliefs regarcling when  C/~O0 meets , so a request for that informatlon is not felicitous and a different intention or discourse goal is attributed to L ~  . 
Allen and Perrault ( 1980 ) used mutual beliefs in their work on indirect speech acts and sug-~sted their use in clarification and correction dlalogues  . ~ idner ( 1983 ) models user beliefs about system capabilities in her work on recognlzlng speaker intention in utterances  . 
3. Anticipated Discourse Goals
The speaker's anticipated discourse goals form a third compocent of factual knowledge required for processing elliptical frasment a  . The dlalogue precedlng an elliptical utterance may sugEest discourse goals for the speaker  ; these sugEested discourse g cals become shared knowledge between speaker and hearer  . As a result , the listener is on the look out for the speaker to pur-sue these anticipated discourse goals and inter ~ ~ rets utterances accordingly  . 
Consider for example the following dialogue :
IP : " Have you taken C3 105 or C3 170 ?"
I ~: witthe Unlversity of Delaware ?"
IP : " No , anywhere."
IS : " Yes , at Penn State."
In this example , IP's in lt~al query produces a strong anticipation that IS will pursue the discourse  8oal of provldlng the requested i ~ forma-tlon . There/ore subsequent utterances are interpreted with the expectation that IS will eventually address this  8oal   . IS's first utterance is interpreted as ~ u-suln g a discourse Eoal of seeking clarification of the question posed by IP  ; IS's last utterance ansMers the initial query posed by IP  . However discourse expect at lons do not persist for ever with intervening utterances  . 
. Processing ~ owled p
P 1 an-recognltlon strategies and focusing techniques are necessary components of processing knowledge for interpreting intersentent lal eillpsis  . Plan-recognltion strategies are essential I- order to In/era model of the speaker's underlying task-related plan and focusing tech -niqces are necessary in order to ident ID i that portion of the underlying plan to which a  frasmen-tar7 utterance refers . 
Focusing mechan A as have been employed by Gross ( 1977 ) in identifying the referents of defin-i te noun phrases  , by Robinson ( 1981 ) in interpret-ing verb p ~ vases , by ~ ner (1981) in anaphora resolution , by CarberrT (1983) in plan inference , and by McKeown ( 19 fl ~ ) in naturallan & uage genera-t ~ on . 

FRAme WORKFOR PROCESSING ELLIPSLS
If an utterance is parsed as a sentence fragment , ellipsis processing begins . A model of any preceding dialogue contains a context tree  ( Carberry ,  1983 ) corresponding to IS's inferred underlying task -related plan  , a space containing IS's anticipated discourse goals  , and a belief model representing IS's inferred beliefs  . 
Our framework is a topdown strategy which uses the informat lon-seeker's anticipated discourse goals to guide interpretation of the fragment and relate it to the underlying task-related plan  . The discourse component first analyzes the top element of the discourse stack and suggests potential discourse goals which IS might be expected to pursue  . The plan analysis component uses the context tree and the belief model to suggest possible associations of the elliptical fragment with aspects of IS's inferred task-related plan  . If multiple associations are suggested , the evaluation component applies focusing strategies to select the interpretation believed intended by the speaker---namely  , that most appropriate to the current focus of attention in the dialogue  . The discourse component then uses the results produced by the analysis component to determine if the fragment accomplishes the proposed discourse goal  ; if so , it interprets the fragment relevant to the identified discourse goal  . 
PLAN-ANALY SISCOMPONENT
I . Association of Fragments
The plan-analysls component is responsible for associating an elliptical fragment with a term or conjunction of propositions in Is's underlying task-related plan  . The analysis component determines , based upon the . current focus of attention , the particular aspect of the plan highlighted by IS's fragment and the discourse goal rules infer hcwIS in tends the fra@Rent to be interpreted  . 
This paper will discuss three classes of elliptical fragments  ; a description of how other fragments are associated with plan elements is provided in  ( Carberry ,  1985) . 
A constant fragment can only associate with terms whose semantic type is the same or a superset of the semantic type of the constant  . Furthermore , each term has a limited set of valid instan -tlations within the existing plan  . A constant associates with a term only if IP's beliefs indicate that IS might believe that the uttered constant is one of the te  . ,-m's valid instantiations . 
For example , if a plan contains the proposition
Starting-Date(AI-CONF , JAN/5 ) the elliptical fragment ? February 2?" wall associate w ~ th this proposition only if IP believes  I3 might believe that the starting date for the AS conference is in February  . 
Recourse to such a belief model is necessary in order to allow for Yes No questions to which the answer is " No " and yet eliminate potential associations which a human listener would reCOg -nize as unlikely  . Although this discarding of possible associations does not occur often in interpreting elliptical fragments  , actual human dialogues indicate that it is a real phenomenon  . 
(Sidner ( 1981 ) employs a similar strategy in her work on anaphora resolution  . A co-specifler proposed by the focusing rules must be confirmed by an inference machine  ; if any contradications are detected , other co-specifiers are suggested . ) A propositional fragment can be of two types . 
The first contains a proposition whose name is the same as the name of a proposition in the plan domain  . The second type is a more general propositional fragment which cannot be associated with a specific plan-based proposition until after analyzing the relevant propositions appearing in IS's plan  . The semantic representations of the " utterances " Taught by Dr  . Smith ? "" With Dr . Smith ? " would produce respectively the type I and type  2 propcsitions
Teaches (_ as : & SECTIONS , SMITH)
Genpred ( SMITH)
The latter indicates that the name of the specific plan proposition is a syet unknown but that one of its parameters must associate with the constant 
Smlth.
A proposition of the first type associates with a proposition of the same name if the parameters of the propositions associate  . A proposition of the second type associates with any proposition whose ~ arameters include terms associating with the known parameters of the propositional fragment  . 
The semantic representation of a term such as " The meeting time ?" is a variable term_~me : & MTG-TMES Such a term associates with terms of the same semantic type in IS's plan  . Note that the exlst-ing plan may contain constant instantiatlons in place of former varia Oles  . A term fragment still associates with such constant terms  . 
2. Results of Plan-Analysis Component
The plan-analysis component constructs a conjunction of propositions PLPREDS and/orate rmPLTERM representing that aspect of the informatlon-seeker's plan highlighted by the elliptical fragment  ; STERM and SPREDS are produced by substituting into PLTERM and PLPREDS the terms in IS's fragment for the terms with which they are associated in IS's plan  .

Figure I : A Portion of the Expanded Context Tree for It appears that h  , - , ans retain as much of the established context as possible in interpreting intersentent lal ellipsis  . Carbonell ( 1983 ) demonstrated this phemonenon in an informal poll in which users were found to interpret the fraRment in the followlng dialogue as retaining the fixed media specification : " What is the size of the  3 largest single port fixed media disks ? "" disks with two ports ? " We have noted the same phenomenon in a student advisement domain  . 
Thus when an elliptical fragment associates with a portion of the task-related plan or an expansion of one of its actions  , the context esta-bll shed by the preceding dlalogue must be used to replace information deleted from this streamlined  , frae ~ mentary utterance . The set of ACTIVE nodes in the context model form a stack of plans  , the toP-most of whlca is the current focused plan  ; each of these plans is the expanslon of an action appearing in the plan Immediately beneath it in this stack  . These ACTIVE nodes represent the established Elobal context within w ~ ich the fragmentary utterance occurs  , and the propositions appeaclng along this path contain information missing fr cathe sentence fragment but  ; ~' esumed understood by the speaker . 
If the elliptical fragment ls a proposi tion  , the analysis component produces a conjunct ion of propositions  3PREI ~ representing that aspect ot the plan hi ~ hii ~tedbYIS'sel ! iptl calfra ~ ent  . 
EXAM ~ E-I
If the elliptical fragment is a constant , term , or term with attached propositions , the analysis component produces a term STERM associated with the constant or term in the fraRment as well as a con-Junction of propositions SPREDS  . SPREDS consists of all propositions along the paths from the root of the context tree to the nodes at which an element of the frasment is associated with a plan element  , as well as all propositions appearing along the previous ACTIVE path  . The former represent the new context derived from IS's  frs4-mentary utterance whereas the latter retain the previously established global context  . 
3. E~mple
This example illustrates how the plan-analysis component determines that aspect of IS's plan hi ~llg~ted by an elliptical fragment  . It also shows how the established context is main -rained in interpreting ellipsis  .

EVALUATION COMPONENT
The analysis component proposes a set of potential associations of the elliptical fragment with elements of IS's underlying task-related plan  . The evaluation component employs focusing strategies to select what it believes to be the interpretation intended by  13 --- namely , that interpretation most relevant to the current focus of attention in the dialogue  . 
We employ the notion of focus domains in order to group finely grained actions and associated plans into more general related structures  . 
A focus domain consists of a set of actions , one of which is an ancestor of all other actions in the focus domain and is called the root of the focus domain  . If as action is a member of a focus domain and that action is not the root action of another focus domain  , then all the actions con-taln adin the plan associated with the first action are also members of the focus domain  . 
(This is similar to Grosz's focus spaces and the notion of an object being in implicit focus  . ) The use o f focus domains a l lows the group in8 together of those actions that appear to be at approximately the sa~melevel of Impll cit focus when a plan is explicitly focused  . For example , the actions of learn lr ~ from a particular teacher  , learning the material in a given text , and attend-Ing class will all reside at the same focus level within the expanded plan for earning credit in a course  . The action of going to the cashler's office to payone'stuition also appears within this expanded plan  ; however it will reside at a different focus level since it does not come to mind nearly so readily when one thinks about taking a course  . 
The following are two of seven focusing rules used to select the association deemed most relevant to the existing plan context  . 
\[ F1\]Within the current focus space , prefer asso-clatlons which occur within the current focused plan  . 
I F2\] Within the current focus space and current focused plan  , prefer associations within the actions to achieve the most recently considered action  . 
DISCOURSEGOALS
We have analyzed dialogues from several different domains and have identified eleven discourse goals which occur during information-seeking dialogues and which may be accomplished via elliptical fragments  . Three exemplary discourse goals are \[ ; \] Obtaln-In/ormatlon : IS requests Ir . formatlon relevant to constructing the underlying task-related plan or relevant to formulating an answer to a question posed by IP  . 
\ [2\] Obtaln-Corroboration : IS expresses surprise regarding some proposition P and requests elaboration upon and justification of it  . 
\ [33 Seek-Clarify-quest lon:IS requests information relevant to clarifying a question posed by ZP  . 
ANTICIPATEDDIS COURSEGOALS
When ISm~es an utterance , he is attempting to accomplls ~ a discourse goal ; this discourse goal may in turn predict other suD sequent discourse goals for IS  . For e~ple , if I~asks a question , one anticipates that IS may want to expand upon his question  . Similarly , utterances made by IP suggest dlso oursegoals for LS  . These Aatlcipated Discourse Goals provide very strong expectations for IS and may often be accomplished implicitly as well as explicitly  . 
The discourse ~ als of the previous section also serve as anticipated discourse goals  . Three additional anticipated discourse goals appeart O play a major role in determining how elliptical fragments are interpreted  . One such anticipated discourse ~ alis : IS ; IS must now accept the question either explicitly  , implicitly , or indicate that he does not as yet accept it . 
Normally dialogue participants accept such questions implicitly by proceding to answer the question or to seek information relevant to formulating an answer  . However IS may refuse to accept the question posed by IP because he does not understand It  ( perhaps he is unable to identify some of the entities mentioned in the question  ) or because he is surprised by it . This leads to discourse goals such as seeking confirmation  , seeking the identity of an entity , seeking clarif-ication of the posed question , or expressing surprise at the question . 
THEDISCOURSESTACK
The discourse stack contains anticipated discourse goals which IS is expected to pursue  . 
Anticipated discourse goals are pushed onto or popped from the stack as a result of utterances made by IS and IP  . We have identified a set of stack processing rules which hold for simple utterances  . Three examples of such stack process-
Ing rules are :\[ SP1\]When IP asks a question of IS , Answer-Question and Accept-Quest lonare pushed onto the discourse stack  . 
\[ SP2\] When IS poses a question to IP , Expand-Question is pushed onto the discourse stack  . 
Once IP begins answering the question , the stack is popped up to and including the
Expand-Quest londis course goal.
\ [SP3\]When IS's utterance does not pursue a goal sugEested by the top entry on the discourse stack  , this entry is popped from the stack . 
The motivation for these rules is the following.
When IP asks a question of IS , IS is first expected to accept the question , either implicitly or expll cltly , and then answer the question . Upon posing a question to ~ P , IS is expected to expand upon this question with subsequent utterances or waitu~tll IP produces an answer to the question  . 
Alt ~ oug ~ the strongest expectations are that IS will pursue a goal suggested by the top element of the discourse stack  , this anticipated discourse goal can be passed over  , at which point it no longer sug~sts expectations for utterances  . 
DISCOURSEINTER PRETATIOM COMPOM~T
The discourse component employs discourse expectation rules and discourse goal rules  . The discourse expectation rules use the discourse stack to suggest possible discourse goals for L ~ and activate the associated discourse goal rules  . 
These disnourse goal rules ttse the plan-analys is component to help determine the best interpretation of the  fra~entar7 utterance relevant to the sug~sted discourse goal  . If a discourse goal rule succeeds in producing an interpretation  , then the discourse component identifies that discourse goal and its associated interpretation as its understanding of the utterance  . 
I . Discourse Expectation Rules
The top element of the discourse stack activates the discourse expectation rule with which it is associated  ; this rule in turn suggests discourse goals which the information-seeker's utterance may pursue and activates these discourse goal rules  . The following is an example of a discourse expectation rule :\[  DE1\]If the top element of the discourse stack is
Answer-Question , then
I . Apply discourse goal rule DG-Answer-Quest to determine if the elliptical fragment is being used to accomplish the discourse goal of answering the question  . 
2 . If no interpretation is produced , apply rule S-Suggest-Answer-Quest lonto determine if the elliptical fragment is being used to accomplish the discourse goal of suggesting an answer to the question  . 
3 . If no interpretation is produced , apply discourse goal rule DG-Obtaln-Infoto determine if the elliptical fragment is being used to accomplish the discourse goal of seeking information in order to construct an answer to the posed question  . 
Once IS understands the question posed to him , IP's strongest expectation is that IS will answer the question  ; therefore first preference is given to interpretations which accomplis ~ this goal  . If IS does not immediately answer the question , then we expect a cooperative dialogue participant to work towards answering the question  . This entails gathering information about the underlying task-related plan in order to construct a response  . 
2. Discourse Goal Rules
Discourse goal rules determine if an ell lptl-cal fragment accomplishes the associated discourse goal and  , if so , produce the appropriate interpretation of the fragment  . These discourse goal rules use the plan-analysls component to help determine the best interpretation of the frasmen-tary utterance relevant to the suggested discourse goal  . However these interpretations are not actual representations of surface speech acts  ; instead they generally indicate elements of the plan whose values the speaker is querying or specifying  . In many respects , this provides a better " understanding " of the utterance since it describes what the speaker is trying to accom-pli ~  . 
The following is an example of a rule associated with a discourse goal suggested by the stack entry Accept-Response  ; the latter is pushed onto the discourse stack when IP responds to a question posed by IS  . 


The discourse component calls the plan-analysis component to associate the elliptical fragment with a term STERM or a conjunction of propositions SPREDS in IS's underlying task -related plan  . If IP believes it is mutually believed that IS already knows IP's beliefs about the value of the term STERM or the truth of the propositions $ PREDS  , then identify the elliptical fragment as accomplishing the discourse ~ al of expressing surprise at the preceding response  ; in par-tlcular , IS is surprised at the known values of STEP = Mor SPREDS in li@~t of the new infor-met  . lonprovided by IP's preceding response and the known aspect queried by IS's fragment  .

If the elliptical fragment terminates with a period  , then the discourse component calls the plan -analysls component to associate the elliptical frasment with a conjunction of propositions SPEEDS in IS's underlying task-related plan  . If successful , interpret the elliptical fragment as answer lr ~" Yes "  , with the restriction that the propositions SPREDS besatlsfi ~ d in the underly in ~  . i ~ n . 
IMPLE~NTATION AND EXAMPLES
This pragmatics-based framework for processing intersentent lalellipsis has been implemented for a subset of discourse goals in a domain  con-slstln8 of the courses , policies , and requlrements for students at a unlverslty . The following are worklng examples from this implementation  . 
The ellipsis processor is presented with a semantic representation of Is's elliptical fragment  ; it " understands " intersentent lalelliptical utterances by  Identlfyin8 the discourse goal which I ~ is pursuing in employing the frasment and by producing a plar  , -Oased interpretation relevant to this discourse goal  . 
Thise , -=mple illustrates a simple request for information  . 
IS:"IsCS 360 offered in Fall 19857"
IP : " Yes."
IS : " Doany sections meet on Monday ?"
IP : " One section of C3360 meets on Monday at qPM and another section meets on Monday at  7PM   .  "
IS : " The text ?"
Immediately prior to IS's elliptical utter- . ante , the discourse stack contair ~ the entries
A crept-Response

The discourse goal rules sugEested by Accept -Response do not identify the fragment as accomplishing their associated discourse Eoals  , so the top entry of the discourse stack is popped  ; this indicates that IS has implicitly accepted IP 's response  . The entry Obtaln-Informatlon on the discourse stack activates the rule DG-Obtaln-In/'o  . 
Plan-analysls is activated to associate the elliptical fragment with an aspect of I$'s task -related plan  . The construction of 5TERM and SPREDS for this ezample was described in detail in the plan analysis section and will not be repeated here  . Since our belief model indicates that IS does not currently know the value of STERM such that SPREDS is satisfied  , this rule identifies the elliptical fragment as seeking information in order to formulate a task -related plan  ; in particular , I-~ is request lng the value of STERM such that SPREDS is satisfied---namely  , the textbook used in sections of C3360 that meet on Monday in the Fall of 1985  . 
This example illustrates an utterance in which IS is surprised by IP's response and see~s elaboration and corroboration of it  .   ( The construction of $ PREDS by the plan analysis component will not be described since it is similar to EXAMPLE-I  . ) IS : " I want to take CS 620 in Fall 1985 . 
Who is teaching it ? "
IF : " Dr . Smithisteaching CS 620 in Fall 1985."
IS : " What time does CS 620 meet ?"
IP:"C ? ~20 meets at SAM."
IS : " With Dr . Smlth ? "
I ~' selliptical fragment will associate with the term Teaches  ( _fat-&FACULTY , _ss:&SECTIONS ) in IS's task-related plan . SPREDS will contain the propositions
Course-Offered ( CS 620, FALL 85)
Is-Section-Of (_s s : & SECTIONS , CS 620)
Is-Offered (_s s : & SECTI0NS , gALL 85)
Is-Syllabus-Of (_s s : & ZECTIONS , _syi:&SYLBI )

A Portion of the Expanded Context Tree for EXAMPLE-3 response . The discourse goal rules Seek-Conflrm and Seek -Identlfy fail to identify their associated discourse goals as accomplished by the user's fragment  . 
Ou ~ belief model indicates that IS already knows that SPREDS is satisfied  ; therefore the discourse goal rule DG-Obtain -Corrob identifies the elliptical fragment as expressing surprise at and requesting corroboration of IP's response  . In particular , IS is surprised that SPRED ~ is satisfied and this surprise is a result of \[ I \] the new information presented in IP's preceding response  , namely that 8AM is the value of the term_tae:&MTG-T~S in the SPREDS proposition Is-Mtg-Tiae  ( _s s : & SECTIONS , _tme:~T ~ S )   C2\] the aspect of the plan queried by IS's elliptical fra~ent  , namely the SPREDS proposition
Teaches ( SMITH ,_s s : & SECTIONS )

The following is an example which our framework handles but which poses problems for other  stra-te61es  . 
IS:"I want to register for a course.
But I massed pre-reglstration.
The cost ?"
The first two utterances establish a plan context of late-reglstering  , within which the elliptical fra~ent requests the fees involved in doing so  . 
( Late registration generally involves extra chargos  .   ) Figure 2 presents a portion of 13' sunderlying task-related plan Inferred fr cathe utterances preceding the elliptical frasment  . The parenthesized numbers preceding actions indicate the action's focus domain  . I ~' s fragment associates with the term_ireg : & MONEY in IS's inferred plan  , as well as with terms elsewhere in the plan . However none of the other terms appear in the same focus space as the most recently considered action  , and therefore the association of the fragment with_lreg:&MONEY is selected as most relevant to the current dlalo-gue context  . The discourse stack immediately prior to the elliptical  fra6ment contains the single entry
Provide-For-Assimilatlon
This anticipated discourse goal suggests the discourse goals of  1   ) providing further in for a at lon for assimilation and  2  ) see ~ Ing information in order to formulate the task -related plan  . The utterance terminates in a "?" , ruling out provide for assimilation . Therefore rule DG-Obtaln-Info identifies the elliptical fragment as seeking information  . In particular , the user is requesting the feef or late registration  , namely , the value of the term_cstl : & MONEY such that SPREDS is satisfied  , where SPREDSIs the conjunction of the propositions Course-Offered  ( _crs : & COURSE , _sea : & SEMESTERS ) Is-Sect lon-Of ( _s s : & SECTIONS , _sem : & SE ) ~ STERS ) Is-Offered ( _s s : & SECTIONS , _sem : & SEmeSTERS )
Costs ( LATE-Rwn ., _cstl:&MONEY )
The main limitation of this pragmatics-based framework appears to be in handling Intersenten -t lalelliptical utterances such as the following : 
IS : " Who is the teacher of C3200?"
IF : " Dr . Herd is the teacher of C3 200."
IS:"C32637"
Obviously IS's elliptical fragment requests the teacher of  C3263  . Our model cannot currently handle such fragments . This limitation is partially due to the fact that our mechanlems for retaining dialogue context a rebased upon the view that IS constructs a plan for a task in a dept b-flrst fash lon  , completing Investlgation of a plan for C3200 before moving onto investigate a plan for CS263  . Since the teacher of C3200 has nothing to do with the plan for taking C3263  , the mechanisms for retaining dialogue context will fail to identify ? teacher of  CS263" as the information requested by IS . 
One might argue that the elliptical fragment in the above dialogue relies heavily upon the syntactic representation of the preceding utterance and thus a syntactic strategy is required for interpretation  . This may be true . However if we view dialogues such as the above as investigating task-related plans in a kind of " breadth-flrst " fa ~ hlon  , then IS is analyzing the teachers of each course under consideration first  , and will then move to considering other attributes of the courses  . It appears that the plan-based framework can be extended to handle many such dialogues  , perhaps by using meta-plans to represent how IS is constructing his task-related plan  . 
CONCLUSIONS
This paper ha~described a pragmatlcs-based approach to interpreting intersentent lal elliptical utterances during an information -seeking dialogue in a task doms in  . Our framework coordl-n are smany knowledge sources  , including the informat lon-seeker's inferred task-related plan  , his inferred beliefs , his anticipated discourse goals , and focusing strategies to produce a rich interpretation of ellipsis  , including identification of the Ir ~ ormatlon -seeker's d/scourse goal  . 
This framework can handle many e-~mples w blch pose problems for other strate ~ Les  . We claim that the advantage of tbls approach is its reliance upon pragmatic information  , including discourse content and conversational goals  , rather than upon precise representations of the preceding utterance alone  .
