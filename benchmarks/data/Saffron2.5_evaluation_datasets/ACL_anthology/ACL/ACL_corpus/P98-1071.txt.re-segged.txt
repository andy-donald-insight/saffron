This paper presents a method for extracting subcorpora documenting different subcategorization frames for verbs  , nouns , and adjectives in the 100 mio . word British National Corpus . The extraction tool consists of a set of batch files for use with the Corpus Query Processor  ( CQP )  , which is part of the IMS corpus work bench(cf . Christ 1994a , b) . 
A macro processor has been developed that allows the user to specify in a simple input file which subcorporare to be created for a given lemma  . 
The resulting subcorpora can be used ( 1 ) to provide evidence for the subcategorization properties of a given lemma  , and to facilitate the selection of corpus lines for lexicographic research  , and ( 2 ) to determine the frequencies of different syntactic on texts of each lemma  . 

A number of resources are available for obtaining subcategorization iformation  , i . e . 
information on the types of syntactic complements associated with valence-bearing predicators  ( which include verbs , nouns , and adjectives ) . This information , also referred to as valence information is available both in machine-readable form  , as in the COMLEX database ( Macleod et al 1995) , and in human-readable dictionaries ( e . g . Hornby 1989, Procter 1978, Sinclair 1987) . Increasingly , tools are also becoming available for acquiring subcategorization iformation from corpora  , i . e . for inferring the subcategorization frames of a given lemma  ( e . g . Manning 1993) . 
None of these resources provide immediate access to corpus evidence  , nor do they provide information on the relative frequency of the patterns that are listed for a given lemma  . 
There is a need for a tool that can ( 1 ) find evidence for subcategorization patterns and ( 2 ) determine their frequencies in large corpora : 1 . Statistical approaches to NLP rely on information not just on the range of combinatory possibilities of words  , but also the relative frequencies of the expected patterns  . 
2 . Dictionaries that list subcategorization frames often list expected patterns  , rather than actual ones . Lexicographers and lexicologist need access to the evidence for this information  . 
3 . Frequency information has come to be the focus of much psycholinguistic research on sentence processing  ( see for example MacDonald 1997 )  . While information on word frequency is readily available  ( e . g . Francis and Kucera (1982)) , there is as yet no easy way of obtaining information from large corpora on the relative frequency of complementation patterns  . 
None of these points argue against the usefulness of the available resources  , but they show that there is a gap in the available information  . 
To address this need , we have developed a tool for extracting evidence for subcategorization patterns from the  100 mio . word British National Corpus ( BNC ) . The tool is used a span of the lexicon-building process in the FrameNet project  , an NSF-funded project aimed at creating a lexical database based on the principles of Frame Semantics  ( Fillmore 1982 )  . 
4281 Infrastructure 1.1 Tools
We are using the 100 mio . word British
National Corpus , with the following corpus query tools : ? CQP ( Corpus Query Processor , Christ (1994)) , a general corpus query processor for complex queries with any number and combination of annotated information types  , including part-of-speech tags , morphosyntactic tags , lemmas and sentence boundaries . 
? Amacro processor for use with CQP that allows the user to specify which subcorporare to be created for a given lemma  . 
The corpus queries are written in the CQP corpus query language  , which uses regular expressions over part-of -speech tags  , lemmas , morphosyntactic tags , and sentence boundaries . For details , see Christ (1994a ) . 
The queries essentially simulate a chunk parser , using a regular grammar . 
1.2 Coverage
A list of the verb frames that are currently searchable is given in figure  1 below , along with an example of each pattern . The categories we are using are roughly based on those used in the COMLEX syntactic dictionary  ( Macleod et al 1995 )  . 
intransitive ' worms wiggle ' np'kissme'np_np ' brought herflowers ' np_pp're placed it with a new one ' np_Pvping ' prevented him from leaving ' np_p wh'asked her about what it all meant'np_vpto'advised hertogo'np_vping ' kept them laughing ' np_sfin ' told them  ( that ) he was back'np_wh'asked him where the money
Was'np_ap'considered himfoolish'np_sbrst' had him cleanup ' ap ' turned blue ' figure  1: searchable In our queries for nouns and adjectives as targets  , we are able to extract prepositional , clausal , infinitival , and gerundial complements . 
In addition , the tool accomodates searches for compounds and for possessor phrases  ( my neighbor's addiction to cake , my milk allergy ) . 
Even though these categories are not tied to the syntactic subcategorization frames of the target lemmas  , they often instantiate semantic arguments , or , more specifically , Frame elements ( Fillmore 1982 , Baker et al forthcoming ) . 
1.3 Method 1.3.1 Overview
We start by creating a subcorpus containing all concordance lines for a given lemma  . We call this subcorpus a lemma-subcorpus . The extraction of smaller subcorpora from the lemma subcorpus then proceeds in two stages  . 
During the first stage , syntactic patterns involving ' displaced ' arguments  ( i . e . ' left isolation ' or ' movement ' phenomena ) are extracted , such as passives , tough movement and constructions involving WH -extraction  . 
The result of this procedure is a set of subcorpora that are homogeneous with respect to major constituent order  . Following this , the remainder of the lemma-subcorpus is partitioned into subcorpora based on the subcategorization properties of the lemma in question  .

Where an explicit context cue exists , a partial parse suffices . For example , the query given in figure 2 below is used to find \[_NP VPing \] patterns ( e . g . kept them laughing ) . Note that the query does not positively identify a noun phrase in the ~ osition follow in encoding \[$ search_b  , ,\] \[ pos!="V . *lCJC

However , the information that the target verb subcategorizes for a gerund dramatically reduces the number of such errors  . 
The same mechanism is used for addressing the problems associated with prepositional phrase attachment  . The general principle is that prepositional phrases in certain contexts are considered to be embedded in a preceding noun phrase  , unless the user specifies that a given preposition is subcategorized for by the target lemma  . For example , the of-phrase in a sequence Verb-NP-of-NP is interpreted as part of the first NP  ( as in met the president of the company )  , unless we are dealing with a verb that has a \ [_NPPP of \] subcategorization frame  , e . g . cured the president of his a sthma . 
1.3.4 Cascading queries
The result of each query is subtracted from the lemma subcorpus and the remainder submitted to the next set of queries  . As a result , earlier queries pre-empt later queries . For example , concordance lines matching the queries for passives  , e . g . he was cured of his a sthma are filtered out early on in the process  , so as to avoid getting matched by the queries dealing with  ( active intransitive ) verb+prepositional phrase complements , such as he boasted of his achievements . 
Another example of this type of preemption concerns the interaction of the query for ditransitive frames  ( broughther flowers ) with later queries for NP complements . A proper name immediately followed by another proper name  ( e . g . Henry James ) is interpreted as a single noun phrase except when the target lemma subcategorizes for a ditransitive frame t  . 
An analogou strategy is used for identifying noun compounds  . For ditransitives , trings that represent wo consecutive noun phrases are queried for first  . Note that this method crucially relies on the fact that the subcategorization properties of the target lemma are given as the input to the query process  . 
2 Examples 2.1 NPs
An example of a complex query expression of the kind we are using is given in figure  3  . The expression matches noun phrases like " the three kittens "  , " poor Mr . Smith " , " all three " , " bluef lowers " , " an unusually large hat " , etc .

A macro processor has been developed 2 that allows the user to specify in a simple input file which subcorpora are to be created for a given lemma  .

The subcorpora can be saved as binary files for further processing in CQP or XK WIC  , an interactive corpus query tool ( Christ 1994 ) and as text files . The text files are 5 Limitations of the approach Our tool relies on subcategorization if ormation as its input  . Hence it is not capable of automatically learning subcategorization frames  , e . g . ones that are missing in diction-2 Our macro processor was developed by Collin Baker ( ICSI-Berkeley ) and Douglas Roland ( Uof Colorado , Boulder ) . 
431 aries or omitted in the input file . The tool facilitates the ( manual ) discovery of evidence for new subcategorization frames  , however , as potential complement patterns are saved in separate subcorpora  . Indeed , this is one of the ways in which the tool is being used in the context of the FrameNet project  . 
Some of the technical imitations of the existing tools result from the fact that we are working with an unparsed corpus  . Thus , many types of ' null ' or ' empty ' constituents 3 are not recognized by the queries . Ambiguities in prepositional phrase attachment are another major source of errors  . For instance , of the concordance lines supposedly instantiating a\[_NPPP with \] frame for the verb heal  , several in fact contained embedded PPs ( e . g . \[_NP\] , as in heal\[children with a sthma\] , rather than \[_NPPP with \] , as in healing\[arthritis\]\[with a crystal ball \]  )  , Finally , the search results can only be as accurate as the part-of-speech tags and other annotations in the corpus  . 
7 Future directions
Future versions of the tool will include searches for predicative  ( vs . attributive ) uses for adjectives and nouns . For verbs , the searches will be expanded to cover the entire set of complementation patterns described in the COMLEX syntactic dictionary  . 

We have presented an overview of a set of tools for extracting corpus lines illustrating subcategorization patterns of nouns  , verbs , and adjectives , and for determining the frequency of these patterns  . The tools are currently used as part of the FrameNet project  . An overview of the whole project can be found at : http://www  . icsi . berkeley . edu/~framenet .
