Abstract. Part-whole relations are important in many domains, but typically receive less attention than subsumption relation. In this paper we describe a method
for finding part-whole relations. The method consists of two steps: (i) finding
phrase patterns for both explicit and implicit part-whole relations, and (ii) applying these patterns to find part-whole relation instances. We show results of
applying this method to a domain of finding sources of carcinogens.

1 Introduction

A plethora of existing vocabularies, terminologies and thesauri provide key knowledge
needed to make the Semantic Web work. However, in using these sources witinin one
context, a process of alignment is needed. This has already been identified as a central
problem in semantic-web research. Most aligment approaches focus on finding equivalence and or subclass relations between concepts in diffeent sources. The objective of
this paper is to identifying alignment relations of the part-whole type. Part-whole relations play a key role in many application domains. For example, part-whole is a central
structuring principle in artefact design (ships, cars), in chemistry (structure of a sub-
stance) and medicine (anatomy). The nature of part-whole has been studied in the area
of formal ontology (e.g., [1]). Traditionally, part-whole receives much less attention
than the subclass/subsumption relation.

The main objective of this paper is to develop a method for learning part-whole relations from existing vocabularies and text sources. Our sample domain is concerned
with food ingredients. We discuss a method to learn part-whole relations by first learning phrase patterns that connect parts to wholes from a training set of known part-whole
pairs using a search engine, and then applying the patterns to find new part-whole rela-
tions, again using a search engine. We apply this method in a use case of assisting safety
and health researchers in finding sources of carcinogenic substances using Google. We
evaluate the performance of the pattern-learning and the relation-learning steps, with
special attention to the performance of patterns that implicitly mention part-whole re-
lations. Furthermore we perform an end-to-end task evaluation to establish whether our
method accomplishes the task.

In Sec. 2 we describe the use case on which we evaluate end-to-end performance
and pose performance criteria. In Sec. 3 we discuss the experimental set-up we use to
learn part-whole relations. In Secs. 4 and 5 we describe the learning and application
of patterns to find part-whole relations and evaluate the performance of the patterns in

terms of Precision. In Sec. 6 we evaluate Recall on four sample carcinogens. Sec. 7
discusses related work. We conclude with a discussion of the results and open research
questions in Sec. 8.

2 Use Case

An important application area of part-whole learning is health and safety research. Experts in this field are faced with hard information retrieval tasks on a regular bases.
News of a benzene spill in a river, for example, will trigger questions like Is the general publics health in danger?, Are there any foodstuffs we should avoid?, and Are
there any occupational risks, fishermen perhaps?. The first task the health and safety
researchers are faced with is to find out via which pathways the substance in question
can reach humans. Only then can they investigate if any of these pathways apply to the
current situation. A sizable part of this problem can be reduced to finding all part-whole
relations between the substance and initially unknown wholes in scientific literature and
reports from authorities in the field such as the United States Food and Drugs Administration1 (FDA) and Environmental Protection Agency2 (EPA), and the World Health
Organization3 (WHO).

The wholes should be possible routes through which humans can be exposed to the
substance. For example, tap water, exhaust fumes, or fish. We will not go into detail
discussing the roles these concepts play that leads to the actual exposure. For example,
when humans are exposed to benzene in fish by eating the fish, fish assumes the role
of food. Relevant part-whole relations can be of any of the types described by Winston,
Chaffin, and Herrmann [12].

component/integral object Residents might have been exposed to benzene in their

drinking water.

member/collection Benzene belongs in the group of BTX-aromatics.
portion/mass 3 tons of the benzene emissions can be attributed to the dehydrator.
stuff/object Aftershave used to contain benzene.
feature/activity Benzene is used in the dehydration process. The part in this case is
not benzene itself, but the application of benzene, which is abstracted over with the
word used.

place/area Benzene was found in the river. The part in this case is the location where

the benzene was found, which is left anonymous.

The automation of the knowledge discovery task described above is a success if and

only if the following criteria are met:

1. The key concepts of each important pathway through with a carcinogen can reach

humans should be found. (i.e., Recall should be very high.)

2. The researchers should not be distracted by too many red herrings. (i.e., Precision

should be sufficient.)

?
Precision can be evaluated in a straightforward manner by counting how many of the returned part-whole relations are valid. The evaluation of Recall however poses a greater
problem. We are attempting to learn unknown facts. How can one measure which percentage of the unknown facts has been learnt when the facts are unknown? For this
use case we will solve this problem by looking at exposure crises for four substances
(acrylamide, asbestos, benzene, and dioxins) that have been documented in the past. We
know now which pathways led to the exposure in the past. This means we can construct
sets of pathways we should have known at the time of these crises and use these sets to
evaluate Recall.

3 Experimental Set-Up

In this paper we will use two-step method to learn part-whole relations. First we learn
lexical patterns from known part-whole pairs, using search engine queries. Then we
apply these patterns to a set of parts to find wholes that are related to these parts, also
using search engine queries. To constrain the size of the search space we will constrain
both the set of parts and the set of wholes to controlled vocabularies. In more detail, the
method works as follows:
1. Learning part-whole patterns.

(a) Construct a search query for each part-whole pair in a training set.
(b) Collect phrases from the search results that contain the part-whole pair.
(c) Abstract over the parts and wholes in the phrases to get patterns.
(d) Sort the patterns by frequency of occurrence. Discard the bottom of the list.

2. Learning wholes by applying the patterns.

(a) Fill in each pattern with all parts from a set of part instances, while keeping the wholes

free.

(b) Construct search queries for each filled in pattern.
(c) Collect phrases from the search result that contain the filled in pattern.
(d) Extract the part-whole pairs from the phrases.
(e) Constrain the pairs to those with wholes from a controlled vocabulary.
(f) Sort the pairs by frequency of occurrence. Discard the bottom of the list.

In the following two sections we will describe the details of the data sets we used and
we will motivate the decisions we made.

4 Learning Part-Whole Patterns

In this section we will describe the details of step 1 in our part-whole learning method,
described in the previous section. We will describe the training set we used and the
details of the application of step 1 on this training set, and analyze the resulting patterns.
Our training set consists of 503 part-whole pairs, derived from a list of various kinds of
food additives and food product types they can occur in created by the International Food
Information Council4 (IFIC) and the FDA.5 The list contains 58 additives (parts) and 113
food products (wholes), grouped together in 18 classes of additives such as sweeteners
and preservatives. An example is shown in Fig. 1. It is not specified which additives occur

5 http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/ dms/foodic.html

in which food products. To discover this, we took the cartesian product of the additives
and the food products and filtered out the pairs that yielded no hits on Google6 when
put together in a wildcard query. For example, the pair table-top sugar, aspartame is
filtered out, because the query "table-top sugar * aspartame" or "aspartame *
table-top sugar" yields no hits.

For all 503 part-whole pairs that did yield results we collected the first 1000 snippets
(or as many snippets as were available). We attempted to part-of-speech tag these snip-
pets. This did not produce good results, because nearly all snippets were incomplete
sentences and many were lists of substances. For example, . . . Water)*, Xanthan Gum,
Brassica Campestris (Rapeseed), Essential Oils [+/- CI 77491,CI . . . . None of the part-
of-speech taggers we tried were able to deal with this. Therefore we used the untagged
snippets and looked up all consistent phrases that connected the part and whole from
the query. In these phrases we substituted all parts and wholes by the variables part
and whole. This yielded 4502 unique patterns, which we sorted by frequency of occur-
rence. The frequencies of the patterns are shown in Fig. 2.

Due to the fact that there were many lists of substances in our data there were
also many patterns that did not describe a part-whole relation, but that were merely
part of a list of substances containing the part and the whole. These patterns can be
easily recognized, because they contain names of substances. For example, for the
pair cheese, enzymes the following snippet was returned: cheese (pasteurized milk,
cheese cultures, salt, enzymes). An example of a good snippet is: All cheese contains
enzymes.. To exclude lists we removed all patterns that contain, apart from the part and
whole, labels of concepts in agricultural thesauri. The thesauri we used are the NAL
Agricultural Thesaurus7 and the AGROVOC Thesaurus8. (We used the SKOS9 version
of these thesauri.) This filtered out 1491 patterns, of which only 12 were correct partwhole patterns. Fig. 2 shows a Precision graph of the list of patterns before and after
the filtering step.

To restrict the number of Google queries needed to find wholes for parts we decided
not to use all of the remaining 3011 patterns, but to select the most productive patterns.
We analyzed the 300 patterns that produce the most results. For each pattern we looked

NALT concepts.

at the snippets it returned. If the majority of the occurrences of the pattern described a
proper part-whole relation (i.e., Precision  .5) we classified the pattern as part-whole.
Otherwise we classified it as not part-whole.

We distinguished the following groups of patterns, based on the most common types
of errors that led to the classification of the pattern as not part-whole. A pattern can
yield more than one type of false relations, but the classification is based on the most
common of the error types.

too specific Too training-set specific to be useful. Either the pattern contains adjectives

or it yields no hits due to over-training.

too generic The pattern matches part-whole relations, but also too many non-part-whole
relations to be useful. For example, the pattern whole part, as in barn door, can
match any type of collocation.

is a The pattern primarily matches hyponyms. The language used to describe mem-

ber/collection relations is also used for hyponyms.

conjunction/disjunction The pattern primarily matches conjunctions / disjunctions.
related The pattern connects terms that are related, but not part-whole related.
wrong Not a proper pattern for any other reason. Most of the errors in the wrong category can be attributed to the lack of sophisticated linguistic analysis of the phrases.

Table 2 shows the build-up of the different error types.

We corrected 6 patterns that were classified as not part-whole, and added them to
the part-whole patterns. These patterns are not counted in Table 2. They are listed in
Table 1. Notice that in the English grammar, hyphenation turns a part-whole relation
into its inverse. For example, sugar-containing cake and cake containing sugar.

While analyzing the correct part-whole patterns we noticed that the phrases that deal
with part-whole relations do not always explicitly state that relation. Often, the partwhole relation has to be inferred from the description of a process that led to the inclusion of the part in the whole or the extraction of the part from the whole. For example,
from the sentence I add honey to my tea. we can infer that honey is part of the tea,
even though the sentence only mentions the process of adding it. In addition to explicit

descriptions of part-whole relations we distinguish two types of phrases that mention
part-whole relations implicitly.

part of The phrase explicitly describes a part-whole relation. For example, Theres

alcohol in beer..

source of The phrase implicitly describes a part-whole relation by describing the action
of acquiring the part from the whole. For example, Go get some water from the
well..

made with The phrase implicitly describes a part-whole relation by describing a (con-
struction) process that leads to a part-whole relation. For example, I add honey to
my tea.

Table 2 shows that together, the implicit patterns account for a third of the total number
of part-whole pairs.

When applying patterns to learn part-whole relations it is useful to make this distinction into three types, because it turns out that these three types have rather different
Precision and Recall properties, listed in Table 3. The patterns in the part of class yield
the most results with high Precision. The patterns in the made with class also yield many
results, butsomewhat surprisinglywith much lower Precision, while the patterns in
the source of class yield few results, but with high Precision.

The 91 patterns we used for the discovery for wholes are the 83 classified as partwhole in Table 2 and the 8 listed in Table 1 on the right side. They are listed in Table 6.

5 Finding Wholes

In this section we will describe the details of step 2 in our part-whole learning method,
described in the previous section. We will describe the sets of part and whole instances
we used, and analyze the resulting part-whole relations.

In the use case we focus on finding wholes that contain a specific substance. Ini-
tially, any concept name is a valid candidate for a whole. We tackle this problem by
first reducing the set of valid wholes to those that occur in a phrase that matches one
of the patterns learnt in step 1 of our method. This corresponds to step 2c and 2d of
our method. Then we prune this set of potential wholes using two large, agricultural,
and environmental thesauri that are geared to indexing documents relevant to our use
case. We remove all wholes that do not match a concept label in either thesaurus. This

corresponds to step 2e of our method. The former reduction step asserts that there is a
part-whole relation. The latter that the whole is on topic.

We select the possible part instances from a list of carcinogens provided by the International Agency for Research on Cancer10 (IARC). In the IARC Monographs on
the Evaluation of Carcinogenic Risks to Humans11 carcinogenic agents, mixtures and
exposures are classified into four groups: positively carcinogenic to humans, probably
or possibly carcinogenic to humans, not classifiable as carcinogenic to humans, and
probably not carcinogenic to humans. We took the agents and mixtures from the group
of positively carcinogenic factors. We interpreted each line in the list as a description
of a concept. We removed the references and expanded the conjunctions, interpreting
each conjunct as a label of the concept. i.e., For example, we transform the list entry
Arsenic [7440-38-2] and arsenic compounds (Vol. 23, Suppl. 7;1987) into a concept
arsenic with the labels Arsenic and arsenic compounds. The resulting list contains
73 concepts, with 109 labels in total. We applied the 91 patterns that resulted from the
process described Sec. 4 on these 109 labels to discover wholes. We allow for words
generally articles and adjectivesto appear in between the whole and the rest of the
pattern. For example, the pattern part in whole can be interpreted as part in  whole,
and hence will match part in deep-sea whole and part in the whole. This also means
there can be overlap between the sets of part-whole pairs retrieved by patterns. From
the resulting filled-in patterns we extracted the wholes. We filtered out all wholes from
this list that do not appear in the UN FAO AGROVOC Thesaurus and the USDA NAL
Agricultural Thesaurus. When put together, these thesauri contain 69,746 concepts with
87,357 labels in total. Thus limiting the set of discoverable wholes to 69,746 concepts.
For each remaining whole in the list we construct a part-whole relation.

An assessment of the part-whole results is shown in Table 6. We approximated Precision for the 91 patterns we used to find wholes based on a random sample of 25
discovered pairs. The results are shown under Precision. The number of hits per pattern are listed under D. This number includes duplicate phrases and multiple phrases

6 Analysis

In Sec. 2 we stated two criteria that have to be met for the application of our part-whole
learning method to be a success. Precision has to be sufficient, and Recall has to be very
high. In Secs. 4 and 5 we analyzed the results in terms of frequency and Precision. We
achieved an average Precision of .74. In this section we will assess Recall.

Since even the knowledge of experts of whether or not a substance is contained in
some whole is far from complete we can not create a complete gold standard to measure
Recall. It is simply infeasible. We can, however, approximate Recall by computing it
on samples.

We set up four test cases centered towards discovering possible causes of exposure to
a specific carcinogenic agent. The agents we chose are acrylamide, asbestos, benzene,
and dioxins. These substances have all caused health safety crises in the past and possible exposure to them has been extensively documented. For each case we decided on
15 important concepts that contain the carcinogen and define a possible exposure route.
For example, you can be exposed to acrylamide by eating fried food such as french fries,
because acrylamide can be formed in the frying process. The selection of the wholes
was based on reports from the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
and the Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research (TNO) Quality of
Life. The cases were set up without knowledge of the data set and the learning system,
to minimize the hindsight bias, but with knowledge of the concepts in the AGROVOC
and NALT thesauri. The sets of wholes are shown in Table 5, along with the rank at
which the whole occurs in the list of discovered wholes. Recall and the total number of
discovered wholes are shown in Table 4.

For all of the cases we found a large majority of the important concepts. For half of
the missed concepts we found concepts that are very closely related. For example, we

7 Related Work

The method of automatic learning of relations by first learning patterns and then applying these patterns on a large corpus is widely used. An example in the domain of
business mergers and production is described in the 1999 article by Finkelstein-Landau
and Morin [5]. Their work on extracting companies-product relations touches lightly
upon the subject of this paper. Another example of pattern-based relation learning on
the web is the KnowItAll system of Etzioni et al. [4]. The learning of part-whole relations however is quite rare. Two examples, are the work of Berland and Charniak in
1999 [2] and Girju, Badulescu and Moldovan in 2003 [6].

Berland and Charniak learn part-whole patterns from a part-of-speech tagged cor-
pus, the Linguistic Data Consortiums (LDC) North American News Corpus (NANC).
To illustrate the pattern learning phase they mention five example patterns. wholes
part, part of {the|a} whole, part in {the|a} whole, parts of wholes, and parts
in wholes. The domain they used for evaluation is component/integral object relations
between artifacts such as cars and windshields. Even though our domain is quite differ-
ent, we found all five of their example patterns using our training data, respectively at
rank 294, 290, 12, 128, and 2 (of 4502 learnt patterns).

Girju, Badulescu, and Moldovan, used the SemCor 1.7 corpus and the LA Times
corpus from the Ninth Text Retrieval Conference (TREC-9). They used the meronyms
from WordNet [9], mainly component/integral object and member/collection relations.
Girju, Badulescu, and Moldovan also make the distinction between explicit and implicit part-whole constructions, but the implicit constructions they focus on are mainly
possessive forms like the girls mouth, eyes of the baby, oxygen-rich water, and
high heel shoes. They list the three most frequent patterns, which also contain part-
of-speech tags. part of whole, wholes part, and part Verb whole. We found the
first two patterns, as mentioned above, and many instances of the third pattern, such as
part fortified whole at rank 4.

Other applications of part-whole relations than discovering sources of substances are

query expansion for image retrieval [8, Ch. 6], and geographical retrieval [3].

8 Discussion

Our experimental setup assumes that all interesting information pertaining to some carcinogenic substance can be obtained in one single retrieval step. The construction of
complex paths from the substance to the eventual exposure has to happen in the mind of
the userand depends solely on his expertise and ingenuity. This is a severe limitation
that leaves room for considerable improvement. A relatively straightforward extension
would be to iterate the retrieval step using suitable wholes found in retrieval step n 1
in the part slot in retrieval step n. Separation of roles, classes, etc. amongst the wholes

by means of classification (cf., e.g., [7]) might be necessary to limit the inevitable loss
of precision. For example, if step n 1 yielded that there is benzene in some fish, then
proceeding to investigate in step n whether these fish are part of peoples diet. If, how-
ever, step n 1 yielded that benzene is part of a group of carbon-based chemicals, then
proceeding to investigate these chemicals might lead to excessive topic drift.

The usefulness of such an extension depends to a large extent on the validity of
some sort of transitive reasoning over the paths. Yet, the transitivity characteristics of
part-whole expressions are notoriously quirky. Existing accounts actually either take the
classical route set out by Stanislaw Lesniewski in the 1920s, defining the relations in
question axiomatically and with little consideration for actual usage, or they formulate
reasoning patterns for specific application domains and expressions (cf., e.g., [10]). Neither approach is applicable to the mixed bags of interesting token relations our setup
derives from natural language usage. A rare attempt to ground reasoning patterns in the
general usage of part-whole expressions is contained in [12]. Even though our lay-out
is orthogonal (and not even coextensive) to their influential classification of part-whole
relations, their basic intuition w.r.t. transitivity does carry over to our case. In short:

1. The part-whole relations, P, expressed in natural language form a partial order P =

P,;

transitivity;

2. The weakest link determines the interpretation of a chain of part-whole pairs w.r.t.
3. Transitivity fails if the chain contains uncomparable relation instances (w.r.t. ).
Contrary to [12] we assume that there is some weakest mereological relation, i.e., the
poset P has a minimum element. (2) can then be generalized as follows:

2 Any element of P which is compatible with (i.e., as least as weak as) every relation
used to form a chain of part-whole pairs determines a transitive interpretation of that
chain.

This means that for every chain of part-whole pairs there is a meaningful, albeit sometimes rather weak, transitive interpretation available. It depends solely on the intended
utilization whether the information obtained in this way is specific enough to be useful.
What has its merits in a task with a strong element of exploration and novelty detection
like our use case, may well be a show stopper for tasks such as diagnosis in a process
control environment. Refinements, especially concerning the classification of relation
types and the properties of the poset of relations are necessary to extend the general
applicability of this approach.

This is especially true when our work is placed in the more general context of vocabulary and ontology alignment. Most ontology-alignment systems aim at finding equivalence relations. Yet, many real-world alignment cases have to deal with vocabularies
that have a different level of aggregation. (cf., [11]) In such cases equivalent concepts
are quite rare, while aggregation relations, such as broader/narrower term, subclass
and part-whole, are common. The carcinogen-source discovery case can be seen as an
ontology-alignment problem where the alignment relation is the part-whole relation and
the vocabularies are the controlled vocabulary of IARC group 1 carcinogens, and the
AGROVOC and NALT thesauri. Under this perspective our work describes a first step

towards a novel approach to ontology alignment. The influence part-whole alignment
relations have on the consistency of the resulting aligned ontologies is unknown.
