Abstract. In this paper we present the linked data sets produced by the eagle-i project. We describe the content, the features 
and some of the applications currently leveraging these datasets. 

Keywords: eagle-i, linked data, biomedical ontologies, research resources, research profiles 

1.  Introduction 

Biomedical research relies on the ability to access 
the  right  tools  and  research  resources  needed  to  answer  specific  biological  questions.  Biomedical  resources are generated, purchased and used during the 
course of research. Information about such resources 
is often sequestered in lab notebooks or in lab digital 
records, making the resources difficult to find, share, 
and  reuse.  The  goal  of  eagle-i,    (http://www.eagle-
i.net) - a project initially funded by the National Center  for  Research  Resources  (NCRR)  and  now  in  its 
fourth  year-  is  to  make  these  invisible  research 
resources  more  discoverable  by  collecting  information about them and making the information available through a semantic federated search application 
and as linked data sets.  

To support structured data collection, retrieval and 
publication, we developed a distributed software plat-
(https://open.med.harvard.edu/display/eaglei/) 
form 
and  a  modular  set  of  ontologies  collectively  known 
as 
the  eagle-i  Resource  Ontology  (ERO)  and 
available at https://code.google.com/p/eagle-i/. 

The  ontology  contains  domain  representation  for 
research resources including organisms, instruments, 
protocols,  constructs,  antibodies,  biospecimens,  human  studies  and  research  opportunities.  The  eagle-i 
system  architecture  comprises  four  main  compo-

nents: the underlying ontology; data collection tools 
including an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) toolkit 
and  a  web-based,  ontology-driven  Semantic  Web 
Entry and Editing Tool (SWEET, see Figure 4); institutional  triple-store  repositories;  and  a  central  webbased search application (see Figure 3).  

 The ETL toolkit allows generation of Excel templates driven by the ERO ontology for automatic data 
ingest.  Data  sources  used  in  the  project  range  from 
csv  files,  database  dumps  and  Resource  Description 
Framework  (RDF)  triples  that  can  be  automatically 
ingested  through  ETL  procedures,  to  data  entered 
manually  through  the  SWEET.    The  data  generated 
through  eagle-is  data  collection  tools  are  stored  as 
RDF  triples  in  Sesame  2.6,  and  made  available 
through SPARQL endpoints and as linked data sets. 
The  datasets  provide  interlinks  to  several  other  datasets 

DBpedia 
(http://datahub.io/dataset/vivo).  

In this paper we present the key characteristics of 
the  datasets,  provide  sample  SPARQL  queries  and 
discuss some of the known usages of our datasets.

2. Dataset Descriptions 

Our datasets describe biomedical resources available at 25 institutions. We also  maintain a dataset of 
resources  shared  across  eagle-i  institutions  (e.g.  or-

ganizations, generic organisms) referred to as global 
eagle-i instances. The main resource types we cover 
are: Biological Specimen, Database, Document, Human  Study,  Instrument,  Organism  or  Virus,  Organi-
zation,  Person,  Reagent,  Research  Opportunity,  Ser-
vice, Software.

we present a summary of the triples in each dataset; 
these numbers include only the triples that are directly  related  to  resource  instances,  that  is  (a)  triples 
where  the  subject  is  a  resource  instance  and  (b)  triples that provide minimal information (type and label

es while remaining of general use to the biomedical community at-large. 

Regarding the first point, because most of our domain coverage was biomedical in nature, we referred 
to principles and existing ontologies within the OBO 
Foundry  [1].  Conformance  with  OBO  Foundry 
standards fixed the following design choices: 

 Use of the Basic Formal Ontology [2] as the up-

per level ontology 

 Predominant  utilization  of  ontologies  in  the 
OBO Foundry constellation due to their quality, 
extensive usage and common design principles 

 Application  of  the  MIREOT  principle  [3]  for 

referencing entities in external ontologies 

as 

the 

As far as the second goal is concerned, we developed  a  design  pattern  approach  to  separate,  within 
our  ontology  suite,  the  application-specific  portion 
from the core content that was worth sharing with 
the community. Our approach, described extensively 
in  [4],  has  been  generalized  and  reused  in  other  efsuch 
forts 
Ontology 
https://code.google.com/p/reagent-ontology/) 
(ReO 
and 
the  Agent,  Resource  and  Grant  ontology 
(ARG https://code.google.com/p/connect-isf/).  It has 
also led to a set of recommendations for implementing a maintenance and release pipeline using available tools and services [5]. 

Reagent 

Another key element of our ontology development 
process  has  been  the  coordination  of  efforts  within 
the Biomedical Ontology Community.  These include 
active collaboration and discussion with other ontology  development  groups  (through  tracker  term  re-
quests,  developer  call  participation,  etc.).    Although 
time consuming, these efforts allow reuse of portions 
of other ontologies and help achieve better data integration and interoperability.

endocrine system. 

3. Domain modeling 

Our approach to domain  modeling  was driven by 

the following goals: 

1.  Reuse existing ontologies as much as possible  to  reduce  the  modeling  burden  and  to 
maximize future data integration 

2.  Identify  design  patterns  and  ontology  engineering solutions that would allow a set of 

about transgenic organism. All of the properties for this class are shown. Clicking the property name displays its definition, URI and annotations as shown by feature (B). Referenced taxonomies are sets of terms used as ranges for some properties (such as the Disease taxonomy for 
the related disease property) while embedded types denote classes for which instances can be only created in the context of another instance. 

For example, a construct insert can only be created in conjunction with its containing construct.

ontology 

We  present  sample  queries  that  illustrate  interesting  usages  of  the  eagle-i  datasets.  For  each  one,  we 
specify  the  particular  SPARQL  endpoint  used  such 
that query results can be reproduced. In order to better  understand  the  classes  and  relationships  used  in 
the following queries we suggest referring to the ea-
(http://search.eagle-
gle-i 
i.net/model/),  a  screen  capture  from  which  can  be 
seen in Figure 2.  
URIs of eagle-i classes and properties can also be 
found using Ontobee [6] 
(See http://www.ontobee.org/browser/index.php?o=E
RO). The queries can be executed through a 
SPARQL interface or passed programmatically to the 
endpoint.

In the following examples, we omit for brevity the 

declaration of the following prefixes:

4.1. Query for researcher expertise 

in 

radioimmunoassay 

The eagle-i datasets allow identification of individual 
expertise  by  leveraging  the  connection  between  resources  and  related  techniques,  diseases  and  instruments  as  well  as  the  linkage  between  resources  and 
people.  As  an  example,  the  query  below  identifies 
likely  experts 
techniques 
(obo:ERO_0000652)  by  connecting  the  nodes  between  the  technique  and  individuals.  In  this  case, 
collecting  all  resources  that  reference  the  technique 
(obo:ERO_0000543)  and  returning  the  person(s)  indicated  as  contact  (obo:ERO_000021)  for  that  re-
source.  

SELECT DISTINCT? person WHERE 

## Select Resources that have related  
## technique radioimmunoassay 
?resource obo:ERO_0000543 obo:ERO_0000652. 

## Select the contact person for  
## the resource  

?resource obo:ERO_0000021 ?person. 

If the query  is executed against the OHSU endpoint 
(http://ohsu.eagle-i.net/sparqler/query/)  it  will  return 

a  contact  for  a  set  of  services  that  involve  radioimmunoassay such as the one represented in Figure 1.  

4.2. Query for animal models relevant for a 
particular disease 

Another interesting query is related to the identification  of  animal  models  used  in  the  research  of  autoimmune diseases. The query is reported below.  

SELECT ?resource WHERE 

## Select Organism Resources 
?resource a obo:OBI_0100026. 
## That are model of some disease 
?resource obo:ERO_0000233 ?disease. 
## And the disease is an autoimmune  
## disease 
?disease rdfs:subClassOf mesh:D001327. 

(http://harvard.eagle-i.net/sparqler/query) 

It  is  interesting  to  note  that  the  results  returned  for 
this  query,  when  executed  against  the  Harvard  end-
in-
point 
clude  animal  models  related  to  Diabetes  Mellitus, 
Type  1  (see  for  example:  http://harvard.eagle-
i.net/i/0000012a-25bf-7988-f5ed-943080000005) and 
Sjogren's 
(http://harvard.eagle-
i.net/i/0000012a-25bf-7988-f5ed-943080000003) 
because  both  are  subsumed  in  the  MeSH  Hierarchy 
for Autoimmune disease (mesh:D001327).

4.3. Query for resources across datasets  

For several resources in eagle-i (such as animal mod-
els)  we collect information on related genes via Entrez  gene  IDs.  This  is  a  useful  entry  point  for  connecting  non-eagle-i  datasets.  In  the  query  below  for 
instance,  we  probe  data  at  the  University  of  Puerto 
Rico  (UPR)  for  resources  relevant  to  Stony  Brook 
investigators based on the genes they have published 
about.  This  query,  when  executed  against  the  UPR 
re-
endpoint 
turns  4  authors  related  to  a  ErbB2  construct  insert 
(http://upr.eagle-

5. Dataset Usage 

A  number  of  groups  have  begun  to  make  use  of 
eagle-i-produced  data  by  implementing  search  and 
visualization tools that reuse the RDF and that complement the functionality provided by eagle-i applica-
tions.  The  Harvard  Catalyst  Core  Facilities  Portal 
(http://cbmi.catalyst.harvard.edu/cores/index.html) 
was an early adopter on this  front. This portal component  generates  HTML  pages  from  the  core  facilities data stored at Harvard Universitys eagle-i repos-
itory.  The automated production of these pages ensure that the service offerings as  well as the contact 
information  for  each  core  are  standardized,  centralized and current, as they are maintained through the 
eagle-i SWEET. Another interesting reuse of eagle-i 

service 
(http://www.ohsu.edu/research/coresearch/)  at  Oregon  Health  &  Science  University.  Leveraging  the 
Plumage  tool  (http://ctsiatucsf.github.com/plumage/) 
developed  by  the  Clinical  &  Translational  Science 
Institute at  the University  of  California  San  Francis-
co, CoreSearch allows for visualization and search of

OHSU  core  laboratories,  their  service  offerings  and 
their  instruments  by  converting  the  RDF  data  accessed  through  the  eagle-i  SPARQL  endpoints  to 
static HTML pages that can be optimally indexed by 
Google and other search engines.  eagle-i datasets are 
also  used  in  the  context  of  the  CTSAConnect 
(http://www.ctsaconnect.org/)  project  to  link  clinicians  to  basic  researchers  through  publications  and 
research  resources.  There  are  several  related  initiatives that aim at representing and sharing data about 
biomedical  resources.  For  those  under  the  OBO 
Foundry 
phenoscape 
(http://phenoscape.github.io/),  we  are  actively  working  on  the  reuse  of  URIs,  modeling  approach  and 
technical solutions and we are engaged in discussions 
about

6. Updating maintenance and scalability 

The  creation  of  the  eagle-i  datasets  over  the  four 
years  of  the  project  was  possible  as  a  result  of  the 
dedicated  work  of  resource  navigators  (Ph.D.  level 
scientists  contacting  laboratories  and  collecting  resource  information)  and  curators  responsible  for  the 
data entry and quality control of collected data. Our 
ETL procedures provide a robust mechanism for automating the ingest of large amounts of structured or 
semi-structured  data,  though  they  require  schema 
mapping  and  some  curation  of  the  input  data  to  ensure data quality. After the initial grant period, each 
institution in the network took over the responsibility 
for maintaining and updating their local datasets with 
the  help  of  detailed  guidelines 
tools 
(https://open.med.harvard.edu/display/eaglei/Training
).   

The  eagle-i  software  stack,  which  is  available  as 
open source,  will continue to be maintained and enhanced  by  the  development  team  at  Harvard  with 
contributions  from  the  open  source  community.  The 
Harvard  team  also  operates  central  components  that 
tie the eagle-i network together (a network node reg-
istry,  the  central  search  application,  the  global  instances  repository).  The  eagle-i  ontology  has  been 
and will remain an open source community resource 
that  is  updated  through  tracker  requests.  Each  new 
eagle-i software release incorporates the latest release 
of  the  eagle-i  Resource  Ontology.  To  assure  data 
alignment in accordance with these regular ontology 
changes,  the  developers  concurrently  release  data 
migration scripts to update each of the datasets. Other 

and 

great help for our end users. 

  Another  problem  we  had  to  face  while  creating 
the  dataset  was  related  to  particular  instances  that 
did not belong to any institution but were supposed to 
be  global (i.e. used from each institution). Examples of this kind of instances are Organizations, Manufactures or any kind of resource that are not tied to 
particular institutions in our network. For these kinds 
of resources we use a particular name space and we 
store 
in  a  dedicated  global 
repository 
(http://global.eagle-i.net/sparqler/sparql).
