This final issue 6 of the year 2015 contains 3
regular submissions, which brings the total number of published papers (not counting editorials)
in 2015 to 35. At the same time, this marks the
second year in which we have published six issues,
rather than four. Given the still increasing number
of high-quality submissions, and to ensure timely
publication, we will continue with six issues for
2016.

The first paper in this issue, Semantic Technologies for Historical Research: A Survey, by Albert Mero no-Pe nuela, Ashkan Ashkpour, Marieke
van Erp, Kees Mandemakers, Leen Breure, Andrea Scharnhorst, Stefan Schlobach, and Frank
van Harmelen is a survey article. It revisits joint

work by historians and computer scientists on the
use of Semantic Web technologies in the context of
historical research and the handling of information
relevant for said research.

The second paper, A logical characterisation of
SPARQL federation, by Audun Stolpe is a regular research paper. It presents the authors work
towards a formal framework for reasoning about
distributed query processing in SPARQL.

Finally, the third paper, Link Traversal Querying for a diverse Web of Data, by Juergen Um-
brich, Aidan Hogan, Axel Polleres, and Stefan
Decker is a regular research paper as well. It studies the recall and effectiveness of link-traversal
based query execution over the web of data.
