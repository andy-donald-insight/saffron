Abstract. This paper presents an ontological approach to the domain of drama. After a description of the drama
domain in a cross-cultural and media setting, we introduce the ontology Drammar. Drammar consists of two
components, encoding respectively the conceptual model and the SWRL rules. The conceptual model, mainly
grounding in AI theories, represents the major concepts of drama, such as agents, actions, plans, units, emotions
and values. Then, the paper focuses on the rule component that augments the representation by mapping the
intentions of the characters onto the actions actually performed and by appraising the emotion felt by the characters
in the drama. To illustrate the functioning of the ontology we introduce a running example from an excerpt of
the drama Hamlet. Finally, we carry out an evaluation of the approach on an annotation task that is relevant for
drama studies research and teaching. In particular, the emotion appraisal is tested on the main characters of four
dramas of different nature, by computing precision and recall results with respect to a human annotator.

Keywords: drama ontology, SWRL rules, semantic annotation

1. Introduction

The exponential spread of drama (and dramatic
stories) in contemporary culture has led Esslin [35]
to forge the definition of dramatic media, i.e.
media that display characters performing live ac-
tions, such as theatre, cinema and videogames.
The notion of drama, traditionally acknowledged
by studies in all disciplinary fields, ranging from
literary criticism [46] and semiotics [84], to aesthetics [15] and psychology [12], has been boosted,
over the last decade, by the advent of digitaliza-

tion and new media, with dramatic media objects
shared by the users of social networks. Drama
permeates fan-fiction, amateur and traditional audiovisual production, docu-fiction, digitalized con-
tents, etc., thus setting the need for indexing and
search tools especially geared to dramatic con-
tents. In addition, new forms of drama have leveraged a number of AI techniques, with the devise
of machine readable representations of drama and
the automation of a number of dramatic functions
[70,82,100,88]. Finally, the quest for the massive
access to digital (dramatic) media has spawned the

V. Lombardo et al. / Coupling conceptual modeling and rules for the annotation of dramatic media

issue of the metadata annotation, which is necessary for the indexing, retrieval, and presentation
of media items, with the appearance of models and
applications in both the research and production
communities [34,64,61].

Such scenarios advocate a carefully designed
and theoretically sound model of drama, valid
across different genres and media types. This paper addresses the application of ontological representation and reasoning to formalize the dramatic
qualities of media objects. We describe a formal
ontology of the drama domain, called Drammar,
and its integration with a rule components (based
on DL-safe SRWL rules), that augments the representation encoded in the ontology with further information obtained through automatic reasoning.
In this paper, we describe this approach by resorting to the conceptual framework of drama anno-
tation: after a semiautomatic annotation of some
dramatic qualities (through a webbased platform
for the annotation of dramatic media [64]), the rule
component augments the obtained representation
by inferring further dramatic qualities through
reasoning.

In particular, the rule component addresses
two specific tasks related with the description of
drama,
i.e., the mapping of the plot incidents
onto the characters intentions, and the assignment of emotional states to the characters. Both
tasks, relevant for drama indexing, manipulation
and presentation, rely on the drama model encoded in the ontology. These tasks were selected
with the research goal of assessing the use of the
ontology as the pivot of a modular framework
where different rule sets are employed on annotated dramatic works to augment their representa-
tion. These tasks correspond to two cognitive pro-
cesses, intention recognition and emotion appraisal
respectively, that are intrinsic to drama fruition
and criticism, and can be easily operationalized
through rules. The rule component yields a new
set of relations over the elements of the conceptual model of drama (consisting of agents, actions,
plans, units, etc., see Section 2) that are added to
the representation, alleviating the annotation process and providing an explicit and verifiable encoding of the cognitive processes.

As a running example, we employ a paradigmatic and well known drama scene, the so called
nunnery scene of Shakespeares Hamlet, throughout the paper to show how the framework com-

ponents are integrated to provide a rich representation of drama features. Moreover, we apply the
rule approach to a small corpus of dramatic works,
with the goal of assessing its feasibility and comparing its results with the fully manual annotation
performed by experts.

The structure of the paper is the following: Sections 2 and 3 survey the major facts about the
domain of drama and the related work in drama
formalization, respectively. Section 4 describes the
ontology, with a thorough account of how its commitments are rooted in the literature on drama described in Section 2. Section 5 describes the rule
component, with Sections 5.1 and 5.2 devoted,
respectively, to its two modules. The evaluation
(Section 6) and Conclusions conclude the paper.

2. The Domain of Drama

Drama has been largely discussed as cultural object in its historical and stylistic development [14].
Here we discuss drama from the technical point
of view; in other words, we pay attention to the
craftsmanship behind the standard production of
drama rather than the excellence of a specific au-
thor. Referring to drama as a standard, means we
do not address the body of works of a specific au-
thor, or a definite set of manuscripts. We address
that abstract construct that western culture recognizes as drama behind various manifestations.
Because in order to describe any object one must
first define the dimensions and features that define that object, in this section we describe the elements we take in account to measure the quantity of drama, or in other words, how much drama
there is in a story.

Standard drama can be summarized as a group
of specific features, that can be defined more or
less precisely. These features refer to the identifiable elements in Shakespeares Romeo and Juliet
as well as in Tom Stoppards Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern Are Dead, in HBOs Sopranos and
even in some reality show, such as CBSs Sur-
vivors, and, finally,
in some famous videogame
such as Rockstar Games L.A. Noir or Ubisofts
Assassin Creeds series.

Within this wide range, the fruition of drama
mostly focuses on enjoying the story rather than
appreciating the aesthetic features or literary values (such as style, verse, poetry, wittiness, etc.),

although the latter are appraised by professionals
and knowledgeable amateurs/enthusiasts. The notion of story is widely acknowledged as the construction of an incident sequence [9], that, abstracting from the media specific properties, is motivated by the causeeffect chain [89]. Indeed almost all the repositories of theatre and movies hold
a synopsis of the story for each of the listed items
(see, e.g., the Internet Movie Data Base1). But it
is well known that in dramatic media (drama) the
audience engages the story via the characters behavior [49] rather than via the literary values; indeed the causeeffect chain results from a complex
interplay of agents, objects and events, well known
in playwriting techniques [30].

To distill what we have briefly named the standard drama we do not face the immense task of
analyzing one by one the numbers of plays dispersed along centuries. We can count on a vast literature on drama techniques in which it is possible to find ready made semi-formal descriptions.
In this literature we find a consumptive characterization about the form of drama. Drama scholars
have developed a number of approaches to dramatic texts and theatrical plays [14]. The technical point of view relies on the socalled constructivist approach, which departs from the linguistic
and literary forms to focus on the constitutive elements of drama. So, to explore the common story
based features that reconcile Romeo and Juliet
and Assassin Creeds, we focus on: how the plot develops and is structurally organized, how characters are involved in the actions, what conflicts take
place. Within the literature we select the ones that
apply to the modern western drama and we note
that some shared forms exist (even if described in
different terms). From those forms, we select the
ones that mostly comply with the cultural object
we define as standard drama. For example, if we
see that all the literature stress the partition of
drama into scenes, we derive that the partition is
an element to be described in our ontology (e.g.
we have named this element Unit in our terminol-
ogy); or, all the literature says that the character
is pivotal in drama, therefore our ontology must
account for the notion of character (Agent in our
terminology).

Within this framework, in particular, the analyses of Lavandier [60], Ryngaert [91], Hatcher [52],
and Spencer [96] contribute by distilling the dramatic elements that the author has to handle in
order to produce a well formed play.

2.1. Elements of drama

The Greek origin of the word drama is related to
the notion of do, act, performing. Nowadays drama
can be seen as a sequence of structured actions
described in a text or in a score. Szondi has defined the drama as the action at the present time
acted directly by characters [99, pp. 194-196]. Nev-
ertheless, this does not mean that the drama is
uniquely the event enacted in front of the audi-
ence. As stated by Aristotle, a text, to be dra-
matic, does not need to be performed [3, 1453b
1-10] [2, p. xxxviii]. Therefore, we can say that
drama is dramatic not because it is presented in
front of an audience, but because of its specific
tools of mimesis, hence because of its specific language of actions. Scholars have clearly stated that
drama is made of characters behaviors [11], and
that a dramatic action is not doing something
but what a character wants [96, p. 38]. The
action has to spread out of the characters inner
motivation and provide clues about her/his personality and intentions; most importantly, it must
produce the higher level of conflicts and the consequent emotional appraisal. Action, intention, conflict are key terms in a dynamic perspective because they link the drama to the design of behav-
iors. For each element, we refer to works in drama
critics that (compared to others) mostly focus on
the element described.

In this section, and all along the article, we use a
running example taken for Shakespeares Hamlet:
the so called nunnery scene. In this scene, situated in the Third Act, Ophelia is sent to Hamlet
by Polonius (her father) and Claudius (Hamlets
uncle, the king) to confirm the assumption that
Hamlets madness is caused by his rejected love.
According to the two conspirators, Ophelia should
induce him to talk about his inner feelings. At the
same time, Hamlet tries to convince Ophelia that
the court is corrupted and that she should go to a
nunnery. In the middle of the scene Hamlet puts
Ophelia to a test to verify her honesty: guessing
(correctly) that the two conspirators are hidden
behind the curtain, he asks the girl to reveal where

V. Lombardo et al. / Coupling conceptual modeling and rules for the annotation of dramatic media

her father Polonius is. She decides to lie, by replying that he is at home. Hamlet realizes from the
answer that also Ophelia is corrupted and consequently becomes very angry: there is no hope to
redeem the court. The annotation describes the
excerpt in which Hamlet is testing Ophelias honesty by asking rhetorically a question he knows the
answer of, namely the current location of her father Polonius (the same room where they are, behind a curtain), and Ophelia lies by giving a false
location, namely Polonius home.

2.1.1. Action

From Aristotle to Szondi, it is clear that drama
is a specific manner of organizing actions that exhibit some qualities. The Thirty Six Dramatic Situations represents a seminal point because, from a
large repository of plays, it extracts a list of situations that are perceived as dramatic [83]. Each situation is a specific action (e.g. Vengeance). Within
each situation, and its subdivisions, Polti defines:
the type of agents described (e.g. assassin, victim),
the relations among agents (e.g. affinity, love, kin-
ship, etc.);, beliefs and goals that motivate the
action (e.g. the agents planning), the effects on
the world; and the actions emotional charge. For
example, Ophelias action of lying about her fathers location is motivated by her goal of respecting Polonius authority and the belief that Polonius is behind the curtain.

2.1.2. Agent

Action involves at least one agent and must be
the outcome of a deliberative process [2, p. xxiv].
In order to be effective, the agent must have goals,
deliberations and emotional states [93]. Modern
drama has overcome the notion of the character
as a whole nucleus (e.g. the romantic hero), and
has developed the idea of a character consisting of
the sum of its actions [91]. Therefore, the agent is
a willing dynamic entity that constantly appraises
the state of its world by means of rational deliberation and emotional charge. For example, the
nunnery scene is carried out by two agents who
interact according their own beliefs and feelings.

2.1.3. Conflict

Not all the actions carried on by an agent are
dramatic. This quality spreads from a tension or
an opposition between two or more agents and/or
the environment. The notion of conflict is ubiquitous in drama critics.

Leaving aside the opposition between the tragic
hero and the fate in classical Greek plays, we can
easily trace it back to 1758 with the seminal work
of Diderot, who foresees a conflict based on the
opposition between the character and the social
environment [28]. Years later, Lessing also wrote
about an opposition driven by characters different moral values, therefore motivated by the inner feelings [62]. The conflict is at the core of the
drama for Hegels Aesthetics, in which

drama is not a mere representation of an enterprise which peacefully runs its course. It has
interest only from the animated strife between
its personages and their struggle and perils. It
gives us the final result of these conflicts [54,
p. 287].

His whole perspective on drama is based upon the
conflict as a core element that drives the characters creation and the storyline. From here onward,
conflict became unmissable in the literature and
was addressed in more detail. On the one side,
it has been seen as the main engine of the plot
because it provides reasons to characters change
[30]; on the other side, it has been divided into
types (e.g. inner, interpersonal, social [72]). Nevertheless the main contribution on conflict is to
represent the obstacle in a notion of drama as
the struggle of an agent toward her/his desires
[60]. The action in the nunnery scene is dramatic because of the two characters conflicting
goals: Hamlet wants to turn Ophelia away from the
courts influence; Ophelia wants to respect Polonius authority.

2.1.4. Units

The wholeness of drama springs from its parts.
The elements listed above (Action, Agents, Con-
flicts) must be coordinated within a container that
allows them to interact one another. Although it is
usual to describe drama in terms of acts and scene
(or sequence for the movie), from Freytag [43] onward it is clear that the subdivision of plot does
not respond to practical reasons (such as characters entrances or exits) but to dramatic reason. In
other words the actions must be grouped according to theirs goal, conflicts and solutions; and each
group can be further grouped as well, leading to
the macro segmentation in three or five acts [60]
[39]. These grouped actions are narrative blocks, or
scenes, that may be seen as units that compose the

structure (see below). The scenes are the container
of the characters deliberations, of the emotional
charge, and of the consequents conflicts. They are
a motivational abstraction of the units and may
be graded according the quality of obstacles, con-
flicts, and changes that take place in it [81, p. 230
and p. 234]. The units are the containers of the
characters actions. Although the notion of unit
is ubiquitous in drama critics, there is no shared
opinion about the rules that define its boundaries.
Beside the traditional narrative segmentation that
follow the development of the story timeline [96],
there are more complex approaches that link directly the unit to the characters value at stake
[72].

In the nunnery scene, the changing goals of
Hamlet, with the corresponding tension rising and
the emotional charge is contained in one scene.
Here the clash of the divergent plans and goals
generate the characters emotions. Furthermore,
the several actions in the timeline mark the succession of a number of units, and implement Hamlets
appeal to Ophelia to go to a nunnery, testing of
Ophelia honesty, his angriness about Ophelia cor-
ruption, leaving Ophelia to face her own destiny.

2.1.5. Structure

The agents actions in conflict must be organized to give a sense of causality and wholeness,
i.e in a plot. In other words, the single action is
not only dramatic (as described by Poltis situa-
tions), but must be part of a sequence of actions
that are ordered. The order is driven by the raising
tension and is normally described as an arc along
the temporal line. Therefore the sequence must be
constructed according to a well established pace
that goes from the introduction, to rising, climax
and return [43].

In the nunnery scene, Hamlet quietly starts
by trying to convince Ophelia to go to a nunnery
(to escape the corruption of Elsinor court), proceeds by rising his tension to test Ophelia about
her honesty, reaches a tension top after realizing
that even Ophelia is corrupted, and turns his attention away from his love for Ophelia to the revenge of his fathers death.

2.1.6. Emotion

Whatever point of view we adopt to define the
units and their sequencing in the structure, it is
clear that all is driven by conflict and the result has to lead to some emotional charge. There-

fore the units can be described also as emotional
episodes [95, p. 39], in which the agent feels some
emotion as a result of his appraisal of the situa-
tion. Beside their importance in human behavior
[22], emotions are one of the distinctive features of
drama, as acknowledged since the Age of Enlightenment [27] and stated more recently by contemporary aesthetics [95,49]. Emotions represent the
crucial aspect of a dramatic action, because they
are the glue of the elements of drama we have cited
above (actions, conflict, and dramatic arc), that
are all qualified by the emotion represented (e.g.,
the climax shows an action that spills out from -or
causes- a strong and deep emotion, while the introduction can contain more descriptive events). But
the emotions are also crucial because they allow
the audience to fully appraise the action and its
meaning in the plot. Characters are the primary
medium by which a drama is conveyed to the audience and a character charged with the right emotion will secure the emotional bonding with the
audience [48,16].

In the nunnery scene, Hamlet, as a consequence of his and Ophelias actions, feels Distress,
for discovering that his belief that Ophelia is honest is false, and Anger, after Ophelias lie about
her father.

This set of elements are necessary to describe
the drama, though not sufficient to address any
dramatic situation. Nevertheless, the model we
present here is devised so to be extended by including other features addressing, for example, narratological or performative qualities.

3. Related Work

The field of drama is relevant to several research
lines, ranging from cultural heritage dissemination
to the indexing and search of media repositories.
Here we widen our perspective to include story
ontologies, that also address the narrative models that are not strictly dramatic. We are particularly oriented to the applicative paradigms of the
mediation between audience and cultural objects,
aimed at stimulating the access to heritage items,
and the metadata annotation of media reposito-
ries, aimed at the indexing and search of media
items.

V. Lombardo et al. / Coupling conceptual modeling and rules for the annotation of dramatic media

Story ontologies have been proposed with two
main goals, namely the purpose of classifying story
types and the purpose of providing an underlying model for narrative annotation [48,58,18,47].
A well known example of the first type of systems
is the work in [48]. In this work, inspired by the
work of Propp [84], an ontology of fairy tales, encoded in OWL, is exploited to model different plot
types. The system uses the ontology to perform
case-based reasoning: given a story plan, the system searches the ontology for a similar plot, measuring the semantic similarity of the given plot
with the plots encoded in the ontology. A natural
language module, then, generates a textual version of the obtained plot, adapted to the input parameters (characters, situations, etc.) provided by
the user. In the same line, the work in [51] uses
automatic classification techniques to classify plot
types; the Opiate system [36] relies on a Proppian
model of story to create and populate story worlds.
A formalization of Propps model is described by
[47]: in this work, a computational system exploits
the formal model to generate new stories in the
style of Russian fairy tales. Differently from previous attempts based on Propps theory, this proposal constitute a more rigorous description of the
original model in computational terms. In recent
years, the extension of Propps theory as a general story model has been questioned by several
authors, especially in relation with the new media
[19,101,47].

Overcoming the differences across media types
and genres is one of the main challenges faced by
the research on media annotation. In this field,
story ontologies have been proposed as a way to
provide a shared and inter-operable model for annotation scenarios which rely on the paradigm
of crowdsourcing and are characterized by the
presence of different types of narrative contents.
A mediaindependent model is provided by the
OntoMedia ontology, exploited across different
projects (such as the Contextus Project [58,61]), to
annotate the narrative content of different media
objects, ranging from written literature to comics
and TV fiction. The OntoMedia ontology contains
a very detailed model, tailored on story annota-
tion, and mainly focused on the representation of
events and the order in which they are exposed. In
the ontology Stories2, developed in collaboration

2http://www.contextus.net/stories

with the BBC for the application in fields as news,
drama, and historical facts, is employed to annotate plot elements across the episode storylines of
the Dr. Who scifi TV series. OntoMedia lends
itself to the comparison of cross-media versions
of the same story (for example, a novel and its
filmic adaptation); it is an event (instead of char-
acter) based description of the timeline of story
incidents, with no interpretive intents, and so does
not cover the description of characters in terms of
intentions, goals, etc.. Complementary, the Story
Intention Graph [34] relies on the representation
of the shortterm characters intentions to build
an interpretive layer of a narrative text, although
it does not account for the whole causal sequence
of the drama, motivated by longterm intentions.
The SUMO ontology, although not specifically
tailored on story modelling, has been employed
for the task of story annotation and story gen-
eration. In [21], the axiomatic definition of pro-
cesses, in SUMO, is exploited to reason on stories and to generate plots. This approach, although
not directly relevant for story models, reveals the
relevance of an accurate representation of actions
(processes, in SUMO terminology) for story description and annotation.

In the last decade, the use of ontologies (and
story ontologies in particular) in online access to
cultural heritage has been investigated by several
projects. As reviewed by [55] and [29], computational ontologies are especially suitable to encode conceptual models for the access to digital
archives, and to structure the interaction between
the archive and the users.

A pioneering contribution in the use of ontologies for access to cultural heritage is given by
the Culture Sampo project [57]. This project encompasses a set of domain ontologies, which provide the background against which cultural objects (artworks, artists, traditional practices, etc.)
can be explored, tracking the underlying relations
among them [56]. Concerning the story level, how-
ever, the system allows the exploration of the artifacts based on their connections with a reference story (the Kalavala Finnish saga), but the
story representation is only functional to the access to cultural objects and is not intended as a
standalone account of the story domain.

Narrative is the focus of the Bletchley Park Text
system [75], a semantic system designed with the
goal of supporting the users in the exploration of

online museum collections. The system relies on an
ontology of story, taken from the Story Fountain
project [76]. Again, this system is strongly committed to the use of story to create narrative paths
encompassing the museums objects, rather than
representing the story elements in an all-purpose
fashion.

In general, the exponential growth of digitized
media has called the attention on the problem
of providing contextualized information about the
data. Although most research on metadata annotation is not targeted at story or dramatic
elements, some drama-based approaches have
emerged, possibly in conjuction with tools for an-
notation.

The amount of usergenerated metadata concerning dramatic media witnesses the interest of
the general audience (see, e.g., the tags that are
freely inserted by users in public repositories).
However, as reported in [63] for the YouTube clips
extracted from a classic feature film, most of the
tags concern the resource (Title, Actor, Director,
Production, Editing, Publish, Genre) and only a
few (Character, Object, Environment, Action) the
content.

Based on the usergenerated tags, in the specific
domain of the performing arts (which are related
to drama), the tool MyStoryPlayer is a purposely
targeted interface for the semantic annotation of
documents (such as video, audio, text, image, . . . ,
encoded in RDF format) and the navigation of the
annotations creating its own nonlinear experience
or path [7].

Although all the ontologies and systems reviewed here provide a (partial) formal view of the
drama phenomenon, none has developed a consistent and comprehensive metadata system, based
on a shared set of constructs, that can appropriately reflect the vocabulary of dramatic elements.
This paper aims at contributing to bridge this gap.
We recognize that the set of elements we have
identified for the formal representation of drama
are not exhaustive of the variety of drama issues.
However, we are confident that the evidence provided in Section 2 classify such elements as necessary and foundational for more extensive models
of drama.

In the next sections we describe the Drammar
ontology, with its conceptual model and the rule
component.

4. The Ontology Drammar

The domain of drama, surveyed in Section 2,
poses a set of requirements for the formal representation of dramatic qualities, ranging from the
structural aspects of drama organization, necessary to account for the way the matter is structured in specific works, to the characterization of
its main entities, such as characters and plot. Nev-
ertheless, the literature never reaches a sufficient
degree of formality such as to be straightforwardly
expressed in a machine readable representation.
So, in order to translate those requirements into
the ontology, we resorted to a set of theories and
models well established in AI. The ratio of this design strategy is twofold: on the one side, it augments the interoperability of the ontology with
other systems and representations; on the other
side, it allows relying on widespread, sound mod-
els, whose properties have been investigated to
depth in the past. For example, the agent theory
lends itself well to represent the notion of charac-
ter: because the character is described as a deliberative and emotional agent in all the literature, we
relied on a consolidated agent model to represent
it, the BDI model [86], augmented with cognitive
processes for emotion generation [78].

Finally, in order to ground the design on a definite task, the ontology was developed with the
task of manual annotation of dramatic objects in
mind. Annotation was selected as being fairly neutral with respect to the representational choices:
tasks such as story generation or automatic detection of story units would have required the inclusion of specific heuristics and representational de-
vices. Instead, we made an effort to select the constituents that are uncontroversial in drama, with
a clear commitment to being as theory aspecific
as possible. In the future, the ontology may be
extended to represent the requirements of specific
theories and tasks, without hopefully affecting the
applicability of its core structures.

In the rest of this section, we first (Section 4.1)
introduce the conceptual apparatus made available by AI to deal with the domain described in
Section 2; then we describe the Drammar ontology (Section 4.2). By doing so, we provide a clear
distinction between Drammars ontological commitment towards the notions surveyed in Section
2 and the modeling solutions it borrows from previous work in fields that are not inherently related

V. Lombardo et al. / Coupling conceptual modeling and rules for the annotation of dramatic media

with drama. Finally 4.3, we describe the annotation example.

4.1. Bridging Dramatic Qualities onto Formal

Representation

As surveyed in Section 2, given Aristotles seminal definition of drama as imitation of praxis
[3], we take (characters) intentional actions as the
building blocks of drama. Characters commit and
execute actions intentionally, in order to achieve
their individual goals, thus facing conflicts that
develop into a well structured plot thanks to the
authors craftsmanship. A dramas sense of wholeness stems from the orchestrated contributions of
the single advancements brought about by its con-
stituents, the drama units, where characters actions (and events) are encapsulated. Drama units,
through the incidents they contain, affect the characters state, so that, by the end of the plot, the
characters conflicting goals will be achieved or
frustrated.

In order to represent the interplay of actions
and intentions that underlies the account provided
above, a model of agency is needed that ties intentions to actions into a unifying perspective. Inspired by Dennetts intentional stance [25], the
theory of bounded rationality [10,94], provides an
account of how agents mental states determine
their practical behavior.

A formal account of the theory of bounded rationality is provided by the BDI model [20]. According to the BDI model, an agent is a tripartite
function of Beliefs, Desires (or Goals), and Intentions (or Plans of actions, see below), where beliefs are the knowledge of the agent (what she/he
knows or believes to be true), goals are the objectives to be achieved through plans of actions, Following Feagins [37] intuition that the paradigm of
BDI agents can be applied to drama characters,
the representation of characters in Drammar relies
on the BDI model, i.e., characters are represented
as having goals and executing plans to achieve
them. According to Feagin [37], Carrols notion of
narrative closure [15] can be accounted for by the
BDI model, since it describes the characters behavior as consequential to their goals and plans.
As a consequence of the adoption of an actional
perspective, the representation of plans is also relevant for Drammar. In Drammar, plans are represented according to a STRIPS-like format [40], i.e.,

a plan is formed by a sequence of actions and has
precondition and effect states; moreover, in order
to account for the different granularity of units in
drama structure, a plan can encompass not only
actions but also subplans, according to the well
known paradigm of hierarchical planning [92]3.

Notwithstanding the explanatory power of the
BDI model for characters behavior, this model
does not account for characters emotions, that
have been acknowledged to play an important role
in drama. In drama, emotions are necessary to
establish an emotional bond between the characters and the audience, thus promoting and guaranteeing the process of emotional participation.
Based on previous work in characters emotions
[33,66,67], we assume the well known cognitive
model of emotions stated by [78], according to
which characters emotions stem from their appraisal of plot incidents in terms of the consequences they have on their goals and beliefs, with
a moral component to bridge the subjective judgment onto the culturally and socially determined
moral values. In particular, Drammar includes the
notion of moral value to represent the characters moral component, which enables the generation of moral emotions [5].

The theoretical framework introduced so far
provides the primitives (goal, beliefs, intentions)
that are necessary to represent the characters intentional behavior in drama. However, this apparatus must be integrated with representational devices that are suitable to describe how characters
actions are eventually structured into a timeline.
In Drammar, logical accounts of world dynamics,
such as Situation Calculus [71], have inspired the
representation of the timeline. Being a dynamic,
temporal medium, drama unfolds through a sequence of states that occur as a consequence of the
incidents contained in units, bringing about relevant changes in drama world, and in characters in
particular; stated form the precondition and the
effects of incidents. This representation requires
that the ontology vocabulary acknowledges the
distinction between states and processes, which realize the transitions. The representation of drama
also requires to account for the relations of states
and processes with non-temporal entities, such as

3The resulting representation can also be expressed using standard languages for plan representation, e.g., PDDL
[42].

agents and objects, i.e. to represent explicitly the
role of characters and objects in states and processes (e.g. an object located in a given place, or a
characters playing the role speaker in an asking ac-
tion). In Drammar, the distinction between states
and processes on the one side, and agents and objects on the other side, is inspired by the Endurant
and Perdurant distinction in DOLCE ontology,
while the representation of how characters (and
objects) take part in processes and states with different roles, relies on the ontology design patterns
defined on the top of DOLCE ontology [44]. Beside
representing standard, interoperable design solu-
tions, such design patterns incorporated in Drammar for the description of incidents and states are
easily mapped onto the linguistic description of
events in terms of a role structure provided by linguistic frames such as FrameNet [4]. In FrameNet
the linguistic description of an event is represented
by mapping the syntactic constituents of the description onto the set of roles that constitute the
frame of the event. In Drammar, by using the Time
Indexed Situation design pattern [44], the participants to a given situation (either a state or a pro-
cess) are mapped onto the set of roles included in
the situation description according to FrameNet
[17].

In order to enrich the description of drama incidents and of the entities which participate in
them, it is necessary to account for their qualities.
For example, an action can be performed slowly,
an object can be red, or steady, and so on. The
solution adopted in Drammar for the representation of the qualities of entities and processes (in-
cluding information about their type, such as an
agent be a woman or a process being a murder-
ing), is to include in the ontology some specific
classes that interface drama entities with external
knowledge. In particular, Drammar relies on two
external largescale semantic resources for the description of the commonsense knowledge, namely
the Suggested Upper Merged Ontology (SUMO,
[79]) and Yet Another Great Ontology (YAGO
[98]), merged into YAGOSUMO [24], which provide very detailed information about millions of
situations, including entities (agents and objects),
processes/actions, and events. Terms in YAGO
SUMO are accessed through a lexical resource, the
WordNet lexical data base [73], to increase the interoperability of the annotation data across lan-
guages.

4.2. Drammar

In this section, we introduce the ontology Dram-
mar, encoded in the OWL 2 RL language. The
choice of a language is an important design issue since it impacts on modeling and querying
the knowledge base with the tradeoff between
expressivity and complexity. One of the mainstream languages for defining knowledge bases is
OWL 2 (Web Ontology Language 2) described in
[74]. Since OWL 2 is a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommendation, it is supported
by several available ontology-related tools (such
as Prot eg e4). In particular, three OWL 2 profiles
have been defined (formally, an OWL 2 profile is
a sub-language of OWL 2 featuring limitations on
the available language constructs and their usage):

 OWL 2EL, based on the EL++ description
logics family, which simply supports existential quantification, allowing to perform basic
reasoning in polynomial time with respect to
the size of the ontology;

 OWL 2 QL, based on the logic underpinning
of DL-LiteR [13], usually employed in query
answering applications that use very large volumes of instance data (the expressive power
of this profile is quite limited);

 OWL 2 RL, based on a syntactic and semantic restriction of OWL 2, which provides an
enhanced expressive power and efficient reasoning mechanisms, and allows for the implementation of additional reasoning mechanisms through the extension of rule-based en-
gines.

As a matter of fact, the choice of the language OWL 2 RL, was driven by the need of
building an expressive ontology-driven rule based
system for computing emotional and motiva-
tional/intentional features of drama, respectively.
Drammar has been designed with the twofold
goal of providing a formalized conceptual model of
the dramatic elements described in Section 2, and
an annotation schema for encoding the description
of a dramatic item. So, along with classes that represent the domain of drama, it contains specific
classes that are intended for interfacing the representation of drama with linguistic and common
sense knowledge.

that allow the description of instantiated drama;
OrderedListElement. Each class has then a number of subclasses; here we will describe the most
relevant for our scope. An available version of the
ontology can be downloaded at http://www.di.
unito.it/~vincenzo/FTP_SWJ/.

The Drama Entity class is divided into three
subclasses, each describing specific drama ele-
ments. Drama Perdurant and Drama Endurant
represent, respectively, the processes that occur in drama, and the entities that participate
in them. Drama Structure subsumes
specific
classes for representing the structures of the story,
which include sequential structures (DramaList),
such as plans and timelines, and set structures
(DramaSet), such as units, scenes, which group elements of the same type. The Timeline class represents the indexing of units along time, and the
Plan class, which represents plan that can be hierarchically organized. While the former mainly
accounts for the causal links among the actions
encoded the plans executed by the characters, the
latter accounts for the temporal ordering of units
in the plot.

The DramaEndurant class (Fig. 2) subsumes the
story entities participating in the unit, namely
Agent (representing the characters that intentionally act in the incidents), and Object (the entities
that do not have own intentions).

The Drama Perdurant class provides the elements for the story dynamics, namely processes
and states, represented by the subclasses Process
and State, respectively.

Both processes and states are divided according to a distinction between eventive and factual,
following a tradition dating back to [85]; while
the latter are embedded in propositional attitudes,
such as beliefs and goals (i.e. a factual state is the
object of a goal), the former are further structured
into a hierarchy of classes that accounts for the different roles of processes and states in drama repre-
sentation. The EventiveProcess class includes intentional and unintentional processes (Action and
UnintentionalEP respectively); actions can occur
in units or be included in plans (ActionInUnit
and ActionInPlan).

The State class is divided into StateOfAffairs,
MentalState, and Done; the latter class includes
those states that represent the completions of pro-
cesses. Mental states are the core of the descrip-

Fig. 1. Layers of Drammar.

The representation of drama encoded in the ontology is basically structured into three layers,
sketched in Fig. 1. The basic layer (Actional Layer)
is given by the observable actions, grouped into
units and organized into a timeline. The data contained in this layer are entirely annotated by hand,
while the other two layers contain both manually encoded data and inferred relations among
the data, and among the layers in particular. The
middle layer (Motivational Layer) represents the
agents plans and the goals to which they are re-
lated; plans are mapped onto the observed actions
contained in the Actional Level through a mapping process encoded in a set of SWRL rules. The
top layer (Dramatic Layer) represents the contents
of scene, which basically consists of emotions, i.e.
the dramatic qualities par excellence (see Section
2.1.6). Emotions are appraised from the representation of agents plans and goals, and of the conflicts that arise from them. The appraisal process
is also encoded in a set of SWRL rules, which augment the scenes with the agents emotions. These
layers are not formally represented in the ontology,
which provides a description of dramatic qualities
by abstracting from their source in the annotation
process, i.e., if they are manually encoded or inferred through the use of the rules.

Fig. 2 shows the main classes of Drammar:
DramaEntity, grouping all the elements that belong to the drama domain, including the structural
elements; Description Template, containing all
the patterns for encoding linguistic schemata;
External Reference, bridging the core elements
of the ontology onto the external knowledge bases

tion of the intentional behavior of agents [38]; they
belong to one of the following classes:

 Belief: the agents subjective view of the

world;

 Emotion: what the agent feels;
 Goal: the objectives that motivate the actions

of the agents;

 Value: the moral values acknowledged by an
agent; values can be put at stake by the unfolding of the story (see the more specific class
ValueAtStake).

The ExternalReference class is aimed at representing the qualities needed to describe specific drama entities. Following the paradigm of
linked data [53], each different value of a quality
(named quale in DOLCE [69]) is referred via an
IRI pointing to some external common sense or
domain specific ontology. The property hasQuale
connects all classes with the ExternalReference
class; ExternalReference, then, connects to some
external IRI.

The Description Template class has the purpose of binding a situation, process or state, onto
its linguistic description. Its subclasses, namely
Role and Schema, provide the primitives needed to

realize a role schema. The Schema class represents
the description of a situation, process or state, in
terms of the roles involved in it (see the Situation Description ontology pattern [44]). In order
to map the participant entities (agent and objects)
to specific roles in the process or state, this class
is related to the Role class via the hasRole prop-
erty. As described in the previous section, roles are
then mapped onto the roles of linguistic frames in
FrameNet [4].

Fig. 3 describes the basic pattern for drama annotation in Drammar (some details are omitted for
the sake of readability). A drama Unit (bottom,
left) is related via the isInUnit property, to the
(instances of) ActionInUnit it contains. The unit
is connected to its preconditions and effects via the
hasUnitPrecondition and hasUnitEffect prop-
erties. A UnitState is a set encompassing several states, whose type can be StateOfAffairs,
Belief, ValueAtStake, or Done. States and actions are described (isDescribedBy) by a Schema,
which relies on some external reference for its description (see the hasExtRef propertis connecting
it to the ExternalReference class) and encompasses a set of roles (see the hasRole property
connecting this class to the Role class), filled by

some Agent or Object. An agent is endowed with
a set of mental states, represented by instances
of the Goal, Belief, Value and Emotion classes,
to which it is connected via specific properties
(hasGoal, hasBelief, etc.).

Situated at a higher level than observable ac-
tions, which constitute the drama incidents, plans
are tied to the unit content through states and en-
durants. An Agent intends a Plan (which achieves
her/his goals, see the achievedBy property connecting a Goal to a Plan); goals, together with
emotions, form the content of a Scene, to which
they are connected through the isInScene property (top right on Fig. 3). In scenes, goal can
be coherent or in conflict; a Plan, which belongs to a Scene (again, via the isInScene prop-
erty) has preconditions and effects, (through the
hasPlanPrecondition and hasPlanEffect prop-
erties) provided by Planstate. The structure of
PlanStates is the same as the UnitState class,
i.e., plan states are formed by a set of states
of different types. Plan states can contain instances of the ValueAtStake class, necessary to
express the fact that a plan puts at stake (or
brings back to balance) a Value. Plans contains

(containsOle) a set of elements (represented by
the OrderedListElement class), which point to a
ActionInPlan or a Plan (actually a subplan), thus
enabling the representation of hierarchical plans.
Following the same schema, a Timeline contains
a sequence of Unit elements.

4.3. Example annotation

We describe how drama can be represented
in Drammar by illustrating the annotation of
our running example, the nunnery scene from
Shakespeares Hamlet (see Section 2).

The scene (Scene WhereQuestion, see top of
Fig. 4) encompasses the conflicting goals of Hamlet
and Ophelia (G H AskR and G O Lie respectively),
and the plans they have devised to achieve them
(P H AskR and P O Lie), to which they are committed (i.e., that they intend, as expressed by the
intends property). Both agents have the value
of honesty (O Honesty and H Honesty). Here, we
show only the plan-related individuals that are relevant to the excerpt; the completed plans as shown
in Fig. 7. Hamlets plan contains the action of asking (A ask 01, OLE A ask 01); Ophelias plan con-

tains the action of lying (O lie 01, OLE O lie 01).
The same schema, PS aks, describes both Hamlets action of asking and the corresponding step of
his plan; the same holds for Ophelias planned and
executed actions, both described by the schema
PS lie. Hamlets and Ophelias executed actions
belong to the same unit (i.e., the basic container
of the actions displayed in drama, see Section 4.1),
Unit 17 WhereQuestion, to which they are linked
through the isInUnit property.

Fig. 5 represents the description of the actions of
asking and lying, executed, respectively, by Hamlet and Ophelia, trough the PS ask and PS lie
schemata. Each schema has a set of roles, filled
by Hamlet, Ophelia, and the content of the sentences they utter. For example, consider Hamlets action of asking to Ophelia the question
Where is your father? (Fig. 5, bottom left):
this sentence, encoded as as string, is the value
of the description data property of an individual of type Object (the class that encompasses all
the entities that do not have any intentions, no
matter if they are concrete or abstract objects).
This object is the filler (via hasFiller) of a role
(Message Quest) of the Schema describing the act
of asking, PS ask. The other roles, Topic Quest,
Addressee Quest and Speaker Quest (center of

figure) are filled, respectively, by an object that
stands for the topic of the question (Polonius
location), by the agent Ophelia as the addressee
and by the agent Hamlet as the speaker. Ophelia
and Hamlet are also the fillers of the roles of Ophelias action of lying, described by PS Lie schema.
Both schemata, then, are connected, through the
hasExtRef property, to an individual of the type
ExternalReference, which bridges the description of the schema onto the external linguistic
and world knowledge through the quale prop-
erty. Here, each instance of the quale property
points, for each schema, to the IRI of the actions description in Wordnet, in YagoSumo and
in FrameNet. For the action of asking, they are
respectively the Wordnet synset, the concept investigating in YagoSumo and the Questioning
frame in FrameNet. Also notice that the roles
of each schema are named after the roles of the
FrameNet frame for the corresponding action.

Fig. 8 shows how the annotated unit (Unit-
WhereQuestion) is located on the Timeline of
the nunnery scene (TL Hamlet Nunnery). The latter is composed of (containsOle) a set of elements of type OrderedListElements, each of
which is linked to the corresponding unit through
the hasData property. The ordering is provided by

FactualState class.

the precedes property: for example, the element
that stands for the Unit WhereQuestion is preceded by the advice that Hamlet gives to Ophelia
to go to a nunnery and precedes Hamlets desper-
ation.

The temporal development of the agents plans,
instead, is represented separately and is potentially different from the unit ordering. Hamlets
plan in the example unit is described in Fig. 7.

As described in Section 4.2, plans are hierarchical objects, i.e. they contain not only actions but
also simpler plans. Here, the multiagent plan devised by Hamlet to learn about Ophelias honesty
(P H LearningHonesty, top of figure) includes two
subplans, the first of which consists of asking to
Ophelia where her father is (P H AskR), and the
second of which (P O Truth) consists of Ophelias
telling the truth, (notice that Ophelia is commit-

ted to a different plan, i.e., lying, see bottom of
figure). The recursive decomposition of plans into
simpler plans and actions is represented by using the OrderedListElement class in combination
with the precedes property. Plans also have preconditions and effects, represented in Drammar
as instances of type PlanState. Similarly to Unit
preconditions and effects, plan states encompass a
set of states of different type, which include beliefs,
world states and, as in this case, agents values put
at stake. For example, the preconditions of Hamlets plan (PState Pre P H LearningHonesty) include Hamlets belief that Polonius is in the
room (detailed out in Fig. 6) and the status
of being at stake of Hamlets Value Honesty
(H Honesty AtStake), brought back to balance by
the plan effect.

Finally, Fig. 9 exemplifies the annotation of
characters emotions. In Drammar emotions belong to Dramatic layer and are cognitive states
generated by the appraisal of situations and are
included in scenes. In the figure, Hamlet feels Reproach towards Ophelia. Hamlets emotional state
is represented by an individual of type Emotion
(EmoReproach H Scene WhereQuestion) which is
in the scene (isInScene) Scene WhereQuestion.
Hamlets emotion is describedBy an instance of
Schema, ES rep H SWQ, to which the information
about the emotion is attached. The schema, in
fact, specifies the relation of the emotional state
with the target of the emotion (Ophelia), the appraising agent (Hamlet) and the categorization of
the emotion as Reproach (in this work, we adopt a
specific set of emotion types, but this representation may be also connected to external ontologies
of emotions).

5. The rule component

The rules account for the mapping and emotion
appraisal operations, respectively (see the curved
dotted arcs in Fig. 1), augmenting the properties
by connecting the individuals of plan and unit, in
the case of mapping, and the individuals of scene,
plan and emotion, in the case of the appraisal.
Properties that are defined over classes are instantiated on individuals.

The rule component overcomes some expressive
limitations of the ontological language OWL 2 RL

the example unit.

Ophelia in the example unit. An agent has subjective values (hasValue), here O Honesty and H Honesty described

values of Hamlet and Ophelia, being subjective, are kept
distinct, although they both relate to the same external
reference.

and produces some novel interesting knowledge.
The combination of ontological representations,
expressed in some standard ontological language,
with some ontology-compliant rule languages is
not new (see, e.g., [1]). In the literature, different integration strategies between the rule and the
ontological components have been proposed and
several types of rule languages have been developed [31], such as Datalog and languages from

Lombardo et al. / Coupling conceptual modeling and rules for the annotation of dramatic media

the Answer Set tradition in logic programming.
This solution allows to reason in a closed world
assumption environment (differently from the ontological reasoning) and its non monotonic extensions allow to go beyond the classical ontological reasoning, which is focused on deduction. Another solution is the one pointed out by [50], working on the convergence of logic-programming and
description-logic, which they call DLP (Descrip-
tion Logic Programs). However, such an approach
has the limit of leaving both the rule and ontology language with very restrictive expressivity. For
such reason, different extensions in the direction
of logic programming and ASP on top of the DLP
fragment have been proposed. This trend led to
the realization of the Web Rule Language (WRL),
a W3C proposal that, however, has not received
much attention in both the academic and professional communities.

SWRL (Semantic Web Rule Language) is the
language born form the fusion of Rule ML and
OWL DL. It integrates OWL with a rule layer
built on top of it, adding the possibility to declare
arbitrary Horn clauses expressed as IF THEN
rules. A SWRL based system is therefore composed of ordinary OWL axioms plus SWRL rules.
The antecedents and consequents of the rules consist of lists of atoms, which may be OWL class ex-
pressions, property definitions, or built-ins. Most
of the current available DL reasoners, such as Pellet or Hermit support inferences based on SWRL.
Concerning the integration strategies, there are
two main approaches known in literature, both
strongly related to the languages used in real ap-
plications. The homogeneous approach assumes
a tight semantic integration between ontologies
and rules through a common underlying semantics and there is no distinction between rule predicates and ontology predicates. In such approach
the rules extend ontological axioms to include arbitrary Horn-like clauses. This is the case, for ex-
ample, of the above mentioned SWRL.

The second approach is based on the assumption
of a strict semantic separation between the ontology and rule components, respectively. The ontology is used as a conceptualization of the domain
and the rules are used to build some applicationspecific relations. The communication between the
two components is obtained via some interface
([31]). A classical example of such approach regards the use of Answer Set Programming [32],

where ontologies are dealt with as an external
source of information with a semantics treated sep-
arately. Nonmonotonic reasoning and rules are allowed in a decidable setting, as well as arbitrary
mixing of closed and open world reasoning.

In our system, we adopted the homogeneous approach using an additional component consisting
of a set of SWRL rules. This choice was driven by
many factors. First of all, SWRL plugins are available in well known software packages for ontology
editing, such as Prot eg e. This allows, from a practical perspective, to directly use a unique package
for the design and development of both the knowledge base and the rules. Then, we found easier to
ground both the ontological and the rule components on a common underlying semantics and under a common reasoning assumption (namely the
Open World Assumption). On the other hand, the
use of ASP or Datalog, despite their powerfulness
and the possibility of using available non monotonic extensions, was beyond our application scope
(extending with reasoning capabilities the conceptual knowledge expressed in the ontology). In order to enhance the system with the support of such
simple additional mechanisms, we used SWRL in
their DL-safe modality. This saves from undecidability and revealed to be enough for the current
development of the system. Thus, we posed the restriction that individual variables in a rule must
only bind to individuals named explicitly in the
underlying ontology. In such a way, it was also
possible to test directly the use of standard DL
reasoners. In the following sections, we report the
application of the SWRL rules for establishing a
mapping between plans and units that reveals intentionality of actions, and the computation of the
emotional states of the characters in the drama
(see the overview in Fig. 1).

5.1. Mapping Rules

The mapping rules were devised with the aim of
allowing a support for drama scholars based on the
explicitation of characters intentions connected to
the unit (a visualization interface provide immediate access to such information, see [65,64]). The
reasoning that we want to achieve by using this set
of rules is that one of obtaining a recognition of
equality between the actions (incidents) occurring
in the unit, and the action in plans, according to
some shared properties such as the fact that such

actions are represented by the same Schema with
the same Roles and Fillers. The result of the application of such rules is that the Timeline is augmented by interspersing units with precondition
and effect states (called UnitStates).

In detail, the mapping works as follows:

 match plan actions and unit incidents through
the equality of the description schema in the
antecedent of the rule; in the antecedent the
rule also identifies the individuals to be connected in the consequent;

 project the states required by the plan as preconditions or effects (the plan states) onto
the unit preconditions and effects (the unit
states).

The SWRL rule is the following (syntax slightly
adapted for readability issues, match the items of
the description in Fig. 11):

aip is an instance of the class ActionInPlan,
contained in a Plan p,
through the OrderedListElement ole action el AND
p has a precondition (property hasP lanP recondition)

the PlanState AND

p has an effect (property hasP lanEf f ect) the Plan-

State ps ef f AND

aiu is an instance of the class ActionInUnit con-

tained in a Unit u AND

aip and aiu have the same description Schema ps aip

u has a precondition (property hasU nitP recondition)

the UnitState us pre AND

u has an effect (property hasU nitEf f ect) the Unit-

State us ef f

each State s pre contained in UnitState is inserted

(property hasSetM ember) into us pre AND

each State s ef f contained in UnitState is inserted

(property hasSetM ember) into us ef f

The ontology is initialized with the Timeline
that includes empty unit states that precede and
follow the units. Then, each application of the rule
fills the unit states with states contained in the
plans.

In the excerpt of the nunnery scene, we have
Hamlets plan P H AskR and its action A ask01 mapped onto the action I Ask U17 (Ham-
let asking Ophelia: Where is your father?) of

the Unit 17 WhereQuestion; the same happens
for Ophelias plan P O Lie, between the action
A lie 01 and the unit action I lie U17 (Ophe-
lia lying about Polonius location: At home, my
lord.). The higher plan P H LearningHonesty
(Hamlet) is then triggered because of the mapping
of the subplan P H AskR, though the latter fails in
achieving its goal.

5.2. Emotion and SWRL Rules

In order to automatize the annotation of characters emotions, we resort to a well known model of
emotions issued by cognitive studies [78], that has
been successfully applied to computational models
of characters [23,80,26], and on the computational
model presented in [6], that show an independent
approach to generate emotions into a BDI agent
extended with the notion of moral values.

Computational models of emotions rely on cognitive theories of emotions, which explain emotional states in terms of mental states (beliefs,
goals, etc.), thus sharing the same mentalistic assumption that characterizes intelligent agents. The
same holds for Drammar: as described in Section
4 characters are represented as augmented BDI
agents, i.e. characterized by belief, goals, intentions and values.

Fig. 12. A component model view of computational appraisal models from [68].

Appraisal theories assert that emotional states
arise from the appraisal of the situations in
which the person who experiences the emotion is
involved. In the OCC appraisal theory [78] emotions types are defined based on their causes, i.e.
similar emotional states share similar causes. For
example, the emotion type Distress describes all
the emotions caused by a displeasing event, such as

the spanning of hierarchically higher plans with a number of units.

sadness, distress, frustration, etc.. OCC appraisal
theory arranges emotion types onto a hierarchical
organization, which is based on the type of appraisal that motivates a particular emotion type;
the three main categories are: Event-based emo-
tions, Attribution emotions and Attraction emo-
tions. The Event-based emotions are the result of
the appraisal of events as desirable (or undesir-
able) with respect to agents goals; Attribution
emotions are the result of the appraisal of actions
as praiseworthy (or blameworthy) with respect to
a set of standards for behavior; Attraction emotions are the result of the appraisal of objects
as liking (or disliking) an object with respect to
agents attitudes.

Last, from the combination of Well-being emotions and Attribution emotions, the Compound
emotions are triggered. Compound emotions arise
when the same situation is appraised at the same
time as an action and an event.

Relying on the computational model presented
in [6], that presents an explicit link between moral

values and moral emotions5, we encode the OCC
theory in the Drammar ontology using SWRL
rules, in order to automatically generate the emotions of the characters in a scene. We define SWRL
rules for all the emotions categories defined in the
OCC theory [78], with the exception of the Attraction category consisting of Love and Hate. These
emotion types are annotated manually because the
OCC theory doesnt include structural rules to appraise them. As matter of fact, Love and Hate
immediately descend from the primitive attitudes
like/dislike toward some entity. Therefore in the
annotation process (see Section 6) we annotate
them manually. This manual annotation is needed
because the appraisal rule of other emotion types
take them into account.

As in most computational models, we encode
emotions types (e.g., Distress) as individuals, that
encode all the family emotions (under the Distress

5Other approaches model moral emotions in a strictly

domain dependent manner [33,45,26,87,67].

type) defined in the OCC theory. So, the set of
SWRL rules infers emotion types for characters
involved in a scene.

Following [68], the SWRL rule antecedent encodes the Appraisal Derivation model, while the
SWRL rule consequent asserts the emotion type
felt by the appraising agent, encoding the Affect Derivation Model (see Fig. 12). The Appraisal
Derivation Model defines how the set of appraisal
variables is derived from the mental state of the
agent. For example, if an agents desire is not
achieved in a situation, the appraisal derivation
model should be able to derive that the situation
is undesirable for the agent. Taking as input the
set of appraisal variables, the Affect Derivation
Model generates the corresponding affective state,
according to the referred theory. The SWRL rule
antecedent represents the appraisal of the character and it is based on the properties of the characters goals, values and plans (e.g. a goal achieved,
a value put at stake and an intended plan). The
SWRL rule consequent asserts what emotions are
felt in a given scene, who feels emotions (property
feels of the class Agent), the cause of the emotions (property target of the class Emotion), and
the appraising agent (appraisingAgent property
of the class Emotion).

In Fig. 13, we illustrate the SWRL rules concerning emotion appraisal with a tree represen-
tation: starting from the root, each path in the
tree that arrives at some boxed term represents
a SWRL rule. Note that each branch is not ex-
clusive, rules can fire in parallel: according to the
OCC theory, different emotions can be felt at the
same time, without exceptions. This means, that
a character can possibly feel, for example, Joy and
Distress in the same scene.
The root node sets the Agent SA that feels the
emotion(s) as a consequence of the achievement of
the Goal G in the Scene S by some Plan P . The
next level tests whether the emotion is caused by
a goal (i.e. OCC Event-based emotions category)
or by some agent that intends a Plan P that affects a Value V of the Agent SA, in its effects (for-
mally, a ValueAtStake V AS, featuring V )  (i.e.
OCC Attribution emotions category). Following
the path for the emotions targeted to goal (left),
we need to discriminate whether the consequences
are for the self Agent SA or another Agent OA.
The node Consequences for other specifies that
another Agent OA, an individual different from

SA, intends a Plan P OA to achieve some Goal
G OA in the scene. The derivation of the appraisal
variable Desirable is based on the coherence of
the Goal G OA with the goal G, achieved in the
same Scene S. This means that G works in favor
of G OA. If the Agent SA feels a Love Emotion for
the Agent OA, the SWRL consequent asserts that
the Agent SA feels a Happy-for emotion with the
Goal G as the target of the emotion and SA is the
appraisingAgent; if the Agent SA feels a Hate
emotion, the SWRL consequent asserts a Resentment emotion. When the Goal G and the Goal
G OA are in conflict, the event is appraised as undesirable by the Agent SA. If SA feels Love for the
Agent OA, the SWRL consequent asserts a Pity
emotion, if the Agent OA is hated by the Agent
SA the Gloating rule fires and the Agent SA feels
a Gloating emotion.
The appraisal variable Consequences for self specifies that the Agent SA has a Goal G SA. If a
Plan P SA exists, intended by the Agent SA that
achieves the goal G SA, the agent is appraising the
desirability of a prospect event. The presence of a
conflict between the Goal G SA and Goal G discriminates whether the prospect event is desirable
or undesirable for the Agent SA. If the Goal G is
coherent with the Goal G SA, the Agent SA feels
a Hope emotion; otherwise, if the agents goal is
in conflict with G, the Agent feels a Fear emotion.
For the prospect emotions that follow Fear and
Hope emotions, such as Satisfaction, the variables
Confirmation and Dis-confirmation are based on
the goal achievement: if an agent feels Hope and
the Goal G SA is achieved, the SWRL rule for
Satisfaction emotion category fires; otherwise, the
agent feels a Disappointment emotion. When the
Goal G SA is in conflict with the Goal G and its
achievement data property is true, the agent feels
a Relief emotion towards its goal; if the undesirable event is confirmed and the agents goal is not
satisfied, the agent feels a Fear-confirmed emotion.
Note that, as reported in Fig. 13, the Hope and
Fear emotions are part of the SWRL antecedent
for the generation of the other prospect emotions
categories.

The SWRL rules for Joy and Distress do not
consider if the agent intends a plan to achieve a
goal and the appraisal variables Desirable and Undesirable are derived, besides the coherence or the
conflict with the Goal G, from the goal achievement of the goal G SA. The complete rule for Dis-

the Agent SA (this is the agent who feels the emo-
tion). In particular, the effect planstate includes
a ValueAtStake V AS, which features the Value
V . The property Target of the class Emotion (i.e.
the cause of the emotion) has as range the class
Agent and not the class Goal, as it happens for
the left sub-tree. If it is the Agent SA who intends
the Plan P , the SWRL rules for Pride and Shame
fire, depending on whether the value ends to be in
balance or at stake, respectively, and the target of
the emotion is the Agent SA herself/himself. In
fact, the nodes tagged with the variables in balance and at stake define the praiseworthiness and
blameworthiness appraisal dimension presented in
the OCC theory: the praiseworthiness and blameworthiness of an action depend on the state of
the agents values, that can be put in balance or
at stake, respectively. In case it is another Agent
OA who intends the Plan P , the SWRL rules for
Admiration and Reproach fire, again depending
on whether the value ends to be in balance or at
stake, respectively, and the target of the emotion is
the Agent OA. Here is the SWRL rules for Shame

Note also that, the appraisal of Joy emotion is

is itself a desirable event; conversely, the confirmation of an undesirable event is an undesirable
event, and the appraisal of the Distress emotion is
contained in the appraisal of the Disappointment
emotion category.

Following [78,6], the Compound SWRL rules require the appraisal of the emotions with target
goals and agents at the same time. For example,
if an agent SA feels a Distress emotion with target one of its goals G SA and a Reproach emotion with target the agent OA that, performing
a plan, put at stake one of SAs values, then the
agent feels an Anger emotion with target the agent
OA. Here is the rule for Anger emotion type (see

In the following (Fig. 18 and Fig. 19), we describe the activation of the Reproach, Anger and
Shame SWRL rules for the agents Hamlet and
Ophelia in the running example of the nunnery scene (Section 4.3); in particular, we return on the excerpt of the semantic annotation
in Drammar of the Scene Scene WhereQuestion,
in which Hamlet puts Ophelia on a test to verify her honesty and Ophelia decides to lie about
the location of her father Polonius. We only report the salient individuals that are needed to illustrate the activation of the Distress, Reproach,
Anger and Shame SWRL rules. The Scene Scene -
WhereQuestion has two Agent: Hamlet and Ophe-
lia. In Fig. 18, the Agent Hamlet has the Goal

In Fig. 19, the Agent Ophelia has the Value

6. Evaluation

In this section, we describe an evaluation of the
rulebased component of the Drammar ontology in
terms of the support it provides to drama studies
and didactics.

Because of the increasing production of fiction
as Film, Tv, and New Media industry, drama studies are leaving the realm of literature to develop
structured formats for industrial production. In
the last decades, in schools and universities the
focus of the drama courses has switched from literary to structural and actional qualities. This
means that the text is more and more intended
both as an incident design (either on stage or on
screen) and as a network of relations over agents
intentions, which also result in the appraisal of
emotions. For example, McKee [72] guides the
author through the scene by splitting beats according to the characters actional goal, and its
value change, with the consequent rise and fall
of emotional states. This information (that creates a sense of dramatic actions), which is missing
from the text and is the gap filled by the audi-
ence, is the object of the analysis by drama schol-

ates the ontology onto a drama item, with its Ac-
tion, Unit, Agent, Plan, State, . . . , components,
and applied the rules to establish the mapping
intentionsactions and to appraise the emotions
felt by the agents, thus augmenting the annotation
as described in Fig. 1.

In the rest of this section, we present the workflow of the annotation task, the role of the ontology and the rulesystem in bridging the gap over
actionsintentionsemotions and an analysis of the
effectiveness of the rule system in the case of the
emotion appraisal.

6.1. Workflow of the annotation task

The annotator, be her/him a scholar or an
amateur, breaks drama into units (Segmentation
phase, Fig. 20), and defines a timeline of units.
Units are independently identified through the
boundaries of the actions.6 Then, he/she annotates the metadata for each unit, encoding the
characters actions and the entities involved, according to the Drammar ontology (Manual Annotation phase), following the basic annotation pattern described in Fig. 3. At the same time, a drama
scholar identifies the characters goals and plans
(intentions) that motivate the actions of the units
and bridge the gap between the intentions of the
agents and the incidents identified by the annota-
tor.

The annotation proceeds by introducing the description of the entities of the story (agents and ob-
jects) and retrieving the templates for actions, filling the template roles with the story entities identified before. The appropriate action templates are
identified through natural language terms that access the external lexical and commonsense knowledge resources (respectively, FrameNet and Yago-
Sumo, accessed via WordNet). For example, to annotate Hamlets action testing, the annotator
starts by searching some word she/he thinks is
appropriate for describing it (in the current im-
plementation, the Italian verb esaminare); then,
he/she selects the appropriate Wordnet synset
(the number 61, in this case); finally, the system
retrieves the frames that are mapped onto such
synset in FrameNet, from which she/he selects the

segmentation of a drama reveals to be highly consistent
among annotators.

frame that is the most significant for the situation
(here questioning). As a result, the application
shows the roles to be filled for the selected frame
(here, Speaker, Addressee, Topic, Message), that
the annotator fills with the entities that have been
already annotated (Agent Hamlet, Agent Ophe-
lia, Object Polonius location, Object Where is
your father?). When the annotator inserts some
metadata (e.g., an Action name) the corresponding Java class creates the fragments of the ontology
that stores the related instance, connected with all

the other instances through the appropriate class
toclass properties.

Then, the system applies the rules for mapping
actions onto plans and units and for appraising
the emotions felt by the agents (Reasoning phase),
thus producing an augmented annotation.

6.2. Bridging the representation gap

Drama is the audiences cognitive appraisal of
both the characters intentions and the events that
take place. In the famous example by M. Forster,
the phrase The king died and then the queen
died is a chronicle, while The king died, and
then queen died of grief is a plot, because the
latter builds upon cause and effect nexus [41, p.
130]. Bringing the example further, and following
the description of drama qualities stated in the
Section 2, we could also say that a dramatization
of the same content would be:

The servant: (Entering the room) Her majesty,
the King is dead. The Queen: (Falling on the floor )
Argh!.

Understanding the dramatic text is a complex
operation that implies, for example, filling gaps
such as the lack of an explicit relation between the
two events (the queen dies because of the news),
matching the nexus between a verbal expression
and an action (the servants communication and
the Queens falling), attributing emotions and values to the situation, and reconstructing the mental states of the agents (the Queen dies of grief
because she loved the King). Thus, also in this
oversimple example, we see that the dramatic text,
and the dramatic performance in particular, plays
upon an interwoven relation between the sequence
of actions (or timeline) and the mental states (mo-
tivations, emotions, etc.) that we infer from it.

In the nunnery scene we have employed as
running example in this paper, Hamlets questioning builds upon a complex mental process, being
part of a plan to test Ophelias honesty. If the audience only appraised the action performed, i.e.
the question Where is your father?, this would
be read just as a meaningless lunatic behavior.
The cognitive construct we call character is the
outcome of the readers interpretation, based not
only upon the mere represented actions but also
upon its enrichment with the motivations that

can be inferred from them. The character does
not coincide with the agent in the narration and
is more than its narrative container [77]. Our appraisal of Hamlets action in this excerpt depends
upon our interpretation of his behaviors and mental states. There is a vast literature upon this
line (Where is your father) that can be summarized in two main approaches: those who believe
that he does not know the answer (and tend toward an inner psychological interpretation of the
two lovers loneliness), and those who think he
knows hes being spied (and put the accent on
the Elsinors intrigues) [90] [97] [102] [59]. This
proliferation is possible because of the huge gap
that exists between the mere action and the intention the audience recognizes behind it, or, in other
words, between the actions Hamlet is planning and
the action he is actually displayed as performing.
The character results comprehensible and believable only if this gap can be filled by the reader
through a cause-effect chain, and this is why a simple lunatic behavior would not fit into the scene,
and is not taken into account by our interpretative process. The interpretative process is the field
where drama studies have proliferated, and have
been carried out mainly by means of re-narration.
For example, the seminal work of Harold Bloom
on Shakespearian characters is mainly a new personal narrative of the plays [8]. Our system succeeds in giving a formal representation of this operation providing an explicit automatic mapping
between the actions in the plans and the action in
the timeline.

As shown in Fig. 4, the actions in the unit (and
in the timeline) account for the execution of two
plans aimed at achieving two conflicting goals.
From a literary point of view, the audience of a
drama can be focused on the quality of the verse,
on the rhythm of the prose, even on the specific
style of event design. From the storytelling point
of view, it is important to measure the cognitive
and emotional appraisal of actions and events. To
appreciate the actional qualities of a drama, the
reader must learn to focus on the precondition and
effects that hold before and after the unit. Thanks
to those, the audience is able to appraise the characters change, and the final results of the conflicts (see 2.1.3). Therefore, the mental states in
the augmented representation are the key elements
that allow the audience to build his/her cognitive
representation of drama. Specifically, characters

V. Lombardo et al. / Coupling conceptual modeling and rules for the annotation of dramatic media

mental states cannot be described if not as result
of characters deliberation, therefore by using the
mapping of plans and incidents.

The emotional charge of the scene (consider the
dialogue Where is your father?/At home, my
Lord) is usually described in the traditional mise
en sc`ene, by focusing on the conflict between the
two goals. Hamlet wants to learn about Ophelias honesty; hence, he puts her on a test; Ophelia needs to comply with her Father Polonius and
Kings authority and avoids to disclose the plot
(hence, she lies). Given the two plans and the value
at stake (honesty), the system succeeds in calculating the resulting characters emotional charge.
Following OCC rules, as stated in Section 5.2, the
system outputs Hamlets reproach and Ophelias
shame as the emotions triggered in the scene that
corresponds to the unit. This evidence would otherwise go lost or at most left to the readers free
interpretation. This does not mean that the scene
may have only one emotional interpretation, but
rather that our system formally shows that the
emotions have a direct link to the characters deliberative process and that the way we describe
the latter gives shape to the former.

6.3. Appraisal of emotions

In order to evaluate the coverage and effectiveness of the emotion rules, we carried out an experiment where the annotation of emotions performed by the system through the rules was compared with the annotation performed by human
experts.

Experimental protocol. As the first step, we selected a small corpus of dramatic works which,
in experts opinions, represent well the heterogeneity of drama (intended as cultural object
of Western culture, see Section 2). The corpus included two Hollywood movies, a romance and a
thriller (Casablanca by Michael Curtiz and North
by northwest by Alfred Hitchcock), an opera, Carmen (George Bizet, libretto of Henri Meilhac and
Ludovic Halvy), and the Greek tragedy Oedipus
the King (Sophocles). The prevalence of the Hollywood movies was determined by the involvement of the students of the cinema studies cur-
riculum. The goal of the experiment was to assess the overlapping between the emotional ranges
of the characters calculated through the applica-

tion of the emotion rules and the emotional range
identified by the human annotators. For emotional
range, we intend the list of the emotion types felt
by the character in a given work. So, we compare the differences detected in the two ranges
in terms of precision and recall. Following the
workflow illustrated above, each drama was segmented in units and analyzed by an annotator
who identified the segments main incidents, annotated the main actional elements of the units and
finally the emotions of the main characters based
on the OCC classification. The characters were:
for Casablanca, Rick, Lazlo and Ilsa; for North by
Northwest, Roger Thornill; for Carmen, Carmen,
Micaela and Don Jose; for Oedipus Rex, Oedipus.
The annotators were students of the Media and
Arts program, trained in dramatic narration; each
work was annotated by a different annotator, selected based on her/his familiarity with the work.
The annotators were asked to use the emotion labels from the OCC theory of emotions, taking into
account the critical studies of the work to be an-
notated. Subsequently, for each segment identified
by the annotator, a drama scholar annotated the
goals, plans, and values involved in the segment in
the formal language of Drammar. Then, the annotation was fed to a reasoner7 to apply the SWRL
emotion rules. Finally, we collected the emotion
types annotated for each character by the human
annotator and those computed by the system. The
resulting sets of emotion types allow for the comparison between the human and system annota-
tions, since the output of the rules strongly depends on the annotation of the characters actions
and motivations (mediated through plans, goals,
and values).

Results. The results are presented in Table 1 in
terms of precision and recall. The average recall
is 91.6%, the precision is 66.6%. These results are
coherent with the structure of the rule system.
Recall was expected to be high: since the rules
were applied on the description of the events provided by the human annotators, we expected the
same emotions to be generated by the rule system
and the human annotators, with few exceptions.
In fact, we also expected that the encoding in the
formal language of the ontology would introduce

7Pellet, www.clarkparsia.com/pellet

some small differences between the description of
the incidents provided by the human annotators,
and its representation in Drammar. On the con-
trary, precision was expected to be low, because
the rules make all the possible emotions emerge
from the annotation of the incidents, while usually
only some of them are truly relevant according to
the human judgment.

At the character level, there are some differences between the precision and recall of emotional ranges generated by the rules, especially
concerning the precision values. These differences
are not related with the drama type: for example,
the false positives were 5 out of 9 for Carmen (one
of the main characters of the musical drama with
the same name), thus yielding the lowest precision value in the entire experiment, 44,4%, and 2
out of 9 for Don Jose, the male character of the
same drama (yielding the highest precision value,
81.8%).
Less differences emerge concerning the recall,
which ranges from 77,7% of Oedipus (Oedipus
Rex ) to the 100% of Don Jose (Carmen), Micaela (Carmen), Roger (North by Northwest), Ilsa
(Casablanca) and Lazlo (Casablanca). As stated
above, in fact, rules tend to be more productive
than human annotators, thus resulting in high recall values.

Discussion. If we look more carefully at the differences between the emotional ranges annotated
by the humans and those generated by the rules,
we observe that these differences are due to the
fact that the extra emotion types generated by the
rules are implied by the emotion types annotated
by the human annotators, even if not explicitly assigned to the characters by them (Table 2). From
the annotation data, we observe that the human
annotators tend to skip emotion types that are included or implied by other emotion types. So, although the number of emotions computed by the
rules was larger than those annotated by the hu-
mans, the extra emotion types (false positives according to the human annotators) are still compliant with the OCC theory encoded in the rules. For
example, according to OCC, if Rick feels Disap-
pointment, he must also feel Hope at some point of
the unit, but the latter was not annotated by hu-
man; similarly, even if less immediate, when Carmen feels Anger toward somebody, she also feels
Reproach for her/him and Distress for some goal

in conflict with one of her goals. In general, according to the theory, the following relations between
emotions hold:

 Hope is a precondition to Disappointment and
Satisfaction, so it must be generated any time
Disappointment or Satisfaction are generated.
Fear is a precondition to Fear-confirmed and
Relief, so it is generated when the two are
generated.

 Compound emotions (Anger, Remorse, Ad-
miration, Pride) are composed from primitive emotions; so, for each of them, the system needs to generate one of the preliminary Well-being emotions (Joy, Distress) and
one of the preliminary Attribution emotions
(Pride, Shame, Admiration,Reproach).

 The appraisal of Disappointment and Satisfaction includes, respectively, the appraisal
of Distress and Joy, so the system generates
both. The same holds for Fear-confirmed and
Relief, whose appraisal includes, again, Joy
and Distress.

So, if we consider the dependencies listed above,
and consequently remove from the false positives
the emotions that are implied by the OCC theory (provided that are implied by an emotion type
upon which there is agreement between the human annotator and the rules), the precision of the
rule system increases significantly, from the initial
66,6% to 84,6% (Table 3). Even if there is still
room for improvement, we think that this result
can be considered a valuable one.

Some of the discrepancies are related to the annotation of the linear succession of events that currently is left unmarked within a unit. So, cases
in which the human annotates Disappointment
about some state of affairs can be interpreted by
the system as Fear towards that state, because the
system does not compute the intermediate emotion Hope that leads to Disappointment when the
state hoped for fails. Moreover, the discrepancies
can be due to a focus of the human annotator on
some specific temporal perspective on the event:
for example, in some cases the annotator annotates
Hope as the prevalent emotion of a scene, although
the goal is subsequently reached and so the system
automatically annotates both Hope and Satisfac-
tion.

In general, we also need a more thorough evaluation of the system with a set of annotators for

each drama, in order to limit the arbitrariness of
the comparison (this is why we limited this preliminary evaluation to the emotion type range, instead of considering the emotion tokens). However,

consider that such a schema would require a more
complex experiment design: first, each annotator
would provide her/his own segmentation and annotation of the major components: though the in-

ter annotator agreement is normally high for seg-
mentation, the annotation cannot be assumed to
yield a good agreement (beside, it is appreciated
to keep the differences in the annotation, due to
the considerations made in 6.2). Then, different
scholars can annotate different intentions, consistent with this or that annotator. Finally, the differences of perspective addressed by annotators and
scholars can lead to various considerations that
can be hardly interpreted and removed. To overcome these difficulties, we are designing an incremental process of annotation that can be implemented by a community of annotators and contribute to preserve the knowledge about drama,
while at the same time addressing the many issues of formal analysis and the variety of teaching
methods.

7. Conclusions

This paper has presented an ontological approach to the domain of drama. The importance
of the domain of drama is addressed in its crosscultural presence and in the wide amount of media items that fall into this domain. The relevance
of this cultural object is well established in domain specific literature (drama critics, dramatic
storytelling, new media narrative), but it has not
been yet provided with a domain specific significant metadata to improve access and retrievability of the large repository available (from text to
video archives). The ontology Drammar is aimed
at contributing to fill this gap.

Drammar consists of two components, encoding
the conceptual model and the mapping/appraisal
rules, respectively. After a brief description of
the theoretical background and of the conceptual
model, with the ontology main classes and properties encoded in OWL, the paper has focused on
the rule component. This consists of two sets of
rules encoded in SWRL. The first implements the
mapping operation, for projecting the motivations
of the drama characters onto the timeline of dramatic units; the second accounts for the emotion
appraisal, thus computing the emotional states of
the agents in the units from the plans they are
committed to, the goals they achieve, the values
that are put in balance or at stake, and the conflicts in which they are involved. The paper has finally presented a preliminary evaluation, in which

we test the expressiveness of this formalization and
its relevance for drama scholars, in both their research activity and the teaching activity.

A first experiment has been carried out on the
nunnery scene of Shakespeares Hamlet, to validate the mapping of characters intention over ac-
tions. The results have revealed a number of issues
that significantly characterize the drama and support the potentiality of the encoding in teaching.
A second experiment has been carried out on a
set of four dramatic works (from film to opera), to
validate the result of automatic emotion appraisal
compared to the emotion annotated by some media students. The results show that the automatic
system devised is consistent with the emotion perceived by humans.

We are going to develop a further module of
rules for the formulation of goals in response to
values that are at stake: these tasks, as well as
the selection of the plan to be committed, are the
typical realm of rules in the development of applications of automatic and interactive storytelling.
The long term aim is to see the convergence of annotation and production applications based upon
a common core conceptual modeling and rule composing as demonstrated in this paper.
