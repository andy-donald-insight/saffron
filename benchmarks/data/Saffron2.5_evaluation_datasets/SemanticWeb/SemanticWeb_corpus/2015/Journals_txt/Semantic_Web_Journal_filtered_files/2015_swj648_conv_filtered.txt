Abstract. Contributive resources, such as Wikipedia, have proved to be valuable to Natural Language Processing or multilingual
Information Retrieval applications. This work focusses on Wiktionary, the dictionary part of the resources sponsored by the
Wikimedia foundation. In this article, we present our extraction of multilingual lexical data from Wiktionary data and to provide
it to the community as a Multilingual Lexical Linked Open Data (MLLOD). This lexical resource is structured using the LEMON
Model.
This data, called DBnary, is registered at http://thedatahub.org/dataset/dbnary.

Keywords: Wiktionary, Multilingual, Lexical Resource, LEMON, Multilingual Linguistic LOD

1. Introduction

The GETALP (study group for speech and language
translation/processing) team of the LIG (Laboratoire
dInformatique de Grenoble) is in need of multilingual
lexical resources that should include language correspondences (translations) and word sense definitions.
In this regard, the data included in the different Wiktionary1 language editions is a precious mine.

Alas, many inconsistencies, errors and differences
in usage do exist in the different Wiktionary language
editions. Hence, we decided to make an effort to extract precious data from this source and provide it to
the community as Linked Data. After a first version
that used an RDF version of the LMF model [4,3] and
was described in [10], we decided to adapt our extrac-

tors to the LEMON model [8]. This linked dataset won
the Monnet-Challenge in 2012.

2. Extracting data from Wiktionary

2.1. Motivation

Errors and inconsistencies are inherent to a contributive resource like Wiktionary. Some language editions (like French and English) have many moderators who limit the number of inconsistencies among
entries of the same language. These languages, which
contain the most data, use many templates that simplify the extraction process. For instance, the translation section of the French Wiktionary always uses a
template to identify each individual translation (e.g.
{{trad+|de|Katze}} f is the wiki code used
for one of the German translations of the French word
chat).

This is not true anymore with less developed Wiktionary language editions. For instance, in the Finnish
edition, some translations into French are introduced
by the appropriate template (i.e. {{fr}}) while others are introduced by the string ranska which is the
Finnish translation for "French". In this case, the extractor needs to know the Finnish translations of all
language names to cope with the second case and avoid
losing almost half of the available translation data.

Such inconsistencies and some errors in the data
make the development of an extractor quite tedious.
As many people in NLP are trying to use these data
for different applications, we decided to extract lexical
data from as many Wiktionary language editions as we
could and provide it to the community while ensuring
interoperability with other lexical data.

The DBnary extractor is written in java and is
open-source (LGPL licensed, available at http:
//dbnary.forge.imag.fr). Anyone may contribute to this extraction effort by taking contact with
the author.

2.2. Scope of the extracted data

The main goal of our efforts is not to extensively reflect the content of Wiktionary, but to create a lexical
resource that is structured as a set of monolingual dictionaries complemented by bilingual translation infor-
mation. This way, the structure of extracted data follows the usual structure of Machine Readable Dictionaries (MRD). We originally extracted those data as
we needed translations in many languages along with
textual definitions of senses that we used to compute
semantic similarity between senses (using an adapted
Lesk measure) for the Blexisma multilingual lexical
disambiguation system [9].2 Such data are already useful for several applications, but are merely a starting
point for a future multilingual lexical database.

The monolingual data are always extracted from
their own Wiktionary language edition. For instance,
the French lexical data are extracted from the French
language edition.3 Hence, we completely disregard the
French data that may be found in other language edi-
tions.

We also filtered out some parts of speech in order
to produce a result which is closer to existing monolingual dictionaries. For instance, in French, we disregard abstract entries that are prefixes, suffixes or flexions (e.g.: we do not extract data concerning in- or -al
that are prefixes or suffixes and have a dedicated page
in the French language edition).

2.3. Availability of the extracted data

DBnary data are made available using a Creative
Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 license (c b a).
It may be downloaded from the DBnary website4 as a
set of turtle files (one per language).

As the Wiktionary language editions constantly
evolve with entry modifications and additions, the DBnary dataset also evolves. Each time the Wikimedia
foundation provides a new dump5 of a Wiktionary language edition, DBnary data are extracted with the new
dump and made available online. Older versions are
kept and remain available for further reference. At the
time of writing, the dumps are updated about once every ten days for each language.

DBnary data are also available as Linguistic Linked
Open Data (LLOD). All DBnary IRIs are dereferencable and a SPARQL endpoint is available at http:
//kaiko.getalp.org/sparql. However, as the
DBnary data change almost everyday, the data that is
available this way is not necessarily up to date.

2.4. Interlinking

Our work focuses only on the lexical data. Hence,
we do not provide any reference to any ontology.
Moreover, in this dataset, we only try to extract lexical
data from Wiktionary, but we do not try(yet) to enrich
it. Hence, this dataset is not (at the time of printing)
linked to other lexical linked data.

Also, any interlinking with DBnary data will require
that we take into account the constantly evolving nature of the dataset that changes every two days on average (as Wikimedia dumps are made available). In-
deed, there is a chance that URIs of lexical senses may
change between two versions as word senses may be
reordered in the original Wiktionary data.6 We believe

2We also used this dataset to build an UIMA component for
word sense disambiguation, more details are available at http:
//getalp.imag.fr/WSD

3We use the term French language edition to refer to the data

available on http://fr.wiktionary.org

4http://kaiko.getalp.org/about-dbnary
5dumps are available at http://dumps.wikimedia.org/.
6Strictly speaking, even URIs of lexical entries may change, but

this is even more unfrequent.

that such changes are rather unfrequent, but we still
have to find out a way to cope with them.

As the DBnary data have been extracted regularly
since almost one year, with about 25 different versions per language, diachronic studies may now be
performed to evaluate the frequency of such changes.
However, such studies are not trivial to implement as a
change in a definition does not necessarily imply that
the lexical sense has changed.

3. Extracted Data as a LEMON Lexical Resource

3.1. Using LEMON for legacy lexical data

The LEMON model itself is not sufficient to represent lexical data that are currently available in classical monolingual and bilingual dictionaries. For in-
stance, LEMON does not contain anything to represent
translations between languages as it assumes that such
a translation will be handled by the ontology descrip-
tion. Moreover, LEMON assumes that all data is wellformed and fully specified. As an example, the synonymy relation is a property linking a LexicalSense to
another LexicalSense. While it is correct to assume as
a principle, this does not account for the huge amount
of legacy data that is available in dictionaries and lexical databases.

As an example, in the English language edition, one
may find a synonymy relation between cat_n and bitch.
This relation links a Lexical Entry with a Vocable. Creating a corresponding lexico-semantic relation from
Lexical Sense to Lexical Sense would imply: (1) detecting the correct sense of cat_n (here sense #4/15); (2)
deciding which is the target lexical entry (here, bitch
has 2 lexical entries, but only one is nominal); (3) deciding which lexical sense it is (#2/9). As such a process is error prone, we decided to provide the data as
they appear in Wiktionary and to leave these decisions
to further processing.

In order to cope with these legacy data, we extended
the LEMON model by adding new classes and proper-
ties. However, when a piece of data is representable as
a LEMON entity, then we do it. Moreover, when pos-
sible, we use the ISOcat registry [11] to identify standard elements in the lexical data.

3.2. DBnary extension to LEMON

The LEMON model has been extended to cope with
legacy lexical data. Added classes and properties are:

Vocable: Several lexical entries may be contained in a
single Wiktionary page, and most lexical relations
are simply targeted to Wiktionary pages. Hence,
we introduced the dbnary:Vocable7 class to represent a Wiktionary page, as a reification of the
set of Lexical entries it contains. This class is a
subclass of lemon:LexicalEntry. Instances of that
class are related to their lexical entries through the
dbnary:refersTo property.

LexicalEntity: Lexical relations should usually link
two Lexical Senses. However, most relations
found in legacy lexical data are underspecified.
Some relations link a Lexical Sense to a Vocable
or to a Lexical Entry. Others even link two Lexical
Entries. In order to cope with such underspecified
relations, we introduced the dbnary:LexicalEntity
class which is the union of Lexical Entry and Lexical Sense.8

Nyms: Most Wiktionary language editions provide
nymy relations (mainly synonymy, antonymy,
hypernymy, hyponymy, meronymy and holonymy),
that are almost always underspecified. Hence,
DBnary introduces 6 new nymy properties (in
dbnary name space). The domain and range of
these relations are Lexical Entities.

Translations: As there is no way to represent bilingual translation relations in LEMON, we introduced the dbnary:Translation class that collects
translation information contained in Wiktionary.
This class admits several properties:
 dbnary:isTranslationOf relates the translation to
its source lexical Entity (i.e. either a Lexical
Sense, or a Lexical Entry).

 dbnary:targetLanguage is an object property
whose range is a dcterms:Linguistic-
System. All values are in the lexvo name-
space.9

 dbnary:writtenForm gives the written form of
the translation in the target language. We decided not to relate it to a vocable as some translations may not be definable as lexical entries
in the target language.

7The dbnary namespace used in this article resolves to http:

//kaiko.getalp.org/dbnary#

8Indeed, we could have simply defined the domain/range of lexical relations and translations as a owl:unionOf Lexical Entry and Lexical Sense.

9e.g. http://lexvo.org/id/iso639-3/deu represents the German lan-

guage

dataset.

Fig. 2. A subset of the translations related to the lexical entry eng:cat_Noun_1.

 dbnary:gloss is a string property that contains
all available information used to denote the lexical sense of the source of the translation (e.g.
in the English entry "cat", the German translation "Katze" appears in a box labelled with
the gloss "domestic species", used to denote the
fact that "Katze" is a translation of the Lexical
Sense defined by "A domesticated subspecies,
Felis silvestris catus, of feline animal...".10

 dbnary:usage is a string property that contains
all available information concerning this translation object. It usually gives additional information on the target entry.

10This means that, in an ideal situation, the translation should be
linked to this Lexical Sense, instead of the Lexical Entry, however,
such a linking may be error prone, hence, we decided to make such
refinements afterwards.

3.3. Structure of the extracted lexical data

Figure 1 illustrates the main elements characterizing
a lexicon entry in the DBnary data. Each Wiktionary
page is represented by a dbnary:Vocable element that
refers to its corresponding lemon:LexicalEntry. Each
lexical entry corresponds to one lemma, one etymology and one part of speech. Each lexical entry is related to its lemon:LexicalSense by the lemon:sense
property. A lexical sense corresponds to one definition.
Each lexical entry is related to its canonical form
and possibly to alternate forms (that are represented
using lemon:LexicalForms). The part of speech is available through the dbnary:partOfSpeech property that
gives the part of speech as defined by the Wiktionary
language edition, and through the isocat:partOfSpeech
property that points to a standard ISOcat part of speech
value.

Figure 2 illustrates the DBnary extension to LEMON
that is used to represent the numerous translations

available in Wiktionary. Each translation is represented
as a dbnary:Translation instance associated to a lexical
entry by the isTranslationOf property. The translation
is given as a string through the writtenForm property,
as some translations may not necessarily correspond to
vocables in the target language (e.g. explanatory trans-
lations). The target language of the translation is given
using the ISO 639-3 3-letter language code [7]. When
available, the gloss property value gives an indication
concerning the lexical sense that is translated. In the
current dataset, the translation is linked to a usually
ambiguous lexical entry and the gloss is kept for further attachment to the correct word sense.

Wiktionary contains many thesaurus relations (like
synonymy, antonymy, etc.) that are represented using
the above mentioned nymy properties which relate
a lexical entity with another lexical entity. In the current dataset, most of the property subjects are lexical entries. However, in the case of monosemous lexical entries, the synonymy relation is attached to the
unique lemon:LexicalSense. Figure 3 illustrates how
DBnary encodes nymy relations with examples of
the dbnary:synonym property. The upper part of the
figure shows an example of a dbnary:synonym property that is related to the ambiguous lexical entry
eng:cat__Noun__1. The lower part shows that, in the
monosemous lexical entry eng:voyager__Noun__1,
the dbnary:synonym property is related to the unique
lexical sense of the entry. The object of such properties
are always dbnary:Vocable.

These numbers are constantly evolving, as the original Wiktionary data is edited and as the extractor itself
is improved.11 Table 1 gives the size of the resources

tracted.12

tion initiatives like [12] (contained in UBY [5]) or

In order to guide the extractors definition and main-
tenance, we compare the extracted data with the count
of interwiki links13 (available through a Wiktionary

API). Table 3 gives an overview of such a compari-
son. Column # of transl. shows the number of extracted
translations and the ratio of extracted translations vs
interwiki links. As may be seen, the Greek extractor
only gets a 0.64 ratio of extracted translations vs interwiki links. This is an indication of the fact that this
extractor is in a very rough state. On the contrary, the
French extractor gets more translations than interwiki
links, as the French edition does not generate links
when the target language edition does not exist. Such
heuristics are not applicable to the Finnish and Russian editions as they do not use interwiki links for their
translations.

Finally, by comparing the evolution of extracted
data over time, we are able to detect when an editorial decision is made in a language edition that leads
to a loss of extracted data. That was the case when the
French language editors decided to change the names
of the macros used to represent a translation.

5. Conclusion and Perspectives

We have presented the DBnary dataset, a LEMONbased lexical network built from different Wiktionary
language editions. That work is interesting for many
users as it enables them to use the extracted data in
their own NLP systems. Moreover, as the extracted
resource uses the Resource Description Framework
(RDF) standard and the LEMON model, the extracted
data are also directly usable by researchers working on
the Semantic Web, where it could be used to ease the
ontology alignment systems when terms in different
languages are used to describe ontologies of a domain.
DBnary contains a significant number of entries for
at least English and French, which makes it com-

parable to Wordnet [2]. Moreover, it contains many
translations with certain language pairs that makes it
also comparable to the Open Multilingual Wordnet [1]
(an aggregation of several existing multilingual Word-
nets).

Our next objective is to better generalize the treatments of the current extractors, so that it will be easier
to create and maintain extractors for other languages.
We have recently introduced extractors for the Russian
and Greek languages, and are working on others. We
welcome all initiatives aiming at the addition of new
languages to this open-source tool.

We will also enhance the DBnary data by providing
more lexico-semantic relations and translations linked
on the lexical sense level.
