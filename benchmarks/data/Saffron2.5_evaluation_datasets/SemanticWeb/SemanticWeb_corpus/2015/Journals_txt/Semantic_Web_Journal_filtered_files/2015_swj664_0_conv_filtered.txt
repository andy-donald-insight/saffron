Abstract. We introduce lemonUby, a new lexical resource integrated in the Semantic Web which is the result of converting data
extracted from the existing large-scale linked lexical resource UBY to the lemon lexicon model. The following data from UBY
were converted: WordNet, FrameNet, VerbNet, English and German Wiktionary, the English and German entries of Omega-
Wiki, as well as links between pairs of these lexicons at the word sense level (links between VerbNet and FrameNet, VerbNet
and WordNet, WordNet and FrameNet, WordNet and Wiktionary, WordNet and German OmegaWiki). We linked lemonUby to
other lexical resources and linguistic terminology repositories in the Linguistic Linked Open Data cloud and outline possible
applications of this new dataset.

1. Introduction

Recently, the language resource community has begun
to explore the opportunities offered by the Semantic
Web, lead by the formation of the Linguistic Linked
Open Data (LLOD) cloud and an increasing interest in
making use of Linked Open Data principles in the context of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Linguistics [7]. The use of RDF supports data integration and offers a large body of tools for accessing this
data. Furthermore, the linked data approach gives rise

*Corresponding author, http://www.ukp.tu-darmstadt.de

to novel research questions in the context of language
resources and their application.

For lexical resources, data integration has been
in the focus of interest for many years, resulting in
numerous mappings and linkings of lexica, as well
as standards for representing lexical resources, such
as the ISO 24613:2008 Lexical Markup Framework
(LMF) [13]. In this context, the LLOD cloud can be
considered as a new data integration platform, enabling linkings not only between lexical resources, but
also between lexical resources and other language re-
sources.

We extend the LLOD cloud by a new lexical resource called lemonUby1 which is the result of converting data extracted from the existing large-scale
linked lexical resource UBY [14]2 to the lemon lexicon model. UBY has been developed independently
from Semantic Web technology. It is LMF based and
a subset of the LMF-compliant UBY lexicons is pairwise linked at the word sense level. The lemon lexicon
model has been developed for lexical resource integration on the Semantic Web [19]. This lexicon model
serves as a common interchange format for lexical resources on the Semantic Web and has been designed to
represent and share lexical resources that are linked to
ontologies, i.e., ontology lexica. Making use of a lexicon interchange format, such as lemon is not only important for data integration, but also for the reuse of
lexicons.

While many lexical resources have already been included in the LLOD cloud, e.g., [3,21,22,18,10], the
LLOD cloud is still missing a large-scale lexical resource rich in lexical information on verbs, including aspects such as syntactic behaviour and semantic
roles of a verbs arguments. Such information is crucial
for lexicalizing relational knowledge, e.g., the relation
like(Experiencer,T heme) can be lexicalized syntactically with a verb as in "NP likes NP".

The new resource lemonUby addresses this gap:
Along with resources for word-level semantics (Word-
Net [12], English and German Wiktionary,3 and the
English and German entries of OmegaWiki,4) we converted two syntactically rich resources from UBY to
the lemon format: FrameNet [2] and VerbNet [15]. For
further data integration, we established links between
lemonUby and other language resources in the LLOD
cloud.

2. Representing lexical-semantic resources as

Linked Data: lemon

There has been significant work towards integrating
lexical resources using RDF and Semantic Web principles [6], and many resources are already available
as Linked Data. Yet, representing lexical resources in
RDF does not per se make them semantically interop-
erable. Consider, for instance, existing conversions of

Fig. 1. The core of the lemon model

WordNet and FrameNet [27,24], where a simple mapping to RDF is provided, and augmented with OWL
semantics so that reasoning could be applied to the
structure of the resource. However, the formats chosen for the RDF versions of WordNet and FrameNet
are specific to the underlying data models of WordNet
and FrameNet. Although these lexicons are complementary resources [1], it is difficult (i) to link them in
this form on the Semantic Web, and (ii) to use them as
interchangeable modules in NLP applications.

In order to overcome this difficulty, the lemon model
[19] was proposed as a common interchange format for
lexical resources on the Semantic Web. lemon has its
historical roots in LMF and thus allows easy conversion from LMF-like, non-linked data resources. It links
to data categories in annotation terminology reposito-
ries, and most of all, it realises a separation of lexicon
and ontology layers, so that lemon lexica can be linked
to existing ontologies in the linked data cloud.

This core model is illustrated in Fig. 1, which defines the basic elements used by all lexica published as
linked data. In addition to this there are a number of
modules used to model linguistic description, syntax,
morphology and relationships between lexica.5

lemon has been used as a basis for integrating the
data of the English Wiktionary with the RDF version of WordNet [18]. lemons similarity to the WordNet model made this conversion straight-forward, with
only the need for a slight change in modelling to accommodate inflectional variants of lexical entries.

3. Large-scale integration of lexical-semantic

resources: UBY and UBY-LMF

UBY is both a network of interlinked lexical-semantic
resources and a project on continuous integration and
linking of lexical resources for NLP applications. It is
motivated by the observation that an essential requirement in NLP is the availability of a wide range of lexical resources that can be used for many different NLP
tasks. In a continuous process, such resources are integrated into UBY by means of (i) making them interoperable and (ii) linking them to other resources in UBY
at the sense level.

In UBY, interoperability is achieved by standardizing lexical resources according to UBY-LMF [8,9],
a lexicon model which is an instantiation of LMF,
specifically designed for NLP. The lexicon model
UBY-LMF has been developed to fully cover a wide
range of heterogeneous lexical resources without information loss, which resulted in a fine-grained model
of lexical information types (documented by data categories from ISOcat,6 the implementation of the ISO
12620:2009 Data Category Registry) and was accompanied by an extension of the ISO standard LMF by
a few elements. The extensibility of UBY-LMF was a
primary design principle in order to enable the integration of further (in particular automatically acquired)
lexical resources.

The mapping from UBY-LMF to lemon is motivated
by an increase in interoperability with the Semantic
Web and its resources, thereby making it available to
a new group of potential users and novel applications.
Beyond this, mapping UBY-LMF to lemon is an interesting task per se, because lemon links lexical resources and ontologies, whereas UBY-LMF is not related to any ontology. Another benefit is that LMF is
not an open standard (in the sense that its specification is not freely available), while lemon fully complies
with open data and open access principles.

4. Converting UBY lexica to lemon: lemonUby

To automatically convert data from UBY-LMF (ex-
tracted from UBY) to lemon, we performed a mapping
of UBY-LMF elements to lemon concepts and proper-
ties. This involves two aspects: Formalizing and mapping UBY data structures in a Semantic-Web compliant way, and the actual conversion of UBY data.

4.1. Modeling Data Categories: ubyCat

In UBY-LMF, most of the terms used and many features (e.g., the feature partOfSpeech and the corresponding attribute values) are linked to communitymaintained data categories in ISOcat.7 As the mapping
of UBY-LMF to lemon preserves this linking, lemonUby is linked to ISOcat as well. The content of ISOcat is
also available as Linked Data [28], and therefore, provides a possible and direct way to interconnect lemonUby with other LLOD resources at the level of linguistic data categories.

However, ISOcat is not a formal ontology, but only a
semistructured collection of terms, and while it serves
as a repository of definitions, it does not provide
a formal data model that can be applied to a re-
source: ISOcat contains doublets created by different data providers, and such superficially similar categories may actually have incompatible definitions,
e.g., gerundive [DC-1294] is an adjective formed
from a verb (excluding verbal nouns), whereas gerundive [DC-2243] is a non-finite form (...) other than
the infinitive (including verbal nouns). Hierarchical
relations between ISOcat terms are possible, but not
obligatory, and when compared with a full-fledged on-
tology, ISOcat terms that represent superconcepts for
a bundle of features do not distinguish relational and
categorial aspects.

To render UBY/ISOcat data categories in a formal
data model, we created the OWL/DL ontology ubyCat8 which defines the semantics of linguistic terms
used in lemonUby: With respect to data structures, it
extends the lemon ontology,9 concepts that are equivalent with lemon but have a different label are included,
flagged as deprecated (and not used during the conver-

sion), but left in the ontology to help UBY-LMF users
find the equivalent lemon categories.

With respect to data categories, ubyCat is linked
to the Ontologies of Linguistic Annotations (OLiA)
[4,5],10 a modular architecture of OWL/DL ontologies that link resource-specific linguistic terminology
(as for UBY) to an overarching Reference Model
which (a) provides a particular view on linguistic ter-
minology, and (b) serves as an interface to multiple
community-maintained terminology repositories such
as ISOcat with which it is linked. Details of this linking
are described in Sect. 5.1.

4.2. Converting the Data

The actual conversion of UBY data was achieved by
means of an XML style sheet transform11 that implements a mapping of the UBY-LMF model to the lemon
model.

The following data from UBY were converted:
WordNet, FrameNet, VerbNet, English and German
Wiktionary, the English and German entries of Ome-
gaWiki, as well as links between pairs of these lexicons at the word sense level:

 monolingual manual sense links for VerbNet
FrameNet,12 VerbNetWordNet,13 and automatic
sense links for WordNetFrameNet [25,16], and
WordNetWiktionary [23];

 cross-lingual automatic sense links between WordNet and German OmegaWiki [14], and manual
inter-language links already given in OmegaWiki.

The resulting resource lemonUby has been published at http://lemon-model.net/lexica/
uby under an open CC-BY-SA license. The choice of
a share-alike license was due to UBY being published
under the same license. Statistics for the lemonUby resources including the sense links within this dataset
are given in table 1. An obvious gap is the German
Wiktionary which is currently not linked to any other
resource within lemonUby. Future work on increasing
the link density within lemonUby should address this
gap.

projects/verbnet

The XML style sheet mapping between the two lexicon models UBY-LMF and lemon revealed a number
of differences between them. Most differences are due
to the fact that lemon is a model for ontology lexica
where the lexicon and ontology layers are kept sep-
arate. Thus, sense representations in lemon primarily
consist of references to the associated ontology where
a rich and domain-specific sense definition is provided.
UBY-LMF, on the other hand, represents fine-grained
sense information in the lexicon itself.

In line with previous authors [18], synsets in UBYLMF (provided in WordNet and OmegaWiki) are considered to be SKOS concepts and referenced like ontology classes in lemon. Hypernym relationships stated
in the lexicon are mapped directly to broader/narrower
relationships in the ontology.

The SemanticPredicate class in UBY-LMF is
used to represent semantic frames from FrameNet [9];
frames group senses which evoke the same kind of situation with participants taking over particular roles.
Thus, senses in a FrameNet frame are semantically
related, but not synonymous; e.g., the verbs love and
hate are both in the same FrameNet frame. In lemon
this relation is represented as subclass of the general
lexical sense and linked to the rest of the lexicon by a
broader (sense) relationship.

VerbNet verb classes and their hierarchical organization correspond to Subcat[egorization]FrameSet
in UBY-LMF. VerbNet classes group verbs that share
the same syntactic subcategorization frame, semantic
roles, selectional restrictions, and semantic predicate.
Although the resulting verb classes are semantically
coherent, the semantic relatedness of verb senses in a
VerbNet class is much more distant than in FrameNet,
e.g., the verbs believe, swear and doubt are in the
same class. Verb classes in lemon are represented by a
broader sense as well, so lemon collapses the distinction between FrameNet-style and VerbNet-style sense
groupings.

Translations to other human languages which are
encoded as string-valued lexical items in the Equivalent class are mapped as a datatype property on the
sense, in line with the UBY representation [17] rather
than attempting to construct a cross-lingual linking for
these terms as in the original resources (OmegaWi-
ki and Wiktionary). Finally, provenance information is
added to each resource at the root URL, including the
source resource and version, time of creation and a link
to the FOAF profile of the executor. Further examples

of usage and modelling are available from the web-
site.14

5. Linking lemonUby to language resources

We linked lemonUby to other related resources in the
LLOD cloud in order to make it accessible from existing datasets on the Semantic Web.

5.1. Linking ubyCat with repositories of linguistic

terminology

We linked the data categories in ubyCat with the OLiA
Reference Model, which provides formal definitions
of annotation schemes for various linguistic phenomena in about 70 languages as OWL/DL ontologies, and
which is further linked with other terminology repositories such as ISOcat and GOLD [11].

The ubyCat ontology plays an important role for the
linking of UBY data categories to OLiA, because it
defines grammatical concepts used in UBY-LMF in a
formal data model. The linking between ubyCat and
the OLiA Reference Model is implemented by subClassOf relationships between its concepts and the
Reference Model. In OLiA, this mechanism is generally applied to physically separate resource-specific,
interpretation-independent information (e.g., from an
annotation scheme, hence the term OLiA Annotation
Model) from resource-independent terminology (pro-
vided by the OLiA Reference Model) and its interpretation in terms of the latter (Linking Model).

The separation of interpretation and interpretationindependent information by means of a declarative
Linking Model15 is necessary for reasons of transparency and reversibility, because different interpretations and thus, different linkings may be possible. Any
interpretation requires to compare information provided by different communities (resource developer,
terminology maintainer), it may be affected by differences in point of view or terminological traditions familiar to the ontology engineer. With the linking contained within a separate file, it is actually possible to
provide alternative interpretations of the same Annotation Model.

14See, e.g., http://lemon-model.net/lexica/uby/
modelling.php or http://lemon-model.net/learn/
learn.php

15http://purl.org/olia/ubyCat-link.rdf

Another advantage of an ontological formalization
of linguistic terminology is that it is more expressive
than a plain hierarchy or list of terms. An example for
a complex linking is the verb form annotation ing-
Form, used for verb forms like talking in the resource.
This category represents a language-specific merger of
present participles (he is speaking, Old English -inde)
and gerunds (he began [the ] speaking, Old English -
inge). The linking provides a language-neutral definition as PresentParticiple or Gerund, so that categories
across different languages can be compared more eas-
ily.16

Through OLiA, grammatical information from lemonUby is interoperable with other LLOD resources
linked to either OLiA or any of the terminology repositories it is linked with, including GOLD and ISOcat.

5.2. Linking lemonUby to lexical resources

As UBY is derived from existing lexical resources, the
simplest links to create are those to other RDF versions of the resources that compose UBY. For Word-
Net, these links are simply created by mapping the data
of UBY, which uses WordNet 3.0, to the linked data
version of WordNet 3.0.17 Here, we provided links at
both the sense level and at the lexical entry level (lexi-
cal entries are words in WordNet 3.0). As can be ex-
pected, we found that this linking worked apart from 7
senses that did not map, which we believe is due to a
bug in the WordNet API.

In addition, we provided links at the lexical entry
level to two existing resources that are also widely
used, i.e., RDF WordNet 2.0 [27] and an RDF instantiation of Wiktionary.18 These links at the lexical entry
level are created if two entries share the same lemma
and part-of-speech information. We assume this linking is always correct given the lemma and part-of-
speech are correct in the original resource.

For the RDF WordNet 2.0, we created such a simple
linking at the lexical entry level, because a linking at
the sense level based on the sense identifiers is not possible due to different WordNet versions using different
sense identifiers.

16It should be noted that such a complex linking requires the use
of operators like and and or in the linking, to capture this informa-
tion, OLiA ontologies employ OWL/DL. The direct mapping between annotations and reference concepts originally advocated for
ISOcat and GOLD cannot represent this information.

17http://semanticweb.cs.vu.nl/lod/wn30/
18http://wiktionary.dbpedia.org

Eckle-Kohler et al. /

The linking of the Uby version of WordNet and the
RDF export of Wiktionary at the lexical entry level
is based on the assumption that corresponding word
classes share the same part-of-speech category in both
resources. While this is mostly true, we found a few
word classes where we had to manually unify diverging part-of-speech categories; these word classes were
initially not covered by the linking. For instance, for
acronyms (e.g. IBM), Wiktionary assigns Initialism
as a part-of-speech, whereas WordNet counts these as
nouns. Statistics for all mappings including the coverage of the linkings are given in table 2.

6. Applications of lemonUby

As a web resource, lemonUby provides two main possible applications: firstly as a resource to allow better
lexical description of ontology entities and secondly as
a resource for NLP applications.

As a wide coverage resource containing lexical in-
formation, it would be possible to link existing ontologies and terminology vocabularies to lemonUby and
then obtain rich information about the linguistic usage
of a given term. As an example, consider the crosslingual linking of verb senses across English and German available in lemonUby. Verb senses in the German OmegaWiki can be enriched by semantic role and
selectional preference information from VerbNet and
FrameNet via the cross-lingual linking between German OmegaWiki and WordNet, and via the WordNet
VerbNet and WordNetFrameNet linking. Currently,
no German lexica with these information types are
freely available for research purposes.

As a resource for NLP applications, lemonUby can
be easily deployed into existing applications [26]. The
wide variety of lexical information types it offers,
ranging from taxonomic relationships (e.g., hypon-
omy) and translations to fine-grained lexical-syntactic
information, makes it an attractive resource for many
different NLP tasks, such as Entity or Predicate Dis-
ambiguation, to name only two.

Recently, it has been shown that lemonUby is a valuable resource for machine translation [20]. By mining
translations from lemonUby and combining them with
the Moses statistical machine translation, the performance of the resulting machine translation system im-
proved.

Furthermore, all the data from lemonUby is available via a SPARQL endpoint.19 Thus, ad-hoc queries
can be used to access and explore the resource, for example to find translational equivalents quickly and eas-
ily.

7. Conclusion and Outlook

We presented lemonUby, a new linked data resource
which combines data from the standardized lexical resource UBY with the principled model, lemon, for representing lexical data on the web. This resource provides not only rich information about many lexical entries in two languages, it is also linked at the word
sense level both within its component resources and to
other language resources on the web.

We see two main directions for future research on
lemonUby: first, the further linking of this dataset both
within lemonUby and to other resources on the web,
and second, the use of lemonUby in RDF-based NLP
applications in order to gain a deeper understanding of
the added value of linked lexical resources for NLP.
