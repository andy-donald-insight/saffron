Abstract. In this paper we describe the Semantic Quran dataset, a multilingual RDF representation of translations of the Quran.
The dataset was created by integrating data from two different semi-structured sources and aligned to an ontology designed
to represent multilingual data from sources with a hierarchical structure. The resulting RDF data encompasses 43 different
languages which belong to the most under-represented languages in the Linked Data Cloud, including Arabic, Amharic and
Amazigh. We designed the dataset to be easily usable in natural-language processing applications with the goal of facilitating
the development of knowledge extraction tools for these languages. In particular, the Semantic Quran is compatible with the
Natural-Language Interchange Format and contains explicit morpho-syntactic information on the utilized terms. We present the
ontology devised for structuring the data. We also provide the transformation rules implemented in our extraction framework.
Finally, we detail the link creation process as well as possible usage scenarios for the Semantic Quran dataset.

1. Introduction

Over the last years, the Linked Open Data (LOD)
movement has gained significant momentum [1]. A
large number of datasets was extracted from sources
as different as Wikipedia infoboxes and curated biomedical databases. Still, most of the datasets in the
Linked Data Cloud contain only English labels and
fail to represent the diversity of languages used across
the Web.1 Yet, a more multilingual Linked Data Cloud
would represent a tremendous resource that can be
used for novel knowledge extraction techniques and
more broadly for novel natural-language processing (NLP) approaches. For example, novel NLP ap-

1From the 315 datasets analyzed by the LodStats framework
(http://stats.lod2.eu), 128 datasets provide English la-
bels. French, the second most popular language in the LOD Cloud,
is used in only 15 (approximately 4.8%) of the datasets. Most other
languages occur in at most one dataset.

proaches for minority languages could be developed
by reusing information available across the different
languages [6]. Moreover, a structured representation
of corpora would improve their use in applications
such as the specification of templates for question answering [7] or the efficient merging with other resources [3].

In this paper, we present

the Semantic Quran
dataset. The Semantic Quran dataset consists of all
chapters of the Quran in 43 different languages including rare languages such as Divehi, Amazigh and
Amharic. The data included in our dataset was extracted from two semi-structured sources: the Tanzil
project and the Quranic Arabic Corpus (cf. section 4).
We designed an ontology for representing this multilingual data and their position in the Quran (i.e.,
numbered chapters and verses). In addition to providing aligned translations for each verse, we provide
morpho-syntactic information on each of the original

Arabic terms utilized across the dataset. Moreover, we
linked the dataset to three versions of Wiktionary as
well as DBpedia and ensured therewith that our dataset
abides by all Linked Data principles2.

In the following, we present the data sources that we
used for the extraction (section 2). Thereafter, we give
an overview of the ontology that underlies our dataset
(section 3). Section 4 depicts the extraction process
that led to the population of our ontology. We present
our approach to interlinking the Semantic Quran and
Wiktionary in section 5. Finally, we present several usage scenarios for the dataset at hand (section 6).

2. Data Sources

Two web resources were used as raw data sources
for our dataset. The first web resource is the data generated by the Tanzil Project3, which consists of the
original verses in Arabic as well as 42 manual translations of the entire book. Our second web resource, the
Quranic Arabic Corpus4, was used to obtain morphosyntactic information on each of the words contained
in the Arabic version of the Quran.

2.1. Tanzil Project

The Tanzil Project5 was motivated by inconsistencies across the different digital versions of the Quran.
These were mainly due to missing/incorrect diacritics,
Arabic text conversion problems, and missing encoding for some Arabic characters.

Tanzil was launched in early 2007 with the aim
of producing a curated unicode version of the Arabic Quran text that can serve as a reliable standard
text source on the web. To achieve this goal, then
Tanzil team developed a three-step data quality assurance pipeline which consists of (1) an automatic text
extraction of the Arabic text, (2) a rule-based verification of the extraction results and (3) a final manual
verification by a group of experts.

The result of this process was a set of datasets that
were made available in several versions and formats.6
In addition to the original Arabic sources, Tanzil pro-

vides sentence-parallel translations of the Quran in 42
different languages by different translators7. We manually selected one translation per language for the extraction process.8 Note that all Tanzil datasets are distributed under the terms of Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License.9

2.2. The Quranic Arabic Corpus Project

The Quranic Arabic Corpus is an open-source
project, which provides Arabic annotated linguistic resources which shows the Arabic grammar, syntax and
morphology for each word in the Quran. This is a
valuable resources for the development of NLP tools
for the Arabic language, in which a single word can
encompass the semantics of entire English sentences.
For instance the Arabic word fajaaln ahum can be
translated into the entire English sentence and we
made them. The compact syntax of Arabic leads to
that a single word being separable into distinct morphological segments. For example, fajaaln ahum
can be subdivided into:

 fa  a prefixed conjunction (engl. "and"),
 jaal  the stem, a perfect past tense verb (engl.
"made") inflected as first person masculine plural,
 n a  a suffixed subject pronoun (engl. "we") and
 hum  a suffixed object pronoun (engl. "them").

A Resource Description Framework (RDF) and Natural Language Processing Interchange Format (NIF)[4]
representation of this rich morphology promises to further the development of integrated NLP pipelines for
processing Arabic. In addition, given that this corpus
was curated manually by experts, it promises to improve the evaluation of integrated NLP frameworks.
We thus decided to integrate this data with the translation data available in the Tanzil datasets. Here, we used
the Quranic Arabic Corpus Version 0.410 in its delimited text file version under the GNU General Public
License.11

3. Ontology

To represent

the data as RDF, we developed a
general-purpose linguistic vocabulary. The vocabulary12 was specified with the aim of supporting
datasets which display a hierarchical structure. It includes four basic classes: Chapter, Verse, Word and
LexicalItem.

The Chapter class provides the name of chapters
in different languages and localization data such as
chapter index and order. Additionally, the chapter class
provides metadata such as the number of verses in
a chapter and provenance information. Finally, the
chapter class provides properties that allow referencing the verses it contains. For example each chapter
provides a dcterms:tableOfContents for each
of its verses in the form qrn:quran<chapter>-
<verse>.

The Verse class contains the verse text in different
languages as well as numerous localization data such
as verse index and related chapter index. Additionally,
this class provides related verse data such as different verse descriptions and provenance information. Fi-
nally, it contains referencing properties similar to those
of chapters.

The Word class encompasses the next level of granularity and contains the words in the verse text in different languages as well as numerous localization data
such as related verse and chapter verse indexes. Addi-
tionally, the word class provides word provenance information and some referencing properties.

Currently, the LexicalItem class provides morphological data on the Arabic words only. Several ontologies can be used to represent such information. In our
dataset, we relied on the RDF representation of the
GOLD linguistic ontology13 [2] to provide linguistic
properties of lexical items such as acoustic, root, part
of speech, gender, number, and person. We chose to
use GOLD in contrast to other ontologies because it
belongs to the most exhaustive ontologies for modeling linguistic properties. Thus, it will allow us to easily
extend this dataset in future work. All the objects of
the previously mentioned properties are URIs from the
OLIA Arabic Linguistic ontology14 . Analogously to
the other classes, LexicalItem provides provenance information and referencing properties. A UML class di-

agram of the four basic ontology classes of the Semantic Quran Dataset with inter-class internal relations is
shown in Figure 1.

4. Extraction Process

The original Tanzil Arabic Quran data and translations are published in various formats. For the sake of
effectiveness, delimited text files were selected as the
basis for the RDF extraction. The format of the delimited file is chapterIndex|verse|verseText.
For example, the first verse of the first chapter of
the English translation of the Quran is 1|1|In the
Name of Allah, the Most Beneficent, the
Most Merciful. On the other hand, the Quranic
Arabic corpus is available as tab-separated text file of
the form LOCATION FORM TAG FEATURES:

 The LOCATION field consists of 4-part numbering scheme of the form (Chapter : Verse : Word
: Segment). For example, the first segment of the
first word of the first verse of the first chapter has
the form (1:1:1:1).

 The FORM field contains the text of the current
segment in the Extended Buckwalter translitera-
tion15. For example the corresponding FORM to
(1:1:1:1) is bi (engl. "In").

 The TAG field contains the part-of-speech tag for
the current segment. For example the corresponding TAG to (1:1:1:1) is p which stands for
preposition.

 The FEATURES field contains a complete morphological analysis of the current segment such
as root, case and person-number-gender proper-
ties. For example the corresponding FEATURES
to (1:1:1:1) is PREFIX|bi+ which stands
for preposition prefix ("by", "with", "in") with
acoustic property bi.

Given the regular syntax used in the text file corpus at hand, we were able to carry out a one-to-one
mapping of each fragment of the input text file to re-
sources, properties or data types as explicated in the
ontology shown in Figure 1. We relied on the Apache
Jena Framework16 for the conversion. The part-of-

speech information and morphological characteristics
of each segment of the Arabic Quranic Corpus were
extracted and integrated with the words found in the
Tanzil dataset. The merged data is now available in the
RDF format. In order to simplify the interoperability
of the generated dataset, we followed the specifications
of the NIF. Currently, the original Arabic and four different translations of the Quran (Arabic, English, Ger-
man, French and Russian) abide by the NIF formal-
ization. Details of the Semantic Quran dataset CKAN
entry, its SPARQL endpoint, version and license are
listed in Table 1.

We aimed to link our dataset with as many data
sources as possible to ensure maximal reusability and
integrability in existing platforms. We have generated
links to 3 versions of the RDF representation of Wiktionary as well as to DBpedia. All links were generated

by using the LIMES framework [5]. The link specification used was essentially governed by fragments
similar to that shown in Listing 1. The basic intuition
behind this specification is to link words that are in a
given language in our dataset to words in the same lan-

links to the English version of DBpedia, which in turn
is linked to non-English versions of DBpedia. In addi-
tion, we generated 7809 links to the English, 9856 to
the French and 1453 to the German Wiktionary. Links
to further versions of DBpedia and Wiktionary will be
added in the future.

Listing 1: Fragment of the link specification to the
English Wiktionary.

We evaluated the quality of the links generated by
manually checking 100 randomly selected links from
each of the three languages. The manual check was
carried out by the two authors. A link was set to be correct if both authors agreed on it being correct. Overall,
the linking achieve a precision of 100% for the English
version, 96% for the French and 87% for the German.
The error in the French links were due homonymy
errors. For example, Est (engl. East) was linked to
est (engl. to be) in some cases. Similarly in the Ger-
man, Stutze (engl. support) was linked to stutze
(engl. imperative singular form the verb to support).
In the next version of the dataset, we will add contextbased disambiguation techniques to improve the quality of the links. Especially, we will consider the type
of the expression to link while carrying out the linking to ensure that verbs cannot be matched with nouns
for example. Still, the accuracies we achieve in these
three languages are sufficient to make the dataset useful for NLP applications. The recall could not be computed manually. While these values are satisfactory,
they can be improved further by devising a disam-

biguation scheme based on the context within which
the words occured. To achieve this goal, we aim to
combine the results of LIMES with the AGDISTIS disambiguation framework17 in future work.

6. Use Cases

The availability of a multilingual parallel corpus in
RDF promises to facilitate a large number of NLP ap-
plications. In this section, we outline selected application scenarios and use cases for our dataset.
Data Retrieval. The Quran contains a significant
number of instances of places, people and events.
Thus, multilingual sentences concerning such information can be easily retrieved from our dataset, for example for the purpose of training NLP tools. Moreover,
the aligned multilingual representation allows searching for the same entity across different languages. For
example, Listing 2 shows a SPARQL query which allows retrieving Arabic, English and German translations of verses which contain Moses.

SELECT DISTINCT ?chapterIndex ?verseIndex

?verseTextAr ?verseTextEn ?verseTextGr

WHERE{

?word rdfs:label "Moses"@en;

dcterms:isPartOf ?verse.

?verse a qvoc:Verse;

skos:prefLabel ?verseTextAr;
qvoc:verseIndex ?verseIndex;
dcterms:isPartOf ?chapter;
rdfs:label ?verseTextEn;
rdfs:label ?verseTextGr.

FILTER ( lang(?verseTextEn) = "en" &&

lang(?verseTextGr) = "de")

?chapter qvoc:chapterIndex ?chapterIndex.

Listing 2: Verses that contains moses in (i) Arabic (ii)
English and (iii) German.

Arabic Linguistics. The RDF representation of Arabic morphology and syntax promises to facilitate the
retrieval of relevant sub-corpora for researchers in lin-
guistics. For example, Listing 3 provides an example
of a SPARQL query witch retrieves all Arabic prepositions as well as an example statement for each of them.

SELECT ?preposition

( sql:SAMPLE ( ?verseTextAr ) AS ?example )

WHERE{

?s gold:PartOfSpeechProperty olia-ar:Preposition;

skos:prefLabel ?preposition;

dcterms:isPartOf ?verse.

?verse a qvoc:Verse;

skos:prefLabel ?verseTextAr.

}GROUP BY ?preposition

Listing 3: List all the Arabic prepositions with example
statement for each.

Another example is provided by Listing 4, which
shows a list of different part-of-speech variations of
one Arabic root of the word read "ktb" (engl. "write");
note that in this example we use the Arabic root "ktb"
witten in The Buckwalter transliteration.

SELECT DISTINCT ?wordText ?pos
WHERE{

?wordPart a qvoc:LexicalItem ;

gold:Root "ktb";
gold:PartOfSpeechProperty ?pos;
dcterms:isPartOf ?word.

?word a qvoc:Word;

skos:prefLabel ?wordText.

Listing 4: List of different part of speech variations of
one Arabic root of the word read "ktb".

Interoperability using NIF. Using the interoperability capabilities provided by NIF, it is easy to query all
occurrences of a certain text segment without using the
verse, chapter, word, or lexical item indexes. For in-
stance, Listing 5 lists all the occurrences of Moses
with no need to have an extra index.

SELECT ?textSegment ?verseText {

?s str:occursIn ?verse;

str:isString ?verseText.

?textSegment str:referenceContext ?s;
str:anchorOf "Moses"@de.

Listing 5: List of all occurrences of Moses using NIF

Information Aggregation. The interlinking of the
Quran dataset with other RDF data sources provides
a considerable amount of added value to the dataset.
For example, the interlinking with Wiktionary can be
used as in Listing 6 to get the different senses for each
of the English words contained in the first verse of the
first chapter qrn:quran1-1.

SELECT DISTINCT ?wordTextEn ?sense
FROM <http://thedatahub.org/dataset/semanticquran>
FROM <http://en.wiktionary.dbpedia.org>
WHERE{

?word a qvoc:Word;

rdfs:label ?wordTextEn;

dcterms:language lexvo:eng ;
dcterms:isPartOf qrn:quran1-1;
owl:sameAs ?wiktionaryWord.

FILTER ( lang(?wordTextEn) = "en" )
?wiktionaryWord lemon:sense ?sense

Listing 6: List of all senses of all English words of the
first verse of the first chapter "qrn:quran1-1".

7. Conclusion and Future Work

In this work, we presented the Semantic Quran, an
integrated parallel RDF dataset in 42 languages. This
multilingual dataset aims to increase the availability
of multilingual data in LOD and to further the development of NLP tools for languages that are still under represented, if not absent, from the LOD cloud.
Thanks to its RDF representation, our dataset ensures a
high degree of interoperability with other datasets. For
example, it provides 26735 links overall to Wiktionary
and DBpedia. As demonstrated by our use cases, the
dataset and the links it contains promise to facilitate
research on multilingual applications. Moreover, the
availability of such a large number of languages in the
dataset provides opportunities for linking across the
monolingual datasets on the LOD Cloud and thus perform various types of large-scale analyses.

To improve the ease of access to our dataset, we aim
to extend the TBSL framework [7] to allow even lay
users to gather sensible information from the dataset.
Moreover, we aim to provide links to the upcoming
versions of Wiktionary. Additionally, we will link the
Semantic Quran dataset with many of the publicly
available multilingual Wordnets. We already provided
NIF for the five languages Arabic, English, French,
German and Russian. We will extend the NIF content
of the dataset to the remaining 38 languages.
