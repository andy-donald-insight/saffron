Abstract. The Urbanopoly datasets contain the results of a data curation campaign on available geospatial open datasets like
OpenStreetMap. The curation effort is conducted through a location-based Game with a Purpose inspired by the monopoly board
game. The paper describes the generated datasets: we illustrate the genesis and life-cycle of Urbanopoly data; we explain the
modelling choices by introducing the provenance-based Human Computation ontology and by giving examples of the datasets
content; we describe the datasets publication on the Web as Linked Data and the cross-links to the curated datasets; finally, we
indicate the envisioned uses of the datasets as well as their possible re-uses.

1. Introduction

Wiki-like and collaborative approaches to collect
geospatial information are on the rise, as testified by
the popularity of Volunteered Geographic Information
(VGI) [10] initiatives. The most celebrated example is
OpenStreetMap1, the free editable map of the world.

Additionally, geospatial datasets are increasingly
present in government open data portal and in the
Linked Data Cloud; notable examples are LinkedGeoData [19]  the linked data version of OpenStreetMap
 and GeoLinkedData.es [20]  the Spanish initiative on geospatial linked data. Also ontologies and
vocabularies like NeoGeo [18] and query languages
like GeoSPARQL [17] are attracting a growing interest
from the Semantic Web community.

1Cf. http://www.openstreetmap.org/.

In both cases of official government datasets and
of collaboratively-collected information, geospatial
datasets are not necessarily trustworthy and change
over time. Thus, a data curation approach is required,
on the one hand, for quality assurance and, on the other
hand, to correct and update the dataset, in order to take
data dynamics into account.

In this paper, we present the linked datasets resulting from a Human Computation-based data curation
approach over pre-existing geospatial datasets. Data
management tasks are embedded in a location-based
Game with a Purpose that exploits players physical
presence in the environment. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 explains the
Urbanopoly game and its data curation workflow at
high level; Sections 35 detail the first three steps of
the workflow, also discussing modelling choices and
presenting explanatory examples; the publication, uses
and possible re-uses of the described datasets are ex-

plained in Section 6, as final step of the Urbanopoly
data curation workflow; finally, Section 7 concludes
the paper with some foresights.

2. Data Curation Workflow of Urbanopoly

Human Computation [15] is the paradigm to leverage human capabilities to solve tasks that computers
are not yet able to properly undertake. It is often used
to address the quality assurance problem and Games
with a Purpose (GWAP) [21] are employed to provide
an entertaining incentive to the task solution. To be ef-
fective, a GWAP should be carefully designed (a) to
provide an effective mechanism to address the Human
Computation task and (b) to assure a continuous involvement and contribution of users/players.

Our research investigation is oriented to discover if
the physical presence in the urban environment, together with location-based technologies, can provide
a valuable contribution to Human Computation tasks
related to geospatial information. While traditional
Human Computation approaches exploit users background knowledge or domain expertise, we argue that
the direct experience and human sensing can play
an important role in solving tasks related to the physical space. Thus, we built Urbanopoly, a mobile and
location-based GWAP whose purpose is quality assurance on geospatial (linked) data by exploiting a social
sensing approach via Human Computation.

From the gameplay point of view, Urbanopoly [6]
is inspired by the monopoly board game2. Taking as
input open geospatial datasets, Urbanopoly challenges
its players to play mini-games in the form of ques-
tions, quizzes or quests in order to conquer venues
and become a rich landlord. An aggregation algorithm combines players actions to consolidate up-to-
date and reliable information. The gameplay and the
competition with friends, on the other hand, provide
the long-term incentive for players.

The workflow of the Urbanopoly game is sketched
in Figure 1. Geospatial data describing urban points of
interest (POIs) are taken from open datasets as starting point for the game. Players play Urbanopoly and,
in order to be successful in the game, they face different mini-games: some challenges are aimed at
validating the existing data from the original sources,
other challenges require them to contribute new data.

Fig. 1. High level view of the workflow of the Urbanopoly game.

All players contributions are collected and a GWAP
approach is adopted to consolidate the different evidences by applying an aggregation algorithm. Finally,
consolidated information is published together with
provenance metadata as Linked Data [12], properly
linked to the original datasets; those links allow for
the extension and correction of those open geospatial
sources with new or improved data.

Each step of the workflow illustrated in Figure 1 is
explained in the following sections in terms of used or
generated datasets.

3. Step 1: Geospatial Input Datasets

As in the monopoly board game, the player is a landlord whose aim is to create a rich portfolio of venues;
Urbanopoly venues are real POIs in the surrounding
of the player, like shops, restaurants, monuments, etc.
This section describes the input datasets employed to
create the games venues.

3.1. Original data sources

The initial information about the venues is taken
from available open geospatial data sources: a wellknown VGI collaborative wiki effort  OpenStreetMap
 and, for what regards the area around the city of Mi-
lano, the Open Data Portal3 of Regione Lombardia, the
local regional public authority. In the initial dataset,
geographic coordinates of venues are considered sta-
ble; all other properties of venues are collected or validated through the game.

Data from OpenStreetMap can be obtained through
LinkedGeoData [19], the linked data version of this
VGI dataset. We selected a set of classes representing
POIs and, for each class, a number of properties to de-

scribe venues features. Similarly, we retrieved from
Lombardia Open Data Portal the information about
agriturismo venues, quite popular in Italy. That kind
of venues is not fully covered in OpenStreetMap, thus
this open data source was a very nice addition to the
initial dataset.

We initially included 36,897 venues from Lombardia in Italy, then we added 6,749 venues from the Amsterdam area; finally, we included also 7,817 venues
from Boston for a total of more than 50,000 venues.

3.2. Modelling of venues categories, features and

values

Since OpenStreetMap includes a very large and heterogeneous set of geospatial entities, we chose only a
subset of the available data. We selected a restricted
collection of 82 venues categories  like shops, mon-
uments, public transportation stops, etc. , picking
those that we considered meaningful for the game play
(i.e., worth of a monopoly-like conquer). Those categories are included in the Urbanopoly ontology, at
http://swa.cefriel.it/ontologies/urbanopoly.

Each Urbanopoly category is linked both to the respective LinkedGeoData class(es) and to the key-value
pair(s) used in OpenStreetMap to describe it. An example is given in Listing 1; since in most cases there
is no one-to-one mapping between Urbanopoly categories and the original OpenStreetMap or LinkedGeoData sources, we preferred to re-define those categories in our data model4.

Listing 1 Modelling of venues categories in Urbanopoly.

For each category we selected a number of features
that Urbanopoly players can provide in the game: apart

from name, category and basic address information 
which are common features for all venues  restaurants
are described by the cuisine type, bus stops by the line
numbers, banks by the availability of an ATM, etc.

To select the set of features of Urbanopoly, we
adopted a mixed approach: after an automatic selection of the most frequent keys used in OpenStreetMap
to describe the chosen venues categories5, we handpicked those that we considered meaningful for the
game (i.e., those that can be provided by a player physically close to the venue while playing the game). In
total, we modelled 107 features; on average each category has 11 features, with a minimum of 6 (corre-
sponding to naming and addressing information) and
a maximum of 16. Listing 2 presents a sample feature
definition.

Listing 2 Modelling of features in Urbanopoly.

Finally, since Urbanopoly is a mobile game and
players are expected to play on the move, we had the
need to minimize the effort required to enter features
values when playing the game (cf. also Section 4).
Therefore, we decided to provide  whenever possible
 pre-defined values for the selected features. Some
features can assume a closed set of values, while some
others have an extensible range of values; to address
this difference, we defined closed and semi-closed
datatypes to be used as features ranges. Listing 3 illustrate the case of yes/no values (a closed datatype).
The player is always given the possibility to type in a
custom value in case of semi-closed datatypes.

This features values definition was the most challenging part of the modelling, since not only values
depend on the feature, but they also change with respect to different places. For example, the bank operator feature  which indicates the name of the fi-

is possible to find them world-wide (e.g. Barclays),
while some others are national or even regional, thus
it would be better to suggest their name only to the
Urbanopoly players in the specific area. To solve this
issue, we created location-specific (at country level)
semi-closed datatypes that include pre-defined lists of
possible values; those values were derived from the
most frequently used values in the location-specific
dump of OpenStreetMap.

3.3. Representation and cross-linking of venues data

Each venue in Urbanopoly is given a URI identifier
with a namespace in our Web domain (http://swa.
cefriel.it/linkeddata/urbanopoly/), so to ease
the publication of Urbanopoly results as linked data
(cf. Section 6). For what regards the data from Open-
StreetMap/LinkedGeoData, we preserved the connection back to the original sources in the form of RDF
links. More specifically, we created owl:sameAs relations to LinkedGeoData URIs and rdfs:seeAlso
links to OpenStreetMap URLs (since OpenStreetMap
identifiers relate to Web pages rather than to the POIs
described on those pages), as shown in Listing 4.

4. Step 2: Urbanopoly Game Dataset

Urbanopoly users can launch the mobile app at any
time and then are allowed to play with the close-by
venues, as detected by the positioning service of the
mobile device. The aim of the Urbanopoly mini-games
is to gather a high-quality set of triples in the form:

<venue> <feature> <value> .

in which the feature is the property and the value is its
filler w.r.t. the venue.

During the gameplay, each player has to face the
data-centred challenges (shown in Figure 2). Data acquisition mini-games are useful when a value is miss-
ing; they require the player to insert a value or to pick
a pre-defined option from a drop-down list. Data validation mini-games are useful to confirm or confute
a previously-inserted value; in this case, players are
required to select a value from a closed list (among
which the value to be checked is inserted); from the
players point of view there is no great difference
between acquisition/validation mini-games; it is the
players response that is treated in different ways by
the Human Computation algorithm (cf. Section 5.1).

For each solved mini-game,

the players device
sends back the outcome to the Urbanopoly server, that
stores the contributions, described according to the ontology introduced hereafter.

4.1. PROV-O and the Human Computation ontology

For the last years, the Semantic Web community has
been working on the issue of provenance capture based
on knowledge representation. In 2009, the W3C set up
a Provenance Incubator Group, whose activity resulted
in its final report [9]; given the promising results, that
activity was turned in 2011 into an official W3C Working Group, which is standardising the PROV specification for provenance on the Web [1].

The PROV model is based on three main con-
cepts, entity, activity and agent, and their relations (cf.
Figure 3). The Provenance Ontology (PROV-O [2])
provides an ontological formalization of PROV in
OWL [13].

We modelled a specialization of PROV-O, available at http://swa.cefriel.it/ontologies/hc, that
is specifically intended as the ontological formalization of provenance in relation to a Human Computation approach [15]. To our best knowledge, this is
the first attempt to model a Human Computation on-
tology. We chose to model it by extending PROV-

task. For those reasons, we found PROV-O more appropriate for our modelling needs.

Figure 4 illustrates the main concepts and predicates
of our Human Computation ontology. The relevant entities are contributions  the outputs of human workers
 and consolidated information  the result of the aggregation algorithm. The respective activities are Human Computation tasks  solved by the contributor
agents  and the Human Computation algorithm that
consolidates the information contributed by the human
participants.

O, because Human Computation approaches need to
trace the provenance of the entities produced by the
respective involved agents. This ontology can be
reused to describe any Human Computation effort, because it is not specific to our Urbanopoly game.

In the domain of data curation, probably the most
popular ontology is the Data Quality Management
Vocabulary (DQM [8]), that is aimed to represent
data requirements, data quality assessment results,
data cleansing rules, and data requirement violations
connected to their origin; its application scope is
data quality monitoring, data quality assessment, and
data cleansing6. By addressing mainly automatic approaches to detect and correct data quality issues,
DQM was not suitable to model our Human Computation scenario: it would be of course possible to extend DQM to include human-based data quality rules,
but the DQM vocabulary do not (currently) include the
modelling of the agent involved in the data quality

OWL [13]).

4.2. Examples of Urbanopoly Game data

Every time Urbanopoly players solve a mini-game,
their contribution is recorded. A contribution is modelled by using Contribution, Contributor and Human
Computation Task concepts and their predicates, as illustrated in Listing 5 (identifiers are forged to make the
example readable). The example shows a contribution,
its link to the player/contributor and the task/mini-
game in which it was generated, the timestamp and the
actual piece of geospatial information provided by that
player.

Listing 5 Example of Urbanopoly contribution.

Since the collected data are a players contribution
and the player could be wrong or could cheat, we
cannot directly assert the specific geospatial statement
(i.e., the name of the venue); thus  at this stage  we
make use of RDF reification [16] to express the actual
content of the contribution.

5. Step 3: Human Computation and Geospatial

Output Datasets

Recording players activity is not the only task for
Urbanopoly. On the contrary, on the basis of the ini-

tial information (e.g., the original data from Open-
StreetMap) and the contributions received during the
gameplay, Urbanopoly assesses what the correct
piece of information is, by applying a Human Computation aggregation algorithm on the collected data.

In this section we illustrate the generation of the
main output datasets: the Human Computation information (that complements what illustrated in Section 4) and the consolidated geospatial information.

5.1. Aggregation algorithm

Human Computation approaches adopt an algorithm
 usually named aggregation algorithm [15]  to decide when and how to combine the contributions from
the human workers. Algorithms can be as simple as
majority voting or as complex as an intricate method
that keeps into account a wide set of parameters.

Urbanopoly applies its aggregation algorithm [4] to
consolidate the contributions coming from different
players; similarly to [3], Urbanopolys algorithm harmonizes and combines contributions through a scoring
function based on different elements: difficulty to provide the piece of data, players reputation and distance
to the venue at contribution time.

When there are at least two evidences (two contributions from two different players or the original source
information and a players contribution) and when the
computed score overcomes a threshold, the piece of
data is considered correct and can be published as
consolidated information, again according to the Human Computation ontology, as explained below.

5.2. Examples of Human Computation output data

When Urbanopoly applies its aggregation algo-
rithm, it evaluates the received contributions (cf. Listing 5) and produces the consolidated information,
which is again represented by using our Human Computation ontology (cf. right part of Figure 4).

An example of consolidated information is illustrated in Listing 6: the aggregation is triggered by
the contributions of two different players (Mario and
Luigi) and the resulting information is annotated with
a timestamp and a confidence score, that represents the
result of the scoring function.

Again, the actual content of the consolidated information is represented via RDF reification, because
until the confidence value overcomes a threshold the
venue-feature-value statement cannot be asserted.

the Human Computation output dataset is available online at http://bit.ly/prov-ex2.

5.3. Examples of Geospatial output data

As explained in the introduction, the main purpose of Urbanopoly is data curation over pre-existing
geospatial data sources. Therefore, the most important output dataset of Urbanopoly is the set of curated
geospatial information.

Whenever the confidence score overcomes a reliability threshold, the consolidated information is considered correct by Urbanopoly. The venue-feature-
value statement can thus be explicitly asserted, instead
of being reported only through reification, as shown in
Listing 7.

As a consequence, the full information that Urbanopoly knows about the venue includes both the

5.4. Evaluation of the aggregation algorithm

To assess the quality of the resulting geospatial
dataset and, thus, of the Urbanopoly data curation ap-
proach, we conducted an evaluation campaign [7].
With regards to the precision of the consolidated data,
we manually checked the correctness of the output of
the aggregation algorithm, one month after the release
of the game on Google Play; we restricted this manual
check to those venues that either we knew very well or
that we could physically go to and control. The computed accuracy is around 92%, which appears to be a
very good result. To measure the engagement potential of the game, we considered a typical Game with a
Purpose metrics, the Average Life Play (ALP [3], computed as ratio between the total played time and the
number of active users). Urbanopoly ALP is around
100 minutes, which means that players enjoyed the
game very much and returned several times to play the
game.

6. Step 4: Publication, use and re-use of Output

Datasets

The geospatial and Human Computation output
datasets are published on the Web according to the
Linked Data principles [12] as 5-star open data. Besides the machine-accessible data, we also provide a
human-friendly data navigation with Pubby7, browsable from http://swa.cefriel.it/linkeddata/.

Those datasets are released under an open data li-
cense, specifically under the Open Data Commons
Open Database License (ODbL8). This license respects the original sources  both OpenStreetMap/
LinkedGeoData and open data from Lombardy region
 and allows for the integration of Urbanopoly results
back to those datasets (cf. Section 6.2).

To decouple data processing from data access and
to avoid unnecessary or undesired interference with
the game, Urbanopoly updates the published linked
data periodically. There is no other specific versioning
mechanism in place because, since all Human Computation data are time-stamped, the output data can be
generated by (re)applying the aggregation algorithm to
(a subset of) the collected contributions.

6.1. Statistics

At the time of writing, Urbanopoly collected 17,139
contributions from 182 active players and about 1,208
distinct venues (thus, more than 14 contributions per
venue). The aggregation algorithm produced 2,351
consolidated statements (venue-feature-value triples),
related to 634 distinct venues (thus, 52.5% of played
venues, with an average of nearly 4 statements per
venue). In total, the Human Computation dataset (con-
tributions and consolidation) together with the geospatial output dataset contains about 280,000 triples.

Analysing the geospatial output dataset, other interesting facts can also be observed. The consolidated
statements make use of 64 different features as triple
predicates, out of the 107 features in our ontology
(nearly 60%). The most frequent features are the venue
name (27.7%), the venue category (12.9%), the
denomination of the street where the venue is located
(12.5%) and the transport type, i.e. the typology of
public transport means that pass by a stop (e.g., bus,
tram, subway; 4.5%). The frequency of those features
indicates also that those are the easiest and least con-

7Cf. https://github.com/cygri/pubby.
8Cf. http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/.

troversial data to collect: if a statement is consolidated,
it means that (a) multiple players provided that contribution and (b) different players agreed on its meaning.
Further evaluation details are included in the report [5]
related to the results of the first two months after the
Urbanopoly app release.

6.2. Re-use of the Geospatial Dataset

Since Urbanopoly is conceived as a data curation
Game with a Purpose, its geospatial output dataset
should be used to update and improve the accuracy of
the original datasets it refers to. The cross-links to both
OpenStreetMap and LinkedGeoData (cf. Listing 4) are
included to ease this process.

The additional or modified data as consolidated
by Urbanopoly can be sent back to OpenStreetMap,
thanks also to the references to the keys and keyvalue pairs used in OpenStreetMap, as shown in Section 3.2. Thus, if Urbanopoly outputs a statement saying that a venue has the category uo:Museum, this information can be added back to OpenStreetMap with
the tourism=museum key-value pair (cf. Listing 1);
similarly, if Urbanopoly generates the information that
a bank venue offers an ATM facility, that venue on
OpenStreetMap can be enriched with the atm=yes
key-value pair (cf. Listing 2).

While at this stage we do not have an automatic
feedback mechanism to the original sources, it would
not be difficult to implement it as described above.
Contributing back to OpenStreetMap would be indeed
meaningful to improve the accuracy of this dataset;
our early evaluation [5] showed that, even if OpenStreetMap data is already of good quality, Urbanopoly
is helpful because either it provides previously-missing
details or it reflects data dynamics (e.g. a shop changing trade name).

6.3. Use of the Human Computation dataset

Since data are expressed in RDF with respect to
an OWL ontology, it is possible to compute analysis
and statistics by running SPARQL [11] (and possibly
GeoSPARQL [17]) queries. For example, it is possible to express queries like: the most active contributors
or the contributors whose inputs lead to the greatest
amount of consolidated data; the information elements
confirmed by the highest number of users or consolidated more recently; the locations from which users
provide the highest number of contributions. Listing 9
presents some sample queries.

# top 3 most active contributors
PREFIX hc: <http://swa.cefriel.it/ontologies/hc#>
SELECT ?c
WHERE {

?c a hc:Contributor .
?x a hc:Contribution ;

hc:aggregatedBy [

hc:usedContribution [

hc:contributionFrom ?c

] .

GROUP BY ?c
ORDER BY DESC(COUNT(DISTINCT ?d))
LIMIT 3

Listing 9 Sample SPARQL queries on the dataset.

The Human Computation ontology introduced in
Section 4.1 defines also relations as role composi-
tions. Thus, some of the queries could be simplified
or enabled by those simple inferences (e.g. the second
SPARQL query in Listing 9 can be shortened by the
use of the aggregated from or indirectly associated
with relations, cf. Figure 4).

Moreover, given the queries and inferences proposed above, this dataset could be used to change, adjust or improve the game experience. For example,
each Human Computation task is described with the
type of mini-game solved by the player; if from the
dataset analysis, we discover that a specific player is
very good at one mini-game and very bad at solving
another type of challenge, the gameplay could be updated either to present that player with the mini-games
he likes best (so to give a positive feedback and a
stimulus to continue playing) or, on the contrary, to
challenge the player to improve himself with the other
mini-games (so to make the game more demanding
and to keep the player attentive).

6.4. Re-use of the Human Computation Dataset

The publication of the Urbanopoly linked dataset
with an open license has also another interesting con-
sequence. We do not only publish the consolidated in-
formation, but also the individual players contribu-
tions. This enables the comparison of the Urbanopoly
aggregation algorithm with different algorithms and
techniques. Thus, the dataset is openly available for
any interested researcher.

The Human Computation dataset lends itself also to
other kinds of analysis. With regards to the gathered in-
formation, the dataset can reveal what venues features
are the most popular or the easiest to collect or, on the
contrary, the hardest to acquire or the most frequently
mistaken.

Further analysis can be performed to discover the
areas or places where players are more frequently located while playing, or to determine the time required
to contribute different types of information, etc. This
last type of analysis is better suited to understand and
improve the mechanics of the contribution effort and,
as a consequence, to investigate the role of the Urbanopoly game to address the geospatial data curation
effort.

7. Conclusions and Foresight

In this paper, we described the dataset produced
by the Urbanopoly mobile and location-based Game
with a Purpose. Since the goal of the Urbanopoly app
is to quality check, verify, update and enrich existing
geospatial datasets, the presented work can be seen
as the result of data curation over OpenStreetMap (or
LinkedGeoData); for those reasons, the Urbanopoly
geospatial dataset is released with an open data license
and is linked back to the original geospatial sources.
Our next step is to close the loop by automatically
sending new or modified data back to OpenStreetMap.
In our view, Urbanopoly is a successful case of a
broader discipline that applies the power of Human
Computation [15] to Citizen Science [14]. We name
this research field Citizen Computation and we believe
that it can bring effective tools for geospatial data curation by exploiting the physical presence of the contributors in the environment.
