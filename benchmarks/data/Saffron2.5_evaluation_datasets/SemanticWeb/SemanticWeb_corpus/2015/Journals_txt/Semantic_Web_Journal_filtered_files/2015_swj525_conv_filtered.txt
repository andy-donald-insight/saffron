Abstract.  neXtProt  provides  a  comprehensive  knowledgebase  on  human  proteins  complemented  by  an  extensive  cross 
incorporation of annotations from many databases. With the diversity of published data, provenance information becomes critical 
to  providing  reliable  and  trustworthy  services  to  scientists,  thus the  tracking  of  provenance  in  open,  decentralized  systems  is 
especially  important.  Since  the  nanopublication  system  addresses many  of  these  challenges,  we  have  developed  the neXtProt 
Linked Data by serializing in RDF/XML annotations specific to neXtProt and started employing the nanopublication model to 
give  appropriate  attribution  to  all  data.  Specifically,  a  use  case  demonstrates  the  handling  of  post-translational  modification 
(PTM) data modeled as nanopublications to illustrate how the different levels of provenance and data quality thresholds can be 
captured in this model.

interpretation 

With a sustained and ever growing increase in the 
number  of  biological  databases,  the  information 
required 
of 
experimental  results  is  frequently  scattered  over 
multiple  sources.  This  accentuates  the  need  for 
methods  to  integrate  and  query  the  many  disparate 
databases.  Even  though  the  data  are  often  well 
structured  and  the  benefits  of  programmatic  access 
are  indisputable,  the  existence  of  a  specialized  API 
for each data set creates a landscape where significant 
effort is required to integrate each novel data set into 
an  application.  Therefore  the  shift  towards  Linked 
Data  sets  accelerates 
toward  easily 
accessible  open  data  and  facilitates  data  sharing  by 
establishing  links  between  items  in  different  data 
sources  to  create  a  single  global  data  space.  Data 
providers who offer their information as Linked Data 
present exciting opportunities for the next generation 
of  Web-based  applications:  data  from  different 
providers  can  be  aggregated  and 
fragmentary 
information  from  multiple  sources  can  be  integrated 
to  achieve  a  more  comprehensive  view  of  a  given 
field. 

the  move 

annotated 

One  of  the  advantages  of  knowledge  integration 
systems  is  that  the  system  provides  a  complete  yet 
concise  overview  of  existing  data  without  requiring 
the  end-user  to  access  all  data  sources  separately. 
Likewise,  neXtProt  is  a  protein  knowledge  platform 
that  aims  to  support  end-user  research  on  human 
proteins,  similar  to  the  role  that  many  Model 
Organism Databases play for model species  [12, 26].  
neXtProt  facilitates  usability  by  integrating  all  the 
manually 
from 
UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot human entries [3] along  with 
highly  relevant 
information  curated  from  other 
resources as  well as a  wide range of quality-filtered 
data  from  high  throughput  studies.    The  fact  that 
neXtProt  is  restricted  to  information  specific  to  the 
realm  of  human  proteins  focuses  the  annotations 
efforts  to  allow  a  greater  number  of  sources  for 
human  data  to  be  evaluated.  There  are  several 
approaches  for  these  information  expansions:  1) 
manual  curation  from  the  biomedical  literature  by 
experts;  2) 
from 
biomedical  literature  with  text  mining  methods  (e.g. 

automated  data

sequence  annotations,  often  derived  from  data  in 
model  organisms;  and  4)  data  integration  from 
various  experimental  or  computational  sources. 
Among  other 
annotated 
specifically 
includes:  micro-array, 
cDNA,  and  protein  expression  information  [27,  30-
32, 35], subcellular localization [33, 34], high-quality 
mass  spectrometry-derived  proteomics  information 
and,  in  particular,  a  number  of  published  sets  of  N-
glycosylation  and  phosphorylation  sites  [9],  Gene 
Ontology  (GO)  [2,  13]  annotations  [4],  and  the 
mapping of proteins to their genomic context [10]. To 
help  users  rapidly  assess  the  most  reliable  data, 
neXtProt  provides  quality  rankings  for  different 
levels  of  data.  neXtProt  Gold  data  are  of  highest 
quality,  according  to  the  biocurators  judgment. 
When it is possible to assess the data quality through 
quantitative criteria, the threshold for inclusion in the 
Gold  category  are  with  error  rates  estimated  at  less 
than  1%.  neXtProt  Silver  are  good  quality  data, 
also  according  to  biocurators  judgment,  and  if 
quantitative  criteria  can  be  applied,  the  threshold  is 
an  estimated  error  rate  of  less  than  5%.  Silver  data 
are marked as such in the annotations. All other data 
are  assigned  the  neXtProt  Bronze  quality  rating, 
and not incorporated.

publication  of  articles  is  one  avenue  in  which 
researchers  can  contribute  to  the  scientific  body  of 
knowledge.  A  second  possibility  for  contribution  is 
the  submission 
to,  and  curation  of,  biological 
databases. Previously, database annotations have not 
received  the  appropriate  attribution  to  incentivize 
their contribution.  The nanopublication schema [14] 
as a novel publication model may serve to alter this 
trend. The nature of the nanopublication is such that 
it does not need to be related to a full scientific article 
(although this is also an option) but it can also refer 
to a database from which it is derived.  Attribution or 
provenance information present in a nanopublication 
about who created and published the data, and how it 
was  produced,  will  also  provide  several  means  for 
quality assessment, an important concern with Linked 
Data  sets.

for 

Using  the  standard  triple  model  of  the  Resource 
Description Framework (RDF) of the Semantic Web, 
this paper provides a case study description for initial 
exploration  of  the  neXtProt  Linked  Data  with  the 
following two primary objectives: 

1)  To  show  an  initial  conversion  of  the  neXtProt 
data to RDF to provide interaction with the potential 
Semantic  Web  user  community  (starting  with  the 
Open PHACTS project), and  

2)  To  provide  the  nanopublication  approach  for 
connecting semantics with the sequence positions of 
post  translational  modifications  (PTMs)  present  in 
protein  isoforms  with  the  corresponding  provenance 
information. 

2. Modeling neXtProt RDF 

The Linked Data principles are a set of standards 
and  practices  for  publishing  structured  data  on  the 
Web  [5].  They  provide  guidelines  for  uniform  data 
access,  uniform  syntax,  and  a  uniform  data  model, 
but  do  not  address  the  issues  of  heterogeneous 
schemas, 
uncertain 
information  quality.  We  attempted  to  minimize  the 
duplication  of  data  by  focusing  on  annotations 
specific  to  neXtProt  and  excluding  the  integrated 

duplicate 

records, 

and 

UniProtKB  information,  to  reduce  redundancy  with 
the UniProtKB Linked Data. 

Data  sources  may  publish  with  a  mixture  terms 
from widely used vocabularies as well as proprietary 
terms.  It  is  best  practice  to  use  terms  from  widely 
deployed  vocabularies  to  represent  data  wherever 
possible. The first step in the creation of the neXtProt 
Linked  Data  set  was 
to  specify  exactly  what 
information  should  be  encoded,  and  represent  this 
ontologically  using  a  variety  of  vocabularies  (Table 
1). In this initial conversion of the neXtProt data set,

With the continued subsequent improvements of the 
neXtProt  Linked  Data  set,  it  is  envisioned  to  move 
towards  more  standards-based  ontologies  and  wellknown vocabularies. 

  The  design  decisions  for  the  model  of  neXtProt 
Linked  Data  followed  the  neXtProt  schema.  Unlike 
UniProtKB  entries,  which  are  based  on  a  master 
sequence, the data model for neXtProt was developed 
to  present  the  data  corresponding  to  the  specific 
protein isoform.  The data model design represents a 
tight integration of semantically similar data because 
all  information,  for  example,  the  position-specific 
annotations for functional relationships on the amino 
acid  level  and  sequence  polymorphism  information 
are  presented  in  the  context  of  the  specific  protein 
isoform. 

in 

scenarios 

   The neXtProt data set can be applied in a myriad of 
different 
the  biological  domain, 
particularly in respect to resolving queries concerning 
protein  isoforms,  granularity  that  is  missing  from 
other Linked Data resources. A sampling of the data 
that  can  be  retrieved  include  lists  of  proteins  or 
protein isoforms with specific characteristics such as: 
secreted proteins with length greater than 100 amino 
acids  but  not  containing  cysteines;  proteins  highly 
expressed in brain but not in testis; proteins located in 
mitochondrion and lacking a transit peptide; proteins 
expressed in liver and involved in transport; proteins 
having  a  protein  kinase  domain  but  no  kinase 
activity;  proteins  acetylated  and  methylated  and 
located in the nucleus; proteins interacting with more 
than 50 other proteins and not involved in a disease; 
etc.  

3. neXtProt Linked Data production  

The neXtProt XML [11] was used as the basis for 
the generation of the Linked Data. For publishing the 
data  set,  different  serialization  formats  have  been 
used.  NeXtProt 
leverage 
UniProtKBs  RDF/XML  format  whereas  TriG  [6] 
format  is  used  to  represent  the  named  graphs  of 
nanopublications.

entries 

The  current  multi-stage  conversion  procedure 
(Figure 1) is using a template-driven approach, which 
allows  the  data  model  to  gradually  evolve  in  a 
modular and flexible fashion. This will accommodate 
the  gradual  replacement  of  UniProtKB  vocabularies 
and  inclusion  of  additional  nanopublications.  The 
implementation  of  the  template  assembly  tool  is 
realized as a light wrapper utilizing Apache Velocity 
template  engine  [22]  at  its  core  and  Velocifero  [23] 
for object-relational mapping. By separating access to 
the  data-model 
from 
the 
transformation  process 
tool  also  supports 
conversion  of  datasets  other  than  neXtProt.  It  is 
available under an open-source license from [19].  

templates  driving 
the 

The entire procedure is controled by a continuous 
integration  system  (Jenkins/Hudson  [18])  which 
automatically  downloads  the  neXtProt  XML  data 
from  the  ftp-site  [11].  As  new  neXtProt  releases 
become  available,  they  are  converted  and  deposited 
on the download site. In the first stage, the XML data 
is transformed into a relational data model utilizing a 
parallelized  processing  pipeline.  The  relational  data 
model facilitates efficient querying and traversal over 
the large neXtProt dataset. 

Fig. 1: Flow chart of the conversion procedure initially producing a 
neXtProt  relational  data  model  (RDM)  which  is  subsequently 
being queryied to generate the RDF. 

In  the  next  stage,  the  templates  driving  the 
assembly  process  query  the  relational  data-model  to 
produce RDF. The data model mapper ($db reference 
in  Fig. 2) utilizes  named queries to decouple access 
to the model from content creation enabling seamless 
exchange of the underlying query and storage engine. 
The  templates  draw  on  a  library  of  macros  (Fig  2), 
which dynamically load and  render sub-templates at 

modeled with different attributes. 

The  current  RDF  Linked  Data  set  contains 
approximately  97  million  triples  attributed  to  over 
38,000  protein  isoform  entries.  The  RDF  dump  is 
openly and freely available [16].   

To enlighten the data consumer to the details of the 
neXtProt data set, we have published a Vocabulary of 
Interlinked  Datasets  (VoID)  [1]  file  along  with  the 
full data set. The VoID provides basic metadata about 
neXtProt,  including  the  licensing,  using  the  Dublin 
Core  Metadata  (dcterms)  [17]  and  Provenance, 
Authoring  and  Versioning  (pav)  [20]  vocabularies. 
The  metadata  with  details  about  the  location  of  the 
data  dumps  and  the  structural  metadata  concerning 
the data modeling are described using VoID and Data 
Catalog Vocabulary (dcat) [24]. 

As well as offering an open freely accessible data 
set  for  download  under  the  Creative  Commons 
Attribution-ShareAlike  3.0  Unported  (CC  BY-SA 
3.0)  license,  the  complete  neXtProt  data  set  is 
envisaged  to  be  integrated  into  the  Open  PHACTS 
Discovery  platform 
[36],  which  maintains  a 
sustainable infrastructure with open APIs to facilitate 
querying  various  biomedical  datasets  relevant  for 
drug discovery.

that  adequately  expresses  a  single  assertion  and  its 
provenance. 
schema 
(http://nanopub.org/nschema) 
is  composed  of  3 
named graphs: assertion, provenance, and publication 
information (Figure 3). Named graphs [6] are models 
that  allow  entire  groups  of  triples  to  be  assigned  a 
URI.  The  assertion  graph  is  composed  of  one  or 
several  triples  that  state  the  scientific  assertion.  The 
provenance graph contains statements supporting the 
assertion,  such  as  the  methods  used  to  create  the 
assertion, as well as attribution for the assertion. The 
publication 
(publicationInfo)  graph 
contains  provenance  statements  referring  to  the 
creation  of  the  nanopublication  itself.  The  complete 
neXtProt  Linked  Data  set  includes  over  46  million 
nanopublication triples.

isoform  with  a  specific 

For the neXtProt nanopublication, the assertion is 
the minimal unit of information to describe the PTM 
for a specific protein isoform. It states that there is a 
modification on one specific amino acid in a specific 
protein 
type  of  posttranslational  modification  (Figure  4).  The  BioPAX 
ontology 
[8]  was  used,  which  provides  an 
information  model  for  representing  those  data  with 
formally defined semantics, including the possibility 
to  explicitly  model  the  relationships  between  the 
different  entities  in  the  interaction,  namely  the 
protein  isoform  and  the  PTM.  Semantic  science 
Integrated  Ontology  (SIO),  a  simple,  integrated 
ontology  (types,  relations)  for  diverse  knowledge 
representation  across  physical,  procedural,  and 
informational  entities  [15],  was  suited  for  bridging 
the gap between sequence positional claims and their 
physical or biological interpretation. The provenance 
includes  attribution  information  pertaining  to  the 
assertion,  such  as  the  journal  article  as  the  primary 
source  and  UniProtKB  as 
first  stage  of 
annotation.  The  provenance  graph

are  not  included  in  any  formal  ontology.  The

includes the contributing authors, when it was made 
by  a  date/time  stamp,  and  how  the  nanopublication

the  nanopublication  attribution  could  be  linked  to 
each researcher through their unique digital identifier, 
(e.g.  ORCID  identifier,  researcher  ID,  etc)  could 
provide  the  basis  for  the  necessary  metrics  for 
measuring

Nanopublications  encoded  in  RDF  can  be  more 
easily  mined,  queried,  and  retrieved  through  web 
services  and  be  subject  to  computer  reasoning, 
something that is not feasible for regular articles and 
many  annotations 
Importantly, 
nanopublications  may  encourage  potential  data 
contributors to place their data in the public domain 
for other users to freely access and optimally exploit, 

from  databases. 

since nanopublications can be attributed and cited in 
the same way as articles published traditionally [28]. 
Moreover,  particular  attention  can  be  given  to 
indicate the level of data confidence in a clear  way, 
for  example,  with 
the  gold  and  silver  ratings 
attributed in neXtProt since the provenance elements 
of  nanopublication  enable 
these  elements.  The 
eventual  crowdsourcing  of  bronze  level  annotations 
with  a  simple  endorse  or  deny  choice  could  be  a 
simple first process to involve more life scientists in 
contributing  knowledge  to  databases  and  receiving 
credit  for  their  nanopublications.  Finally,  the  PTM 
assertions  present  in  the  neXtProt  nanopublications 
can  allow  the  generation  of  graphic  output  in  the 
form of maps or images as the result of queries based 
on semantics.

    In a distributed and collaborative environment like 
the  current  World  Wide  Web,  there  can  be  a  lot  of 
redundancy  across  data  sources.  While  redundancy 
increases  noisy  or  unnecessary  information,  it  can 
also  be  an  advantage, 
two 
descriptions of the same thing can mutually complete 
and  complement  each  other.  To  avoid  redundancies 
and to support user applications,  we  have purposely 
attempted to incorporate in the Linked Data set only 
data  that  is  specific  to  neXtProt  database  while 
reducing  the  overlap  with  the  UniProtKB  Linked 
Data.  In  cases  where  neXtProt  shares  common 
concepts  with  other  databases  the  ontology  choices 
followed the UniProtKB Linked Data model. 

As we proceed with the future developments of the 
neXtProt Linked Data, which includes the conversion 
to  more  widely  used  attributes,  the  possibility  of 
using  nanopublications  will  be  considered  for  all 
relevant neXtProt specific scientific assertions.
