Abstract. Nowadays, we are witnessing a rapid increase of spatiotemporal data that permeates different aspects of our everyday life such
as mobile geolocation services and geo-located weather sensors. This big
amount of data needs innovative analytics techniques to ease correlation and comparison operations. Visual Analytics is often advocated as
a doable solution thanks to its ability to enable users to directly obtain
insights that support the understanding of the data. However, the grand
challenge is to offer to visual analytics software an integrated view on
top of multi-source, geo-located, time-varying data. The abstractions
described in the FraPPE ontology address this challenge by exploiting
classical image processing concepts (i.e. Pixel and Frame), a consolidated
geographical data model (i.e. GeoSparql) and a time/event vocabulary
(i.e. Time and Event ontologies ). FraPPE was originally developed to
represent telecommunication and social media data in an unified way
and it is evaluated modeling the dataset made available by ACM DEBS
2015 Grand Challenge.

1 Introduction

Nowadays, we are witnessing a rapid increase of sources exposing geo-located
time-varying data such as social media, mobile telecommunication, taxis, etc.
Making sense of those data sets typically requires to compare and correlate them.
Visual Analytics  the science of analytical reasoning facilitated by interactive
visual interfaces [12]  is often advocated as an effective solution for those tasks.
For instance, Figure 1 illustrates a real case of visual analytics for a general
audience1 where: a grid of 6x3 cells is overlaid to a city street map, green circles
represent the number of tweets posted in a time interval from each cell, and the
fill colour opacity value of each cell is mapped to the number of mobile calls from
each cell. As shown in [2], people without specific expertise in data analytic can
easily spot the cells where the two signals are correlated.

However, data is not often ready for visual analytics. Usually, geo-located
time-varying data of this type has first to be aggregated over time and space.

Fig. 1. A real-world example of visual analytics of two heterogenous datasets.

FraPPE is a vocabulary designed exactly for this purpose following Methontology [6] guidelines. It exploits classical image processing concepts (Frame and
Pixel)  familiar to designers of visual analytics solutions  as well as common
sense concepts (Place and Event) using a consolidated geographical data model
(GeoSparql [3]) and a time/event vocabulary (Time [8] and Event ontologies [9]).
The basic building blocks of FraPPE were originally developed to represent,
in an homogenous way, heterogeneous data streams for the CitySensing2 installation proposed to the public of Milano Design Week 2014. Some of its concepts
(i.e., dividing the physical space in cells using a grid and linking time-varying
data to cells) were used to publish the dataset of Telecom Italia Big Data Challenge 20143. In this paper, we present the first formal version of this vocabulary
(Section 2) and we evaluate it (Section 3) by assessing its compliance to Tom
Grubers principles (i.e., clarity, coherence, minimal encoding bias, minimal ontological commitment, extendibility) modelling the dataset of ACM DEBS 2015
Grand Challenge4.

FraPPE vocabulary is published in Linked Open Vocabularies5 while community discussion, issue tracking and advancement are handled via github6. Those
resources are maintenined and sustained on the long term by the Stream Reasoning research group of Politecnico di Milano. The data of ACM DEBS 2015
Grand Challenge modelled in FraPPE can be queried using a SPARQL endpoint7
whose content is described with VoID [1] machine processable metadata8.

2 FraPPE

The overall idea of FraPPE is depicted in Figure 2. A portion of the physical
world is illustrated using a map in the top-right side of the figure. A grid,
which, in this example, is made of 4 cells, sits between the physical world and
the film that captures a frame per time-interval. The frame being captured

in the current time interval n is directly in front of the grid. The previous
frame, captured at time n1, is on its right. The next empty frame, which will
be captured at time n+1 is on the left. The two captured frames both have 4
pixels (one for each cell). The physical world contains two places (e.g. A the
start and B the end points of a journey). The frame captured at n+1 contains
a pixel that accounts for the event EA occurred in A at n+1 (e.g., the pick
up of some good). In a similar manner, the just captured frame accounts for the
event EB occurred in B at n (e.g., the drop-off of some good).

M. Balduini and E.D. Valle

More formally, FraPPE ontology is organised in three interconnected parts:
the geographical part, the time-varying one and the provenance one (see
Figure 3). Place, Cell and Grid belong to the geographical part and reuse
geosparql vocabulary [3]. They are geosparql Features whose default geometry
are respectively a point, a surface and a multisurface. Event, Pixel and
Frame are in the time-varying part. The Event concept is borrowed from the
Event ontology [9]. The provenance part includes the activities capture and
synthetize (see also Figure 4) and reuses the PROV Ontology [4] (PROV-O).
An Event has a location in a Place that is sfWithin9 a Cell  the
basic spatial unit of aggregation of information in FraPPE  which, in turn, is
sfWithin a Grid.

A Pixel is the time-varying representation of a Cell. It is the only element
in the conceptual model that carries information through the hasValue data
property. As in image processing, this value represent a measure of intensity of
some phenomena in the real world. For instance, it can represent the number of
micro-posts posted in a given time interval within a certain Cell. Each Pixel
refersTo a single Cell, contrariwise a Cell could be referredBy many
different Pixels that captures different information associate to the same Cell,
e.g., the already mentioned number of micro-posts, but also the number of mobile
phone calls or the number of good pick-ups.

Similarly, a Frame is the time-varying counterpart of a Grid. It is a single complete picture in a series forming a movie. FraPPE distinguishes between
two types of frames: the CapturedFrames and the SyntheticFrames (see
Figure 4). A CapturedFrame contains a Pixel for every Cell in the Grid
it wasCapturedFrom. Different Frames represent different images of the
observed phenomena at the same samplingTime, e.g., a frame captured the volume of the social activity while another one captured the volume of the mobile
phone calls at 12.00.

which is an Entity in PROV-O. Also Grid is an Entity. This is because FraPPE
proposes the ternary relationships Capture and Synthetize as specialisations
of the relationship Activity of PROV-O.

to model

This allows

that a CapturedFrame wasGeneratedBy a
Capture Activity startedAtTime i and endedAtTime j that used a given
Grid. The object property wasCapturedFrom is the result of the chaining of
those two wasGeneratedBy and used object properties. Moreover, the value of
the samplingTime data property, which describes the CapturedFrame, is the
one assigned to the startedAtTime data property that describes the captured
activity.

Similarly, a SyntheticFrame wasGeneratedBy by a Synthetize Activity
that used one or more Frames. The idea is to derive a frame from one or more
others. The synthetize operation can be a filter applied to the values of the pixels,
or an aggregation of values of pixels across frames or the difference between the
values associated to the pixels of two different frames. For a fully fledge algebra
of some of the operations we intend to model, we refer interested readers to [11].
For instance, in our work on CitySensing [2], we captured for 2 months a
frame every 15 minutes associating the value of each pixel to the volume of mobile
phone calls in the 10,000 cells we divided Milan into. In this way, we captured
96 frames per day. Then, we synthetized 96 frames (one for each slot the day
is divided into) associating to the value of each pixel a Gaussian distribution
avg,std2 where avg is the average and std is the standard deviation of the values
associated to the respective pixels in the captured frames. Each pixel is, thus,
associated with a statistical model of the volume of mobile phone calls. With
these models, given a pixel in the frame captured at 12.00, whose value is v,
we can compute an anomaly index to associate to the value of a pixel in a new
synthetic frame using the formula 2avg,std2(v)  1. A value of that pixel close
to 1 (or -1) indicates an extraordinary higher (lower) volume compared to the
usual activity in that slot from 12.00 to 12.15 in the associated cell of Milan.

3 Evaluation

In order to evaluate FraPPE, we check if it observes the five principles of Tom
Gruber [7]: clarity, coherence, minimal encoding bias, minimal ontological commitment and extendibility.

FraPPE observes the clarity principle because all definitions are documented
in natural language (see version of FraPPE on github6). The terms proposed
in FraPPE are: (i) common terms in spatial-related vocabularies (e.g., Place,
Cell, Grid); (ii) well known terms of the image processing domain (e.g., Pixel,
Frame, Capture, or Sythetize); and (iii) terms defined in other ontologies
(e.g., Event, Instant, Entity, or Activity). Moreover, they are independent of the
social and telecommunication domains, for which FraPPE was originally defined.

Indeed, FraPPE terms can be used for other domains as demonstrated in publishing data for the Telecom Italia Big Data Challenge3.

FraPPE is coherent, i.e., all FraPPE inferences at T-box level are consistent
with the definitions and in modelling A-boxes containing social, telecommuni-
cation, environment, traffic, and energy consumption data, we never inferred
inconsistent or meaningless data.

FraPPE has a minimal encoding bias because it is encoded in OWL2-
QL. Indeed, it uses only subclass axioms, property domain, property range
and inverse object properties. We explicitly avoided adding cardinality restric-
tions, because in CitySensing [2] we use FraPPE to integrate data following an
ontology-based data access approach.

FraPPE requires a minimal ontological commitment, meaning that, as Tom
Gruber recommended, FraPPE makes as few claims as possible about the geolocated time-varying data being modelled allowing who uses FraPPE to specialise
and instantiate it as needed.

Last but not least, we tested in details that FraPPE is extendable by modelling the dataset made available by ACM DEBS 2015 Grand Challenge4. The
challenge proposes a taxi route analysis scenario based on a grid of 150x150
Kms with cells of 500x500 m. A stream of data represents the route of a taxi
rides in terms of: (i) taxi description, (ii) pick-up and drop-off information (e.g.,
geographical coordinates of the place and time of the event), and (iii) ride information (e.g., tip, payment type and total amount). In the Listing 1, we report a
subset of the information representing a single taxi ride in FraPPE . The pickup event represents the start of the ride and contains the taxi id. The drop-off
event represents the end of the trip and it is connected to all the information
about the ride. The fragment models the geographical part of the ride using
two places within two different cells of a single grid. Moreover, it models
the time varying-part of the ride using two events captured in two pixels of
a single frame along with the provenance part through the capture activity.
Indeed, we reuse all FraPPE concepts, we specialise Event in PickUpEvent and
DropOffEvent, and we add attributes (e.g., tripTime, and totalAmount) and
an object property (i.e., connected) specific of the taxi ride domain.

Synthetic frames are also important in the challenge. One of the problems,
assigned to the challengers, asks to compute the profitable cells for a given
time interval. We wrote a SPARQL query that computes the answer; this is
the Sythetize activity that used CapturedFrames of the type illustrated in
Listing 1 to construct a SytheticFrame where the values of the pixels are
associated with the profitability of the cells they refer to.

4 Conclusions

In this paper, we propose FraPPE, a novel vocabulary that fills in the gap
between low-level time-varying geo-located data and the high-level needs of mapcentric visual analytics. Vocabularies to publish the low-level data exist, e.g.,
geosparql vocabulary [3], event ontology [9] or time ontology [8]. FraPPE reuses
them. The high-level (oriented to visual analytics) part is missing, but the terms,
which we choose for FraPPE vocabulary, are largely used among practitioners.
The genesis of FraPPE terms can be found in the Social Pixel approach, proposed
in [11], and in common practices used in geo-spatial knowledge discovery and
data mining domain, e.g., [5] where the authors discuss on the optimal size of
cells in grids used for the analysis of human mobility.

M. Balduini and E.D. Valle

FraPPE has an high potential. We demonstrated it applying FraPPE to city
data integration within CitySensing [2]. A preliminary version of FraPPE was
used in 2014 to publish open the data of Telecom Italia Big Data Challenge
that covers the telecommunication, social, environmental, and energy domains.
In this paper, we further exemplify such a potential by publishing in RDF the
dataset of the ACM DEBS Grand Challenge 2015.

In designing FraPPE , we followed Tom Grubers principles. Moreover,
FraPPE is described using machine processable metadata (i.e., label, creator,
issued, versionInfo, priorVersion, license, and imports). The ACM DEBS
Grand Challenge dataset is accessible via SPARQL7 and described using VoID8.
As future works, we want to investigate how to improve the modelling of
the values associated to the pixels. We started an investigation on ontologies of
the units of measurement. Our best candidate, at this moment, is [10], because
it allows also to model dimensionless quantities such as the anomaly index.
Moreover, we want to investigate an effective approach to link a Grid to Where
On Earth Identifiers10 in order to define a unique ID for every possible Cell
on earth. Last, but not least, we want to foster the adoption of FraPPE by
publishing more datasets; our intention is to start from the datasets release as
open data within the Telecom Italia Big Open Data Challenge 2014.
