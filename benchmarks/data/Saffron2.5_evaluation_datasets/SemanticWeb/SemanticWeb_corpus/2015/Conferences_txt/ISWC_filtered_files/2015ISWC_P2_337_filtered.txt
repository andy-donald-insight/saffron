Abstract. This paper presents the Transport Disruption ontology, a
formal framework for modelling travel and transport related events that
have a disruptive impact on travellers journeys. We discuss related mod-
els, describe how transport events and their impacts are captured, and
outline use of the ontology within an interlinked repository of the travel
information to support intelligent transport systems.

1 Introduction

Transport is frequently viewed as a key sector within smart cities for improving
citizens quality of life [2], [8], [13]. Such visions anticipate that IT systems will
utilise data made available by the integration of physical and digital transport
infrastructures to address the mobility challenges faced by cities today. One such
challenge is minimising the impact of transport disruptions [4]: road congestion is
estimated to cost an average of 1% of GDP across the European Union [4], while
the absence of real-time information about the impact of disruptions is a major
factor in the dissatisfaction with, and reduced attractiveness of public transport
[10,11]. However, tackling such problems requires addressing the challenges of
data interoperability, analysis, information extraction, and reasoning presented
by such environments - challenges that Semantic Web and linked data are key
technologies in overcoming [9].

The shared models and vocabularies provided by ontologies are fundamental
to any Semantic Web solution. Ontologies have previously been used to create an
integrated ecosystem of the transport information required to support a real-time
passenger information system [3]. The Transport Disruption ontology described
in this paper enables the extension of such ecosystems with details of travel
and transport related events that can have disruptive impacts on mobility. As
such, the Transport Disruption ontology contributes a key model to the ongoing
work of the Semantic Web community in addressing the data challenges of smart
cities, and a major transport challenge faced by society.

This paper is structured as follows: section 2 describes the ontology; section 3
details its application in a use case; section 4 discusses related work; and section 5
concludes the paper.

2 The Transport Disruption Ontology

The Transport Disruption ontology provides a formal framework for modelling
travel and transport related events that can have a disruptive impact on an
agents planned travel. The ontology is available at its namespace:
http://purl.org/td/transportdisruption#, abbreviated to td throughout, and
the associated github project1. Figure 1 outlines the ontology schema.

The ontology was defined following an analysis of disruption information
provided by transport authorities and operators of bus, rail, ferry, and air public
transport services in the UK. This identified the requirement to capture the
occurence of an event in terms of its type, location, time period, compound and
causal relationships to other events, and any impact experienced by agent(s)
that have to adapt their plan(s) because of it. Following linked data publishing
best practise [5], Linked Open Vocabularies2 and the Linked Open Data3 cloud
were reviewed to identify existing ontologies that could be used to meet these
requirements. The selected ontologies and their integration with the Transport
Disruption ontology are discussed below.

The main modelling choice focused on the representation of disruptions. The
transport research community [6,7], [12] define the notion of disruptive events,
i.e. events that impact on the supply of transport (infrastructure or services),
costs of using transport, or some combination [7]. Such events can affect single
or multiple transport links in a given area, and impact on travellers in a way
greater than that experienced through the typical day-to-day variability in travel
plans.

This is captured by the td:DisruptiveImpact and td:DisruptiveEvent classes
in the Transport Disruption ontology. A disruptive impact is defined as the
action of one or more events causing or tending to prevent an agents planned
travel from continuing as expected. The td:DisruptiveEvent class is aligned to the

?
Event ontology4 as a subclass of event:Event. td:DisruptiveEvent is designed to
allow events of any type that have caused a td:DisruptiveImpact to be classified
as disruptive; as such, it is not the intention that this class is extended further.
The Event ontology defines events as an arbitrary classification of a space/time
region, by a cognitive agent. This aligns with the transport research perspective
of disruptive events as, for example, a traveller classifying roadworks occurring
within an area and time that they are traveling as causing an undesirable impact
on their journey. Use of the Event ontology also allows existing data defined with
this model to be used with the Transport Disruption ontology.

td:DisruptiveImpact is an extension point for developers to define the types of
impact relevant to their intended usage of the ontology. This may include descriptions of delays to an agents journey or details of a journey that cannot be completed due to, for example, a cancelled flight. A minimum cardinality constraint
defines that each td:DisruptiveImpact individual must define the foaf:Agent that
it is td:relevantTo. The Friend-of-a-Friend (FOAF) ontology5 was selected as it is
a commonly used model for describing people, organisations, and groups, and its
use allows reuse of existing FOAF data with the Transport Disruption ontology.
td:Plan provides an extension point for developers to describe an agents
plan that may be impacted by an event. For example, this could be a persons
travel itinerary defined by an expected departure time, location and means of
transport to a destination; or a bus schedule providing expected arrival times
at stops along a route as defined by the bus operator. Each td:DisruptiveImpact
also references at least one td:Plan that it td:impactsOn.

A cardinality constraint is defined stating that each individual of type td:Dis-
ruptiveImpact must reference at least one event:Event through the td:hasCause
property. Similarly, each td:DisruptiveEvent must reference at least one td:Disru-
ptiveImpact that it caused via the td:causeOf property. An owl:inverseOf relationship is defined between td:hasCause and td:causeOf, ensuring the correspondences between individuals of these classes can be materialised by a description
logic reasoner. A reasoner can then also infer the td:DisruptiveEvent type for
event:Events that have caused a td:DisruptiveImpact.

New concepts extending event:Event are defined to capture the different types
of events that may disrupt an agents travel plans. These are based on the analysis of published disruption information and aspects of the DATEX II6 specifi-
cation. DATEX II models the road traffic domain and exchange of data between
road management systems, including types of road disruption. The types of events
modelled as subclasses of event:Event include td:OperatorAction, td:Infrastructure
Management, td:RoadClosure, td:SpeedRestriction, td:InfrastructureConstruction,
td:InfrastructureMaintenance, td:TrafficElementEvent, td:AbnormalTraffic, td:-
Accident, td:EnvironmentalConditions, td:InfrastructureFailure, td:Infrastructu-
reFault,
td:PublicTrans-portDelay,
td:PublicTransportCancellation, and td:PublicTransportDiversion.

The Event ontology defines that events are associated with a temporal region
describing their time of occurrence using the OWL-Time ontology7. The Timeline ontology8 is also recommended to model intervals in terms of start and
end timestamps. Defining such temporal intervals for transport-related events is
encouraged as it can be used to determine if an event is completed, active, or
planned, which are frequently used terms for defining the status of disruptions.
The Event ontology also defines that events are associated with a spatial
object that locates the event using the WGS84 ontology9. Providers of travel
disruption information typically use a variety of location references, including a point with latitude and longitude values, roads, public transport access
points (bus stops, railway stations, etc.), and geographic areas such as counties,
cities, and localities. Classes from other ontologies representing such locations
can be used with the Transport Disruption ontology by defining alignments to
the WGS84 ontology. For example, defining the Road class from the LinkedGeoData ontology10 or Stop class from the Transit ontology11 as subclasses of
geo:SpatialThing.

Compound relationships between events can be modelled using the
event:sub event property. This can be used to capture the compound nature of
disruptions: for example, a td:RoadClosure occurring as part of a td:RoadWorks
event. The event:factor property links events to owl:Things that are factors of
the event. This can capture additional relationships between events, such as a
td:AbnormalTraffic event contributing to a td:PublicTransportDelay event.

3 Social Journeys Use Case

A motivation for the Transport Disruption ontology is to support the use of integrated data sets of travel and transport information to identify disruptions that
agents may encounter during travel. The Social Journeys project12 is developing
a system to provide this information for bus users within the city of Aberdeen,
UK. This section discusses the use of the Transport Disruption ontology within
the project and outlines a versatile approach for obtaining the data required by
the system from open data repositories13.

the variety of location references used by providers of travel disruption informa-
tion. This includes details of roads within Aberdeen, which are extracted14 from
OpenStreetMap15 (OSM). The exported XML file consists of nodes, geospatial
points with latitude and longitude values, and ways, ordered lists of nodes used
to represent polygons (e.g. buildings) and polylines (e.g. roads) with attributes
providing further details such as the building or road name. A script converts
this into RDF and imports it to the Social Journeys knowledge base.

Access points to public transport and details of localities are used to associate
events with bus stops, railway stations, airports and areas (localities) within the
city. A triplication script converts the CSV data files for the NaPTAN and NPTG
open data sets16 published by the UK Department for Transport17. Extracted
bus stops are also linked to the description of the road that they are on.

Details of bus services within the city are extracted from the Traveline
open data repository18 of bus operators, routes, and schedules. This data is

transport (http://data.gov.uk/dataset/nptg).

available as XML files encoded using the TransXChange schema19; a parser
creates RDF descriptions using the Transit ontology of bus services that use
stops within Aberdeen. The extracted bus service descriptions include the service name, operator, and references to the bus stops used.

Event descriptions are currently manually created based on reports from
sources including the transport authority20, bus operator21, and a local radio
station22. Scripts to create event descriptions automatically are being developed.
Finally, as part of the system being developed, travellers are requested to
provide details of their planned bus journeys. Each journey is described in terms
of the departure and arrival times, days of travel, and the journey stages. Each
stage defines the origin bus stop, bus service used, and destination stop.

3.2

Identifying Potential Disruptive Impacts

Potential travel disruptions can be identified by performing spatial and temporal
matching of the events and planned journeys in the knowledge base. For example,
a spatial match can be based on a common piece of infrastructure (e.g. road),
while a temporal match can be determined if the time period of an events
occurance intersects with that of a journey, as illustrated by following query:

construct {

_:_ a td:DisruptiveImpact; td:impactsOn ?journey;

td:hasCause ?event; td:relevantTo ?agent.

} where {

select distinct ?journey ?event ?agent where {

?journey a td:Plan; transit:service ?service;

sj:expectedArrivalTime ?arrivalTime;
sj:expectedDepartureTime ?departureTime; sj:daysOfTravel ?travelDay.

?agent td:hasPlan ?journey.
?event a event:Event; event:place/sj:way ?way;

event:time/tl:beginsAtDateTime ?eventStartTime;
event:time/tl:endsAtDateTime ?eventEndTime.

?service transit:serviceStop/transit:stop/sj:onWay ?way.
bind (xsd:dateTime(xsd:string(?travelDay)+"T"+xsd:string(?arrivalTime))

as ?ja)

filter (?eventStartTime <= ?ja)
bind (xsd:dateTime(xsd:string(?travelDay)+"T"+xsd:string(?departureTime))

as ?jd)

filter (?eventEndTime >= ?jd)

}

}

The td:DisruptiveImpact individuals returned by this query could be used
by the system to alert users about the possible disruption. The simple approach
shown to spatial matching could be extended to include more complex spatial

reasoning, for example, using GeoSparql23 functions for boundary box matches.
Storing the td:DisruptiveImpact individuals (after assigning a URI) would enable
stakeholders to perform various types of analysis. For example, the bus operator
could attempt to identify which bus services may be affected by events today or
tomorrow, or, as part of reviewing historical performance, query for any services
that were affected by disruptions during a specific time period.

This example illustrates the initial work necessary for intelligent travel disruption reporting. However, the knowledge base is by its nature dynamic, changing as futher details of events become available or new events occur. Future work
will focus on recording the provenance of knowledge base updates and any reasoning performed with the data. This will involve alignment of the Transport
Disrupion ontology with PROV-O24, the W3C recommendation for representing
provenance information. Indicating the quality, particularly of td:DisruptiveImp-
act and td:DisruptiveEvent individuals will be a key factor in supporting people decide if they should act upon the data or not. We plan to use the Qual-
O ontology and assessment framework [1] to define metrics that evaluate the
quality of such data. For example, a metric could rate the relevancy of a
td:DisruptiveImpact to a person by determining if roadworks are located on
their expected route of travel: if so the relevancy would be high, otherwise the
relevancy score would be reduced based on the proximity of the roadworks to the
route. This reflects the observation that while roadworks may be on the same
road (as in the example above) they may not actually be encountered by the
person.

4 Related Work

Along with semantic models of public transport routes and schedules provided
by the Transit and GTFS25 ontologies, models have also been defined for other
aspects of the transport domain. These include the Road Traffic Management
Ontology26, the scope of which is limited to describing the actions a moving vehicle can perform (e.g. accelerate, change lane), and its relation to other vehicles
(e.g. relative speed, road position). The draft Road Accident Ontology27 models road accidents in terms of the vehicles and living beings involved, relevant
documents (e.g. driver licence, insurance certificate), location, and organisations
(e.g. insurance companies). However, it is limited to only defining a single type
of event (road accident) and does not consider any consequential impact. The
Passim ontology28 models systems that convey transport information to trav-
ellers. Passim models such systems in terms of name, how it is accessed (website,
SMS, mobile application), and coverage in terms of the modes of transport and
towns, cities, and geographic regions that information is provided for.

5 Conclusion

Ontologies provide a key technology for supporting data integration. Alignment
of the Transport Disruption ontology with existing models, such as Event, FOAF,
Transit, and LinkedGeoData extends the existing semantic modelling capabilities for integrated mobility data sets. The Transport Disruption ontology enables
descriptions of travel and transport related events and their disruptive impacts
on mobility. The defined event types and details of their impacts can be extended
as necessary for use in different applications. As such, we argue that the Transport Disruption ontology provides a necessary component in enabling the contribution of Semantic Web efforts to addressing the mobility challenges faced by
society today and in future smart cities. Along with the future work discussed
above, we plan further evaluation of the ontology through use cases explored in
collaboration with the Semantic Web and transport research communities.
