Abstract. Collaborative tagging systems have nowadays become important data
sources for populating semantic web applications. For tasks like synonym detection and discovery of concept hierarchies, many researchers introduced measures
of tag similarity. Even though most of these measures appear very natural, their
design often seems to be rather ad hoc, and the underlying assumptions on the
notion of similarity are not made explicit. A more systematic characterization
and validation of tag similarity in terms of formal representations of knowledge
is still lacking. Here we address this issue and analyze several measures of tag
similarity: Each measure is computed on data from the social bookmarking system del.icio.us and a semantic grounding is provided by mapping pairs of similar
tags in the folksonomy to pairs of synsets in Wordnet, where we use validated
measures of semantic distance to characterize the semantic relation between the
mapped tags. This exposes important features of the investigated similarity measures and indicates which ones are better suited in the context of a given semantic
application.

1 Introduction

Social bookmarking systems have become extremely popular in recent years. Their
underlying data structures, known as folksonomies, consist of a set of users, a set of
free-form keywords (called tags), a set of resources, and a set of tag assignments, i. e.,
a set of user/tag/resource triples. As folksonomies are large-scale bodies of lightweight
annotations provided by humans, they are becoming more and more interesting for
research communities that focus on extracting machine-processable semantic structures
from them. The structure of folksonomies, however, differs fundamentally from that of
e.g., natural text or web resources, and sets new challenges for the fields of knowledge
discovery and ontology learning. Central to these tasks are the concepts of similarity
and relatedness. In this paper, we focus on similarity and relatedness of tags, because
they carry the semantic information within a folksonomy, and provide thus the link
to ontologies. Additionally, this focus allows for an evaluation with well-established
measures of similarity in existing lexical databases.

Budanitsky and Hirst pointed out that similarity can be considered as a special case
of relatedness [1]. As both similarity and relatedness are semantic notions, one way of
defining them for a folksonomy is to map the tags to a thesaurus or lexicon like Ro-
gets thesaurus1 or WordNet [2], and to measure the relatedness there by means of wellknown metrics. The other option is to define measures of relatedness directly on the network structure of the folksonomy. One important reason for using measures grounded
in the folksonomy, instead of mapping tags to a thesaurus, is the observation that the vocabulary of folksonomies includes many community-specific terms which did not make
it yet into any lexical resource. Measures of tag relatedness in a folksonomy can be defined in several ways. Most of these definitions use statistical information about different types of co-occurrence between tags, resources and users. Other approaches adopt
the distributional hypothesis [3,4], which states that words found in similar contexts
tend to be semantically similar. From a linguistic point of view, these two families of
measures focus on orthogonal aspects of structural semiotics [5,6]. The co-occurrence
measures address the so-called syntagmatic relation, where words are considered related if they occur in the same part of text. The contextual measures address the paradigmatic relation (originally called associative relation by Saussure), where words are
considered related if they can replace one another without affecting the structure of the
sentence.

In most studies, the selected measures of relatedness seem to have been chosen in a
rather ad-hoc fashion. We believe that a deeper insight into the semantic properties of
relatedness measures is an important prerequisite for the design of ontology learning
procedures that are capable of harvesting the emergent semantics of a folksonomy.

In this paper we analyse five measures of tag relatedness: the co-occurrence count,
three distributional measures which use the cosine similarity [7] in the vector spaces
spanned by users, tags, and resources, respectively, and FolkRank [8], a graph-based
measure that is an adaptation of PageRank [9] to folksonomies. Our analysis is based on
data from a large-scale snapshot of the popular social bookmarking system del.icio.us.2
To provide a semantic grounding of our folksonomy-based measures, we map the tags
of del.icio.us to synsets of WordNet and use the semantic relations of WordNet to infer
corresponding semantic relations in the folksonomy. In WordNet, we measure the similarity by using both the taxonomic path length and a similarity measure by Jiang and
Conrath [10] that has been validated through user studies and applications [1]. The use
of taxonomic path lengths, in particular, allows us to inspect the edge composition of
paths leading from one tag to the corresponding related tags, and such a characterization
proves to be especially insightful.

The paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 we discuss related work. In Section 3
we provide a formal definition of a folksonomy and describe the del.icio.us data on
which our experiments are based. Section 4 describes the measures of relatedness that
we will analyze. Section 5 provides examples and qualitative insights. The semantic
grounding of the measures in WordNet is described in Section 6. We discuss our results
in the context of ontology learning and related tasks in Section 7, where we also point
to future work.

2 Related Work

One of the first studies about folksonomies is Ref. [11], where several concepts of
bottom-up social annotation are introduced. Ref. [12,13,11] provide overviews of the
strengths and weaknesses of such systems. Ref. [14,15] introduce a tri-partite graph
representation for folksonomies, where nodes are users, tags and resources. Ref. [16]
provides a first quantitative analysis of del.icio.us. We investigated the distribution of
tag co-occurrence frequencies in Ref. [17] and the network structure of folksonomies
in Ref. [18]. Tag-based metrics for resource distance have been introduced in Ref. [19].
To the best of our knowledge, no systematic characterization of tag relatedness in folksonomies is available in the literature.

Ref. [20] generalizes standard tree-based measures of semantic similarity to the
case where documents are classified in the nodes of an ontology with non-hierarchical
components. The measures introduced there were validated by means of a user study.
Ref. [21] analyses distributional measures of word relatedness and compares them with
measures of semantic relatedness in thesauri like WordNet. They concluded that even
though ontological measures are likely to perform better as they rely on a much richer
knowledge source, distributional measures have certain advantages. For example, they
can easily provide domain-specific similarity measures for a large number of domains,
their ability to determine similarity of contextually associated word pairs more appropriately [. . . ].

The distributional hypothesis is also at the basis of a number of approaches to synonym acquisition from text corpora [22]. As in other ontology learning scenarios, clustering techniques are often applied to group similar terms extracted from a corpus, and
a core building block of such procedure is the metric used to judge term similarity.
In order to adapt these approaches to folksonomies, several distributional measures of
tag relatedness have been introduced in theoretical studies or implemented in applications [23,24]. However, the choice of a specific measure of relatedness is often made
without justification and often it appears to be rather ad hoc.

A task which depends heavily on quantifying tag relatedness is that of tag recommendation in folksonomies. Scientific publications in this domain are still sparse. Existing work can be broadly divided in approaches that analyze the content of the tagged
resources with information retrieval techniques [25,26] and approaches that use collaborative filtering methods based on the folksonomy structure [27]. An example of the
latter class of approaches is Ref. [28], where we used our FolkRank algorithm [8] for
tag recommendation. FolkRank-based measures will be also covered in this paper.

Relatedness measures also play a role in assisting users who browse the contents of
a folksonomy. Ref. [29] shows that navigation in a folksonomy can be enhanced by
suggesting tag relations grounded in content-based features.

A considerable number of investigations are motivated by the vision of bridging the
gap between the Semantic Web and Web 2.0 by means of ontology-learning procedures based on folksonomy annotations. Ref. [15] provides a model of semantic-social
networks for extracting lightweight ontologies from del.icio.us. Other approaches for
learning taxonomic relations from tags are provided by Ref. [23,24]. Ref. [30] presents
a generative model for folksonomies and also addresses the learning of taxonomic rela-
tions. Ref. [31] applies statistical methods to infer global semantics from a folksonomy.

The results of our paper are especially relevant to inform the design of such learning
methods.

3 Folksonomy Definition and Data

In the following we will use the definition of folksonomy provided in Ref. [8]: 3
Definition 1. A folksonomy is a tuple F := (U, T, R, Y ) where U , T , and R are finite
sets, whose elements are called users, tags and resources, respectively., and Y is a
ternary relation between them, i. e., Y  U  T  R. A post is a triple (u, Tur, r) with
u  U , r  R, and a non-empty set Tur := {t  T | (u, t, r)  Y }.
Users are typically represented by their user ID, tags may be arbitrary strings, and resources depend on the system and are usually represented by a unique ID. For instance,
in del.icio.us the resources are URLs, while in YouTube the resources are videos.

For our experiments we used data from the social bookmarking system del.icio.us,
collected in November 2006. In total, data from 667, 128 users of the del.icio.us community were collected, comprising 2, 454, 546 tags, 18, 782, 132 resources, and 140,
333, 714 tag assignments. As one main focus of this work is to characterize tags by
their properties of co-occurrence with other tags, we restricted our dataset to the 10, 000
most frequent tags of del.icio.us, and to the resources/users that have been associated
with at least one of those tags. One could argue that tags with low frequency have a
higher information content in principle  but their inherent sparseness makes them less
useful for the study of both co-occurrence and distributional measures. The restricted
folksonomy consists of |U| = 476, 378 users, |T| = 10, 000 tags, |R| = 12, 660, 470
resources, and |Y | = 101, 491, 722 tag assignments.

4 Measures of Relatedness

A folksonomy can be also regarded as an undirected tri-partite hyper-graph G = (V, E),
where V = U  T  R is the set of nodes, and E = {{u, t, r} | (u, t, r)  Y } is the
set of hyper-edges. Alternatively, the folksonomy hyper-graph can be represented as
a three-dimensional (binary) adjacency matrix. In Formal Concept Analysis [32] this
structure is known as a triadic context [33]. All these equivalent notions make explicit
that folksonomies are special cases of three-mode data. Since measures of similarity
and relatedness are not well developed for three-mode data yet, we will consider twoand one-mode views on the data. These views will be complemented by a graph-based
approach for discovering related tags (FolkRank) which makes direct use of the threemode structure.

4.1 Co-occurrence

Given a folksonomy (U, T, R, Y ), we define the tag-tag co-occurrence graph as a
weighted undirected graph whose set of vertices is the set T of tags. Two tags t1 and t2

3 Ref. [8] additionally introduces a user-specific sub-tag/super-tag relation, which we will ignore

here as it is not relevant for del.icio.us.

are connected by an edge, iff there is at least one post (u, Tur, r) with t1, t2  Tur. The
weight of this edge is given by the number of posts that contain both t1 and t2, i. e.,

w(t1, t2) := card{(u, r)  U  R | t1, t2  Tur} .

(1)

Co-occurrence relatedness between tags is given directly by the edge weights. For
  T with
a given tag t  T , the tags that are most related to it are thus all the tags t
 = t such that w(t, t
) is maximal. We will denote this co-occurrence relatedness by
t
co-occ. For its computation, we first create a sorted list of all tag pairs which occur
|Y |2
together in a post. The complexity of this can be estimated as O(
2|P| )). Then,
we group this list by each tag and sort by count, which corresponds to an additional
complexity of O(|T|2 log(|T|2)). Y, P, T denote the set of tag assignments, posts and
tags, respectively (see Section 3).

4.2 Distributional Measures

) for t = t

We introduce three distributional measures of tag relatedness that are based on three
different vector space representations of tags. The difference between the representations  and thus between the measures  is the feature space used to describe the tags,
which varies over the possible three dimensions of the folksonomy. Specifically, for
X  {U, T, R} we consider the vector space RX, where each tag t is represented by a
vector vt  RX, as described below.
Tag Context Similarity. The Tag Context Similarity (TagCont) is computed in the
vector space RT , where, for tag t, the entries of the vector vt  RT are defined by
  T , where w is the co-occurrence weight defined above, and
vtt := w(t, t
vtt = 0. The reason for giving weight zero between a node and itself is that we want
two tags to be considered related when they occur in a similar context, and not when
they occur together. The complexity of this measure comprises the cost of computing
2|P| ) + |T|2 log(|T|2)), plus the cost of
|Y |2
co-occurrence (see above), i.e., O(
comparing each tag pair, which is O(|T|22|X|), X  T . In our case |X| = 10, 000.
Resource Context Similarity. The Resource Context Similarity (ResCont) is computed in the vector space RR. For a tag t, the vector vt  RR is constructed by
counting how often a tag t is used to annotate a certain resource r  R: vtr :=
card{u  U | (u, t, r)  Y } . In terms of complexity, the tag-resource counts amount
for O(|Y | log(|Y |)), plus the pairwise comparison cost of O(|T|22|R|).
User Context Similarity. The User Context Similarity (UserCont) is built similarly to
ResCont, by swapping the roles of the sets R and U : For a tag t, the vector vt  RU
is defined as vtu := card{r  R | (u, t, r)  Y } . In this case, the complexity is
O(|Y | log(|Y |) + |T|22|U|)).
In all three representations, we measure vector similarity by using the cosine measure,
as is customary in Information Retrieval [7]: If two tags t1 and t2 are represented by
v1, v2  RX , their cosine similarity is defined as: cossim(t1, t2) := cos (v1, v2) =
. The cosine similarity is thus independent of the length of the vectors. Its
||v1||2||v2||2
value ranges from 0 (for totally orthogonal vectors) to 1 (for vectors pointing into the
same direction).

4.3 FolkRank

The PageRank algorithm [34] reflects the idea that a web page is important if there are
many pages linking to it, and if those pages are important themselves. We employed the
same principle for folksonomies [8]: a resource which is tagged with important tags by
important users becomes important itself. The same holds, symmetrically, for tags and
users. By modifying the weights for a given tag in the random surfer vector, FolkRank
can compute a ranked list of relevant tags.
More specifically, FolkRank considers a folksonomy (U, T, R, Y ) as an undirected
graph (UTR, E) with E := {{u, t},{u, r},{t, r} | (u, t, r)  Y }. For a given tag t,
it computes in this graph the usual PageRank [34] with a high weight for t in the random
surfer vector.4 Then, the resulting vector is compared to the case of PageRank without
random surfer (which equals the simple edge count, as the graph is undirected). This
way we compute the winners (and losers) that arise when giving preference to a specific
tag in the random surfer vector. The tags that, for a given tag t, obtain the highest
FolkRank are considered to be the most relevant in relation to t. Ref. [8] provides a
detailed description of the algorithm. The complexity of FolkRank can be estimated as
O(i|Y |), where i is the number of iterations (the typical values used in this study were
30-35).

5 Qualitative Insights

Using each of the measures introduced above, we computed, for each of the 10, 000
most frequent tags of del.icio.us, its most closely related tags. As we used different
(partially existing) implementations for the measures we investigated, runtimes do not
provide meaningful information on the computational cost of the different measures.
We refer the reader to the discussion of Section 4 on computational complexity.

Table 1 provides a few examples of the related tags returned by the measures under
study. A first observation is that in many cases the tag and resource context similarity
provide more synonyms than the other measures. For instance, for the tag web2.0 they
return some of its alternative spellings.5 For the tag games, the tag and resource similarity also provide tags that could be regarded as semantically similar. For instance, the
morphological variations game and gaming, or corresponding words in other languages,
like spiel (German), jeu (French) and juegos (Spanish). This effect is not obvious for
the other measures, which tend to provide rather related tags instead (video, software).
The same observation holds for the functional tag tobuy (see Ref. [16]), for which the
tag context similarity provides tags with equivalent functional value (to buy, buyme),
whereas the FolkRank and co-occurrence measures provide categories of items one
could buy. The user context similarity also yields a remarkable amount of functional
tags, but with different target actions (toread, todownload, todo).

4 In this paper, we have set the weights in the random surfer vector as follows: Initially, each
tag is assigned weight 1. Then, the weight of the given tag t is increased according to w(t) =
w(t) + |T|. Afterwards, the vector is normalized. The random surfer has an influence of 15 %
in each iteration.

5 The tag web at the fourth position (tag context) is likely to stem from users who typed web

2.0, which the early del.icio.us interpreted as two separate tags, web and 2.0.
