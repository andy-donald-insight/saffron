ABSTRACT
The number of datasets in the Linking Open Data Cloud
increases rapidly and has reached a total of 295 by September 2011. Various content domains are covered by those
datasets, such as Media, Government or Geographic Data,
all directly linked to each other building a huge graph of
interlinked structured data. However, data describing the
mobile network topology including its components and (dy-
namic) properties (e.g., traffic or number of users in a radio
cell) are not semantically available yet in the LOD Cloud.

Therefore, we propose the OpenMobileNetwork  a dataset
for mobile networks and devices, which is semantically modeled using the Linked Data principles.
It provides structured RDF data describing mobile networks, their topology
and components (e.g., base stations, mobile devices or WiFi
access points). Utilizing this dataset in combination with
interlinked information that is present in the LOD Cloud,
various applications can be realized that depend on mobile
network and positioning data, such as Semantic Locationbased Services. In this paper, however, we focus on the realization of a Power Management in Mobile Networks.

to fulfill the increasing requirements on mobile network us-
age. In Germany, mobile network providers have more than
100.000 base stations working 24/7, which causes a total
energy consumption of approx. 1455 GWh per year. How-
ever, the provided capacities are not always fully utilized,
e.g., at nights or in rural areas, enabling the possibility to
save energy through an adaptive and context-aware power
management in radio networks. This can be done by dynamically de- and reactivating network components (e.g.,
base stations) or by adaptively reconfiguring the network to
the users needs based on a certain information basis gained
from the network.

Mobile network components, end devices or other external
sources provide several contextual information, such as the
traffic generated in a cell, the average daily traffic of a cell,
the number of users, points of interests or events in certain
areas, that can be exploited for this purpose. Following a
rather classic context management approach [4], raw data is
extracted from the context sources and stored in relational
database tables. Based on predictions and rules, the data is
correlated with each other in order to answer a query.

However, adding new types of context sources to such a
system turns out to be very time-consuming since the implemented applications have to be adjusted to each new type
of context source in order to extract information from them.
Collecting structured data from third-party services also requires manual effort due to the fact that these services provide proprietary Web APIs and developers have to implement against those APIs. In addition, the relational model
comes at the cost of lacking semantic information and relations between different domains of context data. To overcome these disadvantages, we propose a different approach
using the principles of Linked Data [5].

Over the years, many researchers, institutes, libraries, etc.
published their data according to those principles covering
various content domains all directly linked to each other
building a huge graph of interlinked structured data, which
is also known as the Linking Open Data (LOD) Cloud 1. The
number of datasets in this cloud has been increasing rapidly
and has reached a total of 295 by September 2011. These
datasets provide a huge pool of contextual information interlinkable to each other that can be exploited by contextaware services in general and for power management purposes in our case. There are also datasets available in the
LOD Cloud that semantically model sensor data. Le-Phuoc
et al.
[8] propose SensorMasher, which is a platform that
makes sensor data available as Linked Data and interlinks it

with other resources of the LOD Cloud. Linked Sensor Data
[9] and Sense2Web [1] are two other projects, which publish
sensor data on the Web of Data. However, data modeling
the mobile network topology including its components and
(dynamic) properties (e.g., traffic or number of users in a
radio cell) or information related to WiFi hotspots and mobile devices are not semantically available yet in the LOD
Cloud.

Therefore, a new open dataset called the OpenMobileNetwork has been designed that semantically models open-source
mobile network topology and WiFi hotspot topology data
coming from databases like OpenCellID 2 and OpenBMap3
in RDF and combines it with semantically modelled live context data extracted from smartphones or WiFi access points.
The instance data generated in form of triples is integrated
into the OpenMobileNetwork Ontology that describes concepts of a mobile network topology (mapped onto geographic
positions) and relationships between network entities.

Other research works also propose semantic descriptions
for telecommunication networks. Qiao et al. [11], for exam-
ple, present the Telecommunications Service Domain Ontology (TSDO) consisting of several sub-ontologies, such as the
Terminal Capability Ontology or Network Ontology [10] that
semantically describe telecommunication network services.
The Network Ontology introduces concepts and features of
mobile as well as fixed networks and models the relationship
between different network access technology types, such as
GSM, UMTS or WiFi. Villalonga et al.
[13], on the other
hand, propose the Mobile Ontology being a candidate for
standardization that defines a semantic model for service delivery platforms in Next Generation Networks. The Mobile
Ontology also includes several sub-ontologies, which cover
Services, Context and Communication Resources, for exam-
ple. However, these ontologies focus on delivering semantics
to telecommunication network services and are not designed
using the Linked Data principles, so that data in the LOD

28Motions, http://www.opencellid.org/

http://www.openbmap.org/

Cloud can be exploited through links to the proposed ontologies (and the provided instance data).

Utilizing the OpenMobileNetwork dataset in combination
with interlinked information that is present in the LOD
Cloud (e.g., DBpedia [3], LinkedGeoData [12], etc.), various applications can be realized that depend on mobile network and positioning data, such as Semantic Location-based
Services.
In this paper, we focus on the realization of a
Power Management in Mobile Networks based on the Open-
MobileNetwork.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: In
Section 2, context data requirements are identified, which
are essential for a power management in mobile networks
and which build the basis for the development of the Open-
MobileNetwork. Afterwards, an overview is given about
open-source projects collecting mobile network data. The
design of the OpenMobileNetwork is presented in Section 4.
Section 5 discusses possible power management scenarios,
whereas Section 6 evaluates the dataset in form of a performance analysis. In Section 7, the paper is concluded and
also issues are described that we plan to adress in the future.

2. CONTEXT DATA REQUIREMENTS

We identified four types of power management supporting
contextual sources, which deliver data describing context parameters of various domains (see Table 1). The first context
source (a priori information) consists of static information
parameters, which are supplied by network providers, network component manufacturers or even open-source projects.
This information comprises data describing the actual topology of the mobile radio network, such as the coordinates
and coverage information of the base stations or locations
and ranges of WiFi access points. Context data acquired
directly from mobile devices is described by the user con-
text. This includes data, such as the list of base stations in
reach of the mobile device, the technical capabilities of the
device itself (i.e., which radio technologies are supported)
or information about service usage and generated traffic, for

                                                18example. Network context, on the other hand, depicts contextual information gained from network components, e.g.,
data describing the average load of a (WiFi or base station)
cell or the expected number of users at a given time. Finally,
some network optimization scenarios can be enriched by information acquired from third-party context sources, such as
web services or databases.

An adaptive, context-aware and technology-comprehensive
power management in mobile networks can only be established if a combination of context data coming from some
of the identified context sources is exploited in a mashup-
manner. As mentioned before, a priori information is usually owned by mobile network operators and builds the basis
for a power management in mobile networks since the network topology to be optimized has to be known. However,
mobile network operators keep this data very secret. Todays
smartphones provide the means to measure cell data with
which the mobile network topology of different operators
can be approximately derived. OpenCellID and OpenBMap
are examples for open-source projects that use smartphone
clients and collect cell data via a crowd-sourcing approach
in order to establish a complete database of base stations,
their cell IDs and locations.

The user and network context, on the other hand, describes context data, which can either be used to show live
information about the network (e.g., current traffic in a base
station or number of current users in a cell) or which can
be exploited to calculate several profiles using historic data,
such as traffic profiles, service usage or user behaviour. This
type of context data can also be collected via smartphones
and WiFi access points using a device-centric crowd-sourcing
approach. Comparing the list of identified third-party context sources in Table 1 and the data present in the Linking
Open Data Cloud, we can also see that a lot of the context
information needed for a power management in mobile networks is already available in the cloud in the form of structured data, such as points of interests described in DBpedia
and LinkedGeoData or weather information coming from the
Linked Sensor Data dataset.

Data describing the mobile network topology including its
components and (dynamic) properties as described above
are not semantically available yet in the LOD Cloud. In order to combine all those context sources in one dataset with a
consistent data model, we propose the OpenMobileNetwork 4
dataset that provides open-source mobile network topology
data in RDF combined with live context data describing
smartphones and WiFi access points [2]. This dataset is
enriched with other context information by directly linking
them to available datasets in the LOD Cloud. Furthermore,
concepts of other vocabularies are used, so that also other
aspects, such as spatial data or dataset dynamics, are sup-
ported. The OpenMobileNetwork meets Level 3 (complete)
of the LOD Cloud Diagram Compliance Level and is currently under review for an addition into the LOD Cloud.

Utilizing this dataset as part of the LOD Cloud, various
applications can be realized that depend on mobile network
and positioning data. Mobile network operators can use it
as a playground for research and analyzing trends, which
then can be easily adapted to their own data. One such a
scenario  a Power Managament in Mobile Networks  is
presented in this paper.

3. OPEN-SOURCE PROJECTS COLLECT-

ING MOBILE NETWORK DATA

In the first version of the OpenMobileNetwork, we focused
on the integration of mobile network topology data coming
from OpenCellID and OpenBMap. These two projects are
open-source and collect several information via smartphone
clients with the goal of creating a complete database of base
stations, their cell IDs and locations worldwide.
3.1 OpenCellID

OpenCellID is a project led by 8Motions, which provides
cell data for countries all over the world under the Creative
Common Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported license. Currently the database consists of a total number of 1.433.295
cells calculated out of 56.402.616 measurements by taking
the average of all geo coordinates given for each cell. This
data is provided as a dump in two versions: The first dump
has a size of 4.4 GB and includes all measurements, whereas
the second filtered version being 76 MB consists of one location per cell. Smartphone clients for various operating
systems can be downloaded in order to further extend the
database with cell information. Table 2 depicts a list of information related to base stations, which are provided by
OpenCellID.

Unfortunately, OpenCellID does not provide any information about the type of a cell, so that it is not possible
to distinguish between 2G (GSM, GPRS, EDGE) and 3G
(UMTS, HSPA) cells. Furthermore, no information is given
about neighboring cells of a serving base station. In addi-
tion, the cell range attribute is mostly 0, which makes this
parameter almost useless.
3.2 OpenBMap

OpenBMap, on the other hand, is an alternative project
under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
Unported and Open Database License (ODbL) v1.0 licenses
and collects not only mobile network, but also WiFi access
points and Bluetooth data. By 13th June 2012, OpenBMap
has been acquiring mobile network data for 171 countries,
604 different mobile networks, 36.078 location area codes
and 781.909 cells out of which 278.151 are trusted. The
database also consists of 654.416 WiFi access points for 57
countries. Data provided by OpenBMap related to the mobile network is listed in Table 3.

In contrast to OpenCellID, OpenBMap provides much more
valueable information, such as the signal strength, the network access type and the neighboring cells (even though the
neighboring cell information is only available for 2G net-
works). However, the number of cells collected by OpenCellID is much more than the cell number of OpenBMap

Figure 1: OpenMobileNetwork - System Architec-
ture

The Context Data Collection part comprises the extrac-
tion, filtering and storing of context data from open-source
projects related to mobile networks (e.g., OpenCellID and
OpenBMap), smartphones and WiFi access points. A Filter function provides the capability to filter the datasets
according to certain constraints. This data is stored in a
relational database (RDB) enabling the usage of it also for
other purposes than the OpenMobileNetwork. In the Data
Triplification part, the instance data located in the relational database is imported and mapped onto RDF instance
triples. In another step, the RDF triples are integrated into
the OpenMobileNetwork Ontology that defines a vocabulary
for a mobile network topology. Furthermore, the LOD Cloud
Interlinking module is responsible for interlinking the created resources to other resources in the LOD Cloud. Finally,
the RDF data is exported into the Virtuoso RDF Triple
Store, which provides a SPARQL endpoint, so that contextaware services, such as the Power Management Entity, can
query the triple store in order to get the required data. According to the Linked Data principles, the resources are also
represented via HTML/RDF descriptions on the website,
which also provides a visualization of the mobile network on
a map showing cells, their coverage area and further detailed
information when clicking on them.

4.1 Context Data Collection

As mentioned earlier, we firstly worked on integrating data
coming from the OpenCellID and OpenBMap datasets into
the OpenMobileNetwork. In order to do that, we analyzed
the data provided by those datasets (see Table 2 and Table 3)
and concluded that all attributes except for signal strength,
reception level and timing advance are relevant for the first
version of the OpenMobileNetwork. In the near future, the
signal strength and timing advance information is going to
be used as well in order to derive the cell range of base
stations dynamically.

Two loaders have been implemented  the OpenBMapLoader (OBM-L) and the OpenCellID-Loader (OCID-L) 
that frequently download measurement information based
on a certain time interval and insert the relevant data of
every cell measurement, such as the cell ID, location area
code, mobile network code, mobile country code, geo coordinates and cell technology into the relational database
(RDB). OpenBMap only offers raw data of every measure-
ment, which requires special summarization and filtering,
whereas the OCID-L already gets summarized cell data from
OpenCellID that can be easily used for further processing.
In the next step, the OpenMobileNetwork-Filter (OMN-
F) is applied to the data stored by OBM-L and OCID-L.
Therefore, the OMN-F provides special filter mechanisms
to ensure the accuracy of the externally loaded data. Other
constraints are also included, which are mainly related to
the fact that we focus on the coverage area of Germany at
first. For example, only those cells are considered whose mobile country code have the value 262 (for Germany) [6] and
whose geo coordinates are within Germany. Furthermore, all
values are deleted that did not have a valid mobile network
code for German mobile network operators (e.g., 01-11/77
for Telekom, Vodafone, O2 and E-Plus, etc.) [7]. In addi-
tion, the cell ID and location area code had to be greater
than 0. Finally, the OMN-F summarizes the measurement
information to a dataset of unique cells.

Having filtered and accurate cell information, the CellMerger (CM) is used to merge both datasets from OBM-L
and OCID-L producing one single dataset of cells. Further-
more, the CM utilizes neighboring relations of base stations
from OBM-L to enrich the dataset with information of neighboring cells and range of coverage. The whole import process
will be extended considering worldwide base station data in
the near future.

During the OpenCellID and OpenBMap data import process for Germany, 4.913.739 measurements for cell IDs were
considered out of which we calculated 135.727 cells. 36.056
cells are operated by Telekom, whereas Vodafone deployed
29.841 base stations. 37.720 cells are from the provider E-
Plus, O2 has 30.000 cells and 2.109 base stations are operated by others. The network access type is known for
2.438 cells. Due to the fact that neither OpenCellID nor
OpenBMap provides reliable cell range information, we assigned average cell range values for cells with known cell
types (e.g., 2.000m for GSM macro cells and 500m for UMTS
and HSPA micro cells), so that we are able to simulate cell
coverage areas and neighboring cells on the OpenMobileNetwork map.
4.2 Data Triplification

The Data Triplification part comprises three functional
entities. The Instance Data Triplification and Ontology Inte-

                                                20gration functions are handled by the RDB-to-Virtuoso-Tool
(RVT). This tool defines a mapping schema, which enables
the easy creation of triples out of the relational data. Furthe-
more, it includes the integration of the instance data into the
OpenMobileNetwork Ontology. The mapping schema is easily extendable enabling us to enhance the ontology by new
classes, properties and instances whenever needed. After-
wards, the RVT is used to transfer the cell information from
the relational database to the Virtuoso RDF Triple Store
making the complete dataset accessible through the OpenMobileNetwork SPARQL endpoint. The RVT also keeps
track of the last added and triplified timestamp, ID, measurement and its source, so that certain RDF triples can be
updated whenever new measurements are inserted into the
relational database. This ensures sustainability and up-to-
dateness of our dataset.

Links to other datasets are generated by the LOD Cloud
Interlinking function. The POI-Getter (POI-G), which is
one important component of this function, takes the geographic coordinates of each single cell in the OpenMobileNetwork dataset and queries the database of LinkedGeoData in
order to get the point of interests within the range of coverage of the cell. The POI-G then adds the information to the
specific cell within the Virtuoso RDF Triple Store. In the
first approach, 613.912 POIs have been added, which led to
a runtime of about 16 hours.

For cells with lacking information about their range of
coverage, a radius of 250 meters has been assumed. This
is a relatively small radius for a mobile network cell since
in reality there are no cells with such a small coverage area
(except for home use femto cells). But this range was chosen
on purpose in order to ensure that we only interlink those
points of interests that are within a close vicinity of a cell
with an unknown cell technology. In further approaches, the
range of each cell will dynamically change depending on the
measurements, current signal strengths, etc.

dinates. Executing both queries deliver the following points
of interests for the base station omn:cell1745_6481_262_1:

Another component of the LOD Cloud Interlinking is the
DBpedia-Linker (DBP-L), which enables the interlinking of
mobile network codes and mobile country codes with detailed information in the DBpedia dataset.

Each application described in the Subsections 4.1 and 4.2
can be executed independently according to the actual needs
and recognizes if an update of an existing dataset is needed.
This leads to maximum flexibility and improves the overall performance. Furthermore, the implementation is integrated into a time-based scheduler for automatic and regular updates of the cell information within the relational
database and the Virtuoso RDF Triple Store. This ensures
up-to-date data and reduces the effort of manual maintenance of the dataset.
4.3 Ontology Design

The clean OpenCellID and OpenBMap cell data covering
Germany is mapped onto RDF triples by either using existing vocabulary concepts from known ontologies, such as
RDF, RDF Schema (e.g., rdf:type) andWGS84 Geo Positioning (e.g., geo:lat)5, or by creating new concepts for
the OpenMobileNetwork.

omn-owl. Cell resources are uniquely identified by combining the cell ID with the location area code, mobile country code and the mobile network code in the form Cel-
lID_LAC_MCC_MNC. Each cell has this unique id attached to
the URI http://www.openmobilenetwork.org/resource/cell.

by merging the mobile country code with the mobile network
code (e.g., MCC_MNC) and combining it with the URI http:

inverse to each other and describe that mobile network operators operate certain cells. Each cell has its location (geo:lat,
geo:long), cell range (omn-owl:cellRange) and cell type
(omn-owl:cellType) bound to it. Furthermore, cells are
linked to other cells via the property omn-owl:neighbouringCell
if the neighboring cells of the serving cell are known. In ad-
dition, the semantically enriched instance data is integrated
into the OpenMobileNetwork Ontology, which defines a taxonomy for a mobile network topology. This ontology will
evolve over time when adding new datasets into the Open-
MobileNetwork.

The relation omn-owl:Covers is set between the OpenMobileNetwork and LinkedGeoData and interlinks all points of
interests that are covered by a cell in the range of 250 me-
ters, whereas owl:sameAs is used to get more information
from DBpedia that is related to the mobile country code
and mobile network code. The ontology is visualized in Figure 2. Currently, this dataset has 1.839.487 triples created
for 135.727 cells with 613.912 links to the dataset of LinkedGeoData and 15 to the dataset of DBpedia.

4.4 Mobile Network Map

In order to visualize the mobile network topology, we developed a mobile network map6 using OpenStreetMap7 and
the data present in the OpenMobileNetwork.

This map shows base stations located in Germany in form
of colored markers. Each color represents a certain mobile
network operator. Magenta stands for Telekom, whereas red
represents Vodafone. E-Plus is visualized by green markers and O2 by blue markers. Several display options are
provided allowing to filter the visualization by cell technology (e.g., Undefined, 2G or 3G) or by mobile network
operators. At the moment, the display options are implemented statically since we focused on data related to Ger-
many. Later, when the OpenMobileNetwork is extended by
worldwide data, those options will be loaded automatically
based on the position of the map, the mobile country code
and mobile network code. By clicking on a base station, further information in form of RDF triples is shown in which
this base station is the subject. This also includes all the
links to LinkedGeoData and DBpedia.

All resources visualized on the map are identified via HTTP
Cool URIs and are dereferenceable using either a Semantic
Web browser or a usual HTML Web browser. This means
that a click on a resource will be redirected to the RD-
F/HTML descriptions of the resource via content negoti-
ation. Figure 3 shows the mobile network topology map for
Berlin, Germany.

5. POWER MANAGEMENT SCENARIOS

Power Management scenarios that will be addressed using

the OpenMobileNetwork are manifold.

One scenario might take place on certain points of interests (see Figure 4). Having links between radio network cells
modeled in the OpenMobileNetwork (white resources and lit-
erals) and other context information coming from DBpedia
or LinkedGeoData (grey resources and literals), a query can
be sent to the system assembling a list of all cells near the
Olympic Stadium in Berlin, which are operated by E-Plus.
Listings 3 shows the SPARQL query example, whereas Table
5 lists the result returned by SPARQL.

                                                22OpenMobileNetwork, such as the current total traffic in a cell
or the number of users served by it. By utilizing this kind of
information, the query can be enhanced in that way, for ex-
ample, that only those E-Plus cells are requested, which are
unused, do not excess a certain load threshold or a certain
number of users at the moment (see dotted arrows in Figure 4). These cells are then candidates for being shut down
due to the low demands. Furthermore, information about
football clubs being tenants in the Olympic Stadium (e.g.,
Hertha BSC) and their match schedule could be retrieved in
order to proactively optimize the capacity needs of this area
during match times.

6.1 Map-based Performance Measurements

We analyzed the performance of the map based on certain
criteria and made conclusions that affected the visualization
of base stations. The criteria were:

1. We measured how long it took to initialize and load

the map itself.

2. We measured the time needed to load one base station.

3. We defined two exemplary areas: a rural area (e.g.,
the little town called Niemegk) and a city area (e.g.,
Berlin).

4. For both areas, we analyzed the time needed to load
all base stations for different zoom levels minus the
initialization time for the map.

Depending on the browser and the server capacity utiliza-
tion, the initialization and loading of the map took about
1.34s on average and each marker (base station) needed another 12ms of loading time. The results for loading base
stations in two different areas and two different zoom levels
were as follows:

City Area (Berlin)
City Area (Berlin)

363ms
7.161s
1.925s

Table 6: Performance of the Map

Another example might be a park in a city during summer
(e.g., OpenMobileNetwork cells in combination with areas
from LinkedGeoData). Usually, this park is very crowded
on the weekend, so the Power Management Entity can be
advised to activate all available resources in the area to supply the expected requirements. Though, additional context
information might improve the accuracy of the calculated
prediction as cold and rainy weather (coming from Linked
Sensor Data) might cause most people to stay at home or
follow other activities in their free time. Hence, predictions
incorporating not only time of day and weekday, but also
further (indirect) contextual information are able to improve
the quality of the composed power management predictions.

6. PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS

The OpenMobileNetwork can only be effectively used by
users and context-aware services if the performance for retrieving and visualizing data is high enough. Therefore, we
made two performance analyses: The first evaluation is related to the visualization of base stations on the map and
the second measurement deals with the time of retrieving
base stations under different conditions.

During the analyses, the server was configured as follows:
AMD Athlon II X4 640 Processor with four 3 GHz cores,
16 GB RAM and two 500GB SATA hard drives in RAID
1. The OpenMobileNetwork was running on a 3 GHz core,
2 GB RAM, 20 GB HD VM with Ubuntu 11.04, Apache
2.2.17, MySQL 5.1.63 and Virtuoso 6.1.5. The client was a
MacBook Pro, Intel Core 2 Duo with 2.4 GHz, 6 GB DDR3
RAM, Mac OS X Lion 10.7.x and the Safari 5.1.x Browser.

The results in Table 6 show that in rural areas, the zoom
level does not play any role since we do not have a lot of
base stations to display in those areas. However, taking
zoom level 13 as a reference and applying it to the defined
city area, 3.004 base stations were loaded that took about
7.161s of time, whereas zoom level 14 only displayed 1.427
cells in 1.925s. Besides the high loading time, having more
than 3.000 cells on a map led to the fact that a lot of markers
overlapped each other making it not usable anymore for the
user. Therefore, we decided to visualize base stations dynamically for the given area on the map with a zoom level
equal to or greater 14.
6.2 Performance Measurements for Retriev-

ing Data

The power management scenarios mentioned in Section 5
describe a Power Management Entity application that retrieves cells from a certain area or in the vicinity of certain points of interests in order to perform network opti-
mizations. Therefore, we assembled five different SPARQL
queries and measured the time required to retrieve the results from the OpenMobileNetwork SPARQL endpoint. Two
of the five queries retrieve all cells that cover the Olympic
Stadium and O2 World in Berlin, whereas the other two
queries get all cells in certain districts of Berlin, such as
Kreuzberg and Charlottenburg. These districts are defined
by a surface area of 1km2. The last query retrieves all cells
that are operated by Telekom.

In the results of Table 7, we can see that the performance
of the OpenMobileNetwork is quite good. The time of retrieving cell data in the vicinity of points of interests as

Table 7: Performance of Retrieving Data

well as for bigger areas is under 0.05s. Even querying the
OpenMobileNetwork for the whole mobile network topology
of Telekom does only take up to 4s, which is relatively fast.
These results show that the OpenMobileNetwork is suitable
for providing a large amount of data quickly, so that contextaware services in general and a Power Management Entity
in our case, can further use this data for network optimiza-
tions.

7. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK

In this paper, we presented the OpenMobileNetwork, which
is a dataset for mobile networks and devices semantically
modeled using Linked Data principles. At the moment, this
dataset consists of mobile network topology data coming
from OpenCellID and OpenBMap.

The next steps of the data import process will comprise
WiFi hotspot topology data collected by OpenBMap, context information generated by smartphones (e.g., end devices connected to cells, total traffic generated by smart-
phones, traffic profiles, etc.) and WiFi access points (e.g.,
number of users, total traffic, etc.). The collection of such
live measurement data in a crowd-sourcing approach will
enable us to evaluate the potential of energy savings by performing power management algorithms and predictions as
described in the scenarios in Section 5. Furthermore, we
will work on the automatic interlinking of the cells with
areas (e.g., streets, districts, cities and states) and events
described in other datasets, such as DBpedia and Linked-
GeoData. In addition, dependencies between cells and their
types will be modeled within the OpenMobileNetwork Ontology showing information about whether a cell belongs to
the GSM, UMTS or LTE network and whether it is a macro,
micro, pico or femto cell. Topological predicates that are already described in the GeoSPARQL Ontology 8 will also be
considered in the modeling process.

Having a basic static model of a mobile network topol-
ogy, dynamic features, such as the traffic generated in those
cells and services used by end users have to be taken into
consideration as well. Therefore, in order to incorporate service usage information, a service classification scheme will
be described and linked to the OpenMobileNetwork Ontol-
ogy, which lists what kind of service can be delivered by
what kind of radio technology. Our research will also focus on how to integrate dynamic context information into
the OpenMobileNetwork and on how to provide push mechanisms as soon as relevant changes occur in the network.

The OpenMobileNetwork can be utilized by any application that depends on mobile network and positionig data.
In this paper, we used this dataset for power management
purposes, which was shown in two exemplary scenarios.
