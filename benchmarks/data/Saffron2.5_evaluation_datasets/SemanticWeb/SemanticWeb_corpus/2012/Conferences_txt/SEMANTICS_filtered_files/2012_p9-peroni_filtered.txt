ABSTRACT
Recently, several ontologies have been introduced for semantic publishing. However, scholarly publishing,
like other
real-world domains, needs to be described also in terms
of precise temporal durations and the particular contexts
in which the relevant processes take place. For instance,
a document changes status during its publication process,
e.g., from draft to submitted to under review to accepted for publication, and so on. Similarly, ones roles may
change with time: ones affiliation with an academic institution or ones role as a journal editor are likely to change
over time. Existing well-known ontologies used to describe
individuals and bibliographic entities in the Linked Data
are currently not able to model situations of temporary or
context-dependent possession (e.g., the holding of a status or
of a role). In this paper, we address this issue by introducing two ontologies for semantic publishing, the Publishing
Roles Ontology and the Publishing Status Ontology, that define the roles of people and the statuses of documents in the
scholarly publishing domain.

and Semantic Web technologies to enhance a published doc-
ument, such as a journal article, so as to enrich its meaning,
facilitate its automatic discovery, enable linking and data
integration with other semantically related articles, provide
actionable access to its data, etc. [17, 18]. One of the most
important research area in semantic publishing is the development of semantic models (i.e., ontologies) that enable
the publication of related semantic data into the Linked
Data arena according to appropriate vocabularies and requirements of scholarly authoring and publishing.

We have recently developed the suite of Semantic Publishing and Referencing (SPAR) ontologies1 to describe all
aspects of the scholarly publishing domain as comprehensive machine-readable RDF metadata. For this purpose, we
looked at many existing ontologies to reuse for our needs, but
most of what we found was deemed insufficient for addressing all the requirements we collected to properly describe
the publishing domain.

The most serious obstacle we encountered relates to how
the description of personal roles and of the statuses of documents needs to vary in time and according to changing con-
texts, a crucial requirement in the publishing domain. The
contextual and time-dependent aspect of such roles and statuses need to be handled formally by ontological models.
Unfortunately, many existing ontologies are unable to describe situations in which a status or a role is held only for
a particular period, or only with respect to special contexts.
In this paper we introduce and illustrate PRO (the Publishing Roles Ontology) and PSO (the Publishing Status On-
tology), two of the SPAR ontologies we developed for the
description of the roles of people involved in publishing and
the various statuses of documents within the publishing pro-
cess. These ontologies have been developed on an ontological
pattern called time-indexed value in context (TVC), also illustrated in this paper. This pattern allows one to relate
an entity (e.g., a person) to a particular value or property
(e.g., a role held by that person) in a particular period and
according to a particular context  e.g. the social entity (e.g.
an organisation) or physical entity (e.g. a book) to which
persons role refers to. TVC integrates smoothly with existing ontologies, and can be used as an intermediate model
when converting domain-specific assertions (e.g., concerning
a persons roles) between ontologies.

The basic assumptions of TVC are grounded on specific
and well-known works in ontology engineering  e.g.
[2, 7,
12, 16, 20]  which were taken into account with the aim of

the problem of how to describe in the Linked Data environ-
ment, and in a particularly compact and expressive way, the
situation in which an entity has a specific property value
within a specific time and according to a specific context
and domain.

The rest of the paper is organised as follows. In Section 2
we illustrate design approaches commonly used in the Linked
Data world for modelling situations in the publishing domain
that change over time, namely agents roles and document
statuses. In Section 3, we introduce a general pattern used as
a starting point for the development of the TVC pattern that
properly addressing these situations (Section 4). In Section 5
we present our two SPAR ontologies, PRO and PSO, which
were developed by strictly following the prescription given
by TVC. Finally, in Section 6, we draw out some conclusions
for our work.

2. EXISTING ONTOLOGIES

When modelling a domain, we often need to describe scenarios in which an entity has some value only within a specific temporal interval and/or contextual (e.g. social, cul-
tural, physical) environment, and a different one (or none
at all) otherwise. For instance, in the publishing domain,
we may want to describe the status of a document at any
given moment (e.g., draft, under review, accepted, published),
the institution of which an author is a member, or the role
held by people in the publishing process. All these scenarios
involve an entity, a value, and in particular a time and a
context within which the entity is associated to the value.

Most ontologies are unable to model such scenarios effec-
tively, for different reasons. Three techniques in particular
have been used in attempts to address this modelling issue
- class subsumptions, property links and inter-linked classes,
but each falls short in some aspect.
2.1 Subsumptions and time-dependent classes
To clarify this design technique and the issues that arise
from it, let us consider the agent/role relations as described
in the Portal Ontology2 of the AKT Reference Ontology.
This ontology defines the class Student as a person (class
portal:Person) who studies at (property portal:studies- at)
some institution (class portal:EducationalOrganization), as
follows (in Turtle):

portal : Student a owl : Class

; rdfs : s u b C l a s s O f [ owl : i n t e r s e c t i o n O f (

portal : Person
[ a owl : R e s t r i c t i o n

; owl : o n P r o p e r t y portal : studies - at
; owl : s o m e V a l u e s F r o m

portal : E d u c a t i o n a l O r g a n i z a t i o n ] ) ] .

The fact of being a person is time-independent  Silvio
Peroni is a living person while Kurt Vonnegut is a dead per-
son, but we still describe both as persons. On the contrary,
the fact of being a student is strictly time-dependent  Silvio
Peroni was recently a graduate student, but is one no longer.
Thus the subsumption model shows a clear design prob-
lem: a class having time-dependent characteristics, namely
portal:Student, has been placed in the same is-a hierarchy
(i.e., defined through a rdfs:subClassOf relation) as a class

2Portal Ontology: http://www.aktors.org/ontology/portal.
The prefix portal refers to entities defined in it.

having time-independent characteristics, namely portal:Person.
As suggested in [7], which calls them respectively anti-rigid
andrigid classes, we believe they should be part of two separated hierarchies, and we conclude that descriptions of timedependant entities cannot be satisfactorily achieved using
plain subsumption.
2.2 Property links

A solution that properly takes into account anti-rigid characteristics is the use of a specific property for defining each
time-dependent value that an entity has (e.g., the role of a
person), while continuing to express the entity itself as an
individual of a particular class (e.g. a document). Many ontologies for describing bibliographic resources, such as DCTerms [6] and BIBO [5], use object properties to model this,
linking the document to the persons who are its authors by
the use of a specific property (namely, dcterms:creator and
bibo:authorList, respectively), as shown here:

# Using DCTerms
: paper1 a dcterms : B i b l i o g r a p h i c R e s o u r c e
; dcterms : creator : peroni , : vitali .
: paper2 a dcterms : B i b l i o g r a p h i c R e s o u r c e

; dcterms : creator

: peroni , : motta , : daquin .

# Using BIBO
: paper1 a bibo : Article

; bibo : a u t h o r L i s t ( : peroni , : vitali ) .

: paper2 a bibo : Article

; bibo : a u t h o r L i s t

( : peroni , : motta , : daquin ) .

This approach has at least two problems. The first is
that we need as many properties as there are roles. Thus if
the requirements are not fully known in advance or change
with time, the TBox of the ontology will require extensions
to include new properties on a case-by-case basis, requiring
continuous maintenance and increasing the risk of inconsis-
tencies. For instance, the number of roles in the publishing
domain (author, editor, publisher, etc.) has been continually increasing (see, for example, the list of MARC relators3
dated 7th December 2010), and the current technological
and cultural evolution will surely lead to the creation of
new ones (for instance, any time now, that of linked-data
manager).

Alternatively, one could use data properties rather than
object properties. For instance, the W3C specification of the
ontology for describing vCard objects in RDF [11] prescribes
the use of a (very general) data property, vcard:role, for an
individuals roles. But while this allows easy extensions to
the ontology by adding arbitrary literals to represent new
roles, it also lacks a clear and well-defined vocabulary for
existing ones, causing potential ambiguities (e.g., with the
literals Graduate student and Ph.D. student being used
to refer to the same role but being formally different within
the model).

A second problem, that affects the scenario regardless
of whether we use object properties or data properties, is
to discern the context in which an entity-value association
holds. For instance, consider an author having different institutional affiliations in the context of different publications
(e.g., because he/she moved from one to the other). Using

                                                10the Semantic Web Conference Ontology4 [14], we can define
affiliations for :peroni as follows:

about time. By adding this using a specific model, such as
the Time ontology6 [10], we manage to describe it as follows:

: peroni swrc : a f f i l i a t i o n : cs - unibo . # Paper 1
: cs - unibo a foaf : O r g a n i z a t i o n

; dcterms : d e s c r i p t i o n

" CS Dept . , U n i v e r s i t y of Bologna " .

: peroni swrc : a f f i l i a t i o n : kmi . # Paper 2
: kmi a foaf : O r g a n i z a t i o n

; dcterms : d e s c r i p t i o n

" KMi , Open U n i v e r s i t y " .

This specification, although straightforward, does not differentiate between associations. Namely, in OWL author
:peroni, is associated indifferently to both :cs-unibo and :kmi,
and it is not possible to determine the affiliation of an author
within the context of a particular paper  e.g., give me the
institutional affiliation of the person :peroni as author of paper 2 (although in [13] Masolo et al. propose an approach
to deal with this issue by using qua-individuals). Finally,
the approach proposed in CIDOC CRM allows one to use
the meta-property P14.1 in the role of [4] (a sub-property
of property P14 carried out by) so as to specify the role
that an agent has in the context of a particular event (such
as being affiliated to an institution) through an instance of
the class E55 Type. However, the official RDFS ontology of
CIDOC CRM5 does not implement any meta-property, and
in reality RDF lacks the expressive power needed to define
meta-properties.
2.3 Using inter-linked classes

Another way to address the time-dependent association of
entities to values is to consider both as classes (with no declared or inferable subsumption), and to link them through
object properties. For instance, the Semantic Web Conference Ontology [14] implements this through two classes,
foaf:Person and swc:Role, and the property swc:holdsRole
linking them.

The extensibility of the ontology is thus guaranteed, reducing the possibility of undesirable inferential side effects.
In fact, adding new roles simply involves adding new individuals to the class swc:Role, requiring no modification to
the TBox. However, as before, this solution is still unable
to describe the context or time frame in which the person
holds the particular role. For instance, Silvio Peroni was an
undergraduate student at the University of Bologna between
2005 and 2008, a graduate student at the same university
between 2009 and 2012, and also an intern at the University
of Oxford in 2010.

The SWC ontology, used together with FOAF [3], gives

only a partial description of this, as in the following:

: u n d e r g r a d u a t e S t u d e n t a swc : Role .
: g r a d u a t e S t u d e n t a swc : Role .
: intern a swc : Role .
: peroni a foaf : Person

; swc : h o l d s R o l e : u n d e r g r a d u a t e S t u d e n t

, : g r a d u a t e S t u d e n t , : intern .

This description cannot answer the question Was :peroni
a graduate student in 2008?, because it lacks information

; time : hasEnd [ a time : Instant

; time : i n D a t e T i m e [

; time : year "2008" ] ] ] . ...

The problem here is that time-related information is associated to the roles, rather than to the person holding them.
Being an undergraduate student is associated to the 20052008 time interval. This of course creates problems once we
add another person with the same role, since it will become
impossible to reuse the same role unless he/she also happens
to have been an undergraduate in the same years. Things
becomes even more complicated if we need also to describe
the social or cultural context within which the agent-role relation holds, for example, by specifying in which institution
:peroni was an intern on a given date. It would force one
to multiply the instances of role by the number of contexts
and time intervals for which the different roles are relevant.
3. TIME-INDEXED SITUATIONS

Some ontological patterns [1, 9, 15] have been developed
that partially address these issues. For example, through the
time-indexed situation pattern7, shown in Fig. 18, it becomes
possible to link a subject to a time-dependent description of
a situation9.

; tisit : f o r E n t i t y : oxac , : intern .

Although this pattern correctly describes our scenario, it
is still too abstract, both as a model and in terms of its ter-
minology. In particular, the tisit:forEntity object property
provides little or no guidance as to the interpretation of the
relation with the entity. In fact, for instance in :peroniAs-
InternInOxAc, the way the various entities were involved in
the situation is not clear, and we do not know what are the
relations linking :peroni, :oxac and :intern. Given that, we
could come to different conclusions just permuting the entities involved, e.g., a) that the person :peroni related at a
particular period to the institution :oxac that has the role
of :intern (quite incorrect), or b) that the person :peroni
worked at a particular period with somebody having the
role of :intern within the institution :oxac (still incorrect),
or c) that the person :peroni has the role :intern within the
institution :oxac during a particular period (as intended, fi-
nally). Thus, using this pattern we would need to apply
additional (unwarranted and smart) steps to infer the correct interpretation of the situation.

To resolve this ambiguity, we decided to extend this pattern so as to specify the relations held by individuals in a
situation involving a time-indexed value in a context.

4. TIME-INDEXED VALUE IN CONTEXT
What emerges from the preceding discussion is the needs
for a model to describe time-dependant and contextualised
entities.
In particular, we identified four different things
involved in these kinds of scenarios:

1. the entity having some value, e.g. a person or a docu-

ment possessing a role or a status;

2. the value had by someone, e.g. a role or a status;

3. the time period during which the entity has that value,

e.g. from April 2008 to September 2008;

4. the particular context that characterises the act of having that value, e.g. being a member of an institution
or the editor of a particular journal.

In Section 3 we introduced a pattern that is able to describe this scenario at an abstract level but missing a mechanism to describe the reciprocal relations of the entities in-
volved. Using that as a starting point, we now wish to define

a new ontological pattern called time-indexed value in context (TVC), summarised in Fig. 2 and available as an OWL
ontology10.

Figure 2: The Graffoo diagram of the time-indexed
value in context ontological pattern.

This pattern is composed by two different classes and four

object properties:

 the class ValueInTime is a particular kind of timeindexed situation (i.e. a subclass of tisit:TimeIndexed-
Situation) as shown in Section 3 that represents a hub
linking the entity having a particular value, the value
itself and the temporal and contextual extents on which
the entity-value relationship depends;

 the object property hasValue (sub-property of tisit:has-
TimeIndexedSetting) links an entity (e.g., a Person) to
a particular ValueInTime situation;

 the object property withValue (sub-property of tisit:for-
Entity) gives the value held by the entity taking part
inthe situation;

 the classes Instant and Interval are used, respectively,
to specify the particular temporal instant or time period in which the situation takes place. This is done
through the object property atTime, which is not defined as a sub-property of tisit:atTime since it can be
used to describe instants in addition to intervals;

 the object property withinContext (sub-property of ti-
sit:forEntity) links to the specific social, cultural or
physical context within which the fact of the entityhaving the valueis relevant.

Using the TVC ontology, the :peroniAsInternInOxAc excerpt introduced in the previous section can be re-written
as follows:

: peroni tvc : h a s V a l u e : p e r o n i A s I n t e r n I n O x A C .
: p e r o n i A s I n t e r n I n O x A c

during that particular time period, and :oxac is the con-
text.
In the following sections we expand these concepts,
introducing use cases and explaining the benefits of TVC.
4.1 Querying a TVC-based model via SPARQL
In principle, the TVC pattern allows a large number of
SPARQL 1.1 queries [8] to return intuitively correct answers.
In this section, we discuss as examples three queries of increasing difficulty. For instance, we can ask for all the values
had by a person (e.g., the roles held by :peroni):

SELECT D I S T I N C T ? value WHERE {

: peroni a foaf : Person

; tvc : h a s V a l u e / tvc : w i t h V a l u e ? value }

This query can be refined to consider, for instance, only
those values that are defined in a particular context, e.g. the
University of Bologna (entity :unibo):

SELECT D I S T I N C T ? value WHERE {

: peroni a foaf : Person

; tvc : h a s V a l u e [ a tvc : V a l u e I n T i m e

; tvc : w i t h V a l u e ? value
; tvc : w i t h i n C o n t e x t : unibo ] }

This will return both the undergraduate and the graduate
student roles of :peroni. We can further filter the previous
results to return just those roles that are applicable at a
particular date such as 24 August 2010:

SELECT D I S T I N C T ? value WHERE {

: peroni a foaf : Person

; tvc : h a s V a l u e [ a tvc : V a l u e I n T i m e

; tvc : w i t h V a l u e ? value
; tvc : w i t h i n C o n t e x t : unibo
; tvc : atTime [ a ti : T i m e I n t e r v a l

; ti : h a s I n t e r v a l S t a r t D a t e ? start
; ti : h a s I n t e r v a l E n d D a t e ? end ] ]

FILTER (

xsd : d a t e T i m e (? start )

<= "2010 -08 -24 T00 :00:00 Z " &&

: person3 tvc : h a s V a l u e [ a tvc : V a l u e I n T i m e
; tvc : w i t h V a l u e portal : PhD - Student ] .

# S t a t e m e n t s defined in the Portal O n t o l o g y
portal : Student rdfs : s u b C l a s s O f

portal : Affiliated - Person .

portal : PhD - Student rdfs : s u b C l a s s O f

portal : Student .

In this way, it is possible to query the dataset through
SPARQL, asking for all the people affiliated with the University of Bologna (the entity :unibo), independently from
the roles they may hold as a student, a Ph.D. student, or
other subclass of portal:Affiliated-Person:

SELECT D I S T I N C T ? person WHERE {

? person tvc : h a s V a l u e [ a tvc : V a l u e I n T i m e

; tvc : w i t h V a l u e ? aff
; tvc : w i t h i n C o n t e x t : unibo ] .

{ SELECT ? aff WHERE {

{ ? aff a owl : Class .

FILTER (? aff = portal : Affiliated - Person ) }

{ ? aff rdfs : s u b C l a s s O f +

portal : Affiliated - Person } } } }

TVC makes it possible and useful to reuse specific parts of
other ontologies describing categories in the form of classes,
thus taking advantages of the OWL 2 punning.
4.3 Constructing second-order inferences

Of course, it is sometimes desirable to reuse ontologies
that specify categories (e.g., roles) through properties rather
than classes, as introduced in Section 2.2. Consider, for ex-
ample, BIBO [5], that associates agent roles with documents
through particular sub-properties (e.g., bibo:translator, bi-
bo:director, bibo:editor) of the general property dcterms:con-
tributor. Using the BIBO ontology with TVC, these object
properties can be used as objects of tvc:withValue asser-
tions, by means of OWL 2 punning. Moreover, it is possible to construct second-order inferences using the objects
of tvc:withValue assertions as properties:

xsd : d a t e T i m e (? end ) > "2010 -08 -25 T00 :00:00 Z "

C O N S T R U C T { ? doc ? p r o p e r t y ? person } WHERE {

) }

This will return just the role of graduate student. If the
condition tvc:withinContext :unibo was omitted, the query
would return both :peronis role as a graduate student at the
University of Bologna, and his concurrent role on that date
as an intern at the University of Oxford. More complicated
and domain-specific queries are introduced in Section 5.1.
4.2 Reusing external classes as values

It is possible, by means of the meta-modelling features
of OWL 2 (i.e., OWL punning), to define classes of external ontologies as objects of tvc:withValue assertions. In this
way, we can use them interchangeably either as instances,
when we want to directly associate them with some entity,
or as classes when we want to understand hierarchical relationships between them. In addition to opening up the TVC
ontology for reuse, this may be very useful for inferring new
data for specific categories, even when, in a query, we use
their more abstract generalisations (i.e., superclasses).

Consider for example the following dataset defined according to TVC and including entities from the Portal Ontology:

: person1 tvc : h a s V a l u e [ a tvc : V a l u e I n T i m e

; tvc : w i t h V a l u e portal : Affiliated - Person ] .

: person2 tvc : h a s V a l u e [ a tvc : V a l u e I n T i m e

; tvc : w i t h V a l u e portal : Student ] .

? person a foaf : Person

; tvc : h a s V a l u e [ a tvc : V a l u e I n T i m e

; tvc : w i t h V a l u e ? p r o p e r t y
; tvc : w i t h i n C o n t e x t ? doc ]

{ SELECT ? p r o p e r t y WHERE {

{ ? p r o p e r t y a owl : O b j e c t P r o p e r t y .

FILTER (? aff = dcterms : c o n t r i b u t o r ) } UNION

{ ? p r o p e r t y rdfs : s u b P r o p e r t y O f +

dcterms : c o n t r i b u t o r } } } }

Through a model that combines TVC and an ontology
defining categories as property links, such as BIBO, it becomes feasible to infer second-order logical statements. More
generally, TVC can be used as an intermediate model for the
conversion of entity-value relationships from one ontology
into another, independent of the particular design technique
used by each ontology (i.e., class subsumptions, property
links, inter-linked classes or n-ary relationships).
5. USE OF TVC IN SPAR ONTOLOGIES

The pattern TVC is a fundamental ingredient of the Publishing Roles Ontology (PRO) and the Publishing Status Ontology (PSO) that we developed to describe roles and statuses in the publishing domain. TVC made their design
process simple and quick. In the following subsections we
introduce these ontologies, showing how they are integrated
with the TVC pattern.

                                                135.1 Identifying publishing roles with PRO

The ability to define publishing roles in SPAR was crucial
for the completeness of this suite of ontologies. The problems associated with the adoption of external ontologies to
handle this particular requirement has been discussed above.
None of them were fully able to satisfy the modelling requirements imposed by SPAR, particularly need for ease of
extendibility and for the simultaneous representation of time
periods and contexts.

Using TVC as the basis, we implemented PRO, the Publishing Roles Ontology11. This ontology, shown in Fig. 3,
permits characterization of the roles of agents  people, corporate bodies and computational agents  in the publication
process. It permits one to specify the role an agent has in relation to a particular bibliographic entity (as author, editor,
reviewer, etc.) or to a specific institution (as publisher, li-
brarian, etc.), and the period during which each role is held.

Figure 3: Graffoo representation of the Publishing
Roles Ontology (PRO).

Using PRO and its TVC-compliant structured as illustrated in Table 1, it is possible to describe all the scenarios
discussed in Section 2.2 and Section 2.3, as follows:

: peroni pro : h o l d s R o l e I n T i m e

# as author of two d i f f e r e n t papers
[ a pro : R o l e I n T i m e

and thus answer complex queries, such as the previously

; pro : r e l a t e s T o O r g a n i z a t i o n ? aff ] }

5.2 Specifying document statuses with PSO

The second subdomain of publishing handled in SPAR
and based on the TVC pattern is that of the status of doc-
uments.
In this case, the entity is a document holding a

                                                14particular status at a certain time as a direct consequence
of a particular event. For instance, a document is under
review until all reviewers send in their comments and the
editor decides whether to accept or reject the paper. After
the acceptance/rejection decision is made, the status under
review is no longer valid: this should be formally describable using an appropriate ontology. Moreover, it is sometimes useful to link documents to the decisions or events
that cause the acquisition or loss of a particular status.

Pre-existing ontologies describing the status of documents
(e.g., BIBO [5], the Project Documents Ontology12 [19]) and
the Document Status Ontology13) rely for this on specific
property links. As discussed in Section 2.2, this approach
prevents proper descriptions of scenarios that involve a temporal duration for each status. With the exception of the
Document Status Ontology, which describes status changes
as events, the other ontologies cannot allow time-dependent
data, or can do so only partially.

In order to address these issues in a more satisfactory man-
ner, we developed PSO, the Publishing Status Ontology14.
This ontology (shown in Fig. 4) characterises the publication
status of a document or any other publication entity at each
of the various stages in the publishing process (e.g. draft,
submitted, under review, rejected for publication, accepted
for publication, version of record, peer reviewed, open ac-
cess, etc.). As with PRO, PSO was developed following the
TVC pattern, as shown in Table 2. Using PSO, it is possible
to describe the statuses of documents and how they change
over time. For instance, consider the following description:

The paper :earmark-paper was submitted to DocEng 2009 on 24 April 2009 at 13:18. At noon
on 26 April, when the authors received acknowledgement of safe receipt of the paper from the
conference editorial committee, the paper was
considered under review until 27 May at 17:38.

Status Ontology (PSO).

Ontol-

the

Publishing

Status

Time changes everything. Linked Data describing humans
acting in specific roles or things processed in phases would be
considerably improved by using time-based specifications for
the roles and statuses of these humans and things. In this paper we introduced two ontologies, the Publishing Roles Ontology and the Publishing Status Ontology, that are part of
the Semantic Publishing and Referencing ontology set. We
illustrated how they provide lightweight and easy integration
of time-related features such as time- and context-dependent
roles and statuses by implementing the time-indexed value
in context (TVC), the ontological pattern proposed in this
paper to deal with temporal and contextual issues. The use
of the TVC pattern provides PRO and PSO with a model
that overcomes most of the limitations in expressivity and
conceptual errors that we found in the other formalizations
we have reviewed (including well-known ontologies such as
SWC and BIBO). The TVC pattern adopted in PRO and
PSO can easily be applied in other contexts.
In the fu-
ture, we plan to study integration paths between other wellknown ontologies and time- and context-dependent features
as made possible through this pattern.
