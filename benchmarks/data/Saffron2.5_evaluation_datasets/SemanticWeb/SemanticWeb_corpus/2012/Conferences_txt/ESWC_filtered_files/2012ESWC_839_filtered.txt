Abstract. Nowadays, it is very often to integrate existing ontologies,
combining them in a ontology network to accomplish the requirements
of more complex applications. This PhD research1 aims to identify and
formally define the relationships among the networked ontologies, addressing its use in real applications and taking care of their consistency.

Keywords: ontology network, ontology relationships formalization, logical consistency.

1 Motivation and Research Questions

Nowadays, autonomously developed ontologies in different domains (health,
learning) are used together in complex applications. However, how they are
combined is usually hidden in the application code. This situation leads to think
on ontology networks as a new engineering concept, which explicitly expresses
how ontologies are combined. Let suppose a scenario involving several domains,
such as a web resource recommender system (Figure 1). The Resources domain
describes web contents queried by users, the Quality domain, the quality assessment process of web resources, the User Context domain, the user profile and
context and the Criteria Selection domain, the criteria used to recommend a
given resource to a user. In this example, the relationship between Quality and

Resources domains appears since in this case study, web resources are assessed
according to some quality criteria. Then, it is important to explicitly specify not
only the semantics of each domain, but moreover adding knowledge about how

these domains are related. The main motivation of this thesis is the identification
and formal definition of the different relationships among ontologies, to describe
a particular application, keeping the logical consistency. That is, there should
not be an axiom of an ontology that causes contradictory results over another
ontology in an ontology network. In a real application, the ontology network
consistency could be computationally hard to be checked, then, the trade-off between keeping the consistency and taking care of the computational properties,
is one of the main issues of this work. The main contribution will be to facilitate developers in the design of ontology networks, expliciting how ontologies
can be linked, keeping them as independent components. In the remainder of
this paper: Section 2 gives a background overview, Section 3 explains the PhD
approach, Section 4 introduces methodology issues and Section 5 presents the
work already done.

2 State of the Art

According to the presented motivation, I take as starting point the work of
Allocca et al. [1], who identify and define general relations between ontologies,
such as includedIn and equivalentTo, describing them in the DOOR ontology.
Grau et al. [2] define an   connection as a set of connected ontologies,
introducing link properties, which connect two ontologies. The semantic of these
properties is like the useSymbolsOf relationship, defined in the PhD work. I
also based my study in a more recent work of Grau et al. [3], which adapts the
notions of module and black-box behavior, to the reuse of ontologies. Konev et al.
[4] analize the same concepts and others such as robustness of a query language,
based on the concept of inseparability of ontologies. These two works [3,4] also
analise the computational complexity issue for Description Logics (DL) with
different expressivity, so, I am taking advantage of their results.

The work of Borgida et. al [5] defines directional links between ontologies, called
bridge rules and the concept of distributed T-box, DL T-boxes connected through
bridge rules. The bridge rules capture the idea of linking ontologies through subsumption as well as more general relationships, while my work intends to clearly
distinguish different ways of connecting ontologies, to make them explicit.

Giunchiglia et al. [6] define the concept of abstraction without relating it to
ontologies. However, I take this idea to define the isTheSchemaFor relationship.
There also exist works that define the ontology mapping between concepts,

roles and instances [7,8], taken to formalize the relationship mapsSymbolsTo.

3 The Proposed Approach

I have formalized a set of ontology relationships, which allowed me to design
ontology networks for some case studies. For these case studies, this set of relationships was adecuate to explicitly express the links among the different domain
ontologies. Next, I give an intuitive description of each ontology relationship.

isAConsistentExtensionOf : describes an extension of an ontology by a number

of additional axioms.

isTheSchemaFor : keeps the link between a model and its meta-model.
In the web resource recommender system introduced in Section 1, the Resources domain is composed by three ontologies, illustrated in Figure 2 in a
simplified version. The main concepts of the WebSite Specification ontology are

Fig. 2. Resources and Quality domains

WebResource and WebResourceProperty. A web resource is any resource identified by an URL, for instance a webpage. A web resource property models
the properties of a web resource, for instance, hasContent and hasAuthor. The
WebSite ontology has as main concepts: WebContent, WebPage and WebSite.
The WebSite Specialization ontology adds properties to these concepts, such as
hasAuthor and hasSource. In the Resources domain the isTheSchemaFor relationship links some ontologies. The WebSite Specification ontology is the metamodel for the Website and WebSite Specialization ontologies, since the concepts
and relations of these ontologies are instances of WebResource and WebResourceProperty concepts.

The Quality domain is composed by three ontologies: Metric Specification, Quality Specification and Quality Assessment. They conceptualize metrics, quality assurance specifications and quality assessments. Figure 2 shows a simplified ver-
sion. Some of these ontologies are related to ontologies of the Resources domain.
The mapSymbolsTo relationship links the Quality Assessment and WebSite on-
tologies, through an alignment of the Resource and WebContent concepts. This
relationship is also used between Metric Specification and WebSite Specification
ontologies, mapping the Feature and WebResourceProperty concepts, to specify
that a metric is based on some web resource property. Here, it is clear the convenience of having some ontologies that play the role of metamodel for others.
In the formalization of the ontology relationships I consider the language
QL, which is the selected DL with the adequate expressivity for the application

to be described. That is, besides the knowledge represented by each ontology, I
consider the expressivity required by the application, for the knowledge inference
of the ontology network. For a case study, maybe it is enough a DL, for example
ALC, and not a more expressive DL like ALCQ, computationally more expensive
[9,10]. I am addressing the study of the logical consistency of the ontology network
based on the concept of inseparability introduced by Konev et.al [4], w.r.t. this
language QL and I am starting to study the computational complexity of the
algorithms for checking the consistency. The results obtained will be analized
varying the DL expressivity of the QL, for the different relationships.

Although my work is inspired on [1], it is different since the main focus in [1] is
the detection and definition of ontology relationships in a large ontology reposi-
tory, while my focus is the identification and DL formalization of a set of ontology
relationships, enough to design an ontology network for a particular application.
This is done considering the logical consistency of the ontology network as well
as computational complexity issues. A tool to design ontology networks allowing
modelers to define different relationships, can benefit from the formalization.

4 Research Methodology

This work is being carried out following an iterative process. I started with the
analysis of case studies to identify ontology relationships. This led to investigate
the way other authors addressed this issue, reviewing theoretical foundations
about DL and computational complexity when necessary. As a result, a set of
relationship definitions is obtained, which is validated in a case study, and from
the weakenesses found a new iteration starts, refining the previous definitions.

Regarding the evaluation of the approach, the implementation of an application to design ontology networks is being carried out. It will allow to validate a
lot of important aspects: (i) its usability to define different relationships, reaching the adecuate abstraction level (ii) the evaluation of the user satisfaction when
the ontology network evolves. Here, it is important to know about the imposed
restrictions for ensuring the ontology network consistency: if they help at the
moment of introducing changes or they difficult the task in practice.

5 Results

I have formalized four ontology relationships, introduced in Section 3. A first
formalization and its use to describe a web recommender system was presented
in [11]. In the following, I present the usesSymbolsOf relationship.

These relationships have been adressed by different authors separately, not
always related to ontologies, some of them taking care of the logical consistency.
This work intend to uniformly address the definition of a set of ontology rela-
tionships, enough to describe a real application, ensuring its consistency without
neglecting complexity issues. I think this work will contribute to the definition
of a methodology to design ontology networks.
