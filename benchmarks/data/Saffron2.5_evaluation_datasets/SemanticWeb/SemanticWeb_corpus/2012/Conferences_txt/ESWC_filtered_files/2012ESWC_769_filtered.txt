Abstract. Existing metadata schemes and content management systems used by 
museums focus on describing the heritage objects that the museum holds in its 
collection.  These  are  used  to  manage  and  describe  individual  heritage  objects 
according  to  properties  such  as  artist,  date  and  preservation  requirements. 
Curatorial narratives, such as physical or online exhibitions tell a story that spans 
across heritage objects and have a meaning that does not necessarily reside in the 
individual heritage objects themselves. Here we present curate, an ontology for 
describing  curatorial  narratives.  This  draws  on  structuralist  accounts  that 
distinguish the narrative from the story and plot, and also a detailed analysis of 
two  museum  exhibitions  and the  curatorial  processes  that  contributed  to  them. 
storyspace, our web based interface and API to the ontology, is being used by 
curatorial staff in two museums to model curatorial narratives and the processes 
through which they are constructed. 

Keywords: Cultural heritage, story, plot, narrative, ontology, museum. 

Introduction 

Current  museum  metadata  schemes  and  content  management  systems  focus  on  the 
description and management of the individual heritage objects that the museum holds 
in its collection. An important responsibility for museums, as well as preserving the 
collection,  is  to  communicate  to  the  public.  One  key  form  of  communication  is 
through the development of curatorial narratives. These curatorial narratives may take 
the form of physical museum exhibitions (possibly supplemented by other materials 
such  as  audio  guides  and  booklets)  or  online  presentations.  Curatorial  narratives 
express  meaning  across  a  number  of  heritage  objects. The  meaning  of  the  narrative 
cannot be expressed or derived purely from the metadata of the heritage objects that it 
contains.  Currently,  there  is  therefore  no  support  for  the  description  and  search  of 
museum narratives based on their meaning rather than the objects that they contain. 

This  work  is  being  conducted  as  part  of  DECIPHER,  an  EU  Framework 
Programme 7 project in the area of Digital Libraries and Digital Preservation. A key 
aim of DECIPHER is to allow users interactively to assemble, visualize and explore, 
not just collections of heritage objects, but the knowledge structures that connect and 
give them meaning. As part of this work, the curate ontology has been developed in 
order that we can understand and describe the reasoning behind a curatorial narrative.

This  can  the  be  used  to  describe  and  search  of  narratives  based  on  their  meaning 
rather than just the heritage objects that they contain. The ontology will also be used 
to drive computational assistance for the human construction of narratives. 

The rest of this paper is structured as follows. The next  section describes related 
research in the formal description of events and its use in providing navigation across 
heritage  objects.  Section  3  describes  the  curate  ontology  and  how  it  can  be  used  to 
describe  curatorial  narratives.  It  draws  on  structuralist  theories  that  distinguish  the 
narrative  presentation  from  the  conceptualization  of  the  story  and  plot.  Section  4 
describes storyspace, an API and web interface to the ontology. Section 5 describes 
the  use  of  storyspace  to  model  curatorial  narratives  on  the  conceptual,  story  level. 
Section  6  summarises  the  findings  of  a  structured  interview  with  two  members  of 
museum curatorial staff that used storyspace to model curatorial narratives over a two 
month period. Section 7 presents conclusions and ongoing work. 

Related Work 

Although there has not been any previous attempt to develop an ontology of curatorial 
narrative,  some  previous  research  has  used  metadata  to  generate  or  describe 
presentations  that  include  multiple  heritage  objects.  These  have  made  use  of  eventbased ontologies and metadata schemes to conceptually interconnect heritage objects. 
Bletchley Park Text [1, 2] uses historical interviews described according to CIDOC 
CRM  [3]  event-based  metadata  to  assemble  an  online  newspaper  in  response  to  a 
query.  Interviews  are  grouped  according  to  the  common  people,  places  and  objects 
mentioned in their constituent events. Hyvonen et al. [4, 5] used event-based metadata 
to assemble further heritage objects around another that acted as a hub or backbone to 
the presentation. In one case a movie about the ceramics process was represented as 
events and linked to other resources related to concepts (e.g. people objects) featured 
in the events [5]. In the other, events were used to generate links within a poem and to 
external resources giving additional information [5]. 

Wang  et  al.  [6,  7]  use  content  metadata  and  user  preferences  to  suggest  related 
heritage objects of interest. van Hage et al. [8] combine this with a real-time routing 
system to provide a personalized museum tour guide creating a conceptual path across 
a  number  of  heritage  objects.  The  personalized  tour  guide  developed  by  Lim  and 
Aylett  [9]  associated  heritage  objects  with  a  metadata  structure  they  termed  a  story 
element  that  comprised  events,  people,  objects,  museum  location  and  causal 
relationships to other story elements. Recommendations were made based on casual 
relationships and shared items contained in story elements. 

Finally, van Erp et al. [10] describe a prototype system for event-driven browsing. The 
system  suggests  related  heritage  objects based on  their associated  events. By  selecting 
related heritage objects the user can create a pathway through the heritage objects. 

Research related to the interconnection of heritage objects based on event metadata 
has made use of a number of ways of formally representing events. CIDOC CRM is 
an upper level ontology for the cultural heritage sector [3]. CIDOC CRM affords an 
event-based  representation  of  metadata.  This  provides  a  way  of  representing  the 

P. Mulholland, A. Wolff, and T. Collins 

changing  properties  of  a  heritage  object  over  time  (for  example  the  changing 
ownership of a painting). Another particular advantage of the CIDOC CRM ontology 
is  that  it  facilitates  interoperability  among  museum  metadata  schemes.  Other 
approaches to the formal representation of events have been proposed such as LODE 
[11] and SEM [12]. These aim to limit ontological commitment in order to broaden 
the  range  of  events  that  can  be  represented  and  are  not  focused  specifically  on  the 
heritage domain.  

Other  work  has  looked  at  separating  the  interpretation  of  events  from  the 
representation of the events themselves. This simplifies the properties of the event and 
allows multiple (possibly conflicting) interpretations of the same event to be modeled, 
for example alternative perspectives on the cause-effect relationship between events. 
The Descriptions and Situations (DnS) ontology design pattern applied to events [13] 
supports this by distinguishing a situation (e.g. two events) from its description (e.g. 
cause-effect relationship between them). 

The Curate Ontology 

Development of the curate ontology drew on an analysis of the curatorial processes as 
conducted in museums. We analyzed in detail the curatorial processes involved in the 
development of two exhibitions held by museum partners in the DECIPHER project. 
The two exhibitions were Gabriel Metsu [14] held at the National Gallery of Ireland 
and The Moderns [15] held at the Irish Museum of Modern Art (IMMA). The Gabriel 
Mestu  exhibition  focused  on  the  work  of  a  single  artist.  The  Moderns  presented  an 
Irish perspective on Modernism in art and covered a range of artists from around 1900 
to 1970. The analysis involved visiting the exhibitions (in  the case of the Moderns) 
and  analysis  of  associated  resources  (e.g.  transcript  of  the  audio  guide,  museum 
panels, booklets). A one-day workshop was held focused on each exhibition. The first 
half of the workshop was devoted to presentations by staff involved in the curatorial 
process.  This  included  curators  of  the  physical  exhibition  and  others  involved  in 
interpretation and producing narratives around the exhibition such as staff working on 
the education programme. The second half was focussed on discussions motivated by 
scenarios and paper prototypes of what types of interaction could be envisaged from 
tools resulting from the project. Further details on the analysis of curatorial practice 
can be found elsewhere [16, 17]. 

This work produced a rich description of the curatorial process. In developing the 
ontology we proposed two working hypotheses to guide our interpretation of the data, 
and that could also be tested as part of the interpretation process. Our first hypothesis 
was that a curatorial narrative should have the generic properties found in other types 
of narrative such as a novel or a film. Structuralist theories can be used to distinguish 
story, plot and narrative [18]. The story is the set of events that can be told. The plot 
imposes a network of relationships on the events of the story signifying their roles and 
importance  in  the  overall  story  and  how  they  are  interrelated  (e.g.  a  causal 
relationship between two events). The plot therefore turns a chronology of events into 
a subjective interpretation of those events. The narrative is a particular telling of that 
story and plot in some particular media.

Fig. 1. Overview of the curate ontology 

P. Mulholland, A. Wolff, and T. Collins 

Second, we hypothesized that curatorial narratives are not only presentations but the 
product  of  a  process  of  inquiry  in  which  the  heritage  objects  provide  a  source  of 
evidence. Narrative inquiry [19] is a methodology in which research can be conducted 
by selecting or constructing a story of events, interpreting these by proposing and testing 
a  plot  and  then  presenting  this  as  a  narrative  to  the  research  community.  Narrative 
inquiry  can  be  contrasted  with  the  scientific  method  as  a  research  methodology.  In 
narrative  inquiry  the  plot  can  be  thought  of  as  essentially  a  hypothesis  that  is  tested 
against the story, being the data of the experiment. Story, plot and narrative therefore 
constitute a process rather than only associated types of description. 

These hypotheses, in combination with an iterative design process in participation 
with the two museums, led to the construction of the curate ontology1. An overview is 
shown in figure 1. CIDOC CRM [3] and DOLCE+DnS Ultralite (DUL)2 are used as 
upper  level  ontologies  for  curate.  There  are  five  main  components  to  the  ontology, 
indicated by the areas A to E in figure 1. These will be described in the following five 
subsections. 

3.1 

Story, Plot and Narrative 

Part  A  of  the  ontology  describes  the  concepts  of  story,  plot  and  narrative  and  how 
they are related (see figure 1). A narrative presents both a story and a plot. A story is 
interpreted by a plot. A number of plots may be created for the same story. In some 
cases a narrative may present a story but have no associated plot. This would indicate 
that the narrative is recounting a chonology of events (i.e. a chronicle) but offers no 
interpretation  of  them.  Figure  2  shows  the  relationship  between  a  story  of  Gabriel 
Metsu and an associated plot and story. The story itself contains events. The events of 
a story will be considered further in section 3.3.

3.2 

Stories and Heritage Objects 

The  relationship  between  heritage  objects  and  the  story,  plot  and  narrative  is 
illustrated in part B of figure 1. Discussions with museum partners made clear that we 
needed to distinguish two types of narrative. A heritage object narrative tells a story

about  a  heritage  object.  A  heritage  object  may  have  multiple  heritage  object 
narratives.  These  heritage  object  narratives  may  draw  on  different  aspects  of  the 
heritage object such as how the object was created, some insight it gives about the life 
of the artist, what is depicted in the heritage object or who has owned it. A curatorial 
narrative threads across a  number of  heritage object narratives. It  makes conceptual 
relationships  across  a  set  of  exhibits,  yielding  more  complex  insights  than  could  be 
made from the exhibits individually. 

This  approach  to  modeling  has  two  advantages.  First,  it  allows  us  to  distinguish 
alternative stories of the same heritage object. Second it allows us to model, through 
the  heritage  object  story,  what  contribution  a  heritage  object  brings  to  a  curatorial 
story.  The  relationship  between  a  heritage  object  and  an  event,  mediated  by  the 
heritage object story, plays the role of the illustrate property  in the LODE ontology 
[11] that associates an object with an event. The mediating role of the heritage object 
story though allows us to represent through  which story the event is associated with 
the object. 

Figure  3  shows  two  heritage  object  stories  of  the  painting  A  Woman  Reading  a 
Letter. One is concerned with how the painting illustrates the brush technique of the 
artist.  The  other  is  concerned  with  a  more  recent  incident  in  which  the  painting  was 
stolen and recovered. The story about brush technique is relevant to the curatorial story. 
The  curatorial  story  shows  how  Metsus  technique  changed  over  time,  drawing  on  a 
number of heritage object stories illustrating technique at a particular point in time.

Facets, Events and Event Descriptions 

The relationship of stories to events and their description within a story is represented 
in part C of figure 1. An event included in a story has an associated event description. 
This  describes  the  event  according  to  the  facets  of  the  story.  The  facets  are 
dimensions  according  to  which  the  event  can  be  described.  Following  [11],  this 
interpretation of an event in the context of a story is modeled as a DUL:Situation, the 
story itself constituting a DUL:Description. From a narrative inquiry perspective [19] 
this allows us to  move  from  a chronicle, a set of events that just have a position in 
time, to what is called a storyline. A storyline also describes the events in other ways 
relevant  to  the  investigation.  For  example,  if  changing  patterns  in  the  location  of 
events over time  was of interest then location  would be a facet of the story  used to 
describe  the  events.  Similarly,  if  the  investigation  was  considering  the  incidence  of 
certain types of activity then activity type of the event would be a facet of the story. 

P. Mulholland, A. Wolff, and T. Collins 

This  type  of  organization  was  identified  in  the  exhibitions  and  recognized  as  a 
general organizational principle by curatorial staff. In the case of Gabriel Metsu, the 
first  part  of  the  exhibition  illustrated  the  development  of  his  technique  early  in  his 
career.  Here,  time  was  the  primary  organizing  principle.  In  the  later  components  of 
the exhibition, which focus on when his technique has fully developed, organization 
was  thematic,  indicating  whether  the  work  was  related  to,  for  example,  family, 
reputation or religion. 

Figure 4 shows the association of an event with the theme of religion. Within the 
context  of  this  story,  the  event  has  an  event  description.  The  event  description  has 
event description elements that assign one or more values for a defined facet of the 
story. The event description is used to reify the  interpretative elements of the event 
description.

Plots, Events and Story Components 

The emplotment of a story (i.e. its association with a plot) is represented in part D of 
figure  1.  The  approach  taken  to  modeling  plot  makes  use  of  the  Descriptions  and 
Situations (DnS) pattern applied to events [13]. The ontology supports the definition of 
plot  relationships  across  events,  story  components  or  both.  For  example,  a  plot 
relationship  may  define  that  one  event  causes  another.  In  practice,  the  relationships 
found between events tend to be subtler, for example the specification of an influence 
between events. This is not only a feature of curatorial narratives. For example, in an 
analysis of novels, Chatman [20] highlights happenings that have no cause within the 
narrative. Similarly, plot relationships may be specified between story components (e.g. 
this area in space and time is more peaceful than another) or between both events and 
story components (e.g. this event was pivotal between two areas in space and time). 

Figure 5 shows an example in which one event (Metsu drew Sketch of a female 
figure) is classified as being preparatory for another event. As in the DnS ontology 
design pattern a justification can be added in support of the defined relationship. Here, 
visual similarity is used to justify the proposed plot relationship.

3.5  Narrative Components 

The narrative presentation of a story and plot is represented in part E of figure 1. This 
also makes use of the Descriptions and Situations (DnS) pattern to specify structural 
relationships  between  components  of  the  narrative.  A  curatorial  narrative  within  a 
physical  museum  space  may  vary  considerably  from  the  underling  story  due  to 
different  types  of  physical  constraint.  First,  differences  may  be  due  to  the  fixed 
structure of the museum space. For example, the exhibition space at IMMA is made 
up  of  a  number  of  relatively  small  rooms  and  interconnecting  doors  and  corridors. 
This can result in a story component spanning a number of physical spaces, with the 
organization of heritage objects and interpretation panels across those spaces being as 
much determined by aesthetic and size constraints as the conceptual organization of 
the story.

Some  differences  between  story  and  narrative  organization  may  result  from 
preservation  constraints  of  the  exhibits.  For  example,  pencil  sketches  need  to  be 
displayed in darker conditions than are used for displaying paintings, therefore need 
to be separated in a physical museum space though not on the conceptual space of the 
story. Figure 6 represents this example in which a narrative has been broken down in 
order to separate components for preservation reasons. 

Storyspace 

Storyspace is an API to the curate ontology and currently a web interface to the story 
and  heritage  object  components  of  the  ontology  (i.e.  sections  B  and  C  of  figure  1). 
The decision was taken to develop a web interface in order that museum participants 
in  the  design  process  could  try  to  model  aspects  of  curatorial  narratives  for 
themselves, understand the implications of the ontology and provide feedback on both 
the  ontology  and  web  interface. The  web  interface  was  developed  using  the  Drupal 
CMS3. In Drupal, pieces of content (which may be rendered as a whole or part of a 
web page) are represented as nodes. A Drupal node is of a node type that defines the 
content  fields  of  the  node.  For  example,  a  node  type  for  representing  film  reviews 
may have fields for the film title, a textual review of the film and integer representing 
a rating of the film. Corlosquet et al. [21] drew on the parallel between Drupal content 
type, fields and nodes and the classes, properties and individuals of an ontology and 
knowledge  base.  They  developed  support  for  Drupal  content  to  be  published 
semantically according to this mapping. 

Building on this idea we developed a set of Drupal content types for representing 
the story and heritage object parts of the curate ontology. The content types developed 
were: story, event, facet, heritage object, data and reference. The story content type is 
used  to  represent  both  heritage  object  and  curatorial  stories.  The  reference  content 
type does not map to the curate ontology and represents a bibliographic source for a 
curatorial or heritage object story. This was added at the request of the museums and 
can  be  represented  formally  using  existing  bibliographic  ontologies  such  as  BIBO4. 
The data content type represents additional metadata associated with an individual of 
the curate ontology represented in storyspace. For example this is used to represent 
additional  metadata  associated  with  an  event  imported  into  storyspace.  An 
rdfs:seeAlso property is defined between the entity (e.g. the event) and the additional 
metadata. 

Storyspace  required  a  slightly  more  flexible  mapping  to  the  ontology  than 
demonstrated  by  Corlosquet  [21]  as,  for  example,  heritage  object  and  curatorial 
stories and their components are all represented by the same Drupal content type but 
map  to  different  classes  in  the  ontology.  A  Drupal  module  was  developed  in 
storyspace to allow the rdf:type of a node to be defined according to any combination 
of  fields  and  values  of  the  Drupal  node.  A  formal  description  of  the  storyspace

content is held in a Sesame5 triple store using the ARC2 library6. The ontology API is 
tied  to  the  creation,  update  and  deletion  functions  of  the  Drupal  nodes  and  can  be 
triggered  programmatically  or  via  the  web-based  user  interface.  Also,  similar  to 
Corlosquet et al. [21], appending rdfxml to a Drupal path presents the metadata of the 
node.  Storyspace  also  makes  use  of  Simile  Exhibit7  to  allow  the  user  to  visualize 
events  of  the  story  according  to  selected  facets.  The  next  section  describes  how 
storyspace  has  been  used  by  curatorial  staff  at  the  museums  to  model  curatorial 
stories.  For  this  exercise  the  curatorial  staff  took  the  two  exhibitions  that  had  been 
studied  previously  (The  Moderns  and  Gabriel  Metsu)  and  modeled  the  underlying 
story  of  the  exhibitions  and  related  resources.  The  longer  term  intended  use  for 
storyspace is to model a future exhibition and use it in working toward the narrative 
presentation. However, the reverse engineering of the stories from the final narratives 
provided a good test case and access to a number of existing resources that could be 
managed in storyspace. 

5  Modeling Stories with Storyspace 

Although  storyspace  is  being  used  to  model  a  number  of  classes  within  the  curate 
ontology  (e.g.  storyspace,  heritage  object,  facet,  event,  event  description)  in  the 
interface  we  chose  to  emphasise  the  story  and  subjugate  the  role  of  the  other 
components  in  the  interface  as  elements  of  a  story.  In  the  primary  menu  (the  dark 
band toward to top of the screen in figure 7) curatorial and heritage object stories are 
therefore  represented  in  the  primary  menu  and  other  entities  are  accessible  either 
through the stories in which they are contained or through the Resources menu. 

In  figure  7  a  curatorial  story  has  been  selected  entitled  Our  collection:  IMMA 
publication  of  art  packs  for  children  aged  six  to  twelve  years  old.  In  the  left  hand 
menu  the  Drupal  fields  (i.e.  ontological  properties)  of  the  story  can  be  accessed. 
These  correspond  to  components  of  the  story,  the  events  it  contains,  its  facets, 
references  and  also  Simile  Exhibit  visualisations  that  can  be  used  to  visualize  the 
storys events according to its defined facets. 

Figure  7  is  showing  the  heritage  object  stories  of  a  curatorial  story  developed  to 
communicate  an  exhibition  to  schoolchildren.  The  heritage  object  stories  contain  a 
view  of  the  heritage  object  comprising  its  title  in  bold,  a  thumbnail  and  standard 
collection information. The heritage object may participate in multiple heritage object 
stories.  Each  of  these  heritage  object  stories  may  themselves  be  used  in  multiple 
curatorial stories. 

Figure 8 shows a list of the heritage object stories of a particular heritage object. 
This list is accessed by selecting Heritage Objects from the Resources menu, and then 
selecting the heritage object, in this case Sounion by Cecil King, and then selecting 
the Object stories for that heritage object from the left hand menu.

stories  that  had  been  told  related  to  a  heritage  object  and  the  curatorial  stories  in 
which they had been included. 

The  representation  of  events  within  a  story  was  found  to  be  more  difficult  with 
contemporary art as found in The Moderns exhibition. For the stories in the Gabriel 
Metsu exhibition and even the earlier parts of The Moderns exhibition, the events in 
the story were easier to identify. For the more recent  works (e.g. from the 1960s or 
1970s)  the  events  were  less  clear.  For  living  artists  and  in  situations  were  many 
sources of evidence are not in the public domain, a historical perspective is harder to 
establish and therefore key events of the story are harder to identify. 

For both exhibitions the most problematic concept was facet. These could be used to 
model various themes of the events but it was not always clear how best to model this. 
For example, a single theme facet could be defined with a number of possible values or 
it could be broken down into a number of facets each representing a sub-theme. 

A further issue discussed in the interviews was alternative nomenclature for some 
of the concepts, such as heritage object stories and facets, when used in storyspace by 
specific  audiences.  Although  the  concepts  were  found  to  enable  the  successful 
representation of  museum storytelling  there are no existing, generally  used terms in 
museum  practice  that  can  be  mapped  to  them.  The  option  of  specialized  labels  in 
storyspace for particular museum groups was discussed as a possible extension. This 
will be considered further during wider trials with museum staff. 

Conclusions and Future Work 

We have developed curate, an ontology for describing curatorial narratives. This draws 
on structuralist theories that distinguish story, plot and narrative. Storyspace has been 
developed  as  an  API  and  web  interface  to  the  ontology.  Two  exhibitions  and  their 
related stories have been used to motivate development of the ontology and also help 
validate it by modelling the stories using storyspace. Current work is focussed on using 
the curate ontology to provide assistance in the construction of curatorial narratives on 
each of the story, plot and narrative levels. On the story level, we are investigating how 
the author can be assisted in organising the story in terms of its components and their 
organising facets. On the plot level we are investigating how the plot descriptions can 
be suggested for a given story. Finally, on the narrative level, we looking at how the 
composition of the narrative structure can be suggested, given a story and plot.
