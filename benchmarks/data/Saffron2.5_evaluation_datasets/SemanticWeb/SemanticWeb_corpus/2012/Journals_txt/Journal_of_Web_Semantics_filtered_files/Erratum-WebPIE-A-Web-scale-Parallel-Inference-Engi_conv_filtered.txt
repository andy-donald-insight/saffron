The authors regret some errors, as follows.
On page 61, add, just before the header of Section 3.1: It is well
known that the RDFS closure is infinite, and we will describe how we
ignore some of the RDFS rules which produce either trivial results or
ignore derivations that are considered bad style. For similar reasons,
we do not add the RDFS axiomatic triples to the input data.
1. On page 64, the third antecedent of rule 14a of Table 3

is u p w.

2. On page 64, the head of the rule 14b of Table 3 is u p w.
3. On page 67, add, at the end of Section 6.1: In the latest version
of the code, the execution of OWL reasoning requires one more
job to finish because of an implementation bug of the incremental
reasoning procedure.

4. On page 68, in Table 8, the header of the the second column
should be Input size (millions). The header of the third column
should be Throughput (Kpts). The value of the input for the
Bio2RDF dataset should be 24000 and not 24. Also, notice that
the throughput was calculated dividing the input size with the
runtime and not the output.

5. On page 69, the value on the y axis of Figure 6(a) should be

Runtime (minutes).

6. On page 69, Add a footnote after the second sentence of Section
6.5: Notice that in some case the implementation used for
the duplicate strategies threshold and end can lead to an
infinite loop. This can be prevented by simply forcing the
deletion after a fixed number of steps.

7. On page 72, add, at the end of the first paragraph of Appendix
A.1: As usual, our pseudocode omits details that are not essential
for human understanding of the algorithm, such as variable dec-
larations, datatypes and some subroutines (http://en.wikipedia.
org/wiki/Pseudocode).

8. On page 71, the first line of Section 8.2 should read RDFS/OWL

Horst instead of OWL Horst.

9. In Appendix A, Algorithm 3 (page 72) should read:

derived = apply_job(data,SUBPROP);

if (derived_special_cases_with_loop(derived) == true)
derived += rdfs_reasoning(data + derived);
return derived

10. In Appendix A, Algorithm 6 (page 73) lines 3 and 6 should out-

put value.subject instead of value.predicate.

11. In Appendix A (page 72), add, to the paragraph on SUBCLASS:
The pseudocode of Algorithm 6 does not mention the computation
of rules 12 and 13, because their execution is trivial.
12. In Appendix A, Algorithm 10 (page 74) should be:

map(key,edge):

emit(edge.from,edge.to);
emit(edge.to,edge.from);

reduce(key,values):

toNodes.empty(); // edges to other nodes
foundReplacement = false
for(value in values)

if (value < key)

if (foundReplacement)

toNodes.add(key);

foundReplacement = true;
key = value;

else if (value > key) toNodes.add(value);

for(to in toNodes)

emit(null,{key,to});
