ABSTRACT
In this paper, we describe the technical approach of and experiences gained in exposing a major share of the European
building and construction materials market on the basis of
the GoodRelations Web vocabulary for e-commerce. This allows for the fine-grained search for products, suppliers, and
warehouses for any building-related sourcing needs. Because
building materials show a very high item specificity, they
are very interesting for new types of search. Also, transportation costs for building materials are very significant,
which makes the distance from the warehouse to the point
of consumption a critical dimension of search. Based on existing data sources, we were able to include a rich, machinereadable description of individual product features using the
FreeClassOWL ontology, which allow for multi-dimensional
search. The result is one of the largest and richest public
datasets for a well-defined trade sector that is available on
the Semantic Web.

INTRODUCTION

Search and matchmaking between two business parties
over the current Web are still very time-consuming if (1)
the objects of the search are very specific; (2) multiple characteristics of these objects determine their relevance (e.g.
not just the price); (3) information from multiple sources
needs to be combined to assess the relevance or execute the
query; and (4) the locations of buyer, seller, warehouse, and
point of consumption matter.

One of the domains that aligns strongly with these four
characteristics is that of building and construction materi-
als. Because building materials tend to present several functional characteristics and show a very high item specificity
[10], they are very interesting for new types of search. Also,
transportation costs for building materials are very signifi-
cant, making the distance from the warehouse to the point
of consumption a critical dimension of search. Or what in
the context of Web search, is sometimes attributed to the
findability of a resource [13].

An important source of building and construction materials on the Web is the Eurobau portal1. As the creators and
administrators of the portal states2, Eurobau.com is a comprehensive internet portal for the commercial construction
industry, with 200,000 users/month. It compiles construction materials data from ten European countries, available
in eight languages, with Austria being one of the main contributors to the repository.

To facilitate browsing, navigation and integration of the
data, Eurobau employs an open source classification standard developed specifically for the building materials do-
main, known as FreeClass3 [4]. FreeClass provides a comprehensive range of categories aimed at covering all relevant attributes and application areas of building materi-
als. Thanks to the FreeClass classification standard and
a Web application, users of the Eurobau portal can browse
and explore all the available data. However, in its current
form, the data can only be viewed, accessed or searched
in a limited fashion. The most notable limitations include
for example (a) searching for building materials over more
than one FreeClass category (i.e., all materials in categories
14-15-10 insulation plaster and 14-15-20 restoration plas-
ter); (b) querying over all materials that meet a specific set
of attributes or requirements (i.e., all bricks whose width
is greater than 10 centimeters); (c) finding manufacturers
within certain distance because no geographical coordinates
(or geo-code) information is stored; or (d) the fact that data
can not be combined easily with other data repositories on
the Web.

In order to increase the applicability and reusability potential of the data hosted by the Eurobau portal, we describe in this paper the technical approach of and experiences gained in exposing this major share of the European
building and construction materials market on the basis
of the GoodRelations Web vocabulary for e-commerce [8].

                                               25Based on existing data resources, we were able to include
a rich, machine-readable description of individual product
features using the RDF data model, which allows for multidimensional and fine-grained search for products, suppliers,
and warehouses for any building-related sourcing needs. The
result is one of the largest and richest public RDF datasets
for a well-defined trade sector that is available on the Semantic Web, covering a major share of the respective European
market.

The work involved throughout this process has been carried out in the context of the BauDataWeb project, an initiative of the Research Promotion Agency (FFG)4 of the
Austrian Government, to bring together academic research
and industry. The most significant components involved are
summarized on the project overview site5 and they include:
(a) FreeClassOWL, a fully GoodRelations-compliant ontology for describing construction and building materials and
services, derived from the FreeClass classification standard;
(b) the Eurobau Utility ontology, which defines a few key
extensions to GoodRelations for this particular vertical do-
main; (c) the BauDataWeb RDF dataset, containing over
88 million triples of real business data with a high domain
density, which includes geographical data for warehouse locations (of manufacturers and resellers) and in a large part,
product features using the FreeClassOWL ontology.

An additional and intended capability of this BauDataWeb RDF dataset is that it can be combined with
other data sources on the Semantic Web, such as:
(a)
DBpedia6, for information about business entities, population or transportation infrastructure; (b) LinkedGeoData7,
which provides open geographical data in a structured for-
mat; (c) governmental information; or (d) real estate offers.
To that effect, the BauDataWeb RDF dataset is available
via a SPARQL endpoint and all deliverables are fully compliant with current open W3C Semantic technologies and
Linked Data principles.

To illustrate our contribution, we equipped BauDataWeb
with a demonstrative application to serve as both, a userfriendly interface and an evaluation tool to the new functionality provided. All of this work is discussed in detail
throughout the rest of the paper as follows: Section 2 analyzes the main components of the project involved in the
creation of a BauDataWeb RDF dataset; Section 3 provides
a quality assessment of the produced RDF and presents
a demonstrative application to illustrate some of the new
functionality gained; Section 4 reviews existing relevant resources considered in the context of this work; and finally
Section 5 concludes the paper with our final remarks.

2. PRODUCING BAUDATAWEB

This section focuses on the various aspects relevant to
the methodology employed for the creation of the FreeClassOWL ontology, the Eurobau Utility ontology, the BauDataWeb RDF dataset and the strategy for the continued
management of this data repository. Figure 1 provides a
high-level architecture view of the interaction among these
components and it will help to anchor the discussion going
forward.

2.1 The FreeClass Classification in OWL

FreeClass is an open-source product classification standard for the domain of building and construction materials
[4]. All categories (nodes) in the classification are arranged
in a hierarchical tree structure. Analyzing the classification,
we noticed the following main characteristics: more than
2,800 categories in four hierarchical levels, 170 properties,
and 1,400 predefined values. FreeClass provides also description labels for all of these elements that in most cases are
available in eight languages (Czech, English, German, Hun-
garian, Italian, Polish, Romanian, and Slovak). See Table 1.
Note that languages are listed using their 2-letter codes as
per ISO 639-28. One of the goals of the BauDataWeb project
was to develop a GoodRelations-compliant ontology based
on the FreeClass product classification for describing construction and building materials, which will be referred to
hereon as FreeClassOWL. All categories in the FreeClass
classification hierarchy are defined by an eight-digit numeric
code, where every two digits classify a new level and the level
can be determined by the length of the numeric code. The
first level is composed of eleven different categories.
2.1.1 GoodRelations Ontology
GoodRelations is a light-weight Web ontology for e-
commerce on the Semantic Web [8]. The ontology pro-

most frequently used concepts involved in the description of an offering, such as product or service details,
business entities, prices, and terms and conditions among
others. To further categorize products and to describe
them more precisely, GoodRelations also allows to extend products with classes and features of comprehensive product classification standards (e.g.
eClassOWL
[6] or the Product Types Ontology9).
The resulting
FreeClassOWL ontology relied on this extension capability of GoodRelations to accommodate product clas-
sifications. GoodRelations elements will be referred to
using the commonly accepted namespace prefix gr:. Thus,
http://purl.org/goodrelations/v1#ProductOrService is
equivalent to gr:ProductOrService.
2.1.2 FreeClassOWL Ontology
The process of creating a valid, consistent OWL ontology
from the FreeClass product classification included several
steps. The main steps are aligned to the suggested guidelines for creating vertical product ontologies that extend
and comply with GoodRelations10: namely, (1) defining all
classes of products and services needed; (2) collecting all
relevant properties for each class; (3) for every property, determining which type of property it is (either object or data
type); (4) collecting all relevant value types or predefined
values. To assist with this process, we relied on a set of four
files in comma separated value (CSV) format that described
all elements in the full open FreeClass classification, using
a proprietary encoding developed by our project industrial
partner, inndata Datentechnik GmbH 2. The transformation
into a GoodRelations compliant OWL ontology was implemented using a Python script, which ultimately delivered
the FreeClassOWL ontology as one file in RDF/XML for-
mat. The namespace URI created for the FreeClassOWL ontology is http://www.freeclass.eu/freeclass_v1# and its
elements will be referred to by using the namespace prefix
fc:. Hence, http://www.freeclass.eu/freeclass_v1#hiera
rchyCode is equivalent to fc:hierarchyCode. The rest of this
section describes these main steps in more detail and the
most relevant design decisions applied.
2.1.3 Classes of FreeClassOWL
The first step was to generate all classes of the FreeClassOWL ontology. To do so, the GenTax (Generic/Taxo-
nomic) approach [9] was used given that it allows to preserve
the taxonomic structure of the original FreeClass categories
in the class structure of the resulting ontology. The GenTax
method derives two OWL classes from each FreeClass classification category. The first is a context-specific class, in
this case in the domain of building materials, and is a specialization of gr:ProductOrService. The second represents
a broader taxonomic concept that preserves the hierarchy
of the original FreeClass structure using the rdfs:subClassOf
relation. The naming convention for the identifier of these
two types of classes starts with fc:C , followed by an ID
and ends with -gen or -tax respectively.

For traceability purposes to the original schema, a series
of design decisions were applied in the conversion process:
(1) the ID component of every class name, is mapped to

9http://www.productontology.org/
10http://wiki.goodrelations-vocabulary.org/Documenta
tion/Extensions

a strong identifier field in the source CSV files. The strong
identifier is unique to the specific FreeClass category that the
associated fc:C ID-gen and fc:C ID-tax pair of OWL classes
represent; (2) every class fc:C ID-gen is, in addition of being a subclass of gr:ProductOrService, also a subclass of the
corresponding fc:C ID-tax class, to preserve its alignment
to the category in the original FreeClass classification that
it was derived from; (3) the taxonomic class fc:C ID-tax,
stores the eight-digit numeric code of the original FreeClass
category via the annotation property fc:hierarchyCode; and
(4) the context specific class fc:C ID-gen, stores the URL of
the HTML page associated to the category in the FreeClass
Web portal3 via the property rdfs:seeAlso. These provenance traces between the original FreeClass product classification and the classes in the FreeClassOWL ontology, allow
for exploiting the original hierarchy for queries and other operations on the data annotated with the resulting ontology.
The eight language descriptions supported in FreeClass,
are preserved in all FreeClassOWL classes via the property
rdfs:label, including the appropriate two-letter language tag
in the XML Schema data type string. Additional comments
for further describing the FreeClassOWL classes, are given
only in English via the property rdfs:comment. In certain
cases, where languages are not given, special filters avoid the
generation of empty property value literals.

2.1.4 Properties of FreeClassOWL
The conversion of properties in the FreeClass product classification to OWL properties in the FreeClassOWL ontology
was perhaps the most manually intensive task. The task
implied the analysis of every property in the source CSV
files and it turned out particularly challenging because ulti-
mately, it required certain knowledge or familiarization with
concepts specific to the building materials industry. The
range of possible values observed for a property, determined
the appropriate type of OWL property that it should be
transformed into in FreeClassOWL, i.e. either a data type
or an object property. Three distinct sets of range values
were observed, namely (1) strings of characters; (2) numeric
values representing some type of unit of measurement (i.e.
centimeters, cubic meters, etc.); or (3) predefined values representing features applicable to certain properties (i.e. water repellent, corrosion protection, iron, etc.).

In terms of the FreeClassOWL ontology, FreeClass properties whose range of values aligned to (1) above, were
transformed into OWL data type properties, while properties whose values aligned to either (2) or (3), were transformed into OWL object properties. Furthermore, based on
the guidelines to build GoodRelations-compliant product
ontology extensions10, OWL data type properties became
subproperties of gr:datatypeProductOrServiceProperty; and
OWL object properties whose values aligned to either (2) or
(3), became subproperties of either gr:quantitativeProduct-
OrServiceProperty, or gr:qualitativeProductOrServicePro-
perty respectively. (From here on, the suffix -POSP will
be used as a shortcut for -ProductOrServiceProperty on
the three properties involved)

At the end of the process, the 174 properties of FreeClass,
were transformed into two data type properties, and 81
quantitative and 91 qualitative object properties in the resulting FreeClassOWL ontology.

The naming convention for the identifier of all FreeClass
properties in FreeClassOWL employs the pattern fc:P ID,

                                               27where the ID portion is mapped to a strong identifier field
in the source CSV files. The strong identifier is unique to
the specific FreeClass property represented by the associated
fc:P ID OWL property.

There is one more property explicitly added to the
FreeClassOWL ontology that did not fall
into the approach described above. This is the annotation property
fc:hierarchyCode. This annotation property stores the 8-
digit numeric code of a FreeClass category and its purpose
and intended use has already been addressed in the previous
section.

All eight language descriptions are supported following the
same approach outlined for the classes of FreeClassOWL sce-
nario, via the properties rdfs:label. Additional comments are
supported via rdfs:comment, with the exception that comments on properties were available only in German.

2.1.5 Domain and Range of Properties
As subproperties of one of the properties gr:datatype-,
gr:quantitative-, or gr:qualitativePOSP, the domain of every fc:P ID property of FreeClassOWL was set to the class
gr:ProductOrService.

The range of the two FreeClassOWL properties subsumed
by gr:datatypePOSP, should align to the range of an OWL
data type property that is, an RDF literal or a simple XML
Schema data type. The range of values observed in the original FreeClass schema for the two properties eligible as a
OWL data type property, was in fact a string.

The range of the 81 FreeClassOWL properties subsumed
by gr:quantitativePOSP is the class gr:QuantitativeValue.
To comply with GoodRelations, such a property should
specify a numeric value and the unit of measurement
that the value represents. GoodRelations supports this
requirement via the property gr:hasUnitOfMeasurement.
The range of gr:hasUnitOfMeasurement is by convention a
three-letter code from the UN/CEFACT [15] standard of
units of measurement. The units of measurement found for
the properties of the original FreeClass product classifica-
tion, used an internal ad-hoc encoding. In the conversion
process all codes found, were mapped to the corresponding
UN/CEFACT standard common codes.

The range of the 91 FreeClassOWL properties subsumed
by gr:qualitativePOSP is the class gr:QualitativeValue. The
expected range of such a property is a predefined ontology
individual. FreeClassOWL includes many of these individu-
als, which are discussed in detail in the next section.

2.1.6 Individuals of FreeClassOWL
The creation of ontology individuals was the last step of
the transformation process of the FreeClass product clas-
sification. Another set of elements found in the FreeClass
schema consisted of predefined values. In fact, there were
1,423 predefined values. As stated earlier, predefined values
represent particular features applicable to certain properties
of FreeClass and they delimit the range of possible values for
such properties.

In FreeClassOWL and based on the guidelines for ontology extensions compliant with GoodRelations, predefined
values were transformed into OWL individuals of the class
gr:QualitativeValue.

The naming convention for the identifier of all individuals
in FreeClassOWL follows the pattern fc:V ID. The ID part
is mapped to a strong identifier field in the source CSV files

that is unique to the associated predefined value.

Analogous to previous cases, a textual description of predefined values was preserved via rdfs:label while other comments were stored via rdfs:comment. The former was available in eight languages, while the latter only in German.
2.2 Eurobau Utility Ontology

BauDataWeb required a few domain-specific conceptual
elements particularly relevant in the building materials industry that are not defined in GoodRelations. For this purpose we developed a small ontology, the Eurobau Utility on-
tology. The new namespace URI of the ontology was set to
http://semantic.eurobau.com/eurobau-utility.owl# and
the namespace prefix assigned to it is ebu:. The ontology
consists of three OWL individuals and two OWL object
properties.

The three new individuals are instances of the GoodRelations class gr:DeliveryMethod, and represent three standardized procedures for transferring products to a destination
location. They are: ebu:DeliveryModeOwnFleetWithCrane,
ebu:DeliveryModeRentalTruck, and ebu:DeliveryModeOwn-
FleetWithLiftgate.

The two new object properties represent two different
viewpoints on the distance between two locations. One
refers to the distance measured in a hypothetical straight
line (as if no obstacles existed between the points of origin and destination) and the other refers to the distance
over an existing connecting path (i.e. a road suitable for
driving). They are named ebu:eligibleDeliveryDistance and
ebu:eligibleDeliveryDistanceRoad, respectively. The range
of both properties is set to the class gr:QuantitativeValue,
whose individuals are intended to be expressed as a floating
point number measured in kilometers.

As stated in the introductory section, findability of building materials is an important aspect to be considered in this
domain, and it can be severely affected by different delivery options or distances. A key goal of the Eurobau Utility
ontology is to allow a more granular description of these
characteristics so that they can be exploited by queries or
other operations on data annotated with the ontology.
2.3 BauDataWeb Dataset

FreeClassOWL and the Eurobau Utility ontology introduced in the previous sections served as data models for the
BauDataWeb dataset, the Semantic Web representation of
Eurobau data (cf. Figure 1). The Eurobau dataset provides data related to the domain of construction materi-
als.
In particular, it comprises information about brands
and companies, warehouse locations, product models, product model variants, availability, transportation and delivery,
and geopositional data. The comprehensive dataset comprises 2,210,824 offerings, 67,218 product models and vari-
ants, 87 manufacturers/brands, 16 resellers, and 194 warehouse locations. In the following, we describe our approach
of transforming the Eurobau datasets into RDF, as outlined
in Figure 1.

2.3.1 Data Transformation
Unlike the source files of the ontologies, the instance data
of Eurobau resides in a relational database hosted at Eu-
robau.com, spread across seven interlinked database tables.
As a preliminary step, the data of the Eurobau datasets
has to be cleansed before being fed into the transformation

                                               28process component. The source data suffers from poorly normalized tables, pragmatic design decisions that have evolved
over time, and lack of standards compliance. For that pur-
pose, some rules for improving the data quality right from
the relational database are applied. The cleansing rules include stripping whitespaces from string values, overcoming
inconsistent usage of units of measurement, or mappings between the non-standard use of country codes and respective
codes in the ISO-3166-211 standard.

The result of applying custom data transformation rules
on the instance data and of generating annotations based
on the FreeClassOWL ontology leads to a considerable number of small RDF files. The produced files are intended for
representing different types of resources as highlighted in
Figure 2, which shows the relationships between files at the
manufacturer and at the reseller side.
Instead of labeling
the nodes in Figure 2 according to the file names used in
the dataset, we decided to assign meaningful labels to them
(e.g. Product Offering instead of Offering.rdf ). This allows
us to accommodate the relationships that exist between the
conceptual elements described in the files.

The involved conceptual elements comply with the Agent-
Promise-Object principle, a basic structure of offers that underlies the GoodRelations ontology. The principle implies
that an agent (gr:BusinessEntity, represented by Company)
makes a promise (gr:offers with gr:Offering, represented by
Product Offering) to transfer property rights (in our con-
text, to sell) for an object (gr:ProductOrService, again
represented by Product Offering).
In addition, Company,
occurring twice in the architecture of Figure 2 (i.e. at manufacturer and at reseller side), defines information about the
location from where the promise is made; whereas Product
Offering contains the object that is promised, i.e. the prod-
uct. Products can have model data attached to them using gr:hasMakeAndModel. The difference between products
and product models is subtle but important. While a product embodies a tangible object, product models describe the
make and model (or prototype, datasheet) of products with
shared characteristics. Thus, only products are subject to
physical transfer between business parties.

In the RDF materialization of the Eurobau data, we distinguish two types of models, namely product models (Prod-
uct Model ) and product model variants (Product Model Vari-
ant). Both are defined in terms of the GoodRelations gr:
ProductOrServiceModel class. Nonetheless, the latter serves
to describe variants of the former. Each variant inherits all
data type, quantitative, and qualitative values that are defined by the related (or base) product model. Furthermore,
Product Models are used to ensure the linkage to their man-
ufacturers. Thus, the same property values do not have to
be defined repeatedly which preserves space and conforms
to the idea of best data modeling practice.

An example in Turtle syntax that we put online12 demonstrates (a) how product features with corresponding values
are attached to a product model variant, and (b) how links
to the related product model (using gr:isVariantOf ), the
URL of the product image, and the related HTML page on
the Eurobau portal are created.

Table 2: Coverage of FreeClass in the Eurobau
dataset

Overall, more than 65% of the product models are described using FreeClassOWL classes, whereas 60% of the
model properties are assigned from FreeClassOWL (see Table 2). On average (median), a product model consists of five
properties. The obtained Semantic Web dataset comprises
ca. 2.2 million individual RDF/XML files plus a few large,
compressed data dump files in N-Triples syntax that aggregate several RDF files into a compound data source. That
aims to simplify and speed up the crawling and loading of
the full dataset.
2.3.2 Data Management
One specific requirement of the project demanded the deployment of the RDF files on a subdomain5 of Eurobau.com.
The host of this subdomain consisted of a Microsoft Windows platform running Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) as Web server, and under the management of our
industrial partner.

From that platform, a Semantic sitemap13 [2] is served
that provides an overview (site index) of sub-datasets, i.e.
datasets that contain data that belong to a single manufacturer or reseller. The sub-datasets describe the locations
from where the RDF files are served, i.e. organized and
stored in meaningful folders on the server.

Besides the storage of physical files on a server, it is sensible to also provide a SPARQL endpoint for the publication and easy accessibility of the data. Most SPARQL
implementations offer means for loading huge amounts of
data. The complete BauDataWeb dataset has been made
available in the following public SPARQL endpoint: http:

Concerning data management tasks, a command-line
script written in Python handles the full conversion. The
script acts as the transformation process component of
the BauDataWeb dataset as illustrated in Figure 1.
It is
invoked by specifying relevant companies together with the
product models, product model variants, and, if applicable,
product offerings, to be made available on the Web of Data.
Cron jobs scheduled at regular intervals (e.g. once a month)
help to keep the dataset up-to-date. The script indicates
updates of datasets that just became available by simply
changing the lastmod element of the sitemap. That means
that clients are not supposed to download the full catalog of
datasets, but only those datasets that have in fact changed.

3. EVALUATION

In this section, we evaluate the contributions of our work.
Firstly, we validate the potential of our approach by addressing the limitations raised in the introduction. Secondly, we
provide a fully-fledged demonstrator that provides a userfriendly interface for the consumption of BauDataWeb data.
Lastly, we show that the deployment of the datasets complies with general Linked Data guidelines.
3.1 Exploring Novel Use Cases

In the introduction, we argued that the traditional approach based on data in a relational database suffers from
several drawbacks that our proposal is able to solve. To
shortly recap the limitations, they were given as the difficulty of (a) searching for building materials spanning more
than one FreeClass category, (b) querying over all materials that meet a specific set of attributes or requirements,
(c) finding manufacturers within certain geographic dis-
tances, and (d) combining construction material data with
other data sources on the Web.

We can show that BauDataWeb can contribute to overcome these limitations from various angles. To address issues (a), (b), and (d), we crafted SPARQL queries that
we made available online14 as interactive queries (queries
a, b and c), and which are subsequently explained at an abstract level. In order to solve issue (a), a SPARQL query
can be defined that selects all building materials relative
to one or more FreeClassOWL classes, for example by using UNION clauses. Even better yet, if the RDF store is
capable of RDFS entailment, the taxonomy hierarchy in
FreeClassOWL provided by the GenTax approach can be
utilized to infer all materials defined as instances of classes
and subclasses of a specific FreeClass category. This way,
we are able to harness knowledge given by and deducible
from the declared class axioms. For example, materials referring to different branches in the class hierarchy can be
searched on the basis of inference techniques. For overcoming problem (b) instead, a SPARQL query based on basic
graph pattern matching is sufficient that matches over triples
including specific properties and attributes, optionally supplied with FILTER functions to express constraints such as
above 10 centimeters in length. To address issue (d), we
again crafted a SPARQL query which includes data provided
by external SPARQL endpoints using query federation introduced by SPARQL 1.1. It looks up DBPedia URIs for

14http://www.ebusiness-unibw.org/tools/baudataweb-
queries/

addresses contained in the BauDataWeb dataset. Unlike all
data that is isolated in a relational database, as it is the
case for Eurobau, structured data published on the Semantic Web by virtue of appropriate ontologies helps to unlock
useful information that can be made available to other services for an immediate benefit. Therefore, the publication
of Eurobau data at high granularity on the Web can be seen
as an important step towards enabling better exploratory
searches over Linked Open Data in the context of building
and construction materials.

As issue (c) is concerned, it has actually been implemented
for the demo application that is presented in the upcoming
Section 3.2. The use case takes advantage of geopositional
data of warehouse locations stored in the dataset.
3.2 BauDataWeb Demo Application

The demo application presented herein provides a userfriendly way of interacting with the BauDataWeb dataset.
It combines the benefit of searching for an item classified according to FreeClassOWL with a straightforward way of presenting products grouped according to the companies (ware-
houses) offering the products. Companies are ordered by
their vicinity to a custom location which can be specified by
the user. The tool furthermore allows to filter query results
by relevant properties from FreeClassOWL. The demonstrator is available online15.

The entry point to the usage of the tool is to select a
FreeClass code from a tree navigation representing the hierarchy of the industry standard. Next, all FreeClass properties related to the selected product category are gathered
using a SPARQL query. Quantitative properties with upper
and lower boundary values are presented in text fields and
can be edited by the user. Similarly, eligible qualitative values are provided as drop-down lists to supply criteria to narrow down the result set. The final steps involve specifying
optional search parameters and entering address information
about the delivery location, which steps are well-supported
and self-explanatory. The resulting SPARQL query is executed taking into consideration all parameters supplied with
the input form.

Beyond the demonstrator, in Figure 3, we show a map
that displays all warehouse locations in Austria and its sur-
roundings.
In order to obtain this map, we translated all
geo-tagged company data in the RDF files to KML (Keyhole
Markup Language), a XML format to encode geographic information supported by Google Maps. For the conversion
we made use of the Geo2KML16 Web service. A map with
all warehouse locations that aligns with the excerpt from
Figure 3 is available at http://goo.gl/maps/SpPNO.
3.3 Deployment of BauDataWeb

To deploy all deliverables of the BauDataWeb project, we
adhered to available best practices not only on their development phase, but also on the publishing and deployment
phase. If the former focused on the production of a valid,
well-formed RDF data repository, the focus of the latter is
set on enabling and facilitating a useful and practical consumption of this repository. As an evaluation benchmark to
fulfill these goals, we aimed to comply with the four Linked
Data principles [5]. In short: (1) use URIs as names to iden-

                                               30GenTax methodology [7], which enables the conversion
of product classification standards with potentially inconsistent semantic relations among their classes,
into fully
compliant OWL ontologies. The alignment between the
GenTax approach and the GoodRelations ontology is also
well-defined, which simplifies the creation of ontologies that
extend and comply with the latter. The FreeClass classification lay at the intersection of all of these characteristics
and thus, as discussed in Section 2, GenTax was applied for
building the FreeClassOWL ontology.

For the transformation of heterogeneous data sources into
RDF data, some of the most prominent tools were examined
such as, RDF Refine[12], Any2318 (Anything to triples), XLWrap [11], RDF123 [3], D2RQ [1], or R2RML19. At the same
time, we had to accommodate certain requirements and constraints specific to the BauDataWeb project, which included
(1) traces of proprietary information in the data sources;
(2) certain inconsistencies on the data sources that hindered
the level of automation; (3) deployment of deliverables on a
Windows platform under the management of our industrial
partner; (4) minimal performance impairment and run-time
intrusion into the relational databases that support the Eu-
robau.com portal by the new semantic technologies; or (5)
support for a command-line interface for executing all data
transformation processes. These requirements deemed unfeasible for different reasons in each case, the reuse of the
tools examined, which led us to the development of custom,
fit for purpose, conversion scripts and utility tools.

Lastly, if to the application of e-commerce solutions for
the construction industry, we add the adoption of Semantic Web technologies, the space for finding related work can
get fairly reduced. Yet, several examples emerged as part
of the First Intl. Workshop on Linked Data in Architecture
and Construction held in 201220. All works from the event,
showcase compelling scenarios where the use of OWL ontologies and Linked Data could assist to overcome some of the
reoccurring interoperability issues found in the architecture,
engineering and construction (AEC) sector. And although
this domain overlaps significantly with that of BauDataWeb,
their focus leans towards the management of information exchange across the many actors involved in the execution of
AEC projects. A topic much broader than the development
of new e-commerce solutions for the construction materials
marketplace, the core motivation of this project.

The conclusion at the end of this review indicates that
BauDataWeb is, to the best of our knowledge, the first use
case that relies on open standard Semantic Web technolo-
gies, to bring new, more granular and better articulated
search, exploration and exploitation capabilities (both as
a stand-alone solution or as part of the Web of Data), to
a significant data repository of the building and construction materials domain, a prominent B2B/B2C (Business-to-
Business/-Consumer) e-commerce marketplace.

5. CONCLUSIONS

In the context of building and construction materials, the
Eurobau portal already provides means to search for granular descriptions of products, suppliers and warehouse loca-
tions. Yet, the technical limitations of the traditional Web

tify everything; (2) use HTTP URIs so that those names can
be dereferenced (or looked up); (3) when someone looks up a
URI, provide useful information (i.e. HTML or RDF/XML);
and (4) include links to other URIs so that they can discover
more things.

Principles (1) and (2) are satisfied provided that all data
resources involved in BauDataWeb (e.g. offerings, product
models, online Web documents...), use unique, cool URIs
[14] and are dereferenceable via HTTP.

Compliance to principle (3) is supported by the configuration of the content negotiation 17 functionality of HTTP.
In general terms, content negotiation allows to format or
present the data of a Web resource differently, depending
on the type of HTTP request made by the agent looking
up the URI that links to such resource. In the context of
BauDataWeb, content negotiation was configured to deliver
the correct representation of FreeClassOWL (RDF/XML or
HTML format), depending on the type of request.

Lastly, principle (4) acknowledges three types of RDF
links in order to discover additional data about a Web re-
source. These are relationship, identity, and vocabulary links
[5]. The RDF data of BauDataWeb includes vocabulary
links, such as those required in order for both, the FreeClassOWL and BauData Utility ontologies, to specialize and extend elements in the GoodRelations ontology.

In addition to these four principles, other recommendations were applied to facilitate the consumption of the
BauDataWeb repository, such as Semantic sitemaps [2] and
Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) [16].

4. RELATED WORK

There are several topics closely related to our work on
this project. They include, at a low level, closer to our
methodology, (1) the re-engineering of non-ontological resources as OWL ontologies; (2) the transformation of various data sources into structured data in RDF format; and
at a high level, as an overall solution, (3) additional existing
use cases where Semantic Web technologies may have been
applied to the e-commerce backbone of the construction industry marketplace.

The vast majority of existing approaches on the reengineering of non-ontological resources into OWL ontologies are surveyed in [17]. One of such approaches is the

databases, hamper the creation of advanced usage scenarios involving better search and browsing experiences, typically enabled by structured data, enrichment with other
data sources, and capabilities to infer additional knowledge.
In this paper, we presented the results of a project carried
out with an industry partner to publish the comprehensive
Eurobau dataset, which covers the Austrian building and
construction materials industry to a large extent, in the Web
of Linked Data on the basis of the GoodRelations vocabulary
for e-commerce. Our most notable achievements include the
development of the FreeClassOWL ontology, the Eurobau
Utility ontology, and the BauDataWeb RDF dataset, which
was derived from the comprehensive Eurobau dataset, giving
rise to more than 88 million triples of real business data with
a high domain density. One of the core challenges in the
context of the resulting BauDataWeb dataset was to ensure
easy data access and reliable, efficient data management.

In order to evaluate our work, we showcased novel use
cases in SPARQL that previously, based on past technical
capabilities, would not have been easily possible. Further-
more, we presented a user-friendly online demonstrator for
searching within the BauDataWeb dataset and displayed
warehouse locations on a Google map relying on geo coordinates in the dataset. We showed that the deployment
of BauDataWeb complies with best practices of publishing
Linked Data sources on the Web.

To put our solution into context, we contrasted it to related works in the fields and domains of construction indus-
try, ontology creation from non-ontological resources, and
general approaches to transform datasets into RDF.

In summary, our approach facilitates novel search and
product matchmaking scenarios in the domain of building
and construction materials.
