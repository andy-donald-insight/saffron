ABSTRACT
The provision of Linked Data about sporting results enables
extensive statistics, while connections to further datasets allow enhanced and sophisticated analyses. Moreover, providing sports data as Linked Open Data may promote new ap-
plications, which are currently impossible due to the locked
nature of todays proprietary sports databases. Though the
sport domain is strongly underrepresented in the Linked
Open Data Cloud. In this paper we present a dataset containing information about soccer entities crawled from heterogeneous sources and linked to related entities from the
LOD cloud. To enable easy exploration and to illustrate
the capabilities of the dataset a web interface is providing a
structured overview and extensive statistics.

INTRODUCTION

1.
The Linked Open Data (LOD) Cloud comprises 870 datasets
containing more than 62 billion triples [1]. The majority of
triples describes governmental (42 %) and geographic data
(19 %), whereas Linked Data about sports is strongly under-
represented. Sport competition results are collected by various authorities and other parties, they are connected to
events, teams, players, etc. Providing Linked Data about
sports and sporting results enables extensive statistics, while
connections to further datasets allow enhanced and sophisticated analyses. Moreover, providing sports data as Linked
Open Data may promote new applications, which are currently impossible due to the locked nature of todays proprietary sports databases. By enabling linkage to additional
resources such as geographical, weather, or social network
data, interesting statistics for the sport enthusiast can be

easily derived and provide further information that would
be hidden otherwise.

In this paper we describe an extensive RDF dataset of soccer data providing soccer matches, teams, and player in-
formation, collected from heterogeneous sources and linked
to LOD datasets like the DBpedia. The raw data was collected via APIs and by crawling authorities websites, like
UEFA.com or Fussballdaten.de, and is linked to further web
resources for supportive information, such as Twitter postings for most recent information, Youtube videos for multimedia support, and weather information.

Based on this aggregated new dataset we have implemented
an interactive interface to explore this data. The interface provides various statistics that have been made possible
solely by the aggregation of diverse sources.

2. RELATED WORK
The BBC Future Media and Technology department applies
semantic technologies according to their Dynamic Semantic
Publishing (DSP) strategy [3] to automate the publication,
aggregation, and re-purposing of inter-related content ob-
jects. The first launch using DSP was the BBC Sport FIFA
World Cup 2010 website1 featuring more than 700 team,
group and player pages. However, the data internally exploited by the system is not published as Linked Data.

An extensive dataset of soccer data is aggregated by footy-
tube. According to their website2 the data is crawled from
various sources and connected by semantic technologies. The
recipes, however, are not described in detail. Footytubes
data include statistics about soccer matches and teams, as
well as related media content, such as videos, news, pod-
casts, and blogs. The data is accessible via the openfooty
API but is subject to restrictions that forbid the republication as Linked Data.

Generally, it is hard to find open data about sport results,
since exploitation rights are possessed by responsible administrative body organizations. An approach to liberate sport

which collect sports data for public use. As to the authors
best knowledge, the presented dataset provides the first extensive soccer dataset published as Linked Data, consisting
of more than 9 million triples.

3. LINKED SOCCER DATASET
Our intention was to create a dataset including reliable information about soccer events covering as much historical
data as available including recent competition results. A
cross domain dataset such as DBpedia is not sufficient for
this purpose, since soccer data in DBpedia is incomplete and
unreliable.

The dataset is aggregated from raw data originating from
multiple sources, namely Fussballdaten.de4, Uefa.com5, DB-
pedia6, the Twitter feed of the Kicker magazine7, the Sky
Sport HD Youtube Channel8, and weather information from
Deutscher Wetterdienst9. Fussballdaten.de and Uefa.com
provide match results and player information. By analyzing the Twitter feed, live match data (Kicker updates its
feed with live results) is extracted and free text tweets are
used to find latest news about players or teams. Our data
collection ranges from the 1960s until today and is updated
constantly. Updates are scheduled every matchday, while
the Twitter feeds are analyzed every 30 seconds during running matches. Currently, the dataset contains information
about the German 1. and 2. Bundesliga, UEFA Champions League, European and World Championships. Additional leagues can easily be included by setting up new data
sources.

In order to be able to describe detailed information about
soccer data we have created a dedicated vocabulary Soccer
Voc10, which reuses basic parts of the BBC Sport Ontology
[2] but includes also soccer specific classes and properties to
describe in-game-events (e. g. goal, substitution, booking),
various persona classes (soccer player, referee, soccer man-
ager), soccer teams and clubs, stadiums, seasons, as well as
relations between them.

The data from the named sources is converted to and persistently stored as RDF triples. Each entity is referenced by a
unique URI, which unites all facts about the entity, regardless of the originating data source. As an example, Listing 1
shows a selection from a total of 1,064 triples about the
player Mehmet Scholl.

Due to the legal restrictions on the crawled sources it is not
possible to make the aggregated dataset as a whole publicly available. Therefore we publish an unrestricted sub-
set, which comprises merely the list of all entities with the
respective label, resource type information, and mappings
to DBpedia and other web resources. This dataset is available as an RDF dump at http://mediaglobe.yovisto.com/
SoccerLD/dump/public.ttl.gz.

3.1 Matching
The representation of an entity by a source can vary strongly.
Therefore, it is necessary to recognize, which representations
incorporate the same entity and to combine the information
of multiple representations into a single entity. The algorithm for matching a player entity from Fussballdaten.de
and UEFA.com to DBpedia can be outlined as follows:

1. Querying DBpedia for potential entities matching a
query name: The DBpedia SPARQL endpoint does
not support fuzzy search functionality.
In order to
cover variations, the players name is split into substrings at whitespace characters and DBpedia is queried
separately for each part of the name. Each part needs
to match one of the following attributes: rdfs:label,
dbprop:name, or foaf:name. The check is done using
the Virtuoso full text matching function bif:contains.
Doing so, a list of possible candidates is returned.

2. Filtering results from previous step: The name listed
for each of the returned DBpedia entities is compared
to the players name using the Levenshtein distance.
If the distance is below a certain threshold (we apply
a value of 2 here), the DBpedia entity is considered as
a potential match.

3. Validating the DBpedia entity: The entity is regarded
as correct if it is a person, the date of birth (if present)
matches that of the potential match and the person is
listed as a football player.

Although it might seem plausible to start the process by
matching on the date of birth first in order to narrow down
search space, we observed that often player entities in DBpedia do not come with a valid date of birth. Therefore,
matching on this attribute in first place would strongly affect the number of potential entity candidates.

                                               147Local entities are connected to their respective DBpedia entity using owl:sameAs.

3.2 Matching Twitter
Analysis of Kicker tweets is performed for two purposes:
(1) obtaining live data about running matches for presentation on the website and (2) finding news articles with background information about specific teams. Using the Kicker
twitter streams11 it is possible to find both, as these feeds
offer live data, as well as free text tweets teasing articles
of the Kicker website. Game result tweets have a common,
strict pattern, which renders them simple to parse. It can
be assumed that these tweets are generated automatically,
as there are no pattern violations. One example tweet could
be

Borussia Dortmund - Bayern M unchen 1:2 Tor: Robben

(89., Ribery) #BVBFCB http://bit.ly/14O58cp

which reveals the pattern

[home team] - [guest team] [current result] Tor: [scorer]

([minute], [assist]) [hashtag, containing of three letters for

each team] [link to detail page]

The parts can be extracted using regular expressions.
In
order to map these elements to entities in our data, we firstly
match the team names using the Levenshtein distance. As
we have only 18 teams to consider for a Bundesliga match,
this works in 100 % of all cases. For matching both players
(scorer and assist) we consider all players who played for the
goal-scoring team in the last two years. Matching is done
by last name and works in 98 % of all cases.

In order to find links to background information about a
team, free text tweets are parsed. An example for such a
tweet is:

Bayerns triumph - All about the magnificent final in

Wembley #BL http://bit.ly/Z8KpyE

Since team names are usually abbreviated or paraphrased
within Kicker tweets (e. g. Bayern or FCB instead of FC
Bayern Munich a list of common short names for each team
has been assembled automatically. This list is generated
from parts of the team name, employed hashtags, and DBpedia nicknames. In the case of Bayern Munich this list contains names like Bayern, Munich, Rekordmeister, FCB
and more. By using this list we are able to match team
entities within a tweet.

If one or more of these names are part of a tweet, it is considered to refer to the specific team.

3.3 Statistics
At the time of this writing, the dataset comprises descriptions of 56,537 soccer players, 1,402 clubs, 1,514 teams,

11e. g. https://twitter.com/kicker_bl_li

38,098 matches, 98,794 goals, 1,686 referees, 1,870 managers,
717 stadiums, and 207 seasons or competition series. In to-
tal, 9 million triples have been generated up to now, 3.35
million of which originate from raw data of Fussballdaten.de
and 2.10 million triples from the UEFA.com website.

3.4 Evaluation
In order to evaluate the quality of the matching, a percentage of matched entities has been reviewed. The correctness
of these matches has been confirmed by manually judging
the results. For Bundesliga, all teams (54) and about 78 %
of all players (6,790) have been matched successfully to DBpedia entities. Missing matches were mostly due to missing
player entities in DBpedia.

The algorithm for matching the results of soccer matches
from the Twitter feed was capable of matching 99.60 % results correctly, which was confirmed by a evaluation on a
random data set of 200 tweets. The algorithm for matching
team names in tweets containing unstructured text resulted
in matching 1,574 of a total of 1,780 Tweets. The unmatched
tweets contained no team names, so that a match was not
possible. An evaluation of a random data set of 150 Tweets
showed that all had been correctly matched.

3.5 Application
The dataset can be accessed via a demonstrator website12,
where each entity is presented on its own page with relevant
information, statistics, and links to related entities. Addi-
tionally, a variety of possible complex queries are demon-
strated, such as Which player scored most often on him-
self? or From which foreign country do most players in
the last Bundesliga season come from?. These show the
possibilities that come with providing soccer data as Linked
Data.
In Figure 1, two different views of the website are
shown.

4. CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK
In this paper we presented a rich soccer dataset, which, to
our best knowledge, is the first comprehensive linked soccer dataset. We published non-restricted portions of the
dataset, since the publication of the dataset as a whole is
prevented by legal rights belonging to the respective au-
thorities. An application based on this data not only allows to browse the dataset and to provide various statistics
about players, teams and matches but also exploits the advantages of Linked Data principles in order to provide additional information currently not considered by available
soccer datasets.

Possible additions could include advanced and more detailed
data such as the number of ball contacts, played passes, or
the distance covered by a player during a match. Currently,
the developed extraction framework covers data mainly from
the Bundesliga. Integration of leagues from further countries
as well as lower regional leagues, however, is possible since
a lot of this data is published by enthusiasts on the web.
An interface for data editing in order to provide users of our
dataset with the ability to submit own data, as well as to
edit and correct present data is likewise imaginable. Future
extensions will also aim to include rich media content, such
