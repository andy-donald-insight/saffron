Abstract. More and more websites embed structured data describing for instance products, reviews, blog posts, people, organizations, events, and cooking
recipes into their HTML pages using markup standards such as Microformats,
Microdata and RDFa. This development has accelerated in the last two years as
major Web companies, such as Google, Facebook, Yahoo!, and Microsoft, have
started to use the embedded data within their applications. In this paper, we analyze the adoption of RDFa, Microdata, and Microformats across the Web. Our
study is based on a large public Web crawl dating from early 2012 and consisting of 3 billion HTML pages which originate from over 40 million websites. The
analysis reveals the deployment of the different markup standards, the main topical areas of the published data as well as the different vocabularies that are used
within each topical area to represent data. What distinguishes our work from earlier studies, published by the large Web companies, is that the analyzed crawl as
well as the extracted data are publicly available. This allows our findings to be verified and to be used as starting points for further domain-specific investigations
as well as for focused information extraction endeavors.

Keywords: Web Science, Web of Data, RDFa, Microdata, Microformats.

1 Introduction

In order to support web applications to understand the content of HTML pages an increasing number of websites have started to semantically markup their pages using different markup formats. The most prevalent of these standards are Microformats1, which
use style definitions to annotate HTML text with terms from a fixed set of vocabular-
ies; RDFa [1], which is used to embed any kind of RDF data into HTML pages; and
Microdata [6], a recent format developed in the context of HTML5.

The embedded data is crawled together with the HTML pages by search engines,
such as Google, Yahoo!, and Bing, which use the data to enrich their search results [5,3].
These companies have also so far been the only ones capable of providing insights [8,9]
into the amount as well as the types of data that are published on the Web using Micro-
formats, RDFa, and Microdata as they were the only ones possessing large-scale Web

crawls. However, the situation has changed with the advent of the Common Crawl2.
Common Crawl is a non-profit foundation that crawls the Web and regularly publishes
the resulting Web corpora for public usage on Amazon S33.

In this paper, we analyze the deployment of RDFa, Microdata, and Microformats
based on the latest Web corpus that has been published by the Common Crawl foun-
dation. The paper makes the following contributions: 1. It presents the first integrated
study about the adoption of RDFa, Microdata, and Microformats that is based on a
large-scale, publicly-accessible Web corpus and is thus scientifically verifiable. 2. We
identify the main topical areas of the published data as well as the vocabularies that are
commonly used in order to represent data. 3. We give an impression about the structural
richness of the published data by analyzing which properties are used to describe popular types of entities as well as by analyzing the co-occurrence relationships between
different types on the same website. 4. Our results can serve as a starting point for further domain-specific investigations as well as focused information extraction endeavors,
as we provide all extracted data for public download via the WebDataCommons.org
website.

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes the Common Crawl corpus, while Section 3 gives an overview of the data extraction framework
that was used to process the corpus. Section 4 summarizes our overall findings concerning the adoption of the different markup standards. After elaborating on our findings
concerning the the deployment of RDFa and analyzing the main topical areas of the
RDFa data (Section 5), we detail on the deployment of Microdata (Section 6), and Microformats (Section 7). Section 8 compares our results to related work.

2 The Common Crawl Corpus

The analysis presented in this paper is based on the most recent Web crawl provided
by Common Crawl foundation. This Web crawl contains 3,005,629,093 unique HTML
pages which originate from 40.6 million pay-level-domains (PLDs). The corpus was
crawled in the time span between January 27, 2012 and June 05, 2012. The size of the
corpus in compressed form is 48 terabyte. The crawler that is used by the Common
Crawl foundation for gathering the corpus relies on the PageRank algorithm for deciding which pages to retrieve. This makes the Common Crawl corpus a snapshot of the
popular part of the Web. On the other hand, it also results in the number of pages that
are crawled per website to vary widely. For instance, youtube.com is represented by
93.1 million pages within the crawl, whereas 37.5 million PLDs are represented by less
than 100 pages.

3 The Data Extraction Process

The Common Crawl corpus is published in the form of ARC files which can be obtained
from Amazon S34. In order to extract RDFa, Microdata, and Microformats data from

2 http://commoncrawl.org
3 http://aws.amazon.com/datasets/41740
4 s3://aws-publicdatasets/common-crawl/parse-output/
?

?

?
the corpus, we developed a parsing framework which can be executed on Amazon EC2
and supports the parallel extraction from multiple ARC files. The framework relies
on the Anything To Triples (Any23)5 parser library for extracting RDFa, Microdata,
and Microformats from the corpus. Any23 outputs RDF quads, consisting of subject,
predicate, object, and a URL which identifies the HTML page from which the triple
was extracted. For processing the Common Crawl corpus on Amazon EC2, we used
100 AWS x1.large machines. Altogether, extracting the HTML-embedded data from
the corpus required 5,636 machine hours amounting to a total machine rental fee of
$398.72 using Amazon spot instances. As the number of pages that are contained in
the Common Crawl from a single pay-level-domain varies widely, most of the analysis
presented in the following is performed using statistics that are aggregated per PLD. In
order to determine the PLD of a HTML page, we used the Public Suffix List6. Hence, a
PLD not always equals the second level domain, but country specific domains such as
co.uk or mass hosting domains like appspot.com are considered as top level domains in
our experiments. We used Apache Pig7 on Amazon to aggregate the extracted data into
a PLD-class-property matrix for each format. We used Rapidminer8 for the vocabulary
term co-occurrence analyses that will be presented in the following. The generated RDF
dataset as well as the PLD-class-property matrixes are provided for download on the
Web Data Commons (WDC) website9.

4 Overall Results

This section reports our findings concerning the overall deployment of the different
markup formats. We discovered structured data within 369 million out of the 3 billion
pages contained in the Common Crawl corpus (12.3%). The pages containing structured
data originate from 2.29 million among the 40.6 million websites (PLDs) contained in
the corpus (5.64%). The RDF representation of the extracted data consists of 7.3 billion
RDF quads, describing around 1.15 billion typed entities.

Deployment by Format: Table 1 shows the overall deployment of the three different
formats. The second column contains the absolute number of websites that use a specific format. The third column sets these numbers in relation to the overall number
of websites covered by the Common Crawl (40.6 million). In column 4, the number
of pages containing the respective format is provided. In addition, the table lists the
number of typed entities and triples we extracted from the pages containing structured
data. Approximately 519 thousand websites use RDFa, while only 140 thousand websites use Microdata. Microformats are used on 1.7 million websites. It is interesting to
see that Microformats are used by approximately 2.5 times as many websites as RDFa
and Microdata together, despite of the usage of RDFa and Microdata currently being
propagated by the major search engines and social networking platforms.

Deployment by Popularity of Website: Alexa Internet Inc. maintains a list of the
most frequently visited websites. In order to find out how many of the most popular
websites provide structured data, we analyzed the deployment of RDFa, Microdata and
Microformats on websites that are in the Alexa list of the top 1 million websites10. The
results of our analysis are given in the four rightmost columns of Table 2 and show that
the percentage of the Alexa-listed websites providing structured data (74.75% of the
top 100 and 20.56% of the top 1 million) is significantly higher than the percentage of
all websites within the Common Crawl that contain structured data (5.64%).

Deployment by Top-Level-Domain: Table 3 lists the distribution of websites in the
Common Crawl corpus by top-level-domains (TLDs). The last two columns show the
number and percentage of the websites by TLD that embed structured data. We see
that structured data is provided within all TLDs. In general, the deployment is stronger
within generic TLDs like com and net compared to the country specific TLDs.

Deployment of Multiple Formats on the same Website: As websites could decide
to use multiple formats in parallel in order to make it easier for applications to understand their data, we also analyzed the joint usage of two or more formats on the same
website. 93,5% of all websites which include structured data use only a single format.
3.7% of the websites contain RDFa alongside with Microformats, while only 1.5% use
Microdata together with Microformats. Less than 1% of the websites use Microformats
together with RDFa, or all three formats together.

In the following, we discuss the deployment of RDFa, Microdata and Microformats

in more detail.

5 RDFa Deployment

We discovered 519,379 websites that contain RDFa data, which means that 21% of all
websites that contain structured data use RDFa. The share of the websites that use RDFa
and belong to the Alexa 1 Million list is 7.55% (see Table 2). Examples of websites
from the Alexa top 100 list that use RDFa are the Internet Movie Database (IMDb), the
Microsoft news portal and also the website of the British Broadcasting Corporation.
Class/Property Frequency Distribution: In order to determine the topical areas of
the published data, we analyzed the vocabularies that are used together with RDFa.
Altogether, we discovered that only 98 different classes and 271 properties are used
by at least 100 different websites each. The class and property frequency distribution
is given in Fig. 1. The x-axis shows the classes and properties, ordered descending by
the number of websites that use them. The website count is plotted on the log-scaled
y-axis. The frequency of both, classes and properties, follows a long-tailed distribution,
i.e. a small number of classes/properties is used very frequently, while the remaining
classes/properties are used much less frequent.
Frequent Classes: In order to give an overview of the topical areas of the published
data, we analyzed how many websites use specific classes. Table 4 lists the most frequently used RDFa classes together with the number of websites using each class. The
namespaces of the classes are abbreviated with the corresponding prefix from the pre-
fix.cc list. In addition to the absolute usage count, the third column in the table shows
the relative class usage compared to all websites that embed RDFa. The 4th and 5th column show the usage of RDFa on websites that are contained in the Alexa 1 million list.
We see that 6 of the most frequently used classes belong to the Open Graph Protocol
(prefix: og), and thus to the Facebook ecosystem11. In addition we find classes which
belong to the topical area of e-commerce (products, offers, reviews, companies) as well
as blogging (blog, blogposts, comments). In the following, we discuss these areas in
more detail.

Facebook Data: The Open Graph Protocol (OGP) is developed and promoted by Facebook in order to enable the integration of external content into the social networking
platform. In contrast to RDFa, OGP allows the usage of literals instead of URIs to identify classes. For this reason we mark the names of OGP classes with quotes in Table 4.
The 3 most frequently used RDFa classes are the OGP classes og:"article", og:"blog"
and og:"website". In order to give an indication about the richness of the OGP data,
Table 5 shows the properties that are most frequently used together with the top 4 OGP
classes. As we can see, the frequent properties are rather generic and the same properties are used for all 4 classes. We see that the old OGP namespace ogo: that was
officially replaced by the new namespace ogm: in the mid of July 201012 is still more
frequently used than the new one (classes og:"article", og:"blog", and og:"product").
We can also observe that the OGP properties are not mixed with properties from other

non-Facebook-related vocabularies. Sites using one of the 3 OGP classes og:"article",
og:"blog" and og:"website" use on average 10,08 different properties (at least once).

Product Data: We identified three RDFa classes describing products, og:"product",
dv:Product, and gr:Offering, to occur on at least 500 different websites.

The most frequently employed class is og:"product" which is used by 19,107 websites
(cf. Table 4). The two other product-related classes, gr:Offering and dv:Product, appear
about 10 times less often than og:"product" with only 1,544 and 1,342 websites, respec-
tively. The www.data-vocabulary.org/ vocabulary (dv:) was introduced by Google and is
declared deprecated since June 2011 in favour of the schema.org vocabulary. gr:Offering
belongs to the GoodRelations vocabulary, an expressive vocabulary for representing e-
commerce related data. Analyzing the co-occurrence of gr:Offering with other classes
from the GoodRelations vocabulary, we found that gr:Offering co-occurs in 80.25% of
the websites together with gr:BusinessEntity. Furthermore, 54.92% of the 1,544 websites also contain gr:UnitPriceSpecification in addition to these two classes. The websites that employ gr:Offering use on average 27.68 different properties, while websites
employing og:"product" only use 10.3 different properties to markup their content.

Blog and Document Metadata: The list of the most frequently used RDFa classes
given in Table 4 contains 6 classes for annotating individual blog posts, comments,
and other article-like web content that is likely published with the help of a content
management system: og:"article", foaf:Document, sioc:Item, sioc:Post, sioct:BlogPost,
and sioc:Comment. As for products, we see a dominance of the Open Graph Protocol as og:"article" is used by 183,046 websites. Of the 49,252 websites using
the foaf:Document class, 66% also use sioc:Item . From the 33,141 websites using
sioc:Item, 99% also use of the foaf:Document class. Other sioc: classes did not show a
comparable high co-occurrence ratio. A possible explanation of the high co-occurrence

C. Bizer et al.

between sioc:Item and foaf:Document could be the Drupal 7 CMS. Drupal 7 is a widely
used web content management system which supports RDFa natively and marks every
page per default as both, a sioc:Item and a foaf:Document.13

Dublin Core: The dc: vocabulary is designed to represent metadata describing docu-
ments. We found RDFa encoded Dublin Core metadata to be provided by 63,668 websites within the Common Crawl corpus. The most commonly used Dublin Core property
is dc:title. It was found in 59,957 websites which equals 94.17% of all websites using
the dc: vocabulary. The second most employed property dc:date is embedded in only
20,768 websites.

Creative Commons: The cc: vocabulary defines properties for representing licensing information about Web content. The license information is for example used by
the Google Image Search to create filters for specific image usage rights. The Creative Commons vocabulary is used by 22,130 websites within the Common Crawl cor-
pus. The two most frequent properties are cc:attributionURL and cc:attributionName
which can be found on 20,195 respectively 20,069 different websites. Following up is
cc:morePermissions which is used by 4,158 websites.

6 Microdata Deployment

We found 140,312 websites that use Microdata (see Table 1), which means that 6.1% of
all websites including structured data use Microdata. The share of the websites that use
Microdata and belong to the Alexa Top 1000 list is 31.67% (see Table 2), meaning that
Microdata is more widely used by popular websites. Examples of websites from the
Alexa Top 100 list that use Microdata are the auction site eBay as well as the websites
of Microsoft Corporation and Apple Inc.

Class/Property Frequency Distribution: The frequency distribution of the Microdata
classes and properties is given in Fig. 2. The figure shows that only 86 classes and
487 properties are used on more than 100 websites. While the class count is similar to
the class count reported for RDFa (98 classes) in Section 5, the number of Microdata
properties used is about twice as large as the number of RDFa properties indicating that
Microdata annotations are on average more fine grained than RDFa annotations. Regarding the website counts, we observe a long-tailed distribution for classes and properties
which is similar to the RDFa distribution (see Fig. 1).

Frequent Classes: Table 6 shows the most frequently used Microdata classes. In addition to the absolute usage count, the third column in the table shows relative class
usage compared to all websites having embedded Microdata information. The 4th and
5th column show the usage of Microdata on websites that are contained in the Alexa
1 million list. We see that all frequently used classes either belong to the schema.org
vocabulary or the data-vocabulary.org vocabulary (dv:), that was declared deprecated
in 2011 in favor of schema.org. No classes from any other vocabulary are used together
with the Microdata syntax on more than 100 websites. In the following, we discuss the
main topical areas of the data.

Blog and Document Metadata: The class schema:BlogPosting is used by 25,235 websites making it the single most used Microdata class in our data set. The usage rate of
this class on all websites containing Microdata is 17.98%, meaning that it is about three
times higher than the usage rate on websites that belong to the Alexa 1 million list.

The class schema:Article is used on 15,718 websites (13.35%). This class is a superclass of schema:BlogPosting and can be used to identify any kind of articles including
newspaper and magazine articles. Schema.org also offers a specific class for annotating news articles. This class, schema:NewsArticle, was introduced in 2011 as a results
of a collaboration between schema.org and the International Press Telecommunication
Council, including companies like the New York Times, see [2]. This more specific class
is used by 1,047 websites within our corpus, see Table 6. Using co-occurrence analysis,
we found schema:NewsArticle to be used mostly in an isolated manner: Less than 1% of
the websites that use schema:NewsArticle also use a second class (e.g. schema:Person).

C. Bizer et al.

Regarding the properties which are used together with schema:NewsArticle, we discovered that in around 79% of the cases the title property is filled and on 66% of the
websites the schema:articleBody is used together with the class.

Navigational Information: The second most frequently used Microdata class is
dv:Breadcrumb which is used by 21,729 websites. Breadcrumbs describe the navigational structure of a website. The Breadcrumb data is used by search engines to provide shortcuts to sub-pages within their search result. The class is used by 23.13%
of the Alexa 1 Million websites using Microdata, but only by 15.49% of all websites
using Microdata, meaning that popular websites tend to employ datavoc:Breadcrumb
more frequently than others. A similar observation can be made for schema:WebPage
which describes a web page and can also contain navigational information via its
schema:WebPage/breadcrumb property.

Product Data: Reviewing all Microdata classes that are used by more than 100 different websites, we could identify four classes, i.e. schema:Product, schema:Offer,
dv:Product, and dv:Offer, that describe products and product offers, see Table 6. The
most frequently used product-related Microdata class is schema:Product which is used
by 16,612 websites and thus shows a similar adoption level than the top productrelated RDFa class, og:"product", see Table 5. Websites using the product-related
classes in the dv namespace employ on average 17.5 different properties, while sites
using the product classes in the schema.org namespace on average only make use
of 12 different properties. Table 7 lists the properties that are commonly used to describe schema:Products as well as other product-related classes. schema:Product/name,
schema:Product/description, schema:Product/image, and schema:Product/offers are
the most frequently used properties which are used by at least 45.42% of the websites.
The 26 other properties that are defined by schema.org for describing products are used
by significantly less websites.

We further investigated which other classes are used together with schema:Product
on the same website. The results are presented in Table 8 and reveal that only 43.31%
of the websites use schema:Product together with schema:Offer, the Schema.org class

for representing offer details like schema:Offer/price or schema:Offer/priceCurrency.
25.93% of the websites provide schema:AggregateRatings for their products.

Ratings: The schema.org vocabulary offers two classes for representing rating informa-
tion: schema:Rating for representing individual ratings and schema:AggregateRating
for representing summaries of multiple ratings. Within our corpus, 7,000 websites provide aggregate ratings while only 1,532 websites markup the rating values of individual reviews. Aggregate ratings refer to schema:Product on around 1/3 of the websites,
followed by schema:LocalBusinesses which are rated on 20% of the websites, and
schema:WebPages which are rated on around 10% of the websites. Sites using one
of the rating classes provide in average 19 to 20 properties on their pages. Examining the rating scales, we found that most websites use a 0-to-5 scale with the values
5, 4 and 0 being used most frequently. schema:Rating refers to schema:Product on almost 50% of the 1.532 websites, followed by schema:SoftwareApplication (8%) and
schema:LocalBusiness (7%).

Business Listings: The fifth most common Microdata class is schema:LocalBusiness
which is used by 16,383 websites (11.68% of all websites containing Microdata). The
class is used to describe a physical business like a shop or restaurant. 61.14% of the
websites that use schema:LocalBusiness also provide a schema:PostalAddress for the
business. The second most frequently co-occurring class is schema:Product (17.10%).

Job Postings: Resulting from a collaboration with the United States Office of Science and Technology Policy, schema.org started to provide vocabulary terms for describing job postings in the end of 2011, see [4]. We found 552 websites to use
the schema:JobPostings class. Among the websites using schema:JobPostings, almost all websites (94.75%) also provide job titles (schema:JobPosting/title). About
50% of the websites make use of the properties schema:JobPosting/jobLocation and
schema:JobPosting/description, and 40% give information about the hiring organizations using the property schema:JobPosting/hiringOrganization. Although schema.org
defines the range of schema:JobPosting/hiringOrganization to be schema:Organization,
over 60% of the websites use literals (like IBM and eBay) instead of instances of the class organization to identify the hiring organization. Other more specific properties to describe schema:JobPostings such as schema:JobPosting/skills or
schema:JobPosting/benefits are rarely used. The property schema:JobPosting/skills

C. Bizer et al.

is used only by 10% of all websites providing job postings and the property
schema:JobPosting/benefits only by 2%.

7 Microformat Deployment

Microformats are used on approximately 1.7 million websites making them the most
widely adopted markup format. 14.18% of the websites in the Alexa 1 Million list employ Microformats (see Table 2). Examples of websites from the Alexa Top 100 list
that use Microformats are the online encyclopedia Wikipedia, which uses a large number of different Microformats, the Adobe website, and the Taobao marketplace, one of
the most popular Chinese customer-to-customer online marketplaces.

Frequent Classes: Table 9 shows the most frequently used Microformat classes. The
last two columns of the table contain the number and percentage of Microformat websites that are included in the Alexa top 1 million list. The table shows that hCard is by
far the most widely used Microformat. Among others, hCard is used by the two microblogging platforms tumblr and twitter. The hCard type VCard is found in over 84% of
all websites that use Microformats, followed by the hCard sub-classes Organization and
Location. The second most widely deployed Microformat is hCalendar which is used
by around 37 thousand websites. This format is among others used by the networking
platform LinkedIn. The Microformats XFN and geo do not define classes and are thus
not included into Table 9. Almost half a million websites use XFN while 48 thousand
contain geo markup.

Co-occurrence of Microformats on the Same Website: 1.5 million websites use only
a single Microformat (83% of all websites using Microformats). Almost 300 thousand
(17%) websites use 2 formats, 9,428 (less than 1%) use 3 formats, 1,348 use 4 formats
and 123 use 5 different formats. 30 websites use more than 5 different Microformats (for
instance blogspot.com). Table 10 shows the most frequently co-occurring Microformats.
It is noticeable that hCard is used together with most of the other Microformats. This
fact is not really surprising as most other Microformat specifications rely on hCard for
describing persons or organizations.

HCard and XFN: The hCard root-class, VCard is used on over 1.5 million websites.
The hCard class Organization is used most frequently together with VCard on 195,493
websites. Table 11 lists the Top 5 properties that are used to represent VCard informa-
tion. We see that the provided descriptions are rather shallow and mostly only consist
of a name and maybe a link to a persons homepage.

The second most frequently deployed Microformat is XFN, which is used by 490,286
websites within our data set. Using a co-occurrence analysis, we discovered that in
almost 50% of all websites XFN relations (e.g. xfn:mePage) are used together with
VCard classes. To analyze which websites or systems do support XFN, we extracted
some of the pages containing relevant structured data. We found out that for instance
Wordpress14 automatically publishes XFN when users link to other blogs or friends
websites.

HCalendar: 37 thousand websites offer information using hCalendar. Out of these
websites, 44% also use the Microformat hCard, in particular the class VCard in order
to identify for instance event attendees or organizers.

HListing: HListing is a Microformat for annotating small-ads and classifieds. The format is used on 4,030 websites. From the websites employing hListing classes, around
80% also offer information about the price and over 70% do use the optional property
item with the two properties itemUrl and itemPhoto. Overall we found almost 3 thousand websites to offer detailed information about a listing (lister, item, price, itemUrl
and itemPhoto).

HRecipe: The hRecipe Microformat is used to annotate cooking recipes on websites.
We identified 3,278 websites offering structured data about recipes. Over 80% do list
ingredients for their recipes and 20% of the sites offer additional information like durations and nutrition information. 40% of the websites use hCard together with hRecipe
in order to include information about the authors of the recipes.

8 Related Work

In [9], Mika and Potter present an analysis of the deployment of RDFa, Microdata and
Microformats based on a sample of the crawl of the Bing search engine (3.2 billion
URLs, January 2012). The results of their study are mostly in line with our findings.
For instance, they identified structured data on 4.7% of the examined websites while
we found structured data on 5.64% of the websites. All our RDFa top classes listed
in (Table 4) are also contained in their top 20 RDFa classes (without considering the
Open Graph Protocol og: types, as Mika and Potter do not count them as RDFa classes).
The findings also differ in some points, as both crawls obviously are only subsets of the
whole Web and as the results are influenced by the crawling strategy employed by the
two different crawlers that were used to gather the corpora. An example of diverting
results is the number of websites that use foaf:Image: Mika and Potter report 30,903
websites for foaf:Image, compared to 44,644 websites according to our extraction. The
analysis presented in this paper goes beyond the analysis presented by Mika and Potter,
as we also analyze which properties are used to describe instances of popular classes
as well as the co-occurrence of classes and thus also provide an indication about the
richness and usefulness of the published data. A further difference between our work
and the study by Mika and Potter is that their results are not verifiable as the Bing
crawl is not publicly accessible. In contrast, the Common Crawl corpus, as well as our
extracted data is available for download and can be used for further research.

In [8], Mika presents statistics about RDFa and Microformats distribution based on
crawls from Yahoo!. The crawls date from 2008 to 2010 and are thus older than the
corpus analyzed in this paper. The numbers given in [8] are not aggregated by website and thus depend highly on the crawling strategy of the Yahoo! crawler. Additional
vocabulary-level statistics for the same Yahoo! crawl are provided by the W3C15. The
statistics confirm our finding on the wide adoption of the Open Graph Protocol.

The commercial company BuiltWith16 collects statistics about the deployment of
RDFa and Microdata on 1 million popular PLDs. They report 166,000 websites to contain RDFa while we discovered 519,000. For Microdata, they found 295,000 websites
while our data set only contains 140,000. As BuiltWith sells the lists of the websites
containing structured data, verifying their results is expensive.

The Sindice search engine17 collects data from the Web and allows the data to be
searched using keyword queries and to be queried using SPARQL. Sindice only extracts data from the HTML pages of websites that provide site maps. In addition to
data from HTML pages, Sindice also extracts data from WebAPIs and loads data sets

15 http://www.w3.org/2010/02/rdfa/profile/data/yahoo/
16 http://trends.builtwith.com
17 http://sindice.com/
?

?

?
from the Linked Data Cloud. Sindice mixes this data with the HTML-extracted data in
its index. Statistics18 about the Sindice index are thus not directly comparable with the
results presented in this paper. While we focus on wide coverage, Sindice focuses on
deeper crawling. Consequently, the Sindice index covers less websites than Web Data
Commons, especially for Microdata and Microformats. According to the Sindice statistics from March 30, 2013, the index contains RDFa from 420,409 websites, Microdata
from 20,920 websites and Microformats from 295,262 websites (HCard).

We already presented the Web Data Commons project and a preliminary analysis of
the extracted data as a short paper at the LDOW2012 workshop [7]. Compared to the
LDOW2012 paper, the analysis presented in this paper is based on a larger web crawl
(3 billion pages vs. 1.5 billion). The former paper did not present any class/property
co-occurrence analysis and also did not aggregate the extracted data by PLD, meaning
that the presented results are largely influenced by the crawling strategy of the Common
Crawl.

9 Conclusion

Our study has shown that RDFa, Microdata, and Microformats have all three found
considerable adoption on the Web and are being used by hundreds of thousands of
websites. The adoption is also global, as we were able to identify considerable amounts
of websites using the formats on all examined top-level-domains. Matching the websites
that provide structured data with the Alexa list of popular websites revealed that nearly
50% of the top 10,000 websites embed structured data.

Concerning the topical domains of the published data, we found out that the dominant domains are: persons and organizations (represented using all three formats), blogand CMS-related metadata (represented using RDFa and Microdata), navigational metadata (represented using RDFa and Microdata), product data (represented using all three
formats), and event data (represented using a Microformat). Additional topical domains
with smaller adoption include job postings (represented using Microdata) and recipes
(represented using a Microformat). The topics of the data, as well as the formats and
vocabularies used to represent the data, seem to be largely determined by the major
consumers the data is targeted at: Google, Facebook, Yahoo!, and Bing. For instance,
the examined RDFa data is dominated by the vocabulary promoted by Facebook, while
the examined Microdata is dominated by the vocabularies promoted by Google, Yahoo!,
and Bing via schema.org.

Concerning the structural richness of the published data, we found out that many
websites only use a small set of rather generic properties to describe entities. For ex-
ample, instances of the Open Graph Protocol class product are described using only
the properties title, url, site_name and description in most cases. The same is true for
instances of schema:Product for which 61.99% of the websites only provide a name
and a description despite of schema.org defining 26 additional properties to describe
products. This means that applications that for instance want to find out which websites
offer a specific product need to employ additional information extraction techniques on

18 http://sindice.com/stats/

C. Bizer et al.

these fields in order to gain a deeper understanding of their content (exact product type,
product features), following the promise that a little semantics goes a long way.

All data that we have extracted from the Common Crawl as well as further, more
detailed statistics about the adoption of the different formats are provided on the
WebDataCommons.org website. By publishing the extracted data, we hope on the
one hand to initialize further domain-specific studies by third parties. On the other hand,
we hope to lay the foundation for enlarging the number of applications that consume
structured data from the Web, as the URLs of the webpages that we identified to contain
a specific type of data can be used as seeds for topic-specific deeper crawls.
