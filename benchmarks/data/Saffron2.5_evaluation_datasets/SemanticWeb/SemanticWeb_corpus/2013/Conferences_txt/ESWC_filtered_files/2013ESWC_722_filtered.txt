Abstract. We are surrounding by sensor networks such as healthcare, home or 
environmental  monitoring,  weather  forecasting,  etc.  All  sensor-based  applications proposed are domain-specific. We aim to link these heterogeneous sensor 
networks to propose promising applications. Existing applications add semantics  to  the  sensor  networks,  more  specifically,  to  the  context,  rather  than  to  
the  sensed  data.  We  propose  an  architecture  to  merge  heterogeneous  sensor 
networks, convert measurements into semantic data and reason on them.

1  Motivation and Research Questions 

Sensor  networks  are  used  in  a  great  deal  of  realms  such  as  home  monitoring,  
environmental  monitoring (e.g.,  weather  forecasting),  health  monitoring (e.g., pa-
cemaker,  brain  waves),  vehicular  networks,  etc.  Each  application  focuses  on  a 
specific  sensor  network.  We  intent  to  link  these  existing  heterogeneous  sensor 
networks  to  provide  new  applications.  For  example,  by  merging  the  following 
sensor  networks:  the  smart  kitchen,  the  weather  forecasting  and  the  health  we 
could propose a recipe according to ingredients available in the kitchen, the weather  and  the  users  health  (diets,  diseases,  allergies,  emotional  state).  Merging  
heterogeneous sensor  networks is a difficult  task due to  heterogeneous protocols, 
heterogeneous data format and the lack of description of measurements. For exam-
ple, a temperature measurement is related to a body temperature or an outside tem-
perature,  with a body temperature we can deduce if the person is sick, this is not 
the case with the outside temperature. 

The main challenges of this motivating scenario are: (1) manage heterogeneous data  from  sensor  networks,  (2)  convert  sensor  measurements  into  semantic  data  using 
semantic web technologies and (4) reason on these semantic data.

State of the Art 

SensorMasher [1] and the SemsorGrid4env [2] projects both manipulate environmental sensed data. Coyle et al. [3] propose semantic sensor networks for smart homes. 
Sense2Web [4] is a Linked Data Platform to publish sensor data and to link them to 
existing resources on the Web. SWAP (Sensor Web Agent Platform) [5] extracts sensor data automatically. The SSN (Semantic Sensor Network) Ontology [6] describes 
sensors and their measurements. The following sensor ontologies are specific to environmental sensors and do no not focus on the type of the measurement and the unit: 
Csiro1  OntoSensor2,  Cesn3,  Sensei4,  SemSOS5,  OOSTethys6.  SenML  [7]  and  SWE 
(Sensor Web Enablement) [8] are protocols to retrieve sensor measurements. SenML 
is  a  lightweight  protocol,    SWE  is  more  difficult  to  deploy  but  provides  interesting 
services  to  manage  sensors  such  as  be  alerted  when  a  specific  event  occurred  by 
email.  Machine-to-Machine  (M2M)  means  that  computers  can  communicate  with 
each other without human intervention. The  M2M ETSI architecture [9] is an architecture to manage heterogeneous sensor networks and communication protocols. They 
propose to add semantics to the context rather than to the measurements.  

Existing  works  focus  on  a  specific  sensor  network:  smart  home,  smart  kitchen, 
weather  forecasting  or  environmental  monitoring.  They  design  a  domain  ontology 
without be linked to the existing ones and add semantics to the context (i.e., shut off 
the light is the room is empty). There are a numerous sensor ontologies and domain 
ontologies but they are designed without considering the existing ones and propose to 
add  semantics  to  the  context  rather  than  to  the  measured  data.  Further,  they  do  not 
provide  semantic-based  reasoning  (machine  learning  or  recommender  systems)  on 
measurements. 

Approach 

We propose an architecture (Fig. 1) to get sensor measurements (sensor gateways), to 
annotate  heterogeneous  measurements  with  semantics  (aggregation  gateways)  and 
reason  on  them  (semantic-based  applications).  Our  architecture  is  inspired  by  the 
M2M ETSI architecture. We have in mind a distributed architecture, and propose high 
energy treatments on the cloud computing if necessary. Our sensor gateways retrieve 
sensor  measurements  through  the  SenML  protocol.  Our  aggregation  gateways  
convert  sensed  data  into  semantic  measurements  using  semantic  web  technologies

(RDF,  RDFS,  OWL  and  domain  ontologies).  Semantic-based  applications  link  our 
semantic measurements to the Linked Open Data7 and perform reasoning (inference 
engine, rules, machine learning, recommender systems).

In our scenario, we have two aggregation gateways, the former stores semantic data  related  to  the  weather,  ingredients  and  health,  the  second  manages  semantic  data 
related  to  the  health  and  the  brain  waves.  Semantic-based  applications  merge  and 
query  aggregation  gateways  to  provide  new  services  such  as  suggest  the  menu  for 
dinner adapted to the weather, the season, available ingredients in the kitchen and the 
users health (diseases, diets, allergies, emotional state).  

We design the SenMESO (sensor Measurements Ontology)8 to convert automatically heterogeneous sensor measurements into semantic data. This ontology acts as a 
hub  to  merge  heterogeneous  measurements  and  domain  ontologies.  Our  ontology 
describes the measurement concept: a measurement has a name, a value, a unit and a 
type. SenMESO is linked to numerous domain ontologies to obtain additional infor-
mation: health (ontoreachir9), sensor (SSN10), meteo (AWS11), smart home (dogont12), 
emotion13,  etc.  We  aim  at  constructing  a  tool  to  update  automatically  this  ontology 
with other domain ontologies. Semantic measurements are linked to the linked Open 
Data to obtain additional information. An example is to link our food measurements 
to  the  SmartProduct14  datasets  defining  a  great  deal  of  ingredients  and  recipes.

We want to create a generic algorithm to reason on the heterogeneous semantic data 
using machine learning, recommender system and semantic tools. 

Research Methodology 

We designed the architecture at the beginning of the thesis and an ontology to convert 
heterogeneous measurements into semantic data. We evaluate our ontology by using 
it in the prototype implementation.  

Current steps are to work on the refinement of this architecture and the ontology. 
We are working on updating automatically this ontology with new domain ontologies. 
We are implementing a prototype to evaluate the components of our architecture (sen-
sor gateway, aggregation gateway) and the M2M applications. 

Future  steps  are  to  integrate  a  semantic-based  recommender  system  on  semantic 
measurements to propose applications as presented in the first section. Our prototype 
will  be  integrated  to  the  Com4Innov15  platform  deploying  a  real  architecture  with 
heterogeneous sensors and communication protocols (4G). Finally,  we  will evaluate 
the performance of the prototype and the real architecture, more precisely, algorithms 
implemented to aggregate, convert sensed data and reason on them. 

Results 

We  have  implemented  a  first  prototype  to  validate  the  proposed  architecture.  The 
sensor  gateways16  retrieve  raw  measurements  and  return  them  according  to  the 
SenML protocol. We obtain simple measurements: the name, the value, the unit, and 
the date (i.e., the temperature is 5C, 250 grams of butter).  The aggregation gateways 
convert XML data into RDF data. We have implemented the SenMESO ontology to 
annotate  measurements  with  semantics.  The  M2M  applications  reason  on  semantic 
measurements to propose an application as the one presented in the first section. The 
architecture  has  been  implemented  with  the  following  technologies:  the  Java  lan-
guage,  Google  Application  Engine  (GAE),  the  Jena  framework,  HTML5  and  Java-
Script. Both the prototype and the ontology are available online17.  The final version 
of the prototype will be integrated to the Com4Innov project, to test it in a real environment with heterogeneous sensors and protocols. 

Conclusion and Future Works 

We  proposed  to  merge  heterogeneous  semantic  sensor  networks.  We  annotate  measurements with semantics rather than add semantics to the context. Currently, we are

working  on  the  refinement  of  the  architecture,  the  distributed  aspect  and  the  imple-
mentation. Future works are to integrate semantic-based machine learning algorithms 
and  recommender  systems  to  reason  on  heterogeneous  semantic  measurements.  We 
are also interesting in the security aspects. We are designing a semantic-based security application18 to help a non-expert in security to secure his/her application, by suggesting the best security mechanism to use.
