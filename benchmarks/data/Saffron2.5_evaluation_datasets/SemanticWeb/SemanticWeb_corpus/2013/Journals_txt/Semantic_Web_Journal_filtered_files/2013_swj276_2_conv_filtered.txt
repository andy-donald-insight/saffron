Abstract. The publication of public sector information (PSI) data sets has brought to the attention of the scientific community
the redundant presence of location based context. At the same time it stresses the inadequacy of current Linked Data services
for exploiting the semantics of such contextual dimensions for easing entity retrieval and browsing. In this paper we describe
our Linked Data representation of the NUTS European statistical subdivision, created to support the e-government and public
sector in publishing their data sets. The topological knowledge published in the Linked NUTS can be reused in order to enrich
the geographical context of other data sets, in particular in a scenario where statistical data sets describe information that have
strong ties with the territory, and therefore with its geography.

1. Introduction

Public Sector Information (PSI) has been recognized as the single largest source of information in Eu-
rope1, and the European Union (EU) has supported its
public access and reuse since the PSI Directive of 2003
[2].

The publication of authoritative geographies by local governments can open interesting scenarios for
exploiting topological knowledge in contextualising
the information sources published. For example, the
geoservice implemented within the EnAKTing
project, increases the recall of the information re-

trieval of our backlinking service [4] by considering topological containment between regions. Examples of authoritative geographies already published in
linked data format are the administrative geography of
Great Britain [5] by the Ordnance Survey (OS hence-
forth) and the statistical geography from Office of National Statistics.

The Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics
[3] (NUTS from the french name of the scheme) was
established by Eurostat at the beginning of 1970s, to
provide a single uniform breakdown of territorial units
for the production of regional statistics for the European Union. Each region at the same level is either the
expression of a political will or meant to provide comparable features at statistical level (e.g. similar geographical or socio-economic requirements) in order to
make comparison and analysis. The NUTS nomencla-

ture serves different purposes in the political life of the
European Union. It drives the collection, development
and harmonization of statistics through the community as well as supporting a consistent analysis of the
collected data. NUTS is also used for the purposes of
appraising eligibility for aid from the structural funds
from EU.

The current version of the NUTS nomenclature subdivides the territory of the European Union into 97 regions of level 1, 271 regions of level 2, and 1303 regions at level 3. Below that, two levels of Local Administrative Units (LAU) have been defined. The upper
LAU level 1 (formerly NUTS level 4) is defined only
for the following countries: Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czech
Republic, Estonia, Finland, Greece, Hungary, Ireland,
Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Poland, Por-
tugal, Slovenia, Slovakia and the United Kingdom.
The LAU level 2 (formerly NUTS level 5) consists of
around 120.000 municipalities or equivalent units in
the 27 EU Member States (as of 2007).

Since the NUTS nomenclature encodes a subdivision of a territory that is subject to frequent changes,
it is expected to change accordingly. Demographical
as well as political and economical indicators in fact
evolve yearly making geopolitical tools suddenly ob-
solete. The NUTS nomenclature in fact, during the last
decade, has been revised every three or four years in
order to represent new member states and to update the
local changes in administrative subdivisions (adminis-
trative regions can cease to exist, be split or aggregated
to serve local governments policies).

In this paper we present Linked NUTS, a linked
data set containing the Nomenclature of Territorial
Units for Statistics in RDF format. The Linked NUTS
represents not only the geographical hierarchy of regions but also its modifications over time, an important
prerequisite in order to correctly aggregate and represent statistical data sets for European countries. The
creation of the Linked NUTS data set was motivated
by the lack at the time (i.e. August 2010) of an adequate linked data representation of statistical regions
covering the life time of the available data.

2. Related data sets

During the years, many data sets representing the
NUTS nomenclature have been published as linked
data. Not all of these data sets contain the same kind
of information or provide the same kind of access to
the RDF documents. The main data sets describing the

NUTS are described in the following sections. A description of the proposed Linked NUTS will be provided in Section 3.

2.1. Eurostat (FUB)

The Freie Universitat Berlin has republished a portion of the geographical data provided by the Eurostat in structured format as Linked Data2. The data
set contains a list of countries, groups of countries
like the EU, and regions of Europe (one of the latest versions of the NUTS). The entities are resolvable via content negotiation in RDF/XML format and a
SPARQL endpoint is provided. There is no clear ontological commitment of the data, containment relations
are expressed only between a region and its country
of belonging despite the various levels of containment
that are present in the NUTS nomenclature. Furthermore regions descriptions provide no indication of the
time validity of the statistical observation.

2.2. NUTS-RDF

GeoVocab.org has published the latest version of the
latest NUTS nomenclature as linked data3 in which
are included countries like Norway and Turkey, not
present in previous versions. Note that there is only one
version of the NUTS nomenclature and no temporal
validity is provided for the represented regions.

The entities are resolvable via content negotiation in
RDF/XML and Turtle format but no API or SPARQL
endpoint is provided. A data dump is provided for each
version of the data set (two versions are provided so
far).

This data set mainly provides three kind of informa-
tion: topological relationships with other regions (not
only NUTS), alignment towards other data sets, and
shape information. The vocabulary used to describe
the topology is the NeoGeo Spatial Ontology whose
semantics is based on RCC8 [1] while the regions
shapes are provided in a range of formats (e.g. KML
and RDF).

dataset/nuts-geovocab

2.3. Eurostat NUTS dump

The Eurostat provides itself an RDF dump of the
2008 version of the NUTS4. Unfortunately the URIs
for the single regions are hash based and the download
of the whole file which defines the whole nomenclature is required every time an entity is resolved. In this
dump only the hierarchical structure and the labels are
provided.

2.4. EIONET

The European Environment Information and Observation Network (EIONET for short) provides a linked
data representation of the NUTS nomenclature5.

The entities are resolvable via content negotiation
only, providing documents in RDF/XML and Turtle
format. The represented entities provide only topological information and labels but no temporal validity is
expressed in the data set.

3. Linked NUTS data set

Within the research activities of the EnAKTing
project6 many data sets has been published as linked
data and in all of them, geographical entities were
used. In order to extend to the whole EU the same
support provided by the OS ontology and the services
developed we published the Linked NUTS data set7.
In Linked NUTS, every region in the nomenclature
is available as an HTTP resolvable URI only. The URIs
from the data set follow the following regex pattern:

http://nuts.psi.enakting.org/id/.+
From the main page it is possible to access the links
to the Eurostat pages which contain the data used to
generate the linked data representation. The Eurostat
releases the data using an open license with attribution (same license for the boundaries served by the
geoservice). The Linked NUTS releases the data
following an Open Data Commons Attribution license.
By using the content negotiation mechanism, user
agents can specify the format of preference and retrieve a document in either RDF/XML or Turtle. When

asking for a representation of an NUTS region, clients
are redirected via HTTP 303 to a document describing
the resource identified by the initial URI; for example:

http://nuts.psi.enakting.org/id/UKG32
describes the NUTS 3 region of Solihull, in the
West Midlands. When we request the Turtle document describing such entity (e.g. curl -L -G -H
"Accept: application/x-turtle" http:
//nuts.psi.enakting.org/id/UKG32) we
are redirected to the URL of the Turtle document
(i.e. http://nuts.psi.enakting.org/id/
UKG32/ttl) which contains the RDF document describing the entity (see Figure 1). RDF/XML documents URIs will be postfixed with /rdf and HTML
documents with /doc.

The Linked NUTS data set contains a total of 2068
regions of different levels, many of which span different versions of the nomenclature. In fact we can count:
1, 342 regions for the first version; 1, 436 the second;
1, 779 for the third and fourth version. We can count
therefore many regions that are valid for more than
one version. The definition of the NUTS regions, except the alignment towards Freebase, counts 17, 700
triples, 13, 362 of which employ an object property
(rdf:type included) and only 4, 338 triples employ
a datatype property.

The version of NUTS currently covered by this data
set does not include the newest version, released the
1st of January 2012. Since the updates to the nomenclature are infrequent any change to the data set is decided on a per request basis.

3.1. Vocabularies used

From the Turtle document shown in Figure 1 we can
see that every NUTS region has associated: a code (the
one assigned by the NUTS nomenclature), a temporal validity, topological information, an alignment towards the linked data cloud, and one or more links to
a shape.

Topological relationships between NUTS regions
are described using the OS spatial ontology8 whose
semantics is based on region connection calculus
RCC8 [1]. At the time of creation of the Linked NUTS
data set, the OS spatial ontology was the most used vocabulary for describing topological relationships. It is
in fact used not only to describe the administrative and

electoral subdivisions in UK, but the statistical subdivisions too.

Moreover, since http://data.gov.uk already
provides the URIs for the further two levels of the
British statistical geography, the level 3 NUTS regions
for the UK contain one or more LAU level 1 regions
from such source. For example, in Figure 1, the region
of Solihull contains a number of LAU regions already
published by the UK government (e.g. Bickenhill as
ward:00CTFT, Blythe as ward:00CTFU etc.).

One dimension although is not represented in the
OS spatial ontology, the temporal extent of a given
geographical subdivision. Dublin Core provides the
means for defining temporal validities of documents
although the way to encode time spans make use of
Literals and it is not based on any framework. In order
to describe temporal validity for the NUTS regions, an
entity has been created for each one of the version of
the NUTS, starting from the gentlemens agreement of
1999.

Every NUTS region can be valid in one or more versions of the nomenclature, and every version of the
nomenclature is represented as an instance of an OWL
Time Interval (for example nuts:v1 in Figure 1)
and the property enakting:validity links every
region to the version of the nomenclature valid for the
region code. When a new version of the nomenclature
is released, only the definition of the last temporal interval is updated by setting a precise date for the interval end. For all the codes that remain unchanged in the

new version, only a new triple is added for sanctioning
the extended validity of the code (for example in Figure 1 the region of Solihull is valid for all the four versions of the nomenclature). Otherwise the code ceases
to be valid, superseded by one or more new regions.

OWL Time ontology has been chosen because it
provides a light framework, but with a well founded se-
mantics, for describing temporal entities. Since a ver-
sion, in the data set, is represented as a temporal interval it seemed natural to adopt such ontology.

In order to represent the reorganization of regions
in the nomenclature, we defined two additional properties to describe operations over the nomenclature. The
transformations of regions after each reorganization
of the nomenclature are represented with two proper-
ties: enakting:merge, and enakting:split.
A merge is the operation that erase two or more regions from the nomenclature to replace them with a
new region, and split is the inverse operation.

Linked NUTS provides also the shape files for the
fourth version of the NUTS nomenclature (i.e. the one
valid from 2009 until 2012) which was the latest version at the time of the data set creation. It does so
by linking a NUTS region with the geoservice9
developed within EnAKTing project [4]. The shape
files are available for all the EU regions mentioned
in the NUTS version 4, from the country level (i.e.
NUTS 0) to the most granular (i.e. NUTS level 3).

9http://geoservice.psi.enakting.org/

The geoservice provides shape files in two for-
mats, KML and GeoJSON, and the user can decide
what format retrieve by using content negotiation or by
referring explicitly to the desired document.
3.2. Linked NUTS alignment via owl:sameAs

The latest version of the Linked NUTS has been
aligned towards the Linked Data cloud, and the alignments have been deployed via the sameas10 service.
The alignment has been performed using the Google
Refine11 tool against the Freebase data set and manually checked for errors. The initial alignment provided
by Freebase reconciliation service left 230 regions out
of 1, 351 not aligned, further 350 regions have been
manually aligned using Freebase search functional-
ities. In total, the alignment counts 1, 106 matches
(roughly 82% of all regions). Both alignments, automatic and manual, have been manually checked for
correctness.

The choice of aligning the data set to Freebase only
is due to the fact that Google Refine provides only this
data set as target for reconciliation. However, this is
not a limitation since Freebase is only the entry point
to the linked data cloud. In fact, via the sameas ser-
vice, which computes and manages the equivalence
bundles for aligned resources, it is possible to retrieve equivalent entities from many different domains.
For example, resolving the following URL http://
sameas.org/text?uri=http://nuts.psi.
enakting.org/id/UKG32 we are able to retrieve
almost 60 equivalent entities:

Average and standard deviation for equivalent URIs distribution

Table 1

level


Once the data set has been aligned to other entities
in the Linked Data cloud, it is interesting to see how
regions of different size are represented in other data
sets. We gathered therefore instance equivalence information using the sameas service and run some anal-
ysis.

It is worth to note that the sameas service considers as equivalent entities that are related by
properties other than owl:sameAs, but whose semantics are close to it (e.g. skos:exactMatch,
skos:closeMatch, umbel:isLike, etc.).
In
particular, for DBpedia, redirects from one resource
URI to another (i.e. dbprop:redirect) are considered to be equivalence statements. It is then up to
the data consumer to decide if the semantics provided
by the sameas service are good enough, or whether it
instead requires a further step of data filtering to take
into account only certain types of equivalences.

Figure 2(a) reports the number of regions per level
(dark grey bars) and the number of equivalent URIs
for those regions (light grey bars). Despite the growing
trend illustrated by Figure 2(a), the average number of
equivalent URIs decreases as we proceed to lower levels of the subdivision (i.e. smaller regions) as depicted
in Figure 2(b). This tells us that the regions belonging
to level 0 of the NUTS subdivision (i.e. countries) are,
not surprisingly, the most represented in the Linked
Data cloud. Figure 2(b) shows the distribution of the
average number of equivalent URIs for a region in two
cases: considering the case where there are no equivalents as 0, and considering only those regions that have
at least one equivalent region (dropping therefore the
0 cases). In both cases the trend vaguely resembles a
logarithmic distribution where the bigger the region is,
the more equivalent URIs can be retrieved for integrating information, and if we compute then the mean and
standard deviation of this distribution we can clearly
see an inverse trend happening for the standard deviation (see Table 1).

Considering that the integration task usually includes a phase where equivalent regions URIs are resolved in order to join pieces of information from the
returned documents, we can consider the distributions

(a) Number of equivalent URIs by NUTS level

(b) Average number of equivalent URIs by NUTS level

Fig. 2. NUTS entity equivalence statistics

in Table 1 as an indicator of how manageable the integration process could be. For countries in fact (see
Table 1, level 0), the standard deviation is very high,
indicative of the fact that the data is very sparse and
therefore difficult to estimate. For smaller regions the
distribution of the equivalent entities converge to a normal distribution with a standard deviation considerably
smaller than the previous case. Assuming a normal distribution we can then estimate the expected amount of
data to collect from the WoD, making the data collection phase more predictable. We can then conclude
that the more fine grained the region is, the more predictable the data collection for that region will be.

4. Conclusions

We have presented in this paper a linked data version
of the NUTS statistical geography and how it is linked
to external geographical entities in the cloud and to
internal services that enrich the description of the re-
gions. An important aspect represented in this data set,
which differentiates it from other NUTS representa-
tions, is the temporal extent of geographical subdivisions which has changed frequently during the years.
New entities can be defined, old ones can be abolished
or change status, and this is true for many kind of geog-
raphy. For example, in the UK administrative geogra-
phy, Southampton, once part of Hampshire, became a
Unitary Authority on the 1st of April 1997. Since then,
Southampton has been administratively detached from
the county of Hampshire (i.e. not contained any more),
although being still part of it as a ceremonial county.

Versioning of information resources is an important
aspect in linked data community and it is even more

important when publishing Public Sector Information,
whose content and validity must be put into context.
Within the EnAKTing project we experienced how dynamic the geographical information in governmental
data sets can be. We therefore considered beneficial for
the community to mint reference URIs for all of the
NUTS regions, current and past, providing enough information to reconcile and exploit European statistical
data sets over a considerable span of time.

In case of British governmental data, the use of coreference systems allowed us to exploit the knowledge created in one organization (the OS administrative ontology) in different, and potentially novel,
data collections, overlapping a qualitative spatial dimension that was not present before [4]. The creation
of services like the sameas, the geoservice, and
the backlinking service enable us to reuse local
knowledge (topological containment for example) in
different contexts. Posing at the same time many questions about the quality management of the knowledge
and the entity alignments used; what kind of classification to use, and which alignments to trust.
