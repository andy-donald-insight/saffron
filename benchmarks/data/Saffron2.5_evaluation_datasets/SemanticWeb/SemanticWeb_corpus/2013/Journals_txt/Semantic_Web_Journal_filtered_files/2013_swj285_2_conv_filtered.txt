Abstract.

The BookSampo dataset provides information as linked data on fiction literature published in Finland going back to the 15th
century, along with rich descriptions of both their content and context. The dataset contains data on nearly 400,000 subjects,
including literary works, authors, book covers, reviews, awards, images, and movies, over 3 million triples in total. The data
has been applied as the basis of the BookSampo portal in public use in Finland, and is aligned with the cross-domain cultural
heritage contents and ontologies of CultureSampo, another in-use semantic portal. The data has been used to answer complex
questions, such as what topics should one write about, if one wants to get a literary award (based on statistics). The metadata
was transformed into RDF from legacy library databases, then enriched manually by dozens of librarians in a Web 2.0 fashion in
Finnish public libraries, and is constantly updated at a rate of some new 90,000 triples monthly.

1. Introduction

The role of public libraries as a source for fiction literature remains strong even if their role as a provider of
factual knowledge has diminished [11]. This encourages libraries to improve their services related to fiction literature. However, the nature of fiction necessitates a departure from old library indexing traditions.
Classifying books e.g. by their genre and shelf location alone is not enough: studies on user needs in fiction literature show that satisfactory fiction literature
indexing systems must also model and store the rich
connections between fiction literature works, their au-
thors, and their surrounding cultural context [10].

The BookSampo project is a joint venture by the
Finnish public libraries and semantic web researchers

*Corresponding author. E-mail: eetu.makela@aalto.fi

to provide such a system using Linked Data. For the
end-users of public libraries, the project manifests
as http://www.kirjasampo.fi/, a portal for finding and
browsing rich interlinked information about fiction [6].
This paper however describes the dataset underlying
the system, an experiment in developing and using rich
Linked Data as a basis for fiction literature services.

2. Core Dataset Information

The BookSampo dataset is located on the web in an
instance of the SAHA RDF-based metadata editor [5].
SAHA is used by the librarians for maintaining the
dataset, and it also provides a SPARQL end point to the
data, as well as RDF export functionality. The relevant
web addresses are:

SPARQL Endpoint

The scope of the BookSampo data is all fiction literature published in Finland in Finnish or Swedish1,
be they original or translated. Originally, the data in
BookSampo came from a June 2009 dump from the
Helsinki metropolitan area library system, converted
into RDF. Newly published material after that is downloaded and automatically converted each night from
BTJ Finland Ltd, a company that provides these descriptions to Finnish library systems for a price. How-
ever, both of these data sources are still very bibliographically oriented. The value of BookSampo comes
from the fact that dozens of librarians around Finland
constantly collaboratively edit and improve the data
loaded into BookSampo using the SAHA metadata ed-
itor. This effort has made the sparse metadata about
older literature in the library systems richer, and more
importantly, extended the metadata to cover related ob-
jects, such as awards, publishers, reviews etc. For this
purpose, additional datasets (authority databases, book
covers, reviews, etc.) were also converted into RDF
and aligned with the basic bibliographic records.

Unfortunately, the diverse origins of the data in
BookSampo create problems in unambiguously licensing the complete dataset. The data of the Helsinki
metropolitan area library system, still making up the
bulk of the combined dataset, has been released under
the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 1.0 li-
cence. For the other library databases transformed and
the manual work done by the librarians, clear licencing
was never agreed upon, other than an informal agreement of no strings attached. However, the company
BTJ Finland Ltd does claim a right on the annotations
flowing in from their system. Thus, when the dataset
has previously been used by outsiders, either all data
on literary works since June 2009 has been evicted, or
permission for the use has been sought from BTJ.

At the time of writing, the dataset contains a little over 3 million triples, pertaining to nearly 400,000
subject URIs. Nearly 2 million of the triples have URIs
as property values (objects), testifying to the richness
of the semantic network formed. The dataset currently
grows with a rate of approximately 90,000 triples and
10,000 subject URIs per month. Of the literals in
the RDF database, some 560,000 are without a lan-

Swedish, and 36,000 in English, with other languages
evident in much smaller numbers.

3. Contents of and Links Outside the Dataset

The important classes in use in BookSampo along
with their approximate instance counts are given in Table 1. Besides these core classes, there are a number
of auxiliary types for the ranges of annotation fields,
such as professions, schools, and time periods. In addition to local resources, the project also makes use of
external vocabularies for these fields. These also act as
semantic glue that allows the project to reach past its
own boundaries into other linked datasets, and into the
wider cultural historical context it seeks.

Most external references are to the KOKO lightweight

class ontology [4], a central part of the Finnish semantic web infrastructure, currently comprised of 14
domain ontologies joined under the Finnish national
upper ontology YSO2. A particularly used part of
KOKO is the KAUNO fiction content indexing ontol-
ogy, which was transformed from the Finnish-Swedish
thesaurus Kaunokki-Bella3 into RDF, changed manually into a simple RDF(S) ontology, and aligned with
YSO for use in the BookSampo project.

In addition to KOKO, the project also makes use
of the LEXVO language ontology4, the Getty Union

2http://www.yso.fi/onki3/en/overview/yso
3http://www.kirjastot.fi/fi-FI/kaunokkibella/
4http://www.lexvo.org/

List of Artist Names5 with different spellings of artists
names, birth and death information, and so on, and a
unified place ontology termed KOKO-Place, which includes 17 million locations with coordinate information gathered from sources such as GeoNames6, DB-
Pedia7, OpenStreetMap8, and the National Land Survey of Finland place name database9.

Looking at the dataset from a viewpoint of linking
to the dataset from an international context, promising points of entry are the places and the actors, as
they are not language bound and already to an extent use URIs from international datasets. As for the
KOKO class ontology, there are some, mostly automatically created mappings to, for example, the Getty
AAT thesaurus10, Wordnet, and DBPedia. However,
their quality has not yet been evaluated. For creating
such mappings by oneself, the YSO upper ontology
(ca. 25,000 concepts) of KOKO has labels for virtually
all concepts in Finnish, Swedish, and English, while
the KAUNO part has labels primarily only in Finnish
and Swedish.

The BookSampo dataset has grown organically over
several years using different tools, so the user should
be aware of a few conventions, or lack thereof: First,
practices and languages vary regarding minting URIs
for classes, instances, and properties. However, all the
schema properties and classes have labels in Finnish,
Swedish, and English. Second, the schema definitions
in the dataset violate RDFS semantics in one major
aspect: properties may have multiple separate domain
and range constraint statements, but this doesnt imply that the instances related by these properties are
members of the intersection of domain/range classes,
as required in the RDF Schema specification. Instead,
the domain/range definitions are used with the interpretation that the union of the class restrictions applies.
For example, dc:description may then have as its domain restriction two non-intersecting classes for literary works and authors. This unfortunate modeling error is due to the use of the externally developed SAHA
metadata editor, which relies on this mis-interpretation
and does not adequately support for example using ab-

4. The BookSampo Data Model

The central objects in BookSampo, around which
the others cluster, are books and authors. For authors,
the schema currently defines nineteen object properties
and five literal properties, listed in Table 2. A lions
share of properties have object references as values.

Table 2 also shows how both shared ontologies as
well as local additions are used for drawing concepts
for property values. However, any local terms should
be linked to the ontology framework through defining
their ontological superclass. This way, for example, the
occupation specialized nurse which was lacking in
the shared KOKO ontology, could be added, while still

linking it to the nurse concept in the ontology, and
through that to the other medical staff already there.

The author schema has gone through one major revision during the project: the way of encoding biographical information was changed from events to attributes.
Initially, details about, among others, the times and
places of authors births, deaths and studies were represented in BookSampo as events, in the spirit of the
cultural heritage interchange model CIDOC-CRM [2]
and the BIO-schema of biographical information [1].
User research, as well as interviewing library indexers revealed, however, that events as primary content
objects are not easily understood by those indexing
them, or by end-users on a cognitive level. Bringing
events to the fore, the approach fractured and distributed the metadata of the original primary objects.
For example, people wanted much more to see information on authors birth and death dates and places as
simply attribute-object values of the author, instead of
as events where the author was involved in.

While it would have been of course possible to craft
user interfaces which reintegrated this information on
the view level, this would have required specialized
support from all participating editing and viewing sys-
tems. As such systems were not readily available and
the benefits of the event model were deemed minor,
the project changed back to a more traditional model,
where data about times and places of occurrences are
directly saved as author, not event attributes. In the
case of representing academic degrees attained by au-
thors, this did lead to some loss of data, since the flat
attributes allowed only representation of multiple degrees without dates. However, the librarians deemed
the simplicity to outweigh the costs in this situation.

In the BookSampo schema for literary works, it
was important to be able to describe both properties
relating to the content of the work, which stays the
same in all translations and editions, and at the same
time also to index edition-specific information, such
as translators, publishers, and publication years. Here,
the project draws from the FRBRoo Model [9], which
identifies four conceptual levels, among which the different properties of a work can be divided:

1. Work. The abstract contents of the workthe platonic idea

of the work (primary creator, keywords).

2. Expression. The concrete contents of the workoriginal /
translated text, stage script, and film script (author, translator,
and director).

3. Manifestation. The concrete work/productbook, compilation book, entire concept of a stage performance and film
DVD (publisher, issuer and ISBN).

4. Item. The physical copysingle book, compilation, perfor-

mance, DVD.

The idea in the model is that a single abstract conceptual work may be written down in different texts,
which may then be published in multiple editions, each
comprised of a multitude of physical copies. Each type
of item down the scale inherits the properties given on
the levels above it. Translated into indexing work, this
means that, for example, the content of a work need
be described only once, with each different language
edition merely referring to the resource describing the
qualities of the abstract works printed therein.

After what had been learnt from the biography
schema, it was not deemed desirable to replace a simple flat model with the complexity of four entire levels.
Also, more generally, experience had proven that the
BookSampo indexing model focusing on the contents
of the work was already quite a leap to librarians, who
were thus far mostly familiar with single level indexing of mostly manifestation level information. Since
data in BookSampo never reaches the level of a single item, it was easy to simply drop the item level.
On the other hand, the work level had to be kept sep-
arate, so translations in different languages could refer to the same content keywords. It was decided, how-
ever, to combine the expression and manifestation lev-
els, since, one translation has on the average one publisher and physical form, and repetitive descriptions
would hence not be needed on a large scale.

As a result, works are described at two levels: 1) as
an abstract work, which refers to the contents of the
work, which is the same in all translations and ver-
sions, and 2) as a physical work, which describes features inherent to each translation or version. This way
it is possible to demonstrate, for example, that Hopealaiva and Nostromo are both Finnish translations of Nostromo, a Tale of the Seaboard by Joseph
Conrad. For a listing of the fields used to describe an
abstract work, see Table 3, while the fields relating to
the physical work are presented in Table 4.

While it can be argued that not using the whole
FRBR model diminishes the interoperability of the
content in BookSampo with regard to other FRBR col-
lections, it turns out that also others have come to a
similar simplification of the model, particularly in systems where distributed editing and understandability
of content is important, as opposed to for example
systems doing automatic conversion of library records

to FRBR. For example, the Open library11 recognizes
work and edition levels, with the latter also combining expression and manifestation. Exactly the same
situation is present also in the LibraryThing portal12,
only naming the entities as work and book. On the
other hand, even systems that claim to support separate expression level items on their data model level,
such as The Australian Music Centre13, and the OCLC
WorldCat system14, do not allow these to be shown
or searched for independently of their linked work or
manifestation entities in their actual user interfaces,
thus further corroborating that at least from an enduser perspective, the distinction between an expression
and a manifestation is not very important.

It has also already been established by others that
separation of expressions from even originally combined fields is possible by mostly automated processing along with manual correction [3,8]. If a need for
further separation arises, then one could just repeat a
similar split procedure for the BookSampo data.

A minor problem in this model was how to represent short stories and their relationship with short story
collections. Here, each short story has an abstract work
level, which is embodied as a part of a physical
work. This part of a physical work is then included
in a physical work, which in turn is the embodiment
of the short story collection as an abstract work. This
solution is depicted in a more visual form in Figure 1.
This way both the individual short story and the
short story collection overall may separately have content keywords. Whereas most of the data at the manifestation level belongs to the physical work of the short
story collection, the data of an individual short story at
the expression level, e.g. details of the translator, the
name in the collection or page numbers, belong to the
part of the physical work. This same structure is also
applied to other similar part-object instances, for example single poems in poem collections.

Eetu Makela), Kaisa Hypen, and Eero Hyvonen / Fiction Literature as Linked Open Data

The tables describing the fields of the abstract and
physical works show that both their content and context are richly described in BookSampo. However, to
fully appreciate the network formed, one must also
look at what information is given about the secondary
resources mentioned. The details about the author, of
course linked to all their works, have already been dis-
cussed. The schemas of the other secondary resources
are described in Table 5.

Here is evident also one area where the RDF data
model caused problems. For the most part, the model
is simple. Each resource describes an independently
existing thing, such as a book, award, author, or a
place, that has relationships with other things. How-
ever, sometimes a particular resource actually doesnt
correspond to an independently existing, understandable thing. This happens in cases where a relation has
metadata of its own, such as when one wants to record
the year in which a book has been given an award,
or the serial number of a book in a series. In RDF,
these situations are usually resolved by creating the
link through an auxiliary resource (blank node), where
this information can be recorded. In the BookSampo
schema, for example, to say that a book is part 7 in
the Yellow Library series, one must relate it to the
part of series resource Part 7 in the Yellow Li-
brary, which is in turn annotated as a part of the Yellow Library series resource and having the part number of 7. This caused problems because these auxiliary
resources appeared to the indexers exactly like normal resources, yet their function was differenti.e.,
it doesnt really make sense to think that Part 7 of
the Yellow Library series exists in any sense separate
from the book that holds that place in the series. In our
system, there was no way around using these auxiliary
resources for certain things, but their use certainly did
muddy the primary concept of the graph model to the
detriment of the indexers. Luckily, in practice the effects of this could be somewhat mitigated by training
and annotation instructions.

5. Use Cases for the BookSampo Dataset

The original use case for the BookSampo data is
in the BookSampo portal, which provides an end-user
view into the database. The dataset has also already
been used in a context outside the original environment
it was designed for, providing concrete examples on
what can be done with the data. First, the dataset has
been aligned with both the domain ontologies as well

Second, On May 23, 2011, the major Finnish newspaper Helsingin Sanomat organized an open data hacking
event, which utilized the BookSampo database through
its SPARQL endpoint. The analyses and visualization
of the materials revealed, for example, that international detective stories have become longer since the
beginning of the 1980sfrom an average of 200 pages
to 370 pagesbut Finnish detective stories did not become longer until the 2000s. It also became possible to
discover which themes were popular in fiction at various times. Other results combined BookSampo data
with external grant data, showing for example what
types of topics most likely receive grant funding or
awards. New interactive applications were also cre-
ated, showing which years were statistically similar
from a publishing viewpoint, or locating the places associated with Finnish fiction on a map.

6. Discussion and Future Work

This paper described the BookSampo dataset, a joint
venture between semantic web researchers and Finnish
public libraries, where dozens of librarians have taken
part in curating and creating a large body of semantically rich knowledge centered around fiction literature.
The utility of the dataset has also already been verified
in multiple contexts. However, there is also still much
that could be done to add value to the dataset aside
from the continual incremental improvements being
done by the volunteer librarians.

Primary among these would be to better support systematic linking of the dataset into other datasets in the
linked open data cloud. Currently, this is done in an extremely haphazard manner, relying purely on manual
matching (though aided by semantic autocompletion).
A promising avenue would seem to be to hook in an
automated link discovery framework such as Silk [12],
that would be periodically run to systematically discover linkages between the dataset and others in the
linked open data cloud. These could then be farmed
out to the volunteers to be verified, just as is currently
being done with new literary works coming in through
the automated pipeline from BTJ Finland Ltd.
