Abstract. The Thesaurus for the Social Sciences (TheSoz) is a Linked Dataset in SKOS format, which serves as a crucial
instrument for information retrieval based on e.g. document indexing or search term recommendation. Thesauri and similar
controlled vocabularies build a linking bridge for datasets from the Linked Open Data cloud. In this article the conversion process
of the TheSoz to SKOS is described including the analysis of the original dataset and its structure, the mapping to adequate SKOS
classes and properties, and the technical conversion. In order to create a semantically full representation of TheSoz in SKOS,
extensions based on SKOS-XL had to be defined. These allow the modeling of special relations like compound equivalences
and terms with ambiguities. Additionally, mappings to other datasets and the appliance of the TheSoz are presented. Finally,
limitations and modeling issues encountered during the creation process are discussed.

1. Introduction

The Thesaurus for the Social Sciences (TheSoz) is
a SKOS-based German thesaurus for the domain of
the social sciences. It serves as a crucial instrument
for indexing documents and research information as
well as for search term recommendation. The TheSoz
is available in three languages (German, English and
French) and contains overall about 12,000 keywords,
from which 8,000 are so-called descriptors, i.e. preferred terms for indexing documents, and 4,000 non-
descriptors, i.e. non-preferred terms, for which preferred terms are recommended to be used instead.
The thesaurus covers all topics and sub-disciplines of
the social sciences such as sociology, employment re-
search, pedagogics or political science. Additionally

terminology from associated and related disciplines
like economics is included in order to support an accurate and adequate indexing process of interdisci-
plinary, praxis-oriented and multicultural documents.
The thesaurus is owned and maintained by GESIS
- Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences1, an infrastructure organization in Germany, which provides
research-based infrastructure services for the social
sciences. Although TheSoz is specific to the social sci-
ences, most of the terms are used in the colloquial German language, especially in classic media and political
texts.

First attempts [12] for representing the TheSoz in
SKOS (Simple Knowledge Organization System)2 format have been made in 2009 after SKOS has been an-

tions and libraries have begun bringing their thesauri
and vocabularies to the web in SKOS format since
then.

The SKOS version of the TheSoz is based on an intellectually maintained database. It is currently available in version 0.92 via a SPARQL endpoint3 as well
as for download4 in RDF/XML and RDF/Turtle under
a Creative Commons Licence5. Currently, it consists of
421,083 triples. Each URI is HTTP dereferenceable,
which has been enabled by a representation via the
Pubby Linked Data Frontend [9]. This HTML representation is accessible at http://lod.gesis.org/thesoz/. A
user-friendly RDFa-supported interface is planned for
the future.

TheSoz also provides crosslinks to other thesauri:
the STW6, the equivalent German thesaurus for eco-
nomics, the AGROVOC7 thesaurus for the agricultural
domain as well as to DBpedia8. Although the subject
matters of the connected thesauri are similar in some
cases, e.g. between TheSoz and STW, the terms and
concepts used, are quite differently constructed. Links
between thesauri build a relevant bridge for the connection between different Linked Data sources.

In section 2 of this article the conversion process of
the TheSoz to SKOS is presented including the definition of extensions based on SKOS-XL. Furthermore,
the use of established vocabularies and links to other
thesauri are described. In section 3 the appliance of the
TheSoz for information retrieval purposes is presented.
Typical knowledge modeling patterns occurring by the
use of SKOS and SKOS-XL are discussed in section
4. Section 5 concludes and presents an outlook on the
future work regarding the TheSoz.

2. Conversion of the TheSoz to SKOS

The SKOS version of the TheSoz is created from
the original source, which is maintained and stored
in a customized data management system at GESIS.
Content updates for the thesaurus are released regularly every month, followed directly by an update of
the SKOS version. The transformation process of the

thesaurus data into SKOS format has been split up
into three steps and has thereby followed the structured
method introduced in [1], which consists of the following steps: (1) analysis of the structure, the extent
and the complexity of the thesaurus, including contained terms and relations between terms, (2) a mapping of all detected terms and relations to adequate
SKOS classes and properties and (3) the technical conversion of the thesaurus according to the defined map-
ping. This method [1] aims to ensure the quality and
utility of the resulted conversion regarding its interoperability and completeness. All three steps of the
method are applied once on the thesaurus in order to
generate an initial SKOS version. The third step, the
technical conversion and creation of the target output
is conducted regularly, which depends on updates of
the content of the thesaurus.

2.1. Thesaurus Creation

The basis for a transformation of a thesaurus to
SKOS format builds a detailed analysis of the the-
saurus. Therefore, attention has not only been paid to
terms and existing associative and hierarchical relations between them, but also to the general structure
and design issues of the thesaurus, e.g. the existence
of an additional classification system or how far the
thesaurus conforms to established ISO norms9. Relationships between the 8,000 TheSoz descriptors are expressed as broader, narrower or related terms. There
are also "use instead" and "use combination" relations
and their counterparts ("used for" and "used for combi-
nation") between descriptors and non-descriptors. Additionally a classification hierarchy is provided and
each thesaurus term is assigned to one or more classification notations.

For most of the thesaurus terms and relations adequate SKOS properties and classes can easily be identified because of a broad compatibility of the TheSoz
to the standard norms for thesauri. Problems have been
observed, when mapping special data items and rela-
tions, which are not compliant to thesauri standards
like the AD (alternative non-descriptor) terms of the
TheSoz. An alternative non-descriptor is used for indicating ambiguities. Therefore, terms of this type describe generic and ambiguous terms, which have different meanings in specialized sub-contexts. This is
expressed through the use of multiple "use instead"

Description
Descriptors of the TheSoz, which are defined as subclasses of "skos:Concept".
Notation of the classification hierarchy of the TheSoz, which is defined as a subclass
of "skos:Concept".
An equivalence relationship between two terms, where the terms are assigned via "the-
soz:use" and "thesoz:usedFor" properties. This is a subclass of "skosxl:Label".
A compound equivalence between terms. For constructing "use combination" and
"used for combination" relations between terms. The non-preferred term is assigned
by the "thesoz:compoundNonPreferrdTerm" property, the preferred terms by the "the-
soz:preferredTermComponent" property. This is a subclass of "skosxl:Label".
Use relation, which is defined as a subproperty of "skosxl:labelRelation".
Used for relation, which is defined as a subproperty of "skosxl:labelRelation".
A preferred term as a component for a "use combination" and "used for combination"
relation. This property is defined as a subproperty of "skosxl:labelRelation".
The non-preferred term as a component for a "use combination" and "used for combi-
nation" relation. This property is defined as a subproperty of "skosxl:labelRelation".
Relation from a term to the class "thesoz:EquivalenceRelationship".
Relation from a term to the class "thesoz: CompoundEquivalence".
Relation between different languages of a term, which is defined as a subproperty of

and/or "use combination" relations for one single term
at the same time. There are about 200 of such AD
terms in the TheSoz.

For example, the term "committee", which is classified as an AD term, holds "use" relations to the preferred terms "working group", "parliamentary commit-
tee", "Wirtschaftsausschuss" and "advisory panel" at
the same time. Additionally, it contains a "use com-
bination" relation to the combined use of the terms
"product" and "quality". In this case, it means that the
term "committee" is in its semantics such general and
ambiguous, that it is recommended to use a more precise term to describe the intended semantics.

But, because SKOS is based on RDF it is possible to define own relations without greater effort.
Therefore, a precise mapping to SKOS has been more
complex than initially thought [12], where only simple relations of the TheSoz have been modeled in
SKOS. In order to obey the concept-based structure of
SKOS, but without losing relevant relations between
preferred and non-preferred terms, classes and properties of SKOS-XL (SKOS eXtension for Labels)10 have
been used. SKOS-XL has also been used for the representation of the EUROVOC11 thesaurus [10]. Properties of SKOS-XL have been developed explicitly for

the representation of lexical issues and provide the
possibility to model relations between lexical terms inside one SKOS concept. Because of the interconnection of terms in the TheSoz descriptors are represented
as "skos:Concept", but each of the terms is additionally modeled separately as "skosxl:Label". The property "skosxl:labelRelation" allows the definition of extensions such as typical equivalence relationships like
"use" or compound equivalence relationships like "use
combination". Table 1 provides an overview on the
personal classes and properties defined for the TheSoz.
Thus, the term "university ranking" gets the property
"thesoz:compoundNonPreferredTerm" from a class
of the type "thesoz:CompoundEquivalence". The two
other preferred terms ("university" and "ranking"),
which should be used instead, are assigned by the
property "thesoz:preferredTermComponent" from the
same class. This construct indicates that both preferred
terms have to be used together instead of the other term
(see Figure 1).

This modeling approach allows a consistent representation of the alternative non-descriptors of the
TheSoz. Thus, the AD term "committee" and its relationships to other terms can be modeled as depicted in Figure 2. It is assigned by multiple "the-
soz:usedFor" properties from different classes of the
type "thesoz:EquivalenceRelationship", each of which
also holds "thesoz:use" properties to the preferred

room for the publication of further datasets as Linked
Data. The namespace of the personal classes and properties is defined at http://lod.gesis.org/thesoz/ext/ and
is shortened by the prefix "thesoz".

2.2. Usage of existing Vocabularies

Beside the SKOS standard, additional established
metadata vocabularies are used to represent the The-
Soz. For citation, licensing and provenance purposes
properties of Dublin Core, OWL, Creative Commons
and the Provenance Vocabulary12 have been used. Detailed Information on links to other datasets is represented using the VoiD vocabulary13. This dataset description is available at http://lod.gesis.org/thesoz/void.ttl.
The SKOS-XL extensions of TheSoz are defined in
detail using RDF Schema. This ensures further processing and interoperability with other datasets on the
web.

2.3. Links to other Datasets

Currently, the SKOS version of the TheSoz holds
links to the STW Thesaurus for Economics of the
ZBW and the AGROVOC thesaurus of FAO as well as
to DBpedia. Such links are important for the use of the
thesaurus as a terminology hub during information re-
trieval, e.g. for search and query expansion. The SKOS
mapping properties provide standard relations in order
to represent links of SKOS concepts between different
concept schemes, i.e. between different datasets. Table

terms "working group", "parliamentary committee",
"Wirtschaftsausschuss" and "advisory panel". Ad-
ditionally, the "thesoz:compoundNonPreferredTerm"
property is assigned by a class of the type "the-
soz:CompoundEquivalence", which models the "use
combination" relation for the combined use of the
terms "product" and "quality". Without SKOS-XL
based extensions, the ambiguities of the term would be
lost.

According to the Linked Data principles, all con-
cepts, terms and classification notations get their own
URI, which provides a persistent and unique identification of each elements. This is a very important aspect for re-using and linking TheSoz terms
on the web. All URIs are listed in the context path
http://lod.gesis.org/thesoz/, which serves as base URI.
The URI has been chosen according to naming conventions of web addresses of GESIS and in order to leave

These links have been established differently. While
the links to STW have been made manually during
a major mapping initiative [4] and have been converted to SKOS via XSL transformation afterwards
[5], the links to AGROVOC and DBpedia have been
detected by semi-automatic approaches, which results
have been evaluated by domain experts afterwards.
The links to AGROVOC have been identified by a
distance measure approach using the Levenshtein distance with a threshold of 0.21 [6]. The links to DBpedia have been detected using a standard string similarity algorithm. Figure 3 depicts links from the term
"quality assurance" to STW, AGROVOC and DBpedia.

3. Usage of the TheSoz

TheSoz is the main tool for indexing research literature in the German speaking social sciences and
is applied among other disciplinary information systems in the databases SOLIS (Social Science Literature Information System), SOFIS (Social Science Research Information System), SSOAR (Social Science
Open Access Repository) all owned and maintained by
GESIS. The thesaurus is used for document retrieval
in the information portal sowiport14, which is visited
by about 11,000 unique users per month. This portal uses TheSoz as a terminology hub for search and
query expansion, which enables the retrieval of more
than 7,000,000 research documents on a semantically
very precise level. Other databases of sowiport (e.g.
CSA Sociological Abstracts, PAIS International) are
indexed with other thesauri than TheSoz. To overcome
this heterogeneity links between terms of these thesauri are used to support a meaningful keyword search.
The links are used automatically to expand the search
terms for the retrieval inside the other non-TheSoz-
indexed databases. In [3] the effect of using these mappings for intra- and interdisciplinary search questions

has been evaluated in a controlled scenario. The expansion with "exact match"-mappings shows a very positive effect in terms of retrieval precision and recall.

TheSoz and its links to other thesauri are also used
for the construction and provision of specialized search
term recommendation functionalities, which are outlined and evaluated in [2]. In this case the best recommender has been a system, which starts with recommending TheSoz descriptors and leading to further highly-associated TheSoz descriptors, which have
been listed on the basis of a pre-computed co-word
analysis.

4. Modeling Issues

During the modeling process, several obstacles with
the use of SKOS have been observed. Even if a thesaurus meets established ISO norms for thesauri, a
conversion to SKOS is not always as trivial as expected
[1,7,10]: Relations of the original thesaurus cannot always be modeled adequately in SKOS. For TheSoz
especially the representation of compound relationships and compound concepts has been an obstacle.
This has also been required by [1,10], because compound concepts are part of the ISO 2788 standard. Critical modeling issues are discussed in an overview on
correspondences between the ISO norms 2788/5964
and SKOS15 inside the SKOS Primer. For syntactical
compositions of terms like compound equivalences,
it is suggested to define personal extensions either of
"skos:Concept" or "skosxl:Label". For the SKOS version of TheSoz subclasses of both and subproperties of
"skosxl:labelRelation" have been defined. [10] applied
these relations in a similar way for the EUROVOC the-
saurus. [7] has defined a personal construct called "zb-
wext:useInsteadNote" as a subproperty of "skos:note",
which holds information about a "use instead" relation.
When modeling mappings between thesauri in SKOS
format, inconsistencies and problems can occur which
are caused by idiosyncrasies in thesauri. A reason for

14http://www.gesis.org/sowiport/en/

15http://www.w3.org/TR/skos-primer/#seccorrespondencesISO

defined on term-based thesauri before their conversion
to SKOS. Such links cannot always be modeled directly with the SKOS mapping properties. It has to be
investigated, if the two terms of a given mapping represent adequate concepts in the corresponding SKOS
versions by e.g. being used as "skos:prefLabel" in a
concept. Mappings between non-preferred terms cannot directly be modeled in SKOS, because the mapping properties of SKOS can only be applied between
concepts. Although ISO 5964 allows relations between
non-preferred terms, it is only possible defining and
using SKOS-XL extensions.

Domain-specific differences in thesauri can cause
conversion problems either. A concept in one thesaurus
might correspond to a combination of two concepts in
another thesaurus, e.g. the term "Electronic Govern-
ment" of the TheSoz has originally been mapped to
the combination of the terms "Public Administration"
and "Internet" of the STW. The mapping properties of
SKOS do not allow such single-to-multiple relations
(neither for one language nor for multiple languages).
Transforming existing vocabularies and thesauri to
SKOS remains a complex process according to the heterogeneous structure of the involved vocabularies. If
semantically more complex relations are required, i.e.
"use combination" relations between terms of the same
or different vocabularies, personal extensions still have
to be defined in order to preserve the relevant infor-
mation. But, such extensions can lead to incompatibilities to other SKOS datasets or with applications for
processing data in SKOS format, e.g. SKOS thesaurus
management tools. Therefore extensions should be described using standard classes and properties, e.g. with
RDF Schema, so that there is a chance, that such data
is processible at least in a minimal way.

5. Conclusion and Future Work

In this paper, the Linked Dataset TheSoz, a widely
used thesaurus in the domain of the social sciences, has
been presented. It has been brought to SKOS format
by the use of SKOS-XL extensions. This has been necessary because of specific and complex relations of the
original thesaurus like compound equivalences.

It is planned to add more links to datasets like
EUROVOC, the Integrated Authority File (GND)16

dataset of the German National Library and more. For
some of these tasks it is considered to use link discovery tools like Silk [11] or Amalgame [8].

TheSoz and other linked vocabularies play a vital role for connecting heterogeneous GESIS datasets
like the literature collections of sowiport or the GESIS
Data Catalogue17, which comprises study descriptions
of survey data, with each other and with other Linked
Datasets from the web. By using Linked Data we
aim to provide an integrated view on documents and
datasets relevant for social science research.

TheSoz participates as test dataset in the Library
Track at the upcoming OAEI 201218 together with the
STW thesaurus. The existing links between both thesauri serve as reference alignments.
