Abstract. We describe the datos.bne.es library dataset. The dataset makes available the authority and bibliography catalogue
from the Biblioteca Nacional de Espana (BNE, National Library of Spain) as Linked Data. The catalogue contains around 7
million authority and bibliographic records. The records in MARC 21 format were transformed to RDF and modelled using IFLA
(International Federation of Library Associations) ontologies and other well-established vocabularies such as RDA (Resource
Description and Access) or the Dublin Core Metadata Element Set. A tool named MARiMbA automatized the RDF generation
process and the data linkage to DBpedia and other library linked data resources such as VIAF (Virtual International Authority
File) or GND (Gemeinsame Normdatei, the authority dataset from the German National Library).

Keywords: Library Linked Data, Cultural Heritage Linked Data, Linked Open Data, Bibliographic Data, Authority Data, FRBR,

1. Introduction

In recent years, the amount of semantically structured knowledge available on the Web as part of the
so-called Linked Open Data (LOD) cloud has seen a
substantial growth in the domain of cultural heritage
and, particularly, in digital libraries. Indeed, libraries,
museums and archives are showing great interest in
publishing their data as Linked Data (LD) [9]. Several national libraries for example started to publish
metadata as Linked Data, including the Swedish National Library [8], the German National Library1, the
National Library of France2 and the British Library3.
Initiatives like Europeana LOD [7] or VIAF4 (the Virtual International Authority File) also stress the oppor-

tunities offered by Linked Data within the cultural heritage domain. Moreover, the Linked Data value proposition is already producing changes at organizational
levels within library organizations as exemplified by
the Stanford Linked Data Manifesto5, the development
of a new Linked Data-based bibliographic framework
by the Library of Congress, or the official support to
open data from the Conference of European National
Libraries (CENL).

The benefits of publishing library data as Linked
Data have been recently summarized [2] by the W3C
Incubator Group on Library Linked Data. In particu-
lar, the following key benefits of Library Linked Data
(LLD) have been identified: i) provides enhanced and
more sophisticated navigation through information, ii)
increases the visibility of cultural data, iii) supports
integration of cultural information and digital objects
into research documents and bibliographies, iv) offers

a more durable and robust semantic model than metadata formats that rely on specific data structures, v) facilitates re-use across cultural heritage datasets, thus
enriching the description of materials with information
coming from outside the organizations local domain
of expertise, and vi) allows developers and vendors to
avoid being tied to library-specific data formats such as
MARC6 (MAchine Readable Cataloguing) or Z39.507.
In this context, at the end of 2011, the National Library of Spain (Biblioteca Nacional de Espana, BNE)
has transformed into RDF and linked the Authority
and Bibliography catalogues that contain around 7 million authority and bibliographic records. BNE authorities and publications are directly linked to resources
in other datasets: VIAF, DBpedia, SUDOC, LIBRIS,
and the GND (the authority file from the German National Library). datos.bne.es contains approximately
58 million triples generated from MARC 21 records
and 587,000 links to other resources in different languages (e.g., German, French, English, Swedish). The
following sections provide a description of key features of the datos.bne.es dataset, and a guide for potential data consumers.

2. datos.bne.es

datos.bne.es is the main result from the project
Linked Data at the BNE, supported by Biblioteca Nacional de Espana in cooperation with the Ontology Engineering Group (OEG) at the Universidad Politecnica
de Madrid (UPM). There is a strong commitment from
the BNE to maintain and to periodically update and
improve the RDF dataset. This commitment is in line
with the shift towards open web standards and licenses.
datos.bne.es is licensed under the CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication license. The following
sections present the main characteristics of the RDF
dataset.

2.1. Source data

The last version of the RDF dataset is the result of

transforming:
 Authority records8: These records contain metadata describing people, organizations, work titles, and
subject headings.

 Bibliographic records9: These records form a representative subset of the BNE catalogue, and provide metadata belonging to modern and ancient mono-
graphs, electronic records, manuscripts, periodical
publications, maps, engravings, photographs, printed
music, sound and audiovisual recordings.

More information about
the characteristics of the
source data, as well as links to the BNE catalogue, can
be found in the datos.bne.es portal.

2.2. Modelling

IFLA (International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions) ontologies, widely agreed upon
by the library community, have been used to represent the resources in RDF. datos.bne.es is one of the
first international initiatives to thoroughly embrace the
ontologies developed by IFLA [10], namely FRBR
(Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records)
[4], FRAD (Functional Requirements for Authority
Data) [3], FRSAD (Functional Requirements for Subject Authority Data) [5], and ISBD (International Standard for Bibliographic Description) [6]. The first version of the datos.bne.es dataset focused on standard
and widely used vocabularies.

Throughout this paper we will use compact URIs for
identifying vocabulary elements (e.g., frbr:C1001),
prefixes can be resolved to namespaces using the
prefix.cc service10.

Work, (4) Expression, and (5) Manifestation. Also, the
class Thema from the FRSAD ontology has been used
to model the subject authority data. Table 1 present

2.3. Extraction and mapping process

The transformation process from the MARC 21 format to RDF has been carried out using MARiMbA16, a

tool developed to support the mapping process, allowing librarians to use a combination of RDFS and OWL
vocabularies of their choice to model the data. The tool
performs a pre-processing step that generates a set of
spreadsheets, based on the source records. This spreadsheets function as mapping templates where the librarians can manually map the different MARC 21 metadata elements to appropriate RDFS and OWL classes
and properties.

MARiMbA exploits MARC 21 record structure,
namely field codes (e.g., 100, 245), subfield codes
(e.g., $a, $t), and heading information fields17. Although the meaning of these codes is defined by the
MARC 21 standard, not all codes are always used and
their usage may vary across different libraries. Taking
this into account, one of the design principles behind
the approach followed by MARiMbA is to derive the
mappings from the actual data (i.e. by pre-processing
the source records). After pre-processing the source
data, the librarians are presented with the current metadata elements used across the source records so they
can manually assign the correspondences to RDFS and
OWL classes and properties.

The pre-processing step generates three spread-
sheets: (1) Classification mapping: where the user is
presented with all possible combinations of heading
field and subfields (e.g., 100 $a$t), used for assign-

ing an RDF type or OWL class (e.g., frbr:Work) to
each MARC record in the transformation process; (2)
Annotation mapping: where the user is presented with
all possible combinations of field and subfield (e.g.,
100 $t) for each type of entity (e.g., Work), used for
mapping each MARC element to an specific property
(e.g., frbr:titleOfWork); and (3) Relation map-
ping: where the user is presented with all possible variations of subfields (e.g., 100 $a + $t) in the heading field for each pair of entities (e.g., Person-Work,
Work-Work). This mapping is used for creating a relationship between a pair of records of a certain type
given that the string of the heading field of one record
contains the string of the heading field of the other and
that they present a certain variation of subfields.

Figure 2 shows an example of the mapping pro-
cess. Given two records with the following heading
fields: (1) 100 $a Cervantes Saavedra, Miguel de,
and (2) 100 $a Cervantes Saavedra, Miguel de $t
Don Quijote de la Mancha. First, the records are
mapped to frbr:Person and frbr:Work respec-
tively, based on the classification mapping. Second,
field $a is mapped to frbr:nameOfPerson, and the
field $t to frbr:titleOfWork, based on the annotation mapping. Finally, both resources are related
through frbr:isCreatorOf after a string comparison and the analysis of their variation of subfields (100
$a + $t), based on the relation mapping. In addition,
the website found at http://bne.linkeddata.es/
mapping-marc21/ has been set up to provide more
details about the mapping and transformation pro-
cesses, as well as the complete set of mappings used in
the transformation of the RDF dataset.

2.4. Connectivity

In order to analyse the internal structure and connectivity of the instances of the dataset, Table 2 presents
the number of relationships established. From Table 1
it can be observed that there is a high number of mani-
festations, works, persons, and expressions, which correspond to the core entities of FRBR and in general
to the main entities of the bibliographic world. Conse-
quently, among the most established relationships are
those that connect these core entities, namely is creator
of (between a person and a work), is realized through
(between a work and an expression), and is embodied
in (between an expression and a manifestation). The
total number of relationships established between instances within the dataset is 9,394,711, while the total number of instances is 7,418,635. From these data
it can be stated that: (1) although a high number of
relationships has been established, this version of the
dataset only covers primary relationships from FRBR,
(2) the dataset provides a high number of inverse relationships (e.g., is creator of, is created by) which can
facilitate traversing the graphs in several directions. In
Section 3 a concrete example of the internal structure
and connectivity of the dataset will be discussed.

Regarding the external connectivity (i.e. the links
to external datasets), datos.bne.es linksets can be divided into two groups: (1) equivalence links using the
owl:sameAs object property (in descending order):
VIAF (454,068), GND18 (76,413), DBpedia (36,431),
Libris (10,884), and SUDOC19 (9,725), the total number of owl:sameAs links is 587,521, and (2) links to
Lexvo dataset20 using the dcterms:language prop-
erty. It is worth mentioning that VIAF already has links
to widely-used authority files and a number of links
to DBpedia. Therefore, in this version of the dataset
we focused on reusing this authoritative and valuable resource. More specifically, given that (1) VIAF
links are available online21 as a plain text file, and (2)
most libraries have published their authority files using natural keys22 to build the URIs of their RDF re-
sources, MARiMbA provides the functionality to generate equivalence links by parsing the aforementioned

VIAF links and prepending the namespaces to the different keys found in the VIAF links file.

For example, we know that GND URIs follow the
pattern gnd:{GND-ID} and BNE URIs the pattern
bne:{BNE-ID}. Using these two URI patterns we
can establish links between both datasets by creating
owl:sameAs statements using GND-ID and BNE-ID
pairs found in the VIAF links file. In this way, the
GND-ID 11851993X found in the same VIAF cluster
as the BNE-ID XX1718747 can be used to create the
following statement about Miguel de Cervantes:

@prefix bne: <http://datos.bne.es/resource/> .
@prefix dnb: <http://d-nb.info/gnd/> .

bne:XX1718747 owl:sameAs gnd:11851993X

Finally, from the analysis of external

links can
be concluded that: (1) there is a high number of
owl:sameAs links to external library datasets, but
these links cover only authority entities directly mapped
from VIAF links, namely persons, corporate bodies,
works and expressions, (2) for a future version of the
dataset, links at the level of bibliographic entities (i.e.,
manifestations) would improve the connectivity of the
dataset, (3) a high number of links to the Lexvo language resources has been established providing rich
information about such language resources.

2.5. General features

Table 3 provides a summary of the main features and

statistics, according to the VoID vocabulary [1].

3. Miguel de Cervantes Graph Analysis

This section shows a brief example of the data that
can be found within datos.bne.es dataset. More specifi-
cally, it discusses some of the characteristics of a representative graph, a portion of the data related to Miguel
de Cervantes Saavedra, which can help to understand
and illustrate the dataset internal structure. Moreover,
this experiment can help potential consumers to understand the main entities and the relationships between
them. Using datos.bne.es SPARQL endpoint, we build
a graph by issuing the following SPARQL query:

prefix bne: <http://datos.bne.es/resource/>
CONSTRUCT {

bne:XX1718747 ?r ?y .
?y ?r2 ?y2 . ?y2 ?r3 ?y3

} WHERE {

This query builds a graph around the RDF resource
Miguel de Cervantes23. Each node of the graph corresponds to one RDF resource, and each edge corresponds to a relationship between two resources. More
specifically: (1) the graph describes the works created
by Miguel de Cervantes, (2) the different expressions
of each work (e.g., the English version of Don Quijote
de la Mancha), (3) the different manifestations of each
expression (e.g., a publication from 1898 of the English expression of Don Quijote de la Mancha), and (4)
the relationships between these resources (e.g., Cervantes is the creator of Don Quijote).
