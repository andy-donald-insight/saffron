Abstract. The EUscreen project represents the European television archives and acts as a domain aggregator for Europeana,
Europes digital library. The main motivation for its creation was to provide unified access to a representative collection of
television programs, secondary sources and articles, and in this way to allow students, scholars and the general public to study
the history of television in its wider context. In this paper, we present the methodology followed for publishing the EUscreen
dataset as Linked Open Data.

1. Introduction

Massive digitization and aggregation activities all
over Europe and the world have shaped the forefront of
digital evolution in the Cultural Heritage domain during the past few years. Following the increasing support at the European level, as well as the emerging involvement of major IT companies, there has been a variety of, rather converging, actions towards multimodal
and multimedia cultural content generation from all
possible sources (i.e. galleries, libraries, archives, mu-
seums, audiovisual archives etc.). The creation and
evolution of Europeana1 as a unique point of access to
European Cultural Heritage, has been one of the major
achievements of these efforts, while a recent trend in

the area is the publication of cultural datasets as Linked
Open Data2.

Television content is regarded as a vital component
of Europes heritage, collective memory and identity -
all our yesterdays - but it remains difficult to access.
Even more than with the museum and library collec-
tions, the dealing with copyrights, encoding standards,
costs for digitization and storage make the process of
its aggregated and contextualized publishing on the
Web extra challenging.

The EUscreen project 3 aims at the creation of a
representative collection of television programs, secondary sources and articles permitting in this way access to students, scholars and the general public. How-
ever, providing access to large integrated digital collections of cultural heritage objects is a challenging task
involving the resolution of various issues. Firstly, the

aggregation of metadata together with a harmonizing
process - since different content providers adopt different types of models - must be considered. After that,
the metadata must be made available to the public in a
consistent way, not only offering a user friendly navigation and preview but also allowing their consumption and re-use in a machine understandable manner.

In this paper, we present the workflows and respective tools used for the ingestion and manipulation of
Europes Television Heritage content, as well as the
methodology adopted for its publication as Linked
Open Data. Specifically, the overall workflow consists
of three main steps, the metadata ingestion, their transformation to a common reference schema, and finally
their publication as Linked Open Data (see Fig. 1).

Fig. 1. The Overall Architecture

The content providers of EUscreen have been using various collections and content management systems that stored and exported different types of knowledge in a range of metadata models. In order to achieve
semantic interoperability within the aggregation and
with external repositories, a harvesting schema was
implemented based on EBU Core4 [3], which is an established standard in the area of audiovisual metadata.
The MINT aggregation platform5 was used for the
ingestion and transformation of the metadata. MINT
is a suite of web services that facilitate the mapping
and transformation of providers proprietary, legacy
or standardized metadata to a reference representative
model.

Following to the transformation of the contents
metadata, was the establishment of a Linked Open
Data publication procedure. In order to achieve this
objective, the conversion of the harvested metadata to
RDF - using an expressive data model - was required.
In our case, the EBU Core ontology was the most
appropriate to guide this semantic transformation. Fi-
nally, internal and external linking of the EUscreen
content has been performed and the resulting repository was made accessible through a SPARQL end-
point.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The
first section shortly introduces the EUscreen content.
The next two sections present the MINT platform that
was used for the aggregation and transformation of the
metadata, and the procedure followed for their publication as Linked Open Data, respectively. Finally, we
conclude by presenting the significance of the dataset
along with its known shortcomings and by discussing
the future directions and the ongoing work.

2. The EUscreen Content

The EUscreen project aims to create access to over
30,000 items of programme content and information
while its consortium comprises of 20 collection own-
ers, technical enablers, legal experts, educational technologists and media historians of 20 countries.

Every programme is described with explanatory information including the title and the series title in
both the original and the English language, the genre,
the subject, the provider, the dates of production and
broadcast and a summary in English. In addition, technical information such as the aspect ratio, the duration,
the type of sound and the color types for every programme is provided.

In collaboration with leading television historians
EUscreen has defined a content selection policy[6], divided into three strands:

 Historical Topics: 14 important topics in the history of Europe in the 20th Century (70% of con-
tent);

 Comparative Virtual Exhibitions: two specially
devised topics that explore more specialized aspects of European history in a more comparative manner (10% of content - include documents,
stills, articles);

 Content Provider Virtual Exhibitions: Each content provider selects content supported with other

TriplestoreN. Simou et al. / Linked European Television Heritage

digital materials and textual information on subjects or topics of their own choosing (20% of con-
tent).

EUscreen has written a set of guidelines regarding
management of intellectual property rights. The copyright situation of each and every item has been investigated prior to uploading.

3. Metadata Aggregation and Transformation

This section introduces MINT 6, the system that has
been used for the metadata aggregation and transfor-
mation. MINT is an open source, web based platform
for the ingestion, mapping and transformation of metadata records. Interoperability is achieved through the
use of well-defined metadata models - like the EUscreen harvesting schema that was used in this case.

More specifically, the platform offers a user and organization management system that allows the deployment and operation of different aggregation schemes
with corresponding user roles and access rights. Registered users can start by uploading their metadata
records in XML or CSV serialization, using the HTTP,
FTP and OAI-PMH protocols. The most important
step is the implementation of crosswalks for the
providers metadata, for which MINT introduces a visual mapping editor for the XSL language. Mapping is
performed through drag-and-drop and input operations
which are translated to the corresponding code. After
that, users can transform their selected collections to
the desired target schema.

4. EUscreen Linked Open Data Pilot

In this section we present the steps followed for the
publication of the EUscreen content as Linked Open
Data. We start by illustrating the production of the
RDF instances from the aggregated metadata transformed to the EUscreen harvesting schema (XML to
RDF), and we proceed to the way the produced resources are linked to external sources.

4.1. Semantic Representation of the EUscreen

Content

For instantiating the EUscreen data as Linked Data
resources, a machine readable representation in RDF

was necessary. Hence, a decision that was made in accordance to the items described in the homogenized
XML documents, was the selection of the EBU Core
ontology[7] as the vocabulary used for the RDF rep-
resentation. The EBU Core ontology is an RDF representation of the EBU Class Conceptual Data Model
(CCDM). CCDM defines a structured set of audiovisual classes (e.g. groups of resources, media resources,
parts, media objects but also locations, events, persons
and organizations). The EBU Core ontology also defines the semantic relationships (objectProperties) between these classes as well as the properties (dataProp-
erties) characterizing these classes. A lot of the knowledge gathered in the EBU CCDM and EBU Core RDF
was used to develop the W3C Media Annotation ontology7 (W3C MAWG). Reciprocally, EBU Core RDF is
linked to W3C MAWG and has implemented the RDF
modeling options chosen by it, in a subsequent version.
The next step, after the selection of the appropriate vocabularies for the RDF representation of the EUscreen content, was the creation of resources for the
described programmes. In other words, the fulfillment
of the first principle of Linked Data [1] that states the
use of URIs for things. There are various guidelines
for creating cool URIs for the semantic web [2,10]
and the two basic characteristics they must have are
uniqueness for every item, and consistency. According
to these guidelines every entity represented in our data
set leads to the minting of at least three URIs

 a URI for the real-world object itself
 a URI for a related information resource that describes the real-world object and has an HTML
representation (dereferencable)

 a URI for a related information resource that describes the real-world object and has an RDF/XML
representation

To ensure the uniqueness of the URIs, web resources
are served under a domain administered by the project
(lod.euscreen.eu) and the assigned unique identifier of the item is part of the URI. The corresponding
set of URIs for an example of an EUscreen item are
shown below.

N. Simou et al. / Linked European Television Heritage

At this point it must be noted that except for the
URIs that are constructed for the unique things described in the dataset (i.e. the videos) additional URIs
are made for information shared among the dataset.
Such information is the actors, the countries, the sub-
jects, the topics, the organizations and other in the EUscreen dataset. (For example a country can be the location of production of more than one video item.)
Therefore new resources have been created for these
elements values without any identifier - and only by
using their name - since those are already unique.
Hence, in the case of the Netherlands the shared resource constructed is http://lod.euscreen.
eu/resource/Netherlands (note that in Fig. 2
the Netherlands resource is both the coverage of the
video as well as its location i.e. country of production)
After specifying the method for minting present and
future URIs, we proceeded to identify the things described according to appropriate EBU Core classes and
properties that would be used for their representation
in RDF. More specifically, the type of item, as it is defined in the XML schema can be a document, a video,
an audio or a still (i.e. image). Depending on this information the resource created for it can be an instance of
the EBU Core classes Document, TVProgramme, RadioProgramme or Image respectively. The additional
characteristics of the resources are represented in RDF
by using EBU Core properties ranging from typed literals (e.g. original title is represented by ebu:title) to
other internal resources (e.g. video publishers are instances of ebu:Organisation). Furthermore, in the case
of string literals their language is also provided - allowing the consumers of the EUscreen dataset to perform queries for language specific mash-ups - while
whenever required, typed literals are used. Figure 2 illustrates an excerpt of the graph that presents a programmes metadata transformed in RDF8.

Finally, other recommendations that are very important for the publication of Linked Data and have been
considered are the ownership of resources, the licens-

ing and the provenance of information. Therefore, for
every RDF representation of an item provenance metadata is published including the publication date and
the creator. In that way consumers can track the origin
of particular data fragments. Regarding the rights that
apply to the dataset, either one of "Rights Reserved -
Free Access", "Rights Reserved - Paid Access" or "Re-
stricted Access" applies to each item. The selection is
done by the data provider during the metadata mapping
process. The rights are represented in the RDFized version of the metadata by using the "dc:rights" property,
having one of the above values as filler, and also by using the property edm:rights, taken from the Europeana
Data Model [5], together with the corresponding Europeana rights.

4.2. Linking of EUscreen Resources

As already mentioned, Linked Data is simply about
using the Web to create typed links between data from
different sources, therefore after the RDF representation of the EUscreen content, links to other resources
had to be established. There are two distinct linking
cases of interest for the scope of a cultural heritage
aggregation repository like EUScreen. Those among
the internal resources originating from providers data
sources and the ones connecting to external reposito-
ries.

In the case of internal linking, specific elements of
the harvesting schema that relate items have been used.
As such, the value of the harvesting schemas element
"isRelatedToItem" is an EUscreen item identifier. Re-
spectively, in the RDF representation the EBU Core
property "isRelatedTo" was used having as range the
resource of the specific item. Furthermore, additional
internal linking was implemented for the countries, the
actors, the subjects, the topics and the organizations.
As mentioned in the previous section, URIs are created
for those used as the object of a triple. (e.g. the Netherlands resource can be the object of a triple having as
predicate the EBU Core property "hasLocation" and as
subject the TV programme resource see Fig. 2)

The resources implemented for the countries and
languages are also externally linked, since information
on them is served by many data sources. For the creation of external links DBpedia9 has been used. The
names of the local dataset countries and languages are
compared, using SPARQL [9], to the names of the

9http://dbpedia.org

Fig. 2. A graph excerpt of a programme representation in RDF

countries and languages resources served by DBpe-
dia. After the establishment of a link to DBpedia, additional linked data resources are discovered by retrieving the links of each link. In that way the EUscreen repository is linked to more datasets of interest other than DBpedia, like Freebase10, Eurostat11 and
NYTimes12. We have preferred manual linking from a
semi automatic approach like Silk [11] or Limes [8]
because in our dataset we had a small number of distinct countries and languages. This fact allowed for the
application of manual linking and also gave us the ability to examine the validity of the links established to
the external data sources. Therefore, the correctness of
all the links created to external data sources is guaran-
teed. In addition to these links, new external links are
extracted from the video summaries by using DBpedia spotlight 13. In the summary description of a video
quite often names of persons are mentioned that either
participate in the video or the video involves them in
a way. By using spotlight, resources for such cases are
extracted, providing very useful additional information
about the video and therefore improving its search-
ability. Finally, external links were made -whenever
possible- to the providers portals that also serve the
programmes.

4.3. Deployment of the linked open data pilot

So far we have described the main issues regarding the transformation of the harvested and homogenized XML items to RDF and their internal and external linking. However, for fulfilling the 4 main Linked
Data principles [1] we have deployed the EUscreen
linked open data pilot available at http://lod.
euscreen.eu. This pilot was first deployed on the
29th of September 2011 and since then it has been

visited by more than 82414 unique visitors around the
world. Both machine (RDF) and human (HTML) understandable information (the HTML representation of
the items is given through the EUscreen portal15) are
served. More specifically, the aggregated and transformed metadata by MINT are converted to RDF and
published weekly as Linked Open Data. Table 1 illustrates the EUscreen dataset statistics after the publication made on the 13th of January 2013. Finally,
the data are uploaded to fuseki16 - a purpose built
database- in order to provide SPARQL 1.1[4] access
for making their consumption easier. In that way the
data can be consumed through the SPARQL endpoint
17.

5. Conclusion

In this paper, we presented the workflows and respective tools used for the ingestion and manipulation of Europes Television Heritage content as well as
the methodology adopted for its publication as Linked
Open Data. Audiovisual content is very popular in web
users and the main advantage of EUscreen content is
that it is very well annotated and of great significance.
By its publication as Linked Data it can be easily con-
sumed, making in that way, the implementation of various applications that use it much simpler. Such applications may serve educational or historical purposes
since the majority of the content covers historical top-
ics. Moreover, the EUscreen content is enriched by its
linking to external data sources such as the DBpedia,
Eurostat, Freebase and NY Times allowing in that way
for more expressive search and retrieval. For example a consumer can query for videos about actors that
have played the James Bond character by the following
query

PREFIX ebu:<http://www.ebu.ch/metadata
/ontologies/ebucore/ebucore#>
PREFIX db:<http://dbpedia.org/resource/>

The content served by EUscreen can prove to be
valuable data source for linking to many organizations.
The last few years the wed TV has gained great popularity with many channels broadcasting part of or their
whole programme to the web along with metadata. The
very next step for these channels is the publication
of their content as Linked Open Data and the linking
to other data sources of relevant content such as EU-
screen. We must note at this point that a very important contribution of the EUscreen LOD is the creation
of 18.995 resources for persons individuals referring
to the contributors of the programme. Different kinds
of organizations that could link to EUscreen LOD are
cultural institutions like Europeana that has currently
published part of its content as LOD.

At the moment one of the main shortcomings of the
dataset is its size that can be considered small (41.622
items) compared to other cultural datasets like Europeana ( 22 million items). However, having in mind
that the type of content served by EUscreen is European rare television programmes dating back to the
early days of television, we can say that its size is
significant. Furthermore due to EUscreens success a
follow up project has been accepted by the European
Commission, hence the dataset size will be at least
doubled within the next few years.

Current work includes the further improvement of
the MINT services by extending it to offer more advanced normalization and refine functionalities, permitting in that way better results in resource discovery from literals. In addition we intend to further link
the EUscreen dataset to cultural data sources like Europeana and also EBU Core ontology to other media
specific vocabularies.
