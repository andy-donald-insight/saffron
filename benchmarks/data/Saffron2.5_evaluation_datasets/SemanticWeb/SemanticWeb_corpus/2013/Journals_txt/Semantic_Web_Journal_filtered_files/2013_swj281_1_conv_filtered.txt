Abstract. We describe the AEMET meteorological dataset, which makes available some data sources from the Agencia Estatal
de Meteorologia (AEMET, Spanish Meteorological Office) as Linked Data. The data selected for publication are generated every
ten minutes by approximately 250 automatic weather stations deployed across Spain and made available as CSV files in the
AEMET FTP server. These files are retrieved from the server, processed with Python scripts, transformed to RDF according to
an ontology network (which reuses the W3C SSN Ontology), published in a triple store and visualized using Map4RDF.

1. Introduction

Governments and their agencies worldwide are publishing some of their data under open data licenses,
so as to ensure consumption by the general public
and other public and private organisations. In this con-
text, AEMET1, the Spanish Public Weather Service,
announced on November 2010 a major change in its
data policy, offering a gradual, free and public access
to its data in electronic format. As a first step AEMET
offered in their FTP server meteorological data registered by its weather stations, radars, lightning detectors
and ozone soundings. These data were offered with a
free and open license2 as CSV files.

Our work aims at facilitating the use of these data
by processing them and offering them as free and open
Linked Data (LD)3. Following our method for LD generation [13], which we have successfully used in other
domains, we start by processing these data and generating RDF according to a meterology ontology network that extends the W3C Semantic Sensor Network
Ontology (SSN). The aim of this ontology network is
to represent knowledge related to measurements made
by weather stations. These measurements represent the
state of the atmosphere (humidity, pressure, wind, etc.)
in a particular place and time, and is conducted through
the sensors equipped at each weather station. Finally
we publish these data according to LD principles and
visualize it with Map4RDF [6].

The structure of this paper corresponds to the steps
followed to create the dataset. Section 2 describes the
main features of the data selected. Section 3 presents
the design decisions for the URIs, while Section 4 explains the development of our Ontology Network for
Weather Data. Section 5 describes the RDF generation
process. Next, Section 6 presents the exploitation of
the metereological LD. Finally, we present the conclusions and future lines of work.

2. AEMET Data Sources

Among all of the data made available in the FTP
server from AEMET, we have focused on surface meteorological observing stations, and more precisely in
measurements taken in ten minute interval times4. The
data are recorded in several points in the Spanish geography and can be represented as a set of variables
(e.g., temperature or pressure) in a map. These stations belong to the Regional Basic Synoptic Network
(RBSN) in Spain operated by AEMET, in accordance
with the World Meteorological Organization (WMO)5.
The stations are globally identified by a code and have
to accomplish strict quality controls. Their data are
used to feed meteorological models and to draw up
climate studies. AEMET has around 250 automatic
weather stations in this network, registering pressure,
temperature, humidity, precipitation and wind data every 10 minutes. Data from the different stations are
publicly available online in comma-separated-value
(CSV) files, compressed with gzip, updated every hour
and kept for seven days. This means that every hour
six new files are added, corresponding to periods of ten
minutes, and every day a new folder is created to store
the files for that day.

The name of each file follows the naming convention yyyymmddhhmm_datos.csv. This allows processing directly a set of specific files without parsing
(or even downloading) all of them in order to check
whether they are relevant for a specific time range
or not. For example, the file named 201102121900
_datos.csv contains data from the year 2011, the
month of February, on the day 12 at 19:00h. The files
are structured in rows and columns: each row corresponds to a single station, while each column has the
ID of the observation type and the value recorded in
that period of time.

3. URI design for meteorological data

Every resource in our dataset is identified using a
URI6 (Uniform Resource Identifier). URIs have been
designed with simplicity, stability and manageability
principles in mind, following common guidelines for
their effective use7,8,9. Similarly, naming conventions
for ontology concepts and their labels [10,7,2] have a
tantamount importance when linking not only data but
also its explicit model, as an ontology.

This section presents the design decisions and conventions used in the project: (1) base URIs structure
and conventions; (2) URIs and naming conventions of
the AEMET Ontology (TBox), described in section 4;
and (3) URIs of the generated instances (ABox).
Base URI structure. The base URI, common to all
elements in the knowledge base, is http://aemet.
linkeddata.es/. TBox and ABox have been separated into two URI schemes, respectively: http:
//aemet.linkeddata.es/ontology/ and http:
//aemet.linkeddata.es/resource/. In case of
ABox resources, the class name is appended as part
of the URI (e.g. http://aemet.linkeddata.es/
resource/Point/).
TBox URIs. Names assigned to TBox elements follow camel case style, using English names. Class and
property labels have been added in two different languages (Spanish and English). These natural language
descriptions are useful in ontology mapping, information extraction and ontology verbalization.
ABox URIs. Ensuring the uniqueness of the URIs
assigned to distinct real-world objects is important to
mitigate issues such as co-reference [9] and the instance unification problem [4,1]. A series of decisions
have been made for the URIs within the generated
dataset in order to preserve the integrity and semantics
of the data. These decisions followed the recommendations and design patterns proposed by the semantic web community where applicable; in the remaining
cases the team has analysed and discussed the best options and identified certain patterns, as it will be discussed later in this section.

The first decision was to make ABox URIs use Patterned URIs10. This solution mitigates co-reference

problems between two distinct individuals of different
type and same local ID by adding the class name to
the base URI. The second decision was to use Natural
keys11 whenever the source group of resources already
had a unique identifier that could be used (e.g., the
synoptic weather stations and their unique identifier:
INDSINOP). Finally, some other ad-hoc URI structures have been created in order to uniquely identify
the resources. Most of them could be referred to as
a composite pattern, where the local ID is formed
by several interconnected pieces of information related
to the resource being identified (e.g., Observation in
Table 1, which presents the different local IDs assigned
to each type of individual in the ABox).

4. An Ontology Network for Weather Data

The development of the AEMET ontology network
has been performed following an iterative approach
based on the reuse of existing knowledge resources,
both ontological (including ontologies and Ontology
Design Patterns12) and non-ontological, as proposed
by the NeOn methodology [11]. The AEMET ontology
network13 follows a modular structure [11] consisting
of a central ontology that links together a set of ontologies that describe different sub domains involved in the
modelling of meteorological measurements.

Figure 1 presents the main classes and properties of
this ontology network. This model, which can be considered as the AEMET core, contains four modular on-
tologies: Sensor, Time, Location, and Measurement.

The current version of the AEMET ontology network has been implemented in OWL DL and contains
83 classes, 102 object properties, 80 datatype prop-
erties, and has a SROIQ(D) expressiveness. Next, we
present a brief description of each of the sub domains,
as well as the knowledge resources that were reused in
each ontology.

Measurement ontology models the knowledge related to meteorological observations. The main concepts in this ontology are: ssn:Observation,
ssn:FeatureOfInterest and ssn:Property,
reused from the W3C SSN ontology [8]. As part of
the customization of SSN to our use case, the concept ssn:Property has been extended and populated according to the properties that AEMET gathers
in its observations. For this purpose, we have used the
tool NOR2O [12] to transform the non-ontological resource Describe_VAR.csv file provided by AEMET
to an ontological resource.

Location ontology models knowledge about lo-
cations, such as administrative limits and coordi-
nates. The wgs84_pos vocabulary 14 has been reused
with the aim of supporting the representation of geometric positioning by means of the concept Point
and defining a mapping between the relationships
aemet:locatedIn and wgs84_pos:location.
The choice of wgs84_pos is motivated because it is
widely accepted by the community15 to represent simple geo-coordinates. In addition, we reused part of the
GeoBuddies ontology network16 to represent knowledge about the Spanish administrative division.

Time ontology models knowledge about time such
as temporal units, temporal entities, instants, intervals,
etc. This ontology reuses the OWL Time ontology17.
Sensor ontology models the network of sensors and
weather stations. It extends SSN, which supports the
description of the physical and processing structure of
sensors. Here, a sensor is anything that can estimate or
calculate the value of a phenomenon, so as a device, a
computational process or a combination of both. The
sensor representation in the ontology links together
what it measures (the domain phenomena), the physical sensor (the device) and its functions and processing
(the models). During the alignment process between

5. RDF Generation

RDF has been generated with ad-hoc Python scripts18
that are executed in two processing steps, integrating
with ease the generation of RDF and tasks such as
crawling the FTP server that stores the CSV files.

The first step generates the information about the automatic stations, which is static, and thus needs to be
executed only once. Having a script is also more maintainable than manually generating the RDF in case
there are changes, which is usual in an evolutionary
prototype context.

The second step generates the information about the
observations on a regular basis, keeping the data up-
dated. The observations are obtained by crawling the
FTP server from AEMET. When new files are added or
old files are modified, these are downloaded and pro-
cessed. The process is very similar to the one described
in the first step and it can be reused when using plain
text files to generate RDF.

Both steps use templates that model the RDF to be
generated, expressed in N3 notation. These templates
have been generated manually in this agile approach.
For each step two tasks are performed: first the files are
parsed and the relevant information is extracted from

18http://bit.ly/Qo0NX5

them; then, we instantiate the templates and write the
generated RDF to the corresponding files, using the information extracted in the previous task.

The generated RDF is stored in Virtuoso19, which
integrates with Pubby20 to publish the results, making them available for humans and computers. The

Finally, we have used the Silk framework21 to link
the location of the weather stations to other datasets
in LD. In total, 153 links22 were stablished with GeoLinkedData [5], and 82 with DBpedia23.

6. Exploitation

The AEMET dataset exposes the metereological
sensor data in RDF allowing for queries that otherwise
would require a lot of time by just looking at the original files. This section aims to show how the different types of observations can be retrieved and filtered
by submitting SPARQL queries to the endpoint24. To

make the text more readable, we introduce the next
prefix declarations:
ssn: <http://purl.oclc.org/NET/ssnx/ssn#>
aemet: <http://aemet.linkeddata.es/ontology/>
w3ctime: <http://www.w3.org/2006/time#>
geo: <http://www.w3.org/2003/01/geo/wgs84_pos#>

velocity of the wind in m/s (e.g., http://aemet.linked
data.es/resource/WindAmbientProperty/VV10m). Other
possibilities are filtering by the quality of the observation (the numeric "q" value in the query), proximity
to a location (by checking in the query latitudes and
longitudes belonging to the area of interest), etc.

6.1. Retrieving the contents from the observations

6.2. An application for representing and retrieving

Thanks to the modeling proposed in section 4, each
observation can be accessed by any of its attributes.
For example, given the location (latitude and longi-
tude) of a weather station and a date and an hour, we
could retrieve the observations for that exact time with
the following query:
SELECT distinct ?station ?obs ?est ?prop ?value ?q
WHERE {

?station geo:location ?position ;

aemet:stationName ?est .
?position geo:lat <latitude> .
?position geo:long <longitude> .
?obs ssn:observedBy ?station ;

ssn:observedProperty ?prop ;
aemet:valueOfObservedData ?value ;
aemet:observedDataQuality ?q ;
aemet:observedInInterval ?inter .

?inter w3ctime:hasBeginning ?instant .
?instant w3ctime:inXSDDateTime <myDateTime> .

The query also retrieves the name of the weather station measuring the observation, the measured prop-
erty, the value of the measure and the quality of
the value. <latitude> and <longitude> would correspond to the latitude and longitude of the station (e.g.
43.3672222222, -8.41944444444), and <myDate-
Time> would be the date at which we are interested
to recover observations, in xsd:DateTime format (e.g.
2011-05-27 01:40:00).

Additional filters can be added, e.g. if the observations to retrieve from a weather station must be during
a time interval, the final part of the query can be replaced with:
?instant w3ctime:inXSDDateTime ?dt .
FILTER (?dt >= xsd:dateTime("timeIntervalStart")).
FILTER (?dt <= xsd:dateTime("timeIntervalEnd")).
If the objective is to recover a single property of the
weather station, the next SPARQL fragment can be
added to the query:
?obs ssn:observedProperty <desiredProperty> .
Where <desiredProperty> would correspond to the
different properties that describe the sensor measurements in the model. For example, we could choose the

meteorological data

By extending the queries introduced in the previous
section, we have built an application25 for showing the
contents of the AEMET dataset. The application consists on a viewer based on Map4RDF [6], a tool to visualize and access to LD resources.

Each station is represented with a marker in a map.
When a user clicks on one of the markers, a new pop
up window appears showing the last stored measure
and the value of each of its observations (wind, tem-
perature, pressure, etc.). The value of the last measurement is retrieved dynamically from the endpoint, enabling the application to show up an updated value at
the specific point where it was measured. Additionally,
the windows show a menu to display the graphics of
the values for an observation by the specific weather
station.

Another reported use of our dataset is the evaluation of meteorological models and streams of sensor data. As an example, the work described in [3]
builds a self-contained evaluation system which links
raw sensor measurement to high-level semantics using
our dataset.

Finally, other potential uses of the dataset show off
when we combine it with other datasets in LD. For ex-
ample, it can be used with the GeoLinkedData dataset
by exploiting its geospatial information with coordinate comparisons (e.g., measure the wind speed in stations close to airports to analyze its relation to flight
delay, check the temperature close to certain rivers, villages or provinces for biology studies, etc.).

7. Conclusions

In this paper we have presented the AEMET LD
dataset, which exposes public meteorological data
from AEMET resources as LD. We have reused ontologies like the W3C Time ontology and the SSN ontology (widely used in other systems); we have shown
how to retrieve the data, create and update and expose
the triples automatically in our endpoint and show the

25http://aemet.linkeddata.es/browser.html

Atemezing et al. / Transforming Meteorological Data into Linked Data

results in a generic visualizer that considers the geoposition of the data.

Other systems can reason over this data, offer vi-
sualizations, aggregations, use it for evaluations, etc.
Once the data has been extracted and is offered as LD,
applications that use LD can instantly benefit from it.
These data can be linked with data from sectors like
agriculture or tourism to find correlations and study
its impact. Moreover, publishing the dataset as LD
allows modularity and reusability. For example, less
time would be required for the development of applications based on this data (in particular, it would save
time understanding its format and parsing without er-
rors, since it is standardized and there are many tools to
process it) as we have already shown with the visual-
izer. Finally, by complying with well established stan-
dards, interoperability is enhanced (e.g., within other
sensor networks and applications using these ontolo-
gies), and the linking in other domains such as medi-
cal, geographical, biological, etc.

There are two known shortcomings of our dataset.
The first one is the maintenance and discovery of high
quality links to external datasets, which is a daunting task due to the large size and diverstity of such
datasets. In order to tackle this issue, we plan to reexplore the existing datasets in the cloud and try to find
the commonalities with those that expose additional
information of sensors and locations.

The second shortcoming is in the scalability of the
data, due to the triples generated per day. We currently
address scalability issues by keeping only the latest
week in the dataset (following AEMET policy), and
storing the rest of the files as compressed unprocessed
data. As future work, we plan to produce summaries
of older data in a separate endpoint, so as to be able to
store and query a wider range of days efficiently.

As other lines of future work, we plan to publish
additional types of measurements recently exposed by
AEMET (e.g., solar radiation, weather forecasts for the
current day, etc.), which could be very useful when
combined with biology datasets (how species migrate)
or for users planning trips.
