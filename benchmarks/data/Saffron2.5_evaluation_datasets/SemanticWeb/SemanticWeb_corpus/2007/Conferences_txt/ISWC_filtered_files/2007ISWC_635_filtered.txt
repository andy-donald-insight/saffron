Abstract.  For  the development  of  Semantic  Web  technology,  researchers  and 
developers in the Semantic Web community need to focus on the areas in which 
human reasoning is particularly difficult. Two studies in this paper demonstrate 
that  people  are  predisposed  to  use  class-inclusion  labels  for  inductive  judg-
ments.  This  tendency  appears  to  stem  from  a  general  characteristic  of  human 
reasoning  using heuristics to solve problems. The inference engines and interface  designs  that  incorporate  human  reasoning  need  to  integrate  this  general 
characteristic underlying human induction. 

1   Introduction 

In order for the Semantic Web to remain technologically viable, it must either drastically expand human abilities or create totally new experiences in our lives. Many inventions have achieved this: the automobile expanded peoples mobility; TV elevated 
the  scope  of  our  experience;  E-mail  facilitated  the  ability  to  communicate.  Unless 
Semantic Web can change human experience and ability in a fundamental manner, its 
technological innovation will be short-lived. 

How can the Semantic Web change our lives? One goal of the Semantic Web is to 
aide  complex  inferential  tasks  such  as  medical  diagnosis,  business  decisions,  or  investment predictions by making the vast amount of data now available on the World 
Wide  Web  useful  for  the  machine  [1].  However,  to  develop  successful  inference 
agents,  semantic  web  researchers  need  to  know  exactly  what  is  needed  to  supplant 
human inferential behavior  how people make inferential reasoning, when their reasoning becomes irrational and fallible, and how a computer program can help fulfill 
our shortcomings.  

The  question  therefore  boils  down  to  the  following:  are  the  existing  approaches, 
such as RDF, RDFS, OWL, and other inferential agents, sound enough in principle to 
support human reasoning abilities? If not, what is needed for the evolution of the Semantic Web? Study in human cognitive psychology can make an important contribution in this regard. 

In  this  paper,  I  will  describe  two  cognitive  studies  conducted  in  my  laboratory  
and  illustrate  how  people  (college  students)  solve  simple  inferential  questions  
using ontological tags. In so doing, I aim to provide insight into the development of

inferential agents in the Semantic Web environment  from the perspective of human 
cognitive psychology. 

In a nutshell, the present studies show two things: one, that people display a significant tendency to use class-inclusion labels to make inferential judgments, and two, 
that they separate category labels from property labels and make rule-like reason-
ing. This disproportional reliance on categorical class labels appears to stem from two 
sources: (a) human reasoning is intertwined with language, thus linguistic categories, 
such as count nouns and adjectives, influence the way people make inductive reason-
ing; (b) because of processing constraints, people often apply simple heuristics, such 
as  using  class-inclusion  labels,  to  solve  inferential  problems  [2].  The  inference  engines and interface designs that incorporate human reasoning need to take advantage 
of  these  fundamental  characteristics  of  human  reasoning  in  order  to  be  successful. 
Specifically, it may be useful to separate ontological status of class-information (ap-
plicable  for  count  nouns)  and  property  information  (applicable  for  adjectives).  Fur-
thermore,  applications  of  Semantic  Web  technology  should  focus  on  the  areas  in 
which human reasoning is particularly vulnerable.  

2   Study 1 

Consider a simple reasoning experiment, in which subjects are shown schematic pictures  of  cartoon  insects  side  by  side  and  are  asked  to  predict  a  hidden  value  of  an  
attribute of a test insect on the basis of a sample insect (Fig. 1). One selection is consistent with the attribute value shown in the sample insect (e.g., long horns in Fig. 1a). 
The other selection is inconsistent with the feature shown in the sample insect (e.g., 
short horns in Fig. 1a). 

Fig. 1. Two examples of a stimulus frame in the inference task in Studies 1 and 2. In one group 
of trials, both sample and test stimuli had the same labels (monek and monek). In the other 
group of trials, sample and test stimuli had different labels (plaple and monek). Subjects 
were asked to predict the hidden value of body parts in test stimuli on the basis of sample stimuli shown right next to the test stimuli. In this manner, this experiment assessed the extent to 
which the attribute value of one stimulus (sample stimulus) is projected to other stimuli.

Above  each  insect,  an  arbitrary  tag  (monek  or  plaple)  is  placed.  The  main 
question is how the probability of selecting the consistent attribute (selecting the long 
horns in Fig. 1a) would change as the ontological status of the arbitrary tags is modi-
fied.  As subjects rely on the  labels to  make judgments, the probability of  making a 
consistent choice would go up or down sharply depending on whether sample and test 
stimuli have the same tags (Fig. 1a; monek vs. monek) or different tags (Fig. 1b; 
plaple vs. monek). For example, many subjects would select long horns in Fig. 1a 
(consistent choice), but few subjects would choose short horns in Fig. 1b. The question  is  how  peoples  inferential  behavior  would  change  when  these  arbitrary  tags 
carry  different  ontological  information,  class  inclusion  information  or  property  possession information. 

In  four  independent  experiments,  a  group  of  undergraduate  students  received  the 
same  stimuli  and  answered  the  same  inferential  questions  (60  trials  in  total).  How-
ever,  the  instructions  they  received  were  modified  slightly  so  that  these  arbitrary  
labels (monek and plale) represented different ontological information. In a classtag  condition,  the  instructions  characterized  the  two  arbitrary  labels  (monek  and 
plaple) as representing two types that these insects belong to. In a property-tag con-
dition, the instructions characterized the same arbitrary labels as representing shapes 
of wings hidden underneath the insects body. In a pictorial class-tag condition and a 
pictorial property-tag condition, the labels were removed and replaced with pictorial 
symbols (Fig. 2).  

 

 

Fig. 2. Two examples of the stimulus frames used in the pictorial class-tag and pictorial prop-
erty-tag conditions in Study 1. Note that the verbal labels (monek and plaple) in Fig. 1 are 
replaced with pictorial signs in these conditions. 

In this manner, the class-tag condition characterized these labels with class inclusion  information,  and  the  property-tag  condition  characterized  these  labels  with 
property  information.  In  both  pictorial  class-tag  and  pictorial  property-tag  condi-
tions, the two verbal labels (monek and plaple) were replaced with pictorial signs. 
These pictorial signs were described as representing two types of insects (pictorial 
class-tag  condition)  or  different  shapes  of  insects  (pictorial  property-tag  condition). 
Except for these points, all subjects received the same stimuli and answered the same 
inferential questions. 

T. Yamauchi 

The probability of selecting attributes consistent with sample stimuli would go up or 
down drastically depending on whether sample and test stimuli have the same or different labels (Fig. 1 and Fig. 3). However, this shift would depend on the ontological information that these tags represent. For example, when the tags represent names of the 
types that these insects belong to, the probability of selecting attribute values consistent with the sample stimuli (i.e., consistent choice) would go up. On the other hand, 
when the same tags represent a property that these insects have, the probability of consistent choice would go down. In this manner, this study helped identify the extent to 
which different ontological tags (class information vs. property information; verbal labels vs. pictorial signs) would influence the inference of unknown attributes [3].  

 

Fig. 3. A hypothetical response pattern. This response pattern shows a heavy reliance on tags. 
As the sample and test stimuli have the same tags (see Fig. 1a), the proportion of making consistent  choices  is  high.  However,  when  the  sample  and  test  stimuli  have  different  labels,  the 
proportion of  making  consistent  choices  goes  down  sharply.  The  difference  between  the  two 
proportions is defined as a polarity score. 

In Study 1, I present the results from four experiments, and show a clear indication 
that  people  tend  to  rely  on  verbal  labels  representing  class-inclusion  information  to 
make inferential projections. Study 2 further shows that this bias is present even when 
class division does not have proper meaning, suggesting that using class-inclusion 
labels is likely to be a default strategy for human reasoning. 

2.1   Method 

2.1.1   Participants 
A  total  of  175  undergraduate  students  participated  in  this  study  (the  class-tag  
condition,  n=49;  the  pictorial  class-tag  condition,  n=51;  the  property-tag  condition,

plaple. See also Table 1. 

 

n=41;  the  pictorial  property-tag  condition,  n=34).  The  participants  were  recruited 
from the Psychology Subject Pool administered at Texas A&M University.  

2.1.2   Materials 
The stimulus materials were schematic illustrations of cartoon insects produced from 
five sets (A, B, C, D, and E) of prototypes (Fig. 4).  Each stimulus was composed of a 
combination  of  five  feature  dimensions  with  binary  values  (horns=long/short, 
head=round/angular,  torso=dotted/striped,  legs=8  legs/4  legs,  tail=short/long),  along 
with category labels (monek/plaple) (Table 1). The depiction of these features varied  across  the  five  stimulus  sets,  while  they  maintained  abstract  commonalties.  For 
example, the monek prototypes in the five sets all had long horns, round heads, dotted 
torsos, 8 legs and short tails, while the exact appearance of these components was different across the sets. 

Individual trials consisted of pairs of a sample stimulus and a test stimulus (Fig. 1). 
We  created  100  test  stimuli  from  the  five  sets,  A,  B,  C,  D,  and  E  (20  stimuli  from  

T. Yamauchi 

each set  Fig. 4). These test stimuli were produced systematically by exchanging individual components of the two prototypes. All test stimuli had 2 features consistent 
with the prototype of one category and 2 features consistent with the prototype of the 
other  category,  and  1  feature  was  masked  for  an  inference  question  (Table  1).  One 
version of the stimulus materials was produced from prototype sets A, B, and C. The 
other  version  was  produced  from  prototype  sets  A,  D,  and  E  (Fig.  4).  The  sample 
stimuli, which were shown right next to the test stimuli, were the two prototype stimuli of set A.

tent response for that question. For example, given test stimulus M1, the horns dimension was 
queried, and the selection with 1 (long horns) is defined as a consistent response.

2.1.3   Procedure 
For each trial, participants were shown a pair of sample and test stimuli on a computer  screen, and  were  instructed  to  select one  of  two  feature  values  for  the  body 
part in question. Every participant received 30 test stimuli twice (60 trials in total). 
In  one  case,  a  test  stimulus  was  paired  with  the  prototype  of  the  corresponding  
 
?

?
category (i.e., match condition) (Fig. 1a). In the other case, the same test stimulus 
was paired with the prototype of the other category (i.e., mismatch condition) (Fig. 
1b). For example, stimulus M1 in Table 1 was shown twice, once with the sample 
stimulus M0 (this is called a matched trial because M1 and M0 had the same label 
monek)  and  once  with  the  sample  stimulus  P0  (this  is  called  a  mismatched  trial 
because M1 and P0 had different labels, monek and plaple). Each participant received a total of 60 trials (20 test stimuli each from sets A, B, and C or sets A, D, 
and E  Fig. 4). 

Participants  indicated  their  responses  by  clicking  one  of  the  two  designated  but-

tons. The order of presenting stimuli was determined randomly for each participant.  

2.2   Results and Discussion 

Each  condition  was  treated  as  an  independent  study  (no  participants  participated  in 
these experiments more than once). Because these experiments were given in separate 
semesters,  the  four  experiments  were  compared  by  a  meta-analytic  procedure  [4]. 
Specifically, we compared the effect size r of the polarity score (Fig. 3) obtained in 
each experiment with the following equations:

Fig. 5 and Table 2 summarize the major results from Study 1. As Fig. 5 shows, the 
impact of  matched/mismatched labels was considerably larger  when the labels  were 
characterized with class inclusion information (class-tag condition). When sample and 
test  stimuli  had  the  same  tags,  the  proportion  of  making  consistent  responses  was 
high. When sample and test stimuli had different tags, the proportion of making consistent  responses  declined  sharply.  This  tendency  decreased  substantially  when  the 
same labels were characterized with property information. It is also evident that verbal  labels,  but  not  pictorial  signs,  were  more  important  for  inferential  projections. 
When the verbal tags  were replaced  with pictorial signs, the polarity score declined 
substantially.

Overall, the effect size comparing the impact of matched and mismatched tags was 
particularly  large  in  the  class-tag  conditions  as  compared  to  the  other  conditions; 
Zs>2.37, ps<0.01 (Table 2), suggesting a clear inclination to use category labels for 
the prediction of body parts. 

3   Study 2 

Study  1  indicates  a  strong  preference  for  using  class-inclusion  tags  for  inferential  
predictions. It is likely that using these categorical labels is a default strategy for inferential  reasoning,  and  Study  2  tested  this  idea.  In  Study  2,  the  instructions  in  one 
condition  (a  random-class  tag  condition)  explicitly  stated  that  the  two  classes 
(monek and plaple) of these cartoon insects were determined randomly by a coin 
toss, and there was no particular meaning attached to these types. This condition was 
compared  to  other  property-tag  conditions,  in  which  the  same  arbitrary  tags  were 
characterized as representing names of diseases that these insects carry, or names of 
the islands on which these insects live. If using class-inclusion tags is a default reasoning strategy, the polarity score obtained in the random-class tag condition should 
be still larger than those obtained in the other property-tag conditions. 

3.1   Method 

3.1.1   Participants 
A total of 164 undergraduate students participated in the experiment for course credit 
(random-class tag, n=57, property-tag (disease), n=49; property-tag (island), n=58). 

3.1.2   Materials and Procedure 
One version of the stimulus materials was produced from prototype sets A and B. The 
other version was produced from prototype sets A and C (Fig. 4). In total, each participant  received  40  test  trials.  In  the  random-class  tag  condition,  the  instructions 
specified the arbitrary tags representing two types of the insects that were determined 
randomly by a coin toss. In the other property-tag conditions (disease and island), the 
instructions  stated  that  these  tags  represent  names  of  diseases  or  islands  that  these 
imaginary insects carry or live on. Except  for this  single point, the three conditions 
were identical in their procedures, materials, and designs. Individual participants participated in one of the 3 experiments, and no participants participated in the experiment more than once.  

3.2   Results and Discussion 

As in Study 1, each experiment was treated as an independent study (no participants 
participated in these experiments more than once), and these studies were examined 
with  a  meta-analytic  procedure  by  comparing  the  effect  sizes  of  the  polarity  scores 
obtained in each experiment. 

Fig. 6 and Table 3 summarize the major results from Study 2. The most important result in Study 2 is that the polarity score obtained in the random-class tag condition is 
still substantially higher than those obtained in the other property-tag conditions, suggesting that using class-inclusion labels is somewhat automatic for many participants.

As Fig. 6 shows, the impact of matched/mismatched labels was considerably larger 
when  the  labels  were  characterized  with  class  inclusion  information.  When  sample 
and test stimuli had the same tags, the proportion of making consistent responses was 
high. When sample and test stimuli had different tags, the proportion of making consistent  responses  declined  sharply.  This  tendency  decreased  substantially  when  the 
same labels were characterized with property information.  

Overall, the effect size obtained in the random-class tag condition was significantly 
larger than that in the property tag (island) condition; Z=1.70, p<0.05. The effect size 
difference between the random-class tag condition and the property-tag (disease) condition was also substantial; Z=1.61, p=0.053 (Table 3), suggesting a sizable advantage 
for a random-class tag over the two property tags. Taken together, these results confirm that there is a strong tendency to use class-labels to make predictions. 

4   General Discussion 

We manipulated the meanings associated with arbitrary labels attached to imaginary 
insects,  and  examined  how  the  manipulation  would  influence  the  way  the  subjects 
predict  the  attributes  of  these  insects.  In  both  Study  1  and  Study  2,  the  college  
students displayed a strong tendency to use class inclusion labels to make their inferential judgments. This tendency was reduced significantly when the verbal tags were 
replaced with pictorial signs, or when the tags represented various kinds of property 
information, such as the disease, location, or the shape of wings that these imaginary 
insects carry, live, or possess.  

Why does human reasoning heavily rely on verbal labels representing class inclusion  information?  One  source  of  this  bias  seems  to  come  from  the  need  to  maintain 
cognitive economy [5]. One of the most compelling findings in the cognitive psychology of inductive inference is that people make a predictive inference on the basis of the 
categorical  information  that  is  immediately  recognizable [6]-[10].  By  arranging  concepts categorically, we treat individual objects as a group and deal with the characteristics  of  the  group  as  a  whole,  rather  than  individual  objects  separately.  Grouped  
representation  can  expedite  many  cognitive  tasks,  and  help  overcome  the  processing 
limitations of the human brain [11]. As a result, we often gloss over individual differences and draw erroneous conclusions about individuals (e.g., stereotyping).  

Another important source of the over-reliance on class inclusion labels is likely to 
stem  from the  influence of language. Category labels generally correspond to count 
nouns (e.g., animals, dogs, cats, or apples). They are subject to linguistic constraints 
to a larger degree than adjectives, because count nouns vastly outnumber adjectives in 
linguistic communications. This may be an important reason why noun labels are fundamentally different from attribute labels and affect our inductive inference in a significant manner [12]. For example, noun labels can be used as a metaphor (my job is 
a jail), or to help activate a particular aspect of a concept (the pen is mightier than 
the sword). When noun labels are used metaphorically (my job is a jail), the label 
jail does not represent a collection of individual instances of jail. Rather, the label 
accentuates one aspect of the concept (e.g., being captive). In this manner, the meaning associated with noun labels is determined in the context of communication, and 
categorical noun labels can flexibly influence our inferential behavior.

Implications  for  Semantic  Web  research.  What  does  the  current  finding  tell  us  in 
terms of the development of the Semantic Web? There are several important implica-
tions. First, the developers and researchers in the Semantic Web community may be 
better off by focusing on the areas in which human reasoning is particularly vulner-
able. Our strong inclination to use class inclusion labels comes from the need to process  information  quickly  in  light  of  our  processing  constraints.  This  bias  occurs  
particularly when processing information is mentally cumbersome. Unlike computers, 
the  human  brain  is  far  limited  in  its  processing  capacity.  When  reasoning  involves 
many options and conditions to weigh, we rely on simple heuristics, such as the recognizablility and representativeness of a selection.  

The application of the Semantic Web can be especially important in fields such as 
product  selection,  medical  diagnosis,  and  human  resources  management.  For  exam-
ple, in selecting a home insurance policy, we need to process a large amount of regu-
lations, conditions, criteria and so on. Insurance companies often deliberately fill their 
policies with many unrecognizable options, making it difficult for lay people to grasp 
necessary information. Selecting appropriate drugs also require extensive processing 
of the information related to their ingredients, possible side effects, and effectiveness. 
The Semantic Web can help people make rational decisions by helping reduce processing overload. A similar application can be developed in many areas of product se-
lection,  such  as  the  selection  of  infant  foods,  automobiles,  schools,  and  houses. 
Clearly, machines appear to do much better than humans in these areas.  

Another  potentially  promising  area  of  Semantic  Web  application  can  be  medical 
diagnosis. According to recent statistics, 1 in every 47 diabetic patients (5.7 million 
US citizens) were misdiagnosed.1 Misdiagnosis occurs primarily due to the failure to 
take a variety of patient information into account, such as his/her family history, life-
style,  age  and  racial  marker.  With  the  advent  of  genome  research,  individuals  genomic information will also become available to clinicians in the future, and doctors 
will be increasingly fraught  with individuated information. By developing  inference 
agents tailored for specific patents, medical diagnosis can be facilitated significantly 
by using the Semantic Web technology [13] [14].  

Human resources management can be another promising area. Selecting appropriate employees, and providing sound services to individual employees (e.g., health insurance  and  retirement  benefits,  and  employee  training)  requires  a  vast  amount  of  
individuated  information.  This  process  can  be  facilitated  by  utilizing  semantic  web 
agents  that  are  appropriately  geared  to  analyze  the  information  about  individual  
employees.  

Finally, the present study indicates that OWL researchers and developers may need 
to consider vocabularies that are aligned with linguistic classes, such as count nouns, 
adjectives  and  verbs.  Likewise,  algorithms  for  ontology  matching  may  also  need  
to  integrate  these  linguistic  classes.  Many  agents  in  ontology  matching  measure  
the semantic similarity between ontologies by a weighted sum of individuated simi-
larity  factors  [15]  [16]  [17].  These  linguistic  classes  can  be  a  dominant  factor  in  
determining the degree of matching between ontologies. Because human knowledge

is primarily expressed by language, our conceptual activities (e.g., inferential reason-
ing) are also subject to the structure of language [18] [19]. Researchers in the Semantic Web community may need to pay attention to this relationship.
