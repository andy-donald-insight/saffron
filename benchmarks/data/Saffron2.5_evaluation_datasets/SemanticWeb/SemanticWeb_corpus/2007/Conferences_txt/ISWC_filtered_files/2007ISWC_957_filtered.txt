Abstract.  Ontology  mapping  is  to  find  semantic  correspondences  between 
similar  elements  of  different  ontologies.  It  is  critical  to  achieve  semantic 
interoperability in the WWW. This paper proposes a new generic and scalable 
ontology mapping approach based on propagation theory, information retrieval 
technique and artificial intelligence model. The approach utilizes both linguistic 
and  structural  information,  measures  the  similarity  of  different  elements  of 
ontologies  in  a  vector  space  model,  and  deals  with  constraints  using  the 
interactive  activation  network.  The  results  of  pilot  study,  the  PRIOR,  are 
promising and scalable.

1   Introduction 

The  World  Wide  Web  (WWW)  now  is  widely  used  as  a  universal  medium  for 
information exchange. Semantic interoperability among different information systems 
in the WWW is limited due to information heterogeneity, and the non semantic nature 
of HTML and URLs. Ontologies have been suggested as a way to solve the problem 
of  information  heterogeneity  by  providing  formal  and  explicit  definitions  of  data.  
They  may  also  allow  for  reasoning  over  related  concepts.  Given  that  no  universal 
ontology  exists 
finding  semantic 
correspondences  between  similar  elements  of  different  ontologies,  i.e.,  ontology 
mapping. Automatic ontology mapping is important to various practical applications 
such  as  the  emerging  Semantic  Web  [3],  information  transformation  and  data 
integration [2], query processing across disparate sources [7], and many others [4].

focused  on 

Ontology  mapping can be done either by hand or using automated tools. Manual 
mapping  becomes  impractical  as  the  size  and  complexity  of  ontologies  increases. 
Fully  or  semi-automated  mapping  approaches  have  been  examined  by  several 
research studies, e.g., analyzing linguistic information of elements in ontologies [15], 
treating  ontologies  as  structural  graphs  [12],  applying  heuristic  rules  to  look  for 
specific  mapping  patterns  [8]  and  machine 
techniques  [1].  More 
comprehensive surveys of ontology mapping approaches can be found in [9][14].

2   The Proposed Approach 

2.1   Profile Enrichment 

Similar  as  the  virtual  document  used  in  Falcon-AO  system  [15],  the  profile  of  a 
concept is a combination of linguistic information of a concept, i.e. the profile of a 
concept  =  its  name  +  label  +  comment  +  property  restriction  +  other  descriptive 
information.  The  Profile  Enrichment  is  a  process  that  uses  a  profile  to  represent  a 
concept in the ontology, and thus enrich its information. It is based on the observation 
that sometimes the information carried in the name of a concept is restricted, but other 
descriptive  information  like  labels  and  comments  may  contain  words  that  better 
convey  the  meaning  of  concepts.  A  sample  profile  of  a  concept  book  looks  like 
Profile(book)= (book, book, book, monograph, collection, write, text). Afterwards the 
tfidf  (term  frequencyinverse  document  frequency)  weight  will  be  used  to  assign 
larger  weight to the terms that have a  high  frequency in  given document and a low 
frequency  in  the  whole  collection  of  documents.  Here  each  profile  is  treated  as  a 
document and all profiles in two ontologies are treated as the collection of documents.  

2.2   Profile Propagation 

The Profile Propagation exploits the neighboring information of each concept. That is, 
the profile of ancestors and descendants are passed to that of the concept itself based 
on  propagation  theory  [6].  The  process  of  profile  propagation  can  be  represented 
using Equation 1, where C and C denote two concepts in the ontologies, S denotes 
the set of all concepts in the ontologies, VCnew denotes the new profile vector of the 
concept C, VC denotes the profile vector of the concept C, and w(C, C) is a function 
that  assigns  different  weights  to  the  neighbors  of  the  concept  following  two 
principles:  1.  The  closer  two  concepts  locate,  the  higher  impact  they  have.  2.  The 
impact from ancestors to descendants is higher than the impact from descendants to 
ancestors.

Ontology Mapping: An Information Retrieval and Interactive Activation Network 

2.3   IR-Based Profile Mapper 

The  insight  of  the  proposed  approach  is  to  treat  ontology  mapping  problem  as  an 
information retrieval task. That is, if concepts in an ontology are seen as documents in 
a  collection,  finding  correspondence  between  similar  concepts  in  ontologies  is  just 
like  to  search  the  most  relevant  document  in  one  collection  given  a  document  in 
another  collection.  Given  a  query  and  a  set  of  documents,  classical  IR  methods 
usually measure the similarity of a query and different documents, and then return the 
documents with top-ranked similarities as result. In the context of ontology mapping, 
such IR method can be applied as following: Given two to-be-mapped ontologies, OA 
and OB, all profiles of concepts in OA are indexed first. Simultaneously queries based 
on the profile of each concept in OB are generated. Then searches are executed in OA 
using queries generated from OB one by one. Afterwards the concepts in OA with topranked similarities or above a predefined threshold are returned and stored. Now two 
ontologies are switched and the whole process is repeated. Finally two result sets are 
compared and the overlapped ones indicate possible mappings. 

Cosine angle between two vectors of the documents is commonly used to measure 
their similarity. In the context of ontology mapping, the cosine similarity between two 
concepts  C  and  C  can  be  measured  using  Equation  2,  where  VC  and  VC  are  two 
vectors  of  the  profile  of  concept  C  and  C  respectively,  n  is  the  dimension  of  the 
C are ith element in the profile vector of concept C and C 
profile vectors, Vi
respectively, |VC| and |VC| are the lengths of the two vectors respectively. The output 
of  Profile  Mapper  is  a  concept-to-concept  similarity  matrix,  where  each  element 
represents a similarity between two concepts. Note that such a similarity matrix might 
be very sparse due to the large size of ontologies and the low overlap between them.

2.4   Interactive Activation Network Based Constraints Satisfaction Solver 

to 

the  characteristics  of  ontology 

Constraints satisfaction problem (CSP) [16] arises as an intriguing research problem 
in  ontology  mapping  due 
its 
representations. The hierarchical relations in RDFS, the axioms in OWL and the rules 
in SWRL result in different kinds of constraints. For example, "if concept A matches 
concept B, then the ancestor of A can not match the child of B in the taxonomy" and 
"two  classes  match  if  they  have  owl:sameAs  or  owl:equvalentClass  relations".  To 
improve the quality of ontology mapping, it is critical to find the best configuration 
that can satisfy such constraints as much as possible.  

itself  and 

CSPs  are  typically  solved  by  a  form  of  search,  e.g.  backtracking,  constraint 
propagation, and local search [16]. The interactive activation network is first proposed 
to solve CSPs in [13]. The network usually consists of a number of competitive nodes 
connected to each other. Each node represents a hypothesis. The connection between 
two  nodes  represents  constraint  between  their  hypotheses.  Each  connection  is 
associated  with  a  weight.  For  example,  we  have  two  hypotheses,  HA  and  HB.  If 
whenever HA is true, HB is usually true, then there is a positive connection from node

A to node B. Oppositely if HA provides evidence against HB, then there is a negative 
connection from node A to node B. The importance of the constraint is proportional to 
the strength (i.e. weight) of the connection representing that constraint. The state of a 
node is determined locally by the nodes adjacent to it and the weights connecting to it. 
The  state  of  the  network  is  the  collection  of  states  of  all  nodes.  Entirely  local 
computation can lead the network to converge to a global optimal state. 

In  the  context  of  ontology  mapping,  a  node  in  an  interactive  activation  network 
represents a hypothesis that concept C1i in ontology O1 can be mapped to concept C2j 
in  ontology  O2.  The  initial  activation  of  the  node  is  the  similarity  of  (C1i,  C2j).  The 
activation  of  the  node  can  be  updated  using  the  following  simple  rule,  where  ai 
denotes the activation of node i, written as ni, neti denotes the net input of the node.

The  neti  comes  from  three  sources,  i.e.  its  neighbors,  its  bias,  and  its  external 
inputs, as defined in Equation 4, where wij denotes the connection weight between ni 
and nj, aj denotes the activation of node nj, biasi denotes the bias of ni, the istr and estr 
are constants that allow the relative contributions of  the  input from internal  sources 
and external sources to be readily manipulated. Note that the connection matrix is not 
symmetric and the nodes may not connect to themselves, i.e., wij=wji, wii=0.

Furthermore, the connections between  nodes in the  network represent constraints 
between  hypotheses.  For  example,  the  constraint  that  only  1-to-1  mapping  is 
allowed  results  in  a  negative  connection  between  nodes  (C1i,  C2j)  and  (C1i,  C2k), 
where  k=j.  Moreover,  two  concepts  match  if  all  their  children  match,  results  in  a 
positive connection between nodes (C1i, C2j) and (C1k, C2t), where C1k and C2t are the 
children of C1i and C2j respectively. Finally, the complexity of the connections may be 
very large because of complex constraints. 

3   Pilot Study 

The  proposed  approach  has  been  partially  implemented  in  the  PRIOR  [10][11],  an 
ontology  mapping  tool  based  on  propagation  theory  and  information  retrieval 
techniques.  The  results  from  OAEI  ontology  matching  campaign  2006 1 show  the 
PRIOR  is  promising  and  competitive  to  all  other  approaches  in  different  tracks, 
namely benchmark, web directory, food, and anatomy [5].  

4   Future Work 

The  implementation  of  the  interactive  activation  network  to  satisfy  constraints  in 
ontology mapping is our major future work. Other work includes integrating auxiliary 
information such as WordNet to distinguish synonyms.
