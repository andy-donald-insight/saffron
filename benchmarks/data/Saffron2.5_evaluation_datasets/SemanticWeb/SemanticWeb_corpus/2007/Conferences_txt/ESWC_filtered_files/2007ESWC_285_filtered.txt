Abstract. Computer manipulated social networks are usually built from the explicit assertion by users that they have some relation with other users or by the
implicit evidence of such relations (e.g., co-authoring). However, since the goal
of social network analysis is to help users to take advantage of these networks, it
would be convenient to take more information into account. We introduce a threelayered model which involves the network between people (social network), the
network between the ontologies they use (ontology network) and a network between concepts occurring in these ontologies. We explain how relationships in
one network can be extracted from relationships in another one based on analysis techniques relying on this network specificity. For instance, similarity in the
ontology network can be extracted from a similarity measure on the concept net-
work. We illustrate the use of these tools for the emergence of consensus ontologies in the context of semantic peer-to-peer systems.

1 Introduction

Social networks, i.e., networks based on the relation between people is our common
environment. Many have realized that social networks are a key facilitator for collab-
orating. Social scientists have been analyzing the effectiveness of of these networks
by helping characterizing the key individuals that must be touched in order to achieve
some goals [1]. Recently, on the semantic web, social networks are very often described
through FOAF or FOAF-like schemata. They could as well be built upon shared address
books.

However, when communities are really different or when people do not want to describe explicitly their relationships, social networks have to be inferred from secondary
sources. These secondary sources are often documents: bibliometrics has for long made
a speciality of inferring social networks and many other clues from databases of coauthoring and citations. The web is a rich source of documents that can be used as
secondary sources for inferring social networks from analyzing the hyperlinked structure on the web [2] (along the way used by google for inferring most authoritative
web pages) to exploiting the more intimate personal infospheres made of web pages,
weblogs, and so on.

Most of these sources are based on explicit links that still need from document authors (or web page designers) to know each others. In this paper, we investigate the dual
principles of:

 using the knowledge structure used by individuals in order to infer some of their

social relationships, and

 taking advantage of this inferred social structure in order to help people sharing

their knowledge.

For that purpose, we introduce a structure made of three superposed networks that

are assumed to be strongly linked:

Social network relating people on the basis of common interest;
Ontology network relating ontologies on the basis of explicit import relationships or

implicit similarity;

Concept network relating concepts on the basis of explicit ontological relationships

or implicit similarity.

We call this stack of interlinked networks a semantic social network.

The top-down links between these networks are obvious: people use ontologies that
defines or refer to concepts. The less obvious aspect that is illustrated here is bottomup inference of relationships from one network to another. These relationships can be
inferred by analyzing the structure of knowledge.

Once the structure of knowledge allows to infer intellectual relationships between
people, it is possible to use it for helping people managing their knowledge. For in-
stance, finding that similar people use similar ontologies or the same ontology makes
them candidates to be standardized. In addition, when starting some collaboration between partners in order to merge their knowledge or to define one common ontology, it
is better to start from the ontology used by considering social features such as centrality
and authority.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Sect. 2 provides a description of a
target application which uses network analysis in order to help people sharing ontology
annotated resources. Sect. 3 provides the basic knowledge in social network analysis. As
the main contribution, Sect. 4 and 5 explain the three-layered semantic social network
structure. Sect. 4 considers each layer, the kind of relationships it expresses and the tools
that can be used for manipulating these networks. Sect. 5 investigates the relationships
between these layers and the opportunity this provides to lift network structure from
one layer to another. Sect. 6 presents an experiment we have conducted. Finally, in
Section 7, this work is compared with previous studies related to social networks on
semantic web.

2 Emerging Collaboration in Peer to Peer Networks

We apply semantic social networks in the context of peer-to-peer (P2P) sharing of annotations in which individuals can use ontologies for annotating resources (in our case,
photographs). Because, these individuals can have different needs and different stand-
points, they are not constrained to use the same ontology (contrary to BibSter [5], for
?

?

?
instance). They can take advantage of standard ontologies on the web (like FOAF or
EXIF), but they can extend these ontologies to their needs.

However, when people want to query other peers, for benefiting from better annotation or from other pictures, the network of heterogeneous ontologies must be dealt
with. This ontology mismatch is solved by offering an alignment infrastructure to the
peers that allows them to find some alignments between their ontologies and to process
queries through mediators [6].

Current work on ontology matching consists of either automatically matching two
ontologies without regard to its context or environment, or of interactively helping some
knowledge engineer to match two ontologies. Our goal is to take into account the social
networking context in order to improve the alignment results and, in turn, the social
networking expertise.

In this context, semantic social network analysis has two purposes:

 helping people to find other peers with similar interests, and
 helping peers to find the best company for starting designing consensus ontologies.

For the first purpose, there are two options. On the one hand, the peers can use social
network analysis (SNA) to find in their explicit personal network of peers with some the
same interests. Such people would certainly use ontologies that are not totally remote
and trying to match these ontologies promise to be easier and more rewarding. On the
other hand, if one peer has no relation with known peers sharing the same interest, but
is looking for some pictures, it will be more convenient that he looks for peers having
similar ontologies. The peers can use metrics on the ontology network in order to find
ontologies which are close to theirs. The underlying assumption is that these peers will
have similar interest to theirs even if they are not explicitly recorded as connected.
Moreover, if the metric is compatible with some matching algorithm, the matching will
be easier to perform. So, in this situation, the social network is used for satisfying
the need of some user (finding interesting annotated resources) and this action will
contribute strengthening the social network by exhibiting new links between peers. As
a simple example, Fig. 1 illustrates the potential connection between unknown users by
ontology alignment in a semantic social network.

Another contribution of SNA to this application is to identify the central (authori-
tative) ontologies at the ontology level such that aligning with these ontologies allows
to be connected with the maximum number of peers (and thus retrieve the maximum
number of answers).

Matching algorithms can take advantage of SNA in order to help find the closest
ontologies with regards to the connectivity of users and to identify which users are
more prone to the use of a pivotal ontology.

Beside matching ontologies in an ad-hoc manner, there is time when peers can
imagine benefiting from putting their experience together and building some consensus ontologies. To that extent, they can also use SNA in order to identify the community (cohesive subgroups on the social level), the best peer for proposing consensus
(centrality on the social network), or the ontologies which could be the seed for this
collaboration process (centrality on the ontology layer). Of course, when both coincide
(i.e., when the central individuals use a central ontology), the chances of success are
higher.

3 Network Analysis

Network analysis is based on the analysis of the relationships within a population. We
here consider networks with several different relations between individuals. So, a network is characterized as a set of objects (or nodes) and a set of relations.
Definition 1 (Network). A network N, E1, . . . En is made of a set N of nodes and
n sets of object pairs Ei  N  N the set of relations between these nodes.

We will below freely use the relations as functions (Ei(n) = {n
  N|n, n
in the graph of Ei is a sequence of edges
As usual, a path p between node e and e

the shortest paths between them, when it exists. By convention, spd(e, e) = 0. Thus,
spd(Arun, Sebastien) in Fig. 1 is three via Jason and JeromeE.

and the shortest path distance spdi(e, e
?

?
Social network analysis [1] has considered various measures on the networks be-

tween people (note that these measures apply only if the network is connected)1:
Closeness. The inverse of average length of the shortest path between a node e and any

other node in the network:

Closenessi(e) =

|N  1|

Hub and authority. There are different but interrelated patterns of power: Authorities
that are referred to by many and hubs that refers to many. The highest authorities
are those which are referred to by the highest hubs and the highest hubs that those
which refers to the highest authorities. Kleinberg [2] proposes an iterative algorithm
to measure authority and hub degree of each node in interlinked environment. Given
initial authority and hub degrees of 1, the degrees are iteratively computed by

Similarly to betweenness, the hub weight indicates the structural position of the
corresponding user. It is a measure of the influence that people have over the spread
of information through the network.

Our purpose being the identification of individual that are prone to collaborate with
each others, we would like to find these clusters of individuals in the network. There
are no standard method for extracting so-called cohesive subgroups in social network
analysis. Many different methods are proposed based on graph-theoretic terms (e.g.,
cliques [1]) or clustering methods (e.g., [8]).
Definition 2 (Distance network). A distance network N , E1, . . . , En is made of a
set N of nodes and n sets of distance functions Ei : N  N  [0 1] defining the distance between nodes (so satisfying symmetry, positiveness, minimality, and triangular
inequality).

Distance values can also be seen a weights or costs. It is clear that any network is a
distance network which attributes either 0 or 1 as a distance. The definitions of SNA
mentioned above can be adapted to distance networks if each time the cardinality of a
set of edges if used, it is replaced by the sum of its distances. The distance of a path is
obtained by summing the distances of its edges. One extension that must be made is to
use the distance between nodes to reduce their influence to others in the computation of
authority and hub degrees:

4 Three-Layered Architecture for Semantic Social Networks

In order to uncover the links between people from those that can be found from their
knowledge, we propose the three-layered architecture for constructing the semantic social network. As shown in Figure 1, it consists of i) a social network (S), ii) an ontology
network (O), and iii) a concept network (C). The characteristics of each layer and the
relationships between layers are described below.

J.J. Jung and J. Euzenat

4.1 Social Layer
In the social layer (S), nodes are representing people, and relations are the connections
, where NS is
between peoples. A social network S is a directed graph NS, Eknows
 NS  NS the set of relations between these persons. In
a set of person and Eknows
most current applications, the relation used by SNA is the knows relation that can be
found in FOAF.

From the social network in Fig. 1, the authoritative and hub weights of three users
are shown in Table 1. Obviously, the highest hub weight is assigned to Jason because
he is an important and unavoidable role of bridging between the rest of users.

4.2 Ontology Layer
The ontology network O is a network NO, Ei
Ei

kinds of relations at this stage:

, in which NO is a set of ontologies and
 NO  NO the relationships between these ontologies. There can be two main

import when some ontology explicitly import another ontology;
refer when some ontology uses some concept defined in another ontology.
The objective relationship from the S to the O is through the explicit usage of an ontology by a user which can be expressed by a relation: U se  NS  NO.

We can easily interpret the hubs as being the ontologies that combine a large number of other ontologies. These would be an interesting starting point for any newcomer
willing to annotate a similar set of objects as his friend. Likewise, authorities will be ontologies that are extended and imported by many different actors (i.e., de facto standard
ontologies).

There is a difference between ontology networks and social networks though: while
in social networks it is normal to be connected to several authorities, an ontology will
only import one ontology on some topic. It would thus be useful to recognize those
hubs that connects authorities on the same topics, these ontologies are likely to be the
expression of an alignment between the two authorities.

4.3 Concept Layer
In the concept layer (C), nodes are concepts, and links are the numerous kinds of links
, in
that can be found in ontologies. The concept network C is a network NC , Ei


which NC is a set of entity of an ontology (classes, properties, individuals) and Ei
?

?

?
NC  NC the relationships between these entities. These relationships are far more
numerous than in the other layers and depends on the kind of entity considered. If we
restrict our attention to classes, the:

1) linking a class to its super classes;

subClass linking a class to its subclasses;
superClass (=subClass
sibbling linking a class to its siblings;
disjoint linking a class to the classes it is explicitly disjoint with;
1) linking a class to its properties;
property (=domain
range1 linking a class to the properties that refer to it.
The objective relationship from the O to the C is through the definition of concept in an
ontology which can be expressed by a relation: Def ines  NO  NC. However, this
notion of definition is not easy to catch: it could be based on either the assertion of a
constraint on some ontology entity or the namespace in which entity belongs. We will
consider the namespace in the following.
We are here further away from social networking. As noted in [4], the notions of hub
and authority cannot be understood in the same way for all the relations expressed in C.

5 Inferring Relationships

This three-level semantic social network does not bring in itself new improvement for
our P2P sharing application. In order to provide new insight in the possible collaborations it is necessary to analyze these networks and to propagate information from one
layer to another. We explain how, starting from the lower concept layer, it is possible to
enrich the upper ontology and social layers with new relations from which SNA helps
finding relevant peers.

5.1 Similarity on the Concept Layer

Beside the numerous relationships that can be found by construction of the concept
layer, new relationships can be inferred between the entities. One particular relationship that will be interesting here is similarity. In order, to find relationship between
concepts from different ontologies, identifying the entities denoting the same concept
is a very important feature. As a matter of fact, most of the matching algorithms use
some similarity measure or distance in order to match entities.

Similarity on the concept layer can be obtained by various means [9]. Some distances
can be established from the local features of entities. For instance, the name of entities
can be the basis for matching them. Many techniques have been developed for comparing strings, based on their structures (like edit distance), their morphology (through
lemmatization), their entry in lexicons (using WordNet). Another kind of similarity can
be established based on set of shared instances like in [3].

Some other distances, more in the spirit of network analysis, can be defined from the
structure of the network. For instance, [10], defines possible similarities (e.g., SimC,
SimR, SimA) between classes, relationships, attributes, and instances. Given a pair of

J.J. Jung and J. Euzenat

classes from two different ontologies, the similarity measure SimC is assigned in [0, 1].
The similarity (SimC) between c and c
?

?

?
is defined as
?

?

?
(5)

SimC(c, c

) =
?

?

?
EN (C)

E M SimY (E(c), E(c
C

))
?

?

?
where N (C)  {E1 . . . En} is the set of all relationships in which classes participate
(for instance, subclass, instances, or attributes). The weights C
E are normalized (i.e.,

EN (C) C
If we consider class labels (L) and three relationships in N (C), which are superclass

E = 1).

(Esup), subclass (Esub) and sibling class (Esib), Equ. 5 is rewritten as:

SimC(c, c

?

?
) = C
+ C

+ C

L simL(L(Ai), LF (Bj))

))
supM SimC(Esup(c), Esup(c

subM SimC(Esub(c), Esub(c
))

))
sibM SimC(Esib(c), Esib(c

(6)

where the set function M SimC computes the similarity of two entity collections.

As a matter of fact, a distance between two set of classes can be established by

finding a maximal matching maximizing the summed similarity between the classes:

M SimC(S, S

max
?

?

?
) =
?

?

?
c,cP airing(S,S) SimC(c, c

max (|S|,|S|)
?

?

?
)

(7)

in which P airing provides a matching of the two set of classes. The OLA algorithm
is an iterative algorithm that compute this similarity [10]. This measure is normalized
because, if SimC is normalized, the divisor is always greater or equal to the dividend.
A normalized similarity measure can be turned into a distance measure by taking its
C (x, y) = 1  SimC(x, y)). Such a distance introduces a new
C in the concept network C. This relation indeed defines a distance network

complement to 1 (Edist
relation Edist
as introduced above.

5.2 From Concept Similarity to Ontology Similarity

Once such a distance has been introduced at the concept level, it can be used for computing a new distance at the ontology level. Again, a distance between two ontologies can be established by finding a maximal matching maximizing similarity between
the elements of this ontology and computing a global measure which can be further
normalized:

Definition 3 (Ontology distance). Given a set of ontologies NO, a set of entities NC
: NC  NC  [0 1] and a relation Def ines :
provided with a distance function Edist
NO  NC, the distance function Edist

O : NO  NO  [0 1] is defined as:
C (c, c
c,cP airing(Def ines(o),Def ines(o )) Edist
max(|Def ines(o)|,|Def ines(o)|)

))
?

?

?
O (o, o

Edist

) =
?

?

?
max(
?

?

?
O (o, o) = 0.

Towards Semantic Social Networks

This is the measure that is used in the OLA algorithm for deciding which alignment
is available between two ontologies [10]. However, other distances can be used such as
the well known single, average and multiple linkage distances.

This ontology distance introduces a new relation on the ontology layer. This measure
provides a good idea of the distances between ontologies. These distances, in turn,
provide hints of the difficulty to find an alignment between ontologies. It can be used
for choosing to match the closest ontologies with regard to this distance. This can help
a newcomer in a community to choose the best contact point: the one with who ease of
understanding will be maximized. This will be further developed in Section 5.4.

5.3 From Concept Similarity to Alignment

It can however happen that people have similar but different ontologies. In order for
them to exchange their annotations, they use alignments existing within the ontology
network. Alignments, in turn, are the results of applying matching algorithms based on
the correspondence between ontologies.

As a result, from concept similarity these algorithms will define a new relation

Ealign at the ontology level.
Definition 4 (Alignment relation). Given a set of ontologies NO, a set of entities NC
: NC  NC, a matching algorithm M atch based on
provided with a relation Edist
and a relation Def ines : NO  NC, the alignment relation Ealign is defined as:
Edist

o, o

  Ealign iff M atch(o, o
?

?

?
) = 

If one has a measure of the difficulty to use an alignment or of its quality, this network can also be turned into a distance network on which all these measures can be
performed.

This new relation in the ontology layer allows the agents to choose the ontology
that they will align with first. Indeed, the ontologies with maximal hub centrality and
closeness are those for which the benefit to align to will be the highest because they
are aligned with more ontologies at the ontology level. In the P2P sharing application,
choosing such an ontology will bring the maximum answers to queries. For example,
in the concept layer of Fig. 1, two alignments between i) poArun and poJason and ii)
poSebastien and poJason enable Arun and Sebastien to share information, even though
they are not explicitly linked with each other.

This is the occasion to note the difference between the relations in the same network:
in the ontology network, the hub ontologies for the import relation are rather complete
ontologies that cover many aspects of the domains, while hub ontologies for the Ealign
relation are those which will offer access to more answers.

Of course, when an alignment exists between all the ontologies used by two peers,
there is at least some chance that they can talk to each others. This can be further used
in the social network.

5.4 From Ontology Similarity to People Affinity

Once these measure on ontologies are obtained, this distance can be further used on the
social layer. As we proposed it is possible to think that people using the same ontologies

J.J. Jung and J. Euzenat

should be close to each other. We can consider measuring the affinity between people
from the similarity between the ontology they use.
Definition 5 (Affinity). Given a set of people NS, a set of ontologies NO provided with
O : NO  NO  [0 1] and a relation U ses : NS  NO, the affinity is
a distance Edist
the similarity measure defined as
?

?

?
o,oP airing(Use(p),Use(p )) 1  Edist
?

?

?
)
O (o, o

Eaf f (p, p
?

?

?
) =

max

max(|U se(p)|,|U se(p)|)

(8)

Since this measure is normalized, it can be again converted to a distance measure
through complementation to 1.

Introducing the distance corresponding to affinity in the social network allows to
compute the affinity relationships between people with regard to their knowledge struc-
ture. Bottom-up inference from C allows to find out the semantic relationships between
users based on this space.

For completing the P2P application, the last step consists of identifying the sub-

groups of users, according to the various social characteristics, as follows:
1. The subgroup whose members are assigned very high semantic authoritative weight
(or semantic hub weight) can be identified by comparing the weights computed with
Equ. 4. These peers have the social power to control and select semantic information to distribute.
computing the cohesive subgroup of the S network using affinity (Eaf f ).

2. The subgroups of people with very similar personal ontologies can be obtained by

3. The subgroup of people which are interested in the same topics extends the previous
subgroups, depending on a particular topic. Their members can efficiently share
information about that topic.

6 Experimental Results

As a first evaluation of our framework, we want to differentiate social affinity Eaf f
) from the previous measures for social features. Our experimentation scenario
(p, p
follows these steps (i) building personal ontologies during photo annotation, (ii) aligning these personal ontologies for measuring social affinity between people, and (iii)
discovering the most powerful person for semantic interoperability.

For collecting data, we invited seven members of our team to select a set of photographs and annotate them by using a specific annotation tool (Picster2). Table 2 shows
the specification of personal ontologies.

From co-occurrence patterns between the annotated photos, Mikas social centrality

CM [3] can be formulated by

CM (Ui) =

where |U| is the total number of people in the social network. The results are shown in
Table 3. We found out that the number of annotated resources are barely related to the

social centrality. SL annotated the least number of resources, so that his centrality also
lowest among people. But, even though JEs annotations were the largest one, JP has
shown the most powerful centrality.

We measured semantic affinity on the semantic social network (Eq. 8). For doing so,
the ontology distances Edist
O between personal ontologies are measured. We used string
edit distance between class labels. For instance, Edist
O between JE and AZ is shown in
Table 4. Then, we can measure Eaf f (AZ, JE) = max(o,o 1Edist
6 =
0.82 where ontology distance between non aligned ontologies (-) are regarded as 1.
We computed this for all pairs of people on the social network, as shown in Table 3. The
matrix for social affinity is symmetric. We found out that the number of ontologies are
playing an important role in social affinity. JE has shown the highest centrality in the
given social network, while JP annotated the most common resource with other peo-
ple. This means that collaborations can be effectively be provided with JE. Meanwhile,
Eaf f (JJ, JP) was relatively high (0.72). We found that they were using the same large
ontology (i.e., SUMO). So the number of found correspondences where very high. To
deal with this problem, we have to consider preprocessing personal ontologies.

Another issue is the discovery of potential collaborators (or like-minded people) by
comparing the social distances in Table 1. While the social distance between AS and
SL is 3 on the social layer of Figure 1 (i.e., 1. once normalized), their social affinity is
measured as 0.62 which is relatively high (the corresponding distance would be .38).
We can expect that they can share common interests.

7 Related Work

Many semantic systems on distributed environments like P2P networks have been introduced to efficiently share information and knowledge between heterogeneous sources.
Some have studied the relevance of peers (or users) by analyzing topology and interactions like message passing. In [11], for selecting the expert peers, semantic topology
analysis is exploited. But they make assumptions that every peers have to use the same
ontology for calculating semantic similarity. Practically, [12] applies the similar idea to
multi-agent architecture, and as an example of application, Jung has introduced a social
communication framework for collaborative web browsing [13]. Meanwhile, Alani and
colleagues introduced a system, called Ontocopi, for ontology-based network analysis
(ONA) [14]. This system can identify the communities by using informal data.

More closely related to this work, Mika proposes a three-layered space which is composed of a social network and a knowledge network relying on concepts and instances
[15]. However, the knowledge network is simply based on sets for co-occurrence analy-
sis, and in this networks, the super/sub-relationships are retrieved based on statistical
overlapping. This approach does not deeply consider semantic relationships between
concepts and ontologies, so it is hard to use the structure of knowledge for structuring
the social network.

For measuring the relevance of ontologies, in [4], the AKTiveRank system ranks
the ontologies applying a number of classical metrics such as class match, central-
ity, density, and semantic similarity. In [16], network analysis methods (in particular,
Hermitian matrices-based eigensystem analysis) are used for analyzing ontologies as
concept graphs in the same way social network are analyzed. This is used for contrasting the style of ontologies but not for social networking, though this last application
could be investigated.

8 Concluding Remarks and Future Work

We have focused on using the structure of knowledge used by people in order to extract
meaningful relations at the social level. Moreover, the extraction of these new relations
is used to further improve the collaborative sharing and exploitation of this knowledge.
We propose a three-layered architecture for constructing semantic social network,
which is composed of a social layer, an ontology layer, and a concept layer. This space
not only supports the relations within a layer, but also the propagation of relations between layers. We have provided the principles for extracting similarity between concepts and propagating this similarity to a distance and an alignment relation between
ontologies. This distance relation can be used for discovering affinity in the social net-
work. In return, users can take advantage of these newly established relations to find

people closer to them on the basis of the structure of their knowledge. For that purpose,
we have only used classical SNA measures (that we extended to distance networks).

The basic assumption of this work is that these newly discovered relations between
people will facilitate mutual understanding as well as ontology matching and resource
sharing. This remains to be demonstrated experimentally. To that extent we are developing and experimenting the presented P2P sharing system. We will make measure and
generate alignment and ask users to rate and correct the provided alignments.

There remains important issues to be investigated: all these networks are not equal
and their exploitation with classical SNA tools can be meaningless (in the same sense
that considering the loves and hates relations as the same would lead to problems).
It is thus important to characterize the various relations that were provided with regard to the measures that can be used on them. We also plan to extend this work by
defining and extracting meaningful (and useful) clusters among people. We expect to
apply this information to build social and semantic grid environment [17]. Moreover,
the cost of computing these networks can become important. We have not considered
this issue here because most of the given measures are examples, but this can become
an important factor if the networks and measures have to be computed on-line.
