Abstract. OGOLOD is a Linked Open Data dataset derived from different biomedical resources by an automated pipeline, using
a tailored ontology as a scaffold. The key contribution of OGOLOD is that it links, in new RDF triples, genetic human diseases
and orthologous genes, paving the way for a more efficient translational biomedical research exploiting the Linked Open Data
cloud.

1. Introduction

OGOLOD is a Linked Open Data (LOD) dataset
that represents combined information about orthologous genes and human genetic diseases (Table 1). Orthologous genes present similarity due to the fact that
they descend from a common ancestor [4]. Such genes
can be used to extrapolate information from one organism to another; hence the interest of using them to infer new hypotheses about human genetic diseases, that
is, understanding the genetic causes of diseases [1,6].
The growing interest for facilitating an efficient access
to information about orthologous genes is also demonstrated by efforts like Quest for Orthologs [4].

OGOLOD is the output of an automated pipeline
that obtains and adapts information from the following
sources:

 Databases of orthologous genes: COG [15], Inparanoid [11], Homologene1, and OrthoMCL [3].
 OMIM2 (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man),
a database holding information about human genetic diseases.

The information from these sources is collected as
RDF instances using the OGO ontology (Figure 1).
Thus, the OGO ontology provides the backbone in
which to embed all the data collected from the sources:
an axiomatised representation of the knowledge do-

main of orthologous genes and human genetic dis-
eases. The OGO ontology combines widely used vocabularies from the life sciences domain, in doing so
enhancing the capability of the OGOLOD dataset of
being integrated with the rest of the (life sciences)
LOD cloud. Such reused vocabularies describe different domains of interest: GO (gene product function,
location, or process) [5], ECO3 (evidence code types
that support the link of a gene product with a GO
term), NCBI taxonomy (classification of organisms)
[13], RO (a set of widely used biological relations)
[14], and HPO (a vocabulary for human phenotypic
abnormalities) [12]. OGOLOD has also links to other
LOD datasets, providing a unique entry point to combine information about orthologous genes with other
extant LOD datasets.

OGOLOD allows researchers to combine, in their
research hypotheses, information about the evolutionary relationship of genes, their biological implications
and their relation with disorders. For instance, researchers of genetic disorders could find genes in other
species with similar function to the ones associated
with such disorders. As a consequence of such integration of information, OGOLOD gives the researchers
the ability to answer queries like diseases in which
the orthologous genes of gene X are involved (Fig-
ure 3), or all orthologous genes that belong to Rattus Norvegicus and are related to the genes involved in
lung cancer (Figure 4).

OGOLOD is the LOD version of the OGO Knowledge Base (KB) [8,9] (OGOLOD stands for OGO
Linked Open Data). OGOLOD has been produced by
following the methodological guidelines described in
[16] for publishing LOD datasets, committing to an
iterative and incremental life cycle model. The process of converting OGO to OGOLOD and the resulting OGOLOD dataset are detailed in [10]; this paper
focuses on the OGOLOD dataset alone, providing a
self-contained and brief overview.

2. Discussion

2.1. URI design

The URI design in OGOLOD is based on slash
URIs, instead of hash URIs, since the dataset has a
considerable size. Also, the URIs reflect the structure

of outbound links, the owl:sameAs relationships were established
manually, by adding a relation when the original database ID was
the same in both datasets.

of the model, making a distinction between classes and
instances, to improve the usability of the dataset.4

2.2. Reification of n-ary relations to avoid blank

nodes

Blank nodes, i.e., resources without a URI, should
be avoided when publishing LOD information [7],
which poses a problem when N-ary relations must
be represented in the published dataset:
the most
straightforward way of representing N-ary relations
is by using blank nodes.5 This is the case for the
OGOLOD dataset, since the relation between a gene
and its GO term (location, function, or process) is
qualified with an evidence code (e.g., a gene participates in a concrete process, and such relation is
backed by an experimental confirmation). This problem was solved in OGOLOD by merging the OWL ob-

inf.um.es/ogolod/ontology/Gene, and the URI for the

ject properties with the evidence codes, i.e., expanding the properties according to the evidence codes:
a subproperty of participates_in was generated for every evidence code, e.g., participates_EXP_in for Inferred from experiment,
participates_IMP_in for Inferred from
mutant phenotype, and so on. The same procedure was applied in the case of located_in.

2.3. Refactoring OWL Punning

The original OGO KB exploited OWL punning6 in
order to translate ontologies written in the OBO format7 to OWL. In the OGO KB each OBO term is represented as an entity with a URI, and depending on the
particular use it can be considered as a class or as an
instance. In other words, the same GO term is seen as
a class when consulting the class hierarchy whereas it
is seen as an instance when it is related to a particular
gene through the relationships participates_in
or located_in.

obo-1_2.shtml

Therefore, the original OBO semantics is preserved
but we are able to perform succinct SPARQL queries
(without having to represent all the OWL axioms as
RDF triples)8.

When using punning, entities can play different
roles and they are differentiated at inference time by
their axiomatic context. However, in a LOD setting this
is not possible so any entity that exploits punning must
be divided in the dataset into different entities (with
different URIs) to represent every role. The entities
were refactored by the process shown in Figure 2.

2.4. Linking to external datasets

The binding process to link entities of the OGOLOD
dataset to external datasets was manually defined. External datasets, such as bio2rdf, were examined to
identify equivalent entities. The common properties
and annotations between internal and external entities
were manually identified to guide the binding process.
Once the manual examination of the external datasets
was completed, custom applications were developed
to run this process. A more detailed description of the
generation of the OGOLOD dataset is provided in [10].

8The general process of translating OBO ontologies to OWL us-

ing punning is described in detail in [2].

predictions of gene function. Hence, obtaining disease
information via clusters of orthologous genes can be
used to find tentative gene functions.

As an example we propose the search for the human
genetic diseases related to the gene Brca1 of the Mus
musculus species stored in bio2rdf.org datasets.
This search is based on the content of OGOLOD and
its external links associated with bio2rdf.org. Figure 3 shows the SPARQL query associated to this ex-
ample: in order to define the query the URL of the
gene9 is required as input. To reference the resources
from bio2rdf.org we exploit the owl:sameAs
relationships that relate OGOLOD resources with
them.

Table 2 shows the result of the query from Figure 3. The resource from bio2rdf.org10 indicates
the OMIM resource with identifier 113705 and it
corresponds to breast cancer. Thus, we can link the
Brca1 gene from Mus musculus species with the
Breast cancer disease resource, stored in separate
bio2rdf.org datasets.

Figure 4 provides another example in which orthologs related to genes involved in lung cancer and
belonging to Rattus Norvegicus are retrieved. The result can be seen in Table 3.

2.5. Known shortcomings of the dataset

The OGOLOD dataset is mainly composed of resources describing clusters of orthologous genes and
genetic diseases, which were obtained from the OGO
KB. The links with external datasets were added during the translation process, so OGOLOD improves the
OGO KB by increasing the number of external links to
published datasets.

The OGOLOD dataset has injected new biomedical
information that was not available to the LOD cloud.
Consequently, the content of the OGOLOD dataset
cannot be linked to the original source repositories,
but to other datasets that publish resources describing
genes and genetic diseases.

Life sciences is one of the most active disciplines
in the publication of LOD datasets [7], thus there
are many potentially linkable resources. However, the
maintenance of high quality links to external datasets
is a complex task due to the large size and diversity of
such datasets. Therefore, methods to improve the management of such links are needed.

2.6. Use cases

The OGOLOD dataset relates orthologous genes
from different species with human genetic disease de-
scriptions. Orthology information is useful to produce

3. Conclusion

The OGOLOD dataset integrates information of orthologous genes and human genetic diseases in a LOD
setting, making it computer-friendly and discoverable
via other LOD links. OGOLOD can be used, for exam-
ple, by scientists interested in studying diseases from a
genetic perspective, using orthology information to infer new research paths for such disease. Providing the
possibility of performing such analyses is OGOLODs
contribution to the LOD cloud, and more importantly,
to translational biomedical research.
