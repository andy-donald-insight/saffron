Abstract. The Linked Brazilian Amazon Rainforest Data contains observations about deforestation of rainforests
and related things such as rivers, road networks, population, amount of cattle, and market prices of agricultural
products. The Linked Data approach offers thus to combine ecological, economical and social dimensions together.
Our aim has been to 1) dramatically shorten the time needed to collect information for a research setting concerning
the Brazilian Amazon, and 2) via the linkage between datasets enable novel types of transdisciplinary research for
the scientific community.

Keywords: Brazilian Amazon, Linked Open Data, Deforestation, Spatio-temporal Datasets

1. Introduction

Open Science needs Open Data to maximize the
transparency, reproducibility and reuse of scientific efforts. An example of a high demand for data
is the research about climate change, for example
about the role of deforestation in it.

Deforestation and its related phenomena such
as market prices of agricultural products form together a complex system. There is an urgent need
to share and publish research data about it, as
it would enable other researchers to interconnect
their data to the published ones. The benefit is
that these explicit interconnections allow for the
analysis of all of the resulting linked data in a
transdisciplinary manner. Thus the whole complex
socio-economic and environmental system could
be modelled and not just subsets of it.

In this paper our contribution is to describe
how large amounts of remote sensing observation
data about the Brazilian Amazon Rainforest has
been published as Linked Spatiotemporal Data.
The data covers the whole Brazilian Amazon Rain-

forest. Moreover, we show how this data can be
further accessed and analyzed using R statistical
computing environment by openly available methods via a tutorial. We argue that this is a contribution towards Linked Science[3,2], where not just
publications, but data, methods, tools, and other
scientific assets are interconnected and shared on-
line. The work is a continuation of our earlier
work[4], but with substantial additions to the published dataset.

2. Linked Brazilian Amazon Rainforest Data

2.1. Linking a Diverse Variety of Data Together

Governments maintain a diverse amount of different registerse.g. about population, export,
employment, river structures, etc.for decision
making. These data are also very valuable in statistical analysis for finding correlations between
different phenomena. Open and broad access in a
uniform way to such data eases and enables scientific research.

Our aim is to create a unique dataset which we
call the Linked Brazilian Amazon Rainforest Data
(LBARD). The goal is to enhance research about
deforestation. Motivation is that while the Brazilian government and increasingly also other authorities provides public access to data as spread-
sheets, the linkage between these data is missing.
Thus this creates challenges to conduct e.g. timeseries or spatial analysis.

2.2. Study Area

The study area is the Brazilian Amazon rain-
forest, which covers an area of more than 5 million square kilometers. Data representing defor-
estation, land uses pasture, temporary and permanent agricultureand natural and social factors of change were aggregated to grid cells of 25
km x 25 km, counting a total of 8580 cells. For
each cell of the resulting grid, there are 38 natural and social factors available, grouped into eight
categoriesland use, demography, environmental,
accessibility to markets, technology, public policy,
market pressure and agrarian structure. Each of
the variable was described similarly as below the
variable DEFOR_2004 (which is used to describe
the percentage of new deforestation in 2004 for
each grid cell).

2.3. Describing Deforestation and Land Uses

We made use of the Landsat TM-based 19972007 deforestation maps produced under the
Amazon-monitoring program of the Brazilian National Institute for Space Research (INPE) in year
2010. The percentages of accumulated deforestation in different years were computed for each grid
cell. The accumulated deforestation in 1997 and
2007 was decomposed into the main agricultural
usespasture, temporary and permanent agricul-

tures. Economical data provided by Brazils Informa Economics FNP, number of conservation
units provided by the Brazilian Ministry of Environment (MMA), and distances to road structures
from data by the Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia
e Estatistica (IBGE) were aggregated to the grid
level in a similar manner.

The excerpt below shows an example grid cell
with accumulated and yearly deforestation values.

2.4. Processing and Describing Data from Data

Portals

In order to process and describe other statistical data1 such as census data, we developed an
application capable of downloading from IBGE2
data portal, and transforming spreadsheets into
Linked Data. The process made use of the Open
Linked Amazon (OLA)3 vocabulary tailored for
this purpose, and a number of established vocab-
ularies. Open Linked Amazon vocabulary assembles classes and properties describing specific measuring units and variables used for the Brazilian
government for publishing records. The time series are built on observations of a specific variable in a certain time period. The OLA Vocabulary was also in use to describe data for the project
Dreieck der Nachhaltigkeit (Triangle of Sustain-
ability4), which participated the German science
competition Wissenschaft im Dialog 2012"5.
Below is an example excerpt from the data.

2.5. Enriching Data with Spatial Relationships

The spatial aspects of data were modelled using the Open Time and Space Core Vocabulary (TISC)6. Missing classes and properties were
added as an extension of TISC. For example, in
order to enable spatial data aggregation capabil-
ities, (like aggregating municipalitys population
into states) properties expressing the amount of
partial overlap between different regions were de-
fined, understanding overlap as the spatial intersection among two spatial objects.

This is critical for relating the study area grid
to other information available e.g. the population of a municipality with different aggregation
level. This modelling decision allows to estimate
the value of a variable when aggregated spatially
between different granularities. An example is a
grids cell overlapping two or more different mu-
nicipalities. If an approximation of the population
density is needed at the grid level, then properties

like the overlap ratio enable to aggregate the population data at the grid level. Below is an excerpt
of this data to give an example.

As a result of the dataset contains the following

data:

Amount of Deforestation The observed deforestation aggregated to grid cells (see [1] for details
of how the aggregation was done).

Cattle The total number of heads of cattle grouped

by municipality.

Legal Amazon Grid This grid covers the whole
Legal Amazon area divided in 8480 cells with
the size of 25km x 25km.

Municipalities and Federal States A complete compound of Brazilian Federal States which belong to the Legal Amazon area and their mu-
nicipalities, together with their geographical
location and covered area.

Permanent Crops Crops of produced from specific
plants which last for many seasons classified
by hectares of planted and harvested area,
thousand reais, metric tons and kg/hectare.
The permanent crops are linked to an observation and additionally its plants are linked
to their respectively entries in DBPedia7.

Population per municipality Census 2000 and 2010,
and population projections from 2001 to 2009.
Temporary Crops Crops of produced from specific
plants which last for less than one year classified by hectares of planted and harvested
area, thousand reais, thousand fruits, metric
tons and kg/hectare. The temporary crops are
linked to an observation and additionally its
plants are also linked to their respectively entries in DBPedia.

Rivers Rivers which geographically overlap a Le-

gal Amazon Grid cell.

River Basins River basins which geographically

overlap a Legal Amazon Grid cell.

2.6. Metrics and statistics

Table 1 reports the variety and amounts of data
that was linked together, to external datasets, and
which vocabularies were in use for different types
of data. The column total external links show the
amount of data linked to DBPedia: Brazilian mu-
nicipalities, data sources and permanent and temporary crops (cultivated grains). The choice for
linking the Amazon Rainforest dataset to DBPedia was based on the huge amount of its incoming
links from other datasets and the absence of more
dedicated Linked Open Data data source for the
Rainforest dataset purposes.

3. Example Use Case: Accessing the Data from R

One crucial aspect is how to access and analyse data, and especially how to get only that part
of data which is of interest for a given research
question. Linked Data solves the access part, and
SPARQL allows to query only a subset of the data.
For statistical computing there are tools like R9,
and a separate package10 [5] for it supports querying Linked Data.

As an example use case we provide an online
tutorial11 to explore the data from R and plot it
on maps. The aim here is support bridging of the
two communities, those of statistical computing
and the semantic web.

The original plan was to use The Statistical
Core Vocabulary (SCOVO)12 for describing the
data, but we changed the plan since SCOVO got
deprecated. However, we are currently exploring
the possibility of using RDF Data Cube vocabu-
lary13, but its W3C status as draft implies risk on
using it, making more sense to use the OLA vocabulary for later linking or migration when RDF
Data Cube becomes a W3C recommendation.

However, we showed in this paper that we provide 1) an extensive amount of external linkage,
and also 2) make use common vocabularies, and
that 3) the published dataset as such can be used
for extensive analysis of related phenomena concerning the Brazilian Amazon Rainforest. In the
future work we plan to extend the dataset further
by including diverse open data concerning ecolog-
ical, economical and social aspects related to rain-
forests. Moreover, we are currently developing a
set of applications that make use of the data. We
hope to learn via these experiments and evaluations about both the potential and the future development needs of the dataset.

5. Conclusions

In this paper we described the Brazilian Linked
Rainforest Data. We argue that the version 2.0 of
the Brazilian Amazon Linked Rainforest Data to
be a major step in having open and linked data
about the ecological, economical and social dimensions related to and about the Brazilian Amazon
Rainforest. The data has been published using the
Linked Open Data principles. The dataset provides a centralized, structured and heterogeneous
source of information. We have the aim that it facilitates the access to important data for research
and thus gives a valuable support to make scientific analysis of the Brazilian Amazon Rainforest.
The emerging application scenarios such as statistical and visual analysis show that the dataset has
a practical value.
