This final issue 6 of the year 2014 contains five
regular submissions, which brings the total number of published papers (not counting editorials)
in 2014 to 23. It also closes the first year in which
we have published six issues, rather than four as
in 2013 and 2012, and this reflects a significant increase in the number of submissions which we are
receiving. Of course we expect that the number of
submissions will sooner or later reach a plateau:
For now we have another six issues scheduled for
2015.

The first paper in this issue, Hybrid Reasoning on OWL RL, by Jacopo Urbani, Robert Piro,
Frank van Harmelen and Henri Bal, is a regular
research paper. It presents the techniques underlying the QueryPIE system for backward-chaining
reasoning involving OWL RL on very large RDF
data sets.

The second paper, An Egocentric Semantic Reference System for Affordances, by Jens Ortmann,

Giorgio De Felice, Dong Wang and Desiree Daniel,
is also a regular research paper which suggests
a theory of egocentric semantic reference systems
for human observations of affordances that can be
used to semantically account for subjective human
observations on the Web.

The third paper, How Ontologies Benefit Enterprise Applications, by Daniel Oberle, is a regular
research paper on the benefit of ontologies for enterprise applications.

The fourth paper, by Nadjet Bouayad-Agha,
Gerard Casamayor and Leo Wanner, is a Survey
Article on Natural Language Generation in the
context of the Semantic Web.

The fifth and final paper, by Paolo Ciccarese
and Silvio Peroni, is an Ontology Description on
The Collections Ontology: creating and handling
collections in OWL 2 DL frameworks.
