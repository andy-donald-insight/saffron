ABSTRACT
Together with the latest efforts in publishing Linked (Open)
Data, legal issues around publishing and consuming such
data are gaining increased interest. Particular areas of interest include (i) how to define more expressive access policies which go beyond common licenses, (ii) how to introduce
pricing models for online datasets (for non-open data) and
(iii) how to realize (i)+(ii) while providing descriptions of
respective meta data that is both human readable and machine processable. In this paper, we show based on different
examples that the Open Digital Rights Language (ODRL)
Ontology 2.0 is able to address all previous mentioned issues,
i.e.
is suitable to express a large variety of different access
policies for Linked Data. By defining policies as ODRL in
RDF we aim for (i) higher flexibility and simplicity in usage,
(ii) machine/human readability and (iii) fine-grained policy
expressions for Linked (Open) Data.

INTRODUCTION

1.
Publishing data on the Web usually involves more than
just making it accessible for the public. Following the design principles for publishing Linked Data proposed by Tim
Berners-Lee [1] is a first step towards the publication of a
well structured Linked Dataset but, unfortunately, those
principles offer no guidelines for defining fine-grained and
expressive meta data to which purposes and under which
conditions such data may be used, such as e.g for defining
access policies. The openness of the Web and the lack of

standard mechanisms to define (and enforce) expressive access restrictions in a way that is both human readable and
machine processable, might in fact prevent data owners from
publishing their datasets [5]. Another important aspect is
(monetary) cost caused by gathering and preparing the data.
Despite the general trend towards openness and transparent
availability of date, if there is no possibility to regain some of
the expenses made during creating and curating a dataset,
data owners might not see any benefit from publishing it.

In order to address these issues and to demonstrate data
owners a possibility to easily define expressive access policies for Linked Data using a common rights expression lan-
guage, in this short paper we look into the suitability of the
Open Digital Rights Language 2.0 Ontology1 as a candidate for achieving this task, by discussing example scenarios
with their respective policies and their realization using the
ODRL vocabulary. While previous work has already hinted
on the possibility of using ODRL for expressing Linked Data
licences [2]

The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: in Section 2 we give an introduction into ODRL and investigate
constructs which are particularly important for the domain
of Linked Data, Section 3 underpins our choice of using
ODRL to express access policies for Linked Data by providing a set of use cases and their ODRL representations.
In Section 4 we discuss related work in the field of access
policies and restrictions for Linked Data before we conclude
(Section 5).

2. OPEN DIGITAL RIGHTS LANGUAGE 2.0
The Open Digital Rights Language (ODRL) was invented
to provide an open standard for defining policy expressions
for digital content and media. The ODRL Core Model (cf.
Figure1) contains all major components of an ODRL policy
expression.

In the following we will discuss the different main components in more detail and will especially only focus on parts
of the ODRL vocabulary which might be relevant for the
domain of Linked (Open) Data.

Policy A Policy is the central entity that forms ODRL
It can refer to Permissions and

policy expressions.

1http://www.w3.org/community/odrl/


Prohibitions which hold for that Policy; policies be
further distinguished into several subtypes, namely:

(i) An Agreement is a policy expression, which represent a formal contract or license containing the involved Parties and the respective terms of usage.
In contrast to general license definitions, which
are realized as Sets, an Agreement explicitly defines the Parties amongst the access conditions
(i.e. Permissions and Prohibitions) were stip-
ulated.

(ii) An Offer is used if an Asset owner wants to represent (e.g., as advertisement) possible access conditions which are usually linked to Duties in absence of a concrete Party consuming the Asset.
(e.g. Access to perform ASK Queries on a specific dataset is granted in exchange for a payment
of 400 Euro. or cf. Listing 3)

(iii) Set:

if general terms of usage shall be defined
which do not have any Constraints or Duties
attached, Sets can be used. This type of Policy can also be used to represent common Open
Data licenses such as Creative Commons (CC)2
licenses.

(iv) A Ticket is a policy expression that stipulates
the terms of usage between an Asset owner and
any Party who currently holds such Ticket in
possession.

Asset An Asset is the entity whose terms of usage are restricted by its surrounding policy expression. In the
domain of Linked (Open) Data an Asset is usually a
dataset or parts of a dataset.

Party A Party can be distinguished into Assigner (the
party who proposes the policy statements) and a Assignee (the one who receives the policy statements).

2http://creativecommons.org/ns

Permission A Permission allows that a specific Action is
executed on a particular Asset (e.g. Read data from
dataset <dataset1>.). In addition,

(i) Constraints restrict that Permission and define
it in more detail (e.g. Read data from dataset
<dataset1> until December 31st),

(ii) Parties can be defined between whom the policy is stipulated (e.g. Company XYZ allows user
Alice to read data from dataset <dataset1> until
December 31st), as well as

(iii) Duties which must be fulfilled beforehand in order for the Permission to become valid (e.g. Company XYZ allows user Alice to read data from
dataset <dataset1> until December 31st, if Alice
pays 400EUR.),

can be attached.

Prohibition In contrast to Permissions, Prohibitions are
used to forbid specific Actions on an Asset (e.g. In
general, no one is allowed to read data from dataset
<dataset1>.) and cannot refer to Duties.

Duty As already exmplified above, a Duty defines a certain Action which has to be executed by a potential
Assignee for the Permission to become valid.

Action Actions are operations which a potential Assignee
is allowed (if related to a Permission), is prohibited
(if related to a Prohibition) or has (if related to a
Duty) to perform. We have investigated different actions which can be used to describe common actions
taken within a Linked Data scenario, namely:3

aggregate The act of using the asset (or parts of
it) as part of a composite collection. In the domain of Linked Data, aggregates can be used to
express the action of querying different datasets

3For a list of available actions, we refer readers to http:
//www.w3.org/community/odrl/two/vocab/


owner can permit the querying of its dataset but
only if the results are not aggregated with those
from other data sources).

read The act of obtaining data from the asset. Among
the various different Actions defined withing the
ODRL vocabulary read does best fit the intended
meaning of a SPARQL query or retrieving (parts
of) a dataset, in general.

write The act of writing to the asset. Thinking in
the scope of querying Linked Data resources, write
can be used to represent SPARQL INSERT, and
may be used for SPARQL UPDATE queries, although the latter case does not fit the intended semantics of write perfectly since write only specifies the action of writing to and not deleting from
the asset.

delete The act of permanently removing the asset.
delete can be used to express SPARQL DELETE
and (partially) SPARQL UPDATE, but again without having the same intended semantics, not capturing inserts. While delete specifies the complete deletion of an Asset, SPARQL DELETE
and (partially) SPARQL UPDATE usually only
delete parts from an Asset.

nextPolicy Generally speaking, this Action is used
to refer to policy restrictions which have to hold
for derived Assets of the original Asset.

Constraint With Constraints it is possible to restrict and
limit the scope of Permissions, Prohibitions and
Duties, using a simple mathematical structure with
two operands and one operator (e.g. The number of
query requests (operand) must be less or equal (oper-
ator) than 100 (operand). Such constraints could 
again in the context of SPARQL  be used to advertise
restrictions on the usage of services such as SPARQL
endpoints, e.g. using ODRL as part of a SPARQL 1.1
service description [14].

3. EXPRESSING ACCESS POLICIES FOR

LINKED DATA IN ODRL 2.0

Although there are numerous possible scenarios where access
restrictions play an important role, we have identified six
common use-cases which should be expressible and which
we will realize with ODRL.

Restricting access to specific parties and datasets

Maybe one of the most common and basic requirements for any rights expression language is the possibility to restrict access to specific users and/or restrict access to specific assets. A possible example is
shown in the example underneath, where user :aliceis
granted the permission to read only datasets dataset1
and dataset2.
@ prefix odrl : < http :// w3 . org / ns / odrl /2/ > .
@ prefix : < http :// www . example . com / > .

< listing1 > a odrl : P e r m i s s i o n ;

odrl : action odrl : read ;
odrl : target

</ dataset1 > , </ dataset2 >;

odrl : a s s i g n e r : owner ;
odrl : a s s i g n e e : alice .

Limiting number of request A more advanced policy is
exemplified in the following listing. It expresses an access policy which restricts the number of allowed read
requests for the purpose of sp:Ask (i.e. performing
ASK queries) to 100 and furthermore stores its current status. Such a scenario is especially feasible in
combination with payment duties, where a party gets
the permission to perform a number of requests if it
pays a certain amount for it.
@ prefix odrl : < http :// w3 . org / ns / odrl /2/ > .
@ prefix spin : < http :// spinrdf . org / sp / > .

< listing2 > a odrl : P e r m i s s i o n ;

odrl : action odrl : read ;
odrl : target </ dataset >;
odrl : c o n s t r a i n t [

a odrl : C o n s t r a i n t ;

odrl : purpose sp : Ask ;
odrl : o p e r a t o r odrl : lteq ;
odrl : count " 100 " ^^ xsd : integer ;
odrl : status " 42 " ^^ xsd : integer ] .

Allowing access only in specific time windows It is also

possible to allow (or forbid) access within specific time
windows only as illustrated in the listing underneath.
Again, this is especially useful in scenarios where data
owners want to restrict access to data or services based
on server workload or payment issues (e.g. more popular time windows are more expensive).
@ prefix odrl : < http :// w3 . org / ns / odrl /2/ > .
@ prefix spin : < http :// spinrdf . org / sp / > .

< listing3 > a odrl : P e r m i s s i o n ;

odrl : action odrl : read ;
odrl : target </ dataset >;
odrl : c o n s t r a i n t [

a odrl : C o n s t r a i n t ;
odrl : purpose sp : Ask ;
odrl : o p e r a t o r odrl : lteq ;
odrl : d a t e T i m e

" 2016 -12 -31 " ^^ xsd : date ] .

Representing licenses As already discussed, ODRL can
also be used to represent common licenses in RDF as
it includes all necessary constructs to do so.
@ prefix odrl : < http :// w3 . org / ns / odrl /2/ > .
@ prefix : < http :// www . example . com > .

% CC - BY - NC - SA
< listing4 > a odrl : Set ;

odrl : p e r m i s s i o n odrl : r e p r o d u c e ;
odrl : p e r m i s s i o n odrl : d i s t r i b u t e ;
odrl : p e r m i s s i o n odrl : derive ;
odrl : duty odrl : a t t r i b u t i o n ;
odrl : duty odrl : a t t a c h P o l i c y ;
odrl : duty odrl : s h a r e A l i k e ;
odrl : p r o h i b i t o n odrl : c o m m e r c i a l i z e .

Restricting data-reuse policy An important  an so far
under-researched in terms of technical solutions [9] 
aspect of publishing data on the web and especially
in combination with restricted data is the definition
of data re-use policies. Although a data owner might
have granted a party to use its data, the owner usually
does not want to pass this permission to downstream


define such re-use policies.
@ prefix odrl : < http :// w3 . org / ns / odrl /2/ > .
@ prefix : < http :// www . example . com / > .

step, which is formalizing ODRL policies for linked data in
a machine-processable way. To this end we shall check other
earlier machine-readable and -processable formalizations of
policies such as PROTUNE [3], REI [7], or XACML [10].

< listing5 > a odrl : P e r m i s s i o n ;

odrl : action odrl : d i s t r i b u t e ;
odrl : target </ dataset >;
odrl : duty [

a odrl : Duty ;
odrl : action odrl : n e x t P o l i c y ;
odrl : target : n e w P o l i c y ] .

: n e w P o l i c y a odrl : Set ;

odrl : p e r m i s s i o n [

a odrl : P e r m i s s i o n ;
odrl : action odrl : display ;
odrl : target </ dataset > ] .

Introducing payment duties As already mentioned above,

the possibility to define payment duties which have to
be fulfilled in order get a certain permission is a crucial part for our Linked Data scenario. In ODRL, such
payment duties can be easily defined and assigned to
any permission or duty as exemplified in the listing
underneath.
@ prefix odrl : < http :// w3 . org / ns / odrl /2/ > .
@ prefix gr : < http :// purl . org / goodrel / v1 # >.

< listing6 > a odrl : P e r m i s s i o n ;

odrl : action odrl : read ;
odrl : target </ dataset >;
odrl : duty [

a odrl : Duty ;
odrl : action odrl : pay ;
odrl : target [

a gr : U n i t P r i c e S p e c i f i c a t i o n ;
gr : h a s C u r r e n c y V a l u e

" 400 " ^^ xsd : float ;

gr : h a s C u r r e n c y

" EUR " ^^ xsd : string

] .

4. RELATED WORK
To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to suggest the
ODRL vocabulary for defining more expressive access policies in RDF for Linked Data. Cabrio et al. [2] use ODRL
to represent licenses in their recently proposed natural language approach for automatically generating RDF licenses.
In addition to represent licenses as ODRL policies, we use
ODRL to express more detailed access restrictions. Other
approaches which use ontologies to define access policies
are the Privacy Preference Ontology (PPO) [12] and the
SHI3LD Model [4, 5]. Both of them define their own ontology to be used for defining access policies and use SPARQL
ASK queries to verify them. Our approach differs from theirs,
since we reused an already established standard rights expression language rather than defining our own one for modeling access policies.

Other approaches such as M uhleisen et al. [8], which propose a SWRL-based strategy to define access policies, or
Villata et al. [13] and Rodriguez et al. [11] which focus on
investigating and representing license definitions for Linked
Data, address only parts of possible scenarios where access
restriction is necessary, but could be relevant for our next

5. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper we proposed ODRL as suitable for expressing more fine-grained access policies for Linked Data by investigating the core concepts of ODRL itself and providing
a number of listings to underpin our proposition. While
ODRL was initially intended to be used to define an open
standard for policy expressions for digital media, we proved
that it is also suitable for expressing access policies within
the domain of Linked Data.

Future work will include the development of a framework,
capable of using and checking access policies defined in ODRL
and a more thoroughly evaluation of different access policy
frameworks.
