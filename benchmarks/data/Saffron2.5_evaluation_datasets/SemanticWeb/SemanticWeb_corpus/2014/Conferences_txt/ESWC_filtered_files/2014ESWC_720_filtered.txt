Abstract.  Recommender  systems  are  an  important  technology  component  for 
many e-commerce applications. In short, they are technical means that suggest 
potentially relevant products and services to the users of a Web site, typically a 
shop. The recommendations are computed in advance or during the actual visit 
and use various types of data as input, in particular past purchases and the purchasing  behavior  of  other  users  with  similar  preferences.  One  major  problem 
with recommender systems is that the quality of recommendations depends on 
the amount, quality, and representativeness of the information about items already owned by the visitor, e.g. from past purchases at that particular shop. For 
first-time visitors and customers migrating from other merchants, the amount of 
available information is often too small to generate good recommendations. To-
day, shopping history data for a single user is fragmented and spread over multiple sites, and cannot be actively exposed by the user to additional shops.  

In  this  paper,  we  propose  to  use  Semantic  Web  technology,  namely  
GoodRelations and schema.org, to empower e-commerce customers to (1) collect and manage ownership information about products, (2) detect if a shop site 
is  interested  in  such  information  in  exchange  for  better  recommendations  or 
other incentives, and (3) expose the information to such shop sites directly from 
their browser. We then sketch how a shop site could use the ownership information to recommend relevant products.

Introduction 

Recommender  systems  are  an  established  part  of  e-commerce  systems.  They  help 
prospective  customers  to  navigate  the  myriad  of  products  offered  in  an  online  shop 
and  aid  them  with  finding  a  product  that  best  matches  their  needs  and  preferences. 
Many  recommender  systems  require  or  benefit  from  data  about  past  purchases  or 
items ratings. This  means that they perform  well if  the  user has already a shopping 
history in that particular system, and perform poorly when facing a first-time user that

has not yet rated or purchased an item in a given shop. From the user's perspective, 
her rating and purchase history is scattered across many shop systems, which she has 
visited  in  the  past.  Accessing  and  sharing  one's  entire  shopping  history,  or  a  subset 
thereof, could likely provide better personalization and better recommendations. 

We  also  argue  that  purchase  records  are  not  necessarily  representative  when  it 
comes  to  preferences.  For  instance,  people  do  not  always  buy  products  for  them-
selves. A one-time purchase of a cosmetic product for the wife does not mean that a 
husband has a longer-term personal interest in it. Therefore, we focus on collecting, 
managing and sharing actual item ownership information, as we believe it is a better indicator of personal preferences. 

One of the key problems that prohibit a wider availability of ownership information is that parts of one's shopping history are locked up in multiple, proprietary data 
representations. Our goal is to develop a common data representation and exchange 
protocol that could improve existing recommender systems and open up new possibilities for shop systems for better understanding their customers. 

1.1  Role of Item Ownership Information in Recommender Systems 

Most contemporary recommender systems do not rely on actual data about items being owned by users; instead, they use past purchases, or items viewed previously, to 
infer  likely  ownership;  for  an  overview,  see  e.g.  [11].  In  particular,  Collaborative 
Filtering  (CF)  algorithms  have  been  successfully  applied  to  the  problem  of  product 
recommendation.  The  numerous  existing  CF  algorithms  share  two  common  proper-
ties:  (1)  they  maintain  a  matrix  of  item  ratings  R  or  purchases  where  a  Ri,j  entry 
represents that a Useri rated/purchased Itemj and based on this (2) calculate a ranked 
list of top-N items that might appeal to a given user [1]. Our focus in this paper is the 
use  of  ownership  information,  hence  we  limit  our  discussion  to  past  purchases,  although CF algorithms apply to item ratings and other forms of user-item interaction  
as well. 

Let Userc be the current user for whom the recommended list of items should be 
computed. The user-based CF algorithms employ clustering techniques over R to find 
other users that have similar preferences to Userc, that is, their purchase record has a 
significant overlap with that of Userc [cf. 1, 11]. 

Another flavor of CF algorithms are item-based CF algorithms. The core of these 
algorithms  is  the  item-similarity  matrix  S,  where  Si,j  denotes  a  similarity  between 
Itemi and Itemj [1]. The item-similarity matrix is derived from the frequency of purchasing or positively rating two particular items for each item pair [1, 11]. The output 
is a ranked list of items likely to be purchased by Userc. 

Markov-chain based (a.k.a next-basket prediction)  methods [6] model purchasing 
as a probabilistic sequential process and attempt to predict the next set of items likely 
to be purchased by the user. In other words, they consider the temporal relations between purchases of items. The explicit cause of the next-item relevance remain typically undefined even in semantically augmented CF approaches, such as [4], where a 
product  taxonomy  is  employed  in  order  to  better  capture  consecutive  purchases  of 
related items,  for example a  camera, followed by a tripod and an additional camera

Portability Barriers on Item Ownership Information 

Currently,  the  exchange  of  information  about  owned  items  between  users  and  Web 
sites is hampered by the following limitations: 
(1) Purchasing  records  as  structured  data  are  mostly  available  only  within  shop  site 
applications but not on the machines of users. While users receive purchasing confirmation and invoices, those are typically only unstructured text1. 

(2) There is no common data model for representing and sharing ownership informa-

tion. 

(3) There  is  no  common  protocol  for  initiating  and  governing  the  exchange  of  item 

ownership information between users and Web sites. 

Currently,  only  product  model  master  data  is  exchanged  between  partners  in  value 
chains, mostly via XML-based product catalogs, and product models of commodities 
are identified via product identifiers like the standardized Global Trade Item Number2 
(GTIN). There is, however, no standard way of representing, managing, and sharing 
item ownership information from a users perspective. 

1.4  Our contribution 

In this paper, we describe a conceptual model, an RDF-based syntax, and a protocol that allow users to actively share information about items owned with Web appli-
cations, thus empowering the latter to provide better recommendations even for firsttime users. Our paper is structured as follows: In Section 2, we present a motivating 
scenario, and develop the conceptual model and its machine-processable representation based on schema.org in combination with an exchange protocol. In Section 3, we 
describe  two  relevant  product  recommender  scenarios  based  on  ownership  informa-
tion. In section 4, we provide preliminary evidence for the viability and relevance of 
our proposed method. 

User-Managed Ownership Information 

2.1  Our Approach 

Our goal is to augment the typical interaction pattern between a user and a Web shop 
by the ability to share information about items owned by the user in exchange for a 
more personalized shopping experience or other incentives, as sketched in Figure 2. 
To enable this interaction pattern, both the user's Web browser and the shop system 
must  support  (1)  the  common  data  model  and  (2)  the  exchange  protocol  described  
in 2.4. 

  This  may  improve  by  the  availability  of  the  support  for  transactions  in  schema.org, 
http://schema.org/Order, and schema.org markup in JSON-LD in email messages, 
see https://developers.google.com/gmail/actions/

paper,  along  with  the  attributes  s:typeOfGood  referring  to  the  owned  Product; 
s:ownedFrom,  s:ownedTo  denoting  temporal  bounds  of  ownership  and  the 
attribute s:acquiredFrom pointing to the source of the item.

2.3  Data Management 

One  open  issue  with  handling  ownership  information  is  that  we  need  to  make  sure 
that the information about items owned stays in sync with the purchasing and disposal 
of  items,  and  we  need  to  organize  the  initial  exchange,  and  update  of  previously 
shared,  information  with  sites.  In  other  words,  we  need  to  address  how  data  is  
acquired, stored and edited, and shared. These are responsibilities of the client implementing the data model and the exchange protocol described in this paper. Our prototype client7 currently supports manual form-based entry and the import of Amazon.de 
purchase history data. Other viable sources are extracting data from purchase receipts. 
These  are  usually  poorly  structured  and  manual  intervention  is  likely  necessary.  As 
for storing the data, multiple options are available, either storing it locally or storing it 
remotely.  Our  reference  implementation  uses  the  browsers  local  storage,  since  this 
can be accessed from a browser extension and does not involve tackling access con-
trol, as it would be in a remote-storage scenario. Other capabilities, such as sharing 
ownership  information  selectively  are  also  part  of  the  client  implementation,  hence 
independent from our data model and protocol. 

2.4 

Protocol for Exchanging Ownership Information 

We define a minimal protocol for exchanging over HTTP. Our only concern here is to 
support  data  exchange.  How  the  recipient  will  actually  use  ownership  information 
(OI) is not in the scope of our protocol. The protocol consists of three abstract phases: 

1.  Discovery:  A  Web  shop  advertises  interest  in  receiving  ownership  info 

and a capable client detects this intent.

serves as a valuable additional input for the next time the item-similarity matrix S is 
recomputed. 

In order to provide some evidence for the further utility of item ownership information for a more personalized shopping experience, we will present two rule-based 
scenarios  that  rely  on  the  availability  of  rich  product  data  in  a  shop  system.  In  the 
following, we will implement the recommender rules as SPARQL queries to demonstrate interesting inferences, as they are high level, declarative, yet directly executa-
ble.  Depending  on  the  problem  scale,  i.e.  the  number  of  items  involved,  real-time 
requirements, a real-world implementation may have to use optimizations. 

Our process for obtaining useful recommendations is as follows: 

1.  Request product ownership information. 
2.  Add it to the shop's database. 
3.  Run recommender rules formulated as SPARQL queries over the new, in-

tegrated knowledge base. 

3.1 

Interpreting Transmitted Item Information 

Although  our  data  model  places  both  the  client  and  the  shop  system  in  a  common 
frame of reference with respect to data schema, there is no single canonical reference 
to  items  that  would  serve  as  identity  check.  Product  names  or  labels  (given  by 
s:name) prove rather unreliable for this purpose due to their variability and language 
dependence. There could be two slightly different product labels or two semantically 
equivalent labels in two different languages referring to the same product. These are 
the same issues that arise when merging data originated from two different sources. 
Therefore, in our following scenarios, we only consider items received from the client 
for which a strong identifier is provided, such as GTIN13, which is globally unique 
for commodities. If such a strong identifier is available, establishing a link to a known 
product in the database is efficient and trivial. 

Alternatively,  product  classification  information  referring  to  a  widely  deployed 
taxonomy, such as the Google Product Taxonomy8 can provide valuable insights into 
the user's interest. 

3.2  Related Product Recommendation 

Due to the increasing number of specific products available in a single shop, it is not 
always  easy  for  the  non-expert  user  to  choose  the  correct  spare  part  or  compatible 
product for an already owned product. High quality product catalogs typically define 
these relationships, so they can be used to aid the user in her search for the right prod-
uct.  schema.org  defines  s:isConsumableFor  and  s:isAccessoryOrSparePart 
attributes  to  denote  such  relationships  between  two  products,  which  we  use  in  
our rule.

R1 presents a SPARQL query that retrieves all products that are suitable accessories 
or spare parts for any recognized item in the  user's possession. For example, it  will 
retrieve paper bags that are compatible with the user's vacuum cleaner or recommend 
a laptop bag for the user's 13" laptop. Ranking the result set can be performed using 
arbitrary criteria. In our example, we resort to ranking the results by item popularity. 

3.3 

Successor Product Recommendation 

Recommending successor products is a common marketing tactic. In schema.org, the 
s:successorOf property denotes a successor relationship between two products. 
Assuming the user is in possession of a Phone123 smartphone and the shop system 
has the fact  

:phone124 s:successorOf :phone123. 

available,  recommending  an  upgrade  to  Phone124  may  prove  valuable  to  the  user. 
Collaborative  filtering  system  will  typically  capture  the  correlation  between  a 
Phone123 and Phone124, as users interested in Phone123 may likely be interested in 
Phone124,  too.  However,  a  user,  who  has  just  purchased  a  Phone123  device  is  less 
likely to find a Phone124 recommendation useful [cf. 8]. 
Our semantic recommender rule is able to make a better decision based on knowing 
how long a given item has been in the possession of the user. Assuming that the shop 
system  has  data  on  the  average  product  lifetime,  that  is,  the  average  period  after  a 
product is replaced, represented as  

:phone123 :avgProductLTMonths 24. 

Then, the R2 rule presented below finds all successor products to the ones owned by 
the user and which are already past their average life-time.

Evaluation and Future Work 

We indicated earlier that the current recommender systems can benefit from access to 
ownership information in order to mitigate the cold-start problem and the data sparsity  issue.  For  the  future,  we  expect  that  precise  and  granular  ownership  information 
can be best leveraged by novel rule-based expert systems. These systems will capture 
expert-level domain-specific product recommendation knowledge and in effect act as 
automated sales assistants. 

4.1  Expert Survey 

During our initial investigation, we interviewed six e-commerce experts who possess 
domain knowledge in multiple product domains. The goal was to assess the relevance 
of information about items owned by the customer in order to improve recommendations in different product categories. For example, we wanted to know whether these 
human experts think they can provide more relevant recommendations for a customer 
in the area of consumer electronics if they knew about all the furniture owned. They 
were  asked  to  rate  all  combinations  of  five  item  category  pairs  on  a  5-level  Likert 
scale. The categories were picked from the set of categories most frequently bought 
online [2]. Apart from three cases, our experts reached consensus, which means that 
the majority settled on two adjacent scores in all cases but three. The diagonal of the 
matrix  naturally  received  the  highest  utility  assessment.  However,  some  categories 
can be useful to slightly improve product recommendations in other categories as well 
(see Table 1).

4.2  User study 

Another important factor of the viability of our approach is how willing the users are 
to share information about their belongings. There are situations where the perceived 
breach to privacy  may outweigh the promised additional personalization effects and 
the  users  will  be  likely  to  refuse  to  reveal  sensitive  information.  A  user  study  described in [9] focused on personal data, e.g. name, email address, whereas we focus 
on revealing information about ones belongings. Also, users may be more likely to 
reveal certain categories of items than others. The online shops reputation is expected 
to be a very important trust factor, when deciding whether to share any information 
with  it.  Online  shops  can  encourage  sharing  by  offering  various  incentives,  such  as 
discounts or free shipping. They can also explicitly declare how they intend to use the 
acquired information to alleviate users concerns. 

In  general,  measuring  privacy  concerns  of  users  is  very  difficult  [see  e.g.  10]. 
Therefore, in our work, we resorted to simulated decision making in practical scena-
rios. In order to provide some preliminary evidence that  users are indeed  willing to 
reveal information about their belongings in certain situations, we conducted a study, 
in  which  users  were asked to complete  five simulated decision-making situations in 
an online shopping context9.

In each situation, the user was told that she or he is looking for an item on the Web 
and just discovered a promising online shop that she or he decided to visit. After being taken to the site, a dialog box appeared asking the user to reveal some of her or his 
items of a certain category, which were related to the shopping task at hand. The standard incentive always offered in exchange for revealing the information was reduced 
search time and better personalized service. Additionally, monetary incentives such 
as free shipping or a 10% discount on the next purchase were offered with a 0.5 prob-
ability.  Table  2  contains  the  situations  in  the  order  of  appearance,  the  information 
requested, and the additional incentive.

We  collected  responses  from  31  individuals  (men  and  women,  aged  20-50)  over 
the  Web  who  declared  themselves  as  knowledgeable  in  matters  of  online  shopping. 
All respondents revealed the requested item category at least in one of the model situations (see Figure 5). In Figure 6 one can see that for almost all item categories, 50% 
or more of the respondents were willing to share information about owned items. It 
seems  that  in  our  model  situations,  the  incentives  actually  had  a  slightly  negative
