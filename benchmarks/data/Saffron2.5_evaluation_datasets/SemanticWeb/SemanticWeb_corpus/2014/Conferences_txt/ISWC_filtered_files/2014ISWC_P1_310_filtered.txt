Abstract. In order to support web applications to understand the content of HTML pages an increasing number of websites have started to
annotate structured data within their pages using markup formats such
as Microdata, RDFa, Microformats. The annotations are used by Google,
Yahoo!, Yandex, Bing and Facebook to enrich search results and to
display entity descriptions within their applications. In this paper, we
present a series of publicly accessible Microdata, RDFa, Microformats
datasets that we have extracted from three large web corpora dating
from 2010, 2012 and 2013. Altogether, the datasets consist of almost 30
billion RDF quads. The most recent of the datasets contains amongst
other data over 211 million product descriptions, 54 million reviews and
125 million postal addresses originating from thousands of websites. The
availability of the datasets lays the foundation for further research on integrating and cleansing the data as well as for exploring its utility within
different application contexts. As the dataset series covers four years, it
can also be used to analyze the evolution of the adoption of the markup
formats.

Keywords: Microdata, RDFa, Microformats, Dataset, Web Science.

Introduction

A large number of websites have started to use markup standards to annotate
information about products, reviews, blog posts, people, organizations, events,
and cooking recipes within their HTML pages. The most prevalent of these
standards are Microformats,1 which use style definitions to annotate HTML
text with terms from a fixed set of vocabularies; RDFa [1], which is used to
embed any kind of RDF data into HTML pages, and Microdata [7], a recent
format developed in the context of HTML5.

The embedded data is crawled together with the HTML pages by search
engines such as Google, Yahoo!, Yandex, and Bing, which use the data to enrich
search results and to display entity descriptions within their applications [6,3].
Since 2011, those four search engine companies have been collaborating on the

Schema.org initiative,2 which offers a single vocabulary for describing entities
that is understood by applications from all four companies [5]. So far, only
the big search engine companies had access to large quantities of Microdata,
RDFa, and Microformats data as they were the only ones possessing large web
crawls. However, the situation has changed with the advent of the Common
Crawl Foundation.3 Common Crawl is a non-profit foundation that crawls the
Web and regularly publishes the resulting web corpora for public usage.

We have extracted all Microdata, RDFa, and Microformats data from the
Common Crawl corpora gathered in 2010, 2012 and 2013 and provide the extracted data for public download. Table 1 gives an overview of the Common
Crawl corpora as well as the overall quantity of the extracted data. The second and third column show the number of HTML pages and pay-level domains
(PLDs) covered by the different crawls. The forth and fifth column contain the
percentages of all pages and PLDs that use at least one of the three markup
formats. Column six shows the overall number of RDF quads that we have extracted from each corpus, while column seven contains the compressed size of
the resulting datasets. The 2013 Common Crawl corpus, for instance, consists of
2.2 billion HTML pages originating from over 12 million PLDs. 26.33% of these
pages and 13.87% of the PLDs use at least one markup format, resulting in an
extracted dataset containing 17 billion RDF quads.

This paper is structured as follows: first, we give an overview of the Common
Crawl initiative and the web corpora that it provides to the public. Afterwards,
we explain the methodology that was used to extract the data from the corpora
and describe the data format that we use to offer the data for public download.
In order to give an impression of the content of the extracted data, we discuss
the distribution of the different markup formats within the 2013 dataset in Section 5. Afterwards, we analyze the topical domains as well as the richness of the
annotations in Section 6 for RDFa, Section 7 for Microdata, and Section 8 for
Microformats. In [2], we have presented a similar analysis of the 2012 dataset.
In order to illustrate the evolution of the adoption of the different formats, we
compare our findings from the 2012 and 2013 datasets wherever this reveals interesting trends. Section 9 discusses related work, while Section 10 concludes the
paper by discussing the challenges that need to be addressed for using the data
within applications.

2 The Common Crawl

Our dataset series was extracted from three web corpora published by the Common Crawl Foundation. The first corpus contains pages that have been crawled
between 2009 and 2010. The second corpus was gathered in the first half of 2012.
The crawler that was used to gather both corpora employed a breath-first selection strategy and was seeded with a large number of URLs from former crawls.
The seed URLs were ordered according to their PageRank. Since the end of 2012
the Common Crawl Foundation releases two crawls per year. Each crawl consists of around two billion pages. For the recent crawls the foundation uses seed
lists provided by the search engine company blekko.4 The new seed lists should
improve the quality of the crawl by avoiding webspam, porn and the influence
of excessive SEO [8]. In addition to using an external seed list, the Common
Crawl Foundation has also shifted their crawling infrastructure to a modified
version of Apache Nutch to gather the pages contained in the seed list instead of
using their own crawling framework.5 All Common Crawl corpora are provided
as (W)ARC files6 and are available as free download from Amazon S3.7

3 Methodology

In order to extract RDFa, Microdata, and Microformats data from the corpora,
we developed a parsing framework which can be executed on Amazon EC28 and
supports parallel processing of multiple (W)ARC files. The framework relies on
the Anything To Triples parser library (Any23)9 to extract Microdata, RDFa,
and Microformats data from the corpora. For processing the Common Crawl
corpora on Amazon EC2 we used 100 AWS EC2 c1.xlarge machines. Altogether,
extracting the HTML-embedded data from the 2013 corpus required a total
machine rental fee of US$ 263.06 using Amazon spot instances.10

We used Apache Pig11 running on Amazon Elastic MapReduce to calculate
most of the statistics presented in this paper as well as to generate the vector
representation used for the co-occurrence analysis.12 As the three crawls cover
different HTML pages and as the number of crawled pages per PLD differs

to the ARC file format  http://archive-access.sourceforge.net/warc/.

widely, we aggregate the data by PLD, especially for analyzing the deployment
of the different markup languages and comparing the deployment between the
different datasets. To determine the PLD of each page, we use the Public Suffix
List.13 Hence, a PLD not always equals a second-level domain, but countryspecific domains such as co.uk or mass hosting domains like blogspot.com are
considered as top-level domains in our analysis.

4 Dataset Format and Download

The extracted data is represented as RDF quads (encoded as N-Quads14), with
the forth element being used to represent the provenance of each triple. This
means in addition to subject, predicate, and object, each quad includes the
URL of the HTML page from which it was extracted. The extracted data is
provided for download in the various sub-datasets. Each sub-dataset includes the
information extracted for one markup language from one crawl, e.g. all quads
representing information embedded in web pages from the 2013 crawl using
Microdata form a sub-dataset. All datasets are provided for public download on
the Web Data Commons website.15 In addition to the datasets, the website also
provides detailed background data for the analysis presented in this paper, such
as the lists of all websites using specific formats or vocabulary terms.

5 Distribution by Format

Table 2 gives an overview of the distribution of the different markup formats
within the 2013 dataset. For each format, the table contains the number of PLDs
and the number of URLs using the format. For Microformats, the numbers are
reported separately for each sub-format. Column 5 and 6 contain the number of
quads and the compressed file size of the extracted datasets. The largest number of quads, namely 8.7 billion, were generated from Microdata annotations,
followed by the Microformat hcard with 4.9 billion and RDFa with over 2.6 billion quads. Regarding the number of websites annotating information using the
different markup languages, we find 995 thousand websites using hcard, followed
by 471 thousand using RDFa and 463 thousand using Microdata.

In order to give an impression about the number of entities that are described
in the data as well as the richness of the entity descriptions, we group all quads
that have the same subject URI into a record. Column four of Table 2 contains
the overall number of records contained in each dataset. We see, for instance,
that the Microdata dataset describes 1.9 billion entities. Each entity description
(record) consists of an average of 4.48 quads.

6 RDFa Data

The 2013 RDFa dataset includes data from over 471 thousand websites, which
are 26% of all websites containing structured data in the crawl. The largest
amount of RDF statements was extracted from tripadvisor.com with 78 million
quads, followed by yahoo.com with over 28 million quads and hotels.com with
more than 17 million quads.

Class/Property Frequency Distribution: The corpus contains over 646
thousand different classes and over 27 thousand different RDFa properties. Figure 1(a) shows the class and property distribution using a log-scale for the y-
axis, which reports the number of websites making use of a class or property.
The x-axis draws the classes and properties ordered descending by the number
of websites using them. Similar to our observations for the 2012 dataset [2], both
distributions are long-tailed and only a small number of classes and properties
are used by a large number of websites. Altogether, we find 949 classes and
2 069 properties that are used by at least two different websites. The majority of
the terms are only used by a single website. Manually inspecting some of these
terms reveals a large number of typos in spelling terms from more widely used
vocabularies. On the other hand, there exists also a large number of proprietary
vocabularies which are used only by a single website.

Frequent Classes: Table 3 lists the most frequently used RDFa classes ordered
by the number of websites deploying them. The table also includes the total
number of records of each class included in the 2013 dataset. For comparison,
we also state the total as well as the percental number of websites deploying
the classes in 2012.16 Table 3 shows that the Facebook ecosystem has a strong
presence in the most frequently used classes, i.e. nine out of 30 classes belong to
the Open Graph Protocol (OGP). Although the total number of websites using

16 The namespaces of the classes are abbreviated with the corresponding prefix from
the http://prefix.cc/list. Classes with an og-namespace prefix belong to the
OGP and are within the HTML pages not maintained with a namespace, but as
literals instead.

the classes og:article and og:website is smaller in the 2013 dataset than
in the 2012 dataset, the percental usage is higher. This is due to the smaller
number of PLDs covered in the 2013 crawl (see Table 1). Looking at the total
number of records of each class (column 3 in Table 3), we see that the dataset
contains 13 million og:product records, 15 million gd:Organization records, as
well as 22 million sioc:UserAccount records.

Facebook Data: In the following we will have a brief look at the OGP data
and state properties included in the dataset for the OGP classes. The OGP
is developed and promoted by Facebook in order to enable the integration of
external content into the social networking platform. In contrast to other RDFa
vocabularies, OGP allows the usage of literals instead of URIs to identify classes.
Table 4 shows the properties that are most frequently used together with the
top five OGP classes. Similar to our findings for the 2012 dataset [2], the top 15
most frequently used properties are rather generic, whereas there is a small shift
in the usage of namespaces as the ogm namespace is used more frequently.

7 Microdata

The 2013 Microdata dataset contains data from over 463 thousand different
websites, which are 26% of all websites containing structured data. Compared
to the 6.1% of all websites using Microdata in 2012 [2], the adoption has grown
by more than factor four in just one year. The largest amounts of Microdata
statements were extracted from citysearch.com with 797 million quads, ebay.com
with 153 million quads and hp.com with 65 million quads.

Class/Property Frequency Distribution: The dataset contains over 15 thousand different classes and over 170 thousand different properties that are used
by Microdata annotations. Figure 1(b) shows the class and property distribution
using a log-scale in the same manner as Figure 1(a). Altogether, the Microdata
dataset contains 1 200 classes and 12 506 properties that are used by at least two
different websites. Similar to the observations made for the RDFa deployment,
classes and properties in the long tail include large numbers of typos as well as
website-specific terms.

Frequent Classes: Table 5 shows the most frequently used Microdata classes
ordered by the number of PLDs deploying them. The second column shows the
absolute number of records of each class. The most popular classes belong to the
topical domains product data (Product, Offer, Review, Rating), blogs (Article,
Blog, BlogPosting), navigational information (Breadcrumb), people (Person),
organizations (LocalBusiness, Organization) and addresses (PostalAddress, Ad-
dress). Due to the growing adoption of Microdata, we discuss some of the major
topical domains of the data in more detail in the following.

Postal Addresses: The dataset contains 124 million schema:PostalAddress
records originating from over 52 thousand websites. On average each address
is described by 3.96 property values. Table 6(a) shows that more than 90% of the

records contain the properties schema:addressLocality and schema:addressRegion.
Table 7(a) shows the top ten websites ordered by number of address records that
we have extracted from the sites.

Local Business: The dataset contains over 76 million records of type schema:
LocalBusiness coming from 35 403 websites. On average schema:LocalBusiness
records contain 5.22 properties. As shown in Table 6(b), over 80% of all records
contain four out of the top five properties. This means, that for a large proportion of records we can expect information about the address of the busi-
ness, the name, as well as the URL. When comparing the websites using the
schema:LocalBusiness class (cf. Table 7(b)) with the ones using the class schema:
PostalAddress we see citysearch.com at the first position in both lists. The website is a local business search engine, providing information about companies
within different cities. A remarkable observation for local businesses is that more
than 6% of the records contain several values for the property name.

Product Data: The 2013 dataset contains 202 million product records originating from almost 71 thousand different websites. This makes product data the
second largest topical domain in the dataset. Table 7(c) shows the top ten PLDs
offering product data ordered by the number of records. Product descriptions are
markup with two different classes: schema:Product (80%) and dv:Product (20%).
On average each product is described by 4.56 properties. Table 6(c) shows that
the properties name, offers, and image are provided for almost 50% of all
product records. Only around 17% of the records contain a description prop-
erty. Only 15% of all records use of the property productId which might help
to identify product records from different websites that refer to the same prod-
uct. Petrovski et al. [12] have examined the content of product name properties
of electronic products. Their analysis shows that there is quite some variation
in the names that are used by different websites to refer to the same product
and that many e-shops include different product features for marketing reasons

into the product names. Both findings illustrate the difficulties that an application will need to face that tries to build an integrated product catalog based
on Microdata product records. Petrovski et al. approach this problem by first
extracting product features from the product names and descriptions and then
using these features for identity resolution, reaching an F1-measure of 82% [12].

Job Postings: As a result of a collaboration with the United States Office
of Science and Technology Policy, schema.org started to provide vocabulary
terms for describing job postings in the end of 2011 [4]. Our dataset contains
21 million records of class schema:JobPosting originating from over two thousand
websites. schema:JobPosting records contain, on average, 5.93 properties and the
class schema:JobPosting thus belongs to the classes with the highest average
number of properties used. Table 6(d) shows the most frequent properties of
schema:JobPosting records. 1% of the records contain more than one name
property value. Table 7(d) shows the top ten PLDs by record count providing
data for job postings.17

7.1 New Microdata Adopters

In the following, we will analyze the websites that newly adopted Microdata in
2013. We use the list of websites extracted by Meusel et al. [9] from the 2012 crawl
and calculate the overlap with the crawled websites in 2013. We then identify
every website which is included in the 2012 and 2013 crawl and has adopted
RDFa, Microdata, or Microformats in 2013 but did not adopt it in 2012. This
results in a list of 490 778 websites out of which 169 134 make use of Microdata.
Table 8 gives an overview of the classes that are used by at least 1% of new
adopters. Again, classes of the Schema.org vocabulary dominate, however despite
its deprecation in 2011 the data-vocabulary vocabulary is still being used by the
new adopters in 2013. Similar to the overall distribution of Microdata classes,
websites newly adopting Microdata cover a broad range of different topics with
a slight focus on product related data.

As an example, we calculated a co-occurrence matrix for classes and properties on websites newly adopting schema:Product and compare the co-occurring
properties with the analysis of all schema:Product websites from the 2013 and
2012 datasets. Table 9 shows the top 20 most co-occurring properties on websites newly adopting Microdata. The table also shows in column six and eight
the difference between the new adopters and the complete datasets from 2013
and 2012. Product records appearing on websites newly adopting Microdata are
more likely described by the top six properties than in the overall dataset of

8 Microformats Data

Microformats are used on approximately 1.1 million websites within the 2013
crawl. This makes Microformats the most widely adapted markup format being
used by over 62.7% of all sites using any markup languages.

Frequent Classes: Table 10 gives an overview of the most frequently used Microformats classes. The third column shows the absolute number of records of
a certain class in the 2013 dataset. Column four shows the absolute number of
PLDs from which the records originate. The last two columns show the percentage of PLDs making use of a certain Microformats classes in the 2013 and 2012
datasets. The most popular Microformat class is hcard:VCard. The dataset includes over 787 million records of this class originating from almost one million
different sites. The second most frequent used class is hCard:Organization. The
2013 dataset contains over 126 million records of this class. Both classes belong
to the hCard vocabulary. The second most frequently used Microformats vocabulary is geo with 75 million records of type geo:Location spread over 23 thousand
sites. Besides the over 37 million hCalendar:Vevents records and 19 million hRe-
view:Review records, the dataset also offers over one million recipes originating

from 3 530 different sites. The top PLDs from which the data originates are
epicurious.com, grouprecipes.com and chefkoch.de. Comparing the percentage of
PLDs using Microformats annotations between the 2012 and 2013 datasets, the
deployment of Microformats does not grow significantly but appears stable.

9 Related Work

In this section we review other public Microdata, RDFa, and Microformats
datasets and refer to related work analyzing the deployment of these standards.
The only other public large-scale source of Microdata, RDFa, and Microformats data  that we are aware of  is the Sindice search engine.18 Sindice
collects data from the Web and allows the data to be searched using keyword
as well as SPARQL queries. The Sindice index includes not only data gathered from HTML pages but also data extracted from WebAPIs as well as data
from the Linked Data Cloud. The data is mixed by Sindice within their index
which makes it difficult to get a pure HTML-extracted dataset. Also note that
Sindice only crawls HTML pages from websites that offer a site map. According to the latest Sindice statistics from September 2013, their corpus contains
3.36 million different classes for which they could find at least six records within
their data sources.19 The index includes around 700 million records of class
hCard:VCard, 68 million records of class hCard:Organization, 28 million records
of class og:article and over 10 million records of class schema:Product. Unfor-
tunately, according to recent Sindice blog posts, there are no plans to keep the
SPARQL endpoint alive as well as to update their large datasets.20 As Sindice
is restricted to websites offering sitemaps, it does not cover as many websites
as our datasets. On the other hand, Sindice covers websites in a more complete

fashion compared to our datasets which can only contain data from HTML pages
included in the Common Crawl.

The big search engine companies Google, Yahoo!, Microsoft and Yandex extract Microdata, RDFa, and Microformats data from their Web crawls but, for
economic reasons, do not provide public access to the resulting datasets. Although they have published a number of studies about the deployment of the
markup languages: Mika and Potter analyze the adoption of the languages based
on Web crawls from the Bing search engine dating from 2011 and 2012 [10,11].
Guha presented an updated analysis of the deployment of Microdata with a
special focus on the Schema.org vocabulary at the LDOW 2014 workshop [5].

10 Conclusion

This paper has presented a series of publicly accessible Microdata, RDFa, Microformats datasets that we have extracted from three large Web corpora dating
from 2010, 2012 and 2013. The extracted datasets show that all three markup
standards are used by hundreds of thousands of websites. Comparing the 2012
and 2013 datasets reveals that the number of websites using Microdata has grown
by more than factor four in just one year. Altogether, the extracted datasets
consist of almost 30 billion RDF quads and contain large quantities of prod-
uct, review, address, blog post, people, organization, event, and cooking recipe
data. As far as we know, the WebDataCommons datasets are the largest publicly
accessible datasets of this kind.

We believe that the data will be useful for various applications such as building
product catalogs, address databases or event and cooking websites. The data also

constitutes a valuable source of evaluation data for testing methods from various
research areas. For evaluation purposes, the amount of data contained in the
datasets should be large and representative enough. For commercial purposes,
it has to be kept in mind that the Common Crawl only contains a subset of
the pages from each website. Thus, the extracted datasets can also only contain
a subset of the Microdata, RDFa, Microformats annotations offered by each
website and should thus rather be used to identity seeds for more complete
directed crawls. Before Microdata, RDFa, Microformats data can be used in
application settings, several challenges need to be addressed:

Information Extraction: Most entities are only marked up with a relatively
small number of properties and these properties tend to be rather generic,
such as name or description properties, leading to rather flat records. It is
thus often necessary to apply further information extraction methods to the
property values in order to reach more fine grained data structures that
allow the application of more sophisticated data integration and cleansing
methods [12].

Identity Resolution: The data hardly contains entity identifiers, such as ISBN
EAN numbers, which would make it easy to identity records from different
websites that described the same entity. Instead, applications that want to
deduplicate data from multiple websites need to match the entity descriptions published by the sites. An example of how such an identity resolution
heuristic is applied to Microdata product records is given in [12].

Data Quality Assessment: As the Web is an open and unrestricted information environment, web data might be outdated or simply wrong. Thus, before
data is used in an application context its quality should be assessed based
on its content as well as its provenance. An interesting identity resolution

and data quality assessment challenge is for instance given by the Microdata address data: Which of the provided addresses is the current address
of a company? How to determine this address given that many yellow pages
websites copy from each other and simple voting thus does not work?

We believe that the adoption of the Microdata, RDFa, Microformats standards by hundreds of thousands of websites provides a huge potential for using
Web data within various applications. On the other hand, it also raises tough
challenges concerning the integration and cleansing of the data. By providing
the WebDataCommons dataset series, we hope to contribute to addressing these
challenges and to lift the potential of the data.

was in part supported by the FP7-ICT projects PlanetData (GA 247641), and
LOD2 (GA 257943) and by an Amazon Web Services in Education Grant award.
We would like to thank the Common Crawl foundation for publishing the web
crawls. We also thank the Any23 team for their great parsing framework as well
as Hannes M uhleisen for his initial work on the Web Data Commons extraction
framework.
