Abstract. The Atomic Decomposition of an ontology is a succinct representation of the logic-based modules in that ontology. Ultimately, it reveals the modular structure of the ontology. Atomic Decompositions appear to be useful for
both user and non-user facing services. For example, they can be used for ontology comprehension and to facilitate reasoner optimisation. In this article we
investigate claims about the practicality of computing Atomic Decompositions
for naturally occurring ontologies. We do this by performing a replication study
using an off-the-shelf Atomic Decomposition algorithm implementation on three
large test corpora of OWL ontologies. Our findings indicate that (a) previously
published empirical studies in this area are repeatable and verifiable; (b) computing Atomic Decompositions in the vast majority of cases is practical in that it can
be performed in less than 30 seconds in 90% of cases, even for ontologies containing hundreds of thousands of axioms; (c) there are occurrences of extremely
large ontologies (< 1% in our test corpora) where the polynomial runtime behaviour of the Atomic Decomposition algorithm begins to bite and computations
cannot be completed within 12-hours of CPU time; (d) the distribution of number
of atoms in the Atomic Decomposition for an ontology appears to be similar for
distinct corpora.

Keywords: OWL, Ontologies, Atomic Decomposition.

1 Introduction

The Atomic Decomposition of an ontology is essentially a succinct representation of
the modular structure of that ontology. In this article we present an empirical study on
the Atomic Decomposition of ontologies. We begin by introducing modularity in the
context of ontologies and then move on to discuss the notion of Atomic Decomposi-
tion. We then present a replication study that we have performed, which thoroughly
examines the performance of existing software and techniques for computing Atomic
Decompositions.

Ontology Modularity. In recent years the topic of ontology modularity has gained a
lot of attention from researchers in the OWL community. In the most general sense, a
module of an ontologyO is a subset of O that has some desirable (non-trivial) properties
and is useful for some particular purpose. For example, given a biomedical ontology

about anatomy one might extract a module for the class Heart. This module preserves
all information about Heart from the original ontology and can therefore be used in
place of the original ontology when a description of Heart is needed. In this case, the
module that describes Heart is hopefully much smaller than the size of the original
ontology, which makes reusing the description of Heart much easier (in terms of file
size, editing and reasoning) than if it were necessary to import and reuse the original
ontology in its entirety. For large biomedical ontologies, the difference in size between
a module for a term and the size of ontology that the module was extracted from can
be very large. For example, Suntisrivaraporn [7] determined that the average size of a
module in SNOMED was around 30 axioms compared to the size of the ontology which
is over 300,000 axioms. A key desirable property about the kinds of modules discussed
here is that given a module M of an ontology O, the entities in M are described exactly
as they are in O, and from the point of view of these entities, M is indistinguishable
from O.

From Modules to the Modular Structure of an Ontology. Although the above scenario
of ontology reuse was the main driving force for the development of proper modularity
definitions and practical module extraction techniques, modules have also been used for
other purposes such as ontology comprehension. Here, the basic idea is that an ontology
can be split up into modules that capture the different topics that are described by the
complete ontology. Moreover, a dependency relation between topics specifies how they
link together, and for a given topic, which other topics it depends upon. For example,
in a medical ontology the topic (module) diseases of the heart may depend upon the
topic hearts, which may depend upon the topic organs. Figure 1, taken from [10],
shows how this idea could be used in a tool.1 The circles in the diagram represent the
various topics in the Koala ontology2 with the lines between the circles representing
the logical dependencies between these topics. For example, the topic Animal depends
upon the topics Gender, Habitat and Degree. Each topic contains axioms that describe

1 In this particular case, the modules are -connection modules, and the diagram has been pro-

duced by the ontology editor Swoop.

entities pertaining to that topic. It is easy to imagine that such a representation would
be useful for getting an overview of, and browsing, an ontology.

As far as the latest modularisation techniques for OWL ontologies are concerned
(efficient syntactic-locality-based techniques) there can be an exponential number of
modules for any given ontology with respect to the size of the ontology. However, not
all modules are necessarily interesting. This gives rise to the notion of genuine modules.
A genuine module is essentially a module that is not made up of the union (disjoint
union or otherwise) of two or more other modules. Genuine modules are of interest
because they can be used to generate a topicality-based structuring of an ontology.

In terms of computing genuine modules, a straight forward algorithm for obtaining
the set of genuine modules for an ontology is to compute all of the modules for the
ontology and then to compare them with each other in order to eliminate non-genuine
modules. However, since there can be an exponential number of modules for any given
ontology this is, in general, not feasible. Fortunately, it is possible to efficiently compute
the Atomic Decomposition of an ontology as a succinct representation3 of the modules
in that ontology. Ultimately, an Atomic Decomposition can be used to generate structures similar to the structure shown in Figure 1. Moreover, it is possible to generate
these succinct representations in a runtime that is polynomial (actually quadratic) with
respect to the size of the input ontology.
Atomic Decomposition. In short, the Atomic Decomposition of an ontology O is a pair
consisting of a set of atoms of O and a directed dependency relation over these atoms
[10]. An atom is a maximal set of axioms (statements from O) which are tightly bound
to each other. That is, for a given module M in O, either all of the axioms in an atom
belong to M or else none of them belong to M. More precisely,
Definition 1 (Atom). let O be an ontology. A non-empty set of axioms S  O is an
atom in O if for any module M  O, it is the case that (a) either S  M, or, S M =
; and (b) S is maximal, i.e. there is no S
For the notions of modules considered in this article, which are depleting modules, the
set of atoms for an ontology O is uniquely determined, it partitions O, and is called an
atomic decomposition of O.

strict superset of S that satisfies (a).

Besides being used for end user facing tasks such as ontology comprehension, the
technique of Atomic Decomposition can also be used in non-user facing services as
an optimisation technique. For example, Klinov and colleagues use Atomic Decomposition based techniques for the offline computation of modules, in order to reduce
memory requirements and speed up reasoning in Web services [11]. Similarly, Tsarkov
et al use Atomic Decomposition based techniques for optimising reasoning in their
CHAINSAW reasoner [9].

In terms of using Atomic Decomposition in 3rd party tools, there are off-the-shelf
implementations of algorithms for computing the Atomic Decomposition of an ontol-
ogy. These algorithms have been designed and implemented by Del Vescovo and colleagues [10], and further optimised by Tsarkov [8]. Assuming that the modularisation

3 In this case succinct representation means a non-exponential representation that is linear in the

size of the ontology.

M. Horridge et al.

sub-routines used by the algorithm have polynomial runtime behaviour (which is the
case for the most widely used modularisation algorithms), the worst case complexity
of these Atomic Decomposition algorithms is polynomial-time in the size of the input
ontology.

Despite the fact that a polynomial-time algorithm is considered to be an efficient
procedure, Del Vescovo points out that if a single invocation of the modularisation subroutine takes 1 ms to perform, then it would take ten years to compute the Atomic
Decomposition for an ontology the size of SNOMED (300,000 axioms in size). How-
ever, Del Vescovo performed a series of experiments on a restricted subset of the BioPortal [6] corpus of ontologies and her results indicate that, in practice, the algorithm
performs well and is useable in tools.

Aims and Objectives. Given the potential of Atomic Decomposition techniques for use
in both user-facing and non-user-facing tools, in this article we aim to check the claims
of the practicality of the optimised algorithm for computing Atomic Decompositions.
Del Vescovos original experiments were performed on a subset of 253 ontologies from
the NCBO BioPortal repository. Amongst various filtering criteria, Del Vescovo excluded ontologies from the experiment that were greater than 20,000 axioms in size.
Clearly, this leaves some room for verification. We therefore replicate Del Vescovos ex-
periments, showing that they are repeatable, and we verify the claims made by extending the experiments using a current, and complete, snapshot of the BioPortal corpus.
We also bolster our results with a much larger corpus of 4327 ontologies that includes
non-biomedical ontologiesspecifically, we use the Semantic Web corpus described
by Matentzoglu and colleagues at ISWC 2013 in A Snapshot of the OWL Web [4].

We make the following contributions:

 We replicate Del Vescovos Atomic Decomposition experiments. We show that they
are repeatable and we verify the runtime performance results on the exact corpus
used by Del Vescovo.

 We use the same methodology and software to extend the experiments on the complete BioPortal corpus. This includes ontologies that are an order of magnitude
larger than the paired down corpus used by Del Vescovo. We do this to investigate
the claims that the techniques are practical.

 We carry out another round of experiments on a third corpus of 4327 ontologies
obtained from a Web-crawl. As well as being larger than the BioPortal corpus, this
Web-crawl corpus contains non-biomedical ontologies, which may reflect different styles of modelling. We examine both the runtime performance of the Atomic
Decomposition algorithm and also the number of atoms per ontology, comparing
these result to the results from Del Vescovos corpus.

 We discuss how the nature of the ontologies affects the results of the second and

third experiments and make some recommendations for future work.

2 Preliminaries

In the work presented here, we deal with a corpus of ontologies written in the Web Ontology Language (OWL), and more specifically OWL 2, its latest version [5]. Through-
?

?

?
out the rest of this article we refer to OWL 2 simply as OWL. In this section, we present
the main OWL terminology that is useful in the context of this article. We assume that
the reader has basic familiarity with ontologies and OWL.

OWL: Entities, Class Expressions, Axioms and Ontologies. An OWL ontology is a
set of axioms. Each axiom makes a statement about the domain of interest. The building
blocks of axioms are entities and class expressions. Entities correspond to the important terms in the domain of interest and include classes, properties, individuals, and
datatypes. The signature of an ontology is the set of entities that appear in that ontol-
ogy. OWL is a highly expressive language and features a rich set of class constructors
that allow entities to be combined into more complex class expressions. As a conven-
tion, we use the letters A and B to stand for class names and the letters C and D to
stand for (possibly complex) class expressions. We also use the word term (or terms) as
a synonym for entity (entities).

Syntactic-Locality-Based Modularity. The most widely implemented form of modularity in available tools, and the type of modularity used by Del Vescovo and thus in the
experiments in this article, is syntactic-locality-based modularity. Given an ontology O
and a signature  which is a subset of the signature of O, a syntactic-locality-based
module M = Module(O, )  O can be extracted from O for  by inspecting the
syntax of axioms in O. Syntactic-locality-based-modules have the desirable property
that given an entailment  expressed using terms from , M behaves exactly the same
as O. That is, M entails  if and only if O entails . Given O and , it is possible to
extract three three main types, or notions, of syntactic-locality-based modules: the -
module (pronounced bottom module), the -module (pronounced top module) and
the -module (pronounced star module). To take a very rough, over-simplistic
view, a -module includes axioms that define relationships between terms in  and
more general terms in O, a -module includes axioms that define relationships between terms in  and more specific terms in O, and a -module includes axioms
that define and preserve relationships between terms in .
Atomic Decomposition. An atomic decomposition of an ontologyOis a pair (A(O),),
where A(O) is the set of atoms induced by the genuine modules of O, and  is a partial
order (dependency relation) between the atoms. An atom is a set of axioms (fromO) all of
which, for a given  and corresponding genuine module M, are either contained within
M or are not contained within M. An atomic decomposition can be computed within
a period of time that is polynomial with respect to the size of the ontology. For a given
ontology O and each notion of syntactic-locality it is possible to compute an Atomic
Decomposition of O. This gives us a  Atomic Decomposition (or -AD for short), a
 Atomic Decomposition (or -AD for short), and a  Atomic Decomposition (or
-AD for short). The -AD highlights dependencies of more specific atoms on more
general atoms, the -AD highlights the dependencies of more general atoms on more
specific atoms, and the -AD highlights differences between atoms.

Class Expression, Axiom and Ontology Length. In line with the reporting of results
in Del Vescovos work [10], we use the notion of the length of an ontology to report

M. Horridge et al.

the results in this article. In essence the length of an ontology is the number of steps
required to parse the symbols in an ontology and reflects the number of operations
required to compute a module for some signature. For example, the length of C  D
is the length of C plus the length of D. The length of C  D is the length of C plus
the length of D. The length of the class name A is 1. The length of an ontology O is
the sum of the lengths of the axioms in O. For the sake of brevity we do not give a
complete definition of length here. Instead we stick with the intuitive meaning and refer
the reader to page 23 of Del Vescovos thesis [10] for a complete definition.

3 Previous Studies on Atomic Decomposition

The most comprehensive study on Atomic Decomposition to date is presented in Del
Vescovo 2013 [10]. In this work, Del Vescovo describes a series of experiments on 253
ontologies that were taken from a November 2012 snapshot of the NCBO BioPortal
repository [6]. For each ontology Del Vescovo investigated the time to compute the on-
tologys -AD, -AD, and -AD and she also explored the makeup of the structure
of each Atomic Decomposition.
The expressivity of ontologies contained in Del Vescovos corpus, ranges from
lightweight EL [1] (OWL2EL) and AL (56 ontologies), through SHIF (OWL-Lite, 51
ontologies) to SHOIN [3] (OWL-DL, 36 ontologies) and SROIQ [2] (OWL2DL, 47
ontologies). While this corpus does not contain ontologies that could not be downloaded
or parsed from BioPortal, for obvious reasons, it also excludes BioPortal ontologies that
are either (a) inconsistent or, (b) that are greater than 20,000 axioms in size.

Given that Del Vescovos experiments are limited to a single filtered corpus, which
has itself evolved since 2013, a replication study, which uses both the current BioPortal
corpus and other ontology corpora, would be useful in order verify her results and help
reduce threats to the external validity of her experiments. In what follows we therefore
repeat and extend her experiments using three different corpora of ontologies.

4 Ontology Corpora

In our replication experiments which follow we use three different ontology corpora.
The first, is the exact corpus used by Del Vescovo. We refer to this as the DEL-VESCOVO
corpus. The second and third corpora, which contain much larger ontologies than the
DEL-VESCOVO corpus, are made up from all parseable OWL (and OWL compatible
syntaxes such as OBO) ontologies from the BioPortal ontology repository [6], and ontologies from a Web-crawl. We refer to these as the BIOPORTAL corpus and the WEBCRAWL corpus respectively. BioPortal is a community-based repository of biomedical
ontologies [6]4, which at the time of writing contains more than 360 biomedical ontologies written in various languages.

We now describe the three corpora in more detail. All three corpora, along with

summary descriptions for each (sizes, expressivities etc.), may be found on-line.5

The DEL-VESCOVO Corpus (242 Ontologies)

The corpus used by Del Vescovo is described in detail in Del Vescovo 2012 [10]. It
contains a handful of ontologies that are well known ontologies in the area of modularontologies research, namely Galen, Koala, Mereology, MiniTambis, OWL-S, People,
TambisFull, and University. It also contains a subset (234 ontologies) of the ontologies
from a November 2012 snapshot of the NCBO BioPortal repository. Del Vescovo graciously provided us with the exact set of ontologies used in her experiment. For each
ontology in the corpus, its imports closure was provided to us merged into a single
OWL/XML ontology document.

The BIOPORTAL Corpus (249 Ontologies)

Since the DEL-VESCOVO corpus contains a subset of the ontologies from BioPortal,
and in particular does not contain ontologies whose sizes are greater than 20,000 ax-
ioms, we decided to construct a corpus based on all of the downloadable, and parseable,
OWL and OBO ontologies contained in BioPortal. The corpus was constructed as fol-
lows: We accessed BioPortal on the 5th of May 2014 using the NCBO Web services
API. We downloaded all OWL compatible (OWL plus OBO) ontology documents. For
each document in the corpus we parsed it using the OWL API version 3.5.0, merged the
imports closure and then saved the merged imports closure into a single ontology docu-
ment. We silently ignored missing imports and discarded any ontologies that would not
parse. The total number of (root) ontology documents that could be parsed along with
their imports closures was 249.

The WEB-CRAWL Corpus (4327 Ontologies)

The WEB-CRAWL corpus is based on a corpus obtained by crawling the Web for ontologies and is described by Matentzoglu in the ISWC 2013 article, A Snapshot of the
OWL Web [4]. This is a large and diverse corpus containing ontologies from many
different domains (including biomedicine). A raw version of the corpus was supplied
to us by Matentzoglu as a zip file containing the exact collection of RDF ontology documents that were obtained by the Web-crawl. For each document in this collection, we
parsed it using the OWL API version 3.5.0, merged its imports closure and then saved
the merged imports closure into a single ontology document. We silently ignored missing imports and discarded any ontologies that would not parse.6 The total number of
(root) ontology documents that could be parsed along with their imports closures was
4327.

Corpora Summary

Table 1 shows ontology sizes (number of logical axioms) and lengths for the three
corpora. Looking at the 90th and 99th percentiles, and also the max values of the BIOPORTAL corpus, and comparing these to those of the DEL-VESCOVO corpus, it is clear

to see that the BIOPORTAL corpus includes much larger ontologies, both in terms of
size (an order of magnitude larger) and length (two orders of magnitude larger). Sim-
ilarly, the WEB-CRAWL corpus is distinctively different in terms of size. It contains a
lot of small and mid-sized ontologies (75% being 576 axioms or less), and a also some
extremely large ontologies. For example, the largest ontology in the WEB-CRAWL corpus contains 740,559 axioms (it has a length of 2,720,146), which is two orders of
magnitude larger than the largest ontology in the DEL-VESCOVO corpus.

5 Materials and Methods

Apparatus

All experiments were performed using Ubuntu GNU/Linux machines running 24-core
2.1 GHz AMD Opteron (6172) processors. The machines were running Java version
1.7.0_25 OpenJDK Runtime Environment (IcedTea 2.3.10).

Algorithm Implementation

For computing Atomic Decompositions we used the off-the-shelf implementation provided by Del Vescovo and Palmisano. The implementation is available via Maven Central (maven.org) with an artifactId of owlapitools-atomicdecomposition. We
used version 1.1.1 dated 23-Jan-2014. For parsing and loading ontologies we used the
OWL API version 3.5.0also available via Maven Central.

Procedure
The algorithm implementation described above was used to compute the -AD, -AD
and -AD of each ontology in each of the three corpora (DEL-VESCOVO, BIOPORTAL , WEB-CRAWL). Each Atomic Decomposition was run as a separate process with 8

?
Gigabytes of RAM set as the maximum available memory for the Java Virtual Machine
(-Xmx8G).7 A timeout of 12 hours was imposed for each kind of Atomic Decomposition on each ontology. The CPU-time required for each Atomic Decomposition was
measured using the JavaThreadMX framework. Finally, for each Atomic Decomposi-
tion, the number atoms and the sizes of each atom were recorded.

6 Results

In what follows we present the main results that we obtained in this replication study.
An analysis and interpretation of the results takes place in Section 7.

The times for computing each type of Atomic Decomposition are shown in Figures 27. To make comparison with Del Vescovos work easier the results for the DELVESCOVO corpus have been repeated throughout the figures. Figures 2, 3 and 4 show
CPU-times for the Atomic Decompositions of the DEL-VESCOVO corpus versus the
BIOPORTAL corpus for -AD, -AD and -AD respectively. Figures 5, 6 and 7
show CPU-times for the Atomic Decompositions of the DEL-VESCOVO corpus versus
the WEB-CRAWL corpus for -AD, -AD and -AD respectively. For each Figure,
the x-axis plots the length of the ontology and the y-axis plots the time in milliseconds
(ms) for the associated computation. It should be noted that the axes in all plots are
logarithmic.

Summaries of CPU-times for each corpus are described below and presented in Tables 2, 3 and 5. Due to the large spread of times, some of the summaries that we present
include percentile times (for the 90th, 95th and 99th percentiles). The time for the nth
percentile represents the maximum time taken for n percent of ontologies in the relevant
corpus. For example, the 95th percentile time for -AD in the DEL-VESCOVO corpus
(shown in Table 2) is 23,366ms. This means that 95 percent of ontologies in this corpus
can be decomposed in 23,366ms or less.

The DEL-VESCOVO corpus All computations finished within the 12 hour time-out
window. A summary of the CPU-time required to compute Atomic Decomposition over
the corpus is shown in Table 2. All times are shown in milliseconds.

The BIOPORTAL Corpus Within this corpus 240 ontologies completed within the
12 hour timeout period. A summary of the CPU-time required to compute Atomic Decomposition over the corpus is shown in Table 3. All times are shown in milliseconds.
There were 9 timeouts, with the ontologies that timed out being very large in size. Table
4 shows these ontologies, along with their sizes and lengths. Although these ontologies
timed out, we note that there are other very large ontologies that do not time out. For
example, three such ontologies are: one with 433,896 axioms and a length of 1,209,554;
one with 356,657 axioms and a length of 891,619; and one with 227,101 axioms and a
length of 726,421.

The WEB-CRAWL Corpus Within the WEB-CRAWL corpus Atomic Decompositions for 4,321 ontologies were completed within the timeout period. The Mean, Standard Deviation (StdDev), Median, 90th percentile, 95th percentile, 99th percentile and

7 We chose 8 Gigabytes of RAM as this was the limit used in Del Vescovos original work. We
acknowledge that that there are other differences in the hardware used, but where possible we
used the same parameters, for example, max available RAM.

Fig. 8. Number of axioms vs number of atoms for the WEB-CRAWL corpus. Each point on the
plot represents one ontology. The diagonal line represents a one-to-one correspondence between
axioms and atoms, where each dot on this line is an atom containing exactly one axiom.

the Maximum (Max) CPU-time required to compute Atomic Decompositions over the
corpus is shown in Table 5. All times are shown in milliseconds. There were 12 ontologies for which timeouts occurred in one form or another. Table 6 shows the failures and
where they occurred.

7 Analysis

In what follows we analyse the repeatability of Del Vescovos work and also make some
observations on the verifiability of the results in relation to the fresh ontology corpora
that we used.

Are the Experiments Published in Del Vescovos Work Repeatable? We were able
to obtain Del Vescovos input dataset, the software that she used and we were able to
replicate the experiments. Further more, when we replicated the experiments on the
DEL-VESCOVO corpus, all of the algorithms terminated on all inputs and, while we
do not include an exact comparison of times due to hardware setup differences, our

times were in the same order of magnitude as the times computed by Del Vescovo.
Figures 2(a) - 7(a) exhibit the same data spread as Figures 4.7, 4.8 and 4.9 in Del
Vescovos presentation of the results [10]. Del Vescovo observed that, over her complete
corpus, times for computing -ADs are generally larger than those for computing -
ADs. We also observed this aspect (Table 2), mainly for larger ontologies in the corpus.
Overall, we therefore consider Del Vescovos results to be repeatable. Moreover, we
consider our results on the DEL-VESCOVO corpus to be a reliable proxy for her results.

What Are the Main Similarities and Differences That Can Be Observed between
the DEL-VESCOVO Corpus the Other Two Corpora? The first thing to note are
significant differences in the makeup of the DEL-VESCOVO corpus and our corpora.
Both the BIOPORTAL corpus and the WEB-CRAWL corpus contain ontologies that are
smaller and also ontologies that are (one or two orders of magnitude) larger than the
ontologies found in the DEL-VESCOVO corpus (see Table 1). For some of the largest
ontologies, certain types of Atomic Decompositions could not be computed within 12
hours (Table 4 and Table 6). Having said this, there are equally large ontologies for
which it is possible to compute the Atomic Decompositions. Looking at these Figures
2(a) - 7(a) and comparing these with the corresponding 2(b) - 7(b) the distributions
of points on the plots over the same length scales are obviously similar. For smaller
ontology lengths and larger ontology lengths, the plots highlight the polynomial trend
in computation time. For the largest ontologies, which have lengths in excess of 500,000
and up to 1,000,000, it is noticeable that the computation time strays above one hour
(3,600,000ms). Ontologies of this size were not present in Del Vescovos sample and
these results begin to give some idea of what is possible with, and the boundaries of,

the current implementation. Obviously, whether or not these times are practical depends
entirely upon the application in question.

Why Do Several Ontologies in the BIOPORTAL Corpus and the WEB-CRAWL
Corpus Have Timeouts? The primary cause is the size of the ontology and the size
of modules in these ontologies. On closer inspection we found that nearly all of these
ontologies have extremely large ABoxes. Browsing through them in Protege also revealed that these ABoxes are largely used for annotation purposes as their individualsignatures were puns of class names which participated in labelling property assertions
(such as skos:notation, or name, where these properties are data properties rather than
annotation properties). Ignoring these ABox assertions, which are essentially annota-
tions, would bring many of the ontology lengths into the bounds whereby the Atomic
Decompositons could be computed.

How Does the Number of Atoms Vary between the Different Corpora? Figure 8
shows how the number of atoms per ontology vary over the DEL-VESCOVO corpus and
the WEB-CRAWL corpus.8 The main thing to note is that variation over each corpus is
similar for the different notions of Atomic Decomposition. For example, it is easy to see
that the number of atoms in a -AD tend to be fewer and larger when compared to the
8 For the sake of brevity we only compare these two corpora. The results are similar for the

DEL-VESCOVO corpus and the BIOPORTAL corpus.

-AD and -AD.9 The other thing to note is that the majority of -AD and -AD
atoms are fine-grained. This phenomena is manifested as the points clustering around
the diagonals in the plots for these types of decompositions. In this sense, ontologies
in the WEB-CRAWL corpus exhibit similar modular structures to the ontologies in the
DEL-VESCOVO corpus.

What Is the Practical Implication of These Results? The algorithm for computing
Atomic Decompositions has a theoretical worst-case complexity of polynomial runtime
behaviour. The polynomial runtime over all corpora is evident from looking at the plots
of CPU-time vs ontology length. For the vast majority of ontologies, Del Vescovos
observation, that computing the Atomic Decompositions for naturally occurring ontologies is practical holdsover all corpora the Atomic Decompositions for 90% of
ontologies could be computes in less than 30 seconds. For the handful of extremely
large ontologies, the polynomial runtime behaviour of the algorithm begins to bite and
there a small number of these ontologies for which it is not possible to compute the
Atomic Decomposition within what one might regard as a reasonable time frame. For
balance, we note that there are huge ontologies for which it is possible to compute the
Atomic Decompositions including ontologies of sizes 433,896 axioms, 356,657 axioms
and 227,101 axioms.

8 Conclusions

In this article we performed a replication study using an off-the-shelf Atomic Decomposition algorithm on three large test corpora of OWL ontologies. The main aim of this
work was to replicate and verify previously published results. Our findings indicate that

9 Recall that atoms are disjoint with each other and the complete set of atoms for an ontology

covers that ontology.

M. Horridge et al.

(a) the previously published empirical studies in this area are repeatable; (b) computing Atomic Decompositions in the vast majority of cases is practical, in that they can
be computed in less than 30 seconds in 90% of cases, even for ontologies containing
hundreds of thousands of axioms; (c) there are occurrences of extremely large ontologies (< 1% in our test corpora) where the polynomial runtime behaviour of the Atomic
Decomposition algorithm begins to bite, and computations cannot be completed within
12-hours of CPU time; (d) the distribution of number of atoms in the Atomic Decomposition for an ontology appears to be similar for distinct corpora. Finally, the ontology cor-
pora, summary metrics for the corpora, experiment results and software used to run the
experiments are available online at http://www.stanford.edu/ horridge/
publications/2014/iswc/atomic-decomposition/data.
