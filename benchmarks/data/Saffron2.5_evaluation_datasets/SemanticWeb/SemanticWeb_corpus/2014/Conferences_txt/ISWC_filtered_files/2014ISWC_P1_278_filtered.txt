Abstract. The central idea of Linked Data is that data publishers support applications in discovering and integrating data by complying to a
set of best practices in the areas of linking, vocabulary usage, and metadata provision. In 2011, the State of the LOD Cloud report analyzed the
adoption of these best practices by linked datasets within different topical domains. The report was based on information that was provided by
the dataset publishers themselves via the datahub.io Linked Data cata-
log. In this paper, we revisit and update the findings of the 2011 State of
the LOD Cloud report based on a crawl of the Web of Linked Data conducted in April 2014. We analyze how the adoption of the different best
practices has changed and present an overview of the linkage relationships between datasets in the form of an updated LOD cloud diagram,
this time not based on information from dataset providers, but on data
that can actually be retrieved by a Linked Data crawler. Among others,
we find that the number of linked datasets has approximately doubled
between 2011 and 2014, that there is increased agreement on common
vocabularies for describing certain types of entities, and that provenance
and license metadata is still rarely provided by the data sources.

Keywords: Linked Open Data, Web of Linked Data, Best Practices.

Introduction

The Web of Linked Data [3,7] has grown from a dozen datasets in 2007 into
a large data space containing hundreds of datasets today. In order to enable
Linked Data applications to discover datasets as well as to ease the integration
of data from multiple sources, Linked Data publishers should comply with a set
of best practices [4]. These best practices can be grouped into three areas:

Linking: By setting RDF links, data providers connect their datasets into a
single global data graph which can be navigated by applications and enables the
discovery of additional data by following RDF links.

Vocabulary Usage: The best practices advise publishers to use terms from
widely-used vocabularies in order to ease the interpretation of their data. If data
providers use their own vocabularies, the terms of such proprietary vocabularies

should be dereferencable into their RDF schema or OWL definitions. The definitions of proprietary vocabulary terms should contain RDF links pointing at
terms from widely-used vocabularies in order to ease their interpretation.

Metadata Provision: Linked Data should be as self-descriptive as possible, and
thus include metadata. An important form of metadata is provenance metadata
describing the origin of datasets and enabling applications to assess their quality.
The best practices also advise to provide licensing metadata and dataset-level
metadata, e.g., in the form of a VoID file1. If datasets are accessible via additional
access methods, such as a SPARQL endpoint or data dumps, then the VoID file
should contain information about these access methods.

The adoption of the Linked Data best practices by datasets belonging to
different topical domains was analyzed in the State of the LOD Cloud report [7]
in 2011. The report is based on information provided by the data publishers
themselves via the datahub.io Linked Data catalog2. In this paper, we revisit
and update the findings of the State of the LOD Cloud report from 2011 based
on a crawl of the Web of Linked Data conducted in April 2014. The paper is
structured as follows: Section 2 describes the crawling strategy that was used
to gather the data that forms the basis of our analysis. Section 3 explains the
categorization of the data by topical domain. Sections 4, 5, and 6 discuss the
adoption of best practices in the areas of linking, vocabulary usage, and metadata
provision. Section 7 gives an overview of related work. The paper closes with a
wrap-up of our findings.

2 Crawl of the Linked Data Web

To evaluate the conformance to the best practices, we have crawled a snapshot
of the Linked Data Web. For this, we used LDSpider, a framework for crawling
Linked Data [6]. We seeded LDSpider with 560 thousand seed URIs originating
from three sources: 1. We included all URIs of example resources from datasets
contained in the lod-cloud group in the datahub.io dataset catalog as well as
example URIs from other datasets in the catalog marked with Linked Data
related tags; 2. We included a sample of the URIs contained in the Billion Triple
Challenge 2012 dataset3; 3. We collected URIs from datasets advertised on the
public-lod@w3.org mailing list since 2011. With those seeds, we performed
crawls during April 2014 to retrieve entities from every dataset using a breadthfirst crawling strategy. Altogether, we crawled 900,129 documents describing
8,038,396 resources. The crawled data is provided for download on the website
accompanying this paper4 so that all results presented in the following can be
verified.

For grouping the retrieved resources into datasets, we generally assume that
all data originating from one pay-level domain (PLD) belongs to a single dataset.

If the datahub.io catalog lists multiple datasets for a single PLD, we apply an
exception to the general rule and use the dataset definitions from the catalog.
Altogether, the crawled data belongs to 1014 different datasets. Figure 1 shows
the distribution of the number of resources and documents per dataset contained
in the crawl.

Our crawler did respect crawling restrictions expressed by the data sources
via robots.txt files. Altogether, we discovered 77 linked datasets which do not
allow crawling and did not retrieve data from these sources.

3 Categorization by Topical Domain

Since the adoption of the Linked Data best practices might vary depending
on the topical domain of the datasets, we classify the datasets into the following topical categories: media, government, publications, life sciences, geographic,
cross-domain, user-generated content, and social networking. This categorization
schema is the same as the one used by the 2011 State of the LOD Cloud report
with the only difference that we added the category social networking as we discovered a large number of datasets providing data about people and their social
ties. For datasets that are contained in the datahub.io dataset catalog, we adopt
the topical categorization form the catalog. We manually assigned categories to
the newly discovered datasets after inspecting them. In the following, we define
the categories and refer to some prominent datasets from each category. After-
wards, we compare the overall number of datasets per category with the findings
of the 2011 State of the LOD Cloud report.

The media category contains datasets providing information about films, mu-
sic, TV and radio programmes, as well as print media. Prominent datasets
within this category are the dbtune.org music datasets, the New York Times
dataset, and the BBC radio and television program datasets. The government
category contains Linked Data published by federal or local governments, including a lot of statistical datasets. Prominent examples include the data.gov.uk
and opendatacommunities.org datasets. The category publications holds library datasets, information about scientific publications and conferences, reading

lists from universities, and citation databases. Well known datasets include
the German National Library dataset, the L3S DBLP dataset, and the Open Library dataset. The category geographic contains datasets like geonames.org and
linkedgeodata.org comprising information about geographic entities, geopolitical divisions, and points of interest. The life sciences category comprises biological and biochemical information, drug-related data, and information about
species and their habitats. The cross-domain category includes general knowledge bases such as DBpedia or UMBEL, linguistic resources such as WordNet
or Lexvo, as well as product data. The the category user-generated
content contains data from portals that collect content generated by larger user
communities. Examples include metadata about blogposts published as Linked
Data by wordpress.com, data about open source software projects published by
apache.org, scientific workflows published by myexperiment.org, and reviews
published by goodreads.com or revyu.com. The category social networking contains people profiles as well as data describing the social ties amongst people.
We include into this category individual FOAF profiles, as well as data about
the interconnections amongst users of the distributed microblogging platform
StatusNet. The distinction between the categories user-generated content and
social networking is that the datasets in the former category focus on the actual
content while datasets in the later focus on user profiles and social ties. The 2011
State of the LOD Cloud report did not contain social networking as a separate
category since the report did not count individual FOAF profiles as separate
datasets and since StatusNet servers did not export Linked Data in 2011.

Table 1 gives an overview of the number of datasets in each category as well
as the growth per category compared to the 2011 report. A list with the exact
assignments of each dataset to a category is found on the accompanying website.
The numbers in brackets in the second column refer to the number of datasets
that do not allow crawling. The by far largest category is social networking with
520 datasets (48% of all datasets). The second largest category is government
with 199 datasets (18%), followed by publications with 138 datasets (13%). Compared to the 2011 State of the LOD Cloud report, we observe a larger number
of datasets in all categories except geographic and media data. The category

government shows the largest growth, followed by the categories user-generated
content and life sciences. Excluding the new category social networking, the
overall number of Linked Datasets has approximately doubled from 2011 (294
datasets) to 2014 (571 datasets). Including the new category, we observe an
overall growth of 271% (from 294 to 1091 datasets).

4 Adoption of the Linking Best Practices

The linking best practice encourages publishers to set RDF links between datasets
in order to enable the discovery of additional data and to support the integration
of data from multiple sources. For analyzing the linkage between datasets, we
aggregate all RDF links by dataset, meaning that we consider two datasets to
be linked if there exists at least one RDF link between resources belonging to
the datasets.

4.1 Degree Distributions

In total, 56% of all datasets in our crawl set RDF links pointing to at least one
other dataset. The remaining 44% are either only the target of RDF links from
other datasets or are isolated. Figure 2 shows the distribution of the in- and
outdegrees for each category. We see that the in- and outdegrees vary widely
with a small number of datasets in each category being highly linked, while
the majority of the datasets is only sparsely linked. Overall, datasets from the
category social networking show the highest degree values. The categories cross-
domain, user-generated content, and geographic show an imbalance between inand outdegrees, with user-generated content having larger out- than indegrees,
and cross-domain and to a lesser extent geographic having larger in- than outdegrees (measured as area under the curve).

Looking at the top ten datasets by in- and outdegree in Table 2, we see that
datasets from categories social networking, user-generated content, and publications are among the top ten with respect to outdegree. While datasets with
a high indegree are dbpedia.org (cross-domain), geonames.org (geographic),
w3.org (cross-domain), reference.data.gov.uk (government) as well as several datasets from the category social networking.

4.2 Overall Graph Structure

Analyzing the overall graph structure, we find one large weakly connected component which consists of 71.99% of all datasets. In addition, there are three small
components, one consisting of three and two consisting of two datasets. Within
the large weakly connected component, there exists one large strongly connected
component consisting of 36.29% of all datasets.

Figure 3 shows the overall graph structure using the same LOD cloud visualization as the 2011 report. The size of the circles reflects the indegree of
the corresponding dataset. A zoom-able version of Figure 3 is available on
the accompanying website. Note that we have aggregated all individual FOAF
profiles into a single circle. Compared to the LOD cloud visualization from
the 2011 report which was centered around dbpedia.org as central linking
point, Figure 3 shows a much more decentralized graph with multiple highdegree nodes: The geonames.org and dbpedia.org datasets are linked by a
large number of datasets belonging to different topical categories. In addition,
the statistics.data.gov.uk and reference.data.gov.uk are highly linked
from within the government category. In the category publications, the Library
of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH) and the German National Library
(DNB) datasets are highly linked. We can also see in Figure 3 that the category
social networking is the most densely interlinked.

4.3 Predicates Used for Linking

Table 3 displays the top three predicates that are used by RDF links within each
topical domain. A first observation is that owl:sameAs is an important linking
predicate within most categories, followed by rdfs:seeAlso. The most notable
deviance is observed for the category social networking, where foaf:knows is
the most widely used linking predicate.

Due to the outstanding role of owl:sameAs as the most widely used linking
predicate, we take a closer look at the datasets connected by owl:sameAs links.
Searching for weakly connected components in the owl:sameAs graph, we find
one large weakly connected component containing 297 (29.3%) of all datasets.
Apart from that, there are only eight further components, out of which three
consist of three datasets and the remaining five consist of two datasets. Looking
at strongly connected components, we find one large component consisting of 74
datasets (7.3%), one with four and six with two datasets.

Table 4 shows the top ten datasets regarding in- and outdegree, this time
considering only owl:sameAs links. Compared to Table 2, we observe a much
smaller number of datasets from the category social networking as this category
is dominated by foaf:knows links.

5 Adoption of the Vocabulary Best Practices

The vocabularies used to represent data and their interpretability are a key
ingredient to make Linked Data semantic data. We consider a vocabulary to be
used by a dataset if a term from the vocabulary appears in the predicate position
of a triple from the dataset or at the object position of a rdf:type triple from
the dataset.

5.1 Usage of Well-Known Vocabularies

Table 5 lists the vocabularies that are used by more than five percent of all
datasets5. The vocabularies RDF, FOAF, RDFS, DCTerms, and OWL are the
top vocabularies used by many datasets from across all topical categories. Compared to the 2011 report, we can state that there is a trend towards the adoption
of well-known vocabularies by more datasets. For instance, while the FOAF vocabulary was used by 27.46% of all datasets in 2011, it is used by 69.1% of all
datasets in 2014. The same is true for the Dublin Core vocabulary which is used
today by 56.01% of the datasets and was used by only 31.19% in 2011.

The extent to which well-known vocabularies are used within the different
topical categories reveals some differences. In the category social networking,
there is a high quota of datasets using FOAF (85.96%), followed by the Dublin
Core and the WGS84 vocabulary used by 40% and 37% of all datasets. The
admin vocabulary, which is used by some FOAF generators, finds comparatively wide adoption. In the category publications, DCTerms is widely used at a
quota of 83%. Furthermore, the bibo ontology is used by 41.67% of the datasets

belonging to this category. The vocabularies SKOS, resourcelist, which is used
to create reading lists, and SIOC also find some adoption. In the category cross-
domain, several vocabularies are used by 10-40% of all datasets: The dbpedia.org,
georss.org, opengis.net, bibo, the prov vocabulary, the skos vocabulary, and void,
showing that a wide variety of topics is covered in this category. In the category
government, vocabularies for representing statistical data (cube with 61.75% and
sdmx with 26.22%) are found frequently. Vocabularies for expressing metadata,
like the void vocabulary, the sparql-service-description vocabulary, prov and prv
are also find some use. Within the category geographic, 66.67% of all datasets use
the WGS84 vocabulary for encoding geographic coordinates. Other well adopted
vocabularies are skos or the geonames ontology. In the category user-generated
content, many datasets use the FOAF vocabulary together with the SIOC vocabulary (50%) as well as the RSS and the admin vocabulary (both around
17%). The DOAP vocabulary is used by 12.5% of the datasets.

Please note that the schema.org vocabulary promoted by Google, Yahoo and
Microsoft is not listed in Table 5 as we found this vocabulary to be hardly used
in the Linked Data context6. In contrast, the vocabulary is very widely used
together with the Microdata syntax for annotating HTML pages [2].

5.2 Usage of Proprietary Vocabularies

Widely-used vocabularies often do not provide all terms that are needed to
publish the complete content of a dataset on the Web. Thus, data providers
often define proprietary terms that are used in addition to terms from widely
deployed vocabularies. We have also analyzed to which extent datasets from different categories make use of proprietary vocabularies. We consider a vocabulary
to be proprietary if it is used only by a single dataset. Out of the 638 different
vocabularies that we encountered in our crawl, 375 vocabularies (58.77%) are
proprietary according to our definition, while 263 (41.22%) are non-proprietary.
In total, 234 datasets (23.08%) use proprietary vocabularies, while nearly all
datasets also use non-proprietary vocabularies. These numbers show that the
adoption of the best practice to use common vocabularies is improving compared to the State of the LOD Cloud report from 2011 which found 64.41% of
all datasets to use proprietary terms. Table 6 further details the usage of proprietary vocabularies by topical category. The second column of the table shows
the number of proprietary vocabularies used by datasets from each category.
The third column contains the number of datasets in each category that use
proprietary vocabularies.

5.3 Dereferencability of Proprietary Vocabulary Terms

In order to enable applications to retrieve the definition of vocabulary terms,
the URIs identifying vocabulary terms should be made dereferencable. To assess

6 One data source that uses the schema.org type system in addition to its own type

system in order to increase interoperability is dbpedia.org.

whether a vocabulary is dereferencable, we requested the definitions of all used
terms from the vocabulary via HTTP GET requests. The resulting corpus of
vocabulary definitions is provided for download on the accompanying website.
We define the dereferencability quota of a vocabulary as the number of dereferencable terms divided by the number of all terms of the vocabulary. In total,
19.47% of all proprietary vocabularies are fully dereferencable (i.e., their quota
is 1.0). On the other hand, 71.73% of all proprietary vocabularies are not dereferencable at all. The remaining 8.8% of all proprietary vocabularies are partially
dereferencable, meaning that for some terms, but not for all, a definition could
be retrieved. Possible causes for partial dereferencability are namespace squat-
ting, i.e. accidentally or incidentally using terms not defined in a vocabulary, and
vocabularies having changed without proper marking of old terms as deprecated.
Columns 4, 5 and 6 in Table 6 show the percentage of fully, partially and not
dereferencable proprietary vocabularies per topical category.

5.4 RDF Links to Terms from Other Vocabularies

Vocabulary terms should be related to corresponding terms within other vocabularies in order to enable applications to understand as much data as possible.

vocabularies together with the percentage of all vocabularies using each predicate for linking. We see that 9.87% of all vocabularies use the rdfs:range
predicate to link to other vocabularies (for instance defining the range of a term
to be foaf:Person). The table also shows that only a very small fraction of the
vocabularies provides equivalence links to terms from other vocabularies.

6 Adoption of the Metadata Best Practices

The Linked Data best practices propose that every dataset should provide provenance and licensing information, dataset-level metadata, and information about
additional access methods.

6.1 Providing Provenance Information

For our evaluation, we have collected a list of vocabularies that are designed for
the representation of provenance information. Information about such vocabularies came from the W3C Provenance Working Group, the LOV vocabulary
catalog, as well as our own experience, adding up to a total of 26 vocabularies.
Using those vocabularies, we searched for provenance information in our corpus.
We followed the approach sugested in [5] and searched for triples using predicates
from those vocabularies and containing a document URI as subject.

As shown in Table 8, 36.69% of all datasets use some provenance vocabulary,
which is a slight decrease compared to the State of the LOD Cloud report from
2011, which reports 36.63% of all datasets to provide provenance information.
29.09% of all datasets use Dublin Core Terms, 11.05% use MetaVocab, while
W3C PRV and PROV are used by only 0.79% of the datasets. The provision
of provenance information is widely adopted in the publications and government
domains, while media and geographic datasets show less adoption. For government data, there is also a remarkable increase compared to the State of the LOD
Cloud document from 2011, which reports only 20.41% for this topical domain.

6.2 Providing Licensing Information

With the help of machine-readable licensing information, Linked Data applications can assess whether they may use data for their purpose at hand. To
evaluate whether a dataset provides license information, we again followed the
approach proposed in [5] and searched for triples which have the document as
their subject and a predicate containing the string licen. To this list, we added
all predicates containing the string rights as well as the waiver vocabulary,
which leads to a total of 47 terms.

In total, 9.96% of all datasets provide licensing information in RDF. This
number is lower than the 17.84% reported in the State of the LOD Cloud report
from 2011, but still higher than the 3.4% reported in [5]. The most important
predicates for indicating the license are dc/dct:license (7.39%), cc:license
(2.07%) and dc/dct:rights (1.68%). As shown in the last column of Table 8,
the provision of licensing information varies widely across topical domains. More
than a third of all government datasets provide licensing information, while none
of the geographic datasets provides licensing information. A main cause for the
low overall number is the category social networking which contains 48% of all
datasets and in which only 5.38% of the dataset offer licensing information.

6.3 Providing Dataset Level Metadata

Dataset-level metadata can be provided using the VoID vocabulary, either as
inline statements in the dataset or in a separate VoID file. In the latter case,
that file has to be linked from the data via backlinks or be provided at a wellknown location which is created by appending /.well-known/void to the host
part of a URI. As reported in [8], the latter condition is often too strict for
data providers due to missing root-level access to the servers. Thus, we follow
the approach proposed in [8] of relaxing the search for VoID files at well-known
locations, appending /.well-known/void to any portion of the URI.

In general, dataset-level metadata is still rarely provided by datasets within all
topical domains. Some trends towards emerging best practices and de facto standards can be observed: Dataset-level metadata is rather linked to than provided
at well-known locations and the Dublin Core vocabulary is becoming the defacto standard for providing dataset-level provenance information. In total, 149
datasets (14.69%) use the VoID vocabulary. Out of these datasets, 42 (4.14%)
use a backlinking mechanism. Columns 2 to 5 of Table 9 show the VoID adoption
by topical category.

Compared to the 2011 report, the overall percentage of datasets publishing dataset-level metadata using VoiD has decreased from 32.20% to 14.69%,
with the categories government, geographic, and life sciences being exceptions
in which the adoption has slightly grown. Again, the category social networking
is a main cause for the low overall number.

6.4 Providing Alternative Access Methods

According to the 2011 State of the LOD Cloud report, many datasets provide
additional access methods, such as SPARQL endpoints (68.14%) and dumps
(39.66%). In our analysis, the numbers are much lower as shown in columns 6 to
8 of Table 9. Apart from the government, life sciences and geographic domains,
almost no information on alternative access methods are found. The deviation
can be explained by the fact that we only look at those alternative access methods
that can be discovered via VoID descriptions linked from the datasets or provided
at well-known URLs. As reported in [8], the actual number of existing SPARQL
endpoints may be higher, as many endpoints cannot be discovered from the
data. This is a severe problem for automatic agents navigating the Linked Data
graph, as they are not capable of discovering alternative access methods. While
the numbers for alternative access methods are low, one has to keep in mind that
such methods do not always make sense. For example, the large number of small
FOAF files in the social networking category are mostly datasets contained in
exactly one file. In these cases, it does not make sense to provide a data dump,
because the file itself is a data dump. Likewise, the use of a SPARQL endpoint
for a dataset consisting of only a few dozen triples would not justify the provision
effort.

7 Related Work

An effort that is closely related to the work presented in this paper is the LODStats project7 which has retrieved and analyzed Linked Data from the Web until
February 2014 [1]. The LODStats website provides statistics about the overall
number of discovered linked datasets as well as the adoption of different vocab-
ularies. What distinguishes LODStats from the work presented in this paper is
that they do not categorize datasets by topical domain and do not analyze the

overall graph structure, as well as the conformance with the best practices in
the areas of vocabulary dereferencability and metadata provision. Their results
concerning the overall number of accessible datasets (they found 928 datasets)
and the adoption of well-known vocabularies are inline with the findings of this
paper.

A comprehensive empirical survey of Linked Data conformance is presented
by Hogan et al. [5]. Their survey is based on a large-scale Linked Data crawl
from May 2010 as well as a series of smaller snapshots taken between March
and November 2010. The work presented in this paper can be seen as an update
of the results presented by Hogan et al. as we use a crawl from March 2014.
Another major difference is that Hogan et al. do not categorize datasets by
topical domain and thus can not analyze the differences in the adoption of the
best practices in different domains. The article by Hogan et al. contains a detailed
and comprehensive discussion of earlier work on analyzing the adoption of the
Linked Data practices as well as work in the wider area of characterizing the
Semantic Web/Linked Data, its link structure as well as the semantics of its
content. The discussion covers related work from the time span of 2005 to 2012.
For space reasons, we can not repeat this excellent review of related work here.
The general difference between the works discussed by Hogan et al. and our work
is that our analysis is more up-to-date and that we distinguish the datasets by
topical domain.

8 Conclusion

This paper revisited and updated the finding of the State of the LOD Cloud
report [7] from 2011 based on a Linked Data crawl gathered in April 2014.
Our analysis shows that the overall number of Linked Datasets on the Web has
grown significantly since 2011. Looking only at the topical categories covered
in the original report, the number of datasets has approximately doubled since
2011. Also taking the category social networking into account, the number of
datasets has grown by 271%.

Concerning the linkage of the datasets, our analysis shows that there is still a
relatively small number of datasets that set RDF links pointing at many other
datasets, while many datasets only links to a few other datasets. Compared to the
2011 LOD cloud, which was centered around dbpedia.org as central linking hub,
we have discovered a more decentralized graph structure with geonames.org
and dbpedia.org being linked from many datasets besides of the existence of
further category-specific linking hubs. Concerning the types of RDF links that
connect datasets, we have found the predicates owl:sameAs, rdfs:seeAlso and
foaf:knows to be most widely used.

We have observed a trend towards the adoption of well-known vocabularies
by more datasets, the most prominent one being FOAF, which is used by more
than two thirds of all linked datasets, independent of their respective topical
domain. In parallel, the usage of proprietary vocabularies has decreased from
64.41% in 2011 to 23.08% of all datasets in 2014.

M. Schmachtenberg, C. Bizer, and H. Paulheim

While provenance information is provided for roughly a third of all datasets,
only 10% of all datasets provide machine-readable licensing information. A positive exception concerning licensing information is the government domain in
which licensing information is provided by 30% of all dataset. Compared to
the 2011 report, the percentage of datasets providing provenance metadata is
approximately the same, while the percentage of datasets providing machinereadable licensing information has dropped from 17% to 10%. The similar
negative trend is also found for the percentage of datasets publishing datasetlevel metadata using VoID. In 2011, 32.20% of all datasets published VoID while
in 2014 only 14.69% provide such metadata. The categories government, ge-
ographic, and life sciences are exceptions to this trend and the adoption has
slightly grown in these domains.
