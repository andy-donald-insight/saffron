Abstract. Millions of owl:sameAs statements have been published on the Web 
of  Data.  Due  to  its  unique  role  and  heavy  usage  in  Linked  Data  integration, 
owl:sameAs  has  become  a  topic  of  increasing  interest  and  debate.  This  paper 
provides  a  quantitative  analysis  of  owl:sameAs  deployment  status  and  uses 
these statistics to focus discussion around its usage in Linked Data.  

Keywords: owl:sameAs, Linked Data, Network. 

1   Introduction 

The Web of Data is growing rapidly, with an ever-expanding set of inter-connected 
datasets depicted in the Linking Open Data (LOD) cloud diagram [1]. In the Web of 
Data, an increasing number of owl:sameAs statements have been published to support 
merging distributed descriptions of equivalent RDF resources. Although these statements  are  just  binary  relations,  when  all  of  these  owl:sameAs  statements  are  taken 
together,  they  form  a  very  large  directed  graph  connecting  RDF  resources  to  each 
other.    We  will  refer  to  this  large  graph  of  RDF  resources  connected  by  sameAs 
statements  as  a  SameAs  network.  SameAs  networks  are  interesting  both  for  their 
structural properties, e.g. size, diameter and in/out-degree and their semantic proper-
ties, e.g. reflexivity, symmetry and transitivity.  

According to OWL semantics [2], all RDF resources in a single sameAs network 
are indistinguishable, such that they can be merged into one RDF resource and change 
the structure of RDF graph. However, recent literature [3-7], mainly from the Linked 
Data  community,  reports  many  issues  related  to  owl:sameAs  usage  in  the  Web  of 
Data:  owl:sameAs  is  often  used  in  ways  that  do  not  strictly  agree  with  the  official 
semantics  of  owl:sameAs  in  OWL.  Some  researchers  [4,  6]  further  called  for  new 
ontological  semantic  relations  to  complement  owl:sameAs  in  capturing  similarity 
relations between RDF resources. To the best of our knowledge, most reported results 
on owl:sameAs are derived from very small sample datasets, and no statistically significant  analysis  has  been  conducted  on  the  deployment  status  and  implications  of 
owl:sameAs in the Web of Data.  

We  conducted  a  large  scale  analysis  on  SameAs  networks  extracted  from  the  
Web of Data to answer two types of key questions: (i) How is owl:sameAs actually 
deployed?  How  many  SameAs  networks  have  been  published?  Do  these  SameAs

networks  have  interesting  topological  properties?  (ii)  What  are  the  implications  of 
owl:sameAs inference in Linked Data integration? How can owl:sameAs be used  to 
connect the ontologies of the datasets in the LOD cloud? In order to reduce the bias 
caused  by  a  small  sample  dataset,  we  use  the  Billion  Triple  Challenge  (BTC) 2010 
dataset which covers a significant portion of the Web of Data.  

This work provides contributions related to the definition and analysis of SameAs 
networks. We highlight the practical value of our work in network settings focusing 
on (1) how Linked Open Datasets are connected and (2) how sameAs networks may 
be used for automated ontology mapping and error detection. The rest of this paper is 
structured  as  follows.  Section  2  defines  SameAs  networks  and  identifies  research 
problems. Section 3 describes the sample dataset extracted from the BTC 2010 dataset 
and  experiment  settings.  Sections  4,  5  and  6  report  the  analytical  discoveries  on 
SameAs  networks,  along  with  two  special  classes  of  networks  (Pay-Level  Domains 
and Class-Level Similarity). Section 7 reviews related work. Section 8 concludes our 
work with future directions. 

2   SameAs Networks 

The  importance  of  owl:sameAs  in  Linked  Data  integration  is  widely  recognized, 
however there have not been many studies characterizing its usage in very large data-
sets. The goal of our work was to review existing usage of owl:sameAs in a dataset 
that contains a significant number of sameAs statements and also to analyze usage in 
a practical Linked Data integration setting. We therefore will define the  notion of a 
SameAs  network  and  then  show  a  selection  of  research  problems  derived  from  the 
motivating questions from Section 1.  

2.1   Definitions and Notations 

Definition  1. SameAs statement. A  SameAs  statement is an RDF triple  which connects two RDF resources by means of an owl:sameAs predicate. 

 

Definition 2. Predicate-based Sub-graph Filter. A Predicate-based Sub-graph Filter is a function H = psf(G, P), where H and G are RDF graphs and P is a set of RDF 
properties. This function returns H which is a sub-graph of G, and the predicate of any 
triple in H is a member of P. 
 
Definition 3. SameAs network. Given an RDF graph G, a SameAs network SN in G is 
a weakly connected component1 of psf(G, {owl:sameAs}).  
 
Figure  1  illustrates  an  example  SameAs  Network,  where  an  RDF  resource  
dbpedia:Paul_Allen2 
is  denoted  as  a  node,  and  a  SameAs  statement  
                                                           
 1 A weakly connected component is a maximum sub-graph where all pairs of nodes are by an 

undirected path. See 
http://mathworld.wolfram.com/WeaklyConnectedComponent.html 

 2 Throughout this paper, we use QName to encode URI reference and Turtle to encode RDF 

triples and RDF graphs. See http://www.w3.org/TeamSubmission/turtle/

dbpedia:Paul_Allen  owl:sameAs  umbel:Paul_Allen  is  denoted  as  a  directed  arc. 
This  figure  also  exhibits  additional  interesting  structural  patterns:  (i)  two  RDF  resources could be linked by one-way or and reciprocal owl:sameAs statements; and (ii) 
there  exist  authority  nodes  (with  high  in-degree,  e.g.  dbpedia:Paul_Allen)  and  hub 
nodes (with high out-degree, e.g. freebase:guid.9202a8c04000641f800000000002e633).  

Fig. 1. An example SameAs network about Paul Allen 

 

The  official  semantics  of  owl:sameAs  is  specified  in  OWL  [2]:  an  owl:sameAs 
statement indicates that two URI references actually refer to the same thing. Recent 
studies reported diverse usage that is NOT consistent with the official semantics: 

 

 

Is owl:sameAs symmetric? Vatant [7] suggested that owl:sameAs, when used 
in  mashup,  is  not  necessarily  a  symmetric  property,  i.e.,  X  owl:sameAs  Y 
does  not  imply  Y  owl:sameAs  X.  Therefore,  two  RDF  resources  X  and  Y 
are considered to be strongly equivalent only when their owners make reciprocal SameAs statements.  
Is owl:sameAs transitive? Jaffri et al [5] reported that the equivalence relationship  represented  by  owl:sameAs  is  often  context-dependent,  and  is  accurate 
only  within  the  context  of  particular  applications.  While  transitivity  is  automatically granted by OWL semantics, SameAs statements asserted in the Web 
of Data seldom guarantee transitivity. 

2.2   SameAs Networks Analysis 

In order to analyze the deployment status and implications of SameAs Networks, we 
identify the following three research problems:  

 

How have SameAs Networks been deployed on the Web of Data? Since we are not 
the owners of the SameAs statements in the Web of Data, it would be quite subjective 
to speculate the intended semantics of owl:sameAs. In order to produce objective and 

L. Ding et al. 

convincible  reports,  we  focus  on  the  structural  properties  of  SameAs  networks.  In 
order to avoid the bias caused by small sample datasets, we collected a large sample 
dataset from the real world Web of Data. Section 3 provides a quantitative analysis of 
the dataset.  

 

What are the common interests among Linked Data publishers? Since there are 
many  URIs  using  dbpedia  for  a  namespace  in  the  example  SameAs  network  in 
Figure 1, it is possible to summarize SameAs statements to higher level connections 
to provide an overview of SameAs networks. We are particularly interested in pay-
level domain (PLD)3 as it is frequently used to identify Linked Data publishers and 
can  often  be  connected  to  LOD  datasets  via  one-to-one  mappings.  Now,  with  such 
summarization,  users  can  analyze  how  and  why  Linked  Data  publishers  (or  LOD 
datasets) are inter-connected via SameAs statements.   

 

How  will  Web  ontologies  be  affected  by  owl:sameAs  inference?  Mapping  Web 
ontologies is a well-known difficult problem due to the high cost of manually asserting mapping relations among ontological terms. Instance-based approaches have been 
used in mapping RDFS/OWL classes, i.e. two classes are considered associated if 
they  share  common  instances.  Now,  with  owl:sameAs  inference,  users  may  merge 
different RDF resources and thus find more associated classes.  

3   Building ESameNet Dataset and Experiment Settings 

In order to study the three problems identified in section 2.2, we will extend SameAs 
networks with additional information:  

  PLD statements, each RDF resource can be connected to a literal name identifying a PLD. PLD statements can be pre-computed before the creation of 
SameAs networks and stored in triples using ex:hasPLD as predicate.  

  Type  statements,  each  RDF  is  connected  to  zero-to-many  RDFS/OWL 
classes via rdf:type. Type statements are already asserted in the RDF graph 
from which SameAs networks were obtained. 

 
Definition  4:  Extended  SameAs  network.  Given  an  RDF  graph  G,  an  extended 
SameAs  network  ESN is constructed by extending a SameAs network  SN of  G  with 
additional nodes and arcs.  Besides the RES world, i.e. the world of all RDF resources 
in  SN, two  more  worlds of nodes will be added:  (i) the CLS  world, i.e. a world of 
RDFS/OWL classes; (iii) the PLD world, i.e. a world of PLD names. A new node n 
will be added when there exists a PLD (or Type) statement s that links from a node in 
SN to n. Meanwhile, the corresponding statement s will be added as a new arc.   

                                                           
 3 A PLD is an internet domain that requires payment at a generic top-level domain (gTLD) or 
country code top-level domain (ccTLD) registrar. PLDs are usually one level below the corresponding  gTLD  (e.g.,  dbpedia.org  vs.  org),  with  certain  exceptions  for  cc-TLDs  (e.g., 
ebay.co.uk, det.wa.edu.au) [8].

Figure 2 illustrates an example fragment of an extended SameAs network, including: 
RDF  resources,  e.g.  dbpedia:Virginia  and  fbase:en.virginia;  PLD  statements,  e.g. 
dbpedia:Virginia  ex:hasPLD  dbpedia.org.  and  CLS  statements,  e.g.  dbpe-
dia:Virginia rdf:type yago:StatesOfTheUnitedStates, dbpedia-owl:Place. 

  

 

Fig. 2. An example fragment of an extended SameAs network 

Our  study  is  based  on  the  ESameNet  dataset  (a  collection  of  extended  SameAs 
networks) extracted  from the  BTC 2010 dataset. We chose this dataset  for two rea-
sons: (i) With approximately 9 million SameAs statements, it constitutes a large-scale 
sample dataset which is suitable for providing statistical results with high confidence; 
(ii) Since the BTC 2010 dataset was gathered by crawling the Web based on seeding 
datasets provided by major Semantic Web search engines, it can be considered as a 
representative  sample  of  the  Web  of  Data,  with  relatively  low  sample  distribution 
bias.   

The ESameNet dataset is publicly available4 in N-Quads5 format and it consists of 

the following three subsets: 

  SameAs statements. We copied all SameAs statements in the BTC 2010 dataset and removed invalid and duplicate statements. A few SameAs statements 
do not comply with Definition 1 (SameAs statement), e.g. some simply connect an RDF resource to a literal string6. From 9,358,227 valid SameAs state-
ments,  we  obtained  8,711,398  triples  after  removing  duplications.  These 
statements covered 6,932,678 unique RDF resources  with URI (aka. URI re-
source) and 645,400 blank nodes. 

  Type statements. We copied all rdf:type statements for RDF resources mentioned  in  BTC  2010  dataset  and  found  552,622,105  such  statements.  These

statements covered 488,138,983 distinct RDF resources, and 168,503 distinct 
RDFS/OWL classes. 

  PLD statements: We extracted PLD (pay-level domain) statements by parsing 
the URI of RDF resources in SameAs networks using regular expression. For 
RDF resource with HTTP URI, we can directly extract its PLD and create the 
PLD statement. For blank nodes (or RDF resources with non-HTTP URI), we 
assume they share the same PLDs as the named graphs which host the corresponding SameAs statements. These statements covered 967 distinct PLDs.   

 
In our experiments, we used the AllegroGraph triple store (version 4.0)7 and the Allegro Common Lisp (version 8.2)8 programming environment to load the entire BTC 
2010  dataset  and  extract  the  ESameNet  dataset.  All  of  the  computational  tasks  described in this paper were executed on a server with 2x Quad-Core Intel Xeon CPU 
2.33GHz CPU, 64GB physical memory and 4 TB hard disk space. 

4   Basic Properties of SameAs Networks  

We first analyze the basic properties of SameAs Networks in the ESameNet dataset. 
Each  SameAs  network  is  essentially  a  graph  of  URIs  connected  by  non-redundant 
owl:sameAs  statements.  Due  to  the  difficulties  and  limitations  of  automatic  entity 
resolution, the creation of owl:sameAs statements is usually costly and requires manual efforts. Therefore, there are fewer owl:sameAs statements in the Web of Data than 
one might expect. 
 
Weakly connected components. Overall, the ESameNet dataset contains 6,932,678 
URI  resources  connected  by  8,711,398  unique  owl:sameAs  statements.    The  graph 
consists of 2,890,027 weakly connected components, each of which covers on average 2.4 URI resources. The average path length of the  graph is only 1.07,  which  is 
consistent with this very small average component size (see Figure 3); most components  are  simply  pairs  of  nodes  joined  by  (usually  reciprocal)  owl:sameAs  links. 
There are a small number of larger components, including 41 components with hundreds of resources, and two components  with thousands of resources. This observation  implies  that  the  typical  size  of  SameAs  networks  is  either  a  small  constant  or 
growing  slowly;  therefore,  performing  transitive  inference  on  individual  SameAs 
networks is not expensive and could be parallelized. A manual inspection of individual components revealed that the vast majority were star-like in structure, consisting 
of a single central resource connected to a number of peripheral resources. SameAs 
networks are not large and complex networks like those of foaf:knows, or even shallow tree-like structures like those of rdfs:subClassOf. Furthermore, SameAs networks 
tends to have small size components: 24,559 persons were found in the largest component of the foaf:knows network in 2005 [9] vs. 5000 resources were found in the

largest component in SameAs networks in 2010. One potential explanation could be 
that  Linked  Data  principles  are  in  favor  of  reusing  URIs  rather  than  duplicating  
resource  decriptions  in  many  distinct  LOD  datasets.  An  alternative  explanation  is  
that  people  simply  havent  done  enough  large-scale  linking  yet9  due  to  technology 
limitations.

Degree distribution. We investigated the overall in-degree distribution of ESameNet 
as it measures the popularity (or authority) of resources in sameAs networks10. Having plotted the in-degree distribution on a log-log scale, we can see that it exhibits the 
power law pattern characteristic of scale-free networks. We also noticed that there are 
slightly  more  resources  with  an  owl:sameAs  in-degree  of  1  (that  is,  2,974,914  re-
sources) than one would expect of a power law distribution (see Figure 4), and there 
are  also  slightly  more  resources  in  the  10  to  20  range  of  in-degree  than  one  would 
expect.  The resources at the high end of the distribution contain on the order of 4,000 
inbound owl:sameAs links.  Note that we omitted resources with no inbound links. 

 

                                                           
 9 This alternative explanation is kindly suggested by reviewers of this paper. 
10 We skipped out-degree analysis to save space. The out-degree is typically controlled by the 
publishers for sameAs statements, but the in-degree shows how many publishers are willing 
to link to a resource using owl:sameAs.

5   Pay-Level-Domain (PLD) Network Analysis 

In  order  to  gain  deeper  understanding  of  the  common  interests  between  different 
Linked  Data  publishers,  users  may  demand  a  high-level  meaningful  network  to  abstract  the  SameAs  networks.  The  PLD  statements  provide  an  ideal  opportunity  to 
meet this demand because a PLD can often be used to identify Linked Data publishers 
and millions of RDF resources in ESameNet can be reduced to hundreds of PLDs. 

5.1   Definitions and Notations 

Definition 5. PLD network. A PLD network is a weighted directed graph where (i) 
each  node  denotes  a  unique  PLD  (labeled  by  PLD  name);  (ii)  each  arc  links  two 
PLDs.  The  weight  of  an  arc  <pld1,  pld2>  is  calculated  by  counting  the  unique 
SameAs  statements  between  any  possible  pair  of  u1  and  u2,  where  (u1  ex:hasPLD 
pld1) and (u2 ex:hasPLD pld2), normalized by the out degree of pld1. 

Intuitively, the PLD network is an abstraction of SameAs Networks where each PLD 
groups  some  RDF  resources.  Arcs  in  PLD  network  are  created  using  the  following 
SPARQL query: 

 
SELECT ?pld1  ?pld2  
WHERE { ?u1  ex:hasPLD ?pld1 .  ?u2  ex:hasPLD ?pld2 . ?u1 owl:sameAs? u2 . }

Figure  5  shows  the  largest  (also  the  most  interesting)  cluster  in  the  PLD  network11 
generated from the ESameNet dataset, plotted using Cytoscape [10]. In this diagram, 
the size of a node is determined by the sum of the weights of both its incoming and 
outgoing arcs. The thickness of an arc is determined only by its weight. For the purpose of visual clarity, we omit arcs whose weight is less than a threshold (0.00001 in 
this study with 0.069 being the maximum weight), and self-loops (arcs linking from a 
node to the node itself). The color of a node is randomly assigned, with the guarantee 
that no two nodes have the same color. We adopt the Organic graph layout provided 
by Cytoscape to render this diagram to visually highlight clusters.

11 Due to space limitations, only the most significant cluster is shown. Other clusters can also 

be generated using the same method and tools as discussed.

5.2   Implications of the PLD Network 

The PLD network is an abstraction of SameAs networks in that it establishes connections  at  PLD  level  based  on  instance-level  SameAs  statements,  while  retaining  the 
basic  structure  of  one-per-dataset  nodes  connected  by  links  in  a  star-like  fashion.  It 
can help us gain better insights to the following research problems: 

 

How  are  data  publishers  connected?  The  PLD  network  provides  intuitive  and 
straightforward insights into how publishers are connected via owl:sameAs assertions 
and what communities are potentially emerging. Figure 5 shows a clear depiction of 
the associations between different data publishers, in which thicker arcs reflect intensive occurrences of owl:sameAs assertions between corresponding domains. By using 
appropriate clustering algorithms which apply to any generic graph (e.g., social net-
work), communities of data publishers can be easily identified by eyes. Nodes inside 
such  a  cluster  can  be  considered  as  covering  similar  topics  from  possibly  different 
perspectives.  In  Figure  5,  some  clusters  can  be  visually  identified.  The  cluster  with 
the  set  of  PLD  nodes  {ls3.de,  rkbexplorer.com,  uni-tier.de,  sciencedirect.com, 
acm.org, gbv.de, doi.org} represents a community whose members publish data about 
scientific publications. Other clusters centering on bioinformatics and Semantic Web 
communities can also be easily identified. In general, we believe that applying novel 
clustering  algorithms  to  this  large-scale  PLD  network  will  facilitate  detection  of 
communities  that  share  common  knowledge  and  interests.  We  perceive  this  as  an 
interesting future research direction. 

 

Why are data publishers connected? After determining which Linked Data publishers are connected via owl:sameAs assertions, it is natural to further investigate  why 
they are connected. Although it is possible to achieve this goal by manually analyzing 
Figure  5,  it  usually  requires  strong  expertise  in  Linked  Data,  and  thus  is  laborintensive  and  error-prone.  With  the  help  of  rdf:type  information,  semi-automatic  or 
even automatic ways of explaining such connectivity is possible. 
 

For all owl:sameAs statements between the source PLD d1 and target PLD d2, we 

can retrieve the rdf:type information for u and v using the following SPARQL query: 

 
SELECT ?subj_type ?obj_type 
WHERE { 

?s ex:hasPLD d1.  
?o ex:hasPLD d2. 
?s a ?sub_type. 
?o a ?obj_type. 

} 
 

Then  comparing  the  k-most  frequently  used  types  in  d1  with  the  k-most  frequently 
used types in d2 can help us to understand how the instance resources served by d1 
and d2 are connected. Table 1 lists the top five (if exists) type labels for the source 
and target PLD of arcs.

The first row in Table 1 indicates that both PLD  d1 = dbtune.org and PLD  d2 = 
zitgist.com are publishing data about music, because the top five types related to all 
owl:sameAs  links  between  them  are  generally  well  aligned  and  are  using  concepts 
from the Music Ontology12. Row 2, 3, and 4 are all missing the type information in 
the  target  PLD,  which  indicates  that  cross-PLD  owl:sameAs  links  do  not  have  type 
information for resources in the target PLD. Finally, the top five types in the source 
and target PLD do not align very well in the last row. This might be due to the vast 
amount  of  general  human  knowledge  encoded  by  dbpedia.org  and  freebase.com,  as 
well as the unique role of "knowledge hubs" that they have been playing on the Web. 
Actually,  the  top-k  types  discussed  here  can  also  be  used  to  form  a  more  complete 
view of either the source or the target PLD, in which case the owl:sameAs statements 
function as a clue for discovering more information for either side.

In order to show how Web ontologies are affected by owl:sameAs inference, we select an ontology mapping use-case: detecting the relations between two RDFS/OWL

classes.  Two classes are considered overlapping when they share common instances. 
Classes inter-connected by such class-overlap relation form a Class-Level Similarity (CLS) network. With the CLS network, users can automatically detect clusters of 
classes and ontology mappings using machine learning techniques.  

6.1   Definitions and Notation 

Definition 6: CLS network. A CLS network is a weighted directed graph of classes 
where  (i)  each  node  denotes  a  unique  RDFS/OWL  class;  (ii)  each  arc  links  two 
classes using one of the following relations: equivalence, subclass-of, disjointness and 
class-overlap. While the first three types of relations can be mapped to OWL proper-
ties, the last one cannot. The weight of an arc is calculated based on the number of 
common instances shared by the two classes linked by the arc. 

 

As  shown  in  Table  2,  A  CLS  network  can  be  constructed  using  SPARQL  queries, 
namely Query A and Query B. Note that Query B leverages owl:sameAs inference to 
derive  additional  class-overlap  relations,  and  it  simply  assumes  that  owl:sameAs  is 
neither symmetric nor transitive. Other possible assumptions are left for future study.

CONSTRUCT  ?C1 ex:overlaps ?C2  
WHERE  { ?s a ?C1, ?C2.  filter (?C1!=?C2) } 

CONSTRUCT  ?C1 ex:overlaps ?C2  
WHERE { ?u1  a ?C1 .  ?u2  a ?C2 .  ?u1 owl:sameAs ?u2. filter (?C1 != ?C2)  } 

6.2   CLS Network and Enhancement 

We executed Query A on all Type statements in ESameNet to build a CLS network 
CLS-ALL, which contains 168,503 unique nodes (RDFS/OWL classes) and hundreds 
of  millions  of  arcs.  Overall,  the  in-degree  of  classes  (i.e.  how  many  instances  the 
classes have) follows a power-law distribution: about 45% (77 K) classes only have 
one instance, while a few have over 100 million instances each.   

Focusing  on  the  RDF  resources  connected  by  SameAs  statements,  we  created  a 
smaller CLS network CLS-SAME, which contains 6,555 unique nodes (RDFS/OWL 
classes) and 21,628 arcs (weighted differently) using Query B. Although CLS-SAME 
is  much  smaller  than  CLS-ALL,  it  helps  users  to  quickly  gather  additional  pairs  of 
classes for determining class-level relations. Table 3 lists 20 class pairs in the CLSSAME dataset. We found a couple of interesting observations:  

  The  rows  with  type  [EQ]  show  that  some  class  pairs  could  be  mapped  via 
equivalence relation because their URIs have the same local-name. This kind 
of class pairing can be used to guess equivalence relations.  

  The rows with type [ERR] show that some class pairs may also be inappropriate  mappings  after  checking  their  ontological  definitions.  Although  this 
kind of class pairing does not help ontology mapping, it does help users to 
detect potential errors in Linked Data.

  The rows without a type label show that it is hard to determine the mapping 
relations between the class pairs by checking their URIs or ontological defi-
nitions. This kind of case usually involves a general-purpose class, such as

The above observations about the class pairs in the  CLS  network reflect that  the 
BTC 2010 dataset is quite heterogenous and the current Semantic Web vocabularies 
are largely orthogonal. They also enlighten the potential use of the CLS network: with 
effective classification techniques, we may appropriately label class pairs in the CLS 
network and then support automated class alignment and error detection.  In our future  work  will also try other combinations of assumptions  including the assumption 
that owl:sameAs is transitive. 

7   Related Work 

Various  recent  literature  [4-6]  investigating  pragmatic  issues  of  owl:sameAs  in  the 
context of the Web of Data can be considered as directly related to our study. They 
provide valuable  insights into the essential research problem of  whether  the  ubiquitous  use  of  owl:sameAs  to  inter-linked  datasets  is  correct.  Some  of  them  identify 

L. Ding et al. 

incorrect usages of owl:sameAs in the Web of Data [5], leading to the explicit need 
for a co-reference management infrastructure for the Semantic Web. Others carry out 
in-depth  discussions  of  the  issues  with  the  current  semantics  of  owl:sameAs.  For 
example,  McCusker  and  McGuinness  [6]  discuss  how  and  why  using  owl:sameAs 
could possibly result in confusions of provenance and ground truths in the bioinformatics context. Halpin and Hayes [4] view owl:sameAs statements as a special type 
of identity link, and analyze the more general problem of identity links on the Semantic  Web  from  a  philosophical  and  knowledge  representation  perspective.  They 
also outline four alternative interpretations of owl:sameAs, which all differ from the 
canonical OWL semantics as defined by W3C documents. Our work differs from all 
of the above in that, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to conduct this type 
of large-scale empirical study on the deployment status of owl:sameAs using datasets 
from the Web of Data. 

Another related research effort is the analysis of the graph structure of the Semantic Web. Some recent work [13-17] presents important graph metrics that reflect the 
basic  shape,  structure,  and  even  dynamics  of  the  whole  Semantic  Web  viewed  as  a 
giant  graph.  It  is  reported  in  [14]  that  ontologies  on  the  Semantic  Web,  like  many 
natural and social networks, are scale-free. Some earlier [16, 17] and later [15] studies 
show more structural features of the Semantic Web, such as size, diameter and powerlaw degree distribution of the graph. In one of the more recent efforts that falls into 
this category, Ge et al [13] propose the notion of an Object Link Graph (OLG) for the 
Semantic Web, and show that it is also scale-free and has a small diameter. Our work 
is  similar  to  these  research  efforts  in  the  sense  that  we  also  present  critical  graph 
structure metrics. However, the subject of research focus, i.e., the owl:sameAs state-
ments, and the scale are two major factors that differentiate our work with theirs. 

Some of the existing endeavors, which make use of instance-level links to derive 
potential alignments and associations at the schema level, are also related to our work. 
Qu et al [18] propose the notion of a Class Association Graph (CAG), which is obtained  from  the  Object  Link  Graph  (OLG)  defined  in  [13].  Similarly,  Nikolov  et  al 
[19]  illustrate  how  to  establish  schema-level  mappings  based  on  existing  instancelevel  mappings  in  the  Web  of  Data.  Our  study  shares  essentially  the  same  idea  of 
deriving schema-level relations using vast amounts of instance-level data. 

8   Conclusion and Future Work 

In order to better understand and use owl:sameAs in Linked Data, it is useful to study 
how owl:sameAs is actually deployed, which has implications for how data should be 
consumed. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first study on SameAs networks  extracted  from  the  real  world  Web  of  Data,  and  it  has  reported  statistically 
significant results based on the BTC 2010 dataset. The experiment results are the core 
of  this  work,  and  they  support  the  goal  of  this  paper    to  highlight  the  uniqueness, 
interestingness and utility of SameAs networks to Linked Data researchers as well as 
practitioners.  

  Section  4  shows  that  SameAs  networks  have  unique  graph  properties  in 
comparison with other networks in the Semantic Web. The graph properties 
also lead to nice computational properties of the SameAs network.

  Section 5 explains the interestingness of SameAs networks by showing the 
similarity  between  the  PLD  network  and  the  LOD  graph.  We  also  showed 
that  the  PLD  network  could  be  used  to  explain  how  LOD  datasets  are 
actually linked by common topics. 

  Section 6 shows one practical use of SameAs networks, where classes can be 
linked  by  means  of  common  instances  (derived  by  owl:sameAs  inference). 
The  CLS  network  has  a  great  potential 
in  detecting  schema-level 
inconsistencies in interlinked datasets and supporting ontology alignment. 

 
The results reported in this study can be easily extended with additional data, semantics and applications. For example, we can enrich the ESameNet dataset with SameAs 
statements generated using OWL inference on the entire BTC dataset (e.g. inferring 
owl:sameAs using owl:InverseFunctionalProperty) [11] and then evaluate the impact 
on the diameter of SameAs networks. Although this study does not assume the transitivity of owl:sameAs for the purpose of deriving the CLS network,  future work may 
explore  the  alternative  -  evaluating  the  impact  of  transitive  inference  on  SameAs 
networks. Another potential research direction is to follow up on our previous discussions on the operational semantics of owl:sameAs [12]. Last but not least, it is worth 
noting that owl:sameAs has implications not only for the two networks mentioned in 
this study, but rather, we can use BTC datasets from consecutive years to evaluate the 
evolution of SameAs Networks over time, and use owl:sameAs statements to compute 
property-level mappings.
