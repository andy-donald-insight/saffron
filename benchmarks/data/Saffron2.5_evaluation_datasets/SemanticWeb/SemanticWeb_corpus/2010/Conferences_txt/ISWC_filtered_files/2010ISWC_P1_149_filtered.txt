Abstract. Measuring similarity between ontologies can be very useful for different purposes, e.g., finding an ontology to replace another, or finding an ontology
in which queries can be translated. Classical measures compute similarities or distances in an ontology space by directly comparing the content of ontologies. We
introduce a new family of ontology measures computed in an alignment space:
they evaluate the similarity between two ontologies with regard to the available
alignments between them. We define two sets of such measures relying on the existence of a path between ontologies or on the ontology entities that are preserved
by the alignments. The former accounts for known relations between ontologies,
while the latter reflects the possibility to perform actions such as instance import
or query translation. All these measures have been implemented in the OntoSim
library, that has been used in experiments which showed that entity preserving
measures are comparable to the best ontology space measures. Moreover, they
showed a robust behaviour with respect to the alteration of the alignment space.

1 Introduction

There are many uses for measuring the proximity between ontologies, such as finding
a representation in which some assertions can be translated or queried. In [1], we compared distances between ontologies based on ontology content. In this paper, we extend
this work by distinguishing between measures in an ontology space, obtained by comparing the content of ontologies, and measures in an alignment space, obtained with
regard to how the ontologies are related by alignments.

We call alignment space a structure populated by ontologies related by alignments.
An alignment expresses relations between entities in the ontologies [2]. More specifi-
cally, a distance or similarity measure is alignment-based if it is computed without relying on the content of ontologies, but only on that of the alignments. So, such measures
can only be applied when alignments are available, but we assume that the semantic
web will have the characteristic of such a space with many ontologies already available
and some alignments, sometimes competing, between them.

Alignment space measures may seem more remote from the true distance between
ontologies because they do not directly consider ontology content. However, there are
cases in which they can be very useful. This is obviously the case when ontologies
are not available, e.g., because they are on a closed server, but alignments between

these ontologies and others exist. Such unavailable ontologies may be used as a target
ontology or as an intermediate ontology (and then alignments may be composed).

This is also the case when the similarity between ontologies has to reflect the ability to transform a statement or a query from one ontology to another, e.g., in semantic
peer-to-peer systems or dynamic composition of semantic web services. Since alignment spaces are structured by actual alignments, an alignment space measure is indeed
reflecting to some extent the capacity to translate ontology expressions. Such measures
are as useful as they can be computed quickly with respect to a particular query or
formula. On the other hand, distances in an ontology space only provide a measure of
closeness, and an alignment or a mediator remains to be produced.

In addition, even if ontologies are available, such measures may be useful as approximations of the real distance which are easier to compute than comparing the
ontologies: alignment-based measures can quickly provide a hint on what are the most
promising options. Indeed, because they already provide the structure to compute the
measure, alignments are faster to compare than elaborate comparison of two ontologies
as a whole.

In this paper we investigate the design of proximity measures in alignment spaces.
We introduce two families of measures and evaluate them with regard to other measures
in ontology spaces. We show that some of these are worth considering.

In the remainder, we first briefly consider the work designed for measuring a distance
or a similarity between ontologies (2) showing that it is exclusively based on the content of ontologies. We then provide general definitions about ontologies, alignments and
similarities (3). This introduces alignment spaces. We then define two families of alignment space measures: measures based on paths (4) and measures based on coverage
(5). Finally, we provide an experimental evaluation of these measures (6), showing in
particular that coverage-based measures behave comparably to the best ontology-based
measures and that they are reasonably robust to data alteration. Complements to this
work can be found in [3].

2 Related Works

Most of the work dealing with ontology measures [4,5,6] is in reality concerned with
concept distances. Such measures are widely used in ontology matching algorithms [2].
[4] introduced a concept similarity based on terminological and structural aspects of
ontologies. This very precise proposal combines an edit distance on strings and a structural distance on hierarchies (the cotopic distance). The ontology similarity strongly
relies on the terminological similarity. OLA [7] uses a concept similarity for ontology matching. This measure takes advantage of most of the ontological aspects (labels,
structure, extension) and selects the maximum similarity. It is thus a good candidate for
ontology similarity. The framework presented in [8] provides a similarity combining
string similarity, concept similarity  considered as sets  and similarity across usage
traces. [5] presents an elaborate framework for comparing concepts in a vector space
in which dimensions are primitive concepts. It is said to be extensible to ontologies as
well.

Finally, [6] more directly considered metrics evaluating ontology quality. This is
nevertheless one step towards semantic measures since they introduce normal forms for
ontologies which could be used for developing syntactically neutral measures.

These works generally rely on elaborate distance or similarity measures between
concepts and they extend these measures to distances between ontologies. This extension is often considered as straightforward, although, there are many ways to do so. In
[1], we have explicitly proposed and evaluated a collection of ontology distances and
similarities based on the comparison of the content of ontologies.

[9] investigated ontology agreement which is used as a measure for choosing compatible ontologies. It can be seen as another kind of distance or similarity between
ontologies. However, the way agreement/disagreement is computed is still based on ontology content; alignments are only used for identifying connected entities which are
not immediately comparable, hence they are neutral. Link frequency  inverse dataset
frequency [10] is a popularity measure which relies on references between datasets.
Although it does not consider explicitly alignments and is not meant to be a similarity,
it uses techniques related to our coverage-based measures.

The present paper provides and evaluates measures which, contrary to all the cited
ones, are based on alignments between ontologies, hence the term alignment space.

3 Ontologies, Alignment Spaces and Similarities

In this section, we introduce the ingredients which will be used for defining alignment
space measures: ontologies and alignments, alignment spaces and finally the notion of
similarity.

3.1 Ontologies and Alignments

We will use very simple definitions of ontologies and alignments. In particular, we will
consider an ontology o represented as a set of named entities QL(o). These entities
could be classes (C), properties (P ) or individuals (I): QL(o) = C  P  I.

Alignments express correspondences between entities belonging to different ontolo-
gies. Here we will only use a simplified version of alignments; a more complete definition and discussion can be found in [2]. Simple alignments contain correspondences
in which entities are the ontology vocabulary and the relations between entities are
equivalence (=) or subsumption (,).

Definition 1 (Simple alignment). Given two ontologies o and o
is a set of triples e, e
 e  QL(o) and e
 r  {=,,}.
The correspondence e, e

Example 1. In Figure 1, the alignments are as follows:

A1,2 is {a1, a2, =,b1, b2, =,c1, c2, =}
A1,3 is {d1, d3, =,e1, e3, =}
A2,3 is {c2, c3, =,d2, d3,,e2, e3,}
A2,4 is {a2, a4, =,b2, b4, =,c2, c4, =}
A3,4 is {c3, c4, =,d3, d4, =,e3, e4, =}

We use the notation A(s) for the action of replacing any ontology entity of a set of entities s by the term it is in correspondence through A if any (otherwise, the entity is simply
skipped). More precisely, the replacement is performed if there is a unique correspondence for each entity in s with a relation belonging to a set of relations . Depending on
the task for which the measure is performed  may be different. For instance, if the task
is to transform a query, then taking  = {=} provides exact transformations. However,
if completeness is not a concern but correctness is, using  = {=,} provides more
options for transforming entities which remain correct (because it selects a subclass of
the initial one). This is the value of  used in the examples.

Definition 2 (Application of an alignment). Given A a functional alignment, i.e., an
alignment in which each entity appears at most once,  a set of relations and s a set of
ontology entities, the application of A to s denoted by A(s) is1:

A(s) = {e

|!e, e

, r  A such that e  s  r  }

and =1 is =. For instance, A
for converting queries from o3 to o2.

3.2 Alignment Space

We call alignment space a set of ontologies and a set of alignments between these
ontologies. Measuring proximity in a frozen alignment space allows for grounding the
measure on actual alignments instead of non existing potential alignments.
Definition 3 (Alignment space). An alignment space ,  is made of a set  of
ontologies and a set  of simple alignments between ontologies in . We denote as
(o, o

) the set of alignments in  between o and o

An alignment space can be represented as a multigraph2 G, in which ontologies are
vertices and alignments are edges. Figure 2 (left) represents the graph corresponding to
the alignments and ontologies of Figure 1.
1 The notation ! stands for there exists a unique.
2 A multigraph is needed, because there may be several alignments available between two

ontologies.

A3,4)

It is possible to define the operation of inverse of an alignment (

1), composition
of two consecutive alignments () and union of two alignments between the same ontologies () [11]. The inverse, composition or union closure of an alignment space is
obtained by applying these operations to all possible (pairs of) alignments within the
space until they do not generate any new alignments. The semantics of a closed space
is the same as the initial space.

A path is simply defined as a path in G,.

A2,4, A1,3  A3,4, A1,2  A2,3  A3,4 and A1,3  A
We extend the notation A(s) to paths. If  = A1  . . . An, then || = n and (s) =
An(. . . A1(s) . . . ).
Definition 5 (Application of a path). Given  = A1  . . . An a functional path,  a set
of relations and s a set of ontology entities, the application of  to s denoted by (s) is:

2,3  A2,4.

(s) = {en|i!ei1, ei, r  Ai such that e0  s  r  }

By convention, we introduce the empty path 	 from one ontology to itself, such that
	(s) = s and |	| = 0. We note o   if o is one of the ontologies involved in an alignment
of the path . There may be an infinite number of paths due to circuits in the graph.

3.3 Algebraic Similarity Properties

We consider ontology measures which are functions from two ontologies to a scalar
domain. We use the term measure for both similarities and dissimilarity. A similarity
is a a real positive function  of two ontologies which is as large as ontologies are
similar. It is defined as follows.
Definition 6 (Similarity). A similarity  :     R is a function from a pair of
entities to a real number expressing the similarity between two objects such that:

o, o

)  0
  , (o, o
o  ,o
  , (o, o)  (o
?

?

?
)
, o
, o
o, o
  , (o, o
) = (o

, o)

(positiveness)
(maximality)
(symmetry)

Some authors consider a non symmetric (dis)similarity [12]; we then use the term non
symmetric measure or pre-similarity. All the measures presented in this paper are presimilarities and labelled as such. However, if applied to a symmetrically closed space,
they become similarities.

Very often, the measures are normalised. This is especially useful when the dissimilarity of different kinds of entities must be compared. Reducing each value to the same
scale in proportion to the size of the considered space is the common way to normalise.

Definition 7 (Normalised measure). A measure is said to be normalised if it ranges
over the unit interval of real numbers [0 1].

We consider only normalised measures and assume that a measure between two ontologies returns a real number between 0 and 1.

In the remainder, we define measures based on the structure of alignment spaces instead of relying directly on the ontology content. A first approach, considers alignment
spaces as graphs and the proximity between ontologies is based on their topology (4).
Another family of measures is based on the capacity of alignments to cover a large
proportion of the ontology entities as well as to keep them distinct (5).

4 Path-Based Measures

The first kind of similarity between two ontologies may be based on paths between
these ontologies in the graph G,. In fact, the existence of a path guarantees that it
is possible to transform queries from one ontology to another. This can be refined by
considering different values if the path is made of zero, one or several alignments:

and (o, o
and (o, o

) = 
) =  and (o, o

) = 

Definition 8 (Alignment path pre-similarity)

?

?
if o = o

2/3 if o = o

1/3 if o = o
?

?

?
otherwise

ap(o, o

) =
?

?

?
Example 4. From the alignment space of Figure 1, we can see that ap(o1, o2) = 2/3
because there is an alignment between o1 and o2, ap(o1, o4) = 1/3 because there are
paths between o1 and o4, and ap(o4, o1) = 1/3 because there are also paths using
inverse operations. All the values are given in Figure 2.

Such a measure is minimal between two non connected ontologies and it is normalised.
It is symmetric as long as alignments are considered symmetric, i.e., as soon as an
1 is available as well. It is relatively
alignment A is available, it is assumed that A
easy to compute and it reflects the possibility to propagate information between two
ontologies. However, it is not very precise in the number of transformations that may
have to be performed to propagate this information.

So, a natural measure depends on the shortest path in the graph G,. Indeed, the
fewer alignments are applied to a query, the more it is expected that it is an accurate
translation (in first approximation).

Definition 9 (Shortest alignment path pre-similarity). Given an alignment space
 
, , the shortest alignment path pre-similarity sap between two ontologies o, o

 is the complement to 1 of the length of the shortest path between o and o
in G,:
?

?

?
sap(o, o

) =

1  min(o,o ) ||

,

) = 

if (o, o
otherwise

In order to normalise the similarity, , can either be the size of ||, or the diameter
of G,, i.e., the length of the longest shortest path, plus 1.

Example 5. From the alignment space of Figure 1, if we take the size of the network as
(, = || = 5), sap(o1, o2) = 4/5 because there is an alignment between o1 and
o2 which is a path of length 1, sap(o1, o4) = 3/5 because the shortest path between
o1 and o4, e.g., through o2, is of length 2, and sap(o4, o1) = 3/5 because one can take
the converse of the previous path. All the values are given in Figure 2.

The computation of this measure is not significantly more expensive than the computation of the alignment path pre-similarity. The shortest alignment path pre-similarity is
more precise because it depends on the minimum necessary transformations between
the two ontologies.

However, an alignment between two ontologies can be just empty: this does not
mean that the ontologies are very close but rather that they are very different. Even
if alignments are not empty, this measure does not tell how much of an ontology is
preserved through the translation. Indeed, considering the alignment space of Figure 2,
it shows that for both measures, o4 is farther from o1 than o3, however, if one looks at the
alignments in Figure 1, the composition of A1,2 and A2,4 preserves more information
than the alignment A1,3. This is the reason why we consider more precise measures.

5 Coverage-Based Measures

If we want to go further in measuring the precise proximity for querying applications,
it may be useful to consider the ratio of elements of the ontology which are covered by

an alignment. In fact this can be applied to any set of elements, not just an ontology.
Hence the coverage can be given with regard to an ontology entity (the ratio is 1 or 0),
to a query or to an ontology. It corresponds to the percentage of entities which have an
image through the alignment.

Definition 10 (Alignment coverage). Given a set of ontology entities s over an ontology o, a set of relations , and an alignment A  (o, o
), the coverage of s by A is
given by:

|{e  s|e, e
?

?

?
cov(s, A) =

, r  A  r  }|
|s|

Example 6. In Figure 3, the coverage of alignment A04 is 2/3 because out of a, b and
c, only b and c are covered by the alignment.

There is a second important notion which is the ability for the alignment to preserve
the difference between entities which are deemed different in the source ontology. The
alignment distinguishability measure is the proportion of matched entities which are
kept distinct. This could be considered as preservation of information.

Definition 11 (Alignment distinguishability). Given a set of ontology entities s over
an ontology o, a set of relations , and an alignment A  (o, o
), the distinguishability
(or separability) of s by A is given by:

sep(s, A) =
?

?

?
|{e
, r  A  e  s  r  }|
|e, e
|{e  s|e, e, r  A  r  }|

Example 7. In Figure 3, the distinguishability of alignment A04 is 1/2 because out of
b and c covered by the alignment, there remain only one image in A04({b, c}).
For functional alignments, separability remains smaller than 1. These two notions are
obviously tied to the concepts of existence and injectivity of a function. cov depends
), hence these measures cannot be
on QL(o) alone, while sep also depends on QL(o
reduced to one another.

In the following, we use a measure which accounts for both coverage and distinguishability at once: instead of making the count of ontology entities which have an
image by the alignment, we only count those distinct images. Hence the lack of distinguishability automatically lowers the returned value.
?

?

?
Definition 12 (Alignment coverage distinguishability). Given a set of ontology entities s over an ontology o and an alignment A  (o, o
), the coverage distinguishability
of s by A is given by:

covdis(s, A) = cov(s, A)  sep(s, A) =

|A(s)|
|s|

Example 8. In Figure 3, the coverage distinguishability of alignment A04 is 1/3 because out of a, b and c, there remain only one image in A04({a, b, c}). Other examples,
are provided in Figure 3.

This measure can easily be extended to paths. If we still retain functional paths, the
relation between cov, sep and covdis of Definition 12 still holds for paths. Figure 3
shows the differences between the three measures.

5.1 Largest Coverage

The natural measure is that of largest coverage.
Definition 13 (Largest covering pre-similarity). Given an alignment space , ,
the largest covering pre-similarity lc between two ontologies o, o

   is

lc(o, o

) = max
A(o,o)

covdis(o, A)

Such a measure is clearly not symmetric, even if the alignment is only made of equal-
ities: the ratio depends on the size of the source ontology, independently of the target
ontology. It is not definite either: if all information is preserved and distinguishable, the
similarity will be 1 though the ontologies are not the same.

We have applied this measure to direct alignments and not to paths. However, it may
be that a path better covers and preserves the ontology entities than a direct alignment.
For instance, if there were a direct alignment A1,4 = {a1, a4, =} from o1 to o4.
Then the coverage would be 1/5, while the coverage provided by the path A1,2  A2,4
is 3/5. In that respect, o4 is closer to o1 than o3 is.

Hence, it is necessary to apply the measure to the paths which lead to an ontology.
Composing the measures obtained by the alignments in order to get the measure for the
path is not sufficient. Indeed, if two alignments have a similarity of 80%, the similarity

J. David, J. Euzenat, and O. Svab-Zamazal

of their compound alignment can be anything between 0% and 80%. We have computed
the product of the similarity as the lc in Table 1.

It is thus necessary to evaluate path coverage distinguishability. In order to address
this problem, we introduce measures which are based on path instead of simple align-
ments. The first one is the largest covering preservation pre-similarity:

Definition 14 (Largest covering preservation pre-similarity). Given an alignment
space , , the largest covering preservation pre-similarity lcp between two ontologies o, o

   is:

lcp(o, o

) = max
(o,o)

covdis(o, )

Example 9. From the alignment space of Figure 1, lcp(o1, o2) = 3/5 because over 5
entities in o1 the alignment A1,2 preserves 3, lcp(o1, o4) = 3/5 because the path A1,2
A2,4 between o1 and o4 also preserves the same 3 entities (other paths of Example 3
preserve less entities). This time lcp(o4, o1) = 3/8 because o4 contains 8 entities and
2,4  A
1
1
1,2 path preserves 3 entities. All the values of measures from o1 are given
the A
in Table 1.

5.2 Union Path Coverage

So far, we only considered that a query would take one path at a time and that the
query would be entirely evaluated through this path. In this case, the above measure
is perfectly accurate. However, very often a query is split into parts which are sent to
different peers and the results are composed through join or union depending on the
query.

In this case, the measure above does not reflect the semantics of alignment spaces
and does not provide a measure of the proximity of the two ontologies for evaluating
queries. The meaning of alignment spaces can basically be rendered by the transitive
and union closure of this alignment space3. In consequence, the coverage distinguishability should be computed not on the path that brings the maximal coverage but on the
coverage provided by the combination of all the possible paths.

Definition 15 (Union path coverage pre-similarity). Given an alignment space
, , the union path coverage upc between two ontologies o, o

   is:
?

?

?
|(

upc(o, o

) =

(o,o) )(s)|

|s|

The set of paths, eventually containing cycles, may be infinite; but what they preserve
of s is necessarily finite, hence a finite subset of these paths is sufficient for computing
upc.

This measure takes full advantage of all the alignments provided within the alignment space. In particular, it is able to account for the fact that, in the example of
Figure 1, any query expressed with regard to entities of ontology o1 can be evaluated in
ontology o4, yet through different paths depending on the considered entities.

3 We assume here that this alignment space is consistent.
?

?

?
Example 10. From the alignment space of Figure 1, upc(o1, o2) = 4/5 because over 5
entities in o1 the alignment A1,2 preserves 3 but in addition the path A1,3A
1
2,3 preserves
d1. upc(o1, o4) = 1 because the path A1,2  A2,4 between o1 and o4 also preserves the
same 3 entities and the path A1,3  A3,4 preserves the two remaining ones. This time
2,4  A
1

upc(o4, o1) = 5/8 because out of the 8 entities in o4, the A

1,3 preserves two other ones. All the values of measures from o1
are given in Table 1.

5.3 OntoSim
OntoSim is a Java library for computing distance or similarity measures between on-
tologies4. It can be used by other tools, such as matchers, through its API.

OntoSim implements the measures described in [1] and here. The alignment space
measures presented here usually rely on the sets of paths between two nodes in a graph
which is a highly complex problem (the number of acyclic paths being n! in a complete graph). However, because we have a quantity to optimise (the degree of cover-
age), this provides a ground for implementing branch-and-bound strategies (even for
the union path coverage). In addition, we have developed a focussed search heuristics aiming at maximising the potentially preserved coverage (preservation can only
decrease monotonously). Both approaches put together are really efficient in practice.

6 Comparison of Presented Measures

In order to better understand how these measures behave, we have performed experi-
ments. These experiments follow those comparing measures in ontology spaces on the
ontology alignment evaluation initiative (OAEI) benchmark ontologies [1]. They especially offered a separate evaluation of entity similarity measures and set similarity
measures. The following experiment compares ontology space measures and alignment
space measures on the OntoFarm data set (OAEI conference data set). Two experiments
have been carried out for evaluating respectively the agreement between different measures and the robustness of alignment space measures.

6.1 Dataset Description
There are very few datasets available which have the structure of an alignment space:

15 ontologies dealing with the conference organisation domain. Ontologies are based
upon three types of underlying resources:

 actual conference (series) and its web pages,
 actual software tool for conference organisation support,
 experience of people with personal participation in organisation of actual

conference.

This dataset has been used several times in the OAEI evaluation campaigns. We have
used those of 2009. For the experiment purpose, we have used a set of 105 alignments
obtained as a majority vote between 7 matchers (Aroma, ASMOV, DSSim, Falcon, Lily,
OLA, TaxoMap). We have suppressed empty alignments, resulting in 91 alignments
containing 827 correspondences. Alignments are non-oriented: they can be traversed in
both ways.

6.2 Agreement
The first experiment aims at comparing rank correlation between measures. Its goal is
to compare if the proximity orders induced by alignment space measures can be correlated with the proximity orders induced by ontology space measures. We compare the
alignment space measures with the measures that have been found the best in our previous study [1]. JaccardVM and CosineVM are measures between vectors determined
by the terms used to describe entities in both ontologies, EntityLexicalMeasure computes a similarity between entities from their annotations, e.g., labels and comments,
and extract a similarity between ontologies, while TripleBasedEntitySim compares entities on the basis of the RDF triples that involve them and extract a similarity between
ontologies.

We use the standard Kendall b rank correlation for computing the correlation between compared measures. In these experiments, the significance test at level of 5%
gives a confidence interval of [0.09; 0.09].
Agreement results. The resulting agreement is shown in Table 2 using the Kendall b
correlation coefficient [14]. It ranges between 1 and 1, hence all these measures are
correlated to some extent.

More interesting information is found when using these data for clustering the measures with respect to their agreement. Hierarchical clustering from agreement provides
the dendrogram of Figure 4 (we have used single linkage, but the other linkage measures
give the same results).

The two path measures, i.e., ap and sap, do not agree with other measures. This
can be easily explained because the graph of alignments is very connected (91 alignments out of 105 possible ones) so these measures are not very informative: the ontologies come in few groups depending on how they are connected to the others, most
of them being reachable through one alignment. This is not discriminating enough and
it is penalised by the b variant. As expected, this shows that these measures are very
dependent on the topology of the alignment space.

The most interesting aspect of this test is that coverage-based measures, i.e., lcp
and upc, are far more correlated with the content based measures than to the pathbased measures. They are even more correlated to the vector-space measures than the

agreement)

vector space measures agree with the entity-based measures. This is a very good sign
especially that in our previous experiments we saw that JaccardVM and TripleBasedEntitySim were the best ontology space measures. This shows that these measures, which
do not have access to the content of ontologies, are meaningful with regard to this
content.

6.3 Robustness

The second experiment focuses on robustness of alignment space measures. For that
purpose, alignment spaces are altered in a systematic manner. We have retained two
variants for this degradation:
variant 1: Randomly remove n% of alignments in an alignment space
variant 2: Randomly remove n% of correspondences in all alignments

J. David, J. Euzenat, and O. Svab-Zamazal

The experiment consisted of evaluating, for each measure, the agreement between the
alignment space measure without degradation and the same measure computed on the
altered alignment space. This experiment has been done with several levels of degrada-
tion, from 10% to 100% with a step of 10%. Since this procedure is based on random
degradation, we repeated it 10 times for each level and averaged the results.

Agreement is still measured by the Kendall b rank correlation between the measure
obtained on the initial alignment space and that obtained on the degraded alignment
space.

For the second variant, we only compare the two coverage measures because this
type of degradation has no impact on path measures since it preserves the topology of
alignment spaces.

We expect that the degradation obtained with the first variant will have a more nega-

tive impact on the robustness of measures.

Results of Variant 1. Results of this first variant are given in Figure 5 (left). Path-based
measures do not have good results for the same reason as before: the graph being very
connected, most ontologies are at the same distance to one another, then the b coefficient penalises this behaviour. Still the correlation remains positive (0 means random).
Coverage-based measures have a linearly decreasing curves. This result shows the
strong dependency of all these measures on available alignments. Both measures are
very close, and indeed, we have observed this in other experiments as well.

Results of Variant 2. Results of the second variant are given in Figure 5 (right). Both
measures show a sub-linear degradation: this shows that they are quite robust to correspondence degradation. We replicated these experiments with different datasets, different modus operandi and different agreement measures. The results are the same with
a different amplitude of the robustness to the correspondence degradation (which is

sometimes better and sometimes worse than the one observed here, but always more
resistant than linear).

Results of lcp (degree of agreement with non-degraded variant) seems higher, therefore we can conclude that it is less dependent on particular correspondences (this does
not mean that they are better, just more robust).

The robustness tests show that alignment space measures are indeed correlated with
the quality of the alignment space (so they are not random measures). In both cases,
the measures are rather robust since their agreement with their initial behaviour decreases less than the degradation. The coverage-based measures shows some independence from correspondences degradation.

7 Conclusion

We have introduced a new way to measure similarity between ontologies adapted to a
context in which alignments are available, such as the semantic web or semantic peer-
to-peer systems [15]. Such measures rely on the available alignments instead of the
content of the ontologies. They are useful when some ontologies are not available or
when the proximity must denote the ability to transfer information from one ontology
to another.

We have defined precisely some possible such measures. Path-based measures take
into account the topology of alignment spaces. Coverage-based measures are based
on the coverage and distinguishability of alignments and can account for combined
alignment paths for transforming queries. This allows global reasoning on alignments
alone which is something less easy in local environments.

The proposed measures have been implemented in the OntoSim library and compared to measures taking advantage of ontology content in order to detect similarity.
Although not strongly correlated with the best measures, the coverage-based measures
provide results comparable to these. Moreover, in addition to not depend on the ontology content, they have proved to be reasonably robust to errors in the alignments,
especially if individual correspondences are missing. This is very encouraging.

The proposed measures have been designed with simplifying hypotheses that requires further investigation in order to relax them. This mostly concerns taking into
account different alignment relations and alignment confidence, in the style of [11], as
well as considering more closely non functional alignments. It would also be interesting
to look further into the joint use of ontology space and alignment space measures.
