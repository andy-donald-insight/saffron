Abstract. Dialogue interaction between customers and products improves presentation of relevant product information in in-store shopping
situations. Thus, information needs of customers can be addressed more
intuitive. In this article, we describe how access to product information
can be improved based on dynamic linkage of heterogeneous knowledge
representations. We therefore introduce a conceptual model of dialogue
interaction based on multiple knowledge resources for in-store shopping
situations and empirically test its utility with end-users.

Keywords: heterogeneous knowledge resources, dynamic linkage, dialogue interaction, ontology, empirical study.

1 Introduction

What if you could find a product that directly matches your personal preferences by posing a simple question on your mobile device? Today, customers in
bricks-and-mortar stores often lack access to helpful product information from
the Web, such as product manuals, user and professional reviews or feature
comparisons. On the other hand, those customers that have in-store Web access
by their mobile device may suffer from information overload due to the sheer
quantity of product information available. We therefore investigate how to enable customers access to comprehensive, helpful product information in physical
shopping environments. In this context, we further study the filtering and intuitive presentation of such product information in form of dialogue interaction
between customer and product. The use of product-centered dialogue systems
in physical shopping environments enables an improved filtering and presentation of relevant product information [1] and thus satisfy the communication
needs of customers as intuitive as possible. To realize such natural language
communication between customers and physical products, dialogue systems and
comprehensive knowledge representations are necessary [2]. But, knowledge resources around products suffer from heterogeneous nature and diverse semantics,
e.g., product descriptions by several manufacturers, user and professional reviews
on the web, explanations of product features by diverse providers, pricing and
bundling information of specific portals. Here, we assume that product-centered

dialogue interaction requires bundling of these product-related knowledge resources and their dynamic linkage at a specific hot spot for instance a web
service. In this paper, we therefore introduce a conceptual model of dynamic
linkage of product-related knowledge resources within dialogue interaction in instore shopping situations. By means of the resulting dialogue system prototype,
we evaluate the utility of dialogue interaction based on heterogeneous knowledge resources from an end-user perspective. The focus of this contribution lies
on the bundling of diverse heterogeneous knowledge resources, e.g., digital product descriptions, at a specific hot spot that enables not only standardized
access to different types of information but also the dynamic linkage of these resources within in-store dialogue interaction. The rest of this paper is organized
as follows. We will discuss related work in Sec. 2. Afterwards, our motivation
will be illustrated by an example. In Sec. 4, the approach of bundling diverse
heterogeneous knowledge resources is described with a focus on digital product
descriptions. We then present our model of dynamic linkage of product-related
knowledge resources within dialogue interaction for in-store shopping situations
(Sec. 5). Finally, we show and evaluate an implementation of the model from an
end-user perspective in Sec. 6, summarize our results and provide an outlook on
future work (Sec. 7).

2 Related Work

In our work, dialogue interaction between customers and physical products in
in-store shopping environments refers to the application of dialogue systems
in physical environments and the usage of ontologies as knowledge represen-
tations. Dialogue systems provide the opportunity to interact with a system
similar to human-human communication [3]. They can be divided into two basic
types: dialogue grammars and frames as well as plan-based and collaborative
systems. Dialogue grammars identify and represent surface patterns of dialogue
or speech acts. Frame-based approaches extend grammars regarding their flexi-
bility. Plan-based and collaborative systems assume that humans communicate
to achieve goals and thus, focus on intentional structures [4]. When designing
Natural Language Processing (NLP) modules, there are two extremes: full natural language processing or fixed linguistic question templates. A sweet spot
between the two extremes is to constrain natural language in order to create a
formal, user-friendly query language [5] or a controlled language for posing questions [6]. There are diverse examples for current dialogue systems, for instance
SmartKom - a multimodal dialogue system that combines speech, gesture and
mimics input [7] as well as DELFOS, an dialogue manager system that enables
the integration of OWL ontologies as external knowledge resources for dialogue
systems [8]. The combination of NLP and ontologies facilitates the development
of novel dialogue systems that use ontologies as a core knowledge component
regarding linguistic and non-linguistic knowledge representations. In our case,
product information as part of the non-linguistic knowledge base plays an important role. The effective handling of this heterogeneous product knowledge
?

?

?
distributed among various steps in the product lifecycle has become essential
[9]. Meanwhile, there are several ontology-based developments that address the
description of products. For instance, Product Design Ontology (AIM@SHAPE
project) focuses on the formalization of knowledge concerning processes, tools
and shapes during product development whereas other ontologies as GoodRelations [10] and SearchMonkey Product (by Yahoo!) are used to annotate digital
products and service offerings on the web. An ontology within NLP constitutes
the conceptualized description of the domain of the dialogue system [11]. We
assume that NLP benefits from the appliance of semantic knowledge representations as well as semantic technologies, e.g., SWRL, in general. In the current
work, dialogue interaction requires the generation of situation-specific questions
and answers on run-time. Multiple pieces of information have to be combined
while answering questions that are not anticipated at the time of system construction [12]. The important role of the combination of language technologies,
ontology engineering and machine learning is also described by Buitelaar et al.
[13]. The semantic web technologies and standards will be used for the specification of web-based, standardized language resources. However, building ontologies
in the first place requires experienced knowledge engineers [12]. The linkage of
multiple ontology-based knowledge resources pose a challenge concerning the
combination of knowledge of different resources and the answering of queries by
considering multiple resources [14]. On the other hand, the effort of building up
the knowledge base of the dialogue system can be decreased or sourced out. Fur-
thermore, the coverage of dialogue systems is extended by integrating knowledge
of multiple resources as it will be described in the current work [15,14].

3 Motivation

The motivation for dialogue interaction in in-store shopping situations shall be
described by a futuristic example of a sales talk. A customer enters a drugstore
because she searches for a whitening toothpaste. She carries a smart phone that
is also used to request additional information about products. She wants to take
a look at the toothpastes that are right for her. She scans the barcode of a
toothpaste with her smart phone to identify the product and poses the following
question: Which whitening toothpastes are available? The toothpaste answers
via mobile device: There are three whitening toothpastes available: StarLight,
Smile and WhiteSky. You can find it on the second floor. If you prefer, somebody
will get it for you. Customer: Yes, please. Toothpaste: Are you interested in
a video clip that explains the application of toothpaste StarLight? Customer:
Why not! A corresponding clip is shown on a display nearby. Customer: Very
good. Which mouthwashes fit to this toothpaste? Toothpaste: The best options
are these two. Both are shown on her mobile device. Toothpaste: If you buy
this toothpaste and one of these mouthwashes you will get a 5% discount.
Customer: Thats a good deal. The example has shown complex relationships
between customers, manufacturers, products and product-related knowledge. We
will depict these relationships in the next section.

4 Handling Clouds of Product-Centered Knowledge

Resources

In shopping environments, product-related knowledge is retrieved from different
sources that use different semantics. Primarily, we speak about digital product
descriptions that represent the informational basis to realize a customer-product
dialogue. Currently, physical products are described non-standardized or standardized in terms of static databases (e.g., STEP ISO 10303 [16]) or XML structures (e.g., BMEcat: bmecat.org). Furthermore, product-centered knowledge resources also cover comparisons of products as well as their features. On the one
hand, this information is provided by single manufacturer web sites exclusively
considering their own products, e.g., Apple, Dell. On the other hand, consumer
portals, e.g. Ciao! (ciao.co.uk), allocates comparisons of products manufactured
by different companies. Further product-centered knowledge types are definitions or explanations of product features. Regarding the complexity of physical
products, some features require explanations to enable customers to make confident purchase decisions. Currently, such explanations are available via diverse
websites of manufacturers, search engines such as Google or online encyclopedias such as Wikipedia. In addition, the example in Sec. 3 shows the integration of pricing and product bundling information within the customer-product
dialogue. Knowledge about matching products is provided by manufacturers exclusively concerning their own assortment as well as by shopping portals, e.g.,
Amazon, based on collaborative filtering mechanisms according to the principle
customers who bought this item also bought [...]. Pricing information on the
web rarely exceed the scope of comparisons between retailing portals, for instance provided by ConsumerSearch (consumersearch.com). However, dynamic
prices or discount bargains against dynamic parameters like customer type, current situation or inventory are not available. Finally, the aforementioned example
presents a natural language dialogue between customer and product. Such dialogue interaction requires question-answering structures represented by linguistic knowledge resources. Currently, such linguistic knowledge resources are not
freely accessible on the web. This short overview points out that there is a cloud
of product-centered knowledge resources on the web, all of different semantics
and formats. How can these cloudy information structures be integrated into
a purposeful customer-product dialogue? In the following subsections, we will
elaborate our approach for bundling such heterogeneous knowledge resources at
a specific hot spot that enables standardized access to these different types
of information. At this point, we focus on the handling of different formats of
digital product descriptions as they represent essential product knowledge of
each physical product. Finally, digital product descriptions build the basis for
the calculation of dynamic prices [17] as well as product bundling results [18].

4.1 Digital Product Information in Physical Environments

BMEcat). Modeling enterprises or business processes is generally sophisticated
(e.g., Business Process Modeling Notation: bpmn.org), but the description of
products rarely exceeds the scope of classification. Furthermore, the effort in
maintenance and extension of such product descriptions is high. So, product information is often incomplete or out-of-date. As product descriptions of diverse
physical products in shopping environments serve as basis for our customerproduct dialogue, we have to handle the different formats of these descriptions
(cf. Fig.1). We developed a mapping module that enables the automatic mapping
of diverse XML-based product description formats into a standardized semantic product description structure - Smart Product Description Object (SPDO)
- and vice versa. The web-based SPDO mapping interface is able to retrieve
initial product description data from diverse servers, e.g., repositories of man-
ufacturers. Afterwards, each product description is mapped automatically onto
the core model of the SPDO structure. In case of imprecise relations between the
concepts of the initial product description and SPDO structure, the web-based
mapper interface allows the manual arrangement of concepts by the user. SPDO
represents semantic and dynamic product information. It is a product ontology for physical products in in-store shopping environments [19]. As shown in
Fig. 1, SPDO consists of a core model1 and SPDO specific extension plugins
both formalized in OWL-DL. The further covers prototypical aspects of consumer products which is all domain-independent information of the product
itself, e.g., name, color, price, manufacturer etc. Domain-specific conceptualiza-
tions, more precisely product information regarding specific product domains,
can be imported into SPDO as extension plugins, for instance cosmetics2, drugs
or fashion plugins. While mapping the original description of a physical product
to SPDO structure, an instance of SPDO is generated. That is, each product description is transformed into one instantiated SPDO file formalized in OWL-DL
(SPDO Pool)(cf. Fig.1). When we consider our in-store shopping environment,
we can say that each physical product is then described by one SPDO instance.
At the beginning of this subsection, we mentioned that product descriptions are

often incomplete or out-of-date because of high effort in maintenance and extension of such data. In order to address this issue, SPDO enables dynamic and
automatic data extension and maintenance. Underspecified relations or concepts
can be completed automatically with reasoning mechanisms. Therefore, product
information based on SPDO will be extended by application of rules. A repository of web-based rules (SWRL3) enables the generation and integration of
statements about alternative or matching products into SPDO instances, more
precisely the processing of specific rules combines product descriptions automatically in real-time according to parameters that can be configured dynamically,
for instance color A fits to color B. As a result, an advanced and automatic
processing in terms of updates and extensions is possible that forces the emergence of dynamically changing product networks.

4.2 Bundling the Product-Centered Knowledge Cloud

The network of SPDOs is one part of the product-centered knowledge cloud that
needs to be processed to realize an intuitive representation of comprehensive
product information in form of dialogue interaction. Fig. 2 shows our approach
for bundling heterogeneous knowledge resources at a hot spot to enable standardized access to different types of product-centered knowledge. Besides SPDO
Pool, we assume that following heterogeneous knowledge resources have to be
bundled at a hot spot (cf. top layer in Fig. 2):

 Product-centered knowledge requested by external services is used to extend
SPDOs, e.g., integration of explanations of specific product features or product reviews. Furthermore, external services like accessible thesauri or search
engines are requested for linguistic information to extend the lexicon of the
linguistic knowledge representation, e.g., adequate articles, plural forms of
nouns etc.

 Currently, linguistic knowledge representations that match our needs regarding dialogue interaction in in-store shopping environments are not freely accessible on the web. We developed a light-weight linguistic knowledge representation formalized in OWL-DL that represents the structural backbone of
dialogue interaction between customers and physical products. This knowledge resource will be elaborated in detail in the next section.

 The repository of web-based rules covers rules regarding matching or alternative products as well as rules concerning dynamic bundle prices and
discounts. Rules are applied on SPDO Pool and provide results that are
integrated in dialogue interaction.

 Sales and inventory figures of manufacturers or retailers represent large economic data resources that should be processed within a dialogue between
customer and product. So, retailers are able to offer slow sellers in the context of matching products or allow dynamic discounts dependent on sales
figures.

Fig. 2. Approach of bundling product-centered knowledge resources

These heterogeneous knowledge resources are bundled by a semantic mediator (cf. middle layer of Fig. 2) that represents the hot spot for generating a
consistent knowledge stream based on resources of different semantics and for-
mats. The semantic mediator consists of several modules that are responsible
for requesting and processing diverse knowledge resources as well as allocating preliminary results. We discern internal (marked light grey) and interface
modules (marked dark grey) (cf. Fig. 2). Internal modules generate preliminary
results and forward these results to interface modules which directly contribute
to the consistent knowledge stream. The semantic mediator contains two internal modules: Extension Module and Inference Module. The Extension Module
requests knowledge from external services, e.g. definitions of product features via
Wikipedia, and integrates this content into SPDOs or the linguistic knowledge
representation. The second internal module - the Inference Module processes
rules of the web-based rule repository and offers rule-based results to the Pricing and Product Bundling Module. Furthermore, Fig. 2 shows the following
interface modules:

 Product Knowledge Broker Module processes product information stored in
the SPDO Pool and induct this knowledge into the consistent knowledge
stream.

 NLP Module processes the linguistic knowledge representation and allocates

linguistic question-answer structures to realize dialogue interaction.

S. Janzen et al.

 Pricing Module receives rule-based results from internal Inference Module

as well as economic data and therefore calculates dynamic prices.

 Product Bundling Module processes sales and inventory figures of economic
data as much as the Pricing Module. By merging economic data with rulebased results, matching or alternative product bundles are generated.

All described interface modules induct their processing results into the consistent knowledge stream whereas the semantic mediator coordinates linkage of
the diverse results as well as alignment of knowledge offerings with the needs
of the ongoing customer-product dialogue. The bottom layer of Fig. 2 shows
the physical shopping environment consisting of customer, physical products
and a mobile communication interface, e.g., the customers mobile. All physical products are described by one SPDO instance, respectively. The mobile
communication interface enables the dialogue interaction between customer and
product. It represents an access point to the product-centered knowledge cloud
and enables the customer to construct natural language questions term-by-term
via choosing questions segments (written mode). Additionally, the customer is
able to pose her question verbally (spoken mode). Afterwards, the mobile communication interface presents the generated answers with text and images. On
technical level, the semantic mediator is implemented in TNT2 [20] - an OSGi
(osgi.org) based middleware for mobile recommendation agents in physical envi-
ronments. The NLP Module is realized by the Conversational Recommendation
Agent (CoRA) [21] that constitutes an OSGi plugin of TNT2. Furthermore, the
client of the mobile communication interface was exemplarily developed on an
Android (android.com) based mobile phone.

5 Linkage of Heterogeneous Knowledge Resources for

Dialogue Interaction

Now, we know how to bundle heterogeneous knowledge resources based on a semantic mediator. But how can we dynamically merge these knowledge resources
for the generation of answers of a dialogue interaction system? We want to generate situation-specific questions and answers for a dialogue at run-time that
means questions and answers depend on concrete physical products in physical shopping situations with a specific context. These generation processes rely
on the dynamic integration of heterogeneous knowledge resources. In detail, for
answering queries by the user multiple external information resources are considered automatically. The integration of these external resources decrease the
effort of building up knowledge representations for dialogue systems. In Fig. 3,
we present a model of dynamic linkage of heterogeneous knowledge resources
for dialogue interaction. In this contribution, we focus on the linkage of product
information from SPDO Pool with linguistic structures of the linguistic knowledge representation, because the NLP and Product Knowledge Broker module
constitute the conceptual basis for dialogue interaction. The right part of Fig. 3
shows the conceptual design of the linguistic knowledge representation that represents the linguistic structures of the NLP approach [21]. The representation
