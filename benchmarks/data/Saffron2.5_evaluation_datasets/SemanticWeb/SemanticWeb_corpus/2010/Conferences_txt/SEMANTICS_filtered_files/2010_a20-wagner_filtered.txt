ABSTRACT
The current business model of online newspapers is to create
content and publish it on the Web. Content in turn attracts
users to the online presence of a newspaper. This attention
of users is monetized by presenting advertisements to them.
The revenue of online content providers is mainly generated
by advertisement and strongly depends on the number of
users consuming their content.

Therefore - in general - content providers aim to attract
as many users as possible with their content. However, to
a large extent content providers make their content only
available on one individual site in an unstructured form and
consequently limit the accessibility and reusability of their
content. Several reasons for this exist, among them are the
way news have been published in the past, intellectual property rights and the way advertisements are currently sold.

In this paper we inspect the current situation of online
newspapers and propose solutions for the current dilemma
of content providers. We illustrate how Semantic Web technologies can help content providers to open their content,
i.e. making their content reusable and integrable for third
parties, without loss in revenue.

INTRODUCTION

In recent years the Web has been undergoing a dramatic
change. The concept of Web 2.0 [5] summarizes several perceived changes on the Web, which have led, amongst oth-
ers, to the emergence of innovative mash-up applications
aggregating and combining content and data from different
sources. As described in our previous work [8] the Content Republishing phenomenon, which can be observed on
the Web 2.0, boosts diffusion and dissemination of content.
Users may republish content by reblogging external content
on their blogs, by retweeting microblog posts from other
users on their own microblog or by posting external content to their Facebook1 wall. Content becomes increasingly
separated from individual sites and can be reused and re-
combined, providing new value for content consumers.

Professional online content providers, such as online news-
portals, are very present on the Web since its early days
and utilize it as one medium to publish their content. At
present, to a large extent professional online content providers only publish their content on dedicated Web sites, most
notably on their own ones. To successfully operate their
business, they provide advertisements, acquired by themselves or taken from third parties (e.g. Google), embedded
in their content. To determine the attractiveness for potential advertising customers online news providers measure
the usage of their site by using Web analytics tools. These
tools allow to record and analyze usage statistics on a very
detailed level. As a rule of thumb the more users are attracted to an online portal, the higher the attractiveness for
an advertiser, because more people can be reached by an
advertising campaign. Therefore the amount of displayed
advertisement directly influences the revenue of content pro-
viders, while usage statistics influence it indirectly.

Subsequently, content providers aim to reach and inform
as many users as possible by the help of their content. But
at present, they limit accessibility and reusability of their

single site, most notably on their own. Unfortunately, by
doing so, they are not able to benefit from potential crossmonetarization effects, as they are unwilling to disseminate
their content. Currently, there is a lack of feasibility to
measure content dissemination to make the increased reach
transparent to advertising customers. Therein results the
dilemma of content providers.

In this paper we discuss Semantic Web technology oriented solutions to address the dilemma of content providers
and to illustrate how professional online content providers
can exploit new possibilities emerging through the recent
paradigm shift of the Web. In Section 2 we introduce current models for online advertising and methods for the reuse
of content on the Web. Section 3 provides a detailed description of the current dilemma of commercial content providers
and Section 4 proposes approaches for solving the previously
described problems. Finally, we relate our work with existing work in this area and draw conclusions for future work.

2. BACKGROUND

In this section we shed light on information that forms the
basis of our work. We introduce current models for online
advertising and methods for the reuse of content on the Web.
The information introduced here sets the foundations for
later sections.
2.1 Advertising based Business Models of on-

line Content Providers

At present revenue of online content providers is mainly
generated by advertisements and therefore is strongly dependent on the number of users consuming their content
and the advertisements.

The two most prominent advertising pricing models are:

1. Cost per impression (CPI) model:

The cost per impression model ensures that the content provider gets a certain amount of money from the
advertiser for having displayed an ad a certain amount
of times on his Web site. The advertisement profit depends on how often an ad is displayed and the price
the advertiser is willing to pay for an ad impression.
The most popular form of this advertising model is
classical banner advertising.

2. Cost per click (CPC) model:

The cost per click model demands that a visitor clicks
on an ad to visit the advertisers site. That means the
advertisement profit depends on the number of clicks
on an ad and the price the advertiser is willing to pay
for a click. The most popular and well known cost per
click advertising program is Google Adsense2.

In addition to the advertising pricing model also the adinfluences the advertisement rev-

vertising serving model
enue:

1. Advertisements are served directly by (or on behalf of)

the content provider:
If advertisements are directly served by the content
providers they can be either embedded statically into
the page or be loaded dynamically. In the later case

2http://www.google.com/adsense

advertisements can be loaded from local or remote
servers. Advertisement revenue is generated directly
by the content providers. If an external server is used
a (usually volume based) fee is paid for the usage of
the ad server.

2. Advertisements are served by third party services:

If third party services serve the advertisements they
are loaded dynamically to the site. Content providers embed certain tags as placeholder into their Web
pages. The appropriate advertisements are loaded dynamically from the ad server. The advertisement revenue is shared between advertiser and the content pro-
vider.

The two presented pricing models regulate the way money
is paid from the advertiser to the publisher. The technical
realization of ad serving does not depend on whether advertisements are billed by CPI or CPC models.
In terms
of technological realization the central difference is whether
the ad is embedded statically into the page or loaded dynamically from a local or remote server.
2.2 Content Reuse Methods

If content are reused across application boundaries we

must distinguish two different methods:

(1) Content Reuse by Value:

If content are copied by value two individual instances
of the same content item are generated.

An advantage of this traditional copy and paste mechanism is that instances of the same content item can
evolve independently from each other. However, the
biggest disadvantage of copying content by value is that
the content are not kept up to date. If the original content change the copied versions are not updated. Another disadvantage is that copyright statements often
prohibit copying content by value.

(2) Content Reuse by Reference (Transclusions):

Transclusions allow including existing content into documents without duplicating it. Content are copied by
reference and content values are fetched and reloaded
on demand. The concept of transclusions has originally
been introduced in the early 1960s by Ted Nelson.

Transclusions have several advantages compared with
traditional cut-and-paste mechanisms:
they allow for
keeping copied content up to date, avoiding copyright
problems and saving disk space [4]. As shown by [3] basic Web technologies such as plain HTML, JavaScript,
CGI scripts and a specialized HTTP proxy application
allow realizing transclusions on the Web.

The biggest disadvantage of transclusions is that for
textual content they never had their breakthrough and
never found wide adoption. Furthermore, if the document from where the transcluded content originates becomes unavailable, the compound document must handle the broken transclusion.

3. PROBLEM DEFINITION

In general content providers aim to reach and inform as
many users with their content as possible.
If they would
open their content, interlink it with other content and describe it semantically, third parties could aggregate and use


different sites, it could possibly attract more users and the
value and reach of content could increase. Content providers thus could reach more users by allowing third parties
(i.e. users, Web application developers, software agents) to
display and use their content.

However, at present content provider are forced to limit
the access to their content to their own sites because of the
following reasons:

1. Presenting advertisements: Currently widely used
advertising methods (see Section 2.1) force content
providers to keep their content locked on their sites,
because ads are bound to individual Web sites instead
of being bound directly to the content. Consequently
the revenue of content provider depends on users consuming content via their sites. Content providers cannot open their content to make them integrable and
reusable for third parties without a loss in revenue.

2. Licences: Parts of the content published by content
provider usually comes from third parties, such as press
agencies or photographers. Original intellectual property can be hold by editors that create content exclusively for a newspaper or by news agencies which
(pre-)produce content for several newsportals. This
content falls under limited licenses. Only online newspapers paying for the content are allowed to publish it
on their sites. Republishing by other sites is prohibited
by the license of the content.

3. Measuring attractiveness: The attractiveness of
online news sites for an advertiser is determined using performance indicators, such as page impressions,
unique clients, visits or use time. The page impressions
indicator shows how many pages where displayed in a
distinct period of time. The unique client factor indicates the reach of portal in terms of unique users. The
visits indicator summarizes how often users visited a
site and subsequently retrieved a set of pages. The use
time indicates how long an individual user has stayed
on a site during one visit.

All of these traditional performance indicators operate on a site level and not on a content bits or data
level. That means these indictors assume that digital
content bits are only published and consumed on one
individual site.

These contradicting factors cause the current dilemma of

content providers.

4. SOLUTION APPROACH

In this section we refer to the three problems which force
content providers to limit the access to their content (see
section 3) and show how Semantic Web technologies can be
used to address these problems.
4.1 Presenting Advertisements

Since content provider need a way to open and interlink
their content without loosing advertisement revenues, we
suggest to semantically annotate content (e.g. articles and
advertisement) published on a Web site to allow machines to
interpret the semantics of content and the relations between
them. Usage control policies allow controlling not only who

may access which content, but also how the content may or
may not be used afterwards [6]. Machine-interpretable usage
control policies can be used to expose, for example, that an
article can only be reused together with its advertisement.
Listing 1 shows an example of a semantically annotated
news site. The different resources (advertisement, article,
embedded video) that are displayed on the site and the relations between them are described. The article is an instance
of the class Post from the SIOC3 ontology and has certain
properties such as content, author and topic. The fact
that the article embeds a video is exposed by using the embeds property of the SIOC ontology which indicates that
a resources embeds external content (which may be related
with certain policies and licenses). The article is related
with an advertisement which is an instance of the class Ad
of our advertisement ontology by using the has_ad property.

An ad has the following properties:
 has_advertiser/advertiser_of: relates an ad with
an advertisement customer (instance of class Person
or Organization of the FoaF4 ontology) who is paying
for the ad

 advertises: relates an ad with a product (instance of
class ProductOrService of the GoodRelations5 ontol-
ogy) for which an advertisement is made

 code: relates and ad with its HTML and/or JavaScript

Listing 1: Semantic description of advertised con-
tent

To describe how resources can be used and reused we are
using the Open Digital Rights Language (ODRL6). ODRL
is a vocabulary which allows expressing terms and conditions over assets (Web resources which include any physical

which indicate the actions that a certain party (e.g. user,
role, group) is permitted to perform on a specific target asset
manifestation (i.e.
format) or a range of manifestations of
the target asset. Constraints may optionally constrain permissions and duties may indicate requirements that must be
fulfilled to receive a permission [1].

Listing 2 extends the example of listing 1 with usage policies which indicate that the video can only be reused i.e. be
aggregated, modified and extracted (permission) together
with the ad (duty). The meaning of permissions and duties
is defined by the ODRL data dictionary7.

Listing 2: Usage Policies binding ad to video

Specifying that a certain asset can only be reused together
with a certain ad allows content providers to separate their
content from their sites without loosing advertisement rev-
enues. Exposing this information in a machine-interpretable
way by using well defined semantics and agreed-upon ontologies is a crucial factor, because it allows third party applications (e.g. end-user tools such as reblogging tools or
mash-up creation tools such as Yahoo Pipes8 and Semantic
Web Pipes9) to interpret these policies.

If content are reused by copying content values, the content copying or aggregation tools must be able to interpret
policies and ensure that the copied version of the content is
also published under certain terms and conditions. If content are reused by reference (as transclusion) the proxy service which resolves the reference must be able to interpret
policies.
4.2 Licenses and Usage Restrictions

Since parts of the content published by content provider
usually comes from third parties, such as press agencies or

8http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/ (20.06.2009)
9http://pipes.deri.org/ (20.06.2009)

photographers, original intellectual property can be hold by
editors that created the content. Therefore content providers need a way to expose under which conditions what kind
of content usage is allowed. To address this problem we
again suggest the use of Semantic Web policies. With the
help of policies machines will be able to interpret if the permission to reuse a piece of content in a certain context is
given or not.

Listing 3 extends the example of listing 1 with usage policies which indicate that the article can only be displayed.
Content reuse actions, such as extractions, aggregations and
modifications, are explicitly prohibited by machine-interpretable
polices.

4.3 Measuring Attractiveness

Content providers need a way to measure and analyze
usage statistics of their content which may be distributed
on the Web. Performance indicators for Web sites, such as
page impressions, unique clients, visits and use time, need
to be extended to be able to take usage of off-site content -
i.e. content not presented on the original site - into account.
We see three options for addressing this issue described as
problem 3 in Section 3:

(1) One solution would be to force third party applications
to attribute the source of content with detailed provenance metadata which can be used to find all third party
applications using a certain resource and to create a
provenance index. Third party applications must expose
their usage statistics in a machine-interpretable way to
allow content provider to take them into account when
analyzing the usage statistics of their content.

This approach however has several limitations: First the
content provider or third party tracking services must
crawl the Web to find distributed content and build a
provenance index. Second the measurement and exposure of usage statistics must be standardized in order to allow different applications combine their usage
statistics. Third content providers need ways to esti-


terlink their content and not lock them and second it is not
possible to completely control the dissemination of digital
assets. Companies such as Apple had to learn this lesson
and stopped implementing DRM methods [2]. The newly
unlocked tracks now include the purchasers name and other
personally identifying information so that if users violate the
usage policies they can be held accountable for that.

6. CONCLUSION

In this paper we have described the dilemma of professional content providers who on the one hand want to reach
as many users as possible with their content but on the other
hand must lock their content on their sites for various reasons such as advertisement revenue, copyright issues and the
way usage statistics are generated.

To overcome these problems we have described how Semantic Web technologies can be used to semantically describe content bits and related usage restrictions in a machineinterpretable way. Finally we have proposed solutions for
tracing content dissemination on the Web and generating
cross-platform usage statistics.
