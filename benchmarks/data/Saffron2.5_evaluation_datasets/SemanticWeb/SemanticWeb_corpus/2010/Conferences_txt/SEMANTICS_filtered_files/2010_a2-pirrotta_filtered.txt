ABSTRACT
In this paper we describe our experience with building the
loius dataset, an interlinked RDF-based version of the Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research1 data,
containing statistics about University student activities. The
Linking Italian University Statistics Project (from now on
LOIUS) aims to set up a semantic platform serving both
humans and machines to efficiently explore the MIUR statistics and, at the same time, to be a contribute to the Linked
Data2 community.

1. MOTIVATION
The Government data play a strategic role in terms of government efficiency evaluation and should be clearly and
fully showed to all citizens. These data represent a huge
source of information evaluable as a measure of the Executive efficiency; also, everybody should be made aware of the
goodness of the government results.
The Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research
(MIUR) is the ministry of the Italian government responsible
for defining and coordinating general policy for University
education.

Each year it provides a complete analysis of data about University activity tendencies; these data are freely downloadable from MIUR Statistical Office website3.
Although Italian universities have full institutional auto-
nomy, they are supervised by MIUR.
The collected data represent a very valuable important source
of information to carry out singular analysis, to draw up interesting reports or to detect important evaluations devoted
to improve the University system itself.

The LOIUS project represents an attempt towards the adoption of semantic standards in publishing statistical data coming from MIUR Government.
The scope of the LOIUS project is to create a semantic platform for developing and building applications and services
easily, reusing MIUR data in different contexts, creating and
discovering new knowledge.

The LOIUS Platform represents a starting point to MIUR
statistical LD-consumption applications, a tool which enables us to explore and discover new knowledge among the
data, to pivot on dimensions and mashup with other data-
sets.
Rather than writing a Web application that serves only hu-
mans, as the fine CINECA web interface4 does, we decided
to publish the MIUR statistics on the Web in semantic format exposing the original data directly via Linked Data5
and opening up the way for all interested to query data in a
more flexible way and to develop applications on top of it.
Also, the LOIUS sub-project called SWIUP (Semantic Web
Italian University Project) aims to put on the Web all Italian University resources and,
linked with external data-
sets, it would like to be a contribute to the Linked Data
community2.

The paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we recall
the first statistical works developed until now using semantic
technologies whereas, in Section 3, some observations about
the current MIUR statistical Web interface and some obstacles we want to overcome are discussed. In Sections 4 and
5, we introduce the definition of LOIUS Ontology and its
software architecture, respectively. Finally, in section 6, we
present some LOIUS-consumption demo applications and, in
Section 7, we conclude on open issues and future platform
improvements.

In recent years an increasing number of statistical datasets
have been published using semantic technologies. One of the
first was the U.S. Census data Project6 where 1 billion RDF
triples containing statistical information about the United
States were published in 2007.
In 2008 the RIESE [1] project started to publish in RDFa
[2] the Eurostat data, providing European Union statistics
for humans and machines.

In 2009, the data.gov Project7 began to publish USA Government data adopting open standards, thus ensuring full
and complete usability, promoting government activity transparency and helping all citizens to guarantee accountability.
In the same year, the Data-gov Wiki project8 began to apply semantic technologies to data.gov datasets, translating
data into RDF, enriching values of data with their machineunderstandable meaning, linking the data with external datasets and developing interesting mashup applications.

Similarly to the previous projects, in 2010 another very important work, known as data.gov.uk project9, began to expose UK government data, adopting open standards, applying semantic technologies and ensuring a very high flexibility of querying in order to increase citizen awareness of
government functions.

3. MIUR DATA OBSERVATIONS
The CINECA Web Interface
Today it is possible to explore MIUR student statistics through
an excellent Web interface implemented by the non-profit
CINECA Consortium10.
Commissioned by MIUR, the CINECA has realized a datawarehouse project to analyze, in a simple and quick way,
University student data, evaluating effectiveness of training
processes through continuous monitoring.
The data are very up to date and are exposed through a Web
interface representing an effective tool to search, explore and
investigate all the Italian University student activities.
The tool allows us to carry out customized searches, obtaining high flexibility and easy reviews.
Moreover, the interface permits us to analyze in depth all
dimensions of the domain giving the possibility to map the
results in chart reports and geographical interactive views
(See Figure 1).
Further, the output results can be exported as xls/csv files
to be visualized offline.

Issues
Despite the great CINECA Web site, the MIUR statistics
still remain closed.
The data cannot be processed and exported automatically
in contexts different from the original one. This represents
a big problem. In fact, different views from those coming

from search result output are not viewable.
The Web tool does not provide a centralized system to automatically extract and join results to data coming from
different data sources; thus, there is no a simple way to increase the original statistical data value.
Also, it is not possible to build external applications automatically using the statistical data in order to create University Web services and increase the data flexibility.
To overcome these limits the LOIUS project aims to assign
information and metadata to the MIUR statistics in order
to specify a semantic context in a suitable format to the
interrogation, to the interpretation and, more generally, to
the automatic processing.
The LOIUS project assigns meaning to the statistical data
coming from the Italian University World using semantic technologies, interconnecting the data with other datasets and publishing the results following the Linked Data
principles5.
The LOIUS project is not meant to replace the CINECA
Web interface but rather to indicate improvements that can
be made.

4. THE LOIUS PROJECT

The Reference Data
Since 1999 the MIUR collects all data regulating University
activities in order to allow the monitoring and the evaluation of the whole Italian University System, including state
and non-state universities, technical universities, telematic
universities and universities for foreigners.
Each year the MIUR statistical office publishes the complete data in Microsoft Access format mainly divided into
two large categories: enrolled students (Bachelor and Master
degree students)11 and outgoing students (who have concluded their studies)12. The statistics are distributed on
several models (Table 1) representing the complex student
activities of each single University, faculty, degree course

11http://statistica.miur.it/scripts/IU/vIU0 bis.asp
12http://statistica.miur.it/scripts/IU/vIU0.asp


nance, birth year, genre, diploma year of students and so
forth. The reference data models contain aggregated information of the University world and not microdata about
individual students; they are stored in 14 Microsoft Access
files (almost 0.5 GB) for a total of 149 tables and more than
2.2 millions of rows.
Unfortunately, the models are not uniformly distributed over
the years and each year, the same model number can include
new dimensions and more details. This is the reason why
an initial and deep analysis was necessary in order to create
the LOIUS ontology.
The reference data involve the following items:

 21 Models
 Enrolled students (from 2001/2002 to 2007/08 aca-

demic year)

 Outgoing students (from 2001 to 2007 calendar year)
 103 Universities distributed over 20 Regions
 821 Faculties
 11,388 Degree courses
 Enrolled and outgoing students coming from 103 dif-

ferent Italian provinces and foreign countries

Data Reconciliation
First of all we carried out the data reconnaissance, namely
a deep schema analysis aimed at fully understanding the
MIUR statistical domain. To correct the original schemas
to model more accurately the domain, an intensive normalization task was performed. At this stage we fixed the misspelling and located the missing data and the inconsisten-
cies.
Once that was done we compared all schemas to identify
correlations and conflicts between the concepts expressed in
them, in order to clean and uniform data. After we identified all the homonyms and, reformatting the attributes, we
corrected all the synonymies present in different tables.

The LOIUS Ontology
The main aim of the LOIUS Ontology is capturing and modelling the set of concepts within the MIUR statistical data
domain and the relationships between those concepts. We
decided to describe our ontology extending the Statistical
Core Vocabulary (SCOVO) [3] which represents statistical
data on the Web.
In the SCOVO Ontology each Dataset
instance represents a container of some statistical domain
data and the Item instance represents a cell in a table. As
can be seen in Figure 2, each Item resource is defined by
a dataset, by a value and by one or more associated dimen-
sions.
After a careful and intense study of the statistical domain,
the dimension types, showed in Table 2, were identified.
By applying the LOIUS ontology the expressiveness in querying data increases enormously because each model, which
data are spread over 6-7 tables and can reach more than
300,000 rows, can be seen as a single graph and explored
using standard semantic technologies.

Mapping Analysis
Our target is to represent the statistics in a human/machine
understandable format so, to avoid a too large RDFa [2]
representation over the HTTP protocol and considering the
vastness of data, we choose to compose the datasets dividing
hierarchically the entire repository.
Depending on the model to represent and ever bearing in
mind to work with aggregate data, we define each Dataset
aggregating statistics for Faculty or for Degree course.
This strategy allows us to not overload the Web pages and to
identify and represent uniquely each dataset and cell, ado-

Table 2: LOIUS Dimension types

pting essentially two hierarchical URI patterns.
To guarantee an accessible and suitable RDFa representation to models involving provenance dimensions, we decided
to publish each Dataset on the Web in according to the following URI pattern (course detail level):

LOIUS_DS_HOME/:type_data/:model/:year/:university/:faculty/:course

On the contrary, to represent models not involving provenance dimensions, we composed each Dataset applying the
following URI pattern (faculty detail level):

LOIUS_DS_HOME/:type_data/:model/:year/:university/:faculty

where

LOIUS_DS_HOME = http://sw.unime.it/loius/dataset

In the statistical context the data to focus our attention on
is the single cell value and the relative dimension associated,
precisely why each cell becomes an instance of SCOVO Item
resource. Then we apply to each single cell, both the correct
typed value, using the RDF value property, and all LOIUS
dimensions identifying the cell in the dataset, that is why
we appreciate the SCOVO ontology cell-centric vision. The
item mapping flow is graphically represented in Figure 3.
Generally, to each statistical item we have to apply three
types of dimensions:

 Dataset (or Table) dimension - to be applied to

each item

 Row dimension - to be applied to each item belon-

ging to the same row dataset

 Column dimension - to be applied to each item be-

longing to the same column dataset

Since each Access table refers to a specific year (outgoing
student tables) or a specific academic year (enrolled student
tables), all items belonging to all datasets coming from those
Access tables will have the same year (or academic year) di-
mension, so it can be elected as Dataset dimension.
So, to each item referring to an enrolled student we will apply an instance of AcademicYear dimension, otherwise for
those relative to an outgoing student we will apply an instance of Year dimension.
Afterwards each item belongs to a particular dataset row,
which is identified by one or more key dimensions. In the
same way as before, also these key dimensions must be applied to each item belonging to the same row. Therefore, we
elect the University, Faculty, Course (and for some models
Provenance) dimension type as Row Dimension.

Figure 3: Item Mapping Flow

Finally, each item belonging to a specific column will inherit
all dimensions referring to that specific field.

We can see in Figure 4 the mapping graph of an item corresponding to the number of new male students in the 2001/02
academic year, at the University of Verona, Faculty of Motor Science, degree course in Sports and Motor Activities
Science coming from Belluno city, with a secondary school
diploma obtained in the 2000/01 School Year (coming from
model 12).

The relative URI DATASET will be:

http://sw.unime.it/loius/dataset/iscritti/modello12/
2001_2002/02301/143/9615

whereas the URI ITEM will be:

http://sw.unime.it/loius/dataset/iscritti/modello12/
2001_2002/02301/143/9615/025-dipl_2000_2001-gend_m

Using this strategy we describe a large number of RDF datasets (more than 180,000) and generate a total of almost
600 million triples applying the following ontologies:

 RDF(s)13 - Resource Description Framework (Schema)
 OWL14 - Web Ontology Language
 SCOVO15 - Statistical Core Vocabulary
 DC16 - Dublin Core Metadata Initiative
 Geonames Ontology17
 SWIUP18 - Semantic Web Italian University Project

To retrieve each single dataset we can navigate through Uni-
versity, faculty and so forth starting from the LOIUS website19 or we can find the right dataset by the SPARQL end-
point20.

5. THE LOIUS ARCHITECTURE

Introduction
Figure 5, representing the LOIUS Architecture, shows the
path carried out by statistical data from the MIUR Statistical Office website to the final users.
The goal of the infrastructure is to build a software platform in order to increase the original statistical data value,
thanks to the power of semantic technologies.
The platform ensures full interoperability with the outside
and the combined use of semantic tools guarantees a deep
data exploration of the Italian University student world, in
terms of flexibility and easy access.

To convert and publish all statistical data applying the LOIUS
ontology, a custom RDFizer Python tool has been develo-
ped. The main task of the tool mapping is to recognize a
valid LOIUS URI and provides, as output, the data converted in a human or machine-understandable format.
Next we will discuss the most important components of the
architecture.

The Mapping Task
First of all, considering the huge amount of data to be man-
aged, we decided to load all original statistical data into a
Mysql21 database management system instance.
To normalize and uniform dirty data, as we previously de-
scribed, we performed the optimization tasks running many
SQL scripts directly on the db instance.
To convert and publish the statistical data in semantic for-
mat, we developed a new schema instance to relate, for the
mapping process, all meta-information about table and column names with dimensions and reference years.
This schema represents the keystone on which the whole
process of mapping runs and on which we have developed,
according to the SCOVO approach, the cell-oriented python
RDFizer, rather than use a row-oriented mapper such as

21http://www.mysql.com/

D2R22 or Triplify23 .
Its job is extremely easy. It picks up a URI request from
outside and, if the request is valid, it pulls out the output
results in different formats (RDFa, RDF/XML, NT).
To publish data on the Web [4], in compliant to Linked Data
content negotiation mechanism [5], a cgi-python script has
been implemented.

The SPARQL Endpoint
The LOIUS mapping tool task is essentially used to generate
semantic output starting from statistical data and to show
the results to the final users.
However, if we wanted to perform a query on the data coming from several datasets, a generic SPARQL-client would
have to do several web connections to get the answer and
this would represent an unacceptable bound for the LOIUS
Platform because an arbitrary number of datasets can be
involved.
So, to overcome the problem, we decided to load all triples
into an instance of OpenLink Virtuoso triple store Server24
whose aim is, precisely, to provide a centralized SPARQL
endpoint for our semantic requests.
For loading the Virtuoso server with RDF data, we used
the mapping tool. So, we generated all NT triples from the
repository and loaded the dump files25 on the Virtuoso triple
store.
Now, the SPARQL endpoint26 exposes outside all statistical
data ensuring high flexibility and giving the possibility to
make arbitrary queries and pivoting data on more dimen-
sions.

Interlinking
One of the most important Linked Data rules, as the last
Linked Data principle states, is include links to other URIs,

22http://www4.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/bizer/d2r-server/
23http://triplify.org
24http://virtuoso.openlinksw.com/
25http://sw.unime.it/loius/download.html
26http://sw.unime.it:8890/sparql


so that they can discover more things 5.
In the LOIUS Architecture, the mapping tool generates,
server-side, the link between the student provenance dimension and the geonames geographical ontology27 through the
sameAs 28 OWL property.
Each student provenance dimension is outside interlinked as
follows:

<rdf:Description rdf:about="http://sw.unime.it/loius/dimension/provenance/025">

<rdf:type rdf:resource="http://sw.unime.it/loius/schema/Provenance"/>
<rdfs:label xml:lang="it">PROVENIENZA: BELLUNO</rdfs:label
<dc:title xml:lang="it">PROVENIENZA: BELLUNO</dc:title>
<owl:sameas rdf:resource="http://sws.geonames.org/6540117/"/>

</rdf:Description>

SWIUP - The LOIUS ontology is also linked to a very early
stage LOIUS sub-project called SWIUP (Semantic Web Italian University Project) whose target is to describe the resources and relationships regarding the Italian University
world (Universities, faculties, courses, didactic offers, lessons
and so forth).
Currently the SWIUP project publishes on the Web, as
Linked Data, all Italian universities, faculties and degree
courses as follows:

http://sw.unime.it/swiup/resource/:university
http://sw.unime.it/swiup/resource/:university/:faculty
http://sw.unime.it/swiup/resource/:university/:faculty/:course

Although the SWIUP ontology is not yet completed, we
adopted it to link each University, faculty and course dimension (LOIUS) with the relative University, faculty and
course resource (SWIUP) adding sameas owl property as
follows:

27http://www.geonames.org/
28http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#

<loius:University rdf:about="http://sw.unime.it/loius/dimension/university/02301">

<rdfs:label xml:lang="it">Universita degli studi di Verona</rdfs:label>
<owl:sameas rdf:resource="http://sw.unime.it/swiup/resource/univr"/>

</loius:University>

Starting from the LOIUS ontology dimension instance, we
can navigate through SWIUP resources to reach the relative
geonames and dbpedia datasets as follows:

<swp:University rdf:about="http://sw.unime.it/swiup/resource/univr">

<swp:hasLocation rdf:resource="http://sws.geonames.org/6541865/"/>
<owl:sameas rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/University_of_Verona"/>

</swp:University>

Figure 6: Zoom from the LOIUS Architecture Fig-
ure

On one hand the interlinking enriches the SWIUP resource
data providing a set of useful information coming from dbpedia and geonames datasets, on the other the Linked Data
community could benefit by the high level of detail the SWIUP
ontology can describe about the Italian University manage-

ment system in terms of organization and teaching. In Figure 6 it is graphically displayed how the LOIUS ontology is
connected to the Linked Data cloud.

 from SPARQL Endpoint, we can carry out complex requests on the whole LOIUS ontology joining high flexibility of exploration with easy access.

6. USING LOIUS
Once the infrastructure has been built, we are ready to develop semantic applications using the LOIUS Platform services for:

 humans, an XHTML version of LOIUS data is available at http://sw.unime.it/loius, so that we can hierarchically explore the MIUR statistics starting from
choosing the analysis type until reaching the final dataset
exposed in RDFa [6], as can be seen in Figure 7.

 machines,

 from single page, a SPARQL-client can retrieve
the data from single dataset querying directly the
single page that will reply with relative RDF results as can be seen in Figure 8.

Now we present some LOIUS scenarios.

Scenario 1 - Suppose the MIUR wants to draw up the
top ten ranking list of the courses with the highest number of new female students in the 2007/08 academic year
to estimate the female attractiveness index of Italian degree courses. Of course the CINECA website performs very
flexible queries in the student data but, to the best of our
knowledge, a quick and direct search to solve our purpose is
not present. Using the LOIUS ontology the following query
meets our needs:

SELECT ?course ?val

WHERE {

?items a scv:Item;
rdf:value ?val;
scv:dataset [scv:dimension <http://sw.unime.it/loius/dimension/model/24>];
scv:dimension <http://sw.unime.it/loius/dimension/academicyear/2007_2008>;
scv:dimension [a loius:Course; dc:title ?course];
scv:dimension <http://sw.unime.it/loius/dimension/birthyear/all_years_total>;
scv:dimension <http://sw.unime.it/loius/dimension/gender/f>.

ORDER BY DESC(?val) LIMIT 10


Scenario 2 - Suppose we want to analyze the graduation
trend over the years of the Faculty of Sciences in the University of Messina.
Also we want to export the result outside in order to develop
external application and publish the web data in charts using
third-API services.
To request the data we need, we can use our preferred programming language and the relative SPARQL-client library
to send the following query:

SELECT ?year ?course SUM(?val) as ?outgoing
WHERE {

?items a scv:Item;

?val;

rdf:value
scv:dimension <http://sw.unime.it/loius/dimension/university/08301>;
scv:dimension <http://sw.unime.it/loius/dimension/faculty/563>;
scv:dimension <http://sw.unime.it/loius/dimension/degreescore/all_scores_total>;
scv:dimension [a loius:Year; dc:title ?year];
scv:dimension [a loius:Course; dc:title ?course];
scv:dataset

[scv:dimension <http://sw.unime.it/loius/dimension/model/22>].

} order by ?year DESC(?outgoing)

The result data are then showed using the Google motion
chart service29 as you can see in Figure 9.

Scenario 3 - Suppose we want to compare the Italian
University system with Scottish University statistics coming
from the HESA (Higher Education Statistics Agency30) table 0b31 describing all Scottish students by institution and
level of study in the academic year 2004/05. Unfortunately
Scottish University statistics are not available in RDF format so we cannot immediately mashup the two University
systems. Concepts as institutions, faculties, academic years
and so forth, are very common in the University domain so
we decide to apply the LOIUS ontology (but we can apply
a different RDF ontology) to describe a part of Scottish statistics showing the high flexibiliy the semantic technologies
can reach. RDFizing the Scottish statistics32 we can mashup

the two University systems as follows:

SELECT ?university ?lat ?long SUM(?val) as ?num

FROM NAMED <http://sw.unime.it/uniscotland>

?items a scv:Item;

scv:dimension ?unidim.
?unidim a loius:University;
owl:sameas ?unire.

?unire dc:title ?university;

geo:lat ?lat;
geo:long ?long.

Finally we used a geographical map33, with sized and colored
circle markers, to denote the total values. The data, queried
by a custom Yahoo Pipes application34, are displayed using
the Google chart tools above mentioned as you can see in
Figure 10.

7. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper we have presented the LOIUS Project, a semantic platform translating the MIUR student statistics in
RDF to serve both humans and machines.
After explaining the reasons that motivated us to start the
work, the paper describes the data reference used in the
project, and the mapping analysis used to define the LOIUS

33http://sw.unime.it/loiusapp/scotland.php
34http://pipes.yahoo.com


ontology.
Then, the software architecture has been described focusing
on the discussion of each component and on the interlinking
among external datasets. Finally, some demo examples of
LOIUS-consumption applications are presented showing interactive chart/map reports.
To realize the project many technologies have been adopted
such as ontologies, Python language, Mysql database, Apache
Web Server, Virtuoso triple store.
Our target was to publish and use the statistical MIUR tables using semantic tools, so providing an effective and easy
access.

Nevertheless, many things can still be improved.

First of all, the MIUR Statistical Office updates the archive
almost monthly, so constantly we have to account for any
changes, adding new data in the Mysql repository, map it
and generate the triples to be inserted into the Virtuoso
store. The whole procedure is not very fast, so, for this
reason, in the near future we hope to collaborate directly
with the MIUR Statistical Office to improve the Platform.
For example, a real improvement would consist in accessing
directly the MIUR Statistical Office database, in order to
have ever fresh and updated data, so avoiding the archive
downloads.
In this case the RDFizer tool should be partially modified to respond to the new architecture of the
data store.

Another issue we note is that statistics are stored both in the
Mysql repository for XHTML+RDFa views and in the Virtuoso triple store server (SPARQL Endpoint) forcing us to
duplicate the data in both systems. Further, the alignment
of the two systems represents a bottleneck for the LOIUS
Platform itself. To overcome this problem and improve the
system, in future we plan to use the Virtuoso server as the
unique LOIUS Platform store.

Also, a real improvement in the LOIUS project could be the
adoption of the Statistical Data and Metadata Exchange

(SDMX) standard information model35 in order to increase
the efficiency of the system. Thanks to work in [7] it is now
possible to bring together SDMX and SCOVO and take advantage of the SDMX features such as the standard definition of the dimensions and attributes.

Currently the MIUR statistics can be used and published
citing the MIUR source (as the MIUR statistical office disclaimer states36) but no mention is made about the license
regulating the data so, next, we hope (once authorized) to
release the rdfized statistics with the well-known Creative

We are confident that the LOIUS project may offer to the
community a new way of looking at MIUR statistics, exploiting the potential of the semantic web. In fact, the work
wants to represent a proposal to the MIUR to consider the
semantic solution LOIUS offers, as possible improvements in
publishing statistical data. Also, inspired by the same ideals
and thanks to the evolution of the SWIUP ontology, it aims
to be a contribution to the Linked Data community.

Finally, I would like to thank Prof. Francesco Oliveri for all
his support and motivation during the development of this
project.
