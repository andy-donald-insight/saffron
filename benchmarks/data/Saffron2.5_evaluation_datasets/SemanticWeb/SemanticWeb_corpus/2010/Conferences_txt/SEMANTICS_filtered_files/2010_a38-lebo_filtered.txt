ABSTRACT
Linked Data provide many benefits to data consumers, but
many publicly available datasets are still released in the
Comma Separated Values (CSV) format, a ubiquitous common denominator. We introduce a methodology to transform such datasets into Linked Data. Our design is based on
requirements identified while surveying existing governmental datasets released by data.gov. We present an implementationindependent RDF vocabulary to describe how a CSV dataset
should be promoted into Linked Data, and use a Java-based
converter to produce 5.3 billion RDF triples from 312 data.gov
datasets.

INTRODUCTION

Although RDF and Linked Data provide many benefits,
other factors influence an organizations choice of data rep-
resentation. When organizations publish their data in alternate forms, its consumers must choose to adopt potentially
ad hoc conventions or disregard the datas potential. The
Comma Separated Values (CSV) format remains a ubiquitous common denominator for the transfer of tabular data,
likely because of its simple text-based structure and ease of
processing with a wide variety of tools. Unfortunately, the
simple structure of the CSV format makes interpretation of
the data difficult without domain knowledge, accompanying
codebook data, and manual data inspection.

We present an approach which supports motivated parties to produce quality Linked Data from third-party CSV
sources. Because deciphering others data can be time con-
suming, we strive to minimize the initial time commitment
required to produce RDF. Using only three parameters that
describe the dataset, RDF can be automatically produced
in a structure amenable to further enhancement and linking.
As time, motivation, and domain understanding permit, incremental enhancements can improve the data quality, structural modeling, or data linking.

2. DATA CONVERSION

Our approach provides stable RDF data that can be improved without disrupting existing applications that use it.
Importantly, each incremental enhancement produces a new
dataset combining existing RDF with newly enhanced data.
Data from previous enhancements are never changed, only
added to. In this way, applications may rely on the types
and structure of data available at the time they were written
without concern that said data will be changed by further
enhancements. A full description of the URI scheme that
enables this stability is beyond the scope of this paper1

In converting CSV data to Linked Data, we distinguish
between two types of conversion processes: raw conversions
and enhancement conversions. Raw conversions are used to
convert CSV data to simple RDF while enhancement conversions are used to iteratively increase the quality of the
RDF by casting values to datatypes and resources, restructuring relationships, and linking to external ontologies and
datasets.

Both types of conversion process are driven by declarative
parameters encoded using RDF. This RDF not only prescribes how conversion tools should process the input data,
but also provides a provenance history of the operations that
led from the original CSV source to published Linked Data.
The conversion ontology used for encoding the declarative
parameters is identified by the URI
http://purl.org/twc/vocab/conversion/ and is abbreviated by the prefix conv: in the following discussion. Due to
space limitations in this paper, URIs segments of the form
/source/data-gov/dataset/NNN/version/ are abbreviated
using the form /s/data-gov/d/NNN/v/.
2.1 Raw Conversion

Raw conversion is designed to make CSV data quickly
accessible to existing RDF tools. Although the conversion

expect and desire are left for subsequent enhancement conversions (see Section 2.2). To illustrate this, two sample
rows based on data.gov dataset 1450 are shown in Table 1,
while the triples resulting from both raw and enhancement
conversions are shown in Figure 1. To convert a CSV table into an RDF graph, a URI is minted for each row and
described with predicates derived from each column. The
columns cell value becomes the triples plain literal object.
Raw conversion may be parameterized to handle structural
variances such as header rows that appear after the first row
(due to titles and captions) and data rows that finish before
the last.
2.2 Enhancement Conversions

Enhancement conversion takes an existing RDF dataset as
input and produces new RDF triples by applying enhancement operations to the input data. The parameter ontology
uses the terms domain, range, subproperty, and subclass in
ways that reflect the RDFS semantics. Below we describe
the primary enhancement operations, the parameters that
invoke them, and their resulting RDF. A full example of
enhancement parameters is shown in Figure 1.

2.2.1 Row Typing
Because URIs created for CSV rows are central to the
resulting RDF, it should be easy to understand and select
them as members of a domain-relevant class. For exam-
ple, rows in Dataset 1491 represent Disasters, while rows in
Dataset 1492 represent Disaster Aid Obligations. These can
be typed using conv:domain_name on any property enhance-
ment.

2.2.2 Casting to Datatypes and Resources
Casting turns plain literals into URIs or typed literals in-

cluding XSD numerics, xsd:boolean, xsd:date and xsd:dateTime.
Parameters can be added to handle untraditional interpreta-
tions. For example, as shown in Table 1, a * represents true
and an empty value represents false. Pairs of conv:symbol
and conv:interpretation can be used as shown in Figure 1. Similarly, date patterns such as M/d/yy may be
provided to allow parsing a wide range of xsd:dates and
xsd:dateTimes.

2.2.3 Resource Promotions
Values may be promoted to resources in several more complex ways than simple casting. When this promotion oc-
curs, the raw literal being promoted becomes an rdfs:label
of the promoted resource. Property-scoped promotion converts all the values originating from a specific CSV column
into resources in a dataset- and column-specific value space.
For example, Dataset 1564 cites a Marketing Category
for animal-tested drugs with values NADA, ANADA,
and UNAPPROVED OTHER and would be promoted to
/s/data-gov/d/1564/value-of/marketing_category/NADA
Typed promotion is similar to property-scoped promotion
with the exception that the resource value space is specified
by a type. If two columns contain state abbreviations, both
columns would be promoted with the type state and result in identical URIs. For example, the columns in Dataset
1147 indicating Alabamas FIPS code of 01 as an origin
or destination state of migration flow are promoted to the
form /s/data-gov/d/1147/typed/state/01.

Column bundling introduces a new resource that takes
over ownership of a number of existing property-value pairs
for each row instance. For example, the columns in Dataset
1171 containing the prefix, first name, middle name, last
name, and suffix of members of Federal Advisory Committee
Act committees are associated with a URI representing the
person instead of the row of the CSV.

Finally, crutch promotion allows a promoted values URI
to be constructed based on several property values. URI
construction is based on a template parameter that specifies
the relevant property values. For example, the District
column in Dataset 1330, which references congressional districts by number, can be crutch-promoted using the value of
the state column using the pattern [@state]-[@district],
resulting in a URI of
/s/data-gov/d/1330/value-of/district/CA-1. In this sense,
District uses State as a crutch to be promoted to a resource that stands on its own.

Subclass and Subproperty Linking

Linking to external ontologies may be performed at the
class or property level. In each case, the local name of the
class or property is cited along with the external property
or class. Each subproperty or subclass enhancement results
in an additional triple for each involved resource. For ex-
ample, Figure 1 describes the legal entity name property
as a subproperty of foaf:name, resulting in two foaf:name
triples.

2.2.5 Object sameAs Linking
Promoted resources can be linked to external resources
with owl:sameAs. Literal values used to create the resources
are matched with values in a linking file containing descriptions of external resources. For example, in Dataset 1492,
the state value Texas is matched with a triple in the linking file dbpedia:Texas dc:identifier "Texas", yielding
</s/data-gov/d/1492/v/2010-Jan-21/typed/state/Texas>
owl:sameAs dbpedia:Texas. Multiple linking files may be
specified at the same time to expand the scope of external
linking, and resources may have any number of identifiers.
Linking files can be reused and augmented for subsequent
dataset linking.
2.3 Application to Data.gov Datasets

Data.govs simple and consistent URL structure allows for
straightforward automation to retrieve available data files.
We retrieved all CSV datasets available from data.gov and
converted them to RDF using the approach described above.
Of the 1780 datasets listed in the Data.gov Raw Data Cat-
alog, 312 datasets are available as CSV (some datasets providing more than one CSV file). In all, we retrieved 992 CSV
files and converted them into 5.3B triples using the raw conversion parameters. The process of converting all 992 CSV
files to RDF took under 12 hours on a Dell PowerEdge T610
with dual Xeon E5504 quad-core 2.0GHz CPUs.

Because enhancements require a degree of domain under-
standing, the raw conversions have been supplemented with
only 24 million triples to date. These 24 million triples
were the result of one of the authors spending 2 days investigating datasets and producing enhancement parame-
ters; we believe enhancing other datasets would yield similar results, even with a minimally-trained user identifying the enhancement parameters. So far, the rows in 4

datasets are typed to domain-specific classes. 1,546 properties are datatype properties with the following ranges:
xsd:gYear (6), xsd:boolean (7), xsd:date (12), xsd:dateTime
(12), xsd:nonNegativeInteger (78), xsd:integer (306), and
xsd:decimal (1,125). Seven properties are bundled. Of 120
properties promoted to resources, 30 are typed, 4 use crutches,
and 12 are linked with owl:sameAs. Of the 30 typed pro-
motions, 4 subclass FOAF or W3Cs WGS84 classes. Fi-
nally, the 12 linked properties lead to 950 resources asserted
as owl:sameAs to resources in DBpedia, GovTrack.us, and

3. CONCLUSIONS

We have presented an approach to convert third party
CSV data into Linked Data in a way that allows incremental
enhancements to stably augment its initial conversion. Applying this approach, we have converted a large amount of
US governmental data into RDF and have begun the process
of enhancing it with data typing, restructured relationships,
and linking into the Linked Open Data cloud. Based on this

experience we believe the enhancement of data.gov data can
progress quickly and with minimal effort by a broader com-
munity. We hope that this methodology can be used to
bootstrap similar Linked Data publishing efforts involving
existing CSV data sources, and help inspire data providers
to adopt semantic web techniques in their future data publication strategies.

We see two primary challenges to applying the capabilities
we present more broadly. First, an appropriate user interface is required to increase the accessibility of these capa-
bilities. Second, a creative solution to enable and motivate
distributed, ad hoc communities to join forces to promote
and link CSV datasets would provide impetus for continual
contributions. The approach we present here would underlie
this ecosystem and may require additional development to
support these additional requirements.
