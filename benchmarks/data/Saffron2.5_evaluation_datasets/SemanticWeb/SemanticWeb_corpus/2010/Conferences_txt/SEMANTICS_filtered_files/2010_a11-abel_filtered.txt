ABSTRACT
Today, users leave a plethora of traces on the Web. They fill
traditional profile information at social networking services,
write articles in their personal blogs or annotate social media
content in resource sharing systems such as Flickr or Deli-
cious. In this paper we present the so-called Mypes service
that connects, aggregates, aligns and enriches profile information form diverse online services and makes the bundled
profiles available for end-users and third-party applications.
It enables end-users to overview their distributed profile data
traces and provides application developers means for integrating aggregated profile data into their applications to feature personalization. Our evaluation reveals the benefits of
Mypes: it generates semantically rich user profiles with high
precision.

INTRODUCTION

While browsing the Web, providing profile information in
social networking services, or tagging pictures, users leave
a plethora of traces. Social networking services (e.g. Facebook or LinkedIn) make profile information such as contact
details or friend connections of a user available, social media systems (e.g. Delicious or Flickr) store bookmarks, pictures and other media together with textual annotations and
many Web systems log the clicks of a user. Hence, diverse
user data is distributed across the Web [2].

The distributed user data constitutes a valuable source of
information for systems that would like to provide personalized services to their end-users as these systems require
information about their users in order to adapt their functionality [9].
In particular, systems that are not able to
collect sufficient data about their users, e.g., because they
are infrequently used or do not have a large user base, could
profit from aggregating and exploiting the distributed user
profile traces.

Casual users are often not aware what kind of information
about themselves is available on the Web. For example, recently PleaseRobMe 1 attracted publics attention as they exploited foursquare 2 to detect the current location of Twitter
users and identifygiven the address of these users houses
and apartments that are easy to burgle as the inhabitants
are currently traveling. Hence, end-user would benefit from
a service that enables them to overlook their distributed
data traces.

In this paper we present Mypes3, a service that connects
profile information from social networking services (Face-
book, LinkedIn), social media services (Flickr, Delicious,
StumbleUpon, Twitter, Blogspot) and others (Google). Mypes aligns the heterogeneous profiles and moreover enriches
tag-based profiles with additional semantics obtained from
WordNet [10]. It enables users to overview their distributed
profiles and allows application developers to integrate aggre-
gated, semantically enriched profile data in RDF or vCard

format via a lightweight REST interface into their applications to provide personalization.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 summarizes
the related work.
In Section 3 we present the Mypes approach as well as selected Mypes features. We evaluate
Mypes in Section 4 and finally conclude this paper with a
short summary and an outlook to planned future works.

2. RELATED WORK

Connecting data from different sources and services is in
line with todays Web 2.0 trend of creating mashups of various applications [14]. Support for the development of interoperable services is provided by initiatives such as the Linked
Data initiative [4] or the dataportability project4, standardization of APIs (e.g. OpenSocial5) and authentication and
authorization protocols (e.g. OpenID6, OAuth7), as well as
by (Semantic) Web standards such as RDF, RSS and specific
Microformats. Further, it becomes easier to connect distributed user profilesincluding social connectionsdue to
the increasing take-up of standards like FOAF [6], SIOC[5],
or GUMO [8]. Solutions for user identification form the basis for personalization across application boundaries [7] and
Googles Social Graph API8 enables application developers
to obtain the social connections of an individual user across
different services. Generic user modeling servers such as
CUMULATE [13] or PersonIs [3] as well as frameworks for
mashing up profile information [1] appear that facilitate han-

dling of aggregated user data. Given these developments, it
becomes more and more important to develop approaches
that exploit the linked profile information in context of todays Web scenery.

In [12], Szomszor et al. present an approach to combine
profiles generated in two different tagging platforms to obtain richer interest profiles; Stewart et al. demonstrate the
benefits of combining blogging data and tag assignments
from Last.fm to improve the quality of music recommendations [11]. In this paper we present a solution that goes
beyond linkage of tag-based user profiles, which we moreover enrich with Wordnet facets, as we consider also explicitly provided profiles coming from different social networking and social media services.
In [2], we already revealed the benefits of interweaving public profile informa-
tion: more complete profiles, advanced FOAF/vCard profile generation, disclosure of new facets about users, higher
level of self-information induced by the profiles, and higher
precision for predicting tag-based profiles to solve the cold
start problem. In this paper we present the corresponding
service that enables people to apply the approaches for interweaving profile information and thus to benefit from these
advantages.

Mypes supports the task of gathering information about
users for user adaptive systems [9]. In this section we first
present the general approach before we present Mypes features in more detail.
3.1 Mypes Approach

and (iv) friend connections.

for casual users, who would like to overview their distributed
profile data, as well as systems that require additional information about their users. To feature access to the distributed profile data, Mypes and the corresponding components depicted in Figure 1 respectively perform the following
steps:

1. Account Mapping Given a users URI of an online ac-
count, the Mypes service gathers other online accounts
of the same user by exploiting the Google Social Graph
API, which provides such mappings for all users who
linked their accounts via their Google profile, for example (cf. foaf:holdsAccount in Figure 3(b)):

"http://www.google.com/profiles/fabian.abel":

"claimed_nodes": [

"http://delicious.com/fabianabel",
"http://fabianabel.stumbleupon.com",
"http://www.last.fm/user/fabianabel/",
...

For those users where no mappings can be obtained via
API, it is possible to provide appropriate mappings by
hand. The account mapping module finally provides a
list of online accounts that are associated to a particular user.

2. Social Web Aggregator For the URIs associated to
the user, the aggregator module gathers profile data
from the corresponding services. In particular, traditional profile information (e.g., name, homepage, loca-
tion, etc.), tag-based profiles (tagging activities), posts
(e..g, bookmark postings, blog posts, picture uploads),
and friend connections (Flickr contacts and Last.fm
friends) are harvested from nine different services as
depicted in Table 1.

3. Profile Alignment The profiles gathered from the different services are aligned with a uniform user model

by means of hand-crafted rules. Mypes provides functionality to export the aligned, aggregated profile data
into different formats such as FOAF and vCard.

4. Semantic Enrichment Tag-based profiles are further
enriched and clustered by means of WordNet categories which allows clients, for example, to access particular parts of a tag-based profile such as facets related to locations or people. Therefore, Mypes performs a WordNet dictonary lookup to obtain the toplevel categories that can be deduced from the correspond to the lexicographer file organization9. Hence,
only tags that are contained in the WordNet dictionary
will be mapped to WordNet categories. We discovered
that approx. 65% of the tags can be mapped to appropriate WordNet categories [2].

3.2 Mypes Features

In [2] we investigated the nature of the distributed profile traces. We observed that individual users complete their
profiles at different profiles to a different degree. For exam-
ple, users completed their Twitter profile up to just 48.9%
on average. As we believe that there exist users who intentionally do not complete their Twitter profiles and who are
not aware that their Twitter account can be connected with
other accounts that provide the missing profile information,
Mypes enables users to overview the completeness of their
public profiles as depicted in Figure 2. Users can moreover
inspect to which degree the Mypes profile, i.e. the aggregation of the different profiles, could complete their profiles
at the different services. In the example shown in Figure 2,
the completeness of the users actual Twitter profile is 50%.
However, all missing entries are available via the Mypes pro-
file.

Figure 3 shows an example of an aggregated Mypes pro-
file, namely the traditional profile attributes gathered from

filled and to which degree they could be filled if profile information from the different services is merged.

the diverse services (see Table 1). The traditional profile is
also accessible in FOAF and vCard format via HTTP.GET.
For example, the FOAF profile in RDF/XML syntax as
listed in Figure 3(b) is returned when the client accesses
http://mypes.groupme.org/mypes/user/116033/rdf. Mypes exports all available values for a profile attribute, e.g., if
a user specifies her name differently at the different services
then all these different values are provided.

Mypes also connects the tagging activities users perform
in the different tagging systems. Figure 4(a) shows the aggregated tag cloud. As Mypes enriches tag assignments with
meta-information that states to which WordNet category
the corresponding tag belongs to, it is possible to filter tag
clouds according to WordNet categories. For example, Figure 4(a) also shows the aggregated tag cloud filtered so that
only tags related to locations are displayed. For this kind of

tag cloud, Mypes provides an alternative visualization: tags
related to locations are mapped to country codes (using the
GeoNames Web service10), which are sent to Googles visualization API to draw a geographical intensity map that
highlights those countries that are frequently referenced by
tags (referring to the countrys name or to a city located
in the country) in the profile (see bottom in Figure 4(a)).
Mypes also features RDF export for these (specific facets of)
tag-based profiles using the Tag Ontology11 and SCOT12 vo-
cabulary. Figure 4(b) lists the RDF representation of the tag
cloud related to locations that is visualized in Figure 4(a):
for each tag the absolute usage frequency is specified.

In summary, the different types of profiles, i.e. tag-based
as well as traditional profiles, are thus available in RDF
which allows third-party applications to benefit from profile
aggregation, alignment and enrichment.

4. EVALUATION

In this section we evaluate the Mypes system. We therefore crawled the public profiles of 116032 distinct users via
Googles profile search13. Thereby we obtained (i) 338 users
who have specified a traditional profile at Facebook, LinkedIn,
10http://www.geonames.org/
11http://www.holygoat.co.uk/projects/tags/
12http://scot-project.org/scot/
13http://www.google.com/profiles?q=query

Twitter, Flickr, and Google profiles, (ii) 139 users who have
a tag-based profile their Flickr, StumbleUpon, Delicious, and
Last.fm account, and 53 users who have an account at all
services mentioned before (see Section 3.1). Given these
users and their profile data, our main research questions are
the following.

1. What are the benefits of the Mypes approach?

2. How accurate does the Mypes service work?

3. How fast does the Mypes service work?

In the subsequent sections we will answer the questions

above.
4.1 Benefits of Mypes Approach

The advantage of Mypes is that it makes the distributed
profile traces available to end-users and application develop-
ers. For example, application developers do not need to aggregate and align profile data from different services, but can
just access Mypes as described in Section 3.2. Such aggregation would be needless if there exists already a service which
makes profiles available that are more valuable than Mypes
profiles. Hence, we first show that the aggregated Mypes
profiles really embody more detailed information than the
service-specific profiles.

Figure 6: Entropy and self-information of servicespecific profiles in comparison to the aggregated
Mypes profiles.

Figure 5 depicts the completeness of the 338 traditional
profiles and shows that the completeness of the profiles varies
from service to service. The public profiles available in
the social networking sites Facebook and LinkedIn are filled
more accurately than the Twitter, Flickr, or Google profiles,
which might be explained by the intention of the different
services.

The aggregated Mypes profiles reveal more facets (17 distinct attributes) about the users than the public profiles
available in each separate service. On average, the completeness of the aggregated profile is 83.3%: more than 14
attributes are filled with meaningful values. As a compari-
son, this is 7.6 for Facebook, 8.2 for LinkedIn and 3.3 for
Flickr. Aggregated profiles therewith reveal significantly
more information about the users than the public profiles
of the single services.

Further, profile aggregation enables completion of the profiles available at the specific services. For example, by enriching the incomplete Twitter profiles with information gathered from the other services, the completeness increases to
more than 98% (see Figure 5): profile fields that are often left blank, such as location and homepage, can be obtained from the social networking sites. Moreover, even the
rather complete Facebook and LinkedIn profiles can benefit
from profile aggregation: LinkedIn profiles can, on average,
be improved by 7%, even though LinkedIn provides three
attributesinterests, education and industrythat are not
in the public profiles of the other services (cf. Table 1).

To investigate whether the tag-based Mypes profiles also
disclose more information then the tag-based profiles of the
individual services, we measure the entropy and self-infor-
mation of the profiles. Figure 6 comparesfor the 139 users
with accounts at services providing tag-based profiles (cf.
Table 1)the averaged entropy and self-information of the
tag-based profiles obtained from the different services with
the aggregated profile. The entropy of a tag-based profile
T, which contains of a set of tags t, is computed as follows.

To clarify the meaning of entropy and self-information in
context of the tag-based user profiles, we apply the metrics to example profiles that belong to a specific user (see
Table 2).

Table 2: Entropy and average self-information of example profiles. The tag-based profiles contain for
each tag the corresponding usage frequency which is
applied to model the probability p(t) that the tag t
appears in the user profile.

The self-information and entropy of the example profiles
listed in Table 2 depend on the number of tags that appear in the profiles and the corresponding usage frequencies
as well. Bobs tag-based profiles in Flickr (flickr-bob) and
StumbleUpon (stumble-bob) both contain two distinct tags.
However, the self-information of the StumbleUpon profile is
higher than the self-information of the Flickr profile as tags
appear with different probabilities (e.g., p(research) = 8/12
and p(semantic web) = 4/12 ) instead of being uniformly distributed (e.g., p(hannover) = 8/16 and p(italy) = 8/16 ). In
contrast, entropy is higher for those tag-based profiles having a rather uniform distribution and implying a higher level

In Equation 1, p(t) denotes the probability that the tag t
was utilized by the corresponding user. Self-information is

14Using base 2 for the computation of the logarithm allows
for measuring self-information as well as entropy in bits.

The aggregation of the three profiles listed
in Table 2 (mypes-bob) reveals the highest self-information
and entropy.

In Figure 6, we summarize self-information (= average
of the mean self-information of the users tag-based pro-
files) and entropy of the real-world profiles belonging to the
139 users we considered. Among the service-specific pro-
files, the tag-based profiles in Delicious, which also have the
largest size (on average 165.83 distinct tags), bear the highest entropy and average self-information. By aggregating
the tag-based profiles, self-information increases clearly by
19.5% and 17.7% with respect to the Flickr and StumbleUpon profiles respectively. Further, the tag-based profiles
in Delicious can benefit from the profile aggregation as the
self-information would increase by 2.7% (from 8.53 bit to
8.76 bit) which is also considerably higher, considering that
self-information is measured in bits (e.g., with 8.53 bits one
could describe 370 states while 8.76 bits allow for decoding of 434 states). The aggregated tag-based Mypes profiles
thus reveal more valuable new information about individual
users than focusing just on information from single services.
In summary, we can therewith answer the first research
question raised at the beginning of this section: a core benefit of Mypes is that it provides user profiles that reveal more
information than profiles available in specific services.
4.2 Accuracy of Mypes

The accuracy of Mypes depends on the the accuracy of

the single Mypes components (cf. Section 3.1):

1. The precision of the account mapping is influenced by
the users who link their different online accounts in
their Google profile. It is possible that users claim that
some online account belongs to them even if it does
belong to another user (see My Links at Google Profile
editing page15). However, for the 53 users we crawled
who linked the nine services mentioned in Table 1 this
did not happen.

2. We assume that the accuracy of the Social Web Aggregator is always 100% because it could only drop below
100% if a service provider would deliver profile information that does not belong to the account for which
Mypes is requesting information.

3. The profile alignment of traditional profiles also does
not affect the accuracy negatively as it is based on
hand-crafted rules that map service-specific attributes
to a uniform user model.

4. The semantic enrichment component is intended to
add further value to the aggregated profiles: tag-based
profiles are enriched with metadata that specifies to
which WordNet category a tag belongs to. Such metadata might be wrong. Hence, we analyze the accuracy
of the semantic enrichment in more detail.

We randomly selected 30 users, inspected all tag-based
Mypes profiles and marked whether the attached metadata
i.e. the WordNet category assigned to a tagis correct. On
average, the tag-based profiles contained 159.4 tags. Figure 7 lists the precision of the semantic enrichment: the

15http://www.google.com/profiles/me/editprofile?edit=s

Figure 7: Precision of semantic enrichment with
WordNet categories.

number of correct WordNet category assignments divided
by the overall number of WordNet category assignments.

The overall precision of the semantic enrichment is 73.1%.

However, the quality varies strongly with the particular WordNet category. For example, regarding tags related to artifacts (e.g., bike) or communication (e.g., hypertext, web)
the accuracy is best with 90.5% and 88.2% respectively. By
contrast, 33.1% precision for tags related to persons (e.g.,
me, george) is rather poor.

In summary, we discover that the accuracy of Mypes depends on the single components. Account mapping, profile
aggregation and profile alignment are based on hand-crafted
rules and thus do not influence the accuracy negatively. The
semantic enrichment which automatically attaches semantics to the tag-based profiles produces a high precision of
73.1%. In our future work we will also evaluate the recall
and plan to optimize precision and recall of the semantic
enrichment.

4.3 Runtime Analysis

Given the 30 users randomly selected users from the previous section, we measured runtime behavior of Mypes. Figure 8 summarizes the results of this preliminary evaluation.

Figure 8: Average time (in milliseconds on a logarithmic scale) required for obtaining tag-based and
traditional profiles and the corresponding standard
deviation.

645 milliseconds and is therewith much faster then gathering the tag-based profiles which took, on average, 32830
milliseconds. The huge difference can be explained by the
high number of tagging activities: Mypes considered, on av-
erage, 526.3 tagging activities (= tag assignments) to construct the tag-based profiles which required to call the service APIs multiple times to obtain the required data. Mypes
thus caches tag-based profiles (cf. Figure 1) which improves
the performance significantly as depicted in Figure 8.

In summary, Mypes aggregates traditional profiles very
fast (less than one second) while the aggregation of tag-based
profiles works slowly. Mypes therefore provides caching func-
tionality. In our future work we will further analyze how the
runtime performance can be improved.

5. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper we presented Mypes, a service that makes
distributed public profile traces available to users and application developers. Mypes (1) determines the different service accounts that belong to the same user, (2) aggregates
profile information from the different services, (3) aligns
these profiles and (4) enriches the profiles with additional
semantics. Mypes provides visualizations of the profile data
to the end-users enabling them to overview their distributed
profile traces. Further, it features RDF and vCard export
functionality to enable applications to integrate the profile
data.

Our evaluation showed that Mypes produce rich user profiles that reveal more information than profiles available
in specific services. Mypes profiles can even be used to
complete service-specific profiles, for example, Twitter profile completeness doubles when the missing profile fields are
completed with data from the Mypes profiles. Further, we
demonstrated that Mypes works with high precision: tagbased profiles are enriched with additional semantics from
WordNet with a precision of 73%.

In our future work we plan to extend the list of currently
nine supported social networking and social media services.
Moreover, we would like to make the semantics of the tagbased profiles more explicit by mapping the actual tags to
DBpedia16 URIs that clearly define the meaning of a tag.
Finally, we will integrate the Mypes service into an existing
user modeling framework [1] and evaluate the actual benefit for end-users of adaptive applications that make their
adaptation decisions based on Mypes profiles.
