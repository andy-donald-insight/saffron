ABSTRACT
We present BibBase, a system for publishing and managing
bibliographic data available in BibTeX files. BibBase uses a
powerful yet light-weight approach to transform BibTeX files
into rich triplified data as well as custom HTML and RSS
code that can readily be integrated within a users website
while the data can instantly be queried online on the systems SPARQL endpoint. In this short report, we present
a brief overview of the features of our system and outline a
few research challenges in building such a system.

INTRODUCTION

Management of bibliographic data has received significant
attention in the research community. Many online systems
have been designed specifically for this purpose, including
but certainly not limited to, BibSonomy [13], CiteSeer [14],
CiteULike [15], EPrints [16], Mendeley [17], PubZone [18],
refbase [19] and RefWorks [20]. The work in the semantic web community in this area has also resulted in several
tools (such as BiBTeX to RDF conversion tools [7]), ontologies (such as SWRC ontology [10]) and data sources (such as
DBLP Berlin [11] and RKBExplorer [21]). These systems,
tools, and data sources are widely being used and have considerably simplified and enhanced many bibliographic data
management tasks such as data curation, storage, retrieval,
and sharing of bibliographic data.

Despite the success of the above-mentioned systems, very
few individuals and research groups publish their bibliographic data on their websites in a structured format, particularly following the principles of Linked Data [1], to provide

users with HTTP dereferenceable URIs that provide structured (RDF) data as well as nicely formatted HTML pages.
This is mainly due to the fact that existing systems either are
not designed to be used within an external website, or they
require expert users to set up complex software systems on
machines that meet the requirements of this software. BibBase [12] aims to fill this gap by providing several distinctive
features as described in the following sections.
2. LIGHT-WEIGHT LINKED DATA PUBLI-

CATION

BibBase makes it easy for scientists to maintain publication lists on their personal web site. Scientists simply maintain a BiBTeX file of their publications, and BibBase does
the rest. When a user visits a publication page, BibBase
dynamically generates an up-to-date HTML page from the
BiBTeX file, as well as rich linked data with resolvable URIs
that can be queried instantly on the systems SPARQL end-
point. Compared to existing linked data publication tools,
this approach is notably easy-to-use and light-weight, and
allows non-expert users to create a rich linked data source
without any specific server requirements, the need to set up
a new system, or define complex mapping rules. All they
need to know is how to create and maintain a BiBTeX file
and there are tools to help with that.

It is important to note that this ease of use does not sacrifice the quality of the published data. In fact, although the
system is light-weight on the users side, BibBase performs
complex processing of the data in the back-end. When a
new or updated BiBTeX file arrives, the system transforms
the data into several structured formats using a rich ontol-
ogy, assigns URIs to all the objects (authors, papers, venues,
etc.), performs duplicate detection and semantic linkage,
and maintains and publishes provenance information as described below.
3. DUPLICATE DETECTION

BibBase needs to deal with several issues related to the
heterogeneity of records in a single BiBTeX file, and across
multiple BiBTeX files. BibBase uses existing duplicate detection techniques in addition to a novel way of managing
duplicated data following the linked data principles. Within
a single BiBTeX file, the system uses a set of rules to identify duplicates and fix errors. We refer to this phase as
local duplicate detection. For example, if a BiBTeX file has
two occurrences of author names J. B. Smith and John
B. Smith, the system matches the two author names and
creates only a single author object. In this example, the assumption is that the combination of the first letter of first


name, middle name, and last name, JBSmith, is a unique
identifier for a person in a single file. If this assumption does
not hold for a specific user (which is unlikely) BibBase allows
the user to distinguish two people with the same identifier
by adding a number at the end of one of the author names.
For identification of duplicates across multiple BiBTeX
files, which we call global duplicate detection, the assumptions made for local duplicate detection may not hold. Within
different publication lists, JBSmith may (or may not) refer to the same author. BibBase deals with this type of
uncertainty by having a disambiguation page on the HTML
interface that informs the users looking for author name J.
B. Smith (by looking up the URI http://data.bibbase.
org/author/j-b-smith) of the existence of all the entities
with the same identifier, and having skos:closeMatch and
rdfs:seeAlso properties that link to related author entities
on the RDF interface.

Duplicate detection, also known as entity resolution, record
linkage, or reference reconciliation is a well-studied problem
and an attractive research area [5]. We use some of the existing techniques to define local and global duplicate detection
rules, for example using fuzzy string similarity measures [4]
or semantic knowledge for matching conference names and
paper titles [6].
In addition to the definition of rules and
online duplicate detection, we also uses some graph-based
duplicate detection techniques [8] (also known as collective
entity resolution [2]) to identify duplicates in an offline man-
ner. However, in order to avoid loss of user data as a result
of imperfect data cleaning, the results of this process will
be published as additional data on our system that result in
disambiguation pages or skos:closeMatch predicates.

4. DISCOVERING SEMANTIC LINKS TO

EXTERNAL DATA SOURCES

In order to publish our data in the Web, not just on the
Web, to avoid creation of an isolated data silo, and to add
BibBase data to the growing Linking Open Data cloud of
data sources, we need to discover links from the entities in
BibBase to entities from external data sources. Figure 1
shows a sample of entities in BibBase and several possible

links to related linked data sources and web pages. In order
to discover such links, similar to our duplicate detection ap-
proach, we can leverage online and offline solutions. The online approach mainly uses a dictionary of terms and strings
that can be mapped to external data sets. An important
type of links comes from keywords in BiBTeX entries that
can be used to relate publications to entries on DBpedia
(and pages on Wikipedia), such as DBpedia entities of type
buzzword shown in the example figure. A similar approach
is used to match abbreviated venues, such as ISWC to
International Semantic Web Conference. The dictionaries
(or ontology tables) are maintained inside BibBase, and derived from sources such as DBpedia, Freebase, Wordnet, and
DBLP. We also allow the users to extend the dictionaries by
@string definitions in their BiBTeX files, e.g.,
@string{ISWC={Proc. of the Intl Semantic Web Conference(ISWC)}}
An offline link discovery can be performed using existing

link discovery tools [6, 9].
5. PROVENANCE AND USER FEEDBACK
Another highlight of the features implemented in BibBase
is storage and publication of provenance information, i.e.,
the source of each entity and each link in the data. This is
of utmost importance in a system like BibBase where the
data comes from several different users and BiBTeX files,
and where (imperfect) automatic duplicate detection and
linkage is performed over the data. Users will be able to see
the source of entities and the facts about the entities.
In
addition, they will be able to fix their own BiBTeX files or
provide feedback to the system and to other users who need
to fix their files or provide additional information.

User feedback is another important aspect of BibBase
Feedback is received in two forms. The first and major
part of feedback comes from the BiBTeX files. For example,
as stated in Sec. 3, users can distinguish different authors
with the same name by adding a number to the end of their
names. Similarly, as stated in Sec. 4, users can provide
string equivalences to enhance our internal ontology tables
for semantic linkage as well as duplicate detection. Another
form of feedback comes from the web interface (currently under development), where the users can report broken links,

own BiBTeX entries.

By providing feedback, users will not only increase the
quality of the data published on their own websites, they
will also create a very high-quality data source in the long
run that could become a benchmark for the notoriously hard
task of evaluating duplicate detection and semantic link discovery systems.
6. BIBTEX ONTOLOGY DEFINITION

Using terms from existing vocabularies to publish data
in RDF, is recognized as a best practice by the linked
data community [3]. Several different vocabularies exist
for bibliographic data. We have chosen to use one that is
specifically designed for BiBTeX data (as opposed to the
more general vocabularies), namely MITs BiBTeX ontology definition available at http://zeitkunst.org/bibtex/
0.1/. However, we also need to extend the vocabulary in
several aspects to meet the requirements of our system,
and address some shortcomings of existing ontologies (e.g.,
those noted by Herman [7]). Some of these changes include addition of a new class keyword and addition of a new
property firstAuthor for publication entries which facilitate grouping and querying publications based on keywords
and first authors. The new namespace will be available at
http://zeitkunst.org/bibtex/0.2/.
7. ADDITIONAL FEATURES

The success of BibBase as a linked data source depends
on scientists using BibBase for their publications pages. To
further entice scientists to do so, BibBase sports a number
of additional features that make it an attractive solution for
this purpose.
 Dynamic, multi-level grouping of publications based on

different attributes (e.g., by year or keyword).
 Customizable appearance via CSS style sheets.
 An RSS feed, allowing anyone to receive notifications

whenever a specified scientist publishes a new paper.

 A DBLP fetch tool that allows scientists who do not yet
have a BiBTeX file to obtain their DBLP publications to
start using BibBase right away.

 Statistics regarding users, page views, and paper down-

loads, including a list of most popular papers.

We are currently working on a few additional features
such as a generic keyword search interface that accounts
for spelling errors, abbreviations, and semantic mismatches,
and a visual navigator for the RDF data specifically designed
to find correlations between the authors, papers, and key-
words. We will also create an RSS feed for every keyword
being used, so that anyone can be notified when new papers
in that area are published.

8. ONLINE DEMO

The HTML and RSS interface of BibBase, available at
http://bibbase.org, is fully functional and in active use by
several groups and individuals. As of June 2010, the data
interface, http://data.bibbase.org, is still in the experimental phase and the available online demo only showcases
a subset of the features explained in this report. Documentation and current status of the experimental features of the
data interface are available at http://wiki.bibbase.org.

9. CONCLUSION

We presented BibBase, a system for light-weight publication of bibliographic data on personal or research group
websites, and management of the data using existing semantic technologies as a result of the complex triplification
performed inside the system. BibBase extends the linking open data cloud with a data source that unlike existing bibliographic data sources, allows online manipulation
of the data by non-expert users. We plan to continue to
extend the features of BibBase. A list of currently implemented and upcoming experimental features is available at
http://wiki.bibbase.org.
