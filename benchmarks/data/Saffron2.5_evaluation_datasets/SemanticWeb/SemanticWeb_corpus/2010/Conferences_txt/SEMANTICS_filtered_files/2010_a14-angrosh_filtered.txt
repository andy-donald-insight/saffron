ABSTRACT 
Research  articles  are  an 
scientific 
communication. However, currently there are hardly any systems 
which  exploit  the  content  of  research  articles  for  information 
retrieval. The paper describes our work carried out in developing 
ontology-based  information  retrieval  system  using  information 
extracted  about  sentences  in  research  articles.  We  present  results 
of  a  supervised  learning  mechanism  using  conditional  random 
fields  for  context  identification  and  sentence  classification  of 
sentences  in  the  related  work  section  of  research  articles.  The 
labelling  of  sentences  is  carried  out  based  on  a  classification 
framework,  which  we  propose  for  classifying  sentences  in  these 
sections.  We  proceed  to  develop  a  sentence  context  ontology  for 
modelling  the  classified  data  obtained  through  CRFs.  We  also 
show  how  the  ontology  is  further  used  for  creating  RDF  data. 
Finally, we describe the user interface developed using SEWESE 
tags and SPARQL for querying the developed RDF data.

1.  INTRODUCTION 
For centuries now, research articles have played an important role 
in  communicating  scientific  research.  Ever  since 
the  first 
scientific  journal  Philosophical  Transactions  was  published  by 
the Royal Society of London in the year 1665 [2], the number of 
scientific  journals  has  increased  beyond  ones  imagination. 
However,  this  exponential  growth  has  also  resulted  in  serious 
challenges  for  the  scientific  community.  While  the  rapid  growth 
of  scientific  literature  has  led  to  difficulties  for  scientists  in 
accessing  all  relevant  articles  in  their  fields,  it  is  becoming  only 
next to impossible to read all those relevant articles. At the same

time,  the  information  seeking  behaviour  of  researchers  is  fast 
changing  with  increasing  need  for  more  value-added  and  userfriendly information retrieval systems. 

Though  a  range  of  search  mechanisms  are  provided  by  current 
search  engines  and  information  providers,  most  of  these  services 
are  centred  on  full-text  search  or  limited  to  bibliographic 
metadata,  which 
fundamental 
questions. For instance, at an elementary level, a researcher would 
be interested in knowing and understanding the related work used 
by an author for progressing  the authors ideas and shortcomings 
of  related  works  which  motivated  the  authors  work.  This  forms 
the  key  in  establishing  the  linkages  between  research  ideas  and 
research articles. However, currently there are hardly any systems 
capable of answering these questions. 

In  order  to  obtain  answers  to  the  above  questions,  we  need 
systems which have additional knowledge about documents other 
than  the  basic  metadata.  This  can  be  obtained  through  extracting 
information  embedded  in  articles  about  related  works  and  the 
contexts in which these related works are used for progressing the 
authors ideas. However, extracting information about the content 
and  its  entities  is  a  major  challenge.  Against  this  motivation,  the 
present  research 
intelligent 
information systems using information extracted about the context 
of  sentences  in  research  articles.  The  paper  presents  results  of  a 
supervised  learning  mechanism  using  conditional  random  fields 
for  context  identification  and  sentence  classification  of  sentences 
in  the  related  work  section  of  research  articles.  The  labelling  of 
sentences  is  carried  out  based  on  a  classification  framework, 
which we propose for classifying sentences in these sections. We 
proceed to develop a sentence context ontology for modelling the 
through  conditional  random  fields 
classified  data  obtained 
(CRFs).  We  also  show  how  the  ontology  is  further  used  for 
creating RDF data and user interface using SPARQL for querying 
the  developed  RDF  data.  The  paper  is  structured  as  follows. 
Section  2  describes  the  related  work  carried  out  in  the  field  of 
modelling  sentences  in  research  articles.  We  also  draw  upon 
recent  studies  on  the  use  of  ontologies  for  modelling  scientific 
articles  and  CRFs  for  sequential  learning.  While  describing  the 
rhetorical  pattern  observed  in  related  work  sections  of  research 
papters,  Section  3  puts  forward  the  proposed  classification 
framework  for  sentences  in  related  work  section.  Section  4 
explains  the  experiments  carried  out  using  CRFs  for  classifying 
sentences  and  presents  the  results  obtained.  Section  5  details  the 
development  of  Sentence  Context  Ontology  and  retrieval  system 
developed  using  the  Ontology.  The  conclusion  of  the  paper  is 
provided in Section 6.

There  have  been  efforts  in  modelling  information  contained  in 
research  articles  for  information  retrieval.  Sillence  proposed  an 
argumentation  based  indexing  method  for  information  retrieval 
from  learned  articles  [3].  Buckingham  Shum  et  al.  propose  an 
argumentation  scheme  for  modelling  the  rhetorical  pattern  in 
research  articles  [4].  The  study  implemented  a  client-server 
system  called  ClaiMaker,  which  facilitated  distributed  modelling 
of  documents  in  literature  and  provided  a  variety  of  services  for 
browsing  and  analysing  the  emergent  conceptual  graphs.  Sereno 
et  al.  developed  ClaimSpotter,  an  environment  for  supporting 
sense  making  with  knowledge  triples  [5].  De  Waard  presented  a 
pragmatic structure for research articles [6]. Further De Waard et 
al.  proposed  a  model  for  research  publications  to  structure 
scientific  articles,  based  on  the  rhetorical  structure  ubiquitous  in 
science  papers  [7].  Teufel  et  al.  developed  an  annotation  scheme 
of seven categories for building automatic abstracting systems for 
scientific research articles [8]. Further, Teufel and Moens noted a 
common  rhetorical  pattern  of  scientific  argumentation  in  the 
introduction section of research articles [9].  

On the other hand, there has been considerable amount of work on 
developing ontologies for scientific discourse. The SWAN project 
(Semantic Web Applications in Neuromedicine) aims to develop a 
practical,  common, 
for 
scientific  discourse  [10].  The  project  is  currently  applied  to  the 
field of Alzheimer Disease research and is expected to be applied 
to  other  domains.  The  project  has  also  developed  the  Citations 
ontology,  which  defines  a  set  of  entities  useful  for  referencing 
scientific  publications  [11].  The  present  study  uses  the  Citations 
ontology for defining the entities of scientific publications. 

While  most  of  the  studies  for  modelling  sentences  in  research 
articles  prominently  adopt  argumentation  models,  we  follow  a 
generic  rhetorical  pattern  observed  in  research  articles  for 
modelling  sentences.  Further,  although  the  final  objective  of  the 
present  work  is  to  model  sentences  appearing  throughout  the 
article, we present here the results of our experiments carried out 
specifically  on  related  work  sections  in  research  articles.  The 
presence of a large number of citations in the related work section 
is  the  primary  motivation  for  choosing  this  section. Furthermore, 
we  view  the  classification  task  as  a  sequential  classification 
problem  and  assume  that  authors  follow  a  sequential  rhetorical 
pattern  while  drawing  upon  related  work.  The  sequential 
classification  is  achieved  by  using  conditional  random  fields 
(CRFs)    a  probabilistic  framework  for  labelling  sequential  data 
based  on  supervised 
learning.  Recently,  CRFs  have  been 
successfully applied to various tasks such as Part of Speech (POS) 
tagging [12]; named entity recognition [13]; table extraction from 
government reports [14] and noun phrase segmentation [15]. 

semantically-structured 

framework 

refer to the outcome or strengths of a related work. The distinction 
between  description  and  referring  to  an  outcome  or  strength  is 
purposely  made  for  achieving  a  finer  representation  of  relations 
between the cited work and the citing author.  

The  citations  are  usually  observed  to  be  followed  by  a  set  of 
sentences  which  further  describe  or  point  out  the  outcome  or 
strengths  of  the  related  work.  Following  such  sentences,  the 
author  generally  points  out  shortcomings  in  the  related  work. 
Besides  identifying  shortcomings,  there  could  also  be  sentences 
referring to contrasting work  for  the cited work.  Pointing out the 
shortcomings  is  necessary  for  progressing  the  authors  argument 
and  provides  a  link  with  the  successive  sentences  referring  to 
newer  cited  works.  After  identifying  shortcomings,  the  author 
proceeds to usually point out alternate works which overcome the 
identified  shortcomings.  These  could  also  be  citations  or  regular 
sentences which refer to alternate approaches for a given study. 

Finally, in relation to the description or reference to an outcome or 
strengths  of  a  cited  work,  its  shortcomings,  and  alternate 
approaches,  the  authors  describe  the  outcomes  of  the  current 
work.  The  authors  also  sometimes  mention  shortcomings  in  the 
current work. It needs to be noted that it is not necessary that the 
above  identified  pattern  is  rigidly  followed  in  a  water-tight 
manner in these sections across all papers. The style varies across 
papers  in  accordance  with  the  writing  style  of  authors.  The 
proposed framework is a generic pattern obtained after studying a 
series of related work sections in different papers. The framework 
is developed with an objective of using the structure for obtaining 
semantic  data  for  developing  intelligent  information  retrieval 
systems. Further, it should also be noted that the CRF-based tool 
used in this study is capable of learning other rhetorical structures. 

The generic rhetorical pattern observed in the related work section 
is diagrammatically shown in Figure 1.

3.  Rhetorical Pattern in Related Work Section 
The related work section in a research article is primarily used by 
an  author  for  drawing  upon  the related  work  in  the  research  area 
and expressing his/her ideas in the context of the identified related 
work.  A  closer  look  at  these  sections  reveals  a  common  generic 
rhetorical pattern in these paragraphs. The section usually begins 
with  a  background  sentence,  which  provides  background 
information  or  an  introduction  to  the  related  research  area  and 
then  continues  by  pointing  to  specific  related  work,  which  is  of 
interest  in  the  context  of  the  authors  idea.  The  latter,  popularly 
known  as  citations,  either  simply  describe  the  related  work  or

The  categories  obtained  from  this  classification  schema  are  used 
for  labeling  sentences  in  the  related  work  section.  The  following 
section  presents  our  work  carried  out  using 
the  above 
classification schema with CRFs for extracting information. 

4.  EXPERIMENTS WITH CRFs 
4.1 Conditional Random Fields 
Conditional Random Fields (CRFs)  [17] are undirected graphical 
models  used  for  computing  the  conditional  probability  of  values 
on designated output nodes given feature values assigned to other 
designated input nodes. CRFs offer several advantages over other 
sequential  models  such  as  Hidden  Markov  Models  (HMMs).  As 
discriminative  models,  CRFs  do  not  model  interdependence 
among  observed  data  nor  do 
independence 
assumptions on the observations. The framework  allows rich and 
unconstrained  feature  representation  that  could  overlap  or  refer 
arbitrarily  to  the  observation.  Higher  performance  is  achieved 
with  CRFs  as  they  are  normalized  over  the  full  sequence, 
overcoming  the  label-bias  problem,  a  weakness  found  in 
maximum  entropy  Markov  models  (MEMMs)  [21]  and  other 

impose 

they 

conditional Markov models based on directed graphical models.  

Let  x  =  x1....xT  be  an  input  sequence  and  y  =  y1....yT  be  a 
corresponding  state  (or  label)  sequence.  Generally  it  is  assumed 
that the dependencies of y, the state sequence, conditioned over x 
form  a  linear  chain  i.e.,  each  state  depends  only  on  its 
predecessor.  A  linear  chain  CRF  with  parameters    =  {1,....} 
defines a conditional probability for y given x to be  

P y x  =  

 yt1, yt, x,   t  .   (1) 

exp      k

T
t=1

 fk

Z(x)

where Z(x) is a normalisation factor that makes the probabilities 
of  all  label  sequences  sum  to  one,  fk yt1, yt , x,   t   is  a  feature 
function and k  is a learned weight associated with feature fk .  

A  feature  function  measures  the  state  transition  yt1  yt   and 
the  observation  sequence,  x centered  at  the  current  time  step  t. 
For example, as in our case, a feature function may take value 1 if 
the  current  state  yt   is  RWD  a  sentence  describing  related  work, 
the previous state yt1 is RWD_CS a citation sentence describing 
related work and the observation xt  is a Description Term, or the 
value 0 otherwise (Figure 1).

y = argmax P y x  

Inference  in  CRFs  is  done  by  finding  the  most  probable  label 
sequence y, for an input sequence x, given in model (1): 

This  is  calculated  by  dynamic  programming  using  the  Viterbi 
algorithm. 

The  learning  task  in  a  CRF  is  to  choose  values  for  the  weights 
(also  called  parameters).  Given  a  set  of  training  examples,  the 
goal is to choose parameter values  = {1,....} that maximize the 
conditional  probability  of  the  training  examples.  Parameter 
estimation in CRF is carried out in an iterative procedure such as 
limited  memory  quasi-Newton  method  (L-BFGS),  stochastic 
gradient method or voted perceptron. 

4.2 Feature Selection 
The  most  important  aspect of  specifying  the  model  is  selecting  a 
set of features that capture the relationship between each sentence 
and  the  label  sequences.  We  distinguish  between  two  kinds  of 
features  for  each  sentence  viz.,  citation  features  and  sentence 
features. While citation features  denote the presence of a citation 
in  sentences,  sentence  features  are  defined  based  on  a 
generalization  strategy  adopted  in  the  study.  The  generalization 


are  used  as  features  for  each  sentence.  The  following  section 
details  the  adopted  generalization  method  and  the  process  of 
defining features based on it. 

4.2.1 Generalization of Terms 
In  order  to  classify  sentences  into  different  contexts  our 
generalization  process  identifies  the  presence  of  certain  kinds  of 
words  which  signify  the  context  of  a  given  sentence.  This 
involves  identifying  the  following  nine  categories  for  terms  used 
by authors in research writing. 

1. 

Inquiry Terms  These are primarily the reporting verbs used 
in  academic  writing.  Examples  of  inquiry  terms  include 
examine, propose, state. 

2.  Outcome  Terms  -  These  terms  also  appear  in  the  form  of 
reporting verbs and are mainly used refer to the outcomes of 
the  cited  works.  Examples  of  these  terms  include  show, 
develop. 

3.  Strength Terms  Again, these terms are reporting verbs but 
mainly  describe  the  strengths  of  cited  works.  Examples  of 
these terms include improve, better performance, aids. 

4.  Shortcoming  Terms  in  Related  Work  -  These  are  the  terms 
generally  used  by  authors  to  denote  shortcomings.  The 
shortcomings can be identified in either the cited work or the 
current  work.  Examples  of  SCT  terms  include  Nevertheless, 
do not, however, but.  

5.  Subjective  Pronouns    Subjective  pronouns  are  primarily 
terms that are used as the subject of a sentence. These terms 
are  used  by  authors  to  refer  to  cited  works.  Prominently, 
these  terms  appear  in  the  Descriptive  Sentences  following 
citations. Examples of these terms include They, The authors, 
In 

6.  Words of Stress - These terms are generally used to stress the 
importance of a point made by the authors. Examples of such 
terms include Moreover, In addition, Therefore. 

7.  Alternate Approach Terms - These are the terms used by the 
author  for  referring  to  alternate  approaches  for  overcoming 
the  shortcomings  identified  in  a  cited  work.  Examples  of 
these terms include may be, Another approach, alternative, 

8.  Result  Terms  -  These  are  terms  that  mainly  describe  the  we 

have shown, our work shows, this paper.  

9.  Contrasting Terms  These are terms that are used to make a 
contrasting statement for a given work. For example, phrases 
such as In Contrast, our work differs from that of... are strong 
indicators of contrasting terms.   

4.2.2 Feature Definition 
Based  on  the  above  categorization,  we  define  sentence  features 
for  each  sentence  in  the  related  work  section.  While  most  of  the 
features  for  a  sentence  are  defined  based  on  identification  and 
matching  of  terms  belonging  to  different  categories  as  defined 
above,  some  features  are  defined  in  accordance  with  certain 
conditions  defined  in  this  experiment.  Thus,  we  distinguish 
between two categories of features, with the former called simple 
features and the latter compound features.  Simple features are 
created  for  a  sentence  if  there  is  a  match  against  the  terms 
identified  through  the  generalization  strategy  discussed  above. 
Table  2  lists  the  defined  simple  features.  Table  2  also  identifies 
citation  features  under  this  category.  Citation  features  indicate 
whether a given sentence contains a citation or not.

Xu  and  Saadawi  [3]  evaluate  the  performance  of  TCP  over 
wireless chains. They demonstrate that TCP traffic in a chain has 
instability problems that degrade chain throughput.  

Compound  features  on  the  other  hand  are  created  for  a  sentence 
based  on  some  conditions  laid  down  for  this  study.  It  was 
observed  in  our  study  that  terms  belonging  to  the  category  of 
Subject  of  Inquiry  appeared  more  commonly  in  both  citation 
sentences  and  their  consecutive  sentences.  This  resulted  in 
difficulties  in  defining  the  category  of  terms  that  characterize  a 
given sentence. For instance consider the following sentences:  

As  may  be  seen  in  the  above  sentences,  terms  such  as  evaluate 
and demonstrate belonging to the category of Subject of Inquiry 
(SOI) appear both in the citation sentence as well as the sentence 
following  the  citation.  Following  the  principle  of  simple  features 
described  earlier,  the  resulting  feature  for  these  two  sentences 
would  be  sentHasTerm=SOI.  However,  the  class  to  which  these 
two  sentences  belong  is  different.  While  the  first  sentence  is  a 
citation  sentence  describing  the  related  work  and  belongs  to  the 
class  of  RWD_CS1,  the  second  sentence  which  is  not  a  citation 
belongs  to  the  class  of  RWD2  and  is  related  to  the  previous 
sentence,  further  describing  the  work  cited  earlier.  Thus,  same 
feature  for  both  the  sentences  would  result  in  the  classifier 
classifying both the sentences in the same category.  

In  order  to  create  this  distinction  and  allow  the  classifier  to 
classify  the  sentences  in  different  classes,  we  define  different 
features  for  these  sentences  based  on  the  presence  of  a  citation 
and  an  SOI  term  Table  3  provides  the  details  of  the  defined 
conditions and these corresponding compound features:

Thus,  we  define  a  total  of  13  features  primarily  distinguished  as 
simple  and  compound  features  and  a  subset  of  these  features 
would form the feature set for a given sentence in our experiment.  

4.3 Dataset 
The  dataset  was  developed  from  50  research  articles  randomly 
selected  from  the  Lecture  Notes  in  Computer  Science  (LNCS) 
collection  at  springerlink.com  [16].  The  related  work  section  in 
each of these articles was extracted for the purpose of this study. 
The  training  set  of  50  research  articles  yielded  200  paragraphs 
which  had  a  total  of  1063  sentences.  Each  paragraph  was 
represented  as  a  sequence  of  sets  of  features  with  each  sentence 
manually 
the 
methodology described above.  

Two different datasets were prepared from the training set. While 
the  first  dataset  was  developed  using  only  sentence  features,  the 
second  dataset  was  developed  using  both  citation  features  and 
sentence features. The following illustrates the difference between 
two sets of features for a sample paragraph:

Several  researchers  have  been  studying  the  behavior  of  chains  in 
MHWNs.  Li  et  al.  examine  the performance  of  chains as  the number  of 
hops  are  increased  and  study  the  effect  of  cross-interference  between 
chains  [5].  They  analyze  the  effect  of  MAC  802.11  behaviour  on  the 
performance  of  multi-hop  chains  but  do  not  categorize  interference 
patterns  that  govern  network  performance  in  terms  of  throughput  and 
bandwidth utilization. Ping et al. present a hop by hop analysis of a multihop chain, study the impact of hidden terminals on the throughput chains, 
and  present  a  quantitative  approach  towards  estimating  this  throughput 
[6]. They show that hidden terminals cause packet drops affecting chain

In  the  present  study,  for  training  the  CRF  model,  we  used 
MALLET 
that  provides  an 
implementation of linear chain CRF algorithms  for  working  with 
sequential data. 

A  10-fold  cross  validation  was  carried  out  on  each  dataset,  for 
which the dataset was split to obtain 10 sets of individual test data 
and training data in the ratio of 9:1. 

4.4 Results 
We  report  for  each  classification  label,  the  precision,  recall  and 
the F-score. The F-score is computed as follows: 

P =  

|TP |

 TP  + |FP |

;  R =  

 TP  + |FN |

;  F =  

2 PR

P+R

where P represents precision, R represents recall, TP is the set of 
true positives, TN is the set of true negatives, and FP is the set of 
false  negatives.  We  also  report  the  accuracy,  defined  as  the 
percentage of correctly labelled sentences. 

The  results  showing  precision,  recall  and  F-score  for  each  of  the 
classification labels are tabulated in Table 3. As may be seen from 
Table 3, the classifier achieves a higher accuracy of 96.51% when 
trained  with  the  combination  of  both  citation  features  and 
sentence features as against a lower accuracy of 93.22% obtained 
when  trained  with  sentence  features  alone.  This  implies  that  the 
use  of  citation  features  for  modelling  sequential  flow  plays  an 
important role in achieving higher accuracy. The use of combined 
features also helps in achieving a high F-score for various classes.  
While  the  classes  of  BG,  RWD_CS,  RWSC,  RWD,  CWO  and 
RWS  obtained  a  high F-score  of  0.99,  0.98,  0.98,  0.97,  0.96  and 
0.90 respectively through the use of combined features, the same 
classes  achieved  a  lower  F-score  of  0.93,  0.97,  0.94,  0.92,  0.94 
and  0.59  respectively  by  using  sentence  features  alone.  It  is  also 
observed that fewer classes obtained a lower F-score ranging from 
0.72  to  0.24.  This  could  be  attributed  to  the  fact  that  there  are 
fewer  occurrences  of  instances  in  these  classes  and  could  be 
considerably  improved  by  developing  additional  training  data. 
However,  it  needs  to  be  noted  that  the  use  of  both  the  features 
helped  in  achieving  higher  F-scores  for  these  low-performing 
classes as against the use of sentence features alone.

The classification data obtained from CRFs facilitates in explicitly 
classifying  sentences  into  different  categories  and  drawing 
relations  between  them.  The  classification  schema  can  be 
represented with an ontology, which can then be used for creating 
semantically  enriched  data  capable  of  providing  value  added 
information  services.  With  this  objective,  we  developed  the 
Sentence  Context  Ontology  for  representing  the  contextual 
relations  of  sentences  in  research  articles.  Figure  3  outlines  the 
schema  of  the  developed  ontology  in  OWL.  The  ontology  was 
developed  using  the  Protege  Ontology  Editor  and  Knowledgebase Framework [19].  

As  seen  from  the  figure,  different  categories  of  sentences  are 
identified 
include 
BackgroundSentence,  ResultSentence,  CurrentWorkShortcoming 
Sentence, ShortcomingSentence, AlternativeSentence, Descriptive 
Sentence  and  CitationSentence.  The  categories  of  Alternative 
Sentence,  Descriptive  Sentence,  Shortcoming  Sentence  and 
the  category  of 
Citation  Sentence  are  grouped  under 
property 
CitationRelatedSentence 
object 
relatedToCitationSentence 
the 
CitationRelatedSentence  as  the  domain  and  its  subclasses  as  the 
range  of  the  object  property.  This  categorization  and  relating  of 
sentences  facilitates  in  retrieving  related  descriptive,  alternative 
and shortcoming sentences for a given citation sentence. The class 
of  shortcoming  sentences  of  the  current  work  is  defined  as  the 
subclass of result sentences so as to link these kinds of sentences. 

The ontology also defines the Author class, Publication class and 
the  Citation  class  for  categorizing  information  related  to  the 
authors, 
the 
hasSourceArticle  property  relates  the  Sentence  Class  and  the 
Citation  Class  with  the  Publication  class,  the  hasCitation 
property binds the Citation class with the Publication class.  

The  publication  class  refers  to  the  document  in  question  and  is 
defined with various RDF properties for describing  bibliographic 
data  such  as  abstract,  title,  ISSN,  ISBN,  pages,  DOI,  etc.  The 
is  defined  with  data  properties  such  as 
Sentence  class 
sentenceText,  hasSentenceFeature  and  hasLabel  for  relating  the 
sentence  related  data.  The  Sentence  Context  ontology  adopts  the 
Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI) Type  and Bibliographic 
Ontology  vocabularys  definition  for  defining 
the  various 
bibliographic properties of published documents.  

The  N3  format  of  the  Sentence  Context  Ontology  is  provided  in

5.1 Creating RDF Data

Source:Flores et al (2010) [20] 

Also  in  Portuguese,  Alvares  et  al.[2]  compare  STEMBR,  RLSP 
and  Portuguese  Porter  stemmers.  The  study  concludes  that 
STEMBR  is  heavier  than  Porter  and  RSLP  and  thus  makes 
slightly fewer understemming errors than RSLP and Porter. Both 
papers,  however,  have  not  used  the  ERRT  metric  in  their 
evaluation.  Also  none  of  them  assesses  the  effects  of  their 
stemmers over retrieval performance. 

The following illustrates the derivation of RDF data for a sample 
paragraph: 

As  may  be  seen  in  the  paragraph,  the  first  sentence  is  a  citation 
sentence  describing  a  related  work.  The  second  sentence  is  a 
descriptive  sentence  which  further  describes  the  cited  work. 
However,  the  third  and  the  fourth  sentences  are  shortcoming 
sentences  mentioning  the  limitations  of  the  cited  work.  The 
following 
the  semantically  mapped  contextual 
information  derived  for  the  above  paragraph  based  on  the 
application of CRFs described earlier. 

Listing 2 represents the RDF data created for Sentence 1. As seen, 
the  sentence  is  identified  as  a  citation  sentence  with  the  label 
RWD_CS 
sentHasCitation 
sentHasTerm=SOI_CIT.  The  mapping  of  various  bibliographic 
details of the article can be seen in the listing.

5.2 Ontology-based Information Retrieval System 

The  created  RDF  data  is  used  along  with  Semantic  Web  Server 
(SEWESE) [21], a JSP/Servlet environment built upon the Corese 
engine  that  provide  a  set  of  primitives  for  building  interfaces  for 
queries  and  navigation  of  semantic  data  for  creating  ontology 
based  retrieval  system.  Screenshots  of  the  developed  information 
system  are  provided  in  Figures  4(a)  and  4(b).  The  system  has 
several  entry  points  for  information  search.  We  have  used  the 
ACM  Computing  Classification  System  for  subject  classification 
for  browsing  the  titles  according  to  the  classification  schema. 
Users can also search for information in the titles and abstracts of 
articles. Queries can also be performed for searching authors, both 
in  source  articles  and  references.  The  system  employs  SPARQL 
queries for retrieving information.  

For instance the following query retrieves all titles and doi for the 
specific term Portuguese, with  search limited to titles of source 
articles: 

Retrieve all titles for a specific term 

"SELECT ?title ?doi WHERE  

{?x sentcon:Article_doi ?doi .  
 ?x sentcon:Article_title ?title . 
 FILTER regex  
 (?title, 'Portuguese', 'i') } 
 ORDER BY ?title LIMIT 10" 

The doi information is extracted  along with the title information, 
so as to use the same for subsequent queries. Upon the retrieval of 
titles for specific search terms, the information about cited works 


results are provided in Figure 4(a). The following query retrieves 
performs this information. 

Cited Works for a chosen title 

"SELECT ?sentence ?sentid WHERE  
{?x sentcon:CitationSentence_sentid ?sentid . 
?xsentcon:CitationSentence_sentenceText ?sentence. 
?x sentcon:CitationSentence_doi  '${doi}'  . 
?x sentcon:CitationSentence_hasLabel 'RWD_CS' .} " 

Results of the chosen title 

"SELECT ?cwo WHERE  
{?x sentcon:CitationSentence_sentenceText ?cwo . 
 ?x sentcon:CitationSentence_doi  '${doi}'  .  
 ?x sentcon:CitationSentence_hasLabel 'CWO'  . }" 

The user can then select a specific cited work and view the related 
additional descriptive sentences and shortcoming sentences for the 
cited work. The search results are provided in Figure 4(b).

There are similar queries written to view the outcomes of related 
work used in the article and list related work that strongly support 
the  article.  Queries  are  also  written  to  list  all  the  source  articles 
and  contexts  in  which  a  specific  cited  work  is  used.  AJAX 
components  are  used  to  provide  a  more  user-friendly  interface. 
The systems facilitates in answering the following queries: 

1.  List current work outcomes and current work shortcomings 

of a research article 

2.  List the context of related work cited by author in the article 
3.  List  the  outcomes  of  related  work  mentioned by  the  author 

in the article 

4.  List related work which strongly support the article (related 

work strengths) 

5.  List the shortcomings of a specific cited work in an article 
6.  List alternative statements for a cited work (as opined by the 

author) 

7.  List contrasting work for a cited work 
8.  Identify the use of a cited work in different articles 
9.  Identify  the  context  in  which  a  cited  work  is  used  in 

different articles 

6 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK

The  present  paper  is  an  effort  to  extract  and  model  information 
about content embedded in research articles. To this end, we used 
conditional 
for 
identifying  the  context  of  sentences  in  related  work  sections  of 
research  articles.  The  classification  was  carried  out  based  on  a 
sequential  framework  developed  on  the  basis  of  the  generic 
rhetorical  pattern  observed  in  these  sections.  The  classification 
accuracy  of  96.51  %  achieved  with  the  use  of  sentence  and 
citation  features  points  out  the  usefulness  and  the  application  of 
the  technique.  We  also  proposed  the  Sentence  Context  Ontology 
for  modelling  sentences  in  related  work  sections  of  research 
articles.  We  showed  how  the  ontology  could  be  used  along  with 
the classified data for creating RDF data. Finally, we also showed 
the  web  application  developed  using  the  RDF  data.  The  results 
achieved are encouraging and open new ways to experiment with 
information  in  research  articles.  Our  future  tasks  would  mainly 
include modelling sentences appearing throughout the article and 
developing  larger  training  set  with  balanced  instances  in  various 
classes.  We  also  intend  to  develop  an  application  for  obtaining 
feedback  from  authors  regarding  the  correctness  of  classification 
of  sentences  in  the  article.  Finally  we  aim  at  developing  an 
ontology based information retrieval system based on an enhanced 
version of our ontology.
