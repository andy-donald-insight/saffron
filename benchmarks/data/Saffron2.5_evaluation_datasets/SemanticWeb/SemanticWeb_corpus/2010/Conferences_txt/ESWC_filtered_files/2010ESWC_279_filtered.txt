Abstract. Lots of RDF data have been published in the Semantic Web.
The RDF data model, together with the decentralized linkage nature of
the Semantic Web, brings object link structure to the worldwide scope.
Object links are critical to the Semantic Web and the macroscopic properties of object links are helpful for better understanding the current
Data Web. In this paper, we propose a notion of object link graph (OLG)
in the Semantic Web, and analyze the complex network structure of an
OLG constructed from the latest dataset (FC09) collected by the Falcons search engine. We find that the OLG has the scale-free nature and
the approximate effective diameter of the graph is small compared to its
scale, which are also consistent with the experimental result based on
our last years dataset (FC08). The amount of RDF documents and objects by Falcons both doubled during the past year, but the object link
graph remains the same density while the diameter is getting shrinking.
We also repeat the complex network analysis on the two largest domainspecific subsets of FC09, namely Bio2RDF(FC09) and DBpedia(FC09).
The results show that both Bio2RDF(FC09) and DBpedia(FC09) have
low density in object links, which contribute to the low density of object
links in FC09.

1 Introduction

In recent years, more and more RDF data have been published in the Web, and
most of them are created to describe objects by using shared classes and proper-
ties. From Aug. 2008 to Sept. 2009, the number of RDF documents collected by
the Falcons search engine [8] increases from 11.7M to 21.6M, with the number
of RDF triples from 600 million to 2.9 billion, as well as the numbers of objects,
classes and properties from 73.8M, 2.2M ,203K to 171.4M, 2.8M, 264K respec-
tively.1 As pointed out in [15], the Web is being extended with more and more
RDF data sources and links between objects, even across data sources. The RDF
data model, together with the decentralized linkage nature of the Semantic Web,
brings object link structure to the worldwide scope, where objects are identified
by URIs, and links are attributed to relational properties among objects.

The hypertext Web is considered to be a directed graph whose vertices correspond to Web pages and arcs correspond to hyperlinks between the pages, so

the page link graph in the hypertext Web is formed. We believe that the object
link structure is important to the Semantic Web, as the Web page link structure
to the hypertext Web.

Complex network analysis has been extensively performed on the page link
graph to reveal the macroscopic properties of the hypertext Web [1,2,3,6,12].
Recently, graph analysis techniques have also been applied to the schema level
of the Semantic Web, from single ontologies to a set of ontologies, even to the
whole Semantic Web [9,13,16,21,24]. However, to the best of our knowledge,
the macrostructure of the instance level of the Semantic Web has not yet been
well studied. We argue that a simple link structure of object links reveals some
useful macroscopic properties, which needs to be studied so that we can better
understand the macrostructure of the current Data Web.

In this paper, we propose a notion of object link graph (OLG) in the Semantic
Web, and analyze the complex network structure of an OLG constructed from
the latest dataset (FC09) collected by Falcons until Sept. 2nd, 2009. We find that
the OLG has the scale-free nature and the approximate effective diameter of the
graph is small compared to its scale. Then, by comparing this OLG with another
one constructed with our last years dataset (FC08), we confirm our findings.
Besides, the amount of RDF documents and objects in Falcons both doubled
during the past year, but the object link graph remains the same density and
its diameter is getting shrinking, which indicates a good evolution of the Data
Web. We also repeat the complex network analysis of OLG on the two largest
domain-specific subsets of FC09, namely Bio2RDF(FC09) and DBpedia(FC09).
The results show that both of Bio2RDF(FC09) and DBpedia(FC09) have a low
density in object links, which contributes to the low density of object links in
FC09.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives basic terminology used in this paper. Section 3 provides an overview of datasets used in
the experiments and introduces our experimental methodology. Section 4 analyzes the OLG constructed from FC09. Section 5 investigates the evolution of the
object link graph in the past year. In Section 6, we extract two domain-specific
OLGs and compare their structures with OLG in FC09. Section 7 discusses related work. Section 8 concludes the paper with some observations and possible
future work.

2 Terminologies

2.1 Graph

An undirected graph consists of a finite nonempty set of vertices V and a set
of edges E. An edge in E is an unordered pair (u, v) representing a connection
between two vertices u  V and v  V .

A connected component of an undirected graph is a subgraph in which any
two vertices are connected to each other by paths, and to which no more vertices
or edges can be added while preserving its connectivity. The number of vertices
in the connected component is called its size.
?

?

?
For each natural number d, let g(d) denote the fraction of connected node
pairs whose shortest connecting path has length at most d. The hop-plot for the
graph is the set of pairs (d, g(d)), which denotes the cumulative distribution of
distances between connected node pairs. We extend the hop-plot to a function
defined over all positive real numbers by linearly interpolating between the points
(d, g(d)) and (d + 1, g(d + 1)) for each d, and we define the effective diameter of
the graph to be the value of d at which this function achieves the value 0.9 [19].
A random variable x is distributed according to a power law when its proba-
, where A and  are positive
bility density function p(x) is given by p(x) = Ax
constants, and  is called the power law exponent. A power law distribution
plotted on a log-log scale is a line. A graph whose degree distribution follows a
power law is scale-free.

2.2 Objects in the Semantic Web

An entity is a named resource identified by a URI in RDF data. An entity e
is regarded as a class (or a property) in an RDF document if the RDF graph
encoded in the document entails the RDF triple e, rdf:type, rdfs:Class (or
e, rdf:type, rdf:Property), and it is regarded as an object if it is neither
a class nor a property. In accordance with [9], we require the disjointedness of
classes, properties, and objects, similar to OWL DL.

There may be more than one RDF documents in the Semantic Web that
describe the same resource but give inconsistent description. For example, it is
possible that a URI is stated to identify an object in one RDF document but to
identify a class in another document. Inspired by [9], we developed the following
heuristics to resolve the inconsistency. Firstly, we determine the identity of a URI
by considering only its dereference document. If such document is not available,
we will consider that a URI identifies an object only if no documents states that
it identifies a class or property.

It is noteworthy that we are only interested in named resources but ignore
blank nodes because a blank node cannot be directly referred outside the RDF
graph it is defined by. Thus, cross-document links never happen to blank nodes
so that they are not considered in the following Web-scale analysis. However,
blank nodes may indirectly contribute to the Web-scale object link structure,
which will be discussed in the next subsection.

2.3 Object Link Graph

An object link graph, denoted by (O, L), is an undirected graph, where O is
the vertex set, each is identified by a unique URI to represent an object; L
is the edge set, and each edge (u, v) exists iff there is a sequence of k triples
{ai, pi, bi|1  i  k}, where (a1, bk)  {(u, v), (v, u)} and bi = ai+1, bi are all
blank nodes for 1  i  k1. Here, we do not simply assume the directionality of
links between objects. According to this definition, blank nodes are not included
in an object link graph, but blank nodes may still contribute to establishing links
between objects.

Fig. 1(a) shows a fragment of an RDF graph, which is derived from an RDF
document identified by http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/card. From
this RDF graph, we obtain an object link graph, as shown in Fig. 1(b). In
particular, the link from http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/card#i to
http://dannyayers.com/me.rdf is attributed to the fact that there is a simple
path of length 2 via a blank node.

3 Datasets and Experimental Methodology

All the experimental results presented in this paper are obtained by analyzing
datasets collected by the Falcons search engine. This section firstly gives an
overview of the Falcons crawler. Then, datasets used in this paper are introduced.
At last, experimental procedure is presented.

3.1 Crawler

To ensure the coverage of the Falcons crawler, we feed it a set of seed URIs of
RDF documents from three sources. Firstly, we extract some keywords from the
Open Directory Project,2 and randomly combine them as queries in Swoogle3
and Google (for filetype:rdf and filetype:owl) to retrieve URIs of potential
RDF documents. Secondly, as many personal RDF data are stored on several
online repositories such as pingthesemanticweb.com, URIs of RDF documents
from these repositories are added to the seed set. Thirdly, as the largest data
source in the current Semantic Web, several entry-point URIs of the datasets
published in the Linking Open Data project are manually submitted.

A parallel crawler is implemented to dereference URIs with content negotiation (ACCEPT application/rdf+xml) and download RDF/XML documents.
Besides, this crawler follows the robots.txt protocol with the HTTP header
field User-Agent setting to Falconsbot. We do not use any filter rules or domain limits, as we want to get a relatively complete sample of the current Data
Web.

3.2 Datasets

We exported two snapshots of datasets from the Falcons crawler in August 26th,
2008 and September 2nd, 2009. The 2008s dataset contains 11,719,608 RDF
documents, and the 2009s dataset contains 21,639,337 RDF documents.

Fig. 2. A fragment taken from an RDF document in hi5.com

After inspecting the top-50 domains4 with most RDF documents, we find some
social networking sites have the similar publishing style, which use blank nodes
to identify objects instead of URIs. Fig. 2 shows a fragment taken from an RDF
document in hi5.com. In the fragment, a person with nickname Carlita (blank
node) knows another person Gabriela (blank node), and Gabriela has an FOAF
document http://api.hi5.com/rest/profile/foaf/212231607. Here, blank
nodes are used to identify persons. It is stressed that this publishing way seems
incompatible with the Linked Data principles [5], since it does not use URIs to
identify things and cannot interlink objects across data sources. Most of RDF
documents from hi5.com, mybloglog.com, buzznet.com, liveinternet.ru,
deadjournal.com and rambler.ru have the similar publishing style. So, we refine the datasets by excluding those RDF documents that come from the above
six domains, and the refined datasets are called FC08 (Falcons Crawl 2008)
and FC09 (Falcons Crawl 2009) respectively.

We find that FC08 has 11,286,186 RDF documents coming from 10,216 domains and FC09 has 18,646,011 RDF documents from 21,171 domains. That is,
the FC09 dataset is doubled in the quantity of documents and the diversity of
domains as compared with FC08. The top-10 domains w.r.t. the number of RDF
documents are listed in Table 1.

From FC08, we identify 64,974,423 objects by using the heuristics described
in Section 2.2. Among all the objects identified, 63,795,076 ones (98.18%) are
identified by the HTTP URIs, and they are hosted by 621,619 domains. From
FC09, we identify 110,507,074 objects, and 108,842,826 ones (98.49%) are identified by the HTTP URIs hosted by 698,753 domains. That is, the number of

objects is also two times more than the one of last year, and the distribution of
these objects is more diverse. The top-10 domains w.r.t. the number of objects
are listed in Table 2.

From Table 1(b), we find that bio2rdf.org and dbpedia.org have most
RDF documents (41.22% and 19.91% respectively). Besides, most objects are
also distributed in these two domains (30.47% and 6.92%), see Table 2(b). So,
we export all RDF documents in bio2rdf.org and dbpedia.org to form two
domain-specific datasets, namely Bio2RDF(FC09) and DBpedia(FC09).

In Bio2RDF(FC09), we identify 36,036,254 objects derived from 7,685,644
documents. These objects are distributed in 1,720 domains. Besides, from
3,712,453 documents in DBpedia(FC09), we identify 17,414,639 objects, which
are distributed in 505,132 domains. In a sense, this indicates that DBpedia is a
linking-hub for interconnecting objects from various data sources.

3.3 Experimental Methodology

Three experiments are designed to explore object link structures in the Semantic
Web.

Firstly, to understand the macroscopic characteristics of the object link structure in the current Semantic Web, we analyze the object link graph in FC09. We
compute the average degree of this graph, which reflects the density of graph
in some sense. Then, we analyze the distribution of isolated vertices and investigate reasons why there are so many isolated vertices. Degree distribution of
the graph is depicted to reveal whether the graph has the scale-free natural.
Connected components of the graph are computed to reveal whether objects in
the Semantic Web are well interlinked. Effective diameter is approximately calculated to seek to understand within how many certain numbers of hops that
most connected object pairs can be interlinked.

Secondly, in order to confirm our findings and to find the evolution of OLGs
structure, we repeat the complex network analysis on FC08. We compare the
network characteristics of two objects link graphs.

In the third experiment, we analyze two domain-specific OLGs constructed
from Bio2RDF(FC09) and DBpedia(FC09) in the same way, and compare the
experimental results with the OLG in FC09.

4 Object Link Graph in the Current Semantic Web

In this section, we analysis the degree and connectivity of the OLG from FC09.

4.1 Degree

This OLG contains 110,507,074 vertices and 190,201,590 edges, the average degree of the graph is 3.44, and the highest degree is 1,181,411. Broder, et al. [6]
report that the web graph constructed from the traditional hypertext Web takes
an average in(out)-degree of 7.86, which means its degree as an undirected graph
maybe nearly doubled. Compared to the traditional hypertext Web, the small
average degree of the OLG indicates a sparse link structure.

By inspecting the degree of each vertex, we find that 4,746,095 (4.29%) objects
have no links to others. That is, objects do not link to other objects through a
sequence of triples connected by blank nodes (see Section 2.3 for details about
constructions of OLG). Most of these isolated objects are distributed in 10 do-
mains, as listed in Table 3. In particularly, the bio2rdf.org domain takes 43.6%
of all isolated objects found so far. After a close investigation on the RDF documents that mention these isolated objects, we find some typical patterns causing
the isolation: a) Objects are not connected to any other objects, but might be
connected to classes or properties, e.g. in their type declarations; b) Objects
are not connected to any other objects, but connected to literals, e.g. with only
literal description about these objects; and c) Objects are connected with blank
nodes.

Degree

Fig. 3. Degree distribution of the OLG
from FC09

The degree distribution is illustrated in Fig. 3. This distribution follows a
power law, indicating the scale-free nature of the graph. The power law exponent
of degree distributions of the OLG is 2.84, here we use a maximum-likelihood
method to fit the exponent [7]. Since the vast majority of vertices in the scale-free
network are with small degree, the graph is fault tolerant in the face of random
failures; But if a few major high degree vertices (hubs) are removed, it may turn
into a set of rather isolated graphs. Besides, anther important characteristic of
scale-free network is the clustering coefficient distribution, which decreases as
the vertex degree increase. That is, the low-degree vertices belong to very dense
sub-graphs and in the meantime hubs connect these sub-graphs together. Since
hubs connect sub-graphs each other and the number of hubs is few, we can feed
them as seeds in the search engine as a good placement. In-degree and outdegree distributions of subsets of the the traditional Web follow power law with
exponents 2.1 and 2.38-2.72, respectively [3,18,6]. OLGs power law exponent is
a little larger than ones of the traditional Web.

4.2 Connectivity

Connected Component. Connected component analysis on the OLG shows
that the largest CC has 97,391,271 (88.13%) objects. That is, 88.13% of objects
in FC09 are reachable to each other by following RDF links. This value is close
to the one of the traditional Web (91%) reported in [6], so the connectivity of
the OLG is not bad. Except the largest CC and the trivial ones (with only one
vertex), there are also 813,975 connected components. Objects in these connected
components mainly come from only one single domain (62.12%), and objects in
the most one only come from 1,000 domains.

Effective Diameter. Computing the diameter of a large graph is very costly. In
the case of the OLG, we cannot compute the exact diameter, instead, we apply
the Approximate Neighborhood Function (ANF) approach [20] to estimate the
?

?

?
effective diameter for the OLG.5 The approximate effective diameter of the OLG
is 11.53, which is a small one compared to the scale of the graph. Broder, et al. [6]
find that the average path length in the traditional Web (when a path exists) is
around 6.83 if all edges are considered to be undirected, which is much less than
the effective diameter of our OLG. That is, there is an average longer length of
the shortest path between connected objects than that of the traditional Web..

5 Structural Evolution of Object Link Graph

As mentioned above, in Section 3.2, the amounts of RDF documents and objects
in Falcons Crawl get doubled in the past year. So, we are naturally concern about
the structural change brought by the increasing RDF data. In this section, we
analyze the object link graph constructed from FC08, and compare it with the
OLG from FC09.

Degree

Fig. 4. Degree distribution of the
OLG from FC08

5.1 Degree

From 11,286,186 RDF documents in FC08, we identify 64,974,423 objects and
construct an object link graph with 64,974,423 vertices and 109,373,275 edges.
The average degree of the OLG is 3.37, which is a little smaller than the one
(3.44) of OLG from FC09. The slightly increasing average degree indicates that
the object link graph become less sparser during the past year.

We find that 3,987,843 (6.14%) isolated vertices are distributed in 16,353
domains. Table 4 lists the top-10 domains containing most isolated objects. Be-
sides, comparing with isolated vertices of the OLG from FC09, we find that some
isolated vertices in FC08 disappear in FC09, while some new isolated vertices
emerge in FC09. The percentage of isolated vertices declines in the past year
(from 6.14% to 4.29%), which shows a trend that objects are getting interlinked.

5 In our experiment, k is set to 32, which ensures that ANF achieves less than 10%

errors.

W. Ge et al.

The degree distribution of the OLG from FC08 is depicted in Fig. 4, which
also follows a power law, with the power law exponent 2.74. This exponent is
similar to the one of the OLG from FC09 (2.84).

5.2 Connectivity

Connected Component. Connected component analysis on the OLG in FC08
shows that the largest connected component takes 57,122,054 (87.91%) objects
and 104,675,519 (95.70%) edges. Except the largest connected component and
the trivial ones, there are also 686,071 connected components. Objects in these
connected components mainly come from only one single domain (46.72%), and
objects in the most one also come from 1,000 domains (the same as FC09).

The proportion of the size of the largest connected component in the object
link graph is a little increasing during the last year (from 87.91% to 88.13%),
which indicates that the trend of connectivity is to be better slightly.

Effective Diameter. The approximate effective diameter of the OLG from
FC08 is 12.28, which is larger than the one from FC09 (11.53). As this index is a
highly-accurate approximation, it is likely that the diameter of the OLG shrinks
in the past year.

6 Domain-Specific Object Link Structures in the

Semantic Web

To verify whether the scale-free nature and small effective diameter also hold
for some domain-specific OLGs, and to find the reason why OLG has a sparse
structure compared to the traditional Web, we analyze two OLGs constructed
from the two largest data sources in FC09, namely Bio2RDF(FC09) and DBpe-
dia(FC09). That is, we construct each OLG from a set of dereference documents
from some certain domain (bio2rdf.org or dbpedia.org). Here, the two OLGs
are called the Bio2RDF OLG and the DBpedia OLG respectively.

6.1 Degree

The average degrees of the Bio2RDF OLG and the DBpedia OLG are 3.56
and 3.49 respectively, which indicate a low density in object links in both
Bio2RDF(FC09) and DBpedia(FC09). As the homepage of DBpedia6 points out,
DBpedia contains 807,000 links to images and 3,840,000 links to external web
pages; 4,878,100 external links into other RDF datasets. In fact, DBpedia functions as a linking-hub for interconnecting various data sources to form the main
part of the current Data Web. So its divergent structure results in a low density.
As Bio2RDF [4] tries to make documents from public bioinformatics databases,
such as Kegg, PDB, MGI, HGNC and several of NCBIs databases, available in

figured out in the middle-lower part of the Linking Open Data graph.7 So it is
likely the reason that the Bio2RDF OLG has a low density.

Because Bio2rdf(FC09) and DBpedia(FC09) contain 61.13% RDF documents
of the total in FC09, it is reasonable to believe that the low density of both
Bio2rdf(FC09) and DBpedia(FC09) has great influence on the low density of
the object links in FC09.

The number of isolated vertices in the Bio2rdf OLG and the DBpedia OLG
are 2,073,663 (5.75%) and 7,193 (0.04%) respectively. Degree distributions of
these two OLGs are depicted in Fig. 5. Both two distributions approximately
follow power law with exponent 2.52 and 2.59 respectively.

6.2 Connectivity

Connected Component. The largest connected component of the Bio2rdf
OLG takes 32,354,360 (89.78%) objects, and the one of DBpedia is 16,499,512
(94.75%). We notice that largest connected components of these two OLGs are
both contained in the largest connected component of OLG from FC09, which
indicates most objects in these two datasets are interlinked. Besides, both OLGs
have a better connectivity than the OLG from FC09 (88.13%).

Effective Diameter. The approximate effective diameters of the Bio2rdf OLG
and the DBpedia OLG are 7.38 and 7.81 respectively. Both of them are small as
compared to the scale of the graph.

Graph analysis has been extensively performed on page link graph to the hypertext Web. Albert, et al. [3] analyzed the distributions of incoming and outgoing

links between HTML documents in the World Wide Web, and observed power
law tails. Adamic [1] showed that the largest strongly connected component of
the graph of sites in the Web is a small world. He also counted how many links
the sites received from other sites, and found that the distribution of links also
follows a power law [2]. Broder, et al. [6] confirmed power law distributions of
in- and out-degree. They studied the directed and undirected connected components of the Web, and showed that power laws also arise in the distribution
of sizes of those connected components. They revealed that the true structure
of the web graph must be somewhat subtler than a small world phenomenon
in which a browser can pass from any web page to any other with a few clicks.
Further, they figured out a bow-tie structure as the macroscopic structure of the
Web. Even recently, researcher were still studying various datasets to investigate topological properties of the Web graph, such as bipartite cores, PageRank
values, and some correlations [12].

Graph analysis techniques have also been applied to single ontologies or a
set of ontologies. Hoser, et al. [16] illustrated the benefits of applying social
network analysis to ontologies by measuring SWRC and SUMO ontologies. They
interpreted an ontology as a graph: classes and properties became vertices in the
graph; an arc was added from a class to its superclass, or from a property to
its domain, range, and superproperty. They discussed how different notions of
centrality (degree, betweenness, eigenvector, etc.) describe the core content and
structure of an ontology, and compared ontologies in size, scope, etc. Zhang [24]
studied NCI-Ontology, Full-Galen, and other five ontologies, and discovered that
the degree distributions of these entity networks fit power laws well. Theoharis,
et al. [21] analyzed graph features of 250 ontologies. For each ontology, they
constructed a property graph and a class subsumption graph. The property
graph is a directed graph whose vertices correspond to classes and literal types,
and whose arcs point from the domain of a property to its range. They found that
the majority of ontologies with a significant number of properties approximate a
power law for total-degree distribution, and each ontology has a few focal classes
that have numerous properties and subclasses. Gil, et al. [13] combined ontologies
from the DAML Ontology Library into a single RDF graph, which included
56,592 vertices and 131,130 arcs. They observed that the graph is a small world
with an average path length 4.37, and the cumulative degree distribution follows
a power law with exponent  = 1.485. Recently, Cheng and Qu [9] studied the
graph structures of dependence between concepts and between vocabularies. The
graphs analyzed in the experiments are constructed from a large dataset that
contains more than 1 million terms in more than 3 thousand vocabularies. The
results characterize the current status of schemas in the Semantic Web in many
aspects, including degree distributions, reachability, and connectivity.

The Semantic Web has also been analyzed from other aspects. Hausenblas, et
al. [14] attempted to answering the question: What is the size of the Semantic
Web? through analyzing the Linking Open Data dataset. Wang, et al. [23] surveyed nearly 1,300 ontologies and analyzed their expressiveness, the use of OWL
constructs, the shape of class hierarchy, etc. Tummarello, et al. [22] found that

the distribution (reuse) of URIs over documents follows a power law. Ding and
Finin [10] collected 1,448,504 RDF documents and focused on the distribution
of documents over hosts and the sizes of documents. They measured the complexity of terms by counting the number of RDF triples used to define them,
and measured the instance space by counting the meta-usages of terms. Power
laws were observed in both experiments. Ding, et al. [11] collected over 1.5 million of FOAF documents, and analyzed the empirical usage of namespace and
properties in the FOAF community. The authors selected about 7,000 FOAF
documents containing 50,559 instances of foaf:Person, and analyzed the social
networks induced by those FOAF documents and revealed some interesting pat-
terns. To the best of our knowledge, the macrostructure of the instance level of
the Semantic Web has not yet been well studied.

8 Conclusion

In summary, the main contributions of this paper are as follows.

1. A notion of object link graph is proposed to model the Semantic Web structure at the instance level. Based on this notion, we construct an object link
graph from a large dataset, namely FC09. We show that the object link
graph has the scale-free nature and the effective diameter of the graph is
11.53, which is a small one compared to the scale of the graph.

2. We repeat the complex network analysis on another dataset, namely FC08.
The results confirm that the object link graph is scale-free and its effective
diameter is a small one compared to the graphs scale. Comparing the object
link structure of FC09 with the one of FC08, we observe that the object link
graph is not becoming sparser and its diameter is likely to shrink in the past
year, though the amounts of documents and objects both doubled, which
indicates a good evolution of the Data Web.

3. We repeat the complex network analysis on the two largest domain-specific
subsets of FC09, namely Bio2RDF(FC09) and DBpedia(FC09). The results
show that both Bio2RDF(FC09) and DBpedia(FC09) have low density in
object links, which has great influence on the density of OLG from FC09.

The resulting characteristics of these graphs are summarized in Table 5. The
dataset, analyzed graphs, and statistical results are available online.8 These

experimental results presented in this paper can indicate the current state of
the object link structure in the Semantic Web.

From these results, we obtain some observations. Firstly, the object link graph
inherits some characteristics of the hypertext link structure, such as the scalefree nature. Secondly, a low average degree makes the object link graph different
from the page link graph. In fact, a low average degree indicates the lack of links
between objects in the Semantic Web, making the object link graph be more
sparse, compared with the page link graph. We believe that publishing more
object links online will make the Semantic Web better. Besides, more effort is
needed to investigate the URI alias phenomena [17] and study the impact of the
URI alias phenomenon on the object link structure.

Hopefully, the macroscopic properties of object link structure provided by
this paper can help people better understand the current Web of data. In future
work, more experiments are deserved to detail the big picture of the object link
graph in the Semantic Web, and the dynamic model of the object link graph
in the Semantic Web needs to be investigated. Besides, the interaction behavior
between instance level and schema level in the Semantic Web is an interesting
topic to be studied.
