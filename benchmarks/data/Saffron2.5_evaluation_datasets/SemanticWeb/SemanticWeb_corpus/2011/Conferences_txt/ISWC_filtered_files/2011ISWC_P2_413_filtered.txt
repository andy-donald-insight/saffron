10 Years of Semantic Web Research:

Searching for Universal Patterns

Abstract. At 10 years of age, there is little doubt that the Semantic
Web is an engineering success, with substantial (and growing) take-up
in business, government and media. However, as a scientific field, have
we discovered any general principles? Have we uncovered any universal
patterns that give us insights into the structure of data, information
and knowledge, patterns that are valid beyond the engineering of the
Semantic Web in its current form?

If we would build the Semantic Web again, surely some things would
end up looking different, but are there things that would end up looking
the same, simply because they have to be that way?
