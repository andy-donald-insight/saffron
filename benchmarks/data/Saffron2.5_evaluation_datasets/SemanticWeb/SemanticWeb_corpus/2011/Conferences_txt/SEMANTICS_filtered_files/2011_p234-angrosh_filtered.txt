ABSTRACT
This paper reports our research  work  carried out for developing 
intelligent information systems using citation context information 
extracted from research articles. We explain in this paper the steps 
followed for identifying, extracting and managing contextual data 
from articles published in ESWC series. Reporting on the amount 
of  triplification data  produced  in  the  process,  we  describe  our 
application developed for  providing  value  added  information 
services for the research community.

1. BACKGROUND
Research  articles  have  emerged  as  an  important  medium  of 
research  communication.  However,  in  recent  times,  a drastic 
increase  in  the  research  output  has  drawn  significant  research 
attention focused  on  developing  intelligent  information  systems
using  the  content. One  of the prominent  research  questions  has 
been  to  look  into  the  task  of  extracting  contextual  information 
from the research content and employ these contexts for providing 
value  added  information  services.  However,  the  unstructured 
format of research content poses serious challenges in achieving 
this objective. Against this backdrop, the present research is taken 
up for developing intelligent information systems, exploiting the 
research  content. After  achieving  good  results  with  our  initial 
work on ontologically modelling contexts of sentences in related 
work sections of research articles [1], we explored the possibility 
of identifying contexts of sentences across the entire article. This 
paper explains  our  research  work  carried  out  for  extracting 
contextual data from articles published in the European Semantic 
Web  Conference  (ESWC)  series. We  report  on the  triplification 
data resulting from our research work and also describe the linked 
data application developed for using the derived contextual data.

2. WHAT WERE THE CONTEXT TYPES
DEFINED IN THE STUDY?
We  considered  only  those  paragraphs  containing citations  and 
classified sentences in each paragraph into citation sentences and 
non-citation sentences. We defined a classification scheme of ten
context types  for  citation  sentences  and  seven context types  for 
non-citation sentences. The context types are shown in Figure 1. 
These were  defined  after  manually  analyzing  331  citation 
sentences and  838  non-citation  sentences  respectively  from  our 
training dataset of 20 articles selected from the Lecture Notes in 
Computer  Science  (LNCS)  collection  at  springerlink.com.  We 
proposed  a framework  based  on  a generic  rhetorical  pattern 
observed in paragraphs of the training dataset as shown in Figure 
1. The contexts served as our labels for sentences that were used 
in  machine  learning  experiments  and  also  provided  a  basis  for 
developing  the  Sentence  Context  Ontology. More  details  about 
the context types and the framework are presented by Angrosh et 
al. [2].

3. HOW DID WE MODEL THE 
CONTEXTUAL INFORMATION?
In  order  to  model  the  different  contexts identified  above with 
suitable  relations,  we  developed  the  Sentence  Context  Ontology
which facilitated in deriving RDF data. The ontology is available

4. HOW DID WE ACHIEVE AUTOMATIC 
CONTEXT IDENTIFICATION?
We carried out supervised learning experiments using Maximum 
Entropy Markov Models (MEMMs) [3] and Conditional Random 
Fields (CRFs) [4] for achieving automatic context identification. 
We  defined  various  features  and  tested  their  ability  to  predict 
sentence context labels using our training dataset.  The results of 
our  experiments  are  tabulated  in  Table  1.  More  details  of  the 
machine learning experiments are presented by Angrosh et al. [2].

5. HOW DID WE EXTRACT 
INFORMATION FROM ARTICLES?
Various  modules  were  developed in  Python  for
identifying, 
extracting and managing information from research articles. The 
architecture of the system is shown in Figure 3.

6. HOW MUCH DATA HAVE WE 
GENERATED?
Employing 
techniques  described  above, we  extracted 
information  from  research  articles  published  in  the  European 
Semantic Web Conference (ESWC). Table 2 provides the details 
of  the  extracted  data  from  the  ESWC  series.  As  seen  from  the 
table,  presently,  we  have  extracted  data  from  seven  volumes 
published  in  the  ESWC  series.  This  provided  a  total  of  355
articles(cid:107). Paragraphs with citation sentences were extracted from 
these articles and a total of 10,564 sentences were extracted from 
these paragraphs. This included a total of 6,158 citation sentences 
and 4,406 non-citation sentences respectively. Further, a total of 
17,844 authors  were  extracted  from  cited  works (citations)  in 
these articles and a total number of 4,121 documents were cited 
by these articles.

(cid:107) A few articles published in these seven volumes were not considered for 
different  reasons.  Some  were  invited  talks, while  some  followed  a 
different reference format.

The  extracted  data  were stored  in  relation  form  and  were 
converted to RDF data using the D2R Server. The mapping file of 
the  D2R  Server  was  configured  as  per  the  Sentence  Context 
Ontology. This resulted in about 250,000 triples. 
7. WHAT APPLICATION IS DEVELOPED 
USING TRIPLIFICATION DATA?
Currently, we have developed a linked data application using the 
triplification data for providing value added information services 
for  the  research  community. The  application  is  available  at 
https://info-nts-12.otago.ac.nz:8090/cirrademo/. It uses  SPARQL 
to query RDF data and Exhibit Timeline for providing interactive 
user interfaces. The following sections briefly explain the features
and different timelines provided by the application.
7.1 Use of Data from a SPARQL Endpoint
The application uses DBLP linked data available at the SPARQL 
endpoint  (cid:177) http://rkbexplorer.com for  retrieving  metadata  of 
articles in ESWC using keywords extracted from these titles.

7.2 Citation Sentences Timeline
The application supports viewing all citation sentences along with 
their  contexts  on  a  timeline.  The  timeline  is  an  interactive 
interface  that  enables  horizontal  scrolling  of  information  placed 
on  the  timeline.  The  citation  sentences  of  an  article  are  placed 
according to the year of the cited work and are distinguished by 
the use of different colours, with each colour signifying a different 

context type. Users can select citation sentences of a specific type. 
For example, if an user is interested in viewing only those citation 
sentences that identify shortcomings in the cited work, he/she can 
accordingly choose that context type  to view only those citation
sentences. Clicking on one of these citation sentences, results in 
the display of associated sentences in a lens view. These include 
(a) preceding issue sentence; (b) preceding shortcoming sentence; 
(c)  following description sentence; (d) following issue sentence; 
(e)  following  shortcoming  sentence;  (f)  preceding  citation 
sentence  and  (g)  following  citation  sentence.  The  Sentence 
Context Ontology is used to model this information. Furthermore,
each citation sentence displays cited work, which the user can use 
to navigate to the citations timeline to learn more about the cited 
work.  The  timeline  also  facilitates  navigation  to  the  author 
(cid:182)
7.3 Author Timeline
The  author  timeline  displays  all  works  of  an  author  by 
distinguishing  between  citing  and  cited  works  along  with  the 
contexts.
7.4 Citations Timeline
The  citations  timeline  displays  the  contexts  in  which  a  specific 
cited work is used by various authors in different articles on the 
timeline. This forms an important tool for the research community 
as  it  helps  in  better  understanding  of  the  cited  work  by  easily 
viewing different contexts in which the cited work was used.
7.5 Keywords Timeline
The  keywords  timeline  allows  for  searching  citation  sentences 
using keywords. The application extracts keywords from citation 
sentences and creates an index for this purpose. This facilitates in 
sketching the intellectual lineage for ideas by understanding how 
different people have cited different works for specific keywords.
7.6 Export Data in Different Formats
The application allows for exporting data in different formats such 
as RDF/XML, Semantic wikitext, Exhibit JSON and tab separated 
values.
