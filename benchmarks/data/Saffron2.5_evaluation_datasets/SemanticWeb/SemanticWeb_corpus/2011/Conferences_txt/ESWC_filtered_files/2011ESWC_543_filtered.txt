Abstract. A growing amount of structured data is published on the
Web and complements the textual content. Searching the textual content is performed primarily by the means of keyword queries and Information Retrieval methods. Structured data allow database-like queries
for retrieval. Since structured and unstructured data occur often as a
combination of both, are embedded in each other, or are complementary,
the question of how search can take advantage of this hybrid data setting arises. Of particular interest is the question of how ranking as the
algorithmic decision of what information is relevant for a given query can
take structured and unstructured data into account by also allowing hybrid queries consisting of structured elements combined with keywords.
I propose to investigate this question in the course of my PhD thesis.

1 Introduction

Currently, an increasing amount of structured data is published on the Web
according to the Linked Data principles. This structured data supplements the
textual, unstructured data already available on the Web and thereby provides
the basis for new ways of searching the Web. The structured data is available in
several ways. On the one hand there are data sets available as purely structured
RDF independent from a text base, and on the other hand there is structured
data embedded directly in textual data via RDFa or data extracted from texts.
Taking advantage of this heterogenous environment promises to improve search
by making it possible to answer more kinds of information needs, because some
information needs benefit greatly from structured data, e.g. What is the population of Berlin?. Here, the answer is a fact assertion, whereas other information
needs are better addressed with textual documents, e.g. Why did Heinrich von
Kleist commit suicide?, where a potential answers might be his suicide note, if
at all, but certainly not a fact assertion. Moreover, texts can hold sentiments,
preferences and opinions, which are often supported by facts and data. There-
fore, a hybrid data scenario holds also the possibility to examine the retrieval of
opinions or different views on a topic and the facts supporting them. Thus far,
document and fact retrieval are often regarded as two separate disciplines and

the combination of both for search is not yet investigated in a satisfying way[1].
This thesis is situated between these two disciplines and combines them on the
data and on the query level. We call this scenario Hybrid Search. However, search
comprises the entire technical spectrum from indexing to the user interface. This
thesis concentrates on ranking, which is a core method of search and crucial for
its effectiveness. The goal of this thesis is to investigate a unified ranking framework for hybrid search as the search on structured and unstructured data with
queries consisting of keywords and structured elements. The question this thesis addresses is how structured and unstructured data can be used to improve
search and how hybrid queries can be answered on hybrid data.

2 Problem Definition

This thesis addresses the problem of ranking on hybrid data for hybrid queries.
The frame of this research problem is defined by the following data and query
model: The proposed data model follows the RDF data model with Named
Graphs1 and is represented as a graph G(R, L, ER, EL, EG, G) consisting of resource nodes R, edges ER connecting resource nodes, edges EL connecting resource nodes to literal nodes L, and edges EG connecting resource nodes to

Named Graphs G, which are graphs G(R
L) consisting of subsets of
  R. Textual data is integrated following the same
the elements of G, e.g. R
modeling paradigm and using the already mentioned modeling constructs. Each
text entity is represented by a resource of the type textual document. This resource has one edge, labelled content, pointing to a literal node holding the
textual information. In a later stage, there can be more edges providing more
fine grated distinctions, such as headline, paragraph, etc. All triples comprised
by the textual information of one textual entity form a Named Graph g  G, as
illustrated in Figure 1 by the dashed circle. The data model is a simplified RDF
model with Named Graphs and allows to use RDF data easily.

Queries to this data model should have a seamless flexibility ranging from
purely textual keyword queries, over hybrid queries, to crisp structured queries.
A hybrid query q can consist of a structured part qs and a textual part qt, i.e.
q = qs  qt. If one part is empty, the query is either purely textual or purely

structured. The structured part qs follows the SPARQL query language and is a
set of graph patterns, qs = {qs1, qs2, ...}. The textual part qt allows to associate
a keyword query kw to each variable, i.e. qt = {qti
|qti = (xi, kw), xi  V ar(q)}.
For example, assume the information need: Formula One drivers who moved to
Switzerland 2, which is illustrated in Figure 2. The result to such a query are
bindings to the distinguished variables. This model allows to represent purely
structured, hybrid, and purely textual queries. A purely textual query, i.e. simple
keyword query, would be the query in Fig. 2 without line (1). This query model
is a close adaptation of the model by [3].

3 State of the Art

Related fields of research are IR, in particular Web IR, ranking of structured
data and databases, and the already existing work on hybrid. This section briefly
outlines related work of these fields to the proposed approach in the Section 4.
Ranking originated in the IR community, where the retrieval units are textual documents. The main notions for ranking are descriptive statistics about
the documents and the entire document corpus, such as term frequency. One of
the most used algorithm in this line is BM25[4]. Language model approaches are
increasingly applied, because of their formal basis in probability theory. There-
fore, language models will be the basis for the proposed ranking approach. The
work by [5] are of particular interest, since it builds on language models for
structured retrieval, combines keywords and structured queries and addresses
structural mismatches between query and data structure. However, structure
means here the document and sentence structure and not a graph based data
model. Ranking for Web search deals not just with fixed document corpora, but
with the entire scale of the Web. However, it can take advantage of the link
structure of the Web. Exemplars using this link analysis are foremost the well
known works by [6] and [7]. Translating the idea of [6,7] for ranking data on
the Web has been studied by [8,9]. Also concepts of XML retrieval [10] as the
retrieval of semi-structured documents needs to be addressed. The parallels are
here that elements in the XML scenario are similar to resources in ours. Ranking
for databases draws on the advantage that the data schema is strict and rigid,
which is not the case in our setting. Still, the idea of correlations[11] between
values needs to be investigated. Combing text and structured data, i.e. hybrid
approaches, such as [12], which uses a domain ontology for retrieving documents,
or [13], which retrieves documents as well as factual assertions. However, the data
setting is different to ours. Most notably is the approach by [3], which could be

used as a reference in an evaluation, because it supports keyword augmented
structured queries similar to ours. However, the approach does not take documents into account, and is centered around triples as the atomic units, where as
our proposed approach regards entities, i.e. URIs of subjects respectively objects,
as the atomic pieces.

4 Proposed Approach

Starting point are retrieval methods similar to [3,5] applied to a hybrid scenario,
because they have proven to be applicable for similar settings and are the state of
the art in IR. Following the idea of language models, we rank result graphs according to the probability of being an result graph g to the given query q, i.e. P (g|q). The
structured part of the query is regarded as a constraint for the beginning and can
be relaxed later. It fulfills the purpose of selecting candidate results. Since qs determines the shape of the result graphs, all possible graphs share the same structure.
Therefore, the rank of a result depends only on the aspects, which differentiate the
results, i.e. the bindings to the variables and their relations to qt. Therefore, we can

the keyword and triple patterns associated to variables xi.

P (qi|xi)

P (qi|xi) is computed in two ways depending whether q is a purely structured
query or not. If it is purely structured, the query is crisp and we assume that
the information need is entirely captured. The ranking is then based on the
popularity of the resulting URIs. If a textual part is present, the information
need is rather imprecisely captured making it necessary to rank the results by
measuring the relation of each keyword k of the textual part to the corresponding
variable, see equation (2).

If a textual part is present, several models for computing Pt(k|xi) will be inves-
tigated: Starting with a simple one, which takes all textual information of xi as one
bag-of-words and a more fine grained one, which takes the edges from xi to neighboring nodes into account.This ranking model is an initial model for the study of
search in the hybrid scenario. Possible future directions of research are to extend
this model and integrate more of the semantics provided by the underlying data.

5 Evaluation Methodology

The widest acceptance in IR for evaluating ranking approaches has the so-called
Cranfield methodology[14]. It provides well studied grounds and will be the basis
of the evaluation in line with [15]. However, the setting needs to be adapted to the
hybrid scenario. This can be done by adding structured elements to the keyword

queries of [15] and by using datasets, which are a combination of structured and
unstructured data, e.g. the combination of Wikipedia and dbpedia.

6 Conclusion

The goal of this thesis is to investigate a unified ranking methodology for search
on hybrid data using adaptive queries. The proposed approach builds on a graph
based data model, which is compatible to RDF and incorporates textual docu-
ments. The query model allows seamless querying ranging from purely textual
queries, to hybrid queries, and to purely structured queries. The ranking approach builds methodologically on language models. The evaluation methodology uses existing standards from the IR community, if applicable, but needs to
be adapted to the hybrid context. The question this thesis addresses is how the
combination of structured and unstructured data can be used to improve search.
