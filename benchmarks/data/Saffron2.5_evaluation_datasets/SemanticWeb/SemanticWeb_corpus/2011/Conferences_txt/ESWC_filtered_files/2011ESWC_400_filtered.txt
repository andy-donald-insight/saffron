Abstract. As the most popular microblogging platform, the vast
amount of content on Twitter is constantly growing so that the retrieval
of relevant information (streams) is becoming more and more difficult every day. Representing the semantics of individual Twitter activities and
modeling the interests of Twitter users would allow for personalization
and therewith countervail the information overload. Given the variety
and recency of topics people discuss on Twitter, semantic user profiles
generated from Twitter posts moreover promise to be beneficial for other
applications on the Social Web as well. However, automatically inferring
the semantic meaning of Twitter posts is a non-trivial problem.

In this paper we investigate semantic user modeling based on Twitter posts. We introduce and analyze methods for linking Twitter posts
with related news articles in order to contextualize Twitter activities. We
then propose and compare strategies that exploit the semantics extracted
from both tweets and related news articles to represent individual Twitter activities in a semantically meaningful way. A large-scale evaluation
validates the benefits of our approach and shows that our methods relate tweets to news articles with high precision and coverage, enrich the
semantics of tweets clearly and have strong impact on the construction
of semantic user profiles for the Social Web.

Keywords: semantic enrichment, twitter, user profile construction,
news, linkage.

1 Introduction and Motivation

With the advent of social networking, tagging or microblogging that become tangible in Social Web systems like Facebook, Delicious and Twitter, a new culture
of participation penetrates the Web. Today, more than 190 million people are
using Twitter and together publish more than 65 million messages (tweets) per
day1. Recent research shows that the exploitation of tweets allows for valuable
applications such as earthquake warning systems [1], opinion mining [2] or discovery and ranking of fresh Web sites [3]. These applications mainly analyze and
utilize the wisdom of the crowds as source of information rather than relying on
individual tweets. Analogously, previous research in the field of microblogging

studied information propagation patterns in the global Twitter network [4,5]
and exploited network structures to identify influentual users [6,7] as well as
malicious users [8,9]. While related work reveals several insights regarding the
characteristics of the global Twitter network, there exists little research on understanding the semantics of individual microblogging activities and modeling
individual users on Twitter with Semantic Web technologies.

Learning and modeling the semantics of individual Twitter activities is important because the amount of tweets published each day is continuously growing
so that users need support to benefit from Twitter information streams. For ex-
ample, given the huge amount of information streams available on Twitter, user
profiling and personalization techniques that support users in selecting streams
to follow or particular items to read are becoming crucial [6]. Further, given the
variety and recency of topics people discuss on Twitter [5], user profiles that
capture the semantics of individual tweets are becoming interesting for other
applications on the Social Web as well. In order to provide personalization functionalities in Twitter and moreover enable Social Web applications to consume
semantically meaningful representations of the users Twitter activities, there is
thus urgent need to research user modeling strategies that allow for the construction of user profiles with rich semantics.

In this paper we introduce approaches for enriching the semantics of Twitter posts and modeling users based on their microblogging activities. Given the
realtime nature and news media characteristics of Twitter [5], we explore possibilities of linking Twitter posts with news articles from the Web. Therefore,
we present and evaluate different strategies that link tweets with news articles
and contextualize the semantics of tweets with semantics extracted from the
corresponding news articles. Based on a large dataset of more than 3 million
tweets published by more than 45,000 users, we compare the performance of different strategies for linking tweets with news and analyze their impact on user
modeling.

2 Related Work

Since Twitter was launched in 2007 research started to investigate the phenomenon of microblogging. Most research on Twitter investigates the network
structure and properties of the Twitter network, e.g. [4,5,6,7]. Kwak et al. conducted a temporal analysis of trending topics in Twitter and discovered that
over 85% of the tweets posted everyday are related to news [5]. They also show
that hashtags are good indicators to detect events and trending topics. Huang
et al. analyze the semantics of hashtags in more detail and reveal that tagging
in Twitter rather used to join public discussions than organizing content for future retrieval [10]. Laniada and Mika [11] have defined metrics to characterize
hashtags with respect to four dimensions: frequency, specificity, consistency, and
stability over time. The combination of measures can help assessing hashtags as
strong representative identifiers. Miles explored the retrieval of hashtags for recommendation purposes and introduced a method which considers user interests
?

?

?
in a certain topic to find hashtags that are often applied to posts related to this
topic [12]. In this paper, we compare hashtag-based methods with methods that
extract and analyze the semantics of tweets. While SMOB [13], the semantic microblogging framework, enables users to explicitly attach semantic annotations
(URIs) to their short messages by applying MOAT [14] and therewith allows for
making the meaning of (hash)tags explicit, our ambition is to infer the semantics
of individual Twitter activities automatically.

Research on information retrieval and personalization in Twitter focussed on
ranking users and content. For example, Cha et al. [7] present an in-depth comparison of three measures of influence, in-degree, re-tweets, and mentions, to
identify and rank influential users. Based on these measures, they also investigate the dynamics of user influence across topics and time. Weng et al. [6] focus
on identifying influential users of microblogging services as well. They reveal
that the presence of reciprocity can be explained by phenomenon of homophily,
i.e. people who are similar are likely to follow each other. Content recommendations in Twitter aim at evaluating the importance of information for a given
user and directing the users attention to certain items. Anlei et al. [3] propose a
method to use microblogging streams to detect fresh URLs mentioned in Twitter messages and compute rankings of these URLs. Chen et al. also focus on
recommending URLs posted in Twitter messages and propose to structure the
problem of content recommendations into three separate dimensions [15]: discovering the source of content, modeling the interests of the users to rank content
and exploiting the social network structure to adjust the ranking according to
the general popularity of the items. Chen et al. however do not investigate user
modeling in detail, but represent users and their tweets by means of a bag of
words, from which they remove stop-words. In this paper we go beyond bag-
of-word representations and link tweets to news articles from which we extract
entities to generate semantically more meaningful user profiles.

Interweaving traditional news media and social media is the goal of research
projects such as SYNC32, which aims to enrich news events with opinions from
the blogosphere. Twitris 2.0 [16] is a Semantic Web platform that connects eventrelated Twitter messages with other media such as YouTube videos and Google
News. Using Twarql [17] for the detection of DBpedia entities and making the
semantics of hashtags explicit (via tagdef 3), it captures the semantics of major
news events. TwitterStand [18] also analyzes the Twitter network to capture
tweets that correspond to late breaking news. Such analyses on certain news
events, such as the election in Iran 2009 [2] or the earthquake in Chile 2010 [19],
have also been conducted by other related work. However, analyzing the feasibility of linking individual tweets with news articles for enriching and contextualizing the semantics of user activities on Twitter to generate valuable user
profiles for the Social Web  which is the main contribution of this paper  has
not been researched yet.

3 How to Exploit Twitter for Semantic User Modeling?

The length of Twitter messages is limited to 140 characters which makes it difficult to detect the semantics of these messages. For example, posts such as In-
teresting: http://bit.ly/iajV21 #politics or @nytimes this makes me scared
are even for humans difficult to understand without knowing the context. How-
ever, by following the links one can explore this context and grasp the semantics
of the tweets. Many Twitter activities are related to news events. According to
Kwak et al., more than 85% of the tweets in the Twitter network are related to
news [5]. This observation motivates our idea of linking Twitter activities with
news articles to automatically capture and enrich the semantics of microblogging
activities. Such relations between tweets and news further allow for capturing
user interests regarding trending topics and support applications that require
recent user interests like recommender systems for news or other fresh items.

Figure 1(a) visualizes the components of our approach for constructing user
profiles with rich semantics based on Twitter posts. We relate Twitter messages
with news articles and exploit the content of both tweets and news articles to
derive the semantics of the users microblogging activities. Therefore, we aggregate individual posts of Twitter users as well as news articles published by
mainstream media such as CNN, BBC, or New York Times and propose the
following components.
?

?

?
Linkage. The challenge of linking tweets and news articles is to identify these
articles a certain Twitter message refers to. Sometimes, users explicitly link
to the corresponding Web sites, but often there is no hyperlink within a
Twitter message which requires more advanced strategies. In Section 4 we
introduce and evaluate different strategies that allow for the discovery of
relations between tweets and news articles.

Semantic Enrichment. Given the content of tweets and news articles, another
challenge is to extract valuable semantics from the textual content. Further,
when processing news article Web sites an additional challenge is to extract
the main content of the news article. While RSS facilitates aggregation of
news articles, the main content of a news article is often not embedded
within the RSS feed, but is available via the corresponding HTML-formatted
Web site. These Web sites contain supplemental content (boilerplate) such
as navigation menus, advertisements or comments provided by readers of the
article. To extract the main content of news articles we use BoilerPipe [20],
a library that applies linguistic rules to separate main content from the
boilerplate.
In order to support user modeling and personalization it is important to 
given the raw content of tweets and news articles  distill topics and extract
entities users are concerned with. We therefore utilize Web services provided
by OpenCalais4, which allow for the extraction of entities such as people,
organizations or events and moreover assign unique URIs to known entities
and topics.
The connections between the semantically enriched news articles and Twitter
posts enable us to construct a rich RDF graph that represents the microblogging activities in a semantically well-defined context.

User Modeling. Based on the RDF graph, which connects Twitter posts, news
articles, related entities and topics, we introduce and analyze user modeling
strategies that create semantically rich user profiles describing different facets
of the users (see Section 5).

Figure 1(b) further illustrates our generic solution by means of an example
taken from our dataset: a user is posting a message about the election of the
sportsman of the year and states that she supports Francesca Schiavone, an
Italian tennis player. The Twitter message itself just mentions the given name
francesca and indicates with a hashtag (#sport) that this post is related to
sports. Hence, given just the text from this Twitter message it is not possible to automatically infer that the user is concerned with the tennis player.
Given our linkage strategies (see Section 4), one can relate the Twitter message with a corresponding news article published by CNN, which details on the
SI sportsman election and Francesca Schiavone in particular. Entity and topic
recognition reveal that the article is about tennis (topic:Tennis) and Schiavones
(person:Francesca Schiavone) success at French Open (event:FrenchOpen) and
therewith enrich the semantics which can be extracted from the Twitter message
itself (topic:Sports).

4 Analyzing Linkage between Tweets and News for

Semantic Enrichment

The key idea of our approach to enrich the semantics of Twitter messages is
based on relating individual tweets to news articles so that semantics extracted
from news articles can be applied to clarify the meaning of tweets. In this section
we introduce different strategies for linking Twitter posts with news articles that
provide details on these posts. To evaluate the impact of these strategies on the
semantic enrichment of Twitter posts we conduct an analysis on a large dataset
gathered from Twitter and major news publishing Web sites.

4.1 Strategies for Discovering Tweet-News Relations
The strategies, which we propose to find correlations between Twitter posts
and external news resources, can be divided into URL-based strategies, which
exploit interaction patterns and hyperlinks mentioned in tweets, and contentbased strategies, which exploit the content of tweets and news articles. In the
following definitions, T denotes the set of all tweets available in our dataset while
N refers to the set of news articles.

URL-based Strategies. URLs (mostly short URLs shortened by services such
as bit.ly) that are contained in tweets can be considered as indicators for newsrelated tweets. In particular, if a tweet contains a URL that points to an external
news resource, there is a very high possibility that this tweet is closely related to
the linked resource. Based on this principle we defined two URL-based strategies.
Definition 1 (Strict URL-based strategy). If a Twitter post t  T contains
at least one URL that is from certain mainstream news publishers and links to
a news article n  N, then we consider t and n as related: (t, n)  Rs, where
Rs  T  N.
For this strategy, we select BBC, CNN and the New York Times as the set
of mainstream news publishers and apply URL-patterns to discover the corresponding tweets that point to these Web sites. A potential drawback of the strict
URL-based strategy is that it will miss relevant relations for Twitter messages
that contains no URL. For example, if a user replies to Twitter message that
is according to the strict URL-based strategy related to a news article n then
this reply message might be related to n as well. Based on this idea, we define a
second URL-based strategy that is more flexible than the first one.
Definition 2 (Lenient URL-based strategy). If a tweet tr  T is a reply
or re-tweet from another tweet t  T , which contains at least one URL that is
linked to a news article n  N authored by certain mainstream news publishers,
then we consider both tr and t as being related to n: (tr, n)  Rl, (t, n)  Rl,
where Rl  T  N.
Hence, the lenient URL-based strategy extends the strict strategy with tweets
that were published as part of an interaction with a tweet that is according to
the strict strategy news-related so that Rs  Rl.
?

?

?
Content based Strategies. As tweets do not necessarily contain a URL, we
propse another set of strategies that exploit the content of tweets and news articles to connect tweets with news. For example, the Twitter post about Francesca
Schiavone in Figure 1(b) should be linked to the corresponding news article even
though the tweet does not have a URL directly pointing to the article. We thus
propose three further strategies that analyze the content of Twitter posts to
allow for linkage between Twitter activities and news articles.
Definition 3 (Bag-of-Words Strategy). Formally, a Twitter post tj  T can
be represented by a vector t = (1, 2..m) where i is the frequency of a word
i in t and m denotes the total number of words in t. Each news article n  N is
also represented as a vector n = (1, 2..k) where i is the frequency of a word
i in the title of the news article n and k denotes the total number of words in n.
The bag-of-word strategy relates a tweet t with the news article n, for which
the T F  IDF score is maximized: (t, n)  Rb, where Rb  T  N.
The bag-of-words strategy thus compares a tweet t with every news article in
N and chooses the most similar ones to build a relation between t and the
corresponding article n. T F  IDF is applied to measure the similarity. Given
a Twitter post t and a news article n, the term frequency T Fi of a term i (with
i > 0 in the vector representation of t) is i, i.e. the number of occurrences
of the word i in n. And IDFi, the inverse document frequency, is IDFi =
|{nN :i>0}|+1), where |{n  N : i > 0}| is the number of news articles,
1 + log(
in which the term i appears. Given T F and IDF , the similarity between t and
n is calculated as follows.

|N|

m

sim(t, n) =

i=1

T Fi  IDFi

(1)

Given a ranking according to the above similarity measure, we select top
ranked tweet-news pairs (t, n) as candidates for constructing a valid relation.
Following the realtime nature of Twitter, we also add a temporal constraint to
filter out these candidates, for which the publishing date of the Twitter message
and news article differs more than two days.

The bag-of-words strategy treats all words in a Twitter post as equally im-
portant. However, in Twitter, hashtags can be considered as special words that
are important features to characterize a tweet [11]. For news articles, some keywords such as person names, locations, topics, etc. are also good descriptors to
characterize a news article. Conveying these observations, we introduce hashtagbased and entity-based strategies for discovering relations between tweets and
news articles. These strategies follow the idea of the bag-of-words strategy (see
Definition 3) and differ in the way of representing news articles and tweets.

Definition 4 (Hashtag-based strategy). The hashtag-based strategy represents a Twitter post t  T via its hashtags: h = (1, 2..m), where i is the
number of occurrences of a hashtag i in t and m denotes the total number of
hashtags in t.

F. Abel et al.

The hashtag-based strategy relates a tweet t (represented via its hashtags) with
the news article n, for which the T F  IDF score is maximized: (t, n)  Rh,
where Rh  T  N.
While the hashtag-based strategy thus varies the style of representing Twitter
messages, the entity-based strategy introduces a new approach for representing
news articles.
Definition 5 (Entity-based strategy). Twitter posts t  T are represented
by a vector t = (1, 2..m) where i is the frequency of a word i in t and m
denotes the total number of words in t. Each news article n  N is represented by
means of a vector n = (1, 2..k), where i is the frequency of an entity within
the news article, i is the label of the entity and k denotes the total number of
distinct entities in the news article n.

The entity-based strategy relates the Twitter post t (represented via bag-of-
words) with the news article n (represented via the labels of entities mentioned in
n), for which the T F  IDF score is maximized: (t, n)  Re, where Re  T  N.
Entities are extracted by exploiting OpenCalais as described in Section 3. For
the hashtag- and entity-based strategies, we thus use Equation 1 to generate
a set of candidates of related tweet-news pairs and then filter out these pairs,
which do not fulfill the temporal constraint that prescribes that the tweet and
news article should be published within a time span of two days. Such temporal
constraints may reduce the recall but have a positive effect on the precision as
we will see in our analysis below.

4.2 Analysis and Evaluation
To analyze the impact of the strategies on semantic enrichment of Twitter posts,
we evaluate the performance of the strategies with respect to coverage and precision based on a large data corpus which we crawled from Twitter and three
major news media sites: BBC, CNN and New York Times.

Data Collection and Characteristics. Over a period of three weeks we
crawled Twitter information streams via the Twitter streaming API. We started
from a seed set of 56 Twitter accounts (Un), which are maintained by people
associated with one of the three mainstream news publishers, and gradually extended this so that we finally observed the Twitter activities of 48,927 extra
users (Uu), who are not explicitly associated with BBC, CNN or the New York
Times. The extension was done in a snowball manner: we added users to Uu,
who interacted with another user u  Un  Uu. The 56 Twitter accounts closely
related to mainstream news media enable publishers of news articles to discuss
their articles and news events with the Twitter audience. For the 48,927 casual
users we crawled all Twitter activities independently whether the activity was
part of an interaction with the Twitter accounts of the mainstream news media
or not. In total we thereby obtained more than 3.3 million tweets.

Figure 2 shows the number of tweets per user and depicts how often these
users interacted with a Twitter account associated with mainstream media. The
?

Fig. 2. Number of tweets per user u Uu as well as the number of interactions (re-tweeting
or reply activities) with Twitter accounts maintained by mainstream news media

distribution of the number of tweets per user shows a power-law-like distribution.
For many users we recorded less than 10 Twitter activities within the three week
observation period. Less than 500 users were highly active and published more
than 1000 tweets. Further, the majority (more than 75%) of users interacted
only once with a news-related user u  Un. We observed only nine users, who
re-tweeted or replied to messages from news-related users more than 100 times
and identified one of these users as spam user, who just joined the discussion to
promote Web sites.

To connect tweets with news articles, we further crawled traditional news me-
dia. Each of the three mainstream news publishers (BBC, CNN, and New York
Times) also provides a variety of news channels via their Web site. These news
channels correspond to different news categories such as politics, sports, or culture and are made available via RSS feed. We constantly monitored 63 different
RSS feeds from the corresponding news publishers and crawled the main content
as well as supplemental metadata (title, author, publishing data, etc.) of more
than 44,000 news articles.

Experimental Results. In order to evaluate the accuracy of the different
strategies for relating tweets with news articles, we randomly selected tweetnews pairs that were correlated by a given strategy and judged the relatedness
of the news article and the tweet message on a scale between 1 (not related)
and 4 (perfect match), where 2 means not closely related and 3 denotes re-
lated tweet-news pairs. For example, given a Twitter message about Francesca
Schiavones victory at French Open 2010, we considered news articles that report about this victory as perfect match while news articles about Francesca
Schiavone, for which this victory is not the main topic but just mentioned as
background information were considered as related. In total, we (the authors
of this paper) judged 1427 tweet-news pairs where each of the strategies depicted in Figure 3 was judged at least 200 times. For 85 pairs (5.96%) we were
not able to decide whether the corresponding Twitter posts and the news article
are related. We considered these pairs as not related and tweet-news relations,
which were rated at least with 3 as truly related.

(considered to refer to accurate).

Given this ground truth of correct tweet-news relations, we compare the precision of the different strategies, i.e. the fraction of correctly generated tweet-news
relations. Figure 3 plots the results and shows that the URL-based strategies
perform best with a precision of 80.59% (strict) and 78.8% (lenient) respec-
tively. The naive content-based strategy, which utilizes the entire Twitter message (excluding stop-words) as search query and applies TFxIDF to rank the
news articles, performs worst and is clearly outperformed by all other strategies.
It is interesting to see that the entity-based strategy, which considers the publishing date of the Twitter message and news article, is nearly as good as the
lenient URL-based strategy and clearly outperforms the hashtag-based strategy,
which uses the temporal constraints as well. Even without considering temporal constraints, the entity-based strategy results in higher accuracy than the
hashtag-based strategy. We conclude that the constellation/set of entities mentioned in a news article and Twitter message correspondingly, i.e. the number
of shared entities, is a good indicator of relating tweets and news articles.

Figure 4 shows the coverage of the strategies, i.e. the number of tweets per
user, for which the corresponding strategy found an appropriate news article.
The URL-based strategies, which achieve the highest accuracy, are very restric-
tive: for less than 1000 users the number of tweets that are connected to news
articles is higher than 10. The coverage of the lenient URL-based strategy is
clearly higher than for the strict one, which can be explained by the number of
interactions with Twitter accounts from mainstream news media (see Figure 2).
The hashtag-based and entity-based strategies even allow for a far more higher
number of tweet-news pairs. However, the hashtag-based strategy fails to relate
tweets for more than 79% of the users, because most of these people do not make
use of hashtags. By contrast, the entity-based strategy is applicable for the great
majority of people and, given that it showed an accuracy of more than 70% can
be considered as the most successful strategy.

Combining all strategies results in the highest coverage: for more than 20%
of the users, the number of tweet-news relations is higher than 10. In the next
section we will show that given these tweet-news relations we can create rich
profiles that go beyond the variety of profiles, which are just constructed based
on the tweets of the users.

5 Analyzing User Profile Construction Based on

Semantic Enrichment

Based on the linkage of Twitter activities with news articles, we can exploit the
semantics embodied in the news articles to create and enrich user profiles. In this
section, we first present approaches for user modeling based on Twitter activities
and then analyze the impact of exploiting related news articles for user profile
construction in Twitter.

5.1 User Modeling Strategies

In this study we focus on two types of profiles: entity-based and topic-based
profiles. An entity-based profile models a users interests into a given set of
entities such as persons, organizations, or events and can be defined as follows.
Definition 6 (Entity-based profile). The entity-based profile of a user u 
U is a set of weighted entities where the weight of an entity e  E is computed
by a certain strategy w with respect to the given user u.
P (u) = {(e, w(u, e))|e  E, u  U}

(2)

w(u, e) is the weight that is associated with an entity e for a given user u. E

and U denote the set of entities and users respectively.

In Twitter, a naive strategy for computing a weight w(u, e) is to count the number of us tweets that refer to the given entity e. |P (u)| depicts the number of
distinct entities that appear in a profile P (u). While entity-based profiles represent a user in a detailed and fine-grained fashion, topic-based profiles describe
a users interests into topics such as sports, politics or technology that can be
specified analogously (see Definition 7).

Definition 7 (Topic-based profile). The topic-based profile PT (u) of a user
u  U is the restriction of an entity-based profile P (u) to a set of topics T  E.

F. Abel et al.

From a technical point of view, both types of profiles specify the interest of a user
into a certain URI, which represents an entity or topic respectively. Given the
URI-based representation, the entity- and topic-based profiles become part of the
Web of Linked Data and can therewith not only be applied for personalization
purposes in Twitter (e.g., recommendations of tweet messages or information
streams to follow) but in in other systems as well. For the construction of entityand topic-based profiles we compare the following two strategies.

Tweet-based. The tweet-based baseline strategy constructs entity- and topicbased user profiles by considering only the Twitter messages posted by a
user, i.e. the first step of our user modeling approach depicted in Figure 1(a)
is omitted so that tweets are not linked to news articles. Entities and topics
are directly extracted from tweets using OpenCalais. The weight of an entity
corresponds to the number of tweets, from which an entity was successfully
extracted, and the weight of a topic corresponds to the number of tweets,
which were categorized with the given topic.

News-based. The news-based user modeling strategy applies the full pipeline of
our architecture for constructing the user profiles (see Figure 1(a)). Twitter
messages are linked to news articles by combining the URL-based and entitybased (with temporal restrictions) strategies introduced in Section 4 and
entities and topics are extracted from the news articles, which have been
linked with the Twitter activities of the given user. The weights correspond
again to the number of Twitter activities which relate to an entity and topic
respectively.

Our hypothesis is that the news-based user modeling strategy, which benefits
from the linkage of Twitter messages with news articles, creates more valuable
profiles than the tweet-based strategy.

5.2 Analysis and Evaluation

To validate our hypothesis we randomly selected 1000 users (from Uu) and applied both strategies to create semantic user profiles from their Twitter activ-
ities. Figure 5 compares the number of distinct entities and topics available in
the corresponding profiles (|P (u)|). Even though the number of Twitter activ-
ities, which can be linked to news articles, is smaller than the total number of
Twitter activities of a user (cf. Fig. 2, Fig. 4), the number of entities and topics
available in the profiles generated via the news-based strategy is higher than for
the tweet-based approach. Regarding the entity-based profiles this difference is
higher than for the topic-based profiles, because each Twitter message and news
article is usually categorized with one topic at most whereas for the number
of entities there is no such limit. News articles provide much more background
information (a higher number of entities) than Twitter messages and thus allow
for the construction of more detailed entity-based user profiles.

Further, the variety of the entity-based profiles generated via the news-based
strategy is much higher than for the tweet-based strategy as depicted in
Figure 5(c). For the tweet-based strategy, more than 50% of the profiles contain

(a) for creating entity-based profiles and (b) topic-based profiles, (c) with respect to
the variety of facet types available in the user profiles (example facet types: person,
event, location, product). Further, (d) hashtag-based vs. entity-based profiles: number
of distinct hash tags and entities per profile.

just less than four types of entities (mostly persons and organizations) while for
the news-based strategy more than 50% of the profiles reveal interests in more
than 20 types of entities. For example, they show that users are  in addition
to persons or organizations  also concerned with certain events or products.
The news-based strategy, i.e. the complete user construction pipeline proposed
in Figure 1, thus allows for the construction of profiles that cover different facets
of interests which increases the number of applications that can be built on top
of our user modeling approaches (e.g., product recommendations).

Related research stresses the role of hashtags for being valuable descriptors [11,12,10]. However, a comparison between hashtag-based profiles and entitybased profiles created via the news-based strategy shows that for user modeling
on Twitter, hashtags seem to be a less valuable source of information. Figure 5(d)
reveals that the number of distinct hashtags available in the corresponding user
profiles is much smaller than the number of distinct entities that are discovered
with our strategy, which relates Twitter messages with news articles. Given that
each named entity as well as each topic of an entity- and topic-based user profile
has a URI, the semantic expressiveness of profiles generated with the news-based
user modeling strategy is much higher than for the hashtag-based profiles.

6 Conclusions and Future Work

In this article, we introduced and analyzed strategies that enrich the semantics of
microblogging activities for creating semantically rich user profiles on the Social
Web. We present different strategies that connect Twitter messages with related
news articles and exploit semantics extracted from news articles to deduce and
contextualize the semantic meaning of individual Twitter posts. Our evaluation
on a large Twitter dataset (more than 3 million tweets posted by more than
45,000 users) showed that, given the name of entities mentioned in a news article
(such as persons or organizations) as well as the temporal context of the article,
we can relate tweets and news articles with high precision (more than 70%)
and high coverage (approx. 15% of the tweets can be linked to news articles).
Our analysis further revealed that the exploitation of tweet-news relation has
significant impact on user modeling and allows for the construction of more
meaningful profiles (more profile facets and more detailed knowledge regarding
user interests/concerns) than user modeling based on tweets only.

Semantic enrichment of Twitter user activities based on semantics extracted
from news articles thus leads to meaningful representations of Twitter activities,
ready for being applied in Twitter and other Social Web systems. In our ongoing research, we would deepen the investigation of how the profiles constructed
by this type of user modeling strategies impact personalization on the Social
Web5. Given the variety and recency of the constructed profiles, there are different applications worthwhile to explore such as Twitter stream and message
recommendations, product recommendations or recommending news.
