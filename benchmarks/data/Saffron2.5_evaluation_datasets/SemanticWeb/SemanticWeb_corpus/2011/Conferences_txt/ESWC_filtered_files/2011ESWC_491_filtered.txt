Abstract. Many tasks in semantic content creation, from building and
aligning vocabularies to annotation or data interlinking, still require human intervention. Even though automatic methods addressing the aforementioned challenges have reached a certain level of maturity, user input
is still required at many ends of these processes. The idea of human computation is to rely on the human user for problems that are impossible
to solve for computers. However, users need clear incentives in order to
dedicate their time and manual labor to tasks. The OntoGame series
uses games to hide abstract tasks behind entertaining user interfaces
and gaming experiences in order to collect knowledge. SeaFish is a game
for collaborative image annotation and interlinking without text. In this
latest release of the OntoGame series, players have to select images that
are related to a concept that is represented by an image (from DBpedia)
from a collection of images (produced by querying f lickrT M wrappr with
the respective concept). The data collected by SeaFish is published as
Linked Data on the Web. In this paper we outline the SeaFish game and
demo.

Keywords: Games for semantic content creation, Image annotation,
Linked Open Data, multimedia interlinking.

1 Motivation

The automated interpretation and description of images is still a major challenge.
CAPTCHAs are still a prime example for a task that is trivial for a human user
but impossible for a computer [6], allowing the distinction between a human user
and a machine. The paradigm of human computation is also the foundation for
games with a purpose [4] which aim to exploit human intelligence for solving computationally difficult tasks by masquerading them as games. Thereby,
an abstract (knowledge acquisition or curation) task is not only hidden behind
an attractive, easy-to-understand user interface but users are also given incentives to dedicate their time to solving the task. Playing, competition, and social

recognition are core motivational mechanisms of games. The OntoGame series
uses casual games in order to acquire human input for several semantic content
creation tasks, such as ontology building (e.g. the OntoPronto game), video annotation (e.g. the OntoTube game), or ontology alignment (e.g. the SpotTheLink
game).

In this paper we present the SeaFish game and describe its demo as planned
for ESWC 2011. SeaFish is the latest release of the OntoGame series. SeaFish is
a game for collaborative image annotation and interlinking without text. Players have to select images that are related to a concept that is represented by
an image (from DBpedia) from a collection of images (produced by querying
f lickrT M wrappr1 with the respective concept). Players get points based on their
degree of consensus with the player community. The data collected by SeaFish
is published as Linked Data on the Web.

SeaFish does not involve any reading for annotation. It solely relies on images.
This means that the game can be played in a fast pace as reading takes more
time than just looking at a visual representation of a concept. Moreover, the
game is not constrained by language or reading limitations. The resulting data is
published as Linked Data and thus, SeaFish implements game-based multimedia
interlinking as described by Buerger and colleagues[2].

Related work. We sketch related work focusing on games for the creation of image
annotations. A comprehensive list of games for knowledge acquisition is available
at the INSEMTIVES homepage2. Luis von Ahn introduced the ESP game[7]
aka Googles Image Labeler for annotating images. Additioinally, he created
other serious games that are published at the GWAP homepage3. PopVideo4
aims to label videos and Waisda5 allows players to tag live TV shows. Magic
Bullet[9] evaluates the robustness of Captchas, TagCaptcha[3] produces image
annotations as side product of the CAPTCHA process. Finally, Picture This 6 is
another game for annotating images, however, unlike the ESP game users dont
create tags but have to decide on the best matching tag.

2 Collaborative and Game-Based Image Annotation

SeaFish SeaFish is a single player game where players have to fish related images
that are floating around. Users can play from the OntoGame website7 as either
registered user or as anonymous guest. Players may also login via Facebook by
visiting the OntoGame Facebook page8. After they clicked the SeaFish! button

the game starts. From there players may either get playing instructions or start
a game. Each game round is about a concept taken from DBpedia that is represented by an image. Players see this image on the right hand side. Additionally,
players see the result of an search for the concept on f lickrT M wrappr, which
are floating through the main screen (see Figure 1). Players have 2 minutes to
mark those images as either related to the concept or unrelated to the concept.
They can do so by catching the images with the fishing rod and dragging them
either to the green basket (related) or the red basket (not related).

Players always obtain a small reward for catching an image. Generally, players
get more points depending on whether their decision is consensual with decisions
of the majority of other players. Additionally, the reward a player gets always
depends on their reliability as well as their level. When an image is caught a
new image appears in order to have less than ten images floating on the screen
at the same time. The game stops when all images have been fished or the time
is up. After each game round (see Figure 2) players can compare their answers
with the communitys answers as well as view statistics on accuracy and time.

To give an example of Seafish: in a game round the player is shown an image of
Blackberry (see Figure 1) on the right hand side (retrieved from DBpedia). As a
result of the query Blackberry on f lickrT M wrappr, pictures are floating around
on the main screen. The task of the player is to select those image that are
related to the concept Blackberry(the berry) and those that are not by putting
images in the Discard or Catch baskets on the bottom of the screen.

Data export. SeaFish exports annotations as RDF triples. In our first scenario
we create annotations of the form <image><http://xmlns.com/foaf/spec/depic-
tion><concept>as well as the inverse property. Our concepts are taken from
DBpedia plus follow the four Linked Open Data principles[1]. This means that
our data may be used to contribute to the Linked Open Data cloud without
being modified.

Our annotations are generated from stored answers in the following manner:
let si be an answer that states an image is related to a concept, i a number
greater than six, ri the reliability of the player giving the answer at the time of
the answer and n the number of total answers stored about an image. A players
reliability is a measurement of how accurate this player played in previous games.

3 Discussion and Outlook

Currently, three months after the initial release of SeaFish we have collected
feedback, implemented the proposed changes and re-released the game. A still
open issue is the lack of returning player. To counter this we have integrated
leveling mechanisms. We have integrated it on Facebook to profit from the social network effect. We are currently evaluating the outcome of these measures.
Besides, we also evaluate the effect of tweaking the rewarding function on the
quality of the generated annotations.

S. Thaler et al.

We also identified a possible extension of SeaFish: Ookaboo9 is an API that
links pictures to concepts from different Linked Open Data sources and makes
them searchable. SeaFish could on the one hand be used to verify the data
provided on Ookaboo. On the other hand it could also be used to provide new
image tags.

Another possibility to attract more players is a planned feature to allow users

to add their own category of concepts to play in the games.

4 Conclusion

At ESWC 2011 the audience of the demo players will be able to play the games
of the OntoGame series (including Seafish) and can see how and which data is
generated. In this paper, we have described the SeaFish game for collaborative
image annotation. We are currently collecting massive user input in order to
thoroughly evaluate the game by assessing the quality of generated data and the
user experience.
