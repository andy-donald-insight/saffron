1. Introduction
This article describes an experiment approaching syntactical analysis of l ' or tugues e based on Tree Adjoining Grammars  ( TAGs ) \[JOSltl 75\] . It briefly presents the TAG formalism , placing it among other description tbrmalisms used for natural language processing  , and introduces a prototype which is being developed in order to validate application of this formalism to 
Portuguese language.
The present work concern sentence analysis at syntaclical evel  , which can be viewed as a process with two main ftmctions for natural language processing : the identification of the input components hrough association of tree structures to sentences  , and regularization of the identified structure in order to minimize the number of trees for each sentence \ [  GR1StlMAN   86\]  . 
Although ContextFree Grammars ( CFG ) have been the most studied ones in order to describe natural language  , purely context-fieegranlmars are not adequate for this description \[ R/Ctt  91\]  . 
Context-Sensitive Grammars ( CSG ) are also used for description of natural languages  , however they have not been proven to be a suitable tbmmlism ~ brstating most grammatical constraints\[GRISHMAN  86\]  . 

Categorial Grammars ( CG ) seem to be a tendency for natural language description  , including several related formalisms , all involved with the foundations of modern syntactic and semantics theories \[ STE EDMAN  93\]  . 
Among the formalisms related to Categorial Grammars we can mention Tree Adjoining Grammars  ( TAGs ) \[JOSHI75\]\[JOSHI85\] , Lexical Functional Grammar \[ BRESNAN82\] , Dependency Grammar \[ HUDSON 82\] and Generalized Phrase Structure Grammar \ [ GAZDAR  85\]  . These grammatical formalisms and linguistic theories are based on unification and specification of constraints for definition of the possible structures to be unified  . 
This article is organized in four items . After a brief introduction , we present the Tree Adjoining Grammars formalism , describing its main components and operations , We comment our steps toward construction of a syntactical analyzer for Portuguese language and make some consideration about the prototype described  . 
2. Tree Adjoining Grammars
Tree Adjoining Grammars were first described by \[ JOSHI  75\]  , as a tree based system , where the basic component is a set of element a , 3 , trees . Each tree represents a minimal linguistic structure and is a domain of locality  . A TAG comprises two kinds of elemental 3 , trees : initial trees , which are complete structures , with preterminals on the leaves ; auxiliary trees , which must have exactly one leaf node with the same syntactic ategory of the root node  . 
The elementary trees localize dependencies , like agreement , subcategorization , etc . and must have at least one terminal node . 
Sentences generated from a language defined by a TAG can be derived by the composition of an initial tree and elementary trees  , through two operations : substitution and adjunction  . 
Substitution , as showed in Fig 1 , inserts an initial tree ( oi-a tree derived fiom an initial tree ) on tile correspondent leaf node in the elementary tree  . 
Adjunction , as showed in Fig 2 , inserts an auxiliary tree on the correspondent node in an elementary or derived tree  . 


Fig 1 -Substitution/\Fig 2 -Adjunction Z ~ The adjunction operation can be recursive  , then an auxiliary tree can receive adjunction in itself  . Adjunction allows an insertion of a complete structure on a node of another complete structure  . 
Adjunction makes TAGs a little more powerful then ContextFree Grammars  ( CFG )  , placing it in a class of grammars called Midly Context-Sensitive Grammars \[ JOSHI  85\]  . This operation preserves the dependencies among unbounded structures of the sentence  . 
3. Portuguese analysis with TAGs
Several research groups are working with Tree Adjoining Grammars  . There are descriptions of grammars for French\[ ABEILLE  91\]  , English \[ SCHABES88\] , a study for German \[ RAMBOW92\] , among other languages . 
In order to analyze Portuguese language , there are many studies being developed , in Brazil and Portugal , which approach different formalisms . These researches focus punctual areas as lexical analysis\[COURTIN  89\]  , database queries using natural anguage\[ BIGOLIN  93\]  , semantic analysis\[FREITAS93\]\[LUZ93\] , etc . 
In TAGt brlnalism we can find aspects that help syntactic analysis of Portuguese  , t brexample , the possibility to have unboundness dependencies , such as agreement , among nodes . 
Jog\[o , qucfalap or hlgu~s , csludain form fitica . l We are working on a grammar to describe Portuguese  , and we are developing a syntactical analyzer for this grammar  . One of the problems wet ~ aced was the absence of a description of so we selected the subse to work with  . 
We decided by a large subset , which includes active and passive voice , relative and interrogative clauses , auxiliary and support verbs , and clitic pronouns . 
The syntactical categories included are verbs , nouns , pronouns , adjectives , adverbs , articles and prepositions . For each one of the categories there are syntactical traits associated like : concrete  , abstract , number , gender , person , mode , voice ,   . . . 
The grammar is organized according to the formalism  , using initial trees and auxiliary trees to describe surface structures of Portuguese language  . These study was based on Portuguese normative grammars \[ ROCHALIMA  92\]  , and generative grammars \[ LOBATO86\] . 
Example of initial trees :
S/\
NV iI
Jojo corre

WN VN
Porque Jogoe studa Int brmfitica ?
Example of auxiliary trees :

Adj NArt N
IIL be logatoog a to be load j\
A ~ Upequeno
Its important to observe that each one of the nodes associated to a tree has traits used t'or unification  , and can have dependency traits between unbounded nodes  . These dependency traits are kept under an adjunction operation  . 
The first version of the syntactical analyzer , based upon TAGs , includes the acquisition of adjunct km and substitution  )  , and unification of the input sentence with the solution tree  . Note that the analyzer must return all the derived trees t br the given input sentence  . 
The elementary trees are supposed to contain intbrmation about the hierarchy of the nodes  , type of that tree ( relative , interrogative ,  . . . ) , operations that can be made on each node , and traits to be unified Syntactical analyzer input sentence comes fl'om a morphological analyzer that splits this sentence in components such as words or expressions  , associating them a set of traits . 
Construction of the deriw , ' d tree is made by adjunction and substitution operations over elementary trees  . Unification compare straits of the input sentence with the traits described on TAG trees  , producing the resulting trees . 
Inclusion of semantic traits will allow us to upgrade this analyzer in a semantic-syntactic analyzer  , anticipating evahmtion of semantic traits to syntactic alnalysis  , reducing the number of resulting trees . 
4. Final remarks
In the scope of a project aiming to develop tools to treat Portuguese at morphological  , syntactic and semantic levels , we started with l norphological level , and we calne to an implementation farobust lexical-morphological analyzer throughtrie trees \[STRUBE DELIMA  93\]  . As a next step , we approached syntactical level looking for a tbrmalism adequate to support Portuguese language  . A large subset ot'this language was outlined , which should give rise to an experiment of implementation of algorithms and data structures for parsing 

This seems to be the fhst study using Tree Adjoining Granunars for Portuguese language  . Our contribution would state on description ol'a large subset of the language  , construction of " trees that represent syntactic structures for Pomtgucse  , and development of a parser , according to the formalism . 
We described around 300 inicial trees in order to cover the subset outlined  , and developed a bottom-up LR parser working efficiently  . We are now studying complementary data structures as a syntactical dictionary in order to improve the parser  . This dictionary would be hcll ) fulto construct the solution tree , searching \[' astly the trees that can be used tbraword  . We are also syntactical analyzer developed . 
Tree Adjoining Grammars formalism , to this moment , seems to present aspects that benefit treatment o f Portuguese language in a robust way  . Acquisition of new trees can be made easily , as well as describing semantic traits together with the syntactical ones  .
