There are several linguistic phenomena that can be processed by morphological tools of agglutinative and other highly inflection a languages  , while processing of the same features need syntactic parsers in case of other languages  , like English . There are , however , only a few morphological systems that are both fast enough and linguistically sound  . I-lum0r , a reversible , string-based , unification approach is introduced in the paper that has been used for creating a variety of lingware applications  , like spellchecking , hyphenation , lemmatization , and of course , full morphological analysis and synthesis . Having discussed the philosophical and design decisions we show the abovementioned systems and then survey some competing approaches  . 
DESIGNPHILO SOPHY OF HUMOR
Several philosophical commitments regarding the NLP systems are summarized in Slocum  ( 1988 )  . 
t tumor has been designed according to the Slocum requirements  . It is language independent , that is , it allows multilingual applications . Besides agglutinative languages ( e . g . Hungarian , Turkish ) and highly inflection a languages ( e . g . Polish , Latin ) it has been applied to languages of major economic and demographic significance  ( e . g . 
English , German , French ) , H , mor overcomes simple orthographic errors and mis -typings  , thus it is a fault-tolerant system , The morphological analyzer version , for example , is able to analyze Hungarian texts from the 19th century when the orthographic system was not as uniform as nowadays  . Wordforms are first " autocorrected " into the standard orthography and then analyzed properly  . 
Example 1 : fault-tolerance in Humor >> h iv6 hiv => hiv\[V\]q <3\[PART  \]  ( calling ) >> galyakgaly=>gaily\[N\]Fak\[?L\] (  . fe1~c'es ) Humor descriptions are reversible . It means that there is an oppo1Iunity to input a stem and several suffixes and the system generates every possible word form satisfying the request

Synthesis :>> hAz\[N\]+\[ PERS-SG-2\] I\[INS\]h fizadda\] ( with yourhouse ) >> trend\[V\]+\[PERS-SG-2\]ra onds z , ll ~ on dasz ( you say ) The basic strategy of Humor is inherently suited to parallel execution  . Search inti remain dictionary , secondary dictionaries and affix dictionaries can happen at the same time  . What is more , a simultaneous processing level ( higher than morphology ) based on the same strategy is under development . 

In realworld applications , number of linguistic rules is an important source of grammatical complexity  . In the Humor strategy there is a single rule only that checks unifiability of feature graphs of subsequent substrmgs in the actual wordform  . It is very simple and clear , based on surface-only analyses , no transformations are used ; all the complexity of the system is hidden in the graphs describing morpho-graphemic behavior  .

Root dictionaries of the above mentioned la , -guagcs contain 25 . 000 -100 . 000 eutries . The Hungarian version (90 . 000 stems ) has been tested in everyday work since 1991 both by researdmrs of the Institute of " Linguistics of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences  ( Prdszdky and Tihanyi 1992 ) and users of word-processors and Drl'p systems ( Humor-based proofing tools have been licensed by Micro-solt  . Lot us and other software developers ) .

The morphological nalyzer is the kernel module of the system : a hnost all of the applications derived From Humor based on it  . Humor has a guessing strategy that is based on orthographic  , moqJho-phonological , morphological and lexical properties oF the words  . It operates after the analysis module , mostly used in the sl ) ellmg checkers based on Humor and m the above mentioned  19th centmaj corpus application .

For internal use we have developed a defaulting subsystem that is able to propose the most likely inflectional paradigm  ( s ) for a base word . There are only a few moq ) hologically open word classes in the languages we have studied Paradigms that are difficult to classify are generally closed  ; no new words of the language follow their morpho -graphemic patterns  . The behavior of existing , productive paradigms is rather easy to describe algorithmically  . 
The coding subsystem of Slocum ( 1988 ) is represented by the socalled paradigm matrix of Humor systems  . It is defined Ibrevery possible allomorph : it gives infornmtion about the potential behavior of the stem allomotph before moqJhologically relevant affix families  .

There are only a few general , reversible morphological systems that can be used for more than a single language  . Besides the wellknown two-level morphology ( Koskenniemi 1983 ) and its modifications ( Katltmen 1985 , 1993) we mention the Nabusy stem ( Slocum 1988) . Molphological description systems without lmge implementations  ( like the paradigmatic morphology of Calder ( 1989 )  , or Paradigm Description Language of Anick and Artemieff  ( 1992 ) are not listed here , because their importance is mainly theoretical ( at least , for the time being ) . Two-level morphology is a reversible , orthography-based system that has several advantages from a linguist's point of view  . 
Namely , the morpho-phonenfic/graphemic rules can be t brmalized in a general and very elegant way  . It also has computation ald vantages , but the lexicons must contain entries with diacritics and other sophistications in order to produce the needed surface Yorms  . Non-linguist users need an easy-to-extend dictionary rote which words can be inserted  ( ahnost ) automatically . The lexical basis oF Humor contain surface characters only and no transformations are applied  . 
Compile time of a large Humor dictionary ( o\[90 . 000 entries ) is 12 minutes on an average PC , that is another advantage ( at least , for the linguist ) if comparing it with the two-level systems ' compilers  . The result of the compilation is a compressed structure that can be used by any applications derived from Humor  . The compression ratio is less than 20% . The size of the dictionary does not influence the speed of the runtime system  , because a special paging algorithm of our own is used  .

Humor systems have been implemented ( at various depth ) for English , German , French , Italian , Latin , Ancient Greek , Polish , Turkish , and it is fifly implemented for Hungarian . The whole software package is written in standard C using  C4-1 like objects . It runs on any platforms where C compiler can be found ~  . The Hungarian morphological na-lyzer which is the lalgest and most precise implementation eeds  900 K bytes disk space and around 100 K bytes of core memory . The stem dictionary contains more than 90 . 000 stems which cover all ( approx .  70 . 000 ) lexemes of the Concise Explana-tol~v Dictionary of the Itungarian Language  . Suf-lix dictionaries contain all the inflectional suffixes and the productive derivational nmr phemes of pres-ent-day Hungarian  . With the help of these dictionaries Humorisable to analyze and/or generate around  2  . 000 . 000 . 000 wellformed Hungarian word forms . 
Its speed is between 50 and 100 words/s on an average 40 MHz 386 machine . The whole system can be tuned 2 according to the speed requirements : the needed RAM size can be between  50 and 900 

There are several Hum0r subsystems with simplified output : lemmatizers , hyphenators , pelling checkers and correctors . They ( called Hdys~Lsm , Hslyess I and Hsly~s-e ? , respectively ) have been built into several word-processing and full text retrieval systems ' Hungarian versions  ( Word , Excel , Ami Pro , Word-
Perfect , Topic , etc.). ~
Besides the above wellknown applications there are two new tools based on the same strategy  , the re-flectional thesaurus called Hdy#t8 ( Prdsz6ky and Tihanyi 1992 ) and the series of int d ligent bilingual dictionaries called  NoBi0i0  . Both are dictionaries with morphological knowledge :  Hdysff0 is monolingual , while NoBil ) i0-as its name suggests -- bilingual . Having analyzed the input word the both systems look for the found stem in the main dictionary  . The inflectional thesauru stores the reforma-tion encoded m the analyzed affixes and adds to the synonym word chosen by the user  . The synthesis module of Humor starts to work now , and provides the user with the adequate inflected form of tim word in question  . This procedure has a great importance in case of highly inflectional languages  . 
The synonym system of Hslysff8 contains 40 . 000 head words . The first version of the inflectional the-saums HdysH8 needs 1  . 6M bytes disk space and runs under MS Windows . The size of the MoBiDic dictionary packages vary depending on the applied terminological collection  . E . g . the Hungarian -- English Business Dictionary ( Example 4 ) needs 1 . 8
Mbytes space . 4
Besides the above mentioned products , a Hungarian grammar checker ( called Hs Iy 6~6bb ) and other syn-tax-based ( and higher level ) mono - and multilingual applications derived also from the basic  Hum0r algorithm are under development .
