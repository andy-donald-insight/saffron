Abstract
We introduce a new type of discourse constraints for the interaction of discourse relations with the configuration of discourse segments . We examine corpus-extracted examples as soft constraints . We show how to use Regular Tree Gramamrs to process such constraints , and how the representation of some constraints depends on the expressive power of this formalism.
1 Introduction
Discourse structures cannot always be described completely , either because they are ambiguous ( Stede , 2004), or because a discourse parser fails to analyse them completely . In either case , underspecification formalisms ( UFs ) can be used to represent partial information on discourse structure . UFs are used in semantics to model structural ambiguity without disjunctive enumeration of the readings ( van Deemter and Peters , 1996).
Underspecified descriptions of discourse must handle two kinds of incomplete information , on the configuration of discourse segments ( how they combine into larger units ), and on the discourse relations that bring about this configuration : Our corpus studies on the RST Discourse Treebank ( Carlson et al , 2002) showed interdependencies between relations and configuration , a phenomenon first noted by ( Corston-Oliver , 1998).
These interdependencies can be formulated as constraints that contribute to the disambiguation of underspecified descriptions of discourse structure.
E.g ., in discourse segments constituted by the relation Condition , the premiss tends to be a disc ? 2008. Licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike 3.0 Unported license ( http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/).

Similarly , there is evidence for an interdependency constraint for the relation Purpose(1) Purpose(1) has a discourse atom as its nucleus.
The corpus evaluation furthermore shows that those patterns never occur exclusively but only as tendencies . Realised as soft constraints , such tendencies can help to sort the set of readings according to the established preferences , which allows to focus on the best reading or the nbest readings . This is of high value for an UF-based approach to discourse structure , which must cope with extremely high numbers of readings . To model interdependency constraints , we will use Regular Tree Grammars ( RTGs ) ( Comon et al , 2007). RTGs can straightforwardly be extended to weighted Regular Tree Grammars ( wRTGs ), which can represent both soft and hard constraints.
Apart from our corpus-extracted examples , we also consider a hard interdependency constraint similar to the Right Frontier Constraint . We show that we can integrate this attachment constraint with our formalism , and how its representation depends on the expressiveness of RTGs.
2 Underspecified Discourse Structure
We describe ( partial ) information on discourse structure by expressions of a suitable UF , here , dominance graphs ( Althaus et al , 2003). Consider e.g . Fig . 1(a ), the dominance graph for (1): (1) [ C [ C [ C Thompson , 1988), most discourse relations have a central nucleus argument , and a peripheral satellite argument . For Condition , the premiss is the satellite , the nucleus , the conclusion.
2 ?( n )? as part of a relation name indicates that the nucleus is its nth argument ; relations with names without such an affix are multinuclear , i.e ., link two segments of equal prominence . We sometimes omit the numbers where the position of the nucleus is clear from the context.

Their key ingredient are ( reflexive , transitive and antisymmetric ) dominance relations , which are indicated by dotted lines . Dominance of X including ) X rial intervening between X

They model the potential discourse structures for (1) ( see Webber (2004)). Dominance graphs like Fig . 1a . are pure chains . Pure chains describe all binary trees with the same leaf language , here the discourse segments , in their textual order . Pure chains define a left-to-right order , in that not only the leaves always form the same sequence , but also the inner nodes : If a labelled node X is further to the left in the chain than another node Y , in every described tree , X will either be Y?s left child , or Y will be X?s right child , or there will be a fragment F of which X is a successor on the left and Y is a right successor . Henceforth we will refer to fragments with their index in the chain ( indicated by encircled numbers in Fig . 1a).
3 Representing Soft Interdependencies
The interdependency constraint for Condition(1) is that its satellite tends to be maximally short , i.e ., mostly consists of only one discourse atom , and in most remaining cases , of two atoms . Thus , ( b ) and ( d ) are preferred among the configurations in Fig . 1, ( c ) is less preferred , and ( e ) and ( f ) are the least preferred . Regular Tree Grammars ( RTGs ) as UF ( Koller et al , 2008) can express such complex constraints straightforwardly , and provide a convenient framework to process them . They allow to extract a best configuration with standard algorithms very efficiently.
Koller et al (2008) show how to generate an RTG describing the same set of trees as a dominance graph . Similar to a context free grammar , an RTG uses production rules with terminal symbols and nonterminal symbols ( NTs ), whereby the lefthand side ( LHS ) is always a nonterminal and the righthand side ( RHS ) contains at least one terminal symbol . One NT is the start symbol . A tree is accepted by the grammar if the grammar contains a derivation for it . An example for an RTG is given in Fig . 2, which describes the same trees as the dominance graph in Fig . 1a . The start symbol is {17}. To derive e.g . the tree in Fig . 1d , we first select the rule {17} ? Cause({1-3}, {57}) that determines Condition as root for the whole tree.
The left child of Condition is then derived from {17}, and the right child from {57} respectively.
To emphasize the association with the dominance graph , we mark nonterminals as the subgraphs they represent , e.g ., {17} denotes the whole graph.
The terminal in the RHS of a grammar rule determines the root of the LHS subgraph.
Koller et al (2008) also use weighted RTGs ( wRTGs , an extension of RTG with weights ) to express soft dominance constraints ( which , unlike hard constraints , do not restrict but rather rank the set of configurations ). We use wRTGs to model the soft interdependency constraints . The grammar in Fig . 2 is also a wRTG that assigns a weight to each derived tree : Its weight is the product over all weights of all rules used for the derivation.
Weights appear in squared brackets after the rules.
36
The ( merely expository ) weights in our example encode the preference of Condition for a maximally short right child : There are three grammar rules that establish Condition as the root of a subgraph ( shaded in Fig . 2), which are distinguished by the size of the right child of the root ( one ({3}), three ({35}) or five ({37}) nodes ). The shorter the right child , the higher the weight associated with the rule . (1 is a neutral weight by definition .) The grammar thus assigns different weights to the trees in Fig . 1; ( b ) and ( d ) get the maximum weight of 9, ( b ), a medium weight of 3, and ( e ) and ( f ), the lowest weight of 1.
4 Expressive Power of RTGs
As Koller et al (2008) show , the expressive power of RTGs is superior to other common underspecification formalism . We show an important application of the increased expressiveness with Ex . 2, where a . can be continued by b . but not by c : (2) a . [ C [ C [ C pub ] [ C b . [ C 5a
She complained bitterly about his behaviour .] c . [ C 5b He left after his fifth pint of lager.]
Segment C 5a continues the preceding clause about Mary?s visit with additional information about the visit , it thus attaches directly to C find a coherent integration of C 5b , we would have to connect it to C about Max ? night at the pub . However , in the given constellation of C together , C ment of further discourse units . ( This constraint is reminiscent of the Right Frontier Constraint , as it is used by Asher and Lascarides (2003). However , it is unclear how the Right Frontier Constraint in its exact definition can carry over to binary trees .) The given attachment constraint is not expressible with dominance graphs : it excludes the configurations of its dominance graph ( Fig . 3) in which Contrast shows up as a direct left child , e.g ., (3b/e/f ) as opposed to (3c/d ). For instance , the excluded structure emerges in (3e/f ) by choosing Cause as root of the the subgraph 59 ( i.e ., including the Contrast - and Sequence-fragments ). For convenience , we will talk about this constraint as the ? left child constraint ? ( LCC).
S ? Contrast(S , S ) L ? Evid(S , S)
S ? Sequ(L , S ) L ? List(S , S)
S ? L
L ? C
This additional constraint , however , can be expressed by an RTG like Fig . 4. We explicitly distinguish between subgraphs ( referred to with numbers ) and their associated NTs here . Crucially , some subgraphs can be processed in different derivations here , e.g ., {59} ( as right child of List , irrespective of the relative scope of Evidence and List ), or {37} ( in the expansions of both { EvLiCo } and { LiCoSe }, like in (3c ) as opposed to (3d )). Sometimes this derivation history is irrelevant , like in the case of {59} ( here , only Contrast may be chosen as root anyway ), but there are cases where it matters : If {37} is the left child of Sequence , as in (3b/d ), the choice of Contrast as its root is excluded , since this would make Contrast the left child of Sequence , as in (3b ). In contrast , {37} as the right child of Evidence , like in (3c ), allows both Contrast and List as root , because Contrast emerges as a right child in either case . Thus , the two occurrences of {37} are distinguished in terms of different NTs in the grammar , and only in the NT for the latter occurrence is there more than one further expansion rule.
Regular tree languages are closed under intersection . Thus , one can derive a grammar like Fig . 4 by intersecting a completely underspecified RTG ( here , the one derived from Fig . 3a ) with a suitable filter grammar , e.g ., Fig . 4. The filter grammar produces an infinite language , containing the fragments of Fig . 3a and excluding any derivation in which Sequence is the direct parent of Contrast.
This is guaranteed by introducing the nonterminal L ( the left child NT for Sequence ), for which there is no derivation with Contrast as its root.
For an arbitrary pure chain with n fragments , the filter grammar generating the LCC is constructed as follows : S is the start symbol . For every fragment i s.t . 0 < i < n , there is a derivation rule with S as its LHS and i in its RHS , thus either S ? i , for singleton fragments , or S ? i(A,S ), for binary fragments . If i is binary , we must determine A : If there is at least one fragment f < i s.t . the LCC is assumed for f , we create a new
NT L i ; every derivation rule with i on its RHS follows the pattern X ? i(L i , S ) ( thus A = L i in particular ). If there is no LCC fragment to the left

0 < h < i and there is no LCC for h , there is a rewrite rule directly deriving h from L i . If h is a singleton fragment , the rule is L i ? h . Otherwise the rule is L i ? h(A ? , S ), whereby A ? = S , if there is no L h , or A ? = L h if there is some LCC fragment on the left of h.

The grammar in Fig . 4 can be generated with that scheme ; it has been reduced afterwards in that a general rule S ? L substitutes for all rules of the form S ? NT for which there is a corresponding rule L ? NT ( e.g ., S ? Evid(S , S)).
5 Conclusion
Interdependency constraints that arise from the interaction of discourse relations and their surrounding structures are introduced as a new technique for disambiguating discourse structure . We integrate those constraints in underspecified discourse structures by exploiting the expressive power of Regular Tree Grammars as UF . As the corpus analysis yields in many cases only soft interdependency constraints , we use the weighted extension of RTGs , which allows to sort the readings of an underspecified representation and to identify preferred discourse structures . We then showed that the representation of some discourse constraints depend on the expressive power of RTGs . For notes on implementation and tractability of our approach , see Regneri et al (2008).

To model this as a preference rather than as a hard constraint , no rules for the L-NTs are omitted , but rather weighted low . An intersection with a preference-neutral wRTG would rank the configurations violating the constraint low , and all others with neutral weights.
