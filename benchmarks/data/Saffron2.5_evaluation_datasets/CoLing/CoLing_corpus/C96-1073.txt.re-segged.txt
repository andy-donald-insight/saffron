Abstract 2 Focus theory
Pulman has shown that Higher-Order
Unif cation ( HOU ) can be used to model
the interpretation of focus . In this paper , we extend the unification based approach to cases which are often seen as a test bed for focus theory : utterances with multiple focus operators and second occurrence x pressions  . We then show that the resulting analysis favourably compares with two prominent theories of focus  ( namely , Rooth's Alternative Semantics and Krifka's Structured Meanoings theory  ) in that it correctly generates interpretations which these alternative theories cannot yield  . Finally , we discuss the formal properties of the approach and argue that even though 
HOU need not terminate , for the class of unification-problems dealt with in this paper  , HOU avoids this shortcoming and is in fact computationally tractable  . 
1 Introduction
In this paper , we argue that Higher Order Unification ( HOU ) provides a linguistically adequate tool for modeling the semantics of focus  . Building upon ( Pulman ,  1995) , we develop a unification-based analysis of focus which we show favourably compares with two prominent heories of focus  , Rooth's Alternative Semantics and Krifka's Structured Meanings theory  . For data which is generally viewed as a test bed for focus theory  ( utterances with multiple focus operators and second occurrence x pressions  )  , we show that contrary to Rooth's and Krifka's theories  , the HOU treatment yields a transparent analysis while avoiding under - and overgeneration  . 
Focus is a much debated notion . In this paper , we assume a simplifed version of Jackendoff's definition : a focus is the semantic value of a prosodi-tally prominent element  . We take the identification of prosodically prominent elements as given  . 
To set the stage for this paper , we will briefly review the folklore , i . e . the main issues of focus theory . It is commonly agreed that focus triggers the formation of an additional semantic value which we will call the Focus Seman-tic Value  ( FSV )  . The name and definition of the FSV varies from author to author : Jackendoff  ( Jackendoff , 1972) calls it the presuppositional set , Rooth ( Rooth , 1992) the Alternative Sct and Krifka ( Krifka , 1992) the Ground . In this paper , we assume a definition of the FSV which is in essence Rooth's Alternative set  , that is , tile set of semantic objects obtained by making an appropriate substitution in the focus position  . For instance , the FSV of ( la ) is defined as ( lb ) , the set of properties of the form like-lugy where y is an individual  ( in what follows , focus is indica~ted using uppercase ; we also follow Montague's convention that for any type % D ~ is the set of objects of type r and wff ~ is the set of wits of typer  )  . 
(1) a . J on only likes MARY b.ly c
It is also usuMly agreed that certain linguistic elements associate with focus in that the meaning of the utterance containing these elements varies depending on the choice of focus  . For instance in (2ab ) , the focus operator only associates with focus so that the difference in focus between  ( 2a ) and ( 2b ) induces a difference in meaning between the two utterances : in a world where a on introduced Paul to Mary and Sarah  , and no other introduction takes place , (2a ) is necessarily (2) a . Jononlyint , vduced Paul to MARY b .   . I on only intr ' od , tcedPAUL to Mary To model this " association with focus " phenomenon  , the semantics of associating-elements ( e . g . focus operators , q ttantifieation ald verbs ) is made contingent on the FSV which itself , wtries with the choice of focus . The following example illustrates this . Suppose that the meaning of o'nlg is determined by the following rule :\[ NP only VP\]vP\[P ~ FSVAP  ( NP ' ) - + P=VP'\] where NP' , VP ' represent he meaning of NP and VP respectively  , and t , kS'V stands for the focus semantic value of the VP  . As we have seen above , the FSV of ( la ) is ( lb ) , hence by the above semantic for only , the semantics of (1a ) is:
VP\[PGAx . l(x,~j)IY ~ D ~ AP ( j)-~\['=~z . l(x , m )\] Intuitively , the only property of the form like-ingy that holds of Jon is the property of like ing 

3 The basic analysis
For computing the Focus Semantic Value , we propose to use t\[igher Order Unification . More specitically , given ( part of ) an utterance U with semantic representation Sern and loci  F1   .   .   . b '' ~ , we require that the following equation , the ground equation , be solved :
Sere = Gd(l , ' t ) . . . ( t , '")
Assuming the typed A calculus as our semantic representation language  , this equation can be solved by Huet's algorithm ( cf . (ltuet , 1975)), thus assigning a value to Gd . On the basis of this value , we can then define the FSV , written Gd , ms follows : Definition 3 . 1  ( \[' beus Semantic Value ) Let G d be of type c ~= ~- + t and ~ be the number of loci  ( ~< k )  , then the fibcus Hemantic Value derivable f , ' omG d , " writlen (; d , is (; d(t' . . . *'~) It " i < wff ~ , . 
As mentioned before , this yields a focus semantic value which is in essence io oth's Alternative 
Set 1.
I Thonghin fact , our definition is more syntactic than Rooth . In Rooth's approach , the I " SV definition is purely semantic whereas in our approach the FSV is indirectly defined by solving equations and the value thus obtained  ( i . e . the value of Gd ) is a term , that is , a syntactic object . Hence , our I"SV can he more accurately contpared to Kratzer's presuppositior ~ skeletort  ,  . 
This means that our approach inherits the adwm tages of Kratzer's approach  ( c\[' . ( Kratzer , 1991)) . In par-F in Mly , we assume as in ( Pulman ,  \[995) , that loci ~ ire stored and discharged non deterministically as the need arises  , thus con-tributing to the definition of the ground equation  . 
li ' urthermore , equations are setup at the level at which there are neede de  . g . at the VP level in the case of a pre- . verbal focus operator . 
q billustrate the workings of onr approach , we now run through a simple example . Consider ( la ) . 
To determine the meaning of only likes MARY , the FSV of the VP nmst be known , ttence the following equation l nust be solved : : Gd  (  , ,O
BytIOU , the value of (- Id is then 2: ( ; d = AyAx . l(x,y )
And by definition (3 . 1) , the FSV is : c ; g = y ) lyew p ; Assuming the semantic of only given above , tke semantic representation of ( la ) is then : VP\[PcAe ~ . l(x,y)\]v ~ wifeAP(j )
P =
In short , we obtain a reading similar to that of l-tooth , the difference being in the way the FSV is determine cl : by ItOU in our approach  , by means of a semantic definition in Rooth's . 
4 Linguistic applications
In this section , we show that the ItOU approach f ~ wourably compares with I ~  . ooth's and Krifka's an Mysis in that it correctly generates interpretations which these two theories fail to yield  . As we shall see , the main reason for this is that the\[OU approach makes minimal assumptions about the role syntax plays in determining the FSV  . In particular , it relies neither on the use of Quantifier laising  , nor on the assumption of a rule to rule definition of the FSV  . In this way , it avoids some of the pitfalls these theories encounter  . 
ti (: ular , it adequately captures the interaction of focus with VP ellipsis as illustrated by Kratzer's notorious ex~ttnI  ) le:Iordy wer~t to TANGLE'WOO1 ) because you did . 
2 Unification yields another possible value of C ' d  , namely AyXx . l(x,m ) . In what follows , we assume a restriction similar to the DSP's Pr imary Oeeur-ren  ( : e Restriction ( l ) ah'ymple et al ,  1991 ) ' s : the occurrence directly associated with the focus is a primary occurrence and any solution containing a primary occurrence is discarded as linguistically invalid  . 
For instance , * n is a primary occurrence in the equation X x . l(x,,n ) = Gd(m ) so thai ; the solution Gd = AUA . 9: . I(x , 7n ) is invalid . For a formal treatment of l ) SP's Primary Occurrence Restriction and a discussion of how it can be extended to bcus  , see ((? , ardent and Kohlhase ,  1996) . 

We begin by a brief summary of l ~ . ooth's and Krifka's theories and stress the properties relevant for the present discussion  . We then confront the three theories with the data . 
4.1 Two alternative theories of focus
Rooth's Alternative Semanti(:s
Inl ~ , ooth's approach , the FSV is detined by re- ( : ursion on the truth conditional structure which is itself derived from LF  ( i . e . Logical Form , the Government and Binding level of semantic representation  )  . Focus is then seen as introducing a free variable whose value is determined by the current context and is filrthermore constrained to be an element or a subset of the FSV  . For our purpose , the following characteristics are particularly important : ? Given Rooth's definition of the Alternative Set  , a focus operator associates with any tb-cus occurring in its scope  . 
? Any NP may be subject to Quantifier Raising . Importantly , this includes focused NPs . 
? Quantifier Raising may not apply to quanti-tiers occurring in a scope-island  . 
Note that Rooth's approach critica Jly relies on quantifier aising as a means of moving a focused NP out of the scope  , of a focus operator . However this only applies if the focus NP is not eml :  ) edded in a scope island . 
Kritl~t's Structured Meanings
Krifl(a's approach defines a rule-to- . rule semantics which assigns to any syntactic on stituent  , a meaning which can be either a kterm or a structured meaning  , i . e . a tuple oF the form Gd , /") where Gd is Krilka'sI , ' ocus Semantic Value and 1 , " isa(possibly cornl ) Iex )\[ bcus . 
For our purpose , an i in portant characteristic o\['K rifk a . 's approach is the tight syntax/semantic interaction it presupposes  . In particular , the theory requires that a focus operator combines with a syntactic on stituent C whose  , structured se . man-tics C'--(Gd , F ) provides the focus (1 , ') this operator associates with . In other words , the right-adjacent sibling of a \[ b ( : us operator must contain all and only the loci this operator associates with  . 
As wesh Ml later see , some of the data does not seem to square with this assumption  . 
4.2 Multiple Focus Operators
Utterances with multiple locus operators 3 are known pathological cases of focus theory : ( 3 ) a .   ( Jononly ~ read the letters that 5'arah sent to PAUL1  ) b . Jon also ~ onlg tread the letters lhat 5UE . esent to PAUL :, . 
In the given context , the preferred reading of ( 3b ) can be glossed as follows : it is also the case Jbr  5'U  ~ , ) , that J on only , read the lette'r~s shesent to PAULI i . e . , \] on didn't read the letters shc . ~sent to c . g . Peter . In othc ' r words , the preferred reading is that also . 2 associates with b ' Ul'2~ and only j with PAUL : I . 
The HOU analysis
Under the ItOU approach , (3b ) is analysed as l bllows . First , the ' meaning of only lread the letters that SUl ' Sesent to PA  UL1 is derived . ' Fo determine the FSV of the VP , the ground equation ( 4b ) must be solved for which ( de ) is a solution . 
Applying the semantics of only given in section 2 , these , r ~ antics of (4a ) is then as give , , in (4d ) 4 .

433 inherit its FSV fl'om its source clause ( by unification )  . In ( Gardent et al ,  1996) , we show in more detail how the analysis accounts for the interaction of focus with anaphor and definiteness in the case of a particular instantiation of SOEs  , namely corrections . 
Comparison with Rooth and Krifka Under the Alternative Semantics approach  , SOEs are captured as follows . It is assumed that the quantification domain of focus operators is a variable whose value is contextually determined  . 
In the standard case ( i . e . the case where the focus is prosodically marked ) , this quantification domain of focus operators is usually identified with tire FSV of the VP  . However , in the SOE cases , the assumption is that the quantification domain of focus operators is identified with the FSV of the source clause  . Thus in (5a ) , the quantification of only in the second clause is identified with the FSV of the preceding utterance i  . e . the set of properties of the ~ brmlike ing somebody  . 
But now , consider the following example : (6) a . d on only likes MARY . 
b . * No , PETER only likes Sarah.
Clearly , this dialog is ill-formed in that ( 6b ) is no appropriate correction for ( 6a )  . However , under the Alternative Semantics approach , it will not be ruled out since the FSV of ( 6a ) provides an appropriate quantification domain for the focus operator in  ( 6b ) : as required by the semantic of preverbal only , it is a set of properties whose elements can be identified with the VP semantic value Ax  . l(x , rn ) . Hence although Rooth's approach capture some cases of SOEs  , it does not seem to provide an adequate characterisation f the phenomenath and  . 
The Structured Meanings proposal distingui-sires between proper - and quasi-SOEs  . Proper-SOEs involve an exact repetition of some previous linguistic material  , and are analysed as involving an anaphor which is constrained by the restriction that it be a segmental copy of its antecedent  . For instance , the semantics of only likes Mary in ( 5b ) is not determined by the semantics of its parts but is instead identified with the semantic value of its antecedent only likes MARY in  ( 5a )  . In contrast , quasi SOEs only involve semantic equivalence between repeating and repeated material  ( for instance , in a quasi-SOE a repeated element may be pronominalised  )  . Krifk a claims that quasi-SOEs have prosodically marked loci and thus do not raise any specific difficulty  . 
However this theory faces a number of methodological and empirical difficulties  . First , it is noncompositional because tire meaning of the deac-cented material in proper-SOEs is solely defined by the meaning of its antecedent  ( rather than the meaning of its parts )  . Second , the prosodic data is rather unclear : the assumption that quasi-SOE contains a prosodically marked focus is a mootpoint  ( cf . ( Bartels , 1995)) and if it proves to be false , the analysis fails to account for quasi-SOEs . Third , it is counterintuitive in that it handles separately two classes of data  ( i . e . quasi-and proper SOEs ) which naturally belong together . 
Indeed , the HOU approach can be shown to provide a uniform treatment of quasi - and proper- 
SOEs ( cf . ( Gardent et al , 1996)).
5 Formal p roper t ies o f the HOU approach The unification problem can be stated as follows : Given two terms of a logic M and N  , is there a substitution , or , of terms for variables that will make the two terms identical  ( i . e . ~ r ( M )  =  ( r ( N ) )? It is wellknown that for Higher-Order Logic ( e . g . the typed A calculus ) the space of solutions can be infinite and furthermore  , the HOU problem is only semi-decidable so that tile unification algorithm need not terminate for unsolvable problems  . 
Fortunately , in our case we are not interested in general unification  , but we can use the fact that our formulae belong to very restricted syntactic subclasses  , for which much better results are known . In particular , the fact that free variables only occur on the lefthand side of our equations reduces the problem of finding solutions to higher-order matching  , of which decidability has been proven for the subclass of third-order formulae  ( Dowek , 1992) and is conjectured for tile general case . This class ,   ( intuitively allowing only nesting flmctions as arguments up to depth two  ) covers all of our examples in this paper . For a discussion of other subclasses of formulae , where higher-order unification is computationally feasible see  ( Prehofer ,  1994) . 
6 Conclusion
In this paper , we have argued that Higher-Order Unification provides an adequate tool for computing Focus Semantic Values  . To this end , we have considere data which is viewed as a test- -bed for focus theory and shown that  , whilst existing theories either under generate , overgenerate or are methodologically unsatist % ctory  , the ttOU approach yields a simple and transparent analysis  . 
There appear to be two main reasons for this.
434 l , ' irst , the HOU analysis makes minimal assumptions about the role syntax is called to play in determining the I " SV  . lit is detined on a purely semantic level in the sense that unification operates on semantic representations  , and relies neither on quantifier raising , nor on a rule-to-rule definition of the FSV . As we have seen , this type of approach is a plausible way to avoid under generation  . 
Second , the HOU approach permits an equa-tional analysis which can naturally be Nrther constrained by additional equations  . The interest of such an approach was illustrated in our treatment of SOEs which we characterise as involving two phenomena : the computation of an I " SV  , and the resolution of a &' accented anaphor . Not only did we show that this analysis is methodologically and empirically sound  , we also showed that it finds a natural realisation in the equational framework of IIOU : each linguistic phenomena is characterised by some equation  ( s ) and the equations may mutually constrain each other  . For instance , in the case of SOEs , we saw that the equations characterising the de accented anaphor help determine the unidentified FSV of the utterance containing the unmarke  ( I focus . 
Clearly , our approach extends to cases of a ( t-verbial quantification . For lack of space we could not develop the theory here  ; let us just point out that y on F intel's criticism  ( von Fintel , 1995) of semantic approaches to tbcus , also applies to Krifka's Structured Meanings analysis  , but not to the ItOU approach presented here . VonFin-telpoints out that in certain cases of adverbial quantification  , a focus operator associates with an unmarked tbcus and dots not associate with a marked tbcus occurring in its scope-as should be clear fl'om this article  , this is unproblematic for our analysis . 
Of course , there art still many open issues.
First , how does the proposed analysis interact with quantification ? Second  , how does it extend to a dynamic semantics ( e . g . Discourse Representation Theory ) '?  7' Acknowledgments The work reported in this paper was flm ded by the l  ) eutschel , ~ orschungs getneins chaft ( I ) FG ) in Sonderforschungsbereieh S1"B-378 , Project C2 ( MSA) .
