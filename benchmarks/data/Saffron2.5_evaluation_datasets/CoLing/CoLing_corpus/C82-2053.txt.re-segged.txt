AFOR~PROCEDURE FOR BULGARIAN WORD FORM GENERATION 
Elena Paskaleva
Sofia , Bulgaria
The generation procedure proposed aims at the modelling 
of the process of verbal and nominal inflexion in Bulgarian  . 
As in most of the similar morphological models of inflexional languages the procedure uses a comparatively simple mechar ~ ism of description - a comparatively small number of initial objects among which onl  . yone relation ( viz . concatenation ) is assigned ; the transitions generating a separate concrete wordform  ( or class of word forms ) are determined . 
The procedure includes the following linguistic objects -" S =  ( sI , s2 ,  . . . , sn ) -a set of stems in Bulgarian ( these can be the stems of dictionary entries in . a sufficient-ly full dictionary of Bulgarian or the stems of lexical items used by the native speaker in his language behaviour  )  . 
K = ( k l , k2, . . , k ~- where k i is a number of an in-flexional type  . 
G = ( g1'g2''''' gp ) " where g i is grammatical meaning . 
P = < f 2"''' fg ) " where fi is an ending.
T = < tl , t2, . . . , tr)-where ti is the socalled " theme " , i . e . one of the following elements : a thematic vowel in the verbal conjugation  , a form-building suffix in the nominal declension or an extension of the stem inputting an article to some masculine adjectives  . 
A = < al , a2, . . . , as)-where ai is a postpositional article .

D : ( dI , ~, . . . , dw-where di is an inflex lonal suffix .   ( This deviation from the aim of the model to describe only the processes of inflexlon is conditioned by the dual nature of the participle as a part of the verbal paradigm and at the same time following the adjectival declension  . 
This is the reason why , as we shall see below , it is generated in two phases : " verbal stem - ~ stem of a particlple " and " stem of a participle ~ word form of a participle "  . In the first phase elements participate belonging % o the verbal inflexion  ( the thematic vowel typical for the inflexional type of the verbal stem  )  , and in the second , elements belonging to the adjectival declension . 
The elements of Scsm be mapped onto K . This map is many-one . The element correspond lng to s is denoted by k s -Between the elements of G and F  , G and T , G and D , G and A correspondences exist which must be assigned in a table because of special language reasons - the ambiguity of the morphological elements and the different inflexion of one grammatical category  . 
For an initial symbol ( S ) of the generation procedure , some si is accepted accompanied by the corresponding ksl and the set G scG  . By the concatenation of s with t , d , a and f ( the sequence of operations can be followed on the transit-ion network  ) the follow in 6 linguistic objects are obtained : a . as intermediate states of the generation procedure : ST-extended stem  , i . e . " stem+theme " ( sit ~ ) ~ SD-derl vatlonal stem , i . e . " stem ( + eventually a theme ) + word forming suffix " ( sit~dmorsI ~ )  . 
b . as final states of the generation procedure  : 
SP-word form !/- ~
S~-word form with a postposition alart icle  ( SFar )   .

In a most general form , the model for . generation of Bulgarian wordforms may be represented by the following very simple transition network : d The arcs of the network are marked with such an element of the sets T  , D , F and A which is the second argument of the oonoatenation  . 
There being two final states is the result of the agglu-tinative character of the Bu lgarian post positive article  , ad-Joined to an already generated word fo rm  . Deviation from the principles of agglut ination we have in the direct transitions S ~ S ~ and ST ~ SFA  , i . e . the article is adjoined to a stem ( simple or extended )   . Such an adJunction we have in : a ) putt-ing an article to adjectives wh ichinm  . sg . have a zero ending and the article is added to the extended stem  . b ) adding an article to nouns and adjectives ending in masculine withiotized vowel  ( graphically represented by " vowel ? ~" ) or with consonant . In the first case , the violation of the agglunitative character of the article is the ~ esulto f the disregarding of morphonemic dependenc ies in the model gener-ating only strings of letters  ( otherwise we would have a norm-altrans it i on SF ~ S ~  , i . e . repo-J-repo-J-a ) . In the second case , the direct transition S ( ST ) -S ~ is motivated by the linguistic unnaturalness of the resulting solution : the zero ending of the article less mascul in enouns and a ~ Ject-ires  ( final element of the word form ) to be preserved also in the a~ticled form as an intermediate element  ( 6 paT-~~6paT-~-a )   . 

An alternative approach allowing to avoid this unnaturalness is to assume the ident i ty"stem=wordform " in the article- less form  , i . e . the elimination of the zero ending as an e lement of the declension  , which , however , would strongly affect the paradi ~ natio system  . 
The choice of concrete values of t , d , f and a for each s i is determined by the va lue of k i and the elements of Gs assigned in their initial state  . 
This network Jointly represents the models of verbal and nominal inflexion  . Treated separately , the three basic generative procedures are real ized by the following transit-ions : 
Finite forms
II . I~3
Par Siclples
I . A . I ~4! B . 4 ~3 or 4~3-5 or 4-2~5 II . A . I-2~4; B . 4 ~3 or 4~3-5 or 4~2-5

I . I~2-3 or I~2-3-5
If . I-3 or I~3~5
III . I~3 or 1~5
Adjectives
I ~1-3 or 1-3-5
II . 1-3 or I~2 ~5
III . I~3 or 1-5
The choice of procedures I , II or III within the frame-work of the bas ic generation procedures is determined by the e lements of Gs and the value of ki in the in i tial state  , The existence of disjunction in procedures I  , II and III for nominal generation is condi tioned by the existence or absence of -  220 -an " article form " value among the e lements of Gs  . The trans-itions A and B of the generating procedure for partiol plem are executed sequentially  .
