Current practical machine translation systems ( MT , in short ) , which are designed to deal with a huge amount of document  , are general \] y structure-bound . 
That is , the translation process is done based on ti leanalysis and transformation of the structure of source sentence  , not on the understanding and paraphrasing of the meaning of that  . But each language has its own : ~ yntactic and semantic idiosyncrasy  , and on this account , without understanding the total meaning of source sentences it is often difficult for MT to bridge properly the idiosyncratic gap between source ~ and target-language  . A somewhat new method called " Cross Translation Test  ( CTT , in short ) " is presented that reveals the detail of idiosyncratic gap  ( IG , in short ) together with the so-so satisfiable possibility of MT  . It is also mentioned the usefulness olf sublanguage approach to reducing the IC between source - and target-language  . 
i . Introduct : ion
The majo J :\[ ty of the current practical machine translation system  ( MT , in short ) ( See\[Nagao1985\] and\[Slocum11 . 985\] for a good survey . ) are structure-bound in tile sense that al \] the target sentences  ( i . e . 
translated , ~ entences ) are composed only from the syntactic st:ructure of the source sentences  , not from the meaning understanding of those . Though almost all tile MT are utilizing some semantic devices such as semantic feature agreement checkers  , semantic filters ant l preference semantics ( See\[Wilks1975\] for example . ) which are serving as syntactic structural disambiguation  , they still remain Jnstructure-hound approaches far from tile total \[ meaning understanding approaches  . 
\]? he structure-bound MT has a lot of advantageous features among which the easiness of formalizing translation process  , that is , writing translation rules and the uniformity of lexicon description a revital from the practical standpoint that it must transact a huge vocabulary and \] numerable kinds of sentence patterns  . 
On the other hand , the structure-bound MT has the inewttable limitation on the treatment of lingu : is tic idiosyncrasy originated from the different way of " thinking  . 
In this paper , first of all , we will sketch out the typical language modeling techniques on which the structure-bound MT  ( = current practical machine translation systems ) are constructed . Secondly , we will examine the difference between the principal mechanism of machine translation and that of human translation irom the viewpoint of the language understanding a bi\]ity  , l ' hirdly , we will illustrate the structural idiosyncratic gap  ( IG , in short ) by comparing the sample sentences in English and that in  , lapanese . These sentences are sharing the same reCall-ing . This comparison will be made by a somewhat new method which we call " Cross Translation Test  ( CTT , in short ) " , which will cventual \] y reveal the various IGs that have origins in the differences of culture  , i . e . , the way of thinking or the way of representing concepts  . But at " the same Lime , CTT wiJl give some encouraging evidence that the principal technologies of today's not-yet -completed structure-bound HTs have the potentia \ ] for producing barely acceptable translation  , if the source language sentences are taken from tile documents of less equivocations or are appropriately rewritten  . Finally , we will briefly comment on the sub\]anguage to control or normalize source sentences as the promising and practical approaches to overcoming the IGs  . 
2. Model in ~ of Natural Lan ~
Modeling natural , language sentences is , needless to say , very essential to all kinds of natural language processing systems inclusive of machine translation systems  . The aim of mode \] ing : is to reduce the superficia \] complexity and variety of the sentence form  , so as to reveal the ind well : Lug structure which is indispensable for computer systems to analyze  , to transform or to generate sentia \] . representations . 
So far various modeling techniques are proposed ( See for example\[Winograd1 . 983\] . ) among which the two , tile dependency structure modeling ( Figurel ) and the phrase structure modeling ( Figure 2 ) are important . The former associated with semantic cole labeling such as case marker assignment is indispensable to analyze and generate Japanese sentence strueture  ( See for example \] N it , a , et al .  1984\] . ) , and the latter associated with syntactic rote labeling such as governor-dependent assignment  , head-com-plement assignment , or mother-daughter assignment ( See for example \[ Nitta , et el .  1982\] . ) is essential to analyze and generate English sentences  .

" To what extent should  ( or can ) we treat semantics of sentences ?" is also very crucial to the decision for selecting nr designing tile linguistic model for that the majority of the current " practical " machine translation systems  ( MT , in short ) are structure-bound or syntax-oriented , though almost all of them claim that they are semantics-directed  . Semantics are used only for disambiguation and booster in various syntactic processes  , but not used for the central engine for transformation  , generation and of course not for paragraph understanding  ( See\[Slocum 1985 , pp .   14   ~16\] for a good survey and discussion on this problem ; and see also \[ Nitta , et al1982\] for the discussion on a typical ( classical ) structure-bound translation mechanism , i . e , local rearrangement method ) . Here " practical " means " of very largescale commercial systems " or " of the daily usage by open users "  , but neither " of small scale laboratory systems " nor " of the theory-oriented experimental systems  "  . For structure-bound machine translation systems , both the dependency structure modeling and the phrase structure modeling are very fundamental technical tools  .

Figure 2 . Example of Phrase Structure Modeling The semantic network medeling  , which is recently regarded as an essential tool for semantic processing for natural languages  ( See for examples \[ SimmOns1984\] . ) , might also be viewed as a variation of dependency modeling  . However modeling problems are not discussed further here  . Comparing Figure 1 and Figure 2 , note that the dependency structure modeling is more semantics-oriented  , logical and abstract , in the sense of having some distance from surface word sequences  . 
3 . Machine Translation vs . lluman Translation Today's practical machine translation systems  ( MT , in short )   ( See for example \[ Nagao 1985\] and \[ Slocum 1985\]  . ) are essentially structure-bound \] iteraltype . 
The reasons for this somewhat extreme judgement are as follows:  ( i ) The process of MT is always under the strong control of the structural information extracted from source sentences  ; (2) In all the target sentences produced by MT , we can easily detect the traces of wording and phrasing of the source sentences  ;   ( 3 ) MT is quite in different to whether or not the output translation is preserving the proper meaning of the original sentence  , and what is worse , MT is incapable of judging whether or not ;   ( 4 ) MT is quite poor at the extrasentential information such as situational information  , world knowledge and common sense which give a very powerful command of language comprehension  . 
Now let us see Figure 3 . This rather over simplified figure illustrates the typical process of JapaneseEnglish structure -bound machine translation  . 
Here the analysis and transformation phase are based on the dependency structure modeling  ( cf . Figurei ) and the generation phase is based on the phrase structure modeling  ( cf . Figure 2) ( For further details , see for example \[ Nitta , et al1984\] . ) . 
This figure reveals that all the process is bound by the grammatical structure of the source sentence  , but not by the meaning of that .

Figure 3 . Simplified Sketch of Machine Translation Process Thus  , the MT can easily perform the literal syntax -directed translation such as ' from  ( Jl ) into ( E'I ) '  ( cf . Figurei ) . But it is very very difficult for MT to produce natural translation which reflects the idiosyncrasy of target language  ) pre--serving the original meaning .   ( El ) is an example of a natural translation of ( J 1 )  . In order for MT to produce this ( El ) from ( Jl )  , it may have to invoke a somewhat sophisticated heuristic rule  . In Figure 3, the heuristic rule , HR(KK , KS, . . . ) , can suces s-fully indicate the change of predicate which may improve the treatment for the idiosyncrasy of target sentence  . 
But generally .   , the treatment of idiosyncratic gap ( IG , in short ) such as ' that between ( Jl ) and ( El ) ' possible to find universal grarmnatical rules to manipulate this kind of gaps  ,   . and what is worse , the appropriake heuristic rules are not always found successfully  . 
On the other hand , tile human translation ( HT , in short ) is essentially semantics-oriented type or meaning understanding type  . 3 ? he reasons for this judgement are as follows : ( i ) HT is free from the structure , wording and phrasing of a source sentence ;   ( 2 ) liT can " create " ( rather than " translate " ) freely a target sentence from something like an image  ( Hagram obtained froln a source sentence ( F ~ gure 4 )  ; ( Of course the exact structnre of th\] . q image diagram is not yet known ) ;   ( 3 ) IT often refer stile extralinguistic knowledgef ~uch as the common sense and the culture  ; (4) Thus , tIT cart overcome the idiosyncrat:ic gaps ( \]G ) freely and unconsciously .

Fiqure 4 . Human \]' ra . slation Process meaning but each of which be \] . ongs to different language . The reason for comparing tile two sentences i s that we cannot : examine the linguistic idiosyncrasy itself  . Because , currently , we cannot fix the one abstract neutral meaning without using something like the image diagram  ( cf . Figure 4) which is not yet elucidated . 
In order to examine tl midio syncratic gap , we have devised the practical method named " Cross Translation Test  ( CTT , in short ) . " The outline of
CTT is as follows : \] first , take an appropriate well-written sample sentence written in one language  , say English ; Let E denote this sample sentence ; Secondly , selector make the proper free translation of E in the other \]  . anguage , say Japanese ;\] , et J denote this proper free translation ; J must preserve tile orlginal meaning of E properly  ; At the same time , make a literal Lrans \] . tion of F , in the same language that , \] is written in ; Let J ' denote this literal translation ; Lastly , make a Literal translation of J in the same language  . that E is written in ; Let E ' denote tM . sliteral translation . 
iI er e , the " literal " translation means the translation that :\[  . s preserving the wording , phras:ing and various senteatial structure of the original  ( source ) sentence as much as possible . Then , eventually we may be able to define ( a ~ dexamine ) the idiosyncratic gap ,  \] . C , by Figure 5 .

Fiyure 5 . Illustrative Definitioil of Idiosyncratic Gap Now  , note that we ( : all assume there \] at Jonshil )   , i , '\]\] e=MT , and \]\]' T-&\]HT , where "-"" deno Les " near\]y equal " or " bea\] . most equivalent to " . Namely , we can assume that the \] iter a \] L rans lat J on , IL l ' , which i . s preserving the wording , phrasing and structure of tile source sentence , Js almost e-qu:\[va\] . ent to the idealized competence of today's practical structure-bonnd machine trans\]ation  , MT . Tim rationale of this assumption has already been discussed in Section  3  . 
? n this section , let us examine the idiosyncratic gaps between the two sentences which share the same In this paper  , the litera \] trans\]ation ,  \] , T (" MT ) , is performed by tracing the \[ ) roee dural steps of a virtual machine translation system  ( VMTS ) theoretical-ly . \]1 ere , the VMTS is a certain hypothetical system machine translation systems  , but which models the general properties of today 's practical structure-bound machine translation systems  . 
Now let us observe the gap , IG , by applying CTT to various sample sentences . First , let us take an example with large gaps . 
Kokkyo-nonagaltonnent-wonuken~-toyuki-gunide -atta  . 
\[ of borderl\[Iongl\[tunnell ( after passing through l\[snow country lI was l ?\ [ Lit  . After passing through the long border runnel , it was the snow country . \] + ( E ' 3 ) ? Tile train came out of the long tunnel into the snow country  .   ( E3 ) Ressha-wanagaltonnenl-w of luke-reytlki-guni-ni de-ta  . 
(J3 ) is taken from the very famous novel " Yuki-guni " written by Yasunari Kawabata  , and ( E3 ) is taken from the also famous translation by Seidensticker  . 
(E'3 ) : is the slight modification of \[ Nakamura 1973 , p . 27\] and ( J'3) is taken from the same hook . In ( E3 ) the new word " the train\[ressha\]"is supplemented according to the situational understanding of the paragraph including  ( J 3 ) which may , currently , be possible only for HT . 
(J3 ) is a very typical Japanese sentence possessing the interesting idiosyncrasy  , i . e . , ( J3) has no superficial subject . But in ( J 3 ) some definite subject is surely recognized , though unwritten . That is " the eyes of the story teller " , or rather " the eyes of the reader who has already joined the travel to the snow country by the train "  . So the actual meaning of ( J 3 ) can be explained as follows : After I ( = the reader who is now experiencing the imaginary travel  ) passed through the long border tunnel by the train  , it was the snow country tha ~ I encountered . 
Thus ( J 3 ) is very successful in recalling the fresh and vivid impression of seeing  ( also feeling and smelling ) suddenly the snow country to the readers . 
(J3 ) has a poetic feeling and aly ric appeal in its neat and concise style  . 
But the English sentence such as ( E3 ) requires the concrete , clearly written subject , " the train\[=res-sha \]" in this case , and this concrete subject requires the verb , " came " , and again this verb requires the two locative adverbial phrases  , " out of the long tunnel " and " into the snow country "  . Thus , the original phrase " yuki-guni de-atta . \ [= it was the snow country . \]" in(J3) has completely disappeared in ( E3) , but the new adverbial phrase " into the snow country\[=yuki-guni-ni \]" appears instead  . These drastic changes are made under the strong influence of linguistic idiosyncrasy  , and , at the same time , with the effort to preserve the original poetic meaning as much as possible  . 
Consequently , these changes have invoked a large distant gap , IG between ( J3) and ( E3) . But this gap is indispensable for this translation from  ( J 3 ) into ( E3 )  , 
HT:(J3) ?( E3) , where ,  \] ( J 3 )  -  ( E3 ) I ~ l ( E3 )  -  ( E3 ) I ~ ~ G = large . 
One more comment . Note that as a result of this large gap , the literal translation from ( J3) into ( E'3) , 
LT : ( J3) ?( E'3) where , J ( J3 )  -  ( E ' 3 ) J~J ( E'3 )  -  ( E ' 3 ) I = 0 has failed to preserve the original meaning , i . e . ,  ( E ' 3 ) is an unacceptable translation which is misleading  . Because ( E ' 3 ) can be interpreted as : After something ( = it ) finished passing through the long border tunnel , something became ( = changed into ) the snow country . 
However , it is not always the case with idiosyncratic gaps  . Lastly , let us now observe the somewhat encouraging example favorable for struc-ture-bound machine translation  , MT ("- LT) . In the following quadruplet , the gap is not so small but the gapless translation  , i . e ~, LT (' MT ) is acceptable . The following sample sentence ( E4) , is the news line taken from \[ News week , January 18 ,  1982 , p . 45\] .

For tile reason of space limitation we have omitted the comments to this example  . 
Let us see one more example sentence ( iS ) in order to confirm that the structure-bound MT , which lacks the ability to understand the meaning of source sentences  , can produce the barely passable translation , and to try to search for the reason for this . 
( as ) 1~o0'5) mila
I saw\[ ( E5 ) is one of the sample sentences in \[ Wilks 1975\] where anaphora and references are discussed as the important elements of sentence understanding  . 
As is pointed out by Wilks , a certain extent of understanding is necessary to solve the anaphora and reference problem of the sentence  ( E5 )  , that is , whether " them " refers " the soldiers " or " the women "  . 
And actually , the structure-bound MT , which cannot understand the meaning of " fired . at " and " fall " , may translate " them " into " kare-ra " being in differ-"kare-ra " denot:es the pronoun of \] male  , third person , plural \] , and " kanojo-ra " denote stile pronoun of\[ female  , third person , plural \] , so ( , 7'5) \] . s somewhat misleading translation . Nevertheless , human ( i . e . 
almost all thc ~ Japanese readers ) can sure \] . y understand the sentence ( J '5) correctly ; that is , they can understand that " kare-ra " ( = " them " ) is referring " on-na-tachi" ( = " the women " ) uot " heishi-tachi" ( = " the soldie-rs " )  . The reason of this is that the human's brain can understand lille  , leaning of the sentence ( J ' 5 ) with the support of the colm nonsense like :
X fires at Y + Y will severly wounded + Y will fall and die  , which functions as the compensator for the anaphora and references  . 
The above example shows that the lack of the anaphoricability in structure-bound MT may sometimes be compensated by the human-side  , which is the encouraging fact for MT . 
So far the point we are trying to make clear is that even IG-neglecting MT  ( = structure-bomld machine translation systems ) can generate target sentences that convey the correct meaning of source sentences  , when tlre\] . att : er are written J . n simple , logical , structures . 
5. Conclusions
This paper has dealt with the \] . imitations and potentials of structure-bound machine translation  ( MT ) from the standpoint of the idiosyncratic gaps ( IG ) that exist between Japanese and \]' ; nglish . Tile conmmrcial machine translation system ( MT ) curreut \] . y on the market : are inept at handling riGs ince they are still not capable of unders t and ing then leaning of sentences l : i  . ko human translators can , and are thns bound by the , qyntactic structures of the source sentences . This was pointed out by applying the Cross Translation Test  ( CTT ) to several sample sentences , which brought the performance limitations of structure-bound mach : i  . netranslation into sharp relief . But the CTT applications also showed that if the source language sentence Js simple  , logical and contains few ambiguities , today's fG-neglect Jng machine translation systems are capable of generating acceptable target sentences  , sentences that preserve the meaning of the original  ( source ) sentences at rd can be understood . 
However ~ source sentences are not always simple , logical and unambiguous . Therefore , to improve the performance of machine trans\ ] ation systems it will be necessary to develop technology and techniques aimed at rewriting  . ' ; ource sentences prior to inputting them into systems  , and at formalizing ( norma \] izing ) and control . ling source sentence preparation . One move in this direction in recent years has had to do with tile source language itself  . Research has been steadily advancing in the area of Sub\]  . anguage Theory . Sublanguages are more regulated and controlled than everyday humml languages  , and therefore make it easier to create simple , logical sentences that are re\] . ative-lyfree of ambiguities . Some examples of sublanguage theories currently under study are " sublanguage "\ [ Kittredge and Lehrberger  1982\]~"controlled language "\[ Nagao \] . 9 8311 and " normalized language "\ [ Yoshida \]984\]  . 
The aim of these sublanguage theories is to assign certain rules arld restrict : lensto\]:he everyday human \] anguage a we use to trausmXt and explain information  , improving the accuracy of parsing operations necessary \] for nlach J  . ne process J . ng ~ audenhancing human understanding . Some examples of the \] . ingnJstic rules and restrictions envisioned by the sublanguage theories are rules governing the creation of lexicons \ [ Kigtredge and Lehrberger  1982\]  , rules governing the use of function words related to the log : tca\]construction of sentences\[ Yoshida  1984\] and ru\]es governirlg the expression of s on \ ] cut\]el dependencies\[Nagao  1  . 983\]  .
