2.2 Explanation
Now let us resume solving the problem . The distribution of grammaticality over ( 1 ) through ( 5 ) is accounted for by assuming the h ) llowing constraints on the syntactic structure of

(6 ) Passing of a dislocated element is permitted only between the mother and the head daughter or between them other and the complement daughter  .  '  ( 7 ) Passing of a dislocated element and binding of another cannot take place simultaneously in one local tree  . 
In (1), every passing obeys this constraint . For instance , passing the dislocated element bound by ' Who /' into  $1 and passing it into S , are both O . K . , because S ~ is the cmnplement of ' know ' and S ~ is the complement of ' that '  ( whether you might employ a transformational c count or such theories as GPSG  , 
HPSG , and LFG.).
However , (2) violates (6) and (7) First , the dislocated element bound by ' What /' is passed into  $2  , which is not a complement but an adjunct of ' girl '  ; i . e . , a violation of (6) Second , the same dislocated element is passed into VP2 where another dislocated element gets bound by ' who '  , ending up with a violation of (7) . Similarly in (3) and (4) , passing and binding cooccur at the local trees introducing ' who ' and ' whatj '  , respectively , violating (7) . (5) is blocked by (7) , because of the passing into the subject ' a story about es '  ; i . e . , the specifier of INFL ( in the transformational ccount ) or of VP ( in theories like GPSG , etc . ) . 
2.3 Cognitive Aspects of Constraints
The explanations about such phenomena proposed in contemporary linguistic inquiries  , especialiy the accounts in terms of barriers / Chomsky  1986/  , are roughly regarded as formalizations of the idea sketched above  . This line of reasoning is in turn attributed to processing terms  , when viewed from the standpoint of cognitive science  . The background intuition is that varies from one type of operation to another  , and that there is an upper bound on the total processing load for constituting one branching local tree  . On account of this , the reason why passing tend to be blocked under the certain sorts of circumstances would be that it is an expensive operation  a11d thus is hard to perform together with other expensive operation such as adjunction or binding  . .
The processing load for carrying out various syntactic operations could be further reduced to more fundamentals pects of information processing  . Consider , for instance , why specification and adjnnction should be harder than cornplement at ~ on  . 
q ' he reason seems to be that complementation is lexical \] y litensed and is head-initial  ( the current discussion is limited to English )  ; i . e . , the occurrence of a complement licensed by the lexical entry of its head and thus is predicted from the occurrence of the preceding head  . On the other hand , the occurrence of a specifier or of an adjunct is harder to predict  , because the former ( though lexically licensed ) precedes its head and the latter is not lexically licensed by the head  . Passing and binding of dislocated elements are also considered to be nonlexical operations  , though there are a few exceptions involving , for example , so called tough adjectives , as indicated by the following sentence . 
(8 ) \[ Which violin\]/is\[this sonata\]j\[Ap easy to playe j on q\]?The difference between  ( 4 ) and ( 8 ) is that the binding of the dislocated element carrying index j is lexically licensed in the latter but not in the former  . In (8) , the binding in effect occurs at the local tree expanding AP  , where this binding is sanctioned by the \] exical entry of ' easy '  . This is why (8) is grammatical despite (7); i . e . , the lexically licensed binding is not an expensive operation  , so that it does not play the same role as ordinary binding would play in regard of  ( 7 )  . 
Note that the processing load concerning the examples we have discussed so far is defined within a single sentence structure rather than by taking structural ambiguity into account  . 
This is why the traditional syntactic approaches are able to capture some of such aspects of language  ; in principle , properties of a single structure can be characterized in static terms  . 
3 Dynamic Account
However , the above static approach cannot by itself explain some UBD phenomena  , especially socalled the Complex NP Constraint ( originally termed by Ross/Ross 1967/ ) observed in the examples that follow . 
(9 ) * Who ido you believe\[ NPl\[mp2the claim \]\ [ gs that\[ss she loves q\]\]\]? ( 10 ) * What/did you propose a plan\[vP to buyel\ ] ? In  ( 9 )  , Sa is the complement of ' claim ' . Hence the dislocated element , bound by ' Who /' should be permitted to be passed into Sa without violating  ( 6 )  . Similarly , VP ( or CP , in the traus-formational account ) in ( 10 ) is regarded as the eomplelnent of ' plan ' , so that the dislocated element bound by ' What /' should be able to pass through  , (6) aud (7) being respected . Hence the static account in the previous section provides no reason why these example should be ungrammatical  . It is considered because of essentially the same sort of difficulty that Chomsky/Chomsky  1986/ leaves unexplained this type of island effect . 
3 ol A Model of Language Processing
Now then let us turn to dymunic aspects of language processing  , and consider what kind of syntactic structures a human bearer should have t milt and tentatiw dy maintains when ' that ' in  ( 9 ) is encountered . As a basis for this investigatiou , we adopt the following postulates about ha , nan language processing . 
(\[1) t* . When ; ~ word is encountered , it is attached to stcuc . .
tures previously built , giving rise to new structures . 
ii ; ven when several possible wa ? ~ of attachment are acknowledged  , the processing is sotpost poned , but a ~ many new structures corresponding to those ways o : ! attachment are made in parallel  . 
b . ' lJ ' here is a limitation on the size of the memory for  . ~toring these structures , and thus it is impossible to retain all the structures potentially sanctioned  . Only strtn ; tures activated strongly enough can survive the competition lbrseats in the limited memory  . 
From(ll ) plus some minor hypotheses , a general processing model %11o '?% which describes both sentence comprehension and generation  . This model postulates that . just after any word a is encoun Lered , every maximal structure of the sentence cur , rently hypothesized in mind should look at ) t ) roximately like the part enclosed within the curve in  ( :12 )  . 
(12) j ; 2 itereew ; rybranching local tree is assumed to be binary , without los ~ of generality . AI and , 5' may be identical , and the shortter memory contains the information about Ai  , Bi(1_<i<d) , and A , pins the inEormat in about the configura . .
lion of these categories relative to each other . Note that , as a whole , enough information is thus retained to control the gram-  . 
maticality ot the way the foregoing context fits the rest of the sentmme  ; Those categories are the points on which the currently hypothesized structure has contacts with the still unknown part of the  sente0ce  . 
Strictly speaking ~ the picture shown in ( 12 ) should he looked upon merely as a first order approximation of the reality  . Thatia , the part of the sentence struct n reen closed in tlte curve might contain some variable parts  , rather than being totally definite . Suppose , \[ o ; r instance , that a sentence begins wit , ha * ~ oun phrase say " this man ' . T i t ( ; entire tree structure of this NP should he completed as sool ~ as ' m ~  , on ' is encountered , but its grammatical case would not be uniquely determined yet  , he-cause the senteuce as a whole might turn out to be so inething like " l'hisn-tP  , n , I don't know ' , rather than " Fhisman is crazy ' ; The initiM NP is accusative in the former sentence  , and nonfina-tive in the latter . In the following discussion , however , we shall merely exploit very rough properties of the model  , so that such an inaccuracy is considered irrelevant  . Readers are referred tollasida/liasida 1985/for how this model is ohtained and what it predicts , wt fich the limited space of the current article fails to accommodate  . 
3? 2 Explarm tion 1, etustm ' nt > ack to (9) . According to this model , when % hat'is encountered while ( 9 ) is being comprehended , the right-branching struct n recovering the string from'Whoi'through'claim'has been nearly completed  ; rod the most active structure around ' that ' should look like  ( 13 )  . Ilerearise two pieces of indepen-(13) NP1
NP2$3 the claim ( , Oraldent two way ambiguity , as listed below , concerning how this structure might potentially grow  . 
(14) a . " i ' hat ' is a relative tronoun.
h.'That'is a conjunction.
(115) a.Ss contains a gap bound by ' What /'.
h.~a does not contain a gap bound by ' What /'.
The combination of (14 a , b ) and ( \]5 a , b ) gives rise to local struc-i , m ' alambiguity across four hypotheses : ( l4a ~\[5a )  , (14 a&l5 b ) , ( Hb&lSa ) , a , ~ d(4 b~lSb) . 
Since (:16) , a ~ instantiation of (14a & 15b ) , is clearly O . K . , what we have to show is that out of these ff~nr hypotheses just  ( lda&15 b ) and ( 14 b&15 b ) entert\] , e grammar to be ~ t cquired . 
(I6) Who idid you tell ci the I ' awt . hatd hekH (' . wq~?ltence now let us consider why ( Ida & l5 a ) a ~ arl ( 14 b&l Sa ) are rejected , We pay attention to the beh~t vior of dislocated elements  , as we did in the stath : approach , q ' wo dislocated dements ar0 relevan to the grammatical status of ( 9 )  . The first one , which is bound by q ; hat ' , corresponds to the possibility (14a ) . Let us refer to this as a from now on . The other , the one bound by ' Whati ' , is present iff (15a ) obtains . We shall cal I it The status of ( 14 a&15 a ) is parallel to ( 1 )  . (7) rules out this possibility immediately , because it postulates that the local tree expanding S-aaccommodates both the binding of cv by ' that ' and the passing offl into Sa  . As for (14b&15a ) , however , (7) as it is fails to work . 
We need some preparation before tackling why ( 14 b&l Sa ) is rejected . (7) says that two distinct dislocated elements , one passed and the other bound , cannot simultaneously take part in one local tree  . As mentioned above , the cognitive-scientific motivation for the constraints  ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) is that the mental granmtar does not admit a rule whose execution accompanies too severe processing load  . On account of this motivation ,   ( 7 ) is natnrally generalized simply by taking off the presupposition that only an operation in one local tree is talked about  . That ( 17 ) The grammar cannot accommodate any rule which manipulates two distinct dislocated elements in two different manners  , binding the one and passing the other , at the same time ( irrespective of whether or not the two dislocated elements are processed in the same local tree of the same coherent structure of a sentence  )  . 
The essential difference between ( 7 ) and ( 17 ) is that the latter can mention a rule which simultaneously handles several hypothetical structures of the same sentence  ; i . e . , a rule which explicitly deals with a local structural ambiguity  . That is , (17) does , but (7) does not , reject such a rule if it binds a dislocated element in a sentence structure and at the same time passes another dislocated element in another structure  , the two structures corresponding to two different hypotheses  . 
Now let us return to (14b ~; 15a) . (14 a&15 a ) having been ruled out , we are now left with three possibilities : ( 14 a & lhb )  , (14b&15a ) and (14b & lhb) . The former two give rise to a and /5 , respectively , and hence these dislocate dements how up in the multiple structure representing the disjunction of these possibilities  ; i . e . , the structure subsuming in parallel the three structnres instantiating those possibilities  . According to the model introduced above , these two dislocated elements are simultaneously manipulated  , one bound and the other passed . 
That is , tile local tree expanding Sa(i . e . , the local tree in which the binding of c ~ and passing offl are both supposed to take place  ) is built at the same time in all the three possible lines of processing  . \]' his is understood by comparing (13) with . the next state (18) . When yougo from (13) to (18) , the local tree expanding Sa is completed . 
(18) NP1 the claim CompSs//t/\]that /

I the
According to (17) , therefore , the rule of syntax in charge of this case must reject the possibility of the existence of either or fl  ; otherwise these two dislocated elements would be manipulated  ( bound and passed ) simultaneously here . Now note that a is chronologically newer than ft . What psychologists call the recency effect , consequently , tells us that a ( hence ( 14 a&15 b ) ) should sm'vive , defeating fl and thus rendering (9) ungrammatical . 
The account of the ungrammaticality of ( 10 ) is the same except that the potential binder , which is the counterpart of ' that ' in (9) , is hidden in ' plan ' and thus is not over there . This time a is the dislocated element bound by this binder  , and the one bound by ' Whati' . 
Note that this explanation concerns language acquisition by children  , rather than language use by adults . It must concern the acquisition stage ; otherwise what we have shown would not be the ungrammaticality of  ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) but merely the diffi-to language acquisition , because the ambiguity pertaining to ( 14 ) and ( 15 ) occm's every time a structure like ( 13 ) is encountered , so that its disambiguation can be fixated as a part of the grammar of English to be acquired  . 
3  . 3 Ru les Hand l ing Loca l Ambigu i ty Further discussion are in order here about the generalized constraint  ( 17 ) and its role in the above explanation . First , the above discussion postulates that the grammar ules are sensitive to structural ambiguity such as  ( 14 ) and ( \] . 5) about (9) , in the sense that some rules of syntax work on multiple structures  , and thus are in charge of disambiguation . Here one might worry which types of ambiguity are handled by the grammar  , and which are handled metagrammatically . Note very sort : of ambiguity is visible to the grammar  , as is demonstrated by the following example , which is grammatical . 
(19) Who idid you tell them an \[~4 that Is , she loves ?/\]\]? The local ambiguity arising here appears irr filar to that of  ( 9 )  . More precisely , a four-way local ambiguity arises at ~ that ' , as a combination of two pieces of independent two -way ambiguity  , one concerning whether ' that ' is a relative pronoun or a conjunction  , and the other whether or not $4 contains a gap bound by ' Who /' , just as in (9) . : An outstanding difference between (9) and (19) , however , is that the ambiguity in the latter case involves two different hypothetical constituent structures that follow  . 
(20 ) \[vp\[vl tell\[Npl the man \]\] [ g thatSs\]\ ]   ( 21 ) \[G tell\[ NP2\[Nplthe man \]\ [ g thatSs\]\]\]To children learning UBD constructions  , both of these constituent structure should appear ambiguous about whether or not S~contains a gap bound by ' Whoi '  . 
This ambiguity , unlike the one in (9) , is considered invisible to the grammar , presumably because of the above ditference . 
That is , if any single rule were sensitive to this ambiguity  ,   ( 19 ) should be rendered ungrammatical for the same reason why  ( 9 ) is so , because in ( 19 ) a dislocated element would be bound by ' that ' and another dislocated element would be passed into  $4 simultaneously . To make sure that the binding and the passing should be simultaneous here  , notice that the local tree expanding S~is completed simultaneously in the two pairs of hypotheses corresponding respectively to  ( 20 ) and ( 21 )  . Itence the binding by ' that ' and the passing into Ss must take place simultaneously  . 
Seemingly the reason why the grammar is not sensitive to this type of local ambiguity is that the four possibilities are not coherent enough  , in the sense that they are distributed across the two distinct constituent structures as mentioned above  . It appears that the disambiguation falocal structural ambiguity is acquired as a part of the grammar only if the structures  ( or hypotheses ) constituting that ambiguity are coherent enough with each other  . Comparing (19) with (9) and (10) , one might thus posit the following constraint . 
(22 ) A local structural ambiguity is handled within the grammar only if the parallel structures involved thereins h are the same constituent structure  . 
As for (9) , for instance , besides ( 13 ) there could of course be several other structural possibilities  , but they are simply it- . 
relevant othe acquMtion process discussed above , rather than : ~ ystem at , ica . llyabandoned like (14a&15a ) and (14b&15a ) . We would then be able to disregard any interaction across distinct constituent structures when considering the competence grammar  . 
There are ~ , ; least two more supports to constraint (22) . 
l " irst ,   ( 22 ) f ) llows from the following more fundament M constraint  . 
(23) There is a severe limit , outhesize of the structure which one rule of syntax can refer to at once  . 
Anarn bigui'i ; y within one constituent structure tends to full within this limit  , because the parallel structures involw ' . d therein share most i ; f the storage with each other . An ambiguity across several con : ~( . ituenl , structures , howc'ver , wouht more often run out of this limit , since , the rate of the shared memory is smldler . 
Note that (2a ) claims , after all , nothing more than the lira \] ta-t . ion on the complexity of mentally feasible rules . 
Another reason h ) r h o l d i n g ( 22 ) is based on how ~ stuhborn ' an ambiguity is . Asmenl ; ioned earlier , patterns like (9) and (10) constantly ; ~ c company the local ambiguity like (14) plus (15) . In contrast , patterns like (19) are often less ambiguous , as shown in tile example below . 
(24 ) Who idid you tell him\[g that she lovesell ? In this s  . mtence , the possibilit ; y of ' that ' being a relatiw ~ pronoun i , svery unplausible , the local ambiguity being greatly w . duced ; we are left with the aml ) iguity of whether or not tit (  ; dislocai , ed element bound by ' Who i ' is coutaiiled in $6 . Ill summary , the ambiguity in (9) and (\]0) is robust , while that in (19) is fragile . An ambiguity within a single constituent structure tends I  ; obe robust , tn  comparison , an ambiguity encompass . -ing several different constituent structnres tends to be fragile  , because the relationship ( as for which is more plausible than which , etc . ) between those eonstituent structures varies from case to case  , depending on timinternal details of the relevanl  ; constituents context , and so on . The corresponding relation in lheformer tgpc of aml  ) iguity , oiltheol , her hand , is more constant . Robu : ; t ambiguity is visible to the grammar , while fragile one is not ; Some rules of syntax handle tile former , while the latter is trea , edmetagrammatically . 
3 04 Cerman Case '\] ~ he following pair of German examples might fall out of our dynamic account on  ( 9 ) and ( 10 )  . 
(25) We niglauben Sic , dabereiliebl ; ?(26) * Wen/glauben Siedie Behauptung , duffereiliebt ? (25) and (2fi ) are ( . lerman counterparts of (1) and (9), respectively . Note that the direct translation between English and Cerman pre::erves grammaticality across these pairs of examples  . 
Since '\] ~ ehauptung ' ix of the feminine geuder rather than neuter  , ~ daff should not be confused with a relative pronoun  , namely ' die ' or ~ der ' , whose antecedent is ' Behanptuug ' ; The relative proi ) oun pronounced the same as ' daft'is'das ' , which is of I ; heneul , ergender and the nominative or accusative case . 
So it appears that in the case of ( 26 ) children learning German should face no ambiguity like  (  14  )  . Our current approach , which is essentially based on local ambiguity , hence seems unable , o account for the grammatical status of (26) . 
In reality , however , the above example does not contradicl ; our approach ; i . e . , constraint (17) . Ambiguity parallel to (14) arises in fact , and t , herelbre the ungranimaticality of ( 26 ) is predicted by ( 17 )  . To children learning 1 . JBI ) construction of German ,   ( 26 ) accompanies the same sort of local ambiguity as ( 9 ) does , because they acquire the roughfl ' a mework of UBD construc  (  . ioubefore the gender system is properly installed into tile morphology of relative pronouns  . According to Mills/Mills\]986/ , when children begin to use rela . tive clauses around the age of 3 , relative pronouns in the relative constructions they make a  . weither simply ommited or le~cking iu forulatiou about the geunler  ( and the case , too ) .  \] ) ' or eXaml ) le: ( 27 ) Das\]stflul ) iiz * ramin Wahle . is t . 
That is a mush roon lREI, . II/ON in wood is " l'hat is a mush room which D ; tl ~ wood . ' This means that at ; the beg\]truing chikh'en can aot distinguish a relative pronoun of a gender fl ' on x ~ moth cr relat  , ive pronoun of a different gender ; e . g , between ' die ' and ' ( lair . Mills reports that the use of relative pronouns is equlppe  . d with the proper system of inflection only a . ft cr theage of '1 is reached . 
The significance of ( 25 ) and ( 26 ) is not crystal clear , iuci-dentally ~ if the u on sentence below is also taken into account  .

\] sting linguistic theories . A generalized const . laint(\]7) applica . 
ble to dynamic aspects of la . nguage processing , especia J \] y local structural ambiguity , has been demonstrated to account for the noun -complement case of the Complex NP Constrain  (  . , which seems hard te elucidate in static terms of traditional apt  ) roaches to syntax . 
One important aspect of our approachenlp Joyed here is the hypothesis tha  . tsomes or l , of local ambiguity is visible to and thus handled by the grammar  , lI'this hypothesis finally turus out true , which we have attempted to demo a strat ( . ', I . he statical ) proach pursued so far in the linguistic inquiries must be reconsidered  .  ' . l ' hatis , an explanation on timgrammal , icality of sentences will have to sometimes take into account  sere3 alpossible structures in parallel . 
The explanation of the same sort of island loud \ ] lion by Marcus/Marcus  1980/is comparable I , oours in that it also exploits local ambiguity , postulating rules handling them . Since Marcus pays no attention to what kind of ambiguity is visible and what kind is not  , howcver , his discussion has n <> thing to sa ~ y about between the two approaches i that Marcus exploits a stipulation called the determinism hypothesis  , whereas weernploy a more humble working hypothesis of parallel processing plus memory limitation  . 
A caution would be worthy of noting here . A success of computational explanation does not necessarily support either in natism  ( ~ laN . Chomsky , J . A . Fodor , D . Marr , etc . ) ore on struetivism ( ~ la J . Piaget , etc . ) . If any part of hmnanin-teliigence could be understood to be the outcome of a simple optimization for some computation  , it should subject o two different interpretations : that this part should be a domain-specific in nate en dowment because such a simple optimization may well be preprogrammed in the course of evolution  , or , con-trariwise , that it should be generated after birth by the work of the domain-independent general intelligence because such a simple optimization could be carried out through maturation and internal experiences  . Further scrutiny would thus be simply needed in order to steer our way either to innatistor con -structionist dispositior /  . 
Along the line of the present argument , perhaps the first point where we could face the choice between these two doc-trines is the problem of how much processing load we should ascribe to variou syntactic operations  . The evaluation of computational load as we have exploited here should vary across languages  , depending on the relative statuses of syntactic operations  . For instance , the situation must be drastic Mly different between dominantly head-initial languages like English and Spanish and head-final languages such as Japanese and Korean  ( and may be German , too ) . Also open to further scrutiny is whether the variation is explained by the parameter setting approach of transformational theories  , or by more general computational considerations .
