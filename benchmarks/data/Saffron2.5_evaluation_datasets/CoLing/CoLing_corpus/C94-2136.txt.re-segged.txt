TWP can make user reach a target English by their monitoring and controlling JapaneseEnglish conversion process ~ so that they can feel content with each step of every interactive assistances or automatic processes  . It can also save keystrokes for arranging word order as it generates English expressions in a correct word order by conversion capability of a phras % as in > pie sentence and a complex sentence  , besides word level dictionary consultation facility  . TWP also has proposed a protocol to eliminate redundant user keystrokes for selecting menu or commanding process by default reasoning to guess user's next stroke  . This means that no other keystrokes are sometimes necessary than those for inputting Japanese sentences  , as transh ~ tion is over at the same time of that a period of a Japanese sentence is keyed-in on a screen  . 
Whenever any error of conversion is found while inputting Japanese  , any step during the conversion can be cancelled and corrected by adopting the second alternative automatically based on keystroke history learning mechanism  . A cheap cancel and undo protocol is the key issue to make the best use of each default reasoning of TWP system  , because strokes to select correct one after cancels and undos are the sources for tuning up default reasoning by learning mechanism  . 
2 What is considered of for comfortable usabil ity ? TWP brings about both users ' contentment with functions that machine translation has failed to realize  , and large cost reduction ibr sentence generation in target language that simple dictionary consultation facility has not fulfilled  . No other system has ever been presented to satisfy two of them at the same time  . 
Machine translation system takes no hmnan cost if complete translation is acquired  . If any errors occur , however , manual retranslation or postediting charges vast amount of expense  . Post-editors have reported so many time high stress by repetitious or utterly unexpected errors machine translation caused  . Moreover , even when they use JapaneseEnglish automatic translation system ~ they are required to comprehend both languages in reality  . Experience of using dictionary consultation facilities and grammar checkers tells us that such assistance as bilingual dictionary reference  , sample sentence reference and grammatical check does not contribute so much to efficiency of translation and that the key operation cost taken to call those functions  , e . g . keystrokes , is essentially no less than that in case of consulting paper dictionaries  . 
TWP peribrms automatic recognition of a word , a phrase , and a simple sentence , and immediately after that , successive conversion based on bilingual word dictionary ~ and simple phrase and simple sentence translation functim  , is executed . These recognition , and conversion processes are supervised by the user in the course of inputting Japanese text  . TWP users reserve the means of cancelling and resolving the errors that the recognition or conversion created  . TWP makes users feel content with processes on a screen by confirming every step of translation with their eyes  . 
TWP supports so much easy use of dictionary consultation facility in such a manner that either English and Japanese word on a cursor position is interpreted as a keyword for looking up word and bilingual dictionaries  , and is transferred anytime automatically to consultation facility to retrieve and display the dictionary data on a pull-down window  . Users need not to take a special dictionary look up procedure  . 
It assists longer sentence gener , ~tioniEnglish word order by J/E conversion using complex sentence translation patterns defined by  users\[5\]  , as well as using a phrase and a simple sentence translation facility  . 
In the following chapter ~ we explain the overview of TWP  ; English producing support system at first then talk about Japanese-to-English interactive conversion framework for comfortable English composition in particular  . 
3 Which Resources support
English Composition ?
TWP for English composition support is constructed fl ' om well understood and transparent resources and mechanisms under an extended  , what is called , Kana-Kanji convcrsion user interface . The noble feature of tile ( PWP iutroduced hereafter ~ is of great transparency in every  1  ) rocess of support mechanism . ~ l ' he trace ability of process and the controllability of the TWP based on default reasoning mechanism in recognition and conversion of logical units in Japanese input  , and cheap cancellability of wrong steps selected by TWP or a user are a noble part of invention which supports a great cost reduction of English production on Japanese word processors with full of contentment  . 
The characteristics of TWP is summarized as follows  . 
1 . Japanese to English conversion interface simulating Kana-Kanji Conversion helps an user to learn so easily\[i  ,  3 ,  41 . 
2 . User controllable complex sentence translation pattern based cortversion achieves translation transparency even in long sentence J/E  conversion\[5  ,  8 ,  9\] . 
3 . Automaticle ~ rning feature based on user key stroke history covers learnings for translation disambiguations of words  , verb phrases , complex sentential conversion patterns , etc\[6\] .

Whenever TWP finds Japanese worden ( l , phrase endor clause end , the translation equiwdent is displayed on a screen line for inputting Japanese  . J/E conversioneeds scope determination of phrases and clauses  . The TWP iterates scope determination and conversion very explicitly on a screen for realising traceability and transparency of translation  . 
Two issues are left necessary to explain fllrther.
1 . How to determine a scope of conw ', rsion ? 2 . tIow to lind an appropriate type . of conversion ? The tlgure 2 of intuitive image of J/E conversion depicts the two issues more clearly  . 
4 . 2 How to al ign a sequence of conver-s ion step ? The scope determination tbr conversion is one of key issues to specify e emfortable user interfa  . ce . The con~version should be carried out successfully at any case  . 
( ) therwise , users cannot rely on the conversion support and have an xiety of operation  . The sequence of conversion steps shouhlal so be Lraceable within a limited human's eye capacity  , that is to say , which conversion scope selected by TWP should be able to guess  , and what sequence of conversions also should be for esee-M  ) le . User can catch up with every proce . ss very easily if user conhlexpectew ' xy kind of change on a screen  . 
TWP's idea to resolve user's anxiety (: ome . s from the above observation , to afford to the items 4 . and 8 . 
above greatly.
There are two reasonable scope interpretations for J/E conversion on the  screen1 where a cursor stays just after a Japanese string ~~ tNJ  ( ~ which is con > posed of two Japanese phrases ( bunsetsu is )  , \[*J , : I , g : Subject-marker , " I is the head of this u . oun phrase " bunsetsu \] , \[~3~: paper , ~: Object-marker , ' paper is the head of this noun phrase " bunsetsu \]  .

Figure 2 . Stepwise JapaneseEnglish conversion alternative scopes is " ~ Lt ? ~  ?3 C ( cursor ) " , and the other is " ~ gcC " . 
TWP adopts such a simple strategy as a scope tbr conversion is the biggest logical unit of words  , phrases , and clauses just adjacento C ( cursor ) on the left part of input line . This strategy comes from Japanese intrinsic linguistic structure called head final  . 
Whenever an input is don % it is transihrred to morphological processing to find logical units like word  , phrase , and clause . A logical unit is handed to J/E conversion function to produce English equivalent  . 
Japanese logical unit has a head word in the right most part of it usually so that ever y end of Japanese unit is guessed much easier than that of Fnglish  . Fortunately popular and robust algorithm of detectivgend of unit is widely known and it looks Mmad one word or one phrase to decide whether string on the left of cursor is on the endornot  . In practice , TWP may recognize the end of unit more easily by hearing unit ends ign Ms fi'om Kana-kanji conversion stroke as well  . 
TWP cangness scope of logical unit with high precision accordingly  . The screen1 and screen2 in the figure 3 shows a selected conversion scope is the left smallest phrase  ( bunsetsu ) which is usually sign Med by kana-hnji conversion keystroke  . 
4.3 Simulated Mode of Automatic J/E
Conversion
The " lookahead " algorithm detecting conversion scope by finding logical unit described above is also usable in another way  . An already guessed logical unit asi ~ logical unit a  . ul ; oma % icaily if the string ) it tile cur-sot couhl be guessed as a logical unit  ,  . This is calh Bda " delayed " type of look Mw . ad algorithm to finding lug-icall ) ttnsc ; sllunits , which frees users from inputting logical unit end siEna  .
