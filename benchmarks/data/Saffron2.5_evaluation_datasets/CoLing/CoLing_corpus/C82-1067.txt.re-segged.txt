This paper explains how to obtain the semantic information for the dictionary from an ordinary Japanese language dictionary with about  60  , 000 items ( which had already been put into machine readable form  ) and also explains what should be the frame for the representation of meaning of each item  ( word )  . The naman-assisted machine procedure that embeds the semantic graph with respect to the head word of the ordinary dictionary into the frame of a head word is discussed  . 
I . INTRODUCTION
There are following two obstacles to the construction of a practical size semantic dictionary for natural language processing  . One is that the number of words are so large that it is unknown from what and how to obtain semantic information necessary for the dictionary  ( tens of thousands general words should be accomo -dated  )  . The other is that it is unknown how to seize and represent the meaning of each word  . 
We are going to settle the problems as follows . For the first problem , obtain the information necessary for the semantic dictionary from ordinary dictionary of Japanese language by analizing the sentences defining head words  . For the second problem , represent the meaning of a word by using the frame the structure of which has been studied extensively by us for a couple of decade  ( YOSHIDA ( 1982 ) ) . 
Figure I is the outline of the construction steps of the semantic dictionary  . 
In this report we discuss , as preliminary stage of the construction , about the framing of the contents of the sentences defining words in the ordinary diction a -ry  . The discussions are to be held about the followings  . 
(1 ) Features of the structure and the contents of the sentence defining  ( des-cribing the meaning of ) a head word . 
(2 ) The use of semantic graph as a scheme for the representation of meaning  ( structure ) given by the sentence that define a head word in the ordinary dictionary  . 
(3) The frame to represent the meaning of a word.
(4 ) The way of embedding the information obtained from the semantic graph in the frame given by  ( 3 )  . 
(5 ) The way of obtaining the meaning ( definition ) of a word by unifying partial definitions " ( given by ( 4 ) ) concerning the word . 
2 . INFOR MATION OBTAINED FROMANORDIN ARYJ APANESE LANGUAGEDICTIONARY AND FEATURES OF THESENTENCES THATDEFINE HEADWORDS We have chosen the medium size Japanese language dictionary  ( Shinmeikai Kokugojiten , Published by Sanseido ) to use for constructing the semantic dictionary . 
The reasons for the choice of this dictionary are as follows  . 
( l ) The number of head words are adequate ( about 60 , 000 items ) . 
(2 ) Had already been put into machine readable form . 
(3 ) Put emphasis on describing the meaning ( signification ) of a word by sentences , and avoided mere restatement in other words . 
(4 ) Tried to classify the meanings of words into several large groups and avoided useless small groups  . 
Information that can be obtained from the dictionary are as follows  . 
(1) Syntactic information such as part of speech , inflection and conjugation . 
(2) The described meaning of a head word.
(3 ) Several classified meanings of a multivocal words . 
(4 ) Detailed meaning in its context and delicate shade of meaning of synonyms  . 
(5) Synonym , antonym and idiom ( idiomatic phrase ) . 
(6) Selection of significant words.
The features of words definitions in the dictionary are as follows  . 
(1 ) Symbols and abbreviations are used in place of sentences  . 
e . g .  ==~> . . . : make reference to .   .   . ~: the five conjugations of verbs (--) .   .   . : antonym is .   .   . ~: adjective ? . . : noun form i s - - . ~?: German ( language )   ( 2 ) PN type ( Noun modified by Predicate ) and NN type ( Noun modified by Noun ) phrase are used extensively . 
(3 ) Words are abridged from the sentence into which the meaning is condensed  , because of assuming the human use of the dictionary  . 
(4 ) The meaning of a head word is defined by viewing i t from some aspects or from its upper words  ( or synonyms )  . 
(5 ) When we look up in turn the upper words ( or synonyms ) of a head word , the explanation may be broken off , skipped or get into a cycle . 
3 . SE t , ANTICGRAPHREPRESENTATION OF A WORD DEFINITION The definition of a word should be given as accurately as possible in order to extract  ( meaning ) information for the semantic dictionary from it . Thus the semantic graph is introduced for the representation of the word definition  . The semantic graph which is a kind of semantic network consists of nodes  ( expressed by < . - . >) and arcs ( or links ; expressed by arrows ) connecting the nodes . The semantic graph with respect to a word is the conceptual dependency graph of the sentence  ( called semantic graph of the sentence ) defining the word . Nodes express the conceptual words ( nouns , verbs , adverbs , adjectives expressed with < . . . >) and arcs represent the relations between them . These relations are mainly given by the functions  ( called \] ink information ) expressed by the relational words such as particles  . 
Examples of relations or link information are : ' a kind of relation '  , ' case rela-tion ' , ' cause-effect relation ' , ' synonym-antonym relation ' , ' mode ' , ' attribute ' , ' state ' An exmaple of the semantic graph which is derived from the definition sentence " ~  ( drawing paper ) : ~< k ~? ~ B ? ~ ( white and slightly thick paper for drawing a picture  ) " is shown in Fig . 2 . In Fig . 2 , relational words are shown explicitly in Japanese which express the link information in the semantic graph  . When the more detailed relation between words is needed  , the relational information expressed by the relational word is transformed into the compound relation between words such as in Fig  . 4 . In Fig . 4, a relational word "?~?"( prep . 
for : used for the purpose of ) is transformed into the relation which contains some words  (  ' ~ ' ( use ) in this case ) and the relation ( ' object ' and ' for the purpose of ' )   . In the process of obtaining the semantic graph from a sentence  , it becomes frequently necessary to supply additional information  ( expressed by additional words and relations ) to the sentence . 
MAN-ASSISTED MACHINE CONSTRUCTION OF ASEMANTIC DICTIONARY  42~   4  . THEFP ~ A MEREPRESENTATION OF AWORDITION What sorts of information as a meaning of the head word are extracted from the semantic graph derived from the definition sentence in the ordinary Japanese dictionary ? In the case of the semantic graph of a word ' i ~  ( drawing paper ) ' in Fig . 3 , following information are extracted , bv means of looking up the upper word ' ~ ( paper ) ' of ' drawing paper ' and the linked relations between ' paper ' and the other words  . @drawing paper is a kind of paper , @slightly thick , ? white , @ used for drawing a picture . These semantic information can be extracted from the seman-tic graph of the definitions of a word ' paper ' through the views ' a kind of '  , ' attribute ( shape ) ' , ' attribute ( color ) ' and ' purpose of use ' . Here , ' a kind of ' is a relation between ' drawing paper ' and ' paper '  . Furthermore , from @ , semantic information such that ' drawing paper ' is the ' object  ( place ) ' for drawing a picture ' is obtained . This information denotes case relationship between ' draw ' and ' drawing paper '  . The above can be understood , from a different point of view , that the meaning of a word ' drawing paper ' is defined  ( described ) from the views such as ' a kind of ' ( relation )   , ' case ' ( relation ) , attribute ( e . g . shape , color ) and ' purpose of use ' ( basic viewpoint )   . We are aiming at constructing the frame of a word definition  ( called the frame of a word or the frame of def inition  ) by means of these views . What sorts of views should be prepared for the frame of a word ? 
Concerning the frame we cleared that : ( i ) Words ( to be exact , concepts ) are classified into four types , that is , concrete object , event , attribute ( state ) and abstract thing which are roughly correspond to concrete noun  , verb , adjective/adverb and abstract word . Each word has the frame corresponding to its type . 
( ii ) The frame is made up of which consist of the semantic relations  ( such as , a kind of relationships , case relationships , cause-effect relationships and whole-parts relationships  ) and basic views . As basic views for ' product'thing ( a kind of concrete object )  , we prepared ones shown in table 3 . 
( iii ) The frame for ' event ' word is mainly made up of case relationships  , cause-effect relationships , a kind of relationships and views of ' mode'(e . g . tense , possibility , in progress ) . These relationships are shown in tables l and 2 . 
5. UNIFICATION PROCEDURE
To give the full definition of a word , the partial definitions given in the form of frames are unified into a hierarchical structure by the unification procedure  . 
The definitions of the comparatively upper words in the hierarchical classification of the words should be given fine meaning while lower words are only given of their special meanings  , because the definition inherits from the upper words  . An example of the definition of a word ' drawing paper '  ( also , ' paper ') is shown in Figs . 5 and 6 , and also the definition of a word ' fire extinguishing ' is shown in Fig  . 7 . In Figs . 5 , 6 and 7 , the semantic information connected by the dotted lines are inherited  . In Fig . 6, some words ( e . g . ' stationary ' , ' instrument ' , ' product ' ) are skipped between ' paper ' and ' thing ' . Therefore , if these words are looked up and related with ' paper '  , the semantic information extracted from these words should be added to the definition  . There may be some shortage which cannot be supplied only by these unification procedures  , so that it should be given man-assistedly fine meanings to the comparatively upper words  . For example , in Fig . ~ the agent of ' Remove ' is ' Person ' and result of ' remove ' is ' vanish '  , therefore , also the agent of ' extinguish ' , ' fire extinguishing ' and so on can automatically be given if we have given the information in the fine definition  . 
6. CONCLUDING REMARKS
Although , in our preliminary investigation , we have prospect o ? using the ordinary dict ionary for the construction of the semantic dict ionary there are many problems  422 S . YOSHIDA , H . TSURUMARU and T . HITAKA to be investigated , which contain followings . 
(1 ) Determination of the frames for abstruct noun and attribute  ( state )  . 
(2) Semantic level of the ~ emantic graph.
(3) Definitions of individual thing and event.
(4 ) Development of the programs and supporting programs  . 
(5) Definition of the technical terms.
