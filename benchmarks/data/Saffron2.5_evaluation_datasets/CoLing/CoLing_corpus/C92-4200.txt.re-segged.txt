KNOWLED GEEXTRACTION FROMTEXTS BYSINTESI

In this paper we present SINTESI , a system for
the knowledge extraction from Italian inputs,
currently under development in our re , search centre . It is used on short descriptive diagnostic texts , in order to summarise their technical content and to build a knowledge base on faults  . 
Often in these texts complex linguistic constructions like conjunctions  , negations , ellipsis and anaphora e are involved . The presence of extragrammaticalities and of implicit knowledge is also frequent  , especially because of the use of a sublanguage . SINTESI extracts the diagnostic information by performing a full text analysis  ; it is based on a semantics driven approach integrated by a general syntactic module and it is able to cope with the complexity of the  ( sub ) language , maintaining both accuracy and robustness . 
Currently the system has been tested on about 1 . 000 texts and by a few users ; in the near future it will be used by dozens of users everyday  . 
1. INTRODUCTION
In the last years a great interest in the information retrieval from texts has grown  ; as a matter of fact the more the ability of memorising large quantities of data increases  , the more the difficulties in extracting grows . The classical information retrieval approaches that consider the input only from a formal point of view are not powerful or user-friendly enough  , as they are not able to cope with the real content of the texts  ; the quality of their results is generally poor . When a higher quality is needed , it is necessary to adopt methods derived from the field of the natural language processing  , to extract some structured knowledge ( as the objects mentioned and their relations )  . In this case different kinds of applications require different architectures  . As a matter of fact , tuextract information from news it is necessary to be able to cover a wide range of correct syntactic forms  , but a little of extragrammaticalities . At the same time the general knowledge sources are more important than the domain dependent \[ Jacobs  88\]  .

It aly wide syntactic overage is not the main needing  , but a large use of extragrammaticalities or a sublanguage must be taken into account \[ Liddy  91\]  . At the same time the domain dependent knowledge sources assume a main role  , especially because of the presence of the implicit knowledge  . 
In the latter case many of the approaches proposed in the field of NLP are not suitable or powerful enough  , as they should guarantee three main features : efficiency  , robustness and accuracy . 
E fficienc3~ is necessary because the input is generally long ( more than one sentence )  , requiring a strong treatment of phenomena such as anaphora and ellipsis  . Moreover , the efficiency is important when a system must operate in realtime  . 
_Rg bustness is needed because of the use of a sublanguage  , the presence of implicit knowledge and/or of ill -formed sentences  . 
is needed because the objects involved in a technical description are generally very complex from a linguistical point of view  ( for example a car part name may be composed by even ten words  )  , and these descriptions are generally affected by the problems of the sublanguage and of the implicit knowledge  . 
Accuracy allows to resolve those problems by using not only the knowledge of the world  , but the lingqtistic information , too . 
Accuracy and robustness are difficult to obtain at the same time  ; many classical approaches to natural language processing guarantee accuracy but fail in robustness  ; other methods are robust , but not accurate . The following techniques have been proposed in the last years to cope with the ill-fbrmedness\[ Kirtner  91\]: l . The addition of some special rules to a formal grammar\[Weischedel  83\]  ;  2 . The introduction of some grammar-independent syntax-driven \[ Mellish  89\] or semantics driven rules \[ Kirtner 91\]  . 
3 . The treatment of the ill-fbrmedness as a correct form of a sublanguage \[ Lehrberger  86\]  . 
4 . The Use of semantics driven approaches as case frame parsing \ [ Carbonell  84\]  . 
In this paper we present our experience in building a system to extract knowledge from short technical diagnostic texts  ; we adopted a full text semantics driven analysis integrated by the use of a general syntactic parser  . The ill-formed input is treated without introducing special rules or AC'TESDE  COLING-92  , NANTES , 2328 hOt~q"19921244 PROC .

2. OVERVIE WOFSINTESI
SINTESI ( Sistema IN tegratoper TES tiinltaliano ) I Ciravegna 89-921 is a prototype I or the knowledge extraction from Italian inputs  , perlorming a fidl-text analysis . It is used on short descriptive technical texts ( four or five sentences in seven or eight lines ) containing complex linguistic constructions like conjunctions  , negations , ellipsis and anaphora e . The use of extragrammatical language and of implicit knowledge is also frequent  . Typical of our domain ( carfault reports ) are the complex object descriptions ( a full car part description may involve the use of even ten words  )  . The goal of SINTESI is to extract the diagnostic information  ( mainfault , chain of c , ' tuses , chain of effects , car parts involved , etc . ) from each text and v , ) build its semantic representation . I the rest of the paper we will show how the different knowledge sources contribute to the text analysis and how they contribute to guarantee the robustness  , the efficiency and the accuracy . 
3 THESENTENCE ANALYSIS
S 1NTESI integrates five knowledge sources : lexical , syntactic , pragmatic , general semantic and world knowledge . The inlmt texts is first preprocessed by a morphological analyser with the help of a dictionary  ( cnrrently containing about 4 . 000 entries ) . A lexical-semantic analysis is then applied to recognise some special pattern such as ranges of data or numbers  , measurements , chemical formulas , etc , through a contextfree grammar . Some special preliminary information ( " the semantic markers " ) is also lint in the sentence to help semantics in the following steps  . 
The rest of the analysis is based on a semantics driven approach that integrates in a flexible way two modules dedicated to the linguistic  , two to to the semantic and one to the pragmatic analysis  ( fig .  1) . 
The semantic modules lead the analysis in order to pertbrm two main steps : object recognition and object linking  . This separation is introduced in order to be able to recognize fragments  , when a complete analysis is impossible . The syntactic modules are used to build the linguistic structure of the objects and of the whole sentence  . The pragmatics is mainly used to control the object linking  . Additional modules provide the discourse analysis and the correlation of the knowledge extracted in the different sentences of the text  . 
q~epragmatics and the additional modules are not discussed in this paper  . 
3 The formalism was developed in collaboration with a group of the University of Torino  . 
3.1 OBJECT RECOGNITION
The object recognition step processes the text from left to right trying to identify the objects in each sentence  . It is a bottom-up task that uses four kind of knowledge : the semantic markers  , the general semantic knowledge , the world knowledge and the syntactic knowledge . The schema of this step is shown in fig . 2 . The presence of the objects is shown by the ? m nti'm'rkrLput by the lexicon  . The markers activate an expectation in the semantic module that is used to control the analysis and guarantee the robustness  . The syntactic module is then activated to recognise the structural form of each object without trying to build a full sentence representation  . The know _~_~9~_gg \[ Campia et al90\] is represented by an independent grammar . The syntactic structure of the linguistic expressions is represented by dependency trees  . This kind of representation was chosen because it makes the syntax-semantics interaction easier  , tire interdependencies among words being shown in a very clearntanner  . The syntactic analysis is done by a set of production rules in which the conditions test the current reestatus  , whereas the actions modify it . A semantic test is performed immediately after each syntactic action in order to iln prove the efficiency and reduce the use of the backtracking \[ Ciravegna  91al   . Each semantic test activate stile semantic module which uses two kinds of knowledge to answer to the test and to build the semantic representation of the current object : the general antithe world knowledge  . 
The t~eneral semantic knnwled ~ , e is based on case frames and contains the basic intormation to answer to the question  ( general description of objects , intormation about roles and role-fillers , etc . ) . The case frame model was derived from the Entity Oriented Parsing approach \[ Hayes  84\]  . The information contained in the case frames produces a first hint on the identity of the object  . 
Performing a semantic test at this level means filling a role in a case franre  , The precise identity of all the already known objects is contained in the w_A ~ rld knnwled ~ e and it is lormed by the syntactic and semantic descriptions of each object \[ Lesmo  90  , 91\]3 . Only the objects interesting to t the knowledge extraction are contain exl in this structure  . Pertbrming a semantic test at this level means matching the syntactic repre~sentation othe containe descriptions via a set of structural rules  . 
Every accepted connection between two words contributes in filling both the roles of the case frame and to extract a semantic identity  . The syntactic analysis of the current object description ends when the next word is not belonging to the current object description  ( for semantic , pragmatic or linguistic reasons ) . The object is then closed and the contrul is returned to the semantic AcrEs DE  COLING-92  . NAI , ZfES . 2328 AOt ~" r1992l24 SPROC . OFCOLING-92 . NAI ~ rES . AUO .  2328 .   1992 controller that will try to identify another object  , until the end of the sentence is found . 
As examole of the analysis of a very easy description of a earfault  , consider : " F is saggidella coppa\[dell'\[ olio\[dellmotoreconcricche "  ( literally : " Bolts of the slump\[of the \] oil \[ of the \] engine with breaks '  )  . The first semantic marker is put on " fissaggi " that activates an entity of type " car_part "  ( fig . 3a ) . At this step the role-expectation given by the case frame shows that in the rest of the sentence we will probably have some other words specifying the current object and a fault associated to the car part  . The expectation given by the world knowledge is given by the following car part descriptions : a  . ( fissaggio(perno(baneo(motore )))) b . ( fissaggio(coppa(olin(motore )))) c . ( fissaggio(coppa(rici claggio(olio )))) d .   ( fissaggio ( ammortizzatori ( anteriori ( telaio ) ) ) ) These descriptions are transformed in the corresponding dependency trees  ( see fig . 3) . The syntactic module is then activated and it tries to connect " coppa " to " fissaggio " through the preposition " del "  ; the connection is semantically acceptable because there is a case frame plausibility  , and the preposition is acceptable for the connection  . Moreover there are domain based semantic descriptions that support he connection  ( ' b ' and ' c'only , because the others don't support the word " coppa  "  )  , so the semantic module is able to continue the current object building and the parser does the same  . The analysis continues in the same way until the word " cricche " is found  ; " cricche " is pointing to another kind of entity  ( afault )  , so the semantic controller stops the syntactic module  . The fault description is then analysed in the same way  . At the end of the object recognition we will have two objects : a car part  ( given by a case frame and the ' b ' description ) and at hult . 
SINTESI is able to cope with the loss of the determiners and prepositions in the description  , because the dependency grammar shows only the structural relations between the different syntactic types  ; for example a typical rule shows that a determiner  ( or a noun ) may be attached to a noun and not something like :" NP->det+Noun "  . This kind of ill-formedness are then overcome by the formalism  , without introducing metarules , sublanguage concepts or semantics driven rules . 
At this level the interaction between syntax and semantics brings to the object recognition from a structural and semantic point of view when the object is present in the world knowledge base  . 
When this identity is not known , it is possible to recognize the presence of the object by using only the syntactic module and the case frame level of the knowledge base  ( role expectation )  . Even if it is not possible to derive a direct identity  ( for structural reasons )  , it is possible to recognize it by using the role -expectation coming from the other objects in the sentence  . In this way , it is possible to maintain the accuracy on the identity and on the structure of the objects  ( if the description is already known )  , maintaining the robustness ( when it is not known or it contains unknown words or unsolvable gaps  )  . 
Note that even if the object recognition is semantics driven  , the approach is flexible : sometimes in fact it become syntax-driven  ; it happens to treat some special cases as the noun+adjectives+noun construction due to the loss of the preposition between the two nouns  . These forms often give origin to nominal compounds  , and , especially in conjunctions , bring to garden paths and different rules for the adjectives\[Campia et  al90\]  . 
3.2 OBJECT LINKING
When all the objects of a sentence are identified by the object recognition step  , a connection among them is tried , using the role-expectation contained in the case frame level  . There are two possible kinds of connection strategies : total linking and partial linking  . The first one is tried when no failures were reporte during the object recognition  . It integrates Bottom-Up ( BUS ) and Top-Down ( TDS ) strategies in order to build the structure of the whole sentence  . The TDS is an expectation-driven a alys is of the connections among objects  , driven by the main roles of some kinds of constituents  ( verbs , conjunctions , etc . ) . It is also driven by linguistic and pragmatic rules  . 
The TDS is not executed in a left-to-rightway and it is able to cope with some kinds of garden paths involved by conjunctions  . The B__U__S . is performed instead from left to right , and connects the objects not considered by the TDS  . For every object a role-driven connection is tried with all the objects that are linguistically and semantically acceptable  . 
A focus stack is used to control the connections.
A score is given to every linking . This score is integrated by other evaluations coming from the domain specific knowledge  . Different strategies on the connections are adopted according to different cases : it is possible that sometimes even some linguistically nonacceptable relations may be accepted for pragmatical reasons  . 
When the object recognition analysis reported some problems  , only the BUS is adopted in order to form some aggregates of objects  . This aggregation is influenced by the content of the unknown or incorrect parts of the input  . 
Connections among objects separated by obscure parts are considered unlikely  . A classification of the unknown parts is done trying to apply some lexical  , syntactic or semantic heuristic rules on the identity of the words contained  ( a main verb has a strong power of separation , a group of adjectives hasn't it , and so on ) . 
In the example of section 3 . 1 , the two objects ( the car part and the fault ) are linked via the slot ACr F . SDI~COL 1NG-92 . NANTES .  2328  . ~ Ot~19921246 PROC . OFCOLING-92 . NANTES , AUG .  2328 . 1992" with fault " of the first object . The connection is done by the BUS strategy because the lack of a verb in the sentence makes the system to hypothesize some gaps or ellipsis  . The result of tile analysis is shown in fig 3b . 
The separation between object recognitimt and object linking guarantees the accuracy  ( when possible ) and the robustness , by adopting different strategies according to the reliability rate of the object recognition  . Note that even the TDS+BUS allows to cope with sentences that don't bring to act nnplete structure  ( i . e . it is not possible to connect some objects to any role in the sentence  )  . 
It is possible because the BUS is always applied and it is this strategy that guarantees die robustness during the object linking  . 
4. ADVANTAGES OF THESCHEMA
The illustrated strategy fits our requirements of accuracy  , robustness and accuracy . 
Accuracy is achieved because the syntax-semantics interaction during the object recognition and the TDS+BUS  ( during the object linking ) bring to a lull sentence structural and semantic definition when the input is correct  . 
Robustness is achieved during the object recognition because the syntactic analyser is able to cope with some kinds of ill-formed input  ( the loss of prepositions and determiners )  , without introducing extra-rules . In any case the analysis is still lead by semantics  , so it is possible to force the syntactic module to accept an incorrect input  . 
Moreover the semantic previsional ability n takes us to cope with even unknown or incorrect object descriptions  . It is possible by excluding diew or ld knowledge and remaining at the case ti ' alnelvel  . 
The role-expectation driven analysis allows to detect the new descriptions attd to propose their addition to the knowledge base  . * The robustnessi also achieve during the object linking  , because it is possible to adopt different strategies to cope with different rate of understanding or ill-for lnedness  ( unknown parts of the input , the lack of some fundamental constituents a the verbs  , etc . ) . 
is guarantied because at the object recognition level each syntactic connection is immediately semantically tested  , so the interaction is efficient . Moreover the tests at the world knowledge level are efficient  , because they are reduced to a comparison between graphs  ( the current syntactic tree and the possible deep descriptious  )  ; it is particularly important in the reduction of the gaps involved by conjunctions 
I Ciravegna 9 lb\].
In addition the separation between object recognition and object linking allows to insert between them an additional module called SKIMMER that improves the efficiency  ; it is a function that , given the interesting types of objects furthe knowledge extraction  ( faults , car parts , etc . ) and the types of the ol3ject contained in the current sentence , decides if die sentence will bring new interesting information or not  . If not the object linking and knowledge extraction are skipped  . It is necessary to apply the skimmer after the end of the object linking  ( and not before ) because a negation or a semantic modifier may change the meaning of an object  . Moreover the anafora resolution is not affected by the skipping of a sentence  , because the objects are " already recognised . 
5. CONCLUSIONS
This paper presents a system to extract knowledge from domain-oriented ill-formed Italian inputs  . 
The tmrpose of the paper was to demonstrate how it is able to guaranteefficiency  , robustness and accuracy . SINTESI is currently used to extract knowledge fronl technical diagnostic texts on car faults  . From a linguistic point of view it is able to extract knowledge from sentences involving the use of noun phrases  , verb phrases and prepositional phrases ; the sentences may contain conjunctions , a limited set of garden paths and some kinds of subordinates  . The system has two ways to operate : an online mode in which each new text is analysed in real time and the extracted knowledge is approved or refused by the user  ; an oft-line mode to process the 40 . 000 texts that are already in a database . The extracted knowledge is used to generate search keys for the database  , for statistical matters antito build a knowledge base on faults  . One of the goal of the system is the transportability through the applications in the same domain  . Currently SINTESI has been tested on about 1000 technical texts ; the rate of the correctly extracted int ~ ormation was of about  85%  . Many problems came from not currently supported forms  , unknown objects or words , anticomplex garden paths . The system is able to process about 150 texts per hour running on a VAX 6510  . It was developed by using the N expert Object tool and the C-language  ; it is now running in a DEC-VMS environment . 
In the near future we will extend SINTESI in order to cover most of the linguistic ff  ) rms that are still not covered . A method to extensively cope with the implicit knowledge is under development  . 
Until now the system has been tested by few users , but it will be utilised by dozens of people with a rate of about  5  . 000 texts per year .
