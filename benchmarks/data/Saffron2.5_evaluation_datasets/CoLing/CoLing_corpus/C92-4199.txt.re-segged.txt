Abstract
Word Identification has been an important and active issue in Chinese Natural Language Processing  . 
In this paper , a new mechanism , based on the concept of sublanguage , is proposed for identifying unknown words , especially personal names , in Chinese newspapers . The proposed mechanism includes title . driven name recognition , adaptive dynamic word formation , identification of Z-character and 3-character Chinese names without title . We will show the e ~: perimental results for two corpora and compare them with the results by the NTIIU's statistic-based system  , the only system that we know has attacked the same problem  . 
The ezperimental results have shown significant improvements over the WI systems without the name identification capability  . 
1 Introduction
Word Identification ( WI , also known as Segmentation ) has been an important and active issue ill Chinese Natural Language Processing  . Various approaches are proposed for this problem \[1\]  , such as MM ( Maximum Matclfing ) method\[8\] , RMM ( Reverse Directional Maximum Matching ) metlmd , OM ( Optimum Matching ) method , statistical approaches \[5\] , and unification approaches \[12\] . lIowever , there are still a number of problems to conquer towards a satisfactory WI system  . Among them are a clear definition of Chinese words  , an objective valuation suite with appropriate corpora  , and the processing of unknown words ( such as personal names , place names , and organization ames ) . 
In this paper , we will deal with the problem of unknown words , especially personal names , althougii the proposed approach can be easily extended to cover place nantes and organization antes  . According to Chang , et al\[2\] , proper nouns ( which compose a major part of unknown words ) account for more than fifty percent of errors made by a typical system  . Thus , successful processing of proper nouns is essential for a satisfactory WI system  . 
Almost all WI systems use a lexicon to guide the segmentation process  . In fixed domains such as a classical novel or technical texts  , we can put all possible words in the lexicon and avoid the unknown word problem  . However , in a dynamic domain such as newspapers , it is impossible to enumerate all possible words in advance  . For example , some personal names , such as suspects or victims , often appear in only one day's news . Thus , recognition of these personal names and other unknown words is very important  . 
Chang , et al\[2\](at National Tsing-Hua University , tts in chu , Taiwan ) proposed a Multiple-Corpus approach to solve the problem  . They consider the WI problem as a constraint satisfaction problem  ( CSP ) and use a number of corpora to train their statistic-based system  . The probabilities of each Chinese character as a surnanm  , the first character and the second character in a first name are computed based on the training  . Using these statistics , two-character and three . character personal names are proposed to compete with the words in the lexicon  . Then , a dynamic programming technique is used to decide the most probable solution to the CSP  . They reported a 90 percent average correct rate of surname-name identification  . To the best of our knowledge , this is the only group that has proposed a solution to the problem  . 
Chang's approach is completely statistic-based and easy-to-implenmnt  . However , we argue that syntactic and semantic information must be considered in a success fid WI system  . 
2A Sublanguage Approach
The concept of sublanguages ( i . e . , languages in restricted domains ) has been considered very important in natural anguage processing  \[6  ,  7\] . A sublanguage usually has its own special syntax , semantics , and style , which are more restricted comparing with the language as a whole  . In this paper , we will show how the study of a sublanguage can help identifying names and forming them in a dynamic  , adaptive way . 
2.1 Observation
From the United News , one of the most popular daily newspapers in Taiwan  , we have acquired a newspaper corpus of more than one million characters  . 
This corpus has been used for building our lexicon  , computing statistics , and testing our WI systems for spellchecking , preprocessing for speech synthesis , Ac'lXSDECOLING-92 . NAN'r ~, 2328 A Otrr 1992 1239 FROC . OFCOLING-92 . NANTES . AtrG . 2328,1992 and phoneme-to-word conversion . 
After studying the segmentation output of the newspaper corpus  , we observed that ( 1 ) unknown words are mostly personal names ( translation ames or otherwise )  , place names , and organization ames in addition to those words that should have been built in the lexicon  ( a similar conclusion was obtained by Chang's papers  )  ; aud ( 2 ) when a personal name appears the first time , it is usually accompanied with a title ( such as taibels hizhang ~: ~ b ~: ~ Taipei may or or a role noun  ( such as jizhe\]~~reporter , houxian renIt ~ j  ~ , ~ . candidate ) . 
From these observations , we propose the following mechanisms to help identifying unknown words in the WI process :  ( 1 ) title-drive name recognition and ( 2 ) adaptive dynamic word tbrmation . 
2.2 Title-driven Name Recognition
As we mentioned above , it is not plausible to put all proper names in the lexicon for a dynamic domain such as news articles  . Since a new personal name usually appears with a title or a role noun  , we can use the clue to design a set of word formation rules in our parsing-based WI system  \[11\]   ( s ~ the next section )  . Part of the set of rules in augmented CFG format are : < name > ~--< title > < last > < first > Build < last > < first > as a name  ) < nurse > ~- < last > < first > < title > Build < last > < first > as a name  ) < title >+-< word > Test if < word > is ' a title < last > ~< word > Test if < word > is a surnanae  ) < first >*--< word > " lest if < word > is 1- or 2-char < first > ~-< word > < word > Test if both < word > are  1-char A Chinese name usually consists of two to four characters : one-or two-character surname and one-or two-character fist name  . Furthermore , surnames are among a limited set . Thus , in rule 4 , the augmented part is just a membership test . We can store the surname information as a feature in the \ [ exical entries  . Similarly , we have title and r~ole features in the lexicon for rule  3  . Note that in the current design , translation ames of foreigners and husband surname prefixing of married women cannot be correctly identified  . However , this approach works for eoma nonpersoual names that occupy a major part of unknown words  . 
2.3 Adaptive Dynamic Word Formation
After a new personal name is recognized through the set of rules described above  , the system will dynamically build a lexical entry for it  . Thus , if the name appears in later sentences in the news article  , it can be correctly identified . 
In Figure 1 is an example for adaptive dynamic word formation  . In the article , there are four Chinese names : ni2shu2 yah2 ~ ( 4 instances )  , ye4yinglhao2~'I~(1 instance) , eai4 jialtlng2 ~ (4 instances ) , and wu2xun2 long2~:~(1iustance) . In first instances , all four names come with a title : lao3shil ~ ( teacher )  , ji4zhe3\]~(reporter) , er2 tong2 ~ ( child ) , and jian3 cha2 guanl~i ~' E " ( prosecutor ) . Since the names are built in the lexicon dynamically  , the other instances of the names can be identified with higher scores than names without title  . In other words , the names with title are built with much more confidence  . 
2.4 Names without Title
In addition to the names with title or role , the other personal names are proposed through a surname-driven rule  . In other words , when the WI system meets a surname word , a personal name proposing rule is invoked although its preference score would be much lower than regular words and names with title  . 
2.5 Place Names and Organization

The proposed mechanism can be extended to cover place names and organization ames  . Just llke personal names appear with title , place names can be identified through the unit such as xian ~  ( county )  , shii ~ i ( city ) , jieff~(street ) , lut ~( road ) , etc . Similarly , organization names can be identified by the type such as gongsi/C ~  ( company )  , bun\[~(department or ministry ) , ke~(section ) , and so on . This part has not yet implemented in our system . 
3 The System
Since July 1986 , we have been involved in developing a series of Chinese-related NLP systems  , ' including an EnglishChinese MT system , a Japanese-Chinese MT , a Chinese Word Knowledge Base , a Chinese Parser , and a Chinese Spell-Checker . tIere , we will only briefly describe the Chinese WI system as a frontend for the Chinese Parser  . For more details , the reader is referred to Wang , et al\[11\] . 
We consider the WI process as a parsing process with word composition grammar  , instead of a CSP problem\[2\] , a unification problem\[12\] .   .   .   . scanning process . A set of Chinese word composition grammar rules are designed to capture the characteristics of Chinese words  . The gramma representation is Augmented CFG which is also used to write the English grammar in our EnglishChinese MT system  . 
The parser we used is based on Tomita's Generalized LR Parser  \[10\]  . I to we ver , the augmented parts ( tests and actions ) and preference scoring module have been added . 
AUIESDECOLING-92, NAr~r\] . : s . 2328 no ~ r19921240 PROC . OFCOLING-92 . NANTES , AUG .  2328 ,   1992 ~ ~' ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ? ~ Figure 1: An Example for Adaptive Dynamic Word Formation Ill the WI process  , the basic unit is a character . 
A Chinese word is composed of one to five ( may be longer ) characters . 
The WI system consists of a lexicon , the word composition grammar , the preference scoring module , the test functions , and the parser . 
The lexicon contains a list of Chinese words ( sorted by the internal code order ) with the following information : the characters from wblch the word is composed  , its frequency count , its part of speech , and some semantic features ( such as title , surname , and role ) . The lexicon is a general purpose one ; that is , it is built independent of the testing corpora . Currently , there are more than 90 , 000 lexical entries in the lexicon . 
A rule in the word grammar consists of a contextfree part and an augmented part  . Iq addition to the unknown word identification described in the previous section  , augmented parts are used for recognizing ( 1 ) replication of words ; (2) nmnbers ; (3) prefix e ~ ; (4) suffixes ; and (5) the determiner measure constructions . 
Since the word parser would produce two or more parses for an ambiguous sentence  , a preference scoring module has been designed to choose the correct parse  . Currently , the preference score is assigned based on ( 1 ) the length of the word ( longer words are preferred )  , (2) the frequency count , and (3) semantic consideration ( e . g . , three-character personal names are preferred to two-character ones  )  . The WI system is written in Common Lisp , running on a TI
Micro-Explorer machine.
4 Experimental Results
Before we present he experimental results , two performance indices , recall rate and precision rate , of a WI system are defined below following Sproat and Shih  \[9\] and Chang , et al\[3\] . Let C be the segmentation results hy the computer  , H the results by the human ( the correct results )  , and I the intersection of C and II . Then , recall rate is I divided by tI , and precision rate I divided by C . Fo ~" example , if there are 20 words in a sentence ( i . e . , H equals 20) , the WI system produces 22 words for the sentence ( i . e . , C equals 22) , and there are 18 words m common ( i . e . , I equals 18), tile recall rate would be 0 . 90 and the precision rate 0 . 82 . 
To demonstrate tile proposed mechanism , we have tested the W\[system with two corpora :   ( 1 ) ten articles from a newspaper corpus , the United Daily corpus , (2) 61 sentences from Chang et al\[4\] . The first corpus is selected from the United Daily on March  8  ,  1991 . The selection criterion is that the article does not contain any table or figure and  , preferably , contains Chinese names . The second corpus is composed of difficult cases for which the NTHUWI system either cannot identify the names or overgenerates some 
Chinese names.
In the experiment , we use four versions of the WI system to segment heten articles  . Version 1 is the WI system without name recognition capability  , Version 2 the system recognizing only names with title , Version 3 the system recognizing both names with title and 3-character names , and Version 4 also recognizing 2-character names . 
Recall rates ( RR ) and precision rates ( PK ) are computed automatically by comparing the segmentation output with the correct answers egmented by human  . 
The experinmntal results are summarized in Table 1 . 
From the table , we can observe the following facts : 1 . Version 2 ( It ~: 96 . 17, PR:93 . 46 ) has a significant improvement over Version 1 ( RI~:94 . 77, PR:89 . 28) . In other words , the capability for name recognition is very important in a WI system  . Although Version '2 only has a limited capability ( for names with title )  , the improvement is rather apparent . Note that in Version 2 , the dynamic word formation mechanism is much more useful than in Version  3 or 4  . 
2 . Version 3 has the best results ( RR . :97 . 51, PR . :98 . 19) among the four versions . It is better titan Version 2 for tile obvious reason : the capability for identifying  3-character names without title . 
3 . Although Version 4 has one more function , identification of 2-character names without title , than Version 3 , the result ( ITK : 96 . 32, PR:97 . 51) is slightly worse than Version 3 .

4 . We will analyze the imperfections by the WI system in a subsection after the comparison with 
NTIIU's system.
Comparison with NTHU's System
In Chang , et al\[4\] , which we will call NTHU's system , they reported a 95 percent precision rate and a recall rate greater than  95 percent , and listed 5 sam-plea ( A-samples ) the name in which their system can identify correctly  , 34 examples ( B-samples ) for which the names are missed , and 22 examples ( C-samples ) for which Chinese names are overgenerated . Among them , we found 3A-samples , 6B-samples , and 3 C-samples contain personal names with title . Since NTHU's system is completely statistic -based  , it cannot make use of the title information . On the other hand , our sublanguage-based system would process these samples correctly  . 
These 61 examples are fed to our WI system for comparison of the name recognition algorithms  . The following results are for reference only , since the comparison is rather unfair ( the examples are mostly the eases their system cannot recognize correctly  )  . 
1 . For the 5A-samples , our system can recognize four of them . The only A-sample it failed to identify is : huang2   rong2   you2   you2   de0   dao4 jli ~ ~ ~ ~ il ~ . Our segmentation result is huang2-rong2-you2   you2 de O dao4  , while the correct result is huang2-rong2   you2-you2   de0   dao4  . 
The reason is ( l ) our lexicon does not have the adverb you2-you2 , and ( 2 ) we prefer 3-character names over 2-character ones . Note that NTHU's system can process all 5 cases successfully . 
2 . For the 34 B-samples , our system can identify 25 of them correctly . That is , there are 9 B-samples the names in which both our system and NTHU's system cannot identify  . We will discuss the reasons why these cases can not be recognized in the next subsection  . 
3 . For the 22 C-samples for which NTHU's system over generates personal names  , our system has processed 16 of them correctly . We will discuss the reasons in the next section why our system also overgenerates personal names for the other  6 C-samples . 
4 . For these 61 samples , our system can process 45 of them correctly . 
Some Imperfections
There are still some problems remained unsolved in our WI system  . Some are problems for WI systems in general . ' rite others are specific to name recognition systems only  . 
1 . Two-character names are difficult to recognize , especially when followed by a single-character word  . For example , in yiljing 4ganglha3fa3bao3qu3chul~1~1\]~ , ~\ ]~  , yil-jing4 is a 2-chaxacter name . However , our WI system produces a 3-character name yil-jing4-gangl   , since gangl(just ) is a single character word . Although human usually can identify the names correctly by context  , our Wl system proposed the 3-character names understandably . 
2 . The name of a maffied woman is usually prefixed with her husband'surname  . Thus , a 3-character name would become 4-character , i . e . , husband's urname , father's surname , and a 2-character given name , e . g . , xu3lin2yah2mei2 ~1  ~ . Currently , this kind of names cannot be identified correctly  , although a word-gramma rule can be easily added . 
3 . Some single-character surnames , such as l is a 2( year ) , tangl~(soup ) , ceng2 ~( once ) , and husng2 ~( yellow ) , are common single-character words . Thus , the name recognition algorithm sometimes overgenerates a personal name by ACRESDE  COLING-92  , NANTES . 2328 AOt ) r19921242 Paoc . OFCOLING-92 . NANTES , AUG .  2328 .   1992 combining one such word with two following characters  . 
4 . Some surnames are rather unusual , such as lian ~( lotus ) , ping2~(duckweed ) , and que 4 ( but ) . This would make the names not recognizable . There is a tradeoff between a complete surname list and a minimal common surname list  . On the one end , a complete surname list would help name recognition but it helps over generation as well  . On the other end , a minimal list would limit the overgeneratiou while missing some would be names  . 
5 . Some single-character words are very difficult to identify when they can be grouped as two -character words with the characters in the neigh -bout  . A famous example is ba3shou3 ~( a handle ) . The problem is very difficult to solve for any WI systems  . 
6 . Even when the title information is used , overgeneration of personal names is still hard to avoid  . 
In the following is one of such examples : ? yao l  qlng3   tai2   hal3   di4   fang1   fa3   yuan4 zhangl lu3   xue2   jian3   eha3 guanl tan2   yao4   wu4   lan4   yong4   wen4   ti2  . 
Both the correct name zhangl-lu3-xue2 ~\[~ Jl ~ and an overgenerated name tan2-yao4-wu4   1 ~ are produced by our system . A fine adjustment of the scoring fnnctiou should be able to overcome this problem  . However , there are so many similar problem such that it would be a real problem when we develop a full scale system  . 
7 . In Version 4 of our system ,   2-character names without title are recognized in addition to those of Version  3  , i . e . , names with title and 3-character names without title . However , both the recall rate and precision rate of Version  4 are lower than those of Version 3  . The major reason is that too many 2-character names are generated . 
5 Conclusion
In this paper , we have proposed a new mechanism for identifying unknown words  , especially personal names , in Chinese newspapers . The proposed mechanism includes title-drive name recognition  , adaptive dynamic word formation , identification of 2-character and 3-character Chinese names without title . We have also shown the experinmntal results for two corpora and have compared them with the results by the 
NTHU's WI system.
Although there are still some problems remained unsolved  ( as discussed above )  , the experimental results have shown significant improvements over the WI systems without the name identification capability  .
