A proposal to deal with tenses in the framework of Discourse Representation Theory is presented  , ms it has been implemented for a fragment at the IMS for the project LILOG  . It is based on the theory of tenses of H . Kamp and Ch . Rohrer . The system uses tile tense and aspect information  , the information about the temporal discourse structure of tile preceding text stored in a specific list of possible reference times  , and background knowledge . These types of information interact in order to choose a suited temporal anchor for the event of a new sentence  . 
With respect o extended texts , choosing the right reference time for a new event is a problem which has been largely neglected in the literature  . 
1 Introduction
In Reichenbach ( 1947 ) the tenses are analyzed into different order lngs of the relevant emporal parameters which are : the time of the event talked about  , the speech time ( time of utterance ) and the reference time . Simple past , for instance , identifies event - and reference-time , which are both before the speech time . 
In the case of past perfect he event time precedes the reference time which precedes the speech time  . 
Kanlpattd Rohrer (1983 , 1985 ) we reled by text-phenomena to split up the Reichenbachian reference time into two contextually given coordinates : the reference time  ( in the narrow sense ) and the temporal perspective time . 
(1 ) Harry handed the book about giraffes to Jane ( el )  . 
Two hours ago he had descover edit in Alfred's book-shop  ( e2 )  . He had bought it ( es) , had inserted a dedication ( e4 ) and had it wrapped up ( e  ~ )  . Jane took the book with a smile(e ~) In (1) , the events e2-e5 are ordered consecutively , * This research as been done in the context of LILOG  . 
Thanks on this way to the members of the LILOG -researe h group of IBM for help full comments and especially for having made the integration of the suggested system in the LILOG-prototype possible  . 
each taking its predecessor as reference time , with the exception that the context does not provide au event which precedes  e2 and which , therefore , could play the role of reference time with respect to  e2  . 
Tile whole sequence 2 -es is seen from a vantage point in the past , el , which , therefore , plays the role of perspective time with regard to the structural integration of  e2  -  c5  . The perspective from which e 1 and es are seen is the speech tinle , et serves as reference time for c ~ . In the approach of Kamp and Rohrer the role that the reference time plays in Reichenbach's system is taken over by the perspective time with respect to the meaning of the tenses in single sentence discourses : The meaning  ( one of tile meanings ) of past perfect is that the event tittle precedes the perspective time which precedes the speech time  . The meaning of simple past is that the event time precedes the speech time which coincides with tile perspective time  . However , in addition to a system like Re-ichen bach's there is another parameter which comes exclusively from the text  , the reference time proper , which is part of tile impact of the tenses on the temporal reconstruction of a narrative  , titus completing the sentential meaning of the tenses by a textual aspect  . Here , the idea , that we take over from Kamp and P ~ ohrer , is that in a sequence of simple past sentences introducing events  ( not states ) normally the event of a news enteuce follows the reference time which is provided by the event of the preceding sentence within the sequence  . By transposition the same should hold for sequences of past perfect sentences  . 
Here , the perspective is shifted from the speech time to a  ( contextually given ) point in the past . There is an additional feature however with respect o temporal parameters  . Adverbials can provide a location time for events and states  . For instance , in (1), the 1 o . 
cation time of e2 is the time pointed to by two hours ago . 
On the basis of the Reichenbachian pproach using three temporal parameters the problem of integrating a new event in the event structure of tile preceding text has been attacked by Hinrichs  ( 1986 )  , Partee (1984) and others . More independant of this approach are suggestions made by Moens and Steed-malt  ( 1988 aatd by Webber ( 1988 )  .

OFCOLING-92, NANTES , AU6 . 23-28 ,   1992 Since wetl link tl tatit correct an Mysis of narrative seamlot do without a finegrained distinction between the roles played by temporal anchors  , our ap-lu ' oach uses the coordinate suggested by Kamp and Ptnllrer  . Such coordinates arc stored in a structured list . , called T-list , which rettects the discourse structure of the preceding text  . Thel ) rol ) lem of choosing t imright anchor for the new event froln the preceding text is largely neglected in th cliterature  . Very often there , tile preceding text consists of only one sentence or tile problem is restricted to thc intrasentential one presented by temporal conjunctions  . How do we decide in ( 1 ) that the reference time for ca is not tile earlier introduce del  , but e2 and that the reference tinlefore ( t is not the most recent reference time es , butel':hi our system we use tile structure of the T-list aluong other things to get a hierachy of the topicality of tile rcfi ~' rene etimes  . This is very ch ) set otim idea of accessibility in Discourse Rel ) resentatiou Theory ( Kamp ( 1981 ) ) and to tile notion of focus in the work of Grosz and Sidner  ( 1985 )  . Illor ( ler to tackle tile task of event-integration , which we call " tempor M resolution "- slaking Mhtsion to the very similar probteln of the NP -resohltion  , where anaphoric links for the c~me of nominals have to be established-we struct ~  . lrc the T-list along the lines of different discourser cla-tions such ms continuation  , elaboration , flashback etc . 
Fla-sllback , for instance , holds in the example above between e 1 all de 2 and between elall d e3  . Tile relation between e2 and c3 is contimmtion . As we will set ' ill the section after next , often , fi'om the purely linguistic l ) oint of view timre are alternatives with resl ) ect to the decision about the discourse relation which directs theiutegration of a new event or state  . 
Ill our system , the criteria to decide about the relevant discourse relation are provided by tile tense fi  ) rlus of the reference vent ( s ) and of the new event respectively , by tile existence a airl the elmracteristics of temporal adverb iMs  , by the , aspect of the events-is it all event proper or a state - and by internals e  . luantic properties of the events whicil are made explicit by means t  ) frules store dill the background knowledge . 
Of course , in addition , tile hierarchically structured T-list inflnences tile cl to ice and helps to update the system correctly  , where updating means adding a new teln poral condition to the representation of the text and a  ( lding a new referelte etime to timT-list at , a specific l ) htee . 
Intlm next section we will briefly introduce tile kind of discourse representation structures that we use  . Then we wilt say something about the discourse relations deidt with and wel  ) resentile syntax of tile T-list . After tl tat we sketch the relevant background knowledge and finally  , we give some of the resolution rules of tilt ' system  . 
The structuring of tile T-list extents a suggestion of Eberle and Kasper  ( 1989 ) and comprise selenlents of a proposal by Reyle ( 1986 )  . 
Tile algorithm suggested is part of the LILOG -prototypewitic his used for text understanding  . In Affl\]~s DECOLING-92 , NANTES ,   2328 A Ordr 1992 particular it uses kaowledge provided by tile knowledge base and the inference component of the prototype  . 
2DR ; F and Events
Witidntile framework of Discourse Representation Theory  ( DRT )   ( Kamp ( 1981 ) ) a Discourse Representation Structure ( D1LS ) is a pair < U , K > consisting of a set U of discourse referents ( DRFs ) and a metK of conditions . DRSs are interpreted model theoret-ically . DRT uses a variant of tim Davidsonian method of talking about events : timy are treated as a kind of objects  . 
In LILOG we use DRSs for text representiLtions.
But we deviate front the cla . ~sic MDl ~ F-style in using one-placc event predicates and thematic roles instead of n-place ew  ; nt predicates . A second difference is given \] W the fact that in  L1LOG DllSscome with all ind cx . The index is the list of reference tinles available with respect othe DR Sill question  . For a simple sentence it will b calist consisting only of one element-the DRF of the event introduced-for a text it will lie a CO mll lcxlist  , tit(:T-list . 
So , for instance , the LIL ( )G-DILS for cominy o\]x can be illustrated i~s follows : a  ( le~tt ( e ) = xFor the \] ) ITS to be valid there must exist an embedding function which nmpse onto an event of the model structure such that esatisfiestile conditions as described ill the I  ) RS . 
3 Discourse Relations
It is clear that the idea about tile order of events introduced by sequences of sentences that w c have sketched in the introduction is an oversiln pfification  . 
Iuthefolh ) wing we will restrict ourselves to the tenses prevailing in narrativ cs  , silnple past and past perfect , and to only some of the text pllenomena related to these tenses  ( as we have done illtile LILO Gilnl ) lelnentation with respectotile German counterparts of these tenses  )  . 
3csi ( lestile disl:ourse relations used ill CX alnple ( 1 )  , i . e . tl~sh back and continuation , there are at least two nlore , which we callel abo ~ vlt lon and backg Tound . 
Conlp are the two fi ) \] lowing exalllples : ( 2 ) Mouday Hans went to Par~s . Tuesday hemet

(3) Monday Hans went to Paris . At the border he had some trouble . 
(2) dcscril ) es a continuation . This can lie deduced from the characteristics of the location times  . 
289 P Rec . oY COLING-92, NANTES , AUG .  2328 , 1992 In contras to that , (3) describes an elaboration . 
We call the relation between a new event e2 and its reference ventel an elaboration , if e2 describe set on an mrefine grained level ( which gives rise to the temporal condition of inclusion  ( C _ ) between the new event and tile reference vent within the representation of the text  )  . 
In ( 3 ) the relation of elaboration can be deduced only if there is some input from the knowledge base equipping the resolution component with facts about journeys to foreign countries  . Notice that , here , the temporal inclusion is due to the hommnorphic local inclusion of tile border into the path of the travel  . 
This illustrates that an intelligent temporal resolutimt component cannot do without having access to local reasoning  . 
Now compare the following pair of examples , taken from Dowty ( 1986 ) and from Hinrichs ( 1986 ) respectively : ( 4 ) John entered the president's office . The clock on the wall ticked loudly . 
(5) James on entered the room , shut the door carefully and switched off the hght  . It was pitch-dark around hint because the venetian blinds were closed  . 
hi both ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) the last sentence introduces not all event proper  , but a state . As widely accepted , the normal case of relating a new state e2 to an existing reference ventel seems to be that of inelusiml  ( e , C_e2) . l However , as exaal ples like (5) make clear , tills default can be overwritten . Hereton , it seems that back-grmmd knowledge gives the decisive indication about when the default has to be upset  . 
We call the discourse relation of ( 4 ) background and that of ( 5 ) causally introduced background . For cases like ( 5 ) we introduce tile new state e ~ a . s following the actual reference ventel ( el-<e2 ) and as including a dummy reference time t ( tC e : ) with respect o which e2 introduces a backgrouud , ht the filrther course of processing the text , thas to be in-stautiated by a new event which is understood as following el  . 
The T-list makes use of these discourse relations as structuring elements  . For instance , processing the saml fletext (6) , which integrate stile text phenomena reflected by the examples  ( 1 )  -  ( 4 )  , should result in a representation which has as index the T-list  ( 7 ) : 6 ) John left Paris by the Portede 5 ~ Cloudlate in the evening ( el )  . He went to Frank for t(e2) . 
At the border he was stopped ( e3) . It was pretty dark ( eJ . Onlya . fewlights were burning ( es ) . He had to open hz . ~ boot(es) . In Parishe had bought five cartons of e : garettes  ( e7 ) and had hidden them in the car ( es )  . 
The customs officers missed them ( eg.
I This parallels , for instance , the insights of Partee (1984) , Hinrichs (1986 l , Kamp and Rohrer (1985) and others . 
Early in the morning John entered a bar near the mess to wer in Frank for t  ( elo )  , ordered a beer ( el1 ) and lighted a cigarette ( el2 )  . He was happy ( et a ) . 
(7) el .   .   .   . s2 .   .   .   .   el0 - - ell - - el2 /\/\/el\/bg\/\/\/\ e13   e3   .   .   .   .   .   .   . e6 .   .   .   . e9/\/\/bg\/:fb\e4 , aSe7 , e8Ill ( 7 ) the structure of ( 6 ) is stored in the following way : el , c2 , s is , el1 , el2 ( the leaving of Paris , the going to Frank for t , the entering tile bar , the ordering of beer and the lighting the cigarette  ) on tile one hand and ea , e  o , e0(tile stoppiug , the opening of the boot , the failure of the officers ) on the other form continuation chains ( tied up in the picture by -- )  . The second of these chains elaborates an event of the first  , e2 , tile transition to Prank for t(el/\) . e4 and e ~ serve as background to e a , cla is the background of e12 ( bg/\) . 
Finally , the continuation chain c7 - ea is a flashback seen from the perspective es . 
We define tile accessibility of all event as reference event in such a way that  , having processed the whole text , the only accessible event will be elz , whereas , in the case of having processed the text till the integration of es  , the accessibl events will bees , es and e2 ( with decreasing prominettce ) . In this situationes is the socalled actual reference vent  . When integrating a new sentence , one will try to expand the node represented by the actual referent first  . But , finally , what level has to be chosen and what kind of anchoring has to be stored in the next step is decided by the system rules  . So , for instance , in the case of (6) , by purely linguistic reasons , e a cannot be related to tile actual reference event  e8  , because there is a tense switch from past perfect o simple past between es and es which indicates the termination of the flash-back  . This results in tile re-initialization of the levelttle flashback started from as the level providing the new actual referent  . In the case of ( 6 ) this is cs which is a member of an elaboration . Actual elaborations may be terminated by knowledge indicating that expanding the structure at the actual evel is not plausible or even not possible  . In this case the system will try to relate the new event with respect otile  ( accessible ) vents of higher levels of the elaboration hierarchy  . Since , with respect o (6) , eg is compatible with e2 the system has no reason to terminate the level marked by  e0  . We think that the data confirm the concept of a hierarchy of reference vents as used in the system  . The exact defiuition of the accessible reference events of a T-list resides in the definition of the specific access-functions for T-lists that we sketch ACTE  . SDECOLING-92 , NANTES , 2328 AOt ~ r1992290 PRec . OFCOLING-92, NANTES , AUG . 2328,1992 in section 5 . 2In fact , illtile LILOG implementation , tile items of the index , i . e . of the . T-list , do not consist of the pure events . They are terms with different slots filled hythe relevant emporal information such mstile tense form which introduces the corresponding event  , the , xspect , the actual speech tittle etc . Skiplfing such technical details , the simplified syntax of the T-list is the following : 
T-list :=\[\];\[E(D-list)JT-List\]where
E(D-List ): list item with
E : the discourse referent for the event , and D-List : tile list of the items depending on the event  , where
D-List :=\[\] ; \[ bg(\[E(\[\]) lT'-List\])lD-List\] ; \[fl ) (\[ E(D-List)lW-List\])\[D-List\] ; \[ el(\[E(D-List ) lT-ListDID-List\] ; Here , of course , embeddings which are given by the dimensions by , fb , el in turn stand for background , flash-back and elaboration . T'-List is a T-list where each D-list is the empty list  . We use T'-List for the items ill bg-lists , because we do I lot think that a background give rise to further embeddings  . The neighborhood of T-list items of the same level signifies continuation  , excep the case where such a list is fl ' onted by bg  . In this case , in the corresponding DtLS the elements of the list include the same event and  , therefore , overlap each other . Continuation is reflected in the reversed order , because we use T-list as a stack . For (6), according to (7), we write (8) . Here mid in the following we abbreviate E ( \[\] ) by E : ( 8 ) \[ el2 ( Ibg ( \[ ela D\] )  , e11 , el O , e2(\[el(\[e9 , e6(\[fb(\[eS , eT\])l) , e3(\[bg(\[e5 , e4 l )\])\]) , ellOfcourse , there are other discourse relations ~ those mentioned  . Especially , if one tries to analyse the structure of texts on a more finegrained level than the purely temporal one  , the relations described are not sufficient , others like explanation , contrast etc . 
are needed , sFor lack of space , here , we cannothing say about these . The relations described are those 2Anchoring newevetlts to non-accessible reference events clearly is possible  , provided there is additional information to motivate this clmice  , such as , for instance , definite descriptions using event nomlnalizations in order to establish cc-referentiallty  , But , at present , such possibilities are not implemented . 
3 Partly for other purposes discourse or rhetorical relations are tlsed  , for instance ~ in Grosz and Sidner (1985 , Thompson and Mann (1987 . 
dealt with illtile LILOG system.
4 Background Knowledge
The LILOG knowledge base provides us with a sort hierarchy for discourse referents which is related with respect o events to tile classification given in Vendler  ( 1967 )  . This sort hierarchy is used as one of several information packages within the temporal resolution  . With respect othe hierarchy we mainly use calendar knowledge and incompatibilty-statements about even types  . For instance , all event introduced with the location time 1987 ( or with subintervals of 1987 ) cannot overlap with an event with location time 1988  . Exactly the same is true when the new event has an even type which is incompatible with the type of the reference vent  . ASWIMMING-event is incompatible with a WRITING -event if tile relevant he-rustic roles are the same  , i . e . , here , the agent-role . Of course , when for nlulating such incompatibilities one tries to make use of the sort hierarchy  . One will define the incompatibility for very general sorts  ( if possible ) so that it is inherited by subsorts . 
Knowledge of this kind is hard information so to speak  . In addition to this , the system uses default knowledge about event ypes which is similar to what is cldled event f ~ nmes  ( cf . Miusky (1975) , Schank and Abelson (1977) , Bartsch (1987) and others) . Typical ( simplified ) examples of the two kinds of knowledge are ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) :  ( 9 ) VEIC MOVE , LELOC ( Lcpath ( El ) -~3E2 ePLACED-AT ( theme ( El ) = theme ( E . ~)^E~C_E1)) (10) VE ~ ETURN , E . 2e BEING-LIGHTED ( object ( El ) E L1GHT-SWITCIt A E~meetsE1 --* o 3E3 eBEING-DARK ( Elmeets E : l ) )  ( 9 ) regulates the localization of the theme of a move -meat  . From this rule we infer the existence of different PLACED-AT-states for the thente within the movement  .   ( 10 ) predicts that normally ( Dfl ) r default ) turning a switch when it is lighted results in darkness  . 
5 Temporal Resolution
The construction of tileseulantic represeutation for a discourse proceeds in several stages  . I shall skiphere the steps leading to the DRS of a sentence  . But it has to be stressed that tile result of sentence processing is not a completed DRS  . There may be variables which have to be instantiated in the process of integrating the sentence-DRS into the text-DRS  . 
The sentence-DRS is understood as the input of the aspect-calculus of the prototype which has to contpute the aspect of the events of the DRS  . Therefore it uses tile inform ~ t tion provided by the thematic roles  . The starting point is the aspect-entry for the ACTESDE  COLING-92  , NANTES , 2328^OI3T1992291 PROC . OVCOLING-92, NA ~ CrES , AUO . 2328,1992 verb in the lexicon . It can be overwritten by specific role information and morphological information with regard to aspect  . For the sake of simplicity in the following we assume that there are just two contrasting aspects corresponding to the main sorts of the upper structure of the events orthierarchy  , the heterogeneous events proper ( ev ) and the honm geneous states ( s t )  . The aspect calculus used is based on ideas fi'om Kritka  ( 1987 ) 2 So , for Peter wrote a book we will get the aspect value ev  , whereas for Peter wrote books we will gets t . For the example (6) we get that e4 , es , el 3 are states , the rest will be analyzed as events proper . 
Aftertile computation of the aspect we come up with an indexed DRS its descrihed iu the second and third section with the value of the aspect feature instantiated  . 
Within the process of anchoring we use several access-functions with respect otheT-list  . Among other things these are act-tel ( T-list ) which gives us the most topicalized item in the list  , the actual referent , el-embedder(T-list , E ) , fb-embedder(T-list , E ) which givous the points elaborations and flashbacks containing E start from  . It has to be stressed that reference vents have to be events proper  . They caunot be states . The actual referent is the first element of the stack  , provided that this element does not cont Mnfl ~hback-or elaboration-embcddings  . If it does we start the recursiv call of the search procedure with respect o the first of these embedded lists  , tenseEl , aspect ( El , and tp ( E ) give us the valnes of tile tense and aspect features  ( sp , ppf , ev , st : simple past , past perfect , event and state ) and the temporal perspective from which E is seen . 
In order to decide the anchoring of new events , the rules of the system make use of three filters  :   ( F1 ) tile tense/aspect filter which decides whether a particular discourse relation is possible with respect o tense and aspect  , ( F2) the " consistency " filter , which decides whether tile choice of a particular discourse relation is logically compatible with the information of the preceding text against the background of tile information from the inference component  ( his consists mainly of testing sort subsumptions ill the context of teml  ) or alin compatibilities between calendar units and event sorts  )  , and ( F3 ) the evidence filter which tries to support the relation tested by means of rules like  ( 9 ) and ( 10 )  . 
To illustrate the system we restrict ourselves to some simple eases  ( compare figure 1 )  . We suppose that the new sentence introduces just one event antiwe only sketch simplified versions of tile rules for continuation  ,  1 . ), for elaboration , 2 . ) , for flashback ,   4 For a detaile description of the calculus refer to Eberle  1991  . 
3 . ), for causally introduced background , 4 . ), for background , 5 . ), for termination of elaborations , 6 . ), and for the termination of flashbacks , 7 . ) . We skip rules which deal with specific subcases of these relations  . 
For instance , we skip rules which deal with dummy referents t introduced by the causal background and rules which allow for more precise temporal localizations of tile new events  . We use rewrite rules which depict the a malgamation fasentence DRS with a text DRS  . 
In rule 1 . ) of figure 1 , (*) reflects the particular case where e ,  . ef is ntember of all elaboration . If it is not , tile corresponding condition in 1( , +1 is omitted . 
Illtile cases 1 . ) - 3 . )  ( F1 ) requires that esisheterogeneous ( aspect ( es ) = ev )  . Tile tense forms of reference-and new event have to be identical  ( tense ( es ) = tense ( e ,  . , l )) . In addition , ( F1) accepts 3 . ), if lense(ere /) = sp and tense(es ) = ppf) . This arrangement allows also for continuation and elaboration on flashback levels and for iteration of flashbacks  . 
For 4 . ) and 5 . ) tile tense forms must be identical . In contrast to 1 . ) - 3 . ), it is required that aspect ( es ) = st . 
( F2) should be clear in all cases . For acceptance , the tested solutious have to be consistent . 
With respectotile cases 1 . ) - 4 . ) , ( F3) accepts the relation tested , if some evidence for this relation can be inferred from the representation f the preceding text on the be~sis of the background knowledge  . Ill addition , in tile cases 1 . ) - 3 . )( F3) also accepts the relation , if evidence for the coml ) eting relations cannot be entailed . Illtile case of tet ~ e(es ) = tense(e, . el ) = ppf , flashback , elaboration and continuation are pairwise competing relations  . Ill the case of tense ( es ) = tense(e , ,~I ) = sp , fl , ' ~ shbaek is ruled out as competing relation with respecto elaboration and e ontinuatiol LIn the case of  5  . ), background , and 3 . ) with tense ( es ) ? tense(e, . eI ) ( F3) is eml)ty . 
Evidence for a particula relation X can be inferred  , if there exists an event sort P which is more general than the event description from DRSs with respect otile events ort hierarchy  , such that tile knowledge base ( KB ) together with the representation of the l ) receding text ( DRS , ) predicts an event e auf type P temporally related to e  ,  . ~ y in a way significant for X , and that KB , DRS , do not entail the corresponding statement with respect o the competing relations of X  . Formally , for instance with respect oX = " e ontinuation " , X is evident , if for P with Ve(ORSs\[es/e\]---*P ( e)) , we can infer that 3 e(P ( e ) Ae , ~ j "-< el , but neither that ~ e(P ( e ) Ae Ce ,   . ~l ) nor 3 e(P ( e ) Ae < e , ef) . 
Tile whole system is implemented in Prolog . So tile order of the rules is important . Thus , we get a preference rlation over the allowed readings  . Continuation is preferred to elaboration which is preferred to flashback  ( ill the case that all alternatives seem possible and that they are supported by  ( F3 ) ) . With respect o6 . ) and 7 . ) , we see that local level expansion is preferred to the anchoring of the new event at AOTESDE  COLING-92  . NANTES , 2328 AO't ~' r1992292 PROC . OFCOLING-92 .

Since the description of e3 , the stop at the bofder . is subsumed by the more general PLACED-AT : sort ,   ( F3 ) -ia the absence of corresl ) onding evidences for the competing relation of continuation-SUl  ) ports " elaboration " . Since for the states e4 , cr , , e13 the al-teHlative of " causally introduced background " is not evident  , they are anchored by means of the rule 5 . ) . 
In the case of e ? and e9 , the fact that evidence for " elaboration " is missing selects for " contimiation '  .

Therefore , with rule 6 . ), we have to climb up the elaboration hierarchy . The anchoring of eT , es , el 1 and el2 should be clear on the basis of what we have said so far  . 
In order to arrive at alternative readings of a text we use a specific backtracking routine which can suppress the impact of  ( F3 ) for the resolution . 
6 Conclusion
The described system complltes the events tru ( : ture of a discourse . Siuce we think that the semantics of tense and aspect is not sufficient to establish tile temporaldls follrsellle all illg  , we use backgl ' ollndkllowledge to ? lisambiguate bt ween different readings  . 
The system is incomplete at present . The fragment it deals with doesn't allow for relative clauses  . In addition the interactioa between NP-resolutlon and temporal resolution is not available  . Some temporally relevant discourse relations are not treated  . The logic tm derlying the preference relation is only rudimentary sketched  . The approach to temporal resolution AcrEs DE COLIN'G-92  , NA UrES , 2328 AOU'T1992293 PROC . OFCOLING-92, NANTES , AUG .  2328 ,   1992 presented here is a condensed version of that suggested in Eberle  ( 1991 )  . The corresponding implementation for the LILOG prototype dates back to  1989  . Meanwhile , independent of this approach , similar suggestions have been made ( cLAs her and Lascarides ( 1991 ) ) . In the work of Asher and Lascarides the underlying theory of nonmonotonic reasoning is MASH  ( cf . Asher and Morreau (1991)) . It is projected to extract a suited proof theory from MASH for the purpose of refining the temporal resolution component suggested  , s
