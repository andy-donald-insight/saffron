In this paper , we describe a program of research designed to explore  . ' how a lexical semantic theory may be exploited for extracting information from corpora suitable for use in Information Retrieval applications  . Unlike with purely statistical collocational analyses  , the framework of a semantic theory allows the ~ ultomatic construction of predictions about semantic relationships among words appearing in coltocatioz ~ alsystems  . We illustrate the at ) proach for the acquisition of lexical information for several classes of nominals  .

: , Introduction ' Fl : e proliferation of online textual information has intensified the search for ctlieient automated in  ( h ; x- . 
ing and retrieval techniques , l " ull-text indexing , in which all the content words in a document are used as keywords  , is one of the most promising of recent automated approaches  , yet its mediocre precision and i'e call characteristics indicate that there is much room for improvement \[ Croft  ,  1989\] . The use of domain knowledge can enhance the el Dctiveness of a full text : ~  ; ystem by providing related ~ erms that can be used lobroaden  , narrow , or retbcus a query at retrieval time ( \[Thompson and Croft 1989\] , \[Anick et al1!)89\] [ l)e-bill et al1988\] . Likewise , domain knowledge may I , e applied at indexing time to do word sense disambiguation \ [ Krovetz & Croft  , 19891 or content analy-~; is\[Jacobs ,  1989\] . Unfortunately , for many domains , ~ mch knowledge , even in the form of a thesaurus , is either not available or is incomplete with respect to the vocabulary of the texts indexed  . 
The tradition in both AI and Library Science has been to handcraft domain knowledge  . , but the cur-b:eut availability of machine-readal ) ledictioimries and large text corpora presents the possibility of deriving at least some domain knowledge via automated procedures\[amsler  , 1980\]\[Maarek and Smadja , 1989\]\[Wilks et al1988\] . The approach describe . d in this paper outlines one such experiment . 
We start with: ( 1 ) a lexicon containing morpho-~yntae tie information for el > proximately  20  , 000 con , -monF mglish words ;   ( 2 ) encodings of English morphological paradigms and a morphological analyzer capable of producing potential citation forms fi'om intlected forms  ;   ( 3 ) a bottom-u parser for recognizing subsentential t ) hrasal constructions ; and ( 4 ) a theory of lexical semantics embodying a collection of powerful semantic princilfles and their syntactic realizations  . 
The aim of our research is to discover what kinds of knowledge can be reliably acquired through tile use of these methods  , exploiting , as they do , general in-guistic knowh ' . dgerather than domain knowledge . In this respect , our program is similar to Zernik's ( 1989 ) work on extracting verb semantics from corpora using lexical categories  . ( ) tar research , however , differs in two respects : first , we employ a more expressive lexical semantics for encoding lexical knowledge  ; and secondly , our focus is on nominals , for both pragmatic and theoretical reasons , l ' ~ or full text information retrieval , information about nominals is pararnomlt , as most queries tend to be expressed as conjunctions O\["t\]O/lllS  . Froll lOll rthc ' oretical perspective , we believe that the c ( mtribution of the lexieal semantics of nominals to the overall structure of the lexicon has been somewhat neglected  ( relative to that of verbs )  \[1 ) ustejovsky and Anick ,  1!:)88\] , \[ Pustejovsky 1989\] . 
Indeed , whereas Zcrnik ( 1989 ) presents metonymy as a pot c~d , i a lobstacle to effective corpus analysis , we beliew : that the exist e , ce of motivated nletonymic structures provides valuable clues for semantic analysis of nouns in a corpus  . 
Our current work attempts to acquire the following kinds of lexical information without domain knowledge : oPart of st  ; eech and morphological paradigms for new words and new uses of old words  ; o Bracketing of noun compounds ; o Subclass relations between nouns ; oLexical semantic ategorization of nouns ; o Clustering of verbs into semantic classes based on the collections of nouns they predicate  . 
While such information is still inadequate for natural language " understanding " systems  , it . vastly simplifies the task of knowledge ngineering  , should one desire to hand code lexical items . Furthernlore , such information can be trot to use directly in full text  1   7 information retrieval systems , fulfilling some of the roles typically played by thesauri and faceted classifications\[Vickery  ,  1975\] . 
2 A \ ]~ amework fo r Lex ica l Semant ics The framework for lexical knowledge we will be assuming is that developed by Pustejovsky  ( 1989 )  , who proposes a theory of lexieal semantics which explores the internal structure of lexical items from a computational perspective  . In this theory , lexical and conceptual decomposition is performed generatively  . 
That is , rather than assuming a fixed set of primitives , we assume a fixed set of rules of composition and generative devices  . Thus , justa . sa formal language is described more in terms of the productions of the gramma rather than in terms of its accompanying vocabulary  , a semantic language should be defined by the rules generating the structures for expressions  , rather than the vocabulary of primitives itself . For this reason , a dictionary of lexical items and the concepts they derive can be viewed a  . sa generative lexicon ) Such a theory of lexical meaning specifies both a general methodology and a specific language for expressing the semantic ontent of lexical items in natural language  . The aspect of this theory most relevant to our own concerns is a language for structuring the semantics of nominals  . Pustejovsky ( 1989 ) calls this the Qualia Structure of a noun , which is essentially a structured representation similar to a verb's argument structure  . This structure specifies four aspects of a noun's meaning : its constituent parts  ; its formal structure ; its purpose and function ( i . e . its Telicrole ); and how it comes about ( i . e . its Agentive role ) . 
For example , book might be represented as containing the following information : book  ( * x * , * y * ) \[Const:in:formation ( * y * ) \]\[ Form : bound-pages ( * x * ) or disk ( * x * ) \]\[ Telic:read ( T , ~ , * y * ) \]\ [ Agentive : artifact ( * x * ) write ( T , z , * y * ) \] This permits us to use the same lexical representation in very different contexts  , where the word seems to refer to different qualia of the noun's meaning  . For example , the sentences in ( 2 ) - ( 3 ) refer to different aspects ( or qualia ) of the general meaning of book . 
1: This book weighs four ounces.
2: John finished a book .
3: This is an interesting book.
Sentence (1) makes reference to the Formal role , while sentence ( 3 ) refers to the Constitutive role . Example (2) , however , can refer to either the Telic or the Agentive aspects given above  . The utility of such knowledge for information retrieval is readily apparent  . This theory claims that noun meaning should make reference to related concepts and the relations into which they enter  . The qualia structure , thus , can I For elaboration on this idea and how it applies to various lexical classes  , see Pustejovsky ( forthcoming ) . 
be viewed as a kind of generic template for structuring this knowledge  . 
To further illustrate how objects cluster according to these dimensions  , we will briefly consider three object types : ( 1 ) containers ( of information )  , e . g . book , tape , record ; (2) instruments , e . g . gun , /Jammer , paint brush ; and (3) figure-ground objects , e . g . door , room , fire place . Because of how their qualia structures differ , these classes appear invastly different grammatical contexts  . 
As with containers in general , information containers permit metonymic extensions between the container and the material contained within it  . Collocations such as those in ( 4 ) through ( 7 ) indicate that this metonymy is gramrnaticalized through specific and systematic head-PP constructions  . 
4: read a book 5: read a story in a book 6: read at a pe 7: read the informatioz ~ onghetape Instruments , on the other hand , display classic agent-instrument causative alternations  , such as those in (8) through ( ll ) . 
8:  . . . smash the wse with the hammer 9: The hammers mashed the wts e . 
10:  . . . kill him with a g~m11: The gunkilled him . 
Finally , figure-ground nominals permit perspective shifts such ms those in  ( 12 ) through ( 15 )  . 212: John painted the door . 
13: John walked through the door.
14: John is scrubbing the fire place.
15: The smoke filled the fire place.
That is , paint and scrub are actions on physical objects while walk through and fill are processes in spaces  . These collocational patterns , we argue , are systematically predictable from the lexical semantics of the noun  , and we term such sets of collocated phrases collocational systems  , a To make this point clearer , let us consider a specific example of a collocational system  . Because of the particular nmtonymy observed for a noun like tape  , we will classify it as a ' container . ' In terms of the se-nmntic representation presented here  , we can view it as a relational noun , with the following qualia structure : tape (* x * , * y * ) \[Const:information ( * y * ) \]\[Form : phys object ( * x * ) \]\[ Telic : hold ( S , * x * , * y * ) \]\[Agent : artifact ( * x * ) ~ write ( T , w , * y * ) \] This simply states that any semantics for tape must logically make reference to the object itself  ( F )  , 2See Pustejovsky and Anick (1988) for details . 
a This relates to Mel'~uk's lexical functions and the syntactic structures they associate with an element  . See Mel'euk (1988) and references therein . Cruse ( 1986 ) discusses the foregrounding and backgronnding of information with respect osimilar examples  . 
82 what it can contain ( C ) , what purpose it serves ( T ) ; and how it arises ( A ) . This provides us with a semantic representation which can capture the multiple perspectives which a single lexical item may assume in different contexts  . Yet , the qualia for a lexical item such a stape are not isolated values for that one word  , but are integrated into a global knowledgeb~tse indicating how these senses relate to other lexical items and their senses  . This is the contribution of inheritance and the hierarchical structuring of knowledge  ( e . g . \[Brachman and Schmolze 1985\] and \[ Bobrow and Winograd 1977\]  )  . In Pustejovsky (1989) , it is suggested that there are two types of relational structures for lexical knowledge  ; at ~ xed inheritance similar to that of an ISA hierarchy  ( cf . Touretsky (1986)) 4 ; and a dymamic structure which operates generatively from the qualia structure of a lexical item to create a relational structure for adhoc categories  . 
Let us suppose then , that in addition to tiletixed relational structures  , our semantics allows us to dynamically create arbitrary concepts through the application of certain transformations to lexical meanings  . For example , for any predicate , Q---e . g . the value of a qualia role--we can generate its opposition  ,  - , Q . By relating these two predicates temporally we can generate the arbitrary transition events for this opposition  . Similarly , by operating over other qualia role values we can generate semantically related concepts  . The set of transformations includes : -~ , negation ,  < , temporal precedence ,  > , temporal succession ,  = , temporal equivalence , and act , an operator adding agency to an argument . 
Intuitively , the space of concepts traversed by the application of such operators will be related expressions in the neighborhood of the original lexical item  . 
We will call this the Projective Conclusion Space of a specific quale for a lexical item  . 5 To return to the example of tape above , the predicates read and copy are related to the Telic value by just such an operation  . 
Predical Le such as mount and dismount , however , are related to the Formal role since they refer to the tape as a physical object alone  . 
It is our view that the approach outlined above for representing lexical knowledge can be put to use in the service of information retrieval tasks  . On the one hand , the projective conclusion space , with its structured assembly of terms , clusterd about a nominal entity , can serve as a " virtual script " , capable of homonym disambiguation ( \[Krovetz1990\] , \[ Culling-ford and Pazzani 1984\] ) and query reformulation . On the other hand , the qualia structure cal ) tures the inherent polysemy of many nouns . In the latter respect , our proposal can be compared to attempts at object classification in information science  . One approach , known as " faceted classification " ( Vickery ( 1975 ) ) proceeds roughly as follows . Collect terms lying within a field . Then , group the terms into facets by assigning them to categories  . Typical examples of 4The , ~aurus-like structures are similar within the Ill . 
community , ef . \[National Library and Information Associations Council  1980\]  . 
5See Pustejovsky (1989) for details.
this are state , property , reaction , device , t lowever , each subject area is likely to have its own sets of categories  , making it ditficult to reuse a set of facet classifications in another domain  .   6 Even if the relational information provided by the qualia structure and inheritance would improve per-%rmance in information retrieval tasks  , one problem still remains ; namely that it would be very time-consuming to hand code such structnres for all nouns in a domain  . Since it is our belief that such representations are generic structures across all domains  , our long term goal is to develop methods \[' or how these relations and values can be automatically extracted from online corpora  . In the section that follows , we describe one such experiment which indicates that the qualia  , ; tructures do , in fact , correlate with collocational systems , thereby allowing us to perform structure-matching operations over corpora to find these relations  . 
3 A Knowledge Acquisition
Procedure
In this section , we outline our procedure for knowledge acquisition  , implemented as part of the LINKS Lexicon/Corpus Management System  . r Steps are illustrated with examples drawn from an analysis done on a Digital Equipnlent Corporation online corpus of  3000 articles containing VMS troubleshooting information  . Briefly , the procedure consists of the foblowing steps . 
1 . Assign nmr phological paradigms to words in the corpus  . 
2 . Generate of a set of bracketed noun compounds , e . g . \[TK50\[tapedrive\]\] , \[\[ datable management \] system\] . 
3 . Collect Nmm Phrases related by preposi-t ions from the collocational systems for the desired lexical items  , e . g . " file on tape ", " format of tape " . 
4 . Hypot : hesize subclass relationships on the basis of collocational information : e  . g . If X and Y are nouns and the phrase XY appears in the corpus  , and there is no phra . se
Y Prep X , then 1 . 5'A(X , Y ) . For example : From \ [ TK50 \[ taped rive\]\] we can predict that ISA ( TK50 , iapedrive ) , lIowever , the potential prediction from " tapedrive " that ISA  ( tape , drive ) is blocked by the existence of phrase , ~ like " tape indrive " . 
5 . Seek distributional verification of subclass relationships  . For each subclass so generated , seek distributional evidence to support tile hypothesis  . That is , is there a " substantial " inter-6This is reflected in the sublanguage work of Clrishman et al  ( 1986 )  , whose automate discovery procedures are aimed at clustering nouns into domain-specific categories like " body part  , " symptom , " etc . 
r This is a system currently under development a Digital Equipment Corporation  . 
3  9 section between verbs collocated with the subclass and superclass terms ?  6  . Attempt semantic classification into a known lexical category  . Try to match the set of syntactic constructions within which X appears with one of our diagnostic on struction sets  . This may involve searching for the set of constructions that contain nouns in other argument positions of the original set of constructions  . For example , the set of expressions involving the word " tape " in the context of its use as a secondary storage device suggests that it fits the container artifact schema of the qualia structure  , with " information " and " file " as its containe es:  ( a ) read information from tape ( b ) write file to tape ( c ) read information on tape ( d ) read tape ( e ) write tape 7 . Use heuristics to cluster predicates that relate to the Telicquale of the noun  . For example , the word " tape " is the object of 34 verbs in our corpus: ( require use unload replace mount restor et ime request control position dismount allocate of f initialize satisfy contain create encounter get alowtry leave beload read write have cause protect upperformenforce copy  ) Among these verbs are some that refer to the formal quale : mount  , dismount and some which refer to tape in its function  , as an information container : read , write , and copy . 
One of the ways to tease these sets apart is to take advantage of the linguistic rule that allows a container to be referred to in place of the contaiuce  , i . e . the container can be used metonymically . The verbs which have " information " ( previously identified as a likely " con-tainee " for tape  ) as an object in the corpus are: ( check include displayenter compare list find get extract set be write fit contain read recreate update return provide specify see open publish give insert have copy take relay lose gather  ) When we intersect heverb sets for " information " and " tape "  , we get a set that reflects the predicates appropriate to the telic role of tape  , a container of information ( plus several empty verbs ) :  ( copy have read contain write be get ) Thus , the metonymy between container and con-tainee allows us to use set intersection to discriminate among predicates referring to the telic vs  . formal roles of the container . 
What results from this acquisition procedure is a kind of minimal faceted analysis for the noun tape  , as illustrated below . 
tape (* x * , * y*)\[Const:information(*y*) , file(*y*)\]\[Form:mount(w , * x *) , dismount(w , * x*)\]\[Telic:read(T , z , * y *) , write(T , z , * y *) , copy(T , z , * y * ) \]\[Agent : artifact ( * x * ) \] To illustrate this procedure on another semantic category  , consider the term " mouse " in its computer artifact sense  . In our corpus , it appears in the object position of the verb " use " in a " use-to " construction  , as well as the object of tile preposition " with " following a transitive verb and its object :  ( a ) use the mouse to set break points ( b ) use the mouse anywhere ( c ) move a window with the mouse ( d ) click on it with tile mouse . . . 
These constructions are symptomatic of its role as an instrument  ; and the VP complement of " to " as well as the VP dominating the " with " PP's identify the telic predicates for the noun  . 
Other verbs , for which " mouse " appears as a direct object are currently defaulted into the for-real role  , resulting in an entry for " mouse " as follows: mouse  ( * x * ) \[ Cont : button ( * x * ) \]\[Form:move ( w , * x *) , click(w , * x *) ~ hold(w , * x*)\]\[Telic:set(*x* , break point ) , move (* x * , window ) , click-on (* x * , window)\]\[Agent:inst(*x*)\]Thus , by bringing together the automatic on-struction of collocational systems with a notion of qualia structure for nouns  , we have arrived at a fairly useful lexical representation for Information Retrieval tasks  . 
4 Discussion
Previous investigators involved in corpus analysis using weak methods have documented limited successes and warned of many pitfalls  ( e . g . 
\[Grishmanelal1986\] and\[Zernik1989\]) . The approach described here differs from previous efforts in its combination of diagnostic collocational systems with a generic target representation for nouns  . While our limited experiments with the acquisition algorithm show some promise  , it is too early to tell how well this approach will do in a larger corpus containing a greater range of senses for terms  . One danger is for the algorithm to be overly optimistic in matching a set of occurrences to a diagnosis  . Given the rampant ambiguity of prepositions and the potential for verb object combinations that  , can spuriously suggest metonymic
I04 relationships , we have found the algorithm as it stands to be too susceptible to jumping to false conclusions  . We are looking to improve precision by increasing our repertoire of both positive and negative diagnostics  , as well as by incorl ) or at-ing information theoretic statistics ( as in Church and t tindle ( 1990 ) ) . 
Likewise , we have been investigating ways to reduce misses -cases in which evidence of relationships between terms known to be related is not detected by our current set  , of heuristics . 
One case in point regards our analysis of " disk " , which we initially expected to be haw ~' similar to " tape " in its telic quale  , t to wever , the intersection of predicate sets for " disk " and " information " yielded the terms  ( copys ; pecify set behave ) Missing are " read and " write " , the relic predicates for tape . This exarn f , lereveal stlw subtleties present in the container nletonylny  . 
Specifically , tlle container can stand in for its contents only in I  , hose situations where one refers to the contents as a whole  . While one lypically " reads " an entire talle , o ~ le usually reads only parts of a disk at a time  . ': Copying " a whole disk is more typical , however , and hence shows u1) in our corpus . Reading and writing still apply to disks ; \] low cvcr , since tllt ' . y do not apply kolislically , we find instead construct . ions with the I ) repositions to and from . e . g . read/write f?om the disk . 
This example il hi ; -tl'atcs the pill ' ails thai arch Mdng if the linguistic rules are too coarse i ~ defined  , but it also shows that such rules are liot domain specific  , an ( lthus , once I ) rol ) (' rly formulated , could function in a general mrposc diagnostic context  . It , renlains an empirical question how well weak method  , , can I ; e employ c ( l to dis--criminate among the quale of a no . n . While this constitutes the primary focus of our current research  , we also I ) elieve that the abo ~ cmelho ( /s complement well other ongoing rcsearc \] liJl the construction of word-disan ~ biguat cd dictionaries  ( e . g . \[m ~, in 1990\]) . 
5 Conclusion
We contend that using lexical semantic methods to guide lexical knowledge acquisition from corpora can yield structured thesaurus-like information in a formamenable for use within information retrieval applications  . The work reported here , though preliminary , illustrates the applicability of this approach for several important cla  . sses of nominals . Future . workim : ludes refining the discovery ! ) rocevlures to reduce misses and false alarms and extending the coverage of the lexical semantics component o allow the testing of such t  . echniques on a greater range of terms . Finally , we intend to at > ply the resulls of the analysis within an experimental infonua-lion retrieval system to test their effectiveness as indexing and retrieval aids  .
