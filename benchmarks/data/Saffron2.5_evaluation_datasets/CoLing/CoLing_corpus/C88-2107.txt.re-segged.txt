2. SYSTEMOVER VIEW
Mehave designed an exporimental instruction system in mathematics  . The system operates in a limited domain : it is capable of solving a restricted class of stoc ~ problems in algebra EOCS soondar ~ Schoo ls in Bulgaria  ( the so ~ alled " number problems " )   . The system accepts non-stylized stor'y prob lems in Bulgarian as they can be Found in mathematical textbooks of a respontaneously Formulated bU the user  . It solves the probl ~ m , and is capable of providing either of the
Following 3 options : ( a ~ Result ( resultant number ( s ) are displayed )   ,   ( b9Equations ( the equation ( s ) to which problems translate are displayed )   . 
( c ) Paraphrases ( one or more " hinting " paraphrases are displayed  , together with the text of the orioinal problem  )  . 
All the three options serve as
CdiF Fecent degrees of ) hinting needed in case the users ( Secondary 5chool pupils ) have probl ~ ms with Finding a solution , Further on , we Focus on problems concerned with the hint ing paraphrastic Facility oF the system  . 
3, GENERAL REQUIREMENTSTOA
HINTING PARAPHRASE
The profit of using a paraphrase , or a " reO ' oreulation " , oF a problem as a , heuristic tool has been emphasized bU researchers in heuristics  , pedagogy and psy~hm logy of education . Nevertheless , such a possibility is usually be q on d the s ~ ope OFi ~ letruction systems  ( 51 eeman , Brushla B2 , We isched slstel IS'TO , PLJ lrnaN 19B ~) , lhe question still remains as to what can count as a hinting pararh ? as a  ( HP )   ( obviously , not ~ paraphrase can serve this purpose equally well  )   . Has * no ourselves on research in mathematical pedagogy and psg cholinguistics  ( since conceptual and linguistic struc tures in this earl  , gage are known to be strono IN general requi rammnts to a HP:i  . The HP should ~ the original problem ( OP ) asr soards the users of the system ( by this wems an simplification Of OP in both conceptual and linguistic aspects with respect to the task assigned  , viz . to fomalise ( -translate into equations ) th ~ OP . 
2 . The HP should be ~ . From the OP ( this requirement is self-evident )   . 
3 . The HP should k_eeep close to the OP From a conceptual and linguistic viewpoi ~ lts  ( this is to ensure that the USers conceive the " sameness " of HP and 

Since the most important task ofth ~ HP is to s implif ~ the translation of verbally fo rmulated problems into equations  ( solving these equations being as a rule wn prob lematic for child rHn  )   , ws took the Following ~ sner alsolution regard in  0 an " appropriats " HP : An " appropriate " HF to a problem is the one that can be  , somewhat metaphorically expressed , liter allu translated i ~ to the respmctive equations of this problem  . 
Obviously , this would , to the greatest extent possible , simplify the OP ( in the sense in which in the translation f rom one NL to another  , the easiest to perform is the literal trans lation \]  . This de ~ ision is further supported by the faot that pupils usually t ~ ans\]  . ate to themselves the OP into intermediary languaoe which is most close to the equations derivable from this problem  . 
~. CONSTRAINTSON " APPROPRIATE " HPs
From what is stated above , a number of specific constraints on the content and form of the HP can be derived  . We briefly mention them below in connection with two of the major decisions that have to be made in a oeneration presses : first  , makin 0 a decisions as to the structure of the HP ( i . o . determin in 0 what and whsn to sag , or an ordered message to be conveyed ) , and , secondly , making a decision as to the y ~ rbal formulat iom of the discourse structure of the HP  ( i . e . 
determin in 0 how to express this in/ormation in Huloar ian  , what syntantic structures to use , what lexemes , etc . )  . 
At the first staos , we should gain in conceptual , and , at these o on d stage , in linouistic simplification , thus approximating the requirement as to the lits ralness we have imposed  . 
~.i . Discourse structure
In the lightoFour aims , it is clear that the discourse structure o ~ the HPs should be standardized  , or ~ , This means that we need not bs concerned ( like most scholars work in ~ on discourse organization  , e . g . Mann 198 ~ , McKs wonstructures of actual texts in the domain oE interest  , but rather with ~ discourse pattern that sat is fies the discourse oo al  . 
Each of the texts in our domain , story problems in a loebra For Secondary 5chools   , is known to be characterized huWi ! known f ~! , ( i . e . what is looked for in the problem ), and ~( i . e . the equation ( s\] , relating the unknown(s\] , or variables , to the given fs ) , or constants , in the problem ) . Some problems also involve ~ uxiliaru ~   ( i0e . further unknown(s ) , often mentioned in the problem formulation somewhat misleadingly  ( e . g .  "  .   .   . Another number is ~ . ~" \ ]  , which have to be manipwlatad ~ but are not themselves part of the solution \]  . 
Yhs discour 58 structure of the HPs , thsreffore , will have to reflect the basic conoeptual constituents of the prohlems : 
I . the unknown(s\]2 . the auxiliary unknown Cs\]<optionally >   3  . the condition(s ) , in bb~partiowl ~ rorder . 
It may be noted that a lot cf problems , as they are formulated in mathematics textbooks  , do not actually satisfy this discourse so hsma : the unknowns are interspersed in the text  , the unknown fs ) and auxiliary unknown ( s\]ar~not sxplioitly discrimisated , the conditions precede ( auxiliary \] unknown ( s )   , etc . 
For instanoe , a typical problem to be found in a textbook maw begin as follows : " The sum of two numbers is B  .   .   . " Clearlu ,   5 tart in 0 the problem formulation hUa condition , instead of with declaring first the unknown  ( s )   , is misleading . Thus , notice that this problem ma~have quited ifferent continuations  , among which .   .   . The first number is 2,
Which is the second ? in which we have justng ~ q~_ unknown  , or .   .   . Their product is 12 . 
What are these numbers ? a version in which there arm two url knowns  . 
The resolution of this local ambiguity requ ires additional i ~ it allectual effort on the part of the pup il j ~ o  . -read Jno , etc . , ~ ircumstances which ou ~ HPs should evade . 
In addition todssoribino the major ' conceptual constituents of the problems ~ in the canonical discourse structuma of the HPs  , the monditions of problems themselves , usuall ~ compound propositio is , should be brok@n_~onarts .

In the sequence follow the propositions desc ~ -ibing conditions 

For example , as a ~' ~ sulto~th ~ analysis of the OF , mentioned in S sc to 5 , the following sequence As obtained :/ equal ( *C+CX , Y ) , 2)  , ~ CV , 5)) equal C-(X , ~) , Y ) unknown(X )
The Canonizer shifts the last proposition unknoen ( X ) at the begining of the sequence of propositions sod adds get another proposition auxiliar ~ unkno~m  ( Y ) 0
As a result unknown ( X ) euxliarg_unknewi ~ fY ) equal ( m ( + ( X , Y ) , 2 )  , ~ CY , 5)) equal ( ~( X , ~)  , V ) is obtained . 
Each compound proposition of the latter type is substituted with an equivalent ~~  . In order to achieve this , alloon stitus nt propositions are substituted buvariablss ~ after " which the simple proposit ion obtained is unified with the compound proposition  . 
In the above case , Erom the unification of the two compound propositions " equal " wlth the simple proposit i on equal  ( ~ , B ) , we obtain : equal C ~ C+C X , V) , ~) , *(Y , 5)) -- equal(~ , B) .

The propositional expression thus describes the ~ of obtaining the compound proposition in question From simple propositions  . 
A Fter the substitution of Bach compound proposition of the equivalent propositional expression  , the folloeing ~ a nonical representation obtains : unknown  ( X ) auxiliar uun known ( Y ) B qu BI ( ~ , B) . C~(r,~)/~,~(Y,S)/B . \[+ fX,Y)IF


The canonical representation used is easilg seen to have certain advantages  . On the one hand , it explicates all computations nso essarg ~ or construction o ~ the so stem of equations  , and , on the other hand , it define sal ~ i_ ~ erball zati_o ! l , to be used b ~ the Generator , in which , First of all , the simple propositions are verbalized , then their verbalizations are 5\] . 0 used i n the verbal izat ion of the compound propositions at the next higher level of his rav ~ hu ~ and so  on0 The text to be obtained ~ ollowing such a plan of verbalization can be literallu translated into a system cf equations bU virtue of the Fact that the text itself is ~ snerat~din inverse order "- From simple to compound proposihions  , 
In the second phase of the process of generation of the HFs  , the oanonical Fo~m of the HPs is translated into Bulgarian text bH the Generator  . The 8enerato ~ o itself is a . ~! l ~" . " ~_~m ~ ( the templates used Fo~generation )?
Each template describes a sgntacti ~ construct i on by means o ~ particular word Forms  , lexi ~ alclasses and variables . 
Some of the templates are used " tO propagate anaphorioal relations Cds finite

As already mention od , the Generator follows the plan For verbalizat ion defined bg the can onlcal representation  . ~set of sIs "' governs the choice of part icular templates  , ~ L ~ uniFi catlon begins . In case of alternatives as to the choice OF a template  , the Generator consults the derivational historg of the analysis  , which is kept in a special register , and selects the template , and the concrete verbal ~ o ~ mulation , used in the OP ( this 8nsuring partial " sameness " of HPs and OPs )  . 
Y he system is implemented in PROLO~-2 and runs on IBMRTs and compatibles . 
7, CONCLUSION
In the paper , we tried to show hoeaparaphrase can be used as a hinting tool in an instruction sg stem in mathematics  , and described as ustee incorporating this fsature  . In the current implementation , the sgstem maggivers as on a blg good paraphrases of the original problem  , but still there is a lot to be desired , even abstracting From an greal application ~ Or educational purposes  . It is a rather difficult thing to make the " right " compromise between the simplific at ion needed in such tasks and anioeverbal phrasing of the problems  . We shall continue the work on there Einemant of the sgstamand on developing an explanation
