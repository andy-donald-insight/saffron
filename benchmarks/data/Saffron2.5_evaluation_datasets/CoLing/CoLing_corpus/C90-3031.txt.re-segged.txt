Our goal is to explore methods for combining structured but incomplete information from dictionaries with the unstructured but more complete information available in corpora for the creation of a bilingual lexical database  . This paper concentrates on the class of action verbs of movement  , and builds on earlier work on lexical correspondences between languages and specific to this verb class  . 
The languages we explore here are English and French  . We first examine the way prototypical verbs of movement are translated in the Collins-Robert  ( Collins 1978 , henceforth CR ) bilingual dictionary . We then analyze the behavior of some of these verbs in a large bilingual corpus  . We take advantage of the results of linguistic research on verb types  ( e . g . Levin , to appear ) coupled with data from machine readable dictionaries to motivate corpus-based text analysis for the purpose of estab-fishing lexical correspondences with the full range of associated translations and then attach frequencies to translations  . 
1 . Background . As NLP systems become more robust , large lexicons are required , providing a wide range of information including syntactic  , semantic , pragmatic , naor phological nd phonological . There are difficulties in constructing these large lexicons  , first in their design , and then in providing them with the necessary and sufficient data  . These problems have recently been the topic of in tense research  ( Klavans 1988 , Boguraev and Briscoe 1989 , Boguraev et al 1989 , Zemick 1990) . Moreover , an important subarea of computational lexicon building that has barely been approached is that of bilingual lexicon construction  ( Caholari and Picchi 1986 , Rizk 1989) . 
2 . Motion Verbs . In this paper , we report on data for movement verbs ( or motion verbs )  . The class of English motion verbs and their translations into Romance languages has been widely discussed from various points of view including theoretical  , structural ( Talmy 1985) , and applied ( Atkins et al 1990 , in preparation ) . English generally incorporates movement and cause or manner into a single lexical item whereas languages like French do not  . For example , in CR stroll is translated as %6 promener nonchalamment ' , ' fl/mer ' and strollin/out etc . as ' entrer/sortir/s'floigners anssepresser ' or ' nonchalammcnt '  . Notice that in French , the translation typically consists of a general motion verb'entrer/sortir/aUer/avancer ' with an adverbial or prepositional modifier show in \[  , manner , e . g . 
' nonchalammcnt'or'sanssepresser ' . Similarly , in English , causation in movement is often incorporated , e . g the Fmglish verb march as into march the troops is translated in CR as ' faire marcher  ( aup as ) lestroupes ' . These multiword correspondences often cause problcms in the lexical transfer component of machine translation systems  . 
3 . Bilingual Corpusbased Analysis . In earlier work ( Klavans and Tzoukermann 1989) , we reported on a study of a sclecl cd subset of movement verb shaa bilingual corpus  . The corpus consists of 85 million English and 95 million French words from the Canadian Parliamentary Proceedings  ( the ttansard corpus )  . Of this , 75 million French and 70 milfion I ; nglish words are aligned by sentence ( Brownctal .  1988) . For example:

Figure One : Sample Ci ~ alion
Somercprescntalive verbs which have at least one movement sense were selected  . We compared the extent of the information found in the bilingual corpus with the information found in the CR machine-readable dictionary  ( MRD )  . For verbs like commute which do not have a straightforward translation  , we found either ( I ) all the components of the verb concept , as in ' serendreautravail quotidiennement ' ; (2) parts of the translation , as in ' fairele trajet ' ; or ( 3 ) a totally different verb from that given in the MRD  , such as ' parcourir ' or ' voyager ' .

In the past , since printed dictionaries have been subject to the constraints of time and space  , they have not always been able to offer full information about entries  , l to wever , with electronic dictionaries and lexical data bases  , this should no longer be a restriction . In fact , given more and richer information , we envision a move away from the flat tfierarchieal structure of dictionaries to a more network-like representation flexical knowledge  . 
4 . R clate ~ lR ~ earch . Combining linguistic and statistical methods is becoming increasingly popular in computational linguistics especially as more corpora become available  .   2 Work in this vein ranges from the syntactic and semantic to the lexical  . For example , Atkins 1987 demonstrates convincingly that with corpus data , the lexicographer can attack the difficult problem of word senses in a systematic way  . 
Church and t tanks 1989 and Church et al 1990 develop a battery of statistical methods to induce linguistic regularities  . They identify coocurrence relations by computing statistics  ( e . g . by use of mutual information , tscore ) over millions of words of text . Their approach is focussed on monolingual rather than bilingual corpus analysis  , and constitutes a significant contribution to lexical research  . On more syntactic note , Dagan and Itai 1990 use statistical methods over linguistically parsed text  ( Jensen 1986 ) to resolve anaphorie reference . 
In the arena of automatic bilingual lexicon construction  , Catizone el : al . 1989 take two corresponding texts ( English and German ) and develop aigoritluns to deternff nelxical alignments by using statistical methods over texts combined with the optional support of an MRD  . In contrast , Sadler 1989 proposes parsing aligned corpora into dependency trees  , which form the structures upon which lexieal correspondences are suggested to the user  . 
The early stages of the construction of the Bilingual Knowledge Base  ( BKB ) rely heavily on human input but gradually becomes more automatic as data is collected  . Using purely statistical techniques , Brown et al 1988 make use of the Itansard bilingual corpus for the purpose of building a machine translation system  . Such a system is a good example of using exclusively statistical nonlinguistic methods to induce translations  . 
5 . The BICORD System-Bilingual Corpusbased Dictionary  . Our approach involves a combination of standard linguistic methodology using MRD's  , enhanced with some statistical techniques . Dictionaries are often discounted because they are built on basis of introspective intuition rather than purely on objective observation of data  . t to wever , our underlying assumption is that the insights that a dict kmary encodes and represent should not be disregarded  ( although there are some limitations re-suiting from the structural organisation  )  . \]' his is a controversials sumption . Even though , in the past , dictionaries havc been built solely on the basis of intuition  , current trends are to use corpus-driven criteria , as , for example , in the Collins COBUILD dictionary (1987) . Without question t iffs is a step in the riglat direction towards completness and accuracy of coverage of the language as it actually occurs  . I to we ver , the limitation of corpus analysis is that subtle linguistic inluitions about word behavior  ( such as " negative vidence " ) cannot be obtained from corpora ; in other words , what is disallowed in the language may never be discovered  . Tiroswed is agree with the claim of Garside , Leech , and Sampson 1987 that the survival of both descriptive and theoretical computational linguistics lies prima -rily in statistical analysis  . We take the more moderate view that both approaches  ( linguistic and statistical ) are essential if the language is to be characterized accurately and in its entirety  . 
We extracted occurrences of several movement verbs  ( called " probe " strings ) from the English side of the Ilansard corpus . The criteria used to ensure that the verb was a member of tiffs semantic class is described in Atkins  , Boguraev and Klavans 1990 ( in preparation ) . The test set of verbs was drift , dance , commute , emigrate , immigrate , ascend , descend , circle , sail and glide . The probe string was used to search in CR ; both for translations and collocations under the entry itself  , and also for French head words in the French side of the dictionary with the probe as a translation  . The extracted corpora , consisting of the set of English citations containing the probe string  ( ha any morphological shape ) and the corresponding French sentence , is called a " probe corpus " . A statistical tagger ( Tzoukermann and Merialdo 1989 ) was used to assign a part of speech to the English side of the corpora  . Translations and collocations were abstracted automatically from the parsed version of CR  ( seeNeff and Boguraev 1989 ) using LQL ( Neff et al 1988 )  . For illustration , a partial entry for dance is : +- bdw:dance+- superhom+-Im~og~aph+-homr  . Jm:2+-pos:v~+-Iransla ~

Probesh ada maximum of 1t 46 citations , with a maximum of 25 senses and collocations in CR ( a rough measure of polysemy )  . 
The tagger used to preprocess the corpus was trained on  1 million words ( about 42 , 000 sentences ) tagged manually and provided by the treebank of Lancaster University  ( Garside , Leech , and Sampson 1987) . Our version has 81 tags , a subset of the treebank tags . Of these tags , 52 are categorial ( such as VV+I for infmitival form of a nonauxiliary verb  ) and 29 are lexically bound , some of the latter being bound to a class of one ( e . g . I0' is for the preposition of ) , and some are bound to a small subclass of category  ( such as PP*S for " personal pronoun subject " )  . Some tags ( such as N+I " singular noun " ) provide morphological information , as well as categorial . The program , based on a tfigram model , computes the probability of a word in relation to its tag and assigns the tag that corresponds to the highest likelihood  . In its simplest form : p ( TIH ) = p ( HIT ImpiT ) that is , the probability of a tag given its word corresponds to the product of the probability of observing the word given its tag by the probability of observing the tag  . By random sampling , we determined the error rate for part of speech tagging to be about  3%  . 
In this way , examples of sample strings as a verb were separated from the nominal uses  . This is the first step in disambiguation , enabling lexical correspondences . To give an idea of size , there were 293 citations ( about 12 , 000 words ) with the string dance in its four morphological forms in English  . 
The distribution by part of speech for these citations is: 
Category Citations Z
VERB 10937
NOUN 17459
AOJ103
The distribution varies by probe ; for example , of the 34024 citations for the string " move " ( and its variants )  , 26218 usages were labelled as verbs (77%) , 7412 as nouns (22%) , and 394(11%) as adjectival .

Data from CR are utilized to drive our first pass at filtering outpre-linked pairs common to both data resources  . Citations that have lexical correspondences already provided by the machine-readable dictionary are extracted from the probe corpus  . For example , consider again the verb dance . Thc character strings in the translation and collocation fields are extracted from CR  ; these strings arc filtered to remove function words and some common words  ( such as ' faire ' ( to make or do )  , morphological variants are generated . Some examples for dance are ' danser/dans a /dansera  . . . , gamba der/gamba dont . . . . ' Probe translations and collocations from CR are then ready to be used to automatically match stmlgs in the French side of the corpus  . Each correspondence that matches one of the MRD probes is removed from the probe corpus  , stored , and counted , leaving a reduced probe corpus . For example , for 109 citations of dance as a verb , 52 sentences matched the MRD correspondences , as shown in Figure One . An extended lexicon can then be built , using the structure already provided by CR where the frequencies are computed over these matches  . For example , an initial partial enhanced entry for dance is : +-hda:dance?-superhom

For example , an additional node is added to the MRD structure to in-sort danser since danser is a translation both in homograph  2 and in homograph 3  . Since transitivity of a verb cannot be determined automatically  , there is no evidence to rnotivate placement so the data is inserted high in the tree  , at the homograph level . In contrast , ' gambader ' and's autiUer'm'e always intransitive  ( as determined by a lookup in CR )  , so they can be automatically placed under homograph three  . Notice also that corpus derived information is placed under the relevant d_collocator ' gambad cr ' and's autiller ' since these are cases where matches occun'ed on the targeter m  , but the source is different . 
The \] lansard , being the Canadian Parliamentary proceedings , contains a number of juridical and parliamentary terms  , usages , and structures , a typical feature of any sublanguage . However the tlexi ~ bility inherent in the BICORD system woukt allow a repetition of the sarne process over different sub  . .
languages . As other texts are used , frequencies can be updaled in two ways , by counting all tiequencies into a general score , and also by keeping separate li'equencies linked to the source text  . This feature allows a representation of the lexical correspondences of general and specific texts in one data strucolure  . It also permits comparison between sublanguages . The result would be a balanced lexio conbuilt over a balanced variety of corpora to re-lect the actual uses of the words or phrases in context  . 
Further analysis of the remaining probe corpus is pursued by observing cooccurences both over tags and lexical items  . For example , with dance , looking at immediate rate right context over tags reveals verb-prepatterns : 
VERB CATEGORY % clarkepr ~ p 77 darmeotl-mr 22 Moving from tag cooecurences to lexical items , the majority of these cases are for the preposition to  . 
Including coocurrences over a larger window of five words  , idioms are revealed like dance to . . . tune , which is not found in CR , either undertune or dance . These and other patterns cmabe discovered by statistical analysis over tags and lexical items it \] the reduced probe corpora  . Therefore , a new set of collocations can be inserted in the lexicon  ; an entry for " dance " enhanced furl . her is shown as follows : +- h < ~ . : dance

I .  ?  , conversely , to enhance a statistical system with data from an Mill  . ) . The first application can be viewed in the light of a lexicographer's workstation  ; it can also be viewed as a contribution to the choice of lexical item made by the component responsible for lexical transfcr in a machine translation system  . 
Translations and collocations in the original MRD are ordered by frequency  , orderings which can easily be updated depending on the sublanguage corpus  . 
The enhanced MRD is more complete in containing correspondences not found in the original dictionary  , and in suggesting new statistically significant translations  . As for the second type of application , systems such as described in Brown et al 1988 which use purely statistical approaches to infer translations from a bilingual corpus can benefit di ~ rectly from the information already given in the MRD  . This information can be used to preset values in the computation of correspondences  , rather than letting the system learn values " already discovered  . 
Future work depends on testing these two applications  , namely that MRD-based lexieal transfer will proceed more accurately given statistical information and that statistical implementations  , given enhanced Mill ) data , will demonstrate improved perlormance in determining lexical correspondences  .

It is not always the case that the remaining corpus data can be easily inserted in the lexicon and in fact  , we encountered a few problems during this process . 
First , it is not straightforward to ~ a ow with which field to associate the resulting correspondences  . For example , indance , does dance around go under a separate translation field or is it related to the collocation field with dance about ? Second  , some new context fields should be added to the collocation nodes  , but determining the criteriat br selecting them automatically is not always evident  . 
Further , there is a question of locating and integrating robust new data from the corpus into the already existing structure  .
