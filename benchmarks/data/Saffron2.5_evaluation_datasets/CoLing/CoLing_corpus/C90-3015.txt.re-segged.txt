Transformational grammars and " synthesis - by-rule " Most current text-to-speech systems  ( e . g . Allen et al1987; Hertz 1981~1982 , forthcoming ; HertzetaL 1985) are , at heart , unconstrained string-based transformational grammars  . Generally , text-to-speech programs are implemented as the composition of three non-invertible mappings :  1  . grapheme to phoneme mapping ( inverse spelling rales + exceptions dictionary )  2 . phoneme to all ophone mapping ( pronunciation rules )  3 . all ophone to parameter mapping ( interpolation rules )  \] ) ' or example : ph\]% , pit\[p'\]~--/p/~--sip\[p-\]e/spit allophones ~ phonemes  , --- graphemes h denote strong release of breath ( aspiration ) ' denotes light/weak aspiration-denotes no aspiration These mappings are usually defined using rules of the form A-+B/UDe  . g .  (1) , usually called " context-sensitive " , but which in fact define unrestricted rewriting systems  , since B may be the empty string ( Gazdar1 . 987) . It should be recalled that " if all we can say about a grammar of a natural anguage is that it is an unrestricted rewriting system  , we have said nothing of any interest " ( Chomsky 1963:360 )  . 
(1) p-- , p-/s __ else p-- , ph /__ V ( where V is any vowel symbol ) else p--~p ' Often , of course , grammars made with rules of this type may be ( contingently ) quite restricted . For in . -stance , if the rules apply in a fixed order without cyclicity  , they may be compiled into a finite-state transducer  ( Johnson 1972 )  . But in general there is no guarantee that a program which implements such a grammar will halt  . This would be pretty disastrous in speech recognition  , and is undesirable even in generation-based applications  , such as text-to-speech . However , this has not prevented the at > pearance of a number of " linguistic rule compilers " such as Van Leenwen's  ( 1987 , 1989) and Hertz'ssys . -gems . 
Tile basic operations of a transformational gram ? mar--deletion  , insertion , permutation , and copying -- are apparently empirically instantiated by such well-established phonological phenemonase lision  , epen thesis , metathesis , assimilation and coarticula-tion .

Deletion : Elision e.g . sandwich\[sanwitf\]

Permutation : Metathesis e.g . burnt\[brunt\]

The problems inherent in this approach are many : 1  . Deletion rules can make Context-Se , lsitive grammars undecidable . ( Salomaa 1973:83 , Levelt 1976:243 , Lapointe 1977:228 , 
Berwick and Weinberg 1984:127) 2 . Non-monotonicity m~kes for computational complexity  . 
3 . There is no principled 1 way of limiting the domain of rule application to specific linguistic domains  , such as syllables . 
4 . Using sequences as data structures is really only plausible if all speech parameters change with nlore-or-less equal regularity  .

Numerou such " constraints " and ~ principles " have been proposed  , such as the Well-Formedness Condition ( Goldsmith 1976 and several subsequent for-nmlations )  , the Obligatory Contour Principle ( Leben 1973) , Cyclicity ( Kaisse and Shaw 1985 , Kiparsky 1985) , Structure-Preservation ( Kiparsky 1985) , the Elsewhere Condition ( Kiparsky 1973) etc . While this line of research is in some respects conceptually cleaner than primitive transformational grammars  , there has been no demonstration that a " principle'-based phonology is indeed more restrictive than primitive transformational phonology in any compu-rationally relevant dimension  . 
A declarative model of speech For the last few years  , I have been developing a " synthesis-by-rule " program which does not employ such string-to -string transformations  ( Coleman and Local 1987 forthcoming ; Local 1989 forthcoming ; Coleman 1989) . 
The basic hypothesis of this ( and related ) research is that there is a tradeoff between the richness of the rule component and the richness of the representations  ( Anderson 1985 )  . According to this hypothesis , the reason why transformational phonology needs to use transformations is because its data structure  , strings , is too simple . Consequently , it ought to be possible to considerably simplify or even completely eliminate the transformational rule component by using more elaborated at a structures than just well-ordered sequences of letters or feature-vectors  . For instance if we use graphs fig . 1) to represent phonological objects , then instead of copying , we can im-

: ( n corpora ~ ing richer data structures allows many if not all rewriting rules to be abandoned  , to the extent J~hat the transformational rewrite -rule mechanism can be ditched  , along with the problems it brings . 
Consider how the " processes " discussed above can be given a declarative  ( or " configurational " ) analysis . 
All ophony can be regarded as the different interpretation of t : he same element in different structural con-~exts  , rather than as involving several slightly different phonological objects instantiating each phoneme  . 
Onset Coda Onsetii/\ppsp\[ph\]\[p , \]\[p\]
Aspirated Slightly Unaspirated aspirated Assimilation can also be modelled non -destructively by unification  ( fig .  2) . 
Coarticulation is simple to model if parametric phonetic representations may be glued together in parallel  , rather than simply concatenated . Consonants may then overlaid over vowels , rather than simply concatenated to them ( Ohman \]966 , Perkell 1969 , Gay 1977 , Mattingly 1981 , Fowler 1983) . If required , ~his analysis can also be implemented in the phonological component  , using graphs of the ' overlap ' relation ( Griffen 1985 , Bird and Klein 1990): e . g . : iitiLlaa/\/\/\kpkIkt

It has been demonstrated ( Fourakis 1980 , Kelly and Local 1989 ) that epen the tic elements are not phonet-ically identical to similar non-epenthetic elements  . 
The transformational analysis , however , holds that the phonetic implementation fa segment is depen-dendent on its features  , not its derivatonal history ( '%\[t\]isaIt\]isaIt\]' )  , and thus incorrectly predicts that an epenthetic \[ t \] should be phonetically identi-ca  . 1 to any other It\] . 
Elision is the inverse of epen thesis , and is thus in some sense " the same " phenomenon  , taking the " un-elided ': form as more primitive than the " elided " form  , a decision which is entirely meaningless in the declarative account  ( fig .  4 )   Metathesi3 is another instance of " the same " phenomenon i . e . different temporal synchronisation of an invariant set of elements  . Epen thesis , Elision and Metathesis may all be regarded as instances of the more general phenomenon of non -significant variability ill the timing of parallel events  .

As well as these relatively low-level phonological phenomena  , work in Metrical Phonology ( Church 1985 ) and Dependency Phonology ( Anderson and Jones 1974 ) has shown how stress assignment , a paradigm example for transformational phonology  , can be given a declarative analysis . 
Overview of text-to-parameter conversion in the York Talk system  1  . Each symbol in the input text string is translated into a column-vector of distinctive phonetic features  ( nasal , vowel , tongue-back , etc . ) Sequences of letters are thus translated into sequences of feature-structures  . 
2. The sequence of feature-structures is parsed.
This process translates the sequence into a directed graph representing the phonological constituent structure of the utterance  . 
3 . The phonological structure is traversed and an interpretation function applied at each node to derive a phonetic parameter matrix  . 
Parsing is done using a Phrase Structure Grammar of phoneme strings  . A very simplified version of such a grammar is fig  .  5 . I have implemented several such grammar so far , including a DCG implementation and a PATR-II-like implementation  . With one or two simple extensions to the grammar formalism  , it is also possible to parser eent rant ( e . g . ambisyllabic ) structures and other overlapping structures , such as those arising from bracketting " paradoxes "  . The re-suiting graphs are thus not trees , but directed acyclic graphs . 
In computational syntactic theory , one of the main uses for the parse tree of a string is to direct the construction of a compositional  ( Fregean ) semantic interpretation , according to the rule-to-rule hypothesis ( Bach 1976 )  . In the York Talk system , the same approach is employed to assign a phonetic interpretation to the phonological representation  . A second , theory-internal motivation for constructing rich parse-graphs of the phonemic string is that it enables the phoneme string to be discarded completely  , thus liberating the phonetic interpretation function from the sequentiality and other undesirable properties of seglnental strings  . 
After the phonological graph has been constructed by the parser  , a head-first graph-travers all gorithm maps the ( partial ) phonological category of each node into equations describing the time-dependent motion of the synthesis parameters for specified in-telwals of time  . These parametric time-functions are finally instantiated with actual numbers representing times  , in order to derive a complete matrix of ( parameter , value ) pairs . 
As well as being computationally " clean " , this method of synthesis has the additional merit of being genuinely non-segmental in  ( at least ) two respects : there are no segments in the phonological representations  , and there is no cross-parametric segmentation in the phonetic representations  . The resulting speech does not manifest the discontinuities and rapid cross-parametric hanges which often cause clicks  , pops , and the other disfiuencies which typify some synthetic speech  . On the contrary , the speech is fluent , articulate and very humanlike . When the model is wrong in some respect , it sounds like a speaker of a different language or dialect  , or someone with dysfluent speech . For all these reasons , the York-Talk model is attracting considerable interest in the speech technlogy industry and research commulfity  , a circumstance which I hope will promote a widespread change of approach to computational phonology in future  .
