This is tile Di Slmt cher-Based ( DB ) approach . The B ( )S approach involves more processing bill ~ lllows an  ,  . 7 posreriori selection of the best results . Tile DB approach saves cycles but relies on heuristic  , , . , priori selection of the best oul put .

hiw hatlk-dlows we hrielly describe our lirst experiment with tile B  ( )S approach and discuss tile requirements for tile DB approach  . 
2. The Best Output Segment Apprtmch to
Adaptlvity ( ) ur B ( )S Itpproach experiment was cmried out lor a Spanish-English Iranslation sel-uF  , in the fran/ework of I he Pangloss MT project ( F ' angloss , 1994) and used Ihrce . MT engines--KBMT , EBMT , and TBMT . 
Tile KBMT engine we used wastile . main line engine of tile Pangh . /s system , alradilional KBMT environment described in some detail in  ( Pangloss ,  1994) . It was important fortile BOS experiment that this engine genernlcd an internal quality rating for each OU tlmt segment it produced  . 
The tmsic idea of EBMT ix simple ( cf . Nagao , 19 g 4 ) : an input passage S is comlmred with the sourcc-I : m guage " side " of a bilingual exlarchive  , where lexl passages are slored witll their Iransllitions ill  ( ) It flu'gel langtmge ( or a set of such )  . TIle " closesl " matcll , passage S' is selecled and lhel ranslation of lhisclos ' astmalch  , the passage 7" is accepled a stile Iranslali On of S . Our EBM Tengine i is cda 100MB bilingual Spmfish-English archive of UN cdti -cial documents  , hip reparation fc , r processir ~ g , die archive was idigned attile sentence level . Tilelnal ching of input passages with the Spanish side of the archive was allowed to be inexact  . Penalties were assessed for omitted and ex-Ira words  , word occurrences ill different r nor phological forms and differences in word order  .

Our transfer systen l was very simple . It was Ilascdondirect Icxical substitution fo English words and phrases for Spanish words and phrase  , for lilied wilh n/or pholog-ical analysis at/d synlhesis modifies  . Tile process relied on iitltllll ber of dalabases -itSlmnish-English MRD  , lhelexicons used by ll/eKBMT engine , a large sel of user-generated bilingual glossaries as well as agltzetleer and It list of proper and orglll/izaliOll names  . The user-gerler . : llcd glossaries for our experiment corllained aboul  174  , 000 entries .

2.1. Combining Results
The crux of tile B () Smelhod is combining , results from in divhlual engines . A clmrl data strll Clt lr cwil ~ Itge ( \] tOCOlll bincresellsl\]t ) liiIhc individual engines . B cl bre the l ranshffion process , the edges of lhech art were made to correspond to in divkhml words in the input  . New edges are added It ) the ch:lrltil rougtl tile operation of the throe MT erlgines labeled wilhtim I rans ration of a scgmen I of tile in pulsiring and indexed hyth is segment's heginning and end positions  . The KBM'I\[and EBMT engines also carried a quality score for each ioul pule lemenl  . 
After all lima engines finished their workilis lleC  ( b ; - ~0 cover the input string as densely as possible ( so I hat there is a Irai islalion for a kI\]la I/y source lexl elements as possil '  , le ) ; b ) use the " hesl " of lheavailable candit lales . 
q ~' ~ lind the best candidates three heuristics were used a  ) intern'dquatily ratings produced by the KP , MT and EBMT engines ; h ) stalic relative qu ; dity assessmcnl of the protitular engines wcused and c  ) the length of lhetranslation segment ( the longer , I he hetter ) . Enhancing lhequality of lhese hemistics antl generally tinding more Sol  ) hislicated ways of combining timlings of individual engines is the most important direction of improven lenlo follr BOS system  . 
The chart walk algorithm l ) roducing the final result of lheB ( )S system used lhe above heuristics . The algorilhm uses dynamic programming to lind the Ol~linm I cover  ( a cover with the best cnm tllative score )  , a SS\]lining correct component qualily scores .   11 ixd cscrihed in some detail and illustral cd in Nirenhurg and l:rcd crking  , 1994 and Frederking an ( I Nirenburg , sttl , tfftted .
