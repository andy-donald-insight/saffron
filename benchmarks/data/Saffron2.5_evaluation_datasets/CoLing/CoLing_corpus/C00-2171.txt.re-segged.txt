1 Introduction
This paper describes a framework for multilingual inheritance-based lexical representation which a P lows sharing of information across  ( related ) hm-guages at all levels of linguistic description  . Most work on multilingual lexicons up to now has assumed mouolingual lexicons linked only at the level of semantics  ( MUI_TILEX 1993 ; Copestak et al . 
1992) . Cahill and Gazdar ( 1999 ) show that this approach might be appropriate for unrelated languages  , as for example English and Japanese , but that it makes it impossible to capture useful generalisations about related languages-such as English and German  . Related languages share many linguistic characteristics at all levels of description - syntax  , morphology , phonology , etc . -not just semantics . For instance , words which comefl'om a single root have very similar orthographic and phonological forms  . Compare English , Dutch , and German1: I The lranscriptions are taken from CELEX ( Baayen et al 1995 ) and usetile SAMPA phonetic alphabet ( Wells 1989 )  . 
Dutch Gernmnbed Bett/bEt // bEt/ribRippe / rip//rip@/handltand/hAnt / / hant/kat Katze/kAt//kats@/Most differences can be attributed to dil'ferent orthographic conventions and regular phonological changes  ( e . g . final devoicing in Dutch and German ) . 
The English/I , the Dutch/AI , and the German/a/in the last two exmnples , are even virtually the same . 
They have slightly different realisations but they are phonologically non-distinctive  , i . e . if the Dutch/A/were substituted by the English / /in Dutch  , the result would not be a different word , but it would simply sound like a different accent . 
Cahill and Gazdar ( I999 ) describe an architecture for nmltilingual lexicons which aims to encode and exploit lexical similarities between closely related languages  . This architecture has been successfully applied in the PolyLex project  2 to define a trilingual lexicon for Dutch , English , and German sharing morphological , phonological , and lnorphophono-logical information between these languages  . 
in this paper , we will take the Polykex fiame-work as our basis . We will focus on the phonological similarities between related hmguages and we will extend the PolyLex approach by capturing crosslinguistic phoneme correspondences  , such as the//-/A/-/a/correspondence mentioned above  3  . 
First , we will discuss how a phoneme inventory can be defined for a group of languages-l  ) utch , 2 http://www . cogs . susx . ac . uk/lab/nlp/polylex / 3We believe the approach would be even more beneficial if exlended to a featura level  , but for tile present purposes we conline ourselves to the segmental level  .

2 A Metaphoneme Inventory
In this section we describe how a phoneme inventory can be defined for a group of languages in which language-specific phonemes flmction its " allophones " of newly defined metaphonemes  . We will restrict ourselves to the vowel phonemes of l  ) utch , English , and Gerlnan . If we know , for example , that words which are realised with an/I in English are usually realised with an/A/in I  ) utch , and an/a/in German ( as in hand/hnd/versus/hAnt/w:rsus/hant / , cal/kt/versus/kArl versus/kats(@/ , elc . ) , we might be able to generalise over these three hm guage-specific phonemes and introduce a meta -phoneme  , e . g . IAa \], which captures this generalisation . 
To give an impression of the distribution of the different vowel phonemes across l  ) utch , English , and German , their vowel charts ( K6nig and van der Auwera 1994 ; Wells 1989 ) were merged into one big vowel chart containing all the vowel phonemes of these three hmguages  . 4, The resulting charis given iutigure 15:

anything about crosslinguistic phoneme correspon -deuces  . Knowing that Dutch and German both have a phoneme / o:/  , does not mean that they are crosslinguistically non-distinctive  . 
qbfind crosslinguistic phoneme correspon-deuces , we followed O'Connor's ( 1973 ) strategy for establishing phonelne conespondences between difl'erent accents  , identifying phonemes of one accent with those el ' another : " How are we to decide whether to equate phoneme X with phoneme A or with phoneme D ? We can do so only on the basisel ' the words in which they occur : if X and A both occur in a large number of words common to both accents we link them together as representing the same point on the pattern  , if , on the other hand , X shares more words with D than with A , we link X and D .  \[ . . . \] Evenso , if X and D occur in a very similar word set and X and A do not  , then it is much more revealing to equate X and D than X and A  . "( O'Connor 1973, p .  186 ) We extended O'Connor'strategy and applied it to a group of  ( closely ) related hmguage sharing a colnmou word stock- in our case a sllb set of the West Gmmanic language sharing worcls with a common Germanic origin  . We compiled a list of g00 ( mono - and disyllabic ) Germanicognates , looked up the transcriptions in the CELEX database  ( Baayenelal .  1995) , and then mapped words con-tainiug a palticular vowel in one hmguage onto its cognates in the other two hmguages to see how this particular vowel was realised in tile other two languages  . This process was repeated for all the vowels , for all three languages . 
A few examples of tile results we obtained for English vowels are included below c '  . 
As can be seen fl ' om these v , tlaere is some variation in the closeness of the correspondences  . The vowel set //-/ A /-/ a / , as we anticipated at the outset , does turn out to be a wflid correspondence . The set associated with English / i :/ , on the other hand , is less clearcut , as there are several possible cor-r'The remaining correspondence tables are available at http:/ / www  , it ri . bton . ac . uk/~Carole .

sophisticated analysis , phonological and phonotactic information would need to be considered as well  . 
Howcvel ; even at the present level of analysis , the metaphoneme principle can be helpful in the multilingual lexical structure proposed  , as we now dis-

3 The mul t i l i ngua l inher i tance l ex icon In this section  , we will explore the sharing of phonological information in the lexical entries of a multilingual inheritance-based lexicon  . We focus on phonology rather than orthography as phonology is nearer to primary language use  ( i . e . spoken language ) , it can be used as input for hyphenation rules , spelling correction , and it is essential as the level of symbolic representation for speech synthesis  ( MUD
TILEX 1993).

We will take the multilingual architecture of PolyLex as our starting point  . First , we will describe the PolyLexar claitecture . Then , we will show how phonological information can be shared in the lexical entries  . 
PolyLex detines a multilingual inheritance-based lexicon for l  ) utch , English and German . It is implemented in DATR , an inheritance-based lexical knowledge representation formalism  ( Evans and Gazdar 1996 )  . The rationale of inheritance-based lexicons requires information to be pushed as far up the hierarchy as it can go  , generalising as much as possible . In a multilingua lexicon , this means that information which is common to several anguages is stated at higher points in the hierarchy than that which is unique to just one of the languages  . In addition , Polykex makes use of orthogonal multiple inheritance which allows a node in the hierarchy to inherit different kinds of information  ( e . g . semantics , morphology , phonology , syntax)fi'om different parent nodes . In this papen we are just interested in the phonological hierarchy  . 
Polykex assumes a contemporary phonological fralne work in which all lexical entries are detined as having a phonological structure consisting of a sequence of structured syllables  , a syllable consisting o1' a nonset ( the initial consonant cluster , which might be split up into on set 1 , on set 2 , etc . ) and arhylne . The rhyme consists of a peak ( the vowel ) and a coda ( the final consonant cluster , which might b c split up into coda1 , coda2 , etc . ) . This structure is defined at the top el ' the hierarchy  , and applies by defaul to all words . Only the relevant values for onset , peal < , and coda have to be defined at the individual exical entries  ( see Cahill and Gazdar1! ) 97 )  . Following PolyLex we will concentrate on a segmental phonelnic representation  . An example of the lexical entry gramas it would be represented in 
PolyLex , is shown in figure 2.
The multilingual phonological entry for gram , is delined by sharing identical segments occnrring in the majority of the language -specific entries  ( /grm / -/ xrAm / -/ gram / )  . That is , onset1 is / g/ , on set 2 is /1"/ , and codais/m / . 
English and German can inherit all the information fiom the common part except for the value of their peak  , which is respectively // and / a / . In Dutch , the value of the peak has to be specified as being / A/  , plus we will have to override the w due for the first onse to get\[xrAm\]  . 
This example misses the generalisation that the

For each lexical ca-try where English uses // , l ) ut ch / A/ , and German / a / , the value for peak has to be specitied in the language-specific parts  . By using the metaphoneme IA al instead , this information needs to be specified only once . The resulting multilingual phonemic representation for gram is given in ligure  3  .

Figure 3: A multilingual inheritance lexicon with i Y let a phonelne SAll the information has now been pushed up as far as it can go  , capturing as many generalisations as possible . The information that \] A a \] results illan // in English  , an / A / in Dutch , and an/a/inGerman is specified only at the top level  . The language-specitic boxes are almost empty , except for the value of the first on set in Dutch . The reason for this is that as yet we have only defined crosslinguistic phoneme correspondences for vowels  , not for consonants . We do , howevm , suspect that the Dutch/x/is phonologically non -distinctive fi ' om the German and English / g/  . Further research defining crosslinguistic phoneme correspondences for consonants It is a fundamental feature of this account that the inherited information is only default information which can be overridden  . Thus , it is not required that metaphoneme correspondences are complete and we may choose to use a metaphoneme even if one of the languages uses a different vowel in some words  . The definitions can be overridden in exactly the same way as the onset definition in Dutch in the example above  . So if we consider the vowel correspondences in table  1  , we can see that of the 35 words which have cognates in all three languages ,   27 can be defined as having the meta-phoneme\[AaI in the common lexical entry  ( those for which both English and l ) ut ch have the corresponding vowels )  . Five of these will require a separate vowel defined for Gerlnan  , while the remainder will need separate vowel definitions for all three languages  . 
Given this , we can see that economy of representation can be achieved even in cases where the vowel correspondences are far from conclusive  . 
Even if only half or fewer of the Dutch words , for example , have the same vowel in cognates for which the English words have the same vowel  , this still means that those half can be defined without the need for the language-specific vowel to be defined  . 
Another feature of the metaphoneme principle that differentiates it from the phonemic principle is that there is no requirement for biuniqueness  . 
A phoneme in a language can be a realisation of morn than one metaphoneme  . This means that we can define a metaphoneme IA a\ [ as well as another  , IA : Aal . Each of these will then be used in different common lexical entries  . This can be used as an alternative to phonological/phonotactic conditioning or in addition to it  , for just those cases where there is more than one correspondence but no obvious phonologicai /phonotactic onditioning for the decision between phonemes  . 
4 Conclusion
In this paper , we have discussed the concept of metaphonemes . Metaphonemes are crosslinguistic phoneme correspondences such as the English //  , the Dutch/A/ , and the German/a/correspondence in entioned above . At the l nultilingual level , the realisation of the metaphoneme is conditioned by the choice of language  . At the lower monolingual level its realisation as an all ophone of a particular phoneme is conditioned by the phonological envi-romnent  . As such , a metaphoneme is a generalisation of a generalisation  . 
We have shown how a metaphoneme inventory can be defined for a group of languages and that incorporating these crosslinguistic phoneme correspondences in a multilingual inheritance lexicon increases the number of generalisations that can be captured  . Calculations on the syllable inventories of Dutch  , English , and German in the CELEX database show that the introduction of metaphonemes increases the amount of sharing at the syllable level by about  25%  . 
Another benefit of introducing metaphonemes is improved robustness in NLP systems  . Knowledge about crosslinguistic ommonalities can help to provide grounds for making an " intelligent " guess when a lexical item for a particular language is not present  . 
Tiffs research as concentrated on crosslinguistic vowel phoneme correspondences  . Similar research will be done for consonants .
