Abstract
C , honasky's proposition that language is handled hy a language-specific laeulty needs more just iieation  . In language acquisition illi ) artieular , it is still in question whether the faculty is necessary or aot  . We succeeded in explaining one e on strainloil language acquisition in terms of a general earning mechanism  . 
This paper describes a machine learning system Rhea applied to the domain of language acquisition and shows that Rheacall learn the tendency which children confronting lie '  , ' , ' wordsSeelll tol lave . 
1 Introduction
Chomsky proposed that language is handled by a language specilic faculty  , but this proposition has not been verified , especially ill the area of language acquisili ( : ) n . Although Berwick\[1\] showed tile existence of a special nlechan is nl sulfirielfl for the learning of syntax  , there is still a question of whether or not the I llecha  . tllsl BiSlle Cessary , l ? lll " - therlnore , his model does not explain acquisition of set nantic soreonce p is  . These were simply presupposed . 
We started frolnage imralk ! arning mecha-niSlll alld succeeded ill explainiug a constraint on language acquisition  . 
Children learld ng their ill'st language face and solve a big prol  ) hun of induction . They lind ( : ) lit\]lOW words & l'eased all ( \]  ) ' elated Ic , other words from liln i ( edinformal \ [ on at a surprising lyra . pidrate . Illtim fie M of ( leveli ) p mental psychology , many kinds of constraints have been proposed to accounl for this I > he nonten  ( m . Most of these constraints ( : olne froln the view that assunles a specific fl ' anle work far language acquisition  , but there is alt other view : language as an extension of other intellectua J faculties  , and its acquisition as one resnlt of the universal learning process that leads to  ( mracquisition of intellect . 
We want to explain the children's ability ill terms of tile latter view  . '\[' hus , we make a machine learning systen l , Rhea , which arc epts n-luple ill plltSelms\[sting of instances froln it  . 
donlains ( one from each ( Ionla Jn ) and creates the rules that delilnil the imssibh , to rah\[nations .

Chil ( lren seen l to ( : onsJder the assunl pli Oll of taxonolni ( " organization . Markntan's experiment shows thai even though they are liahle to consider thematic relations in dmnains other than language acquisition  , children hearing a new word attend Io taxonomic relations  . This tendency is called the " setting for ' new words "  . 
It is / totcleat ' , however , if such constraints are innate or not , or more essentially if they call he derived froln restri <` tio as thaially intelligent system should observe  . One way to <`\] arify this point is to examine whether tit  (  , model that does not contain the constraint can acquire it during the learning process  . 
8 An overview of Rhea 3 . 1 Rhea as a machine learning sys-tem Fig . 1 i l lustrates Rhea's learning process in two dif \[erent domains  , A and B . The system's task is to find general rules that predict which instance from l  ) olltain A can at ( pear with a certain in stal'teefrontB , and vice versa . 
Rhea accepts as input a\[ ) air of instances i = ( a , b ) . One instance is fronll ) omain Aan ( 1 the other front l ) omain B . One pair is given at a time . Rhea is equipped with an internal representation language for each domain  , D . 4 and De , and has predelined methods to extend the repro -sentation languages in case of nee  ( l . Sindlarities , generalization operations and specialization operations are defined upone a <  , h language . Rheare presents all input pair using these languages and their extensions  , antimakes all internal ' et-resentation D ( i )  -  ( 1 ) A ( a )  , D e ( b) , which is a pab " of a representation of " I ) olnain A instan ( : eatt ( I that of al ) omaillH instance . More tha . ll one possible internal representation may exist for one input  , but the one found first is stored . 
When represelltations are acctHlflulated , Rhea is able to find out rules , htirst sorts intert ~ alrepresentations into classes based on similarities  . 
Classes nlay or may not overlap . Then R heagener alizes representations of ' each ( ' lass . This process of < ` lassili ( ' ation adgeneralizatiol ~ is , done oil demand . 
When a partial input ,   ( an instan<`e frot nl ) o-main A ) is given and its < ` otlnterpart b ( front l ) on mizlB ) is to hepred lcte ( I , tilt , n to del first ( : lasstiles the partial input is leaclass N using tlt  ( ' infol'nlalion about a , makes the gelmra Liz ; ltion of l ) omainlpart ttf all the other relt resentalions ill <'\] ass : '  , : and expects one of its spe ( ' ializalions to heb's rt , presentalion l ) B(b ) . 
Then m del\[or tns classe so that reF . resent a-li on sine a ( : h ( : lass shares or tie characteristics . 
Two internal representations , ( l ) , t(a\]) , l ) h , (bj )) an(l(l)A(a;\])~I)B(b2)) , belong to ihesame class if DA ( al ) and DA ( a2 ) are sinlilar in the trite+rion defitmd in the representation language I  ) A .

8 Conclusion
This paper ha+'+described Rhea , the model of language a equisillou , which uses wwy general a C<lui-sition procedure . We assume neither semantic concept . . , + nor syntacli (' rules a priori , lnsiead , we have equipped the model with the general franle work to create the rules thai delimit tilt  , possible conlhinatious of the input . We applied the model to the ( Ic , 1 llaillS of Otlter-wt:q'l ( Is alld linguistic descriplions of then t . The svsle IllSilk'-cessfully made concepts that are consistent with giwm inputs  . "\[' he exper in lenl showed that il reproduced the " setting for lhenew words  , " a human lendency in language acquisition , without language-specific constraints or inforntation aS  ( mrhm vouler worhls are org attized .
