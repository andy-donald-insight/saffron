A methodology is proposed for taking queries and requests expressed in natural language as input and answering them in charts through organizing that interaction into felicitous dialogue  . Charts and graphics , as well as languages , are important modes of communication . This is especially true of those which are used frequently when people analyze huge amount of data interactively  , in order to find out its characteristics or to resolve questions about it  . This paper raises the problem that in such situations the correctness of the charts depends on the context  , and proposes a framework to resolve it . The core of the framework is a logical form that includes the specifications of the user?s perspective and the proper treatment of the logical form for handling utterance fragments  . The framework has been implemented and confirmed to be appropriate  . 
1 Introduction
Charts and graphics , as well as languages , are important modes of communication . Considering this importance , the automatic design of charts and graphics suitable for achieving a given communicative purpose has been studied actively  ( Maybury and Wahlster ,  1998) . It has been demonstrated that the characteristics of data drawn on the chart  ( Mackin-lay ,  1986) , the intention to be achieved through the chart ( Roth and Mattis ,  1990) , and the task accomplished using the chart ( Casner ,  1991 ) play important roles in designing appropriate charts  . The automatic design of multimedia documents in which those charts coordinate with natural language text has also been studied  ( Roth et al , 1991; Kerpedjiev et al ,  1998) . 
In that research , systems take an assertion to be conveyed or a communicative goal to be achieved  , and design the most appropriate multimedia presentation for that purpose  . The purpose of drawing charts and graphics , however , is not restricted just to use in such presentations  . In particular , as the drawing of quantitative charts helps to analyze huge amount of data and to find out its characteristics  , they can be a useful means for interactive exploratory data analysis  . An analyst , led by an interest or question , draws a chart , then a new interest or question comes up and she draws another chart  . 
Through this process , the analyst finds out a characteristic behind the data or understands the reason for it  . 
This paper discusses automatic quantitative chart design that supports such interactive exploratory data analysis  . That is , a methodology is proposed for taking queries and requests expressed in natural language as input and answering them in charts through organizing that interaction into felicitous dialogue  . The objectives of our research are an automatic chart design that considers dialogue context  , and a dialogue mechanism that uses charts as its output mode  . 
2 Context sensibility of chart appropriateness Let ussuppose an analyst  , planning sales of her company?s products , gets interested in its sales in a particular district  . So she requests the following from a system in front of her :  ( 1 ) Show me the sales in the Shikoku district for ?93 and ?94  . 
The system answers this request by drawing an appropriate chart  . She continues and utters a fragment of a request :   ( 2 ) By prefecture .

Correctness (1)
The system understands this fragment and draws a new chart  . This dialogue might be followed by an utterance like:  ( 3 ) Through ?98 . 
The correct chart made in the response to utterance  ( 1 ) is like that shown in Figure 1- ( 1 )  . Following this chart , the response to utterance ( 2 ) should be made by the stacked column chart , as shown in Figure 1-(2) , in which each column is subdivided in order to show the sales by prefecture  . Here , these two consecutive utterances have a combined meaning similar to:  ( 2? ) Show me the sales in each prefecture of the
Shikoku district for ?93 and ?94.
It is interesting that when utterance ( 2? ) is given without a specific context , the response should be made by the grouped column chart  , as shown in Figure 1-(2?) , rather than as in Figure 1-(2) . The preference for Figure 1- ( 2 ) as the response to utterance ( 2 ) may come from the perspective represented in utterance  ( 1 ) that she wants to look at the sales of the district in total or the similarity in shape between Figure  1-  ( 2 ) and 1- ( 1 )  . In any case , it is important that an appropriate chart form depends on what utterance or series of utterances was used to express a request and what chart has been drawn previously  .

Correctness (2) curs constantly . For utterance (3) in the previous dialogue , the chart shown in Figure 1- ( 3 ) is preferred when Figure 1- ( 2 ) is used to answer the previous request . The chart of Figure 1-(3?) is preferred , however , as the response to utterance (3?) , which combines requests (1) , (2) and (3) into one ; (3?) Show me the sales in each prefecture of
Shikoku district from ?93 through ?98.
The chart form is not the only dimension sensitive to dialogue context  . Consider the following example . 
(4 ) Show me the sales in Shikoku and Chugoku for ?93 . 
(5) Add the one for ?94.
(5? ) Showme the sales in Shikoku and Chugoku for ?93 and ?94  . 
The preferred response to utterance ( 5 ) must be in the chart shown in Figure 2- ( 2 ) when preceding utterance ( 4 ) was answered by the chart shown in Figure 2- ( 1 )  , while the chart of Figure 2- ( 2? ) would be used when the request is just utterance ( 5? )  . It is clear that the decision on axis assignment is also context sensitive  . 
In conventional ellipsis handling ( Hendrix et al , 1978; Carbonell and Hayes ,  1983) , the interpretation of an utterance fragment , such as utterance (2) following utterance (1) , is the same as the interpretation of utterance ( 2? )  . When a response based on this interpretation is made  , the data plotted on the chart may be correct , but the chart form and style cannot be . This implies that something extra is needed for handling dialogue in charts  , and it is insufficient just to combine two mechanisms for non-interactive automatic chart design and natural language dialogue understanding  . 
3 Handling dialogue in natural language and charts This section proposes a methodology for handling dialogue in natural language and charts  . First , a logical form that represents the interpretation of utterances is proposed  . Then , how to represent the perspectives from which the user wants to look at the data and how to relate them to chart realization are described  . Last , a way of handling utterance fragments is discussed  . 
3.1 A logical form
A logical form that describes the content of a given utterance must be able to represent what region of data the user is interested in and what type of analysis she wants to conduct in order to obtain the data to be plotted  . Moreover , it must convey the intention of the user , that is , what information she wants to obtain through that chart  . The logical form we propose , which satisfies those requirements , takes the form , I Description , JKJKJKL Action M , where Action specifies the main speech act in a given utterance  , and Descriptions describe constraints or conditions that the objects related to the action should satisfy  . Action can be a request to display charts or a request for information conveyed through charts  . In this paper , however , it only covers requests to display charts , which takes the form NPORQRSUTWVYXUZW[]\_^ List of Vars  , List of Aspects ` , where List of Vars is the list of variables plotted on the chart  . List of Aspects is the list of aspects of the data the user is focusing on and represents the perspectives from which she wants to look at the data  . 
Descriptions describe constraints or conditions that the objects related to the action should satisfy  , which has the form , I Quantifier , Var/Class , Restriction M , where Quantifier is a generalized quantifier , Var is the variable of quantification , and the quantification ranges over the objects each of which is a member of Class and satisfies Restriction  . That is , this logical form is a flattened version of Woods ? MRL  ( Woods ,  1978) , and as in Woods ? MRL , Class can be a function . Moreover , Classes , each of which each variable and object is associated with  , are hierarchically organized and represent not only the domain an object is classified into  , but also its granularity . An object that belongs to the area domain , for example , belongs to one of classes : district , pre-fecture , or city , according to its granularity . The subsumption relation is defined between objects that belong to classes with different granularities and the same domain  . In Restriction , implicit coercion between granularities is allowed and aggregation such as summation is represented implicitly using this mechanism  . 1 For example , utterance ( 2? ) is interpreted into the logical form : a K a K b d c Y b d e K f h g j i l k m f Y b d n d e h g p o ]bqoYrYbdeWstiPgKuwvyxdxKzYkmfYbdndePgqvmxKxylkmfY bKnyeKly ~ Wg a KbdcYb de Kfhgj  lkq ?

The second description states variable ? ranges over objects with prefecture granularity that are subsumed by Shikoku  , which is itself an object with district granularity  . In this case , the equality in the restriction coerces into the subsumption relation  . In the third description , VR [ WZWOPV ?^ m???q ? ?` is a function from time and areato sales amounts  . The perspective is discussed in the next section . 
3.2 Perspectives and chart realization
The second argument of the NPORQRSUTWVYXUZW []\ action specifies the user?s perspective  , which is the list of aspects of the datashe is focusing on  . The following basic aspects are covered for the present  . Suppose Var1 is an element of the first argument of the action  , that is , a variable to be plotted . The ? R ? l ? XP ? W \_^ Var2 ` specifies that the user is interested in comparison of the values of  Var1 by each possible Var2 instance . In other words , she is focusing on the difference in the values of  Var1 which came from the difference of Var2 instances . The ??? [ WZP ? Y ??^ Var2 ` specifies that the user also wants to know the total for the values of  Var1 in all Var2 instances . The X hN?XP ??^ Var2 ` specifies that she is interested in the proportion of each value of  Var1 to the total in all Var2 instances . The ? Y ? [ l?h?PO]?UT ? ?^ Var2 ` specifies that she is interested in the change of value of  Var1 with the change of Var2 instances . The ? R ? l ? XP ? W\_^V ar2 ` is , in a sense , a default since the quantitative chart , in principle , shows variation of the values of a dependent variable by the difference of the values of independent variables  . 
1The way to create a data table to be plotted on a chart from raw material data using this type of logical form was discussed in  ( Matsushita et al ,  2000) . 
From now on , our discussion is restricted to the two -dimensional chart forms for up to two independent variables and one dependent variable  . These forms of charts are widely used and still have plenty of variety  . In chart realization under this restriction , one of the independent variables , which are the arguments of the function in the logical form  , is assigned to the horizontal axis and the other to the hidden or depth axis  . For example , variable ? is assigned to the horizontal axis and variable ? is assigned to the depth axis in the realization of the logical form of the previous example into Figure  1-  ( 2? )  . One of the realization parameters is this axis assignment of variables  . 
Let us think about how the perspective guides chart realization  . In two-dimensional charts , changes of values can be displayed along the horizontal axis using  , say , the line chart , while total and proportion is easy to show on a depth axis by using  , say , the stacked chart . Comparison can be exhibited on either axis . Therefore , ? R?l?XP?W\and?Y ? [ l?h?PO]?UT ? ? are possible for the variable assigned to the horizontal axis  , and ? R?l?XP?W\ , ??? [ WZP?Y ? , and
X hN ?
XP ?? are possible for the variable assigned to the dept haxis  . Next , let us think about what combinations of aspects are possible and sufficient for the perspective  . Since we cannot compare the difference nor see the changes regarding a variable that has only one instance in the range specified by the restriction  , the aspect for such a variable , which we call a uniquely instantiated variable , is meaningless . Excluding that variable , each remaining variable takes only one aspect . Their combination should result in those aspects being properly assigned to the axes  . Here , by subcategorizing ? R ? l?XP ? W\ , which can be assigned to either axis , into ? h?P ? l?XP?W\and??P ? l?XP?W\ , which should be assigned to the horizontal and depth axis respectively  , you can assign an axis to the variables only by assigning one aspect to each  . Thus , when two independent variables , ? and ? , are not uniquely instantiated , one of them , say ? , takes either ? h?P ? l?XP?W\_^m?U`or?Y ? [ l ? h?PO]?UT ? ?^ m ? ?`  , and the other , say ? , takes either ? ? P ? l ? XP ? W\_^m ? ?` , ??? [ WZP?Y ? ?^ m ? ?` , or X hN?XP ? ?^ m ? ?` . In this case , variable ? is assigned to the horizontal axis and variable ? to the depth axis  . Both variables are not allowed to take aspects assigned to the same axis  . The combination of ? ? P ? l ? XP ? W\_^m ? ?` and ?? ? [ WZP ? Y ? ?^ m ? ?` is forbidden  , for example . Figure 3 summarizes the relationship between combinations of aspects and realized chart forms  . 
Now , chart realization is reduced to aspect assignment  . In other words , you can realize an appropriate chart from a given user utterance by obtaining its logical form  , and , if some of the aspects are implicit in the utterance  , by completing the perspective using the characteristics of the data concerned  , the current context and so on . 2 Obtaining and completing the perspective , which is vital for chart realization , is carried out as follows . 3 ? A portion of the perspective is explicit in the utterance  . For example , it is obvious that the user is focusing on the change over time when she says that she wants to see the change in sales  . Such perspectives are acquired through the interpretation of her utterance  . 
? Characteristics of statistics returning a dependent variable sometimes suggest the perspective  . For example , share and profitability suggest her interest in the proportion to the total  . 
Such characteristics are used for completing the perspective  . 
? The class of independent variables also suggests the perspective  . A class whose instances constitute an interval scale  , such as a time series , suggests changes over it ( i . e . ? Y?[l?h?PO]?UT ? ? ) for its aspect to be focused on when the variable ranges over a lot of instances  . Even when it has a few instances , comparisons by it ( i . e . ? h?P ? l?XP?W \) are preferred . This criterion for selecting between ? Y ? [ l ? h ? PO]?UT ?? and ? h?P ? l?XP?W\is used throughout this paper  . 
? When variables with more than one instance are left with no aspect  , a default is used . 
When just one such variables is left , it takes ? Y ? [ l?h?PO]?UT ? ? or ? h?P ? l?XP?W \ if possible  , otherwise it takes ? ? P ? l?XP ? W\ . When two such vari-2Chart realization has dimensions other than those discussed here  . For example , while the independent variable is always assigned to the vertical axis in our discussion  , it can be assigned to the horizontal axis . The rank of instances on an axis , the scales of axes , and visual prompts such as labels and arrows are also dimensions which should be considered  ( Mittal , 1998; Fasciano and Lapalme ,  1996) . Although discussion of those dimesions exceeds the scope of this paper  , we believe that a natural extension of perspective would cover them  . 
3 In implementation , perspective completion based on these features is more sophisticated  , referring to heuristics from a textbook for drawing charts  ( Zelazny ,  1996 ) and knowledge acquired from a chart corpus using a machine learning technique  ( Yonezawa et al ,  2000) .

3 . 3 Utterance fragments and chart appropriateness Utterance fragments in a specific context should be interpreted not as a logical form  , but as a request to revise the logical form given as the context  . In order to correctly handle chart appropriateness  , which is sensitive to the context , the perspective in the logical form should be revised appropriately according to that request  . First , utterance fragments are classified into the following categories according to what part of the logical form should be revised as a result of those fragments  . Examples are shown , which are assumed to have been uttered after the utterance  , ? Showme the sales in Shikoku and Chugoku from ?93 through ?95  . ? Domain alteration : The Restriction part of an independent variable is revised  . Examples , ? Just
Shikoku . ?, ? Through ?98.?
Granularity alteration : The Class part of an independent variable is revised to one with a different granularity  . Examples , ? By quarter . ?, ? By prefecture . ? Statistic alteration : The function returning the dependent variable  , which locates its Class part , is revised . Examples , ? Show me the number of the dealers . ? Perspective alteration : The perspective is revised  . 
Examples , ? Show me the change . ? , ? How about the total ? ? The type of content words  , clue words , and specific phrases contained are exploited for interpreting utterance fragments and for classifying them into one of the above categories  . Using those , we can identify what part of the logical form should be changed and how  . In addition to the revisions identified , appropriate revision of the perspective is needed for correct chart realization  . Revisions of perspective are summarized as follows  . 4 ? As a result of domain alteration on variable X  , if the number of instances of X turns into more than one and the current perspective includes no aspect relating to X  , that is , X is a uniquely instantiated variable , check?Y ? [ l?h?PO]?UT ? ?^ X` , ? h?P ? l?XP?W\_^X ` , and ? ? P ? l?XP ? W\_^X ` in this order , and add the first possible one to the perspective  . On the other hand , if X turns into a uniquely instantiated variable , delete the aspect related to X from the perspective  . 
? As a result of granularity alteration on variable X  , if the number of instances of X turns into more than one and the current perspective includes no aspect related to X  , check?Y ? [ l?h?PO]?UT ? ?^ X` , ? h?P ? l?XP?W\_^X ` , ??? [ WZP?Y ? ?^ X` , and ? ? P ? l?XP ? W\_^X ` in this order , and add the first possible one to the perspective  . Here , ? ? ? [ WZP ? Y ? ?^ X ` is possible only when the statistics concerned use summation for aggregation  . On the other hand , if X turns into 4Revisions of perspective for statistic alterations and perspective alterations are omitted  , because the space is limited and our concern is to trace the changes of the user?s perspective especially when she does not mention them explicitly  . 
a uniquely instantiated variable , delete the aspect related to X from the perspective  . 
4 Examples
This section demonstrates how our proposal addresses the problems raised  . First , let us consider series of utterance (1) , (2) and (3) . The interpretation of utterance ( 1 ) is a Ka KbdcYb de Kfhg jilkmf Ybdn de hgpo ]bqoYrYbdeWstiPgKuwvyxdxKzYkmfYbdndePgqvmxKxylkmfY bKnyeKly ~ Wg a KbdcYb de Kfhgj  lkm?l?d?a ? m?hgjY ?

Y ? [ l?h?PO]?UT ? ?^ m ? ?` , but ? h?P ? l?XP ? W\_^m ? ?` . 
Variable ? , which ranges over areas , is uniquely instantiated and no aspect is given to it  . The chart realized from this logical form is the column chart of Figure  1-  ( 1 )  . The chart form is determined from the perspective by referring to Figure  3  . When utterance (2) is given in this context , it is interpreted as a granularity alteration on variable ?  , and ?

NhT ? ? P ? . In addition , ? ? ? [ WZP ? Y ? ?^ m ? ?` is added to the perspective  , since no aspect related to ? was in it and sales is a statistic for which summation is used for aggregation  . The perspective ends up with ? ? h?P ? l?XP ? W\_^m ? ?`? ???? [ WZP ? Y ? ?^ m ? ?` Y ?  , and the new chart is the stacked column chart of Figure  1-  ( 2 )  . Utterance ( 3 ) in this context is interpreted as a domain alteration on variable ?  . Since the perspective remains the same as before , while the restriction of variable ? is revised according to the utterance  , the chart obtained is of the same form , which is shown in Figure 1-(3) . 
On the other hand , for utterance (2?) , as neither its expression nor its statistic implies a specific aspect  , the perspective is determined according to the characteristics of the independent variables  . 
First , variable ? representing time series obtains ? h?P ? l?XP ? W\_^m ? ?`  , and then variable ? ranging over areas is given ? ? P?l?XP ? W\_^m??`  . The perspective ends up with ? ? h?P ? l?XP ? W\_^m ? ?`????? P?l?XP?W\_^m??`l ?  , and the chart realized is the grouped column chart shown in Figure  1-  ( 2? )  . For utterance (3?) , almost the same criteria are applied , but the aspect given to variable ? is ? Y ? [ l ? h ? PO]?UT ? ?^ m?U ` as it has many instances  . As a result , the grouped line chart of Figure 1- ( 3? ) is realized . 
Let us move to series of utterance (4) and (5).
For utterance (4) , since variable ? representing time series is uniquely instantiated  , no aspect is given . 
Then variable ? ranging over districts can obtain ? h?P ? l?XP ? W\_^m ? ?`  . By utterance (5) following it , domain alteration on ? is specified , and ? obtains the possible aspect ? ? P ? l?XP?W \_^m ? ?`  , since ? h?P ? l?XP?W\_^m?U`already exists . On the other hand , for utterance (5?) , variable ? representing time series priors variable ?  , obtaining ? h?P ? l?XP ? W\_^m ? ?` . As a result , Figure 2-(2) , the response to utterance (5) , and Figure 2-(2?) , the response to utterance (5?) , are different in their axis assignments . 
5 Discussion
Appropriateness of charts is known to be a function of several factors  . This paper revealed that discourse context is one of those factors in addition to those already known such as characteristic of data and user intentions  , and proposed a methodology for addressing that factor properly  . To our knowledge , there are few studies on automatic chart design for such interactive situations as discussed here  . There are many studies on interactive graph drawing of course  ( Roth et al ,  1994) . Those , however , are concerned with tools for producing a graph interactively that achieves the user?s intention  . Their standpoint differs from ours , and the mode used for their interactions is direct manipulation not natural language  . 
Our proposal partially overlaps with recent studies on automatic chart design  . Our logical form has a lot in common with the content language in  ( Green et al ,  1998) . The objective of their research , however , is to describe communicative goals to be achieved through generating graphics and text  , and differs from ours , which is to describe the user?s requests in order to respond to them using charts  . 
Our perspective plays a similar role to that of intention in PostGraphe  ( Fasciano and Lapalme ,  1996) . 
However , there is a crucial difference in that , while their intention is given as input , our perspective is acquired from the user?s utterances  , data characteristics and dialogue context . 
Most of the framework proposed in this paper has been implemented  . The prototype system accepts such a wide range of Japanese expressions that the appropriateness of our proposal can be confirmed  , though the understanding of those expressions is driven by a simple pattern-based mechanism  . The matter worth special mention is the pro -to type?s chart redraw mechanism  . As suggested in this paper , a correct chart in a certain context is one that can be realized by minimum change to the chart as the context  , and loses minimum information from it . We supposed that changes and loss of information mattered because considerable mentalloads are needed to relate new information in the new chart to old information in the context  . In order to reduce those loads , we made the process of change visually understandable  . Specifically , the system shows animations that represent which component of the current chart moves and changes to which component of the new one  . This feature has received a favorable reception in demonstrations  . 
A lot remains for future work . First , we will consider answering wh-and yes no interrogatives in charts in addition to answering requests to show charts  . Answering such questions fluently requires collaboration between charts and text  . Then , we will examine richer chart realization . We should consider not only increasing the kinds of chart form covered  , but also assembling more than one chart to achieve a certain goal  . In addition , dimensions such as visual prompts should be incorporated  . Lastly , in the context of information visualization , the effects of animation introduced in the implementation of the prototype should be measured quantitatively to prove that it really can reducement alload rather than merely make itself conspicuous  .
