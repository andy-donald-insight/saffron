A PHRASESTRUCTUREG RAMMAR OF THE ARABICL ANGUAGE
AYMANEL NAG GARi

A lot of work has been done
in the field of natural language
processing ( NLP ) for ARABIC . Few
researchers have tried hard to apply
on ARABIC the methods of
computational linguistics , as for
example , Definite Clause Grammar
(DCG)\[I\] and Augmented Transition
Networks ( ATN )\[2\]. Because there is
not a modern linguistic model for
ARABIC grammar within the frame of
computational linguistics , the
results achieved are not comparable
with that achieved on ENGLISH.
In this paper , we represent the
phrase structures covering ARABIC.
They are completely different from

i . INTRODUCTION
Since ARABIC is a rich and
highly inflected language\[3\], there
are grannnatical categories in
ARABIC which do not exist in other
foreign languages such as in ENGLISH
\[4\]. For example , there is an ARABIC
category 2 called ' I/A FOOL MOTLAK'
which has no equivalent in ENGLISH.
Moreover , there are syntactic
categories in ARABIC which could
themselves beaw hole sentence or
even a psepositional phrase An
example of such a category is the
adverb . In addition , there are other
differences in the order of the
constituents within the sentence . For
example , in ARABIC , adjectives follow
the noun which they modify.
In fact , ARABIC has its own
structure , which is completely

different from ENGLISH and hence,
requires a different treatment.
2. ARABICAND COMPUTATIONAL

As the need increases to a
model of A ~% BIC , ARABIC linguists try
to reorganize the granmlatic system
in a way that may help the
researchers in the field of
computational linguistics . Linguists
is traditionally concerned with
formal , general , structural models of
natural language . Linguists,
therefore , have tended to build
formal models which allow to capture,
as much as possible , the
regularities of language and make the
most appropriate linguistic
generalizations . Little or no
attention has been paid to
characterize the language itself,
ignoring the mechanism that produce
it or decipher it.
So , the researchers spent most
of the time in rebuilding the models
given by the linguists . Their aim was
to make these models acceptable in
computational field(synthesis,
generation and translation).
2. iTHEKEY
What is new in this work is
that we classified all the noun
phrase modifiers into two categories.
Category one , noun phrase post-
modifiers , in which the ordered
sequence of these modifiers is
significant and it is the key to
construct these noun phrase
structures These modifiers are noun
complement ( NC ), adjective ( ADJ),
apposition ( APP ) and correlation
(COR ). Category two which consists
mainly from VP modifiers like adverb.
The above categorization has
given us the ability to focus on each
category and finally the NP
structures were obtained.

3. THENOUNPHRASESTRUCTURES
We have Eight structures
covering all the categories of noun
phrases . FIVE of these structures are
giw ~ n here.
The notation used in
describing these structures is : -
() = The category inside these
brackets is optional.
*() = The category inside these
brackets could be repeated more than
once.
\[\] = The category inside these
brackets exists once at least ?
*\[\] = The category inside these
brackets could be repeated but it
should exists once at least ?
Representation is in
Chomsky's Normal Form and should be
interpreted from right to left
The structures given here
consist mainly of NOUN ( N ) as the
basic unit and its maximum allowable
post-modifier 8 which could follow it
These post-modifiers have a
specific sequence which is the key to
construct these structures and
according to the number of these
postmodifiers , the structures vary
The NP structures as well as some of
the ARABIC categories they
constitute , are given in Fig . (1)
Example of a simple Arabic
verbal sentence is given in Fig . (2)
In this example , the object of the
sentence has all the post-modifiers
given in the structure NPI and It is
clear that some of these modifiers
have their own embedded structures
shown in the embedded rectangles
4. MODIFICATION
' MAFOOL MOTLAK ' is a special
modifier in Arabic which has a
different forms depending on its
postmodifiers . We have first\[5\]
considered its structure as:
*( ADJ)(NC ) NOUN
But later on , we have found out that
both NC and ADJ cannot exist
simultaneously and only one of them
should exist alone . So , we have split
this structure to three structures

and support Also ~, I would like to

comments reviewing the paper and who,
first , implemented most of the
structures given here ?
CONCLUSION
We have tried here to present
the paper in a framework showing
that the study of computational
modeling of ARABIC faces many
problems . It is evident that : , the
ARABIC possesses a certain symmetry
as regards its structure , which leads
itself easily to computation . This
work is the basis of any further
computational processing of ARABIC,
leading to semantic analysis and
eventually machine translation o
