A high-level language lor the description of inflectional morphology is presented  , in which the organization of word lormation rules into an ii ~ herilance hierarchy of paradigms allows lor a natural encoding of the kinds of n flestypically pre~uted in grammar txroks  . We show how tim language , composed of orthographic rides , word formation rules , and paradigm inheritance , can be compiled into a runtime data structure for efficient morphological analysis and generation with a dynamic secondary storage lexicon  . 
1 Introduction
Pedagogical grmnmar Nalks typically organize their de-scriptinns of the inflectiomd morphology of a langtmge in terms of paradigms  , groups of rnlas which characterize the inflectional behavior of some subset of the language's vocabulary  . A French grannnar may divide verbs into the first  , secoud , and third conjugations ; German grammars speak of " weak " and " strong " verbs  ; Spanish grammars classify verbs by their infiuitival endings  , etc . The family nf wordforms that each v ( x : abuhu ' y item may have can thus he describe xl by a combination of a ba~stem  ( such as the " citation lbrm " used to index words in a dictionary  ) and the paradigm the word belongs to . Irregular words , which exhibit belu ~ viors not completely captured by general paradigms  , often tend to be partially describable by reference to regular parudigmatic patterns  . 
The word formation rules that comprise a paradigm are usually expressed in terms of a sequence of stem change and affixation operations  . For example , one French text-Imok\[NEBEL 741 , in describing first conjugation verbs , shows how to fi ) rmpresent tense forms nsing the inliniti-valstem with its " er " suffix rm noved  . Future tense is tormed by appending ' , ff fixes to the fifll infinitival stem , while the stem of the imperfect tense is Ionnd by taking the first person plural of the present ense and dropping the " on s "  . Ill addition to such word formation roles , there are spelling change rules w bich describe variations ill spelling  , often ctm ditioned by file phonologic ~ dor orthographic on text h which a word l brnlation rule is applied  . 
While the above characterization fmor phological behavior is a huniliaroue  , in ost description languages that have been developed for cumputatioual morphology  ( e . g . , IKC)-SKENNIEMI841 , \[G ( RZ881 ) have tended to locus more on the orthographic and of fixation rules  , and payless attention to explicitly captaring the regularities within and between paru dignts  . Recently , some researchers have begun exploring the advantages to be derived from an or a  . 
tion in which paradigms play a more central role ( e . g . ,\[ CALDER 891 . IRUSSELL 911) . This paper present such a notation , called PDL ( for Paradigm Description l . au-guage ) , which we are using as the basis of the morphological an ~ dyzer for  A1-STARS   , a multilingual " lexicon-assisted " informatiml retrieval system  ( \[ANICK901 )  . It has been a goal of our high-level language design to pre-~rve  , a sumch as possible , the kinds of descriptive devices traditiorually used in grammar books  . 
Our approach to the representation fpm acfigms borrows from the Artificial Intelligence cmn munity's notion of " frames "  , data structures made up ( ff slots with attached proced ares , orgmlized hierarchically to snpport default slot inheritance and overtkles  ( e . g . ,\[BOBROW 771) . In a paradigm ' s " frume " , the slots correspond to surlace antistem li)nns , whose values are either explicitly stoxvd ( in the lexicon ) or else computed by word formation rules . 
The hierarchical organization of paradigms helps to cap-tore the sharexl linguistic behaviors among classes of words in all explicit and concise mlnnler  . 
Our ; qlplicatiou domain introdnces several constraints on the design of its morphological component : - The morphological recognizer must work with a dynamic secondary storage lexicn n access ~ xl via an index on stem to r n l s  .

Our aim is to develop morphological rcpmsenlations t branumber of  ( primarily European ) hm guages . We have built t ~ firly complete representations h ) r English , French , and Gennan , and have begun inv cs figating Spanish . 
While it is premature to predict how well our approach will apply across the range of European langnages  , we have fimndit contains an nmher of desirable aspects for applications such as AI-STARS  . 
in the next section , we provide an overview of the PDL hm guage , describing how word fonnation rules are organized into a hierarchy of paradigms and how the lexicon and morphological rules interact  . Then we provide an illustration of the use of paradigm inheritance to construct a concise encoding of French verb forms  . Next we present algorithms for the compilation of PDL rote efficient runtime data structures  , and lot the recognition and generation of word fi ) rm s . We conclude with an evaluation of the strengths antiweaknesses of rite approach  , and areas for future research . 
2 Paradigm Description Language
Oar paradigm description language ( PDL ) is composcd of three major components-form rules  , an inheritance hierarchy of paradigms , and orthographic rules . 
2.1 Form Rules
We divide word lorms into ? surface forms , which are those that show tip in a text , ? lexical forms , which are those that are stored directly in the lexicon  , and ? intermediate forms , those forms created by affixation or stem-change operations applied to other lorms  . These terms may notever show up in a text but are useful in describing intermediate steps in the construction of surlh celorms from lexical f i  ) rms . 
In the formenns truction rules , we distinguish between two major categories of strings  . Stems are any forms which include the primary \[ exical base of tile word  , whereas affixes comprise tile prefixes and suffixes which can be concatenated with astein in the process of word formation  . Once an affix is appended to or removed from a stem  , the result is also a stem , since tire result also includes the primary lexical base  . Form construction rides , are restrict exl to the five cases below : ? < form > : < stem > +< affix >? < form > : < stem > -< affix >? < form > :+< affix > < stem > ? < form >:-< affix > < stem > ?< for ul >: < stein > The < lot to > is a name for the string form created by the rule  . < stem > is the name of astein form . < affix > may be a prefix or suffix string ( or string variable )  , its type ( i . c . , prefix or suffix ) impliex l by its position before or after the < stcm > in the rulc  . The operator (+ or -) always precexles the affix . If + , then the affix is appended to the stem as a prefix or suffix  . If -, then the affix is remove x l from the stem . The rest , lting < lorm > name may in turn be used as a stem in the consU'uctionel some other krm  . In this way , the construction of a surface form may be described via a succession of affix at in nor stem -change operations  , each operation described in a single rule . 
The special syndml LEX may be used in the right -hand-side of a form rule to imlicate that the to nn is stored as a lexical stem in the lexicon  . 
Grammatical \[ ~ ttures may be associated with form names  , as follows : < form >\[ < feature >= < vahte > , <feature >= < value > ,   . . . \] 2 . 2 Paradigms A paradigm in PDL is composed of a set of term construction rules which collectively characterize the filmily of surface forms for those words which belong tn that paradigm  . To capture the similarities among paradigms and to avoid redundancy in the description of a language  , we allow one paradigm to be based on another paradigm  . 
If paradigm B is based on paradigm A , then all the fimns and fi ) rm construction rules that have been defined R ) r paradigm A also apply , by default , to paradigm B . We can then differentiate paradigmB ti'omA in three ways : I  . We can add new lorms and their conslrnction rules fi ~ rtbrms that do not exist in A  . 
ACN-~SDE COLING-92 , NAi VFES , 2328 AO6"r199268 PREC . O1 . ' COLING-92, NANTES , AUG .  2328, 1992 2 . We cue rewrite ( override ) tile construction rnlestor to rnlsIhaldo exist in A  . 
3 , if ali ) rrain A is no longer applicable in \[ I , we can delete it lionlt3 . 
Note that the l ~ t tn reset ( s ) associated with lornl names cannot change froin paradign l to l  ) aradignl ; for nl nanles are nniversal , denoting tim same l catures regardless of where they appear  . 
Ill order to facilitate the capture of generalizations across paradigms  , we allow tile definition of abstract pam dignls . 
These ; i reparadigms to which no words of a langnagoac -tnally belong  , hut which contain a sotoft brnls and con -smictions which other paradigms have in connnon  . Thus a COll CrCic paradign lnlay be based on shine  ( ) tiler concrete paradigm or on an abstract l ) aradigm . Likewise , air abstract paradigm nlay itself be based on yet another abstract  ( or concrete ) paradigm . 
The ability to base one paradign lonan other , combined with the ability to represent intermediates tenlforms  ; IS slols in a paradigm , is a very lXl werful feature of our morphological description langnage  . Not only does it allow for paradign/descriptions that correspond closely with the kinds of descriptions lonnding raminar hooks  , but , since the roguhirilies alnong paradignls can Ix : a hstracled on t and shared hynniliil/te llara diglns  , it alklws for very concise descrill tionsel ioil octional he havin r  ( in chlding subregularities often overlooked in grauln larhooks  )  ,  ; . is il-
Inslrated in section 3.
2 . 3 Orthographic Rules l , ' orm COll Slfnction rules describe which stems can coln-bine with which aflixes to create new or ms  . The concatenation or removal of all affix may in some cases result ill fl spoiling change other than tile me reconcatenation or removal of tile affix string  . In English , in any words ending in a vowel followed by a consonant will donble the final consonant whmlan affix starting with a vowel is appended  , ill French , the addition of certain affixes requires that ; in " e " in the stein of some verbs be rewritten as " ~  , " . 
Since these spelling change rules ; ire often hased on general phonological /orthographicll roperties nfalfixes and steins  , rather lhnnllle specific for ln rules I he , ln solvos , and hmlce may apply a crnss paradigms , we supllort them ? le-poudents t ? ~ cificatinn of spelling rules caplnring lheso changes  . Each rnle is written to all ply to the orthographic context of as len/and affix attile point el the concatenation or deletion opontiion  . Thus , there ; ire two kinds of spelling rules : 1 , Suffix rules , which describe spelling changes applying to the end of tile stem and the hoginnmg of the snffix  , and 2 . Prefix rnles , which describe spelliug changes al I-II lying to tile endellhcprelix and t imbeginning of the stein  , A sllelling rule can make reference to literal strings and variables  . A vnriahle refers to an anled Set of characters and/or slrings  , snch as Vowelf , a , e , i , o ai ) or Dental(d , t , dn , m , chn , fn , gn ) . The grammar writernray defines nch sets and variables ranging over those gets  . 
The general feral of a suffix spelling rule is ; is fklllows: ( < parameter >* ) \[< slcm-pane Hl > l < opcrator > < a flixpaneul > I > \[< merg tulpaner n >\] < lots > The opelator may he either ~ or  , indicnting concatenation and deletion respectively  . The < in crged-pattern > reliars to tile term constructed by perfornlmg tile operation on a Stem and alfix  . The two pattelnst in tile left of tile arrow refer lotiles lemantiaffix parlicipating ill tile construction  . Each pattern is a list of variables and/or literal strings  . Whenevertile stlnle variable nanle appears more I \] lanonce ill the rule  , it is assnlned to take on tiles a lile value throughout  . 
< paranletcr > is alloole : in condition on the applical lility of tile spelling ride  , It it necessary fort tloso cases wile retile application of the rnle depends on iuik  ) rlnntional ) on t the lexical ilcln whk'h is not in clnded in I h ? orlhograllhy  . 
( Like BEAR 88I , we choose to represe ot these conditions ; is featn res rather tllan ; is diacritics IKOSK ENNIEMIB 4I , ) All exanlllle in linglish where a parameter is necessary is lhecase of gonlinating final consonants  . Gelnina Linntle-pends onll honological ciiaracteristics which  ; ire not pro-dictahle fronltile spelling alone . Only words whose lexi-cnlentries contain the specified parameter valne will nndergo spelling change sensitive to that parameter  . 
Specifying orthographic rules in del~ndently el the specific affixe  , s to which they apply allows for a more coucise declarative rcpresenlu \ [ ioll  , as regnklritics across pal'a-digms and Ibrms can I ~  , , abstracted out . However , there are cases in which the application of ; in orthographic rnleis constrained to specific paradigms or to specific forms wilh in a paradigin  .

tlore we ill nslrato a hypothelical spelling rule : I"a " ConsConsli/Vowell > "  t2"   ( ? tills Vowel Ac+r Es DI ! COLING 92 , NAN qES . 2328 AO~r199269 F"XoC . OFC()1, IN(3-92, NANTES . AUG .  2328 , 1992 This is a suffix rule , since the operator precedes the second left-hand -side pattern  . Accordingly , the < stem-pattern > refers to the characters at the end of the stem while the < affix-pattern > refers to the letters at the beginning of the affix  . This rule states that , if we are appending an affix which begins with a vowel to a stem which ends in the character " a " followed by two identical consonants  , then we construc the resulting form ( < merged-pattern > ) as follows : 1 . Remove the last three characters from the stem , leaving < sub-stem > . 
2 . Remove the first character fom the suffix , leaving < sub-all ix > . 
3 . Construct the string < spell-change > by concatenating the strings and i astantiated character variables described by the right-hand -side pattern  . 
4 . Construct he resulting form as the concatenation of the string s < sub-stem >  , < spell-change > , and < sub-affix > . 
2.4 The Lexicon
We have seen above how one paradigm can be based on another  , thereby allowing lorm conslruction roles to be " inherited " by paradigms  . This inherit ~ mce is controlled through the form names themselves  . If we have a paradigm B based on paradigm A , then any form rules in A for which there is no rule in B with the same form name are by detroit assumed to be part of paradigm B  . 
Although on r lexicon is maintained as a secondary storage database with entries represented and indexed differently from the  ( memory resident ) paradigms , it is useful to think of a lexical entry as " inheriting " rules from its paradigm ~ ts well  . The inflectional behavior of any individnal word will depend on both the information inherited from its paradigm and the information stored in the lexicon  . 
Lexicon entries contain the equivalent of a single kind of form construction rule : < fi  ) rm > : < stem >/ superse de I augment The interaction of lexical information with the word ' sp ~ tradigm is as fi  ) llows : ? If < form > correspends to a lexical stem nile in the paradigm  ( i . e . , one whose right-hand-side is the special symbol LEX  )  , then this form provides the stem fi ) r that rule . 
? If < form > correspomLs to a surface form in the paradigm or an iutermediate form qualified with the qualifier/allow lexical override  , then the lcxical for nleither superse des or augments the consU'nc-tion rule in the paradigm  , depending on the value of the stem's/\[ superse de I augment qualifier  . 
The qualifier/allow_lexical override is necessary to inform the runtime inflectional analyzer when to attempt a lexical lookup of an intermediate form stem  . By default , the analyzer looks up any form found directly in the text  ( surface form ) and any forms whose righthand side is LEX . The use of the/allow lexical override flag can save disk accesses by limiting lexical lookups of intermediate forms to just those cases in which lexical overrides may actually occur  . 
Utilizing the/allow lexical_overrid equalifier and the default lookup of suri ~  , ceforms , one could write lexical entries in which all the rules in a paradigm were overridden by lexical information  . In general , this is not a good idea , since it fails to take advantage of the generalizations that paradigms provide  , but there are exceptional cases , such as the verb " be " , fl ~ r which there must necessarily be a large number of lexical stems  . Allowing lexical overrides in this manner eliminates the need to create tmexcessive number of highly idiosyncratic paradigms specifically to accomodate irregular verbs in languages like French and 
German ( see section 3).
3 Using Paradigm Inheritance to Capture
Linguistic Generalizations
In PDL , word formation is characterized as a sequence of discrete transformational steps  , lumany cases , paradigms ( as well as iudividua lexical items ) will differ with respecto one or more of these intermediate steps  , yet share the bulk of the rules that apply to the results of the intermediate operations  . Default inheritance , including the inheritance of the partially derived forms  , makes it possible to expres such facts very succinctly  . Figure I depicts the hierarchy of paradigms we have developed for the French verbs  . The root of the hierarchy ( VERBROOT ) represents the " greatest common denominator " of all the paradigms in the hierarchy  .   ( All of the inteianediate form rules in the root paradigm are shown in Figure  1  , but many of the surface form rules are omitted because of space limitations  . However , all of the form rules , both intermediate and surface , in the other paradigms are listed . ) The first sub-paradigm , VERBER , represents wlmt are commonly referred to , as first conjugation verbs , VERB_IR represents the second conjugation , and VERB_RE_IR , VERBOIR , and VERBRE together represent he third conjugation  , which includes virtually all of the " irregular " verbs  . 
\ [BESCHERELLE90\] describes over 70 conjugation types that fall within one of the three basic groups  , the third group being subdivided iuto three sections  , one for their regular verbs ending in-ir , one tier the-oir verbs and one for the-re verbs  . These sections map directly onto para-A ?_' TESDI , : COLING-92 , NAI ' CrHS , 2328 Aotrr 199270 PROC . OFCOLING-92, NANTES , AUG . 2328, 1992 digms VERB . REIR , VERBOIR , and VERBRE , respectively , with the exception of several types ( which actually fit VERBROOT directly . ) Through the use of form rule inheritance , intermediate for modes , lexical override and orthographic rules , we arcable to condense the rules for the 78 types into these six paradigms , which capture in a straightforward way most of the linguistic regularities within and among the paradigms  . 
The useful role played by intermediate form rides in inheritance can be seen by comparing the VERB ER and VERBIR paradigms  . Both share ( inherit ) the impinter mediate form and the set of six surface forms that do-scribe the imperfect tense  ( e . g . , impIs ) . However , they differ in the siir facel brmprt ~ s_lp , which is overridden in VERBIR , and in the interlnediate form bllse , which is overridden in VERB_ER . The interesting point here is that even though the imperfect indicative tetr as employ the stein imp  , a form that is generated from a form that is not shared  ( prOslp ) and wliich is in turn generated from an unshared form  ( base )  , both the impstem ~ md the set of imperfect indicative forms may still be shared  . 
Another example of how ovcrridable intermediate fonnniles can be used to condense paradiguls is provided by the VERB_REIR paradign t  ( which handles all of their regular verbs ending in-it that behaven lore like the-reverbs  , e . g . , dormir and v~tir ) and its sub-paradigms . This is accomplished by first defining a new intermediate form  , prl~s_s , which may be ove I liden by a lexical entry ( or stem change rule )  . This , , dlows for au irregular stem in the singular fonns of the present indicative  ( e . g . , dormir->dot . mouvoir -> meu ) whilclint overriding the baseform , which is used elsewhere . Secoudly , allowing lexical override of the stems used to generate the fliture and t  ) res , ent conditional tense forms ( fur ) and the past simple and imped cctsubjunctiv c terms  ( pas )  , respectively , allows for irregular stems such as valoir --> vaudr  ( fur ) antimouvoir --> mu ( pas )  . 
We have found this combination of intermediate form niles and lexical override us cful for defining paradign is for Gemlan verbs as well  . Bccaus csome strong verbs un . .

4 Compilation and Runtime Algorithms
APDL description is conpiled into a non -ileterministic transition network  , suilable tor the recognition and generation of wordforms  , as tollows . First , the form rules arc chained into a network based on the formian tcs appearing in the rules ' left audright hand sides  . The full set el paradigms u ) which each formlule applies is calculated and stored  ;  . it each corresponding node in the network . 
Then the orthographic rules are conftated with lhe word formatirn l rules by unifying tile orthographic patterns with tile affixes th the form rules  , Finally , a character discrimination et is constructed front all suffix surface lorm rules to optimize tile rul-linlcinate hing of the outermost suffix patterns in the form rule transition et  . 
During morphological nalys is , tile conflated patterns arc matched agains the input string and the string undergoes whatever I ranslormation tile correspontling word lkrma -tion rule diclates  . At each step through the network , the set of paradigms for which that step is valid is intersected with the set that has been valid tip to that point in the derivation  . If this intersection becomes NULL , then the path is a banthmed asiu valid . Traversal through the net pro-ceetl sahmg; . ill possible paths for as h ) ng its patterns continue to match . Lexicou Iookups of candidate stem strings occur only when a I  , EX node or node marked ; is Icxically overritk thle is reached . If a lexical stein matching the fern mune , paradigm set , and t catur constrnints acquired from theue t is found  , then its lenlna is returned . 
For generation , the traversal is reversed , l lowever , mor-tier to calcuhtte the sequence uf rules to traver setu generate a surface lorm  , we must work backwards from the nile that prty . luces the desired surtitce form ( given the paradigm of tile lemma ) to the rule that precedes that rule , and s(Ion , untd were a chalorm whose stem is salted with the lemma in the lexicon  . At this point , we know both the proper starting lexical stem li ) rm and tile sequence n f rules to apply to that stem  . 
5 Discussion
A number of researchers have proposed tile use of tither\[-lance in representing aspects of natural language  ( e . g . , \[ IIUDSON841 , \[ EVANS 891 ID AELE MANS 9I ) I , \[ PUSTEJOVSKY 91\]) . The wnrk described here is most similar in spirit to the wurk of \[  CALDER89 and \[ R/JS-SELL91\]  , who also al ) ply principles of del ; casible in heri-lance to 111e domain of conllltltational morphology , Cal-dot's word Rmnation rules make use of string equations  , an elegant and powerful tlechtrative device which  , while more expressive than our ( deliberately ) conslraine tlwm'dlbn natio and orthographic rules  , mayb cless amenable to efficient compilation antiappears geared towards anth-memory lexicon  . By di~llowing recursion in our form rules , limiting each form rule to at most one affix at km operation  , and encoding directionality within our nrthtl -graphic patterns  , wc are able to cOral ) lie rules into transition networks in a swaightforward manner  , reducing the need for extensive runtime unification  . In oar experience to date , these language limitations have m ) t interfered wilt the concise capture of morphological behavior  . Indeed , our separation of orthographic rules and fonn talcs allows us to capture orthographic gmt cralizatim tshat Calder  ( 1989 ) can m ) t . Furthermore , whereas Calder's system " disallows the possibility of inheritance of partial derived string forms  , " we have found that the th herita nee of intermedia test mns contributes considerably to the descriptive power of our hrmalism  . 
Russell ctal ( \[ RUSSELL 911 ) have t level np ctl language extensions to the PATR II style aniii catiou grammar Ibr-realism which allow lot multiple de fanlt inheritance in the description of lexical entries  . Multil ) leinheritance is a useful tool fur partitioning syntactic  , semantic , and morphological classeselbe havior . However , while we have encountered occasional cases i u which a word appears to derive variants Item multil  ) le paradigms , we have s of , ' ~ rnpted to preserve the simplicity ol a single it th critance hierarchy in PDL  , utilizing extra lexical stems to accomodate such variants when they arise  . 
Byrd and Tzoukermann ( \[BYRD8 81 ) no lo that I heir French word grammar contains 165 verb stem rules and another 110 affix rules ; and they question the rehltive valuenf storing rules versus inflected Iorms  . This is a concern of ours as well , as we wish to minimize the number of runtime "\[ ~ dsealan'as "  , lXltential stems generated during morplological nalys is which do not actually exist in the lexicon  . Our mlxtel of the French verb inflections uses 81 form rules and 17 orthogmlhic rules . We have tried totle sign our paradigms to minimize the numt x zr of inflected stems that must be stored m the lexicon  , while at the same time avoiding roles that woukl conlribnte to a prolit  ) ration ( ff false alarms during analysis . We 1 ) clieve that the use of lexically overridable intermediate ff  ) rms is a key to strikiug this balance . 
For the purt xsen\[acquiring moqthn logical information about unknown words ma coqms  , however , it is useful tn have a single canonical furm ( citation lorm ) t  ~ ) reach para-dignl , from which all inflected for nls in the paradign t can be derived  . Thus we have opted to extend our language with the not kmel " acquisition-only " paradigms  . These paradigu/s are essentially tiles aute as those used for recognition  ; however , they include extra form rules ( typically sirenchange rules ) to reduce all lexical steins wilh thaA clIism ! COLIN  ( L92 , NAr'rrus , 2328h OLq "199272 PROC . el : COLING92, NANTES , AUG . 2328,1992 paradigm to a single citation stem . The intleritance provi-sions of PDL make it very easy to add sucb paradigms  . 
I lowever , any lemum created nring I heacqnisition procedure nsing an acquisition-only paradigm must be nlappe to ikseqnivalent leln mabase dou I he corresponding recognition-thne paradigm  . This iuvolves generating tile extra lexical stems required by I here cgnition-lime paradigm  , so that these stems , in addition to tile citation stem , call be stored directly ill the lexicon . 
Several traditionally problematic aspects of German morpholtlgy have proved problematic for our fllrnlalism as well aod welulve adoptex l extensions totile language to acconm date henl  . Modeling tile stem changes revolving German " l . lmlantmtg " ( FI'ROST90\] ) has required tb cal-dition of a variable mappiug function totile spccificatinn of orthographic rales  . German separablc prefixes are handled via tile use of an affix variable  , which retainstile value of these parable prefix for later unificalion with tilese parable-pretix f cature of potential lexical stems  .

While we expect storen lost COlO-ponnds directly in Ih clexicon  , we arc looking rote henris-tics Ibranalyzing componnds that minimize the number of probes needed into our secondary slorage lexicon  . 
6 Conclusions
Our experience so far with PDL bassuplx nted our hy-poflles is that organizing moqllllogical behavior in terms of hierarchically related inflectiom dpam dignls belps to explicitly characterize tile similarities and differences among classes of words an I makes it easier tl capture in a COIICISB and transparent lallller tile kinds of word for nla-tion rules describxtiu many gralninar books  . The language C all be compiled into a form anlenable to efficieut analysis and generation with a dynamic secondary Stlrage lexiclm  , Future work includes further " tuumg " of existing n desets  , extending our coverage of European languages , and interfacing the inflectional system with roles fled-vational moq  ) hology and compouuding .
