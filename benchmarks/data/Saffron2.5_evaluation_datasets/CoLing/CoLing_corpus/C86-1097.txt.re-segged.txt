CRITAC ( CRI Tiquing using AC cumulated knowledge ) is an experimental expert system for proofreading Japanese text  . 
It detects mistypes , Kana-to-Kanjim is conversions , and stylistic errors . This system combines Prolog-coded heuristic knowledge with conventional Japanese text processing techniques which involve heavy computation and access to large language databases  . 
1. Introduction
Current advances in Japanese text processing are mainly due to the remarkable growth of the word processor market  . 
Machine readable Japanese text can now be easily prepared and distributed  . This trends purred the research and development of further text processing applications such as machine translation and text-to-speech on version \[   SAKAS8310\]  \[  MIYAG8310\]  . However , some fundamental text processing procedures are missing for Japanese text  . For example , counting the number of words in text is a difficult task since words are not separated by blanks  . 
Our experimental system CRITAC ( CRI Tiquing using AC cumulated knowledge ) tries to overcome Japanese language problems . Proofreading ( or critiquing , to some extent )  \[  CHER80\]  \[  HEIDJ82\] has been chosen as our research domain because it involves many text processing techniques and is one of the most important functions currently required and lacking  . In this paper , we introduce CRITAC concepts and facilities including a conceptual representation f Japanese text called " structured text " to handle meaningful objects  ( e . g . , sentences and words ) and proofreading using heuristic rules for the structured text  . The structured text consists of a set of Prolog \ [   CLOCMS1\] facts and predicates , each of which represents an object or a class of objects in the text  . 
Because of this high-level representation , human proofreading knowledge can be easily mapped into Prolog rules  . Two user-friendly representations of text , called " source " and " KWlC " ( Key-Word-In-Context ) views , are derived from the structured text . CRITAC provides users with editing and proofreading functions defined over these views  . 
The notion of structured text , we believe , is not restricted only to the Japanese language . Discussions on our approach for languages other than Japanese will be given in the Conclusion  . 
2. CRITAC System Overview
In this section we discuss the outline of CRITAC and its underlying concepts  . As shown in Figure 1 , the heart of CRITA Clies in its architecture . It consists of three major components : a user interface  , a preprocessor , and a proofreading knowledge base .

CRITAC Configuration : The preprocessor generates the structured text from given text  . The proofreading knowledge base currently consists of about  30 Prolog proofreading rides for the structured text  . The user interface handles two external views and facilitates the SQL/DS online dictionary server and text compiler  . 
User Interface
The user interface is built upon an editor , an SQL/DS online dictionary server , and a text compiler . 
The Editor and External Views
The editor provide source and KWIC views as user -friendly external text representations  . It facilitates the modification of the text through these views  . During the modification , when a user asks the system to apply the proofreading rules  , diagnostic messages will appear in the screen with possible errors underlined in the text  . 
*** TOPOFFILE *** that it is not firmatted . That is , the original format such as paging and indentations are dropped  . Figure 2 shows an example of a source view screen . 
The KWIC view displays text in the KWIC format which extracts all the content words as keywords from the text and arrange them in their phonetic  ( pronunciation ) order along with their contexts . This is an extremely useful tool for users to find homonym errors\[  YAMAS8310\] caused by arnis con-version ~ and the lack of conlbrmity  ( e . g . , " center " and " centre " in English ) in the text \[ FUJIM8504\] . Since external views are virtual views of the structured text  , updates made by the user are checked and reflected in the structured text through the synchronizing mechanism of updates in two different views  . 
Figure 1 shows a KWIC view . Each line consists of one keyword in the middle , preceding and succeeding contexts are shown on the left and right  .

SQL/DS Dictionary Server
Online access to syst mn dictionaries or an encyclopedia \ [  WEYEB8501\] is one of the most user-fi'i endly facilities in an advanced text processing system  . CRITAC is connected to a dictionary server implemented on SQL/DS  . SQL/DS ( Structured Query Language/Data System\[ IBM8308\]  ) is a relational \[ CODD7006\] database management system . It has been mainly used for business data processing purposes like purchase-order files  . The excellent user language of SQL/DS is based on the relational calculus which can be easily incorporated into Prolog\[  IBM8509\]  . Furthermore , SQL/DS can support multiple access to tables . For example , a user can access tables in terms of KANt1 values or PRONUNCIA-TION values . This greatly enhances the " associative memory " access of online dictionaries  . That is , we can retrieve all the related information by giving some known val-ties  . 
The Japanese word processors currently have limited then mn be r of keys on the keyboard by using the phonetic haracter set  , Hiragana or Katakana , to enter text . Once the pronunciation of a word or a phrase is given  , it will he converted to the most likely Kanji expression  . This process is a Kana-to-Kanji conversion . Because of the large number of homonyms \ [ TANA8310\] in the Japanese language , this conversion is liable to generate an unintended Kanji expression  . This is referred to as misconversion . 
We include some " canned " queries to the dictionary  . A typical access pattern is searching for homonyms as shown in the section " A Sample CRITAC Session "  ( Figure 10 )  , which helps users correct misconversions . 
Canned queries also include synonyms , antonyms , related words , and upper/lower concept of the given words . The conceptual hierarchy of words is obtained from the following combined SQL queries  . 



X . CATEGORY--NUMBER
SEMANTIC-CLASSIFICATION-TABLE
X . KANJI = given Word

Get the stem number of the returned category - number  . 
X . CATEGORY-NUMBER is like "1.2.39".

WHEREX . KANJI=Y . KANJI
ANDY.CATEGRY-NUMBERlAKE'stemNum %'
ORDERBY CATEGORY2 qUMBER
The first query returns the category number , say " 1 . 2 . 39" , from a table called " SEMANTIC-CLASSIFICATION -TABLE " We need a stem number  ( "1" in this case ) of this category . The stem nmnber is then used to find the words whose category number has the same stem number  . This is what the second query retrieves . The result is arranged by the category number . 
Note that users can make use of not only canned queries but also ad hoc queries  . Since the SQL query language and the conceptual scheme of the dictionaries are easy to understand  , users can make queries like those above to get ad hoc information  . Such a set of customized queries is also stored in SQL/DS  . Users can also define views for dictionaries to rename and select columns as well as records  . 
The Text Compiler
CRITAC also provides a " text compiler " facility . It is analogous to the compilers of programming languages  . The user gives text to this text compiler and the compiler can provide the following  . 

A source list of text and diagnostic messages with line reference n m nbers  . 
A list of segments and Kanji primitive words with their occurrence counts and pronunciation  . A cross-reference list of words and text ( KWOC : Key Word Out of Context ) and other useful statistics can also be obtained . 
Various formats of the text including KWIC format . Additional information ( word boundaries , pronunciation , etc . ) may be added to the text . If an application uses a specific format , the text compiler can be made to generate application input in this tbrmat  . 


The preprocessor decomposes continuously typed Japanese text into a sequence of tokenized primitive words and particles  . A basic object of Japanese sentence is a content word followed by zero or more function words  , which is called a segment or a phrase ( see\[MIYAG8310\] , for example , for more details ) . This preprocess is required because Japanese text has no explicit delimiters  ( blanks ) between words . 
The preprocessor also gathers such information as pronunciation  2  , parts-of-speech , total number of occnrrences in the text and base form  , etc . , associated with each of the words and particles . This information together with the original text is stored as a set of Prolog facts to be used for later processing  . We illustrate the steps of the preprocess ( see Figure 4 )  . 
\[ Japanese Text Preprocessing \]1 . Japanese text is a collection of sentences . Each sentence is just a continuou string of characters  . 
2 . A segmentation algorithm is applied to the sentence  . This algorithm contains about 100 heuristic rules each of which specifies the cases where a segment boundary usually appears  . The accuracy of this segmentation algorithm is about  97  . 5% . 
3 . Content words in the segments are recognized by looking them up in a primitive word dictionary  . If a content word is a compound word , it is decomposed into primitive words . Since many Kanji compound words have ambiguities of decomposition  , we apply a stochastic estimation algorithm and a Kanji primitive word dictionary with statistics\ [   FUJI8509\] to find the most likely decompos-ition . Our algorithm is obtained from stochastic estimation algorithms in \[  FORN7303\]  , \[BAHLJ8303\] , and \[ FUJI8407\] with slight modification . The accuracy of our algorithm is about 96 . 5% . 
4 . Function words in each segment are identified . The connectivity of these function words is described by an automaton \[  OKOC8112\]  . A correct sequence of function words is obtained by observing the transition over this automaton  .

Figure 4 . Preprocessing Japanese Text 2 Roughly speaking , Katakana and Hiragana characters are phonetic and each of them corresponds to one phoneme  . Kanji characters are ideographic and there is a many-to-many mapping between the Kanji character set and a set of phoneme sequences  . 
The preprocess starts with given text at step 1 above . The text . 
is gradually analyzed and decomposed into fragments at the succeeding three steps  . Details of the algorithms used here are beyond the scope of this paper  . 
The above high level objects ( segments and words ) of Japanese text are conceptually expressed in terms of four types of facts and three types of predicates as shown in Figure  5  . We map < segment > , < content word > , < function word > , and punctuations into the facts : seg0 , head ( ) , tail ( ) , and punc0 . Other fragments of text can be defined from those basic facts  . This is called structured text . 
seg(1 , J , K , X ) A character string X is the Kth segment in the J -th sentence of the I-th paragraph  . 
I , J and K denote the same indexes below.
head(I , J , K , U , Y , G , L ) U is a content word ( possibly a Kanji compound word ) of the segment X above , with pronunciation Y and part-of-speech G . L is a list of labels to denote prefixes , primitive words and suffixes in U if U is a Kanji compound word  . 
tail(I , J , K , V , H ) pune(I , J , K , D ) sent(I , J , S ) para(l , P ) text ( T ) V is a list of function words in the segment X and the part-of-speech of the last function word is H  . 
D is either a period or a comma of the segment X if any  . 
Sisa-sequence-of segments seg(I,J,K,X).
Pisa-sequence-of sentences sent(I,J,S).
Tisa-sequence-of paragraphs para(I , P).
Figure 5 . Types of Facts and Predicates fortile Structured Text : First fbur predicates are facts t bat represent basic objects in Japanese text  . The rest of predicates represent derived fragments of the text  . 
The structured text enables us to generate two external views in the previous subsection  ( Figure 6 )  . The mapping between the structured text and source view is straightforward  . The KWIC view can be denoted by the following symbols  . 
Segl . lSegl . 2  . . . Segl . k Lt Keyt Taill Segt , kl-ll . . . SegI,wISeg2,tSeg2 . 2  . . . Seg2k2tKey2Tail2Segze2+l . . . Segzw 2 . . ?  . .  . .  . .  . .

Segij is a shorthand notation for a segment X appeared in the ith row of the KWIC view satisfying seg  ( pi , s , j , X ) for some p ~ and s ~ . Each sentence of the text appears in the KWIC view as many times a stile number of its segments becaus each segment has one keyword to appear in a distinct row in the view  . For example , the first sentence appears three times in the KWIC view of Figure  6  . Keyx equals the content word of Seg . ~ . k . ~ and T ~ . is the remaining function words of Segx . kx .

Proofi'eading Knowledge Base
CRITAC proofreading rules are written in terms of the facts and predicates including those used for the structured text  , and builtin predicates \[ IBM8509\] . There are two types of rules : source rules and KWIC rules  . By source rules we mean those rules which involve qualification over segments  , content words , and function words in the source view of text . The KWIC rules in w ) lve the qualification of adjacent keywords as well as their ordering  . 
Source Rules
One category of source rules aims at finding excessively complicated or ambiguous noun phrases  . This is effective in the Japanese language environnrent because the Japanese grammar allows nouns and some particles to be strung together into a long sequence  , and such sequences are used frequently . Basically we have two types of phrases to detect : one is repeated noun modifiers of the same kind and the other is an ambiguous dependency among segments  . For example , phrases like MyMother's Father's Company's Location is  . . . 
( repetition of possesive noun phrase )
Applying equations/1 or B and C , ( too anrbiguons modification ) are detected . 
Another category of source rules aims at detecting typographical errors and inconsistent use of words  . Some sample proofreading rules are A rule for detecting incorrect ending of sentences rule  ( ' terminatiw ; ') <- tail(I , J , K , T , H ) & end-of-sentence ( E ) & category ( 'terminative' , H ) & NOT punc(I , J , K , E ) & warning1('missing punctuation ' , I , J , K) . 
This rule scans the function words of text . If a segment ends with a flmction word ( the last : element of the list T in " tail " )  , which usually implies the " end-of--sentence '   , but is not followed by a punctuation mark ( period ) E , then give a warning to the author . 
A rule for detecting an inconsistent use of numeric prefixes-One is Alphabetical prefix and another is Chinese numeric prefix rule  ( ' numbers ' ) <- head ( ll , JI , KI , U 1 , YI , GI , L 1 ) & number -- prefix ( KI , L 1 , Pl , W1) & head(I2 , J2 , K2 , U2 , Y2 , G2 , L2) & number-prefix(K2 , L2 , P2 , Wl ) & char--type ( P1 , T1) & char-type(P2 , T2) & ne(Tl , T2) & warning2('numbers' , II , Jl , Kl , I2 , J2 , K2) . 
This rule detects the inconsistent usage of Kanji and Roman numeric prefixes for some content word  . if some primitive word Wl is preceded by numeric prefixes  P1 and P2 denoting the same numbers but not of the same character type  , then give a warning to the author . " Number-prefix ( K , L , P , W ) ' succeeds if there is a number prefix P preceding a primitive word W in the compound word K  , where the constituent types are listed in L . " Char-type ( P , T ) " succeeds if a 2-byte character string P consists of only one character type  ( " Kanji " , " Hiragana " , " Kanakana " , or " Roman ") or if P is " mixed " . 
KWIC Rules
KWIC rules , in contrast with the source rules , refer to keywords of the KWIC view rather than the " segment " or " head " above  . 
In the KWIC view , as explained in the previous subsection , if Keyj . . . . . Keyk is the phonetic ordering , homonyms are arranged adjacently . This greatly reduces the time to detect homonym errors  ( conversion errors ) because the system only has to scan the keywords Keyionce to examine the pronunciation of Key ~ and Key ~  , and possibly some other local conditions . For example , we can express possible conversion errors as follows  . 
415 rule KWIC ( ' misconversion ' ) <- is-ordered ( ' pronunciation ' ) & key ( I1 , U1 , YI , G1)& next-key(I1 , U2 , YI , G2) & ne(UI , U2) & pred(I1 , P ) & pred(I2 , P ) & succ(I1 , S ) & succ(I2 , S ) & waming KWIC (' misconversion ' , I 1) . 
If there are distinct keywords U1 and U2 with the same pronunciation Y1 in the same context P ( preceding primitive word ) and S ( succeeding primitive word )  , then one of them is possibly a misconversion . " Key(I , U , Y , G ) " is Key ~= U with pronunciation Y and lexical category G  . 
" Next-key(I , U , Y , G ) " unifies with key(I1 , U , G , Y ) such that
II = I + l.
If Key ~, . . . , Keyk are ordered either by their preceding or succeeding word  , we can detect some lack of conformity in word usage  . For example , if keywords are ordered by their succeeding words  , the following case will be detected . 
.. be a spelling error in such cases.,.
.. can find style errors as well as , ..
.. to detect stylistic errors in the text ...
ruleKWIC ( ' inconsistency ' ) <- ordered ( ' successor ' ) & key ( II , U 1 , Yl , Gl ) & next-key(II , U2 , YI , G2) & ne(Ul , U2) & stem(U1 , S ) & stem(U2 , S ) & warning KWIC('inconsistency ' , II ) . 
Here we assume both stem (' style ' , ' style ') and stem (' stylistic ' , ' style ') are successful . 
3. A Sample CRITAC Session
This section illustrates a typical CR1TAC session consisting of four actions . That is , 1 . Detect an error in the source view ( Figure 7) . 
2 . Display the explanation of the error ( Figure 8) . 
3 . Locate the error candidate in the KWIC view ( Figure 9 )  . 
4 . Get the homonyms of a keyword by invoking the dictionary server  ( Figure 10 )  . 
These actions are implemented as basic functions of the system  . Locating a word of interes ~ in different views will efficiently help users judge the system -detected rrors to be real errors or not  .

4. Conclusion
We have introduced a Japanese text proofi'eading system CRITAC based on the text preprocessing and Prolog-coded knowledge representation  . The user interface of CRITAC is developed based on the following concepts  . 
0 support of external views of text for users ? SQL/DS ottline dictionary server ? text compiler Although CRITAC is initially designed for the Japanese language  , the authors believe it can be applied to other languages as well  . For example , the KWIC view can be applied to detect conversion errors in any kind of text prepared by phonetic -toqdeographic conversion or voice-input methods  . The notions of structured text and preprocessing not only add textual information to the original text to resolve the overhead of applications but also give a high-level view of the text  . The application designer no longer has to code his/her own lexical analyzer that deals with character strings  . They are replaced with higher objects such as segment  , sentence , or paragraph . 
We also believe that CRITAC as a domain-specific ( or application-specific ) interface to applications ( e . g . , document retrieval or machine translation ) will help users define a set of valid input by heuristic rules in addition to a grammar  . 
Rules of CRITAC can filter out or rewrite some portions of the text and guarantee appropriate text to be given to the applications  . 
Future work includes
O Evaluation of the system with respect to accuracy  , usability and so on . 
@ A simple grammar checking based on case grammar \[   FILL68\]  . 
SQL/DS cn hancement of dictionary server facilities . 
SQL/DS can also be used to manage the document \ [ MISE8103\] itself . 
? Interface to other applications such as a machine translation system or a text-to-voice generation system  . 

We are grateful to Hiroshi Maruyalna for building a prototype of the CRITAC knowledge base and for many valuable discussions  . We also wish to thank Tetsuro Nishino for implementing a complicated noun analyzer on a CRITAC prototype  , M . Arthur Ozeki for his assistance in developing proofreading rules  , and Linore Cleveland and Kaoru Hosokawa for their helpful comments on the earlier draft of this paper  .
