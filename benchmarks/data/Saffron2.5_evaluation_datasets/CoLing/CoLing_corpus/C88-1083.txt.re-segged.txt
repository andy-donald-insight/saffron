The language of classical proposition aliog-Ic is extended by functorial variables as a new syntactical category  . Functorial variables render to be a possible integrating representation of both assertion and presupposition in one and the same logical formula different from such using classical conjunction  . 
O ~ Introduction
From a computational point of vlew there is an important difficulty of an adequate formalization of both assertion and presupposition  , It rests on dividing utterances into an explicit part  ( assertion ) and an implicit one ( presupposition )  . 
Frege 118921 refused any explication of this implicit part , because of hlside all za = t/on that logic deals only with correct ~ tate merl ts  . At least in regard of definite descriptions Russell  /1905/ pleaded for such an explication . But classical conjunction was one of its essential formal tools  . To a certain extent assertion and presuppoeltion were represented at one and the same level  . 
Straws on /1950/ claimed that presuppositions have to be exp licated  , but not at the same level like the implic it part  . Many linguists = e,g . Klefer 11973/ -believe that logical means can be used to represent both parts of utterances ae parately ~ but these representations cannot be put together in one and the same logical exprees lon ~ because Russell's solution Isunsatis factory  . 
My intention is to show that functor lalvar iables render to be possible tools for in tegrating representation of both assertion and presupposition in one and the same logi- cal formula  , Moreover-unlike Bergmanni 1981/ , Oungl K Ostner /19861 -this representation Is a svntact l calone and different from that given by means of classical con-Junction  ( cp , Maxl 1986/i/forthcoming /) .

Introducing such variables we get a whole class of syntactical extensions of the classical propositional logic  . Only functor lalvarlable e of the following form are considered = 
G ~= gi_I ~ f,g ~16.
The f's and g's are called components . The f-component ( g-component ) is called first ( second ) component . 
are values of 2Semantically , ~ and ~ gG2 the functorial variables f , g . Therefore these functor lalvariables ( abbreviation = FV's ) represent eats of functors wl the xact two ( not necessarily different ) elements . Wlth respect to an intuitive interpret at ionFV'e=unite " the properties of both functore  .

The rul ~ , s of substitution of G are formulated in such a manner that  ( a ) the p-propo-sitions , 1 var iab les and the q - propos i t iona l var iab les occur r ing in G-formulae act as va-r iab les of a d i f fe rent eort =  1  , s ? in any case the former occur on the left . and the latter on the right in formulae of the form G  2   4   , 6 piqil(b ) they have the same index ; and ( C ) the rels no ' rule of substitution which a llows the substitution of more complex for -mules for propositional variables with in G-formulae  , In the case of K-formulae we have the usual ru le of substitution  . 
Connection conditions of FV's =
NowZ explain how several FV's occurring in the same formulae reconnected  , The condi-tions of connection are chosen in such a way that every formula containing FV ? e represents exactly two formulas without FV*s =   ( 1 ) Let AG be a G-formula of G . I define both FV-free formulas in two steps =   ( S ) Let G ~ , g be the matn-FV of AG . Then AG1AG/G2/~2~AG1=dr~f,g,pf~t . e . is the formulao which results by substitut ion of ~ for G~g  ,  \]

The formulae AGE lendA GE2 generated by this method dlffer only in them af n-functor  . They are both K-formulae . 
AG/AGEl and AG/A GE2 are abbreviations for all substitutions in AG which generate AGE l and 
AGE2. respectively.

2? Re la t ions to c lass ica l l og ic My system is semantically equivalent  .   . w . ith the . F ! aa elcal PrOPO Sitional logic in the sense that all FV ' e can be eliminated by replacing every formula A of G by the conjunction of it s both closed substitutions  , t . e ? A E1 endA E2- In this manner we gets complete and consis tent system of classical logic  . It hoZds = A formula A of Glsvalid lffi ts corresponding classical formula  AE1A A E2 is valid . 
There are some specific differences between the starting formula with FV'e and i tsanalo-gous formula without FV ' eo One important dif-ference is the following = After replacing the propositional variab les by values  1 or 0 the formula A gets none of these values and it remains  , upeatured . Only if this formulals transmitted in one of its both closed substi-tutions-AE$ or A  E2  -  , then it gets evalue . 
With respect to formulas with FV's which are ne it hert autologies nor contradictions there is another Important difference : Let Abei snot valid  ,  3 , Assertion and presupposition The introduction of expressions of the form G ~  , 6Plq i _ renders to be a possible unconventional approach to assertion and presupposition  . I postulate that the p-propositional variables represent elsments of a set of assertions  , and the corresponding q-variables represent elements of a set of presuppositions  . The FVG 24 , 6 constitutes an ordered sequence of both sorts of propositional va-tla~s-:-~preeup poslt ion component ! piq~i presupposltion expression :  ~2plql 
G2, (~ Plql~---ql)
IL-J-J--~assertlon expression : ~2plql -- assertion component ( ~2piqi ~ pi ) Concerning logical relations between several sentences both assertions and presuppositions can influence this relation  . In order to forms correct translation of such compound sentences their simple parts should be translated into expressions of the form G  2   . Let AG be a G-formula of G . Then 4 , 6Piql we can put on the following generalization of our interpretation: 
AGE l.-assertion expression
AGE2-presupposition expression.
Sows get a new syntactical method to expli-cate assertion and presupposition in one and the same formula  . Unlike 4-valued/2-dimen-sional approaches our language possesses an enrlchment of syntactical expressive power  . 
4. FV's and functors
The explication of both assertion and presupposition by means of formulas of the form  ( plql ) dlffers from that one by means of clasel cal conjunction  , because ( Plql)---(PiAql ) is not valid . 
Because of
TI : ( PiAql ) ~( Plql ), end
T2: ( plql ) ~ ( pl  V  ql ) the representation by means of G2 is 4 , 6 stronger than that one by conjunction , but it is weaker than that one by disjunct ion  . 
5. Negations
Because of presupposition-rejecting negation.
G213 , 6 can be interpreted as Presuppoeitlon-~resefving negation  , because , 222 G~3 , 6 ( ""  . r - - ~ 1 3 ~ 4P l q l ~ 6 p l q l ~ P l
