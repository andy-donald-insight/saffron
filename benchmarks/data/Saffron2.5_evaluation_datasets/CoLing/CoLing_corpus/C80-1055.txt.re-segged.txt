In the past years we have been applying semantic ATN-grammars-as introduced by Brown & Burton  ( 1974 ) -to natural language question-answering tasks ( e . g . a LISP-Tutor\[Barth ,  1977\] , s question-answering system about the micro-world of soccer\[Rathke & Sonntag  ,  1979\]) . We found that semantic grammars execute efficiently  , but become large very quickly even with moderate domains of discourse  . We therefore looked for ways to support parsing by domain-dependent knowledge represented in an inheritance network \[ Lauhsch  , IQTQT . In this paper we first briefly describe our representation language Ohj talk  , and then illustrate how it is used for building an understanding system for processing German newspaper texts about the job market situation  .

Concepts as active schemata
We have developped an object-oriented representation language called  0bjTalk -in which objects are framelike data structures which have behavioral traits and communicate through message passing  . The objects ( classes and instances ) are organized into a ( multiple ) inheritance hierarchy .   0bjTalk is an extension to Lisp and was inspired by SMALLTAL ~\[ Goldberg & ~ ay  ,  1976\] , VRL\[~oberts & Coldstein ,  1977\] , and KLONE\[Braehman ,  1978\] . 
An inheritance net of objects ( with the root class Object ) is constructed by sending the message NEW : to the class CLASS  , i . e . a concept definition in ObjTalk has the form : ( ASKCLASSNEW : < concept-name >
SUPERC(<concept-name 1 > ...)
GENERIC-PROPERTIES < slot-name >: < filler -description> 
ME~HODS < method-name > :\[< filter >=> < body >\ ] ~ RIGCER-ATN < Trigger-keys >  ; attached ATN\[<subATN-node > < production >\] . . . ) The effect of sending NEW : to CLASS is to define a class with the given < concept-name > as a subclass of the named superelass  ( es )  . Instances are made by sending the concept a message that causes to fill its slots with fillers which satisfy the filler description  . If an object receives a message , this will be matched against the method-filters . In case of success the corresponding method's body will be evaluated  . 
Concepts inherit methods and generic properties fro ~ their superclass  ( es ) recursively up to the root node Object ( which implements the system-defined messages )  . Objects may be further specified dynamically by adding slots or methods  , or filling slots . 
For schema-driven parsing , a semantics uh ATN should be activated whenever a particular word is found  , or concept is expected . The basic mechanism is to attach trigger-key8 to a schema that state which words 364--which words or concepts make a schema active . 
Once active it puts the named subATN-nodes in a preferred aetivatable state  . The ATN-machine has been extended to prefer PUSH arcs from nondeterministic states if they are activatable  . This is implemented by primitives for activating a subATN  , deactivating an active one , and a test for activation . 
The suhATNs of the trigger-at n form ( or those ones in filler descriptions ) are made activatable if ( I ) a concept has been partially instantiated ( an instance of this concept or one lower in the hierarchy was made  , but not all obligatory roles are filled ) , or ( 2 ) one of the concepts mentioned in trigger-keys has been instantiated  , or (5) one of the words mentioned in trigger
Mys was found by the scanner.
Arc actions of the ATN may send messages to concepts  , and thus ( partially ) instantiate a concept . 
Application to newspaper understanding
We are currently applying ObjTalk to understanding newspaper reports about the joh market situation  . Reports of this kind are highly stereotypical : They describe the present job market situation in terms of a few attributes and their respective changes  . These indicators are interpreted and discussed within the framework of a simple model of job market fluctuations by officials of the issuing organization  . Sometimes the data are also commented upon by political speakers of different views  . 
Job market reports are prototypical for related " official statistical reports "  ( e . g . 
developments of population , crime , stock market etc . ) . These articles are differing in structure and contents  ( data , values , changes , explanantions , interpretations ) from the more " event"-oriented newspaper-texts of DeJongs ~ RI~P\[  Iq79\] and Cullingfords SAM \[1978\]  . 
~ he knowledge base
We have built a knowledge base of ( Obj Talk- ) concepts in order to proess news articles of this type  . The design was guided by the principle of providing an active schema for everything that would be considered a " the ma " in the reports  . 
The most global frame is the one for " job-market -situation "  ( jms )  . It combines in its roles all what would " normally " be reported in our texts and should therefore be expected by the system : time  , region , relevant aspects or indicators - i . e . jobless-rate , open-jobs , new employments . . .  -  , explanations for the general situation , general predictions .   ( Think of a jms-frame as a " snapshot " of the job market-developments  ; Schankian people may think of it as analoguous to a script  )  . 
The relevant aspects are in a sense constituting the jm s  , technically spoken : are in a part of relation to the jms-frame  . Their frames themselves are combined from frames for the static and the dynamic part of the job market-factor  , i . e , an index - and an index-change-frame . Each concept for an individual job market-aspect also involves encoded knowledge for a  ( specific levaluation , explanation and prediction . 
The common traits of the individual jm-indices are organized in the jm-index-fr sme  , which itself inher its knowledge ( slots ,  . . . ) from a more general index-frame that combines the shared traits of all such indices  ( cf . above ) . 
This organization should later allow easy extension of the system  . 

Parsing the sentence " DIEZAHL DERARBEITSLOSEN YNENGL ANDISTIM 
MAYUM 14000AU~1,509 MILLIONEN
ZURUECKGEGANGEN " ( "THE~MBEROFI~EMPLOYED PERSONSINENG LAND HAS DECREASE DYN MAY BY  14000 TO 1  , 509 MILLYON " ) would cause the following instances to be created and included into the static and dynamic roles of the resp  . jm-sspect : 365-jobless-index-1= ( a jobless-index with region: ( England ) value : ( I . ~09 million ) time : ( DATE~I5 80 ) sex : ( AND MALE FEMALE ) job types : ( ALLJOBTYPES ) changes : change-jobless-index-1? ,   .   ) change-jobless-index-1= ( a change-of-index with ref . - index : jobless-index-1 time-new : ( DATE~I5 80 ) time-old: ( DATE~O4 80 ) time-interval : ( DATE-YNT 580 ) value-new: ( ~ . 5 Oqmillion ) value-old : (1 . 52 ~ million ) change-abs: ( -14000 ) change-qual : ( DECREASE ) evaluation : ( POSITIVE )  ?  .   ,   )   ( The last inference is done by a method of class jobless-index which says that for this index DECREASE is evaluated positively  ; this rule does of course not hold for e . g . the open-jobs-index ) . 
Schemata for argumentations
Statements about facts are often followed by explanations given by an official person  . Such statements are recognized and dealt with by a schema called " interpretation " which is activatable e  . g . by verbs like the German " erklaeren " ( " declare " )  . 
The interpretation schema has as roles : fact : ( OR ( CLASS jm-indicator )   ( CLASS jm-situation ) ~speaker : ~ ( CLASS official/person ) object : ( CLASS explanatory/statement ) 
The object of an interpretation is an explanatory statement  , which has roles for a manifest fact and supporting reasons  . The system has an elementary knowledge about ( jm-specific ) economic dependencies ( e . g . decrease in the jobless rate in the time interval from March to May may be due to seasonal effects  )  , and uses this to identify resp . utterances as reasons in an explanatory statement . 
Guiding ATN control through schemata
The kernel of our grammar consists of semantic ATNs particular to role fillers of  ( 0 bjTalk-~concepts . In general , the parser tries to use the most specific subATN possible  , and only falls back onto a syntactic subnetif no expectations are active  . 
The semantic subATNs may be rather idiosyncratic ( like the one for NP/job market/official/person to handle phrases like " DERPRAESID ~ NT DER BUNDES ANSTALT ~\[ ~ RARBEITINNUERNBERG  , JOSEFSTINGL . . . ") and are organized hierarchically . 
They may be used by diverse concepts with similar slots  . The value returned via the POP arc of a subnet may be used directly as filler for the triggering slot  . A more general interface between the ATN results and the slots of a schema is provided by the productions in the trigger-at n form  . The production filters out those parts of an ATN result that fit as role-fillers of the concept  . 
Writing semantic ATNs is simplified by the chance to specify only one generic PUSH arc  ( e . g . NP ) that processes a class , instead of the possibly large set of more specific ~\[ SHes  ( e . g . 
NP/PERSON , NP/OFFICIAL/PERSON , NP/JOB MARKET/
OFFICIAL/PERSON , ...).
If the parser is in the starting state of such a generic PUSH and a schema is active whose roles are to be filled by semantic subATNs  , then those standing in subclass relation to the generic PUSH are preferred  . E . g . , if an unfilled slot expects a N~/0FFICIAL/PERSON   , and the parser expects a NP , then , since NP/OFFICIAL/PERSON is a specialisation of NP  , it is activated and-in case of success-the result is used to fill that slot  . 
In general , several schemata can be active at a time , in the sense that some of their slots are unfilled  .   ( In other words : There may be several " thematic expectations " looking for further information in the article  )  . Then all of the attached subATNs are activatable . It is possible that an expected subATN succeeds but the result fails to meet a filler -restriction  ( or even does not match the production )  . This is treated like a failure of the subATN itself  . 

An informal parse
The following example-slightly shortened from a real news note-is intended to give a flavor of how knowledge base and parser processes cooperate in analysing a joh market report :>> DIEZAHL DER ARBEIT ~ LOSEN  . .
( The number of unemployed ..)
This triggers the concept for a jobless-index and , since there is no one active yet , instantiates a job market-situation as context for further processing  . Within it , the jobless-index becomes the static part of the reap  . jms-aspect-frame . 
> > .. VERRINGER TESICH .. (.. decreased..)
An instance of change-of-index for jobless-index is created  ( because verbs like " decrease " are attached to index-changes  ) and identified as the expected dynamic part of the still active jms-aspect  . 
> >.. LASSEKEINEKON ~ JNKTURELLEN AUFTRIEBS-
KRAE~TEMEHRER MENNEN , ..
( . . does not show any signs of economic recovery , . . ) Since the manifest fact may be explained by economic recovery or other reasons  , the intent of this statement is to exclude the former explanation  . The exclusion of a reason activates a more general argumentation schema which now demands that a positive explanation must follow  ( at least in well written texts )  . 
>>  . . DER RUECKCANC DER ARBEITSLOSICWEIT SEI NUR AUF SAISONALEEIN ~ JESSE ZURUECKZUFUEHREN  . 
( . . the decrease in jobless rate is only caused by seasonal influences  . ) The first part repeats the manifestation ( and is optional )  , and the second part claims seasonal effects as reason for it  . ~his explanation is confirmed by one of our inference rules  ( time-interval is May ) about the relations between season and changes in job market-indices  . This finally allows to fill the reason slot of the explanatory statement  . 
> >.. INMAIi ~58000 AUF 766000.
(.. in may by q8000 to 766000.)
Various unfilled slots in the active jobless-index and change-of-index schemas are filled by successfully processed particular 
PP-nets attached to those slots ( e.g.
PP/TIME-INT for time-intemral ) , some slots get their default values , which reflect newspaper conventions of " what is known without having been said "  ( e . g . the region slot gets " western germany ") . 
>> DERPRAESIDENT DERBI~DES ANSTALT FUERARBEIm,
JOSEPHST ! NGL , ERKLAERTE ...
( The president of the federal employment office , J . S . , declared . . . )
This leads to the instantiation of an interpretation frame  ( which itself will fill the explanation slot of the jms-aspect  ) with the named official filling the speaker slot , and makes thus a schema for an explanatory statement active  . Slots to be filled here are a manifestation and reasons  . 
> >.. DIEENT WICKL UNCA MARBEIT SMARZ T..
( . . the development on the jobmarket . . ) This refers to the previously built change of jobless-index  ( as-by default-central aspect of jms -developments and - in this context-only " development " talked about so far \]  . It becomes filler for the manifestation slot .
