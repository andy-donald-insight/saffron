Abstract i
\] ~ e describe the linguistic background of a Czech -to-Russian ~ T system  , stressing its features resulting from the closed relatedness of the two languages  , above all the pos-sibility of a minimization of the transfer  . 
Related linguistic problems are analyzed within the MT project  , as well as in the perspective of contrastive linguistics  . 
1 . The system of Czech-to-Russian MT system called RUSLAN is conceived ruimilarly as all l inguistically based MT systems  ) as a modular system consisting ( in brief ) of a source language parser , a tranfer and a synthesis of the target language . The task is to translate texts from the domain of computers  , in particular manuals of operating systems . 
Since in RUSLAN the source language is closely genetically related to the target one  , some of the modules of the system could have been considerably simplified  , not leaving out of consi4eration the theoretical linguistic framework on which t\ ] ~ e system is based  ( dependency and stratific at lonal approach )  . The simplifications concern , first of all , the transfer phase , so that the system cannot be understood as including a complete transfer  . 
2 . The effort towards a maximally effective procedure has also resulted in simplifi- cations in the  2arser   . This was made possible i . a . by the similarity of cases of syntactic ambiguity in the source and the target language  . For example , with sequences of the type Verb Noun IN oun 2 . . . Nouni , where each Noun j stands for a nominal or a prepositional group serving as a free modifier  , the surface order can generally be preserved , which fact makes unnecessary a detailed ident if ication whether any of the Noun ~' s modifies the Verb or one of the preced in ~ Nouns  . This can be illustrated by the output Russian sentence " Vovrem jasvoej raboty programmamo ~ et po-trebovat'tak~e  pomo~6" sistemy priobrabotke failer dannych . "( Lit . "Incourse of-lts work program can need also help of-system in processing of-files of-data  . "), where the group " priobrabotke . . . " can be analyzed ( in both languages ) as modifying the verb " potrebovat "' or the nouns "  pomo~5"" or " sistemy " . If the order of the nominal groups is preserved , the translation also preserves the structural ambiguity of the original  . Also nominallza-tions can be translated independently of their underlying structure  ( e . g .   , " Indeksno-posledo vaternyje fa Jlyneobcho dimodo obra-botki preobrazovat '  . "-llt . " Index-sequential files have-to-be before ~ rocessi__~transfor-med  . " , or " Programmy , napisannyena Jazyke Assembler vramkach pred\[du~6e ~ versii , ne-obchodimos nov a translirovat ' . "- lit . " Programs written in language Assembler in frame -work-of~version have-to-be again compiled  . ") . 
Such an approach made it possible , at first , to minimize the transfer phase in the design of the project  , and then , in the process of realization , the articu\] . a tion of transfer operations into the pax'ser and the synthesis  , which may lead to an impressio ~ that RUSLAN works complete \]  . y without transfer , i . e . , as a direst binary NT system ? In principle , it can be said that the minim : \[- zation of the transfer reflects the empirical fast that the two languages have a lotel ~ common features  . 
3 . A great role is played in RUSLAN by the lexicon . The lexical entry contains maxi-~mum of information  , which is then projected to the syntactic rules ; only the most general behaviour of words is rendered purely by means of syntax  . 
The rules of choice of lexical equivalents include different types of information ? Along with the data on parts of speech and morphemics  , semantic features are listed , and ( esp . with verbs ) also the valency ( subcategorization ) frame ; the valency slots are ac . -- companled by information on their Czech morphemic form as well as that of the corresponding Russian items  ( as an example of their discrepancy might serve the pair " u ~ ivatn ~ co  ( acc . )" vs . " po~zovat~Ja~em(instr ?) "--" to uses tg . " ) . Where pasivization is possi~ble , it is indicated which of the slots ( mostly , but not always expressed by a ecusa-~tire ) is selected as the passive surface sub-Ject , expressed then by nominative . With each of the slots , the semantic features required or excluded for the filler of that slot are indicated  . These features help to identify the fillers , especially in cases of ambigui ~ ty , e . g . in Czech " V~stupnlza ~ izenlnastavi ~ , dkov & nlnapo ~ adovanou hod notu . "  ( lito " Output device sets line-spaclng at required value "  ) the verb " nastavit " ( " set " ) has the following valency frame : Actor ( nom/nom~+Human , + Device ) , Objective ( ace/ace , ~- Con-cr , +Result-of-process , -luman ) , where "+ de ~ notes semantic features such that at least one of them has to be prescott with the filler of the respective slot  , "" denotes semantic features excluded with the filler  , and bold-print denotes Czech/Russian morphological forms  . In this way , the ambiguity of morphe-miccase with " ~& dkov~ni " and " za ~ Izeni "  ( in both cases between nonandace ) can be solved on the basis of semantic features of the " two nouns  . 
3 . 1 The choice of the Russian equivalents for Czech lexical units should reflect also guage so These d ifferences concern also syn-tac'i if cpat '   ;   ; erns ; at least ' the following cases should be dist inguished : as Adj Adj No Uil-?~Ad J Nouncxo: d  ~  , ,';;ov , 9 f ' fdic ~ p ~ ikaz - . .> uprav l ja ju \ [ \ [ i j operator \ ] . it,:datasoutz'olcom and -, . > control operai ; or be Noun -> Adj Noun ex . : poiiit a ~- ~ vy ~ islitel ~ na Jama ~ J . na11% o,~o ompute z . . . . ~, comput ing machine c .

ry , based on algorithmic handling of there -gular productive international affixes  ( with exceptions listed in the main dict ionary  ) and of the orthographic and similar diffe ren-ces  , can be illustrated by the following : as with the suffixes-gig  ( mental ,   , " assembly ") -- ~ ,  . t(agreg /; t , " agl < regate ") , pen-~_(koeficient , " coefficiest ") , - ura(kubatura , " cubicvo--fume ") , an , : l the lexloal components of Greeker Latin opigin  , such as -~_%: af , - ~ ko ~ o_ ~ ( kar -- diograf , " cardiegraph " , elektroskop , " electro-scope ") , the Russian equivalents differ at most in details b ~ with other suffixes of internat ional use  , the Russia \ [ , equivalents correspond in a sys-tematic way to the Czech ones ~ as with -_~  . ~st-2la/'-iK ~ . , C !9 . / . : : : J = Ja .  ,  . : : J = 9 ~ . us/::!z~m,z ~ X n:i/ . - ~ rn;\[it '=!? k?/-4~ . eski ~/ Co to a certain degree also word ~ of Slavo-nicorigin can be handled by a procedure based on correspondences with regular segment pairs such a Sh /?\[ ~  \]'3/~1  , TraT/ToroT(where Ts'l ; and sfo:ranocclusive:krAtkp/korotkij " short "  )  ; such pairs as " brad " (" castle ") vs .

This procedure , and a set of similar f ~% il-soft rules for syntax  , should ensure that the output be basically undel's % and a  . ble . 
/4 . The procedures of syntactie an a \] ys is and synthesis are based on lexical in i ' ormat ~ ion  , including the valency frames o Certain diff iculties arise when filling the slots of ohliga ~ eryadverbials  ( see Panevov\[t , 80 ) with which the forms of a given adverbial type are variable ~ e  . g . " vrA % its ekam " ( "%o return somewhere " ) : " napravo " ( "% other ip ; hi " , adverb ) ~" kproblgmu " ( " to the problem " ~ prepo--sition " k "+ ds /tive  )   , " dobytu " (" into - the flat " , preposition " do'I-l-accusa % J , ve ) etc . 
Snch cases are handled by the parser to g-ether with free adverbials  , only it must be ensured that the obligatory modifier is identified  ( in a case of ellipsis , it is necessary % otake into account the preceding " sentence although often the Czech deletion goes in parallel with that in the corresponding Rus--sian sentence  )  . 
4. flOne of the relevant differences be.
tween Czech and Russian syntax concerns sent -ences with the Czech Ist person plural co:  . . . .
responding to the Russian reflexive form ~: ~ e . g . Czech " Algorit musrez mist ~ ovf ) nibIo\]c ? ~ popisuje mev~stJ6"vs . ussian " Al ?; or J . tmrazme ~ enl jablokovop J . syvaets jsvraz dele 6" ( " The algorithm of dislocation of blocks Js described in Sects  6"  )  . Often a modale ~ . --pression is present : " NAzvyprogz'am~m~erne mayn'tvknihovn~I'vs  . Russian " ! azvanija pro . --grammme\[nonaj % ivbiblioteke " ( " The titles of the programs can be found in the libra-ry "  ) o The linguistic rules underlying the pract ical solution of these problems can have % he following form : NeUnacc VerblstP\]-~N ? unnom Verbref \]  ( N ? unacc ) Verbmodal , IstPlVerb inf ~- ~ ( NO Unnom ) Modal Verbini:' ( " ~' Todal " stands here forsue bexpress : ions as " mo ~ no "  ( " possible " )   , " nado "(" nec~s ~ arv "); parentheses "(" , ' ) " denote the facb that-the Objective is not a l ways obligatory  . 
4 . 2 In some cases the ambig'uity of a Czech sentence corresponds to a sim J  .  \ ]  . arambiguity in Russian . In other cases the ambip ; uity in the two languages is not in such accord ;  . tnce ? This is illustrated by the fell . owing : a . Czech : V 16t@prob ~ . h\] . ojedngn 5 on ozv ~! vaz'J = aT!'j\[~ . 0~!o
Russian : \]:, etompro ~ losove ~, a nije . o ~! ovj ) jr2v?tr:ianteOS ~ ( In summer ~ the negotiations on the new va-- . 
riant of OS took place ?) be Czech :
V16t@prob~hlojednAnlo.p-rf-tz__dn=i_nA?j ! o
Russian :
Letom sove ~ ganie pre ~ Iovo vrem jakaj ! . ~ Lk\]~Io(Insummer , the negotiations took place during vaca ~ ions . ) kept also in Russian or , with nouns having the feature Time , translated as " vovrem ja " with genitive . 
Differences in prepositional construct-ions are found also with the following pairs : c  . Czech : Pricen_~a program upok rabujliv tom to roce  . 

Raboty nad programmoj prodol ~ ajuts jaivf , tomgo du . 
( The works on the program continue also this year . ) d . Czech : Prheena fakult ~ pokra ~ uj ~ iv % omto rote  . 

Raboty na faku ~ tete prodol ~ a juts jaiv 6 tom godu.
( The works at the faculty continue also this year . ) These examples cannot be fully accounted for by means of lexieal information  , neither can they be included into the general scheme of syntactic rules  . It is necessary to have a list of such differences  . 
4 . 3 In translat ing Czech subordinate clauses introduced by such conjunctions as " zda "  , "-li "(" whether ") , " jest li~e "(" if ") , " kdy ~" (" when ") , " dokud " (" till ") , " dokudhe "(" until ") , " pokud "(" as long as ") , some of which are ambiguous , the text can be treated as relatively homogenous  . The functioning of a clause introduced by " zda " or "- li " as a subject can be identified on the basis of the valency of the verb in superordinated clause  , where it is marked whether the verb may take a subordinated clause as its Actor or Objective  . In the other cases , suitable or at least acceptable translations of the conjunctions are as follows : Czech " zda "  , "- li " , " po-kud " , " jest li~e " asRussian " esli " ; Czech " do-kud " , " dokudhe " asRussian " poka " , " pokane " , 
Czech " kdy ~" as Russian " kog da " .
It follows that while it is necessary to work " to a certain degree with the under-lying structure  , in ' the majority of cases the equivalent can be chosen just in accordance with the conjunctions themselves  . 
4 . 4 The Czech verb " btt " ( " to be " ) has several Russian equivalents : the copula " by tTM  , verbs " estTM , " javljat ~ Ja " , " naehoditusja " , " i met ~ ja " . The selection of the equivalent depends on the syntactic context : if the nominal predicate in Czech is in instrumental ease  , then a form of the verb " javl jat ~ ja " is preferred  ; if a local adverbial is present , then the translation " nachodit ~ ja " is at pla - ce  , otherwise the appropriate form of the copula is chosen  ; Of course , another point concerns the translation of " btt " with in idioms  ( " byt'vporjadke " , but " i met ~ javras-porja ~ enii ") . 
4 . 5 The surface behaviour of negat ion is not the same in Czech and JnRussian : in Czech  , even partial negation is often expres-sed as a prefix of the verb  , which gives rise to an ambiguity absent in Russian  , where % hls distinction is always transparent . Some of the examples from our texts are : ao Czech : 
To ant system p~esn~nev ~.
Russian : ~ to go da ~ esistemato , no nezna et.
( Th~s even the system does not know exactly ?) b . Czech : Tabulkanen ~ ulo ~ cnana pevn6m m ~ s t ~ v pam6ti  . 

Tahlicapome ~ aets janena postojan nommestev pamjati  . 
(The matrix is not placed in a fixed posit ion in the st brage  . ) 4 . 6 We assume that the surface order is substant ial ly the same in the two languages  ; the differences concern only such specific cases as  , e . g . , the positions of parts of the complex verb forms or those of certain pro~-nouns and particles which have the character of elitics in Czech  , but usually follow the verb in Russian : a . Czech : . . . vypadalby tak,~e~tabulka obsa hovalafl daje . . . 
Russian : . . . vygl jadel by tak , 5 totablica soderala ~ Zdannye . . . 
( . . . he would look as if the matrix con--tained ( eond . ) data . . . ) b . Czech : Bu demes ev opera ~ n ~ ch syst 6 me chs na ~ it . . . 

Voperacionnych sistemach budems ~ aratsb/a ~ , ' ' '  . .  . 
( In the operating system e ~ we shall try . . . ) The dif ferences described in this section do not concern the structural order  , and there is no danger that ambiguity might arise  . The dislocation of function words and particles can be described by general rules  . 
4 . 7 In 4 . 1 through 4 . 6 we wanted to show what the problems of parsing are if the cor ~ respondences in the underlying structure  , in surface syntax and in the surface order of morphemes are to be made use of  , while the differences are solved ; we also wanted to il ~ lust rate the narrowed , but nonetheless neces--sary role of transfer . 
5 . We wanted to point out that , on the one hand , the closeness of the two languages makes it relat ively easy to find a strategy for an MT system  , since the most complex problems of ambiguities might be partially a-voided  , although , on the other hand , comparative empirical research in the domains of lexicon and of syntax is necessary also for such a pair of languages  . Results of such an approach may be useful in MT , and also in the context of a contrastive comparison of cognate languages  .
