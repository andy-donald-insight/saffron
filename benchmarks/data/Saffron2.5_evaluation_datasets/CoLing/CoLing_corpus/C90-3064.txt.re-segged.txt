Abstract
This paper presents a report processing method with ohj cct-centered semantics  . The syntactic analysis is performed along classical generative principles  , though with a deliberately simple output as a list of index-value doublets  , which the semantic module pr ( messes using methods in an object-oriented framework  . The final representation is made of two types of object-centered structures : llrst  , case-like , event level dated structures corresponding to the Input clauses  ; second , detailed representation f the culTent state of an agent of the reference world  , plus rccordst brtile follow up of a task over time  . Uncertainty , imprecision and prevision are handled using specialized fields  . This framework is applied to the processing of daily naval reports in English  . 
I . Introduction
The objective of the project is the processing of messages in English reporting the daily evolution of n aval situation in the Mediter rane an  . The information extracted is exploited for si tuation monitoring  , maintenance of a historical database , formulation of previsions , and detection of highlights and anomalies . 
A report typically gives information on the activity of oneship during the past  24 hours ; for example : " LaBelle Poulcis performing oceanographical measurement in the northern Mediter rane an  , while moving southat a speed of 5k nots . LaBelle Poule was approx in lately 40 nautical miles south of Ma . rseilleat 10:00, April 14 . " This example exhibits discursive information on the c  . urr cnt activity and movement of the ship and a spatiotemporal plotting relative to a reference location  . 
2 . Representation 2 . I . The taxonomy of ' ~ ermanent objects " The permanent objects  ( Figure 1 ) are relatively per ennial , non-event-based ntities which make up the fixed knowledge background or reference world  . 
They , are :- ships : instances of knownships ; -spatial items : instances of zones and places , plus geographical directions ; action types , down to preterminal cass level ( action instances are created upon parsing , as detailed Imreunder ) . Actions subclass it ~ into activities and

The general structure of a ship frame is : - status  , a boolean ( active/inactive ) -ongoing tasks-completed tasks . This and the preceding field contain pointers to instances of the class " task "  , whose fields are : type ( an activity , start date , intermediate last recorded ) date , enddate and location . 
-temporary information : current location , and , when available : goal , destination , geographical direction , companionship , and speed ;- list of spatiotemporal plottings . 
1333 2.3. Action frame
Actions event-level representation ) are instances of the subclasses of the class " action "  . Modality values are attached : - to the action it self:-temporal aspect : " previsional "  , " underway " , " completed " . 
-degree of certainty : " observed " , " certain " ( meaning given as certain ; this is the default value ) , " probable " , " possible " , ordered by decreasing cert~nty . 
-to the action parameters :- certainty , as above-precision : " exact " , " approximate " 2 . 4 , lr ~ ference procedures The inference procedures , implemented as methods and demons , perform the following tasks : - check and complete new information-manage correspondence between fields  ( e . g , between the " goal " and " ongoing tasks " fields  )  , taking modality values into account-look for better modalities  ( uncertainty , imprecision ) -launch previsions-try to confirm active previsions-signal salient and anomalous points  . 
Previsions can be explicit in the text ( future action ; goal or destination ) , or scenario-related .

' QX-p1'cPIl,Xll > . ll\[l3 . 2 . IV hatis~ted frorns ~ jntact ~ akn cxvledge ? There have been deeply contrasted positions on the role of syntax  . It can be thought of as a fullfledged first stage  , as an auxiliary which is sufficiently informative ven when a complete syntactics t ructure per se  ( e . g . an x-barred tree ) is not built ( conceptual analysis : \[ Schank & Riesbeck 81\] )  , as a co-process in close cooperation with semant ics  ( since SHRDLU )  , as the first in an ordered sequence of increasingly costly means  ( as suggested by \[ Rau & Jacobs87\] , who then list slot-filling involving fi ltering  , heuristics when choices are to be made , and general domain knowledge ) . 
Grossly , syntax in itself carries information on :- constituent ordering and constituent relat ionship-flexion and syntactic function  ( if the grammar is relational )   . 
13 ut more actively , syntactic analysis backed by lexical semant ics  , even if less sophisticated than in LFG or Mel' cuk's model for example  , can play an active part in sorting items out and ascribing them an adequate translation  , as for prepositions with an identical meaning  . In fact , besides applying we il-formedness rules , the analyzer and lexicon can do some rear rangement so as to have the job all prepared for case attribution to function nicely  . 
4. Semantic processing
The system first searches a clause for an action in the verb doubletor  , if the verb has translated as " empty " ( for verbs like " perform " , conduct ") , in the tbllowing noun phrase . The field valuation mechanism of the object environment checks that the action value does belong to the declared domain  . An instance of the action type is created , and the system fills its fields with the values it finds in the second element of the doublets  ; the condition on the first place \[ preposition ) is expressed as a parameter . Domain checking is again performed . A case-like structure is obtained . 
When tile action instance has completed the valuation of its fields  , it pours itself into an existing active task of the same ship if available  , or else into a new task it creates . Temporary data current 3342 direction , destination , speed , company and goal ) are replaced without testing if the new values are different  . If the new action is an activity rather than a movement  , it will either merge into the last recorded task If it is the same or a compatible one  , or will generate a new task , If it is declared to be completed , it is ( re- ) written into the completed-tasks field after its status flag has been set to " In active "  . If it is incompatible with an existing ongoing task  , that task is closed For all of the above , a new modality for an already valuated field will be checked against the existing modality : a " better " modality  ( e . g . certain vs probable supersedes the previous one , whereas a worse one is anomalous and can be signalled  . The processing of the above example thus results in the crcaetion/updating of the following frames  : 
Output lists : (< np , I . a-Belle-Pmfle> . <vp,empty> . < oceanographical met~smement > . < in , northern-Mediterraaean >) .

Related work The principled application of structured object representation to semantic processing had its operation all and marks in Bobrow and Winograd's KPd  , and the systems developed by the Yale AI group ( e . g . \[Schank & Riesbeck 811\] . \[Itirst 87\] proposes an over a U application of the object paradigrn  , including to synta ? , rather in the spirit of Srnall & Rieger 82\]'s and ( Flnck89\]'s word experts . \[ Fargues , Catach , I ) ugourd 86\] use logic grammars , but with a semantic representation based on networks\[Sowa's conceptual graphs  ) rather than fi'ames . 
6. Implementation
The system is implemented in Obj log ( \[ Dugerdil89\] )  , a frame language based on Prolog II and featuring multiple inheritance with points of view  , selective inheritance for value-sharing in relationships other than taxonomical  , and dynamic facets . The grammar Itself is written in Prolog It . A menu-and-mouse interface has been developed for the 
Intex Togation module.
7. Conclusion
I have tried to show that objects are a convenient and efficient way to implement semantic representation as well as analysis in a reasonably small domain  . 
Syntax based on a moderately strict set of wellformedness conditions and some initiative In renaming is an appropriate partner for such a semantic analyzer  .
