Not only ( h ) consumers demand adequated OCU ln ( mtal . ioni , lI . heirln other tongue ; there are also h, . I,/M requirc-lnelfl , s , e . g . , with respect to the upcoming European conllllOll nlark et  ; the product reliability act forces merchants to otl'ercomplete technical doculnentation i the consmner's native language  . The need to provide such a massive amount of multilingual material is likely to exceed both the c~q  ) a cities of human translators as well as those of nm chinetrails-lotion technology currently awdlable  . Our work in the TECIII ) OCl ) roject is motiwtted by the feeling that this situation calls f '  ( )l " investigating a potential alternative : to cz -I  , lOil " , at ' ural language gcncralim~tech'uology in order to help overcome J ~  , edocumentatio . n problem .

On the otller hand , the language that is used in such nlamml . ~telldSto ) e relatively simple ; one mostly finds straiglltf'ot'ward instructions t\]lat have been writt xm with the intention to produce text that can be readily understood by a per-SOilWhOiSexeclltill\[_  , ~SOlliell\];tintenan(:e & ctivity . Moreover , as our initial analyses in the Iirst phase o\[ 'TECIlI  ) O ( ~ had . shown , the strlt clwl'e of nmnua \] sections is largely uniform and an lenahle to l'ormalization  .

These actions are represented as phuls in the I . raditiona . 1A/sense , i . e . with pre - and postconditions , and with recursive structure ( steps call be elaborated through complete refinement plans  )  . 
These representations are mapped onto a language -independent document representation that also captures its microstructure by means of RST relations \[ Mann and Thoml > son  , 1987\] with a number of specilh : annotations ( e . g . , a proposition is to be expressed as an instruction  , giving rise to inl-perative mood ) . This document representation is successively transformed into a sequence of sentence plans  ( together with formatting instructions in a select a hletarget format  ; SGML , IgTEX , Zmacs and --- for screen output--slightly formatted ASCII are currently supported  )  , which are handed over to sentence generators . For English , we use ~ Penman ' and its sentence planning hm -guage  ( SPL ) as input terms , q ' ol ) roduce German and French text , we have implemented a German version of Pemnan's grammar  ( NIGEL )  , which is enhanced I ) yaro of phology module , and a fragment of a French grammar in the same way  .

2 The Knowledge Base
The Knowledge Base is encoded in I , OOM.
In addition to the standard KL-ONE functionality ( structured inheritance , separation of terminological nd assertional knowledge  )  , LOOMs upl ) or ts object-oriente . d and also rule-based programming . 
In addition totile ' Upper Model ' of the Penman generator  ( a basic ontology that reflects semantic distinctions made by language  , \[Bateman , 19901) more . than 1000 concepts and instances constitute the
TECHDOCKB . They encode the technical knowledge as well as the plan structures that serve as input to the generation process  . The domains currently modeled are end consumer activities in carma intenance and some technical procedures fl'om an aircraft maintenancel ~ilanual  . 
One of the central aims in the design philosophy of the TECtl DOC knowledget  ) as e is the separation of domain-independent technical knowledge and specific concepts  1  ) er-raining to the particular domain : the I ) orta-1 ) ility of general technical knowledge has been a concern\['rom the beginning  . For instance , knowledge about various types of tanks ( with or without imprinted scales , dip-sticks , drain bolts ) is encoded on an abstract level in tile inheritance network  ( the ' middlen lodel ' )  , and the particular tanks found in tile engine domain are attached at  , the lower end . Similarly , we have an abstract model of connections ( plugs , bolts , etc . ) , their properties , and the actions pertaining to them ( phlg-incormections can be merely connected or disconnected  , screw connections call be tightly or loosely connected  , or disconnected ) . Objects with the functionality of connections ( e . g . , spark phlgs ) appear at the bottom of the hierarchy . Thus , when the system is transt\~rred to a dill'e . rent technical domain-as experienced recently when we moved to air  ( : raft manuals --- , large parts of the abstract representation levels are reusable  . 
3 Document Representation Using RST
Tile first task undertakenill TECIIDOC was a thorough analysis of a corpus of pages from multilingual manuals in terms of e onte  . nt as well as structure of tile sections . A text representation lew ~ l was sought that captured the conuno  , mlities of the correponding sections of the ( lerman , English and French texts , i . e . l , hal , was not tailored towards one of the spe ( : ific languages ( for a discussiou of representation levels in multilingual generation  , see\[Grote et al ,  :1993\]) . Rhetorical Structure Theory ( RST ) turned out to 1 ) eansefid formalism : for a hnost every section we investigated  , the RST trees for the different language versions were identical  . 
Our work with RST gave rise to a number of new discourse relations that we found useful in analyzing our texts  . Also , we discovered several general problems with tile theory  , regarding the status of minimal units \[' or the analysis and the requirement that the time  ( instead of a general graph )  . These and other experiences with 1ST are reported in \[ E . gsner and Stede , 1992al . 
4 Recent Developments 4 . 1 Event s inmlat ion in the knowl - edge base We developed a detailled represe  . ntation f knowledge about actions . Together with an action concept , preconditions a , M post . -conditions can be defined in a declarative way . The preconditions can I ) echecked against the current state of the knowledge base  ( via BOOM's ASK queries )  . If the In'e-conditions hold , the action can I ) e performed and the postconditions are communicated to the knowledge base  ( with the TEl , l , facility of BOOM ) . This typically lead store classification of certain technical objects involved  . With the help of BOOM's production rule mechanisn had ditional actions either in the knowledge base or on all output medium  ( e . g . , for visualization ) can be triggered , lTn this mode , instru ( : tion generation is at by product of simulating the actions that the instructions pertain to  . 
Being able to take the current stat . e of a technical device into account , its in this simulation mode , is a prerequisite for uI > coming interactiw ' , applications of instruction generation : devices equil  ) ped with adequate sensory instruments produce raw data I  ; hat can 1) efed directly into tlwkuow le@:ebase . Thereby , the specific situation of the device , e . g . , the cltr , drives the instruction generation process , so that only the truly relevant information is given to the user  . 
4 . 2 Towards a document author ing too l A lirst version of an authoring tool has been designed and implemented and tested with a number of users  . The authoring tool allows to interactively build upknowledge base instances of maintenance plans  , including the actions and objects involved , and to convert them immediately into documents in these-letted languages  . At , anytime , the tool takes the current stal . e of tl le knowledge base into account : all n us offering select : on sdy  . -namically construct heir selection lists , s t ) that only ol ) tions of applie id ) le1 , yl ) es; , reoffered . 
4 . 3 F rom text generat ion to a mul-t imoda l in fo rmation system The generated t  . exts are now displayed with words , groups and phrases and whole sentences being mouse-sensitive and when selected-of l'ering menus with a pl  ) licatfle queries to be directed , othe underlying knowledge base instances . ' Phis allows for an mnl ) er of tasks to he performed on the generated sm face texts  , for ex ~ tmple : ? pronouns can \] ) easked almut their antecedent referenl , , lingnistic items in the output for one language can heasked about their cor-res l  ) onding il . ems in the of , her language solt tl ) llt ~ ol ) jeets can be asked about their location , answered by a suitable graphicil-lusl . ration , actions can I ) easked for more detailled instruction sou how to perform them  , answered by a short video seqtlence ,  .

The rhetorical structure represents logical relations between sentences or blocks of sentences of each section of the document  . A rhetorical structure analysis determines logical relations between sentences based on linguistic clues  , such . as connectives , anaphoric expressions , and idiomatic expressions ill the input text , and then recognizes an argumentative chunk of sentences  . 
Rhetorical structure extraction consists of six major subprocesses :  ( 1 ) Sentence analysis accomplishes morphological and syntactic analysis for each sentence  . 
(2 ) Rhetorical relation extraction detects rhetorical relations and construct stile sequence of sentence identifiers and relations  . 
(3 ) Segmentation detects rhetorical expressions between distant sentences which define rhetorical strncture  . They are added on totile sequence produced in step  2  , and form restrictions for generating structures in step  4  . For example , expressions like " .   .   . 3 reasons . First, . . . Second .   .   .   . Third , : .   . ", and " . .  . Of course .   .   .   . 
?  .   . But, .   .   . " are extracted and the structural constraint is added onto the sequence so ~ s to form a chunk between the expressions  . 
(4 ) Candidate generation generates all possible rhetorical strnctures described by binary trees which do not violate segmentatio  , , restrictions . 
(5 ) Preference judgement select stile structure candidate with the lowest penalty score  , awdue determined based onl ) reference rules on every two neighboring relations intileca  , ldidate . 
This proces select stile structure candklate with the lowest penalty score  , a value determi , wd based on preference rules on every two neighboring relations in the candkhtte  . A preference rule used in this process represents a heuristic local preference on consecutive rhetorical relations between sentences  . Couskler the sequence \[ P < EG > t~<SR>R\] , where P , Q , Rare arbitrary ( blocks of ) sentences . The premise of R is obvously not only t ~ but both Paud O  . 
Since the discussion in e and Q is considered to close locally  , structure \[\[ p < E ( ; > Q\]<SR>R\] is preferable to \[ P < EG >\[ Q < SR > R\]\]  . Penalty scores are imposed on thc structure candidates violating the preference rules  . For example , for the text in Fig .  1 , the structure candidates which contai , , tile substructure \[3 < EG > F\[4 < gx > 5\] < SR > 6\]\]   , which says sentence six is the entaihnent of sentence four and five only  , are penalized . The authors have investigated all pairs of rhetorical relations and derived those preference rules  . 
The system analyzes inter-paragraph structures after the analysis of iqtra-paragraph structures  . While the system uses the rhetorical relations of the first sentence of each paragraph for this analysis  , it executes the same steps as il , does for tile intra-paragraph analysis . 
5 ABSTRACTGENERATION
The system generates the abstract of each section of the document by examining its rhetorical structure  . 
'\[' hel ) rocess consists of the following 2 stages . 
(1) Sentence . evaluation ( 2 ) Structure reduction In the sentence valuation stage  , the system calculate the importance of each sentence in the original text based on the relative importance of rhetorical relations  . They are categorized into three types as shown in Table  2  . For tile relations categorized into ltightNueleus  , the right node is more important , from tile point of view of abstract generation , than tile left node . In the c~se of the Left Nucleus relations , the situatio q is vice versa . And both nodes of the Both-Nucleus relations are equivalent in their importance  . 
For example , since the right node of tile serial relation ( e . g . , yotte ( thus ) ) is the conclusion of the left node , the relation is categorized into Right N , cleus , and the right node is more iml ) or tanthantile left node . 
The Actual sentence vahlation is carried out in a den ~ erltmarking way  . In order to determine important text segments , the system imposes penalties on both nodes for each rhetorical relation according to its relative i  , nportance . The system imposes a peualty oil the left node fortile Right Nucleus rela-tlon  , and also oil the right node fortlle Left Nuclevs relation  . It adds penalties from tile root node to tile terminal nodes in turn  , to calculate the penalties of all nodes . 
Then , in the struelm'e~vduction stage , tim system recursiw ; lycuts out the nodes , from tile terminal nodes , which are imposed the highest peualty . The list of terminal nodes of tile final structure becomes an abstract for the original document  . Suppose that the abstract is longer than tile expected length  . In
