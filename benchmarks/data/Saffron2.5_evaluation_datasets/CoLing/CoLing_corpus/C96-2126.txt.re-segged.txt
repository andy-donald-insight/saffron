In this paper MULTITALE , a system for the semantic tagging of medical neurosurgical texts and for the semiautomatic expansion of the medical lexicon  , will be presented . Given the textual information explosion ( in particular in , though not restricted to , specialize domains ) there is an urgent need for tools enabling to exploit the information available in natural language texts  . MULTITALE has been devised therefore primarily with the aim to make explicit semantic information in medical texts  , which should lead to more refined information retrieval results  . By making " educated guesses " the system moreover has a possibility to expand its own lexicon of medical terms so to be able to cope with new texts  . 
I . INTRODUCTION
MULTITALE has been developed as part of an EU project  ( MLAP93-04 ) which has been started in 1994 and has been completed recently . The F , nglish part of it was carried out by the Belgian partner "  ( Office Line Engineering NV , Zonnegcm ; RAM 1T , Gent ) , the Dutch part by the Dutch partner ( Lexicology Research Group , Free University Amsterdam 1) . Although both groups share the same starting point and objectives  , the methods l bllowed show some idiosyncracies , thercibre if in what follows MUITI'ITALE is mentioned  , actually the MULTITAI , El ) ut ch module is meant . 
11. SEMANTICMODEL
The senmntic tagging is based on the CEN/TC251-model for Surgical Procedures ( CEN , 1994) . This model is a classification and coding system of medical procedures  . 
It distinguishes the following concept types : CC_Surgical Deed  ( indicating the surgical intervention )  , CC_Anatomy ( indicating an atomical concepts ) , CCP athology ( indicating pathological concepts ) , CC Interventional Equipment ( indicating the instrument )  , CCCombi ( a term which has a medical meaning only ira combination with another-medical-term  )  , rT . 1, ' rizzanin ( syntax ), A . Kramer ( lexicon ), 1 . Maks ( syntax and semantics ), W . Martin ( overall supervision ) CC modifier_body side , CC_modifier extent , CC_modifier_number ( terms which modit ~? other medical terms . 
The Surgical deed concept is classified into 12 subtypes , among others : CS_remove , CS close , CS_create , CS close , CS install , CS make appear . The Surgical decd concept is considered as the nncleus of the surgical procedure and may have differentypes of relationships with the other " medical concepts : the RDirect object indicates the object on which the surgical deed is carried out  ; the R_Indirect_Object indicates the object oor from or in which the surgical deed is carried out  ; the R_Location indicates the place where the Surgical 
Deed is carried out ; the R means indicates that with which the Surgical Deed is carried out  ; the Rnmnner indicates how the Surgical I ) ecd is carried out . 
The next example illustrates the CEN\TC 251-model.
The input is taken fl'om a report of a ncurosurgical intervention  ; the output is generated by the MULTITALI , ; system .

MUI/ITI'ALESYSTEM
OFTIlE
The MUI , TITAI , E system consists of 5 modules : 1 . -A syntactic tagger and lcmmatizer for l ) utch medical language . 
2 . -A syntactic module l br the lbrmation of minimal NPs and PPs  . ' l ' he syntactical module functions as a preprocessor  . As a consequence syntax is kept to a minimum and partial : only clause segmentation  , verb-detection and NI'/PI'demarcation is considered to be necessary  . 
3 . -A module for the attribution of concept ypcto the minimal NPs and PPs  . Given syntactical " chuncks " ( verbs , NPs , PPs ) within a certain space ( ehmse) , MUI/1TFALE tries to assigneol mepts to them . The system is preferential in that it has defined -based upon corpus observation and sublanguage modelling-a priority ranking/hierarchy of concepts when occurring in combination  , tol brmone complex concept . This priority ranking/hierarchy looks as follows :
CCSurgical ) eed
CC_l ' athology (2C_.lnterventional Equipment
CCA natonay
CC Colnbi
It governs the concept type calculus so that e . g . in an expression with a Surgical Deed , the latter over rules all other concepts as in rechler \] CC-Modifier-lk dyside\] retrom as loidale ICC-Anatomylincisie\[CC -Surgi catdeed\]  . So , too intire expression oste@taire\[CC-l'athlogy \] randen\[CC-Combi\]vande de kplaat\]CC -An attmy\]tile Pathology concept will over rule the other

Since the C\]: , N-model has much in common with Filhnore's Case Grammar  ( Filhnore ,  1968) , Case grammar-like fi'amesfi ) r the implementation of the model have been used . Case grammar gives an analysis of a sentence , centered around lhever b . CEN gives an a , mlysis of a surgical procedure , centered arotmd the Surgical deed concept ( which is often a verb )  . The definition o1" the cases of Case ( hammar is similar to the definition of CI?N Semantic I  , inks , both of them expressing relations between w , ' ious parts of the sentence . In Case grammar , selection restrictions arc specilied l brcases , in CI iN those parts of the sentence which are candidael bra Semantic lank  , refer to erie of tire CliNodel\]ned medical concepts  .

(The aneurysm is cut off with a straight clip ) Considering a sentence like example 3 , the system has to decide which noun phrase can be related to the verb and what is the nature of that relationship  . The possible Semantic Links correspond to the CEN Semantic Links  . 
So , in relation to the verb a felippen ( to cutoff ) we find-among others-DirectObject and Means . Like for Case Grammar , there are markers , like prepositions or the lack of prepositions , which point to a certain Semantic Link . 
In the above example , the preposition met ( with ) is an indicator for Means and it is the absence of a preposition which points to the Direct Object  . For identifying the Scmantic I , inks , three particular kinds of information are needed :   1  . the surgical deed concept and its possible Semantic 
Links 2 . the NP and its concept type 3 . the Prepositions and their values ( l values ) . 
Frames are chosen for the implementation f the model  . They have a toplevel which is fixed and represents things that are true of a certain situation  . They have a lower level with slots , conditions on the slots and fillers , which represent things that are expected for a certain situation  ( Minsky ,  1975) . As regards the top level , three different kinds of frames are defined for Multitale  . 
a . standard surgical deed frame:
LEXICAL ELEMENT surgical deed concept
PARTOFSPEECIt verb
CONCEPTTY PECC_surgical_decd
CONCEPTSUBTYPE subtype of CC_surgical_decd :

b . variant surgical deed frame:
LEXICAL ELEMENT surgical deed concept
PARTOFSPEECII noun
CONCEPTTY PECC-surgical-deed
CONCEPTSUBTYPE subtype of CCsurgical_deed:

c . non-surgical-deed frame:
LEXICAL ELEMENT non-surgical-deed concept
PARTOFSPEECH noun
CONCEPTTYPE non_surgical-deed concept type The lower level of the non-surgical-deed frame will be discussed below being different from the lower level of both the surgical-deed-frames  . The lower level of the surgical deed frames contains sets of slots for the identification of Semantic I  , inks . The set consists of a slot-called ROLE-for the type of Semantic Link  , a slot-called ARG-l br the pointer to the clement in the sentence which is linked to the surgical deed concept  , a slot-called CC-t br the conceptype ' of the element which is linked and finally a slot- called IND-for the indication  ( I-value ) of the function of the linked element . Each slot can specify conditions its filler must meet  . 





ROI , E conditions on the fillers are marked with *'* one of the CEN-defincd Semantic Links * CEN -defincd concept types * l-values 

CC1 ND

The conditions on the fillers are found in the surgical deed lexicon and the type lexicon  . The type lexicon gives general information for the surgical deed subtype  ; the surgical deed lexicon gives information for the individual token  , the individual surgical deed concept . 
IV . 2THELINKING MODULESTEPBYSTEP
For filling in the frame and analyzing the sentence  , the system performs the following steps for each Surgical-deed-clause  . 
( ex . 4a ) . . de catheter wordt in de wond geplaatst ( the catheter has been installed in the wound ) a . consultation f the surgical deed lexicon for finding the subtypentry of plaatsen in the surgical deed lexicon : < lemma > plaatsen<cat > verb < concept type > CC_surgical_deed < concept subtype > CS_inst all b  . consultation f the type lexicon for defining the frame The following frame will be built  ( conditons on the fillers of the slots are marked with *  ) :

Therefore , the condition on the < lND >- slot of th cR Direct_object  , will be changed to Ivan .

There is only one set of slots , expressing the link between two non-surgi-cal -deed concepts in a sentence :  ( ex .  5)  . . het intracellair gedeelte van de tumor wordt uitgecuret-teer d  . .
(the intracellar part of the turnout is cleaned ) The prepositional phrase van detumor modifies the noun phrase her intra-cellairge deelte  . The link between these two phrases is called postmodification link  . The slot POS ( ition ) in combination with the constraint +1 requires that the postmodifying phrase directly t bllows the NP fi  ) r which this frame is defined .

V . THEGUESSING MODULE
V .1 INTRODUCTION
The guessing module of the Multitale system deals with the semiautomatic augmentation of the concept lexicons  ( = lexicons of surgical deeds and non-sm'gical deeds  )  . The performance of the tagger depends Rn " a great deal on the completeness of the lexicon  . If the lexicon does not contain a medical term , the tagger cannot assign a semantic link to this unknown term and another one in the sentence  . The guessing module is an important help t br the attgmentation of the concept lexicon  , and consequently an important part of the Multitale system when tagging unknown texts  . 
The lunction of the module is twofold : 1 . -generation of a list of words which m'e likely to be medical terms and CEN concepts  . The list does not present just a list of words unknown to the system but a selection of words relevant to CEN  . 
2 . -suggestions regarding the concepty pet breach word of the generated list  . The suggested concept types arc CC~mthology , CC intervent equipment and CC_way . 
The module works semiautomatically : the list of unknown words is generated in an automatic way  , but the user of the system has to decide whether the suggestion is correct or not be for eadding it to the lexicon  . 
V .2 GUESSING NON-SURGICAL-DEED

The guessing module uses the frames of the linking module  . For the guessing of the non-surgical-deed concepts  , it uses the constraints given t br the fillers of the slots of the surgical deed frame  . The general rule is the following : if a phrase ( noun phrase or prepositional phrase ) has a Semantic Link with a surgical deed concept , at least one of the words of the phrase is a CEN -concept  . Suppose a sentence contains a surgical deed concept  , but the system is not able to make a semantic link between the surgical deed concept and another concept in the surgical-deed-clause  . In most cases , this is due to the fact that the conceptype of the terms is not known  , for example : ( ex .  8)  . . de tunor wordt verwo'derd . .
-detum or CC-?-verwijderd CCsurgical_deed CS remove  (  . . the turnout will be removed . . ) Suppose that tumor is not present in the lexicon , then the system is not able to meet the conditions of the slots of verw  ( /deren and cannot indicate the R_direct object . The l__w flue of detumor meets the required value for the slot < IND >  , but none of the concept classes required for the < CC > slot can be matched  .

IND*CC pathology/CC_combi/*CC_anatomy /* CC_ intervent equipment * l NONE The guessing module then ' relaxes ' the condition set and now considers the syntactic function of a noun phrase or a prepositional phrase  ( expressed by its I value ) as a sufficient indication for a semantic link . In other words : if the I value of an element in the surgical-deed-clause satifies one of the i + values rcquired for an<IND > slot  , then the element will be linked .

CC ?
IND iNONE
The next step is to make a guess about t be concept ype of the filled-in element  . The constraints-CC pathology , CC_coln bi and CC_anatomy ( see frame \] br verwij deren ) - of the < CC > slot , are considered as good candidates . To be able to make a choice for one of them , the constraints are connected with priority numbers  , obtained by corpus observation : ( ex . 8c ) part of the entry CS remove of the type lexicon : priority number : < conceptClass > CC_surgical_deed < concept Subclass > CS remove < rob RDIRECTOBJECT 
II < cc 1 > CC_pathology 1  <  cc2> CC anatomy 2  <  cc3> CC_ intervent_equipment 3  <  cc4> CC combi 2 < prepI>I_NONE < rol > . .
The numbers are based on the occurrences of combinations of concept types in the corpus  . These occurrences are translated into priority numbers for the constraints on the < CC> slots which are registered in the type and surgical deed lexicon ? The conceptype with the highest occurrence  ( in combination with the given surgical deed concept and the given Semantic Link  ) was marked with the highest priority number ( namely 1 )  . The concept type with the highest number is considered the most likely candidate for the filled-inclement  . So , the system will suggest the concepty peCC pathology l brtumor in  ( ex .  8) . In most cases the element , for which the conceptype is guessed , consists of more than one word : ( ex .  9 ) ? om de laterale tumorale expansiete kunnen verwij deren  . .
-delatcrale tumoral expansie
CC-?RDIRECTOBJECT-verwij deren CC_surgical_deed CS remove  (  . . to be able to remove the tumoral expansion ) The guessed conceptype is suggested for all the nouns and adjectives  , being the meaningful words in the phrase . 
Words which have a meaning in general language are marked < GEN >  , to indicate that the guess is morc questionable than in other cases  . 
results of the guessing module for ( ex . )  9: laterale CC_pathology?tmnor ale CC_pathology ? expansic CC_pathology ?  3"he suggestion is only correct for tumorale , whereas laterale is of the type MC body side and expansie of the CC combi  . In a later phase we intend to correct these cases of overgeneration  . 
V .3 GUESSING SURGICAL DEED CONCE PTS
The general rule for the guessing of sm'gical deeds is : each verb that has a Semantic Link with a CEN-concept  , is a deed concepts , Multitale makes use of the fi'ames as well . 
For each verb in the text that is not in the concept lexicon  , a frame is built . This li'ame is called CS neutral , its semantic on straints - the allowed concept ypes - and its syntactic on straints - the I values - are less strict than the constraints which have been specified for the frames of the surgical deeds belonging to a specifics nb typc  . Because of the ' neutral'character of tim fiamc  , no priority information can be given , so every constraint is labelled with the same degree  o1' prinrity ( =l )  . 
( ex .  10 ) entry of CS neutral in the type lexicon : < concept Class > CCs nrgic N deed < e one el ~t Subclass > CS_neutral < role > RI  ) IRECTOI ~ , IECT < ccl > CC pathology 1  <  cc2> CC_anatomy 1  <  cc3> CC intervent eqnipment 1  <  cc4> CC combi 1 < prep 1> I_NONE 1 < role > R 1NI  ) IRI~CTOBJECT < ceI > CC pathology 1  <  ec2> CC anatomy 1  <  ce4> CC combi 1 < prep 1> I_SOURCt ' ;   1  <  prep2> I_SITE 1 < role > RMEANS < ccl > CC anatomy 1  <  cc2> CC . intervent__cquipment 1 < prep 1> IMEANS 1 < role > RMANNER < ecl > CC surgical deed 1 < prepl > 1 MANNER 1 < end type > If the verb has at least one of the Semantic Links of the entry CS neutral  , it will be considered as a surgical deed concept :   ( ex .  11)  . . word ! de peritoneale drain intercutaan Eetunneld  . .
-periton cale drain\[CC intervent equipment
RI ) IRECTOBJECT?\]-gcttmneld\[CC surgical_ deed  , CS neutral ? I ( the drain is . . connected ) ( ex .  12)  . . wordt losgemaakt door wegboren . .

Vl . EVALUATION AND CONCLIISION
By way of conch , sion wc will mention the main results obtained until now  . MULTYI'AIA~has not yet been extensively tested , yet when confi'onted with new texts , results look quite satisfactorily and promising . The l bllowing table is based upon 5 new medical reports ( each some 200 word tokens in length )  , t be words not being a priori in the lexicon . 
syntax presentNps 56 correctly assigned 49 success rate 87% concepty pe assignment present medical concepts 121 corrcct ty assigned 114 success rate 94% concept linking links present 53 correctly assigned 45 success rate 85% Although these results should be confirmed by flm hcr tests and although the restricted character of the donm in  , no do nbt , has got all inllucn ce on the score , yet we hope to have shown that tim approach as such to semantic/concept t  , a lagging of medical reports seems both to bc promising and worthwhile of lilr ther exploration  .
