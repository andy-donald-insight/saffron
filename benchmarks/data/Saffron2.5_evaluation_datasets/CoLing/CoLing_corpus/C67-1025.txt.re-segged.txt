i.i.-Background
This work is a continuation of research reported in the paper Mathematical Models of S~non ~  , which was presented at the 1965 International Conference on Computational L inguistics  . That paper presented a historical summary of the concepts of synonymy and antonyms  . It was noted that since the first book on English syno-DS  , which appeared in the second half of the lath century  , dic-tionaries of synonyms and antonyms have varied according to the particular expli c it definitions of " synonym " and " antonym " that were used  . The roles of part-of-speech , context of a word , and substi-tutability in the same context were discussed  . 
Traditionally , synonymy has been regarded as a binary relat ion between two words  . Graphs of these binary relations were drawn for several sets of words based on Webster's Dict ionary of S~non~ms and matrices for these graphs were exhibited as an equivalent represen-t at ion  . These empirical results showed that the concepts of synonymy and entonymy required the use ofternary relations between two words in a specified sense rather than simply a binary relation between two words  . The synonymy relation was then defined impl icitly  , rather than explicitly , by three axiams stating the properties of being reflexive  , symmetri C , and t / ~ ansitive . The entonym ? relation was also defined by three axioms stating the properties of being i r reflexive  , symmetric , and ant it/~ansit ~ ve ( the last term was coined for that study )  . It was noted that the s~six axioms could be expressed in the calculus of relations and that this relation algebra could be used to produce short-er proofs of t ~ eorems  . However , no proofs were given . In addition , several gec~aet ~ ical and topological models of synonymy and antonymy '  . . J ~ were posed and examined .   , ~It was n Oted that certain of these models were of more theoretical than practical in terest  . Each model was seen to be simple in that it " could be expressed from mathematically elementary concepts  , end each stressed certain aspects of the l inguistic object being modeled at the expense of others  . However , there seemed to be little theoreti ~ al preference among them  . Their adequacy as models could be measured by the ir generality and predictive power  . In terms of these criteria the algebraic model  , whether expressed in terms of relations , graphs , or matrices , seamed to have the most usefulness . In part , this was due to the fact that one geametrical model  , although highly suggestive , did not include a precise specification of the origin  , axes , or coordinates for words in an n-dimensional space  . Similarly , one topo-logical model required a closure operation for each of the intensions or senses and had no linguistically interesting interpretation  . 
11.2 Summary
The present paper investigates more thoroughly the characterizations of synonymy and antonymy initiated in Edmundson  ( 1965 )  . In section 2 , synonymy and antonymy are defined jointly and implicitly by a set of axioms rather than separately as before  . First , it is noted that the original six axioms are insufficient ? to permit the proofs of certain theorems whose truth is strongly suggested by intuitive notions about synonyms and antonyms  . In addition , it is discovered that certain fundamental assumptions about synonymy and antonymy must be made explicit as axioms  . Some of these have to do with specifying the domain and range of the synonymy and antonymy relations  . This is related to questions about whether function words  , which linguistically belong to closed classes , should have synonyms and antonyms and whether content words  , which linguistically belong to open classes , must have synonyms and antonyms . Several fundamental theorems of this axiom system are stated and proved  . The informal interpretation of many of these theorems are intuitively satisfying  . For example , it is proved that any even power of the antonymy relation is the synonymy relation  , while any odd power is the antonymy relation . \ In section 3 , topological characterizations are posed and examined  . A neighborhood topology is introduced by defining the neighborhood of a word  . It is proved that this definition satisfies four neighborhood axioms  . Also , a closure topology is introduced by defining the closure of a set of words  . It is proved that this definition satisfies the four closure axioms  . 
2 . Algebraic Characterization 2 . 1 . Introduction-Relations Before investigating antonymy and synonymy  , we willests blish some notions and notations for the calculus of binary relations  . 
Consider a set V of arbitrary elmnen~s , which will be called the universal set . A binary relation on V is defined as a set R of ordered pairs < x  , p , where x , ysV . The proposition that x stands in relation R to y will be denoted by xR y  . The dcmain ~ Y(R ) , range ~( R ) , and field ~( F ) of relation R are , respectively , defined by the sets\[x : (~ y)(xRy)\] ; ( y : (~ Lx ) ( xRy) ; \[ x: ( ~y ) (xRy ) U ( y : ( ~x ) (xRy ) \] The complement , union , intersection , and converse relstions are defined by x~y = - . x  ~ ; x(RUS)y-x~vxSy ; x(RnS ) y " x ~ x ~ ; xR ' ly--yR x The identity relation I and null relation ~ are defined by xIy ~ x = y  ; ~y-(x~x ) , V ~( y  ~ y ) The product . and power relations are defined by xRIS y = ( . ~z)\[xRz^zSy\] ; Rn=-RIRn'ln ~ 1 Inclusion and equality of relations are defined by RCS=-xRy ==> xSy  ; R = SmRcSAScRLater we will use the following elementary theorems which are stated here without proof: 
Theorem : RgS ==> R " Ic_S " Im--
Theorem : RcS ~> ScR
Theorem : ( R'I ) " I = R
Theorem : ( RIS ) IT : RI(SIT)
Theorem : ( RIS ) " I = S'IIR " I
Theorem : IIR = RII = R
Theorem : s-r => RIs = RIT^SIR = TIR 2 . 2 Axioms and Definitions Under the assumption that synonymy and antonymy a reternary relations on the set C of all content words  , the following definitions will be used : xSiY = word x is a synonym of word y with respect to the intension i  ( or word x is synonymous in sense i to word y ) xAiY -= word x is an antonym of word y with respect to the intension i  ( or word x is antonymous in sense i to word y ) We will assume that the synonymy and antonymy relations are defined Jointly and implicitly by the following set of axioms rather than separately as in Edmundson  ( 1965 )  . 
Axiom 1 ( Reflexive ): ( Vx)\[xSix\]
Axium 2 ( Symmetric ): ( Vx ) ( Vy )\ [ xSi Y => xS ; Iy \] Axium 3 ( Transitive ) :  ( Vx ) (Vy ) (Vz ) \[xSiYAYSiZ :>
Axi~n4 ( Irreflexive ): ( Vx)\[x~ix\]
Axiun5 ( Symmetric ): ( Vx ) ( Vy )\ [ xAi Y => xA ; ly\]Axi~n6 ( Antitransitive ) :  ( Vx ) (Vy ) (Vz ) \[xAiYAYAiZAximm7 ( Right-identity ) :  ( Vx ) (Vy ) (Vz ) \[xAiYAYSiZAxiom8 ( Nonempty )  :  ( V y )   ( : ~ x ) \[xAiY\]xSiz\]~>xSi z\]~>xAiz\]The properties named in Axiams  6 and 7 were coined for this study . 
The above eight axioms may be as follows :
Axicm I(Reflexive):
Axiom2 ( Symmetric):
Axiom 3 ( Transitive):
Axicm 4 ( Ir reflexive):
Axiom5 ( Symmetric):
Axiem 6 ( Antitransitive):
Axiom 7 ( Right-identity):
Axiom 8 ( Nonempty ) : expressed in the calculus of relations

Ai ISic_Ai(Vy)\[A(y ) ~ ~\] where A(y ) = < x , y > : xE~(A ) though this is not necessary . The consistency of this set of aximms is shown by exhibiting a model for them  ; their independence will not be treated . 
In addition to the synonymy and antonymy relations it will be useful to introduce the following classes that are the images of these relations  . The synonym class of a word y is defined by si ( Y ) ' =\[ x : xSiY \] which may be extended to an arbitrary set E of words by si  ( E ) =- x: (  . ~y)\[y ~ ~ . ^ xSiY \]\] Similarly , the antonym class of a word y is defined by ai ( Y ) ---x : xA iy \] which may be extended to a set E of words by ai  ( E ) mx : ( ~ y ) \[ ye EAxAiY \]\] 2  ?  3 Theorems For ressons of notational simplicity , the subscript denoting the intensloni will be omitted in the sequel whenever possible  . However , the theorems must be understood as if the subscript were present  . 
As with any symmetric relation , it is possible to get stronger re-sults than Axi ~  2 and Axiom 5  . 
Theorem : S "1 = S
Proof : 1 ScS1 by Axiom 2 . Hence S"1 c_(S-1)-I = S . Therefore S"=S_by definitiQn of equali t y  . 
Theorem ~ A " I = A
Proof : Same as above theorem using Axi~n5.
Also we get a stringer result than the transitivity property of 
AxiQm3:
Theor.em : ~ S
Proof . ~ c_S by Axiom 3 . Hence S = SIIc_SIS = ~ by Axiom 1 . 
Therefore S 2 = S by definitio ~ of equality . 
In fact , by induction we have the generalization : Proof  , 8n = . 1s(sl~"2) . . .   . = sl(sl(sl "' Is ) '") = s . 
It can be shown that ant on ?~ and sync~n~a red is t in c t : A ~ S  . In fact we have the stronger result :
Theorem : A ~ -
Proof : Assume A ~7 . Hence AnS ~? or (~ x ) ( ~ M)\[x(A0S)y\] . 
Then x ~7^ x Sy implies xAy ^ y Sx icm 2 . SoxAx , which contradicts x ~ x by Axi ~ 4: I ~ ~ . Therefore Ac_~ . 
because of Axiom 8 , can we get a stronger result than the anti-t ransitivity p~oplFty of Axiom  6  . 
Theorem : A =  S

znusIc_A " IA . SoA ~ ~__ IIS = S . Therefore A "~= S since A2 ~ S by Axium 6 and SGA 2  . 
The right-identity property of Aximm 7 can be strengthened to:
Theorem : AIS - - A
Proof : AISuA by Axinm 7 . Now A = AIIUAIS since Iu S . 
Therefore AISA by definition of equality , As a corollary we get that S and Accexnute :
Corollary . AIS = SIA
Proof : AIS - - A = A " A = ( AIS ) " l = ( A ' lls'l ) " l -- SIA From the above two theorems it follows that : 
Theorem : SIA = A
Proof : S~A = AIS = A.
As a special case we ~ et :
Theorem : A3 = AIA = AIS = A.
In fact , we have the generalization :
Sifneven
Theorem : An = A if nodd
Proof : For neven , An = A2k = ( A2) k = ~= S . For nodd,
An = A2k+l = AI(A2) k=A tS = A.
Next , several theorems about synonym classes and antonym classes will he stated and proved  . First , the synonym class of a word is not empty :
Theorem : s(y ) ~ ?
Proof : NOW IcS by Axiom 1 . So(Vy)\[ySy\] . Hence ( . ~x)\[xSy\] . 
Therefore , s(y ) ~ ~.
Because S is a symmetric relation , we have:
Theorem : yes(x ) < ~> xes(y)
Proof:yes ( x ) <-----> ySx <-----> yS'ix <---> xSy <-----> xe s  ( y )  . 
Since S is reflexive , symmetric , and transitive , S is by definition an equivalence relat ion on the set C of all content words  . Hence , we have the important result :
Theorem : xSy <-----> s(x ) = s(y)
Proof : (------->) Assumex Sy . First letuGs(x ) . Then uS x ^ x S y - - - - - - > uS2y - - - - - - - > u Sy - - - - - - - > u ? s ( y )   . Hence s(x ) c_s(y) . Also s(y)c_s(x ) by a similar argument . Therefore s(x ) = s(y ) . 
( <==) Assumes(x ) = s(y) . Then ue S(X ) -~-> U?s(y) . SOu Sx-------u Sy . HencexSu ^ uSy ~-> xS ~ y ==> xSy . Therefore xSy . 
In fact , we have the stronger result : Theorem : s ( x ) Ns ( y )  =  . ~" s(x ) if xSy
L ? if-sy
Hence for a given intension i the equivalence relation Si partitions the set C of all content words into subsets that are disjoint  ( i . e . , the subsets have no word in common ) and exhaustive ( i . e . , every word is in some subset):
Theorem : C = ~) si(x)x ~
Second , the antonym class of a word is not empty :
Theorem : a(y ) ~
Proof:A~8:(vy )( ~ x ) tx~1 ~ p~es a(y)~~.
Note that a word does not belong to its antonym class : 
Theorem : y ~ a(y).
Proof : Assume yea(y ) so that yAy . But this contradicts Axiom 4: yIy ~ yXy . Therefore y ~ a(y ) . 
Next we will establish some relations between synoc~ym classes and anton ~ a classes  . 
Theorem : xA~~~(x ) = s(y)
Proof : (==>) Assumexea(y) . First letuea(x ) . 
~owuea ( x ) AxAy ~ uAx ^ xAy ~ uA2 y ~ u ~ ~ ~ - ~ u?s CY )  . Hence a Cx ) gs(y) . Also sCy)c_a(x ) by a similar argmnent . Therefore a(x ) = s(y ) . ( ~) Assume a(x ) = s(y) . 
But y?s(y ) = a(x ) . Hencey Ax . Therefore xAy by Axicm 5 . 
In fact , we get the following necessary and sufficient condition for equality : 
Theorem : a(x ) = a(y ) <== ~ s(x ) = s(y)
Proof : (~--~) Assume a Cx ) = a(y) . Nowa(x ) r la(y ) ~_~ z(~z)\[z ~^ ~ , v\]~-~(~z)\[xAz^zAy\]~xA-y~xSy . 
Therefore s(x ) = s(y ) by a previous theorem . (<~) Ass ~ es(x ) = s(y) . Then xSy . First , letu ? a(x) . Then uAx . Hence u AxAXS y ~ uAIS y ~ u ~ y == ~ U ? a(y) . Therefore a(x)ga(y ) . 
Also a(y ) ga(x ) by an identical argument . Therefore a(x ) = a(y) . 
2 . 4 Comments on the Algebraic Characterization Even thoughs  ( y ) #~ since ySy by Axin mi , it may be necesssry to add the following axiom :
Axiom 9: ( V y ) C~x ) Kx~y^x ~\] to guarantee that the domain of the relation S is not trivial  , i . e . , s ( y ) -Cy\]~?Axiom9 is not necessary if s ( y ) is permitted to be a unit set for certain words . Thus , we might defines ( y )  =  ( y ) for any function word y , e . g . , s(and ) = ( and ) . But this will not work for antonymy since a ( y ) might be considered empty for certain words such as function words  , e . g . , a(and ) = ~ . The alternative of defining a ( y ) = ~ is not reasonable since it produces more problems than it solves  . Axiom 8: ( V y ) (~x ) \[ xAy\]is reasonable if the contraries_of words  ( e . g . , nonuse , impossible , etc . ) are permitted , i . e . , ye ~( y) . 

The theorem s = S , A2 = S , AIS = A , SIA = A can he summarized in the following multiplication table for products of the relations S and A

MMMM 23.1. Introduction
We will now examine two topological models of synonymy  . Being topological , they concern " semantic spaces " of words without any notion of " semantic distance " between two words  . Again , we will restrict our attention to content words . Topological models for the antonymy relation will not be considered  . 
32. Neighborhood Topology
The first model considers a neighborhood topology , i . e . , a topology based on neighborhoods . A set is said to have a neighborhood topology if there exist elements x called ~ and sets Nx called neighborhoods of x Which satisfy the following axlcms : 
Axioml : ( Vx ) (~Nx ) \[XeNx\]~ian2: ( v ~ x )   ( vNx )  . c . ~N '' ~ x . \[~x~~xnNx\]Axiom3:(vy)CVS x ) CZs ~ , )\[y ~ s x ~> ~ y ~ ~1 Axiom ~: ( Vx ) (Vy ) (~x )   ( aNy ) Ix~y------>NxnNy--~\]These axioms can be pictured informally by the following Euler 
N x N ~ N x N x N y
Define a neighborhood n ~ ( x ) of a word x as any subset of the synonym class si ( x ) o~x that cSntalns x , i . e . ,
X eni(x ) ~ si(x)
Wain , for-reasons of notational simplicity , the subscript denoting the intension i will be emitted whenever possible  . 
First , neighborhood Axiom 1 is satisfied.
Theorem : ( Vx ) ( an(x ))\ [ xzn(x)\]
Proof : By definitions ( x ) is a neighborhood n ( x ) of x coaltaining x . 
Second , neighborhood Axiom 2 is satisfied.
Theorem : ( V n ( x ) ) ( Vn' ( x ) ) ( ~n" ( x ) )\[n" ( x ) cn ( x ) nn ' ( x ) \] Proof : For arbitary n~x ) and n ' ( x )  , let n "( x ) = n(x ) N n'(x ) . 
Then n " ( x ) ~ s ( x ) since n " ( x ) = n ( x ) nn ' ( x ) cs ( x ) Ns ( x ) - s ( x )  . 
Also , xen " ( x ) since x ? n ( x ) ^ xen ' ( x ) implyxen ( x ) nn ' ( x ) = n " ( x )  . Therefore , ( Vn(x )) ( Vn'(x )) (~ n "( x )) ~"( x)~n(X ) nn'(x)\] . 
Third , neighborhood Axiom 3 is satisfied.
Theorem : ( V y ) (Vn ( x ) ) ( ~n ( y ) ) \ [ y e n ( x ) ==> n ( y ) c_n ( x ) \] Proof : For arbitrary yen ( x )   , let n(y ) = n(x ) . But yen ( x ) impliess ( x ) = s ( y ) since yen ( x ) c_s ( x ) = z:zSx\]impliesySx and ySximpliess ( y ) = s ( x ) ? Then n ( y ) c_s ( y ) since n ( y ) = n ( x ) c_s ( x ) = s ( y )   . Also yen(y ) since yen(x ) = n(y) . Therefore , (vy)Cvn(x )) Czn(y ))\[ y~n(x)~n(y)~-nCx)\] . 
In fact , the neighborhood topology satisfies Axiom 4 , which is a separation axiom : The or T : ( Vx ) (Yy ) (~n ( x ) ) ( ~n ( y ) )\[x ~ y => n ( x ) nn ( y ) = ~\] Proof . Assume x ~ y . Let nCx ) = ( x and n(y ) = y . 
Then xen(x ) ~ s(x ) and yen(y ) ~ s(y) . Thus n(x ) nn(y ) = xn(y = ~ since x ~ y . 
Therefore , with respect to synonymy , words have a neighborhood topology since ( 1 )   ( Vx ) CZn ( x ) )\[x ? n ( x ) \]  ( V y ) (~n ( y ) )\[y e n ( x ) ~ n ( y ) ~ n ( x ) \]  . ( Vx ) (Vy ) (~n ( x ) ) ( ~n ( y ) )\[x ~ y ~ n ( x ) N n ( y )  = ~\] 3 . 3 . Closure Topology The second model considers a closure topology  , i . e . , a topology based on a closure operation . A set is said to have a closure topology if there exists a unary operation on its subsets  , denoted by ~ and called the closure , which satisfies the following axiums :
Axiom 2: Ec_E
Axiom 3: EcE~i ~ ~:.~' O-'f = ~' u ~"
Define the closure of a set E of words as the synonym class of E  , i . e . , The closure axiums can be shown to be satisfied by using the original definition of synonym class sCE  ) zx : ( ~ y ) \[ yeE ^ xsy\]However , shorter proofs are possible by noting that the synonym class of a set E of words can be expressed as s  ( E ) = yeEs ( y ) = E ( X : xS y
First , closure Axicm 1i ~ satisfied :
Theorem : s(g ) =
Proof : s (~) = sC y ) = ?
Second , closure Axium 2 is satisfied :
Theorem : E = - s(E ) o of . = .. U or y j
I = E since y?s(y)-~>
Third , closure Axi~n3 is satisfied :
Theorem : s\[s ( E ) \] cs ( E ) ~ oof:N~s ( s ( y )   ) = sCtu:u ~1 ) = tv:v~y\]~v : v~\]=s ( y ) since ~ c_S . Thussis(E)\]=Us(x)x~sCE)
UxU(.(x)-U.(,)ye Ey)y ~ Eye E
Fourth , closure Axiom ~ is satisfied :
The = am : sCEuF ) = sCE ) us CF ) ~ o of : sCEuF ) = ~ Js ( y ) y~-EUFs ( E ) US ( F )  . 
i a = l ~ J s C x ) : xeUs ( y ) ~E = sCE ) -- Us ( y ) us ( y ) = ye EyEF Therefore , with respect to synonyay , words have a closure topology since ( 1 ) s ( ? )  =

Note that fram Axioms 2 and 3 we get
Theorem : s\[sCE)\]=s CE ) 3 . ~ . Ca~nents on Topological Characterizations Note that for the neighborhood topology a separation sxicm has been added to the t~ree axioms proposed in Edmundson  C1~5  )   . Also , the neighborhood topology seems more intuiti vely satisfying than the closure to po logy  . However , for the closure topology if we define the derived set of a set E of words as the set of all words that ~ are synonymous to some word of E  , but not identical to that
Wordei . e..
then we have the followi ~ result :
Theorem : s ( E ) = EUg ' which may be given a reaso Qahle linguistic interpretation  . An example is y ' = s ( y ) -y which was discussed in the sectio ~ on algebraic characterization  . 
4. Conc`sions
These results support the belief that the algebraic characterization is insightful and appropriate  . For example , the assumption that synonymy is an equivalence relation also has been made  , either directly or indirectly , by F . Kiefer and S . Abraham (1965), U . We in reich (1966), and others . Since the axiom system defines the notions of synonymy and anton ~ Jointly and implicitly  , it avoids certain difficulties that are encountered when attempts are made to define these notions separately and explicitly  . 

These topological characterizations provide a no , metric represen-tation of what has been called informally a " semantic space "  . 
Previous attempts to construct a semantic space that is metric  ( i . e . , one for which a distance function is defined ) have not met with much success . The consideration of general topological spaces avoids this difficulty  .
