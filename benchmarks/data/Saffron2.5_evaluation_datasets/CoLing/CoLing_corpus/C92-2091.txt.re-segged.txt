A novel approach to Machine Translation ( MT ) , called Shake-and-Bake , is presented , which exploits recent advances iLL Computational Linguistics in terms of tile increased spread of lexicMistunification-based grammar theories  . It is argued that it overcomes some difficulties encountered by transfer and interfingual methods  . 
It offers a greater modularity of the monolingual components  , which can be written with independence of each other  , using purely monofing uM considerations . These are put into correspondence by means of a bilingua lexicon  . 
The Shake-and-Bake approach for MT consists of parsing the Source Language in any usual way  , then looking up the words in the bilinguM lexicon  , and finally generating from tile set of translations of these words  , but allowing the Target Language grammar to instantiate tile relative word ordering  , taking advantage of the fact that the parse produces lexical and phrasal signs which are highly constrained  ( specifically in the semantics )  . 
TILemain algorithm presented for generation is a variation on the wellknown CKY one used for parsing  . 
A to y bidirectional MT system was written to translate between Spanish and Enghsh  , and some of the entries are shown .

Thanks to Ann Copestake , Mark Ilepple , Antonio Sanfilippo , Arturo Trujillo , Pete Whitelock and the anonymous reviewers for their colnlltents  , Any error 8 relna Jnlayown . 
Linguistics , such a stile appearance of lexicalist unification -ba~sed grammar formalisms for the purposes of machine translation  , in an attempt to overcoine what are perceived to be some of tile major shortcomings of transfer and inter \] in gualat ~ proaches  . 
With a transfer-based MT system , the transfer component is very imcch language -pair specific  , and must be written bearing very closely in mind both monofingual components in order to ensure compatibifity  . Depending on how much work is clone by the analysis and generation components  , the tasks carried out by the transfer element may vary  , but iLL gener ' , d this module is very idiosyncratic and will involve several hundred transfer rules  . Writing these transferules is the most time -consmning aspect of the design of a transfer -based system  , as it nlust be consistent with hoth nlonolingual grammars  . The process is therefore error-prone , and the result is not very portable , since the consequences of making changes to the monolingual components may be far-reaching as far as the transferules are concerned  . 
One of them Mudifficulties with interlingual approaches is what Laudsbergen\[Landsbergen  87\] refers to as the subset problem . If the system is to be robust , it is essential to guarantee that any interlingual formula derived from ally Source Language  ( SL ) expression is amenable to generation into tile Target Language  ( TL )  . If the interlingua is powerful enough to represent all the meanings in all tile languages involved  , there will be several t probably i at l nitely many ) formulae in that interingua which are logically equivalent o the one produced by the analyser  . It canno then be guaranteed that this for nmla comes under the coverage or the TL generator  , unless we can draw logical inferences in the interfingua  . The complexity of this task may be eompntation Mly daunting  , since suh-problems of this ( such as satistiability and non-tautology ) are known to be Nl'-complete ( \[Garey and Johnson 1979\] )  . 
The approach presented here bears some similarity with that of \[ Alshawi et  al91\]  , which uses AcrEs DECOLING-92 , NAIVI ' ~ . 2328 Aovr 1992603 Paoc . ov COLING-92 . NAnt ES , AUG .  2328 ,   1992 the algorithm of \[ Shieber et al 90\] for generation from quasi-logical forms . On the other hand , generation here takes place from a set of TL lexical items  , with instantiated semantics , which makes the task easier . 
This approach was tested with independently -written grammars for small yet linguistically interesting fragments of Spanish and English  , which are used both for parsing and generation . These are put into correspondence by means of a bilingual lexicon containing the kind of information one might expect to find in an ordinary bilingual dictionary  . 
2 The grammar formalism
Aversion of Unification Categorial Grammar ( UCG )   ( \[ Calder et al88\] ) is used . Like many other current grammatical formalisms ( \ [ Shieber 86\] , \[Pollard and Sag87\] , \ [ Uszkoreit 86 D , it represents linguistic objects by sets of feature  ( or attribute ) -value pairs , called signs . The values of these signs may be atomic , variables or further sets feature-value pairs . They can therefore be represented as directed acyclic graphs or as attribute-value matrices using the PATR-II notation of \[ Shieber  86\]  . The notion of unification is then used to combine these  . 
The main features used in the signs are OR -THOGRAPHY  , CAT ( the categorial grammar syntax ) , OIt DER ( the directionality of the " slash " , which specifies linear ordering ) , FEATS(a set of syntactic features) , CASES ( a case-assignment mechanism built on top of standard UCG  )  , and SEM , a unification-based semantics with a neo -Davidsonian treatment of roles  ( \[ Parsons 80 , Dowty 89\]) . The semantics of an expression is of the form I : P  , where l is a variable for the semantic index of the whole expression  , and P is a conjunction of propositions in which that index appears  . In addition , features called ARGO , ARG \] and so on provide useful " handles " for allowing the bilingual lexicon to access the semantic indices  , but they are not strictly necessary for the grammars The signs presented are only shorthand abbreviations of the full ones used  , and the interested reader is referred to \[ Beaven  92\] for a more complete view . The PATR-II notation will be used , with the Prolog convention that names starting with uppercase stand for variables  . In addition , for the sake of clarity and brevity , the nonessential features will be omitted , as will be their names when these are are obvious . 
The grammar rules used subsume both functional application and composition  , but for the examples given here , only functional application will be necessary . 
An important feature of this approach is that this will make it possible to have an MT system in which no meaningful elements in the translation relation are introduced syncategorematically  ( in the form of transfer rules or operations with interlingual representations  )  . In particular , assuming we have very rich lexicai entries ( which contain information about various dimensions of the language  , such as orthography , syntax and semantics ) , all that is needed is a correspondence b-tween the lexieai entries  , supplied by a bilingual lexicon , together with a set of constraints for each correspondence  . 
The design of such a translation system will therefore involve three components : two monolingual lexicons for the languages concerned  , and a bilingual lexicon . The Spanish and English components were designed using purely monolingual considerations  , and as a consequences the treatments of English and Spanish grammars are quite different  . 
The basics of the grammar will be explained by presenting the monolingual lexical entries required for the Spanish sentence Maria  visit6 Madrid , which corresponds to the English Mary visited Madrid  . More linguistically interesting sentences will be offered at a later stage  . 
2.1 The Spanish Grammar
The Spanish grammar is somewhat an unconventional version of UCG  , in that VPs are treated as sentences ( S ) , and NPs as sentence modifiers ( S/S in the eategorial notation )  . The reasons for this decision have to do with accounting for subject prodrop  , and are discussed in \[ Whitehick 88\] and \[\[ leaven 92\]  . A ease-assignment mechanism is added to standard UCG  . Amongst other uses , it provides a coverage of clitic placement . 
NPs are sentence modifiers . The following one , for instance , looks for a sentence with semantics 11: Seml , and returns another sentence , in which the semantics have been modified to state that  F3   ( an index standing for Maria )  , plays a certain ( unspecified ) role in the semantics of 11 . The operation U stands for set union , and " all the propositions in the semantics are interpreted here as being conjoined  .

Since intransitive verbs axe sentences , a transitive verb must be a sentence looking for its object NP  ( now S/S )  , which make sure that this object gets identified with index Y  ( which fill stile patient AcrEs DECOLING-92 , NANTES , 2328 not ~ r1992604 Paoc , OFCOLING-92 , NANTES , AUG . 2328, 1992 role ) . This is carried out by the case-assignment mechanism  , not shown here . The following entry for tim transitive verb will be derived from the baseform and abstract tense morphemes  ( ee below )  .

The case-assignment mechanism , which identifies the indices of the NPs , can be used to interact with the ORDER feature if this is desired  . In tim above example , the only thing that prevents the assignment of agent role to Madrid and patient role to Maria are constraints on the semantic types of the arguments of the verb  .

R ? 0 F3 J2 . 3 S t ructure o f the b i l ingua l lex icon Tile bilingua lexicon merely puts into correspomdence pairs of monolingual lexie M entries  . In other words , each entry in the bilingual lexicon will contain a pair of pointers to monolingual emtries in each of the languages translated  . These monolingual entries are very rich signs , and the bilingual entries may add constraints for their monolingual signs to be in the translation relation  . For instance , if a word has more than one translation depending on how various semantic featnres become instantiated  , the bilinguM lexical entries may express these restrictions  . 
The bilingual exicon writer needs to be aware of what the monolingual lexicons look like  , in order to encode the restrictions that the bilingual sign imposes on the monollngual entries  . As long as some broad conventions are followed , this task becomes very straightforward . Most bilingual correspondences are very simple , and merely require some semantic indices in the monolingual signs to be unified  . Provided these indices are made easily available in predictable places of tile monolin-gum signs  , the task of writing the corresponding lexical entries is very simple  . When some semantic constraints need to be put on these indices  , again it is a straightforward task . It is only on the occasions when syntactic on straints have to be included that the monollnguM signs need to be examined more closely  , in order to determine how that syntactic information is encoded  . 
This results in a great modularity in the system . Any monolingual component may easily be changed , without affecting to any significant extent the bilingual lexicon  , and certainly not tile monollngual components for any other language  . 
At the same time , the simplicity of the bilingual component makes it practicable to write multilanguage systems  , since all the hard work goes into the monolingual lexicons which may be reused for many language pairs  , and the language-pair-specific information is concisely kept in the bilingua lexicon  . 
The following examples represent entries in the bilingua lexicon  . Such an entry consists of pointers to monolingual signs  ( for instance , (9) pnts signs (1) and (6) into correspondence ) , together with constraints about the semantic indices con-talned in these signs  . Thus example (9) identifies (9) (10)\ [ An G0E

SPANISII~\[;EM\[AnGOF3
Ill this very simple example , there was a one-to-one correspondence btween monolinguM entries  . More generally , tile hiling uM lexicon will encode correspondences between sets of nlono-lingual entries  , with appropriate constraints on them ( which allows us to enteridioms in the bilingual lexicon  )  . Most of the time these will be singletons , but they may occasiomflly contain several elements or indeed one of them may be empty  ( if a word in one language corresponds to the empty string in the other  , as will sometimes occur with function words ) . 
3 Shake-and-Bake
A new algorithm for generation , develop cd by Pete Whitelock and Mike Reape , and known as Shake-and-Bake is presented ( see\[Whitelock92\] for further discussion )  . It can be outlined as follows : first of all the SL expression is parsed using the SL  ( monolingual ) grammar . After the parse is complete the variables in the semantic indices are Skolemised  , and lexical entries are looked up in the bilingual lexicon and replaced with their TL equivalents  . Generation then takes place starting from the bag of TL lexical entries  , which have their semantic indices instantiated as a result of the parsing and lookup process  . 
Two wellknown parsing algorithms ( shift-reduce and CKY ) have been adapted to do this kind of ACTESDE COLING-92  , NANTEs , 2328 AO~"1992606 PROC . OFCOLING-92, NAtCrEs , AUG .  2328 . 1992 generation instead . Generation in tiffs context can be seen msa variation of parsing  , in which we lett m syntactic on straints instantiate the word order rather than letting the word order drive the parsing process  . 
The CKY parsing algorithm may be eharacterised a ~ follows : it uses a chart or table where all wellformed substrings  ( WFSs ) that are found are recorded , together with their position ( i . e . the words that they span in the string ) . The table is initialised with tilen words of the input string  . The algorithm builds parses by tinding the shorter WFSs before the longer ones  . For all integers j between 2 at t d n , it records all WFSs of length j by looking for two adjacent strings of length k and j-k recorded on the table  . If they may combine hymeans of a grammar rule , the result is recorded on the table . 
The algorithm may be modified for generating strings from a bag of lexical entries  . The table here no longer records the position of WFSs  , but just the WFSs with the set of entries from the bag that they are made from  . It is initialised by recording first all the wellformed strings of length  1   ( the lexieal entries )  . Then , for all integers j from 2 to n ( the cardinality of the bag )  , it looks for two disjoint WFSs of length k and j -k recorded in the table  . If they combine by means of an ( unordered ) grammar rule , the resulting string ( with orthography specified hy the direction of the combination  ) is recorded on the table , together with the set of entries it involves ( the union of the sets of the two components ) : Starting from the bag of TL signs above , this algorithm would first put the verb and object together into a component  , and then combine the result of that with the subject of the sentence  . 
Linear ordering is determined hytile TL grammar and the fact that the semantic indices a ~' e instantiated by the tinm generation takes place  . 
4 Morphology and Further examples
Finally we shall see how Shake-and-Bake handles more interesting examples  , in particular those involving argument switching and head switching  . 
Entries for verbs such as the ones shown above are derived from the baseforms and single morphemes  . \] ~ brinstance , visited is derived from morphemes for visit , 3sg and past . A similar thing is clone for Spanish , and the bilingual lexicon actually puts into correspondence the hase forms and the separate morphemes  . Correspondences between morphemes will be used from here on  . 
4.1 Argument switching
Argument switching , such as John likes Mary , which translates into Spanish as Mariagustaa Juan  ( literally Mary pleases John can be covered in a very simple manner  . The monolingual verbs closely resemble ( 2 ) and ( 7 )  . 
Their essential features are just : (12)

A harder example is when the head word in one language corresponds to a nonhead in the other  , such as Mary swam across the river , which translates as Mamacruz6elriona dando ( literally

This can be solved by putting into correspondence across with the stem cruz-as a possible translation pair  , together with the baseforms wim with na dando . Tile morphemes for 3 so and Acids DECOLING-92 , NANTES , 2328 Aour 1992607 PROC . OFCOL1NG-92, NANTES , AUG . 2328,1992 past are also put into correspondence .

The important aspects of these signs is that the bilingual element correctly identifies the indices of the lexical entries  , and the Shake-and-Bake generation takes care of the rest  . 
5 Conclusion
I hope to have shown how lexically-driven Machine Translation makes it possible to write modern  , unification-based monolingual grammars with great independence from each other  , and to put them into correspondence by means of a bilingua lexicon of a similar degree of complexity as one might expect of ind in a commonly available bilingual dictionary  , which could make it easier to automate its construction  . 
These points were demonstrated by constructing two monolingual Unification Categorial Grammars for small fragments of Spanish and English  , which nevertheless included some lingnistically interesting phenoinena  . They were written independently , and with purely monolingual considerations in mind  , which led to some noticeable differences in the grammar design  . The monolimgual components were put into correspondence by means of a bilingual lexicon  , and algorithms for parsing , doing bilingual lookup and generation were suggested  , which together constitute what has been named Shake-and-Bake Translation  . 
While the process of Shake and Bake generation itself is NP-complete  , it is likely that average case complexity may be reasonable  ( \[Brew92\] )  . In this sense , Shake and Bake may address issues raised by the L and s bergen's subset problem  , since inference in an interlingua may not even be decidable  .
