Inlerlingual MT hasty l ) ically come to inclt Ldea syntactic analysis of source language  ( SI , ) text followed hyits semm~tic interpretation ~ . uld representation i terms of a text meaning representation  ( TMR ) scheme , an interlin-gu , ' t . Recently two distinct views of the nattzre of lhe inlerlingua have become current-one based on a worhl model  ( e . g . , Nirenburg et al ,  1992 ) and another one based on the notion of lexieal conceptual structure  ( LCS )   ( e . g . , Dorr , 1992) . In this paper we analyze the role of LCS in the extraction of text memfing and argue that  , thotlg hit cannot be considered an interlingua when used by itself  , itet mtribtltes signilic+mtly 1o the Sl ) eciiication of an ac~teal interlingua . The task of ; el interlingual MT system bt filder is , then , to lindt tway to integrate the informalion provided in LCS into an ontology-molivaled text meaning representation serving as interlingua  . In this paper , we propose a model for Ibis integration mid illustrate the processes and static knowledge sources involved  , centrally including tile lexicon . 
In Section 2 wc propose a model of MT that involves both an LCS-based lexical semantics lruclure and a'FMR that is not b : tsed on LCS  . Because our lexicon lbrmal-ism does not represent LeSs  , but semantic role names that serve ~ us labels for LCS variables  , we will use I heabh reviation SDI+S ( for synlax-driven lexical semanlies , Nirenburggrad Levin , 1992) in reference 1o our system instead of LCS . We argue that TMR and SI ) LS are both necessary and that they are distinct . This model forms the basis of lexical-semanlic treatment of lexls in the multilingual MT l  ) roject Mikrokosmos . In Seclion 3 we present specific exmnples as analyzed in Mikrokosmos  . Wcillustrate the static knowledge sources ( primarily the lexicon ) and the representations that are l ) roduccd ( syntax , lexical semantics , and TMR ) . The Mikrokosmos model is based on a Iheory of form-to-meaning corrcsl  ) on dence which relies on the concept of a society of microlheories in le-grated in a no Li -Slratiticational manner  . We brielly sketch the main points of this theory in the \[ inal SeCliOn of this paper  ,  2 . The model Traditionally , int cr lingual MT systems which employ a full -Iflown syntactic module  ( e . g . , KBMT-g9 ( Goodman ? ~ tnd Nircifl)mg , 1992) or KANT ( Carl ~ onell et al ,  1992 ) ) use a single mapping between syntactic structure and in-lerlingua  . In Mikrokosmos , we propose a different model , as illustrated in Figure 1 . Lexical-cotlcel ~ lualSlrUCtures ( LCSs ) have been suggest edits meaning represenlalions for n  , ' ilural language sentences produced in accordance with the semantic theory developed by I lale and  Jaekend-o11"   ( e . g . , Jackendoff ,  1983 ) and used in MT-related exper-imenls by Dorr ( l ) or r ,  1993) . The inlerling tm text ( or texl meaning representation , TMR ) is a slruct t~re which represents meaning of texts in accor  ( la L ~ ce with I he ontology-oriented ;  . ipl ) roach to COml ) tllational seitlant it : s ( see N i , cn-burg and Lcvin ,  1992) .

Attempts have been made to use I+CSs as interlitlg ti as for M'I'  ( notably , Dorr ,  1993) . The impetus Ibr such work is provided by obserwttions that in mlmy cases LCSs for translation equivalents are  , in fact , identical . The many cases in which LCSs are not identical across lan+gtmI  , espose prol ) lems for this apprt ) ach . Methodologi-cally , therefore , tile type o1' work in LCg-itlterlingua projects is tinding ways of resolving e'ich cane  , based on observing crosslinguistic divergences in realizing meanings  . There is a danger I hat some of the divergences will prove unlreatable at the LCS level and  , alternatively , that solulions for some problems will neces -silale changes I  ( ) tile naltH'e of the L'epreseEIlalion which will make the resulting struclur cresemble tile original LCS in progressively smaller ways  . The problematic cases will be those in which translation equivalenl scansnch cases here  . 
The first problem arises in the context of a complex event  , such as a merger of two companies , which can lie described by mentioning , ' my of its llarts ( bids , tie-gotiations , etc . ) . This is particularly problematic when different langnages  , by convention or for ease of expression , refer to dill ' ereut parts of the complex event . In fact , snch divergences xist even within one language . For example , youc : mgoto al neeting ( directed motion ) , attend a meeting ( activity ) , or beat alneeting ( state ) . Similarly , while in English one takes a taxi , using ammsitive verb , the cor , esponding Japmlese for the stone event it takus i ninoru  ( get on , board , ride in a taxi ) , using an intrmlsi-tive verb with a gemargument . Even seemingly atomic events and states can be broken down into their : tspectual components to consist of events leading np to changes of slate that result in new slates  . For exgmlple , lhesilu-ation of knowing something can be expressed in English using the stative verb know or in Japanese using a non-stalive verbs iru  ( come to know ) in its rest lltative Ibznlsiteiru ( Lit : have coine to know )  . In examples nc has these , there will be no direct correspondence at the level of lexical semantics in individual lml guages  . 
The second circumstance in which translation eqniva-lents have different lexical selmmtics i that an element of metaling tllat is expressed as : mm'gnment-taking predical ei none l~mguage might not be expressed as an argument-taking predicate in ~ mother langnage  . Well-knowu examples from MT literature include like vs  . germ verlir de vs . just , etc . However , lhisphenomenon is much more widespread than normally acknowledged in the MT literature  . Things that are expressed as ln:dnor auxiliary verbs in English  , but are not verbs at all in Japanese in chldem~my high-frequency meaning element suclias phase  ( begin , continue , finish ) , modality ( mt4st l shot tld , plan , expect , try ) , midevidentiality ( seem , appeal ; look like ) . In fact , the syntactic means for encoding these types of megming vary wildly among lml guages  , going far beyond the wellknown verb-adverb divergences  . This is why ill the Mikrokosmosint crlinguawe represents nch elements of meaning as features or operators that scope over clauses mid propositions  . 
2 . 2 . Ilow is an lnterlingua Different from an SI ) LS

In the cases described above in which as it lgle event is described witl l different lexical sem ~ mtics the meaning shared by each member in the set of paraphrases makes a better c  , ' mdidale for the interling u ~ d semautic representation thml does the lexic ~ d semantics  ; and it is lhistype of meaning that we are striving to extract  , ' rod represent ill the interling natext in Mikrokosmos  . Additionally , while SDLS concentrales on the " who-did-what-to -whom " aspect of text meaning  , TMRscont ~ dn additional meaning facets , such as , ' tspect , modality , evidentiality , speech a cl , reference , etc . Finally , as TMRs ~ u'e not based on lhelexic : d semantics of one particular lmlguage  , there is no special benetito be accrued from the imposition of the requirement to preserve predicate-~u'gument stlctures  . 
2 . 3 . Universals of Semantic Role Assignment It is very enticing to be able to apply principles of lexical mapping theory cross-lingnistic : dly  . Similarities that have been observed across languages  inv01ve linkings of semantic rotes to syntactic positions or gramnialical fnnc-lions  , transitivity alternations , and verbel : roses . The latter have been described if + soln ? detail for English by B  . Levin (1?) 93) ~ md others . Thns , to ltte extent flu + l the hypothesis of cross linguistic equivalence holds  , the descriptioli of similar phenomena in other l +mguages  , for the pn rposes of M'I , becomes much simpler , it not ntterly trivial . 
l lowever , langnages , as : trn\[e , have different ransi-tivity altern'ltions ( Mitamura 1999 ) and even when they have a similar transitivity alternalion  , the classes of verbs to which they ; tp ply may be different . See Mahmoud 1999 for a discussion of the differences in the verbs I h : lt nn dergo the can sative-in choative altern : ttioniEnglish and Arabic  ) It is , of course , desirable to take advantage of universals , bill it is also necessary to have a syslem that is tlexible enongh to accommodate crosslinguistic 

7 . 4 . hliegl + allon of SI ) I+S into hilerlingilal MTTaking al ) osition on the necessity of both SDLS and TMR has to be based on a general approach  1o n n raveling the form-n leaning correspondence . For example , to make a TMR for John began to read we need to identify an nm-bcr of meaning elements  , prilnarily I hat something look place hefore the time of speech  , which was the beginning plut , ; e of are < iding even l carried on t by John .   2 I low do we lindtlles e pieces of information ? Tinle before the time of speecll is indicated by the  mos7Jfiolog j of " began " . 
The beginning phase is typically intlicn led h , xically by the verb begin in English . We know that it is the beginning phase of reading be canse the syntax module tells us thaitoreed is the complement of begin  . We know I hat John is reading because John is the snbject of begin  ( once again , the sytllaelic module produced this element of informa-lion  )  , whose lexical properties tell us thai John is also nnderstood as the subject of the complcment clause  . In oilier words , it is the predicate argnnienl structure of begin ( prodnced by the synlax-to-SDLS mapping procedure ill the lexicon entry for begin  ) I hattellsils where to lindulany of the relevant pieces of information  . 
l laving l hns served the purpose of identifying a part of the selnanlic dependency I obe represeuled in tilelinal TMR  ( just as the liudings of other syslenl modtnles played their assigned roles as clnes for deler mining paris of I he TMR strnctnre  )  , I he predicate : u ' gulnent slnctnre can then be disc:tided  . In Ihel % ~ llowing seclion we gives onic delailed exanlplcs of I henlappings involved in prodncing SDLSO Ull nll strnctures and TM l  , ts : ts well : is relevant paris of lexicon erllries  .

In doing so , we also describe a lexicon design which accommodates both Stl'nctures  . In all three exam-pies the SDL Sisjil Si one of the cities for dclcrt nining a CO lilpon cnl of nlealling  , and is not pre , served is 01 norphi-I\[l ~ cid cntally , therefore verb clilsses are nell suilable its sc -lnantio hierarchiesfi ~ rontology  ( Mitamura 1989 )  .   .   .   .   . it CO liNalso be the I ) eglllllll ll ~ pIse of ai I citer I'et ldlngi II -stesldjtlgl cite instance of reading--Ihei'e is no way litleler lnine which in the abSell Ce  ( if coillexl .

Tile examples also illustrate the use of constructions  ( Filhnore et al19 gg , Filhnore and Kay 1992 ) as annit of analysis alongside words , and show that treatment of MT divergences in this apl  ) roaeh simply falls out of tile general il to del . The languages used i or illustration are English , Russim L and Japanese . Since the system is symmelrical , we do not identify which is the source langtlage and which is the target langnage ill each exmnple  . 
Pot " each example , we list a TMR , which is thes ; une for all of tilelm guages , as well as synlaclics lruclures , semmltic role ~ ts signments ( SDLS ) , and lexicifl entries for each lmlguage . It should be appment hattile TMR is not necessarily isomorphic Io the SDLS of any of the languages  , and that sentences Irom different languages cml correspond to the same TMR even if their syntactic  , ' uldSDLS representations are not isomorphic . The Mikrokosmos TMR structure consists of clauses which roughly correspond to the " who did what to whont " component of meaning but also includes uch components as speech acts  , speaker altitudes , indices of the speech situ-alien , slylistic factors its well Its relalions ( e . g . , temporal titles ) allIOtlg amy el + the above , all do the relements . 
The lexical enlries include three zones --- syntax , semantic role , q s signment , and maPlting to TMR .   ( The lirsland third zones are discussed by Meyer et aI  . 199 t . ) The lirst zone specilies an LFG-style ( Bresnan 1982 ) syntactic subcategorizalion frame of a predicate , including which grammatical functions ( subject , object , CO mlllent cnt , etc . ) the predicate mtlst appear with and any requirement she predicate has of those funclions  ( case , syntactic alegory , specilic lexical items , etc . ) . The second zone , also in the spirit of LFG , specilies a mapping belweentile graln lnal-ical fair  , talons governed by it pfcdic . ' tt car Rl the sctl latltiC roles it ~ . ts signs . Semantic 1olo : kssignmenl is indicated by coindexing of a sy111actic slol and a semantic role slot . 
The semantic role munes used in lheexant ples are simply label slot argument positions in lexical conceptual slrtlc-Itlres  , which are not showtl here . The syntax iuld seln all liC role assign lnent Zot lesserve + the pllr\[  ) ose of Iocaling the imporlant participators in the sentence  . For example , they might ellust halthe experiencer : u ' gLnlt cnt is in the SLIbjCC l slot with dative case  , or I hat the phrase functioning as filelheme argument is loundill the object position  . They arc also imporlall lill caplt niltg bolh In rlgtiag c-specilic gncr-alizalions about verb classes and universals of SC lllttnlic role il Ss\ [ gnllle\[l\[  . For these leaSOl/S , the syntax and Sell lilll-tic role zones are entcial  , and therefore ii/tlSl beinch\]deal even in cases in which they differ drastically from the 

The third zone of tile lexical entry spccilies portion of TMR that is associated wilh a lexical item and how the compon cnls of the TMR corrcs ltond to the components of the syntactic alld Semanlic role zones  . We have chosen examples in which the TMR is not isomorphic to the synlactie and lexical senlantic zones  , ill t nost of the examples , a lexical item specilies I hattitle of its cmlt -plemenls heads I heassociated TMR  . Ill these cases , I he syntactic head of the sentence corresponds 1o some kind of scope-taking operator or a simple feature-vahm pair ill 

The examples , inci(lcnttdly , illustrate our treatment of MT divergences - -situations in which It source langlmg c sentence and its target l ml guage translation differ sig -nilicanlly in synlactic structure  , syntaclic category , or l ) ret ` licale-argun/ent slrttcltnc . No special mechanisms are needed to lreat MT divergence silloln IllO  ( JCL Alllhatis needed in order to translate a sentence involving a divergence are source and target language lexical enlries of tiles or t il hlstrated here I hatmall dil\]erent synlaCliC strtlcttneselitelhe S\[llllOTMR  .

Another in lport an Ifealuxe of ottr model is that it considers constructions to be basic lexical unil sah  ) ng with words . Following Filhnore el al . , 19gg , we deline constructions as ( possibly , discontiguous ) ynlaclic structure or produclive synlaclic pattern whose meaning it is often impossible to derive solely based on the meanlings of its components  .
