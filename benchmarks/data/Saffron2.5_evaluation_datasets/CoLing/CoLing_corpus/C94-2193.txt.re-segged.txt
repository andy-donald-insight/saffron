Abstract
We discuss a treatment of VP-ellipsis resolution in DRT in general  , and particularly cases where the source clause of the elliptical VP contains presupposition triggers  . We propose to restrain VP-elfips is resolution by presupposition neutrali-zation  . We view presupposition as a kind of anaphora , with the ability to accommodate an antecedent if not provided by discourse  . 
1 Introduction
In this paper we discuss the treatment of VP -ellipsis resolution in general  , and particularly its interaction with presupposition  . We share the opi = nion of those who argue that ellipsis resolution should take place at a semantic level \ [ Dalrymple et al  , 1991; Kehler , 1993; Sere ,  1993\] . We will provide a framework in which ellipsis resolution is constrained by presupposition projection  , and furthermore , anaphor and presupposition are represented underspecified in the semantics  . 
The latter postulation is necessary for a proper treatment of VP-ellipsis on the semantic level  . 
The source clause of an elliptical VP often contains presupposition triggers  , and resolution of the elided VP asks for presupposition projection in the context of the target elliptical clause  . This is an issue which has been neglected in the literature hither to  . 
The other thesis we put forward in this paper is that VP-ellipsis resolution is constrained by presupposition  . Every elided VP is evidently escorted by some presupposition trigger  . The cases we will pursue through this paper is the presupposition * This work was partly funded by the German Ministry for Research and Technology  ( BMFT ) under contract 01

introduced by focusing particle such as too.
Of our interest are examples like: ( 1 ) John kicked his dog , and Tom did , too . 
(2) With Betty , John visited her parents , and with MARY , he did , too . 
Example ( 1 ) presupposes that only John owns a dog ( in the strict reading )  , or presupposes that both John and Tomown a dog ( in the sloppy reading )  . Example ( 2 ) shows that this strict/sloppy ambiguity also occurs in cases where there is a nonsubject parallelism  . 
We use the level of discourse representation for VP-ellipsis resolution  , in an extension of Discourse Representation Theory \[ Kamp  ,  1981\] . For the reconstruction of elided material we adopt a version of Asher's Concept Abstraction mechanism\[As-her  ,  1993\] . 
We furthermore integrate Vander S and t's presupposition projection algorithm  \[1992\]  . Vander S and t argues that presuppositions are kind of anaphoric expressions which interpretation is strongly influenced by discourse structure  . The main difference to pronouns is that presuppositions have more descriptive content  , which enables them to accommodate an antecedent , in case not provided by discourse . 
2 DRT-framework
In this section I will outline a proper framework that integrates anaphora resolution  , presupposition projection , and ellipsis resolution . Basically , we will extend Kamp's Discourse Representation Theory slightly  , by integrating the treatment of presupposition of Vander Sandt and reference to combination of these three formalisms into one  , leading to interesting results concerning the analysis of VP-ellipsis  . 
\] ) RT focuses on the semantic interpretation of discourses  . A major aspect of I ) RT is the use of Discourse Representation Structures that hold these-inantic content of sentences as a pair < U  , C > , in which U is a set of discourse markers ( referents ) and C a set of conditions upon them . The full syntax of DRSs is given in Definition 1 . 
Definition 1: DRS Syntax 1 . If U is a set of reference markers , Caset of conditions , then the pair < Uq ~ , C ?> is a 1) RSI ~; 2 . If Pisn-place predicate constant and tl .   .   . 
t  ~ are terms , then P ( tl .   .   . tn ) is a condition ; 3 . If ( i ) and g ~ are DRSs , then ~( P , ? => qJ and ( I)V ? are conditions 4 . If ( I ) is aI ) RS , P a predicative I ) R S , tl , t2 are terms , then ~( h , t2) : ( I ) , cP ( h ) and h : O are conditions . 
Clause (2) forms atomic conditions . Clause (3) states negation , universal quantification , and disjunction . Clause (4) defines anaphoric , elliptical material , and propositions and deserves more attention because it deviates from Kamp's original proposal  . In our framework we introduce the alfa-condition ( ~:~ ) which functions to indicate that the information in \]  ) \] IS ~ must be anaphorically Linked to previously establishe discourse markers  . 
It has two additional arguments , one for indica-ting the prhlcipal referent of the anaphoric construction  , and ( optional ) one for stating the antecedent . So a condition c ~( x , y ) : ~ states that y is the antecedent for x ~ under restriction of  ( I )  . 
In the case of pronouns ,   e0 only contains discourse markers and no conditions  . But in the case of , for example , definite descriptions ,   ( I ) carries the restrictions in its conditions for linking the discourse marker associated to the definite description to an earlier introduced marker  . 
Referential constructions such as ellipsis and event-type anaphora  , are not linked to discourse markers but , instead , refer to portions of discourse , and are indicated bye : P ( t ) , where P is an abstracted piece of the previous DRS  . Resolution of epsilon-conditions is done by applying the abstracted DRSP to its argument  . 
Alfa-and epsilon conditions do not c~rry any subordination relations with respect to other DRSs  , and neither do propositional conditions . They are , in contras to the sub-DRSs formulated under clause  ( 3 )  , accessible for anaphoric relations and inherit the subordination relations of the I  ) RS in which they are situated . 
Ellipsis resolution is done by a process called C -Abstraction  ( cf . Asher 1993, p .  249) . It is stated in a simplified form as: Definition  2: C-Abstraction for VP : ellipsis ( Asher )  1 . If c : P ( t ) is a condition in DRSK and is derived from auxiliary do  , then P may be iden-tiffed with Ay . K * , where K * is an alphabetic variant of a part of K . 
2 . K * is underspecified for alfa-and epsilon -conditions  . 
While parsing a sequence of sentences , we aS-sume tile following : firstly , we have got ~ proper I ) RS of the sentences that we have parsed so far , and secondly , a compositional bottom-up construction procedure that returns the DRS of the actual sentence  , which is called the sentence-l ) RS ( henceforths-I ) RS )  . 
An s-DRS is in a sense underspecified , because all anaphoric material that it includes is still unresol-  . 
ved . On the representation M level this is marked by leaving the option M slot in the Mfu-condition for the antecedent untilled  . Anaphoric material contains , besides the ' normal ' anaphors , also all presuppositioual information of the sentence under consideration  . Accordingly all presupposition inducers are marked as such in the lexicon  . 
3 Presupposition Projection
In this section we will show how presupposition projection  ( aild hence , anaphora resolution ) is treated in I ) R T . The Mgorithm I present is in essence conform to Vander Sandt's proposal \[ Vander S and t  ,  1992\] . Vander S and t's theory is principally based on two mechanisms : binding supposition theories  , the former corresponds by and large to presupposition cancellation  ( or better : neutralization )  , while the latter is sort of repairing the discourse in the style of Lewis  \[1979\]  . 
The idea of V ander S and t's work is that " anaphoric expressions are either linked to some previously established antecedent or  , if they have enough descriptive content , accommodated at some level of representation "\[ Vander Sandt  ,  1992\] . All anaphoric information is resolved ( undernormal circumstances )  , conform the following rules : 1 . Try to bind the anaphoric material to an accessible antecedent  . 
2. If (1) fails , accommodate an antecedent.
Accommodation must take place at some accessible level of discourse  . It has been argued in the literature that accommodation must take place as global as possible  . \[ Helm , 1983; Vander Sandt , 1992\] . Rather than using a non-monotone moving operation for accommodation we obey the following algorithm  :   1  . 


4. Ready.
If there is a superordinated level then ( 2 ) else ( 4 )  . 
Copy the presupposed information to this level , but only if this does not lead to semantic contradictions  ( unbound variables or in consi-stencies ) or pragmatic violations , else (4) . 
Repeat step (1).
We will not elaborate in detail on the issue which constrains constitute the elimination of possible accommodation sites  . The interested reader should consult Vander S and t's paper  ( 1992 ) for proposals . 
We exemplify the projection algorithm with ( 3 ) and ( 4 )  . The former presupposes John as a ( to gowner , the latter , in contrast , does not presuppose that , although it contains the same presupposition inducer  . This is named the the projection problem . 
(3) John beats his dog.
(4) If John has a dog , he beats his dog.
The result of the compositional semantic on struc -tion process for  ( 4 )  , given that presuppositions are marked in the lexicon as anaphorical  , is the following s-DRS :
X2o/x ) ljohXlxl,\] dog(x2) of(x ~, x ~): e e . ( x ~) : ~ dog(x4) ~( x , ): of ( x , ,xs ) beat(xa , x4 ) This s-DRS is merged with the DRS of the previous discourse  , which is in this case an empty one . The next step is to examine the newly acqui-red conditions and see if there are any anaphoric 
DRSs among them.
In the first place we find the condition for the pro-pername John  , which is treated as a presupposition . We cannot bind this expression to a referent , since there is none available , so we accommodate the information in the principle DRS  ) Accommodation is simply fulfilled by copying an alphabetic variant of the anaphoric DRS to the main DRS  . 
Linking is possible for the personal pronoun x3 to the ( closest ) referent of John . 
The other anaphoric DRS in the conseqnent of tile implication paraplirases his dog has an embedded anaphoric DRS  , which has to be resolved first . In this case the referent x5 can be linked to xl . Finally we can resolve x4 to x2 because their corresponding conditions do not conflict and yield: 
X 6 john ( x6 ) - - - X1 ~ ( Xl  ~ X6 ) := ~ dog ( x2 ) IIot ( x~ , xl ) / < xJ , xl ): V_c~tx4'x ~)' I of (?4 , xs ) beat(xs , x4 ) This DRS is fully specified and paraphrases the meaning of  ( 4 ) correctly : There is a male person called John , and if John owns a dog , he beats it . 
For (3) , our algorithm would accommodate the information that John owns a dog  . 
X Note that proper names , treated as presuppositions , arc always accommodated to the top level DRS this way  , or linked to previously established markers . 
1186 4 VP-ellipsis Resolution by
Presupposition Projection
We will explain our analysis of VP-ellipsis by example  ( 5 )  . R . ecM1 that ( 5 ) is ambiguous in whe-ther ' Ibrn is beating John's dog  ( the strict interpretation ) or Tom is beating T on Ps dog ( the sloppy reading )  . 
(5) John kicked Ms log . ' Ibm did , too.
Our analysis heavily relies on the interpretation of focusing particles  . No existing approach to VP-ellips is does so , M though absence of presupposition introducers makes interpretation of elided VPs impossible  ( 6 )  . The set of presupposition triggers I am referriug to includes particles like too  , also , so , either , discourse connectives before ; after , and , but and other presupposition inducers such as certain focusing constructions  . 
(6) ? John kicked his dog . Tom did.
We will emiha size on the interpretation of focll -sing particles  , especially , the adverb too . Discourse particles function to enhance the cohere  . nee of discourse . They do not add anything to the meaning of the propositius they modify  , but rat-her judge whether at propositions tits within the previous : on text or not  ;  . This feature characterizes them as eliminators of possible readings in a given context  . It makes it impossible to understand ( 5 ) as 3 ohn kicked Bill's dog , and '/ binkicked 51 bra's dog , for example . 
The particle too typically is sensitive to fi ) cused objects . It , words , to o(qS ) , ? a proposit k , n , presupposes '~/) , with gJ a proposition derived froln ? with the focused items in ? replaced by their alternatives  . We follow Rooth\[Rooth , 1985\] in taking the fm , c tion of focus to be evoking alternative sets . Focus determines in that respect an additional semzmtic wflue H  1  . Ordinary semantic values ~ . \] o are not affected by focus . 
(7 ) \[ q bmf a kicked his1 dog\]j = the set of propositions of the for ln " x kicked x's dog "  ( 8 ) ~' Ibm / , 1 kicked his2 dog ~/= the set of pro-positions of the form " x kicked his ~ dog "  ( 9 ) \[! l'om/ ,   1 kicked his1 dog ~? = the proposition " John1 kicked his1 dog " Note that pronouns with focused antecedents  ( 7 ) get a referential interpretation , and pronouns with an unfocused antecedent get a bound interpretation  . The semantics of too , stated in terms of Rooth's alternative semantics is consequently :  ( lO ) too ( I ) :\[ iq ? ( DI7 ~ ~ ( k ~- I ~\]\]' ) The merge operation ( D takes two DRSs and returns a new one . The merging of I ) RSs consists in simply taking the union of the sets of discourse markers and the sets of conditions separately  . 
The alfa-condition in ( 10 ) introduces the presupposition of too . In order to preserve : oordinafion be . tweeuthis presupposition and the asser Lion , it is necessary 1 ; oper form ellipsis and anaphora re-solutiou befire the interpretation of proposition modilying particles  (  ; an take place . 
We will work out an example in detail to make clear how resolution is restrained by presupposition  . l ) is course markers of type x , are used to range over individuals , markers of type Pl range over propositions . Consider (5) , paraphrased in the following DRS : (11) . plp2 x1
Pl : john(x1) kicked(x1, x2)
ByC-Atstr ; ~ ction(Def .  2 ) we derive the following predicative I ) RS for kicked his dog ' , wt , ich will be ~ p plied to the argument of tile epsilon-condition in  ( 11 )  , x4 . 
( t2) Ay.
X 5., do ~( x ~) I~x ~) '
I " ~' of(x~,x0)/kicked(yxs)lations . It will become part of a context distinct from its original one  , and therefore other discourse markers may play the role of antecedents  . The discourse marker x 6 , standing for his , can be either linked to the marker corresponding to Tom  , or to the marker corresponding to John . In the former case we get a referential reading in the presupposition because the antecedent is in focus position  , in the latter case we get a bound reading . However , these possible readings 2 are checked for being allowed by the presupposition it roduced by too  . 
Applying ( 10 ) to the resolved propositional DRS P2 with the referential reading gives us the presupposition in  ( 13 ) which allows the sloppy interpretation of Tom does  , too : (13) p2:
X4 tom(x4) dog(x~)X~~(x~,x~): of(x~,x0)

X9X7 jolm(x9)
CIp3 , pl ) :- dog(xT ) v ~ : of(x ~ , x ~) ~( ~ , ~) :\[ ~\] kicked(x9 , xT ) The presupposition P a can be linked to P lin ( 11 ) and is therefore not rejected . The resolved DRS with the bound reading in the presupposition gi-vesus the strict interpretation of the elided VP  . 
The presupposition stemming from too for this case is  ( 14 ) and can also be linked to Pl . 
(14) a:(p3, pl ): p3jo ?, :< :;)/ aog(x ~)
P3:/of(x~,xs)\[.kicked(x~,xT)
Given DRS (11) , no other presuppositions can be satisfied and therefore these two readings are exhaustive  . Because linking of presuppositions has 2Which number would be larger , if there were more suitable antecedents for x6 , more possible antecedents VPs , or more alternatives for the focused object Tom . t lowev cr , none of these readings would fulfil the requirement to be an anaphoric presupposition ! in our framework a higher priority than accommodation  , readings like '/ bmkicked x's donkey , where x does not equal John or Tom , are not allowed . 
Finally , note that , for the definite description his dog , in the second case presupposition neutraliza-tion by anaphoric binding took place  , while in the first case the presupposition was accommodated  ( by " assertion " )  . 
5 Comparison to other Approa-ches
I classify previous approaches to VP-ellipsis resolution as  1  ) approaches that take the antecedent VP as ambiguous  ,  2 ) approaches that pursue a copying-and-renaming mechanism  , and 3 ) approaches that rely on discourse relations . None of the approaches to be mentioned use presupposition as means to restrain VP-ellipsis resolution  . 
Source-clause Ambiguity Approaches The first class of approaches to VP-ellipsis is characterized by claiming that the semantics of the elided VP is identical to another VP salient in discourse  . They treat the source clause as ambiguous in cases where there is both a strict and sloppy interpretation possible  . For illustration , our example ( 5 ) would allow only one of the two possible properties for the antecedent VP  , respectively the referential and the bound interpretation  . 
(15) a ) Ax . kicked(x , dog_of(x )) b ) Ax . kicked(x , dog_of ( john ) ) Resolution is simply done by choosing one of the possible sources given in  ( 15 ) and apply it to the subject of the elliptical VP . This analysis is proposed in \[ Sag ,  1976\] , \[ Williams ,  1977\] , \[Klein ,  1987\] , \[ Roberts , 1987\] and \[ Gawron and Peters ,   1990\] and are also termed " identity-of-relations " approaches in the literature  . 
The most serious problem that these approaches face is " the postulation of wild ambiguity in the source clause  , one derivation for each possible case of subsequent ellipsis  . "\[Dalrympletal . , 1991\] . 
Furthermore , it turns out to be impossible to hold ( 16 ) With Betty , John visited her parents , and with MARY , he did , too . 
Example ( 16 ) also shows the strict/sloppy ambiguity . Our analysis predicts this , since the focused object is Mary , and the presupposition stemming from too is either with x  , John did visit x ' spa-rents ( sloppy reading ) or with x , John did visit
Betty's parents ( strict reading).
Copying-and-Renaming Approaches
On the other hand , there are the ' sloppy-identity ' , qmn-identity ' , or ~ flexible-copying ' approaches to the problem of ellipsis  , which aband on the assumption that the source clause is ambiguous  . 
Instances of these analyses are the higher order unification and equation Manalysis\[DM rymplet al  . , 1991\] , role-based copying methods \ [ Kehler ,  1993\] , and few posited in Discourse Representation Theory \[ B ~ uerle  , 1988\];\[Sem ,  1993\] ; and Kainp ( Personal communication fKamp to Gaw-ron & Peters \[Gawron and Peters  ,  1990\]) . 
Their shortcomings are , generally stated , first that they are forced to put additional , intricate cons-traints on resolution to omit overgeneration frea-dings  . Second , these approaches do not include a detection of parMlelism  . They take the identification of parallel objects for granted  , or assume that the subjects of the source and target clauses are parallel  ( which is not necessarily the case , see e . g .  (16)) . A proper treatment of ellipsis requires the integration of parallelism detection between the source and target clause  . 
Our approach can also be classified as a copying -and-renaming approach  , with the difference that it uses presupposition eutralization as an a-turn constraint rather than using " artificial " constraints to restrict resolution  . Copying-and-renaming analyses generally have better predictions than source-clause-ambiguity approaches  . 
The following example , for instance , is judged to have five readings : ( 17 ) John revised his paper before the teacher did , and Bill did , too . 
Our analysis generates ( assuming that before introduces a similar presupposition as too  )  , when the embedded elided VP is strictly interpreted  , two readings ( the corresponding presuppositions are x revised x 's paper before trevised t's paper  , and x revised j's paper before the trevised t's paper  ) and three readings when the embedded elided VP is sloppily interpreted  ( here the corresponding presuppositions are : x revised x's paper before trevised x's paper  , x revised j's paper before trevised j's paper , and x revised x's paper before trevised j's paper  )  . These are exactly the same readings as \[ l ) alrylnpl et al . , 1991\] , \[Kehler , 1993\] and \[ Sem , 1993\] get in their analysis . 
Analyses using Discourse Relations
A quite distinct class of approaches to VP -ellipsis are those that use discourse structure to restrain resolution lasher  , 1993; Gardent , 1993; Priist and Scha ,  1990\] . These merely built on fi'ameworks stemming from AI of whom the most famous one is Grosz & Sidner 's Discourse Structure Theory \[ Grosz and Sidner  ,  1986\] . In order to identify the underlying segments of discourse and their relati-ons that hold between them  , interpretation of clue words ( finguistic expressions that indicate boundaries between discourse segments  ) and the purpose of the speaker is taken into account  . Also , one inight need knowledge of the world in the analysis of segmentation  . 
A general problem that these approaches face is that they heavily rely on discourse relations  . 
The redefinition is " notoriously elusive "\[ Gardent  ,  1993\] , and an exhaustive classification is still subject to future research  . Although cue phrases play an important role ill signalling topic changes in discourse  , in general another mechanismight be needed to find connections which are not clearly stated  . The use of speaker's intentions might be necessary but in general there is no finite set of possible intentions available \[ Grosz and Sidner  ,  1986\] . Another problem is the difficulty of finding a general way to incorporate world knowledge in a working system  . 
It is unclear in how far one needs discourse information for ellipsis resolution  . An interesting future research topic is how far presupposition  , as proposed in this paper , can support this task . 
Take for example : (18) If John be a this donkey , Bill will too , but if he doesn't , Billwon't either . 

Although source-clause-ambiguity approaches predict the right two readings for  ( 18 )  , it is unclear how copying ~ and-renaming aalyses would eliminate any mixed strict/sloppy readings wit-hout using discourse relations like contrast and parallelism  . 
6 Conclusion
We proposed to perform VP-elllps is resolution on a semantic representation level  , in a DRT-style framework . We did so by incorporating a Vander Sandtian approach to presupposition projection  . 
This gave us means to treat interactions of VP -ellipsis with presupposition  , in such a way that we do not need any intrinsic rules that traditio-nal copying strategies use for VP-ellipsis resolution  . In this respect , emphasis was laid upon the presupposition i troduced by the particle too  , although the analysis of other discourse particles is not expected to be much different  .
