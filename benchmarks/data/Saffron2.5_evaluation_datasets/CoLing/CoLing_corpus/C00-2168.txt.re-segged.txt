Resource acquisition for NI . Psystems is a well.
known bottleneck in language engineering . It would be a clear advantage to have a methodology that could provide an mch cheaper way of NI  , I " resources acquisition . The methodology should be universal in the sense that it could be applied to any language and require no skilled labour of lm  ) fossionals . Our approach attempts just that . 
We describe it on the example of the syntax module of the Bo as knowledge elicitation system tbra quick ramptip of a standard transfer-based machine tran <  ; laliori system from any langnage into English ( Nirenburg 1998 )  .

"\[hc problerns with the current fully automatic corpus-based approaches include difficulties of maintaining any system based on them  , due to the opaqueness of the method and the data to the language ngineer  . At the present time , the most promising NLP systems include elements of both corpus-based and human knowledge-based methods  . One example is acquisition of Twisted Pair Grannnar  ( Jones and ttavrilla 1998 ) for a pair of English and a source language ( SL )  . 
Another example of a mixture of corpus-based and human knowledge-based methods is a system to generate a I  , exicalized Tree-Adjoining Gramn-iar(F .

7 Al : quisitim ~ of Syntax in Boas 2 . 1Miethodolo ~ ies for Selection of Syntax

In general , tile issue of the selection of parameters tbr grmn maracquisition is one of the main problems tbr which there is riosing leans wer  . Parameters applicable to more than one language are studied m the field of language universals as well as lheprinciples-and-parameters ap\[  ) roach ( Chomsky 1981 ) arid its successors ( ( Tholnsky 1995 )  . Widely devised as the ba:ds of universal granlmar  , the principles - . 
and -- parameters approach has Ibcused on the uiliversaliiy of coitail lI  ( )rn-ial grammatical i-riles within thai particular approach rather on i hosub~tarl live and exhaustive lisl of universal parameters  . , a subset of which is applicable to each natural hm  , < . ~ uage . , along with lhcii ? l l l l corresponding sets of values  , such as a parameter set of nominal cases . In some other approaches , parameters and parameter values are either not sought out or are expected to be obtained automatically  ( e < , Brown et al 1990; Goldstein 1998) , and , while holding promise for the tiittire as a potential component of an elicitation system  , cannot , at this time , lbnn the basis of an entire system of this kind . 
lit order to ensure uniformity and systematicity of operation of a language knowledge licitation system  , such as Boas , it is desirable to cometip with a comprehensive list of all possible parameters in natural lalguages and  , for each such parameter , to create a cumulative list of its possible values in all the languages that Boas can expect as SLs  . Three basic methodological approaches are used in Boas  . 
Expectation-driven methodology : covering the material by collecting crosslinguistic information on lexical and grammatical parameters  , including their possible values and realizations , and asking the user to choose what holds in SL ; while it is beyond the means of the current pr qiect to check all extant languages fbr possible new parameters ~ we have included infomlation from  25 languages . 
Goal-driven methodology : in the spirit of the " demand-side " approach to NLP  ( Nirenburg 1996 ) Boas was tailored l brelicitation of Mr relevant parameters rather than any syntactic parameters that can be postulated  . A parameter was considered to be relevant if it was necessary t br the parser and the generator used in MT in the Expedition project  ( http:/tcrl , NMSU . Edu/expeditior l /) . 
The parser used is a heuristic clause chunker developed at NM SUCP  , \[ , which replaces the complex system of phrase structure rules in a traditional  '2 erammar and uses language specific information , among then tword order ( SVO vs . 
SOV ), clause element(sul!ject,o\[!iect , etc . ) marking , agreement marking , nouil phrase structure pattern , position of a head . 
l ) at a-driven methodology : prtml piillg the user by English words and phrases and requesting translatior is or oth crrcnder in  , ,s in SI . ; datadriven acquisition is the first choice , where verl ' easible , because it is the easies type of work l br the users t  ; In Boas , datadriven acquisition is guided by the resident English knowledge sources  . 
2.2 Types of Syntax Parameters in Boas
The parameters which are elicited through the syntax module of Boas include  2 what we call diagnostic and restricting parameters  . 
Diagnostic parameters are those whose values help determine clause structure l brcorrect structural transfer and translation of clause constituents  . For example , in languages which use grammatical case , the subject is usually marked by the nominative , ergative or absolutive case ; direct objects are usually marked by the accusative case  , etc . \] he list of the currently used diagnostic parameters in Boas includes : bask sentence structure parameters : word order preferences  , grammatical fimctions ( subject marking direct object marking , indirectol : tiect marking , complement marking , adverbial rnarking , verb marking ) , clause element agreement marking , clause boundary marking , and bask noun phrase structure parameters : POS patterns with headmarking  , phrase boundary marking , noun phrase component agreement Restricting parameters determine the scope of usage of diagnostic parameters  . Some of the diagnostic paralneter values can only occur simultaneously with certain restricting parameter vatues  . For exain ple , in languages with the ergative construction the case of grammatical subject is restricted by the tense and aspect of the main verb  ( Mel'chuk 1998 )  .

The inventory of tags and represeritation format  . The tags for NPs include head and parameter values : The parameter  ( feature ) set consists of Part of speech , Case , Number , Gender , Animacy arid I ) e finiteness ( the values of the latter two may pose restrictions on agreement of NP components  )  . Every NP is represented in tile Bo as knowledge base in the fbmier a typed feature structure as illustrated by the following example  ( the sign "#" in arks the head ) :\[" agood  #boy "-:\[ struct . ure:nouz_ , --phrase\]\["a "-\[ pos:determiner , number : sizlgular , root : : " a"\]\]\[" good "=\[ pos:adjective , root:"good"\]\]\[" boy"-\[pos:noun , case : nominative 4 , number : singu\]_ar , animacy : anilnate , root : " boy " , head:l\]\]\]Two kinds of tags are used for sentence taggirtg tags that t-efi : r to the whole seutence and tags for clause elen ~ ents  . Sentences are assigned yah . los of such restricting parameters a ;   3We in chl de hl the prerequisite knowledge as much overtly listed linguistic information as possiMe  , to avoid the necessity of atmmmtic morphological analysis and generation which caililot guar '_iilte cabso--\[utcly correct results  .

(Ganse elements are tagged with the vahie of the diagnostic paraineter "' syntactic functiot f ' and wllues of tile restricting parameters " chtuse element realizatiol <"" animacy " and " definiteness "  . Clause elements also inherits on tellce lags . Senloncos are tagged in Boas as shown by the following exatnple  ( the 17 . ) im of representation is ; l typed feature structure ) :\[" the boy give < ~ a book to his teacher ": :\[ structure : sentence  , form : affirmative , elause-type:main , voice : active tense : present , aspect : indefinite \]\ [" the boy "= i funct ion : subject  , realization : noun-phrase , animacy : animate , definiteness : definite , head-root : " boy"\]\]\[" gives "=\ [ function : verb  , realization : verb , head-root:"give"\]\]\["a book "=\[ funct ion : direct-object  , realization : noun phrase , animacy : inanimate , definiteness : indefinite , head-root:"boo\]<"\]\]\["t:o his teacher "-\[ function : indirect-object  , realization : prepositional-phrase , animacy : animate , definiteness : definite , head-root : " teacher "\]\]\] Following tile expectation-driven methodology tile sets  ( if pretagged noun phrases and sentences are sclected to cover many though  , admittedly , not all expected cotn binations of parameter wihles for every phrase or sentence  . The fbllowing two examples fiirther illustrate the 
Boaselicitation procedure.
Noun phrase patterneiieitation . The user i ~ given a short dei inition of a noun phrase and asked to translate a given English phraso ~ for example " aXood t ~ r  ) l ''" into S . using tile words given in a small lexicon of selccled SI  , lexical items translated Ii'omt'nglisil . In case of the Russian hmguage tile resuh would be : a good boy looks tipe very input SL wo Min the lexicon and assigns part of speech and feature vahie tags to all the components of SL noun phrases  . English translations of SL words help record the comparative order of noun phrase pattern constituents in SL and English and automatically assigns the headmarker to that element of the SL noun phrase which is the mmslation of the English head  . This is the final result of SL noun phrase patternelicitation t bra given English phrase  . It includes a SL noun phrase pattern to be used in an MT parser and a pattern transfer inlbn nation for an English generator  . Possible ambiguities , i . e . , multiple sets of feature values for one word is resolved actively  .   1he module can also actively check correctness of noun phrase translations  . 
Clause structure elicitation includes order of the words  , subject markers ( diagnostic feature values or particles )  , direct object markers , verb markers , and clause element agreement . Just like in the case of noun phrases , the user is asked to translate a given English phrase into SL using the words given in the lexicon  . For the English sentence used in the example above the Russian translation will be : the boy gives a book to his teacher ---> malchikda et kniguuchitel ju As soon as this is done  , Boas presents the user with English phrases corresponding to clause elements of the translated sentence  , so that for every English-SL pair of sentences the user types in  ( or drags from the sentence translation ) corresponding SL phrases , thus aligning clause elements . After the ractive alignment is done , the system automatically : ? transfers the clause elementags fiom 
English to SL5.
* nmrks the heads of every SI , chm seelernent , and o assigns feature values to the heads of clause elements  .

assigns sentence restricting parameter values ( clause type , voice , tense and aspect , the last three are ligature values of the verb ) . 
In the case of assignment of multiple sets of feature values the user is asked to disambiguate  . 
them . As a result , every SL clause element is now tagged with certain values of diagnostic and restricting tags  . The system stores these results as mternal knowledge represenmtion  , i the f i , mn of a feature structure , for further processing . For example , t br the above English-Russian sentence pair the mediate results  ( not shown to the user ) will be :\[" malchikdae tkniguuchitel ju " :\[ s tructure : sentence  , form : affirmative , clause-type:main , voice : active , tense : present , aspect:imperfective\]\["malchik '=\[ function : subject  , realization : noun--phrase , animacy : animate , head-l , root : ' malchik ' , case : nominative , number : singular , gender : masculir ~ e , person:third\]\]\["dae ~'=\[ function:verb , realization : verb , head-root : " davat '" , number : singular , person:third\]\]\["kniqu"-\[function:direct -object  , realization : noun-phrase , animacy : inanimate , head-root : ' kniga ' , case : accusative , number : singular , gender : feminine , person:third\]\]\["uchitelju "=\[ function : indirect-object  , realization : noun phrase , animacy : animate , head-root : " uchitel '" , case : dative , number : singular , gender : masculine , person : third\]\]\]This data is fiu-ther automatically processed to obtain tile kind of knowledge which can betised in tile parser or generator  , that is , rules ( not seen by the user ) , where the tl , ,"~ht-hand side centares a diagnostic parameter value  ( wordo Mer , clause element marking , agreement marking , etc . ) and restricting parameters which condition the use of the COi Tesponding diagnostic parameter valtte  . A sample rule for the Russian example above is as l bllows: 
DirectObject Markerl = SL . Ru\] . e\[!hs:SentenceForm\[affirmative\]




Subject\[realization:noun-phrase animacy : animate\]

phrase animacy : inanimate \] , rhs:<:SLDirectObjectMarker\[case:accusative\]: >\]  ; These results are presented to the user for approval in a readable form ? In Russian these rifles mean the tbllowing : in the a  . / . /b + matives ntence , mai / 7 clalts e , active voice , presentense , when the xuO/ect is realized as NP midanimate and direct c:/?/ecti:+"r'caliT  . ; ed as NI " and itum imcite , + word order is SV () ; ? subject is innominative case ; * direct object is in accusative case ; subject agrees with verb in number and person . 
After all the sentence translations are processed in this way  , the rules with the same right hand side are automatically combined  . At the next stage of processing the set of values t brevery restricting parameter in the righthand side of the combined rule is checked on completeness  . This means that in Rttssian in the affinnative main clause the prelbrred word order is SVO  . The final result : ; are presented l + or the ttserl bral->t-wo valor editing  .
