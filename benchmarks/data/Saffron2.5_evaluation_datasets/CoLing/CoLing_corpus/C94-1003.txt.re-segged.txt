Abstract
Distinguishing exceptional translation examples is an important issue in example-based transflw systems  , because such systems use exceptional and general translation examples unifi  ) rmly . This l ); qmr , lescribes a mechanism for dealing with exc , q ) tiom d translation examples in our example-hosed tnLnsfer system  , Sim ~ lban , and proposes a method for identifying such examples in a translation exampl ~ base  .

( " car " )  . If this is the case , the English output ohtained by using ( el ) is ( tl )  , ' -' where as it should he 0 , 2 ) : In recent years ~ the example-based approach ha . s been used in many areas of natural language l ) mcessing\[3 ,  7 ,  8 ,  10~ 9 ,  1\] . We haw ~ been tlsing this al ) -proach to develop a transfer system called 5'imTra  ' ,  \[13 ,  14 ,  16\] . However , a bottleneck occured in the collection of large numbers of translathm examples consisting of pairs of parsed structures in the source and target languages  ( hereafter we ( : all these structures translation patterns ) ~ because parsing is not a perfi~et process . We now have some methods for overcoming this problem  . For instance , recent studies\[2 ,  11 ,  6 ,   12\] have proposed mechanisms for collecting pairs of parsed structures automatically from translation examples  , and in the previous paper \[15\] , 1 pro-posed , ~ method for extracting relevant translation patterns by comparing a wrong translation rest tlL and its correct ranslation  . Using these methods , we ca . n now collect translation patterns reh ~ tively easily  . 
There is , however , another problem ca . llede ~ : ample inte , ?e , ~ nce , wl , ich means that an , xceptional ( or idiomatie ) translation pattern is selected when a general translation pattern should be selected  ; this hast~side-effect on the construction of a target structure  .

This probh ~ nl occurs because xamph ' ~- ba , sed transfer systems choose example simply on the basis of similarity  . This ca . n be considered by using the analogy of cells like those shown in Figure  1  . In the \[ igure , a dot represents a translation e ? aml ) le ~ and a cell represents a spac ( ! in which an input is determined to be similar . According to this analogy , all example-blused system chex:ks the cell in which an input is located  , ; ~ nd uses an ex ~ mplegow ~ rning the cell . If a new exa . mt)le is added in this space , it cell for it is created as if cell division . If an input happens to fall into the cell of an exceptional example  , it is wrongly tr~mslated . The r,d ' or e ~ an exce . ptitmal examples houkl be added as ~ spechd cell ( a shaded dot in Figure 1 ) that h ~ us no exte , t in the example-based space , so that it . cannot he used unless it matches the input exactly  . Thus , an examl~le-based transfer system must deal with , ~ xctq ) tiom d translation patterns t : parately when calcuhtting similarity  . 
This paper describes a mechanism used in Sim~l Fan for dealing with exceptional translation patterns in the same framework as general translation patterns  , and proposes a method for identifying exceptional tn rnsh ~ tion patterns in ~ tr ~ ul sla  . tion pattern base .

" ear " ( tp2) Figure 2: l' ; xeeption M translation l ) attern and general i , rans\[ ; tLion patternSimTlNn calculates the similarity between a subgraph of an input structure and the source part of a translation pattern on the basis of both the structural similarity and the similarity of the lexical-forms of corresponding nodes  . For instance , the distance ( the inverse of similarity ) between two Japanese lexical-forms is expressed by the difference of their values in a Japanese thesaurus called Bunrui-Goi-l I you  \[5\]   3 as follows:
I@h code(w , )- bgheode(~ , ,~)\[ + distance(wl , w2 ) = bghmax + b " where bgh code ( w ) is the codev Mue in the Bunrui-Goi-Hyou , bghma : c is the maximal difference of the bgh codes  , and 6 is a penalty value incurred when wl and w2 are not identical . This equation is used for lexical-forms in general translation patterns  . If one is a lexicM-form which requires exact -match in an exceptional translation pattern  , then the distance is calculated as follows : 0 wl is identical to w 2 distance ( wl , w2 )   1 othevwlse a Bunrui-Goi-II you is a Japanese thesaurus consisting of large trees for nominals  , adjectives , and verbs . Each node is assigned a uniquen mnber . Similar concept words are locat txlin similar positions  ( or assigned similar numbers ) in these trees . 
A lexical-forni has a distinctive fea . tnre that makes it possible to determine which equation should be used hicMculating similarity I if one of two le  . xlcal-forms i expressed by a single-quoted string , then the distance between the lexical-forms is calculated by using the second equation  ; on the other hand , if both lexical-forms are expressed by double -quoted strings  , then their distance is calc : nlated by using the first equation  . 
Thus , an exceptional translation pattern is distinguished by having nodes whose lexicM-for rns are single-quoted strings in its source part  , while a general translation pattern is distinguished by having nodes whose lexicM-fi~rms are all double-quoted strings in its source part  . Not MI nodes in the source part of an exceptional translation pattern are necessarily single-quoted strings  ; single-quoted string nodes and donbh+-quoted string nodes may be mixecl in a translation pattern  , ht Figure 2 , ( tpl ) is an exception altr ; ulslation pattern and ( tp2 ) is a general translation pattern . Notett ~ t t the root node of the Japanese part is the only single-quoted string in  ( tpl )  , and it matches only an input whose root node is ' ky-ou yo LIs Hru  . ~ By using this distinction of lexical-for rns , we e~n integrate exceptionality handling into the similarity calculation framework without separating this task as a preprocessor postprocess  .

Fronit he viewpoint of the transfer process , what we would like to identi\[y are translation patterns that may have side-effects when they are selected instead of general translation patterns  . We call such translation patterns exceptional travs Iation pattern  . s . According to this definltlon , exceptional translation patterns are not restricted to idiomatic patterns  , in fact , more transla-tlonl ) atterns other than idiomatic ones fall into this category  . Here : we classify exceptional translation patterns into the following two categories : t Extra-Exceptional Translation l ' atterns : These have some  . extra elements hit he . target part in addition to those in similar traim httimi patterns  .

The . algorithm for identi\[y hlge ? cept lonal trluislation patterns is as follows:  , I \] ?

Step 1 Divide translation patterns into sew ~ ralgroups , each of which consists of equlw dentranslation patterns  . 
Step 2 For each pair of distinct translation pattern group sgl and g ~  , if any pattern of 9t is equivalent to any pattern of g2 other than nodes governed by the root of the sourcel  ) art , tlmn the translation patterns in glar id 92 are marked gen-er ' ~ L Step 3 ~ breach pair of distinct translation pattern group sgx and  g2  , if " the source part of any pattern ( pl ) of gl is equivalent to the source part of any pattern of  g2  , but target parts of them are not struetn rally identical  , because Plha . sextra elements ~ then the translation patterns of gl are marked extm-exeeption a LStep  4 For each non-exceptional translation pattern group gl  , if there is another general translation pattern group g ~ such that any pattern  ( Pl ) of glise quiv Mento any pattern of g2 other than the root node in the target part of Pt  , then the translation patterns of gt are marked itt h'a-exceptional  . 
Step 2 identifies possible general translation patterns if they are used in a relatively wide range of ' words  , because in general an exceptional pattern is restricted in the usage of words  . This approach , however , is not perfect rotident if , ying general translation patterns , be can set here in ~ tc~use such that the exccp -tionality derives from a single special word  . Therefore , in the next step , checking does riot exclude these possible general translation patterns  . Step 3 identities extra-exceptional translation patterns by checking the structure of the target part  . Step 4 then identifies intra-exception alones by comparing the mot node in the target part with the root nodes in the target part of possible general translation patterns  . The reason why this comparison is restricted to possible general translation patterns is that intra-except i  ( n , d translation patterns have si ( h~efrects only when they are similar to general translation patterns  . 
Figure 3 shows an example of the identifl cation of exceptional translation patterns  , in which the Japanese verbs " kyou you suru " and " tsukau " haw  . ' the same bgh code , and the Japanese nouns " kuruma , "" denwa ~" and " mahou " have different bgh codes  , on the other hand , " kuruma " and " jitensyd ' have the same bg , eode . First , step 1 dividest Imse translation patterns into four groups : group  1 c . on sists of ( tpl ) , group 2 consists of ( tp2) and ( tp3) , group 3 consists of ( tp 4) , and group 4 consists of ( tp5) . Step 2 identifies group 2 and 3 as general translation patterns , because " kuruma " and " denwa " have different bgh codes  . Subsequently , step 3 identifies ( tpl ) as an extra-exceptional translation pattern , beci~use ( tpl ) has extra elements " the use of " for ( tp  ~ )  . Further , step 4 identifies ( tpS ) as at , iutra-exceptional translation pattern , because ( tp 5 ) is equivalent to the general translation patterns  ( tp2 )  , ( tp3) and ( tp4) , other than " use " and " practice " in the root nodes of the target parts  . 
4 Experiments
We have tested the alm ve-nientioned algorithm with translation patterns in a Japanese-to-English transfer dictionary that was previously used in our laboratory  . For each bgh code , we . collected translation patterns such that the root of the source part has the  . code . and a . pplied the algorithm to tim translation pattern set of each category  . Table 1 shows the resulting top 10 categories with respect to t t , e total number of occurrences . In most categorles , more than 90% of translation patterns were identified as exceptional  . The reason for the lopsidedness of , this result is that t l , e translation patterns described in the pr ( ~vious transfer dictionary were almost all exception aleases that conhl not be  . de . all with by the default procedures coded in the transfer module  . Therefore , this result indicates that the ~ dgorithmisable to idenit fy exceptional translation patterns correctly  . 
5 Discussion
In convent hmaltra , nsfl , ~r systems\[4\] , transfe rules are roughly divhled into general ones and exceptional  ( or idiomatic ) ones . The transfer system checks the ex-cepth ) nal ca . ses first , and if they cannot match the input then the system applies general rules  . On the other hand , example-based transfer systems deal with translation patterns  ( or examples ) uniformly on the basis of similarity , according to the example-b~sed pri , ciph ,  . ' ridsm ~ ci , mism causes the exanlple interference problem . A very useful property of the e?ample-I ) ~u~e ( lapproach is that it allows a sente . nce to be added as an examph ~ if it cannot be dealt with properly  . This holds if the same input : ~ s the newly added example is given ~ but when the resolution of the slmilarity calculation is not enough  , an input that is similar to but not exactly the same as the added example may not be dealt with properly  , because there may be another similar example that is exceptional  . 
' l ' here h ) re , it is very important o identify whether an example is general or exceptional  . 
After application of the alg <> rithm described in this paper  , translation patterns are classified into the fol- . 
lowing categories : general , exceptional ( extra - and intra-) , and neutral . Neutlal translation patterns , which are not ml ~ rke . d general or exceptional , are ( example )  15210 ( i dou suru )  15270 ( iku )  15310 ( to rikomu )  15600 ( tikazuku )  15710 ( kiru )  30110 ( kurushimu )  30200 ( suki )  30610 ( mnou )  31200 ( i u )  36700 ( hattyuu )  38520 ( tsukau ) Num of \] Num of-\[Num of l ' ; xceptio , ml(xtra , i , ,tra ) 247 \] 1 232 (228 ,  4) 174 \] 0 138 (137 , 1) 365 I0 160 (150 ,  10) 199  ,  1 185 (178 ,  7) 185 0 181 (159 ,  22) 192 8 183 (160 ,  23) 280 6 271 (203 ,  68) 180 0 179 (169 , 10) 1910 173 (17 a ,  0) 18'2 0 181 (108 ,  13) 65 ~ 00 (53 ,  7)
