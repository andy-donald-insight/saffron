Theoretical semantics is concerned with the modelling of meaning proper  , and computational semantics ( natural language understanding systems , machine translation , dialogue systems ) , with the modelling of communicative meaning  , or meaning as used purposefully by people in communication  ( " By uttering X with meaning proper Y the speaker intends a commun-icative maning Z '  )  . The distinction between meaning proper and communicative meaning Is difficult to make since in  every-d~7 a peech ~ which is the only observable manifestation of meaning  , people are apt to confuse the thing Itself with what it is intended to stand for as well as for some other reasons  ( e . g . that both meanings are slmultaneosly acquiredIn our childhood  )  . It is clearly cut j however , in forelgn language acquisition . In foreigh language acquisition people learn the meanings of words and expressions rather than how these meanings are used for the purposes of communl cat lon~since in the general case  , the letter Is part of their own native language knowledge  . This explains wh ~ we speak that for a Bulgarian to have learned the meaning of the English I wa~t to sleep is to have learned that in Bulgarian It has meaning equivalents llke ~ skamdas D da ~ ~ etc  . , and not to have learned that in communicative acts the former English sentence may be puPpose -fully used b ~ the speaker wlth the Intention of stating that he  ( she ) is willing to sleep , or urging someone to leave hlm ( her ) alone so that he ( she ) can sleep , and so on . Furthermore ~- 226 -we can imagine situations In which one knows the communic at-ive meanlng of a language express i on without knowing Its meaning proper  . 
Communicative meaninglles at the basis of our intuitive under ~ t and lng of language  . Understanding of language crucial-1 . y depends upon different mental processing accomplished by native speakers such as expli cating Implicit connections in sentences  , logical deducing ( Schank , Rieger ) etc . Strictly speaking , this processing does not Involve meaning proper and as such As not a part of linguistics  . In this sense , the claim made In or e . rant semantic theories that linguistic semantics should  e3plaln the In ~ It lve understanding of the language by native speakers Is not true  , unless , of course , the notion of llngulatl c meaning Is extended to meanlngle es-ness  . 
In the paper , some cases of unacceptable conceptions of l inguistic meaning In the works of semantic the orlsts are discussed  . 
For further explication of the diffe rence between mean-lng proper and communicative meaning  ( In the sense above ) classes of amblgult Ies are discussed which have different meaning proper but still their different semantic represent at-Ions preserve the same communicative mean lnE  . These classes of ambiguities share the same ( l ) referent , ( Ii ) Implication , ( Ill ) presupposition , or ( iv ) present communicative equivalents
In a less well-deflned way.
In the paper , It Isnoted that , In addition to deepening Its concept of semantics along the lines of studylng commun-I cative mean ? ng  , as an applied science , computer llnguist lossearches for strategies avoiding ~ ather than solving some of Its most difficult semantical problems  . 
: Two such strategies ar~dlscussed . One Is concerned with the tackling of the ambiguity between marked and unmarked lexlcal items  . In the other , It Isproposed that Instead of- 227-t rying to resolve some cases of A . Syntactical ambiguity , and B . Semantical ambiguity in the analysis ( e . g . for the purposes of MT ) , sentences are synthesized An the target languase which are syntactically ambiguous  ( in the same sense )   , so that the user himself , rather than the linguistic anelyser , resolves the ambiguities in question . 
A . John hit the dog with the lor ~ bat ( Schank )   ( it ls not clear whether wlth the long b~t'is smodifier of hator of do ~  ) ma ~ be translated Into Bulgarian as _D3on udarlk ~ etq which preserves the ambiguity of the original sentence  ( udarA-~~ or ~- ~ P--~I ~ MI_ ; MM ~) ? B . NOW for breakfast we shall want a fry~n~-u . n ( ~ arrls said It was And l~est l ble ; but we nearl , yurged him not to bo IP . _aa ~ . . . )( J . K . Jerome )   ( it is not clear whether for breakfast they want to eat the frying-pan Itself or just need the frying-pan to prepare their breakfast In it  ) may be translated Into Bulgarian as the struc tura ~ S_~L~L ~ ~ edlntit and as a C-aim  .   .   . ( v ~ p ~ . ~_J ~ n ~- ~ or -~ tit and a ~ zakuslm) . 
As an aid to the abovementioned strategy , all stIs made ( within dependency grammar framework ) of 36 models of structural ambiguity in English and Bulgarian  .
