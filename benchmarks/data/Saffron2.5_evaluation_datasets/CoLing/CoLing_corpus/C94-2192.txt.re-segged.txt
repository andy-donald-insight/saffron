itself does not predict anything about textual for lus of 
Nucleus and Satellite.
In order to use RST in actual text processing systems  , we have to break downs t < (' . h detinitions to relate them with I , extual forms . In this paper , we show how the defit fitions can be broken down and beass  ( )-eiated wil ; hsemaul ; iconsl ; raints betweelle on stituel g , S(clauses ) , in order t , orelate them with constraints on surface linguisl , ic forms . Among tile 24 rhetorical relations detined in \[ Mann and Thompson  ,  1987\] , we focus on presentational relations ( 7 relations are elassilied as such ) which are the most prol ) lematic . There . suits of al ) plying our met ; hodt <) leading ari ; icles in a aal ) an escnews pal ) er are also discussed . 
2 Basic Framework
In RST ,   24 relations are divided into two groups : pre-s <ntational relations and subject matter rchdious  . According to Mmm and Thomps ( m\[Malta and Thompson ,  1987\] , subject matter relations are those whose intended effect is that the reader recogldses the rela-l  ; ion in question and presentational relations are those whose intendedeft'cotisto increase some inclination in the reader  . Moore and Pollack\[Moore and Pollack , 1992\]eotlllletll , i ; hai ; subject matter relations are inf of mational and l ) resentat , ional relations are intentional . 
Table 1 shows what kind of inclination each presentational relation is in I  ; ended to increase . One can see that tile detinitions are highly abstract and have not  , h-ing to do with the surface realisations of the relations  . 
On the other hand , it has been observed that there are wu:ious surface cues in texts which are useful \[ or ideld  ; if ying in l ; er-senl , enl;ia\[(or inter-clausal ) units . 
Ilalliday and llasan\[llalli ( lay and llas an ,   1985\] iden-titled a set of linguistic devices for linking one part of a text  1  , o another , such as reJcrcnce , subslihtlion and ellipsis , conjuncliou , and \ [ exical cohesion . 
From the viewpoint of text processing , these linguis-t , it devices can be used as cuest or segment . ing a text into structural units ( Satellite and Nucleus )  . However , these cues hardly give any clue about which clause of a unit is Satellite  , which clause is Nucleus , and which relation

N desire to perforln action in N belieJ'ofN readiness to accept writer's right inN positive regard for situation presented in N positive regard t br situation presented in NRS relation combines the two clauses into a single unit  . 
For determining these , we have to look for other kinds of surface cues . 
Because RS relations are delined pragmatically , their ultimate recognition requires understanding of texts which in turn requires detailed knowledge about the world  . Furthermore , the condition that the presentational relations are inherently in tcutioual  , implies that their recognition requires knowledge about the writer's intention  , l ) lans , etc Because this kind of information is implicit in texts  , its recognition often causes proh-lelns . 
I lowew , r , though the writer's intention is implicit , certain linguistic devices give us chtesto infer it  . 
Modality inforntation in a clause , for example , expresses the writer's attitude , toward an event/state described , attd therefore , often gives us clues to recoguise a IS relation . 
Let us consider the following two examples :\[ Example  1\]   ( 1 ) I prepare documents for a meeting . 
(2) I sent them to the headol\[ice.
\[ Example2\] ( 1 ) '1 ampreparing documents t brameeting . 
(2)'1 have to send them to the head office.
Though these two examples describe pairs of similar events  , the relation between ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) in l ~ 3 xample 1 is ( temporal ) Sequence ( a subject matter relation ) because they simply describe two events which happened in sequence  . On the other hand , in l ~ 3 xample 2 ,   ( l ) ' describes an event occurring simultaneously with the utterance  , and (2)' concerns what the writer plans to do . While the two events , preparing documents and sending them , may halH ) 0 . n in this sequence , the rela-1 ; ion is not regarded as Sequence but as Background . 
(2 ) ' gives the reason why the writer is perfomling the action described by  ( l ) ' . 
This change of I . S relation occurs due to the difference of , nodality of (2) and (2)' . Our basicelai , n in that , though they cm mot determine RS relations uniquely  , inlbrmation of modality and tense of clauses imposes significant constraints on possible IS relations  , and , being used together with other surface cues like clausal conjunctions  , it ; Call reasonably restrict a set of possible discourse structures of texts without resorting to detailed knowledge about the world mid the writer's plan  . 
I Iowever , the contribution of modality and tense to the constraints of RS relations is uot straightforward  . 
Both these granunatical \[ i ~' atures are intertwiued with the propositional content of clauses  . There \ [ or e , in ofder to formulate the co ~ , straints on them properly , we have first to reveal how the intended effects of RS relations can be attained  . This leads to our breaking downsing leRS relations into sets of subschemas  , each of which is formulated in terms of the semantic re-lntions hil  ) s between propositionale ontents of clauses , their modality and temporal relations hil)s . 
3 Properties of Clauses
Like Mann and Thompson , we use clauses as the basic constituents which are related by RS relations  , except that clausal subjects and completneuts and restrictive relative clauses are considered parts of their host clause  . The constraints which we formulate for each RSre lation are exl  ) ressed in terms of prop crtic , sof clauses . In order to express the see on stra . in tst br-really , we first introduce the l ) asic terms . 
3.1 Contents and Modality
A clause comprises its Contents and Modality . Modality is the part which expresses the writer's attitude toward the Contents  . 
While individual anguages have their own linguistic devices orgrmmnatical forms of modality  , what sorts of modality are exl ) ressed by such linguistic devices does not vary from one language to another  . For example , although the major linguistic device for n lodality are modal auxiliary verbs both in l  , ' mglish anilin Japanese , some kinds of modality expressed in Japanese by modal auxiliary v  ( ' . rt ) s are expressed by lexical verbs in English , and vice versa . 1 Furtherntore , we find n la , nyphrasal or quasiq ) hrasal expressions which consist of several words , and which collectively express the writer's attitude toward lheevent/state described  . In order to treat them , we adopt a semantics-based view t br the delinition of Modality  . That is , we treat expressions which concern the writer's attitude as modal expressions  , whichew ; r linguistic forms they may take . We\[irst establish a classification schema of Modality based oH semantic considerations  ( See Section 3 . 3 ) and then treat all expressions whose functions can be classified under this schema as modal expressions  .

The same discussion as the above can be applied to Tense and Asl  ) ec : , so that all expressions whose timeron is to express ten q  ) or alaspects of chmses are , regar ( llessly of their actual forms , treated in tim same classilication schemas . Tense/Aspect are represented as properties of ( k ) nl ; eni . s ( See Section 3 . 2) .

Confidential . :34 Breaking Down of Rhetorical
Relations
In this section , we will show how Background , Enable-ment , Motivation and Evidence of the presentational relations are broken down into subschemas  , and give for lnal representations of their constraints  . The colt-straints comprise ( a ) Semantic Relationships between Contents of the two clauses  ( b ) Constraints on Time 3This is not inappropriate because it is considered that a writer COltltn its the action in the Clause with full confidence in his/her action  . 
(c ) Constraints on Modality.
( b ) and ( e ) are expressed by using a characterisation of clauses of Section  3  . We first show the framework for ( a ) and then give the actual breakdown of presentational relations  . 
4.1 Semantic Relations
By semantic relationships between Contents we mean the relationships between states/actions/events described by Contents in the extralinguistic world  . 4 As we neeill Example I and 2 , even when two action seem to stand in the same semantic relationship  , they can be used to attain dilferent effects on a reader by adding different expression of a writer 's attitude as Modality or putting them in ? lifferent emporal relationships  . 
We classify semantic relationships into five categories  , four of which also are subject matter relations in RST  . That is , if two Contents are presented without any Modality  , they stand in the corresponding subject matter elations  . We use the following symbols in their definitions . 
Cli : Clausei composed of Contents and Modality
Ci : Coutents of ' Clausei
Si : Contents of Clausei whose Type is Static Ai : Contents of Clause i whose Type is not Static 
Mi : Mod Mityin Clausei \ [ Semantic Relations \] A/~causes a situation change froln b'i to Sj  . If a Content states that Akcauses a situation , 5' j , Si will be omitted . 
?&I = ct ~
Clj is held true or acceptable m the environment stated in N  . If Clj expresses a situation , this relation is the same as Circumstance . 
?, 5' i ~- CIj
Clj is held true or acceptable , if , 5' i is true . If CIj expresses an action caused by El , this relation is the same as Causeaud Result . 
?5i ~> Aj
Si has the possibility to resolve the problem stated in Aj  . This relation is the salne as Soluliouhood . 
? ci~cj
Ci presents additiouul details about Cj or is in -ferentially accessible in Cj in one or more ways  . 
This relation is the same as Elaboraliou.
4 One may argue that such relat ionships have to be called pragmat ic  , t to wever , we adopt a rather narrow definition of the tern t praflmatic and a broad definition of the term semantic  . 
Well SO , tn'agr ~ aticollly when it co(lcertls effects Oli . Feadel's or the intention of the writer . The rest , like relationships held in the extra-llnguist ic worhl  , are called * emantic issues .

Figure 1: Sample text ? Background ( 6 ) between '4' and '56' Tim semantic relation is that abad situation in sentence  '4'   ( unsettle market ) will be resolved by pertbrming an actiou in '56' ( show are so htl , eattitude ) . Sentence '56' has 1) irective modality . 
These satisfy the consl ; raints of the 6th subschema of llaekground . 
? Background(g ) between '7' and '8-.9'
The situation '7' ( dollar is a key ) is held true , so Contents '89' ( effect of bad in lhmnce ) is true . 
These satisfy the constraints of the 7th subsche . maofllackgrou , M .

In this paper , weln : OpOSC further a breakdown of the im ~sentational relations in liST into their subschenms  . 
The subschenias represeut strategies by which two states/actions/events which stand in certaill senmntic relationships caube used t  . cJ at tniuinte , ldcdeF-li~cts on readers By associating the definitions of the relations with formally stated const\]'ainl  , s , these sub-schemas help hUll Utllanalysts to recognise them in texts  , and thus improw : lIST as an analytical tool , Moreover , because characterisation\[clatlSeSillSo ( > lion 3 , especially Modality and Tense/Aspect , are accompanied hytheir actual linguistic rcalisal  ; ions , some parts of the consl , raints stale dillSccLion4 can readily I ) e associated with texl ; ual\['orms and be used\[or\[ , ext processing systems . Although constraints on semantic relM ; ionsbel ; we cn(~ont , ents can only beevah ml , ed by refin'ence to a knowledge base , we expect that , ewm without constraints on semail ticrel ~ d , ions , the other constraints can be used I ; or estrict a set of l > ossible inter-clausalsl , rltcl , /lres of texts .
