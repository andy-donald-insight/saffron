We address a dialogue framework that narrows down the users query results obtained by an in  formation retrieval system  The follow  updia  logue to constrain query results is signicantes  pecially with the speech interfaces such as tele  phones because a lot of query results cannot be presented to the user  The proposed dialogue framework generates guiding questions based on an information theoretic criterion to eliminate retrieved candidates by a spontaneous query without assuming a semantic slot structure  We  rst describe its concept on general information query tasks  and then deal with a query task on the appliance manual where structured task knowledge is available  A hierarchical conrmation strategy is proposed by making use of a tree structure of the manual  and then three cost functions for selecting optimal question nodes are compared  Experimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed system helps users  nd their intended items more e  ciently  Introduction In the past years  a great number of spoken dialogue systems have been developed  Their typical task domains include airline information  Levin et al  Potamianos et al  San  Segundo et al  and train information  Allen et al  Bennace fet al  Sturm et al  Lamel et al  Most of them model speech understanding process as convert  ing recognition results into semantic represent a  tions equivalent to database query  SQL com  m and s  and dialogue process as disambiguating their un  xed slots  Usually  the semantic slots are de  neda priori and manually  The approach is workable only when data structure of the ap plication is well  organized typically as a rela  tional database  RDB 
Di  erent and more  exible approach is needed for spoken dialogue interfaces to a ccess information described in less rigid format  in particular normal text database  For the purpose  information retrieval  IR technique is useful to  nd a list of matching documents from the input query  Typically  keywords are ex  tracted from the query and statistical matching is performed  Callrouting task  Chu  Carroll and Carpenter  can be regarded as the special case  In IR systems  many candidates are usually obtained as a query result  thus there is a signicant problem of how to  nd the users in  tended item among them  Especially  either on the telephone or electrical appliances  there is not a large screen displaying the candidates  and all the query results cannot be presented to a user  So it is desirable for the system to narrow down the query results interactively  Moreover  interactive query is more friendly to novice users rather than requiring them to input a detailed query from the beginning  In this paper  we address a dialogue strategy to  nd the users intended item from the retrieved result  which is initiated by a spon  taneous query utterance  In section   we de  scribe a method to generate a guiding question that narrows down the query results e  ciently  using an example of a restaurant query task  The question is selected based on an informa  tion theoretic criterion  In section   we present a dialogue management method for a query task on the appliance manual where structured task knowledge is available  We propose a con  rmation strategy by making use of a tree struc  ture of the manual  and de  ne three cost functions for selecting question nodes  The method is evaluated by the number of average dialogue turns  
Although there are previous studies on optimizing dialogue strategies  Niimi and 
Kobayashi   Levin et al  Litman et al  most of them assume the tasks of  lling semantic slots that are de  nitely and manually de  ned  and few focus on follow  updialogue of information retrieval  For example  Denecke   proposed a method to generate guiding questions by making use of a tree struc  ture constructed by unifying retrieved items based on semantic slots  In this paper  we do not assume any structure of semantic slots  In  stead  we make use of distribution of document statistics or a structure of task knowledge  We also investigate cost functions for optimal dia  logue control by taking into account of speech recognition errors  Dialogue Strategy in General 
Information Query Task
Interaction in an information query task can be regarded as a process seeking a common part between the users request and system knowl  edgeIn order to help users to  nd their in  tended items from the system knowledge  the system has to carry out not only interpreting what users say but also showing the relevant portion of the system knowledge to them  We assume that users freely set and retract query keys based on their preference for information query systems  If many candidates still remain even after specifying all possible his  her preference to the system  users may have di   culty in narrowing down further the query re  sult  Thus  the system should generate e  cient guiding questions to help users  nd their in  tended items  In this section  we presume the system knowl  edge as a pair of an item and a set of keywords  Figure  Wede  nekey words as a set of words representing contents of the items  and their categories such as place  food and so on are given  This is similar to indexing words in a conventional information retrieval task  Note that it is not needed that the system knowledge is structured like an RDBKeywords are extracted from a user  sutter  ance  and are matched with the system knowledgeHere  we adopt the following matching 

By calculating HA for all conditions A that can be added to the current query condition  the system generates the question that has the maximum value of H  A  The question is gen  erated using the category information of each keyword  Because the obtained condition A is selected by a viewpoint of narrowing down the current set of items e  ciently  the selected condition may be unimportant for the userIn such a case  it is not cooperative to force the user a narmative or negative reply  Our system does not force the reluctant decision by allowing the user to say  It does not matter any how  Instead  the system presents the second best proposal  We explain the method with the following example in our restaurant query system in the Tokyo area  When a user says  Please tell mea restaurant where I can eat Chinese noodle and meat dumpling in Shinjuku area  three key  words are extracted   Shinjuku   Chinese noodle  and  meat dumpling  As a result of the matching using these three keywords  query results are obtained  It is not cooperative to read out all of the query results with a TTS text  to  speech system  Here  the expected values of amount of information HA are calculated for each condition that corresponds tokey  words included in the matched items except for the three keywords  Shinjuku   Chinese noo dle  and  meat dumpling  Then  we select the keyword  noodles with boiled  pork  ribs  that has the maximum value HABy generating a question like  Would you like one which serves no odles with boiled  pork  ribs  and obtaining a reply from the user  the system adds the new condition and narrows down the candidate sef   ciently  If the user thinks that the condition  no odles with boiled  pork  ribs  is not important and tells the system so  for example  Ei  ther will do   the system can show the second best proposal   Would you like one located in Kabukicho area    Thus  the query result can be narrowed down without forcing the user un  naturalyes  no answers   Dialogue Strategy for Query on
