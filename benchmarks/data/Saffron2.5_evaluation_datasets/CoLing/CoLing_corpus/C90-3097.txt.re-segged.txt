Paralleling recent shifts within
Grammatical Theory away from rule-based and toward principle-based systems  , there has arisen widespread interest in the possibility of similar refocusing with respect to natural language processing  ( cf . Abney (1988) , Berwick & Weinberg (1984) , Clark (1987) , Fong (1990) , Gibson (1987) , Johnson (1988) , Kashket (1988) , Pritchett (1987 ,  1988 ,  1990 , in press , forthcoming ) , Stabler (1989) , among others ) . 
Fundamental to principle-based as opposed to rule -based models of parsing is the hypothesis that the Parser itself adheres to a version of the Projection Principle which maintains that each level of syntactic representation is a projection of the lexical properties of heads  . 
With respecto parsing , the PP implies that a node emmet be projected before the occurrence of its head since the relevant features which determine its categorical identity and license its own and its arguments ' attachment are there to foreun determined  . This paper describes an ongoing project in the implementation f an object-oriented  ( Small talk-80TM ) Government and Binding parser which adheresto I hestrong competence hypothesis that principles of Universal Grammar are emp ! oye directly in parsing  . Specifically , the parse operates by projecting phrasal structure as determined by the lexical properties of heads and licensing local attachments which maximally satisfy online principles of Universal Grammar at every point during a parse  . Though this model was originally motivated with regard to its psychological plausibility  , in this paper wetb cus primarily on issues of implementation  ( see Pritchett:op . cir . for a more detaile discussion of the psycho ! inguistic issues  )  . 
In the implemented parser , the following new Object subclasses are defined :












The ta Role Assignment

SpecHead Agreement
XP Selection
An instance of Principle Based Parser ( henceforth simply the parse , ') itself7 acts as the buffer for tree structures . The parse of a string succeeds if at the end of input  , there is exactly one tree in the parser and all grammatical principles are satisfied for every Node in that tree  . 
The syntactic structures actually created and manipulated by the parser are subinstances of the class Node  . Nodes accord with a binary-branching version of X ' Theory and each Node exists as an element of a maximal projection :\[ xP\[vP\]\[x'\[X\ ]\[ zP\]\]\]  . Phrase Structure constraints on the linear order of Nodes is specified in the pool variable  , Head Parameter ; in this note we assume the English configuration . 
The specifier and complement positions themselves are either fully specified maximal projections or instances of the special class Empty Node  . Nodes respond in the expected fashion to a range of messages concerning e on figurational structure  , such as c-commands : , m-commands : : , governs : , mother , sister , etc . 
Each Node may be associated ( coindexed ) wittlother Nodes via an instance of the class chain  , a subclass of Sorted Collection , where Nodect precedes Node 13 in an instance of Chain if fac-commands 13  . Given this definition , two Nodes may cooccur within the same Chain only if they are contained in the same tree structure  . Every Node has an associated Chain , though in the default case a Node is the Chain ' ssingleton member  . For a Node to be globally licit , all relevant grammatical principles must be satisfied with respect to aits Chain  . 
Subinstances of tt ~ e abstract class
Licensing Relation represent heactual principles of Grammar which license Nodes  , such as the 0-criterion and Case Theory . Each Node keeps track of all licensing relations in which it participates via the instance variables licenser Relations licensee Relations  . 
As an illustration of the model as discussed so far  , consider how a simple sentence , 
Vampires were seen , is processed.
This sentence is fed to the processor one PF-word at a time by the procedure : 
I parser \] parser <- Principle Based Parser new English Parser ? parser new Word  . 'vampires'parser newWord:'wex"e'parser new Word : ' seen '% parser output First a parser with an English lexicon and English parameter settings  ; ( e . g . the 1437
Head Parameter ) is created by sending
Principle Based Parser the message new Engli sh Parser  . Next , the string'vampires'issent to the parser with the message new Word:  , which operates as follows : new Word : a Word\[ lexical Item maximal Projection I maximal Proje ction < -- I exicon project : a Word  . 
self add Last : maximal Projection.
self changed
The lexicon is queried and returns a maximal projection in response to the message project : ' vampires '  . This maximal Projection :\[ . xv\[e\][~ , \ [ yvampires\]\[e\]\]\] is added to the parser  , where the e indicates instances of the class Empty Node  , which may ultimately be filled by ore o indexed with other Nodes  . 
Next , and crucial to the online application of grammatical principles  , the changed message is sent , indicating that the parser's contents have altered and signaling that the reapplication of grammatical principles is relevant  . Whenever the parse receives the message changed , it is automatically sent the message update : by the  Smalltalk-80 TM system , which is defined as follows : update : dummy self attach Last Two Trees  . 
self expand LastTree.
self build Chains In Last Tree
The most important message in this method is attach Last Two Trees where in the  0-criterion and Case Theory ( among others ) actively determine attachments . Furthermore , if any of the three message sent by update : itself makes changes to the parser's contents  , it too will in turns end changed messages to the parser  , again triggering the sending of update : . Intla is way , the parser manipulates its contents continually until a local steady state is reached with all grammatical principles maximally satisfied  . Hence , this changed/update : message sequence is fundamental to the parser's operation as it is in this fashion that grammatical principles are represented as online in the system  . 
Returning to the example , none of the messages within update has any effect when the parser comains only the NP v mnpires  , and the parse reaches a steady state with no licenser available and the NP unavoidably left locally role ! ess  . No higher structure , including IP , is projected as relevant heads have not been encounter S  . 
Next , the word ' were ' is sent to the parser , and its maximal projection , an I_P , added :\ [ yp\[e\]\[~ , \[~vampires\]tell\] , tip\[e\][i , \[ i were\[e\]\]\] . As a result , a changed message is sent , and the update : message's method is executed . This time , the message attach Last Two Trees will have an effect  . This method examines the last two trees in the parser and attempts all possible attachments of one into positions in the other  . The method then chooses the attachment which is licensed to the highest degree  . An attachment is defined as licensed to degree n if by making the attachment  , n different licensing relations will be newly discharged  .   ( See Pritchett cited above for psycholinguistic justification of this selection procedure as well as some alternative approaches to the notion ' maximally licensed '  . ) Given adjacency requirements , two attachments are considered In this example : the attachment of the IP into the complement of NP and the attachment of the NP into the specifier of IE Only the second results in the discharge of alicensing relation  , namely the case assigned by I under government . Hence , this attachment is chosen , so that the parser now contains only one element :\[ Iv\[vampires\]it'\[~were\]\[e\]\] \]  . The requirements of Case Theory are satisfied to the maximum degree possible in the local string- both with respecto the target NP which requires these features and the head which must discharge them  . 
Next the method expand Last Tree is sent . In this case , the method causes the IP to expand into a CEAs a result  , the contents of the parser becomes : \[ cv\[e\ ] [ c'\[c\]tip\[vampires\]it'\[i were \] tel\]I\]\]  . The last message in the method for update : , build Chains In Last Tree is sent but has no effect . Since the first two messages sent in update : caused changes to the contents of the parser  , they both send changed messages , with the result that update : is executed again . 
However , none of the three messages in update : has any effect this time around as there is a single tree in the parser  , and a local steady state has been reached , with all structure licensed to the maximum degree possible with respect to UG principles  . 
Finally , the word seen is sent to the parser.
Seen is identified as a passive participle which , as a lexical property , assigns an internal0-role but no Case . In the VP which is projected , the V acts as the licenser in a licensing relation  , namely an instance of The ta Role Assignment under government  . Again , since the parser's contents have changed , update : is sent , invoking attach Last Two Trees forcing the VP attachment as a complement of IN t  , L:\[cptel\[c'\[c\]tip\[vampires\]it '\[ twere\]\[\[vP\[e\]iv'\[v seen\] \[ e\]\]\]\]\]\]\]  .   ( This is carried out by means of an instance of XP Selection - a subclass of Licensing Relation relevant of unctional heads  . )
The message xp and Last Tree is sent but has no effect  . Next , the message build Chains In Last Tree is sent . The method associated with this message attempts to associate Nodes and Empty Nodes  ( through Chain building ) in order to more fully satisfy Case TheeD ' and the  0-criterion   . In this example the empty complement of VP is added to the Chain associated with the NP vampires and the V's  0-role assigned to this empty position . As a 4382 result , the Chain possesses both a 0-role and Case since its head ( the NP ) is in a Case position and its tail ( the empty node ) in 0-position . The contents of the parser are now :\[ cP\[e\ ] [ c'\[c\]\[iP\[NP vampires\]l\[l'\[ I were \]\[\[ ve\[e\]Iv'\[v seen\]\[e\ ]l\]\]\]\]\]\]  . Input terminates and the message output is sent to the parser  , which checks that all mandatory licensing relations have been fulfilled and returns the final structure  . 
At this point , we will briefly discuss how the head-driven principle-based model here predicts certain psycholinguistic facts  . This discussion will be schematic and the reader is refen'ed to Pritchett  ( op . cit . ) . Consider for example , wellknown garden-path effects of the sort found in an example like  , After John drank the water evaporated Informally , the problem for the human parser in such examples is that the postverbal NP is prematurely construed as the complement of the verb  , which causes difficulty when it must be reinterpreted as a subject  . In terms of our implementation , once the parser has been sent the words up through water  , it contains the following tree :\[ cP\[e\]\[ c'\[cafter\]  ~1  , \[NPJohn\]\[i'\[Iel\]\[\[ve\[e\] Iv'\[vdrank:t\]\[nr the water\]\]\]\]\]\] \]  . Subsequently , the word evaporate dissent , and the projected VP added to the parser , however there is no licensing position into which it can attach  . This remains true when the VP subsequently expands to IP and CP:\[CP\[e\][C'\[C\ ]l IP\[e\]\[I'\[Ie\]\[\[VP\[eliIv ' \[vevaporatedl\]\[e\]\]\]\]\]\]\]  . The initial misanalysis of the NP the water results from the parser's premature construal of a global subject as a local object in order to satisfy Case and  0-theory   , which results in global failure . The reason that reanalysis is not possible in instances of this sort is due to the hypothesis licensed positions are indelible and is discussed in detail in Prite hett  ( op . cit . ) . What is crucial is that a principle-based parser of this sort makes the initial parsing error as a result of its fundamental strategy to maximally satisfy grammatical principles locally at every point during the parse  . 
The architecture of the parser also arguably provides a processing  , as opposed to a grammatical , account of effects deriving from Huang's ( 1982 ) Constraint on Extraction
Domains which prohibits movement from within posit ions which are not properly governed  . For example , it proscribes examples such as , * Whoidopic tures of eibother John . 
To give just one example , according to our parsing-theoretica count , extraction from within subjects is impossible since there is simply no local option of forming the requisite chain at the time the subject constituent is being parsed  , given the fact that the parser is strictly head driven  . Recall that a sentence ( IP ) is not projected until either an inflectional element or a verb possessing inflectional features is processed  . Before a category is projected , it is impossible to license its specifier , the subject . 
Consequently , in the previous example , after the word of is processed , the parser contains the following two unintegrated Nodes:Ice\[NP who\]\[c'\[c do \]\[ e\]\]\]  , and\[yp\[el\[s'\[spictures\]\[pp\[p of \]\[ e\]\]\]\]\]  . These two Nodes cannot be locally integrated before the projection of IP and hence the requisite Chain cannot be formed between the wh -word in SPEC-CP into the NP pictures of as the two phrases are not locally constituents of the same parse tree  . in other words , the NP is not locally a subject at that point during the parse but i  , ; rather unattached . 
See Pritchett ( to appear ) for details . Thus our implementation begins to provide an existence proof that a parser driven by the Projection Principle and the on  . -line application of global grammatical principles is both psychologically and implementationally realistic  .
