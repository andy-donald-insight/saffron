TEXAN is a sysLem of bransfer, . oriented text analysis . 
Its linguistic concept is based on a communicative appY ' oacll within the framework of speech act theory  . 
In this view texts are considered to be the resul t of linguistic actions ? It is assumed that they control the selection of translat ionequivalents  . The trans-ition of this concept of linguis tic actions  ( text acts ) to the model of computer analysis is performed by a context-free illocution grammar processing categories of actions and a proposit ional structure of states of affairs  . The grammar whicl l is related to a text lexicon provides the connection of these catego-ries and the linguistic surface units of a single language  . 
I . The Problem
One of the main tasks of machine translation , besides the resolution of ambiguities and the generation of appropriate structural analyses  , is tlle selection of adequate translation equivalents  . It has been Found that an analysis which even produces unequivo calre-suits does not suffice for the production of pragma-tically adequate texts in the target language  . 
a different text type it may be right or even must have this form  . On the other hand , regulations ( REGU-LATE ) differ in verb forms . Thus in German present tense is to be used , in English shall-forms , and in French present and future may be alte rnatives  . A general principle is , that the participants never are pronominalize ( lo The question now is what kind of linguist i c model can hell  ) us to structure there\] . evan L components of the analysis system ?2 . Concept of Text Acts ( TA ) Our system needs a linguistic model in which content  , function and form of lingusitic expressions in a text are connected  . We think that a ~ ood concept for this purpose may be the concept of text acts  ( Rothkel 1984 )  . TA are speech acts in which texts are produced . 
When we translate , we are producing a new text . 
We follow Searle's analysis of speecll acts into illo-cutionary  , propositional and locutionary parts and assume  , with respect to texts , the existence of three There are problems wiLh respect to the selection of appropriate lexemes  , collocations , idiomatic expressions on the one hand . On the otller hand we have to know what kind of syntactic patterns and anaphorica \] or ellip tical constructions usually are applied with respect to t  . he text type . What we need is informa Lionon cummunicative norms  . In addition to a syrYt acLic and/or semantic analysis we have to provide a pragma-tic component especially in order to solve problems on the \] eve\]of transfer ? The notion that l inguistic usage and tlle selection of rneans of expression  ( \] exis and syntax ) is directed by or at least influenced by- communicative intent-ions has received increasing attention witll respect to problems of translation ? Recent research in this are a include communicative grammars for foreign-\ ] an ~ guage learning  ( e . g . Leech/Svartvik 1975) , but also more specific Studies which explic ity Lake account of text function  ( ReiS/Vermeer 1984 . , ThJel 1980 ) and aspects of action in texts ( HOnig/Ku Smaul 1982 )  . These studies have influenced the theoretical foundations of TEXAN to the extent t tlat we view communicative aspects as decisive for the solut ion of translation problems  . 
Some stlort examples of our texts ( interacting-regula ~ Ling texts , especially international treaties ) may illustrate this approach . We should know when aspe ~ ciai pattern has to be applied in different languages and when iL has to be changed  . It has been found in these texts that there is a special type of defini-tion  ( DEFINE ) with lexical restrictions and which al- ways is realized by participle constructions in Eng-lish  , German , French , Ita \] ien , etc . A translation by a relative clause , e . g . in German , would be wrong . In parts of text acts ( I : text illocution ; T : tllematic specification of Bile proposi tional part  ; R : reper-toires of lexical and grammatical expressions which are typically used For a specific communicative task  )   . 
\] A : ( l,T,R )
Automatic procedures fortile processing of speech act basically have to do with the selection and represen-tation of contextual factors ? They determine the assignment oF illocutions to linguistic utterances  ( Gazdar 1981 )  . What models developed for this purpose have in common is the use of overall schemas whithin which the respective speech acts can be interpreted  . While Evans ( 1981 ) l l and les general definitions of situat ion  , Al\]en/Perrault (1980) , Cohen ( 1978 ) and Grosz ( 1982 ) use general action plans in which the speech acts oF interest are embedded  . This principle , which is appl-ied to dialogues in the models mentioned  , we have applied to written texts in TEXAN ( example of an art . .
icle in Fig . l).
3 . Model of Analysis lheanalysis of text acts is or iented conceptually in a topdown fashion  . Intile context of machine processing , however , we have to rely on the linguistic surface as input data  . TEXAN is a system which builds on other programs already completed within our project  . 
We use a syntax parser ( SAIAN , cf . SALEM 1980) , for instance , which provides a description of constituent structure and valencies  . Furthermore , we use a program for ease-grammatical analysis ( PROLID , cf . Harbusch/Rothkege \] 1984 ) which provides a role interpretation on the description of constituent structure  . Input into TEXAN , then , is a complete structural and case-relation a l description of sentences  . This determines

In priciple , the task here is to bundle the available information on syntax  , lexis and thematic roles in a form suitable to the determination of the underlying illocut ion  . Nevertheless , the concept of text acts is the basis for the structure of data  . We distinguish the following components ( Fig . 2):\[ZZZE~~text~text representation

The components of the automatic analysis are GRILL  ( grammar of illocutions )   , TEL ( text lexicon ) and TEF ( sequence of propositions of the text )   . INT ( schema of interpretation for the structure of states of af-fairs and communicative tasks  ) and HAS ( action structure of the text ) are preconditions in order to formulate the rules of GRILL  . ' text'represents the input structure . This means that the sentences are syn-tactica lly analyzed and ordered according to a propo-si tional listing  . ' text representation ' is output in the form of Fig  . I . 
In the following we will sketch the structure of the components  . 
INT represents the structure in which knowledge of states of affairs is embedded into knowledge of ling-uistic action  . It consists of 4 parts which can be combined . States of affairs ( see Fig . 3): ( a ) action s(a(x , ( y ) ,   ( z )   )   ) states of affairs occur as actions/interact ions  ( a ) of/between participants ( xl , x2 .   .   .   . ) and re-

Fig .  3  ( b ) states of affairs occur as events concerning abstract objects : b  ( z )   ( c ) situation ( m , n , o , p .   .   .   .   ) actions are embedded in a situation described by parameters of time  , location , personal relationship , domain , procedures , etc . 
336  ( d ) the verbalization of an action can be seen in the status of condition  , norm , purpose , permission , etc . 
Linguistic actions :
They are interpretations of states of affairs with respect to communicative Basks and can be described as predications on propositions  . Thus we can add several types of illocutions to  ( a ) - ( d )  . Examples are:
CONCRETIZE(a(x , ( y),(z)))
FIX(condition(b(z )))
HAS ( Fig .  4 ) represents the action structure of ' trea ~ ties of trade ' in terms of text acts  . Our example in Fig . 1 shows a segment of REGULATE ( case ) .

TEL represents the text lexicon . According to the two tasks of TEXANTEl_includes hwo sections of information : an idenhification section concerning the text act structure  ( TAS ) which is described by types of il-locution and roles such as REGULATE  ( case )   , SPECIFY ( object ) , etc . , and a selection section consisting of l i s ts of repertoires which belong to several single languages  ( TAE : R ( LI .   .   .   .   . Ln ) . As a third par\[a key ( K ) is established which provides the connection of input data and the TA-information  . On the level of simple illocutions the key represented by the lemma of the head of the respective phrase  ; on the level of complex illocutions the key is the illocuhion of a lower level  . 
An entry of IEL has the following design : TELl : I  . key ( lemma or illocution c ) 2 . TAS(I/T ) 3 . TAE(R(LI:\],g)
R(L2:l , g)
R . ( LAIl , g))
It is possible that one key corresponds to several entries of TEL  . This is the case if there are different

GRILL provides rules which represent the structure of INT and HAS and which transform them into procedures  . 
GRILL ( grammar'ofil\]ocutions ) has such a form that it can be processed by a contextfree grammar parser  . A parser has been developed according to the structure of the programming language COMSKEE  . Elements of the TEF-component ( listing of propositions of the text ) are integrated as parameter ( F ) into the rules .
