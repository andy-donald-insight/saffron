The following paper discusses the preparation of syntactic data for use in a generalized language translation system j developed by the Linguistics Research Center at The University of Texas  . Capabilities and limitations of translation by syntactic model are outlined and compared with the word-for-word model  . 
TOSt ! 1

In January of this year the Linguistics Research Center held its first demonstra tion of an operational system for experiment a l translation oF languages  . We prepared n limited set of test data and used a pre-selected input text to demonstra te the operational status of computer programs in the system  . I shall discuss briefly the model on which the translation system is based and the preparation of  lin-1 guistic data used in the demonstration . 
LINGUISTICSRESEARCtlCENTER
Two principalobiectives at the Linguist ics Research Center have been the development o fageneralized automatic translatiun system and the development of a lin-guisti cs computer system consisting of programs des igned to facilitate the collection and maintenance of data for the translation system \  [7  \ ]  . In addition to these objec-tives , we have undertaken related studies in info rmation retrieval and automatic class if ication  \[1  ,  2\ ]  . The phil-osophy behind our research effor t may be characterized as one of seeking general solutions to language description and translation as opposed to one of designing specialized 
TOSH2 algorithms . The general principles underlying our research have be Bn discussed elsewhere  ) and I shall not d well on them here\[4 ;  5 ;  6 ;  8 , pp .  314; 9\] . 
Three organizational subdivisions of the Center are the Theoretical Linguistics Group  , the Descriptive Linguistics Group and the Systems Group  . Activities at the Center are distributed over these and other specialized are : ~ s in order to facilitate research  . Results reported in this paper are presented from the point of view of  acti-2 vities in the Descriptive Linguistics Group . 
The Descriptive Linguistics Group is currently engaged in maintaining research data in six languages : Chinese  , English , German , Hebrew ) Russian and Spanish . 
We are also maintaining data for independent ) non-supported rescarch in Hindi and Old Saxon . We have just begun maintaining data for Japanese . Plans are being made to add French to the data in the Linguistics Research System in the near future  . 
LINGUISTICSRESE ARCIISY STEM
The Linguistics Research System is a hierarchical system of computer programs  ) which , in addition to programs in the experimental translation system  , includes programs designed to support a stratified description of language data 
TOSH3 ( seef old-out entitled LINGUISTICS RESEARCH SYSTE ~  )  . In the illustration the large boxes marked k ~ AINTAIN ANCE at the upper and lower part of the page represent the system of programs in which we collect and maintain language and descriptive linguistic data  . The system of large boxes running across the middle of the page represents the translat ion system  . Details of these programs will be found in  \[8  , pp .  83 -103\ ]  . I outline the functions of pro-grams in the translation system below  . 
TRANS LATION ~ ! ODELS
Various models have been proposed for automatic translation of languages  . The models have been character-ized into at least three levels of increasing complex i ty and sophistication :  1  . Word-for-word , 2 . Rule-for-rule or syntactic , 3 . Transformational-semantic . The inade-quacies of type 1 . are known . ~lest of current investipa-tionisconcent rated in some form or other on type  2   .   , while type 3 , models remain largely speculative . Trans-lation programs have been completed which will simulate models  1  . and 2 . 
In model 1 . we may perform word-for-word trans-lat i on by presenting an input corpus  ( seef old-out ) to
TOSH4 the LEXICAL ANALY SIS program . Analysis results in recognition of whatever forms have been defined in the lexical grammar  . The results are transferred from the analysis program in ~ ONOLINGUAL RECOGNITION to the LEXICAL ANALY SIS program in INTERLINGUAL RECOGNITION  . Intermediate display programs are ordinarily by passed in the translation mode  . 
The data then pass to an INPUTTRANSFER tape before entering the TRANSFER program  . This program processed INPUTTRANSFER data against data from the INTERLINGUA tape to produce an OUTPUTTRANSFER tape  . OUTPUTTRANSFER data pass into the LEXICAL SYNTIIESIS program in INTERLINGUAL PRODUCTION to be converted to an acceptable form for input to LEXICALSYNTIIESIS in HONOLINGUAL PRODUCTION  . The resulting data pass onto the OUTPUTCORPUS tape which serves as input to the CORPUSDISPLAY program  . 
Output from this lowest level of translation would be word-for-word  , morph-for-morph , etc . matching the order of input forms . There would be no control over output morphology or syntax  . We have not considered it worthwhile to attempt to use model I  . translation independently of model 2 . 
Model 2 . translation in the Linguistics Research System performs in a fashion operationally similar to model i  . Instead of operating ( horizontally on the fold-out ) directly through the lexical level , however , we initiate
TOSH 5 the translation input in LEXICAL ANALYSIS and pass the resulting data  ( vertically ) into SYNTACTICANALYSIS . 
Model 2 . translation now continues horizontally on the syntactic level analogously to the manner described for tile lexical level  . 
Output resulting from the syntactic translation model observes the requirements for wellformedness in output language morphology and syntax  . Examples from the January demonstration are given below  . With large volumes of grammar data , this model is not expected to provide all the semantic collocational controls which we as linguists will want to maintain  . Norwill it properly account for problems such as pronominal reference  . These and other transformational problems will be dealt within a still higher order of description and programming  . The semantic order of programming has only recently been undertaken  . 
The translation model used in the January demonstration is essentially a type  2  . model , although it contains some features proposed for type  5  . models . Analysis is performed on the input language with a contextfree phrase structure grammar  . The structures which are thus identified are transformed into equivalent output language structures by the socalled transfer grammar  . Translation output is then generated through a contextfree phrase structure grammar o ? the output language  \[15\]  . 
TOS tl 6
Rules for use in a similar model are given by Ilse Langerhans \  [3  \ ]  . The essential difference , however , between our model and that proposed by Langerhans is that in the latter the input language is analyzed into kernels  , the kernels matched with equivalent output lan -guage kernels  , and the output language kernels transformed in to finished expressions  . 
PREPARATION OFDATA
For the demonstration , we selected a text in psychology to use as a test corpus in German  , the input language ( Appendix A ) . The corpus consisted of the first six paragraphs of an essay appearing in UNIVERSITAS\[  I0\]  . 
Members of our staff then prepared an English translation to be used as a test corpus in the output language  ( Appendix B )  . We use test corpora for verifying the morphosyntactic description in each language before attempting to use the grammars in the translation system  . To illustrate the details of data preparation , I have chosen the second sentence from the third paragraph of text  ( Fig . I ) . 
This sentence was chosen for reasons of simplicity and economy of description  . It is typical , however , of transformational problems in syntactic translation  . We pro-

TOS ~ I 8 vided a phrase structure description for the sentence  , labelling those features of construction which would be necessary for morphosyntactic  ( as opposed semantic ) grammaticality in German . The description contains , therefore , more information than is necessary for recognition  . But we are designing our grammars , in general , for bidirectional use . A similar description was provided for the English translation  ( Fig .  2) . 
After diagramming each sentence , we encoded the information contained ill the diagrams ill an equivalent phrase structure notation  \[14\]  . The data were then compiled in the computer system  . As rules are compiled for each language , each rule is randomly assigned a permanent identification number  . After the respective grammars are compiled and displayed  , we refer to them for the identification of each rule and record the appropriate number by each occurrence of a rule in the diagram  . 
The diagrams then appear as in Figures 3 and 4.
VERIFICATION OF DATA
To insure that a description for any given sentence is complete  , we perform analysis on tlle sentence in the computer  , using the grammar data accumulated up to that point  . If automatic analysis is successful , we ex-

If auto-matic analysis is incompIete , we reconstruct the rules needed and ( re ) compile them in the grammar . I shall not go into the details of analys is here  , as they have been presented elsewhere\[8 ,  12 ,  13\ ]  . 
TRANS LATION ALTRANSFOR ~; IATIONS
After we verified the descriptions in each language  , we went on to define the basis of interlin -gual transformation relationships  . We selected a pair of sentences , one from each of the two languages . They are defined as equivalent in meaning by bi-lingual in-formants  . Given the pair of sentences , we mapped corres-ponding sub-structures from one sentence onto the other  . 
This information was recorded on the diagrams by circum-scribing the sub-structures  ( Fig . S ) . Normally these lines are added directly to the diagrams  . For the sake of simplicity , I have omitted branching diagrams and class names from the illustrations  . After we established the correspondences between each pair of sub-structures  , we inspected each sub-structure to see of what it was 
TOS tt 13 composed . I have represented this information in Figures 6 and 7 by the rule number ( s ) contained in each substructure . 
Suppose now we want to " transforms " i . e . ~ translate the expression Be wusstse in into the expression consciousness  . Be wusst sein ( Figs .  3 ,  6 ) is represented by the rule 42321: NIOW ? Be wusst sein Consciousness ( Figs .  4 ,  7 ) is represented by the rule 27951: NSF ? consciousness We define the equivalence of these two expressions by writing the bi- directional transformation Tx :  \[42321\]g + Tx + \[27951\] eThis is equivalent to writing a reversible transformation between the structures of Figure R  .

Similarly , we may translate from an infinitive construction in the one language into a corresponding construction in the other  . The infinitive of umschreib-is formed with-en by the rule  628: INF/ACSTV ? V12A + enThe corresponding English construct ion is formed by the rule  359: VRBL ? VPR1A + eWe record thus the transformation Ty \[6281 ? T ? \[359\] gye to define the translation equivalence . This is equivalent to writing the transformation in Figure  9  .

Tileforegoing examples are typical of the many rule-for-rule correspondences to be found in a pair of structurally similar languages  . 
Of greater interest are those transformations of pairs of structures which are dissimilar in terms of constituent rules  . In Figure 6 the substring k an n ( man ) nicht ( naeherum schreiben ) is analyzed in part by the rule sequence 10234  +  10241  +  1035  +  626  . The substring consists , furthermore , of a subject verb inversion characteristic of German syntax  . We may transform this construction of four rules into the corresponding English construction  ( Fig .  7 ) of three rules $33  +  466  +  28792 by writing the transformation Tz : \[10234  +  10241  +  1035  +  626\] ~ T?\ [533  +  466  +  28792\] gzeThis is equivalent to writing a transformation on the structures in Figurei O  .

The transformation brings us from tile sub ject-verb in-version of German into the normal subject-verb order for English  . Superscripts are associated with all c lass names in phrase structure rules in o rder to maintain proper order of content subst it ution during transformation from ones t ructure to another  \[13  , pp . 12 f , 51-66\] . 
TRANS LATION OUTPUT
After all translation data have been collected and compiled for a given test corpus  , the next step is to verify the data in the computer system by attempting to carry out automatic translation  . As in the case of automatic analysis , we expect translation output corresponding at least to the target language structures for which we have setup translation rules  . That is , we expect in the case of successful translation an output which resembles within satisfactory limits the human translation given as the ideal goal  . There may be , in addition , various alternative paraphrases , but the content should be essentially the same . The more likely case in the beginning stages , naturally , is partial success mixed with failure . 
Our first output for German to English translation is given in Appendix C  . The unsatisfactory quality
TOS ll 18 in this example is the result of a combination of program errors and inadequate linguistic data  . Word-for-word output would produce results quite similar to this sample  . 
Receiving such results , we referred back to the appropriate sentence diagrams and lists of translation rules to reconstruct the rules necessary for  we11-formed output . 
A subsequent run with the needed additional translation  3 rules is displayed in Appendix D . 
If we compare the computer translation ( Appendix D ) with tile human translation ( Appendix B )  , they appear quite similar at first glance , as indeed we should hope they would be . A closer inspection , however , reveals numerous differences . Some of these result from weaknesses in description as limited by the model  , while some result from the alternatives implicit in the descriptive data -- alternatives which the model is designed to cope with  . 
In the first or title paragraph , the German title is constructed in the framework of a prepositional phrase beginning with ueber  . Since the human translation was prepared without a preposition  , transformation rules were set up to delete the preposition accordingly in the computer version of the English output  . This is probably not advisable , however , since in the syntactic model there
TOStl 19 is no satisfactory way to distinguish contextually a prepositional phrase functioning as a title from its other uses  . The implication is , then , that we should reformulate our transformation for this context to produce an English preposition like on  . 
The human and machine translations are identical in the first sentence o ? paragraph I denoted by the numbers  74   001 in the left margin ( Appendices A , B , D ) . 
The German adverballe in , which is an element in the relative clause modifying the subject-noun head  , has been transformed into the English adverb only  , which now is a member of the corresponding English subject-noun head construction and not an element of the following relative clause  . For the German claused as Problem . . . so verz wei~t , we have transformed into the corresponding English clause the problem  . . . so complex , inserting a copula verb i__ss . 
Finally , in the last clause of the German sentence there is a passive construction which has been transformed into an equivalent English active construction  . There are transformations of similar complexity throughout the remainder of the corpus  . 
There is an interesting difference between the last sentence of the human translation of paragraph I and the machine translation  . In the human translation the sentence ends . . . problem of a dependence of mental processes on the bed Z  . In the machine translation the sen-

Although all the necessary grammar rules and transformations were available to the t ranslation system for producing an output identical with that of the human translation  , it is interesting that the system picked instead an alternative paraphrase  ( and a potentially confusing one ) which was more similar to the syntax of the original German input  . The system's choice was made on the basis of certain probability parameters available to it and with which we are in continual experimentation  . 
It is not surprising that the system selected such an alternative  , for we expect such to be the case in the present model  . What is interesting , however , is the fact that a choice was available even within the limited dataset which we prepared for these few paragraphs  . For this experiment the system had available to it dictionary data for the entire article of  52 paragraphs . With respect to syntactic data , however , it was quite limited since we supplied just the rules necessary to carry out analysis and/or synthesis of the six paragraphs involved in the experiment  . Furthermore , we had limited ourselves in the transformation data to a choice of one syntactic output for each sentence -- the output identical with that of the human translation  . Nonetheless , it is evident that in this small dataset there are already sufficient 
TOSIt 22 implicit relationships to permit unplanned for if not unexpected paraphrases  . 
LIMITATIONS INTHEMODEL
Paragraph 2 of Appendix D contains probably tile most f requent and characteristic examples of dev iation from an ideal output  . The paragraph contains a number of a berrant p ronominal forms  . Since German contains the form ser , es , sic and ~11 their variant case forms and since all these : forms are ultinately correlatable with all forms of English he  , she , it , it follows that we may generate any one of the English third singular pronouns from any one of the German third singular pronouns  . In the model presented hcre , we have not , for instance , classified nouns on the basis of such features as gender  , animateness , concreteness , etc . Thus , in the first sentence of paragraph 2 , we have not classified either reader or b rain as to referential gender  . Consequently , at the moment when the translation system i s prepared to generate a pronoun following the sequence  .   .   . at this moment when .   .   , t the English grammar is so constructed and tied into the transformation-transfer data that the system may generate  ( just the proper case form of ) all three third singular pronouns . Which one is generated depends on which rule has the highest probability value  , in this case the rule producing the express ionij  . t , since this is the most frequent of the pronouns in the text  . 
It is not clear that the proper choice of Eng lish pronoun gender could be specified even if we included in the syntactic descript i on such features as gender  , animate-ness , etc . For some instances of pronoun-antecedent agreement will remain ambiguous  , given two or more antecedents . 
The ambiguity occasionally cannot be resolved without resort to reference to the extralinguistic environment  . The first sentence of paragraph 2 is perhaps a case in point . Given the general context of psychology in which the test corpus was written  , it is conceivable that either the pronoun he or it could refer back to the appropriate respective antecedents reader or brain  . 
In those cases where pronoun-antecedent agreement can be stated within the linguistic environment  , we should of course be prepared to build such features as gender  , animateness , concreteness , countableness , and a host of other such features into our grammars -- features which have been difficult to account for systematically before the advent of stratificational  , tagmemic and transformational techniques . 
TOSt . !24
In the grammars we have undertaken so far for the several languages  , we have tended to exclude such features from morpho-syntactic description  . 
EXPANDING THEMODEL
We shall include features such as lexical co l-location  ( agent-action agreement ) and transformations of semantic equivalence in a systematic description of a higher o rder which presupposes a morpho-syntactic descr ip-tion for each language  \[8  , pp .  65-71 \ ]  . The following analogy might be drawn : just as strings of alphabetic and other characters are taken as a body of data to be parsed and classified by a phrase struc ture grammar  , we may re-gard the string of rule numbers generated from a phrase structure analysis as a string of symbols to be parsed and class ified in a still higher order grammar  \[11  ;  13 , pp .  67-83\] , for which there is as yet no universally accepted nomenclature  . The term transformational strongly suggests itself and is widely used  , but the term semantic 4 may seem more appropriate to others . 
TOSH 25

During the coming year we shall proceed to expand syntactic description of all languages now under investigation  . Sufficient transfer data will be com-p iled between pairs of languages to test the general validity of the model and the genera ladequacy of the system of programs we are now using  . Several questions suggest themselves with respect to limitations of the model  , among them : I . how large will the syntactic description of a language be in terms of rules before the grammar converges on the languages  , and 2 . in what ways can we improve the quality of translation by using a more soih\[sticated model  , say one in which there is a grammar of structural semantics ? We shall be occupied primarily with these two questions in an e ~ fort to anti-cipate the need for modifying elements of the translation programs and in an effort to test empirically with a comprehensive database some of the more recent theories and notions of linguistics  .

3 . On comparing the computer and human versions of the English translation with the German version  , the reader is reminded that no where are any corpus data stored explicitly in the translation system of programs  . 
Only raw corpus data in the source language are fed in as input to the analysis programs in the system  . The analysis and synthesis programs use grammatical des-criptions in both languages with attendant transfor-mation/translation rules to produce output in the target language from the analysis-transfer-synthesis cycle  . 
4 . Perhaps a passing observation is in order . The term transformational ) borrowed from mathematics ) is a term generally applicable to any process of mapping equivalences of one structure onto another and so is applicable to all levels of linguistic description  .
