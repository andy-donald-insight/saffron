How to obtain hierarchical relations ( e . g , superordinate-hyponym relation , synonym relation ) is one of the most important problems for thesaurus construction  , A pilot system for extracting these relations automatically from an ordinary Japanese language dictionary  ( Shinmeikai Koku-gojiten , published hy Sansei-do , in machine readable form ) is given . The features of the definition sentences in the dictionary  , the mechanical extraction of the hierarchical relations and the estimation of the results are discussed  . 
i . INTRODUCTION
A practical sized semantic dictionary ( thesaurus as wide sence ) is necessary for advanced natural language processing  . We have been studying how to obtain semantic information for such semantic dictionary from a Japanese language dictionary  ( Shinmeikai Kokugojiten , published by Sanseido , in machine readable form ) (1) containing about 60 , 000 entries . 
A dictionary contains meanings and usages of practical size of general words  . Especially , definition sentences DS : a brief notation are important sources of information for meanings of general words  . Generally , DS of an entr ~ word EW : a brief notation is defined by qualifying its super ~  . 
ordinate word or synonyms or hyponyms . We call these words definition M~rds DW : a brief notation  . 
We have been developing a system for extracting automatically DW related to EW from its DS  , and for deciding the DW-EW relation ( e ) . By this system , (hierarchical ) relations among entry words in the dictionary are to be established  . 
We constructed a subsystem for extracting DSs corresponding to parts of speech  , infrected form and meaning ( definition ) number of each entry word ( v )   . 
In this paper , the features of DSs in the Japanese dic-tionary , an outline of the pilot system and the resul ts of experiment will be discussed  . 
L_~EATURES_~RYJAPANE ~ ~ DICTIOBANY 2 . ~ S~TUR~DS The typical examples of DSs are as follows:  ( i )  \ [~ ( zigzag rule ) \] :  .   .   . b~o ~? ~( possible to be folded )_~ h~l ~ J . , : ( rule ) o(2)\[R~(mountain path)\]:\[ . . . # ) q  ~ D ( in ) ~i~ ( narrow path ) jO ) ~ ( then leaning of ) ~D ~ H~f ~ ( a polite expression of ) o ( 3 )  \ [~ ( blue frog ) \] :  .   .   . ~ O )   ( large )  #Anlk ( frog ) 59- -~  ( a kind of ) o ( 4 )  \ [~~ ( respectful daughter-in-low ) \] : ~\[ ( daughter-in-iow ) l = ) bt ~ ( for ) ~t ~ j  ~ ( are spectful word ) ?  ( 5 )  \ [~ ( autumn insect )  \ ] : ~ /_  ( bell-ing insect )   . 
Y~_~i-2_ ( a kind of cricke 1: ) ~ '  ( etC ) oWhere the brackets (  \ [  .   .   . \]), underline , and parentheses (( .   .   . )) denote EW , DW , and an English translation for the preceding Japanese phrase respectively  . 
In (1) , the final word is DW and superordinate-hyponym relation  ( DW > EW ) holds between the DW and the EW . 
In (2), DW is the final word in hook brackets ( r .   .   . j ) and DW > EW holds . Tile expression " r .   .   . jO ) ~6) ~$1~~" is called a functionale ~ rpr~e , ' ssionFE : a brief notation . The ( compound ) word " ~ b'J ~" in the FE is called a func-k~onA1 word ~ W : a brief notation . In this case , the FW denotes a usage of the EW . 
In (3) , DW is just before the FE "0 ) --~" and DW > EW holds . In this case , the I~E prescribes the DW > EW explic-itly . The word "-- N " is the FW . 
In (4) , DW is just before the FE"t : ~ b~?~J ~#'' and the synonymous relation  ( DW ~ EW ) holds between the DW and the EW . The FW "~" denotes a usage of the EW . 
In (5) , two DW < EW shal(t , that is , the DW"NZ'~/~/"< the EW"$~" and the DW "~" < the Ew "$~"  . In this case , the number of DNs are more than one , DW isn't modified and the FE is the word " ~*" . The FW is identi-cal with the FE .   ( Notes : " ~'" is a sub-post positive signi fying exemplification  . ) The features of DSs in the dict ionary are as follows:  ( a ) Honorary , the final ~ mrd in DS is DW . 
( b ) In some cases , the final expression in DS is YE assigning semantic relation between DW and EW  , and DW is just before the PE . 
(c ) Genraly , DW is modified by another phrase ( modifier ) . 
(d ) In some cases , DS contains more than one DW.
The following general structure is obtained according to these features  . 
'"(\[ MODIFIER\],DW )*.\[ F ~\] o
Notes )\ [ . . . \]: optional constituent ( . . . ) : required const i tuent * : sequence of coordinate constituent  ( e . g .   .   , ~ ) ?: concatination symbol which is diferent from coordinate constituent  (   . ) ~ or convenience of explanation , the general structure is divided into the following two types  . 
(I ) TYPEI : . . . (\[ MODIFIER\] . DN ) * o(I1)TYPEII : . , . (\[ MODI~\]:ER\] . DW )* . PE a expression is FE , and BW is just before the FE . 
2.2 DW-EWRELATIONINDS
We will propose the following assumptions according to abovementioned features in order to extruct the DW-EW relations from DOs of the general structure  . 
( ~) When DS is in TYPEI , DS ~ EW . Because DS is a phrase ( or a compound word ) as wides e no e . 
(~) When DS is in TYP Ell , SSpFEEW.
Where pFE is binary relation assigned by FE , and SS is the shortened DS corresponding to ( \[ MODIFIER\] , DW )* . 
?\[ MODIFIER\]?W~W (~)(\[ MODIFIERi\] . We )* ~\[ MODIFIERa\] . Wa
Where i,j : l~n , W is arbitrary word.
The following general algorithm for deciding the DN-EW relations is obtained by means of these assumptions  . 
(I ) DS is in TYPEI(DS do sn't include FE ) , ( A ) DW is modified , ( ~) The number of DW is only one , then DW > EW ( B ) The number of DW are more than one , then CD(B)DW isn't modified , ( ~) The number of DW is only one , then DW--EW ( ~ ) The number of DN are more than one , then DN < EW ( II ) DS is in TYPE II ( DS includes FE )  , ( A ) DW is modified , ( a ) The number of DW is only one , PFE is '>' or '---' , then BW > EW otherwise CO . 
( B ) The number of DW are more than one , then CD(B)DW isn't modified , ( a ) The number of DW is only one , then DW pFEEW ( B ) The number of DW are more than one , pFE is '<' , then DW < EW otherwise CD . 
CD denotes that ON-EW relation is n't extracted mechanically from DS  . In this case , the extraction of DW-BW relation needs human support at this stage  . 
2,3 FEATURES OFFE
FE prescribes hierarchical relations ( e . g . DW > EW , DW < EN , DW = EW , or DWmEW ) or whole-part relation ( DW~EW ) . ( e . g . On "\[~( interbrain )\]: . . . . ~( bra in)OD--~9 ( a part Of)o " , the FE"6D--~" prescribes DW~EW explicitly . ) Besides these relations , another relation between DW and BW are prescribed by special FEe  ( e . g . " ~ T ( under ) ") , which is called associative relation ( R ) . 
There are so many FEs that they are mainly divided into four patterns called functional patterns FP : a brief notation  . FP is expressed by means of regular expression . FP is necessary for extracting FE and DW-EW relation in forma-t_j ~_n_  ( i . e , information eccessary for deciding the DW-EW relations  ) assigned by the FE . FP also designates a place of DW in DS,
Main features of FP are as follows: ( 1 ) Type 100:\[ ,  . . DWj ? ~ ? FW (2) Type200 : . . . DW ?( ~9 . FN )* (3) Type 3OO : . . . DW ? PFW (4) Type 400: . , . DW ? e ~"( . . . )* is repitation of ( , . .),
P is special phrase ( e . g . Ic ~'~), is concatination symbol . 
We got about one hundred sevent yFWs . These are classified into two groups . In one group ( contained 64 FWs ) , the FNs contain explicitly DW-EN relation information  . In the other group ( contained 105FWs ) , some of the FWs contain usages of the EW e , which are also important to thesaurus . 
We have constructed a FN dictionary which includes FP and DW-EW relation information corresponding to the FP  . 
3 . SYSTEMFOREXTRACTING DW-EW ( HIERARCHICAL ) RELATION The system consists of the following four steps  . 
RE ~ tion of EW and DS(a ) Extraction of EW , its DS , the part of speech of the EW , the definition number of the DS from the dictionary  . 
( b ) Transformation of the extracted DS to the ordinary Japanese sentence's form  ( called the normalized DS )  . 
Because several contents ( meanings ) are thrown into one DS by means of parentheses or do t '' in the dictionary  . 
~D Extraction of FE and DW-EW rel ~ information
The FWDictionary is used.
(a ) When DS dosen't include FW , DS is in TYPEI.
(b ) When DS includes FW and conforms FP , DS is in TYPE II . 
( c ) When DS includes FW but doesn't conform FP or when DS includes more than one FW  , the DS is picked out as check data . Because it is difficult to distinguish between DW and FWor to extract DW-EW relation information mechanically  . 
(3 ) Extraction of DW and DW-HW relation informatio ~ A general word dictionary  ( containing about 75 , 000 noun words ) ( S ) is used , in which the character strings of entry words were arranged in inverse order  ( from right to left )   . 
DWs are basically extracted by means of longest matching method  , because there is ordinarily no space between two adjacent words in the Japanese sentence  . In addition to this . there are the following problems . 
( a ) The ' hiragana ' notation is often used ( e . g . ~O ) ~ b\[~b \]) . 
( b ) The names of animals and plants are described by ' katakana '  ( e . g . ~) P\[~\]) . 
(c ) The unknown ( compound ) words are often used.
( d ) In some cases , the DS containes more than one ON . 
The oxtructing procedure has to be constructed with regard to these ploblems  . 
The relation information are also extracted , that is , ' DW isn't modified ' and ' The number of DN are more than one '  . 
When DN is n't extracted ( that is , DR is neither'katakana'stringnor'kanji' string no rany entry word in the word dictionary  ) from DS , the DS is picked out as check data . 
(4) Decision of DW-EW relation
According to the conditions abovementioned , DW-EW relations are decided . 
When extracted relation information is ambiguous , DS is picked out as check data . 
PETRSUT
A pilot system has been implemented on FACOM M-360  ( Naga-saki University Computer Center ) and FACONN-382 ( Kyushu University Computer Center ) mostly by PL/I . 
The experimental input data (2 , 824 DSs ) in the first step , arc the normalized DSs . 
Table 1 shows the number of input , output and check data in each step and the number of correct and incorrect data in output data  . 
Table 2 shows the extracted DW-EW relations and the number of output data corresponding to the rela tions  . 
The experimental results are as follows : ( 1 ) The ratio of TYPEI ( 2 , 374) to output data (2 , ? ll ) is about 87 . 6% . 
(2) The ratio of TYPEI1 (337) to output data (2 , 711) is about 12 . 4% . 
(3) The ratio of output data (2 , 434) to input data (2 , 824) is about 85% . 
( a ) The ratio ( called system precision ) of correct output data ( 2 , 311) to output data (2 , 434) is about 95% . 
( b ) The ratio ( called error ratio ) of incorrect output data ( 123 ) to output data ( 2 , 434) is about 5% . 
(4) The ratio of check data (390) to input data (2 , 824) is about 14% .

The improvement of the results necessitates ( a ) analysis of the DSs ,   ( b ) reinforcement of the general word dictionary used for extracting the DWs  . 
5 ~ CONCLUDINO ~ RKK ~_ ( 1 ) The similer researches have been carried out about several English dictionarys  ( e . g . LONONAN ) (2) (~) , however there is scaresly any about Japanese dictionary  . 
(2) We have extracted automaticlly , DW < EW , DW ~ EW , DW ~ EW in addition to DW > EW as the DW-EW relations  . 
(3 ) Input data not suitable for conditions are picked out as check data in each step  . 
(4 ) There are a shortage of semantic information ( e . g . 
lack of the adequate DW ) in the dictionary because of assuming the human usage of the dictionary  . 
We have been investigating the followings.
I . Development of a system for utilizing the dictionary  ( v )   . 
II . Development of a system for hierarchically st ructuring among entry words in the dictionary  ( ~= )  . 
Ill . Development of a man-assisted system for construct ing a practical sized semantic dictionary  ( 4 )  .
