Abstract
The purpose of this contribution is to fo rmulate ways in which the homonymy of so-cal led ' Modal Particles ' and their etymons can be handled  . Our aim is to show that not only a strategy for this type of homonymy can be worked out  , but also a formalization of information beyond propositional content can be in t roduced with a view to its MT ap-plicat ion  . 
1. Introduction
During the almost 40 years of its exist-ence machine translat ion has undergone a con-siderable refinement in the fields of both syntactic parsing and semantic represent a-tion  . The development of MT can be seen as a tendency to incorporate more and more lin-guistic knowledge into \[: he formalization of t ranslational processes  . Formalization has thus become a keyword for MT and has had sev-eral major implicat ions  . Firstly , it refers to the hypothesis that everything re lated to a given language is structure d in one way or another  . Secondly , formalization is an objective mea ns of tes-ting the validity of the lingu ist's hypoth-eses about linguistic phenomena  . Thirdly , it involves the linguist's hope that any -thing that has to do with language can in fact be formalized  . 
At present , there are several semantic theories which cou ld be labelled " formal se-mantics "  . They are preoccupied with explo-ring the propositional content of different text- units and they do not deal with the phenomenon of " subjectivity "  . Subjectivity , or self-expression , as \] Lyons/1981 , 240/has pointed out , " cannot be reduced to the expression of p ropositional knowledge and be-liefs "  . If we think of MT in its ideal form , i . e . not as an abstracting device , but as a system producing automatic transla tion  , then the inadequacy of restriction to proposi-tional content wi\]l be evident ? The present paper sets out to show that the expression of lexical subjectivity  , conveyed by modal particles , should , and can , be accounted for in the process of MT . 
2. Particle Homony_my
Let us consider the following pairs of sentences : i a  . There is ~ n ~ u a little beer left . 
b . ~ was ? ~ too pleased to leave that p~ace.
2a . Nurihnhattemanvergessen.
b . Woz ~ babeich nutgelebt ? 3a . Vous part ezd dja?b . Comment vous vous appelez ddja ? 4a . ~ pu~o Cume ~ ~ a ~ usa empa . 
b . ~ u ~ leenam , ~ moc ~ as a mo.
5a . An n ~ is elj ~ n ho z z d n k ? b . Holi start ottunk ? The words underlined in the b  . example of each pair of sentences belong to a word-group now more or less uniformly refer red to as ' Modal Particles '/ cf  . Arndt 1960/ . 
These words represent , in Arndt's term , a granunatical no-man's-land , although in the past ten years there has been a considerable interest towards modal parti cles  . 

Words like the English ~ or the German nur present two problems from the point of view of machine translation  . On the one hand , they are ambiguous and their homonymy 1~/st be resolved . On the other hand , when such lexemes are used as modal particles , their " translation " causes serious problems since we can rarely translate the modal into German as nut  , or , say , into Hungarian ascsak . 
3. Resolution of Homon?my
As far as homonymy is concerned , clearly the task is to set up formal rules for the categorization of a given word as opposed to its alternative morphological and syntact ic status  . 
The implication of the assignation of such homonymous lexemes to certain classes of words is by no means a matter of " simple " selection restriction at surface level  . Each modal particle has preserved much of its etymon's syntactic and semantic properties  . 
Given this , it follows that the ambiguity may be resolved by constructing small " subgrammars " for each of these particles  , so as not only to set them apart from their homonyms  , but also to take into consideration the whole co~nunicative content of the sentence  . 
Thus , a subgrammar recognizing on l\[-either as a logical operator  , with its re-strictive meaning , or as a modal particle , with its vague and , in a sense , antonymous meaning--would have to be capable of manipulating information from different levels  . By comparing sentences/la/and/ib/it could be concluded that  , say , ~ is an operator when it precedes an NP/e . g . Det+Adj+N/and is a particle when fol lowed by too  . But this assumption can readily be proved faulty by considering  /6/:   /6/ If ~ you had come , you could have saved me a lot of trouble . 
It is commonly held that , in order to parse sentences , one needs strategies for locating verbs and their complements  , assign-6Oing words to various categories , depending on context/Lehrberger 1982 ,  102/ . The rec-ognition of particles can be done mainly by starting from semantic represent at ions which should contain information concerning both the propositional content of sentences and their extra propositional  , or subjective modal content . Thus , assigning ~ topar-ticles would imply an algor ithm roughly de-fined as : " If the lexeme ~ is used with a word that has no restrictive component in its meaning  , then it is a particle ; otherwise it is an operator " . 
Parsing along these lines would mean a very complicated presentation of different parts of speech  , including not only NPs , made up of adjectives , nouns , but also adverbs , pronouns and even phrases to account for ~ n ~ constructions like  /6/  . In addition , a very sophisticated and precise definition of the restriction/non-restrict i on opposi-tion would have to be setup  . 
Obviously , the difficulty of assigning homonymous lexemes to modal particles  , on the one hand , and to operators , intensifiers , adverbs , conjunctions , and the like , on the other , lies in the fact that the former bear are lat ionship to the overall meaning of the sentence  , while the latter add their meaning to the global meaning only via some lower level of semantic structure  . 
From the above consideration it follows that it would be a fairly tedious and probably unreasonable task to attempt to resolve this kind of homonymy by the algorithmiza-tion of abstract sense-components  . 
Instead , it might be sufficient to construct a subgran ~artocheck ~ and other homonyms solely by reason of their being a particle  . One way to make the information contained in the subgrammar available to the parser may be to indicate  , in the dictionary entry of the homonym , all the cases in which the given word could poss ibly appear as a particle  . 
In English , or French , the resolution of ambiguity would mean setting up as few as  610 subgrammars , while in German , Russian or Hungarian there are scores of homonymous particles and  , consequently , subgrammars . In addition , the latter languages make quite frequent use of particle combinations which do not  , as a rule , derive their meanings from a complement of the two/or more/particles  , but have some different meaning , cf . 
/ 7/ Csakhemfdzt dlmeg ? /8/ Y x ~ enpocmy Cunc ~ num ~ ? Nevertheless , there seems to be no reason why these combinat ions could not be included in the subgrammar under one or the other dic-tionary entry  . 
4. Translation of Modal Particles
Whilst intensifiers , conjunctions , operators , pronouns , or adverbs have meanings which may be considered more or less " universal "  , the semantics of particles takes us into a fie ld specific to a particular language  . In other words , using ~ as an operator is " almost " identical to using  , say , nur ~ or seulment , or csah etc . as an Operator in German , French or Hungarian respectively . But when it comes to particles , we may experience difficulties in preser v ing the operator equivalent of onl ~ in the translation of sentences like/ib/into any other language  . 
One possible solution , as with lots of different types of translat ion  , would simply be to consider these words irre levant from the point of view of proposit ional content matching  . However , it would seem more plaus-ible to try to find equivalents to these par-ticles in the target language since  , depending on the type of context to be translated  , the expression of subjectivity may play a major role in producing the actual co~nuni -cative message  . 
Functional equivalence is a notion frequently used in linguistic theory/Arnol'd  1976  ; Sanders 1980/ , and it can be applied as a yardstick in partic le matching/Fig  . i / . 
A study of modal particle translation is now being undertaken in Szeged University's Eng-l ish-Hungarian MT project and it is based on functional equivalence  . 
Those researchers who study MT in re-stricted semantic domains might overlook the problem of the subjectivity of the different texts  . It should be noted , however , that " most of the unexpected structures one finds in a sublanguage text can be associated not so much with a shift in semantic domain as with a shift/usually quite temporary/in the atti tude which the text producer takes towards his domain of discourse "/ Kittredge  1982  ,  135/ . But even with academic papers it happens to be the case that during their translation one should be aware of the appearance of some subject iveover-tone lest some mistranslation should ensue  . 
In this respect , consider the following two examples with on/\] / as a particle:  /9/ Onl ? too often have far-reaching conclusions been drawn from inadequate data collected from a limited number of languages  . /Ullmann : Semantic Universals , 1966, p .  218/ /\] . 0/Similarly , it is ~ nl ~_ natural that verbs for " snoring " should in many languages contain an / r /  . . . / Op . cit .
