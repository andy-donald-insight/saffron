Timpa per demonstrates tim problem of
translating modal verbs and phrases and shows how some of these problems can be overcome by choosing semantic representations which look like representations of passive verbs  . 
These semantic representations suit alternative ways of expressing modality by e  . g . passive constructions , adverbs and impersonal constructions in the target language  . Various restructuring rules for English , Swe(lish and
Russian ampresented.

Modal verbs belong to the , nest frequent
English words . Clauses with modal expressions make up a considerable part of the clauses of any text  , why any MT system which is claimed to cover empirical texts with reasonable quality must include solutions to the problems discussed in this paper  ( cf . An et al 1993 for a corpus based approach ) . One of the problems connected with the analysis of such clauses is the fact that the distinction between auxiliaries and medals is not clear  . Verbs like ought to and d are ( to ) are often labelled semi-auxiliaries , begin and continue are called aspectual verbs etc  . A common denominator fauxiliaries , semi-auxiliaries , medals and several perception verbs is their " auxiliary meaning " including tense  , modality and aspectual perspective ( of . Gawrofiska , 1993) . In the following , the term " auxiliary " will be used even when referring to verbs traditionally called medals and perception verbs  . 
The typical " auxiliary " meanings , e.g.
modality , aspectual perspective and tenses how great encoding variation between languages  . 
And even within one language one may often choose between several different lexical-grammatical modes  . In English one may choose between X may come , It is possible that X comes , and X possibly comes with only minor stylistic differences  . 
Swedish kan has both a root meaning ( equivalento is able to ) and an epist cmic meaning ( equivalent to may )  , while English can only has the first meaning . The mode of encoding auxiliary meanings may be even more differentiated in other languages  . Thus , He must come , has to be rendered by the passive construction II est obligd devenir or the impersonal constructionll fimt qu ' il vienne in French  . In Russian one would have had to render this sentence using an an adjective  ( dol Zen ) or an adverb ( nado , ne obxodimo ) . 
Japanese would have to use konake rebanarimasen ( literally : " I two n't do if X does not come " )  . MT-systems dealing with a certain pair of languages may tailor the meaning representations of auxiliaries ad hoc  , but multilanguage system such as Swelra , the Swedish Computer Translation Project ( Sigu , ' d &
Gawrohska ,  1990) , must choose more universal representations and suitable restruct-uring transfe  , " rules its will be demonstrated . 
T i m p , ' oblem of modality is also of general interest for linguistic  , semantic and cognitive theo , ' y ( Sweetser ,  1990) . 
English Verb Phrases
There are two basic types of verb phrases in English  ( el Sigurd ,  1992) , one ( 1 ) consisting only of a finite main verb ( with possible complements )  , e . g . Bill jumps , the other ( 2 ) consisting of a finite auxiliary verb followed by a nonfinite main verb  ( with possible complements )  , e . g . Bill must . j t m T p . The nonfinite main verb in the second type may be in the infinitive without o as illustrated  , or in an infinitive with to as in Bill be ganre jump  . The nonfinite verb may also be a past participle as in Bill has  . fltml ) edora present participle as in Bill began . jtt , ll ) ing . The choice between on-finite forms is an automatic consequence of the preceding verb  . We note that the have meaning perfect lense takes the perfect participle as in Bill has juml  ) ed , while the have which is an equivalent of must takes the infinitive with to as in Bill has to  . iump . The verb begin may take an infinilive with to ( Billbeganto . j m np ) or alternatively a present participle ( Bill be ganjttmping )  . The auxiliaries in other languages , e . g . German and Swedish display similar combinatorial properties  . 
The second type o1' verb phrase mentioned may be expanded to include further nonfinite auxiliaries  , as illust , ' ated in : Bill must . ~ Bill must d are to hegint () . jumj2imdBillre,st&tr?tohe ? into be able to . jmni ~ Occasionally there may be a short adverb between the nonfinite forms as in Bill must must d are to not jt tmp  , although the socalled split infinitive construction is condemned by prescriptive grammarians  . 
Semantic Representations o1'V erb

The meaning complexes corresponding to the verb phrases described may simply be rendered as lists of the constituent verb meanings  , where the tense of the finite verb is shown , but the particular form of nonfinite verbs and tim occurrence or nonoccurrence of infinitive markers are not shown  . This is the approach taken by Swetra . The lexical meaning representations or semantic markers in Swetratire of the form re  ( S , G ) , where m denotes meaning , S is the main meaning of the word denoted by a kind of MachincseEnglish and G the grammatical meaning  . The verb form jumps has the , ' e presentation m(i , mp , pres ) . 
The rnearfings of the infinitive form ( to ) . jump , the past participle jumped and the present participlc jttml  ) ing are ; ill rendered as re(jump , nonf ) . The following table shows some preliminary meaning representations of verb phrases under the phrases  .

The order chosen is arbitrary . We have illustrated tim representation of a passive phrase was painted as well  . This representation is also used for the Swedish morphological passive which is mr ~ tlades  ( there is also a syntactic passive in Swedish : b h  , v . , glad ) . 
Passive Meaning Representations l ' or some Auxil iaries Linguists have often talked about he meanings of auxiliaries using words and concepts uchas : compulsion  , obligation , permission , ability , necessity , prohahility and possibility . 
Words which can be associated with compulsion and obligation  , e . g . muvt , s'hallought to have been called deontic . Ad~stmctmn between a root me , ' ming and an epist cmic in casing has been observed for a number of auxiliaries  , e . g . must , where the two meanings are illustrated by the following two examples  ( from Swectser ,  1990 , p ,  49) . 
Bill must be home by ten ; Mother won'tlethim stayout any longer Bill must be home already  ; I seeh & coat The epistemic meaning may also be rendered by sentence adverbials as illustrated by : Bill is evidently Z s'eemingly home or an impersonal expression with an adjective as in It is clem ? obvious that Bill is home  . It would be an advantage if the semantic representations of auxiliaries could bE related in a simple way to the meaning representations of such equivalent :  . ld verbs and adjectives . 
The simplest way to represent the meanings of auxiliaries is illustrated by re  ( can , pres ) . It is then logical to choose m(ccm , nonf ) fo , " the assumed infinitive be able to . Similarly , one may represent the meaning of present mttst by m  (  , m . ~' t , pres ) and and the meaning of tim corresponding infinitive be obliged to by m  ( mttst , non . f ) . The phrase be obliged to can , however , also be regarded as a passive in which case it would be represented as : Ira  ( oblige , non . \['), re(passive , nonf)\] . With this representation imin done may represent present must as/re  ( oblige , nonf ) , re(passive , pres )\] insteadimd can as Ira(able , non\]) , re(passive , pres ) \] which directly gives us the synonym is able to . 
ThErearel ' urth cr semantic arguments in favour of representing constn~ctions with modal verbs in a wlty similar to passive clauses  . The referent of the subject in a sentEncE with a modal verb is not as " agentivc " as the referent of the suhjcct of a typical active content verb  . 
If the term agent is to be understood ; is the clement of timevent-situation that is actively involved in and responsible for tim triggering of tim Event-situation i question  ( Oawrofiska 1993 )  , it becomes clear that the subject of a modal construction is not a typical agent  . Its responsibility lkn " triggering the event -situation is reduced by the obligation  , allowance or compulsion component . In Russian and Polish , tiffs property of tim subject referent is overtly expressed by the dative case in several modal construction  . The equivalent of the English or Swedish ! subject in Russian sent EnCes with nado  ( ' it is obligatory ' )  , not allowed ' ) or Polish wolno ( ' it is allowed ' ) occurs in the dative , a case normally associated with the semantic roles ' beneficiary ' or ' experiencer '  . 
Passive representations of some
English auxiliaries
One may hesit a tew benchoosing terms in tile meaning representation sais obvious fi'om works on modals  . The following ark used by

/* allowance*/elex(\[m(allow , nonO , m(passive , pres )\] , v , aux , f in ,  _ ,  1 , inf , i , \[I)-->\[may\] . 
The semantic representation/re ( allow , no 11/') , re(passive , pres ) \] of file finite form may makes it comparable to the meaning rep  , ' esentations of is ~ was allowed ~ permittedo and the infinitive be allowed/permitted to  . This meaning may be illustrated by Bill may come ( as heasked )  . The form may may have another ( epistemic ) meaning as well ( below )  . 
/* obligation */ elex(\[m(oblige , nonl ) , re(passive , pres )\] , v , aux , f in ,  _ ,  1 , inf , i , \[\]) -->\[ must l . 
The representation lm(oblige , nonf ) , re(passive , pres ) \] gives is obliged to as a synonym as is generally suggested in grammars  . 
/* capability */ elex(\[m(able , nonf ) , re(passive , pres )\] , v , aux , f in ,  _ ,  1 , inf , i , \[\]) -->\[ can\] . 
This representation makes it possible to get is able was a direct synonym and tile infinitive be able to which is desirable  . 
/* epistemic appea , ' ancc*/elex(lm(perceive , non 0 , re(passive , pres )\] , v , aux , f in , agr(pl .   .   .   . ), 1, to inf , i , It ) -->\ [ seem I . 
This analysis makes the phrase Bill is perceived to come parallel to Bill seems to come  , which is reasonable , although the first phrase seems to he too specific and implies a latent agent  . This epistemic meaning is also expressed by grammarians by such words as : inference  , conclusion . 
There is a number of cpistemic expressions which indicate the sense modality of the perception more or less clearly as illustrated by : Bill is said ~ heard/felt to come  . 
/* epistemic possibility , probability , certainty elex(\[m(possible , nonl ) , m(passive , pres )\] , v , aux , f in ,  _ ,  1 , inf , i , \[\]) -->\[ may \] . 
elex(\[m(pm bable , non 0 , re(passive , pres )\] , v , aux , f in ,  _ , l , to inf , i , \[\]) -->\[ ought\] . 
elex(\[m(certain , nonl ) , m(passive , pres )\] , v , aux , f in ,  _ ,  1 , inf , i , \[\]) -->\[ shall\] . 
The semantic representations of auxiliaries must be sensitive to tim presence/absence of negation  . The equivalent of English mzgst , when not negated , is the etymologically related Swedish verb mc ~ ste  , whereas must not is not to be rendered by m ( )ste inte ( ' must'not )  , but by fi ~ rinte('is not allowed to ') . The need for attention to negation becomes even more conspicuous when considering tile effects of the interplay between egation and aspect in translation between Russian and English  ( cf . 
Isa~enko 1962:I98): a . nad overnut'k nigu'must'relurn-perf book-ace ' one has to return the book/lbe book must be returned ' b  . nadovozvra , ~at'knigi'must'return-imp books-nom/acc' one ought to return books ' c  . nena do vozvrag ~: at ' dtukniguneg ' must ' return-imptiffs book-ace'one does not need /have to return tills book ' Tile problem of translation between English and Russian can be solved by lexically encoded negation and aspect control  , according to patterns like the following : elex ( lm ( oblige , nonl ) , re(passive , pros )\] , v , aux , f in ,  _ ,  1 , inf , i , 1711) -->\[ must\] . 
r lex(\[m(oblige , nonl) . m(passive , pres ) l , adv , rood , inf , \[ perfl ,  1  .   .   .   .   . \[I)-->Inadc,l . 
The Russi , ' ullexical entry ( r lex ) contains the information that an English modal verb with the meaning codem  ( obligue , nonf ) , re(passive , pres ) is to be rendered by the Russian modal adverb nado  , provided that nado is not negated and that it is combined with a perfective infinitive clause\[ perf\]  . 
Negation would have shown in the slot now marked\ [ perfl  . This pattern covers cases exemplified by a . The other patterns are handled in an analogous way  .

It is evident from the analysis above that there is a number of auxiliaries which can be translated directly as a consequence of the semantic representations suggested  .

It will then have to make changes in the functional representation admove parts of the meaning representations  . The following is a general Prolog rule , which moves the epistemic meaning from the predicate to the adverb  . The rule assumes the analysis of auxiliaries presented above and suitable lexical representations  . The rule states that if there is a structure such as A  , there is also B . 
instruct(A,B ) :-
A =\[ pred(\[m(X , non0\] , \[m ( E pist ,  _)\] , m(passive , T ) II ) , advl(\[\])\] , % N may come

In translation from and into Russian , there is a need for rendering an impersonal construction  , like nad over nut'knig , , into an English or Swedish construction with an overtly realized subject  ( E . The book must be returned , S .

In such cases , tile ' restruct ' rules move the representation f the Russian object into the subjecl slot of the target representation adinstantiale the mode variable in the constant ' passive '  . The definite-he SS value of the subject is assumed to be  , by default , + definite , which generally holds for perfective constructions with singular objects and preverbal subjects  .

Such rules may be used as transfer rules in MT systems  . They may also be used in oMer to derive synonynlous expressions in the same hmguage  . Some subtle semantic and stylistic differences between the target and the source sentences ometimes occur  . However , the translations are generally comprehensible .
