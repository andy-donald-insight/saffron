It is possible to manipulate real-size human -oriented dictionaries on a Macin tosh by using only very simple tools  . Our methodology has been applied in the construction of al : rench-Fnglish-Malay dictionary  . This dictionary has been obtained by " crossing "   . ~ mi-aulomatically two bilingual dictionaries .

In collaboration with Univ crsity Sains Malaysia ( USM )  , we are working on a French-F . nglish-Malay human-oriented dictionary ( F'EM project ) obtained by " crossing " French-lhiglish and lh~glish-Malay dictionaries  . 
Taking into account here luclanee of lexicograph crs to revise dictionaries through database interfaces  ( dBASElIl-"~"or 41 ) TM )  , we have developed a meth ( ?lology based on using only very simple lools . For editing , we use Word and its styling facility , because no editor of slructure document is available on the Macinlosh  . For i in l~oriing and exporting , we use I/l ' , a simple specialized langulige for writing transcriptors  , and transfonn between representations ( normalized ASCII , ITF , etc . ) . Finally , we have developed ALEX , a dictionary tool , io support the electronic form . The methods defined have been applied on the FEM dictionary  . They concern I he correction of errors which can : lppears in a manually buill dictionary and the formatting  o1" this diclion a , y . 
We inlm duee first in more dot , ills lira situation we face with the FEM project . We expose the goals we tend to reach . Then we gives our generic methods and their applications to the specific case of the I:EM dictionary  . 
I . Situation 1. Presentation
The FFM dictionary is composed of two pa , ts : a general one (12 , 000 entries ) and a specific one for computer-science tenniuology  ( 2 , 300 Icnns ) . Both paper and elcctmnic forms will be iuodnced by  mid-94  . 
We have initially received ASCII files obtained firslly by oplieal characters recognition and corrected manually in which the informalions of the French-Faiglish and lnglish-Malay dictionaries have been crossed  . 
2. Logical form
The printed form of dictionaries rellect their internal structure  ( Boguraev 1990 , Byrd , Calzolari , Chodomw & al .  1987) . This slruc in recanlie modeliz cd wilh a logical \ [' el ' Ill whi di gives the sequence of the informations conlained by the dictionary  . This logical feral contains entries , prononciation p : irls , spelling wu ' ia nls , grammatical categories , sonian lics informalion , silb-enlries , elc . We have defined a logical form of the arlielo in IheFIM dicfion : uy  ( fig .  1) .

II . Goals
We pursue four goals in this project . Theya , clisted
Ix : low in order of importance.
1. Paper formatting
Our first aim is to produce from the ASCII normalized form a paper form of the FI'M dictionary with a format approaching that of usual dictionaries  ( fig .  3) . This involves the introduction in d~e format of fonts  , styles , etc .

Fig . 3: an entry of the pul~lishal ~ lepaper FF , Mdictionary2 . Electronic formatting We also produce an electrcmic form  . This electronic dictioua , y is supported by of a generic mullilingual diction a  , ' ytc~l , ALEX . The problem is to keep as much : isix ~ ssible of the logical loru L so as to allow logical access such as searching on multiple keys  , sorting , etc . 
3 . Dictionary revision " Crossing " of the French -Euglish and English-Malay dictionaries has been made manually by people who were not lluentill French  . Thus , some errors remaiu in both the logical structure and in the content  . These errors have 1o Ix : corrected before producing lhefinal paper form of the 
FEM dictionary.
4. Phonetic codes conversion
USM did not use the standard phonetic transcriptic m  ( international phonetic alphabet-IPA )  , lint a local transcription using certain ch'u ' , ' lcters of IheTilnesTM font , which looks like characters of the IPA . These characters have high ASCII code ( 128 to 256 )  , thus this rendering is different according to the Ibm  . To be portable to PC for instauce , the files must contain only lower ASCII characters  ( 32 to 128 )  . 
I ! 1. Methodology
Our methodology is genetic enough to be applied to other projects dealing with the construction of real-size publishable human-oriented dict ionaries  . The methodology is based on the use of simple but power full ~ ls  . 
1 . Use of an editor for correcting errors The problem is to find an appropriale software for this work  . The first type of software is databases but our experiences with them  ( we have used dBASEIII and all ) ) show that lexicographers don't like to work through Data Base Management Systems  . They want to use the same word processor tc~see the texts they want to index and to construct the dictionary  . 
The most practical tool would b canedilor of structured documents like Grif  ( Andr 6 , Furuta & Quint 1989 , Phan & Boiler 1992 ) which can manage the logical form of tile dictionary  , l lowever , such editors are complex Io learn and are not yet availal  ) leon microsas I heyrequirelm gecomputing ressources  . \]Ience , we use Word , awklely awlilable com , ncrcial word processor . 
We approach this not km of structure documents by using Word's " styling " facility  . A Word style is a group of paragraph and characters format with a name  ( e . g . tile title of this section has the style ' Tit lel'which include stile information about the rendering of this lille  )  . We associate a particul : lr style to each logical type  o1" infer , harlem in the dictionary .

Use of an SLLP for converting formats To convert the initial norm : flizcdASCII externalfcmn  ( fig . 2) illaprintable form ( llg .  3) , we propose some solutions : Unfortunately , that facility is euly available on the PC version  , and welmmd it very clums y to constantly exchange large files bct w cen the PC and the Mac into sh  , not speaking of unexpected chant cter

We used I:l"(l;mgtmge of Transcriptions ) , a Specialized l . anguage for l , inguistic Programmi Llg for wrilting trall scriplors  . 
LT transducers have one input tape with two reading heads  ( one standard head and one forward head ) and one writing head . They can also handle wuiables and produce side effects  . Thus , this kind of transeriptors is not reversible in general  .

We have lhus defined three form . ' t ts . Ph : l is the initial fo , m of the Word files in a standard mac into sh font ( files built at IJSM )  .   Ph2 is the format where special characters are replaced by others which appear in qllusual fonts  ( characters corresponding with tile letters , the numbers and with the '+' , '-' signs , i . e . 7-bits ASCII ) . This ASCII coding authorises as a feex change between Macintoshes and P  ( 's .

Its functionalities , are quite classical ( inserting and deleting items , sorting , searching ) . The interesting features are timpossibility to index a base on several keys and to search according to these keys or tile content of any non-indexed entry  ( although it is slower )  . 
Enu'ies can be structured objects and se , ' u'chcsanbed one in function of the values of the features  . Astone base can handle heterogeneous objects .

The methodology for manipulating human-oriented dictionaries presented in this paper is based on simple bat powerful tools which can be used by lexicographers who don't want to spend much dine learning how to use structured doemnents editors and even less  , how to progr , ' urt in I ) BMS . We use Word , a commercial word processor ; LT , a language of transcriptions ; ALF . X , a diction , ' uy tool . Contrary to our initial fears , these simple tools proved very convenient , and powerft , lenough for the tasks at h , 'md .
