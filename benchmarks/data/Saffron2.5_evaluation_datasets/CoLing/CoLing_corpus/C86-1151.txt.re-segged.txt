The fo\]lo wine article presents a proto type : for the mach : ine translation of Eng lish into French  . The study was carried out over a period of n inemonths  , fol:low in ? a six months preliminarys tudy  , under contract with tile Burroughs Company and using a mi-cro-comnuter of tile  B20 series . 
The prototype aims to provide ad\]apnosti c study that lays the foundations for fur ther development rather than immediately n rodu-cing an accurate but limited real is a tion  . 
By way of exneriment , the corpus : For translat : ion was based on se lected extracts : From computer systems manua ls  . After study in , the basic materia \] , as well as assess dn . ~ the var Jous decis:ion criteria , : it was decided to construct a prototype made tm of three components : analysis  , transfer and generation . 
Although the prototype was desimmd with mui tJ\]ingua\]  , an p\]i cat \] ons : in mind , it am~ea-red preferable atth : is stage not to set una system wilh interlinp : ua since tile e:labora-?lion of the:in terlinyua alone would have ta-ken unad is nronortionate amount of time  ( King , Perschke ,  1984) , thus h and J cap ~ J np the development of the nrototy ne itself  .

2.2. Mornholooical analysis
As then rototy new as being , real ~ sed based on and for a limited corral s  , the SL dictionary was made unof comnlete fo rms : the working out of amornhological narser is simpler than that of a syntactic a lnarser  . 
2.3. Syntactical anal vs is
The Aup-mented Transition Network ( ATN ) was selected for the ana \] ys is : it had successfully been used in many n revious systems : I  , UNAi ~ , SH ! ~ DLII , \] INTEI , I , \] iC , T and , more recently , ENFISPAN ( Leon ,  1984) . T . ~' ~\] no ~ radn resents three networks in great detail in his boo\]<'  Lan~ua9e as a Cognitive Process ' ( Winograd ,  1983) . These were taken as the basis for the four ( Sentence , Noun Phrase , Prenositio-nalPhrase and Adjectival Phrase ) of the nro-toty De , thus makin ~ it nossible to sneed un the develonment of an arser which had alrea-dynroved itself in other resnects  . 
The majority of the modifications made to the \] ~ rino ~ rad'sATN were aimed at increas in ~ its nerformance  ( esnecia \] lybvdealin ~ with the most common cases of coordination  ) as well as its determinist canacities therebyen suring  , the accuracy of the initial analy-sis sunnlied by the system  ( it : is ill fact on this analysis that the transfer operates be-cause the micro- comnuter's memory was satura-sible analysis  )  . 
2.4. Disambiguation
Within the prototype framework , the creation of a disambiguation subcomponent would have taken up too much time and would not have be-en useful particularly that this research is deliberately designed to apply to only a limited corpus in which most of the ambiguities concern the Prepositional Phrase attachment and need not be solved for the translation if English into French  . 
2.5. Source-Language dictionary
For the various reasons explained above , the dictionary includes only complete forms . 
All variable words are characterised by different syntactical : features  , certain of which concern their form , others do not . 
All of these are treated by the analysis component  . Semantic features could easily be added at a later stage  . 
Words forming certain ' tradition a\]' classes may belong to various categories of the ~ ro-to type dictionary  . This is notably the case with cardinal adjectives  , which are at once classified as determiners and substantives  . 
At present , the only compounds that the prototype dictionary accepts are locutions with a maximum of two consecutive words  . Longerlocutions , compound verbs and other discontinuous compounds ~ quiter are in the corpus  , will be treated as follows at a later sta~e : all words liable to appear in compounds will be tagged with a no interto this effect  , to enable the preprocessing sub-comnonent to determine whether a compound or simple form is present in a given text  . 
Numbers were not introduced into the prototy-pe dictionary  . The parser would accent them if a routine were created that would automa-tically attribute noun and determiner categories to them  . 
3." Transfer " component
The transfer component deals with the results obtained by the analysis component  . 
3.1. Structural transfer
By dealing < with the structural transfer first , one is saved , notably , from having to waste time translating forms that will duly be dropped  ( such as ' will ' )  , since the adaptation to tense in French is done along with the structural transfer  . 
The structural transfer operates on the sentence as a whole  , on various levels . It only saves those results of the analysis that are pertinent for the generation  . 
3.1.1. Sentence
The various constituent elements of the clau -lowing seauence :  ( Passive )  +  ( Negative ) + Role+NPl + Auxi-liaries + Verb + ( NP 2 )  +  ( NP3 ) + PPNPI is the deep subject of the clause , NP2 is the direct'object ( the attribute or even noth in ~ at all if the main verb is of the ' be ' type  ) and NP3 is the indirect object . 
All nass\]ve clauses are out into the active voice durl nv the analysis and structural transfer  . These are the transformations that , where necessary , regain the passive voice in the process of generation into 

3.1.2. Noun Phrase
Three rewrites are possible for the noun phrase : - Number + Pronoun-DNP  ( ' dummy NP ' ) - Number + (   ( Determiner ) + Noun + ( Adjective )  +  ( Noun )  +  ( PP )  +  ( S )   ) The rewrite elements are derived from various registers of the analysis result  . 
3.1.3. Verb Phrase
By Verb Phrase is understood here the Auxi-liary together with the Main Verb  . This involves ' Auxiliary ' in its widest sense , that is comprising all that precedes the verb : tcnse  ( present , infinitive and/or imperfect ) , modality and even person . It should be no-ted that only third person forms appear in the corpus studied  . 
The verb phrase rewrites itself extensively in the following manner :  ( Infinitive ) + Present/Imperfect+3rd . n + ( Avoir/Etre+Past Participle )  +  ( Modal )  +  ( Avoir/Etre+Past Participle ) + Verb To arrive at this rewrite , many rules that combine together are brought into play for various reasons concerning  , notably , the multiple feature categories , the treatment of ' be ' , ' dummy be ' and . ' dummy modal ' . 
3.2. Transfer dictionary
In En~l\]s has in other languages , a word may belon ~ to several grammatical categories  ( ' all ' is at once adverb , determiner and pronoun ) or , indeed , the same form may have various dimensions ( ' read'has the features of infinitive , present ( except for the 3rd person in the singular )  , and past as well as past participle ) . Besides , one word in English may have several possible translations in French  . For these reasons , it seemed convenient to create a transfer dict ionary situated in between source and target language dictionaries in order to avoid excessive mul-tiplication of relationships and also to fa-cilitate the extension of the system too-ther language pairs  . 
Unlike the English terms which are in the dict ionary in a complete form  , their French translations are presented in canonical form  . 
3.3. Lexical transfer
Lexical transfer operates directly afte r the structural transfer  . At the moment , it is always the first translation ( when there are several possibilities ) that is chosen . 
One could envisage adapting various means of selecting the best translation  , ranging from the human operator to the style index  . 
4." Generation " component
The generation or synthesis takes place in two stages : the syntactical generation is fol lowed by the morphological generation  . 
Both of these stages refer to data : from the target-language dictionary as well as f rom the common data pool  . 
The generation in French is inspired by the rules of  ( : homskian generative and transforma-tional grammar  , specifically as presented in the work of C  . Nique ( Nique , 1978) . 
Most of the other grammatical theories cur- rently invogue  ( Montagov \] an Grammar , Genera-lized Phrase Structure Grammar ,   .   .   .   ) make wi-de use of semantics and thus necess itate Far more powerful computer resources than those available on micro-computers at present  . 
4.1. Target-Language dictionary
In the target-language dictionary , the diffe-rent : features allowing : for the agreement of the canonical : forms must be added to the va-rious grammatical categories  . 
A common data pool is associated with this dict ionary  . This enables one to conjugate the verbs correct ly  ( root table and conjugation table )  , lit also contains the different forms of the determiners and their conditi-ons of usage  . 
4.2. Syntactical Generation
The generation is carried out by means of transformations  . Below are presented those transformations that have a fundamental role in the elaboration of the structure of the sentence in French and in the ordering of its terms  . Others directly concern the mor-phologyo f the words  , and are outlined brief-ly later on . 
In accordance with the theory of generative and transformational grammar  , transformati-ons occur in an orderly manner in an ascen-ding cycle  , that is to say : from the inside , outwards , starting with the most subordinate c lauses  . 
Passive Transformation : e . g . : The entire field of booleans can bet reated-active deep structure-Le champ entier de  boo16ens peut 8tre   trait6  . 
Transformation of Negation : e . ~ . : Each name is an identifier which cannot be a\ ] located--positive dee ~ structure - Chaoue nome stun\]dent:ifieurqu\]ne peut pas ~ treal  lou6   . 
Transformation of Subordination , which correctly : inserts the subordinate clauses : e  . g . : Each bit may be used to store a logical value - Chaque \]  ) it ~ eut@treem ploy 6 pour m ( morise run evaleur lo ~ . ique . 
Auxiliary Transformation : - if , in the rewrite of the verbal nhrase , Avoir/gtreoccur , the apDronr Jate auxiliary is chosen denending on the feature specified : in the tareet-langua ~ edictionary  . 
Transformation Movement of the Adverb : e . g . : A virtual field item always occupies an : integral number of  4-bit di ? its oUn arti-clev:irtue \] du cham ~ occunetou jours unnora-breentier de chiffres deau atre hits  . 
4.3. ~ or nholoqica \] ~ enerat:ion
The mornholoyical generation : is made up of the following trans:formations : subjec t-verb a ~  , reement , conjugation , nounoualifier ( which inserts ' dele ' between a noun and it scom-olement  )   , insertion of determiner , nouna- , reement , determiner agreement , adject : ive agreement , placement of adjective , elision and contract : ion . 
5. Conclusion
The resuJts obtained over a relatively br iefneriod by a team of two researchers may he considered as encouragin ~ and tend to be o~t imistic as to the : future o : f machine t rans-lation or machine-aided translat io nonsmall systems  .
