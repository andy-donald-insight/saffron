This paper describes the framework for a new abstraction method that utilizes event-tmits written in sentences  . Event-units are expressed in Language Information Struct nrc  ( LIS ) form and the projection of LIS from a sentence is f  ) cf fonned by a semantic engine . ABEX ( ABstraction EX-traction system ) utilizes the LIS outptt t of the semantice ng in e  . ABI ' ; X can extract events from sentences and classify them  . Since ABEX and the LIS formns conly limited knowledge  , the system need not constructor nlaintain a large amount of knowledge  . 
1 Introduction
Automatic abstraction , alnajor naturalauguagc\]n'uecss-ing application  , is difficult to achieve .   Luhn\[5\] developed a very simple extraction method that searches for the keywords ill each sentence  . This typenf abstraction is easy to accomplish , but its quality is poor . Other abstraction methods\[6 , 31 utilize natural anguage unders ~ ding ( NLU) . However NLU is still in the development sage . 
For achieving ood practical performance , it is necessary to treat the th formation expressed in at locument uniformly so that it can be analyzed with only a small fixed amount of knowledge  . 
We propose tile L . IS form which allows inlormatinn about events tO Lvduni lollnly treated  , t;urt\[lcl~nore , the semant E engine only uses abstract words , this reduces thcsize of the knowledge . So the semuntic engine projects a sentence to a LIS form within alm dtedanloant of knowledge  . 
In abstraction , classification is the first step . Classification is performed using unilor ln approach  , the LIS lkmn . 
LIS event representation ullow us to select and classify sentences  , 2 A semantic engine 2 . 1 What is the l , anguage Information
Strncture ( LIS ) form ?
The LIS form expresses the inlormation structure that pernlits commnnication between individuals  . If two inodividuals communicate about one that happened  ( will happen ) m the real world , the core inlormation is the event . Some tm~esape , a ker will atul chean attitude to the event . So informational ~ ml realworld is expressed by the event and the attitude of tilespeaker  . 
2.2 L1S form
In the LIS form , there are two types of feature-structure , word feature-strncture and event feature -structure  . Almost all slots of tile word feature-st xucture are filled with appropriate values and lew slots of the event feature-structure are empty  . The semantic engine tries to fill all slots of lhe feature-structure  . 
2.2.1 Event feuture-structure
Even thas one leature-structure , the role lkkq ture . The sentence conlilins one or more events and die event feature-structure indicates the role of words or phrases in the event  . The role feature is either essential or extensional  . 
Seven essential roles have been created : as AGENT  , OBJECT , ACTION , LOCATION , TIME , FROM , and TO . 
These roles are defined not for verbs but for events  . This is quite diflerent li'om Fillmore's cases \[2\]  . Therefore , the action ill the event is represented by the ACTION slot  , which c ~ ln be lilled by verbs , nouns , gerunds , and so oil . 
It is not necessary to fill the ACTION slot by a verb  . 
l : or exuln ple , tile phra . sc " alaudtmr chase agreement " is dealt with as one event in the LIS  , and the ACTION slot-value is " agreement " . Other slots , such as AGENT , OBJECT , LOCAI'ION , TIME , FROM and TO slots are ahoos the same as in Fillmore's cases of ' agent '  , ' object ' , ' location ' , ' time ' , ' source ' , and ' goal ( or experiencer ) ' . 
It is important that our role model deals with the roles of words  ( or pltrases ) in an event , not word meaning . 
Using just seven essential roles , it is difficult to assign at alc to a word ( or a phrase )  . To overcome this problem , AcrEsDECOL 1NG-92 , NANTES , 2328 AOl~f 1992875 PROC . OFCOLING-92, NANTES , AUG .  2328 ,   1992 we introduc extensional roles which allow to be moditied by the addition of "/ constraint "  . 
2, 2.2 Word feature-structure
Word has six features . These are semantic lizature ( DDF ) slot , numerical-value slot , date slot , constmtint slot , modality slot , and word string slot . 
Using the semantic feature , the event feature-structure will be determined during semantic interpretation process  . 
Six classes of semantic features are defined , such as INDIVIDUAL , ELEMENT , THING , ACTION , LOCATION , and TIME These classes are instantiated to the Domain Dependent semantic Features  ( DDF ) when tile domain is decided . 
The constraint fcmure restricts the feature-su ' ucturc of brother word sort  ) hrases . Furthcrlll Ore , tile constraint feature determines the relations betweel lword feature-structure and event feature -structure  , ht Japanese language , a word which have a ACTION DDF usually has the constraint feature that determine stile slots of event feature-structure  . 
The numerical-value slot expresses numerical value of a word  ;  0 ,  1  ,  2 , -- ( one ) , ? i ( hundred ) , :1"-( thousand ) , and so on . The calculation of count thgup and down is necessary  , so all figures are separated . Then mnerical-value feature will be expressed as folh  ) ws . (Onr notation of a feature-structure is ~ eature - name = feature-value\]  . )\[ numerical-value=\[s~icr')~!!dTidg~it .   .   .   . \]\] The date slot expresses event occurrence time and is expressed by the Christianera  . In the Christianera , days are counted by numbers , so that date slots arc calculated nsing the numerieal-value fature  . The date slot has a minute slot , a second slot , a hour slot , a day slot , a month slot , and a year slot . Eacl l slot is expressed in nmnerical value . 
The modality slot is classilied into three c , ' t t c g o r i e s ; t e n s e , aspect , and u qood . Since tile tense and aspect are linguistically Iixed  , we use an ordinary categorization . 
However , mood is needed to be categorize differently , because the information unit used this system is an event  . 
So we categorized mood as a combination of Bratman ' sBelief-Desire-lntenlion model\[  1 \] and modalogic . That is the skate of event is expressed hymodal logic  ( necessary operator , possible operator , and negation sign ) and the attitude of speakers carttx ~ cthssiliod into belief  , desire , and intention . For example , a seurence I think itts possible to construct a plant there will be expressed as Belief  ( Possible li ' , where Emeans an event ; construct a plant there , that is , the individual believes that E is possible . 
Furthermore , it is necessary to consider usituation in which information is transferred  . In tfie newspaper , it is created by journalists who get information from other services  ( person or company information bureau )  , ht this situation , the event aml the attitude of file in forumtion possessor  ( IP ) is transported to a speaker ( SP )  ; journalist . 
The journal is then reexpresses the information to reflect his attitude  . If the modality of IP and SP are expressed as M odalit ~  , / se () , Modal it Ylv () , respectively , information in newspaper is expressed as , Modality sp ( Modality , e(EVENT ))) . 
If the target document is newspaper , the LIS form includes the modality of speaker ( Modality sp ) and the modality of information possessor ( Modality lp )  . 
2.3 Projection Mechanism
Parsing is done using Morphological analysis and Dependency  zmalysis\[4\] attd yields a syntactic tree for a sentence , After the parsing , we search a feature-structure dictionary to extract feature-structures of all words related to the domain  . To perform semantic analysis with limited knowledge  , word feature-structures are prepared only for abstract words  . The registration of proper nouns are left to the user  . The semantic engine infers the semantic meaning of words or phrases from the system default and user registrations held in the dictionary  . This means the semantic engine do not need all knowledge of words for semantic interpretation  . Thus only a small amount of words need to be maintained  . 
After attaching the appropriate word feature -structure to all important words  , semantic interpretation can proceed . 
From the type of propagation for the feature -structure in a parsing tree  , there are two types of features . One is the synthesized type whose value is calculated from sonst of atber relationship of the parsing tree  . The other is the inherited type that are calculated from father or brothers  . 
Word string , DDF , numerical-value , date , and modality features are synthesized type and other features  , such as consmdnt and role are inherited type . The propagationer a feature-structure is accomplished by unification calculus  , but the grammar is different . 
For DDF features , the grammar is as follows.
Ii '. I ) DF : := iml ~ fini ~ e
N . DDI'"::=NI.l)l)Fq~N2. DDFq , .. DDF
N . I ) DF : := individaal ( company ) lelement ( corapm~y ) lm one ylmanl product laction ( company ) llocation\[timeNote:Uncapitalized words mean terminate and capitalized words mean nonterminate  . Emeans EVENT node structure and N means other node structure and N  . DDF means DDF feature-value in node ' N' . Symbol ' n ' is the number of nodes . Operator , ~ means unification operator . 
For the constraint feature,
E , constraint : := ~( NI . DDF@E ) i = l , . . . , n
N . . . . . . t,'aint ::= ~ ( N) . DDF@N)j = l, .   . , nN . conslrain l : := feature-structure of brother nodes ACRESDE  COLING-92  , NANTES , 2328 AOL'T1992876 PREC . OFCOLING-92, NANTES , AUG .  2328 ,   1992 Tiledale and nunierical-value features are ralJlOrCOlU-plicated because we have to  0col with the semantic mo , ' tn-ing of time . 
The grammar of l ~) r the date feature is , N . date : := Ni . dale ~ h'2 . dal ~ . \]  .   .   .   . q , N , , . da&
Sff ' olld:???\]lollr ~,'?
N . dale : := da.q .....
l~lOl~l/t:.-?ijeal.=:,?.
Tile calculation of number auddate features is done like a stack  . Then mnerical-value fature has one stack and date feature has six stacks  . 
For example , lbr the number 1992 , all die numbers ,  1 . 
2 . and 9 , are expressed as follows , 1 ~\ [ numerical-value = ( oval ( push-number-stack 111\]2 ~\[ numerical-value = ( eval ( push-nuulber-sluck2 ) )\] 9 ~ \[ numerical-vulue = ( oval ( pusll-numbur-stack 9 ) ) Note : Symbol ' oval ' i/lealis ltlal next \[ oi112 will be evaluated by Common-lisp , Symbol'push-stuck ' is the lunction I hatputs the argumemw due outhe topeltile stuck  , The equation lottile nun/eric/l-value of 1992 is ,  1992 . numerical-value=\[numerical-value = ( wtl ( push-number-stack1 ) )\] ~\[ numerical-vuluc = ( ovid ( push-number-stack 9 ) )\] ~\[ numerical-value = ( wil ( push-number-stack 9 ) )\]  ( 9\[ numerical-value = ( eval ( push-number-stack2 ) )\]J which , after evaluation , gives as the value of 1992 as follwing expressions , to uting riht to left , tirst digit being 2 . second digit begin 9 , and so on , first-digit=:2\] second-digit 919 92 . numerieal-value = third-digit 9 fourth-digit 1 If we process the phrase , 1992 ~ q " . ( year 19921, the equation becomes , 1992 ~ . date : 1992 . numerical-value , \] , date : ( eval ( if SELF numerical-value )   ( push-year-stack SELF . numerical . value ) ) ) jNote:Nonteriifinate'SELF ' refers to the sell leaturc-structure Symbol ' push-year-stuck ' is the functiou that places the argument value to tile year stack illl he date feature  . 
Then and we get the time feature-structure as , \[1992 t , F . .date = \[ year = 1992\] \] The grammar for modality is quite simple , E . modality : := Nl . modality ~ l,N ~ . modality it , ? . . N ,, . modality N . modality : : : NI mol q . ~ A " ~ . tnodulity q , ? . . N,, . modolitqN . modalit ? l : := t~n,~c , ti , + p~(t . ut ~ dmood 2 . 4 Al l example of the pro ject ion process in t i le semantic engine This passage comes from Tile Nikkan-kougyoushiu-bun  ( Daily Industrial Newspaper )  . The headline is " il ~ Co . . Ltd . is constructing a new plant to assemble large scale steel bridges in W~t kay a ma-ken  . ) .

Ill this example , we use "~- . ~l~-J/h ' ~" ( company act ) domain . 
Tile system rougldy separates events and extracts all events which related to the dolnaill : corupany act  . From tile featn re-structure dictionary , file sentence was quickly reviewed to determine whether there is a word which has an ACTION DDF or not  . If there is no such word , the system the astops analyzing the sentence . In the example , the Iirst sentence ( S1) is made of two events . One is " J  ~ ( construction ) " and the other is " D , ~\] ~\[ l(agreement ) " . The two events are connected by "$--5~~"~" ( surukoto-de ) " . 
So seutence ($1) is separated to two events . Senteuce $3 does not have an ACTION DDF , so further analysis is not couducted . 
Therefore , we call obk ' l in live events from five sentences ; SI to $5 .

The first stage is attaching a feature structure to each word  . 
Let's consider the Event4 in $2; "~75~?9~3 Lg ~ , ~~ f'c~t ~ IL'J-~o " ( Construction on the new plant facility is slated to begin this coming spring  . ) , lit this passage , there arc three Bunsetsu , five independem words , three delxmdent words .

Dl ) F'meansIhlU if the DDF feature value is unified to the one node  , then variable '_ agent ' is tx ) unded to that node's feature-structure . Variable * article-year * is bounded to the date of year when the article is publishezl  . 
The example is parsed as shown in ligure 1.
Once the parsing is finished , the semantic thter pre-tution process begins . Node n\] wilth a vetile feature-structure timt is the result of calculation between the feature -structure of " ~  ( raisynn ) " and "7 ~ , b(kara ) " , but the word "2 , ~ C9 ( kava ) " has no leature-structur cso thcfeature-structure of " ~  ( raisyun ) " ul , is propagated to node nl . The feature-structures of all nodes are calculated same way  . 
For the constraint l cature , uniiication was done to all brothers . For example ,\[~( tgenl . Dl ) t "= ( raisyun )   ( kara )   ( shin )   ( koujyou ) (ke~etsu ) (ni )   ( chakkou ) (suru ) ???? ? ul u2   u3   u4   u5 Figure 1 : First stage of syntactic tree iJ . lividual ( comprmv ) \] means that one brother node is needed which have the DDF value of agent  ( company )  . 
If there is a node which satisfies the constraint , then the variable_agent is\['rounded to that node feature-structure  . 
If there is no node which satisfiestile constraint  , then variable_agent is unbounded . 
Try to think about the constraint feature in " Jd ~P  . 
( kensetsu ) " . There is no node that has agent ( company ) in DDF , but there are nodes which satisfy the constraint , such as the ~ action , _object , and_time which are bounded to nodes n3 , n2 , hi , respectively . 
Finally we get the event feature-structure of top node n-top  , shown in figure 2 . 
3 An abstraction using the LIS form 3 . 1 The basic method of the abstraction In tile abstraction  , we utilize classification of the LIS ouq mt . First , a sentence is put into the LIS form by the semantic engine  . 
TIleLIS output is used to commence the abstraction procedur c  . To extract information from sentence , we think classilica Uonistile best way . The semantic engine analyzes sentence in fixed domain  , after the semantic attalys is . Sentence stire classilied whether an event or not  , art dtile system extracts the events which are related to the domain  . 
Finally , ABEX provides a abstraction . One abstraction proposed here is the classification of event occurrence time and similarity of event  . This classification reveals the relationships of each event  . Individual event occurrence times will be determnined from value of the time feature and the similarity of events is calculated by comparing event feature-structure slots  . 
Tile other method is classification by the modality of information  . Front the viewpoint of Modality tp , we can classify an event according to the modality of information possessor  ( 1P )  . If there is no modality in the event , we classify it as ' fact ' . Others are classified using modality feature . This classification of tile event's modality reveals the attitude of the information possessor  .

4 Conclusion
We have described a I'ranle work I ( )r a now ahsIraciitnl method that utilizes classilication  . Classilication is performed using tile outpnt of usenlantic engine that is based on LIS form  . Since the LISI on n takes into account he incompleteness of knowledge  , the system requires curly a small amount of knowledge to i  ) erfoma the setnaatic analysis . 
First , ABEX utilizes the selectivity of the semantic engine according to the domain and the event  . Furthermore , ABEX classify accorcling to tile LIS constituents such as  , TIME modality and so on . The generation mechanism is poor , btttahstraction by classification is an easy way mak-illg all ahsffact  . Furthermore , the chtssification letilod descrihed here well supports human abstract tasks  .
