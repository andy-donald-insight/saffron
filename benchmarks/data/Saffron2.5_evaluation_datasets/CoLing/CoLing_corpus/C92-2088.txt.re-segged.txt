1 Introduction
It has become widely accel ) ted that developing a largescale semantic dictionary is indispensable to future natural language research  . ILL recent years , several research activities for compiling selnantic dictionaries to tnatura language processing have been uudcr-taken One of the approaches in this research is attempts to compile dictionaries by band  . Japan Electronic Dictionary Research Institute ( El ) R . ) is now compiling conceptual dictionaries\[5\] by hand with the help of software tools . \[ nformation-4echnology Promotion Agency ( IPA) , Japan , has also compiled IPA Lexicon of the Japanese Language for computers  ( II'AL ) \[4\] .

probh' . Inssoc bas a huge alnount of manila \ [ labor , difficulties in extending tile dictionaries , unstable re-milts , and so forth . 
A noth crapproach is to compile dictionaries using some teclxm ques of lexical knowledge acquisition  . 
One~nch approach is to extract hierarclfical relations or it the sanrtm of conceptual items froln hun L all dictionaries in an automatic way  . q ) surrnnaruetel . 
studied to construct at LeSaLL rlIs of nominal concepts from noun  detinitions\[t3\]  , qbmiara et al also extracted snperord in at c -subordmat c relation between verbs from the defining sentences in  IPAL\[12\]  . lies id cs the sercs easches , there are other several research activitics tbr lexical knowledge acquisition  , which syntactically an Myze the sentences m large corpora and att cmp t to extract lcxical knowledge from statistical data  \[3\]   \[1\]  . Most of the works undertake shallow analysis of texts and they extract only superticial lexical information  . 
For the development of tile techniques of knowledge acquisition from natural anguage texts  , it is very important to improve the httter approach of cornpiling semantic dictionaries by comimterl  ) rograu L ~ . I low-ever , there are at least two basic difficulties in this at  ) preach 1 . Tirei ~ robh ~ m ( ff syntactic ambiguities When analyzing a sentence  . , syntactic ambiguities often remain . So i ~ is not easy to obtain correct parsed results automatically  . 
2 . The , probh ~ rrr of polyue , my it often happens that one word has several meanings and corre  . sponrlsto , ~ cveral concepts . So it is not easy to associate ones m'fa ~ e word witholle correct concept Halitem  . 
Our approach to solve these diiliculties is to make use of translatitm cxarn ples in two distinct languages that have quite different syntactic structures and wordmf ~ anings  ( such as English and Japanese )  , and to c ( nnt ~ are analyzed results from each language , hmany(:asc ~ , the two languagcs Lave differentypes of syntactic ambiguities  , anticomparison of syntactic structures of both bmguagcs helps to resolve the ambiguities  . Also , a pair of bilingually equivalents nr face words helps to  a~'4ociate tile words with conceptual Ac~s DECOLING-92  , NANTIiS , 2328 AOIJT 1992581 l'~oc . OFCOL\]NG-92 . NANTES . AUG .  2328 ,   1992 words helps to associate the words with conceptual items  , because the intersection of conceptual items that each surface word has could be considered as one conceptual item\[ll\]  [2\]  . \[" or example , intire case of the translation example given in Example  1  , both syntactic and semantic ambiguities are resolved  . 
Example 1
E : I hungmy coat on the hook.
J:~:L(I ); ~( topic ) ~2~( coat)~(ca . se-m~trker )  ~'5"  ( hook ) lZ ( case marker ) zi '$ ~' f: ( hung ) o1 . Syntactic disumbiguation The English sentence in Example  1 is syntactically ambiguous because the prepositional phrase " on the hook " can modify both the verb " hung " aadtim noun phrase " my coat " using grammatical knowledge only  . On the other band , in the Japanese sentence , the phrase "7) ~' , Is_"can modify nothing but the verb "~ t ; tf : " . Thus , if knowledge about word equivalence pairs such as  ( I ,  ~ ,  ) , ( hung , ~' ~ t :) , ( coat , _t - . ; a ) , ( hook , ~' g ) are available from bilingual dictionaries , the ambiguity of pp-attachment is resolved by syntactically matching the structures of the two sentences  . 
2. Semantic disambiguation
The verb " ~ ) ~l ~" intile Japanese sentence is a typical Japanese polyserny  . This verb has six subentries in a Japanese dictionary that has about  70  , 000 entries , and ten English equivalent verbs (" hang " , " spend " , " play " , etc . ) in a JapaneseEnglish dictionary that has about 50  , 000 entries . 
So , it is not easy to associate the surface word " ~ qJ ' ~ " with its exact meaning  . I lowever , with the translation examl)le , the corresponding English verb such ms " hang " helps to find the mean-irrg of the Japanese verb  "7~19  ~ , 5'' . 
In this paper , we propose a method for resolving the syntactic ambiguities of translation examples in bilingual corpora and a method for acquiring lexical knowledge  , such as case frames of verbs and attribute sets of nouns  . In our framework , first a pair of sentences of both languages are syntactically ana-lyzedt and translated into feature descriptions  , which represent dependency structures of the pbrases in the sentences  . Although feature descriptions are generated by grarnmatical knowledge only  , they are quite suitable to represent case frames of verbs  . Then these feature descriptions of the two languages are compared  , or unified , using knowledge about word equivalence from bilingual dictionaries  . In this matching process , one word in the English sentence could be eqnivalent to several words in the translated Japanese  1Tbe Japanese morphological analyT ~ rlm . s 14 part of a peech and about 36,000 words . The Englisb dictionary contains about 55 , DO0 words . The current Japanese and English grana-mar ~ consist of  85 DCG rules a ald 135 DCG rul~-s . 
sentence . Also one word in the Japanese sentence could be equivalent to several words in the translated English sentence  . In order to realize the matching process between two languages including these several word equivalence cases  , we introduce a unification algorithm based on sets of compatible pairs of atomic values and feature labels in Chapter  2  . 
In Chapter 3 , we statistically evaluated the process of syntactic disambiguation  . The success ratio of disambiguation is about 63~68 % for translation exam-pies in a JapaneseEnglish dictionary  . At present , we have already collected about 50 , 0 00 translation exam-pies from a machine readable JapaneseEnglish dictionary  ( Kodansha JapaneseEnglish Dictionary\[10\] ) and an English learners ' textbook . We have extracted case frames for several verbs as a simple experiment  . 
The results are described in Chapter 4.
2 Un i f i ca t ion o f Feature De-sc r ip t ions o f Two Languages  2  . 1 Unification based on Sets of Compatible Pairs of Features and Values In our framework of sentence analysis  , a sentence in each language is parsed and translated into feature descriptions  , which represent dependency structures of the phrases in the sentence  . Ill this section , we basically use and extend Kasper and Rounds ' notation of feature description logic  ( FDL\[6\] ) to describe our unification algorithm of feature descriptions  , except that we don't use path equivalence . 
When unifying feature descriptions of two languages  , knowledge about word equivalence taken from bilingual dictionaries i used to decide whether all atomic value of one language is compatible with an atomic value of the other language  . This is also the casc with feature labels . Knowledge about word equivalence from bilingual dictionaries can be regarded as knowledge about compatibility of atomic values and feature labels of feature descriptions  . 
From this standpoint , we introdnce a unificational-goritl Hn based on sets of compatible pairs of atomic values and feature labels  . 
Data Structure
Let A and L be sets of symbols used to denote atomic values and feature labels  . Let CA and CL be sets of compatible pairs of atomic values and feature labels  . 
That is ,   ( /A is the set of pairs of atomic value such as ( ai , aj ) ( al , aj ~_A ) , where al and ui are consistent andmfifiable , and Ct . is the set of pairs of feature labels like li , lj)(li , ljCL ) , where li and lj are consistent AC't'ESDE COLING-92  , NANTES , 2328 AOt ~ rr 1992582 PROC .

Unification Algorithm
Because of the compatibility scts , there is not necessarily a unique most general unifier of two feature descriptions  . When applying this algorithm to unify f e . a turc descriptions between two languages , we collect all possible unified feature descriptions and lind the most overlapping Ulfifier by a scoring function  , which is introd need later . The following detinition of UNIFY returns one possible unified feature description  . We collect all possible nnitied feature descriptions  . 
Function UNIFY(f , g ) returns one possible unified feature description : where fattdgare featur  ) edescmptions . 
1 . If f = NIL , then return g2 . Elseif g = N1L , then return f3 . Else iff = TOP org = TOP , then return "1'01"4 . Else iff , gEAtJCA and f --9 then return f(:g ) 5 . Else iff , gEA , if ( f , g ) GCA , tt .   .   .   .   .   . t . . . . . ( f , g ) else return TOP end . 
6 . Else if f = 1: a I at t d g = l : us , and IELUG'L , if ( alg :=) UNIFY(a : , a ~) , then return I : al9 else return " FOP end .

a In fact , in the case of tile tulific at lonoffeature descriptions of two languages  , ai of ( ai , aj ) (~ CA ) is an atomic value of ol~e language and a ) is a aatomic value of the other lmlguage . This is also the case with Iigild 13 of ( It , 1 ~)( ~ CI .  ), 7 . Else iff = l ! : a ! and g = lu : at , and (11 , lg )( ~ CL and ( aI ~ :=) UNIFY(ay , a ~) , then return ( I ) , , lg ) : aI ~ 8 .

First , for each word in the English sentence , equivalent Japanese words are extracted from English-Japanese dictionaries  , and for each word in the Japanese sentence , equivalent English words are extract e . d from JapaneseEnglish dictionaries 4 , Using this knowledge , any possible pairs of equivalent cott tent words that are included in the original sentences are collected  , and CAD , the set of these equivalent ( i . e .

Set of Compatible Pairs of Feature Labels In our framework of unification between two languages  , we assmne that the set of compatible pairs of feature labels  , CL , is constructed based on statistical data . That is , each feature label pair ( li , lj ) in CL has a probability pl j ( O < Pij <_1 ) calculated from statistical data . This Pij represents the probability that the semantic role of feature Ii in a specific feature description of one lamguage is the same as that of feature l  . iill another specific feature description of the other language  . For exaurple , for a specific English Japanese verb pair ( write ,  ~- ~ ) , the feature label pair ( subj , ?)?) is , ~ssumed to have a probability P , ubL ~" And for a not lmr English--Japanese verb pair  ( read , ~ t2) , tt le feature label pair ( subj , : b ? ) is assmned to have another probahility q subj , h ' . 
Since we are at the starting point of our project of lexical knowledge acquisition  , we initially assign 1 to tire probability of each feature label pair , except 4At pre~ent , we use a Japan ~ e-English dictionary only , which has about 50 , 0 (0 entries . 
5Words are divided into two categories : content words mid fmlctional word ~  . Content words are ones which can be the head of a phrase  , such msi1o 1111$ and verbs . 
for pairs that are known not to have ttle same case role from some grammatical knowledge  . These exceptional pairs are not contained ill CL , i . e . , tlmir probabilities are 0 . In fact , for the purpose of lexical knowledge acquisition , it is sufficient to assume the probability as 1 or 0  , because we need credible results for extracting lexical knowledge about the usages of words  . 
The Most Overlapplng Unifier
The scoring function SCOR . E ( h ) calculates the validity of a unified feature description h  . This function returns a 2-tnple of real numbers s , ( xl , x2)(xl , x2ER(set of real numbers )) , where xl is the number of word pairs extracted from bilingual dictionaries and contained ill the unified feature description  , on the other hand x~istile number of word pairs a L so contained in the unified feature description but not extracted from bilingual dictionaries  . 
More precisely , xl corresponds to tile number of word pairs ( Wo , ~9  , WD jop ) in the unified feature description that are elements of CAD  , and x ~ corresponds to the number of word pairs ( WND ~ , s , WNOj , p ) in the unified feature description that are elements of

The score of tile upper feature description is greater than that of tile lower one  . So in this ease , the upper one is regarded a stile correct ease frame example for tile pair  ( write ,  ~" < ) . 
3 Syntactic Disambiguation :
Experiment and Evaluation in order to evaluate how well syntactic ambiguities of translation examples are resolved  , we made all experiment of syntactic disambiguation using  189 translation examples extracted from a Japanese -English dictionary  . Firstly , each sentence of a translation exam-pie is syntactically analyzed and translated into feature descriptions  . For 44 translation examples , syntactic analysis of tile Japanese or English sentence is faile  . d . For those which are successfully analyzed , the average number of feature descriptions generated from ones cntcncc is  4  . 4 for Japanese and 17 . 1 for English . Secondly , these feature descriptions are unified . 
After this process of syntactic disamhiguation , from 86 translation examples , a uniquce e~sc framc of the unified verb pair of Japanese and English is acquired  . 
Calculating from this result , the success ratio of acquiring unified case frames of verbs  ,   ( the number of translation example such that a unique unified case frame of verbs is acquired from each translation exam-pie  ) /  ( tile uumher of translation example such that each sentence is successfully analyzed  )  , is 86/145 = 59 . 3% . And the success ratio of syntactic disambiguation  ,   ( tile number of sentence such that a unique ease frame of the verb is acquircd from more than one feature descriptions  ) /  ( tile number of sentences such that more than one feature descriptions are originally generated  )  , is 70/103 = 68 . 0% for Japanese , and 84/133=63 . 2% for English . 
4 Lexical Knowledge Acquisi-tion of Verbs 4 . 1 Acqu i r ing Case F rames o f Verbs As described ill  2  . 2 , a feature description unified between English aud Japanese is as below  .

Once a large amount of this kind of data is collected  , statistical data ahout case frames of verbs eaal he extracted  , making use of a thesaurus of nomin M concepts 7 . In the remainder of this section , we will illustrate a general procedure for acquiring case frames of verbs  . 
Lctus start with a collection of a large amount of unified feature descriptions like above for a specific Japanesc verb V ~  . Suppose that we want to get possible case frames of this verb  . By a case frame , we mean something tik ca feature description for this verb  , consisting of surface cases each of which is marked hyapost positional particl cp ~ and some specific semantic categories taken from a thesaurus like BGI\[  . Usually , averh has several distinct case frames . However , it is not easy to extract those case frames automatically only from the collected unified feature descriptions  . 
So the system finds critical points to distinguish possible case frames for a verh using some heuristics  , then it ask stile human instructor whether the distinctions of ease frames arc correct  . These heuristics and human interactions arc smmnarized as follows  . 
7At present , ~moiL-line thesaurus called ' Bunrui Goi Hyou ' ( BGH ) \[8\] is available for Japanese . BGII has a six-layered abstraction hierarchymrd more tmat  60  , OOO words are assigned at the leaves . At the presett stage , it is nt ot certain whether this the ~ sautims reliable enouglt for our initial research target of acquiring case frames of verbs  . It is , however ~ the most precise and broadcoverikg 3apsmeae thesaurus obtahtable for us , currently . 
ACRESDE COLING-92 , NANTES , 2328 ho~r1992585PRO ( . OFCOLING-92, NAN'I'ES , AUG .  2328, 1992
Heuristics 1 . Semantic Categor'y in a Thesaurus First , collect the nouns marked by pj in a feature description of the verb Vj from the set of unified feature descriptions  . Then mark each collected noun in the thesaurus . If the most specific common layer of the marked nouns is low enough  , then we assume that the case marked by pj takes a noun of the semantic ategory that corresponds to that layer  . But if the most specific common layer is higher than a predetermined layers  , the information provided by that layer is too general fortile semantic ategories of the case marked by pj  . For instance , it is quite rare that both an animate concept and an abstract concept can be the subject of a certain verb  . Such a case strongly suggests that the verb has at least two distinct conceptual meanings or two distinct case frames  . 
It then becomes necessary to classify the marked nouns in the thesaurus  . 
2. Bilingual Intersection of Concepts
Some of the heuristics come from the advantages of bilingual intersection of concepts  , which we have already shows in Chapter 1 as semantic disambiguation . For a Japanese verb Vj and its case marked by a postpositional particle pj  , suppose that unified feature description such as \[ pred:  ( VE l , Vj ) , ( IEI , pj):NE1 , NJI)\] and\[pred:(VE2 , Vj ) , ( IE 2 , pJ):(NE2 , NJ2)\] are oh-tained . Both of these two feature descriptions have a feature label pj for Vj  . l lowever , if VE1 and V~2 are different verbs or IEl and IE2 are different feature labels , these two feature descriptions may be classified into different case frames of the verb Vj  . 
3. Correlation of Cases
Another heuristics are related to sentence patterns of verbs  . Sometimes the ease marked by pj has a correlation with other eases in sentence patterns  . If the correlations between cases are detected , then it help stile classification , and some sentence patterns ( or c0 . seframes ) of the verb Vj will be a eqnired . 
Human Interactions
As described above , the system can find critical points to distinguish possible case frames for a verb by those heuristics  . The system , however , cannot determine the distinction only with positive data collected from examples  . The main purpose of human interaction is to obtain negative xamples  . The system asks the human instructor whether a case marked by p  J1 and another case marked by P J2 call cooccur or not . If STile\] ) redetermined layers depend on tile thesaurus we are dealing with  .

they cannot co = occur , then the system learns that V jlets at least two sentence patterns  ( or case frames ) and that one of them has the case marked by P J1 and tile other has the case marked by P J2- An example of human interactions of this type is shown in next section  . 
It is often said that hand made semantic dictionary contains quite unstable data  , which means that it strongly depends on the human composer  . In order to acquire stable lexicat knowledge base  , we decided to limit hmnan interactions to yes no type of questions and answers  , such that the system asks the human instructor whether something is true or false so that he can answer only yes or no  . 
4.2 Examples and Evaluations
Wc have collected about 50 , 0 00 translation exam-pies from a machine readabled al ) anese-English dictionary and an English learners ' textbook  . In this bilingual corpus , about 70 distinct Japanese verbs appear in more than 100 examples . We have obtained unified feature descriptions for several verbs which appeared more than  200 times .

C ' a , I say , , . .' t Y ( pen ) - r . ( with ) l ~ . ~, l ~( English ) " C(in ) ~< write )"? .   .   .   .   .   .   . YES . 
QUESTION 2:
Cat , I say " 2 - - I - " U . a , ' d ) ~5 ( o , ,) 5t \[ I , , the , ') ~5 ( t , ,) ~ < ( , mr , O '' .   .   .   .   . NO . 
The postpositional particle "~:" is used to mark two different cases of the verb "~<  ( write ) " in Japm~ese sentences . One of them represents things on which smnething is written like in " wrile something on  , sh ~: et of paper " , and the other reI ) resents someone to whoma correspondence is written  , like ill " wtal caletter to a lover " . The difference of these two usages is clear by t i t  ( : bilingual feature label pairs ( on , ~=) and ( to ,  ~ ) . ' File human instructor answers that only these two ease slots cannot cooccur  . Then two case frames are obtained as in Table 3 . 
This simple experiment suggests that it is quite possible to acquire case frames of verbs from bilingual corpora if enough translation examples are available  . 
Actually , on tim assumption that 200 translation examples arc necessary for acquiring case framcs of on c verb  ,  100 , 0 00 translation examples are necessary for 70 verbs . If a bilingual corpus of 1 , 000 , 000 translation examples is obtained , it is possible to compile a semantic dictionary with the same scale as IPAI  , through a little interaction with a human instructor for each verb  . Wc think it possible to construct a bilingual corl  ) us of that scale or more in the near fit-lure ,   5 Concluding Remarks We haw ~ proposed a method for resolving the syntactic ambiguities of translation examples of bilingual corpora and a method for acquiring case frames of verbs  . At present , we are extending our prototype system for acquiring case frames of verbs  , attd the detail of the extended system will be reported in the future  . We believe that the I ) roposed method is applicable to sew : ralot ller problenrs as well  . One of them is to acquire features of nominal concepts  . We are at the moment looking at some specitie nominal expression " Aq  ) B " in Japanese , corresponding literally to " I1 of A " in English . That expression specifies a variety of relationships of noun phrases  , which are often stated in different expressions in English  . They will help to acquire typical attributes of nominal concepts fl ' ombilingual corpora  . Our ntethod is also useful to collect parsed traamlation examples tbrexample-based translation  \[9\] attd to acquire translation patterns between two languages  .
