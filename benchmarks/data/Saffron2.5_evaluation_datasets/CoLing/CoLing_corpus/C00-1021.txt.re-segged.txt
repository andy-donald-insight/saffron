The conmmnicative function of the sentence can basically be rendered by understanding its topic  ( T ) as ' what is the sentence about ' , and its focus ( F ) as the information that is asserted about the topic  , i . e . , schematically , the interpretation of the sentence S can be understood as s-F  ( T ) Thus , (1) ( a ) asserts , on its preferred reading ( with just the locative modification constituting its focus  ) about where English is spoken that it is in the Shetlandt  , which hardly can be accepted as truew . r . t , what we know of the actual world , if no specific context is present . (1) ( b ) is understood as true , stating about E . that it is spoken in the S . 
In the TGTSs the order of nodes is such that all parts of T precede all parts of F  . Moreover , the order of nodes corresponds to the scale of communicative dynamism  ( CD , see Section 3 below ) ; a less dynamic node prototypically has the broader scope than a more dynamic one  ( if the nodes correspond to operators )  . F proper is then the most dynamic ( the rightmost ) node . 
TFA is relevant also t br the semantics of negation  :   ( 2 ) John ( a )   ( b ) didn't come because he was ILL . 
The reason for Jolm's not-coming was his illness.
The reason for John's coming ( e . g . to the doctor ) was no this illness but something else ( e . g . he wanted to invite the doctor for a party ) . 
With the paraphrase ( a ) , the negated verb ' come ' is included in T , i . e . the fact that John's being ill is the cause of an event is asserted about the event that he did not come  . With ( b) , the main verb ' come ' alto belongs to T , but what it negated , is the relation between T and F : John came , but what is asserted about his coming is that the cause of this event was no this illness  ( he might have been ill , though ) . 
Every node in a TGTS is either contextually bound ( CB ) or non-bound ( NB )  ; this opposition is a linguistic couter part of the cognitive dichotomy of ' given ' vs  . hmw ' , where also an item , if corresponding to a ' given ' referent presented as occupying a newly characterized specific position  ( often in relation to one or more ' given ' items )  , has the feature NB , cf . : (3) Giveth , is to YOUR mother . ( Myparents don't likes ~ tch gifts . ) kno ', , , so thete , ", lane . ) Ho , . 
ever , th.is times he only invited IIER.
The indexical pronoun ' your ' in ( 3 ) and the anaphoric pronoun'her'in ( 4 ) can only rethrto items that in a sense are ' known ' in the given situation  . However , in these examples , both of them occur as NB ; their stress indicates their flmction as F proper of the respective sentence  . 
Prototypically , an NB node belongs to F and a CB node is in T ; however , a node not dependent immediately on a finite verb  ( esp . an adjunct ) need not meet this condition . Thus , in (5) , ' my ' as a shifter , directly determined by the conditions of the discourse  , is CB , although belonging to F , since it ; depends on a part of F ( see ( Haji Sovi ~ et al ,  1998 ) f bradefinition of T and F on the basis of contextual boundness and of syntactic dependency  , as well as for other details of the given descriptive frmnework  )  . 
2.2 The attribute TFA in PDT
Three values of the attribute TFA are distinguished with every node in a TGTS :  1  . Ta noncontrastive CB node , which always has a lower degree of CD than its governor  , if any ; 2 . Fan NB node ( if different from the main verb , then following after its head word in the TGTS )  3 . Ca contrastive CB node

Thus , ' not to meet the condition of projectivity ' concerns tim ' analytic ' trees  ; this means , in other words , that this condition would not be met if the positions of x and y in the left-to-right order of the nodes in the TOTS  ( in the ' underlying word order ' ) always corresponded to their positions in the surface  ( morphemic and % na-lytic ' ) word order .

2 . 3 The pos i t ion of a restored node The degree of CD of a node that is being restored  ( i . e . supposed to have been deleted in the surface form of the sentence  )  , and thus also its position in the underlying word order  , is determined on the basis of its relationship to its governing node  . Since such a node ahnost always is contextually bound  ( with the exception of the specific case of coordinated structures  , see the Note after point 8 in Section 2 . 2 above ) , it is placed to the left of its governing word ; more specifically : ( a ) if the restored node RN depends on a verb , then : ( b )   ( c )   ( aa ) if RN is not the single item depending on the given verb token  , then RN is to be added in the ' Wackernagel position '  ; ( ab ) if RN has no sister nodes , then it is placed at the beginning of the clause ; if RN is restored as depending on a noun ( or adjective )  , IN is placed as the least dynamic dependent of this governing word  ; if more than one node are inserted as depending on one and the same item  , then their order should conforn l to tile systemic  ( % a nonical ' ) ordering of the valency slots ( see the remark on SO in Section 2 . 2 above , point 4) . 
Point ( a ) appears to be substantiated by the fact that e . g . the subject ) ronolln appears ill the zero form in Czech under similar conditions as the weak  , clitic pronouns , for which the position imlnediately to the left of the verb is typical  , cf . 
sentences such as V Sera ( on ) p ~' i gelpozd 5\] Yesterday ( he ) can to here late \] , Janu ( oni ) nevid Sli\[lit . :  . Jane-Accus they have-not-seen \] , o1"(On ) spal\[He was-sleeping\] . This concerns also such deletable items as e . g . the Directional with pfi-jet\[arrive \], cf . J and nes(sere/tam)ncp ~'~; jcl\[it . 
. John today ( he , ' e/there ) has-not-arrived\].
The appropriateness of these preliminary rules is being checke during the tagging procedure  , the results of which will be of importance for a more exact  ( and more complete ) formulation of the relevant parts of the description of the sentence structure of Czech  . This aspect also manyol ; h(; r1) oinl ; s of grammar . 
2 . 4 Under ly ing and sur face word order Within the tagging procedure  , tim differences between the two levels of the left-to-right order can be described  1  ) y movel nent rules , a preliminary tbrm of which can be brietly characterized as follows:  1  . if a node 1111 carries C and a node M2 de-l ) ending on M1 is 1 ) laced to the right of a node M3 superordinate o M1 in the surtkce word order , then M1 is placed immediately to the left of M2 in the resulting tree ; cf .

4 . in sentences exhibiting a secondary placement of IC  , the bearer of IC occupies the rightmost 1 ) osition in the resulting l : ree ; cf . 
example (\]) ( b ) in Section 2 . 1 al ) ove , in whi('h'English'istiletbt:usprol)er ; the as-suinl ) gion underlying the . t ) lacemen l ; of IC in a written text is that g ~ written form of ~ sentence may correspond to dit\[erent  ( silo-ken ) sentences , according to the differences of the 1 ) lacement of IC in the al ) l ) ropriate way of 1 ) renouncing t ; he sentence . 
3 The spec ia l case of focus sens i t i ve par t icles Since the focus sensitive particles are idengified  ( 1 ) y the flmctor value RHEM for ' rhematizer ' or ' focalizer '  )  , it is possitfle to use PDT also for as l ) ecitication of their occurrences in different positions  1  ) othin the det ) endency structure of the sentence and in its TFA . Tile starting hy-l ) otheses , which might be checked on the basis of PDT , are . as t bllows ( of . ( Hajieov 5 ctal . , 1998)): 3 . 1 Fo cus sensitive particles in i ) roto typical positions The 1 ) rotol ; yl ) ical syntactic position of a foc , al-izerca . llt ) e understood as that of a dependent of a verb node  ; thus , in examples like (10) or (11) , it is 1 ) ossible to specit : ylhescope of the foealizer as the whole subtree subordinated to lhever l  )   ( where " sul ) ordilml ; ed ' is undersl ; ood ast\]le transitive closure of klel ) en ( lent ' in the reflexives ( ' . nsc , so I : hat the , verl ) itself is in (' luded ) ; thest ' Ol ) e is divided into 1 ) a ( : k ground and focus of the fl ) calizer ( ti:' )  , as will 1) especified in 3 . 2 . 
Thus , in the interl ) retation of ( 10 ) on the reading ret ) rcsented ( with many siml ) lifications ) by ( 10' ) it is included that ( according to what P . 
knows ) among l ; hose whom % sawthere was no one elset ; han M(i . e . while ' T . saw'consti-l ; lll ; esl ; he1) ack ground of ' only ' , its fl " is ' Mary ') . 
Similarly , if in (11) the negation ( all ; houghex-\]n'css ( ' dl ) y~t prefix in Czech ) is handled as a det ) cn ( lelfl : of the\ , er \]) , its badground is the subject and tt ' includes 1 ) oth the vcrl ) an ( lt ; heoh . iect .

' hierarchy of comnmnicative dynamism The primary position of a focalizer illaTR is at the boundary between tile topic and the focus of the verb clause and the tbcus of tile clause is then identical totile focus of tile focalizer  . If afbcalizer is included in the topic , then its focus contains those items which in the TR are placed between this focalizer mid the next item ularked as C to tile right and aren lore dynamic than the tbcalizer  )  . 
It should be noted that CD is understood here as a partial ordering defined so that :  ( i ) in every set of a head and its daughter nodes , every daughter node placed to the right of its head is more dynamic than ev-cry daughter node placed to the left of its head  ;   ( ii ) the relation ' more dynanfic ' is deternlined by their rettexive trausil  ; ive closure of ( i ) . 
~i ' hus , e . g . in the TI(10') , ' knows ' is more dy-nalnic than ' Paul ' and less dynmnic than'saw ' according to tile point  ( i )  , and both ' only ' and ' Mary ' , being more dynanlic titan'saw' , are more dynmnie than ~ knows ' according to the point  ( ii )  ; however , ~ Thomas'is neithermoren or less dynamic than ' knows '  . If ( 10 ) is cut-bedded into a more conlplex sentence as ( a part of ) its topic , titan'Mary ' is more dynanficthml % nly ' and has the f~atm'eC  ; thus , e . g . with ' Since Paul knows that Thomassa wonly Mary  , he is not afraid ' , ' Mary ' constitutes the whole fl of ' only ' , similarly as in (10') . 
Tile underlying word order W ( a linear ordering ) is then defined on the basis of CD , with ( iii ) and ( iv ) holding tbrevery two nodes x and y in a tree : ( iii ) if node x is nlore dynamic than node y , then xt bllows y under W ; ( iv ) if node x follows node y under W , node u is subordinated to x and node z is subordinate to y  , the nut bllows both y and z , and x follows z under W . 
Among tile non-prototyt)ical , secondary positions of tbcalizers , there are also the cases of their clustering ( e . g . ' not only ') , as well as the sentences in which a focalizer itself constitutes the whole locus of tile sentence  ( ' HeDID realize this ' )  . 
4 Summary
After a brief characterization f the Prague Dependency Treebank and oftile Praguian theory of Topic-Focus Articulation we have presented a proposal how the main aspects of tile in tbr -nlation structure of the sentence  ( i . e . of its topic-focus articulation ) cml be integrated into the tagging system that captures the underlying structures  . The present form of the system nmkes it possible to check our hypotheses on a large text corpus  , and thus perhaps to achieve a higher degree of automation  ( and reliability ) of the proposed procedure . The last section exemplifies how the t ) roposed approach makes it possible to analyze structures with the socalled focus sensitive operators  .
