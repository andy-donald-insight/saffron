The Jachine realization of the periphrasing system
and the results of the experiment.
E.G . Arsent yeva ( Moscow)
The paper is devoted to the machine realization of the 
periphrasing system devised by I . A . Mel'chuk and A . K . Geolcovsky According to the idea of the semantic nature of a synthesis a deep sentence structure is used a minput data for the periphra-sing s j stem  . By the given rules which are mashing up as a matter of fact the periphrasing ~ ystem the other sentence deep structures are obtained from the given deep structure  , being equivalent by meaning . Both the machine realization of the periphrasin ~ ystem and the experiment carried outwre ~ intended to verify and to check out both the periphrasing system and the realizati-on programs  . Further the specified versinn of the periphrasing system is supposed to be included in a general system of a Russian semantic synthesis used for the machine translation  . 
The notions used in the periphrasing system are shortly described  . The detailed description of the semantic and syntac-ti ~ rules is given  . A paragrapher is devoted the detailed descri p tion of the machine dictionary  ( s . the paper of I . A?Mel'chuk and J . D . Apresyan ) . The algorithm periphrasing is given . 
The work of the algorithm is illustrated by some examples  .
