Abstract
This paper proposes a new disambiguation method for Japanese text input  . This method evaluates candidate sentences by measuring the number of Word Cooccurrence Patterns  ( WCP ) included in the candidate sentences . An automatic WCP extraction method is also developed  . An extraction experiment using the example sentences from dictionaries confirms that WCP can be collected automatic Mly with an accuracy of  98  . 7% using syntactic analysis and some heuristic rules to eliminate rroneous extraction  . Using this method , about 305 , 000 sets of WCP are collected . A cooccurrence pattern matrix with semantic a tegories is built based on these WCP  . Using this matrix , the mean number of candidate sentences in Kana . -to-Kanji translation is reduced to about 1/10 of those fi-ome xisting morphological methods . 
1. Introduction
For keyboard input of Japanese , Kana-to-kanji translation method\[ Kawada79\]  \[  Makino80\]  \[  Abe86\] is the most popular technique . In this method , Kana input sentences are translated automatically into Kanji-Kana sentences  . However , non-segment cd Kana input is highly ambiguous , be . .
cause of the segmentation ambiguities of Kana input into morphemes  , and homonym ambiguities . Some research as been carried out mainly to overcome homonym ambiguity using a word usage dictionary\[  Makino80\] and by using case grammar\[ Abe86\]  . 
A new technique named collocational analysis method  , is proposed to overcome both ambiguities . This evaluates the certainty of candidate sentences by measuring the number of cooccurrence patterns between word paix ~  . It is used in addition to the usual morphological nalysis  . To realize this , it is essential to build a dictionary which can reflect Word Cooccurrence Patterns  ( WCP )  . In English processing research , there has been an attempt \ [ Grishman86\] to collect semiautomatically sublanguage selectional patterns  . In Japanese processing research , there have been attempts\[ Shi-rai86\]  \[  Tanaka86\] to collect combinations of words with this kind of relationship  , eittmr completely-or semiautomatically . 
These two attempts did not provide a dictionary for practical use  . 
A new method is proposed for building a dictionary which accumulates WCP  . The first feature of this method is the collection of WCP from the common combination of two words having a dependency relationship in a sentence  , because these common combinations will most likely reoccur in future texts  . 
In this method , it is important o identify dependency relationships between word pai~s  , instead of identifying , the whole dependency structure of the sentence . For this purpose , Dependency Localization Analysis ( DLA ) is used . This identifies the word pairs having a definite dependency relationship using syntactic analysis and some heuristic rules  . 
This paper will first describe oUocational nalysis  , a new concept in Kana-to-Kanji translation , then the compilation of WCP dictionary , next the translation Mgorithm and finMly translation experimental results  . 
2 . Concept of Colloeatlonal Analysis in Trans lation Collocation Manalysis evaluates the correctness of a translated sentence by measuring the WCP within the sentence  . 
The WCP data is accmnulated in a 2-dimensional matrix , by information milts indicating more restricted concepts than the words can indica  . teby themselves . 
As previously mentioned there are two kinds of ambiguities in Kana-to-Kanji translation  . In Fig . i , disambiguation process of homonyms is illustrated  . ' NA ; R ( a national an them ) and ~\[~'~- ( to play ) ' and ' NAg (   ( a state ) aud ~ . ~-~-; 5 ( to build )' etc . are examples of WCP . If the simple K an a sequence ' ~_-~ h ~~- . ~ . /~~5~"; 5\[kokkao en sousuru \]' is input , the usual translation system will develop two possible candidate words ' NJN'  ( a national an them ) and ' NAg (   ( a state ) ' , for the partial K an a sequence of ' ~ ~ J h ~\[ kokk@The system will also develop uniquely the creed  ( date word , ' ~-?; 5 ( toplay ) ' for ' R . /~<--)-~-; 5\[ensousumq ' . These candidate words are obtained by table searching and mor-phologic Manalysis  . I to we ver , morphological analysis alone can't identify which one is correct for ' ~  . oh ~\[ kokka \] . 
Using eo ! loeation Manalysis , ~ heWCP of ' NA ~ . 7 , ~( a state ) ' and ' ~- ; 5 ( toplay )' is found to be nil , while that of ' NA ~ ( a national an them ) ' and ' ~ ; 5 ( toplay )' is found to be probable . Using WCP , ' NA ~ ik ~ ~ ~ ~"-5 ( to play a national an them ) ' is selected as the final candidate sentence . If the Kana sequence ' coh ~~ l:Y/b-t ~~ ~ "   . 5\[kokkaoken setsus nru\]'is input , ' NA ~-$ k ~: ; 5 ( to build a state )' is obtained in same manner .

\[422 words D , Then , among the morpheme sequences constructed with each segment  , the grammatically possible sequences are selected . 
Next , the candidate sentences with the least number of Bunsetsu are selected\[  Yoshimura83\]  . Furthermore , among tt ~ ese selected sentences , those which have the least number of words are selected  . In this process , a heuristic rule is used to prevent mor Pheme sequence mis-selection  . This rule rejects the combinations of nouns constructing a compound word  , if the usage frequency of either nouns is very low  .

The counting operation is carried out only on adjacent Bunsetsu  , because , in most eases , relationships are between adjacent Bunsetsu and determining extended relationships would prove to be too time-consuming  . 
Finally , the cand date sentence with the maximum WCP number is chosen as the prime candidate  . To prevent mistaken deletion of prime candidates caused by word pairs which rarely cooccur  , following rule is used . If the usage frequency of either word in WCP is low  , the , candidate sentences of which WCP number is less one than maximum ber  , are also identified as prime candidates . In following example , both are identified as prime candidates .
