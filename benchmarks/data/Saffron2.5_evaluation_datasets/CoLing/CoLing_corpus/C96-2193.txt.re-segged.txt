Abstract
We have constructed the IPA Lexicon of Basic Japanese Nouns  ( IPAL-BN )  , which has a hierarchical structure based on the syntactic and semantic properties of no  , ms . In our lexicon , each lexical entry consists of subentries , and subentries have semantic property information  . Among these elements , we focus here on the subentry description . 
Conventional Japanese dictionaries only enmnerate various usages  . But it is also important oclarify the semantic relations between subentries  . Thus we have developed a method for specifying the kind of relationship between subentries  , using special cognitiw ~ devices such as metaphor  , metonymy , and synecdoche . 
After a brief review of the structure of our lexicon  , we discuss how then lethod can be applied to the lexical description  . 
1 Introduction
Tile Information-technology Promotion Agency ( IPA ) i has compiled the IPA Lexicon of the Japanese Language for Computers  , Basic Japanese Verbs ( IPAL-BV )   ( 1987 ) and Basic Japanese Adjectives ( IPAL-BA )   ( 1990 )  . The IPAL-BV contains 861 verbs and the IPAL-BA contains 136 adjectives a ~ s lexical entries . These lexicons are available for public use and have been widely used in variousm fiversity and research institute projects that have yielded encouraging results  . We started work on the IPAL-BN project in 1990 . hiMay 1996 , we released tlie third edition of tile IPAL-BN , with 1 , 081 nouns as lexical entries , for the public on networks with FTP service . 
The IPAL project is characterized by its linguistic basis  . For example , the hierarchical structure iA special juridical body under the juris diction of the Ministry of International Tradc and Industry  , 

of the IPAL-BN , which consists of lexical entries , subentries , and semantic property information , reflects our linguistic considerations concerning the syntactic and semantic properties of nouns  . Another example of benefits fi'om our linguistically inspired approach is the description of the kind of relationship between subentries  . Such information would be useful in various applications  , but is not yet explicitly provided in existing Japanese dictionaries  . In the following sections , we first briefly introduce the general structure of the IPAL-BN  , and then describe our method for specifying the kind of relationship between subentries  . In the concluding renlarks , we also touch on implications of then lethod for tile application systems  . 
2 Structure of IPAL-BN
Figure 1 shows the toplevel structure of the IPAL-BN . The H'AL-BN consists of 1,081 lexical entries .

Figure 1: Basic Structure of IPAL-BN
Each lexical entry is conlposed of orthographic information  , idiomatic information , and suben-tries . Tile idiomatic in \] ormation accommodates the idiomatic or proverbial uses of the noun that have to be treated separately  . Let us take an example , Hanako-wa hana-ga takai . This Japanese sentence has the idiomatic meaning , " Hanako is proud , " in addition to the ordinary n leaning , " Hanako has along nose . " hit heidionlatic cases , the meaning of tile whole sentence cannot be decomposed into the meaning of each word  . Thus we reserve the idiomatic information separately fi'om Then we introduce a hierarchy  , subdividing each entry that has more than one usage of the word  . Each usage is (: ailed a subentry . The subdivision to subentry is based not only on semantic but also on syntactic haracteristics  . This categorization process can be ilhtstrated with an exam-pie of hank yo'echo':  hant:y5 q  ~ ( ' he'01 . a somMt , hat is reflected of fasurface such as tit ( : wallofal milding . 
Bbru-nooto-gahcya-nonatca-de hankyS-suru.
( The sound of the ballechoes in the room . ) 02 . one's ( , xpr(:ssion of an opinion about or at . tit . mh : toward som (' thing . 
Kon , oh anashi-wa hit obito-uokok or o-ni hwnky5-o yo bioko sudar S . 
(This story will arouse an echo in every man's heart  ) One may note that hanky&O1 has a usage in which a noun t ) ecomes a verb when followed by "- suru " , while hanky &02 does not . On the basis of tlf is ( lifference , we divide this i20 , 112 into these two subentries . 
Figure 2giw.'s an overview of each subc , ntry.
A subentry consists of subentry information and several pieces of semantic property information  . 
The subentry information contains syntaeti (: , semantic , and morphoh)gical information co , ninon to all parts of the subentry ( each selnantie property ilf for lnation section )  . The semantic t ) roperty information in ( hides syntactic and semantic information . In the case of hanky 5 , we use the syntactic information in the subentry information to describe  , tim difference in the usages ( Kuwahata ,  1995) .

Figure 2: Structure of Subentry
In addition , we examine the sul ) entries in more detail and introdu ( : e the concept , of the ast ) ects of nouns .  \[ , ' or example , ' the letter'in'I read the letter ' focuses oi1 tim information in the letter , whereas its counterpart in ' Il > urned the letter ' focuses on the thing  ( i . e . , piece of paper ) bearing that information . Since we can say ' I burned the letter that I had read '  , the word ' letter ' does not have two meanings but rather has two aspects  . 
Tirosanounis consi<lere < lhere to have various aspects depending on the predicates used in the sentence containing the noun  . These aspects are called semantic properties ( Aoyama ,  1995) . Instead of subdividing the lexical entry into multiple subentries  , we categorized the regular collocations in each subentry in terms of semantic properties  . 
For exan 2 ple , let , us take the word ha'tooth/teeth'which has three semantic t  ) rot ) erties . In our notation , the semantic properties are labeled by three letters in square brackets  . The phrases ha-omigaku'l ) rushone'steeth ' and ha-onuku ' pull one's tooth ' refer to toot has a concrete object \ [ CON\]  . And the phrases ha-gahaern ' cutteet lf and ha - ganukeru'h  ) seteeth ' imply ( natural ) phenomena\[PHE\] , while the t ) hrases ha-ga jobu-da't lave soundteet lF and ha -gaguragura-suru ' a toothfeelsh  ) ose'single out a condition of teeth from their potential conditions \[ POT\]  . 
3 Relationships of Subentries 3 . 1 Problem Most , existing Japanese dictionaries merely enumerate various usages  . But clarifying the semantic relations between those usages is important  . 
For exan 2 ple , the nount amago ' egg/spawn ' has three senses : tanuulo ' egg/spawn '  01  . a I lol ) jec~covered wit , It a hards hell or a membrane , produced by a female animal . 
Kingffo-gatarn ago-ourt da.
( The gohl fishs pawm:d . ) 02 . a heat'segg(i . e . , some kind of food ) . 
Hana ~: o-wat mago-oi chipa ~: kukatta.
( tlanako bought 1 doze neggs . ) 03 . at person ~ t t the Imginning of his/her carter . 
Hanal ~ o-waisha-notam , a.qo-da.
( Hanako is a dot : for lit the inaking.)
Ahen's egg ( 02 ) ix one type of object that ix covered witt la hards hell  ( 01 )  , and ( 03 ) is a metaphor with respect to the relation between hen'segg  ( 02 ) and hen . Our problem was to ex-plicidy ( lescribe these kinds of relations between meanings  . 
3.2 Approach
Ill the liter at , ure , several attempts \] lave already been made to analyze such senlantie relationships  2  . Yanlanasld (1995) , among others ,  1 ) oints out that apt ) re ( taring such special cognitive devices as metaphor and metonymy is the  2Ulhnann   , 1969; Lakoff and Johrlson , 1980; Kuni-hire , 1982; Yamanashi ,  1995 . 
1083 key to understanding polysemy . Weemt ) loy this method for sI ) ecifying the kind of relationship l ) e-tween subentries . Currently we note three types of relations : ? Metaphor  , based on similarities ? Metonymy , based on various (: ontiguitics ? Synecdoche , l ) as e . do il the relation between m(mtl ) ermM(:~0 ; (:gory Metaphor is the similm-ity-based instrument for exte  , Ming the meaning of words . At the outset met , al ) horical expressions are temporarily used figures of speech  . However , some metaphors conm to be fixed and pass into everyday use  . Let us take some examples : h . on-no mushi ' a worm of books ' ( a person who is crazy about reading )  , aras of not an e ' a seed of argument ' ( a cause for argument )  , and ko to ba-nokabe ' awall of words ' ( a language barrier )  . We regard these ext ) ressions as fl fll-fl edged usages of dm nouns , and accordingly descrihe them in the IPAL-BN , while teln poral usages are not considered fl ) r description in our lexicon . 
Metonynly is an instrument for employing a word to refer to something that distinct front  , hut , is associated in some way with , the original referent of the . word . Tyi ) ieal examples are Nabe-gaoishi , " The dishis nice ; " and Anokyateh & wa ( kata-oshiteiru , " The catcher has nice shoulders ( The catcher has a power fl flth row )  . " In the former , the reference has shifted from the container to the content  , and in the latter , the refl ~ . rence has shifted Dora the part of the body to its flmetion  . 
Synecdoche is the instrument hat take . s the name of a category to stand for one of its members or taking the  . name of one in eml ) erto stand for the whole category , as shown in the above hen's egg example : a hen's egg is one kind of object that is covered with a hards hell  . 
It is lint ) or ( ant not to confits e the colmoted re-latio , l of synec doche with the contiguity relation \[ part \]-\[ whole \] of llte to llyttly  . Let 11s take all ( ' x-ample of the relation\[part\]-\[whole \] to show the difference : tecarln/hmtd '  0l   . upl ) cr limbs of a hmnan(th(:(mtire . ty , consisting of ~ rIn ~ tiI ( lhmtd) . 
"Ha . na ~ : o-warySh S-note ohirog cta . "( Hmmkost ) r ( . ' ~ t(1her arms . ) 02 . the ( : ml of a person's arm ( t i t ( : part consisting only of the hand )  . 
': Hanako-watc-otata ita . "( Ilanako (: lal)I ) (' dhert tands . ) We do not consider the . \[ part\]-\[whole\]rlation hetweenthearm ( 01 ) and t ; he hand (02) to be all instance of syne(:doehe . Let us compare this example ofte ' arm/hand ' with the examph  ; of tam-ago'egg . ' Besides a hen's egg , there are tmmy other sorts of eggs , such as a turtle'segg , api-ge on's egg , midaswallow'segg . By contrast of the arl nasa whole , only the hand receives the de . ', , igiiation te . For e . xamph ' . , we do not also express the elbow as te ' a rm /h and  . ' Hence . we consider the contiguity relation \[ part\]-\ [ whole \] to be one type of metonymy  . We distinguish it fi ' om the member-category relation of synecdochea  . 
a . a Method
In this section , we will shows on m examples of description . 
Some metaphorical expressions need somenlod-ifier and others do ttt  ) t . 
kata'shoulder'01.ftana ~ : o-wa kata-osukumcta.
( Hanakos hrugged her shouhh : rs . ) 02 . Sonouwagi -' no kata-wa 5l :\[ . 
( Thai ; jacket has wide shoulders . ) 03 . Sonoyam , a-not : ata-niyama goya-garu . 
( There is a lodge on that mountain shonht cr . )((1) is a non-metaphorical use . ((2) and (03) are metaphorical uses . One may notice that , (02) can he used without y@zku-no ' of clothes ' , but ((13) requires yama-no'mountain- . ' We have the impression that ( 02 ) is conventionalized . 
We . classify metaphorical usages into two types : conventionalized and novel  . To the first group we assign expressions that can be used without being modified  . Such an expression is indicated by " A => B . " The second group is indicated by " A ? " . > B . " These mean that A is original and B in metaphorical  . We refer to the above relation , hence , as : "01::>02 .  01 " '> 03 . " It is hard to judge which is metaphor if both Se llSeS & re  (   ; on vell tiotlal . Consider : shi'wa ~ wrinkle'01 . Hana ~: o-wame-nomawari-nishi wa-gadekite ~: it a . 
( Hanako has go twrink lesr(mnd here yes . ) 02 . Hanako-wa shatsu-'noshi wa-o ait vn-denobashita . 
( Hanakoir oned out the wrinkles in her shirt . ) We regard ( 01 ) as non-metat ) horical nd ( 02 ) as metaphorical firsl ; group . 
Various contiguity relations cause metonymical extension  . We single () , at , the relation\[part\]-\[whole\]as one . group , and assign the other contiguity relations to a second group  . The first group is indicated by " A > > B " or " A << B " and the second group is indicated by " a\ [ X\]->\[Y \] B  . "" A >> B " means extension h'om\[whole\]to \[ part \] and " A < < B " lile  . ansextension in the opposite dire~cd on . " A\[X\]-->\[Y\]B"me . ansthat the relation \[ X\]-\[Y \] links A to B . These relations in chlde\[e ontainer \]-\[ e ontent \]  , \[ in a terial \]-\[ t)roduct\] ,  \[ , neans \]-\[ act\] .
