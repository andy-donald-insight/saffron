AUTOMATICRECOGNITION OF SPEECHSOUND SBYADIG ITAL 

Three contributions concern in ~ the discr imination of the moment an spectrums of somes e lected Finnish and 
German sounds
The main difficulties in the speech recogn ition may be listed in the following way : loWhich should be the basic linEuistic units to be re-cognized : sounds  ( allophones ) tph one mest segment combi-nations I syllab lesIwords ?  2e Should the output text be written or to graph ~ cally ? How then the problem of the diffe rences between the phonemic form of an utte rance and the ortography should be resolved ?   3  , If the word is chosen as basic units for the recogni-tion ~ how one should resolve the problem of the grammatical flexion  ( e . E . in Finnish ) ? ~ o How can the recognition automation dec ider where there is a boundary between two words or two sentences ?  5? How can the automation decide that ee E . the pause dur in Ealon Evoiceless stop consonant is not a boundary ?  6e How can the automation discriminate the tona l and croneme classes in la Eua Ees  9 in which they are l in Euisti-cally re levant ?  7e The automation should not take into account their rele-vant "- nols e$one must reEard also the noise produced by the automat i on itself ?  8  . How to localize the points in the speech continuum t which the recognition can be based on ~ is there one  . 
special acoustic segment ( or a moment an spectrum ) for every sound t which is characteristic , for the sound ?9 . It has been shown that segments , which are 1 ingu-istica 1   1 y identica It can be acoustically d ifferent  . The differences are due to follow in Efac to rs:  ( I ) The same speaker cannot produce two exact simi larsounds  , because the conception of the identity is a human abstraction  .   ( 2 ) Different speakers produce linguistical ly the same sound in a different way  . ( ~) Linguistically the . 
same . so ~ d can be modified acoustically by the word promi-nence  , sentence prominence I environment , emotional factors tspeech tempo I dialect a l background of the speakert speech defects t huskines stand so on  . eIo . Linguistica 1   1 y different sounds can be acoustical l ysimilar o  11  . Should the phonotactic Structures ( Sigurd ) or the characteristic sequencies ( Pike ) of a language be regarded when creating the recognition program ?  . 
12 . The technical problems for mone great part of the speech recognition  . They concern the mechanica 1 so 1 utions and the recognition pro- gramelo Vowel reco ~ rnition based on some selected vowel variables and discr iminant analysis  . 

The probability of correct identific at ion of the acoustically close German vowel phonemes / i : tIte : ~~ ty:  , and Y ~ on the basis of spectrographic input data and tile discriminant analysis  ( literate I , 2 r and ~) was calcu-lated . One male speaker were used . Following variables were measured : the f requencies of the four first formants  . ( Fie .   . 
F ~) I their amplitudes ( Lle . eL  ~ ) t the amplitude Of the zero ( minimum ) point between F1 and F2 ( here called LZI ) and that between F2 and F3 ( LZ2 ) t and the duration of the vowels . 
The probability of correct identific at ion was  94 percent on average . The highest identification probability was shown by the phoneme / e :/  ( 98 , 9~) and the lowest by the phoneme/Y/(85~7~) . The sounds were picked up from sentences read by the informant  . 
In the real classification procedure which was connected to the probabilistic recogn ition program  6 identifi-cations were false out of 103 possible . The order of the significance of the variab les studied regarding their discr iminatory power was  F2 sLZI ~ F1 tF~s durations LI ~ F3s L  ~ LZ21L3  . -One must take into account the possibili- ty that two variables  9 the discriminatory power of which is good ~ will correlate with each other  . In this case the better one is placed in a h igh position in the list I but the other one comes later than its real discriminatory power implies ~ because the correlation is taken into account  . If the better variable was . not considered ~ the weaker variable would perhaps take its place  ( if the correlation is strong enough )  . This may explain the fact that F3 comes after F ~ ( the correlation of F2 with F3 is strong concerning the vowels studied )   . 
The energy minimum between F1 and F2 ( LZI ) had a good discriminatory power . This showes that in the acoustic signal there can be cues ~ which are available in the automatic recognitions such cues ~ which need not to be relevant for perception  ( cf . Tillmann ~ p .  1~9)? 2 . Recognition based on the discrimination of the numerical models of sounds  . 
In the second experiment the input data of the recognition program consisted of the numer ical describers of the sounds  . They were formed by using constant points in the measurement of the spectrums of sounds  . Thus the describer of a sound consisted of a serie of numbers ~ which indicated the ampli tude at constant selected frequencies  . The narrow filter ( with 45 Hzb and width ) was used when producing the sections r which formed the material measured  .   32 measure-ment points inside the range of ~ kHz were used  . 
The describers for 330 Finnish sound manifestations were calcula ' ted  . These sounds were representatives for 8 short Finnish vowel or 3 nasal phonemes/a , e , i0o , u , y  ~ arormrn , n / .   30 representatives of every phoneme type were p ickedup from sentences read by a single male speaker  . 
The data thus obtained were stored and submit ted to the discriminating analysis  . The measurement points were handled as variab les  . 
The probability of correct recognition was about  60?   . ? 70% on average . One must regard rhowever r that the localiza tion of the sections was  ( under circumstances ) not very exact and the technical equipment was unfortunately not the best one  . 
3 0 Recognition based on the numerical models of sounds and a special recognition program  . .
In the third recognition experiment the F innish nasal sounds belonging to the phonemes / n/or/m/were tried to be classified automatically on basis of the numerical describers  , which are discussed in the preferring
J chapter.
Firstly the frequency area of ~ kHz wass tudied by means of  33 constant measurement points with distances of  121HZo The ' general ' describers for / n/and/m/ we recalcu-lated by means of the PROGRAMI  ( below )  . 
The basic material consisted of 87 wide hand sections ( made with Kay Electric Co . Sound Sona-Graph model 6061-B ) o The sections were made from the target poin to f  F2 of the nasals in single words ( all possible enviroD-ments were considered )   . The describers of/n/and/m/are presented graphically in fig  . Io The influence of the environment on the dental nasals  ( n ) seems not to be very great ( fig , 2) o one male speaker ( Finnish ) db 15--lO-

Wideband sections were used,
Secondly the numerical describers were restr icted so that only nine constant measurement points were considered  . 
The nine points with the best discr iminatory power were sought by means of the PROGRAMII  ( below )   . 
Thirdly the ' general ' numerical models fo r the both phonemes were calculated on basis of the nine points mentioned  . The logic of the procedure is described short -lyat the beginning of the program  ( PROGRAMIII )   . 
With the same method the numerical model of a new nasal sound was calculated  ( PROGRAMIII )   , and then as also und was classified by compa iring its model with the mean of the mode lsof/n/and/m/  . 
The main idea of classification is that the amplitudes at the nine measurement points are set on order of magni-tude  , and then their relative places on the f requency axis are indicated by means of the ordinal numbers  ( nine possi-bilities )   . The ordinal numbers are then placed one af ter  another9 so that they form one single number . This number i is handled as the numerical mode l of a group of n as also unds or a single nasal sound  . 
The classification time of a sound by means of method described here is only a frac tion of that when using the discrimination analys~s  . 
Final comments
Every language needs its own recognition program con-sisting of subprograms ~ which can be very different  . That the recognition program can be worked out implies that there is ~ sufficient amount of acoustic knowledge about the language in question  . 
It is possible that the complete speech recogni tion doesn't succeed with the computers ava ilable ~ so that we must waites olong that the biological computers are at our di sposal  .

If the recognition of the natural languages isn't possible  , we should consider the possibility of a nar ~ i-fical language  , which would be easy to be recognized by a machine  . 
If the social need of the recognition automat ions becomes very great  , it is possible that the conservative or tho graphy of many language will disappea ~ and the phonematic orthography will become common  .
