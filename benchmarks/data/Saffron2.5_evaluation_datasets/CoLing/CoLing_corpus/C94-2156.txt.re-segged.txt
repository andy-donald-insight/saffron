This paper presents the results of an experiment usiug machine-readable dictionaries  ( Mill ) s ) and corpora for building concatenativ cunits for text to speech  ( T'PS ) systems . Theoretical questions concerning the nature of t ) honemic data in dictionaries are raised ; phonemic dictionary data is viewed as a representative corpus over which to extract n- gram phonemic frequencies in the language  . Dictionary data are compared to corpus data , and phoneme inventories arc evaluated for coverage  . A methodology is defined to compute I ) honemic ngrams for incorporation into a TTS system . 
1 Introduction
The majority of speech synthesis systems use two techniques : concatenation and formant -synthesis  . Building a comprehensive and intelligible concatenative-based peech synthesis ystem relies heavily on the successfid choice of concatenative units  . Our results contribute to the t~sk of developing an eificient and elfective methodology for reducing the potentially large set of concaten -live units to a manageable size  , and to chosing the optimal set for recording and storage  . 
The paper is aimed primarily at two audiences : one consists of those concerned with research on the automatic use of MR  . D data ; the other are TTS system designers who require linguistic and lcxicographic resources to improve and streamline system-building  . Issues of morphological nalysis and generation , as well as stress assigmnent based on diction a . ry data , are discussed . 
2 Using MRDs in Text to

Several problems are addressed in this paper ; one concern stile subtle comple?itics and idiosyncrasies ilwolve diu parsing dictionaries and extracting data  . Added to this is the lack of consistency both within the same dictionary and across dictionaries which often requires ad hoc procedures for each-resource  . Another issue relates to tile structure of the modules of a TTS system  , specifically ill the grapheme-to-phoneme component  ; dictionary lookup depends on several factors including size  , machine power and storage , factors that have important consequences for the extraction of concatenative nnits  . Another consideration concernstile nature of the language itself : a language with irregular  graphcme4o-phoneme ap-ping and lexically determined stress assignment  ( such as English ) benefits r nost from the large exception list which a dictionary can provide  , There is also the practical issue of dictionary availability  , and of pronunciation field accuracy within an available dictionary  . Thus , decisions on the use of MRD data depend on many factors  , and can significantly impact efficiency and accuracy of a speech system  . 
Since a dictionary entry consists of several fields of information  , naturally , each will bcuse-rid for different applications \[1\]  . Among the standard fields are prommciation , etymology , sub-jcct field notes , definition fields , synonym and antonym cross references , semantic and syntactic comments , run-on forms , conjugational class and inflectional information where relevant  , and translation for the I ) ilingual dictionaries . Each of these fields has proven use fifl for different applications  , such as for building semantic taxouomies\[3\] , \[13\] and machine translation \[12\] . The most directly useflfl for TTS is the pronunciation field  \[4\]  ,  \[11\] . 
Equally use fifl for TTS , but less dir 6ctly acces-class information , and part-of-speech . 1 To illustrate , the following partial entries from Webster's Seventh  ( W7 ) \[15\] illustrate typical pronunciation , definition , and run-on fields : ( l ) ha . yen /' h . ~-v0n/1: II An BOR , POLO'2:a place of safety : ASYLUM haven vt ( 2 ) bi . son/'brs-on,'t>iz-/n . . . 
(3)ho.m ,, . ge.neous/-'j~-ne-0s,-ny0s/...
(4) den . tic . u . late/den-'tik-y0-1~t/orden . tic . u . lat . ed/- , lat-od/aj The entry for " haven " contains one f nll pronunciation  . The entry for " bis on " has one alternative , but the user must figure out that the/on/ should be appended after ' t  ) \] z -/ , as in the first pro-mmciation , in order to obtain the correct variation . Correct pronunciation for " homogeneous " relies on the pronunciation of the previous entry  , " homogeneity " , and requires the user to separate and bring the prefix " homo -" from one entry to another  . To complicate matters , the alternative pronunciation for the suffix/n6 . -as/-nyas/must also be correctly interpreted by the user  . Finally , " dentieulate " has a morphologically related run -onform " denticulated " intile early part of the entry  , and the pronunciation of that run-on is related to the main entry  , but the user must decide how to strip and append the given syllables  . 
2 While these types of reasoning are not difficult for humans  , for whom the dictionary was written , they are quite difficult for programs , and thus are not straighforward to perform automatically  . 
2.1 Using the MRD pronunciation field
Extracting the prommciation field from an MRD is one of the most obvious uses of a dictionary  . Nevertheless , parsing dictionaries in general can be a very complex operation  ( \[16\] ) and even the extraction of one field , such as prommciation , can pose problems . Similar to W7 , in the Robert French dictionary\[9\] , which contains about 89 , 000 entries , several pronunciations can be given for a head word and the choice of one must be made  . Moreover , because of the rich morphology of French 1 Notice , however , that the fifll Collins Spanish-English dictionary  \[7\]  , as opposed to the other bilinguals , does not contain any prommciatloniformation . Although this is rather surprising taking into account that the smaller ver-si  .   .   .   .   .   . has the paper back and g . . . . (\[8\], \[ lO \]) do 1 .   .   .   .   . 
phonetic field , it could be attributed to the fact that pro -mmciation miles in Spanish are relatively predictable  . 
\ [2\] reports on the need to resyllablfy entries already syllabified in LDOCE  \[18\]  , since syllable boundaries for written forms usually reflect hyphenation conventions  , rather than phonologically motivated syllabification conventions necessary for pronunciation  . 
which has a rough ratio of eight morphologically inflected words for one baseform  , Robert lists only the noninflected forms of the lexical entries  . Itow-ever , if pronunciation varies during inflection of nouns and adjectives  , the pronunciation field reflects that variation which makes the information difficult to extract automatically  . For example , in (5) and (6) , one needs to know the nature of the rule to apply in order to relate both forms of the adjective  . 
(5) blanc , blanche/bl ~, blbJ '/ adj , etn.
(6) vif , rive/vif , viv/adj , etn.
In (5) , the masculine/bl~/is obtained by removing the phoneme/J '/ from the feminine/bl ~  , j '/ ( blanche , " white ") . In (6) , the form masculine for nr/vif/("sharp , qnick " ) is formed by stripping the affix/ve/and substituting the phoneme / f /  . 
Notice that tile rules are different in nature , the first being a addition/deletion relation , and the second being a substitution . 
In this project , the dictionary pronunciation field was used to start building the phonetic inventory of a speech synthesis ystem  . For the French TTS system\[?\] , the set of diphones was established by taking most of the thirty-flve phonemes for French and coupling them with each other  ( 352 = 1225 pairs )  . Then , the diphones were extracted from the pronunciation field for head words in the Robert dictionary  . A program was written to search through the dictionary phonetic field and select the longest word where the phoneme pairs would be in mid -syllable position  . For example , the phonemic pair/lo/was found in the pronunciation f  ield/zoolo3ik/corresponding to the head word zoologiquc " zoologic . " Out of 1225 phonemic pairs ,   874 words were fonnd with at least one occurence of the pair  . 
The pair \[ head word_orth , head word_phon\]was extracted and head word_orth was placed in a carrier sentence for recording  . For instance , the speaker would utter the following sentence : " C'estzo-ologique quejedis " where " C'est  . . . quejed is " is the carrier sentence . Due to the lack of explicit inflectional information for nmms and adjectives  , only the noninflected forms of the entries were extracted during dictionary lookup for building tile diphone table  . Similarly for verbs , only the infinitive forms were used since the dictionary does not list the inflected forms as head words  . This exemplifies the most simple way to use pronunciation field data  , which we have completed . A pronunciation list of around 85 , 7 96 phonetic words was obtained from the originalist of a hnost  89  , 000 entries , i . e . 96% of the entries . The remaining 4% consist primarily of prefixes and suffixes which are listed in the dictionary without pronunciations  , ease . 
2.2 Using the MRD for morphology
Even though an MRI ) may not list complete in-tlectional paradigms , it contains useful inflectional information . For example in the Collins Spanish-English dictionary  , verb entries are listed with an index pointing to the conjugation chess and table  , listed at the end of the dictionary . Using this infermation , a finite-state transducer for morphological analysis and generation was built for Spanish  \[20\]  . 
From the original list of over 50 , 000 words , a few million words have been generated . These forms can then be used a stile input to the grapheme-to-phoneme conversion module  , in ; tSpanish TTS system . 
2.3 Using Run-on's
A run-on is defined as a morphological variant of a head word  , included in the entry . Run-on's are problematic data in MRI ) s\[16\] , and they can be found nearly anywhere in the entry  . In example (4) , the run-on occurs at the beginning of the entry , and consists of a fitll form with suffix . More commonly , run-on's occur towards the end of the entry , and tend to consist of predictables uttix a-tion , that is , class II or neutral suttixes \[19\] , such as : hess , dy , or-er , ~sin : (7) sharp adj . . . . sharp . lyadv sharp . hessn (8) suc . ces . sionn . . . . suc . ces . sion . aladjsnc . ces . sion . al . lyadvIn cases where stress is changed with class I non-neutral sultixes  , a separate prououneiation is given as in : (9) gy . ro . scope/'ji-ra-,skSp/n .   .   .   . 
gy . ro . scop . ie/ji-ra-'sk~p-ik/adj-gy . ro . s('ol , . i . cal . ly/d-k ( a - ) le/adv The run-on form with part-of-speech is given in  . -side the entry , so it could be used for morphologi . -eel analysis , tIowever , since protonelation is usually predictable from the head word  ( i . e . there is usually no stress change , and if there is a change , this is explicitly indicated ) the run-on pronunciation often consists of a truncated form  , requiring some logic for reconstruction of the entire pronunciation  . Again , this may be obvious to the human user , but rather complex to tigure out by l ) rogram . 
' l'hus , the run-on may bensefld for In or plology , but is not ms useful h ) rautomatic pronunciation extraction . 
3 Methodology and Results 3 . 1 Collecting Data As stated al ) ove , out of a hnost 89 , 000 head words in the dictionary , 874 phonemic pairs , which represents 71% of the total , were found . This is due to the fact that ( a ) the lookup occurs only on non:inflected words , thus a limited sample of the language ,   ( b ) because the dictionary consists of a list of isolated words  , it does notace on nt for inter : word boundary phenomena  . Sitme Frenchlia is on plays such all important role in tile phonology of French  , a look at phonetic data from a corpus mnst begiw 'n in order to achievef nll coverage  .

For the sake of comparison , both the phonetic transcrip : tion from the corpus and the one from the MRI  ) were converted into a unique set of i ) honemes .

This remains to be tested in the TTS system . 
3.2 Related Work
Although the statistical analysis of MRDs has focussed primarily on definitions and translations  , \[5\] used the prommciation field as data . A dictionary of over 110 , 000 entries containing 51 , 219 common words and 59 , 625 proper nouns ,   \[17\] was used for selecting candidate units that were further utilized in the set of concatenative units  ( di-phones , triphones , and longer milts ) for synthesis . The phonemic string was split according to ten language-dependent segmentation principles  . For example , the word " abacus"\['ab-o-kos\]was first transformed into cuttable units as follows : \[#' a  , '~b , bo , ok , ko , os , s#\] . Once each dictionary word was split , the duplicates were removed and the remaining units formed the set of concatenative units  . At the end of this operation , a rather long list was obtained that was pruned by method such as reduction of secondary and primary stress into one stress in order to keep only one+stress/-stress distinction  . Techniques were shown that allow the selection of a minimal set of word pairs for interword junctures  ; every candidate unit inside and across word sequence was included  . The same strategy was replicated on the Collins Spanish-English dictionary by  \[6\]  . In this fashion , the dictionary was used as a sample of the language in the sense that it assnmes that most of the phonemi combinations of the language were present  .

Miabltikst * 4 Limitations of MRDs The most straightforward way  , but in the long run not then lost flexible , is to parse the phonetic information out of the prommciation field  . The ) ronunciation field information can generally be ~ on sulted by a TTS system within the grapheme-  ; o-phoneme module . Additional rules for pro-:esses such as interword assimilation  , juncture , md prosodic contouring need to be added , since solated word pronunciation couhlal ready be ban-tied by lookup table  . Although appealing , there ~ retwomaj or drawbacks to this approach :   ( a ) dictionary pronunciation fields are often not ) honetically finegrained enough for acceptable speech output  . For example , the pronunciation for " in quest " is given ill W7 as /' in- , kwest / , but of course then as alwill assimilate in place to the velar  , giving/i0-kwest / . Without assimilation , the perceptual cffect is of two words : " in quest " and would be misleading  . Again , the human user will a . ssimilat cnaturally , but a text to speech system must figure out such details  , since artieulator yease is not a factor in most synthesis ystems  . One way to solve this problem is to impose such assimilation on input from the pronunciation field by a set of postprocessing rules  . Although this solution wouht be correct in the majority of cases  , blanket application of such rules is not always appropriate for lexical exceptions  . For example , assimilation is optional for words like " uncaring "  , in this case related to the morphological structure of the lexical item  . A TTS system will probably already have snch rules since they are inherent in the graphemc-to -phoneme approach  . Thus , it could be argued that there is no need for the dictionary prommciation  , since with a complete and comprehensive grapheme -to-phoneme conversion system  , a list which requires postprocessing is simply inadequate and unnecessary  . T iffs is the approach taken , for example , by\[14\] , who makes use of small word lists ( the main dictionary being 25K stored forms ) and several affix tables to recognize graphemic forms  , which arc then transformed into phonemic reprcsentations  ;   ( b ) only a small percentage of possible words are listed with prommciations in a dictionary  . For example , Wcbster's Sev cnth contains about 70 , 000 head words , but is missing words like " computer-ize " and " computerization " since they came into frequent use in the language after the  1963 publication date . Two solutions to this problem present themselves . One is to expand the word list from tile dictionary to include run-on's  , as illustrated in examples (3) and (4) , and discussed in Section 2 . 3 . 
The other is to build a morphological generator , formation as input , discussed in Section 2 . 2 that would be invoked when the word does not tigure in tl  , ehead word list . 
5 Final Remarks
Although limitations ( ' l carly constrain the use of MRI ) s in TTS , we have demonstrated in this paper that it is more cost eflq cient to post process underspecilie  ( l dictionary information such as inflection , pronunciation , and part-of-speech , rather than generate rules from scratch to arrive at the same endpoint  . For speech synthesis , thc data is not always perfect , and often must be postprocessed . This paper h ~ us demonstrated ways we have successfully used dictionary data in ' FTS systems  , ways w c have postprocessed data to make it morc useful  , and ways data Ca mlot bceasily postprocessed or used  . 
Of course , for any TTS system , the power of the dictionary data can be found at the lexical  , t ) h r m q a l , and idiom level . Although any word list such , -Ls a dictionary is by definition closed , whereas language is open-ended , dictionary data has proven to be use fid from both a theoretical and practical point of view  .
