Problems of German-English Automatic Translation
Paul O . Samuels dor ff
I . Aims and method
The aim of any Automatic Translation project is to give 
a mechanical procedure for finding an equivalent expression in the target  lan6uage for any sentence in the source lan6uage   . The aim of any lin6uistic translation project is to find the corresponding structures of the languages dealt with  . With both of the seaims in mind , the empirical method was adopted in the project describ-ed in this paper  . 
2. Structure of the dictionar 7
Two dictionaries are needed : an idiomatic dict io ~ and a lexical dictionary  . Both have next to each English entry the Gex~an equivalent  ( or equivalents ) and the syntactic and semantic information needed for producing a correct German sentence  ( and for choosing the correct equivalent , if necessary ) . The lexlcal dictionary may , for technical reasons , be subdivided into a dictionary for words of high frequency and a dictionary for words of low frequency  . 
3 . Syntactic Problems 3 . 1 . Morphological problems : choosin 6 the correct German suffixes . 
3 . 2 . I ~ x loo18~cal problems : choosing the correct German article , pronoun or relative pronoun . 
3 . 3- Word order : f ind ing the cor rec t s t ruc ture of German  word-8~oups and sentences for the corresponding English structure  . 
~ . Semantic Problems ~ . I . Solvable problems : the correct German equivalent of an ambiguous English word may be found by test in  6 the environment . 
4 . 2 . Partially solvable problems : the correct German equivalent can only be found by approximation  . Possible solutions will be suggested . 
5-Examples
Examples will be given to all of the above problems  .
