Abstract
This paper describes a parameter estimation method for multilabel classification that does not rely on approximate inference . It is known that multilabel classification involving label correlation features is intractable , because the graphical model for this problem is a complete graph . Our solution is to exploit the sparsity of features , and express a model structure for each object by using a sparse graph . We can thereby apply the junction tree algorithm , allowing for efficient exact inference on sparse graphs . Experiments on three data sets for text categorization demonstrated that our method increases the accuracy for text categorization with a reasonable cost.
1 Introduction
This paper describes an exact inference method for multilabel classification ( Schapire and Singer , 2000; Ghamrawi and McCallum , 2005), into which label correlation features are incorporated.
In general , directly solving this problem is computationally intractable , because the graphical model for this problem is a complete graph . Nevertheless , an important characteristic of this problem , in particular for text categorization , is that only a limited number of features are active ; i.e ., nonzero , for a given object x . This sparsity of features is a desirable characteristic , because we can remove the edges of the graphical model when no corresponding features are active . We can therefore expect that a graphical model for each object is a sparse graph . When a graph is sparse , we can apply the junction tree algorithm ( Cowell et c ? 2008.

al ., 1999), allowing for efficient exact inference on sparse graphs.
Our method is evaluated on three data sets for text categorization ; one is from clinical texts , and the others are from newswire articles . We observe the tradeoff between accuracy and training cost , while changing the number of label correlation features to be included.
2 Multilabel Classification
Given a set of labels , L = { l | L | }, multilabel classification is the task of assigning a subset y ? L to a document x . In the framework of statistical machine learning , this problem can be formulated as a problem of maximizing a scoring function ?: y ? = argmax y ?( x , y ) = argmax y ?( f(x , y )). (1) As is usually the case in statistical machine learning , we represent a probabilistic event , ? x , y ?, with a feature vector , f(x , y ) = ? f | f | ( x , y )?. In text categorization , most effective features represent a frequency of a word w in a document ; i.e ., f l,w ( x , y ) = { c x ( w ) if l ? y , 0 otherwise , where c x ( w ) is a frequency of w in x.
The most popular method for multilabel classification is to create | L | binary classifiers , each of which determines whether or not to assign a single label ( Yang and Pedersen , 1997). However , since the decision for each label is independent of the decision for other labels , this method cannot be sensitive to label correlations , or the tendency of label cooccurrences.
A recent research effort has been devoted to the modeling of label correlations . While a number of approaches have been proposed for dealing with label correlations ( see Tsoumakas and intuitively-appealing method is to incorporate features on two labels into the model ( Ghamrawi and McCallum , 2005). The following label correlation feature indicates a cooccurrence of two labels and a word : f l,l ? , w ( x , y ) = { c x ( w ) if l , l ? ? y , 0 otherwise.
3 A Method for Exact Inference
A critical difficulty encountered in the model with label correlation features is the computational cost for training and decoding . When features on every pair of labels are included in the model , its graphical model becomes a complete graph , which indicates that the exact inference for this model is NP-hard . However , not all edges are necessary in actual inference , because of the sparsity of features . That is , we can remove edges between l and l ? when no corresponding features are active ; i.e ., f l,l ? , w ( x , y ) = 0 for all w . In text categorization , when feature selection is performed , many edges can be removed because of this characteristic.
Therefore , our idea is to enjoy this sparsity of features . We construct a graphical model for each document , and put edges only when one or more features are active on the corresponding label pair.
When a graph is sparse , we can apply a method for exact inference , such as the junction tree algorithm ( Cowell et al , 1999). The junction tree algorithm is a generic algorithm for exact inference on any graphical model , and it allows for efficient inference on sparse graphs . The method converts a graph into a junction tree , which is a tree of cliques in the original graph . When we have a junction tree for each document , we can efficiently perform belief propagation in order to compute argmax in Equation (1), or the marginal probabilities of cliques and labels , necessary for the parameter estimation of machine learning classifiers , including perceptrons ( Collins , 2002), and maximum entropy models ( Berger et al , 1996).
The computational complexity of the inference on junction trees is proportional to the exponential of the tree width , which is the maximum number of labels in a clique , minus one.
An essential idea of this method is that a graphical model is constructed for each document . Even when features are defined on all pairs of labels , active features for a specific document are limited . When combined with feature selection , this # train # test # labels card.

A weakness of this method comes from the assumption of feature sparseness . We are forced to apply feature selection , which is considered effective in text categorization , but not necessarily for other tasks . The design of features is also restricted in order to ensure the sparsity of features.
4 Experiments 4.1 Experimental Settings
We evaluate our method for multilabel classification using three data sets for text categorization.
Table 1 shows the statistics of these data . In this table , ? card .? denotes the average number of labels assigned to a document.
cmc2007 is a data set used in the Computational Medicine Center ( CMC ) Challenge 2007 ( Pestian et al , 2007)1. This challenge aimed at the assignment of ICD-9-CM codes , such as cough and pneumonia , to clinical free texts . It should be noted that this data is controlled , so that both training and test sets include the exact same label combinations , and the number of combinations is 90.
This indicates that this task can be solved as a classification of 90 classes . However , since this is an unrealistic situation for actual applications , we do not rely on this characteristic in this work.
reuters10 and reuters90 are taken from the Reuters-21578 collection,2 which is a popular benchmark for text categorization . This text collection consists of newswire articles , and each document is assigned topic categories , such as grain and ship . We split the data into training and test sets , according to the socalled ModApte split.

Table 3: Accuracy for cmc2007, reuters10, and reuters90 From this data , we create two data sets . The first set , reuters10, is a subset of the ModApte split , to which the 10 largest categories are assigned.
The other , reuters90, consists of documents that are labeled by 90 categories , having at least one document in each of the training and test sets.
In the following experiments , we run two machine learning classifiers : Bayes Point Machines ( BPM ) ( Herbrich et al , 2001), and the maximum entropy model ( ME ) ( Berger et al , 1996). For BPM , we run 100 averaged perceptrons ( Collins , 2002) with 10 iterations for each . For ME , the orthant-wise quasi-Newton method ( Andrew and Gao , 2007) is applied , with the hyper parameter for l We use word unigram features that represent the frequency of a particular word in a target document . We also use features that indicate the non-existence of a word , which we found effective in preliminary experiments ; feature f l,w ? ( x , y ) is 1 if l ? y and w is not included in the document x.
Words are stemmed and number expressions are normalized to a unique symbol . Words are not used if they are included in the stopword list (322 cmc2007 ? max . width avg . width time ( sec .) 0 0 0.00 90 100 2 1.17 132 200 3 1.51 145 400 3 1.71 165 800 4 2.11 200 1600 5 2.93 427 3200 4 3.99 2280 reuters10 ? max . width avg . width time ( sec .) 0 0 0.00 787 500 2 1.72 1378 1000 3 2.00 1752 2000 4 2.16 2594 4000 6 2.90 7183 8000 6 4.22 21555 16000 6 5.67 116535 reuters90 ? max . width avg . width time ( sec .) 0 0 0.00 26172 500 5 1.74 28067 1000 6 2.24 38510 2000 6 3.22 42479 4000 8 3.68 60029 8000 14 4.56 153268 16000 17 6.39 ?

We set c = 5 for reuters10 and reuters90, following previous works ( Ghamrawi and McCallum , 2005), while c = 0 for cmc2007, because the data is small.
These features are selected according to averaged mutual information ( information gain ), which is the most popular method in previous works ( Yang and Pedersen , 1997; Ghamrawi and McCallum , 2005). For each label , features are sorted according to this score , and top-ranked features are included in the model . By preliminary experiments , we fixed parameters , ? for word unigram features and ? for non-existence features , for each data set , as shown in Table 2.
The same method is applied to the selection of label correlation features . In the following experiments , we observe the accuracy and training time by changing the threshold parameter ? for the selection of label correlation features.

The results also demonstrate that the accuracy saturates , or even decreases , with large ?. This indicates that the feature selection is necessary not only for obtaining efficiency , but also for higher accuracy.
Table 4 shows tree widths , and the time for the training of the ME models . As shown , the graphical model is represented effectively with sparse graphs , even when the number of label correlation features is increased . With these results , we can conclude that our method can model label correlations with a tractable cost.
The accuracy for cmc2007 is significantly better than the results reported in Patrick et al (2007) ( micro-F1=81.1) in a similar setting , in which only word unigram features are used . Our best result is approaching the results of Crammer et al (2007) ( micro-F1=84.6), which exploits various linguistically motivated features . Numerous results have been reported for reuters10, and most of them report the microaveraged Fscore around 91 to 94, while our best result is comparable to the state-of-the-art accuracy . For reuters90, Ghamrawi and McCallum (2005) achieved an improvement in the microaveraged Fscore from 86.34 to 87.01, which is comparable to our result.
5 Conclusion
This paper described a method for the exact inference for multilabel classification with label correlation features . Experimental results on text categorization with the CMC challenge data and the Reuters-21578 text collection demonstrated that our method improves the accuracy for text categorization with a tractable cost . The availability of exact inference enables us to apply various machine learning methods not yet investigated in this paper , including support vector machines.
From the perspective of machine learning research , feature selection methods should be reconsidered . While we used a feature selection method that is widely accepted in text categorization research , it has no direct connection with machine learning models . Since feature selection methods motivated by the optimization criteria of machine learning models have been proposed ( Riezler and Vasserman , 2004), we expect that the integration of our proposal with those methods will open up a new framework for multilabel classification.
