flY " , and "& i ~" ( jinshu : human race ) as their respective quivalencies . Since " . & ~ i \[(" has not l , -ing to do with "~(/ , '" , race is excluded . We call this inethod of looking up ECs in the inverse dictionaries when choosing relevant equivalencies inverse consultation  , and we call the words obtained by looking up inverse dictionaries the selection area  ( SA )  . Inverse consultation utilizes the . 
structure of dictionaries to measure the nearness of the meanings of words in  ( t iff > rent languages . 
The simplest application of inverse consultation is to use Dic ~_  , ~ . In the above example , each EC is looked up in Dict_ , e and the results are compared with the English equivalencies of "  ) ~'6""  ( E )  ; namely , competition , contest , and race . The SA of eompd titlon is competition , contest and match , which have tile elements contest and competition in common with E  ( Fig .  2) . As compdtition derived from competition , competition should be put a side , but contest is still left as a common element and thus compdtition is selected as an equivalence of '" ~  ( P "' . As for race , the SA of race consists of race and ancestry , whose intersection with E only gives race ; so race is judged as an inadequate EC . In shorl; , the number of elements in common between the selection area and E indicates the nearness of the meaning between the EC and the original word  . 
For the inverse consultation ( lmseril ) ed above , the SA was in English . If we use Dice ~ j as an inverse dictionary successively afl  ; er consult > ingDic ~ - . e , then the SA is in Japanese an ( 1 we ~ f\[' with the SA ( Fig .  3) . The . SA for e onlpare "''~""

There can beain f in it . e number of inverse ( : on-sultations according to then mnber of ( : on sulte ( 1 inverse ( tietionaries . If the inverse dictionaries arc consulted'n times  , we call the method nti'mes inverse cons ' ultation  . (/ C ', , ) . Which inversed i (: tio-nary to use . does not always have a unique answer . 
For IC2 for example , wentay consul UDi %_** after consulting Dicf . - . e with the SA in French . 
2.2 Selection Procedure
Once the SAt bragive . nwoM is obtained , equiv-Mencies are selected by handling two collections of words  . We (: all this process the selection p'ro-ced . ure . 
One way to do this is to count them nnber of specific element : s in the SA  . For example , if the SA is in Japanesc' , the number of l . he element ""~?~ d@"' itself is counted . Another way is to count how many parts of words ( PWs ) are eont Mnmd in the SA . " ~ a and "?6"\[ or exaulple , the number o\['""'~:" contained in the SA is considered  ( thus "" . . . . . ~ in "~ j ~' ~" iS ; dSO collnl ; ed) . 
If we handle the meaning of words , a third way . v )? . ~ in ; tJapalmseLhesaurnsan ( 1 is to look up ' *'~-" COllar how nlal\]y times the synottynls ai  ) i ) ear in the $ A . For exanq ) le , il ', . is a synonym or . , %, k ~", ~) t . ) ', , then the num l ) e . r of at ) i ) ear:mces of "~ j ~ ~ ( ~' lfi:z"I ~:" is added to that of , g  ~ . If we go further to h ; mdle the meaning , we might as well process words by semantic processing  . 
Since a kanji is an ideogram , the second method also handles the meaning . When 1; 11 os ( , qection area is in English or l " rench , the eorresi ) on ( ting me . tlm(1 is to count morphemes such as " in l ; er " and " national " for the word " int 0 . rnationar ' . W ( ; are interested into what extent he method that does not  (  ; xplicitly concern the meaning may be used to handle theme  , ruing of words , lln ; 11(; for lowing , we . focus on 1; 11(; former two inethods . 
29 B3 Fundamental Concepts 3 . 1 . Harmonized Dictionary A bilingual dictionary forms agr N  ) h whose nodes are words and whose ) ranches are correspondences between the words . Branchc's haw ; directions , which make the graph asymmetric . D : i c . ,(1 , g is a graph with all the tn ' anches inDic >' v in inverse direction  . 
Since the purpose of bilingual dictionaries is to denote the correspondences of words that have the same meaning\[  tIar83\]  , it ; is Iud . ura \] that branches ~ rebidirectional . Wet ; here fore design symmetrical dictionaries and we denote  , a di (: tio-nary from hm guage : c to y as D . . . . u , calling it ; ; t harmonized ictiona'uI . When D, . _  , ,/ and D:j , ~ , are construc ~; e(1fi'om the same dictionaries , D ! t . **=: D Tly holds . We remove the overlaps of branches . 
3.2 Syntactic Selection Procedure
A multise there is a set in which each element : has : ~ weight that is a m ~ turaln m nl  ) er . The weighl ; of ml element is defined as then mnl ) er of times it appears when looking up words in dietiom wies  . 
In the example shown in Fig .  3 , then ml tise tSA~\[(' with weighl ; 2 foreom pdtition('onsists of "" ~ . . . .
and ") j ~ J , hi " with weight 3 . We denote the . weight : of eh ; nlent x in multiset X as ba(X , x ); for instance , 5 ~( SA , ~ e)~-T f ~**~) = 2 . Using the same notation , 5 a(X , Y ) is defined as ibllows when X and
Y are multisets : ~' a(X , Y ) = ~5 a(X , . , ) yCl/When a multiset Z consists of " , , , . , , : zw ) ~ . ) q .   .   .   .   .   . and ma~z,~'~"" the . nG(SA,Z ) = 5 . 
The nol ; ; tl ; ion ~ b(X , X ) represent she sum of the weights of the elements that contain PWs of : cinInultiset X  . For instance . , if PWs are defined as k~mji , 5/ .   .   .   .   . ~a , bLot *, ~ . ~ q ) is 7 by adding 5 ( sum of weights of elements in the SA that have kmti " ~"  ) ~ ul ( l2 ( Slll IIOf weights of elemenl : shtI . he SA that have kanji " q "") . Using ~ lw . same nota-l ; ion , 5 a(X , Y ) is defined as fi ) llows when X ~ md
Y are multisets : eb(X , V ) : : ~ eb(X , v)y ~ Y For instance , 5 b(SA , Z ) = 12; that is 7 plus5(=~b(SA , '~)) . We , , s the . , , t ~ : i , , , , ~ . s ~>- ramet ; er for ~ a or ~5b .

Although there are other ways to symmetrize dictionaries  , ( for example , by removing all branches that are not bidirectional  )  , we chose the above procedm:es for the lexieographical reason described below \[  IlarS3\]  . 
There are two kinds of bilingual dictionaries , one is from , ~ foreign language ( f ) to then m ther language ( Die / . . . . .  ) , and tile other is fi'om amother language\[m ) to a foreign language ( Diem_ , /) . In Dic / . . . . . . when there are no equiv-aleneies in m for a foreign word  , the dictionary gives its definition or explam ~ tion of the word in m  . Therefore , all the foreign words can be contained in the dictionary  . In Dic , r > ~ fontl , e other hand , if there are no equivalencies inf for a word of m  , the word itself is often dropped fl ' om the dictionary  . The words contained in the dictionary are the ref brea part of m  , and Dic . . . . . . . flacks many entries . A harmonize dictionary is a solution t ; oth is problem because it contains equiwdenc , ies of
Dicf_ ., ~ as entries of Diem--,\]'.
4 . 2 Procedure of Inverse Consu l ta t ion lh'om Property  1  , we use 5a wi~h IC1 and we use 5b with IC'2 . The PW for 5b are defined as for lows : ? Japanese 6353 kanjis . 
? French morphemes \[ Mauaa \].
1151 prefix and 710 suffix.
ih ' om Property 2 , inverse consultation is applied to both Japanese and French entries  , and then tile results are put together to construct a harmonized dictionary  . We denote it as Dj ~ to rDf_+j . 
Each entry within Dj-+e and Dt-- , e is classified into one of five types according to the procedure used to select its equivaleneies from ECs  . 
? Type A A single EC exists and is selected unconditionally as the eqnivalence  . 
? Type 13 Equiw deneies 1) y\[CI exist ; all are selected and the rest of the ECs are discarded  . 
? Type C There are no equivalencies by ICt but there are by \[ C  . 2  . One third ( empirically decided ) of ECs by 1C2 arc's elected according to the w due of the following fl'action  ( larger ones are seleet : ed ) :

Of the latter , some examples are listed in Table 5 and 6 . For distique in Table 5 , which is a term in French literature , De~j translates it into the term for the corresponding kind of Japanese literature  . Although it resembles to the direct translation of distique  , it is only an analogy . On the other hand , since the direct translation of distlque in the publishedic-tionary adopts the concept of French imems  , it is uncommon and cannot bemttlers too ( 1 \] ) yiil OS l ; Japanese readers . The same is true for boulier except that the commml Japanese is indicated in a published ictionary  . Pull is borrowed front the English word pull -over whose direct translation is contained in a published dictionary  , and it is not a common word in Japanese . 
In the first example in Table 6 , grive is the generic name equivalent to thrush , whereas merle is a kind of thrush . The second example shows that more equivalencies are found in Dj_d  . 
To sum up , the resulting dictionary can be utilized in conjunction with the published  ( tiction ar-ies as follows : ? To revise the equiw deneies  . 
? To supplement the equivaleneies.

7 Conclusion and Future Works
Thei ) rol ) osed method for using a intermediate hmguage to construct al  ) iling u : d dictionary utilizes the structure of dictionaries and morphemes and can choose appropriate equiw dencies for most  , entries . Comi ) aring the resulting dictionary with publish e ( l dictionaries showed that tiara obtained are useflt l for revising and sUi  ) l ) lementing t . hevocabulary of existing dictionaires . 
To increase the accuracy with which eqniva-h ', ncie . s can be selected , mistakes in word-to-word dictionaries must t ) ecorrected even if ' our method may detect a I ) i ) ropri : ~ tee quiw deneies . One way to do this would bet . ouse thesaurus to cheek whether the extracted eorresi  ) ondences are rele-wmt . 
Nouns were l ; a keu into consideration it iffs research , and the next steI ) will be to apply the proposed method to other parts of speech  . We also need to estat/lish a way to handle compom ~d words in European languages  .
