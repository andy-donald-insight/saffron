Finding useful phrases is important in applications like information retriew d  , and text-to-speech systems . One of the currently most used statistics is the mutual information ratio  . 
This paper compares the mutual information ratio and a measure that takes temporal ordering into account  . Using this lnodified measure , some local syntactic constraints as well as phrases amcaptured  . 

In Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carrel many of Alice's friends have names that consists of two words  , for example : the March Hare , the Mock Turtle , and the Cheshire Cat . 
'\[' he individual words in these combinations , if we ignore capitalisation , might be quite common . 
Individual words usually mean different things when the yam free  . l : or example , in " The March against Apar the id " , and " The March Itare " , " march " means totally different hings . 
There is obviously a strong link between " the " and " march "  , but the link between " march " and " hare " is definitely stronger  , at least in Lt ; w is
Carrol's text.
The goal of this paper is to propose a statistic that measures the strength  ol7 such glue between words in a sampled text . Finding tile names ) 1 7 Alice's friends can be done by searching for two adjacent words with initial capit ~ d letters  . 
( ) no use of statistical associations could he to find translatable concepts and phrases  , that might be expressed with a different number of words in another language  . Another possibly interesting use of statistical associations i to predict whether words constitute new or given information in speech  . It has been proposed ( e . g . Horne & Johansson ,  1993 ) that the stress of words in speech is highly dependent on the informational content of the word  . Also , statistical associations are not incompatible with the first stages of the " hypothesis space " proposed by Processability Theory  ( personal communication with Manfred Pienemann of Sydney University  , see also Meisel & al . , 1981) . 
There are different methods of calculating statistical associations  . Yang & Chute ( 1992 ) showed that a linear least square mapping of natural anguage to canonical terms is both feasible  , and a way of detecting synonyms . Their methodoes not seem to detect dependencies in the order of words however  . To do this we need a measure that is sensitive to the order between words  . In this paper we will use a variant of mutual infi  ) rmation that derives from Shannon's theory of information  . ( as discussed in e . g . ,
Salton & McGill , 1983)
Definitions and assumptions
The definition of a word in a meaning lulway is \[ : ar from easy  , but a working definition , for technical purposes , is to assume that a word equals a string of letters  . These ' words ' are separated by non-letters . The case of letters is ignored , i . e . converted into lower case . For example : " there's " are two ' words':" there " and ~ IS "  . 
A collocation consists of a word and the word that immediate@follows  . Index I will refer to the first word and 2 to the second word . 
Index 12 will refer to word 1 followed by word 2 , and similarly for 2I . 
Another assumption is that natural anguage is morn predictive in the  ( left-to-right ) emporal order , than in tile reversed order . This is moti-wtted by the simple obserwttion that speech comes into the system through the ears serially  . 
For example : consider the French phrase " unben viuhlanc "  ( Lit . " a good wine white ") . 
" Ben " can ( relatively often ) be followed by " vin " , but usually not " vin " by " ben " . The same kind of link exists between " vin " and " bhmc "  , but not between " blanc " and " vin " . 
This linking affects the intonation of French phrases  , and also that intonation supports these kinds of links  . Note , that this is not an explana- . 
tion of either intonation or syntax : we mosl likely have to consider massive interaction be-  . 
tween different modalities of language.

Deriving the measure
The mutual information ratio , g , provides a rough estimation on the glue between words  . It measures , roughly , how much more common a collocation is in a text than can be accounted for by chance  . This measure does not assume any ordering between the words making up a collocation  , in the sense that the g-measure of \[ wl .   .   . w2\] and\[w2 . .  . wl \] are calculated as if they were unrelated collocations  . 
The mutual information ratio ( in Steier &
Belew , 1991) is expressed : ,
Formula 1: The mutual information ratio where ' p'defines the probability function  , p(\[wl .   .   . w2\] ) is read as " the probability of finding word w2 after word wl " . 
Adjusting for order between words
We have experimented with the difference in mutual information  , ag , between the two different orderings of two words making up a collocation  . The results indicate that zxg captures some of the local constraints in a sampled text  . 
6g can be expressed :

I(P (\[ W l . . . W2\])I,(P (\[ W2 . . . W ~ I=>,/,=tog2/----/
Formula 2: The diffcmnce in mutual inlblrnation where F ( \[wx . . . Wy\] ) denotes the frequency of which Wx and Wy cooccur in the sample  . 
F ( wx ) is the frequency of word Wx . Note that the size of the sample cancels in this equation  . 
Note also that this measure is not sensitive to the individual probabilities of the words  . 
A problem is when them is no F(\[w2...wl\]).
In these cases , we have chosen to arbitrarily set F(\[w2 . . . Wl\]) to 0 . 1 , with the justification that if the sample wasten times larger we might have found at least one such pair  . 

The material is Alice's Adventures in
Wonder hmd by Lewis Carrol , available in electronic format via email from the Gutenberg Project  . The text contains 27332 words of which 2576 are unique , making up a total of 14509 unique word pairs . A lice in Wonderland was chosen because it is a wellknown text  , it contain some phrases that we know are in there  ( e . g . March Hare ) , and it contains a sufficient number of words , and variations of words , to be interesting for the experiment . Studies could be done for other collections of texts  , e . g . 
medical abstracts . As morn document sate available , comparisons between documents can be done ( Steier & Belew ,  1991) . This experiment only contains within comparisons of phrases for one specific text  . 

For each of the unique words in the text the fie -quencies of all immediately following words were collected  . In this text , no filtering of the text was performed . Some initial experiments were performed , with a stoplist , to remove function words and some other common words  ( see Fox ,  1992 , for details ) . Some simple stemming was also tried , e . g . removing ' s ' and ' ed ' from the end of words . Stemming may lead to difficulties in distinguishing compounds from noun-verb complexes  . It is not clear if the pros of using stemming outweighs the cons  , consequently we decided to work with the raw text . 
Stoplists and stemming might be more important when the ordinary g-measure is used  . 

The collocations were ordered ifferently by the two measures  . The g was sensitive to individual frequencies , and favoured very low fi'equency collocations . The Ag was sensitive to the ordering of the words  , and favoured high frequency collocations that only occmred in one order  . The quality of the diffemnt measures can be seen by comparing the top and last ten collocations between the measures  . Table 1 . 1 and 2 . 1 refer to Ag , and Table 1 . 2 and 2 . 2 refer to g . The N column tells the rank-number of the collocation  . 
Note that the frequencies of the individual words , F1 and F2 , are not used to compute Ag , they are only provided for compa ~% on with the g -measure  . 
Note that the numerical values of the g-mea-sure and the Ag-measure cannot be directly compared since they measure slightly different phenomena  .

As can be seen from Table 1 . 1 , Abt captures local constraints : that prepositions amusually followed by a noun phrase  , that ' and ' usually is used as a noun coord in a to r  ( indicated by the high value for ' and -> the ' )  . 
Mitjushin ( 1992 ) has proposed similar links on a higher syntactic level  , using a rule-based approach . We have deliberately tried to awfid talking about word-classe since it is misleading at this level of analysis  . However , we get many examples of good representatives for word-classes that form collocations  .

As can be seen from Table 1 . 2 , low individual frequencies result in a high g -value  , even if the collocation is unique . This gives an illusion of a semantic relation , which is due to the fact that low frequency words arc usually high in content  . The g-measure is useful when we are interested in the correlation between words within and between documents  ( Steier & Belew ,  1991) . This notion could be expanded upn to incorporate correlation between any two words in general  , and it seems to work well for the g-measure ( Wettler and
Rapp , 1989).
The last ten collocations . A g is sensitive to deviation from an expected ordering in tile sample  . The negative valued link between these words makes a phrase boundary between the two words probable  .

In the case of " the -> the " there exists 1641 pairs that speak agains that pairing , but it is hard to explain this in terms of local syntactic constraints  . The negative scores seems to capture possible typographic errors  .

Particle verbs
Particle verbs are hard to rank high for the ~ t -measure  , because the individual fl'cquencies of the particles are usually devastatingly high  , ~md the fl'equency of the main verb in pm'ticle verb constructions are usually higher than av -crage  . The Abtare , in gencral , good at finding such combinations if the order between the two words is fixed  ( ' Fable 3 . 1) .

Finding thematic phrases
But what about finding Alice's friends'?Does the art find the phrases that the text is about  ( ~thematic phrases ) ? To test this we chose some of the names of Alice 's friends  ( Table 3 . 2) . 
We found that the rank number that Ag delivers is higher than the rank number for the rt-measure for all the checked friends  . This is due to the frequency effects discussed above  .

What is lost
The ream obviously good phrases that grates higher than zXg  . These usually consists of two words that are uncommon in the sample  . 
Some idioms are of this kind . The at * needs to find more examples of collocations with the exact ordering between the constituents or ate the collocation high  ( Table 3 . 3) . 
Table 3 . 3: Some collocations with Ng < Nag word pair Nbt NAbtrt Artycr -> honour  172   705   12  . 7 5 . 32 young -> lady 2 30 107 312 . 4 4 . 91 guinea -> pigs 3986 45 11 . 6 5 . 32 rose -> tree 4591 114 11 . 3 4 . 91 fast -> a sleep 460 1115 11 . 3 4 . 91 note -> book 462 250 111 34 . 32/raving -> mad 597 2500 ~4 . 32 cheshire -> cats 19254 468\[8 . 23 \[ 3 . 32
Adding memory
We have also done some experiments with adding memory to the method  . A'memory ' could , for example , extend 10 words after each word . All words following within a distance equal to the size of the memory were collected  . 
Adding a memory allowed the model to detect shared information of words that was further apart  ( for example " pack of card ~" or " boots and shoes "  . 
The memory introduced false collocations : e . g . , " grammar -> mouse " . The context was : " Alice though thi , ~" l nust be the right way of speaking to a mouse : she had never done such a thing before  , buts here membered having seen in her brother ~ Latin Grammar  ,  ' , 4 mouse--era mouse--to a mouse--a mouse--O mouse \ ]'" This context gave up to  5 collocations for " grammar " followed by " mouse  "  , and therefore rated " grammar -> mouse " very high  . 
Otherwise , words that happened to be near a word without being statistically related to the word were usually rated low  . The g gave clearly better esults on finding related phrases than the zXg  , with the model with the ' memory ' . 
With the memory , the Abtordered the pairs closer to the original raw-frequency ordering the more ' memory ' was present  . The experiment with the memory was useful because it showed that this was not worth doing for a j  . t , but likely worth doing for g . 

Possible usefulness
The higher sensitivity to local constraints in the temporal ordering could be used in a parser for finding local phrases  . This might also have its implications for language acquisition  . It could be tested if language learners make mistakes that could be explained by the statistical connectivity between words  . Further research is needed on how the measure of connectivity behaves on phrase boundaries  . 
Areas where phrase finding could be useful include : text-to-speech  ( phrase intonation )  , machine translation ( translation of compounds ) , and in information retrieval : phrase transfo~xna -tion of high frequency terms into medium fie -quency telxns with a better discrimination value  ( Salton & McGill ,  1983) . 

The rt-measure is good at estimating lobal correlations in a document or collection of documents  ( Wettler & Rapp ,  1989) . This could be used for capturing contextual and pragmatic constraints in a text  . Other methods exist that are good , perhaps even better , at capturing for example synonymy . 

Linear least square mapping ( Yang & Chute 1992 ) is one method that has shown to bcpromising on capturing very good mappings between  , in their case , symptoms and diagnosis . 
The same technique could be used for mapping a text to its abstract  . The drawback of these methods is their inherent parallel structure which makes it hard to account for the ordering that n at m ' allanguage requires  . 
The Ag-measure , on the other hand , is a local measure , that seems to capture dependencies in the temporal ordering of the language  . It is hard to draw any definite conclusions from the analysis of only one text  , but we have seen how the two proposed measures react  1o the frequencies of individual words , as well as the frequencies of word pairs . Taking into account the ability o1' Abt to find dependencies in the temporal ordering  , we think it is a more relevaut measure than I-t for several aspects of natural language processing  , but not all .
