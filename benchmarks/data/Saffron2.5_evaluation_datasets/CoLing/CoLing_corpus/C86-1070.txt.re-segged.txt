I wish to put the theory and metatheory currently
adopted in the Eurotra project ( Arno O6 ) into a historical perspective , indicating where and why changes to its basic design for a transfer-based MT  ( TBMT ) system have been made . 
Let T . be some theory of representation , inducing sets of representations R ~ and Rt for languages L  , , and L ~ ( seen as sets of texts ) , respectively . 
Transfer-based translation is described as follows: 


R~~...................
I:GEN
L~-..................L ~
TRA where AN , BEN and TRF are binary relations , and TRA is the composition of AN , TRF and GEN , i . e . 
interpretation was to be expressed as an orbered tree with complex property lists on the nodes  , which was manipulated by two basic operations , viz . tree transformations and lexical substitution . The BETA preoccupation with robustness , on the other hand , made them require that all linguistic information about texts should be merged into one single gds  . On failure to compute parts of a deeper linguistic dimension  , the intuition went , some clever algorithm could be used to extract from the gds an equivalent piece of representation on the next less pretentious dimension  . The logical extreme of this reasoning was that , if all else failed , it should be possible to recover the original text from the gds  . 
Grenoble , however , had perceived the usefulness of dependency theory  ( DT ) for TBNT . "\[ here is a sense in which DT is a lexically oriented theory of language  , and , in the end , translation is a question of getting the right translation for words  . 
Nevertheless , the marriage between DT and the gds design led to  ( I ) procrustinated linguistics , and (2) a formalism with untractable semantics .

Otherwise , a theory is monostratal,
A theory T is mult !_ dim_ebsional when descriptions of linguistic objects along several linguistic dimensions are merged into one single representational mbject  . The notion of linguistic dimension is meant to correspond to some organising principle for a theory of representation  ( e . g . 
constituency , grammatical relations , logical semantics , ate . l . Otherwise , a theory is monodimensional . 
In what follows we describe the various Eurotra approaches to TBMT in terms of this basi ~ model  , Initially , due to its BETA inheritance , Eurotra adhered to a monostratal multidimensional model for TBMT  . Computationally , it was based on the Grenoble formalism of the g~n ~ E  ~ ateu_rd ~  . _st Euctur ~ s(g . ds) . 
Linguistically , it advocated a diluted form of dependency theory as a basis for TBMT  . 
The observation that theoretical linguistics had been incapable of providing a practically applicable basis for translation hadled Greno Ole to build almost no linguistic commitment into the gds formalism  . Every possible form of linguistic 294 . 
\] he innovation of \[ Arno83\] was its attempt to derive requirements on T . from a set of more abstract principles , seen as a theory of MT providing a framework within which possible substantive theories for TBMT could be devised and compared  . The weakness of the framework was to seek to motivate the tools inherited from BETA aposteriori  . Its merit was to be a partial theory of TBMT , independent of the inheritance . 
Its major concern was directed at elucidating the division of labour between AN  , TRF and OEN , and at deriving implications on T . from this understanding . 
The pivotal principles of the framework that have survived the many facelifts of the Eurotra model are isoduidy_andQ-d~E~D  ~  . g ! 2 . 
The principle of isoduiy allowed for a principled definition  , in terms of properties of T ,  . , of the domain of the GEN relation of some language in terms of the no domain of the AN relation for that same language  , thus indirectly defining . the TRF relation . 
The principle of O-differentiation required that T . 
should be sufficiently expressive to ensure that all meaning aspects of text that are relevant for translation  ( called ' Q' ) be represented in members of R . The two principles together " provided a basis for designing a transfer device that was  ( i ) developmentally simple , and (2) Q-preserving . These are necessary features of any multilingual TBMT systems triving for good-quality translation  . 
1.2. ~ lultidimensior , al.
Despite its success in providing an initial framework for Eurotra  ,   lame83\] failed dismally when it came to deriving from i t a substantive linguistic representation theory  . The failure was not unrelated to the absence of motivation for the GETA vestiges  . 
The gds comprised a flat geometry and a rich decoration on the nodes  . Given the requirement of merging , th ~ geometry for all dimensions ( text string , morphology , surface syntax , deep syntax , semantics ) had to be very similar : this was only possible by making the geometry quite meaningless  , and by putting the whole expressive burden on the labelling of nodes  . The need to preserve surface word order ( robustness ) gave geometry its only interesting task : the representation of word order through the ordering of sister nodes  , Within a merged approach , this requirement led to the arbitrary interdependence of the subtheorios for the various linguistic dimensions  . The problem was most tangible in the design of a subtheory of \]'  , , for a semantic dimension . T  ~ , became unnecessarily complex and inconsistent . Given the absence of linguistic ~ ommitments built into the tools and the failure of the framework to answer substantive linguistic questions  , debates about the relative merits of particular representational choices wore inconclusive  . 
We give an example of linguistic procrustination , Surface word order being represented by the order of sister nodes in the merged tree  ( the gds )  , tree geometry was seen as ordered . T in s geometry of dependency representations , on the ether hand , are normally unordered , Tile way out was are fashioning of DT as a compromise between DT and X-theory with a single bar : a subset of the information about the governing node was lowered into them db tree representing its dependents and to require that the subtree he ordered conforming to the position o ~ elements in the input text  , lbi ~ worked badly with all sorts of difficult linguistic phenomena : exocentri  ( : constructions ( e . g . ~ on juection ) , gapoing , discontinuity , long-distance dependencies , etc . Much of the linguistic research , then , was aimed at overcoming these problems in a principled way by means of a theory of empty elements  . Although the latter was intuitively consistent , it caused such an increase in the complexity of the formalism that the latter defied any coherent formal characterisation  . 
The first design was , amongst other things , unable to flesh out the problem of robustness , Combining a muitidimensienal representation with ab~sically all paths combinatorial algoritbmled to the inability to rely on the actual computation of combinations of information required by the safety netalor ithm  . 
The second deuign ( which was never formally accepted by the project ) purported to solve this problem , without eliminating multidimeneion-alit v . It was multistratal and multidimensional . 
2.1. Rultistr~tal.
It was observed that the representations induced by T  , , had to meet two ( possibly conflicting ) requirements : ( i ) they had to have sufficient expressive power to allow for adequate translation via simple transfer  , and (2) their computation had to be feasible . As a consequence , T . was split into two subtheories , T ~ and T ~ , were the former was directed at the needs of adequacy for simple transfer and the latter to the reliability of presence of a consistent representation from which either the more pretentious T ~ representation was reached or  , alternatively , translation vialess . -simple transfer was possible . The model that emerged was the following :

AN~ITR FFIGEN ~
ANR . / f . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . R~:zfGEN
AN ~ IIGENF

The motivation . \ [ or this design hinged on ( i ) the fact that the f-stratum could make use of know-how in computational linguistics  ,   ( 2 ) the f-stratum was a good starting point for innovative research on what T ~  . stlould be for multiling oal TBMT ,   ( 3 ) the model gave content to the notion of safety nets  ( rm bostness )  , (4) developmental issues , The claim made was that with a monolithic l .   , the formulation of safety nets is hindered hythe hybridity prohlem ~ their ' input domain coold be any unpredictable mombination offeasibly computable and adequate information on several dimensions in the gds  . \] he new design provided the f-stratum as a more reliable basis for ' safe safety nets  . 
2.2. Hultidi~nsio ~ aI.
This feature of the design did not change , Instead of one multidimensional representation , we now had two , No further attempt was mm de , however , to justify the use of multidimensional representations  . 
Given the rejection of theoretical modularity on the basis of considerations of reliability of computation  , the only course to take seemed to be to abandon the multidimensional view itself and to let the strata themselves v  , e presenh linguistic dimensions . The new model became multistratal and monodimensional  ,  3 . 1 . khlltistratal . 
T , , was described as a sot of iodependently defined subtheories for " representing normalised text  ( no )  , morphology(me ) , surface syntax(ss ) , deep syntax ( dm ) and semantics ( sem) , They were concogtumlly related to each other , however , by being based on a common central notion of dependency defined in terms of slot filling and modification  , A strength of this move is that linguistics in Eurotra could now profit from linguistic work in the outside world  , The proposal suffered , l ' lowever ~ from the absence of a clear view on what sorts of dedicated operations were needed to actually map between arbitrarily different dependency trees  . Nor we reconsiderations of the computational complexity of arbitrary tree-transformation formalisms taken into account in the definition of the level o  , A proposal to relate all these levels to each other by giving them all a lexicalist underpinning was rejected by the C  , E . C . 
Finally , a stratificatienal strategy was imposed on the makers of the design  , with the ( unjustified ) intuition that it would provide a basis for the incorporation of safety nets into the model  . 

The model now roughly looked as follows ( with question marks indicating undefined parts ) :

TRA 3.2. Mono dimensional.
Representations reflect only one linguistic dimension : the gds approach was completely abandoned  . 
The theories identified described the representation of normalised text strings  , the internal structure of words , the surface dependency , the canonical dependency and the semantic dependency of the input texts  . 
4 . The  #resent desi~_LCde~T85jA\[!oB6\]? The properties of the current Eurotra design constitute the topic of Arnold & des Tombe's paper in this volume  . Here , Imerely relate it to previous hypotheses about the Eurotra translation model  , The design is multistrata \] and monodimensional and can be depicted as follows: 

Gm/ntG~/mo ~ / cm~m/r ~ G*X ~ emtext . < -> nt . <-> me . <-> cs . <-> re . (-> sem . 
TRF text , < -> nt ~<-> mo ~<-> cst <-> rs ~<- ) sem~t t t t t

GEN 4.1. Multistratal.
Each stratum corresponds to an autonomous generating device for a representation language  , Each generator consists of a set of atoms and a set of constructors that together allow for the generation of L  ( 8 )  , a set of formally wellformed derivation trees . The latter are then evaluated ( by unification ) to a set of meaning full representations , R(G ) . 
The intuition underlying this model is that translation between atural language texts can be split up into a sequence of more IE~Y ~__  _ translations between elements of adjacent generators  . Adjacent generators must be devised so that the primitive translations that obtain are also simll_e  , This is taken to mean that primitive translations must be  ( i ) compositional and ( 2 ) one-shot . The justification for compositionality is the intuition that the translation of some expression EE's parts and of the way these parts ere put together  , The latter is required to restrain the complexity of this function : the codomain of a primitive translation must always be wellformed in terms of the target generator  , This forbids internal strategy inside translators . 
The project is examining various hypotheses about particular instantiations of this core model : e  . g . 
translators could perform any one of the following four mappings :  ( iderivation to derivation , ( ii ) derivation to representation ,   ( iii ) representation to derivation and ( iv ) representation to representation . Possibility ( i ) was found to be too restrictive . We now study possibility ( iii ) . Note the similarity between ( iv ) and the structural correspondence approach adopted in LFG for mapping between information structures of a different nature  . 
4.2. Monodi ~ ensional.
The current strata envisaged are normalised text , morphology , configurational surface syntax , relational surface syntax and semantics . Morphology is based on work on word grammar as independent of phrase structure grammar  . Configurational syntax draws from the X-theoryl iterature  . Relational syntax representations resemble LFG fstructures  . 
The semantic stratum , finally , is not yet fully specified : this has to do with the very special requirements that translation by means o~simple transfer puts on e semantic representation theory  . 
The point is , however , that the non-semantic levels are claimed to be feasible  ( cfr . f-stratum in 2 ) and that they can thus provide a basis for researching a translation-oriented semantic theory  ,  5 . Conclusion . 
I hope to have slightly lifted the veil that has hidden the Eurotra project from the scienti ficcommunity for a number of years  . It has become clear , hopefully , that the Eurotra design has become more homogeneous and that it constitutes a valuable step towards a better understanding of the problem of machine translation  .
