Chinese machine translatlon can be achieved by organizing all the necessary llng ~ istic data in such a way that the computer can compare and retrieve them in the most economical way  . We are constantly reminded that the storage space in the co~uter is limited  , and the processing time is expensive . We mmstaim at the efficiency of the system without sacrificing accuracy  . 
Five types of linguistic data have to be s to red in the computer before a translation can be rendered :  ( 1 ) a Chinese to English dictionary , (2) Chinese syntactic rules ,   ( 3 ) syntactic converslon rules from Chinesest ructure to English structure  , (4) English morphological rules , and (5) the text to be translated . 
(1 ) The dictionary must have the capability to distinguish automatically the diffe rent meanings which a Chinese lexeme represents  . 
l ~ an mn readers can do this and 8o can the machine if enough linguistic info rmation is stored in the computer  . To a certain extent the meanings of a given lexema can be differentiated by its dif ferent syntactic functions  . For example the word i means ' one ' when it 18 used as a numeral . A numeral i8 defined as the class of words which is fol lowed by a classifier  , a measure , a collective and a partitive noun and o ther numerals  . I means ' once ' when it i8 used as an adverb which is always followed by a verb  . Anything else which is not covered by these two rules will have to be listed in the d ictionary either as an idiom or as a laxe me with its immediate constituent  . Sometimes a , , ore re f ined syntact i c codes are needed to d i s t ingu ish the d i f fe rent meanings of a g iven verb  , as in the case of tzuoh ~ . When it is followed by an inanimate noun , it is translated to ' make ' , by an abstract noun , it i8 translated to ' do ' , and by a human noun , it is translated to ' be ' . Any other constitutes which are exceptions to the rules will have to be listed in the dictionary  , such as tzuo hran ' behave ' , tzuohfann'cook ' , and tzuohs how'celebrate a birthday ' . 
For the convenience of programming , each dictionary entry . 
which may be a lexeme , an idiom or a constitute , has only one syn-tactic code and its respect ive meaning  . After a sentence has been an al ~ . eed by the automatic parser , the syntactic function of each lexeme i8 determined . Together with the method of longest match in d ictionary lookup  , the correct meaning of a given lexeme in ag iven context can be chosen by the machine  . 
(2 ) The Chinese syntactic rules are formulated in such a way that they may reduce the ambiguit ies in parsing to a minimum  . It is assumed that in a good scientific wr iting  , tl ~ e sentences are not ambiguous and there is on ly one correct way of parsing which can carry the process to the end of the sentence  . Anybody who has had any experience with the automatic parser will know this goalist i es  , and probably there are others . 
One of the methods is to add more refinements to the syntactic codes  . Semantic elements mere introduced in the fo raulatlon of the syntactic codes  , so that the constitutes must be meaningful as well grammatical  . For example : by adding the human element to the codes  , only the human nouns can be the agents of the human verbs  . If an inanimate noun occurs before a human verb  , it is likely to be the goal rather than the agent of the verb  . For further refinement , the element of plurality is also added to the codes  , so that only the plural nouns can be the agents of plural verbs  . There is a class of adverbs , such as it or ng * together ' , huhshiang * mutually ' end biits yy ' to each other * usually pluralize any verb that follows them  . 
The second method of reducing ambiguities is to introduce higher levels to the noun and verb phrases  . There are ~ ive levels of noun phrases for example  . The terminal code is called level 1 . When the noun is modified by an adjective , a noun or an adjective phrase , the noun phrase is called level 2 . Level 1 or 2 modified by a number and a classifier is called level  3  . Modified by e determiner , it is called level 4 . When the latter is modified by a pronoun , a relative clause or an apposition , it is called level 5 . The noun phrase of level 5 is a closed noun phrase ; nothing else can be added to it . 
The constitute IRD ( indicative expression ) is formed by a closed noun phrase and a closed verb phrase  . Even if the noun phrase consists of only the terminal code  , this rule also applies linearly .

The third way of reducing the ambiguities i s to adopt the principle of the longest match in the dictionary lookup  . Just take the four characters yenyanshyue jia ' linguist ' as an exsmple  ; all four of them can be used freely or ind ividually  . The first three characters are both nouns and verbs  . AS nouns the first two mean both ' language ' and ' word '  , and the third means ' learning ' . As verbs , the first two mean'speak ' and third , ' learn ' . The fourth one means '- is t ' , ' family ' and ' home ' . The compound of the first two means ' language ' and that of the last two means '- i s t '  . The compound of the first three characters means ' linguistics '  . Sixtyunwanted constitutes can result f rom these four characters alone  . With the longest match with the dictionary entry  , the four characters act as a single unit , and thus sixty ambiguities can beel iminated  . 
(3 ) The syntactic conversion rules from Chinese to English are formulated on the basis of comparative study of the structures of both Chinese and English sentences which represent the same mean-lug  . It is assumed that if the structure of the English sentence or phrase is the same as that of the Chinese sentence or phrase  , no syntactical conversion is necessary . Simple lexical substitution and the application o ? the English morphological rules will render the correct translation  . Diagram I shows that the structure of the

English is the same as that of the Chinese . By placing the English equivalents in the location of the grammar codes  ( The grammar codes are used in parsing .  )  , the translation is already rendered in the citation forms  . The last thing that needs to be done is to app ly the English morphological rules to the citation forms  , so that ' that ' is changed to ' those ' and ' linguist'to'linguists ' and ' write ''~ d' to ' wrote ' The structures of many Engl?sh phrases are not the same as those of the Chinese phrases  . In cases like these , some syntactic conver-sions , in the forms of permutation , addition or deletion are needed . 
The fo~low in ~ examples will illustrate the logic on the basis of which the syntactic conversion rules are formulated  . 
The verb phrase which consists of a prepositional phrase and a main verb calls for a simple permutation in the conversion  . The code for such a verb phrase is VI*R ( or VI HtR if the human element is added ) where * indicates that a conversion is needed aud R indicates that the conversion is in the form of permutation of the two constituents  .

The arrow ( used in the sense of programming language ) indicates where the conversion occurs . The two items on the left side of the arroe are replaced by the two items on the rights ide  . The consti-tuents of these two eonstftu tesw?11 follo ~ accordingly . This conversion can be easily manipulated by the machine  . 
Even though the Chinese pretrans it lvep repos ition  , ba __ ~ e or jlan_ . _ . ~ g , is the same as other prepositions struc turally  , it is deleted in the English structure . Therefore an additional conversion rule NB*L is needed  . The Lafter the * indicates that the left constituent is to be deleted  .

The conversion rule for the passive construction on the other hand requires addition  . For example:

WP2VTH*B<VTH*B~372~--~$~"~~'~, . -~ bebreak ~ en by one child All the syntact i c conversion rules are either unary or b inary  ( some longer ones are forced to be binary ) in order to save table space in the computer . The table of constitutes resulted from the automatic parser consists of three columns : the array of the constitutes  , the array of the left constituents and the array of the right constituents  . A search through the array of the constitutes , the computer will know where and what conversion rules are  , to be applied . For example:
Before Conversion After Conversion
Column I Column 2 Column 3 Column 2 Column 3
VI leRWD2 Vll2 VIH2 WD2
VIR*RW 3* LVTH VTH WB*L
WB*LW8 NN~NN
VI*PWP2 VTR*B VTH*Bl~P2
VTH*B VTH1 VVBE VTH-EN
Another advantage of such a system is that fur ther differentiation of meanings is made possible  . It has been mentioned earlier that the mean ings of a given lexeme can be differentia ted by its context  . When the context is as long as a clause or a phrase  , it is best handled by syntactic conversion rules  . For example : the character ~'~ de is transla ted to '' s'  , " of ' , ' who ( which , when or where )' , ' the one who ( which , when or where ) ' and ' ~' under different conditions , a problem cannot be solved by dictionary lookup  , but can be solved by the different consti tutes it forms with other constituents  . 
The constitute NDE , whose left constituent is a noun or verb phrase of any level or a whole clause and whose right constituent is de  , can be an adjective or a noun . It is an adjective when it i8 followed by a noun phrase and it is a noun when it is preceded or followed by a verb phrase  . First of all its function should be determined by the automatic parser ~ the noun  ( NNDE ) is distinguished from the adjective ( NDE )  . The internal structures of both are the same in Chinese  , but they represent different meanings which are re-presented by different English lexemes  . Emphasis should be made here that this is not an adhoc attempt to write a Chinese grammar on the basis of English translat ion  , but an attempt to incorporate semantic
I 0 information into the system as demanded by the machine  . Very frequently the different English translations point out the fact that a given Chinese lexeme represents different meanings in different contexts  . A closer analysis of the contexts will reveal that the conditions which produce the same translation are usually consistently similar  . 
The two subclasses of NDE and NNDE are not sufficient to differentiate the various meanings de represents  . Further refinements have to be made within each subclass of NDE or NNDE  . The following pairs ( NDE and NNDE ) of conversion rules will illustrate this point . 
( a ) Possession The meaning of possession is represented by de in Chinese and ' s in English when they are preceded by animate nouns  , especially human nouns , and pronouns . Both the adjective and the nominal forms can be converted the same way  .

Otherwise it can only be converted to ONEOF.

VC ~ DE VC V~O NE he , imple one ( f ) A translated syntactic connective The deconnects a verb phrase to a noun represents no meaning  , but it has an English equivalent in the form of a relative pronoun  . The case of the pronoun depends on the constituent that precedes the de  . 
If the verb phrase consists of an intransitive verb phrase  , the noun that the NDE modifies , or the NNDE implies is the subject of the verb phrase  . For example:
NH*RNH*R
VI2N~ER<R~~~/~ER*R\VI2/\./\

VIZVIZ

VC VT HNN DEV CONE WHO ~ NN ~ ~- ~ ~- ~ he theo ~ e who ~ o  , boo~WHO and ONEWHO are used as codes for subjective relative pronouns  . They may be where , which or when depending on their antecedents . In order to make the computer to choose between where  , who , which and when , more refinements have to be introduced to the codes of higher nodes  . 
If the verb phrase before the deconsists of a subject  ( or agent ) and a transitive verb , the noun that the NDE modifies and the NNDE implies is the object of the verb phrase  . For example:
Nl'I*RNI~R //\
NR v r D E NH NH WHO MNR V T : ~ ~ . ~~/ ~ man . horn ~ see
VIZVIZ/NNDER*ROI~NDER*ROsvr\'./\\/\
VCNR WEDEV CONEI ~ OMNR WE~~L~be the one whom ~ see When the constitute is formed by a complete clause and de  , it can only be an adjective which usually modifies the nouns such as time  , place , method , instrument , manner and condition . Its conversion rule is the same as that for the intransitive verb phrase  . 
Of the millions of dephrases , ten conversion rules are suffl-cient to d ifferentiate the many meanings that d_~e represents  , and render a rough but adequate translation . In fact not many conversion rul Qe are needed . In addition to those mentioned above , there are those for comparative construct ions  , locative phrase and some minor ones . 
(~ ) English morphological rules have been worked out by others  . 
How they will be applied to machine transla tion from Chinese to Eng-lish is a problem yet to be solved  . Some of the solutions can be written into the dictionary  , and some , incorporated into the syntactic conversion ru les  . A great deal of research have been done in this area  ; the main problem is to implement he informat i onto the existing system  . 
(5 ) The Chinese text to be translated is encoded in the Chinese telegraphic codes  . The problem of allographs ( including abbreviations ) are taken care of by the dictionary lookup . The allographs represent the same lexeme are re ferred to that lexeme by the system  . Punctuations prove to be confusing . The period is used to terminate a sentence , any other usage of the period , such as marking the end of a sub-title , should be eliminated . Otherwise every sentence can be nominalized by the automatic parser  . 
With some knowledge of PL/I , I amtempted to say that machine translation from Chinese to English is not only possib le  , it is also easy to program . A program can be written to read the dict ionary  , the syntactic rules and the text , parse the sentences and store the constitu tes  . The program searches through the array of const it utes for the symbol of *  , and then performs the syntactic conversions as indicated by the codes that follow the *  . Once this is done , ther program retrieves the constituents of each constitute until the constituents are the terminal laxemes ? Then the translation is already rendered in the citation forms  . 
It is unfortunate that machine translation was considered Correct machine translation of modern scientific writing is possib le if enough organized linguistic data are stored in the computer  . 
In the past twelve years the rigid demands imposed by the computer have accelerated the progress of linguistic research on many nat ive languages  . It is due to the demand of the automatic parser  , the systematized syntactic rules were fo rmulated  . It is due the demand of choosing automatical ly the correct translation by the computer  , the Study of semantics was initiated . Now the meanings of a given lexeme can be dif ferentiated in terms of its context  . With more sophisticated linguistic data of both source and target languages  , more efficient prograu ~ ing language , and bigger and faster computers , machine translation can be a reality in the near future  .
