Traditionally , paradigms were used to deal with inflection in inflectionally rich hlnguages  . Only recently ( Calder , 1989; Carstairs-McCarthy , I988 ,  1992 ) paradigms have been the object or a far-reaching investigatic m covering their formal and conlputational properties  . This investigation has hig blig the d the sign if icance of a paradigm-based treatment of morphonological phenon lena and its theoretical implications  . In this paper , we show how derivational processes in Morphology can be treated paradigmatically by using a mtn'llhonological network  . The approach is not only theoretical speculation but has been subjected to the practical test of a computer implementation  . This implementation leads , in our opinion , to a conceptually and conqJutationally eleane , treatment of Morphonology .

There are two basic ways to relate a pair of nlorpllouological representations deriwitlon Mly :   1  ) to take either o1'them as bslsic , a ridderive tile other rronlit via all rocess of rule-governed phonological change  ( Fig . Ibelow ) ;  2 ) to as stune a third representation ( somewhat intermediate between the two ) as underlying , and make tile other two derive I'rt ) lnit either by substitution of some phonological segments  , or by filling in an underspecified phonological representation  ( Fig . 2 below ) .

Usually , so hition 1 stores the basic form only in the lexicon , while tile derivative is , s is it were , cranked out on demand by rule application I . On the other hand , so ht tion 2 requires that only one underlying , abstract representation be stored in the lexicon : the two related tbrms are yielded from their common lexical source by rules  . If b and c sire then lor phonological representations to relate  , the two approaches can be illustrated as shown in Figg  . 1 arid 2 . 
hi Fig . I , barid care taken tn be on a different footing : the formal the top is more basic than tile one tit the bottom  , the arrow indicating a derivational relation . The IMIowing assumption is made : given two forms to relate  , it is always possible to specify the direction of the arrow  .

Let us consider a small but crucial portion of English segmental Phonology as classically analysed since Clmmsky  , ' lndllalle (1968) . First , schwa is wellknown to alternate with full vowels within the Pllonology of English  . l ) erivational series such s is in I : ig . 3 below show tllat full vowels under stress corresp  ( md to sch was in unstressed llOSilions .

This alternation is captured by a rule of vowel reduction : full vowels are reduced to schwain unstressed position  ( e . g . , I ', el -> schwain photography) . Another systematic l ~ honologic alternation in English involves derivational pairs such as sane -xmfity  ( l'sejnl/l's , ' eniti\]) , which strongly suggest a derivational rule like ej->m  . 
I lowever , other alternations appear to go in I he opposite direction  . For example in a triple like morginsl 1Alternatively   , both representations can be stored in he Lexicon  , and related throughtiles latem cnt of some rcchm dancy Icxical rule  ( lst ckend off ,  1975) . 
234 hnar ? in a lily/margin Glia , the following alternation in the underlined vowel emerges : schwa/~e/ej  . If we posit/~e/as underlying , then we end up having to set up an lie /->/ ej /change  , which is tile mirro , +- image of the/ej/->ke/relation posited for tim derivation all  ) air\['sejn\]/l'smniti\] ( more on this illl ) ur and ,  1990) . 
The sohttion illustrated in Fig . 2 above is a way to solve this apparent paradox . A third abstract segment / , ' e :/ is assulned to be basic rehltive to/schwa /``e/ejt  . 
This means that/schwa/m/ej/can be derived from/m:/through application of some phonohigieal rules  . A derivational chain of this sort can be ralher conlp lex  , since I ' , e :/ and lej/are , phonokigically , far removed from each other , and ninny intermediate changes can he needed ( asillI'me:nl->I'se:nl->I'se:inl->I ' sejnl  ; suetlalle and Mohanan , (1985) for more examples ) . More reservations on chains of lifts sort have been expressed recently in a series of psycholinguistic experintents  , aimed ill probing the reality of tile derivational asstunptions  ( Jaeger , 1986; Wang and Derwing ,  1986) . 
ht the literature , an allogether different ai ) proach froi I1 both derivational accounls I ) and 2 ) al ) ove has been suggested ( Vennemann ,  1974 ) : bande should simply be lisled in the Lexicon , one beside the other , On : lpar : pro'fawnd- . .91 I -, . -pro'f^nditiFig . 4 mo , phonological relations and lexical listing Formulated in this wily  , tile relation in l:igA is always " true on the surface "  , shlce there is no abstract representation i volved ill this account  . Moreover , no rule ordering ploblems arise ( i . e . , concerning tilt direction of the arrow ) . If the so hltion in Fig . 4 is adopted , however , it is not at all clear what type of lexical architecture one is suggesting : i  . e . , it is moot whether b and c are sontehow related in I he lexicon  , or they are simply listed together . More worringly , tiltnotion " true on tile surface " is of little theoretical help for explaining sotnewell known eases of alternalion  . 
Take , for example , the opposition between tile American English pronunciation of writer and rider  , respectively h'ajVerland/ra:jV'er/ , where hoth/t/and/d/have been turned into a flap  ( \[ l'\] )  . If lheonly difference between the two phonological realizations is the surface-true lengthening of ~ illin/ra:jVel '/  , then one is nlissing the relation between vowel length and tile verbal b  , ' tses of the two derivatives , a relation liutt represents an important , productive generalization within the American English phonological system  ( l ) ur and ,  1990) . 
An American English speaker , when asked to derive a new agentive in-er from verbs ending in / t /  , will produce flapping with no lengthening . In contrast ,   ( s ) he will produce both a lengthened vowel and a flap if tilebase is a verb ending in / d /  . Derivational acct : , tmts capture this generalization in an elegant way  , through rule ordering : vowel lengthening takes place before flapping does  , in the context " vowel followed by a voiced consonant "  , so that when either/t/or/d/disappears , lengthening has idready applied ( OF failed to ) . 
ht contrast , accounts based on lexical lisling al+eclea Hy incapable of grasping this significant hidden relation  , since the opposition between/I/and/d/is no longer true on the surface in pairs such as / rail'er/vs/ra:il'er/  , where the opposition is neutralized by a flal x To sum up  , derivational accotlnts of nmr phonological a lternations\['  , ' I ceant unber of theoretical and practical pl ' olf lenm  .

In this section tile idea is illustrated that redundancies among linguistic data can he used to convey interesting linguistic generalizations if  (  . lainlll'es lore dill an incremental network , l . etus consider the general case first , exemplified by the following list of abstract cases and their categorial classification :  137 x 037 x 33"/ xSUl ) lmSe that tile sequence of n unterals 137 represent stile I or m of a linguistic ot:iect ( say a word )  ; x is its category . We can represent these dalaby exploiting tile redundancies that they show at both tile lbrnml and categorial level of description as follows :

The idea is to inler connect all forms chtssified the same w'ty by lelting I hent share acmnmon I ' or nmlcore if there is any  ( for a rigorous definition of tile notion of for nmlcore  , see Pirrelli ,  1993) . In Fig . 5,-37 is I helinmal core . A core with its category ( x in the example at h:md ) is called a nucleus . The graph it/Fig . 5 can be seen as a nelwork of nodes .

Given a network like this , network cores are activated hyan input string if they are contained by it  . The nelwork output will then be the calcgory associated with the actiwl tcd core  .

Fig .   6 riw flcores in a multicategory network More concretely  , if a certain lbrm , say 437 , ix given as input to the network , the system tries to guess the right category on the basis of the analogy of  437   ( called the target string ) with already stored items ( called base strings )   . This is carried out through the l bllowing steps . Network cores are actival cd by 437: this is done through a simple string-matching routine  2  . 
For example , 37 will be actiwtted , and its category xix a candidate response of the system for the input  437  . What happens when more than one core gets activated by the same input token ? If the activated cores have the same category  , the corresponding mtd tiple responses would reinforce each other : the only category activated is given as OUtl ~ Ut  . The case of multiple responses with different categories  ( and thus potentially different outputs ) is more complex . We can dislinguish two cases : I ) there is no core which is fully activated 2 ) there ix at least one fully activated core . 
A core is fully activated when it is entirely contained by the input string : in the example above  437 fully actiwttes the core -37  . This contrasts with partial activation , when the core is only partially contained by the input string : for example  , 437 part Mly activates the core-38 of Fig . 6 above , since it contains 3 in the second position , but not 8 in the third . Let ns consider case 1) above first , l\['there is no core which is fully activated , then the system goes through the following two steps : la  ) for each candidate response , the system gauges an Activation Ratio : number of numerals  ( + 1 the activated core contained in input total number of numerals in the act Nated core The actiwttion ratio  ( AcR ) is then 0 < AcR_<I . The case of full actiwt tion ( A cR = 1 ) is dealt within 2 )  ; lb ) the core with the highest AcR wins out over the others  . 
Let us consider now case 2) . If there exists at least one fully activated core  , then two I ' urfl ~ er subcases need be distinguished  :   2a   ) there is only one core which is fully activated : the category borne out by that core is  2 Moreon string-matching will be said in section 4 of this papcr . 
then picked up ; 2b ) there are at least two cores which are fully activated  . 2a ) can be seen as a degenerate case of 1 ) above , when AcR = I . As to 2b ) , in this case the activation ratio is clearly no longer conclusive  . One needs to gauge : t further ratio , called Analogy Ratio , whose definition follows : total number of numerals in the activated core total number of numerals in input & gain  , the analogy ratio ( AnR ) is 0< An R_<13 . 
To stnnup , a certain pattern is analogic , ' dly activated if the following conditions are met int iffs order : 
I ) it is activated by an input pair 2 ) it has got the highest activation ratio 3 ) it has got the highest analogy ratio So far , we have been assenting that the network produces cores incrementally as more data  . ' n'o input . In fact , then cl work pfogressively exlracts ret lncedcores  . 
Each full form is a heady a core in its own right , otherwise it would never get activated . The exmt ction of smaller cores represents the process of acquiring generalizations on the basis of the analogy between data  ( redundancies )  . In the network , an exception is simply an isolated case , that is a nucleus which is fully actiwtted only when it is witnessed in input in its enlirct y  ( AnR = I )  .

I low is it possible to model the synthesis of the set of systematic alternations illustrated in section I by means of a network such as the one in Fig  . 6 ?

Let us suppose that the system has to produce the agentive nominalization  ( lighter ) of \[' lajtl , whose surface form and lexica I content basbeen already stored in the network  ( Fig . 9-i above ) . A flap ( will \] no lengthening ) would then automatically appearill the place of surface\[-t\]  , according to tile following steps : a ) the input conditions are represented by the lexical content  o1' the verb light ( w in Fig . 9-i ) , and the categorial information " agentive nominalization "  ( o in Fig . 9) ; b ) wactiw ~ test he \[1\] of \[ lajt lill the paradign li ) of Fig . 9 above ; e ) tim activated coreo triggers the flap alternation\[-ajF'er\]of word-final\[-ajt \] in Fig  . 9 - i , and the alte , ' nation\[a:jF'er\]of word final\[-a:jd\]in Fig  . 9- ii ; d ) the form\[' lajFer \] is thus produced , since there is a palh of pradigmatic links between \[ ll  .

It should be noted that only ( semi ) regular alternation share some ( sub ) core ( s ) in common . 
Suppletions such as go/went simply do not.
Nevertheless , no clearcut distinction is drawn here between minor alternations and irregular forms  , since all of themm'es imply stored in an analogy -based network  . 
Their difference is accounted for in terms of a gradation  , defined by the fact that regular a hernations overlap with other lorms more extensively titan do snppletions  . We believe that this solution is empirically superior to tile An aximander's principle invoked by\[ludson  ( 1974 )  , to the effect that , since there exists no clearcut distinction between suppletions and systematic alternations  , all of them should be listed in the lexicon .

FURTIIERIMPROVEMENTS.
The network has been implemented in C , and proved to be 95% accurate in analysis after a training on 20  , 000 Italian word forms , and 75% accurate ill synthesi , as reported in Pirrelli and Federici (1991) . 
These performances have been obtained hy using tile simplified model illusm~ted here  . 
It should he noted , however , that this model works well for the Morphology of I hose hm guages  ( such as Italian and English ) where affixation is commonly realized through a concatenative operation  ( surfixation or prel'ixation )  . In these cases , string-matching is a fairly simple head-and-tail operation  . Clearly , this model is far from having a universal , crosslinguistic wdidity though . For example , it does not work well with cases of circumfixation  ( known also as parasynthesis )  , let alone tile Morphology of nonconcatenative l 'mguages  . 
Nevertheless , we contend that the set of analogy-based principles illustrated here hold Ibra wider spectrum or hmguages than purely concatenative ones : by making string-nmtehing a more flexible and powerful operation  , we can successfully adapt our model to the require naents of noncatenative language such as Arabic  , or Io the treatment of discontinuous affixation . What rollows sketchily illustrates this line of develo I-m/ent  . 
(liven two strings of characters/phonemes to match  ( called t be base and tile target string )  , the new string-matching algorithm ( discontinuous string-matching ) we are currently expe , ' in a enting on is , informally : smrtfi ' om the h'ft corner of both the target and base string and scan them rightwards  ; extract , down the way , all character d phonemes which appear in both , and in the same order .

5 CONCIAJSIONS .
The architecture illustrated here can be looked at as a model of the morphonok~gical competence of a native speaker  , and functions both in analysis and generation . 
At this point , a question aturally arises : is it a lexicon or a gran/nlar ? In our opinion  , it is both : a self-modelling lexicon which extracts generalizations on tile basis of tile an ak  ) gies between : lheady slored items , and uses these generalizations are pair strategies for hick of direct evidence provided hyanaheady stored item  . This interpenetration of lexicon aild graillnl , : lrofl ' , a isa\['cwadvantagesi , idealing wilh tile problenllith and :- phono logical concreteness of lexieal represent at ions : known lexieal items are given a full surface phonological representation i the lexical network : no abstract phonological segments such as \[ m : \[ in the phonological representation f prqf in  . l d i . Fig . 2 are needed ;- alternations vs deletions a , ld inversions : changes ill thel ) honologic : llstructure of at given entry are always expressed : is alterlultions  , never as delelions ; I his has the obvious implicalion that all alternating segments are encoded in the network and can be retrieved at any time : e  . g . , one does not say that flapping makes a dental disappear  , bUl that I la Plfing can appear only in those paradigmatic on texts where a dental is also present  ; this limits the computational power of the required rule set considerably  , since deletive rules are eoln putationally most costly  ; moreover , by Ireating eases of metathesis paradigmatically , the system further sparestim computational price of ' atlanslornmtiona\[operation such as inversion  . 
-unordered rules : the context Ik ~ ra given phonological change to take place can be specified in terms of It whole paradigm  ; this formulation has lirair runediate advantage of awfiding the need for rule-ordering : Ibr example  , the fact that writer in the American-lblglish prontmciation hast at  ) lenglhened lajlis traditionally accounted for by ordering vowel lengthenirig before flapping  ; this move is no longer needed as long as one can restrict the applicatiou of vowel lengthening to tile paradign l of those nuclei which present \[ a : jlill the base Ibm  ) of a verb , as we showed above ; -phonological concreteness of extracled l teneralizations : phonological generalizations are expressedira terms of extracted nuclei  ; nucleire present what is shared by two ( or more ) sit ) red items ; it I bllows I hatnophonological features appenr in extracted nuclei other I hant hose which occt n ' in the surface representations from which nuclei are derived  ; - use cfl ' direct evidence : as we saw , snlaller nuclei ( morphemes ) c ( )ia/e into play as repair strategies only ; I hat is , if and only if there exists no whole lcxical reprcsenlatic m  ( an already known word ) which matches ( rather Iheinl > Ut ( in analysis ) or the output ( in generation ) in its entirety ; otherwise , bigger nuclei always override smaller () ties ; this accounts for phenomena of Icxical blocking ( Aronoff ,  1976) , when-say-the word business is never interpreled ns the ' quality of being busy '  .
