The reality of analogies between words is re-futed by no one  ( e . g . , I walked is to to walk as I laughed is to to laugh  , notedI walked:to walk::I laughed:to laugh )  . But computational linguists seem to be quite dubious about analogies between sentences : they would not be enough numerous to be of any use  . We report experiments conducted on a multilingual corpus to estimate the number of analogies among the sentences that it contains  . We give two estimates , a lower one and a higher one . As an analogy must be valid on the level of form as well as on the level of meaning  , we relied on the idea that translation should preserve meaning to test for similar meanings  . 
1 Introduction
A long tradition in linguistics views analogy as a means for the speaker to analyze or produce new  sentences1  . To be linguistically relevant , an analogy should hold on the level of form as well as on the level of meaning  . 
In contrast to that , in Greek and Latinantiquity , anomaly designated those cases2 where an analogy of meaning is not reflected by an analogy of form  . 
(e . g . , ? I drink . ?: ? I?d like to drink . ?: : ? I canswim . ?: ? I?d like to be able to swim . ?3) . 
Conversely , the existence of analogies of form that are not verified on the level of meaning has been taken by the Generativists to indicate the independence of syntax  ( e . g . , Abby is baking vegan pies . : Abbyisbaking . : : Abby is too tasteful to pour gravy 1See , inter alia , ( PAUL ,  1920 , chap . 5), ( deSAUSSURE , 1995, 3rd part , chap . iv ), ( BLOOMFIELD , 1933, p . 276), ( MOUNIN , 1968, p . 119?120), ( ITKONEN , 1994, p . 48?50), ( PULLUM , 1999, p . 340?343) . 
2 In those times , the cases considered were in fact in morphology ( See ,   . e . g . , VARRO , Delingual at in e) . 
3 The meaning ? I?d like to be able to swim . ? cannot be construed as ? I?d like to canswim . 
onveganpies . : Abby is too tasteful to pour gravy on . 4) . 
The purpose of this study is to estimate the number of ? true analogies ? present in a large corpus  , i . e . , analogies which hold both on the level of form , as well as on the level of meaning . 
Formally , let us denote ? A ? as some meaning , and L ( ? A ? ) as the set of all possible ways of realising ? A ? in a particular language L  . Let us denote A as some realisation of ? A ?, i . e . , A?L(?A ?) . With these notations , we want to count , in a given corpus , all cases where the following holds5 . 
A?L(?A ?) ?
B?L(?B ?) ?
C?L(?C ?) ?
D ? L(?D ?) ?
A : B : : C : D ? ? A ? : ? B ? : : ? C ? : ? D ?
The reason for estimating the number of ? true analogies ? in a large corpus comes from the fact that it has been felt that ? true analogies ? between sentences are rare  . There is a general feeling that analogy is well attested between words  , i . e . , on the level of morphology , but not so much between sentences 6 . We will show that , at least in the corpus we used , this feeling has to be reconsidered . 
4In the third sentence , gravy is poured onveganpies , while it is poured on Abby ( ! ) in the fourth sentence . This is not parallel to the first and second sentences where Abby plays the same role  . This would imply that there is something about to pour which does not come directly from its form nor from its meaning  . 
5Needless to say , we disregard trivial cases of the form
A:A::A:A and A:A::C:C.
6It is not our purpose to address this issue , but the claim that some necessary analogies cannot be built from linguistic data available to children constitutes in fact the basis of the ? arguments from the poverty of the stimulus  . ? See ( PULLUM and SCHOLTZ , 2002) and ( LEGATE and YANG ,  2002) . 
2 The corpus used
For this study , we used the Basic Traveler?s Expression Corpus , or BTEC , for short 7 . This is a multilingual corpus of expressions from the travel and tourism domain  . It contains 162 , 318 aligned translations in several languages . Here , we shall use Chinese , English and Japanese . There are 96 , 234 different sentences in Chinese ,  97 , 769 in English and 103 , 274 in Japanese 8 . The sentences in BTEC are quite short as the figures in Table  1 show . 
3 Analogies on the level of form 3 . 1 Method On the level of form , a possible formalisation of analogy between strings of symbols has been proposed  ( LEPAGE , 2001) which renders an account of some analogies 9 . 
A : B : : C : D ? ? ? ? ? a , Aa + Da = Ba + Cadist(A , B ) = dist(C , D ) dist(A , C ) = dist(B , D ) Here , a is a character , whatever the writing system , and A , B , C and D are strings of characters . A a stands for the number of occurrences of a?s in A  . 
dist(A , B ) is the edit distance between strings A and B , i . e . , the minimal number of insertions and deletions10 of characters necessary to transform A into B . 
Obviously , applied to sentences considered as strings of characters  ( not strings of words )  , this formalisation can only render an account of analogies on the level of form  . Figure 1 shows examples of analogies meeting the above definition  . 
3.2 Results
It takes some ten days to gather all possible analogies of form using the above definition on a Pentium  4 computer at 2  . 8 Hz with 2Gb memory for a corpus of around 100 , 000 sentences . Of course , we 7http://www . c-star . org/ . 
8The difference in size between Japanese and the other languages may be explained by the indifferent use of kanji or hiragana : e  . g . , ???? or ???/ kudasai/(please ) . 
9Some cases of analogies are not considered by this definition  , like reduplication : e . g . , I play tennis . : I play tennis . Do you play tennis too ?:: I play guitar . : I playguitar . Do you play guitar too ? , or mirroring : stressed : desserts :: reward : drawer  . Also , in reality , this formalisation is only an implication . But we shall use it as if it were an equivalence . 
1 0Substitutions and transpositions are not considered as basic edit operations  . 
do not inspect all possible quadruples of sentences  . 
Rather , a hierarchical coding of sentences based on counts of characters allows us to infer the absence of any analogy within large sets of sentences  . This cuts the computational load . To compute edit distances , a fast bitstring similarity computation algorithm  ( ALLISON and DIX , 1986) is used . 
We counted the number of analogies of form in each of the monolingual Chinese  , English and Japanese parts of the corpus using the previous formula  . The examples of Figure 1 are actual examples of analogies retrieved . Table 2 shows the counts for each language . The numbers obtained are quite large . For English , we report around 2 . 5 million analogies of form involving more than 50 , 000 sentences . That is to say , half of the sentences of the corpus are already in immediate analogy with other sentences of the same corpus  . 
3.3 Discussion
The average number of analogies of form per sentence in each different language over all unique sentences may be estimated in the following way:  1  ,  639 ,  068 / 96 ,  234 = 17 . 03 for Chinese , 2,384, 202/97, 769=24 . 39 for English and 1,910,065/103,274 = 18 . 50 for Japanese . Averaging the sentences involved , this becomes : 5 ,  059 ,  979 / 49 ,  675 = 33 , 00 for Chinese ,  2 ,  384 ,  202 / 53 ,  250 = 44 . 77 for English and 1,910,065/53,572 = 35 . 65 for Japanese , which indicates that , on average , there are dozens of different ways to obtain these sentences by analogy with other sentences  . 
These counts are necessarily higher bounds of the numbers of ? true analogies ?  , as they rely on form only . For instance , the first analogy in Figure 1 is not a ? true analogy ? . However , it is quite difficult to spot such analogies , so that the overall impression is that analogies of form which are not analogies of meaning are exceptions  . So , our next problem will be to try to retain only those analogies which are also analogies of meaning  . 
4 A lower estimate : meaning preservation through translation  4  . 1 Method Computing analogies between structural representations is  possible11  . Unfortunately , the corpus we have at our disposal does not offer any structural representation  . And it does not seem that tools are yet available which would deliver semantic  ( not syntactic ) representations for all sentences of our corpus in all three languages we deal with  . 
Fortunately , common sense has it that translation preserves meaning12  , and , by definition , a multilingual corpus , like the one we use , contains corresponding utterances in different languages  . Consequently , we shall assume that if two sentences A1 and A2 in two different languages are translations of one another  ( noted A1 ? A2 )  , then , they should be the linguistic realisations of the same meaning  , and reciprocally 13 . 
? ? A?/A1 ? L1(?A ?)
A2?L2(?A ?) ? A1 ? A2(i)
Suppose that at least one analogy of form can be found to hold in every possible language of the world for some possible realisations of four given meanings  . Then , for sure , the analogy of meaning can be said to hold . 
? L , ? A?L(?A ?) , ? B?L(?B ?) , ? C?L(?C ?) , ? D?L(?D ?) , A : B : : C : D ? ? A ? : ? B ? : : ? C ? : ? D ? If we suppose that the number of languages is finite  , let us denote it n , counting the number of ? true analogies ? in a set of sentences in a given language  , say L1 , is tantamount to counting the cases described by the following formula  ( ii )  . 
11 ( ITKONEN and HAUKIOJA ,  1997 ) show how ? true analogies ? can be computed by relying at the same time on the surface and the structural representation of sentences  . 
12See ( CARL ,  1998 ) for an attempt at classifying machine translation systems relying on this idea  . 
13Note that , in this formula , L1 and L2 need not be different . 
If the language is the same , then , A1 and A2 are paraphrases . 
A1?L1(?A ?) ?... ? An?Ln(?A ?) ?
B1?L1(?B ?)?... ? Bn?Ln(?B ?)?
C1?L1(?C ?)?...? Cn?Ln(?C ?)?
D1?L1(?D ?) ? .   .   . ? Dn ? Ln(?D ?) ? ? i ? 1, .   .   .   , n , Ai : Bi :: Ci : Di ? ? A ? : ? B ? : : ? C ? : ? D ? Of course  , the problem is : how to test again all possible languages ? Obviously  , relying on more languages should give a higher accuracy to the method  . Here , we have only three languages at our disposal . By relying on languages which are typologically different like Chinese  , English and Japanese , it is reasonable to think that we somewhat counterbalance the small number of languages used  . 
To summarize , by using Equivalence ( i ) , and by considering only sentences attested in our corpus  , Formula ( ii ) can be restated as follows , when restricted to three languages . 
A1:B1::C1:D1 llll
A2: B2::C2: D2llll
A 3  :  B3  ::  C3  :  D3 ? ? A ? : ? B ? : : ? C ? : ? D ? Practically , thus , the number of ? true analogies ? is just the cardinal of the intersection set of the sets of analogies for each possible language  . 
4.2 Results 4.2.1 Pairwise intersection
Out of a total of 2 , 384 , 202 English analogies on the level of form ,  238 , 135 are common with Chinese . 
They involve 25,554 sentences . Consequently ,   10% of the English analogies of form may be thought to be analogies of form and meaning  , i . e . , ? true analogies ?, when relying only on Chinese . 
Between English and Japanese the number of analogies in common is  336  , 287 ( involving 24 , 674 sentences ) which represents 14% of the English analogies . An example is given in Figure 2 . 
Between Chinese and Japanese very similar figures are obtained  , as the number of analogies in common between these two languages is  329  , 429 ( involving 25 , 127 sentences ) . 
4.2.2 Chinese?English ? Japanese
Taking the intersection of Chinese , English and Japanese leads to a figure of 68 , 164 ? true analogies ? , involving 13 , 602 different sentences . 
4.3 Discussion
Although the number of analogies dropped from 2 . 5 million analogies of form in English , down to less than 70 , 000 when intersecting with Chinese and Japanese , one cannot say that the obtained figure is small . 
The average number of ? true analogies ? per sentence over all the corpus is:  162  ,  318 / 68 ,  184 = 0 . 42 . In other words , in this corpus , one sentence is involved in about half a ? true analogy ? in average  , taking it for granted that the linguistic differences between Chinese  , English and Japanese filter real oppositions in meaning out of the oppositions captured by analogies of form  . 
The number of sentences involved in at least one analogy is  13  , 602 , so that , more than one tenth of the sentences of the corpus are in an immediate analogical relation with other sentences of the corpus  . 
Such a figure is not negligeable.
Averaging those sentences involved in at least one analogy gives the figure of  162  ,  318 / 13 ,  602 = 11 . 93 ? true analogies ? , which indicates that , on average , there are ten different ways to obtain these sentences by analogy with other sentences  . 
It is questionable whether those analogies that were lost in the successive intersections were really not analogies on the meaning level  . In fact , the impression is that our experiment yielded a figure which is excessively low  . An inspection by hand convinced us that almost all analogies which were discarded would have been considered by a human evaluator as ? true analogies ?  . Figure 1 shows two such examples . The problem is that the corresponding translations in other languages did not make an analogy of form  . Other ways of saying could have made valid analogies of form  . Consequently , the low number of translation equivalents available in our corpus is responsible of the low number of ? true analogies ? found by this method  . 
5 A higher estimate : translation by enforcement of ? true analogies ?  5  . 1 Method The corpus we used is rather poor in translation equivalents  , or paraphrases : an English sentence gets only 1 . 2 0 equivalent sentences on average when translated into Chinese  , and only 1 . 52 into Japanese . If we would like to get a more accurate estimate of the number of ? true analogies ? in English  , then our problem becomes that of increasing the number of possible translations of English sentences in Chinese and in Japanese  , i . e . , to increase the number of paraphrases in Chinese and Japanese  . 
To address this problem , we adopted a view which is the opposite of our previous view  . We decided to enforce ? true analogies ?: given an analogy of form in a first language we forced it  , when possible , to be reflected by an analogy of form in the second language  . This should yield an estimate of the number of analogies in common between two languages which  , if not necessarily more accurate , will at least be a higher estimate . 
A1:B1::C1:D1 lll
A2: B2::C2: D2?
D1l

To do so , the formula mentioned in section 3 . 1 is used in production , i . e . , D2 is generated from the three sentences A2 , B2 and C2 when it is possible . 
5.2 Results
Using the method described above , we automatically produced Chinese translations for those English sentences of the corpus which intervene in at least one analogy of form  . This delivered an average of 51 different candidate sentences . As a whole ,  48 , 351 sentences among 53 , 250 could be translated . 
By doing the same for Japanese , the average number of different sentences is higher :  174 for 47  , 702 translated sentences 14 . ( For the reader to judge , Figure 3 shows examples of Japanese-to-English translations  , rather than English-to-Japanese . ) The obtained translations were added to the corpus so as to increase the number of paraphrases in Chinese and Japanese  . Then all counts were redone , and the new figures are listed under the title ? Higher estimate ? in Table  2  . 
5.3 Discussion
The new figure of 1 , 507 , 380 analogies for 49 , 0 52 sentences involved should be compared with the previous figures for the lower estimate  . It is much higher , but it seems closer to the impression one gets when screening the analogies : analogies of form which are not analogies of meaning are very rare  . 
However , the sentences that were obtained by enforcing analogies and then included in the corpus  , are not always valid sentences . Figure 3 shows some such examples . 
14 Here again , we suspect the cause of the difference to be the in different use of kanji and hiragana  . 
Future works should thus consider the problem of filtering in some ways the translations obtained automatically using  , for example , Ngram statistical models . After such a filtering , new counts should be performed again . However , the problem with such a filtering is that it may lose the morphological productivity of analogy  . 
6 Conclusion
In this paper , we reported experiments of counting the number of ? true analogies  , ? i . e . , analogies of form and meaning , between sentences contained in a large multilingual corpus  , making the assumption that translation preserves meaning  . We computed a lower and a higher estimates . 
Using an English corpus of almost 100 , 000 different sentences , we obtained a lower estimate of almost 70 , 000 ? true analogies ? involving almost 14 , 0 00 sentences by intersecting analogies of form between Chinese  , English and Japanese . 
A higher estimate was obtained by enforcing analogies of form  , i . e . , generating new sentences to fulfil analogies of form  , so as to increase the number of paraphrases . More than a million and a half ? true analogies ? were found  . They involve almost 50,000 sentences , i . e . , half of the sentences of the corpus . This meets our impression that almost all analogies of form between the English sentences of our corpus are also analogies of meaning  . 
Although we do not claim that analogy can explain everything about language  , this work shows that , even when considering the lower estimate obtained  , the number of ? true analogies ? that can be found in a corpus is far from being negligeable  . Further research should focus on the way analogies are distributed over sentences  , i . e . , on the characterisation of sentences involved in analogies  . 
Finally , as a speculative remark , similar countings as the ones reported above could contribute to the debate about ? the argument from the poverty of the stimulus ? if it were possible to reproduce them on such corpora as the CHILDES  corpus15  .
