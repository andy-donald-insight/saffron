This I ) a per presents an implemented multi-tal ) e two-level model capable of describing Semitie nonlinear morphology  . The computational fl'arne work behind the ettrrcnt work is motivated by \[ Kay  1987\]  ; the fimnal-ism presented here is an extension to the formalism reported by \[ Puhnanart  ( 1 Hepl ) le .  1993\] . The objectives of the current work are : to stay as close as possible  , in spirit , to standard two-level morl ) hology , to stay close to the linguistic description of Semitic stems  , and to present a model which can be used with ease by the Semitist  . The . Imperillustrates that if finite-state transducers  ( FSTs ) in a standard two-level morphology model are replaced with multitape att xiliary versions  ( AFSTs )  , one can account for Semitic root-and q ) attern morphology using high level notation . 
1 INTRODUCTION
This paper aims at presenting a computational morphology model which can handle the nonlinear phenomenon of Semitic morphology  . The approach presented here builds on two-level mori  ) hology\[Koskennienfi 1983\] , extending it to achieve the desired objective . Tit (' . contril ) ution of this l ) almrt nay \] ) e Sllll-marised as follows : With regards to the two-level model  , we extend this model by allowing it to have multiI  ) letapes on the lexical level and retaining the one tape on the surface level  ; hence , ' multitape two-level morphology ' . Feasi-ble pairs in the standard two-level model become ' feasible tuple pairs ' in our multitape model  . 
With regards to the formalism , we have . chosen a two devel formalism and extended it to be al  ) le to write multitape two-level grammars which involve nonlinear operations  . To achieve this , we made all lexieal expressions n-tuple regular expressions  . In addition , we introduced the notion of ' ellipsis ' , which in -* Supported by a Benefit ctor Studentship from SI+Jolm's College  . q ~ ll is research was done tlll d ( ! r the SU lm rv is io n < ffI ) rS teph ( ! nG .

181 3.2 Previous Proposals
Working within standard two-level morphology , \[Kataj and Koskenniemi 1988\] went around the problem . Nominal forms , such as/kitaab/'book ' , were entered in the lexicon . Vert ) alforms were derived by a ' lexicon component ' . A verb , such as/nkutib/(form7) , has the lexical entries n E1 u Eli El where El is the alphabet of the root and E ~ the alphabet of the vocalism/affixes  . Tim lexicon compovent takes the intersection of these two expressions and pro-duces/nkutib/  . Now/nkutib / is fed on the lcxi caltape of a standard two-level system wt fich takes care of conditional phonetic dmnges  ( assimilation , deletion , etc . ) and produces /' einkutib / , a A similar approach was used by \[ Lavie et al 1988\] for II ehrew using a ' pre-h!xical compiler ' . 
\[Kay 1987\] proposed a finite-state aplnoacl ~ using fimr tapes for root  , CV-skeleton , vowel melody and surface , each having an indel ) endent head , i . e . the machine can scan from one lexical tape without moving the head on other lexieal tapes  . The absence of motion is indicated by ad hoc notation coded in the lexical strings  . 
\[Beesley1991\] , working on Arabic , impleme , ited a two-level system with ' detours ' , where , according to \[ Sproat 1992 , p .  163-64\] , detouring involves nmltiple dictionaries being open at a time  , one for roots and one for templates with vowels precompiled  ( as in iI arris ' description )  . 
Other nontwo-level models were proposed ( there is no place here for a review of ttms e works  ) :\[ Kornai 1991\] proposed a model for auto segment all/honology using FSTs  , where nonlinear autosegmental representations are coded as linear strings  . 
\[llird and Ellison 1992\] proposed a modelllase do none-level phonology using FSA to model representations and rules  . \[Wiel ) e1992\]pr(llmsedI , l(Jdellii , gauto segmental phonology using multi-tal/e FSTs , where mi to segmental representations m'e coded in arrays  . 
\[Puhnan and Hepi ) le 1993\]prol ) osed a formalism for bidirectional segmental phonological processing  , and i ) roposed using it for Arabic . The next subsection presents the develoi ) ment of this formalism . 
3 . 3 Previous Formalisms\[Black et al . 1987\] pointed out ttmt previous two-level rules ( cf . , ~ a . 1 ) affect one character at a time and proposed a formalism wt fich mapstle tween  ( equal ram > be red ) sequences of surface and lexical characters of the form  , 
SURF ~ LEX alnidal consonant clusters , CC , take a prosthetic/Pi / . 
A lexical string maps l ; oa sllrfaees Lring iff they can be partitioned into pairs of lexical-sm'fi~ce  , subsequences , wtm reeach pair is licenced I ) y a rule . 
\[l\] . uessink 1989\] added explicit contexts and allowed unequal sequences  . \[Puhnan and IIepple 19931 ( level-oiled the l'ormalism further , allowing feature-based representations interpreted via unification  . 
The developed formalism is llased on the existence of only two levels of rel  ) resentation : sm ' face and lexical . 
Two types of rules are provided :
LSC-SuI~,"-I1. SC-->LLC-LF : x-B . LC
LSC-Sm~v-RS Cc > LLC-LEX-RLC where
LSC = h . ' ftsurfiu : econtext ~ IJllI , ' - - - Sllrface for tn
I /. SC-riKh tranface context
LLC = h'l't le.xical context
LI , : x = lexical form
ILC = right lexical conte.xt
The special symbol * indicates an empty context , which is always satisfied . The operator ~ states that lw , x't ttaysur\[itc . e , as StJIIF ill the given context , while the operator ?5 adds the condition that when LEx appears in the given context  , then the surface description must satisfy S1 HII . ' . ' Phelater caters for obligatory rules . 
The advantage of this Rn'malism over others is that it allows interalia mappings between lexical and surface strings of uneqmd lengths /! Rules  1-   3 can be expressed in this formalism as follows : a ?-X-*=>*-X-*  (  , l )  ? - - * ~ * -+-*  ( 5 ) ? --* < ~ v-e-+ ( 6 ) Pulman andllepi ) le proposed using the formalism for Arabic in the following manner : surface /  k'utti5/ call be expressed with the r/lle:?--Ct'tt .

pretixes , sutlixes , I ~ artic:les , prepositi<ms ) . Since char : acters in P ' . I'correspond to those on ST , P'F was chosen as PLT .

This lmpor has shown that a . muld-t : apoI ; wo-lovol approach using t:he Puhnan-I\[eplflO /ILuessinl?/Bhtcl ~ et al formalism with the  . extensions mentioned is capable of do . scribing the whole range of Arabic stems . 
Why do we need storage in the automata ? It is known that ml automaton with linitost orage can borOl  ) laeed with a larger ( me without storage ( : tsimt ) leso-hd . i(misi . odui ) licatol . hema (: hino for each case ); hence , 18 . q using finite storage ( especially with g_< 1 and a small finite set of I ' ) does not give the machine extral ) ower . 
The reason for using storage is to minimise the munher of machines and states  . 
With regards to the implementation , first we implemented a small system in order to test the usage of AFSTs in our model  . Once this wasest at ) lished , we made a second implementation based on the work of \[ Pulman and Hepple  1993\]  . Thisiml ) lementation differs fi ' om theirs as follows : Lexical expressions are n-tuples  , i . e . implemented as lists-of-lists instead of lists -of-characters  . A facility to check ellipsis in rules was added . The lexicon consists of multii ) le trees , one tree per tape . Finally , a morphosyntactic pro:set was added . 
Wc conclude this paper by looking at the possil ) ility of using our model for to imlhmguages . 
7.1 Beyond Semitic
This approach may be capable of des ( :rit ) ing other types of non-linear morphology , though we have not yet looked at a whole range , of examples . The following may formatheoretical franmwork for a number of non-linear phenomena  .

7.2 Future Work
Cm rently , we are looking at descrihing t l , e Semitic stem using mora k : \[ McCarthy and Prince  1990a \] and affixational \[ McCarthy 1992\] analyses of Semitics Lems . 
Another area of interest is to look at the formal properties of the formalism and of the AFSM  .
