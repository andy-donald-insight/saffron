Japanese Honorifics and Situation Semantics

Institute for New Generation Computer Technology ( ICOT ) Japan . 

A model of Japanese honorific expressions ill situation semantics is proposed  . Situation semantics provides considerable power for analyzing the complicated structure of Japanese honorific expressions  . The main feature of this model is a set of basic rules for context switching in honorific sentences  . Mizutani ~ theory of Japanese honorifics is presented and incorporated in the model which has been used to develope an experimental systom capable of analyzing honorific context  . Stone features of this system are described . 
1. Introduction
Tile Japanese language , like Korean and many no no Em ' opean languages , contains a grmmnaticalized system of Ironer ) tic forms . It is well known that the use of honor ) ties is closely connected to context , in e hating aspects like relatiw , social standing . No effective mechanisms have heen developed to deal with this problem  . Situation Semantics ( SS ) IBarwise 1982 , 1984a , 1984b , 1985a , 1985b , 1985c , 1985d , 1985 ell Barwise & Perry 1983\]\[l , experanee J\[Pollard 1985HCreary & Pollard \] is attmory of context used here to construct an m del of honorific sentences to analyze the relationship tmtween sentence and context  . 
About Japanese , we call make use of Mizutani's theory of honor ) lies \[ Mizutani 1983a , 1983b\] . This theory deestack letire relation between context and sentence  , but it seems that SS can describe context move usefldly than Mizutani's theory  . In this palter , SS is used to reconstruct the context given by Mizutani's theory  . Ilonorifie forms arc analyzed and basic rules flu ' context switching are established  . 
Table 1 gives the relation between Mizutani's theory of honorifles and the model  . This model can be divided into two parts . The first part describes basic context features and the second describes lexical rules based on Mizutani's Jal  ) anese grammar , along with some basic mechanisms of " context switching  . "

" We want to analyze this in future research . In this paper only enough elements for context required in Mizutani's theory are setup  . 
The main concern here is the second part of the model which deals with the relationship between contextual elements and lexical elements  , attd especially the mechanism of " context switching " onh on or  ) tics . 
Mizutani's theory of honorific exltression i Japanese is described first  . 
Then the model in ~ S is presented . The context feature of relative social status in Mizutani ' n theory is realized in the first part of the model  . This is followd by explanal : ionef some basic features designed to handle the mechanism of context switching in the second part  . Finally , au experimental system based on this model is given  . T iffs system was implemented in CfL ( Complex Indeterminate Imnguage ) \[Mukai 1985a , 1985b 1 . Results from some experiments processing Japanese honorific expressions are given at the end of the paper  . 
2 . Mizutani's theory of Japanese honorific expression  2  . 1 . Honorific Statustlonorific relations are represented as vectors in an abstract two dimens ional henorifie space  . In the honorific space the speaker in tim discourse is set a stile origin  . Other individuals like hearer and agents wire are presented in the sentence of discourse are represented by vectors as in the following example  . 
An honorific attitude is defined a stile vector between these points  . For example , the honorific attitude from tim speaker ( 1 ) to the hearer ( Y ) is defined as a vector fi'om I0 , 0) to Y ( yl , y2) . The honorific attitude fi'mn the
Ex . l\[
Agent A22 ( a21, a22) lte are rY(yl , y2)
Agent Al(all , al2) .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   . ) to , 0)
Illonorifie Space hearer Y to agent2 is defined as the vector fi'om ( yl , y2) to ( a21 , a22) , i . e . , the vector ( a2l-yl , a22-y2) . 
Next , we define the honorific wlluc and the dh'ection in the following way  , 
Definition 1 Honorific value
For t = < at , a2> , honorifie value of < t > - a2 iff al = 0 ; 0 iff al\=0 ; 
Definition 2 Honorific direction l ) Up < 1 > > 0 , 3) Flat < t >=0 Aal = 0 , 2)\]) own < t > < 0 , 4) A cross < t >=0 A al\=0 , We represent the " flat " ho nor , fie relation between agents explicitly , but the " across " relation is represented as in which there is no need to express the honor  , fie relation explicitly . For conventional use , we define the following dire et lons . 
5) any lupor down or flat .  6 )   any2 up or down or flat or across Teanalyz ettte sentence uttered  , definitions of tile following honorific relations are necessary  , Definition . 3 First order honorific relation The honer , fie attitude of the speaker to timhearer . 

D efinition4 Second order honorific relation The honorific attitude of tl  , e , ; peaker or tile hearer toward the agent in the sentence of discourse  . In this case the original point of tile vector should be tile point of the hearer or sl  ) eaker , whichever is higher . If I > 1\[ the original point of the vector will be l , att ( t if \] < I1 tile origin will H We introduce the notation J which stands for " tile higher individual  .

Now we can represent imrelation between these three honorific relations and the sentences of discourse  . Before looking at this honorific relation , we will show the small oumber of Japanese grammar rules used fo define the structure of sample Japanese seutenees  . This grammar is taken fi'om the " Sketeh of Japanese Gramlnar "\ [ Mizutani  1983al   , a part of which is shown in Figurel . This grammar is presented in CFG , but we give the rules in I ) CG .

These rules were included specifically to represent direct and indirect speech  .

The following relation holds between honorific relations and the sentence of discourse  . The notation "===>" means the left element has some effect on the right element  .

3 . 1 . First Part on Context Features 3 . 1 . 1 . Model of discourse In the theory of situation senmntics  , discourses are represented within situations and constraints  . Informal representation the sentence and context are expressed in the form " d  , c\[sentence\[s , e " . d stands for discourse situation ( l)U ) , c is the speaker's connection ( CS ) , s is a be setting and e is the described situation  . There is another situation called a resource situation in this theory  . In our model we define a resource situation for each individual  . 
( I ) Dhcourse Situation ( I ) U ) lIere is an example of the representation fa sentence in discourse  . 
Ex2. John said " Tommet Jane " to Jim.
el := loc , 10; yessaying John ; yes addressing John , Jim ; yesuttering " Tommet Jane " ; yes l0 < ld ( ld means discourse location ) Discourse situations are represented in the following form as series of terms expressing relations between speaker A  , hearer B and uttered sentence \]\ [ alpha \]\] . in SS ,   spatio4emporal location is defined in discourse situations , but we have no effective way to formalize it in our model  , so spatiotemporal location is not represented . 
DU := speaking A ; yes addressing , A , B ; yessaying , A , alpha ; yes ( 11 ) Speaker's Connection ( CS ) The speaker's connection is a series of the following types  . A is the actual object and \[ AI is the word that represents A  . 
CS := speaking A ; yes refers A\[A\] ; yes ( 111 ) Resource Situation ( RS ) A resource situation is defined for each individual in a discourse  ; it contains many events and constraints . 
RS := agent A ; yes has ; SOAs,
Constraints Necessary , Nomic , Conventional
Event type , , , , 3 . 1 . 2 . Honorific context in the sentence ( I ) Honorific Attitude Event type We introduce an " honorific attitude event type  ( Eh ) " which stands for an honorific attitude in Mizutani's theory  . 
Formula 1 ) represents the mind status ( HE ) of the speaker towards E h . 
A denotes the individual and " Itr " indicates that in then find of the individual A  , the honorific event type Ehis " represented . "Eh shows the external honorific event including social honorifics  . 
Formulas 2 ) through 5 ) represent he basic honorific attitude event types  ( Eh )  . In Mizutani's theory , this even type is represented as a vector , but were present i in the form of a binary relation  . For one example , in 2 ) " honor-up " denotes the honorific relation between individual standt '  . " ind t__ ; yes " denotes that t is an individual which can be represented in "" as its name  . 
Frame of Mind1)il E := Itr , A , Eh ; yes of t , _; yes of t ' ,  . r_; yes2)E h := honorupt , t '; yes ind t , _; yes ind t , __; yes3)E h := honor downt , t '; tyesindt , __;yes indt ' , __; yes4) Eh honor ~ across t , t ; yes ind t , __; yes ind t '; yes5)E h := h o n oreqt , t '; yes ind t ,  _  ; yes ind t'_ ; yes ( 11 ) Conditional Constraint on Word Selection In Section  2  . 3 . we described the relation between honorific context and grammatical rules  . This section corresponds to Section 2 . 3 . 
In Japanese there are many honorific words , and some interesting phenomena are to be found in daily life  . 
For example , a secretary in the company president's office should have many honorific words in his resource situation  ( RS ) because healways has to be careful to use the appropriate honorific expression in his wm'k  . On the other hand university students will have a poor stock of honorific words for there is no need to express honorific status  , except ot eachers . 
A constraint is required which determines the relation between the honorific event type  ( Eh ) and word representation . This is the " conditional constraint on word selection  ( Cw )  . " Mizutani's rules for first order through third order honorific relations given in  2  . 3 . correspond to this constraint Cw . Word representation should be an event type called " honorific word selection event  ( HW ) " , and if a person does not have this event type in his resource situation  , he or she will have a poor range of honorifics . We represent these Cw and HW in formula 6) . 
In formula 6) , " Cwl(Eh , ~ q " denotes the conditional constraint of word selection Cw which has E handanchor " f " as its conditional schema  . Anchor " f " determines the relation between in determinates in E h and objects like taro and hanako  . See Barwise's work for details .  6 ) is read : if Ebis factual and Cwis satisfied , then It W is actual . 
6) Cwl(E h , f := Involve Eh , llW ; yes
Conditional constraint on word selection has an honorific event type and its anchor as its scheme  . In Japanese honorific expressions , if E h and f are given , the word representation will follow very easily . Some instances of thls are given in formulas7 ) through 15 )  . For example , formula 7 ) can be read : if E his actual and the anchor f anchors t to individual J  ( J is the speaker or the hearer ) or t ' to A1 in the agent case , then hw is actu also that when refering to t ' honorific form tairen-go  ( np ) is added to the description

Second Part on The Relation between Context Features and the 
Sentence 3.2.1. C1L as basic language
Before going into the representation of lexical rules which give the correspondence between honorific word expressious and sentences  , and context switching on honorific sentences , we describe CIL used in the description of lexical rules  . Accurate accounts of C1L can be found in \[ Mukai 1985a  , 1985b\] . llere only the part needed to understand the lexical rules in section  3  . 2 . 2 is describe (\[ . 
CIL ( Complex Indeterminate Language ) can be represented by the following formula . 
CIL = Prolog + Parameterlzed Types + Freeze = Prolog+Frame+Freeze  . 
C 1L has the unique data structure called " complex indeterminate  . " This data structure can be regarded as a frame and represented as in the following example  . 
(1) term (( X with a := X , b := Y where X = Y )).
(2) > term(Z ), a!Z = abc , b!Z = abc.

Formula ( 1 ) is the specification of the data type and this can be used in formula  ( 2 )  . " a := X " means assign value X to slot a . " X = Y " denotes the condition part . If this condition is not satisfied the unification " term  ( X ) " in ( 2 ) will fail . Formula ( 2 ) utilizes the complex in determinate and unifies " abc " to each slot value  . 
3 . 2 . 2 . DCG Rules for honorlfies ( I ) First order bonorifics As Rule 1 in Section 2 . 3 . shows , first order honorifics affect " ps . " This is illustrated by the following examples . 
Ex . 3 This corresponds to Ehin11) in section 3 . 1 . 2 . 
ps(\[talX\] , X , Context ) <- d solve ( hono! ( (agent! ( ds!Context ) )! ( rs ! Context )  , eq(speaker\](ds ! Context ) , object!(lex!Context))) . 
, , < 2 , denotes the operator ":-" in Prolog\[Bowen 1982\]  . "\[ ta\]X\],X " is the DCG parsing mechanism . " Context " is a complex in determinate variable for the context for this parsing part  . " d solve " is a Prolog predicate with the following mechanism  . 
dsolve(X,Y ) . X is a list like \[ a , b , c , dl which contains Prolog at mns or terms . 
Y is a Prolog atom or term.
1) Search list X for Y .
2 ) If there is a term in X with the same arguments but differenter m name  , fail and return . 
3) if Y is not in X , then add Y to list X , succeed and return . 
4) lf Y is in X , succeed and return.
"hono! ( (agent! ( ds!Context ) )! ( rs ! Can text ) )" r presents a list of honorific event types in the resom'ce situation of the agent of discourse  . " object ! ( lex ! Context ) )" represents the lexical object in this parsing stage  . This tKaplan & Bresnaul , so this expression can be represented like ( ~ object ) in the LFG manner . 
This example states that if " ps "= taL then there should he honorific information i the resource situation of the individual who is the speaker  . 
If the speaker's RS contains two or nmre different erms expressing the honorific relationship between the same agents  , fail . Thus , the mechanism of 2 ) ind solve is very important because it shows that in the honorific information of one individual there should not be different information about the binary honorific relation between two individuals  . 
(11 ) Second order honorifics Lexieal rules for second orderlmnorifies can be represented as in following example program  . 
Ex . 4 This corresponds to Ehin 7) and 8) in Section 3 . 1 . 2 . 
np(X0 , X2 , Context ) <- n(X0 , XI , Context ) , sub3(X1 , X2 , Context ) , dsolve(honn!((agent!(ds!Context ))!( rs ! Context) , up(agenl , !(ds!X) , obj!(lex!X))) . 
(Ill ) Third order honorifics Lexical rules for third order honorifics can be represenl  ; ed as in the following example program . 
Ex . 5 This corresponds to Ehin10) in section 3 . 1 . 2 . 
vp(X0 , X2 , Context ) <- v(X0 , Xl , Context ) , suM(X ,   , X2 , Context ) , dsolve(hono!((agent!(ds!Context ))!( rs ! Context) , up(agenti(lex!X ) , obj!(lex!X))) . 
3 . 2 . 3 Context switching in honorific sentences When we utilize the contextual elements like I  ) S and RS in discourse it is very difficult to decide the context for each sentence  . A sentence in discourse can be represented by the expression " I  ) S , CS , I\[alptm\]\]S , E " , but then how do wenmp contexts like DS and CS to complex sentences ? Mizutani's theory of honorific forms does not go into context switching in a complex sentence  . So we have expanded his grammar and propose a basic mechanism for contcx~switching  . 
Consider sentence l ) belo wuttered by individual S to R which means " individual T said that individual U said that Tarometllanako  . " In this example , we establish relations a ) through j ) among S , T , U , Taro and ltanako . The operater > denotes the situation in which tim lefthand sidehonm's the right hand side  , < denotes the situation in which the right had side hmmrs the lefthand side  , and = denotes the situation in which there is no need to use honerifics between lefthand side and right hand side  . 
The main point in utterances of this fm'm is that honorifics in these sentence change according to the form of speech  , such as direct or indirect speech . Bu Lin the Japanese discourse there are no markers like "'" and "'"  , so in order to process these sentences correctly , we need the mechanism of " context switching . " Without his mechanism , all sentences wo nld be parsed with one context , but this cannot explain the reason why honorifics change in complex sentences  . 
1) In S's utterance he said to R("T said , U said , Taromettlanako " ) " taros a magahanakosamania in as a ( ta'to Ugaiwareta ' to Tgaiuta . 
In RS of Sa ) S > Tarob ) S > i lanakoc ) S > T d ) S > U e ) taro > hanako In IS of Tf ) T < U g ) ! l '= Taroh ) T < I lanakoi ) Taro < tlanako In RS of Uj ) U < T arok ) U <\ [ lanakol ) Taro > ftanako These are the parsing rules used to analyze utterances  . 
IA ) sentence --> an ( X) , ds!X = Y , agent ! Y = s , oh il Y = r , at ! Y = L , /* a , b , c , d , e*/honoi(s!(rsiX))=\[down(s , taro) , down(s , hanako ) , down(s , t) , down(s , u) , down(taro , hanako )\] , /* f , g , h , i*/honoi(ti(rs!X )) =\[ up(t , u) , eq(t , taro) , up(t , hanalm ) , up(taro , hanako )\] , /* j , k , I*/hono!(u!(rs!X )) =\[ u p(u , taro) , up(u , hanako ) , down(taro ,  . hanako)\] . 
b2) an(X)-->sn0(X).
L3) sn(X ) --> snO(X ),\ [ tol,s no(X),
L4) an ( X)-->sm , sn0(Y) , em , \[to\] , sn0(Z ) , agent !( ds!Y ) = agent\[Z , ds!X = ds!Z , obj !( ds!Y ) = obj!Z . 
LS ) sn(X)-->sn0(Y) , \[to\] , sn0(Z) , agent !( ds!Y ) = agent ! Z , dsiX = ds!Z , obj!(dsIY ) = ob . i!Z . 
LI ) and L2 ) are for nml rules to start the process , while L3) , L4 and LS ) are basic rules for determining context switch in sentences of discourse  . 
LI ) specifies the initial stage for parsing . In 1 ) above Stells R something so this context is set in the slot denoted by ds!X  . 
L2 ) states that all of the features of sn0 are transfered to satome et a requirement of Mizu  ( ani's grammar . This is done easily by unification . 
1 , 3 ) means that all of the featnres in sn0 are transfered to sn . This mechanism corresponds to indirect speech . 
L4) means that there should be context switch . As the discourse situation for sn0 , set agent of discourse of sn0 to agent of Z who utters sn0 and set object of diseom'se ofsn0 to object of Z who hears this utterance . 
L5) means that in a sentence with no marker , the recat ) be context switch , so if a parsing failed because of the context of honorifics  , use this rule . 
Sentence 1) is analyzed using rule 1 , 5 ) and the mechanism of context switch is dcerived fi ' omphase  ( I ) top hase 010 . 
( I ) Parsing really starts with the rule 3 ) estimating that there is no context switching . But at point *1 , a conflict between S's resource situation and honorific expression occurs  . In S's resource situation , the honorific relation between S and T arois down ( S , taro ) , but \[ taro , samal requests the honorific relation up(S , taro ) , so context switch occurs at *2 . Rule 5 ) switches the agent of discourse fi'om S to U . Context switch does not occur at this point again  . We use the notation I ) S ( S ) to state that the agent of discourse is S . The symbol --> means the context of lefthand side is changed to the context of the righthand sideas the result of context switch  .

IIItaros amagaha nakosamanio aun as attato Ugaiwar et ato Tgaitta  3  . 3 . Ch and Cw interesting feature of Cw . This constraint is not verified so with some trepidation we touch on it briefly here  . 
For example , when a worker " Suzuki " refers to his friend " Tanaka " with contempt  , he will intentionally use a polite word to refer to him such as " Tanaka sensei "  ( Mr . Tanaka ) . When the hearer ( Y ) bears this polite expression , hedcides on honorific event types but finds conflicts between these types and the normal social even types in his resource situation  . 
Ex . 6 expression \[ Tanaka sensei \] where Eh : = at h honorup  , Suzuki , Tanaka expression \[ Tanaka sensei \] where Eh := at l : honor down  , Suzuki , Tmml ~ ainRS of Yl IE := Iir Y , Eh;yes
E h := at lu:ho nor eq , Tanaka , Suzuki --> hearer find conflict and the hearer wonders why \[! Then the hearer  ( Y ) wonders why he broke the universal honorific event  . Finally , he comes to the conclusion that Suzuki intends either top raise Tanaka or be rate him  . We can go no further on this problem here . 
There are other aspects to Eh . If the sentence is given first , E h will be calculated for each word and there remains a possibility of conflict between honorific even types E h in a simple sentence  . In a complex sentence the mechanism of context switch will be used  , but in a simple sentence this mechanism is not effective  . When the hearer tries to deal with this conflict , he or she will assume that the speaker has some illegal honorific constraint Ch '  . We have implemented this mechanism in our model system  . 
4. System Configuration
Our experimental system written in C1L runs on the DEC 2060 and utilizes Prolog as the basic programming environment  , which enables us to use CIL .   C1L is now compiled and runs very fast on DEC 2060  . Next , we want to run this I ) CG parser on the Bottom UpParser\[Matsumoto 1983\]  , \[ Matsumoto , Kiyono , 1984\] . 
5 . Some Other Examples\[ntiffs section , we give some examples which have no relation to context switching  .

Conclusion It is easy to model honorific context in situation semantics  . But we don't know how this context is represented in the human mind  . This requires further esearch . 
This treatment of the context switching mechanisms of honorifics is a first step toward analyzing more complicated phenomena  . The main contribution ~ ) f this model derives from the fact that in any complex sentence  , there will probably be context switching on honorifics  . .But this model shows context switching in a complex sentence only and tttere remains more complicated phenomena like the following  . 
Stlanako somania Lta'\[ttanakosama\] is a honorific fm'm  ( 1 metIlanake . ) R " llanako samattc dare ?' ( Who is " Ilanako "? ) 
I---$1-I
S'Tanaka Ilanako'(tlanako Tanaka)
R ' A a , honanoy atsuka'\[hana \] is nonhonorific form  ( Oh , liana ! )   $1 is the direct speech act and ttmre should be a context switch because when Rk nows wholl anako is  , he refers to her with the nonhonorific " liana . " But we do not formalize the context switch which decides who is the agent of sentence  $1  . To solve this problem , we should use an " anaphora mechanism for the honorific context " and in order to build a firm model of this mechanism  , study not only of the anaphora mechanism I Barwise  1985c1 but also the focusing mechanism\[Sidner\]is required  . These also are topic for filrt bcr research . 
ACI(NOW lA~\]DGEMEN'rS1 would like to thank Mr . Mukai of \[ COT for his comments on context switching and Mr  . Yokoi , the lleod of the Second Research Laboratory at ICOT  , for his encouragement and for allowing n mample time for this work  .
