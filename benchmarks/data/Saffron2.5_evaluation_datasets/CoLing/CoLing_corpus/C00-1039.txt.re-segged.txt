Abstract
A reasonably simple , domain-independent , largescale approach of lexictd semantics to paraphrase recognition is presented in this paper  . It relies on the enrichment of morphosyntactic rules and the addition off burboole an syntactico -semantic features to a set of  1  . , (23 words . It results in a significant enhancement of precision of  30% with a slight decrease in recall of 10%  . 
1 Overview
The recognition , of paraphrases and variants is an important issue in several areas of infornm-tion retrieval and text mlder standing  . Merging paraphrastic sentences iln proves ummarization by avoiding redundancy  ( Barzilay et al ,  1999) . 
Term variant conilation enhances recall in in -t brmation retrieval by pointing at documents that contain linguistic variants of  ( tuery terms ( Arampatzis et al ,  1998) . 
In ( Jacquemin and Tzoukermann ,  1999) , a technique is proposed for the conflation of morphosyntactic variants that relies solely on morphological and low-level syntactic features  ( part-of-speech category , munber agreement , morphological relationships , and phrase structure ) . An analysis of these results shows the limitation of this approach : correct and incorrect variants cannot be separated satisfactorily on a purely morphosyntactic basis  . Sonic additional lexical semantics must be taken into consideration  . 
In this study we propose a reasonably simple , domain-independent , largescale approach of lexical semantics to noun -to-verb variant recognition  . It relies on the mere addition of two t ) oolean syntactic features to 449 verbs and two boolean morphosemantic features to 574 nouns . It result , ; in a significant enhancement of precision of 30% with a slight decrease in recall of 10%  . This newal ) proaeh to semantics -- human-based , ettlcient , involving simple linguistic t batures -- convincingly illustrates the positive role of linguistic knowledge in information processing  . It confirms that verbs and their semantics play a significant role in document analysis  ( Klavans and Kan ,  1998) . 
2 Morphosyntactic Approach to
Nomino-verbal Variation
In order to illustrate the contribution of semantics to the detection of paraphrastic structures  , we focus on a specific type of w triation : the vo . rl ) alvarbmts of Noun-Preposition-Noun terms o1" compounds in French . For example , lescorttraintes rdsiduellcs darts lescoques sont an a Iysdes  ( the residual constraints in the shells ~ re mialyzed  ) is such a vert ) alvariant of analyse decort traint c ( constraint analysis )  . 
As a baseline t br the extr~mtion of these variants  , we use a set of five morphosyntactic rans -tbrmations fbr Noun-Preposition-Noun terms reported in  ( Jacquemin and Tzoukernlann , 1999) ( see Table 1) . 1We use the notation Ad(Ni ) v for ; tie in or phological in k between the initial term and the trans-ibrmed structure  . Itrel ) resents any verb in the same morphological fanfily as  Ni  . 
For instance , in English , and according to the CELEX database , Ad ( analysis ) v = to analyze , top sychoanalyze . 
Given a NIP 2N8 structure , these transt'ornm-tions are obtained through corpus-based tuning  1The following symbols are used for syntacticate -gories : N  ( nou I0 , A ( adjective ) , Av(adverb ) , V ( verb) , C(coordinating conjunction ) , P ( pretosition ) , and D(de-tcrminer ) . In the regular exlressions , ? denotes optionality and I disjunction . Morphologically related words are underlined .

For instance , rule N head qlb Vl / , ev corresl ) onds to transfi ) rmations in whi (: h the , head noun is morphologically re , 1 ; ~t( ; d to the verl ) and t : h( ; or d('r of the two words is re , verse(l ; rul ( ; Nmodit'FoV(modifier transfi)rmed , order r ( ; -rained ) has been divided into two sul ) ruh ; s : the first one-Nmo(t if YoV 1-re , quires the insertion of apr ( ; positiou just 1)eft ) reth ( ; verbal form . 
3 The Limits of the
Morpho-syntactic AI ) proach
In the tirst step of this work , we ext ) e(:tedth( , precision of wu : iant recoglfition to be controlled in two ways : first ty  , by searching fi ) r multiterm variants in which the two content words of the initial term are foul M  , directly or via mor-1) hological transformation . Se (: on dly , by dell1>ing morpho-syntacti (: pa ; te . rns of variation in I ; erms of l ) art-of-sl ) eech strings that are allowed to come in 1 ) e . tween the set ; woCOlll ; elttwords . 
Yet , the sequences found on su ( ; hamorl ) ho-synl ; acti ( : basis prove to 1 ) e of w trying quality regarding their at/ility to t ) rovide t ) arat ) hrases of the initial l ; erm . Consider for instance some of l ; hevm : imlts del , eeted for the term comparai-sonderds ' ultat ( comparison of results )  , in which only t ; 11( ; \[ irst ;   ; we sequences are good variants : compareles rdsultats  ( (: onlpare the results )   ( rule N head ~ lbV , pattern A4(N1) vDNa)r&ultatsezp drirnc . ntauz sent compar & ( exI ) er-imental results are compared )   ( rule N head-to V Rev , 1) atte . rnNaAVA4 ( N ~) v)com , pard . sa'ux'rds ' . ,ltats ( COmlmred to the results )   ( rule NheadToV , pattern
Jt4 ( N1 ) vPN : ) rds ' ult dd " unceomparaison ( resulted from ; t comparison ) ( rule N Modii To V Rev , pattern
J ~ d(Na)vP DN1)
Such examples show that morpho-syntactie patterns ; ~ re1 ; oo coarse-gr~tined to ensure l ; hat the dependency relation between the two pivots  ( results is the object of the predie a ? e comparison  ) is maintained . When trying to detine linguistic criteria to ew fluate such w ~ riants  , it ; apt ) ears that the frontier between good and load variants lies between those that preserve the argument relation  1  ) etween the two content words and those that disrupt it  . This means that , in the verbal w triant , the . argument relation between the verb and l ; he noun must bel ; he same as t ; here lal ; io 11 between the deverl ) all OUll add the othe . r noun in the nominal term . 
None of the five rules ensures that the subcategorization frame is preserved  . For instance , if we consider t ; 11 orule NMod if I'o Vlev , we find se-that violate it2: cr ' it drcd ' & aluation ( evaluation criterion ) -+ dvalv , dsel on lescrit ~ r'cs ( evahmted according to the criteria ) syst~med'dvaluation ( evaluation system ) * --+ dvaht 6 lcsyst&ne ( evaluated the system ) In the second case , the transtbrmation is unacceptable because the instrumental relation expressed in the nonfinal term becomes an object relation in the verbal sequence  . Even when word order is preserved , the relation between the pivots can be totally different in the term and its transformation  , as i . u : contrgIed ' installation ( installation control ) and contrgle ccntralisd install d ( installed centralized control )   ( rule NMod it To V2 )  . 
Our aim was to tbrmulate additional constraints in order to control argument structure preservation  . We thus had to cope with problem of handling nonfinal t  ) hrases ( NP ) in which one of the elements is morphologically inked to a verb  . In French , as in English , the semantics of these nominal phrases is an issuet br linguistic description : the two nouns can be linked by the whole range of argmnent -predicate relations  , and very few linguistic elements can be used to decide what relation is expressed  . Here is a brief list of the configurations that are likely to appear in such NPs : - the second noun is the object of the first  ; one : compara is on derd sultat ( comparison of result ) -the second noun is the subject of the first one : augmentation deI ' in tcv  , sitd ( increase in intensity ) -the second noun is an adjunct : tr ' aitcment g lach aleur  ( treating with heat ) the first noun is an adjunct : taux d ' augmentation  ( increase rate ) Our aim was to find a way to use surface linguistic knowledge  , as required in such an area of NLP , to deal with the interpretation of these phrases . 
4 Light Semantics for
Nomino-verbal Variations
Our approach consisted of two steps : firstly , defining semantic luest braccepting or discard -sin what follows ~ the symbols --~ and *----> respectively indicate correct and incorrect rans formations ing variants and  , secondly , defining new variation patterns based ollthese features  . 
4.1 Filtering Criteria
First , using linguistic results on the semantics of French NPs  ( Fabre , 1996; Bartning ,  1990) , we identified predicate-argument configurations that cannot be matched by a given pattern  ( ' reject'heuristics in the sense of ( Lapata ,  1999)) . 
For example , when rule N mod if To VR ev applies , N1 deN3 terms cannot bei ) araphrased by verbal sequences in which N1 is the ol ) ject of the verb , as in : ezp&ienccd'utilisation ( experiment of use ) * -+ utili sait ' urice zpdrier ~ , cc(used an experiment ) . In such a configuration , only non--thematic arguments ( adjuncts ) of the deverbal noun may be tbund inside the NP . 
Similarly , when rule N head To VR ev applies , N\] de N3 terms cannot be paraphrased by verbal sequences in which N\] is the subject of a transitive verb  , as in : utilisation del'ezp&'icnce ( use of experiment ) * -+ czp drien ccutilisant ( ex-t ) eriment using )  . 
This configuration provides variants only when the verb is intransitive or ergative : ergative verbs allow tbralternations of the tbrm : NP V  ( lad cnsit dau . qrncntc)/one VNP ( on a wl-montelad cns itd ) . 
In this case , the tbllowing transtbrmation is correct : augmentation dedensit d  ( density increase ) /de , , , ,s'itd av , 9' ment c(density increases ) . 
4.2 Enriched Metarules
Once it has 1 ) een establish edwtfich transformations should be rejected  , we searched tbr surface linguistic clues that could help us to filter out these undesirable variants  . It led us to the redefinition of the metarules , in two ways : putting additional constraints on the part of speech strings that can intervene between the two pivots  , and defining new features to add linguistic control upon the application of the rules  . 
The set ~ atures are : the prepositional form , the morphological type of the noun , the transitivity of the verb , and the voice ( active versus passive ) . 
Here are two examplest br the redefinition of the metarules  ( fllrther details and examples are given in table 3  ) : rule Nmod if ToV Rev In this case , the metarule is transtbrmed into a single of parts of sl  ) eech is mot (  ; res ; riel ; ed : a preposition is required to el infinate object reinions from the verbal phrase  .

5 Experiments and Evaluations

Precision and Recall
In order to calculate the precision and recall of the rich and poor metarules and to estimate the gains of semantic enrichment  , a set of 1 , 0 00 cooccurrences has been randomly chosen among the 159  , 898 cooccurrences retrieved by the system . They have been divided into three sets : S1 ( 500 cooccurrences ) and S2 and S ~ ( 250 cooccurrences )  . S~has been evaluated independently by the two judges  ( i . e . the two authors )

The problem of linguistic vari-ation in information processing forces the linguist to reconsider parat  ) hrase and trm~sf'orma-tion mechanisms in a new perspective  , based on real linguistic data and on systematic or t  ) usexploration . The paraphrase judgment is evaluated in a new way  , from a practical point of view : two sequences are said to be a paraphrase of each other if the user of an information system considers that they bring identical ors in > ilar information content  . Regarding linguistic methodology , this work le dust of ind " light " solutions in terms of lexical encoding to describe complex semantic t  ) he nomena . This approach is pronfising because it demonstrates that linguistic knowledge can really enhance the results of term recognition beyond the  , nor phology level , and that semantics can be taken into account to sonm extent  .
