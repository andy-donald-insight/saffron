1 Introduction
Reusability of existing linguistic knowledge is the most import  , ~ mt requirement for the rapid development of pra . ctical nal , ural \] augtlagel ) rocessing systems . In order to realize , automatic ustomizatiou of existing linguistic knowledge to each applicat  ; ion domain , we proposed a new approach of linguistic knowledge acquisition  , which is a combination of symbolic and statistical approaches \[ Kiyono and Tsujii  ,  1993\] . 
The fi : a mework of our al ) proach is shown in Figure 1 .

2 Grammar Hypothesizing 2 . 1 Grammar Formal i sm The grammar lbrlnalisnl we use is a conventional uniIication-based grammar  . F , achgram Lnar rule is written in the form of a combination of a conl  , ext-free rule and feature unilication functions . This R ) rmalism is not specitic to any linguistic ~ ; heory , but we in l . ro-duced a number of concepts widely accepted in lil  , -guisl , ic theories , such as grammatical fmctions , sub-categorization ' ralLies , aimXbar theory . 
' FILe parsing system we introdttced 1 , 11 all plyourgrammarl brlnalism is as ysl , enl called SAX\[Mat-smnoto ,  1986\] . SAX uses the concepts of act , iw ~' and in active edges of Chart P~lrsing and analyses an input sentence with a bottom-up and parallel algoril  ; hm . 
As the grammar hyl ) othesizi LLg algorithm is supposed l : o refer partial parsiug results of unsuccessflfly parsed sentences  , we slightly modified SAX so that itou / . lmts in active edges as partial parsing results . 
837 2.2 Basic Algorithm
When SAX fails to parse a sentence , no in active edge of category 5' sl/anning the whole sentencc exists in the parsing result  . Grammartly pothesizing is a process to introduce this in active edge by augnlent mg the current gramnmr  . The basic part of the hypothesis generation algorithm is written as f bllows : \[ Algorithm \] An in active edge lie  ( A ) : a:o , '%1 Call be introduced from x0 to x , ~ , with label A , by each of the \] lypotheses generated by the following two steps  . 
\[ Step1\] For each sequence of inactive edges , lie(B1):: r0 , Xl\] ,   .   .   . ,\[ ie(Bn): . V n_l , a:n\] , spanning from x0 to x ~ , generates a yew rule . 
A :=>/31,- .   .   , Bn\[Step2\]For each existing rule A-~AI ,   .   .   .   , A n , find a nine onlplete sequence of inactive edges , lie(A1): x0 , xl \] ,   .   .   .   , \[ ie(Ai_l ) : xi - ~ , Xi_l\] , \[ ie(Ai + l ) : : ci ,   . r : i + l\] .   .   .   .   , \[ ie(A , ) : : , : , ,_~ , x , ~\] , and call this algorithmibr\[ie(Ai):xi1 ,   . vii . 
Feature Structures : A rule generated in \[ Step 1\] could be a lexieal entry when this topdown algorithm reaches the bottom  . As we adopted a unification-based grmnmar fbrmalism  , we extended the algorithm so thai , it can hyt ) othesize a feature structure of a lexical entry by observing surrounding successful categories  . As the algorithm works even ibrae Oml ) lex feature like a subcategorization frame , it can be used to acquire a subeategorization dictionary  . While some previous works on subcategorization fi ' alne acquisition assumed very little prior knowledge concerning the classification of subcategorization frames \[ Brent  , 1991; Manning ,  1993\] , our a pllroach assumes the existence of grammar rules Sllecifying subcategorization fi'ame assignment  , which enables more accurate learning of subcategorization frames  . 
Multiple Defects : In \[ Step 2\] of the algorithm , it is SUl ) t ) osed that each unsuccessfully parsed sentence has exactly one cause of failure but a sentmte e in actual texts often contains two or more causes of failure  ( for example , two unknown words ) . To solve this problem , we extended the algorithm so that it searches for a multiple hypothesis which is a set of rewriting rules and lexlcal entries  . 
3 Hypothesis Selection 3 . 1 Bas ic Grammat ica l Const ra in ts From a linguistic point of view  , hypotheses generated by the algorithnl given above might contain n lany unnatural hypotheses because the algorithm itself does not have any linguistic knowledge to judge the appropriateness of hypotheses  . To remove unnatural hypotheses , we have introduced the following criteria \ [ Kiyono and Tsujii  ,  1993\] . 
? The maximum number of adjacent unsuccessful categories is set to  2 in order not to decrease the efIi-ciency of the algorithm  . 
? The lnaxil nuln nulnber of daughter nodes is set to  3  . 
? Supl ) osing that the existing grammar contains all the category conversion rules  , ammry rule which has only one daughter node is not generate  . d . 
? Using generalizations embodied ill the existing grammar  , a hypothesis contaiuing a sequence of subnodes which are collected into a larger category by existing gramma rules is not generated  . 
? Distinguishing non-lexieal categories from lexica  . l categories , a hypothesis whose mother category is a lexical category is not generated  . 
? Assuming that tile existing gramznar has a complete set offllnctional words  , a lexical hypothe~sisi restricted to the open lexical categories  , uc has noun , verb , adjective , and adverb 3 . 2 Const ra in t based on / meal Boundar ies A new constraint on the violation of the boundary condition given to phrases was introduced to avoid any collection of adja/:ent successfifl categories in rule hypothesizing  . The bomnlary condition is given by putting parentheses at both ends of a phrase  , such as a noun phrase , a verb l ) hrase , and a prelmsitional phrase . This constraint iltersout a hylm thesis which crosses either end  , not both ends , of a phrase . For example , when parentheses are put like "\[ Tile default blocking factor \] is  \[20 blocks \]" , ahyl ) othesis ' VP='e VP , NP , VE'R . BBIs "' covering " blocking factor is " is discarded because of the violation of the boumlary condition of a noun phrase " The defimlt blocking factor " This constraint requires the hunlant ask of putting parentheses before the hypothesis generator is invoked  . 
hi comparison with writing a constituent structure of tile whole sentence  , this work is much easier because we have only to give parentheses to delinite phrases  . 
Moreover , instead of giving parentheses by hand , we can even obtain various tagged corpora . 
As this constraint is also atlplieable to other constituents of the input sentence  , it might improve the etliciency of the topdown hypothesizing algorithm  . 
3 . 3 Const ra in t based on Xbar Theory Most of the criteria in  3  . 1 are based on linguistic category classification but none of them commits itself to dealing with ther cla  . tionship among then lother node and the daughter nodes  . For example , supposing the existing granmmr does not contain a rule for participial adjuncts ill  t10UU phrases , the hypothesizing program generates a new rewriting rule ' NP ~  . VP , NP't?om the phrase " blocking tactor " in the sentence " The default blocking factor is  20 blocks " . I lowever , tile program also general , es other alternative hyt ) otheses from the same phrase , such as ' PP ~ VP , NP ' , ' INFINIg'IVI'~~VP , NP ' , and ' THAT_CLAUS'I , /~ VP , NP ' , each of which derives a .   1lost-positional adjunct for " default " by believing " default " is a head noun of the noun phrase  . Liuguisli-cally , such combinations of nlother nodes and daughter nodes are not allowed  . 
As a general ) rinciple for explaining phrase structures , Xbarlheory is widely accepted . According to Xbar theory , a grannna rule is ( or can be converted to ) either of the following for lns , where each prime ( ' ) expresses the l ) rojection level of ' a head X . Thel ) rojec-tion level increases as gramn la rules are applied and X" is called a maa:imal projection of that category  . U and W are adjuncts of X ' and should I ) emaximal projeetions of some ca . tegories .

The weighting function explained ill 3 . 4 was not used for selecting hypotheses but tim validity of it was proved by counting the order of each plausible hypothesis in the set of generated hypotheses  .
