In this paper , we introduce , a two-layered interpretation model . In a first ; pass , dependency graph structures which result fl'om in ( : remental parsing are immediately submitted to a semantic in tcrl  ) reta-tion process . Such a process is triggered by general schemata whenever a semantically interl  ) retable subgraph of a syntactic dependency gral ) ht ) ecomes ava . ilable(el . Section 3) . As a result , lexical items and the del ) endency relations holding 1 ) etwe . en them are directly mat ) ped to associated concel ) tual entities mid relations at ; the level of semantic representation ( cf . Sections 4 mtd 5) . In a subsequent steI ) , the ( quasi-inferential ) iml ) lications of the knowledge representation structures emerging from the semantic interpretations tet  ) are accounted for l ) ya pro-eess we here refer to as concepl , ' aal interpretation . 
The ( : or resl ) onding ot ) erations relate to the ( : ( mcel ) -tua \] representation level only and are triggered by a variety of production rules rooted in ontological categories in order to generate a canonical conceptual representation f the parsed sentence  ( el . Section 6) . This second level of interpretation is usually not taken into consideration by computational models of semantic interpretation  , either constituency-based nor ( lei ) endency-based ones , although it turns out to crucial for natural anguage '  , , ndeTwtandin . q . 
2 Grammar and Concept Knowledge
Grammatical knowledge for syntactic analysis is t ) ased on a fully texicalized dependency gl ' alllltla  \]   ( Itahn et al ,  1994) .   ( ) ur preference for dependency structures is motivated  , among other things , t ) y the observation that the corresl ) ondence of det ) endency relations ( holding between lexical items ) to con ( : ep-tual relations ( holding between the , concepts they denote ) is much closer than t . ' or constituency-based grammars ( I lajicova ,  1987) . Ilence , a dependency-based al ) i ) roach cases inherently the descrit ) tion of the regularities mMerlying selnantic in l ; erl)retation .

Inher-itance of grammar knowledge is based on the idea that constraints are attached to the most general lexeme classes to which they apply  , leaving room for more and more specific ( possibly , even idiosyncratic ) specifications when one descends this hierarchy . 
A dependency grammar captures binary constraints between a syntactic head  ( e . g . , a noun ) and one of its possible modifiers ( e . g . , a determiner or an adjective ) . In order to establish a dependency relation ~ C : D := specifier  , s ~ fl~iect , dir object ,   . . . between a head and a In odifier , lexenle-class-specific constraints oil word order  , comt ) atit ) ility of In or-phosyntactic features and senmntic integrity must be fifl filled  . Figure 2 depicts a dependency graph in which word nodes are given in boldface and dependency relations are indicated I  ) y labeled edges . 
Conceptual knowledge of the underlying domain is expressed in terms of a KL-ONE-like knowledge representation language  ( Woods and Schmolze ,  1992) . 
The domain ontology consists of a set of concei ) tnames 9 r := COMPANY , tIAI~I)- . DI . g\[<, . . . and a sub-sunl I ) tion relation is af = ( HAIiD-DISK , NTOHACF-DF VICF) , ( TRANS'rI . : (~', COMPANY ), . . . C ~ P x Y . The set of relation nantes ? g:--IIAS-t 'All  ; F ~ I)EI , IVEI~-AGENT ,   .   .   . denotes con ( : eptual relations which are also organized in a subsmnption hierarchy is a ? z =  ( ttAS-IIARI ) -DISK , It AS-PItYSICAL-PAVI') , ( IlAS-PHYSICAL-PAR . T , It A . q-PAltSI'), .   .   .   . 1 Examples of emerging concept mid relation hierarchies are depicted in Figure  3   ( right box )  . 
Illourat ) proach , the representation languages for semantics and domain knowledge coincide  ( for arguments supporting this view , el . Allen (1993)) . Linking lexical items and concet ) tual entities proceeds as follows : Upon entering the parsing process  , each lexical iter n w that has a ( : onceptual correlate C in the domain knowledge base  , w . CEY ( mostly verbs , Ilouns and adjectives ) , gets immediately instantiated in the knowledge base  , such that for any instance Iw , initially , 2 type(I , ,) = w . Cholds ( e . g . , w=:'Fest-platte ", I , ,,= HAID-Dlst,: . 2, w . C = type(HaI ~ . D-DISK . 2) = HARD-DISK) . If several conceptual correlates exist , either due to honmnymy or polysemy , IAt l sllb stllnpl ; io Il , elations , is a w , is a:v , and is w ~ , arc considered to be transitive and reflexive .

3 Interpretable Subgraphs
II1 the parse tree from Figure 2 , we can distinguish lexical nodes that have a conceptual correlate  ( e . g . , " Fcstplatte " relating to HAlD-DIsK , " gelicfert " relating to DEIAV h ; RY ) from others that do not have Such a correlate ( e . g . , " mit " ( with ), " yon " ( by)) . Semantic interpretation capitalizes oil this distinction in order to tind adequate conceptual relations between the corresl  ) onding concept , insta . nces : Direct Linkage . If two word no ( tes  with ( : once t ) -tual correlates are linked by a single depen ( ten ( : y relation , a direct linkage is given . Such a subgraph can immediately be interpreted in tern is of a  ( : on-ceptual relation licensed by the correspondiit g de-l  ) endency relation . This is illustrated in Figure 2 by the direct linkage between " Fest platte " ( hard disk ) and " Computers " via the gen\[itive\]att\[ribut ( ~\] relation , which gets nmpped totile IIARD-DISK-OF role linking the corresponding con  ( : eptual correlates , viz . 
HARD-DISK . 2 alld C ( ) MPUTER-,~YSTFM . 4, respectively ( see Figure 4) . This interpretation uses only knowledge about the concet  ) tual correlates and the linking dependency relation  .

For such a " nfinimal " sut ) grat ) h , semantic in-tert ) retal ; ion is made dependent on lexical information from the  , intervening nodes , as well as knowledge aboul ; the conceptual correlates and del ) cn ( lencyi'e-lations .

In oMer to increase tile generality and to t ) reserve the simi ) licity of semantic interpretation we introduce a generalization of the notion of del  ) emlency relation such that it incorporates direct as well as indirect linkage : Two content words  ( nouns , adjectives , adverbs or flfll verl ) s)stand in a'me . dialed syntactic relation , if one cant ) as s from one word to the other along the connecting edges of the  ( tcl ) en- ( tency gral ) h wit ; hour traversing word nodes other than t ) repositions , modal or auxiliary verl ) s(i . e . , elements of e h ) s ed w oM classes ) . In Figure 2, e . g . , the tuples (" F cst platt c . ", " Co ' m , p ', , ter . s ") or ("6' om , -putcrs " , "350 Mh , z-CPU " ) stand in mediated syntac-tit relations , whereas , e . g , , the tuple (" Fest , platt c " , " Tra'nstcc ") does not , since the comiecting 1) at hCOlt-rains " gelicfc . rt "( dcliv crcd ), a(;Ollt ; ell ; word .

4 Semantic Interpretation Model
The model of semantic intert ) re . tatiol ~ wel)rOl)OSe(:Oral ) rises two (: on sl , raint layers . First , sl , atic ( : on-straintsfl ) rsemmltic intert ) retation derived from directly mapping dependency relations to conceptual roles  , and , second , a search of the knowledget ) as e which dynamically takes these static constraints into account  .

Dynamic Constraint Processing . Semantic interpretation implies a search in the knowledge base which takes the constraints into account that derive fl'om a particular dependency parse tree  . Two sorts of knowledge then lmve to be combined- -first  , a pair of concepts for which a connecting relation path has to be determined  ; second , conceptual COl > straints on permitted and excluded conceptual relations when connected relations are being computed  . 
The first constrainty peine or porates the content words linked by the semantically interpretable subgraph  , the latter accounts for the pm'ticular dependency relation  ( s ) holding between them . Schema ( 1 ) describes the most general mapping fl'om the coil -ceptual correlates  , h . C from and 11 t . Cto ~ ill ~ of tile two syntactically linked lexical items  , h and m , respectively , to connected relation paths 12 ~ o , , . .

"; : ( CI, . o , ,~  ,  12+ ,  12-  , C , o ) ~12 ~ o ~ , , (1) A connected relation path rel~o , , C R . . . . is defined by : relcon((rt , . . . , rn )) : ?:;' ViC1, . . . , n - 1 : A relation path is called connected , if for all its n constituent , noncomposite relations ri the concept type of the domain of the relation ri+l subsumes the concept ype of the range of the relation ri  . 
To compute a semantic interpretatiol ~ , si triggers a search through the knowledge base and identifies all commeted relation paths from Cf  ~  . o , , to C to . Due to potential conceptual ambiguities in interpreting syntactic relations  , more than one such path may exist ( hence , we mat ) to the power set of 12 ~ o , ~) . In order to constrain connectivity , si takes into consideration all conceptual relations  12+ CTdapriori permitted for semantic interpretation  , as well as all relations R_C 7~ a priori excluded . Both of them reflect the constraints set 11t ) by particular ( lel ) endency relations or noncontent words figuring as lexical re-lators of content words  . Thus , tel GR~o , , holds , if tel is a connected relation path from Cf ,  . o , ,~ to Cto , obeying the restrictions imposed by 12+ and 12_ . 
If the fllnction si returns the empty set ( i . e . , no valid interpretation can be comtmted ) , no dependency relation will be est at ) lished . Otherwise , t brall resulting relation paths RELiEI ~ conan assertional axiom of tile form  ( h . C fro , nI ~ . ELim . Cto ) is added to the knowledge base , where RELi denote stile i threading . If i > 1 , conceptual ambiguities occur , resolution strategies for which m'e described ill
Romaclmr and Hahn (2000a).
To match a concept definition C againstile constraints imposed by  12+ and 12_  , we define the function get-roles(C ) = : CR , where C12 denotes the set of conceptual roles associated with C  , which are then used as starting points for the path search  . For ease and generality of st)ecification , R + and li~_consist of the most general conceptual relations only  . Hence , the concrete conceptual roles CR and the general ones in R + and R_may not always be compatible  . 
So prior to semantic interpretation , we expand I2+ and R_into their transitive closures , incort ) orating all their subrelations in the relation hierarchy  . Thus , 12; :--, . * eI , '12+: is , , .   . R *_ is correspondingly defined .   12+ restricts the search to relations contained in C12 rq 12"4-  , iffR + is not empty ( otherwise , all elements of C12 are allowed ) , whereas 12_ allows only for relations in C12  \  12"_  . 
5 A Sample Semantic Interpretation
Whenever a semantically interpretable subgraph is complete  , selnantic interpretation gets started in l -mediately  . As an example , we will consider a case of indirect linkage , as illustrated by the occurrence of auxiliary and modal verbs within a passive clause  . 
When interpreting indirect syntactic relations , in-fl ) rmation not only about content word nodes but also about intervening noncontent word nodes becomes available  . This way , further static constraints are imposed on R + ( and 12_ ) in terms of a list RI ~ . ~ . 
CT  ~ . of permitted conceptual relations . This information is always specified at the lexcme level  . Since 12 t ~: ~ relates to closed-classi ; ems only , the required nmn ber of specification si easy to survey  . 
In our example ( ef . Figure 2) , the content words " Fest platte " ( h , ard disk ) and " fl clief crt " ( d clivered ) are linked by a mediating modal verb ( " lvann " ( can ) ) and a passive auxiliary ( % ; erden "( b q . . . . . i , , c)) . The semantic interI ) retation schemat brpassive auxil-im'ies ( 2 ) addresses the conceptype of the instance fbr their syntactic subject  , Cs , o , j = t !/ p e(I . ~ ul , j ) = HARI)-DISK , and that t br their verb part , C , ,e , ,1 , pa ,  . t = type(Iv ~ : , . bv~rt ) = DELIVERY .

For evaluation purposes , we concentrated on the interpretation of genitives  ( as an instance of direct linkage ) and on the interpret a . tion of t ) eriphrastic verbal complexes , i . e . , passive , temporal and modal constructions ( as instances of indirect linkage )  . 
The underlying ontology consists of an upper generic part  ( containing about 1 , 500 concepts and relations ) and domain-specific extensions relating to information technology  ( IT ) and ( parts of ) mmtomi-cal medicine ( MED )  . Each of these two dolna in models adds about 1 , 400 concepts and relations to the upper model . Corresponding lexeme entries in the lexicon provide linkages to the entire ontology  . 
We considered a total of 247 genitives in the smn-ple . Recall was higher for medical texts ( 57% ) than for IT documents ( 31% )  , though , in general , rather low . However , precision peaked at 97% and 94% fo , " medical and IT texts , respectively . Them nnt ) er of syntactic onstructions with modal verbs or auxiliaries amour to  292 exmnples . Compared to genitives , we obtained a slightly more favorable recall for both do in ains  66% tbrMED , 40% for IT-- , while precision dropped slightly to 95% and 85% for nmdical and IT documents , respectively . 4 As with any such evaluation , idiosyncrasies of the ( ; overage of the knowledge bases are inevitably tied with the results and  , thus , put limits on too far-reaching generalizations . However , our data reflect the intention to submit a knowledge-intensive text un  ( lerst mlder to a realistic , i . e . , conceptually unconstrained and therefore " unfriendly " test environment  . Judged from tile figures of our recall data , there is no doubt , whatsoever , that conceptual coverage of the domain constitutes the bottleneck for any knowledge -based approach to NLP  . sSublanguage differences are also mirrored systematically in these data  , since medical texts adhere more closely to well -established concept axonomies and writing standards than magazine articles ill the IT domain  , whose rhetorical styles vary to a larger degree . 
8 Related Work
The standard way of deriving a semantic interpretation for constituency-based grammars is to assign each syntactic rule one or more semantic interpretation rules  ( e . g . , van Eijck and Moore (1992)) , and to 4A more detailed presentation of this evaluation study is given in Romacker and Itahn  ( 20001 ) ) . 
5 For the medical domain at least , we are currently actively pursuing research on the semiautomatic creation of largescale ontologies from weak knowledge sources  , viz . medical terminologies ; cf . Schulz and Hahn (2000) . 
determine the meaning of the syntactic head fl'om its constituents  . This approach as also been adopted in the few explicit attempts at incorporating semantic interpretation i to a dependency grmn in arfi'mne -work  ( Milward , 1992; Lombardo et al ,  1998) . There are no constraints on how to design and orgmfize this ruleset despite those that are imI  ) lied by the choice of the semantic theory . In particular , abstraction mechanisms ( going beyond the level of sortal taxonomies for semantic labels  , cf . , e . g . , Creary and Pollard (1985)) , such as property inheritance , defaults , are lacking . Accordingly , the number of rules increases rapidly and easily reaches orders of severall mndreds in a realworld setting  ( Beanctal .  , 1998) . As an alternative , we provide a small set of gencric semantic interpretation schemata  ( by the order of 10 ) and conceptual interpretation rules ( by the order of 30 for 200 verb concepts ) instead of assigning specific interpretation rules to each grammar item  ( in our case , single lexemes ) , and incorporate inheritance-based abstraction in the use of these schemata during the intert  ) retation process in the knowledge base . We clearly want to point out that while this rule system covers a wide variety of standard syntactic constructions  ( such as gent-tives , prepositional phrases , various tense and modal forms ) , it currently does not account fbr quantificational issues  ( like scope ambiguities ) for which entirely logic-based approach ( Charniak and Goldman , 1988; Moore , 1989; Pereira and Pollack , 1991) provide quite sophisticated solutions . 
Sondheilner et al ( 1984 ) and Itirst ( 1988 ) treat semantic interpretation as a direct mapt ) ing front syntactic to conceptual rel ) resentations . They also shm:e with ustim representation f do in a in knowledge using Kl  , -ONE-style terminological languages , and , hence , theyn m keheavy use of property inheritance ( or typing ) inechanisms . The main difl brence to our approach lies in the status of the semantic rules  . Sondheimer et al ( 1984 ) attach single in-terp retatiot l rules to each r ' olc  ( filler ) and , hence , have to provide utterly detailed specifications reflecting the idiosyncrasies of each semantically relevant  ( role ) attachment . Property inheritmme comes only into play when the selection of alternative semantic rules is constrained to the one  ( s ) inherited from the most specific case frame . In a similar way , Hirst ( 1988 ) uses strong typing at the coue eptual object level only  , while we use it simultaneously at the grmn mar and the domain knowledge level for the processing of semantic schemata  . 
9 Conclusions
We introduced an al ) proach to the design of compact , yet highly expressive senmntic interpretation sdmmata  . They derive their power from two sources . 
First ; , the organization of grammar and domain all iSll IS : al'elmsed on inheritance principles  . Soc-ou (1 , interpretation schematal ) stract from 1 ) articu-lar linguistic phenomena ( spe ( ' ilic lexical items , lexeme classes or dependency relations ) ill terms of general contiguration l ) atterns in ( tepo . nden(-ygral ) hs . 
Underlying these design decisions is a strict separation of linguistic and eouceptual knowledge  . A clearly defined interface is provided which a . llows the sest ) ecitications to nmke reference to line-grained hierarchical knowledge  , noma . tter whether it is of gramnmtical or conceptual origin  . The interface is divided into two levels . O11 on mkesuse of static , high-level ( : on straintsut ) l ) liedl ) y the nlal ) l ) ing of syntactic to conceptual roles or sut/1 ) lied its the meaning of closed word classes . The other uses these constraints in a dynanfic search through a knowledge base  , that is l/arametrized by few and simI ) leschenmta . Finally , at the level of conceptual in-ter protatiou inferences emerging fl'om senmntic rq  ) -resentations are COml ) uted by as (  . ' l ; of t ) roductious which make reference to a verb categorial hierarchy  . 
Also since the numl ) er of s ( : hentata at the semantic description layer remains ratho  . rsulall , their o . x(' . cu-tion is easy to tra ( : e and thus SU l ) l ) or ts the main-tenanco of largo-scale NLP systenls .
