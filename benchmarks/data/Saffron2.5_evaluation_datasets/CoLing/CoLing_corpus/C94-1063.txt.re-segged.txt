A logic formalism is presented which
increases the expressive power of the ID/LP format of GPSG by enlarging the inventory of ordering relations and extending the domain of their application to non-siblings  . This allows a concise , modular and declarative statement of intricate word order regularities  . 
1. INTRODUCTION
Natural languages exhibit significant word order ( WO ) variation and intricate ordering rules . Despite the fact that specific languages show less varmtion and complexity in such rules  ( e . g . those characterized by either fixed , or total l3 , free , WO ) , the vast majority of world languages lie somewhere in between these two extremes  ( e . g . Steele 1981) . Importantly , even the proclaimed examples of rigid WO languages  ( English ) exhibit variation , whereas those with proclaimed total scrambling ( Warlpiri ; cf . llale 198 . 1) show restrictions ( Kashket 1987) . 
Therefore , we need general grammar formalism , capable of processing " flexible " WO(i . e . 
complex WO regularities , including both extremes ) . 
There seem to be a number of requirements that such a formalism should  ( try to ) fulfil ( e . g . 
Pericliev and Grigorov 1992) . Among these stand out the formalism's : ( i ) Expressive power , i . e . capability of ( reasonably ) handling complex WO phenomena , or " flexible " WO . 
( ii ) Linguistic felicity , i . e . capability of stating concisely and declaratively WO roles in a way maximally approximating linguistic parlance in similar situations  . 
( iii ) Modularity , i . e . the separation of constituency rules from the rules pertaining to the linearization of these constituents  ( for there may be many , and diverse , reasons for wanting linearization ( and constituency ) rules easily modifiable , incl . the transparency of WO statements , the imprecision of our current knowledge of ordering rules or the wish to tailor a system to a domain with specific WO  )  . 
( iv ) Reversibility , i . e . the ability of a system to be used for both parsing and generation  ( the reason being that , even if the system is originally intended for a parser  , complex WO rules may be conveniently tested in the generation mode  ; in this sense it is not incidental that e . g . Kay & Kartttmen 1984 have first constructed a generator , and used it as a tool in testing the ( WO ) rules of their grammar , and only then have converted it into a parser ) . 
In this paper , we present a logic-based formalism which attempts to satisfy the above requirements  . A review shows that most previous approaches to WO within the logic grammars paradigm  ( Dahl & Abramson 1990 ) have not been satisfactory . Definite Clause Grammar , DCG , ( Pereira & Warren 1980) , with their CF-style rules , are not modular ( in the sense above ) , so will have to specify explicitly each ordering of constituents in a separate rule  , which results in an intolerably great number of rules in parsing a free WO language  ( e . g . for 5 constituents , which may freely permute , the number of rules is 5!=120) . Other approaches center around the notion of a " gap "  ( or " skip " )  . 
In Gapping Grammar ( GG ) , for instance ( Dahl & Abrams on 1984 , esp . Dahl 1984) , where a rule with a gap may be viewed as a recta -rule  , standing for a set of CF rules , free WO is more economically expressed , however , due the unnatura hmss of expressing permutations by gaps  , GGs generally are clumsy for expressing tlexible WO  , WO is not declaratively and modularly expressed , and GGs cannot be used for generation ( being besides not efficiently implementable )  . Another powerful formalism , Contextual Discontinuous Gr , ' unmar ( Saint-l ) izier 1988) , which overcomes the GGs problems with generative capacity  , is also far from being transparent and declarative in expressing WO  ( e . g . rules with fixed WO arc transformed into free order ones by intruducing special rules  , containing symbols with no linguistic motivation , etc . ) . 
2. PROBLEM SFORTIl EID/LP FOR MAT
In tile immediate Dominance/Linear
Precedence ( ID/LP ) format of GPSG ( Gazdar & Pullum 1981 , Gazdar et al 1985) , where tile ( = immediate dominance ) and linear order , is separated , WO rules are concisely , declaratively and modularly expressed over the domain of local-trees  ( i . e . trees of depth 1) . E . g . the ID rule A "-) ~ DB , C , D , if no linearization restrictions are declared , stands for the mother node expanded into its siblings appearing in any order  ; declaring the restriction D < C e . g . , it stands for the CFG rules  A --> B D C , A-->DBC and A--)D

It is important to note that in GPSG the linear precedence rules stated for a pair of sibling constituents should be valid for the whole set of gramma rules in which these constituents occur  , and not just for some specific rule ( this " global " empirical constraint on WO is called the Exhaustive Constant Partial Ordering  ( ECPO ) property )  . 
However , there are problems with ECPO.
They may be illustrated with a simple example from Bulgarian  . Consider a grammar describing sentences with a reflexive verb and a reflexive particle  ( the NP-subject and the adverb being optional )  , responsible for expressions whose English equivalent is e  . g . "( Ivan ) shaved himself ( yesterday ) " . 
(1) S->mNP , VP ( 2 ) S "-> mVP % omitted subject ( 3 ) VP "> mV\[refl\] , Part\[refl\] , Adv (4) VP->IDV\[refl\] , Part\[refl \]% omitted adverb First , assume we derive a sentence , applying rules (2) and (3) . (5a-b ) are the only accept , able linearizations of the sister constituents in ( 3 )  . 
(5) a .
Brasna ( V\[refl\] ) shaved se ( Part\[refl\] ) vcera ( Adv ) himself yesterday b . 
Vcera(Adv)se(Part\[mill ) brasna(V\[refl\])
Yesterday himselfs have d ( meaning : ( Someone ) shaved himself yesterday ) LP rules however cannot enforce exactly these orderings because the CFG  , corresponding to ( Sa-b ) , viz . 
(6) A-)BCD
A-->DCB is non-ECPO . Thus , fixing any ordering between any two constituents in  ( 3 ) will , of necessity , block at least one of the correct orderings ( 5a-b )  ;   , alternatively , sanctioning no WO restriction will result in overgeneration  , admitting , besides the grammatical ( Sa-b ) , 4 ungrammatical permutations . This inability to impose an arbitrary ordering on siblings we will c  , -dl the ordering-problem of ID/LP grammars . 
No was sume we derive a sentence , applying rules (1) and (4) . The ordering of the siblings , reflexive verb and particle , in ( 4 ) now depends on the order of nodes NP and VP higher up in the tree in rule  ( i ) : if NP precedes VP in ( 1 )  , then the reflexive particle must precede the verb in  ( 4 )  , otherwise it should follow it . 
(7) a .
Ivan(NP)se(Part\[refl\])brasna(V\[refl  l)
Ivan himselfs haved b,
Brasna ( V\[refl\] ) s e ( Part\[refl\] ) Ivan ( NP ) 
Shaved himself Ivan ( meaning : Ivans have d himself ) Again we are introuble since LP rules cannot impose orderings among non-siblings  , their domain of application being just siblings . This we call the domain-problem of ID/LP grammars  , it is essential to note that the domain-problem ay not be remedied  ( even if we are inclined to sacrifice linguistic intuitions  ) by " flattening " the tree , e . g . collapsing rules (1) and (4) into (8) S "> ID NP , V\[refl\] , Part\[refl\]Es caping the second problem , thrusts us into the first : we now cannot properly order the siblings  , the CFG , corresponding to (7a-b ) , being the non-ECPO (6) . 
Sporadic counter-evidence for ECPO grammars has been found for some languages like English  ( the verb-particle construction , Sag 1987 , Pollard and Sag 1987) , German ( complex fronting , Uszkoreit 1985 , EngelkampetaL 1992 ) and Finnish ( the adverb my ( is ' also , too ' Zwicky and Nevis 1986) . Bulgarian offersm , ' kssive counter-evidence ( Pericliev 1992b ) ; one major example , the Bulgarian clitic system , we discuss in Section 4 . 
3. THEFOR MALISM
EFOG ( Extended Flexible word Order
Grammar ) extends the expressive power of the ID/LP format . First , EFOG introduces further WO restrictions in addition to precedence  ( enabling it to avoid the ordering-problem )  , and , second , the formalism extends the domain of application of these WO restrictions  ( in order to handle the domain-problem )  . 

In the immediate dominance part of rules EFOG has two types of constituents : noncontiguous  ( notated :  #Node ) and contiguous ( notated just : Node )  , where Node is some node . Informally , a contiguous node shows that its daughters fern1 a contiguous sequence , whereas a noncontiguous one allows its daughters to be interspersed among the sisters of this noncontiguous node  . 
E . g . in EFOG notation ( using a double arrow for ID rules , small case letters for constants and uppercase ones for variables  )  , the grammar of timLat in sentence : Puellabona puerum parvumamat  ( good girl loves small boy )  , grammatical in all its 120 permutations and , besides , having discontinuity in the noun phrases , we capture with the following structured EFOG rules with no we restrictions : s = => #np  ( nom )   ,  #vp . 
np(Case ) = :> adj(Case ), noun(Case).
vp :=> verbi#np(acc).
accompanied by the dictionary rules : verb ==>\[ amat \]  . 
adj(nom ) : :>\[ bona\].
adj(acc ) :=>\[ parvum\].
noun(nom ) ==>\[ puella\].
noun(ace ) :=>\[ puerum\].
The noncontiguous nodes allow us to impose an ordering  ( or to intersperse , as in the above case ) MI their daughter nodes without having to sacrifice the natural constituencies  . It will be clear that this extension of the domain of LP rules  ( which can go any depth we like )  , besides ordering between on-siblings , allows an elegant treatment of discontinuities . 
In order to solve the ordering-problem , we Imve introduced additional we constraints . The following atomic we constraints have been defined : 
Precedence constraints : ? precedes ( e . g . a < b ) ? immediately precedes ( a << b )   ( we also maintain the notation , > and > > , for ( immediately ) follows ; see comment a W below )
Adjacency constraints : ? is adjacent ( a <> b)
Position conxtraints : ? is positioned first/last ( e . g . first(a , Node ), where Node is a node ; e . g . first(a , s ) designates that a is sentence-initial . 
We also allow atomic we constraints to combine into complex logical expressions  , using the following operators with obvious semantics : ? Conjunction  ( notated : and . ) ? Disjunction ( or ) ? Negation ( not ) ? Implication ( if , e . g . (b >> a ) if ( a < c )) ? Equivalence ( iff , e . g .   ( b >> a ) iff ( a < c )   ) ? If then else ( if then e1se ) Our we restriction language is , of course , partly logically redundant ( e . g . immediately precedence may be expressed through precedence and adjacency  , and so is tim case with the last two of the operators  , etc . ) . 
l to wever , what is logically is not necessarily psychologically equiwdent  , and our goalt in s been to maintain a linguist -friendly notation  ( el . 
requirement ( ii ) of Section 1) . To take just one example , we have ' after ' in addition to ' before ' , since linguists normally speak of precedence of dependent with respect ohead word  , not vice versa , and hence will use both expressions in respective situations  ( surely it is not by chance that NLs also have both words  )  . 
As a simple example of the ordering possibilities of EFOG  , consider the we Universal 20 ( of Greenberg and Hawkins ) to the effect that NPs comprising dem ( on strative )  , num(eral ) , adj ( ective ) and noun can appear in that order , or in its mirror-image . We can write a " universal " rule enforcing adjacent permutations of all constituents a follows : np ==> dem  , num , adj , noun . 
ip:dem<>num and num <> adj and adj <> noun.
4. BULGARIANCLITICS
Bulgarian clitics fall into different categories :   ( 1 ) nominals ( short accusative pronouns : me " me " , te " you " , etc . ; short dative prononns : mi " tome " , ti " to you " , etc . ) ;   ( 2 ) verbs ( the present tense forms of " to be " sam " am " , si " ( you ) are " , etc . ) ;   ( 3 ) adjectives ( short possessive pronouns : mi " my " , ti " your " , etc . ; short ml\]exive pronoun : si " one's own ") ; and (4) particles ( inten ; ogative li " do " , reflexives e " myself/yourself . .", the negative ne " no(t )", etc . ) . They have the distribution of the specific categories they belong to  , but show diverse , and quite complex orderings , varying in accordance with the positions of their siblings/non-siblings as well as the position of other clitics appearing in the sentence  . ' In effect , dmir ordering as a rule i This often results in discontinuities  ( o1" non-projectivities )  . For an automated way of discovering and a description of such constructs format  . 
By way of illustration , below we present he EFOG version ( simplified for expository reasons ) of the grammar ( 14 ) from Section 2 to get the flavour of how we handle the problems mentioned there  . The ID rules are as follows ( note that the noncontiguous node  #vp allows its daughters v  ( refl )  , part ( refl ) ,   , ' rod adv to be ordered with respect on p ) :  ( 1' ) s ==> np , #v-p . 
(2') s ==> vp.
% omitted subject (3') v-p ==> v(refl ), adv.
(4') v p ==> v(refl) , % omitted adverb part ( refl ) , part ( refl ) . 
np::>\[ivan\].
v(refl ) = :>\[ brasna\].
part(refl ): :>\[ se\].
adv::>\[vcera\].
The WO of v(refl ) and part(refl ) is as follows . First , the reflexive particle never occurs sentence -initially  ( information we cannot express in ID/LP )  ; in EFOG we express this as : ip : not ( first ( part ( refl )   , s )) . 
Secondly , we use the default rule ' if then else ' to declare the regularity that the particle in question immediately precedes the verb  , unless when the verb occurs sentence qnitially , in which case the particle immediately follows it  ( which is of course also in expressible in ID/LP ) : ip : if the nelse ( first ( v ( refl )   , s ) , v(refl ) < < part(refl) , part(refl ) << v(refl )) . 
These two straightforward LP rules thus are , all we need to get exactly the linearizations we want : those of  ( Sa-b ) and ( 7a-b )  , as well as , all and the only other correct expressions derivable from the ID grammar  . These LP rules are also interesting in that they express the overall behaviour of a number of other proclitically behaving clitics  ( as e . g . those with nominal , ' rod verbal nature ; see above ) . 
Because of space limitations we cannot enter into further details here  . Suffice it to say that EFOG was tested successfully in the description of this veo ' complicate domain  2 as well as in some other hard ordering problems in Bulgari  , 'm . 
6. CONCLUSION
Logic grammars have generally failed to handle flexible WO in a satisfactory way  . We have described a formalism which allows the grammar-writer to express complex WO rules in a language  ( including discontinuity ) in a concise , modular and natural way . EFOG extends the expressive power of the ID/LP format in both allowing complex LP rules and extending their domain of application  . 
EFOG is based on a previous version of the formalism  , called FOG ( Pericliev and Grigorov 1992) , also seeking to overcome the difficulties with the ID/LP format  . FOG however looked for different solutions to the problems  ( e . g . using LP rules attached to each specific ID rule , rather than global ones , which unnecessarily proliferated the LP part of the grammar  ; or employing flattening rather than having noncontiguous grammar symbols to the same effect  )  . 
EFOG is also related to FO-TAG ( Becker et al 1991 ) and the HPSG approach ( Engelkamp et al .  1992 , Oliva 1992 ) in extending the domain of applicability of LP rules  . A compariss on with these form ~ disms is beyond the scope of this study  ; we may only mention here that our inventory of LP relations is larger  , and unlike e . g . the latter approach we do not confine to binary branching trees  .
