AUG .  2328 ,   1992   1 Introduction The major goal of the system described here is to provide a naturalen virc ~' ~ nent I for learning to produce sentences in French  . In order to achieve this goal , we have integrated the student into the process . He should be active rather than reactive , that is , he should talk not only when being asked . After all , he knows what he wants to say , what he lacks are the means of translating his thoughts into language  . 
SWIM 2 is an exploratory environment which has been built to simulate natura learning  . The student asks the questions and the system answers them  . Any of the following questions could occur in a natural setting :  3   1  ) How does one say ? c ~ a . 9 2 ) Can one say linguistic fo~m ? 3 ) How should one say idea . 9 4 ) Why does one say fen'n-1 and not form-2?5 ) What would happen if conceptual rectification  ?   6  ) What would happen if syntactic modification ? 7  ) What would happen if wordy instead of word x ? 8 ) What is the difference between form x and foz a xay ? leaning-Represent a fio:ttp ~ llia ~ U htl decitmt lv?t ttIx gargon  .

Figure 1   1 A computerized learning environment is said to be natural if the transfer of knowledge is achieved essentially in rite same way as could be the case between two human agents  , where a learner ( child . student ) asks questions and the teacher ( native speaker , parent/teacher ) answers them . 
2 SWIM is the acronym of See What I Mean ? It has been conceived by Michael Zock and implemented by A  . Larouiona Macintosh . 
3 For the time being only the first and last four types of questions are implemented for a small subset of French  ( simple sentences )  . 
The first communication-mode ( how does one say < idea > ? ) raises an interesting problem : how to tell the computer what one wants to say  ( message )  . The fundamental question here is in what terms to codethought and access it  . Obviously , there are several ways . 
One could ask in another natural language ( translation )  , one could use images , or one could use some form of metalanguage . 
In this paper we discussome of the problems that arise by using a metalauguage  . We then show how a special category of thought , tense , can be communicated by nsing a hybrid form of representation  . But , before doing so let us give a short description of the system  . For more details see\[29, 30, 31\] . 
2 Description of the system
The dialogue is initiated by specifying the communication mode  . Let us suppose that the user had started with the first question : How does one say < idea > ? In that case the system presents a menu  ( type hierarchy ) from which the user has to choose : Speech act : statement  , question , command Actions-processes : taxonomy of verbs tense : present  , past , future , etc . 
Discourse objects : taxonomy of nouns number : singular  , plural communic , status : definite , indefinite , 
Attributes : taxonomy of attributes
By choosing specific values from a set of alternatives  , the user tells the system what he wants to say . 4 As the dialogue develops , the system builds the underlying meaning in the form of a semantic network  . It then invites the user to try to express this meaning  , after which it outputs its own form . 
As one cat * see from Figure 1 , the screen is divided into five parts . The large window at the top represents he underlying meaning of the message a student is trying to convey  . 
The next two windows contain respectively the user 's attempt to express this meaning and the system 's version  . Possible mismatches between these two versions are highlighted on the screen  . This allows the system to draw the student's attention to errors  . Actually , by looking at Figure 1 you can see that the student made a mistake in the verb agreement "  regard6"  . Finally , the two windows at the bottom represent , from left to right , a snapshot of the system's r corozy of meaning and the user's mexmry offest a  . 
The former is a device to display , hence to recall the underlying conceptual representation of a specific sentence chosen from thert ~ m ~ ryoffer n window  , whereas the latter is an incrementally built database  ( trace ) of all the sentences encountered so far . 
The idea behind this separation is to allow the user to make a contrastive analysis of meaning and form between  4 For more details concerning the interface controlling the conceptual input  ( What to say-component )  , see Zoek (1991) .

By comparing the surface for ut and the underlying meaning of two sentences  , file user can appreciate he relationship between meauin gaud rural  . The critical feature , digone that is respousible for the difference of form  , is highlighted by the system . In our exant pleit is the value " singular " . 
Past this point , the user has various options : eithelhe continues in the basic communication m < r de  ( How doe ~ one nay < idea > ? )  , or he changes the kind of question he wants to ask  . Let us suppose that he wants to build a completely different senlence  . In this case he . could either go through the whole routine , which i , ~ quite cumber some , or he could perfom the conceptual changes direetely on the graph  . Obviously , this latter metl to dismuch faster . 6 Actually , everything you see on the graph , except deep-case relations , is considered by the system as a vaiiable whose value may be change directely by the user  . ht order to do so , he clicks on any of the show u attributes ( verb , tense , mode , etc . ) and chooses a new value . For example , if he clicks on the verb " regarder '" ( to watch ) the system answers by displaying a list of cm tdidates from which we must choose  . . By clicking on the feature " present " , rite system shows different values ( present , past , future , etc . ) of the variable " tense ", etc . Everytiute the system is given some piece of information it will change the meaning representation accordingly and  , ilasked , output rite corresponding form . For example , if one started from sentence ( a tasking the system to chm~gc the number of the direct object l ? om " singular " to " plural " it would produce  ( b )  . If one asked to change the tense from " simple past " to " present perfect "  , it would produce ( e ) , etc .

Actually , the dialogue described corresponds to the commuttication mode  5  . If one changes only one value each time , asking the system to tell right a way how this meaning change is reflected in form  , one can very quickly build attd explore a large search space  . It should be noted , that this kind of dialogue between man and machine is much faster at td  5 See communication mode 8 : What is the difference between < form x > and < form y > ?  6 Actually , that is one of the major advantages of abstract representations compared to  , let us say , icons . Another advantage is that this kind of represent a timt shows online how conceptual or pragmatic choices affecthe intermediate structure  , hence more or less directly tile final form . In consequence , by displaying online the way how the intermediate structure changes after each choice  , we have a means of moving from a black box to a glass box  . The former only shows how changes of the input ' ( conceptual choices ) are reflected in the output , whereas the latter also shows how discourse choices  ( topicalisation , word choice , etc . ) affect he intermediate lvels .

3 Discussion
We have described a computerized learning euviromnent that has severaliuterestittg features :  ( at it allows a potential user to learn French on his own  .   ( b ) it fosters learning through explor at km ( hypothesis-testing , inductive learning ) ;   ( c ) it allows the user to ask questions rather I\]lan simply answer them  . A she knows best what his needs are , he is untst likely to ask the right questions at the rigid moment  ; On the other hand , the system has also various shortcomings : ( at the linguistic coverage is extremely small : only very simple structures c~t n be used  ;   ( b ) the conceptual interface is a surface-rather than a deep-structure compouent  ( it already contains the lexieal items , i . e . , the progrant hinks ill terms of the target language  )  ;   ( c ) the size of the discourse universe : one canduly talk about a very limited range of facts  ;   ( d ) the rigidity of the conceptual coutpone ut : he order in which lheme aning is conveyed is defined a priori  . The choice of verbs always precedes the choice of the uouns  ;   ( e ) the terminology used ( metalanguage ) may be ilmccessible to the linguistically innocent user  . 
In the remainder of this paper we will only be e on centeal with the last point  . More precisely , we will focus on the problem ol conveying the notious of time  , tense at td aspect . For a proposal of how to increase the power and flexibility of the conceptual compoue at see  \[33  ,  34\] . 
4 . Sentence generation and tense specification While much atteutiou has been devoted to rite problem of representing and interpreting tense  \[2  ,  13 , 13 a , 13 b \] , little , if any atteution has been devoted to the problem of generating tense ill the context of natural anguage general imt  . A notablexception is the work of V . Ehrich \[6\] who describes the properties of a situation ( a convenient neutral term for making indiscriminately reference to eveals  , actious , processes , tates ) in terms of category , aspoct , relation , and position . 
Sentence geaeration consists of translating a conceptual swucture into a surface form  . Obviously , information concerning time , tense aud aspect is part of the ACrE . SDECOLING-92 , NANTES , 2328 ao ( rr 1992477 Picot . ol:COI . ING-92, NANTES , AUG . 2328,1992 conceptual input . The problem is in what terms a naive user could communicate these abstract notions  . 
4 . 1 The problem of choosing the right form Tense can be communicated by choosing among a set of metulinguistic terms  ( past , present , future , etc . ) . These terms are actually used in schools , in textbooks and even in intelligentutoring systems  \[7  ,  8\] . Yet this approach as several shortcomings : ( A ) Students are not linguists . While notions such as " past , present , future " seem to be meaningful when we deal with simple tenses  , things changerapidly as soon as we move to more complex tenses like present continuous  , past perfect , etc . The student is certainly short of intuition when he comes across tenses for which there is no equivalent in his mother tongue  . 
( B ) There is no one-to-one correspondance btween grammatical tenses and semantic values  . The " present forms " are quite often used in order to convey the meaning of the past  , the present , or the future (14) . In a similar vein , past forms can be used with a present value ( 3 )  1 ) J ' arrivefil ' instant . (I have just arrived . ) pl ~, 2) Jer ~ fl ~ chis . ( I'm thinking . ) pI'g ~, , 3) J ' arrived unsun instant . ( I'm coming right now . )4) J ' arrive . ( l just arrived . ) PKST , -( Iant coming . )eXYlx ~: 5 ) Jevena is vous demander une augmemntion ( I just wanted to ask for as a lary increase ) Pr  ~ . qEh ~; ,   ( C ) The possibility of using a certain form depends on the context of the sentence  ( presence of a temporal adverbial , nature of the subject and complements ) .  7
Consider the following examples : 6 ) Jesuis content ( I am very glad . ); 7) * J'dta is content(I was glad . );8)* J'ai~t~content . (I have been glad . ); 9) Hier , j ' ~ tais content . ( Yesterday , I was very glad . ); lO)*Hier,j'ai$t$content . ( Yesterday , I have been glad . ); ll ) Hier , j ' ai~t ~ content d ' apprend reton retour ( Yesterday , Iwa . vglad to learn that you were coming back ) . 
While (6) is quite acceptable , its translations into past--beit the simple past  ( 7 )  , or past perfect (8) , -- need an explicit reference . Moreover , the form of the past perfect in French can only be used if one refers to an event  , -- theing ression of a state , -- as in (11) . 
5. How to visualize tense ?
I cons provide a very natural way of representing tense  . 
Several grammars for English \[21\] and for French \[10\] make use of them . We draw on these sources and adapt them for SWIM . In order to do so we provide the user with a basic set of elements for translating tense into icons :  ( a ) a time axis ;   ( b ) a representation of the point of speech ( NOW ) on the time axis ;   ( c ) a set of types of 7 When using a specific tense one should also be sensitive to the kind of inferences the addressee might draw  . For instance , the following two sentences have completely different implications  . : ( a)I've been thinking about you . (b ) I thought about you . While ( a ) suggests that one cares for the person one is talking to  , (b ) implies that one doesn't care any more .   ( We owe this example to Nicolay Vazov from the university of Sofia  ) situations ( state , event , etc . ) ; ( d ) a frame of reference ( a window ) ; and/or ( e ) a point of reference . 
The time axis represents he intuitive notion of time as an oriented linear structure  . The time of vertical arclocates the time of utterance : on the lefthand side is the past  , on the right the future . The situation to be referred to can be communicated by choosing an icon from a set of alternatives  ( ee figure 7 )  . The last two components , the frame and the point of reference represent the way  ( point of view ) the speaker looks at the situation . 
We start by describing these basic elements and illustrate their use through examples  . We then explain how these elements are related to form a coherent metulinguistic vocabulary  . 
5.1 The basic elements
The minimal machinery necessary for generating tense is composed of a time axis with a point of speech  ( now ) and a means of locating an action/event with respect to this point of speech  ( Figure 5 )  . 
point of speech ootime axis O
Figure 5
Reichenbach used the following concepts to characterize tense : a point of speech  ( S )  , a point of reference ( R ) and a point of event ( E )  .   8 Furthermore he used two kinds of connectors in order to express the fact that two events coincide with one another C  , ") , or that an event preceded another C_") . The following formula shall illustrate his classification  .

( A ) Types of situation and corresponding icons : A sentence refers to some point in time  ( temporal situation )  . A situation will be represented by any of the following icons  8 Voint of speech refers to the very moment in which the utterance takes place  ( now )  . The point of reference is the perspective from which the event is considered  . The r~int of event is the very moment at which the even took place  ( yesterday )  .

Figure 7 : Types of situation and corresponding i consAs tate is considered as covering a stretch of time with no definite boundaries  . The icon reperesenting this suggests this open -endedness by having fuzzy delimiting zones  . Both ongoing processes and activities have a well-defined starting point but no determined point of termination  . Note however , that activities can be interrupted at any time and be reported as events  . Let us suppose that " Paul was swimming " , and then stopped . 
This can be reported by ~ Paulswam, . Telie processes do not have this property , because they have some natural point of completion  . If < < Paul was swimming across the Channel ~ , and then stopped swimming , we could describe this situation as Paul has been swimming  , but we could not say ~ Pauls wama cross the Channel  . ~> In that case , the point of completion can be referred to , even if it is neve reached : ~ Paul was swimming across the channel  , but he never made it > > . The situation can also be considered as indeteffninate :  , Paul was swimming across the Channel when I last heard about him > ~  . 
An event has both a starting point and a point of termination  . It can be punctual or not . According to Reichenbach it is represented as a point or au interval  , whereas we allow for the additional use of a frame  . An event can also be considered with regards to the result of its occurrence  . There are events with a resulting state . In the corresponding icon , we represent this state as adjacent to the event which has brought it about  . Usually , the precise nature of this resulting state needs to be inferred  ( cf . \[10\]): It has been raining ; in consequence the pavement is wet , it got comer , there are puddles in the street , my hair dress is spoiled , etc . 
It a bitual events are an undetermined umber of events  . 
The icon on of habitual events is meant to suggest heir resemblance to states  . It should " also be noted that the number of events may be concept nally indefinite  . 
Compare : ( a ) l played tennis many times last year . ( b )   1 used to play tennis when I was a young man In gust case we are dealing with a sequence of individual events  , not with a habitual event . Hence it is quite possible to continue the dialogue by asking the following question " how many times did you play ?"  , while this question . seems quite odd in the second case . 
( B ) Frame of reference , point of reference : Optional elements are a frame of reference and a point of reference  , both of which can be manipulated by the user . The former consists of a window which represents heperiod of time considered by the speaker  . It is usually associated with a temporal adverbial  ( Yesterday Paul visited the Eiffel Tower )  . The point of reference can be used in order to represent some instant which plays the role of a translated point of speech  ( ht 1980 Paul had already visited Paristwice . ) . 
5 . 2 Using these e lements tn produce a t ime scenar io The procedure is as follows:  ( a ) Choose a suitable type of situation ( icon ) to represent the temporal structure of the situation  ;   ( b ) Position theic on relative to the point of speech  ; (c ) If necessary , introduce and position a frame and/or point of relerence and position it  . ( d ) In the overall representation , some part of the situation should be adjacent o , or included in an element of reference ( point of speech , point of reference , frame of reference ) . 
If not , reexamine step ( c).
Suppose we have an untensed representation f : ~ Paulai melacuisine it alienne  , ( Paullikes Italian cooking ) . In order to generate the tense , we choose a state and the position of the point of speech on the time axis  ( Figure 8a )  . From this representation the corresponding time ( present tense ) can be generated .

Figure 8
Figure 8b conveys the same mes~geas 8a in the past . 
Since no direct reference to the point of speech is available  , a frame of reference is necessary . Here it plays the same role as the point of speech in figure  8a   . If the user adds the adverbial ~< l ' an pass 6 , ~( last year ) as a marker of reference , we get ~< l ' an pass 6 , Paulai maitla cuisine ACTESDECOLlNG-92 , NANTES . 2328 ho~r1992479 PROC . OFCOLING-92, NANTES , AUG .  2328 , 1992 it alienne ~ , ( Last year Paulliked italian cooking . ) The interpretation of maimer la cuisine italienne  , (to like italian cooking ) in terms of a state should be distinguished from its interpretation as an event  . The latter would be the instantaneous change from one state to another  . That's why we need further specifications : ~ Qu and Paularen contrd Gina  , ilaaimgla cuisine it alienne . ~( When Paulmet Gina , he began to like Italian cooking ) . Figures 8c and 8d show two possible representations of similar , yet different situations . The completion of the work is not precisely determined in this case  . 
Among the difficulties faced by a learner of French is the dual value of "  pass6   compos6"  . Consider , ( tlier ) , j ' aid critmon article-\[ ( yesterday ) 1 wrote my paper \] In one interpretation ( figure 9a )  , the writing of the paper is considered as a past event  . Locating the action within a reference frame requires the use of an adverbial like ~ hier > >  ( yesterday )  .

Figure 9
This case is to be differentiated from the situation depicted in Figure  9b   . Here the implicit reference is now . 
The past event is considered with respect othe state resulting from it  ( present relevance )  . In fact , the same tense is used in this ease in French , whereas < < Yesterdayl wrote my paper ~ would be used in English in case  ( 9a )  , and e . l have written my paper ~ in case (9b ) . 
Another typical case of ambiguity is the use of the " present tense " in French  . The Figures 9c and 9d , while different in English , yield the same form in French . The first one ( 9e ) signals habitual or repetitive use of the present ense  , corresponding to < ~ I playtennis ~ . The second situation corresponds to "1 amplaying tennis " , implying an ongoing activity at the time of speech  . 
Please note that the first situation does not imply any actual activity at the time of speech  , but only a general validity of a kind of property  . As the i consuggests , it looks very much like a state . 
6 . The underlying temporal ontology and its use for generation  6  . 1 . Types of situation and corresponding icons Our classification of types of situation  ( cf . also\[2\] ) is based on conceiving the temporal structure of a situation as a result of  ( a ) the lexical meaning , the tense and the aspect of a given verb , ( b ) the nature of the subject , the complements and the time adverb ' rals . 
Lexical meaning : We basically subscribe to Vendler's typology  \[26\] who classifies situations in terms of states , activities , accomplishments and achievements . 
Nakhimovsky , in a more recent classification \[17\] , introduces additional features ( generic vs . specific resources for atclic processes ) to Vendler's punctuality , stativity , and telieity . Our classification is based on four classes of lexical meanings  , corresponding to combinations of the features : punctuality  , stativity , telicity . 
? punctual events ( punctual , nonstative , atelic ); ? states ( nonpunctual , stative , atelic ); ? telic processes . 
? atelic activities;
Aspect is related to the perspective from which a given situation is viewed  . Following Comrie\[4\] , we distinguish between perfect , perfective and imperfeetive aspect . In French , the impar fait ( continuous paso is a typical imperfective form : a situation is considered from the inside  . Perfective , on the other hand , considers a situation as a whole . Perfect is related to the consideration fa given event together with a new state which is a consequence of this event happening  , for example , I have prepared some coffee . 
In our system , perfect is represented by an event with a resulting state  . Aspect plays a dual role : it determines the type of situation and it allows for choosing a specific frame of reference  . 
Lexical meaning combined with the aspect of the verb  , the types of the subjects and complements , and the temporal adverbials yield the type of situation  . For example , the verb dcrire ( to write ) has an intrinsic lexical meaning : a telic activity  . However , it can change : Pauld crivit unroman ( John wrote a novel ) : telic process ; Pauld critdesromans ( John writes novels ) : atelic activity ; Pauldcrivaitan roman ( John was writing a book ) : ongoing process . 
6.2. How to choose the right tense . 9
The following table shows how tense could be computed on the basis of an iconic representation fasituation  . 
The system determines the position of the main part of the situation relative to the point of speech  ( PS )  . The qualification is necessary only in the case of an event with a resulting state  , where the event is the main part of the situation . 
If the main part of the situation is posterior to the point of speech  , a future tense is chosen by default , though presentense remains a possible candidate . Using either or amounts to communicating a special modal nuance  .

The first case represents an ongoing processor activity  , with an event occuring somewhere in the middle of it  , while the second is a sequence of two adjacent events  . So far we handle the case If the main situation is prior to the time of speech  , the conclusion depends on the presence of a point of reference  ( PR ) prior to the time of speech .

Figure 10 specified , and if the type of situation is an event , one can use the past perfect . In the case of an event or a punctual event , the past perfect is a stylistic alternative ( polished style )  . 
Temporal adverbials are classified as ( a ) time-position adverbs ( last night , on Monday ) ; ( b ) as span and duration adverbs ( for a month , up to 1979) ; or ( c ) as frequency adverbs ( usually , often ) . Temporal adverbs constraintense generation . Durational adverbs may enforce a habitual meaning on verbs having an intrinsic punctual meaning : < < He has been diving for several months now  . ~ , Temporal subordinate clauses : In the case of simple sentences  , the task of determining the tense from an icon is straightforward  . More subtle strategies are needed in sentences with temporal subordinate clauses  9  . Suppose the main clause concerns < < students working > ~  ( PAST )  , whereas the subordinate clause is < < the head master entering the class room ~  ( PAST )  . Let the temporal conjunction bequand ( when ) . Then we have two possibilities : 9 We leave a side the problem of generating subordinate clauses in the subjunctive mood  ; many temporal conjunctions ( e . g . avant que : before ) require the use of the subjunctive mood . 
of quand ( when ) , using icons and strategies similar to the ones described by Moons & Steedman  \[16\]  . 
The way in which temporal subordinate clauses reflect on the types and order of the situations has been examined in the literature  ( \[24 ,  15 ,  16\]) . 
7 Conclusion
We have presented in this paper a method of visualizing time  , tense and aspect . By using icons we have provided the user with an interface that allows him to translate abstract hought into concrete thought  . The advantage being that his thoughts are expressed in terms of concrete actions rather than in terms of a  ( mere ) language , which is often too abstract to be meaningful to then adve user  .
