1. Introduction
An automatic telephone interpreting system will undoubtedly be used to overcome communication barriers between people speaking different languages  . Recently , great interest has been growing in this area\[ Saitoh-88\]  , \[ Waibel-91l , \[Kitano-91\] , \[ Roe-92\] . SL-TRANS 2 . 1 ~ is an experimental system developed at ATR , which translates Japanese speech to English speech  . It is composed of three basic components : peech recognition  , translation and speech synthesis . This paper introduces the system with emphasis on the translation component  . The discourse domain is a dialogue concerning an international conference registration  . The distinctive features of the system are as follows  . 
(1 ) Japanese continuou speech input can be recognized with high accuracy  . Moreover , speaker independent recognition using speaker adaptation technique has been developed  . 
(2 ) Various expression speculiar to spoken language can be accepted and translated properly into the target language  . In Japanese , the style of spoken sentences is generally quite different from that of written texts  . Spoken utterances are fragmentary and include the speaker's intention directly or indirectly  . The system extracts the intention and then transcribes it to a proper expression i the target language  . 
(3 ) Linguistic knowledge sources necessary for the translation are defined declaratively to the extent  . Such definition improves high modularity , readability and easy maintenance of knowledge description  . 
In the next section , the system is overviewed and a brief description of the speech recognition  *1  ) SL-TRANS2 is the extended version of SL-
TRANS\[Morimoto-90\] mechanism is given . In the following three sections , distinctive technical features of each component of the translation system are described  . Experiment results are shown in section 6 .

Fig .   1   SL-TRANS2 speech recognizer can accept any speaker's speech  . Phone level Hidden Marker Models ( HMM ) and syntactic rules for Japanese are defined in the recognizer\[  Kita-90\]  . By referring to these rules , the recognizer predicts the next possible phones and verifies their existence by matching them with corresponding HMMs  . The process is invoked for many hypotheses in parallel until the end of the utterance is reached  . 
Finally , the nbest sential hypotheses are output , with their respective recognition scores . 
The output hypotheses are tagged with word information such as a part-of-speech label  , then AcI~DECOLING-92 , NANTES . 2328 AOC'rI 9921048 PROC . OFCOLING-92, NArcrEs , AUG .  2328 ,   1992 the speech recognizer works as a kind of morphological nalyzer for the following analysis component  . These hypotheses are all wellformed syntactically  , hut not always semantically , pragmatically or contextually . 
The next analysis component checks the validity of each hypothesis and selects the most plausible  one*2  )  . After analysis , some zero anaphora ( noun phrase ellipses ) are supplemented using pragmatics such as honorific expressions in Japanese  . Then , the semantics of the sentence is output in the form of a feature structure  . This feature structure is generally composed of two parts : an intentional content and a propositional content  . The former indicates the speaker's intention and is expressed in terms of language-independent conccpts  . The latter is expressed in terms of language -dependent concepts  . The subsequent transfer system transfers only the propositional content otheir target language concepts  . During Um generation process , tim two components are merged and af'mal surface x pression i the target language is generated  . Finally , synthesized English speech is output from the synthesizer  . Currently , a commercial English language speech synthesizer is used in the system  . 
3. Analysis 3.1 Grammar Formalization
The grammar formal is nladopted was originally based on HPSG  ( and its Japanese version JPSG ) \[ Kogure-90\] . In each lexical entry , syntactic on straints , emantic on straints and even pragmatic on straints are defined as a feature structure  ( Fig . 2) . 
Parsing is basically accomplished using a unification operation between lexical items or successively derived constituents  . This is effective in parsing Japanese spoken sentences which have a variety of expressions  . According to the JPSG theory , a few principles ( the head feature principle , the subeategorization feature principle , etc . ) and one grammar rule ( a mother is composed of a daughter and a head ) are * 2 ) The contextual evaluation function is not yet implemented in the current system  ( deflex-named ~-1 ~ vstern ( < ! rnsynheadgrfs >==\[ subj ? ( subj\[\[sysn\[\[head\[\[pos N\]\[form i9~'\]\]\]\] \[sem?subj-sem\]\] ) \]\[ ohj ?

l to wever , naive implementation f the theory as a practical system brings an explosion of processing time and memory consumption  , even for a simple sentence . To solve this problem , medium grained contextfree grammar ( CFG ) rules are introduced \[ Nagata-92\] . The grammar rules are constructed to maintain declarative description of lexieal constraints and also to suppress unnecessary unification execution  . For instance , the concatenation conditions between Japanese verbs and auxiliaries are defined explicitly by the rules  . 
3, 2 Parsing Algorithm
Parsing is guided by CFG rules and accomplished by the unification operation as described above  . Generally , most of the processing time in a unification -based parsing method is consumed for the unification operation  . 
In this system , besides dividing CFG rules as mentioned above , other efficiency improving technologies have been introduced  . For instance , unification execution is delayed until all CFG rules have been applied  . Another approach is to improve the unification procedure itself  . In our system , an efficient unification mechanism using several techniques such as the quasi-destructive graph unification algorithm \ [  Tomabechi-91\] has been implemented . Using these improvements , tiffs system can analyze an input utterance in a fairly shortime  . 
3.3 Zero Anaphora Resolution
ACRESDE COLING-92 , NANTES , 2328 hotter 1992i049 Paoc . OFCOLING-92 . NANTES , AUO .  2328, 1992
Some zero anaphora are resolved and supplemented using pragmatic information in Japanese\[  Dohsaka-90l   . In general , pronouns indicating the participants such as " I " or " You " are seldom explicit in spoken Japanese  . On the other hand , Japanese is abundant in honorific expressions , and such information can be used to interpret some zero pronouns  . For instance , in the following example , the agent of the predicate " okuru " ( send ) in the last phrase can be inferred to be the speaker because he  ( she ) is stating a promise and expressing it politely . Then , the indirect object of " okuru " is decided as the hearer  , if the dialogue only concerns two participants . 
tourokuyoushi-wo ( a registration form-ACC j 4 ) ookuri-itashimasu ( send-Polite ~ Promise ) Other zero anaphora , especially a subject , in a sentence without such information is interpreted as the speaker  . 
4. Transfer
Input to the transfer process is a feature structure indicating the semantics of an utterance  . The feature structure is represented recursively using relationships  . A relationship consists of a relationship name and its case roles  . 
A relationship name is essentially a concept . In the analysis system , the surface illocutionary force type for the utterance is calculated from the surface expression  . This is converted to an appropriate illocutionary force type by analyzing and taking into consideration the speaker's plan in that situation  . In the current system , however , this conversion is done straight from the surface illocutionary force type because a contextual processing mechanism has not yet been integrated into the system  . Typical illocutionary force types established for goal-oriented dialogues  , uchas those in the target domain , are shown in Table 1 . 
The transfer system transfers only the feature structure of the propositional content using a feature structure rewriting system\[  Hasegawa-90\]  . The rewriting system traverses an input feature structure and rewrites it according to a set of rewriting rules  . There are Table 1 Examples of lllocutionary Force Type

A rule is defined declaratively and composed of three sub-specifications as in Fig  . 4: an environment condition , an input condition and an output specification .

Fig , 3 Transfer Rule to control the application of rules instead of encoding explicit relationships between rules  ; when some condition is given , only the rules satisfying it are applied . It could also be used to transfer the input properly based on a given context  . 
Another important problem in the transfer process i how to disambiguate polysemous words and how to choose a proper target concept  . In this system , a thesaurus of concepts is defined and used for this purpose  . This thesaurus is ACRESDECOTING-92 , NANTES , 2328 AOt ~ T199210 S0PREC . OFCOLING-92, NANTES , AUO .  2328 ,   1992 implemented as a type system and referred to by related rules  . 
5. Generation
The basic method used in the generation system is also a unification algorithm  . However , unlike the analysis system , each linguistic generation rule is defined for a comparatively large unit  . This is because the variety of sentences to be generated is not as great as that in analysis  , e . g . an idiomatic expression can be used in certain cases  . A generation rule is defined as a phrase definition \ [  Kikui-92\]  . A phrase definition is basically composed of three sub-specifications as shown in Fig  . 4: a syntactic phrase structure , syntactic constraints and semantics , and an application environment . 
structure ( STOP ( SAUX ( NP PRON ) VP ) SIGN ) annotation ( STOP\[\[syn\[\[e-catSTOP\]\]\]\[sem\[ reinREQUEST\]\[agen?agen*SP*\]\[recp* HR*\]\[obje?action\]\]\]\]  )   ( S\[\[syn\[\[e-catS\]\[e-inv+\]\[e-slash  -\]\]\]\]  )   ( AUX\[\[syn\[\[e-cat AUX\]\[e-lex " would "\ ]\]\]\]  )   ( NP\[\[syn\[\[e-cat NP\]\]\]I )   ( PRON\[\[syn\[\[e-catPRON\]\[e-lex " you' \]\]\]\[sem*SP*\]\]  )   ( VP\[\[syn\[\[e-cat VP\]\[e-vformBSE\]\[ e-subj\[\[sem?agen\]\]\]\]\]\[sem?action  \]\]  )   ( SIGN\[\[syn\[e-cat SIGN\]\[e-lex "?~\]\]\] ) environment\[\]
Fig . 4 Phrase Definition Rule
In principle , a phrase definition is equivalent to a syntactic derivation rule augmented with semantics  , other linguistic constraints and environmental constraints  . Generation is executed by activating related phrase definitions successively which can subsume the whole semantics of the input feature structure  . The validity of a combination of phrase definitions is examined using the unification algorithm  . 
Finally , a set of phrase definitions is determined and their combined syntactic structure is produced as a result  . An environment description is not used in the current system  , but will be used to generate a more appropriate x pression i a given context  . 
6. Experiment
The SL-TKANS2 system as developed so far can treat utterances from about  600 vocabulary items . It runs on a UNIX-workstation such as SPARC-2 . Average runtime for one utterance is about one minute  , half for speech recognition and half for translation  . A preliminary experiment has been carried out on five dialogues  , which include 101 sentences . The results are summarized in Table 2 . Input speech material are specific speaker's utterances  .

Number of sentences ( Per cuntage ) speech recognition ( SR ) and translation ( TR ) as a single component arc about 85% and 98% respectively . Correctness of translation is evaluated whether the generated sentences arc grammatical lycorrect and semantically understandable  ( minor errors those involving determiners are ignored  )  . We can see that the translation part has high translation ability as a  *3  ) Th experiment was carried out on string inputs ACRESDE  COLING-92  , NANTES , 2328 AOI~T19921051 PROC , OFCOLING-92 , NANTES , AUG . 2328, 1992 single component .

The system , however , erroneously supplements ' T ' since no honor if ic expression appears in the sentence  . 
In Japanese sentence J2 , a main clause appears later and a pronoun " so re "  ( it ) referring to " teuroku-youshi " ( a registration-form in the first clause is used  . The system does not see this referential rela tionship  , and so it fails to generate a proper English sentence  . 
As a total system , about 84% of the sample sentences are recognized and trans lated into English correctly  . Some examples are shown below .

Generally speaking  , it is desirable that a translation system be able to detect erroneous speech recognition output  . In our system , most of such failures are filtered out , but two sentences are translated into Engl ish  . These undesirable outcomes are due to in adequacy of selectional restrictions used in the translation component  , as indicated below .

7. Conclusion
The main features of the translation component of SL-  TRANS2 are described . The preliminary experiment has shown promis ing results  . We are currently extending not only the vocabulary size from  600 up to 1500  , but also the functionality of the system by improving several functions and introducing a contextual processing mechanism  .
