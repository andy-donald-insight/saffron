This paper reports the progress of the French text -to-speech system being developed at AT&TBell Laboratories as part of a larger project for multilingual text-to-speech systems  , including languages such as Spanish , Italian , German , Russian , and Chinese . These systems , based on diphone and triphone concatenation , follow the general framework of the Bell Laboratories English TTS system\[?\]  ,  \[?\] . This paper provides a description of the approach  , the current status of the French text-to-speech project  , and some problems particular to French . 
1 Introduction
In this paper , the new French text-to-s Ii eech system being developed at AT&T is presented  ; several steps have been already achieved while others are still in progress  . First we present a brief'description of the phonetic inventory of French  , with a discussion of the approach used to select and segment phonetic units for the system  . Methods for automatic segmentation , and for the choice of diphone and triphone units are presented  . Some comments on durational and prosodic issues follow  . We conclude with some discnssions on directions for fllture improw  . ' ment , including morphological analysis , part-of-speech tagging , and partial phrasal analysis for the purpose of phrasal grouping  . 
Phonetic Description of

The French phonetic system consists of 36 phonemes , including 17 consonants , 16 vowels , and 3 semivowels . Table 1 shows the different phonemes ; the IPA column contains the phonemes in the standard International Phonetic Alphabi  , t ; the second column ASCII shows the ascii correspondence of these characters for the text -to-speech system  , and the third column shows art example of the phoneme in a French word  .

Table 1: French Phonetic Phonemes
For the French text-to-speech synthesisy stem we use  35 phonemes , consisting of 17 consonants , 15 vowels ( and not 13 like in then , a cohlmn ) , and 3 semivowels . As shown in Table 1 , the fourth nasal/de/has been removed ,  /07 , / and/g/being represented by the single phoneme / g/  . The reasons for this change are that ( 1 ) /de/tends to be assimilated to the phoneme/g /   , and ( 2 ) this nasal vowel occurs in very few words in French  .

Diphones are structured as \[ bllows : * V , * C , g * , C * , CV , VC , CO , gV where * is a silence , Ca consonant , and Vavowel . Semivowels were treated in the same fashion as consonants  . Diphones were recorded following two ( lif\[erent strategies : the first one consisted of picking existing words from a dictionary list  . The second consisted of deciding on a neutral phonetic on text in using logatornes or nonexisting words  . Logatomes are phonot actiically wellformed strings  , which do not exist as words in the current French language  . 
2 . 1 . 2 Selection of exist ing words from machine -readable dictionary A word list was extracted from a subset of the Robert French dictionary \[? \] and the pronunciation fields were extracted  . The dictionary contains almost 89 , 000 entries , of which 85 , 796 entries con-Lain ahead word , a phonemic transcription , and a part of speech . The remaining entries are prefixes and suffixes . The first task consisted of converting and mapping the dictionary phonemic symbols to the ones adopted in our system  ( shown in table 1 )  . This was not straightforward since there was not always a one-to-one mapping between the two sets  . For handling symbol mapping , a program was written that converts any set of characters to any other set of characters I  . The program is developed so that characters coded in octal or decimal code not only can he translated in either code  , but also can be input in ascii format for being converted  2 Quite often , there was more than one pronunciation in the phonetic field and the  . pattern matching program chose the pronunciation corresponding to the one required  . Moreover , dictionary pro-11 amvery grateflfl to Mike Tanen blatt who wrote this program and made a succession of changes until complete flexibility of character conversion was obtained  . 
2 This tool allowed the conversion ofdatabases originally written on Macintosh  , PC , or Unix . Additionally , we used it to convert all the French textual databases into  latin1   8 bitencoding format . 
nouneiation fields are often not phonetically line -grained enough for acceptable speech output  ( see\[?\] for a discussion on machine-readable dictionaries in text-to-speech systems  )  . Finally , due to the lack of explicit inflectional information for nouns and adjectives  , only the noninflected forms of the entries were extracte during dictionary lookup  . 
Sirnilarly for verbs , only the infinil ; iwd forms were used since the dictionary does not list the intleeted forms as head words  . A program was written to search through the dictionary pronunciation field and select the longest word where the phonenm pairs would be in mid-syllable position in order to avoid the extraction of ' phonemes occuring at the beginning or end of words  . In this way , l , he influence of lexicM stress was reduced . The orthog-raphy/prommciation pair \ [ head word_orth  , head-word q ~ ) hon\]was extracted and head word_orth was placed in a carrier sentence for recording  . Out of 1225 original phonemic pairs , 874 words wet '' . 
found with at least one occurence of the pair . Because 1225 is the number of all phonemic pairs in French whether they are allowed or not  , it is interesting to notice that only 874 pairs occur within real words in the Robert dictionary  . 
2.1.3 Selection of logatomes
For the logato . tes , two phonen , es/a/attd/t/were used to encompass the selected iphone  , since they appear to be fairly stable from a phonetic-acous Licst and point  . In order to balance the alternation of vowel and consonant  , he words were constructed as follows :
Log atome position initial vow.
initial cons.
final vow.
final cons.
COILS . VOW.

Nonetheless , these R ) rms were generated and used since they were necessary for interword phenomena  . Approximately 1225 words were constructed following the abow ~' model  . 
978 l . esearchers disagree as to whether to use logatomes or realwords for synthesis  . The ar-gmnent for using logatom cs is that it is t ) etter to collect nonreal words so that the diphone ix recorded as neutrally as possible and doesuot undergo any realword stress  . Those against argue thai ; the ( \[ iphone is ov ( ~ r-articulated in a log atome environment and that it reduces l  , he naturahmss of the synthesizeds l ) eech . The choice is more cornplex in the sense that it greatly depends on the speaker  , the articulation , and the comfort in reading the two diff (' . rent sets . Given the controvers y , in the present system , we decided to record the l ) houe miet ) airs in bot ; henvironments , othaiwe (: ould choose the best ones ,  2  . 2 The other polyphonic units I ) ue to the variability of liquids and semivowels , synthesis based only on ( liphones will uot give good results . Indeed , such systems have prov cuto be insut\[icient . Researchers \[?\] arguel ; hadi-\] ) holle COll cat ( ?ll~tti on a lolleisll Ota ( l ( 2 ( lt late or sl/f-ticient , particularly for complex transitions . \[?\] claims that " Meal diphones with perfect ( ; on catc-nation would giw ~ imperf(~ct results " . Complex polypho , ~es are not equivalent to concatenated all-phones . Therefore , louger concatcnativ ( ~ units are necessary . Polyphones are defined by \['/\] as being a segmental unit where the initial and linal phoneme are not subject to variability  , thus , excluding liquids and semivowels . 
The strategy chosen in the Fre . nch system relies on some phoneticge . neralities to build a set of tril ) honcs . It was decided a to form a (: lass of tri-phoues , based on the following transition : I'VC ' ~ , where 1) is a phoneme , Vavowel , and Ccaconson autrel ) resenl , ative of the ~ trticulatory locations , i . e . one velar , one dental , and one nasal . The set consisted then of 35 phones x 14 vowels x 3 consonants = t47  ( ) triphon ( : s . The same methodology used for building the set of  ( liptlones was used for the triph on ( ~' s . These were in chMe ( I in a carrier word for the logatomes and extracted from the dictionary for the real words  . 
Researchers disagree on which criteria are best for the selection of triphones  ; should the selectiourely on phonectic-a <: oustic < widence  , or on statistical evidence , related to tl , efi'equency of occurrence of triphones in the language ? Then  , once the (: rite-ria is defined , which triphones hou hl be selected ? Can candidates of a class  ( say the phoneme / p/ 3 personal communication with Joe Olive representing all the stops  , the phoneme . /v/repre-seut mg all thefficatiw~s ) be picked to rel ) resent a class or sit ( mid all the phonemes belonging to the class he sekwted ?

Finally , he . cause then nml ) er of selected units atfects results , the choi ( ' e of polyphones must be Ilia ( h ! with care . ' l'aking ill to accotlrlt the size limitalion , one has to balanc ( ~ out the choice of the polyphones considering its frequency in ~ he  . language . 
This brings in the additional complexity of cort ) us selection ( its language properties , dialects , socioling u is l , ict yl ) e of language , topic , and size ) . 
\[?\] applies a series of rules on phoneum coln -bination to exclude interword concatenation that would not occur in French  . For example , one cannot lindaglide , in I ' ~ rench that ix not in the left or right cont ; ext of a vowel ; therefore , the combination consonant-glide-consonant is excluded  . An optimal set of polyphone combinations is computed that re  . a chesatmmber of 7725 units . Calculated from texts , statistics are then run on these illlits to ( teterlllille the most freqllell to c (  ; iH'elH ; es in French , and the numbex of units is lowered to 3000 , It remains to be seen whether this al ) proacllis successfid liua workiug system . 
2.3 Construction of the corpus
A carrier sentence " C'est CAI ~ I ~ ItgI~_WO nl ) qlleJCd is " was selected to fulfill the following require i ' qeill  . s : ? short sentelice ~ to record , ? ability t ( ) surrourid the ' carrier word to avoid selfl , ential accent and effects , ? phonetically neutral environment . 
2  . 4 Cho ice o f a Speaker l?ive male natiw : speakers of Continental French were interviewed for selc'cting tile voice of the lq'eneh synthesizer  . A sample of text representing highly o ('( ; uring graphemic trigrams waxpre-pare . d to be used in this task . The corpus wax run through a greedy algorithm 4 that returned the most frequent words within their sentences  4''hanks to . In n Van Santen for developing and running his greedy algorithm  . 
9 79 along with a measure corresponding to the coverage of the graphemic triphone  . Once tile sample was recorded by tire 5 speakers , the natural voices were run through LPC analysis and re-synthesize  . d in order to judge the resistance of tile voice to synthesis  . Five subjects were asked to give their judgcrnent on the following criteria : clear articulation : tile voice was carefully listened to evaluate tire articulation of the speaker  . Subjective perceptual judgements were lnade . 
2 . neutral French accent : the candidate was asked about tile areas of Franc  ( : where hegrew up . The central area of France " l'I le de France " is known for its neutral accent and is regarded as being a well-received accent  . Additionally , for French native speakers residing in the USA , particular attention was paid to the influence of English intire prommcia-lion of French  , especially for English borrowings , such as for example , the company name AT&T to be pronounced/atere / ( the French way ) and not ; /eltnt/as in English . 
regularity : special attention was given to ensure that the speaker would have a reasonable degree of regularity in uttering French phonemes  . 
ph : a santness of the voic ( . ': the subjects doing the evaluation were asked to give their opinion on the pleasantness of the voice  , in particular the timber , the level of nasality , and the intonation . Of course , this is a highly subjective matter but a critical one for success  . 
2.5 Recording Conditions
The recording was done on four nonconsecutive days under the following conditions  . Th c sentences were recorded directly onto the computer through a  1  ) AT ( Digital audio ' rape ) tape recorder , using interactive software allowing easy reading and repetition of the sentences Lobe recorded  . Additional time was devoted to the recording of triphones as well as the re-recording of sentences that were improperly uttered  . The same carrier sentence and a regular prosodic context was carefully maintained so that there was mini-real suprase gmental variation  . Once the recording was done , the 48 kHz digitized acoustic signal was downsized to 12 kllz . 
2 . 6 Transcr ip t ion of record ing lna-ter ial For the recording  , all sentences were transcribed from the phonetic alphabet to an orthographic Ibrrnat  . This was done to allow tile speaker to uttersent (  ; nees with more naturalness . Once the recording was dor lc'~th ( " sentences were set ni-automatically re -transcribed in tophon c % c form  . 
For some ~ utterances , the phon ( ' tictranscription was manually adjusted to the idiosynerasi  (  ; s of the speaker . For example , it often happened that confusion arises between open and closed vowels  , such in the ~ ord ' ~ zoologique " zoological that can be pronomt cedeither/zooloaik/or / za alosik /  . 
In case the output was/zooloaik/instead of the expe  ( % ed/za alosik / , the transcription was read-justed . 
2.7 Segmentation
Segmentation is presently in progress ; efforts are being pursued to adapt an automatic segmentor for English to French and other languages  . In the meantime , rnannal segmentation is being done as a pilot experiment in order to cheek the accuracy of automatic segmentation  . Beyond the scope of this paper are many complex issues raised in segmenting French  , such as the segmentation of semi-voweds (/ j / , / w / , and / q /) and liquids (/ l / and / r /) , each of these phonemes being quite unstable f?om a phonetic-~eoustics t and point  . These issues will be addressed in hmm ; work . 
2 . 8 Integration of an orthographic transcriber A grapheme-to-phoneme transcriber\[?\] was acquired to convert French orthography to a phone  . -miere presentation . The software performs some syntactic and partial semantic analysis of the sentence in order to disambiguate the input string  . 
Once performed , spellings at 0 . converted in a series of steps into a phonernic representation  . 
3 Issues in Text Analysis
We have t ) nrsued work in the text analysis of French in order to obtain linguistic data for intonation and prosody  ; additionally , the output of the work will be used in the translation project  . 
This aspect of the work has entailed several points : ? acquisition of a large French dictionary : lt  . obcrt Encyclopedic dictionary ( containing tatious , analogical terms ( synonyms , ho-nonlylns , el , (;) , and conjugatiou tables for illOStl ? rerl ( ; \[ lverl)s ) , ? collectiol ~ of French corpora : i , ' rcneh news from LI' ; M()NI)I' ; \[?\] I /' retlch news daily <: ompih ' . d by the

The French TTS system is part of a large project of multiliugua \] text-to-sl > eech synthesis ill progress at AT?'T Bell I ~ ahoratories  . Speech synthesis for French brings a variety of chalh ! nges  , some of which are specific to French , such as nasalization , liaison , schwa realization , etc . and some of which are more general issues , such as vowelhmg then = ing , prosodic cont , our ing , and intonation . Several systems are . in exp < ! rined ; alstages for other languages , such as Spanish ( Castilian as well as South Ame . ri<'ar0 , Italian , Chinese , Navajo , German , aud Russian .
