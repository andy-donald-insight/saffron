A proposed " Matrix " method for the represent at ion of the inflectional paradigms of Arabic words is presented  . This representation results in a class if ication of Arabic words into a tree struc ture  ( Fig ( l )   ) whose leaves represent unique conjugational or derivational paradigms  , each represented in the proposed " Matrix " form . 
A study of about 2 , 5 00 stems from a high frequency Arabic wordList due to Landau < I > has revealed a systematic set of cooccurrence patterns for the encLitic pronouns of Arabic verbs and for the possessive pronouns attached to Arabic nouns  . Each cooccurrence pattern represents a subcategorization frame that reflects the underlying semantic relationship  . 
The key feature that distinguishes these semantic patterns has been observed to be whether the attached suffixes relate to the animate or inanimate  . 
In some cases for verbs , the number of the subject is also a sign if icant feature  . These semantic features also extend to non-at tached subjects and objects  ( for verbs ) and to possessive noun complements ( for nouns )   . Therefore the semantic classes presented in this paper also assist in syntactic/semantic analysis  . 
The first application that W as developed , based upon the proposed representaion is a stem -based Arabic morphological ans/yser  , from which a spell checker ( on a PS/2microcomputer ) emerged as a byproduct . Currently , the system is being used to interact with an Arabic syntactic parser and there are plans to use it in a machine assisted translation system  . 
i . INTRODUCTION
Over the past few years there has been a marked increase in the use of computers in the Arabic speaking countries  . Many applications programs in Arabic have been developed  , but the field of computations/linguistics is relatively new in Arabic and presents a unique challenge  , due to the highly inflected nature of the Arabic language  . 
In the present work , we have attempted to represent the morphological rules governing the inflections of Arabic words in a compact form which can simplify the processing of Arabic words by computers and which is independent of the a particular appl ication  . There have been other attempts to show the conjugations of Arabic verbs  <2> but the treatment does not delve into suffic ient depth and not all enclitics  , which are an essential part of Arabic verbs , are considered . Moreover , the treatment in <2> does not extend to nouns . 
By studying some 2 , 5 00 stems out of a high frequency Arabic word list due to Landau  <1>  , certain systematico-occurrence patterns governing verb enclitics and noun possessive pronouns have been observed  . These patterns are what we call " Matrices " in this paper  ; each unique " Matrix " reflects a different semantic behaviour  . 
To summarize Arabic morphology in a nutshell , about 80 ~ , of Arabic words can be derived from a For example  , if we consider the root ~ , ~( KTB ) , we can form words such as . l -, . r_ . .?~ (? aKTuB - I wr ite ) and , ~( KiTa:B-book ) , by subjecting the root to various " forms " or " moulds " and by undergoing certain morphophonemic  ( and possibly also morpho-graphemic ) hanges . For a full discussion of traditional Arabic morphology see  <9> and <10>  . In this paper , we shall define such an inflected form to be a " STEM "  . 
Thus a stem may contain infixes and certain prefixes which are part of the " mould " but may not contain any suffixes  . Suffixes for verbs are subject and object pronouns  , while for nouns they are possessive pronouns . 
One further definition which is used in the proposed representaion is the " Core "  ; this is simply the inflected form with all prefixes and suffixes stripped off  . The core may or may not be a valid word . 
In comparison with other work in the area of traditional Arabic morphology  ( <3> , <4>) , where the concern is with the rules which cause the inflected form to be derived from the ROOT  , we have studied the rules governing the derivation of all possible inflected forms from the STEM  , as defined above . 
2. THE MATRIX REPRESENTATION
Sample " MATRIXPARADIGMS " are shown in
Fig(2) for verbs and Fig (3) for nouns . Table ( 1 ) gives the keys in English to the columns on the Matrix Paradigms  . The inflected form for a given Person/Number ~ Gender/Mode combination for verbs  ( obtained from the relevant " row " of the Matrix Paradigm  ) is constructed by concatenating the prefix , core and both subject and object pronoun column entries  . The inflected forms for nouns ares in filarly constructed for a particular 
Number/Gender/Case combination.
The various " cells " of the object pronoun columns indicate whether a particular entry is valid  ( indicated by " U ' , an Arabic numer alone ) . Invalid entries are indicated by a "'" , an Arabic zero . It is due to this matrix of ones and zeros that the representation was named the " Matrix Paradigm "  . 
3. TAXONOMY OF ARABICWORDS
Fig ( l ) shows a tree diagram representing the taxonomical classification of Arabic verbs and nouns  . There are different " levels " in the tree cor respond to different types of variations of the inflected form from one class to another  . The first type of variation coincides more or less with the traditional classification and is respresented at levels  2 and 3 for verbs and at level 2 for nouns . 
Each Matrix Paradigm also reflects two further types of variation  , which can be considered separately from one another  . The first is the variation in the core with the different rows  ; this dimension corresponds , for example , to the traditional study of verb conjugations ( see <2> )  . 
-I-distribution of the Matrix of ones and zeros  , which is essentially a variation in the cooccurrence of object pronouns  ( for transitive verbs ) and possessive pronouns ( for nouns )  . This variation is reflected at level 4 of the taxonomy . In the following sections 3 . 1 and 3 . 2 , we will discuss the study of these cooccurrence patterns in more detail for verbs and nouns separately  . 
3.1 CO-OCCURRENCE PATTERNS FOR VERBS
On examination of the Landau < I > high frequency word list  , the following feature seemed to distinguish classes of verbs apart :  1- Whether the subject is human or nonhuman ( for both transitive and intransitive verbs  )   . 
2-Whether the object is human or nonhuman ( for transitive verbs only )   . 
3 - The number of the subject ( for intransitive " verbs only )   . 
in Arabic , there is a set of object pronouns which refers to a nonhuman object :  ( t . , ~, ~, a ) and this will be denoted by-H . This is a subset of the complete set of pronouns + H  , which denotes human and nonhuman . Below , we will discuss the features for transitive and hit ransitive verbs separately :  ( a ) Transitive Verbs : As shown in the table below  , there can only be 4 combinations of the features + H and - H . Each of the feature sets in the table has been designated a classcede  . Only verbs with features corresponding to the feature sets B  , C and D have been found in the Landau < I > short list examined  . 
Feature Set code ~
B+H+H
C+H-H
D*H-H?-H-H ( b ) Intz-ansitive Verbs : It was found out that the subject number is an additional distinguish ing feature for transitive verbs  . Moreover , the subject number is sigmificant only in the case of human subjects  . For nonhuman subjects , this feature is not significant . 
Based upon the above observations , we will define the distinguishing features for intransitive verbs to be + H  ( s )   , + H(dp ) and - H , where s denotes singular and dp denotes dual / plural  . + H ( s ) and + H ( dp ) denote the sets of singular and dual/plura l subjects  , respectively . By definition + t(s)U+H(dp)-H , where U denotes the union of the two feature sets  . The table below shows the possible combinations of these features  ; only features designated by A , E and F were found for
Landau's < 1> short tist.

Three distinct classes of Matrix patterns ( see level 3 of Fig ( l )   ) have been observed for nouns : ~2- ( A ) No possessive pronouns can be attached . 
( B ) All possessive pronouns can be attached.
( C ) Only possessive pronouns related to the inanimate  ( set-H ) can be attached . 
An additional study was made to determine what Number/Gender  ( NG ) combinations are valid for a particular noun stem  . These have been found to be an important feature of Arabic nouns  , as not all NG combinations are valid for a stem ? Each stem needs to be examined separately and this information is put into the lexicon of stem  . The NG combinations are represented at level 3 of the taxonomy , for nouns ( see Fig(l )) . 
Although there is no systematic , theoretical method for detern fining what all the different NG combinations are for comprehensive coverage of nouns  , yet by examining more and more nouns from Landau ' s < I > word list  , some form of convergence occurred . For the 2 , 500 stem short list , there were only 17NG combinations . 
This curious feature of Arabic nouns can be mainly attributed to the presence of words of foreign origin and to the pragmatics of the noun in question  . 
4. APPLICATIONS DEVE LOPED
As a first application , an Arabic stem-based morphological analyser has been developed on an IBM  PS/2 microcomputer . Morphological features of the word analysed are computed  . 
As a by-product of the analyser , an Arabic spelling verifier has been developed , by including unification of the morphological nd cooccurrence features of the morphemes  . 
The system is currently being developed for . use in the interaction with an Arabic syntactic parser  .
