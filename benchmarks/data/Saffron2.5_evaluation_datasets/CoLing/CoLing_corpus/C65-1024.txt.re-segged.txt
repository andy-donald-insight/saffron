Abstract : The notions of generation , production , synthesis etc . are analyzed , with the conclusion , that the description of a natural language should have ~ a creative and a transductive part  . As a system meeting the principal known conditions  , a sequence of pushdowns to retransducers , interpreted as a stra-t~f ~ cational language descrlption ~ is proposed  .

I . IIn the works of N . ~ homsky , P . M . Postal , J . J . Katz and others there are formulated three zeneral aims of generative grammar : a  ) the grammar generates fall and only the grammatical sentences of the doscribed languase  , in the sen Be of a mathem , ~tical enumeration of the set of grammatical sentences  ; b ) the grammar automatically ascribes to each generated sentence a structural d~scription  , not contradictory to the intuitive evidence of native speakers ~ if the same sentence is generated by the grammar in ~ different ways  , ~ different structural descriptions a ~ eascribed to it ~ c  ) the grammar is a description of the mechanism the user of the language has internalized and uses in the process of langua-ge  co~2  . unication ( as a speaker , hearer etc . ) . 
There are , of course , other aims or conditions laid upon generative grammars  , e . g . those concerning degrees of grmmmati ~ calness of sentences  . But our main point here concerns the three conditions cited  ; we assume that these a ~ eactually three different conditions  , in particular that ~ and ~ are not ident lca ~ being implied by ~  , so that a grammar can exist , which satisfies the conditions A and ~ , but not ~ . 
I ~2 If we examine the new version of transformational descript-i~n ~ from that point of view  , we see that there are difficulties concerning the ccndition ~  . Of course , we are now applying the conditions not only to the grammar  , but to the whole description , including its semantic component . ~ e are not certain , however , that the mutual relations of the thyee components of this description have been characterized quite correctly  . There is one creative component , ( A ) , whose output is interpreted by
Sgall 5 both ( B ), i . e . semantics , and ( C ) ; but then-in my opinion - ( A ) ig the basis ( including lexical rules )  , and the transformational and phonological parts 0elong to ( C )  . Whether this is the case or not , the formulation of the new shape of the transformational description is a further and important step in overcoming the one-sidedness of descriptivism  . An adequate basis for fulfilling the conditions g and ~ may be considered to have been reached in ~ his way  . 
But our question remains : can this system really be considered to describe the mechanism used in speech communication ? J  . J . Katz writes (/5/, p . 4 ; similarly in /6/ ) : " The whole process may be pictured as follows: the speaker  , for reasons that are biographically relevant but linguistically not  , chooses a message he wants to convey to the hearer  .   .   .   . This message is translated into syntactic form by the selection of a syntactic structure whose semantic interpretation is this message ~' Of course  , the question , why a particular message has been chosen , is not a linguistic one . But if the mechanism used by the speaker to translate the message into syntactic form were to be described as a device for translating  , not just for selection , this other description would be preferable , as to that point . 
1 . 3 The generative description is neutral to the speaker and to the hearer  , i . e . to the production and understandlng of sentences . But in a sense the generation is nearer to the production  , just as the recognition procedure is nearer to the understanding of sentences  . That is , the sentence appears as an output string in the generative description and in the process of production  , whereas in the recognition routine and in the process of understanding it appears as an input string  . 
N . C~omsky introduced the distinction of the competence and the performance of language users  ; ~ the methodological importance of
Sgall 4 this distinction is undeniable . But it is not evident whether the generative grammar is the same as the description of the competence of both speaker and hearer  ; it is not clear whether a recognition grammar belongs to the realm of performance  ( CfoHays/4Tp . 8/)  , or to the realm of competence , also ( cf ~ catego-rical and other grammars , formulated as recognition grammars , e . g . / I / , but not intended as models of the hearer's activity  )  . 
One sees , of course , that the actual programs for random generation of sentences  /17  , 9/ are not models of the speaker's activity , either . But that is not due , perhaps , to their being related to generative grammars . 
So our questions are : H as a description of the user's coz~petence to be neutral with regard to the speaker and the hea~er ?  ( Or , better : Are all the differences between the speaker's and the he~rer's activity due only to their performance  , are there no differences which should be respected in a description of their competence  , of the mechanism they have internalized ?) And , further : If the generative description is neutral in this respect  , is the recognition description also neutral ?-~ f we assume that the set of grammatical ~ entences is a recursive one  , then why should we prefer ~ eneration as the form af the description of lanA ~ age  , and not recognition ?2 . 1 . The mechanism internalized by the user of a language enables him  ( I ) to choose a message as such , ( II ) to formulate this message , i . e . to translate it from its " semantic " form to one of the corresponding phonetic forms  , ( IIl ) to " interpret " , or understand a sentence , i . e . to translate it f~omits phonetic form to an ~ of the corresponding " semantic " forms  , ( IV ) to choose the most appropriate form , while translating in either direction . 
The parts ( I ) and ( IV ) cannot be fully described by linguistic
Sgall 5 means alone . As to parts ( II ) and ( III) , we see that they are essentially translating procedures  . They may include some blocking or checking sub parts  , but we should try to describe at least their main parts astr~msducers or in some similar way  ( or , alternatively , to show that this is impossible ) . 
The vast and heterogeneous field presystematically called elements in it which belong to the " transductive " part of the mechanism and are purely linguistic  ; ~ the relations between levels or strata of thel ~ n ~ uage system can be described as " semantic " relations  ( relations of " representation " , with the socalled " as symetrical 2 dualism " , i . e . generally many vj-tozmany relations / ~, I ~ . On the other hand , there are othe ~ quite distinct , " semantic " problems , concerning the manner of choice of a message itself  , and \ of these only some are intrinsically linguistic  ( e . g . questions concerning a nal ~ contradiction ) . 
2 . 2 Even if the mechanism briefly outlined above could be integrally described  , it ~ ould be a description of the competence , not of the perfd~mance of a user of language . It would not describe , particularly , the relations connected with restrictions of memory and other faculties of individual speakers  , nor v ~ rious possible shortcuts used during the process of speech  . It would hardly be possible to de ~ cyibe , by linguistic means , the conditions under by which a construction is being built upV the speaker during the act of speech  , and the conditions under which it is delivered as a whole by the memory ~ only extreme eases  , where there is only the latter ~ possibility , are distinguished explicitly by the grammar ; the former constructions are , e . g . " analytical " forms of newly coined or accepted words formed " by analogy "  ; at the other extreme are idioms , " irregular " forms and other " exceptions " , which have to be listed
Sgall 6 by the grammar . In most cases , there are both possibilities , and it is not one of the purposes of linguistics to say whether  ( or , under what conditions ) the spe~ker chooses the first or the second . 
We can say , then , that the distinction between competence and performance is independent from that between speaker and hea~er  . 
If the description contains some part ( s ) used only by the speaker , and others used only by the hearer , it does not follow that it is no longer a description only of their competence  . 
2 . 3 . If I understand correctly the words of J . J . Katz , cited in 1 . 2 , then he defines the message as a unit of the semantic level  ( the message is a semantic interpretation of a sentoid  )  . Enumeration of all possible messages ( of a language ) is a necessary part ( or prerequisite , perhaps ) of a description of a language , and it is , of course , preferable that the mechanism of this enumeration should ascribe structural descriptions to the generated messages  ( see in 1 . 1) . But it is not elear whether the transformational description really can serve as such an enumeration  . If so ( e . g . if the semantic component does not , as a filter , block an infinite number of sentoids ) , then it would be possible to reverse the semantic component in some way  ( to discover its inverse machine )  , and use this inverted procedure as the description of the mechanism the speaker uses while translating the message to its syntactic form  . 
If there is no such possibility , then the semantic component in its present form is not satisfactory  , either . 
Onth ~ other hand , it is not necessary , in a linguistic description , to ~ enerate the set of messages by a system which could serve as a model of the mechanism internalized by the users of a language  ( 1 . 1 . ~) . Bearing in m ~ n d , that the description of the complicated relations between the semantic and phonetic levels  , and not the selection of the message , belongs to the classical aims of linguistics , we can model not the . : ~ echanism used by the speaker and the
Sgall 7? hearer , but %~ used by the translator , who has to discover the ~ K " meaning ( s ) pertaining to a certain phonetic string and vice versa  , 
I but not to choose the meaning itself . ( Butcf . 3 . 3 . ) ~ Of course , we have to distinguish here between cases where translation proceeds only as an operation on texts  , without using other than linguistics knowledge and knowledge obtained from the translated text itself  , and cases , where the translator has to obtain from external sources information not contained in the text but D  ~  1 "" ~' ~ ~ e ~ eq , ired by the grammar of the output lan~uag ( in cases as " king John's son " tran~l~ted to German " ein Sohndes  K6nigs J . " or " der Sohn . " of . /13/ ) We are concerned here only with transla-"? 3 ? tion in the narrow sense ;  , the mechanism descrioed does not enable the translator to select one of the possibilities in the cases where such external information is necessary  . 
3 . 1 ? Viewed ? in this way , the generative system should have ~ , htwQparts : a purely generative one , serving to enumerate possible messages , or meanings of messages , and another " transductive " part , describing the tr~nslation of messages from one level to another  . 
The message can be composed , of course , of many sentences , but , as is usual today , we take no account of the difference and speak of sentences on l ~ in the Sequel  . 
This sj stem should not be more elaborate than necessary  , but there are some known conditions it has to fulfil  . As to weak gene-rative power , it has to generate not only the sets of strings gene-2ated by a contextfree phrase structure grammar , but also at least set of all strings of the form xa_~x  , where ~ is a symbol o~he the output vocabulary and ~ is any string of such symbols not containing ~  ; cf . , in a somewhat different formulation , /12/ . As to strong generative power , the system has to ascribe not only taxonomical structural descriptions  , i . e . there must be a possibility of having ' Sgall 8 structural descriptions not just for sentences , but for several levels of sentence structure , such as the deep structure and the surface structure  . 
3 . 2 . One possible system meeting these conditions is a sequence of pushdowns to retransducers  /11  ; 3/ , interpreted as a stratificational description /8 ; 14/ . Its first , generative and recur-sire part would be a contextfree phrase structure grammar or as ys-T~r ~ ~\] rtem  . . . . ~ . ly equivalent to it , enumerating the " sentence meanings " ~ in such a way that the output string itself serves as the description of the sentence structure at this level  . This stringist~mslated then by another pushdowns to retransducer  6r other ~ a ~ transducers ) to the level of " surface stA'ucture " ( al & nearized tree versionOf the dependency mx ~ of the sentence  )  , and furt-her to the morphological level . For a ~ of such a system , see/15; 16/ . 
We can formulate the first part of this system so as to gene-rate all strings of the form x a_  . _xx " and only them ( where ~" is the reflection of ~ )  , and the second part can consist of the following rules  ( symbolized here as done by Evey , with some simplification ; denotes any symbol of the input alphabet other than ~  ) : input pinn . --@ inn . p state state b 1   1 a 1   2 b 2 Zb 3 stop ! output b
Sgall 9
The output of this translator would be xax , whenever x a__ . x xwar its input string . So the first condition of 3 . 1 . is fulfilled . It should be noted that we are not u~3ing the word " translate " in the technical sense used by R  . J . Evey ; the input language of our translator contains the set of the strings xax " as its propers ub ~  . ~et . 
There is still a possibility that , at least for some languages , a description would be adequate where the input language of each translator is the same as the output language of its predecessor in the sequence of machines  . Th@weak generative power of such a system would then equal that of a contextfree phrase structure l ~ m guage  ( cf . /13/, theorem 2:6 . 6) . 
As to the socond condition , concerning stror ~ generative power , our system , as a stratification alone , shares the main property of transformational description and cannot be held to be taxonomic  . 
There ~ rethree levels or strata ( not to speak of phonology amd phonetics ; but the question of the nmmber of strata is an empirical one and it is possible that typologically different languages do not coincide in this respect  ; we are working v~ith inflected languages , such as Czechor ~ ussian ) : the tectogrammatical or " semantic " level ( Lo )   , the phenogrammatical level ( surface structure , L 1 ) , and the morpholoical level ( L2) . The sequence of representations of a sentence on each of these levels  , smember of L~LIXL 2 ~ ul filling the condition that each of its elements is derivable by the transducer system  ( from its predecessor in the sequence , if Shore is any ) , is a structural description of that sentence . A complete derivational history is not needed here  , because the symbols useful for the structural description appear in the terminal strings of the transducers  , so that these strings ( or some of them , as a sequence of two transducers is generally needed to translate the sentence f ~ mone level to a ~ other  ) themselves serve as the
Sgall I0 representations of sentences at the corresponding level  . 
So , not a unique description of the ss~actic structure is ascribed to a sentence  ( with no homonymy ) but , rather , two distinct descriptions ( elements of L0 and L1 , respectively ) , whose mutual relation can be compared with that of Chomsky's deep structure and surface structure  . In cases such as questions , grammatically conditioned change of word order apparently disturbing the constituent structure of the ~ entence  , nominalizations etc . , the rules of our system are to a great extent parallel to those of the tr~ns formational description  . But cases such as the passive or lexical synony L ~ and honlonymy are handled in our system in such a % way that the representation of the sentence at the tecto ~ rammatical level is unique for the synonymous expressions  ( and distinct , of course , for the homonymous ones ) . 
The third level of our system , the morphological , includes categories of " rectlon " and concord , not included in the " syntactic " levels . 
3 . 3 . The recursive component of our system , w~th the initial symbol ~ and the gradual derivation of the terminal string first by rules of expansion and then by rules of selection  , does not __ ~ , stated in 2 . 3, it is not necessa-Wulfil condition co , ?1 . I . But , ?ry that a linguistic description should contain a description of the mecl~nismused by the speaker in that part of his activity  . Rossibly this gap can be filled in the future by reformulation of the gene--ration routine  . 
There are other difficulties in this component , concerning the condition ~ . The main point here is the formulation of context restrictions relevant to the selection of terminal symbols  ; we think that it is possible to define various partitions on the vocabulary of this component  , so that we can work with rule schemata
Sgall 11 not only as with a conventional simplification of notatien ~ but also as with an intrinsic part of the system  ; ~ the weak equivalence with a contextfree phrase structure grammar should not be lost by this  . 
Another remark concerns the confron Yation of the tectogra-mmatical levels of two language % necessarily made by a translator  . 
An ideal case of translation would be the full coizcidence of both these levels  . Generally j the translator , if he is to translate corre G ~ ly , is supposed to use ( as a part of the mechanism interna-lized ) some routine converting strings of the tecto & Tammatical level of the input language to those of the output language  . This part of the mechanism is not as yet described by our system  , as we consider one language only , i . e . a translator translating from his mother tongue to the some l~nguage  . But elaboration of this part of the system is needed  , and is directly relevant to Machine Translation as well as to general linguistic theory  . 
3 . 4 . The transducers have to fulfil certain special conditions  , so that the existence not only of an inverse machine ~ bireach of them but also of a recognition routine for the whole system is ensured as well  . These conditions , which we shall not present here in full , are parallel to the absence of deletion rules in a phrase structure grammar under similar circumstances  . We can say , informally , that no symbol re~d in the input is deleted by the rules of a transducer  , except in cases where that symbol can be determined uniquely by the resulting output  . Free deletions are confined to transduction from the morphonological to the phonological level  , or from the phonological to the phonetic level . At those stages , the existence of a recognition routine is given by the fact that the corresponding transducers are finite state #  . 
The system can serve then , in its transductive part , as a
Sgall 12 description of a part of the translator's competence  , as well as a basis for translational ~ or ithm us . As to the actual performance , as well as the actual algorithms , here various digressions from the process defined by the transducer system can be found  , as well as restrictions due to the finite memory etc  . A hearer performing ( mostly in an unconscious way , probably ) the process of understan-ding a sentence , does not have to follow the rules of the abpve mentioned inverse machines punctually  . He can use various shortcuts or trial-and-error methods  , checking the results ( cf . Matthews ,/ I0/) . Butt ~ at may also be true for the speaker , as far as we know . 
3 . 5 . With regard to terminology , it is possible to distinguish several pairs of notions concerning routines of both kinds : the sentence  ( its phonetic representation ) is in the output enumeration ~ eneration in the input decision recognition synthesis analysis production understanding note definition of a set  . . . combined with automatic a~3cribing of structural description . . . interpretable as the description of the mechanism used by the translator  . . . process of performance 4 . So we arrive at the conclusion that the connection bwt ween the theory of grammar and the purposes of Machine Translation is an intrinsic one  . It is of importance to practical research ( where research on MT , using the findings of the theory of grammar and algebraic linguistics  , makes possible through study of its empirical
Sgall IS questions and testing of its working hypotheses  )  . Moreover , the relation ~ ship between the theory and the purposes of tr ~ Lnslation has a bearing on the understanding of the theoretical co~epts themselves  . And the importance of this a ~ pect Will increase , probably , as theory proceeds from the study of individual l ~nguages to the ~ escription of language universals and other relations between natural lsngu ~% es  , and to the description of language in generalo
