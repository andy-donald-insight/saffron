1 Introduction
Conventional approaches to machine translation are mostly concerned with written text  , such as technical documents . This paper addresses the problem of spoken -language translation and explains the method and its capability to handle spoken language  . 
2 Seven requ i rements fo r spoken - language t ranslation The following new design features are critical for success in spoken-language translation :  1  . Incremental processing Incremental processing is required so as to handle fragmental phrases or incomplete utterances and to realize a realtime response  . 
This has a very close relation with item 5 below.
2. Handling spoken language
Fragmental phrases , isolated phrases , a gradient of case role changing , complex topicalization , metonymical phrases , idiomatic expressions foretique tte , and inconsistent expressions in one utterance are main characteristics of spoken language  . They strongly depend on dialogue situations . 
3. Handling euphemistic expressions
Under the influence of social position or situation  , euphemistic expressions appear in various scenes in various forms  . 
4. Deterministic processing
Neither pre-editing nor postediting can be relied on in a speech translation system  . Interactive disambiguation by speakers does not necessarily converge a correct interpretation  . 
5 . Sufficient speed to avoid to break communic at ion As an interpreter intervenes between speakers  , realtime response is required to keep smooth turn taking  . 


High-quality translation
This is necessary in order to ensure correct information exchange between speakers  . 
Recovering from speech recognition errors There are various aspects to recovering from speech recognition errors  , for example in correcting phoneme sequences , syllable sequences , word sequences ( including compound words and collocations )  . 
3 Meeting the seven requirements 3 . 1 Incremental processing This is an essential technology if one is to build an incremental translation system like a simultaneous interpreter  , and the proper way to grasp a chunk of a translation unit corresponding to some chunk in a target language is to extend ' constituent boundary parsing ' to bottom-up-type parsing \ [  Furuse96\]  . 
3.2 Recovering from errors
A certain recovery method is now under consideration : are-entrizing model for phoneme candidates by means of searching the correct phonemes using modification depending on recognition error characteristics in an example -based frame wbrk\[  Wakita95\]  . This approach provides are covery effect in handling phoneme or syllable sequences  , and the effect depends on the particular speakers because of individual error characteristics  . 
3.3 Requirements covered by

The remaining requirements are handled effectively by an example-based approach as explained here  . 
In NLP systems , especially for spoken language , many possibile syntactic structures are produced . 
It is an important and difficult process to choose the most plausibile structure  . Conventional ap-proachs , such as knowledge-based one , cannot easily handle continuous phenomena : gradation of case role changing  ; derivation of a metonymical word and the main predicate  . 
We have proposed Example-Based
Machine 3? anslation ( EBMT ) to deal with these difliculties\[Sumita92-a\] . The EBMT method prepares a large number of translation examples  ; the translation example that most closely matches the input expression is retrieved  ; and tile example is n fimicked . 
When applying F , BM'F to sentence translation , the sentence must be analyzed by matching transaltion patterns of phrases \[  Furuse94\]  . This model is in a sense " driven by transfer " , and we call it Transfer-Driven Machine % anslation  ( TDMT )  . 
3.3.1 Handling spoken language
Spoken language includes many phenomena ; here , howew ' . r , we concentrate on the following ones : ( 1 ) " wa " is a Japanese topic marker and , in general , this marker cant ) ere placed by other case particles . But some usages cannot be identified as to case role because of gradation of case role changing  . Moreover , if there are double topic markers in a sentence , they cannot I ) ereplaced by other particles1 . The first sentence in our Japanese-to-English ( JE ) translation " snapshot " ( Figure 1 )  , for exam- . 
ple , is properly translated in our TI ) MT prototype system . 
( i ) " Chikatetsu-waichiban-chikaieki-wa doko desu ka  . "(' subway-topiealized , '' the nearest , '' station-topicalized , '' where , '' be-question ' )   ( 2 ) Two sentences are mixed in one utterance . 
The tirst is pended , then in unedaitely the second sentence starts without conjunction  . 
( ii ) "Shiharai-wa ginkou-fllrikomi-oo-machi-shite - or iI nasu  . "(' payment-topicalized , '' bank-transfer-objective , '' wait-for-polite-modest ') a . a . = H and lingeuphemistic expressions ( 1 ) There are various types of expressions for politeness  , modest y , and euphemism . Such expressions are used depending on social roles  . The fourth sentence in our Japanese-to-Korean ( JK ) translation snapshot ( Figure 2 ) is a sample of this type , which is properly dealt with by TI ) MT . 
( iii ) " Yo yaku-wokakunin-sasete-itadaki-masu . "1 In this paper , sample Japanese sentences are written alphabetically and surrounded by double quotes  , and the corresponding English words with usage modifiers follow in parenthesis  . 
(' reservation-objective , '' confirm-modest ' )   ( iv ) "Go-dengon-woo-tutae-moushiage-masu . "(' message-polite-objective , '' inform-honorific ') 3 . 3 . 3 Deterministic processing ConventionM MT methods provide multiple translation candidates but no information to use in selecting among them  , or else just the first possible sentence that is generated  . 
On the contrary , EBMT generates all the possible candidates combining suitable phrases  . It also provides proper scores to each candidate using a similarity calculation  . The scores realize " deterministic " translation . 
3 . 3  . 4 Speed \[ Furuse96\] has improved a matching mechanism over translation patterns  . By accepting input in left-to-right order and dealing with best-only substructures  , the explosion of structural ambiguity is restrained and an efficien translation of a lengthy input sentence can be achieved  , l ) re-liminary experimentation has shown that average translation times are reduced from  1  . 15 seconds to 0 . 5 5 seconds for input of 10 words in length and from 10  . 87 seconds to 2 . 04 seconds for input of 20 words in length . The incorporation of incremental morphological analysis and generation \[  Akamine95\] into the new-version TDMT , is promising for achieving incremental ( simultaneous ) translation for a practical spoken-language translation system  . 
If instantaneous response is required , the rest dominant process is retrieval of the closes transla-tion patterns from bulk collection  . It is effectively solved by using a massively parallel algorithms and machines\[  Sumita95-a   , Snmita95-b , Oi 93\] . 
3.3.5 Quality
First , a wellknown difficult problem in Japanese to English translation was selected as a test  . The Japanese noun phrase of the form " noun+NO + noun " using the Japanese adnom-inM particle " NO " is an expression whose meaning is continuous  . A translation success rate of about 80% has been demonstrated in a Jacknife test\[ Sumita92-a  \] . Also , for other Japanese and English phrases , similar effectiveness in target word selection and structurald si ambiguation has been  demonstrated\[Sumita92-b\]  . 
We have evaluated a experimental TDMT system , with 825 model sentences about conference registration . These sentences cover basic expressions in an inquiry dialogue  . The success rate is 71% for a test dataset consisting of 1  , 050 unseen sentences in the same domain . 
1 075 target : " T would like to arrive at L as Vegasby nineo ' clock at night " target : " If you get on the busat nine fifteen  , you ~ llarrive bye ~ hto'clock at night " source : " A B ~- CT ~" target : " A teight  0' clock 2" source : " L ; ~~ f ~ , ~? : ~~ d--~r . '\] ff~;0~7~AT~-n " target : " Well , it takes eleven hours approximately , r ~ ht ? " source : % ~ ~ , ~' ~ U ~-~' 6-i--~l % " ffl\[;b ~ U ~-" target:"No . there is the time difference and it will take t ~ elve hours " Figure  1: JE translation snapshot by TDMT source : " C - ~% T ' ~ P e ~  , gtCZS f ~'8~9-~~'' ( Hi is it possible to make hotel reservation from here ?  ) target:"~1~~~~++~@~1~?" source:"C~fr ( ~- C'~/~-c~'C - ~ ,   , ~a)ZI at ~* ~ Z~X-c'I ~ bT~~:~i ~ ~" ( OK , what we do is to give you all the ~ nformation you need and then ~ eask youtogoahead and make the cally our self  . ) target : ~ , ~7 ~ ul\]o ~ o ~ ~ ~ o ~ ~ ~ ~ x\]~?~ . \]~h"source:"b+~U~d~69~JU~/~U~<tZ ~" ( OLl'm looking for a central locatioi ~ if possible  . ) target : " ~ L ~ ~ ~\] ~ ~ J ~ ~ ~ j j ~\] ~ . .
( Not too expensive , and it shouldn~t take too long to get to the major sights from there  .   ) target : " e~H17~ ~ HI~I ~ ~ ~ l ~ ~17~ ~ gJL " Figure 2: JK translation snapshot by TDMT 4 JE 8? JK prototype systems The TDMT system is being expanded so as to handle travel arrangement dialogues including the topics of hotel reservation  , room services , troubles hooting during hotel stays , various information queries , and various travel arrangements . At present the JE system has about a 5 , 0 00-word vocabulary and a transfer knowledge from 2  , 000 training sentences . The JK system is half this size . While some modules , such as morphological analysis and generation , are language-specific , the transfer module is a common part of every language pair  . Through JE and JK implementation , we believe that the translation of every language pair can be achieved in the same framework using TDMT  . On the other hand , it has turned out that the linguistic distance between source and target languages reflects the variety of target expression patterns in the transfer knowledge  . Table 1 shows the number of target expression patterns corresponding a Japanese particles in JE and JK  . These numbers are counted from the current TDMT sys-tem's transfer knowledge  , and the numbers of examples are token numbers ( i . e . , not including du-plications ) . 
5 Discussion 5 . 1 In tegrat ion of Speech and Language A mechanism for spontaneous speech translation must be consistent with a mechanism for handling associative knowledge  , such as translation usage examples and word cooccurrence information for rnemory-b~ed processing  , and with a mechanism for logical structure analysis according to detailed rules for each processing phase in the Transfer-Driven MT processing  . Under the process , a study should be carried out on building a stochastic language model using both syntactic and semantic information for speech understanding  . 
5.2 Related Research
On the other hand , some studies hope to build spoken language translation systems using a certain interlingua method  . A semantic parser is a typical example of this method  . In particular , " semantic pattern based parsing " in JANUS , CMU's speech to speech translation system\[ Woszczyna93  ,   Levin95\] uses framebased semantics with a semantic phrase grammar and the operation of the parser is viewed as " phrase spotting  . " Another one is MIT's multilingual

The system makes use of ' semantic frame representation ' so as to paraphrase are cognized speech input utterance into a concrete and simple expression that contbrms with one of the system's internal representations and makes the utterance meaning easy to handle  . I to we ver , in extracting the meaning of an inlmt sentence , many default values are required so as to execute heuristic inferences  . The inference is too powerful in explaining a speaker's intention and the propositional content of the utterance by one keyword or phrase  . Such a method may work well in a certain domain , but less scalability may be revealed when making a larger prototype system  . 
VERBMOBIL is a typical translation system for face -to:face dialogue\[  Wahlster93\]  . This system adopts English as a dialogue language for humanmachine interface and makes use of DRT -based semantic representation uits  . 
6 Conc lus ion '\[' DMT has been proposed as a general technique for spoken-language translation  . We have applied TDMT to two language pairs , i . e . , JapaneseEnglish , and Japanese-Korean , as a first step toward multilingual translation . Also , we are planning to integrate speech recognition with TI  ) M'F for achieving effective and efficient speech translation  .
