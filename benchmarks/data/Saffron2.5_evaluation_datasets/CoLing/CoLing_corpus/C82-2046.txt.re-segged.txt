NJ alsgade 96 , DK-2300K ~ benhavn S , De:m ~ ark This paper is based on work done Join tly by Hanne Ruus  , Eh be Spang-Hanssen and the author , all of the University of Copen~hagen . The work was done within the framework of EUROTRA and sponsored by the Commission of the European Community  . Work on this paper was begun whilst the author was at ISSCO  , 
Geneva.
Throughout this paper we shall imagine a machine translation system which performs the following : correct analysis of source language  , correct structure of target language sent-ence , correct choice of words in the target language . In this enviro ~ . entwesh all discuss some aspects of the problem of constructing the correct fini teverbal form  . The languages in-volved are the languages of the European Community  . It is obvious that it is not possible simply to use the " same " morphological form in the target language as in the source language : verbal tenses are not the same in all languages  ( not even in languages as closely related as those considered  ) and even where the same tenses exist they do not necessarily have the same distribution  . So a mapping has to be defined . 
ASEUROTRA is in its conception multilingual this mapping should not be defined on a binary basis  ( between pairs of languages )  , but should rather consist in a definition of some basic and global interpretations of the morphology of verbs in the languages considered  . 

The study can . not be restricted to morphology proper . 
Meanings that are expressed morphologically ( by auxiliaries or flexives ) in one language might be expressed lexically ( by the use of particular lexical units ) in other languages . As an example ~ take the progressive aspect in English : En  . they are ~ it_~_i ~_ n ~ - ~ Fr . ils4 crivent/ils@ontentraind ' 4 crire , --~--~ Danish desk Tiver/desid dercgs kriver /deer if ~ rd we dat ~ krlve  . l . e . the progressive aspect which is expressed in English by morphological mesns  , is in French and Danish either not expressed or expressed by certain lexical units  . 
It is very important to realize the impact of this  , There is often a tendency to think that in the analysis of language a borderline can be drawn between morphological information and lexioal information  . This is true to slarge extent when only one language is considered  , but it is certainly not true in a multilingual environment  . Roughly speaking , the system should take into account all pieces of information which can be expressed morphologically in at least one language  . 
The propose ~ e . yet em for the representation of verbal forms . 
The system as such will contain the global information  , i . e . the information which has to be transferred to other languages  . In this paper only the transfer of active finite verb forms with respect to tense will be considered  , i . e . 
modality , voice , etc . is not taken into account . 
Apart from this global information the system can for each language be expanded with all kinds of local information which is useful for analysis or for generation  . Some morphological phenomena are only grammatically bound and do not carry any semantic meaning that should be coded for the use of other languages  , e . g . the use of the subjonct if in French subordinate clauses following llfaut que  . Information about this subjonct if can be regarded as internal to French and should not be expressed in the global system  . 
The variables proposed to describe the semantic content of tense and aspect are the following  ( Note that tens_ . ._ee is - 191 - used in a very genera l meaning . Tense is determined by values of time and aspect  . It should also be noted that the use of the concepts aspect and Aktion sart has been de ? in dd with respect to the languages involved and consequently is not necessarily the tradi tion alone  ) : TENSE :: s ( AXIS , PROSPECTIVE , RETROSPECTIVE , ASPECT , 
AKTIONSART )

RETROSPECTIVE : := RE~RO-IRETRO+~CONTINUOUS I """ ASPECT::  . nul . _ . ~l ~ EMPHATICPROGRESSIVE AKTIONSART : := DURATIVE ~ NON-DURATIVE Suggestions of other values  ( for English , for the examples below ) : AKTIONSART : := DYNAMIC ~ STATIVE or perhaps rather ACTIVITY VERB~PROCES SVERBI TRANSITIONAL 
EVENT VERB
For adverbs a value TIME WI~lq.
In the paper the use of the variables and the i r values will be explained  . Here only a few remarks can be made . 
1 . The system is viewed as operating in all languages on two time axes  , one for the tenses that are anchored in the present  , and a parallel one for the tenses that are anchored in the past  ( NUNC and TUNC , respectively ) ,  2 . The RETROSPECTIVE value CONTINUOUS is used for events that are still going on : F ~  . il demeure la depui ~ unmois endEn . He has l ~ . ved there for " a month will get the same values :  ( I~NC , PROSPECT- , CONTINUOUS , null , DURATIVE ) . 
3 . More values for the RETROSPECTIVE variable i stobe for e seen  . 
4 . In English it is not possible to have the prefect tense with an adverbial of the type TIME WHEN  . So a rule of the generation ~ smmar of English will say that  ( ~ UNC , PROSPECT- , RETRO + . ., . .) + T I~WHEH -~ ( TUNC , PROSPECT -, RETRO -, . ., . .) 5 . Certain verbs in English tend to prefer the progressive -  192 -aspect . Consequently the AKTIONSART must be expanded as to be able to express these facts : A simulation of the system made on some Community texts shows good results  . 
A text is shown in the apped nixAn French ( source ) and in English . Both versions are official Community texts . For each verbal form which is finite in French and has a finite equivalent in English is shown how the system works  .

However it is possible to choose both translations from the French original  . 
Note furthermore , that tombe_ . __~ r in the meaning " decrease " is DURATIVE , while tomber ~ a is NON-DURATIVE ) . 
To our knowledge no other system has been proposed which works for more than one language  . Reichenbach's system is made for English and shows deficiences even for English  . Bruce " s system repairs these deficiences and works for English  , but relies heavily on the structure of English verbal forms and cannot easily be brought to work for other languages as well  . 

The system which we have proposed seems promising , but still a good deal of work is needed to define adequate values for the different variables  .
