We shall be concerned in this paper with the logical analysis of natural language on the basis of Lesniewski's ontology  , which is a logical system without type dist inction between individuals and monadic predicates  . This , it is believed , is also one of the features of natural language  , and use will be made of this feature for deve loping a frag-ment of natnral language  . 
I Introduction According to Montague everys imple sentence of natural language is of the fo rm 
Np+Vp=(Det+N ) + Vp , and , as emphasized by Barwise-Cooper \[1\] Det+N constitutes a gen-eralized quanti fier to be applied to Vp or verb phrase as one-place predicate  .   ( For Montague grammar consult among others Montague \  [10  \ ]  , Cress well\[3\] and Jirku\[6\]<)
Thus , simple sentences suck as: . 1 the man walks, . 2 every man walks , ?3 some ( a)men ( man ) walk(s ) . 4 ( at least ) two men walk , ?5 ( at least ) three men walk , are respectively , of the following logical forms : 1 . 11 ( kPkQP1x man ) walk , 1 . 21 (~ P~Q~x(PxOQx ) man ) walk,1 . 31 ( XP % Q3x ( PxAQx ) man ) walk , 1 . ~ l ( kPkQB xB y ( Px^PyAPxAQyAxz~y ) man ) Walk ,  1  . 51  ( kPkQB x~y3z ( PxAQy ~ QxAQyAPz ~ QzAx~yAy~zAz ~x  )   . man ) walk , where QIxPx is the Russellian-type defin ite description to be de-fined as ~ x  ( Px~Qx ) A ~ x ~ t y ( PxAPY . ~ X~ry ), with the scope restricted to Q . 
By means of k-con , ~ ersion , for example , " from 1 . 11 and 1 . 21 we respectively obtain : walk ix man x , and
Vx(manxO walkx ) , so that Det+Nnow becomes in both cases a generalized quantifier  . 
139140 A . ISHIMOTO ( Here as well as in what follows intension wil l not be taken into consideration  . The proposed Lesniewskian theory will there for e be extensional  . ) Now it is to be remembered that 1 . 11-1 . 51 are the formulas of ( second-order ) predicate logic . In other words , the sentences of natural language are embedded in predicate logic although a large number of formulas of the logic do not have their counterparts in natural language  . 
However , the embedding in traditional predicate logic is not necessarily the only possible way for us to understand the logical st ructure of natural language  . In fact , natural language could also be embedded in Lesn iewski's ontology augmented by a number of add-itional notions so that a fragment of natural language can be accomodated there  , and ~ n what follows we shall be concerned with a detailed construction of Lesniewskian- type logical grammar  . 
2 Logica l ~ rammar based upon Lesn iewsk i1~ ontology In Lesniew-skian-type Montague grammar we are all the same starting from the structural assumption of the simple sentences of natural language as mentioned at the beginn ing of the last section  . Neverthel@ss , in Lesniewskian version of logical grammar , which will be abbre-viated as LMG in the sequel  , Det , i . e . determiners , are represented not by generalized quant if iers but by the functors of Lesniewski's onto logy with noun and intransitive verb phrases to be combined thereby as two arguments  , which are now provided with the category of names in the sense of Lesniewski's onto logy  , not the one corresponding to monadic predicates of predicate logic  . 
Without going into the details of the phrases t ructure and transformational rules necessary for generating a fragment of Eng-lish  ( which is by far smaller than that proposed by Cooper-Parsons  \[2\]   ) we shall present the deep or logical structures of a number of simple sentences  ( of English ) as ( well-formed ) sentences belonging to the proposed Lesniewsk ianversion of Montague grammar to be de-~s ignated as LMG :  2  . 11 (( the man ) walk ), 2 . 12 (( every (( manor ) woman )) speak ), 2 . 13 (( somewoman ) not play )), 2 . 14 (( every man )\ [ love ( some woman )\]) 2 . 15  ( the woman )  \[ ( love and ) admire )  \] '  ( every ( boy ( or girl ) \] l )  2 . 16 ( not (( every man ) speak )) , where \[\] l is a combinator or operator which makes an intransitive verb phrase out of at ransitive verb and a noun phrase  . This com-binator is represented by a declens ion in inflectional languages such as Slavic ones  , while in the case of uninflected languages such as English it is taken care of by word order  . 
It is remarked that any combinator could some t imes be applied from the left to the right as suggested by Cress well  \[5\] ? This has already been practised in som@of the above sample sentences  . Thus such sentences like: (   ( every man )  \[ ( some ( dog ( or cat ) ) love \] 1 )  , and ( ( some woman )  \[ ( some man ) ( love not ) \] 1  )  , are also well-formed , being close to the word order usual in Japanese . 
As is wellknown , 2 . 1 4 has another deep or logical structure in quantificational theory with ' some ' hav ing the widerscope than ' every '  . In this case , the given sentence is of the form : (  \[ ( every man ) love\]2 ( somewoman ) )  , ALESNIE WSKIAN VERSION OF MON TAGUEG RMMAR 141 where \ [ !2 combines a noun phrase and a transitive verb phrase giving rlse to an expression corresponding to amonadic predicate  . 
But , unlike\[\]l , the dounphrase to be combined is in the nominative case  . 
The use of \[ \]2 will be illustrated as follows: 2  . 21 (\[( some man ) hate\]2 ( every woman )), 2 . 22 (( every woman )\[( some man ) hate\]2) , which are of the same structure with each other with ' some man'remaining the subject of these sentences  . 
Asfs easily understood from the development up to the present  , the ( well-formed ) expressions of the proposed LMG as a logic are de -fined in terms of the expressions both constant nnd variable having the category of names in the sense of Lesniewski's ontology and re-lations as well as of a number of logical operators not only sentential and quantificational but also name-for ~ ing and relation-#orm-ing  .   ( For Lesniewski's ontology consult I wanus\[5\] , Luschei\[9\] and Slupecki\[11\] . ) 3Axiomatization of LMG as a logic ; w ~ If we are to develop LMG as a logic , we have to axiomatize it as a logical system . 
Fortunately the axiomatization of Lesniewski ' sontology has been intensively worked out ever since its single axiom was first proposed by Lesniewski himself in  1921  . 
Thus , we are starting with the celebrated single axiomorigi-nating from Lesniewski :  3  . 01 e(a , b ) ~ . (3x)e(x , a ) ~( x ) ( ~( x , a)O~(x , b )) A(x)(y)(C(x , a ) A ? ( y , a ) . OE(x , y )) , or its simplified version by So boe in ski \ [19  :  3  . o2 ~( a , b ) ~( ~ x )( ~( x , a)^E(x , b ))( x)(y)(~(x , a ) A ~( y , a ) . D ~( x , y )) , where est and s for ' the ' and a , b ,  . . . and ~ helike are ( meta- ) logical variables ranging over the expressions of the category of Les-niewskian names  . On the other hand , e(a , b ) stands for ( ( ea ) b ) or ( ( a e ) b ) or ( b ( e a ) ) or ( b ( ae ) ) , which are forthcoming as a result of the libera lization due to Cress well  \[3\]  . Analogously , A(a , b ) ( l(a , b )) represents (( Aa ) b ) etc . (( I a ) b ~ etc . ) with A ( I ) taking the place of ' every ' ( ' some ' )  .   ( A and I are also known as syllogistic funetors corresponding to ' every ' and ' some ' respect ively  . ) Nevertheless , 3 . 01 or 3 . 02 is not enough to develop LMG as a language . In fact , we need a number of additional axiom ( schemata ) for taking care of name-and relation - forming  ( logical ) operators and the expressions involving \[ \]1 and \[ \]2  . 
The axiom ( schemata ) stipulating these operators are well-known , being of the forms : 3 . 11 e(a , b and c ) 5 . E(a , b ) Ae(a , c ), 3 . 12 e(a , bore ) ~ . c(a , b ) Ve(a , c ), 3 . 21 e(a , not b ) ~ . e(a , a)A ~ e(a , b ), 3 . 22 ( R and S )( a , b ) ~ . R(a , b)AS(a , b ), 3 . 23 ( R or S )( a , b ) ~ . R(a , b)VS(a , b ), 3 . 24 not R(a , b ) ~ . e(a , a ) Ae(b , b)A ~ R(a , b ), 3 . 25 enR(a , b ) ~ R(b , a ) 3 . 26 R(a , b ) ~ . e(a , a ) Ag(b , b ), where in 3 . 26 R is atomic . We are also abbreviating such expres-142 A . ISHIMOTOsions as ( ( R and ) S ) and the like as ( R and S ) for the purpose of per-spicuity . 
Lemma 3.3 3.25 holds of any relation R.
This is easily proved on the basis of 3 . 23-3  . 24 by induction on the length of the given R . 
3 . ~1A(a , h ) ~( x ) ( c(x , a ) D ~( x , h ), 3 . h2I(a , b ) ~ ~ x)(e(x , a ) ~ e(x , b)) . 
We are now presenting some of the axiom ( schemata )   , which take care of the expressions containing  \[ \]   1 and\[\] 2  . 
3 . 51 e(a ,\ ( eb)R\]1 . (Bx )( g(x , a)A(3z )( ?( z , b)AR(x , z )) A(x )( y ) ( ~( x , a ) ^ E(y , a ) . O ~( x , y ))^( x)(y)(E(x , b )^ ~( y , b) . O ~( x,Y ) 3 . 52 A(a , \[( Ib ) R\]1(x ) ( s(x , a)O(BY)(e(y , b ) % R(x , y )) 3 . 53 l(b , \[( Aa)R\]2) (3y ) (~( y , b)A(x ) ( ~( x , a ) OR(x , y ) ) It is not i ced that some of these ax ioms are not well-formed as sentences of LMG as a language although they belong to LMG qualog ic  . 
Theorem 3 . 7E very simple sentence of LMG ( as a language ) is equivalent to a sentence ( of LMG as a logic )   , and this sentence in-volve only g and atomic relations besides logical operators with quantifiers binding only such name variab lesx and y as occur there in the context e  ( x , a ) or R(x , y ) . 
The proof is carried out by induction on the number of symbols other than those mentioned in the theorem on the basis of axioms  . 
It is again observed that the formulas to which these sentences of natural language are trans formed are not necessarily those belonging to LMG as a language  . 
4 T rans la t ion of LMG into pred icate log ic It will be shown in this section that LMG as a language is embedded in first-order pred icate logic  ( with equality ) via a translation T to be defined present ly  .   ( The proposed translation dates from Prior \[8\] and has been elaborated by Ishimoto \[4\] and Kobayashi-Ishimoto \[7\]  . ) The t rans la t ion T is de f ined by induct ion on the number of the words contained in the g iven expression of LMG  . 
In the first place , the basis is taken care of by:
Ta = Fa,
Tb = Fb , where a , b, .   .   . are ( atomic ) names constant and variable , and Fa , Fb ,   . . . are monadic predicates again constant or var iable corresponding to a  , b ,   .   .   . not necessarily exhausting all of them . 
Te = IPIQQlxPx ,
TA = IPIQ~x(PxOQx),
TI = IPIQBx(PxAQx).
We are now proceeding to the induction steps :
TaA8=TaAT8,
Tav8=TaVT 8,
TaDS = TeDT 8,
T ~= ~ T ~ ,
T ( x)a = VF xTG ,
T ( Bx ) a = BF x T a , where e , ~ . . . . are meta - log ica l var iab les rang ing over the ALESNIEWSKIAN VERSION OF MONT A GUEGRAMMAR  143 sentences of LMG . 
Before " taking up the translation of relat ions  , i . e . transitive verbs we have to introduce in advance another translation T  1 which transforms every relation in LMG into a  ( binary ) relation of pre-dicate logic . The translation T 1 is defined inductively on the number of the relation-forming operators employed for de fining the given one  . 
Starting with the basis :
T1R = IxlYGR(X , y ) , where GR is the ( binary ) relation ( of the Dredicate logic ) corres-ponding to the give atomic relat ion of LMG  , induction steps are : T1H and S = Ixly ( TlR ( x , y ) AT , S(x , y )) , TIE or S = Ixly(TiR(x , y ) ~ T , S(x , y )) , 
T1 not R = Ixly ~ TlR(x , y),
T1 enE = IxlyTiR(y , x ) ( T1R and Setc . will be abbreviated as Go . ~, etc .   ) On the basis of the translatz on T 1 thus introduced , T is de-fined for any relation R of LMG as fo llows : 
TR = IPIQT1R(IxPx , IxQx ) , with R(IxPx , IxQx ) being defined as : ~ xB y ( Px^Qy  ~ R ( x , y )) ~ VxVy(Px^Py . Ox = y)^~xVy(Qx^Qy . Ox = y) . 
Lastly the translation T is applied to the operators\[\]i : and\[\  ]2 in the following vay ~ T\[\]i = ~ VIW lx ( Vly W ( x , y )) , 
T\[\]2 = ~ V ~ W ~ y(V ~ xW(x , y )) , where V and W are respectively the variables of the type of noun phrases and  ( binary ) relations in predicate logic . 
Availing ourselves of the translation T thus defined  , some sample sentences ( of LMG ) will be translated into the corresponding sentences of predicate logic  . 
4  . 11 T 2 . 11 = T ( ( the man ) walk ) = T ( ( e man ) walk )  =  ( ( T e T man ) Twalk )  =  ( IPIQQIxP x ) Fman ) Fwalk = Fwalkl X Fman X ,  4  . 14 T 2 . 14 = T (   ( every man ) \[ love ( somewoman ) \] l )  =  ( IPIQ~x ( PxDQx ) Fman )   (   ( ~ VIWIx ( VI yW ( x , y  ~ ( IPIQ~x ( pxAQ x ) Fwoman ) Glove ) = IQ ~ ( Fman X ~ Qx ) Ix ( IQ~y ( Fwoman YA Qy ) lyGlove ( X , y ) )  ~ X ( Fman XO BY ( Fwoman YAG love ( X ' Y )   )   ) " As has been exemplified by the above trans lations we easily obtain : Lemma ~  . 3 Every sentence of LMG as a language is t rans la ted by T into a formula of first-order predicate logic with equality  . 
Lemmah . 4 The t rans la t ion of the theses of LMG as a log ic are provab le in pred icate logic  . 
The proof is carried out by induction on the length of the proof  . 
The treatment of the basis will be illust rated by the following example :  4  . ~ iT3 . 02 ~ : T ~( a , b ) ~ . (Bx )( ~( x , a ) ~ ~( x , h ))( x)(y)(c(x , a )^ ~( x , b ) . DE(x , y )) : : F blXF a X ~ . ~ Fx ( Fal X F x x ~ F b l X F x X ) ~ VF x ~ F y ( F a ! x F x x A F al x F y X . ~ FylxFxx ) : : F blXF a ~? ~ x ( Fax ~ FbX ) ~~ x Vy ( Fax ~ Fay . ~ x = y ) . 
144 A . ISHIMOTO
Here use is ~ made of some these so ~ second-o~der predicate logic  . 
All the other axioms , if translated by T , will turn our to be provable in ( higher-order ) predicate logic . The induction steps do not present any diff iculties  . 
In view of Lemmas ~ . 3 and h . h we obtain , Corollary h . 5 If a sentence of LMG as language is a thesis of LMG as a logic  , then its T-transform is provable in first- order predicate logic with equality  . 
It is remarked that the proof of the T-t rans form of a sentence belonging to LMG as a language might involve formulas not necessa-ri ly belonging to first-order predicate logic  . 
Lastly we wish to state without proof a lemma of fundamental importance  , namely , Lemmah . 6 If the T - t ransform of a sentence be long ing to LMG as a language is provable in first- order predicate logic with equality  , then the sentence is a thesis of LMG as a logic . 
This is proved syntactically as well as semant ically by the method employed in Ishimoto  \[4\]  . 
Combining Corollary ~ . 5 and Lemmah . 6 we obtain , ~ L Theorem ~ . 7 For every sentence ~ of LMC as a language MG e iff T ~ is a thesis of first-order predicate logic with equal-ty  . 
In view of theorem h . 7 as far as the logical der ivabi l i ty of some sentences of natural language as specified above is concerned  , there is no difference between first-o rder predicate logic and Les-niewski's ontology  . Use will be made , it is hoped , of this fact in the various fields ; elated to the logical analysis of natural language  .
