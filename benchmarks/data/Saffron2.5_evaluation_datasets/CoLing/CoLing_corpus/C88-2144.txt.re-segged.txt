This papuaples el~ts a framework to t the modebfl ~ eoletic analysis of tense and aspect on ns in diseoms e  . It has been developed for Eurot ~' a , the MT project of the Europeau Community , and has been applied to the nine Eurotra languages : English  , German , Dutch , Danish , Greek , Italian , 
French , Spanish and Portuguese.
The paper censis ~ s of six parts . The first presents the problem of translating tense and aspect forms and indicates the type of solution I envisage  . The second contains a formalism fortile . representation f time meanings . The third and the fourth present a theory of tense and aspect respectively  . 
The fifth discusses the issue of compositionality and the six this at  ; out the use of the system in the Eurotra framework . 
1. THE PROBLEM
It is a facL of language that the number and the use of the tense and aspect forms are different for every language  . 
Even for closely related languages the differences teld to be large  . As a consequence , it is not possible to state one-to-one conespondences between the tense and aspect forms of different languages  . Some exanlples : EN he has lived in London for 20 years ( presemperfect ) 
FR . ilvit ~ tLondres depu is 20 aus ( simple present ) 
EN he has been watching TV for hours ( pl~esent perfect progressive ) PRilaregard 6 lat 616 pendant desheures ( pl~esent perfect ) Differenccg like these pose nontrivial problems for machine translation  .

Because of Eurotra's policy to keep the bilingual transfer components as small and simple as possible it has been decided tc  , pursue the interlingual approach . 
The resulting system is based on htsighls from- interval semantics  ( cf . Bennett , Partee , Dowty , Bruce ) -the Reicheubachian analysis of tense and aspect in terms of time of speech  , time of reference and time of event ( cf . Reichenbach , Johr ~ von , Smith)-discourse representation theory ( of . Kamp , Rohrer , Partee ) - descriptive typological studies ( cf . Comrie ) 2 . THEFORMALISM As a starting point I take the temporal structure < T  , < , ca > , where T is a set of intervals , < is a binary relation that linearly orders time ( precedence )  , and n is a binary operation on intervals ( intersection )  . 
An interval is a continuou subpart of the time line  ( a )  . It may consist of one single moment of time ( b ) , but it cannot contain any gaps ( c):
II(a ) .   .   .   .   .   .   .   . ~( h ) .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .  *  .   .   .   .   . ~( c)---~=--a--~:: . -~-> The intersection of two intervals is that subpart of the intervals which they have in common : 
IJ
In J
Given the temporal structure < T , < , n > , the number of possible relations between intervals can be determined in a principled way : for any ordered pair of intervals  ( I and J )  , it will be the case that either I caJ = O and then <  ( l , J ) or > ( I , J)
I--~-~--~(preceed)

These are the seven logically possible relations between ordered pairs of intervals on a one -dimensional timeline  . 
For the analysis of single isolated clauses I will nse the Reichenbachia notions of time of speech  , time of reference and time of event . The time of event ( E ) is tile interval for which a basic tense less proposition is said to be true  , and the function of the tense and aspect forms is to define the relation between that interval and the time of speech  ( S ) via the intermediary time of reference ( R . ) . 
For the analysis of clauses in context I make use of a generalised model  ( cf .  3 . 4 . ) . 
3 . ATHEORYOFTENSE 3 . 1 . file tense meanings Tense meanings will be defined as relations between a time of reference and a time of speech : Rel  ( R , S) . 
The number of possible tense meanings is , hence , equal to the number of possible relations between R and S  , which is seven ( cf .  2 . ) . However , since the time of speech is generally conceived to be a moment of time rather than an interval of some length  , some of these relations carmot hold in principle . The overlap-relations (<< and >>) , for instance , can tufty obtain between two intervals of a certain length  , and the proper part of relation ( c ) cannot hold between R and Seither , for if S is one moment of time , R can only be a proper part of S if it is smaller than a moment  , which is impossible . 
Furthermore , there seems to be no linguistic evidence lot making a distinction between proper inclusion  ( w ) and identity ( = )  , since " . . . languages do not have distinct grammatioeal categories of tense indicating location in time at a par-  . 
ticular point vs . location in time surrounding a particular point . "\[ Comrie 1985 , 123\]As a consequence , the number of possible relations between R and S can be reduced to the following three : <  ( R , S ) = anteriority >( R , S ) = posteriority ~( R , S ) = simultaneity These COl Tespond to the traditional concepts of Past  , Future and Present . Notice , however , that the latter is not defined in terms of identity  , but in terms of improper inclusion . 
The language specific forms for the expl~ession of these concepts are the tense forms and the time adverbials  . 
3.2. tire deictic time adverbials
Typical examples of deictic time adverbials are " now "  , " tomorrow " , and " two weeks ago " . Their function is to relate the time of ~ eference to the time of speech  . Depending on the kind of relation they express they can be charactefised as simultaneous : now  . . . 
anterior : yesterday , two weeks ago ...
posterior : tomorrow , next summer ...
730 3.3. the tense forms
In contrast to the tense meanings which are language independent he tense forms are langnage specilic  . Their number , names and distribution differ from language to language  . 
Ash ~ r the Eumtra languages there seem to be two type ~ oftel Jsef on n systems : the one of the Romance langllages v ~ M the one of the Germanic languages and Greek  . 
An example of the latter type is English : tense form --~\[+/  . -ED\](will+infinitiw ;) yielding\[-ED\]~ , = lh~esent play\[+ED\] f3 = Past played\[uED\]will=:Future will play \[+ ED\]will = Condilion ~ would play There is a bound morpheme  \[+/4~:D \] and an option a lauxili--ary " will " . The latter can " also have a modal meaning , especially in its past tense lonn , bnt in this context I will only discuss its temporal meaning  . 
An examt fle of the former type is French : tense fo ~ m - - ~\ [\ [+ / -  R\]\[+/-AIS\]\]Pass6 yielding i-R\]\[-AIS\]= Pr6sent joue\[+R\]\[-AIS\]=Fnturjoueraii-R\]\ [+ AIS\]=Impar fait jouais\[+R\]\[+AIS\]= Conditionnel jouela is 
Pass 6= Pass ~ jouai
In this system the tense forms are combinations of bound moq  ) heines ; there are no anxiliaries involved . 
As for the meanings of the tense forms they will be defined as elements of the power set of possible tense meanings  . This power set contains eight elements : ~ ,  <) ,  >) ,  (~ ,  < , >1 ,  (< , _~ ,  (> , ~ l ,  1< , > , ~) . 
Not all of these combinations can be assigned to particular lense forms  , though , for there are a few general constraints . 
Bernard Comrieh as argued , lbrinstance , that " in a tense system , the time reference of each tense is a continuity "\[ Comrie  1985  ,  50\] . This implies that there can be no tense lbm~s which can express posteriority and anteriority without expressing simultaneity as welt  . The combination ante , post can , hence , be discarded a priori . For the Eurotral anguages this rest ficition appears to hold  . 
A second restricition concernstile combinatiotts ante  , simnland post , simul . The former is a possible me , ' ming in languages which make a basic distinction between Future  ( post ) and non-Fut~e ( ante , simul ) ; the latter is a possible meaning in languages which make a basic distinction between Past  ( ante ) and non-Past ( post , simul ) . Since a h'm guage cam ~ ot belong to both types at the same time  , it follows that for any given langnage either file contbination post  , simulor the combination ante , simld is rnl ~ out . 
As far as the Enrotral anguages are concerned , they all belong to the latter type . 
In older to find out wt fieh of tiles ix remaining combina  . 
tions can he assigned to file tense forms one can makense of a grammatie  , ' dityest : a tense from X can have a meaning Y ( where Y is any of simultaneous , anterior , posterior ) , if and only if it can be combined with a deictic adverbial of type Y  . 
The application of this test to English the following results : 
Er~glish : and French yields
French :
Present-4 post , simul
Past ~- ~ ~ nte
Future ~ post
Conditional ~- ~0
PrEsent ~ post , simul
Futur ~ postlm parfalt -- ~ ante
Condifionnel--~0
Pas~--oante
The conditional tenses get the value O since they do not have a temporal meaning in single isolated clauses  ( cf . 

3.4. a discourse model
The model presented so far is useftd for the analysis of isolated clauses  . For tl ~ eanalysis of texts we need an extension , or rather a generalisation of the original model . 
The main extensions concern the introduction of another kind of interval  , the point of perspective P ( the term is bon~wed from \[ Rohrer 1985\] )  , and the addition of indices to the intervals . 
Instead of defining the time of reference with respect o the time of speech I will now define its position with respect to the point of perspective  . For any clansei which is part of a discourse , there will be one peint of perspective Pi and one time of reference Ri  . If the clause is the lirst main clause of the discourse  , then its point of perspective is derived from the time of speech  . In other cases the point of perstx ~' ctive will be  , derived fl ~ mtile time of reference of a dominating or preceding clause  . 
An example:
R0ANCHORINGTENSE(1) V sheR1 promised that ~- ~ . . . . . . pie - . --) V(PI , R0) & <( RI , I'1) she would VR2 come on __ ,  . . . ~7~  . . . . . . --_) V(P2,R1) & >( R2,P2)
Monday P2 VR2 = Monday but sheR3 ln medup . . . . . . . . . .  . . . i7z3__~V(P3 , R2) &>( R3 , P3 ) 2 days P3 R3=Wednesday later The notation " V ( Pi , Rjy means that Pi is derived from Rj . 
The interval Rj from wl fich the pesition of Pi is derived will be called the temporal antecedent of the clause with point of perspective Pi  . In the example the temporal antecedent of the third clause is " Monday "  ( R2 )  , the temporal antecedent of the second clause is the time of her promising  ( R1 )  , and the temporal antecedent of the first clause is the lime of speech  ( R0 = S )  . 
Notice that file temporal antecedent of a clause i need not always be the time of reference of the immediately preceding clau  , ~: e(Ri1) . In the sequence ( 2 ) she promised that she would come on Monday , but then she changed hermind the temporal antecedent Of the third clause is the thne of her prondsing  ( R1 ) rather than " Monday " , and in ( 3 ) she promised that she would come on Monday , but now it seems that she cannot the temporal antecedent of the third clause is the time of speech : " now " refers back to the time of speech directly  . 
The differences between the discourse model and the original temporal model are minor : the tense meanings are now relations between Ri and Pi  ( instead of between R and S ) but , since Pi is always a moment of lime ( just like S )  , the number of possible tense meanings remains the same  . The expressive power of the tormalism , however , has been enhanced considerably . It now provides a formalism l br the temporal analysis of all types of clauses - whether enrbedded or not  , whether isolated or in context-and for the description of anaphoric temporal expressions  . The latter will be discussed in the next paragraphs  . 
3.5. the anaphorie time adverbials
There is a class of adverbials which do not refer to the time of speech  , as the deictie ones , but rather to the time of relerence of a dominating or preceding clause  . They can also be grouped in the three subclasses simultan : the same time  , at that moment . . . 
anterior : two weeks before , previously ...
posterior : one week later , then ...
Together with the deictic adverbials they form the class of relational time adverbials  . 
For completeness sake I ' also mention the locational time adverbials  , such as " at2o'clock " , " on Monday " and " in the summer " . They do not express any relational information and can  , therefore , be combined with all possible tcoses . 
Common to both the relational and the locational time adverbials is that they can be used as  , answers to " when "- questions . In this respect they differ from the a . '; pectual adverbials ( cf .  4 . 3 . ) . 
3.6. anaphoric tenses
The use of the tense forms in texts is somewhat different from their use in single isolated clauses  . This is due to the fact that in anterior contexts the present is often replaced by file past and the future by the conditional  . This phenomenon , which is called transposition ( of . Rohrer 1985) , can be seen at work in the following sentences : ( 4 ) he said that he was ill ( 5 ) he entered the room and fell on his face In ( 4 ) t be time of Ir is being ill is simultaneous with his saying that he is ill  , and in ( 5 ) the time of his falling on his face is posterior to the time of his entering the room  . 
In both cases one would expect a present tense in the second clause  , bnt since the first clause is in the past , tran-sposition applies and results in the use of the past tense  . 
T fie discourse diagrams for these sentences look as follows:  ( 4 ) '! V he said R1 that .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   . 1 - - ~ he was iU ~ . . . . .  -~

ANCHORINGTENSE
V(PI,RO)&<(R1,P1)
V(P2, R1) & ~( R2, P2)
R0 = S(5) V ~ he entered R1 the room -~-- .   .   .   .   .   .   . P1 and fell on his R2 face . . . . .  , . . . m = -= t_ . __~

V(P1, R0) & <( RI , P1)
V(P2, R1) &>( R2, P2)
Similar remarks can be made about the use of the conditional in  ( 6 ) we all hoped that he would so on recover From the point of view of analysis there are at least two ways of dealing witb the phenomenon of transposition : it can be treated as a syntactic transformation rasan irregularity in the relation between form and meaning  . In the former case one first maps the past on the present and the conditional on the future and then applies the normal rules for the assignment of meanings  . In the latter case one defines extra rules for the assignment of meanings to the past and the conditional tenses  . 
The former alternative is more constrained than the latter and  , hence , more attractive , but the choice for the one or the other might turn out to be language dependent  . 
4 . ATHEORYOFASPECT 4 . 1 . the aspect meahings There is a considerable confusion in the literature about the definition of aspect  . This is largely due to the fact that many authors do not make a distinction between grammatical aspect and lexical aspect  . The former concerns the syntax and semantics of aspectual auxiliaries and adverbials  , whereas the latter concerns the semantics of main verbs and propositions  ( cf . the event/state/process distinction ) . In this paper I will use the term aspect for the former only  . The latter will be called Aktionsart . 
As a general definition of aspect I will adopt the formulation by Marion Johnson : " What Iam proposing concerning the semantiCS of the aspect forms is that they specify the relation between reference time and event time in an utterance  . "\[ Johnson 1981 ,   153\] Starting from this definition of aspect meanings as binary relations between intervals and combining it with the observation that the number of possible binary relations between intervals is seven  ( of .  2 . ) it is possible to predict that there will be seven aspectual relations  . In the following paragraphs I will discuss them in some detail and relate them to the traditional aspectological terminology  . 
A wellknown aspectual distinction is the one between the perfective and the imperfective  . The perfective presents a situation as a single unanalysable whole  , whereas the imperfective looks at a situation from the inside and focusses on the beginning  , ending or continuation of it ( el . Comrie 1976, 34) . 
As formal counterparts of these definitions I propose the relation s =  ( E , R ) and c(E , R ) for the perfective:
RR
EE . . . . . - EEEE ~ - - - ~ - - - ~ - ~
RR
These relations express the intuition that ti ~ time of event  ( E ) is seen as one unanalysable whole from the point of view of the reference time  . The formal definition of the perfective is , hence , ~( E , R) . 
For the imperfoctive I will make a distinction between three types  . If the focus is on the continuation , the aspect is durative . For its representation I use the relation of proper inclusion : D  ( E , R) . 
EE
RR
The situation is clearly looked at from the inside : R is in 

For the two other types of imperfectivity I will make use of the overlap relations : 
EE . ~ F -'272 ~ .   .   . ~  .   . t-Z'YY 77 & L . . . . . .ZZS . T - . q ,
RR >>( E,R ) <<0 ~, R)
In the ease of right overlap the focus is on the beginning of the situation  . This aspect I will call the inchoative . In the case of left overlap the focus is on the end of the situation  . This aspect I will call the terminative . 
Another aspect that is often mentioned in the literature is the socalled perfect  (  #perfective ! )  . In conformity with Reichenbach , Johnson and others I will analyse it in terms of precedence : <  ( E , R ) . I will , however , not use the term " perfect " for it , but rather the term " retrospective " . The reason for this is that the perfect aspect form should be dis-ting nished from the retrospective aspect meaning : the former is syntactic  , the latter is semantic , and the relation between both is not necessarily one-to-one  . 
Finally , there is the inverse of the retrospective , i . e . the prospective :> ( E,R ) . It is one of the meanings of the English " be going to " and of the French auxiliary " aller "  . 
In short , there are six different aspect meanings . Their language specific counterparts are a speetual auxiliaries and adverbials  . 
4.2. the aspectual auxiliaries
As for the Eumtral anguages the aspect form system show a larger diversity than the tense form systems  . 
Some typical aspectual distinctions are the ones between-perfect and non-perfect  ( have+past participle ) -progressive and non-progressive ( be + present participle ) -go and non-gu ( go + to-infinitive ) The first distinction is made in all of the Eumtm languages  , but the two other ones are no teum versal . They are present in English , but not ha German and Danish , for instance , and French has the third distinction , but not the second . 
It may be worth stressing that I will only analyse the aspectaal anxiliaries  . Full lexical verbs , such as " stop " , " start " and " continue " , and periphrastic forms , such as " ~ treen train de " and " venir de " , will not be discussed here . 
l ? brEnglish , the set of aspectual auxiliaries can be defined as follows : aspect 
O?5 have Of ~ behave be
O behave bel ; br French , aspect lonn-- )   ( have+papa )   ( be + prpa ( go + to-int ) ) f ~ = Simple rain
O = Perfect have rained
O = Progressive be mining
O = PerfProgr have been raining go = Gobegoing to rain go = Perfect Go have been going to rain the definition looks as follows : lbrm -->\ [ avoir/~tre+papaaller+inf\] 
O=Simple pleuvoir avoir/~tre=Compostavoir plu aller = Futur prochealler pleuvoir Astor the assignment of meanings to the auxiliaries I will follow the same procedure as for the tense meanings  . The meaning of an aspect form is an element of the power set of possible aspect meanings  . This set contains 64 elements . 
For the dr ; fruition of the mappings one can start from the following euroversal scheme  ( euroversal=common to the nine Eurotra languages  ) : simple-~perfective perfect --> retrospective go ~ in choafive progressive - ~ durativc If one of these tbrms is not present in the language  , its meaning may he expressed by another form . In general this will be the form whose basic meaning is the least distant from the meaning to be expressed  . For a specification of the notion of distance between meanings I will use the following scheme : retmterm perf  , durinch opro < < < . ~  , = 3>>>12345 The distance between two , aspect meanings is equal to the difference of their numbers  . 
it follows frmn the principle of minimal distance that a language without a progressive will express the durative by means of the form which expresses the perfective  ( 13-31=0 )  , i . e . the simple form . This is indeed tree for French,
Dutch , German and Danish.
T be principle also guides the choice of a form for the expression of fileterminative  . Some languages have a special form for this aspect  . English , for instance , has the per-\[izct progrcs sive for this meaning . Most languages , however , do not have such at brm and in those cases the minimal distance principle predicts which forms can be used for the expression of terminativity  , i . e the ( retrospective ) perfect lbrm , the ( perfective ) simple form or the ( durative ) progressive foim:12 . -11 = 12-31 = 1 ( see also 4 . 3 . ) . 
Taking into account he basic scheme and the principle of minimal distance  ,   , and complementing it with language specific observations  , one can derive the following mappings for English and French : 
English :
French :
Simple --> pelf
Perfect--~retro , term
Progressive ~ dur , perf
Perf progr - - ~ term
Go ~ incho , pro
Perfect Go--4O
Simple--~perf , dur , term
Compost ~ retro , tenn
Futur proche ~ in cho , pro 4 . 3 . aspectuald verbials Tile aspectual adverbials include the duration adverbials and the boundary adverbials  . 
The duration adverbial specify the length of the time of event  . Depending on whether the basic proposition is an event or a state/process they are expressed by an  1N-adverbial or a FOR-adverbial : ( 7 ) sher an the mile in five minutt ~ ( 8 ) he has been sleeping for ten hours ( 9 ) we have been in France for a month They do not express any relational information  . 
The boundary adverbials specify the beginning and /or the end of the time of event  . They are prepositional pbrases introduced by " since "  , " from " , " until " , " till " , " from . . till" . 
One of these expresses relational information : the " since "- adverbials denote an interval which begins in the past at some specified time  , e . g . Christmasin " since Chrismlas " . 
The endpoint of such an interval is not specified by the adverbial  , but is normally taken to be included in the time of reference  . The relation between time of event and time of reference will  , hence , be one of overlap :

Xm as R
It t bllows that " since " adverbials express terminativity and that the compatibility of these adverbials with the aspect forms can be used as a test for deciding whether a given aspect form can be terminative  . 
What the aspectual adverbials have in common is that they can be used as answers to " how long " -questions  . This distinguishes them from the time adverbials . 
5. DEGREES OF COMPOSITIONALITY
Tense and aspect forms do not occur in isolation : finite verbs have both a tense form and an aspect form  . The meaning of their combination is the relational product of the meanings of the tense form and the meanings of the aspect form  . An example : the meaning of the English present perfect progressive is the relational product of the meanings of the present tense with the meanings of the perfect progressive aspect  . In other words , the meaning of the present perfect progressive is compositional  . 
Not all combinations of tense and aspect are compositional  , though . In some cases a form can have a meaning which cannot be derive deom positionally  , in other cases a form may lack a meaning which can be derived compositionally  . 

An'example of the former type is the present perfect in languages like French  , Dutch and German . Apart from or even instead of its compositional meanings this form has a n < anterior  , peffective > meaning , i . e . the meaning of the English simple past . This appears a . o . from their compatibility with anterior time adverbials : 
FR jel'aivubier
DU ik be bhem gisteren gezien
G Eichhabei hnge stem gese hen
EN*I have seen him yesterday
Is a whimy esterday
An example of the latter type is the French pass d simple  . 
The simple aspect can have three different meanings in French  , but in combination with the pass g , it can only have the perfective interpretation : the durative and the terminative meaning are expressed by the impar fait  . 
Depending on how many exceptions there are , the tense and aspect system of a given language will be more or less compositional  . In ease of a low degree of compositionality one could decide to assign meanings to combinations of tense and aspect forms  , rather than to tense and aspect forms separately . 
6. THE SYSTEMINUSE
Eurotra is a transfer based system . The integration of the given analyses in the Eurotra framework has been achieved as follows  . 
In analysis the tense and aspect forms are mapped onto their meanings  . This mapping is many-to-many and will , hence , result in the assignment of many meanings to one and the same form  . Disambiguation is done on the basis of the context  . Factors to be taken into account are the temporal adverbials and the Aktionsart of the basic proposition  . 
In transfer the tense and aspect meanings are simply copied : their representations are interlingual  . 
In generation the meanings are mapped onto forms . Unlike the mapping in analysis , this mapping is a function . 
The system presented in this paper has been applied to the nine Eurotral anguages and has been implemented in terms of the unification based Eurotra formalism  . Still lacking at this moment are the treamaent of the transposed uses of the tenses and the rules for determining the Aktionsart of basic propositions  .
