We already kuov+sy'~dac ~ i cill . -tbrm:~tion which should be and can be stored in a large dictionary d~tabase for ~ practical application such as a machine hanslatiou system  , t lowever , we still need ' more research on : ; emanlicint br-m ~ tion which can be prepared for a large system  . As a first step to construct ~ largescale semantic dictionary  ( lexical knowledge base ) the authors of this paper have inspected a machine readable ordinary English dictionary LDOCE  , Longrnanl ) ictionary of Contempo , : ary English ,  1 . 978 edition\[Procter 1987\] . 
Extr~ming semantic information ti'om an ordinary dictionary is ~ n interesting research topic  . One of the o~ims of automatic ex--traction is to produce a thesaurus  . No ' ~ l , for example , proposed the idea of thesaurus production fl'om LDOCE in\[No~l  1982\]  . 
Amsler also showed the result of automatic thesaurus production from a technia eal encyclopedia\[Amsler  1987\]  . Boguraev and AI--shawi haves t~ldied the . utilization of LDOCE for natural language proce ~ , : sfingre ' . ; earches in geuer M\[Alshwai1987, Bognraev 1987\] . 
in this paper , the automatic extraction of scntanticreh ~ tion -ships between words l ? om I  , DOCE is described . For the ex--traction , them ~ gnctict a peversion of 1 , 1) OCE is loaded into relation ald ~ . tabase system . Developc ~ extraction programs analyze the definition sentence in LDOCE with a pattern matddngba ~ d algorithm  . Since this algorithm is not perfect , the result of the extrac ; ;ion ha '~ been compared with semantic information  ( sem~mtic markers ) which the magnetict ~ peversion of bDOCF , co ~ rtains . The result of comparison is also discussed ibr evaluating the reliaLility of such ~ n automatic extraction  . 
, ~~, DB Version of LDOCE higener a . l , a dictionary consists of a complex dat ~ structure : various relationships between words  ; grammatical information ; usage l~otes , etc . '\[' here . for e , we need a special database ma . nage-mer * tsy . ~tem to handle dictionary data . l , brinst~nme , \[ Nag ~ m 1980\] shows ml cha system for retrieving a Japanese dictionary  . In this pa . per , however , the anthors are mainly interested in tile definition and tile sample sentence parts of I  , I )( )( ? E , ir a ; read of complex relati , ms among inlbrmation in the dictionary . 
For the sake of efticiency ( including the cost of sy : ; i . cmd cvetopment ) of \[ , DOCE retrieval , we have decided to u , '; ea cowventional relational databa . ~; emanagement system ( II ) BM) . ' i Fhe Ii . DBM which we use is running on the rnaia fr~mm eomputel of Kyoto University Data Proce ~ ing Center  ( FujitsuM 782 ,  () , q/IVl " 4MSP , FACOMAIM/RDB ) . 
For loading the magnetic version of LDOCE into this t\[I  ) li/i\[VI , we have extracted the following fields from I , I ) OCI , ;: 1 . I Iead Word ( IIW ); 2 . Part- . of-Speech(PS ); 3 . Deft-nitionNumber(DN);4 . Grammar ( ? ode(GC ); 5 . BoxCode(BC ); 6 . Definition ( Die ); and 7 . ~ ~ trnt)leSe . wtence ( SP ) . 
The Box Codefield contains various information such as semantic restrictions  , etc , which are explained in section 4 . 1 . 
The fields I through 5 are ahnost tile same as the origi- . 
halLDOCE data .   ( Several special characters are removed or changed into standard characters for simplicity of retrieval  . The syllable division mark ( . ) is removed . Some of the font control characters are changed into '<' and '>  . ' ) ' l'he definitions and the sample sentences are separated into a clause or a sentence  . For example , definition 1 of the verb to abandon is : to leave completely ~ md t brever  ; desert in the origin M data . This definition is transfl ) rmed into L wo set ) -state ebmses in the RI ) B version : 1 . to leave completely and for ever 2 . desert . 
Since every data in the RDB is repres ( mted in a tabular form , we have made three t ~ bles for the RDB version of I  , \]) OCF , ( I , DOCE/RDB , see table I regarding their its record format ) :4'59 t . Grammar Code and Box Code ' Fable ( LDB . D1) . 
2. Definition Table ( LDB.D2, see table 2).

3 Extra ( : tion of Semantic Information One form of semantic information useful for natural language processing is a thesaurus  ( or semantic network )  , which basically describe semantic relations between words  .   "1'o automatically produce the thesaurus from LDOCE , two programs have been dcveloped : 1 . Key Verb extraction program . 
'2. Key Noun and Function Noun extraction program.
These programs and the result of extraction are discussed in this section  . 
3  . i Key Verb Extraction Program Most of the definitions of verbs in LDOCE are described as: to VERB  . . . 
Usually VERB in tlf is pattern expresses a ' key concept ' of the defined verb  . Therefore , lec, . Uthis VER Ba Key Verb . 
For example , the verbs semantically related to the verb t0 hit have the tollowing definitions : estrike : to hit

Table 3 ( LDB V . D2) shows some examples of this extraction . In table 4, the frequency of key verbs is listed . Most frequently used keyver bisl0 make . Note that ~ o make and to cause are used to define causative and transitive verbs respectively  .

COUNT ( KV ) a thesaurus ( network ) of verbs has been obtained approximately . 
Most of the verbs in this tlu . ~ uurus makes treelike structure shown in figure 1 . I lowever , several ' loops ' are found . A ' loop ' exprea ~ es acyclic definition : ~ o welcome is defined by  t0 greet , and to greet is defined by lowel come . In the network , six typical cyclic definitions are : do : do ( the verb to do does not have a key verb . ) cha~tge:dtange , move ~ come , become ~ go:go , leave get : get , receive stop :: stop , ceaseolet : let , allow , permit Note that there are many other cyclic definitions in the network  . 
However , most of them have a link to another verb ; at least one of the verb in acyclic definitions is defined by another verb  . 
Since no reader of LDOCE cml understand the meaning of these verbs only from the dictionary  , these may be a kind of bug of the dictionary . However , these cyclically defined verbs seem to correspond to semanlic primitives  , which are first introduced to AI works by \[ Se hank  1975\]  . Semantic primitives may be defined outside of linfuislic words  . Details of the result of extraction are discussed in\[Nakamura  1986\]  . 
3o 2Key Noun and Function Noun Extraction
Program
We cau apply a similar algorithm to definitions of nouns  , although the pattern of definitions of nouns is mo ~ e complex than that of verbs  , ln~cting definitions with LDOCE/tt DB , most of the ma~e , classified into two forms : 1 . determiner adjective *\] Key Noun adjective phrase *  2  . determiner adjective * le-hnction Noun of Key Noun adjective phrase * The first one is a simple form and many of them express is a relations between a defined : noun and a key noun  . For example , abandon : the w ~ a Se when one's feelings sad actions axeu  ; a controIled shows that abandon is a slate . 
The second form expresses more complex ~ mantic relations between ouns  . 
abbey : the group of people living in such a building shows that abbey is-a-group-of people  . 
A function noun , therefore , explicitly expresses the semantic relation between a head word and a key noun  . 
With terras of a semantic network , defined nouns aml key nouns are nodes in a semantic network  , and function nouns ( when function noun is empty , its function noun is regared ~ kind ) expre ~ the name of a link betwee nodes . The following nouns (41 nouns , in total ) are considered to be function nouns , which are mannally extracted . 
is a:kind , type , ...
opart of : part , side , top , ...
member ~ shlp:set , member , group , class , family ,   . . . 
? action : act , way , action , ...
state : state , condition , ...
amount : amount , sum , measure , ...
degree : degree , quality , ...
? form : form , shape , ...
A program to extract key nouns and function nouns from the definitions of nouns is developed  , rl ~ ble 5 shows a part of the key noun and fmtction noun table in the LI  ) OCE/RI ) B ( LDBN . D2) generated by this program . 
As shown in table 6 , the key noun of highest frequency is person ( 2174 times ) and for function noun is type ( 1064 times ) except null function noun ( pattern 1 )  . 
' l Y aversing is a relation , for example , a thesaurus has been obtained \[ Nakamura 1987\] . Table 7 shows a part of the autmnat-ically obtained thesaurus  , whose ' root ' word is person : actor is a-kind -of person  ; comedian , e zlra , ham , and mime a rea-kind-of actor ; comedienne is a-kind-of comedian . 
4 Comparison between Result of Extract ion and BOX Code The the smlrus produced from LDOCE by the key noun and keyver bextraction programs is all approximate one  , and , obviously , contain several errors . The key noun of abbreviation 1 , for example , is shorler in table 5 , because the current program ignore sing-formed words  . However , it should be making . ( Even if we (: hanged the extraction algorithm , still we have a problem that making is not a simple noun  , but a gerund . We need to define noun-verb semantic relations . ) To evaluate the quality of the produced thesaurus  , the noun part of the thesaurus has been compared with the semantic markers in LDOCE  .

For example , there are 597 nouns whose function noun is ilct , and 584 nouns ( 97% ) of them are marked as ' abstract ' ; there are 398 nouns whose function noun is state , and 391 nouns (98%) of them are ' abstract . ' The distinction between < state ' and ' act ' , h ) r instance , is useful for natural anguage processing in general  . 
4.4 Nouns Marked as ' Inanimate '
Some ' Inanimate ' nouns are correctly identified in the produced thesaurus  ( table 11 )  . Especially ,   39% of nouns under the noun liquid have ' Liquid ' markers  , and 56~ of nmms under the noun gas have'G as ' markers . 
However , many < Inanimate ' nouns are defined by substance in LDOCE  . Sub-classification f these noun is expr ( ~sed with a compound word ( or an adjective ) as shown in table 11: coke is a solid substance ; fluorine is a non-metallic substance . Since the currect extraction program does not handle a compound word  , the thesaurus cannot express these classification . 
4.5 Other Typical Nouns
Several typical nouns in the produced thesaurus are also compared with markers of LDOCE  . Because the current system can . -not distinguish senses of nouns , nouns which have several different senses causes a problem  . A typical example is found in the definitions whose key noun is case  . As shown in table 12 , altache ease and teslease are both defined by case  ; these expr~ses cornpletely different concept . In 30 nouns whose keynoun is case,

' Difficulity of semantic marking is also found . For example , lexicographers could not mark ' movable ( J ) ' and ' Solid'systematically . For example , some nouns whose keynoun is cloth are marked as ' Solid '  , and others are marked as ' movable ( J ) '  ( table 13 )  . This is a probleming a the ring of semantic information itself  . 
5 Conclusion
The extraction of semantic relations between verbs and nouns from LDOCE is discussed  . Data from the magnetic version of LDOCE is first loaded into a relational database system for simplicity of retrieving  . For the extraction of semantic relations , programs to find keyver b , keynoun , and function noun have been developed . Using these programs , the thesaurus i automatically produced . 
? bevaluate the quality of the noun part of the produced thesaurus  , it is compared with the semantic markers in LDOCE  . Although the produced thesaurus has several problems such as the difficulty of expressing disjunctive concepts  , the comparison between the produced thesaurus and semantic markers in LDOCE shows the possibility of sub-classifi Cation of ' abstract ' nouns  .
