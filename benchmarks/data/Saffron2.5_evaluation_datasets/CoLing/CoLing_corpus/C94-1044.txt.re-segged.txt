We propose a lexical organisation fi ) rmullilingual lcxical databases ( MLDB )  . This organisation is based on acceptions ( word senses )  . We detail this lexical organisation m~d show a mock-up built to experiment with it  . We also present our current work in defining and prototyping a specialised system for the manage  , n cnt of acception-based MLDB . 
Keywords : mnltilingual exical database , acccplion , linguistic structure . 

Needs for largescale lexical resources for Natural Language Processing  ( NLP ) in general and for Machine Translation ( MT ) in p : uticular , increase very day . These resources , are considered to :: e present the most expensive part of a hnost any NLP system  . Ilcnce , an increasing interest in the development of reusable dictionaries can be observed  . 
q'o develop a Multilingual Lexical Database ( MLDB )  , we think of two main approaches . First , the tran . ~' rapproach where the links between the languages are realized via unidirectional bilingual dictionaries  . This approach is used by many MT systems and by some lexical database projects  ( notably Acquilex or Multilex )  . 
Second , the interling ttal approach where the links between the languages arc realized via an nnique interlingual dictionary  . The KBMT-89 project ( Knowledge Based Machine Translation ) at Carnegie Mellon University in the US and the EI  ) R .   ( Electronic Dictionary Research ) project in Japanusetiffs approach . 
In the context of multilingnal MT systems , we arc interested in the problems posed when constructing " rodusing an application and theory independent MLDB  . Wc are developing a Lexicall ) at a base Management Syslc In , NADIA , based on an inlerlingual approach . Wc chose acceptions as inlerlingual milts . NADIA provides re:my tools for the management of MLI  ) B s . Moreover , this system gives the linguist a great liberty in t bc choice of the linguistic structures  . 
We first give , an overview of the project , beginning with its lexical organization . Then , we give the results of our experimentations on this lexic  , ' dorganization . Finaly , we present our current work : the definition and prolotyping of a specialized system for the management of acception-based MLDBs  . 
NADIA is the continuation of a work done for the Multilex ESPRIT project  . The coherence checkcrand software architecture have been defined for Multilex and adapted to our lexical orga  , fizatinn . 
I . Acception-basod lexical organization After studying and comparing different projecls of lexic : ddat  ; dmses , including I"J ) R(E\[31 ~ .  1993) , KBMT-89 ( Nirenburg and 1) cfrise 1990; Good , nan and Nirenburg 1991 ) Multilex and of Mullilingual MT syslems , such as CICC ( Uchida and Zhu 1991 ) and ULTRA ( Farwcll ,   , guthriectal .  1992) , w clmve concluded in favor of an iutcrlingual lexical organization for our MLDBs  . 
Some of the inter , rational projects of lexical databases are based on a mult b bilingual approach  ( e . g . Multilex ) while others use knowledge representation as an interlingua  ( e . g . KBMT-89 or EI)P , ) . Much like ULTRA , our approach is interlingual and linguislic rather than knowledge-based  . 
1. The dictionaries
AMLI ) B consists of two kinds of diclionarics : lhc monolingual dictionaries and the acception dictionary  . 
1, 1, Monoli ~ dielionarics
The monolingual dictionaries arc accessible by entries  . 
These entries are le , mn as (" normal form " of words , e . g . in Snglish , infiniliv clk ~ r verbs , singt , lar for nouns , etc . ) . 
Items of the monolingual dictionaries ( monolingual acceptions ) are generally accepted meanings of words or expressions  , as wc can find them in standard printed diction a , ' ics . These monolingnal acccplions arc combined with their linguistic inlbrnmtion  . 
Monolingual acceptious of a language Larc acccptions that are connected to a word or an expression of L  . Such an acccption can be accessed from one ( or mo , ' e ) entries . 
1.2, Ace . option dic donm 2 ~
The interlingual diclio , mry , called acc(v ~ tion ? lictionaty , contains interlingual acctT ) timzs . Some in lkwnnalion c\[in be linked to these int crlingu : fl acceptions  . 
In a MLI ) B composed of n monolingual dictiouaries , the set of intcrlingual acccplions is equal Io the uuinn of the sets of monolingual acceptions of then dictionaries  , with an equality relation bound to the semantic identity  . 
Some contrastiv c problems may appear when two monolingual acceptious of two different languages are semantically slightly different  . This appears when there is a non-direct ranslation of a word  ( e . g . ' river ' can be translated in French by ' rivibre ' or by Tleuvc'l  )  . This kind of problem is solved by a relation from acceplion to sub-acception which is prc-defincd in all NADI Alcxical databases : the contrastiv c relation  . It is intended to code contrasive problems induced by a non-direct translation  , it 1A ' rivibre ' is a ralher small river fl ( ~ wlng into an nl heriver . A'fleuve ' is a large riverflowing into the , see .

2. I , exical organizati(m
In the acception-based lexical organization , the monolingual acceptions and the interlingual acccplions must satisfy the lbllowing criteria :   2  , 1 . Well-form cdness crileria , Each inter Iingual acctT tion correspomls to at & astonemono Iingual acception  . This criterion slates that an interlingual acccption must correspond to at least one entry of one language  ( as n to no lingual acceptions )  . 
? An interliagual acception corresponds to at most one monolingual acception of the same language  . 
An interlingual aeception is not necess ' ~ rily connected to amcmolingual acccption of each language of the MLDB  . 
? A monolingual acception corresponds to one and only one interlingual acceptiom A monolingual acception is always related to an intcrliugual acception and  ( as stated by the preceding criterion ) is one-one . 
2 . 2 . Translation criteria ? Two monolingual cceptions of diffi~rent languages correspond to a unique interlingual acception if  , and only if they have the same meaning . This criterion sta~es the semantic identity of two monoling ttalacce plions of different langtmg cs  ( provided that they correspond to the same interlingual acception  ) allowing the use of the interlingual dictionary for lexieal translation purposes  . 
? If entryel of language TA is translated by entry  e2 in language L2 via a non-dh'ect equivalence , the corresponding interlingual acception must be linked by the conm~stiverlation or by a relalion of quasi-synonymy  . This criterion allows the use of the acception dictionary for lexical translalion purposes even when there is no direct translation  . 
II . Experimentation l . The Parax mock-up In order to experiment this lexical organizatio  , t ,  1;: . Blanch as built the Parax mock-up ( Sdrasset and Blanc 1993 )  . 
This mock-np is a small acceplion-based lexical database of  5 languages ( Fmglish , French , German , I ~ . ttssian,

Parax , produced on Macinlosh with Ilypcr CardTM , was designed to experiment prol~letns inherent to the acception-based lexieal organization  , llence , items of the monoliugual diclionaries are combined with rather simple linguistic information  . 
An enlry of a monolingual dictiotmry is linked Io several acceplions  . These acceptions arc provided with their linguistic information  ( lc flc ( flumn in fig .  2) . l : . ach of these monolingual acceptions is related to an interlingual acccption along with its  ( lefinition ( in French ) and s0 mescmanlic infonnation ( righteol tnnn in fig .  2) .

2 . Indexing methodology 2 . 1 . Indexing in Parax As the platform we used for this mock-up was not specialized for such a task  , we have used an indexing methodology l br the construction of this MLI  ) B . 
The starting point of onr work was as maU French corpus we wanted to index  , llence , we begauto index French words and for each created acceptions  , we gave a translation it he other languages . 
After creating an entry , the lexicographer gives its different word senses , and their linked linguistic information ( the kind of information depends on the language of the entry  )  . 
Then , the lexicographer links the word senses to an interlingual cception  . As lhenumber of acceplions i still small , it is possible to select an , already existing a eception by browsing directly in the acception dictionary  . If the searched a ceeption does not exist , it is created along with a definition in French and some semantic in lk  ) rmation . 
2.2. Generalc , ~' ls.~
When developing alm gescale MLI ) B , it is no longer possible to select existing interlingual acceptions by directly browsing through the acceptiou dictionary  . 
Moreover , the different dictionaries will have to be iudexed by different lexicographers  . 11 encc , it is necessary to define another methodology . 
The process of creation of an entry and its monolingual acceptions does not change  . Aft Er creating an enlry , I he lexicographer selects a possible translation for the considered acception in a language of the database  . If this translation is already indexed in the target language  , he selects the corresponding acception in the target dictionary  . The source and target monolingual aeceptions are automatically linked to the same inlerlingual acception  . If the translation is not a h'eady indexed in the target language  , the lexicographer indexes it ( partially ) and asks the person in charge of the target dictionary to complete the new entry  . 
The acception dictionary is thus constructed and managed by the system and the lexicographers work in more or less thes  , -uneway as when indexing bilingual dictionaries . This automatic management of the interlingual dictionary involves the automatic verification of the criteria defined abxwe  . 
When a problem is detected the system attaches aw , -u-ning for the lexicographer in charge of the acception dictionary  , m~d proposes a default solution . 
3. Some results
The corpus we wanted to index in the Parax mock-up consisted of  135 entries in French corresponding to a representatives t of verbs  , nouns , adjectives , and adverbs of gener : dvocabulary . We have indexed these entries and the related aeceptions  . As we sutrted the indexation with qFrench corlms  , only some of the entries in the other languages have been given all their acceptions  .

Among these in tcrlingual aeceptions , 58 are sub-acceptious introduced by contr , ' t ~ tive problen ~ s . The size of this mock-up is of the same order as that of Multil cx  . 
III . Current work
Our current work consists in the dcfiniti ( m and prototyping of a specialized management system for acceplion based MLI  ) FIs . 
1. Related projecls
Some internalional projects have already started the development of a system for ML l  ) lis . We have studied and wense some of their reStll is . 
In Fmropc , we have participated in the Mullilcx project ( CFC-I ) GXIII-EsPRrI " project ) which aims at the definition of standards for lexieal databases systems  . We use some o1' its rcstzlts(e . g . the software architecture , some of the tools ) . 
Multilex's software architecture , based on three layers ( presentation level , internal level and database level ) , clearly separates the presentation from the coding and the coding from the storage of the information  . This organization allows to change Ihe presentation of the structures  ( giving the possibility to define user interfaces hiding the internal structure  )  . 
We have also studied the Jap : mescI:I ) R project which has developed large dictionaries of about  300  , 000 words in b of ll English and Japanese (200 , 000 of general vocal ml : u-y ,  100 , 000 of terminological vocabulary ) . FDR has also developediction : uies of 4(X ) , 000 concepts , dictionaries of 300 , 000 co-occun'cnces(bolh in F . nglish and Japanese ) and dictionaries of 300 , 000 bilingual culries ( both for J , 'qmucsc-l: . nglish and l';nglish-Japauesc ) ( I';I ) R1993) . 
In EDIt . , illdividtml concepts arc introduced in the word dictionary and correspond to the word senses  , llence , our acceptions are really close 1o their concepts , l lowever , they do not use a contrastiv c relation t ( ) code problems between the languages . 
The CICC ( Center of International Cooperation for Computerization  , Japan ) has also used a very close organization to construct a MLI  ) B ( Japanese , Chincse , Thai , Malay , and Indonesian ) for its Multiling u : d Machine Translation system . This lexical database coulains 50 , 000 wonls or terms ( Uchida and Zhu 1991) . 
2 . Toward a specialized management system A specialized management system for acception-based lexical databases must offer ways to automatisc the management of the a ceeption dictionary  . It must also offer tools to define , index and manage the monolingual dictionaries . 

The NAI ) IA system has to detect potential errHrs in the acceptiHn database  . Fachp Htenlial Errorisgi VEn IH a lexicographer who is in charge of the correctio  ,  .

The linguist defines lhelinguistic structures of the dictionaries with an Hl~ieCt-HrientEd hm guage  .

Coherence check in ff When the definition of the structure is done  , the linguist can define coherence rules that will be applied on the entries  . 
3.2.1. Three kinds of rule
The linguist cml define three kind of rules : ? I ntegrity rules apply to an article of a dictionary  . 
They ensure that none of the , article of the lexical database has an ill-funned configuration  . 
? Local coherence rules apply to different articlcs of the stone dictionary  . They ensure that the dictionary is coherent . 
? Global coherence rules apply to different articles of different dictionaries of tile lexical database  . The yell SUl'e some coherence between dictiouaries . 
3 . 2 . 2 . Three levels or cohere , ce rules " llle rules are , associated wilh a strength : ? Warning : when the constraint is overridden  , a message is passed to tile lexicographer , but all treatments , arc , allowed . The warning disappears as soon as lhe lexicographer validate stile entry  . These constraints arensed Io detect potential emirs  . 
? Delay : when the eonsmt in t is overrid den , tile lexicographe receives a mess : , ge and so nictreatments are forbidden on tile concerned entries  . 
Incorrect entries will not be accessible by extraction requests  . Interactive treatments such as browsing and editing are allowed  . These constraints are used to handle temporarily incomplet entries  . 
? Criticah these constraints can't be overrid den  . If a transaction over rides such a constraint , it will be cmlccled ( roll back ) . 
3 . 2 . 3 . Exmnple of coherence rule declarathm A coherence rule declaration is a method  ( ill the sense of I . ISP/Common Lisp Object System ) which is applied on all objects of the class defined in tile parameter lisl  . The body of tile rule is a lisp expression that must t ' CltJ rnTornil  . If the result is nil , the exception nm chanism corresponding to tim strength of tile rule is in w~kcd  . 
Ilere is an example of an integrity rule for the French dictionary  . This rule verifies that the derivation information is coherent with the category of tile a ceeption  .

In this paper , we have presented our work on MI . DBs . 
After a study of existing international projects and the definition and testing of the proposed lcxical organizat km  , we , are currently defiuing and prototyping a specialized system fer the management of acception-based MLI  ) Bs : the NADIA system . 
This system introduces new interesting points . First , the acception-based lexical organization seems to offer the advantages of an interlingual approach while avoiding some of the theoretical and methodological problems of the kuowledge-bascd approach  ( Sdrasset and Blanc 1993 )  . 
Second , it gives the linguis the possibility to freely dciine a collection of linguistic structures with a raflmr complete set of predefine data structures  . 
Our objective now is to integrate in this prototype features coming from research in the field of structured documents and a multidialectal facility illall tools  , ill order to provide lexicographers and other users with an interface iutheir mother tongue  . 

A part of this work was conducted illtile Multilex project  . 1 wish to tha , lkall Multilex parmers and GETA members for flmir supptu ~ and feedback  .
