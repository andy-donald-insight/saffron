This paper presents a brief overview of the bidirectional  ( Japanese and English ) Transfer-Driven Machine Translation system , currently being developed at ATR . The aim of this development is to achieve bidirectional spoken dialogue translation using a new translation technique  , TDMT , in which an example-based framework is fully utilized to translate the whole sentence  . Although the translation coverage is presently restricted to conference registration  , the system meets requirements for spoken dialogue translation  , such as two-way translation , high speed , and high accuracy with robust processing . 
1. INTRODUCTION
Transfer-Driven Machine Translation \[ ll , \[2\] , \[9\] ,   ( TDMT ) is a translation technique which utilizes empirical transfer knowledge compiled from actual translation examples  . The main part of translation is performed by the transfer module which applies the transfer knowledge to each input sentence  . Other modules , such as lexical processing , analysis , and generation , cooperate with the transfer module to improve translation performance  . With this transfer-centered translation mechanism together with the example-based  f'ramework\[3\]  , \[4\] . \[5\] , which conducts distance calculations between linguistic expressions using the semantic hierarchy  , TDMT performs efficient and robus translation . 
TDMT is especially useful for spoken language translation  , since spoken language expressions tend to deviate from conventional grammars and since applications dealing with spoken languages  , such as automatic telephone interpreta- tion\[6\]  , \[7l , \[ S\] , need efficient and robust processing to handle diverse inputs  . A prototype system of TDMT which performs bidirectional translation  ( Japanese to English and English to Japanese ) has been implemented . This bidirectional translation system simulates the dialogues between two speakers speaking in different languages  ( Japanese and English ) using an interpreting telephone system . Experimental results have shown TDMT to be promising for spoken dialogue translation  . 
2. TRANSFER-DRIVEN

The bidirectional TDMT system , shown in Figure 1 , translates English into Japanese and Japanese into English  . Conversion of the translation direction is simply done by flipping the mode selection switch  . Moreover , all of the sharable processing modules are used in both translations  . 
This bidirectional translation capability , along with other features adopted tbr spoken language  , shows the possibility of two-way dialogue translation  . 
The transfer module , which is the heart of the TDMT system , transfers source language expressions into target language x pressions using bilingual translation knowledge  . When another language-dependent processing , such as lexical processing , analysis , or generation , is necessary to obtain a proper target expression  , the required module is called by the transfer module  . In other words , all modules in a TDMT system function as a part o for hell  ) the transfer module . This transfer-centered architecture simplifies the configuration as well as the control of the machine translation system  .

X ' represents the English translation for X , and the English translations are noted in braces after the Japanese words for readers ' convenience  . )
X no Y -- ~
Y ' of X ' (( ronbun paper , daimohutitle) . . . . ) , Y ' for X'((beyaroom , yo yaku reserwltion ) . . . . ) , Y ' in X '( ( Tokyo Tokyo , haigi conference ) . . . .),
X ' Y ' (( enyen , heyaroom )....),
Fig .   2 An Example of Transfer Knowledge The first transfer knowledge  , " X no Y - , Y ' of X ' ( ronbun paper , daimokutitle ) " represents the translation example that a set ( ronbun paper , daimokutitle ) in structure " X no Y ' is transferred into structure " Y ' of X '  . " Thus , pattern selection is conducted using such examples  . When the source pattern " X no Y " is applied to an input  , the transfer module compares the actual words tbr X and g with the sets of examples  , searches for the nearest example set with its distance score  , and provides the most appropriate transferred pattern  . 
For example , if the Japanese input is " Kyoto nokaigi " and the nearest example set  ( X , Y ) would be ( Tokyo , kaigi ) , then the transfer module selects " Y ' in X '" as the translation pattern and outputs " conference in Kyoto  . " Thus , bilingual transfer knowledge consisting of patterns and translation examples is used in TDMT to select  , the most appropriate translation . 
To analyze a whole source sentence and to form its target structure  , the transfer module applies various kinds of bil in gual transfer knowledge to the source sentence t  . ql . Figure 3 is a list of different types of bilingual transfer knowledge  ( patterns and words )  , that are used with examples to analyze the Japanese expression " torokuyou shi wasu denio -mochideshouha " and to form its transferred result " do you already have the registration tbrm  . " As shown in Figure 4 , both the source and target structures are formed based on the distance calculation  . The numbers in brackets represent the transfer knowledge pairs in Figure  3  .

In other words , in the transfer module , both the source and target struct m'es are formed by applying the bilingual transfer knowledge extracted from the example database  .

Fig .   4 A Transfer Example for " torokuyoushi wasudeni o-mochideshouka " Multiple source structures may be produced in accordance with the application of the bilingual transfer knowledge  . In such cases , the most appropriate structure is chosen by computing the total distances for all possible combinations of partial translations and by selecting the combination with the smallest total distance  . The structure with the smallest total distance is judged to be most consistent with the empirical knowledge  , and is chosen as the most plausible structure .   ( See \[9\] for details of the distance and total distance calculations  . ) For instance , when the pattern " X no Y " is applied to the expression " i chi-manen  10  , 000 yenno heyaroom no yoyaku reservation , "there are two possible structures . 
1 ) ichi-manenno ( heyano ~ )  2 )   ( ichi-manen no he AL  ~ ) no ~ The TDMT system calculates the total distance for each of the structures  1  ) and 2 ) using the bilingual transfer knowledge stored in the system  . The following are the target structures when the transfer knowledge in Figure  2 is applied .   ( Source structures 1 and 2 give target structures 1' and 2'  , respectively . ) 1') 10 , 000 yen ( reservation for room )  2' ) reservation for ( 10 , 000 yenroom ) In this case , ( enyen , yo yaku reservation ) i 1 is semantically distant from the examples of " X no Y  , " which increases the total distance for structure  1  . Figure 5 illustrates the two sets of source and target structures generated by the transfer module of the TDMT system  . 
3.3 Sentence generation
The generation module completes the translation of the transferred sentence using target language knowledge that is not provided at the transfer stage  . This module performs the following two tasks in cooperation with the transfer module  . 
1) Grammatical sentence generation :
It determines the word order and morphological inflections  , and generates lexically essential words , like articles in English , so that the whole sentence is fully grammatical . 
2) Natural sentence generation :
It brushes up the sentence by changing , adding , or deleting word ( s ) so that the whole sentence is as natural as a spoken dialogue sentence  . 
Figure 6 shows an example of Japanese natural sentence generation where addition of a polite auxiliary adverb and deletion of redundant pronouns take place  .

4.3 System performance
The system has been trained with 825 Japanese sentences for JE translation and 607 English sentences f l ) rEJ translation . These sentences were selected from the ATR corpora and typical dialogues about the domain  . The system can translate sentences with a vocabulary of  1500 words . In JE translation , the system on a Lisp machine with 10MIPS performance has provided an average translation time of  1  . 9 seconds for sentences having an average length of  9  . 2 words , and a success rate of about 70% for open test sentences of this domain .
