1 Introduction
In this paper , we propose a dynamic theory of belief-sharing which dens with certain processes of forming and revising shared beliefs during cooperative dialogues  . 
Since Clark & Marsh Nl ( 1981 ) the problem of determination of the referents of referring expressions has been discussed in relation to mutual knowledge  . In natural language processing , there haw ~ also been several studies treating this problem of referent-determination in terms of mutuN knowledge  ( Perrault &: Cohen , 1981; Joshi , 1982; Nadathur & Joshi , 1983; Appelt ,  1985) . In this paper , we conceive referent-determination as a process of belicf-sllaring in dialogues  , and propose a formal theory of dialogue in which referent-determination can be characterized as part of belief-sharing processes  . We use Discourse Representation Theory ( DRT ) to model the characteristics of referents in discourse  ( Kamp ,  1981 , 1990; Asher ,  1993) , and propose a model of dynamic maintenance of the mutual beliefs of tile participants indiNogues based on Clause Maintenance System  ( CMS )   ( Doyle , 1979; Levesquc , 1989; Poole , 1988; Reggia , 1983; de Kleer , 1986; Rciter & de Kleer ,  1987) . By this nm del , we characterize the relationships between a di Mogue process and its suc-cessfulness  , which is mainly illustrated by examples of referent-determination but can be applied to any type of belief-sharing  . 
2 Dynamic Maintenance
Shared Beliefs of 2.1 DRS
However cooperative , realworl dialogues are fraught with hedges , under statements , or even white lies , which would necessitate introducing a distinction between what is literally conveyed by an utterance  , and its real intent on the part of both speaker and hearer  . 
In this study , however , we restrict ourselves to those cases without such complications  , and assume that an utterance reflects the speaker 's intent in a straight manner  , and is taken as such by the hearer . The content of an utterance is represented in tile following style:  ( 1 ) K : a , b , x , y , z . . . .
Bel(a , K ) ~ cl(b , IO .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   . 
A ( ~:), B(v ), C(~), ...
We call K discourse representation structure ( DRS )  , a , b , x , y , z . . . .  K's domain ( UK ) , the elements of UI < discourse referents , tile boxed are a below tile unbroken line K's condition part  ( CA- )  , and CK's elements conditions . K is represented as ( UK , CK . The broken line divides CK into the self -referent iNpart SRP  ( above the line )  , and the dialogue database DB ( K )   ( below the line )  . A con-dillon is the result of an n ( _> 0 ) times application of Bel ( ct ,  . ) to a first-order formula p . Bel(c ~, . ) is called a belief operator , where c~designates the ut-terer . Given ? as a condition , Bel(ce , ?) reads " the part Mpantabelieves ? . " n is called the rank of ? with regard to its embedding within belief operators  . Conditions of rank O are called bare formulas , while those with a rank greater than 0 belief formulas . K represents the shared beliefs formed through a dialogue between the two participants a and b  . The conditions in SRP indicate a recursive mbedding of self-referent iN belief sturueture with regard to e o  , n-monknowledge , and are assumed throughout the dialogue . By contrast , DB(K ) is empty when a dialogue starts off . Thus , at the outset of a dialogue , the DRSKo = ( a , b , Bel(a , Ko ) , Bel(b , K 0)) . As an utter-anteis made , new discourse entities may be introduced , making it necessary to add new conditions to DB ( K ) and sometimes to retractor negate part of the conditions in DB  ( K )   . With the progress of the dialogue , the DRS changes front K0 ~ K1 ~ . . .  =~
Kn = : ~...
Since only cooperative dialogues are considered , the goal is to arrive at a DRS in which no contradictory beliefs archeld by the participants  . But this go N is not M ways achieved . WeN so assume that at certain points of a dialogue  , the participants can hold contradictory beliefs , and that tile same pariticipant dialogue , whereas the s ; Hne particip ~ mt cannot hold contradictory beliefs ? ttany partic : ular point  . 
In what follows , we just indicate DB(K ) unless otherwise noted . 
2 . 2 How shared be l ie ig a re reg is te red An utterance made by ~  1  ) ~rticipmlt in a . di Mogue is transformed into a condition ( s ) and registered in DB ( K )   , folh ) wing the constrMnts tetted beh ) w . 
First , discourse referents m'e taken to be epistemo -logical entities without counterparts in sn rf acc sen-ten  ( ' es , but introduced into the DRS by the participants of ~ di Mogue  , and of which prot ) erties corresponding to surface linguistic expressions are l  ) redi-cared . Thus , an utterance ( 2 ) a : Sato is a student is not an Myzed~s ( 3 ) student ( Snto ) but as ( 4 ) Sato ( x )  , student ( x ) with the discourse referent a " introdu ( : edin to U~?1 ) ya , and the predicates corresponding to expressions in the utterauce  . 
Second , an utterance is registered not in the form of a bare formula  . , but in the fl ) rm of a 1 ) elief or lnula indicating the t ) elief agent . (4), tbr example , is registered as (5) . B cl(a , Sato(x ) , Bel(a , student(x )) because at (2) , b has not agreed with or opl ) osed a's utterance . Note the ft(5) is nevertheless ; t shared belief t ~ t this point . Suppose ( 6 ) is uttered folh ) wing upon ( 2 ) :  ( 6 ) b : Yes , he is . 
This utterance is interpreted as (7) Bet(b , Sato(x )) , BelCh , stu . dent(x )) and so registered in DB(K ) . At this t , oint , both (5) and (7) are shared beliefs , which me , ms (4) is a belief shared by a and b . This transition is t brumlated as the axiom of shared belief :  ( 8 ) The axiom of shared belief Whet , DUCK)cont ~ nsP , q( , * , v ) ,   , ~ nd13 ~ l(b , v ) , DB ( K ' ) obtained from DB ( K )  1 ) y the substitution of p for them is equivahmt to DB  ( K )   . 
DB ( K ) can bcderived fl ' om DB ( K ' ) without using this axiom , since Ktt ~ us the self-referential part SRP . 
But the converse does not hold . The ttxiom of shared belief Mlows the rank of shared beliefs to be zero  , while the conditions in general are initially registered with art m k higher than zero  . 
Third , there is involved a step of identification in the transition front b's utterance of  ( 6 ) to the condition ( 7 )  . Just as the discourse referent x was introduced by a ' s utterance of  ( 2 )  , b introduces a ( list in ct discourse referent y , in terms of which (9) BelCh , S . to(y )) , Bed(b , student(y )) is registered in DB(K ) . We ~ uSSulne that a and b ~ greetotiu ' , identity of x and y ~ Lt this point . 
To sum up , in dialogue (2) ,  (6) , DB ( K ) is composed of ( 5 ) a hme when ( 2 ) is uttered , hut is extended by the utterance of ( 6 ) as follows : 0 ( ) ) wt (  , , , : , := y ) , B , ~ t(~ ,  . ~= v ),
Bed(a , Sato(x )) , Bel(a , Sato(y ) , ~ l(b , s , ,to ( , ) ) , ~ l(b , S ~ to(v) , Bel(a , student(:r )) , Bet(a , student(y )) , Bel(b , student ( a , )) , BelCh , student(y )) . 
By applying the axio in of shared belief , midx = : y , we obta . in (11) Sat@c ), student(x )
By contr~st , (12) l.a : Sato is a student.
2.b : No , he is a not fice cler know.
can only h~v c its DB(K ) reduced to (13) Sato (: , :) , lJel(a ,   , s t ~ d c m . t(x )), Bel(h,oJlice_cle,rk(x )) . 
3 D iachron ic ana lys i s o f d ia - logue In this section  , we consider the changes DRS's undergo in the course  , of ~ t dialogue . In (2) , (6) in the previous section , we saw a case where a DRS with nothing buts hm'ed beliefs is successfiflly obtMned in one inning  , so to speak , without incurring any conflict . We will look at the other three kinds of cases in which conflicts are treated in particular ways which t Mlnit of form Mization in terms of CMS  . 
3.1 Direct solution of conflicts
Consider the following dialogue.
(1.4) 1. I~:Satois~t good guy.
2.b : By no means , heisaliar.
3. a : No kidding.
Just after (14 . 2) is uttered , DB(K ) looks as follows : (1~) w~t ( . , : , ; : : , j ), Vel(b , . = y ), Ba(c , , s ~, to ( . )), u~t(c ~, st , to(v)),
Uet (*, , S . to ( . ~-)), ~ et(b , Sato(v)), . ~t ( , , , , oo(t0,,)), . c ~ l(t ,, / i ( , . (v)) . 

The utterance of (14 . 3 ) is considered as the consequence of an inference such as this:  ( 16 )  1 . x = y2 . Sato(x ) 3 . Bet(a , good(x )) 4 . Bel(b , liar(x )) is derived from (15), (16 . 3-4 ) do not bring about an inconsistency since they are belief formulas with different propositions inside  . But obviously , a has drawn an inconsistency by taking off the belief operators  , and carrying out the following inference . 
(17) 1 . x = y2 . liar(y ) 3 . liar(x ) 1, 24 . V x ( liar(x ) -*-, good(x )) 5 . - good(x ) 3, 46 . good(x ) 7 .  \[\] 5,6
Suppose ( 14 ) is continued as follows: ( 18 ) a : I meain the Sato intile linguistics department  . 
b : () it , It hougt it you were talking about the Sato in the AI department  . The one you mean is indeed a good guy . 
(19) a : He does sometimes . But you can't dislike him . 
b : I guess not.
In this case , in order to avoid the conflict , one traces its causes , and retracts the weakest one (16 . 1) for (18), and (17 . 4) fro ' (19), or replaces it by its negation . 
As a result ,  (18) , for examle , is associated with (20) Bel(a , - ~ x = y ) , 
B ~ l(a , Sato(x )),
Bel(a , Sato(y )),
Bel(b , -, x = y ), nd(~, Sato(x )), ~ el(~, Sato(y)),
Bel(a , LiD(x )), Bel(a , AiD(y)),
Bd(a , Vx(li ~, '( x)-,~good(x ))),
Bel(b , LiD(x )), Bel(b , AiD(y)),
Bcl(~,Vx(liar(x)-*~qood(x ))),
B ~ l(~, good(x )), ~ el(~,liar(y)),
Bel(b , good(x )), Bcl(b , liar(y)).
All Bel's can be taken off in (20) , resulting in (21) ~ x = y , Sato(x ) , Sato(y ) , LiD(x ) , AiD(y ) , V x ( liar(x)-*~good(x )) , 9 ood(x ) , liar(y ) , which is shared by a and b . 
3.2 Indirect solution of conflicts
Consider the following dialogue.
(22) 1 . a : Today's meeting is held at 203, isn't it?2 . b : No , I heard it is at the small conference rool n ,  3 . b : Who to ht you that ' ? 4 . a : Sat ( ) told me yester day . 
5.b : That's strange.I'll call the office.
6 . b : They say it was changed fl'om 203 to the small coifference room today . 
7. a : I see.
The inference of ( 22 ) is formalized as follows: ( 23 )  1 . Sato 2 . Sato ~2033 .  203 4 . office 5 . office-*s . e . r6 . s . c . r 4, 57 . s . c . r -*-~2038 .  -1203 6, 7 9 . \[\]3~8 In this case , the conflict between (22 . 1) and (22 . 2)1,2 cannot be solved between themselves .  (22 . 3) to (22 . 6 ) reflects the process of deciding which is to be preferred by tracing the source of each condition  . That is ~ when one cannot choose between two conflicting conditions Pl and  p2 on their own account , one replaces Pl and p2 by ql , ql--*Pl and q2 , q~'~P2 ~ respectively , and decide which of ql ,   q2 is to be preferred so that one can avoid the conflict by retracting the weaker condition in favor of the stronger  . 
3.3 Conflicts ending in a draw
Consider the following case.
(24) 1.a : That's Muranish i over there.
2.b : No , it's Hokuto.
3. a : Really ?
This case is formalized ~ s follows : (25) 1 . x = y2 . Hokuto(y ) 3 . Hokuto(x ) 1, 24 . Muranishi(x ) 5 . Vx ( Muranish . i(x ) -*-, Hokuto(x )) 6 . - ~ Hokuto(x ) 4, 57 . \[\] 3,6 As (24 . 3) indicates , there is no retractable belief in DB(K ) , which caused the diMog to end in a break down . 
3  . 4 Formal i za t ion o f d iachron ic ana ly - s is The processes of belief revision illustrated in  3  . 1 through 3 . 3 canbeh ) rmalized as in (27) . First , we define some terms : dialogue , and /3 the other . 
ii ) Given p in DB(K ) , substitute Bel((e , p ) and Bel(fl , p ) for it . When Bel((e , p ) is replaced by Bel((e , " ~ p ) , it is called p's self-denial by ( r . When Bel(c ~ , p ) is simply retracted , it is called p's self-withdraw , ' d by ( e . 
iii ) When Bel((~ , p ) , Bel(/J , p ) , and p are substituted for by ~ p , it is called p's strong-denial . 
When they are simply retracted , it is (: ailed p's strong-withdraw M . 
iv ) Let E be a set of Horn-clauses , PI(E ) the set of its prime implieants . When ~ p-~p ~ , . . . , ~ p ,, for any qV-~p ~ V . . . V ~ p,~ePI(E ), q is subordinate , ~ op . 
(27 ) Whenever a new condition is added to DB ( K ) in response to a dialoguent ove , the participant ( estarts her CMS , calculates a way of resolving any contlict , and revises DB ( K ) dymunically : 1 ) a ) When a condition is explicitly registered in DB ( K )   , strip off its belief operator ( if any ) , add it to CMS as an atomic formula . 
b ) Add implicitly assumed conditional such as Vx ( Muranishi ( x ) - - ~ ~ Hokuto ( x ) ) to CMS as an atomic formula . 
c ) Add the implicit inference ruh ! s in the ( lial ( )gue to CMS ~ s a conditional formula . ( E . g . , the inference rule a , b/ceorresl ) onds to the conditional formula c~-a , b . ) 2 ) Let E be t it ( ! set of CMS-cbmses obtained in 1 )  .

4 Synchronic analysis of dia-logue Next , according to Ogata (1993) , we consider a classification which characterizes the degree of belief sharing for the t  ) articip mtts at al ) articular point of the conversation , and the eorre (: tness of the shared beliefs . 
(28 )  1 ) The beliei ~ are all shared by the participants : see  ( 2 )  , (~) above . DB(K ) , : o , ,tai , s ~ oeo , di-lions l ) re , tixed with B cl . Since the set of belie , fs of either part Mpant is . considered to be consistent , I'I ( E ) V\[\]fi ) rtile CMS corresponding to the DRS . 
2) There remain some conditions prefixed with Be . l in DB(K ) , but PI ( E ) y\[\] for the CMS cor-res l ) on ( ling to the DRS . A typical c~use , is when / ~' s ~ ussertions prol ) erlyincht de ( ~' st ) eliefs and about the rest of ~' s assertions ( ~ has not been able to decide in one way or another  . 
3 ) There remain some ( : onditions prefixed with BeI in DB ( K )   , and PI(E)I-E ~ . This is a case of breakdown , ' ~ ~ seen in (25) . 
We call tites e three (' ~ uses , respectively , 1) obser-w ~ tionally susscessful , 2) observ ~ Ltionally consistent , and 3) obserw ~ tionally unsuccessful . 
Take the ease of (2), (6) again . T i t ( , d Mogue was suc-cess fiflly terminated because the Satoa had in mind and the Satobhadin mind were both students  . But suppose a's Sa to was a student in the linguistics  de-1  ) artm ( mt , and b's Sato in the AI department ,  ( . hatis , they were different persons . Or suppose a and b had the same Sato in rain ( , but that he was no longer a student ; ~ t the time . These two eases are obscrwttion-ally suc ( : essfifl , hut the part Mpant send a 1 ) with the wrong beliefs . In order to meet this gat ) ~ we introduce a standard of correctness that might beem l  ) odied by God's viewpoint , the reality , or the conventions of the language community to which the  1  ) articipants belong . We call this standard the facts . The categories in ( 28 ) are further broken down relative to the facts as in  ( 29 ) : Detine K ' as the result of adding the Nets to tim DB  ( K ) of a DRSK , and extending UI ? accordiugly . 
Let PI ( EI ) be the set of prime implicants fi ) r the CMS corresponding to DB ( K / )  . The facts are a set of bare for mub~s . Then ( 28 ) is subclassifled as follows: ( 29 )  1 ) ol ) servationally su ( : c , essfuia ) m (~') Vu , b)m(s')~-u . 
2) observationally consistent a ) m(E ') VE l ,  1 , ) m(s ') ~ u . 
3) obserwttionally unsuccessful
PI(EI)F ~ .
We cM1 la ) strongly successful , 2a ) strongly consistent , and the rest ( the cases where PI ( N  ~ ) Fn ) strongly unsuccessful . A comparison of ( 28 ) and ( 29 ) suggests the folh ) wing implications whose converses do not hold : ( 3 ( I ) a ) strongly successfltl ~ observationally success -tiff  1  ) ) obserwt . tionallym ~ suc (' . essful-~strongly un-su ( : cessfulc ) strongly consistent - ~ observationally consistent referring to individuals We consider the problem of how the concepts of success introduced in the previousection might be applied to the dialogues identifying the denotation of individual terms  , especially proper nouns . 
(31) a : That's Sa to over there.
b : Yes , it is.
DB(K ) for (31) is (32) a)x = y , b ) Sato(x ) , Sato(y ) . 
If a and b believe there is only one Sato in this situation  , (32b ) becomes (33) Bel(a , tx . Bel(a , Sato(x )) = x ), ~ el(b , , x . B cl (~, Sato(x )) = ~),
Bel(a , tx . Bcl(b , Sato(x )) = y ), ~ el(b ,, ~ . Bel(b , Sato(x )) = y) , which gives rise to (34) tx . Bel(a , Sato(x )) = x , , x . Bel(b , Sato(x )) = y . 
From this , we obtain by (32a ) (35), x . Bel(a , Sato(x )) = , x . ~el(~, Sato(x )) . 
If ( 31 ) is a case of strong success in which " Sato " correctly refers to the unique Sato  , DB(Kt ) contains (36) x = z , tx . Sato(x ) = z . 
From (323) ,  (34) , and (36) , we ca , , derive (37) tx . Sato(x ) = tx . Bel(a , Sato(x )) = , x . Bel(b , Sato(x )) . 
In general , of an atomic formula T ( x ) , we call tx . Bel(a , T ( x )) a's intended referent , tx . Bel(b,T ( x )) b's intended referent , and tx . T ( x ) the semanite referent . Thus , a strongly successful dialogue with regard to an identification of an individual referent is a case where a ' s intended referent  , b's intended referent , and the semantic referent all coincide . 
However , if in ( 31 ) the individual referred to is Ki-nosh it a rather than Sato  , DB(Kt ) will contain (38) ~( z = x) , ,x . Sato(x ) = z . 
If a and b have different Sato's in mind , DB(K ~) will contain (39) tx . Sato(x ) = t,~(~=x) . 
In either case , the result is strongly unsuccessflfl : ( 40 )  -~ ( tx . Sato(x ) = tx . BeI(a , Sato(x )), -~( tx . Sato(x ) = tx . BeI(b , Sato(x ))) . 
A case of being observationally unsuccessful such as  ( 24 ) will be ( 41 )  -~ ( tx . Bel(a , Sato(x )) = tx . Bel(b , Sato(x ))) . 
By indicating a ' s intended referent , b's intended referent , and the semantic referent by Ta , Tb , and Tcom , respectively , we can summarize what has been discussed above as follows:  ( 42 ) strongly successful : Tcom = Ta = Tb , observationally successful : Ta = Tb , strongly unsuccessfld : Tcom ? Ta , 
Tcom ~ Tb , observationally unsuccessful : Ta ~ Tb . 
5 Conclusion
In this paper , we proposed a system which combines DRS with CMS , and an Mgorithm for the dynamic revision of shared beliefs in cooperative dialogues  . Further , the degree of success in dialogues was formalized . 
Still , the following problems remain to be solved : 1 ) The treatment of background knowledge must be made precise  . E . g . , ' Sato ~ 203' in (23) , or ' Vx ( Muranishi ( x ) - ~" ~ Hokuto ( x ) )' in ( 25 ) is im-plicitely introduced into the inference without explanation of its origin  . 
2 ) The translation procedure of an utterance into the condition of DRS must be formalized  . 
3 ) It's necessary to give a semantic foundation to our systen l  . 
4 ) hnplelnentation fasy stem which simulates our dialogue mechanism  .
