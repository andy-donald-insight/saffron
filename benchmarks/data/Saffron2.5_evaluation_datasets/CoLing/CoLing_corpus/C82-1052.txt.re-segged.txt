The paper discusses the role of argumentation schemata and their interaction with other knowledge sources within a computer model for in depth understanding of newspaper texts about job market developments  . Some of these schemata are presented ; the " ALTHOUGH . . . "- argumentation(German:"TROTZ . . . ") and its formalization are discussed in detail . 
1. Introduction
Reading newspapers may be seen as an " everyday cognitive task "  . Therefore it is not astonishing that some work in Artificial Intelligence aims at the simulation of aspects of the understanding processes of newspaper readers\[Eisenstadt  1977  ; Rosenberg 1977\] . There have even been pioneering system ~: the Script  ~0plier Mechanism \[ Cullingford 1978\] demonstrated careful reading of " event ~- -oriented news stories about earthquakes  , vehicle accidents , plane crashes and so on , whereas FRUMP\[DeJong 1979\] si ~ Jlated skimming abilities using texts about the same themes  . 
We are working with texts about job market developments taken from West German newspapers \ [ Laubsch & Roesner  1980\]  . An important aspect of our texts is that they deal with argtm ~ ntations about reported data and their respective changes  . In this paper we describe our ( not yet implemented ) conceptual approach for processing such structures  . 
2. Understanding ar~nents tion
In our view , argtm ~ ntation schemata in general work on a kind of " theory " of the domain of discourse  , i . e . on a structure that encodes knowledge about domain-specific dependencies  . We use a dependency-network in order to represent the average reader's expertise and qualitative reason in @ ability about the job market  . 
Our representation is influenced by ideas from\[ Sussman & Steele  1980\]  . 
In some sense , one may interpret an argtm ~ ntation schema as a function that takes propositions  ( < PROP > s ) as arguments . In case of coherent or correct use , these propositions have to fulfill certain constraints that are defined with reference_to the " theory " of the specific domain of discourse  . 
Thus , wundersta ~ ir ~" ~ tati ( m ~ in terms of these schemata can be seen as establishing the constraint relations between given propositions by an inference mechanism that operates on the dependency net of the domain  . This always involves testing on discourse coherence  ( if it is assumed to have a correct " theory " ) and/or checking the " theory " ( if it is assumed to have correct texts )  . 
325326 D . F . ROESNER and J . H . LAUBSCH3 . Explanation schemata Explanation schemata deal with reasons-incur domain these are mostly reasons for the job market fluctuations under discussion  . Although we use German surface-oriented labels ( which we transcribe into ~ glish )  , we are discussing all of the following examples as deep structures that may be underlying to diverse surface constructs  . 
~i > < PR~a-2>': ( ~- OF < PROP-l > < PROP-2 > ) This is a general explanation schema . If used correctly , then < PRUP-I > gives reason ( s ) for < PROP-2> : If < PROP-l > isa " simple " fact in our theory  , then there must be an inference path in the dependency netalng cause-effect links leading from < PROP-l > to <  PROP-2>  . If < PROP-I > is a conjunction of two ( or more ) " simple " facts , then inference paths starting from those points must interfere in such a way that they finally lead to <  PRDP-2>  . 
Among German surface triggers for the BECAUSE-OF -schema are:"WEGEN  . . . ", " WL " . . . ", " DA . . . ", " DURCH . . . "," AUFCAqD % D % ~ N . . . ", " INFDLGEDES . . . ", but also more elaborate ones like " . . . DARAUF ~ ENDASS . . . " or " . . . DAMIT ~ EN
DASS " < PROP > ': ( MOREOVER < PROP >)
This schema may be used if we are discussing a complex situation where consequences of several factors interfere and where the already mentioned  ( or derived ) propositions are not sufficient to explain a given result  . < PROP > must satisfy the constraint that it gives additional supportive reason for an unexplained effect  , i . e . < PROP > opens a new inference-path in the dependency net such that interference with previousi~letepaths is possible in a way which finally produces the explanation that is searched for  . 
< PR~*-I><PR~*-2>': ( ALTH0\[K~<PROP-l > < PROP-2 > ) This sch ~ na deals with expectations and their non -fulfillment  . Other surface manifestations are constructs like "   O~90HL < PROP-l > < PROP-2>"  , " UNGEACHTET < PROP-i > < PR0P-2>" or " ZWAR < PROP-l > D~k%X3CR  <  PROP-2>"  . 
The relation between < PROP-l > and < PROP-2> in an ALTB0t~H-schema involves a third proposition < PROP-2'>  , whose constraints are : a ) < PROP-2'> is in a contradictive relation ( e . g . negation ) to < PROP-2>b ) < PROP-2'> could be expected as a ( default ) conm ~ uence of < PROP-l > ( or in other words : ( BECAUSE-OF < PROP-l > < PROP-2'> ) could be verified )  . 
Incoherent texts the contradiction between expected and actual development given with an  ALTH0t~R-schema will demand further explanation .   ~0~@exsta~ing " ~ lamat/cm thus involves answering the following questions : AI : ~ lat was the unfulfilled expectation <  PROP-2'> contrary to < PROP-2>?   I%2: Why did the expects tion ~ s ) < PROP-2'> fail ? A3:~at caused the fact ( s ) of < PROP-2> to happen ? Until we cannot sufficiently re = . x ) Ive these explanation tasks , the ALTH0t~B-sche~a will keep active and guide the processing of further input  . 
4. A detailed example
In order to clarif your_approach , letustrace the processing of the flow of argumentation in an actual newspaper article  ( taken from " Stbttgarter
Nachrichten ", March 7, 1979).

MOD:~(LEICHT ) ~))) ( Slot-fillers with , , en have been taken literally from the given sentence and are processed by " specialists " ~ e ? g~IHFEBRUAR is interpreted-ao cording to a default text convention-as publication year's february  . ) The first step in processing AL~THOL~JH-I is to construct  PROP-2' as a negation of

In this case , the " subject " of PIRDP-2 is " CHANGE-INR-~ ( IN ~ FIRGINFEBRUARY . .)" , whereas the " predicate " is the filler of the VALUE-slot  , i ? e o SLIGHT-DECREASE . The procedure for generating a candidate PROP-2' preserves the " subject " , but negates the " predicate " . 
What is the negation of a SLIGHT-DBCREASE ? For pur~s of qualitative reasoning  , we take VALUEs for CHANGEs frcma five point scale from "++"  ( ~- INCRFASE ) to " ~" ( ~- DECRFASE )   , i . e . " - ~ corresponds to SLIGHT-DECREASE . Interpreting negation of SLIGHT-DECREASE as simply taking the complement of-with respect to t / ~ e set of all VALUES = ++  ,  + ,  0 ,  - , -- would yield I ~- DECREASEL % ICHANGI ~ ) SLIOFf-~~-INCREASE\] , but a constraint for surface constructs allows us to  exclu61e IARGE-DECI % EASE in this case . 
If a larger value had been expected ( and not the opposite direction of change )  , then this would have been indicated by a modifier like " NUR "  ( EngI . " ONLY " ) as in : TIIOTZDERSAI ~ EIMOK " rOBERSTIES DIEARBEIT ~ LOSEN ~ INDEMM ZX ~ IAT NURIIM  0oi AUF 3  . 3 PROZENTAN ( from " Stuttgarter Nachrichten " , Nov .  7, 1979) .

Thus : the structural analysis yields
PROP-2': ( CHANGE-2

The next step in order to answer A1 is : Can PROP-2' be expected given PROP-l ? Indeed : we find a ( generic ) default rule in our dependency net , that relates WINTER WEATHER with a ( ~IANGE of NR~~ .
