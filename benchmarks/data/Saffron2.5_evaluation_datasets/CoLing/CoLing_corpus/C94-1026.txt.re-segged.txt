To align bilingual texts becomes a crucial issue recently  . Rather than using length-based or translation -based criterion  , a part-of-speech-based criterion is proposed . We postulate that source texts and target exts should share the same concepts  , ideas , entities , and events . Simulated annealing approach is used to implement this aligmnent algorithm  . The preliminary experiments how good performance . 
Most importantly , the experimental objects are ChineseEnglish texts  , which are selected from different language families  . 
1. Introduction
Real texts provide the alive phenomena , usages , and tendency of langnage in a parlict flar space and time  . 
This recommends us to do the researches on the corpora  . Recently , many rese~rcherstimber claim that " two languages art more informative than one "  ( Dagan ,  1991) . They show that two languages coukl disambigna . te each other ( Galee?al . , 1992) ; bilingual corpus could form a bilingual dictionary  ( Brown et al , 1988) and terminology correspondence bank ( Eijk ,  1993) ; a refined bilingual corpus could be formed the examples for machine translation systems  ( Sumita et al . , 1990) . To do such kinds of researches , the most impmlant task is to align the bilingual texts  . 
Many length-based alignment algorithms have been proposed  ( Brown et al , 1991; Gale and Church , 1991a ) . The correct rates are good . However , the languages they processed belong to occidental family  . 
When these algorithms are applied to other rtmning texts from different families  , will the performance keep on tile same level ? Other translation-based alignments  ( Kay , 199 l ; Chen ,  1993 ) show the difficulty in determining the word correspondence and are very complex  . 
In tiffspaper , we will introduce a part-of-speech ( POS ) -based alignment algorithm . Section 2 will touch on the level of alignment and define the sentence terminators  . In Section 3 , we will propose tile criterion of critical POSes and investigate the distribution of these POSes in the ChineseEnglish texts  . Section , l will describe a fifir and rigorous method for evaluating performance  . Then , we apply simulated annealing technique to conducting experiments and showtile experimental results in Section  5  . Section 6 will give a brief conclusion . 
2. Alignment Problem
Alignment has three levels : 1) paragrapll ; 2) sentence ; and 3) word . Paragraph level is sometimes called discourse level  . Many efforts are involved in senlence level and fewer researchers louch on the word level  ( Gale and Clmrch , 1991b ) . To do sentence alignment , we should first define what a sentence is . ILl English , tile sentence terminators are fifll stop , question mark , and exclamation mark . \[\[ owever , timusage of punctuation marks is unrestricted in Chinese and the types of punctuation marks are numerous  ( Yang ,  1981) . Nevertheless , in order to parallel the languages , we define that tile sentence markers are fldl slop  , question mark , and exclamation mark over all languages . The relbre , an alignment of two texts is to find a best sequence of sent cncegroups  , which arc ended with one of tile sentence t rnlillal or s  . 
Following Brown el al . (1991), we use tileterm bead . A bead contain some sentences of source and largct texls  . Thus , alignment can be defined as (1) . 
( I ) An alignment is to find a bead sequence under some crileria  . 
If I he applied criteria are significant , he performance will be good . Finding significant criteria is tile core of this research  . 
3. Criteria of Alignment
ALLy aligmnenl algorilhm has its own criteria . For example , many alignment algorithms are based on sentence lengfl ~ and word correspondence  . Here , wc propose a POSes-based crilerion . 
(2 ) Alignment Crilerion : " File numbers of critical part of speeches  ( POSes ) of a langt , age pair in an aligned b cad are close . 

Now , the problemix what forms the critical POSes . 
Following many gr ~ , mmar formalisms ( Sells ,  1985) , the content words will be the good indical ors . 
Therefore , we think nouns , verbs , and adjectives as the critical POSes . In addition , we inch , demm ~ bers and quotation marks in the critical POSts due to intuition  . 
The English tagging system used in this work follows that of the LOB Corpus  ( Johansson ,  1986) . The Chinese tagging system follows that of the BDC Corpus  ( BDC , 1992) but with some modilications . 
The BI ) CCOrlms docs not assign tags to Imnctualion marks  . We adopl I he same philosophy of I , OBC or pusto assign the tags of the punctuation marks as themselves  . These critical POSes in English and in Chinese arc listed in Table  1  . N-represents all lags initialed with N , i . e . , - is a wildcard .

On the one hand , the POSes may be changed within an alignment ; on the other hand , a sequence of English words may correspond to a Chinese word  . These phenomena make the alignment much harder . How Ever , Table 2 shows that these POSes are good indicators for alignment  . 
4. How to Evaluate the Performance
Before proceeding the experiment , another important issue is how to ewfluate the correct rate for an alignment  . No literatures to n ch on this issue . We just find in literatures what performance is rather than how to evaluate it  . Note that aligmnent has the order constraint . On the OnEh and , when an error occurs , the performance should drop quickly . On the other band , the error will not broadcast to the next paragraph  . That is to say , the error will be limit cd in a range . Our criterion for evaluating performance takes care of the two factors  . 
For a given text , we could manually find the real alignment . This alignment consists of a sequence of beads , as mentioned previously . We call the sequence of beads Real Bead Sequence ( RI?S )  . In contrast , we may apply any alignment algorithm to finding an alignment  . We call this aligmnent Contputed Head
Sequence ( CIL'?).
Ill order to evahlate the perforln ancc of tile alignment algoritlun  , WE filrth cr define the lncrent ental Bead A ' eq Hence  ( IIS )  . 
(3 ) hTcremental Bead Sequence 1BS of a given bead sequencc BS is a bead scquence , such that \[ lead\]fli in IBN iss nmmation of 15   ( 0 _< . j . <_i-1) in IJS . 
Therefore , two possible II 3Ses , 1RBS and/C\]IS , are generated under this consideration . We define performance for an alignment as ( 4 ) Performance = nutnber of common beads in IRI3S and ICBS number of beads in IRBS Table 3 demonstrates how to calculate lhc perform ancE . Two beads ,  (3 , 3) and (10 , 10) , are shared by II?BS and ICIS . The total numllcr of beads in IR eS is 10 . Therefore , the performance is 20% . In the following experiment , we will use this method to evahmte performance .

Alignment Algorithm The alignment algorithms proposed in the past literatures try to find an optimal alignment which Ires the largest alignment probability  . Due tollle very large search space , they all consider only five types of beads : (0 , 1) ,  (1 , 1) ,  (1 , 2) ,  (2 , 11 , and (1 , 0) . After examining our corpus , we can find other types of beads such as (1 , 3) and (1 , 4) . Furthermorc , b cad type (2, 4) is also found . Table 4 list stile distribution of bead types in the testing lexts  . Eiphlbead types appear in tile bilingual texls . Bead type(l , l ) is the majority (63 . 9%) . Bead types (1 , 31 ,  0 , 4) , and (2 , 4) , which : ire not treated in other papers , occupy 8 . 2% . If the alignment algorithm did not dcal with these bead types  , the correct rate would be bound to 91 . 8% .

A good algorithm should satisfy tile following two conditions : It is a general local search algorithm  . 
It allows the unlinfited bead types in the aligning process  . 
Under this consideration , simulated annealing approach ( Aarts and Korst , 1989) is used to align texts . 
The idea of annealing comes from condensed matte , " physics . It involves two steps : 1 ) increasing temperature of matter ;  2 ) decreasing temperature gradually until the matter in the ground configuration  . 
Simulated annealing is to sinudate the almealing process  . Therefore , a simnlated annealing mechanistn is composed of four parts : configuration  , ( ransition fimction , energy fimction , and annealing schedule . If we take an alignment as a configuration , the possible alignmenls constitute tile configuration space  . In addition , every configuration is associated with an energy . The optimal configuration is tile one which has tile lowest energy  . Simulated annealing is to find tile optimal configuratio  , if roman initial configuration by generating a sequence of configurations under a control parameter  . 
For our application , we introduce another component , Transition Vector . The five components are defined as follows . 
(5 ) Configuration ( C ) : An alignment is a configuration naturally . For example , a possible bead sequence ,  (1 , 21 , ( I , 1) ,  (1 , 1) ,  (1 , 2) ,  (1 , 1) , is a configuration . 
(6) 7) ' ansition l , ' unction(T ): Given a configuration , this fimction is responsible for generating its next configuration  . A transition vector is generated ill random , alld then tile transition ftmction moves one configuration to another configuration according to the transition vector  . 
(7 ) 7' ansition I/ector ( TV ) : A transition vector consists of 4 components ( H , N , IV , D ) . 
B denotes the identification ( counted from 01 of a selected bead . 
N specifies whether to generate a new bead or not . If N equals to 0, no new be a dix generated . If N equals to 1, a new bead is generated . 
IV represents which language illtile selected b cad should be moved on t  . If W equals to 0 , one of the marginal sentences of tile first language should bc moved out  . Otherwise , one of tile marginal sentences of the second language should be moved out  . 
I ) represent shemoving direction .   0 denotes the left marginal sentence of the selected bead is moved left  , and 1 denotes the right marginal sent cnce of the selected bead is moved right  . 
For example , transition fim clion will transit a configuralion ( 1 , 2) ,  (1 , 1) ,  (1 , 1) ,  (1 , 21 ,  (1 , 1) to (1 , 2) , ( l , l ) , tO , l ) ,  (1 , 0) ,  (1 , 2) ,  (1 , 1)) according totile transition vector TV-(2 ,  1 , (1 , l ) . 
( s ) lOwrevI , ) mclion(E ): Assume each sentence has a weight , which is measured by tilen mnber of critical POSes  . The weight difference of a bead is the difference between the weighls of respective sentences in one bead  . The energy of a configuration is the sum of weight differences of all beads in a configuration  . 
(9) Annealing Sclwdule(AS ): When a new conti ~ , uu ' ation (" is generated , two alternatives are considered : move to the new configuration C ' or retaintile current configuration C '  . ' File criterion is if K(C ') <" E(C) , the new configuration is a doped . 
1 lowever , if exp(1?(C ) - .  1 , 2(C ')) > random 10 , 1 c:pk we , , viii also move Io the now confil , tlratmn . 
( ) the p , vise , the cllr rct lt configt lraliol l is retained . This is the wellknown Metropolis('rileri(m . The CPk is Ihc control parameter , which will be reduced gradually in tile a , mealing process . 
Now , we apply tile simulated annealing to aligning the texts  , CE01 to CE10 . Tile initial control parameter cpk is 1 . 0 and initial nm length Lk is I000 . 
Wc reduce the control parameter with 0 . 5% after each rim . Tile initial configuration is randomly generated . 
Wc conduct two cxp criments , 1) without using paragraph markers ; 2) with using paragraph markers .

Figure 1 . Comparison of Aligmnent PEr formance The correct rates without and with using paragraph markers are  78  . 9% and 94 . 4%, respectively . The latter result (94 . 4%) is better than the botm deor reclrate (91 . 8%) mentioned before . It shows that those difficult bead types are resolved in our approach  . 
Comparing Tables 5 and 6 , we conclude I hat when the paragraph markers are used  , the performance increases significantly . Fig . 1 shows the significance of paragraph markers . In other words , if an alignmenl algorithm could use any reliable anchor points in IhE texts  , the performance will incrE as E sharply . 
In fact , the pErl brmancc of alignm cnt is depcn denl on the naturc of the texts  . When aligning a noisy texts without rcliablc anchor points  , we will definitely do a bad job . However , the simulated annealing approach could reduce the risk  , and the performance will keep over 78% in our experiment . 
6. Conclusion
A new criterion to aligning texts is proposed in this paper  . The criterion is based on an observation that the source texts and thctarget texts should share the same concepts  , entities , ideas , and events . Sentence length ( no matter word-based or character-based )   ( Brown , el al . , 1991; Gale and Church , 1991a ) , is not so critical on languages across different language families  . Translation-based crilcrion ( Kay , 1991; ChErt , 1993) is very . uscfifl , butilisals overy complex . 
Surely , to decide word correspondences is difficull . 
Our criterion provides a tradcoff between the length-based criterion and the translation-based criterion  . 
The elucs of critical POSes are parlially syntactic and partially statislic ~ d  . 
ThE performance of simulated annealing approach to alignment is  94% in our Experiment , if we use the paragraph markers . Without paragraph marker , the value drops lo 78% . GEnerally speaking , it works well for languages across different language families  . 
The main conlribntion of lhis work is to provide an alignment algorithm for aligning oriental lang vages with occidental languages  . The fitture work should focus on the large experiment  , normalizing the weight of critical POSes and other search techniques  .
