A formal grammar accounting for artistic
abilities of a folk story teller is proposed  . 
This grammar comprises the following components :
I ) a grammar defining the set of formulae representing steps of text generation  ;  2 ) a list of " messages " underlying the texts of a folk-lore genre  ;  3 ) a list of " rules of embellish-ment " serving to attach artistic qualities to " messages " and intermediary steps of text generation  . 
I . Introduction
The best way for a researcher to present his knowledge of folklore is to demonstrate the ab ility to construct at least rough approximations of folk stories  . This should be done with all the techniques accessible to immediate observation and checking up  . We take the standpoint that at the deepest level of a text lie thematic elements which const it ute the " message " of the text  . " Rules of Embellish-ment " are applied to these elements and attach artistic qualities to them  . The analysis of a text is to be represented as a process of generating it by " Rules of Embellishment  . " These Rules are analogous to transformations in linguistics  . They are " message-preserving " devices serving to increase the expressive power of themes  . 
Every rule of embellishment is a parti-cular instance of some " principle of expressiveness  , " from the set of such " principles " proposed by ? u  . Shcheglov and A . Zholkovsky ( linguists and philoloqists who until recently worked in the USSR ~ ~ ore of their works see in the Bibliography in ~  . The refollows the list of the principles of expressiveness  . 
Embodiment ( EMBOD ) -a substitution of some more concrete and " v iv id " element X  1 for a more abstract element X . The element X 1 has all the properties of X plus some new feature  ( s )  . 
Examples : a man ? a carpenter ; a city ?
New York ; a nose ? a very bignose.
Amplification ( AMPLIF ) -a substitution of an " amplified " element X ! for a more " neutral " element X  . The amplification may be with respect to dimensions  , duration , degree , etc . 
Examples : deception ? treachery ; rape ? child-rape ; talent ? genius . 
Repetition ( REPET ) -a substitution of a series of nearly identical elements X  , X 1 .   .   .   .   . 
X n for an element X .

Examples : a door ? the first door , the second door , the third door .   .   .   . ; a waiter ? the first waiter , the second waiter .   .   .   . 
Variation ( VAR ) -a substitution of a series of substantial ly different elements XI  , X2 .   .   .   .   . Xn for an element X so that each one is the result of an EMBOD applied to X  . 
Examples : a man ? a carpenter , a student , a taxi-driver .   .   .   . ; a building ? a church , amosque, .   .   . 
Detailization ( DET ) -a substitution of a detailed description Y1 of a thing , situation or action Y , for Y . 
Examples : X is ill ? X stays in bed and X has no appetite and X has a high temperature  ; an old Jew dies ? an old Jewisn't well , other Jews come , they pray together , the Rabbi comes to visit the old Jew , the old Jew is dead and the body is carried to the cemetery  . 
Compare an EMBOD of ' X is ill '?' X has pneumonia ' Contrast  ( CONTR ) -a substitution of two contrasting elements X and Anti-X for an element ?  . 
Examples : death ? perfect health , death ; treachery ? loyalty , treachery . 
Exposition ( EXPO ) -a substitution of two elements pre-X and X for X  , where pre-X precedes X in the text ; pre-X may be : a ) incomplete X ( the shadow of X appears and then X itself )   ; b ) the felt absence of X ( everybody is waiting for X , then X appears ); c ) Anti-X followed by X . The only difference between this case and CONTR is the order of 
Anti-X and X .
Adjustment ( ADJ ) - of X to Y with respect to a feature f : X 1 is substituted for X , where X1 has all the essential properties of X , plus some feature f of an element Y occurring in the derivation of a text  . 
Examples : touch(X ) , love(Y ); Xl = embrace ; house(X ) , many people meet(y );
X 1 = club.
Amalgamation ( AMALG ) -ofX with Y-a substitution of an element Z for X and Y where Z is the result of EMBODs applied both to X and 

Examples : death(X ) , love (?) ; Z = roman-ticsuicide ; presence ( X ) , absence ( Y ) , Z = a person in disguise . 
Reduction ( RED ) - a substitution of X1 for X , where X 1 is such a part of X that all the thematically important information contained Examples : M  . Dayan ? one-eyed Israeli Minister ; murder + a blood-stained knife ; Jewish religion ? a Torahscroll ; communism ? The Red Banner . Compare EMBOD : Jewish religion ? orthodox Jewish religion  ; communism ? Chinese communism . 
It seems to us that the most important innovations of Shcheglov and Zholkovsky are ADJ and AMALG  . The hypothesis that these princi-ples are employed in the construction of literary texts means the presence of intensive links between text elements  . Let us give a simple example of the intensifi cation of such links  . Consider a " theme " I . A person X uses an object Y to injure a per song who uses an object d for aggressive purposes  . We shall establish links between some elements of this text  . First , we shall declare Y and d to be the same object : 2  . A person X uses an objects to injure a per song who injures others with this very objects  . Now we shall establish a link between g and s . Let's makes a sort of RED(g ): 3 . A person X uses an objects , which is used for aggression by g and is inherently typical of g  , to injure g . This quasi-text has obvious artistic qual ities and may be interpreted  , for example , as : 4 . The hero causes the situation where the Dragon bites itself with its venomous teeth  . 
"k " k
Some applications and specifications of the above ideas follow  . 
We were looking for the answers to questions like : What are creative abilities of folk lore story-tellers ? What are poetic systems of different folk lore genres ? As the firs to bject of our investigation we have chosen sacred legends of Moroccan Jews  . 
To make the " Principles of Expressiveness " technically workable  , we represent steps of text generations by formulae of a formal language devised especially for this purpose  . 
So analyzing a given text ( alegend ) -re-written in our formal language-means construction of a minimal sequence of formulae of this language so that : I  . The last formula is an approximation of a given text  . 
2 . One or more formulae of the sequence are themes ( " messages " )  . 
3 . Every formula Q4 , which is nota " message " , is obtainable with an application of a rule of embellishment from one or more formulae Qj  , j < i . 
This resembles a proof of a theorem , where a " message " is a sort of axiom , Rules of Embellishment are rules of inference , and a text is a theorem to be proved . By the set of possible " messages " and Rules of Embellishment  , the set of all possible texts ( i . e .   , the genre of Moroccan Jewishs acred legends ) is given as the set of all provable theorems of our calculus  . 
2. Well-Formed Formulae
We present below a grammar of the contextfree language defining the set of all well-formed sentences  ( formulae ) used to represent steps in the generation of sacred legends  . The wellformedness is understood as a purely syn -tactical feature  , 
Rule I.

Here #~ a terminal boundary symbol , ~ means " then " , " and after that " , * is Kleene's star operator ; the parentheses are neither terminal nor nonterminal symbols  , they only mean that the sequence > < t-section > is to be repeated as a whole  , At-section represents an event . For example we may obtain with the Rule I : #< t -section >> < t-section >> < t-section > # 
Rule 2.
< t-section >? < sign > (< t-section >)
Rule 3.
< sign > ? + I-I = I ~
The sign+marks an event which is good for the Jews  ; the sign-marks an event which is bad for the Jews  ; the sign = marks an event which is particula rlybad for the Jews  ; an event with is neither bad nor good for the Jews  , but implies a hope or a possibility for the good  , 
Rule 4.
< t-section > ? ( < t-section > ( ~ < t-section > ) * ) Here the inner pair of parentheses is used as in Rule I  . The siqn ~ is used to say that two or more events are amalgamated :  ( a ~ b ) is one event which is an AMALG for two events a and b  ; ~ Qb ~ c ) means that three events , a , b , and c are amalgamated into one , etc . More about the amalgamation of events will be said below  . 
Rule 5.
< t-section > ? STAT(<t-section >)
The operator STAT can make any event into a " stat ive " event  . A stative event is , in a way , timeless . STAT makes a lasting situation out of an event  . For example , STAT ( xlosesy ) may mean " x has lost y " , or else " x would usually lose y " . 
An action in the scope of STAT loses in part its usual consequences  ( a crime against the Jews performed under STAT is not punished  , for example ) . Protagonists involved in actions under STAT may be more general than outside the example  )  . That is , a term in the scope of STAT may not undergo an EMBOD affecting its occur-ences in the rest of the formula  . 
Rule 6.
< t-section >+ STEP (< t-section >)
The operator STEP makes a partial event from a complete one  . For example , STEP ( x comes ) may be understood as " xknocks at the door " , or else " x is seen through the window " , etc . In this case , STEP ( STEP ( x comes ) ) may be understood as " x is unclearly ( or partially ) seen through the window " . 
Rule 7.
< t-section > ? QUASl(<t-section >)
The operator QUASI is used to designate a symbol i corritual counterpart of an event  . For example , QUAS l ( The army occupies the city ) may be " The army leader receives the keys of the city "  . 
Rule 8.
< t-section >?< adverb >(< t-section >)
Rule 9.
< adverb > ? MIRIANTIINOT
MIR means " miraculously " ; ANTI means " opposite to .   .   . "; NOT may be understood as negation . 
Rule I0.
< t-section >? < predicate expression > ( & < predi-cate expression > ) A more complex event is represented as an unordered set of simpler events  . 
Rule II.
< predicate expression >+ < sign > ( < predicate expression > ) 
Rule 12.
< predicate expression > ?< adverb > ( < predicate expression > ) 
Rule 13 , < predicate expression > ? DISTRESSED ( < e~rm > ) lTRY ( < e~rm , < t-section >) IDESTROY(<e~m > , < e~rm>)lFalk(~e~m > , <t-section> ) IPROSELYTIZED ( <~e~m> ) l GUILTY ( < e>t----<rm > ) IkOSE ( <e~-<rm> , < e > ~-< m >) INEG kECT , (< e~rm > , < e ~) IUSE(<e ~ , < e~rm>)IFIND(<e~m > , < ~- er ~<>) ICARE gOR(<e > ~- ~ rm > , < e>t----<rm>')ll NaURE(<e ~----< rm > , < e~rm >) ICAUSE(<t-section > , < t-section >) IGIVEBACK(<e ~ rm > , < e~rm >) IPRAISE(<e ~ rm > , < e~rm >) IREVENGE(<e ~ rm > , < e~rm >) IRESPECT(<e ~> , < e ~) IRESTORE (< e~rm > , < e~rm >) IMIS APPROPRIATE(<e ~ rm > , < e~rm >) IABASE(<e ~ m > , < e~m >) IDEFIkE(<e ~ m > , < e~m >) lDISABLE(<e ~ rm > , < e~rm >) IPETRIFY(<e ~ , < e~rm>)lINATTACK(<e ~---< rm > , <e~---<rm>)ICURE(<ee~> , <e~-<rm> ) lCANCELED ( <t-section> ) IACTI6N ( <te~rm> ) IKILL ( < eee ~ m > , <e~e~-<m>)IPROHIBIT(<e~----<rm> , < t-section >) lPROTECT(<t>T-rm ~ , <ee~m> ) ISTARVED ( < t ~> < ) lDAMAGED ( <e>t-----<rm> ) IBL IND ( < e~m > , < e~m >) IPRESENT(<e ~> , < e ~> , < e ~>) IMAKESEE(<e ~ rm > , < e~rm > ) DISTRESSED ( x ) is a state or an event which is bad for x with respect to material  , moral or physical conditions . PROSELYTIZED ( x ) means that x imposes on himself , partially or com-pletely , the laws of the Jewish religion , GUILTY ( x ) is a state of x which is punishable by the author ities for an offence against them  . 
USE(x , y ) is a typical , normal relation between human x and a thing y , y being conceived ex-clusively as a means of x ' swell-being  . The exact nature of this relation depends on x and y  . For example , x be inq a community and y saint's shrine , USE becomes visiting and praylng , asking for help , being cured , etc . INJURE(x , y ) is x's doing any harm to y . CAUSE(A , B ) means : the event A happens and involves the event B  . 
RESTORE(x , y ) means liquidation of the consequences of x's injuring y  . DISABLE and PETRIFY are two forms of paralys is , the first one par-tial , the second one complete . INATTACK(x , y ) is involuntary injuring y by x . CANCELED ( A ) means : all the consequences of the event A become nonexistent  . MAKESEE(x , y ) means that x causes the blindy to see . 
Rule 14.

The symbol over a term may be rewritten as ~-~ , ~_mean For a term x the expressions T , respectiyely , that the occurrence of a predicate , with x ,  ~ , x fill-ingup a slot , is bad for x , good for x , or involves a hope for the good for x . > < may also be omitted . 
This rule can be easily rewritten in a contextfree form  , without diacritical marks and the possibi lity of a mark deletion  . ( A change in the Rule 13 is also needed . )
Rule 15.
< term >? < variable feature > ( ~<feature> ) * l < feature > (  , < feature > ) The asterisk occurring between features is a terminal symbol and should not be confused with 
Kleene's star operator.
Rule 16.
< variable feature > ? xI\]x2Ix 3.....
Rule 17.
<feature >? < simple feature > l < functor feature > I < negative feature > 
Rule 18.
< simple feature > ? THINGISY MBOLIHUMANISINGLEI GROUPIVAL OBJICARPETIJIAISPICOMIMONEYIMOSQUE ISYNAGOGUEIFOOD\]MALEIFE MALEJSIMPLE IIMPORTANT POORtREL AISECAIRABBIIITZHAKIPINTOIKADIl SHEIKIKINGITROUBLEDIILLIFEVEREDISTERILEI 

SYMBOL is an important object which has some ideological value for a community  . VALOBJ is a valuable object without ideological importance  . 
Jmeans Jewish . Ameans Arabic . SP is an object possessing sacred power . CON means commun-ity . VERIMP means a very important person . 
RELA is religious authority . SECA is secular authority . TROUBLED means introuble . HYPOCRITE means " pretending to be a friend of the Jews "  . 
ITZHAK and PINTO are proper names of typical
Je wish rabbis.
Rule 19.
<functor feature > + GRAVE ~ < simple feature > ( * < simple feature > )   ) \[SHRINE ( < simple feature > (  , < simple feature >) ~) ISON (< simple feature > ( , < simple feature >) ~) IWIFE (< simple feature > ( , < simple feature >)*) l
DAUGHTER ( csimple feature > ( , < simple feature >) ~) IPROPERT y(<simple fature >( , < simple feature >) ~)
Rule 20.
< negative feature > ?#(< simple feature > ( , < simple feature > ) * ) A term including a negative feature is characterized by the negation of at least one simple feature included in the given negative feature  . 
A term corresponds , generally , to an object characterized by the conjunction of the nonnegative features which it is composed of  . For example,
MALE*SINGLE , SHEPHERD*# ( RICH*ILL ) means : " A ( male ) shepherd who is either not rich or not ill , or else is neither rich norill " . 
3. The Messages
I .  # - ( DISTRESSED ( J * ~ ) ) ~ + ( ACTION ( J*RELA ) )> + ( ANTI ( DISTRESSED ( J * ~ ) ) ) # 2 . #-( INJURE(HUMAN * A , J )) ~+ ( MIR(PROTECT@ , SP , ~) ) ) # 3 . #-( INJURE(HUMAN , Aj )) ~+ ( HIP(REVENGE(J*SP , HUMAN * A ))) #4 . #-( INJURE(HUMAN * A , J )) > +( HIP(REVENGE(J , SP , FFOI~TAN , ~))) >+ ( RESPECT(A , ~))>+( MIR(RESTORE(J , SP , ~)))#
The wellformedness of the above four messages can be easily verified  . Using the informal semantics given above with the formal syntactical rules of our language  , we can read , for example , the second message approximately as follows : " A human Arab agent  ( HUMAN , A ) injures a Je wish object ( J) , which is bad for the Jews ( the event is marked by minus )  , and after that ( > ) a Jewish bearer of Sacred Power ( J * SP ) miracu-lously ( MIR ) protects the ( above ) Jewish object , which is good for the Jews ( marked by plus ) . " The above messages can be developed into separate stories  . But a subset of them can be also " a malgamated " to a single story by the appropriate rule of embellishment  . 
4. The " Rules of Embellishment."
These rules are the central part of our grammar . There are many of them ; we cannot present here more than several typical examples taken from our technical reports  ( see 2 )  . The set of possible objects ( protagonists and things ) of the legends is described in 2 by a network grammar : a possible object is an unordered set of features picked up from the arcs of the network by moving from the initial state to a final state  . Asterisks are inserted between the features . Examples : the term HUMAN , SINGLE , VERIMP , RELA*J*SP*MALE can be understood as " A Jewish Saint "  ; the term THING*SINGLE*SYMBOL*A*GRAVE ( HUMAN*SINGLE*VERIMP*RELA * A * MALE * KADI ) can be read as " the grave of an Arab Kadi . " The same network serves to EMBOD terms : to any set of features which belong to a path in the network we may add any set of features which belong to the same path  . So , for example , HUMAN , GROUP?HUMAN , GROUP , A , SIMPLE , MALE ( " people "? " some Arabs " ) is a rule of embodiment for terms by virtue of the fact that there is a path in the network to which both the lefthand set of features and the righthand set belon q  ( see the network in 2pp .  1518 ; the report 2 is to be distri-buted among the participants of  COLING-80  )  . 
NB : Any rule of embodiment , when chosen , is to be applied to every occurrence of the expression I for exampie  , the term ) which is to be substituted for . There are complications , for example , with EMBOD of RESPECT , but we shall not deal with them here . 
By a rule of such kind we can obtain , for example , from the second message the following formula : #  -  ( INJURE ( HUMAN*A*VERIMP , SlMPLE*J )) > +( MIR(PROTECT(J*SP , SIMPLE*J)))# . 
The following rule is an example of EMBOD for predicate expressions : IN JURE  ( HUMAN , A , HUM ~) ? MISAPPROPRIATE(HUMAN ,  ~ , PROPERTY(HUMAN*J )) . 
The applicability of such rules is conceived so as to make possible the application of this rule to the above formula  ( cf . 2, pp . 
2932) , with the following result : -162 #- ( MIS APPR OPRIATE ( HUMAN * A * VERIMP , PROPERTY ( SIMPLE * HUMANa ) ) )  > + ( MIR ( PROTECT ( J*SP , 
SIMPLE * J ))) #.
The feature HUMAN ( which is , in our grammar , predictable by the feature SIMPLE ) can be introduced to the last term by obligatory ADJ to SIMPLE * HUMAN  , J ( which is considered an immediate descendant of SIMPLE  , J ) , with the result : #-( MISAPPROPRIATE(HUMAN , A , VERIMP , PROPERTY(SIMPLE , HUMAN*J ))) > +( MIR(PROTECT(J*SP , 

So the identity of the Jewish protagonist is restored  , Now we can amalgamate the above formula with the third message  . This is the simplest case of AMALG : the two chains of events are mixed up to produce one chain comprising all the events  . This is done under control of the ( thematic ) principle prescribing that all " minus-events " precede all " plus-events ":#-  ( INJURE ( HUMAN*A , J )) ~-( MISAPPROPRIATE(HUMAN*A*VERIMP , PROPERTY(SIMPLE*HUMAN*J ))) > +( MIR(REVENGE(J , SP , HUM ~))) > +( MIR(PROTECT(J*SP , 

Now , we do not need two different villains . 
One villain will do : we can polish the formula by ADJ of the term HUMAN  , A to the term HUMAN , A , VERIMP . This optional adjustment is a specific case of EMBOD : an expression is EMBODed so as to become similar  ( in the limit case-identical ) to another expression of the operand formula . 
So we obtain : #-( INJURE(HUMAN * A * VERIMP , J )) ~-( MISAPPROPRIATE(HUMAN*A*VERIMP , PROPERTY(SIMPLE*HUMAN*J )))+ ( MIR(REVENGE(J*SP , HUMAN*A*VERIMP ))) ~+ ( MIR(PROTECT(J*SP , SIMPLE * HUMAN*J ))) # . 
The term J of the first t-section can under q o an analoqous operation  , and now we shall have only one Je wish protagonist in the story  ( a " SIMPLE " one ) : #- ( INJURE ( HUMAN , A , VERIMP , J , SIMPLE * HUMAN ) ) > - ( MIS APPR OPRIATE ( HUMAN * A * VERIMP , PROPERTY(SIMPLE , HUMAN , J ))) >+( MIR(REVENGE(J*SP , HUMAN*A*VERIMP ))) > +( MIR(PROTECT(J , SP , SIMPLE *

Two different acts of ' ~ n juring " can be amalgamated to one by the follow in  9 rule : two different t-sections X and Y such that Y can be obtained from X by rules of EMBOD  , can be a malgamated by dropping X . Now Y serves to represent both X and itself . By applying this rule to the above formula , we obtain : #-( MISAPPROPRIATE(HUMAN , A , VERIMP , PROPERTY(SIMPLE*HUMAN*J ))) > +( MIR(REVENGE(J , SP , HUMAN*A*VERIMP ))) > +( MIR(PROTECT(J*SP , SIMPLE , 

Now , one can amalgamate the SP's acts of revenge and protection  , with the result : #-( MISAPPROPRIATE(TIUMAN , A * VERIMP , PROPERTY ( SIMPLE * HUMAN*J ) ) )  ~ + ( MIR ( REVENGE ( J * SP , HUMAN*A*VERIMP )) ~ MIR(PROTECT(J*SP , S'i MPLE *

This formula can be read as follows : " A human Arab agent belonging to the highest social stratum misappropriates a property of a Jewish person of low status  . After that an event occurs which is at the same time an act of Je wish Saint's revenge with respect to the Arab  , and an act of this Saint's protection with respect to the Jew  . " This story still needs an interpretation , but we think that even at this stage the above text possesses some artistic potential accumulated in the process of its derivation from the themes  ( messages )  . A rough interpretation of this text could run as follows : " The Sheikmisap propriates a valuable thing belonging to a Jewish shoemaker  ( or carpet-maker )  , and the Rabbi causes this thing to return miraculously to its legal possessor 
In a way which damages the Sheik."
A more delicate interpretation can give us something like : "  .   .   . them is appropriated carpet ( in the case of a carpet-maker , with an appropriate ADJ ) miraculously returns to its possessor carrying the frightened Sheik on it  .  "
Orelse : " .   .   . the misappropriated pair of shoes ( in the case of a shoemaker , with an appropriate ADJ ) miraculously returns to its possessor carrying the Sheik wearing them  . "
Such interpretations are beyond the capabilit ies of our grammar  , but ( we hope ) not far beyond the capabilities of grammars of the kind proposed  . 
Interpretations for simpler cases of
AMALG for events are easily achievable technical ly  , for example : ( INJURE(A , J ) ~ INJURE(HAWKER , SHEPHERD )) ?
INJURE(A , HAWKER , J , SHEPHERD ), etc.
Amalgamated events are usually good for the Jews.
Events which happen to be good for the Arabs are simple  , trivial . Let us take no wone more example , rather typical for our material : .   .   . ~+( INJURE(SP , SIMPLE * A )) >+ ( INJURE(SP,
VERIMP * A )) > ...

Amalgamating injuries with two different persons injured is a typical artistic device in Moroccan Jewishs acred legends  . At present , we only assume the " intention " of a story-tel ler  ( or a story author ) to amalgamate the above events : .   .   . ~+( INJURE(SP , SlMPLE , A)~IN JURE(SP,
VERIMP , A )) > ...
Now , how is this aim achieved ? Typical
Je wish legend uses a technicality which may be called Deposite  . Deposite is a thing or a person related to authorities but temporarily under the responsibi lity of a " simple " person  . 
In juring a deposite means in juring both the " simple " person and the " very important " person involved  . In the story analyzed in 2 the deposite is the Sheik's son . In another story the role of a deposite is played by a gift  ( of a group of " simple " Arabs to the

The amalgamated character of SP actions is so typical of our legends that it may be conceived as nearly thematical  . In general , an optional artistic device can move to the thematic sphere and become obligatory  . It is nearly so in the case under discussion where the amalgamation around an SP action is preferable  , though a concrete realization of the operator ~ leaves considerable freedom to a story-tel ler  . 
There follow more examples of rules of embellishment  . 
#s(a )> + #s(STAT(s(a )))
Here s is a sign . This rule serves to turn the opening event of a story to the exposition  , a standing situation which is to become the background for the rest of events  . 
> s(a ) #? ~ s(STAT(s(a ))) #
This is an analogous rule for the transformation of the last event to the coda  , the epilogue of a story . 
There follow two rules for EMBOD of STEP :
STEP(a ) ? QUASI(a ) s(STEP(s(aI&a2& .   .   . & ak ))) + s(ai ) ( i = l , or i = 2 .   .   .   .   . or i = k ) The last rule is a way to EMBOD an EXPO for a set of events : an event from the set occurs  . 
Now we shall present a rule of EXPO ( which exists in three different forms ) : >- ( T )  >4> -  ( TRY ( - t - , -( T ))) >-( T ) #-( T ) > + #-( TRY (-- , -(T ))) >-( T ) > +( T ) >?>-( TRY('t- , +( T ))) > , ( T ) TAeab overule works for at-section T where t appears in the first place of the highest predicate of T which does not appear immediately after ANTI or NOT  ; otherwise Y should appear in the first place of the highest predicate  . 
Example : the expression .   .   . ~+( ANTI(DISTRESSED(HUM ~))) ~ .   .   . 
can be transformed by the above rule to .   .   . ~~( TRY ( ROMAN ~ J , + ( ANTI ( DISTRESSED ( HUM ~ ) ) ) ) )  + ( ANTI ( DISTRESSED ( FF~- ) ) ) >  .   .   . 
An example of AMPLIF ( or CONTR , or rather
AMPLIF by CONTR ):-( PROHIBIT(A , +( P(tI ))) ~+>-( PROHIBIT(A , +  ( P ( tl )   )   )   ) ~ - ( P ( a ) )~ Here P ( tl ) is a predicate expression with a term ~ I in its first place  ( or the only place )  . 
The t-section P ( A ) is obtained by substituting the term corresponding to A  ( an a ~ ab_agent ) for tI in P ( t )  , and changing any tilt I to ti . 
This is an AMPLIF for prohibition : an Arab agent not only prohibits t's doing P  , but does Phimself ( or herself ) . Example: .   .   . >-( PROHIBIT(A*VERIMP , +( USE(SIMPLE * J , J * SYMBOL )))) ~ . . . +  . . . >-( PROHIBIT(A*VERIMP , +( USE(SIMPLE * J , J*SYMBOL )))) >-( USE(A , VERIMP , 
J * SYMBOL )) p . . ,
The principle of CONTR is exemplified also by the following rule : s  ( TRY ( -t- , T )) ? s(TR?(-t- , T )) > FAIL(t , T ) , where s is a sign , t is a term and T is at-section . 
Many other rules of embellishment , amon ~ them some more sophisticated ones , see in 2Some transformations , which we call Formal Equivalences , do not contribute to expressiveness , but serve only to improve readability of a formula and to facilitate implementation of the Rules of Embellishment  . There are rules eliminating adverbial expressions : so  ( ANTI ( si ( ABASE ( tl , t2)))) ? So(PRAISE(tl , t2)) or elses o(ANTl(sl(DISaBkE(tl , t2)))) + so(CURE(tl , t2)); there are rules dealing with signs :
NOT(-(T )) ?+( NOT(-(T ))) or else
So(So(T )) ? So(T ), and many others.
Here so and sI are signs , tI and t2 are terms , and Tisat-section . 
5. The Final Example.
We present below a typical Moroccan Jewish sacred legend-the text and the final step of a rather lengthy derivation representing an analysis of the legend in our grammar  . This is a very rough approximation of the Text . The -164 derivation see in 2 The formula is obtained from the " messages " i and  4  . 
HOWAHOLYJEWISH TOMBWASDISCOVERED
Once the Arabs of Teluat near Marrakesh built a fence around their graveyard  . In this graveyard was buried a great and learned rabbi  . 
The Arabs did not know of this , for in the village in which the graveyard was situated there were only Arabs  , and no Jews at all . 
One night one of the women of the villaged reamed that a mandressed in a long white shirt and with along white beard came to her  . He said to the woman : " In the morning inform the men of the burial society of the Jews in the neighbouring to wn that their rabbi  , who is buried in the Moslem graveyard in the vil lage  , has no peace . "" Ir is just a dream , " said the woman to herself . But the dream was repeated . Again the woman said : " It is just adream . "But when the dream was repeated for the third time  , she knew that the dream spoke truly to her . 
On the following days he went to the town to tell about her dream  . 
The men of the burial society came to the sheik of T the village and said to him : " Our  , ~ rabbi is buriediny Qurgrave yard . Permit us to seek out the place . We shall pay you much money if you will allow us to build over the grave a place for prayer  . "" Good , " thesheik agreed . 
The menOf the burial society sought and sought but they found nothing  . The son ~' the sheik began to get angry and began to durse them and & ay : " What are you looking for ~ pre ? Arab biw who die da hundred years ago ? " He turned aside to  , ,ease himself b~tHe fence , and then suddenly hestood like-ast one , paralysed . 
When the men of the burial society who were already getting ready to go back to the town saw the sheik's sonstanding like : astone statue  , they understood : Here was the grave of the rabbi . 
The Arabs asked : " What shall we do with , the sheik's son ? The sheik will kill us if , -he hears that his son has become paralysed . """ Break down the fence !" the men of the burial society commanded  . And straight away the Arabs broke down the fence . 
Then they drew a circle about the spot where the sheik's son was standing  , ,took stones and wrote upon i t " A holy ~ e~i , shgrave " . 
Then the sheik'ss on began to move , ~ is limbs and move from the place . " Where am I ? " heasked . "What has happened tome ?

We shall informally describe some artistic features of this legend which we tried to account for by our analysis  . 
The discovery of the holy grave is preceded by attempts to find it  . This is not a simple repetition which is characteristic of fairy tales  (  "  .   .   . tried once and did not succeed , tried the second time and did not succeed , tried the third time and succeeded . . . ") . In our legend the failure is to be taken more seriously : the Jews acknowledged the defeat and were ready to leave the graveyard  . A professional story writer ( for example , a detective story writer ) would not ignore such a device : the detective t ries to find the decisive evidence  , admits his failure ( for example , calls to the police office : " Nothing of interest !"  ) and then-by accident-finds the desired object  . In our story , too , the discovery is accidental . It does not result from any additional effort by the Jews  . More than that , it is caused by a hostile action . 
The punitive action by SP ( the Sheik'ss on being petrified ) creates a knot of entangled events ; in fact , one event which comprises different actions . The petrification is , at the same time , the discovery of the holy grave by the Jews ( no separate action of finding is involved )  . The petrification means that the Jews have found the holy grave  , T t is a sign of the holy grave being here . More than that : the Sheik'ss on being pet~ied means danger for the group of Arabs who are responsible for his peaceful return home  . The Arab community is punished by endangering a representative group of Arabs  ( " officials " )   . The last component of the complex event under consideration is the Sheik's son's being turned to a sort of stone  , a sort of statue . The symbolic significance of this act was recognized not only by us but also by some students  , including those of Moroccan Jewish origin : petrifying the Sheik's son is a symbolic counterpart of erecting a monument on the holy grave  . The Sheik's sonisforced to erect a sort of monument with his own body  . Thus an action which is to be performed by the Jewish community is in fact performed  ( in symbolic form ) by a hostile agent . This is a manifestation of a principle which the whole story is per-meated with : plus-actions are regularly performed by the potential or actual enemy-the Arabs  . The Rabbi appears in the dream to an Arabwoman . It is up to her to inform the Jewish community of the problem which has ari-senl  . The symbolic monument is firsterected with the Sheik's son's body  . The Arabs themselves troy the wall around the cemetery  , not just permitting the Jews to do so . The Arabsen circle the holy grave , to designate its exterritoriality in the Arab grave yard  . 
They thene rect a temporary monument with some stones  . Finally , the Arabs build the proper monument .
