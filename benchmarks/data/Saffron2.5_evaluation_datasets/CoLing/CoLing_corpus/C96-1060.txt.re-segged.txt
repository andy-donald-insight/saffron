This paper examines the discourse fluic-tions that different types of subjects perform in Italian within the centering framework  ( Groszel ; al . , 1995) . I build on my previous work ( Digugenio ,  1990 ) that accounted for the alternation of null and strong prottouns in subject position  . 
I extend my previous atialys is in several wws : for exam I  ) le , I refine the notion of CONTINUE altd discuss the centering functions of full NPs  . 
1 Introduct ion hiterpreting referential expressions is importatl t for any large coverage NL system  ; while such systems do exist for Italian , e . g . ( Stock et al , 1993; Lombardo and Lesmo ,  1994) , to my knowledge not mudi attention has been devoted to the interpretation of Italian referential expressions  . Some exceptions are ( Samek-Lodovici and Strapparava ,  1990) , that discusses interpretation of referential expressions within dialogues to access a video disconItalimiart  ; ( Not and Zancanaro ,  1995) , that adopts a systemic gra , nmar approadi ( Halliday , 1976); and ( Di Eugenio ,  1990) , which uses centering theory ( Grosz et al ,  1995 ) to account for the alternation of null and strong subjects  . 
hit his paper , I build on and expand ( Di Eugenio , 1990) in several ways . First , I reanalyz c the hypotheses I proposed earlier with respectoa corl  ) uS of naturally occurring data I show that those hypotheses are basically supported  , i  The examples in ( Di Euge . nio , 199)) were constructed . 
and that when they aren't an elegant explmia-tion can be found by looking at a two member sequence ofce  , ttering tra , tsitions rather than at just () tie transition . Second , I extend my previous analysis by also discussing the centering functions of full NPs in subject position  , and some occurrences of pronotuistui accounted for by centering  . 
2 Centering theory
Centering the . ory ( Grosz et al , 1986; Brennanctal . , 1987; Grosz et al , 1995) models local coher-e . nee in discourse : it keet ) strack of how local focus varies from one utterance to the next  .   ( \] entering postulates that : ~* Each utterance Unhas associated with it a set of discourse ntities  , the FOH . WAII)-LOO<IN(~CEN-TERS or Cfs . The C f list is ranked according to discourse salience  . 
-The IACK WARD-LOOKIN ( \] CENTEI ~ or Cb ~ ix the tmember of the Cf list that lJ  , ~ most centrally concerns ~ att d that links U ~ to the previous discourse  . 
* Finally , the PI % EFERI . EDCENTEI , or Cp : is the highestrauked member of the Of list  . The Cp represents a prediction about die Cb of the following utterance  . 
Transitions between two adjacent utterances U , >_I and U , ~can be characterized as a function of looking backward whether Cb  ( Un ) is the same as Cb ( Un 1 ) -att do flooking forward whether Cb ( Ur  ~ ) is the same as Cp ( U , ~) . Table 1 illustrates the Pour transitions that are detined according to diese constraints  . ( Brennan et al ,  1987 ) proposes a default ordering on transitions which correlates with discourse coherence : CONTINUE is preferred to RETAIN is prelbrred to SMOOTH-SHIFT is  pre-2The version of centering I presem ; here is ti ' om ( Brennan et al ,  1987) .

This paper is a contribution in that dire . orion.
3 The Italian pronominal system
Italian has two pronominal systems ( CabJ ) rese , 1986): weakl ) ronouns , th ; t t i I lust always be c . liti-cized to the verb ( e . g . Io , le , gli-respeetiw : ly him , accusative ; them , feminine accusative or her , dative . ; him , dative ) , and strong t ) ronouns (\[ ui , tei , them ) . 4 The null subject is considered part of the system of weak pronouns  . 
Weak and strong pronouns are often in complementary distribution  , as strong pronouns have to be used in prepositional phrases  , e . g . perlui , for him . However , this syntactic alternation doesn'tapl ) ly in subject position . The choice of null ver-sits strong pronoun de . ponds on pragmatic factors ; the centering explanation offered in ( Di Eugenio , 1990) goes as follows : (3a ) Typically , an ltll subject signals a CONTINUE , & lida strong pronotina RE'FAIN or a SIIFT . 
(3b ) A null subject can be felicitously used in eases of RETAIN or SHIFT if in U  , ~ the syntactic context tipto and including the verbal form  ( s ) carrying tense and/or agreement forces the null subject to refer to a particular referent and not to Cb  ( U , ~ l ) -The evidence for ( 3b ) provided in ( Di Eug ( > nio , 1990) derived , among others , from modal and control verb constructions , in which clitics may be clitieized to the infinitival complement of the higher verb or may climb in front of the higher verb  . Wheu the clitic climbs , certain pronomiual " garden path " effects , deriving from a wrong interpretation initially assigned to the nulls libject and later retracted  , are avoided . 
4Italian subjects in discourse 4 . 1 The corpus The corpus amounts to about 25 pages of text , and 12 , 000 words ; it is composed of excerpts from two books ( yonArnim , 1989; Fallaci ,  1989) , a letter ( Mila ,  1993) , a posting on the Italian bulletinboard ( SCI ,  1994) , a short story ( Nichetti ,  1993) , and three articles from two newspapers ( del Buono , 1993; Pagetti , 1993; La Nazione ,  1994) . 
The excerpts are of different lengths , with the ex-cerI ) tS from the two books being the longest . 
Texts were chosen to cover a variety of contemporary written Italian prose  , from formal ( newspaper articles about politics mid literature )  , to informal ( posting on the Italian bulletin board )  , and according to the following criteria : a ) , ninimal direct speech , which has not been addresse diucen-4kui , lei , I or o are the oblique forms of the strong system , while the nonfinative \[ brms are respectively egN  , ella , essi/e:incurrent Italian the latter forms are rarely used as the oblique forms have replaced them in subject position in my corpus there are only four occurrences of these nominative forms  , and they all occur ii ~ the same article ( Pagetti ,  1993) . 
tering yet ; b ) prose that describe situations involving several animate refe  , rents , bee , a use strong t ) ronouns can refer only to animate referents . 
Table 2 shows the distrit ) ution of animate third person subjects partitioned into : full NPs the numbers in parentheses refer to possessive NPs  ; strong pronouns ; null subje( ; tsI counted only those whose antecedents are not determined by contra indexing constraints  ( Chomsky ,  1981) . ; other anaphors ( e . g . tutte , all I ~ , , , ) they won't be analyzed in this pat)er . 
4.2 Issues
When applying (: entering to real text , one realizes that lnany issues have , ll Ot been solved yet . I will comment here on how deictics , possessives , and subordinate clauses affect centering . 
Deictics such its I , you , etc . The problem is whether they are part of the Cf list or not  . If ollow ( Walker ,  1993 ) in assuming that deictics are always available as part of global h  ) cus , and therefore are outside centering . 
Possessives . Table 3 includes a category marked possessive , which refers to hill NPs that in chtdea possessive adjective referring to an animate entity  , such as isuo is for zi-his cf for ts . 
The problem is how possessives affect Cb computation and C fordering  . While Cb computation does not appear to be affected by a possessive  , that behaves like ai ) ronoun , the Cf rank in gueeds to be modified . An NP of type possessive refers to two entities , the possessor Po ,  . and the possessed P~d . P  ~ , d corresponds to the full NP , and thus its position in Cf is determined by the NP's grammatical flmction  ; as regards P , , . , my working heuristics is to rank it as i in mediately preceding P~d if P~d is inanimate  , as immediately following P ~ . ~t if P~d is animate . Such heuristics appears to work , t ) ut needs to be rigorously test e . d . 
Subordinates . Another important issue , that has not been extensively addressed ye . t-but see ( Kameyama , 1997; Snri and McCoy ,  1993 ) is how to deal with complex sentences that include coordinates and subordinates  . The questions that arise concern whether there are independent Cb's and Cf lists for every clause  ; if not , how the Cb of the complex sentence is computed , and how semantic entities appearing in different clauses are ordered on the global Cf list  . 
In this paper , I will loosely adopt Kmneyama's proposal ( 1997 ) that sentences containing con-jtlncts and tensed adjuncts are broken down iii to a linear sequence of centering " units "  , while tense--~ii-Arnim , 1989) ( Falbmi , 1989) ( Mila , 1993) ( sc , I , ~994) ( Nichet Li , 1993) (( h ' . l Buono , 1993) ( Pago . t , t;i , 1993) ( LaNa . zione , 1994)
