In this paper , we show that Reileralion and Collocation relations as introduced I  ) y Ilalliday and llas an may function as lexieally I  ) iased discourse structure relations and that these relations are well represented by sequences of Mel ' & flds Lexical Funclions  ( Ll , ' s ) . We propose to use Lie sequences for tl , efinal determination and realization of discourse organization during lexical choice in text generation  . 
1 LEXICAL PHENOMEN AIN DIS-
COURSE 1.1 The Problem
In text generation , the tmsk of content selection and discourse organization  , i . e . text phuming , has often been opposed to the task of linguistic realization  ( ) 1" the information selected and organized by the text planning process  ( el . , e . g . , MeKeown and Swartout , 1987) . 
However , discourse organization is not possibh ' , without taking into account linguistic means that are available to express a particular meaning  ( el . , e . g . , Meteer , 1992; Rubinoff , 1992) . Esl)e . eially the \[' allure to integrate lexical choice into the phuming process may lead to monotonous  , awkward , or even ungrammati-cal text ( note that when used separately , the clauses in ( Ix ) and ( 2a ) are fully acceptable ) : '  ( I ) a . ?

While in the past , considerable work has been done on the realization of anaphoric links between related entities via referring expressions  ( ef . , e . g . , Tut in and Kittredge , 1092; Dale , 1980; Relier ,  1091) , only a few pro\[ ) os alseml ) hasize the relew mee of lexical means for the realization  o1" discourses truel : nre relations such ; mCON-TItAST in ( 11 ) ) and ELABORA'P ION ill ( 2 t ) ) and ( 3b )   , 2Itisiml > ori . antonote that the actual realization of a discourse relation mw vary with the semantics of the lexemes involved  .

Consider the following examples , which illustrate the three different reiteration relations  ( strict repetition in ( 7a )  , synonymy in (7b ) , and superordination in (7c )): (6) Last summer , Monica flew to Italy , (7) a . while Daniela flew to Norway . 
b . while Daniela took the plane to Norway.
c . while Daniela travelled to Norway.
Further substitution relations such as metaphoric repetition  ( 7d )  , negated az ~ tonyray (7e ) , etc . can be added : (7) d . while Daniela wafted a way to Norway . 
e . Daniela also did not stay at home.
Collocation stands for ' any recognizable lezicose -mastic relation ' between lexicM expressions in related discourse segments  . Examples of collocation relations are attr ibution  ( 7 f )  , partition (7g ) , means (7h ) , etc . : (7) f . it was a very pleasant journey . 
g . making as top over in Munich.
It.it was one of those ~ if laircrafts.
As our example show , reiteration and collocation relations help to ensure not only cohesion  , but also coherence in texts . Therefore , a text generator has to provide an organization of lexical resources that tailors discourse structure relations to reiteration and collocation relations  . This presupposes , on the one hand , a precise picture of which reiteration and collocation relations are available in language and how they are realizable  ; and , on the other hand , a finegraine dis-course model that contains these relations  . 
To make allowance for the global discourse organization  , which is performed independently from lexical resources  , we suggest a two level text planning task implementation  , with the first level realized by a Rhetorical Struclure  7'heory   ( its ' r )   ( Mann and Thompson ,  1987 ) style text planner and the second level--by a separate lexical choice module  . Then , the discourse organization of a text is done in two steps : in the first step  , the text planner predetermines the discourse structure relations  ; in the second step , the lexical choice module provides , in accordance with linguistic constraints , the final determination and the realization of these discourse structure relations  . 
The present paper reports an attemp to define lex -ieally biased discourse structure relations used in a partially implemented lexical choice module  . I ) ue to the lack of space , we do not discuss the module itself ; it is described in detail in ( Wanner ,  1992 ,  1994) . 
Here , we demonstrate how discourse organization for text generation can be refined by lexically biased discourse structure relations and how these relations are related to global discourse relations specified in the output of an RST style text planner  . 
In contras to the most discourse models ( cf . , e . g . , McKeown , 1985; Ch'osz and Sidner , 1986; Mann and Thompson ,  1987) , which take the clause ~ ts the minimal discourse segment  , we consider as discourse segments " perspectives "   ( cf . McCoy ,  1989 ) -specific views taken on a semantic entity ( an object , a new ~' nt , etc . ) . A perspective is a wording which is tailored to the lexical repertoire of an entity  ; it is realizable as a clause , a phrase , or as a single lexeme . Each of the clauses in the examples above can be considered as a realization of a single perspective  ; ~md there iteration and collocation relations that hold between the clauses as well-defined perspective pairs  . 
In our model , a single perspective is represented as a composition of Mel'&fl~'s Lexicall  , ~unctions ( hereafter LFs )   ( Mel'&fl and Polgu~re ,  11987) ; perspective pairs are represented as LI ~' sequences  . 
The lbllowing distinctive features characterize our model : ? it makes snre that all relations defined ~ treex pressible in language  , ? it allows for a realization of lexicM relations as subclansal relations between discourse segments  , ? it is sensitive to lexical and syntactic w triations\['or the realization of discourse structure relations  .

DISCOURSERELATIONS
Due to their functional content , El , ' sequence serve . 
~s instantiations of individual discourse structure relations  . In our work , we suggest hat these individual discourse structure relations can be organized cohe  , '-ently in terms of the fimctions antisemantic distinctions they represent  . In accordance with the claim that the availability of specific LF sequences idependent on the entities the LFs are applied to  , we furthex suggest hat this organization must be done individually for each predicativentity  ( el . Wanner , 1994) . 
Based on this , we define taxonomies ( one for each predicativentity ) which have been inspired by tlalliday's proposal for grouping interclaus allogico-semantic relations  ( el . Ilalliday , 1985) . l\[ow such an organization carl be realized efficiently using inheritance tecl miques is described in  ( Wanner ,  1992) . 
ST hls is not to say that these functions are the only ones that are possible Although our model is not restricted to interclausal relations  , two features o\['l I alliday's proposa lare wtlu -able to us:  ( i ) that a Iogico-semantic relation ' expands ' one wording by an another one rather than connecting two given wordings and  ( ii ) that a logico-semantic relation can be further decomposed with respect  , to its : 1 . semantics , 2 . syntactic realization , 3 . communicative structure , and 4 . with respect to the speaker's intention , which motiw ~ tes the selection of this relation during the text production process  . 
In what follows , we discuss first the general taxonomy of our ' expanding'discourse structure relations for processes and then the decomposition of there h > tions along these four dimensions  , l ? ollowing the conventions in R . ST , we call the expanded part ' nucleus ' and the expanding o  , e ' satellite ' . 
3 . 1 Taxonomy of Lexlcal Discourse Relations A taxonomy of lexical discourse  , structure relations is to be understood as a hierarchy of alternative choices of increasingly delicate relations  . The most delicate relations are I , F sequences represented by their functional content  . The top level of the . taxonomy represents , thus , the most global types of exI ) ansion . In accordance with ( llalliday ,  1985) , these are F , Lalm-RATION , MXTENSION , and I , \] NIIANCEMENT . ELAIt()I1 . A-TION subsumes all those , expansions which ensure a deeper understanding of t  , he meaning comnmnicated by the nucleus wording . A deeper understanding or the nucleus wording is ensured by reslaling  , refining , or clarifying it ( the next level of ELABORATION in the taxonomy )  . For example , all reiteration relations are of the I , ; LABORATION type . 
The EXTENSION expansions extend the meaning comnmnicated by tile nucleus wording  . This can be ( lone by introducing a new constituent that is related to what has linen said ill the nucleus  , by adding a new action of I . he known constitue uts , etc . Beginning extension is , e . g . , an EXTENSION . 
The ENIIANCIi : MI , ' NT expansions qualify the mean-lug conmmnieal . edI ) ytim nucleus wording by adding a reference o\[" causation  , time . , location , l ; qanne . r , mode , etc . An example of F , NIIANCEMEN Tiv causal enhancement . 
figure 1 shows illllOl'e detailtile ELABORATION fragment of the taxonomy in network tbrm  . According to this figure , ILESTA'PI , 3MENT can be realized as a conlras live , a generalized , or as a repeal-ingreslalemenl , respectively . As shown ill Table 2, CONTII . ASTIVERESTATEMENT corresponds to tile reit -eration negated antonymy  , GENE It AL1 ZING II . ESTATE-MENT to superordination , respectively .

The tirst and the most important ask intailoring the text plantolinguistic resources is to find alex-ieally biased discourse structure relation for the Rs'r relation specified in the text l  ) lan . The search is done in accordance with the filnctional content  , the intention of the speaker , and the contents of the arguments of the RST relation  . If tile RST relation connects unrelated case frames  8   ( as , e . g . , EVIDENCE in In winter , the days are short . It is getting light late and ea Hy dark . ) these case frames are realized independently without being connected by a lexical discourse structure relation  . If the cruse frames are related , tile following three variations are possible : ( i ) An RST relation instantiation coincides with a lex-ieal discourse structure relation  ; as , e . g . , the instantiation of RESTATEMENT in the following rudimentary text plan coinsides with our RESTATEMENT :  ( R2/RI . ~ ST a TI~MtrNT : statement 1 ( SAYING/SYI'UATION : sayerSveta/person:verb iage#unknown #: manner  ( quiet : scale#minima \]# ) : obligatory-roles ( : sayer , : verbiage , : manner , : situation )   ) : statement 2 ( SAYINO/SITUATION : sayer greta/person : manner  ( quiet : scale ~ minimal # ) : obligatory-roles ( : sayer , : verbiage , : manner ,   ,   ,   . o : ~ ituatiQn ))) . 
If so , timsuD ci ass meatlon of the lext caldis course structure relation deter  , nines its final realization . For example , the above text plan could be realized as a GENERALIZED II  . I , ~ STATF , MI , ~NT : S'velafl'l'islerle ; sicsay leel was . qanzleise lit . ' Sveta whispered ; she said something very quietly ' ; an INTENSIFYING RESTATE-MlgN'r : Svelasagle ehvas sehrleise  ; sich auchtees kaumhb ' r barhinll t . ' Svetasaid something very quietly ; she brea the dithardly audible ' , etc . 
( ii ) An RST relation instantiation subsume several dis-sCase frames are considered to be unrelated if between them or one of their roles no identity  , is a , causer , location , etc . relation holds . 
tinct classes of lexical discourse structure relations  ; as , e . g . , the instantiation of the aST relation CONTRAST in  ( this plan is also highly simplified ) :  ( R2/OONTRAST:actimn ( OCCUPATION/SITUATION : actor Roman/nation : actoe Gaul/state : obligatory-roles  ( : actor , actee , : situation ) ) : action2 ( DeCUPATION/SITUATION : actor Roman/nation : actee  ( village/location : part of : Gaul ) : negation +: obligatory-roles ( : actor , actee , : situation ) ) ) may be realized either as CONTI~ASTIVE CI , ARIFICA-TION ( ga ) or as CONTR . ASTIVEENIIANCEMENT(,Oh ): (9) a . (2 aul is entire hj occupied by the I~o-marts ; well , notenti ~ vly .   .   . one small village still hohls out . 
b . Gaulisuh nost entire hjoe cvpied by the l?omans ; but one small village still hohls out . 
In this case , tim taxonomy of lexical discourse structure relations is entered at a relatively general level  ( in the worst case at TOP )  . 
( iii ) Anl IST relation is not captured by our taxonomy ( as , e . g . , CONCI , ISSION ) . Then , the corresponding ease fi'ames are treated as unrelated  ( see above )  . 
5 RELATED WORK
Our proposal fortile description of lexically biased discourse structure relations resembles l  ) anlos ' work ( Danlos ,  1987) , who presented acceptable hmse pattern sequences expl Mtlyina Discourse Grammar  . 
The . basic difference between Danlos ' work and ours is that in the Discourse  ( h'amrnar , clause patterns e-qtlences are represented as concreLevalency sehell latlt while in our model they are represented as functional distinctions that encodes equcn deso\['I  , FS . As a result , we do I/el . \[' aee the probhml of being restricted to a concrete small domahlasl  ) anlos does . 
Metoer's text phumer ( Meteer , 1992) is another prol ) os a . l for the realization of lexically biased discourses trucl  . ure relations . \[/ ut while we argue that lexically biased ( liscourse structure relal ; ions are to I ) erealized by a functionally motiw d , edh ' . xical choice . 
model , Meteer sugggests a singlestrue tundly motirated model For text planning  , which also sul ) sumes lexical choice . This is different from , e . g . , ( R . ubi-neff ,  1992) , who ensures the expressil ) ility o1" discourse structure relations provide ( lI ) y a conventional text l ) hmner by annotating linguistic structures . 
Elhadad's prol ) osal ( Elhadad , 1992) to use 7bpoi ( inference , ' ules that encode relations between t ) ropo-sitk ) ns incorporating lexical material ) as discourse structure relations is aimed at exploiting lexical phenomena for discourse organization  . Elhadad focuses , however , on the ' argumentative potential ' of lexieal items r  ; ~t . hert . llan on lexica . llybiased discourse structure relations . 
3746 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE

In this paper , we argue < l that it , is useful Lo distinguish between two levels of discourse organization : a global discourse organization  , which is not afli~cted by linguistic means ; and a finer discourse or gauizal , iou , which is built tip in accordance with the linguistic material that is availal > le for the meaning communicated  . 
We have shown that reiteration aud collocatiott relations may function as discourses tru <: ture relatious and that these relations are well represented by Lez'-ical Function sequences  . We presented a taxonomy of lexically biased discourses trucl : ure relations  , which is related to l I alliday's proposal for grou I > ing inter-claus allogico-semantic relations aud suggested l  . ouse this taxonomy ill a lexical ch <> iceniodule . 
One of the ope=n problen is we face is how sull i < : iently detailed COlltP  , Xtllal COll strail its CttllbeaC ( lllirc dill or : der to guide the choice of one discourse structllre relation over others  .  ' . \[' his will ccr taillly be olle of the topics we wil I have to address in the future  .
