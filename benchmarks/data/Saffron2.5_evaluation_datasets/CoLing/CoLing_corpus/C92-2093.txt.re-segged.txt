I-INTRODUCTION
Several works IMcK eowu 86 , Suthers 88\] have emphasized the common aspects of Explanation Productioni expert systems and Text Generation  . The work described in this paper deals with text generation applied to a particular type of explanations : causal explanations of physical systems  . They have a keady motivated influential developments in the field of qualitative reasoning about physical systems  . A central goal of the theories developed in \[ De Kleer  84\] and \[ Forbus 84\] was to elaborate conceptual frameworks for providing causal accounts of physical systems  , sensitive to our common sense understanding of the physical world  . Those qualitative causal models constitute an adequate starting point as we are interested in how people present such causal explanations in verbal form  . 
We will describe our approach for text generation , based ou the study of texts collected in encyclopedia and textbooks  , and currently developed in a system intended to be associated to the qualitative simulation system SQUALE\[  J6z6quel & Zimmer 92\]  . Our conceptual model , which constitutes the input othe text generation process  , is based on Qualitative Process Theory IF or bus 84\]  . 
According to the " traditional " division of tasks in text generation  , the transition from conceptual representation of causal behaviour to causal explanation in atural lau-gouge is viewed as a three-stage process : content specific a-tion  , text organization and surface generation . 
The content specification task aims at posting communicative goals described by means of communicative acts on conceptual entities  . In particular , the causal explanation to be produced is often restricted to  , some particular events of the causal behaviour . We will show how relevant information and appropriate communicative acts are identified  . 
Text organization is the most elaborate part of our model and is also divided into three tasks  . 
The first is concerned with the construction of a textual structure from a set of communicative acts established during content specification  . This structure , which takes an intermediary place between communicative acts and surface realizations  , pecifies essentially prescriptions on grouping and ordering of textual units  . This process is achieved through the application of discourse strategies which control local I ransitions from communicative acts to possible organizational preseriptions  . Wedcseribe three strategies used for structuring causal explanations : a causal chain strategy  ( for organizing simple causal chains )  , a parallel strategy ( to impose a parallel structure on the text )  , and a concessive strategy ( for performing concessive acts )  . The second task segments the textual structure into sentential contents  . Several factors are revolved , mainly communicative form of textual relations and number of textual unite expressed in a sentence  .   7'he stylistic adjustment task deals with stylistic considerations related to lexicosyntactic choice  , s . We wan to ensure an intersentential compatibili - ty  , from a stylistic point of view , between linguistic realizations . 
Concerning surface generation , two types of systems have been considered : a sentence geuerator \[ Fournier  91\] based on the Meaning-Text Theory \[ Mel'cuk 88a \] and a syntactic component based on equivale nee classes between sentence structures  . 
Our approach suggests a clear separation of knowledge sources involved in each of these stages  . We will start with a presentation f the conceptual model  , where we propose a characterization of causal interactions betweeophysical events  ( essentially , physical parameter changes ) . The next sections deal with the different stages of the text generation process  .

H-THECONCE PTUAL FRAME WORK
Qualitative Process Theory helps to capture common sense knowledge implicit in mathematical models of traditional physics  . Besides , it provides an ontological framework for expressing physical causality  , by expliciting the physical mechanisms . In order to describe physical situations , two kinds of structures are used : individuals views  , for representing physical objects and behavioural bstractions  , and physical processes such as fluid and heat flows  . Gradual parameters are associated to identified entities  ( individual views and processes ) and causal dependencies are expressed by means of two types of qualitative relations : influences  , for direct effects of processes , and qualitative proportionalities , which propagate direct effects of pro-e esses on the other parameters  . It follows that the initial cause of a parameter change is always a process  . 
Qualitative relations can aim at opposit effects . In diephysical situation of figure 1 , the mercury expansion tends to increase the mercury level while the tube expansion tends to lower it  . The first influence is predominant , since an increase of the mercury level is observed in that situation  , and thus the second is inhibited 1 . In order to represent different types of causal interactions  , we have introduced the causal primitives cause , contrary-cause and opposite-effects which are defined according to influences between events :   , , cause : causal relation between two events linked with a predominant influence  ( for example , mercury expansion is the cause of mercury level rise  ) ? contrary-cause : contrastive rlation between two events linked with an inhibited influence  . One of the events is the " contrary cause " of the other  ( tubexpansion is a contrary cause of mercury level rise  )  . 
? opposite-effects : contrastive rlation between two events which aim at opposit effects  ( mercury expansion and tube expansion )  . 
The last two primitives are called causal opposition relations  . In that framework , physical system behaviours are represented with influence graphs  , where physical events are linked with causal primitives  . An influence graph encloses all events and causal interactions identified in the given physical situation  . 
I11-CONTENT SPECIFICATION
The content specification is primarily concerned with selection of relevant physical events and causal interactions from the influence graph  . But the problem should not be narrowed to factual knowledge selection  , for the concept u-1 . It does not mean that hemer cury expansion has no effect on the mercury level but that no effect is perceived at that level of a ~ tr ~ ction  . 
ul content of the text cannot be considered independently of the speaker's communicative intentions  . Communicative roles assigned to conceptual entities have crucial implications at each stage of the text generation process  . 
Hence , they should be mad explicit at the content specification level as well as thei related conceptual units  . In our model , the content specification task results in a set of com-munica five acts  , which represents heillocutionary structure of the message  . These acts are performed so as to produce some effects on the hearer  , as modifying his belief system or affecting his emotional states  . They may be characterized according to these in tended effects  . We focus here on three types of acts : inform , explain and concede , and especially in the context of causal explanation production  . 
Roughly speaking , an act of informing aims at making the hearer believe some proposition while an act of explaining  , viewed as a discourse act , has the effect of Supporting a previously introduced proposition i order to favour its acceptance  .   ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are respective realizations of acts of informing and explaining :  ( 1 ) Ladilatation dumercure provoquela haussedu niveau demercure  ,   ( The mercury expansion causes the rise of the mercury level  . ) (2) Leniveau demercuremonte , pareeque lemer curesedilate . 
( The mercury level rises , because of the mercury expansion . )  ( 1 ) is a possible achievement of the act : inform ( cause ( Dsl volume ( mercury ) \] = l , 
Dsl level ( mercury )\] = l )) 2 and (2) , of both acts : in form ( Dsllevel ( mercury ) \] = 1  ) ) explain ( Ds\[level ( mercury ) \] =1  , Ds\[volume ( mercury ) \] =1 ) In terms of speech acts , (1) i ~ a single assertion , which informs the hearer of the causal connection between the two events  . In contrast , (2) contains two assertions , the second assuming an explicative function . Note that inbe the ases the same conceptual content is involved  . Some differences between sentences ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) as the order of information units are due to distinct communicative role assignments  . 
We will show in the next . section how these intended " rhetorical " effects influence choices at the text organization level  . 
But now let us turn to the content specification procedures  . 
The determination f communicative acts highly depends on the problem solving activity  ( here , qualitative simula-2 . In the formalism of Qualitative Process Theory , the Ds function provides the derivative sign of the parameter given as argument  . Ds\[X\]=-I means that X decreases ,   Ds\[X\]=0 that X is steady and Ds\[X\]=I that X increases .

It proceeds as an incremental process and each step determines more precisely the relevant information  . First the notion of theme-object , similar to global focus \[ Grosz86\] ( and adapted to generation by McKeown )  , is used to carry out a rough se-lectiou of relevant causal interactions : events which are not in  ( direct or indirect ) causal interaction with any theme-object are ignored  . The theme-object identification depends on the user interaction mode with the system  . In the simplest cases , theme--objects an be identified with privileged properties of the physical system  , such as outputs of an artifact . But in a dialogue system , an analysis of user queries is necessary . 
Second , the selection is refined and emnmunicative acts are selected according to user's beliefs and expectations expressed in his request  . Esr , ccially , communicative acts on causal opposition relations are introduced in two kind of situation :  ( a ) if a complete description of causal behaviour is required or  ( b ) within a concessive strategy , which seems appropriate when the user focuses on an expected but yet uno eccurredvent  . For example , in order to reply to the question " why doesn't the mercury level drop ?"  , causal opposition relations are not ignored for it suggests that the user is interested with inhibited influences which might have caused a mercury drop  . Similar considerations are expressed in McCoy's shemata for correcting misconceptions about object classifications\[McCoy  89\]  . 
IV-TEXTORGANIZATION
Text organization deals with multiple communicative acts simultaneously  . This is one of the main features of our approach for it provides the ability to impose a global structure on the text  . Global coherence cannot be ensured if communicative acts are considered independently of one another  . Additionally , there is not a one to one correspondence between communicative acts and sentences of the text  . A single utterance often ralizes multiple comm unica-live acts and inversely a single act may be spread on several utterances  . For example , sentence ( 1 ) may also be uttered so as to achieve the three following acts : in forming the hearer of mercury expansion and mercury level rise  , and that these events are causally related . This conception in language generation has been initiated by Appelt in the KAMP system\[ Appelt  85\]  . He showed how multiple illocution ary acts can be achieved in a single utterance  . 
Communicative acts are not directly mapped to linguistic forms  . The textual structure is introduced as an intermediary level of abstraction between the specified content and the text  . It is mainly composed of textual units , inter-clau-sal relations , which indicate how these units should be related , and order prescriptions . 
IE . I-Inter-Clausal Relations
Several text generation systems use inter-clausal relations which have been introduced in textual inguistics under various forms \[ Grimes  75\]  , \[ Van Djik 81\] , \ [ Halliday 761 . 
Rhetorical Structure Theory ( RST ) \[ Mann & Thompson 87\] is a significant approach of this trend and it has been partially used in text planning systems \[ Hovy  88\]  , \[ Moore & Swart out 89\] . In RST , the structure of a text is obtained by composition of rhetorical relations expressing various kinds of dependencies  , ~metimes semantic ( " subject matter " relations in RST terminology )  , sometimes purely rhe-toricai ( presentation alreation in RST )  . In contrast , in our approach the intended rhetorical effects are considered as communicative goals and are specified at the content specification level  . As a consequence , inter-clausal relations involved in our system are exclusively semantic  . Furthermore , they are characterized in a way similar to the paratactic/hypotactic distinction of rhetorical predicates \[ Grimes  75\] so that hey can take different communicative forms  . Under the equiponderant form , the same interest is assigned to the arguments of the relation while under the preponderant form  , one of them is presented as more central . 
Arguments of relations are composed of textual units  , which are semantic translations of conceptual entities  . An argument may be simple ( limited to a single textual unit ) or complex ( composed of several textual units )  . 
At present our work on inter-clausal relations focuses on causal and adversative rlations  ( i . e . on relations involved in the expression of our causal primitives  )  . 
IV.I.I-Causal Inter-Clausal Relations
In the cause-effect inter-clausal relation , events denoted in the first argument are presented as being the cause of events denoted in tile second  . According to the communicative form ( equipond or antor preponderant ) of the relation , differentypes of communicative acts may be achieved  . The following elementary transitions ( in a simplified form ) both lead to the intrc~luction facause-effect relation  ( in PROLOG notation , arguments in capitalized letters represent variables  ) : transition ( in form_of_a_causal link , inform ( cause(C , t ~) , cause-effect ( equi , C , E)) . 
transition ( explain with a causal link , \[ explain(C , E ) , cause(C , E ) I , cau . ~' e-effect(pre , C,E)) . 
But there is not necessarily a direct correspondence b-tween relations of conceptual level and relations of textual level  , as in the above transitions . Hence , the following transition may hold in some context  , even if no causal interaction exists between on the one h and C  1  , E1 and on the other hand C2 , E2: transition ( in form of_multiple_causal links , linform ( cause(C1 , El )) , ir ( orm ( cause(C2 , E2)) l , cause-effect ( equi , \[ C1 , C2\] , \[ E1 , E21) ACTes DECOTING-92 , NANTES . 2328^dirt1992620 PROC . OFCOLING-92, NAN'rEs , AUa . 2328, 1992 IV . I . 2 Adversative lnter ~7 . 1 ausal Relations As mentioned in section H , behavioural description of a physical system contains not only causal inks between events but also causal opposition relations  . These relations are often phrased in natural language with concessive connectives  ( but , though , however ,  . . . ) which , following Piaget\[Piaget78\] , express a discordance between cause a m1 effect . The sentences ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) illustrate respectively expressions of contrary ~cau  . ~ e and opposite-effects relations : ( 3 ) Letube sedilate uu ~ is leniveau demercure raonte  . 
( The tube expands but the mercury level rises . )  ( 4 ) Let ubes edilater a aislemer curesedilate aussi  . 
( The tube expands but the mercury expands too . ) The study of linguistic onnectives within the linguistic Theory of Argumentation \[ An~ombre & Ducrot  83\]  , \[Aas-combre 84\] and especially the French connective mais ( but ) has showed that two kinds of semantic opposition may be expressed by concessive connectives : direct opposition  , where one of the two linked proposition sipres -ented as an argument for a conclusion oppo~d to the other proposition  , and indirect opposition , where the two propositions are presented as arguments for opposite conclusions  .   ( 3 ) conveys a direct opposition since the conclusion ( the mercury level drop ) aimed by the first proposition is opposed to the second one  ( the mercury level rise ) and ( 4 ) conveys an indirect opposition since the two propositions aim at opposite conclnsions  ( mercury level drop and mer-cury level rise )  . 
In order to represent these semantic oppositions , we have introduced the adversative inter ~ zlausal relations direct-opposition and indirect -opposition  . Acts of informing on causal opposition relations are then realized by means of these adversative r lations : transition  ( in for ra_of a_contrary_cause , inform ( contrary-catt ~ e(C , E )) , direct-opposition ( pre , C , E)) . 
transition ( in form_of_opposite effects , inform ( opposite-effects ( C1 ,  2)) , indirect . ~ opposition ( equi , Cl , C2)) . 
But also concessive acts , taking advantage of the conces-sive nature of adversative rlations : transition  ( concede a contrary_cause , lcone ede(C1) , inform ( cause(C2 , E2)) , opposite effects ( C1 , C2) 1 , \[ indirect--opposition ( equi , Cl , C2) , cause-effect ( equi , C2 , E2)\]) . 
IV . 2 - I : rom content specification to textual structure As we diseussed earlier  , cornmanica five acts should not be examined independently of one another if one wants to pro ~ duce well-structured texts  . A local transition represents a possible treatment of a limited number of communicative acts at textual level  . Hence , choice and application of local transitions are governed by discourse strategies  , They determine transitions which may be applied after an analysis of the overall set of communicative acts  . In particular , they cxploithe underlying conceptual structure of comnurnica-live acids  . For cau ~ lexplanations , the mainly used strategies are the following : ? Causal Chain Strategy : If the underlying conceptual structure is a causal chain and communicative acts are of the inform or explain type then lollow causal order and apply transitions in form of a_causal link and explain with a causal link  ( cffig2 )  . 
* Parallel Strategy : It is a form of parallelism rhetorical " figure " which may be used when the underlying conceptual structure is comlx~sed of two causal chains with a common initial cause  . This strategy also exploit he causal order and transitions in form of common cause link and in form of multiple causal_links hold the highest priorities  ( cffig3 )  . 
tramition ( in form of common_cause_lin LL\[inform ( cause ( C , El )) , inform ( cause(C , E2))\] , cause-effect ( equi , C , \[ El , E21 ) ? Concessive Strategy : This strategy deals with concessive acts which involve causal opposition relations  . 
A preferential order is suggested : the conceded fact pre--cedes the other units  . 
Priorities are assigned to the strategies so that conflicts can be solved  . 
IVJ-Textual Structure Segmentation
The purpose of the segmentation task is to delimit he content of the ~ utences which will constitute the final text  . 
The determination fasentential content involves everal heuristics  . Some of the maim at increasing the scope of the sentence while others aim at reducing it  . One of the main heuristics deals with the communicative nature of inter-clausal relations : ince preponderant relations often appear in subordinate forms at syntactic level  , equiponderant relations are privileged . Hence , delimitation of sentential content starts with the choice of equiponderant relations  . The content is then completed with preponderant relations  . In addition , the number of textual units of a sentence is limited and introduced relations may be removed from the sentential content if it contains too many textual units  . The segmentation is " also coustralued by the conceptual nature of inlormation units  . For instance , an initial cause may be realized in a single sentence  .

( except the stylistic adjustment task ) . Two differentypes of sentence generation approaches have been examined  . 
Oar main approach aims at coupling the text planning system with a generic sentence generator \[ Fournier  91 \] based on the Meaning-Text Theory \ [ Mel'cuk 88\]  . In the Mea-ning-Text Model , the input representation is a semantic network enriched with several structures  , mainly the bipar-titions theme/rheme , asserted/presupposed and given/new . 
The construction of semantic networks is based on a con-ceptual-semantic dtionary  , which specifies correspondences between concepts and semantic definitions  . The gi-ven ~ new structure has already been integrated in text generation systems  ( e . g . IN iren burg88\]) . It denotes specif-ic linguistic onstructions and will constrain choices during realization  . For instance , a predicative structure will be ratherealized as an assertion if it belongs to the new part or as a nominalization if it belongs to the given part  . This characterization of semantic representations plays a crucial role from a textual perspective  . The generation process must be sensitive to progression of new information through the text  , even at the realization stage . In this spirit , distribution of semantic units among given and new parts is carried out with regard to conceptual units introduced in previous entences  . Predicative structures of the semantic network whose referents have been previously evoked are systematically marked as given and the others as new  . Once the semantic representation is built ( only the semantic network and the given/new structure have been considered  )  , the realizer produces surface forms and paraphrases may be generated  , essentially by lexical substitutions . 
The second approach we are experimenting relies on equivalence classes between sentence structures  , which may be compared to Discourse Grammars described in \[ Danlos  85\]  . An equivalence class represents potential realizations of a kind of semantic content  . Our investigation is currently limited to classes related to causality  . We have defined classes for expressing causal and opposition relations  . This categorization flinguistic expressions provides a suitable basis for stylistic adjustment mechanisms  . Syntactic and lexical constraints arising from stylistic considerations govern the choice of sentence structures within classes  . In particular , we have implemented a " principle of stylistic variety " which prevents excessive use of similar syntactic constructions  . This principle is particularly useful in causal explanation generation because concepts involved are of similar types  . To illustrate this point , let us consider the text in figure 2 . When generating the last sentence , stylistic adjustment recommends the realizer to avoid coordinative structures  ( with connectives such as thus , consequently ,   . . . ) since such a construction has been used in the previous en--tence  . A structure with a verb conveying causality ( e . g . to cause , to result in , . . . ) is then selected . 
Our system benefits from a number of earlier works on language generation  , as those we have mentioned along the above sections  . We will focus the comparison on two particular points  . The first concems the overall architecture and modularization in text generation systems  ; the second deals with text planning applied to causal explanation generation  . Text planning and surface generation have often been conceived as separated components  . But separation f tasks is not always extended within text planning  . For example , rhetorical schemata used in TEXT\[McKeown 85\] specify in the same structure not only information units which may be introduced bat also their orders in the final text  . Other systems as GOSSIP\[Carcagno & Iordanskaja  89\] and PAULINE\[Hovy 88b \] have isolated content determination from text structuring  . The approach described in this paper also proposes a clear separation of the content specification and the textual organization skills  . The main motivation behind this division is that it is convenient to de-cide whato say  ( more precisely , to set ( almost ) all communicative goals to achieve ) before taking any organizational decisions . Hence , content specification proceeds regardless of structuring considerations  . However , we think that a more cooperative interaction between these two major components is necessary to allow goal revisions at the text organization level  . 
Oar system can also be compared to TAILOR\[ Paris  87\] which generates natural language descriptions of physical devices  . A significant advantage of TAILOR is its ability to combine structuralnd causal description strategies  . Nevertheless , causal interactions are restricted to simple causal links and there is no attempt to explicit he roles they can playla discourse  . 
VII-FUTHER DEVE LOP MENTS
First a better conceptual characterization of physical systems would contribute to improve the quality of causal explanations  . We need a more precise description of causal interactions which allows  , for instance , to discern enable ~ ment conditions from other causal in k s  . 
With regards to text planning , number of extensions are possil ) le . We intend to define strategies for structural descriptions and also enhance the control mechanisms of discourse strategies  . Furthermore , practical validation of the overall approach requires a larger coverage of communicative acts  . Another interesting extension would consist in relating stylistic adjustment mechanisms to pragmatic features \ [ Hovy  89\] in order to strengthen context sensitivity .
