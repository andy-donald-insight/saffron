S3C Maximal flexibility in controlling CFG parsing can be obtained in !  , tie active ( : hart parser\[Kay80\]\[WinogrM8a\] . h ~ this algorith , ,/ qchemata ,  ~ , parsing p , ' ocG qsi , ': ; taken as a sequence of attaching an active or in active arc to Chmq  , one at each time . 
Though each attachment of an arc creates a set of arc  . ': to be ~ ttached , the churl parser in a / ~ eneral foJm does not at ttm h  6~3 them ' in mediately , but registers them in Agenda , A scheduler decides which arc in Agenda is to be attchcd next  . Because no a priori ordering of arc attachment is assumed  , one can realize a bitrary , flexible control mechanisms in this schemata . 
l lowever , such a maximal flexibility is obtained at the cost of efficiency  . The scheduler has to be invoked at each cycle to decide which arc to be attached  , l : ' urthermore , when arcs are created , we have to take a way tile arcs which exist in Agendaor in Chart  , beforere . gistering them in Agenda . The same are smay exist to the arcs only whose leftmost constituents are filled by in active arcs  . Because of lher each a bilily eondilion , we also have to check applicability of rules to all the inactive arcs in the right neighbor  , whenever an active arc is attached . Such repeated cheekings can be avoided in more restricted algorithms  . 
htKGW-t-p , we use an Agenda ? like list ( S-list-suspending list ) but unlike the Agenda in the active chart parser , it only keep stile arcs which will be tried after the prelerred ones fail  . 
The other created arcs are attached immediately , instead of tllescheduler , the SBC has its own control scheme for building PPTs mechanically from left to right  . The scheduler of KGW-I-p is more like a demon watching the SBC  . When it finds less preferred PPTs ( arcs ) generated , it jumps out to store them in the S-list . Or when it finds the SBC goes to dead end , it decides which suspended PPTs in the S-list should be resumed  . 
The SBC in KGW+p uses two data structures , one for in ac- . tive arcs and the other for active arcs in Chart . As in Fig .  2 , the inactive arcs from vertex i to j are stored illP  ( i , j ) and the active arcs with ending vertices i are stored in G  ( i )  . We call the arcs in P ( i , j ) in active PPTs and the arcs iu G ( i ) active PPTs . 
Both P ( i , j ) and G ( i ) are realized as flavor instances of each type ( P-Flavor and G-Flavor )  .

Fig . 2T ' ~ o Data Str . etures ill I ( GW+p We also realize active and in active PPTs as instances of the PPT-flavor  , each of Which keeps the following items ( e ? PPT in the following means the PPT which is expressed by the flavor instance  )   ( 1 ) starting and ending vertices of c-PPT ( 2 ) syntactic category and features of the top node of e-PPT  ( 3 ) completed constituents : a list of inactive PPT . .
instances filling the child nodes of e-PPT ( 4 ) remainders : a list of constituents to be filled . If c ~ . PI'T is in active , the remainders is an empty list . 
We call the leftmost constituent of the remainders the waili'ng constiluen LNote that the waiting constituents of PPTs in G  ( i ) are to be filled by in active t'PTs with starting vertex i  . 
(5 ) pairs of a larger PPT which incorporates c-PPT as the leftmost constituent and the rule which ww~J used to create the larger PPT  . 
' Because PPT-instances keep (1) . , (4) as the arcs in Char ~ , they can be suspended ill the S-list ( not immediately sLored in P ( i , j ) or G(i )) and resumed afterwards freely .   ( 5 ) is used to avoid redundant processings in the retrial phases  ( see Seclion 4 )  . 
The basic cycle of parsing is implemented as a set of method  , ~ el P--F lavor When P ( i , j ) - instanee is triggered , , the methods in P-Flavor perform the following operations for each PPT stored in p  ( i , j ) . 
o ( Extension of Aclive PPTs ) look for active PPTs in G ( i ) which can incorporate the PPT as the leftmost constituent of the remainders  , and create new PPTs ? ( New Rule Applicalion ) look for rules wimseleft most constituents in rhs can be unified with the PPT and whose nonterminals in lhs can reach to the nonterminals of the waiting constituents of active PPTs in G  ( i )  , and applies them to create new PPTs By storing newly created PPTs in the corresponding P  ( i ' , j ') or G(j ~) immediately , a naive bottom-up , breadth-first and left--to-right parsing with topdown filtering can be easily realized as follows  . 
(1) After completion of the basic cycle , P ( i , j ) -instance triggers the execution of the basic cycle in P  ( i-1 , j ) - instance (2) A trigger to P (0 , j ) -instance is taken as a trigger to the SBC -manager  . The manager creates new PPTs by using the rules A ~ aj + i  ( aj + l is the j + lth words )  , stores them in P ( j+I , j + l ) and triggers
P ( j+I , j + l ) o instance ( 3 ) Parsing is started by triggering P ( 0 , /0)-intance ( This leads to the triggering of P (1 , 1) in (2)) . 
The basic control scheme of the SBC is the same as the above one  . However , in KGWT p , after each basic cycle of creating new PPTs , newly created PPTs are rated by the PRC and the scheduler suspends less preferred  ( active or inactive ) PPTs by storing them in the S-list . Only preferred ones are stored in C0 rrg sponding P ( i ' , j ") or G(j ") m parallel . Thus , though the schedule rloosely controls the whole process  , the SBC analyzes sentences basically from left to right in a breadth-first manner by its own efficient control scheme  . Note that the basic control scheme is an extended one of the algorithm proposed by V  . Pratt\[Pratt?5\]to deal with n-sty rules .

6 Experiments
We conducted various experiments by using KGW+p . In this section , we will show the experiment of disambiguating sentences containing the word that  . That can be taken as a pronoun , a detenninner , a relative pronoun , a complementizer , a noun as an antecedent of a relative clause , a conjunction for an appositional clause or adverbial clause  , an adverb , etc . 
The followings are examples were alize as preference rules in the experiment  . ( Note that , in the present experiment , the PVs 6iven by independent evidences are classified into 5 ranks , most preferred (+2) , more preferred (+1) , neutral (0) , less preferred (-1) audleast preferred (-2)) .

Fig . 6 Ex~nple of Preference Rules ( 1 ) Nouns such as fact , news , etc . are often collocated with appositional causes . When the head of a noun phrase preceding that is one of su & nouns  , the apposilional clause interpolation is more preferred  . 
(2 ) Wheat the verb in the sentence is one of the verbs subcategorized by that-clause  , the compleme Mizeri noter pretation is most preferrred  . 
(3 ) When the word so or such appears iu the preceding part of the sentence  , tile adverbial phrase inter-p relation is most preferred  . 
(4) PP . -attachments over clauses are less preferred . 
(5 ) Omission of relative pronouns is less preferred . 
(6 ) The pronoun and determiner interprel aliou of that are less preferred in written texts  . 
(7 ) Different usages of a verb have different preferences  . The verb to fell , for example , has five usages , ' to tells th to * b ' , ' to tell slh ' , ' to tells bsth ' , ' to tells blh af-cl ' and ' to tell ' . The last usage ( the intransitive usage ) has the least preference . 

An example of actuM preference rules is given in Fig  .  6 . The sentences in the following are used in the exper in mr  , t . 
1 . I told the fact that sulfuric acid dissolves the metal  . 
2 . I told the man that sulfuric acid dissolves the metal  . 
3. I was sotired that I could not move.
4 . I was so surprised at the fact that John told us . 
5 . I told the fact that sulfuric acid dissolves the metal to John  . 
For 1 and 2 , the SBC generates seven descriptions as follows ,   ( a ) \[ s ' "\[ vp tell\[np the\[n 1 fact lapp-el that sulfuric . .\]\]\]\]\] ( l))\[o . . . \[vptell\[np the fact ~\[ that cat hat sulfuric '  . .\] l \] ( c)C . .\[vpteU \[ npthe fact \[ rel_cl\[npthat sulfmic \ ]   . .\]\] \[ npthe metallll ( d ) \[ s " "\[ vpteu\[np the\[nplfact\[app-cl\[ np that sulfuric\]  . .\]\]\]\] t ( e ) \[\[ tell\[thefact\]\[\[thatsulfurm\]\] \]\] s'"vpnp'that-elnp '"""  ( 0\[ . ~ . . . \[vptell\[np the fact\[rel_cl that sulfuric . .\]\]\]\[ npthe metal \]\]\] ' ( g ) \[ s'"\[vptell\[nptilefact\[app_cl that sulfuric  . .\]\]\[ npthe m tal \]\]\] ( c ) -  ( g ) are rated low because they contain less preferred co  , ,--structions . \] ~ klrexample ,   ( c ) contain stile ommision of al'elative pronoun , the determiner interpretation f that , a PP-attachment over a clause ( the phraselhem et al )  , etc .

For the sentences 1 and 2 ,   gGW4'p succeeds in integrating such different so ils of preferential cues to give the highest PVs to the interpretations most preti~rable for till  . sna , ii readers , t , ' urthermore , because the p ~ . ths which lead to these interpretations ht we the highest PV  . ,; during the whole parsing process , ~ mythrrm hold vt ~ . lues can be used for suspending less pret . ~rred interpretations .

KGW+p allows one to prepare knowledge for ~ latural language parsing in two separate forms  . One is for the conMrai ' altype of knowledge and the other is for the preference type of  . knowledge . 
Bynsing the conslraiut type of knowledge , tile Sl-iC ( Struc--tmeBnikling Component ) in I ( GW+p produces partial parse trees mechanically from left to right in a breadth-llrst real > her  . ' Phescheduler , which is a kind of demo's watching the SBC , loosely controls the whole parsing process by utilizing PVs  ( Plausibility Values ) given by the PRC ( Preference Rating Con > ponent )  . The PRC uses the preference type of knowledge to compute the PVs  .
