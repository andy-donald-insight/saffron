Mey 21 . Level-Oriented Systems in Computational Linguist ics A new model for computational linguistic perform ~  , ~ has recently been proposed by the Czechoslovak group of workers at Charles Unlverslty ~ Prague ~ under the direction of PoS gall  ( lp2 )  . This model has Slg-nificant theoretlcal impll cations  , since it offers an alternative to transformationally based solutions of the problems encountered in automatic syntactic analysist and consequently ~ to the transform at lona ~ model itself oIn particular  , the new model claims to compete favorably with the transformation alone ~> generative power and structural characterlzatio ~  ;   . J sentences . 
Central to this model is the notion of a " multi- level " or " stratified " grammar  . The generation of a sentence at the highest ( " deepest " ) level of the grammar proceeds by a set of contextfree  ( CF ) rules the output of these rules is then transduced to lower levels by a series of pushdowns to reautomata  . The output of the final transduction is some " surface " representation of the sentence to be generated  . 
Me?32 . CF-Preservatlon under Transduction The whole system des?ribed in the preceding section is said to be " weakly equivalent to a CF phrase structure grammar "  ( 1:148 ,  221) . This assertion is claimed to derive from theorems formulated by N  . Chomsky and RoJ . Evey (3; 4) , which maintain that the output of a pushdown store transducer  ( pdt ) is equivalent to the set of CF languages ( i:109 ;  2:2 . 2 . 5) . 
However , the original theorems about this equivalence concerned pushdowns to reacceptors  ( pda )  , not transducers ( pd t as defined by Ginsburg ( 5:102 ) ) ; for pdt ( as used by Sgall and his group ) tCF-preservation is known not to obtain in general  ( 5:104 )  . 
The condition under which pd t will preserve CF langua-gesis stated by Ginsburg in Th  .  3 . 5 . 1 .  (5:104)' . 
given apda Mtap dtS,L-T ( M),
S(L ) is CFIffM and S are associated , i . e . S is obtained by adding outputs to M , the pdath at accepts L . 
For the case of the Czechoslovak " battery " of transducers  , this condition could actually be fulfilled , although the authors never say so , explicitly ? I am
Mey 4 referring to their extra condition on the system  , as formulated in " the existence of inverse automata for the single levels of the pushdown part\[of the grammar  , JM\]"(1:146) . Hence the impreciseness of the Czechoslovak proposal may amount to no more than a matter of incomplete formulation  . 
In a recent article , however , -Ginsburg and Rose ( 6 ) have shown that the earlier theorem on which they based CF-preservatlon conditions for pdt is false ?  ( And ~ by the same token pso are the original theorem of Evey's  ( 4:2?6?6 ) and a nearller theorem by Ginsburg and Rose ( 7:3 . 2)) . According to the 1968 revised version of the latter ~ heorem by Ginsburg and Rose  ( 6:3? 2~ ) ~ CF ~ p ~ eserva ~ ion is made dependent upon an addl -tlona ~ condition on the pdt~n~m~y~thato ~ ~est~Ict-ing its ou~pu ~% o'~hese strings that are produced by the device when it ends up in an accepting  ( oz final ) state , In all other cases ~ the language generated by the pdt will not be equivalent to the set of CF languages  , but simply constitute a ~ ecurslvely enumer-ab lese % ~ 
Mey 53 . Practical Consequences for the Prague System For the case under consideration  , the new insight referred to in the preceding section has two slgnlfl-cant consequences : first  , the worries of the Czechoslovakgroup to ensure CF preservation may well have been invain f unless the new condition can be incorporated into their sys-temo Otherwise ta device that is practically equlva-lent to a Turlng machine is not very exciting to work within computatlonal linguistic theory or its implementation  . 
Second ~ one of the advantages inherent in the use of CF-preser vlng transducers is the guaranteed existence of a whole bevy of working recognition routines  ( e . g . , the Cocke-Roblnson algorithm , the parser developed by Kay I or the predictive analyzer by Kuno  , etc . ) This advantage becomes illusory if the pdt battery produces a recursively enumerable language tio e  . one that cannot be guaranteed to be recognized by a CF-recognition routine  . 
If we think of the Czechoslovak system as part of a 
Mey6 machine translation proposal , where the route from source to " Interllngua " consists of essentially the same flow  ( but in the opposite direction ) as that from " interllngua " to target language , it appears that the consequences of an incorporation of the Ginsburg-Rose adjustment are far-reaching  . Such an incorporation could take place in two ways : either one could check the output of a particular  ( ~- th ) device , transducing from a higher ( ~- th ) to a lower ( ~- lth ) level , or from a lower ( ~- th ) to a higher ( ~? lth ) level ~ to see whether or not this output corresponds to an accepting state  ( where " higher " and ' ~ oweE " are understood to refer to deeper and more superficial structures respectively  )  ; of t alternatively , a built-lnchecking device could prevent output from being generated unless the transducer reached an accepting state after reading the input string  . So fart Sgall and his group have not sugges-ted ways to handle this problem  . 
Quite another matter is that the Praguegroup'sp ? o-posal to let the output of the ~- th de  , ice be ? pro-pers ~ bset of the input of the ~+ Ith ~ ~- Ith 
Mey 7 transducer respectively , does not seem to be fruitful , or even feasible o Naturally p the first question that arises is : what about the remaining input  , where does it all come from ? It is certainly true  , as the authors remark ( 2:2o2o5 ) ~ that " the output language of the whole descr iption is not necessarily context-free " oAS shown above  , it simply never is under the given conditions . Hence the reason given in the rest of the quote is trivial : " since ?  . . it is only a proper sub-aet of the context - free languages of the last pushdown transducer "   ( ibld . )o While it is always possible to tame a prope ~ subset of a CF language and obtain a language tha % i ~ not  C2~ or may be not even reguiar ~ that cleaxly i ~ not the point here  . The authors in ~ nd their output language to be CF ~ for reason sllk ~ the ones mentioned above ? As long as it can be shown  ( as I have done here ) that the system in no case is ( even weakly ) equivalent to a CF grammar ~ the question of the restrictions on the input to the subsequent transducer sist of course  , irrelevant to the CF character of the system as a whole  . 
Mey 84. Some theoretical implications
The proponents of the Prague model have repeated ly asserted that their system has certain advantages over other models of linguistic performance and  , in particular t that their grammar is superior ( or at least equivalent ) to transformational grammar . 
The claim that the level-based model is superior to others because of easy CF-recognitlon has been  . dispro-ved in the preceding sections . Another claim , that of greater naturalness inherent in the level -or lented model  , is also often made ( sometimes implicitly by reference to the model's stance in tlme-honored linguistic tradition  )  . It should be observed tho wever ~ that such a claim does not concern the formal character of any system  . As Chomsky has pointed out ( in his discussion of Fillmore's case theory ( 8:14-16 ) ) I it is vacuous to discuss different formal systems in terms of which is the more " direct " representation of natural language  ; unless a formal system is interpreted 0 it slmply cannot be compared to another one for " ~L rectneee " of expression  . 
But how about transformational grammar itself with
Mey 9 respect to sentence recognition ? It has been kno ~ for a long time that there is no way of establl shing a universal automatic recognition procedure for a tr~s format lonal grammar that is not in some ways restricted ? This was precisely the Prague group's motivation for proposing their system as a  ( superior ) altern at lve to TGo Now that their clalms have been de-substant lated on theoretlcal grounds  , it may seem like a meag reconsolation to the Prague ~ oup that TG itself is in the same boat  , theoretically speaking . 
In an important recent study ~ Peters and Ritch lehave demonstrated that a context-senslt lve  ( CS ) based transformational grammar ~ unless restr icted in some respect a ~ generates are curslvely enumerable language ~ and conversely  , for any recurslvely enumerable language there is a CS based TG that will generate it  ( 9:4 . 1) . 
As the authors point out ( ibido:33) , it is imperative to set out and find conditions under which a TG will generate only recurslve languages  . One such condition would be to restrict the base of a TG to be CF  ; however tt-nls will still not guarantee recursllty  ( 9:4 . 2 ) ? This is preclsely the problem that the Czechoslovak 
I workers will have to solve in order to make the lr system vlable and to vall date their claims  .
