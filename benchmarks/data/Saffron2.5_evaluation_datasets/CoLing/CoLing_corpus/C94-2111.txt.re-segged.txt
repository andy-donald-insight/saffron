Three oricntalions have \[ brinedIhc basis o1 Ihc design of tile Functior ~ al-Semall tic Proccs sor:  ( i ) the ti . ) CtlS(51' analysis is on discourse ;   ( it ) the purl xlse is Io discover lhose elements lhal conhibllle to Ih cover all ltlC ' llling conveyed by a I exl  ; ( iii ) the approach is in odular , wilh each ill Odllle corresponding to a slrt lelt lral I ' epl ' CSell\[~lliOll  \]71"O111 Oll C of Severald in ~ ensions of n leaning . ' In order to provide insighls into tile meaning and cfl'c clivcness of a text '  , stales Hall\[day (1985) , ' acliscourse granlmar needs 1o be lil51ctionaI and semal Hic in its orientation , with the gran unalical categories explaineds is the real\[sat\[onf semantic patt crns '  ( xvii )  . St , '(; provides this Ihnclional-senlanlic orientation . 
2 . SYSTEMICFUNCTION Al ,  (  ; I/AMMAR(SF ( ; ) llalliday's systemic-time\[tonal grammar ( SFG ) identifies the shll clnres ;  . 1 1 clatls e level and above thai conlribute Io the meaning  o1' a text . An SFG analysis reveals ' how and wily ' a lex\[ means what it does  . The clause , as ; coxIslilucnl(s\[th clest , ixtile coral ) los realisation ( fl three functional-senlanlic con/portents : leMtlal  , in lcq ) crsoilal and ideational .

\[n English , lexhlaln leaning is represented by the me-theme ~ . lll ( . \] inlbrmalions lrtlctllles ; inlerpcrs on allll Calling by mood-residue or exchauges l ruch lrc  ; and idealional or proposflional recants ? , by I ransifivily strllelllre . While llalliday idenlilies the clause as I\[IC most basic lexico-  , prammalical 1Hlil , nev crlhclesshciily ; t . lecol , nises and includes in his grammar olhcr discomse Ill/its beside stile clause  . I " or example , II ' alliday's notion of inlbrmalionut / it inl : " , nglish is similar to wh ; ll'\['sao ( I979 ) calls topic-chains in Chinese where a topic extends its scm:lnlic domain over several senie \ ]lcc?  . 
3 . TIlEFIJNCTIONAL SEMANTICI'ROCESSOR The Funclional Senlantic Processor is a Iool to assistin rite analysis of lexisl bllowing M  . A .

AS discussed belm ~ ( Seclion 5) ,   :1 parser is being added I0 lhel " Sl ' I0 the parser will pennil certain fields lobe preset  , lmplementalion of a bilingual version of the FSP will assist in the advancemenl of research into lhesimilarilies and differences belwecn Chinese and English texl structures  . While ttallidaylnai/llains thaifile Ihree COlllpone llS of meaning -- ideational  , interpersonalnd textual---are universal to all lang/lages  , tiles lruclures corresponding 1o these CO lllpol/ellls are , nevertheless , language specific . Thus this bilingual implementation ftile FSP includes structures and fields relew mt to Chinese and English  . Certainly there is some overlap . 
Transilivity analysis , Ibr example , facililales comparison on a generally shared level of meaning  . But there is also a great deal of difference bchveen Chinese and English  , parlicularly noliceable with respect Io exchange or Mood-residues lruchu'e  . McDonald (1992) , in his oulline of a FG for Chinese , does not recognise a separate

The Funclion a I-Selnantic Processor ( FSP ) has been developed ill . lheMS Windows3 . 11 environnl cnl . 
Chinese is handled illtile , Windows environment using PCEx press Twin Bridgev . 3 . 2 . The FSP includes three linked components : ( i ) MS Wordlor Windows v . 6 . 0 ( WinWord ) a stexl-edilor ; ( it ) the Analysl's lnler lhcE(AI ) ; and ( iii ) a database facility . From WinWord , the analyst can vicw the lexl , and select clauses for analysis . 
The AI , a Visual Basic application , is linked by means of Ol , E automalion wilh W in Word . Working within the Allth canalysl can view , edit , and save IhE contents of l \] elds on lbrm slot each of tile different kinds of slructural analysis  . Using VB's database capability , enlriEs are saved to a database . The databas entries may be relrieved liom within the AI  , or separately using MSAccess . MSAccessnlay also be used to general creporls including  , lot Example , consistelll IX lll Erns of usage occurring illl he dala  .

Tile user opens a document in W in Word , highlights the clause to be analysed , presses a button in tile toolbar labelled IFSP\] . The lexl highlighled in WmW ord now appears in the \[ Clausellexl box in the Analyst's lnterl-ilce  ( AI )  .

Transilivily analysis is concerned wilh the scmanlic configuration of process  , parlicipanl , and cit ' ClHl/Slall Ce , i . e . the clatl seas a means of rcprescnling the processes of doing  , lhinking , being , speaking , etc . 
The clause lobe analysed appears ill the\[ Clause \] textbox  . \[t has been selected from the Help file for MS Windows Write  ( Chinese and English versions )  .

The user must open a second transitivily lot to , Transitivity-\[2\] , to analyse tile clause-as-subject ( Fig ,  4) . ThEre are now two transilivity forms open as indicated by the two tabs  , but only one a clive , The tabol I heaclive folm is yellow in colour , To switch between fOrll S , tile user simply needs 1o click onlh ct a blot I hal

Once an analysis is complcl cd , it is saved 1o the database along with the name ot the document in which lhc clause appears  , the bookmarkid cnlity of the clause , and lhctype and lmmber of analysis , e . g . Transilivily-111 .
