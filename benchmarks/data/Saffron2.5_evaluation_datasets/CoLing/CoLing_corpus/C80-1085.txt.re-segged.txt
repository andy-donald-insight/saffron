Portions of natural language content must bed irectly related to memory func-tions in computers  . A system should be selected which does not only fit theo-retically but also can be pract ically  6 applied , due to its " natural " character . 
It represents a difficult task to cut a way ausable model thesaurus from the huge meaning t reasure of natural langu-sage  . Air Traffic Control Language , re-stricted to Ground Control , serves this purpose . Due to severe altime require-ment ~ al imitation to conventional com-

1 INTRODUCTION :
To substitute one partnern natural language dialogs by a computer  , a model dialog should be chosen , which uses be-sides user utterances also system alerts for input  . These alerts are triggered by the user's action  . The introduced " Standard 80" thesaurus meets these  demands . It concerns ground and ramp con-trol activi ties in ATCL dialogs between pilots and ai rcontrollers  . In those Air ~ raffic ~ ontrol Languaged i a logs taxy procedures by the user  , in this case the pilot , are in addition monito-red by sensors at the a pron  . Thus , besi-des " primary inputs " by pilot ut teran-ces also " secondary inputs " by thesy -stem help the content guided answer search mechanism  . The ATCL at interna-tional airports has been reduced to one  --559--par ticular language English-already in the fi fties  . In a minimum of time elapse a maximum of in formation flux between the dialog partners is needed  . This postulate causes all grammatical components with a low level efficiency rate to be abolished naturally  . 
Considering most recent structural evalu-at ions  , formalization results of natural " key features of content  ; KFCs ~ I~y ~ ~ a matching procedure of input KFCs with twin KFCs stored in a ROM  , prepared answers can be triggered . But , a match instruc-tion can be also used to tr igger a sequence of deuter  , which are implemented in a time-analoguous read -only array  . The trigger procedure of deuter sequences is fas ter than that of prepared answers  . 
Especially if more voluminous thesauri are used But  , up to the present , an ac-tualizing of deuter sequences is sti ll missing proper morphological agglutina-t ions  . Automatically triggered deuter sequences appear in isolated morphologies  . 
For this purpose an " algorithm of pro-
G gressive agglutination " is under consi- deration  , by which syntax particles and additional syntax rules can be mingled into deuter sequences  . For the ATCL however deuter sequences without too many syntagms are quite sufficient  .

4.4 Determining the KFCs:
Depending from the deuter-criterion : age -value  , the dialog cycles 16 from old to new are brought into relation to the sum of all potential partial dia logs  , in this case 8 . Among all cycles of the same age , frequency values and redundancies of sing-le deuter are checked  . Only a few deuter among all input data have the " switching ability " to select one of the  8 potenti-aln ext cycles . These account for less than 20% of all input data . They are cal-led " key features of content " , KFCs . 
5. ANSWERSEARCHLOGIC FOR PREPARED

The implementation array is time-analo-guos . As the input-KFCs appear also after the deuter- criterion age-value  , a realtime MP will be quite simple .

5.3 Sequential Network of AT
According to 5 . 2 , for each Partial Dialog 7 potential switching combinations are possib le  ( Fig .  2) . 
5.4 Components of the ASL
The main units consist of a ) a ROM for twin-KFCs , b ) a KFC-matcher as a comparator device to match input-KFCs with twin- 
KFCs , and c ) an AT(Fig , 3).
6 DEUTERSTRING SYNTHESIZE RDSS 6 . 1 Function of a DSS According to funct ion - and memory redundancies in ASLs  , ( Fig . 3), the units:
I ) KFCTw in ROM , 2) KFC Matcher 3) Answer Trigger , and 4) Answer Pool for Prepared Answers , are combined in a " DSS-Logic " . Not only twin-KFCs but all potential deuter in all dialogs are stored in the DSS-Logic  . 
This , in a way , substitutes the Answer Pool for prepared answers  . The read only memory implementation must be in geomet-ric " time logic "  . Thus an electrical ac-tivation of one matched twin-KFC trigge-res a sequence of surrounding stored deu-ter  . This triggering is executed by a " switsch thru -"  , a " put through connec-tion " procedure . Each actualized deuter in such a " switch thru sequence " is si-multaneously transformed into an audio output  , a synchronous " read out " The " switch thru association " becomes " loud thinking "  . This fits a logic answer to the input-KFCs . Major functions of the
DSS are:
I ) All twin-KFCs serve potential match procedures with input-KFCs  . 
2) After an input-KFC is matched , the matched twin-KFC is activated as " the fi rstdeuter " in a triggered deuter sequence  . 
3 ) The length of the sequence will be limited from  3 to I0 deuter . 
4 ) Each connected deuter in a triggered deuter sequence is allocated with  23 seconds time , in which the adequate
English utterance can be expressed by a speech synthesizer device  . 
5 ) The " switchthruconnection " to neighbouring deuter in the deuter sequence continues only  , after the English word of the last deuter is spoken out  . 
6.2 Architecture of a DSS
The array of DSS content is divided into dia log cycle sections  . For each of them five or more KFC-Match/Trigger Stations  ( Mattrigs ) are provided . Structure and organization of function units in all first dialog cycles of the eight model dialogs are shown in Fig  .   4: If such sec-tions for the remaining dialog cycles  26 of all potential dialogs are compi-led in an analoguous way and put toge-ther  , a further elimination of redundant port ions will help to create a complex 
DSS architecture.

7 Conclusion:
Function simulation of one partner in nat . lango dialogs by a machine demands the follow ing major procedures : I  ) KFC-matching of Input-KFCs with Twin-
KFCs implemented in a ROM ,  2 ) Answer Trigger according to KFC match procedures in devices with prepared answers ASLs  , and 3 ) Actualization of Deuter String Outputs in DSSs after KFC matchings  . 
More than expected , complex evaluations of nat . lang . phenomena were necessary for memory array purposes  . Among them particularly the six deuter-c riteria  . 
But also a sufficient familiarity with the applied thesaurus was necessary  .
