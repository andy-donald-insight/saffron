We want to show , through linguistic argmnents , that the best semantic rcl ~ resentation ( ~ LI ; least for sentential ncg a . tion ) giw~s negation a wide scope over events or states  , and that the syntactic results correspond with the semantic ones  .

Mohm dijk , 1994), for instance.
29 an aspectual operator , but rather as having wide scope over the eventuality  , as exemplified by the DRSK lb . This position is the one defended in ( Kmnp and Reyle ,  1993) . 
We first review the arguments in favour of our view  , and then summarize the discussion presented in ( Amsili and Le Draoulec ,  1996 ) against the counterarguments to this view presented in  ( de Swart and Molendijk ,  1994) . We summarize our semantic proposal in the section  2  . 3 . 
Simplicity . One of the reasons wily we may prefer the representation KlbtOK ~ b is that it is simpler  , from the technical point of view . Thus , if such a representation is sufficient to account for all the data we want to account for  , then there is no need for a more complex representation like tile one exemplified in K~b  . Another point worth noting is that , the second proposal is also more complex from the ontological point of view  . Adding new types of discourse referents like ~ in the language of DRS requires that we define their ontological properties  . And since these new kinds are defined in terms of other skinds of discourse referents  , this may well be a nontrivial task . 
Negation in discourse . The ideas developed in this paragraph are based on a study of negation in discourse currently in progress  . The aim of this study is to see how negation interferes with socalled discourse relations  ( continuation , elaboration , explanation . . . ) . To do this , we are using a large corpus taken from French contemporary literature  . We shall not describe this study in detail here ; nevertheless , one of its findings is relevant to our discussion . 
We have looked at examples involving French pass g simple  ( PS , simple past ) . This tense typically introduces an event rather than a state  . We have a set of 1399 examples of sentential negation , in which one find only 46 occurrences of PS . 
Among these examples , a majority are of the form exemplified in (3) . 
(3) a . Jeneluir fipon dispas.
I didn't answer him.
b . ~ Ellenesurs autapas.
She didn't startle.
Thus , in a majority of cases , PS+negation seems to be used to assert , the absence of an event , and it is very difficult in those cases to find a " real event " which could be seen as denoted by the sentence  . 
3 cases in the corpus seem however to suggest that negated event sentences may denote events :  ( 4 ) a . Ellenele voulut pas . 
She didn't want it.
b . L ' autrene prit pasded ~ tour.
The other didn't mince words.
c . Ellenese laiss a pas faire.
She didn't letthings flow.
Thus , one can easily imagine that ( 4a ) " refers to " a gesture , or some kind of behaviour that could be interpreted as a refusal  . Here , of course , this reflmal could probably be associated with ~ . 
But these examples are rare ; moreover , the two last sentences of ( 4 ) involve more or less idiomatic expressions , so that it seems quite reasonable to see negation here as part of a conventionalised expression  ( " hepasselaisser faire " denoting an event , just like the verb to refuse does ) . 
Events can be defined as a change of state.
With this definition in mind , we think that , at least in the case of PS , negation over events is used mostly to convey something like " nothing changed "  , or " the expected event didn't occur " , and there is in this case no event denoted by tile sentence  . There remain some cases ( very few ) where such sentence seem to denote some real change of the background  , but then we claim that negation is lexically incorporated  , and no longer sentential . 
The classical example . We come now to the " classical " example of ( Kamp and Reyle ,  1993) . 
It involve stile following discourses : (5) a . Mary looked at Bill . He smiled . 
b . Mary looked at Bill . He was smiling.
c . Mary looked at Bill . He didn't smile.
d . Mary looked at Bill . He was n't smiling.
The pair ( 5a-5b ) exemplify the contrast between simple past and progressive past in narrative discourse  . In the second sentence of (5a ) , the simple past introduces a new event , , which is localised after tile event introduced in the previous sentence  . In constrast , the second sentence of (5b ) introduces a state , which overlaps with the event of the previous sentence  . This analysis givestile correct prediction for the contrast : in  ( 5a )  , Bil's smiling is interpreted as a reaction to Mary's looking at Bill  , thus following it , whereas in (5b ) , Bill was already smiling when Mary looked at him . 
The contrast in ( 5 c-5d ) is clearly parallel to that in ( 5a-5b )  . Since the second sentence of ( 5d ) call reasonably be thought of as introducing a state  , also introducing a state for the second ( negative ) sentence of ( 5c ) would lead us to lose the contrast , since this would suggest , for both sentences that Bill was not smiling when Mary looked at him  . 
Counter-arguments . We summarize here the discussion given in ( Amsili and Le Draoulec ,  1996 ) against some of tile arguments given in favour of the idea  , that negative sentences denote an eventuality . There are two main arguments . One is based on the fact that negated event sentences accept durative complements  ( whereas their positive counterpart do not )  , this fact being taken as an argument in favour of the aspectual role of negation  . 
Our answers are : first , some French data suggest that durative complements with negation should e'ity of the predicate  ; second , Kamp and Reyl . s ( 1993 ) representation provides a satisfying way to account t br such data  . The second argument is based on examples ill which an anaphoric reference see  , ms to be made to the denotation of negative sentences  , therefore suggesting that they have one . But these data are rather constrained , in such a way that it seems that tile discourse referent at stake is an abstract one  , nm nely a fact , and not an event/state . 
2.3 Proposal
We can now state 1; het ) rol ) os al , ill the ternls of ( Kamp and Reyle ,  1993 , p .  548) . Roughly , the interpretation of a negated sentence induces the following steps illtile construction of a DRS : ? introduction of a location time t  ; ? introduction of a condition relating t with the speech time n  ; ? introduction of a con ( lition saying that there is no event or state of a certain l  ; yl ) e which stands in the relation ' C ' or '0'/ . ot . 
As an example , the diseom's e(5c ) will receive the represenl ; atioil (6) , the most relevant points of which being , first , that a temporal constant ( t ) is systematically introduced into the representation  , and second , that negation has widescope over event/state discourse referents  , t remaining outside negation .

We adopt the representations envisioned by classical Govermnent and Binding Theory  ( hereafter GB , Chomsky (1981; 1986)) . Severals l ; u dies on the structure of I , ~' ench clauses , and illt ) articular , negative sentences , have been carried out recently ill this framework by Pollock  ( 1989 ;  1993) , Hir-shbiihler and Labelle (1993 ; 1994a ) and Pearce (1994) among others . In this section , we adopt some of their most relevant results . 
We are mainly concerned with two of the four levels of representation of GB  , namely D-Structure and S-Structure . Tile representations of tiles ( ; two levels are trees . D-structures represent basic lexical properties uch as thematic relations  . S-structures represent more superficial propertie such as case  , binding , etc . S-structures derive fi'om D-structures via Move-a : they are the result of movements that take place in tile latter  . 
In this section , we attemp to answer the following two questions :   ( 1 ) what is the D-structure of French negative clauses ?  ( 2 ) which move . ments take place between D-Structure and S - Structure ?  3  . 1 Split Inflexion Hypothesis The . l Prench clause representations we use are rather classical  . They satisfy X'-theory , which uses wellknown syntactic oncepts independent of any theoretical Damework  . % represent clauses and to build their DRSs , we use a tree structure consisting of a verb phrase VP dominated by tile projection iP of a functional head I bearing the verbal tense and agreement features  ( I stands for inflezion )  . IP has the sentence subject NP as its specitier and the  . VI ' as the complement of its head . The sentence is therefore represented as an " inftcxional phrase  . "'\[' hismW be illustrated by the S-structure ( 7b ) of sentence ( 7a )  ;   ( 7b ) In kyalsober et ) reseuted as the labelled bracketing giwmill ( 7C )  . 2(7) a .

IIt Marcc . lip\[NPJulie\]\[~ , \[ I\[vl regard-\][ , - ell\[VP\[v , \[ v , t , \]\[NI'Mm'c\]\]\]\]\]Pollock(1989) , starting from this general structure , gives a new insight into the problem , by showing the beuefits of splitting the complex in-flexional category I into two distinct flmctional categories  , namely tense ( T ) and verb agreement ( Agr ) . The general structure of French clauses that Pollock  ( 1989 ) proposes is ( 8a )  , so that for instance (7b ) becomes (8b ): (8) a . \[ TpNI'rp\[Agrt . . . . Agr \[ VP ( AdvP ) VP \]\]\] b . \[' rl'\[NPJulie\]\[~, . , \[7'/ regarde \] \[ Ag , -l'\[Agr'\[Agrit\]\[vp\[v , Iv , t\]\[m'Mare\]\]\]\]\]\]\]3 . 2 Negation ( Pollock , 1989) also claims that negation , like tense and verb agreement , is represented as a func-l;ional category , Neg , located between T and Agr . 
2Note that the morphological decomposition of the verb  , shown in (7b ) , will not be . made explicit in tile following representations . 

In French , this category contains the negative item ne , seen as a weak affix lacking morphological stress  . In S-Structure , nemust adjoin to the verb as a clitic . More generally , it must raise to T in finite clauses as well as infinitives  . 
This proposal has been accepted by many linguists . However , there is no similar consensus about the position in D-Structure and the possible movements of the second element of French negation  , namely one of the adverbs p as , plus , point , guSt'e , etc . Here we adopt the proposal of ( Hirschbiihler and Labelle ,  1993 ) which states that p as ( or any of the other negative adverbs ) is an adjunct to the maximal projection governed by Neg  . Since Ncg is located between T and Agr , this projection is AgrP . The general structure of alq-ench negative clause is therefore :\[ TPNPT\[NegPNeg\[ agrPAgr\[vl '  ( AdvP ) VP\]\]\]\]a . a The Aspeetual Dimension of Agr The previous clause structure improves significantly the correspondence bt ween syntactic representation and semantic interpretation  . In particular , it becomes easier to differentiate the semantic contribution of each element hat is relevant at the aspectuo-temporal level  . These elements fall into two categories : those below negation  ( and therefore inside its scope ) and those above negation . 
Following ( de Preitas , 1994; Borer , 1993; Latca ,  1990) , we consider Agr to be rather an aspectual category Aspin charge of the aspectual dimension of the semantic representations  . This dimension is introduced by discourse referents  . Recall that DRT discourse referents do not serve only to account for this aspectual dimension  , but do play a fundamental discursive role . Nevertheless , the categorisation i to states ( s ) and events ( e ) of the utterances to bc represented , and the possible introduction of the discourse referents of one of these aspectual category  , may be associated with the Asphead . This association gives us the ex-peeled result : the discourse referenteors is in the scope  ( in the sense of DRS construction ) of the possible negation . 
These elements are all illustrated in the corn -plete syntactic representation of the sentence  ( 9 ) given in figure 2 . Notice the attachment of the sentential adverb aujourd'hui as adjunct to TP  , the highest projection of the representation . Because of space limitation , we cannot develop this point here and refer the reader to  ( Amsili ,  1994) .

4 Bottom-up construction
We now integrate the semantics and the syntax of sentential negation  . We show in this last section that both representations fit together in the framework of a bottom-up construction procedure  , which allows a satisfactory computational treatment of negation  . We use the method proposed in ( Asher ,  1993) , presented in section 4 . 1 , and then show how this nmthod can be applied to the representations discussed earlier  . 
4.1 Principle
The construction procedure is bottom-up . DR-theoretic expressions are associated with leaves  , and then combined to form the final DR , S . The combinatorial method used here is A -conversion  , with two kinds of ~- expressions , namely predicative DRSs and partial DRSs . We associate verbs and nouns with 1 ) redicatiw ~ DRSs ( for instance , the verb voir ( see )) yields Aa : kyvoir(x , y )) , the role of which is to introduce predicates into the representation  . In constrast , discourse ret ~ rents are only present in the form of DR-variables  ; they will be introduced by the partial DRSs . The translation of noun phrases ( NP ) or determiners is quite close to that of the Montagovian tradition  . A determiner is associated with a partial DRS , which is , so to speak , what remains of a DRS when one takes away a predicative DRS  . As a consequence , there will be variables over predicative DRSs ( PDRS-variables ) in partial DRSs . A partial DRS can also contain a declared discom 'se referent  . This discourse referent is meant to serve as an argument of the predicative DRS which will be assigned to one PDRS-wxriable during the conversion  . In ( 10 ) we give a graphical representation of a simple and general case of A-conversion  .

We have i1o room here to elaborate oi1 the details of the construction procedure ; we refer the reader to ( Asher ,  1993) , and give in figure 1 a complet example ( with a simpliiied syntactic representation )  , for the sentence (11) .

We have seen that the representation of time in DRT makes us  ( ' . of two discourse referents ( at least ) . It is thus necessary to determine in both cases which nod  (  ; will be in charge of introducing the discourse referent  . The pure temporald in mn-sion , which is accounted for by the time referent ; t , will be introduced at the node T . The aspectual dimension , which is accounted for at the semantic level by the discourse referente/s  , is associ-

5 Conclusion
This work shows the convergence of diil'erent approaches  , fi'(/m the syntax/semantic nter face point ; of view . From a semantic point of view , it is possible , to i ) ropose a semanti ( : ret ) resent a-tion of temporal negation , and this representation matches in a way re ( : ent results in generative syntax , so that it is possible to offer a computationally realistic treatment of this interact \] ira  , without any tradeoff froin the linguistic point of view  .
