The primary objective of this paper is to describe an experiment 
designed to investigate the semantic relationships between the three 
basis components of a prepositional construct : the governor  , preposi-
tion and the complement . Because of the preliminary nature of the
experiment , only simple data processing equipment , such as the key punch and the sorter , was used . The implementation of this approach on a larger scale  , however , would necessitate the use of more sophisticated hardware  . 
The described procedure uses Russian prepositions because  , while working on this problem , the author was a research staff member of the Russian English mechanical translation group at IBM's Thomas J  . Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights , New York . 
While the described procedure presents a tentative approach  , which does not offer a solution to the semantic ambiguities within pre-positional constructs in Russian  , it does suggest a method for exa-mining each basic component of a given construct in relation to other constructs containing different types of prepositions  . 
The data used in the model was collected mainly from the Soviet Academy of Sciences Grau ~ ar and  , to some extent , from the Soviet Aca-demy of Sciences Dictionary . Initially an attempt was also made to compile data from other dictionaries  . It was found , however , that the presentation and the classification of the data was not detailed enough for the purposes of this study  . Theref Ore , only some of the prepositions not listed as such in the previously named sources were included in the experiment  . The next logical step , using the arrangement of the data as shown below , should be the culling out of additional data in the case of Russian  , and complete data in the case of other languages ~ from dictionaries  , concordances and random texts . Following various sorting patterns , the results should then be tested through generative processes and checked against concorded'real life'examples  . 
General Purpose
As stated earlier , the purpose of the proposed approach is the establishment of patterns of sementic correlations between : I  . Given Governor and its Preposition G ( - - - - ~ P ( left boundaries )  2 . Given Preposition and its Complement P~--"' ) C ( right boundaries )  3 . Given Governor and its l > reposition's G~----~C

These relationships can be diagrarmned as follows : ~ ~   ( C ) sn bl where sn = sematic property of any value . 

If either of the semantic components is found to exclusively govern the combination of the two remaining semantic components then it can be said that  ( G ) sn ? ( C ) sn + ( P ) sn = Sx where Sx = valid semantic pattern = sum of semantic properties of  ( G ) sn ( C ) sn and ( P ) snW here confirmed , the established semantic patterns can be incorporated into a lookup table as an additional tool for parsing procedures and for testing the validity of class-members hlp within pre -positional phrases  . Where not confirmed or where the patterns are not clear  , further refinement of the semantic properties of the components in question must be carried out  . 
Method of Procedure
Following the classification provided by the Academy of Sciences Grammar  ( henceforth referred to only as Grammar )  , prepositional cons-tructs were coded according to the grammatical category of their governors and the type of relationship  ( henceforth referred to only as TR ) with their complement . The following governor categories were recognized : noun  , verb , adjective , adverb , numeral . 
Next , the governors as well as the complements were coded ac-~cording to their semantic properties from examples provided by the  -3-Grammar   . This semantic classification was , in a sense , arbitrary in that it did not attempt to map the universe of all Russian words in the five governor categories  , but tended to accomodate only those complements and governors contained in the examples  , and only if their characteristics seemed relevant  . Thus , if the Grammar provided two examples of the usage of the preposition and the semantic properties of respective governors and complements were clearly identical  , only one example was selected . The listing of these constructs in the five governor categories is given in Appendix I  . 
Since , in an initial study of this type , a large number of semantic classes might tend to obscure the existence of possible patterns  , an attempt was made to keep the number of these classes at a minimum  . 
As stated earlier ~ the adoption of this approach in an extensive study of constituents within prepositional constructs would require more elaborate semantic mapping  . For the purposes of this study , the total number of semantic classes for nouns was narrowed to  24  , for verbs 9 and 6 for adjectives .   ( See Appendix II ) The classification of numerals and adverbs as governors was abandoned when it was discovered that  , according to the examples provided by the Graummr  , their semantic values in no instance effected the selection of a complement of a given semantic category  . Thus the -4-# examples citing the usage of cardinal , ordinal and indeterminate numbers such as ' ~ ECKO ~ KO " showed that these governors may  c0-occur with a complement of any class . A similiar phenomenon was observed in the behavior of adverbs acting as governors  . It is possible that a more detailed study of a large corpus will reveal the existence of de -finite relationships  . 
The total number of types of relationships ( TR ) abstracted from the Gra~mmr was 42 ( see Appendix Ill )  . Since some of the prepositions , especially of the compound or adverbial type , were not provided by the Grammar with an example of their usage in a given TR  , the latter was derived through transformational cross-reference from the Academy of Sciences Dictionary  , and when that proved impossible , it was supplied by the native speaker of Russian employed by the Project  . 
In order to fit the data for each TR on a single iBM card  ( for easier sorting )  , those TRs which seemed somewhat redundant or insufficiently documented were combined and the total number of TRs was reduced to Ii  . Again , while the TRs were translated literally from the Gramsmr  ( admitedly , some of the translations seem a little awkward , e . 
g . ' togetherness') , the reduction of their total number was an arbitra-ryar rangement aimed at simplifying the overall research procedure  . 
The manner in which the 43 TRs were reduced to II is shown in Appendix



The IITRs used in the final analysis are as follows : I  . Attributive 7 . TR expressing togetherness 2 . Temporal 8 . similarity 3 . Spatial 9 . deprivation 4 . Purpose I0 . conformity 5 . Causative II . comparison 6 . Objective In addition to the aforementioned , the following data was added to every construct :
