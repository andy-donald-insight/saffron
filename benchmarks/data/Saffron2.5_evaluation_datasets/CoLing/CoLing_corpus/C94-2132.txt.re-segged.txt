In order to construct systems wl fich can pro ( ' css natural language in a sophisticated fashion it is highly desirable to be able to rel  ) resent linguistic meanings in a comlmtationally tractable fashion  . Onea , ppro~ch to the problem of capturing meanings ~ t t the lcxi <: allevel is to use a form of distributed representation where each word meaning is converted into a point in an n -dimenskmal space  ( Sutcliff c , 1992a ) . Such rel ) -resentations can capture a wide variety of word meanings within the same for lnalism  . In addition they can be used within distributed representations \[ brcapturing higher level information such as that expressed I  ) y sentences ( Sutcliff c , 1991a ) . Moreover , they can be scaled to suit a particular tradeoil " of speciticity and memory usage  ( Sutclilfi ~ , 1991b ) . Hnally , distributed representations can be processed conwmiently by vector processing methods or connectionist algorithms and can be used either as part of a symbolic system  ( Sutclitl ~ , 1992b ) or within a eonnectionist architecture ( Sutcliffe ,  1988) . In previous work we have shown how such representations can be constructed automatically by the method of taxonomic tr~L versal  , using tire Merriam Webster Compact Electronic die -- tionary  ( Sutcliffe ,  1993 ) ~md the Irish-Irish An Focldir Beag ( Sutcliffe , McElligott and ONdill ,  1993) . I lowever our effort so far have I ) e enlimited by our parsing technology to lexicons of a few thousand words  . We describe here how we can geler ; M , e a lexical entry for any of the 71 , 000 nouns 2 in the Princeton WordNet ( Beckwith , Fetlbaum , (\] rossmM Miller ,  1992) , and the initial tests we have conducted on the representations  . 
Our method is closely related to other work which exploits the taxonomic nature of dictionary detini-tions  ( Amsler , 1980; I lied or n , Byrd and (~ hodorow , t986; Vossen , 1990; Guthrie , Slator , Wilks and I/ruce , 1990; Nutter , Fox and Evens ,  1990) . In addition there . 
have already been some very interesting al ) l ) roaehes to the construction of distributed semantic representations either from dicl  , ionaries ( Wilksel , el . , t990) or fl'om corpora ( Schuetze , 1993) .

TATIONS ' l'he object of our work is to produce for each n  ( )un sense in a lexicon a semantic reprcscntation consist  . 
ing of a set of tim . lure-centrality p ~ firs . The lhatures are semantic attributes each of which says something about the concept being defined  . ' Phe centrality associated with each feature is ; ureal mmd ) er which in -- dicatcs how strongly the feature contributes to the meaning of the concept  . The use of centralities allows us to distinguish I  ) et we cn important and less importautti ; atures in a semantic rel ) resentation . By scaling the centralities in a particular noun -sense representation so that tirestun of their squares is one we can use the  ( lot productol ) eration to compute the sen , anticsimila . rity of a pair of cone el ) ts . A word CO lnpared to itself always scores Ol Le while a word compared to another word is always less than or equal to one  . This is equivalent to saying that each word representation is a vector of length one in an n -dimensional space  , where n is then mn be r of features which are used in the lexicon as a whole  . 
Our algorithm for constructing the representations is based on two wellknown observations  . Firstly , a word definition in a dictionary provides attribute in-I'ormation about the COlmept  ( ' ailia . still ' is a LAR (31'; dog') . Secondly a word delinition also provides tax ( > nomic information about the concept ( ' a mast iff isi ~ large DOG ' )  . We use the former to derive attributes for our representation  , and the latter tool ) tain other definitions higher up in the taxonomy from which fur--therattril  ) utes can be obtained . In assigning centralities to % aturcs , we use the same value for each attribute added at a particuli ~ r level in the taxonomic hierarchy  , and we reduce the value used as we move u1 ) to higher levels . This corresponds I , othe intuition that a feature which is derived from a delinitioa which is close to the word of interest in the taxonomy contri /  ) utes more to its meaning than one which is derived from a more distanu detinition  . 
The Princeton WordNet is very suitable l bruse in iml  ) lementing our extraction algorithm because taxo nomic links are represented explicitly by pointers  . In most Mll ) s such links have to be deduced by synta ( > tic and semantic analysis of sense detinitions . Nouns in WoMNet are organised around synsels . I !; a ch synset may in elmle a list of synonyms , pointers to hyponym and hypernym synsets , and a gloss con'e-sponding to a conventional dictionary definition  .

The extraction algorithm starts with the synset corresponding to the word sense for which we wish to create a lexieal entry  . ' l ? he gloss is tokenised , function words are removed and tire relnaining content words are converted to their rootrailer  ( ion . All such words are considered to be real , ares of the word sense , and are given a centrality of 1 . 0 . We then chain at ) war ( Is using a hypernymic link ( if any )  3 . At the . next level up , features are extracted from the hypernym's gloss , nsing a centrality of 0 . 9 . The process is repeated , reducing the centrality by 0 . 1 at each level , until either the top of tire hierarchy is reached or the centrality falls to zero  . Finally , the rel ) resent at . ion , consisting of a set of feature-centrality l ) airs , is normalised . 
3 RESULTS
The Mgorithm deseril ) ed above has helmim t ) hmmnted and can be used to construct a lexical entry for any of the nouns in the WordNet database  . Figure 1 shows the synset hypernym hierarchy for titile word ' terrier ' in WordNet  . Figure 2 shows the semantic representation derived by the algorithm for this word  . We present here some preliminary exl ) eriments whic . hattemp to measure the performance of the lexicon  . Four words were chosen fi'om each of live categories of noun w l f i  ( ' . hwelabel cars , clogs , /lowers , trees midpeol ) le . These are shown in Table I . Talrle 2 shows a Sllllll/lary of tile characteristics of the word representations i the set of twenty words  . Pairs of categories were eho-soil , cars-dogs , flowers-trees all d so ( )\[1~ each containing eight words . A series of eighl . -by-eight tables was then computed , showing the dot l ) roduct of each word with every other word in the category pair  . Table 3 shows the results for the curs-dogs matrix . There are several points to note about this table  . I :' irstly , the match of one car word with another is high , ranging between 0 . 58 and 1 . 0 with an average of 0 . 8 . This shows that the lexicon hascal ) tured the similarity between the earcone el ) ts . Secon(lly , the match of one dog word with another is also high  , ranging I ) et w cen 0 . 63 and 1 . 0 with an average of 0 . 76, for the same festoon . Thirdly , the lnate h of a car word with a clog word is low , ranging between 0 . 05 and 0 . 17 with an average of 0 . t . This is heea use cars and dogs are not closely linke  . d semantically . Tal ) le4 shows re-suits for the flowers-trees matrix . Flowers and trees are much more closely related semantically thau cars and dogs  , and this is rellected in the results . Hower words match with tree words in a range of 0 . 30 to 0 . 67 aAt . we sent , we only clmosc the firs ( , such link if there are several . 
with an average of 0 . 4, n~mchigher than for carsm~d dogs . The match of flowers with tlowers or trees with trees continues to be high  . Finally , Tabh ; 5 shows the people-dogs matrix . Note here thai ; the match of people with themsel we si lower than that of  ( logs with themselves ( average 0 . 63 rather than average 0 . 76 . ) This is because tile people words are in fact a rather disparate set  . Note in particular that ' bruiser ' against ' rake ' is the best lnatch while ' bruiser ' against ' patri-arch ' is the worst  . This matches one's intuitions abont these concepts : patriarchs are " good " while ' hruisers ' all  ( lq ' akes ' arc not . 
4 CONCLUSIONS
We have presented a simph ' , algorithm which allows a set of distributed lexical semantire presentations to be constructed from nouns in the Princeton WordNet  . 
'\[' he result show that the method works and produces good results  . The main reason for this is the explicit taxonomic information in WordNet which has to be inferred in other dictionaries  . Incorrect axonomic information seriously degrades the pex\[brrnanee of this Idml of method  . On the other hand errors in individual features arc not so harmful as they have  . no knock on effects . I lowever , we are engaged in eliminating errors in word sense and syntactic category which are the princilm l sources of in accuracy in the method  . In addi ; ionwea . reworking on objective methods for nw . asl , ring the perfornmnce of the lexicon on a large scale  .
