This paper describes a possi-
bility of expressing ordering con-stra ints among non-sister constituents in binary branching syntactic structures on a local basis  , supported by viewing the binary branching st ructure as a list  ( rather than a tree ) of constituents within HPSG-style grammars . The core idea of such a description of order ing is consti-tuted by creating a type latt ice for lists  . The possibilities of expressing d if ferent approaches to word order in the framework are briefly discussed  , exemplified and compared to other methods . 
In the standard immediate-con-stituent based approaches  , the " free " word order I is described either directly in the phrase-structure  ( PS ) rules , which thus express simultane-ously both dominance  ( mother/daughter ) relations and precedence ( ordering ) relations between syntactic categories , or , in more recent formalisms such as GPSG or HPSG , by the linear precedence ( LP ) rules creating a separate component of the grammar  , whose other component is the set of immedi-ate- dominance  ( ID ) rules . In both these cases , the ordering constraints are limited to sister constituents  , i . e . 
they are strictly local.
One of the problems of both these variations of the standard PS-approach is the description of adjuncts  ( free modifiers )   . On the usual assumption that their number per clau-seis in principle not limited  ( though finite for a particular clause )  , an approach to their ordering presuppos-ing them to be all sister constituents laust necessari lypresuppose also an  ( at least potentially ) in finite set of generative rules ( e . g . , a set induced by a K leene star used in a " basic " var iant of one of the rules  )  . 
In languages whose grammar allows for more word order freedom than English  2  , it is often the case that adjuncts and complements of a head  ( typically , but not solely , of a fi-nite verb ) can be freely intermixed , which makes the approach where the lo-cality of LP constraints forces the head as well as its modifiers  ( both complements and adjuncts ) be expanded as sisters still less attract ive  . 
Another possibility of de-scription of word order is the " topo-logical " approach used predominantly in more traditionally o riented German linguistics  . Applied to German , this approach divides a clause into several word order " fields "  ( " Vorfeld " , " Mittelfeld " , " Nachfeld " , " linke/rech-te Satzklammer " ) whose mutual position is fixed , and studies mainly the word order regular it ies within these " fields "  . Though a lot of work has been done and many va luable insights presented within this paradigm  , seen from the viewpoint of computation all inguistics this approach has the fatal di sadvantage that it is ex-tremely difficult to formalize within the standard frameworks  ( e . g . , none of the " f ie lds " with the poss ib le exception of " V or feld " creates a con-sti tuent in any usual sense etc  . ) . 
A San alternative to the two basic approaches mentioned above  ( as a modification of the first one , in fact ) , the description based on binary right-branch ing structures has been proposed independently in several works concerned with languages ex-Aca ~ sDE  COL1NG-92  , NANTES , 2328 AO~'T 1992 184 PROC .

Jn German , in ( Gunji , 1987) for
Japanese and in ( Avgustinova and Ol/-va , 1990) for ( mainly ) Slavic languages . However , the price paid for the removal of some problems , mainly , the free intermixing of heads , complements and adjuncts , of the abovementioned more standard descriptions is rather high-at least two problematic points arise due to the strict binarity of the structure  . The first of them is the fact that in binary structures no LP-rules relying on the relation " being sister constituent " can be used for ordering heads  , complements and adjuncts in cases this is required  , since these are not sisters any more . The second problematic point can be seen at best at the variant of the formalism given in  ( Avgustinova and Oliva ,  1990 ) the occurrence of the phonologically empty rightmost element of the branching  3   ( cf . the structure ( 1 ) for the string " John kissed Mary yesterday " )  . 

The former problem concerning word order is in the majority of the binary-branching approaches  ( as far as they are at all concerned with it ) solved by introducing word order mechanisms which are either of nonlocal nature or which burden the syntactic categories  ( understood as feature bundles ) with otherwise unmotivated features used solely for the purpose of imposing ordering constraints  ( and most often , with a combination of the two ) . 
Neither approach is more fortunate than the other -nonulocality is su-rely an unwished phenomenon in the description  , and the presence of special ordering features in the categories is hardly better  , i . a . also because order is a property of the syntactic structure  ( made of categories ) rather than of the categories themselves4 . 
This paper will try to show that in spite of the abovementioned reservations the " binary branching " can be a correct and fruitful approach to syntactic description if seen from a slightly different viewpoint  . In order to get the proper perspective , let us observe the " binary branching " structure for the example sentence " The small boy a tean apple " shown in  ( 2 )   . 
There are several things to be taken into consideration here  . 
The most obvious among them is the division of the structure into " levels "- contiguous sequences  . of no-des with identical marking . Thus one , , dj ( . . . . 1 ,1/ \ ~ f ~ o NP ~ x~P

Further , it can be observed that each of the " levels " has one  ( and only one ) other distinguished element somewhere in a non-final position-it is the V element for the " VP-level " and the N elements for the " NP-levels "  , in other words each level has a head , 
It is also worth remarking that the levels of the binary branching have a direct relation to more usual approaches  . Thus , the standardi ~ edi-ate-constituent tree ( 3 ) for the sentence from ( 2 ) can be obtained by fac-torizing ( collapsing ) the NP nodes from the respective NP-levels into a single one  , and by factorizing all the
VP-nodes except for the uppermost " sential " one  .

The dependency tree ( 4 ) of the same sentence can be then obtained by col -lapsing all nodes of a level plus its head into a single node  .

The most striking observation concerning the syntactic structures of the kind exemplif ied in  ( 2 )  , however , is the nature of their data type : showing a str ict binary right-directed branching and having a distinguished  ( by its phonological emptiness ) node as their final element , they are in fact nothing but lists 5 . 
Adopting this view brings along several advantages : - first  , the syntactic structure is strictly uni form - and also simpler than the general tree structure  , with all ( mainly practical ) consequences following from this second , the overall usage of lists ( whose members may be lists again ) brings back the notion of locality of syntact ic description-each list used in the st ructure  ( i . e . , each " level " of the st ructure as d iscussed above  ) constitutes a local domain , creating thus also a natural area of applicat ion of local constraints  ( such as subcategorization , linear precedence etc . ) - third , such an approach allows for merging both the syntactic and the topological approaches in a single formal description  , keeping , however , the two components clearly separated - the categorial information being expressed by means of  ( syntactic and other ) features and their bundles ( attribute-value matrices )   , the topo-logical information being expressed by means of refinement of kinds of lists and their elements and sublists  . 
Thus , given fairly usual as-sumptions about the nature and func-tion of constituents in a phrase  , the general type 6 for nonempty lists from ( 5 ) is to be split into subtypes shown in ( 6 )   ( where minor covers consti-tuents made of cemplementizers  , particles etc . ) .

Introduction of more fine-grained subtypes may be needed also for the final element of a list  ( usually n ? 1 )  ; the respective subtypes should mirror the kinds of phrases used as functions of the " levels " of the syntactic structure  , giving thus rise , e . g . , to types end of np , end of vp etc . 
\[\] sing a different form of structural representation enforces also using different form  ( but not different background intuitions ) of rules and principles of the grammar , all of them corresponding to the types of l is ts as introduced in the immediately preceding text  . 
Thus , the Head Feature Principle ( HFP ) is to be expressed as a conjunc-tion of two impl ications  7   ( rather than a single implication , combining conjunctively with other princip les of the grammar  )  , one describing the case where the first element of the respective nonempty  8 list is the head of the respective phrase ( " level " )  , the other one describing the rest of the cases .

Assuming the version of HPSG using sets ( rather than lists ) as values of the feature subcat , the Subcategori-zation Principle has to consist of four implications  , each for a parti-cular configuration in the syntactic list  9   . The first part describes the impact of an expansion of a complement  , the second the impact of an ex-pansion of a head  ( consisting just in copying the subcategorizat ion of the head into a special head feature head subcat  , with the aim of inherit-ing the information about the subcategorization of the head consti -tuent into the final element of the respective list via the HFP  )  , the third the impact of an expansion of an adjunctor of a minor category  , and the last one expresses the requirement that the subcahegorization of the final element of the phrase  , covering no syntactic material , be equal to the subcategorization of the head of the phrase  .   ( The effect of the second and the fourth implicat ion taken together is worth comparing with the above-mentioned condition from works by Uszkoreit and Gunji  , namely that the verb-the source of the subcatego-rization stand at the end of the clause  . )  ( 8 ) Subcategorization Principle\[first:\[ complement\]\]=>~irst:Fynsem:subcat:  i21 Ill 1 ~ est:synsem:subcat:Ill u12l &\[first:\[head\]\]=>~ynsem:cat:head : head subcat:  I1   1 ~ irst:synsem:subcat:ill&\[first:\[not ( head ) & not ( complement ) \]\]=> ~ ynsem:subcat:IIII

Assuming further a phonological principle stating that the phonology of constituents of the type nil  ( and of all its subtypes ) is empty while phonology of all other consti tuents is the combination I ? of phonologies of their first and rest subconstituents  , this approach allows for reduction of the number of grammar schemata  ( " rules " ) describing the eategorial structure to one ( similarly as in
Gunji , 1987) having the gross shape shown in (9).

The word order constraints , on the other hand , can be expressed within the hierarchy of sorts of lists used in the system  , by means of which the ordering information is not only kept separated from the categor Jal one  , but is also formulated in local domains ( each constituted by a llst ) only .

The practical usage of the idea of using the sort hierarchy of lists for the purpose of express ing word order constraints will be no will u -strated on an example  . In this example , the symbol "==" will be used for defining the type hierarchy  . The typestanding on the left-hand side of the " ~' will be a supertype of the types t and ing on its right-hand side  . As ( i0 ) \[ clause\]==\[verb first_clause\]v\[verb second clause\]v\[verblast clause\]the example proper  , let us take a slightly simplified system of German word order as used in the " field " -based approach  , and let us assume for the moment that the sorts f inite verb  , nonfinite verb , complement and adjunct are primitives ( though , obviously , in reality they arenet ) . The description of the word order of the clause then may look like as shown in  ( 10 )  . 
\[ verb_first clause\]==pirst:\[ finite_verb\]  1 Lrest : \[ middle_field and rest fields "\[ verb second_clause\]==~firet:\[forefield \]   1 
Lrest :\ [ verb_first_clause ? last cl . . . . \] == \[ first : \[ verbal_modifi~r \] l \[ v~rb

Vr first :\ [ verbal modifier 1 est:\[afterfield\]\[verbal modifier \] == \[ complement \] 
V\[adjunct\]"
The first definition in ( i0 ) describes the fact that a clause is either a verb-first clause  , a verb-second clau-se or a verb-last clause . The next three definitions describe the word crder within these kinds of clauses  . 
The definitions of verb-first and verb- second clauses are quite simple  , specifying only the types of the first and rest features of the respective syntactic lists  . The definition of verb-last clauses expresses the fact that they can consist either of a verbal modifier followed by  ( the rest of the ) verb-last clause , or of a finite verb , which cannot be followed by any syntactic material  11   . The last four definitions express actually the " field " approach to the German sent-ence  . The first of them states that the forefield consists of a verbal modifier  , which , in turn , is defined as being either a complement or an adjunct  ( in the last definition )   . The specification of middle field ( and contingent following parts of the clause ) says that the it can contain first of all any verbal modifi-ACRESDE  COLING-92  , NANTKS , 2328 Aotrr 1992188 PROC . OFCOLING-92, NANTES . AUG .  2328 , 1992er followed by ( the rest of the ) middle field or that it can be empty or that it can contain a nonfinite verb followed by an after field  . Finally , the after field is defined either as empty or as containing a verbal modi-fier followed by  ( the rest of the ) af-terfield . Some clarification of the general idea should be brought in by the structure  ( 12 ) for the sentence ( I i )  . Here , as well as in the struct-ures that follow , only the most spe-cific deducible sorts are given for a type  ( e . g . , with the const i tuent Hans the sort con~lement is used rather than the sort forefield  , because co~plement is more specific than for e -field  )  .

The previous example showed a relatively simple case where the number of elements  ( " fields " of the clause ) to be ordered was low and more or less given in advance  , and their ordering absolute ( e . g . , foref ie ld first , finite verb second , middle field third etc . ) . However , the descriptive power of the approach is not l imited to this : cases where the number of e lements is not given beforehand and their order ing is not absolute can be coped with  , too , as well as cases of word order combining the two kinds of requirements  . For more details see ( Oliva , 1992) . 
The principal achievement of the approach presented is the  ( re ) intro-duction of locality into binary branch ing structures allowing for replacing the more standard but in this case unsuitable concept of ordering constraints holding for sister constituents by a very similar concept of ordering constraints holding for a list of constituents  . However , the in-troduction of lists allows also for easiness of expressing different other techniques of describing word order arld its variations  , such as the " topological " approach discussed above  12 or the " systemic ordering " as worked out by Prague linguists  ( e . g . , Sgalletai . , 1986) etc . Worth consideration is also the relation of this approach based on typing of lists of surface constituents  ( expressing thus i . a . 
also their obliqueness hierarchy ) to the "<<"- type of LP-rules of the standard HPSG  , which , unlike the approach discussed , force obliqueness of complements to be expressed repeatedly within the subcategorizat i on list of each head  . 
The applicability of tile method of descript ion of word order as discussed in this paper has been proved by using it successfully in an experi-mental grammar of German developed in the STUF  '91 for laalism within the i ? Log project .

1In fact , free constituent order-but Is halls tick to the traditional terminology in this paper  . 
2 Though even the Engl ish word order is not that r igorous as is often assumed - especia l ly as to the posit ion of d i f ferent adjuncts  . 
3 This is not to say that this p rob lem is not latent also in the approaches presented by Uszkoreit and Gunji-they just use the clause-f in alposition of the verb in German and Japanese  ( i . e . , a phenomenon from the f ixed-word-order sphere ) which helps to cover it . 
4 Though in HPSG the formal d i f ference between the two is removed due to the existence of the featured trs  ( daughters )  , the intuitive difference of course remains . 
5 For this reason , the term syntact lolls t will be used later in this paper as an equivalent of the term binary branc ~ Ltng syntactic structure  . 
6 In the present paper , the term type is used for what is usually cal led also a feature structure  , an attribute-value matrix etc . The term sort will be used for kinds of feature structures  , i . e . for what is sometimes used to be called type ( of a feature structure )  . This convention will be used consequently and should not  , thus , causen~s understanding . Both types and sorts create their respective lattices  , in principle independent from each other . 
This allows for using operators & , v and not for creating unification , disjunction and complement , respectively , of types and sorts . In the following examples , types will be given as attribute-value matrices enclosed in square brackets  , and sorts as subscripts in italics of these brackets  . 
7 Reme~r that the pr inc ip le in the form of an implication applies only if the left-hand side of the implication unifies with the structure the principle should apply on  ; note also that in the particular case formulated here  , the HFP could have been simplified into a conjunction of a non-implication and an impl ication parts  . 
8 No form of HFP appl ies on the empty list no inheritance of features between mother and head daughter can occur there  , obviously . 
9Notwithstanding the particularization ( four implications instead of one in standard HPSG  )  , this still should be treated as a principle -it is a genera-lization holding across kinds of phrases  ( NP's , ir P's etc . ) . 
i0 Typically , but not necessarily , conca-tenation . 
iIT wo short remarks seem to be needed on this spot  . First , here the fact that in German the clause cannot be constituted by a finite verb alone  , is to be coped in other parts of the grantmar ( e . g . , by the subcategorization of the verb ) . Second , the fact that no after field is allowed in verb-last clauses in this example is an arbi trary decision  , having little to do with the general express ive power of the presented approach  , and even less with grammar of " real " German . 
1 2 Of particular importance on this spot seem to be the facts that on the approach sketched it is naturally possible to speak about  , e . g . , the middlef ie l d , giving to this term also a clear-cut formalized treatment bot without forcing it to occur as a true constituent in the description  , as well as the possibility to specify the position of the verb in verb-first and verb -second German clauses without re-torting to any kind of " movement " mechanism  ( e . g . , to SLASH ) .
