Abstract
This paper describes a system which automatically creates an abstract of a newspaper article by selecting important sentences of a given text  . To determine the importance of a sentence , several superficial features are considered , and weights for features are determined by multiple-regressionaalysis of a handprocessed corpus  . 
1 Introduction
The rapid expansion of the Internet enables us to easily access a lot of information sources in the world  . 
The ability to browse information quickly is therefore a very important feature of an information retrieval and navigation system  . Abstraction of a document is one useful tool for quick browsing of textual information  . 
Generally , an abstract can be considered to be a concise text giving an outline of the original text  . Creating an abstract requires deep semantic processing with broad knowledge  , and the strategy for generating an abstract depends on the type of target text  . Abstracts created by humans tend to differ according to their creators ' background knowledge and interests  . Furthermore , as stated in \[6\] , the same person is likely to create different abstracts of the same text at different times  . Simulating this human process is clearly outside the area that can be dealt with by current computational linguistics  . There are , however , some cases in which an abstract can be created by using surface clues to make conjectures as to which portions are the most important without using deep semantic processing  . 
The most practical way to create an abstract is thus to determine the most important portions by using surface clues  . There are two lines of research based on this approach : one analyze some aspects of a text's structure  , such as the rhetorical structure \[7\] , and selects some sentences according to this structure  \[5  ,  3\] ; the other analyze surface features for each sentence in a given text and selects the most important sentences according to some heuristics  \[6  ,  1 ,  9\] . In methods of former type , the rhetorical structure is appropriate for a relatively small set of sentences such as a paragraph  , but it does not give enough information to create an abstract for a large set of sentences  . In methods of the latter type , the validity of the heuristics is uncertain when the target text is changed  . Therefore , this paper proposes a method for selecting important sentences by using an equation based on surface features and their weights  , and a method for determining these weights by multiple-regressionaalysis of abstracts created by humans  . The target texts of this method are Japanese newspaper articles  . 
2 Surface Features of a Sentence
The proposed method is to create an abstract by determining important sentences according to features extracted from each sentence  . For each sentence in a given Japanese newspaper article  , the following features 1 are analyzed : ? Important Keywords : An important keyword is defined as a keyword that appears in another sentence or in a title  . The number of points for this feature is tile total number of occurrences of impot'tant keywords  . 
? Tense:
The tense of a sentence is analyzed as past or present  . This feature gives 1 point for present , and 0 for past . 
lb lest of these features were proposed in the previou studies  . 
Keywords were proposed in \[6\] , sentence location was proposed in \[1\] , sentence type was proposed in \[1 ,  9\] , etc . , and rhetori-ca \] relations were proposed in studies using rhetorical structures sud  , as\[a\] . 
974 ? Type of a Sentence:
Sentence types are fact , conjecture , or insistence . 
This feature gives 0 points for fact , 1 for conjecture , and 2 for insistence . 
? Rhetorical Relation :
The rhetorical relations to the preceding context is analyzed as example  , adverse , parallel , comparison , or connection . This feature gives 1 point for reason , 2 for example , and 0 for others . 
? Distance from the beginning of a text : In general  , sentences located near the beginning of a text tend to be important  . Therefore , sentences in the first paragraph are given 5 points for this feature , sentences in the next paragraph 4 , and so on . 
? Distance from the end of a text :
Sentences located near the ending of a text also tend to be important  . Therefore , sentences in the last paragraph are given 5 points for this feature , sentences in the previous paragraph 4 , and so on . 
The tense of a sentence is simply determined to be past if it has " ta "  ( an inflection for the past tense ) in the last phr~e3 The reason why tense is used is that sentences tating about the current fact seem to be more important hanones about the past fact in the context of editorial articles  . 
The sentence type is determined by checking special expressions in the last phrase  , a For instance , if the final phrase contains " be kida " ( " should " ) or " nake reba-naranai " ( " must " )  , then its sentence type is insistence ; if it contains " darou " (" probably . . . ") , then its type is conjecture ; otherwise , its type is fact . Examples of special expressions used to determine sentence type are as follows : ? Conjecture : kamosirenal  ( may )  , kanenai ( be capable of ) , souda ( likely to ) , youda ( likely to ) , darou ( probably ) , etc . 
? Insistence : tai ( want to do ) , hosii ( want someone to do ) , be kida ( should ) , nake reba-naranai ( must ) , taisetu-dearu ( important ) , hituyouda ( necessary ) , etc . 
2 In this method , past does not imply the past tense litastrict sense but rather  ; the sentence is not in the present tense . In Japanese , " ta " implies the past tense , completion , and so on . 
Most cases are actual instances of the past tense.
n it is sufficient to check in firelast phrase for Japanese sentences  , because a predicative phrase is always located at the end of a Japanese sentelt ce  . Therefore , another strategy is needed for languages in which a predicative phrase may be located in the middle of a sentence  . 
The rhetorical relation is determined by checking special expressions both in the first phrase and in the last phrase of a sentence  . For instance , if " sitakarada "4 is found in the last phrase , then the rhetorical relation is reason , and if the conjunction " sikasi " ( " but " ) is found , then the rhetorical relation is adverse .   5 Examples of special expressions used to determine rhetorical relations are listed below : ? Example : tatoeba  ( for instance )  , nado ( etc . ), etc . 
? Adverse : sikasi ( but ) , tokoroga ( however ) , etc . 
? Comparison : koreni-taisi ( while ), etc.
? Parallel : mata ( further) , sarani ( in addition ) , etc . 
? Reason : karada ( because ) , tameda ( because ) , etc . 
3 Process of Creat ing an Ab-s t rac t The basic method for creating an abstract in most previous tudies has been to analyze the sentences of a text in terms of some surface features  , and a heuristic to determine the most important sentences on the basis of these features  . 
The method proposed in this paper formalizes the above approach so that the importance of each sentence is calculated as the sum of feature points multiplied by their feature weights  . The most important sentences are then extracted as an abstract  . The importance S of a sentence is calculated as follows : r~i = t where a is a constant  , P/is the number of points assigned to the ith feature  , which is normalized to be between 0 and 1 , and W i is the weight assigned to the ith feature . 
The steps in creating an abstract are as follows :   1  . For each sentence , calculate the importance . 
2 . Selec the sentence that has the highest importance value among the unselected sentences  . 
3 . If the selected sentences l has another sentence s2 in the previous context hat is related to st by any rhetorical structure  , then s2 is also selected and marked . 
41 n English , this expression corresponds to " because " in the first phrase  . 
5These checking of sentence types and rhetorical relations are based on  \[10\]  . 
975 4 . If the ratio of the number of selected sentences to the number of sentences in the text exceeds the specified one  , then terminate this process ; otherwise , goto 2 . 
These steps select sentences on the basis of their importance value  , but they also respect the rhetorical structure to some extent  ( step 3 )  , because if the rhetorical structure is totally ignored  , the output text will be awkward to read . 
4 A Method for Determin ing the Weights of Features Most previous systems can be considered to determine the weights of features according to human intuition  . On the other hand , this paper proposes a method for determining the wieghts of features by multiple-regression analysis of correct examples  , which are abstracts created by testers . A tester selects important sentences that should be included in an abstract  . The importance value of a sentence is defined as the number of supporters  ( testers who selected it as an important one ) divided by the total number of testers . Let this importance value be S ; we then get the following equation for each sentence : 
S = a + LWI * Piiml where , a is a constant , Pi is the number of points assigned to the ith featnre which is normalized to be between  0 to l , and W i is the weight assigned to the ith feature . 
In this equation , Wi is the only variable . Therefore , the feature weight W i is calculated by multiple -regression analysis  . 
5 Experiment
We conducted an experiment to check the validity of the proposed method  . 
The testers were divided into two groups , A and B , each consisting 10 people . Those in group A selected important sentences ( about 1/3 of the article ) in 5 editorials and 3 general articles from the Nikkei Newspaper . Those in group B selected important sentences ( about 1/3 of the article ) in 3 editorials and 3 general articles , which were different from those used for group A . One of the editorials and one of the general articles

Table 1 shows two weight sets ; weight set 1 was created by the author in such a way that sentences located near the beginning and end are regarded as important  , sentence importance is not proportional to points for rhetorical relation  , and the importance of insistence-type sentences i higher in editorials than in general articles \] Weight set  2  , on the other hand , was calculated from the results obtained from group A by the method described in the previous section  . Weight set 2 for general articles implies that sentences near the beginning are more important hanones near the end  , and insistence-type sentences are less important , and so on . On the other hand , weight set 2 for editorial simplies that sentences both near the beginning and near the end are important  , and that insistence-type sentences are important , s To check the validity of these weight sets , we compared the abstracts created by the system , using weight set1 and 2 , from the articles supplied to group B , with 6This translation was made by the author , and is not authorized by Nikkei Newspaper K . K . 
7This weight set 1 corresponds to the way used in previous studies , where weights are determined according to human intuition  . 
8The weight set calculated in this method can be used as basic materiM for creating a practical system  , because it is difficul to ask enough people to do this experiment to ensure that the result is statistically meaningful  . However , the gener M tendency can be extracted , and the weight set is determined on the basis of this experiment  . 
976 the abstracts created by group B . For the general article in Figure 1(a ) , the three most important sentences ( roughly 1/3 of the article ) determined by using the weight sets 1 and 2 are listed in Figures 1   ( b ) and ( c )  , respectively . In this case , the three most important sentences selected by grout  ) B were 0 ,  2 , and 3 . Likewise , for the editorial in Figure 2(a ) , the eightmostiml ) ortant sentences ( roughly 1/a of the article ) determined by using weight sets lattd 2 are listed in Figures 2   ( b ) and ( c )  , respectively , in this case , the eightmost important sentences selected by grou I  ) 11 are 0 ,  2 ,  3 ,  12 ,  15 ,  20 ,  21 ,  22 . Here , we introduce the following metric of estrangement to check which abstract is most similar to the result of group B : E strangement = ~  . ,  , ( the number of supporters of a sentence si )  - ~_~ . </ ( the number of Sul ) porters of a sentence s j ) where s is a sentence that is included in an abstract by group B but not in an abstract created by the system  , and s . / is a sentence that is not included in an abstract by group B but is included in an abstract created by the system  . 
Theestrangements of the articles in Figures 1 and 2 are as follows : From this result , the weight set 2 calcu-
Weight Set 1 Weight Set 2 to adjust these heuristics for the given text . This paper proposed a method for this adjustment ; that is , a method for determining weights of surface features by multiple-regressionaalysis of abstracts created by human  . By using this method , a system can have an ability to be applied to a variety of texts  . 
7 Conclusion
This paper has proposed a method for creating an abstract by using surface features and their weights to select important sentences  , and a method for determining these \ [ eature weights by multiple-regression analysis of abstracts created by humans  . By using the proposed method to calculate feature weight  , this system can be applied to other types of texts  , and gives results n to resimilar to those of a human process than a set of weights based on human intuition  . 
This abstract creation system is currently used in an informatiol l navigation assistance system  \[8\] as a tool for quickly viewing the contents of newspaper articles  . 
References\[1\]\[2\]\[ , 3\] luted by multiple-regression a alysis is more similar to the human selection than the weight set  1 created according to the author's intuition . For the other general \[4\] articles used with group B , the estrangement values of weight set 2 are also better than those of weights et\[q 1  . In the other editorials , the estrangement values arc comparable . This implies that the weight set I is not such a bad estimate for editorials  . \[~\]6 Discussion\[71 Edmmtds on , lI .
