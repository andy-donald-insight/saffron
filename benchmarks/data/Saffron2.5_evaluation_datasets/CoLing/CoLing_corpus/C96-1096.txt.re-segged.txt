Abstract
The paper describes problems in dis-
ambiguating the morphological analysis
of Bantu languages by using Swahilias
a test language . The main factors of
ambiguity in this language group can
be traced to the noun class structure
on one hand and to the bidirectional
word-formation on the other . In analyzing word forms , the system applied utilizes SWATWOL , a morphological parsing program based on two -level formalism  . Disambiguation is carried out with the latest version  ( April 1996 ) of the
Constraint Grammar Parser ( GGP) . Statistics on ambiguity are provided . Solution st brresolving different types of ambiguity are presented and they are demonstrated by examples fi'om corpus text  . Finally , statistics on the performance of the disambiguator are presented  . 
Introduction
There are five principal factors in Bantu languages which contribute to ambiguous analysis of word-tbrms  . First , nouns are grouped into more than ten marked noun classes  . The marking of these classes extends across the noun phrase  , whereby the noun governs the choice of markers in dependent constituents  . Second , verbs inflect stem-initially and mark the subject  , object , and relative referent by prefixes , whereby the actual form of each prefix is governed by the noun class of the noun it refers to  . In addition , verb derivation also adds to the complexity of verbal morphology  . 
Third , reduplication is a productive phenomenon.
Because its accurate description in lexicon is not possible  , alternative ways in handling it are discussed . Fourth , the majority of Bantu languages have at one system  , but rarely this is indicated in writing . This adds to morphological mbiguity . 
Fifth , various semantic functions of wordforms are also a source of ambiguity  . 
In this paper I shall discuss the points one and two by using Swahili as a test language  . 
1 Morphological analysis
The morphological analysis of Swahili is carried out by SWATWOL  , which is based on the two-level formalism ( Koskenniemi 1983 )  . The application of this formalism to Swahili has been under process since  1987  , and it has now , after having been tested with a corpus of one million words  , reached a mature phase with a recall of 99 . 8% in average running text , and precision of close to 100% . The performance of SWAT-WOL corresponds to what is reported of ENGT-WOL  , the morphological parser of English ( Voutilainen et al 1992 ; Tapanainen and J/irvinen 1994) , and SWETWOL , the morphological analyzer of
Swedish ( Karlsson 1992).
SWATWOL uses a two-level rule system for describing morphophonological vriation  , as well as a lexicon with 288 sublexicons . Unlike in languages with right-branching word formation  , where word roots can be grouped together into a root lexicon  , here word roots have been divided into several sublexicons  . 
Because SWATWOL has been described in detail elsewhere  ( Hurskainen 1992 )  , only a sketchy description of its parts is given here  . 
1.1 SWATWOL rules
Two-level rules have been written mainly for handling morhophonological processes  , which occur principally in morpheme boundaries . Part of such processes take place also in verbal extensions  , whereby the quality of the stem vowel ( s ) defines the surface form of the suffix . The total number of rules is 18 , part of them being combined rules . 
An example of a combined rule : t_/:a : ; Chanqe lexical'U ' to surface'w'iff there is ' k ' on the lcft and a surface character belonging to the set ' Vo ' on the right  ; or there is ' t ' on the left and a lexical diacritic  '/1' on the right followed by a lexical'a' . 
1.2 SWATWOL lexicon
SWATWOL lexicon is at tree , where the morphemes of Swahili are located so that each route f ? om the root lexicon leads to a wellformed word-tbrm  . 
The most complicated part of the lexicon is the description of verb-forms  , which requires a total of : \[25 sublexicons . For describing verbs , there are a number of consecutive : prefix and suffix ' slots '  , which may or may not be filled by morphemes . 
The verb root is in the middle , and verbal extensions used mainly for derivation are suffixed to the root  . 
A noun is composed of a class prefix and root . Noun roots are located in 22 separate sublexicons , and access to them is permitted from the corresponding class prefix  ( es )  . Adjectives are grouped according to whether they t  , a keclass prefixes or not . Also numerals are grouped according to the same principle  . The lexicon has a total of about 27,000' words ' . 
Here is a simplified example of a sab-lexicon :
LEXICONM/MImUM/MIr"mU 3/4-SGN " ; miM/MIr"mU3/4-PLN " ; This is a sublexic on with the name'M/MI' containing prefixes of the noun classes  3 and 4  . Each entry may have three parts , but only the middle part is compulsory . In the first entry , ' mU ' is the lexical representation of a morpheme  , and ' M/MIr ' is the name of the sublexicon where the processing will continue  . The third part within quotes is the output string . 
In constructing the lexicon , underspecification of analysis was avoided . Although it may be used for decreasing the number of ambiguous readings  ( of . Karlsson 1992) , it leaves ambiguity within readings themselves in the form of underspecific a-*i on  , and it has to be resolved later in any case . 
2 Extent of morphological ambiguity 1 , ' or the purposes of writing and testing disarn -biguation rules  , a corpus of about 10 , 000 words of prose text was compiled ( Corpus 1) . The text Table 1: Number of readings of word-fbrms in Swahilitest corpus  ( Corpus 1 )  . N(r ) = number of readings , N(t ) = number of wordform tokens , % = percent of the total , cure -%= cumulative percentage
N(r)N(t)%cure-%1 46 53 48 . 74 48 . 74 2 2061 21 . 59 70 . 33 3 871 9 . 12 79 . 55 4 1047 10 . 97 90 . 52 5 542 5 . 68 96 . 20 6 162 1 . 70 97 . 90 7 49 0 . 51 98 . 41 8 22 0 . 23 98 . 64 9 34 0 . 36 99 . 00 10 33 0 . 35 99 . 351\] or more 72 0 . 75 100 . 00 was analyzed with SWATWOL , and the results in regard to ambiguity are given in Table  1  . 
As can be seen in Table 1 , about half of wordform tokens in Swahili areat least two ways ambiguous  . About one fifth of tokens are precisely two ways ambiguous  , and the share of three-ways and four-ways ambiguous tokens is almost equal  , about 10% . The share of five-ways ambiguous tokens is 5 . 68% , but the number of still more ambiguous tokens decreases drastically  . There are wordforms with more than 20 readings , tile largest number in the corpus being 60 readings . 
If we compare these numbers with those in Table 2 we note significant differences and similarities . Table 2 was constructed exactly in the same manner as Table  1  , only the source text being different . Whereas in Table 1a corpus of running text ( Corpus 1 ) was used , in Table 2 the source text was a list of unique word forms ( Corpus 2 )  . 
The number of wordforms with more than one reading is almost equal in both corpora  , slightly over 50% . The percentages in Table 2 decrease rather systematically the more readings a wordform has  . While there were more four-ways ambiguous wordforms  ( 10 . 97%) than three-ways ones (9 . 12%) in Table 1 , in Table 2 the numbers are as expected . The only unexpected result is the share of six -ways ambiguous words  ( 3 . 44%) , which is higher than the share of the five-ways ambiguous ones  ( 2 . 94%) . In Corpus2 , the high percentage of four-ways ambiguous readings found in Corpus  1 does not exist . 
The ambiguity rate in Swahili is somewhat lower than in Swedish  ( 60% , Berg 1978) . It seems to correspond to that of English ( Voutilainenctal 1992:5 )  , although Dett . ose ( 1988 ) gives somewhat Swahili list of unique word forms ( Corpus 2 )  . N(r ) = number of readings , N(t ) = number of wordform tokens , % = percent of the total , cum -%= cumulative percentage
N(r)N(t)%cure-%i 496048 . 13 48 . 13 2 2294 23 . 99 72 . 12 3 1031 10 . 78 82 . 90 4 568 5 . 94 88 . 84 5 281 2 . 94 91 . 78 6 329 3 . 44 95 . 22 7 102 1 . 07 96 . 29 8 88 0 . 92 97 . 21 9 85 0 . 89 98 . 10 10 34 0 . 36 98 . 4611 or more 1481 . 54 100 . 00 lower figures ,   11% for wordform types and 40% for wordform tokens . In Finnish the corresponding figures are still lower  ,  3 . 3% for wordform types and 11 . 2% for wordform tokens ( Niemiko-rpi 1979) . 
While the reported ambiguity counted from wordform tokens is generally much higher than that counted from wordform types  , in Swahili the difference is small . This is due to the fact that in addition to ambiguity found in several of the most common words  , verb-forms are typically ambiguous , as a real most half of the nouns . 
Karlsson ( 1994:23 ) suggests an inverse correlation between the number of unique wordforms and rate of ambiguity  . Therefore , heavily inflect-ing languages would tend to produce unambiguous word forms  . Swahili does not seem to fully support this hypothesis  , although the numbers in Table 1 and 2 are not directly comparable with results of other studies  . In Swahili lexicon , underspecification was avoided which adds to ambiguity  . 
3 Disambiguation with Constraint
Grammar Parser
Morphological disambiguation as well as syntactic mapping is carried out with Constraint Grammar Parser  ( CGP )  . Descriptions of its development phases are found in several publications  ( e . g . 
Karlsson 1 . 990; Karlsson 1994a , 1994b ; Karlsson et al 1994 ; Voutilainen et al 1992 ; Voutilainen and Tapanainen 1993 ; Tapanainen 1996) . It sets off from the idea that rather than trying to write rules by pointing out the conditions necessary for the acceptance of a reading in an ambiguous case  , it allows the writing of such rules that discard a certain reading as illegitimate  . The rule system is typically a combination of deletion and selection rules  . 
The morphological nalyzer SWATWOL was so designed that it would be ideal for further processing with CGP  . The output of SWATWOL contains such information as part-of-speech features  , features for adjectives , verbs , adverbs , nouns , numerals , and pronouns , as well as information on noun class marking ( also zero marking ) wherever it occurs , etc . In the present application also syntactic tags are included into the morphological lexicon as far as the marking can be done unambiguously  . 
The syntactic mapping of context-sensitive wordforms is left to the CGP  . 
In order to simplify disambiguatiOn , fixed phrases , idioms , multiword prepositions and non-ambiguous collocations are joined together already in the preprocessing phase of the text  ( e . g . 
mbeleya > mbele_ya ' in front of ') , and the same constructions are written into the lexicon with corresponding analysis  . 
3 . 1 Const ra in t Grammar ru le fo rmal i sm The subsequent discussion of the Constraint Grammar Parser is based on the formalism of Tapanainen  ( 1996 )  . A detailed description of an earlier version of CGP is in Karlsson  ( 1994b )  . The CGP rule file has the following sections ( optional ones in parentheses ) :
DELI MITERS ( PREFERRED-TARGET )   ( SETS )   ( MAPPINGS ) 


In DELIMITERS , those tags are listed which mark the boundary of context conditions  . If the rule system tries to remove all readings of a cohort  , the target listed in the section PREFERRED-TARGET is the one which survives  . SETS is a section where groups of tags are defined  . Syntactic parsing is carried out with rules located under the heading MAPPINGS  . CONSTRAINTS contains constraint rules with tile following schema :\[ WORDFORM\]OPERATION  ( target )  \[ ( context condition ( s )   ) \] WORDFORM can be any surface word form , for which a rule will be written . OPERATION may have two forms : REMOVE and SELECT . 
These are self-explanatory . In TARGET is defined the concrete morphological tag  ( or sequence of tags )  , to which the operation is applied . A target may be also a set , which is defined in the SETS is interpreted as a set  . CONTEXTCONDITIONS is an optional part , but in most cases necessary . 
In it , conditions for the application of tile rule are defined in detail  . Context conditions are defined in relation to the target reading  , which has the default position 0 . Positive integers refer to the number of words to the right  , and the negative ones to the left . In context conditions , reference can be made to any of the features or tags found in the unambiguous reading  , e . g . (1CADJ ), or in the whole cohort , e . g . (1ADJ ) . These references can be made either directly to a tag or indirectly through sets  , which are defined in a special section ( SETS ) of the rule formalism . 
Any context may also be negated by placing the keyword NOT to the beginning of the context clause  . It is also possible to refer to more than one context in the same position  . 
If there is a need to define further conditions for a reading found by scanning  ( by using position markers *-1 or *1 )  , the linking mechanismay be used . This can be done by adding the keyword LINK to the context  , whereafter the new context follows . For example , the context condition ( *-1NLINK 1 PP ~ ONLINK 1ADJ ) reads : ' there is a noun ( N ) on the left followed by pronoun ( PION ) followed by and adjective ( ADJ ) ' . 
3.2 Order of rules
The algorithm allows a sequential rule order . This can be done by grouping the rules into separate sections  . The sequential order of rules within a section does not guarantee that the rules are applied in the order where they appear  . The rules of the first section are applied first . Any number of consecutive sections can be used . There are presently four sections of constraint rules in the rule file  . Certain types of rules should be applied first , without giving a possibility to other , less clearly stated , rules to interfere . Typical of such first-level rules are those where disambiguation is done within a phrase structure  . In intermediate sections there are rules which use larger structures for disambiguation  . By first disambiguating noun phrases and genitive constructions  , the use of otherwise to opermissive rules becomes possible  , when clear cases are already disambiguated . 
The disambiguation fverb Jorms belongs to these middle levels  .   2?he risk of wrong interpretations decreases ubstantially by first disambiguating noun phrases and other smaller units  . 
The CGP of Swahili has presently a total of 656 rules in four different sections for disambiguation and  50 rules for syntactic mapping . So far about 600 hours have been used for writing and testing rnles  . 
4 Disambiguation of a sample sentence
Below is a Swahili sample sentence after morphological analysis and after CG disambiguation  . The sentence is : Washiriki waseminazote walitokakatikanchiza Afrika  . ( Participants of all seminars came from
African countries.

Rule S:816 removes an object reading of the wordform . After that , a selection rule S : 1099 is applied . 
SELECT(I/2-PLN ) ( iNCL-2+GEN-CON);
Select noun reading of N cl 1/2-PL if followed immediately by genitive connector belonging to the set  NCL-2  . This description is equal to the grammatical rule  . Also other rules follow the same principle . E . g . the reading 1/2-PL GEN-CON is chosen for the analysis of wa on the basis of the Ncl of the preceding noun  . The rule states : "< wa > " SELECT ( 1/2-eL )   ( - tNCL-2 )   ; Select Ncl 1/2-PL of the word ' wa ' if in the preceding cohort there is a feature belonging to the set 

Although both washiriki and wa are initially ambiguous  , and in rules the context reference does not extend beyond this pair of words  , we get the correct result . This is because in both of the cohorts there is only one such reading which refers to the same noun class  . 
The word semina is both SG and PL , and the following pronoun zote , which has the PL reading , solves the problem . The wordnch i is disambiguated with a rule relying on the Ncl of the following genitive connector  ( GEN-CON )  . 
The word katika has four readings . The grammatically correct way of disambiguating it is by referring to the following word  . 
"< katika > " SELECT ( PREPOS )   ( INORINF ORPRON ) Select the reading PREPOS of " katika " if there is a noun or infinitive of a verb or pronoun in the following cohort  . 
i 5 Success rate and remaining problems of di sambiguation The CGP of Swahili was tested with two text corpora  , which had not been used as test material in writing rules : E  . Kezilahabi's novel Mzingile (22 , 984 wordform tokens ) , and a collection of newspaper texts from the weekly paper Mzalendo  ,  1994 (49 , 969 wordform tokens ) . Test results are in Table 3 . 
Table 3: Ambiguity after processing with the Swahili CGP . N(t ) = number of wordform tokens , N(w ) = number of unique word forms , amb-(t ) = ambiguity in tokens , amb-(w ) = ambiguity in unique word forms . 
Ambiguity Mzingile Mzalendo
N(t ) 22,984 49,968
N(w ) 5,914 9,359 amb-(t ) 1,837 2,463% 7 . 99 4 . 93 amb-(w ) 72 18 31% 12 . 19 8 . 88 The parser performed best with newspaper texts , leaving ambiguity to 4 . 9% of tokens . Yet the overall result has to be considered promising  , given that the parser is still under development and that the rules are almost solely grammar -based  . 
The most common types of ambiguity still remaining are : noun vs  . adverb , adjective vs . adverb , noun vs . conjunction , verb ( imperative ) vs . 
noun , and verb ( infinitive ) vs . noun . Those are typically in such positions in a sentence that writing of reliable rules is difficult  . A fairly large part of remaining ambiguity concerns genitive connectors ya and wa  , and possessive pronouns . They are generally in positions where the governing noun is beyond the current clause or sentence boundary on the left  . For such cases , the rule syntax should tion . 
The vast majority of constraints are selection rules for resolving ambiguity based on homographic noun class agreement markers  , lit is possible to resolve most of this ambiguity by using contextual information  . 
Conclusion
The morphologic ManMys is of SwM filit ends to produce a comparatively large number of ambiguous readings  . The noun class structure coupled with class agreement marking independent constituents  , contribute significantly to ambiguity . 
The phenomenon is particularly evident in verb structures  , where different sets of noun class markers add to the ambiguity of the same verb form  . It is assumed that the solution suggested here apply 
M so to other Bantu languages.
The ambiguity resolution is based on the Constraint Grammar form Mism  , which allow stile use of grammatically motivated rules  . The maximal context in the present application is a sentence  , but there is a need for extending it over sentence boundaries  . ConstrMnt rules are grouped into sections , so thai ; the most obvious cases are disambiguated first . A parser wiLt ~ only grammar-based rules disambiguat csM  ) out 95% or Swahili word-tbrms from running text , which initiMly has about 50% of the tokens ambiguous . The remaining ambiguity is hard to resolve fully safely  , but probabilistic and hcnristic techniques are likely to still improve tile pert brmance  .
