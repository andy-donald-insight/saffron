This paper classifies distinctive phenomena occurring in Japanese spontaneous peech  , and proposes a grammar and processing techniques for handling them  . Parsers using a grammar for written sentences cannot deal with spontaneous speech because in spontaneou speech there are phenomena that do not occur in written sentences  . A grammar based on analysis of transcripts of dialogues was therefore developed  . It has two distinctive features : it uses short units as input units instead of using sentences in grammars for written sentences  , and it covers utterances including phrases peculiar to spontaneous speech  . Since the grammar is an augmentation of a grammar for written sentences  , it can also be used to analyze complex utterances  . Incorporating the grammar into the distributed natural anguage processing model described elsewher enables the handling of utterances including variety of phenomena peculiar to spontaneous speech  . 
1 INTRODUCTION
Most dialogue understanding studies have focused on the mental states  , plans , and intentions of the participants ( Cohen et al ,  1990) . These studies have presumed that utterances can be analyzed syntactically and semantically and that the representation of the speech acts performed by those ntterances can be obtained  . Spontane on sly spoken utterances differ considerably from written sentences  , however , so it is not possible to analyze them syntactically and semantically when using a grammar for written sentences  . 
Spontaneouspeech , a sequence of spontaneously spoken utterances , can be distinguished from well-planned utterances like radionews and movie dialogues  . Mncheffort has been put into incorporating grammatical information into speech mlderstanding  ( e . g . , Hayes et el .  (1986) , Young et al (1989) , Okada (1991)) , but because this work has focused on well-planned utterances  , pontaneously spoken utterances have received little attention  . This has partly been due to the lack of a grammar and processing technique that can be applied to spontaneous speech  . Consequently , to attain an understanding of dialogues it is necessary to develop a way to analyze spontaneous speech syntactically and semantically  . 
There are two approaches to developing this kind of analysis method : one is to develop a grammar and analysis method for spontaneous speech that do not depend on syntactic constraints as much as the conventional methods for written sentences do  ( Den ,  1993) , and the other is to augmen the grammar used for written sentences and modify the conventional analysis method to deal with spontaneouspeech  . 
The former method would fail , however , when new information is conveyed in the utterances  ; that is , when the semantic haracteristics of the dialogue topic are not known to the hearer  . In such cases , even illa dialogue , the syntactic constraints arensed for understanding utterances  . Because methods that disregard syntactic constraints would not work well in these kinds of cases  , we took the latter approach . 
We analyzed more than a hundred dialogue transcripts and classified the distinctive phenomena in spontaneous Japanese speech  . To handle those phenomena , we develop a computational model called L'n -semble Model  ( Shimazu et al , 1993b ) , in which syntactic , semantic , and pragmatic processing modules and modules that do combination of some or all of those processing analyze the input in i  ) arallel and independently . Even if some of the modules are unable to analyze the input  , the other modules still output their results . This mode \] can handle various kinds of irregular expressions  , such as case particle omission , inversions , and fragmentary expressions . 
We also developed Grass- . \] ( GT " ammar for spontaneou speech in Japanese) , which enables the syntactic and semantic processing modules of t ~ he Ensemble Model to deal with some of the phenomena peculiar to spontaneous speech  . Since G~'ass- . \] is an augmentation of a grammar used to analyze written sentences  ( Grat-J , Gr ' ammar for lexts in Japanese) , Crass-Y-based parsers can be used for syntactically complex utterances  . 
There are two distinctive features of ' G~'ass-J . One is that its focus is on the short units in spontaneous speech  , called utter ' auce units . An utterance uniL instead of a sentence as in Gral-J is used as a grammatical category and is taken as the start symbol  . A Grass-J-based parser takes an utterance unit as input and outputs the representation of the speech act  ( illoeutionary act ) performed by the unit . The other distinctive feature is a focus on expression speculiar to spontaneous speech  , and here we explain how to augment ( h'at-J so that it can handle them . Previous studies of spontaneous speech analysis have focused mainly on repairs and ellipses  ( Bearetel . , 1992; l , anger , 1990; Nakatani & Hirschberg , 1993; Otsuka ~; Okada ,  1992) , rather than expression speculiar to spontaneous speech  . 
This paper first describes Grat-J , and then classi-ties distinctive phenomena in Japanese spontaneous speech  . It then describes Grass-Y and present sev-eral analysis examples  .

' ( The hours we receive your requests , they are received 24 hours a day . ) 3 . 2 Treatment of the Phenomena by the
Ensemble Model
These kinds of phenomena can be handled by the Ensemble Model  . As described in Section 1 , the Ensemble Model has syntactic , semantic , and pragmatic processing modnles and modules that  ; do combination of some or all of those proeessings to analyze the input in parallel and independently  . Their output is unified , and even if some of the modules are unable to analyze the input  , the other modules output their own resnlts . This makes the Ensemble Model robust . 
Moreover , even if some of the modules arennable to analyze the input in realtime  , the others output their results in realtime . 
'\[' he Ensemble Model has been partially implemented  , and Ensemble/Trio-I consists of syntactic , semantic , and syntactic-semantic modules , it can handle ( p2 ) above as described in detail elsewhere ( Shimazu et al , 1993b ) . Phenomena ( p3 ) through ( p6 ) can be partly handled by another implementation of the Ensemble Model:  Ensemble/Quartet-1  , which has pragmatic processing modnle as well as the three modules of Ensemble /' lMo-I  . The pragmatic processing module uses plan and domain knowledge to handle not only well -structured sentences bntals oill-structured sentences  , uchas those including inversion and omission ( Kognre et al ,  1994) . 
To make the system more robust by enabling the syntactic and semantic processing modules to handle phenomena  ( pl ) and ( p3 ) through ( p6 )  , we incorporated Grass-g into those modnles . Grass-J differs fl : om Grat-J in two ways : Grass -J has lexieal entries for expression speculiar to spontaneous speech  , so that it can handle ( pl ) . And because sentence boundaries are not clear in spontaneous speech  , it use stile concept of utterance unit ( Shimazu et al , 1993a ) instead of sentence . This allows it to handle phenomena ( p3 ) through ( p6 )  . For example , an inverted sentence can be handled by decomposing it  , at the point where the inversion occurs , into two utterance units .

4 AGRAMMAR , FORSPONTANEOUS
SPEECH'\['hisection describesGrass-Z 4 . 1 Process ing Uni ts ' Sentence ' is used as the start symboling ranunars for written languages but sentence boundaries are not clear in spontaneous speech  .   ; Sentence ' therefore cannot be used as the start symbol in grammars l br spontaneous speech  . Many studies , though , have shown that utterances are composed of short units  ( I , evelt , 1989: pp .  23- . 24) , that need not be sentences in written language . Grass-3 uses such units instead of sentences . 
Consider , for example , Dialogue 1 in Fig .  4 . Utterances 1 and 3 cannot be regarded as sentences in written language  . Let us , however , consider ' hal ' in Utterance 2 . It expresses participant B's confirmation of the contents of Utterance  1  .   2 Each utterance in Dialogue 1 can thus be considered to be a speech act ( Shimazu et al , 1993a ) . These utterances are pro--cessing nulls we call " utlerance units  . They are used in Grass-J instead of the sentences used in Grat-J  . One feature of these units is that ' hal'can be  . intel\jected by the hearer at the end of the unit . 
The boundaries for these units can be determined by using pauses  , linguistic clues described in the next section , syntactic form , and so on . In using syntactic\[brm to determine utterance unit boundaries  , Crass-J first stipulates what an utterance unit actually is  . 
This stipulation is based on an investigation of dialogue transcripts  , and in the current version of Grass- . \] , the following syntactic on stituents are recognized as utterance units  .

4.2 Treatment of Expressions Peculiar to
Spontaneous Slme , eh
Classification
The underlined words in l ) ia k)gue1 in Fig . d do not normally appear in writLen sentences , We analyzed the dialogue transcripts to identify expressions that kequently appear in spoken sentences which includes spontaneous speech but that do not appear in written sentences  , and we cleLs sitied them as follows . 
1 . words plmnologically dif\[erentDora those in written sentences  ( words in parenthesis are corresponding written -sentence words  )   ( ex . )' shinakya'('shinakereb ? , if someone does not do ) , ' shich au'('shiteshimatf , have done ) 2 . fillers ( or hesitations such as well in l ! ; nglish ) ( ex . ) ' etto ', ' anoo'3 . particles peculiar to spoken langnage ( ex . ) ' tte','nante ',% oka'4 . interjectory particles ( words inserted interjecto-rily after noun phrases and adverbial/adnominal-form verb phrases  )   ( ex . ) ~ llel~Cdesllne~:sa ~5 . expressions introducing topics ( ex . ) ' ( ila ) ll de Sllke do ' , '(\ [ la ) idesuked on , ( , ' , ' ( na ) 12 desuga '6 . words appearing after main verb phrases ( these words takel ; he sentence-final form of verbs/auxiliary verbs /adjectives  )   ( ex . ) ' yo ' , ' ne ' , ' yone ' , ' keredo ' , ' kedo ' , ~ kere-domo ' , ' ga ' , ' kedomo ' , ' kate ' Nagata and Kogure ( 1990 ) addressed Jai ) an ese sentence-final expression speculiar to spoken JN  ) an ese sentences but ( lid not deal with all the spontaneous speech expressions listed above  . These . expressions may be analyzed morphologica . lly ( Takeshita & Fuknnaga , 1991) . Because some expression speculiar to spontaneous sl  ) eecb do not affect the propositiom dsions might be a way to process spontane on sspeech  . 
Such cascaded processing of morphological analysis and syntactic and semantic analysis disables the incremental processing required for realtime dialogue understanding  . Another approach is to treat these kinds of expressions as extra  , ' noisy ' words . Although this can be done by using a robust parsing technique  , such as the one developed by Mellish (1989) , it requires the sentence to be processed more than two times  , and is therefore not suitable for realtime dialogue understanding  . In Grass-J these expressions are handled in the same way as expressions appearing in written language  , so no special techniqm ~ . s are needed . 
Words phonologically different froin corresponding words in written-language The words ' tern'and'n desu'in'shitternn desu ka '   ( do you know that '? ) correspond semantically to ' teirn ' and ' nodes u ' in written sentences  . We investigated such words in the dialogue data ( Fig .  5) . One way to handle these words is to translate them into their corresponding written-language words  , but because this requires several steps it is not suitable for incremental dialogue processing  . We therefore regard these words as independent of their corresponding words in written-language  , ven though their lexical entries have the same content  . 
Fillers
Fillers such as ' anoo ' and ' et to ' , which roughly correspond to well in English , appear fl'equently in sporetaneou speech ( Arita et al ,  1993 ) and do not affect the propositional content of sentences in which they appear  4  . One way to handle them is to disregard them after morphological analysis is completed  . As noted above , however , such an approach is not suitable for dialogue processing  . We therefore treat them directly in parsing . 
In Grass-J , fillers modify the following words , whatever their grammatical categories are . The feature structure for fillers is as follows . 
head\[posinterjection \] sube at adjunct\[ lexical +\] adjacent nillexical  4-sem \[ restric\]The value of the feature lexica I is either + or -: it is + in lexical items and - in feature structures for phrases colnposed  , by phrase structure rules , of subphrases . Because these words do not affect propositional contents  , the value of the feature ( sere restric ) is empty . 
For exaln ple , let us look at the parse tree for ' et to 400-yen desu ' ( well , it's 400 yen ) . Symbols I(Interjec-tion ) , NP , and VP are abbreviations for the complex feature structures  . 
4 Although Sadanobu and ' TPakubo ( 1993 ) investigated the discourse management function of fillers  , we do not discuss it here . 
\[ . expressions related to aspect steku ( teiku in written-language )  , teru ( teiru ) , chau ( tesimau ) , etc . 
2 . expressions related to topic marker'wa'cha ( tewa )  , char ( tewa ) , ccha(te wa ) ,   . jr(dewa ), etc . 
3 . expressions related to conjnnetive particle'ha ' nakerya  ( nake reba )  , nakya ( nake reba ) , etc . 
4 . expressions related to formal nouns n(no ) , nmn(nmno ) , toko ( tokoro ) , etc . 
5 . demonstrative skocchi(kochira ) , korya ( korewa ) , so ( son ) , so shi-tara ( soushitara ) , sokka ( souka ) , socchi ( sochira ) , son(sono ) , sore . jr(sore de wa ), sorejaa ( sore de wa ), etc . 
6 . expressions related to interrogative pronoun nani nanka  ( nanika )  , nante ( nanito ) , etc . 
7. other mokkai ( mouikkai ), etc.

Particle speculiar to spoken language Words such as  2  ; te'in'KyototteOsakanot suginoeki desu yone '  ( Kyoto is the station next to Osaka , isn't it ? ) work in the same way a ~ sc~>e-marking/topic -marking particles  . Because they have no corresponding words in written language  , lexical entries for then , are required . '\[' hese words do not correspond to any specific surface case  , such as ' ga ' and %' .

Interjectory particles
In tmjectory particles , such ~% s'ne ' and ' desune ' , for low noun phrases and adverbial/adnominal-form verb phrases  , and they do \] lot affect tile meaning of tile utterances  . The intmjeciory particle'he'differs from the sentence-final particle'ne ' in the sense that the latter follows sentence-final form verb phrases  . These kinds of words can be treated by regarding them as particles Ibllowing noun phrases and verbs phrases  . 
The following is the feature structure for these words  .

Therefore , a noun phrase followed by an interjectory particle forms a  ( surface ) referring speech act in the same . way as noun phrase utterances , hH ; er . jectory particles add nothing to logical forms . For example , the speech act representation of ' genkou o desune'ix the  . same as (2) in Section 4 . l . 
Expressions introducing topics
As in Uttermtce 4 of l ) i alogne 1 , an expression such as ( , , a)r , des , ,k , ~do( , ,~o ) frequently apl , ears in dialogues , especially in the beginning . This expression introduces a new topic . Onewayt . oh and lean expression such as this is to break it  . down into na+n de su+kc do Fm . o . This process , however , prevents the system fronl detecting its role in topic intro-  ( luction . We therefore consider each of these expressions to be one word  . ' l ' he reason these expression are used is to make a topie explicit  , by introdncing a discourse referent (' Phomason ,  1990) . Consequently , an ' introduce-topic'speech act is formed . These ex-l ) ressions indicate the en ( I of an utterance unit as an interjectory particle .

'\[' he grammatical analysis of spontaneous speech is useful in combildng the fruits of dialogue undersl  , and ing research and those of speech processing research  . As describ (: dearlier , Grasso J is used as the grammar t br the experimental systems t ~  ; nsemble/rli'io-1 an cll'hmembleffQuartetq , which are based on the Ensemble Model . It enables the processing of several kinds of spontaneons speech  , such as that lacking particles .
