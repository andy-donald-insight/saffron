' File paper describes a tagging scheme designed for the Russian Treebank  , and presents tools used for corpus creation . 
1. lntrodudory Remarks
The present paper describes a project aimed at developing the first annotated corpus of P  , ussian texts . I . arge text coq ~ or a trove been used in the computational linguistics community long enough : at present  , over 20 large corpora for the main European languages arc available  , the largest of them containing hundreds of millions of words  ( I . anguage Resources (19971); Marcus , Santorini , and Marcinkiewicz (1993); Kurohashi , Nagao (1998)) . So far , however , no annotated corpora for Russian have been developed  . To the best of our knowledge , the present project is the first attempt to fill the gap  . 
l ) ifferent tasks require different annotation levels that entail different amount of additional information about text structure  . The corpus that is ; being created in the fiamework of the pre . sent project consists of several subcorpora that differ by the level of annotation  . The following three levels are envisaged : ? lemmalized leA'Is  , for every word , its normal form ( lemma ) and part of speech are indicated ; ? mowhologically tagged leXlS : for every word , a full set of nlorl ) hological attributes it specified along with the lenmm and the part of speech  ; ? symactically tagged ldxlx : apart from tile full morphological markup at the word level  , every sentence has a syntax structure . 
We annotate Russian texts with depml de , wy struct ttres-a formalism that is more suitable for Slavonic languages with their relatively fie e word order  . The structure not only contains in l'omlation on which words of the sentence are syntactically linked  , but also relegates each link to one of the several dozen syntactic types  ( at present , we use 78 syntactic relations ) . This formalism ensures a more complete and informative representation than ally other syntactically annotated corpus  . 
This is a major innowttion , since the majority of syntactically annotated corpora  , both those already awfilable and under construction  , represent he syntactic structure by means of constituents  . 
The closest analogue to our work is the Czech annotated corpus collected at Charles University in Prague-see Itajicova  , Panevova , Sgall (19981) . 
In this corpus , the syntactic data are also expressed in a dependency formalism  , although the set of syntactic functional relations is much smaller as it only has  23 relations In what follows , we describe the types of texts used to create the coqms  ( Section 2 )  , markup format ( Section 3) , annotation tools and procedures ( Sectional ) , and types of linguistic data included in the markup  ( Section 5 )  . 
2. Source text selection
The wellknown Uppsala University Corpus of contemporary Russian prose  , totalling ca . 
1 , 000 , 000 words , has been chosen as the prilnary source for our work  . The Uppsaht Corpus is well balanced between fiction and journalistic genre  , with a smaller percentage of scientific and popular science texts  . The Corpus includes samples of contemporary Russian prose  , as well as excerpts flom newspapers and magazines of recent decades  , and gives a representative coverage of examples are scarce and appear as dialogues inside fiction texts  . 
3. Markupfl Drnmt
The design principles were fommlated as follows : ?" layered " markup-several annotation levels coexist and can be extracted or processed independently  ; ? incrementality-it should be easy to add higher annotation levels  ; ? convenient parsing of the annotated text by means of standard software packages  . 
The most natural solution to meet this criteria is an XML-based markup language  . We have tried to make our format compatible with TEI  ( Text Encoding for Interchange , see TEI Guidelines (1994)) , in uoducing new elements or attributes only in situations where TEI markup does not provide adequate means to describe the text structure in the dependency grammar framework  . 
Listed below are types of iuformation about text structure tlmt must be encoded in the markup  , and relative tags/attributes ued to bear them . 
a ) Splitting of text into sentences . A special container element < S > ( available in TEI ) is used to delimit sentence boundaries . The element may have an ( optional ) ID attribute that supplies a unique identifier for the sentence within the text  ; this identifier may be used to store infommtion about extrasentential relations in the text  . It may also have a COMMENT attribute , used by linguists to store observations about particular syntactic phenomena encountered in the sentence  ; b ) Splitting of sentences into lexical items ~ . The words are delimited by a container element < W >  . Like sentences , words may have a unique " rD attribute that is used to reference the word within the sentence  ; c ) Ascribing morphological features to words . 
Morphological information is ascribed to the word by means of two attributes born by the < W > tag: 
LlgNNg_-a normalized wordform;
FEAT-morphological features.
d ) Storing information about the syntax structure . 
To annotate the information about syntactic dependencies  , we use two other attributes in the < W > element :
DON-the ID of the master word;
LINK-syntactic function label.
There are also special provisions in the lbrmalism to store auxiliary information  , e . g . multiple morphological nalyses and syntax trees . They are expected to disappear from the final version of the corpus  . 
4. Annotation tools and procedures
The procedure of corpus data acquisition is senti -automatic  . An initial version of markup is generated by a computer using a general ~ urpose morphological analyzer and syntax parser engine  ; after that , the results of the automatic processing are submitted to human postediting  . The analysis engine ( morphology and parsing ) is based upon the ETAP-3 machine translation engine-see
Apresjan et al (1992, 1993).
To suppor the creation of mmotated at a , a set of tools was designed and implemented . All tools are W in 32 applications written in C++ . The tools available are : ? a program for sentence boundaries markup  , called Chopper ; " a posteditor for building , editing and mana-ging syntactically annotated texts-Slruclure 
Edilor ( or SirEd).
The amount of manual work required to build annotations depends on the complexity of the input data  . Sir Ed offers different options for building structures  . Most sentences can be reliably processed without any human intervention  ; in this case , a linguist should look through the processing result and confirm it  . If the structure contains errors , the linguist can edit it using a user-friendly graphical interface  ( see screen shots below )  . If the errors are too many or no structure could be produced  , the linguist may use a special split-and-rtm mode  . This mode includes manual pre-chunking of the input phrase into pieces with a more transparent structure and applying the analyzer/parser to every chunk  . Then the linguist must manually link the subtrees produced for every chunk into a single structure  . 
If the linguist has encountered a very peculiar syntactic onstruction so that he/she is uncertain " doubtful " the whole sentence or sirlgh  . ' , words whoso func:tions are not complelely clear . The hiforniation will be stored hitheniarkt/p , and Sirlg d will visualize the rOS l~e C t i V e SClltellce  ; is one in need for further editing .

5. Types of linguistic information by level
MorpK0 Jg_gy information
The morphological analyzer ascribes features to every word  . The feature set for Russian includes : part of speech  , animateness , gender , number , case , degree of comparison , short form ( of adjectives and participles ) , representation ( of verbs ) , aspect , tense , person , voice . 
Syntax information
As we have already mentioned , the result of the parsing is a tree composed of links  . Links are binary and oriented ; they link single words rather than syntactic groups  . For every syntactic group , one word ( head ) is chosen to represent it as a slave in larger syntactic units  ; all other members of the group becomes laves of the head  . 
In a typical case , the number of nodes in the syntactic tree corresponds to the number of word tokens  . However , several exceptional situations occur in which the number of nodes may be less or even greater than the number of word tokens  . 
The latter case is especially interesting . We postulate such a description in the following cases : a  ) Copulative sentences in the present tense where the auxiliary verb can be omitted  . This is treated as a special " zero-form " of the copula  , e . g . On-uchitel'\[He is a teacher , lit . 
He-teacher \]? The copula should be introduced in the syntactic representation  . 
b ) Elliptical constructs ( omitted members of contrasted coordinative x pressions  )  , like in Jakupilru bashku , a on galstuk\[I bought a shirt , and he bought a neck tie , lit . I bought a shirt , and he a neck tie\] . 
The latter type of sentences should be discussed in more detail  . Elliptical constructions are known to be one of the toughest problems in the formalization of natural language syntax  . In our corpus , we decided to reconstruct he omitted elements in the syntactic trees  , tamking them with a special ' ? phantom " feature . In the above example , a phantom node is inserted into the sentence between the words on'he ' and galstuk'necktie  '  . This new node will have a lemma POKUPAT "\[ BUY \] and will be at " exactly the same morphological features as the wordform kupil\[bought\] physically present in the sentence  , plus a special " phantom " marker . In certain cases , the feature set for the phantom may differ from that of the prototype  , e . g . in a slightly modified phrase Jakupilru bashku , a on a galstuk\[I bought a shirt , and she ( bought ) a neck tie \] the phantom node will have the feminine gender  , as required by the agreement with the subject of the second clause  . 
Most real-life elliptical constructs can be represented in this way  . 
The inventory of syntactic relationship types generated by the  ETAP--3 system is wLs tenough : at present , we count 78 different syntactic function types . All relationships are divided into 6 adverbial , coordinative , auxiliary . 
For readers ' COl wenience , we will give equivalent
English examples :
A elant relalionships link the predicate word to its arguments  . Some examples (\[ IX\]-master , \[ Y\]-s lave ) : predicative-Pete\[Y\]reads\[X\] ; completive (1 , 2 , 3)-translate\[X\] the book\[Y , l-compl\]from\[Y1 , 2-compl\]English into\[Y2 ,   3-compl \] Russian Ah-ibutive relationships often link a noun to a modifier expressed by an adject ve  , another noun , a participle clause , etc : relative-The house\[X\]we live\[YI in . 
Quanlitalive relationships link a noun to a word with quantity semantics  , or two such words one to another : quantitative- five\[Y\]pages\[IX\]  ; auxiliary-quantitative-gtirly\[Y\]fiveIX \]  ; Adverbial relations hil ) slink the predicate word to various adverbial modifiers : adverbial-come\[Xli  , the evening \[ Y \] ; parenthetic-In my opinion IYI , lhal's\[IX\]righI . 
Coordinalive relationships serve for clauses coordinated by conjunctions : coordinative-buy apples \[ XI and pea Jwl Yl  ; coordinative-conjunctive-I ) tty apples and \[ X\]l ) emw\[Y\] . 
Auxiliary relationships typically link two elements that form a single syntactic unit : analytical-will\[IX\]buy\[Y\]  ; The list of syntactic relations is not closed . Tile process of data acquisition brings up a variety of rare syntactic constructions  , hardly covered by traditional grammars . In some cases , this has led to the introduction of new syntactic link types in order to reflect the semantic relation between single words and make tile syntactic structure unambiguous  . 
Conclusion
Corpus crcation is not yet complct cd:atprcs cnt , the flfll syntactic markup has been generated for  4  , 000 sentences (55 , 000 words ) , which constitutes 30% of the total amount planned . Our approach permits to include all information expressed by morphological and syntactic means in contemporary Russian  . We expect that the new corpus will stimulate a broad range of further investigations  , both theoretical and applied . 
We plan to make the corpus awtilable via EI , RA fiamework after completion . Samples of tagged text , documentation and structure editing tools will be available for download from our site : If ltp:/ /prolin~  . iitp . ru/Corpus/preview . zip .
