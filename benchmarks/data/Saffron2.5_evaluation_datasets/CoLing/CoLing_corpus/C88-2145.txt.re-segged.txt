Elaborating one of the points of his Coling ~ on n 1986 paper , the author discusses prononfn~lity , which is due to a special semantic stratum , singula-tire identifieational deixis . Personal , reflexive and interrogative pronouns have additional trans-n\[issional deictic markings  , but singulative identi-ficational pronominality alone has a direct anaphorie effect and tends to reinforce syntactically  . This , explains , for instance , German sich selbs t . 
i . In several publications of mine/van Schoo -ncveld  1982/  , /idem forthcoming - A/ , /idemforth-c~ning-C/\]i have had occasion to mention in passing the specia \] nature of pronouns  . Pronouns have their own type of deixis . 
2 . Deixis is traditionally used for the type of meaning which results from the once-occurring speech act  , Sauss ~ e's parole , being recodified , that is , being incorporated back into the langue . In adverbs lJJ < e h ere\[~nd now the code refers to actual applications o--o-f--J ? self-?-We cannot identify the referent of here and now without taking recourse to our having T~-~tifie~- ~ he given speech act  .   11~e speech act becomes a part of the narrated situation/Bru~nann  1904/  , /Lyons 1977 , pp . 638 sq q . / . 
3 . It is an empirical fact , however , that language can also indicate an identific at ionact which takes place during the narrated situation  . Thus we have to do in the preposition out with a space which l~s been identified  ( an in-spa ~ and subsequent \] . y discarded as irrelevant ~ the next identification  , so that " out " is the resulting meaning . What isira-portent he ~ . is that all identifications , subsequent ones as well as the first , may take place in the ~ m~ated situation , not necessarily during the speech ( the transmission ) act . 
Do we have to do with deixis in the case of identification in the narrated situation ? l ~% at depends on how we use the word deixis  . If we understand by deixis the reincorporation of an identification  , act into the code , that is , the prerogation , by the first identifier , of the identification of the referent , then we can speak of deix is also in the second case ~ when the entire identification procedure takes place Jn then arrated situation alone  . But that is not the way the term deixis has been used tradit Jo ~\[\]  . lyby linguists . In the traditional con-ceptualiza'i:ion , deixis is of a tranmnissional nature . 
If ~ however , we are . to use the term deixis for any recodJfication of the initial identification of the refer  ( u ~ t , including identifiuation in the narra-ted situation  , " then we must distinguish between mere identificational deixis  ( in the narrated situation )  , and the traditional type of deixis , which I call tran~nissional deixis . In pronouns we have to do with a deixis of the identificational variety  . 
4 . Of both types of deixis , transmissional and identificational ~ there exist two varieties : m\]uT mh ~ rked type and a singulative tqfpe/van Schoone-veld forth  ; oming - A/ . In the singulative type ~ all identifications take place at the same moment  . Pronominal deixis is singulatively identificational  . 
Singultative transmissional delx is gives rise to references to the process of the transmission  , that is , the pzx~ess of pronunciation itself . It regulates ~ for i\[~stance , the relation between grammatical morphemes ( endings ) and lexical morphemes . In singu-lative identification alde ix is all identifications in the narrated situation must take place simultaneously with the first one  . 
5 . It is obvious that singulative ~ ansn\[issional deixis is the type of deixis which is at the basis of demonstrative pronouns  . In " the framework of the de-mons ? ~ ative pronouns our vantage point is that of an identifier operating within the narrated situation  ; in the personal pronom~s the speech si'ttm tion is involved at the same time  . 
In the personal pronom % s , we have to do with a semm ~ tie mechanism more complex than that of the demonstrative pronouns  . The personal pronouns setup objects as being on a par with speaker and receiver  , since they define these objects ( referents ) further in terms of the speech situation . In using the first person the speaker looks at his own image in then fir-ror of the singulative r ~ r rated situation  . Mutatismut and is " the same happens in the second and third person  . 
8 . Pronouns in general aren ~ rked by singulative identificational plurality  ( plur "' )  . Singulative identificational plurality means that there is multiple synchronized identifiability of the referent  . Asingu\]ative ( mini- ) narrated situation is created . The referent of the demonstrative pronoun ' that ' equals a  ( mini- ) narrated situation . 
Personal pronouns are , being pronouns , marked by plur "' , but a further specification ( subclassification ) is done by transmissional semantic teahines . 
7 . At this point , I should mention t\]~t I have empirically concluded that Russian semantic values can be expressed in terms of six Semantic features which occur on each of the four deictic levels mentioned  ; i . ~ . , by 24 semantic features . These features constitute an ordered set in that each succeeding tea time incorporates the information given by its predecessor/van Schooneveld  1983/  , /idem forthcoming-C/ . 
.P!urality , the first feat\[~e , instructs the recel vertoper form more tl~nnone identification on one object or to identify more than one object  . 
DimensJ ~ nality singles out from a plurality of identi-fications a subset which is distinct from its peers  . 
Preidentity indicates that the first identification must be assumed to have been performed earlier than other identifications in the narrated or speech situation  . Extension reidentifies an identified element and impl ~ elative unaffectedness by the identification situation  ; cancellation signalizes the complement of an originally identified set  , and objec~tiveness indicates that the referent can be at any frcm the element initially identified  . 
? II ! 8 . The third person is , add it lonally to plur , marked by transmissional plurality ( plu ~") . In the pronouns , plur " creates a reference in the speech situation which must not necessarily be identified with the speaker or the receiver but can be repeatedly  ( i . e . a multiple of times ) identified . 
The second ' person is , additionally to plur "' , n~rked by ( non-singul~tive ) transmission S , dimensionality ( dim ") . Dim " says that there is a subset of elements in the speech situation which have a property in common  . What else constitutes a more conspicuous subset of actants in the speech situation than those who actively participate in it ? The second person indicates the direct participant in the speech situa-The first person is  , in addition to plur "' , marked by ( non-singulative ) transmissional preiden-tity ( preid " )  . The identity of the referent ( the speaker or the central actant in the speech situation  ) has been established befome h and by an a et ant ( participant ) in the speech situation : the speaker himself . 
The next feature in the hierarchy of semantic features is extension  . Extension signifies that the referent has already been identified and hence is minimally independently characterized by this  ( repeat ) identification . It is obvious that the reflexive pronoun is nothing else but the variety of personal pronoun that is marked by  ( non-singula-tive ) ? ~ ansmissional extension ( ext " )  . Its referent has already made an appearance in the speech situation  . 
Is there a personal pronoun marked by ( non-singulative ) tr~s missional cancellation ? It would signify an object which in the speech situation would not be immediately identifiable  . It is evident that the indefinite/interrogative pronounk to ' who ' ~ to ' what ' is the personal pronou/~markedb--y--cane "  . 
- - 9 . SJ~gulative identifieational ( plur "' ) means a multiple synchronized identifiability which is valid only during the synchronized identi-fications  . The demonstrative pronoun that is marked by plur "'   . One of its eombinatory varl ~-~ n-~s is anaphora . As Lyon shase on cluded ~ anaphora is but a eombinatory variant of the ostensive signification of pronominality/Lyons  1977  , pp . 657 sq q . / . Anaphora is per definition em contextually conditioned  . 
Pronominal dimensional it\[ ( singulative identifi-cation ald J ~ ensionality \ [ dim "  '3  ) will mean that the anaphor is seen as distinct frcmits background  . One might say the full extend of the referent up to its outlines becomes crucial  . The pronominal adjective all conveys this meaning . 
--Pronominal preid entity will mean that with regard to a given narrated situation and its components the referent will be once-oe curingly unexpected  ; evidently it is the pronominal adjective other that carries singulative identificational  prei~6~-~ty   ( preid "' )  . 
Singulative identificational extension ( ext "' ) will mean that the referent has a lr~n identified and is  , in synchronization with this original identification  , reidentifiable an indefinite number of times . The referent is indefinitely reidentifi-able . The pronominal self ( Russian sam\[longforms ~--~ S'Germanselbst ) ~- i ~ marked by e "' . 
ingulative i --- l"-~6-nt if teat to nal cancellation ( cane "' ) will mean that at a moment precedingaonce -occurring nax~ative situation  , there has been an identification of a referent but this referent is in the time period synchronized with this identification no longer available for identification  . In English , the pronominal which , Russian ~ , indicating the identifier ' ~ a pability of identifying the referent directly  , is used either in appeals for elucidation ( that is , in questions , as an interrogative pronoun ) , or anaphorically , that is , as a relative pronoun . In German ~ thee or responding welch can in addition be used as an indefinite pronoun  . ~ which and Welch Work off then axe~ted situation  , w~s the pe~nal ) interrogative/indefinite pronouns kto/~to , which/what and wer/was work off the speech Situatl-~0-n  . 
bb-~tiven e--s~~-dicates a referent which is identifiable at random  . In the pronominal category ~ the pronoun any is marked by obj "'  . 
i0 . In conclusion , a few words on the interre-lation between semantic structure and syntax  . 
The interrogative pronominal ~ , whieh ~ welch ( marking : can e "" ) that is a contextuavv ~ iant of the relative pronoun refers to an already identified narrated situation  , as it should do given the general properties of the ea ne ellation feature  . This pronominal is essentially coreferential . Thus Russian ko tor ~' which ' means ' which member  ( s ) of an already ~ venset ' and ~ hglish which itself also implies membership in a set a lead-~-i ~ entified  ; the claim of some granmars That which implies a choice between two items is obviously based on the most frequent Jnstantiation of its interrogative usage  . 
German welch used as indefinite pronoun also is core-ferentia - ~  . In Ich babeke in Geld . Has du welches ?' I have no money . Do you have some ?' welches can refer only to money ~ whereas w ~_~ s ' what m -- Cr s--ome thing '  ) is inappropriate . In contrast to the singulatively identificational pronominals discussed in section  9  , personal pronouns ( see under 8 ) are not coreferential . 
For instance , in Russian , the specifically interrogative ( personal ) pronouns k to ' who ' and ~ to ' what ' ( plur "'+ cane " ) are not c--6~eferential e-x~ept in a few explainable cases ( e . g . vsekto ' all who ') . 
Coreferentiality also occurs mn the ( singula-tively identificational ) pronominal expression marked by ext "' , in Russian the short foz ~ n adjective sam , long ( adjectival ) forms ~ f ~ in English self ~- d in Germans elbst . The Russ--lan--reflexive(p~-o~ml ) pronouns - ~ , latins e , German sie his merely the personal-~-noun mark ~ by plu ~" ~-- i--ext ''  ( see above under 8 )  . It is the pronoun with minimal referenti-ality and hence maximal coreferentiality  , seen direct- . 
ly from the speech situation as orientation point.
The reflexive ( personal ) pronoun reminds the audience of the existence of a person in an exclusive narrated situation  ( plur "' ) and says that this referent is no-thing new in the speech situation -- it is not a person mentioned for the first time  . The reflexive pronominal adjective discussed in 9: Russian sam , English self , latini_2 s_e , G ~ rmanselbst  ~ on the other hand , whle~h--is marked by singulatlvel d~---- ~ entificational extension  ( ext "' )  , does not create the illusion of an individual , but merely signalizes the quality of introvertivity  . It signalizes coreferentiality limi-ting its range of reference strictly to stay within the confines of the given narrated situation  . Obviously the referent of the reflexive pronoun is the likely carrier of this introvertivity  . Thus arise in various languages expressions which are emphatic parallels to the reflexive pronoun : Russian ~ German siehs elbst  . Singulative identifiea-tlonal deixis ~ ~ econd layer of anaphora  . 
Incidentally , singulative identification alde ix is can be shown also to provide the struetural basis of the system of number words ~ like two  , three and so on ~ which are , again , typically ~- ~ ho~/van Schoone-veld for % hccming -B/  . 
The conclusion suggests itself that for a description of syntactic relations involving pronouns singulatively identifieational features are a crucial and effective tool  .
