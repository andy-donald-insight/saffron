The paper presents a procedure for interpretation of English compounds and lkn " automatic translation of such compounds into Slavic languages and French  . Intile target languages , a compound nominal is as a role to be rendered by an NP with an adjective or genitive attribute  , or with an attrilmtive participle construction . The model is based on Bierwisch's theory of word formation  , which in turn is inspired by categorial grammar . The procedure is applied to a specific domain ( asthmare search )  . 
0. INTItOI ) UCTION
The need of a component interpreting complex lexical items in an MT system translating fl'om Germanic languages in to e  . g . 
French or Slavic languages is obvious . Many rules ( or patterns ) of word fo , ' mation are highly productive , which makes it impossible to store all complex lexical entries in a static lexicon  . 
An effective MT system rnust also be able to match the interpretation facomplex entry with the correct morphosyntactic pattern in the target language  . For example , a program translating from German into Polish must distinguish the relations between the parts of a compound like Universitiits lehrer  ( university teacher ) \[' rotll the relations holding between Musik and Lehrer in Musiklehrer  ( teacherel+music )  . The first mentioned compound is to be translated as a noun followed by an adjective  ( nattcielt miwer sy-tecki-'teacher university + adjective ending '  )  , the later one its a noun and a genitive attribute  (  , za-ttczycielmttzyki-'teacher music+gen') . Similar problems occur when translating into French or Czech : cf  . Musikabend-Fr . so im ; emtt . s'icah'(na ), Cz . hudebn(ve & ~ r(an ), Mttsiklehrer-Fr . 
pro . fiesseur de musique ( nprepn ), Cz . tlEite lhudbv(nn+gen ) . 
Tile models for compound interpretation ad generation proposed by generalinguists  ( of . 
Lees 1960, Selkirk 1982, Fanselow 1988,
Bierwisch 1989 ) require as a rule several modifications in order to be applicable illan MT system  . Since , in our opinion , a model aimed to serve as an efficient tool for NLP and MT mnst be linguistically valid  , we will discuss a number of theoretical questions and relate our model to generalinguistics beRn'e presenting our experimental procedure t'or domain -restricted compound translation  . 
1. Till ,; STATUSOFWORI ) FOR MATION
RUIA ,; S 1.1.' Where ' s nmr phology ?'
The above question , put by Stephen
Anderson 1982 , is still waiting for a definitive answer . Word for , nation rules have been claimed to obey syntactic principles and hence being a part of UG  ( Lees 1960 , Pesetsky 1985) , to form a grammatical level on their own ( DiSciullo & Williams 1987 )  , to be explainable in semantic terms solely ( Fanselow 1988 ) or to belong to the lexicon ( Chomsky 1970 , Jacken-doff 1975 , Bierwisch 1989) . 
We will propose a quite simple answer to Anderson 's question : morphology shall be seen  ; is a component of the grammar , timnotion ' grammar ' to be understood as an integrated f node l where no borders are drawn between syntax  , morphology , and semantics . 
1 . 2 . Towards an integration of syntax , semantics and morphology Fanselow (1985 , 1988) argues , on tile basis of psycholinguistic evidence , for treating word for nmtion rules not ; is generative processes , but as a ' primitive ' process of co , a catcnating mor-phematic items , a very easily learnable procedure . His argumentation is restricted to morphology in the traditional sense of timter m  . We would like to go even further and clailn that tile graln mal " as a whole can be regarded as a set of patterns ' of concalol Vd tion or COOCllITell Ceof lexical items  , each concatenatio , ~ pattern associated with principles of semantic interpretation  . 
This approach is to some extent inspired by ( but farl ' ronlidentical to ) categorial grammar and gier wisch's lexicon theory  ( P , ier wisch 1989) . 
Attile same time , it is in its very essence not incompatible with Constraint Grannnar  ( Karls-son 1990 , Koskenniemi 1990) . 
1.3. Compounds as collocations
English compounds provide an argument in \[' avour of our approach to grammar  . It seems impossible to draw a clearcut borderline between strings traditionally labelled its  4  , 5 compounds and those classified as noun phrases . Cf . : the following examples , taken from a corpus of medical abstracks : ragweed aller gicd fnit is house-thtst-allergica  , vthmahouse chts tasthma patient daily symptom diary cards fluticas one propion atea queous nasal sprayIn most grammatical descriptions  , strings consisting of nouns ( like house dustasthma ) are treated as compound nouns , whereas a complex including an adjective followed by a ' noun is normally labelled as an NP  . The above examples show , however , that such a distinction is not unproblcmatic . Phrases like house-dust-allergicast hma and . flutic as one propion atea queous nasals pray may be analysed either as NPs containing a compound adjective and a head noun  , or as compounds including optional adjective constituents  ( hottsedustasthm and fluticas one , wray are perfectly wellformed ) . Furthermore , parts of an English compound may provide referents for elliptic constructions  , as in the following examples : The variations in provocation concentrations  . . . 
were small during both place boamlactive drug treatment the d~fference between a single al lergen provocation and continltotts exposure  . . . 
Thus , a noun included in a compound can still have a referent on its own  , an ability normally associated with nominal phrases  . Such facts indicate that there is no absolute distinction to be drawn between compound nominals and complex nominal phrases in English  . It seems more appropriate ot alk about morn or less lexicalized collocations  . However , in the following the traditional term ' compound ' will be used  . 
2. AUTOMATICINTIql PilETATION AND
TRANS LATION OF COMPOUN i)S 2 . 1 . The theoretical foundation
Bierwisch (1989 ; cf also Olsen 1991 ) regards the process of compounding as a functional application  , where one of the thematic roles of the head noun becomes ' absorbed '  . For example , a noun like payer is supposed to have the following interp  , ' etation :) ~ y ) ~ x\[zINST\[xPAYy\]\] , where y is the external the ta-role , x the internal one , madz represent she ' referential role ' . In a compound like bill payer , the internal role of pay becomes instantiated : ) vx\[zINST\[xPAYBILL\]\] . 
Our analysis of compounds is not incompatible with Bierwisch's approach  . 
However , for the purpose of MT , a classification of valency in terms of three kinds of the ta roles only  ( external , internal and referential ) seems insufficient . A procedure for compound interpretation must also take into account optional thematic roles  , e . g . location ( tmive ~ wio , teacher ) . It must in addition be able to deal with compounds that do not include deverbal components  . IIence , we decided to modify the theory proposed by Bierwisch at two main points : a  . the valency of a verbal stem is to be represented not in terms of external and internal them roles  , but in terms of the components of the event or situation the verb may refer to b  . the interpretation of compounds that do not contain deverbal elements is based on morphosemantic pattern specifying the default readings of combinations that include members of dilTferent semantic ategories  . 
2 . 2 An experimental procedure for understanding derived nouns and compounds In an experimental program  , implemented in LPA MacProlog , we structured a very restricted lexicon of Swedish stems and affixes  ( basal lexicalent , ' ies , BI . A ) according to the approach outlined above . Each verbal stem was provided with a list of elements of its typical event referent  , e . g . : lex(\[l~ir\] , m(teach , stem) , v , vt , \[ agent , sem_object , domain , place , time , resultl , \[\]) . 
Affixes were specified with respect othe following features :  0 the category or categories of stems the affix may be combined with  0 the resulting category , including the morphosyntactic specification 0 the default semantic interpretation f the affix . 
For example , the Swedishag cntive suffix-are was represented as : slex  ( \[ arel , suff(n , agr(sg , re , indef )) , v , agent , \[\]) . 
Underived nouns got a quite simplified semantic specif cation formulated in tradilional terms like ' human '  , ' animate ' , ' abstract ' , concrete ' , ' potential location ' etc . On this basis , the inter-prctation procedure tried to match the semantic specification of the affix or of the noun and associate the morphcmaii centries attached to the verb stem with the most probable lements of tinguished correctly between coml + ounds like grammatik liimre  ( teacher of gl ' it lllllal ' ) and to li-vetwite tslih ' are ( university teacher )  , as shown in the following outprint . 
:- analym (\ [ grammatikl; , iraml)m ( I domain ( grammar) , head(m(I agent ( suff ) , head ( teach ) l ) category : nagr(sg , re , indel +) constituents\[grammatik ,  1; , i rate , \[\] fir , : tretl:-analyse(\[universitetsl; , irarel ) m(\[place(university ) , head(m(\[agent(suff ) , head(teach)\])) l ) category:nagr(sg , re , indef ) constituents\[universit et , l?i rare , II ~ ir , a toll The program wits also able to interpret somewhat unusual  , but I ' ully possil+le compounds like ttniversiter vmi  ) rd are ( university killer )  . In the case of ' university killer ' , three alternative interpretations were given , all of them acceptable in Swedish : l ) a person who kills in university buildings ,  2 ) somebody who causes destruction of a university ,  3 ) somehody who uses a university for destructive purposes  . 
The flexibility of the quite simple interpretation procedure and its a hility to ' und crst:md'even unusual complex words encouraged us to apply the method tested by means  ol7 the toy program fflra more serious goal , viz . for interpretation and translation of rncdical abstracts dealing with a sthm and allergy research  . 
2 . 3 . Translation o1" compounds within ; l restricted domain ( medical texts mlast hma and allergy research )  2 . 3 . 1 . Domain-related requirements In order to construct a domain specific lexicon and to design apl  ) ropriate parsing and translation algorithms , we investigated a corpus of about 140 medical abstracts . Already the preliminary inspecticm provided evidence for the need of a special procedure for CO ml mund interpretation  . The frequency of compounds in the texts was extremely high  . Cf . the following sample : A largescale mttlticenter investigation was undertaken in  3 cities with c'Oml ) aral . ~le pollen seasons and atmospheric pollen concentrations in order to obtain + more dell ' nile  it~flormatiot7 about the sa/'et y and + q\[icacyo\['cromolyn so dium in the treatment of pollen-induced seasonal rhinit is  . 
Complex names of chemical substances , as cromoly t ~ soditm , , do not pose especially great prohlems to an MT system  , since chemical symbols may be efficiently used as interlingual representations  . Highly lexicalized and highly idiosyncratic ompout v  , ls , like air ways or hayfi , ver , may also hestored in timbasic lexicon . 
The rnain difficulty lies rather in the translation of productive compounds referring to different allergics yu drom s  , types of medical treatment and patient groups ( ragweed pollen as thma , late-stmt merrhinilis , Jhm isolide test ,  . lhm is ol Me patient group etc . ) . In different exts , tile same syndrom may be referred to by different phrases  , e . g . ragweed as thma , ragwood-in-dttcedasth nla , ra , ~woodpollenasttuna , rag-wood-allergi casthma etc . A correct interpretation of the semantic relations between tile constituents of such collocations is necessary for correct translation  . Otherwise , a phrase like child / ~ oodo . vthma\vcm hlbe translated into French it ot ot its asthmede set frmts  , btt tas ? tsthmeincht it parel!/?race(lit . asthmain duced by child-hood-by analogy to e . g . pyrethrltma-ctslhmeinduit\]mr\]~yr + ; thrines ) . A procedure for interpretation of compounds and complex NPs must therefore include a kindol ' domain know+lc?lge  , preferably encoded in the lexicon . 
2.3.2. The lexicon
An MT system aimed at translatkm of scientific texts should give tile user a possibility el " adding new entries to the lexicon in a simple way  . A system for medical abstract translation would n ~t be really useful  , if the user could not introduce names of new medicines  , new terms denoting syndroms , symptoms , treatment me- . 
thods etc . Since the users of such a . system would , with a high degree of probability , be a nonlinguist , the linguist designing the method for lexicon extension lntl stadapt the form of interactions to the expected competence of the 
I . iser.
It would be naive to helive that a nonlinguist could manage to specify tile lexical items in terms of internal and external the ta~roles  . Even terms like agent , theme and semantic object would prohably cause confusion  , l-lence , it seems most reasonable to fornmlate these , nan-tic classification i do , nain-spccific texts ( in our case , in terms like allergen , syndrom , body part etc . ) . There are actually linguistic reasons for this solutiot l  , as scientific sublanguages differ semantically from each other as well as from the everyday conversation language  . For a botanist , pyrethrum is primarily + a plant belonging to the chrysant hemum family  , whereas an allergy re-ing factor , having much in common with grass pollen and house dust  . 
In the preliminary model of the lexicon developed until now we classify nouns as members of the following categories :- syndrom  ( asthma , rhinitis ) - symptom(sneezing , irritation )- allergen(pyrethrum , ragweed )- body part ( air ways , skin ) -body function ( inhalation ) -chemical substance : medicine ( antihistamine ) or not used as medicine ( histamine ) -medical treatment ( injection ) -scientific method ( measurement , test)-time period ( season , childhood ) -lmman : patient or not ( the later distinction is needed for con'ect interpretation f e  . g . 
asthma patient and a sthma researcher ) -amount : mass or countable ( dose , group ) - others : concrete or abstract 2 . 3  . 3  . Interactive lexicon extension Tim user hastim possibility to classify new nouns to be added to the lexicon by marking the desired alternative in an interaction window  . 
The same entry may be marked as belonging to several categories  . For example , inhalation may be regarded as both body function and medical treatment  ( house dustinhalation ~ steroid in ha-lation )  . When adding a compound , the user is asked to specify its constituents according to the category list above  . New words may be typed in by the user or read in fl'om a text file  . 
It is assumed that the lexical entries to be added will belong to open lexical classes : nouns  , verbs and adjectives . To distinguish between these three classes is not an impossible task for a nonlinguist  , especially if an appropriate instruction is provided  . Adjectives are classified in a way similar to nouns  , e . g . 
nasal , bronchial-denoting body part ; stttf\[iv , rttnny ( as in sttt\[\[iy nose ) -dcnoting symptom and attribute of body part . 
A user-adapted classification of ve , ' bs is more difficult to achieve . In our preliminary model , tim user is presented questions combined with example patterns  , for instance : ' Doest im verb take an object , like investigate the effects '?' Does it also take a complement with a certain preposition like : shield the patient from house dust ?'' What preposition is required ?' If the verb in question turns out to be transitive  , a further question is asked about he semantic category of the typical object  , according to the standard category list . The specification of verbs takes more time than the one of nouns and adjectives  . However , the need of introducing new verbs is ~ su : dly not as great as the need  o17 adding new nouns . 
2 . 3 . 4 . Compound interpretation and generation of ta rget equivalents 
The present program covers the most frequent types of compounds found in the corpus  . After having filtered out the most fl'e-quent verbs  ( :mxiliaries , medals ) and items belonging to closed lexical classes ( pronouns , articles , prepositions etc . ) , we first investigated word frequencies , and then the ( unfiltered ) environment of about the thirty most frequent words  . On this basis , we could state that the most usual compounds containing the most frequent nouns  ( disregarding names of chemical substances ) display the following patterns : i . ( attribute , concretc ) - allergcn-(adj)-synd , ' omhouse dust ( allergic ) asthma ( grass ) pollen ( seasonal ) asthmaii . medicine/allergen-medical tretment antigen injection aller geniniections teroid treatment iii  .   ( time period ) -adj/allergenhnedicine- ( body part ) -scientific method allergen ( skin ) test 9 week double-blind study iv . syndrom-patient- ( countable amount ) hayfever patient group v . medicine- ( patient ) -countable amounts teroid patient group llun isolide group vi  . body part-body function/symptoms k in lly per responsiveness airway patcncy vii  . ( attribute , concrcte ) -a Ilergen-time period grass pollen season function -time periods teroid treatment period house dust inhalation period The procedure fot ' compound interpretation is base  ( I on a Prolog formalization of the most frequent patterns  . " File following program fragment shows what the format for basal lexical entries looks like and how the interpretation rules are constructed  .

lcx--~basic lexical entry flex = temporary lexical entry The rules simply specify the dcfimlt interpretation of a sequence of nouns and deliver ase-manlic representation coded in ' MachineseEnglish '  , as shown in the outprints below : ? ~ interpret ( \[ house , dust , as lh , na , patien(\]) mean(\[patient , sufforing__ . from , syndmm(\[asthma , because_of , allergen(\[house , dust\] ) l ) Dgrammatical category : n semantic ategory :\[ patient\]:-interprct  ( \[ house , dust , inhalation l ) m can ( linhalation , of object , allcrgen(\[house , dust l ) l ) ! ~ I ' anlnlalical category : n semantic ategory : I hody_l'unction lThe Machinesel'e presen latio  , ~s can without difficulties be matched with the appropriate target morphosyntactic patterns  . For example , the semantic representation of grass pollen a sthmal  ) a tie Ht becomes associated with the Polish pattern ( simplified notation ) : patic nt , suff crin ~ from , syndrom(\[X , bccause of , allcrgen ( attr , All )\]) --> n(paticnt , Agr , nom ) , ln'tact(suffer , Agr , nom ) , prep(suflEr , Prcp , Case ) , n(X , Agr2 , Case ) , prt pass(cause , Agr2 , Case ) , n(allergy , Agr3 , in s ) , prcp(_ , na , ack ) , n(All , Agr3 , ack ) , n(Attr , agr(Gen , pl) , gen) .

Still , certain ambiguities may remail ~: the present program can  , for example , nol decide whether x r as . vpollen asthma should bc translated into l : r cn ch as a sthmei  , ,> l'herbe . The decision has to be made by the user . 
Translation of frequent compounds of the type noun + past participle  ( allergen-shielded , allergen-tested , place bocontrolled ) is handled in a way similar to the one used in the prototype program when translating compounds like university teacher and univetwity killer  . The semantic category of the noun is compared with the ~ mantic specification of the wdency of the verb stem and the noun is associated with the most probable verbal argument  . Thus , aller genshielded tvom is interpreted as ' a rooins hielded fi'om allergen '  , while allergent ested skingets the reading ' sk in tested by exposure to aller-gen '  . 
3. CONCLUSIONS ANDIMPI . ICATIONS
I ; ORFUR'FItEI~RI , ; SEAI:tCI ! 3 . 1 . Remaining problems The method proposed here has so far led to good translation results  . However , the problem lies not only in interpreting a CO lnp ( mnd , but also in identifying an English word sequence its a compound  . For the time heing , we use a pars-ins procedure based on a combination of dependency grammar and categorial grammar  . The main parsing difficulty , when dealing with an English input , is to decide whether a lexical stem functions as a finite predicate or as a noini-nal  . We try to remove the ambiguity by starting the parsing by a procedure called ' verb finder '  , searching for possible candidates for the predicate function  . The function o1"ambiguous items , like result , control etc . , may often be identified on tim basis of their evironmeut : if tile word in question is immediately preceded by a preposition and/or an article  , it can be easily identified as a nominal element . The parsing procedure may still be made more efficient by utilizing re-stilts of statistic investigations of tile corpus  ( Steier & Below 1991 , Johansson 1993) . 
3.2. Future plans
Tim advantage of the model outlined here lies in the fact that the general approacll to the grammar underlying the translation system may be adapted to differei~t domains without violating any theoretical assumptions  , tlow-ever , the theory solely does not guarantee a high -quality translation  . The preliminary system outlined above is to be developed and improved along the following lines :   0 statistical methods will be used in order to reduce ambiguities and to discover coocurrence patterns on tile basis of larger corpora  0 the medical vocabuhu'y will be enlarged by using hirge compui  , 'ltional medical databases ( e . g . MEDLINE ) and by consnlting specialists who are native speakers  o1" the languages involved in the system 0 the interactive procedures will be evaluated l . lud refined by testing their tisel Tuh~ess in experiments with nonlinguists  . 
The results of the corpus investigations and the experiments with translation of abstracts amto be used in a system for automatic abstracting and multilingual bstract generation  .
