Abstract
Recent theoretical descriptions of the Icelandic case system distinguish between lexicai and structural case  . Lexical case is assigned in ttle lexi-COIl , where a structural case is assigned in syntax , undertim provision that it does not override lexicai case assignment  . This analysis is problematic for grammatical theories such as Categorial Unification Grammar  ( CUG ) and Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar ( HPSG ) as the introducion of a syntactic case cmnponent is incompatible with the lexicalistideology underlying these frameworks  . Furthermore , the default character of syntactic case introduces a procedural aspect into the grammar which goes agains the derlarative spirit of unification-based frameworks in general  . In this paper , I propose an alternative an Mysis , formulated in terms of CUC , , in which all case constraints are expressed lexically and in which default reasoning is restricted to nonmonotonic nheritance of lexicai information only  . 
1 In t roduct ion : Case Mark ing and Defau l t s The Icelandic case marking system I has often been taken as evidence for a distinction between structural  ( or regular or default ) and lexicai ( irregular , quirky ) case marking . This distinction is introduced to explain the following two facts  . First , most verbs select nominative case marked subjects  ( 1 )  , but a number of verbs select accusative , genitive or dative subjects (2)-(4) . Similarly , most transitive or ditransitive verbs select an accusative direct object  ( 1 )  , but some select a nominative , dative , or genitive (4)-(6) object .

The fact that the vast majority of subjects and objects is nominative and accusative  , respectively , is accounted for by assigning default status to these cases  ( that is , if nothing is said about the case of a subject or object  , assume it must be nominative or accusative , respectively ) . 
Second , passive sentences ( 7 ) - ( 8 ) and so called ' raising ' constructions ( 9 ) - ( 12 ) exhibit a distinction between regular and irregular case marked NPs  . In transformational terms , the case of regular case marked NPs corresponds with their surface position  ( (7 )  ,  (9) , and (11)) , whereas the case of irregular case marked NPs corresponds to their underlying position  ( (8 )  ,  (10) , and (12)) . ( In these examples , tc represents a lexicaily case marked NP-trace and tatrace which has not been assigned case  ( assunfing that structural case is only assigned to surface NP positions  ) ) .

The lexicai case assigned by the embedded verb vanta is preserved even if raising to object and subsequent passivization takes place  .

All previous accounts of these facts ~ have adopted the following two assmnptions : ? Lexical case is assigned in the lexicon  ( that is , before the lexical and syntactic l ) rocesses responsible for passive formatiml and raising have appfied  ) attd structural case is assigned in syntax ( after id lother syntactic processing has been completed  )  . 
? Structural case assignment is a default process which can never override lexical case assignments  . 
2 Except Saget at . ( to appear) , whose analysis is in many respect similar to the one developed below  . 
Andrews ' (1982, p . 485) LFG-based account , for instance , assumes two default conventions , ap-plical ) let of unctional structures ( that is , after syntactic processing has been cmnI ) leted ) . First , if the subject is unmarked for case ,   ( direct and indirect ) objects are accusative by default ( i . e . 
only if they are not lexically ease marked ) , and , second , an argmnent must be nominative if no other ease constraint has been imposed upon it  . 
The application of the first convention mst precede that of the second  . Zaenen et al (1985, p . 
466 ) adopt a default case marking convention which appears to be restricted to the lexicon and which assigns nominative case to the highest available grammatic M function  ( i . e . a grammatical function which is present in the argument  ( or thematic ) structure of a verb at td which has not been assigned lexical case  )  , and accusative to the next highest available grammatical fnnctiou  . Zaenen et al concentrate primarily on passives and do not present an explicit account t  ) fraising constructions . Yipctal .  (1987) , inspire ( \[ byi ( \[ eas froln auto segmental phonology , propose a system in which a case tier "\[ NOM ACC\] is associated with verbal arguments in syntatx in a left-to-right fashion  , in such a way that NOM is associated with the leftmost argument titat has not been assigned lexical case and hcc is associated with the next available argument  . Their account of raising to object assumes that case association is acyclic rule and that syntactic  ( as opposed to lexieal ) case assignments may be overwritten by syntactic ase assignments in higher cycles  . 
These proposals are prol ) lematic for standard unification-based form Misms of the PATR-II variety  ( Shieber , 1986a ) . The default constraints for nominative and accusative casentarking must not apply if : t lexical case constraint is present already  . This ilnl flies that t it ( . , default constraints cannot be added to the syntactic rules or lexical entries which introduce subjects and objects  , as this would make the constraints absolute . Rather , syntactic default case marking principles would have to be added as a filter on syntactic structures or as seperate default rules  ( much like the syntactic fi . ~ature specification defaults of GPSG ) whose application must be intertwined with syntactic processing a  . 
Admitting such extensions , however , is potentially damaging to the descriptive adequacy of  3Note that the defaults cannot be ' compiled away ' in this case  , as is proposed for the feature specification defaults of GPS  ( /in Shieber ( 1986b )  .

The proposals of Andrews (1982) and Yip ~: tal .   ( 1987 ) are also a challenge for lexicalist ttle-ories such as I\[I'SG and CUC  ,  . The problen i for lexicatist theories is that the default principles above must make use of information which is only available a  . fler a certain amount of synactic processing has taken place  . In raising to object constructions , for instance , the ques-ti<m whether the object must be assigned accusative case or not Callolrly be answered after it is known w beth cr the sul > ject of tire embedded VP is assigned lexical case or not  . These considerations have even been used ( in , la cobson ,  1990 ) as arguments against lexicalist accounts of case marking in gener M  . 
Below , I will demonstrate hat the Icelandic data canire a  . e counted for declaratively alid in a lexicalist fashion  . Ill the next section , I in : troduce a fragment of ( ; Ill\]including raising verbs and passives . Next , the distinction be-tweet lexicM and structural case is accounted for by assuming that case is encoded as a feature-coln plex and by introducing a system for nonmonotoniciiflm ritanee of lexical information  . In section 4 I show that this deeomlrosed case system makes it possible to analyze the case patterns found in passive and raising constructions as a reflection of a partial agreement relation  . 
The final section romllares the present proposal with recenl  , work by Sagctal . ( to appear) .

In particular , the treatment of raising verbs and passives will be adressed  . 
The categories of categoriM grammar can be encoded as feature-structures using tire feature CAT  ( EGORY ) to represent basic categories and the Datures VaL ( UE )  , ARG ( UMENT ) and DIR ( E ( : TIONALITY ) to represent complex care-AcrEs DECOLl NG-92 , NAb rI'ES , 2328 Ao\[rr 1992 gories .

Alleombinatory rules unify the value of the\[ unctor daughter with the feature structure of the mother aildunify the argument of the fune-tor with the argument daughter  . 
Raising verbs subcategorize for a VP-comple-ment ( i . e . a category NP\ , 5 ~ ) the subject of which is controlled by an NP -argument of the raising verb  . Following Bach ( 1979 ) I assume that the controller is always the so called ti  . ext-argur ~ er~t-itl . That is , a ' raising to subject ' verb such as seem receives the category  ( NI >\ , 5)/VP , ~Iuse X/Y and Y\X a : ~ shorthand for ( v " O = X ( v " O = X ( air ) = right and ( dir )  =  , ' ight .

This implies that such verbs combine with their object using right wrap S :  ( 17 ) expects B obtogo , VP expects to go , VP/NP Bob , NP expects , ( VP/NP)/VP to go , VP The semantic and syntactic implications of the relation between the controlling NP and the subject of the VP-complement can be implemented by making these two arguments reentrant  . I will ignore t its aspect of the analysis below ( but see Pollard & , Sag ( to appear ) for an aimlys is which makes a similar assumption )  . 
Passive auxiliaries subcategorize for a passive TVP  ( i . e . a category VP/NP with passive morphology ) and a subject NP ( that is , I adopt a lexicalized version of the analysis in Bach  ( 1980 ) ) . The fact that the subject is interpreted as the object of the '\[' VP cat  ) again be implemented by making these two argument positions reentrant  . Since raising to object verbs are functors which are reducible to TVI'  , this analysis predicts that such verbs may be passivized : a feature complex  . ' l ? bat is , instead of using a single fi ~ at nre CASE , i will use three distinct features . The feature STItU ( : T distinguishes between structural and lexical case  , and the features Lt ; X and NOM distinguish between the various lexical cases and betwee nominative and accusative structur M case  , respectively . The data in section 1 show that genitive and dative case are always lexical  ( i . e . nonstructural ) , that accusative may be lexical ( if assigned to subjects ) as well as structural ( if assigned to oll-jects )  , and that nominative is always structur M .

Structural Case
The most important tool for expressing linguistic generalizations in unification-based for nta-fisms is the template meclmnism  . In this section , I iutroduce the template system for case and show how nonmonotonic template inheritance call be used to account for the default character of structur M case  . 
The distinction between lexical and structural case can be made explicit if case is encoded as  5The feature structures aboven code only the directionality of fimctors  , not their mode of comhination ( i . e . 
application or wrap ) . It is possible to add a feature which encodes this information explicitly  .

Note that tile fact that accusative acts a , sa structural case for objects has been added explicitly  . 
Both structural and lexical case assigning verbs are defined in terms of tlm templates ill  ( 20 )  . For structur M case assigning verbs only their category needs to be specified  . The detinitions of lexicM case assigning verbs , on the other hand , will contain explicit case constraints . To avoid feature-clashes , I assume that these irregular verbs inherit nonmonotonically from the  tern-9   7 PROC . OFCOLING-92, NANTES , AUG . 2328, 1992 plates above : (21) kyssti:(TV ) .

In these definitions , the '!'- prefix ( comparable to the overwrite operator of PATR-H ) indicates that the following constrMnt contains nondefault information which may surpress the inheritance of incompatible information from other sources  ( i . e . the template TV ) . Thus , h jalp ~ i denotes the feature struture ( where IV is left unexp and - ed ) : dir right\[cat ~: I'

Note also that vantar assigns \] exicM(i . e . nonstructural ) accusative case to its subject . 
The definitions above capture the intuitive difference between structural and lexical case  . 
If a verb assigns structural , default case , only its category needs to be specified , the relevant case constraints follow by inheritance  . If a verb assigns lexical case , however , case must be specified explicitly . Althought ids analysis introduces a limited form of nonmonotonicity  , his does not endanger the declarative nature of the grammar  . 
The definitions in ( 21 ) still denote feature structures ~ and thus , the effect of combining default and nondefault information can be computed at compile time  . That is , there are no formal difl'er-ences between a grammar using nonmonotonic inheritance and a grammar which does not  . Furthermore , in Bouma ( to appear ) it is demomstrated that the inheritance operation itself can be defined declaratively  . What is gained by using nonmonotouic nheritance is the fact that it supports a direct and natural implementation f certain linguistic observations  . 
4 Case Preservation
In this section I argue that the case preservation pheuomena which can be observed in raising and passive constructions are a reflection of a  ( partial ) case agreement relation between two
NP-argument positions.
A c'r ~ DECOLING-92 , NANTES , 2328 aotrr 199298 ~ brraising to subject verbs , for instance , the case of controlling subject is M ways identical to the subject case constraint specified by the embedded VP  ( that is , I assume that infinitival verbs may specify structural  , nominative , case for their subject ) . Thus , raising to subject verbs can be defined as in ( 23 )  . The paths ( valarg ) and ( arg arg ) refer to the controlling and controlled NP , respectively . 
(23) R-to-S : ( xv/yp(valarg struct ) = ( a , : qargstruct ) ( , , . 1  .   . jlex ) : ( . , g . , 9l~x ) ( .   . t . , vnora ) = ( . - j "' V , , or e)) . 
The feature structures denoted by this template and by the templates defined below are shown in figure  1  . 
Raising to object verbs , on the other hand , do not take nominative objects and thus require that their object is \[ NOM-\]  . The other case features again agree : ( 24 ) R-to-O : (   ( IV/NP ) /VP ( valau In or a )  = - ( valarg struct )  =  ( an 2 arg struct )   ( vala ~ lex )  :  ( ar9 arglex )   )  . 
Note that if the VP-complement assigns nominative case to its subject argmnent  , the object is specified as \[ STItUCT+ , NOM-\] , This impfies that the object must be accusative , as only the case template Ace will unify with this specification  . In all other cases , the lexical case assigned by the Vl'-complement will be preserved  . In particular , a lexical accusative subject gives rise to the following derivation :  ( 25 ) tall 6 vantapening a , \[valIV\]dir right/\[catnp\]/\[\ ]/ ar/struct-//taiiS  , vantapening a , dirht\[\]\]structnp\]1PRoc .

In passives , the question whether a nomina ~ tire subject will appear or not is determined by the question whether the object of tim TVP-complement receives tructural case or not  . If the object was marked for one of the lexical cases GEN or I  ) AT , this case will also appear on the subject . A structural accusative object gives rise to a\[ NOM-~-  , LEXACC\]specitication for the subject , which is unitiable with the case template NOM only  . Alexieai accusative object ( as in (25)) , ontit ( . ' other hand , gives rise to a \[ NOM- , LEXACC\]sul ) ject , a specilic at i ( m which is only unifiable witilAcc . Note that this accounts for example (13) , which showed that lexical accusative case imlst be preserved in passive constructions  . 
5 Concluding Remarks
In the previou sections I have argued that , contrary to what has been assumed in previous work  , the I cehm diccase system does not provide compelling evidence for the introduction of a nonlnonotonic syntactic ase conlpollent  . 
The same conclusion is reached by SagetaL ( to appear )  , who present an analysis formulated in terms of IIPSG  ( Pollard & Sag ,  1987 , to appear ) which emphasizes the theoretical and methodologic ~davantages of a declarative  , lex~icallst , solution . Their analysis rests on the as-sulnption that case is encoded using the two  fea-tltl'e8 CASI . ; atld I)CASI ' ; ~ where the latter i8 used t ( ) encode the default c~L ~ ( : of certain argument tmsitio as . The distinction between structured and lexical case assigning verbs is implemented as follows : Non-quirky verbs require that the DCASE and CASE values of their subjects be identified  ( structure-shared )  . 
Quirky verbs impose uosnch identity , and select at particular CASE value for their subject  . 
\[ t is assumed that raising verbs specit ~? that tile controlling and controlled NI ' are reentraut  . 
Note that this predicts that the case of a lexical  ( quirky ) case assigning verb is always preserved . If a raising verb combines with a Vt'-conq ) lentent which assign structural case to its subject  , the features ChS ~ ; and D ( ' ASE of the controlling NI'will also be reentrant  . Since objects are always ( lexically ) specilied as \[ PEASEA ( : C\] , this implies that araising to object verb which coml  ) in es with a structural case assigning VP nmst take an accusative case marked object  . Subjects are assumed to be marked as I ) ?: ASl . ; NOM \] by the syntax rule which introduces subjects  . Thus , raising to subject verbs that coin bine with a structural case assigning VP can only take a nominative suhject  . 
The fact that the ca . se of subjects is deter-n fined at least in part by syntax is surprising  , given the lcxicalist ~ p proach advocated by Sag Acres DE  COLING-92  , NAI , rI'I ~ S , 2328 Ao~r 199299 Paoc . o ~, COLING-92, N^NTUS , A ~6 . 23-28, 1992 et al . It is essential for their analysis , however , that subjects of infinitives are not assigned nominative default ease in the lexicon  , as this would make it impossible for a raising to object verb to combine with its VP-complement  6  . In the account above , there was no need to introduce syntactic case marking principles  . One might even maintain that this account , apart from being truly lexica\[ , also has the advantage that it avoids the procedural flavor of the analysis of Sag et al  , which , a3 though formulate declara-tively , makes essential use of the fact that nominative default case is imposed during syntactic processing  , whereas all other case constraints are imposed beforehand  ( i . e . in the lexicon ) . 
Sag et al ( to appear ) do not adress the case marking patterns of passives  . The most obvious way in which their analysis could cover these facts would be to assume the passive lexical rule presented in Pollard & Sag  ( 1987 , p . 
215) . This seems to account for the facts immediately , given the additional assumi ) tion that objects are marked as \[ DCASI~ACC\] after passive has applied  . Note , however , that this would imply a slightly different lexical component than is standardly assumed in HPSG  , and , perhaps nmre disturbing , would introduc explicit ordering of lexical rules or rule types  .
