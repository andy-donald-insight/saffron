Abstract
Selectional restrictions arc semantics ortal constraints iln posed on the particil  ) ants of linguistic constructions to capture contextually-dependent constraints on interpretation  . Despite their l in fitations , selectional restrictions have t ) roven very useflfl in natural bmguage ap-pli ( ' ations , where they have been used frequently in word sense disambiguation  , syntactic disambiguation , and anaphora resolution . Given their practical wtlue , we explore two methods to incorporate selectional restrictions in the HPSG theory  , assuming that the reader is familiar with HPSG . The first method eml ) loys It PSG ~ SBACKGROUND feature and a constraint -satisfaction comt  ) onentt ) il ) e-lined after the parser . The second method uses subsorts of retbrential indices  , and 1) locks readings that viol at (' , sole(:-tional restrictions during parsing . While theoretically less satisfactory , we have Ibund the second method particularly usefl fl in the development of practical systems  . 
1_ I n t roduct ion ~ lPhe term selectional restrictions refers to semantic sortal constraints imposed on the  1  ) ar-ticipants of linguistic constructions . Selectional restrictions arc invoked , for example , to account t br the oddity of (1) and (3) ( cf . (2) and (4)) . 
(1) ? To mate a keyboard.
(2) To mate a banana.
(3) ? Tom repaired the technician.
(4) Tom repaired the keyboard.
~IPo account br(1) and (2) , one would typically introduce a constraint requiring the object of " to eat " to denote an edible entity  . The odd-ity of ( 1 ) can then be attributed to a violation of this constraint  , since keyboards are typically notedible . Silnilarly , in ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) one could postulate that " to repair " can only be used with objects denoting artifacts  . This constraint is violated by (3) , because technicians are typically persons , and persons are not artifacts . 
We note that selectional restrictions attempt to capture contextually-dei  ) endent constraints on interpretation . There is nothing inherently wrong with (1) , and one can think of special contexts ( e . g . where Tom is a circuspert brmer whose act includes gnawing on comtmterpe-ripherals  ) where ( 1 ) is felicitous . The oddity of ( 1 ) is due to the fact that in most contexts l ) eople do not eat keyboards . Similarly , (3) is ti ; licitous in a science-fiction context where the technician is a robot  , rot not in most usual contexts . Selectional restrictions are typically used to capture flints about tlm world which are gen-c  . r ~ lly , but not necessarily , true . 
In w ~ rious forms , selectional restrictions have been used tbr many years  , and their limitations are wellknown ( Allen ,  1995) . For example , they cmmot account brlnetaphoric uses of language  ( e . g .  (5)) , and they run into 1 , roblen , s in negated sentences ( e . g . unlike (1), there is nothing odd about (6)) . 
(5) My car drinks gasoline.
(6) Tom cannot catakey board.
Despite their limitations , selectional restrictions have proven very useflfl in practical applications  , and they have been employed in several largescale natural language understanding systems  ( Martin et al , 1086) ( Alshawi ,  1992) . 
A part fl ' om blocking pragmatically il Mbrmed sentences like  ( 1 ) and ( 3 )  , selectional restrictions can also be used in word sense disanfl  ) igua-tion , syntactic dismnbiguation , and anaphora refers to at computer peripheral , while in (8) it refers to a person . The correct sense of " printer " can be chosen in each case by requiring the object of " to repair " to denote an artifact  , and the subject of " to call " ( when referring to a phone call ) to denote a person . 
(7) Tom repaired the printer.
(8) The printer called this morn filg.
Silnilarly ,   ( 9 ) is from a syntactic point of view potentially ambiguous : the relative clause may refer either to the departments or the employees  . The correct reading can be chosen by specifying that the subject of " retire "  ( the relativised nominal in this case ) must denote a person . 
(9 ) List tile employees of the overse as depart-nlents that will retire next year  . 
Giventile value of selectional restrictions in t ) ractical applications , we explore how they can be utilised in the HPS ~ theory  ( Pollard and Sag ,  1994) , assuming that the reader is familiar with HPSG . On r proposals are based on experience obtained from using IIPSG in a natural language database interface  ( Androutsot ) oulos et al , 1998) and a dialogue system for a mobile robot . To the best of our knowledge , selectional restrictions have not been explored so far in the context of HPSG  . 
We note that , although they often exploit similar techniques ( e . g . semantics orthier archies ) , selectional restrictions cost it ntea different topic from linking theories  ( Davis ,  1996) . 
Roughly speaking , linking theories explore the relation between thematic roles  ( e . g . agent , patient ) and grammatical thnctions ( e . g . subject , complement ) , while selectional restrictions attempt to account br the types of world entities that can fill the thematic roles  . 
We discuss in sections 2 and 3 two ways that we have considered to incorporate selectional restrictions into HPSO  . Section 4 concludes by comparing briefly the two approaches . 
2 Background restrictions
The first way to accommodate selectional restrictions in HPSGUSeS the 
CONTEXTIBACKGROUND ( abbreviated here as CX lBG ) feature , which Pollard and Sag ( Pollard and Sag ,  1994 ) reservet br " Micity conditions on the utterance context "  , " presuppositions or convention aliml ) licatures " , and " at ) prot ) riateness conditions " ( opcitpp .  27, 332) . To express electional restrictions , we add q fp so as ( quantifier-flee parameterised states of at fairs ) with a single semantic role ( slot ) iI1 CXIBG . 1 For exanlple , apart fi'om the eat qf'p soa in its NUCLEUS ( NUt )  , the lexical signt br " ate " ( shown in ( 10 ) ) would introduce an edible qfpsoa in Bo , requiring\[\] ( the entity denoted by tile object of " ate " ) to be edible .

For our purposes , however , tile simplistic prin-co ) Ic of contextual consistency of Pollard and Sag will suffice  . This principle causes the BG value of each phrase to be the union of tile BG values of its daughters  . Assuming that the lexical sign of " keyboard " is  ( 12 )  , (10)-(12) cause (1) to receive (13) , that requires\[\] to denote an edible keyboard .

Ill natural bmguage systenls that targets l ) ec if i ( : and restricted olm fins , however , constructing such hier ; ~ r chies is feasible , because the relevant entity sorts and the possible hierarchical reb ~ tions between them are limited  . 
In natur Mlmlguage database interfimes , t brexample , the relevant entity sorts and the relations between the lnnre often identilied during the  , ( tesing of the database , in the tbrm of entity-relatiol M li1) diagrams .

To decide whether or not a sentence violates any selectional restrictions  , we collect from the CONT and BO features of its sign  ( (13 ) in the case of ( 1 ) ) all the single-role qfpsoas for which there is a sort in the hierarchy with the same name  .   ( This rules out single-slot q t ~ ) so as introduced by the CONTs of intransitive verbs  . ) The decision can then be seen as a constraint -satisthction problem  , with the collected q fp so as acting as constraints . (15) shows the constraints tbr(1) , rewritten in at brm closer to predicate logic . HPSG indices ( the boxed nmnbers ) are used as variables . 
(15) kcybd(~\])Aman(~)Aedible(~\])
Given two contstraints cl , c2 on the same vari-al)le , c ~ subsumes c2 if the corresponding hierarchy sort of clisan ancestor of that of  c2 or if cl = c2  . c ~ and c2 can be replaced by a new single constraint c , if cl and c2 subsume c , and there is no other constraint d which is subsumed by cl  , c2 and subsumes c . c and c'must be constraints on the same variable as ct  , c2 , and must each correspond to a sort of the hierarchy  . If the constraints of a sentence can be turned in this way into at brm where there is only one constraint fbreach variable  , then ( and only then ) the sentence violates no selectional restrictions . 
(15) , and cdil ,   , ' a mot be re-p\]aced by a single constraint , because keybdandedible have no common subsorts . Hence , a selectional restriction is violated , which accounts for the oddity of (1) . In contrast , in (2) the constraints would be as in (16) . 
(16 ) banana ( ~ ) Aman ( m ) Aedible ( ~\] ) banana ( ~\] ) and cdible ( F  ~ ) can now be replaced by banana ( F  ~ )  , because both subsume banana(~\]) , and no other constraint subsmned by both banana ( ~\] ) and cdible ( ~ ) subsulnes banana ( ~ )  . This leads to ( 17 ) and the conch > sion that ( 2 ) does not violate aw selectional restrictions . 
(17) banana(E\])Aman(D\])
This constraint-satisfaction reasoning , however , requires a set ) a rate inferencing component that would be pipelined after the parser to rule outsigns corresponding to sentences  ( or readings ) that violate selectional restrictions . In the next section , we discuss an alternative approach that allows hierarchies of world entities to be represented using the existing HPSG framework  , and to be exploited during parsing without an additional inferencing component  . 
3 Index subsorts
HPSG has already a hierarchy of feature structure sorts  ( Pollard and Sag ,  1994) . This hierarchy can be augmented to include a new part that encodes int brmation about the types of entities that exist in the world  . This can be achieved by partitioning the refHPSO sort  ( currently , a leaf node of the hierarchy of feature structures that contains all indices that refer to world entities  ) into subsorts that correst ) ond to entity types . To encode the information of figure 1 , rEf would have the snb sorts abstract and physical  , physical would have the subsorts animate , edible , inanimate , and so on . That is , referential indices are partitioned into sorts , mid the indices of each sort can only be anchored to world entities of the corresponding type  ( e . g . keybd indices can only be anchored to keyboards ) . 
With tiffs arrangement , the lexical sign for " ate " becomes (18) . The Boedible restriction of ( 10 ) has been replaced by the restriction that the index of the object must be of sortedible  .

Figure 2: Declarations of q fp so as 4 Conclusions We have presented two met ; hods to incorporate selectional restrictions ill I lPSG :  ( i ) expressing selectional restrictions as BACKGROUND constraints  , and ( it ) en q ) loying subsorts of referen-trial indices . The first method has the advantage that it requires no modification of the cmT ent IIP SO feature structures  . It also lnz dntains Pollard and Sag's distinction bel  ; ween " literal " mid " nonliteral " meaning ( expressed t ) yCeNT and I~ACKGI/OUN\] ) respe , ctively ) , a distinction whi ( ' his lflm'red in the second approach ( e . g . nothing in ( 18 ) shows th ~ lt requiring the obje ( ' t to denote an edil ) leentity is part of the nonliteral meaning ; of .  (10)) . Unlike the tirst method , however , the second apt ) roachre ( tuires no additional ta-ft ; renting comtionent br determining when se-lecl ; ional restrictions h~tve been violated . With sentences that contain several potentially aiil-lfiguous words or phrases  , t ; 11( , , second apl)roat:h is also more etlicienl ; , ~ ls it blocks signs that violal x ' , selection nltesta'tel ; ions during parsing . 
In the tirsl ; aplm ) ach , these signs remain undetecte during parsing , and they may have a multiplicativ effect , h;ading to a largen mn ber of parses , which then have to l ) echecked individually by the taft ; renting component . We have timnd these ( : on dat ) l ) roacht ) articularly useful in the develolnnent of practical systems  . 
There is a deet ) er question here al ) out the proper place to maintain the kind of int brnla-lion encoded in selectional restrictions  . The applicability of selectional restrictions is always context-dependent  ; and for any selectional restriction , we can ahnost always find a context where it does not hold  . Our second method above effectively admits that we cromer develop a general tmrl Iosc solution to the problem of meaning interprel  ; ation , and that we have to at-cept that our systems alwws operate in specific contexts  . By committing to a particular context of interpretation  , we ' compile into ' what was traditionally thought of as literal meaning a thus enable these constraints to assist in the HPSG language analysis without requiring an additional reasoning component  . We take the view here that this latter approach is very appropriate in the construction of real applications which are  , and are likely to be ibr the tbresee-able future , restricted to operating in limited domains .
