Determiners play an important role in conveying the meaning of an utterance  , but they have often been disregarded , perhaps because it seemed more i ~ portant to devise methods to grasp the global meaning of a sentence  , even if not in a precise way . 
Another problem with determiners is their inherent a ~ bigulty  . 
In this paper we propose a logical formaliem , which , among other things , is suitable fc~representing determiners without forcing a particular interpretation when their meaning is still not clear  . 

Ambiguity of determiners is one of the most striking phenomena of natural language  ; what is strange is the case with ~ hich humans use them : it seems that the molteplicity of interpretations of an cun phrase including a determiner is not explicitly perceived by human users of rmtural language \[ Hobbs  1983\]  . The approach we chose tries to model this behavier : each determiner has a charac ~ teristic semantic interpretation  , which is different from that of ot\]qer determiners and which can be furtherly specified an the basis of the information contents gathered from the overallean ~ text and frfxn the remsining part of the sentence  . If such an information contents is rot sufficient  , then the meaning of the determiner remains ambiguous  . What is of paramount i ~ rtance is that any determiner has a " single " meaning  , that can be furtherly specified by the context . 
Of course , we need to express these ~ sntics of determiners by means of a suitable representation  . The one that we propose seems to be intuitively acceptable  , formally precise and suitable for a cm~positional analysis of natural language that  , even if questien-able in some particular cases , is still one of the approaches that guarantee the most reasonable degree of generality in semantic interpretation  . 
It is obvious that the representation of a sentence in such a fon~sliem may contain ambiguities  ; therefore a further step is needed in order to obtain an unambigtmus deep specification of its meaning  . Contrarily to the intermediate logical formalism we are going to discuss  , this firml specification will rot be given in declarative form  , but in terms of operations on an underlying knowledge base  . 
REPRESENTATION FOR MALISM
Ct ~ main goals in designing the representation formalism that will be used in the following sections were : I  ) To maintain a close relationship between the pieces of informs-tion that are intuitively present in the input sentence and the predicates appearing in its interpretation  . 
2 ) To make explicit the distinction between surface objects and semantic entities : words on one side and concepts  , individuals , classes etc . on the other . 
3 ) To maintain a cojitional analysis of language , where the starting point is provided by the dependency tree built by the rule ~ bassd syntactic cogent of the FIDO system\[Le~no  , To rasso 84; Les~o , To rasso85 a ; Lesmo , To rase o 85 b \] .

A first example concerns a very simple sentence :
I ) Bobloves Lucy.
The representation is ( lowercase strings refer to variables ; uppercase ones to constants or predicates ) : Ir ) REF ( S , x , BOB ) & REF(S , y , LOVE ) & RFF(S , z , LUCY ) & AG ~ F ( y , x ) &

This can be read as : there are three internal entities  ( x , y , z ) ; the speaken ( S ) is referring to the first of them by using the word BOB  , to the second with TOLOVE , to the third with LUCY ; the agent of y is x , its obiect is z . Fig . 1 depicts , in terms of nodes and arcs , the proposed representation . REF predicates are meant to indicate the mapping between words and internal nodes  . Consider nowex . 2: 2 ) The boy loves a girl The representation reported below disregards the information con~tents gathered from the determiners :  2r   ) REF ( S , x , BOY ) & REF(S , y , LOVE ) & R\[F(S , y , GIRL ) & A(~r(y , x ) &
OBJECT(y , z)
The representation is analogous to the previous one  . On the other hand , some problems arise in this case ; they concern the com ~ uni ~ eative impact of ex . 2 , and which were not evident in the previous exan ~ ) le . If we say " Bob loves Lucy " , we assume that whoever hears this sentence knows both Bob and Lucy  , so that he is able to reconstruct the right semantic interpretation  , and to identify the specific individuals to whom the speaker is referring  . But how can the hearer convey such kind of informmtion when explicit names are not available ? And  , on the opposite side , how can the speaker tell the hearer that he is not referring to any specific individual  , but he wants to mention a general property of the class ? We believe that the discriminating information is carried by determiners  . If we take them into account , we should state that ex . 2 expresses something as : " BOY ( this word should suffice for y cat o identify whom I'm talking about  ) LOVESGIRL ( this word is not specific enough to allow you to identify the correct referent  ) " or , if we think of a knowledge base represented as a semantic net ~ work : " Dearhearer  , you should find a node satisfying the ' BOY ' description  ( and if ysu consider the context , this can be done unambiguously ) , then y ca should create a new node of type ' GIRL ' and connect them via an ede which is an ' ACT~OF ' LOVE '"

We ' can give now the complete representation of ex  . 2:2 r ') RFF(S , x , BOY ) & IDENTIABLE(S , S , x ) & ENABLESAF ~ REF(S , H , BOY ) & REF(S , y , LOVE ) & REF(S , z , GIRL)&IDENTIABLE(S , S , z ) and not ENABII ~ AMF ~ , '(S , H , GIRL ) & AGF/~\]'(y , x ) & OBJECT(y , z ) that is : " The . ~ ) eaker is referring to entity x by ~ eans of the ~ rdBOY  , he assumes that x is identifiable to himself and that the description used  ( BOY ) enables the hearer to refer to the same entity ; there Ls also an act of loving ( y ) and another entity ( z ) what \] he is referring to by means of the word GIRL  ; z is identifiable to himself , but the word GIRL will not enable the hearer to refer to the same entity he is thinking about  . Finally , x is the agent of y and z is the object of y " . 
Actually , 2r ' does not correspond exactly to sentence 2 . In fact Ex . 2 is mr biguous whilst2r ' is not . The source of ambiguity is the NP " agirl " . In the previous discussions we . assumed that the speaker knows the girl loved by " the boy "  , but this is not necessarily true . Tne " specific " reading is given in 2r ' by the presence of the predicate IDENTIFIABLE ( S , S , z ) . Now , how can we account for the inherent ambiguity of the indefinite determiner ? Simply droppi ~ from its sei & nntics the " IDENTIABLE " prcdicate : it will be added in case the context provides m ~fficient clues to infer the " specific " interpretation  , or its negation ( " notIDEN = TIFIABLE " ) will be added in case some evidence about a " generic " interpretetion is available  . No predicate is added ( and the sen~-tence remains a ~ bi\[~ous , as it actually is ) if no disambign ~ ating criterium is provided by the context  . 
the approach exemplified above will be de ~ . ~ ribed in the next section , covering the definite and Jndef\]nite determiners  . The predicates used are listed below , together with an explanation of their intuitive meaning  . 
REF(x , y , z ) : Individual x is able to refer to eatity y by means of expression z  . 
ENABLESAMERI . Im(x , y , z ) : Ir ~\] ividual x assures that individualy is able to identify  , by i ~ eans of expression z , the s~meentity which he refers to . 
IDENTIFIABLE(x , y , z ) : Individual x assumes that individualy is able to identify  ( or that y knows ) entity z . 
Sl~2 ( x ) : Entityx is a set composed of at least t ~ c elements  . 
ARBITRARY(x , z ) : Any member of the class x identified by be expression z necessarily satisfies the property expressed by the pro ~ position in which z occurs  . 
REPRFSFN ? ATION CFDEI~ERMINERS
We wi\]1 de ~ . ribe ~ ne representations we have adopted for determiners  , fell . owing the classification introduced in \[ Croft 85\]  , which we . report here ( note , however , that the ARBITRARY predicate introduced above does not correspond to ' arbitrary ' in Croft's c \] assification  , only to its ' not defeasible ' subclass):
Pereeptual \] y available ( this , that ) -Not percept ~ ally available : Identifiable ( the , anaphoric pronouns )
Not identifiable : '-- Spnoific ( specific , epistemica )
Arbitrary : . . . . Defeasible ( generic/intensional a ) ~' ~ Not defeasible ( any ) Table I lists the various representations we have adopted  , b ) tus consider first the definite determiners ( we are not going to discuss what Enoft refers to as ' perceptually available '- referent determiners  , i . e . de~mstratives like ' this ' and ' that ') . 
Tne representation for ' the ' reported in table I can be para " phrased as : " there exists an entity that the speaker is able to refer to by ma ~s of the expression following the determiner  ; the speaker as am~s that that expression will enable the hearer to refer to the ~ meentity  ; the speaker is ~ leto identiDI the referred entity "  . An example is provided by 3 ) I1ragazzomangia ( The boy is eating ) 3r ) REF ( S , x , BOY ) & ENABLES AF ~ REF(S , H , BOY ) & IDENTIABLE(S , S , x ) & REF(S , y , TOEAT ) & A . C6 lJT(y , x ) It~st be noted that it is not written anywhere that the entity x has to be m ~ individual  . In principle , it could be a generic entity ( i . e . an ' intensional ' node of a semantic not ) , thus fulfilling the role of ' prototype individual'\[Grosz  , Jo~qni , ~ in ~ stein83\] . 
A few ~ rds now to discuss plurals . For example : 4 ) Iragazzimangiano ( The boys are eating ) 4r ) REF ( S , x , BOY ) & ~ NABLESAF ~_ , ' . REF(SjI , BOY ) & IDEN ? IFIABLE(S , S , x ) & R~(S , y , TORAT ) & AGENT(y , x ) & SEIT ( X ) The enly difference is the presence of the predicate  SET2  ( x )  , ~ hich states that the entity x is a set . We use the r ~ SEF2 to evidentiate that it refers to the pretheoretical notion of set as ' a group'ca ~posed by mere than or e element  . 
As regards in definite determiners , the representations given in Table I can be paraphrased as : " There is an entity that the speaker is able to refer to by means of the expression following the determiner  ; the speaker cannot assume that that expression will enable the hearer to refer to the seme entity "  . Let us consider first the ' specific ' meaning of the determiner'a':  5  ) Unuor r ~ entre ' adagionel \] astanza ( A manquietly entered ther ( x \] ~ ) 5r ) HEF ( S , x , MAN ) & not ~ NAB\[%SA~REF(S , I-I , MAN ) & REF(S , y , DNTER ) & REF(S , z , ROOM ) & ENABLF/IA ~ . REF(S , H , ROOM ) & AG , ~\]'(y , x ) & Ir E(y , z ) & MDD(y , w ) & REF(S , w , QUIETLY ) & not ARBITRARY(x , MAN )   ( note that the speaker assumes that the use of the lexeme ' room ' enables the he ~' erto identify the specific room he is thinking about  )  . This interpretation is the simplest one , since it directly encodes the basic m~ning of ' the indefinite determiner  , i . e . the reference to an unspecified entity . 
A first problem is how to get the ' generic ' r reaning f ~ i i this representation  ( epistemic and intensio ~ linter pretations will be analyz cwlafter w ~ lrds  , since they do not appear as subjnots of sentences  )  . In : 6 ) Unonsova in let argoin in verno ( A bear hibernates in winter ) you could probably perceive a ~ r ~@ tning such as : " If yea  randar6y pick a niedividtml bear , then yea will see that it hibernates in winter ; of course , the beary ~ l will select will probably rmt be the same bear I am thinking of  , but it still hibernates in winter " . Notice that this paraphrase ( as we a assmeit is ) does not i\[~oly the existence of a ' prototypieal'bear tokhich the general property of ' hibernating in winter ' <' ~ i hould apply : we are referring to an arbitrary element of the class we are talking about  , although ~ . ~ are not saying that no exceptions exist . It is this non~identlfiability of the element for which the property is predicated that allows the he  ; men to obtain the state general result . 
But now , what is the difference between ex . 5 and ex . 6 ? In the first ease ( specific interpretation ) , the speaker is referring to a particular in dividt ~al  , ~ here as in the second one he is not . We . 
can state that in the specific interpretation IDE ~ \['IFIABLE  ( S , S , x ) , whereas in the generic interpretation ' not ID\[ ~I'IFIARLE  ( S , S , x)' . 
Of course , in both eases the presence of ' not ENABLESA~REF ( S , H , EXP ) ' should allow to infer that ' not IDE ~' IFIABLE ( S , H , x )' , that is , to the speaker's knowledge , x is not identifiable by the hearer by ire~mns of the expression EXP used  . Note that this does not mean that the hearer will not be able to identify x  , but only t ~ at the speaker is not willing to asssmeso  ( s ~ m examples will be provided afterwards )  . The representation we get for ex . 6 is : ~ R~(s , ? , ExP ) ~ ~ ABm ~ ___ ~ MZREF(S , H , EXP ) ~ ID ~ IF ~ IZ(S\[S , x ) IREF(S , x , EXP ) & not ENABLES A FEREF(S , H , EXP ) & not
ARBITRARY(x ) ~( S,x,,~)~~(x)\]
Table I : Sem~tie representation of the r~_aning of determiners  . 
Note that the representation includes the R ~ , ' predicate , which will be actually built upon the basis of the expression following the determiner  ,  . This has been done in order to provide a means of unifying the variable x occurring in the other predicates with the one appearing in the representation of the relmining NP  . 
3456 r ) REF(S , x , BEAR ) & not ENABLESA ~ RBE(S , H , BEAR ) & not IDENTIFIABLE(S , S , x ) & not . ~ gBITRARY(x , BEAR ) & REF(S , y , TO HIBER NATE ) & REF(S , z , WINTER ) & AC~(y , x ) & TI~(y , z) . 
It could be argued that there is no reason why in the analysis of definite determiners we allowed the ' expression ' following the determiner to refer to an intensional object  , whereas in the inde ~ finite case we do not . However , lar ~ uage works just because we assume ( sometimes incorrectly ) that a given lexeme refers to the same concept for the whole comr ~ nity of language users  . This means that ~ e cannot accept a reading where ' not ENABL NSA FEREF  ( S , H , EXP ) ' occurs and where EXP is intended to refer to a generic concept  . 
In order to discuss the other two interpretations of indefinite determiners  , we need to refer to their use in eases different from the subject of the sentence  , or , more precisely , in sentent lal contexts where there is another partecipant  , different f ~ em the speaker , who has an ' active ' role . In these cases , the represent a ~ tionm~staccount for the existence of a referentiality predicate attributed to someone different from the speaker and the hearer  . 
The first wellknown example is provided by a ' desire ' verb  , that is ' to want':7 ) John wants to nmrry a Norwegian Some different meanings can be characterized by the hearer's different replies :  7a   ) No , Ingridisn'ta Norwegian . 
7b ) Who is she ?7 c ) How does he think he can find one ? In the first case  , the speaker is using the word ' N or ~ ngian ' to refer to John's future wife  , bat the speaker does net agree on that word (*) . In the second case , the hearer assumes that the speaker is referring to a specific girl whom he does net knew  . In the third case , he assumes the speaker is not referring to any particu\]ar Norwegian  . 
In all cases there is a common core in the representation of the initial sentence  ; it is : 7r ) REF(S , x , JOI ~) & REF(S , y , TOWANT ) & REF(S , z , TOMARY ) & REF(S , w , NORWEGIAN ) & not ENABLES AMEREF(S , H , NORWEOIAN ) & not ARBITARY(w , NDR WEGIAN ) & AG ~( y , x ) & OBJECT(y , z ) &
AGENT(z , x ) & OBJECT(z , w)
To this basic interpretation , scme different predicates are added for each different case :  7ar   ) IDE~FfIFIABLE ( S , S , w ) for the standard " specific " interpretation of the indefinite determine ~  ; IDENTIABLE(H , H , w ) & not REF(H , w , NDRWEGIAN ) to state the hearer's disagreement . 
7 br ) IDENTIFIABLE(S , S , w ) & not IDENTIFIABLE(H , N , w ) 7 cr ) not ID ~ TIFIABLE(S , S , w ) But now ~ e have the possibility to characterize two subcases of c : in the first one  ( ci ) S does not know the Norwegian that John wants to m~rry  , but John does know her ; in the second ease ( c2 ) the identification is generic fer both of them : 7cir   ) IDenTIFIABLE ( x , x , w ) 7 e2r ) not IDENTIFIABLE(x , x , w ) The last determiner ( in Croft's analysis ) is " any " . Its represen~tation is reported in table I , but lack of space prevents us from discussing it ( mereover , not all students agree on its status of determiner ~ vs  . quantifier ~ and no Italian lexeme has a meaning exactly equivalent to " any "  )  . 
We list below the rules m~restrictly concerned with the operational  inter1~retation of the predicates associated with deter ~ miners :
RI ( Definite ): if REF(S , x , exp ) & ~ ABLESA ~ RBE(S , H , x ) & IDENTIABLE(S , S , x ) then leeate node ( exp , x )
R2 ( Specific indefinite ): if REF(S , x , exp ) & not ENABLESA ~ REF(S , H , x)
IDENTIABLE(S , S , x ) then create node ( exp , x ) , n ~ rk(x , ' INDIVIDUAL ' )   ( * ) Note that neither the speaker nor the bearer are necessari ~ lyright  . Fer instance , the speaker could reply " She was born in O~Io " , and the hearer "~ t last year she got the U . S . citizen ~ ship " . 

R3 ( Plural definite ): if REF(S , x , exp ) & ~ ABLESA~R ~ F(S , H , x ) & SET2(x ) then lecate set ( exp , x)
R4 ( Generic indefinite ): if REF(S , x , exp ) & not ENABBE ~ A MEBEF(S , H , x ) & not IDEN ? IFIABLE(S , S , x ) & not ARBITRARY(x , exp ) then ereate node ( exp , x ) , r ~ rk(x , ' GENERIC ~ BEFgASIBLE ' ) A few words on the functions used in the actic n part of the rules : locate node looks first for individual referents  ; if none is available it considers generic nodes . 
createned e builds a new instance of the most specific available concept identified by exp  . 
io oate set works exactly as looate node , but the node that it looks for nust represent a set  . 
Tnese rules are not complete , as they do not take into account ~ is temic and Intensional Indefinite : in fact  , both the represen~tations of these interpretations nust include the hypothetical knowledge of another individual and  , as we said before , we did not treat belief contexts . 
CONCLUDING REMARKS
Interpretation of de~terminers and quantifiers is usually over simplified in many natural language interfaces  . We think the for ~ melism discussed in this paper constitutes a significant step in representing the meaning of the sentence at a more abstract level than many interfaces do  ; at the same time we can directly exploit the features of this representation to build the actual update cor ~ n and or query  . 
Other approaches use a direct translation of the sentence from its surface form  ( or from a purely syntactic tree ) into a representation language which is actually a KB ~ ement or a DB query language  . The formalism discussed in this pages does not make any assumption on the language used for actually accessing the KB  ( and for this reason the formalism does represent the meaning of a sentence in a natural or at least'neutral'way\[Hobbs  1985  , Schubert & Pelletier 1982\]) . 
On the other hand , the formalism is not too far from the way the domain kncwledge is  ( or could be ) represented inside a KB or DB , so that it is easy to develop translation rules stating ~ nat operations on the KB or DB should be done  . 
The constraints on the available space prevented us ~ discussing the problem of using the context to disambiguate among the different meanings of a given determiner  ( e . g . specific vs . 
unspecific " a ") . Some efforts were made and the results are encouraging  , though inirony cases it is only very high-level information  ( e . g . ~ utual knowledge and beliefs ) can provide the basis for selecting the right interpretation  .
