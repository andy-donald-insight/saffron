A Phonological

This paper describes the framework of a Korean phonological knowledge base system using the unification-based grammar formalism : Korean Phonology Structure Grammar  ( KPSG )  . The approach of KPSG provides an explicit development model for constructing a computational phonological system : speech recognition and synthesis ystem  . 
We show that the proposed approach is more describable than other approache such as those employing a traditional generative phonological approach  .

Knowledge Base System Using Unification-based Formalism 
A Case Study of Korean Phonology

Korea Academy of Industrial Technology ( KAITECH )  70-6 , Yangjae-Dong , Seocho-Gu ,   S6oul Kore a syllable consists of all the segments that precede the neeleus and a retanto syllabic segments that follow the necleus  . A syllable that has no coda is called " open syllable ": one with a coda is called " closed syllable "  . According to the above definitions of a syllable structure  , the Korean syllable can be described as follows : This paper has two main goals : one is to investigate the phonological " knowledge base system for constructing a Korean speech recognition and synthesis system  , the other is to show that our formalism is more describable than other systems employing the traditional phonological approaches\[I\]  \[21  . 
A language has its own sound patterns . By sound pattens we mean ( 1 ) set of sounds that occur is a language ,   ( 2 ) the permissible arrangement of the sounds in words and  ( 3 ) the processing for adding , deleting , or changing sound\[3\] . 
A speech recognition/synthesis ystem also needs a phonological knowledge base system  ( database )  , and the rules which govern the sound sequences and the phonological processes  . 
Traditinoally , a computational phonological systems have been described and classified in terms of ' Generative  Phonology\[4\]'  , However most of those approaches are not sufficient to describe the various knowledge of a computational speech system  . 
In this paper , we show the feasibility of phonological knowledge base system with a uriification-based formalism  , and illustrate the flexibility of implementation and representation  .

Fig . 1Korean syllable structure 3 . Korean Phonology Structure Grammar As mentioned above  ,   KLSG\[5\] is a new grammar theory for the Korean language and follows a unification-based grammar such as  GPSG\[6\] and HPSG\[7\]  . An outstanding characteristic of the KLSG , which has its descriptive capability , can be described in syntatic and morphological knowledges as well as " knowledge of writting system  , phonological and semantic knowledge with a unified grammar theory  . In this paper we are only concerned with the phonological structure of the Korean language  . 
31 . The phonological feature system in KPSG All the Korean phonological categories of KPSG are presented by the sets of feature and they consist of feature and their values  . In the following , we briefly described the phonological feature structure of KPSG  . 
2 . Syllable Structure of Korean Language Aspoken language is not only a linear of sound segments  , but is a group of vowels and consonants to form large units of a sound such as syllables  , words and utterance . 
In this section we present the nature and properties of the Korean phonetic structure : Korean syllable  . The Korean syllable structure has two types : one is the type of consonant and vowel group  ( CV type : 71-:ga )  , and the other is the type of consonant , vowel and consonant group ( CVC type : 71-: gak ) . ~\[ he Korean language , however , has a predominant writing system : HANGUL which is based on sound segments and syllables  . F_zpecially , a HANGUL syllable corresponds to one character which is a combination of two or three sound symbols  . In other words , a spoken syllable corresponds to a written syllable as a one-to-one fashion  . 
Structurally , a syllable may be divided into three parts : one set  , necleus and coda . The most prominent part of a
SYL(Syllable ) <--- Consonant-Onset,
Vowel Consonant-Coda;
This feature presents the consonant and vowel according to the articulatory properties of phoneme  . 
PDF ( Phoneme Distinctive Feature ) <--- Nasal , Voiced . . . .  ; This feature presents the practical phonetic values of the 
Korean language.
FOLL ( FOLIow ) ; This feature can take a set of categories as its values : the value corresponds to a list of categories  . 
32. The Korean syllable structure rule
We can de ~ ribe the Korean syllable struture of Fig  1 using the value of FOLL features as follow : 76 i ( 1- , 1) open syllables -->
Consonant-Onset+Vowel(12) closed syllabics . --> Consnnant . -Onset+Vowel+Consonan to Cc?la(1-l')\[SYLv ; FOL\[ ,   \] - . .> \[ SYL eo ; FOLI ,  \] \[ SYL v ; FOLL  c-o\] . 
(12') SYLc-c ; FOLL1->\[SYLv ; FOLL\]\[SY Lec ; FOLLv\] . 
A careful look at the features specified in ( 11' ) and ( 12' ) will reveal that the ocurrences of the syllabic feature are predictable with the form of the rules  ; the syllabic feature appears on the set of feature similar to the lefthand side among the right hand side in the rules  . 
In the KPSG , we assume the syllable structure rule as the general rule as follow:  ( 13 ) M - -> CtI , M
CH
M'-->M\]-IM'/.j"
M /"
CH
It where M and M ' are them other categories , C and H are the daughter categories , in which C is the complement category , and t t is the head category , respectively . Since (13) is a binary . , tree , weu ~ ( 11' ) to get a syllable structure for ( 12' )  . its content is determined by the principles discussed later  . The head in a rule plays the role of a primitive in the knowledge processing of KPSG  , and the feature of head is applied by the following principle  , 
A . Head Feature Principle ( HFP)
The values of the idivklual HEAD features of the mother are indentical to the values of the HEAD features cor n ~' sponding to its head  . 
This principle guarantees that the values of these head features at the M  ( M ' ) m ? te and those at H no ? It in the ( 13 )  . The general idea behind the formulations is to state certain constraints regarding the head features  , qhehead features include SYL and PV . 
Buttim HFP does not give necessary assignment of the values to the syllable's element  . The rules for the sound sequence and the phonological processes are handled by another principle called subeat feature principle  . 
B . Subcat Feature Principle ( SFP ) '\[ he value of the FOLL feature of a head is ind cntical to the FOLL feature of its naother except for the category which is identical to its daughter  . 
The sulx ~ lt feature principle states the rdationship that hol &  ; belween the FOLL vahte of the moth cr and that of the head in a given local phonology tree  . 
C . Binding Frature Principle ( BFP ) "\[\] fis principle states the distritmtion of binding features over a given syllabic tree  . A binding fealure is a feature whose value is determined with respect to a category I~r~sibly seperatcd by a number of syllable boundaries  . " Ilf is feature plays a crucial role in describing the phonological process : vowel harmony and so on  . 
~ ihese principles are the constraints to select the adequate local syllabic tree among the inadequate local syllabic trees generated by the alxov cphonological rules : M--->CH and M'-- -> MH  . The information of the basic feature values is prepared as the concrete phoneme entry  , and is propagated a local tree to another local tree during the phonological processing  , qtm operation which determines the structure cff feature and the sets of feature is called unification  . 
The feature system in phonological knowledge base system plays a role of the declarative feature knowledge and the unification applied by the principles correspond to the procedural knowd edge which specify the rules governing the sound sequence and phonological process  . From the viewpoint of sound inventories , each rule is described deel aratively as a constraint condition which is ~ tt led among the features  . 
" 1tin equality and partiality among the feature are defined by the concept of unification  . 
4. Pratical examples
In this section we illustrate how the phonological rules in KPSG are operated  . The processes of sound change vary in the degree of naturalness  . The ~ . ~ . are various type . s of assimilations such as (1) nasalizal ~0 n , (2) palatalization ,   ( 3 ) assimilation and ( 4 ) vowel assimilation and ~ on . Among those various types of assimilation , we investigate the most colnmon type of timnasal assimilation in the Korean language  . 
(14) nasal assimilation ( nassalization ) a . k --> ~/ .   .   .   .   . \[+ na~l \] b . p-->m/ .   .   .   .   . \[+ nasal\]c . t --> n/ .   .   .   .   . \[+ nasal\] ( 14 ) is the formal descriptions of the phonological rules based on the theory of generative phonology  . The notation k->/---\[+ nasal \] is to be read as " k is rewritten as if nasal phonetics is immediately to its fight "  . ~lhe ~ rules correpond to the procedural knowledge of phonological process  . In comparison with this , unification based formalism is declarative knowledge representation  . For example , (15)\[ SYLc-o ; FOLLi ; PVa+/3\]/\SYLce ; FOLL ; PDF nasal ; PV a\]
Ic~\[SYL c-o ; FOLL SY Lec ; PDF nasal : VI3\]
I/3 ( 15 ) presents the general rule form for na~l assimulation and here  PVc~+/3means that phonetic values are composed according to the comt x  . ' sitional phonology . Now , we show the scheme of the rule form ( 15 ) with a praefial example in the case of rule ( 1-4 a ) In the ( 16 )  , the feature's values such as c-'or v , nasal , and morn , etc . colxespond to feature , SYL , PDF and PV respectively . At each node , the feature's values of the mother are passed to the head according to the head feature principle  , the syllable's Lxotm daries and agreement between the f catures are recoglrizcd and sound's value is synthesized by the feature principle  .

5. Feature Works
At present it is not clear just how to classify and integrate all the knowledge we have accumulated about the natural phonological processes into the grammars of individual languages  . We introduced a unification-based grammar formalism for phonology  . We verify that unification-based grammar formalism is a very useful theory for constructing the computational speech processing system  , similar to a syntactical system . 
In order to construct speech recognition and synthesis system  , we need a number of various knowledge sources : acoustic  , phonetics , phonology , prosody , morphology , syntax , semantics , and pragmatics . ' Fhe problem is how to represent and use those knowledges  . The knowledge representation must keep the transparency among the knowledges with a unified way  . Unification-based grammar formalism satisfy the above requirements  . 
We also attemp to describe the English phonological knowledge base system with a unification-based formalism  , and a reimplementing the Korean speech recognition/synthesis  system\[8\] with the KPSG .
