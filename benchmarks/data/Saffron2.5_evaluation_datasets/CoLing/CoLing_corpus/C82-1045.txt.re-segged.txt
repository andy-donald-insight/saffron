Practical machine translation must be considered from a heuristic point of view rather than from a purely rigid analytical linguistic method  . An English-into-Japanese translation system named ATHENE based on a Heuristic Parsing Model  ( HPM ) has been developed . The experiment shows some advantageous points such as simplification of transforming and generating phase  , semi-localization of multiple meaning resolution , and extendability for future grammatical refinement  . HPM-base parsing process , parsed tree , grammatical data representation , and translation results are also described . 
\]. INTRODUCTION
Is it true that the recipe to realize a successful machine translation is in precise and rigid language parsing ? So far many studies have been done on rigid and detailed natural language parsing  , some of which are so powerful as to detect some ungrammatical sentences If  ,  2 ,  3 ,  4\] . Notwithstanding it seems that the detailed parsing is not always connected with practically satisfying machine translations  . On the other hand actual human , even foreign language learners , can translate fairly difficult English sentences without going into details of parsing  . 
They only use an elementary grammatical knowledge and dictionaries  . 
Thu . we have paid attention on the heuristic methods of language-learners and have dew ~ eda rather nonstandard linguistic model named HPM  ( = Heuristic Parsing Model )  . Here , " nonstandard " implies that sential constituents in HPM are different from those in widely accepted modern English grammars  \[5\] or in phrase structure grammars \[6\]  . In order to prove the reasonability of HPM , we have developed an English-into-Japanese translation system named ATHENE  ( = Automatic T_ranslation of Hitachi from E_nglish into Nihongo with Editing Support  ) ~ f . Fig . I ) . 
The essential features of heuristic translation are summarized as in following three points  . 
( I ) To segment an input sentence into new elements named Phrasal Elements  ( P  E ) and Clausal Elements ( CE )  , (2) To assign syntactic roles to PE's and CE's , and restructure the segmented elements into tree -forms by inclusive relation and into list-forms by modifying relation  . 
(3) To permute the segmented elements , and to assiqn appropriate Japanese equivalents with necessary case suffixes and postpos ~ tions  . 
The next section presents an overview of HPM , which is followed in Sec .   3 by a rough explication of machine translation process in ATHENE  . Sec . 4 discusses the experimental results . Sec .   5 presents cohcluding remarks and current plans for enlargements  .

Each node corresponds to a certain " constituent of sentence "  . " Tree (~/)" is for inclusive relation , and " list ('~)" is for modifying relation . 
2 . 2 Constituent : Constituents of sentence is classified into five element such as : Word Element  , Phrasal Element , Clausal Element , Delimiting Element , and Sentence . And these elements have two values : Attribute and Syntactic Role  . 
2 . 3 Word Element ( WE ) ~ WE is the smallest consti'tuent , and therefore is an inseparable element in HPM . 
2 . 4 Phrasal Element ( P  E ) : PE is composed of one or more WE ( ' s ) which carries a part of sentential meaning in the smallest possible form  . PE's are mutually exclusive . Typical examples are : " his very skillful technique  ( N ) " , " would not have been doen(V ) " , and " for everyday production use ( PNAL ) " . 
2 . 5 Clausal Element ( CE ) : CE is composed of one or more PE ( ' s ) which carries a part of sentential meaning in a nexus-like form  . CE is nearly corresponding to a Japanese simple sentence such as : "' vwa/ga/wo/no ~  , suru/dearu\[koto\]~'CE's allow mutual intersection  . Typical examples are the underlined parts in the following : " It is important for you to do so  . " 2 . L Sentence ( SE ) : SE is composed of one or more CE ( ' s ) and is located at the bottom of a parsed tree .

2 . 9 Syntactic Role ( SR ) : SR is important ore present parsing results and to generate Japanese sentences  . For example , the sequencW of SR such as " SUBJ+GOV+OBJ"wi ll readily imply the Japanese sentence such as " SUBJ + ga/wa/no + OBJ + wo/ni+GOV "  . This implication may be quite natural for language-learners  . 
286 Y . NITTA et al 3 . TRANSLATION PROCESS From the viewpoint of simplicity and maintenability  , it might be desirable to des-cribe all the Grammatical Data  ( G  D ) in static pattern form . But unfortunately , the pattern form description is lacking in the f lexibility to change control structures  . Thus we have adopted a combination of " program " and " pattern " to describe GD  . 
In the followings , we will describe the translation process along with the examples of grara ~ atical data  ( G  D ) to be referred . The essential point of the translation process is " to replace some specified node pattern sequences with others  , under the appropriate control with grammatical data "  . This replacement process is composed of following twelve steps :  ( I ) Text Input : To produce uppermost node sequence in the parsed tree  . 
(2 ) Morphological Resolution : To reduce the inflected word to root form  . 
(3 ) Lexicon Retrieval and Attribute Assignment : To assign all possible attributes to " WE's "  . 
(4 ) Ambiguity Resolution in Attributes : To select most likely one from among many possibi  ) ities . 
(5 ) Segmentation ito " PE's " and Attribute Assignment : To make a PE from matched 
WE group and give attribute(s).
(6 ) Re-retrieval of Lexicon : To find again possible WE or PE  , especially for ? II " the separated PE " such as " take  , into consider at lon . 
(7 ) Syntactic Role Assignment to PE's : To determine Syntactic Role of PE's by referring a pattern GD as in Fig  .  4 .

4. EXPERIi4ENTALRESULTS
A pro~pemachine translation system from English in ~ Japanese named ATHENE  , as is sketched in Fig . l , has been implemented . The lexicons contain nearly . ten thousand words , not counting idioms and other multiword groups , which are mainly composed of educational basic words  ( up to senior-high-school-level in Japan ) and of about a thousand computer terminologies . Our system has translated a series of t t passages extracted randomly from English readers of senior high school and c~outer system journals  . 
The results of the tests are encouraging on the whole  . The system can translate fairly complicated sen ~ nces when equiped with the adequate gram~tical data and idiomatic phrases  . Outputs en~nc es , even though far from eloquent style , are worth postediting , and can be considerably improved with multiple meaning correction through interactive work  . Some interesting technical findings are the following :  ( 1 ) The ~ llowing items are sometime syntactically ambiguous to the system  . 
( i ) ING+N ( ambiguity among ADJ+SUBJ/OBJ , GOV+OBJ , and ~ elike ) . 
( ii ) To-infinitives ( ambigui ~ be ~ een adjective and adverbial )  . 
( iii ) Linking scope ambigui ~ w . r . t . " and ", " or ", " of " ( A and B of C for D ) . 
( iv ) Embedded appositional phrases.
(2 ) Very long PE's ( Phrasal Elements ) appear occasionally . ( eg . the PE node numbered 52 in Fig . 2 and Fig .  3) . 
5. CONCLUDING REMARKS
In this paper wet ~ to contend that machine translation should be studied from more heuristic side  , or from actual language-learner's methodology siderather than from purely rigid liguistical analysis side  . Researchers of ve ~" high level " linguistic analysis side  , as is poin ~ dout by Boitet\[8\] , " seem too often to concentrate on in , resting high level phenomen as anaphoric re ~ rence  , discourse 288 IY . NITTA et al structure , causality and reasoning and to forget at the same time persisting and very frequent lower-level difficulties  .   .   .   . " This " frequent lower-level diffi-culty " is the very problem to be solved in practical machine translation  , and is actually solved easily by naive foreign language learners only with the help of elementary grammatical knowledge  . You had better recall that language-learners must solve the whole even though it is incomplete  , on the other hand , pure linguists must solve completely even though it is very limited  . 
In the light of this contention , we have devised a heuristic parsing model named HPM to accommodate he machine translation to the actual human translation methodologies  , and at the same time , on HPM we have constructed a machine translation system named ATHENE  . Experimental translation by ATHNE shows the following advantageous points of our heuristic approach  . 
(1) Contribution to the flexibility , simplicity and maintenability in grammatical description  . 
(2 ) Contribution to the simplicity and transparency in transforming phase and generating phase  . 
One of further problems is to extend the grammatical data heuristically  , so as to intensify our machine translation system from learner's level to expert's level  . 
Though our system can translate fairly complex sentences  , it still commits learn-er's level errors when encountering difficulties such as ambiguity of prepositional group modification or of word linking scope for conjunction  . Heuristic aspects of semantics are also our current interests of research  . Especially the case-grammetical idea \[9\] seems to be useful to refine our syntactic-role assignment process so as to improve the quality of generated Japanese sentences  . A kind of semantic odesystem ( or thesaurus ) will also be required to be introduced in our lexicons  . Space limitation of this proceeding does not allow us to des-cribe Our linguistic model : HPM in detail  . We are planning to present he more detailed version of HPM together with later improvement in some appropriate journals  .
