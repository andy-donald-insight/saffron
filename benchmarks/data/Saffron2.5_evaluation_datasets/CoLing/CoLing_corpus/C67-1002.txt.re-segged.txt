The machine translation project at the Nat ional Physical Laboratory  ( NFL ) hasb?enterminated . It has always ha ~ as its prime a ima demonst rat ~ n of the practicability of transla tion by computer of Russian scientific texts into En@lish  . In order to test how farth is aim has been fu l filled and further  , to provide evidence to 6~i~e a potential agency intereste ~ in givin ~ a machine translation service  , we he . carried out an evaluation experiment on our translations  , the conditions of which as far as possible emulated those of a translations service  . 
The results of this experiment are presented in this paper  , together with a statuary of the translation methods used  . The paper as a whole will thus give an independent presentation of " what methods produced what results "  . For a comprehensive account of the NFL translation techniques  , see reference I . 
Evaluation of Translations
We have been concerned with the translation of scientific Russian texts only  . In considering how we might evaluate the results of our work  , the context of use of scientific translations imposed two main constraints  . Thus , firstly , in the vast m~jority of cases we woul ~ expect readers of translations to be themselves experts in the subject matter of the material translated  , i . e . they would be reading the translations because these reflect their main professional responsibilities  . We may then expect that the inherent background knowledge of such readers will ensure a hiKh impetus to their comprehension of translations and help them through syntactic awkwardnesses and multiple-meshing choices  . We would also expect that only a small peroenta6e of these readers would have any competence in Russian  . Secondly , the items of translation being read by the above typical readers will normally be whole in for  . ~ tion units ( journal article , chapter of book , abstract , review , & c . ) , and they will have the freedom to ignore unimportant sections of such units an & to use sentence or paragraph context  ( or even remoter references ) to help elucidate obscure sections . More specifically , a particular sentence may be poorly translate ~ , but because the reader can see that this is not an important sentence or because the context of  ( hopef Ully , better-translated ) neighbour in 6 sentences clarifies its meaning , that sentence may not affect at all an adequate comprehension of the whole  . 
Both these constraints are reflected in our evaluation experiment  . We ensured that our evaluators were expert in the-I-field of the material they were evaluating  , and also that they commented on the adequacy of an information unit as a whole  , not on individual sentences . 
We have included in this paper ( FI ~ .  2 ( A ) ) a shor t passage from one of the eva luated t ranslations  , as the full translation is inappropriate for this printed version  . However , the full translation will be availab lefor inspection at the presentation of the paper  , or the full translation of another paper can be examined in reference  1  , 
The evaluation experiment
In order to fulfil the first constrain t above  , we invited practising scientists to send in Russian papers  , reflect i ~ their professional special ity and preferably in the fields of general physics  , electronics , or electrical engineering . Some papers resulted from direct invitat ion  , others resulted from an open invitation published in our house journal  , " NFL Quarterly " . We undertook to send them the machine translat ions of their papers in return for their comments on how useful the results were  . We also obtained second opinions from other specialists in the subjects 
COncerlle ~
These evaluators were therefore as far as possible typical of the " customers " of a production MT service  ; in particular they had a personal interest in the subject matter and usually little if any knowledge of Russian  . 
In all ~ O+papers were received in responce to our invitation  ; of these 28 were transl~ted in full I .   3even of these were disregarded for various reason c 2  , and the remaining 21 were included in the evaluation . 
3 8 comments were received on 19 of these 21 papers . Of these two were rejected for vagueness , az ~ three brief comments from one group were treated as one  , so in all the experiment produced 3@ comments on 19 papers . 
1The other t6 are accounted for as follows : I was on a remote subject  ;   2 were deferred since we had already translated three papers for the same ' customer '  ; @ were with drawn ; 3 were translated only in part ; and 6 were not reached by the date our computer was sorapped ~  23 were on inappropriate subjects ; earlier version of the program ; for inclusion . 
2 were t rans la ted only by an and 2 were translated too late -2 -We had decided to give our evaluators a free han ~ in discussing the usefulness to them of translations of this quality  . 
This meant that a scale had to be devised by which their comments could then be graded by us  . A scale recently published in the U . S . A .   ( reference 2 ) was considered but not adopted since we felt that for our purposes more space should be given to the middle range of the scale  . The following wording was adopted ~ Fully adequate  . Meaning immediately clear , even though not always conventionally expressed . 
Mostly very good . A few sentences obscure , so that something essential may be lost , but normally clear enough . 
Fair . Takes a good deal of time to extract meaning and even then there is no great confidence in i t  , resulting in a partial understanding . 
Poor . Could only be useful to someone prepared to st ruggle hard  , and even he would often be disappointed . 
Useless . Although some semblance of meaning may appear occasionally  , it would never be worth the trouble of finding it . 
The wording of this scale is not derived on ar ~ scientific basis  , but it has proved useful in practice , since when four of uscame to grade the comments by it independently  , there was a good agreement between our markings . Our four individual ratings for each comment were reduced to a single rating  ( normally the mean ) after discussion . The range of scores is shown in FIG . I ; the mean score is 5 . 6 . 
The spread is no doubt due to a real variat ion in the quality of the translations combined with the prejudices and degrees of patience of the evaluators  . The lowest scores thus come from impatient professional translators dealing with a poorer -than-average text  , while the highest ones are perhaps over -enthusiastic supporters dealing with a better -than-average text  . 
The consensus though , is that there is a real demand for translations of this quality  , and this result provides , we feel , ample justification formounting a broader evaluation exercise  , over a wider range of potential readers of such translations  , to strengthen , if possible , this verdict and make it possible to-3-FIG . 1 Assessment of usefulness of N .

Evaluators '_ criticisms
Apart from the opinions as to the general usefulness of translation  , evaluaters '' comments contained ma~yparti cular points of criticism which ~ eserve discussion  . We are able to comment ourselves on some of these points from the position of having done considerable a evelopment work  , just short of full implementation , on techniques designed to overcome the particu lar translation faults  . Yull details of this further work are given in reference  1  , an & specific points of reference are given below  . 
Most of these criticisms can be classified into three groups  , concerning respectively : ( i ) the English equivalents offere ~ ( ii ) the syntactic resolution and ( iii ) the wor@order . 
A frequent criticism concerned missing or inappropriate equivalents  . In addition to fully justified remarks of this kind there were also cases in which the meaning proposed  , or pre-ferre ~ by there a ~ er , was uncommon . Its absence from the dictionary was the result of a preferential choice having been made  , a compromise between completeness and simplicity . The other alternative , including all possible equivalents , would of course drastically impair readability . The particular solution is often very difficult and can only be achieved to a satisfactory degree after lon~experience  . 
In otheroases there is no obvious preference an & the problem is further aggravated by the very high frequency of occurrence of the word  . Here belong some special classes , for example all prepositions and some very common words such as w  , a , an ~ ~ ro . Prepositions can and should be resolved by considering them together with either the governin ~ word or the governed com-plems nt  ( nominal or otherwise ) 1 . ( For example , yBe~T ~ .   . ~ a . ., ' to increase . . . . by . . . . ' ) . For the awkward common words specific syntactic subroutines should be devised ~ in practical ~ y all cases the solution is unique  ( see reference ~ )  . 
Only two evaluators complained about the necessi ty of selection among two or three equiva lents  . This is a matter of preference , but it seems to us that for a bonal ids reader an additional possibility of meaning  ( if it is not carried too far ) is more an asset than a disadvantage , even if it impairs to some 1On the lines already used for the reoo~mition of idioms  , expanded to include nonadjacent words ; see below in the summary of methods . 
-5-extent smooth reading I . Until a semantic analysis can be achieved , multiple equivalents are bound to stay in M ~ . 
A minor point , but nevertheless worth attention , was to the effect that when multiple equivalents followed each other  , the difficulty in understanding increased out of proportion  . For example , c~yqaeTcNnt ~ appears as : ' occurs in ' when the results with actual meaning is often ' results in '  . This was undoubtedly a real problem , which could perhaps be helped by using a longer space between sets of multiple equivalents in the output  . 
Complaints concerning un-idiomatic translations ( e . g . ' period of work ' instead of ' lifetime ' ) would be allayed by more work spent on our idiom list  , which contained only about 5@0 items , whereas 1 , 500 would be a more realistic figure . 
Complaints about inadequate syntactic analysis , leadimg to obscurities , ambiguities , and wrong resolutions , would have been considerably reduce & by a full implementation of the syntactic routines described in reference I  . One of the minor but annoying ambiguities , which ha ~ been resolved theoretically , but only partially implemented , was that of adver~short adjective . 
Order of clause components was a frequent subject of criticism  ; of course they can be rearranged according to the English usage only after a complete analysis has been made  . 
Among other things criticized was an inadequate treatment of abbreviations and abbreviated units  , some of which we recover@d by dictionary entries , while others were not , and this led to some misunderstandiu ~ s . Obviously this again is a matter for a more complete dictionary '  . The most difficult case is " nonce " abbreviations  ( we met , for instance , He ~ Tp . for He ~ TpO~HN ~ and produced ' non-itr . ' , which helped no one ' ) Here we seen oprospect of a solution . 
Our " anglicizing " routine was criticized ( while appreciating the general idea ) for unorthodox transliteration , which made it more difficult to identify the word in a standard dictionary  , if necessary 3 . A partial solution may be to exclude certain word  1Much can be said on this point . Reads rs , no a oubt , will realise how avelvet smoothness of t ranslation may hide ready agrievous fault  . 
~ i thafe w exceptions , however . Thus ' B ' may be very trouble-some , as regards the choice between the preposition and the abbreviated unit  ( " volt " )  , without a special syntactic subroutine . 
3This criticism clearly implied some knowle~e of Russian  . 
-6-classes , e . g . a cror~ymic abbreviations , which are obviously not suitable objects for the routine  ( they can be automatically reoo~xized as clusters of capital letters  )  . Also , in our prefix-recognizing routine there i saninherent & anger that a " not-in-dict ionary " word may have a part of the stem ident ical with an accepted prefix  . This applies in particular to short pre fixes  , like He- , in the above example of He ~ Tp .   . There is no general way of dealing with such words  . The best solution , in respect of both routines , seems to be , however , to include in the output both the original ( in Cyrillic , if possible ) and the synthetic equivalent for all " not -in-dictionary " words  . 
A few comments contained bouquets rather than brick bats  . 
One evaluator commented that the translation became easier to read as he got used to the unusual ' style '  ; and another found an instance whereas lip in the published human translation had reversed the intended meaning  ; our version of the passag ~ while not perfect by ar ~ means  , was certainly not misleading in this way . 
Finally , several evaluators commented that machine t rans-lations would need to show advantages in cost and speed over human translations in o rder for them to be attractive as well as acceptable  , and these are indeed criteria that we would ourselves put forward without fear of contrad iction  . V ~ e have not included a studs of cost and speed within this evaluation experiment  , as we do not have the market data to prepare at ranslation service specification that we could then refer such a study to  . However it is evident that our machine equiva lent of the human translator i  . e . input punch in ~ machiue translation and output printing ~ ith no human post-editor  ) will show a clear advantage on both these points . It would be essential to fit this component , though , into an overall translation system which was specified carefully to fit the translation market  .

-9-basis , in which each entry contains a Russian stem together with a coded list of suffixes which can combine with the stem  . 
This gave far fewer entries than would have been found in a fullform dictionary covering the same words  . Each entry contains grammatical ~ at a and English equivalents of the Rus~ian ~ The stem and suffix organisation ~ eman & e ~ that we create a system of splitting Russian words consistently into stem an ~ suffix  , fullydssoribed in Davies & Day ,  (1961) . The split is made at the point determined by the maximum number of letters which together form a Russian suffix or string of suffixes  . 
The maximum split technique sometimes causes too mar ~ letters to be treated as part of the suffix  , in other words , the split is made too early in the worm . Such words are provided with a cress-reference dictionary entry which directs the search to an entry in which the full information for the word is contained ~ The dictionary is recorded on two reels of  ma6netio tape , the entries being arra ~6e & in alphabetical ords r . Time of consultation of the fulld/otionary is from  12 minutes upwards , depending on the number of entries being sought . 
A text for translation is first punched on cards by an operator who reco~mizes Cyrill ic characters  , though she cannot read Russian . Symbols , punctuation marks and Cyrillic characters are represented by one card column per character  . 
Provision is made for indloat in 6 . a space to be lef ~ in the text where an equation or group of symbols occurs  . These will be inserted in the translation by han  ~  . The cards are treated as a continuous medium , card boundaries being ignored ,  . By this means quite a long paper can he encoded on a relatively small number of punohed cards  . 
The text , now on cards , is fed into the computer . The first computing process gives a serial number to each text word and then splits the word into stem and suffix  . When all text words have been subjected to th is process  , they are then sorted into alphabetical order  . This is essential for optimum speed of lookup in our serially organised dictionary  . 
The next programme in the translation sequence  , the look-up programme , scans simultaneously through the dictionary and the sorted text  , seeking dictionary entries corresponding to the text words  . The programme allows for the occurrence of stem homographs and for the correct handling of c ross-reference entries  . The output of the programme ( which we call , following Harvard , the augmented text ) consists of the text words each with the relevant dictionary entries appended  . 
Having obtained a set of augmented text entries , the translation sequence then sorts these back to text order  , using the text serial number originally allocated to each text wor ~-  t0 - The result of this series of operations is a text in the original ordsrj with dictionary entries appended to all but a few of the items  . Symbols and punctuation marks do not , of course , have corresponding dictionary entries , and there may be words in the text which are not represented in the computer dictionary  . The latter are given special treatment in the syntactic routines and translation output  . 
Provision is made in the dictionary for the representation of idioms  , using a m~thod analogous to that used in a nord in ary dictionary  . A " keyword " is chosen in the idiom ( normally the least frequently occurr in 6 wor ~ )  , the idiom being represented in the dictionary entry of the keyword  . The representation includes a list of the component words of the idiom  , using which the presence of an idiomatic text word sequence can be detected before attempt in ~ any syntactic operations on the augmented text  . 
The dictionary entry including the idiom contains the preferred English equivalent  . The dictionary includes coding for 5A0 idioms . 
Words not represented in the dictionary are given special treatment  , as mentioned above . All text words which commence with one of a set of  137 Russian prefixes are looked up both with and without prefix  . If the prefixed form does not occur in the d/ c tionar ~  , but the unprefixed form is found , then the entry for the uuprefixed form is included in the augmented text  , coupled with an En61ish rendering of the Russian prefix . Despite this provision , some text words will not intersect with the dic tionary  . For these an attempt is made to determine part of speech  , case , number , etc .   , by an inspection of grammatical and derivat ional suffixes  . In the translation output the stem of the not -in-dictionary word is transliter a ted  ,   aJuain6 to anglicize as far as possible the original word  . A derivations/suffix is given its English equivalent in the output rendering  ; any prefix that was recognised is also given its English rendering  . 
Yrom an augmented text produced by the foregoing procedures it would be a simple mechanical process to achieve a word-for-word " trans lation "  . We felt this was not worthwhile , as the application of relatively simple rules of grammar and syntax greatly enhance intelligibility of such a product  . 
Russian Analysis Algorithm
In the first place we designed and implemented a system of noun blocking and a simple predicate analysis  . The results obtained were not by any means ideal  , but we were encouraged to extend and refine our syntactic processes  . In our first attempt the functions of Russian analysis and English synthesis were c losely interwoven  . As our syntactic procedures were extended to cover more features it became evident that it was essential to separate the functions of analysis and synthesis  . 
In order to make this possible the linguist i c model  , described-11-in Yates ( this conference ) was developed . The mo~el Permits the analysis routines to express the Russian syntax as far as necessary and facilitates a transformation to the o or respond tr ~ 
En 61 is h sentence structure.
The analysis routines operate in a succession cf passes through each sentence  , defined by major punctuation mark boundaries ( full stop , question mark and s'emi-c01o ~ The functions of the successive ~ sses areas follows:  1  . A preliminary pass which establishes from the augmented text the ' terminal element for each discrete member of the sentence  . Punctuation marks are indicated in the elements for preceding or fpllowing sentence  . items , ~ ccording to a set of formal rules .   .   .   .

3 . A pass which establishes links betwe'e nad jacent n ~ minal structures  ; the linked elements include genitive quali fiers and prepositional group qualifi ers  .

A pass which searches for " potential coord inating conjunctions and examines the sentence lements or struottwes separate ~ by such con junctions  , setting up coor ~ tuAte ~ roups where appropr iate o  50 A pass which creates s~nple preaicate struc tures  , searching for words with a verb role and l then locat  in6 adjacent sentence elements or structures " act in ~ as verb a ~ unct so  6  . A pass whose function is to examine the role of some of the more " difficult " words such as the verb  611T ~ and its inflected forms , a ~ d the person a ~/ possessive pronouns ere , e 6 an ~ MX ? A full description of these an a lysis routines is given in reference  1  . In the present paper we shall take a Russian sentence and note the effect of each analysi spass on it  . 
The Russian sentence reads :
Beam ! ~ epxmnwSpanm cTpel ma-wn a easm ? MeCT8   8811KCH ~SHK ~ o The first an a ~ sispass is not of particular interest in the present context  . Suffice it to say that a system of re ference addresses is setup which permits the  scannin6 o ? the sentence whilst its structure is in an inccmplete state  . 

The state of the sentence diagram after the secon & pass has been complete ~ is : -  .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .

One noun ~ roup has been for me & , of which the modifier is a coordinate group of adjectives  . Each adjective is marked as a member in the coordinate group  , which itself assumes the properties of an adjective  . 

The third analysis pass has the function of creat  in6 genitive and preposition a links . Only the former are concerned in our sample sentenoe : - 
Ee ~ HM ~ .   .   .   .   .   . Nb , C . & M ~-& ? qepHgM ~ m ~ pau ~

The second analysis pass ignored all conjunctions which di ~ not occur explicitly within simple noun groups  ( i . e . 
groups with a single noun as head ) . The fourth pass , however , seeks to join to existing noun groups any other nouns linke ~ by coordinat ~ conjunctions : -

In addition the pass groups together in coordinate groups any similar words joined by coordinating conjunctions  , whatever their part of speech . Intervening punctuation prevents the formation of coordinate groups  . The coordinate group , when formed , is given the grammatical significance of its component parts  . 

The fifth analysis pass has little ef feot on our sample sentence  . The plural , short form participle is the sidle " verb "member of its verb group x-

The fifth pass also has provision for negative and conditional predicates truotuz 'es  . 
The function of the sixth pass is to try an ~ resolve the roles of certain more "~ fficult " words  . ( No instances occur in the sample sentence ) . For example , if one of the ambiguous persons // possessive pronouns is encountere a  , ~ check is made to see whether the following sentence element is nominal  . ? If it is , then the pronoun is joined in the element as a modifier ~ and the pronoun is treated as possessive  . Forms of the verb 6HT ~? which were not covered by the provisions of p ~ ssfive  , ere also included in the sixth pass .
