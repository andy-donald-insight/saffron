A metric for assessing the e~mplemlty of mmmntic ( and pragmatic ) analysis in natural language processing is proposed as part of a general applied theory of linguistic semantics for NLP  . The theory is intended as a complete projection of linguistic semantics onto NLP and is designed assaexhaustive list of possible choices among strategies of aement l canalysis at each level  , from the word to the entire text . The alternatives are summarized in a chart , w~ch can be ccmpleted for each existing or projected MLP system  . The remaining components of the applied theory are also outlined  . 
i . Goal
The immediate goal of the paper is to explore the alternative choices in the analysis of meaning in naturalls a guage processing  ( I ~ P )  . Throughout the paper , semantics subsumes pragmatics . The mere an ~ itioes goal of the paper , however , is to layground for an appl ~ ed theory of ~ ti ~ for  ~2  ?~  ST/~2  )  . 
2. ~~ of ~ smmtics formmral
A L6TAxLP is a part of an applied ~ theory for natural ~ ngnage pmoeessing  ( ALT/NLP )  . The latter obviously includes other ccmponsats , most prominently syntaxs admorphology . The applied theory is the result of a projection of linguistic theory on totlm NIP plane or  , in other ten as , sa adaptation Of general linguistic theory specifically for l ~ P purposes  . 
2 . 1 . ~ t is Theo__q ?, Semantic The or Z . The modern concept of linguistic theory , developed primarily by Ch~sky (1965) , is that of a set of statements which i ) characterizes language as a cc~plex structures ad describe that structure tapdown  ,  2 ) underlies each description of a particular language and determines the format of such a description  . Semantic theory as part of linguistic theory determines semantic descriptiens  . Semantic descriptions assign mesaings to sentences  , and each meaning is a fonmal a logically deduced from the rules provided by seamntic theory ald utilized in the descr ~ tion  . A valid semantic description assigns each sentence these remeaning that the native speaker does  . 
The theoretical in adequacy of m/ch of contemporary linguistics may stem from Chomsky's ~ that the theory is one  . An alternative viow of ~ as the ex~sL~tive ~ of altenmatlves  , complete with the issues on which the alternatives differ and the consequences of each choice  , is s~ply indispensable for applications . 
2 . 2 . ~ Applications and NLP . A meaningful application of linguistics always deals with a problem which comes entirely from the area of application and not from linguistics  . Every ~ system requires the description of a natural language fragment  , often of a subls a guage . On the one hand , modem linguistics , with its emphasis on formality , would seem to be uniquely sadun precedentedly qualified to supply such a description  . On the other band , while every single fact about language the ~ P expert needs is out there in linguia ~ ics  , much of it is not easily ancessible . Descriptions posing as theories or theories posing as descriptions tend not to list all the necessary facts in anyway facilitating computer Jmpemsatation  ( see below )  . The only solution to the problem is to develop a ~   . m ~ omBtm ~ ~ p m demm ~ ~ k * mw ledg ~ onto NLP , which is what ALT/NLP is ellabout . 
2 . 3 . ~Theo ~, I:ALT/NLP . ALT/hLP deals with pretty much the same facts and phenomena of language as linguistics per se  . There are , however , eroaial differences . 
First , while both " pure " and " applied " theories are formal  , the nature of the fo~d/sm is differ ~ mt . Second , pure linguistic theory deals with a language as a whole while ALT/~LP deals with limited and relatively closed sublal gusges or language fragments  ( senRaak in 1971 ,  1974 , 1985b ; Kittredge and Lehrberger 1982) . 
Third , pure linguistic theory must ansure a complete and even coverage of everything in the texture of language  ; ALT/hLP analyze only as much as needed for the purposes of NLP and ignore all the linguistic informatis a that is superfluous for it  . Fourth , the ultimate criterion of validity for pure linguistic theory is the elusive explanatory adequacy  ; the ultimate criterion for ALT/h\[2 is whether ~ systems resulting from its application work  . 
Fifth , pure linguistic theory can afford not to pursue the issue once a method or a principle is established  . In ALT/hLP , everything should be dose explicitly to tlm very end  , and no eKtrapolatios is possible . And finally , pure linguistic t / ~ eory has to be concerned about the botm dary between linguistic and encyclopedic knowledge  , i . e . , between cur knowledge of language and our knowledge of the world  ( cf . Rask in 1985a ) . There may be no particular need to maintain this distinction in an hLP system  ( cf . Schenk et al .  1985 ) because the computer needs all the I~nds of available information for processing the data  . 
2 . 4 . ~ ~ II : ASLT/hLP . AS ~ , a pr~ection of lin~dsticmmm ~ ties onto NLY , is designed to serve all the various hip systems . Therefore , it is viewed sad setup as the e~m native list of possibilities for semantic m~lysls and de ~ ription available in linguistic semantics  . 
The intended use of A~T/NLP is to bring to the NiP ousta ~ er  , not necessarily knowledgeable in linguistics , the totality of what linguistics knows about meaning by i  ) listing ell the choices available at each level of sanmntic analysis  ,  2 ) determining causal connections among choices sad the propagation of constraints through the choice space  ,  3 ) assessing say existing NLP system as to the c ~lexity of its ssnantic equipments ad the possibilities of expanding it in the desired direction if necessary  , and 4 ) relating each chain of compatible choices to the practical needs and resources  . This paper deals almost ~ clusively with the first item on this agenda  . 
3. The ~ Scale of Semantic Analsy ~.
The scale proposed in this section is a list of choices available at each of the five levels of semantic m~slysis  corresl0cnding to the five meaningful linguistic entities pertinent to ELP-the word  , the ~ , the sentence , the and the text , or discourse . At each level , attention is paid to such dimensions as the cc ~ pleteneas and relative depth of analysis  . 
All the emsmples are taken from one paragraph ( I ) in Ul\]msa ( 1982:1-2 )  . The paragraph does not stand out in any sense except that it clearly belongs to the ccmputer sablanguage of IMglish  . 
(I ) ( i ) Data , such as the above , that is stored more or less pem ~ anently in ac ~ puterwete ~ madatabase  . 
( ii ) The software that allows one or m say persons to uses ad/or modify this data is a database mana ~ emanteros  )  . 
( iii ) A major role of the D~M8 is to allow tlm user to deal with the data in abstract terms  , rather than as the computer stores the data . 
( iv ) In this sense , the D~M Sacts as an interpreter for a hlgh-level programming language  , ideally allowing the user to specify what most be done  , with little or no attention on the user's part to the detailed algorithms or data representation used by the system  . 
( v ) However , in the case of a D\]IMS , there may be far less relationship between the data as ~ by the user and as stored in the computer  , than between , say , arrays as defined in a typical programming language and the representation of those arrays in memory  . 
338 3 . I . The Word . The asmantic descriptions of the words are usually stored in the dictionary of an NLP system  . ~ ematym ~ ~ t~w ~ level may be full ~~/ al . The analysisi ~ full if every word of the analyzed text is s~ppesed to have a non-~pty  ( i . e . , distinct from just the spelling ) entry in the dictionary . The analysis is partialifoalys a ~ e words must have an entry  . Thes , an analysis of ( li ) as a sequence of three keywords ( for instance , in automatic obstranting ) , as sho~n in (2) , is definitely partial . 
(2 ) DATA ~ DATAm ~ '1~ae ~mi ~ may be ~ tedortml ~ mlted . The analysis is unlimited if the meaning of tt ~ word needs to heutilized in its entirety  . The analysis is limited if , for the purpese ~ of a given NLP , it would suffice , for in state , to describe the words in ( 3 i ) as physical objects and the words in ( 3 ii ) asmental objects and omit all the other elements of tl ~ ir meanings  . 
(3) ( i ) penmen , operator , computer(ii ) data , database , algorithm ~ other version of limited analysis would be to analyze the meanings of the words to the point of distinguishing each word from any other word and no further  . Th~s , ! ~ erators nd ~ can be distinguished in terms of semantic description assh ~ nin  ( 4 )  . 
(4) ( i ) o_o_~erator : Physical Cbject , ~imate(ii)cca ~_te___Er:PlrfsicalObject , Inan/mate It is worth noting tl~t while person and ! ~ erator can be simJ/srlyd : Lstinguished along the lines of  ( 5 )  , they can no the disting td slmd in the computer sublanguage and are  , therefore , complete synonyms . In other words , person is the parent of ~ in English as a whole but not in this sublangs age  . 
(5) ( i ) person : hman(il ) operator : Hums n , Using Gadget ~* esm ~ lysi ~ can use a rammer of metheds  . The first and min ~ Llone seems to be the ~ approach  , e . g . , keyword analysis . Within this approach , words are assi@guad to certain semantic classes , represented by what is often called keywords or descriptors  , and this r ~ ains their only characteristic . In m are sophisticated versions , descriptors may he further m ~ categorized , i . e . , parent-child relations m~ong them , , , an be setup , and disti~a ~ y entries will then contain hielarchles of them  , e . g . . (6) . 
(6) data M~TPALOBJELT ( It 4PUT~-P/KAT ~
Second , a form of feature ( oreom\[x*~ntlal ) snalysis can be used . The rosin distinction between feature analysis and set members l~p is that  , in the fozmer , the features come from different hierarchies . Thus , for ( 6 ) to be an exsmple of feature analysis rather tlmn of descriptor analysis  , CQMP ~\] I~REIAT ~ D should not be a child of ME2~_AL OBJECT in the system . 
X 1 % ird , tiedicti ~ mry entries may be setup as ne two , \]~ . 
In lings ~ stic semantics , the concept of semantic field ( sea , for instsnce , Raskln 1983:31-2 ) corresponds to a primitive network . In a purenet wozk-besed approach , only actual words serve as the nodes - there are nonmta ~ ords or categor Jalma ~ ers  ( unlike in syntactical trees ) and no primes ( unlike in feature analysis )  . The netwonks may have weighted or tm weighted\] . inks ( edges ); they may also , or alternatively , be labeled or tm labeled . The number of labels may vary . The label scenal so he setup as the other kind of nodes  . 
Generally , the nodes caa be equal ( flat ) or unequal ( hierarchical )  . ~ Ims , redness may be setup as a node while ___ ~ is a slot of a physical object  , connected with the redness node by the link color . 
3 . 2 . The Clanse . The clause boundaries are obtained throught l ~ application of a syntactic parser  . The full/partial dimession at this level deals with whether every cl ~ ase of the sentence is armlyzed or some are omitted  , and the latter is not Jmp as slble . The unlimited/limited dimension deals with the detalization of the analysis along the various paraneters  ( see below )  . 
Decisions on both of the ( lims ~ io as may be predeteunined by those taken at the ~ rd level  . In general , the ~ ll/partial and unlimited/llmited dimensions become the more trivial and obvious the higher the level  . Accordingly , while fully reflected at each level ~ i the chart in  ( I0 )  , they will he hardly mentioned iu the subsequent subsections  . 
The most~mportent decision to nmke at the clause level is whether the ontput is structured or not  . The unstmctm-~will simply list tl ~ semantic characteristics of all the words in the alanse which have them  , in the order of their appear ~ mce . The only clanse-ralated in for . mtion in such a cs Sew Lll bet l~e class e boundaries  . 
The stm~t t ~ e d outl m ~? may he dependent on t ~ e natural language syntax of the clause or not  . The accepted terms are : semm~t ~ c ~ , * terpret at i ( n for s2 mt scticalls ~ dependent outputs , and semantic repre ~ tari ~ , , otherwise . In at ~ plcal semBntic representatic tl , a treelike structure , such as ( i0) ( of . 
Nirenherg et al 1985:233) , may he setup for clauses instead of tm/rre~lar syntactics trastures  , with the nodes and/or link labels being of a different nature  . 
event with its antsnts as in ( 7 ii ) should be an obvious possible cheice for the analysis of the clause  . The structures may be more or less distant from the syntactic str~ture  ( in any guise ) but the presence of just one semantic node or- more often-link \] a be \]  . would render them nonsyntactic . 
(7 )   ( i ) \[ data \] is stored ~ ) reorless peun an ently in the cc~uter ( ii ) store agent object t ~ , espace goal operator data elways con~uter maintain-dats base In  ( 7 ii )  . the deviations from syntactic structure abound and include most prominen C\[yi  ) different link labels , e . g . , goal ;  2 ) substitution of m ~ lengusge-deter~dned paraphrases  , e . g . , ~ for more or less pemanently ;  3 ) in fonmtion not contained in the clause as d supplied frcm the sublanguage knowledge base  , e . g . , L~--maintain-database . 
Whether information for the semantical analysis of the clause is supplied from ontside of the clause as well as from inside for its analysis or only from inside dete ~ ines whether the analysis is s~n ~- ? m pasitioms loreom p  ( ~itimal . 
Finally , the clause analysis may include or ~ clude supra propesitic nalinfomm ! iticn  . ~y proime iti ~ mlan mlys is will basically mml ~ ze the clause as a sentence  . 
Thus ,   ( 7 i ) w :\[ ll be analyzed without the square brsckets around da __  ~  , which signify that the word is the supplied antecedent for a proncadnal entity  ( that )  , S~mpro~sitlmmlys ~ J typically subsumes propesiticaal enalysis and adds to it the infonnation on the links of the clause with the other classes of its own and/or t ~ e adjacent sentences  . Thus , in the case of (7i ) , that sh~tld be related to data two clauses earlier end the nature of the l~nk should be described : synt ~: ! tically  , it is a relative clause ; ~ wever , a sement l c label , such as EXPANSION , would be much more in folmat J~e ( sea also below ) . 
3 . 3 . The Sentence . The first important phenomenon to consider at the sentence level is whether the sentence is represented as a claasald ~ cmmsesf cxt~tmu ~ or not  . If the sentence is not represented as such a structure  , it becomes simply a sequence of classessuited by syntactical dependency infomnatien  . ~m ha sequence will not be much distinct from a sequence of monoclauss l sentences  , e ~ ept that some of them will be e Eustered together  . If the clausal discourse structure is there , it will be probably presented as a graph with the clauses for nodes and relations between them for link labels  . Again , as in the case of the clause , the link labels may renge fron the syntactic ten ~sto semantic relations  . A more semantically informative structure , with semantic l : h ' ~ , labels , is illustrated in ( 8 ) for ( li ) : such as the above that is stored mere or less pe*~mnently in a ccmputer S~m~nticlink labels are often associated with nonsyntactic clauses being distinguished-thus  , such as the above is not a fullfledged syntactic clause  . 
L~ce clause analysis , sentence analysis may be ? ~ mpomitim ~ or m~p ~ iti ~ml  . There is much meresupraccmpesitional information available at this level than at the clause level  . The strpracompesitions l information is , of course , knowledge-based . It can include i ) semantic field information for words ( paradigmatic semantic infonmation )  , i . e . , that c__~ter in ( I ) is a machine or a mechanical device and that certain other words  , probably not in the sublanguage , are fellow members of the field ;  2 ) information on the relations of the sentence with the world or subworld  ( for a sublanguage )  , e . g . , for ( I ) , the meaning of each sentence is clarified if semantic analysis utilizes a rule about the subworld  , namely that a very mental object in the subworld is located in the computer memory  ; 3) speech act info~nation , i . e . , whether the sentence is an assertion , a question , ac ( ~ mendor any other possible value of the illocutionary-force variable  ( see ~ burg et al 1985:234 )  ;  4 ) informat J ~ nond ~ eI ~ of the sentence with other sentences  ( see then ~ t paragraph )  ; 5) given/new information , e . g . , that this data is given in ( lii ) ; 6) main clause infozmation . 
Information on the links of the sentence with other sentences includes connectives  , both explicit as , for instance , however in ( iv ) , aud implicit . This infomaties is crucial for establishing the discourse structure of the paragraph  ( see 3 . 4) . ~ chinfo ~ nation is used only in systems which acccm~0date ~trasent~mtial~nfommti~n and ignored by systems with emlusively ~ ntentiel info ~  . 
Finally , each sentence can be characterized as to the it expresses  . In a text bookex position llke ( i ) , the goal tends to benn no to nous-it is to convey information or to teach  , but in a narrative te ~ t with protagonists or in a dialogue  , goals can vary with each cue ( see Schank and
Abe/son 1977; Reichman 1985).
3 . 4 . The ~ . The semantic analysis of the paragraph may include its representation as a sent~mtiel ~ or not include it  . If there is no such representation , then similarly to sentence analysis , the paragraph will be treated s~mply as a linear sequence of sentences  . Otherwise , the paragraph may be represented an a graph with sentences for nudes and with relations between the sentences for label links  . No standard syntactical nomenclature is available for this level  . Using one simple semantic link label ,   ( I ) may be represented as ( 9 )  :  ( 9 )   ( li ) ~ p~sion ( lii ) ~ pansi~j ~ ansien ~ ~ ion ( liii )  ~  ( liv )  ~  ( Iv ) Because of the nature of ( i ) and of its sublengusge , the link shetwesn the sentences are much less diverse than in casual discourse - and this is good for ~ LP  . It is possible , end often adv is able to combine the clausal structures of the sentences end the sentent is lst ~ctures of the paragraph in one graph  , because frequently a clause J none sentence is linked to a clause in another rather than the whole sentence to the other  , and the resulting graph is mere informative . 
It is also important to decide at this level whether to develop per a graph  tnp4n eKtrae tien or not . For the fozmer optien , the paragraph can be summrlzed by creating a new sentence or  , alternatively , one of the emisting sentences is selected to " represent " the whole paragraph  . 
3 . 5 . The Text . The questions of parsgrs ~ structure and of teKtual t~p ~ ~ xtrscti~narise here s/milarly to paragraph analysis  . 
3404. AS~mantic Metric for NLP.

Each system of hLP can use ( i0 ) to chart out its own method of semantic analysis , both before and after its formulation , and to ccmp are itself with any other system ( the actual metric is derived from ( I0 ) by adding an obvious measure of distance )  . Naturally , there are few ~ pessib ~ e basic types of semsutic analysis in  h~2 than 3x2-'  >  5x10-  , simply because meny values in ( I0 ) determine others and render many c?~binatiess incompatible  . On the other hend , there are variations witl dn the besic types . 
The proposed metric is just one part of A~LT/M2 . The co , fete ASLT/SLP adds the following parts to the metric :  1  ) mutual determination and ~ clusion of values in ( 1O )  ; 2) choices for ~ ecutien of each value ;  3 ) relations between ~ LP needs aqd values and esmbinations of values  . 
Its lx~d d he noted that besides ensuring the total modularity of semantic moalys is in BLP by providing the full/partisland unllmited/limited values for each level  , this part of the theory is itself modular in the sense that any value or option  , which may have been left out in advertently or which may emerge in the future  , can be added to ( I0) without any problem .
