Abstract
Recent years have shown a surgein interest in temporal database systems  , which allow users to store time-dependent intbrmation  . We present a novel controlled natural anguage interface to temporal databases  , based on translating natural language questions into SQL/Telnporal  , a temporal database query language . The syntactic analysis is done using the Type -Logical Grammar framework  , highlighting its utility not ; only as a theoretical fralnew or k but also as a practical tool  . The semantic analysis is done using a novel theory of the semantics of temporal questions  , focusing on the role of temporal preposition phrases rather than the more traditional focus on tense and aspect  . Our translation method is considerably simpler than previous attempts in this direction  . We present a prototype software implementation . 
1 Introduction
Traditionally , database management systems were designed to store snapshot information  , valid at a particular moment of time ( state ) . 
I to we ver , many applications require handling dynamic time -dependent information  , pertaining not only to the present , but also to the past and future . Adding temporal support to databases has proved to be a surprisingly * This work was carried out as part of the research project " Semantics of Natural Language Temporal Questions and Interfaces to Temporal Database Systems " sponsored by the Fund for interdisciplinary researd l  , administered by the Israeli Academy of Science . We thank Michael B Shlen , Bob Carpenter and Andreas Steiner for each allowing us to incorporate their software within our own  . We also thank Yoad Winter and the anonymous referees for helpful comments on a previous version of this paper  . The work of the second author was partially supported by the fund for the promotion of l ' eseardl in the Tcchniou  . 
thorny issue ( Tanseletel . , 1993) . A recent drive to consolidate research efforts has led to the design of a consensus temporal data model and associated temporal database query language  , SQL/Temporal , an extension of the popular Structured Query Language  ( SQL )   ( Snodgrass ,  2000) . 1SQL/?J ) enlpora \] represents a significant improvement over standard SQL in allowing programmers to express temporal queries  ( Snodgrass ,  2000) . Since temporal database ( TI ) B ) implementations are still in their infancy ( Boehlen ,  1995) , there is little practical experience with SQL /Temporal  ; let alone experience of nonexpert users . However , it ; is our belief that such users are bound to find the expression of complex temporal queries in SQL /Temporal to be extremely difficult  . 
In an attempto counter this problem , we present a translation method from controlled natural anguage  ( NL ) to SQL/Temporal . Following the standard pipeline architecture of such methods  , translation is done via an intermediate meaning representation language illustrated in Figure  1  . NL questions are first parsed using a grammar in the Type Logical Grammar  ( TLG ) framework ( Carpenter , 1998; Mor-rill ,  1 . 998) . Simultaneously with parsing , the NL question is translated into a formula of a formal language called Lane  , ( Toman ,  11 . 996) , based on the interval operators of ( Allen ,  1983) . The translation is based on an independently motivated novel semantics of sentences modified by temporal Preposition Ph  , rases ( PPs ) ( Pratt and Francez 1997; 2000 , Nelken and Francez 1999) . 
The constructed LA no . formula is then trans-tThrough continued design , SQL/Temporal has evolved from predecessor versions named  TSQL2   ( Snod-grass ,  1 . 995) and ATSQL2 ( Boehlenetel . , 1996) . It is expected to be incorporated within the new version of 
SQL named SQL3.

We have implemented this method as a prototype software tool  , called QIYEI ~ TY ,   ( all nost ) an acronym lbr " Querying with 15'nglish , of l~cla-rio'hal Temporal Databases " . Parsing and trans-la . tion to I , Alle , , is done using the TLG Theorem Prover ( C ~ u : penter ,  1999) . The trml slation from \[' allen to SQL/Temporal is done using an adaptation of a temper a  . 1 logic(T i , ) to Aq'SQL2 translator of ( Boehlen et al ,  1996) . The result-lag query is submitted to a prototype TI  ) B implementation , calle(lTimel )\] ( Steiner ,  1)97) .

Much less work has been devoted to the design of Nil  , interfa . cestoTDBs(C'lifford , 1990; Hinrichs , 1988) or other computer sys-t ( . ' n ls involving a temporal dimension ( Crouch and l ) ulnm . n , 71993) .

3 The TDB
ATDB is a two-sorted tirst-oMer structure.
The domain consists of a Data Do'main , D , and a Temporal Domain of intervals ,  7'/ , detined as follows . Let Tp1)ea . set ( of time points ) with a discrete linear order without endl ) oints ,  < . _  . 7'1 is defined as the set of pairs : 7) = Z , ) la_<bcTu-oo , oo . ardational database schema is a set , of single-sorted predicate symbols ( H , 1 ,  . . . , l~k ) . Given a relational database schelnap , a Tl ) l schemap ' is the sol ; 3/ of two-sorted predicate sylnbols ( l ? 11 ,  . . . , \]~) , where the sort of /? ~ isDaritv(l~i)xTI . ATI ) 1 3 instance of schema f is a set of relations R\[C l  ) arity ( li ) X7 )  , where each R~is finite . 
For instance , assume a database schemap consistinger a single binary predicate symbol ' work  , storing l breacheln ployee the department ill which she is employed  . The Tl ) lschemap'consists of the relation wo'rk ' , called a valid-ti'm c state table , which adds a . temporal argu-nlent1; othe original relation , caJ led the valid-time of the table . '\[' he temporal argument can be used to store the history  ( and 1 ) erhaps even future plans ) of departments in which eml ) loyees are employed . Following a . suggestion of ( Androutsopoulos ,  1996) , we also include relation smal)l ) ing names of ca . lendricatiems to temporal intervals in p ' . For instance , we store a . relation year/ma . l ) l ) ing the year 2000 to the interval\[71 .  \] . 2(100-3 J .  12 . 2000\]  ( which in turn is nlappe ( t to an element of 7 ) ) . 
We now describe the translation process.
4 The translation process
The translation 1) recess a . c cepts input NL questions in a controlled subset of Nil  ,  . Restricting in l ) ut language in this way enables e\[l'ective processing of a sufficiently rich fragment while avoiding many of the well-know problems of unrestricted NI  ,  . We use a formal grammar in the TLG framework . Our grammar is specially designed for use with ~ particular TDB schema  . 
Future work will allow easier configuration of the grammar with respect o the schema  . 
Our grammar is based on work on all independently motivated theory of the semantics of telnt  ) orality . Most of the research in this tield ( see ( Steedman ,  1997 ) for a survey ) has rocllsed on the issues of tense a . nd aspect . \ ~ eha . nd le tense , but purposefully not aspect , which playsAspect , which is used to retlects peal ~ ers'temporal viewpoint with respector eported situations is animi  ) ortant facet of NL temporality . However , its relevance to TDBs is questionable , as it is unlikely that a realistic TDI3 would actually encode such subjective viewpoints . Moreover , handling aspect requires postulating a more complex data model  . For instance , ( Androutsopoulos ,  1996 ) augment stile TDB model with event-like " occurrence k lentifiers "  , and adds a . n additional argument to temt ) oral relations indicating whether a given event has cuhninated or not  . While such devices may perhaps be linguistically justified  , it is unclear whether the TDI3 community would adopt such augmentations of the model  . 
Instead , following ( Pratt and Vrancez , 2000; Nelken and Francez ,  1999 ) our focus is on sentences modified by temporal PPs  . These PPs are analyzed as variants of standard generalized quantifiers  ( Barwise and Cooper ,  1981) , in which qnantification is over : time . Using this framework , we handle questions that refer explicitly to the temporal  ( timension ( e . g . 
When/during which year .   .   .   ) as well as questions in which temporality is hnplied by the TI  ) B context ( e . g . Did Mary work in marketing ? , Which employees worked in marketing ?) . Weban-(lie both clausala . nd phrasal teml ) or a\]Pl ) s(e . g . 
after John worked in R&D , during every year ) . J\n important strength of this semantic theory is that it  ; allows for arbitrary iteration of PPs ( e . g . 
one month during every year until 1992) . In addition , our grammar also handles qua . ntific ~ tion over individuals ( e . g . some employee ), coordination and negation . 
input questions are parsed using a lexicalized type-logical grammar  . Lexical items are as s ( > elated with a syntactic ategory and a higher -order lambda-term representing its semantics  . 
Taking advantage of ' I'LG's elegantly tight coupling of syntax and semantics  , parsing and construction of a semantic representation i the form of an LAllen Ibrmula proceed silnult an e-on sly  , in a bottom-up fashion . \ ? e have found using TLG to be advantageous over a feature-structure based formalism  ( such as IIPSG as in ( Androutsopoulos ,  1996)) , since formula construction is an integral part of the l  ) arslng and does not require complex ad hoc manipulations of feature structures  . 
Using a particular grammar helps reduce some of the ambiguity inherent in unrestricted NL  . For instance , whereas in general a preposition such as at is ambiguous between a temporal and a locative interpretation  , the choice of the coml ) lement NP relative to a given schema-induced grammar deterministically fixes the interpretation  . As another example , whereas iterating several temporal PPs ( e . g . during some month every year ) opensup exponential seep-ing possibilities , some choices are eliminated by world knowledge , which is encoded in the grammar ( e . g . every year must have higher scope than some month since months are included in years and not vice versa  )  . In cases of remaining ambiguity , Cite user is presented with all Cite distinct possibilities  . Future work will allow the user : to lnalce informed choices between different possible readings  , e . g . by presenting him with NL l ) ara . phrases of the alternatives . 
\? e translate NI , questions into \] , All (' , , , - if ' i remain reason for : not translating directly to SQ l  , /Temporal is that the \] atter is not closed\[' or subformulae  , i . e . a subformula of a wellformed query is not necessarily wellformed  . 
Since LAne , " is closed for " subformulae , compositionally constructing formulae while parsing in a bottom-u  1  ) fashion becomes much easier . 
I , An ~, is defined as follows ( Toman , 1996).
I , etp be the database schema (1~, .   .   . , I~t , . ) . l , et:L::=/~,~(x,I ) ILALI~LI~x . LI~I . LIx = yllc ~ J where x , y are variables over D , x is a vector of such variables , l , J are varlet ) lo sor constants over T\] , and ( risone of the operators : precedes , meets , overlaps , equals , contains . LAlien is defined a stile set of '\[ brmulaepE L that con-Lain at most one free variable over TI  . The answer to a formula 90 relative to a TDBD is x , ll > ~ :( x ,  :) . 
To illustrate , consider the NL question : During which years did Mary work in marketing ?' File I  , Allen representation for " it is constructed in a bottom-up nla  , nnel ' . The meaning representation of the main clause Mary worked in marketing is constructed as:
