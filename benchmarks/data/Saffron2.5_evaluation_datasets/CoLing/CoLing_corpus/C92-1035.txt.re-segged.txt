1 Introduction
A categorial semantics for Lexical-khmctional Grammar provides a means for semantic interpretation of sentences of natural language that is appropriately constrained both syntactically and semantically  . The f-structure of LFG provides across -lingnistically uniform format for representing syntactic information  ; constraining a derivation with respect othef -structure rather than a phrase structure tree allows reference to relevant functional syntactic information without requiring construction of a phrase structure tree whose form is  ( often dubiously ) motivated on semantic grounds . Additionally , a categorial semantics constrain semantic derivations appropriately  , obviating the need for an appeal to wellformedness conditions on the resulting semantic representation  . 
2 Previous Work
Most semantic analyses appeal to syntactic on -straints on semantic derivations  . In particular , many analyses assume that such syntactic on -straints are statable in terms of phrase structure tree configurations  ( Montague ,  1974) . However , it is wellknown that a variety of phrase structure configurations can express the same syntactic predicate-argunlent relations within and across languages  ( Kaplan and Bresnan , 1982); thus , syntactic constraints on semantic derivations are better expressed at a level at which the relevant syntactic information is expressed more uniformly  . Such a level is the f-structure of LFG . 
Halvorsen ( 1983 ) first provided a theory of semantic interpretation for LFG in which semantic interpretation rules are related to the f -structure  . His system involves an intermediate level of representation  , the ' semantic structure ' , which is represented as a directed graph like the f-structure  )  . Translation rules map from fstructures to semantic structures  , and these structures are then interpreted ( or translated into a formula of intensional logic )  . 
The approach to be presented here also relies on f -structure configurations to provide syntactic constraints on categorial semantic derivations  . However , an intermediatelvel of semantic representation such as Halvorsen'se-mantic structure is not introduced  . In the cat-egoriai semantic framework developed by Fernando Pereira  ( Pereira , 1990; Pereira and Pollack , 1991; Pereira ,  1991) , syntactic structures are directly associated with interpretations  ( or their types )  , and syntactic on figurations license the combination of these interpretations in a semantic derivation  . On this approach , ' logical forms ' are not viewed as manipulable syntactic objects  ; instead , a logical formula is simply a graphical representation fame aning that is lexically provided or that is the outcome of a semantically justified derivation  . In this , the approach differs from other recent approaches to semantic interpretation iLFG  ( Halvorsen and Kaplan ,  1988) , in which the interpretation of an f-structure is represented as a directed graph  , and semantic derivation proceeds principally by unification of semantic representations  . As a consequence , these approaches require constraints on semantic derivations to be stated as wellformedness conditions on semantic representations  , contrary to the commonly-held goal of dis -pensabihty of logical form  . 
To illustrate a categorial semantic analysis within LFG  , I will provide a small fragment of syntactic and semantic rules of English  ; the fragment contains rules for quantified noun phrases  , nominal modification , and clauses headed by transitive and intransitive verbs  . Many of these rules are modifications and extensions of rules originally described in Pereira  ( 1990 )  , though Pereira ' s system appeals to phrase structure configurations rather than fstructures to con-ACRESDE  COLING-92  .

3 Sentence Interpretation
A sentence such as ( 1 ) has the interpretation given in ( 2 ) : 1  ( 1 ) John crashed . 
(2) crash(john )
This interpretation is the outcome of a deriva-t ion according to a set of rules to be described below  . Some of the rules must be licensed by particular f-structure configurations  , while some are unrestricted in their apph cahihty  . Example 1 has the following h structure : ( 3 ) \[ PRED , crash ( SUBJ ) ,   1 \[ SkrBJ\[PRED'John'\]\]Annotated phrase structure rules hkethe following are assumed :  2 
S ---, NP VP ( TsuBJ ) = ~1-
VP-~V ( NP)
T = ~( ToB ~) = l
Notice that these phrase structure rules encode only syntactic information  . No semantic infor-mation or constraints are required  . 
The lexical entries involved in the derivation of sentence  ( 1 ) are:
John NP ( IPRED ) = ' John '
I ~=\[ OP/\]crashed V ( TPILED ) = ' crash ( suBJ' (  , TENSE ) = PAST(TPRED ) a:\[O\[-Ax . crash(z )\] The notation f ~ , stands for the interpretation of an f-structure f  , often referred to as the se-mantic projection of f  ( Kaplan , 1987; Halvorsen and Kaplan ,  1988) . The interpretation for any f-structure f is a sequent :  1I will ignore tense and aspect in the representation fsentence meanings  . 
2See Bresnan ( 1982 ) for an explication of the relation between c -structure and f-structure and the notation commonly used to represent that relation  . 
(4) G:\[o~-M\]
The sequent '\[ a ~ M\]' is a pair consisting of a set of assumptions a  , somewhat analogous to a ' quantifier store ' ( Cooper ,  1983) , and a ma-trixterm M in which free variables introduced by the asstutlptions in a may occur  ( Pereira , 1990; Pereira , 1991; Dalrymple et al ,  1991) . In the following , I will speak of such expressions as introducing the meaning M under the assumptions in a  . 
I assume a fixed order of application of the meaning of a verb to its semantic arguments  , with the order determined by the syntax ( though this assmnption is not crucial to the analysis  )  . 
Arguments are applied in the following order : s ( 1 ) Obliques ( 2 ) o , ~2  ( 3 ) os J ( 4 ) sun J The PILED of the f-structure of an active verb such as own will  , then , be associated via the a mapping with the following interpretation :  ( 5 ) A y . Ax . own(x , y ) Notice that the verb is required to combine with the object first  , and then the subject , in accordance with the argument ordering given above  . 
\]:' or a passive verb , the ordering will be reversed . 
For the passive verb ( be ) owned , the order will be : (6) x ~ . ~v . ow , t(~ , v ) Here , the verb combines first with the oblique by -phrase  , then with the subject . 
The rule for interpreting art f-structure for a clause headed by an intransitive verb is:  4   ( 7 ) Clause with intransitive verb : 3This order of application was also proposed by Dowry ( 1982 )  , and is reminiscent of the obliqueness ordering for arguments in HPSG  ( Pollard and Sag ,  1987) . 
4This rule should apply when f has a PRED and a sUB J  , but no other governable grammatical functions ; it should not apply if the verb is transitive and there is a slJl ~ J and an  oB3  , although f is unifiable with tilef-structure of a transitive verb as well as an intransitive one  . There are several ways of ensuring the needed result : the valence of tire verb can be reflected in its semantic type  ; fstructures can be typed , with this rule applying only to intransitive fstructures  ( Zajac and Emele ,  1990) ; or the PROD and its arguments can be separately specified  , with the argu-marts of the PRED specified as a list which can be mnt ched against  , as in recent work by John Maxwell , Ron Kaplan , and others .

S  ~ , =\[ as ~- ms\]f , , = \[ ap U as ~- mv ( ms ) \] The derivation of the meaning f ~ of an f -structure f with a PRED and SUBJ proceeds by applying the meaning of the PILED to the meaning of the suBJ  . The associated assumption set is the union of the assmnptions from the PRED and the SUna  . The f-structure for sentence 1 h censes the following derivation and provides the expected meaning  ( under a null assumption set ) :  ( 8 ) \[' pRED f2: , craah ( SUBJ ) , Jks . ., ' John'\]\]
Lexically specified meanings : ( f ~) ~=\[0~-Ax . crash(~\](fa ), ~--\[0~-j\]
By rule 7: ( fl ) ~=\[0 U0l-Ax . erash ( x )   ( j ) \]=\[0-crash ( j )  \ ]  4 Quantification Sentence 9 contains a quantified noun phrase and has the meaning represented in  ( 10 ) :  ( 9 ) Every car crashed . 
(10) every ( Ay . car(y ), Az . craMz(x ))
This sentence has the f-structure shown in (11) , constructed on the basis of the lexical entries below :  ( 11 ) \[ Pa~D'c~ash<sv . J )'\]
SPECLPRED ' every '
LLPRgD'car'JJ every DET ( TPREP ) = ' every '
T~=\[0~-every\]carN(TPRZ . ) =' car'(TP ~ ZD ) ~=\[0 ~ ay . ear ( y ) \] The type of the quantifier every is the familiar generalized quantifier type  ( e-+t )  ~  ( e~t ) ---* t : quantifiers are functions from properties to properties  , yielding a truth value . The following schematic rule is necessary to interpret quantified noun phrases :  ( 12 ) Quantified noun phrase , preliminary version ( handles unmodified nominals only ) : f\[svzcS\]\]:\[PriEDP\]
S~=\[as~-ms\]I
P , = lapF-me\]f ~-\[ as\[5ap , quant(ms , x , rap ) ~-2\] The notation ' a , A ' represent shese taplus the singleton A . By this rule , a quant assumption is added to the assumption set for the noun phrase  . 
The quant assmnption acts like an element in a Cooper store  , keeping together the information associated with the quantified noun phrase  , ms in the quant asstmlption is the meaning of the specifier  ( here , every ) ; z is the variable introduced by the quantifier as the meaning of the quantified norm phrase  ; and mp is the meaning of the PRED , which will form the first argument of the generalized quantifier every when quantifier discharge takes place  . The derivation of the meaning of sentence 9 according to the rnles given thus far proceeds as follows : fl:SPEC  f4 : PROD ' every ~
SUBJ f3:LPRE pf5:'car'
Lexically specified meanings : ( f2L = \[0 WA ~ . crash(z/\]
By rule 12 , ' Quantified noun phrase ': ( In ) , =\[ quant ( every , z , A y . car(y )) Wz\]By rule 7 , ' Clause with intransitive verb ': ( kL-\[q ~ ant (  , ~ ery , , , ~ y . ear(y )) ~ cry*h( , )\] According to these rules , the meaningfor f-structure fl is a meaning under an assumption about the variable x  . The meaning of fl without assumptions i obtained by discharging the  ( sole ) quantifier assumption in the assumption set . The quantifier discharge rule relates a sequent and a syntactic licensing environment to a new sequent : Acres DE  COLING-92  , NANT ~ . 2328^O ~"1992214 PROC . OFCOLING-92, NANTES , AUG .  2328 , 1992 (14) Quantifier discharge : disch(f , \[ a , quaut(ms , x , mR ) ~- SCOPE:t\]) =\ [ a~ms"(rap , Ax . SCOPE)\]
Conditions on f:none
By this discharge rule , the quant assumption is removed from the assumption set  , the variable x introduced by the quantifier assmnption is abstracted out of the scope SCOPE  ( required to be of type t )  , and the quantifier is applied to its scope . The syntactic licensing environment is the f -structure f  . in this rule , fislmeons trained ; there are no conditions on f . This means that the quantifier discharge rule has art unrestricted syntactic licensing condition  . A quantifier may scope over any syntactic on stituent  , as long as it is of the correct semantic type . 5 To interpret sentence 9 , dise h can now be applied to the sequent ( fl ) ~ associated with the f-structure \]1: disch ( ? , \[quant ( every ,  ~ , ) ~ y . car(y )) bcrash(z:)\])=\[0\]-every(Xy . car(y ), Xx . crash ( x ) )\] The result is the meaning of fl with all assumptions discharged  . I will assume that what is generally referred to as the ' meaning ' of an utterance is the meazfing obtained when all assumptions have been discharged  . 
In general , assumptions may be discharged after any application of a functor to an argument  , as long as the syntactic enviromnent for assumption discharge has been met  . Thus , a predicate apply can be defined : (15) apply ( f , \[ a~~F un\] , \[ aA ~ Arg\]) d9 discharge(I , \[ aFUaA'-Fun ( Avg ) \] ) apply operates on sequents in a syntactic licensing environment f  . discharge(f , S ) is the result of applying any number of discharge  ( disch ) rules licensed by the syntactic on figuration f to S  . ( Note that apply is not a function , since the result of apply depends on the Immber and the choice of assumptions to be discharged  . ) By this function application rule for sequents , then , the meaning of the fimctor is applied to the meaning of the argunlent  ; the union of the functor assumptions and the argmnent assumptions i taken  ; and some number of discharge rules may be applied  . This definition of apply will be used ~ Here\[ will not discuss conditions on preferred scopes for quantifiers  ( uc has the tendency for the quantifier each to outscope other quantifiers  , or for quantifiers to scope inside the clause in which they appear  )  .

Given this new definition of apply , interpretation rule 7 for clauses headed by intransitive verbs can be restated :  ( 16 ) Clause with intransitive verb : The interpretation for an f-structure f  , representing an umnodified clause with an intransitive verb  , is obtained by applying the pREI ) P to the SuBJS in the syntactic heensing enviroltment f  . 
In general , f  ~ , will constitute an assignment off to a sequent hat satisfies the constraints given by the lexical entries and the rules of interpretation  . 
It should be noted that rule 16 is incomplete in providing interpretations only for sentences not involving adverbial modification  ; an analysis of adverbials , though straightforward in this framework , will not be provided here . 
5 Nominal modification
Rule 12 for tile interpretation fquantified norm plL rases is incomplete  , since it apphes only to unmodified nominals . Consider sentence (17) , its f-structure , displayed in Figure 1 , and its meaning , (18): (17) Every car that John owned crashed . 
(18) ~ ery(~ . ea ~( ~) Aow,~(j , ~), ~ y . cra~h(y ))
These lexical entries are necessary : that CMP ( \[ PRED ) : PRO ( TTYPE ) = RELownedV ( ~ PRED ) :-'own ( SUBJ , OnJ)'(l'r ENSF~)"PAST(1P ~ ED) .  = \[0 ~- @ . a  ~ . own(~ , y ) l Syntactically , a relative clause contains a fronted constituent ( a TOPIC ; see Bresnan and Mchombo ( 1987 ) ) which is related to a gapped position in tim sentence  . This fronted constituent contains a relative pronoun or that  . Tile relative pronoun nlay be deeply embedded in the fronted PROC  . ol , COLING-92, NANTES , AUG .  2328 , 1992 constituent , as in the ease of pied piping . Semantically , the interpretation of a relative clause is the property obtained when the position filled by the relative pronoun is abstracted out  . For example , here are some relative clauses with a rough representation f their memfings :  ( 19 ) a . ( the man ) that I saw : A z . saw(1, ~) b . ( the man ) whose brother'searI drove:
A ~. drove(I,z's brother's car)
I assume that relative pronouns such as that or whose introduce a variable underatel assumption which is abstracted out in the course of the derivation  . The interpretation of a relative clause is obtained by a rule allowing the discharge of the rel assumption associated with the relative pronoun  ( and possibly other assumptions as well ) :  ( 20 ) Relative clause interpretation :\[ TOPICTOP\] f :\[ RELRJ ~" f ~= discharge  ( f , R  ~ ) The teld is chargerule applies only under syntactically licensed conditions :  ( 21 ) Relative clause assumption discharge : disch ( f , \[ aREL , tel(x ) ~ REL:t\])=\[aREL~-Az . RELl
Conditions :\[ TOPICTOP\]f:\[RELR\] ( /TOPICGF * ) = relp:\[PREDTypEaLJPRO\] , elp ~=\[ , el ( x ) ~ x : e The relative pronoun must appear in the fronted TOPIC constituent  . This is indicated in the second condition by the regular expression TOPICOF *  ; this expression involves functional uncertainty ( Kaplan and Maxwell ,  1988 ) and requires that the relative pronoun relp must appear at the end of a path that is a member of the language described by the regular expres - tmn  . Here , the path expression does not constrain where the relative pronoun may be found within the fronted constituent  ( OF * is a sequence of zero or more grammatical functions  )  ; a more complete syntactic analysis of relative clauses would constrain the path appropriately  . The result of the application of rule 21 is that the variable introduced by the relative pronoun is abstracted out  . 
The value of the MOPS attribute is a set off -structures  , interpreted according to the following rule : ( 22 ) The semantic value of a set off-structures is the set of corresponding sequents  . If F is a set of fstructures :
F ~ -- f ~ r f c F
The rule for the interpretation of quantified noun phrases with nominal modification is given in Figure  2  . According to this rule , the derivation of the meaning of a quantified noun phrase proceeds by introducing a variable  ( x in Figure 2 ) under a quant assumption , consisting of the meaning of the specifier of the noun phrase  , the variable , and the quantifie restriction ILEST . 
Recall the definition of apply given in 15: ( 23 ) apply ( f , jaR~-Fun\] , \[ aAF-Arg \]) d ~= y discharge(f , \[ aFUaA ~- Fun ( Arg ) ) This definition will now be extended so apply can take a set ofsequents as its argument  . The result is a set of sequents : (24) apply ( f , Set , Arg ) dffs\[FunESetAs = apply(f , Fun , Arg ) The function conj is defined as the conjunction of a set of sequents  ; the matrices of the sequents are conjoined and the union of the assumptions is taken :  ( 25 ) conj ( S ) de=/\[UaF-AM\]
I a P-M\]e S\[a~-M\]ES nEST , then , is the conjunction of the result of applying the PRED meaning and the meaning of each of the modifiers in MOPS to the variable z  . 
Finally , a rule for the interpretation of a clause containing a transitive verb is also needed :  ( 26 ) Clause with transitive verb : ??: lf:SUBJ
OBJO f ~ = apply(f , apply ( f , P  ~ , O ~) , S  ~ ) The interpretation of sentence 17 can now be derived ; the derivation is sketched in Figure 3 .

NANTES , AUG .  2328 ,   1992   6 Conclusion The small fragment of English presented above is easily extensible to handle other semantic phenomena  , such as sentential modification . Constraining semantic derivations with respect o fstructures i preferable to the standard approach of using phrase structure trees  , since fstructures need not be specifically tailored to solving the interpretation problem  , but are motivated on independent grounds . The categorial semantics rules presented above provide an interpretation for fstructures directly  , without the need for constructing an intermediate lvel of ' logical form '  .
