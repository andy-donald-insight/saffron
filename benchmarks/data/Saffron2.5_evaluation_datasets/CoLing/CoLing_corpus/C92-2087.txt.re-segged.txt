We are studying how to extract hierarchical relation on verbs from definition sentences in a Japanese dictionary  . The hierarchical relation on verbs has been dealt with as a binary relation on verbs  , but it should be dealt with as logical relation on predicates  . We will define the logical form of the hierarchical relation on verbs and then discuss which part of the syntactic structure of the definition sentence represents that relation  . We will call the main predicate verb in this part the definition verb  . Furthermore we will describe how to semiautomatically select he proper meaning of the definition verb and the proper correspondence b tween cases of an entry verb and the definition verb in order to extract the hierarchical relation as logical relation  . 
1 Introduction
The syntactic processing has been playing the main role in a natural anguage processing system  . But we have come to know that we can't construct a practical system with only this processing and that the semantic processing is necessary for it  . Inference plays an important role in the semantic processing  , we therefore need a large knowledge base about meaning of words and we must treat it as logical relation  . 
Hierarchical relation between words is inevitable and transitive  , and it is a important relation in the large knowledge base  . Because inevitable relation holds at any time and the reliability of conclusions inferred from it doesn't fall down and transitive relation can be described efficiently  . 
There were some researches on extracting the hierarchical relation between words from definition sentences in a ordinary  dictionary\[I\]\[2\]\[3\]\[4 l . 
But they treated it as only binary relation between words  . Verbs correspond to nary predicates on entities and we therefore must describe the correspondence bt ween the variables  ( that is case or syntactic role ) of a subordinate verb and ones of its superordinate vrb  . But this correspondence an't be described if the relation is treated as binary relation between words  . 
We will propose how to extract he hierarchical relation with a logical form on verbs from definition sentences in a Japanese dictionary  . 
Firstly , we will define the logical form of the hierarchical relation on verbs and then discuss which part of the syntactic structure of the definition sentence represent shat relation  . We will call the main predicate verb in this part the definition verb  . Secondly , we will describe how to semiautomatically select he proper meaning of the definition verb and the proper correspondence between the variables of an entry verb and ones of the ~ lefinition verb  . Lastly , we will report about the result of a experiment to extract he ACTESDE  COLING-92  . NAr CrES . 2328 A Ol~r 1992574 PROC .

A verb will be corresponded to the nary predicate according to a pattern of cases  ( syntactic roles )  . Considering the polysemy of verbs , each meaning of a siugle verb must correspond to the distinct predicate  . For example ,  "~-~ & " ( love ) as first meaning is used with the form of " x ~$ ~   x2  '~ ~ ~" ( xt love x ~ ) * a a ~ d corresponds to ' ~- ~ ) - ~ 1  ( Xl , X2) ' . 
Furthermore , we will not deal with intensional verbs in this paper  . 
2 Logical Form of Hierarchical
Relation on Verbs
Verbs correspond to predicates on entities . If VL(rh , . . . , ~, ~) is the subordinate predicate of vU(~x , . . . , ~, , ), both predicates have the same arity ( i . e . m = n ) , there is a one-to-one correspondence ? from 1 ,   . .-, n  to 1, . . . ,n , and if VL(~I , "", ~ n ) is true , Vv(~f(U, . . . , ~ O(n )) is also true at the same time . That is,
W\[VL(x ) DVV(~)\] ,   ( 1 ) where boldface ~ e stands for a tuple of variables  . 
Strictly speaking , the logical form of the hierarchical relation on verbs is  ( 1 )  . 
For example , " fiktr1" is the subordinate verb of "~ F , 51"-To describe this logically , V z ~ x ~\ [ ~ ~( x ~ , x ~) ~~? ~( x ~ , z ~)\] , where ' ~1(rh , ~1~)' means that r/~drink~12 and ' ~ A ~ , 5 ~( Yl , r~2)' means that ~\]1 take 712 . 
But there are vL and vU such that some arguments invL  ( ~ h ,  . . . ,~ , ~) don't correspond to any arguments in Vu((t ,  ? "' , ( m ) or some in Vu (( I ,  "" ' , ( , n ) don't correspond to any arguments in VL(rlx ,   . . . , tin ), although vL is a subordinate verb of v ~ . In this case , we conclude that the predicate denoted by 9 yV~(~ , y ) is a subordinate one of the predicate denoted by qzVU  ( ~ e , z ) . Therefore , by generalizing (1) , we get ? Syntactic role is represented by meazts of a postpo~i-tion  , such as "7) 9 , and " ~" , in Japanese . 
that is,
We expand (2) further to restrict the domain of z , and define the logical form of the hierarchical relation on verbs as follows  . 
Definition IvL is a subordinate verb of v v , if for some Nw ~\[ v ~( ~ , ~) ~ N(~)^V ~( ~ , ~)\] , where bohl faceN stands for a tuple of predicate letters and N  ( z ) means N l ( Zl ) A .   .   . AN , ( z , , ) . 
A small letter , such as n , v , and vL , stands for a linguistic expression and a capital etter  , such as N , V , and VL , stands for the predicate symbol corresponding to the linguistic expression represented by its small letter  . 
I ~ brexample , " ~51" is a subordinate verb of " ~ rY 7 . , 1" because the following formula holds,
Vxy3z\[i ~ 5 l(y , x ) 7J ~ : ~ J(z ) A ' ~ ~ 7 o1(x , z )\] , where ~"31 ( r/1 , r/2): r/2 is irrigated by r/l , ff . ~(7/): r/ismoisture , ; ~ ff~7~1(~/1 , r/2): rll take on r/2 . 
3 Extraction 3 . 1 Ext rac t ing the Hierarchical Ex-p ress ion in a Def in i t ion Sentence Definit ion  2   77re relation between an entry verb v~t and its definition sentences is 
V ~\ [3y V ~( ~, y ) =-3z#(x,z)\].
For example , the definition sentence for "~ tr1" ( drink ) is "~? ~/ . #7 ol ' ( to take a drink ) and the definition sentence for " il ~ 5   1" is " TJ ~ ~ o ~ d ~ ) & ~: tY'51" ( to take on moisture fully )  . 
We gett For convenience , we will omit the number of the meaning of an entry verb  .

We call the main predicate verb of a definition sentence the definition verb  . If the definition sentence of a entry verb ve corresponds to 
N ( , ~) AYd ( , ~) ,   ( 3 ) then we can easily derive the hierarchical relation between v * and its definition verb vd from Definition  2  . In this paragraph , we assume that the meaning of the definition verb has been selected correctly and we will omit the number of the meaning of definition verbs  . How to select it will be given in 8 . 2 . 
A definition sentence does not always correspond to the logical form as  ( 3 )  . But if we can get the sentences ~ which is a part of the definition sentences and corresponds to the logical form as  ( 3 ) and SDSd , then we can also derive the hierarchical relation between the entry verb and the definition verb  . We calls ~ the hierarchical expression in a definition sentence  ( HED )  . 
Now , we will discuss which part of the syntactic structure of the definition sentence is HED  . 
Definition 3 We get rid of modifiers out of a simple sentence s  . We call the rest of s the kernel sentences ~ of s  . 
Since there is n't a expression corresponding to a universal quantifier in the definition sentence of a verb  , we can conclude the following characteristic . 
Characteristic 1 lfs ~ is the kernel sentence of a simple sentences  , then SDS ~ and the logical form of ~* is (3) . 
For example , the kernel sentence of "~?~ i ~-- I~lz ~ JT " ( to kill a pain in the body temporally ) is " ~ ~' Y " ( to kill a pain ) and its logical form is a ~ d the following formula holds  , 
V?\]1~2~8\[S(~1 , 7J2 , 718) 3 where S(711 , r \] ~ ,  7/8 ) is the formula corresponding to "~?~ i ~??-- I ~= ~ T " and means that  112 is a pain , 7/s is a body , and ~\]1kill7/2 in ~/3 temporally . ' ~( r /) ' means that ~/ is a pain . 
~TQh,r/2)' means that 711k ill ~/2.
There is a sentences which satisfies the following characteristic  . 
Characteristic 2 A sentences includes a sentence s ~ and SDS' . 
If the definition sentences of a verb is complex , then s satisfies Characteristic 2 and s*is its main clause . For example , the main clause of the sentence "~?~~ ~ J : 5 ~ zt ~ - ~3"   ( something adheres to X as it covers X ) is " ~ ~ , ~~; 5" ( something adheresto) , and it corresponds to the following formula ,  ~ , (~) A~'~-~(~1 , ~) , and the following formula holds , 
V ~ l~\[s(~ , ) where S(~\]l , r / ~) is the formula corresponding to " ~; O ~ ~ . ~3:~):~T . ~ ,   , and means that something r had here to r/2 as r/1 covers r/~ , ' ~ fi~0l ) ' means that ~/ is something , and '' ~ T~0/1 , r /~) ' means that r/1 adhere to r / ~ . 
Meaning of the compound sentences , in which two sentences (81 , 82 ) are connected by a conjunction corresponding to ' and ' in English  , is either ' S\]^$2' or ' after $1 ,  $2' . Therefore , an operator needs to decide the relation between 81 and s ~ . In the former case , s satisfies Characteristic 2 and s ~ can be both 81 and s ~ . For example , a sentence " ~ r ~ ~- ~ #" ~ : ~ , ~ ~ < ~ ?~ "? ? " ( to throw something and have it touched AcrEs bE COLING-92  . NAI , ~ ES . 2328 AO13T1992576 PROC . OFCOLING-92 . NANTES , AUG .  2328 . 1992 hard ) consists of two sentences . One is "/ , J '  ~ , ~ kil ~; : r "; b " ( to throw something ) , the otim r is " ~3:<:~~4- , 5" ( to have it touched hard ) , and two sentences correspond to following formulae respectively  ,  ~ , z < ~4-~(~ t ~ , ~\]~ , ~3) . 
And two sentences are simultaneous . So following formulae hold,
V ~/11'/2~/3\[S(~/hf12,r13)Dt . ~ (~) ^ ~'~ . ~' s(~a , ~)\],
V ~ I ~ , ~l ~ rl ~\ [ S(~h ,  ~ , ~/~) D where S(O \] ,  ~/~ ,  ~/3 ) is the formula con'esponding to "/ ~ D ) ~  ~17 T  ~ w 3:  < ~  ~7~"and means that r/1 throw 7/2 and have Y2 touched hard to ~ a . '@$~(~/)' means that ~\] is something . ' ~ E~f ~5(~/hO ~)' means that ~1 throw ~12 . ' ~3:<~~4-~(~ll ,  ~  ,  ~/3 ) ' means that ~/1 have r\]~touched hard to fla . 
To apply Characteristic 2 repeatedly , we conclude that there is a definition sentences which include a simple sentences ~ and SDS' aud that the kernel sentence of s~isHED  . ~ brex-a~nple , the sentences " ~ b , 5 ~ o(~)~k ~ oT <" ~:2-;5 t , : ~ l :---?~? ) 1 ~ ~~ : ~ o " ( ~ TlhJ1:-2?911"Z" ( to hold both ends of something and apply force to both sides in order to make it straight  ) is complex . It therefore satisfies Characteristic 2 and SD S1  , where Sl is its main clause " ~- q ) ~?~? ~ o ' ~ l fil ~ aJ3 ~-' ) JllP ~7~'' ( to hold both ends of something and apply force to both sides  )  , s \] is a compound sentence and is composed of s2 "- f ?~? ~ , ' ~ o " ( to hold both ends of something ) and s3"Ji ~: ) ~ J ' l ~ ll , T- ) 3 ~ ~13L 6" ( to apply force to both sides ) and two sentence is simultaneous . Sl therefore satisfies Characteristic 2 and S1 D $2 and S1 D $3  . Therefore , 5"D5'2 and SD$3 . Because 82 and 83 are simple sentences , the kernel sentences of 82 and 83 are HEDs . When the definition sentence is simple , its kernel sentence is HED . 
If we decide the proper meaning of the definition verb and the proper correspondence from cases of veto cases of vd correctly  , we conclude (4) N , (~ , )^ N , (~)^ V ~( ~ ,  ~)\] . 
We can get a hierarchical relation between ve and v't as follows from  ( 4 )  , wv ~\[ v ?( , ~ , v ) : ~ N ~(~)^ V % , ~)\] . 
3 . 2 Necessary Cond i t ion and Heur i s - t ic In this paragraph we supposed that an entry verb v ? has HED  . 
What we call the selectional restriction has been used to narrow down candidates fro'syntactic structnre in the syntactic processing  . It is the restriction about the semantic ategory of a noun phrase which a certain verb can take as a certain case  . The semantic ategory has been called the semantic marker or semantic prim ~ itive  , librexample , semantic ategories of the subjective noun phrase and the objective noun phrase for the verb " fik ? ~"  ( drink ) must be ' animal ' and ' liquid ' respectively . We use this inforomation to semiautomatically select the proper meaning of vd and the proper correspondence from cases of v ~ to cases of v d  . The information is mentioned in the Japanese dictionary we used for the experiment of extraction  . 
The restriction that if a verb vkc~m take a noun phrase with a e ~ e e the semantic a tegory of the noun phrase is D is expressed logically as follows  , w\[vk(~)~D ( ~ , )\] ,   ( ~ ) where xi is the argument corresponding to the case c  , and k is the meaning number of v . We call D in (5) the domain for c of v k . For example,
V ~ a~12\[~tt 1011 , ~'/2) Danimal@l ) Aliquid O?2)\] , where ' fi ~ . O1(~h , 712)' means that ~/1 drink ~2 . 
If the semantic a tegory of an olm n is D ,
WIN(x ) ~ D(~)\]. (6)
We call D in (6) the domain for n .
If the kth meaning is proper as v ~ in the definition sentence of v ~ and the correspondence from ith case of v ~ to jth ca~e of v ~ is correct  , then the following formula holds , ACTESDECOLING-92 , NANTES , 2328 AO~;1992577 PROC . OFCOLING-92, NAhrrl~s , Ano . 2328, 1992i
V . . . z . . . IV '( . . . , x , . . . ) (7) ?" AN(x ) A "" AV\[("',~,"')\] . 


Assumption 1We assume ~ xV ( zc ) is true for each verb v and B x N ( x ) is true for each noun n . 
We conclude ~ x\[De ( x ) ADn ( x ) ADd ( x ) \]  ( 8 ) from SwV ~ ( ~ )   ( Assumption 1 ) and ( 7 )  , where vvIV '( . . .  ,~, . . . ) ~ N'(~)\],)
V , I\[N(r/)DD"(r /)\].
We establish ( 8 ) as the necessary condition in which the correspondence is valid  . We check ( 8 ) with BxN ( x )   ( Assumption 1 ) and the relation between domain predicates . 
Necessary Condition If the kth meaning is proper as vd in the definition sentence of v ~ and the eom'a spondence from ith case of v ~ to jth case of v ~  . is correct , then
B x\[V ~( x)AD"(x)AD'l(x)\] , where D ~ is the domain for ith case of v ~ and D ~ is one for j-th case of v ~ and the noun of j-th case of v ~ in the definition sentence is n and the domain for n is D ' ~  . 
The meaning of an entry verb v ~ is defined by using the definition verb vd  . Then , the less the number of the variables appearing either only inv ~ or only invd  ( i . e .   ( size of tuple y )  +  ( size of tuple z ) in the formula ( 4 ) ) , the more v ~ restricts the meaning of vLAn editor of a dictionary would select such a definition verb  . 
We therefore stablish the following heuristic.
Heuristic The less the number of the variables appearing either only inv ~ or only invd  , the more we have chance of correct selection for meaning of v '~ and the correspondence of the variables  . 
3.3 Example of Extraction
In this paragraph the method how to extract the hierarchical relation on verbs will be introduced  . We suppose following definitions about "~-? "5" and "~9"   . 
~ t -'5
I \] ( human )  ~  ( human )  ~:\] ~-- ? & ~" ~ ) ~~ ~ a ~'" 3~~?~-9 .   ( to experience a strong feeling of f on dness ) I \ [ ( human )  ?~  ( hand ) V ( concrete ) ~:\]: ~ Iz ~~? ~'9 .   ( to have something with one's hand ) II\[ ( human )  ?~  ( human ) Iz ( mental ) ~:\] ~ ~ lz ~ , ~b  ~ ab , 5 ~ , ~ ? ~ (  .   ( to experience a feeling toward somebody ) III\[ ( all_entities )  ~?  ( abstract )  ~:\]  ( ghfi , g ) ~ ck~-J -'5 .   ( to have some property or equipment ) ? means that " ~ T . 5  1" is used with the form of " npl ~ np2  ~ ~ "~  "5" and the semanticate-gory of npl and np2 must have ' human ' . We get the following knowledge about domain of words  . 
Vn\[~-"5~(r / ~ , ~:) human(~l ) A human(~2)\] , Vr/\[~1(r / ~ ,  ~  , r/a ) D\[human(~l ) h
A h and ( r/2) A concreat(r/a)\]\],
V~\[~'9~(r/i , r/~,~'13) D\[human(r/1) h
A human ( r/2)A mental(r/~)\]\] , all_entities(o1)A abstract(o2)\] , 
Vr/\[~(r /) Dmental(~l)\].
' all_entities ' expresses the set of all entities . We suppose the following relation between domain predicates  , Vr/\[human(r /) V h and ( r /) D concrete(~)\] , 
Vr/\[mcntal(~)O abstract(~)\],
Vr/\[concrete(r /) V abstract(r /) D all . entities ( r /)\] ,  - , B~l\[concrcte(o ) A abstract(r /)\] , ~v\[human(~)^h and ( r /)\] . 
We parse the definition sentence "~"~~~-~& ~ 5  ~  t9   ~-9" for the entry verb "~ AcrEsDE COLING-92  , NANTES ,  23-28/ , OOT 199 2578 PROC . OFCOLING-92, NANTES , AUG .  2328 , 19927o1" , and we find this sentence is simple and its kernel sentence " ~  , ~?5~k ~-)" isHED . We narrow down candidates for the meaning of the definition verb " ~ o " on parsing by selectional restriction  . Meanings of " i ~ : o " that satisfy selectional restriction are II and  II1  . Since we can infer 3x\[human ( x ) A all_entities ( x ) l from Assumption I and the relation between domain predicate  , the correspondence from the first case of "'~-~ 6   1" to the first case of " ~ 3"satisfies the necessary condition described in paragraph 3  . 2 . Since we can infer ~-3x\[human ( x ) Amental ( x ) A abstract ( x ) \] , the correspondence from the first case of "' Z ! ?   70   1" to the second case of " ~ oa " does not satisfy the necessary condition  . After all , for "~~)2" and "~'~'-) a " , partial one-to-one correspondences which satisfy the necessary condition are ~  o2 : a . , b . < 1, 1>, c . < 1, 2>, d . < 2, 1>, e . <2,2>, f . < 1,1 >,< 2,2 >,  . q . < 1,2>, <2,1>, ~' oa:h . , i . < 1, 1>, j . < ~ , 1 > , For example , the correspondence g means that the first case of " N :- J  , 51" corresponds to the second case of " ~ . " 02" and the second case of "~-?& 1" corresponds to the first case of " N~~D 2"-Because the number of the variables which appear either " only in the entry verb or bl the definition verb for the correspondence g is  1 and one for the correspondence i is 2  , the pair of " ~ o2" and the correspondence g is prior to the pair of "~   o3" and the correspondence i by the heuristic . The pair of " ~ o ~" and the correspondence f and the pair of " ~  '9   2 and the correspondence g are given the highest priority by the heuristic after all  . 
it is decided by a operator that the second meaning of ~ and tile correspondence fare proper  , and we get
W ~ z\[~)-701(xl , z2 )   :9   4 Experiment of Extraction We have experimented on extracting the hierarchical relation using the machine-readable dictionary IPAL  ( IPA : Information-technology Promotion Agency , Japan ; IPAL : 1PA Lexicon of the Japanese language for computers )  .   861 verbs and 3379 meanings are contained in this dictionary . The definition sentence of an entry verb and the pattern of cases for the entry verb and the domain for each of the cases of the entry verb are given in this dictionary  ( see Appendix )  . 
And we can also get the domain for a noun from this dictionary  . 
We made a lexical functional grammar which outputs the logical for nl of HED as a feature  . 
We parsed the definition sentences and got 1709 HEDs whose main predicate verb are given as an entry verb in this dictionary with this gram -man  . We have extracted the hierarchical relations on verbs from  1288 IIEDs . The average number of candidates which are given the highest priority by the heuristic described in paragraph  3  . 2 is 4 . 6 and there is the correct solution in 4 . 6 candidates attile rate of 70 . 4% . The number of meanings of verbs in the highest layer in the hierarchy is  288  , and the average level in the hierarchy is 2 . 7 . Maybe this value is so little . 
We think in this point since IPAL is a basic verh dictionary its entry verbs are in a comparatively high ordinate in hierarchy of all verbs  . 
5 Conclusion
We have defined the logical form of tile hierarchical relation on verbs and have described how to extract it from definition sentences ill a 
Japanese dictionary.
The method described in this paper is for a Japanese dictionary  , but it can be applied to other languages dictionary  , too .
