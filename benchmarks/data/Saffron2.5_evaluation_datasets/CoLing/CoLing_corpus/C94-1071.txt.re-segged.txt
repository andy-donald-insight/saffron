Abstract
We present a new apl ) roach , il hlstrated by two algorithms > for parsing not only Finite SI  . ate ( : Iranlnlars but also ContextFree Grainlnars and their extension  , by means of finite state machines . '/' he basis is the computation of a flxed point of a linite-state function  , i . e . 
a finite-state transducer . Using these techniques , we have built a program that parses French sentences with a gramnlar of more than  200>000 lexical rules with a typical response time of less than a second  . The tirst algorithm computes a fixed point of a non-deterluinistic tinite-state transducer and the second coniplites a lixed point of a deterministic bidirectiollal device called a bimachine  . These two algoril ; hmspoint out a new connection between the theory of parsing and the theory of representation of rational transduetions  . 

Fhlite state devices have recently attracted a hit of interest in computation a linguistics  . Couiputational ellieion cy has been drastically improved for n  ) or pho-logical analysis by representing large dictionaries with FiniteState Automata  ( FSA ) and by represent higtwo-level rnles and le?ical hlforination with finite-state transducers  \[8  , 4\] More recently ,   \[11\] has achieved parsing with low level lexical sensitivity by n leans of linite state automata  . Finite state apl ) roximation of co ~ , text-free grammars also proved both useful and efficient for certain application  \[9\]  . 
One COl Yimonr notiwttion of all this work is to in l-prove efficiency dranlatically  , hoth hitel ' illSoft in le and sl ) a , e e . These results often providel ) rOgl'anls orders of magnitude faster than more traditional hnplenienta-lions  . Moreover , F ~ As area natural way I . o express lexie alsensitivity , which has always lieellar eqlih'enient in lnorphology and which has proved crucial in syll - tax  . The granllllar we used for French : called Lexh : on-Grammar  ( set , \[61\[7\]\[2\]\[3\]\[i01 for insta , ,cc ) , pushes the lexiealization very far and it is our I  ) elief that this lexicalization trend will alnplify itself and that it will rest llt i  , l grammar several orders of magnitn de larger than today's representations  . This nn covers the need for new methods that will be able to handle such largescale grammars  , * Supported by a DRI'\]T-EcoIel % ly technique contract  , this work w ; Ls done at the \] nst it ut ( ~ ; tSl ) ~ u'd Monge and ~ tt the LADL . 
I lowever , at nahl drawback of the lit ; irest , ate approach to syntax is the dilllcnlty of representing hierarchical data  ; this partly explains why l'~SA-based pro-grall lS olly do ill cnllll  ) leteparsillg .

The parser in term of rational transductlon In our parser  , the grammar is a rational transdncti0nf , represented by a transducer T . The inlut of the parser is the sets o containing as only element he input sentence bounded by the phrase marker\[P \]  , i . e . 
so =\[ P\]sentence\[P \] . The analysis consists in computing sl = f(so) , s2 = f(st ) until a tixed point is reached , i . e . s t , = f(s p ) . The sets v contains trees represented by bracketed strings  , this set is the set of grammatical analysis of the sentence  , it contains more than one element in the case of syntactically ambiguous inputs  . Each sets l is represented by a Directed Acyclic Graph  ( DA ( 1 ) Ai , thus the computation consists in applying the transducer  7' on the DAG seli . 
We shall write it Ai+l = T(Ai).
In the next section we give two complet examples of that  . 
TWOSIMPLE EXAMPLES
An example of a Top-Down analysis
The graph on figurel describes the analysis of the sentence : sl = John said that Mary left The graph on this figure has to be read in the following way : the inpnt sentence is represented by the DAGA ton the upper left corner  ; the subset of the grammar required for the analysis of this sentence is the transducer fon the right hand side of the figure  1  . 
The analysis is then computed in the following way : we apply the transducer f to Al  , that is we compute A2 = f(Al ) , this represents one step of a Top-Down analysis of the sentence  . The box with a star inside represents this operation  , namely applying a transducer to a DA(I . If we then apply f to this result ( i . e . 
AQ , we obtain Aa = f(A2) = f ~( Al ) represented under A2 . If this operation is applied once more , one gets A4 = f(Aa ) = fa(A1) . This last result , A4 , is a fixed point of the transducer f , i . e . f(A4) = A4 . A4 is a DAG that represents a finite set ?' et ( A4 ) of strings , llere , this set only contains one elmnent , namely ?' et ( A4 )  =   ( John ) NO ( said ) VO ( that ( Ma , ' y ) NO(left . ) VO ) That , ~' . 
Each element is a bracketed rel ) resental . ion of an analysis . I \] ere the analysis is unique . 
An example of a simultaneous Top-Down
Bottom-Up analysis
The previous example might give the iml ) ression that coml ) uting a fixed l ) oint of a transducer atttomatically leads to simulating a topdown contextfree analysis  . 
However , we shall now see that using the tlexibility of manipulating transducers  , namely being able to compute the composition and the union of two transducers  , allows a context sensitive parsing which is simultaneously Top-Down and Bottom-up with the possibility of choosing which kind of rule should be parsed Bottom-

The second approach is to try using a different representation fTor to apply it differently  . In this section , we shall give an algorithm illustrating this second al~l ~ roaeh  . The basic idea is to transform tile finite-state transducer into a deterministic device called bimae hine  \[1\]  . We will detail that latter but , basically , abimae hine stands for a left sequential fimetion  ( i . e deterministic from left to righ Q composed to a right sequential function  ( i . e . deterministic from right to left ) . Such a decomposition always exists . 
The interest of this concept appears when one looks at how tile algorithm Apply Transdueer performs  . 
In fact the output DAG of this algorithm has a lot of states that lead to nothing  , i . e . states that are note o a ceessible , thustile PR , UNE function ( called on live 14 of the Apply Transducer function ) has to remove most of the states ( around 90% in our parser of

IMPLEMENTATION AND RESULTS
The main motivation for this workeo , nes from the linguistic claim that the syntactic rules  , roughly the sentence structures , are mostly lexieal . The gralnmar of Freuehwelind at our disposal was so large that noue of the awdlable parsers could handle it  . 
Although the inq ) lement . edl ) art of the gramnlar is still in c(mll)\[el . e , itah'ea(lydescribes2 , 878 sentential verbs ( coming from\[6\]) , I .

Thus , t . he grammar describes 10 , 479 entries aud 229 , 035 lexieal rnles .
