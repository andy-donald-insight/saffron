1 Introduction . The Problem
Phonological theory has undergone a number cf more or less radical changes in recent years  . Mo-dels of nonlinea representation f features , constraints on the abstractness of rules , and theories of underspecification ( imposing conditions on possible underlying features and their values  , avoiding redundancy ) are all part of current phonological thinking . 
Considerations of the formalisms involved in these theories have not been pursued to a large extent  . 
!', . has become increasingly clear , however , that different representational formats lead to differen-ces in the formalisms required for phonological rules  . Recently , there have also been attempts to clarify the formal status of associations between elements cn differentiers  ( Sagey 1988 , Hammond 19 ~8 , Bird & Klein 1989) . This paper is an attempt to clarify some of the properties cf phonological rules and representations by applying the concepts of unification formalisms to phonological theory  . 
A crucial part of any unification-based phonological theory is the elimination of feature -changing rules from the list of possible rules in the framework  . Feature-changing rules stand in clear oppe-s it bn to the incremental  , monotonic nature of unification grammars . In the following , it wilt be shown how acLange of feature-values can be avoided for a rule which  , first , is a regular phone--logical rule within any phonological theory that allows for phonological rules at all  , and which , second , has always been formulated as a feature-changing rule  ( see literature from Kiparsky 1968 to Rubach 1990 )  . t 2 A standard analysis of German Final Devoieing The rule in question is one of the classical examples of a neutralization rule  , namely the rule of Final Devoicing ( Auslautverh ~' rtung , FD for short ) in the phonology of Standard German . It neutrali-zes the phonemi contrast between voiced and unvoiced obstruents in a particular position  ( namely syllable-finally )  . The standard view of this rule is that it changes voiced obstruents in syllable-final position into their unvoiced counterparts  . Examples are provided in (1) , and a feature-changing version of this rule is given in  ( 2 )  . It is clear now that the relevant domain for the rule is the syllable  ( see Vennemann 1978 , Wiese 1988) ; depending on the model of syllabic structure , the precise formulation of the context description can vary  , referring to the syllable edge as in ( 2 ) or to the final constituent of the syllable fl ( i )

Note that the rule changes the value of a feature  . In the framework assumed , this is necessarily so , since in the \[- sonorant \]- class , voicing is distinctive , so that both/b/and/p/are assigned this feature  .   ( 4 ) demonstrates that a different syllabification ( due to suffixation ) correctly prevents FD from applying . 3(3) (4) a . /lo:b/a,/Io . b/b . - - - b . /lo : b ? os/c . 0e . ( Jod . od .

FD(2)
How could FD be formulated in a non-feature -changing way without giving up the goal of capturing all generalizations that hold for this rule ? The following considerations rely on some  ( fairly uncontroversial ) assumptions about phonological representation . First , in accordance with underspeci-fieation theory , it will be assumed that redundant feature values are not present in underlying representations  ( lexical entries )  . For the relevant segments this means that the voiced obstruents are marked as r + voiced\]  , whereas unvoiced obstruents are not marked for this feature  . General considerations of markednes support this choice : Voice-less obstruents are more common  , have a wider distribution , are acquired earlier in language acquisition , etc . 
Secondly , all features , including those representing a segment , are represented in a nonlinear , associ-ative way . In particular , a hierarchical model of the segment in the version of McCarthy  ( 1988: 105 ) is adopted . In this particular version of a feature hierarchy  , all nodes are characterized by the presence of particular features that constitute the node  . (5) is not quite complete , but allows the representation of most natural classes of segments  . 4 ( Conceivably , as argued by Goldsmith (1990: oh . 
6 . 2) , under assumptions of underspecification , the feature hierarchy in ( 5 ) and in comparable propo-sals is too elaborate . For the present purposes , the only important assumption is that features and their values are organized hierarchically  . ) We will interpret the feature hierarchy in ( 5 ) as an admissibility tree . Features are only allowed if they enter the relations expressed in this tree  . Furthermore , the relations ( " associations " in the terminology of nonlinear phonology  ) are interpreted as being transitive . The values of features are propagated ( as instructions to the artiaulatory apparatus ) along the paths specified by the relations to the root  . In (6) , the feature tree ( 5 ) is receded into a complex feature structure . Every feature takes as avMue either one of the terminals  ( "+ " or "-" ) or another feature structure . Associations are ex--pressed by a feature A with the interpretation for tile associations as just given  . ( Different instances receive numerical indices . ) As a template for possible segments , this structure does not contain the terminal values  , i . e . + and - . These values are denoted by "\[\]% the empty feature structure  , if unspe-cified .

I kind are very limited . We allow only the folio-wing types of formal operations : - insertion of associations fi- deletion of associations  ( " delinking " )  . 
The first operation generally occurs through unification  . Unification here is the combination of lexical entries and regularities that are independently motivated and expressed as feature structures  . The information in the feature structures is combined  , leading to statements that particular relations hold  . In particular , the assignment of default va-lues for features is achieved through unifying the feature structures that express the default value with representations for lexical entries that do not contain a specified value for the respective feature  . Dc linking , on the other hand , is not so readily modeled with unificational means  ( as presented by Shieber 1986 or Carlson & Linden 1987  )  ; it can be seen , however , as the introduction of generaliz- , ~ tion (" the dual of unification " , Shieber (1986:64)) into the theory . Under generalization of two feature strucures , only information contained in both is kept ; all other information is lost . We will now show that using generalization alongs ideunification allows us to state FD widmut the bvocation of a feature-changing rule  . 
The typology of rules proposed here does not allow feature values to be changed  . The treatment of FD in German , then , is the following . Taking / d/and/t/as examples , marking for\[voiced\]is expressed underlyingly as in  ( 7 )  . 6 There exists a default rule ( 8 ) that in general ( i . e . , in the absence of other provisions ) allows values for\[voiced\]to be identical to the value for the feature \[ so no rant \]  . This rule uses feature reentrancy . ( Possibly , so no rancy itself is also underspecified , but this is left out of consideration here . ) Furthermore , there is no rule of FD but a well-formed ncss condition  ( 9 ) which explicitly requires obstruents to be \[- voiced \] syl-lable-finally  .   ( 8 ) and ( 9 ) are shorthand notations for the more complex formulations within the lea-ture structure  . The crucial step in the derivation of , say , R , ~ lt\] , with an underlying / d / , is the generalization of the two feature structures  ( 7a ) and ( 9 )  , with different values for \[ voiced\] . As a result , \[ voiced\]isunspecified .   ( 10 ) illustrates the steps in the application of the various mechanisms leading to the devoicing of / d /  . The apparent change in the value vet\[voiced\] is possible because of generalization  , which removes a value , and the existence of the default rule , which provides a value . 
(7) a . /d / :\[ voiced : +\] b . /t/:\[voiced:\[\]\] ( 8 )   ( 9 ) \[sonorant ~@ qrsonorant : -\]\] voiced: UUAL voiced :- syllable  ( 10 ) a . Vsonorant : - L voiced : +\] underlying b . L voiced : VS ? n ? rant :\[\]- m \] syllabification , --syllable generalization with (9) c . Vsonorant : -\]\] default-rule , L voiced :- syllable unification with ( 8 ) It nmst best ressed that this proposal for the treatment of FD has one major advantage over the traditional analysis : While it is clear that neutralizat-ion processe such as FD always disallow the more marked member of the pair in question  , there is nothing in the formalism for the FD rule  ( 2 ) that would formally disallow a rule that leads to the marked member of the pair  . This , however , is impossible in the framework introduced here . If a wellformedness condition analogous to ( 9 ) would require a voiced obstruent syllable -finally  , there would not be a rule which could provide the value\[+voiced\]  . There simply is no rule comparable to default rule  ( 8 )  . In other words , neutralization for\[voiced\]can only lead to \[- voiced \] because there is a well-motivated efault rule providing this value  . In this sense , the solution in the framework given has a higher explanatory level than the ones operating with a feature-changing rule  , where both types of change , from marked to unmarked and from unmarked to marked  , are equally complex . 
4 Conclusions
The relationship between phonology and computational linguistics has various aspects  . On one level , one might want to argue for a better treatment Of phonological knowledge in language-pro-cessing systems  ( see remarks in Wiese 1986 )  . On another level , it is instructive to observe how phonological theory can be shaped by explicitly computational considerations  . 
Rules in nonlinear phonology are to a large extent not feature-changing  , especially if underspeci-constitutes additional motivation for the line of reasoning in this paper  . We hope to have shown , first , that an analysis of FD without the invocation of a feature-changing rule is actually the preferred solution  . Secondly , a large number of well-established rules , namely the members of the class of neutralization rules  , can be analysed as particular instances of unification  . 
However , the concept of generalization ( as a form-alinter pretation of delinking as this concept is standardly used in nonlinear phonology  ) cannot be avoided in an adequate treatment of these cases  . 
It is in the very nature of neutralization that some information  ( here on the voicing of a consonant ) is not retained underspecific circumstances . In that sense , phonological rule applications cannot constitute a strictly monotonic system  , unless we are willing to give up well-motivated linguistic generalizations  . Finally , we take side with Hammon d ( 1988 ) on the question of how association lines are to be interpreted : transitivity is a crucial property of these relations  , since the feature structures are highly hierarchical  . 
Future work in this are a must also answer the question what principles determine and restrict the applicability of generalization  . Generalization should not be applicable whenever unification fails  . But it seems to be in the nature of phonology that linguistic items can be realized even if they violate some valid wellformedness conditions : Lexical entries in German end up being realized as words despite the fact that they contain an underlying voiced obstruent which violates FD  . In numerous other cases , whole segments are deleted because they do not conform to phonotactic patterns or si-milar constraints  . It is in this area that unification must be supplemented with generalization  . 
Footnotes i ) Theories with only one level of description , especially in the work of Vennemann , provide the major exception to this statement . 
2 ) Application of FD to recent Ioan words such as orange in  ( i ) shows first that this rule is totally productive , and , secondly , that it is indeed applicable to all segments marked as \[- sonorant \]  . The native stock of German words does not display a phoneme  /3  /  , but in orange this sound is readily devoiced to / f /  . 
3) Details of syllable structure are omitted , because they are irrelevant for present purposes . 
4 ) The feature \[ voiced\]used here in the descript-ion of FD is probably a shorthand notation fc~ra particular configuration of the larynge alstates  . In ( 5 ) it is expressed as a particular configuration of glottal states  . 
5 ) This comes in two sub-eases : the spreading of a feature value to several nodes  , as in the various harmony and assimilation rules , and the linking of a " floating " feature to a node  . 
6 ) The markings in ( 7 ) hold for all occurrences of / d / and / t / . He relies the difference to the classical archiphonemie treatment of neutralization  ( Jakobson 1929 , Trubetzkoy 1939) , where a narchi-phoneme/D/is postulated only in the context of neutralization  .
