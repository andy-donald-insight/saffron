This work represents an attempt outilize the computer in solving 
problems in historical inguistics.
The corpus upon which it operates in ot a language but a recently published etymological dictionary of Old Cornish  .   1 Any observations regarding the scarcity or in accuracy of the data utilized are  , therefore , irrelevant , as far as the present paper is concerned . 
As the dictionary in question was compiled according to the usual methods employed with such works  , a detailed explanation of methodology is unnecessary  . It should also be noted that Old Cornish is known only through glosses to Latin words  , and that in this case < ~ Cor-nish gloss ~ is equivalento ~ Cornish word ~  . 
With the help of the computer , we have attempted to solve the following problems : a  ) To establish the percentage of words with and without Indo-European etymology in the Cornish lexicon  .   ( Let us stress that this study concerns not a language but an etymological lexicon  ; hence , the presence or absence of Indo-European etymology should not be construed as a definitive characteristic of a Cornish word  . Such statistics are , in fact , relevant only to the present state of research on the subject  )  . 
b ) To establish the degree of certainty concerning the material of Indo-European etymology  . 
c ) To evaluate the extent of the connection between elements of Indo-European etymology existing in the Cornish lexicon and the other Indo-European linguistic groups according to the degree of certainty of each individual etymology  . 
d ) To establish , on the basis of existing etymological studies of Old Cornish  , the lines future research should follow .

The reader will observe that the ftrst problem is purely statistical  ( though it has an obvious diachronic premise )  , that the second aims at attaining qualitative data  ( though they are expressed quantitatively )  , that the third concerns the area of Indo -European dialectology  , and that the fourth has its own specific heuristic and methodological signifidance  . 
In order to acc0 mplish these goals , the contents of the etymological dictionary were put on cards  , each of which contained the following entries : a  ) a non-Cornish word ( with an indication of the language to which it belongs  )  ; b ) the Cornish word related in the dictionary to the item under a  )   ; c ) the type of relationship existing between item a ) and item b )   ; and whether this relationship is afftrmed , denied or uncertain ; d ) the indication that item b ) is or is not a nominal compound ( this being the only type of compound found in Old Cornish  )  ; e ) in the event that item b ) is a nominal compound , a breakdown of the elements contained in it ; 2f ) the page from which the foregoing material was taken  . 
With regard to item c ) , the possible types of relationships have been described  ( see below ) according to the information supplied , either explicitly or implicitly , by the etymological dictionary and have been rated according to the following numerical system  :   1 = the relationship between the two words is etymologically certain  . 
2=~~) very probable.
3 = ~ ~ probable 4 = ~~ doubtful 5 = ~~ not very probable 6 - - - - ~ ~ improbable 7  =  , ~~ nonexistent 8 = the Cornish word was borrowed from item a ) 80 = ~~ is a caique from item a )   82 = a relationship exists between the Cornish word and item a  )  , but the nature of the relationship cannot be determined exactly  ( that is , whether it is a matter of k in ship or loan ) . a Every element has been given either in the Cornish form  ( if it is attested elsewhere in the text or if it is not attested only because of lack of documentation  )  , or in the common Celtic form or in the Indo -European form  ; certain diacritic signs indicate which possibility has been chosen  .

But , from the point of view of historicalinguistics , it is evident that , while gull has not been attested as an autonomous form merely because no documentation happens to be available on the subject  , he-existed ( and always has existed ) only as a member of a compound . 
Nevertheless , while gull could possibly be included among the autonomous lexical elements of our text  , he-could only be found among the morphemes . And finally , the compound he wuil , as a creation of the Cornish ( or Celtic ) age , has no precise equivalents in other Indo-Euro -pean languages  , and any equivalents that happen to exist may be considered a priori only the result of chance  . 
The task of analyzing compounds is further complicated by the presence of words  ( the Latin credere , for instance ) that from a diachro-nicpoint of view are compounds while from a synchronic point of view they are not  . 
For the reasons just stated , we decided to eliminate the compounds from the present analyses and to make them the object of a separate study  . 
Thus , in addition to the words with a rating of 0 , entries containing the signs = and-or-have also been discarded  .

After the words with a rating of 0 and the nominal compounds were discarded , the surviving Cornish material consisted of 745 elements that , in relation to our first problem , were subdivided in the following way .

The breakdown is as follows : words of certain etymology  13 words of very probable etymology 14 words of probable etymology 15   238   84 ?/ o 23   8%   23   8 ?/ o 284   100 ?/ o In order to solve the third problem , all the entries containing non-Cornish words correlated to one of the  284 Cornish words of Indo-European etymology were taken into consideration  . These entries ( 742 in all ) were subdivided into 17 groups according to the \] inguistic k in ship of the language to which the word in item  ( a ) belongs : l ~ To carian A and B2~Sanskrit , Avestan , Persian ( Aryangroup )   3 ~ Armenian 8 Words carrying at least one k in ship index of 1  , 2 or 3 .

The reader will notice that not all Indo-European languages are represented here  . This is due to the fact that not all Indo -European languages are represented in the etymological dictionary that provided the material for the present work  . On the other hand , there are two non-Indo-European languages in group  17 because one Cornish word is though to have a kinship with non-Indo-European words  . 
Each of the 742 words has an etymological kinship with Cornish words that is either certain  ( rating 1 )  , very probable ( rating 2) or probable ( rating 3) . These words were arranged into linguistic groups with the rank of  1 going to the group that had at least one exponent with a rating of  1  , the rank of 2 going to the group with at least one exponent with a rating of  2  , and the rank of 3 to the group with neither rating .

It will be observed that the Celtic group appears to be poorly represented in that the existing etymological kinship with Cornish words is normally expressed by the rating  9   ( and not , therefore ,  1 , 2 or 3) , while the rank of 1 , 2 or 3 has been attributed only to those words which , though still within the Celtic group , are part of other linguistic traditions ( words of the Celtic substratum in the romance languages  , for example ) .

2 ) The vast majority of the words with an Indo -European ety-mology  ( 238 out of 284 = 84~/o ) have an etymology that is certain , as far as is known at the present state of research on the subject  . Ano-ther 16 ~ have etymologies that are either very probable ( 23 ; 8 ~) or merely probable (23 ;  8 ~) . 
3 ) With regard to etymological kinships with non -Celtic Indo-European linguistic groups  , the closest connections are with German (0 . 2291), Latin (0 . 1698), Indo-~yan (0 . 1523), Greek (0 . 1469) and with Baltic (0 . 1146) . Such results appear to be extremely important in that they conftrm the innovative character of the occidental lexicon  ( kinships with German , Latin and , at least in part , Baltic ) existing side with the preservation of archaic elements in later alare as  ( kinship with Indo-Aryan )  , thereby showing strong k in ships with the central area of the Indo-European world  ( Greek and , at least in part , Baltic ) which have yet to be adequately assessed . 
4 ) The highest'percentages of now unacceptable relationships suggested by scholars in the past are those with Lati/a  ( 0 . 2600), Greek (0 . 1350) and Indo-A_ryan (0 . 1300) . This , together with the fact that these same groups have also yielded a very high percentage of accep -table etymologies  , suggests that these areas have been exhausted . As working hypothesis , new etymological comparison sought now to be considered particularly with German and Baltic  , which combine a high yield with a more tolerable percentage of acknowledged errors  ( 0 . 0850 and 0 . 0750 respectively ) . 
170 E . CAMPANILE-A . ZAMPOLLI5 ) Of the 745 Cornish words which have supplied the material for the present study  , as many as 671 , almost 90?/o , bear at least an index of 9; that is , have one or more Celticco-radicals . This confirms the , compact ~) character of the Celtic lexicon . 
Moreover , there are Cornish words which have one or more indices of  9 to the exclusion of any other index ( 139 ; 18 ~/ o ) " These are words that have co-radicals exclusively in the Celtic world  . On the heuristic level , this verification gives rise to a question that is at the same time a working hypothesis : are they substratum words ? The same question and the same working hypothesis also arise with the words where one or more indices of  9 accompany the indices 4  ,  5 ,  6 ,   7: these are words with Celticco-radicals formerly thought to be of Indo-European etymology but now refuted in the dictionary  , 
They are 60.
Our analysis , therefore , seems to suggest , oo , that future linguistic research will fredrich material for substratum studies in Cornish and  , more generally , in Celtic .
