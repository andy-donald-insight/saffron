Summary : The paper introduces an alternative to the lexical rules in a lexicon in a HPSG style by replacing them by relational constraints corresponding more directly to the standard lexicographic and morphological practice  . 
1. INTRODUCTION
The Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar ( HPSG , Polhu'd & Sag , 87 and 93 ) came into be = ingas and remains a predominantly sntactic theory  . This is reflected not only in the main theoret ~ ical orientation  , but also in the structuration of linguistic data within  ( the standard versions o0 the theory . 
As the majot-ity , if not all , current heo-ries , HPSG relies on a nample representation f linguistic knowledge within the lexicon rather than in the grammar rules  . This knowledge , then , is in HPSG organized in a crossing inheritance hierarchy of lexical types  , which should express the regularities and generalizations ~ v  , :curring in the lexicon and thus awfid redundants ipulations  . 
However , in spite of the fact that the lexicon-at least as far as the amount of information is concerned -plays an absolutely central role in the theory  , the organization of data within HPSG clearly reflects the primary syntactic oncertiof the theory  , with lexicon on a secondary position only . In particular , this comes into light when the presence of more tradition '  , fl views of organization of lexical data ( proved useful by long lexicographic and linguistic practice  ) is sought-such views are represented only marginally or not at all t  . 
in this paper , Ishalltry ( i ) to show that neglecting standard insights of the organization of lexicon is detrimental both to the linguistic adequacy and to the practical usefid-ness of the lexicon  ,   ( ii ) to make a proposal of an alternative r concil ~ ing the needs of HPSG with the usual lexicographic practice  . 
2. TIlEHPSG STANDARD
As the basic type of object of linguistic description HPSG adopts the sign  2  , and builds a subsumption hierarchy of its subtypes  , whose top level is sketched in (1) . 
sign phrasal lexical/\ major milxo ~ The idea behind this hierarchy is that each node is associated with bundles of features  , which are inherited by all nodes directly or indirectly subordinated to this node  , by means of which a lot of redundant stipulations of features can be removed  . 
There are , however , two points about the hierarchy fi'om ( 1 ) which may be worth reconsid-ering . First , it is the fact that linguistics in general is concerned with a broader class of objects thau signs-e  . g . , phonemes , morphs etc . are objects having no semantics , i . e . they ~- by definition-cannot fall into the class of signs  , and if ItPSG aims at be coining a full linguistic theory  , these objects have to be also taken into consideration  . 
Second , the hierarchy reflects only the syntactically motivate division of lexic ~ d signs into major and minor ones  , but tire other possible - and in fact more standard-divisions into autosemantic vs  . synsemantic3 words and productive vs . nonproductive word classes are missing . 
Apart from this , tlPSG stipulates tire lexicon to be a full-for nl one  , i . e . a lexicon where all wordforms of a language occur as actual items in the lexicon  ( leaf nodes in the hierarchy )  . This is also an approach which hardly finds a parallel in the standard lexicographic practice  ( even for lan~guages with that poor morphology as English has  )  , and in addition an approach which at least on the explanatory level enforces the necessity of lexical  ( redundancy ) rules - which , on the other hand , do not fit into the general image of HPSG at all . 
l ' rovided that the lexicon is viewed from a " declarative " perspective  4  , the lexical rules express static rehttionships ( uchas inflection ) between members of word classes . These relationships are , however , not needed for the fimction-ing of the system ( since all wordforms are available anyway ) -they have to exist only because without hem the lexicon would be linguistically clearly inadequate  . 
The other option , namely the " procedural " perspective , seems to be even worse , since it breaks the overall " declarative " strategy of HPSG  ; in particular , it enforces in equality of status of different lexical items  ( some being " basic " and some beiug only " derived "- in the very procedural sense of the word  )  . 
823 3. RELATION ALCONSTRAINTS
ASALTERNATIVE
Based on the preceding facts and ( first of all ) on the standard linguistic practice , it is possible to propose an alternative hierarchy of objects a linguistic theory should deal with  , whose " top part " can be sketched as in the crossing hierarchy given in  ( 2 )  , where appurtenance of several subtypes of a type to classification according to the same key is marked off by an arc connecting the respective branches of the hierarchy-in particular  , two divisions according to different keys are to be observed for the class " linguistic object "  , one corresponding to a " functional " perspective  ( the division into signs and non-signs )  , the other one corresponding to a " formalisfic " perspective  5  . 
( 2  ) linguistic object sign non-sxgn phrase word word -base morpheme autosynsemtic auto-  , , - wd morph syn-s-wd auto-s-m syn-s-m Among members of this hierarchy  , certain parallels are to be observed . In particular , it is worth to observe the parallel between the construction of phrases  ( which consist of words ) and the construction of words ( consisting of morphemes and-in case of composed words-of bases  , i . e . 
combinations of autosemantic morphemes ) . In an HPSG-like notation , the " consisting of " can be approximated by the feature structure  ( 3 )  , with obvious meaning of the relational constraints phon_consists_of and sem_cons is ts_of  .

YLse ~: : z(n + iUjj
The parallel , however , does not go much farther than that . In particular , the differences are that : a . phrases consist of other phrases , but words ( at least as a rule ) do not consist of other words b . for a word , at most one among its constituents , Rebase , is autosemantic ( at least as a rule , again ) Taking into consideration this as well as still other factors  , one can build up in more detail the top of the hierarchy of linguistic objects as in  ( 4 )   ( the " lexicon " part of the hierarchy being marked off by the interrupted line  )  .

By the very fact that this class-by definition -subsumes all inflected words and by parallel to  ( 3 )  , this class should be associated with the constrained feature structure  ( 5 )  . 
824 (5) phon:1 prefixes :\[ phon . 3\],\[phon:5\], . . . , \[ phon : 2n+l \] base: 2 suffixes : \[ phon: 4\]  , \[phon:6\] ,   . . . . \[ phon : 2k+2\] & phon cons is ts of ( l ,  3 , 5 ,   .   .   . , 2n + i , 2, 4, 6, .   .   .   , 2k+2 ) The definition of the relational constraint in ( 5 ) is actually the formal definition of inflection in the respective language  6  . In particular , this allows for expressing the part-of-speech independent regularities of inflection on one slot of the language model rather than repeatedly as with standard lexical rules  ( an example of such regularity might be the infix -e-in English words " goes " and " potatoes "  )  . 
Having viewed the " top " part of the lexical hierarchy  , let us turn our attention now to its bottom and middle  . 
The leaf elements of the hierarchy are lexemes - feature bundles encoding the most idiosyncratic information about a particular word  . 
As a rule , a lexeme consists of the base Croot " ) of the word and of these martic information associated with this base  . 
In the typical case , a lexeme of an inflected word has two immediate superclasses  . 
These correspond to the cross-classification f ( inflected ) words according to , first , subcategorization requirements of the respective word  ( as in standard HPSG )  , and , second , according to the inflection class of the word . The respective subcategorization class then assigns to the word those subcategorization requirements which are not influenced by its morphology  , as well as basic information about he nature of subcategorization requirements which do undergo changes due to the morphological form of the word  . The inflection class , then , in the form of a relational constraint ties together the morphological features of the word with the respective affix  ( es )  , the constraint being in fact the ( traditional ) inflection table . 
Finally , when these two classes meet upper in the hierarchy  , the class where they meet defines , again via a relational constraint , he exact relation between the subcategorization a d the morphological form of the word  . The example ( 6 ) showing the verb " accuse " might clarify this . 
(6 ) " ~ inverb " ~ form: 1 subcat :2 va~s~cat:fixed subcat://"conjugation class No  . 154" ~ form : uffix : ~& conjug_class 154 (1 , 2) & define subcat(l ,  2 ,  3 ,  4 ) " transitive "\ [ varsub cat : NP\[nom\ ]   , NP\[acc\]\]

The simplest solution in this case is to associate the respective relational constraint expressing inflection directly with the lexeme  , cf . 
example ( 7 )   ( technical variations concerning tile base and affixes are possible  , but in substantial ) .

8254. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper Itried to show how relational constraints can take over the bulk of  ( if not all ) the work which is in standard HPSG assigned to the operation of lexical rules  . 
Such an approach as at least the following two major advantages :  1  . it is much more straightforwardly related to the standard lexicographic and morphological usage  , a matter which is of a remarkable theoretical nd even greater practical importance  2  . the disadvantages of the lexical rules approach to lexicon mentioned in the first part of this paper  ( either inherent procedurality of the description or inherent redundancies in the description  ) disappear with the replacement of the ( also formally poorly understood ) lexical rules by the standard machinery of relational constraints  . 
As a minor point in favour of the sketched approach it might be noted that it also easily avoids such counterintuitive stipulations as postu-lating the division of English verbs into classes " auxiliary "  , " main " and a singleton class " have-as-abstract -verb "  ( cf . Pollard and Sag , 87, p . 215 ) which was necessary due to the fact that both the main verb " have " and the auxiliary " have " are of the same-idiosyncratic-inflection class  . All that is necessary to say on the given approach is that the two " have " s differ as to their contents and as to their subcategorization  ( i . e . they constitute two lexemes at the bottom of the lexical hierarchy  )  , while simultaneously belonging to the same conjugation class  , cf .  (8) . 
" conjugation of have .   .   .   . main verb .   .   .   . aux verb"/\[content:\[reln:possession \]\]\[ content :\[ reln : < empty >\]\] As for applications  , a large computational lexicon of Czech , based on ideas presented in this paper , is currently under preparation in the framework of a project aiming at the development of a prototype of a grammar-checker  . Tiffs project is being carried out jointly with the Charles 
University in Prague.

Suggestions for further eading from ( Pollard & Sag , 87) p . 

The key ideas in this chapter ( i . e . " The Lexical Hierarchy and Lexical Rules " ) arise not from previous linguistic studies , but rather from algebraic approaches to data type theory and the semantics of programming such as  . . . ; similar ideas are widely employed inframe-based knowledge representation systems  ( see . . . ) . 
l just want to point out that hardly anyone would protest if " the key ideas  . . . arise not ONLY from previous linguistic studies , but ALSO from . . . " . t lowever , the current wording explicitly excludes any reference to previous linguistic work  . 
2 1n accordance with the traditiongoing back at least ode Saussure  ( Saussure , 15) , a sign is an object relating a ( phonetic ) form and a ( semantic ) ontent .

5 Though (2) corre , ~ ponds rather well to the traditional pic~ture , it is worth remarking that a more simple hierarchy can be achieved by making phrase  , word , word-base and morpheme subtypes of sign ( in a division different from the autosemantic /synsemantic opposition  ) while making morph and smaller units sub-ciasses of non-sign  . For our purpose , this point is , however , immaterial . 
6 Taken strictly , as it is , the definition does not take into consideration i troflective languages  . This , however , can be remedied simply by reformulating the constraint accord?ingly  .
