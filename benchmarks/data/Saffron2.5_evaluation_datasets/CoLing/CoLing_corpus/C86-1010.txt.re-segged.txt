This paper builds upon and extends certain ideas developed within the framework of Generalized Phrase Structure Grammar  ( GPSG )  . illAnew descriptive device , the Category Cooccurrence Restriction ( CCR )  , is introduced in analogy to existing dev ices of GPSG in order to express constraints on the cooccurrence of categories within local trees  ( i . e . trees of depth one ) which at present are stated with Immediate Dominance  ( ID ) rules and metarules . In addition to providing a uniform format for the statement of such constraints  , CCRs permit generalizations to be expressed which presently cannot be captured in GPSG  . 
Sections l . l and 1 . 2 introduce CCRs and presuppose only a general familiarity with GPSG  . The ideas do not depend on details of GPSG and can be applied to other grammatical formalisms  . 
Sections 1 . 3 - 1 . 5 discuss CCRs in relation to particular principles of GPSG and ass~ne familiarity with Gazdar et al  ( \] . 985) ( henceforth abbreviated ' GKPS') . Finally , section 2 contains proposals for using CCRs to avoid the analyses with metarules given for English in GKPS  . 
1. Category Cooecurrence Restrictions ( CCRs )
I , i The Principle of CCRs
The reasons for proposing CCRs to state rest rictions on the eo occurrence of categories within local trees are analogous to those for introducing Inmlediate Dominance  ( ID ) and Linear Precedence ( LP ) rules in GPSG ( of GEPS , pp .  44-50)  . A contextfree rule binds information of two sorts in a single statement  , namely ( a ) information about which daughters arook has in a local tree and  ( b ) information about the order in which the daughters appear  . 
By separating this information in ID and LP rules  , GPSG is able to state generalizations of the sort " A preceeds B in every local tree which contains both as daughters  , " which cannot be captured in a contextfree grammar  ( CFG )  . 
Now consider an ID rule such as the following  :   ( i ) S - -> A , B , C The fundmnent almotivation for CCRs rests on the insight that such an ID rule itself combines two different kinds of information in a single statement  , namely ( a ) information involving immediate dominance relations  , here that < S , A > ~< S , B > , and < S , C > are ordered pairs of categories in which the first category in mlediately dominates the second and  ( b ) information about the cooccurrence of categories in a single local tree  . 
By distinguishing and separately representing these types of information it becomes possible to state generalizations of the following sort  , which cannot be captured in the ID/LP format : ( 2 ) Any local tree with S as its root must have A as a daughter  . 
(3 ) No local tree with C as a daughter also has Dasadaughter  . 
Statements such as ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) restricting the cooccurrence of categor ies in local trees are Category Cooccurrence Restrictions  , which are expressions of first arder pred icate logic using two primitive pred icates  , R(cx , t ) ' cx is the root of local treet ' and D ( ~ , t ) ' a is a daughter in local tree t ' . \[2\] CCRs have the form Vt : ~ , where 1T : is a schema and the notion of a possible schema is defined as follows:  ( i )   ( R ( a , t )) and ( D(~ , t )) are of form g ; ( it ) if ~ is of form g , then (~) is of form n ; ( ii J ) if Ip and x are both of form I ~ , then ( ~0K r ) is of form ~ , where KC(A , V , D , e ;   ( iv ) constants designating categories occur as first arguments within all coastituent predicate expressions  ;   ( v ) the same variable t bound by the quantifier Vt occurs as second argument within all constituent predicate expressions  ; ( vi ) these are all expressions of form ~ . 
Parentheses may be omitted following the usual conventions in predicate logic  . 
ACCRVt : u may be rewritten in conjunctive normal form as  Vt : ~^  . . . A  ~ , where each clause ot pos lt lve and predicate < Pi is a disjunction  .   . n negated expressions , which is equivalent to Vt : \[ p\]^ . . . AV t : ~, i . e . a conjunction of simple CCRs . -Let 0 , beane ~ pression of form n containing \[ I\]I wish to thank Gerald Gazdar  , Christa Hauenschild , William Keller , Daniel Maxwell , Manfred Pinkal , and Hans Uszkoreit for their comments on earlier versions of this paper  . This work was carried out under the financial support of the BMFT of the German Federal Government  . 
\[2\] Interpretations of R(~ , t ) and D(a , t ) in terms of the theory of feature instantiation in GKPS would be ' the root of local tree t is an extension of ~' and ' some daughter in local tree t is an extension of ~'  . 
50 only the predicate D ; then simple CCRs \[3\] have the following forms : ( 4 ) Vt : R ( ~ , t)\](0' iff a I\[c0\]lVt:00':\]R(~ , t ) iffIko\]l
Vt : ?0' iff I\[0)\]1 iff ~ I\[ . --~ W\]l Quantification is ignored in the notation on the right  ; ~ replaces P ( a , t ) and ~ P ( ~ , t ) and ~- ~ replaces ~ P ( a , t ) giving 0 of rom(0' , where P = R or D . 
The special brackets ' I\[ \]1 ' enclose daughters and render the indication of material implication superfluous  . Using this notation , (2) and (3) may be restated as (5) mid(6) , respectively : ( 5 ) S\[A \] l ( 6 ) I\[C~D\]l To reformulate a set of ID rules we thus need  ( a ) the definition of a set of branches const it uting mother-daughter pairs and  ( b ) an appropriate set of CURs . The definition of branches is permissive in the sense in which ID rules are permiss ive  ( cf GKP S , p . 
76 ) : branches with a conmmn mother can be adjo ined to form a local tree  . CCRs , like the LP rules , which also apply to local trees , are restrictive and limit the class o flocal trees admitted by the grammar  . 
\  [4\] How sets of ID rules may be reformulated in th is manner will be illustrated in the fo llowing section  . 
1.2 Examples of CCRs
GKPS(pp . 47-49) exm , in essets of simple contextfree rules and then proposes strongly equivalent descript ions in ID/LP format  . One set of ID rules resulting from this re formulation is given in  ( 7  )  :  ( 7 ) S->NP , VP VP-~V , VP
S -> AUX , NP , VP VP ~> V , NP
VP->AUE , VP VP->V , NP , VP
The ID rules of ( 7 ) admit local trees whose brancbes are among the following :  ( 8 ) < S , NP > , < S , VP > , < S , AUX > , < VP , V > , < VP , VP > , < VP , AUR > , < VP , NP > Since none of the local trees admitted by  ( 7 ) has more than one occurrence of a given category as daughter  , we may say that the gran ~ ar first admits any strictly linearly ordered set \  [5\] of branches \ [3\] If categories are assumed to be atomic ( e . g . S , NP , V ) rather than complex for the moment , then it is unnecessary to mention more than one root category in a given CCR  , \[4\] Note that the distinction of permissive vs . 
restrictive statements is closely related to that of inherited vs  . instontioted feature specifications in the feature instantiation principles of GPSG  . The theory would appear to gain in simplicity if away could be found to eliminate these distinctions  . 
\[5\] In order to simplify the present exposition , that share a conmmn mother as a local tree . This set of local trees must then be fil tered with appropriate CURs so as to characterize the same set of local trees admitted by  ( 7  )   . 
A single CCR covers the trees with S as root :   ( 9 ) CCR 1: S\]\[NP^VP\]lCUR 1 states that NP and VP are obligatory in any local tree with S as its root  . Since < S , AUX > is also a branch , MIX may optionally occur as daughter in such a tree  . 
To characterize the local trees with VP as root we first construct the following function table:  ( I0 ) linell 0   1 l 1   0   1   1   1   0   1 i 0   1   1 i 0   0 l 0 I 0 I 0   1   0 i 0   0   0 i 0   0   1   0   1  \]  1   0   1   1   0   0  \]  0   0   0   1   0 \] O 0 i 0   0   0 i 0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0 

A " l " under a category ( , n the right side of the table indicates that the category is a daughter in a given local tree  ; "0" means it is absent . If a local tree with the root on the left side of the table and the daughters marked  "1" in a given line is to be admitted by the grarmuar  , then a "1" appears under the root category in the cor responding line  ; "0" indicates that the tree is not admitted . 
A corresponding CCR of the form VPI\[ ( ' ~\]\] can now be formulated , where ( 0 i s a Boo lean express ion in conjunctive normal form  . The terms of co are constructed from the lines designating inadmissible trees as follows :  ( II )  ~ ( AUXAV ) iff ( ~ AUX v ~ V ) lines I ,  2 ,  5 ,  6 ~ ( AUXA ~ VANP ) iff ( ~AIJX vVv~NP )  3 & 7 ~ ( AUXA~VP ) iff ( ' ~ AIIIX v VP )  5 - 8 ~ ( ~ AUXA ~ V ) iff ( AUX vV ) II ,  12 ,  15 ,  16 ~ ( ~ VPA VA~NP ) iff ( VP v ~ V v NP ) \]4&16 The normalized terms of ( I i ) are conjoined in the CUR of ( 12 )  , which is reformulated with conditionals in ( 13 ) and then simplified in ( 14 ) ' . 
(12) VPI\[(~AIIX vNV )^( , -AUX vVv~NP ) A ( ~ AUR v VP ) a ( AUX vV )  ^  ( VP v ~ V v NP ) \]\]  ( 13 ) VP\[\[ ( AUXD~V ) A ( hUX  ~ ( Vv ~ NP ) ) ^  ( AUXDVP ) A ( AUX vV ) A ( V  ~ ( VP v NP )   )  \ ] \ [  ( 14 ) VP\[\[ ( AURe~V ) A ( AUXD ( VPA~NP )   ) A ( V  ~ ( VP v NP ) )\]I l oca l t rees are assumed to conta in than multisets of daughters  . 
sets rather which taken together with ( 8 ) and ( 9 ) admit the same set of local trees as the ID ru les of  ( 7 )  :  ( 15 ) CCR2: VP\[\[AUg~~V\]J
CCR3: VPI\[AUg~(VP^~P ))\] t
CCR4: VP\[\[VD(VPvNP)\]\[
The CCRs of ( 15 ) have been formulated only on the basis of VP trees  , however , and therefore fail to capture generalizat ions that apply to all local trees  . In particular , any local tree with AUX as daughter-regard less of its root-must have a VP as sister  , so CCR3 may be restated as two simpler CCRs , CCR2' and CCR4' , where CCR 2' does not depend on the root category . Furthermore , CCR 4 can be rewritten as CCR 5' since V cannot be a daughter of S . The following final set of CCRs thus emerges : ( 16 ) CORI':S\]\[NPAVP\]\]
CCR2':\]\[AUX ~ VP\]\[
CCR3': VP\]\[AUXe~Y\]\]
CCR4': VP l\[AU?D,--NP\]l
CCR5':\]\[Vm(VPvNP)\]\]
It may first appear that the description with CCRs in  ( 8 ) and ( 16 ) constitutes no clear gain over the ID rules of  ( 7 )   . The latter , however , are highly redundant and express none of the generalizations achieved in  ( 16 )  . Furthermore , the replacement of ID rules with CCRs is the essential prerequisite for the elimination of metarules described in section  2  . 
\].3 The Complement-Type Principle
The ~ ttempt to replace all ID rules with individual CCRs would lead to very complicated descriptions  . Fortunately , the idea of CCRs can be utilized in a general principle that replaces all  . lexJca\]ID rules(i . e . those which have a heat is an extension of a SUBCAT category  ; cf GKP S , p . 
54) , so that only nonleA'ical ID rules need be explicitly reformulated with individual CCRs  . 
Shieber ( 1983 ) and Pollard ( 1985 ) have proposed that a list-or stack-valued feature  ( SYNCAT or SUBCAT ) be introduced whose value contains the complements of a head category  . This paper uses TYP as a syntactic feature with a semantically oriented and lexJ cally determined semantic type as its value  . 
Following the convention of GKPS(p .  189) ,  '<~ , B > ' will be written for < TYP ( ~) , TYP (~) > where ~ and are categories . Given the structure of complex types in GKPS as single-valued functions  , the types may be viewed as lists or stacks . 
A Complement-Type Principle ( CTP ) can now be stated which has the form of a schematic CCR with conditions on variables :  (  \ ]7 )   ( a ) \] IX\[BAR 0 , + H , TYP < 6I ,  < . . . < Sn_l , 5n > . . . >>\]\]1X\[TYP5n\](b)\[IX\[BAR 0 , + H , TYP < 61 ,  < . . . <6 n_l , 6n > . . . >>\] X\[TYP51\]^ . . . ^ X\[TYP5n_l\]^~X\[TYP6'\]\]I where ( i )  5' ~ 61  . . . .  . 5 n_l ;   ( it ) the mother X\[TYP 6n \] and head daughter X\[BAR 0  , + HI are both ~\[ CONJ\] ;  \[6\]  ( iii )   ( a ) and ( b ) are simultaneously fulfilled for ag iven assignment of types to  51  ,   .   .   .   . 5 n_l , 6n for 1 < n . 
CTP allows the complements of a head category to be read off from its semantic type if its mother is known  . According to CTP the lexical head category V\ [SUBCAT  46\] with type < VP\[-AUX , BSE \] , < NP , S >> for the verb do has complement sisters VP\[ -AUX  , BSE \] and NP if its mother is S but has just the complement VP\[-AUX  , BSE \] if its mother is VP , which has the type < NP , S > . The use of CTP in dealing with metarules will be shown in section  2 below , but first another general aspect of the metarule problem must be discussed  . 
1.4 Metaru \] es and Lexical Rules
GKPS introduces not only metarules , e . g . the Passive Metarule(p . 59) and the Extraposition Metarule ( p .  118) , but also related lexical rules involving the same phenomena  , e . g . the Lexieal Rule for Passive Forms ( p .  219 ) and the Lexical Rule for Extraposition Verbs  ( p .  222) . The lexJeal rules are not fully formali zed but all state roughly that if a given lexeme has a certain category  , translation , and semantic type , then a particular form of the lexeme has a corresponding category  , translation , and type . 
Since lexieal rules do most of the work , and given that metarules apply only to Je_vSea JID rules  , it is unclear why both should be needed for what is essentially one job  .   \[7\] CTP in fact allows the reduction of both dev ices  , metarules and lexical rules , to one , here termed ' metalexical ' ( ML ) rules . The latter are schematic rules of the form s = & ~  , where a and 8 are category schemata which may contain variab les in feature values  . Ignoring the semantic translations of lexemes for the present  , a ML rule states that if the lexicon con?a ins an entry assigning ~ to lexe mew  , then it also contains an entry assigning ~ to w  ; morphological rules determine the particu lar word form of w on the basis of syntactic features in the category  . ML rules thus provide for an inductive def inition of the lexicon  . They handle not only phenomena like passive and extrapos J tion but also  , e . g . the subcategorization of sdng with or wi thout an indirect object :  , transitive or intransitive , etc . 
Examples follow in section 2 , but next the entire formalism should be br iefly summarized  . 
\ [6\] The restriction that both categories be ~\ [ CONJ\]  ( i . e . unspecified for CONJ ) is necessary for coordination . In the structural analysis of bought and read books NP is the complement of the V dominating bought and read but not of the 
V dominating read.
\[7\] Uszkoreit (1984, p . 65) has already expressed a similar view . 
52 1.5 Sunmlary of the Formalism
The syntactic formalism proposed here proceeds by describing items  ( feature names and values , feature specifications , categories , and trees ) with statements restricting the dist ribution of lower-level items within next-higher-level items  . Feature nantes and atomic values are primit ives  . Complex feature values are categories or semantic types  . A feature specification is an ordered pai r < f  , v > containing a feature n mnef and value v , where the latter is restricted by the feature-valuer mlge of the former  , h category is a set of feature specific at ions such that no feature name is assigned more than one value  ; it is legaliff it fulfills all Feature Cooccurrence Restrictions  . hlocal tree is an ordered pair consist ing of a legal root category and a list of legal daughter categories such that  ( a ) the Complmnent-Type Principle ,   ( b ) tile Category Cooecurrence Restrictions , and ( c ) tile Feature Instmltiation Principles ( i . e .   , respectively , lexical , nonlexical , and universal statements in the form of CCRs ) as well a stile Linear Precedence statements are fulfilled  .   \[8\] A tree is an ordered pair consisting of a legal root category and a list of daughters  , where each dau ~ , ter is either a tree or a word form . Wordforms and their lexieal categories are specified by tile lexicon  , defined by a list of basic lexical entries and metalexical rules  . 
The gramlmar defines two binary relations over categories  , ID and LP ( the latter constitutiag the Linear Precedence statements  )  . A binary relation R ~ is the extensional closure of R iff for each < ~  , g > in R , R ~ toni:s in severy < y , 6> such that y and 6 are extensions ( oF GKPS , p . 27) of ~ and 6, respectively . 
A local tree with root C and daughters C ~, . . . , C ? .   . o~n must fulfill him condlt lons that < C,C . ~EID = for 1 < i < n and < C . , C . > ~ LPE+(i . e?t~etransitive %-1 . extensionalelo ~ ure of LP ) where 1 < 1 < n1 and j = i + l . 
The proposed formalism utilizes more restr icted memmtilmt GPSG but offers greater possibilities for expressing general i zations  . The eliminat : ion of metarules and the int roduction of CCRs give it at a ore Ii ~ uogeneous struct : are and place cooccurrence restr ictions of various kinds in the center of attention  . 
For the present it may be best to regard this formalism as a particular variant of GPSG since most of tile central notions of the latter are retained  . 
All that is sought is a simplification of GPSG as described in GKPS  . Given the ricll palette of formal . tams recently proposed for kinds of unification gra~mlar ~ it seems rather in genuous to create a new name for thin modification of GPSG  , as thoughtile multitude of remaining open questions were thereby answered  . What we need is a metaformalism that will relate the insights of all the current formalisms through formal invariants preserved under translation from one formalism to another  , and that will then truly deserve a name of its own  . 
\ [8\] The assmnption here is that any work done by t ile Feature Specification Defaults  ( FSDs ) of GKPS can be accomplished with suitably defined FCRs and CC~s  . This will he illustrated in section 2 hut cannot be shown in general in this paper . 
2 . The Elimination of Metarules 2 . 1 Genera l Remarks GKPS a l lows metaru les to be used in ways that intuitively seem undes i rable  . For example , a metarule may simply indicate that . a daughter h of S is optional : ( lS )   ( s -> w , h )  -~  ( s - - ~ w ) The metarule is superfluous if A is enclesed in parentheses in tile corresponding ID rules :  ( 19 ) S --> ( A )  , B , C
S-->(A ), B,D
Single optional elements in the RHS of ID ru les are permitted but have no theoreticals tatus  . Here the generalization is lost , however , that A is optional in all expansions of S . 
The Complement ~ , ission Metarule proposed in GKPS(p . 124) is similar : (20)\[+ N , BAR1\]--bH , W\[+N , BAR1\] . eHT h is metarule can be avoided \[9\] by simply adding tile target of the metarule to the set of base TD rules :  ( 21 )  \ [  , N , Bhl ~ 1\] ~HBut the formalism of GKPS does not permit more than one clement  , to been closed in parentheses , so the following canno the an II ) rule: ( 22 ) S - ~ A , ( B , C ) Aside from the use of parentheses to indicate single optional elements  , none of tile ahh reviatory conventions proposed in Chomsky/Hal\]e  (  1968 , pp . 
393-399) are enlployed in GPS(\] . Thus , the rules of ( 19 ) cannot be abbreviated with braces as in ( 23 ) :  ( 23 ) s -> ( A )   , B ,  (
C )

Since such abbreviatory conventions for express ing coocurrence restrictions are not p rovided by GPSG  , it . 
is not ~ . mr prising that timir work is assumed by metarules  . GEPS in fact , ! ~ tates that metarules " amount to notifing more than a novel type of rule-collapsing convention for rules "  ( p .  66) . 
Now that CCRs have been presented above insect ion  1  . 2 fo r res ta t ing a s imp le GPSG t l la t does not contain metarules  , we Call examine low they may be used tOe\]in linate metarules fram the GPSG proposed for

53 2.2 The Passive Metarule
GKP8(p .  59 ) presents a Passive Metarule ( PM ) of remarkable simplicity and generality :   ( 24 ) VP-->W , NP
VP\[PAS\]-@W,(PP\[by\])
PM states that for every lexical ID rule expanding VP and containing NP and any multi set W of categories in the RHS  , there is a corresponding lexical ID rule expanding VP\[PAS\] and optionally contain ingPP\[by\]inplace of NP in its RHS  . Although the head V dominated by VP\[PAS\] is not mentioned in PM  , it must be specified < VFOEN ~ PAS > in a local tree by virtue of the Head Feature Convention  . 
As noted in section 1 . 4 , however , PM does only a small part of the work for passive  , the main task " falling to the Lexical Rule for Passive Forms  . 
Moreover , some of the predictions of PM are incorrect . Thus , PM applies to the lexical ID rule introducing V\ [SUBCAT  20\]  , to which bother belongs : ( 25 ) VP\[AGRS\]-->HI20\] , NPB ut the derived ID rule for V\[20 , PAS \] incorrectly allows a PP\[PFORM by \] complement  . \[10\]Furthermore , sentences like That Santa Claus exists . is believed by Kim . are grammatical , but PM does not : apply to the lexical ID rule introducing V\[SUBCAT  40\] for beldt : . ve:(26) VP-->H\[40\] , S\[FIN\]Let PAS be a Boolean-valued feature restricted to \[+ V  , -N\] categories . Then we may state the following
Metalexical Rule for Passive Forms : (27) V\[-PAS , AGR6 n , TYP < 61 , < .   .   . < 6n_l , <6n , S > > .   .   . >>lgV\[+PAS , AGR6n_l , TYP < 6~I , <61, < . . . < 6n_i , S > . . . >>>\] and V\[+PAS , AGR6n_\], TYP 461, < . . . < 6n_\], S > . . . >>\] where ( i ) 6n-l'6n 6NP , S and ( ii ) : if 6= NP then 6': PP\[by\]else6'=S . 
nnn
Note that 6 , and 6 are the categories of the --1 . n direct , object ! and subject of V\[-PAS\] , respectively . 
By CTP V\[-PAS \] with mother VP ( of type < 6 , S >) has complements 6 ,   .   .   .   .  6  , while V\[+PAS \] nithmother VP ( of type < ~ , , S >) hnsleomplements 6 .   .   .   .   . , 6n-t , ln-z and , opt * onally , 6n . 
\[I0\]V\[PAS \] is specified < SUBCAT , 2> in , h ~ n was both ered ~ Y h is boss . 
2 . 3 The ' Subject-Aux Inversion ' ( SAI ) Metarule The second metarule for English discussed in GEPS is the ' Subjeet-Aux Inversion '   ( SAI ) Metarule ( pp . 
60-65):(28) V2\[-SUBJ\]"-->W
V2\[+INV , + SUBJ\]--~W,NP
This applies to all lexical ID rules expanding VP.
\[ II\]Because of (29) , however , local trees are admitted only by derived IB rules produced by its application to base lexical ID rules expanding categories specified VP\[+AUX\] :   ( 29 ) \[+ INV\]=\[+AUX , FIN\] ( FCR1 ) Most of the work of this metaru \] e can be taken care of simply by the CTP since a lexical head Y with the type  <6 I ,  < . . . < 6n , < hiP , S > > . . . >> has the complements 61, . . . , 6 if its mother is VP ( of type < NP , S >) and he complements & l'''''6 n , NP if the mother is S . Further restrictions must determine when V has which mother  . In addition to the FCRs of (29) and (30) , retained from GKPS , the new FCR of (31) is introduced : (30)\[+ INV , BAR2\]D\[+SUBJ\] ( FCRI 0 )   ( 31 ) \[ INV\]~\[+V , -N\]INV is a HEAD feature subject to the Head Feature Convention  ( cf GKP S , pp .  94-99) , so a V 2 mother of V\[+INVJ must be specified < INV , +> and therefore also < SUBJ ,  +> . If V is specified < INV ,  ->  ( note that ( 31 ) requires it to have some specification for INV )  , then its mother is * lot an extension of V2 ( providing for coordination ) or it is specified < SUBJ , -> according to the following CCR : ( 32 ) I\[V\[-INV\]31 ( ~ V2v\[-SUBJ\] ) \[12\] Although GKPS provides for , an embedded inverted sentence in WhatdJd you see ?  , no embedded nonhead S is specified < INV ,  +> . This fact is captured with a CCR : ( 33 )   ( \[~ S\[-H , + INV\] \]1 A special Feature Specification Default to account for the distribution of INY  ( cfCKPS , pp . 30-31) then becomes unnecessary . 
\[ ll\]\[12\]
Recall the use of aliases in GKPS(p .  61 ) whereby ' VP ' stands for V2\[-SUBJ \] and ' S'for

Note that this CCR contains a disjunction of root descriptions and thus does not conform to the schemata for simple CCRs with atomic categories presented in section  1  . 1 above . The disjunction is to here ad " the root is not an extension of V  2 or it is an extension of \[- SUBJ\] . "GKPS(p .  118 ) proposes the following metarule to handle extraposition :  ( 34 ) X2\[AGRS\]-->W#
X2\[AaRNP\[it\]\]-->W,S
The metarule correctly predicts sentences like . It bothers John that Kint drinks , because it applies to the lexical IB rule introducing V\[SUBCAT  20\] for bother : ( 35 ) W\[A ( mS\]-->II\[ZO\] , Nr To allow It " is s_lppa , rent that Kim drinks .   , however- , it must also apply to the icxical IB rule introducing

As in GKPS , an FCR requires that a category specified < NUI , L , +> also be specified for SLASH : ( 41 ) \[+ NULL L\]~\[SLASH\] ( FCR 19 ) The distribution of SI , ASt I is in turn governed by the CAP , HFC , and FFP . GKPS also postulates an FSD for
NULl , : (42) ~\[ NULL\](FSD3)
Fg D 3 is not required in tills analysis since categories specified < BAR  , 2 > are freely specified with values from (4 , - for NUL l , , while all other categories must he unspecified for NULL according to  ( 39 )  . 
The treatment of gaps in GKPS is completed with the SlashTermination Metarule  2   ( STM2 )   ( cf GKP S , pp . 
160:162):(43) X-->W,V2\[+SUBJ,FIN\]
X/NP->W,vP\[-sUBJ\]
S ~'M2 says that for every \] exical ID rule introducing V ~\ [+ SUBJ  , FIN\]as a daughter , there is a corresponding rule with V2\[-SUBJ , FIN\] in place of V2\[~SUBJ , FIN\] and with the mother specified < SLASI , NP > . 
Examination of the lexical \] D rules proposed for English in GKI  ) S reveals that all @\[ FIN\]daughters in t roduced are also specified < SUBJ  ,  +> . We may therefore reformulate tim types of the \] exical head cat  . egories o that V 2\[FIN \] complements do not carry the specific at ion < SUBJ  ,  +> . The feature SUBJ is then freely specified but restricted by the FCR in  ( 44 ) and the CCR in ( 45 ) :  ( 44 ) \[SUBJ\]r ~\[- ~ V , -N , lIAR2\](/15)1\[\[BAR0\]^V2\[-SI , JI'IJ , FIN\]\]1 X/NP The CCR of (4 . 5) states that a local tree with V2\[-SUBJ , FIN\]and\[BA itO\]as daughters must have a root specified < SLASII  , NP > . As : in the case of STM\] , the stipulation of a\[BARO\]sister is the CCR counterpart of the requirement hat metaru \] es apply only ? o lexical IBru les  . 
Taken together , the two FCRs of ( 39 ) and ( 44 ) plus the two CCRs of ( 40 ) and ( 45 ) accomplish all the work of STM1 and STM2 and result in the same analyses for
English as adopted in GKPS.
