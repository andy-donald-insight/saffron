The first very large volume of modern Chinese concordances  ( two sets of one million-line KWIC index ) has been compiled and materialized automatically with a modified kanji printer for Japanese  . 

This paper describes an experiment to compile Chinese concordances automatically  . A very large volume of KWIC indexes for modern Chinese  ( one million lines per set ) has been compiled successfully with a kanji printer for Japanese  . 
This paper discusses the purposes of the experiment  , selection and input of the Chinese data , some statistics on Chinese characters ( vs . 
kanji ) and the concordance compilation process.
Finally , examples from the computer-generated concordances are shown  . 
THE PURPOSES
The idea of machine-processing modern Chinese data originally came from Professor Yuen Ren Chao  , Agassiz Professor Emeritus of Oriental Languages at the University of California at Berkeley  , before one of the authors ( Hashimoto ) took over the directorship of the Princeton Chinese linguistics project  . Chaoserved as the chief of the advisory committee to the project since its foundation  . The idea , in short , was : so much has been said about the Chinese pai -hua-wen--a written language of modern China-- yet nobody has ever clarified what it really was  , i . e . ; what the basic vocabulary was , what the major syntactic structure was , etc . : in other words the every detail of the reality of pai-hua-wen  . Certain quantitative surveys were done before us , but even the most extensive one in those days was based on data consisting of no more than  i00  , 000 characters . In addition , the selection was very poorly done--most of the materials were primary school text books  . We did not believe that school text books reflected the reality of the language  , even in its written form . We chose one digit more than the previous one , namely 1 , 000 , 000 characters , though for various reasons , the actual data contained in our tape include several thousands more than one million \[ i  ,  2\] . 
After completion of the computer input and editing of the million-character file at Princeton  , researches towards statistical aspects of the data have been conducted  \[4\]  . As stated in \[4\] , tables of character frequency can tellus various aspects of the Chinese  , such as the basic character set , transient states of character strings and so on . This can be summarized as the first step of computer-processing modern Chinese data  . However , in order to understand the reality of a language , besides statistics , concordances are the necessities which illustrate the contexts where and how those characters are used  . 
On the other hand , computer applications to Chinese have very limited background so for  . No computer-generated concordances on Chinese have been reported yet  . Thus the concordance genaration project would not only be valuable to the understanding of Chinese pai-hua-wen  , but also contribute to the development of the methodology to manipulate Chinese automatically  . 
Consequently , a project to compile concordances of the Princeton million-character file was conducted at the Electro technical Laboratory during  1977-1979  . This constitutes the second important stage of computer-processing modern 

THECHINE SEDATA
The Input of the Original Data
The first phase of the data input was done in Taiwan during  1969-1972 with a Chinese character keyboard , designed by Cheng Chin Kao--a Chinese teletype Machine  ( manufactured by the OkiDenki Co . , Ltd . ) . The code was converted into the Chinese standard telegraphic code in Walthum  , Massachusetts at a computer company . 
The greatest difficulty , in addition to ordinary proofreading , consisted in the conversion of the socalled " combination characters " of the C  . C . Kaosystem : any character not found in the Kao keyboard was punched so that part of it  ( normally the " radical " ) was represented by a character having the same radical in the keyboard  , and another by a character having the same " signific "  . Necessary flags were of course attached to these " combination characters "  , yet the key punchers selected those constituent characters quite at random  , sometimes --323-disregarding the position of a radical within a character , so that the results were often a hopeless mess . 
The Selection of the Data
It was tried , at the selection of the data , to cover every conceivable category and style of writings in China since her modernization  , the socalled May 5Movement period , from ordinary novels to philosophical writings , from political speeches to newspaper articles , etc . etc . These categories and styles were classified and were assigned appropriate marks to show the genre  . 
The partial list of these writings follow : ~ , ~: ~/ Q~\[~~:~:-y . ~~: ~' ~: f . 
I~:~~~:~t~A~:~~i ~!: T~~:~P~~:~ t ~ T ~ : ~ : ~ For a complete list of all these writings and of the genre marks  , see\[3\] . All the proper nouns were so marked , as they may not correctly contribute to any statistical measurement of the written language except for these proper nouns themselves  . These nouns were marked in the original texts by research assistants with enough command of the language to make correct judgment  . Anything else , including punctuation marks of all sorts , in the texts were properly processed . Every sentence , including some vocative phrases , was numbered within the writing piece quite mechanicaly  , though occasionally it was necessary for specialists to make certain judgment for segmenting sentences  . 
The Code System
The Chinese standard telegraphic code system includes some  9500 codes for Chinese characters . 
A code consists of a set of 4 digits , which represents one Chinese character . Among those 9500,5231 have been used . 

Statistical analysis of this million-character file can be found in  \[4\]  . Some additional statistics are provided here . Fig .   1 shows the i0 most frequently used characters with their frequencies  . These I0 characters occupy 17 . 1% of the total amount . Fig . 2 is a table of character frequencies vs . the number of character types . Fig .   3 shows the cumulative percentage of character occurrences as a function of the number of character types  ( in descending order of frequency )  . It indicates , for example ) only 92 characters represent 47% of the entire data . There are 1170 characters each Of which are used more than I00 times and they occupy 92  . 8% of the whole data .

CHINESE CHARACTERS VS . KANJI
Chinese characters were imported into Japan sometime in the  5th century ? Since then , they have been extensively used with a few additional characters created in Japan  ( this modified set of Chinese characters is called " kanji "  )  , although hiragana and katakana ( two sets of pure Japanese characters with their original so in the forms of Chinese characters  ) were invented early in the 9th century . 
" Chinese characters for daily use " established by the Ministry of Education for modern Japanese includes a  18S0 kanjis et , however several thousand more are still in use especially for proper nouns  . The Japanese Industrial Standard ( JIS ) " Code of the Japanese Graphic Character Set for Information Exchange  ( C 62 26 ) "established in 1978 includes a 6349 kanjis et , hiragana , katakana , Roman alphabet , Greek letters , Russian letters and other symbols . The kanjiset is grouped into 2 levels , the first level a 2965 kanjiset and the second level a 3384 kanjis et . This means some 3000 kanji are considered to be enough for basic information exchange in Japanese  . In this experiment , the kanji printer system T4 100i .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .

Number of Character Types ( Syowa Zyoho , Co . , Ltd . ) was used . A total of 8182 characters was available for this printer including  7360 kanji , hiragana , katakana , Roman alphabet , and other miscellaneous symbols . The system was developed 5 years before the establishment of JIS C6226  . 
As mentioned before , the million-character file included 5231 different Chinese characters ? Among them , 295 were found to be unprintable ( because they were not found in the T4100 system )  . The fonts of those 295 characters were designed and incorporated into the  T4100 system . 
Later , when JISC 6226 was established , some of those 295 characters were found in the second level of the kan~is et  , namely ~( frequency 773) ,  ~(581) ,  ~'(563) ,  ~(345) , -~(343) ,  ~189)  , ~(178)  , and . ~%(158) . Fig .   4 shows the frequency of the remaining 287 characters . 
Their total frequency numbers II00, which is 0 . 1% of the million-character file . This fact indicates that Chinese characters and kanji still overlap closely in modern Chinese and Japanese  .   ( It should be noticed that the simplified Chinese characters are out of this scope since they did not exist at the socalled 
May 5Movement period.)
THECONCORDANCES
Besides the text itself , the Princeton million-character file contained information on the title  , the author , the sentence numbers , and other miscellaneous editorial symbols ( such as

After this editorial step and incorporation of Chinese character fonts to the  T4100 kanji printing ststem , the concordance compilation process was started . Since we have had experience with the automatic compilation of one-million line concordances in Japanese\[S\]  , not many technical difficulties were encountered , except some malfunctions of our old kanji printer  . Discussions on the salient features of those Chinese concordances follow  . 
Key Words
KWIC index style has been adopted as the form of Chinese concordances  , since it is one of the most fundamental styles for computer-generated concordances ? Because there is no clear segmentation of words in Chinese  , and because one character represents a fairly sizable amount of information  , each character was chosen as a " keyword " . Furthermore , no elimination of " non-keywords " were made . Every character ( including punctuation ) was chosen as a key character . In this sense , the concordance may he named as " All characters in context " index  . 
Consequently , one million character data required one million lines of index  . 

One of the deficiencies of the KWIC index style is that the context each line can show is limited to its line length  . We could afford 55 characters for the context . Since one or two Chinese characters represent a word  , this length can accommodate more than 30 words of information in English . 
Reverse Sorted Index
Two types of KWIC index have been produced . One is for the normal type , in which all lines are sorted in the ascending order of the Chinese standard telegraphic code of key characters  ( plus 7 succeeding characters )  . Fig . 6 shows an example page from this type of index . The other is the socalled " reverse sorted " index  . The major key for this type is the same as that of the normal type  . The minor sort keys are , the characters immediately preceding the major key  . 
Thus all lines for one key character are listed in the ascending order of the code for the character immediately preceding the key character and so on  . Fig .   7 shows an example page from the reverse sorted concordance  . 
CONCLUDING REMARKS
The two sets of modern Chinese concordances can be reached at the National Inter-university Research Institute of Asian and African Languages and Cultures  , Tokyo University of Foreign Studies . It should be noted that a concordance of one million lines amounts to over  25  , 000 pages ( actually it counts for 27 , 341) or 50 volumes of a 5cm-width paper file . Before printing the whole index , engineers recommended linguists to use COM technique  , but invain . A microfic heversion should have been produced for portability  . Analysis of the concordances have just got off the ground  . The resulting papers are expected to follow .
