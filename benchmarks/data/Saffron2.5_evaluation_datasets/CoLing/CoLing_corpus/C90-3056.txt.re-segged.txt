A framework for the description of syntactic structures of free word order languages is proposed  , based on combination of intuitions underlying immediate constituent description  , dependency description and communicative dynamism  . The combined approach is compared to its sources and shown superior in descriptive power  , esp . in the area of free intermixing of ( any number of ) adjuncts with complements and in coordination . Close resemblance to two other recent approaches is pointed out  . 
I . Syz~tactic Structures for Free Word Order The absolute majority of current linguistic frameworks characterize syntactic structures of natural languages in predominantly static terms  , paying only minimal or no attel ~ tion to the communicative functionef language and its ref lection in the process of utterlng /understandlng  ( generation/parsing ) sentences . 
In the case of generative frameworks based on i ~ nedlate constituent approaches to  . language de-scr~ptlon , this can be ascribed ( at least partly ) to the fact that many of them ( GB , LFG , GPSG , TAGS , to mention the most widespread ones ) were created prima-rlly for the sake of description of English  , a highly configur at lonal language in which the impact of communicative functions on syntactic structure is quite limited  ( at least in comparison with the so-ca!-led free -word-order languages-henceforth FWOLs  )  . 
The frameworks based on the dependency syntax ( e . g . , the " Meaning-Text " model of Mel'chuk and Apre -syan  , the " Functional Generative Description " of Sgall et al  , the " Word Grammar " of Hudson ) , on the other hand , by the very principle separate linguistic structures from the process of generation/parsing so sharply that even if any reflection of the communicative process is present in the generation/parsing procedures  , it gets lost in the resulting structures and has to be added there  ( if needed ) more or \] essartifi-cially , e . g . , in the form of different indices ( cf . 
the structures in Sgalletel , 1986).
This lack of reflection of communicative aspects of language in the  ( syntactic ) structures , together with still other features of the abovementioned frameworks  ( such as , for the immediate constituent based approaches , the incapability of the standard " S-->NP VP " approach to describe  , e . g . , the +' Object-Subject-Verb " constltuent order , or this obstacle overcome in some way , the problems connected with free intermixing of any number of free adjuncts among the complements  , and , for the dependency based approaches , the problems involved in capturing even quite simple instances of coordination  )  , make relatively profound adjustments in the exist ing frameworks or development of a new one a necessary and highly important task if a language involving broad impact of the communicative aspects on its syntactic structures  ( such as the FWOLs ) has to be described formally in such a way that the description can be directly implemented on a computer and function as a generator or a parser  . 
The easiest way how to overcome the difficultles connected with the current frameworks and to achieve the abovementioned goal of creating a framework suitable for a reasonable description of FWOLs as well as for an easy and efficient computer implementation seemed to be to augment the immediatee on stltuent ba-sed nontransform at lonal approaches  ( which are easier to implement due to the clearcut correspondence between the rules of the grammar and the structures they generate  ) with tile in tultions contained in more traditional descriptions of the FWOLs as well as in the descriptions of functional sentence perspective and com ~ municatlve dynamism  ( Fir has , 1971 , 1975; Sga ! letai , 1973) . 
In the unmarked case , the scale of co~nunicative dynamism allows for splitting the sentence or arty of its parts on the level of the " main " constituel \] ts  ( such as Subject , Object , different verbal Adjuncts etc . ) at any moment into two parts , the first con+sisting of the constituent being processes  ( uttered , expanded ) at the very moment , i + e . the currently least dynamic constituent , and the second one consisting of the " rest " of the sentence  , i . e . of all the consti~tuents more dynamic than the currently processed one  . 
This results in a non-transformational accounc of syntactic structures  , in the form of binary right-branch-ing trees ( if the division sketched above is broadened to all constituent types used in the description  )  . Art example of the structure for the notorious sentence " John loves Mary " is given in  ( I )  .   ( Mind the rightmost " RestS " nonterminal dominating an empty string : " nothing more is to " be uttered " in the sentence  , "nothing is more dynamic " than " Mary " . )( I )

On such an approach , both the generation of all possible constituent orders and free intermixing of any number of adjuncts between any two complements is guaranteed for FWOLs  , and this without ~ slng the Kleene star in the rules  , metaru \] es generating an infinite number of rules or any other way o ~ using  ( explicitly or implicitly ) an infinite rule set . Just on the contrary , the approach results in a drastic simplification of the number and shape of rules needed : one gross rule scheme  ( 2 ) is sufficient for the whole grammar : ( 2 ) ~ ~ at is to be 1 \[ be expanded Jl expanded NO ~ A In this scheme , the second constituent on the righthand side is always the phrasal head  ; accozding to the nature of the left daughter , the rule set can be furt-her factorized into the following subsets reflecting the classicall inguistic wisdom : ru\]es expanding the lexical head  , rules expanding a complement , rules expanding a free adjunct , rules expandi~g an extraposed constituent , rules expanding a member of a coordinated structure  , rules expanding minor categories ( conjunctions , particles etc . . Such a division is im-1   311   portan5 not only because it brings along some more purity and perspicuity  , but also because it allows for a straightforward implementation of different feature inheritance principles of the framework  ( such as the Head Feature Principle , Subcategorization Principle etc . ) in the computer variant of the grammar ; on a reasonable formal notation of the grammar rules allowing marking off the type of the rule as the pro-perty of the rule itself  , it is possible to bound the application of the principles to the whole rule types rather than to each rule separately  , as the case often is in many current parsers ( e . g . , for a head daughter in a rule , it is not necessary to stipulate explicitly the sharing of its head features with the mother  , since this is provided for by listing the rule in the class of head expanding rules  )  . 
2 . Relation to other Syntactic Frameworks The proposed structures might seem rather unconvention alat first glance  ; however , their relation to structures used in more usual syntactic frameworks can be shown to be quite straightforward in simple cases  . All what is needed to obtain dependency trees is to factorize the set of nodes of the describ-ed structures by all bar projections of a single terminal node  . An X-structure can be obtained by facto-rizing the set of nodes by projections of the same bar ~level of a single terminal node  . 
In more complicated cases , however , the factorizations sketched above cannot be performed  . 
Exactly in these cases , the structures proposed rank better in describing at least the following phenomena of FWOLs : in relation to dependency syntax  ( tradi-tionally used for description of FWOLs )  , first of all in describing coordination , but also the socalled non-proJect lve constructions  ( e . g . , unbounded dependencies ) as well as cases where contact position of certain words or constituents is required or positions are to be strictly fixed even in FWOLs  ( e . g . , the Wac-kernaGel's posit ion of clitlcs ) , which both is difficult to achieve in dependency descriptions if non-pro-jective constructions are allowed to occur since these ~ nter fere with the " basic " projective ordering generated-in relation to standard variants of X-syn-tax  , the approach adopted solves the problems with the position of subject  , with free intermixing of complements and adjuncts and  , in addition , it is able to cope with certain cases of " heavy " coordination  ( see below ) on a contextfree basis . 
3. suboategorization and Coomdinatlon
Generally speaking , the intuitions ( as opposed to the formalism ) standing behind the framework are very close to ( if not the same as ) those supporting dependency approaches ( certainly more so than to the intultions of the majority of current immediate constituent approaches  , cf . , e . g . , the nonexistence of the " NP/VP " division of a sentence  )  , but the structures developed for the formal incarnation of these intuitions have by far more descriptive power than the standard formalizations proposed for the dependency approaches  . This extra power ( even in comparison with the standard X -approaches  ) stems mainly from the increased number of nonterminal symbols : the greater number of nonterminals allows for a more subtle struc-tul lng of the terminal string  . 
The crucial point of this refinement of structu -ralinformation is the one concerning subcategorization of phrases  . In accordance with the treatment of subcategorization in HPSG and other fra-meworks r subcategorization can be informally viewed as the number and shape of constituents to be added to a particular phrase for it to become a saturated projection of its lexical head  ( e . g . , for a VP , this subca-tegorizatlon is the number and shape of constituents to be added for the VP to become a sentence  ; thus , a sentence is Just an alias for a VP with empty subcategorization  )  . In the example (3) , it is important to notice the " sharing " of the subcategorizatlon requirements  ( depicted schematically assets of subcate -gorlzed-for elements associated with the nonterminal nodes of the structure  ) between the lexlcal head of the sentence ( the verb ) and its rlghtmost phrasal projection , as well as the step wlse right-to-left reduction of the subcategorization requirements of the VP ' s  , and also the fact that the expansion of a lexi -colheador a free adjunct does not affect the subca-tegorization  .

As mentioned above , this " extra descriptive po-wer " can be made use of for descriptlon of  ( among other ) certain " heavy " coordinations . The instances we have in mind are " RightNode Raising " and " A cross the Board " coordinations exemplified in  ( 4 ) and ( 5 )  , respectively .

Before presenting the treatment proper , two matters have to be pointed out :- first , in FWOLs " Right Node Raising " and " Across the Board " are exactly the same cases of coordinative constructions  ( due to the free-word-order , the position of the " extracted " constituent plays no syntactic role  ) -second , the grammaticality of other cases of coordination can be order dependent  , even in FWOLs : typical case is " Gapping " ( of . the contrast shown for English in (6) a , b but holding also in ( at least ) Bulgarian , Czech , Polish , Russian and Slovak ) , somewhat unclear is the situation with " N on -Constituent Coordination "  , where speakers of the sbovementioned ! an-guages seem to have different opinions about the grammaticality of the respective counterparts of  ( 7 ) b .

(7) a . John gave a book to Mary and a bunch off lowers to Sue  . 
b . ? ? A book to Mary and a bunch off lowers to Sue John gave  . 
This corroborates the view that (6) a , (7 ) a are instances of some extragrammatl cal communicative processes  ( i . e . processes not reflected in the grammar of the language-such as the tendency to avoid uttering identical parts of coordinated structures etc  . ) rather than true cases of " coordinated predication " which seems to be the case with " Right Node Raising " and " A cross the Board "  . 
The treatment of " Right Node Raising " and " Across the Board " relies fully on the refinement of subcategorization into the increased number of nodes of the structure  , but on the other hand it does not require any augmentation of the coordination mechanisms of the framework  , the only coordination rule being the " coordination of likes "  . The approach even allows for description of constructions where " Right Node Raising " and " Across the Board " cooccur  . The structure assigned to such cases is given in ( 8 )   ( the terminal string of which is quite probably no good English  , but translations into the FWOLs tested are considered fully acceptable  )  .

Partly also as an indireet support 2 forth ( ~for ma-lism presented , it is further necessary to say that structures in many respects similar were proposed independently in  ( Uszkorelt , \ ]986 for the descrlptlen of " complex fronting " in verb-final C <  . ~in anc ! at Jsc~s and in ( Gun Ji , i987) in the framework ( if JPSC ( which , how--ever , advocates the existence of the " NP/VP"d~vls\[c : of the sentence and also  , slmilarly to Uszke ~ e . it , hea-vily relies on the faet than Japanese is a verb-final language  )   .
