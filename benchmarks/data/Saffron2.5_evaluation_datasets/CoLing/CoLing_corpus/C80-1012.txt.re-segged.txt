Word semantics is gaining increasing interest within linguistics in view of both  , more adequate representational structures of the semantic system and methods and procedures to analyse it empirically  . Due to the fact formal and operational means have been devised to describe and represent word connotation and/or denotation  , this paper discusses some of the empirical problems connected with natural languages ' vary ing and vague meanings  , how these can be analysed statistically from discourse data  , and represented formally as fuzzy system of vocabulary mappings  . Some examples computed from East - and West- German newspaper texts will be given at the end to illustrate the approaches feasi-bi lity  . 
I . Introduction
When we look up linguistic theories of sentence -or even of text-semantics to see what they can offer in respect to word-meaning  , we will be confronted with basically two types FILL MORE  /3/ has referred to as checklist-semantics and prototype-semantics  . According to this distinction , checklist-semantics provides listings of meaning components  , semantic markers , or semantic descrip-tors which must be satis fied for a term to be  ( grammatically , truth-function-all y , or else ) interpretable within a linguistic express ion  ; whereas proto-type-semantics allows for the ( pa~g-ma ~ l , Syn~agmatical , or else ) iden-tification of a term as part of al inguistic expression within a networks t ructure of labeled nodes and relations  . 
Examining how these listings and networks are assembled  , i . e . questioning from which sources and by what procedures the data necessary for their composi tion were acquired  , we will invariably come accross the indiv idual analysts '  , or group of analysts ' own assumedly comprehens ive and reliable knowledge of the world and /or the natural language system concerned  . In the majority of cases , these will not have been made accessible by inter-subjectively defined operations but rather by way of intuitive introspec-tion  . In doing so , linguists tend to make use of word-meaning instead of analysing it when they setup matri ces for componential analysis or define semantic networks  . Apart from tentative departures within generative semantics or statistical indexing  , there have no operational procedures yet been devised for the semantic analysis and descrip -tion of natural language terms as a result of which-when applied to natural language di scourse-a lexical structure may be obtained  . 
Now , this is what word-semantics should and could do  , and where exactly the problems begin . 
2. Ep is tomology
If we agree that linguistics is , or at least ought to be , an empirical discipline , then the paradigm of empi-rical sciences should be followed  , although it needs modification in view of the scope of natural language semantics  . 
To adopt the paradigm of empirical sciences for linguistic research is tantamount to at least two postulates : a  ) not to rely on ready made theories or models taken from another domain  , because these may be inadequate in respect to the phenomena under investigation  ; and exploration of one's own knowledge and competence as the allegedly in-exhaustible data source although va-luable initial ideas might be prod-uced that way  . 
Instead , the investigation of linguistic problems in general  , and that of word-semantics in particular , should start with hypotheses formulated for continuous estimation and/or testing against observable data  , then proceed to incorporate the findings tentatively in some preliminary theoretical set up which finally may perhaps get formalized to become part of an encompassing theory  . 
Within such a setup , the formal expressions which give an abstract representation of the domain  , and the numerical expressions which give a quantitative account of the observable data  , are normally to be complemented by correspondence rules  . 
These allow for the operational interpretation of formal notations and theoretical constructs in terms of empirical methods of counting and measuring observable data  . Linguistic theory has not been interested too much in developing correspondence rules of that kind so far  /15/  . 
Following the line of LABOV/9/ and LEECH/10/ , prevailing linguistic theory and linguistic semantics in particular is dominated by what has been called the " categorial view " According to it  , linguistic entities are at least implicitly asserted to be discrete  , invariant , qualitatively distinct , conjunctively definable , and composed of atomic primes . Membership in categories , and relations of inclusion and exclusion among units and categories  , are established by a deterministic type of rule that allows only for binary  ( positive or negative ) or triple ( positive , negative , or optional ) assignment , but has no means to represent probable and/or possible degrees of transition  . This type of rule-particularly when employed for meaning representation purposes-has come undersevere criticism from as seemingly disparate disciplines like cognitive theory  ( e . g . /12/) and experimental psychology ( e . g . /20/), information and computer science ( e . g . /23/,/4/), psycholinguistics ( e . g . /16/,/11/), sociolinguistics ( e . g . /8/,/7/, computational semantics ( e . g . /14/), and artificial intelligence ( e . g . 

From the increasing amount of strong empirical evidence piling  , up in favour of some re-adjustment , a ( meta-theore-tical ) modification appears to be overdue . Accordingly , it may be argued that-contrary to the experimentally and simulatively well established  ( object-theoretical ) fuzziness of cognitive categorizing and its l inguis-tic correspondences - any formal re  , presentation of it using only binary systems ' notations will inevitably result in inadequately sharp-edged lattices  . When imposed upon the varying and vague structures constituted and modified continuously during the process of verbal communication observed to be modelled  , this will render formal representations of discrete entities with clearcut boundaries where blurred margins and continuous transitions would be adequate  . 
The modifications suggested so far may be summarized to concern both  , the observable manifestation and/or formal representation of discourse  , allowing gradual rather than abrupt transitions to account for imprecise phenomena in a precise way  . This can be achieved , as I see it , formally by means of fuzzy set theoretical notations  /24/  , and operationally by means of empirical procedures assigned to them  /19/  . Applied to natural language data , they will interrelate observable but essential lyfuzzy language phenomena on the one hand  , and formal but finally categorial notations of their linguistic descriptions on the other  . 
Thus , findings and/or hypotheses on either side may become testable against each other  , allowing for mutual modifi-cations in the course of gradual improvement and increasing adequacy of the model and what it represents  . 
3. Structure of Meaning
What makes the analysis of natural language meaning so intricate a problem depends on the particular nature of what has to be represented as its results  , namely , a representational structure in its own . It is this re-presentational aspect of language which theories of semantics and cognition have been  , and still are focussed on in particular . 
According to the more traditional theories , natural language meaning can be characterized by its denotative and connotative aspects  . Denotation is understood to constitute referential meaning as a system of relations between words or sentences of a  --77 language and the objects or processes they refer to  . Connotation is defined to constitute structural meanings as a system by which words or sentences of a language are conceptually re & a ted to one another  . Referential semantic theory is truth-funct ional and formally elaborated but as such not prepared to account satisfactorily for the vagueness of natural language meaning  ; whereas structural semantics has con-sidered vagueness somewhat fundamental of language but  , being based mainly upon intuitive introspect ion  , it has not achieved the theoretical or me -thodological consistency of formal theories  . 
In the course of recent , more pro-cedural approaches to cognition and language comprehension  , the former dis-tinction of referential and structural meaning was embedded in what became to be known as frame semantics  /17/  . The central notion of it is that of memory which serve as a paradigm for the op-erational aspects of both  , world system structures and language system structures  . The basic distinction of what may proposi tionally be formulated as opposed to what may only prototypi-cally be realized in some system structure of stored experiences  , is reflec-ted in the great variety of not ional pairings which different discipl in es have produced facing a similar  , if not identical research problem . Thus , their notions of formal vs . experient ? alknowledge/2/, semantic vs . episodic memory/21/, frame vs . scene / 3/, description vs . schema/I /, etc . show a striking resemblance : although their approaches differ in what they consider natural language meaning to be  , they nontheless converge on the central notion of it  , being a relation between a representation ( i . e . the body of discourse ) and that which it represents ( i . e . a referentially and/or prototypically def ined system structure  )  . 
4. A formal approach
It is this throughout relational structure of meaning that obviously allowed the concept of fuzzy sets and relations to be employed to incorporate vagueness into formal theories of se -mantics  . 
The most recent , and at that most comprehensive approach ( at least I know of ) to tackle the problem of na-tural language meaning  , is that of L . A . 
Zadeh/24/ . Under the acronym PRUF for ' Possibilistic , Relational , Universal , Fuzzy'he has devised a meaning repre-sentation language for natural languages which is possibi listic instead of truth-functional  , and whose dictionary provides linguistic a lly labelled fuzzy subsets of the universe  , instead of sets of semantic markers under word -headings  . 
The basic idea , upon which this approach hinges , is that a referential meaning may be expli cated as a fuzzy correspondence between language terms and a universe of discourse  . This correspondence , L , is formally defined to be a fuzzy binary re lation from a set of language terms  , T , to a universe of dis-course , U . As a fuzzy relation , L is characterized by a membership-function ~ L:TxU-~~  , I \]; x ~ T , z ~ U ;
O : ~ L(X , Z ) ~ I ( I ) which associates with each ordered pair ( x , z ) its grade of membership ~ L(X , Z ) , being a numeric value between uano I , in L , so that
L , : (( x,z ), CL(x,z )) < 2)
The fuzzy relation L now induces a bilateral correspondence according to which a  ) the referencial megning of an element x ' i ~T may be explicated as the fuzzy subset M  ( x ' ) in U , assigned to it by the membership function ~ L conditioned on x '  , M(x ') := , ~L(Z , X ') := <(( x ' , z1) , ~n(x , zl )) ,   . . . . (( X' , Zn ) , ~ L(X' , Zn )   )  >  ( 3 ) b ) the linguistic description of an element z ' in U may be given as a fuzzy subset D  ( z ' ) in T assigned to it by the membership function ~L conditioned on z ' 
D(z'):=~(x,z')::<((Xl,Z'),~L(X l,Z'),? . . , (( Xn , Z ') , ~ L(Xn , Z ' )   ) >  ( 4 ) The definitions given in fuzzy sets theory for equality  , containment , complement , intersection , and union allow for an application both , to referential meanings M ( x ) as subsets of elements in U and to linguistic descriptions D  ( z ) as subsets of units in T . This corresponds to the distinction between scenic  , or conceptual relations on the one hand , and frame , or semantic relations on the other-the latter of which only will be introduced here  . 
Thus , synonymy of two terms x , x ' ~ T may be given as the equality of the two fuzzy subsets M  ( x ) and M ( x ' ) repre-
X : X ' iff ~ L(Z , X ) = ~ L(Z , X ' ) for all z ( 5 ) Partial synonymy may be defined by a similar ity formula introducing some threshold-value sx~x'iff l~L  ( Z , X ) - ~ L(Z , X ' ) & s for all z ( 6 ) Hyponymy of a term x relative to x ' may be explicated as containment of the meaning representing fuzzy sets concerned x~x'iff ~ L  ( z , x)~(z , x ' ) for all z ( 7 ) In so far as the operations of complement , intersection and union are concerned which cor respond to negation  , conjunction and adjunction respective-ly , there has been some critical dis-cussion lately  , particularly on the grounds of experiment a l results  . These suggest that different definitions of operations should be maintained according to and comparable with the scene-frame-distinct ionaluded to above  . For the generation of new meanings which denote possible but not yet labeled elements  ( or sets of elements ) in U , it can well be argued that the following def initions should operate on both  , referential meanings M ( x ) and linguis-tic descriptions D ( z ) the former of which only are given here . 
Negation ( complement ) : ~ x := M ( x ) = I-~L ( Z , X ) for all z (8)
Conjunctio ~( intersection ): x ~ , x ' := M(x ~ x ') = minimL(z , x ) , ~( z , x ')\] for all z (9)
Adjunction ( union ) : xvx':=M ( xox ' ) = max\[~L ( Z , X \] , ~L(Z , X ' ) \] for all z ( 10 ) Although formally satisfactory-as outl ined and illustrated by PRUF-the approach's basic assumption concerning the referential nature of natural meaning proves to be crucial for its empir-ical applicability : in order to deter-mine the membership-grades of a fuzzy set  , or fuzzy relation respectively , one has to have access to relevant empirical data defined to constitute the sets  , and some operational means to calculate the numerical values from these data  . 
As the domain of the fuzzy relation ~ contain not only the set of terms iL of a language  , T , but also the set of objects and/or processes these terms are believed to denote in the universe  , U , both these sets should be accessible in order to let an empirical procedure be devised that could be assigned to  ; ~ T . " All that Zadeh /24/ is offering in That respect , stays empirically rather vague . 
He assumes that " each of the symbols or names in T may be define dostensively or by exemplif ication  . That is by pointing or otherwise focussing on a real or abstract object in U and indi-cating the degree-on the scale from  0 to I-to which it is compatible with the symbol in question "  . 
This cannot be considered a solution which may be called both adequate and operational in the above sense  . Taken to be executable , Zadeh's suggestion necessarily involves prob and s ' question-ing about what they think or believe a term denotes  . Thus , the procedure would again have to rely on the individual in-trospection of a multitude of competent speakers  , instead of making these speakers employ the term 's denotational and/or connotational function in the course of communicative verbal interaction  . However , experimental psychol-ogy has taught us to expect considerate differences between what people think they would do under certain presupposed conditions  , and what in fact they will do when the second i tions are real  . And there is every reason to assume that this di fference is found in cases of language per formance  , too . 
So , it would appear more appropriate to make natura l language use the basis for identifying those language regular-ities  , which under certain communication frame cond it ions real speakers/hearers follow and/or establish in dis-course  . These will consequently allow natural language meaning  ( whatever that may be ) not only to be intended and understood , but also to be analysed and represented . As this apparently is the only certainty about meaning anyway  , namely that it can only be constituted by means of natural language texts  , these should also be able to provide the necessary data with the advantage of being empi rically accessible  . As-sembled in a pragmatically homogeneous corpus  , the usage regularities which the lexical items produce  , may thus beical values obtained to define fuzzy vocabulary mappings  /16/  . 
5. An empirical reconstruct ! on
Following this line of argument is to ask for a connotational supplement to the denotational approach Zadeh forwarded so far  . This goes along with a necessary re-in terp retation of what the sets T and U  ( I ) in the referential meaning relation possib lyst and for  . 
From a structural point-of-view , T is not just a set of terms of a language any more  , but a system of lexical units the usage regular i ties of which induce a relational st ructure of its own  . So , this structure does not just allow for a set of objects and/or processes in U to be denoted  , but it constitutes them as a system of concept -points  , which is dependent on , but not identical with the one induced by the usage regular-ities of terms as employed and identi-fied in natural language discourse  /17/  . 
Thus , being a non-symmetric , fuzzy , binary relation , ~can empirically be reconstructed only on the basis of natural language discourse data  . So far , statistical procedures have been used for the reconstruction by a con-secutive mapping in three stages from T to U  , providing the membership-grades f?ro~nL the " first stage co-occurrences of terms are not just counted but the in-tensities of co- occurring terms in the texts of the database are calculated  . 
This is done by a modified correlation-coe fficient ~ that measures mutual  ( po-sitive ) affinity or ( negative ) repug-nancy of pairs of terms x , x ' ~ T by real numbers from the interval \[- I , + I\] . 
can therefore be considered a fuzzy re-lation in the Cartesian-product of the set of terms T used in the texts analysed : TxT  , ~ ,   , I :\[- I , + I \]; :: xi , i:I .   .   .   .   . nT ( 1 1 By conditioning this fuzzy relation on the x  ~ T  , we get a non-fuzzy mapping ~ Ixi : T--->I n  , C := In (12)
This mapping assigns to each x ~ T one and only one so-called corpus-pointy defined by then- tupel of membership-grades ~  ( xi , x ) in the corpus space C~(xi , x ) := y~C ( 13 ) Each corpus-point y ' ~ C may thus be considered a formal notation of the usage regular it i es  , measured by grades of intensity , anyone term x ' shows against all the other terms x  . ~/ T . 
On the seconds . tage the diferences of usage are calculated . This is done by a distance measure ~ , which yields real , non-negative , numeri?al values from an i interval standard ized to  \[0  , 1\] to denote the d is tances between any two corpus - points y  , y ' ~ C . ~I can also be considered a fuzzy , binary relation in the set of all corpus-po intsy  . defined to constitute the corpusspace lC~I : CxC--~I  ; I :=\[ O , 1\];
C::\[yi , i = I . . . . n(I4)
By conditioning this fuzzy relation ~.
on the Yi ( or-following (13) - the ~ x . respectively ) we get a non-fuzzyi mapping $ 11xi:C--tin ; U := In (15)
This mapping assigns to each y ~ C ( or x6T respectively ) one and only one so-called meaning-or concept -point z de-fined by then-tupe ! of dis tance-values in the semantic space U  , ~ I ( Yi ' x ) : ~ I ( Yi'y ) :: ze U ( 16 ) Each concept-point z ' ~ U may thus be cons idered a formal notation of all the dif ferences of all usage regularities  , as a function of which the meaning of a term x ' ~T can be characterized  . 
Therefore it can be identified-according to ( 13 ) -with ( 4 )   , i . e . the liniguistic d@iScrliptlion , D(z ') , of a concept-point z ' which is a fuzzy subset in T  ~1  ( xi , z ') := D(z ') CT (17)
On the third stage of the conse-cutive mapping , there will topological environments of concept-points be cal-culated-in analogy to  ( 14 ) -by a distance measure ~9 which specifies the distances between ~ ny two z  , z ' ~ U . Thus again , ~92 may also be interpreted as a fuzzy , binary relation in the set of all concept- points z defined to con-stitute the semant icl space U  ~2 : UxU--~I ; I :=\[ O , 1\];
U :: Zi;i : I . . . . , n (18)
The conditioning of ~^ on the z results in a non-fuzzy ~ apping i which assigns to each z ~ U  ( and - following ( 16 ) -x ~ T respectively ) one and only on en-tupel of distances that- scaled according to decreasing values-will constitute the environment E  ( z )  $2 ( zi , x ) = $2(zi , z ) := E ( z )   ( 20 ) Any such environment E ( z ' ) can be considered a formal means to describe the position of a concept point z ' by its adjacent neighbours in the semantic space which is constituted by functions of differences of language usage regularities  . E ( z ' ) can therefore be identified-following ( 16 ) and ( 20 ) -with ( 3 ) the conceptual meaning , M(x ') , of a term x ' which is a fuzzy subset in U~2(zi , x ') := M(x ') cU(21)
We are now in the position to assign to the fuzzy relation : Tx  ( 22 ) and the two-sided correspondence 3 ) and ( 4 ) induced by it , the following operations . 
The two distance measures ~(14) and ~9(18) , operating an numerical " data obtained from the correlational analysis  ( 11 ) of lexical items employed in a corpus of natural language texts  , will determine the membership-grades to be associated with  ( 22 )  , namely for the correspondence ( 4 ) induced by tL according to ( 15 ) inserting al ) Xi := , ( xi , zi ) = T ( 23 ) and for its inversion the correspondence ( 3 ) according to ( 19 ) inserting % Izi ( 24 ) 
This concludes the empirical reconstruction , leaving open only the coeffi-cients alluded to above  . 
Given the lemmatized vocabulary V as a proper subset of T of lexical units 
V := xi ~; i = 1, . . . ,n employed in a corpus K of natural language texts as specified above 
K := ~ t ; t = 1, . . . ,m where m ~- st := S S = st ; It t = 1 ( 25 ) is the sumS of all text-lengthsst measured by the number of lexical units  ( tokens ) in the corpus , and m
H = ~ ht!It ~ ht ~ Ht=1 ( 26 ) is the total frequency H of a lexical unit x ( type ) computed over all texts in the corpus , then the modified corre-lation-coefficient ~ x to be inserted into  ( 11 ) reads m ~_ ( ht-ht* ) ' ( h\[-ht ~ ) 
O4(X , X ' ) = t=1htr ht ~ )  2  ( h\[_h\[~ ) 2/2\t = lt = l-I ~ . ~( X , X ') ~+ I(27) with ~= H , ~ = HIht\[st and ht\[st (28)
The distances have been calculated according to the following measures which for  c91   ( 14 ) reads n2 . .
I ....
i = i,~(x,xi)2 + ~ t(x ', Xi)2;
O-Z~I(Y'Y')L2(29) and ~2(18) reads~2(z , z ) ( in = ~1(~1(Y , Yi ) 21(Y , Yi )) 2) I/2I = -- I ;   ( 3o )   -81 As these distance measures satisfying the conditions are to be considered the metric of the corpus space C and the se-mantic space U respectively  , it should be noted here that so farthe assumpt ion of it being Euclidean  ( 30 ) is nothing but a fist ( although operational ) guess . Experiments with different distance measures one of which is  ( 29 ) are currently undertaken . Eventually , these might prove to be more adequate one day in mod-elling word-semantic systems'st ructures  .

West-German language comparison.
So far , two samples from corpora consisting of texts from the East-Ger-man newspaper ' Neues Deutschland ' and the West-German newspaper ' Die Welt'have been analysed according to the procedures outlined  . Although the samples analysed are rather small -approximately  3000 running words ( tokens ) of roughly 300 lemmatized words ( types ) -the results look quite promising to the nat ivespeaker of German  . In mapping the connotational difference which some morphologically identical German lexical entries have developed almostsi-mul taneously after twenty years of usage in a der ided country's rather strictly separated population  , the pilot-study's results seem to indicate that-linguistically-an add it ional analysis of comparable text-corpora of earlier and/or later years could provide the d iachronic complement to the so far  synchr0nic investigation into the lexical structures concerned  , allowing for the empirical reconstruction not only of their instantaneous word-meanings  , but of their time-dependent procdural changes that Nowakowska  /13/ aims at . Being induced by varying language usages , these can operationally be analysed as regularities followed and/or established by language users to differing degrees  , which hence may formally be represented as functions that constitute dynamic systems to model semiotic structures  . 
In the above Tables I and 2 the linguistic depcription D ( z ) of a concept point z is given as well as the conceptual megning M  ( x ) of a vocabulary term x from both of the newspaper corp-or a further details of which may be found in  /18/  . 

This paper an earlier version of which was presented under the title " Fuzzy Represent at ion Systems in Linguistic Semantics " at the  8th European Meeting on Cybernetics and Systems Research  ( EMCSR/8 ) in Vienna , Austria , in April 1980 , is in some parts identical with /19/ . It takes up the model con-struction resulting from a project in Empirical Semantics supported by the Northrhine-Westphalia Min is try of Science and Research  , applied to the language data provided by the German Research Foundation's project on East -West-German language comparison  . I would like to thank Dr . H . M . Dannhauer for providing his programming a bili ties to process these language data so effi- ciently at the Technical University of 
Aachen Computing Centre.
