Abstract
We introduce a generalization of o a tegoria l grammar extending its descrip-tive power ~ and a simple model of oatego-rialgram  . at parser . ~ oth tools 08/% be adjusted to particular strata of languages via restricting gralm natieal or computatio-nal complexity '  . 
I .   . Two questions about oateg prial6\]ra3,1arsIn . spite of the fascinating folnnal simplic ity  8/Id lucidity of o a tegorial grammar as deve loped by Bar-Hillel \[ I\]q ~ Eunbek  \[7\] and followers , it has never-theless never been brou ~' ht into wide scale use  . Why ' is this so ? We may ' easily ' recognize two drawbacks  .

This is the first quest i on we try ' to ~ lswer  .

The schematic description of eate-gorial analysis of a given sentence aI  .  ? . 
?  .   . a is sketched in Fig ' . I . n assign a category ' ciial i2 "'" into each sentence member a . eI02 . . . encancel the string of categories to the target category ' t t Fig  .   1 This abstract scheme cannot serve as a descr iption of a realistic parsing procedure  . The suitable assig~ement appe-aring here as the first phase is in fact the goal of the parsing  . The " brute force " approach following the above scheme  , which cheeks all possible assignements and tries to e Eu ~ eel them is note omputationally ' tractable  , since for most granmlar S the nul , ber of all possible assignements grows exponentially with the length of the ana lysed sentence  . 
The moral of this obsel ~ vation is that the ass i ~ nementoaru ~ ot be separated from the cancel lation  . Similarly as parsers based on phrase-str ~oture grammars have to make at each point of t i mean intelli-gent choice of rule to app ly next ~ the eategorial parser must m ~ kean in telligen ~ choice out of a list of alte rnative oate-n'cries  . This necessity to lookahead at cancell at i on when making the assignement leads to the conclusion  \[6 \] that assi~nement and cancellation must in any ' actual parser be interwoven  . Therefore our second keyqlles ~ i on reads : Can this interweaving " be grasped by ' a simple formal model or does it unavoi-dingly lead to ~ mess of complicated adhoe and heurist icteel miques ?

We introduce in nontechnical langn/-a ~' ethe essence of the proposed generaliza-tion of eategorial gran  . nars ~ d their parsers . Tile exact mathematical formulations can be found in  \[3\]  .

LA consists of a nondeterministie finite state o on t ~ ol unit attached to a finite -tape  . At the begil minc of the Ooln putation " the tape contains the analysed string ? The automaton can read  8/id rewrites o ~ , ~ aned symbols and move the soauning head one tape cell to the left or right analogously as Tur : Lng machine ? In addition to it  , it can delete " the scamped oell ~ i . e . out it outarid paste the remaining'tape par ts to ~' ether  . 
In the remainder of the paragraph we list resu lts indicating  , as we believe ~ that the concepts of G-CO and LA give satisfae to : cy ' auswers be the above questions  . 
a/~ndmufb3xaleoxl resppndenc ~ . Both GCGs and LA represent exactly all context -sensitive:  kan6~u~6"eSo Similarly ' like in % he ease of Cl , '-6 . r ~ umnars and push do ~ nauto-mata or oon ' bext- sensitive ~' ralmnars and linearly ' bounded automata  \[5 \] there exist transformations of GCGs to LA and " vice versa : aual ~' or  . ithm Aj , which for each GCGGy'ields a LAAI ( G ) represent in C thesa . ,e 1 ; luggage ~ nd conversely ' an algorithm A 2 which for each LAM y'i elds an equivalent GCG  A2  ( M ) The next step in our arg~nent is to point out are mark ab'ke feature of the interplay ' between GCGs and LA  , b/Stratif ' a eation . Tihe correspondence between GCGs and LA ca ~ be observed not only ' in the whole class of context-sensi-tive languag'es  , but also on the level of CF- lan6~ages and in each of infinitely many'strata between CF a CS-lang ~ ages  . The stratification can be defined via two complexity measures  . 
O r~u3nn~tic~l -pomplexity ": given a GCGC and a string w , the ~ rmm natieal comple-xity ' of w wrt . G , denoted G ( w ) ~ is defined as ' the lengt\[h of the longest category ' used in the aualy's is wrt  .  ~  . 
(For alabi~uous gralmllars ~ " the oonlplexity ' : ks defined for each \[ parse of the string  )   . 
. C0mpn~at ional complexity \[: given a LAM and 6%   strin0  ; W , the computational complexity ' of W wrt . ~ denoted M(w ) , is defined as the maximal number of visit spaid to a sing'le square during the accept ing computation  ( ambiguity being treated as before )   . 
In " tilelight of these complexity measures we can reconsider the relation between GCGs and LA determilled by ' the above mentioned al F  ; or it l ~ usAI and A2 Fors . ny'GCGG and\[any'sentence w , each ~ r 6Ull mabie ~ l description of w wrt .

Now , any function f mappin ~ natural numbers on naturalnt unbers de be T -  . lines a stratum S(f ) of lan ~ . t la6"es : a langmlag ~ eL belongs to the stratum 8 ~ if and only ' if i to ~ n be represented by ' a GCGG  ( Or equivalently a LAM ) such that from eaeb sentence w from L of l engthn  , the complexity ' G ( w )   ( or M ( w )   ) does not exceed the : numbel ~ f ( n )   . OuT previous considerations show that the a lgorithms  /11  '  &2 respect the stratifi ~ oatio_n .
