ProOect DOC : Its Methodological Basis 1
William SY . Wang

Dictionary on Computer ~ hereafter DOC , is part of an
overall effort to harness an online computer for phonological research  . For certain problems the linguist finds it necessary to organize large amounts of data  , or to per-form rather involved logical tasks -- such as checking out a body of rules with intricate ordering relations  . In these situations a computer can be invaluable in that it forces the linguist to think through his problems with great precision and in that it can do certain jobs with a speed and accuracy not otherwise possible  . 
The overtaim of DOC is to reconstruct the phonological histories of the major Chinese dialects  . At a deeper level our interest is to find out more about how phonological structures change in general and the relation between these changes and the synchronic systems they lead to  . To achieve these objectives we must attempt to account for oceans of data  ( the regular and irregular developments of thousands of morphemes in dozens of dialects  )  . The hypotheses we posit , i . e . , the reconstructed forms and the associated rules ~ are likewise numerous and complex  . The project is further complicated by the tens -2-of thousands of logographs which must be contended with  , especially when we involve the rime dictionaries and the rime tables  . These considerations lead naturally to the 2 use of a computer in our work . 
To construct significant ~4vpotheses and to generalize them beyond the confines of our data pool  , to grasp the theoretical import of each discovery  , clearly these are creative tasks that cannot be mechanized  . Nonethelessa ~ ! ell-hewn tool , such as we hope to develop D0C into , can contribute substantially to facilitate these creative tasks  . 
Of the many language families in the world , Chinese offers an ideal laboratory within which to study phonolo-gical change for many reasons  . Chief among these are two: ( 1 ) its unrivaled wealth of materials , and ( 2 ) its dis-tinctive phonology and orthography . 
(1) The earlies textant materials date back to ca.
1500 B . C . in the form of oracle inscriptions . We have a virtual time depth of some three and one-half millenia of literature  . This literature includes not only such works as rime tables and rime dictionaries  , but also extensive contributions from a tradition of philological scholarship that arose in the early Son~and reached considerable sophist ication in the Qing period  . Indeed the view has been expressed that in China the mebhods of scientific reasoning were primari ly developed in the hands  -3-of the Qing philologists ( as opposed to Europe where they originate in the physical sciences  )  . Few language groups compare with Chinese with respect to this immense treasure of literature to work with  . 
(2 ) By far the greatest bulk of the present knowledge of phonological change comes from investigations of Indo-European languages  . It is not unlikely , then , that the present theories and methods are skewed in the direction of characteristics found in these languages  . Studying a language family with a very different structure will help us balance this skewed perspective  . Indeed Meillet must have had something like this in mind back in  1913 when , in discussing the comparative method , he wrote : " Lesrap prochements regoivent des confirmations utiles quand on peut constater que desconcordances grammatical ess'ajoutent~la concordance duson and dusens  . . . . Les langues qui , commeles langues in do-europ ~ enes . . . on tdes particular it~s grammaticales attach ~ es ~ certaih mots sep reter it donc mieux ~ lad ~monstration del'~tymologie queles langueo ~ to usles mots seconforment auxm~mer ~ gles grammaticales  . Ladifficult ~ qu ' on 6prouve ~ poser lagrammaire compar~e decertaines langues  , not amment en Extreme-Orient , vienten partied elg . " < p .  32) . 
A language of the Chinese type is distinct in that  ( a ) it has no inflectional paradigms and no morphophonemic alternations to speak of  , ( b ) it has a very simple syllabic-4-structure , ( c ) it hast ones , and ( d ) its orthography is logographic . These characteristics all have implications for research on phonological change  . 
( a ) Current views of diachronic phonology invariably emphasize the importance of paradigmatic analogy as one of the two major fonces of phonological change  ( the other major force being phonetic )  . The formalization of analogy may be in terms of proportionality in a structuralist framework  , or in terms of rule simplification within the context of generative phonology  . It would be of considerable theoretical interest to examine these views with respect to Chinese  , which has virtually no paradigms . In particular we would want to investigate what are the mechanisms whereby a changed iff uses lexically  3 in Chinese , where word classes are not related by morphophonemic alternations  . An understanding of these mechanisms is crucial toward answering the question of whether phonolo -gical change is or is not phonetically actuated  . 
( b ) The simple syllabic structure of the morphemes and the even accentual structure of the sentences are also of special interest  . ~ ereas many recurrent types of change outside of Chinese involve the reduction of consonant clusters in to geminates  , or the breaking up of clusters by vowel epen thesis  , or the reduction of syllabic elements due to stress shifts  , these changes hardly occur at all in Chinese . The pervasive themes found in phonological -5-structures like Chinese are palatalizatibn , dento-labiali-zatien , reduction of post-vocalic obstruents , and various complex interplays between the segmental syllable and tones  . 
Research on phonological change now suffers from a severe lack of a systematic catalog of carefully documented changes  . Given that X has the reflex Y , we need to know if this change was induced within the system or if it was actuated by another linguistic system  ; did X go directly into Y or were there intermediate phonemic stages  ; if each direct change was abruptor gradual , phonetically and lexically . Only when a sufficient fund of such information is available can one successfully meet the challenge of phonetic and other types of explanations  , and only then can phonology make the exciting transition from a descriptive effort into an explanatory science  . DOC is designed to ~ facilitate the gathering of this fund of information  . 
The tones of Chinese have intrigued students of language for many years  . They are of interest to phonological theory because they form a relatively  self-c6ntained subsystem in the sound structure that can serve as a relatively independent testing ground for the theory  . The Chinese have had a categorical ( though not physical ) understanding of the tones of their language for well over  1500 years . 
During this period although the morpheme membership of the tonal categories has been relatively stable  , the physical manifestations of the tones have undergone considerable  -6-changes ? Some of these changes , it appears , are intricately connected to segmental features . The investigation of these changes can contribute much toward our understanding of the inter-relat ionships between phonation and articulation  . 
Lastly , the logographic syztem of writing has certain unique implications  . Since the logographs are much more distantly related to the sounds of the language than are the alphabets of the European languages  , one can assume that they have exerted very litt leinfluence on the developments of the various sound systems  . In other words , we have fewer cases of historical confusion due to spelling pronunciation to contend with  . By the same token the logo-graphs themselves have an amazing longevity  , so that we can make many inferences about their phonetics for as far back as three thousand years ago  . 
In sum , then , DOC is being developed as a powerful too 1 that will give phonological research aspeed and pre-cision not otherwise attainable  . Its creative use can lead us to a deeper understanding of phonological structure and change on a quantitative basis  , at present this tool is being developed within the context of Chinese  , for the reasons outlined in the foregoing paragraphs ~ We expect that the methods we will have worked out will be largely applicable to the study of the phonology of any language group  . Indeed , it is to be hoped that a field like -7-Indo-European may one day be subjected to the rigors of this tool  , and its results validated on a quantitative and objective basis  . 

At present the primary source of data is the Hanyu Fangyin Zihui  . a The 17 dialects reported in the Zihui are now available on Linctape  . Outside of the Zihui , we have the complete Kan-on , Go-on , Sino-Korean and portions of the Zhongyuan Yinyun . 
For a variety of reasons , such as ease of tape-punching , ease of proofreading and error-correction , and ease of writing of utility programs , the data are stored in several formats . These formats are related to each other by a set of supporting programs  , as shown in Figure 1 . 
The rectangles indicate data formats and the circles indicate supporting programs  . 
The first stage in the data collection is the punching of paper tape on the teletype  . A standard entry requires 24 punches : -8-i . space 25 . telegraphic code(G ) 7 . dialect identification ( D ) 89 . tone(T ) 1013 . initial ( I ) 1415 . medial ( M ) 1620 . nucleus ( N ) 21 . ending ( E ) 22 . literary ( L ) 23 . carriage return (~) 24 . line feedi ~ unches 23 and 24 are discarded by the supporting program RDPT ( Readl ~ a per Tape )  . After using RDPT the resulting Dialect tape should have the structure illustrated in 
Figure 2.
For proofreading and error correcting , the Dialect tapes may be converted into File tapes in the format of LAI ~'  6 ~ as shown in Figure 3  . In this format each entry has 20 characters ( or half-words ) which is the maximum number that can be displayed per line on the scope leach entry is further followed by a CASE  ( Linccode 23 ) that is disregarded by FILE DOC and a ~ ( Linccode 12 ) that shifts the display to the next line . So each entry ~ on the Linctape is still 22 characters or iI words long , even though only 20 characters are displayed . The spaces ( Liuccode 14 ) are converted in to periods ( Linccode 20 ) for ease of reading . 

LA~~6D is modified from LAP6 in two ways . The left margin is moved 4 positions to the left so that each entry will exactly fit one line  . Note space is allotted for files on both the system stape and the filetape  . 
According to my present understanding , each dialect tape is just about the size that a single file can accommodate  . 
The uses of L~~6D files are obvious . We can use the full set of metacommands for such files as well as the editing conveniences  . 
The AC tape contains the ~ i~-Y ~ n information for the logographs as these are recorded in the Zihui  , as shown in Figure 4 . The use of this tape makes it possible to add this information to any dialect tape by matching the telegraphic codes via the ACCODJ ~ program  . The resultant AC-Dialect tape has the structure also shown in Figure  4  . 
Notice that positions 17 through 32 correspond to 7 through 22 in entry structure of Dialect tape illustrated in Figure  2  . As shown in ( D ) in Figure 4 , the number of @ ia-lect forms for each entry can be easily increased  . 
Finally , it will be useful for certain problems to have the result in the form of ase $ of logographs  . At present our computer can only give us the telegraphic code of the characters  . With LOGOTAB we hope to be able to display the logographs on the scope and/or print them cut by means of a special purpose computer  . The 16 x 16 matrix representations of several thousand logographs have-lO-already been designed by Susumu Kuno's group at the Harvard Computation Laboratory  , cf . Hayashi , et al , 1968 . LOGOTAB will be essentially a table lookup program that will translate telegraphic codes into those matrix representations  . We are also giving thought to a similar logograph input device as that used by the 
Harvard group.

Although the ideas for DOC were first conceived in  1966  , it is only in latespring 1969 that the project began to be operational . Several linguistic programs have been written for it  , especially with respect to the seven Mandarin dialects  . In Figure 5 we see a correlation program that quantifies the development of the Ancient Ghinese tones into each of the Maudarin dialects  . The points of greatest interest are of course with the cells which show the small number of exceptional developments  . Are the ~ due to borrowing from other dialects , residue from changes that have not yet completed their course  , or a ~ e ~ heydue to the inception of new changes yet to be system a timed ~ As the data pool becomes richer and richer with the addition of each new dialector rime dictionary  , it became-ll-increasingly obvious that our little laboratory Linc would not be able to cope with all the problems efficiently  . Since the beginning of the summer , Tom McGuire of the Phonology Laboratory has helped uses tablish a remote terminal that connects to the CDC  6400 in the University Computer Center . Some of Our materials have already been converted into magnetic tape that is compatible with that ~ computer  . An example of the new format of DOC is shown in Figure  6  .

3o The hypothesis of lexical diffusion , i . e . , phonological change operates gradually across the lexicon is admittedly controversial  . The hypothesis would not be acceptable to theorists in the Neogrammarian tradition  , e . g . , L . Bloomfield . However , as I argue in Wang (1969) , there are good reasons for thinking that this is indeed how changes are implemented within narrow time spans  , i . e . , morpheme by morpheme rather than phoneme by phoneme  . The proof of the hypothesis requires largescale studies of the sort exemplified by DOC  . 
4 . The Zihui has many drawbacks , as pointed out in Lyovin's review (1969) . However , it is obviously the best set of core materials co start the project on  .
