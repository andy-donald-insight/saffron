Abstract
\[ n the field of statistical analysis of
natural language data , the measure of
word/class association has proved to be quite useful for discovering a meaning-tiff sense cluster in an arbitrary level of the thesaurus  . In this paper , we apply its idea to the sense classification of Japanese verbal polysemy in case frame acquisition from JapaneseEnglish parallel corpora  . Measures of bilingual class ~ class association and bilingual class/frame association are introduced and used for discovering sense clusters in the sense distribution of English predicates and Japanese case element nouns  . 
In a small experiment , 93 . 3% of the discovered clusters are correct in that none of them contains examples of more than one hand-classified senses  . 
1 Introduction
In corpus-based NLP , acquisition of lexical knowledge has become one of the major research topics  . 
Among several research topics in this field , acquisition from parallel corpora is quite attractive  ( e . g . 
Dagan et al (1991)) . The reason is that parallel sentences are useful for resolving both syntactic and lexical ambiguities in the monolingual sentences  . Especially if the two languages have different syntactic structures and word meanings  ( such as English and Japanese )  , this approach has proved to be most effective in disambiguation  ( Matsumoto et al , 1993; Utsuro et al ,  1993) . 
Utsuro et al ( 1993 ) proposed a method for acquiring surface case frames of Japanese verbs from JapaneseEnglish parallel corpora  . In this method , translated English verbs and case labels are used to classify senses of Japanese polysemous verbs  . Clues to sense classification are found using English verbs and case labels  , as well as the sense distribution of the Japanese case element * The author would like to thank Prof  . Yuji MAT-SUMOTO for his valuable comments on this research  .

nouns . Then , a human instructor judges whether the clues are correct  . One of the major disadvantages of the method is that the use of English information and sense distribution of Japanese case element nouns is restricted  . Only surface forms of English verbs and case labels are used and sense distribution of English verbs is not used  . Also , the threshold of deciding a distinction in the sense distribution of Japanese case element nouns is predetermined on a fixed level in a Japanese thesaurus  . 
As a result , the human instructor is frequently asked to judge the correctness of the clue  . 
In the field of statistical analysis of natural language data  , it is common to use measures of lexical association  , such as the information-theoretic measure of mutual information  , to extract useful relationships between words ( e . g . 
Church and Hanks (1990)) . Lexical association has its limits , however , since often either the data is insufficient o provide reliable word/word correspondences  , or the task requires more abstraction than word /word correspondences permit  . Thus , Resnik ( 1992 ) proposed a useful mea ~ sure of word/class association by generalizing information-theoretic measure of word/word association  . The proposed measure addresses the limitations of lexical association by facilitating sta ~ tistical discovery of facts involving word classes rather than individual words  . 
We find the measure of word/class association of Resnik  ( 1992 ) is quite attractive , since it is possible to discover a meaningful sense club-ter in an arbitrary level of the thesaurus  . We thus expect that the restrictions of the previous method of Utsuro et al  ( 1993 ) can be Over-come by employing the idea of the measure of word/class association  . In this paper , we describe how this idea can be applied to the sense classification of Japanese verbal polysemy in case frame acquisition from JapaneseEnglish parallel corpora  . First , sense distribution of English predicates and Japanese case element nouns is represented using monolingual English and Japanese thesaurus  , respectively ( sections 2 and 3) . Then , the measure of the association of classes of English predicates and Japanese case element nouns  , i . e . , a measure of bilingual class~class association , is introduced , and extended into a measure of bilingual class /frame association  ( section 4 )  . 

Using these measures , sense clusters are discovered in the . sense distribution of English predicates and , lapanese ease element nouns . Finally , examples of a Japanese polysemous verb collected from  , /apanese-l'\]nglish parallel corpora are cli -vided into disjoint clusters according to those discovered sense clusters  ( section 5 )  . The results of a small experiment are presented and the proposed measure is evaluated  ( section 6 )  . 
2 Bilingual Surface Case Structure
In the framework of verbal case frame acquisition fi'om parallel corpora  , bilingually matched surface case structures ( Matsumoto et a\[ .   ,  1993 ) are collected and surface case frames of Japanese verbs are acquired ti ' om the collection  , in this paper , each bilingually matched surface case structure is  ( : ailed a bilingual surface case structure , and represented as a feature structure : p'red : vase mu : SEMi  , pl:sere:SEMal :

When a . Japanese noun njit ins several senses , it may appear in severale af classes in the , lapanese thesaurus . Thus , St '; Mai is represented as a . set of " those classes , and is referred to as a se-mantic label . St '; ML , is a semantic label of the corresponding English predicate  , i . e . , a set of classes in the English thesaurus : , gl '; Mu = cE1 .   .   .   .   .

By structurally matching the JapaneseEnglish parallel sentences in Example  1  , the following bilingual surface case structure is obtained :

In Roget's Thesaurus , the verb " han . q " has four senses . In BGH , the nouns " watash , i " and " u wag i " have only one sense , respectively , and " kagi " has four senses .

A thesaurus is regarded as a tree in which each node represents a class  . We introduce ~ as the superordinate-subordinate relation of closes  . In general , c1_~ e2 means that clissubordinate to c2 . We define -/ so that a semantic label SEM = cl ,   .   .   . , cn  is subordinate to each class ci:

When searching for classes which give maximum associations cm'e  ( section 5 )  , this detinition makes it possible to calculate association score for all the senses in a semantic label and to find senses which give a maximum association score ~  .

Roget's lhesal rush as a seven-layered abstraction hierarchy and over  100  , 000 words are allocated at the leaves a . In Roget's Thesaurus , sense classification is preferred to part of speech distinction  . Thus , a noun and a verb which have similar senses are assigned similar classes in the thesanrus  . 
4 Class-based Association Score 4 . 1 Word/Class Association Score The measure of word /class association of Resnik  ( 1992 ) can be illustrated by the problem of finding tile prototypical object classes for verbs  . 
Let ) 2 and A /" be the sets of all verbs and norms , respectively . ( liven a verb v(E ) 2) and a norm class c(CN') , the joint probability of v and c is estimated as ~'2 count ( v , r ~) " n ~ c Pr(v , e )
EEv ' CV nJ c . Af
The association score A(v , c ) of a verb v and a noun class c is defined as Pr ( v , c)-Pr(c\[v)l(v ; e)A(v , c ) -- Pr ( cIv ) log Pr ( v ) Pr ( c ) The association score takes the mutual information between the verb and a noun class  , and scales 1This process corresponds to sense disamblguation by maximizing the association score  . 
2Five classes are allocated at the next level from the root node : abstract-relations  , agents-@human-activities , human-activities , products , and natural-objects-and-natural-phenomena . 
SAt the next level from the root node , it has six classes : abstract-relations , space , matter , intellect , vo-lition , and affections . 
9 69 it according to the likelihood that a member of the class will actually appear as the object of the verb  . 
The first term of the conditional probability measures the generality of the association  , while the second term of the mutual information measures the cooccurrence of the association  . 
4.2 Bilingual Class/Class Association

We now apply the word/class association score to the task of measuring the association of classes of English predicates and Japanese case element nouns in the collection of bilingual surface ease structures  . First , we assume that for any polysemous Japanese verb v j  , there exists a case marker p which is most effective for sense classification of v j  . Given the collection of bilingual surface case structures for v j  , we introduce the bilingual class/class association score for measuring the association of a class cE of English predicates and a class c j of Japanese case element nouns for a case marker p  . 
Let Eg(vg , p ) be the set of bilingual surface case structures collected fronlthe JapaneseEnglish parallel corpora  , each element of which has a Japanese verb vj and a Japanese case marker p  . Among the elements of Eg(vj , p ) , let Eg(vj , p , c  ~ ) be the set of those whose semantic label SEME of the English predicate satisfies the class c ~  , i . e . , SEME ~ cE , and Eg(vj , p/cj ) be the set of those whose semantic label SEMj of the Japanese case element noun for the case marker p satisfies the class cj  , i . e . , SEMjcj . Let l '; g(vj , cE , p/cj ) be the intersection of Eg(vj , p , c~i ) and Eg(vj , p/cj ) . Then , conditional probabilities Pr(cEIra , p ) , Pr(cjIva , p ) , and Pr(cE , cjIvj , p ) are defined as the ratios of the numbers of the elements of those sets : \[ Eg  ( vJ , p , cE)\[pr(c-
Pr ( , : , , IvJ , p)-
IE(v , p)I
Pr(cE , cJIvj , p ) =\] Eg(v,p)l
Then , given vj and p , the association scoreA(c ~ ,  . , cjIvj , p ) of cE and cj is defined as
A(cE , cj\[vj , p ) =
Pr(cs , c~Ivj , p)
Pr(e ~, c jIv . l , p ) logPr(cE\[vj , p ) Pr(cjIvj , p ) This definition is slightly different from that of the word/class association score in that it only needs these tEg  ( vj , p ) for a Japanese verb vy and a Japanese case marker p  , but not the whole 3apanese-Engl ish parallel corpora . This is because our task is to discover strong association of an English  ( : lass and a Japanese class in Eg ( vj , p ) , rather than in the whole Japanese-English parallel corpora  . Besides , as the first term for mea-snring the generality of the association  , we use Pr(cE , c j\[v j , p ) instead of Pr(c , , I v j , p , cl ~) or
Pr(c ~\[ vj , p/cj ) below : *
IEg/-,I
Pr(cz\[vj , p , cE ) =
Pr(cE\[vj , p/cj ) = 4 . 3 Bilingual Class/Frame Association

In the previous section , we assume that for any polysemous Japanese verb v j  , there exists a case marker p which is most effective for sense classification of verbal polysemy vj  . However , it can happen that a combination of more than one ease marker characterizes a sense of the verbal poly-senly vj  . Even if there exists exactly one case marker which is most effective for sense classification  , it is necessary to select the most effective case marker automatically by some measure  . For example , using some measure , it is desirable to automatically discover the fact that  , for the task of sense classification of verbal polysenry  , subject nouns are usually n lost effective for intransitive verbs  , while object nouns are usually most effective for transitive verbs  . 
This section generalizes the previous defini-tion of bilingual class/class association score  , and introduces the bilingual class/frame association score  . In the new definition , we consider every possible set of pairs of a Japanese case marker p and a Japanese noun class cj  , instead of predetermining the most effective case marker  . The bilingual class/frame association score measures the association of an English class c ~ and a set of pairs of a Japanese case marker p and a Japanese noun class cs marked by p  . By searching for a large association score , it becomes possible to find any combination of case markers which characterizes a sense of the verbal polysemy vs  . 
4.3.1 Japanese Case-Class Frame
First , we introduce a data structure which represents a set of pairs of Japanese case marker p and a Japanese noun class cj marked by p  , and call it ; Japanese case-class frame . A Japanese case-class frame can be represented as a feature structure : 
Pm:CJm4 pr(cd\[vj , p , cE ) and Pr(eEIvj , p/cd ) are too large in lower parts of the thesaurus , since we focus oi1 examples which have a Japanese verb v . landa Japanese case marker p . When we used the average of Pr(ejIvJ , p , cE ) and Pr(e~\[vj , p/cj ) instead of Pr(eE , cj \] vj , p ) in the experiment d section 6 , most discovered clusters consisted of only one example  . 
970 4.3.2 Subsumption Relation
Next , we introduce subsuraption relation ~/' of ~ a bilingual surface case structure and a Japanese ease-class framefa : e~f  f3 iff . for each case marker p in f's and its noun class c's  , there exists the same case marker pine and its semantic babel SEMj is subordinate to ca  , i . e . SEM'S~caThis definition can be easily extended into a sub-snmption relation of Japanese case -class frames  . 
4.3.3 Bilingual Class/Prame Association

Let Eg ( va ) be the set of bilingual surface cases trnctures collected from the JapaneseEnglish parallel corpora  , each element of which has a Japanese verb va . Among the elements e of E g(va ) , let Eg(va , cE ) be the set of those whose semantic label SEME of the English predicate satisfies the class cE  , i . e . , SEME ~ cE , and Eg(vj , fd ) be the set of those which satisfy the Japanese case-class frame fa  , i . e . , e~ffj . Let Eg(vj , cf , ; , f a ) be the intersection of Eg(va , cE ) and Eg(va , f a ) . Then , conditional probabilities 1' , '( c ~: Ivj ) , Pr(faira ) , and I'r ( cmf jiva ) are defined as the ratios of the numbers of the elements of those sets :\[  ) I ' ( CEIVJ )  -- \ ]~ ( Vj ) lt ' ,  . ( S's Iv ,)- iEv(~'s)I
Pr(c ~ : , f's I~a ) =
Then , given va , the association score A(cE , fal
V'S ) of cg and fj is defined as
A(cF , , f , , Iv , s ) =
PI"(CE , f'SI~'s)
Pr(es , : , f , , Iva ) log Pr ( c~Iv's ) Pr ( f's Iv's ) As well as the case of the bilingual class/class association score  , this definition only needs these tEg ( ' va ) for a Japanese verb va , not the whole
JapaneseEnglish parallel corpora.
5 Sense Classification of Verbal
Polysemy
This section explains how to classify the elements of the set l '  ) g ( va ) of bilingual surface case structures according to the sense of the verbal poly-scaly va  , with the bilingual class/frame association score defined in the previous section  , hit his classification process , pairs of an English class cz , : and a Japanese case-class frame fj which give large association score A  ( cE , faira ) are searched for . It is desirable that these tEg ( vj ) be divided into disjoint subsets by the discovered pairs of cu and fa  . The classification process proceeds according to the following steps :  1  . First , the index i and the set of examples Eg are initialized as i ~-\] and Eg*-Eg  ( va )  . 
2 . For the ith iteration , let cE and fabea pair of an English class and a Japanese case-class frame which satisfy the following constraint for all the pairs of cEj and fjj  ( l < j < i-1 . ): csu is not subordinate nor superordinate to cEj  ( i . e . , cF , ~cEj and cEj ~ cE ) , or fa is not subordinate nor superordinate to faj  ( i . e . , fJ 741 faj and fjjZffa ) . Then , among those pairs of c ~ and fj , search for a pair eel and fJi which gives maximum association score maxA  ( cE , f aIv j ) , a and collect the ele-cE , fjments of Eg which satisfy the restrictions of CEi and fJi into these tEg  ( va , eel , f . 'i) . 
3 . Subtract the set Eg(va , cu  ~ , fJi ) from E gasEg+--Eg-Eg(va , eel , fal ) . If Eg 7~ O , then increment he index i as i + -- i + 1 and go to step 2  . Otherwise , set the number k of the subsets as k +- i and terminate the class/flea-  . 
t/on process.
As the result of this classification process , these tEg ( vj ) is divided into disjoint subsets Eg ( vj , cN l , fdl ) ,   . . . , Eg(v2, cEk , fak) . 6 For example , if a Japanese polysemous verb vg has both intransitive and transitive senses  , pairs with the subject case like ( era , \ [ subj:Cjl\]) ,  . . . , < CEk,\[s~l . bj : oak , \]) will be discovered for intransitive senses , while pairs with the object case like ( cEk , ~ l , \[ obj:Cdk ,   , q\]) ,   .   .   .   , ( cEk , \[ obj:csk\] ) will be discovered for transitive senses . 
Giventile set Eg(va ) , the iterations of the association score calculation is O  ( IEg ( 'oa ) t )  ~ . Since the classification process can be regarded assorting the calculated association score  , its COnl puta-tional complexity can be O ( IEg ( vj ) I logIEg ( ~j ) l ) if efficient sorting algorithms such as quick sort are employed  . 
6 Experiment and Evaluation
This section gives the results of a small exper-5The association score A ( CS~ , fjIvj ) is calculated from the whole set Eg(v's ) , not Eg . 
6Although the classification process itself guarantees the disjointness of Eg  ( va , eel , f'sl ) ,   . . . , Eg(vj , CE k , fJk ) , the subordinate-superordinate constraint of c , ,~ , and fj in the step 2 also guarantees the disjointness of the example sets which satisfy the restrictions of mep ~ irs  ( c  ~ , DJ ,  .   .   . , ( c ~, i's ~) . 
7Let l's,d's ~ and ds ~ . be the maximum number of Japanese cases in a bilingual surface ease structure  , the depths of the Japanese and English thesauri , respectively . Then , given a bilingual surface case structure e , the number of Japaxiese case-class frames f . s which is superordinate oe ( i . e . , e ~ f f's ) is less than 2 ? x d ~' , an ( t the mtm ber of possible pairs of c ~ and f's is less than  2 ? xdt/xdF , , which is constant .

6.1 Example of kau
First , we show the result of classifying 75 examples ( represented as bilingual surface ease structures ) of the Japanese polysemous verb kau . 
As the result of searching for pairs of an English class and a Japanese case-class frame with a large association score  , the wo case ( the accusative case ) is preferred as the most effective case for sense classification  .   15 pairs of an English class and a Japanese case -class frame are found and the set of the  75 examples are divided into 15 disjoint clusters ( Table 1 )  . Each cluster is represented as a pair of the class c ~ of the English predicates and the class ca of the Japanese case element nouns of wo case  , along with the level of the class in the thesaurus and the example word  . English classes are taken from Roget's Thesaurus and Japanese classes fi'om BGHs  . In both thesauri , leaf classes S The classes of BGH are represented as numer-correspond to one word  . 
For the evaluation of the results , we hand-classified the 15 clusters into four groups , each of which corresponds to only one sense of kau  9  . 
Most hand-classified clusters for kau consist of more than one clusters found by maximizing the association score  . However , these clusters are cot-rect in that none of them contains examples of more than one hand -classified senses of kau  . 
6 . 2 Examples of Intransitive/Transitive
Distinction
For four Japanese verb sharu , hiku , hiraku , and kanau , Table 2 shows examples of classifying in-transitive /transitive senses by the proposed sense icM codes  , in which each digit denotes the choice of the branch in the thesaurus  . The classes starting with '11' ,  '12' ,  '13' ,  '14' , and '15' are subordinate to abstract-relations , aqents-of . human-activities , human-activities , products and natural-objects-and-natural -phenomena  , respectively . 
9The criterion of this hand-classification is taken from the existing Japanese dictionaries for human use and the hand-compiled Japanese case frame dictionary 
IPAL ( IPA , 1987).

( ; 77 Conclusion This pal ) er proposed at ) ilingual classbased method for sense classification of verbal i  ) olysemy , which is based on the maximization of the bilingual class/frame association score  . It achieved fairly high accuracy , although it is necessary to farther merge the clusters so that exactly one clus--ter corresponds to one hand-classified sense  . We are planning to make experiments on sense classi-fication without bilingual information to evaluate the e  . lt'ectiveness of such bilingual information . 
li ' or 9 verl ) s , we made a next ) eriment on sense classification of verbal polysemy  . We compared the result with the hand-class if ication adchecked whether each cluster contained examples of only one hand-classitied sense  ( Table 3 )  . In the table , ' CI . ' and ' lEg . ' indicate the numbers of ellis=ters and examples  , respectively . The column ' One Sense ( Jluster ' means that each cluster contains examples of only one hand-classified sense  , and the sub-eo hmms ' CI . ' and ' Eg . ' list the number of SlLch ( : lusters and the sum of examples contained in such clusters  , respectively . We ewduated the accuracy of the method am the rate of the number of examples contained in one sense clusters as in the ' Eg  . ' sub-eo hmm . This achieved 100% accuracy for four verbs out of the 9 verbs , and 93 . 3% in average . The coluin n ' Total C1 . /H and - Class if . ' indicates the ratio of the total number of clusters to the number of hand-classified senses  , correspoading to the average number of clnsters into which one hand-classified sense is divided  . Itsa , verag % median , and standard deviation are 2 . 46, 1 . 80, and 1 . 06, respectively . 
The result of the experiment indicated that the t ) r< ) posed sense classification method has achieved almost pure classification  , while the result seems a little liner than h and -elassitieation  . This is mainly cause < l by the Net that clusters which correspond to the same hand-classified sense are separately located in the human-made thesaurus  , and it is not easy to find exactly one representative class in the thesaurus  ( Utsuro ,  11995) . It is necessary to further merge the clusters so that exactly one cluster corresponds to one hand -classified sense  .
