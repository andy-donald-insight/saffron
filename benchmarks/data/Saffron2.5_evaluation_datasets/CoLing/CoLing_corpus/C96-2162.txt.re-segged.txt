This paper presents a unified theory of verbal ironyt br developing a computational model of irony  . The theory claims that an ironic utterance implicitly com-municates the fact that its utterance situation is surrounded by ironic environment which has three properties  , but hearers can assume an utterance to be ironic even when they recognize that it implicitly communicates only two of the three properties  . Implicit communication of three properties is accomplished in such a way that an utterance alludes to the speaker's expectation  , violates pragmatic principles , and implies the speaker's emotional attitude . This paper also describes a method for computationally formalizing ironic environment and its implicit communication using situation theory with action theory  . 
1 Introduction
Although nonliteral anguage such as metaphor has become a popular topic in computational linguistics  ( Fass et al ,  1991) , no attention has been given to ironic uses of language  . One reason for this imbalance is that traditional accounts of irony-and even default logic for lnalization  ( Perrault ,  1990 ) - assume that irony communicates the opposite of the literal meaning  . This assumption leads to the misconception that irony is governed only by a simple inversion mechanism  , and thus it has no theoretical interest . Another reason is that studies of irony have been regarded as of no practical use for NLP systems  . However , recent accounts denying the meaning-inversion assumption have revealed that irony is a more complicated pragmatic phenomenon governed by several mental processes  ( Kumon-Nakamnra et al ,  1995) , and dmtirony offers an effective way of accomplishing w ~ rious communication goals that are diff \] culto convey literally  ( Roberts and Kreuz ,  \]994) . 
The aim of this paper is to propose a unified theory of irony that answers to three crucial questions in an unequivo calmanner :  ( Q1 ) what are properties that distinguishir on y from non-ironic utterances  ,   ( Q2 ) how do hearers recognize utterances to be ironic , and ( Q3 ) what do ironic utterances convey to he~rers ? Our theory provides a computationally feasible framework of irony as the first  , step toward a fullfledged computational model of irony  , and it can account for several empirical findings fi ' ompsycholinguistics  . The essential idea underlying our theory is that an ironic utterance implicitly displaysironic environment  , a special situation which has three properties for being ironic  , but the hearer does not have to see all the three properties implicitly communicated in order to recognize the utterance to be ironic  . Note that this paper focuses only on verbal irony  , and thus situation alirony I(i . e . , situations are ironic ) is beyond the scope of our theory . 
This paper is organized as follows : Section 2 discusses the problems of previous irony theories . 
Section 3 presents our unified theory of irony that can cope with the problems  , and its computational formalization . Finally , Section 4 suggests that our theory agrees well with several empirical findings  . 
2 Previous theories of irony
Severalirony theories have been proposed in the last few decades  , but all the theories , as we will explain , make the same mistake in that they confuse the two difl'erent questions  ( Q1 ) and ( Q2 )  . 
The traditional pragmatic theory ( Grice , 1975; Haverkate , 1990) assumes that , an utterance is recognized to be ironic when tile hearer becomes aware of an apparent violation of some pragmatic principles  ( e . g , , the maxim of quality or the sincer-ity conditions for speech acts  )  , and as a result it conveys the opposite of the literal meaning  . This theory , howew , ~ r , colnpletely fails to explain manyironic utterances  . First , irony can be comnmni-cared by various expressions that do not include such violation : true assertion such as  ( 2a ) in Figure 1 , under statements such as (2c ) , and echoic utterance such as (5a ) . Moreover , Candy's husband of Example i cant ) erceive C and y's ~ ttter-ances ( la ) ~ ( le ) asironic even under the situation where he does not know or is careless of C and y's expectation of satisfy her hunger  , in other words , where he is not aware of the viQlation . This im-1Situational irony can be indicated by metarefer-ential expressions such as " It is ironic that  . . . " , but verbalirony is in comt ) a tible with such expressions . 

Example 1: Candybakedapizza to satisilgher hunger . When she was dishing it , uI ) , her husband entered t ; he kitchen and gobbled up the whole pizza . C and y said to her huslmnd : (1) a . I'm not hungry at all . 
b . Have you seen my pizza on the table ? c . I'll gel ; to sleep . 
d.I'm really satisfied to (', at the pizza.
e . How about another small slice of pizza ? Exmnple 2: Amother asked herson to (  ; lea . ituphismessy room , but he did as lol ) py , half hearted job . Alterawhile , she discovered that his room is still messy , and said to herson : (2) 2 . I love children who keep their rooms clean , in ( leed . 
I / . Would you mind if I asked you to clean up your room  , please ? c . This room may 1) eslightly messy . 
Example 3: l'eter broke his wife's favorite tea ( : ul ) when he washed the dishesawkwardly . I , ooking at the broken cup , his wife said : (3) a . Thank you furwashing my cup carefully . 
b . Thank you for (: rashing my treasure.
Example 4: Nancy and Jane werel ) lamfing a trip to the beach , but that day was a coht and storm yone . As she looked out the window , Nancy slid : (4) a . ( ) It , the weather is really ni (: e . 
b . Mayl ) e the 1) each is crowded with people.
Example 5: Just after his colleague Jesse said to him " Pd be promoted before you "  , Peter replied : (5) a . You'd be promoted before in e , huh 7b . You'd better work harder . 
Figure 1: Five examples of ironic utterances plies that violation of pragmatic principh '  . s is not an answer to ( Q2) . Secondly , it is not an answer to ( Q1 ) because of its incompetence to discriminate irony from other nonliteral utterances  ( e . g . , alie ) in which the . maxim of quality is tlouted . Finally , the notion of " the opt ) osite of the literal meaning " is problematic because it  , is aplflicable only to declarative assertions hut manyironic utterances can take non-declarative forms : questions such as  ( lb )  ; request such as (2b ) ; offerings such a . s(le ); and expressive such as (3a ) . 
Other recent theories e . g . , mention theory ( Wilson and Sperber ,  1992 ) and echoicrem in der theory ( Kreuz and Ghmksberg ,  1989 ) share a common view that by mentioning or alluding to someone's thought  , utterance , expectation or (: nl-tural norm , an ironic utterance communicates a speaker's att itude toward a discrepancy between what actually is and what  , hasheen expected . 
This view may be essential to irony , but these theories ark still incomplete as a comprehensive framework h  ) rirony for at least three reasons . 
First , their concepts of mention/allusion Sper-her and Wilson's echoic interpretation and Kreuz and Glueksberg'sechoicreminder are too narrow to capture the all usivell at tn'e of irony  ( e . g . , ( lb ) , (le ) ,  (41))) , and they are not clear enough to be formalized in a computable fashion  , l , brexample , Nancy's utterance ( 4a ) in Fignre 1 ix an echoic interpretation of Nancy's expectation of the fine  , weather , bttt ( 4b ) does not interpretively echoany states of affairs :  ( 4b ) is an implication derived from the failed expectation  . Second , they implicitly assume that the properties that characterize irony can be at  ) plied to recognition of ironic utterances as they stand or they do not focus oil how hearers recogl fize utterances to  , )(; i roni (- . Thils they cannot also explain a certain kind of ironi  ( : utterances in which hearers are not aware of any pragmatic violation  . Finally , these theories provide no plausible explanation of howirony is discriminated flom non-ironic echoic utterances  . 
Allusional pretense theory ( Kumon-Nakamura et al ,  1995 ) is the most powerfll lone in that it can explain ironic utterances of five speech act classes using the two crucial notions of allusion  ( including echoic interpretation and reminder ) and pragmatic in sincerity . They ( :laimed that allironic utterances allude to a faile de  , xpe , ctation and violate one of the felicity conditions for well-ibrmed speech acts  . However , allusional pretense theory still sut\[ersDora the same disadvantage as other theories : their notion of allusion is not clear enough  , and it does not focus on howhearers rec-Ogllize l l t t  , erallt ; est ; obeironic . 
3 A unified theory of irony 3 . 1 Ironic Environtnent and Its Inlplicit
Display
Our unitied theory of irony claims as an mmwerto ( Q1 ) that irony is a figure of Sl ) eeeh that in q ) lie-itly displays the fact that its utter aime situation is surrounded by ironic environment  . To make this (: lailn realizable , we must explain two important notions : ironic eilvironment and implicit display  . 
In order for an utterance to be ironic , a speaker nmst utter in a situations m ' rounded by ironicen-vironmeut  . Given two temporalo eatkms to and tt such that to temporally precedes t  , , the utter-ante situation where an utterance is given is surrounded by ironic  , envir ( mm cnt if and only if it satisfies the following three conditions :  1  . The speake , r has an expe (: tation E att ~) . 
2. The speaker's expectation Efails at h.
3 . As a result , the speaker has a negative emotional attitude toward the incongruity between what is expected and what actually is  . 
Note that our notion of speaker's expect aions subsumes cultually expected norms and rules  . Furthermore previous theories assume echoicirony like  ( 5a ) to allude to other person's thoughts or

For example , the speaker's expectation of ( 5a ) is that Jesse knows he cannot be promoted betbre Peter  . 
Ironic environment can be classified into the following t burtypes  . 
? a speaker's expectation E can be caused by an action A performed by intentional agents-E failed because A failed or cannott  ) e performed by another action B ( type-l ) -Efailed because A was not performe ( t ( type 2 ) ? a speaker's expectation E is not normally caused by any intentional actions 
E failed by an action I3 ( type 3 ) -E accidentally failed ( type 4 ) For example , ironic environment of Example1 falls in type-l : C and y's expectation of staying her hunger can be realized by an action of eating apizza  , but her husband's action of eating tile whole pizzah indered her expected action  . In the same way , ironic environments of Examples 24 fall in type-2~type-4  , respectively , and that of Example 5 falls in type 3 . 
An utternace implicitly displays all the three conditions for ironic environment when it  1  . alludes to the speaker's expectation E , 2 . includes pragmatic in sincerity by intentionally violating one of pragmatic principles  , and 3 . implies the speaker's emotional attitude toward the failure of E  . 
For example , utterances ( 2 ( 1 ) and ( 2e ) tbrExam-pie 2 are notironic even when they are given in the situation surrounded by ironic environment :  ( 2 ( 1 ) and ( 2e ) directly express the speaker's expectation and tiles t  ) eaker's emotional attitude , rest ) ectively , and both do not include pragmatic in sincerity . 
(2) d.I've expected a clean room.
e.I'm disat)t ) ointed with the messyroom.
On the other hand , all the utterances of Figure 1 are ironic because they implicitly express the three comt  ) onents of ironic enviromnent , as we will show in Sections a . a-a . s . 
3 . 2 Represent ing I ronic Env i ronment In order to formalize ironic utterances and ironic enviromnent illa coint  ) utational fashion , we use situation theory ( Barwise ,  1 . 989) and situation calculus . Our representational scheme includes discrete items of intbrmation called infons  , situations capable of making in fonstrue ( i . e . , supt ) orting in-fons ), and actions . For example , information that C and yeats the pizza is represented as the infon  ( ( eat , x , a ) > in which x and a denote " C and y " and " the pizza "  , and its negation as (( ca * , ,x , a ; 0)) . 
A fact/even that C and yeats dmpizza is represented as t ~  ( ( eat , x , a ) ) where the situation t expresses the spatiotemporal location of that event  . A ilaction of eating the pizza performed by C and y is expressed by tile predicate at  ( x , a ) and its negation ( i . e . , an action of not perfbrm-ing eat ( x , a )) by = ~; at(x , a ) . The state of all ah's that an action A is perfbrmed is expressed by  ( ( did , A . Also , a proi ) osition p expressing the claim that C and yeats the pizza is written as  ( t  ~ ( ( eat , x , a )) . The proposition p = ( s ~ c,)

3.4 Pragmatic Insincerity
Table 2 lists the t ) i ' agmatic principles violated by their onic utterances in Figure  1  . \[ nm any ( : ases an ironic utterance is pragl natically in sincere ill the sense that it intentionally violates one of the preconditions in Figure  3   ( i . e . , sincerity , preparatory and propositional conditions ) that need to hold before its illocution ary act is accomplished  , but pragmatic in sincerity also oe curs when an utter-ane eviolates other pragl naticl  ) rineiples .

3.5 Emotional Attitude
Speakers can use a variety of signals/cues intonation contour  , exaggerated stress , tone of voice , hyperbole , facial expression , etc . for implicitly communicating their emotional attitude  . The use of the interjection " Oh " with a special tone of voice in  ( 4a ) offers one typical example of this . 
Implicit communication can also be accomplished by utterances explicitly referring to the pleased emotion that speakers would experience if their failed expectation became true  . For example , the utterance ( 3a ) explicitly expresses speaker's counterfactual emotion  . 
At the same time , manyironic utterances make emotion-elieiting rules for the speaker's attitude  ( some of which are shown in Figure 4 ) accessible by the ' hearers by alluding to one of premises of the rule  . In the case of (3a ) , it alludes to Peter's action of washing the dishes so that the rule for " angry ~ t " emotion becomes more accessible  . 
3.6 Recognizing and Interpreting Irony
In many cases , all the three components for implicit communication of ironic environment are easily recognized by the hearer  . As we mentioned in Section 2 , however , there are also many cases such as Example 1 that an utterance can be iron-ically interpreted even though all the three components cannot be recognized by the hearer because the hearer's mental situation differs from the speaker's one  . Furthermore , in the case of (5a ) , after recognizing the utterance to be ironic Jes seturns out to know that the speaker Peter thinks Jesse cannot be promoted before Peter  . 
Hence we propose the following condition for recognizing irony as an answer to  ( Q2 ) : Hearers can assu I no an utterance to heironic ( with high possibility ) if they can recognize that the utterance implicitly displays at least two of the three components for ironic environment  , and if the utterance situation does not rule out the possibility of including tile unrecognized components  , if any This "2-of-3" criterion makes it possible that hearers can recognize utterances asironic even though speakers do not intend their utterances to be understood asirony  . It , provides empirical evidence of ( ) lit ' theory since such unintentional irony has been found in a number of psychological experiments  ( Gibbs and O'Brien ,  1991) . 
By recognizing an utterance to be ironic , the hearer becomes aware of an illocution ary act of irony  , that of conveying the fact that the utterance situation is surrounded by ironic environment  ( i . e . , all the three components for ironic environment hoht in a current situation  )  . That is an answer to ( Q3) , and then the hearer inter-prets/understands the ironic utterance by adding that information to his/hermental situation  . In 2Practically speaking , whether an utterance isironic is a matter of degree  . Thus the degree of ironic-ity might t ) ea better criterion for recognizing irony . 
If we can quantitatively evaluate , though do , to t in this paper , to what degree an utterance alludes to the speaker's expectation  , to what degree it includes pragmatic in sincerity , and to what degree it implies the speaker's emotional attitude  , we think the proposed condition for recognizing irony can also be quantitatively defined  . 
966 many cases , sin ( : e the hearer already knows the fact that the three components hold in the sit-us \] ion  , interpretation of irony results in confirmation of the mosl  ; uncertain information , that is , the speaker's emotional attitude . However , when the hearer does not recognize all components  , he/she also ol ) tains new information that the unrecognize . d component holds in a current situation . Therefore , our the . ory includes many previous theories claiming that irony  ( : ommunicates an ironist's emotional attitude . For example , in the . case of (5a ) , after recognizing Peter's utterance ( 5a ) to beir on \] ( ' , Jes seturns out to know that Peter drinks Jesse's t  ) receding ut term me is absurd , and tries to confirm Peter's emotional attitude by interpreting  ( 5a ) ironically . Furthermore , as we mentioned in Section 1 , nilironic utterance achieves various ( : olm nunieation goals held t ) y the sl ) eakere . g . , to be huinorous , to enq ) hasizea I ) oint , to clarify as I ) erlocutionary acts . 
4 hnplications of the Theory
Distinction between ironic and non-ironicut terances : Our theory  ( ' and isl ; inguishir on \] (" utterances from non-iron \]( ; ones . For exmnple , lies and other non-ironicutt ( wances violating the pragmatic principle do not allude to any antecedent exi  ) ectation and/or ( lo not offer cues fi ) rreasoning about the si ) e . a ker's emotional attitude . 
Non-ironice cho\] ( : utterances do not include pragmatic in sincerity and/or do notirn plicitly communicate the speaker 's attitude  . 
Ironic cues : Some theories assmne that irony can be identified by special cuest T or irony  , but the empirical finding in psychology shows that people can interpretiron \]  ( : statements without any sI ) e-cial intonational cues ( Gibbs and O'Brien ,  1991) . 
Our theory agrees with this finding : such kind of cuesis only al  ) art of Component 3 as we described in Section 3 . 5 , and thusiron \] (" ul ; teranees without these cues cant ) e recognized as ironic . 
Victims of irony : Severalirony studies , e . g . , ( Clark and Gerrig ,  1984) , have t ) ointed out that irony generally has victims . Our \[ theory suggesl , sth ; ~ tironicul ; l ; eranc (' . shave potential vi ( : tims when their iroific environments fall in one . of types-l , 2 , 3: in the ease of type 1 or type 3 an agent of 13I ) e-comes a victim , and i , l the case of type2 an agent of A becomes a victi in .

5 Conclusion
In this paper we have proposed a unified theory of irony that overcomes several difficulties of previous irony theories  . Our theory allows us to Rive plausible answers to whatirony is  , howirony is recognized and whatirony coin muni ( : at es . The properties of irony allusion , pragmatic in sin-eer il , y , and emotional attitude arc formalized mmquivo ( : ally enough to build a coIn putational model of irony  . From this I ) o into t ' view , we believe that this pal ) er provides a basis \ [ or dealing with irony in NLP systems  , and we are develol ) -ing computational methods for intert ) reting mat generating irony ( Utsumi ,  1995) .
