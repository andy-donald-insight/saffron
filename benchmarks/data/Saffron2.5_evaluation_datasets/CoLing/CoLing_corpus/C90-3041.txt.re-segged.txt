words and semantic classes of

made on the basis of a
sufficiently representative
corpus of Russian texts.
One of the basic components of
the system is its lexicon ; the
lexicon contains information not
only about individual lexer~s,
but also about sen~ntic and
syntactic classes of lexemes.
Thus , for nominal lexe ~ es such
features are ~ iven as : " NATURAL

linguists to lay the strongest

will be to attract

in this paper
attention to
those semantic properties of
verbs that affect their
combinability and still are
common to more or less numerous
verb classes.
Thus , combinability of verbs
with subordinated noun phrases
or adverbials designating place,
time ~ re & ~ on ~ purpose ~
Instrun ~ nt and other parameters
of the situation denoted by a
predicate ( taken together with
its arguments ) was usually.
assumed to be non-restricted.
This is definitely not the case,
and the problem deserves special
attention . There are some well
known important observations
made in this area . Thus , as is
known , one of the Vendlerian
classes-accomplishment verbs -
is singled out by the fact that
some verbs combine with a
special kind of time adverbials,
such as in two hours ; these
adverbials designate a period of
ti ~ redur ' in ~ which

in Ferent limit.
In what follows

E . o ao ~ , ? ? to be hungry ? , rmaB ~ ? drunk ? etc for which localizat ioni  . n time is possible . Another " cl, . _~s with the s , m ~ e combinatorial properties is constitu ted by causative verbs denoting " situations that ~ ivestates a ~ s their  , results , cf . pa-~O ~ aT ~" to cause joy ? , o ~ opq a Tb ? togrieve " , pe~oMeH ~ oP , aTb " to reoo~t ~ llen d " , 8 St ' PITh " tol:rk : % kean\[ry " etc . Note especially verbs denotins changes in social state such as OS  ; flOBeT b : to become , awidow ' . 
Verbs of these semm\]tic cl~?sses do not a\] . low of place or ' time adver ' bials ( of all tirre adverbials only those cooccur  , with such verbs that denotes uper-lon ~ in tervals  , such as pa~e " before " , BMOJIO ~\[ OOTH " in the youth " , loa~a-TO " long a ~ o ' , cf .  \[5\]) . 
In order to explanation restraints of ~ ive semantic oF ''~' ~ CO-OCOUr  . r ~ c ~ a verb it is some t in ~ s necessary to use a more exact classification of time modifier ' s  .

~ . ? ? There is a J-~interest_in~dist . inction that has r , et~ined unnoticed uptill now , nm~ely , a distir ~ t . ion'r'-between c:oncr . ~ . t~ . _  . . _ and non-concrete verbs . A verb is ? x ~ r ~ , -et e if it designates ( in a proper context ) as it . uation that is supposed to go throufi'ha series of phases in its natural development each of which can be fi'iven a detailed descr~p  . ion . 
Indeed , for a situation described by a verb de ; wa Tb ? to run ? or , pea a Tz ~? to cut " ( both of them concrete ) it is always possible to say , for every fixed ~ on ~ nt , what the subject involved in the situation is doing at this moment  . On the other hand , there are verbs that p~esent the situation in such a way that they emphasize the final result of the action described while therrea~s used in order to achieve this result remain in the shadow  ; and tt ~ is semantic feature characteristic of " their use ~'~ dunderstanding " lexicograph ic representation  . We call such verbs r~-~rete . 
Thus , OTOMOT MT bmeans " to reven ~ e one self for " an evil committedeaz'lier "  ; but the means used in order to attain this goal are irrelevant  . As a consequence , no concrete phases can be discerned in the action denoted by this verb : the verb 
OTO~CT ~ Crb does not express " an unfolding a ~ tion  "  , even when used in the Imperfective . The same is true for the verb ncn op-T~"to spo i l "  , which is also non-concrete : ~ cnopTzT ~ means " to deprive of the possibility of normal functioning '  ; but the way in which this deprivation is fu l filled is irrelevant for the meart in ~ of the wor'd~soit+has no phases  , it does not denote a develop in \[ process . 
Non-concrete verbs very often are aspectually defective  ; namely , they either have no
Imperfective or , be in ~ used in the Imperfective , they lack
Progressive meaning . Thus , amon ~ the verbs that , accordin ~ to Ju . 
Apresjan \[7\] belong to the class of the socalled momentary verbs  ( achievements in Vendler's terminology ) and thus lack a
Pro~r . essive mean in ff there is a major group of verbs that owe their momentarihes s to non- concreteness  ; cf . noSe ; ~ TaT ~" to win " , " to succeed '; aa OTM8 a Tb , 8 a OT a Ba Tb ; PIBMeHSTb < po1\[PIHe > ; sapy wa Thrlpa BZgIO " to violate ther ' ule " ; o ~ xoT ~ f Pb8al ~ OH " to 2344 violate f "+ ~ .   .   .   .   .   .   . +_+tt . .

3 . Not every predicate can c , jo-occur ' with such ac , ,ot~mo~t - - tvoe . of verb-complement as Benefac-tive ( expressed in Russian with the help of the proposition ~\ [ Jzs " for '  )   . Thus , it is impossible to say ~ dO ~ TbO ~ , ~ dZSI < O~O-Jn4dO " to be a Zr . aid for'stub , '*' Sa~CT bc ~-' smb ~ . rl~l-eoso-JII4 ~ o't . oswe ~" for '-' etc . These restrictions are easily deducibly from serremtic decomposition of the Benefact ive construction : XP ~ a ~ Y = " X did 
Phaving " in mind to provide Y with the result of P '  . It , follows from this decomposition that a predicate for which this construction is possible must denote art action that is both a contr  , olle done and ar ~ action havin ~" some_ , definite result . 
This is ~ hyUene fachire complement cannot cooccur with the verb dOa TbCa  , denotin ~ non-controlled state , or with the verb ~ wi ~ cTbca , denotin\[anaction with no result . 
It is a wellknown fan~t that verbs denotin~non -controlled actions normally do not cooccur with a modifier of purpose  ; thus , such question m-~*Sa~e ~ ~\] ~ OTc ~ ea ? ~ a ~ eMMope ~  , y ~ fT ? ~ edeviant ( questions about the cause of such states are normal : flov  , e~yH \] I eTcries ? l-lo~e ~ vMope
Thus , if the diction ~' y contains information about the feature CONTROL  , then the behavior of a verb with : respech to a modifier of " purpose becomes predict ab le  .

Predicates in ( 3 ) denote states that are called determinate i n\  [6 \]: these states develop in ti 1~ accordins " to their owr ~ laws ~~- ~ clit . is impossible f ' or the subjecs t to chan ~ e h is state of his own accord  , And this se~nt . ic feature """ expia ~ nst . he differenc , e between ( S ) awl (4),
