A PROGRESS REPORTON
THEUSE OF SLANT GRAM MARCAL CULUSFOR
AUTOMATICANALYSIS
Ferenc Kiefer
The KVAL-approach to syntactic analysis has been based on categorial grammar as propounded by Bar-Hillel and Lambek  . 
It was clear at the very out set that the orig in al form of categorial grammar is not sui table for the purpose of automatized syntact icanalysis in practice  . The first attempts at developing a more adequate notation as well as at the closer examination of various properties of categor i algram margo back to  1965 and 1966 /KVALPM Z37  ,  248 ,  298 ,  302/  . In order to distinguish our approach from original categorical grammar we have te rmed its lant grammar calculus  . 
Our practical concern has been to write a grammar for Swedish nominal phrases which would enable us to automatize some linguistic aspects of documentation research  . Such a grammar has been compiled by Bengt Svensson  . The rules utilize lexical and dmorphological information  . In other words , no strict line is drawn between morphological and syntactic rules  . A substantial part of this preliminary grammar has already been checked generatively by means of a special string processing algorithm/STRIP  /   . 
As known one of the most tedious problems in connection with categorial grammar is the great number of categories assign able to most " of the units in the string to be an a lyzed  . This is a parexcellence : practical prob lembut it does not lack the or-etical imp lications  . The most interesting of these can be roughly phrased as follows : If syntax is to be kept as simple as possible  , then the lexicon will get complicated . If we aim at the optimal simplific at ion of the lexicon  , then the burden of our grammar will be taken over by syntax  .   ( Recall that in categorial grammar we have on ly two rules for the bidirectional case  . Therefore , all possible syntactic functions for each lexical entry must be listed in the lex icon  .   ) Now we may ask questions about the optimal di stribution of tasks of a grammar between syntax and lexicon in order to achieve an overall simplification in grammatica l descrip-tion  .   ( Notice that the same question can be asked wi th respect to syntax and semantics  , or still better , with respect to syntax , se-mantics and the lexicon . ) This problem has , of course , not yet been solved and consequently , one is forced to work in general with severa l alternatives  . 
On the other hand , one can neglect this theoretical issue
P and concentrate on strategies that would lead to an essential re-duction of the poss ible ambiguities for a given string  . Some pro-posals to this effect can be found in KVAL PM  327 and 373  . One of these strategies follows the usual path : the point is being made that the estab lishment of the correct syntactic struc ture/or struc-tures/should be carr ied out in several/at least two/steps  . 
Thus , instead of having rules of the form a/bb-~ a/i/a a\b-~b we write rules like/Z /xoy-~z which may mean either 
Z/X X-~Z or
XX\Z-*Zin/z/we neglect the dominance relation/see below/holding between the two constituents and also their linear o rder  . For the latter point notice that/Z/cor responds to two phrase structure-type rules : z~a+b  /3 /z ~ b + a where + stands for concatenation . 
As to the dominance relation it stands to reason to interpret z/x in a string z/x x as being the head or governor of the cons-t ruction  . Similarly , for a string x x\z we would say that x is governed by xIz  . In view of the way the cancellation rules of the slant gr&mmar calculus are built up we may say that the " more complex " or " longer " category is the governor of a given expression  . This information is clearly lost in /2/ . 
However , as specified in Interim Report NoI , we are not forced to make this interpretation . The slant calculus as such lends itself to phrase structure grammar too  , context-free or context-sensitive . 
Instead of/l/our grammar would now contain a set of statements of the form/Z/:a Iob I = c  1   /4 /azobz : cz ,   . * aobcnnn Each statement in /4/ corresponds to a syntagm type in the given grammar  . Of course , it is not necessary to have binary rules only  . One might also have a Ioa2o .   .   . am=clet c Now a string of categories in terms of our slant grammar calculus can cancel to a " simpler " category if  , and only if , one of the rules chemata in /4/ holds . But ~ tset of such schemata will yield many different categorial grammars  , varying as to the inter-pretation of dependency  , With the help of /4 /one can determine a sort of " deep " struc ture for a given sequence of morphemes  . 

After having determined this deep structure we can proceed by finding out more about the actual structure  . 
Another approach consists of combining the a forementioned multi-level method with probabilistic considerations  . For details see KVAL Interim Report No12 . 
Since we have interpreted categories in terms of dependencies it is readily seen that slant grammar calculus can be considered as a dependency-type grammar  . The dependency statement for the rules /1 /can be rendered as /5 /: a/b ( ~\[ b \] )  . 
a\b(\[a\]x )
We fully subscribe to the view that the determination of the head or governor of a const ruction is an important and indispensable task  . /See , also , Jane Robinson / Therefore , we think that dependency grammar in whatever notational conventions it is expressed  , is superior to phrase structure grammar . Jane Robins on has ar-gued that many trans formations need a reference to the head of construction which in usual phrase struc ture grammar can only be Provided by some ad hoc device  . All considerations with respect to dependency grammar hold with equal force with respect to slant grammar calculus  . The latter can be used as a base for transform -ations in the same way as dependency grammar can  . Following Robins on we may make use of the following notational concentions that differentiate dependency structures from phrase structures : we may use asterisks to mark governing occurrences  , parentheses to mark boundaries and a special pair of symbols/labels /  , denoting a variable depth of nesting . For example , ( A*B ~() = > 2I 3123 . In other words , the transformation rule applies to a family of trees with the structure 
A/e/~,\XiS``.
/" " , /s ?/ s"~ and as a result we get a family with the structure 

IS ?/ ~./?/ Robins on , op . cit . pp . 2627/.
It is now of little importance what the symbols A , B and X denote , i . e . whether they denote categories characteristic of dependency grammar or of slant grammar calculus  . We can thus conceive of a grammar that has as its base / " categorial component "/ a de-pendency -tTpegrammar which is contextfree and a transformational component that operates on structures generated by the categorial----  .   .  "  .   . 
component . In this case we can expect from slant grammar calculus a notational advantage at best  . 
In fact , this seems to be the case . Thus , in many cases one can take advantage of the resemblance between categories of the slant g rammar calculus and ordinary fractions  . Under certain conditions we can determine the type of syntagm by assigning to each symbo l in the sequence of categories a prime number and then carry out the cancellation in a nar ith metical sense  . Then , sequences of category symbols in the slant g rammar calculus can easily be handled wi thout any reference to their meanings  . Several proposals have been worked out that take advantage of exactly this trait/KVAL PM  367/   . One definement is proposed in Interim Repor t  5  , where relatively prime 2 xZ matrixes with integer ele-ments are assigned to the atoms of any categorial g rammar  , so that a string is grammatical if , and only if , the product of the assigned matrixes is equal to some " unit "  . 
On the other hand , we may ask to what extent transforma-tional rules are really necessary for our purpose  . Could they not all be replaced by context- sensitive rules ? This problem has been examined in some detail in Interim Reporti f  . Another kind of categorial symbols , with selectors as well as numerators and denominators and the cancellation rule  /5 / were proposed in order to cover the context- sensitive case instead of/l/:xlly y-x y and in " mixed " cases :  /6/ uzzull xlyllv Vy-~UXV Some formal quest ions concerning the various grammars in the f rame work of slant grammar calculus have been tackled in H  . Karlgren : Multi-index Syntactic Calcu lus  . 
So far it is not clear whether rules of type /5 / or /6 /will solve all our problems . But it is in this direction that we want to work next  .
