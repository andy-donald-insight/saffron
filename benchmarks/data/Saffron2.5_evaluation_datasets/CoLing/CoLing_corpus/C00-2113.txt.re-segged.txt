1 Introduction
Th . ere has been a . continuous interest in corpus-based approa . cheswhich retrieve words and expressions in connection with a specific domain  ( we call them technical terms here a . fter ) . They may correspond to syntactic phra . sesor components of syntactic relationships and ha  . vebeen found useful in various application area . s , including inibrmation e?tra . ction , textsumlna . -riza . tion , and ma . chinetra . nsla . tion . Am . ong others , a . knowledge of technica \] terminology is in -dispensa  . ble for machine tra . nsla . tion beca . use usage and mea . ning of technica . 1 terms a . reoften quite different from their literal interpret a  . tion . 
Onea . pproa . ch for identifying technical terminology is a . rule-ba . seda . pproa . eh which learns l . oca . 1 syntactic patterns from a training corpus . A variety of methods ha . vebeen developed within this fra . mework , ( Ra . msha . w , 1995) ( Arga . -monetal , 1999) ( Ca . rdie and Pierce , 1 . 999) a . nd achieved good results for the considered ta . sk . 
Surprisingly , though , little work ha . sbeen d . e-voted to lea . rning local syntactic pa . tterns besides noun phrases . Another drawback of this a . pproach is tha . tit requires substa . ntiM training corpora , in many cases with pa . rt-of-speech tags . 
A n . alternative approa . ch is a . statistic alone which retrieves recurrent word sequences as co\]loca  . tiolls(Sma . dja . , 1993) ( Ha . runo et a . 1 . , 1996) ( Shimolla . ta et a . 1 . , :1997) . This a . pproach is robust and pra . ctical because it uses t ) laintext corpora , without a . nyinibrmation dependent on a la . ngua . ge . Unlike the former N )- proa . ch , this a . pproach extra . ctsva . rious types of local pa . tterns a . t the same time . Therefore , postprocessing , such as part of speech ta . gging and syntactic category identifica . tion , is necessary when we a . pply them to NLP applica . tions .

In the pa . rsing process , the engine performs a . CFG-parsing for a . n input sentence and rewrites trees by a . pplying the source pa . tterns .   3'erminals and nonterminals are processed under thesa . mefra . lnework but lexicalized pa . tterns ha . repriority over symbolized pa . tterns 1 A plausible parse We define a symbolized pattern as a pattern without a  . terminal and ~ L lexicalizcd pattern as that with more than one terminal  , we prepares 1000 symbolized patterns a . nd130 , 0 00 lexicalizcd patterns as a system by the number of l  ) atterns applied . Then the pa . rsetree is tr~msferred into target language by using target patterns which correspond to the source patterns  .

Nonterminals are bracketed with index numbers which represents correspondence of nonterminals between the source and target pattern  .

The process is con > prised of 3 phases : retrieving local patterns , assigning their syntactic ategories with part-of -speech  ( POS ) templates , and making translation patterns . The dictionary is used when an MT system translates a text in the same domain as the corpus  . 
We assume that the input is an English corpus and the dictionary is used for an English-Japanese MT system  . In the remainder of this section , we will explain each phase in detail with
English and Japanes examples.

3.1 Retrieving local patterns
We have a h'eady proposed a method for retrieving word sequences  ( Shimohata et al ,  1997) . 
This method generates all n-character ( or n word ) strings appearing in a text and tilters outffagl -nenta  . 1 strings with the distribution of words adjacent to the strings  . This is based on the idea . that adjacent words are widely distributed if the string is meaningful  , m~d are localized if the string is a substring of a meaningful string  . 
The method introduces entropy value to measure the word distribution  . Let the string t ) e8t r , the adjacent words W l . . . w , ~, and the frequency of strfrcq ( . slr ) . The probability of each possible adjacent word p ( wi ) is then : p ( wi ) -frcq ( wi ) frcq ( str )   ( \] ) Atttla , t time ~ the entropy of , ~ trH ( . q tr ) is de-tined a . s : tl(,t , .   )  =  ( 2 ) i = 1 Calculating the entropy of both sides of , q tr , the lower one is used as ll ( , tr ) . Then the strings whose entropy is larger than a given threshold are retrieved as local pattexns  . 
3 . 2 I dent i fy ing syntact i c categories Since the strings are just word sequences  , the l ) rocess givestllem syntactic categories . For each str . str~1 . assign pa . rt-of speech tags tl , . . . t  ~ . to the coH\]ponent words W l , . . . /vr ~2 . match tag sequence t l , . . . t , ~ with part-of-speech templates 7~3 . givesir corresponding syntactic category , 5'6' i , it'it matchesTi3 . 2 . 1 Assigning part-of-speech tags The process uses a simplified part of speech set shown in table  1  . l ? unction words are assigned as they are , while content words except for adverb are fallen into only one part of speech word  . Four kinds of words " be " , " do " , "' not " , and " to " are assigned to speciM tags be , do , not , and to respectively . 
There are several reasons to use the simplitied
POS tags : ---* Identify syntactic categories

? words are often used beyond parts of speech in technical terminology ? it is eml  ) irically found that word sequences retrieved through ngram statistics have distributional concentration several syntactic categories  . 
The retbre , we think the simplified POS tags are sufficien to identify syntactic ategories  .

3.3 Making translation patterns
The process converts the strings into translation l  ) a . tterns . Thel ) roblem here is that we need to generate bilingual translation l  ) al ; terns from monolingua \] strings . We use heuristic rules on borr0wing words from foreign \] anguages . . 1 l ! ' igure 4 is an example of conversion ridest br generating English-Jal  ) an ese translation pa . t-terns . To give an exa . mple , " to opentile " in figure 3 , whose SC is vT , is converted into the following patterns in accorda  . nce with the second rule in figure 4 . 
Figured : conversion rules for generttting translation l  ) a . tterns 4 Evaluation V Vehave tested our algorithln in building a doma  . in dictionary and malting a . translation with it . A corpus used in the exl ) eriment is a COml ) utern lanual comprising 167 , 023 words ( in 22 , 0 disentences) . 
The corl ) us contains 24 , 7137 n-grooms which appear more than twice . Among them ,  7 , 6 116 strings are extracted over the entropy threshold 1  . Table 3 is a list of top 20 strings ( except for single words and function word sequences  ) retrieved from the test c ( )rptlS .

4In Japanese , foreign words , especially in technical terminology , are often used as they are in katakana ( ti Lephonetic spelling for foreign words ) followed by function words which indicate their parts of speech For example  , English verbs are followed by " suru " , a verb wliich means " do " in English .

Table 3: top 20 strings
In the matching process , we prepared 15 templates and 6SCs . Table 5 is a result of SC identification . 2,462 strings (32 . 3%) are not lnatched to any templates . The table indicates that most strings retrieved in this method are identified as N and NP  . It is quite reasonable because the majority of the technical terms are supposed to be nouns and noun phrases  .

The retrieved translation patterns total 1, 21 . 9 . Figure 5 shows an example of translation patterns retrieved by our method  . 
We , then , converted them to an MT dictionary and made a translation with and without it  . Table 6 summarizes the evaluation results translating randomly selected  1  . , 000 sentences fi'om the test corpus . Compared with the translations without the dictionary  , the translations with the dictionary improved 571 in parsing and word selection . 
Figure 6 illustrates changes in translations.
Each column consists of an input sentence , a translation without the dictionary , and a translation with the dictionary . Bold English words Table 6: Translation evaluation results correspond to underlined a apanese  . 
First two examples show improvement in word selection  . The translations of " map ( verb ) " and " exec " are changed from word-for-word transla  . tions to non-translation word sequences . 
Although " to make a map " and " exective " are not wrong translations  , they are irrelevant in the computer manual context  . On the contrary , the domain dictionary reduces confltsion caused by the wrong word selection  . 
Wrong parsing and incomplete p~rsing are also reduced as shown in the next two examples  . In the third example , " Next " should be a noun , while it is usually used as an adverb . The domain dictionary solved the syntactic ambiguity properly because it has exclusive priority over system dictionaries  . In the forth example , " double-click " is an unknown word which could cause incomplete parsing  . But the phrase was parsed as a verb correctly . 
The last one is an wrong example of Japanese verb selection  . That was a main cause of errors and declines . The reason why the undesirable Japanese verbs were selected is that

As mentioned in section 1 , there are two approaches in corpus-based technica . lterm re-trieva ha rule-based approach and a statistical a ~ p proach  . Majorditlh re:nces between the two 3 , re : ? the former uses a tagged corl Itls while the latter uses an untagged one  . 
? the former retrieves words and phrases with a designated syntactic category while the bttter : retrieves that with various syntactic categories at the same time  . 
Our method uses the latter ~ p proa , ch because we think it more practical both in resources and in applications  . 
For coln parison ~ we refer here to Smadja's method  ( 1993 ) because this method and the proposed method have much in connnon  . In both cases , technica J terms are retrieved from a . nuntagged corpus with ngram statistics and given syntactic ategories for NI  , Papplica . tions . 
The methods are difl hrent in that Sma . djauses a we use POS templates . A parser may add more precise syntactic ategory than I?OS templates  . 
However , we consider it not to be critical under the specific condition that the variety of input patterns is very small  . In terms of portability , the proposed method has an advantage . Actually , adding POS templates in ots otime consuming as developing a parser  . 
We have applied the translation patterns retrieved by this method to a real MT system  . 
As a result , 57 . 1 . % of translations were improved with 1 , 219 translation patterns . To our knowledge , little work has gone into quantifying its effectiveness to NLP applications  . We recognize that the method leaves room for improvement in making translation patterns  . We , therefore , plan to introduce techniques for finding translational equivalent from bilingual corpora  ( Me\]amed , 1998) to our method . 
6 Conclusion
We have presented a method for identifying technical terminology and building a domain dictionary tbrMT  . Applying the method to technical manuM in English yielded positive re-suits  . We have found that the proposed method would dramatically improve the performance of translation  . In the future work , we plan to investigate the availability of POS patterns which are not categorized into any SCs  .
