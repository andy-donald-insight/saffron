This was in fact already realized as early as 1973 by A . COI~4~:RAUER and his group ( CF\[COLMF / ~ AUER&ai , 73\] , \[ PASERO ,  73\] , \[COI~MERAUER ,  79\]) . In these papers these xnantics for natural languages is specified in terms of the truth conditions of predicate logic formulas into which these utterances are translated in a sys-t~natic way  .   ( It should be n~ntioned that in many respects the way these translations are obtained as well as the translations the ~ mselves resemble the even earlier proposals of MONTAGUE and his students  ( cf\[MONTAGUE ,  74\]) . The work done in COLMERAUER's group has however the addition almer it that these proposals are presented in operative syst~ns for nmn-machino dialogues  . Indeed in these early papers we find sket-ched two alternatives for the systs~mtic manipulation of the translations provided for natural language discourse : This research was supported in part by ESPRIT  , in the
ACORD project ( P393).
a ) given a database in relational ( e . g Prolog like ) form the answers to queries ( which are themselves translated into logical forms  ) ~ nhe given in terms of the satisfaction conditions of these formulas  . I . e a query like " does every student own a hook ?" will receive the answer " yes " if its translation " for a \]  . lx ( student ( x ) -> there exists y ( book ( y ) & own ( x , y ))) " is true in the data ~ is e . Here the answers to queries are obtained by simply evaluating the translation in the data base  ( or mode \] . )? b ) another approach however consists in regarding the database as a set of fomaulas and the process of answering a query as a deduction ? A query wil\]be said to be true with respect to the ~ it a \] mse if and only if it can I~<\] educed frc~n\]to  ( Naturally as in the case of the first approach , this met h(x\]app\] . i es ( ~ qual\]y well to closed sentences ( i?eyes no questions ) as well as to open sentences ( i . eW\[I-questions ) ?\] , ' or an application of this im~thodas wo\] . las for disc : ussion of its advantages ( cf\[PASERO~73\] ) ? \] .

Needless to say it : is not Loo difficult and in fact  , sclnetimes necessary ~ as we shall see below , to c<mlpl6\]nent the purese ~ nantic evaluation with deductivo capacities  . .
2-Sh:MANTICS VIATRANS~TIONIN'IY ) LOGIC Even if it is clear in nmst respects how to obtain predicate logic : translatic ms for a large w ~ riety of natura \] language sentences  , cf\[WAR\[~FM & PEREIRA ,   82\] we repeat here : \[ or the sake of clarity the essentials of the translation process in OPERA  . 
Consider for c~ample the following sentences : ( a ) Bergac < ~ npos 6 unc ~ era entro is acres ( Being composed an operain three acts )   ( b ) aucunc ~ upos iteurgl . l~mndn ' a compos4 unoperaen 1912 ( no german cc~poser composed an operain 1912 )   ( c ) Chaque operade Bergadt @ ~\] registrd par Karajane very operaby Berg was record cw\]bYI ~rajan  . 
The syntax of ~? ERA(cf\[SEDOGBO , 85\]) yields syntactic analysis as in ( d) . 
These trees are then translated into the following predicate logic formulas :  ( a ) exist ( x , opera-in-three-acts(x ) & compose ( Berg , x )) ( b ) aucun(x , composer(x ) & german(x ) , exist(y , opera(y ) & can pose-by(y , Berg ) & in ( y , 1912))) ( C ) chaque(x , opera(x ) & of(x , Berg ) , recorded-by(x , Karajan ) ) -- V ' --- AUX-=-a I --- PAST---cf~npes4 - - - OBJ - - - NP . . . .

I--NOUN---actes
Fiqure 1: an example of syntactic tree in OPERAThe evaluation component of OPERA then evaluates these formulas in the database  . Quite a few syntactically complex queries can thus be formulated in this system  . 
3-FROM TRANS LATION STODRSs
OPERA was conceived not so much as an effort towards an implementation of viable integrated natural langua-ge question answering system  , as a testing ground for a rather extensive fragment of French  . In fact many constructions ( in particular cc~plement constructions ) which are accemodated in the syntax fragn ~ nt of OPERA are such that they cannot effectively be applied in the setting of OPERA's database  . 
H ( ~ever there are quite a few constructions which can be analysed syntactically in the gra~ir but for which we are unable to specify translations  , even when their intended translations are essentially first-order logic formulas  . Foremost among these are anaphoric and elliptical contructions  . It is clear ' that any c~n pre-hensive treatment of such phenomena cannot restrict itself to the analysis of isolated sentences i  . e to isolated queries . For what could a sentence like : when did he compose it ? mean ? or what query could be expressed by the phrase " and Britten ?"? There is not much that these sentences could convey in isolation  . But consider the following dialogue : Question : did Beethoven caz pose Fidelio ? 
Answer : yes.
Question : when did he ccn koose it ?
A/iswer : in 1812
Or consider another very natural interaction : Question : how many operasdid Beethoven compose ? answer :  1 
Question : and Mozart ?
Answer : 15
It is clear that an adequate account of anaphoric and elliptic constructions must at least take into account the current situation of the dialogue  . How to define the notion " current situation " is by no means a trivial task  . For one thing we cannot simply asssume that the current situation is identical to the sequence of the question-answer pairs that make up the dialogue  . 
Much more is involved.
3 . 1 TOWARDS A TREATMENT OF ANAPHORA as far as t ~ syntaxis concerned  , no one has been able to provide a unified and systematic account of anaphoric linking  . As recent work has shown one must distinguish on the one hand various types of pronc~i-hal reference and on the other hands how how the resolution of anaphor a must appeal to common Lmderlying mechanisms  . 
It is one of the achivements in \[ KAMP ,   81\] to show the way towards that unified treatment . 
In fact we shall base our proposals for beth the treatment of m\]aphora and of ellipsis on the concepts and technics introduced by KAMP in his theory of di-scourse representation  . 
Since the current translation cx~mpenent of OPERA does not take into account pronouns at all we must first provide an extension which is also able to deal with pronominal referemce  . Syntactically pronouns can occur in all NP positions characterized bY the grammar ? We shall  1~mrk each occ\[mence of a pronoun by indica-ting its gender/number features  ; As a first step in the translation procedure we shall therefore simply take these translations to he identical with themsel-ves  . Thus the translation of sentences like :
Bergl ' a composd ( Bergc~mpesedit ) will be : co , loose ( Berg , \[ it , null , sing\] ) similarly a sentence like : chaque cc~n positeur quia  compos4 unoperal ' a enre-gistr4   ( every ccTm poser who wrote an opera recorded it )  . 
will be translated into : chaque(x , exist(y , opera(y)&composer(x)&c~npose(x , y )) , record(x , \[it , null , sing\] ) ) ) We shall call translations containing occurrences of pronouns " unresolved translations "  . Notice that contrary to the practice in \[ MONTAGUE  ,   74\] we do not index pronouns either in the syntax or the initial tranlation phase  . The resolution of anaphora will ta-ke as input " unresolve <\] translations " and yield as output a rather different type of s~nantic representation namely a discourse representation structure  ( DRS )  . 
What is DRS ? In general we shall say that a DRS is pair consisting of a  ( possibly empty ) domain of di-scourse referents U and a set of conditions CON  . We shall for the present discussion take into consideration only three types of conditions : a  ) atc~nic conditions , which consists of nary predicate P and terms . 
a term is either a discourse referent or a proper name  ; among the predicates we single out the eqdality predicate "="  . 
b ) conditional conditions which have the form = > ( kl , k2) where kl and K2 are again DRSs . 
c ) negative conditinal conditions which has the form  #>  ( Kl , k2) . 
In a more comprehensive treahnent Jt is clear that we shall need further types of conditions  . 
Thus for the final translations of unresolved translation we want to arrive at DRSs like the following :  ( a ) 
BergLoulouc ~ npose(Berg , Loulou ) ( b)--i--f . . . . . . . . . 
composer(x ) opera(y ) com~x\]se(x , y )__> recerd(x , y ) There are precise truth definitions for DRSs which we shall not s\[~ll outhere however  ( cf KAMP for details )  . In any case the first DRS is logically equivalent to the formula : compose  ( berg , loulou ) and the second DRS is logically equivalent to the predicat logic formula ~: chaque  ( x , (cha~ue(y , ( cc ~ poser(x ) & opera(y ) & compose(x , y )) -> record(x , y ) ) ) What is interesting in the second example is of course a fact that the pronoun " it " has as its syntactic antecedent the noun phrase " an opera  "  . These ~ qntic force of this noun phrase cannot however be rendered in terms of an existential quantifier at \]  . east not if we want to establish an ~ maphoric\] in k between the existential quantifier and the variable representing the pronoun in the consequent of the conditional  . 
MO~I~AGUE for instance runs into this problen in Vi ~ where the pronoun is either left unbound or either is bound by the existential quantifier when the latter occur outsi ~ the conditional all together  . This wide scope reading of the indefinite NP obviously gives them the wr  ( mg interpretation . As does of course the translation leaving the pronoun unbound  . In the DRS on the other hand we get a universal reading for an opera as the result of the interpretation of the conditio-nal  . 
Even though inside the antecedent of the conditional we treat the occurrence of the indefinite noun phrase " an opera " as we would in an ordinary indicative sentence  , where of course ~ leinter pretation of the indefinite article corresponds more naturally to an existential quantifier  . This is one of the features of IQNMP theory that we shallt m kead vantages of in the present proposal  . 
As we said above we shall transform unresolved translations stepwise into DRSs  . Needless to say we could of coucse setup the translation procedure in such a way that we obtain DRSs directly from the output of the syntactic component  . But this would entail major revision of the entire translation algorithn in any event the way we propose to derive DRSs can here garded as DRS construction algorithm in its own right  . On this view " our unre~uced translations " play the role of an intermediate structure between syntax and DRS so Assume that t is an unresolved ~ : anslation of a sentence  . We first generate K ( t ) the discourse representation structure corres ~ : mding to t  , in the following way : if t is a univemsal tree i . ea formula of the fon ~ chaque---x--fl--- f2 we create a DRSK ( t ) with an empty donmin and the condition => ( KI , K2 ) o K1 will have x in hisd~nain and the result of transforming fl in  K1 as its condition K2 will have an emptyd ~ min and the result of tran- : Forming:  f2 as its c ~ onditions . 
Let t be a tree with the determiner " aucun " as its top node  , i . ea formula of the form : aucun---x---fl . . . .  f2 we procede as in the case above except that the condition we emter into K  ( t ) is now a negative universal condition , i . ea condition of the form => ( kl , K2) . 
Suppose tisd all inated by exist i . et has the form : exist . . . . x . . . . fl we create a DRS K ( t ) whose domain contains x and we add the result of trauls forming flas the conditions to 

Suppose t is a treed c ~ inated by " et " of the form : et---fl---  f2 i . ea formula we create a DRSK ( t ) with an empty domain whose conditions are the result of transforming fl and  f2 with respect to K ( t )  . 
Finaly suppose the unresolved translation is non quantifie ~\] then we enteritasis into K and we add all occurrences of proper names into the domain of K  . 
This provides the induction basis for the tranforma-tion  . Let K'k ~ a DRS with dc~minU ' and conditions CON ' and let the atreei  . ea formula . The result of transforming t in K ' is the application of the above three rules to t  . When we no longer have any tree to process all conditions in the principle Ki  . e the DRS representing the sentence to be transformed  , as well now be conditions in the language of DRSs or atomic conditions containing occurrences of pronouns  . 
How are these be eliminated ?
Let us first consider an example the sentence " every composer dedicated an operato a conductor that he has admired " has as its unresolved translation : chaqui---xfl:---ccmposer  ( x ) I f2: - - - exist---exist---zI--- conducter  ( z ) & opera ( y ) & dedicate ( x , y , z ) & admire(he , z ) We indicate the contruction of the DRS stepwise
K 1 ( i ) x composer(x )
K2 (2)
K1x composer(x--->
K2yz opera(y ) conductor(z ) dedicate(x , y , z ) admire(x , z ) (3) 3 . 2 INCORPORATING DRS CONSTRAINTS INTO TRANSLATIONS ? o " We will give below the exact method for translating formulas of OPERA into DRSs  . 
One of the most important features of DR-theory is the precise constraints on the antecedents of pronouns  . 
Let K ' be a DRS embedded in K ( which is a DRS too )  ; the antecedent of a pronoun occurring in K ' is the list consisting of the union of U  ( K ) and U ( K ' ) if and only if K is accessible to K ' . 
For a precise definition of the notion of accessibili-tycf\[GUENTHNER&I~HMAN  , 85\] . 
Let us now illustrate the notion of accessibility by giving the table of accessibility of the DRS above : ~ DRS accessible IK 
K 1 ( I )
By the transitive closhre of the accessibility relation we obtain for example all the possible antecedents of a pronoun occurring in  K2   ( e . ga pronoun occurring in K1 cannot have as antecedent a referent of K2  )  . 
For the clarity of what will follow , we will call " unresolved predicate " ( abreviated UP ) a predicate whose arguments included at least one pronoun  . Then to resolve an UP , one must replace the pronoun arguments with appropriate referents accessible  . 
The idea is to transport during the translation of formulas  , a list of antecedents accessible according to DRSs constraints ? 
How is this list to be constructed ?
As shown in (3 . 1 ) a universal tree is translated into a DRSK ==> ( KI , K2) ; the antecedent list of K which we note L ( K ) is 6npty . 
The antecedent list of K\] is L ( K1 ) and L ( K2 ) = U2 + L ( K1 )   ( we denote the union of sets by the symbol + )  . 
The existential tree is translated into K =\[ U , CON\] and the antecedent list L(K ) = U . 
Let f be a formula with " aucun " at its top node ; f is translated into the DRSK ~> ( KI , K2) . The list of antecedents L ( K ) of K is empty and L ( KI ) is U1 and L ( K2 ) = U2 + L ( KI )  . 
Let us call a DRS containing " unresolved predicates " an " unresolved DRS "  . Thus each unresloved DRS is a pair of the form K =\[ K  , L ( K ) \] where L ( K ) is the antecedent list of the DRSK . 
To resolve an unresolved DRS , each unresolved predica-te ( UP ) must be resolved according to the following mule : for an unresolved DRSK =\ [ K  , L(K)\]with K =\[ U , CON\]a UPP of CON is transformed into the logical predicate P " which is obtained by unifying pronoun arguments of 
PihL(K).
? The example " every composer dedicated an opera to a conducter that he has admired " treated in session  3  . 1 will illustrate how unresolved DRSs are resolved . 
Given the unresolved DRSK = \[ K , nil \] with K = A > ( kl , k2) , KI=\[Kl , x \] , K 1 = ( x , ccrnposer ( x ) ) and opera ( y ) & conducter ( z ) & dedicate ( x , y , z ) & admire(x , he ) K will here solved by application of the rule descri-bed above  , i . e : The pronoun heis\[mifiable in the list(x , y ) of antecedents , to z . Therefore the unresolved predicate will be translated into a ~ idre  ( x , z) . 
4- EX'I~NDING THE DIALOGUE CAPACITY OF OPERA A proble ~ arises in interrogating a database in natu-ra\]  . language which is the problem of dialogue situation  . For example: ( a ) quiac~t ~ posdLoulou ( who composed\[mulou ? )   ( b ) ohest-iln 4? ( where is heborn ? ) This dialogue can he translated into a DRS containing the semantic representation of the two sentences  . But if there is no interaction with the data base  , the anaphoric link of the pronoun in ( b ) will be a nun-bound variable and not for example the individual " Berg "  ( as Jt is Bergwhoc~nposed Loulou )  . 
What we prefer for a question-answering system is to take into account the situation of a question and its answer  . 
A possible solution could be . to consider that after the eval\[mtion of a query  , its c~r responding DRS is therefore instantiated ( i . e . its unbound variables are now bound ) ; in such a situation we loose the reading of the DRS as a logical formula and moreover we cannot represent the instantiation of a splitted DRS  ( e . g . a universal formula ) . 
4 ?1 q~ENCZI'ION OFA"CURRENTSITUATION DRS " The solution we proposed is to separate the DRS of a formula from the DRS for the situation  . 
Let t be a formula and K(t ) : \[ U , CON\]its translation into a DRS . 
The DRS of situation is the ORSK?(n ) =\[ U ? , CON?\]with U ? containing the instantiation of referents of 

CON?(~pty , and n denoting the current state of the dialogue ( i . e . the occurrence of the question during the dialogue  )  . 
The rule for UP resolution presented in the last session  , must now be modified in the following way : let n be the current state of the dialogue and K be an unresol ~<\] DRS  ; the antecedent of a pronoun occurring in K is contain el in the list consisting of the concatenati  ( xl of L ( K ) and L ( K? ( n-I ) ) . 
The antecedent list of K ? ( i ) is defined in the same way as that a nor aml O~5 , i . e . L(K?(i )) = U?(i) . 
To illustrate what is a bever we will treat the dialogue above:  ( a ) is translated into the logical formulatl = Wh ( x , c~\]npose(x , Loulou )); its translation into a
DRS will produce K1.
K 1?x Imulou compose(x , Loulou)
Since there is no prono < ~ n in KI , we can then evaluate the formulatl . After evaluation , we can build the
DRS of situation K ?:

Berg Loulou ( b ) will be tranlated into the logical formula t2 = Wh ( y , bern(\[he , mas , sing\] , y )) The unresolved DRS of t2 is K2 =\ [ K2 . .L(K2)\] with
K2\[he , mas , sing\]y bern(he , y ) and L(K ) = y + L(K ? (2-1)) = \[ y , Berg , Loulou\] . 
To resolve K2 , an antecedent must be substituted to " he " ; this antecedent will be Berg ( because argtunents in OPFJ tA are typed )  . 
The DP , S of situation becomes:

Berg Vienne 4 . 2 TREAI\[MENT OF ELJ~IPSIS One of the most con~aon \] phenomena of dialogue is ellipsis such as in :   ( a ) Bergac ~ pos 6loulou
Bergca ~ I posed Loulou ( b ) Brittenaussi
Brittentoor ( c ) etm % esym phonie and a symphony The interpretation of  ( b ) is " Britten acQuposdLoulou " ( i . e . VP-ellipsis ) ; and ( c ) is to be interpre-ted as " Berga compos6 tmesymphonie " . 
The adhoc treatment proposed in \[ SEDOGBO , 85\] fails in 1lmny cases ; as we mentioned , since the logical formulas in OPERA are equivalent to first-order logic formulas  . 
An interesting extension to VP-ellipsis in DR -theory is described by KLEIN  ( cf\[KLEIN84\] ) ? KLEIN introduced the notion of predicate-DRS and pro-predicate-DRS in a DRS  . 
We will not propose here how this extended DRS can be implemented  ; but will exploit the parallelism between our logical formulas and DRSs  . 
Each sentence will be translated into two partial -logical formulas  ( noted PLF ) of the form < x , f > , where x is a variable or an individual and fa logical formula  . 
We assume that the composition of PLF ( NP ) and PLF ( VP ) gives the translation of the sentence . 
The first PLF is implicitly indexed by the NP and the second PLF is indexed by the VP  . 
The DRS of current situation must be modified in the following way : K ?  ( n ) =\[ U ? , CON?\] with U ? defined as above , and CON ? contain ig PLF ( VP ) . 
Given a VP-ellipsiss , it will be translated into the the PLF : < i , f l > . The DRS of current situation contains in its CON ? a PLF : < j  , f2> . 
The VP-ellipsis is treated in the following way : i  ) ~lification of i and j2 ) the c~upositi ~ of < i , fl > and < j , f2 > produces the translation t3 ) t is translated into a DRSK and K ? is built as described in session  ( 4 . 1 ) We will illustrate the VP-ellipsis treatment by processing the dialogue above :  ( a ) is translated into the formula compose ( Berg , Loulou ) and PLF ( NP ) = < Berg , Berg> , 
PLF(VP ) = < i , cempose(i , Loulou ) > .
The translation t of ( a ) is then obtained by ccraposi-tion of PLF ( NP ) and PLF ( VP )  ; thus t : compose ( Berg , loulou) . 
The evaluation of twill augment the dialogue situation of a new DRS of situation containing PLF  ( VP )  . 
The translation of ( b ) will produce a PLF ( NP ) = < Britten , Britten > and a PLF(VP ) = < i , p> . 
<i , p > will then be unified to the PLF ( VP ) contained in the CON ? of K ? , i . e < i , p > is unified with < i , ccmpose(i , Loulou ) > ; the composition of the two PLF < Britten , Britten > , < Britten , canpose(Britten , Loulou ) > will produce the logical formula " ccmpose ( Britten , Loulou)" . 
5-CONCLUSION
The extensions to the OPERA system proposed here give a powerful dialogue capacities to OPERA  . 
On the basis of the DR-theory , we propose an extension for the treatment of anaphora  . We do not treat here the definite article as a definite refence since in our system the definite article must be interpreted as an indefinite article  . However notice that even if in the framework of DR-theory the definite article is explained as a definite anaphora  , its anaphoric link requires often the use of deduction  . We prefer therefore not to treat the definite anaphora  . 

The extension to ellipsis described in this paper is limited to VP-ellipsis  ; in fact the other \] dnds of el-liptic sentences can be seen as conjoined to the preceding sentences  . Even if the treatment proposed is not the one described by KLEIN  , the notion of partial logic formula is equivalent to that of partial-DRS  . 
In order to handle the dialogue we introduce the notion of a current situation DRS  . 
But , is the level of logic translations ( i . eour logical formulas ) necessary , since we translate these for-mu\]ms into DRSs ? The reason to maintain this intermediate representation is that our use of DRSs is only justified by the accounting of the dialogue  , so that we do not need the complex features of a DRS system  . Then for reason of efficiency we think that it is better to evaluate translations on the data base  ( this enables the t~e of an optimization algorithm before executing the queries  )  .
