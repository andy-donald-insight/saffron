1. Introduction
In this paper we introduce a system For the semi -automatic enlargement of a morphological lexicon  . 
\]7 t forms part of VIE-I , ANG , a Geru ~ an language dialogue system ( Buchbetgor et al .  1982) . ViE-hANG serves not only as a noh ) oct but a same ta system as we\]\]: its knowledge has  . ; is to been \] argnd , and its\[acJ\]\[Lies are used to support that process : the parser serves to anal  . yzetile input to the acqu\]s\]t \] on system , the generator \] s used to provide examples . 
IZn contrast LoEnglish the morphological analysis of German words is no trivia \] task  , due to two causes :-\]" Jrst: , there is a rich\]nl\]ectiona \] system , connJsting of about 60 d~\[ferentendings ( where most endings have various different interpretations  )  , some prefixes (' re-'\[or PPP , ' zu ' Coy some infinitive forms ) , ' umlautung ' , and Jrregu \] . arTerms , -second , \] emma\]Jzation has to be complemented by interpretation  , because the functional structure of a sentence Js not bound to constituent order but to the case system  ( expressed by inflection ) instead . 
To build up a lexicon , one needs a classification of ( ; erman words on the basis of their graphemic real ization  . There exist several works on \] his sub~ect , e . g . Bergmann (1982) , Knopik (1984) , Schott (\]978) , Schu\]ze and Heinze (1982) , WJ\]lee (1979) . For VIE-LANG we developed our own classific at ion scheme  ( T ~ ost and D off \] nor 1986 )  , based on Kunze and Ruediger (1968) . 
For all those scheme RJ t takes an expert to classify new words correctly  . Our acquisition system contains \]\] ngulst ic expertise in the for nl of different typos of rules  , which allows for semi-automatic acquis ( tJon of \] exica \] knowledge in an interaction with a user who need not have spec\]f Jci ingu\]sticknowledge  . 
Whereas different approaches for knowledge acquisition for N\]  , U systems have been proposed ( e . g . Ba\]lard (1984) , Haas and HendrJx (1982)) , we concentrate on the acquisition o C\[exical data/\[or the German language by using specif icproperties of this domain  . 
2 . The Morphologic Classification Scheme Out : classification schem  (  ; is based primarily on the setsel suffixes that call be attached to certain stems  . 
Every different set : constitutes a morphological class  , and every lexicon entry Calls exactly into one of these classes  . AL together there are about 70 different ones . 
For each class two lists are stored : One contaJn L ng the set of suffixes belonging to the class  , and another one containing the syntactic interpretation for each oF these suffixes  . Super\]reposed on this scheme is information about ' umlaut ' and prefix ' ge '  . r Pheyocculto i i \] y J n a few positions , depending on the word cat_egory .  \] ) : very poss Jb\]e comb\]nation\]s represented by a col:tain hUmOr  ( call vn Iuo store da\]ong with each \] oxJ conentry  . 
We dist \] rlgnish between morpho\]ogic and syntactic Jnfornlation  , the latter being a CeatLlrOe\[the\]exeme itself  ( and not expressed by inflection )  . Mnrphologic information consists of the Fol lowing features :

3873. Knowledge Base
The acquisition system is rule based . Its knowledge base comprises three types of rules :-Rules representing inflectional paradigms  . These rules describe the basic types of conjugation and declination in German  . 
-Morphonological rules . The basic inflection alendings are split up into a much larger set by various morphonological rules which alter the endings and stems to make pronunciation easier  . 
-Heuristic rules . While the former two rule types are derived from the German grammar proper  , these rules are like plausible guesses . They guide the system to make choices like which category a word belongs to according to knowledge about forms  ( i . e . all verbs end with-en ) , actual frequency of classes , etc . 
These rules are organized in distinct packages . Only rules in active packages are considered . Rules may activate and deactivate rule packages . 
4. Overall Architecture
According to their different nature , the three mentioned types of rules are processed differently  . 
Knowledge about inflectional types serves to partition the words into disjunct classes  . Once the inflectional type has been determined , there are relatively clear guidelines as to the inflection of the word  . The inflectional type actually is a subclassification of the word type  . 
One of the crucial points is determining the word type  . 
The system first tries to make use of its basic vocabulary  . It checks whether a new word is composed of words already in the lexicon or of an existing word stem together with a derivation alending  . There is a rule in German morphology stating that in compound words the morphological class is determined by the last word  . On a similar line reasoning about derivational endings is performed  , as those may determine word type as well as inflection  . As a next heuristic morphological clues are taken into consideration  . 
There exist a number of them , but ambiguities may arise . If this is the case , a third strategy is applied : the system asks the user to type in a short utterance containing the new word  . The utterance is analysed by the parser of VIE -LANG rendering information about the word type by means of the phrase type it appears in  . In applying this method , the system relies on a simple but important presupposition : the user usually enters an utterance containing the word in a proper linguistic context facilitating determination of its type  . We do not argue that the user will always utter the minimal projection  , but that he will not violate phraseborders with his utterance  . 
The knowledge about phrase types as well as the basic vocabulary permits unambiguous determination of the word type in most cases  , especially as the most irregular forms that are very limited in number  ( words of the closed word classes : pronouns , articles , auxiliary and modal verbs , etc . ) have already been included in the basic lexicon . 
Once the word type has been determined , the rule package associated with it is activated . Let's suppose the new word is a verb . Then , the verb-package is triggered . Here in turn we find packages for strong and weak inflection  . The large number of subclasses is implied by morphonological reasons  , whereby the small number of general paradigms is multiplied  . 
Morphonologic rules have exact matching conditions  , therefore classification in this part is automated to a strong inflection first  . As exact rules do not exist , heuristics are applied which are based mainly on word frequency  . 
An important feature is the dynamic interaction register : the hypotheses evoked by the heuristic rules require to be confirmed by the user  . The system knows which wordforms will form sufficient evidence for a certain hypothesis  . It will generate these forms and ask the user for confirmation  . The forms however depend on the hypotheses . Thus , the user is only asked a minimum of questions . The forms to be asked for a rekept in a dynamic interaction register which is updated with every hypothesis and every answer from the user  . 
5. An Example Session
In this chapter we show how a new entry is actually created  . The user starts the interaction by entering a new word  , e . g . ' abgeben ' ( to leave ) . The first thing the system has to do is to decide about the word category  . To find out if it is a compound word it will try to split off words first from the beginning then from the end  . 
This will result in recognizing ' ab ' as a separable verb adjunct  . Of course the ' ab ' could be part of a totally different stem like ' Abend '  ( evening ) or ' abet ' ( but )  . So the system looks for facts supporting the verb hypothesis  . Verbs are usually typed in in infinitive form and this implies the ending'-en'  ( in a few cases also '- n ' )  . Of course this '- en ' could also be part of a stem like ' Magen '  ( stomach ) or ' wegen ' ( because )  , but the combination of both verb adjunct ' ab ' and ending'-en'on a word belonging to a different category is highly unp\]ausible  . So'abgeben ' is split into ab/geb/en . 
As a next step the lexicon is looked up for ' geb  '  . If it is found the rest is easy . All the information from ' geb ' is simply duplicated  ; the only additional information to be stored is about these parable ' ab '  . 
This way the new entry may be created without any other help by the user  . 
To continue with our example we will assume that ' geb ' is not already contained in the lexicon  . That means the system has to figure out a hypothesis concerning the conjugation type of ' abgeben '  ( either weak or strong )  . Since weak verbs make up the vast majority of German verbs  , this hypothesis is tried first . 
FOR MCLASS FMUM PFSY present tense abgeb 44   0   0 I 502 Weak conjugation is regular , all forms are built from one stem . To confirm weak conjugation it suffices to show the user the Ist persons g past tense  . Before doing so all morphonological rules connected to weak conjugation are tried  . None applies , so user interaction can start . Ist persons g of past tense in the weak paradigm is ' gebteab '  . To make sure the user knows which form is intended  , some context has to be provided . This leads to the phrase ' gestern gebtei chab '   ( I leaved yesterday ) specifying tense and person . 
The user recognizes ' gebte ' as incorrect and rejects that phrase  . This makes the system discard the hypothesis weak and try strong instead  . 
Strong conjugation is more complicated than weak.
There may be a maximum of four different stems for present tense  , present tense 2nd and 3rd persons g , past tense and PPP . All these possibilities have either to be resolved automatically or asked explicitly from the user  . First the system continues to determine the past tense forms  . There are three different types of vowel changes in the case of ' e'-stems  ( e-a-e , e-o-o , e-a-o ) . They are sorted by frequency , because no other criterion is available . Again all morphonological rules applicab \] e to strong verbs are tried  . In our case none applies , so the user is asked again for verification with ' gestern gabic hab '  ( I left yesterday )  . 
FOR MCLASS present tenseabge b 30 pres . t . 2nd p . sg past tense abgab 23 past participle
FMUM PFSY
This time the user confirms , so the system can go on . 
There are two possibilities for the PPP , and again the more frequent one is tried , and accepted by the user . 
There is still another irregularity concerning  2nd and 3rd persons g present tense , in most of the cases the stem vowel ' e ' becomes ' i '  . After verification of this fact the morphological class is finally determined  . 
The system creates three lexical entries ' abgeb ' , ' abgib ' and ' abgab ' for present and PPP ,   2nd and 3rd persons g present tense and past tense respectively  . 
Now all of the features have to be filled in . PF of ' abgeb ' is set to I , since the verb adjunct ' ab ' implies the use of the prefix ' ge -' for the PPP  . UM is set to 8 for ' abgab ' , indicating ' umlautung ' for the subjunctive mode in the Dast tense  . FM ofth ~ primary entry ' abgeb ' is set to 8 as a resu\]t of the combination of classes . Then SY is set to 502 (5= verb , 0 = present perfect with ' haben ' , 2: separable verb adjunct of length 2) . 
FOR MCLASS FMUM PFSY present tense abgeb 22   8   0 I 502 pres . t . 2nd p . sgabgib 26   0   0 past tense abgab 23   8   0 Next all indicative forms of present and past tense and the PPP are printed and the user is asked for confirmation  . This step could actually be skipped but it is another safety measure against faulty entries  . 
In our specific example there is a final step to be done : Since ' geb'was not found in the lexicon  , it has to be included , too , for two reasons . First the analysis algorithm otherwise could not handle all those cases where the particle is actually split off in the text  , second there may be more compound verbs with ' geb '  , and their incorporation into the lexicon can then be handled fully automatic  . Since the verb stem of a compound verb with separable verb adjunct can always appear as a verb in its own right  , this poses no problem . The situation is slightly more difficult with other particles where this is not granted  . In those cases the new entry must be marked as internal  , so that it does not affect analysis or synthesis . 
Creation of the new entries is simple anyway . All forms are duplicated , ' abgeb ' , ' abgib ' and ' abgab ' are changed to ' geb ' , ' gib ' , ' gab'respectively and SY is set to 500 instead of 502  . 
6. Conclusion
We have presented as ys Lemwhich automates acquis ition of lexical data for a natural language understanding system to a large extent  . Knowledge acquisition takes place in graceful interaction with a human who is not supposed to have specific linguistic knowledge  . The system relies on the existing natural language system VIE-LANG containing among other sources of knowledge a lexicon with a basic vocabulary such that acquisition does not start from scratch but can be seen as an iterative process  . The acquisition system is based on a small rule based system in which three different sorts of knowledge-inflections \]  , morphonological and heuristic are dist inguished and processed differently  . As for der\[vational endings as well as compound words the system heavily relies on existing lexicon entries to form its hypotheses  . 
The described system forms part of an integrated system for the acquisition of different sorts of knowledge for natural language understanding  . An outline of the overall system is to be found in Trost and Buchberger  ( \]985 )  . The final goal will be a system which augments its knowledge automatically in every interaction with the user in a practical and comfortable way  .
