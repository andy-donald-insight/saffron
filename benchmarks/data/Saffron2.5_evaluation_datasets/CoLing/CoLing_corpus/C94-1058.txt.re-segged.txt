Abstract Natural language generation must work with insufficient input  . Underspecifications can be caused by shortcomings of the component providing the input or by the prelhninary stal  . e of incrementally given input . The paper Mms to escape from such dead-end situations by making ~ ussumptions  . We discuss global aspects of default handling . Two i ~ roblem classes for defaults in the increment M syntactic gener  ; ttor VM-GEN are presented to substantiate our discussion  . 
1 MOTIVATION
Natural Language Generation , i . e . , the process of building an adequate utterance for some given content  , is by nature a decision making problem ( Appelt ,  1985) . Interna . 1 decisions are made on the basis of the specified input  . Unfortunately , input information can be insufficient in two respects : ? If the input structure for generation is provided by another AI-system  ,   . qloba . l problems in producing svJ . Jicicn linp't , tiu J ' or m . a . tio ~, for the generator may occur , e . g . , because o \[' translation mismatches in inachine translation  ( Kameyama ,  19!)1) . In this case , the generatore it l , er has to use a default or formulat . e a request for clarification in order to be abh ~ to continue its processing  , i . e . , to produce an utterance . During simultaneous interpret a . -tion requests are rather unusual . Ilere defaults allow for a sta . nd alone handling of t : he problem . For example , problems during speech recognition of automatic interprel : a-tion can lead to results like  , " the ( man/men ) will come to the hotel tomorrow " . If the system is not able to give a preference for one of the alternatives  , e . g . , by evaluating context information , the generator has to choose " The author is eurrent  , lyat NTT Network lurermation Systems Laboratories  ( kikui ( (Nlttnly . ntt . .i P ) a probable number value on its own to complete verbalization  . 
? Furthermore , for incremental generation , the input information is produced and hand-e . down'step by step , so that it can be tem-poraril 9 in eomplele--although as a whole it may become sufficient  . This behaviour of a generator is motiw , ted by psycholinguistic ob-serva . tions which show that people ~ start speak-lug1 ) e\[bre all necessary linguistic material has been chosen  ( e . g . , articulating a noun phrase be\['ore , the dominating w' . rb is selected ) . As a consequence of undersl)ecification , icremen-talgeneration is essentially based on working with defaults  , l'~lements are uttered before the processing or input consuml % ion has been finished  . ( Kita . no ,  1990 ) gives an example for defaults in i : he context of simultaneous interpretation : In Japanese  , negation is specified at the end of the sentence while in English  , it has to be specified ill\['rent of the finite verb  . 
Tllere\[bre , during . lapanese-English translation , where analysis , l ; ransfer , and general ; i on a rel ) erformed in a para . llel and incremental way , the system has to commit , e . g . , positive wdm ' , l~el ' or e knowing the actual polarlty I . 
Generally spea . kiug , dcfa . ' ullh . and lin , gspeci-ties how processing , i . e . , furthe , ' decision-mak-ing , can contimu , witl ~ outsufficient input information .

In this case , the output has to be repaired , e . g . , by repeating parts of the ut > terance : " I will be able to meet you  . .  . oops .   .   . I wo n't ; be able to meet you at the hotel this evening . " In the tbllowing sections , we argue Ibrl . he appropriateness of process in q-conformi ~ ttj default handling  . Basically , tlte processing-con-forming mode makes the overall system ho-mogenem zs because the combination of default-caused processing and input-licensed processing requires no specific description  .

The content of this paper can he summarized as follows  . Section 2 provides a geucral description for defaults i u generation emphasizing the specific requirements in an incremental system  . After identifying the conditions under which defaults are triggered  ( set > tion 2 . 1), the application of a default ( set > tion 2 . 2 ) and the delh fition of its descrill tioll ( section 2 . 3) is outlined .

2 GENERAL DISCUSSION OF

In the literature of norl-incremental generation , the need for defaults is hardly ever taken into account  . The conunon point of view restricts theiulmt to be sulIicient for generation  ( see , e . g . , the Te:ct Slructure by ( Meteer , 1990) for a syntactic generator ) . In increment algm , eration , most authors agree on the necessity of using defaults  ( see , e . g . , ( l)eSmedt , 1990; Kitano , 1990; Ward , 1991)) . Nevertheless , they do not insufficient depth answer the question of how to guide the processes of default handling an  ( l repair wil ; h in a generator . This I ~ roblem is the starting -- point tbr the following considerations  . 
We assume tlm . t generation is a decision--making process witll the aimo\['producing itphmsiMeul:t  ( wance 1 ) ased on given information . As mentioned in section 1 , there are cases where this I ) rocess stops ( caused by un-derspccifical . ioll of the input ) before finishing its output . 
We define a module named d@tv . l ! han-dh : r which tries to resume the process by giving advice to il  ;  , i . e . , by maldng assumptions about tile missing input specification  . With respect to this task it is discussed 1 . in whicll situations de . faults are applied ( see section 2 . 1 ), 2 . how default handling is integrated into as b , st : cm ( see sectiou 2 . 2), 3 . I low 1 . he know h'dg:eforde\['aulthandling is ~ h ! scrihed  ( see . s < ' ctioll2 . 3), and d . how assumptious arc cancelled when they I . urll out 1 . o Im inconsistent wil , \] , newly arriving input ; ( see section 2 . 4) . 
hi incremental generation , as mentioned in section 1 , interleaved input consumption and OUtlml . l ) rodll cl . ioncauses spc'cific default situations . An incremental processing scheme allows for an increase of elficiency and flexibility  , e . g . , by making tlm analysis and gen-eral . ionl ~ rocesses of a system\['or simultane , -ous interl ~ ret , al : io now ~ rlap in Lime . There are two CO mlml . ing goals of incremental genera-i ; i(m for spoken oul , imt , thai , mnsl ; betal , : en of defaults : Fluency : Longhesitations hould be a  . void-ed during the production of an utl ; erance , in order to be aecept alde to the hearer 2 . 
Reliabillty : Errors in an utterance may cause misunderstanding  . In most cases , errors should be recovered by appropriate self -corrections a  . Excessive use of self-correc-tions or erroneous expressions should be avoided because they decrease in td ligibil-ity of the utterance  . 
Obviously there is a tradeoff between fluency and reliability : maximal reliability requires ' secure ' decisions and the retbre leads to output delay  . On the other hand , maximal fluency necessitates the use of assuml ) tions and repair , respectively . 
2 . 1 When to T r igger Defau l t Hand l ing We define as de  . fa . ~ d tsit'ltatio ~ z the situation where a generation system has not yet finished the utterance but at the same t  ; ime has consumed all given iul ) ut and is not a hletocontinue processing . In nonincrement algel > eration , this corresponds to the fact that the input lacks necessary informatiou  , because the entire input is assumed to be given at one time  ( e . g . , the undecidable number wdue of the example described in section  1   )  . Thus , default handling should be triggered in uned i -ately  . 
In incremental generation , however , tile system may gel ; a new piece of infBrmation lai:er on that enables it to continue processing  ( e . g . , the specification of a negation wdue + as outlined in the example in section  1  )  . Tllere-for e , possible alternatives are either to wait for the next in pntor to trigger default handling  . The former violates the fluency goal , the latter may violate the reliability goal . We propose the explicit use of time-limits . lot delay intervals 4 . 
= Ilumans often fill such pauses with filler . slike % r " or " what shall Isay " . 
a Sometimes , correct , ionism meeessary il ' ( I . hespeaker believes that ) the heare rean in l > rt . he intended utterance from errol ~ eous speech . 
4An explicit parameter xpressing tile desired e -gree of fluency influences the time--limit  . s . 
Furthermore , the certainty of a & fault is described by a value  . As so on a Madefault situation is identified , the certainty of the default is checked to see whether it exceeds a predefined threshold that : determines the degree of fluency/relia  . bilityr ' . 
l' . ;ach application o1" a default decreases the global certainty o\[' the system'state  . Consequently , there should be a limit J br them nzi-real n ' ~ , mbcr of dc foults apl ) licable to the same sentence . 
2 . 2 How to In tegrate Defau l t Hand l ing Basically  , there are two strategies to integrate default handling into ongoing processing  . 
\] ) ef anlts may be handled in a way that dif-\[>rs from the ' normal ' processing of the system  , e . g . , as shortcuts . One . advantage can be an eflicient haudling o\[' defaults  , l Vurther-more , the . designm'o\['the de\['a . ult component is completely free in decidiug about the realization of defaults in the system  . A dis-adwm tage is the di\[\[icull ; y of providing consistency between del ' aull ; -caused and input-lice used process hlg . 
Alternal : iw ~ ly , l : l ~ e ongoing processing can deal with the de ( ' aull : values in a . nordinary manner ( processing conlbrming default handling )  . This may heless efficient but guaran_-tees consistency during processing  , especially in case of a replacement by an input -licensed w due  . got incremental generation , tile system has to provide repair fa . cilil ; ies in any case . 
So , they can also be used\['ornmt-monoloT/cn lodi\ [ical  , iOllS ~\[" d~q ' aull , caused results . We lake this opl ; iou in order to make the own ' all system \] J . (~mogc,~co'tzs . 
2. a How to Describe Defaults
The knowledge source that is used for defaulg handling should provide the most plausible actions\[Bradei ' ault:situation  . We represenl ; the Iwlowledge as a sel:o\['heuristic rules called dq/'a'tdldc  . ~'("~'ip/io~ . s .

3 58 out in a certain situation where the generation process cannot be continued  . A def ' ault description has the following form :\ [ default defaulteerl < ti '  , zt . y\]preconditions ~ body ; val, . c The set of defaull prceondilions defines tests that are applied to the given situal ` ion in order to find out whether the corresponding default body can be a cl  , ival , ed . They include tests for the existence of parl , icular information , tests for the strucl`ure und c'r creation and tests for the sl  , ate of processing . 
The default body describes how to continue 1 ) rocessing with de\['aull`s in an adequat . eway . For incremenl ` al systems , we propose to express the body as a specification of input increments  . An impotl , anl , prerequisil : e is that the size of inct'ements i defin  ( ~ d\[h'xi-bly enough to cope With varying amount ; so \[" information .

So , we end up with a processing-conform-ing default handler for generation realizing repair by nonmonotonic hanges  . 
3 EXAMPLES OF DEF AULTS
INVM-GEN
The adaptation of our general discussion of default handling to the system VM-CEN not only provides concret examples for the reader but also shows that a homogeneous combination of default handling  , regula . r processing , and utterance repair is possible . 
The syntactic generator VM-GI'~N is a further development of TAG-GEN  ( Kilger , 19!)4) within the fi-amework of VERBMOBIL , a speech-to-speech translation system . Its usefulness for simultaneous interpretation results from its incremental and pa'rallel style of processing  . VM-GEN is able to consume input increinents of varying size  . q ' hese , increments describe lexical items or semantic relations between them  . Single input increments are handed over to objects of a distril  ) uted parallel system , each of which tries to verbalize the structure that results from the corresponding input increment  . VM-O , \]'~ N uses ml extension of Tree Adjoining Gra'm ' mct'rs  ( TACs , c\[' .

In the following , we iul ; roduce xaml ) h :' s for default processing triggered during the ( ler-man inflection process in VM-GI'2N to suh-stantiate tile global statements made in sec ~ Lion  2  . Inflection uses some synta . cLic properties of an element o compute its morphological form  . This information has partly t : obespecified in the input  ( e . g . , the numl ) er for a noun ) and is partly inherited fi'o mother el-rlf some phrases inllue need by defaull  . shave already been verbalized , the eft'eel ; of verl ~ aliza Lion can be cancelled by using repair words like " oops " or " solry " when starting t  , he modified utt . erance . 
ements ( e . g . , tile number for a verb or tile case for a noun ) . The two reasons for missing information ecessitate different methods of treatment which nevertheless both can uniformly be integrated into regular processing  . 
If information of the first type is missing ( e . g . , because of problems during analysis , see section 1) , an assuml ~ tion can be made locally by simulating the respective part of the input  . 
The default for missing number information in VM -CIBN would look as follows :\[  ( e * . I(OBJ ,= N )( I ; , ' NTITY OB . I \]( . . . . . . . ber(OBd ) = NIL ) => (' au ', , dm , ' sg )); 0 . 8  8 The set of default preconditions is applied to all ' j objects  ( OB . 1 ) of VM-GEN in order to Lest the kind of underspecification  ( ' number ' in the example )  . The default body introduces a new value ( sg ) by creating an input increment as a . default . The test for coincidence with the input-licensed value is realized by a comparison in the objects of VM-CEN  . 
There is a . uuique association of input increments and objocts of VM-  ( ~ EN ( OBJ is used as identifier ) l : hat allows for translating an input mo ( lifica . l : ion into a . modification of the state of the respective object  . In ease of contradictions the dofa . ult and all default-caused decisions are revised m  ( see below )  .

4 DISCUSSION
This l ) al ) erprolms es a . processiug conform h~g default : hau ( ller for geueration realizing repair hy non monotouh " changes  . We provide the system with def ' ault descriptions . The set of default preconditions expresses possil ) lerea ~ triggered , if the preconditions match the cu > rent situation and the certainty value of the default exceeds the i  ) redefined threshold . The default body is expressed in terms of the missing input specification in order to make the system work homogeneously  . We have verified the advantages of processing -conforming default handling by implementing a default handler for VM-GEN  . 
As future work , we will extend the default preconditions towards handling complex contextual information  . We will apply default handling to microplanning and lexical choice within VERBMOBIL  . With respect to a sophisticated output , we aim to combine VM- ( \] I3N with a flexible repair component . 
The system VM-GEN is used in the VI"llB-MOBIL scenario for multilingual generation  ( English , German , and . Japanese) . We mean by multilinguality that ; thesa . me processing is applie ( l for difl Z ' rent languages . In the underlying knowledge sources language -specific constraints are defined  . Default handling can be easily adapted to the requirements o\['multilingual generation \]  ) y using language-si ) ec i ( ? ic default-descriptions . 
For all know/edge sources the question aris-es how knowledge can be shared  . We Jut : end t : ouse core knowledge so ' urccs for representing common phenomena  .
