In our contribution for COLING 88(1III'88) , we introduced the concept of dialogical failure in the framework of dialogue games  , by defining rules for the operator F , where FA is to be interpreted as " A is not winnable in this stage of the dialogue "  . 
We showed that F can be employed in the formulation of provisional implications  . Provisional implications can be considered as the dialogical interpretation of defaults  . It was shown that our solution works well for a range of examples  . We concluded our paper with the announcement of a treatment of counteff actuals in terms of dialogical failure and of an implemented theorern prover for conditionals and counteff actuals based on our theoretical developments  . In this note we will briefly describe the considerations : leading to our treatment of counteff actuals and introduce the implementation of a theorem prover for conditionals as a subsystem of PROLOG  . For a more detailed description of the formal properties of the system we refer to  ( ttli . 91) .

LOGICAL ROLES 1 . If it were the case that A , then it would be the case that C is usually called a counteffactual  , because its antecedent is pretended not to have tile truth-value it " r cally " has  . Tichy(T . 84 ) shows that none of the prominent theories on counteff actuals is successfull on all members of a set of mostly very plausible test eases  , and wonders why it is , that in settling the validity of a counterctual , no body ever refers to such matters as world similarity and other wellknown paraphernalia of traditional counteffactual theory  . We take seriously Tichy's suggestion to look for the use of counteff actuals and formulate a semantics for counteffactuals not in terms of " troth " and " false hood "  , but rather in terms of what is done and not done in a dialogue in which a counterfactual ppears  . One thing which simply is qmt done " when discussing a eounter factual is the following : Suppose you forward the thesis " if kangaroos had notails  , they would top pleover "( I . 73 ) to somebody who has already admitted that kangaroos do have tails  . Suppose your adversary accepts the invitation to discuss  , and takes the antecedent of the counterfactuals a temporary additional concession  . Then it would be completely out of order Ibr you to claim to have w on the the discussion on the ground that your adversary has now " contradicted " himself  . t lowever , if contradicting one self-as an opponent-in a discussion is no longer a reason for losing that discussion  , then we seem to be playing according to roles which are similar to those for minimal calculus  . Define negation as implication of some absurd statement  , eg . a contradiction , "%":2 . -' A = A -> % In intuitionistic and in classical logic the proponent who utters the absurd statement loses against any thesis whatsoever  . Not so in minimal calculus : here the opponent , having uttered the absurd , loses only if he , in a later move , attacks the absurd broughtforward by the proponent  . However , count-effaetuals cannot simply be treated as implications in minimal calculus : Suppose Jones steps on the brake  ( B )  , and is " alive(A ) , and that is all we assume or admit . We will not accep the counteffactual " If Jones would not step on the brake  , then he would not be a live " as winnable ( i . e . holding ) under these circumstances . But in minimal calculus we have 3 . A , B ? -- B -> - ~ A = yesmin Suppose we add to tile concessions A and B a concession to the effect that stepping on tile brake is the only reason for Jones ' being a live  ( -- , B ->- , A ) . Now we will not want the counteffactual " If Jones would not step on tile brake  , then he would be a live " ( -1B->A ) to be whmable . But it is , since in minimal calculus we have 4 .

Wc the rel breneed two things : a treatment of negation which is even weaker than that of minimal calculus  , and the introduction of an opportuuity for the opponent to make us  ( " of hisown conccs siot~s as exception rules + The second of these is easily et lk ' ctuated : by inlroducing flK + fail-operator twice we cause a first change of rolcs which gives the opponent  , tm  was a tern porary proponent , the op+portunity to britlg additional concessions into play  , The second fail operator then restores the initial order of roles  . What we get is 5 . 1; ( A  ~ . > I ; ((;))() urcounterlhctual becomes , intuitively , " You , the opponent , will fail in showing that C fails , aft crA has been added to the concessions " .
