Attention on constraint-based grammar formalisms such as Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar  ( HPS6 ) has focussed on syntax and semantics to the exclusion of phonology  . This paper investigates the incorporation of a non-procedural theory of phonology into rmSG  , based on the ' one-level ' model of Bird & Ellison  ( 1992 )  . The standard rule-representation distinction is replaced by the description-object distinction which is more germane in the context of constraint-based grammar  . Prosodic domains , which limit the applicability of phonological constraints  , are expressed in a prosodic type hierarchy modelled on lfPSG'S lexical type hierarchy  . Interactions between phonology and morphology and between phonology and syntax are discussed and exemplified I  . 
1 Introduction
The exclusion of phonology from Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar  ( Pollard & Sag ,  1987 ) and related grammar frameworks belonging to the Montague tradition  ( Dowty et al , 1981; Shieber ,  1986 ) is no doubt due to the perception that much current theorising in phonology is excessively procedural in nature  . While there is an element of truth in this , it is also true that the predilection of constraint-based grammarians for a string-based phonology has predisposed them toward segmental phonology  , in which procedural thinking is at its peak . Other varieties of phonology -- most noably nonlinear phonology  ( Goldsmith ,  1976 , etseq . )--have now largely abandoned complex derivational accounts of phonological wellformedness in favour of systems of generalised constraints  . A defining property of constraints is that they are not applied in any particular order  . Rice (1989 ,  331 ) writes that " a general goal IT his research is funded by the U  . K . Science and Engineering Research Council , under grant GR/G-22084 Computational Phonology : A Constraim-Based Approach  . I am grateful to Mark Ellison , Ewan Klein and Bob Ladd for discussions relating to this work  . 
in recent phonological work has been the elimination of structure-changing processes from the grammar  . " With structure-changing process gone , all that constraints do is specify what it means for surface forms to be wellformed  2  . A consequence of this paradigm shift in phonology is that he main barrier to the incorporation of phonology into constraint-based grammar frameworks has now disappeared  . 
In trying to assess the consequences of this programme for phonology itself  , it would be instructive to identify four major ideasor principles that have characterised work in the Montague tradition  , out of which constraint-based grammar formalisms have grown  . The first is THEPRINCIPLEOF COMPOSITION-ALITY , which requires that he form and interpretation of an expression be a function of the form and interpretation of its parts  . This principle motivated Bach's wellknown RULE-TO -RULEHYPOTItESIS  , requiring that the linguistic modules ( such as syntax , semantics and phonology ) be organised in parallel rather than in series , where the output of one module is the input of the next  . The second principle is Partee's (1979 , 276) WELL-FOR MEDNES SCONS TRAINT , which states that wellformed expressions are buih up out of wellformed parts  . An immediate consequence of this is that there can benophonological ' repair strategies ' which operate on ill-formed structures  . 
A third principle goes by the linked terms INTENSION-ALITY and PARTIALITY  . The idea here is that there is a distinction to be drawn between linguistic descriptions and the objects they describe  ( such as pieces of speech )  . Descriptions can only ever be partial , in the sense that they pick out--- or DENOTE--- -classes of objects rather than individual objects  . For example , in a given language , \[+ voice \] denotes a class of speech sounds , \[+ nasal \] denotes another class , and \[+ voice , + nasal \] denotes the intersection of these two 2Historical note : There is a close parallel between this theoretical position and that adopted by Th ~ o Venneman  , Joan Hooper and Grover Hudson in the 70's in the theoretical framework known as Natural Generative Phonology  ( Hooper ,  1976) . More recently , Bach ( 1983 ) and Wheeler ( 1981 ) have independently adopted a similar stancer garding the incorporation fphonology into categorial grammar  . 
ACTESDECOLING-92 , NANTES , 2328 AO'~r199274 PROC . OFCOLING-92, NANTES , AUG . 2328, 1992 classes . Refining a description results in a smaller class of denoted objects  3  . The final principle is TIlE LF2OCALIST tP/POTIIESIS as expounded in its strong form by Bresnan and others  , which has lead to the lexicalisation of linguistic information and the corresponding simplification of phrase structure roles  . 
From these themes come such requirements that here be no extrinsic rule ordering  , no ' feature-changing ' , no intermediate lvels of representation , and so on ; all of them principles that many phonologists have independently come to embrace  . The ultimate implications of this perspective for phonology is the removal of the role -representation distinction in favour of the description-object distinction  4  . Grammar formalisms like IIPSG also lack the rule -representation distinction  . For exanlple , (1a ) is described by Pollard & Sag (1987 , 149) as a role . However , they also provide an equivalent statement of the rule in the more conventional ' rewrite ' notation  ( lb )  .

Section 2 presents the finite-state model of phonology advanced by Bird & Ellison  ( 1992 )  . This is followed by a section on a phonology -morphology interaction  ( nasalisationiTer Sna ) and a section on a phonology-syntax interaction ( complex NP shift )  . 
The paper concludes with a discussion of the shortcomings and future prospects of this work  . 
2 Finite-State Phonology
Over the last decade much has been written on the application of finite-state transducers  ( FSTs ) to phonol-~This model qheoretic viewpoint is explored in detail by Bird  ( 1990 )  . A first-order language , similar to Johnson's ( 1988 ) attribute-value language , is presented in which both phonological Stnletures and feature structures can be expressed  . Bird & Klein (1990 ,  53) , Pierrehumbert (1990 , 392) and Ilird & Ladd (1991 ,  206-7 ) discussomeramifications of this view of phonology  . 
4This new view of phonology has been investigated by Bird  ( t990 )  , Coleman (1991) . Scobbie ( 1991 ) and by the contributors to the collection ( \] Bird , 1991a ) . 
ogy , centering on the TWO-LEVEL MODEl . of Koskenniemi (1983) . Antworth ( 1990 ) gives a comprehensive introduction to the field . The two-level formalism is an attractive computational model for  1960's generative phonology . However , as has " already been noted , phonologists have since moved away from complex string rewriting systems to a range of socalled nmf linear models of phonology  . The central innovation of this more recent work is the idea that phonological representations are not strings of characters but collections of strings  , synchmnised like an orchestral score . 
There have been some notable recent attempts to rescue the FST model from its linearity in order to encompass nonlinear phonology  ( Kay , 1987; Koroai ,  1991) . l lowever , if a fundamental shift in perspective in phonology has indeed occurred  , then these refinement so the FST model do not go far enough  . 
We require a further estriction that a transducer can only add information : the set of symbols accepted on a particular cell of the ' surface ' tape must be a subset of the set accepted on the corresponding cell of the ' lexical ' tape  . An I ; ST so constrained is actually nothing more than a finite-state automaton  ( FSA )  . 
Consequently , FSAs would now seem to be more appropriate han FSTs for doing phonology  , so long as it is possible to come up with some way of encoding nonlinear phonology using FSAs  . In fact , this has been done by Bird & Ellison (1992) , who have shown how autosegmental TIF . RS , ASSOCIATIONS and RULES can been compassed by FSAs . The central idea is that each tier is a partial description of a string  , and tiers are put together using the intersection operation  ( vI ) defined on FSAs . 
Apart from being truer to current phonological theorizing  , this one-level model has a second important advantage over the two-level model  . Since the set of FSAs fomls a boolemt lattice under intersection  , union and complement , we can safely conjoin (' unify ') , disjoin and negate phonological descriptions . Such a framework is obviously compatible with constraint-based grammar fomudisms  . As it happens , tim currant usage of phonology in I1PSG is just a simple form of finite-state phonology of the k in delatx ~ rated here  . 
As our lirst example , consider the phenomenon of homorganic nasal assimilation  , where hynasals agree in place-of-articulation with the following consonant  . 
Thus , the sequence s\[mb\]and\[ndl are allowed while lind\]attd\[nb \] are ruled out  .  1  , etN = m , n , S = b , d , L = re , b and A = n , d . The required constraint can be expressed as the following regular expression  , A ? nESDI!COLING-92 , NAN rEs , 2328 Ao~r 199275 Pr to c . ov COLING-92, NANTt !

This states that it is not possible to lind anywhere a nasal-stop cluster  ( NS ) which is not made up of two labials ( LL ) or two alveolars ( AA )  . We can simplify the above expression as follows :   ( 2 )   . *( mA) . " VI . * ( nl , )fi The lirst conjunct of ( 2 ) corresponds to the following NFA ( all states are both start states and end states ) : rhm rnnA This automaton will accept any string , so long as every \[ m\] is followed by another \ [mlor by a ram-alveolar  ( A )  . The wlmle of expression ( 2 ) corm-sponds to the following NFA ( where again , all states are both start and end states ) : ~ q@m ( ) m ? _ < _ _ _ e ~ t l s~x / / \[ I m ~' / ( 5nBefore proceeding further with this example , it is necessary to define a PROSODICTYPI- IIIERARCIIY  . 
This is a subsumptionet work akin to the lexical hierarchy of t t PSG  ( Pollard & Sag ,  1987 , 191ff ) . Figure 1 displays a simple prosodic hierarchy . Each of the prosodic types denotes a set of phonetic objects  ( ? denotes the empty set )  . Since our descriptions are expressed using regular expressions  , it is useful to imagine regular expressions ( or automata ) as inhabiting the nodes of the prosodic hierarchy  . In English , nasal assimilation dries not occur across phrase bxmndafies and so the automaton given above must only constrain those stretches of segments that are phrases  . This localisation of the phonological constraint could be expressed as follows:  ( 3 ) phrase ( ~ m , @ mt2: ??
Nn Lnn
Cn
The tnp element in Figurel , namely phon-domain , denotes the space of utterances 5 . Phonological constraints like ( 3 ) serve to restrict this space , leaving just those utterances that are acceptable in the language  . 
The phonological specitication i any sign ( including a lexical sign ) is a member of this hierarchy . 
In some langttages we may require there to be a special kind of interaction between the lexical and the prosodic hierarchy  . For example , Archangeli & 5The hierarchy could be enriched with more types corresponding to languages  , dialects , speakers and registers . For example , certain phonological constraints apply m whole groups of languages  ( Calder & Bird ,  1991 ) .

If a tr was the type of harmonic utter , ' mecs , then we could express the necessary constraint hus6: noun=>atr . This kind of constraint is known as a morpheme structure constraint  , and phonologists have frequently needed to have recourse to thcse  ( Kenstowicz & Kissebetlh ,  1979 , 424 fl ) . A more recent example of the interaction between prosody and morphology is the field of prosodic morphology  ( McCarthy & Prince ,  1990) . 
A tinal question remains at xmt prosodic consti -tuency  . Suppose we wanted to state that a phrase consisted of one or more feet  . We could do this using a notation we have already seen  , as follows : However , in situations like this where it is easy to write a regular expression  , we will simply write : phrase ~ loot ~ where '+' is the Klecnephts  . Note that there is a subtle difference of inteqretation between this notation and a clause of a regular grammar  . If we write t ~-? and t ~ ~ h , where t is a type and where cp and ~/ ~ are regular expressions  , then both q ~ and g , inhabit the tnode of the prosodic type hierarchy  . We could have written equivalently t->Orq~/, . In contrast to this , if t -- , 4) and t ~? , are clauses of a regular grammar , t could be rewritten as either 0 or ~ , , i . e . 
i-,0 klg, . Now we progress to a more detailed example to illustrate the framework  . 
3 Phonology and Morphology " rer&ta is an Arawakan language spnken in Brazil  , described by Bendor-Sanuet (1970) . It has the li31-lowing segntent inventory : stops : p , t , k , ? fricatives : s , J ' , h , tt liquids : 1 , r , m , nsemivowels : y , w vowels : i , e , a , o , u 6Itere I assume that prosodic types at reactually lmperties of whole signs rather than just the phonology attribute  . 
The categoty of first person is marked by a prosody of nasalisation on both nouns mid verbs  , it stim data in Table 1 illustrates .

Pollard & Sag (1987 , 178) analyze complex NP shift , claiming that he ' moved ' constituent is focussed and that focussed constituents can violate  LP2  . They further claim that it is not possible to ' shift ' the constituent past an NP sister  . This leads to the constraint \[ MAJ-N\]<\[ FOCUS+\]  , which must be disjoined with the original LP2 as shown in ( 6 )  , a technique due to

This constraint conforms to more general observations that focussed material tends to appear sentence finally  ( Halliday ,  1967) . However , observe that in (4d ) , the ' shifted-over ' constituent is in fact an N ~'  , contrary to the \[ MAI-N\] requirement of ( 6 )  8 . The LP constraint must be revised as follows . 
(7) LP2 ( first revision):
COMPI .\[FOCUS-\]<~<~COMPL\[LFL~-\]
Unfocussed complements must precede more oblique phrasal complements  . 
It has frequently been observed that here is a prosodic constraint involved in the following data  ( based on
Culicover (1976, 156)): (4) a.



Mary\[called\[JohnI\[anelephant\]\]* Mary\[called\[anelephant\]\[John\]\] Mary\[called\[theman whostepped on her foot \]\[ anelephant\]\]Mary\[called\[an elephant \]\[ the man whostepped on her foot \] \] In generative syntax this is called complex  ( or ' heavy ' ) NP shift , since it involves the movement of a direct object NP past another complement or adjunct  , and this movement is only possible if the phrase being moved is sufficiently large  . Recall that Pollard and Sag's grammar for English has two linear precedence constraints  . The first ( LP1 ) states in effect hatheads precede complements . The second ( LP2 ) states that the ordering of complements respects he obliqueness hierarchy  . LP2 is repeated below ; the symbol '<<' is the obliqueness ordering carried over into phonology  ( Pollard & Sag ,  1987 ,  174) . 
FOCUS is clearly not the only factor involved in complex NP shift  . Sentence ( 4b ) is bad regardless of whether or not john is focussed  . An interesting attempt to unravel the prosodic contribution to this phenomenon has been made by Zec & lnkelas  ( 1990 ,  376-7) . According to them , a prosodi constituent is said to bett EAVY just in case it branches  . This is familiar in the case of syllables : a heavy syllable is one having two  ( or more ) moms , while a light syllable only has one ( Hyman ,  1984) . Rather then presenting the details of their analysis  , I shall present a liberal adaptation of it that is more suited to the phonological framework assumed here  . 
Suppose that an intonational phrase consists of a sequence of stress feet  9  , feet consist of syllables and syllables consist of segments  . Using the notation described in section 2 , we could write : 8 Culic over (1976 , 155-6) gives more xamples to support this claim . Other verbs allowing movement past an NP are the L  ) I verbs of ( Quirk et al .  1972, 850) . Dative verbs do not permit complex NP shift . 
9Whether there is intervening material between the phrase and the foot is immaterial to the present discussion  . 
AcrEsDECOLING-92 , NANTES , 2328 AOI ) T199278 PROC . OFCOLING-92, NANTES , AUG .  2328 , 1992 phrase = t , foot+foot:~syl+syl:=?-kalt_lstept J fot U  6a t_l ? .   . 
To this we add some further constraints . First , heavy phrases ( phrase h ) must contain two or more feet . 
Second , feet consist of exactly one heavy syllable , while all other syllables must be light . Third , the vowel of a light syllable must be asch wa . 
phrase h = ~ foot foot + foot ~, vyl ~, ~ ylh . vyl~syl I :: ?, C*~C "
C~bUdtJ6HfLIgt_l ...
Although these specifications are admittedly rather crude  , they are sufficient for present purposes . The next step is to set up an abbreviation to enable heavy and light phrases to be picked out easily  . 
tIEAVY=\[PHON phrase h\]
LIGIIT ~\[ PHON phrase t\]
Now we can formulate an ordering principle that accounts for the observed behaviour  . This is done by modifying LP2 . 
(8) LP2 ( final version ):
COMPL\[LIGtT\]<((COMPI,\[LEX-1
Light complements mu . vt precede more oblique phrasal complements . 
Clearly , a combination of ( 7 ) and ( 8 ) is needed if Pollard and Sag's observations are to be linked with those of Zecandlnkelas  . However , such are line-ment would still be inadequate . The acceptability of shifting of an NP actually gets worse as the size of the material between the verb and the NP gets larger  . Thus the relative weight of the complements is important  . 
It is apparent that the spectrum of relative weights interacts with the obliqueness ordering in a gradient manner that cannot be adequately dealt within the polarised fashion of linear precedence constraints  . 
5 Conclusion
In the course of this paper I have presented a phonological framework and shown how it might be interfaced with IIPSG  . The frmnework starts where HPSG left off , in the sense that \] IPSG's phonology attribute- -a list--can be viewed as a subclass of automata  . The framework is potentially far-reaching in the sen~that it encompasses nonlinear phonology  ( Bird & Ellison ,  1992) . Although this work is preliminary , it is all eady clear how several standard phonological devices may be recast in this new framework  . 
For exanrple , the traditional distinction between morphophonology and phonology proper and the distinction between lexical and post lexical phonology can be modelled in terms of the distinction between lexical and prosodic hierarchies  . The traditional prosodic domains ( phrase , foot , syllable ) are recast as types , and domain-bounded processes are regular expressions tied to the required prosodic type  . 
One area of morphophonology that has not been touched on here is the situation where the selection of an allomorph is sensitive to the phonological context  . 
A wellknown example of this is the a ~ an altema -tion in English  . One solution would be to represent contextual in lbm~ation as part of the phonology attribute of a sign by associating prosodic types with final states  . 
c::~C .* v~-V .*
When this morpheme is concatenated with a following noun  , these prosodic types must be brough to bear on the following material  . 
Another area for i ' urther work is to investigate interactions between phonology and semantics  . For example , it is often observed that there is a close correspondence between intonational phrases and a particular semantic cluster called a sense unit  , whereby any stretch of material that correspol : tds to an intonational phrase must also qualify as a sense unit  ( Bird , 1991b ) . 
Previous accounts of this phenomenon have required the mediation of a syntactic module and this has lead to an extra level of complexity  ( e . g . Selkirk (1984, 290-296)) . Now there is the exciting prospect of being able to explore phonology-semantics interactions directly  . For example , given suitable definitions , we could simply writc:PIIRASE~-SI , ' . NSE-UNIT . 
It is hoped that further work in this vein will lead to a nonlinear model of phonology that is fully integrated into constraint-based grammar formalisms  . This will open the way for applications of such frameworks to a much wider range of the world's languages  .
