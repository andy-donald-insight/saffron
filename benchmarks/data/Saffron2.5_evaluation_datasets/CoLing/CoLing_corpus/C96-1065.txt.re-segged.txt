Abstract
The focus of this article is the integration of two different perspectives on lexical semantics : Discourse Representation Theory's  ( DRT ) inferentially motivated approach and Semantic Emphasis The-ory's  ( SET ) lexical field based view . A new joined representation format is developed which is exemplified by analyses of German verbs  . The benefits thereofare on both sides . DI/Tgains basic entries for whole lexical fields and  , further lnore , a systematic interface between semantic and syntactic argument structures  . SET profits both from the much larger semantic overage and from the finegrained lexical analyses which reflect inferential behaviour  . 
1 Introduction
The construction of lexical entries is one of the crucial and challenging tasks given in the field of computational linguistics  . In the ideal case , lexical entries fulfill , among others , two requirements . 
First , the representations are suitably finegrained such that they capture lexeme-speeific distinctions  . Second , the lexical entries are sufficiently general , for reflecting similarities between single lexemes  . Furthermore , the information they contain should systematically link various levels of description  , e . g . syntax and semantics as well as referential and inferential potential  . The latter is of special interest for text analysis as opposed to sentence analysis  ( eft for example ( Haenelt , 1994); ( Haenelt and KSnyves-Tdth ,  1991)) . 
Corresponding to these requirements , we exploit the specific strengths of two distinct semantic theories  . These theories are Discourse Representation Theory  ( DRT )   ( ( Kamp and Reyle , 1993); ( FraCaS-DS ,  1994 ) ) and Semantic Emphasis Theory ( SET ) ( ( Kunze , 1991); ( Kunze ,  1993)) . 
However , our central goal is an integration of D113' and SET . It will be shown that this integration is possible and of benefit to both theories as well as to the construction of lexical entries  . To achieve our overall objective , the following four points will be exemplified by joined representations of German verbs : ? DRT profits from SET's systematic derivations of thematic roles and of morpho-syntaetic features on the basis of predicate-argument-structures  . These features include both grammatical and prepositional case  . 
? DRT gains a purely semantically motivated orientation towards lexical fields  . 
? Dll\[l'covers much more semantic phenomena than SET  . Therefore , DIT offers SET the possibility to test its results against a semantic background that e  . g . includes plurals , tenses , and attitudes . 
? DRT's finegrained lexical analyses are grounded in inferential behaviour  . These lexical distinctions mark possible starting points for refining SET's representations  . 
The paper is structured as follows : DRT's and SET 's basic motivations  , principles and formal means concerning lexical semantics are retraced ~ n sections  2 and 3  . The new joined representation format is introduced in section  4 by analysing the German verbs leihen ( in its variant to lend ) and verschenken ( in its variant to give as a present )  . 
Moreover , section 4 provides evidence that the four main points stated above are backed up by the joined analyses  . Finally , directions for further research are pointed out in section  5  . 
2 DRT - - In fe rent ia l l y Mot ivated Discourse RepT~sentation Theory  ( DRT ) is first and foremost a theory about discourse interpretation  , i . e . , it is essentially textually oriented in natm'e . The meaifing of sequences of sentences is seen as strongly connected with their ealse in antics in tile  Dll2F frm new or l ? ( ( Kam I ) and R of l deutscher , 1994a ); ( Kamp and Rotldeutscher , 1994b ); ( ll . ot adeutscher , 1994)) investigate . s the role of lexieal information in supporting inferences  . Consequently , lexical distinctions correlate with non -equiw flent sets of associated inference  . s . 
The following (' . xalnt ) lesillustrate that the German verb leihen ( in its variant to lend ) implies in ( : ontras to the German vert ) verse henken ( in its variant to give as a present ) the lending t ) erson's belief in a return of the involved object , : ( la ) Calvinlciht II obbeseine Krawatte .

3 SET--Lexical Field Based
Semantic Emphasis Th . e or y ( SET ) has identified princit ) les that allow to link a prototypical description of a situation to a number of prototypical meaning descriptions of con  ( : retelexeines link is based on a set of well -defined and systematically occurring mappings  ( cf . ( Firzlaff and Kunze , 1995)) rather than on intuitive criteria . 
Given a basic semantic form ( BSF ) as a cornmon starting point , we derive semantic and syntactic case frames and construct prototypical meaning descriptions of concrete lexemes by refining the BSF  . Additionally , the rule based interpretation of a BSF delivers a prototypical description of the corresponding situation  . 
The set of lexemes that are suitable to refer to the same situation constitutes a lexical field  . 
The field as a whole is characterized by a BSF . ABSF is a propositional description . It consists of a predicate and an mnber of arguments  , each of which is either a predicate-argument structure or an elementary argunlent  . In general , elementary arguments are represented by variables that have to be filled in by phrases which denote reference objects  ( participants of a situation )  . 
The number of arguinents , as well as the decision whether the arguments are elementary or propositional  , both depend on tim predicate that , directly takes these arguments . We derive the participants ' ttminatic roles ( deep cases ) in acc of dance with a set of general rules . Semant ; ically , each pair of a role and the predicate directly dominating an elementary argument demands particular selectional features for that argument  . The BSF describing the field of change-of -possession  ( with one object to be transihrred ) and the derived deep cases are given in Figure 3 .

BEC(HAVE(q , u )))) u : ( to-obj , have)
Figure 3. BSF and deel ) cases.
From both the syntactic and the semantic point of view  , the BSF delivers the maximum case frame of the lexemes that constitute the lexical field  . 
Some of the roles of the maximum case frame can be put into the foreground  ; these are said to have cmp has is . Some roles nmst not be verbalized explicitly ; these are said to be blocked . In the subset of roles that are not blocked there are  , on the one hand , roles referring to obligatory actants and , on the other hand , roles referring to optional actants . 
Which roles have emphasis and which do not have emphasis  , which are the ones that must be verbalized , and which are the ones that need not be verbalized is determined according to general rules  . 
Exploiting the field specific possibilities to make some variables denote the same reference object  ( by renaming of variables ) results in more specific BSFs . These then describe partial lexical fields like , e . g . to give or to take . 
By adding infbrmation about , emphasis and blocking of roles , a BSF is transformed into a number " of prototypieal meaning descriptions  . We can then derive systematically which are the suitable grammatical realizations of each role  . However , there are two important points concerning the determination of which grammatical realizations are possible : Firstly  , the predicate that takes the corresponding elementary argument directly and  , secondly , the choice of that subset of roles of tim maximum case frame that are not blocked  . One of the three prototypical ineaning descriptiol m that constitute the partial field of to  9ire and tile gram-rnatical case assiglmmnt of verschenke  , n1 is given in Figure 4 . ( Those parts of l ; he description t ; hat have emphasis are written in boldface . Tile occurence of a variable preceded by " T " is blocked  .

However , BSFs do not only provide the ground for the derivation of grammatical features  . They are also suitable to derive prototypieal situation descriptions  . In order to do so , instantiation rules must be applied to a BSF in a recursive way  . 
The application of instantiation ruh ; s has to be regarded as an interpretation of every partial description in a BSF  . Some of these parts are , then represented by variables that have to be filled in by objects referring to states or  (  ; vents , and other parts deliver relationships between these states or events  . In addition , some of the instantiation rules provide temt ) oral and/or spatial constraints that are applicable to  ( tim corresponding parts of ) a prototypical situation description , e . g . , etimc is a mapping fl'om the set of events or states to the set of temporal entities  ( etime : g-+T )  . 
In general , tile instantiation rules provide struc-1Generally   , this grammatical case assignment is suitable for about  20 verbs of the partial field to give .

The axioms have in common that they involve the concept CIIANGE-SlC  , N(cf . c2 in Figure 5) . The axioms are given in Figure 6 ( " O " denotes temporal overlapping )  .

The concepts defined by means of these axioms are , then , used to specify the lexical entry of ver -schenken  ( in its variant to ( live as a present )  . The thematic roles and the corresponding grammatical realizations result from the derivation presented in section  3  . PRE(CHANGI , 2-SIGN ) delivers the first part of verschenken's presupposition  . The parameter STATE is filled in by DISP & OWN which is added to the predicate hierarchy sketched already as a specialization of the predicate IIAVF  . 
Thereby , it is possible to distinguish between the pure disposal and the disposal thai  ; is accompanied by ownership . 
Furthermore , verschenken's presupposition i-cludes the semantic roles delivered by its prototypical meaning description  . However , the selectional restrictions for discourse referents do not differ from the restrictions given in the prototypical situation description  ( cf . Figure 5) . With respect o the semantic interpretation , each of source-have , goal-have , and locat-have just means is suitable as first ar . qument in a IIAVE-proposition . Generally , the predicate directly determines the selectional restrictions of its arguments  , i . e . , the discourse referents . Furthermore , for those predicates that take more than one argument  , it is the order of the arguments which additionally determines the selectional restrictibns  .   4 In accordance with the prototypical situation description given in Figure  5 the DRS for ver-seheuken is as follows: 4Clear ly , these are . iust two pieces of information for the seleetional restrictions  .

The entities constituting ec(the action , the transitions , and the causation ) are located in a common time span . Therefore , the transitions ' initial states precedeec ( so:: ) (7_ ee ) and the transitions ' final states followec ( ecDCst )  . 
The lexical entry of leihen ( in its variant to lend ) consists of an interface list , whose thematic roles are based on SET , and of semantic structures , which include and extend verse henken's semantic components  . The inferential behaviom ' of leihen ( exemplified in section 2 ) motivates a for-real description that contains more than the basic distinctions provided by the partial lexical field to give  . Additionally , there is the lending person's belief in a return of the involved object  , in other words , the belief that the CHANGE-SIGN from so to s ~ is temporary  . Therefore , leihen's represen-t at , ions make use of CIIANGE-SIGN's subconcept CIIANGE-SIGN-TEMP  . This subconcept entails ; t transformation of its superconcept's prestate So  ( so DCec ) to its superconcept's post states ~ ( ee DCsl ) as well as the new post states 2 ( ec~s . e ), i . e . the belief in a return of the involved object .
