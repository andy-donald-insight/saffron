Abstract
This paper presents a project report on NP , a working Natural language Plan inference system that uses feature structures and is based on assumptions  . Input to the system is in the form of feature structures  , which can be taken directly from the output of a semantic parser  . Plan actions are represented by feature-structure plan schemata with preconditions  , hier-arclfical decompositions , and effects . Output is in the form of a network of believed assertions represented in a knowledge base  , and can be reported , used to answer generation-system queries , or drive side-effecting demons . The plan inference component is implemented using a feature-structure-based inference ngine and models of plan recognition  , prediction , and inference . The inference ngine is implemented using a rewriting system for patteru-matct fing  , and an Assumption-based Truth Maintenance System ( ATMS ) for conjunctions . The ArMS allows pre-instantiation f hypothetically known assertions and implications  , which can significantly reduce processing time . The ATMS also permit simultaneous consideration of multiple possible inputs or multiple possible inferred plan outputs  ; these can be mutually conflicting or supportive . 
This capability will be important for disambiguation  . The NP system is used to infer dialog-and domaln-level pans  , among other types . 
Original contributions include : a plan inference system that works directly from feature structures  ; a plan inference system that uses an ATMS and planschem actions with preconditions and effects to infer hierarchical nd chained plans  ; and , an inference ngine that works with multiple feature-structure assertions and rules  . 
Project Goal . This project is aimed toward a dialog understanding system that can be used as part of an automatic interpreting telephone system  . 
Interpretation will be performed by parsing , transferring , and generating utterances . Thus , dialog understanding will be used to recognize speech acts and illocutionary acts  , resolve ellipses , and provide required missing information , among other tasks . The understanding system will use the output of the semantic parser  , and provide information to the transfer module and generation system  . Therefore , feature structure should be used as the basic data representation scheme  . Dialog understanding requires a general-purpose plan inferencengine that can work with dialog plans  , domain plans , common sense knowledge plans , and so forth . The system must also in the future be able to perform disambiguation of possible utterances  . 
Background : Assumptions . The plans , intentions , beliefs , etc . , of a human are menial concepts which cannot be perceive directly '  , they are unobservable\[Mye88\] . There is insufficient information to represent these concepts with certainty  . 
Therefore , the system must be able to represent concepts in an uncertain manner  , using assumptions . 
Communication between two people is inherently an assumption-based process  . Since it is never corn-pletely possible to directly know the concepts of another person  , it is necessary in the course of a conversation to take a stance and rely on assumptions about the other person's thoughts\[  Den87\]  . Thus , in a dialog understanding system , there are at least wo kinds of assumptions that must be represented : assumptions that the two speakers make  , which must be modeled by the system , and assumptions that the system makes about he situation  , 1 the two speakers and their plans , intentions , etc . 
Design . Plan inference and other knowledge-based reasoning tasks require that multiple conjunctive implications be matched against large sets of unordered assertions  . The system will have a catalog of world knowledge  , common sense knowledge , and assertions which are believed by the speakers . 
These must be accessed non-sequentially and used for reasoning  . In other words , language understanding should be done by using an " expert system " inferencengine  , Computer languages should be used according to their strengths and weaknesses  . Feature-structure systems are strong in representing complex  , incomplete , or underspecified information , and in performing unification . However , they are extremely inefficient at list processing and numerical culations  ( e . g . 
for evidential reasoning ) , and don't represent multiple possible worlds . Lisp and other languages can fulfil these needs . 
One solution is to build a hybrid system . An inference ngine was built which uses a feature -structure language for representation ad pattern-matching tasks  , while using an ATMS to perform conjunctive implications  , represent assumptions , represent possible worlds , and maintain the truth of derived belief networks when nonmonotonic changes occur  . The ATMS allows the system to represent , and reason with , all consistent possibilities at the same time-not just the current best choice  . 
In particular , this permits multiple possible inferred plans to be output  , and multiple possible observations to be input . This capability will become important for possible utterance disambiguation  . 
The system interprets the results of the ATMS by using a five-valued uncertainty logic consisting of the uncertain belief values ACTUAL  , POSSIBLE , HY-POT HETICAL , INCONSISTENT , or NULL . Each as ser-1 Currently , most dialog understanding system start with the assumptions that the hearer and speaker always understand each other perfectly  , that they automatically want to cooperate as much as possible  , and that they have absolutely no other commitments outside of the conversation  . Clearly some of these assumptions can occasionally be incorrect  .

Since the . hlferenc cengine is ill turn based on an ATMS , the plan infereuce n ' ethod also inherits ( he capabilities of representing po , ; sibh . ( assulned ) or actual asserlions . The representation carefully distinguishes between actual  , possible , predicted , and hy-pol . hctical occurrences . Mul\[ipleself-consistent pos-sibilitics can be represented  . This results in in for red plans also being possible or actual  .

The instruction rules are fed to the nonmonotonic rewriting system\[  Has89\] and used as rewriting rules . 
Preinstantiation assertions are input to the rewriting system  . One assertion may match several instruction rule patterns  . The recognized consequents consist of instructions with instantiated variables  . These are fed to the instruction interpreter , which follows the instructions and instantiates hypothetical nodes and implications in the ATMS corresponding to instantiated components of the plan schema  . The resulting action and effect assertions are fed back to the rewriting system as more hypothetical input  , to instantiate whole networks bottom-up from single input facts  . Since the ATMS uses " uniquification " and never reinstantiates xist-ing assertions  , this process eventually terminates . 
Runtime utterances are submitted to a feature -structure hash test which checks to see whether they have identically been instantiated in the ATMS before  ( e . g . , hypothetically , etc . ) . If they have , no further pattern matching is required , and the corresponding node is asserted . Otherwise , the input utterance is submitted to the rewriting system for pattern matching and hypothetical instantiation propagation  , as before . Following this , the corresponding node is asserted as possible or actual  . Assertion triggers a fast spreading activation in the truth maintenance network  ( using bit vectors ) which maintains all consistent " possible worlds  "  . A demon attached to a particular node fires when that node first becomes possible or actual  . Demons can reset themselves by deleting support node flags  . 
Current Status . NP version 2 . 0 , reported here , has been finished and demonstrated . Currently instantiation is done in a bottom-up fashion  . A graphic output program allows display of the ATMS network  . Nodes can be moused for input or examination . A browsing editor needs to be improved to allow relevant parts of the network to be examined  . 
The system currently works standalone and is ready to be integrated with a parser  , a transfer system , and a language generator when they have been finished  . 
Applications . The plan inference system understands ongoing task-oriented conversations between two people  , on the subject of registering for a conference . The system serially processes the utterances , maintaining a representation f the currently believed concepts as the conversation progresses  . 
Currently , input to the system is a corpus of five conversations  ( 20 utterances each , on average ) representing the expected feature-structure output of the ATR parsing system  , as generated by the parsing researchers . To date , 53 plan schemata have been written , dealing with conversation opening and closing sequences  , " inform-if " ( yes/no ) questions and answers , short answers to questions , ability utterances , inferred knowledge , wants and intentions , domain plans , idioms , and common sense knowledge . 
The system understands portions of all five conversations  . Research is ongoing in this area . In addition , a separate set of 46 plans duplicating the " four-layer " recognition model\[  AI89\] in feature structures has been implemented and used to understand an entire surface-speech-act -level input conversation with  20 speech-acts ( ee Figure 2 )  ;   232 feature-structure assertions were instantiated . 
Future Work . A manual is being written . The instantiation method must be improved , l ~ e present-ing multiple possible nonmonotonic plans is being researched  . It will also be necessary to represent and infer plans containing conditional branches  , for information-gathering plans in the sample dialogs  4  . 
However , the main fimlre research deals with the design of a disambiguation system  . Disambiguation is an evidential reasoning problem  , and will probably require that a causal reasoning system be built and integrated with the multiple -world ATMS  . 
Naturally , parallel research in illocutionary and perlocutionary force is also continuing  . One of the first things that must be done is to build a module that uses possible plans to resolve zero pronouns  . 
Lack of a fully resolved utterance is hindering plan recognition  . Other work involves representing and reasoning with intentions found in a dialog  . 
Coneluslon . A working plan inference system that uses feature structures has been d  ,  . scribed . The system can represent and reasou with assumptions  , multiple possible inputs , and multiple possible results . Preinstantiation fhypotheticals sertions allows inference by fast spreading activation  . The resulting system can be used to infer plans directly from the output of as ?  . naantic ~ , parser , and provide information directly to a transfer or generation system  , as part of an automatic interpretation system .
