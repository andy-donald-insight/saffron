In this paper , the similarity of " multi-vahw label fimction " and " complex features " iv discussed  . The author especially era . 
phasizes the necessity of complex feattwes for description of Chinese Iaruguage  . 
1 Multiple-Value Label Function
The phrase structure grammar ( PSG ) was used extensively in the parsing of natural lawguage  . APSG can be expressed by a tree graph where every node has a correspondent label  . 
The relationship between the node x and its label y can be described by a mono-value label function L : 
L(x ) = y
For every value of node x , there is only one corresponding value of label y . 
In 1981 , we designed a multilingual automatic translation system FAJRA  ( from Chinese to French , English , Japanese , Russian , German ) . In 1985 ; we designed two automatic translation systems GCAT  ( from German to Chinese ) and FCAT ( from French to Chinese )  . In system FAJRA , we must do automatic analysis of Chinese , in system GCAT and FCAT , we must do automatic generation of Chinese language  . We found that the linguistic features of Chinese ex  . . . 
pressed by the mono-value label function of PSG is rather limited  . In the automatic analysis of Chinese language , PSG cannot treat properly the ambiguity , the result of analysis often bring about a lot of ambiguous structures  . In the automatic generation of Chinese language , the generative power of PSG is so strong that a lot of ungrammatical sentences are generated  . It is the chief drawback of PSG . In order to overcome this drawback of PSG , in system FAJRA , we proposed a multiple-value label function to replace the mono-value label function  , and in systems GCAT and FCAT , we further improved this approach . 
A multiple-value label function can be described as below : 
L(x ) = y ~ , Y2, . . . , Y ~ whereby a label x of tree can correspond to several abels y ~  , ya ,   .   .   . , y = . By the mean sol ; this function , the generative power of PSG was restricted , the number of ambiguou structures were reduced , and the drawback of PSG wasefl\]ciently overcome . 
Beginning with the augmented transition etwork ( ATN ) concept and . inspired by J . Bresnan's work on lexically oriented non -transformational linguistics  , the lexical functional grammar ( LFG ) framework of J . Bresnan and R . Kaplan was evolved . Simultanously , M . Kay devise(\] . 
the functional m~Afication grammar ( FUG ) . , G . G ~ dar , E . Klein and G . Pullum proposed . 
the generalized phrase structure grammar ( GPSG ) . Implementation of GPSG at Hewtett-Packardled C . Pollard and his collcgues to design the head -driven phrase structure grm:amar  ( HPSG ) as a successor to GPSG . In all these formalisms of grammars , the complex features are widely used to replace the simple feature of PSG and it is an improvement of PSG  . Therefore , The concept of complex features is very important for present development of computational linguistics  . 
In the systems I ; A , IRA , GCAT and FCAT , the values of labels must be the features of language  , so the mtd tiple-value labels must be also the complex features of language  . In fact , the concept of multiple--value labels and the concept of complex features is very similar  . 
Historically , all these concepts are the results of separate researches in computational linguistics for improvement of PSG  . Th Lts we can take our multiple-value labels as complex features  . 
The famous linguist De Saussure ( 1857--1913 ) had pointed out in his < Course in General Linguistics >: " Language in a manner oi " speaking  , is a type of algeb , a consisting solely of complex terms " ( p122 , English version ,  1959) . He takes the flexion of " Nacht:N ~ / chte " in German as the example  . The relation " Nacht : Niichte " c:m be expressed by an algebraic formula a/bin which a and b are not simple terms but result from a set of relations  .   .   .   . complex terms . The complex terms of Nacht are : norm , feminine gender , singular number , nominatix ' e case , its principal vowel is " a " . The complex terms of N ' ~ . chteare : noun , feminine gender , plural number , nominative case , its principal vowel is " fi " , its ending is " e " , the pronunciation of " ch " changes from/x/to /C  . ' . DeSaussure said : " But language being what it is  , we shall find nothing simple in it regardlesso F our approach  ; everywhere and always there is the stone conlplex equilibrium of *" ~  ,  1959) . So~e~m , that mutually condition each other " ( P122 , E . v . 
called " complex terms " mentiot ~ ed here by Dc Saussure is nothing but the " complex features " or the " multiple-value labels " in computation a ! linguistics  . After all , DeSaussure is a scholar with a foresight , fie has proved himself to be a pioneer of modern linguistics  . The concept of ' ~ omplex terms " oCD e Saussure has served as a source of inspiration for tks to proposed the concept of " muhiple-value labels "  . However , the property of Chinese language is more important than the concept of DeSaussure in the dex  . elopmemntofour " multiple -- value labels " ( or " complex features " )  , because without the " multiple-value labels " ( or " complex features " ) we cannot adequately describe the Chinese language in the autornatic translation  . 
2 Necessity of Complex Feature for Description of Chinese Language If there is a necessity of complex features in description of ' English  , then this necessity is more obvious fbr description of Chinese  . 
The reasons are as following : 1 . There is not one--to--one correspondence relation between the phrase types  ( or parts of speech ) m~d their syntactic functions in the Chinese sentences  . 
Chinese is dil Rrent from Endish . In English , the phrase types generally correspond to their syntactic functions  . For example , we have NP+VP--->S in English , whereby NP corresponds to subject , VP corresponds to predicate , and S is a sentence , becoming a construction " i19 subject + predicate " . There is a one-to-one correspondence between the phrase types and their syntactic ftmctions  . In Chinese , the structure " NP+VP " can form a sentence , so we have also NP+VP-->S . E . g . in phrase " d~2E/IN ~" ( little Wang coughs ) , "/\] xt " ( little Wang ) is a NP , " ~ N ~" ( to cough ) is a VP , forming a construction " suk ! ject . + predicate " . However , in many cases , the NP doesn't correspond to the subject , the VP doesn't correspond to the predicate . For example , " ~ y ~; / i ~ ~- t " ( progrmming ) in Chinese ,  "  . ~ j : ~"( program ) is a NP , " iRi-l " ( . to design ) is a VP , but this NP is a modifier , and this VP is the head of the structure " NP + VP "  . The structure " NP+VP " cannot form a sentence  , but fbrma new noun phrase NPI:NP+VP-->NP  \[  . So this noun phrase becomes a construction " modifier + head "  . Similar example are : " i ~ -- N/~\]~" ( langtuage learning )  , " ~ ~ ~ / rN - ~" ( physics examination ) , etc . In these phr ~ , ~ses , the phrase tyws " NP + VP " cannot form a construction " subject + predicate "  , but form a construction " modifier - ~: head " . In this case , the " NP+VP " is a syntactically ambiguous structure  , the simple features " NP + VP " cannot distinguish the differences between the construction " subject + predicate " and the construction " modifier + head "  . We must use the complex features to describe these differences  . 
The structure " NP-I-VP " which forms a construction " subject + predicate " can be formularized as following complex  . feature set :
CAT=N+CAT--=V\[_\[_SF=SUBJ_SF=PRED _t_where by K is the feature of " the phrase type  , NP and VP are the values of this feature ; CAT is the feature o\["the parts of speech , N and V are the values of this feature ; SF is the feature o ~" syntactic function , SUB . I and PRED are the values of this feature . With the complex features , the structure " NP+VP " which forms a construction " modifier + head " can be for mutarized as following : 
CAT = N+CAT = V
SF = MODF_SF = HEAD where by MODF and HEAD are the values of the feature SF  . 
Obviously , the structure " NP+VP " is ambiguous , there are two syntactically different constructions included in this structure  , their phrase types are identical , but their syntactic functions are different . In order to adequately discribe the differences of them  , we have to use the complex features indeed . 
In English , we have VP+NP-->VP1 , the VP corresponding to the predicate : , the NP to the object , and VP1 is a new verb phrase , it is a construction " predicate + object " . In Chinese , the structure " VP + NP " can form a new verb phrase  , so we have also VP+NP-->VP1 . For example ,  "$ , -\]~/~/ I'~'\]~" ( to discuss a problem ) in Chinese , "$?i " ~" ( to dis-cttss ) is a VP , " l'~-i \] ~" ( problem ) is a NP , forming a new verb phrase " predicate + object " . 

However , in many cases , VP doesn't correspond to predicate , NP doesn't correspond to object . For example , "/ di~lR/GN"(taxicab ) in Chinese , " ~ f t " ( to hire ) is a VP , " ~"( automobile ) is a NP , but this VP is a modifier and this NP is the head of the structure " VP + NP "  . This structure cannot form a new verb phrase , it forms a new noun phrase , so we have : VP+NP-->NP1 . The syntactic function of this noun phrase is a construction " modi\[ier + head "  . The similar examples are : "~-~/-_)7 ~ , "( approach for reseach ) , " ~/ ~" ( regulation for study) , " ~ P ~ , Yk / i ~" ( policy of openning the door ) . The phrase type , ; tructure " VP + NP " can not form a construction " predicate+object "  , but forms a construction " modifier + head " . In this case , the structure " VP+NP " is syntactically ambiguous  . The simple features " VP + NP " is not enough to distinguish the differences between the construction " predicate + object " and the construction " modifier + head "  . WemLmt use the complext ~: atures to describe these differences  . 
The structure " VP + NP " which forms a formularized as following complex feature set : 
IK = VP
CAT=V+_SF=PRED_construction " predicate+ object " can be 
K = NP-IdCAT=NSF = OBJE_
I whereby PRED and OBJE are the values
The structure " VP + NP " which formularized as following complex feature 
IK = VP
CAT = V
SF = MODF_of feature SF .
forms a construction " modifier set:-I-IK = NP  -1 CAT=N!SF = HEAD2 + head " can be where by MODF and HEAD are the values of feature SF  . 
Obviously we can not only use the simple f cature to describe the structure " VP + NP "  , we have to use the complex features . 
2 . For the construction which have the same phrase type structure and the same syntactic function structure  , its semantic relation may be diflErent . So there is not simple one--to-one correspondence between the syntactic function and its semantic relation  . 
The values of semantic relation feature are the following : agent  , patient , instrument , scope , aim , : result ,  . . . etc . In English , there is no much correspondences between the syntactic function of sentence lement and its semantic relation  . In Chinese , the correspondence is more complicated and sophisticated than in English  . 
In the construction " subject + predicate " with corresponding phrase type structure " NP+VP '  , the subject may be agent , but it may also be patient , or instrument , etc . For example , in the sentence " i If ~/ i ; ~ T " ( I have read ) , the subject ": ffB"(I ) is the agent , but in the sentence "-- p / ~ T " ( the book has been read )  , the subject "@" ( book ) is the patient , and the verb " i ~ T " ( to read ) doesn't change its form , it always takes the original form . In most European languages , if the subject is the agent , then the verb must take an active form , and if always keeps the same form no matter whether the subject is an agent or a patient  . In an overwhelming majority of cases , the passive form of verb is seldom or never used in Chinese  . By this reason , in the atttomatic information processing of Chinese language  , it is not enough to only use the features of phrase types and synt~tic functions  , we must use the features of semantic relations , thus the features for description of Chinese language will become mor ~ complex  . 
In the structure " NP + VP " , if the syntactic function of NP is subject , and the semantic relation of NP is agent , then the complex features of this structure can be formularized as following :\[ K=NP~K=VP\] 
CAT = N+CAT = V\]
SF = SUBJlk . SF = PREDJ
LSMAGENT_I whereby SM is the feature of semantic relation  , AGENT is the values of feature SM . 
In the structure " NP+VP' , if the syntactic function of NP is subject and the semantic relation of NP is patient  , then the complex features of this structure can be formularized as fol-lowing: 
K = NP tCAT = N
SF=SUBJ_SM = PATIENT_+iK = VP 1 CAT = VSF . = PRED where by PATIENT is the value o\[feature SM  . 
In the strcture " VP+NP " with corresponding syntactic construction " predicate+object "  , the object may be a patient , but it may also be an agent , or an instrument , or a scope , or an aim , or a result ,   .   .   . , etc . In the sentence "~$/~- Y " ( to wipe the window )  "~"  ,   . ~ , ( to wipe ) is the predicate , " ~" ( window ) is the object , and its semantic feature is the patient . 
The complex features of this sentence can be formularized as following :\[ K = VP- 
CAT = V\[_SF = PRED+CAT = N
SF=OBJE_SNI=PATIENT_whereby PATIENT is thc value of feature SM  . 
But we have also the following sentences where the semantic relation of object is not the patient  . There are many very interesting phenomena in Chinese language : In the sentence " ~  71"  /~ . "( the father died ) , the object " ~ ; ~"  ( father ) is the agent of the verb "~ T " ( to die )  . This structure can be formularized as following comlex feature set : 
AT = V .
F = PREDJ where by AGENT is the vaiue O\[feature SM  . 
- \[-  , 1 CAT = N  St ~" = OBJE \[_SM -- AGENT \]\[ n the sentence " lQi / ~  ) ' g " ( to cat with a big bowl )   , the object " ~@ L "' ( big bowl ) is the ~/_ . n instrument of the verb " z .   ( to eat ) This structure can tie formular iz cd as following complex feature set : 
CAT = V4-\[CAT=N
SF = PRED\]SF = OBJE
LSM=INST__whereby INST is the value of ` l'e . a turc SM . 
In the sentence "~-/"~~'-"> ~ j . .: - ( to ( mathematics ) is the scope o , e the verb "& " as following complex feature set : ~ K = : VP

TIr , whereby RESI . j _ . I is t tn e value of ' feature SM . 
.'K"-NP-!_tCAT=Ni
SF = OBJE
SM = RESULT_I
Thus we can secvery cl carly that only with the complex features the differences of these sentences can be revealed sufficiently  . 
3 . The grammatical and semantic f catures of words play an important role to put f`o > ward the rules of ` parsing  . These features can bcused as the couditions in the rules  , and basis to set up the rules for parsing of Chinese language  . I In the structure VP+NP , if the grammatical featme of VP is intransitive verb  , then the syntactic function of VP must be modifier  , and the syntactic function of NP must be head . The syntactic function of this structure VP+NP will be " modifier + head "  . Thus we can have a rule which is described with complex features as following : 
K = VP x ,! K =
TRANS=I-K=VP-~--->ICAT = V/
TRANS=IVIt!_sF = MODFJ ? IK = NP\]iL % d whereby TRANS represents he feature of trans it b ~ ty of verb  , IV represents intransitive verb , it is a value of feature TRANS . 
This rule means : In the structure VP+NP , if the value of ` TRANS d " VP is IV , then the syntactical function of VP can be given the value MODF  , and the syntactical function of NP can be given the value HEAD  .   .   .   . 
The semantic features of words can also be used to put forward the rules of ' parsing  . In the structure VP+NP , if VP is transitive verb , then we have to tLSe the semantic Features or NP to decide the valtm of  . syntactic Function of . this structure . Generally speaking , if VP is transitive verb , the semantic feature of . NP is " abstracthing " , or " title of a technical or processional post "' , then the syntactical function of . VP is modifier , and the syntactical function o2NP is head . For example , in the phrase " fill 5~/   ~1 -~~" ~ purt ~ ose of training ) tlneVPijl\[ , ~ , : ( to train ) is a transitive verb , a ~ d the semantic Feature of ' NP " i -! ~ ) " ( purpose ) is " abstracthing " , we can decide that the syntactical f'unction or " -i  . i l\[~ , ~i " ( to train ) is m~i if icr , and the syntactical function of " hi ~ J " ( purpose ) is head . In the phrase "~ f ~'; 5/~ . % " ( high trainirg teacher ) , the VP"~I '~" ( to engage in advanced studies ) is a transitive verb , the NP":g ?0~" ( teacher ) is a title of ' professional post , thus we can decide that the syntactical function of ' VP":'~  i~7"  . "( to engage in advanced studies ) is m . odi ~ ier , the sy~tactica I function of . NP " ~ Jili "' ( teacher ) is head . 
Therefore we can have two folhvoing rules for parsing :  ( 1 ) FK--vP ~\[ K :> - , , -\]
ICAT-VI+/c'm=,",/....>
LTRANS=TVLSEM=ABSJ+A--N/--> , /CT = V !
LSEM=Pk\]IRANS=I_jsF=MODF/f-K=VP- \] t  7K = NP >3 
CAT--V/+'\]CAT=N
TRANS=TVSEM = ABSFt_\[_SF=MODF ~ SF = HEAII  ) __ff=NP-1\]
JLSF = I--IE ADJ ( 2 ) IK = VP lCAT = VTRANS = T where  TV represents transitive verb  , it is a value of TRANS , ABS represents abstracthing it is a value of SEN  , PP , F represent sitle of a technical or professional post  , it is another value
SF = MODY and SF = HEAD.
With the complex features , we got good results in machine translation systems FAJRA  , (3CAT and FCAT ( see Annex ) .
