In this paper , we first experimentally investigated the factors that make extracts hard to read  . We did this by having human subjects try to revise extracts to produce more readable ones  . We then classified the factors into five , most of which are related to cohesion , after which we devised revision rnles for each factor  , and partially implemented a system that revises extracts  . 
1 Introduction
The increasing number of online texts available has resulted in automatic text summarization be com-iI  , gamajor research topic in the NLP community . 
The main approach is to extract important sentences fiom the texts  , and the main task in this approach is : that of evaluating the importance of sentences \[ MIT  ,  1999\] . This producing of extracts - that is , sets of extracted important sentences - is though to be easy  , and has therefore long been the main way that texts are summarized  . As Paice pointed out , however , computer-produced extracts tend to suffer from a ' lack of cohesion '\[ Paice  ,  1990\] . For example , the antecedents corresponding to anaphors in an extract are not always included in the extract  . This often makestile extracts hard to read . 
In the work described in this paper , we therefore developed a method for making extracts easier to read by revising them  . We first experimentally investigated the factors that make extracts hard to read  . We did this by having human subjects try to revise extracts to produce more readable ones  . We then classified the factors into five , most of which are related to cohesion \[ Halliday et al  ,  1976\] , after which we devised revision rules t breach factor  , and partially implemented a system that revises extract-s  . We then evaluated our system by comparing its revisions with those produced by human subjects and also by comparing the readability judgments of human subjects between the revised and original ex--tracts  . 
In tile following sections we briefly review related works  , describe our investigation of what make extracts hard to read  , and explain our system for revising extracts to make tl ~ emmore readable  . Finally , we describe our evaluation of the system and discuss the results of that evaluation  . 
2 Related Works
Many investigators have tried to measure the readability of texts \ [ Klare  ,  1963\] . Most of them have e--valuated wellformed texts produced by people  , and used two measures : percentage of familiar words in the texts  ( word level ) and the average length of the sentences in the texts  ( syntactic level )  . These measures , however , do not necessarily reflect the actual readability of computer-produced xtracts  . We therefore have to take into account other factors that might reduce the readability of extracts  . 
One of them could be a lack of cohesion . It all i-day and t tasan\[ttalliday et al ,   1976\] described five kinds of cohesion : reference , substitution , ellipsis , conjunction , and lexical cohesion . 
Minel\[Minel et al ,   1997\] tried to measure the readability of extracts in two ways : by counting the number of anaphors in an extract that do not have antecedents in the extract  , and by counting the number of sentences which are not included in an extract but closely connected to sentences in the extract  . 
We therefore regard kinds of cohesion as important in trying to classify tile factors that make extracts less readable in the next section  . 
One of the notable previous works dealing with ways to produce more cohesive extracts is that of Paiee\[Paiee  ,  1990\] . Math is presented a framework in which a pair of short sentences are combined into one to yield a more readable extract \[ Mathis et al  ,  197 , 3\] . We think , however , that none of the previou studies have adequately investigated the factors making extracts hard to read  . 
Some investigators have compared human-produced abstracts with the original texts and investigated how people revise texts to produce abstracts be done for  ( at least ) the following three purposes : ( 1 ) to shorten texts , (2) to change the style of texts , (3) to make texts more readable . 
Jing\[aing ,   1999\] is trying to implement a human summarization model that includes two revision operations : reduction  ( 1 ) and combination ( 3 )  . Mani \[ Mani et al ,   1999\] proposed a revision system that uses three operations : elimination  ( 1 )  , aggregation (1) , and smoothing (1 ,  3) . Mani showed that his system can make extracts more informative without degrading their read a bi lity  . The present work , however , is concerned not with improving readabili-ty but with improving the informativeness  . 
3 Less Readability of Extracts
To investigate the revision of extracts exper imental-ly  , we had 12 graduate students produce extracts of 25 newspaper articles from the NIHONKEIZAI SHINBUN  , the average length of which was 30 sentences . We then asked them to revise the extracts ( six subjects per extract )   . 
We obtained extracts containing 343 revisions , made for any of the three purposes listed in the last section  . We selected the revisions for readability , and classified them into 5 categories , by taking into account the categories of cohesion by Halliday and Hasan \ [ Halliday et al  ,  1976\] . Table 1 shows the sum of the investigation . 
Next , we illustrate each category of revisions . In the examples , darkened sentences are those that are not included in extracts  , but are shown for explanation . The serial number in the original text is also shown at the beginning of sentences aA  ) Lack of conjunctive expressions/presence o fextraneous conjunctive expressions The relation between sentences  15 and 16 is adversative , because there is a conjunctive ' L . b'\[l ( However ) ' at the beginning of sentence 16 . But because sentence 15 is not in the extract , ' Lh ' L ( However ) ' is considered unnecessary and should be deleted . Conversely , lack of conjunctive x pression-smight cause the relation between sentences to be difficult to understand  . In such a case , a suitable conjunctive expression should be added  . For these tasks , discourse structure analyzer is required . 
We use the following three tags to show revisions.
<  , , t , ~> F , ~< I , a a >: add a new expression ~ . 
<, ~ t > Bz < In , 4>: delete an expression ~..
<  ,   , I , ~ t > t % </ r , r >: replace an expression ~3 with B41 ( The company plans to give women more opportunity to work by employing fidl-time workers  . ) 15 . ~ KmJUI~TIY , h ~~, ?

B ) Syntactic complexity 2 .

(It is also the preparation for expanding the business to cellular phone  . ) Longer sentences tend to have a syntact ical ly complex structure \ [ Klare  ,  1963\] , and along compound sentence should generally be divided into two simpler sentences  . It has also been claimed , however , that short coordinate sentence should be combined \[ Mathis et al  ,  1973\] .

In such a ease , repeated expression should be omitted or replaced by pronouns  . In this example , the anaphoric expression '\[ ii J~1: ( the eo in pany ) ' is used instead of the original expression .

In such a case , there are two ways to revise : to replace the anaphoric expression with its antecedent  , or to delete the expression . There . vision in the example is the latter one . For the task , a method for anaphor and ellipsis resolution is required  .

(CEO Son < add > of Softbank <:/ add > is eager to sell softwares using CDROM  , and he think it is a big project for his company . ) In this second example , since ' CEOS on ' appears without the name of the company in the extract  , without any background knowledge , we may not u : nderstand what company Mr . Son is the CEO of . Therefore , the name of the company ' Softbank ' should be added as the supplementary information  . 
The task requires a method for information extraction or at least named entity extraction  .

But , because sentence 29 is not in the extract , the particle '- L( , too ) ' is unnecessary and should be deleted . 
4 Revision System
Our system uses the Japanese public-domain analyzers JUMAN\[Kurohashi et al  , 1998\] and KNP\[t ( urohashi ,   1998\] morphologically and syntactically analyze an original newspaper article and its extract  . It then applies revisions rules to the extract repeatedly  , with reference to the original text , until no rules can revise the extract further . 
4.1 Revision Rules
Because tile techniques needed for dealing with all the categories of revisions dealt within the previousmented revision rules only for factors  ( A )  , ( C ) , and ( D ) in Table 1 by using JP erl . 
a ) Deletion of conjunctive x pressions We prepared a list of  52 conjunctive expressions , and made it a rule to delete each of them whenever the extract does not include the sentence that expression is related  . To identify the sentence related to the sentence by the conjunction \[ Mann et al  ,  1986\] , the system performs partial discourse structure analysis taking into account all sentences within three sentences of the one containing the conjunctive x pression  . 
The implementation of our partial discourse structure analyzer was based on Fukumoto's discourse structure analyzer\[Fukumoto  ,  1990\] . It infers the relationship between two sentences by referring to the conjunctive x pressions  , topical words , and demonstrative words . 
c ) Omission of redundant expressions
If subjects ( or topical expressions marked with topical postposition ' wa '  ) of adjacent sentences in an extract were the same  , the repeated expressions were considered redundant and were deleted  . 
d-l ) Deletion of anaphors
To treat anaphor and ellipsis successfully , we would need a mechanism for anaphor and ellipsis resolution  ( finding the antecedents and omitted expressions )  . Because we have no such mechanism , we implement a rule with ad hoc heuristics : If an anaphor appears at the beginning of a sentence in an extract  , its antecedent must be in the preceding sentence . Therefore , if that sentence was not in the extract , the anaphor was deleted . 
d-2 ) Supplement of omitted subjects If a subject in a sentence in an extract is omitted  , the revision rule supplement she subject from the nearest preceding sentence whose subject is not omitted in the original text  . This rule is implemented by using heuristics imilar to the above revision rule  . 
5 Eva luat ion o f Rev is ion System We evaluated our revision system by comparing its revisions with those by human subjects  ( evaluation 1 )  , and comparing readability judgments between the revised and original extracts  ( evaluation 2 )  . 
5 . 1 Eva luat ion 1: comparing system revisions and human revis ions Because revision is a subjective task  , it was not easy to prepare an answer set of revisions to which our system's revisions could be compared  . The revisions that more subjects make , however , can be considered more reliable and more likely to be necessary  . 
When comparing the revisions made by our system with those made by human subjects  , we therefore took into account the degree of agreement among subjects  . 
For this evaluation , we used 31 newspaper articles ( NIHONKEIZ AISHIN BUN ) and their extracts . They were different from the articles used for making rules  . Fifteen of extracts are taken fronl Nomoto's work \ [ Nomoto et al  ,  1997\] , and the rest were made by our group . The average numbers of sentences in the original articles and the extracts were  25  . 2 and 5 . 1 . 
Each extract was revised by five subjects who had been instructed to revise the extracts to make them more readable and had been shown the  5 examples in section 3  . As a result , we obtained 167 revisions in total . The results are listed in Table 2 . 
Table 2: The number of revisions
I \] revision methods I total I
A add (61)/delete(ll ) conjunctive x pressions 72
B combine two sentences ( 2 ) divide a sentence into two ( 6 ) 8C pronominalize ( 5 )  ; omit expressions (3) add demonstratives (8) 16
D supplement omitted expressions ( lI ) replace anaphors by antecedents ( 10 ) delete anaphors ( 15 ) 36 add supplementary information ( 26 )  26
E delete adverbial particles ( 4 ) add adverbial particles ( 5 )   9 swer set comprising revisions that more than two subjects made  . And we used recall ( R ) and preci~sion ( P ) as measures of the system's performances . 
( Numberofsystem'srevisions ) matched to the answer
R = Number of revisions in the answer ( Number of system's revisions ) matched to the answer
P = Number of system fs revisions
Evaluation results are listed in Table 3 . As in Table 3 , the coverage of our revision rules is rather small  ( about 1/4 ) in the whole set of revisions in Table 2 . It is true that the experiment is rather small and can be considered as less reliable  . Though it is less reliable , some of the implemented rules can cover most of the necessary revisions by human subjects  . 
However , precision should be improved.

REV-1 and REV-2 were respectively extracts revised in the cases where more than one and more than two subjects agreed to revise  . 
We considered a judgment by tile majority ( more than two subjects ) to be reliable . The results are listed in Table 4 . The column ' split ' in Table 4 indicates the number of cases where no majority could agree  . The results show that both REV-1 and REV-2 extracts were more readable than NON-REV extracts and that  REV-2 extracts might be better than REV-1 extracts , since the number of ' worse ' evaluations was smaller for  REV-2 extracts . 
Table 4: Comparison of readability among original extracts and revised ones \]\] better same \] worse\] split 
REV-2 vs . NON \] 151:22
REV-1 vs . NON 2271
AUTO vs . NON\[\[213\[12\]0
In comparing REV-AUTO with NON-REV , we use 27 texts where the readability does not degrade in REV-2  , since the readability cannot improve with revisions by our system in those texts where the readability degrades even with human revisions  . Even with those texts , however , in a hnost half the cases , the readability of the revised extract was worse than that of the original extract  . The main reason is that the revision system supplement-ed incorrect subjects  . 
6 Discussion
Although the results of the evaluation are encouraging  , they also show that our system needs to be improved  . We have to impleinent in ore revision rules to enlarge the coverage of our system  . One of the most frequent revisions is to add conjunctions  ( 37% )  . 
We also need to reform our revision rules into more thorough implementation  . To improve our system , we think it is necessary to develop a robust discourse structure analyzer  , a robust mechanism for anaphora and ellipsis resolution  , and a robust system of extracting named entities . They are under develop-lllent now . 
7 Conclusion
In this paper we described our investigation of the factors that make extracts less readable than they should be  . We had human subjects revise extracts to made them more readable  , and we classified the factors into five categories  . We then devised revision rules for three of these factors and i inplemented a system that uses them to revise extracts  . We found experimentally that our revision system can improve the readability of extracts  .
