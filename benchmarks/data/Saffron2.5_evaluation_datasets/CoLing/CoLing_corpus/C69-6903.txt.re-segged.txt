We start with Chomsky's definition of the lexical entry 
as the whole of the phonological , semantic and syntactic distinctive features . This definition is interpreted matricially . The iexical entry's matrix contains semantic re ferrences to the sense and signification of the linguistic objects - the words  . 
Introducing the matrixes of the lexical entries - which are grouped in a senSence-in its  ( the sentence's ) matrix , we study vectorially the elements of the structural description  ( the Dase component and the Transformational component of the Grammar  )  . The different gra~natical and semantic categories -which determine the relations in the sentence- have different vectors  ( theoretically the vectors are of unitary dimension and are considered as free and si tuated in the same plane  ) in the system of calculus . 
In short is dealt also with the problem of referentials : but this problem is not solved exhaustively  .
