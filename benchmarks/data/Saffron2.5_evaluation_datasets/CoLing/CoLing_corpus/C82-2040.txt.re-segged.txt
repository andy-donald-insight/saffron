Databases access is typically approached as a prog~anm-ing problem rather than a user inter face problem  . Wez . conseqently see situations where only programmers can access inform-ation in data bases  , in spite of the fact that the people who need this information are typically non-pro~'a ~ners  . The most desirable way to extend database access capabilities to naive user popula tions is by means of a natural language inter -face or " frontend " system that can process requests stated in the user's natural language  . PEARL is a domaln-lndependent system for natural language an alYs is that can be customized to handle domain-specific queries to exist ing databases  . 
PEARL analyzes English input with expect at ion-driven p ~ rsing techniques end question answering strate@les developed by Artifi cial Intelligence researchers  ( Lehnert ,  /1978/  , Sohank and Riesbeck/1976/ , Riesbeok /1975/ , Gershmsn/1979/ , Birn-baum and Selfridge/1979/ , and produces code in whatever query language is currently being used to access a specific database  . PEARL can therefore be adapted to any database that has a query language access module  . 
In any realistic application of natura l language a nal-ysis  , we can expect users to make mistakes , forget to specify necessary parameters , and use words that are not in the system's vocabulary  . PEARL is designed to handle these ine-vitab leoccurrences with interactive user dia logues that -  167 -allow the user %0 augment , verify and alter the system's interpret at ion of an input request  . PEARL accepts requests in unrestricted Engl ish : no constraints are placed on the user to stay within a restricted vocabulary or artificial syntax  . 
The following examples of PEARL in action are taken from a version of PEARL that has been customized to handle requests made by geologis ts to a database conte/ning inform-ation about oil wells  . The geologists in this user population axe oil explor at lonlsts with a coess to a ? ~ ph lcs package that can generate maps on the basis of information in the database  . The map requests given be . low are highly domain-specific and there fore contain many technical terms used by oi lexplorationists  .

PEARL uses conceptually-driven techniques fo r language a na~s is which mast be customized fo r specific domains and task orientations  . To customize PEARL for a new database appli cation  , we mast conduct a thorough study of typicall ~- uage use for that application  , so that PEARL will be able to handle techn ical or idiosyncratic constructions and vocabulary items  . Once PEARL is capable of processing a real is ticspect--  169 -rum of possible language use , PEARL automatically adjusts to the expert i se of individual users  . Expert users are allowed to state their requests in as concise a manner as desired  , while in experienced users are carefully quer ied about possib-leambiguities and insufficient specifications  . This inherent flexibility is a natural by product of  a~7 competent lan6~age processing system , and a necessary featul ~ for effective and satisfylngm-~/m~ch~econznuzLtcation  ,
