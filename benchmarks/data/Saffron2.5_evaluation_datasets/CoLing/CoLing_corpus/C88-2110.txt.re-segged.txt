Abstract
In this paper wcexamine a subset of polyscmous elements  , the logical structure of nominals , and argue that maw cases of polysemy have well -defined calculi  , which interact with the grmn mar in predictable and determinate ways for disambiguation  . These calculic onstitute part of the lexicai organization of the grammar and contribute to the lexical semantics of a word  . The lexieal system of the grammar is distinct from the conceptual representation associated with alc xie alitem  , where polysemy is less constrained by grarmnar . We propose a structured'semantic representation  , the Lexical Conceptual Paradigm ( LCP ) which groups nouns into paradigmatic classes exhibiting like behavior  . 
1. Introduction
Much of the work on polysemy hastended to confuse the nature of word meaning by labeling many different types of ambiguity as the same phenomenon  . In the extreme case , every possible lexieai semantic distinction is a case of polysemy and must have its own conceptual representation  . In such a theory , various features are introduced to distinguish one sense from another ~ but the meanings m ' e all part of the same homogeneous conceptual space  . 
In this paper , we argue that there are various types of polysemy  , some more accessible to grammatical phenomena than others  . We use this as a principle distinguishing characteristic of polysemous types  . We distinguish two systems that together comprise the meaning of lexieal items  , the lexical system and the conceptual system . In particular , if there are certain grammatical character i , ~ tics that are affected by a polysenmus relation between concepts  , then we will say that this relation is overtly part of the lexical  51B Artificial Intelligence Applications Group

Brandeis University system .   1 Them Qorpoint to be argued here is that polysemy is not a  . single phenomenon operating over all lexical items with equM force and frequency  . Rather , Lhere are subsystems in the lexicon which exhibit a restricted range of polysemous behavior  . Each subsystem is determined by a representation called a Lexieal Conceptual Paradigm  ( LCP )  , which groups elements into classes with similar behavior  . We limit ourselves in this paper to cases of polysemy involving nominals  . 
We will proceed as follows . In Section Two we examine the different types of polysemous nominals  . In particular , we look at a classification of relational nouns , paying particular attention to those exhibiting polysemous behavior  . Then we examine the semantic interpretations possible for art if actual nominal such as book and record  , and their associated polysemous behaviore sulting from certain syntactic on texts  . In Section Three we introduce a framework ibr representing this information in the lexicon  . We argue that certain semantic information associated with nomina ~ is more priviliged and accessible to syntactic selection than other knowledge associated with the word  . We term these privileged properties the hidden -event roles of a nominal  , and they form part of the Lexical System of semantic analysis  . All other information forms part of the more traditional notion of a conceptual space  , what we term simply the Conceptual System . Finally , in Section Foul " we look at the computational implications of  1 We will discuss neither lexical ambiguity for verb ~ trotholnonymy  . Our poin L here is to narrowiwl on the finer sel ~antic distinctions within a smaller set of lexica \] items  . For general discussion oniauues in lexical ambiguity  , however , see/Bogura ev 1979/ , \] Hit~t1987/ , /H ~ we ~1977/ , and/Wilks1975\]' . See/St Mlard 1987/for a related approach to polyaemy . 
2 As this group of nominals has been ~ tudied extensively in the linguiBtic literature  ( cf . for example , /Anderson 1979/ , /Puatejovsky 1984/ , /Willimm ~1985/ , /Safl r 1987/ , / Moor $ gat 1985/) , we will die cuss it here only briefly , suc~halexic : dorganization . The distinction is an important one for computational reasons  . First , it establishes clear criteria for partitioning the semantic information associated with a word  ; this will be ardirectly on the decisions made by a parser in order to disambiguatelxical items during a parse  . Secondly , it affects the planning strategies necessm3r for lexicM selection in the process of language generation  . Finally , it relates to the question of how to enter multiple word senses for a lexical item  . According to this view , those words containing logical ambiguities carry these sensc  . , ~ in the same entry . 
2 . The litelational Structure of Nominals One reason to study the semantics of relational nominals is that they exhibit polysemy in very well-defined and structured ways  . For example , nominalizations such as arrival , destruction , and solution are ambiguons between the event a or niltal reading and the resultative reading  , as illustrated in (1) through (3) Y(1) a . We witnessed the city's destruction . Event b . The destruction was widespread throughout the city  . Resnltative (2) a . Mary's arriva ! is expected to beat3:00 pm . 
Event b . Mary's arrival means that she gets the couch . 
Res ~ tltative (3) a . John's solution to the problem took 20 minutes . 
Event b . This solution is too difficult to understand . Resultative It seems natural to ascribe the relational senses to nominalizations  ; ~s being some projection of their related verbal arguments i  ; ructure . There axe many nominals , however , which are oot nominalizations , yet seem to refer to relations in their meaning . Classic examples include nouns such as picture and story  , a The difference is that their relational structures are implicit  , while the relation in a nomhtalization is explicit  . 
Let us now turn to the class of dependent nominals  . If the denotation of one sense of a lexical item is " depende : ct " on another  , then that dependency is part of the semantic representation f that lexical item  . A familiar example is father or mother , where the relational nature ' must be p~xt of the semmatics of the noun  . 4 We term these Primitive relational nominals . Perhaps not as familiar are nouns such as blemish  , wart , scratch , cut , etc . In each of the sd cases , the object is evaluated with respect o another object  , and in fact it is hard to imagine the dependent object existing in isolation  . For this reason , these will be called Primitive Figure-Ground nominals  . The object itself is the figure to a necessary ground object  . 
A related class of lexical items includes nouns such as window and door  . These are not simply Primitive Figure-Ground nominals  , for notice that there is a hidden argument present hat relational nouns such as wart do not have  . 
(4) a . Plastic windows are on sale at Lechmere.
b . The cat crawled through the window.
(5) a . John painted the door blue.
b . John walked through the door quickly.
As pointed out in \] Lakoff 1987/ , as well as/Talmy 1975/ , the nouns here are polysemous , since the window referred to can be the opening as well as the object  . Thus , the hidk . 
denargument mentioned is the open space that is left as a result of the absence of the window  . We term this argument the inverted figure , and the noun class itself Double Figure-Ground Nominals  . 5 In Section Three , it will bc shown that the polysemy illustrated in  ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) is very different from word senses not making reference to either the figure or inverted figure  . 
The next class of relational nominals are those which enter into a specified relation  ; namely , the class of artifacts . 
An artifact is , by definition , an object associated with a particular activity or event  ; for example , cigarettes are for smoking , books are for reading , etc . Because of these associated activities , this class of nouns exhibit polysemous behavior . 
(6) a . This record weighs a nounce.
b . This record lasts 35 minutes.
(7) a . The book has a red cover.
b . This book will tal Ce a week ( to read).
(8) a . These cigarettes are longer thaal the normal size . 
b . His cigarette is bothering me.
3 See/Pustejovsky 1984/ , / Safir 1987/ , and/William B1985/ for further dis-cu6s lon . 
4 / Partee and Kamp 1986/discusses the semantics of such nominals . 
5 Another type of dependent omilml is that seen with ' lock ~ and ~ key '  . These objects do exi . t independent of the ground object it is associated with through its function  , but still allow selection for this dependency ; for example , " key to the lock " and "10 ck for the door " . 

The polysemy in ( 6 ) arises becmme of the possible reference to the event of playing the record as well as the record by itself  . Similarly , in ( 7 ) the book itself or the event of reading the book can be referred to by the nominal  . 
Finally , the difference in ( 8 ) points to the cigarette as an object with attributes versus an object in the context of being smoked  . ~ In this section we have presented five types of relational nominals  ( nominalizations , primitive relationals , primitive figure-grounds , double figure-grounds , and arti-factual nominals ) , showing how they exhibit subtle but productive polysemous behavior  . In the next section , we outline our approach to polysemy and preser it an explanation of these lexieal mn biguities in terms of a richer semamtic representation  . 
3 . The Theory of Lexical Organization Unlike many previous approaches to word meaning  , we distinguish the logical lexieal semantics of a word from its deeper  , conceptual denotation . tWe term these the
L-system and U-system , respectively.
The L-system is the particuhu-organization that the lexicon assumes independently of the conceptual system  . Only semantic information tlmt is somehow reflected in the syntax is represented here  . 
The C-system is the organization of the concepts themselves and not the language  . This is the structure of theme ~ mings , and as such , would be represented as a semantic network or radial category structures  ( Cf . /Hayes 1977/,/ Lakoff 1987/) . 
l ) breach of the nominal types described in the previous sections  , we give lexical representations which allow us to capture their polysemous behavior  . Consider first the Double Figure-Ground Nominals in  ( 4 ) and ( 5 )  . The lexical semantics of such nouns as window and door must refer t  , othe three arguments mentioned by the implicit relation  , the figure , ground , and inverted-figure . Assuming a first-order , partial-decomposition model of lexical semantics , as given in/Pustejovsky 1987/ , the translations for this class would be as follows:  6 It should be pointed outhere that these are not case ~ of metonymy  . In metonymy , the ability of one referring expression to stand in for another object is very uneons trained ~ and fails to conform to any strict  9ondiLiolm on flllblltitutio Iltun liketle ea ~ ea mentioned above  , rig ~ ,  . ~,( y )^~( ~, go . tl , . . . (~, y ))\] . 
where the three . -placerlation is explicitly represented as a conjunction of functions over the argmnents ~ c is a co  , _~-stant ~ Figure i is the inverted-figure , and ~ , is a metalogical operator indicating the purpose of the object being defined  ( el . /Pustejovsky in '1, reparation ~) . The important hixa5 to note about this representation is that it predicates two distinctypes of information over two different but rein  , ted arguments , x and y ; in a nely , that a door ~ for example 4 is defined in terms of both the concrete object whi  ( : his arti-Net ( the figure )  , and the space in the absence of this object ( the inverted-figure )  . Thus , differ ei it matrix predications will for e ground ifferent subexpressions in the semantics ibr the norm  . For example , in ( Sa ) , the artifact reading is selected , picking out the figure , while in (5b ) the inverted-figure is selected . 
(5) a . John painted the door blue.
b . John walked through the doo'r quickly.
We argue that these are the only two types of polysemy t br these nominals that are lexieally motivated  , and that o~her apparent eases of polysemy are . simply inferences associated with the conceptual representation f the object  . This can be seen in sentence such as (1l ) , taken from/Lakoff 1987/ . 
(11) a . The window is rotting . ( Reference to the wood ) b . The kids broke the window . ( Ii . ei brene e to the pane ) These are notre Mlypolysemous in our sense , since the argument structure of the verb selecting the nominal does not specify how the noun is to be interpreted  . That is , although both reading select for the ~ u't if act interpreta-tlon  , only inferences in the conceptual system , and not the lexieal semantics , tells us that rotting is predic~tedoft lhe wooden part of the window  , s Another importmlt aspect othere presentations in  ( 9 ) m ~ d ( 10 ) is the expression introduced by the operator ~ r . '\[' his is an exmnple of a hidden-event'role denoted by a nominal expressiom I a the case of door  , the hidd cn-evex_ , t .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .  -8--~ ; \/ ie ~ tructure of ~ he conceptual ~ ya ~ em will permit such in fvx ' cnce ~ in a nut-m  , alwet v , depending on the eyatem ' ~ colamon ~ len~e model of physics ~ xnd  agaric0  , gee , /Hobbs et al1986/ for a Lmlggeative ~ pl ) rot ~ eh to such i ~ auea . 
is go . through ( w , y ) , a pointer to a particular lexical item , its argumelg ; structure , and its selectional properties . 
The richer representations i ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) now pro-rides us ~ vith a mechanism for capturing some interesting and subtle lexical distinctions in the artifact nominal class  . 
For nouns such as record , book , and bulb , we assign the following semantics : 9 ( 12 ) record . = ~ ~ z3e\[arti/aet(x)^7r(x , play(e,z ))\] . 1? (13) book = c . , \ x3e\[artifact(x)Ar(x , read(e , w,x ))\] . 
(14) bulb ~ ~ x3e\[arti/aet(z)A~r(x , illuminate(e , z))\] . 
By explicitly referencing the event that the object is associated wiLh we can solve several puzzles  . First , notice that when the event readings of record and book are selected  , they differ in their aspectual interpretations . 
(15) a . This record lasts 35 mimttes.
b . This book takes a week ( to read).
c .* This record takes 35 minntes.
d . ? This book lasts a week.
This is certainly surprising if no reference is made to the type of egent referenced by the object  . Within the calculus of aspect outlined in /Pustejovsky  1987/  , play(z ) and read(x , y ) fall into different event-types , activity and ac . -complishment , respectively , and license different emporal predicates . So , it is not surprising that lexical semantic information is accessible to such processes in the grammar  . 
Another interesting application of the notion of hidden event  ( or h-event ) comes from evaluative predicates . 11\])' or example , consider the differences between the ( a ) and ( b ) NPs below: ( 16 ) a . avinyl record : ~ P3 x3 e\[arti/a et ( x ) Avinyl ( x ) A  ~ ( ~ , play Ce , ~))^ P ( z)\] . 
b . ~long record ) tP3 x3 e\[arti/aet(x)Ar~(x , play(e , x )) A
Ion . ~( ~)^ P ( x)\].
(17) a . an opaque bulb ~ P3 x3 e\[arti/act ( z ) Aopaque ( z ) h  ~ r ( x , illuminate ( e , z )) AP(z)\] . 
b . ~brightbulb ~ x3e\[arti/aet(~)^~r(x , illuminate ( e , x )) / ~ b ,  . igh ~( e ) ^ p(x)\] . 
In (16b ) , long is a property that only the playing of the record has  , while in (17b ) , bright is a property that only the state of illumination for bulbs has  ( el . /Jackendoff 1983/for multiple senses of lexical items )  . By adopting a semantics that makes reference to events  , just as with nom-inalization : b 12we can begin to understand how to analyze evaluative predicates  . Nmnely , in the cases above , we can distinguish the types of attribution as predication over an individual variable  , the artifact ((16a ) and (17a )) , or over an event variable , the hidden event ((165) and (175)) . 
The structures given in ( 12 ) - ( 14 ) are all examples of artifactual objects . The general abstraction for these individuals is the concept of an object made for a particular use :  , \ x3 e\[arlifaet(x ) Alr(x , ~\[e , x \])\] where c ~ is some predicate . Such a structure we will term a Lexical Conceptual Paradigm  ( LCP )  . We view these nominals as exhibiting paradigmatic behavior  ( much like the inflection alendings for verb classes  ) for the following reason : a paradigm acts as both an abstraction  , in that it defines classes , as well as a structured object , with a clustering of different behaviors . When an object is assigned to a particular paradigm  , it assumes the set of behaviors characteristic of that entire class  . So it is with such ar-ti factual nominals . There are many such subsystems in the lexicon , each with their own internM consistency represented by unique paradigms  . This idc ~ is explored in detail in/Pustejovsky and Anick  1988/  . 
4. Computational Implications of Lexical
Organization
In this section we discuss the relevance and implications of the above analysis of nominal semantics for com-putation M purposes  . We will first look at the effect that richer semantic representations have on lexical selection in the process of language generation  . Secondly , we outline how the problem of lexical disambiguation is facilitated by the use of such lexical entries in the process of analysis  . 
Imagine a linguistic generation system in the service of a fairly rich semantic knowledge base and planner  . 
Lexieal selection can be defined as the mapping from such  9 We follow/Davidson , 1980\] and the extensions in/Parsons ,   1985/for our representation of an event variable for the verb  . See/Pustejovsky 1987/ for discussion .

5 21 a knowledge base to a linguistic generation system  . Appro-priate word choice is , of course , a function of numerous factors and considerations  ( /Ward 1988/ , /Pustejovsky and Nirenburg 1987/ , /Danlos 1987/) , but , in any case , the selection process makes sense only if the incoming semantic representation provides for there to be a distinction that is later reflected as a lexical distinction  . 
Consider now an implicitly relational nominal such as cigarette  . The lexical representation for such a noun is given as  ( 18 )  . 
(18) ~ i ga ~ eue ~ ~ Je\[~tffa~t(z)A~(z , smok ~( e , w ,  ~))\] . 
One of the properties of such nominals is that they may denote the situation or event that the object is embedded within  ( in this way , it seems to stand in a metonymic relation to the event  )  . Thus , if given an underlying semantic form such as that in  ( 19 )  , the generator could produce , anmng others , the linguistic forms shown in (20) . 
(19) 3 e13 e23 z\[smoke(el , x ) A cigarette(z ) A both er(e2 , el , john )\] (20) a . The cigarette's smoking both ered John . 
b . The smoking of the cigarette both ered John.
c . The cigarette both ered John.
The interesting thing to notice here is that ( 20c ) makes use of the nominal without explicit mention of the predicates moke  . In general , such paraphrase classes as that in ( 20 ) involve the hidden event associated with an object  . Furthermore , such classes exist mainly for nominals that are artifacts and have such lexical semantic representations  . A similar decision procedure is at work in the examples in  ( 21 )  , this time in matrix object position . 
(21) a . John enjoyed the cigarette . ( h-event=s moke ) b . Mary enjoyed the book . ( h-event = read)c . Bill hated the movie .   ( h-event = watch ) For each nominal appearing as head in the object position in these examples  , there is an associated hidden even that allows for the appropriate default presupposition for just what activity was enjoyed for each object  . Thus , it is clear how the representation here provides for choice points in the process of lexical selection  . 
As an indication of how lexical disambiguation can be facilitated with the richer nominal representations presented here  , consider the multiple uses of a polysemous noun such as lisp  , illustrated in (22) . 
522 (22) a . John is running lisp.
b . Mary has entered lisp.
c . John knows lisp well.
d . Mary is writing lisp.
Now , it might be argued that these senses are all slight variants of one central sense for the nominal  , perhaps that of lisp as a language . Yet what we know about lisp that makes it different from another language  , say FORTRAN , is that it is an environment as well as a language  . We can think of the preference rules in/Bogura ev ' s  1979/lex-ical disambiguation system as being elements of strnctured packets  , where the above senses are all logically related in one lexical representation fl is p  ; that is , its Lexical Con . 
ceptual Paradigm . These word senses compete as a group with other unrelated meanings  . Then , finer discrimina-tions are acl fieved by reference to the internal structure of the LCP for that word  . We explore such a technique in/Pustejovsky and Anick  1988/and compare our approach to/Hirst 1987/and other lexical disambiguation systems . 
5. Conclusion and Future Research
In this paper we have argued agains the treatment of polysemy as a relation between meanings in a homogeneous concept space  . Rather , we argue , that tbrnominals at least , there are well-defined subsystems of logically structured ambiguities arising from determinate and finite sources  . We suggest that the incorporation of hidden events in the lexical entry of a nominal provides a handle for linking to other grammatical systems uch as aspect mad thematic roles  , as well as exposing the behavior of other relationships  , uch as figure-ground , which also have grammatical reflexes . The utility of such a representation in NLU systems is illustrated by the applications to such tasks as lexical selection in natur M language generation as well as to word sense disambiguation tasks and applications in machine translation  . For example ~ we are examining the subtle range of grammaticalizations ivolved in German nominalization patterns using an eventbased semantics  ; i . e . assessing the appropriateness of one nominal expression over another  . Finally , it is interesting to speculate on what the relationship between LCP-theory and acquisition and metaphor is  . We are exploring this incurrent extensions to this work  .
