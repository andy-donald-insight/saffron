Interdigitation entails more requirements for the lexicon which defines feasible lexical representations and relates them to underlying morphemes  . .The task for the lexicon component is more or less universal  , even if some languages can do with simpler lexicons while others require more sophisticated structures  . 
This paper discusses a solution which involves using two separate lexicons  , one for word roots , and the other for prefixes , flexional elements and suffixes . Entries for roots leave flex lonal elements unspecified and vice versa  . The intersection of these two lexicons effectively defines lexical representations of word forms  . 
2. Morphotactic structure of wordforms.
Akkadian verbs have the following overall pattern :\[ pers  . \]\[ root&flection\]\[gender&numb . \]\[ opt . subjunctive etc . \]\[ opt . obj . \] An example of a fullfledged verbal form would be '  ( that ) they caught him ': lexical representation : I XtaBAT-u\-nI-shusurface representation : ix x abtuun is huA dash '-' denotes morpheme boundary  , and back slash'Vamor phophoneme for vowel lengthening  . The above word form is divided into its parts according to the pattern as follows : person  1 root X . . . B . . . AT flection . . . ta .   .   .   .   .   . 
gender & number u\subjunctiven 1 objects huCapital letters are used in order to distinguish radical consonants and vowels fi'om segments in other morphs  . 
Thus , the root & flection part is X ta BAT where capital letters are components of the root  , with lowercase letters representing flectional elements  . 
Nouns , in turn , have an overall structure : \[ stem\]\[case & number\[\[opt  . possessive \] An example of a maximal nominal wordform is their kings ~  . 
lexical representation : ShaR\-a\nt- shunU surface representation : sharraan is hunustem ShaIt\case & number a\ni possessives it unu  3  . Overall structure of morphs Verbal roots have an overall pattern of three radical consonants and one vowel c  . . . C . . . vc where flectional elements may occur in the two intervening slots marked with "  . . . " Flectional elements have a pattern consisting of two parts to fill the corresponding two gaps in the verbal root  . 
The overall pattern is roughly . . . ((( c)C)v ) . . . ( vor\) . . . 
There is at most one verbal prefix and it indicates person  ( and partly modus )  . Its overall l pattern is ( C ) y . 
There are at most three verbal suffixes attached to the stem  . The first suffix indicates gender and number ( and partly person )  . They have the form v\or they are empty . 
The second suffix indicates either the subjunctive  ( u , empty , or n-l ) or the ventive ( amoraim ) . The third suffix denotes the object or the dative case and conforms to a pattern cv  ( cu ( \ cv ) ) Nominal stems are given as derived complete stems containing three radical consonants which can be identified  , but no attempt has been made to generate them from plain radical consonants and flectional elements because stems are idiosyncratic and better described as lexicalized whole units  . 
Nominal suffixes indicate gender , number and case . 
Gender is part of the stem for nouns whereas adjectives have an explicit feminine suffix  ( a ) t ( the masculine has no marking )  . Number and case are represented by port-manteau morphs  . After the seendings there may be a possessive nding according to one of two patterns : vk or c v  ( cv )  . 
3. Phonological Description
Akkadian , like many other Semitic languages , has a considerable number of phonological and morphophonological processes  . This paper describes a fairly complete and tested system of some  30 rules written in two-level formalism and compiled with the TWOL rule compiler \[ Karttunen  , Koskenniemi and Kaplan ,  1987\] . A number of examples is given below accompanied by rules that correspond to the processes  . In each example the lexical representation is given  ( in boldface ) above the surface representation ( in normal face )  . 
There are several assimilations word internally and at morpheme boundaries  , eg . an N in the root is assimilated to the immediately following consonant  , eg . 7 recut(past tense ) ':
I~KI Sikk is which corresponds to the rule : " assimilation of N " 
N : F <=>: F ; where F in Consonants;

U ... aatl , .. ouo , ..
p erson3 plural feminine person3 plural masculine person1 singular masculine , or person3 singular masculine The combinatorics of Akkadian prefixes and suffixes seems to be fairly complicated  , but a feature calculus seems to be sutIicient for handling it so that it lets only valid combinations through and gives correct morphosyntactic features to word forms  .
