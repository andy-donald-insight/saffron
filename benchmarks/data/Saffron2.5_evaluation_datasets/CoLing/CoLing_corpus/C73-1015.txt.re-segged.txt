TO WARDS A PHONOLOGICAL ALGORITHM
The ultimate goal of phonology is to uncover the mechanism 
whereby an indiscrete succession of sounds becomes a discrete chain 
of identifiable phonemes . A wordfalls naturally into morphemes and syllables  . In the course of this double division two classes of languages emerge : those in which syllable - and morpheme-boundaries always coincide and those in which this correspondence is not obligatory  . 
In the first case the minimal unit of segmentation is the syllable  . In the second case we meet with such examples as domus in Latin  , reading in English , and so on . Syllabically they are do-mus , reading , morphologically dora-us , reading ; the combined scheme is do-m-us , rea-d-ing . 
At the initial stage of processing the sound chain we are only able to discriminate between syllabic and phonemic languages  , for/In/indomus and / d/in reading are phonemes  , i . e . the smallest units of natural segmentation in on -syllabic languages  . This is the most primitive and heuristically the earliest definition of a phoneme that a linguist can give  . We will formulate the first instructions to the phonologist thus :  ( I ) Take any bimor phemic word ( with a sufft x or ending )  , divide it into syllables and by examining the points of morpheme - and syllable-division state the presence  ( resp . absence ) of phonemes in the language . 
.In this paper we shall concern ourselves with phonemic languages  . 
The main spring of further analysis is neutralization and related phenomena  . Let us take the Russian form\[goT\] . This form is ambiguous and resolves itself into two different roots : god -" year " and got -" Goth "  . The fact that \[ goT\] is the phonetic integument of only two forms proves that the distinction between god - and got-lies in one segment  ; if they had two different segments , the form under consi-deration would halve resolved itself into at least four roots  ( n differences give 2-~ or sometimes 2~+1 forms ) : cp . the invented place name\[s'tki \] ( \[-\] designates a reduced pretonic vowel )  , which may equally 196^ . s . LIBER MAN well represent Sodki , Sadki , Sotki , and Satki and thereby demonstrates that sad-and sot-have two points of distinction  . Having found out that god - and got-constitute a minimal pair  , we must localize the difference between them . 
The forms of the Genitive case of the two words are  g6da and g6ta : syllabically go-da , go-ta , morphologically god-a , got-a . We cannot know how many phonemes there are in the syllable go-  ; neither do we know whether the case inflexion is monophonemic  . But we may be sure that the stem-final elements of god a  , got a are monophone mic(go-d-a , go-t-a as do-m-us , rea-d-ing ) . We have not learn to compare phonemes , but we can compare go-of go-da , and go-ofgo-ta . The existence of the syllables go-1 and go-z proves that they are able to function as independent words : otherwise their separation from the second syllables would have been impossible  ( cp . the English latter-ladder ) . But if they are words ( actual or virtual : as a matter of fact ~ go/does not exist in Russian but/no /  , /po\] , / to / , / do / , etc . exist ), we can test their identity . If they prove to be homonyms , the difference between goda and got a is concentrated in \] d /-\] t /  ; if they are non-homonyms , the difference lies to the left of / d /- It / , viz . in the vowels . 1Go-1 ( from go-da ) and go-2 ( from go-ta ) are homonyms , and it follows that/d\]and/t/are indeed different phonemes  . The difference between them thus stated is the most abstract manifestation of a distinctive feature  . 
So far it has nothing to do with phonetics ; it is " a something " which keeps/d/and/t\[ apart  . 
We have detecte different phonemes in go-d-a , go-t-a , but we do not yet know the status of the stem -final consonant in\[goT\]  . A chain of simple arguments will convince us that this element is not a phoneme of the same rank as /d/or It /  . Following the row god a , godu , go dom , ( o ) gode ( different oblique cases of god-o ) , we observe that the root is everywhere quite unambiguous  . Only in the Nominative case we suddenly acquire a new meaning :\[ goT\]is both god-O and got-O  . A new meaning could not haves prungup , if one and the same phoneme went on alternating ; consequently , the stem-final phonemes of goda-go du-go dom-gode and god-O cannot be identical  . On the other hand , the root of gota-go tu-go tom-gote is again unambiguous  , 1 Not in the prevocalic part . for the opposition got-kot ~ he-cat J could not ' have possibly been neutralized : all events in Russian inflexion happen at the end of the word  . 
Also note the importance of the open syllable ingo -da  , go-ta : in a dosed syllable we could suspect that the difference is covered by the first post -vocalic onsonants  , 
TO WARDS A PHONOLOGICAL ALGORITHM 197 and only in got-O we meet with an unexpected new meaning  ( not only got-O but also go d-o )  . So here too the stem-final consonant of got a -gotu  , etc . is not the same as that of got-O . The conclusion is ineluc-table that IT\]in\[ goT \] does not belong either to/d/or/t/  . It is functionally a very weak element , and whatever its physical properties , it is unable to differentiate the morphemes which are distinct in all other situations  . In\[goT\]both / d/and/t/must have lost the feature which otherwise prevents them from merging  , and only the non-distinctive part must have remained  . 
The phenomenon analyzed above is alone worthy to be called neutralization  . To make sure of it let uses a mine the rootro ; f- . This is also an ambiguous root , for we have rog-O " horn "- ro : ~ ek " little horns "  ( Gen . , P1 . ) and ro ~ . -a " mug " ( or simply ro ~'- O " rye ") . A comparison of /~/ and/g/will give us a distinctive feature just as the comparison of / d / and / t/ingod-O  , got-O . But the ambiguity is present in all the cases of the word rosa  ( ro : ~ a , ro~i , ro : ~ e , ro~ei , etc . ):/~/does not crop up as a result of phonological weakening and is therefore a separate phoneme  , as / g/ . Graphically we may represent the two situations in the following way : / a / / t /  ( a phoneme )   ( a phoneme ) od a godugo dom ( o ) gode/T / ( an archiphoneme ) / g / ( a phoneme )   ( a phoneme ) got a to gagoturogugo tomrogom ( o ) gote ( o ) rogerosaro ; ~i () " 0 l ' o zero ; ~ek Our next instructions to the phonologist will be such :  ( II ) Examine all the monosyllabic roots of the language  . Select those which are phonetically ambiguous and can be understood as the roots of two different words  . Take these words and change them into dissyllabics  . Find the point of syllable division in both and ascertain whether the first syllables in them are open  . Only words with initial open syllables will easily lend themselves to preliminary analysis  . 
Compare the lefthand open syllables : if they may be represented as different words  , the roots under consideration have different vowels  ;  198 ^ . s . UB ~ a ~ A ~ if the open syllables may be represented as homonyms  , the difference lies in the post vocalic onsonants . The opposition of the contrasting phonemes will yield the linguistic basis of the distinctive feature that keeps them apart  . Study all the possible oppositions and get al the distinctive features obtainable by this method  . The features will be only loosely characterized , e . g . " that which distinguishes the root-final consonant of such-and-such words and disappears before a pause " The element of the ambiguous form is not an independent phoneme if its occurrence is confined to this form  . But if some root is ambiguous in all its forms and another oot only in one form  , we have a case of two independent phonemes crossing at a single point  , so that the phonological make up of the constantly ambiguous root remains unchanged  . 
When all the distinctive features have been extracted in this way  , some phonemes will have become uniquely characterized as bundles of distinctive fatures  .   ( It is important that at this stage a phoneme can be defined both as a minimal unit of natural segmentation ad as a bundle of distinctive features  , i . e . not only syntagmatically but also paradigmatically  )  . But even these phonemes will be tied to the stem -final position  . We must now learn to recognize these phonemes in other contexts  , e . g . to identify/d/ingo cla and/d/indom " house " as one and the same unit  . This is the most difficult step , and nothing but a tentative solution can be proposed here  . It seems that phonemes are discovered as purely linguistic entities but identified phonetically  . 
After we have obtained the features of the type " that which distinguish-es etc  .  "  ( see above ) we must fred their physical correlates and use them as tools of further identification  . Human langmage consists of sounds , and it could be expected that at some late moment the material implementation f phonemes would come in  . 
Our next instruction scoristitute a programme , which has already taken decades to carry out and whose termination lies in a comparatively distant future  . 
(III ) Select the phonemes uniquely characterized as bundles of distinctive features and find their physical correlates  . Use the correlates as marks whereby to recognize the phonemes in all contexts  . 
The Russian phonemes/dtg 2 / and some others are uniquely characterized by their distinctive fatures  . But there are phonemes entering into few or no alternations  . Thus , IbI and Iv/never alternate in l~us-sian , ' ~ and so the specific feature that keeps them apart defies detection  . 
To be sure , while studying \[ dtg 21 etc . , we got a list of distinctive
TO WARDS A PHONOLOGICAL ALGORITHM 199 features and later found their correlates . Therefore we can now choose some features from the generalist and ascribe them to/b/and/v /   ( e . g . /b / will be a stop and/v/aspirant ) , but the arbitrariness of this procedure is apparent  . 
Every system of phonemes , if diagrammed , will consist of concen-tric circles . The nucleus contains phonemes o active that their behaviour is able to characterize them uniquely  . Some phonemes are less active ( e . g . / b/and/v\[inRussian ) , others are ( almost ) non-characte-rizable at all ( e . g . /1 mnr /) ; in the outermost circle we shall find the English /h / and kindred phonemes : these do not enter into any alternations and cannot be described by distinctive features  . Phonemes may for masy stem or a list . Only the nucleus , definable through relevant features , deserves the name of system . Peripheral phonemes are juxtaposed as letters in an alphabet  ; they are also kept apart but their correlates must have an especially wide range of realizations  . 
Our next procedure resembles the previous one : ( IV ) Selec the phonemes whose characteristics only pardy emerge from the alternations and those which are non-definable through their linguistic behaviour  . Contrary to the nuclear phonemes , these must be studied as wholes , both by the linguist and by the instrumentalist . 
A phoneme non-analyzable into distinctive features i itself a materialized feature  . 
After we have identified the phonemes in all contexts each of them comes out as the invariant of some class of sounds  . Hence the final definition of a phoneme : it is a minimal unit of natural segmentation in non -syllabic languages  , a bundle of distinctive features , and the invariant of sounds possessing identical features  . 
The implications of the analysi suggested above are too far-rea-ching to be discussed herein detail  . So only the most important of them will be enumerated  . 
1 ) Phonological research presupposes a certain amount of prosodic  , morphological , and semantic data ; we cannot start unless we know how to divide words into syllables and morphemes and how to distinguish omonymous forms and roots from non -homonymous ones  . 
2 ) To discover phonemes means to find their syntagmatic boundaries and to arrange them into a system  . No paradigmatic procedures or procedures of identification are possible until the phonemes are separated from their neighbours  . 
200A . s . I~IB ~ RMAI q3 ) Preliminary segmentation adidentification concern stem-final consonants  . Later they are used as " yard sticks " to define and identify stem-initial consonants  . Thus , the syntagmatic procedure comes first ; then follows the paradigmatic dentification of phonemes at the end of the stem  , and only after that the whole string falls into discrete le-ments  . Until the last step is made , phonology is divorced from phonetics ( except what concerns syllable-division ) and is a shadow of morphology . 
4) Phonemes for meither systems or lists , according as the language is rich or poor in inftexion  . 
5 ) A phonologicallg or ithm starts with the function and ends up with realizations  . It rejects the idea that phonology is functional phonetics and operates on the assumption that phonetics i instrumental phonology  . 
It is our hope that the procedures discussed in this paper can  , in principle , serve the basis of an algorithm by which a chain of phonemes is generated from an indiscrete sound string  . Once this algorithm becomes a reality , its programming will be almost a technical problem  ; we shall be able to construct an analogue of the actual speech mechanism and approach coveted goal  , viz . automatic treatment of phonic substance .
