volved , and the qualia structure provides the basis for performing type coercion in a generative  , way . 
We address here , the treatment of metonymie expressions from a knowledge representation per-spe  ( : tive , in the context of the MENF , I , A Smedical text understanding syste , m ( Zweigenbaum et al . , 1995) . One of the goals of the overall system is to assign stan  ( tar ( lised , medi ( : alnomenclature codes to the input texts ( patient discharge summaries )  . Semantic analysis st ~ rts from a syntactic representation feach sentence and produces a conceptual representation  . It is then used by sev-e , rall anguage-independent , kowledge-based components to perform inferences ( pragmatic enrich-nlell t ) and then code assignment ( Delamarr et al . , 1!)95) . Therefore , , the , conceptual representation outtmt by the semantic analysernms t be normalised : it must  ( ' on form to a knowledge representation canon in which the target nomenclature  ( : odes can lien lal ) ped . ' l ' hesi ) eciiication of this can on relies on the description of a rich model of the domain in a knowledge representation formalism  , here Conceptual Graphs ( CG ) ( Sowa ,  1984) . 
We focus in this patter on the part of the semantic analyser that deals with semantic  ( ' ore-position . The conceptual reI ) resentation built must be abstracted from initial linguistic variation  , metonymy being a typical problem to be addressed . Weext ) lain how we use the domain mo ( lel to handle metonymy , and more generally , to underlie semantic omposition , using the knowledge descriptions attached to each concept of our ontology as a kind of concept -level  , multiple-role qualia structure . The methods described have been implemented and applied to French texts  . 
We first recall the problem addressed ( section 2) . Then , the pr ( )posed method is described ( section 3 ) and illustrated on an example . We give some information on the imt ) lementation ad the results of the analyser ( section 4 )  , and discuss tit ( , ' relatiw ' , merits of the method ( section 5) . 
2 Metonymy and type coercion
A (: lassical exain ple of metonynly ( Pustejovsky ,  1 . 991, It . 428 ff ) is where predicate'began'expects an event as its second argument  , so that some way must be found to relate the object ' novel ' to an event such as ' to read a novel ' or ' to write a novel '  . In our domain ( coronary diseases ) , one often finds expressions such as ( 2 ) uneangio plastied u segment II ( an angio-plasty of segment II )   ( 3 ) une angio plastied ' uneart brecor on aire ( an angioplasty of a coronary artery )   ( 4 ) l ' angio plastie de Monsieur X ( the angioplasty of MrX )   ( 5 ) uneangio plastie de last 6 nose ( an angioplasty of the stenosis ) where ' angioplasty ' is an action performed on a segment of an artery to enlarge its diameter  , while ' stenosis ' is the state of an artery which has a reduced diameter  . These four phrases involve the object ( or " theme " ) of action ' angioplasty ' , i . e . , what the angiop last y operates upon . If one considers that this theme must be a physical object  , then examples ( 2 ) - ( 4 ) conform to the selectional restrictions of ' angioplasty '  , while (5) violates them . The mechanism of type coercion ( Pustejovsky ,  1991 ) consists in converting a word type into another so that semantic omposition can work properly  . (5) is then handled as a metonymy , where the stenosis and the stenosed object enter a state/thing alternation : ' stenosis ' is turned into an ' object '  . 
However , it appears that this phenomenon is dependent on the underlying types  ( or " sorts " ) under consideration . For instance in our ontology , ' segment ' , ' artery ' , ' stenosis ' and ' human'have four different ypes  , and are not comparable by the ISA relation , e . g . nothing can be both a segment and an artery This is a voluntary  , methodological choice ( Bouaud et al ,  1995) , motivated by the fact that these objects give rise to different inferences and must not be confused by the reasoning component  . Additionally , in the target normalised conceptual representation  , what constitutes the specific theme ( in our conceptual model , the purported_oh j ) of action ' angioplasty ' must be precisely defined  . In the context of our application , ' angioplasty'acts on an artery_segment , a physical object corresponding to a part of an artery  , which happens not to be comparable to any of the four preceding themes of ' angioplasty '  . 2 Therefore , all four examples ( 2 ) - ( 5 ) must be considered as metonymies . 
1 Segment , in our ontology , corresponds to a portion of space , not of matter . 
2 Notice , though , that these types are strongly linked ( by relations other than ISA ) through the knowledge base models . The semantic analyser precisely recovers these links thanks to the mechanism presented in this paper  . 
To handle metonymy , Fass ( 1988 ) proposes a method based on a list of alternations implemented as specific metonymy rules : Part_for -_Whole  , Container-for_Contents , etc . Sowa ( 1992 ) considers metonymies around the term " Prix Gon - court "  , originally introduced by Kayser ( 1988 ) : this term undergoes different meaning shifts in each of seven example sentences  , ranging from the author who won the prize to the amount of money received  . So wa discusses how background knowledge could help to process these metonymies  , based on a knowledge description of what " Prix
Goncourt " involves.
In our system , the target conceptual representation is defined by a domain model expressed with CGs  . This same model constitutes the resource which enables the analyser to handle metonymies  . 
We explain below how results similar to Puste -jov sky's type coercion may be obtained with a method based on this domain model instead of a qualia structure  . 
3 Method 3.1 Rationale
The input to the semantic analyser is the syntactic representation fa sentence produced by a previous large coverage syntactic analyser  ( B ~ rard-Dugourd et al ,  1989) . This representation connects words , or predicates , with grammatical relations such as subject , object , oblique object , modifier , etc . The output of the semantic analyser is a conceptual graph on which pragmatic inferences are performed to enrich the representation  . 
In the semantic lexicon , each wordpoints to one or more conceptual representations  . The grammatical in k between two words in a sentence x-presses a conceptual link between their two associated conceptual counterparts  . The task of the semantic analyser is to identify this conceptual link  . 
Rather than including the knowledge needed for this task in the semantic lexicon  , or in a specific rule base , the program will examine the domain knowledge to resolve the link  . The method relies on a heuristic path search algorithm that exploits the graphic aspects of the conceptual graphs formalism  . 
3.2 Domain knowledge
The main domain knowledg elements consist of the domain ontology  ( Fig .  1 ) which is a subsumption hierarchy of conceptypes ( henceforth simply ' types ' ) and of relation types , and of a set of reference models attached to the main types  . 
The reference model of a type represents knowledge about this type as a conceptual graph  ( Fig .  2) . Basically , a conceptual graph is a bipartite graph with concept nodes  ( or concepts ) labeled with a type plus an optional referent , and relation nodes labeled with relation types ( Chein and Mugnier ,  1992) . A model of a given type has

an identified head concept with the same type , and the network of its related concepts represents its associated knowledge  . Since types are organised in an ISA hierarchy , this knowledge is also inherited .

3, 3 Semantic lexicon
The semantic analyser relies on a twotier semantic lexicon : one for predicates  , the other for grammatical relations . Predicates map to conceptual graphs ; most of them are reduced to one concept , since most of the words in the lexicon are technical terms for which a type exists  . Figure 3 reports some lexical entries . 
It is difficult to map grammatical relations to static  , predefined conceptual representations , since their meaning in the domain depends on their context of use  , and mostly on the predicates they link . Besides , one cannot think of envisioning all the possible uses of such a relation  , partly because of the use of metonymy . The conceptual representation fanactual grammatical link will therefore be computed ynamically by the semantic analyser using its context : the linked predicates and domain knowledge  . However , each grammatical relation may have conceptual preferences for types or for conceptual relations  . These preferences are associated with the grammatical relation  . Our grammatical relations include oblique complements  , so that prepositions in our semantic lexicon are expressed under this second paradigm  ( Fig .  3) .

3.4 Algorithm
Given an input triple predicate , grammatical relation , predicate ( P1; Gr;P'2) , the semantic analyser first replaces the two predicates with their semantic entries -- two conceptual graphs  . It the nen-deavours to link them , that is , to find a concept-level relation between their two head concepts  C1 and C2 that , first , is compatible with the semantic preferences of grammatic M relation Gr  , and , second , conforms to the representational cnonmade of the reference models  . 
3.4.1 Design principle.
The basic idea is to project he two head concepts onto the domain knowledge and find a plausible concept-level relation between the two  . 
We implement his by heuristic graph traversal through the reference models and the type hierarchy  , looking for a chain made of concepts and conceptual relations  ( i . e . a linear conceptual graph ) , which could link concepts of the same types as C1 and C2 and at the same time would satisfy the conceptual preferences of Gr  . Semantic analysis then consists in solving recursively every grammatical link starting from the sentence head predicate and then joining the obtained conceptual chains to build the conceptual representation f the whole sentence  . We focus here only on the link resolution algorithm  . 
3.4.2 Chain production methods.
We consider that each predicate Pi is associated with the head concept Ci of a model Mi  . Let T i be the type of C i . We also assume a partial order i ) roducing the set of all possible chains between Cl and  C2  . Wc can use three methods of increasing complexity to find chains to link  C1 and C2:   1  . Concept fllsion : the two concepts may be redundant  . 
If T1 < T2 or Tl > T2 , then C , and 6'2 could be merged , and an empty chain is returned . 
2 . Concept inclusion : a concept may be " included " in the other's model  . 
( a ) For every concept C ' of type T ' ill M1 such that T ' > T2  , every path between
Cl and C ' in Mt is a returned chain.
( b ) For every concept C ' of type T ' in 3/& such that T ' >_T t ,  ( ; very path in Mu between C ' and C9 is a returned chain . 
3 . Model join : two arbitrary concepts in the two could be joined  . 
For every pair of concepts ( C\[ , C ~) where C ~ of type T " is in Mi , and such that T\[<T . ~ or T\[>T . ~ , all the paths Paths l between C1 and C ~ in M , and Paths . 2 between C ~ and 6'2 in \]1/\[2 are produced . Then , for every pair ( Pt , P'2) in Paths1xPaths2 , the chain made of the two paths where last ( p , ) is joined to first ( p . e ) is returned . 
At this point , we are provided with all chains extracted from the pair of models  ( MI , Me ) . 
3.4.3 Model identification.
The models that associate knowledge to a given predicate P can be ranked according to their level of generality  . The most specific model is the predicate definition in the semantic lexicon  . The next one is the reference model associated with the type T of the head concept of the definition  . Then , the following models are the reference models inherited along the ontology through supertypes of T  . 
As the type hierarchy is , in our system , a tree ( Bouaud et al ,  1995) , the models for a predicate are strictly ordered . Considering two grammatically linked predicates , the product of their models constitutes as many model pairs that can be potentially used to look for possible chains  . Such pairs are structured by a partial order based on the generality rank of their members  , a3 . 4 . 4 Heuristic chain selection . 
At this stage , we are provided with all the pos-sibles chains between  P1 and P2 extracted from their models . The remaining problemix to choose tile most appropriate chain to substitute for Gr  . 
After some experimentation , we chose the following scheme . The best chain ix selected according to five heuristic criteria :  ( 1 ) satisfiability of a A model pair ( To .  1 , rn2) is more specific than ( rn\[ , rn ~) if max_rank(ml , m . ~) is less than max_rank(m ~ , rn ~) , or if equal , rain_rank(m1 , re . e ) is less than min_rank(m ~, m'2) . 
Gr preferences ; (2) most specific , node l pair , i . e . , the use of most specific knowledge associated with words is prefered  ; (3) simplest chain production method ( see 3 . 4 . 2) ;   ( 4 ) most specific or highest priority of Gr preferences  ; (5) shorter chain length . When in ultiple chains remain in competition , one is selected randomly . 
To reduce search , tile link resolntion strategy does not consider all possible chains  , and implements the first ; two criteria directly in the chain production step  . Chains that violate Gr preferences are discarded , and model pairs are explored starting fi'om the most specific pair  . 
3.5 An example
Let us illustrate the , resolution on example ( 2 )   ( an angioplasty of segment II )  . Tile in imt triple is ( angio plastie_f ; de_f ; segment_iI_f ) . The corresponding types , Angioplasty and Segment_II , are not compatible and tile " fusion " i nethod fails  . 
The " inclusion " method also fails since no model for angio plastie_f includes a concept compatible with Segment_II  , and no model for segment_ii_f includes a concept compatible with Angioplasty  . 
However , with the " join " method , the algorithm identifies 6063 possible chains that satisfy the preferences attached to preposition des  ( Fig .  3) . 
The selected chain uses the reference model of Angioplasty  ( Fig .  2 ) and tile definition graph for segment/I_f ( Fig . 3) which are connected on concept trtery ~ qegment . The resulting conceptual representation . joins the two corresponding paths :\[ Angioplasty\]-*  ( purported-obj ) -+\[ Artcry_Segment \] . 
\ [ artery_Segment ~ - - ( zone_of ) ~--\[ Spatial_Objcct\]~ ( spatial_role ) -*\[ Segment AI\] , into\[Angioplasty\]-~ ( purported-obj ) - ~\ [ Artcry_Segment1 ~- ( zone_of ) ~-\[ Spatial_Object\]-+ ( spatial_role ) -- ~\[ Segment_II \] . 
This representation reflects the fact that in the context of an ' angioplasty '  , ' segment II ' is considered from the point of view of the physical artery segment the angioplasty is to act upon  ( instead of the spatial notion Segment_II expresses  )  . 
4 Implementation and results
This analyser has been implemented on top of a conceptual graph processing packag embedded in Common Lisp  . In the current state , the ontology contains about 1 , 800 types and 300 relation types ; over 500 types have their own reference model ; the lexicon defines over 1 , 0 00 predicates and about 150 grammatical relations and prepositions . The analyser correctly handles typical expressions found in our texts  , including examples (2)-(5) ( see table 1) . The complete processing chain has been tested on a set of  37 discharge summaries ( 393 sentences ,  5 , 715 words ) ( Zweigenbaumet ~1 . , 1995) . This corpus included development texts , so the results are somewhat opti- ( # ) phrase total chains method models partial chains selected  ( 2 ) ' angiot ) last y of segmen l , H'6063 join Angiol ) lasty\[Ailgioplasty\]~ ( imrl ) orted_ohj )  -  , \[Atery ~% ( ~ gnmnt\]\[Artery_Segment\]~ ( zone_of )  , -\[Spatial_ ( )l ) ject\]--+ ( slmtial J ' ole ) - ~\[ Segment J1\]'segme . ntII'definition- ( 3 ) ' angiophtsty of a coronary artery ' 2387 inclusion Angiol ) lasty\[Angiol ) last y\]-+ ( purlmrted x ) l ) j ) -+\[ Art ( n ' y ~ eg .   .   .   .   .   .   . t\]~-(pal't ) ~ . \[Coronary_Artery\]--- ( 4 ) ' angioplasty of MrX ' 3633 inchlsion Angioplasty\[Angiophtstyl- , (p , ,rported ml , j ) - ~\ [ Artery 2 qegme , ~t\]~- ( part ) + --\ [ lluman Ateingl ( 5  ) ' angioi ) last y of a stenosis ' 2217\[Angiot ) last y\]-~ ( purported . ohj ) *\ [ hrtery ~ Seg . . . . . . t \]~ -( i .   .   .   .

The test consisted in code a . ssignlne , t ~ t and answering a fix (' . (\[ questionnaire , the gold standard being given by health ( : are professionals . Overall recall and precision were measured at /1:8 % and 63 % on the ( : o ( ling task , and 66% and 77% on the questionnaire task . 
No ewfluation has been performed on 1here basic components of the system ; we can however provide statistics drawn from the global test for the semantic analyser  . For 274 sentences received , the link resolution procedure was called on 8 , 749 grammatical links and exI/lored247 , 877 chains , with an average of 28 chains per call and 904 per sentence . The numbea " of paths found depends heavily on the richness of the l nodels used  , which varies with the types involved , l % r instance , the model for type angioplasty ( involved in table 1 ) is central in the domain . It is the most e o inplex in the knowledge base and  ( : ontain 854 ( : one et ) ts and 78 relations , which at : counts fl ) r the , greater number of paths found in these examples . 
I lowever , in adequate xpai ~ sion 8 are , SOlnetilnes made due to lack of l node ls , or to their complexity , which makes the heuristic principles not selective enough  . Such limitations also stem froin a lack of " actual " selnantic knowledge  .

5 Discussion ( ) II Ceouhl(;omtm . reth is approach to a concel)t-based , multi-role qualia structure . The semantic definition of ~ t word is here the reference model of its head conceptype  ; each relation path starting fi'om the heade on ( : ept of this reference model is similar to a qualia role  , in that ; it ; describes one of the semantic facets or 1 ) ossible uses of the word . 
In the context of a predicate , one of the concepts in the reference model is selected as the in coln-ing point of a link from the predicate'sineal fing represent at k  ) n , The cone el ) t-oriente , ddom Mmn lode lapl ) roae had vocated here hyI ) othesizes that the behaviour of words is driven by their concept u Mroes in the domain  . This has the advantage of factoring knowledge at the conceptual level  , rather than having to distribute it at the level of words  . This knowledge can then be shared by sever M words  . Sharing even o(:(: ursacross languages ( e .  9 . Dutch ( Spyns and Willems , 1995)) . 
Moreover , the type hierarchy Mlows concepts , hence words , to inherit reference models from more M ) stract ( : olmepts , thus enabling more sitar-ing mM modularity . The distinction between local information aim information inherited through the hierarchy in filrthermor exploited when ranking different chains between two conceptypes  . 
Another differelmeresi ( tesin the way flexibility is obtained , in \] hlstejovsky's coercionine ( : hanism ( Pustejovsky ,  1991) , the argument's semantic type changes for a semantic type found in one of its qualia  . In a variant approach ( Mineur and Buitelaar ,  1995) , a word has no a priori semantic type ; it in selected at composition time among the types found in the qualia  . In our approach , the head concept type associated with an argument does not change  . The chain found between this concept and the predicate's head concept only brings forward internmdiate concepts and relations which are aetualised in th  (  ; presence of the I ) re(ticate , and lead to a particula representation of their lnt?an-ing  . As a side-effect , his approach ix able to handle sentences like ( 6 )   ( 7 ) :  ( 6 ) dotm bought ah ) ngnOV 6`- I ( Godard and , layez ,  :\[993 )   ( 7 ) anaIlg ' ioI ) last y of as overestenosis Since the modifier ( long , sew ' , re ) and the action ( verb ' bought ' , noun ' angioplasty ' ) require incompatible types of the same noun ( novel : event vsot ) ject , stenosis : state vs object ) , tyl ) echanging via coercion cannot work on such sentences  . This prol)le in does not occur in our approach . 
Type coercion assumes that the t ) redi ( : ated rives semantice ompositiol l , and that the semantic representation of the argument in llst adapt to it  . In make a step towards finding their semantic link  . 
The resulting conceptual chain , as a whole , represents both the specific facet of the argument which is involved in the sentence and the conceptual role it plays in the predicate  . 
The preferences that grammatical relations assign to conceptual relations drive path selection  , taking into account he specific syntactic on text in which a semantic omposition is to occur  . This is crucial to let , e . g . , prepositions , influence the choice of the conceptual link and the resolution of the metonymy  . 
6 Conclusion
The overall goal of the MENELAS text understanding system was to build a normalised conceptual representation of the input text  . The aim of semantic analysis , in this context , is to build a representation which conforms to a domain model  . We therefore xperimented how this domain model could help semantic analysis to go from the flexibility of natural anguage to a constrained conceptual representation  , a typical problem encountered being metonymy . The approach presented here shows how this can be performed  . It has been fully implemented , and used with a reasonable size knowledge base as a part of the MENELAS text understanding system  . 
Metonymy processing is based on the domain model . Provided a new domain and task , with the corresponding domain model , this enables the generic method to adapt directly to this new domain and give results that are specific to it  . Building such a domain model is generally feasible insufficiently limited domains  , typically , technical domains . Much of the strength of the method then hinges on the quality of the domain model : the conceptype hierarchy and the attached reference models must be built in a principled way  ( Bouand et al ,  1995) .
