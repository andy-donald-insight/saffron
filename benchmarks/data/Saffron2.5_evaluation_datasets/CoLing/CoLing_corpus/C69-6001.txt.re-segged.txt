~ . Theapi ~ roach out1~ed below is to be understood as a compo-

rallanguages,
Roughly spea ~ . ingth~s method ( develor ~ . e6 in my forthcoming Elements of a Sem ~ . ntic Theor ~ r of T ~ tur ~ J Lan 6 u ~ es ) might be characterized , as fol\] . ows : I ? . A semantic ~ ystcmS in a very gener P . \] form ( like that of Carn ~ p's ' Language A ' or ' L~n : ~ e ~ b  , -o-~'-c ~ . _Carn ~ p , Introduc-tion to S ~ . bolicLogic and ItsA ~ , \]ic , ~ t  ~ ons ,  1958 ) is constr~cted : this system contains : - A \] ex ~ con  ( si , eeifying t~e~ig ~ zu ~ . ed)-~\]es of c~esi~nz,tion(el .

4 ?  . A new system , SL , is const~cted , ~- l ~ chactu ~ , \] Jyfulfi \]_ ~ the imposed conditions on trans\ ] ability in S  . St , in its gener ~ . l form , becomes an extension of S ; when S~~si'ut into corresy on-dence ~-- ith a concrete \] o~n~-~age  , the ' mean in , is ' ( i . e . des~n~t ~ ) assigned by these rules to different descrSptive signs of S&be-  . ', ' hhichic_come more definite . Under such conditions , ever ~ j sign from S ~ a translation of a sign from L  . has the s ~ , e ~ c not stum as the corresponding sign from \]~- . 
& - 2 - . ~? . Under condition 3? , if ~ is a translation in S ~ of a sentence ~ from  ~  , every characterization which holds for ~ ibo\ ] c\]s for the corresponding P ~  . too . 
ol ~ et us assume that , in agreement with the translation rules L " each ~erne I sentence of the simplest form  ( that means sentences u'~th no adverbials determiners  )   ( I ) NA rt V ( 2 ) NArt VNArt .   .  ? ,  .   .  ? ?  . o . o . ? o .   .   . o  ~ .   , c ~ be transJated in S by an individual descript ion  ( of course , only uqlen the article has the function of individualization  )  . 
In agreement with this assumption , if L ~ would be English , a ~ entence like ( 3 ) the horse is runn in ~--: oul ~ have as its appropriate translation in S~the exT ~ rer~ien  ( 4 )   ( ~ y ) ~x ) ~ HOx ~ ( x = y ) ) . RUd ( vhere ~\] ~ O ~ is a predicate consts~t which is a translation of c  1  ~'~' . _~j . hors_~e , RU is a predicate constant which is a translat ion of ~  . It is obvious that a translation like ( 4 ) does not account ~^~ of ~ , r . . . . tense the verb . 
~ norder to be able to represent in our semantic ~ ystem the tez  . ~ c ~ tinction from natural languages , we take the fol\]ov-ingway : ~ o . Uesh all transform our earlier system S : into a eo ordi-~te ~  , au ' ~ a_~(int1 ~ esense of Carnap's , Introduction . . . . , i~p . 161-171; tee also Carnap , ~ eanin ~ and Necessity , 196 o , pp .  7~,-75) . 
The individual expressions inst . and ard form are referr : oir ~ to ' ~ fos ~ tions ' in an ordered domain  . An expression like ' a ~-'
Jv ' ou \] ~ ~ ~ e signate the ' l ~ osition i ' at the ' timej '  . 
For our further discussion is enough to interpret each  -3 a  ~ .   .   . a ~' as different " locations " ezch expression of the form ' al  , --&" ~ in time of the same " thing " . The expression ' a ~' has to be inter ~--@ preted as designs J tingathing with no respect to its " time location "  ; in other words such an expression is to be understood as referring to a thir ~" abstracted " from time  , or - what iz the snme for us-being in any time . The expression i refers to the " empty " posit ionor to the " nul\]-thing "  . The number of the " posi-tions " is , perhaps , unfinite .

It is \] ~ u ~ own that , as far as ~ the natural languages are con-ccrned , the category of tense could be roughly defined as the relation between the time of the action  (  , expressed by the verb ) : ~ nd the time when the message is uttered ; that ? is to say the pre-rent " expresses " the simultaneity with the time the message is uttered  , the ~ osst expresses the anteriority with respect to the time of the message  an8 the future expresses the ~ osteriority : - Jth respect to the time of the message  . 
T~ . J . suse of defining tenses suggests the fol\]owing treatment of tense estegory in terms of our semantic system : \]  . o . The time of the message is to be represented by any v  , ~ . ._!ue of ~ from the expression ' s~' . 
2 ?  . If x is the ' thing ' referred to by an individual  desc-~5pt~'on   , then an expression like ' SIT~a ~ . ' expresses exactly the rel ~= . t ~ on of the ' thing ' referred to by t ~ evarmable x and the ? time of the message " expressed by ' a ~'  . That is , ' SI ~ . Z  ~ a . ~' means " ~_' . i ~ simultaneous ~: , ith the time of the rues : nags " , u % ich correspot " nd . ~ otD ~ . _definition of theiore sent . Analogously we . may inter-7ret the expressions ' POS xa ? . ',' ANTxaB . ' as corresponding to the rcf Jnitions ~ Tiven to the future and the past  , respectively . 
-\ scorching ~ m with 1?an~2? , we may establish the fo\]lowing tr ~'~ nc~~tJ on ~ le : "  ( 14 ) Translation rule : Replace ? the symbols Prez , ~ ast , ~uture from the sequences Prez Verb , Past Ver___~b , Future Verb generated by ~ a grcmmar G ~ by the expressions : ' Sl ~\[ xa  ; ' , ' ANTxa ; ' , ' POS x a ~' , respec ~ ively . 

Let us assui ~ e  ~ ow sentence (3) i ~' . T fiven together with its underlying P-mar Rerin the three tense versions above discussed  . 
We shall get the following three trans2ations : ( 4a )   ( ~ y )   ( x ) L ( HOxaI ~ )   . RU y . SlMxa ~\] (4c ) (~ y)(x) .  \[ ( H0x ~ Ixy ) @RUy ~0 ~ xa ~ 3 Obviously ( 4a ) is the translation for the ~- resent version , (4b ) - for the p~ast vers'ion , (4c ) - for the future version . 
Let us suppose that , in the ' state of ~ ffs , irst referred to by our expressions , the only thing having the ~ roperty ' horse ' is the thing being in the point '  a6~  ; oletus consider further ' a ~' I repre-senting the ' time of the message '  . In this case , if we put ' a #' instead of ~ , we may say that is true ; moreover , (4a ) is factua ~ l ~ true . 
If the position referred to by a ~ does not have actually thr-  -0 properties predicated by ( 4 a5 or if there are seve___ralpositions having the properties predicated by  ( as ! )  . , then (4a ) is . ~s , ~ . e , snd moreover , factually false . 
In contradistinction with the truth conditions of  ( 4a )  , ~"" ~7~1e ~2 are factua2 , th ~ logical ; (4a'l ) (4a '~) (4bI ) (4b ") (4e ') (40 , )
It is obvious sequence of truth conditions of the folio : ring expressions are \[_~~ no  ( x )  \[ ( TIOz6 , ~Ixa ?) , RU a ~ , AET xa~J$GR^~o(x ) "\[( HO xRIxa ~) . RU a ~ POS x a :_ 3 that a23 these expressions ' are faIse only as conthe ing  1-ostulates   ( 9 ) - ( 13 ) and hence are 2ogica \]_ly-6-fn\]me . "" ~ The intuitive interpretation of the L -false hood of these exPressions ~ nsc~s follows : for instance  ( 4a " ) says that a past event~nni ~= ~ O_taneous with the time of the message  ;   , sentence (4a ") says ~ . ture that a-event , " tlt: , t is an event which is not yet oceuring in the time of the messa-ce is simultaneous with the time of the message  . These interpre-t ~ . tions seem to mes . sgiving a purely semantic expression of prag-r_ ~tic~\]f ~ cts~'~here the'atitude ' ~ of the speaker towards the universeiz involved  . 
r . The above Troposed interpretation may account also for some "  , ~ . bl ~ T~o_es of the natural langu~ges . We shall ta \] rean example fl-o ~ , other lan ~ uaget ~ an English , which makes a distinction , bet-"::een the ' pure present ' and the " irogressive present "  . For ~ nstan-ee , in French the sentence : (\]5) Leehien cuid or ~ , mange beau coup . 
nig~ht beint ~: r preted as saying that : ( 15 a ) the dog ~ and eats at the time ~ vhen themes - , sage is uttered ( 15 b ) the dog sleeps at the time when the message is uttered and in c ~ eneral eats  ( much )  . 
Obviously interpretation ( 15 a ) chars ~ cterizes ( 15 ) as L-felse , (15h ) ~- s possibly F-true . 
Thir : situation can be accounted for by supplementing the tran~\]~t~n ~  . 1\]e ( 14 ) with the following statement : ( 14 a ) RepZace the symbol Prezby: ( ~ ) SI~xa ~ or by ( Nsn~a " ~ es-7-The underlying structure of ( 15 ) is represented by the senten- ( 15~ ) Lechiendors . 
(15 ~ Lechienman ~ e ( be aucoup).
( We sb ~ ll disregard the word beaucou ~ , because it is ~ r relevant for our disc~ssicn . ) Let ' CH'~,'DO,~r . d'1~t ~' be the predicates by which chien , __d ? r-N : ~ ir nnd ~ ~ rc to be translated in S ~ ~ nd'aI'the time of the message  . The tr ~ . ~slation of (15~, l~o ~ wfil\]be , resi . ectively:
YAyeSl~?\[xa~\]
Let u ~' consider S ~ , accounting for French , has a mea_~ing postulate saying predicates ' DO ' n ~' ITA ' are incompatible simultaneous \] y  . 
Obviously , int\]' . is c~se the c_lass comprising sentences (15~L' ,  ~ , I ) it : inconsistent , or : the conjsnct ~ on of (15g ') and (15~') is

If we choose the other ~ o ~ ib\]etr ~ . nslation , i . e . 

Then the class coml- . rising (15~#, ~") can be ~ o~sibly F-true and . 
so can be their corresponSing conjunction.
Translations (15~' , ~' ~ account for tl ~ e ' meaning ' (15a ) ; tr~tns-Sations(15 ~ ~ , ~") account for the r ~ eaning (15b ) . 
It is easy to see that the fcctsnc counted for in ~ are of pu-rely semantic nature  , in contradistinction with the merely pragma-tic nature of the facts accounted for in  4  . In the former case only the ' meaning ' of the expressions ' CH x '  , ' DO x ' , ' ~ Ax ' an ~' SIK ' xa ~' is involved , whereas in the cases under 4 we h~ve had to do with various possibilities of " referrfing  , , be J ~ at the ~ isposal " of the speaker .
