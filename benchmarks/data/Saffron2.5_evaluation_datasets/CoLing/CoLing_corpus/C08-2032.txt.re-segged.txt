Abstract
This paper proposes a novel method for building a bilingual lexicon through a pivot language by using phrasebased statistical machine translation ( SMT ). Given two bilingual lexicons between language pairs
L f ? L p and L p ? L e , we assume these lexicons as parallel corpora . Then , we merge the extracted two phrase tables into one phrase table between L f and L e . Finally , we construct a phrasebased SMT system for translating the terms in the lexicon L f ? L p into terms of L e and , obtain a new lexicon L f ? L e . In our experiments with ChineseEnglish and JapaneseEnglish lexicons , our system could cover 72.8% of Chinese terms and drastically improve the utilization ratio.
1 Introduction
The bilingual lexicon is a crucial resource for multilingual applications in natural language processing including machine translation ( Brown et al , 1990) and crosslingual information retrieval ( Nie et al , 1999). A number of bilingual lexicons have been constructed manually , despite their expensive compilation costs . However , it is unrealistic to build a bilingual lexicon for every language pair ; thus , comprehensible bilingual lexicons are available only for a limited number of language pairs.
One of the solutions is to build a bilingual lexicon of the source language L f and the target L e through a pivot language L p , when large bilingual c ? 2008.

lexicons L f ? L p and L p ? L e are available . Numerous researchers have explored the use of pivot languages ( Tanaka and Umemura , 1994; Schafer and Yarowsky , 2002; Zhang et al , 2005). This approach is advantageous because we can obtain a bilingual lexicon between L e and L f , even if no bilingual lexicon exists between these languages.
Pivot-based methods for dictionary construction may produce incorrect translations when the word w e is translated from a word w f by a polysemous pivot word w p semy problem in pivot-based methods ( Tanaka and Umemura , 1994; Schafer and Yarowsky , 2002).
Pivot-based methods also suffer from a mismatch problem , in which a pivot word w p from a source word w f does not exist in the bilingual lexicon L p ?
L e terms is prone to include a number of pivot terms that are not included in another lexicon.
This paper proposes a method for building a bilingual lexicon through a pivot language by using phrasebased statistical machine translation ( SMT ) ( Koehn et al , 2003). We build a translation model between L f and L e by assuming two lexicons L f ? L p and L p ? L e as parallel corpora , in order to increase the obtained lexicon size by handling multiword expressions appropriately . The main advantage of this method is its ability to incorporate various translation models that associate languages L f ? L e ; for example , we can further improve the translation model by integrating a small bilingual lexicon L f ? L e .
1A Japanese term ????: dote , embankment , may be associated with a Chinese term ???,? y??ngha?ng : banking institution , using the pivot word bank in English.
2It is impossible to associate two translation pairs (??? ??? ( chikyu?-ondanka ),? global warming ), and ( global heating , ????? ( qua?nqiu?-bia`nnua?n )?) because of the difference in English ( pivot ) terms.

Figure 1: Framework of our approach 2 Merging two bilingual lexicons We introduce phrasebased SMT for merging the lexicons , in order to improve both the merged lexicon size and its accuracy . Recently , several researchers proposed the use of the pivot language for phrasebased SMT ( Utiyama and Isahara , 2007; Wu and Wang , 2007). We employ a similar approach for obtaining phrase translations with the translation probabilities by assuming the bilingual lexicons as parallel corpora . Figure 1 illustrates the framework of our approach.
Let us suppose that we have two bilingual lexicons L f ? L p and L p ? L e . We obtain word alignments of these lexicons by applying GIZA ++ ( Och and Ney , 2003), and grow-diag-final heuristics ( Koehn et al , 2007). Let w ? x be a phrase that represents a sequence of words in the language
L x . For phrase pairs ( w ? p , w ? f ) and ( w ? e , w ? p ), the translation probabilities p(w ? p | w ? f ) and p(w ? e | w ? p ) are computed using the maximum likelihood estimation from the cooccurrence frequencies , consistent with the word alignment in the bilingual lexicons . We calculate the direct translation probabilities between source and target phrases , p(w ? e | w ? f ) = ? w ? p p(w ? e | w ? p ) p(w ? p | w ? f ) ? w ? ? e ? w ? p p(w ? ? e | w ? p ) p(w ? p | w ? f ) . (1) We employ the loglinear model of phrasebased SMT ( Och and Ney , 2002) for translating the source term w ? f in the lexicon L f ? L p into the target language by finding a term ? w ? e that maximizes the translation probability , ? w ? e = argmax w ? e
Pr(w ? e | w ? f ) = argmax w ? e
M ? m=1 ? m h m ( w ? e , w ? f ), (2) where we have M feature functions h m ( w ? e , w ? f ) and model parameters ? m .
In addition to the typical features for the SMT framework , we introduce two features : character-based similarity , and additional bilingual lexicon.
We define a character-based similarity feature , h char sim ( w ? e , w ? f ) = 1 ?
ED(w ? e , w ? f ) max(w ? e , w ? f ) , (3) where ED(x , y ) represents a Levenshtein distance of characters between the two terms x and y3. We also define an additional bilingual lexicon feature , h add lex ( w ? e , w ? f ) = ? i log p ? ( w ? ( i ) e | w ? ( i ) f ), (4) where w?(i ) e and w?(i ) f represent an ith translated phrase pair on the term pair ( w ? e , w ? f ) during the decoding , and p?(w?(i ) e | w ? ( i ) f ) represents the phrase translation probabilities derived from the additional lexicon . The probability p?(w?(i ) e | w ? ( i ) f ) is calculated using the maximum likelihood estimation.
3 Experiment 3.1 Data
For building a Chinese-to-Japanese lexicon , we used the JapaneseEnglish lexicon released by JST4 (527,206 term pairs ), and the ChineseEnglish lexicon compiled by Wanfang Data5 (525,259 term pairs ). Both cover a wide range of named entities and technical terms that may not be included in an ordinary dictionary . As an additional lexicon , we used the Japanese-English-Chinese trilingual lexicon6 (596,967 term pairs ) generated from EDR7 JapaneseEnglish lexicon.
We lowercased and tokenized all terms by the following analyzers : JUMAN8 for Japanese , the MEMM-based POS tagger9 for English , and cjma ( Nakagawa and Uchimoto , 2007) for Chinese.

Table 1: The statistics of lexicons lization ratio10 in the parentheses . For comparison , we prepared two baseline systems for building Chinese-Japanese lexicons . Exact matching connects source and target terms that share at least one common translation term in the pivot language . Unique matching is an extreme approach for avoiding negative effects of polysemous pivot terms : it connects source and target terms if source , pivot , and target terms appear only once in the corresponding lexicons.
Exact matching achieved 26.2% of the utilization ratio in Japanese-to-Chinese translation , and 22.2% in Chinese-to-Japanese translation . These figures imply that about 75% of the terms remained unused in building the Japanese-Chinese lexicon.
With unique matching , as little as 1% of Japanese and Chinese terms could be used . In contrast , our method could cover 72.8% of Chinese terms by generating Japanese terms , which was a drastic improvement in the utilization ratio.
3.3 Generating Japanese translations of the
ChineseEnglish lexicon
For evaluating the correctness of the merged lexicons , we assumed the lexicon generated by the unique matching as a development/test set . Development and test sets consist of about 2,400 term pairs , respectively . Next , we input Chinese terms in the development/test set into our system based on Moses ( Koehn et al , 2007), and obtained the Japanese translations . We evaluated the performance by using BLEU , NIST , and accuracy measures . Table 2 shows the evaluation results on the test set . Our system could output correct translations for 68.5% of 500 input terms . The table also reports that additional features were effective in improving the performance.
We also conducted another experiment to generate Japanese translations for Chinese terms included in an external resource . We randomly ex-10The number of terms in the original lexicon used for building the merged lexicon.

Table 3: Evaluation results for the Eijiro dictionary tracted 500 ChineseEnglish term pairs from the Wanfang Data lexicon , for which the English term cannot be mapped by the JST lexicon , but can be mapped by another lexicon Eijiro11. Table 3 shows the results for these 500 terms . Prec1 or Prec10 are the precisions that the 1- or 10-best translations include the correct one , respectively . MRR ( mean reciprocal rank ) is (1/500)? i (1/r i ), where r i is the highest rank of the correct translations for the ith term.
Since the input lexicons are ChineseEnglish term pairs , their Japanese translations can be generated directly from the English terms by applying an EnglishChinese translation system . We compared our system to an English-Japanese phrasebased SMT system ( E-to-J translation ), constructed from the JST JapaneseEnglish lexicon.
Table 3 shows that our system outperformed the English-to-Japanese direct translation system.
Table 4 displays translation examples . The first example shows that our system could output a correct translation ( denoted by [ T ]); and the E-to-J system failed to translate the source term ([ F ]), because it could not reorder the source English words and translate the word pubis correctly . In the second example , our system could reproduce Chinese characters ??? ( fluid )?, but the E-to-J system output a semantically acceptable but awkward Japanese term . In the last example , the word segmentation of the source Chinese term was incorrect (???? ( lumber )?? ( lymph )?? is correct ). Thus , our system received an invalid word ? ??? and could not find a translation for the word.

L p and L p ? L e , we constructed a phrasebased SMT system from L f ? L e by merging the lexicons into a phrase translation table L f ? L e . The experimental results demonstrated that our method improves the utilization ratio of given lexicons drastically . We also showed that the pivot approach was more effective than the
SMT system that translates from L p to L e directly.
The future direction would be to introduce other resources such as the parallel corpora and other pivot languages into the SMT system for improving the precision and the coverage of the obtained lexicon . We are also planning on evaluating a machine translation system that integrates our model.
