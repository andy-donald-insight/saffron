This paper presents an algorithm for selecting an appropriate classifier word for a noun  . In Thailanguage , it frequently happens that there is fluctuation in the choice of classifier for a given concrete noun  , both from the point of view of the whole speech community and individual speakers  . Basically , there is no exact rule for classifier selection . As far as we can do in the rule ~ based approach is to give a default rule to pick up a corresponding classifier of each noun  . 
Registration of classifier for each noun is limited to the type of unit classifier because other types  , are open due to the meaning of representation . We propose a corpus-based method ( Biber , 1993; Nagao , 1993; Smadja , 1993 ) which generates Noun Classifier Associations ( NCA ) to overcome the problems in classifier assignment and semantic construction of noun phrase  . The NCA is created statistically from a large corpus and recomposed under concept hierarchy constraints and frequency of occurrences  . 
Keywords : Thai language , classifier , corpus-based method , Noun Classifier Associations ( NCA)1 . Introduction A classifier has a significant use in Thailanguage t br construction of noun or verb to express quantity  , determination , pronoun , etc . By far the most common use of classifiers , however , is in enumerations , where the classifiers follow numerals and precede demonstratives  ( Noss , 1964) . Not all types of classifier have a relationship with noun or verb as a unit classifier does  . 
A unit classifier is any classifier which has a special relationship with one or more concrete nouns  . 
For example , to enumerate members of the class of/rya /' boats '  , tile unit classifier/lain / is selected as in the phrase below : / ryanunglain/boat one < boat > ' one boat '  . 
Other than tile unit classifier , there are collective classifier , metric classifier , frequency classifier and verbal classifier . 
A collective classifier is , any classifier which shows general group or set of mass nouns  , una ~ ~/ nok soonglung /' two flocks of bird  '  . A metric classifier is any classifier which occurs in enumerations that modify predicates as well as nouns  , v lh l ~1 ~ , u ~/ nams aamka ew /' three glasses of water ' . 
A frequency classifier is any classifier which is used to express the frequency of event that occurs  , ~ u ~ ~ mJ/binsii roob /' fly four rounds ' . A verbal classifier is any classifier which is derived from a verb and usually used in construction with mass nouns  , n ~ z~q ~ a #~11" ) 11/kradaadhaamuan /' five rolls of paper ' . 
The unit classifier has a special relationship with concrete noun  . The member of this class of classifier is closed for each noun  . Most of the unit classifiers m'e used with a great many concrete nouns of very different meaning  , but few are restricted to a single noun . Except for the unit classifier , the members of classifier for a noun or predicate are open  . 
Especially for the metric classifier , the number of classifiers for numeral expression of distance  , size , weight , container and value is large . 
The use of classifier in Thai is not limited to then unmral expression but is extended to other expression such as ordinal  , determination , relative pronoun , pronoun , etc . The detail of each classifier phrase is described in the next section  . 
In many existing natural anguage processing systems  , tile list of available classifiers lk3r each noun is attached to a lexicon base . Rules for classifier selection from the list can somehow provide the appropriateness  , t lowever , the problems on classifier phrase construction still remain unsolved  . 
To overcome the problems of using classifiers , we propose a method of classifier phrase extracting fl'om a large corpus  . As a result , Noun-Classifier Associations ( dcscribcd in Section 3 ) is statistically created to define the relationship between a noun and a classifier in a classifier phrase  . With the li'equency of tile occurrence of a classifier in a classifier phrase  , we can propose the most a pl ) rot ) riate use of a classilier . Furthermore , we introduce a hierarchy of semantic class for tile induction of a classifier class when they are employed to construct with nouns which belong to the same class of meaning  . 
Section 3 and Section 4 ( lescribc the generation and the imlflcmentation f the NCA  , respectively . 
2 . The roles of classilier in Thaihm guage in Thai language  , we use classifiers illwuious situations . The classilier plays at u important role ill COllStrtlciiou with tln Ull to express ordinal  , pronoun , for instance . The classifier phrase is syntactically geneutted according to a specific patten L Fig  .  2 . 1 show t ; the position of a classifier in each pattern , where N stand slot noun , NCNM stands for cardinal nnnl her , CI , stallds for classifier , DET stands for determiner , VATF stands for attributive verh , Rt ' iLM stands for relative marker , ITR .

" file classifier assignment for non-conceptual representation all d the classifier selection of o \[ let on unly conceptual representation arc over handleable by the rule-based approach  . The propose on classifier assignment using the corpus-based method is another approach  . Based on the collocation of noun and classifier of each pattern shown in Fig  .  2 . 1 , we decided to construct the Noun Classifier Association table  ( see Section 3 )  . A stocMs tic method combined with the concept hierarchy is proposed as a strategy in making the NCA table  . The table composes of the information about nonn -classifier collocation  , statistic occurrences and the representative classifier for each semantic lass in the concept hierarchy  . 
3 . Extraction of Noun-Classifier Collocation 1 , 1 this section , wc describe tile algorithm used for extraction of Noun Classifier Associations  ( NCA ) from a large corpus . We used a 40 megabyte Thai coq ) us collected from wu ' ious areas to create tile table  . The algorithm is as follows:
Step 1: Word segmentation.
Input : A corpus.
Output : The word o segmented corpus.
hitext processing , we often need word boundary information lot several puqms es  . Because Thai has no explicit raarke , to separate words from one another , we have top rc process the corpus with word segmentation program  . We used the program developed by Sornl crthmwanich  ( 1993 ) with postediting to correct fault segm cntation . The program employs heuristic rules of longest malching and least word count in coq  ) orated with character combining rules for Thai words  . Thoughtile accuracy of the word segmentation does not reach  100%  , but it is high enough ( more than 95% ) to reduce the post-~iting time . 
Step 2: Tagging.
Input : Output of step 1.
Output : The corpus of which each word is tagged with a part of speech and a semantic lass  . 
The word-segmented corpus is then processed with a stochastic paW of  . -st)eed , tagger . Each word w together with its part of speech is then used to reUieve the semantic class of tile word fiom a dictionary  . The result yields a data structure of ( w , p , s ) , where p denotes the pm-t of speech of w and s denotes the semantic htss of w  . For example , the data structure of the word fihf ~ mAhlakrian / ' student'is  ( ffnt ~ ou , NCMN , person ) , where NCMN stml ( ls for common noun and t ) crs on rel ) rescntsffntTml in file class of person .

Fig . 3.2 Concept hierarchy
Instead of picking up the data sentence by sentence  , we extracted a fragment of data arouud the el , because there is no explicit marker to indicate sentence boundaries  . We used the range of -10 to +2 words around the clin our experiments which appeared to cover most of cooccurrence patterns  . 
Step 4: PaRernnaatching
Input : Output of step 3.
Output : A list of nouns-classifiers with frequency intormatiou of cooccurrences  . 
In this step , the tagged corpus is matched with each pattern of classifier occurrences shown below : 
No-NCNM-CL ( Enumeration )
N--CL-~/tii/-NCNM ( Ordinal expression )
N--CL-DET ( Referential expression )
N--DET-CL ( In definite demonstration expression ) 
N--CL-VA'IT ( Attribute noun phrase)
CL-N ( Noun modifier)
N--CL-~/tii/,~/sung/,"ht/n,'fi/, . .   ( Relative/Interrogative pronoun ) where N denotes noun , CL denotes classifier , NCNM denotes c~u'dinal number , DET denotes determiner , A ,  .   . 4 VATF denotes attributive verb , ~ l/tu / , ~/ sung/and'\[u/nai/are specific Thai words  , AB denotes a consecutive pair of A and 1 t , aud A--B denotes a possibly separated pair . Actually , A--B can be experiments we considered only possible separations by a relative pronoun phrase having no more than  5 words . This is to limit the search space of general cases to a manageable size with some loss of generality  . 
The pattern matching process was carried out one by one with each pattern  . For each pattern of A--BC , the matching of BC pair was simple and was performed at first  . Next , the matching of a pair A--B was done by : 1 . searching for the nearest A from B . If found , markAI . 
2 . from B within a span of five , searching for the nearest relative pronoun . If found , markpl thengo to 3 . Otherwise , match A1 . 
3. further searching for the nearest A from p1.
If found , mark A2 . If A2 is farther from B than A1, match A2 . Otherwise , match AI . 
At the end of these steps , we obtained a list of nouns Ni along with the frequency of w in the corpus for each matching pattern  ( see Fig .  3 . 1 for sample ouq mts ) . Each entry is of the form ( W_N 1 , CLN2 , Freq ) where W denotes a noun ,   N1 denotes a number representing semantic class of W  , CL denotes the associated classifier ,   N2 is a number indicating whether CL is a unitor collective classifier  ( 1 for unit , 2 for collective ) and Freq denotes the frequency of cooccurrence between W and CL  . The semantic lass is shown in Fig .  3 . 2 . 
Step 5: Determine representative classifier Input : A list of noun-classifier with frequency information of cooccurrence  . 
Output : Representative classifier of each noun and each semantic lass of nouns  . 
As it can be observed in Fig .  3 . 1 , each noun may be used with several possible classifiers  . In language generation process . However , we have to select only one of them . For each noun we select the classifier with the greatest value of cooccurrence frequency to be the representative classifier for both representative unit classifier and representative collective classifier  . Tile classifier in Fig .  3 . 1 , for example , will have ~__1 as the representative unit classifier and haven ~   2 as the representative collective one for the noun sm ~ nr ~ unq ' ~  111  . Collective classifiers are used instead of unit classifiers when the notion of " group ' is required  . 
We also find the representative classifier for each semantic lass of nouns in the same manner  . For each semantic lass of nouns ( grouped by the semantic class attached with each noun  )  , the classifier with the greatest value of cooccurrence frequency is selected to be the representative  . The classifier is used to handle the assignment of classifier to noun which does not exist in the trained corpus  . For example , the representative unit classifiers for each semantic lass extracted by the pattern  ( N--NC NM-CL ) are shown in
Fig . 3.3.
4. Classifier Resolution
The associations as produced in the previous section are useful for determining a proper classifier for a given noun  . For a noun occurring ill the corpus , alternative determination is accomplished in a straightforward manner by using its associated representative classifier which occurs in the corpus more frequently than any other classifiers  . In the other case where the given noun does not exist in tile corpus  , the determination is done by using the representative classifier of its class in the concept hierarchy  . 
Some examples of classifier determining are listed below  .   ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) show the case of nouns appearing in the corpus , while (2) and (4) show a different scenario . In (2) , the unit classifier of/appem/is obtained by using the representative unit classifier of its class " fruit ' which is ~ n_~/luuld according to Fig  . 
3 . 3 . Similarly , in (4) , the collective classifier of/gangker dis determined by the representative collective classifier of its class " animal ' which is  ~2 /fuung\] .

5 . Conclusion " File proposed approach is a significantly new method to manipulate the classifier phrase in Thai language  . The fact that the expression of some syntactic on stituents needs a specific classifier to be constnmted with and the selection of classifier lot each noun or noun phrase depends on tile traditional use and the senmnticlass  . 
The corpus-based approach is quite suitable for detecting the traditional use and searching for the most appropriate one wlmn it does not exist in the corpus yet  . 
Concept hierarchy of noun provides another path for searching when the NCA does not cover the noun in question  . 
In the future , this NCA will be included in the generation process of Machine Translation to solve the classifier assignment  , and incoqmrated in the analysis process to produce a proper syntactic and semantic structure  . The classifier will then be a key for pattern disambiguation when it is fixed to one of the patterns illustrated in Fig  .  2 . 1 .
