The paper contains the description of a database management computer operation system called operation logic  . This system is a formal logic with well-def lned formulas as semantic language clauses and with reasoning by means of modusponens rules  . There are four frames-CLAUSE , QUESTION , I : ~ O~T . ~, SYST ~ . Each of these frames is processed by one program  . By means of these programs it can be realized under-standing of any clause  , answering any reasonable question , solving az~7 reasonable problem and understanding any organ izat-lonel structure  . Some algorithms of operation logic are de-sc ribed and examples of clauses are exhibi ted  . Our approach is the following : ( 1 ) Information process in ~ of subteots ~ Mater ial objects are an organic objects or org an icones  . They are also non-live objects or live ones  . Live objects reproduce themselves auto- nomously  . Live objects are organic individuals or a rtificial ones  . Organic individuals are one-cellular or mu lti-cellular  . 
They are also heterotrophic ( they consume organic objects ) or autotrophic ( they consume an organic objects only )   . Multi-cell-ular autotrophic organic individuals are called pl~ts  . Multi-cellular heterotrophio organic individuals are called subteots  . 
Plants have no moving organs and no consc iousness  . They do not need them . Subjects have moving organs and consciousness . 
They need them for searching , hunting and escape . Each sub-Jects has general knowledge database . It contains information - 234 -about types of scenes ( called image-frames ) in the form the scenes are seen by the subject by its eyes  , but in a very simplified form . It contains also sequences of scenes ( called sceneries ) representing rules ( called mg du sponens rules ) according to which changes in the universe are realized  . Each subject has concrete knowledge database representing history of life of the sub ject and image-frame of actual scene ~ Each subject constructs possible scenes and rea lizes program  , ed behaviour of itself . Each sub , so thas information processing database mans ~ ament operation system having both above data- bases in longterm memory ~ nd processing actua l knowledge in short term memory  . A subject is called human , if it is able to describe scenes by means of processes  ( i . e . to decode image--frames into formulu ( called clauses ) representing processes ) and if it constructs ~ ew clauses from the o l dones by means of modusponens rules  ( called reason S )   . Subjects with consci-ousness without above properties are called animals  . Humans operation system for information processing is called oe_~  . e ~ - i on logic , humans clauses form & system called semantic language  . Humans have the ability to exchange info rmation among themselves by means of clauses  ( such activity is called di ~ o ~ )   . We have thus the following stages of info rmation processing : First there are an organic objects only  . Then organ-ic objects appear by a random . Then by means of natural select-ion one -cellular heterotrophie organic individuals  ( bacteria ) appear . From bacteria one-cellular autotrophic organic individuals are developed  ( cy an oph ? cae )  . Prombacteria more sophlsti-c~te done-cellular heterotrophic protozoa are developed and by symbios is from protozoa and cyanop ~ v cae one -cellular auto-trophical ~ ae appear  . From algae plants are developed and from protozoa animals  . From animals humans are developed ( namely because of necessity of exchange information in social product-ion activities  )  . 
(2) Semantic la ~ a ~ a ~ e clause . In each scene there are individuals ( like TREE , JOHN , FEAR ) and processes ( like TO-GO , -235-TO-EXPLAIN ) . Names of individuals are called atomic individu -al__  . ss ( or nouns ) , names of processes are called verb__ . _ ~ s . In each process participating individuals play Certain roles  ( called individual members ) like ( TO-GOWHOWITH-WHOM )  , ( TO-EXPLAIN WHOWHATTO-WHOM ) . Individuals have properties ( like BLUE , EMPTY ) . Processes have properties ( like QUICKLY , DAILY ) . Pro-pertiee of individuals are called attributes , properties of processes are called adverbs . Names of attributes are called atomic attributes ( or adjectives )  , names of adverbs are call-ed atomic adverbs . There are several types of adverbs ( called Bd verbial . members ) , each of them describes the circumstances the process is realized  . The process is realized in euclideanthree dimensibnal space  ( NHERE-PLACE , WHERE-NEAR , WHERE-FAR , ~IERE-INSIDE , % ~-/~ E-OUTSIDE , ~ CdF . ~%E-BESIDE , WHERE-LEPT , WHERE--HIGHT , V ~ RE-BEPORE , WHERE-BEHIND , WHERE-BELOW , WHERE-ABOVE , ~- AROUND , VP ~ ERE-A~ONG , ~/ tEaRET ~ F ~ N , FROM , TO , VIA , DISTANCE ) in linear time scale ( WHEN-ANTERIORITY , WHEN-SIMUL-TANEITY , r ~ N-POSTERIORITY , BEGI~ING , END , FREQUENCY , DURAT-ION ) undervalidity of several modusponens rules ( CAUSE , RESULT , PURPOSE , CONCESSION ) with instruments ( BY-MEANS-OF ) and a coord in E to algorithm types ( BY-~AT-WAY , INTENSITY , RESEMBLING ) . Hence we have ( ATOMIC-IN DIVIDUAL ( ATTRIBUTE ( K ) ) K ) for individuals ( such form is called compound individual ) and ( VERB ( INDIVIDUAL-~3ER ( I ) ) I ( ADVERBIAL-MEM~ER ( J ) ) J ) for processes i . e . for clauses . Modusponens rules are of the form ( IFCLAUSESTHENCLAUSES )  . Individual can be atomic individual , compound individual , process-as-individual clause , metalevel clause . Adverb can be atomic adverb , individual , adverb-defining clause . Attribute can be atomic attribute , individual , attribute-defining clause . To each clause some information about the whole clause belongs  ( called clause parameters )  . Individual members and adverbial members are called clause members  . Hence we have ( VERBCLAUSE-MEMBERS
CLAUSE-PARAME TERS )  ? - 236 - ( 3 ) Clause Darjneters . 
( a ) Conte ~ tuatit ~ . Because of existence of shortterm memory one must distinguish in each clause the old knowledge  ( called topic ) and the new one ( called focus ) receiving thus either ( TOPIC-VERBTOPIC-CLAUSE-HEMBERS FOCUS-CLAUSE-M ~BERS  ) or ( POCUS-VERBTOPIC-CLAUSE-MEmBERS POOUS-CLAUSE-~Y ~ S  )   . 
(b ) Tense-Because individuals , adverbs and attributes can be clauses , we have for each clause a graph tree with clauses as vertices and to-be-superior-clause-of as edges  . 
One needs only relative binary time relations ( anteriority , simultaneity , posteriority ) . We consider time of construction of the clause and time of clause process realization  . Time of construction of metalevel clause is the time of process realization of the superior clause  . Time of construction of clause of other types i s the time of construction of its superior clause  ( or in the case of top clause-the time of sending it by sender  )   . Other binar ~ time relations ( if needed ) can be given by time adverbs . 
(c ) Quantifiers . The simplest way in using quantifiers is to have only ALL and SOME with areas given in attributes  . 
( d ) ~ ot ~ The negation is used only in build ing scenes : We have old knowledge about scene  . We expect new knowledge . 
We add new knowledge . We negate expected but untrue knowledge . 
Prom this we have the following zeither we negate new expected focus  ( i . e . focus with or without verb ) or we negate topic verb only .

(4) Understand in ~ . Clauses are grouped into role-pairs ( WHY-ROLE-CLAUSE HOW-ROLE-CLAUSES )  , modusponens rules , scenes and denote-clauses . Content of clauses is given by means of such grouping  . It enables to operate with vague notions and even with contradictions  . Each system , say S , is described by input and output of structures , energy and records , by struct-ures as means and records as database , by scenes and by role--pairs , where wh~-roles are the roles being fulfilled by S and how-roles are why-roles of subsystems of S  . Understanding of very large systems and semantic mathematical analysis of anthropoeco eystems is realized by the binary relation to-be--subsystem -of defined by role-pairs on SYSTEM's  . Example: ( ROLE-PAIR ( 24 ) :  ( WHY-ROLE : ( TO-RECEIVE ( WHO:IT )   ( WHAT : GLUCOSE ) ) )   ( HOW-ROLE ( 1 ) :  ( TO-REALIZE ( WHO:IT )   ( WHAT:PHOTO-sn~sls )   )   ) ) - 239 -
