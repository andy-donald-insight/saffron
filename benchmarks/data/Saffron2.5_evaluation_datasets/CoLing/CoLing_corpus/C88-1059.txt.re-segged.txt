A method of generating a Japanese sentence by inferring function words from content words using valency pa~terns is presented  . 
A procedure for selecting an appropriate function word  , on the assumption that correct content words have been selected for a given phrase lattice  , is described . A methodol ~ inferring a correct verb when verbs are recognized less accurately than nouns by the speech recognition system is described  . Sentences are produced from content words as inputs by using the valency patterns ohtained from collected dialogue sentences in a restricted  1ask domain . Using the semantic features of preceding nouns and valency patterns allow a \[ airly restricted number of candidate verbs to be inferred  . 
This method eliminates possible errors at the interface between speech recognition and machine translation  ( component technologies of an Automatic Telephone Interpretation system  ) and selects the most appropriate candidate from a lattice of typical phrases output by  1he speech recognition system . 
1 Background and problems
An Automatic Telephone Interpretation system is a facility which enables a person speaking in one language to communicate readily by telephone with someone speaking another  . Three constituent technologies are necessary for such a system : speech recognition  , machine translation , and speech synthesis . 
Basic research in each of these technologies to develop an interpretation system between Japanese and English has already started  . For this purpose , however , an effective interface between speech recognition and machine translation is vital because output from the speech recognition module will inevitably contain errors which the machine translation module cannot accept  . 
This paper proposes a method of generatin qa Japanese sentence by inferring function words from content words using valency patterns  . This technique is aimed at the selection of the most appropriate candidate from a typical phrase lattice that may result from a speech recognition system  . 
2 Basic assumptions
In this study the following restrictions relevant to the interface problem are assumed :  ( 1 ) A Japanese sentence usually consists of a certain number of noun phrases followed by a verb phrase at the end  . The basic unit of speech recognition is assumed to be a continuously uttered phrase  , so that any input to the machine translation module is a ' phrase lattice '  , i . e . , a set of phrase candidates hypothesized by the speech recognition module  . 
(2 ) The range of telephone conversation tasks is restricted to inquiries from a researcher to a clerk about an international conference concerning the main topic of the conference  , deadlines for paper submission , exhibitions , social events , accommodation , payment , cancellation , etc . .

('When is the deadline for a manuscript ?' ) Usually a Japanese phrase begins with a jiritsugo -word  ( J-word for short ) such as a noun or verb , and ends with a sequence of fuzokugo-words ( E-words for short ) such as postpositional particles or auxiliary verbs  . In the above notation , boundaries between J-words and F-words are explicitly indicated by hyphens  , and all F-words are italicized . 
Figure 1 shows an example of a phrase lattice for this sentence obtained as the result of speech recognition  . 
Notice that there are candidates for both J-words and F-words together with a recognition score of the probability that the word is correct  . The problem is to select the most appropriate candidate from this phrase lattice  . 
3.2 Selection-by-generation approach
Attention is focused on candidates for F-words , assuming that J-words have already been correctly selected by a suitable method  . 
The assumption that J-words have been correctly selected is realistic if the task domain is limited enough to allow a high recognition rate for J-words and a knowledge base  , etc . is available for the limited task domain . Techniques related to this procedure are now being studied  . Of the J-words , the predicate at the end of a sentence is less accurately recognized by the speech recognition module than nouns  . A method to solve this problem will be discussed in the second half of this paper  . 
In Figure 1 , for instance , it is assumed that a sequence of J-words : ' c ) enkou''shimekiri''itsu ' ( manuscript ' )   ( ' deadline ' )   ( ' when ' ) has been correctly selected according to the recognition scores  . Corresponding to these J-words , there are three sets of candidates for F-words in the phrase lattice : ' wo ' ' wa '' desuka '' too''ga""deshita''no'"bekika '  . 
Our major concern here is the subproblem of selecting the most appropriate one in each of these sets  . 
This subproblem is characteristic of the Japanese language  . In fact , as easily seen in the above example , frequently used F-words , specifically those indicating grammatical cases such as ' ga '  , " wo ' , " ni ' , etc . , are too short to be recognized correctly . Their recognition scores are much lower than those of J-words  . But in Japanese it is often possible to infer the meaning of a given sentence from the sequence of J-words when the task domain is narrow  . 

Our method of selecting the correct F-words is composed of two steps :  1  ) generate a meaningful sentence by inferring suitable F-words for a given sequence of J -words  , and 2 ) compare these inferred F-words with the candidates in the phrase lattice to select those most appropriate  . 
This idea of ' selection-by-generation ' distinguishes this approach from previous ones : Hayes et al  \[1\] for English or Niedermair \[2\] for German . In this paper only Step 1 , which is considered the key step , will be discussed . 
4 Generating a sentence by inferring F-words The task domain is restricted to inquiries about an international conference  , and therefore the dialogue is basically a repetition of simple questions and answers  . 
This increases the probability of inferring the correct F-words for each phrase  . 
4.1 Key information for the inference
The following types of information are used to infer F-words  . The information is described in a lexicon of J -words  . 
(1 ) Semantic features of nouns and valency patterns First  , two types of semantic features are setup for nouns appearing in the restricted task domain  . One is a general type of semantic feature , independent of the task domain , such as abstract , action , concrete , human , location , time , number and diversity . The other is a specific type of semantic feature dependent on the task domain  . Table 1 shows examples of such features . 
Using these semantic features valency patterns of the basic predicates necessary in the task domain are defined  . As an example , the predicate ' okuru ' ( ' send ' in English ) is given the following valency patterns :
N\[con/-tra\]'wo'+V ,
N\[con/-tra\]'wa ' + N\[I oc\]'ni'+ V  , N\[con/-tra\]'wa ' + N\[hum\]'ni' + V  , N\[con/-tra\]'wa "+ N\[tim/pro\]' madeni'+V  , N\[tim/pro\]'madeni"+N\[con/-tra\ ]' wo '+ V  , N\[hum\]'ni'+N\[con/-tra\]'wo' + V  , N\[hum\]'ga'+N\[con/-tra\]'wo'+V , N\[hum\]'ga'+N\[con/-tra\]'wo'+N\[hum/-pro \]' ni '+ V  , N\[hum/-pro\]'wa'+N\[con/-tra\]'wo'+N\[h um\]'ni'+V  , etc . .
The first valency pattern in this list , for instance , specifies that the predicate V ( ' okuru ' ) can take one noun phrase consisting of a noun with the general semantic feature ' concrete '/ specific semantic feature non -' transport ' and 
F-word ' we'.
In this way the valency patterns summarize the basic J-word and F-word relationships  , and thus give the most essential information for inferring F-words from a given sequence of J -words  .

If necessary , certain modifications such as omission of the nominative case  , modification of the word sequence or of the F -words  , and addition of interrogative pronouns are carried out  . In dialogue sentences , the nominative case such as ' watashi ' ( T ) or ? anata ' ( ' you ' ) is seldom used ; hence , the nominative case is usually not included in the valency patterns  . To describe the modification of the two valency patterns for ' okur U '  ( ' send ' ) : N\[tingpro\]'madeni"+N\[con/-tra\]'wo'+V ( a ) N\[con/otra\]'wa'+N\[tim/pro\]'madeni'+V ( b ) If the noun N\[con/-tra\] of the valency pattern  ( a ) becomes the subjec % the F-word is replaced with ' wa ' and the word sequence is changed  , often resulting in the valency pattern ( b ) . Interrogative pronouns are added to produce valency patterns specific to interrogative sentences because a large number of questions occur in this task domain  . 
In a \] imited task domain , even individually optional cases behave in a similar way to the obligatory case for each predicate  . Therefore , the optional cases are described in these valency patterns  . When valency patterns were prepared for 65 words working as predicates , an average of about 11 valency patterns were produced for each predicate  . Details will discussed in
Chapter 5.
(2 ) Connection of two nouns by F-word'no " it is inferred that nouns which cannot be processed through valency patterns are likely to be connected with the F-word ' no '  ( roughly corresponding to ' of ' in English ) in the form ' A no B ' , where A and B denote nouns . For a given noun A , the other noun B can also be specified through the semantic features  . For instance , the noun'kaigr ( ' conference ' ) can be joined with other nouns as follows : ' kaigi'+'no'+N\[hum/hum\]  , ' kaigi'+"no'+N\[abs\] , ' kaigi'+'no '4 . N\[tim/tirn \] , ' kaigi'+'no'+N\[Iodins , pos\] , 
N\[abs\]+'no'+'kaigi',
N\[num/amo\]+"no'+'kaigi ', etc..
As shown above , whether or not to insert the F-word " no " is automatically determined by presetting which nouns are to be connected with the F-word " no '  . 
(3) Syntactic information
Pure syntactic knowledge is also useful in this process  . It is known that , in Japanese , no F-word can be attached to an adverb or a conjunction  , and that a verb in conditional form can be connected with an adjective via 
F-words such as ' ba'.
In addition , the following rules are used , for example : Continuative verb form + F-word + verb-->conjunctive particle'te '  , 
Conclusive verb form + F-word + verb - ~ conjunctive particle ' to '  , Continuative verb form + F-word + adjective - ~ conjunctive particle'te '  , conjunctive particle " temo ' , 
Attributive verb form + F-word+noun --7 no F-word , etc . .
4 . 2 Outline of the process of inferring F-words Figure  2   ( a ) illustrates a process of inferring F-words in a Japanese sentence : ' kaijyou-de kaigi-no yousu -worokuonshi-temoii  , desuka ' ,   ( May I record the speech of the conference at the hall ?  )  . 
In this case it is assumed that J-words'kaigi' , ' yousu ' , ' rokuonshi ' , and ' ii ' are correctly recognizable . 
The inference proceeds as follows : 1 ) syntactic information can connect'rokuonshi ' and ' ii ' with F-words ' te " or " temo ' and ' desuka ' to generate the phrases ' roku on shi-te ' or ' rokuonshi-temo ' and " ii  . desuka ' , '293 respectively ,  2 ) considering the semantic features of the first three J-words  , and taking the fourth J-word ' roku on suru ' as V , the valency pattern :
N\[Ioc\]'de '+ N\[act , abs\]'wo'+V , can be applied to them ,  3 ) there are two possible connections : ' kaigi-no yousu ' and ' kaijyou-nokaigi '  , and 4) considering both 2) and 3) together , sentences : ' k aij you-(de , no ) kaigi-no yousu-woroku on shi-(te , temo)ii-desuka ' , canfinally be derived . 
In a similar way ,   ( b ) shows how the following sentence is to be processed : ' genkou-waitsu-madeniokure  . bayor oshii-desuka ' , ( By what time may Isend the manuscript ?) . 
Here ,  1 ) ' okure ' is combined with ' yoroshii ' by the F -words'ha ' and ' desuka '  , to yield ' okure-bayor oshii-desuka ' ,  2 ) analyzing the semantic features of the nouns ' genkou ' and ' its u ' and the presence of the verb ' okuru '  , the following valency pattern is applied : N\ [ conl-tra\]'ha"+N\[timlpro\]'madeni'+V  . 
3 ) Since the nouns ' genkou ' and ' its u ' cannot be connected by the F-word " no '  ,  4 ) the following sentence : ' genkou-waitsu-madeni okure-bayor oshii-desuka '  , is finally obtained . 
5 An experiment to produce sentences from valency patterns Using the valency patterns obtained from collected dialogue sentences  , we carried out an experiment of producing sentences  . Of the total of 256 interrogative sentences , 146 were used in determining valency patterns . The number of verbs was 65 and that of nouns was 229  . In total , 669 valency patterns were prepared (10 . 7 patterns for each verb on the average ) . 
In addition to the collected dialogue sentences , we prepared 70 test questions . For these interrogative sentences , we carried out a sentence-producing experiment . The results of this experiment are shown in ( a ) Oriqinalu . tterance I'k aij you-de kaigi-no yousu-wo rokuonshi-te moii-desuka '  1 ~ F-word stJ~to be inferred Sequence of J -words correctly recoqnized noun'/noun'l noun  , verb adjective loclins ' acslsta ' , negative or conclusive ~ . . i i .   .   .   .   .   .   .  _'~__:  .   .   .   .   . _~_ : L__~___ . : ~ c ? = t~2u = J ~ E_ , etc .

For example , the number 7 shown for the first trial in the line corresponding to  5 candidate sentences means the number of candidate sentences was  5~ and that 7 of the 70 test sentences were correct ones . 
The lower half of Table 2 shows the number of test sentences in ' trials where no candidate sentence was produced or where none of the candidate sentences produced were correct  . 
The figures for the second and subsequent trials in Table  2 show the change ' in the correct answer rate when additional valency patterns were used to increase the incidence of correct sentences  . In this experiment , enough valency patterns were added soth ' at the sixth trial always produced correct sentences  . 
AI~elf the test sentences used in the above experiment were simple interrogative sentences  . As shown in Table 2 , tile Use of ~ alency patterns allows easy production of a complete sentence from a given sequence of J-words  . 
6 Inferring an omitted verb
The verb in a given sequence of J-words has an important role in this method because it allows the selection of a correct valency pattern  . It would he difficult to proceed by this method if the verb is omitted for some reason  , such as speech recognition failure , or if it were originally omitted as is of ten the case in Japanese dialogue  . 
However , in this restricted domain , nouns with particular semantic features are o ften related to particular verbs  . For example , as shown in Figure 3 , in sentences which contain a noun with the semantic feature of concrete/document  , he noun+F-word'wo'tends to be accompanied by the verb ' okuru '  ( ' send ' )  , ' kaku'('write')or'motsu'('have ') , and the noun+F-word'hi'tends to be accompanied by the verb'kinyuusuru '  ( 'enter' )  . 
This suggests the possibility of inferring an omitted verb from the nouns by inversely applying a suitable valency pattern  . In fact , the definition of a valency pattern can be generalized as follows : N\[semIgl semIs\]+  N\[sem2glsem2s \]-t . . . . + V\[v-class \] , where V\[v-class \] denotes a verb belonging to verb class'v-class '  . This valency pattern can be used to infer a verb V\[v-class\]associated with a set of nouns N\ [ semlglsemls\]  , 
N\[sem2 glsem2s \], etc..
This is schematically illustrated in Figure 4 . When there is a verb group A ( consisting of verbs which are inferred when a certain F-word is added to noun A  ) and a verb group B ( consisting of verbs which are inferred when a certain F-word is added to noun B  )  , the common area of these two groups indicates the verbs which are inferred from the valency pattern containing noun A and noun B  . 
For example , in a sentence which contains a noun'set sume is yo ' ~ erb'genkou ' ~ ~ ~  ) \[ concretel document " l ) ' tourokuyoushi'~~/erb ~ . . . . . . . \'' ~ shi ' Figure 3 Frequent combinations of r~ouns and verbs'temo to '\[ somontice oturo AJ/oncrete  , domeot ' WO ' ' ni ' ' aru ' a ' Figure 4 Verbs defined by multiple nouns with the semantic features of concrete/document and a noun with the semantic features of location/position  , verbs such as ' aru ' ( ' be ' ) and ' motsu ' ( ' have ' ) tend to be selected , and F-words specific to these verbs are chosen . 
Table 3 shows the number of verbs which are inferred from a given sequence of nouns using the valency patterns described in Chapter  5  . Since valency patterns were prepared for 65 verbs , the verbs are inferred-from these 65 . 
The columns in Table 3 Show the number of verbs inferred . The lines in the same tables how the number of nouns in the valency patterns  . For example , when the number of inferred verbs is 5 , there are 6 valency patterns where 5 verbs are inferred ; and of these 6 patterns 1 has one noun , 4 have 2 nouns , 1 has 3 nouns and none have 4 nouns . 
In counting the number of inferred verbs , only verbs having a valency pattern consistent with given valency patterns are counted  . When the noun of a valency pattern bears a specification as to the upper-level general semantic features but no specification as to the lower-task ~ dependent semantic features  , the verbs of the valency patterns bearing a specification as to the lower-evel semantic features are counted  . Conversely , for valency patterns where the lower-level semantic feature is specified  , the verbs bearing no specification as to the Iower  . -levei semantic features are not counted . For example , in the following two valency patterns , the  #erbs Vl and V2 are inferred from the pattern ( a )  , while only the verb V2 is inferred from the pattern ( b )  . 
N\[con\]+N\[Ioc\]+Vl(a)
N\[con/doc\]+N\[Ioc\]+V2(b)
As can be seen in Table 3 , only one verb was inferred in more than 50% of the valency patterns . Irl 90% of the remaining valency patterns where multiple verbs were in ~ erred  , the number c~f verb si~fe ~ rred was 6 o~le~s . ~ hese Table 3 Verbs inferred using valency patterns 1   2   3   4 Total 1   6   77   29   5   117   2   7   17   3   0   27   3   2   13   0   16   4   3   4   0   0   7   5   1   4   1   0   6   6   0   7   0   0   7   7   1   4   0   0   5   ,   .   . i 8 o 21 oo 2 -- i 9   0   0   0   0   0   10   2   1   0   0   3  =  11   2   0   0   0   2   12   2   1   0   0   3   16   1   0   0   0   1

7 Conclusions
As a first step toward a better interface between speech recognition and machine translation  , a method which is particularly useful for Japanese sentences was proposed to infer F-words for a given sequence of J-words  . 
In a restricted task domaia . , the most appropriate F-word can be inferred from a given sequence of J-words if the task-dependent semantic features of nouns are preset and the information of valency patterns is utilized  . 
In addition , the results of this study suggest that correct verbs can be inferred from valency patterns  . 
The authors are now evaluating the effectiveness of the procedures proposed in this paper by applying them to actual results of speech recognition  .
