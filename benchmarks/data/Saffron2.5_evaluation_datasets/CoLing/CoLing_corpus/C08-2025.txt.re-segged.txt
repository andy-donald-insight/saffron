Abstract
It is shown how weighted contextfree grammars can be used to recognize languages beyond their weak generative capacity by a one-step constant time extension of standard recognition algorithms.
1 Introduction
Weighted contextfree grammars ( WCFGs ) are used to disambiguate strings and thus filter out subsets of the tree languages of the underlying contextfree grammars ( CFGs ). Weights can either be used as probabilities , i.e . higher weights are preferred , or as penalities , i.e . lower weights are preferred . The first convention , also followed by Smith and Johnson (2007), is followed here . The subsets of the tree languages that consist of the heaviest tree for each yield are called the Viterbi tree languages . String languages are the yields of tree languages , and Viterbi string languages are the yields of Viterbi tree languages.
Infante-Lopez and de Rijke (2006) show that the Viterbi tree languages strictly extend the tree languages.
The idea explored in this paper is simple . If trees must have particular weights for their yields to be recognized , weights can be used to encode nonlocal dependencies . Technically , the { r n }- language is defined as all the strings for which the heaviest , i.e . most probable , tree has weight r i ? { r n }. It is shown that this class of languages includes common classes ? Thanks to Mark Hopkins , Daniel Quernheim and the anonymous reviewers for helpful comments.

of context-sensitive languages . In other words , standard Viterbi-style recognition algorithms for WCFGs can be used to recognize these classes by a one-step lookup that checks if the weight of the heaviest tree is in { r n }. We say that { r n }- languages are { r n }- recognized.
Sect . 1.1 presents formal preliminaries and a Viterbi-style recognition algorithm for WCFGs.
Note that for simplicity we restrict weights to be rational numbers.
Sect . 2 defines { r n }- languages and presents some examples of WCFGs that { r n }- recognize context-sensitive languages . Sect . 3 gives a rough characterization of the class of languages that can be { r n }- recognized by WCFGs.
Cortes and Mohri (2000) introduced a similar idea in the context of weighted finite-state automata ( WFSAs ) and showed that WFSAs can be used to { r n }- recognize contextfree languages . Their results are extended in Sect . 4. It is shown that WFSAs can also be used to { r n }- recognize context-sensitive languages . It is shown , however , that the non-context-free languages that can be { r n }- recognized by WCFGs strictly extend the non-context-free languages that can be { r n }- recognized by WFSAs.
Sect . 5 discusses a more exact characterization of the weak generative capacity of WCFGs in this view . Coprime WCFGs ( CWCFGs ), i.e . a subclass of WCFGs where the weights can be partitioned into reciprocal coprimes , are introduced . It is conjectured that the infinite hierarchy of k-CWCFGs is non-collapsing , and the classes of languages that can be { r n }- recognized by k-CWCFGs are characterized in terms of an untraditional modifi-1.1 Preliminaries A CFG is a 4-tuple G = ? N,T , P , S ? where N,T are finite and disjoint sets of nonterminal and terminal symbols , P a finite set of production rules of the form A ? ? where A ? N and ? ? ( N ? T )?, and S ? N is the start symbol . A WCFG is a 2-tuple G ? = ? G ,?? where G = ? N,T , P , S ? is a CFG and ? : P ? { m n | m ? Z + , n ?
Z + , m , n 6= 0} a ( total ) weight function.
A leftmost derivation t (?) for some CFG G = ? N,T , P , S ? is a sequence of production rules ? p m ? with 1 ? i ? m : p i ? P such that
S p m?1 p m =? ? ? is called the yield of t (?). The tree language T ( G ) is the set of all leftmost derivations licensed by the production rules of G . The string language of G is the set of yields:
L(G ) = {? | t (?) ? T ( G)}
The accumulated weight of a derivation of a string ? ?( t (?)) is the product of the weight of all the productions in t (?). The Viterbi tree language of a WCFG then is:
V ( G ) = { t (?) | t (?) ? arg max t ? (?)? T ( G ) (?( t ? (?)))} A simple Viterbi recognition algorithm for WCFGs is presented in Figure 1 for further reference.
2 Our extension
For a set of n many rational numbers { r n }, the language that is { r n }- recognized by the WCFG G , L { r n } ( G ), is defined:
L { r n } ( G ) = {? | t (?) ? V ( G ), ?( t (?)) ? { r n }} Call the class of all languages that can be { r n }- recognized by a WCFG for all finite and nonempty sets of rational numbers { r n } for balanced weighted contextfree languages ( BWCFLs ). In all our examples { r n } will be a singleton set.
Note that all there is needed to do to recognize the BWCFLs is to change line 7 of the Viterbi algorithm in Figure 1 to : if ( S , r i ) ? t(0, n ), r i ? { r n } then . . .
3 Bounds on weak generative capacity
The first result of this paper is the following : Theorem 3.1. The BWCFLs strictly extend the contextfree languages.
Proof . It is not difficult to see that any contextfree language is a BWCFL . Simply construct a WCFG
G = ? G ? , ?? for any CFG G ? = ? N,T , P , S ? such that the weight associated with each production rule in P is 1 { } ( G ) =
L(G ? ).
The other direction is not very difficult either.
It is shown that { anbncn | n ? 0}, which is non-context-free by the Bar-Hillel lemma , is a BWCFL . The language is , for instance , the set of strings L { } ( G ) for the WCFG G = ??{ S , S ? }, { a , b , c }, P , S ?, ?? where P is the following set of production rules , and ? assigns the weights in the left column to the items in the right column : : S ? Sc : S ? S ? : S ? ? aS?b : S ? ? ?
L { } = { a n b n c n | n ? 0}. Some example derivations are presented in Example 3.2.
Example 3.2. Consider the only and thus heaviest tree for abc , resp . ab:
S
Q
Q  
S
S ? b b " " a S ? ? b c
S
S ? b b " " a S ? ? b
The weight of the left tree , whose yield is abc , is 1
Consider also the {1 ?{ S,D , T , T ? }, { a , b , c , d }, P , S ? with production rules P : : S ? TD : D ? dD : D ? ? : T ? aTc : T ? T ? : T ? ? bT ? : T ? ? ? n ]) 1 for j ? 1 to n 2 do t(j ? 1, j )? {( A ,?) | A ? w j ? P , log(?(A ? w j )) = ?} 3 for k ? ( j ? 1) to 0 4 do t(k , j )? {( A ,? + ?) | A ? B ? P , log(?(A ? B )) = ?, ( B ,?) ? t(k , j ), if ( A ,? ? ) ? t(k , j ) then ? > ? ? } 5 for i ? ( j ? 2) to 0 6 do t(i , j )? {( A ,? + ? + ?) | A ? BC ? P , log(?(A ? BC )) = ?, ? k.(B ,?) ? t(i , k ), ( C , ?) ? t(k , j ), if ( A ,? ? ) ? t(i , j ) then ? > ? ? } 7 if ( S , r i ) ? t(0, n ) then return success else failure Figure 1: A Viterbi recognition algorithm for WCFGs It should be relatively easy to see that L(G ) = { a n b m c n d m | n ? 0}.
It is not difficult to see that the BWCFLs are a subset of the context-sensitive languages . This follows from the fact that the leftmost derivations in the Viterbi tree languages of WCFGs are linear in the length of the input string ; in other words , BWCFLs can be recognized in nondeterministic linear space and thus by a linear bounded automaton . Since any language that can be represented by a linear bounded automaton is context-sensitive , the BWCFLs must be a subset of the context-sensitive ones.
The set of BWCFLs is also a subset of the range concatenation languages ( Boullier , 1998) by the observation made in the introduction that they can be recognized in polynomial ( i.e . cubic ) time by standard algorithms and a one-step inspection of the weight of the heaviest tree ; and by the fact that the range concatenation languages are exactly the languages that can be recognized in polynomial time ( Boullier , 1998).
4 Weighted finite-state automata
Cortes and Mohri (2000) showed , in similar work , that WFSAs can be used to recognize contextfree , i.e . nonregular , languages.
Example 4.1. The weighted finite-state automaton T = ?{ q lowing ?- transitions {1
L { } ( T ) = { a n b n | n ? 0}: : ?( q ab , aabb , . . . have derivations with weights 1 whereas the string aab , for example , only has a derivation with weight 1 }, aab /?
L { } ( T ).
Cortes and Mohri (2000) also formulated an extension of WFSAs over cross-products of semirings that recognized certain context-sensitive , i.e . non-context-free languages , but their results can be considerably extended . The automaton in Example 4.2, for example , even recognizes a language conjectured to be outside the linear indexed languages , namely the MIX language ( Gazdar , 1988).
Example 4.2. The weighted finite-state automaton T = ?{ q with the following ?- transitions {1 the MIX language : : ?( q : ?( q that 8 ? 125 ? 729 = 903. The strings cab , bcabac , . . . have derivations with weights 1 since 903 8?125?729 = , whereas the string cababa , for instance , has no derivations with weight 1 string cababa has exactly one derivation whose weight is 903 ?125 .
5 Coprime WCFGs
A 2-CWCFG is a WCFG over subsets of the rational numbers C = { 1 n | n ? ?} ? { n { a n n k | n ? 0} X X
MIX X X { a n b m c n d m | m,n ? 0} X X { wcw | w ? { a , b } ? } X X
Figure 2: Classes of languages { r n }- recognized by WCFGs and recognized by the extension in Boullier (2000).
where ? is an arbitrary set of coprimes (? ? N ?) such that there is a bijection from the production rules onto themselves such that if a production rule has weight 1 erwise , i.e . if it has weight 1 m with m 6= 1 it is projected onto a production rule with weight m A k-CWCFG for k ? 1 is now the extension of CWCFG where the sets of production rules the product of whose weights is 1, can be of size at most k , e.g . the WFSA in Example 4.2 is a 3-
CWCFG.
The infinite hierarchy of k-CWCFGs seems to be non-collapsing . A k-CWCFG { r n }- recognizes the language { an n 2k | n ? 0}, but not { an n 2k+1 | n ? 0}. It has this property in common with k-multiple contextfree grammars ( Seki et al , 1991). 2-CWCFG can be shown to be weakly equivalent with the extension of linear indexed grammars ( LIGs ) ( Gazdar , 1988) where the stack is a multiset or a bag that is globally accessible and not just along spines . The universal recognition problem for this extension of LIGs can be shown to be NP-complete by reduction of the vertex cover problem , similar to S?gaard et al (2007).
The generalization to k-CWCFG requires stacks of stacks , but is otherwise relatively straightforward.
6 Conclusions
It was shown how weighted contextfree grammars can be used to recognize languages beyond their weak generative capacity by a one-step constant time extension of standard recognition algorithms.
The class of languages that can be recognized this way strictly extends the contextfree languages , but is included in the cubic time recognizable ones.
Boullier (2000) defines what he calls a ? cubic time extension of CFG ? that recognizes generalizations of the copy language that are beyond WCFG . It remains to be seen if the set of BWCFLs is a strict subset of the set of languages that can be recognized by this formalism . They all recognize the classes of languages in Figure 2.
