A comparison between the output fio in a set of duration rules based on Klatt  '76 and measure durations in a text allows quantificati  . on of speech rate at a local as well as a global level  . 
The rules account for knowo correlates of duration change  , such as Stl'e~s , phonetic and phrasal context , aud inherent differences in the durations of each segment  , but make no allow an ( e for local changes of rate within a text . The degree of fit of the OUtl ~ Ut from snch a system to the observed durations in tile text provides a guide both to the accuracy of Ille ruleset and totile rate-related variation within that text  . 
Statistic ~ l procedures can bc applied to reduce the rule-related error au  , l thereby strengthen both the predictions of the rules and the quantification of the rate variation  . This paper describc ~ research it \] progress . 
INTROI ) IJCTION
Speech late is known to be a variable affecting timing in a speech signal  , but one that is difficult to quantify . Absolutem casure . ~ , of duration in a text tell little about tile relative lengths  (  , fseglnents , and aceouut Inust be taken of all other factors involved if relative valn cs such as ' long '  , ' short ' , ' fast ' , or ' slow ' are to be applied . 
Simplel masures of speech rate , Sllchas ' words-per-lninutc' , and ' syllabics-per-second ' account well for variation at a global level  , blli : are inadequate to describe local changes in rate  , due to th c effects of differences in the structure of words and syllables ~ Words can be menu-up  p0Iy-syllabic/and syllables themselves can vary greatly in the nmn be r and type of segments occurring lU on set  , peak and codapositions . A measure of as nlall number of words or syllables  , expressed as a rate in counts per unit of t in , e , will be affected by the complexity of the compouent units  , structure of syllabics or syllabicity of words , such that a Stl'ing of simple units will yield a higher rate than the salne number of more COlnplex ones  . 
This eff~mt is reduced somewhat a stilenuln ber of milts increases and a Inure balanced distribution occl  . trs , bnt will always b , ; tlrescnt as a corrupting factor in the accuracy of the raten lc~lsurcment  . It is likely that text type , with stylistic differ cnc~zs in lexical choice , will be a strong determiner of ' rate ' in measnres such as these  , and a more text-independent method is rcqnired Segment ~: would seem to be a better unit for such measure l  , aent , batas yet there is uo satisfactory method of determining segmcnt boundaries for automated nmasurement  , and the lmin ber of decisious required for lneasurement by hand of a passage of text long enough to provide statistically adequate icsulls would bc both unecouomical nd error-prone  . 
Intile present study , a compromise is r cachcd in the choice of syllables as basic unit  , so boundary decisions arc reduced and enough measurements call be taken to allow statistically valid conclusions to be made  . A method of normalising for diff crenccs ill syllabic structure is proposed  . 
THEI)ATABASE
A database of five thousand syllables wits prepared fl'om recordings in tile SpokenEnglish Corpus  \[1\] which have been prosodically transcribed , tagged for part of speech and punctuated . The sew crcln casured for duration and transcribed l  ) honelnically . Salnples chosen wcr cone long text , at wenty-minute broadcast of a short story by Doris Lessing  , read by Elizabeth Bell , of apl 3 roximately four thousand sylhlbles , and two shorter texts of approximately five hundred syllables each  , one Open University lcctur conl ) hilosophy , and one news extract , for crosschecking . 
Sylhlbles were measured in millise conds from recordings digitisc dat  10k Hz ( 4 . 5k low pass filtered ) with the IBMUK SCSAY speech analyser\[2 ,   3\] using interactive graphic display at one-thousand sampl cs per screen-width  , and simultaneous auditory rc play of tile waveform  . Hard copy of both the waveform and gain plots were retained for reference purposes  . 
In the case of ambisyllabicity , the clcarcst boundary in tile acoustic waveform was selected  , and the phoimmic transcription , later to be used as input to tile rule system . 
marked accordingly.
FITTINGTHERULES ' The rules operate within the framework of a model of durational behaviour which statcs that  ( a ) each rule tries to effect a percentage increase or decrease in tile duration of a segment  , but ( b ) segments cannot be compressed shorter than a certain in inimum duration  . The model is summariscd by the for , nulaDUR =\[ ( INHDUR-MINDUR ) * PRCNT\]/100 + MINDUR where INHDUR is the inherent segment du , ' ation illlns , MINDUR is the minimuln duration of a segment if stressed and PRCNT is the percentage shortening determined by the rules  . '( D . H . Kiatt\[4\] ) An iterative process was used to match the nile set  ( originally designed for American English , based on the durations of a single male speaker , and takcnfi'omCVC words in fi'ame sentences uttered in a controlled environment  ) to the durations rcquired for the prediction of British English and for this particulars pcakcr -text pail '  . The phonemic transcription of tile test text was uscd as input to a computeri In pleinentation of segment values summed to the syllable level  . These were compared with the measure durations according to the factors underlying the rules  , which were in turn adjusted accordingly . 
The same input was passed through the improved rules and the process repeated until the output stabilised  . 
Segment durations were first adjusted , by sorting ' fit ' for each syllable , expressed as a percentage of predicted duration to observed  , by natu , ' e of the segments appearing . Thus , / t '/ for example , although assigned an inherent dn ration of 120ms and a minimum of 60ms in the Klatt rules , was found to be appearing in syllables that were consistently over predicted  , and by reducing its inherent duration in the rules to  95ms   , and its minimum to 50ms , a better overall fit was observed . An exact fit is not to be expected since the rules make no allowance for speech-rate variation  , other than offering a single variable ( ' PRC NT ' ) that can be reset to change the overall rate of duration  . The variance observed in the fit for any individual factor will never be reduced below the variance of the underlying speech rate changes  , but can only be minimiscd . 
The original rules assume that the minimum duration of an unstressed segm cut is half that of the segment in a stressed position  . On further analysis of segment fit according to stress  , it was fouud that a better prediction could be achieved by specifying absolute minima separately for the two situations  ; thus / k / for example , while 65ms and 50ms for inherent and minimtun in the Klatt rules , was found to fit better if specified as 65ms and 35ms   , with an absolute minimum ( for the unstressed position ) of 15ms . The full table of final values with the original defaults is shown in Fig  1  . These represent an intermediate stage in an iterative process  , and arc not presented as statements about individual segment durations per se  . 
With these segment defaults fitted to the sample text  , the wdues specified in the rules for modifying PRCNT were similarly adjnsted so that the best fit could be obtained  . In summary , clause and phrase medial syllables were found to be ovcr predicted  , and both initial and final syllables under predicted  ; clause final syllables considerably so . An extra rule was included to cover the case of phrase-initial syllables  , which are not accessible through the framework of the original rules  \[6\]  . 
QUANTIFYING SPEECH-RATE
With the rules matched to the text at a global level through statistical analysis of averaged results  , differences in output can be examined at the local level  . Since there is no speech-rate information in the rule set  , differences will contain a quantification this , contaminated by noise from measurement and prediction error  . 
There will inevitably be a certain amount of error in hand-measurement of several thousand syllables  , no matter how precise the equipment , but since the totals are cumulative , and sums can be simply checked against overall durations for stretches of the text  , it can be assumed that the majority of errors , will lie in boundary determination . These can be overcome by smoothing with a three -syllable moving -  . average window since any over - or under -measurement in an individual syllable should be compensated by a corresponding under - or over -measurement of its immediate neighbours  . 
Errors in prediction will be systematic by definition  , and therefore susceptible to detection by statistical methods  .

can be determined by examining the measures of t it according to criteria not included in the ruleset and implementing new rules to cover any regularities found  . 
The quantification of speech-rate is thus not a single  , simple process , but an iterative one , with accuracy ( and therefore confidence ) increasing at each iteration . It can be expressed as a ratio ( ' SPRATE ' ) of predicted rate in syllables/second to observed rate in syllables/second calculated from smoothed data  . The above objection to syllables per second as a measure of speech-rate is overcome by comparing like with like m the present method  . Thus
SPRATE (%) = ( SMOOTHED PREDICTED
RATE/SMOOTHED OBSERVED RATE )* 100
PRELIMINARY RESULTS
At the current iteration , sprate mean is 100 . 2% for 3959 syllables\[7\] , indicating an almost exact over all fit between tile predicted and observed durations  , but with a standard deviation of 19 . 1 8 that is partly accounted for by the lack of rate information  . Of the other factors contributing to this variation  , no significant effects could be found for e . g . the type of syllable structure , the position of the syllable in the word , or the position of that word in the phrase or clause  . Part of speech , however , appeared to be a significant factor , with sprate results for selected categories as below  , syllable type means . d . ( cst ) n lexical verbs 102 . 7 0 . 7626 nouns 98 . 5 1 . 0750 adjectives 92 . 9 1 . 2339 adverbs 102 . 6 1 . 6  184 which shows that while verbs and adverbs are slightly over predicted by the rules  , nouns and especially adjectives rtllcs prodet . 
Ancarlie . " iteration she wed that polysyllabicity , instead of being in lllc domain of the word as the original rules In'edict  , gives a better fit if measured in feet , and adjustments made according to the number of the unstressed syllables that follow each stresl : cd syllable  . 
A category that needs further examination is that of stressed bttl mmcc cn led syllables which are ' prominent but have no pitch movement '  \[8\]  . By default , these are treated as stressed , but on examinalion of the results , sprate , which is 100 . 3 for unshessed syllables and 98 . 3 for stressed , is 106 . 7 for stress cd-lmt-unaccented , showing slight under prediction of stressed syllables  , but greal clov cr predielion of the intermed i ~ , tc category . 
Of perhaps greater interest hough , is the fit of sprate to the perceived speeding up and slowing down in the presentation of the texi : by tile reader  . Taking tile means prate values for all syllabl ( s in the tone-group , we find the following 93 . 9 Walking down the path with her , heblurted out 112 . 1 ' i'd like to go and have a look at those rocks down there  .

where an increased sprate indicates over prediction itile rules or  , conversely , a speeding up in the text . Iiere , examples have had to bcchosen to include text tml cluest otherate  , but listening to longer passages confirms that rate correlates well with sprale  . Further iterations will allow more confident examination at levels lower than tile sentence  . 

As Fig 2 . suggests , a small random or high frequency error summed with a more slowly changing effect does little to hide its rhythms  . Speech rate cannot be expressed as a simple sine wave  , but its effect on the prediction of segment duration by rule cantmrhaps be seen in this way and nntil its processes are understood  , no predicted durations can match observations from a real text-the lows cannot be slow enough nor the high slast enoul  ; h . Until rate information is super imposed on

The above method provides a quantification of speech rate that reveals both local and wider -range domains  . Being an iterative process , it provides for an imt ) rovement of the rules for prediction of dm'ation in a text while at the same time revealing processes within the text that govern changes in rate at then mrelocal level  .
