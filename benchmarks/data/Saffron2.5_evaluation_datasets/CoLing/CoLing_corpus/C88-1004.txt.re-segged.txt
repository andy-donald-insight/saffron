Ta . ~ p~esant paper tries to outll n ~ a model to ~ nhanc~tiletrm~sfer control within the N~T  ; d . Machine Translation , System . The model is being currently tested Anth ~~ srman-Spanish system which is under development in Barcelona and relies upon techniques belonging to the GPSG framework  . The central idea is to extract from the transfer part of th  , ~ phrase structure rules currently used by METAL all the  :4elevant generalizable information about feature traffic and control dependences  , and put at in form of language-dependent tables . This infomnatic n is then accessed and h~mdled by a few high-level rule operators  , called during th , ~transfe ~ process , implementing three general feature pz:~nciples . The grammar writer is thereby relieved from the to dinus task of controlling all the feature traffic between nodes  , this resulting in a clea~er , shorter and safer grab , mr for the system . 
L-Introduction ? ~2h\[spaper , presents a proposal for the application of so ~ e G~3G-based teclu * i qees on the ~ . ~ TAL~I'?syst ~ , ~ ~ ith the ai ~ lofen do wing the systea with a stzonge ~ control in the ~ irans f ~ rPhase  . 
% % 8 ce ~ tral idea upon which this Yrm~s fer Control , Lodel is eased is to provide the grmmn arw ~' ite ~ with at ~  . oufo~tabls and safe means fez'keeping as much feature traffic as possible cont ~ olled in the Transfer Phase of the t ~ anslatioa process in MET Al  ,  . Currently , any kind of feature traffic between nodes must be explicitely stated in the ~' ules  , and the same happens ~ ith the ck ~ ild node t_ ~ansfe ~ ~ t'ocess  ( Control Dependences )  . 
\[ ( t seems reasonable to think that a great deal of bot ~  . ~ this feature traffic between nodes and the control dependences with ~ uthet ~ ansfer phase could be generalized ~ ud ~: tated outside the rifles  , in form of lan~age-dependent tables which would the ~ be accessed by a few general operato ~ called in the rtiles  ( implementing the principles proposed l : elow )  . The gram ~ m ~ ~ riter would thus be relieved fi'e . ~ thi ~' , task , all this result in giusho~ter , clearer and lesse ~ e ~' p ~ one rules . 
~ ost of the ideas conforming the model presented he ~: ~ have be ~ a~t ~ keuf ~: om the ~ PSG framework\[Gazda ~  85\]  . 
The original idea was to directly apply the & ~ SG principles I  ; othe syste ~ b since , basically , ME '2 ~ , disposes of the necessary structure for it ( i . e . , it is a PS-based systen b and thus , it works with struct u ~ . ald~scriptions\[trees\]consisting of bundles offeatu ~ e ~ value pai~s\[nodes\]  )  . 
However , the fact that the GPSG model was originally conceived for analysis  ( transfer being quite a different problem ) and that METAL lacks mechanisms which are central to the GPSG model  , like LP/ID ~ ules , metarules , FSD and FCR , etc . , showed the unpracticability of such a direct appruach  . 
This is why the idea became to adapts om ~ 0? the ideas offered by the GPSG ( mostly the CAP and the HFC universal feature inst ~tiatio a principle ~  ) and we ~ fo~mulate th ~ so that they can be us ~! d fez  0an purposes . 
2.-Fundmnentals of the NtETAL systet , .
METAL is a Cha~t'o par~er Hdrivan Phi:ass Stru ( : tuz'ebased MT system , which reflects the classic MT scheme o~f Analysis  , Transfer and Generation phases . During the Analysis Phase , METAL builds from each input sou : , :' ceimls usse sentence one or more structural descriptions henceforth trees  )  , consisting of nodes , which in turn consist of a number of Feature -Value pairs  ( henceforth f~v-pairs )  , ) in the Transfer Phase , the trees obtained in the analysis are converted into equivalent trees adapted to the target language needs  . After this , the Generation Phase genes ' stem the output sentence/s in the target language  , using the transfer trees as input . 
A pa~-t from the lexical DBs METAL has some 500 PS rules , whose form can roughly be described as follows :
NODE-STRUCTURE < e.g,"NP-->DETNO ">
TEST < Tests on nodes to be satisfied in order for the rule to apply > CONSTR < Analysis-Tree Construction part > ~ NALY SISP ARTINTEGR < Anaphora Resolution part > TRANS FER PART TRANS FER < Transfer-Tree construction part > During the Analysis phase  , only the analysis part of the succeeding rules apply  , building the analysis tree in a bottom-up manner until a S node is reached  . Once the analysis tree has been thus built , the Transfer Phase starts ; the transfer part of the rules applied during analysis activates now  , climbing down the tree from top to bottom until the terminal nodes are transferred  . When the Transfer Process applies on a node N , with f-v-pairs F-V , the child nodes of N are also transferred ( and the child nodes of these , and so on , until terminal nodes are reached ) . Once all the branching nodes dominated by N have been transferred  , the transfer process returns control to the father of N  , which now bears target-language updated f-v-pairs F-V '  . 
Two tasks central to the Transfer Process are the Feature Traffic  ( i . e . ,  , hichf-v-pairs need to be sent up and down in which moment  , and from which node to which node/s ) , and the handling of Control Dependences ( i . e . , which child node of one analysis tree or sub -trme \[ henceforth local tree \] must be transferred first  , in order for other slbling nodes to be able to be rightly transferred  )  . 
The two mentioned tasks ere now handled by the Grammar writer in the Transfer part of the t~TAL Grammar Rules through calls to " low level " feature traffic operators  ( i . e . , copy one or more f-v-pairs from the root node to a child node  , from one child node to another sibling node , or from one child node to the root node ) . 
What the present Transfer Control Model proposes is to extract from the rules ell which can be generalizable in this process regarding feature traffic and control dependences end carry it out through calls to a few " high level " operators which use information stored in the syst ~ database in form of tables stating which f-v -pairs must be present in a given node  , which nodes are controllers , end which other nodes are o ontrollees within a given local tree  . 
3.- Basic Definitions.
In this section there follows a number of definitions which will be used throughout the rest of the paper  . 
3.1.-Local tree.
A local tree is a part of a structural description which is currently being dealt with by the particular rule which is under consideration  . For example , given an analysis tree of the form
CLS\[I\]/\
DETNO\[2\]/\
ADJN013\]/\
NSTN-FLEX in which the number between \[\] indicates  ( for reference ) the rule which has built this particular node , the local tree when rule \[2\] is applied would be :/ No2\] 
ADONO\[3 ) whereas the local tree for rule \[3\] would be / Nof3I   . 
NSTN-FLEX 3.2.-Types of nodes
RootNode\[RN\]:*Theroot\[parent\]node of a local tree  . 
HeadNode\[HN\]:*In case Control Dependences ( see below ) exist within the current local tree , the HeadNode is the controller node . Otherwise , the HeadNode must be egplicitely stated for each particular tree structure  , normally being the X(BAR-I ) child node , in a local treed ~ inated by a root node X ( BAR ) Notice that this definition of Head Node has been tailored adhoc for this model end deviates considerably fro ~ the traditional notion of Head in the Xbar theory  , for instance . 
Dependent Node \[ DN\]:
A child node of the local tree which is control led by a ~  , 
FreeNode\[FN\]:
A child node of the local tree which is not controlled by any HN  . 

Lexieal Node \[ LN\]:
Att ~ rain a lexical node.
3 ? 3-Type,~of Features
Head Featlwes\[HF\]:*As ~ to ff-v-pairs which must be present with the some values both in the Bead Node and in the Boot Node in some precise moment a during the Translation 

Lexical Access Features\[LAF\]:*All~t off-v -pairs Which must be present in the Lex/Lcal Nodes nodes prior to their transference into the target language  . 
Control Features\[CF\]:*A sect off-v -pairs which must be copied from the Bead Nodes into the Dependent Node/s after the Head Nod ~ has been transferred and before the Dependent 
N ~ le/ais/are transferred.
3 . 4  . -Central Dependence Between Nodes * AH ~ ad Node\[HN\]controls one or more Dependant NC~J ~/ S\[DN\] within a local tree if in order for the  DN/4 to be properly transferred , It/they must have a set off-v-pairs whose particular values are to be updated with those values borne by the HN after this  n~i~3 has been transferred . 
Bad : really , our notion of Control coincides with the one given by the GKPS\[Gazder  85  \ ]  . Control is a language-dependent relationship between nodes  , in which there is a controller node and one or more contgullee node/s  , which ultimately subsumes the concept of agreement  ( subject-predicate , noun-adjective , etc . ) . In the Transfer Process , nodes which are controllers must be transferred prior to their controlle as  , in order to ensure the right agreement b~tween them in the target language  . 
Not: . ~ cs that a local tree may present different types of Controll ~ pendences  ( see Fig . I ) , with one Dependent Node ( the NP\[2\]z ~ ode below , dominating a local tree where the NO node contro J  . s the DET node for Gender and Number ) , with two Dependent Nodes ( the CLS node dominating a local tree where the NP \[$ SUBJ\]controls both the PRED node for Person and Num Ser and the ~ DJ node for Gender and Number  )  , or no Dependent Nodes at all ( the PP node dominating a local , tree where neitht , r the NP node nor the PREP nodes control each other  )  :

Fig . l : Control Dependences 3 . 5 . -Local Transfer Process Given a local tree , consisting of a Root Node a . 
one or more child nodes ( including a Bead Node , and possibly one or more Dependent Nodes , and one or more Free Nodes ) , we can split the local Transfer Process sequence of the Root Node dominating the local tree into three steps : * Transfer the Bead Node  . 
* Copying the Control Features ( CFs ) set from the already transferred Head Node into the Dependent 
Node/s if any).
* Transfer the Dependent Node/s , and the Free Node/s ( if any ) . 
4 . -General Information to be Supplied to the System DB Basically  , three types of information must be stored into the system DB end used later on by the Transfer Process  . Physically , this information is implemented in form of a LISP list  , although this is purely a parochial progra ~ ing decision  . 
4 . 1 . -HEAD Feature List\[HFL\]:It contains information stating which f-v-pairs are cons idered to be members of the set HEAD  . The decision of which f-v-pairm must be HF?D members is crucial to the model  . In a first approach , we will adopt a pragmatical criterion . This means that we will include as HEAD features those f-v-pairs which are current lypercolated in the corresponding gules  , and which we make sure are actually needed for the Transfer Process  . 
However , the aim is to extrapolate from this first approach a  ( may be language-dependent ) theoretical hypothesis about HEAD Features which enables to state a general criterion to es tablish the HF membership  . 
21 4 . 2 . -Lcxieal Access Table LkT\]:It contains L ~/ ~ GUAGE-DEPENDENT information stating which sets off-v-pairs  ( Lsxical Access Features \[ LAF\] ) are needed in order for each ( major ) Lexlcal Node to be rightly transferred . XnMETAL , Isxical nodes are transferred by calling the XLX operator in the TRANSFER p~rt of the corresponding rules  . XLX takes ar~t ' ~ ents specifying the needed target lan@uage stem retrieval information for a given category  , whether an inflsxion must be attached to the stem  , and the retrieval information for this inflsxion . 
Thus , the LAT table contains information about Lexical % Access Features  , Inflexion Attachement infoz ~ at in n ( when needed ) and Inflection Lexical Access Features ( ILAF )  . In fact , this would be quite similar to the NLX table proposed by Tommy Loomis in\[Loom is  87\]  . 
Here is a schematic example of the Lexical Access Table: 
SPANISII-LAT :
LN!LA ~'! INF ! ILAF ! . . . . . . . . +  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  +  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  +  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . +

NU=Number
In the case of VST , fo ~ instance , the ~ AT would indicate that , for Spanish , a Verb Stem ( VST ) Lexical Node must be accessed in the target monolingual lexicon database through the current values of the MD  , NU , PF , Pg and TN features as keys , that a V-FLEX inflexion must bs attached to it , and that this inflexion should be accessed through the current values of CL  , MD , NO , PF , PS , TN . 
4~3 . -Control Type Table\[CI~\]:This tab le contains  LAN~3AG~-~DEPENDENT information stating the Control Dependences for different local trees dominated by different Root Nodes  . In this table , for each possible Root Node category ( RN ) , its corresponding Head Node ( HN ) , Dependent Nods / 8 ( D N ) and Control Features ( CF )  , if any , are specified . 
Here is one example of three CTT entries , one for CLS ~ , ( with two potential Control Dependences ) , one for ~- ( one CD ) and one for PP- ( no CDS ) dominated local trees :

CLS=Clause NP=Noun Phrase ( BAR2)
PROD=Predicate $ SUBJ--SUBJECT value of feature ~ OLDET = Determiner NO=NounPhrase  ( B  ~ RI ) 
ADJ = Adjective GD = Gender
NU ' ~= Number PS = Person ~ m first entry specifies that  , given a local tree with a CLS root nods , its child Head Nods ( HN ) is the N~child node bearing the SSUBJ value for the feature ROL  , whereas the PPJZD child node always is a dependent node  . The control features ( CF ) relevant for this structure are ~ IU ( number ) and PS ( person )  . Moreover , a sibling ADJ node may also be a Dependent Node , with control features GD ( Gender ) and NU ( Number )  . This CTT entry controls the subject-predicate , and the subject-predl cative adjective ( in copulative sentences ) agreement requirements , respectively . 
The same should be stated for each gra~mmtical category which may be a Root Node Of a local tree  ( CLS , 
PRED , NO , etc.).
% ~ othings must be stressed about the CTT table : * Information about particular feature values can be given to distinguish between sategorins with the same n~s  ( for instance , to ensure that for the subject-predicate agreement  , the controller is the ~ which bears the role of SUBJect  , and not some other sibling ~) . 
* Each CTT entry must have at lea~t a Head Node specified for each Root Node  , and possibly on snzmor ~ Dependent Nodes , which may or may not be obligatory , with their corresponding control features . This accounts fo ~: the possibility of having different local trees dominated by the same Root Node categoz T  ( the case of CLS , above ) .

An tm ~ erOf questions still rm ~ a ~ , o ~) en ,   na~0ely : * How to deal with trees where Control Interdependences exist  . This is the case of German 1~s bearing different adjeotlval inflexions depending both upon the gender of the noun and upon the type of determiner  ( weak/strong adjective declension ) How to deal with local trees with more than am ; UeadNode ( coordinate structures , for ~ mtanee ) . 
* Whethe~some type of GPSG FCR-or/and FSD-like mechanisms  ( see GK~S\[Gamdar85\] ) could be u~ed Jn this model . 
* Whether this model is generalizable to other MT systems  . 
The outlined model may be a starting point to begil ~ introducing sane of the techniques offered by the current linguiatiutheories  ( ? ~ SG , LFG , GB , etc . ) into the MY field , and at the same time t ~ ying to b ~ ing these pure theoretical models into the practical fields of NT sy~it <~ s already under dev Blopment  .
