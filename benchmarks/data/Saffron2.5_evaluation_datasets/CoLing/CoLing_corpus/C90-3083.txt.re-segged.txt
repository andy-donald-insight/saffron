Abstract
In a natural dialogue , there are many disturbances in the context level because of interruptions and inserted sentences  . In spite of such phenomena , cohesion is a very important idea for understanding the context correctly  . 
In our approach , cohesive knowledge which judges cohesion between sentences is given to the system and then the knowledge is used to find cohesion in d is arranged context  . It is also applied to interpret anaphora , ellipsis and proforms in the context . In order to do so , we define the knowledge and use its definition to abstract knowledge fl'om a linguistics database almost automatically  . 
1. Introduction
When we build a machine translation system for dialogues  , we must face a lot of contextual-phenomena such as ellipses  , anaphor as and proforms . In a dialogue these phenomen are more complicated because of many disturbance such as interruptions  , inserted sentences and utteranced is order . The phenomena have not been treated on the computer though these phenomena influence the context-dependent problems such as ellipses  , anaphoras , proforms and referent-transfers . In this paper , we propose a context processing mechanism which fits for the disarranged phenomena  , and describe the linguistic knowledge , called " local cohesive knowledge " , which is a constraint for grasping the contextual relationship  . 
In Section 2 we will give examples which arc dependent on the context and then describe the cause of difficulty in processing them  . In Section 3 we propose " local cohesive knowledge " and apply the mechanism in a dialogue-machine translation system in Section  4  . 
2 . Contextual Robustness in l ) ialogues Context-depcndent problems such as ellipses  , anaphoras , proforms and referent-transfers , present complications as shown in Figure 1 . 
(1 ) Anaphora : the previous utterance is the same , however , " it " points to the different terms , " the registration fee " in Example ( 1 ) and " the conference " in Example ( 2 )  . Therefore context is complicated . In Example 1 , the sequences of questions are disordered . In Example 2 , the answer is a negation for the sentence , "I would like . . . " . 
(2) Ellipsis ' . in Example 3 , there is an ellipsis in a Japanese sentence , (2) " mottein ai node suga . " The

S . dollars ) de ( in ) ~' , q i s h i ? n a : s ~ ( prg-\['orm=Wc\[=We would like you to pay in US  . do Ilars , \] Figure 1 Examples of contextual phenomena , ellipsis depends on the context and means ' credit card '  ; it is both a focus and an object ( OBJ ) . 
(3) Pro-form : in Example 4(2) , " one gaishimasu " is a proform and means ' We would like you to pay ' in Japanese  . 
The meaning is dependent on the context.
We call processing the disarranged phenomena" contextual robustness ! ~"  . In order to process such phenomena , it is necessary to understand cohesion in a context correctly  . 
3. l , oe alcohesive knowledge
We define cohesion in the view of computational linguistics  . He recohesion regulates whether two sentences are connected or not  . However it does not regulate a relationship between two sentences  . That is , cohesion is a constraint for two sentences . 
\[ The definition of " local cohesive knowledge " \] In our approach  , " cohesion " is grasped in a context with " local cohesive knowledge "  . It includes not only the constraints tbr " local cohesioW ~" but also its results such as interpretations of ellipses  , anaphoras , proforms and referent-transfers . The refm'e if constraints are satisfied , the interpretations are obtained . Therefore " local cohesive knowledge " has two parts  , " constraints for cohesion " and " interpretations "  , as follows . 
(Constraints for local cohesion )  = >  ( interpretation ) tl . Ordinarily , robustness means an ungrammatically sentence . 
I lowevm '" contextual robustness " is used for the discourse level  . 
t2 . We treat the contextual phenomena which occur locally  , thus we use the term , " localcehcsion " . 
1391\[Constraints\]
The constraints are described as follows.
verbl < X1, Y1, Z1>, verb2 < X2, Y2, Z2>.
In the " verb l < Xl .   , Y 1 , Zl > " , " XI " , "YI " and " ZI " means the case elements of " verb1"  ; subjective ( SUBJ ) , objective ( OSJ ) and second objective ( oBJ g ) cases . If two sentences are satisfied with these constraints  , they are called " local cohesion " here . As shown in Figure 2 , there are 18 types , determined by three constraints for verbs and six constraints for nouns  . 
Type h the same verbs and the same nouns.
For example , " Could you send meapaper ?""\[ sent you the paper yesterday  . " Both of the verbs in the question sentence and the answer sentence are the same words  , " send " . Also , its object is the same word , " paper " . This constraint is described as follows . 
send < Xl , paper , Z1>, send < X2, paper , Z2>.
This constraint means that if two sentences include " send " and its object  , " paper " , the sentences are cohesive . 
Therefore the following sentences are cohesive because they satisfy the same constraint  . 
For example , "May Isendyou a paper to your office ?"" P leases end me the paper to my home address  . "send<Xl , paper , ZI >, send < X2, paper , Z2> .

4 . Context proeessing with local eo hesive knowledge I will now explain the mechanism which is useful for " contextual robustness "  , and interpret contextual phenomena such as anaphoras  , ellipses and proforms . A flow of the system is shown in Figure 4 . Inputted sentences are analyzed with grammar ules and lexicons  , based on Lexica L functional Grammar ( LFG ) (1) , and then intermediate representations ( F-structures of LFG ) are obtained . An intermediate representation is converted into its skeleton  , because it has too much information to process for a context  , in Figure 5 . It is used to unify with " local cohesive knowledge " in the context processing  . 
The algorithm of the context processing mechan is misas follows  . 
(1 ) Make a pair of skeletons : to check the local cohesion  , bring the skeletons of the previous utterance and make a pair of skeletons  . 
(2 ) Check the local cohesion : lookup the table of " local cohesive knowledge " as a key of the pair of skeletons  . If the pair satisfies the constraints of " local cohesive knowledge "  , the pair is cohesive and then the

5. The experiment
When we built the system , one of the most important problems was how to produce the knowledge  . We defined the local cohesive knowledge and used its definition to extract knowledge from al inguistics database almost automatically  . 
We have a linguistic database which includes 60 keyboard dialogues . The dialogues include 70 , 0 00 words in total and the number of different words is more than  3000  . These dialogues are analyzed and managed by al inguistic database  ( P- )  . 
We extracted local cohesive knowledge from 60 dialogues which include 350 verbs and 1000 nouns . First we made a table which includes each verb and its noun  . 
Then we extracted constraints of local cohesive knowledge to make the pair from the table  . Constraint pattern ( a ) , a : ! ~ shown in Figure 3 , was obtained automatically from the data and patterns  ( b ) and ( e ) were generated from pattern ( a )  . We obtained 24531 assertions of " local cohesive knowledge " for types  1  , 2 and 3 , and 651 a . , . ; : sertions of " local cohesive knowledge " for t . ypes 7 , 8 and 9 , We have learned that local cohesive knowledge is very sparse  . Therefore the volume of " local cohesive kzmwledge " is not a problem  . 
We have implemented the fi'amework as a module of ai  ( 1" Isle . eletml ) = ; (1) skeint on ii if lIqUiD ; = ' to il < l ' ; SUB , I ; , , f OBJ 2i , ( f ,  .

context process in a dialogue machine translation system  . 
The system is built on a Lt?G based machine translation system  ( 3 )  . It has 200 gramma rules and more than 3000 words . It transfers Japanese sentences into English ones . 
It was implemented in Quintus Prologona SUN-4 system and its program size was 3  . 4MB . 
An example is shown in Figure 5.
(1 ) kurejit tokaado ( credit card ) no ( of ) namae ( name ) o ( OBJ ) oshiete ku dasai ( Could you tell )  . 
\[= Could you tell me the name of credit card .  9\]  ( 2 ) motte ( have ) in ai ( not ) nodes uga ( copula )  . 
\[=1 don't have a credit card . \] in the sentence (2) there is an ellipsis . It means " kurejit to kaado ( credit card)" . It points to the modifier in the previous entence  , " kurejittokaa dononamae ( name of credit card ) " . In this approach , as a results of analysis , the skeletons of two sentences are obtained as shown in Figure  5  . The pair of skeletons are satisfied with the local cohesive knowledge  ( c ) in Figure 5 . Then the ellipsis is obtained as a ' credit card ' . 
6. CONCI:USIONS
To build a " contextual robustness " system , we proposed a context-processing mechanism which analyzed the context with " local cohesive knowledge "  . In order to apply the model into a machine -translation system  , the knowledge needs to be produced effectively . Therefore we defined 18 types of " local cohesive knowledge " and used this definition to abstract knowledge from a linguistics database almost automatically  . Some of the 18 types were implemented on a machine translation system  . The other types were not generated , because they includes synonyms . Inl , he future , we will construe them with a thesaurus and also extend the context processing algorithm to process more complicated phenomena such as parallel phrases  .
