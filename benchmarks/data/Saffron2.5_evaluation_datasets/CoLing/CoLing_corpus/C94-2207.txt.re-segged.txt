This paper introduces a semantic theory I ) I , PW , l ) ynamicl , ogic with Possible World , which extends Groenen dijk's I)PI , and Cress well's Indices Semantics . The semantics can interpret the temporal and modal sense and anaphora  .

? 1 Introduction
At present here are three main aspects in semantical field :  1  . Transformation of ' sentences or discourses into formulas in high order logic  . 
2 . Semantic interpretation of the logical formulas . 
3. Semantic ambiguity.
This paper presents the semantics , dynamic logic with possible world , which combines DPIJ 3~ with Indices semantics r ' ~ and extends the theories  , the theory can be used to interpret the temporal and modal sense and anaphoric connection  . For the limitation of space we only give the definitions and examples concerned rather than present a formalization which should inc-lude the axioms and rules concerned like u 
I ) pLTM
Following Montague semantics , the discussion on meaning of a sentence started with predicate formula  , high order logical formual with lambda terms , which is translated from a sentence S by means of a set of rules and reduced to a frstorder predicate formula A finally  . 
Problem = given an expression A , meani-ngEA ~= ? Assume that a model M is an ordered pair  ( D , F ) where D is a domain , a nonempty set and F an interpretation function assigning a semantic value to each non-logica l constant of the language  . A value assignment g is a function assigning a member of D to each variable of the language  . W is a possible world . The inten-sion of the expression A is Int\['A~--- -- IIAIIM *  . The extension of the expression A is ExtEA , W \] = IntEA\](W ) = IIAII .   .   .   .   .   . 
Some semantic evaluations are as follows :
I . Montague Semantics , given M , W , evaluates extension IIAIIM'W'~ . 
2 . Possible World Semantics ( M . J . Cre-sswell ) , given M , W , finds the set of possible worlds which satisfy the extension of h  . i . e . , Wl\[lAl\[M'W ~-= True . 
3 . I ) ynamic Predicate I , ogic(J . Groenendi-jk ) , given M , W , finds dynamic changes between the value assignments : \] lAll ~' W =  ( g  ~ . , , go , , tS . 
4 . Dynamic Logic with Possible World , given M , finds dynamic changes between the ordered pairs of value assignment and world : IIAIIu = : rt  ( G  ~ , , , G , ,~lG , ~ = ( gi ~ , W  ~ , , , ( L , ,= < g . . . . w,,o0 . 
The evaluations 1 ,   2 above are in static sense and for use of interpretation of sentences without anaphora  , while evalu-use of interpretation of anaphoric connection  . 
?2DLPW , Anaphoric Connection
In this section we hope that DLP W can offer a successful application to anaphoric connection like the intepretation of the famous donkey sentence in Groenen dijk's 
DPLTM . The sentence (1) There was a key , it is lost . 
can be formalized as ( 2 ) P-~key ( x ) & NOW lost ( x )   ( in the hope that ) having the same semantic interpretation as the formula  ( 3 ) PB  ~ ( key ( x ) & NOW lost ( x ) ) . 
The idea will come true by means of dynamic logic DLPW  . A state , denoted by n(=<a , g )) , may be a pair of a sequence of time a(a = - a(O ) , a (1)) and a value assignment g . 
There are revisions of semantic de-finitons of operators concerned  .

(8) II0(x ) ll=<~,,~DI~,=~, g~=g2,g,(x ) ~ F(ep) . 
Where F ( ~0) is a set of individuals , F is the function in a model M . p is an atomic formula . Here obviously , conjunction is treated like composition ( i . e . , compound statement S ~, S ~) . Intuitively , the conjunction is treated in the sequential sense  . 
The meanings of the formulas a , \[ l/0\] , ? l\[termt/0\] , g , \[ x \] follow the statements in the preceding section  . 
Assume that initially for all i , j , ai(j)~t0 and a ~ , gi in n ~ denoted components concerned . Hence (9) < n , , nD~il(2)li iff , by (6) , for some n3 , n3' , g . ~( = g s '), ( lO)(n ~, n . Oell P_~key(x ) ll and (11) < ns' , n2) ~ liNOW lost(x ) ii . 
(10) holds iff , by (5) , for some t(<al(0)) , (12) (( al\[termt/0J , g ) , n ~) ~\]\] ~ x key(x ) iP iff , by (7) , for some h(=g , \[x\]) , (13) (( a , \[termt/0\] , gl\[x\]) , 7 ~) et lkey(x ) Hiff , by (8) , (14) ns = < a , \[termt/O\] , g , \[x\])(i . e . a . ~- = ~ r~\[termt/0\] , gs = gl\[x\]) , and g , \[ x\](x)eF ( key) , where g , \[x\](x)=h(x) . 
(11) holds , iff , by (4) ,  (15) <<~3'\[1/0\] , g3') , n Deljlost(x ) lt , iff by (8) , n2 = as'\[1/0\] , g , ~') ( i . e . , a2 = ( r3'\[l/0\] and g2 = g . ~' = g . ~ , ( by (6)) = g , \[x\](by(14)) , and gs(x)eF ( lost ) . 
It means that g . ~( x ) (= gl\[x\](x ) =- in divi-dualkn , say ) is a key att ( <t0 ) and gs ( x )   ( = k0 ) is lost at t ~ . 
On the other hand , for the formula (3) , (16) ( n , , n . 0 ei \] (3) lliff , by (5) , for some t(<a , (0))  , (17) (<( rl\[termt/0\] , gl ) , n2) ll~(key(x ) & NOW lost(x )) H , iff , by (6) for some h(:=gl\[x\]) , (18) (( a , \[termt/0J , g , \[x\]) , n2) eJlkey(x ) & NOW lost(x)H , iff , by (6) for some n3 , n . ~', g3(---g . ~'), (19)(@,\[termt/0\], g,\[x\]), us)e

It shows formulas ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) have identical meaning . This is just what we require .
