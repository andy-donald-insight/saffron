This paper presents a computer-tooltea-ching system supplied by a language proce-ss or  . Its aim is to correct mistakes in texts written by foreign students learning Russian as a second language  . Since a text may include grammar mistakes , the system cannot use morphological analysis to fool extent  . So one must compile a programm capable of finding and correcting mistakes without traditional means of analysis  . 
To solve this problem we prepone a system that includes a vocabalary and rules of finding and rewriting words  . So the process consists of finding word stems and than correcting word endings  . Semantic and syntactic information ( " a model of ru-ling "/ Mel'~uk 1974/~ necessary for that is written in the vocabulary of verbs as a frame  . The slots of this frame contain semantic and morphological information about words that depend on this vord ~  . 
The vocabulary containing now approximately 200 lexemes is enough for beginners
I ? Introduction
As a rule , computer-tool teaching programs ca~do without language processors  . 
That gives us an opportunity to use Perso-nal computers and other available and in~expensive means  . But such programs can be used only for several types of exercises : mostly those that include substitution or insertion of listed words and endings in a sentence  . 


Such exercises train the student to use correct \] F ~ rds and expressions ? It isim ~ possible to modellexercises of the socal ~ led communicative type/Kostemarov et al  1982/ that form the skills of spontaneous speech ( a pupil constructs some sentences expressing his thoughts on a definite toypic  )  . While doing such exercises one cannot deal with a limited list of variants as  th6~ reexists an infinite number of them ( they are in namerable if a pupil has mastered even an elementary course  )  . That is why we need a language aualisis processor in a computer-assisted teaching program aimed to teach some body t % s ~ the language ~ to ' cemm ~ uicate '  . 
There exists a lot of language analysis and synthesis programs of Russian applied in Automatic translation  , Natural langu ~ age dialogue systems etc . Nevertheless it is impossible to ase them in computer as ~ sisted teaching programms  . 0n the one hand the majorit ~ of them are oriented to the scientific or technological language  . On the other - and more importantly-as a rule they cannot deal with texts contai-ning mistakes  . Those systems that ' under ~ stand ' a text with mistakes donetnotice them or they correct them only printing them on a display/Carbonell  , Hayes "198 #/
So it is necessary to compile a program capable of finding and correcting mistakes ? This problem is new for computational linguistics  . 
2 ~ Description of language processor
To solve the problem we propose a two-compone ~ tt language processor that provl~des morphological  , synt ~ . actic and ( to some extent ) semantic analysis of a text with mistakes , ~ d then it synthesis es correct sentences which express identical meaning to the analysec ~ ones  . This processor deals with separated ~: entences but some information must be used while analysing subsequent sentences of the given text  ( e . g . information about the sex of a speaker as in a Russian text tlds information is necessary for ag ~reement of a predicate in the Past and a subject expressed by the pronoun of the  1st person singular : yachodil ~ I was going , The 1st ste ~ . The processor executes a morphological analysis of a sentence by means of a stem vocabulary which includes variants of the stems of each verb  ( e . g . CHOD-,CHOJ ~ of the verb CHODIT'~togoO etc . ), noun ~ adverb , adjective , pronoun . This list lacludes the typical incorrect variants oZ these stems  ( e . g . ZOV- , ZAV-of the verb ZVAT ' ~ to cal ~ ; a typical mistake is ZAVU instead of ZOVU ) . The first task of the processor is to find a verb and to identify it in the vocabulary  . 
The 2 ridste ~ . The system uses syntactic information of the vocabulary  . Every verb stem is supplied with information of the morphological  , syntactic and semantic features of words w~ch are ruled by the verb  ( e . g . JIT ' ~ to live ~ vchem'place') . 
Since all the nouns in the vocabulary are supplied with semantic information as well  ( eog ; DOM ( ahouse ~' place ') , that enables the s~stem to find appropriate nouns for the verb  . 
Then in accordance with the morphological information the systemeynthesises a correct case form of the noun  ( e . g . VDOME ) which is compared with the form written by the pu -pil  . The difference is marked as a mistake that can be commented on by the list of explanations  ( e . g . a pupil : Jivudom , a correct rect form , synthesised by the system is Ji-vuv dome , mistake : " a wrong case form ") The 3d step . Then the system accomplishes agreement of subject and predicate  ( e . g . 
Students g,m~sg . mrAstudent live ~ ) according to the semantic information the verb is supplied with  ( e . g ; JIT '' person'STU-DENT'person ' ) and morphological information of the subject . The temporal and aspectual characteristics of verbs depend on adverbs  ( e . g . v chera C yesterday O past-jilAt lived~past ) and some other facts . According to this information the system synthesises verbal forms and compares them with those written by the pupil  . 
The 4th step . The agreement between adjectives and nouns is executed in the same way as the previously-by finding words accor ~ ding to the semantic features  ( e ; g ; no ~ Cnew ~' thing ' , ' place ' . . . dom ~ ahoase ~ , place , ) and then by changing of the forms according to the morphological information  ( e . g . 
domm-nov yim ) 3 . Some notes on system exploating The result of this system's work should be a correct text with the correction of mistakes  . A system based on the same principles but more complex should correct some syntactic mistakes in word order  , usage if conjunctions etc . 
If the result of the correction allows two possible variants of a text  , the computer prints : " Deyou want to say " . . . " or commas ) . If a sentence is not admissible by the given system  , a computer prints : " I do not understand you , say it another w ~" . 
The system can ask other questions as well.
In particular , if a pupil prints a personal name unknown to the systemitasks : " Is it a male or female ?" and then this name is inserted into the vocabulary with morphological characteristics fe~m  . or mas__cc . 
Besides the grammatical information the vocabulary should include some encyclopaedi ~ cal information important for a pupil  . E . g . 
if a foreign pupul has come to Moscowal ~ ready then the phrase Japrieduv ~ osk va ~ I'll come to Moscow ~ is wrong  . In order to correct such mistakes one inserts into the morphological and syntactic information an inscription : PRIYEHAT ' ~ I~-past-v Mosk vurto M~s cow which means that a prase about  1 p . sg . and Moscow is correct only in the past . 
Prelimenary input of proper names which a learner ma~have occasion use in a text is desireable as well  . Otherwise mistakes of the type Yapriehaliz kuba  ( instea ~ ofs Kuby ) woul6 not be corrected . 
The system is intended both for testing compositions and dialogues  . Since systems for advanced students would be too sophisticated and would have to include comp-lete information about the language  , nowadays we restrict ourselves to a system for beginners  ( 150 lexemes in the vocabulary )  . The system will be realised on the IBM-PC
