Abstract
Anaphora resolution has proven to be a very difficult problem  ; it requires the integrated application of syntactic  , semantic , and pragmatic knowledge . This paper examines the hypothesis that instead of attempting to construct a monolithic method for resolving anaphora  , the combination of multiple strategies , each exploiting a different knowledge source , proves more effective , theoretically and computationally . Cognitive plausibility is established in that human judgements of the optimal anaphoric referent accord with those of the strategy-based method  , and human inability to determine a unique referent corresponds to the cases where different strategies offer conflicting candidates for the anaphoric referent  . 
1, Introduction : The Complexity of Anaphora
Resolution
Anaphora is a pervasive phenomenon in natural language communication  , whether it be complex multiparty human discourse or more constrained bilateral human computer dialog  . Whereas the ubiquity of the phenomenon and tire necessity to cope with it in the construction of friendly natural anguage interfaces has long been recognized  \[13  ,  8 ,  9 ,  17 ,  15\] , no truly comprehensive computational approaches for anaphora resolution have been proposed  . The RUS parser\[2\] , the XCALIBUR system\[7\] , and other operational natural language systems implement very rudimentary methods  . And , theoretical work in linguistics is primarily concerned with certain types of syntactic intrasentential coreference  , rather than pragmatic intersentential anaphora . 
AnaPhors typically refer back to other constituents in the same sentence  , or to constituents in earlier utterances in fire discourse  . 
Syntactic information plays a central role in establishing appropriate referents for the former case  , intrasentential naphora\[17\] . But , semantic and pragmatic n fonnation is absolutely required in the latter case  , intersentential anaphor a\[15 ,  9\] . This paper addresses the problem of intersentential anaphora resolution  , integrating case frame semantics\[10 ,  12 ,   5\] and more global dialog coherence structures \[11  ,  15 ,  14\] . Empirical studies have shown that intersentential anaphora I is far more frequent and more crucial in designing interactive natural language interfaces  2   \[8\]  . 
96 2 . The Problem : Semantics and Pragmatics Dominate Finding the appropriate anaphoric referent has been long recognized as a difficult problem  , requiring l nuch ~ emautic and pragmatic lmowledge  . Consider , for instance , the tbllowing two sets of examples : John took the cake from the table and ateit  . 
John took the cake from the table and washed it.
Tile robot pushed the box towards the convey or belt  . But , it goojSd and dropped it on its way there . 
Semantic preference constraints ( e . g . , \[18 ,  11) , if pmp : ~ rly coded , suffice to resolve the first example . The pt'eferre'l object of ingestation is an edible substance  . It is a little more difficult to mechanize a process that excludes things such as cakes from being the object of washing  . One cannot simply write a " NOT ( edibley restriction on the object case of the verb " to wash "  . Alter , all , vegetables and fruits are occasionally washed prior to eating them  . 
Peltlaps a combination of typicality judgements with pragmatic knowledge xla ' a polating the effects of attempting to drown a cake in sink full of water comes into play  . Or , more abstractirf femntial constraints are appropriate  , snch as requiring that the object of wash be unchanged by immersion in water  . Interestingly , Subjects given only the " . . . and wash edit " sentence report consistently that they didn't even consider the cake a reasonable r ferent for " it "  . 
In the robot example , there ate four anaphoric referents , counting the possessive " its " and the locative " there "  , referring to three different antecedents . Although subjects report little difficulty ascertaining the referent for each anaphor in a consistent manner  , it appears that sophisticated semantic ~ are required  . Why is the referent for " it " in " it go of ed and dropped  . . . "the robot rather than the box or the convey or belt ? One could argue that the box cannot a ke action  , but what allows a robot to go of and not a convey or belt ? Is it something as subtle as the degree to which the former can be anthropomolphized being greater than the degree to which the latter can be anthmpomorphized ? The difficulty in anaphoric referent specification i narratives has been argued convincingly by many researchers including Chamiak in his work on children'story comprehension  \[9\]  , where substantial pragmatic domain knowledge must be brought to bear  , and by one of the authors\[4\] , where knowledge of goals and personality traits is required to resolve difficult referents  . Hence , the hypothesis that anaphor resolution in its fnll generality is at best a diffict flt problem  , and at worst an almost intractable one , is well supported . 
Nevertheless , somewhat less ambitious endeavors can prove far more tractable  , and yet be of major practical Import . Hayes \[13\] argued for the notion of limit od-domain anaphora in a natural language interface to an electronic mail system  . Webber \[17\] demonstrated that intrasentential anaphora was more tractable than its intersentential counterpart  , largely through the categorization of syntactic devices absent from larger textual or dialog segments  . 
This paper explores an intemrediate position : addressing much larger classes of anaphors than those of Hayes  \[13\] in a systematic mariner , but stopping short of full generality , which requires unbounded pragmatic knowledge and inference  . We explore the central hypothesis that anaphora resolution may be best accomplished throughfire combination of a set of strategies  , rather than by a single monolithic method . The apparent complexities lie in the combination of these multiple strategies to produce syntactically  , semantically arid pragmatically sound anaphoric resolutions  . In the multiple xamples analyzed ,   3 unambiguous resolutions reported by human subjects correspond to situations where the applicable strategies concur on the refer ont of an anaphor  , and disagreement on the con'eet referent by the human subjects corresponds to situations where the applicable strategies propose different candidate referents for file anaphor in quest it m  . 
3. Multiple Resolution Strategies
In this section we propose a general framework for anaphor resolution ba~d on the integration of multiple knowledge sources : sentential syntax  , case frame semantics , dialog structure , and general world knowledge . The underlying theoretical tenet is : Anaphor resolution is not a monolithic autonomous process  ; it requires access and integration of all the knowledge sources necessary for dialog and text lnterprel'ation  . These linguistic knowledge sources are brough to bear as constraints or preferences encoded as multiple resolntion strategies  . 
Each source of knowledge use thl in resolving intersentential an aphnra is presented below  , along with corresponding examples , and a statement of the anaphoric resolution strategy  . 
3.1. Local Anaphor Constraints
Certain anaphot ~ carry with them constraints ( number , gender , case , etc . ) which must be satisfied by the candidate referents  . For instant'e , gender uniquely specifies the anaphor in : John at ~ dMary went shopping  . He bought a steak . 

Tile strategy here is trivial :
Eliminate from consideration all candidate referents that violate the local constraints of the anaphor its question  . 
A variant of this strategy has been implemented in RUS and in 

3.2. Case-role Semantic Constraints
Here the ease-role semantics impose constraints on what can fill them  . If they are filled by an anaphor ( which specifies few if any semantic features )  , the case role constraints must be also satisfied by the referent of tile anaphor  , thus eliminating from consideration all candidate anaphor referents that violate constraints on the case role occupied by the anaphor  . Consider our previous example , where the semantic on straints on the object case of " to eat " and " to wash " impose restrictions on the possible case fillem and prove sufficient o select a unique referent  . 
John took the cake from the table and ateit . lit : cake \] John took the cake from the table and wash edit  . lit=table\]The slrategy here is also fairly simple : Eliminm'e from consideration all candidate referents that violate any case -constraint imposed on the anaphor its question ~ Prefer those candidates that accord with typical ease fillers  , in the absence of hard constraints . 
XCALIBUR implements this strategy directly though use of its case frame grammar  . With the I-rule mechanism , it was possible to implement an adhoc variant of this strategy in RUS as well  . 
3 . 3 . Preconttition/Postcondition Constraints Using realworld knowledge and pragmatics  , it is possible to say that a candidate antecedent cannot be the referent of an anaphor because some action occurring between the referent and the anaphor invalidates the assumption that they denote one and the same object or event  . 
John gave Toman apple . He ate the apple . \[ he = Tom \] Here , " he " refers to Tom , as Jolm no longer has the apple . The postcondition on give is that the actor no longer have the object being given  , which , : on fiicts with the precondition one at that the actor have the item being eaten  , if the actor is assumed to be John . 
The strategy is simple , but requires a fairly large amount of knowledge to be useful for a broad range of cases : Eliminate from consideration all candidate referents associated with actions whose postconditions violate the preconditions of the action containing the anaphor  . 
3.4. Case . role Persistence Preference
We observe a pervasive form of " linguistic inertia " that manifests as a preference to assign the referent of an anaphor to the linguistic entity in the discourse context hat filled the corresponding semantic case role in an earlier utterance  . This is a generalized form of ease-role parallelism  , which has proven crucial in ellipsis resolution \[8  ,  7 ,  5\] , although in anaphora resolution it is demoted from the status of a categorical constraint to that of a preference  . 
Mary gave an apple to Susan . John also gave her an orange . \[ her=Susan \] Mary gave an apple to Susan . She also gave John an orange . \[she=Mary\]The first anaphor relers to Susan , whereas the second anaphor refers to Mary . Clearly it is not a matter of primacy or recency , as the sentence structures are identical . Rather it is a case of structural parallelism . And , the semantic structnre dominates over the syntactic one  . For instance , in the first example , " Susan " is the object of the " to " prepositional phrase  , whereas the corelerent anaphor is in the indirect ol~iect position : two different syntactic roles that map into the same semanticase  , recipient . In the second example above , both syntactic mad semantic structures coincide , and therefore the preference is stronger . Note , moreover , that the subject or direct object form of the pronoun  ( " she " vs " her " ) is not the primary source of discriminant knowledge  . For instance , in the example below , one has only the anaphor " it " , but the same referent discrimination occurs by semanticase-role parallelism : The robot gave the dog abone  . John also gave it some water , lit = dog \] The robot gave the dog abone . It also gave John some water , lit = robot\]To provide more ammunition in support of semantic case role persistence  , consider the following final example , with three possible referents to the anapher " him "  . It is clear that " Peter " is the preferred referent  , once again due to the persistence of the underlying semantic recipient case  . 
John carried the box of papers from Bill to Peter.
He also sent him Mary's books . \[ he=John , him = Peter \] The semantic preference strategy can be stated as follows : Search first for acceptable referents in the antecedent phrase  ( or phrases ) that occur in the same semanticase role as the attaphor  , lf a match satisfying all constraints is found , look no further ; else search the other case roles . 
To our knowledge , this preference strategy has been neither proposed nor implemented prior to our work on the Universal Parser  ( reported below )  , yet it counts for a large number of anaphor resolutions in our sample set  . 
3.5. Semantic Alignment Preference
A form of pragmatic " Occam's razor " exists in not postulating extra roles for the same objects in different sentences in the discourse  . This preference is a more gcner ~ d and looser form of case role in ertia  , discussed above , in that the we have in m tia of the underlying action  . 
For instance , in the example below , this preference manifests as preferring all departures to be from the park  , and all arrival sm beat the club : Mary drove from the park to the club  . Peter went here too . 

Mary drove from the park to the chub . Peter left there too . 

The locative anaphor " there " refers to " the club " in the first example above  , but refers to " the park " in the second example , yet both sentence share the identical syntactic structure and the same basic underlying semantic case structure  . However , discourse cohesion with respect o the same underlying action  ( leaving the pink and going to the club )  . Therefore , the former aligns with the second ( destination ) part , whereas the latter aligns with the first ( source ) part . 
The strategy here is a bit more difficul to state , and certainly has not been implemented in any system to date : If the clause in which the anaphor is embedded aligns with a previous clause  ( " aligns " means that it can represent the same underlying action  , perhaps with d~fferent instantiated case fillers )  , or with part of a previous clause , search first for referents of the anaphor in that clause  . If there are no allowable re#rents in the semantically aligned clause  , expand the search to other antecedent clauses ; else halt the search . 
3.6. Syntactic paralielism preference
Although semantic and pragmatic parallelism ( case-persistence , and alignment , respectively , in the discussion above ) appear to dominate over syntactic parallelism , the latter plays an important role if two clauses are directly contrasted  ( e . g . , in a coordinate structure , or by means of explicit discourse cohesion markers  \[14\]  )  . Consider the following examples : The girls cout leader paired Mary with Susan  , but she had paired her with Nancy last time . \[she=leader , her=Mary\]The girls cout leader paired Mary with Susan  , but she had paired Nancy with her last time . \[she=leader , her=Susan \] There is no reason to prefer different referents for the pronoun " her " in each sentence above  , other than retaining as much as possible the surface syntactic order from the first coordinate clause in the second clause  . The strategy here is summarized as follows : In coordinated clauses  , adjacent sentences or explicitly contrasted sentences  , prefer the anaphoric referent hat preserves the surface syntactic role from the first clause  . 
3 . 7 . Syntactic Topicalization Preference Topicalized structures are searched first for possible anaphoric referents  . Consider , for instance , the following pseudo-cleft constmctions : It was Mary who told Jane to go to New York  . Why did sited oit ?\[ she=Mary \] It was Jane who went to New York at Mary's bidding  . Why did she do it ?\[ she=Jane \] It was Mary who told Peter to go to New York  . Why did he do it ?\[ he = Peter \] It was Peter who wento New York at Mary's bidding  . Why did he do it ?\[ he = Peter \] In the first set of examples  , describing essentially the same t caderlying action  , the topicalized person becomes the referent of the anaphor " she : " " Mary " in the first sentence  , " Jane " in the second . And , the action associated with that person become the r ~ ferent of " it  . " However , to stress that topicalization is a preferential rather than categorical strategy  , consider the second set of examples above . The exact same semantic and syntactic structures yield " Peter " both times as the referent of " lie "  , because localized constraint so dictate , regardless of who is to piealized . Thus , it is important to distinguish constraints from preferences in anaphora resolution  . The topicalization strategy may be stated as follows : Search first a syntactically to piealized part of the candidate antecedent clause  ( or clauses ) for the referent of the anaphor . If an acceptable referent is found , search no further ; else search the rest of the clause(s ) . 
This strategy surprisingly enough has not been exploited h ~ any system to our knowledge  , although it is easy to establish syntactic topiealization  ( indicated by linguistic devices such as fronting , and cleft constructions ) . In contrast , he much more complex phenomenon of pragmatic to piealization by dialog focus or actor focus  ( discussed below ) was suggested by Sidner\[lS\]We also believe that dialog but lacking a computationally -adequate theory for dialog-level focus track h~g  ( Sidner's is a partial theory )  , we could not yet implement such a strategy . 
3.8. Intersentential Recency Preference
Thus far we have focused on the problem of selecting the best anaphoric referent among several candidates  , all from a single previous sentence ( or coordinated clause )  . When prior context contains many sentences , the question aturally ari~s of how far back to search for the anaphoric referent  , and how to prioritize that search . 
At the paragraph ( or dialog ) level level , we advocate searching sentences in reverse chronological or dm  , applying all the constraints and preferences to select among possible candidates within each sentence  . If there are no satisfactory candidates in the previous sentence  , then the one before that is considered , and so on . Although we are investigating more sophisticated tect miques  , these awaita more comprehensive ( nonlinear ) theory of discourse structure-and one that is prec is enough to permit implementation  . 
4. Integrating the Strategies
In order to apply a diverse set of strategies , uchas those presented in this paper , one needs to make a distinction between constraints  ( which cannot be violated )  , and preferences ( which discriminate among candidate satisfying all constraints  )  . The latter may be ranked in a partial order ( as the goals trees in \[4\] )  , or may be offered a voting scheme where the stronger preferences get more votes  , and where conflicting preferences of equal voting power indicate true ambiguity  . 
Our resolution method works by applying the constraints first to reduce the number of candidate referents for the anaphor in question  . 
Then , the preferences are applied to each of the remaining candidates  . 
If more than one preference applies , and each Suggests different candidate referents for the anaphor in question  , ' all of which have passed the constraint tests , then we consider the anaphor to have a truly ambiguous referent  . Thus , when faced with conflicting knowledge sources of equal strength  , we simply reduce the space of possible anaphoric referents to those that are accepted by constraints and indicated as preferred by one or more preferences  . Earlier hand simulations of a slightly different method  4 on 70 examples ( including those presented earlier in this paper ) yielded 49 unique resolutions , 17 conflicting possibilities , and 4 anomalous cases . Human judgements correlate very well in terms of identifying the same referent as that suggested by the system in the  49 unique cases . 5 Moreover , the majority of the 17 multiple-referent cases were judged ambiguous by our subjects  ( the rest required complex world knowledge to establish a unique referent  )  . Therefore , we believe that one can indeed achieve humanlike performance with the multistrategy method of determining referents to anaphors using different sources of linguistic knowledge in a semi-modular fashion  . 
5. A Practical Implementation
We have developed an anaphore solver using Local Constraints  , Case Role Semantic Constraints , Pre/Postcondition Constraints , Case Role Persistence , Intersentential Recency Preference , and Syntactic Topiealization Preference . The implementation ccursintile context of the Universal Parser  ( UP ) project\[6 ,   16\] attile Center for Machine Translation at Camegie . .Mellon University . The UP uses a modified form of lexical -functional  grammar\[3\] unifying symactie and semantic knowledge sources to produce a complete parse of each sentence  . The anaphore solver operates postfacto on the set of instantiated semanticase frames and syntactic trees  , attempting to resolve anaphors in the parse of the newest sentence using earlier parses  ( semantic and syntactic ) as context omine for candidate referents . We expect here solver to become an integral part of our multilingual machine translation effort  . 
Candidate ~' cferents are derived by extracting the noun phrases from the most-receip trevious entences that the resolv cr has processed  . 
The number of sentences examined may be changed , allowiug the future addition of discourse phenomena to further restrict the sentenees which are examined for candidate referents  . 
The pmfere , Lcesue a voting method to detennine which candidate referent is most preferred  . Each preference strategy is given an individual weight  , and may vote with less than its fuU weight for less-preferred candidates  , such as case role persistence in a referent several sentences removed from the anaphor  . 
In addition to ailing out candidates , the case-role and local anaphor constraints may also cast votes to t those allowable candidates which are most clo  , ~ely matched to the anaphor or con'espond to typical fillers  . In elf , ' , ct , fllese strategies indicate a preference in the absence of hard conso'aints  . For ex ~ unple , ti ~ e gender constraint would prefer a candidate reference of female gender over one of in determinate gender when resolving an auaphor of female gender  , while at the same time eliminating all candidates of male gender  . 
After applying the preferences , the most preferred candidate referent is unified with the reference to restrict he range of possible values as mu ~: has possible  . For example , if she is determined to refer to doctor , all future anaphorie references to the doctor will be required to have female or unknown gender  . However , if multiple candidates have received nearly the same number of votes  , the anaphor is coasidered to beant higuous . 
Tt le anaphor resolver i ~ able to resolve partially-specified definite noun phrases with an antecedent oun phrase  . To do so , along with the other lo(-al constraints , the head nouns , ' uld the remaining slots in the noun ph ~ a . ~care checked for agreement with the reference . The head nounol the candidate must be the samc as  , or an instance of , the head noun o (" the reference . For the remaining slots , it suffices for corresponding slots to be uniliable with each other or missing from either the d ~  , ,finite noun phrase or the candidate referent . Unlike anaphors , which must have a suitable referent , it is not considered an error if there are no referents which pass all constraints  . We believe that the ability to resolve definite noun phrases with basically the saute approach as anaphors is an indication of the generality of our strategies an altheir implementation exploiting semantic and syntactic constraint ut ~ ification methods  . 
The curt ' cut test suite consists often examples , totalling 3 l , sentences ( : outaining 27 anaphors and three definite noun phrases with priorreii ~ rents  .   6 The anaphor resolver correctly resolves " all but four of the anapho~s  ,   , ' mr determines the correct referent for all of the definite noun ptu ' as es  ; In two of t be four problematicases , the anaphor is an it referring to an action only indirectly mentioned  , which is beyond the scope of the resolver . Tile remaining two anaphors are in the example John carried the box from Bill to Peter  . He also sent him
Macy's books.
Here , him remains an ~ biguous , and he also remains ambiguous between John and Bill  ( with the current voting scheme , John is preferred over Bill ) . 
The follo , ~ eingrtm of the anaphor rcsolver ( edited to save space ) illustrate several of the strategies . Each candidate referent is tagged with a number indicating how many votes it has received so far  . The intersentential recency preference is applied at the same time that the candidates a ~ e collected and tagged because of its computational efficiency  ; lttus , the initial list of candidates already includes the votes from intersentential recency  . The ease-role persistence preference is applied between pre/post cenditlon constraints and local constraints  , because removal of eliminated candidates ( in this implementation ) also remove stim information on which previous entence a candidate originates from  . Then , case-role constraints are applied , and if multiple candidates remain , the rem~fining preferences ( currently only syntactic topicalizatio10 are applied .

Note sllnter clausal anaphora in coordinate constructions behaves much like a constrained version of intersentential anaphora  , where syntactic parallelism ( between the coordinated clauses ) plays a more dominant role . 
2 No claim ;; , however , are made for file relative frequency or utility of resolving intersentential vs intrasentential anaphors in processing narrative or expository texts  . 
3Although many of our anaphora instances come from actual user utterances in our experience with domain-oriented humancomputer interfaces  , we expect hat the strategies developed here am of more general applicability  . For clarity of exposition in this paper , we have selected exmnples not from our humancomputer dialogs  , but from everyday events . 
'* Using preferenccs to determine whict * candidates are tested against the constrain ~ s  5Olten   , more than one slrategy suggested the same referent  , increasing or . r confidence . Language is redundant , and it may prove useful to exp ' loit hat redundancy  .
