Ill this study , we will look t br the patterns and generalizations in the i  ) honemic ditrer ( m ( : es1 ) et ; ween Dutch and Fhmfish1) y using two ( tat ; n-drivent(~chniques .

Two corpora were used t br this study , r(~l ) resenting the Norl ; hern Dul , eh and Sout ; hern Dutch w ~ rbmts . D)r Northenl Dut(:h Celex ( re-leas( ; 2) was used and for Flemish Fonilex ( ver-sioll1 . 01)) .

The Fonilex database is a list of more than 200 . 0 00 word tbrms together with their Flemish pronunciation  . For each word tb rm , an abstract lexical representation is given , together with the concrete pronunciation of that word tbrm in three speech styles : highly formal s t  ) eech , sloppy speech and " normal " speech ( which is an intermediate lvel )  . A set of phonological rewrite rules was used to deduce these concrete speech stylesti'om the abstract t  ) honological tbrm . The initial phonological transcription was obtained by a grapheme-to-phoneme converter and was afterwards corrected by hand  . Fonilex uses YAPA as encoding scheme . By means of their identification umber , the Fonilexentries also contain a rethrence to the Celex entries  , since Celex served as basist br the list of word tbrms in Fonilex  . E . g . t br the word " a ait j e " ( Eng . :" stroke ") , the relevant Celex entry is "25/a ait . j e/5/'aj-tj ? /" and the corresponding Fonilex entry looks like  "251aaitjel'ajts@l  " . The word tbrms in Celex with a fl'equency of 1 and higher ( indicated in field 3 ) ~ reincluded in Fonilex and fl : om the list with tiequency  0  , only the monomorphematic words were selected . 
In the fi ) llowing section , a brief explanation is given of the method we used to search for the overlap and ditfhrences between both region alw ~ riants of Dutch  . Section 3 provides a quantitative analysis of the results . Section 4 discusses the ditt brences between Celex and Fonilex  , starting fl ' omtile set of transtbrmation rules that is learned during Transtbrmation-Based Error -Driven Learning  ( TBEDL )  . These rules are COln pared to the production rules produced by  C5  . 0 . In addition , we present an overview of the non-systematic difl hrences  . In a final section , some concluding remarks are given . 
"2 Rule Induction
Our starting i ) oil d ; is the assumption that the differences in the phonemic transcriptions between Flemish and Dutch are highly systematic  , and can be represented in a set of rules . Hence , these rules provide linguistic insight into the overlap and discrepancies between both w~ri -ants  . Moreover , they can be used to adapt pro-mmciation databases tbrDutchmd  ; omatically to Flemish and vice versa . Apossil ) lew ~ y to find the regul ~ trities within the difl brences be-tweet  , both corpora is to make the rules by hand , which is time-consmning and error-prone . 
Another option is to make use of a data-oriented learning method in which linguistic knowledge is learned automatically  . In our experiment we have made use of two rule induction techniques  , viz . ~: a ~ nsformation-Based Error Driven Learning ( TBEDL )   ( Brill , 1995) and C5 . 0 ( Quinlan , 1993) . 
In the process of ' Transfbn nation-Based
Error-Driven Learning , transtbrmation rules are learned by comparing a corpus that is annotated by an initial state annotator to a correctly amlo-tared corpus  , which is called the " truth " . l ) ur-ing that comparison , an ordered list of trans-tbrmation rules is learned  . This ordering implies that the application of an earlie rule sometimes makes it possible tbra later rule to apply  ( so called " feeding " )  . In other cases , as also descrit ) ed in the work of Roche and Schabes ( 1995 )  , a given structure fiTdlsto undergo a rule as a consequence of s  ( )me earlier rule ( " bleed-ing " )  . These rules are applied to tile output of the initial state ammtator ill order to t  ) ring that out t ) ut closer to the " truth " . A rule consists of two parts : a transtbrmation and a " triggering environment "  . For each iteration in the learning process , it is investigated tbreach possible rule how many mistakes can be corrected through al  ) t ) lication of that rule . The rule which causes the greatest error reduction is retained  . 
Figure 1 shows the TBEDL learning process apt ) lied to the comparison of the Celex representation and the Fonilex " n  ( )rmal " representa- ; ion , which flmctions as " truth " . In this case , the task is to learn how to transtbrm Celexrel ) -resentations into Fonilex representations ( i . e . , translate Dutch pronunciation to Flemish pro -mmciation  )  . Both corpora serve as input t br the " transtbrmation rule learner "  ( Brill ,  1995) . 
This learning process results in an ordered list of transformation rules which reflects the systematic differences between both representations  . 
A rule is read as : " change x ( Celex representation ) into y ( Fonilex representation ) in the following triggering enviromnent " .

We first test whettm rule induction techniques are able to learn to adapt Northern Dutch pronunciations to Flemish when trained on an un : -ber of examples  . With . Transformation-Based Error-Driven Learning and C5 . 0 , we looked for the systematic differences between Northern 
Dutch and Flenfish.
In TBEDL , the complete training set of 90% was used for learning the transfbrmation rules . 
A threshold of 15 errors was specified , which means that learning stops if the error reduction lies under that threshold  . Due to the large amount of training data , this threshold was chosen to reduce training time  . This resulted in about 450 rules . In figure 2 , the number of transformation rules is plotted against the accuracy of the conversion between both w  , riants . 

9 5   9O  ~  75   7O number ot ' transformation rules Figure 2: Descrii ) tion of the accuracy of the word and phoneme level in relation to the nnmber of transtbrmation rules  . 
Figure 2 shows that especially tile first 50 rules lead to a considerable increase of performance fl'om  59  . 07% to 79 A0% on the word level and from 92 . 77% to 96 . 98% for phonemes , which indicates the high applicability of these rules  . 
Afterwards , the increase of accuracy is more graduah from 79 . 40% to 88 . 95% ( words ) and fl'om 96 . 98% to 98 . 52% ( phonemes ) . 
For the C5 . 0 experiment ~50% (887 . 647 cases ) of the original training set served as training set  ( more training data was not feasible )  . A decision tree model and a production rule model we relmilt from the training cases  . The tree gave rise to 745 rules . These production rules were applied to the original  10% test set wensed in the TBEDL experiment . In order to make the type of task comparable for the transfbr-marion based approach used by TBEDL  , and the classification-based approach used in C5 . 0, the output class to be predicted by C5 . 0 was either ~0' when the Celex and Fonilex phoneme are identical ( i . e . no change ) , or the Fonil exphoneme when Celex and Fonilex differ  . 
Table 2 gives an overview of the overlap between Celex and Fonilex after application of t  ) oth rule induction techniques . A comparison of these results shows that , when evaluating both TBEDL and C5 . 0 on the test set , the rules learned by the Brill-tagger have a higher error rate  , even when C5 . 0 is only trained on half the data used by TBEDL . Ontile word level , the initial overlap of 59 . 07% is raised to 88 . 9 5% after application of the 450 transformation rules , and to 90 . 35% when using the C5 . 0 rules . On the phoneme level , the initial 92 . 77% overlap is increased to 98 . 52% ( TBEDL ) and 98 . 74% ( C5 . 0) . C5 . 0 also has a slightly lower error rate for the consonants  , vowels and diphthongs .

When looking at those cases where Celex and Foni lex difl'er  , we see that it ; ixpossible to learn Brill rules which predict 73% of these differences at the word level and 79  . 5% of the differences at the phoneme level . Tile C5 . 0 rules are more or less 3% more accurate : 76 . 4% ( words ) and 82 . 6% ( phonemes ) . It is indeed possible to reliably ' translate ' Dutch into Flenfish  . 
4 Qualitative Analysis
In this section , we are concerned with the linguistic quality of tile rules that were extracted using TBEDL and  C5  . 0 . To gain more insight ill the important differences between both pronunciation variants  , a qualitative analysis of tile rules was performed  . Therefore , the conversion rules were listed and compared . The following list presents some examples for consonants  , vowels and diphthongs . Starting point TBEDL , which are compared with the 10C5 . 0 rules , which most reduce the error rate . In the , transtbrmation rules 1) resented below , the relationship between Dutchart (1 Flemish , especially the most important differences , are extracted fronlthee or l ) or a and t brmulated in a set of easily understmldal ) le rules . The C5 . 0 produ (: tion rules , Oll the other hand also descrit/e the over-lapl ) ing phonelnes between Celex and Dmilex , which makes it hard to have at clear overview of the regularities in the dilt'erences  1  ) etween both variants of Dutch . The fact that the category '0' was used to describe the overlap between the databases  ( no chauge ) does not ; really hell ) . 
Even if C5 . 0 discovers that no change is the default rifle , additional specific rules ( lescrit)ing the , default condition are never the l(~ssne('c , ssary to l ) reven the other rules fl ' omtiring incorrectly . 
4.1 Consonants
Nearly 60% of the differences on the consonant level concerns l  ; he alternation 1 ) etween voiced and unvoiced consonants . In the word " gelij kaardig " ( Eng . :" equal ") , for example , we linda/xolcika:rdox/with avoi ( ' elessvelm:fri ( ' ative in Dutch and/golcika:rdax/with a voiced velar fricative in Flenlish  . The word ' hnachiavellisme " ( Eug . : " Machiavellism " ) is pronommed as/ln ( igi:j a:w:hsm , )/ in Dutchan(tas/m(d?J . j ( , wchzmo/in Flelnish .

T ~ t ble 3 clearly shows the alternation t ) e-tween / x/and / , g / . This alternation also is the subject of the first transformation rule  , namely "/ x/changes into / , g / i t , case of a word t ) eginning ( indicated by " STA All . T ") one or two I ) ositions t ) ef bre " . When looking at the tot ) ten of the C5 . 0 l ) roduction rules that most reduce error rate , the two most important rules also describe this alternation : ilnle  682:   ( 7749/29 , lift 110 . 9) t1 in =, , c:finx, . q , ;, Q1->classy\[0 . 996\]
Rule 683: (7749/29, lift 110 . 91flin=,,~:finx,,q->class,g\[0 . 9 96\] Another important phenomenon is the use of p ~tlatalisationi Flemish  , as in the word " aa it je "( Eng . :" stroke ") , where Folfilex uses the t ) a latalized for tll/aljtJ'o/instead of/a : jtjo /  . 
The two sul ) sequent transtbrmation rules 3 and d make this change possible . In the top 10 of C5 . 0 rules , only the tirsti ) arl ; of this change is descril)ed . Transtbrmation rule 8 ( les ( 'rit ) es the omission of the i ) hone me/t/inea , s e , of the gral ) hemic combination < ti > , as in " t ) olitie ' ~( Eng . :" police ") .

These rules , describing the differences between Northern Dutch and Flemish consonants  , vowels and diphthongs also make linguistic sense . Linguistic literature , such as the work of Booij ( 1995 ) and De Schutter ( 1978 ) indicates tendencie such as voicing and devoicing on the consonant level and the confllsion of tense and lax vowels as important differences between Northern Dutch and Flemish  . The same discrepancies are f ( mnd in the transcriptions made by both Flemish and Dutch subjects in the Dutch transcription experiments described in Gillis  ( 19! ) 9 )  . 
5 Error Analysis
Besidestile systematic phonenlic differences between Flemish and Dutch  , there are a number of mmy stematic differences between both databases  . After application of 450 transformation rules ,  88 . 95% of the words makes a correct ; transition from the Celex-transcription to the Fonilex-transcriptiol L The  7d5   C5  . 0 rules lead to a 90 . 35% . Using the Brill-tagger , it also has to be taken into account that rules can be undone by a later rule  ( see also Roche and Schabes ( 1995 ) ) , as in tile word " feuilleteer " ( Bug . : " leaf througlf ') . Celex provides the transcrit)-tion/t'(x' . y . iol ; e:r/ , while Fonil extranscribes it as/f~:jate : r/ . During learning , the transtbrmation rule " change/my/into / ~:/ if the preceding graphenm is an < e > " is learned  . This results in the correct Fonil ex-/ff~:jote : r/ . This transformation , however , is canceled by a later rule , which changes /0:/ back into/oey/if tile * bl-lowing grapheme is an < i >  . This leads again to the original Celex -transcription  . C5 . 0 , which does not sufl hr from s in filar consequences of rule ordering  , will correctly classify " feuilleteer " . 
hit his section , we are concerned with the relnaining errors after application of all rules  . 
Making use of a rule induction technique to extract the subregularities in the differences between the corpora can lead to some rules  , which , however , may be based on noise or errors in the databases . The retbre , a manual analysis was done , which showed that the explanation of these remaining errors is two tbhl  . 
A first reason is that no rule is awfilable tbr less frequent cases  . TILe rules are induced on the basis of a sufficiently big frequency effect  .

Oft WOrifle in ( hu:-tion techniques , nnmely 3h:mlsformation-Based Error-Driven Learning ( Brill , 1995) and C5 . 0 ( Quinlan , 1993) . Studying the accuracy of 1) oth systems , we noted that M'ter ~ l ) plication of the transtbrmation rules that were learned t  ) y the TBEDL method , 73% of the differences ( m the word level and 80% of the ditl'crences on the t ) honeme level was covered by the rules . The C5 . 0 I ) ercentages are some 3('/o higher . This ( : ( ) r-resl ) onds with an overall a ( : ( :ura ( : y in 1 ) redicting the 1 ) ronun ( : iation of nlq ( ' . mish word l ) romm-cb ~ tionti ' om the l ) ut ch pronunciation of about 89% for TBEDL and 90% for C5  . 0 ( about 99% at i ) honeme level for l ) oth) . 
A qualitative analysis of the first ten rules produced by both methods  , suggested that l ) oth TBEDL and 05 . 0 extract valuable rules describing the most important linguistic differences between Dutch mid Flelnish on the consonant and the vowel level  . The C5 . () production rules , however , are more numerous and more dit\[icult to interpret  . The results of the transtbrnlation-based le ~rnillg approach are clearly more un-derstand Mfle than those of a classification-based lenrning approach for this problem  .
