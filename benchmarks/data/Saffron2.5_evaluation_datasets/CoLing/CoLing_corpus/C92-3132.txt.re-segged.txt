In this paper we show the relation between the " surface  ( morphological ) cases " and " deep cases " ( participants )  , and the possible way to automate the creation of a syntactic dictionary provided with frames containing information about deep cases and their morphemic counterparts of particular lexical items  ( Czech verbs )  . 

In the project MATRACEI ( MAchine TR Anslation between
Czech and English ) the first aim is to create two parallel text corpora  ( Czech and English )  , morphologically and syntactically tagged . Then it will be possible to use these corpora not only for creating an MT system but also for other linguistic research  , needed e . g . for systems of NL understanding . For these purposes we try to make the syntactic representation " broader " so that the further work would be easier  . 
I Project MATRACE , a research project of the Institute of
Applied and Formal Linguistics and the Institute of Theoretical and Computational Linguistics  , is carried out within the IBMA cademic Initiative project in 

In the syntactic representation of a sentence , based on dependency grammar , we will specify not only the dependency and syntactic roles of the modifications but also their underlying counterparts  ( i . e . " deep cases ") . For this sort of tagging we need a dictionary with morphological and syntactic information  , which consists of morphological paradigms of single words and their valency frames containing both syntactic and underlying roles of their members  . As there is no such dictionary in machine-rea -dable form we have to create it  . 
Unfortunately we even cannot extract the words with their frames from an existing corpus as we are only creating it  . What we have is a morphological dictionary , which is to be enriched by the syntactic information  . The linguist adding this information should enter the surface frame and specify its underlying counterpart  . We try to help him/her by automating the choice of the appropriate correspondence between " surface " and " deep " cases  . 
In this paper we will concentrate on the problems of verb and its valency slots  . The generalization of our method for nouns and adjectives will not be difficult as in many cases the syntactic frame of these words is just derived from the corresponding verb  .

Theoretical background
Using the framework of the functional generative description  ( FGP , see Sgall et al 1986) , slightly simplified for the purpose of this paper  , we distin-guish two levels : a level of underly ing structure  ( US , with the participants or " deep cases " ) and a level of surface structure ( SS , morphemic units as parts of this are used here ) . As for the modifications of verbs we dist in -guish inner participants and free modific at ions  ( see Panevov ~1974-5 )  . This can be understood as the paradigmatical c lassification of all possible verbal modi ficati-ons  . The other dimension of their classific at ion  ( combinatoric or syntagmatic dimension ) concerns their obligatoriness and option a-l ity with the particular lexical item within the verbal frame  . The verbal frame contains slots for obligatory and optional inner participants  ( which will be filled by the labels for " deep cases " and corresponding morphemic forms  ) and obligatory free modifications . The difference between an obligatory and opt ional participant is important for a parser  , however , we will leave this dichotomy aside in this contribution  . 
The following operational criteria for dis tinguishing between inner participants and free modifications are used : If the verbal modification can occur only once with a single verb token and if the governing verbs for a particular modification may be listed  , the modification is considered as an " inner partici-pant "  . There are five partici-pants : Actor , Objective , 
Addressee , Origin and Effect . The other modifications ( Time,
Locative , Direction , Aim , Reason,
Instrument , Regard , Manner etc . ) can reoccur with a s ingle verb token and may modify any verb  . 
With some verbs free modifica-tions can also enter the respect-ive verb frame : either the construction is ungrammatical without them  ( to behave HOW , to last
HOWLONG , to live WHERE etc . ) or they are semantically obligatory , although they can be omitted on the SS level . This can be tested by a dialogue of the fol lowing type : 
A . Myfriend came.
B . Where ?
A.*I don't know.
Unacceptability of the answer " I don't know " indicates that the modification where is a part of a verbal frame of the verb to come  . 
According to the theory proposed by Panevov ~ ( 1974-5 , esp .  ? 5 ) the following consequences are accepted here : If a verb has only one inner partici-pant then this participant is 
Actor . If a verb has two partici-pants then these are Actor and 
Objective . As fo ~ thel " and 2 ~ participant our approach is simi-larto Tesni ~ re's  ( 1959 )  . However , if three or even more slots of a verbal frame are occupied then semantic considerations are involved  . This is different from
Tesni~re's solution and does not fully coincide with Fillmore's proposals  ( Fillmore 1968 ,  1970) . 
Determining the Addressee,
Origin and Effect is rather dif-ficult and requires taking into account the combination of surface cases in the frame  ( including the form of the Objective )  , the animacy of single members of the frame etc . Though there is no one-to-one mapping between " deep cases " and " surface cases "  , we are able to discover certain regularities and provide some generalization reflected in an algorithm  . 

In inflectional languages with ( morphological ) cases it is apparent that some cases are typical for certain participants  . 
Objective is typically realized
AcrEsDECOLING-92 . NANTES , 2328 AOtn "1992886 P~OC . OFCOLING-92, NANTES , AUG .  2328 ,   1992 as the Accusative and Addressee as the Dative case  . in Czech there are other typical ( prepositional ) cases . Thus z + Genitive ( out of sb , s t ) or od + Genitive ( from sb , s t ) ar ~ typical for
Origin , ha+Accusative(atst ) , do + Genitive ( to st ) or v + Accu-sative ( into sb , s t ) are typical for Effect etc . This well known fact led us to the idea of creating a program as a tool for in ~ troducing verbal frames  ( to be used even by researchers without deep l inguistic training  ) based on correspondences between sur~face and deep case E  ;  . Atf ~ rst we sorted the Czech v ~ rb ~ into four groups : i  . Verbs without Nominative in their frames . 
Examples : pr ~ i \ [ ( it ) rains\]hudlmi ( Act ( Dat )   ) vhlav ~\[ ( it ) is buzzing to meinhead \] ( my head is buzzing ) 
This group contains verbs with empty frames but also a few verbs with very untypical frames  . If the frame contains only one par~tic ipant  , then this is obviously an Actor . if there are at least two participants in the frame and one of them is Dative  , then this is the Actor . If , beside this , only one more participant occurs in the frame  , it is necessarily the Objective . All other verbs must be treated individually by a linguist as a kind of excep ~ tion  . 
2 . Verbs with Nominative and at most one more inner participant  . 
Examples : on(Act(Nora )) zemfel\[hedied\]
Jan ( Act ( Nora ) ) vidfi_ rii ( ob 3 ( Ace ) ) \[ John sees Mary \] ze semene ( Obj ( Prep ( z ) 4Gen )   ) rost lstrom ( Act ( Nora ) ) \[ from a seed grew a tree \] to ( obj ( Nora ) ) se mi ( Act ( Dat )   ) libl\[it tome appeals \] ( I like it ) 

vy ~ .
Accoi'diil % ( to the the ~) ~' y , if the frame contains ' ; only one partici-pant , it is Actor ,  . if it contains two part ~ cipants ~ one of them is
Actor and theothe ~: is Objective.
Nominative usually represents the
Actor but there is an exception to this rule : if the other par~ticipant is in Dative  , then this participant is the Actor and the
Nominative represents the Objective . Reasonability of this ex-ceptiot call be proved by trans-lating particular verbs into other languages  , ~ n  which the surface frames are different while there is no obvious reason why the deep frames should dif-fer ~ Thuse  . g . the verb libitse has Nominative/Clause and Dative in its surface framewhile in the frame of the corresponding Eng-lish verb to l ike there are Subject and obj cot/clause  , where subject corresponds to Czech
Dative and object to Nominative.
3 . Verbs with Nominative and two or more other inner participants  , which occur only in " typical " cases ( i . e ~ Accusative , Dative , z + Genitive , od + Genitive , na+Accu-sative , do 4Accusative , v+Accusa-tive ) oA verb belongs to this group even if some of the slots for inner participants can be occupied either by a typical case or any other  ( prepositional ) case o~-a clause or infinitive . 
Examples -" dan ( Act ( Nom )   ) dal Ma-rii ( Addr ( Dat )   ) knihu ( Obj ( Acc )   ) \[ John gave Mary a book \]
Otec ( Act ( Nora ) ) ud~lal d ~ ~ o tern ( Addr ( Dat )   ) zedfeva ( Orig ( Prep ( z ) + Gen )   ) pan~d-ka ( Obj ( Ace ) ) \[ father made t ( ~ children out of wood a puppet \]
The verbs ( , fth ~ third group behave " typioi ~ l\]y " v wh ich means that Nominative represents the 
Actor , Accusative the objective,
Dative the Addressee et Co4 . othe ~', i . e o verbs with Nomi-native and twt ) or more other A ( :H ; SDI ' ; COLINGO2 , NANTES , 2328 aO~\]l 199288'/Pl~ol: . o , . COLING ~92, NANII ! S,AU(; .  2328 , 1992 inner participants , which occur not only in typical cases . 
Examples : ~ f ( Act ( Nom )   ) jmenoval Ja-na ( Obj ( Acc )   ) z ~ stup-cem ( Eff ( In str )   ) \[ boss appointed John a deputy \]
Jan ( Act ( Nora ) ) obkl opil Ma-rii ( Addr ( Acc )   ) p ~ dl ( Obj ( In str )   ) \[ John surrounded Mary with care \]
In this group Nominative always represents Actor but for determining other participants it is necessary to take into account an additional aspect  , namely the prototypical character of the animacy of the participants  ; this enables us to distinguish the dif ference between deep frames of the two last example sj menovatan dobklopit  . The surface frames are identical : Nominative , Accus-ative and Instrumental , but while the verb jmenovath as Accusative standing for the Objective and 
Instrumental for the Effect , the verb obklop it has Accusative standing for the function of 
Addressee and In@trumental for the function of Objective  . 
Algoritbmisation
The algorithms for the verbs of the first two groups were described in the previous paragraph  . 
The possible algorithmiza-tion of determining the correspondences between " surface " and " deep " cases of the verbs of the last two groups can be seen from the following table of several 
Czech verbs with different frames :

In strmake take ge task ( for ) change pay inherit talk know connect congratu late surround become appoin task  ( for ) speak help as kask ( for ) bet
We can see that the prepositional cases " typical " for Origin occur only in the position of Origin  , and Dative occurs only in the position of Addressee  . After these members of the surface frame are determined  , in most cases only one undetermined par-tic ipant remains  , which must be
Objective . If two or three par-ticipants are remaining we have to take into account the animacy ACRESDE  COLING-92  , NANTES , 2328 A Otlr 1992888 PROC . OFCOLING-92 . NANTES , AUG .  2328 ,  1992  ( typical for Addressee ) and in-animacy of the participants and the set of prepositional cases which are typical for Effect  . 
This algorithm is used in a program which reads Czech verbs from an input file and asks al inguist  ( in the interactive regime ) to fill in the surface verbal frame . 
conclusions
Some general linguistic statements concerning relations between " centre "  ( prototypes ) and " periphery " ( marginality ) in the domain of verb and its valency could be in ferred from an appli-cation of the rules presented in our paper  . In " nominative " languages the verbal frame ~ t Obj 
Addr can be considered as central ( while e . g . Aat ( Obj ) Addr is not typical ) . Moreover , the correspondences between US and SS as
Act->Nom , Obj -> Ace , Addr ->
Dat can be treated as prototypes ( while e . g . correspondences Act->DatrAddr-~Ace , Obj->Instroccur in Czech as marginal) . The strategy of our algorithm is based princ ipally on an observa-tion of this type  . We assume that this method can be easily adapted for any other inflectional language and perhaps also for such languages as English  . Languages may differ as to correspondences between a particular deep case  ( US ) and its surface ( morphemic form )  , but the idea of prototypi-cal and marginal re lations seems to be valid and is supported by the algorithmic procedure for determining these correspondences  .
