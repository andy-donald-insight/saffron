This paper introduces a description language for syntactically annotated corpora which allows for encoding both the syntactic annotation to a corpus and the queries to a syntactically annotated corpus  . 
In terms of descriptive adequacy and computational efficiency  , the description language is a compromise between script-like corpus query languages and high -level  , typed unification-based grammar formalisms . 
1 Introduction
Syntactically annotated corpora like the Penn Treebank  ( Marcus et al ,  1993) , the NeGra corpus ( Skut et al ,  1998 ) or the statistically dismnbiguated parses in ( Bell et al . , 1999) provide a wealth of intbrmation , which can only be exploited with an adequate query language  . For example , one might want to retrieve verbs with their sentential complements  , or specific fronting or extraposition phenomena . So far , queries to a treebank have been formulated in scripting languages like tgrep  , Perlor others . Recently , some powerful query languages have been developed : an exaln ple of a high-level  , constraint-based language is described in ( Duchier and Niehren ,  1999) . ( Bird et al ,  2000 ) propose a query language for the general concept of annotation grat  ) hs , , A graphical query notation tbr trees is under development in the ICE project  ( UCL ,  2000) . 
In the current paper , we present a proposal for a graph description language which is meant to fulfill two conflicting requirements : On the one hand  , the language should be close to traditional linguistic descriptions languages  , i . e . to grammar formalisms , as a basis for modular , understandable code , even for complex corpus queries . On the other lmnd , the language should not preclude etlicient query evaluation  . Our answer is to profit from the research on typed  , feature-based/constraint-based grammar t brmalisms  ( e . g . ( Carpenter ,  1992) , ( Copestake ,  1999) , ( DSrre and Dorna ,  1993) , ( D6I're et al ,  1996) , ( Emele and Zajac ,  1990) , ( H6ht~ld and Smolka ,  1988)) , and to pick those ingredients which are known to be con~i  ) utationally ' tractable ' in some sense . 
2 The Query Language 2 . 1 The r ight k ind of graphs If syntactic analysis is meant to provide for a basis of semantic interpretation  , the predicate-argulnent structure of a sentence nmst be recoverable fi'om its syntactic analysis  . Nonlocal dependencies like topicalization , right extraposition , tell us that tr'ccs are not expressive nough . We need a way to connect an extraposed constituent with its syntactic resp  . semantic head . This can be done either by introducing empty leaf nodes plus a means for node coreference  ( like in the Penn Treebank ) or by admitting crossing edges . In our project , the latter solution has been chosen ( Skut et al ,  1997) , partly tbr the reason that it is simpler to annotate  ( no decision on the right place of a trace has to be taken  )  . We call this extension of trees with crossing edge syntazgraphs  . An example is shown in Fig .  1 . 
In order to discuss the details of the language , we will make reference to the simpler syntax graph in Fig  .  2 .

In computational linguistics , t ~ ature structures are used for that purpose . Since we need only a way to represent morphosyntactic information  ( not Syll-tactic or semantic structures ) themselves , we restrict ourselves to feature records , i . e . fi at ; feature structures whose t bature values are constants  . We admit Booleant brmulas , t br the fl . ' ature values , as well as tbr the feature-value pairs themselves . 
For example , all proper nouns ( " NE " ) and nouns ( " NN " ) can be retrieved by \[ pos="NE"I"NN"\]As usual  , strucl ; ura \] identity ca . n be expressed by the use of logical variables . However , variables must not occur in the SCO l ) e of negation , since this would introduce the colnlmtational overhead of inequality constraints  . 
The values of a feature with ' in finite ' range like word or  1emma can be referred to by regular exl ) ressions , e . g . the nouns ( " NN " ) with initial M can be retrieved by \[ word =/^ M  . */& pos="NN"\]The/-symbols in ark a regular expression  . 
2.3 Node relations
Since gral ) hs are two-dimensional objects , we need one basic node relation t breach dimension  , direct precedence . for the horizontal dilnension and direct dominance > t br the vertical dimension  ( the precedence of two inner nodes is defined as the precedence and KS nig  , 2000a ) ) Some convenient derived node relations are the following : > * dominance  ( minimum path length 1 ) > n dominance in n steps ( n > 0 ) > m , n dominance between ~ n , and n steps ( 0 < m < n ) > Olleftmosterminal successor ( ' left corner ' ) >@ rrightmosterminal successor ( ' right corner ' ) ?* precedence ( minimum n mn be r of intervals : 1 ) ? n precedence with r t intervals ( n > 0 ) ? m , n precedence between m and ' n , intervals (0 < m <$ siblings $ . * siblings with precedence 2 . 4 Graph descr ip t ions We admit restricted 13oolean expressions over node relations , i . e . conjunction and disjunction , but no negation . For exam I ) le , tile queries#nl:\[word="ein " ~ pos="ART"\]  #   n2: \[ word="Mann "& pos="NN"\]#nl# n2 and#nl:\[cat="NP"\]>"NK"\[pos="kRT " \]&#nl>"NK"\[word="Mann"\]art both satisfied by the NP-constituent in Fig  .  2 .  #nl ,  #n2 art variables . Tile symbol " NR " is an edge label . Edges can be labelled in order to indicate the syntactic relation between two nodes  . 
2.5 Types
Fortilet ) urpose of conceptual chuity , tile user can define type hierarchies . ' Subtylle S : may also be constants e . g . like in the case of part-of-speech symbols . Here is all excerpt from the type hierarchy tbr the STTS tagset : nominal := noun  , properNoun , pronoun . 
noun := " NN".
proper Noun := " NE " .
pronoun "= " PPPER "," PPOS "," PRELS ", . . .   . 
This hierarchy can be used to t brmulate queries in a more concise manner :\[ pos = nominal \]  . *\[ pos="VVFIN"\]2 . 6 Templates E . g . Ibra concrete lexicon acquisition task , one might have to define a collection of interdependent  , comI ) lex queries . In order tokeel ) tile resulting code tractable and reusable , queries call be organised into teln-plates ( oim acros )  . Templates can take logical variables as arguments and may refer to other temi  ) lates , as long as there is no ( embedded ) self reference . Logically , templates art offline-compilable Horn fbrmula . 
Here are some examplest br template definitions . A simple notion of Verb Phrase is being de . fined with reference to a notion of
Prep Phrase.

Verb Phrase ( #nO:\[cat="VP"\]>#nl:\[pos="VVFIN"\] #nO > #  n2 & #nl . #n2) <-

Language 3 . 1 Corpus annotation vs . queries Actually , the query language is rather adc- , scription language which ( : an 1 ) e used also for encoding the syntactic annotation of a corpus  . \] n the current proje , ct , a SylltaC-tically disambiguated corpus is being 1 ) re-duced . This means , that , for corl ) us annotation , only a sublanguage of the i ) rol ) osed language is adnlissibh ' , with the following re-strict ; ions : ? The graph ( ; oll straillt SI llay only inclu(le the , t ) asi (: node relations (> ,   . ) .

Thus , we have developed an XML based format which guarantees maxim mn  1  ) or tabil-ity ( Mengel and Lezius ,  2000) . An online (' on version tool ( Ne Ora , Penn Treebank -+ XML ) is availabh ' , on our project home page . 
4: Formal Semantics
Compared to most other corpus description and corpus query languages  , o111 graph ( te-scription language comes with aibrmal and a clear cut operational semantics  , which has been described illatechnical report ( Lez-illsanti KS nig , 2000a ) . The semantics has been compiled from the correslmntling parts of t brmal semantics of the typed  , unification-based gramlnar tbrmalisms and constraint-based logic programming languages which have been cited above  . Due to the , fact that the corpus slid the query are repre-se , nted in the same description language , one Call detillea ( ; oi1se ( tllellce relation ) et\ve ell the corl ) uS and the query . Essentially , the annotated cortms corresponds to a Prolog database  , and the corpus query to a Prolog query . A query result is a syntax graph from the tort ) us . 
5 Implementation
One might argue that commercial and research implementations t br structurally annotated texts are already available  , i . e . 
XML-retrieval systems , e.f . ( LTG , 1999).
However , we intend to solve t ) rol ) lems which are spe ( ' if i ( " to natural language descriptions : non-eml ) e ( t ( ling ( non-tree-lilw , ) structm ' al annotations crossing edge , s and , on the long-texm , re , trieval of coindexed sul . ) structures ( co-refl ; rence phenomena ) . A domain-specific impleme , ntation of the search engine gives the basis for opti-inizations wrt  . linguistic applications ( Lezius and KSnig ,  20001)) . 
Before queries can be ( wahlate . d on a new corl ) uS(e . n coded in the NeGra , Penn Treebank or XML format) , a preprocessing tool has to convert it into the format of the description language  . Subsequently , the colpus is indexed in order to guarantee efficient lookups during the query evaluation  . The query processor to date is cal ) able of evaluating 1 ) asic queries ( cf . Sect .  2 . 2-2 . 4) . .To support all popular platforms , the tool is implemented in Jaw L There , is a servlet available on the project web page which illustrates the  , cuir (: nt stage of the implementation . 


Syntactic or pus annotations , complex corpus queries and comt ) utational grammars have one common point : they are descriptions of natural anguage grammars  . Our claim is that corpus query languages should be close to traditional grammar fbrmalisins in order to make complicated information extraction tasks easier to encode  . The level of processing efficiency of scripting languages can still be reached if one restricts one self to ' offline ' compilable language lements only  .
