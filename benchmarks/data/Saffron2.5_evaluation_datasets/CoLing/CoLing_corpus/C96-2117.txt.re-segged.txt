This paper presents a way to compute relative social status of the individuals involved in Korean dialogue  . Every Korean sentence indicates whether honorification occurs in it  . 
The occurrence of honorification in a sentence is constrained by relative social status of the individuals involved in the sentence  . 
By using the intbrmation about social status and the information about sentence-external individual such as speaker and addressee  , we can explain why a sentence is felicitous in a restricted context and whether a dialogue is coherent or not  . Since it is possible and easy to include such contextual intormation in the IfPSG formalism  , that formalism is adopted here . The implementation fKore andialogue processing and the computation of social status is made based on ALE system  . 
1 Preliminaries
In the conventional approach to honorification in Korcan  , attention has becn paid to subject honorifica -tion and a scntenc c itself though the Korean honorifi-cation system consists of three types of honorifica-tion  ( that is , subject honorification , object honorifiea-tion , and addrcs sechonorification ) and the scntence-external individuals ( i . c . , speaker and addressce ) play an important role in the honorification system  . 
In our approach speaker and addrcs sceare specified for cachs cut cncc and all thrce types of honorification arcc  ( ms idcred simnltancously . In addition the appro-ach uses the inlormation about the sentence-external individuals as well as the individuals mentioned in a sentence to compute relative social status  . In Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar ( HPSG )   ( Pollard and Sag ,  1994 ) the information about speaker and addressee can be included in a lexical sign and thus thai: grammar formalism is adopted in our approach  . 
This paper shows how to compute relative social status  o1' the persons involved in a dialogue which is a series of sentences  . The attempt to compute social status of the individttals involved in a dialogue has never been made betbre  . A dialogue processing and the computatiou of relative social status a reimple-in entcd using the system of ALE  ( Carpenter and
Penn , 1995).
Knowledge of honorific morphemes in Korean is requisite to the inference of social status and thus it is explained in Section  2  . The problem with the previous approach and the reason why a sign-based appro-ach is suitable to the computation of social status are presented in Section  3  . Section 4 deals with the inference of social status in a coherent dialogue and the detection of an incoherent dialogue  . Section 5 presents the implementation f dialogue parsing and the computation of relative social status within the ALE system  . Finally in Section 6 the importance of the contextual information and the advantages of our approach ale discussed  . 
2 Morphemes Relevant to

Depending on who is respected by speaker , the hono-rification type is determined ( for example , when a subject referent , an ohject referent , and addressee are honored by speaker , subject honorification , object honorification , and addressee honorification occur , respectively ) . The linguistic realization of these types of honorifieation is manifested by specific morphe -messuch as an honorific suffix  , honorific case markers , an honorific infix , honorific verbal endings , and hmnble verb forms . Let us look at them one by one . 
First , when the honorific suffix him attaches to an NP , the referent of the NP is respected by speaker . 
Second , if an honorific case marker is used , the referent of the NP to which the honorific case market " attaches is respected by speaker  . Plain(i . e . , nonhonorific ) case market's and honorific case markers corresponding to them are as shown in  ( 1 )  . 
(1 ) Case Markers -~_ nominative genitive plain ka , iuy h0 nol'ifick keyse dative accusative . e . y key . u . ! , hflkkcy Sincen either an honorific genitive case marker nor an honorific accusative case marker exists  , the referent of a genitive NP or an accusative NP is respected when the genitive NP or the accusative NP contains the honorific suffix nim  . It is also possible to attach both the honorific suffix nimandan honorific case marker to an NP  . 
Third , the honorific infix si appearing in a verb indicates that the referent of a subject NP is respected by speaker  . 

Fourth , honorific verbal endings indicate that speaker shows honor or courtesy to addressee  . The plain verbal endings and honorific verbal endings are as illustrated in  ( 2 )  . 
(2) a . Declarative Verbal Ending formal informal plain tae  , a honorific ( su)pnita((y)e ) yob . Interrogative Verbal Ending formal informal plain  ( nu ) nkahi , e , a honorific ( su ) pnikka ( ( y ) e ) yo The relationship between speaker and addressee determines whether a formal verbal ending or an informal verbal ending can be used  . For example , when a conversation is made between friends , an informal verbal ending is used . On the other hand , when a businessman talks to another businessman , a formal verbal ending is used . 
An honorific verbal ending is used when the social status of addressee is higher than that of speaker  ( in this case speaker shows honor to addressee ) or when the social status of speaker is higher than that of addressee  ( in this case speaker shows courtesy to addressee )  . Thus from an honorific verbal ending we can infer that the social status of speaker and addressee is not equal  . 
Finally , the use of a humble verb form indicates that an object referent is respected by speaker and that the social status of an object referent is higher than that of a subject referent  . 
3 Background and Framework
Without considering the extrasentential ndividuals such as speaker and addressee  , it is not possible to compute relative social status of the persons involved in a sentence  . 
3.1 Previous Work
All earlier works ( Kim , 1988; Kuno and Kim , 1985; Suh ,  1978 ) we redone about subject honorification i the frame of pure syntactic theory  . Their claim is that there is a syntactic agreement between a subject NP and its corresponding verb  . In other words , if an honorific morpheme attaches to a subject NP  , the ho-norific infix si must appear in a verb as shown in  ( 3 )  . 
(3) Hart sensayng-nim-io-si-ess-ta.
teacher-hon-nomcome-hon-past-dec'Teacher Han came  . ' As far as subject honorification is concerned , their assertion is correct . Their approach , however , is incomplete and cannot be applied to the computation of social status for the following reasons  . 
First , every sentence has a verb . Addressee honori-fication is indicated in a verb . Subject honorification is manifested in a subject NP and a verb  . Thus even if a sentence itself is looked at , it is necessary to consider both addressee honorification and subject honori-fication  . 
Second , the consideration of a sentence itself is not enough because honorification phenomenon is related to the sociolinguistic factor such as social status  . In their approach , it cannot be explained why the sentence in ( 4 ) instead of the sentence in ( 5 ) must be used when speaker has higher social status than the subject referent though the two sentences are equally grammatical  .

chief section-hon-nomgo out-hon-past-dec'Chief section Park went out  . ' Finally , it is not possible to compute social status at all just by the information that the subject referent who is mentioned in a sentence is respected  . In the computation of social status it is necessary to know the binary relation such as the person A is respected by the person B  . In the honorification system the person who respects others is always speaker  . Thus in computing social status speaker should be available  . Their approach , however , cannot gain access to speaker , who is a sentence-external individual because only a sentence itself is considered  . 
3.2 A Sign-Based Approach
In HPSG which adopts a sign-based approach , the information about sentence-external individual such as speaker and addressee as well as the information about the persons mentioned in a sentence can be included in a lexical sign  . The feattn-e structure of a lexical sign is as shown in  ( 6 )  .

The contextual information about social status and sentence-external individuals can bc included in the attribute CONTEXT  ( CONX )  . Ill order to see values the attribute CONTEXT may have  , let us consider the sentence in (7) . 
(7 ) J-kkeyse W-nim-ulnora ( hon ) hon-acc to watuli-si-ess-supnikka ? help ( hum ) -hon-past-int ( hon ) ' DidJhelp W ?' ( Speaker : K , Addressee : L ) Since the LOCAL ( LOC ) value of the constituents appearing in ( 7 ) is relevant o our discussion , it is considered . 
First , the LOCAL value of the constituent J-k keyse is as shown in  ( 8 ) because the honorific nominative case marker k keyse attaches to the  subje6t NPJ .

LPOLAR rrYI-IThe diagram in ( 10 ) provides the contextual information that speaker respects an object referent and a subject referent  , that the social status of the object referent and the subject referent is higher than that of speaker and addressee  , and that the object referent has higher social status than the subject referent  . In addition , it supplies the information that the social status of speaker is not equal to that of addressee  . 

As shown in diagrams (810) , there is no conflict in the information provided by the attribute CONTEXT  . 
From the information supplied by the attribute S -STATUS we can infer that \[~>\[~\]> l'~l  , \[>\[~\] > l " g'l , and \[~ ( where ' > ' and ' e'stand for the relation ' higher than ' and ' not equal to '  , respectively ) . Thus the sentence in ( 7 ) is felicitous in the context where the social status of the object referent is higher than that of any other individuals involved in the sentence  , where the social status of the subject referent is higher than that of speaker and addressee  , and where the social status of speaker is not equal to that of addressee  . 
Within a sentence speaker and addressee do not change  . This factiSguaranteed by the Contextual Indices Inheritance Principle shown in  ( 11 )  . 
( ll ) Contextual Indices Inheritance Principle : The CONXTC-INDICES value of a given phrase is token -identical to that of any of its daughters  . 
The information about who honors whom and about relative social status of the individuals involved in a sentence is collected at sentence level by the Background and Social Status Consistency Principle stated in  ( 12 )  . 
(12) Background and Social Status Consistency
Principle:
The CONXIBACKGR value and the CONXIS-STA-TUS value of a given phrase are the collection of the CONXIBACKGR values and the CONXIS-STA-TUS values of all its daughters  , respectively . 
Thus within a sign-based approach it is possible to compute relative social status on the basis of the collected relations of social status  . The information about relative social status provides the context in which a sentence is felicitous  . 
4 Inference of Relative Social Status
Relative social status of the individuals involved in a dialogue can be inferred by collecting and computing the relations of social status collected at sentence level  . 
4 . 1 Template for a Relation of Social Status When a subject referent or an object referent is respected by speaker  , the social status of the subject referent or the object referent is higher than that of both speaker and addressee as formalized in  ( 13 )  . 
(13) Inds/o>Inds p,Inds/o>Indad
On the other hand , if a subject referent or an object referent is not respected by speaker  , the social status of speaker is equal to or higher than that of the subject referent or the object referent as shown in  ( 14 )  . 
(14) Inds p > Ind s/o
When a humble form of a verb is used in a sentence  , the social status of an object referent is higher than that of any other individuals  ( that is , speaker , addressee , and a subjeCt referent ) involved in a sentence as represented in ( 15 )  . 
(15) Indo > Ind sp , Indo > Indad , In do > Inds If a humble form of a verb is available but is not used  , the social status of speaker is equal to or higher than that of an object referent as illustrated in  ( 16 )  . 
(16) Inds p > Indo
When the honorific infix si occurs in a verb , the social status of a subject referent is higher than that of speaker and addressee as represented in  ( 17 )  . 
(17) Inds > Ind sp , Inds > Indad
If the honorific infix si does not occur in a verb  , the social status of speaker is equal to or higher than that of a subject referent as shown in  ( l8 )  . 
(18) Inds p > Inds
Finally , when an honorific verbal ending is used , the social status of speaker is different from that of addressee as illustrated in  ( 19 )  . 
(19) Inds p~Indad
If a plain verbal ending is used , the social status of speaker is equal to or higher than that of addressee as shown in  ( 20 )  . 
(20) Inds p > Indad 4 . 2 Inference in a Coherent Dialogue By a coherent dialogue we mean that there is no conflicting inference of social status from the sentences occurring in the dialogue  . Let us look at the dialogue shown in (2l ) . 
(21) a . K-kkeyse hoyuy-ey nom ( hon ) meeting-postp chamsek ha-si-ess-eyo . 
attend-boa-past-dec ( hon ) ' K attended at the meeting . '( Speaker : S , Addressee : L)b . P-k keyse K-nim-ul to watuli-si-es s-e . 
nom ( hon ) hon-acchelp ( hum ) -hon-past-dec'Phelped K . '( Speaker : L , Addressee : S)c . S-nunP-nim-ul poy-ess-ni ? tophon-accme et ( hum ) -past-int ' DidSmeetP ?' ( Speaker : L , Addressee : S ) The above dialogue occurs between the person S and the person L  . In their utterance the person K and the person P are mentioned  . Let us infer the relative social status of those four persons  . From the sentence ( 21 a ) the order in ( 22 ) is drawn . 
(22) K > S,K>L,S~L
Similarly , the orders shown in ( 23 ) and ( 24 ) are derived from the sentences ( 21b ) and ( 21c )  , respectively . 
(23) P > L,P > S ,
K > L , K > S , K > P , L_>S(24) L>S , P > L , P > S into the one illustrated in (25) . 
(25) K > P > L > S
So the relative order of social status shown in ( 25 ) is derived fi ' om the dialogue in ( 21 )  . 
4.3 Detection of an Incoherent Dialogue
It is possible to recognize whether a sentence in a dialogue is consistent with the previous sentence  ( s ) with respect o the honorification of a certain person  . 
Let us consider the dialogue shown in (26).
(26) a . R-kkeyse M-kkeynom ( hon ) dat ( hon ) sikyey-lulsens a ha-sbess-e . 
clock-acc present-hon-past-dec'R presemed a clock to M  . ' ( Speaker : Youngsoo , Addressee : Sungmin ) b . Heesoo-ka M-ulman na-ss-ni ? nor a accmeet-past -int ' Did Hee soome et M ?'  ( Speaker : Sungmin , Addressee : Youngsoo ) In the sentence ( 26 a ) four persons are involved : Young soo , Sungmin , the person R , and the person M . The order of their relative social status is as illustrated in  ( 27 )  . 
(27) R > Youngsoo , R > Sungmin,
M>Youngsoo , M > Sungmin,
R > M , Yot mg soo > Sungmin
Likewise , from ( 26 b ) we draw the relative order shown in ( 28 )  . 
(28) Sungmin > Heesoo , Sungmin > M,


It is derived from sentence ( 26 a ) that the social status of M is higher than that of Sungmin as shown in  ( 27 )  , whereas it is derived from ( 26 b ) that the social status of M is not higher than that of Sungmin as illustrated in  ( 28 )  . The latter derivation cannot be compatible with the former derivation  . Thus the dialogue in ( 26 ) is not coherent with respect othe honor it ' ication of the person M  . This kind of inco-herence can be detected only by considering relative social status of the individuals involved in a dialogue  . 
5 Implementation
To compute relative social status of the individuals involved in a dialogue  , the dialogue should be parsed and contextual information about social status must be available at dialogue level  . 
5.1 Dialogue Parsing
In ALE the primary predicate for parsing is ' rec  '  . For example , the query for parsing the sentence in ( 29 ) should have the format illustrated in ( 30 )  . 
(29) Soonchul-i Min young-ulman na-ss-e.
no mace meet-past-dec'So on chulmet Min young . ' ( Speaker : Mansoo , Addressee : Chulho ) (30)\]?-ree\[mansoo , chulho , so on chul_i , min young_ul , maxma_sse\] . 
As shown in the query , the first member of the input list is speaker of the input sentence  , the second lnem-ber of the input list is addressee  , and the remaining members are the constituents of the input sentence  . 
Although the indexes of speaker and addressee are variables in the entry of lexicons  , these variables are instantiated to speaker and addressee specified in the input string when a sentence is parsed  . 
A dialogue is composed of sentences . As a device of linking sentences , the conjunctive kuliko ' and ' is used . The conjunctive , however , does not contribute anything to a dialogue . For instance , the query for parsing the dialogue in ( 21 ) is its illustrated in ( 31 )  . 
(31) J ?- rec\[s , l , kk keyse , hoyu yel . ' , chamse k hasi esse yo , kuliko , i , s , p_k k e y s e , knim_ul , to watulisies ~_ e , kuliko , l , s , snun , pnimul , poyesshi \] . 
As shown in (31) , the conjunctive kuliko is not inserted after the last sentence in a dialogue because no further sentence follows  . In query ( 3 l ) both speaker and addressee arc specified for each sentence  . 
Since a series of sentences forms a dialogue , the feature structure of a dialoguc is its shown in  ( 32 )  . 
(32 ) VCOMPOSED-OF list of sentence-signs q\]BACKGR set of background l  \[2S-STA'rUS set of socials ' tatus_\] The value of the feature COMPOSEI  ) -OF is a list . Each member of the list is the result of parsing each sentence occurring in a dialogue  . On the other hand , the value of the feature IIACKGP , iS a set . Each element of the set contains the inlormation about who honors whom  , which is collected during a parsing of each sentence in a dialogue  . The value of the feature S-STATIJS is also a set whose elements provide the information about relative social status of the persons involved in a dialogue  . 
5 . 2 Computation of Relative Social Status All pieces of information that are necessary for the computation of social status are stored in the value of the feature S-STATUS  . l . etus consider how relative social status is computed using the dialogue in  ( 21 )  . 
When a dialogue is processed , the inlormation about relative social status is provided in the form of feature structure  . Feature structures are converted into Prolog facts since the reasoning component comprised of inference rules accepts Prolog facts  , not feature structures . In the case of dialogue (21) , the Prolog facts shown in (33) are obtained . 
(33) a . higher ( k , s ), higher ( k , l).
b . not_equal(I , s).
c.higher(p,I ), higher(p , s).
d . higher ( k , p).
697 e . equal_higher(I , s).
When the inference rule in ( 34 ) is applied to ( 33 b ) and ( 33 e )  , the result is (35) . 
(34) higher ( X , Y ) if % X > Y not_equal(X , Y ) , % X ? Y equal_higher(X , Y ) . % XkY (35) higher ( I,s) . 
When the inference rule in ( 36 ) is applied to ( 33 c ) and ( 33 d )  , the results are (37) and (38) . 
(36) higher inf three ( X , Y , Z ) if % X > Y > Z higher(X , Y ) , % X > Y higher(Y , Z ) . % Y > Z (37) higher_inf_three(k,p,i) . 
(38) higher_inf_three(k , s).
Finally when the inference rule in ( 39 ) is applied to ( 37 ) and ( 35 )  , the result is as shown in (40) . 
(39) higher_inf four(X , Y , Z , W ) if % X > Y > Z > Whigher_inf_t1 ~ ree(X , Y , Z ) , % X > Y > Z higher ( Z , W ) . % Z > W (40) higher inf four(k , l , s) . 
Thus the inference in ( 40 ) is the result of computing relative social status of the individuals involved in dialogue  ( 21 )  . 
5.3 Conflicting Inference
Let us consider why the dialogue in ( 26 ) is not coherent . After the dialogue is parsed , the feature structures in ( 41 ) are collected together with other feature structures  . 
(41) a . S_STATUS highers status
HIGHERm
LOWER smb . S_STATUS equal_highers status
EQUAL_HIGHER sm
EQUAL_LOWERm
The Prolog facts in ( 42 a ) and ( 42b ) are obtained from the feature structures in ( 41 a ) and ( 41b )  , respectively . 
(42) a . higher ( m , sra).
b . equal_higher(s in , m).
The two facts , however , are not compatible because higher ( ra , sin ) means ' not equal_higher(sm , m ) ' . 
Thus dialogue ( 26 ) is incoherent in that the relative order of social status between the person M whose index is m and the person Sungmin whose index is sm is not consistent  . 
6 Concluding Remarks
In this paper we have discussed a method to compute relative social status of the individuals involved in a dialogue  . The main points are as follows : First , the problem with previous works is that they cannot incorporate sentence-external individuals uchas speaker and addressee in honorification phenomenon because just a sentence itself is considered  . 
Second , since the Korean honorification system consists of subject honorification  , object honorifi-cation and addressee honorification  , these types of honorification should be considered simultaneously when we look at a sentence  . 
Finally , sentence-external individual set the criteria for all relations of social status and thus they should be available in the computation of social status  . 
Our approach makes good use of contextual information such as information about social status and sentence-external individuals  . The advantages of including contextual information in the implementation are that it is possible to catch the context where a sentence is felicitous and it is also possible to detect whether a dialogue is coherent  . If a dialogue is coherent , he order of the social status of the indivi-duals involved in the dialogue is produced  , whereas when a dialogue is found in coherent , the reason for incoherence is produced . Our approach sets a new direction of processing Korean in that it considers and implements he important fact that a Korean sentence is constrained by relative social status of the indivi-duals involved in the sentence  .
