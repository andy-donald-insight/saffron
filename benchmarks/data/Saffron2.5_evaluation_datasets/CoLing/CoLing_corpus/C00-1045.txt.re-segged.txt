Abstract
Pronoln inalization has been related to tile idea of a local focus-a set of discourse entities in the speaker's centre of attention  , for exmnple ill Gundel et al ( 1993 ) 's givenness hierarchy or in centering theory . Both account say that the determination of tile tb cus depends on syntactic as well as pragmatic factors  , but have not been able top in those factors down . In this paper , we uncover the major factors which determine the focusset in descriptive texts  . This new tb cus definition has been ew , luated with respect to two corporm museum exhibit labels  , midnews paper mtieles . It provides an opera-tionalizable basis for pronoun production  , and has been implemented as the reusable module gnome-np  . The algorithm l ) ehind gnome-np is conlpared with the most recent pronoun generation algorithm of McCoy and Strube  ( 1999 )  . 
1 Introduction
Besides the well established problem of ln'o noun resolution  , pronoun generation is now attracting renewed attention  . In the past , generation systelns generated pronouns without attaching much importance to the problem  , one notable exception being the classical algorithm of Dale  ( 1990 )  , loosely based on centering theory . With the emergence of corpus based studies in comtm-rational linguistics  , the question arises whether it is possible to refine known standard algorithms  , or whether an improvement is only to be achieved with the hell  ) of world knowledge reasoning-a matter too complex to be dealt with reliably at this time  . Tile Ibrlner direction is represented by tile pioneering work of McCoy and Strube  ( 1999 )  . They propose a refined algorithm fortile choice between definite description on the one hand and pronoun on the other for * The work reported in this paper has been calmed out with the tinancial support of UKES PllC grant  L51126  . 
animate referents I , which is based on distancG time structure mid ambiguity constraints  . 
Here we introduce a more general algoritln n for the pronominalization decision that is valid not only for animate but for inanimate referents as well  . In conformity with McCoy and Strube , we group noun phrases with definite determiner and propernalnestogether undertile term " det ' -inite description "  . The algorithm proposes a new pronominalization strategy  , which beyond McCoy and Strube ( 1999 ) 's criteria makes use of the discom'sestatus of the antecedent and parallelism effects  . 
The algorithm has been implemented as the reusable module gnome-np  . It has been reused in tile web hypertext generation system ILEX  ( see Oberlander el ; al .  (1998)) . It shows ml accuracy over 87% with respect otwo corpora ( each 5000 words ) of difl'erent genres . 
2 Accounts of pronominalization
In previous ace ( rants pronominalization has been related to the idea of a local focus of ~ d  ; -tention : a set of discourse referents who/wl fich is in the center of attention of the speaker  ( e . g . 
Sidner (1979) , givenness hierarchy ( Gun(lel et al . , 1993) , centering theory ( Grosz et al ,  1995) , RAFT/RAPId . ( Suri , 1993)) . Whereas ( Gundelel ; al . , 1993 ) do not atteml ) t to make their focus notion operationalizable , this has been attempted by fllrther develolmlents of centering  . 
However these have mostly been applied to the pronoun resolution problem  . In the following we discuss three versions of centering and show that their application to the pronoun generation problem is nevertheless l in fited  . 
Centering . Centering was developed to explain local discourse coherence  ; the extent to which it benefits pronoun generation is however not immediately clear  , hicentering ,   1We ll SO the terms " discours entity " and " refc ' rent " synonymously in this paper  .

It is based on a new definition of the local focus  , which views the discourse status of the antecedent as the major motivation behind focusing  . The algorithm performs equally well when applied to McCoy and Strube's corpus of newspaper articles  . 
3 Corpus analysis
The algorithm we will present below has been developed in close relation to the MUSE corpus- a corpus of museum exhibit labels a  . The corpus is a collection of web pages of the Paul Getty Museum  , pages from an exhibition catalogue , and pages frol naje wellery book . Typical characteristics are tile central role of inanimate referents in these texts  , and the lack of temporal change thus providing an interesting counter-t  ) art to the news t ) a per genre investigated by Mc-
Coy and Strube.
With an overall set of around 5000 words , tile cortms contains 1450 NPs . Each NP has been annotated with respect o , among others , grammatical function , discourse status , gender , number , countability , and antecedent relationships . 
23% of the NPs form reference chains ( i . e . at least two mentions of one and the same referent in one text  )  , the other 77% are only mentioned once . We have 101 different reference chains ; the chain-fbrming NPs fall into 10\] discourse-new and 213 anaphoric NPs . In the following , we will only discuss the anaphoric NPs .   50% of the anaphoric NPs are realized as definite descriptions  , 50% as pronouns . We distinguish between locally bound pronouns , which are determined syntactically ( Binding Theory , ( Chore-sky ,  1981)) , and which we expect the tactical generator to handle correctly  , and pronouns which are not locally boundsocalled discourse pronouns  . We investigated possible colrelations between the discourse  1  ) ronouns and semantic/pragmatic features of their context  . 
The basic notions that we found were distance , discourse status of the antecedent , and grammatical function of the antecedent . All three notions need a precise definition . 
Distance . ~lbbeable to determine the distance between a discourse entity and its antecedent  , a precise determination f what counts 3UIL : http://www . hcrc . ed . ac . uk /' gnome / corpora as utterance unit is necessary  . Following Kameyama (1998) , we take as utterance unit the finite clause , lelative clauses and con > plenmnt clauses are not counted as utterances on their own  . This means that we count clauses containing complement clauses or relative clauses as single utterances  .  4 , a The pre-vious utterance is the preceding utterance at the same level of embedding  . 
Note that we allow the treatment of clauses with VP coordination  ( subject ellipsis ) as complex coordinated clauses as done in Kameyalna  ( 1998 )  , thus handling subject ellipsis as a discourse pronoun  ; our algorithm does not ; insist on this view however . 
The following correlation between pronoun use and distance wast bund in our corpus :  97% of the pronouns have an antecedent in the same or the previous utterance  . 
Discourse status . The information status of a discoursentity in an utterance is either given or new  . We use these terms with an identical Lneaning as g ~ vn ' nd and focus in Vallduvi  ( 1993 )  . Discourse status , as introduced by Prince (1992) , is a similar but different notion : A discourse ntity is discourse-old  , if it has been mentioned before in the same discourse  ; it is discourse-new otherwise . All cases of givenness by indirect means like part-whole  , set-member relationships , other bridging relations , inferences ( Prince's inferrables , anchored and situationally evoked entities ) are judged as discourse-new , thus taking into account only tile identity antecedent relationship  . We share Prince's opinion that pronominalization has to do with discourse status  , whereas definiteness has to do with information status  . 
6 6% of all short-distance discourse pronouns in the MUSE corpus refer to an antecedent which is in itself discourse-old  . 
Subjecthood . The third strong correlation is the relation between pronoun use and the grmn-matical function of the antecedent  .   63% of discourse pronouns have a subject as antecedent  . 
The following table shows the overall distribution of antecedent properties for short-distance  4This deviates from Kameyama , who analyzes reported speech as separate utterance  .

Ambiguity . Along with McCoy and Strube we argue that ambiguity with respect to gen-der/number influences the pronominalization decision : members of the local fbcus which have a competing referent  ( refbrent with similar gen-der/number ) in some span to the left of the referent to be generated should not be realized as t  ) ronoun so as to minimize the inference load for the reader  . However , not to allow pronominalization in all ambiguous context situations does not ~ I  ) t ) ear to be consistent with real texts ( McCoy and Strube ,  1999) . In the MUSE cortms one third of all focal NPs occur in ambiguous contexts  , one half of them is pronominalized , the other half is not . Two questions require a precise answer to use the ambiguity constraint in a generation algorithm : ? Which set of  1  ) reviously mentioned referents or texts t ) an is taken into account br referents to be in competition ? ? Which referents are pronominal iz cd despite an aln biguous context ? The answer is surprisingly simple : I/  . eferents of the previous utterance which are not in the local fbcus do not disturb pronominalization  , even if they have the stone gender/nm nber . Only if the actual referent has a competitor in the local fbcus  , is pronominalization blocked . This is illustrated in Figure 1 with exmnples ( 3 ) and ( 4 )  , respectively . In ( 3 ) the micro scope is discourse-old and the only member in the local focus for  ( u2 )  ; the competing referent socular micrvmc-tcr " mid technology are new and hence not local fbr utterance  ( u2 )  . In (4) , the local focus for ( u2) is the at , th , tl , el ,  . o'ascAslight improvement of the performance of the algorithm can be achieved by regarding the role of " heavy " nonrestrictive modification  . 
hm\]uding the referents of discom'se-new NPs which are amplified by appositions or nonre-strictive relative clauses into the set  ; of ' possible competitors improves accuracy slightly  . 
Discourse structure signalling . It is now known that detinite descriptions ( or more general overspecified NPs ) signal the start of a new discourse segment ( Passommau , 1996; Vonk et al . , 1992) . For most generation systems generate from an I/ST -like text  ; plan , discourse segments are naturally given . The only question fl ' om the generation perspective is the degree of detail provided by the segmentation  . 
Our algorithm gnome-up assumes that the discourse segmentation has already been specified  . At each segment boundary , the local focus is set to nil , thereby disallowing pronominal-ization for all discoursentities of the first utterance in the segment on set  . 
It is also wellknown that plmmed discourse with repeated phrases at the begim fing of a clause are seen as ' bad style '  . Identical repeated pronouns at the clause on set are rarely found in expository and descriptive texts  ( 2 . 6% of all discourse pronouns in our corpus ) . Hmnan writers usually avoid possibly dull lack of variation by employing various aggregation techniques  .

The Mgorithm , first , is implemented as a reusable module t br gener at ion systenls and  , second , provides a theoretical account of pronominal i zationi general  . 
The proposed algorithm provides a solution for question \[ ~ above by widening the defini-tion of local Ibcus to be a set with possibly more than one referent  . The Mgorithm also oilers a new solution fbr problem \[ ~ above  , aml ) igu-ous pronoun generation . Discom'se structuring ( ~\ ]  ) is assumed as given . A sufficiently finegrained discourse structuring has been explored  , for example , by McCoy and Strube fbr their do-nlmn of newspaper articles  , but remMns an issuef brfuture research fbrother domains  . We have shown that next to 1) roxilnity , the discourse status of the mlteced cnt is a main criterion for triggering pronomilm lization  . 
The suggested algorithm generalizes known fbcusing accounts  . Gundel et al (1993)'s cog-nitives lat , us of being " in fbcus " is now approximated by the set of all discourse-old entities and the subject of the previous utterance  . The new focus determination is also a general i zation of centering's Cb  . The focus so defined serves two functions s imultaneously : to trigger  1  ) ronomi-n Mization , and to provide the set ; of competitors for pronoun generation in ambiguous contexts  . 
Although our training corpus is too small to jus-tify general clMms  , the ewduation with respect to tile newspaper genre provides evidence that this finding is valid for planned discourse illgen-erM  , independent of the concrete genre .
