Abstract
In this paper we describe a method of classifying Japanese text documents using domain specific kanji charact crs  . Text documents are generally cb~s sified by significant words  ( keywords ) of the documents . 
However , it is difficult to extract these significant words from Japanese text  , because Japanese texts are written without using blank spaces  , such as delimiters , and must be segmented into words . Therefore , instead of words , we used domain specific kanji characters which appear more frequently in one domain than the other  . We extracted these domain specific kanji characters by X  , 2 method . Then , using these domain specific kanji characters , we clas-sifted editorial columns " TENSEIJING O  "  , edito-rim articles , and articles in " Scientific American ( in Japanese ) " . The correct recognition scores for ' them were 47%  ,  74% , and 85% , respectively . 
1 Introduction
Document cl~sification has been widely investigated for assigning domains to documents for text retrieval  , or aiding human editors in assigning such domains . 
Various successful systems have been developed to classify text documents  ( Blosseville , 1992; Guthrie , 1994; Ilamill , 1980; Mas and , 1992; Young ,  1985) . 
Conventional way to develop document classification systems can be divided into the following two groups :  1  . semantic approach 2 . statistical approach In the semantic approach , document classification is based on words and keywords of a thesaurus  . If the thesaurus i constructed well , high score is achieved . 
But this approach as disadvantages in terms of development and maintenance  . On the other hand , in the statistical approach , a human exl ) ert classifies a sample set of documents into predefine domains  , and the computer learns from these samples how to classify documents into these domains  . '\]' his approach offers advantages in terms of development and maintenance  , but the quality of the results is not good enough in comparison with the semantic approach  . In either approach , document classification using words has problems as follows:  1  . Words in the documents must be normalized for matching those in the dictionary and the thesaurus  . Moreover , in the case of Japanese texts , it is difficult to extract words from them , because they are written without using blank spaces as delimiters and must be segmented into words  . 
2 . A simple word extraction technique generates to ( ) many words . In the statistical approach , the dimensions of tim training space are too big au  ( ltim classification process usually fails . 
Therefore , the . Jal ) anese document classification on words needs a high l  ) recision Japanese morphological analyzer and a great amount of lexical knowledge  . Considering these disadvantages , we propose a new method of document classification on kanfi character  , s , on which document classification is performed without a morphological analyzer and lexi-eel knowledge  . In our approach , we extracted o-main specific kanji characters for ' document classification by the X  2 metho ( I . The features of docu-lnents and domains are rel- ) resented using the tim_ture space the axes of which are these domain specific kanji characters  . Then , we classified Japanese documents into domains by mea ~ suring the similarity between ew documents and the domains in the feature space  . 
2 Document Classification on
Domain Specific Kanji Characters 2 . 1 Text Representation t ) yKanji

In previous researches , texts were represented by significarl two Ms , and a word was regarded as a min-immn semantic unit  . But a word is not a minimum semantic unit , because a word consists of one or more morphemes . Here , we propose the text representation by morpheme . We have applied this idea to the Japanese text representation  , where a kanji character is a morpheme . Each kanji character has its meaning , and Japanese words ( nouns , verbs , adjectives , and so on ) usually contain one or more kanji characters which represent the meaning of the words to some extent  . 
When representing the features of a text by kanji characters  , it is important o consider which kanji characters are significant for the text representation and useful for classification  . We assumed that these significant kanji characters appear more frequently of

I , ' rOlllllOWO li , these kanji characters are called the domain specific kanji chara clcrs  . 
Then , we represented the conteute ta Japanese text x as the following vector of douia in specific kanji characters : x =  ( fl , f2 .   .   .   .   . f / .   .   .   .   . /I ) ,   ( 1 ) where coinponent fi is the frequency of donia in SlW  . -ci Iickanjii and I is then uniber of all the extracted kanji characters by the X  2 lnethod . In this way , tilt ' Japanese text x is expressed as a point in the ~ l  .

1 . It is simpler to extract ka , iji characters than tO extract Japanese words . 
2 . There are about 2 , 000 kanji char ~ tcte , 's that are considered neccs sary h ) r general literacy . 
So , the rnaximuln number of dimensiol is of the training space is about  2  , 000 .

Therea soll why we use this encyclo-Imdia is thai  , it is lmblished in the electronic form and contain sagi ' oatlii ii ill  ) oi ' of articles .

Heibonsha " articles . So , it is difficult to extract appropriate domain specific kanji characters from the articles which are classified into the authors'specialties  . 
Therefore , it is important to consider that 206 specialties in the encyclopedia , which represent almost a half of the specialties , are used as the subjects of the domain in the Nippon Decimal Classification  ( NDC )  . For example , botany , which is one of the authors ' specialties , is also one of the subjects of the domain in the NDC  . In addition to this , the NDC has hierarchical domains . For keep iug the domains well balanced , we combined the specialties using the hierarchical relationship of the NDC  . The procedure for combining the specialties i as follows:  1  . We aligned the specialties to the domains in the NDC  .   206 specialties corresponded to the domains of the NDC automatically  , and the rest was aligned manually . 
2 . We combined 418 specialties to 59 code domains of the NDC , using its hierarchical relationship . ' Fable 1 shows an example of the hierarchical relationship of the NDC  . 
However , 59 domains are not well balanced . For example , " physics " , " electric engineering " , and " German literature " are the code domains of the NDC  , and we know these domains are not well balanced by intuition  . So , for keeping the domains well balanced , we combined 59 domains to 42 manually . 
3.2 Selection of Domain Specific Kanji
Characters by the X2 Method
Using the value X2 of the X2 test , we can detect the unevenly distributed kanji characters and extract these kanji characters as domain specific kanji characters  . Indeed , it was verified that X~method is useful for extracting keywords instead of kanji characters  ( Nagao ,  1976) . 
Suppose we denote the frequency of kanjii in the domain j  , mid , and we assume that kanji i is distributed evenly . Then the value X2 of kanjii , X  ~ , is expressed by the equations as follows:
Ij = ld_(*'d (4) rl zijj = lmid-k,x ~ . it ( s )   i=1 d : l where k is the number of varieties of the kanji characters and  1 is tile number of the domains . If the value X/2 is relatively big , we consider that the kanji i is distributed unevenly  . 
There are two considerations about the extraction of the domain specific kanji characters using the X  2 method . The first is the size of the training samples . If the size of each training sample is different , the ranking of domain specific kanji characters is not equal to tile ranking of tile value X  2  . ' File second is that we cannot recognize which domains are represented by the extracted kanji characters using only the value X : ~ of equation  ( 3 )  . In other words , there is no guarantee that we can extract the appropriate domain specific kanji characters from every domain  . From this , we have extracted the fixed number of domain specific kanji characters from every domain using the ranking of the value X~d of equation  ( 4 ) instead of ( 3 )  . Not only the value X ~ of equation ( 3 ) but the value X ~ d of equation ( 4 ) become big when the kanjii appears more frequently in the domain j than in the other  . Table 2 show stop 20 domain specific kanji characters of the 42 domains . Further , Appendix show stim meanings of each domain specific kanji character of " library science " domain  . 
3.3 Feature Space for the Docmnent
Classification
In order to measure the closeness between an unclassified document and the  42 domains , we proposed a feature space the axes of which are domain specific kanji characters extracted from the  42 domains . To represent the features of an unclassified document and the  42 domains , we used feature vec-to t's ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) respectively . To find out the closest domain , we measured an angle between the unclas-sifted document and the  42 domains in the feature space . If we are given a new document he feature vector of which is x  , the classification system can compute the angle 0 with each vector vi which represents the domain i and find vi with rain  0   ( vi , z ) . 

Using this procedure , every document is classified into the closest domain  .

SE\[JINGO"(about 2,000 articles ) 3 . editorial articles in Asahi Newspaper ( about 3 , 000 articles ) Because the articles in " Scientific American ( ill Japanese ) " are not cb~ssified , we classified them manually . The articles of " TENSEIJINGO " and tile editorial articles are classified by editors into a hi-of the NDC  . We aligned these domains to the 42 domains described in Section 3  . 1 . Some articles in thereof contain two or more themes  , and these articles are classified into two or more domains by editors  . For example , the editorial article'q boMany Katakana Words " is classified into three domains  . 
In these cases , we . j , dge that the result of the automatic classification is correct when it corresponds to one of the domains where the document is cbLs -sifted by editors  . Figure 3 , Figure 4 , and Figure 5 describe the variations of the classification results with respect o the number of domain specific kanji characters  . 
4.2 Evaluation
In our approach , the maximum correct recognition scores for the editorial articles and the articles in " Scientific American  ( in Japanese ) " are 74% and 85% , respectively . Considering that our system uses only the statistical information of kanji characters and deals with a great amount of documents which cover various specialties  , our approach achieved a good result in document classification  . From this , we believe that our approach is efficient for broadly classifying various subjects of the documents  , e . g . 
news stories . A method for classifying news stories is significant for distributing and retrieving articles in electronic newspaper  . 
The maximum recognition scores for " TENSEIJING O " is  47  % . The reasons why the result is far worse than the results of the other are :  1  . The style of the documents The style of " TENSEI , lINGO " is similar to that of an essay or a novel and it is written in colloquial Japanese  . In contrast , the style of the editorial articles and " Scientific American  ( in Japanese ) " is similar to that of a thesis . We think the reason why we achieved the good result in the classification of the editorial articles and " Scientific American  ( in Japanese ) " is that many technical terms are used in there and it is likely that the kanji characters which represent the technical terms are domain specific kanji characters in that domain  . 
2. Two or more themes in one document
Many articles of " TENSEIJINGO " contain two or more themes  . In these articles , it is usual that the introductory part has little relation to the main theme  . For example , the article " Splendid I Letirement " , whose main theme is the Speaker's resignation of the llouse of Representatives  , ha~s an introductory part about the retirement of famous sports men  . In conclusion , our apl Jroach is not effective in classifying these articles  . 
However , if we divide these articles into semantic objects  , e . g . chapter and section , these semantic objects may be classified in our approach  .

5 Conclusion
The quality of the experimental results showed that our apl  ) roachenables document classification with a good ac  . elracy , and suggested the possibility for Jat ) anese documents to t ) ere presented on the basis of kanji characters they contain  . 
6 Future Work
Because the training samples are created withov t this application in mind  , we may be able to improve the performance by increasing the size of the training samples or by using different samples which have the similar styles and contents to the documents  . We would also like to study the relation between tile quality of the classification result and the size of the documents  .
