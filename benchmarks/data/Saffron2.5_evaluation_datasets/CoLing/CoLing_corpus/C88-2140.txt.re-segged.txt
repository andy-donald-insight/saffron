As a consequence we developed a parser which is specifically designed to cope with the peculiarities of the German language  . 
Nevertheless , since our approach is based on sound linguistic principles  , most of the solu-tions found could be applied to other languages with a similar structure as well  . 
In this paper ' we will focus on the core of the system's parsing component and neglect other features like spelling correction  , treatment of anaphoricor elliptic utterances , quantif-ier seeping and the transformation into SQL  .

Our objectives were : to design a system which has good language capabi lities and which at the same time is easily portable  .

DB-DIALOG translates user-queries given in the fo ~m of written German sentences into structured SQL statements ? Since SQL is the de facto standard query language for relational database systems  , a wide range of database systems is accessible . The only adaptation to be done is a transform at ionuf the structured SQL output by DB-DIAI  . OG into the special SQL used by the spscific DBM So At the moment versions for ORACLE  , REFLEX and MIMER are imple-mented oin some other ways the interface is also designed to be as portable as possible ? Adap-tatlon-to new domains is facilitated by keep-inq the linguistic  , coverage separate from the actual domain knowledge which rests solely in the \]  . exlcon . Independence from the modeling of the domain in the database is achieved by distinguishing between a linguistically motivated descript ion of the domain and a database ~  , or lented one . Tllsre is an explicit " translation step between these two parts  . 
Language independence is not aimed at , because figure io For a description of the interface as a whole see Buch be rger et ai  . /1987/ . 
We have chosen to base our parser on semantic case frame instantiation  . Such an approach is well suited for a restricted domain parser  , because of its efficiency ( by avoiding useless parses in case of syntactic ambiguity  ) and its robustness in the case of ungrammatical ity  ( see eog . Grishmaneta \] . /1986/) . On the other hand , relying solely on that method , it would be difficult to capture syntactic generalities  ( Cog . active-passive transformation ) , because syntactic as well as semantic restrict ions must be specified explicitly for each slot of overy case frame  . This means that for every different syntactic realization of the same statement a different case frame has to be provided in the lexicon  . There are two severed rawbacks to this kind of realization : First  , general syntactic properties of the language are implicitly stated in the lexicon entries instead of explicitly in the grammar leading to a possibly inconsistent and patchy syntactic coverage ?' Second  , the lexicon is inflated because for a single word  ( meaning ) a number of different case frames is needed . 
To illustrate the problem let's have a look a % an example : ' liefer n '  ( = to deliver ) could have the following case frame : ( LIEFERN ( AOENT ( SYNTAX NP/NOM )   ( SEMANTICS COMPANY ) )  ( OBJECT ( SYNTAX NP/ACC )   ( SEMANTICS GOODS ) ) ) se\[lte ~ zo ? ~ . !:i,\]:((~JFJ:cmoWV'/,1 . i e f e : c t K u e h l s o h ~' a e n k t ~( X ~ Z Z C . ont~fi~ . t'f ) del:J . ? erswefEi ~ oratoy ' ~~) Bill ;  "\[ ; hO~::'~a:c6~vaciotl:3syl\]th , c  ~ , : ie Va:CJ . 6/ fJOnA3 of this state mei~t ; -passiv : kzatio ~ DJeKue hlsc:h : , : ' aeuke we ~: del ~ yondec " J .

In constituents ( with strict word order ) the CFM is invoked directly and tries to build up a caseffame  ( or more than one in case of ambiguity ) ? The result is returned to the ATN which makes use of it during further processing ? In structures with free constituent order  ( clauses ) the ATN acts solely as a collector The words are first processed mo ~ phologically and a chart is returned  , rendering a canonical form for each of the words together with word class and syntactic information  ( e?g . case markers ) . At this level , some ambiguities a ~ is e , eogo that of " welche " which might be an interrogative pronoun or a relative one  , and " die " which may be an article or e relat ive pronoun  .

Fig . 2: Morphological chart of constituents . Constituent case frames are merely stored in a local chart and attachment is postponed ? The only constituent recognized topologically is the head which always comes in the last position ? This chart of constituents Ks then given to the unification process when the POP arc is reached  . In addition to relying heavily on the CFM , the unificator also has various strategies at its disposal in order to take into consideration restrictions of adjacency and category dependent of the category of the phrase processed ? This way possible syntactic ambiguity is m ~duced and almost no backtracking is needed inside the ATNoGenerally  , information passed to the CFM is collected while traversing the subnet : head case frames are instantiated  , arguments and modifiers are collected by pushing the appropriate subnets and morphological and/or syntactic clues trigger various informations on the case frames ? 
AS an example we mention the passive ? transformation : if evidence for passive is gathered while analyzing the verbal complex  ( for S ) or a participle ( for APs )  , this information is passed onto the CFM . The CFM then applies the passive transform at ion to the relevant slots of the head case frame before the slot filling takes place  . These transformations are one way to take general syntactic information away from the lexicon  ( the case frames ) to reduce redundancy/Hayes et ai . 1985/ . 
6. An Annotated Example
To demonstrate how the system works , we will conclude the paper by giving an annotated example of a parse  . For the sake of clarity some of the details shall be simplified  , but all of the essentials will be properly described  . 
We have chosen the following example sentence : " Welchey on unseren Abteilungen in Wienbezieht fuer die Produktion benoetigteStoffevon Firmenaus dem Ausland ?"  ( " Which of our Viennese departments gets materia ls necessary for production purposes from a broad T "  ) Please note that the free translation does not capture the grammatical subtleties involved in the original sentence  ; especially the adjective phrase " fuer die Produktionber  . oet~gteSt offe " includes a passivizatlon that t is usually not expressed this way in 


There is a simple global control structure which works on this morphological chart ? Its main task is to transfer control to ATN networks for phrase -like constituents and % othe unlficator for clause-like constituents ? The control structure starts by transferring control to the PP/NP-ATNo The chart entry for " Ausland " is treated first  ( remember the right-to-left direction of processing  )  , i ~ is found to be a noun , and the next edge , DET , is processed . The third word , " aus ", finishes the PP/NP . Control is transfer z'ed to the case frame marcher ( CFM )  . The case frame for the head , " Ausland " , becomes instantiated , and the features of the other components are uni fied with it  , especially the feature of dative , which is derived from the determiner . 
After completion of this case frame , control is transferred back to the PP/NP net which processes " yonFirmen " in a similar way ? The CFM is called again  , constructing another case frame ~ According to our strategy  , PP attachment will not be performed at thls step  , instead all the constituents will be col lected first ? The PP/NPATN gets its next chance ? It treats the chart entry for " St of fe ~ which makes a perfectly suitable head for a more complex constituent  . We start to anticipate this when the next word , " benoetigte " ( " necessary " - albeit not an adjectives but a PPP in German  )  , is processed . In general , inflected PPPs trigger a PUSHAP , so does this one .   ( Uninflected PPPs form part of the verb complex )  . Next , a PUSH PP/NP is performed which will lead to a constituent embedded in the APeHutlet's see this in detail  . The PP is processed similar to % he others before  , the head " Produktion " becoming instantiated and the case frame filled after the entry for " fuer " has been processed  . 
This finishes the AP , since the verb , " bezieht " , definitely cannot be part of an AP . As you may remember , APst ~ Iggerth ~ unification component which in turn calls the CFM to handle the simpler tasks  . Thus , th ~ head of the AP , " benoetlgte " , becomes instant lated o The associated caee framelu presented below :  ( BENOETIG ( SYNSUBJ )   ( SEMORGANIZATION AL_UNIT )   ( SYNDOBJ )   ( SEMMATERIAL )   ( SYNPPOBJ ( FUER ) )  ( SEMPURPOSE ) ) Before the caseframe will be filled ~ a passive transformation is applied  , due to the fact that the example sentence contained the verb " benoetigen " in its PPPre  , me This transformation simply changes SUBJ to

Fig , 4: Case frame for PP/NP 3
Let us take a little digression ~ Suppose the PP/NP ~' fuer die Produktion " would not have fit into a slot of the PPP  . If we had taken " gefaerbte " ( " dyed " ) instead of " benoetigte "' this wo % ~ id do . In this case we would not get there e ~ ding " materials dyed for production puz ' poses " but instead two components  , dyed materials " and " for production pu ~ ' poses " o The sophisticated reader could argue that ' the first reading might also be correct  . The argument here is that theoase frames in our systems are constructed  . in a wa~t of it the

needs of the domain modelled ? In ou ~" domain , this reading would not be appropriate , so wed-_i . d not provide a case frame for it , thus excluding a theoretical ambiguity wherein the practical application the z " e is none ? As the slot filling fails  , the AP . .ATN will . 
backtrack . We get an AP consisting of just one single word  ( " gefaerbte " ) filling a slot in " Stoffe " , making up for one PP/NP and another PP/NP , namely " fuer die Produktion " . 
These two PP/NPs will be collected at this stage of processing and only attached when all of-the sentence will have been parsed  . 
We will stop our digression here a ** d come back to the original example ? Remember  , the AP has , lust been flnished and the PP/NP with the head " Stoff e " is POPped ? This means at rans fer of control to the CFM  ( in PP/NPs the CFM is called di~ectly , whereas in an APor Stile unlficator is ca lled first in o ~ der to : find correct at tachments ? Afterwards  , the unifl cat or in turn calls the CFM to realize ? the selected attachments  )  . The AI ? is integrated into the PP/NP case f rame as a modifier predicate in the MOD sloto The SUBJ slot of the subordinated case f rame  ( the one of " benoetigen " ) is still unfilled . For syntactic reasons , its filler must be the head of the superord inated PP/NP " Stoff e " o The semantic restric tion of the SUBJ slot is MATERIAL which is compatible with the noun " St offe "  , so the slot may be filled ( note that SUBJ is the transformed syntactic / ' estriction which had been DOBJ before the pass ive transformation had taken place  ) o Thus , a third constituent has been added to the pool of collected constituents ? The global control structure ce * rtinues by processing the next entry  , the representation of the word " bezieht " , which is a finite verb and has to beat the second position according to German grammar ? It is set aside for later processing and a special state is entered  , knowing that exactly one constituent has been left over ? The PP/NP " in Wien " is processed  , and a corresponding case f~ame is created . 
Similarly , a case frame for " welchey on unseren Abtei lungen " is created and " in Wien " is at tached to it when the unificator applies its knowledge that there cannot be more than one constituent in this position  . This way , possible ambiguities e . g ? trying to fill " in Wien " into a slot at sentence level  , are avoided ?

Two conditions have to hoid for them ~ adjacency and semantic cempatibility ~ PP/  NP4 e . go cannot be attached to an V other consti tuent  , because it is adjacent on : Ly to the main verb ? Therefore  , this constituent has to fill a slot in " beziehen " oFoi : the remain JngPP/NPs thOreex is t different possibllities oLe tus denote subordinat ~ on by the hyphen  characte:c0 From the adjacency point of view , the possibilities are : i ) P/NP 3 , PP/NP 2 , PP/NP1 ( three constituents at sentence level )  2 ) PP/NP3-PP/NP 2 , PP/NPI3) PP/NP3 , PP/NP 2 . ~ PP/NPI4 ) PP/NP 3- ( PP/NP2-PP/NPI ) 1 and 2 are excluded , because there is no slot in the " beziehen " case frame which matches the syntax of PP/NPI  ( preposition " aus " )  , nor would therebe semantic compatibility ?   3 is the reading wep ~ efer . 
As for '4 , its acceptability depends on whether weal low a slot in ~ he case frams for " St offe " which could hold an ORGANIZATION ALUNIT  . If we do , we will get an ambiguity . -- In that case , the system will offer both solutions , using a heuristic which of the solut ions to present first ? The heuristic imp lemented prefers flat syntactic structures ? AS for ' the preferred reading  , the CFM realizes it by filling PP/NP3 into the DOBJ slot and ( PP/NP2- . PP/NP1 ) into the PPOBJ slot of the case frame for " bezlehen " oPP/  NP4 has already been filled in the SUBJ slot , se the parse of the sentence has been completed ?   7  . Conclusion In this paper we have described a parser which is able to deal with a wide var iety of German sentences in an efficient and robust wry  . This is made possible by two special proper ties of the parser : First  , syntactic analysis uses two ' different strategies  , namely an ATN and unification " to deal wi th fixed word o~der at the eonsh :\[ tu ~  ; nt level and free corrstituent order at the c lause level rsspectively ? Such an app ' ~' oaeh i  . s well suited fox ' German , but also for other SOV languages like Dutch , Swedish , Danish and
Japanese ?
Second , the interaction between case fram ~ instant iation and a syntactic parser leads to the possibility of-clear and precise fo rmulation of syntactic and semantic rules and regularities  , reduction ' of entries in tlrelexicon , -flexibility and better malntal nabil ity ~ gene:c'al~o\]  , ~t:l , o ~' ~ s which may be a Dpllod\[:oothecian\[ ~ uagesms we ~\]  . lo
