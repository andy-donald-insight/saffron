Abstract : A formalism for ~ he representation of " semantic emphases " is introduced  , using principal and accessory instantiatiQns . It m~esit possible to convert predicate expressions in bonetwork-like structures  . As an application criteria for ooligatory and optional actants are dealt with  . 
I . The formal framework-A set X of objects , denoted by x , y , Zo-Aset E of events , states , actions ,   . . . , denoted by el , e2, . . . .
-A set L of places , denoted by 11, 12, . . . .
-A set T of intervals ( span ~ or moments ) on the time axis , denoted by tl , t2 ,   . . . .
- Ase ~ of functions f1'f2' . . o , which are mappings between the sets X , E , L and T . 
-Ase ~ of rela Uions in E , L and Tase.g.
eI~e2(eI is a partial event, . . . of e2J1 1~12 , tI~t2 , tI starts t2 , t I finishest 2et co(Allen (1984) ; Bier-winch (1988) for the general framework ) . 
-Finally a set of primitive semantic predl-cares BI  , B2 ,   . o . , ~ hat may have as arguments elements of X , L and T as well as propositions A , io e . predicates Bwluh their ( aopropriate ) arguments . 
While ~ he elements of the first four sets have the character of variables  , the functions , relations and predicates are fixed and interpreted in a characteristic way  . 
We use here the following functions : loc ( e ) = l : The location of e is 1 . 
~ ime(e ) = t : The time of e is to
If e is a path , one may define Init ( e ) = e ' and fln ( e ) = e " ( cf . Bierwisch 41988)) . One hastime ( in lt(e )) starts time ( e ) etc . 
We will use the following predicates :
ACT(x ) CAUSE(A1, A2)
HAVE(x , y ) CHANGE(A1 , A2) ( from AI ~ oA 2) NOT ( A ) a T ( AI , A2) ( oon junction )
BE Come(A)d ~ fCHANGE(NOT(A ), A)
On the basis of these formal components one has to give a definition of wellformed expressions  . One needs furthermore an axiom system expressing the fundamental properties of the predicates  . We skip this here ?2 . Instaatiations For each proposition A we assume an addi-tlonal argument place that is filled in by an element e of E o We say that " e is an Instan-tiation of A " or " e instantiates A " and write A~\]  ( Bierwisch ( 1988 )  , Reichenbach ( 19#8 ) )o We introduce here a distinction between two types of Instantiations  , namely-principal instantiations , representing a semantic emphasis , denoted by ep , -accessory instantlations , denoted by eao For each primitive predicate in a given inventory one Instantiatlon rule has to be formulated  . The rules are applied recurslvely and provide a means for " calculating " the Instantlations for complex propositions  . The results are network-like structures consist q ing of conditions only on the level of the sets X  , E , L and T . 
ACT(x ) Is\]e is an action of x.
HAVE(x , y)\[e\] , e is a state , that involves x's having ( owning ,   . . . ) of yo NOT(A)\[e\]$a condition , that implies ~ . & ~ e\] . 
It should be note ~ that for concrete A's concrete rules can be formulated  ( preserving presuppositions and certain arguments )  . 
In the next rules the index i = 1 , 2 indicates whether the first or the second argumen ~ yields the principal Instantlation  . For the index j = 1 , 2 we use ~ he convention " j ? i " o
CAUSEi(A1 , Aa)\[e\]:(e is a pair ( el , e2 ) ) ^  ( Al\[e  ~ )  ^  ( A2\[e2\] )  ^  ( eI causes e2 )  ^  ( ei = ep ) A ( ej = ea )  ^  ( tlme ( el ) = tlme ( e2 ) = time ( e ) ) ^  ( loc ( eI ) = loc ( e2 ) = lot ( e ) ) This is the rule for simultaneous causation
CH~NGEi(A1 , A2 ) \[ e\]: ( ~ is a path ) A ( in it ( e ) = el )  ^  ( f in ( e ) = e2 ) A ( ~21 ( AI , NOT(A ~))\ [ e ~^ ET '( Aj , NOT ( AI ) ) \[ ej \] ( el = ep ) A ( e ~= e a ) This preserves the semantic emphasis on Ai and allows a new index for the second ~\] T  . 
From this rule one obtains the conditions for B~O 1  ( A ) = CHANGE1 ( NOT ( A )  , A )   ( = CFASE ( NOT ( A )   )   ) B\]6 C2 ( A ) = CHANGE2 ( NOT ( A )  , A ) ( usual BEC(A)) . 
Note thai ; ETk(A , A )\ [ e\]eqA\[eJ for all k , A an de , BEC has one " degree of freedom " lesso
ETi ( A1 ~ A2 ) e: ( ei = e ) A ( j = ) ^  ( time ( el ) = time ( e2 ) = time ( e ) ) This way ) ~T becomes an unsymmetric predicate ? 3o Instanl ; iations and actants We illust : eate the notions defined above by a sample of German verbs with three necessary actants : the source x  , the goal z , end the ( transferred ) Object y . Under some simplifications we may assume the following expres-slon-scheme as basic pattern for this group :  (  1  ) O , ~s~fl/a(ACT(x/z) , 

In (1) 16 expressions are summarized , which one may obtain by choosing the upper index of CAUSE  , the argument of AOT , the upper Index of CH~GE and the upper index of the second occurrence of ~ in the CHANGEi-~le  . 
An occurrence of a predicate in an expression representing a certain sememe is called an inhere ~:  ,  . t occurrence , if this occurrence has to be instantiated for a suffic len~de-scriptlon of ~ hlsseme me  . The inherent occur ~ fences have to fulfil some condi ~ ionsl The inheren ~ occurrences ~ e closed under principal instantiations : If B  (  . .o,A, . .o ) is an i~herent occurrence of B , and the predicate Ayleids the principal insian -tia ~ ion of B  , then the uppermost predicate of A is an inherent occurrence ? The Inheren ~ occurrences are closed bottom-up : if : In B  ( ? . .,A , . . . ) the occurrence@f the upper . mos ~ predicate of A is inherent , the nth ~ occurrence of B is ~ m herent o in ( I ) it is sufficient to mark ( after the lri~stan~ia ~ :\[ e ~ ) both occurrences of ET as pri-ma~ely i~1~rent occurrences ( i . e . in it ( e ) a ~ dfl n(e ) are necessary ) . For co~cre~e some-mes one may add further inherent occurrences in accordance with the afore ~ said conditions  . 
The possibilities depend on the distribution of principal instantiation so Each element of X occurring in an expression a role can be assigned to s-ACT  (   ) defines in ( I ) the role " agent " . 
By spelling out the second argument of CAUSE in ( 1 ) without the details of Instant latlons we obtain four partial conditions : HAVE  ( x , y)\[inlt(e)\]ANOT(HAVE(z , y ))\ [ init(e)\]NOT(HAVE(x , y ))\[ fln(e)\]AHAVE(z , y ) \[ fin ( e ) \] Here e is the instantiation of CHANGE . 
-The occurrences of x in the first and the third partial expression define together the role " source " for Xo-The occurrences of z in the second and the fourth partial expression define together the role " goal " for Zo-The occurrences of y in the first and the fourth partial expression define together the role " object " for y  . 
In this sense we may speak of role defining occurrences  . They are independent of the distribution of the hypes of insbantiations  . 
Now we are able to formulate the following principle :  ( 2 ) An actant is obligatory in a certain role iff all its defining occurrences for this role are direct arguments in inherent occurrences of predicates  . 
In order to avoid mixing up surface and deep phenomena one should note thaS the arguments of ACT in  ( 1 ) for the verbs considered under A . ~ H . are subjects ( in active voice ) and hence " obligatory " . This assigmnent predominates over ( 2 ) in passive voice , too : In C . the aciantze . g . is according to ( 2 ) ob-ligatory as goal and agent , but being the subject in active voice , not obligatory in passive voice . The same applies for the subjects in passive voice  . 
In ( 3 ) we list the first eight possibilities of ( 1 ) with the following abbreviations in the corresponding columns :  1  . upper index of CAUSE 2o argument 9 fACT 3 . upper index of CHANGE and the first ET 4 . upper index of the second ET 5 . distribution of source , object and goal according to ( 2 )   ( optional : in brackets ) predicate CHANGE express an emphasis on
BEC(NOT(HAVE(x , y ))): from
BEC(HAVE(z , y )) ~ to one argument of CHANGE : from to 7 . distribution of the actants taking into account the agent in active voice  ( 3 )  1 .  2 .  3 .  ~ .  5 . G .  7 . 
A . I zI~(x ) y(z ) from to ( x ) y z
B . IzI1 x(y(k )) from x(y)zc . 1 z22 (( x)y ) zto((x)y)z
D . I z2I(x ) y(z ) from to(x)y z
E . IxI2(x ) y(z ) from to x y(z)
F . IxIIx(y(z )) from x(y(z ))
G .1 x22 (( x)y ) zto x(y)z
H . Ix2I(x ) y(z ) from to xy(z)
These eight possibilities refer to the following German verbs  ( among many others ) : A . wegnehmen , abnehmen ( take aw~/of_~f ) , entwenden ( ~ , filch )   ( ~ ) Die Omanasa ( demBa by ) die Schere weg . 
(5 ) Erhat ( deralien Frau ) de~sch were nK of-ferabge nommen . ( so she needn't carry it )
B . be steblen ( ro_~b , steal from )   ( 6 ) Erhat die Frau ( um1 OOO Mark ) be stohlen . 
C . stehlen ( steal )   ( 7 ) Erhat ( ( der Frau ) 1000 ~ ark ) gestohlen . 
D . annehmen (  ~ ~  ( borrow )   ( 8 ) Rrhat ( yonder Frau ) 1000 Markgeborgt . 
( so he has some money now )
E . verschenken ( giveaw ~) ,  ~  , ausgebeq(giveou__~t ,  ~ )  , ausliefer n(delive__~r ) , verleihen ( lend ( out ) )  ( 9 ) Gebejunge Katzenab ! ( somebody wants to get rid of the kittens )   ( 10 ) Hamsha ~ das Spielzeug ( and ie Kinder ) verschenkt . ( so he has no to ys any more )
Foliefern ( de live_~r )   ( 11 ) Die Firmal iefer t ~ uns ) das Papier )  . 
G . beschenken(rp_~nts . o . ) , bellefer n ( furn is ____~ h ,  ~  )   ( 12 ) Hanshat die Kinder ( mit Spielzeug ) be-schenkt .   ( so taey have some to ys now )   ( 13 ) Die Firmabelle fertuns ( mitPapier )  . 
H . schenken ( make A present of s . th . ~ os . o _ . __~ . ) , lelhen(lend , not borrow )   ( I @ ) Hansschenkte ( den Kindern ) Spielzeug . 
There is some support for 6 . in ( 3 ) by - the result at lve aspect ( a clear difference between A . and D . and between E . and H . , on the other hand a great similarity between
A . and E . and between D . and H . ) , -the prefixes , forming three types (" from " , " over " and " to " except be- , vet- , o . o ) . 
In German exists a rich system of preft xu derivatives in this group  , their detailed examination confirmes the distinctions proposed here  . Verbs like Gbernehme ~ ( tak ~ over ) or ~ bcrgeben , Gberreichen ( banove ___ ~ r ) belong to both from-to-cases A . and
D . or E . and H ., respectively ?
The remaining eight cases ( upper index of CAUSE is 2 ) represent the passive voice of
A.-H.a~d some other verbs , e.g.
H ~ be kommen , erhalten ( receiv_~e )   ( 15 ) Die Kinderbekamen ( yon Hans ) Spielzeug 0 The distribution ( x ) y ( z )   ( under 5 . ) turns into ( x)yz ( under (7 . ) . For these verbs the passive voice is impossible ? Just the basic verbs nehmen and eb ~  ( and some more , e . g . fiberge ben ) do not meet the scheme in every detail : They may occupy sev ~ eral positions of show a different distribution or option alao ~ ants  . It goes without s~ylng that for many of the considered verbs the expression  ( I ) has to be specified , i . e o HAVE is too general . Moreover stealln ~ is against the law , present lng is connected with some benefit of z etc  .   .   .   . 
The classification of this verb group is in keeping with Schumacher  ( 1986 )  , p . 72 d froOther groups of verbs ( e . g . " Informing " ~ mitteile ~, oo . , erfahren ) have been dealt with the same way . Pairs of the type ~ of ill the bottle with wate ~ r and to fill water i ~ o the bottle Field another confirmation of this formal approach  .
