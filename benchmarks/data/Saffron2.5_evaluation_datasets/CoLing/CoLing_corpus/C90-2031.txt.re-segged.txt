Abstract
Usnal plan-based approaches to speech act interpreta-tiottrequire that perib~zning a speech act implies its suc-ces:s  . These approaches are thus useless for describing failing ille cut ~ on ary or per locutionary acts  . We propose ant ~ lternatiw ~ plan-based view of speech acts centered around the notion of trying to do-as opposed to actually doing-an action  . This approach is contrasted with that of I ' errault which aims to overcome similar problems  . 
1.: ~ ntroduction
The . , plan-based approach to the analysis of natural an-gu~bge dialogues  , inspired by the work of Austin\[Austin 62\] and Searle\[Searle 75\] \[ Searle/Vanderveken 85\]  , has dominated most of the dialogue-oriented NLU research since the lates eventies  , cf . \[ Allen 79\] , \[Allen84\] , \[Cohen78\] , \ [ Cohenf Perrault 791\] , \ [ Perrault/Allen80\] , \[Litman85\]~\[Pollack86\] . It is characterized by the following assumptions : o Utterances are actions planned and executed by the speaker to satisfy some of her goals  . 
? Speech acts can be represented as operators in planning systems such as STRIPS\[Fikes /Nilsson  71\] which relate actions to their preconditions and effects  . 
$ The speaker's beliefs and intentions can be inferred by observing her utterances  . 
Sew ~ ral variants of describing actions in planning systems have been proposed in the lkerature  . We will use the tbllowing c , onventions : an action is defined by a quin-tuple comprising ? an action description  , e . g . ( pick up ? x ) in the blocks world domain , o a set of preconditions , e . g . ( on-table ? x) , ? the add-llst , a set of propositions which become true once the action has been performed  , e . g . ( holding ? x) , ? the delete-list , a set of propositions which are no longer true after the action has been pertbrmed  , e . g . 
( on-table ? x) , ? the body , a list of lower-level actions comprising the described action  , e . g . the movements of a robot arm : in the blocks world domain  . 
1Thi :~ paper was written by the first author but describes work jointly undertaken with the second  . 
The relationship between these elements is interpreted as conditional generation  ( following \[ Goldman 70\] , \[ Pollack 86\] ) : the execution of the body actions generates the defined action  ( and thus its effects as described in the add- and delete-list  ) iff the preconditions hold . 
All three acts involved in making an utterance , the lo-cutionary , illocutionary , and per locutionary acts , may fail : the addressee may no the arthe utterance  , she may not understand the speaker , or she may not react according to the speaker's intentions  . 
But when actions are defined in terms of their effects  , a failure to achieve the effects implies a corresponding failure to perl brm the action  . When Itry to drive a nail into the wall with a hammer  , and fail , then I have not driven an ail into the wall . Similarly , when I utter a declarative sentence , and fail to convince the hearer , I have failed to perform the intended per locutionary act  . 
When the addressee does not understand me , 1 have not even performed an illocution ary act , and so on . Regardless of the level of description there's always the chance that the action may fail  , i . e . that there was no action . 
Even granted that we could capture practically all of the relevant cases by describing the action on the level of  , say , producing sounds , there's no way to relate that level of description to the intentions of the speaker  . 
This is a rather unfortunater sult , as we take the observed action as the starting point for inferring the speakers beliefs and intentions -- which may well be the same  , regardless of the speech act's success . Clearly , an approach facilitating a uniform treatment of succeeding and failing speech acts would be most welcome  . 
There are two ways to cope with failing speech acts  . 
The first amounts to weakening the inference from the performance of an action to its effects being achieved  , i . e . 
making it defeasible . The other solution is to describe actions in terms not presupposing their successful execution  . The former approach was proposed by Perrault\[ Perrault  87\] and furtherefined by Appelt and Konolige\[ Appelt/Konolige  88\]  , while the latter is the one we use . 
2. Perrault's approach
Perrault describes the way assertions influence peoples beliefs by distinguishing between axioms describing strong evidence for beliefs  , and default rules capturing the effects of ( sometimes failing ) speech acts . The most important axioms are : Persistence : l- B x  , t + lBx , tP : 3Bx , t + lPObseroability : ~ DOx , ta & DO y , tObs(x)D

Agents remember their previous beliefs ( memory ) , they stick to what they believe they believed previously  ( persistence )  . If an agent observes another agent , she knows of all actions the observed agent performs  ( ob-servability )  . Memory and persistence together imply that agents never forget and never change their beliefs  . Observing is regarded as the only dependable mode of acquiring new knowledge  . 
Speech acts are considered to be a weaker kind of evidence  , and thus the effect of uttering a declarative sentence is modelled by default rules : 
Declarative rule : DOx , t(p .) ~ Bx , tp
Belief transfer : Bx , tBy , tp ~13x , tpi . e . , an agent believes what she thinks other agents believe  , provided this is consistent with her previous beliefs  ( belief transferule )  . Uttering a declarative sentence implies by defaul that the speaker believes its propositional content  ( declarative rule )  . 
For the most part , this theory makes correct predictions . For example : ? The hearer will not be convinced by an assertion if it contradicts one of her previous beliefs  . 
? Aliar will not be convinced by her own lie , but may still believe that she successfully deceived the un-suspecting hearer  . 
In both of these cases do the axioms ( memory and persistence ) override the defaults . 
However , adopting Perrault'solution has the unfortunate side effect of depriving speech act rules of their definitional import : an action may be executed without its effects being achieved  . What are the effects anyway ? According to Perrault  , uttering a declarative sentence implies ( by default ) that the speaker believes its propositional content ~ this can hardly be thought of as an effect of the speech act  , and it isn't a precondition , either . 
As neither the effects of an assertion or its constituting body actions are specified  , this leaves assertions as a pri-mitive , ' undefined notion . But what is a theory of assertions worth if it does not say what an assertion is or what would count as " making an assertion "?  . 
There's also another , more technical problem : when a speaker has no belief whatsoever about P  , she can convince herself that P is true by simply uttering " P  . ': as it's perfectly consistent for her to believe P  , both of the declarative rule and the belief transferule are applicable and will lead to her believing P  . Thus , a speaker may convince herself of anythings he is incompetent of  . 
As Appelt and Konolige have shown , this deficiency can be overcome by employing a more sophisticated nonmonotonic theory  , cf . \[Appelt / Konolige 88\] . But is this added complexity really necessary ? Even though Appelt and Konolige claim  ( without proof ) that there can be no specification of the effects of an assertion that applies under all possible circumstances  , we aim to achieve just that . Instead of assuming that speech acts sometimes fail to achieve their normal effects  , we admit that in fact no ( successful ) speech act was performed in these cases and relate the speakers behaviour to the intended act by some other means  , namely by making explicit the notion of " tlTing ' . 
3. Trying to do things with words
The missing link between an agent's intentions and her  ( sometimes unsuccessful ) performance of the intended action is the notion of " trying ~: when an agent has a present directed intention to A  ( cf . \[Bratman87\]) , she will try to do A , and -- if the preconditions for doing A ares at is fied-she will thereby do A  . Fig . 1 illustrates this : ( Sintends A ) leads to in
Fig . 2: From intention to action
The try-to-do level of description provides an ideal basis for analyzing the agent's intentions  , as such an analysis is independent of the action's uccess  . 
The interpretation process uses a default rule to determine whether an action was executed successfully : From try-to-do to do : If it is known that an agent Stries-to-do A in the situation  SITA2   , then assume ( by default ) that S does A in SIT'A . 
The consequence of this conclusion is modelled by another  ( nondefault ) rule : From action to effect : If an agent S does A in the situation SITA  , then the preconditions of A are satisfied in a situation SITp temporally including SITA  ( because otherwise it would have been impossible to do A  )  , and the effects of A are satisfied in a situation SITE temporally met by 

If this conclusion contradicts a previous belief , the default assumption that Shad successfully done A is defeated  . 
He relies one of the main differences between Perrault's approach and our's : where he uses defaults for the inference from the performance of an action to its effects  , we use defaults for the inference from try-to-do to do  . r Fhe results are similar , but this move allows us to 2perrault associates belief ~ and other propositional ttitudes with time points  , whereas we use situations as partial descriptions of the world over a time interval  . For the purpose of this paper we deliber at lyslur over this distinction as it is unimportant for the issue at hand  . 
180 use strict definitions of speech acts . For example , the , ! ~ peechact assertion is defined as follows:
Aetion ~ AssertP ( in SITu )
Pre~ondition m The hearer believes that the speaker is sincere and competent in SITU  . 
Add-list : The hearer believes that the speaker believes P  . 
Body : Utter ~ P . "  ( in SITv ) ':\[~ e effect ( as specified in the add-list ) is what we take to be the fllocutionary point : to achieve that the hearer believes that the speaker believes the propositional con-~nt  . 
Let us assume the following scenario : a speaker S  ut-4~ers " P . "  ( referring to a situation SITR ) in the situation SIT v . Sincerity and competence of the speaker can be judged by an observer O  ( who may be identical to the ~! ~ peaker ) using the following rules : In sincerity of a speaker in uttering an asser-tion : If it is known to O that for some situation SIT  1 temporally included in SITR , S believes P to be false in SIT1 , then Oknows that S is in sincere in SITu . 
Incompetence of a speaker in uttering an assertion : If it is known to O that for some situation SIT  2 temporally including SITR , S has no belief regarding the truth of P in SIT2 , then Oknows that S is incompetent in SITu , To complete the picture , we use a belief transferule quite similar to the one Perrault uses  , except that it ~ flocks inferences of the form
B x B y B x p ~ B x B x p - ~ B x P which we think are unreasonable : an agent does not ~ dop the beliefs she thinks other people have of her-- at least not automatically  . Fig .   2 illustrates the overall : ~ tructure of the interpretation process  , which is the ~ mme for the speaker , the hearer , or any incidental overhearer :
H :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: : ~:-::: i:::  : :   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   . : : : ! : : i i i : ! : : , ! i : i ~ Illocution .   .   .   .   .   .   .  :!!:: , :+:+:  .  : , : : . : :  .  :  .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .  ,  .   .   .   .   .  , ,  .  ,  .   .   .   .   .   .   .  :  .  : , :+: : . :, .  : . : . 
Fig . 2: Interpreting an assertion
The thick grayline encloses the aspects of the interpre - ~  ; ation process described in this paper . 
An example : the speaker S and the hearer H originally beth believe that-P  . There are no other relevant beliefs . When Sutters " P . ' , ? S recognizes herself to be in sincere and thus her assertion -- as an utterance to her self- fails  . On the other hand , it is consistent for S to believe that H will take her to be competent and sincere by default  , and that as an utterance to H the assertion will succeed  , i . e . BsBHB sp and thus BsBtlp . 
? H believes S to be competent and sincere by default and therefore the illocutionary act succeeds as an utterance to H  . H believes that S believes P ( BnB sp) , but sticks to her previous belief that-P . 
As a result , beth S and H will continue to believe-~P , but will also ( wrongly ) attribute to the other a belief that P . 
If instead the speaker had no belief about P initially  , she would judge herself in competent and again would not trusther own words  . 
Determining the speaker's intentions is considerably more complex  , as it require search in a web of action descriptions linked by  ( conditionally - ) generates and gener . 
ated-by relations . In general , the observed action Ao and the intended action A x are linked by a path 
Ao generated-by generates A1
The separation of the analysis of belief and intentions enables a straightforward interpretation of a speech act's effects while offering a sound basis for the subsequent analysis of the speaker's and hearer's intentions  . 
4. Intending to try
We have described trying-to . do A as an intermediate step between intending to A and doing A  . An agent may describe heractions as " doing A " or " trying to do A '  , and the latter will often just reflect her doubts as to whether she will succeed  . Nevertheless , if A is an action , then so is tryA , and intending to try A is a genuine intention distinct from an intention to A  . 
In both cases will the intending agentry-to-do A , and sometimes do A , but even if she fails to do A , she cannot fail to try A . Trying A will sometimes have the effects of A-ing -- and  , if it does , will have caused these effects -- but its only necessary result is that A has been tried  . 
Therefore , trying A can be successful where A-ing is not . 
For example , I may intend to try to move a heavy log(cf . 
\[Bratman 87:38f\] ) while strongly believing I will fail--just to demonstrate hat I cannot move it  . This demonstration is successful only if I do not succeed in moving the log despite trying real hard to do so  . 
Bratman ( cf . \[Bratman 87: 111ff\] ) did not recognize the difference between trying . to-do A as a consequence of intending to A and trying-to-do A as a consequence of in-tending to tryA  . Histermendeavoring ( adopted from \[ Chisholm 76\] ) encompasses both cases . This missing distinction seems to be responsible for most of the lesselegant aspects of Bratman's theory  , especially the way he relates acting with an intention to acting intentionally  . On the " Simple View " , mlagents doing A intentionally implies her intention to A  . Bratman dismisses this Simple View on the grounds that an agent will sometimes act intentionally without  ( in a strong sense ) in-tending the action . 

Consider the following example taken from \[ Bratman  87:137\]: Bratman very much wants to mar ~ TSus an , and he equally much wants to marry Jane . He know she cannot marry both but is unable to resolve the conflict  . 
Therefore he hopes that Susan and Jane will settle the issue for him : he tries to persua de both women to marry him  , expecting that just one of the two will agree . This kind of behaviour seems perfectly rational ~ though probably immoral--but according to Bratman'strong consistency requirement for intention she should not intend to persua de Susan and Jane to marry him when he know shecem not marry both  ( and thus cannot achieve both per locutionary acts )  . Bratman concludes that he intentionally persuades Susanaswellas Jane  , without endorsing the inconsistent intention to persuade both  . 
Instead he proposes " guiding desires ~ as a weaker kind of intentions guiding an agents conduct  . 
We can offer a simpler solution : while sticking to the Simple View  , we agree that it is irrational for Bratman to intend to persuade two women to marry him  . It is not ( necessarily ) irrational , however , to intend to try to persuade both women , believing that at most one of the two will agree , and such an intention will lead to the same behaviour towards Susan and Jane as an intention to persuade them simpliciter would  . The distinction between stronger and weaker kinds of intentions is therefore unnecessary  . 
Returning to the issue of speech act interpretation  , consider the following case : Mary is tried for a crimes he did not commit  . She has all the evidence against her , though , and thus she is convinced no one will believe her if shep leads " Notguilty "  , or even trusther she believes it herself . Unfortunately , Mary cannot rationally intend to asserts he is innocent when she is certain of her failure  , so what could she do ? Again , the intention to try comes to the rescue : poor Mary may rationally intend to try to assert she is innocent  ( as she has every reason to do so )  , and this intention will lead to her uttering " Not guilty ~  . 
5. What has been achieved ?
We have developed a descriptive framework to provide a uniform account of successful as well as unsuccessful speech acts  . The notion of trying-to . do an action is applicable in both cases and can serve as the basis for analyzing the ~  , peaker's intentions . Our theory makes all the correct predictions that Perrault's theory makes  , but it does additionally handle the cases which are problematic for Perrault's account  . 
MEDIAS , a module for speech act interpretation along the lines of the approach presented here has been implemented using the expert systems hell HARES as a rapid prototyping tool\[Genzmann  89\]  . MEDIAS handles assertions as well as yes/no questions  , distinguishing in-formation-seeking from information-probing questions  . 
We are currently investigating the role of natural an-guage utterances in initiating  , planning , and coordinating cooperative behaviour ( cf . \ [ Werner89\]) . This research will build upon and extend the first prototype of the MEDI~LS system  .
