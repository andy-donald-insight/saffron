1 Introduction
Current linguistic theories place an increasing amount of grammatical information in the lexicon and employ a variety of mechanisms to express generalizations across lexical entries : templates  ( Flickinger 1987 , Shieber 1986) , inheritance hierarchies ( Flickinger 1987 , Pollard and Sag 11994) , and lexical rules ( Bresnan 1982 , I ) owty 1982 , Gaz-dar et al . 1985, Pollard and Sag 1994) . Lexical rules ( hence ibrth : LRs ) have been subjected to particularly closes < : rutiny  . ' Fhis research hastb-cused on two important issues :  1  . how the use of LRs affects the generative power of grammar formalisms and the computational complexity of parsing algorithms  ( Uszkoreit and Peters 1986 , Carpenter 1991) , and 2 . how to provide a de-notational semantics for LRs ( Calcagno and PoPlard 1995 , Meurers 1995) . In this paper we address neither of these two issues  . Instead we will concentrate on a question that we c < m sider to be of equal importance  , but that has received surprisingly little attention : Under what conditions should an I  , R be applicable to a given lexical entry ( henceforth : LE ) ? For gramrnar formalisms that employ the notion of unitication of attribute-value structures  , two criteria for applicability naturally suggest hemselves :  1  . llypolhcs is A : A lexical rule applies to a lexical entry if r the lexi <: al entry unifies with the left hand side of t  ; he lexical rule . 
2 . Hypothesis B : A lexical rule applies to a lexical entry iff the lexical entry is subsumed by the left hand side of the lexical rule  ) Without much argument , it is cotnmonly as-sume < that llypothesis A is correct  ( el . Pollard and Sag 1994 , (\] alcagno and Pollar < t : 1995 , and Meurers 1995) . This paper argues that 11ypoth-esis A should be rejected on empirical grounds . 
We discuss a number of Lls that have been used in IIPSG analyses of German  ( tlinri<:hs and Nakazawa 1994 ) and show that the grammar will either vastly overgenerate and accept ungrammatical sentences or introduce spuriou structural ambiguity for grammatical sentences  , if l typothesis A is adopted . I to we ver , no such problems of overgeu-eration or spurious ambiguity arise  , if one adopts l lypothesis B , instead . 
It would go beyond tim scope of this paper to present a flJly worked-out proposal on how to i > ro-cess LRs in a coml  ) utational system for IIPSG . 
I to we ver , as discussed in section 6 , it is worth noting that the subsumption test for I  , lapplication <' . an be integrated straightforwardly into two recent proposals by van Noord and Bouma  ( :1994 ) and by Meurers and Minnen ( 1995 ) of how to implement labina processing system for HPSG  . 
l'Fhis paper will not provide a formal definition of subsumption or nnificiation for typed feature structures  . Instead , we refer the reader to the standard definitions of Kasper and Rounds  ( 1986 ) and Carpen-tel: ( 1992 )  , among many <) tilers . Informally speaking , two feature structures are unifiable itf they do not con-tabincompatible information  . One feature structure subsumes another iff the intormation contained in the former is less specific than in the latter  .

German exhibits two types of passNes : personal passives  , as in ( lb ) , and impersonal passives , as in (2b , 3b) .

' The dead were commemorated.'
For personal passives the accusative object NP of a transitive verb  , e . g . den Mannin ( la ) , in its active form corresponds to an NP with nominative case  , e . g . der Mannin (11)) . In impersonal passives a datiw ; or genitive NP complement of a transitive verb , e . g . the dative NP demMan n in (2) , exhibits the same case assignment in the active and passive forms  . ' IS form Mly capture the relationship between the l  , Es for active and passive forms of German verbs in IlPSG  , Kiss (1992) formulates the LRs in Fig .  1  ( henceforth referred to as the PPL t and the IPLR , respectively ) , u The LRs in b'ig . I employ the HPSG feature geometry of Pollard and Sag  ( 1994 )  . a'\]' hespec-ill cation of a syntactic category ( CNI ' ) in tlPSO > However , see Kathol ( 1994 ) and Pollard ( 1994 ) for an account of German passive without LRs . 
a In order to reduce the size of the feature structures  , prefixes of paths that begin with the SYNSEM attribute have been omitted as much as possible in Fig  .   1 and all other feature structures that are shown in this paper  . 
According to Kiss , specifying two different case wtl-ues under one reentrancy  ( cf . tags\[~in the PPLR ) is a shorthand notation for identity of the two categories in all respects  , except for the case value . '\]' heoriginal includes the feature VALENCE ( abbreviated as VAL in lqg .  1) , which in turn specifies for verbs under the features SUILI and COMPS the subject and nonsubject complements  . COMPS takes a list of categories , (: ailed synsem objects , as its vahn ; . If the list is nomempty , the h : ftmost category in the list represents the direct object  . The intended effect of the PPI , I is to promote the direct object of a . transitive verb in the l , l , \] for the actiw ~' form to the subject of the passive form  . l , ' ol : impersonal passives the COMPS list of any transitive verb whose leftmost complement is marked by genitive or dative case remains unchanged  , while the singleton list of the subject value of the active form becomes the empty list in the I  , E for the passive form . Note that the case specifications on the lefthand side of the rules m : e crucial since they condition which classes of transitive verbs appear in personal and impersonal passives  . 
Viewed procedurally , the PPI , I , is meant to a p--ply to \[ , Es for transitiw ; verbs such as kau , \[ en as shown in +' ig .  2 .   4 For transitive verbs it makes no ditthrence whether we use unitication or subsumption as the test of  ;  , pplicability t br the PP l , lC'\['he LE for any transitive verb is more specific than the features tru <- ture of the input description of the PPI  , I , since the PHON wdue and the COMPS and SO l + ; 1 wJues will be further instan-dated than in the input description of the PPM ~  . 
In particular , the COMPS list of the PPLR is entirely schematic R  ) rany nonempty list of categories whose tlrst element is an accusative NP  , while the COMPS vahle for kaufi ' . n is a list with exactly one element that has the same category and cases pc'cification as the NP in the PIq  , R . 
Therefore ,   ; he LE will both unify with and be subsumed by the input Datn restructure of the IJPLI  . However , as we will see in the next section , the choice of subsumption or unification makes a crucial dil Drence when \[  , Es are themselves highly schematic and underspecitled  . 
t brmulation of the I , Rs by Kiss ( 1992 ) differs from the version presented herein minor definition M details  . 
t to wever , these differences are entirely orthogonal to the theoretical issues discussed in this paper  .

I lowever , this derived LE would have the undesirable consequence that it admits ill-formed sentences such as  ( 6 )  .

In ( 6 ) the auxiliary k6nnen has been passivized and the direct object of the transitive verb has been promoted as the subject of  k6nnen   . low-ever , since in German only main verbs can be passivized  , the sentence is ungrammatical . 7 Ungrammatical sentence such as ( 6 ) can be success fiflly ruled out if the PPLR , is applied to an I , E only if the input specification of the LR subsumes the LE  ( Hypothesis B )  . The subsumption requirement for LR application is based on the insight that LRs should apply only to LEs that are instantiated at least to the extent that the input description of the LR minimally requires  . In the case at hand , the list of raised arguments in the LE for kdnnen in Fig  .   3 is totally unspecified-it can be any list of nonverbal synsem objects  , in-chiding the empty list . The COMPS list of the lefthand side of the PPLR , on the other hand requires the leftmost element ocarry accusative > rhere are some cases of " long distance " passives  , i . e . passives which involve the complelnent of an embedded verb  , that at least some German speakers accept , e . g .

case . Therefore the COMPS list of kSnnen does not subsume the COMPS list on the lefthand side of the PPLR  , or vice versa . Accordingly , no subsutnption relationship exists between the input specification of the PPM as a whole and the LE for kb'nnen  , tIence if tIypothesis B is assumed , the Lt can be success fiflly blocked , s However , even under subsumption nothing blocks the PPLR from applying to the transitive verb kaufen  , as discussed in section 2 . Therefore the grammatical sentence in ( 7 ) can be derived successfully .

' The car was bought . '  5 Avoiding Spurious Ambiguity This section will consider the interaction of highly schematic LEs with another LR commonly used in IIPSG : the Complement Extraction LR  , formulated for English by Pollard and Sag (1994) . Fig .   5 shows the version of the Complement Extraction LexicM Rule for German  ( henceforth : CELRG ) that has been proposed by Hinrichs and Nakazawa ( 1994 )  .

The CELRG moves an element from the
COMPS list of a verb to its SI , ASH set . The value of the feature SLASH contains those items that are realized in left dislocated position  , e . g . as a topicalized constituent in sentence qnitiM position  . Analogous to the applicability of tile PPLR , the CELtG is applicable to LEs of transitive verbs such as kauf cn shown in Fig  . 2, under both unification and subsumption . \[ File result of such an application is the same as shown in Fig  .  2 , except that the direct object is placed on the SLASH set instead of the  SUB3 list . For the analysis of sen-8The reader may wonder whether one couldn't get around the requirement that the LR for passive apply undersubsmnption by restricting the rule to apply only to main verbs  . At first glance this seems like a possible way -out  , since the cases that we havc considered problematic for applying the LR under unification involve LEs of auxiliaries  . I Iowever , the ( : lass of argument raising verbs is not restricted to auxiliaries  . Verbs such as verstehen (' know how') , as in ErverstehtParser zu implementier cn ( ' He knows how to imple Inent parsers . '), fall into the same class . But verstehen is a main verb , not an auxiliary . Thus , even if the LR would be reformulated to apply ' only to auxiliaries  , the following ungrammatic M sentence could not be excluded : * Parser wer denverstanden zu implementieren  .

As in the ease of the PPLR , the difference between Hypotheses A and B comes into play when we consider the interaction of the  ( 2 1!'LtLG with highly schematic entries such as the ones Ilin-richs and Nakazawa  ( 1994 ) assume for att xiliaries in German . If Hypothesis A is assumed , then the CEI , IG will be applicable to the type of I , E shown for kSnnen in Fig .  3 , since such an I , l '\] will unify with the input descrit ) tion of the LI ,  . One of the possible outputs of the I3 to such an auxiliary entry wouht look identical to l  ; heputative , output of the PPL It shown in Fig .  4 , expect that one of the elements from the COMPS list of the auxiliary is assigned to the SLASH set instead of the SUBJ list  ;  . However , this would have the undesirable consequence that the SLASII wdnein  9The tree in Fig .   6 ~ Lssum cs the tlat constituent structure for Germ ~tncbuts estructure proposed by tI in richs and Nakazttwa  ( 1994 )  . However , the issueraised with respc'c to the CEI , RG in this p~t per is orthogonal to overall assumptions of German obtuse structure  .

the analysis of topicalized sentences that contain auxiliaries could originate in the LE for the main verb  , but also in the LE for each auxiliary present in the sentence  . Hence , in addition to the . tree in Fig .  6 , three addition M trees are admitted for sentence ( 81 ) in which the SLASII value originates in one of the preterminal nodes for the anxiliaries  . 
These nodes are marked l bremp has is by an asterisk in Fig  .  6 . This ambiguity is , of course , totally spurious since it does not correlate with a difference in semantics or any other relevant linguistic property of the sentence  . I !' roma computational perspective , such spurious ambiguities are highly undesirable since they force the parser into considering multiple analyses where a single analysis sufl bes  . The spurious ambiguity that we have just identified is particularly pernicious  , since it ; would ai D . el a wide range of sentences in any grammar of German that employs argument composition and the  ( JEI~IG : all assertion main clauses that con-tMn auxiliaries would be affected since in assertion clauses the initiM constituent is the result of topicalization  . 
Once again undesirable consequences of over -applying an Litunder unification can be avoided if applicability of LRs instead requires subsumption  ( llypothesis B )  . Since the CEMG limits extracted constituents to phr~ses and since the COMPS list  ; of an auxiliary does not restrict , its elements in the same w~ty , the LI , \] for auxiliaries ~ md the input description of the CEI  , IG do not stand in a subsumption relation , llenee underly-pothesis B the CI , 3 , RG applies only to main verbs , and the tree in Fig . 6 is the only tree admitted . 
6 Computational Consequences
Finally , we will consider the computational implications that the adoption of l fypothesis B has for the processing of LRs in a computational system  . 
Since consensus on how to provide an adequate denote to nal semantics for I  , Rs has not yet been reached , it would go well beyond the scope of this paper to develop a fully worked-out proposal on how to process lJs  . n A very promising approach USee CM cagno and Pollard  ( 1995 ) ~ t t ( lMenrers ( 11995 ) for further discussion . 
5 47 on how to integrate LRs into processing systems for HPSG has been developed independently by wm Noord and Bouma  ( 1994 ) and by Meurers and Minnen ( 1995 )  . It turns out that the conclusions reached in this paper can be easily integrated in the general framework that these authors provide  . 
Common to these two proposals is the idea of treating LRs as  ( ltorn clause ) constraints on LF , s of the kind shown schematically in Fig .  7 . 
derive-lexical-entry ( X0 , Xn):-base-lexical-entry(X0) , lo?-rule(Xo , X , ) ,   . . . , lex-rule , ( X , _ Figure 7: l , exical rules as Horn Clause constraints on relations between lexical entries l  ) e finite clause schema tas in Fig .  7  ( for n0 ) define relations between base LEs listed in the lexicon and derived l  , Es that are obtained via the application of a sequence of LRs  . Each I , R is then viewed as a two-place definite relation as ill ns-\[rated in FiR  . 8 for the l ' Pl , t of Fig . l .

VA\],\[COMPS\[\] . Jl , ' igure 8: The PPI , Rencoded as a definite relation It is important to distinguish two tasks that need to be performed in computing with lexical rules :  12   1  . the algorithm that decides for a given lexica I entry whether a lexical rule is applicable to it  , and 2 . the algorithm that ; computes for a given lexical entry the output specification of the lex~ical rule  , i . e . the derived lexical entry . 
The subsumption test for lexical rule application that we have argued for in this paper paper pertains to the first task  . The execution of the definite clauses of the kind shown schematically in Fig  .  7 , which encode the possible relations between base midderived lexical entries  , pertains to the second task . 
Regarding the first task , in van Noord and Bouma's approach the sequences of lexical rules that are applicable to a given base lexical entry have to be specified by the grammar developer along with delay statements  , which allow goal freezing a trunriffle of not sufficiently in s\[an\[f-ated relations  . In Meurers and Minnen's approach such sequences are automatically generated from  12This distinct km is rightly emphasized by Cabcagno and Pollard  ( 1995 )  . 
the set of base lexical entries and the set of lexical rules specified by the grammar  . The allowable sequences of lexi ( ' alrules are compiled into finite state automata which are in turn encoded as de \[: inite clause attachments obase lexical entries  . 
Note thai ; both approaches are general enough to accommodate different assumptions about the applicability of lexicat rules to lexical entries  , i . e . they are compatible with both I typotheses A and B  . Whether or not at given lexical rule applies to a  . lexical entry in van Noord and louma'sal ) proach needs to be stipulated by the grarn mar writer who is in theory fl : ee to use either a unification or subsumption test  . In Meurers and Min-hen's approach the deduction rules for automatically generating a finite-state encoding of lexical rules can likewise be based on a subsumption check or a unification clieck  . In this paper we have argued on empirical grollnds that subsumption should be the relevant operatiw-  , criterion . The theoretical results of t it (' , present paper c~m therefore be straightforwardly integrated into a lexical rule compiler of the sort described by Meurers and Minneu in which applicability of lexieal rules is checked automatically under subsumption  . 
7 Conc lus ion '\[' his paper has discussed a number of lexical rules from recent IIPSG analyses of German  ( llin-richs and Nakazawa 1994 ) and has shown that the grammar ill some eases vastly ow ~ r generates and in other cases introduces massive spurious structural ambiguity  , if lexical rules apply under unification Y ~ l\ [owew'  . r , no such problems of overgeneration or spurious ambiguity arise  , if a lexical rule applies to a giwmle xieMentry iff the lexical entry is subsumed by the  . lefthand side of the lexica\[rule . Finally we have shown that tile subsumption test for the applicability of lexical rules  (  ; anbe . integrated straightforwardly into the proposals by wmN oord and lk  ) mna ( 1994 ) and by Meurers and Minnen ( 11! ) 95 ) of how to implemeut lexical rules in a processing system for IIPSG  . 
1 3\[t is worth pointing out that the importauce of subsunlption tt~s been noted for other linguistic phenomena as well  . \]h filding proposals originating with ( \] azdar et al ( 1985 )  , Bayer and Johnson (1995) ha . vepointed out that the grammar of ( cross-categorical ) co-or dimttion for English will make the right predictions if them other category  ot7 the conjunction schema is required to subsume tile c~t tegory of ca  . oh coI0 un(:t . \[~ y contrast , if the feb\[lion between them other category ttnd each daughter category is that of unifial fility  , ' then the resulting gra . mm~tr vastly overge , erates .
