Tiffspaper focuses on anaphora interpreted as referring t ' o entities of type event and action  . It considers two issues : ( i ) what aspects of the discourse give evidence of the events and the actions the speaker is talking about  , and ( ii ) how actions and events are represented in the discourse in order to be able to refer to them anaphorically  . 
1 Introduction
When people speak or Write , they refer to things , objects , events , actions , facts or states that they ( or other people ) referred to before . They use certain words to " refer " or " point " to those things : previously mentioned  . Such context-dependent reference is called , anaphora , and the words used to " refer " are called anaphors  . 
Some examples of anaphors include pronoun such as he  , she , it ' and noun phrases that contain this ; that , these and those . Consider for example the following pair of sentences :  ( 1 ) U : I want to move a 0 lock of text as a unit . How do I do it ? The it in the second sentence is the anaphor which points back to the action that the user wants to perform  , described in the first sentence . 
In our communications , we benefit from the use of anaphoric forms which make our interactions more coherent and intelligible  . 
If we were forced to describe very thing explicitly  , our discourse would become very complex , long and time-consuming . Moreover it could become confusing and lead to potential misunderstandings  . Such is the case in the following example which is similar to example  ( 1 ) but in which a pronoun is not used in the second sentence :  ( 2 ) U : I want to move a block of text as a unit . How do I move a block of text as a unit ? We as listeners may find these-sentences vryodd and lacking coherence  . We may wonder about he need to repeat the description which has already been introduced  . If the speaker fails to use the pronoun , ' the listener may believe that he is meant to conclude something special from this unnatural usage  . This conclusion may be unwarranted . 
The work we present here describes the process of dealing with anaphoric language when the reference is to events and actions  . 
It considers two issues : ( i ) what aspects of the discourse give evidence of the events and the a ~ tions the speaker is talking about  , and ( ii ) how actions and events are represented in the discourse in order to be able to refer to them anaphorica Uy  . The overall goal is to make natural language communication between human beings and machines more robust and coherent  . This can be done by providing computer systems with the ability to adequately generate actions in a similar way to how human being sdoit  . To illustrate the problem that we are dealing with  , we use some examples taken from a set of natural anguage transcripts about the EMACS text editor  . The users were given a task to perform using EMACS and at the same time they were able to ask an expert about he various things they could do in EMACS  . The goal of the interaction was for the users to learn how to use the EMACS editting system  . 
In the next section we will describe how we view discourse models along with the representation f entities which form part of them  . In section 3 we describe a representation f those entities based on the language used  . We propose a generalization f that representation which allows us to have access to the different entities characterized by the text  . In section 4 we relate the proposed representation with the particular pronouns used to refer to events  , based on some data analysis . We conclude by giving a brief summary of what the advantages of the proposed representation are  . 
2 Discourse Models
An overall concern of this work is to describe how communication is done via discourse  . A piece of discourse is a set of sentences or pieces of text that are spoken by one or more speakers  . When we talk about discourse , we usually indicate the fact that those sentences in the discourse are connected in some way that makes them comprehensible and coherent  . Speakers do so by attempting to get their listeners to construct an appropriate model : a discourse model  . A discourse model is viewed as containing representations of entities  , along with their properties and relations they participate in \[ Webber  1982  , Helm 1982 , Kamp 1984\] . The key , then , in successful communication is for the speaker to transmit as much information about hose representations of the entities  , their properties and relations to the listener . Usually , this cannot be done in a single utterance , so it requires reference back to things mentioned previously  . The speaker refers to a particular representation fapers on  , object , action or event in his or her discourse model and he or she can do so by using a pronoun  , a definite noun phrase , or a form such as do it , do that . The speaker expects the listener to ( i ) have in his or her discourse model a representation for those objects  , actions or events ( or to be able to create one with minimal effort )  , and ( ii ) make the link between the referent 1 and the representation f the entity . 
Discours entities can represent objects , sets , actions , events , and facts which are viewed as individuals . The referent of a definite pronoun is then an entity in the speaker's discourse model which  , given the goal of the communication , is expected to exist X Researeh in linguistics has defined the problem of anaphom as that of finding the antecedent of an anaphoric expression  , that is , finding the word or phrase to which the anaphor is linked  . In this work , the problem of anaphom is defined not solely as that of identifying the antedecent but how the referent is found  . 
We consider the antecedent to be the linguistic text which gives rise to an entity  , as compared to a referent which is a nonlinguistic entity  . 
also in the listener's model , hithenext section , we describe how discours entities describing events or actions can be represented in a discourse model in order to indicate what they make available for future reference  . 
3 Formalizing the Representation 3 . 1 Characterization First , let us consider what characterizes actions or events  . In general , each sentence gives rise to an event . Similarly , an action is considered to be part of that event . As a way to establish the differences linguistically  , we describe actions as being characterized by the predicate of the sentence  ( the verb phrase ) and events as being characterized hythew hole sentence  . Therefore , we consider actions to be part of events . This notion is similar to Jackendoff's who notes that " sentences that express\[ACTIONS \] are a subset of those that express\[EVENTS\]"\[ Jaekendoff  1983\]   ( p .  179) . He proposes introducing " what happened was " as a diagnostic for\[EVENTS\]and " what x did " as a diagnostic for\[ACTIONS\]  . So we have ( 3 ) What happened was that the pigran away . ~EVENT and (4) What Fleddid was run away . ~ ACTION Withiu this view , " an\[EVENT\]that is also an\[ACTION\] involves a character with a special role-the one who is performing the \[ ACTION\]  , " called the\[ACTOR\](p .  180) . 
Consider for example : (5) Mary deleted the region . 
Here , the action of deleting , which occurred in some past time , was performed by Mary and it was done on the region  .   2 The ' delete ' action relates Mary and the region . 
Events correspond to the conjunction of the action predicate with other predicates described in the sentence such as time  , place , along with the agent performing the action . Tense and aspect usually indicate the sense of time in an event  . The tense indicates present , past , or future and the aspect indicates the perfect ( completion ) and progressive ( continuous ) forms . In general , they are indicated syntactically by certain verbs and/or the auxiliaries  . For instance , the auxiliary verb gives us a sense of whether the event is occurring  ( presen 0 , occurred(past ) , will occur ( future ) or is just hypothesized-as well as whether an event is continuous or it has been completed  .   3 Events and actions usually have associated with them a time interval  . This time interval can have a well defined beginning and/or end  . There may also exist events which occur as points  , that is , their beginning and end times are the same as well as those in which there is no endorno beginning  . These are among the issues that provide us with information about the event or the action  . There is a vast literature of these subjects including works by \[ Vendler  1967  , Mourelatos 1978 , Dowty 1986 , Hinrichs 1986 , Moens et al 1987 , Passonneau 1987\]to mention some . 
2In EMACS , a region is a block of text defined by the mark at one end and the cursor at the other end  . More precisely , it is the area of the buffer between the dot and the mark  . 
a English as two divisions for aspect : ( i ) Progressive ( verb to be and the verbal form-ing ) and non-Progressive , and ( it ) Perfect ( verb to have and Past Participle ) and mm-PerfecLEnglish also has a separate Habitual  ( which occurs only in the past tense )  , using the auxiliary form used to . The habitual can be replaced by its non-habitual equivalent  , i . e . the non-habitual does not exclude habitual meaning\[Comrie  1976\]  . 
To summarize , our characterization fevents is based on individual sentences  . Each event includes an action predicate which , along with other predicates describing tense , aspect , and the agent performing the action constitutes the particular event  . 
3.2 Representation fEvents
Given our characterization f events and actions as described before  , and assuming a syntactic representation for each sentence  , the next step is to describe the kind of ( semantic ) representation we use to characterize those events  . Many representations for events have been proposed to handle similar issues as we describe here\[Davidson  1967  , Moore 1981 , Neale 1987\] . The representation we have chosen is AProlog , a for tnaIlogical representation described by \[ Miller et al  1986\]  . This approach allows us to represent entities describing events and actions in a logical and complex way  . In this representation , the logical form describes the events that characterize the sentence  ( as compared to a proposition or individual )  , therefore allowing subsequent references to any one of the events described by the sentence  . For example , (6) Mary types control-W . 
which is usually represented as type ( Mary , control-W ) , will get mapped onto the following semantic representation :  3v\[type   ( Mary , control-W , v)\] , which posits an individual typing event following \[Davidson  1967\]  . 
From this semantic representation , we obtain the action described by the sentence which corresponds to its predicate  ( e . g . ' type control-W ' in this example ) . This action can be represented in terms of ) ~ predicates as in , 
Ax .\[ tvpe(x , control-W , e)\].
The sentence characterizes an event description which is represented as E : A e  . \[ type ( Mary , control-W , e ) A present ( e)\] , meaning that E is an entity describable as ' the event in which Mary types control-W'  . This is the entity associated with the event description characterized by the sentence  . Present ( e ) means that the event occurs now . 4 As a way of illustrating the representation , consider an example : ( 7 ) John was shot in broadday light in Philadelphia . 
which can be represented as follows : during ( daylight_hours , e ) A in ( Philadelphia , e)A past(e)\] . 
4\[Hobbs 1985\] describes a similar approach by introducing what he calls a " nominalization " operator ': p~p ': Corresponding to every nary predicate p there will be an  ( n + 1 ) -ary predicate p ' whose first argument can be thought of as the condition that holds when p is true of the subsequent arguments  . 
Thus if run (1) means that John runs , run'(E , l ) means that E is a running event by John , or John's running . . . . . . The effect of this notational maneuver is to provide handles by which various predications can be grasped by higher predications  ( p .  62) . 

Here , E ( r ) -~ can be described as ' the event in which John was shot in broad  . daylight in Philadelphia ' ) E ( r ) 4 corresponds to the real world event description in which John was shot which took place at a time during the day light_hours  , in Philadelphia . z is the person who did the shooting , who is not explicitly mentioned in the sentence . Here , past(e ) is defined as past(e)--? , time(e ) < now . 
SoE ( r ) -~ makes a predication about the event in which John was shot and the details that form part of that predication  . 
Given this representation f the event , the next issue is how to generate references to that event  . That is , we want to be able to generate references to ( 7 ) as in: ( 8 ) John was shot in broadday light in Philadelphia . It happened at 10 am . 
it = the event in which John was shot in broad day light in 

(9 ) John was shot in broadday light in Philadelphia . It shocked mevery much . 
it = the event in which John was shot in broad day light in 

(10 ) John was shot in broadday light in Philadelphia . It has never happened before . 
it = an event in which someone was shot in broad daylight in Philadelphia  . 
(11 ) John was shot in broadday light in Philadelphia . AIPacino haddone it last year in a warm summer evening in New York 

it = shoot someone/John.
(12 ) John was shot in broadday light in Philadelphia . That would never happen in Bogot Lthat = an event in which someone was shot in broadday light  . 
As seen in these examples , the referents of the pronouns may have been introduced explicitly  . That is , the anaphoric expression in the second sentence can refer to the specific event as characterized by the sentence or to a less specific event than the one described by the sentence  . Therefore , what we need is to have access to the specific event description along with more general event descriptions of the one characterized by the sentence  . This representation allows us to do so by being able to perform a generalization on the specific event description as we show in the next section  . 
3 . 3 Generalization of Event Descriptions In general , each event represented as described in the previous section denotes a set of events  . Given that there are entities corresponding to events represented in the discourse model  , each of which can have one or more descriptions , we can generalize to obtain the various descriptions  . Generalization is defined as follows : Given an event description  E1 and an event description E2  , 5As pointed out by \[ Sidner 1982\] , referring expressions specify discourse n-tities ; referring expressions may co-specO~y the same discourse entity  ; discourse entities represent objects or events in the world and people refer to objects and events in the world when they use referring expressions  . 
we say that E1 generalizes E2 if every event description denoted by E2 is a member of the set of event descriptions denoted by El  . 6 As we generalize tile representation f the event that we have obtained for each sentence  , we incrementally obtain event descriptions of that event  . These event descriptions are available in the discourse model for future reference  . The generalization of the events fits in an ordered structure in which the most specific representation  ( corresponding to the description of the event characterized by the original sentence  ) is at the bottom and the most general at the top . So if we consider ( 7 ) again ( 7 ) John was shot in broadday light in Philadelphia . 
along with its representation
E (7) -1:A e . \[3x\[shoot(z , John , e )\] A during ( daylight_hours , e ) A in ( Philadelphia , e)A past(e)\] . 
We can generalize it to ' any person y ' ( being shot ) as follows:
E(r)-2:~e . \[3x3y\[shoot(x , y , e )\] A during ( daylight_hours , e ) A in ( Philadelphia , e)A past(e)\] . 
We can further generalize to ' any place p ' and obtain : 
Eft)-3: Ae . \[~x3y\[shoot(x , y , e )\] A during ( daylight_hours , e)h3p\[in(p , e)\]A past(e)\] . 
And we can continue to generalize this last representation adobtain the following : 
E (7) - 4: A e . \[3x3y\[shoot(x , y , e )\] A during ( daylight_hours , e)A past(e)\] . 
E ( , ) - 5: A e . \[3z3y\[shoot(z , y , e)\]^3p\[in(p , e)\]A past(e)\] . 
E ( , ) . ~: Ae . \[3~3y\[shoot(x,y,e)\]^past(e)\] . 
Eft)-,:Ae.\[3x3y\[shoot(x,y,e)\]\].
As specified by the generalization , every member of E(r ) - ~ is a member of E(r)-r . This set of generalizations can be ordered in a graph-like structure as shown in Fig  .  1 . 
In this structure , which provides a partial ordering of the events , some events are more specific than others . The structure is partially ordered , with the < relation .   7 We have not generalized to ' anytime t ' in the ! during'predicate because all events occur during some time  . Note that at the very bottom of our graph we could generalize on the predicate'shoot'so as to have an event describing " somebody doing something " which is common to all events  . We have chosen not to do so in order to have access to the initial referent of the pronoun  , characterized by the predicate of the event . 
The generalization structure provides the potential referents for the pronouns as they appear in examples  ( 8 )  ,  (9) ,  (10) ,  (12) , and (11) . Consider for instance , the pair of sentences in (10) , where the referent of the pronoun it in the second sentence is " an event in  6This definition is based on Millet and Nadathur's definition of subsumption  ( = generalization )  . They define it in terms of concepts as follows : " a concept Ca subsumes another concept  ( ? 2 if every element of the set denoted by C~isa member of the set denoted by  C1" lMitletet al1986\]   ( 13 .  6) . 
7A relation ~ is called a partial order if it is reflexive  ( p ~ p )  , antisymmetric ( p "< qAq ~_ p == ~ p = q) , and transitive ( p ~_ qAq~r ~ p "< r) .

Philadelphia ' which someone was shot in broad daylight in Philadelphia  . ," . This event description is E ( 7 ) -4 which is available in the generalization graph . The same is true for the pair of sentences in ( 11 ) where the referent of the pronoun it is E ( 7 )  . 7 , and the pair ( 12 ) where the referent of the pronoun that in the second sentence is E  ( r ) - s , both of which are available thruthe generalization graph  . 
Bauerle has proposed an alternative method for dealing with event reference within the framework of Disconrse Representation Theory  ( DRT ) \[Kamp1984\] . A she points out , the problem is not that simple because by introducing an event-argument  , the possible referents for event-anaphora are only linked to the event-token  ( the specific event description ) and not to the type ( the generalized descriptions ) \[Baerle1988\] ( p .  21) . The representation ut lined in this paper does provide us with access to the event-token and its generalization allows us to obtain the types  . 
4 Relationship between Pronouns and their

In addition to relating a particular pronoun and its referent  , either as a specific event-token or as an event -type obtained from the generalization f the event -token  , there are cases in which the pronoun is also linked to not just an ' individual event but to either a sequence of events or even a particular event within a sequence  ( usually the last event in the sequence )  . 
As described in \[ Schuster 1988\] , we have studied the relationship between the pronouns and their referents  , within a given text describing a sequence of events  . We focused on the use and interpretation of tim pronouns it and that when referring those events and/or actions  , given the representation described in t be previous section  . Initially , we were interested in identifying tile relationship between a specific pronoun such as that or it and an event as its referent  . We found out that a particular pronoun could act as a referent of one of the following :  1  . One event . 
2 . A sequence of events , the pronoun referring to the entire sequence as one  . 
3. The last event in a sequence.
"4 . A pair of events related by two possible relations : genera  . 
tion and enablement , as proposed by \[ Goldman 1970\] and developed by \[ Pollack 1986a\]  . 
We will describe a chone of ' these cases , along with some examples and relate them to the representation we introduced in section  3  . 
1 . One event Consider the following text : ( 13 ) E : Write a simple macro that does three forward char-aeters  . Try that . 
We can represent the first sentence in the pair as described before : E  ( 13 ) -I : A e . \[\[ write(U , 3fe_macro,e)\]A present(e)\] . 
Here ,   E03-x can be described as ' the event in which U writes a simple macro that does three forward -characters  , and takes place at the present time ' . U in this case is the user interacting with the expert  . Then , the referent of the pronoun that in the second sentence is the event represented  asE03  ) -l . 
605 2 . A sequence of events Consider : (14) E : . Tokilla region , the whole tiring at onetime you should set the mark-  ( esc ) -M-a the top of the region , then move the cursor down to the bottom of the region and type  ( esc ) control-K . This will kill the region . 
The pronoun this refers to the entire sequence of events  . 
As in the previous case , if we represent each sentence as a A expression , we have access to the various descriptions of the event corresponding to each sentence and we can refer to them via the pronoun  . 
3 . Last event Consider the following example , where the pronoun it refers to the last event in the sequence :  ( 15 ) E : Tokilla word , you have to movet be cursor to the beginning of that word and type control-D  . Goahead , doit . 
4 . Generation and Enablement In analyzing the data we ' found the need for two important relationships : generation and enablement\[Pollack  1986b  \] . Generation is defined as follows : If an agent performs one action and thereby  , without any effort on his/her part , does another , then we can say that his/her performance of the former action " generated " the performance of the latter  . For example ,   ( 16 ) E : Do this : set a " mark " at some point ( any 01d point ) by typing ( esc ) -M . It will say " mark set ", try it . 
(17) E : ( esc)-M will give set-mark . Doit.
In both cases , the referent ( s ) of the pronoun it can be either " setting the mark " or " typing  ( esc ) -M " or even both : " setting the mark by typing ( esc ) -M " . By viewing the referent in terms of the generation relationship  , we can claim that " U typing ( esc ) -Mata given time generates U setting the mark at that given time "  . This relationship allows us to refer to both or either of the referents without having to make a distinction between the two of them  . Note that generation is a relationship between the specific events  , the event-tokens and not the types . 
Enablement , as opposed tO generation , has been described as follows : if an agent performs an action and thereby puts the world in a state in which a second action will generate a third action  , then we can say that the agent's performance of the first action enables the generation of the third by the second  . For example ,   ( 18 ) U : I want to move the cursor 20 characters to the right . 
How can I do it ?
E : Like all other commands in EMACS , these commands can be given arguments which cause them to be executed repeatedly  . The way you give a command a repeat count is by typing control-U and then the digits before you type the command  . For instance , control-U20 ( RIGHT-ARROW moves forward 20 characters . 
Goahead , try that.
In . this example , the pronoun that refers to the entire enablement relationship : " U typing control-U enables a given number  ( 20 ) and the RIGHT-ARROW key to be typed which in term generates the cursor to move  20 characters forward " . 
U typing control-U is viewed as an enablement relationship : if U does not type control-U and only types  20 followed by the RIGHT-ARROW , U's desired goal of making the cursor move 20 characters forward will not be accomplished . 
To summarize , for each representation f the individual events characterized by each sentence  , we can relate the pronoun to the event , to a sequence of events , or to events related by either the generation or enablement relationships  . 
5 Summary
We have defined an approach for representing actions and events in discourse in order to refer to them anaphorically  . The main concern has been to describe what aspects of the discourse give evidence of ? events and actions and how the sevents and actions are represented in order to refer to them appropriately  . This representation has'the advantage that it allows us to create appropriate descriptions of actions and events which are available for future reference in the discourse model  . We have shown how to generaliz event ? descriptions  , oth at the general event descriptions can in turn be associated with additional event entities required by the use of particular anaphoric expressions  . We have also related the event representation described here to anaphoric pronouns  , given that the pronouns can refer to more than one event  .
