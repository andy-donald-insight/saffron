A discourses lralegy is a strategy for communicaling with another agent  .

( ) he slralegy that supports deliberation is the Explici I-Warrant strategy  , as in 1 . The WARRANT inlb can be used by the he ~ uer in deliberating whether loACCEPT or REJI i  ( ? Ttile speakef's I'R OPOSAI , in la .   1 An amdysis of proposals in a corpus of 55 problem-solving dialogues SllOWS lhat communicating agents don't always include warrants in a prol  ) osal , and suggest a number of hypolheses a botlt which factors alfecll heir decision IWalker  , 1993; Pollack el al . , 19821 . 
Consider a situalion in which an agent Aw~mts ~ u ~agent B to accept a proposal P  . If B is a ' helpful ' agent ( ll Olla Hl . Ol ) Ol/lOtlS) , B will accepl A's proposal with oul a wammt . Altemalively , if B deliberates whether to accept 1 ; but B knows of no competing options , I henP will be the bestel ) lion whether or not Alells P , the WatW ~ Ultlor P . 
Since a w ~ u ' , ' ant makes the dialogue longer , tile Explicit-Wml ' ~ mt strategy might be inefficient whenever either of these situalions hold  . 
Now consi(lelasiluali Oll where P , is HI ) at lt Oll Olll Ol Sagenl IG alliers ,  19911 . Balways deliberates every proposed and B probably knows of oplions which compete with proposal P  . Then Bc~umot decide whelher to accept P with oul awarrant  . Supposedly agenl A should omit a warrant is if it is a h'eady believed by B  , so that the speaker in 1 woukl not have said It's shorter if she believed that the hem ' or knew that file Wahlul St  . mute was shorter . However , consider 2, said in discussing which

I The telalion between a WARRANT and the PR(II , OSICO lll-municative act is similar to the MOTIVATION relation of \[ Moore and Paris  , 1993; Mann and Thompson ,  1987\] . A WARRANT is always optional ; this is consistent with the RST fl'anle wolk in which all satellites are optional information  .

A Warrant IR/J such a . S that in 2 suggest stllat B's cognilive limitations\[nay be a factor in what A cllooses to say  , so thai even if B knows awlu ' rant for adopting A 's proposed  , what is critical is whetl m , ' the warrant is salient lot B , i . e . whether the warn mt is a h'eady accessible in B's working memory\[Prince  , 1981; Baddelcy ,  1986\] . 11 the w~u'rant is not already salient , then B must either infer or retrieve the wlurant information or obtain it from an external source in order to evaluate A's proposed  . Thus A's slrategy choice may depend oil A's model of B's alteutional stale  , as well as the costs of retrieval ~ md inference as opposed to communication  . In other words , A may decide thalitise ~ Lsier to just say the warrant rather than require B to infer or retrieve it  . 
Finally , the task determines whether there are penalties lor leaving aw ~ ur ~ mt implicit and relying on B  1o inter or relrieve it . Some tasks require that two agents agree oil tile reason slot adopting a proposal  , e . g . in order to ensure robustness in situations of environmental change  . 
() ther tasks , such ~ tsammmgement/union negotiation , only require the agents to agree on the actions to be cluried out and each agent can have its own reason slot wanting tl ~ ose actions to be done withoul affecting success in the lask  . 
Figure 1 summ ~ uizes these hypotheses by proposing a hypothetical decision lree for an agent's choice of whetlmr to use the Explicit-W~n-rlmts rategy  . The choice is hypothesized to depend oil cognitive properties of B  , e . g . what B knows , B's an entiom d state , lind B's processing capabilities , as well as properties of the tiks k and the communication cl~annel  . To my knowledge , all previous work on di~dogne has simply assumed that  , ' magent should never tell ~ magen ! facts that the other agent already knows  . The hypotheses in figure 1 seem coin-pie\[elyplausible , but the relationship of cognitive ffort to dildogue behavior has never been explored  . Given these hypotheses , what is required is a way to test the hypothesized relationship of t~tsk and cognitive factors to effective discourse strategies  . Section 3 describes a new method for testing hypotheses about ellective discourse stralegies in dialogue  .

While the AWM model is extremelys in > pie ,  \[ , and auer showed thai it could be pm'a meterized lo 1il many empirical resells on human memory and learning \[ Baddeley  ,  19861 .

Whell Illagell trchieve silenls 1o 111 in elllOfy , search slarls from tile current poinlef Iocalion and spreads outse  , ' u'chradius : radius is defined in Hiunming distance  . 
For ex ~ unple if the current memory pointer loci is  ( 0 0  ( 1 )  , the locidist~mce1 away would be ( 0 1 0 )   ( 0 -1 0 )   ( 00 l )   ( 0 0 - 1 )   ( - 1 0 0 )   ( 1 0 0 )  . The actual ocations are cldculated modulo the memory size  . The limit on the search radius defines the capacity of attention/working memory and hence defines which stored beliefs and intentions are 
SAI , IENT.
Th cradius of tile search sphere in the AWM model is used as the par  , ' uneter for Design-Worldagents'resource-bound on attentional capacity  . In the experiments below , memory is 16x16x16 and tile radius pa-rm neler v~n'ies between 1and   16  , where AWM of 1 gives severely attention limited agents imd AWM of  16 means that everything an agent knows is accessible  .   3 This pa-rluneter lets us distinguish between an agent's ability to access all the inlimnation stored in its memory  , lind the effort involved in doing so . 
The advantages of the AWM model is that it was shown to reproduce  , in simulation , mlmy results on human memory ~ mdlem'ning . Because searchs t~n'ts from the current pointer location  , items that have been stored most recently are more likely to be retrieved  , predicting recency effects \[ BM deley ,  19861 . Because items that are stored in multiple locations are more likely to be retrieved  , t be model predicts fiequency effects \[ Hiutzmmm and Block  , 1971 I . Because items are stored in chrono-Iogic N sequence  , the model produces natural associativity effects \[L and aner  ,  19751 . Because deliberation and means-endre~tsoning can only operate on salient belietls  , limited attention produces a concomitlmt in l ) rential limitation , i . e . if a belief is nol salient it cannot be used in deliberation or m cans-end-relts on iug  . This means that mistakes that agents make in their planning process have a plansible cognitive basis  . Agents can both fail to access a belief that would id low them to produce  , an optim ~ dplan , its well as make a mistake in pl~mning if a belief about bow the world has changed its a result of pllmning is not sl dicnt  . I ) epending on the preceding discourse , and the agent's attention ld capacity , the propositions that imagent knows may or may not be salient when a propose dismade  . 
Another hypothetical riveter was the relative cost of re-trievld and communication  . A WM~d so gives ns a way to measure tilen mnber of retriev~ds from memory in terms of tile number of locations searched to find a proposition  . Theiun ount of effort required li ) reach retrieval step is a parmnetel , it sistile cost of each inference step lind the cost of each communicated message  . These cost parluneters supporl modeling v ~ uious cognilive mchitec-tures  , e . g . vmyingtile cost of retrieved models different assumptions ahout memory  . For example , if retrieval is free then ~ dl items in working memory meinstfmtly accessible  , as they would be if they were stored in registers with litstp ~ uallel access  . If AWM is set to 16 , but re-lrievz disn't free , tile model approximates slow spreading 3The size of memory was determined as adequate for pro ducing the desired level  ~1' variation in tile current task across all the experimental variables  , while slill making it possible to I'1 . 1 n a large iltlnlher el " simtllalions over night wherl agents have access to all of their memory  . In order Iouse the AWM model in a different ask , the experimenter might want to explored ilferent sizes lbr memory  . 
activation that is quite effortful , yet the agent still has the ability to access ~ dl of memory  , given enough time . If AWM is set lower than 16 ~ md retrievl disn't lie e , then we model slow spreading activation with a timeout whene/fort exceeds a certain ~ u noun t  , so that imagent does not have the ability to access all of memory  . 
It does not make sense to fix absolute v ~ duesli ) r the re-trievl d , inference lind communication cost plu ~ uncters in relation to human processing  . However , Design-World supports exploring issues about he relative costs of vlu'-ions processes  . These relative costs might v , ' u ' y depend-ing , on the language that the agents are communicating with  , properties of the communication channel , how smtu't tile agents , arc , how much time they have , lind what the demands of the ti~sk are\[N or m~m and Bobrow  ,  1975\] . 
Below we vary tile relative cost of communication and retrieval  . 
Fin ~ dly , we hypothesized that the Explicit-Wm3'ant strategy may be beneficial if the relationship betweeuthe wlm'imt and the proposed must be mutu ~dly believed  . 
Thus the delinition of success for the task is a Design-World plu '  , ' uneter : the Stimd~u'd task does not require a shared wlu'r~mt  , whereas the Zero NonMatching Beliefs task gives a zero score to any negotiated plan without agreed -upon warrants  .

In the St , ' uld ~ u'dt&sk , agent sm'en't required to sh , ' ue beliefs about the value of a proposed , so remembering what pieces they have is more importmlt than remembering their value  . 
However , figure 4 shows that Explicit-Wm'rm~t is ben-elici~d when retrieval is one tenthtile cost of communication : rod inference  .

At AWM parameter setting sel'16 , where agenls have lheability to search all their beliefs lk  ) rwarrants , the saving in processing time is substantial . Again at the lowest AWM seltings , the slrategy is not beneficial because it displaces information about other pieces fronl AWM  . However in figure 4 , in conlr&st wilh ligure 3 , retrieval has an associated cost .

Explicit Warrant is detrimental if Communication is 

If we ch~mge the relative cosls of the dillerent processes in the siluation  , we change whether a strategy is beneli-cial . Figure 5 shows that if connnnnication cost is 10 , ~mdinlerence and rolrieval ~ u'eli'ee , then the Explicit-Wlu'i ' ~ nll strategy is DI , ITRIMI\]N'IAL(KS for AWM1 to 5> . 23, p < . 01) . This is because the Explicit-Warr~mts lralegy increases the number of ntter ~ mces required to perform I he task  ; it doubles the number of messages in every proposal  . If communication is expensive compared to retrieval  , communication cost can dominate the other benelits  . 
l !; x plicit Warrant Achieves a High Level of

If we change lhedolinition of success in the ta:sk  , we change whether as lrategy is benelicial . When the l&sk is Zero-Nouii latching-Beliefs , the Explicit-W~u'ranl strategy is beneficial oven if retrieval is fie e  ( KS > . 23 for AWM ll'onl2 lo11, p < . 01 ) The warranlinl \] J rnlation that is redundantly provided is exactly tiltin lk  ) rmation that is needed in order to achieve inatching beliel \ s about I hew arranls for intended actions  . Tile strategy virtually gu~u ~ nllees thai the agenls will agree on there & sonsl  ( /l'carrying onla particular course of action . The fact that relrieval is ind clcrminate produces this effect  ; a simi-hitresnll is oblained when wm'r~mls are required and relriewll costs some ihing  . 
To my great surprise , I he benelicial effect of Explicit-W ~ urall l for the Zero-NonMatching-Beliefs task isso robust thal even if communication cost is  10 and re-irieval and inference arefl+ee , Explicil-Warrant is better than AII-hnplicit at AWM of  3  ? . . 11 ( KS > . 23, p < . 0 l ) . See ligure 6 . In other words , even whenevery extra WARRANT message incurs a penalty of  10 poinls , if the task is Zero-NonMatching-Beliefs , agents using Explicit-W ~ u ' rant do belier .

These result suggesls thai including w~u'rants is highly effective when agents must agree on a specilic w~ua ~ u/t  , if lhey are at lenlion-limited to any extent .

We showed thaiw ~ ur ~ mts ~ u ' e useful when the task requires agreement on the warrant  , when the win'rant is not currently s~dient , when retrieval of tile w~u-r~mt is indeterminate , or when retriewd has some associated cost , and that warranls hinder perforn lance if communication is costly ~ ul diftimw ~ urant c~ul displace in li  . ) rnlation that is needed to complete the task , e . g . when AWM is very limited and wm'r\[mts~ue not required to be shared  . 
Tile method used here is a new experimental method -elegy for computational linguistics that supports testing hypotheses about benelici ~ disconrse strategies \[ Carletta  , 1992; Pollack and Ringuelle ,  1990\] . The Design-Worlden vironment is b~tsed on a cognitive model of limited attention ~ md supports experimenls on the interaction of discourse strategies with agents ' cognitive limitations  . The use of the method and the focns of l his wtnk are novel : previous work has l ~  ) CliSed Oil determining nnderlying mechanisnls ? ~ r cooperative strategies rather than on investigating when a slrategy is el Iective  . 
To my knowledge , no previous work on di ; doguel/~tseverargued that conversational agents ' resonroe limits a real najor factor in determining ? IIective conversational strategies in collaboration  . Tim resulls presented here suggest that cooperative strategies cannot be delhied in the abslracl  , but cooperation arises from the interaction of two agents in dialogue  . If one agent has limited working memory , then the ( ) thor agenl can make the di~doguc go more slnoothly by adopting a strategy that makes de -liberative premises salient  . In other words , slrategies ~ ue cooperative for certain conversational p  ; u'tners , in/der particular task delinitions , lorp ~ uticul ~ u communicalion situations . 
Here we compared two discourse strategies : All -hnplicit ~ ul  ( l Explicit-Warr ~ mh Explicit-W ; uranlisa type of discourse stralegy called ~ m Attelition strategy in \[ W  ; dkel ;   1993\] because its main lunction is to manipulate agents ' altenlional slate  . Elsewhere we showferential complexity is higher I hall in the Standard " l  , u , ~k\[R ~ unbow and Walker , 1994; Walker , 1994 al ;   ( 2 ) IRUs that make in tL'rences explicit can help inlbrence limited agents per lorm as well as logic  ; ally omniscient ones
