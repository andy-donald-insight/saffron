Japanese dialogue containing zero pronouns is analyzed for the purpose of automatic JapaneseEnglish conversation translation  . Topic-driven Discourse Structure is formalized which identifies mainly nonhuman zero pronouns as a byproduct  . Other zero pronouns are handled using cognitive and sociolinguistic information in honorific  , deictic , speech act and mental predicates . These are integrated into the model . 
1. Introduction
An approach is proposed to automatically analyze Japanese dialogue containing zero pronouns  , the most frequent type of anaphora which corresponds in fimction to personal pronouns in English  . Zero pronoun is defined as an obligatory case noun phrase that is not expressed in the utterance but can be understood through other utterances in the discourse  , context , or out-of-context knowledge . 
Gaps identifiable by syntactico-semantic means , such as those in relative clauses and a certain type of subordinate verb phrase  , are excluded . The input discourse is conversation carried out in Japanese by typing at computer terminals  , a type of conversation which has been proved to have the thn damental characteristic sommon to telephone conversation  ( Arita et al 1987 )  . 
The key idea of the model is topic , something being talked about in the discourse . This notion derives from the study of theme and theme by the Prague School  ( Firbas 1966 )  . In the following , it is discussed that mainly nonhuman zero pronouns can be identified by means of topic  , and , to do so , a discourse structure on the basis of recursively appearing topics is formalized  . Other zero pronouns , mainly human ones , are identified using cognitive and sociolinguistie information conveyed by honorific  , deictic , and speech act predicates as to how the omitted cases are related to the speaker or hearer  . The cooccurence restriction between subject and predicate that expresses a mental activity is also utilized  . Finally , the interaction among these different factors in zero pronoun identification is discussed  , and a model integrating them is proposed . This is to constitute a part of a machine translation system being developed at the ATR which deals with Japanese-English telephone and inter-terminal dialogue  . 
2. Zeroprm ~ oun's role in discourse
An investigation of simulated Japanese inter -terminal dialogues  ( 94 sentences , 2 dialogue sequences ) and their Englisht ~ anslation has revealed that out of  53 occurrences of personal pronouns in the English translation  ,   51 correspond to zero pronouns in the original Japanese text  . 
Though the size of the data is limited , this coincides well with our intuition about Japanese zero anaphora that it performs discourse -grammatical functions including those played by personal pronouns in English  ( for a discussion to the same effect , see Kameyama 1985) . 
In the same Japanese dialogue data , out of 15 Zero pronouns coreferent with nonhuman antecedents  ,   14 refer to one of the current opics in the discourse  . Out of 74 zero pronouns corresponding to the first and second persons  ,   55 can be identified by means of cognitive and sociolinguistic information in honorific  , deictic , speech act , and mental predicates . The other 19 examples were either set phrases for identifying the hearer  , explaining one's intention , and responding , etc . , or cases understandable only in terms of the total context and situation  . Besides an approach based on heuristic rules , the only possible solution to these would be one with planning and/or script  . I will here concentrate on the major portion of zero anaphora cases that are identifiable by topic continuity or predicate information as to honorificity  , deixis , speech act , or mental activity . 
N . B . Unlike italian , Spanish , etc . , in Japanese predicates grammatical information such as person  , gender and number is not indicated morphologically  . This is one of the reasons we must emphasize pragmatic and discourse-grammatical factors in retrieving information referred to by zero anaphora  . 
3 . Topic-based identification 3 . 1 . PSG treatment of topic and zero pronoun The Japanese topic has the following major characteristics :  ( i ) The topic is marked with a postposition wa and usually  , but not always , preposed .   ( ii ) More than one topic can appear in a simple sentence  . ( iii ) With a certain type of subordinates , the subordinate predicate is controlled obligatorily by a topicalized matrix subject  , but not by an untopicalized one .   ( iv ) The topic represents what is being talked about in the discourse  . 
In the following an intrasentential treatment of ( i ) to ( iii )  , a modified version of Yoshimoto ( 1987 ) is explained . 
It is based on Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar  ( HPSG ) by Pollard & Sag ( 1987 ) and Japanese Phrase Structure Grammar ( JPSG ) by Gunji ( 1987 )  . 
Topic is represented as a value in the TOPIC feature that corresponds to the semantics of topicalized NP  ( s )  . The TOPIC is a FOOT feature that derives from the lexical description of wa  . To deal with multi-topic sentences , the value of TOPIC is a stack that enables embedding of topics  . 
For the type of subordinate whose predicate is controlled by a topicalized matrix subject  , the subordinate-head particle ( to be more exact , ADV head ) is given a feature specification to the effect that the subordinate subject unifies with a topicalized matrix subject  , but not with an untopicalized one . 
This topic description along with other parts of the  779' fundamental grammar of Japanese was implemented on a unificaion-based parser built up by my colleagues Kiyoshi Kogure and Susumu  Kat6   ( Maeda et al 1988 )  . 
The anlysis of ( l-l-a ) is given as ( l-l-b).
(1-1-a ) Sight seeing tour waar i masuka?sight seeing-tour TOP exist-POLQUEST is there asight seeing tour ?   ( I-I-b ) \[\[ HEAD\[\[POS ( part-of-speech ) V\]\[CTYPE ( conjugation-type ) NONC ( noncenJugate ) \]\[CFORM ( conjugation-form ) SENF ( ssntsnce-flnsl ) \]\]\]\[SUBCAT\]\[SEbl\[\[RELN ( rslatlon ) S ( surface ) -REQUEST\]\[AGEN ( agent ) ?

"?" is a prefix for a tag-name representing a token identity of feature structures  . 
Omitted obligatory case NPs , i . e . those which are specified in the lexical description of the predicate as SUBCAT values but are not found explicitly in the sentence  , are represented as values in the SLASH , following HPSG and JPSG . The analysis result of (1-2-a ) is (1-2-b ) . 
(1-2-a )  arimasu.

There is.
(1-2-b ) \[\[HEAD\[\[POSV\]\[CTYPEMASU\]\[CFORMSENF \]\]\]\[SLASH\[\[HEAD\[\[POSP  ( postpositio . )\]  . \[FORM ga\]\[GRF ( grammatieal-function ) SUBJ ( subject ) \]\]\]\[SUBCAT\]\[SEM?x\]\]\]\[ SE~4 \[\[RELNEXIST-I\]\[OBJE?X\]\]\]\] Here the SLASH feature represents that in  ( 1-2-a ) the subject is a zero anaphora . Following JPSG , subcatego-rized-for NPs are assigned to the category P  ( therefore , to be more exact , they are PPs ) , because all ( at least written ) Japanese case NPs are followed by postpositions . 
3 . 2 . Topic-driven discourse structure Based on the intrasentential specification of topicalized sentences given in the previou section  , a discourse-level topic structure is formalized , with zero anaphora being identified at the same time  . 
In (1) , the zero pronoun " W ' in A12 coincides with sight seeing tour , a topic in QI-1 . However , a naive algorithm of finding the most recic fails because of the topics'recursive structure : the zero indirect object in the " lower " one  hiy6 in Q2-1  .

TDS , a discourse model with reeursively occurring topics which is based on the same unification parser as the intrasentential grammar  , identifies zero pronouns as a byproduct of structuring the discourse  . Syntactically , TDS is composed of the following single basic structure :  ( 2 ) Co--"01 . . . On ( n >= 1 ) The intrasentential analysis result of each sentence  , except a multi-topic one , unifies with a C . ? Each C has a feature TOP that indicates a discourse-level topic value in distinction from TOPIC  , an intrasentential topic feature . 
N . B . A sentence with n topics unifies with an a-time deep vertical tree in which a single C is dominated by another  . The leaf node is a C whose TOP value is a stack with all the topics in the sentence  , and each nonterminal node C has a TOP stack containing that of the immediately dominated C minus the first member  . For example , a sentence with three topics t l , t2 , t8 ( in order of appearance ) or responds to the tree:
C\[TOP < tl >\]

CETOP < tz , tl >\]

C\[TOP < t3, t2, tl >\]
In (2), the value of the TOP of each of the C1 . . . . . Cn on the right hand side is a concatenation fits TOPIC value and the TOP value of the lefthand side C  . 
< iTOP >= append(</TOPIC > , <0 TOP >) (1-< i < n)N . B . The rule is stated in an extended version of PATR -I Inotation  . 
"<>" is used to denote afqature structure path , and "=" to denote a token identity relation between two feature structures  . 
Between the first value of the TOP of Co and that of Ciaw hole-part relation holds  . This is stipulated by the knowledge base . 
The value of TOP of C i is set as defaul to that of Ci_l : < iTOP >= d <  i1 TOP > ( 2-<i-<n )  %

The TOP value of the root Cunifies with any feature structure  , i . e . it is T . 
Sentences with a SLASH value are related to TDS by the ibltowing Topic Supplementation Principle  ( TSP )  .

If none of the pairs are unifiable , then the rule does not apply . 
The analysis tree of discours example ( 1 ) is shown as Figurel . . Sentences QI-I , ALl , A12 , and Q3-1 share the common topic . sight seeing tour , and Q2-1 and A2-1 sharehiy () ( expense) . The latter is a subtopic of the tbrmer . 
There are two syntactic possibilities tbr Q3-1's location : it can be either in coordination with QI-I  , At-I , and A1 . 2, or with Q~ . -Iat ) dA2-1 . It ere the former are chosen as its coordinates because the knowledge base presents the infbrmation ~ hat  Q3  . 1' s predicate mdsihotnu ( reserve ) is compatible v cith sight seeing tour , but not with hiy ~( expense ) . Note that , while discourse (1) is being analyzed , zero pronou ~ Js in At-2 , A2-1 , and Q3-1 are also identified . 
( The other ' . ~ero pronoun in Q3-1, i . e . the subject of the sentence , is lef~unspecified here . Its identification needs ~ peechact cal ; egorization f sentences . ) This topic-based approach is in contrast to Kameyama's  , Japanese version ( Kameyama 1985 , Kameyama 1986 ) of " tb cus-based spproach to anaphora by Grosz et al  1983  . In her framewock , subjecthood and predicated eix is play the principal role  , and the fact that topic provides the most important clue to anaphor a identification i actual spoken Japanese discourse is not utilized explicitly  . 
, - L3 ~ Extension of topic introduction
One of the p~'ob\]ems with the topic obased approach is that topics re?erred to by zero pronouns are not always e : ~' pli  ( ' it iy marked by the topic postposition wa . Sometimes , the NPs a *' enever fi ) und in discourse in s ~ rictly the same tbr ~ . , . ~satheya , ' c ~' e covered . To deal with all possible cases , ihrtt ~ erelaboration i the inter-fiel domain of semantics  , p~~t_~matic ~ , and discourse grammar is needed . Here I will limit my attentio , l to cases analyzable by extending the ( : urn'eat method . 
First , a certain type of series of words whose function is  , like wa , to introduce topics into the discourse , such as no h5 ga , nituite desuga , noken desul ~ , a , and noko to desuga , are handled in the same way as wa both syntactically and discourse-grammatically  . 
Second , more complicated cases of topic introduction sentence patterns are also treated  .

A friend of mine wants to participate in the conference  . ( He . . . ) As illustrated in (3) , the sentence pattern < NP ga VEXISTENTIALu/no desuga > is employed to implicitly introduce the NP as a topic into the discourse  . To meet such cases , the lexical description of the topic-introductory ADV head ga is specified so that the SEM value of the subject of the subcategoriz cd-f brex is tential verb unifies with the  ( implicit ) topic of the whole sentence . 
4 . Identification by means of predicate informat ion  4  . 1 . Honorific predicate Japanese has a rich grammatical system of honorlfics  . 
Among them , expressions related to the discussion here are subject-honorific and object-honorific predicates  . Subject-honorific predicate is a form of predicate used to express respecto the person referred to by the subject of the predicate  . Object-honorific predicate is used to express respect to the direct or indirect object of the predicate whose subject  . -agent is the speaker or his/hering roup member . 
In conversation , the omitted subject of subject-honorific predicate is typically the hearer  . And , conversely , the subject of this type of predicate is usually omitted when referring to the hearer  , as in (4) . This is evidently in order to avoid the redundancy  , in case there is no one else worth paying respect to  , of the speaker being explicitly indicated as subject while at the same time the subject identity is virtually limited to the speaker by the predicate'shonorific information  . Likewise , the director indirect object of object . -honorific predicates itypically the hearer and the subject is typically the speaker  , and the two NPs are usually omitted when this holds  , as in example (5) .

~ E\[o wever , Japanese honoiific predicate forms do not correspond to grammatical persons a  . ? ~ rigidly as the Enl " opean languages ' verb inflec ~ ien  . Tixe omitted subject of ( 4 ) and the omitted indirect t ) bjeet of ( 5 ) may be someone else worthy of respect , and the omitted subject of " ( 5 ) may be the speaker's in group member . A mechanism is needed which identifies the omitted subject of the subject-honorific predicate and the object of the object-honorific predicate with the hearer  , a ~ d the omitted subject of the object-honorific predicate with the speaker by default  , and otherwise ( when specific information is given ) identifies them with a person explicitly given in the context  ,  . 
Lexical descriptions of honorific verbs and auxil iariez must meet the condition above  . For example , the lexical description of a subject-honorific auxiliary reru is as follows  ( the feature specification depends on that for honorifics by 
Maeda et al 1988 )   ( DEFI_EX reVSTEM ( ) \[\[ HEAD \[\[ POS V \] \[ crYPE VOW ( vowel-st , ) m-type , i . e . it idan ) \]\[CFORMSTEM\]\[MODL ( modat ) \[\[ DEAC ( do act lve ) SHON ( sbj--honorific ) \]\]\]\]\[SUBCAF\[\[IIEAD\[\[POSP\]\[FORM Ra\]\[GRFSUBJ\]\]\]\[SUBCAT\]\[SEM?x\]\ ]\[\[HEAD\[\[POSVII\[CTYPE  ( : ORCONS-UVCON~-VSURU ) \]\[CFORMVONG ( vuice-negtive , i . e . tnizen , ~I ~ ei ) \]\[MODLIDEAC~\]\]\]\[SUBCAT\[\[HEAD\[\[ POSP\]\[FDRM ga\]\[GRFSUDJ\]\]\]\[SUBCAT\] \[SEM?x\]\]\]\[SEM?SE~\]\]\]\[SEM?SEM \]\[ PIRAG  ( pragmatics ) \[\[SPEAKER?SPEAKER\]\[HEARER?HEARER\]\ [ RESIRS  ( restrictions ) \[\[RELNRESPECI'\]\[AGEN?SPEAKER\]\[ OBJE?X\]\]\]\]\]\]  ( ? X = d ? SPEAKER ) ) N . B . Tile feature structure of the verbal stem of the auxiliary is given above  . Conjugation alendings are specified separately and are utilized in analyzing the auxiliary  . The CTYPE value in the SUBCAT specifics the conjugation type eI ' the subcategoriz cdV  , i . e . 
consonant-stem-type and suru 4ype ( Vs with other conjugation types are subcategorized-for by rarer u  , an allomorph of reru ) . The MODL is used to impose conditions on the possibility of mutual subcategorization between different ldnds of Vs  . In order to meet the unorderedness of Japanese case phrases  , the value of the SUBCAT feature is a set ( Gunji 1987 ) instead of an ordered list adopted in the HPSG English gramrnar  ( Pollard & Sag 1987 )  . The set is expressed by a rule reader into its cm ' responding possible ordered list descriptions  . 
The semantic value of the subject ( ? X ) is restricted by the PRAG feature ( the feature for describing the pragz natic constraint  ) to be someone being respected by the speaker . 

When it is not filled by the analy , ( ~ is depend'e;~i ~ on explicit in lbrmation , it deihult ~ to the speaker by means of "= = d " . 
This lexical description is embedded into the total zero pronoun identification mechanism by revising TSIJ : lopic Supplementation Principle  ( 2nd Version )  1 . For a C whose TOP value is a stack < tj . . . . . t in > ~ t : a ( i whose SLASH value is a set P1 . . . . . Pn , the gEM of each of P1 . . . . . Pn  is set to one of t1 . . . . . t i n , without the SEM of two Ps assigned to timst one t  , if the two are unifiable . If none of the pairs are unifiable , then the rule does not apply . 
2 . Non-specified S~\]i Y ~ values of obligato ~' y case NPs  ( if ' honorific , deictic , speech act , and mental predicates arc set to their default values  , i . e ~ to the speaker orth ~: ~ hearer . 
Description of other subject-honorific and object-honorific auxiliaries and verbs are l ikewise given  , and their zero pronouns are identified by means of TSP  . 
N . B . For object-honorific auxiliaries and verbs , empathy degree is also specified . SecSections 4 . 2 . and 5 . 
4.2. Deictic predicts re
One of the major features of spoken Japanese discourse is its frequent use of " deictic predicates  , i . e . forms of predicates which change according to the empathic relatio ~ between tb  . epersen~s involved . The most easily understood examples are go and come in English  . Besides their cmmter partsiku and huru , Japanese has at richotomous system of donatory verbs  , inc . yaru ( give ) , hureru ( give ) , and morau ( receive ) . Kurer ~ is used when the receiver is U hespeaker or his/hering roup member  ( e . g . his/herihm\[iy ) o Otherwise yarn is used ~ o express give . These for ras are also employed as a o . ~ iliarics on the same deictic condition when the action expressed by the main verb involves giving or receiving of laver  . They appear frequently in spoken Japanese dialogue as constituents of speech-act ~ related complex predicates  .  :\[ , ' or example ,   ( 6 ) ? ? hotel note haiw a site kure ru nodes u ~ a ? hotel GEN ~' eservation TOP do-REC FAVEXP !  , -POLQUP , ~ST
Could you reserve a hotel\[or me ?
As in (6) , the subject and indirect object of the auxiliary are typically the hearer slid speaker  , respectively , and when this is the case , the subject and indirect object are usually omitted ? I : :\[ owever  , like those in honorific predicates , the omii . ted subj ? ~ , ct and indirect object of deict ~ cauxiliaries have riofixed case values  . They may be son , c : in = group member of the speaker or somebody ( xther than the hearer . For example , the subject ( the person ( s ) thai = reserves ) of ( 6 ) may be the congress office exclusive of the hearer  , and its indirect object ( the personi ~ hat ~' eceives favor b : y there ~' ~ervation  )   , ay be the speaker's student .

Irrtegration of the methods Let us see how discourse  ( 7 ) with zero pronouns identifiable by either the topic or the honorific and deictic predleates are analyzed using the integrated model of TaP  .

X2 are specified ( i . e . zero pronouns are identified ) while maintaining the appropriateness of the PRAG feature structure  . There are two possibilities fbr this: ( 1 ) ? X1 is identified with the topic syssyd ( Prime Minister ) according to the first rule of TSP . 
795 (2) ? X2 is identified with syusy S . Among these , only (2) can fill both ? X1 and ? X2 . That is , if ? X2 unifies with syusy5 and ? X1 with ? SPEAKER ( this is further to be set to a global variab le * ANSWERER * at the discourse representation level  ) by the default rule deriving from the lexical description of it a daku  ( see Sections 4 . 1 and 4 . 2) . 
Here , there is nothing wrong with the PRAG features . 
On the other hand , if ( 1 ) is chosen and ? X1 is set to syusyO and ? X2 unifies with ? HEARER as default ( as is stipulated by the lexical description of i tadaku  )  , then the
PRAG has a sone of its RESTRS members\[\[RELN EMPATHY-DEGREE\]\[MORE  syusy6'\] \[ LESS?HEARER\]\] that is not unifiable with the following part of the knowledge base\[ \[RELNEMPATHY-DEGREE\]\[MORE?HEARER"\[ LESS  syusy6'\]\]   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 
because of the stipulation \[\[ RELNEMPATHY -DEGREE\]\[MORE?X\]\[LESS?Y\]\]A\[\[ RELNEM PATHY-DEGREE\]\[MORE?Y\]\[LESS?X\]\] =   1  . .
Likewise , the zero pronouns " ~ SBJ " in QI and " OSBJ " of o-ko si it a dake mase niAI are identified with the speaker  . 
The integration of the different approaches are illustrated in Figure  2  . The figure reflects the ordered relation among the three components : what intrasentential syntax cannot disambiguate is handled by the topic structure  , and then the rest goes to the predicate inibrmation component  . 
N . B . Anaphora identification ( bethzer o and explicit anaphora ) is made more effectively and widely if a model of objects appearing in the discourse with their linguistically expressed and default PRAG features is formalized  . This was partly done by Maeda et al 1988 by means of Discourse Representation Theory . 
6. Conclusion
TDS ( Topic-driven Discourse Structure) , a Japanese dialogue discourse structure that resolves zero anaphora reference  , was proposed on the basis of topic structure . 
Inlbrmation carried by predicates on honorificity , deixis , speech act and mental activities is also ut ilizedi ~ connection with TDS  . The method conforms well with the way zero anaphora actually functions in spoken Japanese discourse  . Of the zero pronouns in the inter-terminal conversation data  ,  79 . 8% were cases identifiable by this approach .
