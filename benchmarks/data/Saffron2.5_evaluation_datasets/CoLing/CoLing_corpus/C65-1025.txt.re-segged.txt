SUY ~ I~R Y . A remarkable regularity of distribution of Arabic verbal roots in the vocabulary is shown to exist  . Presented results sugsest that similar resular distributions of semantic units in other languages may be found with the help of word formation rules and vocabulary statistics  . Possible applications in approaching the problem of " true " multiple meaning in MT are being discussed  . 
The notion of " semantic unit " may be formulated in several ways/I/so that the application of this term makes its explicit definition indispensable  . It seems that difficulties in definin ~ it arise from the fact that llke most general terms it should be related to some deflnlte theory  . At present we do not possess any sufficiently strong and ~ eneral theory of the semantics of natural languages ~ though important preliminary steps in this direction have already been made  /2/  . For this reason most semantic investigations of natural languages still preserve the " art ls an llke " characters tressed by LI  . Coyoud and all definitions of the semant lonotions remain rather tentative-as well as all the more ~ eneral conclusions drawn from such investlg ~ tlons  . 
ThIs ~ too ~ holds true for the present contrlbution  , in which an empirical fact is described and some remarks on its possible applications to the problem of the " ~ rue " multiple mean ln ~ have been made  . 

Skalmowski-2
For this paper it seems advisable to hold apart two notions : that of the " concept " and that of the " semanticuz ~ it "  . 
Given a generative descrlptional device Gz ~rammar / and a pro-Jective system of the type proposed by Katz and Fodor S/sem~n-tics/we can describe a semantic concept in a lan~ua ~' eL as a set of n-tuples of symbols from G and S ~ ordered or par-tially ordered by the relations which define the formal rules of these systems ~ and having a common derivation in S  . This broad frame al ~ owsu store ~ , : ard as a oonoe ~ te ~ ery diction . . . . .  -  , ~ ~ u ~ er ~ try-except for the " grammatical words " v : hich do not i  ) ossess any de-rivations in C-and leaves us a wide mar ~ in of freede ou in - ~  , voonoelt-systems : :' , viti ~ ai , rio ~ iestab-construotin ~ arb_t , at ~' ~ lished features . 
In a similar way we may describe as ei ; mntic unit as a set of n-tuples of G-symbols , G-rules of word formation and S-symbols ~ ordered or partially ordered by means of relations wI ~ ich define the formal rules of these systems ~ and '  . . . . . .
a common derivation in ~ from some J-symool unique ! y related lj\[to some S-symbol  . This allows us to relate with ti~e not ion of a semantic unit the linguistic notions of morpheme/or merestrictly : semanteme/and of " word family " ~ defined in terms of grammat ical derivations  . 
The thessurl cai ? proach to the problem of meaning in fit/s  . e . g . 3/ pays trlbut to the idea of ordering the symbols ? c~l ^ within the conoel~ts ~ but at the same time it brings to I ~ L~t the Droblem of mult ip le meaning  .

Vaguely felt differences between the intrinsic " semantic values " of different elements of language have given rise to the notions of " size " or " content " of Semantic elements  /5/ and several attempts-both to define these notions and to furnish models of the underlying  ~  , ~ eohanism\[~avebeen , ,~ r~e / p~6/ .

It seems very probable that similar regular dis-tr ibutions might be found in other languages  , too-perhaps the ensemble of the " semantic parameters " would have to be much wider and the " trial and error " investigations would require more time but the whole work can be easily mechanised  . The idea of interconnections between the syntactic and semantic structures of language is not new in structural linguistics/s  . 9 and 10/ and investigations alon ~ these lines have already been led in the domain of computation all inguistics under direction of P  . Garvin / 11/ . My suggestions go towards discovering such regular 
Skalmowski- 7 distributions which would facilitate the task of finding more strict correlations between the synonyms within \[  ) articular concepts on computational basis . The underlying assumption is that the " universes of disoours " in various languages are of about the same " size "/ whatever it would mean-but such an assumption is tacitely made in every translation / ~ and that the semantic units underlying the components of concepts are ordered aocordin ~ to their " content " ~ so that the problem of " true " multiple meaning in certain oases  ; nay be solved by means of matching the components of concepts of the source and target languages on the basis of their ': semantic value "  .

The applied " method " be in ~ unsystematic and ad hoc the example allows no generall sations but it may illustrate our argument that the problemo f'~ue " multiple meaninzarises in cases of " expressive language " from the fact that even when the concepts of source and target languages a  ~  ; reethere is no correlation between their respective oom ~ onentse ~ oept for differences between their " value "  , based on differences on ti . eparadigmatic level .
