1 Introduction
Natural Language Engineering ( LRE , 1992) ( Smith ,  1995 ) is a more pragmatic approach to Natural Langnage Processing than traditional Computational Linguistics  . It involves seeking a largescale solution to NLP by applying engineering principles to utilise all awfilable resources  . 
q'his is in contrast to trying to scale up domain specific applications  , or by first attempting to obtain a general theory of language  . 
A core problen r for NLE is the design of the internal representation  . An ideal representation should have several features including : rich expressiveness  , readability , cI\[icient stor-age/retrieval of inf'ormation . Semantic networks have long been recognised as having the potential to \[' nl film any of these requirements  . This paper introduces two new criteria for semantic networks distribut  , edness and non-linearity and tl , argc_scalc , Object d ) as cd , Linguistic lnl , cracl , or , ~l % anslat , or and Analyser discusses their relevance to NLE . They are par-ticularty relevant in large networks where search et liciency is vital to realtime system operation  . 
The largescale NLE system I , OLITA ( Long , 1993) ( Smith ,  1995 ) has been designed and implemented Ibllowing an NLE methodology  . Its internal representation , SemNet , is a semantic network satisfying the above t % atures  . The system analyses complex text , and expresses its meaning in SemNet . '\[' his information can then be used to perform reasoning  , information retriew ~ l , or translation . Knowledge held in the network can be ex--pressed for users by generating natm ' a language @ or e SernNet  . 
The fmrdam cntal principle of Semantic Networks is that inlbrmation is stored as nodes ~ md ares  , which represent concepts and relationships respectively  . Within this framework a wide variety of networks exist  , e . g . KI , -ONE based systems ( Woods ,  1992) , SNePS/ANALOG ( All ,  1993) , and (? one eptual Graph ' Cheery ( Sowa ,  198/1) . I ) i - . 
reel comparison with these would not be justified as each has bec'n designed with different objec -tires  . I lowever , the paper does discuss aspects o\['@ese representations in order to highlight dit\[~r -cnces and why the authors believe ScmNet is a power fifl  ( with respect to search ) representation for largescale NLE . 
The rest of this paper is organised as \[' of lows  . Section 2 introduces distribnted ncss and nonlinearity as criteria \[' or judging networks amd explains their significance for NLE  . Section 3 describes the core of SemNet . Section 4 discusses the distrilmtedness and nonqinearity of SemNet and some other wellknown network representations  . 
Section 5 draws conclusions.

"  ( b ) SemNetepistemic event for " Roberto believes that every farmer owns a donkey  . " Only event nodes can have a subject , object or action . Only action nodes can be an action for an event node  . A control for each node specifies its type . E3 in Figurel ( a ) asserts that two entities ( FAP ~ MER1 and DONKEY 1 ) are in an beating relationship . The subject/object arcs ensure that it is understood that farmers beat donkeys and not vice versa  . 
A fundamental principle of the design is that concepts are not reduced to primitives  . The meaning of any node is detined in terms of its relationship with other nodes  , soultimately each node is only fully defined by the whole semantic network  . 
It shonld be noted that the event nodes can be the subject or object  , of another event so that SemNet is ' propositional ' in the sense used by  ( Kumar ,  1993) . 
3.1 Quantification
A problem for networks is to ensure that relationships refer to concepts unambiguously  ( Woods ,  1991) . For example without reference information , E3 in figure l(a ) , could mean any of : a farmer beats a donkey , all farmers beat a donkey , all farmers beat a ( the same ) donkey , or all farmers beat all donkeys . In SemNet this ambiguity is resolved by attaching the following quantification a labels to arcs : ? Universal U refers to the instances of the concept and says that all the instances of the concept are involved in relationship specified by the event  . 
? Individual I refers to the concept as a whole and says that it is involved in the relationship specified by the event  . 
alt should be noted that this paper presents a simplified account of the quantification scheme used in SemNet  . The full scheme is described in ( Short , 1996) . 
? Existential E refers to the instances of the concept  , but the instance involved depends on the particular instance of some other universally quantified concept which is involved in the event  . 
Existential arcs can be thought of as existentially quantified variables in First Order Logic  ( FOL )  , which are necessarily scoped by some universal . To represent an existential that is not scoped by a universal we use the individual ra  . nk . 
' thus for E2 in figure l(a ) , the donkey thai ; is involved depends on the farmer . This could be interpreted 4 into FO1, as : -
Beats(x , y ) ) ' lb demonstrate how SemNet can represent complex expressions  , consider the wellknown donkey sentence : " Every farmer that owns a donkey beats it  . "Of course to capture this unambiguously the meaning has to be agreed  . It is assumed that it is correctly represented by the FOL statement : - 
Alo , ky(y ) Aow . . (< y )) -+ y))
SemNet represents this as shown in figure l(a).
The event1!;2 is an ' observing ' event , it represents the assertion of the donkey sentence  ) l ' hisa ' defining ' event used to build the complex concepts  I"ARMER1   ( farmers that own ( and so beat ) donkeys ) and DONKEY 1 ( donkeys that are owned by these Nrm crs )  . For clarity the events linking hierarchies of farmers and donkeys have been written as spec  ( for specialisation )  . 
3.2 Representation of Belief and
Intensional Knowledge
It is important oem phasise that the information which is recorded within SemNet is intended to reflect the world as it is to be understood by the agent that uses the network  . No claim is made that the representation reflects the world as it really is  ( if there is such a thing )  , nor even that the representation reflects some consensus view of the way the world is  . Thus from an external viewpoint the concepts hould be interpreted as intensional  , t to we ver from the agent's viewpoint , they 4A current project is looking at providing a formal , type theoretic , semantics for SemNet ( Shiu ,  1996 )   5Note that Farmer l in the first formula above represents " farmers that own donkeys " so this formula is inferred by second  ( donkey sentence ) formula , as would be expected . 
438 constitute the world it believes in , and thus may be either extensional or intensional  . As it is cmn-bersome to repeal ; that we are dealing with the agent's belie N , this shall be taken as read in the rest of this section  . Similarly , the agent will be referred to by then at ne I , OI , ITA , as this is the only agent so far which uses Sere Ne  ,  . 
It is possible for LOLITA to believe that another agent believes some relation to hohl  . lib , : example ,  1 , OIXI'A may believe that " lober to believes that every l % rmer owns a donkey  . ", see figure l(b) .  1 ) istributedness requires that one may readigl and 1'32 independently front the other . Ac-eording to the description given sot % r , there is no difl % rence between the way 1' ; 1 is represented when I , () M'I'A believes it , and when it ; is there merely as a part of some other event which\[  , ( ) I , I'I'A believes ( of course it could I ) e both ) , q ' hnsit'1'31 is read on its own , all that wouhl be said is that some agent potentially believes in the relation it expresses  . To identify any such agent would require some form of search which would be inetficient as very often the agent will be l  , ()lJ' . l ? A , l ) istributedness ca . n be better exploited by using a control . A status control makes this distinction , it takes two va . lues : real ( when I ~ OI , I'I'A believes in the event ) , and hypothetical ( otherwise ) . 
Statements may either I ) emade about concepts or about the things concepts rel > r to  . These eases need to be distinguished , l ' or example , con--sider the three concepts " the morning star  "  , the " evening star " and " Venns " . ' Phenlorning star is the last p ( )int of light in the sky to disal ) l ) earat dawn , the evening star is L he first l ) o i , ,t of lighL in the sky to appear at dusk , and Venus is a par-tic Marplanet of the solar system  . Thus , M though they have the same extension they are different intensioually  . Since the representation ret ) resents different concepts I ) y different nodes , thereinust be a means to state that two coi , cepts reD , ; to the same objeet . '\[' his is done using an extensional synonym event to connect he concet  ) ts . The synonym event , has no e\[Dct on distributedness or nonlinearity but affects topological dist~mce and deterrninism of search adversely  . 
This price is justified as distinguishing intensional and extension M concepts is important in many situations  . For exert , pie , if one tells LOLH ? A " I need a hammer " , one does not want her to answer that she has found a hammer : " the hammer that you need "  . Such misunderstandings will occur unless the hammer is correctly understood as intensional and distinguished in the representation from extensional hammers  . This is done using a ' tensional ' control stating whether tile node has an extension in the world  , an extension in some other franle of existence , such as Agatha Christie's fictional world where tile ham-tner was the lnnr der weap on  , or an unkuow n extension . Not (' . that ' tensionality ' and belief are independent . A relation may be not only hypo-thetic M , but also inteusion M : " John believes he needs a hanlmer "  . 
a . a Features exploiting he search

If controls were written as events , they would be ant-directional , involving an unidirectional subject or object arc  , i . e . if a control rel > rs to a node . 
of the network , there need not be any information on that node baek to the control  . Suchuni-dire ( : tional events are beneficial to the ( leternt in-ism of search since they restrict the number of arcs that can be traversed from any node  . Controls represent a fltr the rimln ' Ovement on distributed-ness since they reduce the number of reqnired event nodes without Mfecting richness  . The in~formation expressed as controls is never rel~rred to by other events  . 
Controls allow defaulting , which is illegal for the network , l ) efaulting consists of assulning some fact , when no information of that fact's type is e . x pressed explicitly . This means that the infer- . 
marion expressed by some section of Sere Ne , can be unsound with re . spec to the fn\]l semanl , icnet . 
It might appear suHicient to check all the events attached to a node to determine whether a default al  ) l: ) lies , but it ; shou hlbe remembered that events can also be inherited from far Ul  ) the inheritance hierarehy . Indeed , one of the practical advantages of distributedness i that it does away with the need of inheriting all a nodes ' ancestors ' in R  ) rlna-lion while allowing the benefits of a hierarchieal knowledge base  . 
4 Distributedness and
Non-Linearity in known
Networks'l'his section 1 ) egins with a discussion of the dis-tributedness and nonlinearity of SemNet  . The latter part investigates the properties for other representations  . 
In Sere Ne , a single , )( , de ( say E , in tigure l(a )) tells ns nothing , except that some concept exists . 
Its controls will specify its type ( event , extemsional , real in this case ) , li ' , very arc attached to the node specifies 1 ~ ; 1 further : the action arc specifies its type ( an owning relation )  , the subject arc specifies that it is all the instances of I  , 'AILMI , ; I1 that participate in the owning relation in the sul > a  ( scoped ) instance of DONKEY1 which participates ill the relation in the objecl  , role . This information can be combined into the interpretation that all instances of Ii'ARME II own a  ( scoped )   ) instance of IONKI , Y 1 q ' lnlseach arc conveys an independent piece of Information which can be combined composition a\ ] ly with other information known about the node  . The interpretation assigned to a node need not be retracted when reading more information specifying it : rather it is augrnented by this additional information  . 
l , ' urther information can be obtained by reading tnore of the graph : I  , ' ARMI'2 R1 is a ' subset'6 of FARMER . If the whole of the grN ) hin figure \[ ( a ) is traversed then the donkey sentence is inferred . 
1 ) ' q is still not entirely defined : each node is only fully defined by the whole semantic network  . This 0xample illustrates the full distributedness of Seln-

To demonstrate nonlinearity consider again the highlighted section of figure l  ( a )  . Reading from IAIMLR to I ) ONI(I~Y 1 , gives : r " Entity I , ' ARMI ' JR is a % uperset ' of I , 'ARMEI1 , which is a universal subject of Eu , which has action B , ArlS , and existential object \]) () NKEY 1 . AI-i'ternatively reading fl : omI ) ONKEY 1 to FARMLR , gives : " I ) ONKEY : I is an existential object for 1'32 , which has action BLAS , and universal subject FAI / . MER1, which has ' superset ' FARM li3R " . 
Clearly both readings convey the same information and each subpart would be sound inforn-m-tion in its own right  . SemNet is therefore nonlinear . 
' i ' he remainder of this section describes some initial investigations into the distributedness and nonlinearity of other representations  . This is done not as a criticism of other networks  , bnt to test out the relevance of these new properties and ~ flso to try and show where SemNet dit Drs from other wellknown networks  . 
' Fhe'l UI lox of KL-ONE based systems ( Woods ,  1992) , ( Beierle , 1992) is Semantic Netbased , the ABox usually consists of a subset of FOL . Since these assertions are expressedms ordinary logical statements  , they must be read from left to right : there is a prescribed order for reading them so they are not nonlinear  . Similarly reading arbitrary sections of the st ~tements i unlikely to give meaningful or sound statements  , l ' or exam-pie , reading part of the donkey sentence gives : 6 The (  ; erms subset and superset are used loosely here , formally concepts are interpre ( ; ed as types and so the in ( , er pre~ation is nots ~ rie ( , lycorrect rLOMTA is of course able to generate English stal  ; ements rather than ; lm following . 
Figure 2: I , ' igure 2: rU(~T-version of'l ) on key sentence ' . 
V x VyH cat s(x,~ . j ) which is not sound with respect to ; liefull reading . '\[' hus assertions in I(I , -() NI '; are neither distributed nor nonlinear . 
CG'I'(Sowa ,  1984 ) builds complex logical as : sertions using contexts  . Figure 2 shows how the donkey sentence is represented by CGT  . This use of contexts requires the whole context to be read/traversed for any sense to be made  . For example , the innermost sub-context is interpreted as " Farmers do not Ileatl  ) on keys " . If this is re ' ~ d independently from the rest , the interpretation derived is not sound with respect to that provided by the fill l context  . ' l'hus sub-contexts are not cornbined compositionally to tbrm the full context  . 
For CG'I'the independent pieces of network must beel  , tile level of a context rather than its corn- . 
ponents . This is less distributed than SemNet , where arcs for rn the smallest independent pieces of the network  . 
Partitioned Networks ( ltendrix , 1979) have a similar notion of context , called spaces . These spaces are collections of nodes and arcs of the full network  . '\]' hey are aussociated with nodes in the network  , allowing them to be referred to . This allows the set of statements within a space to be negated  , be the objects of someone's belief , or be treated in any other proposition alway . A hierarchy of these spaces states which spaces have contents visible to which others paees  . A space , and the spaces visible from it , is called a vista . 
This leads to multiple views of a semantic net , where dift~rent vist as express possibly contradictory statements  , l ' ; ach vistais independent fl ' om the rest of the network in that the rest of the network is  invisil01e fl : omit . I lowever within a vista , spaces may be negated . Indeed , if a space is negated , the space in which the negation is made is visible from it  . As a result , the interpretation of parts of a vista is not guaranteed to be sound with respect to the vist a itself  , l ? artitioned networks thus have a low distributedness  , but provide an alternative means of limiting the amount  . of in-t brmation to be processed . Unlike distributedness however , the creation of vist as requires additional processing  .
