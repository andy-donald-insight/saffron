This paper presents a taxonomy of " matter concepts " or concepts of verbs that play roles of governors in understanding natural language and picture patterns  . For this taxonomy we associate natural language with realworld picture patterns and analyze the meanings common to them  . 
The analysis shows that matter concepts are divided into two large classes : " simple matter concepts " and " non-simple matter concepts  . " Furthermore , the latter is divided into " complex concepts " and " derivative concepts  . " About 4 , 7 00 matter concepts used in daily Japanese were actually classified according to the analysis  . As a result of the classification about 1 , 2 00 basic matter concepts which cover the concepts of realworld matter at a minimum were obtained  . This classification was applied to a translation of picture pattern sequences into natural language  . 
1 Introduction
As is generally known , the intellectual activities of human beings are very instructive in higher processing of natural language and picture patterns  , especially realworld picture patterns . There are three sides to intellectual activity : ( i ) Recognition and understanding . 
(2) Thinking und inference.
(3) Expression and ( intellectual ) action.
The system of concepts or knowledge plays an essentially important role in each activity  . The base of the system is considered to be placed on those concepts formed by direct association with the real world  , which are closely related with both syntactic and semantic structures of natural language  . The aim of this paper is to make this system clear from the linguistic viewpoint  . 

There are two linguistic approaches to the analysis of the system  . One is the understanding of the outline of the whole system and the other is the detailed analysis of a small part of the system  . Compilation of a thesaurus is considered of the former type  . Thesauruses compiled so far ,  4 , 5 however , are not sufficient for machine processing because of the following : i  . Abstraction processes of concepts As shown in Sect  .  2 . 2 , it is important to introduce abstraction processes or conceptualization processes to the system not only for its systematic analysis but also for the " under-standing ' of natural language and picture patterns  . The processes are not taken into consideration in ordinary thesauruses  . 
2. Interrelation among concepts
To know semantic interrelation among words are indispensable for natural language processing  . This information is not explicitly express-ed in ordinary thesauruses  . 
3. Criterion for classification
In machine processing it must be shown why a word is classified into such and such term  . Or-dinary thesauruses do not stress the criteria . 
Concepts of verbs are the core of the system from the linguistic viewpoint  . We classify almost all concepts of verbs in daily Japanese by association of natural language with the real world  , answering the abovementioned problems . 
As for problem i , a working hierarchy along an abstraction process is constructed in the system As for problem  2  , case frames are shown in " simple matter concept , " and connecting relations among elementary matter concepts are shown in " non-simple matter concept  . " As for problem 3 , an algorithm is introduced into the classification  . 
2 Preliminary Considerations 2 . 1 Meaning Common to Natural Language and Picture Patterns Putting aside what the meaning of a picture pattern is  , let's first discuss how it can be understood . When a picture pattern or picture pattern sequence is given  , an infinite number of static or dynamic events can generally be observed within  . Suppose that the meaning of each event is described in natural language--in fact  , one can express almost all events in natural language apart from the question of efficiency __ these descriptive sentences will amount to an infinite number  . An ordinary sentence is reduced into simple sentences  , each of which is governed syntactically and semantically by a verb  . Since there is a finite number of verbs in each language  , the meanings of an infinite number of the events involved are roughly divided into the meanings of those verbs and their interrelations  . 
Now , what is the meaning of picture patterns ? In the case of circuit diagrams or chem-cal structural formulas  , we can think of the se-127-mantics because they have signs and syntactic relations . In the case of realworld picture patterns , however , there exists neither signs nor syntactic relations  . Here we observe realworld objects named by human beings  . If we consider them something like signs , we can think of the syntax , and then the semantics , too . The meanings are common to natural language and picture patterns  , although their syntactic structures differ largely from each other  . 
2 . 2 Paradigms for Interpretation and Understand-k ~ In order to clarify the notions of interpretation and understanding  , first , we propose a working hierarchy of knowledge along the abstraction process  , as follows : Level 1 Raw data Data close to copies of
Level 2
Level 3
Level 4
Level 5
O0i
Level 5 things and events in the real world.
Image-like data.
Data of visual features Features extracted from raw data  . 
Data of conceptual features Symbolic data associated with visual features  . Some of them correspond to
Chomsky's syntactic features in the lexicon.6
Concept data Data obtained by organizing conceptual features  . Most data have names as words . In case of the verb they roughly correspond to
Minsky , s surface semantic frames.7
Interconnected concept data Networks of concept data  . A concept can be interconnected with other concepts from various viewpoints  .

Schank , sscripts can be regarded as one of this type . 8 Some networks have names as words . 
Fig . 1 shows the hierarchy . " Interpretation " is considered as an association of the data at one level with another level  .   ( Here input images are considered as level zero data  . ) Since the knowledge system has several levels and each level has many domains  , interpretation is possible in many ways . If an interpretation is performed under a certain control system that specifies which level and which domain the input data should be associated with  , it is called " understanding . " As the level number increases , a level becomes higher because abstractions of concepts proceed  . But , which is deeper , level 1 or level 5 ? In natural language understanding , input sentences will probably be interpreted initially at level  4 or 5  , then the interpretation may descend to level i , where level 1 might be deeper than either level 4 or 5  . However , if the interpretation of a picture pattern proceeds from level  1 to 5  , we think level 5 as the deeper level . 
The knowledge system is so massive and complicated that it is necessary to make systematic analyses  . Since the number of verbs are finite , concepts of verbs at level 4 provide a clue to systematic and exhaustive analyses of knowledge from the linguistic viewpoint  . 
The concepts of verbs are divided into two large classes : " simple matter concepts " and " non -simple matter concepts  . "2,33 Simple Matter Concepts

Fig . 1 Hierarchy of the knowledge system
The simple matter concepts are not reduced into any more elementary matter concepts while the non -simple ones are reduced  . Most of them are so concrete that they are well analyzed by direct association identified by a verb is called " matter  . " Unlike things matter does not occur alone . It arises accompanied by things , events , and attributes , which are call-ed " constituents , " so this concept can be regarded as the concept of a dynamic or static relation among constituents and be expressed by v  ( s , o , of , ot , om , Os , Ow , O c , p , t , r ,  .   . . . .  )   ( A ) where each symbol in parenthe`ses represents a constituent specified below  . 
s : subjective concepto:objective concept of : starting point in  ac-128 -- tion , or initial stste of changeot : finishing or target point in action  , or final state of change
Om : opponent in mutual action
Os : standard or reference
Ow : way or means ( including instrument )
Oc : concept which supplements attributive aspects p  , t , r ,   . . . . . : place , time , cause ( or reason ), .   .   .   .   . 
Out of these , eight constituents s through o care obligatory because they are indispensable for the recognition of matter  . In Japanese sentences , the obligatory constituents are often accompanied with such postpositional words as s-ga  , oo , of-kara , ot-ni , om-to , os-ni , ow-de , and oc-tO . But it is difficult to decide the case of a constituent only by such postposition-alwords  . 
The combination of obligatory constituents decides the basic frame of matter concepts  . Table 1 was obtained after an elaborate investigation of more ~ han  1  , 500 simple matter concepts . 
Two comments must be added to Table i . First , optional constituents participate fairly freely in matter  . Table 1 says nothing about this problem . Next , some obligatory constituents are not obligatory in every case  . 
M1 ( konoha-ga eda-kara ) ochiru.
( Aleaf ) falls ( from the branch).
M2 ( botan-ga shatu-kara ) to reru.
( A button ) comes off ( the shirt).
In M1 of eda ( branch ) is optional because ochiru is recognized by observing the vertical movement of a leaf  , while in M2 of shats u ( shirt ) is ob-ligatory because to reru is not recognized without the existence of a shirt  . Constituents of , ot , Ow , and ocbelong to such a group . 
3.2 Semantic Contents
In case of semantic contents it is difficult to classify them by examining the combination of constituents  , so we adopted a trial-and-error method extracting features for classification from the concepts  . Letting a set of simple matter concepts under consideration be C  , the feature extraction from ? is performed by the following recursive procedure : 
Step 1
Select several elements having similar contents from ? and extract from them a feature  ( ~ ) which makes them similar . 
Step n (> 2)
Let the features extracted up to step ( n-l ) be Cl , c2 ,  .   . . . . , Cn_ I . Extract a feature ( cn ) in the same way as step i .   ( The element so far selected may be adopted in the extraction  . ) And compare cn with each ci(l~i_<n-l ) . 
i ) If cn is independent with each ci , adopt it as a feature and go to step ( n + l) . 
2) Otherwise , 2 . 1 ) if the contents of Cn/Ci contains that of ci/Cn , adopt cn as an upper/lower-grade feature of ci and go to step  ( n + l )  . 
2 . 2) Otherwise , make cn as a special feature and go to step ( n + l )  .

There are 1 , 209 different concepts in the classified concepts . 
This method was applied to the set of concepts described in Sect  .  3 . 1 and the result is tabulated in Table 2 . He redistribution was obtained by the classification of Chapter  5  . In Table 2 , the first digit 0 ,   1 and 2 in the classification numbers roughly represent movement  , change , and state , respectively . 
1294 Non-Sim~le M~tter Concepts
Generally , non-simple matter concepts are so abstract in comparison with simple ones that it is hard to show a clear association of natural language with the real world  . We emphasize the analysis of how they are composed of simple ones  . 
4.1 Complex Concept A
If two elementary matter concepts vi and vj ( not necessarily simple ones ) are connected according to one of the rules shown in Table  3 and the connected concept is expressed by a Japanese complex word of two verbs for vi and vj  , it is called a ' ~ complex concept of A . " The rules in Table 3 were obtained from the investigation of a-bout 900 matter concepts which consist of two matter concepts and are expressed by a 
Japanese complex word.
In rule X X I . I , vj ( deru ) is an upper-grade concept of vi ( af~reru ) and contains the contents of vi . Rule X X I . I is concerned with the whole and a part of the same matter  , while rule X X I . II with two different matters . The former is considered as a special case of the latter in which two matters coincide with each other  . 
Rule XXI and X Xll are logical while rule
XXI\[I is linguistic . As " cause " is one of the constituents in ( A ) in Sect .  3 . 1, XXI may be considered as a part of XX~II . 
The semantic contents of complex concept A consists of the vi and vj contents and their connecting relation  . 
4.2 Complex Concept B
Complex concept B consists of several elementary matter concepts and is usually expressed by a Japanese simple word  . However , no general rule can be found to connect elementary matter concepts  , so a hierarchical analysis was made for a small number of complex concepts of B as shown in 
Fig . 2 and Table 4.

The relation among elementary matter concepts can not well be expressed by enumerating each verb as in the case of complex concept A  . When one is going to designate matter in the real world without the verb identifying it  , one must utter several sen-

Disi015 itences . If such necessities often arise and the relationship is conceptualized  , it will be efficient to give it a name . 
As for semantic contents , elementary matter concepts and their relationship form a surface contents  . Approximately 1 , 0 00 complex concepts of B were investigated according to the feature extraction method in Sect  .  3 . 2 and the result is tabulated in Table 5 . 
4.3 Derivative Concept
Some concepts possess a function of deriving a new concept by operating others  . Matter concepts derived from operative concepts with both morphemic structures and derivative information as shown in Table  6 and 7 respectively a recall-ed"derivative concepts . " Table 7 was obtained from the investigation of about 700 matter concepts , most of which are expressed by a complex word and one concept is operative to the other  . 
The derivative information is very similar to the modal information of auxiliary verbs  , but it differs in that some matter concepts are operat-ed upon and those operations are fixed  . 
5 Classification
In order to determine whether analyses in Chapter 3 and 4 are good or not , we classified about 4 , 700 basic matter concepts in daily Japanese , which are listed in " Word List by Semantic

The elements or members of Vx(x = T,U, . . . ) are denoted by Vxi ( i = 1, 2, . ' . ) and the sum and difference in the set theory are denoted by + and -  , respectively .

For each VT i of VT , i . i ) examine whether V Ti functions with others or by itself  . If it functions with others , then it is excluded from VT . 
Example . - ga ~ u ; 1 . 2 ) examine whether there is V Th ( h<i ) which has the same contents as V Ti and is expressed by the same verb as V ~ i  . If there is such VT h,
VT i is excluded from VT .
Let , s denote a class of concepts excluded by
I.I ) and 1.2) by Vp and let VU = VT-Vp.
2) Classification of derivative concepts
For each VU i of YU , 2 . 1) if VU i is expressed by a derivative word , it is classified as a member of term L in Table 6 . It is further classified in more detail according to Table  7  ;  2 . 2 ) if VU i is expressed by a complex word of two verbs and one of these verbs is affixal  , then it is regarded as a member of term LI in Table  6  , and classified in more detail according to Table 7  ;  2 . 3 ) if VU i is expressed by neither a derivative word nor a complex word  , but it is regard-ed as a member of one of the terms in Table  7  , it is classified into that term . At the same time , it is classified into term L ~ in Table 6 . 
Let this class of concepts thus obtained be

3 ) Classification of complex concepts of A For each VU i  ( @ V D j ) of VU , if VU i is express-ed by a complex word of two verbs and each concept functions by itself  , it is considered as a complex concept of A and classified according to 
Table 3.
The class thus obtained is denoted by VA.
4 ) Classification of complex concepts of B For each VU i  ( ~VDj , VA k ) of VU , if its contents does not belong to any term in Table  2  , it is regarded as a complex concept of B . The class thus obtained is denoted by VB and subject to the following process : 
For each VBi , 4 . 1 ) examine its surface structure and classify it according to Table i  ;  4 . 2 ) examine its surface contents and classify it according to Table  5  . 
Let V~=VD+VA+VB and Vs = Vu-V ~ .
5) Classification of similar concepts
In class VS of simple matter concepts , if there is a group with similar contents , choose a concept as the standard , then classify the re-132 -main der as similar concepts . 
Example . Korogeru ( roll ) ~ korobu ( roll) , ma-robu ( roll ) , etc . are similar concepts for standard concept korogaru  ( roll )  . 
Counter example . Saezuru ( chirp ) , hoeru ( bark ) , unaru ( roar ) , in a naku ( neigh ) , etc . are not similar concepts for standard concept naku  ( cry )  . 
Here , it is assumed that if a certain concept is a standard concept  , it is not a similar concept for another standard one at the same time  . 
The class of similar concepts thus obtained is denoted as Vs and let Vb = VS-Vs  . 
6) Classification of standard concepts
For each V bi of Vb , 6 . 1 ) examine its structural pattern and classify it according to Table i  ;  6 . 2 ) examine its semantic contents and classify it according to Table  2  . 
In the above process 2) through 6) , one concept can be classified into two or more terms if necessary  . 
5.2 Results and Discussion
First , let's discuss the relation among the obtained classes along the abstraction process  . 
There are two kinds of abstraction processes : ( i ) extracting common features from concepts as follows  ; bull dog--+ dog-~animal--~living thing--~thing ,   ( ii ) connecting several concepts to form a new concept as shown in complex concept B  . From the latter viewpoint , the relation among classes is schematized as indicated in Fig  .  5 . 
Fig . 5 Relation among obtained classes
Simple matter concepts ( Vb ) are regarded as the base of matter concepts in the sense that Vb covers the concepts of real worldmatter at a minimum and every other matter concept is led from Vb by a rule  . Two simple matter concepts are connected by a rule and form a little bit abstract concept or complex concept of A  . Sever-almatter concepts are organized by a fairly complicated rule into a new abstract concept or complex concept of B  . One of the elementary concepts in a complex concept of A changes its meaning diachronically and becomes a derivative operator  . So , the system of Japanese verb concepts has its own nature -- although it is a fact that a large part of the system is universal--and is not manipulated at one level  . 
Next , Table 8 indicates the distribution of all matter concepts  . The minute distribution in Table 8 Distribution of matter concepts

VT = VU+Vp 4 , 740 each class has been shown in Table 2 , 5 and 7 , respectively . Table 8 is instructive in investigating the human competence in organizing the language system  . For example , if class Yb is regarded as " primitive " concepts  , number 1 , 2 09 of Vb does not side with Schank's classification , 9 but with Minsky's idea . 7 From Table 2 , 5 and 7 , we can measure the degree of human concern about realworld matter  . For example , term 0 . 0 in Table 2 shows human beings are most interested in displacements of objects  . 
Finally , we consider that every matter concept under consideration was classified satisfactorily supporting our analyses  .

Fig . 6 Organization of the system 6 . 1 Knowledge System The knowledge system consists of four components  , visual , conceptual , linguistic and thesaurus . The visual component contains models of primitive pictures and syntactic rules  , which correspond to level 2 data in Fig . i . The rules are applied to picture pattern pairs called " be-fore-after " frame pairs  .   7 The conceptual component contains conceptual features  , concepts , and networks of concepts , pectively . A matter concept is expressed by \[ v:ClC2 . ' . cldl(El)d2(E2)' . .dm ( Em ) \]  ( B ) where each ci denotes a feature of matter itself and is associated with a syntactic rule mention -ed above  . Each dj (   ) denotes the case or roll of a constitnent and must be filled by a specific instance or concept of constituent  . Features Ej (= ejlej 2 . . . ejn ) specify the conditions its as-slgnment must meet . A network is constructed among similar matter concepts  . 
The linguistic component consists of dictionaries for the production of Japanese and English sentences  . The thesaurus component contains all the classified concepts in Chapter  5 and supports the development of other components . 
6.2 Translation Process
A sequence of picture patterns , or two-di-mensional line drawings ( handwriting is allowed )  , is input at time t0 , tl ,  . . . , tn . A picture pattern at t i ( 0 ~ i ~ n - l ) is paired with the one atti+l , and processed as follows : i ) Primitive picture recognition and syntactic analysis The picture pattern reader is a curve follower that traces line segments by octagonal scanning  . The recognizer is based on Evans's matching program for graph-likelined rawings but is improved to handle noisy ones  .   13 The syntactic analyzer A decomposes the complex picture  , in which two or more primitive pictures may intersector to r touch each other  , and recognizes them according to Gestalt criteria . 
The syntactic analyzer B performs Boolean operations on quantized primitive pictures to check such a relation as " MANINSIDE HOUSE  . " The syntactic analyzer C performs numerical operations on the data such as coordinates and transformational coefficients of primitive pictures  . 
2) Semantic analysis and inference
The semantic analyzer detects the meaning of matter-centred change in picture pattern pairs by topdown analysis  . Suppose that matter\[v(s,oa ): ClC2 . . . Clds(es ) do a(eo~)\] is directed by the Inference . The analyzer assigns the role of sto one of the primitive pictures  , say P s , after checking whether Ps meetses . It assigns the role of o ~ to another primitive picture Poa in the same way  . Then it analyzes each ci by calling a correspondent sub-program in the syntactic analyzer B or C  . If all the analyses end in success , the meaning of v(s , oa ) is detected , The present Inference makes inferences about all the similar concepts in the network in depth -first order  , directing each matter concept at a node to the semantic analyzer  . 
Finally , the synthesizer produces Japanese and English simple sentences  . 
6.3 Experiments
All the programs except the picture pattern reader are written in Fortran and run under the OS~/VS of the FACOM  230-38S medium scale computer at Oita University . Running with the syntactic analyzer B and C , the semantic analyzer occupies approximately 200K bytes of core . Memory usage for all the dictionaries except the thesaurus component amounts to approximately  90K bytes . 
Fig .   7 and 8 indicate an example of the recognition of a primitive picture and the translation of a picture pattern pair  , respectively . It took 47 seconds to recognize " bird\[l\]"inFig .   7 and 60 seconds to analyze and infer the meanings of matter after the recognition of primitive pictures in Fig  .  8 . 
Katz and Fodor pointed out the three problems of a semantic theory:  ( i ) Semantic ambiguity , ( ii ) Semantic anomaly , and ( i /) Paraphrase .

( b ) Output sentences
Translation of a picture pattern pair readings of the input picture pattern pair  . The output sentences in Fig .   8 shows SUPP under stands to a fair degree the change in the input  . 
As for ( ii ) the ability in detecting semantic anomaly is important  . SUPP checks it by Ejin(B ) in Sect .  6 . 1 , but a little bitanomalous sentence 5 ) or 7 ) is output because the constructed dictionary of matter concepts is slightly insufficient  . As for ( JJi ) the ability in paraphrasing sentences is needed . Output sentences 4 ) through 7 ) are an analytical paraphrase of " THEBIRD\[i\] PERCHESONTHETREE " although SUPP has no knowledge about " perch  . "  7 Conclusions A taxonomy of Japanese matter concepts has been described  . It is summarized as follows:
Simple matter concept
Standard concept fstructural pattern ; types 12~semantic contents ; 20 features
Similar concept
Non-simple matter concept
Complex concept A connecting rule 3 types semantic contents ; each contents of elements and their connecting relation 
Complex concept B connecting rule ; different in each concept surface contents ; 14 features
Derivative concept ; derivative operator ; types 3 derivative information ;   9 features This taxonomy has made clear the outline of the system of all matter concepts in daily Japanese  , and by SUPP picture pattern understanding research has come closer to natural language understanding research  . 

The author started his investigation of Japanese matter concepts and the development of SUPP some ten years a go when he was at Kyushu University  . The author wishes to express grati-tude to Pr of . T . Tamatiof Kyushu University for his kind guidance and material support  .
