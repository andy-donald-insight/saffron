We have recently completed the sixth in a series of " Message Understanding Conferences " which are designed to promote and evaluate research in information extraction  .   MUC6 introduced several innovations over prior MUCs , most notably in the range of different asks for which evaluations were conducted  . We describe some of the motivations for the new format and briefly discuss some of the results of the evaluations  . 
1 The MUC Evaluations
We have just completed the sixth in a series of Message Understanding Conferences  , which have been organized by NRAD , the RDT&E division of the Naval Command , Control and Ocean Surveillance Center ( formerly NOSC , the Naval Ocean Systems Center ) with the support of DARPA , the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency . 
This paper looks briefly at the history of these Conferences and then examines the considerations which led to the structure of  MUC6 The Message Understanding Conferences were initiated by NOSC to assess and to foster research on the automated analysis of military messages containing textual information  . Although called " conferences " , the distinguishing characteristic of the MUCs are not the conferences themselves  , but the evaluations to which participants must submit in order to be permitted to attend the conference  . For each MUC , participating roups have been given sample messages and instructions on the type of information to be extracted  , and have developed a system to proces such messages  . 
Then , shortly before the conference , participants are given a set of test messages to be run through their system  ( without making any changes to the system )  ; the output of each participant's system 1The full proceedings of the conference are to be distributed by Morgan Kaufmann Publishers  , San Mateo , California ; earlier MUC proeeedings ~ for MUC3 ,  4 , and 5 , are also available from Morgan Kaufmann .

The MUCs are remarkable in part because of the degree to which these evaluations have defined a prograin of research and development  . DARPA has a number of information science and technology programs which are driven in large part  , by regular evaluations . The MUCs are notable , however , in that they in large part have shaped the research program in information extraction and brought it to its current state  2 Early History MUC1   ( 1987 ) was basically exploratory ; each group design edits own format for recording the information in the document  , and there was no formal evaluation . By MUC-2 (1989) , the task had crystalized as one of template filling  . One receives a description of a class of events to be iden-tiffed in the text  ; for each of these events one must fill a template with information about the event  . 
The template has slots for information about the event  , such as the type of event , the agent , the time and place , the effect , etc . For MUC-2, the template had 10 slots . Both MUC1 and MUC-2 involved sanitized forms of military messages about n aval sightings and engagements  . 
The second MUC also worked out the details of the primary evaluation measures  , recall and precision . To present it in simplest terms , suppose the answer key has Nke ~ filled slots ; and that a system fills Ne or ,  . ~ t slots correctly and N in ~ or , ,~t incorrectly ( with some other slots possibly left unfilled )  . Then
Ncorrect recall-
Nkey2 There were , however , a number of individual re-scm'eh efforts in information extraction under way be-\[brethe first MUC  , including the work on information formatting of medie M narrative by Sager at New York University  ; the formatting of naval equipment failure reports by Marshatthe Naval Research Laboratory  ; and the DBG work by Logie on for RADC . 

Nco , , ; , . ect precision =
Ncorrect + N incorrect
For MUC3 (1991) , tile task shifted to reports of terrorist events ill Central and South America  , as reported in articles provided by the Foreign Broadcast Information Service  , and the template becmnesomewhat more complex ( 18 slots )  . 
This same task was used for MUC4 (1992) , with a further small increase in template complexity  ( 24 slots )  . 
MUC-5(1993) , which was conducted as part of the Tipster program  , are presented a substantial fllrther jump in task complexity  . Two tasks were involved , international joint ventures and electronic circuit fabrication  , in two hmgnages , English and Japanese . The joint venture task required 11 templates with a total of 47 slots for the output double tile number of slots defined for  MUC4 and the task documentation was over 40 pages long . 
One innovation of MUC-5 was the use of a nested template structure . In earlier MUCs , each event had been represented as a single temi ) late ? in effect , a single record in a data l ) as e , with a large nuin ber of attributes . This format proved awkward when an event had several participmlts  ( e . g . , several victims of a terrorist attack ) and one wanted to record a set of facts about each participant  . This sort of information ( : ould be ranch more easily recorded in the hierarchical structure introduced for  MUC-5  , in which there was a single template for an event  , which pointed to a list of tem I ( lates , one for each particii ) mlt in tile event ; . 43 MUC6: initial goals 1 ) ARI ) A convened a meeting of Tipster participants and government representatives in Decca > bet '  1993 to define goals and tasks to t MUC6  ) Among the goals which were identified were ? demonstrating task qn dependent component technologies of information extraction which would be immediately useflfl ? encouraging work to make information ex-tractioil systems in <  ) reportable ? encouraging work on " deeper understanding " a Tipster is a U  . S . Govermnent program of research and development in the areas of inibrmation retrieval and information extraction  . 
4In fact the MUC-5 structure wa~s much ( nor ( ; complex , because there were separate temt ) lates for products , time , activities of organizations , etc . 
' ~ The representatives of the resear ( : h community were Jim Cowie , lS ( . alph Grishman ( commit ; tee chair ) , Jerry Hobbs , Paul Jacobs , LeaSchubert , Carl Weir , and Ralph Weischedel . The government people attending wcre George Doddington  , Donna Harman , Boyan Onyshkevych , John Prangc , Bill Schultheis , and Beth Sundheim . 
Each of these can been seen in part as a reaction to the trends in the prior MUCs  . The MUC-5 tasks , in particular , had been quite complex and a great effort had been invested by the government in preparing the training and test data and by the participants in adapting their systems for these tasks  . Most participants worked on the tasks for 6 months ; a few ( the Tipster contractors ) had been at work on the tasks t br consi ( lerably longer . 
While the performance of solne systems was quite impressive  ( the best got 57% recall , 64% precision over all , with 73% recall and 74% t ) recision on the 4" ( : or (  ; " template types) , tile question naturally arose as to whether there were many apl  ) lieationst br which art investment of one or several developers over half -> year  ( or more ) could be justified . 
Furthermore , while so much effort had been expended , a large portion was specific to tire particular tasks  . It wasn't clear whether much progress was being made on the underlying technologies which would be needed for hetter understanding  . 
To address these goals , the meeting formulated an ambitious menu of tasks for  MUC6  , with the idea that individual participants could choose a subset of these tasks  . We consider the three goals in the three sections below  , and describe the tasks which were developed to address each goal  . 
4 Short-term subtasks
The first goal was to ident it ~ y , from the component technologies being developed for information extraction  , flmctions which would be of 1) ractical use , would be largely domain in det ) endent , and couhl in the near term be performed automatically with high ac  ( ' uracy . To meet this goal the con > mittce developed the " named entity " task  , which t ( asically involves identifying the names of all the people  , organizations , and geographic locations in a text . 
The final task specification , which also involved time , currency , and percentag expressions , used SGML markup to identify the names in a text . 
Figure 1 shows a sample sentence with named entity annotations  . The tag ENAMEX ( " entity name expression " ) is used for both people and organization names ; the tag NUNEX ( " numeric expression " ) is used for currency and I ) ercentages . 
5 Portability
The second goal was 1 ; of ocus on portability in the inibrmation extraction task the ability to rapidly retarget a system to extract  ; information about a different class of events . The comn fit-teefelt that it was important o demonstrate that useful extraction systems eou ht be created in a few weeks  . To meet this goal , we decided that the infbrmation extraction task for  MUC6 wouhl have to involve a relatively simple template  , more like MUC-2 than MUC-5 ; this was duhbed " mini-Puris </ ENAMEX > , president and chief executive officer of < ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION "> Ammirati&Puris</ENAMEX >  , about < ENAMEXTYPE="ORGANIZATION">McCann</ENAMEX > ~ s acquiring the agency with billings of < NUMEX  TYPE="MONEY">$400 million </ NUMEX > , but nothing has materialized .

MUC " . In keeping with ; he hierarchical template structure introduced in MUC-5  , it was envisioned ; hat the inini-MUC would have an event-level template pointing to templates representing  ; he partie it mnts in the event ( people , orgmfiza-tions , products , e . tc . ) , me ( liated perhaps by a " relational " level template . 
To further increase portability , a proposal was made to standardize the lowest -level tenlplates  ( for peoph ' , , orgaIfizations , etc . ) , since these basic ( : lasses are involved in a wide variety of actions  . In this way , MUC participants could develop code for these low -level telnplates once  , and then use them with many different types of events  . These low-level t ; emptates were named " telnplatelements " . 
As the specification finally deveh)ped , t i t ( ; rein-plate element for orgal fizations had six slots  , for the in aximal organization alne , any aliases , the type , a descriptive noun phrase , the locale ( in ostspecific location ) , and country . Slots are tilh , donly if inforlnation is explicitly given in the text  ( or , ill the ease of the country , can be in Drred

The old-style MUC information extraction task , based on a description of a particular ( : lass of events ( a " scenario " ) was called the " scenario template " task . A sample scenario template is shown in the appendix  . 
6 Measures of deep understanding
Another concern which was noted about the MUCs is that tile systenls we  . retending towards relatively shallow understanding techl fiques  ( based II rimarily on local pa . tterninatching ) , and that not enough work was being done to build up the mechanisms needed for deeper understanding  . Therefore , tile committee , with strongen-couragement front I ) AII . PA , included three MUC tasks which were intended to measure  , aspex : ts of the internal processing of an inforlnation extra  ( :-lion or hmguage understanding systen L These three tasks  , which were collectively called Se-mEwfl ( " Senmntic Ewfluation " ) were : ? Coreference : the systent would have to mark coreferential nount  ) hrases ( the initial SlmCification envisioned marking set -subsel  ; and part-whole relations , ill addition to identity relations ) ? Word sense disambiguation : for each ope . n (: lass word ( noun , verb , a , djective , adverb ) in the text , the systein would have to determine its sense using the Wordlmt clas-s I leal on  ( its " synset " , in Wordnettermii ~ ofogy ) ? Predicate-argument structure : the system wouhl have to create a tree interrelating the constituellts of the sentence  , using sonm set of graln ma . tical flnmtional relations The committee recognized that  , in seh ; etings neh internal measures , it , was in a king sortie presum I ) tion regarding the structures and decisions which an analyzer should make in understanding a doc -llmellt  . Note very one would share these pre , sump-lions , lint participants in the next MU ( J would be free 1 ; o enter the infornlation extraction evaluation and skip some or all of these internalew dua-Lions  . Language understanding technology might develop in ways very di I ii ? rent from those imagined by the committee  , and these internal evaluations might turnolltt ( ) t ) eir relevant distractions . However , froln the current perslmctive of tnost of the eolnmittec  , @ ese seen md fairly \]) asic aspects of unde , rstanding , and so an experinmntine vahlat-ing them ( and encouraging improvem ( mt in them ) 4:68 would I ) ew or l ; hwhil(~ .

expectations . The majority of sites had recall and precision over  90%  ; the highest-scoring system had a recall of 96% and a precision of 97%  . 
Although one must keep in mind the somewhat limited range of texts in the test set  ( all are from the Wall Street Journal , in particular ) , the results are excellent . A couple of these systems have been commercialized  , and several are being incorporated into government text-processing systems  . 
Given this level of performance , there is probably little point in repeating this task with the same ground rules in a future MUC  ( although there might be interest in processing monoease text and in performing comparable tasks oil a more varied corpus and for languages other than English  )  . 
The template element task , while superficially similar to named entities - ~ it is also based on identifying people and organizations ~ is significantly more difficult  . One has to identify descriptions of entities ( " a distributor of kumquats " ) as well as names . If an entity is mentioned several times , possibly using descriptions or different forms of a name  , these need to be identified together ; there should be only one template element for each entity in an article  . Consequently , the scores were appreciably lower , ranging across most systems from 65 to 75% in recall , and from 75% to 85% in precision . The top-scoring system had 75% recall , 86% precision . Systems did particularly poorly in identifying descriptions  ; the highest-scoring system had 38% recall and 51% precision for descriptions . 
There seemed general agreement that having prepared code for template elements in advance did make it easier to port a system to a new see -nario in a few weeks  . This factor , and the room that exists for improvement in performance  , suggest that including this task in a future MUC may be worthwhile  . 
The goal for scenario templates mini-MUC--was to demonstrate that effective information extraction systems could be created in a few weeks  . This too was successful . Although it is difficult to meaningfully compare results on different scenarios  , the scores obtained by most systems after a few weeks  ( 40% to 50% recall , 60% to 70% precision ) we recomparable to the best scores obtained in prior MUCs  . The highest performance over all was 47% recall and 70% precision . 
One can observe an increasing convergence of methods tbrinformation extraction  . Most of the systems participating in MUC6 employed a cascade of finite-state pattern recognizers  , with the earlier pattern sets recognizing entities  , and the later sets recognizing scenario-specific patterns  . This convergence may be one reason for tile bunching of scores for this task--most systems fell in a rather narrow range in both recall and precision  . 
The results of this MUC provide valuable positive testimony on behalf of information extra  ( > tion , but further improvement in both portability and performance is needed tbr many applications  . 
With respect oport ~ bility , custoiners would like to have systems which can be ported in at ' e wh ours  , or at most a few days , by someone with less expertise than a system developer  . How this might be tested in the context of a MUC is not entirely clear  . For one thing , most sites spent several days just studying the scenario description and annotated corpus  , in order to understand tile scenario definition , before coding began . Perhapsamic ro-MUC 9 with an even simpler template structure , is needed to push the limits of port , ability . 
Getting systems which can be custon fized by others is also at all order  , given the complexity and variety of knowledge sources needed for a typical 
MUC information extraction task.
With respect to performance , tile bunching of score suggests that many sites were able to solve a common set of " easy " problems  , but were stymied in processing messages which involved " hard " problems  . Whether this is true , and just what the hard problems are , will require more extensive analysis of the results of  MUC6  . Are the shortcomings due primarily to a lack of coverage in the basic patterns  , to a lack of background knowledge in the domain , to failures in coreference , or something else ? We . may hope that the failings are primarily in one area  , so that we may concentrate our energies there , but more likely the failings will be in many areas  , and broad improvements in extraction engines will be needed to improve performance  . 
9a term suggested by George Krupka nology was one of tlm goals of SemEval and its current survivor  , eo reference . . Much of tile energy for the current round , however , went into honing the definition of the task . Philosol ) hers of language have been arguing over reference and coreferencc for centuries  , so we should not have been surprised that it would t  ) eso hard to prepare a precise and consistent definition  . Additional work on the definition will he necessary  , and it may be necessary to narrow the task fllr -ther  . Despite these distractions , a few interesting early results were ol ) tained regarding e o reference methods ; we may hot ) e that , once the task specification settles down , the availability of coreference-aimotated corpora nd the chance for glory ill fltr-ther evaluations will ein ' our age more work in this area  .

Although we cannot explainal \] tile details of the template here  , a few highlights shouht be noted . For each executive post ; one generates a SUCCESSION_EVENT template , which contains refl ~ rences to the ORGANIZATION template for the organization ivolved  , and the IN_ANDOUT template for the activity involving that post  ( if an article describes a person leaving and a person start  ; ing the same job , there will be two
IN_AND_OUT templates) . The IN_AND_OUT template contains references to the tmnt  ) lates f l ) r the PERSON and t br the ORGANIZATI ( )N from which the person came ( if he/she is starting a new job )  . The PERSON and ORGANIZATION templates are the " temt  ) latelement " templates , which are invariant across scenarios .
