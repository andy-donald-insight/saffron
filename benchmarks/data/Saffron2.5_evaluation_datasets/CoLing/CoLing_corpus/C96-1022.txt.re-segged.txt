In many contexts , automatic analyzers cannot fully disambiguate a sentence or an utterance reliably  , but can produce ambiguous results containing the correct interpretation  . It is useful to study vatious properties of these ambiguities in the view of subsequent total or partial interactive disambiguation  . We have proposed a technique for labelling ambiguities in texts and in dialogue transcriptions  , and experiment edit on multilingual data . It has been first necessary to define formally the very notion of ambiguity relative to a representation system  , as well as associated concept such as ambiguity kernel  , ambiguity scope , ambiguity occurrence . 
Keywords : interactive disambiguation , ambiguity labelling , ambiguity occurrence , ambiguity kernel

We are interested in improving the quality of MT systems for monolinguals  , where the input can be text or speech , no revision is possible , and the controlled language approach is not usable  . In such contexts , the automatic analyzer cannot fully and reliably disambiguate a sentence or an utterance  , and the best available heuristics don't selecthe correct results often enough  . 
Complete or partial interactive disambiguation , folio-wing a best possible automatic disambiguation  , is an attractive way to raise quality and reliability  . 
To develop good strategies for interactive disambiguation  , it is useful to study vatious properties of the ambiguities unsolvable by state of the art analyzers  . 
To conduct such studies , it is necessary to gather data , that is , to perform " ambiguity labelling " on texts and transcriptions of spoken dialogues  . Our motivations and goals are explained in more detail in the first part  . As the usual notion of ambiguity is too vague for our purpose  , it is necessary to refine it . This is done in the second part , where we define formally the notion of ambiguity relative to a representation system  , as well as associated concept such as kernel , scope , occurrence and type of ambiguity . In the third part , we propose a format for ambiguity labelling , and illustrate it examples from a transcribed dialogue  . This format is independent of the exact kind of output produced by any implemented analyzer  , essentially because ambiguities are described with a view to generate human-oriented questions  . 
We have experimented our technique on various kinds of dialogues and on some texts in several languages  . In some cases , analysis results produced by automatic

It is interesting to compare the intuition of the human labeller with results actually produced : most of the time  , differences may be attributed to the fact that available analyzers don't yet match our expectations for " state of the art " analyzers  , because they produce spurious , " parasite " ambiguities , and don't yet implement all types of sure linguistic constraints  . 
1 Motivations and Goals
Interactive disambiguation technology must be developed in the context of research towards practical Interpreting Telecommunications systems as well as high-quality multitarget text translation systems  . In the case of speech translation , this is because the state of the art is such that a black box approach to spoken language analysis  ( speech recognition plus linguistic parsing ) is likely to give a correct output for no more than  50 to 60% of the utterances ( " Viterbi consistency "\[2\] ) l , while users would presumably require an overall success rate of at least  90% to be able to use such systems at all . However , the same spoken language analyzers may be able to produce sets of outputs containing the correct analysis in about  90% of the cases ( " structural consistency "\[2\] )  2  . In the remaining cases , the system would be unable to analyze the input , or no output would be correct . 
Further extralinguistic and sure disambiguation may be performed  ( 1 ) by an expert system , if the task is constrained enough ; (2) by the users ( author or speakers ) , through interactive disambiguation ; and ( 3 ) by a ( human ) expert rans lator or interpreter , accessible through the network . For example , an expert interpreter " monitoring " several bilingual conversations could solve some ambiguities from his workstation  , either because the system decides to ask him first  , or 1According to a study by Cohen & Oviatt , the combined success rate ( SR ) is bigger than the product of the individual success rates by about  10% in the middle range . 
Taking $2 = SI*S1+(1-S1)*A with A=20% , we get : SR of 1 component ( S1 ) 40% 45% 50% 55% 60% SR of combination ( S2 )  28% 31% 35% 39% 44%
S 1   65%   70%   75%   80%   85%   90%   95%   100%   $2   49%   55%   61%   68%   75%   83%   91%   100%   50~60% overall Viterbi constitency corresponds then to 65~75% individual success rate , which is optimistic . 
2 According to the preceding table , this corresponds to a structural consistency of 95% for each component , which seems impossible to achieve by strictly automatic means in practical applications involving general users  . 
119 because hesees it on his screen and steps in . In cases where users could not achieve satisfactory results by using  ( and helping ) the system , the human expert would take charge of ( partot ) the translation . 
We suppose an architecture flexible enough to allow the above three extralinguistic processes to be optio-nal  , and , in the case of interactive disambiguation , to allow users to control the amount of questions asked by the system  . Hence , some ambiguities may remain after extralinguistic disambiguation  . They should be solved by the system heuristically and " unsurely "  , by using preferences , cores or defaults . In that case , it is important that the questions asked from the users are the most crucial ones  , so that failure of the last step to select the correct interpretation does not result into o damaging translation errors  . 
The questions we want to study on " ambiguity label-led " dialogues and texts are the following : ? what kinds of ambiguities  ( unsolvable by state-of-the-art speech and text analyzers  ) are there in real data to be handled by the envisaged systems ? ? what are the possible methods of interactive disambiguation  , for each ambiguity type ? ? how can a system determine whether it is important or not for the overall communication goal to disambiguate a given ambiguity ? ? what kind of knowledge is necessary to solve a given ambiguity  , or , in other words , whom should the system ask : the user , the interpreter , or the expert system , if any ?? in a given dialogue or document , how far do solutions to ambiguities carry over . " to the end of the piece , to a limited distance , or not at all ? Ambiguity labelling should not be performed with reference to any particular analyzer  , even if a good one is available . It should be done at a less specific level , suitable for generating disambiguation dialogues understandable by non-specialists  . For example , attachment ambiguities are represented differently in the outputs of various analyzers  , but it is always possible to recognize such an ambiguity  , and to explain it by using a " skeleton " flat bracketing  . Ambiguity labelling may also be considered as part of the specification of present and future state of the art analyzers  , which means that : it should be compatible with the representation systems used by the actual or intended analyzers  . 
it should be clear and simple enough for linguists to do the labelling in a reliable way and in a reasonable amount of time  . 
Finally , our labelling should only be concerned with the final result of analysis  , not in any intermediate stage , because we want to retain only ambiguities which would remain unsolved after the complete automatic analysis process has been performed  . 
2 Representations , Ambiguities and
Associated Notions
Even if we want to label ambiguities independently of any specific analyzer  , we must have in mind a certain class of possible representation systems for analysis results  , and to be clear about what an " ambiguous representation " is and about what counts as an ambiguity  , etc . 
What is an " ambiguous representation " ? This question is not as trivial as it seems  , because it is often not clear what we exactly mean by " the " representation of an utterance  . In the case of a classical contextfree grammar G , shall we say that a representation fU is any tree T associated to Uvia G  , or that it is the set of all such trees ? Usually  , linguists say that U has several representations with reference to G  . 
But if we use fstructures with disjunctions , U will always have one ( or zero ! ) associated structure S . 
Then , we would like to say that S is ambiguous if it contains at least one disjunction  . Returning to G , we might then say that " the " representation fU is the disjunction of all trees T associated to U via G  . 
In practice , however , developers prefer to use hybrid data structures to represent utterances  . Trees decorated with various types of structures are very popular  . For speech and language processing , lattices bearing such trees are also used , which means at least 3 levels at which are presentation may be ambiguous . 
Which class of representation systems do we consider in our labelling ? First  , they must be finegrained enough to allow the intended operations  . For instance , text-to-speech requires less detail than translation  . On the other hand , it is counterproductive to make too many distinctions  . For example , what is the use of defining a system of 1000 semantic features if no system and no lexicographers may assign them to terms in an efficient and reliable way ? Second  , there is a matter of taste and consensus : although different representation systems may be formally equivalent  , researchers and developers have their preferences  . Third , the representations should be amenable to efficient computer processing  . Let us make this point more precise . 
A " computable " representation system is a representation system for which a " reasonable " parser can be developed  . 
A " reasonable " parser is a parser such as : ? its size and time complexity are tractable over the class of intended utterances  ; ? assumptions about its ultimate capabilities , especially about its disambiguation capabilities , are realistic given the state of the art . 
A representation will be said to be ambiguous if it is multiple or underspec ~ fied  . 
In all known representation systems , it is possible to define " proper representations  "  , extracted from the usual representations , and ambiguity-free . For example , if we represent " were adbooks " by the unique decorated dependency free :\[\[" We "  (   ( lex " I-Pro " )   ( cat pronoun )   ( person i )   ( number plur )  . . . ) \] " read " (   ( lex " read-V " )   ( cat verb )   ( person i )   ( number plur )   ( tense prespast \] )  . . . )\[" books "(( lex " book-N ") ( cat noun ) . . . )\]\] there would be 2 proper representations , one with ( tense pres ) , and the other with ( tense past ) . 

For defining the proper representations of a represemtation system  , it is necessary to specify which disjunctions are exclusive  , and which are inclusive . 
A representation ia formal representation system is proper if it contains no exclusive disjunction  . 
The set of proper representations asociated to a representation R  , is obtained by expanding all exclusive disjunctions of R  ( and eliminating duplicates )  . It is denote x lhem by_ProA ) er(_R ~ .   .   .   .   . 
R is multiple if IP roper ( R ) l > l . R is multiple if ( and onlzi ~ n ~ m_per . ____A prope representation Pisunders T ) ecified if it is undefined with respect os ome necessary information  . 
There are two cases : the intbrmation is specified  , but its value is unknown , or it is nfissing altogether . 
The first case often happens in the case of anaphor as:  ( ref ? )   , or in the case where some information has not been exactly computed  , e . g . ( task domain ?) , \[ decade of month ?) , but is necessary for transla-ting in at least one of tile target languages  . It is quite natural to consider this as ambiguous  . For example , an anaphoric reference should be said to be ambiguous ? if several possible referents appear in the representation  ( several prope representations )  , ? and also if the referent is simply marked as unknown  , which causes no disjunction . 
The second casenmy never occur in representations where all attributes are present in each decoration  . But , in a standard f-structure , one cannot force tile presence of an attribute , so that a necessary attribute may be missing : ( ref . 9) means the absence of attribute ref . 
1" or any \[ brmal representation system , then , we must specify what the " necessary information " is  . Contrary to what is needed for defining Proper ( R )  , this may wiry with the intended application . 
Our final definition is now simple to state.
A representation R is ambiguous if it is multiple or ~ f \] e per  ( R ) contains an underspecified P . 
We distinguish three levels of granularity.
a dialogue ( resp . a text ) can be segmented in at least two different ways into turns  ( resp . 
paragraphs ), or a turn ( rcsp . a paragraph ) can be segmented in at least two different ways into utterances  , or an utterance can be analyzed in at least two different ways  , whereby the analysis is performed in view of translation into one or several_l % ngugges in the contexto ~ i a certifing eneric task  . 
Ambiguities of segmentation i to paragraphs may occur in written texts  , if , for example , there is a separation by a < new line > character only  , without < line feed > or < paragraph > . They are much more frequent and problematic in dialogues  . We found many examples of such ambiguities in ATR 's transcriptions of Wizard of Oz interpretations dialogues  \[101  . 
Ambiguities of segmentation i to utterances are frequent  , and most annoying , as analyzers generally work utterance by utterance  , even if they can access analysis results of the preceding context  . For example : " rightI?nowI ? turn left . . . " or (\[10\], p .  50 ) : ~ OI < I ? so go back and is this number three I ? right there I?s hall I waithere for the bus ?"  . 
As far as utterance qevel ambiguities are concerned  , let us stress again that we consider only those which should be produced by a state-of-the-art analyzer constrained by the task  . For instance , " Please state your phone number " shoukl not be deemed ambiguous  , as no complete analysis should allow " state " to be a noun  , or " phone " to be a verb . That could be different in a context where " state " could be construed as a proper noun  ( " State " )  , for example in a dialogue involving the State Department  . 
There is afm therpoint . Consider the utterance : ( i ) Do you know where the international telephone services are located ? " File under lilm d fragment has an ambiguity ot ' attachment  , because it has two different " skeleton " 12\] representations : \[ international telephone \] services/international \[ telephone services \] As a title  , this sequence presents the same ambiguity . 
However , it is not enough to consider it in isolation . 
Take for example: ( 2 ) The international telephone services many countries  . 
The ambiguity has disappeared ! It is indeed frequent that an ambiguity relative to a fragment appears  , disappears and reappears as one broadens its context  . 
For example , in ( 3 ) The international telephone services many countries have established are very reliable  . 
the ambiguity has reappeared . Hence , in order to define properly what an ambiguity is , we must consider the fragment within an utterance  , and chuify the idea that the fragment is the smallest  ( within the utterance ) where the ambiguity can be observed . 
Although utterance-level ambiguities must be considered in tile context of whole utterances  , a sequence like " international telephone services " is ambiguous in the same way in utterances  ( l ) and ( 3 ) above . We call this an " ambiguity kernel " , as opposed to " ambiguity occurrence " , or " ambiguity " for short . 
it also clear that another sequence , such as " important husiness addresses " , presents the same sort of ambiguity , or " ambiguity type " in analogous contexts ( here , " ambiguity of attachment " , or " structural ambiguity ") . 
Other types concern the acceptions ( word senses ) , the functions ( syntactic or semantic ) , etc . " Ambiguity patterns " are more specific kinds of ambiguity types  , usable to trigger actions , such as t improduction of disambiguating dialogues  . 
We take it for granted that , for each considered representation system , we know how to define , R ~ reach fragment V of an utterance U having a proper representation P  , tile part of P which represents V . 
For example , given a contextfree grammar and an associated tree structure P for U  , the part of P representing a substring V of U is the smallest subtree Q containing all leaves corresponding to V  . Q is root of Q . Conversely , for each part Q of P , we suppose that we know how to define the fragment V of 
U represented by Q .
Let P be a prope representation fU . Q is a minimal underspecified part of P if it does not contain any strictly smaller underspecified part Q'  . 
-Let P be a prope representation fU and Q be a minimal underspecified part of P  . The scope of the ambiguity of underspecification exhibited by Q is the fragment V represented by Q  . 
In the case of an anaphoric element , Q will presumably correspond to one word or term V  . In the case of an indeterminacy of semantic relation  ( deep case )  , e . g . on some argument of a predicate , Q would correspond to a whole phrase V . 
IA fragment V presents an ambiguity of multiplicity n  ( n > 2 ) in an utterance U if it has n different proper representations which are part of nor more proper representations of U  . 
V is an ambiguity scope of an ambiguity if it is minimal relative to that ambiguity  . This means that any strictly smaller fragment W of U has strictly less than n associated sub -representations r  , equivalently , that at least two of the representations of V are be \] equal with respect to W  . 
In example (1) above , then , the fragment " the international telephone services "  , together with the two skeleton representations the\[international telephone \] services / the international \[ telephone services \] is not minimal  , because it and its two representations can be reduced to the subfragment " international telephone services " and its two representations  ( which are minimal )  . 
This leads us to consider that , in syntactic trees , the representation of a fragment is not necessarilya " horizontally complete " subtree  . In the case above , for example , we might have the configurations given in the figure below  . 
NP NP the international telephone services the international telephones Qr vice services international services the ~ international In the first pair  ( constituent sructures )  , " international telephone services " is represented by a complete subtree  . In the second pair ( dependency structures ) , the representing subtrees are not complete subtrees of the whole tree  . 
I An ambiguity occurrence , or simply ambiguity , A , of multiplicity n ( n > 2 ) relative to a representation system R , may be formally defined as : A = ( U , V , < P1 , P2 . . . Pm >, < Pl , P2 . . . Pn >) , where m > n and : U is a complete utterance , called the context of the ambiguity . 
V is a fragment of U , usually , but not necessarily connex , the scope of the ambiguity . 
P 1, P2 . . . Pm are all prope representations of U in R , and Pl , P2 . . . Pn are the parts of them which represent V . 
For any fragment W of U strictly contained in V , if ql , q2 . . . qn  are the parts of P l , P2 . --Pn corresponding to W , there is at least one pair_qi , qj(i ~ j ) such that qi = qj . 
This may be illustrated by the following diagram,
A P2  '  p3 _where we take the representations to be tree structures represented by triangles  . Here , P2 and P3 have the same part P2 representing V , so that m > n . 
I The an ambiguity kernel of
A = ( U , V , < PI , P2 . . . Pm >, < Pl , P2 . . . pn > ) is the scope of A and its ( proper ) representations :
K(A ) = ( V , < Pl , P2 . . Pn >) ?
In a database , it suffices to store only the kernels , and references to the kernels from the utterances . 
The ofA is the in which the differ , and type way Pi must be defined relative to each particular R  . 
If the representations are complex , the difference between two representations is defined recursively  . For example , two decorated trees may differ in their geometry or not  . If not , at least two corresponding nodes must differ in their decorations  . 
Furthe refinements can be made only with respect to the intended interpretation of the representations  . For example , anaphoric references and syntactic functions may becoded by the same kind of attribute-value pairs  , but are usually considered as different ambiguity types  . 
When we define ambiguity types , the linguistic intuition should be the main factor to consider  , because it is the basis for any disambiguation method  . 
For example , syntactic dependencies may be coded geometrically in one representation system  , and with features in another , but disambiguating questions should be the same . Finally , An ambiguity pattern is a schem ~ i wfth variables which can be instantiated to a  ( usually unbounded ) set of ambiguity kernels . 
Here is an ambiguity pattern of multiplicity 2 corresponding to the example above ( constituent sructures )   . 
NP\[xlNP\[x2x3\]\] , NP\[NP\[xIx2\]x3\] . 
We don't elaborate , as ambiguity patterns are specific to particular representation systems and analyzers  , so that they should not appear in our labelling . 
1223 Principles of Ambiguity Labelling
For lack of space , we cannot give here the contextfree grammar which defines our labelling formally  , and illustrate the underlying principles by way of examples from a dialogue transcription taken from  \[1  \] . 
The labelling begins by listing the text or the transcription of the dialogue  , thereby indicating segmentation problems with the mark "\[ I ? "  . Bracke-ted numbers are optional and correspond to the turns or paragraphs as presented in the original  . 
LABEL LEDDIALOGUE : " EMMIlOa " \[1\] A : Goodmorning conference office I1? how can I help you \[2\] AA :\[ ah\]yes good morning could you tell me please how to get from Kyoto station to your conference center  \[7\] A:/Is/OK , you'reat Kyoto station right now II7   \[8\] AA : yes \[9\] A :/ breath / and to get to the International Conference Center you can either travel by taxi bus or subway how would you like to go  \[10\] AA : I think subway sounds like the best way to me The labelling continues with the next level of granularity  , paragraphs or turns . The difference is that a turn begins with a speaker's code  . For each paragraph or turn , we then label the ambiguities of each possible utterance  . If there is an ambiguity of segmentation i paragraphs or turns  , there may be more labelled paragraphs or turns than in the source  . For example , AI1 ? BI1 ? C may give rise to A-BIIC and AIIB-C , and not to A-B-C and AIIBIIC . Which combinations are possible should be determined by the person doing the labelling  . An interruption such as \[8\] may also create a discontinuous turn ( \[7 , 9\] here ) . 
In the case of utterances , the same remarks apply . 
However , discontinuities should not appear . There are often less possible utterances than all possible combinations  . Take the example given in I1 . 3 above : OK l ? so go back and is this number three I ? right there I?s hall I waither e for the bus ? This is an AI?BI?CI?D pattern  , giving rise to 10 possible combinations . If the labeller considers only the 4 possibilities AIBIC-D , AIBICID , AIB-CID , and A-B-CID , the following 7 utterances will be labelled :
AOK
A-B-COK sogoback and is this number three right there 
Bsogoback and is this number three
BC sogoback and is this number three right there
Cright there
CD right there shall I waither e for the bus ?
D shall I waither e for the bus ?
The mark TUm ~ ( or PARAG for a text ) must be used if there is more than one utterance . /TURN is optional and should be inserted to close the list of utterances  , that is if the next paragraph contains only one utterance and does not begin with PARAG  . A format still closer to the TElgui delines may be proposed in the future  .

UTTERANCES\[2 . 1\]AA :\[ ah\]yes(2), good morning . 
\[2 . 2\] AA : Could you tell me please how to get from Kyoto station to your conference center  ( 3 ) ? The idea is to label all ambiguity occurrences , but only the ambiguity kernels not already labelled  . The end of the scope of each ambiguity occurrence is indicated in the text by a bracketed number which identifies its ambiguity kernel  . 
Each ambiguity kernel begins with its header . Then come its obligatory labels ( scope , then status , importance , and type , in any order ) , and its other labels . For example , the kernel header " ambiguity ~ I10a-2'-5 . 1" identifies kernel#2' in dialogue EMMI 10 a , noted here EMMI 10 a .  "5 . 1" is the coding of\[11\] . 
The status ( expert_system , interpreter , user ) expresses the kind of supplementary knowledge needed to reliably solve the considered ambiguity  . If " expert_system " is given , and if a disambiguation strategy decides to solve this ambiguity interactively  , it may ask : the expert system , if any ; the interpreter , if any ; or the user ( speaker ) . If " interpreter " is given , it means that an expert system of the generic task at hand could not be expected to solve the ambiguity  . 
The importance ( crucial , important , not-important , negligible ) expresses the impact of solving the ambiguity in the context of the intended task  . Then comes meaning , target language , reference , address , situation , mode ) and its value(s ) . The linguists may define more types and complete the list of values if necessary  . 
Other labels are optional . Their list will be completed in the future as more ambiguity labelling is performed  . 
As for now , they comprise the disambiguation scope ( how far does the solution of the ambiguity kernel carry over in the subsequent uterances  )  , and the multimodality ( what kind of cues could be used to help solve the ambiguity in a multimodal setting  )  . 
For lack of space , we can present only a few of the interesting examples from the same dialogue  .

The following example is like the famous one : " Time flies like a narrow "/" Linguist's examples " are often derided  , but they really appear in texts and dialogues .

Conclusion
Although many studies on ambiguities have been published  , the specific goal of studying ambiguities in the context of interactive disambiguation itext and speech translation has led us to explore new ground and to propose the concept of " ambiguity labelling "  . 
About 80 pages of dialogues gathered at ATR have been labelled : monolingual dialogues in Japanese and English  , and bilingual WOZ dialogues\[10\] . Attempts have also been made on French texts and dialogues  , and on monolingual telephone dialogues for which analysis results produced by automatic analyzers were available  . Part of these collected ambiguities have been used for experiments on interactive disambiguation  .
