A large corpus ( about 100MB of text ) was selected and examples of 750 fl'e-quently occurring verbs were tagged with their compleinent  ( : lass as defined by a large computational syntactic dictionary  , 
COMLEX Syntax . This tagging task led to the refinement of already existing classes and to the addition of classes that had previously not been defined  . 
This has resulted in the enrichment and improvement of the original COMLEX Syntax dictionary  . Tagging also provides statistical data which will allow users to select  , more common complelnents of a particular verb and ignorer are usage  . 
We discuss below some of the problems encountered in tagging and their resolution  . 
1 Introduction
COMLEX Syntax is a moderately-broad-coverage English lexicon  ( with about 38 , 000 root ; forms ) developed at New York University under contracto the Linguistic Data Consortium  ; the first version of the lexicon was delivered in May  1994  . The tagged version was delivered in August 1995 . The h ; xicon is available to members of the Linguistic Data Consortium for both research and commercial applications  . It was developed specifically for use in processing natural anguage by computer  . 
COMLEX Syntax is particularly detailed in its treatment of subeategorization  ( cotnplement structures )  . It includes 92 different subcategorization features for verbs , 14 for adjectives , and 9 for nouns . These distinguish not only the ( lifter-ent constituent structures which may appear in a complement  , but also the different control features associated with a constituent structure  . 
In order to make this dictionary useful to the entire Natural Language Processing coinmunity  , an effort was made to provide detailed yet theory neutral syntactic information  . In part , this involved using categories that are generally recognized  , i . e . norms , verbs , adjectives , prepositions , adverbs , and their corresponding phrasal expansions np , vp , adj p , pp , advp . COMLEX cites the specific : prepositions and adverbs hip repositional antiparticle phrases associated with particular verbs  . 1 As a starting point , the classes for complements and features developed by the New York University Linguistic String Project  ( LSP )   ( Fitzpatrick ,  1981) , were selected s in(x , the coverage is very broad and the classes well defined  . These classes were augmented and flnther refined by studying the coding employed by several other major lexicons used for automated language analysis  . The Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary ( OALD )   ( Hornby ,  1980) , the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English ( LDOCE )   ( Proctor ,  1978) , the verb ( : odes developed for English by Sanfilippo as part of the ACQUILEX project  ( Sanfilippo ,  1992) , and The Brandeis Verb Lexicon 2 were consulted . 
A Brandeis-like notation was adopted for COM-I , EX complement naines . The Brandeis notation is compositional , consisting of lists of elements joined by hyphens e  . g . pl-ing-sc ( preposition " about " followed by a gerund where tile matrix subject is the subject of the gerund e  . g . " helied about going ") . In adapting this notation for COMLEX , the list of complement nmnes became fixed and a separate xplic it definition of tile syntactic structure associated with each complement name was provided  . I , hrther information on these classes and definitions can be found in the Reference Manual  ( Macleod , 1993) and the COMLEX
Word Classes Manual ( Wolff ', 1995).
2 Tagging Task
We tagged 100 exmnples for each of 750 common verbs which had previously been entered in the COMLEX lexicon  . These tags , which becmnep art of the dictionary entry , contain tile location of the example and the name of the w~'rbal complement identified at that location  ( see figure 1 for a sample 1 e . g . pp : pval " to " for he went to the party ; part-np : adval " up " for he woke up the child .

In sentence (9) they bought something , in (10) they would agree on the statement , and in (11) he/she has got somettfing on . However , even though " where " is to be reconstructed in both  ( 12 ) and ( 13 ) only in ( 12 ) can it be unambiguously interpreted as being part of app  ( they were walking to somewhere )  ; in ( 13 ) " where " could be interpreted as apporan advp  ( it began there/it began at school ) so we classify it as having the class " where " ( which is not a COMLEX complement )  . 
5 Parenthet ica ls hlrther " missing " complements were found in parentheticals  . 
(14) For example , to move ( as the score
REQUIRES ) from the lowest-F-major register up to a barely audible ~ N minor in four seconds  , not skipping , at the same time , even one of the 407 fingerings , seems a feat too absurd to consider , and it is to the flautist's credit that he remain -ed silent throughout the passage  . 
(15) The ideal home , they AGREED , would be a small private house or a city apartment of four to five rooms  , just enough for a family Reconstructing a TO- INF ~ r " requires " in  ( 14 ) would not be correct since " require " needs a NP -TO-INF  ( * the score requires to move )  , but it is not clear what then p could be ( perhaps " the flautist "? the tone ? )  . We felt these cases to be different from the other cases that we have discussed above not only because of the difficulty of locating the complement but in the nature of the construction  . This construction is more similar , in fact , to COMLEX's V-SAY feature which allows a verb like " say " to occur in sentence adjunct positions without its complement  , s(16) He said , "I want to see you . "(17) " I " , he said , " want to see you . "(18) " I want ", he said , " to see you . "(19) " I want to see you , " he said . 
Therefore , we concluded that the fact that these verbs can occur without their complements ia fact about the graminar of parentheticals  . These examples , then , have been tagged as " parenthetical " and the new COMLEX feature PAREN-THETICAL has been given to the verbs which can occur in parentimtical constructions  . 
6 The " Intransitive " Question
We have encountered several types of zeroing in the corpus which occur with verbs which we would normally consider transitive  ( ~ or verbs which can be intransitive only under special circumstances  . 
For example , in isolation , " agree " may not occur intransitively unless it has a plural subject  ( COM-
LEX in trans-recip class ) . 7(20) he agreed with her . 
(21) they agreed .   ( with each other ) ~ Examples not from the corpus . 
a Note , that while ibrsome " transitive " verbs are defined only as verbs which take NP complements  , we consider verbs " transitive " that take any type of complement  , including PPs 7These examples are not from the corpus However , the data is rife with examples of intransitive '! agree " occurring with a singular sub-jeer as seen by the following examlfles  . 
(23 ) the gourmet insisted that it is done that way at the most fashionable dinners  , the girl reluctantly

(24) Why , it's all right , isn't it,
M other"7 Her woolly-minded parent AGREED " Of course , dear " , she said . " It's only that I like to know where yougo " . 
(25) " He's one hell of a decent boy.
Ilike that kid "." IAGREE , yes".
(26) . . . he hoped to persuade him to become his assistant in research for the labor novel  ; if Breasted
AGREED , they would get a car and tour the country ,  (27)  . . spoke up , " plenty of it . Let megive Papa blood " . The doctor
AGREED , but explained that it would be necessary first to check 
Fred's blood to ascertain whether or not it was of the same type  . . . 
We have est at ) lished the . class INTRANS-ELLIPSIS for these cases and since we feel that the coInplement is " underlyingly " t  ) resent ( the tagger is able . to supply the missing material ) we would like to 1 ) eable to reconstruct a coral ) l ( > inenttot-the above instances of " agree " . The rescent to betwe1) ossi/)ilities : ( A ) whe . resome one agrees with someone that-s ( in ( 23 ) she agreed\[with him/that it was done that way  \]  , sin ( 24 ) she agreed\[with her/that it was all right\] , in ( 25 ) I agree\[with you/with that/that he is a decent boy \]  )  ;   ( B ) a to q n f i n i t i v e ( in ( 26 ) if heagreed\[to become his assistant \] , in ( 27 ) he agreed ( to let him/her give him blood\] )  . 
Even though this last example ( 27 ) I ) resents some difli ( ' ultics in re ( : onstruction ( 1 ) because i to ( : cursoutside the senten ( : e containing the verb and ( 2 ) beemlse there is a ( : hange of mood fl : omim perative to inliiitival , we can mMer stand that the doctor agreed to let \[ hint \] give blood and reconstruct a subject controlled to-infinitive  . The
COMLEX tag entry is ( INTRANS-ELLIPSIS : ELLIP ( to-inf-sc )   ) lntrans-ellii ) s is i then alne , of the ( : lass and what is elided ( : ellp ) is a subject e ontrol h , d to infinitive ( to-inf-sc , a COMLEXeoln plelnent ) . The others ( sente Imes 2325) were tagged , arbitrarily , as having a prepositional phrase containing thel ) reposi-tion " with " and they will be entered in the dieto-nary with the tag INTRANS-EI~MPSIS : ELLII  ) al S There is M so th (  ; reading steagreed to do it ; that w&y " ( pp:pval("with ")) . The new COMLEX complement INTRANS-ELLIPSIS is added to verbs of this type and therefore COMLEX differentiates between " true " intransitives  9 and eases like the above . 
W ~ also found occurrences of " hat ) itual " in tran-sit ; ives in the text . Even verbs which are always considered to be transitive  , like " hit " for example , can be used intransitively if the action is considered to be habitual  . 10(28) That child always hits . 
(29) She always abbreviates , a very annoying habit . 
(30) He nagged constantly.
We tagged these\[INTRANS-HABITUAL \].~1
Since it seems that this ix really a grammatical question  , as any verb ( it would seem ) may occur an ahabitual intransitive , it has not been proposed as a COMLEX comph ; inent . 
7 New Noun Phrase Complement,

During ore : tagging , we tound that her ( ; are a group of noun phrases that t ) attern with adverbs and prepositional phrases , which we have called NADVI"s ( Noun Adverbial Phrases )  . These arc divided into NADVP-TIME , NAD VP-DIR,
NP-NAD VP-LOC and NAD VP-MANNER . () fleathese expressions are adjuncts , but in the following examples , they are comt ) lelnents since they are . 
required to t ) roduce a grammatical sentence . (The examples in this section are not from the corpus but similar examt  ) les were fo ( md ) The meeting took 3 hours . \[ n advp-time \]* The meeting took . 
He headed home ~ east ~ that way . \[ nadvp-dir \]* He headed . 
He put the stakes every five feet.
\[ np-nadvp-loc\]*He put the stakes.
He put it that way . \[ np-nadvp-manner \]* He put it . 
These noun phrases may be substituted tbr by adverbs or prepositional phrases  . 
The meeting took 3 hours .\[ nadvp-time \]
The meeting took long .\[ advp\]
He headed home/east/that way .\[ nadvp-dir \]
He headed to the store . \[pp\]tieput the stakes every five feet .

In general these verbs do not take regular npcom -plenlents  , at least not with the same meaning . 
The meeting took/lasted 3 hours.
He took /* lasted the car.
He headed/went home.
He headed /* went the cow down the road.
* He put the stakes the table.
* He put it the interest.
8 NUNITP : to Tag or not to Tag
Another ( : lass of nount ) hrases caused us greats oul searching . A number of verbs take very particular noun phrases  . Verbs like " increase " , " decrease " and " expand " take complement groups which require a noun with the subclass NUNIT  . ~2 These verbs occurred t ) redo Ininately in environments like The price in c reased  5 to : tO percent . 
The price increased 5 dollars a share.
We decided not to make this a separate NP coni -plement for several reasons :  ( 1 ) these verl ) s also take regular NP complements , though in some instances ( as in the below example ) the meaning of the verb chang c . s . As COMLEX does not sense disambiguate the semantic difference does not af ~ feet the dictionary entry  . 
" Those vitamins increased his appetite . "  ( 2 ) the NUNITPs are not syntacticly distinguished ; other nouns occur with similar structures . 
" Heate5 to : tO pickles ( aday )."
On the other hand , the increase-type vrbs can appear with a whole range of n unit pcomt  ) lements ( cornpleinents which contain an nun it p 1at : The price increased ( 5Z ) to $10 ( a share )   . 
The price increased ( SY , ) from $10 ( a share ) . 
The price increased from $10 ( a share ) to $ 30 ( a share )   . 
The price increased to 30 dollars from i0 dollars.
The price increased by 5Z to end at $ i00.
whereas verbs like " eat " can not * Heat eto/f rom  10 pickles . 
* Heate by 10 ~ to 20 pickles ( a day).
M though we decided not to add NUNITP as a separate NP complement  , we have let the NUNITP tags for verb complements remain  , to reflect the information that in our corpus this type t ~ The seart '  . nouns which can appear in quantifier phrases including a scalar adjectiw ~ before another noun  o1 as a head noun to llowed by a prel ) ositional phrase containing a scalar mmn ( a two FOOT long board/aboard two FEET in length )  . 
la Then unit p is S/dollars in the examples of verb occurs almost exclusively with this type of NP  . W c have added a separate frame group with the name NUNITP-TO-IANGE which includes the conq  ) leinents mentioned a bow ~' . Although , it is called NUNITP to underline the fact that ordinarily the nouns that occur are NUNITs or at '  ( ' . 
coerced into being NUNITs in this structure ~4 , the . 
NPs are not formally distinguished as such in the notation of the fl'ame group  . The fact ( hal ; these noun phrases , and the NAD VPs above , behave in a manner distinct Dom other NPs is recognized and discussed in Ross's paper on Defective Noun 
Phrases ( Ross ,  1995 )   9 Tagging Improves COMLEX Asidefl ' ompresenting these interesting and llil-expected phenomena  , tagging has tightened ut ) the classification of some coml ) lements , leading in the direction of combining some complements ghat had been separate and regrouping others  . COMLGX had a frame-group which classi-fie < l together a number of wh-comt  ) lements . Now there is a different grouping with the original " whether "/" if "/" what "  ( WIt-Scomt ) lement ) and " how " ( HOW-S , PI'-HOW-TO-INF ) augmented by " where "/" when "/" how much "/" how Inany "  ( WHERE-WHEN-S )  . This last ; group wasestM > lished for verbs like " define " and " forecast " which do not take members of the original fi'ame groups  . 
" Last year , the Supreme Court DEFINED when companies , such as military contractors , may defend themselves . "* The Supreme Court defined if companies may defend themselves  . 
"P tolemy's problem is to FORECAST where , against the inverted bowl of night , some particular light will be found at future times  . "* The problemist of ore cast how to find the light  .

All in all , our tagging has been interesting and informative . We have acquired not only statistical data on the occurrence of coln ple-ments in texts but information on possible gaps in COMLEX's syntactic overage which we moved to rectify  , when it seemed justified , and we have a record in our tagge data of those instances which we  . did not add to C()MM';X classes .
