1 ABSTRACT
We have developed an automatic abstr~mt generation system for Japanese expository writings based on rhetorical structur extraction  . The system first extracts the rhetorical structure  , the compound of the rhetorical relations between sentences  , and then cuts outless important parts in the extracted structure to generate an abstract of the desired length  . 
Evaluation of the generated abstract showed that it contains at maximum  74% of the most important sentences of the original text  . The system is now utilized as a text browser for a prototypica I interactive document retrieval system  . 
2 INTRODUCTION
Abstract generation is , like Machine Translation , one of the ultimate goal of Natural Language Processing  . I Iowever , since conventional word-frequency-based abstract generation systems  ( e . g . \[ Kuhn58\] ) are lacking in intersentential or discourse -structural analysis  , they a reliable to generate incoherent abstracts . On the other hand , conventional knowledge or script-based abstract generation systems  ( e . g . 
\[ behnert 801 , \[Fum86\]) , owe their success to the li , n-itation of the domain , and cannot be applied to document with varied subjects  , such , as popular scientific magazine . To realize a domain-independent abstract generation system  , a computational theory for analyzing linguistic discourse structure and its practical procedure must be established  . 
ltobbs developed a theory in which lie arranged three kinds of relationships between sentences from the text coherency viewpoint \[ Hobbs  79\]  . 
Grosz and Sidner proposed a theory which accounted for interactions between three notions on discourse : linguistic structure  , intention , and attention \[ C , rosz et al86\] . 
l , it man and Allen described a model in which a discourse structure of conversation was built by recognizing a participan Usplans\[Litman et al  87\]  . 
' l ' hese theories all depend on extralinguistic knowledge  , the accumulation of which presents a problem in the realization of a practical analyzer  . 
Cohen proposed a framework for analyzing the structure of argumentative discourse \[ Cohen  87\]  , yet did not provkle a concrete identification procedure for ' evidence ' relationships between sentences  , where no linguistic clues indicate the relationships  . Also , since only relationships between successive sentences were considered  , the scope which the relationships cover cannot be analyzed  , even if explicit connectives are detected . 
Mama and Thompson proposed a linguistic structure of text describing relationships between sentences and their relative importance \[ Mann et al  87\]  . 
l lowever , no method for extracting the relationships from superficial linguistic expressions was described in their paper  . 
We have developed a computational r node l of discourse for Japanese x pository writings  , and implemented a practical procedure for extracting discourse structure \[ Sumita  92\]  . In our model , discourse structure is deiined , as the rhetorical structure , i . e . , the compound of rhetorical relations between sentences in text  . Abstr~t generation is realized~s as uit a Me application of the extracted rhetorical structure  . In this paper we describe briefly our discourse model and discuss the abstract generation system based on it  . 
3443 RHETORICAl,STRUCTURE
Rhetorical structure represents relations between var-ions chunks of sentences in the body of each section  . 
In this paper , the rhetorical structure is represented by two layers : intra-paragraph and inter-paragral  ) h structures . An intra-paragraph structure is a structure whose representation uits are sentences  , and an inter-paragraph structure is a structure whose representation units are paragraphs  . 
In text , various rhetorical patterns art, . used to clarify the principle of argument . Among them , co , > nectiv c expressions , which state intersentence rla-tionships , are the most significant . Thetyl ) ie algrant-matical categories of the connective x pressions are connectives and sentence predicates  . They can I>c divided into the thirty four categories which are ex-ernplified in Table  1  . 
Table h Example Of rhetorical relations
Relation Expressions serial ( < SR > ) su'nl narizatiou ( < su > ) negative ( < NG > ) dak ' ara ( thus ) ' kh . a . , a Ok . , ,   ( after all ) shikashi ( I ) ut ) example < EG > ) tatoeba ( for example ) espeeial ( < ES > ) tokuni ( particuli ~ rly ) re . ~ son ! < aS >) , mzenara ( because ) sipplcment ( < SP > ) background ( < BI > ) parallel ( < PA > ) exteflsion ( < EX > ) rei ) hra ~ e ( < RF > ) direction ( < DI > ) mochiron ( of course ) juurai ( hither to ) mata . ( and ) korewa ( this is ) tsumari ( that is to say ) k ' oko de wa .   .   . wo no be T ~ l(here . .  . is described ) The rhetorical relation of a sentence , which is the relationship to the preceding part of the text  . , can be extracted in accordance with the connective expression in the sentence  . For a sentence without any explicit connective xl ) ressions , extension relation is set to the sentence . The relations exemplitied in Table 1 are used for representing the rhetorical structure  . 
Fig . 1 shows a paragral ) h from an article titled " A Zero-Crossing late Which Estimates the Frequency of a Speech Signal  , " where underlined words indicate connective xl ) ressions . Although the fourth and fifth sentences are clearly the exemplification of the first three sentences  , the six this not . Also the sixth sentence is the concluding sentence for the first five  . Thus , tile rhetorical structure for this text can be represented by a binary-tree as shown in Fig  .  2 . This structure is also represented as follows : \ [   \[\[1 < EZ > 2\] < gs > \[3 < E ( \]>  \[4 < EX > 5\] \]\] < sa > 6\]   1: Intile context of discrete-time signals , zero-crossing is said to occur if successive samples have dilfereut algebraic signs  . 
2: Tile rate at which zero crossings occur is a simple measure of tile frequency content of st sig  , ml . 
3: This is . particularly true of narrow b and signals . 
4: For example , as i , m so idal signal of frequency P0 , sanll)le data rate fs , h , ' ~ si'~/t "~ samples percycle of the siue wave . 
5: Each cycle has two zero crossings o that the hmg-term average rate of zero-crossings is z =  2F0/s   ;   ;   . 
6: Thus , tile average zero-crossing rate gives a reasonable way to estinmt e the frequency of a sine wave  .

Figure 2: Rhetorical structure for the text in l , 'ig . 1 The rhetorical structure is represented by a binary tree on the analogy of a syntactic tree of a natural language sentence  . Each subtree of the rhetorical structure forms an arg  , rnentative constituent , just as each subtree of tile syntactic tree forms agram  , nat-ical constituent . Also , a subtree of the rhetorical structure is sub -categorlzed by a relation of its parent node as well as a syntactic tree  .

3 46 that case the system cuts outterminal nodes from the last sentences  , which are given the same penalty score . 
If the text is written loosely , tile rhetorical structure generally contains many Both Nuelevs relations  ( e . g . , parallel(marc(and , also )) , and the system cannot gradate the penalties and cannot reduce sentence smoothly  . 
After sentences of each paragraph are reduced , inter-paragraph structure reduction is carried out in the same way based on the relative importance ju ~ lge-ment on the inter-paragraphr etorical structure  . 
If the penalty calculation mentioned above is accomplished for the rhetorical structure shown in Fig  .  2 , each penalty score is calculated as shown ill Fig  .  3 . In Fig .   3 italic numbers are the penalties the system imposed on each node of tile structure  , and broken lines are the boundary between the nodes in t--posed different penalty scores  . The figure shows that sentence four and five have penalty score three  , that sentence three has two , that sentence one and two have one , and that sentence six has no penalty score . 
In this ease , the system selects sentence one , two , three and six for the longest abstract , and and also could select sentence one , two and six as a shorter abstract , and also could select sentence six as a still more shorter abstract  . 
After the sentences to be included in tile al ) -stract are determined , the system alter , at clyar ranges the sentences and the connectives from which the relations were extracted  , and realizes the text of tile abstr~t . 
The important feature of the generated abstr , ' mts is that since they are composed of the rhetoriealy consistent units which consist of several sentences and form a rhetorical substructure  , the abstract does not contain fragmentary sentences which can  , ot be understood alone . For example , in the abstract generation mentioned above , seutence two does not al>pear solely in the abstract  , but appears ahvays with sentence one . If sentence two a pl ) eared alone in the abstract with ont sentence one , it wouhl be difficult to understand the text . 
6 EVALUATION
The generated abstracts were evaluated from the point of view of key sentence coverage  . 30 editorial articles of " As a hiShinbun " , a Japanese newspaper , and 42 technical papers of " Toshiba Review " , a journal of Toshiba Corp . which publishes hort expository papers of three or four pages  , were selected and three subjects judged tile key sentences and tile most important key sentence of each text  .

Figure 3: Penalties on relative iml ) ortance for the rhetorical structure in Fig . 2 rial articles , The average correspondence rates of the keysente . ce and tile most important key sentence among the subjects were  60% and 60% respectively . 
As for the technicall ) apcrs , they were 60% and 80% resl ) ectlvely . 
Then tile abstracts were generated and were compared with the selected key sentences  . The re-s,lt is shown in Table 3 . As for the technical papers , tile average length ratio ( abstract/original ) w ; ~s 24% , and tile coverage of tl , e key sentence and the most important key sentence were  51% and 74% respectively . Whereas , ~s for the editorials , tile average length ratio ( abstract/original ) was 30% , and the coverage of the key sentence and the most important key sentence were  41% and 60% respectively . 
The reason why the compression rate and the kc . y sentence coverage of the technical papers were higher than that of the editorials is considered as follows  . The technical papers contain so many rhetorical expressions in general as to be expository  . 

That is , they provide many linguistic clues and the system can extract the rhetorical structure exactly  . 
Accordingly , the structure can be reduced further and the length of the abstract gets shorter  , without omitting key sentences . On the other hand , in the editorials most of the relations between sentences are supposed to be understood semantically  , and are not expressed rhetorically . Therefore , they lack linguistic clues and the system cannot extract herhetorical structure x actly  .

The rhetorical structure provkles a natural order of importance amongsenteuces in the text  , and can be used to determine which sentence should be extracted in the abstract  , according to the desired length of the abstract . The rhetorical structure also provkles the rhetorical relation between the extracted sentences  , and can be used to generate appropriate connectives between them  . 
Abstract generation b~sed on rhetorical structure extraction has four merits  . First , unlike conventional word-frequency-based abstract generation systems  ( e . g . \[ Kuhn58\]) , the geuerated abstract is consistent with the original text in that the connectives between sentences in the abstract reflect their relation in the original text  . Second , once the rhetorical structure is obtained , varions lengths of generated abstracts can be generated easily  . This can be done by simply repeating the reduction process until one gets the desired length of abstract  . Third , unlike conventional knowledge or script-b`ased abstr  , ~t generation systems ( e . g . \[ Lehnert 80\] , \[Fum86\]) , the rhetorical structure extraction does not need prepared knowledge or scripts related to the original text  , aud can be used for texts of any domain , so long as they contain enonghrhetoric M expressions to be expository writings  . Fourth , the generated abstract is composed of rhetoriealy consistent units which consist of several sentences and form a rhetorical substructure  , so the abstract does not contain fragmentary sentences which cannot be understood alone  . 
The limitations of the system are mainly due to errors in the rhetorical structure analysis and the sentence-selection-type abstract generation  , the eval-nation of the accuracy of the rhetorical structure analysis carried out previously  ( \[Sumita92\] ) showed 74% . Also , to make the length of the abstract shorter , It , is necessary to utilize an inner-sentence analysis and to realize a phrase-selection-type abstract generation b  , ~sedonit . The anaphora-resolution ad the top lc-sul ) l ) leineutation must also be realized in the analysis . 
The system is now utilized , as a text browser for a prototypical interactive document retrieval system  .
