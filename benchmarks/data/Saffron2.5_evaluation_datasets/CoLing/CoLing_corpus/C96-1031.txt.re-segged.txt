This paper presents a gratmnar and style checker demonstrator for Spanish and Greek native writers developed within the project Gram Check  . 
Besides a brief grmn mar error typology for Spanish  , a linguistically motivated approach to detection and diagnosis is presented  , based on the generalized use of PROLOG extensions to highly typed unification-based grammars  . The demonstrator , currently including flfll coverage for agreement errors and certain head-argmnent relation issues  , also provides correction by means of an analysis -transfer-synthesis cycle  . 
Finally , fltture extensions to the ( : urrent system are discussed . 
1 Introduction
Grammar checking stelnmed as a logical application from forlner at teln i  ) ts to natural language . 
ulMerstanding by comtmters . Many of the NLU systems developed in the 70's indu ( le ( la kind of error recovery In echanisln ranging flom the treatment only of spelling e  . rrors , PARRY (1) ark in-sonc'tal . , 1977) , to tile inclusion also of incomplete in t ) ut containing some kind of ellipsis , LAD-
DEll ,/ LIF Ell ( Hendrix et al , 1977).
The interest in the 80's begun to turn considering grammar checking as an enterprise of its own right  ( Carbonell & Hayes ,  1983) , (Ilayes & Mouradian ,  1981) , ( Heidorn et al ,  1982) ,  ( . lensen at al . , 1983) , though many of the approaches were still in I ; t1 (: NLU tradition((\] harn iak , 198a ) , ( Granger ,  1983) , ( Kwasny & Sondheimer ,  1981) , ( Weischedel & Black ,  \]980) , ( Weisehedel & Sond-heimer ,  1983) . A1985 Ovum report on nal ; ll-rallanguage applications ( . lohns on ,  1985 ) already identifies grammar and style checking as one of the seven major apt  ) lications of NLP . Currently , every project in grammar checking has as its goal the creation of a writing aid rather than a robust man-machine interface  ( Adriaens ,  1994) , (lloliolictal . , 1992), ( Vosse , 1992) . 
Current systems dealillg with grammatical deviance have be  ( minainly involve ( t in the integi ~> don of special techniques to detect and correct  , when possible , these , deviances . In some case . s , these have be . en incorporated to traditional parsing techniques , as it is the case with feature relaxation in the context of unification-based formalisms  ( Bolioli et al ,  1992) , or the addition of a set of catching error rules si  ) ecially handling the deviant constructions ( Thurlnair ,  1990) . In other eases , the relaxation component hasheen included as a new add-in feature to the parsing algoril  , hm , as in the IBM's PLNLI'aI ) proach ( Heidorn et al ,  1982) , or in the work developed for tim Tra . nsla-tor's Workbencht ) roject using the METALMT system ( TWB ,  1992) . 
Besides , an increasing concern in current projects is that of linguistic relevance of the analysis t  ) erformed by the grammar correction system . 
In this sense , the adequate integration of error detection and correction techniques within mainstream grammm " formalisms hasl  ) een addressed by an unl ) er of these projects ( \ [ Iolioli et a/ . , 1992), ( Vosse , 1992), ((\] enthia . lctal . , t992), ( O(~uthial et al . , 1994) . 
l ~ bllowing this concern , this paper presents re-suits fl'om the project Gram Check  ( A Grammar and Style Checker , MLAP93-11) , flm ded by the CEC . Gram Check has developed a grammar checker demonstrator for Spanish and Greek native writers using ALEP  ( ET6/1 ,  1991) , ( Simp-kins , 1994) as the NLP development platform , a client-server architee Ulreas implenmnted in the X Windows system  , Motif as the ' look ~ md fe , el ' interface and Xminfo as the kllow h!dget ) as e , storage format . Generalized use of extensions to the highly typed and unifi  ( :ation based formalismim-i ) I emented in ALEP has been 1 ) erformed . These extensions ( called Constraint Solvers , CSs ) are nothing but pieces of PR ( ) I , OG codel ) erforlning different l ) oolean and relational operations over feature wdues  . Besides , Gram Check has used ongoing results Dora LS-GRAM ( LRE6 1029 )  , a project a lining at the implementation of middle pean languages  . 
The demonstrator checks whether a document contains grammar errors or style weaknesses and  , if found any , users are provided with messages , suggestions and , for grammar errors only , auto-inatic correction(s ) . 
2 Brief grammar error typology for Spanish The linguistic statements made by developers of current grammar checkers based on NLP ted > niques are often contradictory egarding the types of errors that grammar checkers must correct automatically  . ( Veronis ,  1988 ) claims that native writers are unlikely to produce errors involving morphological features  , while ( Vosse , 1992) a c-ce . t ) t such morphosyntactic errors , in spite of tile fact that an examination of texts by the author revealed that their appearance in native writer's texts is not frequent  . Both authors agree in characterizing morphosyntactic errors as a sain ple of lack of competence  . 
On the other hand , an examination of real texts produced by Spanish writers revealed that they do produce morphosyntactic errors I  . Spanish is an inflectiol m language , which increases the possibilities of such exrors . Nevertheless , other errors related to structural configuration of the language ark : produced as well  . 
Errors found fall into one of the following subtypes  , assuming that featurization is the technique used in t  ) arsing sentences : 1 . Misl natching of features that do It ( it affect representational issues ( intra - or inter-syntactic agreement on gender , number , person and cask ' for categories showing this phenonm non  )  . These mismatchings producer to ~? , - St'l " ttct~K/'ttle7"l'O ~' S . 
2 . Mismatching offl : atures which describe certain representational properties for categories  , as wrong head-argument relations , word order and substitution of certain categories  . These mismatchings produce structural errors . 
Table 1 shows rite percentages of difl hrentypes of errors tbund in the corpus  . Punctuation errors must be considered as structural violations  , while for style weaknesses , it depends on its subtype . 
Errors at the lexical level are diflh : ult to class it ~ y and it ios  (  ; of them must regaMed as spelling rather than graln l nar errors  . Then ulnl ) er of erro Is iden-tiffed in this corpus is 543  . These statisti ( :s couhl1 The corims used contains nearly 7 ( I , 0 00 words including text fragments from literature , newspal ) (: rs , technical and administradw : documentation .

A presupposition adopted in the project led to the idea that violations at the feat m'e level can be capl : ured by means of the relaxation of the possibly violated features while violations at  (  ; he level of configuration may not be relaxed withou  (  ; raising unpredictable parsing results , thus being candidates for the implementation of explicit rules encoding such incorrect structures  . 
Under this view , a comprehensive graln lnar checker must make use of both strategies  , called in the literature feature or constraint relaxation and error anticipation  , respectively . 
However , given the relevance of features ill the encoding of linguistic information in TFSs  , SOIIlOstrll cttlral errors (; ailt ) ere . analyzed as a grcelilent errors in a wide sense ( as featurenfisma . tching violal ; ions rather than structural ones ) .

Finally , for cases where equal scores are obtained , as it happens with a non-inherent masculine noun and a fen > i nine determiner  , both possible correction should be pertbrmed , since there is not enough information so as to decide the correct value  ( unless this can be obtained from other agreeing elements in the sentence -- for instance an attribute to this 

Basically , the final operation to be performed with the scores is to determine that the higher the score of an element these verer its substitution  . 
Thus , scores are clues for the correction of those elements having the lowest scores  . 
The initialization steps in order to perform the heuristic technique are related to the assignment of values and scores to lexical projections depending on its inherentness  . The values for gender and number of the head of the projection serve as a parameter for the computation of values and scores for the possible modifier which could appear closed to it  . Note that ; agreement in Spanish is based on a binary value system  . Thus , the computation of values for the modifier of a given head simply relies on the instantiation of opposite values to those of the head  . In the case of underspecification of the head for gender  , for instance , the presupposition is that this value is the same as the one of the modifier  , if this is not underspecified . Otherwise , both elements remain underspecified . Besides , the weight given to controlling elements ( 50 ) ensures that there is no way for modifiers to over pass this score  . Note as well that the weight given to inherentless values  , as number (10) , ensures that there are no promoted elements in this calculation  . The following schematic CS illustrates the assignment of scores : and  ( = ( Score'number'head , 10) , and ( or ( and (: ( lnherm~t~ess'head , yes ) , = ( Score'gender'head , 50)) , ~ u~d(=(lnherel~tness'head , no ) , ( Score'gender'head ,  10))) , = ( Score'ntmlher ' mod , 0 ) ) ) The following steps to be performed by CSs are related to the addition of all those scores associated to a given value in the successive rules building the nominal prbjection and the percolation of morphosyntaetic features : or  ( and ( or (  :  (   ( lender'head'mother , O end cr ' mod) , --( Gendcr ' mod , mase'fem )) , and ( num ' add ( MG\]gN'SCOI , tF , ' HI , \] AD , 
MGEN'SCORE'MOI),
M(~EN'SCORE'MOTIIP , I ) , and (= ( Gender ' mod'head , ( lender'mod'mother) , hum ' add ( It ( IEN'SCOl/ , \]' Y11 EAD ,

HGEN'SOORE'MOTIIER) , and (= ( Gender ' mod'head , Gend cr ' mod ' moth cr) , num'add(MGEN'SCORE'HEAD , 
HGEN'SCOR , I~'MOD,

The final evahlation performed by CSs is done when categorie showing agreement over-pass their maximal projection  , only if no other inter-syntagmatic agreement must be taken into account  ( as it is the case with subject-attribute agreement  , for instance ) . Postponing in this way the final ewfluation ensures that the CS will take into account all the previous parameters to give an appropriate diagnosis about the complete XP containing the agreement violation  . This evaluation is based on the comparison of scores by means of the ' greater than ' predicate in order to determine  ( a ) the correct w flue for the feature ( s ) checked corresponding to the highest score ( s )   ( Right_Gender , Right_Number in the example below ) , to be used by the transfer module , and ( b ) the error diagnosis ( gender , number and gender_number below ) , to be used by the error handling module that will display appropriater-ror information to the user : or  ( or ( and ( mun'gt ( I 1 ( IEN'SCO1/ . 1,'"NOl\]N,M('I,;NN(\]()It .

If the argmnent does not lave a bound i ) reposi-lion , the vahle for p form is none . Thus , the approach adopted within Gram Check is that these err  (   ) r cases have a (   ; or rectrei ) reselltation of the de-t ) enden ( 'y structure where the only off ending in-fl ) rmation is stored as a that ure in the governed e . lement . 
Tit (' , linguistic principle behind the pattern-related t (  ; chni ( tue is based on the fact that native writers substitute al  ) reposition by another one when certain a , qsodations between 1) atterns , showing either the same exi ( : o-semantic and/or syntactic protmrtics , are performed . Thus , this kind of error is not . so a (: cidental as it could lmimagined . 
t , brinstance , Spanish speakers/writersuually associate the argument structure of the comtmr-at  ( read j e ( : tiv ( ~ it@riot ( lower )  , which sul ) cat cgo-rizes the l ) rei ) osition a ( to ) , with the Spanish ( : om-parative syntactic pattern ( inches . . . que . , less . . . 
than ) whose second term is introduced by the con-jun ( : tion q*u ' , producing phrase such as * i ' ~@ rior q ' ae instead of i ' nferiora  . With the verb relacion ar ' ( to relate ) , something similar occurs : t ; his verb sulmatcg orizes for t , he preposition con ; however , due . to the fact ; that there exist stilt : prel ) ositional multiword units ~: nr clo , cidnaan(lc'nr (' . lac . idncon , st ) eakers tend to think that the same 1) ret ) osi-I ; ional alternation can be 1) cr for nm(t with t in ,  . verl ) (* r clacionara vs . r'clacion wrcon ) . 
Following this idea , configurational ruh:s are regarded , R ) r grammardmcking , as desc : riptions of l ) at l ; erns ~ each of them having associated a wrong pattern linked to the correct pattern  . Both pat ; --terns are in a complementary distribution . This way , structural errors can before seen and controlled , and the systeln is provi ( led with a mechanism which establishes the way rule constraints l nust to reaxed  . 
To cope with this error , a CS operating on lists ( : he ( ks whether the prel ) osition in 1 ; tlo ( : on stitu ( mt attached to the predicative sign belongs to the head of the list or to the tail  . If the preposition is member of the tail , the salneactions show lfO\]'agreement errors are performed in standation of the  ( : orrect value and determination of the error type . 
4 Error coverage
The current version of the Grmn Check demonstrator is able to deal with the following types of er- 
I'OFH : ? lntra - and inter-syntagmatie agreement errors  ( gender at t ( l/or number in act , lye with both predicative and ( : opuative verbs and passive sentences )  . 
? Directobje . cts : omission of tit ( : preposition a with an animate entity and addition of such a preposition with a non-animate entity  . 
? Addition , omission and sul ) stitution of a bomM prepositi ( m covering what is ( : aed preposition de with clausal arguments and quegs mo the omission of the bound preposition de with clausal arguments  . 
? Errors Oilportmanteau words ( use . deel , ael instead of del , a O . 
Regarding style issues , three different types of weaknesses are detected : structural weaknesses  , lexical weaknesses and abusive use of passive , gerunds an drammer adverbs . While structural weaknesses are detected in tim phrase structure rules using CSs  ( noun + " a "+ infinitive )  , by means of an error anticipation strategy , lexical weaknesses arc detected at the lexical level  , with nost ) octal mechanisms other than simple CSs . 
Lexieal errors currently detected are related with the use of Latin words which it is better to avoid  , foreign words with Spanish deriwttion , cognitive erl ' or s , foreign words for which a Spanish word is recommended and verbosity  . 
5 Further developments i , esults obtained with the cmTent demonst ; rator are very promising . The performance of the system using CSs is similm ' to that shown widlout them  , hence its us ( ; in conjunction with the detection techniques proposed  , rather than a burden , may be seen as a means to add robustness to NLP systems  . In fact , CSs may provide more natural solutions to grammar implemental  ; ion issues , like
PP-attach mell t control.
Several directions for further developments have a \] ready been defined  . These include the integration of these grammar checking techniques into the final release of the LS-GRAM Spanish grammar  , which will have a more realistic coverage ill terms both of linguistic i  ) he nomen and lexicon . 
Besides , on this new version of the grammar , hybrid teehniques will be used , taking advantage of the preproco . ssing facilities included in ALEP . In particular , while for errors like those presented in this paper the approach adopted is linguistically motivated  , for certainimnctuation errors ( or simply ill order to reduce lexi ( : alarab * girl ( y ) other relatively simple iHea il SC~L libe defined that ill-chide  ( : ertain extended pattern ma . tching on regular expressions or the passing of linguist *  ( : information gathered in at ) reproeessing phase to the unifh : ation-bas ( ' . dparser .
