, , Free word order " is a traditional term that should not be taken literally  . However , we shall retain the term for its conciseness . 
Formal descriptions of = yn tax have been usua lly based either on the immediate consti tuents or on the dependency p ~ i losophy  . Neither of them seems directly applicable to free word order languages  . The intertwining phrases cannot be described naturally by IC rules  . Some coordinate constructions are difficult to describe by me ~ us of dependency relations  . 
In our opinion , parsers for free word order languages should not be based on the methods developed within the IC framework  . 
Scarce experiments with parsers based on the dependency form-alism  , eg . /5/, do not seem promising . Therefore , we decided to take a fresh start and to at tack the problem by reanalys-ing the basic notions of syntax and parsing  . We focus our attention on those formal aspects of a language system which might be most useful for automatic text processing  . We assmae that the morphological level is described along the lines of  /2/4 x ) This paper is an extended abstract of /3/ . 
-37-2. The Notion of S.~t_ax.
In this paper , we understand syntax as the domain of for r~alre lations between words  , i . e . roughly asso-called surface syntax . We define the notion us in ~ a morphology-based criterion  , described below . 
The outcome of morphological analysis can be ambiguous for an isolated word  . In most situations , however , the morpho-logical features of a word are un iquely determined by some formal properties of its context  . 
Sometimes the ambiguity remains , as in the following sentence Op~nienie bryg ~dpiecowyo hspowo do wa ~ opotg pienie wu Ja Jana  . 
1II !! , , . I !! I 1 " ~ l ~ gen " V - ' ~ NP gen "! 1 I 1 ~ nom . / aco . ~ nom . /ac? . 
There are five independent ambiguities in th is sentence  , yielding 32 coherent readings . Two of them are due to Sheneutralization of agent/patient function during nominal i sat ~ ion  . For example , " potgpieniex " means " disapproval of ~' ( either " x disapproves y " or " y disapproves x "  ) i such an ambiguity can be resolved only by exsmining the meav  . ing of a given phrase , so we call it semantic one . 
The next ambiguity Occurs in the phrase " wu Ja Jana "  , that means either " uncle John " gen ? or " John's uncle " gen  . O Here we can see two kinds of syntactic relations : case agreem-ent  ( the former interpretation ) or government ( the latter one )  , which both require " Jana " to be in genitive case  . Such a nambi ~ ulty we consider as purely syntactic one  . 
In the phrase " bry ~ dpleco wych " we call discern either case agreement  ( " piecowych " gen " is then an adjective ) or government ( " piecowych " gen ? is then a noun )  . Here , the elimination of morphological homon ~ my gives rise to alternative constructions  , thus increasing the syntactic ambi~ity ,   -38 -The last ambiguity stems from the nominative /accus at lven eutralization both of a virtual subject and a virtual object of the sentence  . It suffices to assign a syntactic function to one of them ~ the function of the other and the morphological characteristics of both of them will be fully determined  . 
The example demonstrates how certain relations between sentence components allow to disambiguate the morphological properties of individual words without resorting  %0 their meanings . In our approach , these relations constitute the level of syntax /3/  . 
Syntactic relations ( eg . agreement , government ) consist in matching syntactic properties ( eg . case , gender ) of re-speotive u units . The basic unit is a morphological word /2/ . 
By the syntactic structure of a sentence we understand some explicit representation of all the syntactic relations between its components  , usually-a graph . Such a graph need not necessarily be connected . For example , some modifiers are linked to their heads only by semantic relations and not by syntactic ones  . Similarly , some elllptio sentences may have disconnected syntactic representation u  . 
We ~ ulderstand parsing as a process of establishing all syntactic structures of ag iven text  . Although such structur-es are rather unsophisticated  , they are practically very important for low -level text process i ~  . 
In search of an adequate parsing method , we found the idea of ~ arcus / 4/ most appealing . He claims that natural languages are designed to be deterministically parsed from left to right and that writing a grammar should consist in finding out local clues which enable the parser to select properly what to do next  . This idea seems even more advantag-eous for free word order languages  . Rich inflection makes - 39 -the local clues much more explicit and the pareer's expect at-ions more precise  . Besides , such an organisation of the pars-ing process is compatible with the resource control hypothes-is  /1 /which is hoped to account for semantic impl ications of free word order  . 
~ Conclusion
As a practical consequence of the consider at ions given above  , we adopt the following research program . As a starting point we take the existing IC-based syntactic description of Polish sentences with neutral word order  /6  /  , consisting of about 500 rules ( some pv~ts of it have been rewrittening reat-er detail  /7  /  , with the number of rules increasing 510 times )   . 
We are going to restructure the description to obtain an index of expectations related to each syntact i ~ unit  . We shallin-corporate the clues , thus obtained , into some Marcus-style parsing strate ~ . We expect that it will lead to an effic ient and linguistically sound parser for Polish  .
