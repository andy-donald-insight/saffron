1 Introduction
Prosodic Morphology ( McCarthy and Prince ,  1986 , etseq . ) provides adequate means for describing nonlinear phenomena such as infixation  , reduplication and templatic morphology . Standard two-level systems proved to be cumber some in describing such operations - see  ( Sproat ,  1992 , p . 159 ft . ) for a discussion . Multitape two-level morphology ( Kay , 1987; Kiraz ,  1994 , et . seq . ) addresses various issues in the domain of nonlinear morphology : It has been used in analysing root-and-pattern morphology  ( Kiraz ,  1994) , the Arabic broken plural phenomenon ( Kiraz , 1996a ) , and error detection in nonconcatenative strings ( Bowden and Kiraz ,  1995) . The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate how nonlinear operations which are motivated by prosody can also be described within this framework  , drawing examples from Arabic . 
The analysis of Arabic presented here differs from earlier computa \ [ ional accounts in that it employs new linguistic descriptions of Arabic morphology  , viz . moraic and affixational theories ( McCarthy and Prince , 1990b ; McCarthy ,  1993) . 
The former argues that a different vocabulary is Supported by a Benefactor Studentship from St John's College  . This research was done under the supervision of Dr Stephen G  . Pulman . 
needed to represent the pattern morpheme according to the Prosodic Morphology Hypothesis  ( see ?1:1 )  , contrary to the earlier CV model where templates are represented as sequences of Cs  ( consonants ) and Vs ( vowels )  . The latter departed radically from the notion of root-and-pattern morphology in the description of the Arabic verbal stem  ( see ?3 )  . 
The choice of the linguistic model depends on the application in question and is left for the grammarian  . Tile purpose here is to demonstrate hat multitape two-level morphology is adequate for representing these various linguistic models  . 
The following convention has been adopted.
Morphemes are represented in braces ,    , and surface forms in solidi ,  / / . In listings of grammars and lexica , variables begin with a capital letter . 
The structure of the papcr is as follows : Section  2 demonstrates how Arabic templatic morphology can be analysed by prosodic terms  , and section 3 looks into infixation ; finally , section 4 provides some concluding remarks . The rest of this section introduces prosodic morphology and establishes the computational framework behind this presentation  . 
1.1 Prosodic Morphology
There are three essential principles in prosodic morphology  ( McCarthy and Prince , 1990a ; Mc-
Carthy and Prince , 1993) . They are : ( i ) a . PROSODIC MOR PHOLOGY HYPO THE-SIS . Templates are defined in terms of the authentic units of prosody : mora  ( it )  , syllable (~) , foot(Ft ) , prosodic word ( PrWd ) . 
b . TEMPLATESATISF ACTION CONDI-
TION . Satisfaction of templates constraints is obligatory and is determined by the principles of prosody  , both universal and language-specific . 
664 c . PROSODIC CIRCUM SCRIPTION . The domain to which morphological operations apply may be circumscribed by prosodic riteria as well as by the more familiar morphological ones  . 
In the Prosodic Morphology Hypothesis , morn is the unit of syllabic weight ; a monomoraic syllable , oh , islight(L ) , and a bimoraic syllable , a  ~ , ~ , is heavy ( H ) . The most common types of syllables are : open light  , CV , open heavy , CVV , and closed heavy , CVC . This typology is represented graphically in (2) . 
G (7(7
CVC VVC VC
Association of Cs and Vs to templates i based on the Template Satisfaction Condition  . Association takes the following form : a node a always takes a C  , and amorn  #takes a V ; however , in bi-morale syllables , the second #may be associated to either a Cora V Prosodic Circumscription  ( PC ) defines the domain of morphological operations . Normally , the domain of a typical morphological operation is a grammatical category  ( root , stem or word ) , resulting in prefixation or sufilxation . Under PC , however , the domain of a morphological operation is a prosodically-delimited substring within a grammatical category  , often resulting in some sort of infixation . The essential for PC is a parsing function ~ I ~ of the form in  ( 3 )  . 
(3) PARSING FUNCTION+(c,E)
Let B be a base ( i . e . stem or word ) . The function ~ I ~ returns the constituent C that sits on the edge EE right  , left ) of the base B . The result is a factoring of B into : kernel , designated by B : ~ , which is the string returned by the parsing function  , and residue , designated by B/O , which is the remainder of B . The relation between B : ~ and B/~is given in ( 4 )  , where ~ is the concatenation operator . 
(4) FACTORING OF BBY(I)
B = B : ~ ~ B/,~
To illustrate this , let B =/ katab /; applying the function O(al , , Left ) on B factors it into: ( i ) the kernel B : ~= / ka / , and ( ii ) the residue 1Other conventions associate consonant melo dies left-to -right to themorale nodes  , followed by associating vowel melodies to syllable-initial mora e  . 
=/ tab/.
A morphological operation O(e . g . O="Prefixt " ) defined on a base B is denoted by O ( B )  . 
There are two types of PC:positive ( PPC ) and negative ( NPC )  . In PPC , the domain of the operationistile kernel B : , IJ ; this type is denoted by O : ~ and is defined in ( 5a )  . In NPC , the domain is the residue B/O ; this type is denoted by 0/4 ) and is defined in ( 5b )  . 
(5) DEFINITION OF PPCAND NPCa . PPC,O:O(B):O(B : ~) ~ B/Ob . NPC , O/O(B ) = B : O ~ O(B/ , I ~) In other words , in PPC , O applies to the kernel B : ~ , concatenating the result with the residue B/O ; in NPC , O applies to the residue B/O , concatenating the result with the kernel B : O . Examples are provided in section 3 . 
1.2 Multi-Tape Two-Level Formalism
Two-level morphology ( Koskenniemi ,  1983 ) defines two levels of strings in recognition and synthesis : lexical strings represent morphemes  , and surface strings represent surface forms . Two-level rules map the two strings ; the rules are compiled into finite state transducers  , where lexical strings siton one tape of the transducers and surface strings on the other  . 
Multitape two-level morphology is an extension to standard two-level morphology  , where more than one lexical tape is allowed . The notion of using multiple tapes first appeared in  ( Kay ,  1987) . 
Motivated by Kay's work , ( Kiraz , 1994) proposed a multitape two-level model . The model adopts the formalism in ( 6 ) as reported by ( Pulman and
Hepple , 1993).
LLCLEX RLC :: ~ , ~(6) LSC-SURI , ' RSC where LLC is the left , lexical context , LEX is the lexical form , RLC is the right lexical context , LSC is the left surface context , SURF is the surface form , and RSC is the right surface context . 
The special symbol * indicates an empty context , which is always satisfied . The operator = ~ states that LEX may surface as SURF in the given context  , while the operator <= ~ adds the condition that when LEx appears in the given context  , then the surface description must satisfy SuR ~ . The latter caters for obligatory rules . A lexical string maps to a surface string iff ( 1 ) they call be partitioned into pairs of lexical -surface subsequences  , where each pair is licenced by a rule , and (2) no partition violates an obligatory rule . 

One of the extensions introduced in the multitape version is that all expressions in the lexical side of the rules  ( i . e . LLC , LEx and RLC ) aren-tuple of regular expressions of the form ( xl , x2 ,   . . . , xn ) . The ith expression refers to symbols on the ith tape  . When n = 1 , the parentheses can be ignored ; hence , ( x ) and x are equivalent .   2   2 Templatic Morphology Templatic morphology is best exemplified in Semitic root-and-pattern morphology  . This section sets a framework under which templatic morphology can be described using  ( augmented ) two-level theory . Our presentation differs from previous proposals a in that it employs prosodic morphology in the analysis of Arabic  , rather than earlier CV accounts . Arabic verbal forms appear in ( 7 ) in the passive ( rare forms are not included )  . 
(7) ARABIC VERBAL MEASURES (18 ,  10 )   1 kutib 2 kuttib 3 kuutib 4 ' euktib 5 tukuttib 6 tukuutib 7 nkutib 8 k tutib 10 stuktib ( McCarthy ,  1993 ) points out that Arabic verbal forms are derived from the base template in  ( 8 )  , which represents Measure 1 . a ~ represents an ex-trametrical consonant ; hai ; is , the last consonant in astein . 
(8) ARABICBASE TEMPLATE
O-0"O-mkutib
The remaining measures are derived from the base template by a fiqxation  ; they have no templates of their own . The simplest operation is prefixation , e . g . n + Measure 1-+/ nkutib / ( Measure 7) . 
M ea su res 4 and 10 are derived in a similar fashion , but undergo a rule of syncope as shown in (9) . 
2 Our implementation interprets rules directly ( see ( Kiraz , 1996c )); hence , we allow unequal representation of strings . If the rules were to be compiled into automata , a genuine symbol , e . g . 0, must be introduced by the rule compiler . For the compilation of our formalism into automata  , see ( Grimley-Evans et al ,  1996) . 
a Non-linear proposals include ( Kay ,  1987) , ( Kor-nai ,  1991) , ( Wiebe ,  1992) , ( Narayanan and Hashem ,  1993) , ( Bird and Ellison , 1994) and ( Kiraz ,  1994) . 
A working system for Arabic is reported by ( Beesley et al , 1989; Beesley , 1990; Beesley ,  1991) .

M ea su re 10: stu+kutib*/stukutib/~ Y2~ ' e/stuktib/The following lexicon and two -level grammar demonstrate how the above measures can be analysed under two-level theory  . The lexicon maintains four tapes : pattern , root , vocalism and affix tapes . 
1 ~ . ~ , ,< , :  2 ktb 3 ui 4 ~ V 4 n 4 stV pattern :\[ measure = ( i-8 , 10)\] root:\[measure=(1-4 , 6 -8  , 10)\] vocalism :\[ tense=perf , voice = pass\]verb_affix :\[ measure=4\] verb_affix :\[ measure=g\]verb_affix :\[ measure = lO\]The first column indicates the tape on which the morphemes its  , and the second column gives the morpheme . Eactl lexical entry is associated with a category and a feature structure of the form cat : FS  ( column 3 )  . Feature values in parentheses are disjunctive and are implenlented using boolean vectors  ( Mellish , 1988; Pulman ,  1994) . 
a ~ a , , a ~ is tile base-template . k tb ' notion of writing ' is the root ; it may occur in all measures apart from Measure 5 . 4 ui is the perfective passive vocalism . Tile remaining morphemes represent the affixes for Measures  4  , 7 and 10 . Notice that the vowelill the affixes of M ea su res  4 and 10 is a variable V . This maims it possible for the affix to have a different vowel according to the inood of the following stem  , e . g . \[ a\]in/paktab / ( Measure 4 , active ) and \[ u \] in/puktib / ( Measure 4 , passive ) . 
Since the lexicon declares 4 lexical tapes , each lexical expression in the two-level grammar must be at most a  4-tuple   . A grammar for the derivation of the cited data appears below  .

The remaining Measures involve infixation and are discussed in the next section  . 
3 Infixation
Standard two-levels models can describe some ( ; lasses of infixation , but resorting totile use of adhoc diacritics which have no linguistic significance  , e . g . ( Antworth , 1990, p .  156) . This section presents a framework for describing infixa-lion rules using our multitape two-level formalism  . This is illustrated here by analysing Measures 2 and 8 of the Arabic verb . M ea su re 2 , / kut-lib / , is derived by prefixing a mora to the base template under NI?C  . The operation is 0 =' prefix id and tile rule is ( )/ R~ ( a  ~ , Left ) . The new mora is filled by the spreading of the adjacent  ( second ) consonant . The steps of the derivation are : O/~\[~ ( kutib ) = kutib@* (   )   ( kutib : 0--ku * O ( tib ) = ku*/ztib=ku * ttib:kuttibMeasure 8   , /ktutib / , is derived by the aflixation of at to the base template  , under NP(\] . The operation is O = ' prefix t ' ; the rule is O/'I , ( C ,  \[ , eft ;) , where C is a consonant . The process is : O/l ( kutib ) --kutib : I ~* O ( kutib : ~ ) :: k*O ( utib ) - - k * tutibk tutib The following two-lew ' J grammar builds on the one discussed in section  2  . The following lexieal entry gives the Measure 8 morpheums .

RulesI1,7-11,8 are measure-struttic . Each ruh ; is associated with a feature structure which must unify with the feature structures of the affecl  ; ed lexical entries . This ensures that each rule is applied only to the  1  ) roper in easure . 
I1 , 7 handles Measm'e 2 ; it represents the operation O --' prefix it ' and the rule  (   )  /~ ( a  ~ , Left ) by placing B : ~ I ~ in LLC and the residue B/~in 11LC   , and inserting a consonant C ( representing t ~ ) on the surface . The filling of/t by the spreading of the second iadical is achieved by the unification of C in LF x with C in RLC  . 
I1 , 8 takes care of Measure 8 ; it represents the operation ( ) -- ' prefix  t ' and the rule O/'l i ( C , Left ) . Note that one cm motplace B : ~\[~ and B/i \ [ , in LLC and I/ , LC , respectively , astilt ; ease in 1/ , 7 because the parsing function cuts into the first syllable  .

4 Conclusion
This paper have demonstrated that multitape two -level systems offer a richer and more powerful devices than those in standard two-level models  . 
This makes the multitape version capable of modelling nonlinear operations such as infixation and templatic morphology  . 
The rules and lexie a samples reproduced here are based on a larger morphological grammar written for the Sem He implementation  ( a multitape two-level system ) -for a full description of the system , see ( Kiraz , 1996c ; Kiraz , 1996b ) .
