Abstract This paper describes our work on parsing Turkish using the lexical-functional grammar formalism  . This work represents the first effort for parsing Turkish  . Our implementation is based on Tomita's parser developed at Carnegie Mellon University Center for Machine Translation  . The grammar covers a substantial subset of Turkish including simple and complex sentences  , and deals with a reasonable amount of word order freeness  . The complex agglutinative morphology of Turkish lexical structures is handled using a separate two-level morphological naly zer  . 
After a discussion of key relevant issues regarding Turkish grammar  , we discuss aspects of our system and present results fi'om our implementatiou  . Our initial results suggest that our system can parse about  82% of the sentences directly and almost all the remaining with very minor pre-editing  . 
1 INTRODUCTION
As part of our ongoing work on the development of computational resources for natural anguage processing in Turkish we have undertake u the development of a parser for Turkish using the lexical-functional grammar formalism  , for use in amtmber of applications . This work represents the first approach to the computational nalysis of Turkish  , though there have been a number of studies of Turkish syntax fi'om a linguistic perspective  (   . g . ,\[ Meskill 1970\]) . 
Our implementation is based on Tomita's parser developed at Carnegie Mellon University Center for Machine Translation \ [ Musha et  . al . 1988, Tomita 1987\] . Our grammar covers a substantial subset of Turkish including simple and complex sentences  , and deals with a reasonable amount of word order freeness  . 
Turkish has two characteristics that have to be taken into account : agglutinative morphology  , and rather ti ' ee word order with explicit case marking  . We handle the rather complex agglutinative morphology of the Turkish lexical structures using a separate morphological processor based on the two-level paradigm\[Evans  1990  , Otlazer 1993\] that we have integrated with the lexical -functional grammar parser  . 
Word order freeness is dealt with by relaxing the order of phrases in the phrase structure parts of lexical-functional gramm  . ai " rule by means of generalized phrases .

2 LEXICAL-FUNCTION ALGRAMMAR
Lexical-functional gramnmr ( LFG ) is a linguistic theory which fits nicely into computational p proaches that use unification IS hieber  1986\]  . A lexical-functional grammar assigns two levels of syntactic description to every sentence of a language : a constituent sructure and a functional structure  . Constituent sructures ( c-structures ) characterize the phrase structure configurations a a conventional phrase structure tree  , while surface grammatical function such as subject  , object , and adjuncts are represented in functional structure  ( f-structure )  , Because of space limitations we will not go into the details of the theory  . One can refer to Kaplan and Bresnan \[ Kaplan and Bresnan  1982\] for a thorough discussion of the LFG formalism . 
3 TURKISH SYNTAX
In this section , we would like to highligh two of the relevant key issues in Turkish grammar  , namely highly inflected agglutinative morphology and free word order  , and give a description of the structural classification of Turkish sentences that we deal with  . 
3.1 Morphology
Turkish is an agglutinative language with word structures formed by productive affixations of derivation alnd inflectional suffixes to root words\[Ottazer  1993\]  . This extensive use of suffixes causes morphological parsing of words to be rather complicated  , and results iu ambiguous lexical interpretations in many cases  . For example : (1) ~ ocuklarla . child + PLU+3SG-POSS his children b . child + 3 PL-POSS their child c . child + PLU+3 PL-POSS their children d . child + PLU+ACC children ( acc . ) Such ambiguity can sometimes be resolved at phrase and sentence lvels by the help of agreement requireule tlts though this is not always possible:  ( 2a ) Onlarm qocu klarl geldiler . 
it+PLU+GEN child+PLU cone+PAST+3 PL-POSS+3PL ( Their children came . )

( Their children came.)
For example , in (2a ) only the interpretation ( lc ) ( i . e . , : heir et , ihlren ) is possible because : ? the agreement requirement between lhemodifier and the modified parts in a possessive compound norm eliminates  ( la )   .  ~  , , the facts that gel ( come ) does not subcategorize for an accusative marked direct object  , and that in Turkish the subject of a sentence must be nominative  3 el intin at el id )  . 
? the agreement requirement between the subject and the verb of a sentence liminates lib  )  . 4In (2b ) , both ( la ) and ( lc ) are possible ( his children , and their children , respectively ) because the moditier of the possessive compound noun is It cover tone : it may be either on un  ( his ) or onlart n ( their )  . The other two interpretations are eliminate due to the same reasons as in  ( 2a )  . 
3.2 Word Order
If we concern ourselves with the typical order o\ [ constituents  , Turkish can be characterized as being a subject- object-verb  ( SOV ) language , though the data in Table 1 fiomErguwmh\[Erguwmh I979\]  , shows that other orders for constituents are also common  ( especially in discourse )  . 
In Turkish it is not the position , but the case of a noun phrase that determines its grammatical function in the  sei1-tence   . Consequently typical order of the constituents may change rather freely without affecting the grammaticality of a sentence  . Due to various syntactic and pragmatic constraints  , sentences with the non-typical orders are not 2The agreement of the modilier milSt betims anleas the Imssessiv col the moditied wilh the exception that if the modilic rist hirdllers on phn ' althe imssessive of the modilied may be third person singular  .

an@e , a constituenll hat is to be emphasized is generally placed immediately before the verb  . This affects the places of all the constittmnts in a sentence x cept that of the verb :  ( 3a ) Ben ~ , ' ocu ~ akilabtverdim .

l book + A Ce child + l ) AT give + l % ST + tSG ( It was file child to whomlgave timbook . )  ( 3a ) is an example of timty pk : al word order whereas in  ( 31 ) ) the subject , ben , is eml ) hasized . Similarly , in (3c ) the indirect object , (' oeu , @ , is eml ) hasized . 
In addition to these i ) ossihle changes , the verb itself tnay move away from its lypical place  , i . e . , the endor I hesen-CIICC . ~tlchsga\[etlces alc called inverted . ~' gnlences ;   I1KI are typically used in informal prose and discourse  .

A nominative direct object should be placed immediately before the verb  . 5 llence ,   ( 51 ) ) is ungramlnatical : 6 ( 5a ) Benq'oeu ~ a Mtapvet ( lira .

,Simple Sentences : A simple sentence contains only one independent judgement  . The sentences in 12) ,  (3) , (4a ) , (5a ) , and (6) are all examples of simple sentences . 
,Complex Sentences : In Turkish , a sentence can be transformed into a construction with a verbal not ttt  , a participle or a gerund by affixing certain suffixes to the verb of the sentence  . Complex sentences are those that include such dependent  ( subordinate ) clauses as their constituents , or as modifiers of their constituents . Dependent clauses may themselves contain other dependent clauses  . So , we may have embedded structures such as : ( 7 ) Buradasuhere+LOC water bula mayaca ~ imlfind+NEG -POT+FUT+PART+ISG-POSS+AC Colmazd Lbe+NEG + AOR +  PAST+3SG iqile bilecek drink+PASS+POT+FUT+PART zannet mek do ~  , ruthin k + lNFright ( It wouldn't have been right forme to think that I wouldn't be able to find drinkable water here  . ) The subject of ( 7 )   ( buradai ? ilebile ceksubula may-a cafi , tmtzannet mek-to think that I wouldn't be able to find drinkable water here  ) is a nominal dependent clause whose definite object  ( buradaifi le bilecek subula mayaca ~ mtt-that I wouldn't be able to find drinkable water here  ) is an adjectival dependent clause which acts as a nominal one  . 
The indefinite object of this defnite object ( ifile bileceksu-drinkable water ) is a conlpound noun whose n lodifier part is another adjectival dependent clause  ( ifile bilece k-drinkable )  , and modified part is a noun ( su-water ) . 
It should be noted that there are other types of sentences in the classification according to structure  , t to wever , we will not be concerned with them here because of space limitations  . ( See $ im ~ ek\[$imsek1987\] , and Gting ( ~rdft\[GfingOrdi ~1993\] for details . ) 4 SYSTEMARCHITECTUREANDIM-

morphological rules as the parser lets us incorporate on rown morphological naly zer for w bich we use a full scale two-level specification of Turkish morphology based on a lexicon of about  24  , 000 root words \[ Oflazer 1993\] . This lexicon is nminly used for morpbological nalysis  . ' rod has limited additional syntactic and semantic information  , and is augmented with an argument structure database  . 8 Figure 1 shows the architecture of our system . When a sentence is given as input to t be program , the program first calls the morphological naly zer lot-each word in the sentence  , and keeps the results of these calls in a list to be used later by the parser  . " If the tnorpt'~ologicalt mlyzer fails to return a structure for a word for any reason  ( e . g . , the lexicon may lack the word or the word may be misspelled  )  , the program returns with an error message . After the morphological ttalys is is completed , the parser is invoked to check whether the sentence is granmmtical  . The parser performs bottom-uparsing . During this analysis , whenever it consumes a new word from he sentence  , it picks lip the morphological structt trc of this word from the list  . If the word is a finite verb or an intinitiwt l , the parser is also provided with the subcategorizatiou frante  o1' the word , At the end of the analysis , if the sentence is grammatical , its f-structure is output by the parser . 
8The morphological mudyzer eturns a list nfJkature -vahw pairs  . For instance for lhewardev dekiler in ( of those ( things ) in the house/your things in the house ) it will relorll I .

In this section , we present an overview of the LI'~ ( Ispec-itication that we have developed for Turkish syntax  . Our grammar in chldes rules for sentences , dependent clauses , noun phrases , adjectival phrases , postpositional phraxes , adverbial constructs , verb phrases , and a number of h : ~: i-callook up rules . I ? " lable 2 presents the number of rules for each category in the grammar  . There are also some intermediary rules , not shown here . 
Recall that the typical order of constituents in a sentence may change due to a number of reasons  . Since the order of phrases is tixed in the phrase structure component of an LFG rule  , t iffs rather free nature of word order in sentence level constitutes a major problem  . In order to keep fi'om using a number of redundant rules we adopt t be following strategy in our rules : We use the same place bolder  , < XP > , for all the syntactic ategories in the phrase structure component of a sentence or a dependent chmse rule  , and check the categories of these phrases in the eqtm tions part of the rule  . 
In Figure 2 , we give a granmmr rule for the sentence with two constituents  , with an informal description of the equatkm part . ~ Recall also that an indefinite objects houk\[ be placed immediately before tile verb  , : md some adverbial complenmnts of quality ( those that are actually qualitative adjectives ) always precede tile verb or , if it exists , the indefinite direct object . In our grammar , we treat such objects and adverbial complements as parts of the verb phrase  . So , we do not check these constraints at the sentence or depeudeut clause level  .

These were: , , sentences that contain finite sentences as their constituents or modifiers of their constituents  ,   , , conditional sentences ,   , , finite sentences that are connected by coordinators  ( and/or )  , and , , sentences with discontinuous constituents .   13 We pre-edited the texts so that the sentences were in our scope  ( e . g . , separated finite sentences connected by coordinators and parsed them as independent sentences  , and ignored the conditional sentences ) . Table 3 presents SOmE statistical information about the test runs  . The first , second and third column show the document number , the total number of sentences and the number of sentences that WE could parse without pre -editing  , respectively . The other columns show the number of sentences that we totally ignored  , then nmber of sentences in the pre-edited versions of the documents  , average n nmber of parses per sentence generated and average CPU time for each of the sentences in the texts  , respectively . It can be seen that our grammar can successfully deal with about  82% of the sentences that we have experimented with , with almost all remaining sentences becoming passable after a minor pre-editing  . This indicates that our grammar coverage is reasonably satisfactory  . 
Below , we present the output for a sentence which shows very nicely where the structural ambigttity comes out in Turkish  . 14 The output tbr ( Sat indicates tlmt there are \]' out " 12We should however note that the times reported are exclusive  o1' tile time taken by the morphologicul proees sm , which with a 24 , 0 00 word root lexicon is rathers low and can process about  23 lexical forms per second . We have , however , ported our morphological na-lyzer to the XEI ~ . OXT WOL system developed by Karttunen and P , eesley\[Karttunenad Beesley 1992\] and this system can process about 500 forms a second . We intend to integrate histo our system so on . 
1 3Word order freeness in Turkish allows various kinds of discontinuous consfituents  , e . g . , an adverbial djunct cutting in tile middle of a compound noun  .

4997 CONCLUSIONS AND SUGGESTIONS
We have presented a summary and highlights of our current work on providing an LFG specilication for Turkish syntax  . To the best of our knowledge this is the tirst such effort for constructing a computational grammar for Tnrk-ish  . Our domain include structurally simple and complex Turkish sentences  . The rather complex morphological - yses of agglutinative words structures of Turkish are handled by a full scale two-level morphological specitication implemented in PC-KIMMO  . 
We have number of directions for improving our grammar and parser : ? Turkish is very rich in terms of adverbial constructs  . 
We handle a great deal of these constructs by using a large number of rules  . We are now in the process of developing a tagger with a multiword construct recognizer to preprocess the text so that many multiword and idiomatic constructs can he handled outside the grammar  . In this way , multiword constructs such as y a pary a pmaz ( do + AOR+3SG do + NEG+AOR+3SG )   ( as soon as ( one ) does ( that ) ) where both lexical categories are verbal but the com l~ound construct is an adverb  , can be handled , so can idiomatic constructs like yantstra ( side+3 SG-POS Srow )   ( besides ) where the flmction and semantics of the multiword construct has nothing to do with the function and semantics of the constituent lexical tbrms  . 
? We are currently working on extending the subset of sentences dealt within respect of structure  . 
? We are currently working on augmenting our lexicon with substantial lexical information and selectional restriction information to be used with an integrated ontological database  .
