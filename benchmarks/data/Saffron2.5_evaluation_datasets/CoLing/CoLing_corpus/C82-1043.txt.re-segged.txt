This paper describes an approach to Japanese -English trans-lation through internal expressions which are similar to those used in our recent approach to English-Japanese translation  \[2\]  . Attention is focused on construction of ~ he internal expressions of Japanese sentences based on case structures of predicates and also conversion of the Japanese internal expressions to the English ones for generating good English sentences in conventional use  . Finally , associated with translation , extraction of specified translated information from Japanese patent claim sentences is described briefly  . 
i . CASESTRUCTURES ANDPARSING
In every Japanese sentence a predicate such as the main verb is located at the end of the sentence and takes a part of the governor of the preceding dependants as follows : tlJl  t2   J2   .   .   .   . tn3nP " In the above t . ( i = 1, 2 ~ . - . , n ) denotes a term depending on the predicate p and j  . denotes apos ~ posltlonoraease suffix such as " Kakujoshi " and other aux-  . 1ll ! ary words . 
Japanese is an allutinative language ? A postposition j  . of a term t . clari-llies the syntactic role of the term t . in a sentence governed by the mai ~ verb . 
?  . l Conversely , a set of these postposlt lons or syntactic case labels determines the syntactic function of the main verb in a sentence and is called a verb pattern  . 
The verb pattern plays an important role to identify the syntactic structures of sentences in Japanese like Horn by's verb patterns in English ? From a semantic viewpoint  , Japanese predicates are classified to about 20 main categories and case structures are defined based on the verb categories and the verb patterns  . The case labels and the categorical names used here are chosen the same as those of English case structures in the previous paper  \[2\]  . 
Table 1 shows case frames constructed on the verb pattern  VP9 of a verb which takes syntactic cases of SUBJect , OBJect and DATIVE accompanied with representative postpositions " ga "  , " wo " and " hi " respectively . 
Table 2 shows an instance of description of a verb in the word dictionary constructed on the case frame basis  . The first and second columns show the names of verb patterns and semantic main categories taken by the verb respectively  . They give the token of the case frame of the verb  . The third and forth columns show the equivalents of the verb and the names bf their Horn by's verb patterns  . If there are some equivalents in a row of categories  , some key tokens such as pairs of a ease-label and a subcategory taken by their dependants are added in order that a better equivalent can be chosen  . 
The next example shows some Japanese sentences which have the main verb illustrated in Table  2  , the internal expressions and the corresponding English sentences  , where the postpositions in Japanese sentences are enclosed with parentheses  , and the symbol "*" in the internal expressions denotes the term which is in front of the f~ame including the s~r~ol  .

Example 1 ( a ) VPI ( i ) ears - ( no ) number- ( ga ) rapidly is increasing ( 2 )   ( P ~ gD-ATTR-T ~ ANS : increase , TENSE ; present , ASPECT : progressive , OBJ-NUMBer = nu ~ er ( NUM : ~ , OBJ-PHYS , OBJ:cars ) , MANN : rapidly )   ( 3 ) The number of cars is rapidly increasing .

_Parsing is performed by using the case frame . First , all the words involved in a sentence are retrieved from the di~tlonary  . Then all the possible parsings under respective frame conditions are carried out in parallel from the left of the sentence  . The case labels of dependants are determined by referring to the syntactic and semantie categories of the dependants and the case frame of the governor  . 
The internal expressions sometimes lack the agent ease or the object case corresponding to the original Japanese sentence  . When the internal form has a predicate affecting on some objects and lacks the agent in the active voice  , it is expanded into an English sentence in the passive voice  . When the main predicate belongs to category of state such as existence and attribute and lacks the object case  , an appropriate pronoun to the context such as " it "  , " we " or " they " is substituted for the thematized object case as the general environment or the general experlencer  . 
Japanese noun words are not obliged to have articles which give a measure of definiteness to an object indicated by a noun word  . Since English noun words take determiners such as articles obligatorily in many cases  , the articles must be restored from the context of the Japanese sentences in  , construction of their internal expressions . The restoration is carried out in many cases by anaphorie analysis and reference to information about the conventional use of articles described for every noun phrase in the word dictionary  . 
JAPANESE-ENGLISH TRANS LATION THROUGHIN TERNAL EXPRESSIONS  273   2  . CASECONVERSION The case structures of Japanese and English are partly different from each other at the level of the internal expressions currently used  . Though constituents of case structures such as categorical names and case labels are chosen the same in both languages  , there are different expressions due to logically possible combinations of a governor and the dependants for the same event or the same action  , and the preferable combination depends on the individual language  . 
On the other hand , it is desired that a thematic term is kept unchanged through translation  . Syntactically the thematic term takes the front part of a sentence in both English and Japanese  , and furthermore , takes the subject case in English . 
Hence if the internal expression obtained from a Japanese sentence does not satisfy these conditions  , some conversions are tried to yield a more suitable English internal expression  . Some of them are shown in the following . 
2 . 1 Conversion of Existence and Attribute Expression As wellknoWn  , Japanese is a BE language while English is a HAVE language  . In Japanese the possessive expression is almost confined to the case where a human has something in his hand  , and the other possessive expressions in English are generally described in existence and attribute expressions  . 
Example 2
Let us consider the following sentences : ( a ) He has a daughter . ( b ) Copper has high electric conductivity . 
They are usually expressed in Japanese as follows : he-  ( niwa ) a - ( no ) daughter- ( ga ) is ( 2 )   ( PRED-EXIST : is , OBJ-HUM : a daughter , LOC-HUM : ~) (3) With hi=~m is a daughter . 
( b )   ( i ) ~ ~ i ~ m ~ ~ copper- ( wa ) electric conductivity - ( ga ) is high ( 2 )   ( PRED-ATTR : is high , OBJ-PHYS . QUANT : electric conductivity,
LOC-PHYS . OBJ : as for copper )   ( 3 ) As for copper eiectric conductivity is high . 
In each illustration above , ( i ) , (2) and (3) denote a Japanese sentence , the internal expression with terms replaced with English equivalents and a literal translation obtained by rewriting the internal expression respectively  . The part with a double underline denotes a thematic part in the source sentence  . 
As seen from the above the literal translation does not preserve the thematic term of the original Japanese sentence within the standard English sentential form  . 
The translation with the thematic term unchanged requires replacement of the main predicate by HAVE verb and the accompanied case conversion as shown in Table  3  . Rules 1 and 2 are conversion rules of Japanese EXIS Tence and ATTRibute expressions to English POS Sessive expressions  .

Japanese ( PRED-ATTR : tn , OBJ-PHYS . QUANT : tI,
LOC-PHYS . OBJ : t2)
English ( PRED-POSS : have , POSSESSOR-PHYS . OBJ : t_,OBJ-PHYS . QUANT : tI(PRED-ATTR:to,OB~:e))
Example 3274 F . NISHIDA and S . TAKAMATSU The applications of the above rules to the internal expressions in Example  2 yield the following expressions . 
( a ) ( PRED-POSS : has , POSSESSOR-HUM : he , OBJ-HUM : a daughter ) ( b ) ( PRED-POSS : has , POSSESSOR-PHYS'OBJ : copper , OBJ-PMYS . QUANT : electric conduct ~ vlty ( PRED-ATTR : be high , OBJ : e ) ) These intern&l expressions can be rewritten to the sentences  ( a ) and ( b ) near the heading of Example 2 . 
2 . 2 Conversion of State-Orlented Expressions Japanese is a state-oriented language and often takes a type of description that thing A changes to thing B owing to thing C in an event  . If C is a non-llving object , C is interpreted as a cause or an instrument rather than an agent from the standpoint of translation  , and usually does not take the subject case even if C is emphasized  . 
On the other hand , English is an action-oriented language and often uses exupressions such that thing C makes thing A change to B even if the category of C is a nonliving object  . 
The following shows some conversion rules between the above expressions  . 
Rule3(PRED:TA , OBJ : t ~ MEANSuCAUSEUINSTR : ~ I)~PRED . to , AG:~i'OBJ : t2 ) Rule ' ~ ( PRED:to~MODAL : capable , AG : t2 , \[ OBJ:t .  \],
MEANSuCAUSE uINS~R : ~ I ) ( PRED-ENABLE : tc , AG : t .   , OBJ:(p ~: to , AG : t2 , \[ OBJ:t3\])) , where the left sides of the rules are Japanese case structures and the right sides are those of English  , categorical names are omitted except the case particularly required  , and the contents enclosed with brackets denote some optional items  , t ' is a transitive verb such as VP6A corresponding to an intransitive verb or a O transltive verb in the passive voice t  0 in Rule 3  . 
Example 4 ( 1 ) ~? ~~ ~ ~ ~ ~ this signal- ( niyori ) machine- ( ga ) reliably start ( 2 )   ( PRED-PTRANS : start , OBJ-PHYS . OBJ:machine , INSTR-THINGS : this signal,
MANN : reliably )   ( 3 ) By this signal the machine starts reliably . 
(4) ( PRED-PTRANS : start , VOICE : active , AG-THINGS : this signal , OBJ-PHYS , OBJ:machine , MANN : reliably )   ( 5 ) This signal starts the machine reliably .  % 3 . SOMETRANS LATION RESULTS Along the line described in the preceding sections  , some experiments on translation have been carried out in an interactive mode  . The average translation time excluding word retrieval and interaction is about  0  . 3 5 seconds per a Japanese word ? Some experimental results are shown in this section  , where names of categories in the inter~al expressions are omitted for simplicity ?

In the above translation , Rule 3 was applied to the underlined parts ~ and in paragraph  ( B ) to yield ~ ) ~ and ~ in paragraph ( C ) respectively in order to keep the thematic or emphatic temms unchanged  .

In pamsing The system asked whe Them the underlined part  ( a ) in para ~ aph ( A ) depended on the pal-is ( b ) or ( c ) and obtained the answer fmom the user . FoP con-st ~ uctlon of a better English internal expression  , Rule 2 was applied To the attribute expressions of The underlined parts ~  ) and ~ in para E Taph ( B ) to yield the possessive expmess lons ~ and ~/ in para Ei ~ aph  ( C ) respectively . Furthermore , the active voice expression of the underlined pamt ~ in pamagraph  ( B ) which lacks the AGent case was converted into The passive voice expression shown in the underlined paPt ~ in paragraph  ( C )  . 
~ . EXTRACTION OF SPECIFIED TRANS LATEDIN FOR MATION By using a method similar to the above case conversion  , specified structural information w~it Ten in English can be extracted f~om Japanese Texts in parallel with their translation  . Each specification Table fo ~ information extraction used here consists of several case frames  , and each case frame has a standard case structure com responding To a simple sentence or a phPase  . Table ~ is a n-example 276 F . NISHIDA and S . TAKAMATSU of specification tables used for patent claim sentences  .

Japanese and English are fairly different languages from each other  . However , if the object field of processing is confined to some technical fields  , it is expected from the above consideration that semiautomatic multilingual translation and extraction of specified structural information are realizable though there are left various refinement problems such  . as restoration of articles .
