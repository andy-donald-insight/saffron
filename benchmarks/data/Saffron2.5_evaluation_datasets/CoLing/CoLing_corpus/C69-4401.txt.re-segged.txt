SYNTACTIC PATTERNS IN A SAMPLE
OFTECHNICAL ENGLISH
The Importance of the Concept of Homogeneity
A fundamental assumption of statistical linguistics 
is that there are differences worthy of note in the frequency of various units in certain texts  . At the same Time , there are differences in frequencies which would not be considered important  . The question is , how is an " important " difference tObe determined ? Theme solution of this pmoblem has been made more important by the increasing populamity of statistical ap-pmoaches to questions of style and authorship  . Definitions of style from this point of view are based on notions of distinctiveness and consis tency in literary performance  . 
While distinctiveness appears to be the more important component of style  , it is recognized that some consistency is necessary to lend significance to whatever feature might be distinctive  . 
The Deter , nination of Homogeneity
For this discussion we define homogeneity as the similarity of parts of the whole with respect to certain features  . For some features it may be perfectly clear , even without counting , that parts of a text or texts from a genre are not alike  . This seems more likely to occur for some features and for some genmes than for others  , for-1-example , syntactic or phonological constructions in poetry  , as opposed to parts of speech in technical writing  . 
Few would be satisfied to rely solely on subjective impression fom the estimation of the similarity of text samples  . For statistical linguists the decision to count is the foundation of their science  . Fop literary scholars the decision to count stems from a desire to give quantitative verification of existing theories and interpretations  , and to gain greater insight into the structure of literary works for the purpose of proposing new theories and interpretations  . Both groups are faced with the problem of evaluating the results of the counting  . 
The Nature of Statistical Tests
The techniques of statistical description ame , of course , uniquely suited to the statement of the raw , uninterpreted results . Measures of location such as means , modes , medians are commonly used for this purpose . 
In examining the raw results it may be clear at once that there is a meaningful difference among the counts or scopes  . If samples of 100 sentences were taken at random from each of two texts  , and the mean lengths for the two samples were 20 words and W0 words , no one would hesitate to conclude that one text revealed ar ' significantly " greater sentence length than the other  . But if the figures were closer , say 27 and 33 , more exact methods a peneeded . 

It is a law of nature that a sample taken from a population will not always yield exactly the statistics of the popula-Ti on  , that on occasion even a large discrepancy will be found  . The extent to which sample values may be expected to vary from population values through chance alone is a subject of mathematical statistics  , as is the extent to which two or more sample values from the same population will differ  . 
Language Statistics and Homogeneity
There is considerable data that demonstrates over all similarities in the frequencies of various units between samples from the same writer  , fmom different writers , and even from different languages .   1 The problem for statistical linguistics and stylistics is the ordering of degrees of similarity into groups according to some notion of homogeneity  . If the sample values differ no more than could reasonably be attributed to chance  , we seen or eason why the populations from which the samples were taken could not be called one homogeneous population  . 
Whether text samples pass a statistical test fom homogeneity depends on the nature of the text ~ the chosen iSee  , for example , Herdan , The Advanced Theoryo~f Language as Choice and Chance  , pp . i--7-/-27, and M . Rensk ~" The Noun-Verb Quotlent in Englxsh and Czech  , Phllolo ~ la Pra~ensla , 
VIII (1965), pp . 289-302.
-3-&-significance level , and the power of the test as determined by characteristics of the test itself in conjunction With the size of the sample  . It is possible to imagine a perfectly uniform text  , for example , one composed o?nothing more than repetitions of the same identical sentence  . 
In this case , a statistical test will reveal this homogen-eity for any significance level or sample size  . For real texts , though , the selection of thes . l . and s . s . poses a problem of practical and theoretical interest  . The danger is that an investigator will be tempted to make a flat statement concerning the homogeneity of a feature for a text or a genre  , when a slight change in s . l . or s . s . could have led to a reversal of that finding . Homogeneity , then , as a product of statistical hypothesis testing , should not be regarded as a function of the text alone  , but rather as a function of the text and the significance level and power associated with the test and the sample size  . If the samples represent different populations even if different only in some minimal way  , it is only a question of increasing sufficiently the sample size to cause the hypothesis of homogeneity to be rejected  . 
In discussing the size of samples to be taken , Herdan states that " for statistical investigations in general  , it is usually a question of how small the sample should be -- 
I for reasons of economy -- without becoming unrepresentative of the universe  , and without the errors acquiring such dimensions as to make significance testing illusory  . "22 Ibid . , p .   170   -4-q It is clear that hard infommation is needed on The extent to which parts of a single text will differ with respect to the frequency of various measured units  . IT is also clear that different units may occur with vamying degrees of consistency throughout a text  . The question of the homogeneity of a text is complex  . But until The nature of variation within texts is understood  , statements about variation between texts cannot be made with great authority  . 
The Design of the Study
A suitable model for the study of quantitative change in linguistic behavior is one which views change as taking place along dimensions  , such that if two texts vary significantly in the proportion or distribution of one or more units  , this difference would be attributed to the two texts occupying different positions in a context space  . The examination of other texts of varying similarity to each of the original two texts should lead to the description of factors  ( dimensions ) responsible for the original observed difference . The proposed dimensions can then be tested by predicting the behavior of texts not yet examined  . 
In this study we propose to examine some aspects of the statistical behavior of certain syntactic units in a sample of technical English  . In this as in any other study we must carefully set our goals and gather an appropriate  --5--h amount of data to carry them out . 
The major focus of this study will be on the varia-tion infrequency of syntactic units within the writing of two individuals  . A primary hypothesis to be tested is that the distributions of units will remain l ~ easonably the same throughout a single text written by one person  . 
If the distributions are not uniform ~ several explanations could be offered  . For example ~ the varying content could in f luence the frequencies  ; that is , even in a single text there might be contextual variations  . A comparison of the individual chapters should reveal such variations since the chapters represent the way in which the content has been divided in the text  . For this reason the chapters will be compared with each other in each of the two texts  . 
There may be other causes for internald if ferences in a text  . During the time that the text was written various circumstances could have a risento influence the frequencies  . This study does not attempt , however , to account for such influences except as they may be co~related with chapter content and position  . 
The other primary hypothesis to be tested is that the two sample texts will reveal essentially the same distributions  . Several studies have compared samples of technical writing a saw hole with samples of nontechnical 
I writing , but no one-seems to have reported on the varia-t ion in linguistic performance among individual American  --6--v-techn ical writers . 
In order to be sure that differences between the texts would be attributable as much as possible to the writers themselves it was decided to select the sample texts from the same discipline  . In other werds , if a history text differed in average sentence length from a biology text this cou ld be due either to the different write rs or the subject areas or beth  . While it may seem unreasonable to believe that biology and history writings could exhibit distinctive patterns  , there is also no inherent reason why technical and nontechnical should vary  . 
The texts selected for this study are both from linguistics  . They are : I . Emmon Bach's Introduction to Transformational Grammars New York  ,  1964) , all but exercises at the end of chapters . 
2 . Kenneth Pike's Language in Relation to a Unified The or Z of the Structure of Human Behavior  ( The Hague , f967) , pp . 25-82, excluding bibliographical sections . 
The choice of linguistics as the technical field was arbitrary  . These samples of technical writing cannot be regarded as-random samples of technical writing as a whole  , or even of linguistic writing , or even of Bach's or Pike's writing . The requirement of this study for large amounts of data from single texts precluded the possibility of gaining representativeness through the use of many smaller samples  . Factors leading to the selection of the particular text by Bach were its relative shortness as a complete  -7-book   , its recent publication date , and the varied material covered . The three chapters by Pike may be regarded as a smaller control sample to be available to confirm any major conclusions for the Bach sample  . Moreover , it was ? elt that Pike exhibited a rather different approach to sentence construction from Bach  , and that this difference , when demonstrated quantitatively , would dispel any notion that technical writers could not show individual styles  . For convenience the samples from Bach and Pike will be referred to hereafter as simply Bach and Pike  . 
Before conducting a statistical investigation of texts various parameters or units must be selected which later will be counted and used as the basis for determining the similarity of the samples to be compared  . The parameters discussed here represent 2 syntactic levels , that o?clause and sentence . Table 1 depicts the basic clause level units .

Sentence types are defined through constituent clause types  . A sentence is assumed to consist of a sequence of clauses  , each of which is either a main clause or a subordinate clause  . In the coded text symbols for main clauses are preceded by an " M "  . 
Further , some clauses will be embedded within another clause  . Embedded clauses appear in parentheses follow -ing the clause in which they are embedded  . Thus , those sentences which are composed of the same clauses in the same order are considered to be long to the same sentence type  . The following examples should clarify the clause and sentence type classifications : i  . Numerous examples and problems are presented throughout this introduction  . Bach , page 2 .

The coding of the original texts ' was carried out " manually  , " that is , no computer program was written to convert- I0-\ the source text to coded text . For each chapter (8 in Bach , 3 in Pike ) the occurrences or tokens of each of The clause and sentence Types were counted and compared  . The chi-square test was employed To determine the validity of the assumption that the chapters in each text can be regarded as random samples from one population  . 
The counting and statistical analysis was carried out through the facilities of the Michigan Terminal System at the University of Michigan Computing Center  . This time-sharing system is presently driven by two IBM System  /360-67 processors . The clause level unit analysis programs were written in assembly language and FORTRANIV  . The sen-Tence type counting was programmed in SNOBOL ~  . 
Results for Bach
Table 2 depicts the frequency counts of the five clause types in Bach  . Here considerable variation is apparent , especially in the be clause and the passive clause  . The there and i_~t clause frequencies appear to be relatively constrained  . The assumption that The chapters may be regarded as random samples from one population must be rejected  . 
The frequency of the most common sentence types in Bach is illustrated in Table  3  . The percentages given in the table represent the proportion of a sentence type among the five sentence Types listed  . It was expected that a few sentence types would occur quite often  , and that many Types would be found only once . It was disappointing , - ii-

-13-however , to find that only five types occummed with sufficient frequency fom statistical testing  . 
Theme is clearly little consistency in the frequency of these sentence types  , and the chi-squame test is able to meject strongly The hypothesis of homogeneity of the chaptems  . 
A cumsomy inspection of the table reveals little ovem all pattern  . The main passive Type ( MS ) occums least in chapters 1 and 8 , the introduction and the conclusion . This is consistent with the notion of the passive clause being highly comrelated with technical material  . Of course , the main passive type is not the only source of passive clauses  . 
The active plus subordinate passive type ( M45 ) listed in the table also pmovides one passive clause per sentence  . 
We find that this type has its lowest frequencies in chapters  4 and 7  . Theme is , then , no strong correlation between sentence types on the basis that they both contain passive clauses  . 
Bach and Pike Compared
Table 4 depicts the distmibution of clauses in Pike . 
As for Bach , the assumption that the chapters mepmesent random samples from one population must be mejected  . As in Bach , the passive vamies considerably fmom chaptem to chaptem  . Bach's fimst chaptem , the int moduction , has the
I smallest propomtion of passives but Pike's fimst chaptem has the most passives  . Bach's be clauses range fmom 15 . 8-14-percent to 30 . 5 percent , but Pike's be clauses are more stable , ranging from 16 . 1 percent to 22 . 4 percent . 
Pike's active and passive clauses are also more consistent  , but with eight chapters it must be taken into account that Bach has a greater opportunity to reveal in consistency  . 
Bach appears to use slightly more b__ee clauses , many fewer active clauses , and somewhat more passive and it clauses . 
The difference in the frequency of there clauses does not seem substantial  . A chi-square test comparing Bach's and Pike's clause totals yields a probability far less than  . 001 .

- 15-only a handful occurred with sufficient frequency in each chapter to allow statistical testing  , in spite of a sample of almost 2000 sentences . There are far fewer sen-Tences in the Pike sample of  446 sentences , and in addition Pike appears to use proport ionally more sentence Types due to his preference for sentences with four or more clauses  , copies of which are not likely to be found again  . It is not surprising , then , That just two or three sentence types occur often enough for Testing  . Rather than attempt any judgment on the consistency of Pike's sentence types on such meager evidence  , we proceed to a summary of the most frequent sentence types in Pike and Bach  . 
The results , given in Table 5 , clearly indicate the authors ' different preferences  , but at the same time theme are marked similar it ies in their frequency of usage of some types  , for example the M34 and M43 types . We must remember that Bach's most common sentence types were shown to be strongly non-homogeneous  , and thus the data in Table 5 cannot be regarded as highly predictive of the performance to be found in other Bach samples  . Because of this great internal in consistency a chi-square test was not carried out on the data in Table  5  . 


This study has produced , we believe , much useful and interesting data which leads to several major conclusions  -16-

-17-about the nature of language performance.
The first conclusion is that the model of a writer producing language by drawing samples of l inguistic units at random from a specific and unchanging population is untenable  . The evidence given here is strongly against such a model  , but it is not certain whether the difficulty with such a model is to be traced to non-random sampling from a constant population  , or random sampling from a changing population , or non-random sampling from a changing population  . Moreover , it is not clear how any one of the three alternat ive models could be demonstrated superior to any of the others  , since there seems to be no way to distinguish empirically between the effects of non-random sampling and a changing population  . 
The random sample-uniform population ( RSUP ) model for a single writer appears to be the foundation for many studies in statistical styl is tics and linguistics  , although this is often not expressed in any explicit way  . 
These studies are designed as follows . The hypothesis is that two or more writers or genres differ substantially in the use of one or more linguistic units such as sentence type  , sentence length , adjective-verb ratio , etc . Brinegar , for example , has stated this hypothesis in this way : The use of this method assumes that every author unconsciously uses  w6rds that , at least in the long run , could be considered as random drawings from a fixed frequency distribution of word lengths  . This should -18-be true at least for writings of a related type over a reasonable span of years  .   3 A null hypothesis of no significant difference ( homogeneity ) is tested through the drawing of random samples from the writers or genres and the selection of a statistical test and a significance level  . The sample sizes are chosen on the basis of their being large enough to be representative of the writers or genres  . The test is applied to the sample data and the null hypothesis is either maintained or rejected  . Thus homogeneity is a black or white proposition in This approach  , a function of the vagueness of sample size and significance level  . 
The RSUP model interprets the discovery of a statis-tically " significant " difference between writers or genres as something unexpected and hence worthy of note  , meaning that the writers or genres represent dist inct populations  . Yet , the demonstration of statistically sign if icant differences is something to be expected with a sufficiently large sample size  . What is needed is an approach which takes sample size out of immediate consi-deration and relat ivizes the concept of homogeneity  .

- 19-of the homogeneity of linguistic units as something absolute  . There is nothing intuitively objectionable about a statement that one feature is more or less consistent than another  . 
This study is not the first , of course , To use large enough sample sizes within a genre to demonstrate very significant internal differences  . A recent analysis of some aspects of the Brown University corpus reveals such differences within fifteen genres for parts of the sentence length distribution in words  , using the chi-square test . 
There was no attempt to relativize the results of the chi-square test  , but sentence length was described for each genre in terms of The mean  , standard deviation , and coefficient of variation , the latter being the standard deviation divided by the mean  , a measure better suited than the standard deviation alone to indicate the extent of dispersion in the distribution  . 
An investigation of The homogeneity of individual vocabulary items between genres revealed once again very significant differences  .   5 Rather than settle for a state-Henry Kucera and W  . Nelson Francls , Computational Analysis of Present-Day American English  ( Providence , RfI . : Brown University Press , 1957),, pp .  378-379 . 
5Ibid . , pp .   277-293~   -20-menT that certain words were found to be non -homogeneous in the corpus at certain sample sizes  , Mosteller proposes an " index of contextuality " as a measure of relative consistency for a specific word  .   6 This index is computed by dividing the chi-square value by The sample size and then multiplying by  i000  . The effeoT is To treat each sample as if it consisted of exactly  i000 units ~ and the resulting index can be used to rank The homogeneity of individual words  . In This fashion Mosteller computes indexes of 6 . 2, 6 . 9, and 9 . 6 for to , and , and the , which were the least contextual ~ or least influenced in frequency by context  , in the Brown corpus . 
The second major conclusion of this study is that an index like Mosteller's is an appropriate way % otreat homogeneity in a corpus  . Using this approach to study different writers one would segment each writer's works into n segments  , Take random samples , preferably of equal size , from each of the segments and compute an index of contextuality for each feature measured  . If there is a central tendency in a feature for the w~iters ~ an index of contextuality for pairs of writers considered Together may be computed as a measure of Their variance  .

- 21-supposes a consistent number of segments and data divisions  ( parts of speech , sentence length g moupings , etc . ) , since these lead to the degrees of freedom of the contingency table  , and for a greater number of degrees of freedom a greater chi-square value is expected for a given deviation from randomness  . Nevertheless , for purposes of rough comparison one may wish to examine the homogeneity of features with different underlying degrees of freedom  . Another index should be of interest in this regard : the sample size necessary to reject the null hypothesis at a level of  . 001 . This index is in a way more concrete than the index of contextuality in that The degree of consistency is related to the number of units being measured  . More important , the degrees of freedom is taken into account . 
For the index of contextuality a higher value means less uniformity for the feature  , while a higher value for the rejection size means more uniformity  . 
Table 6 gives values for these two indexes for a number of features as a basis for determining The relative similarity of Bach and Pike  . As can be seen , the two writers agree relatively closely on the ratio of main to subordinate clauses of the passive type  , but differ greatly on this same ratio for the there type  . ,  -22-We believe that the categomization of clause and sentence types used here is reasonable and simple  , and that this sort of categomization would be readily applicable to other languages  . In addition , statistical measures such as the index of contextuality and rejection size appear to be quite useful as indicators of the consistency of linguistic performance  .
