A CYK-table-driven interactive relaxation parsing method of spoken Korean  , integrated with the CYK-based morphological analysis is introduced  . An extension of the Categorial Grammar is introduced to treat the fieeword-order in Korean  . The table-driven control of interactive relaxation gives efficiency in constituent searching and expectation generation  . ' File lexical nature of the Categorial Grammar and the distributed nature of the interactive relaxation parsing together show a smooth integration of both bottom-up and to F down effects during the spoken language analysis  . 
1. Introduction
Spoken language input may be one of the most preferred interface with computer systems if speech can be well integrated with the natural language processing  . 
There have been a few attempts to integrate speech recognition with Ihenatural language understanding  .   ( Hayes 1986 ) adopted the case frame instantiation technique to parse continuously spoken English sentences given in the form of a word lattice  ( a set of word candidates hypothesized by a speech recognition module  ) and t ) roduced a frame representation of the tlt terence  . 
(Pocsio 1987 ) suggested a modified case framc parsing to parse a word lat lice in Italian  . ( Lee ,, L . 
S .  1987 ) developed a prototype Chinese ( Mandarin ) dictation machine which takes a syllable lattice and produces a Chinese character sequence  .   ( Saito 1991 ) used GLR technique to parse a sequence of Japanese phonenms and  , integrated wilh the tlMM technique , developed a
HMM-I . R parser ( Kita 1991).
lh ) wever , spoken Korean has many distinguished characteristics compared with spoken English and even with spoken Japanese  , for example , comlpe ? word formation , phonological changes and irregular conjugations . 
In this paper , we present a CYK-table driven interactive relaxation parsing method of spoken 
Korean , integrated with the CYK-based in or phological analysis  . A Korean phoneme lattice is assumed as input and the CYK-based morphological analysis copes with the difficulties of complex word formation  , phonological changes and irregular conjugations . Categorial Gralnmar is adapted and extended to treat the free word-order in Korean and the CYK -tablcdriven interactive relaxation parsing gives et ' ficicn cy beyond the general interactive relaxation parsing methods such as  ( Howcllst 988 ; Nijholt 1990) . 
2. Features of spoken Korean
Korean , a SOV and an agghmating language , has the following characteristics : 1 ) A Korean word , Eojeol , consists of more than onen tor phemes with clear cut boundaries in between  . For example , an Eojeol " pka . il-dul-ul(fiies\[objl)"consists of 3 , norl ~ hemes : pha-il = il + dul + ul filcs lobjl file\[pl  . suffix \]\ [ objmarkerl2 ) Korean is a postposifional language with noun -endings  , verb-endings and prefinal verb-endings . 
These functional morphemes determine the noun's case role  , verb's tense , modality , and modification relations between phrases . For example , in " e-ceypha-il ( the file : i ~: ~:: . :, . 
: : ~ ii ! ~ i : ~ : ~ yesterday ) "the verb " swu-ceng ( edit ) " is of past tense and modifies " phail ( file ) ": su-ceng-hayes stenpha-iledit\[past\]\[ adnominal \] file  3  ) Korean has relatively fi'ce word order compared to SVO hmguages  , such as English . For example , the sentence ~~ ~- ha-vess-tenpha-il-tu l-ul/tn ~ pok-sa-ha ye-la  ( Copy the files that was edited by me yester day to /trap  . ) " may be written as " e-cey . na ! ~ dcaswu-cen ~ ess-ten " or "~10 e-cey_naok-kaswu-cen , -hgzhaeyess-ten . .,  . " spoken Korean has the following more characteristics :  4  ) The unit of pause in a speech ( Eonjeol ) may be different from that of a written text ( Eojeol )  . For example , in speaking " nay-kae-ceys wu-ceng-ha-yess-ten phaoil-tul-ul ~ traplopok-sa-ha-ye-la  ( spaces delimit Eojeols )  , a person may pause after " nay-ka " and after " e -ceys wu-ceng-ha-yess-tenpha-il-tul-ul " and after " ~ traplopok-sa-ha-ye-la  . "5) Phonological changes occur in a morpheme , between morphemes in an Eojeol , and between Eojeols in an Eonjeol . These changes include assimilation , dissimilation , and contraction . For example , a morpheme " pok-sa " is pronounced as/pok-ssa / and " yess " is pronounced as/yet /  . An Eojeol " su-ceng-ha-yes s-ten " is pronounced as/su-ceng-ha-yet-tten /  . 
3 . Table driven neural syntactic analysis This section explains interactive relaxation parsing of spoken Korean using neural network  , its underly in grammar , and control mechanism . 
A sequence of candidate phonemes in phoneme lattice\[figure  1\] is assumed to be the output of the speech recognizer  . 
\[ Figure 1. Phoneme lattice \]
A CYK-based morphological analyzer is used to extract a morpheme lattice from the phoneme lattice  . In the morphological analysis , special procedural attachments resolve the phonological changes  . The use of phoneme lattice gives the problem of exponential number of E on jeol candidates  . For this problem , tried at a structure is used for the phonetic transcription-to-orthographic morpheme dictionary  ( morpheme-level phonetic dictionary )  . 
3.1. Extending the Categorial Grammar
To model the syntax of Korean , we extended the Categorial Grammar in two ways ( Zeevat 1988 ; Uszkoreit 1986) . 
A ( directional ) Categorial Grammar is an ordered quintuple G = < V  , C , S , R , f > , where 1) V : the vocabulary set ,  2 ) C : a finite set of basic categories which generates a full set C'of categories via recursive application of the following category furmation rules : if a ~ C  , then a ~ C ' and if a ~ C ' and b~C' , then a/b ~ C ' and a kbcC ' , 3) S : the category for sentences ,  4 ) R : a set of functional application rules such as left cancellation ? A B\A__>Bright cancellation " B/AA_  . > B5 ) f : an assignment flmction from elements of V into the subsets of C'  . 
To treat the free word-order in Korean , we extended the category formation rules and the application rules :  2'  ) Extended category formation rules : if a ~ C , then a ~ C ' and if a ~ C ' and ScC ' , then a/s ~ C ' and a ~ C ' and 4' ) Extended functional application rules : left cancellation : A iI ~ AI  ,  . . . , An->~Al, . . . ,Ai-l,Ai+l, . . . , Atlright cancellation : B/AI, . . . , An Ai-->B/AI, . . . , Ai_l , Ai+l, . . . , An 3 . 2 . Interactive relaxation parsing ( Howells 1988 ) developed an interactive relaxation parsing method which used a dynamic network building scheme  , and decay over time with competition instead of explicit inhibitory links  , which is similar to the ( Reggia 1987)'s approach . 
The interactive relaxation algorithm consists of the following steps  ( Howells 1988 ) : 1 ) add nodes , 2) spread actiwltion and 3) decay . Bottom-up information gathering and topdown expectations occur during the parsing  . 
1) to add a node:
A grammar node is added to t " each sense of morphemes when the parsing begins  . Statistical information on the senses of a morpheme determines the initial activation value of the senses  . 
A grammar node which has more activation than the predefined threshold  6  ) makes new nodes ( expectations )  . The newly generated nodes represent candidate parse trees containing the generator node  . 
9122) to spread actiwltion:
A predefined portion , P , of a node's total activation , A , is passed upward , to bigger parse trees . When more than one destination odes exist , they compete to get more actiwt tions . A higher node with actiwltion aigets the following amount of actiw ~ tions :  . 2 ~11
AxP xg ~ aJz
A higher level node ( with total actiwltion A ) spreads a prc defined portion ( Q ) of its actiwltion w due equally to the constituents  . When there are n constituents , a constituent gets the following amount o1' activations : n 3  ) to decay : AllO de's actiwt tion value ( A ) after decay is A times ( 1D )  , where I ) is the decay ratio . 
Moreover , a node with less constituents than needed is penalized by the number of actual constituents  ( Ca ) divided by the numher of required constituents ( Cr )  . After all , a node's activation value changed to

Ax(11)) x--

And finally a node whose actiwttion value is less than the predefmed threshold ? is removed  . 
3.3. CYK-table-driven control
The interactive relaxation parsing scheme ( Howells 1988 ) lacks efficient control structures for const ituent searching and expectation generation  . We provided the positional information through the CYK-tablc and the structuring information through the Categorial Grammar formalism  . Using Categorial Grammar makes the parse tree be a binary tree  , not a general nary tree . 
All the grammar nodes reside in a CYK-table.
The position ( i , j ) in the table explicitly says where to find the constituents  , where to add new expectations and what the uode the restands for  . 
A node in CYK(i , j ) represents a parse tree for the input segmeut from i to j  . A node in CYK(i , j ) with category P , called P ( i , j ) , can bensed in 3 ways to construct larger parse trees : 1  ) Q/p ( k , i-l)P ( i , j ) --> Q(k , j ) or
P ( i , j)Q~p(j + l , k)-->Q(i , k).
P(i , j ) combins with Q/p(k , i-l ) for some k < i and becomes a constituent of Q ( k , j ) . Orit combins with Q\p(j + l , k ) for some k > j and becomes a constituent of Q ( i , k ) . In these two cases P ( i , j ) is used as an argument of the limctional categories  . 
2) A/B(i , j ) B0+l , k)-->A(i , k).
P(i , j ) combines B(j + l , k ) for some k > j and creates a larger parse tree A ( i , k ) , when P = A/B . In this case , P ( i , j ) is a flmctional category A/B and searchest i ) ran argument B on the right side . 
3)B(k,i-1)AkB(i , j)-->A(k,j).
P(i , j ) combines B(k , i-l ) for some k < i and creates A(k , j ) , when P = A\B . In this case , P ( i , j ) is a functional category A\B and searches for an argument B on the left side  . 
01234\[ Figure 2 . A/B(l , l ) 's expectation generation \] The following scenarios can explain the CYK-table driven interactive relaxation parsing of 

A node A/B ( i , j ) whose actiwltion w due is greater than the threshold  ( 0 makes new nodes ( A ( i , k )' s for all j < k < input-length) , and each A(i , k ) looks for a constituent B(j + l , k ) . \[ Figure 2\] shows A/B ( I , I )' s expectation generations . There are 3 possible A's which can have A/B (1 , 1) as their constituents : A(I , 2) , A(I , 3) and A(1 , 4) . A(I , 2) looks for 1/(2 , 2) , A(I , 3) for B(2 , 3) , and A(1 , 4) for B(2 , 4) . 
Synnnetrically , a node A\B ( i , j ) whose activation value is greater than the threshold O makes new nodes  ( A ( k , j )' s for all 0 < k < i ) and each A(k , j ) looks for a constituent B(k , i-l) . 
Only the nodes with enough actiw ~ tions generate hypotheses  , and the hypotheses which lack of constituents disappear rapidly by the decay with penalty mechanism  . Each node ( hypothesis ) which looks for a constituent drives searching is guaranteed by the CYK-table  . We call the parsing technique as Connectionist -CYK parsing  . 
4. System architecture
The Connectionist-CYK parser is incorporated into the DINX  ( Dialog Interface to UNIX ) system which is under development in POSTECH ( Lee , W . I . and Lee , G . B .  1993) . \[ Figure 3\] shows the part of D1NX system architecture . There are two modules in the system ( for language analysis ) : morphological nalyzer and the CCYK parser .

Morpheme lattice \] Figure 3 . Speech parser architecture \] A phoneme lattice for each E on jeol is analyzed by an extension of the CYK-based morphological analyzer  ( Lee , E . C .  1992) . The result of the analysis is a morpheme lattice ( see\[Figure 4\] ) for each Eonjeol . These morpheme lattices are linked , and the morpheme lattice for entire sentence is constructed  . Grammar nodes for the senses of each morpheme are created in the CYK-table and the following four steps are repeated for a fixed number of iterations :  1  ) making hypotheses ( new nodes )  , 2) constituent searching ,  3 ) computing outgoing activations and 4 ) updating activation values . Functional category nodes A/B(i , j ) and A\B(i , j ) whose activation values are greater than the threshold generate the expectations A  ( i , k )' s and A(k , j )' s respectively . All the hypotheses ( nodes which lack of a constituent ) search for their constituents . Outgoing bottom-up and topdown activations are computed for each node  . Each node gathers incoming activations and decays . 
5. Sample run
In this section , a detailed example of the Connectionist-CYK parsing is given  . The system parameters are as follows : bottom-up activation ratio P =  0  . 87, topdown activation ratio Q = 0 . 39, decay ratio D = 0 . 495, expectation threshold ? = 6 . 66 and remove threshold ? = 0 . 66 . 
The sentence " ci-wulsuiss-nunpha-il-dul-ulpo - ye-la  ( List the files which can be removed . )" is assumed to be spoken with two pauses , " ci-wulsuiss-nun/pha-il-dul-ul/po-ye-la . "\] Figure 1\] showed the first phoneme lattice of the three . 
The phoneme lattices are analyzed one by one , and a morpheme lattice for the sentence is created by merging the morpheme lattice for each 
Eonjeol \] Figure 4\].

Grammar nodes for the senses morpheme are created \[ Figure  5   ( a ) \] .

The morpheme lattice is embedded in the CYK -table  , and the senses of each morpheme are created in the corresponding position in the table  . Each nod c with functional category generates hypotheses  , and each hypothesis searches for thcir constituents  . After the 1st iteration , 209 nodes are in the table . The number of nodes change to 282 ,  302 ,  289 , and 265 along the iterations . After 6th iteration , the number of nodes decreases to 253 , and the correct parse tree for the whole morpheme lattic c is created  ( \[ Figure 5 ( b ) \] shows a part of the parse tree )  . After the 7th iteration , the number of nodes decreases 191 ,  180 ,  163 ,  103 ,  98  .   .   .   .   .  78 .

6. Conclusions and future works
In this paper we have developed a CYK-table-driven interactive relaxation parsing method  ( CCYK parsing ) of spoken Korean , integrated with the CYK-based morphological nalysis  . 
We have shown that the partially free word order and the postpositions are easily and naturally encoded by the Extended Categorial Grammar  . The use of Categorial Grammar with the interactive relaxation parsing results in a lexical-based  , locally distributed and island-driven parsing . A node generates hypotheses if it gathers enough bottom-up activation  ( evidence ) and each hypothesis locally searches for constituents  , l ) ecay with penalty removes failed and incorrect hypotheses  . 
The use of the phoneme lattice and the morpheme lattice removes the redundancy in postprocessing and parsing of spoken Korean  , and makes the whole interactions among the phonemes and morphemes possible  . The activation value of parses gives a clue to the selection of the best parse  . The statistical information between senses of morphemes can make the selection more reliable  . As noted in ( Howells 1988) , changing the system parameters gives the flexibility of retaining the alternatives  . 
We can have all the parses in one setting and can have only the best parse on the another setting depending on the application  . We plan to add the unification ability for semantic analysis to our work  , and finally develop a connectionist parsing method for the full Categorial Unification
