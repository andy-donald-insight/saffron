The model underlying text coherence parsing formalizes hither to entirely intuitive text linguistic notions whose origin can be traced back to Danes's work on thematic progression patle HlS  . 
1 INTRODUCTION l ) ufing tim last years it has become increasingly apparent that dialog and text understanding systems must account I or connectivity relations that extend over sentence boundaries  . This has led tnabulk of work dealing with varinus forms of cohesimt-preserving language mechanisms  , lnainly in the field of anaphora , which contribute to connectivity among sentences . 
From the focus on these linguistic phenomena one might obtain a misleading picture of textual connectivity  , viz . one that considers it basically asa'fiat' , continuous treanl of formally connected utterances lacking additional structure  . Farless research as been devnted to the intemM organization of cohesive utteranccs by mechanisms at a more global level of dialog/text architecture  , the level of text coherence . 
Major computational pproaches r clated to co-.
herence aspects within a dialog processing framework am due to Reichman's  \[1978\]  , McK cown's \[19851 and Scha & Polmlyi's \[19881 lbnnalizations of diatog grammars .

This coincides with the generality of use of most coherence relations  , but is in sharp contrast to the highly constrained and domain-depend-ent model of superstructures and story grammars  . 
(4 ) Major thematic progression pattems are correlated with particular search styles and retrieval modes in fulltext information systems  . Hence , providing typed coherence operators inherently supports graphics-based user interactions with the TOPIC system in terms of advanced conceptual orientation and navigation tools for semantically guided text graph tours  ( see section 5 . 3) . 
(5 ) The investigation of thematic progression pattems is of value in its own methodological right  . They constitute a basic structural model of text macro organization as opposed to model theoretic and plan/goal-based approaches  ( a distinction made by Pustejovsky\[1987\] )  . 
As such they might complement current ext understanding methodologies whose emphasis  , of ar , has been on fairly knowledge-expensive assertional models  ( such as coherence relations and text macro propositions  ) or stereotyped text-semantical models ( such as superstructures and story grammars )  . 
2 MOTIVATING THENEED FOR TEXT
COHERENCE PARSING
T be model of text structure parsing we propose draws a careful distinction between text cohesion and text coherence phenomena  . As to the illustration of text cohesion mechatfisms in natural language texts  , consider the following text passage : \[1\] The De/taX from Zeta Machines lnc . is a computer system that mnsUnixV . 3 . 
\[21 ~ h.e_Lw\[9~ is based on a 68020 processor.
\ [3\] It has a 12-inch monochromed is play and an integrated telephone hand set and builtin modem  . 
\[4\] Internally , there's a 40-megabyte hard disk , a1 . 2-megabyte51/4-inch floppy disk drive , 4 . 5 megabytes of RAM , three RS-232 Cports , and an ST-506 port . 
Repeated occurrences of various text cohesion phenomena are illustrated by nominal anaphora  ( 7" he system ' in \[2\] )  , pronominal naphora ('/ t'in\[3\]) , both referring to the unique antecedent Delta-X ( in\[1\] )  , while '/ n-ternally , there's a . . . hard disk " ( in\[4\] ) is linked to Delta-X via textual ellipsis . The basic cohesion among these sentences yields the common thematic background for constantly elaborating on a single topic  ( Delta-X )  . An appropriate text parser should , first of all , recognize these multiple cohesion phenomena and produce something like the following representation structures  ( indicated by \[ . . . \] R ) : II\]Rl ) elta-X < manufacturer : ZetaMachinesInc . > Delta-X < operating system : Unix V , 3  >  \[21R Delta-X < CPU: 68020   >  13R Delta-X < peripheral devices: 12-inch monochrome display > Delta + X < peripheral devices : telephune hand set\]>Delta-X < e ~tmunication devices : modem >  14\]R Delta-X < external storage devices : 40-megabyte hard disk >
Delta-X < external storage devices : 1 . 2-megabyte 51/4-inch floppy disk drive > Delta-X < main memory: 4  . 5 megabytes of RAM >
Deha-X < ports:3RS-232Cports >
Deha-X < ports : ST-506port >
A c'r ~ ! s DECOLING-92 , NArcl'l~s ,   2328 AoC-r 1992   26 What is still lacking is a representation facility which characterizes this sequence of single assertions constantly referring to a single topic  ( Delta-X ) as constituting a coherent whole . Recognizing linguistic forms of text coherency and providing appropriate thematic grouping operators for text knowledge bases is what text coherence parsing mainly is about  . Even if parsers would perfectly recognize and normalize all occurrences of text cohesion phenomena in texts  , missing recognition capabilities for text coherence phenomena would nevertheless produce under-structured  , incoherent text knowledge bases in the sense that global pragmatic n-dicatops of discourse bracketing would be lacking  . 
3 BASICTEXT COHERENCE PATTERNS
In this section , we informally describe the basic patterns of text coherence focused on in this paper  . According to Danes \[1974\] three categories of thematic developments can be distinguished :  ~1 Constant Theme . This pattern is characterized by the con . ~tant elaboration of one specific topic within a text  ( passage ) by considering several of its conceptual facets . The following two paragraphs serve to illustrate this major pattern of thematic progression  ( the reference points to the constant theme ( Delta-
X ) are indicated by italics ) :\[ TI . ll . The Delta-X from Zeta Machines lnc . is a multiuser , multitasking computer system that runs Unix V . 3 and comes complete with most of the software needed for business applications  . The combination host computer/workstation is based on a  68020 processor , with dual 68000 processors providing peripheral processing . It has a 12-inch monochromed is play and an integrated telephone hand set and builtin modem  . 
Internally , there's a 40-megabyte hard disk , a1 . 2-megabyte51/4-inch floppy disk drive , 4 . 5 megabytes of RAM , a network controller , three RS-232 Cports , and an ST-506 port . 
7\] Continuous Thematization of Rhemes . In contrast to constant themes , this pattern realizes a continuou shift of topics  ( visualized by bold italics )  . The proces starts with a theme and , some comment on that theme which we shall call theme  ( actu-?ally , an elaboration on one of its conceptual facets ) . 
Now this rheme is focused on as the next theme that is elaborated by a corresponding rheme  , etc . : IT 1 . 2\] . The $12 , 0 00 Delta-X host/work station can be supplied from Zeta Machines Inc  . . 2999 State St . , Santa Barbara , CA 93105 . Zeta-Machines " sales manager , Brian Wilson , says that hey also plan to market the Gamma-Z , a CAD/CAM workstation based on a Connection Machine architecture  . The underlying theoretical foundations are due to D  . Hillis , a former M . I . T . student who first developed an experimental prototype based on connectionist principles  . 
Derived Theme . Global text structure can also be introduced by a variety of topics which share conceptual commonalities  ( facets ) at the knowledge rep-re Sell tation level ( not necessarily need this be paral-leled with properties actually mentioned in the text !  ) without he general concept being explicitly stated in the text  . Technically this is realized by a set of sub -PROC  . Cq:COLING-92, NANTES , AUG .  2328 , 1992 ordinates or instances of a common ( only implicit ) supcrordinate/prototype . Suppose thei Uuslrative text ITI\]composed of its two constituent parts from above  , \[ T1 . 1\] and\[T1 . 2\] , is augmented by ~ vel~d paragraphs dealing with Gamma-Z and Sigma-P machines on a similar level of detail as those pas-sage swl fich cor ~sider the Delta-Xin\[TII :\[  T21  . The Deltao X from Zeta Machines . . .  \[1'1 . I~TI . 2\] The Gamma-Z is a MS-DOS machine . Peripheral devices include an 8- inch color display , at marix printer , and a key &) ard . . . .
The Sigma-P system makes available a lot of desirable applications z~ftw are such as ack ~tatnt~e  , ~ stem , word processing , and a variety of games .   .   .   . 
This text implicitly has workstation as a derived lhem c  , since that is the immediate prototype concept of those three instauees  ( Delta-X , Gamma-Z , Sigma-P ) explicitly menlioned in \[ T2\] . 
4 TIlEKNOWLEDGESOURCES
INVOINED INTEXTPARSING
This section deals with the . knowledge sources involved in actually parsing a text  . Basically ( see Figure 1) , these are constituted by the PARSEBULLETIN , a black-board-type memory which records the single events of the parsing process  , the DOMAINK NOWLED GEBASE , which contains file domain-specific background knowledge needed for the parse  , and various EXPER~Ps for actually driving the parse through the text grammar specifications they incorporate  ( cf . tlahn \[1990\] for a more comprehensive presentation )  . 
The PARSEBULLETIN has a flat list struc.
ture . It records the sequence of text tokens as they appear in the text and  , if relevant ( see below ) , notes their class identifiers ( FRAME item , ADJective , etc . ) . More iml xmant , cox ~ structiv c parsing activities based on operations of the knowledge base and the parser are indicated at ~ ver '  , d positions ( socalled parse points ) in the PARSEBULLETIN . The type of operation being performed is indicated by a particular parse descriptor  . 
Some are internal to the management of the knowledge base  , e . g . , DEFACF ( default concept activation ) , while others indicate grammatical relations recognized by tile parser  , such as NounA'Vl ' ( conccptu ~ dattribution relations between ouns )  , AdjA'FI' ( conceptual ttribution relations between adjectives and nouns  )  . The items al Zl cct cd by an operation lorm a socalled parsemple  . 
The parser does not consider every token it receives from the input text at the same level of detail  . 
Instead , it distinguishes between words which amsig -nilicant to its performance  ( conceptually relevant ones , such as nouns or arl jcctives which denote concepts in the domain knowledge base  , or linguistically relevant ones , such as negation particles , certain conjtmctions , quantiliers , etc . ) , and tho ~ that are not ( an rong them a wide variety of semantically in different nouns  , verbs , particles , etc . , each of which is assigned the class identifier NIL  )  . The latter are simply discarded from further analysis  , while the fom ~ erarc assigned lexicalized grammar spc cifica fiorts  . The parser h~s thus been tuned towards partial parsing in a spirit similar to that advocated by Schankctal  .   \[19801 and achieves text understanding primarily on a terminological levcl of knowl-cdge representation  .

The DOMAINK NOWLED GEBASE ( KB for shoo ) contains frame representation structures . 
E ~: h frame identifier ( in boldface ) is assigned a list of slots ( enclo ~ d by a ngular brackets )  . ThemsioLs are associated with two different kinds of slot fillers  .

In addition , each concept has attached to it an a . ' ~ tivation weight counter . The values of the weight fac ~\ [ ors are enclosed by vertical bars attached to each item  ; if no bars explicitly occur , a zero weight is assumed . 
Activation weights arc incremented ( starting from zero-level activation ) whenever a noun denoting its associated concept occurs in the text  , and whenever structure-building operations in KB aflect that concept  .

Theme Pattern 5 . 2 Remarks on Continuous Thematization of Rhemes and Derived Theme Similarily  , formal descriptions have been worked out for the other two basic text coherence patterns mention -ed above  . Instead of a full treatment , we give two rather informal sketches of the underlying regularities as they have been incorporated into our framework  . Contitm-ous the matization of rhemes most significantly departs from the constant theme schema just outlined  ( in fact , both are mutually exclusive ) in that the former incorporates a continuous shift of the topics being considered  . 
Figure 4 illustrates this permanent change of issues in a text  . The PARSEBULLETIN contains a sequence of local theme-theme pairs with frame T i being tile current local theme and slotftller Tibeing its associated local rheme  . Text coherence is due to the fact that the current local theme  ( slot filler Ti ) becomes the next local theme ( framerl + l )  . This rheme-specific connectivity criterion is stressed by the double-sided black arrows in the DOMAINKNOWLEDGEBASE which link the immediately preceding theme to its identical theme succes -Acrl~  . s DECOLl NG-92 , NAM'ES , 2328 ho~r199230s or , while local theme-theme connections are indicated by the one-sided grey arrows which gol ~ om the local theme to its associated local tl~eme  . A sequence of local theme-theme pairs fulfilling the rheme-specilic conuec-tivity criterion in terms of overlapping palm neters  ( current rheme becomes next theme ) constitutes what is Item called continuous the matization of rhemes  , i . e . ag/oba / theme-theme cluster .

Gamraa-Z-architecture-Conn . Machine architecture , Conn . Machine architecture-developer-D . Hillis The third pattern further generalizes the results of the afore-going coherence computations on the paragraph level and extends them over various  ( adjacent ) paragraphs and possibly over the whole text . Consider a series of paragraphs , each one dealing exclusively with one special topic  ( see Figure 5 below )  . The first paragraph deals with frame T1 , tile second one elaborates on frame T2 , etc . A derived theme can be computed when all these different  ( sub ) topics all be linked to the most specific general ( super ) topic ( frame T )  . In technical terms , these subtopics are all instances of that Ptu ) c , ov COLING-92 , NANTES , AUG . 2328, 1992 supertopic . Text\[ T2\] illustrates Ot is pllenomenon : there are three paragraphs whose major topics arc Delta-X  , Gamma-Z , and Sigma-P ; a conceptual generalization step links them to the derived theme work  , s ' tation . In Figure 5 this relationship is indicated by th carrows pointing fi'o meach subtopic  ( of a single paragrapt t ) to its supertopic , thematically characterizing these paragraphs on a more general evel of conceptualization  .

Evidence for this comes from our experiments with TOPOGRAPHIC  , an interactive graphical interface to TOPIC's text knowledge ba~s\[Thiel&Hamm whhner  1987\]  . In particular , we observed a close funclional relationship between the selection of particular coherence patterns and particular search states during the retrieval process which is performed on network representations of text summaries  , so called text grapt Ls : 1 ) Constant Theme coherently characterizes a vari-et y of facts related to one particular topic  . A CT-based search operation enhances the user ~ knowledge of that topic by presenting facets  ( or data related to those facets ) the user is probably not aware of , although they may be relevan to the solution of his or her problem  .

6 FINAl , REMARKS
In this paper , a structural model of text coherence com ~ putation has been proposed that strongly exploits the knowledge chunking inherent to fi~ame representations  . 
These prc compiled knowledge structures are irt stantiat-cd by the topical evolution of a text ax represented in the parser's bullet in  . Tiros , various coherence phenomemt can be distinguished by particular instantiation pattents :  f3 constant theme is defined by multiple instantia -fions of aggregatiou  ( or conceptual association ) relations for one particular f'r' , une item in KB ; ffl continuous the matization of rhemes is deiino ed by multiple instantiations of aggregation relations for continuously changing  , though locally overlapping frame items in KB ; \[-J derived theme is defined by multiple instantiations of generalization/classilication relations holding between subparts of a frame hierarchy in KB  . 
A more elaborated formal description of this model-int : lnding those parts which could only be treated rather sketchily in this cont ribution - is given in llal m\  [1991\]   . The parser is currently running on SUN SPARC Stations under Unix  ( SUNOSV 4 . 1A ) . 
The functionality described in this paper is fully operational and part of the TOPIC text unders tanding system  .
