This paper discusses an innovative approach to knowledge based Machine Aided Translation  ( MAT ) where the translator is supported by an user -friendly environment providing linguistic and domain knowledge explanations  . Our project aims at integration of a Knowledge Base  ( KB ) in a MAT system and studies the integration principles as well as the internal interface between language and knowledge  . The paper present some related work , rel ~ ) rts the solutions applied in our project and tries to gene-raiize our evaluation of the selected MAT approach  . 
1. Introduction
The notion of MAT comprises approaches where-in contrast o MT-the human user keeps the initiative in translation  . MAT ranges between intelligent exteditors and work benches aiming at user modelling and partial MT  . A principal problem , however , is the support of domain knowledge since it affects the quality of the translated text  . Moreover , the time spent for domain familiarization is estimated as  3040% of the total translation time ( KiWi 90 )  . 
This paper discusses an innovative approach to knowledge based MAT : a KB is systematically integrated in a fr  , ' unework providing linguistic as well as domain knowledge support  . I , inguistic support is assured by relevant resources : gl '  , ' unmatic ~ d and lexical data . Domain expl~mations are generated from a KB of Conceptual Graphs  ( CGs )   ( Sow 84 )  . The system interface offers a standardialog : while translating  , the user highlights words/texts , chooses queries from menus and receives NL answers from where new reqnests can be started  . The results reported here were achieved in the joint Germ  , m-Bulgarian project DB-
MAT2(vHa91, vHAn94).
Depending on the viewpoint , DB-MAT can be compared to various approaches and /or systems :  ( i ) encoding of term's meaning :- to lexicons and tennbanks  ( see 2 . 1) and knowledge based term banks ( see 2 . 2) ;   ( ii ) generation of explanations allowing follow up questions and cl  , ' u ' ifications - e . g . IDAS ( see 2 . 3); ( iii ) NL generation from CGs ( Bon 96 , AnBo96) . 
Below we present related approaches and the DB-MAT paradigm  . Our opinion about he costs and be-nefits of the knowledge based MAT is clearly stated  .

Related Work Some approaches , are now discussed with comments on file rationale of a knowledge based MAT design  . 
2.1. Lexicons and Termbanks
Ill ( machine-readable ) terminological lexicons domain knowledge is contained in text definitions  . A concep-tu , 'd hierarchy is sometimes sketched by pointers like " see  . ." in the definition : the super - and sister-con -cepts  , are related to the lexic ~ d entry , i . e . to the denoted concept . An intuitive unification of the lexical units and their implicit knowledge items is assumed  . 
Concept-oriented term bank support a hierarchical skeleton of underlying concepts and thus the knowledge cm~be treated fonnalty during its construction  , use and up & lting . Text definitions , however , are written mmmally ; the progress is that the lexical entries and concept md elements are encoded independently  . In monolingual tcnnbanks , the tennis a concept label as well as a lexicon item  ( e . g . Co , ' Mn 93) . In cases of bilingualism ( e . g . F is 93 ) every NL has its own conceptual structure and translation equivalents are mappings of one concept md structure onto another  . 
An evaluation for " domain lolow ledge in translation " reveals knowledge content  , organization , ' rodusage : ( 1 ) conceptual knowledge is encoded in text definitions  , written manually in multilingual environment . Domain facts are not included in any definition although they  , are very important for the understanding of technical texts  ; (2) knowledge is artifici , ' dly segmented into text fragments , organized alphabetically around lexical entries . The thne-consu-ruing search for semantically related terms is to be performed by the reader  ;   ( 3 ) the user gets the whole bulk of inlormation without any opportunity to filter for relevant aspects  . The " inheritance of features " ~ dong the hierarchy is to be made by the reader  . 
2.2. Terminological Knowledge Bases
The term meanings are encoded in form a languages instead of text definitions  . Briefly we mention: ( 1 ) COGNITERM ( MSBE92 ) : the term meaning is represented in a frmne-like structure which is accessible by names of concepts or their characteristics  . For a new NL , another KB is built up " based on the tran -slation equiwdents provided tbr concepts in the sour-celanguage KB "  ( SkMe 90 )  ;   ( 2 ) Translators ' Work-Bench ( TWB ) : the meanings of each term are descri-bed by CGs . A concept is related to several terms via synonyms and foreign NL equivalents  ( HoAh 92 )  . 
The available xamples present disconnected , though formal definitions of meanings . However , there is (1) systematic conceptual evaluation ;   ( 2 ) no access by a context sensitive user interface ;   ( 3 ) no theoretically sound solution for multiling md systems  . 
2.3. Generation of Explanations
There are similarities between DB-MAT and other NL generation systems  , e . g . IDAS which produces technical documentation l~om a domain KB and linguistic and contextual models  ( RMLe 95 )  . in a sense IDAS builds an online user interface to KBs and provide system mmwers by NL generation  . The system generates hypertext nodes ( both text and links ) with relevant follow up questions . The following particularities however display tile differences between the systems :  ( 1 ) IDAS is a full scale application , its KI , -ONE like KB contains more domain information and the proper system evaluation can be performed  ;   ( 2 ) the hypertext links act as visuMhints for the available relevant information  , while the user should " guess " that in DB-MAT ; (3) the DB-MATKB pretends to be arbitrary , i . e . we investigated the integration of arbitrary domain KB into applications in the humanities  ; as a contrast the IDASKB contains fixed number of  ( rusk-adequate ) " concept md relations " mtd supports fixed query types  ;   ( 4 ) the systems cert ~ dnly have difl creut interface design oriented towards dilf brent go~ds and user types  . 
3. Benefits of the Knowledge Based MAT
The optimal separation of domain knowledge as an independent source facilitates its structuring and processing and makes its theoretic ~ dl ' oundation sound  . 
KBs seem difficult to acquire ( compared to informal textua lexicons )  , but this is not true with respect of ormal and heterogeneous lexicon structures  . Moreover , formal descriptions are built up increasingly both for research and industrial applications  , e . g . 
formal specification siu'e developed by wuious acquisition tools  . Thus DB-MAT aims at the reuse of KBs in a MAT system  . 
Keeping knowledge in a separate structure nables its processing with h  ) nnal operations . Especially li ) nnal consistency and semantic coherency can be best achieve xlina well-defined representation lmlguag c  . In DB-MAT the NL explanation semantics is kept as CGs as long its possible : we tailor the explanation to the users ' expectatious by the formal operations projection midjoin  . By inheritance the adequate degree of detailness in the generated answer is provided  ( AuBo96 )  . 
In multiling uMMAT , the CG type hierarchy proved to be particularly useful in case of e  . g . 
terminological gaps . For missing translation equivalents , the type hierarchy provides NL explanations about the " relative position " of the highlighted term  . The attributes of the node are verbalized in the source language to facilitate paraphrases in the target one  ( WiAn 93 )  . 
4. DB-MAT
DB-MAT is a knowledge-bm ; edTWB providing linguistic as well as domain knowledge support  . The system has a user-fliendly interface , with a main window separated into two scrollable regions lor the so-urce and target exts  . The mmslator selects the explanation language ( Gern ~ ln , Bulgarian ) midOm detail-uess of the generated explanations ( Less , More ) with radio buttons . DB-MAT provides figures as well , to facilitate the user's und cr standiug of the domain  . 
Currently all figures are associated to lexicon entries  . 
4.1. Mainmenu
Except File and Edit with their stmt dard functionality  , them mn menu contains three t~sk-spccificlems : -tinder Note the user selects flags  ( < Checklater > , < Gap > , etc . ) to be inserted in the text as reminders ; -Information provides mouolingual support and access to awfilable figures  .   ( \] rmnmaticld data from the lexicon is shown to the user  . Under the submenu Explanations , a NL explanation is generated for terms while for nonterms a textual definition is given instead  ( the user should always get something without bothering fl-om wh cm the answer comes  )  ; -Multilingual offers bilingual data . Under Tran-slations the lexicon correspondences are presented  . 
The other subitems are Idioms and Examples.
4.2. The Lexicon
I ) B-MAT uses one lexicon , i . e . general vocabulary and terms arc distinguished by checking whether text dcfinitinns or KB-pointers arc avifi labl c  . There is one entry per meaning . Special links contained in and consists of ( Fig . l , " cross ref " of Ids #35 ,  29 ,  40) , acquired scant-automatically , provide precise mapp-ings of tile chosen text segments out  ( ) lexicon items . 
The lexicon contains ( BoEu 95 ) :  ( 1 ) moq ) hological data organized in morpho-groups ( part of speech , inflection class , verb types , etc ) ;   ( 2 ) syntactic information-syntax groups used by the NL generator only and some text striugs  ( e . g . list of collocations ); (3) synonyms ( Ids #29 ,  40) , antonyms , abbreviations ; (4) text definitions for general vocabulary ( e . g . ld#17) ; (5) relbmnces for biling md correspondences . 
4.3. The KB and the Query Mapper ( QM)
The KB consists of concepts , a type hierarchy and conceptual graphs . Each graph is either a semantic definition of a term or contains certain f~tctual knowledge  . The QM , our " what to say " component , extracts as temporary graphs ( by CG projection ) knowledge fragments to be verbalized . There is no fixed prc defined schema mapping a user reques to some knowledge fragments  . Given a highlighted term ( i . e . its KB concept ) , and the user request for domain knowledge , the QM searches the KB on the fly and extracts all relevant facts according to the conceptual relations  . Depending on the detailncss level , all attributes mid char , tcteristics are inherited fl'om a more generic n ( xle . 
For each query type , the QMm , -dntains a list of relevant conceptual relations . So far , the QM has a fixed scope of extraction : for most of the conceptual relati-bscheidung von ~ und Fests to ffenaus IT yp~s of  . . .

onsit is " one step around " the selected concept  . Nes-ted graphs ( e . g . situations ) are extracted as unbreak ab-le knowledge fragments due to their specific meanings  . The explanation semantics i under certain control : the QM does not allow trivial answers like " O il separator is a non-animated physical object " etc  . 
Detail ediscussion is given in ( AnBo96).
4.4. The Generator ( EGEN)
The generation algorithms are strongly influenced by some features of the CGs and their well -defined operations  . An important asset of the CGs proved to be their nonhierarchical structure  , allowing for the generation to start from any KB node without any graph transformations  . Thus EGEN may select the subject and the main predicate of each sentence from a linguistic perspective rather than being influenced by the structuring of the underlying semantics  ( as with the frequently used treelike notations )  . 
EGENs input is : (1) the relevant knowledge pool ; (2) the explanation language ;   ( 3 ) the highlighted concept ( s )   ( the corresponding term ( s ) will become the global focus of the generated explanation  )  ;   ( 4 ) the query type ( necessary for the selection of an appropriate text-organisation schema  )  ;   ( 5 ) all iterative call flag indicating a request for fua her clarification  . 
In order to produce a coherent explanation , EGEN orders the CGs by applying a suitable text organisation schema  ( AnBo96 ) -definition , similarity or difference ( similar to those in McKe 85 )  . Afterwards the generator breaks some CGs into smaller graphs or joins similar ones into a single graph to ensure that each CG is expressible in a single sentence  . Finally EGEN verbalizes the CGs by applying the utterance path approach-the algorithm searches for acyclic path which visits each node and relation at least once  . 
If a node is visited several times then grammar ules determine when and how it is verbalized  . As proposed adjectives and adverbs , while conceptual relations are mapped into " functional words " or syntactic elements  . The Sowa's algorithm is extended ( AnBo96 ) to: ( 1 ) process extended referents ( e . g . measures , conjunctive and disjunctive sets , etc . ); (2) group relevant features together ( e . g . first utter all " dimension " attributes , then all " weight " attributes , etc . instead of mixing them up ) ; (3) introduce relative clauses mtd conjunctions ;   ( 4 ) generate a sentence tree allowing Ibr future transformations  . The APSG grammar used by EGEN is implemented in

Additionally , EGEN keeps all uttered concepts in a stack and later refers to them using a definite article or a pronoun  . This stack is cleared in the end of the explanation  , unless there is an iterative request . 
A request for definition ( " What is ?" ) of " Olphasen " is given on Fig .  1 . Some relevant lexicon entries , are presented . The QM extracts the supertype and the conceptual relations ATTR  , CHAR and RESULT ( AnBo96) . The extracted temporal graphs , are shown in linear notation . They contain , all occurrences of the " highlighted " concept and rite necessary conceptual relations  . The QM has applied the type contraction operation in order to " simplify " the graphs  . Thus there are complex concepts like \[ LIGHTER THANWATER \] which have corresponding type definitions  . 
5. Costs of the knowledge based MAT
It is difficul to acquire the interrelated lexicon /KB although once the KB is acquired  , the reuse effect will decrease tile costs of adding a new NL to the system  . In DB-MAT we used special lexicon acquisition tools and we plan to develop tools with restricted NL interlace for future KB acquisition  . Our estimation is that DB-MAT resources , are not more complicated than the lexicons in sophisticated MT systems  , e . g . the KBMT lexicon and ontology ( GoNi91) . However , tile proper use of AI-methods requires additional study  , design efforts and evalualion expcrhnents oriented towards knowledge bxsed NLP  . 
6. Implementation and Conclusion
The DB-MAT demo is implemented in LPA MAC Prolog 32 . Specia lexicon acquisition tt xlls were developed . The German lexicon contains about 900 entries . The KB ( about 300 concept nodes and 30 conceptual relations ) was manually acquired from a textbook and encyclopedias in admixture separation  . 
The lexicon covers a demo text but any MacProlog readable file demonstrates the DB-MAT features if it contains the basic terminology  ( enabling requests lor domain explanations )  . 
DB-MAT studies one of the possib ! e applications of KB-methods to computational terminology and translation aid tools  . Furthere search is aimed at : ( 1 ) building a larger KB ;   ( 2' ) development of a general methodology relating the terminology to the corres-pouding conceptual knowledge  ; (3) expefime uts with the role of negation ;   ( 4 ) improvement of the generation to ensure more elaborate and coherent output combining textual and graphical information  .
