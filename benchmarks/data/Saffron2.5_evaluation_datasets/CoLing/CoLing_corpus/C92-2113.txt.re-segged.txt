Abstract
One of the characteristics of dialogue translation is that it is strongly dependent on the situation or the communicative goal where the utterance is spoken  . 
Moreover , the distance between the language pair is great , the possibilities of the transfer diverse and it would be difficult to guarantee the equivalence of translation  . 
In this article , we propose a method of utilizing domain and language specific constraints from the view ~ point of transfer phase in a dialogue translation system  . q ~ ansfer processing sometimes requires various kinds of information : e  . g . , domain knowledge for ellipsis resolution , language dependent communicative structures ( focus , theme , rheme ,   . . . ) . 
Our standpoint is that there are certain language specific strategies on producing utterances in communication  . As steps towards clarifying those stratcgies , we first discuss tim issue of typical idiosyncratic gaps between two language pairs  . Next , to resolve such problems we suggest a new framework of incorporating domain and language specific knowledge a  . stransferrides for dialogue translation from the viewpoint of transfer phase  . Finally we will mention related issues and further investigation  . 
1 Introduction
The difficulty of translating spoken dialogues between two language si often greater than that of translating written text  . This is because translation of certain expressions in a source language are affected by previous context or couun unicative goal stinder conll nonknowledge for dialogue particip auts  . If the two languages are quite different from each other  , possible expression candidates increase . This further complicate stile problems of producing utterances in dialogue translation  . 
In the author's recent work\[12\] , t be factors which affect lexical choices aud setting the default translation considering those factors were discussed for selecting appropriate verbs  . Of course the selection of an appropriate verb in given situations is only a small part of the great theme of translation i various levels of expressiou : e  . g . , selection of modality correspond ing to illocutionary forces  , correct choice of articles , etc . The problem , however , includes important aspects of linguistic phenomena related to other levels  . 
In that article , some examples of relationships between Japanese and English verbs were investigated using a dialogue corpus translated by human interpreters  . Through comparing corresponding verbs in Japanese and English  , some tendencies were envisaged concerning the characteristics specific to dialogue translation  . 
Ill another work\[13/ , we discussed the issue of translating dialogue utterances through a partitioned semantic network  , part of which is actually lexicalized . 
A method was proposed for managing the semantic network  , i . e . re-partitioning of the network , which yields a more natural translation of utterances  . We assumed three kinds of partitions : the mevs . theme , old vs . new information , and for e-vs . background . 
The prodncing of target utterances starts with pro -ceasing along the lines suggested by the source language  , and then the given partition can be repart i -tioned according to properties of the target language  . 
Along this examination , we started to describe actual transferules for certain kinds of Japanese utterance that seem to be ditficult to translate directly into Euglish  , because of lacking substantial words in Japanese . This is the background and the motivation of the current study  . 
Our presuppositions are as follows.
? The analysis of input utterances are lim-i ted in the source language  . 
Basically , dctinite/indetinite or plural/singular markers are not indicated in Japanes explicitly  . 
Moreover , various kinds of arbitrary/obligatory ellipses of subjects/objects/predicates  ( occasionally ) are difficult to resolve within sentential in -tormation  . 
? A translbrprocessing is perfomned between lal~guage dependent features truc-tllres  . 
The analysis module outputs a . feature struc-tnre , which indicates the relationships between predicates and their complements and other information including some pragmatic features  .

Those complements are often eliminated if they are already known as old information  . When honorific expressions ( respective , condescend , polite ) are used , a certain kind of the ellipses ( zero-pronouns referring the speaker or the hearer  ) can be resolved by using these key expressions in many cases  . \[ I \] However , there are another sort of utterances which lack substantial words and are difficult to understand individually  . As a target of our examinations , we selected an expression called " dr-expression  "  . Though there are a lot of variations for da-expressions\[14\]  , we consider one of their types that has a structure : Copula  ( A , B ) . It means that A and B is identical ( in a certain sense )  . In many cases , we cannot translate such a dr-expression without knowing the context where the utterance is spoken  . 
Our current arget domain for dialogue translation is " conference regist ration task "  . The example ~ n-tenses referred in this article arc from the doina in  . 
Suppose that the following Japanese utterances should be translated  .

Of course this English sentence is not acceptable in ordinary situations  . Accordingly a certain way of e omplementation is required  . There can be several alternatives and it might be difficult to chooscone appropriate x pression among them  . For instance ,   J2 could be translated in various ways if such a eom -p\]ementation is performed  .

AcrEsDECOLING-92 , NANTES , 2328 AOUi'1992757I)gOC . OFCOLING-92, NANTES , AUG .  2328 , 1992 There are some Japanese expressions ( typically " da-expreasions " ) which lack a substantial word ( s ) known fortile dialogue participants . In the previous example sentence J2 , the substantial words are : sankaryou ( fee ) and ginkou-furikomi ( bank-transfer )  . 
The word sankary ou is the Theme 2 of this utterance and it is already known ( old information ) in the previous utterance . And the word " shiharau " does not appear in J2 , while it appeared in J1 .   . 12 is a typical da-expression ( a kind of copula sentence ) in

The Rheme 2 of the sentence J2 is obviously ginkou-furl koml ( bank-transfer ) and it meets the focus of the previous question J1  . Accordingly the utterance J2 satisfies the Grice's maxim of informativity . In English , however , we can't say " The feeishank-transfer . "W chave to elaborate the utterance with some substantial or functional words  . 
Generally such kinds of knowledge for elaboration have been provided with domain knowledge which are commonly accessed by respective processing modules  . 
We propose that the concept of Mel'~uk's lcxie al functions can be extended for designing special sets of domain-dependent lexieal functions  . This idea is as follows . 
2  . 2 How to e laborate an e l l ip t i ca l sentence ?   1  , brintroducing our methodology , we use the following predicate-complements no ation  ( hereafter PS )  . 
\[\[ Pred Predicate-symbol \]\ [ Case-label l Complement i \]\[ C as  e-label2   Complement2\]  \[  Case-label3   Complement3\]  ?  .   . \] The Japanese utterance J2 ( I:S-J2 ) can he illustrated as follows . 
\[\[ PredCOPULA\]tub\]e SANKARYOU\]\[Iden GINKOU_FURIKOMI \]\] 
PS-J2. corresponding to J2
If we transfer it into English , we have to modify tile structure using definite semantic relationships  . 
\[\[ProdPAY\]\[Agen\[\]\]\[ObjeFEE\]\[ MamtBANK_TRANSFER\]\]

Theme : Topic , what is communicated about Pdleme ; Connnenl , what is communic . ~ted3Tllereare ~ . lot of vaa'iations of cla expre ~ qiolm observed in our dialogue corpus  . 
The structure PS-E2 could yield two sentences : The fee is paid by bank-transfer  . 
You pay the feeby bank-transfer.
lIowever , it is still unnatural because the speaker's intention doesn't appear in these sentences  . Therefore another elaboration is needed for producing a more sophisticated utterance  . 
The previous utterance J 1 is apparently a question that demands a value referred with the interrogative " dono youni "  ( how )  . During our pre-transfer phase , an Illocutionary Force Type ( IFT ) of tile given sentence is extracted . t7\] In this case , the IFT of J1 is determined ~ us QUESTION REF . 
So far the assignment of IFTs was decided with matching surface expressions  . Accordingly tile IFT of J2 is first recognized ms INFOI1  . M(default IFT ) , be canse the predicate DA-identlcal ( colmla ) does not specify any explicit intention .

Then , we need supplementary information on PS-E2.
For example :\[\[ IFTREQUEST\]\[Agen* SPEAKER*\]\[Recp*HEARER*\]\[Obje\[\[ PredPAY\]\[Agen\[\]\]tub\]eFEE\]\[ MannBANK_TRANSFER\]\]

I\[owcver , w c have to beea refll that even in such a presupposition some general knowledge  ( rect a knowledge ) is indispensable to make elaboration tbr elliptical sentences  . 
3.1 Domain knowledge
Within our task domain , we have some kinds of enlpirical knowledge of " registration for a confercnee "  . Wc observe several frequent verbs with specifically Ciominanteo occurrenee of nouns  . Thougb these nouns do not always appear explicitly  , we carl assume their existence in the background of utterances  . 
l ' brexample , we can describe preferable candidates of complements which have strong relationships with a verb " pay " in our target domain  ,   5 The italic letter symbols indicate e one eptnal categories  . 
pay object-(attendance ) fee , amoun ~ of money pay agent dialogue pavticipanl ( speaker/imarer ) pay manner -- bank-transfer , credit card , in cash pay-time-destination-date , deadline Here we define a set of domain dependent knowledge aftertimnotation of lexical fimctions proposed by  Mel'~uk\[8\]  . 
Obje(pay ) : : ?. fee
Agen(pay ) - ~ participant
Mann(pay ) => bank-transfer
T des(pay ) -> dale
Note that the above descril ) tions have a direction . 
The right hand symbols can be conceptual categories . 
Then the relationship between fee and bank -transfer can be obtained throlgh an indirect path  . Such kiuds of knowledge can be extracted semiautomatically from our dialogue corpus  , to ' u certain extent .

hi Japane , ~ dialogues , tile speaker's intention tends to appear intire sentence final expression semditis quite often rendered indirectly  . 
a2: sankary ouw a ginkou-furiko midesu*.
This is a neutrald a-expression and there is no additional information other than indication of the method of payment  . I lowew ~ r , the following exam-pies includes some special nuances in their final expressions  . Both of them are quite natural as responses to the qnestion J  1  . 
J 2a : sankary ouw a ginkou-furikomitona Zte orira as u  , ( polited a-expression )
J 2b : sankary ouw a ginkou-fur ? kom ? de one gaish imasu  .   ( polite request ) We think that these Japanese utterances are equivalent under the given situation  ( or tile communicative goal )  . In any cases , the method of payment is designated . The point is how it should bc communicated . 
We can assume the attitnde of the speaker is kept consistent in principle  . The translation shonld also follow this rule , especially in ca . ue of the utterances by the secretary of the conference  . It couhl affect the style of expressions . Infa et , we found many 1N-FORM utternces really mean indirect REQUEST . 
The indirectnessi remarkable in Japanese ( using da-expressious ) and a direet translation can be abrut ) tor not informative , partly because there seems to be no polite copula expressions in Ellglish  . Therefore , a certain transfer of IFT might be required . 
We have to consider some constraints for al ) plying such a rule . In this case , the IF q ' of the previous utterance ( Q\[II , ' , STIONRI'~F ) should be known . Additionally the focus of the question is needed . Furthermore , thesaurus knowledge about predicates and complements might I  ) e referred .

When the ACs unify with the RE in a certain phase  , the appheation of the rule fires . Thus , the transfer process is procedurally performed , according to the REs . This allows individual rules to be rather declarative and include few procedural decisions for lexical choice  . 
We implemented the rules that contain domain and language specific constraints  , extending this RWS .

Rule 3. Transfer rule for IFT
TA concise description for notation of rewriting ( tra~mfer ) rules : The first line of a rule indicates the target feature path of rewriting  , followed by Application Constraints with combinations of pm'a~neters and their values  ; e . g . : Type : Generah The patterns in = . . . and out = . . . indicate the input and the output ( sub ) feature stntcturer ~ pectively . Some additional conditions can be described using if sentences  . For referring a feature value , a feature path i ~ a to t ~ to-down direction can be used like as Input  . Obje . Pred Note that the abovemfle ~ are partly modified for explanation using PSs instead of FSs  . 
The explanation for the rules is described as follows  , though the allowed space precludes the detail . 
The whole transfer process are composed of several sub-procedures according to the Rewriting Environ -meats designated by the main rule  ( the top level rule )  . 
The general framework is as follows.
First , the rewriting of ellipsis resolution process provides the missing zero-pronouns referring the speaker or the hearer  . Then an Illocutionary Force Type is given tottle top level of tile feature structure  . After this a kind of normalization is performed ( socalled Japanese-to-Japanese transfer ) in order to make the ( Japanese-to-English ) transfer easier . The processing of these sub-procedures are regarded as a pre-transfer phase  . 
The main transfer phase contains 3 sub-procedures : idiomatic , general and default . The Rule1 is an example of simple general transferules . 
After the main transfer phase , the transfer within the English feature structures is performed  . The Rule 2 and the Rule 3 are applied in this phase . 
Using ttle Rule2 , a Copula predicate structure is transferred to another substantial predicate structure  . When this rule is applied , a local parameter is set to the Rewriting Environment  . After this , under the new RE the transfer of cases ( e . g . lden-~Mann ) is carried out with a not here writing rule including domain knowledge  . 
The Rule3 designates are writing of IFT from IN-FORM to REQUEST under certain conditions  . As mentioned in tile previous section , such a transfer yields a more natural utterance . 
At present heflexibility of the system is still insufficient from the viewpoint of context  , processing . 
I iowever , it is possible to controlapllying rules by means of local parameter setting  ( like : status : complement )  , to a certain extent . 
3  . 4 Other Examples and the cur rent s ta tus The following examples were described as domain and language specific knowledge for translating typical " da-expressions " that appear in our target dc ~ maim The frequency of " da -expressions " iu ATR Dialogue Database is as follows  . This investigation ( by Tomokiyo ) recognized about 200 different word sequences as da-expressions in predicate parts of sentences in the conference registration dialogues  . 
The occurrence of da-expressions : 1 , 845 The occurrence of all predicates : 5 , 200  ( approximately ) The numbers of sentences and words appeared the corpus are respectively  1  , 666 and 38 , 258 . The rate of da-expressions is roughly 35% . Thoughtile exact percentage of copulada -expressions is not yet calculated  , it is estimated at 150~200 . Besides , we envisage some copula expressions which are * to t included in the above investigation  , like " to natte or imasu " ( mentioned in the subsection 3 . 2) . The current ask ACqESDE COLING-92 , NANTES , 2328 AOUq "1992760 PROC . OFCOLING-92, NANTES , AUG .  2328 ,   1992 is to classify the types of copula expressions which require certain complementation f substantial words  . 
Among them , two typical examples are shown as follows . 
aa : Tsugino i in kai waikka getsu godes K.
E 3: The next committee will be held after one month . 
J4: XXX-ho to ruwa ZZZZ-yent on atte or imasu.
E4: As for XXX-hotel , it ( the room charge ) costs ZZZ Zyen . 
Both oftire above Japanese sentences lack substantial predicates : e  . g . corresponding to " will be held " or " costs " . For translation of 33 , an associative knowl-edge ( a kind of common sense ) is required : committee time location ~ be held In this example  , J 3 is the answer for the question that demands the date of the next committee  . Whether or not a substantial predicate indicating the event lead by tire committee and the date  ( interrogation ) appears in the previous utterances , that kind of associative knowledge ( relatively specific to the target domain ) is applica blE . 
As fbr , 14 , an implicit comparison ( actually the local topic of the dialogue is " the expense of hotel rooms "  ) is underlying . In this case , the key to com-plemental , on can bE obtained from tile preceding utterances . It implies that the XXX hoter u with topic nmr ker " wa "  ( it seems to be the subject of the sentence like aa  ) only designates the field of the copula equation  . In our current h'amework of analysis of sentence by sentence  , it is impossible to distinguish the difference between  J3 and a4  . There h ) recertain domain klmw ledge is required . For achieving a suitable translation , it should be comlected with the lawguage specitic constraint of producing  ( discourse ) utterances . The input PS-J4 ( corresponds to the analysis result , of , 14) couhl be rewritten into I'S-E4 , am shown below .

4 Discussion 4.1 Related Issues
Ellipsisivone of the prominent characteristics of Japanese spoken dialogue  . Concerning the issue of identifying Japanese zero pronouns  , we have some previous works . A theoretical foundation was given by Yosbimoto\[15\] and an implementation was performed by Dohsaka\[1\]  , in which zero pronouns referring dialogue participants  ( speaker/hearer ) are identified based on tile usage of honor'tics and the speaker's territory within a sentence  . As such ellipses occn rahnost obligatorily in dialogue  , tim formalization seems to be relatively simple . Of course , the resolution of some phenomena requires more complex information from the context  . 
K udo\[5\] showed that another kind of ellipsis indicating objects in the previous sentence could be r ~ solved with local cohesive knowledg extracted from actual corpora  . This knowledge consists of pmrtern--plate patterns of successive twose  . ntences and enables certain e omplementation f elliptical objects  . The value of ir is work is to bave proposed a method of senti-automatic acquisition of such knowledge from real dialogue corpora  . r 6\] The primary objectiw ~ of these approaches was to resolve ellipses  . Therefore , problems of translation tmve not been sutticiently focused  . Hereaft Er we have to pay attention to the insight suggested in the previous sections  .

The first is a core syntactic structur c that is generally recognized as a universal system of syntax  . T be second syntactic structure is rather language dependent and peripheral  . I lowever , this does not mean that tile second syntactic system is unimlrortant  . Though it is difficult to translate into other languages  , the second syntactic system just reflects the characteristics of a certain langnage  . It includes many favorite expressions ill the language  . This issue is quite interesting also frolntile standpoint of soeioliuguistics and cross language omlnunieation  . 
From tile viewpoint of translating dialogues , if a nexl ) ressi ( m of a source language is peril ) heral and there is no corresponding structures in a target language  , the sources true toure could be transforlned into a universal structure before translation  . In order to perforln this idea , such a transformation should be possible to be formalized  .  1 , ' urtherlnore , certain implicit ( domain - and language-specific ) knowledge might be needed ills on iccases . 
Tile target expression in this article , a certain kind of " da-expressions ' , is regarded as a typical second syntactic structure described above  . Our fnture efforts will be directed to investigating various structures and for refining and extending the methodology proposed here  . 
5 Conclusion
In order to lirovide a effective method of translating a kind of copnla sentences lacking some substantial words  , alnet Alod of utilizing domain and language specific constraints are proposed  . In this attempt , it has been exanfined that both domain knowledge and language speeitic strategies of producing utterances shouhl be incorporated  . The feasibility was shown through typical examples and transferules  , while we need still more in w~stigation i to those linguistic phenomen and have to developtile method of knowledge extraction  .
