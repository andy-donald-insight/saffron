2.2 QLF Semantics
Timscmamics of I11?' , QI , I , 's is presented ill\[ AC92\] arc extended illtilt * , In illlllOf described . As showllahoy (3 , a5: ; IQLF may contain any numt ) er of recta-variables and sotile scm , ' mtics of the language is slighlly different from the tradition alone  . Instead of a function from models to truth values  , a partial function is delined . 
The denotation of a formula F is a partial function\[\[F\]\] from models to truth values  . This partial fimction is defined by W , a relation between a formula , a model axtd ; t truth value . Tile quality of a monotonic semantics i apparent in the case wh cn\[\[F\]\] with rcspcc to seine model is undefined  , i . e . W ( F , m , 1) and W ( F , m , 0) . This situation occurs when recta-variables are present in the QLF and consequentially a partial interpretation is being con-sidcrcd  . The incremcat ~ danalysis provides an ' extension ' of\[\[F\]\]in\[\[F'\]\] whenever F'isa more resolved version of 

The semantic rules that dise ha , gerect a-variables arc of the general fonn : W(F , m , v ) if W(U , m , v ) where F ' is an ' extension ' of F . 
2.3 The Relation CAT
A relation CAT efcategory is de ! in cdwiLh the following arguments  . 
~ , category ? index <" , ' of trent , quanli Jicr > i rater m , o\[prope ' rlyifa ~ or ra ? restriclion , , context Rules describing the discharge of quantifier and reJerent metavariables for teems are defined as follows  . 
1. W(t . ', m , v ) if W ( F\[_q/Q\],m , v)
The term teim ( Y , C , R , _q , _g ) is conlained iI 1 the formula F ? . \] Q:CAT(C ,  :\[ , R , <_r , O > , ctxt)W(F , m , v ) if W ( F\[_r/llEF\] . . . . . v ) and wo ~( m ~;') , - , , t ) The term tea:m(1 , C , R , _q , _:c ) is contained in the forlnuht g3t ~ I41 V:CAT ( c , y , l  ~ , < REF , _q > , ccxt :) for some context ctxt . 
What 1 says is that the troth value efF ( v ) is lhctruth value of F with , for a particular lerl n , all instances of the quantilier_qrcl ) laeed by Q .   2 stales/hat the truth value ef V is dmtruthvahm efF wilh  , for a particular \ [ erm , all instances of tile referent_:creplaced by some referent  1~h3~'  ; and that R , the reslrictionef thaterm , when applied to the rcferent term holds . 
A further set of semantic rules arc defined to deal with 
QLF Iorms and quautificalion.
The complete ruleset as defined in \[ AC92\] defines membership efther clation W . it should be noted that the definition found there is nnderspeeilied in Ihesemantics for category mt  ( l the relation CAT is : t it expansion of the 2 . 
relation S(called's alient') . \[ AC921 mentions that .   .   . the computational nalogue or s was implemented as a collection of ' resolution rules ' in \ [  AIs90\]  . ' ltm work reported in this paper and in \[ IIur93\] is a computational nalogue efC . A'T wilh a more general and declarative treaunent . 
2.4 Defining CAT
Given that certain arguments of tile CAT relation are members of infinite sets  ( context , restriction ) and that others are dependent on these , arguments ( referent ) , all elements of CA 7c , ' mnever be explicitly enumerated . Tile description of this relation should , then , take the arguments that are finite ( category quantifier ) and use some compact definition to accommodate the inliuite arguments  . 
A definition of C . AT bltsed on theorem provingful fills this role , as described in the following sections . The declar-alive delinilion allows the direction of resolution to be indicated bethereels -variables that require ' in sk'mtiatiou  . 
3 LOGICO FRESOLUTION
Before continuing with a more formal definition , ' mex ,  . un-pie of resolntion is presented . The phrase The girl runs has the following abstract form  . 
Resolving this means in sUmtiating the metavariables_q and_r  , and a possible resolution might be to exists and a  1  . ice respectively . 
We can see how the category limits the selection of the quantilier and the selection of the referent with respect othe restriction  , that is-wer ( xluim a single definite object in context for which the restriction holds  . This suggests adclinitiou of CAT as a series of rules defining how the uninslautiated arguments acformed and how values Call be found with respect to the context  , for example CAT(C , I , R , < Ent , exists > , Ctxt ) single ~ obj cct_matching_rcstriction(Ent , R , Ctxt ) Conscquently , infizrence can be used to , in this exmnple , find some value of Entwl fich holds for R in Ctxt . 
3.1 Contextual Entailment of Resolution
The preeess of resolution in the QLF formalism is simply the inslantialion of rectavariables with respect to the rela?tion CAT  . As described previously , this relation involves the context of processing , ' rod~m be expressed logically in the follewing mammt  ; Ctxl ; U/~ssumption ~:\[ ResF ?> F'\]where , for forwmd resolution (-->) , F ' is a mere in smn-tinted vcrsienefF , mid for backwm'd resolution ( ?= ) F is a uun resolved QLF of tile p ~ tially instantia t c d F '  . 
The addition of a set of Assumptions iS included lot " complclcness  , though in tlf is work is in fact , an empty a possible rcferent o be most salient when there are two equally likely possibilitics  . 
In bricf , resolution of Ihc term The girl to some Iokenal ice in file example wotd d have I hec  , ltailme , ,t
Ctxt(C ) run(term(idxl , < .   .   . >, AX . vi,'I(x ),_ T ,_z'))+> run(term(idxi,< .   .   . >, AX . flirl(x ) , exists , ~ li~e )) assuming a lice is s~dient . 
The conditions on a QLF lhat lead to equivalence between are solved and unresolved l brmula can be encoded as a series of declarativ c statemenls  . Theses atem cnl slake category index , < referent , quantifiec >/ property , estric-l\[OtlaIId implement the inleraclion of context wilh respect to I hese by a number of logical primitives  . That is to say , I heal ) slract notation us c ( lh ) dcliuc CA7 is rcalised as a rule with either of the billowing structures : term  (  .   .   . ) if G ' ; : form ( . . . ) if G where C is a set of logical primitives , principally proof goals , detining CAT- , and\[hetermand:form containtile arguments to the relation  , context being globally delined . 
3.2 Inference for Resolution
If we cml transform a QI , I , " into a lirst order logical representation then we can exploit existing Iccl miqucs to verify a resolution in conlext  . 
\[J Sillgi , dhrel ~ ce allows rc soluli ( m to be completely declarative and , I hemfore , applicable in both directions . 
All that is required to ensure reversibility is that we allow Ih cinlcrence mechanism to instantiate not only arguments  , but the predicates h ) und in restrictions . 
A description of the dcclaraliv crules will bc presented next before continuing wilh tile description of Ihc proof procedure  . 
3 . 3 Dec lara t ive Ru les De l in ing C?4T One case of resolution is presented showing how I hercs-Olulion rules employ conditions Io define the category semantics R  ) rsingulard clinite terms . 
Singular l ) e finite Terms
Andedelining Ihesemantics of this catcgory must provide a quanlilier and a referent that hokls for the relation  ( ' . .47- . 
The exisl cnlial quanlifier is a Pl ~ ropriale in I he subset of QLF considered in I his work  . The referent should be some salient entity such that tile category of lhcco  , eferent agrees with the category of the term being resolved  ( i . e . 
number agreement etc . ) attd Ilia \[ the reslriclion of the lenn being resolved hohls for lhat entity  . 
So we wish to state two conditions I hat must hold ia order for lhere solution  1o bca correct de da ratiou el ' gilT for a singular deliuite term  . 
The rule , then , is stated , as to ~ m(Iax , \ [ aot = the , n , ,m = sing \]; Rst ~- , ~ ists , on t(Znt )) salient_entity(Ent , Idx , \[ dot ~- . the , nun=sing\]) satisfy_qlf(term(Idx , \[ det-----the , hum=sing\] , 
R str , exists , ent ( Znt )   )   )   4 THEOREM PROVING This section det ~ fils filetiered theorem proverlhatistim core of tile resolution mech  , ' mism . The axioms associated wilh each layer , are , also mentioned . 
An intuitivemployment of this technique applied to terms as a method of resolution might include the following compotleffls  , given t in t w e , ' u'e dealing with a QLF and some conjunctive normal form datable  . 
1. Couvert QLF to logic adform.
2 . Satisfytile logical form w if l lathe or empr over . 
I lowever , wifl ll tile use of suitable , axioms we ~' m collapse these into one step . In order to do this , the QLF formalism must be accepted as valid fonnulae ill thel  , ' m-guage of the Iheorem prover . The advant , q geoft iffs method allows a single style of operation to be employed in the satisfaction of QLFs  . 
In order for this method of resolution to work correctly bidirectionally  , it is required that we allow the Iheorem prover to rm~ge over arguments and predicates in tile database  . This : dlows file algorithm to function ill the reverse direction  . This being file case , logical terms ( al'ler processing ) , are asserted in the database in a list format , i . e . \[ predicate , arg , , arg2 .   .   .   . \] in-stead of Dredicate ( arg , .   .   .   .  ) . Also , QLF ' templates ' ( see\[Ihu93\] for a full expl~mation ) are used to provide a desirable set of generatable noun phrase structures in the backw ~  , r direction . 
4.1 " l~vo Layers
There arc two layers ill the theorem prover . The reason for this is as follows . Ultimately , we want to co , mernourselves with proofs like p(token ) . In order to do this w chave to transform I hc origim dQLF into a series of  , ' tssoci-ated predicates . The argunm nt so these predicates may be QI , Fs themselves which required is charge of a quantified term to produce a logical cxprcs siou  . The process of discharge cannot be accomplished with a simple declarative rule local to the prc dieate as a number of representations exist in the CI  , 1 / QLF formalism that require discharged to a token in a procedur  , - dm , ' mner . Therefore , it is necessary to lirst perform an mnber of transformations  , together with a procedural implementation fterm discharge  ,   , as a lirst stage to using tile the or cn~pr over in resolution  . 
,553 4 . 2 Top Proof qhe first layer of the theorem prover is concerned with QLFs and the QLF axioms  . The axiom sm~e used to effectively translbnn the QLF into a lirst order notation from which point simple in lettuce can be carried out with respect othelacls asserted in the dat ~ fl ~ ase  . This level of proof is straightl brw mdm~d involves three cases  . Modesponens , and intro and the special case , discharge of terms . 
Case 1 is the use of a QLF axiom . The second case is simply the proof of a conj uuct by the proof of its parts  . * i ' heliuif l case is the discharge of terms . The discharge of terms reduces a term exprcssio a into a token about which inference cm~betanled out with the assertions in the dolna in  . An algorithm exists to carry out this procedural attachment to tile proof  \[1   hu93\]  . 
4.3 QLFAxioms
An important coln pollellt of his level of the proof mechanism is the set of axioms used to l 'Cl  ) rcs cn thercht tionship between the restriction and the logical latlgua ?  , e of I hc dalabase . 
The following is an example of an axiom used by the top level of the theorem prover and is rule that encodes the reduction of the restriction of a possessive fom ~  . 
~o~(_ , po ~ , n , do ~ , :\[~ d , \[ pl , A \] , Iv , A , " l \] , ~ pv(X'v\[po ~ , x , Y \] , In a ox ))\ [ po ~ . ~ , A , ~\] a\[pl , A \] which represent she following fl reduction . 
l , A : : ( P~(A)AF(A , g)\[aX ~ r(po~4X , r ))\]: . ( P~(A)A~x~y(po~4X , ~')) ( A,n )) 3 . ( PI(A ) A poss(A , B )) which has the same logical form . 
4.4 General Theorein Prover
The second layer of the proof procedure takes as inptt\[a  ( possibly pm tially instanliated ) logical expression and an entity and returns , conditionally on success , the fully instantiat cd logical expression . 
There are three different cases which the proof mecha-  , nist n deals with . These are as follows .   . , 1 . A clause is present in the conlcxt model which unifies with the expression to be shown  . 
2 . An inferencer tfle can be employed to prove the expression  , in which case each of the autcccd cnt proofs must be constructed  . 
3 . A proof of equality caa be constructed , in which case sul ) slitution is made between the entities in the equality proof and this equal cntily is used in I h c p r o o f  . 
4.5 Domain Axioms
The second layer of tim theorem prover ' also has a set of x doms with which to generak  ; proofs . These axioms are either iLs sert cd in the data b , ' tseaspint offl ~ e interaction between the user and the system  , or may be explicitly placed the reprior to use ? 5 PARAPHRASING The object of paraphrasing is to produce a concise m ~ d  , if possible , m ~ ml biguous description of a previou state . ~ mcnt . As this work is only concernex l with generation of objcct descriptions  , we wm~t to use the technique described for reversible resolution midproduce a string that describes the entity according to a set of evaluation criteria  . This set of criteria can then be evaluated in file context of a preference metric used to selec the best description loGe aeration is carried out by the CLE  . ~ I\]lemeth- . 
ods employed to generate from a QLF are discussed in\[  SvNPMg0\]  . 
5  . 1 Const ra in ts on Descr ip t ion There are a nt unber of consmfint that should be consider exl when producing a noml phrase to describe an object  . A suitable subset is : 1 . Effort of Realisafion ( ER ): amc , ' mure of the effort required to realise the actual words in the medium used  . 
2 . Effort of Association ( EA ) : amc ~ sure of the effort required to associate some entity with lira description realised  . 
3 . Informational Value ( G ): ame , ~sure of the complexity of the realisation . 
4 . Domain Coverage ( DG ) : a measure of the number of items in the domain that ~ m be described by the realisalion  . 
5 . t : A T ccts of Salience : how such things , as recency effect the other dimensions . 
5.2 Preference by Dimension
The following is a simple interpretation ftile at ) evecon-strainls as a lira attempt at obtaining a metric for noml phrase preferences  . 
l~m h dimension is preferred ~1 . Minimise , 2 . Min-imise , 3 . Maximise ( with respect to salience ), 4 . Miu-imise ( unique lement of domain preferred); , and a simple implementation f the dimensions might be  ( functions of )  1 . ER : the physical lengfll of the orthographic representation  . 
2 . EA : the size of the proof ( or a weighted sum of the proof )  . 
al ) esigning a metric for any stage of Natural Languagelh ' ocessing will always have a certain adhoc nature  . I Iowever , intuitive principals can often gukle through the vagaries  .
