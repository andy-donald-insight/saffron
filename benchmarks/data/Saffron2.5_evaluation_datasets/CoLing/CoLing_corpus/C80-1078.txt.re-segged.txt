A new method for automatic keyword
extracting and " role " setting is proposed based on the Japanese sentence structure analysis  . 
The analysis takes into account the following features of Japanese sentences  , i . e . , the structure of a sentence is determined by the noun-predicate verb dependency  , and the case indicating words ( kaku-joshi ) play an important role in deep case structure . By utilizing the meaning of a noun as it depends on each predicate verb  , restricted semantic processing becomes possible . An automatic indexing system , equipped with a man-machine interactive error -correcting function  , has been developed . 
The evaluation of the system is performed by applying it in news information retrieval  . 
The results of this evaluation show that the system can be put to practical use  . 
I . Introduction
The main problems arising with the development of an information retrieval system for the Japanese text are the need for  , saving man power , standardizing information storage , and the realization of efficient retrieval . 
In the case of the English text , the stop word removing method for automatic keyword extraction has been put to practical use  . 
However , in the case of the Japanese text which consists of Kan Ji and Kana characters  , a keyword extraction method utilizing statistical word frequency data has been reported by a Kyoto University group  . 3 This paper proposes a new method of automatic keyword extraction and " role " setting for Japanese news information retrieval  . The " role " characterizes semantic identification of each keyword in a sentence and is classified into six categories  , i . e . , human subject , human object , time , place , action , and miscellaneous important information . 
The main features of Japanese sentences can be characterized as follows:  ( I ) The structure of a sentence is determined by the noun-predicate verb dependency  . 
(2 ) The case indicating words ( kaku-joshi ) play an important role in deep case structure . 
Taking these features into account , D . G . Hays's dependency grammar I and C . J . Fillmore's case grammar 2 arc utilized in the sentence structure analysis . The sentence pattern table containing a noun -predicate verb dependency relationship plays an important function in the analysis  . By utilizing the meaning of a noun as it depends on each predicate verb  , restricted semantic processing becomes possible . An automatic indexing system 5 , equipped with a man-machine interactive error -correcting function  , has been developed based on the method described . Evaluation of the system has been done by applying it in news information retrieval  . 
2. Role Settin ~ Criteria
The employed criteria for the role setting of each keyword in a news sentence are as follows :  ( I ) " Action " ( A for short ) is assigned to verbs which express movement and are elements of the " predicate " set  . 
(2 ) " Time " ( T for short ) can be assigned without ambiguity . 
(3) " Human subject " ( ES for short) , " human object " ( EO for short) , " place " ( P for short ) and " miscellaneous important information " ( Y  ~ I for short ) arc assigned to noun words according to the following criteria :  ( a ) Words which express humans or organizations have either role " HS " or " riO "  . The distinction can be made by examining the subsequent kaku-joshi  . 
( b ) Words which express things without consciousness have role " If !"  . 
( c ) A country name has role " HS " if it is presumed to have consciousness as an organization  . It has role " P " if it means territory . 
( d ) An airplane or as hip have role " IIS " when they are personified together with the driver  , role " P " when they express the place , and role " MI " when they mean things . 
( e ) Ambiguities in item ( c ) and ( d ) are removed by knowing which predicate verb the word depends on and this determine which human  , organization , place or miscellaneous matter it expresses . 

To clarify the description , some exa ~ uples are given below : ex . 1) " State A " ga " State B " wosh ih ai . suru . 
HSHOA(control ) < State A controls State B . >
In this sentence " ga " and " wo " are kaku-josh is . 
ex . 2) ' ~ tate A " ga " H-Sea " wosh ihai-suru.
HSPA < State A controls M-Sea . > ex . 3) " State A " ga " petroleum'h ~ o
HSMIshihai-suru.
A < State A control spetroleum . > ex . 4) " . ~ solation ism " ga " State A " wo
MIIl Oshihai-suru.
A < Islationism controls State A . >  ( 4 ) As mentioned above the " role " of a noun word is determined by considering the following three elements : i  . e . ,  ( a ) the predicate verb whieh the noun word depends on  ( b ) the meaning of the noun word ( c ) the kaku-joshi which is concatenated to the noun word  3  . Japanese Sentence Structure Analysis The basic Japanese sentence pattern is expressed as "  NFINF2--NFnPV  "  , where NF i , which is called " meishi-bunsetsu " , is composed of a noun word and case indicating words  , and where PV is a predicate verb . 
The Japanese sentence structure is characterized by the following points  , i . e . ,  ( I ) The predicate verb is put at the end of the sentence ?  ( 2 ) The position of a " meishi-bunsetsu " in a sentence is not fixed  . 
(3 ) A " meishi-bunsetsu " could be omitted in a discourse which consists of several sentences  . 
Utilizing D . G . Hays's dependency grammar , noun-predicate verb dependency relationships are formulated  . In this formulation the relationships between nouns are irrelevant  . 
Therefore , the Japanese sentence structure becomes independent of noun-word order  , and a word omission is expressed in terms of the presence of a dependency relationship in the sentence  . Since " role " is semantic identification of a word  , by applying C . J . Fillmore's case grammar 2 , it can be assigned to each keyword by clarifying the case structure of the predicate verb  . (Figure I ) In Japanese sentence structure analysis , the predicate verb is identified first and then dependent noun words are determined in order of nearness to the predicate verb  . The sentence is parsed by using topdown analysis . The bottom-up method is not adopted because it causes much ~ nbiguity in the parsing of words which do not directly depend on the predicate verb  . The need for classification of noun words in terms of their meaning is mentioned in chapter  2  . Noun words are classified into seven semantic classes in order to analyze noun-predicate verb dependency relationships efficiently and to set " role " s to them  , i . e . ,  ( i ) Organization ( ii ) Person ( iii ) Literature ( iv ) Place ( v ) Action ( vi ) Name of matter , Abstract idea , etc . 
( vii ) Time
Predicate verbs are classified by taking into account the meaning of the dominated words and their cases  .   ( Figure 2 ) The sentence pattern table is constructed based on this predicate verb classification  . ( Figure 3) In the news retrieval system , about 5600 predicate verbs are classified into 586 classes ; this classification is called case-information ( A4-code )  . The sentence pattern table contains 1686 patterns . A Sentence pattern in the table is composed of four triplets at most  . Elements of the triplet are the semantic class identification code of the noun word  , kaku-joshi , and the " role " which is determined in terms of the values of the first two elements  . 
For example " shihai-suru " ( control ) and " kogeki-suru " ( at taek ) belong to No . 46 category . 
The predicate verb of this category has six sentence patterns and each sentence pattern has two triplets  . The first sentence pattern has triplets ( ga , A , 1) and ( wo , I , 2) . The first code of the triplet is " kaku-joshi " , the second I ) Freedom in the position of " meishi-bunsetsu " Japanese Surfase  2  ) O missibility of " meishi-bunsetsu " in a discourse Sentence Characteristics  3  ) " Meishi-bunsetsu " is composed of a noun-word and case indicating words ?

Sentence analysis and " role " setting are performed referring to this sentence pattern table  .

The man-machine interactive error-correction unit consists of a Kanjivideo terminal and a Kanji line printer  . 
5. Evaluation of the System
The system has been evaluated by applying it to news information retrieval  . The results of this application show , that , based on the assumption that the content word dictionary and the sentence pattern table cover  90% of the processed words and processed sentence patterns  ,   85 to 90% of the keywords and 80 to 85% of the set roles extracted are estimated to be correct  . Also , the time required for indexing is only one third of that required for conventional manual inde ~ ng  , and the retrieval precision-ratio is improved by 20 to 30% without affecting the recall-ratio ~ With this method the turn-arround time for information storage is reduced to half of that of the conventional manual method  . Examples of output are given in Figure 7 .
