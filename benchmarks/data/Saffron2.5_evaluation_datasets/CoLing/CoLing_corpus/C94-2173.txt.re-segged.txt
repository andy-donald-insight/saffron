1 INTRODUCTION
In information extraction systems , finite-state pattern matchers are becoming popular as a means of identifying individu~d pieces of information in a sentence  . Pattern matching systems for English texts are reported to be suits  , hiet or achieving a high level of per\[br-mance with less effort  , compared to full parsing architectures \[ Hobbs et al  92\]  . Amongs eventeen systems presented in the Fifth Message Understanding Conference  ( MUC-5 )  , three systems used a pattern marcher a . s the main component for identifying patterns to be extracted \[  MUC-5   93\]  . A pattern matching architecture is appropriate for information extraction fi-omtexts in narrow domains since identifying in format km does not necessarily require full understa  . nding of the text . The pattern matcher can extract information of inter-t Visiting rese  ; trcherfon/NTT Data Communications Systems Corp  . , email : tkitani ~ . rd . nttdM . a . jpHNTT Data Communiclttions Systems Corp . 
est by locating speciIic expressions defined a . skeywords and phrasal patterns obtained by coq ) us analysis . 
This paper describes a pattern matching method that first identifies concepts in a seu-tence and then links critical pieces of information that map to a p~ttern  . The first step in pattern ln~t ching is a concept searvh applied in the TI'  ; XTRACT system of the TIPSTER Japanese microelectronics and corporate  . joint ventures domain saa cobs 93 a\] , \[ aacobs93b\] . 
In this step , keywords representing a concept are searched for within a sentence  . The second step is a . template patterns ea ~ r h applied in the
TEXTRACT joint venture system . A complex pattern to be searched for usually consists of a few words and phrases  , inste ~ d of just one word , as in the concept search . The template pattern search recognizes relationships between matched objects in the defined pattern a  . swell a . s recognizing the . concept itself . 
l , ' rom the viewpoints of system perf of mance and portal fility across domains  , the TIPS'I . 'I~ ; I I/MUC-5 evaluatiol lJ ' esults suggest that pattern nta . t ching described in this paper is all appropriate architecture for information extraction from  , lapanese texts . 
2 TIPSTER/MUC-5OVER VIEW
The goal of the TI1 ) S TER/MUC-5 project sponsored by ARPA is to capture information of interest from English and  . lal ) a Jmsenew spal ) erart Mesabout micro electronics and corpora . rejoint ventures . 1A system must fill a . generic template with information taken 1Several AlPA-sponsored sites f ? ) rmedtile TIP-ST\]'21/informalon extra clion project . "\[' he TIPSTER sites and other non-sponsored organizations participated in  MUC-5  . 
1064 fronlthetext its . a fully automated fa . sh-ion . The template is composed of several objects , each containing sever M slots . Slots may have pointers as va . lues , where pointers link related ot ) jects . Extracted information is expected to be stored in an object-oriented database \[ TIPSTER  92\]  . 
In the micro electronics domain , information about four specific processes in seinic on duc-totm an ufacturing for microchip fabrication is captured  . They are layering , lithography , etching , aaMpackaging processes . \], ayering , lithography , and etching a . rewafer fa . brical : ion processes ; packaging is part of tile last stage of manufacturing  . Entities such as manufacturer , distributor , and user , in addition to detailed manufacturing information such a  . smaterials used and the microchip specifications such as wafer size and device speed are also extra  . cted in each process . 
The joint ventures domain focuses on extracting entities  , i . e . organizations , forming or dissolving joint venture relations hil ) s . The information to l ) e extracted includes entity information such as location  , na . tionality , personnel , and facilities , and joint venture information such as rela . tions h i i ) s , 1) usiness a . ctivi-ties , capital , and estimated revenue of the joint vent ttre . 
3 TEXTRACTARCHITECTURE
TEXTI/ACT is an informati ( mextraction system developed as an option a . l system of the GE-CMU SHOGUN system\[J a cobs 93a  \] , \[ aacobs93b\] . it processes the TIPSTFI . 
Japanese domains of microelectronics and col porate joint ventures  . The : I'I' ; XTllA ( VI~mi-croelectronics system comprises three major components : prel  ) rocessing ~ concelt tsearch , and template generatiol . In ad(lition to (: on .

In the preprocessor , Japanese text is segmented into primitive : words tagged with their t  ) arts of speech by a Japanese segment or called MAJESTY\[Kitani and Mitamura  93\]  , \[Kitani91\] . Then , proper norms , along with monetary , nulneric , and temporal expressions

10654 PATTERN MATCHINGIN
TEXTRACT 4.1 Concept search
Keywords representing the same concept are grouped into a list and used to recognize the concept in a sentence  . The list is written in a simple format : ( concept-name word l word 2 . . . ) . For example , keywords t brrecognizing a dissolved joint vent ure concept can be written in the following way  :   ( DISSOLVED ~-~ j~-~~- . ~: ~) or ( DISSOLVED dissolve terminate cancel ) . 
The concept search module recognizes the concept when a word in the fist exists in tile sentence  . Using such a simple word list some-tilnes generates an incorrect concept  . For example , a dissolved concept is erroneously iden-tiffed fl ' om an expression " cancel a hotel reservation "  . I Iowever , when processing text in a . 
narrow < lomain , concepts are often i < lent iff e < t correctly fi'om the simple list  , since keywords are usually used in a particular meaning of interest in the domain  . 
During the Ja . panese segmentation process in the preprocessor , a keyword in the text tends to be divided into a few separate words by MAJESTY  , when the word is not stored in the dictionary , For example , the compound noun " ~ jJ'~f ~" consists of two words  , " i ~3'' ( joint venture ) and ": r#~b1" ( dissolve )  . It is segmented into the two individual nouns using the current MAJE STY dictionary  . Thus , when the compound word " ~ . - ~ jlf ( t'-fb \]'' is searched for in the segmented sentence  , the concept search fails to identify it . To avoid this segmentation proble in , adjacent nouns are automatically put together during the concept search process  . 
This processal \] ows , by defanlt , partial word matching between a keyword and a word in the text  . Therefore , " ~ . -~ j " and " ~05 ~ J " both meaning " a . joint venture " can be identi-tied by a single keyword " ~  . 'I ~, Y ' . I lowever , due to the nature of partial matching , the keyword "- . :/~=:/"( Silicon ) matches "- iL ~ . 
4\[::"5+~=:/"(Silicondioxide) , which is a different type offfhn reported in the microelec-tronies domain  . This undesirable behavior can be avoided by attaching "> " to the beginning or "<" to the end of keywords  . Thus , , , > . 3 . 1) :~ :/ < , , tells the matcher that it requires an exact word matching against a word in the text  . 
4 . 2 Template pattern search 4 . 2 . 1 Template pattern matcher The teml>late pattern matcher identifies typical expressions to be extracted from the text that frequently aplmar in the corpus  . The patterns are defined as pa . ttern matching rules using regular expressions . 
The pattern matcher is affnite-state automaton s in filar to the pattern recognizer use  . d in the MUC4 FASTUS system developed at SRI\[I\[obbs et al 92\]  . /nTEXTRACT , state transitions arc driven by segmented words or grouped units fi'om the prei  ) rocessor . The matcher identifies all possible patterns of interest in the  . text that match defined l > atterns . 
It must ignore unnecessary words in the pattern to perform success fifl pattern matching for various expressions  . 
4.2.2 Pattern matching rules
Fig .   2 shows a defined pattern in which an arhitrary string is represented as " g ~ string " along with its corresponding English pattern  . 2 Specilica . lly , a variable starting with "@ CNAMI :; " is ca . lled the COulpally-name varial ) le , used where a company nanmise xi ) ected to a pl ) ear . For exain-pie , " CNAME_I'AITNER_SUBJ"matches any string that likely includes at least  ; one company name acting a . sa joint venture partner and functioning as a subject in tile sentence  . 
The pattern " ~ I h:stri ( : t : P " tells the pattern matcher to identify the word  , where " ~" or " z ) <" are grammatical particles that serve as sul ) je ( -t case markers . The ( te-fault type " strict " requires a . nexact string match , whereas " loose " allows a partial string match . Partial string matching is useful when compound words must be matched to a defined pattern  . A joint venture , " ~ . - ~ j:loose:VN " , whose l > art of speech is verbal nominal , matches compound words such as " ~ . .~ ~'~--~ j " ( corporate joint venture ) a . swell , % s " N ~ , j " ( joint venture) . 
2'\]'his\] , ' mglish pattern is used to capture x pressions such as " X Y Z Corp  . created a joint venture with PQR @ CNAME_PARTNER_SUBJ ~\ [~: strict : P@ CNAME_PARTNERWITH : strict : P@SKIP ~  . - ~: loose : VS )   ( a ) A matching pattern for Japanese ( Joint Venturel 3 @ CNAME_PARTNER_SUBJ create::Vajoint venture:NP with::P@CNAME_PARTNER_WITH  )   ( b ) A matching pattern for English Fig . 2: Are ; etching pattern for ( a ) , laf ) an esea , n ( l ( b ) English Theill-st field in ai ) atteril is the pattern nalile followed by the patterlliiu liiber  .

4.2.3 Pattern selection
Approxiiila . tely150 pa . tterns were used to extract various concepts in the Japanese joint ventures domain  . Several patterns usually tllat cha . single sentence . Moreover , siuce pal ;- terns are often searched using case ma . rkersslic \] i as "~" ,  "7~<" , and " ~" , which frequently apt ) e a . rill . \] al ) a . neset xts , even asitigiel ) a . t-1;eri/Calll\[latch the Sellt , enceill n\]oi ' ethrillOllewI , y whell severa , I of " tile same ca , selliarker sexistill a sentence . However , since the template gtmerator a CC ellts only the best lnat  (  ; he(Ipal ; -tern ~ ehoosiliga corre(:tlynla , tehedi ) at l , erilisiml Jortant . The selection in ( lone by applying three heuristic rules in the following or < let : ? sele  ( : tl ) a , tterns th ~ t t in ( : hide the IlK ) stI/lli\[lbei'of'nla , tchedCOlll\])al/y-ll311K ) Val'i

Another important feature of the pa . t:ternIilat(:horistha , trules can be group e ( 1 accord-ilig to their CO il Cel ) t . A rule lla . iile " Johlt Veli-turel " iii Fig .  2 , for example , represents a concel ) t " Joint Velitllre ' . Ushlg this group-big , the best nlatched pattern can be selected fl ' on-i nlatched patterns of a particular concept group instea  . d of choosing from all the matched patterns . This feature enables the discourse and template g ( meration processes to look at the , best infort nationecessary whet , tilling in a particular slot . 
5 EXAMPLE OF THE INFORMA-
TIONEXTRACTION PROCESS
This sectkm describes how concepts ~ tnd patterns ident if h  ; d by tile matcher are used for tenll ) late filling . Concepts are often useful to fill in the " set fill "  ( choice fi'om a . given set ) sh ) ts . An entity type slot , for examl)le , ha , sfour giw , ichoices : COMPANY , I ) EISON , GOVERNM/i ; NT , ~tndOTIIt ; R . The matcher assigns concepts related to each entity type except  ( ) Tf lEIL Thus , from the given set , the output generator chooses an entity type corresponding to the identified concept  . There axeca . ses when discourse processing is necess a . ry to link identified concepts and patterns . Thef . ollowing text ; : " X Inc . created a joint w ; ntm'e with Y Corp . last yea . r . X an nounced yesterday that it . terminated the venture . " in used to describe the extraction processil lust rated in Fig  .  3 . 
In the preprocessing , two companyna . tnes in the first sentence " X hic . " and " Y Corp . " are identified either I ) y MAJESTY or the name recognizer . In the first sentence , the tem-pla . tep a . tter use arch locates the , Ioint genture 1 pattern shown in Fig .  2 . Now , the , /OINT-VI' ; NT\[J11'3 concepl ; I ) etweeii " X in c . " and " YC'ol'l ) . " is recognized . In tim second Sellt(~ . it(X ~ . , joint venture with yesterday that it
Y Corp . last year . " iterminated the venture."
I Pre-company 1: " X Inc . "" X " company 2: I processlng company 3: " Y Corp . " : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : :

IVENTURE * & LCorp "
Discourse " X Inc . " ( companyl=company3 ) process ngJOINT-VENTURE*yDISSOLVED*"Y Corp  . "* concept name Fig . 3: Fxam I ) le of the inforntatiou extraction process the company name " X " is also identitied by the preprocessor  , a Next , the concept " DIS-SOLVE i ) " is recognized by the keyword terminate in the concept search  . ( The keyword list is shown in Section 4 . 11 . ) After sentence-level processing , discourse processing recognizes that " X " in the second sentence is a reference to " X Inc  . " found in the first sentence . 
Thus , the " DISSOLVI '; I)"concept is joined to the , joint venture relationship between " X in c . " and " Y Corp . " . in this way , TI ! iXTRACT recognizes that the two companies dissolved the  , joint venture . 
SupI ) ose that the second sentence is re-place ( t with another sentence : " Shortly after , X terminated a contract to supply rice to Z Corp . " . Although it does not mentiot ~ the dissolved relationship nor anything a hottt " Y Corp  . " , the system incorrectly recognizes the dissolved joint vent ttrerela  . tionship between " XIn (' . " and " V Corp . " due to the existence of the word terminate . When this undesirable matching is often seen , more complicated template patterns must be used instead of tile simple word list  . A dissolved concept , lbrexample , could he identified using the fo\]\[owing template pattern : a When it is an unknown word to timpre pro  ( x ~ ss or , the discourse processor id cnti \[ iesit IM . er . 
( Dissolved l2
OCNAME PARTNER_SUBJ dissolve Iterminatel cancel : : V@skipventure::N@CNAME_PARTNER_WITH  )  . 
Then , discourse processing must check if com+panies identified in this pattern are the same as the current joint venture comi  ) anies in order to recognize their dissolved relationship  .

1 069 has not been tested to languages other than Japanese  . It is expected to work to other languages with some minor modifications given that the input is segmented into primitive words tagged with their parts of speech  . 
The TEXTRACT Japanese microelectron-ics system was developed in only three weeks by one person  . In spite of its simplicity , it showed the high performance . This result also suggests that the pattern matching architecture is highly portable across similar domains of the same la  . nguage , thus facilitating rapid system development . Developing and maintaining TEXTRACT's pattern matching based architecture is easier and less complex than that of a full parsing system  , as experienced in the early stage of StIOGUN system development \ [ aacobs  93b\]  . 
Corpus analysis took about half of the development ime  , since only a KWIC ( KeyWordInContext ) list and a word fi'equency tool were used to acquire the concept-word lists and the template patterns  . Using good statistical corpus analysis tools will shorten the development time and promise a high performance  . The tools should not only collect patterns of interest with context  , but also give statistical data to show how well deftned patterns are working when they are applied in the system  . 
At MUC-5 meeting , P&R Fmeasure of one of the top-ranking systems was claimed to be close to the human perforn lance \[ Jacobs  93b  \] . rTo match the system performance of a pattern matching system to human perform all ce  , the preprocessor must recognizexpressions to be extracted at nearly  100% accuracy given that other component simply merge information and generate on tput  .
