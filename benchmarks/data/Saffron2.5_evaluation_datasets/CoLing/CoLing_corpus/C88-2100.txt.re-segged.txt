Since this depends not on regularities of meaning , but mth cJ on the idiosyncrasies of nteaniug realization in the varlons natural angtmges  , the general rules will be more diffical t to come by and furumlate  , ) An additional class of collocations are the paradigmalicollo caolions  .

Cummiug ,  1986) , bat relatively few systems actually include collocational information in their decision processes  . 
3.2 ElLipsis and Anaphora
Certain contexts completely alleviate the problem of open-class lexical selection  . Consider the following ( gloss of an ) input segment : ( 2 ) Clause 1: Buy Oohn 3 book 7 )  , time , focus : book 7 Clause 2: Bring ( John 3 book 7 office ~) , belong-to ( office ~ John 3) ,   time2: time ~> time h focus : office Clause3:Read  ( John 3hook 7 )  , aspect : in choative , time : after ( time z ) One of the adequate ways of realizing it is : ( 3 ) John bought a book . He brought this book to his office and started to read it  . 
T tiefe are seven instances of the three object -type concepts in the case-role slots of the input propositions above  . Each of the three concepts is realized lexically only once  . In two cases these meanings were realized through prononlinalization and in one each through definite description and a relliptic'/ construction  . This example shows that nonlexical realization is an integral part of the process of lexical selection m generation  . 
In what fellows we briefly describe the system architecture  , , the knowledge structures and the algorithm we use for selecting open-class lexical items in generation  . 
4 The System and the Knowledge
DIOGF . NI~S is a dislributed natural language generation system featuring a blackboard-type control structure  . The processing in it is concertoteated in the knowledge sources which are triggered by the state of the various black boards  . The latter contain the input to generation as well as all intermediate and final results of DIOGEN&S operation  , represented uniformly in a frame-oicoted knowledge representation language  . Background knowledge in 9\[OG~qES includes the following components relevant to the task of lexical selection : a concept lexicon  , a set of knowledge structures that describe object  , qn  deveut-types in the ( sub ) world of the texts to be generated ( the fn'st application of DIOG ~' qES is ; for example , in the domain of computer hardware maan~ds ) o a generation lexicon that F , ~ ks ( sub ) world concepts ( or , more accurately , their instances ) with particular lexical units of the target Danguage  . 
The above description is necessarily incomplete . See Nkanhurg ,   1997 for an extensive specification of all the facets of DIOGr l NES  .

4 73   5 The Algorithm in the DIOGENES generator art in slar ~ tiation fahead-selecfing knowl  . -edge source is triggered simultaneously for every event  , and role instance in the input representation . The results of their operafiou are posted to a public blackboard  , so that ail knowledge source instances can draw on I his knowledge in their own decisiou processes  . The knowledge sources responsible for selecting modifiers are triggered when the heads of their phrases have already been selected  . 
Figut ~ 3 illustrates dm algorithm to rasing le lexical selection  ( head or modifier ) knowledge source . If an input frame was already menlot onext in the input  , the question arises whether it should be realized non-lcxically  , that is , using deictic means ( this is the case with these coond appeanmce of John in  ( 2 ) ) . If so , a proper realization must be , found and posted on the corresponding blackboard . If this process fails at artypoint , We rever to the ' regular ' case of lexical realization  . This latter consists , first of all , in scanning the generation lexicon in seme h of a set of candidate ralizations for the input frame  . (1) is an example of such a set . When such a set is produced , we attempt to filter it by removhlg those candidates that are not compatible with realizations already decided upon for other input fi'ames in the same sentence  . This processing is based on comparing the collocation infonnation in the lexicon entries for the members of various candidate realization seLq  . 
F ~ r example , if a neighbor frame has already been realize x las demonstrator  , then the collocational intbrmation will filter out all mc mlxa's of  ( 1 ) but youth , teenager , man . If the residual set has cardinality one , we post the result . Otherwise -- as in the case when no collocation nlint brmatkm cnn be used -- we pmc exxl to select he~v ~ aliz ~ tion based solely on the entries in the cnndidate ralization set  ( ttmt is , without he

6 Stattas and Future Work
The blackboard architecture and the inexact meaning matching module luts been implemented  ; the collocation treatment module has also been implemented  , but extensive testing has not been performed ue to the lack of alm  . ge-seal elxicon . The anaphor a treatment module has been implemented for pronominalizationly  , and then nmber of pronominal i , ~ation rules employed has to be and will be increased  . 
It is chair that the acquisition of the generation lexicon is a major and extremely abor-intensive task in natural language genelution  . The acquisition of this dictionary , especially of the colloeafional information cannot at present be done automatically  . But the efficiency of the team of human lcxicograplters working on this problem can be increased dramatically through the use of specialized intelligent interactive aids  . 
We have developed one such Knowledge Base Maintenance System  ( el . Nirenbtwg et al ,  1987 ) for rite acquisition of concept lexicons and will extend it so that it becomes applicable to the task of acquiring genernl Jon ~ exicons as well  .
