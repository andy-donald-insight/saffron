This paper proposes a method for extracting bilingual text pairs from a comparable corpus  . The basic idea of the method is to apply bootstrapping to an existing corpus-based cross -language information retrieval  ( CLIR ) approach . We conducted preliminary tests with English and Japanese bilingual corpora  . The bootstrapping method led to much better esults for the task of extracting translation pairs compared with a corpus-based CLIR method without bootstrapping  , and the extracted translation pairs could be useft fl training data for improving results of the corpus-based CLIR method  . 
1 Introduction
A parallel corpus is an important resource for corpus-based approaches to CLIR  . These approaches use parallel corpora as statistical training data and then retrieve documents written in a language different from that of the query  . 
One disadvantage of these approaches i lack of resources  . Parallel corpora are not always readily available and those that are available tend to be relatively small or to cover only a small number of subjects  . 
A bilingual comparable corpus is a set of texts in two different languages from the same domain or on the same topic  . Unlike a parallel corpus it is composed independently in the respective language text sets  . It can be more readily obtained from the Internet or CDROM resources than parallel corpora  . Zanettin ( 1998 ) introduced several available bilingual comparable corpora such as newspaper articles selected by dates and subject codes  , medical articles from journals and textbooks , and articles for tourists from brochures and guides  . Zanet-t in ( 1994 ) also reported that it is highly likely that much relevant information can be found across languages in a topic-related bilingual comparable corpus  . In this paper , we propose a method for extracting bilingual text pairs which share the same information fiom a bilingual coln parable corpus  , and show the possibility that the resulting bilingual text pairs can be useful for corpus -based CLIR approaches when we use them as training data instead of a parallel corpus  . 
Sheridan ( 1998 ) also proposed an approach to building l nultilingual test collection from comparable corpora consisting of news articles  . 
The idea is to reduce the work of manual relevance judgements by restricting news articles to be examined to a couple of days  . Disadvan-tages to this approach are that it relies on time-sensitive texts  , texts obtained by this approach are constrained to referencing specific events  , and nontrivial work by hulnans is still necessm'y . 
On the other hand , our goal is to extract bilingual text pairs automatically from any kind of bilingual comparable corpora  . 
This paper is organized as follows : Section 2 introduces the basic idea for extracting relevant ext pairs from a bilingual comparable corpus  . Our method is based on a corpus-based CLIR method  , so we overview previous corpus-based CLIR approaches in Section  3  . Section 4 describes an experimental procedure , the results it produced , and an analysis of the results . The conclusion is given in Section 5 . 
2 The Basic Idea
As we will describe in Section 3 , several CLIR approaches that rely on parallel corpora have been proposed and lead to successful retrieval results  . In those approaches , a parallel corpus used as training data should be large enough to obtain good retrieval results  . Although we use a CLIR method which relies on a parallel corpus  , we begin with a very small parallel corpus . We retrieve bilingual text pairs from a bilingual comparable corpus using the small parallel corpus as training data  . Then we concatenate the text pairs to the initial small parallel corpus and grow the parallel corpus by iterating the retrieval and concatenation processes  ( Figure 1 )  .

Figure 1: The bootstrapping method
This kind of bootstrapping method has a problem , however : It is highly sensitive to the accuracy of the text pairs obtained in the early stages of the iterations  . In order to solve this problem , we concatenate only a small number of the most " reliable " text pairs to the initial parallel corpus in the early stages  , then gradually increase the number of the text pairs which are concatenated to the initial parallel corpus  . We will describe the details of the method in Section  4  . 
3 Corpusbased CLIR approaches 3 . 1 Previous Researches As we mentioned in Section 2 , we use a CLIR method which relies on a parallel corpus in our bootstrapping method  . One approach to cor-pus-based CLIR is to use the Latent Semantic Indexing technique proposed by Fumas et al  ( 1988 ) on a parallel corpus to construct a language ill dependent representation el ' queries and documents  ( Landauer and Lfltman ,  1990) . 
Another approach that relies on a parallel corpus has been suggested by l  ) unning and l ) avis ( 1993 )  . Their method is based on the vector space model and involves the linear traus forula-tion of the representation fa query  . A parallel corpus can also be used to enhance existing knowledge-based resources  . The resources ark used to translate the query and then classical IR matching techniques are applied to compute the similarity between the trauslated query and documents  ( Hull and Grel'enstette ,  1996) . 
3.2 hfforlnation Mapping for CLIR
For our bootstrapping method , we adopted a CLIR method which is based on the hfforma-tionMapping approach  ( Masuichi et al ,  1999) . Information Mapping is basically awlriant of the vector space model  , and is based on an approach first proposed by Schtitze  ( 1995 )  . The approach is closely related to Latent Semantic Indexing  , and the dilTerence between these two is discussed in Schfitze and Pedersen  ( 1997 )  . Note that our bootstrapping method does not depend on any particuhu " properties  o1' the Information Mapping approach , so it could employ other corpus-based CLIR methods such as Latent Semantic indexing  . 
Information Mapping begins with a large word-by -word matrix  . A list of n content-bearing words and mw ) cabulary words correspond to the columns and the rows of the matrix  . The most fiequently appearing n words in a training corpus are selected as content-bearing words and the most frequently appearing m words as vocabulary words  . 
Each cell of the matrix holds then mn be r of total cooccurrences between a content-bearing word and a vocabulary word in the training corpus  . In this way , an n-dimensional vector which represents the word 's distributional behavior is produced t ' or each vocabulary word  . Then the original n-dimensional vector space is converted into a condensed  , lower-dilnensional , real-valued matrix using Singular Valuel ) ecomposition ( SVD )   ( Berry ,  1992) . 
The lower-dimensional vector space is called word space  . A document vector and a query vector are calculated by summing the vectors corresponding to the vocabulary words in the document or the query  , and the proximity between the two vectors is del ' ined as the cosi-ne of the angle between them  . 
To apply this method to CL1R , we regard each translation pair in a training parallel corpus of language LI and  L2 as a single COln potmd document and create a word -by-word matrix and then a word space  . The word space represents a hm guage independent vector space for vocabulary words in both  1  , 1 and L2 , and therefore query and document vectors in both LI and  L2 can be calculated and compmed in the salne word space  . 
4 Experimental tests and Results 4 . 1 Tests with complete-pair corpora We used an English-Japanese bilingual patent text corpus for our experilnent altests  . For our first test , we prepared I000 English-Japanese patent text pairs as a pseudo bilingual comparable corpus  . For each Japanese patent text in the corpus , its English translation by humans exists j , so this corpus could be regarded as an ideal bilingual comparable corpus  . We also prepared 100 pairs as an initial parallel corpus ( a training corpus ) to create an initial word space . All the patents The quality of the translations wtrics greatly from word-for-word translations to shorts unnnaries  . 
1 067 in the two corpora were randomly selected from the Japanese patents issued in  1991  , and the two corpora shared no patent . We used only the title and abstract exts and removed all other information  , such as author , patent ID and issue date . Table 1 shows an example of an English-Japanese pair in the corpora  . All characters in the English texts are l-byte characters and all characters  , including alphabetical and numerical characters , in the Japanese texts are 2-byte , so there is no word which is shared by both English and Japanese texts  . 
We used all words which appeared in a training corpus as vocabulary words  , and the most frequently appearing 3000 English words as content-bearing words and then reduced the dimension of the vectors from  3000 to 200 by

Table 1: An example of an English-
Japanese patent pair
We began with a word space created from the 100 English-Japanese translation pairs ( the initial parallel corpus )  . Then using the word space , we calculated 1000 English patent vectors and 1000 Japanese patent vectors which correspond to the patent texts in the pseudo comparable corpus  . Next we extracted English-Japanese patent pairs which satisfied the simple condition that the English patent vector in the pair has the highest proximity  ( the biggest cosine ) with the Japanese patent vector in the pair among the  1000 Japanese patent vectors , and vice versa ( hereafter we call these pairs mutual-proximity pairs  )  . 
Note that mutual-proximity pairs are , of course , not always correct translation pairs . 
Then we selected the 10 most " reliable " mu-tual-proximity pairs , assuming that the higher the proximity between the two vectors of a mutual-proximity pair  , the more reliable the mutual-proximity pair is . Finally we concatenated the 10 mutual-proximity pairs to the initial 100 translation pairs . This is the first stage of our bootstrapping method  . 
In the second stage , we created a new word space regarding the 110 English-Japanese pairs obtained in the first stage as a training corpus  . Then we selected the 20 most reliable mutual-proximity pairs and concatenated them to the initial  100 paten translation pairs . 
At the Nth stage , we selected the N * 10 most reliable lnutual-proximity pairs . If the number of the nmtual-proximity pairs obtained in the stage is less than  N*I0  , all of the mutual-proximity pairs were concatenated to the initial  100 paten translation pairs . 
We repeated this procedure up to the 100th stage . At the 100th stage , we obtained 727 mutual-proximity pairs and 721 pairs out of the 727 pairs were correct translation pairs . 
Therefore the recall of the obtained pairs was 72 . 1% (721/1000) and the precision was 99 . 2%  ( 721/727 )   ( see the column of Test l and the row of the " bootstrapping method " of Table  2  )  . On the other hand , we obtained 341 mutual-proximity pairs and 258 pairs out of the 341 pairs were correct ranslation pairs in the case of the normal Information Mapping method which corresponds to the first stage of our bootstrapping method  . In this case , the recall was 25 . 8% and the precision was 75 . 7%  ( see the column of Test l and the row of the " normal method " of Table  2  )  .

Table 2 shows results of the 5 tests of the bootstrapping method and the normal Information Mapping method  . In each case the bootstrapping method could drastically improve both the precision and the recall  . 
We also conducted tests to see if the resulting text pairs obtained at the  100th stage in the previous tests are useful for the normal Infermarion Mapping method  . We prepared another 1000 English-Japanese paten translation pairs for each of the  5 previous tests as evaluation corpora . No same patents were shared between any two of all the corpora  . 
We extracted mutual-proximity pairs froln the new 1000 English-Japanese pair with the normal Information Mapping method  , using ( 1 ) the initial parallel corpus in the previous test ,   ( 2 ) the initial parallel corpus + the mutual -proximity pairs obtained in the previous test  ,   ( 3 ) the initial parallel corpus + the 1000 Eng-lish-Japanese correct translation pairs in the pseudo comparable corpus of the previous test  , as a training corpus respectively . For example , in Test1 , the number of pairs in the refining corpus is 100 for ( 1 )  , 827 with 6 error pairs for (2) and 1100 for (3) . 
the Introduction , it is highly likely that a real bilingual comparable corpus includes bilingual pairs which share the same information  , but it also includes a lot of irrelevant texts . To simulate this , we replaced half of the Japanese paten texts in the pseudo comparable corpora of the previous tests with different Japanese patent texts which were randomly selected  . 
Therefore the corpus included 500 English-Japanese translation pairs , and 500 English patents and 500 Japanese patents which were totally irrelevant to each other  .

The results of ( 3 ) can be considered as the ceilings of the precision aud the recall  , because we used all the correct translation pairs in the pseudo comparable corpus  . In each case , both the precision and the recall of ( 2 ) is very close to the ceilings , so we think the bilingual text pairs obtained by our bootstrapping method is useful as a training corpus for the normal 
Information Mapping method.

The results of these tests are not as good as the results of tests with the ideal pseudo comparable corpora  . Figure 4 and 6 show , however , the bootstrapping method iml ? roved both the precision and recall of the extracted text pairs as compared to the normal method  . Figure 5 and 7 also show that the bilingual text pairs obtained by the bootstrapping method are still useful as a training corpus for the normal method  . 
5 Conclusion
We proposed alnethod of extracting bilingual text pairs from a comparable corpus  . The method is based on an existing corpus-based CLIR method and uses bootstrapping  . Although our research is in the preliminary stage of development and tested with artificial corpora consisting of English and Japanese paten texts  , the bootstrapping ledtonmch better results for the task of extracting translation pairs than the results produced by a normal CLIR method  , and the extracted translation pairs could be useful for improving the results of the normal CLIR when we used them as a training corpus  .
