Abstract
Lexicalized Tree Adjoining Grammar ( LTAG ) is an attractive formalism for linguistic description mainly because cff its extende domain of locality and its factoring recursion out from the domain of local dependencies  ( Joshi ,  1985 , Kroch and Joshi ,  1985 , Abeilld ,  1988) . LTAG's extende domain of locality enables one to localize syntactic dependencies  ( uch as filler-gap )  , as well as semantic dependencies ( uchas predicate-arguments )  . The aim of this paper is to show that these properties combined with the lexicalized property of LTAG are especially attractive for machine translation  . 
The transfer between two languages , such as French and English , can be done by putting directly into correspondence large elementary units without going through some interlingual representation and without major changes to the source and target grammars  . The underlying formalism for the transfer is " synchronous Tree Adjoining Grammars "  ( Shieber and Schabes\[1990\] )  1 . Transfer rules are stated as correspondences betwee nodes of trees of large domain of locality which are associated with words  . We can thus define lexical transferules that avoid the defects of a mere word-to-word approach but still benefit from the simplicity and elegance of a lexical approach  . 
We rely on the French and English LTAG grammars ( Abeille\[1988\] , Abeille\[1 . 990 ( b )\], Abeilld et al .  \[1990\] , Abeill 6 and Schabes\[1989 ,  1990\] ) that have been designed over the past two years jointly at University of Pennsylvani and University of Paris  7-Jussieu  .

and has been exemplified by Kaplan , et al , (1989) for LFG , Beaven et al . for UCG (1988) , Dorr for GB ( 1989 ) and Arnold et al for Eurotra ( 1986 )  . tIow-ever , our approach is more radical in the sense that we associate with the lexical items structures that lo-calize syntactic and semantic dependencies  . This allows for the possibility that an explicit semantic representation level can be avoided  .   2 The claims about the advantages of an explicit semantic representation level need to be investigated again in the context of the approach proposed here  . For examples , many traditionally difficult problems for machine translation due to different divergence types  ( Dorr 1989 ) such as categorial , thematic , conflational , structural and lexical are not problems in the approach we suggest  , Also contrary to UCG , but like LFG , we use grammars that have not been designed for the purpose of translation  . 
The underlying formalism achieving the transfer of derivationsi " Synchronous Tree-Adjoining Grammars "  ( as described in a companion paper by Shieber and Schabes  \[1990\]  )  . ~ The strategy adopted for machine translation consists of matching the source LTAG derivation of the source sentence to a target LTAG derivation by looking at a transfer lexicon  . 
The transfer lexicon puts into correspondence a tree from the source grammar instantiated by lexical insertion  ( all its nodes and their attributes ) with a tree from the target grammar . Although the approach is not inherently directional  , for convenience we will call the English and French grammars  , the source and target grammars . 
The translation proces . s consists of three steps in which the generation step is reduced to a trivial step  . First the source sentence is parsed accordingly to the source grammar  . Each elementary tree in the derivation is now considered with the features given from the derivation through unification  . Second , the source derivation tree is transferred to a 2The formalism of Synchronous Tree-Adjolning Grammar does not prevent constructing an explicit semantic representation  . In fact , in Shieber and Schabes ( 1990 ) it is shown how to construct a semantic representation  , which itself is a TAG . 
3We assume that the reader is familiar with Tree Adjoining Grammars  . We refer the reader to Joshi ( 1987 ) for an introduction to TAGs . We also refer the reader to the companion paper for more details on synchronous TAGs  . 
11 target derivation . This step maps each elementary tree in the source derivation tree to a tree in the target derivation tree by looking in the transfer lexicon  . 
And finally , the target sentence is generated from the target derivation tree obtained in the previou step  . 
As an example , consider the fragment of the transfer lexicon given in Figure  1  .

Fragment of the English-French transfer
The transfer lexicon consists of pairs of trees one from the source language and one from the target language  . Within the pair of trees , nodes may be linked ( thick lines ) . Whenever in a source tree , say Got , roe , adjunction or substitution is performed on a linked node  ( sayn so ~ is linked to n , ~ , t ) , the corresponding tree paired with tsouree , ttaraet , operates on the linked node ntara et . For example , suppose we start with the pair 7 and we operate the pair a on the link from the English node NPo to the French node NPI  . This operation yields the derived pair o ~1 .

Finally , when the pair 6 operates on the SS link in a ~ , the pair a3 is generated .

The source sentence is parsed accordingly to the source grammar  , then the target derivation is generated by tracing the pairs stated in the transfer lexicon  . The fragment of the transfer lexicon given in Figure  1 therefore nables us to translate :
Apparently , John misses Mary
Apparemment , Mary manque ~ John
In most cases , translation can be performed incrementally as the input string is being parsed  . 
The aim of this paper is to show that LTAG's localization of syntactic dependencies  ( such as filler-gap )  , as well as semantic dependencies ( such as predicate-arguments ) combined with the lexiealized property of LTAGs are especially attractive for machine translation  . 
We show how the transfer lexicon is stated . We motivate the need for mapping trees instantiated with words and with the value of their features obtained from the derivation tree corresponding to the parse of the source sentence  . We also show that the transfer needs to be stated at different levels : matching tree families  ( trees associated to the same predicate )  , trees , nodes and therefore their attributes , since they are associated with a node . We show how not only subcategorization frames but also adjuncts are transferred  , and how differences of syntactic and semantic properties are accounted for ill terms of structural discrepancies  . Then we illustrate how the extende domain of locality enables us to deal with these structural discrepancies in the process of machine translation  . 
2  2   2 Transfer Lexicon-matching two LTAG Lexicons The transfer is stated between the English and French LTAG grammars in a lexicon  . We rely on grammars built from a monolingual perspective  , but the match between them can be one to many , or many to one . 
2.1 Matching elementary trees
Instead\[of matching words , we match structures in which words have been already lexically inserted  . 
This provides interesting disambiguations that could not be obtained by a morphological match  . For example , there is one morphological English verb leave , but the structures associated with it disambiguate it between intransitive and transitive leave  . Interestingly , these two predicates receive two different

By convention , in the elementary trees , the set of morphological flexions of a given word is written surrounded by baek slashes  . For example , \ leave\stands for leave , leaves , left ,   . . . . For each word in a morphological set attributes ( such as mode and agreement ) are also specified . When a word in a tree is not surrounded by back slahes  , it stands for the in-fleeted form and not for a morphological set  . 
Since lexieal items appearing in the elementary structures can be inflected words or a morphological set  , lexieal items of the two languages are matched regardless of whether they exhibit the same  morpho-4We use standard TAG notation : '1' stands for nodes to be substituted , '*' annotates the foot node of an auxiliary tree and the hadice shown on the nodes correspond to semantic functions  . The trees are combined with adjunction and substitution  .

logical variations or not . For example , English adjectives lacking morphological variation appear as such in the syntactic and transfer lexicons  , while their French counterparts are usually morphological sets  . 
The word white is thus matched with \ blanc\ , standing for blanc , blanche , blancs , blanches ) . 
Words that are not autonomous entries in the English syntactic lexicon  ( ex : complementizers , light verbs or parts of an idiomatic expression ) , are not considered as autonomous entries in the transfer lexicon  ; for example , no rule needs to match directly take or pay with faire  , or give with pousser , in order to get the right light-verb predicative noun combinations in the following sentences :  5 
Johnt . ool ~ a walk
John a failune prome nade ( Danlos 1989)
John pays court_t ? Mary ~ , John faitia courtd Mary ( Danlos 1989)
John ~~- ~ Jeanapoussduncri
Some words existing as autonomous entries in the English syntactic lexicon do not appear as entries in the transfer lexicon because their French counterpart is a morphological fexion  , not a word . For example , the future auxiliaries will or shall are not translated as such  . The tense feature they contribute is transferred ( as well other syntactic features ) and the future tense French verbal form will be chosen  . 
2.2 Matching nodes
Matching predicates of the two languages as a whole is not sufficient  . Correspondences between their arguments must be stated too as shown in the following example :  ~6   ~7 $ VP NP a $ VPI . 
V . NPI$VPP .,/
Ix . I$vPj---NP0$VP/\At/VNPI$VPP , " k . " i/x\~miss\~ . _ ~ man que Arl ~ NPI ~ John resembles Mary *-+ John ressembled Mary John misses Mary *-+ Mary manque fi John  5It has long been noticed that light-verb predicative noun combinations are highly langalage -idiosyncratic  , nd word-to-word transfer rules will inevitably lead to overgeneration run natural restrictions  . 

These examples also show that it is not correct to match trees where lexical insertion has not already been made and therefore the correspondences betwee nodes cannot be made on the only basis of the subcategorization frame  . 
Arguments are matche directly by the links existing between them  . Adjuncts are matched indirectly by the links existing on the nodes  , at which they adjoin . For example , in the following correspondence,
NP0S-'-~Svy ~ , / ~ e\APP ~ aime AI the AP node in the English tree is linked to the V node of the French tree to account for: 
John is fond of music
John aimeiam nsique
John is very fond of music
John aime beau coupla musique
The adjective fond is associated with an AP-type auxiliary tree which is paired with a V-type auxiliary tree corresponding to the word beaucoup  . 
2.3 Matching feature structures
Some feature structures of the words appearing in the trees are transferred in the translation process  , but with the value further specified from the derivation  ( and not with the one from the lexical entry which may not be as specific  )  . For example , fish can be either singular or plural and is therefore stated as such in the lexicon  . However , it can get its number from the verb-subject agreement constraints  , as in the following sentences :
The fish . swim in the pond *-+ Les poissonsnagent dans I ' dtang  ( plural ) 
The fish is good
Lepoissonest bon ( singular )
Agreement features of nouns are lexically matched only in the case of two morphological sets  . In the ease of one ( or both ) entry being a single inflected word , the agreement features depend only on the lexieal entry itself and are directly assigned in the transfer lexicon : \ boy\  , g\[hum=X\]~\ gar ~ on\ , N\[nura = X\]luggage , N\[hum=sing\]~bagages , NInure = pl\]Because of these idiosyncrasies , agreement features of verbs are not matched . We will thus rightly have:
Myluggage . 0 . heavy ( singular ) * -* Mesbagages on tIourds ( plural ) based on monolingual greement constraints between subject and verb  . 
Features assigned to the sententiai yoot node ( either from lexieal insertion or from Sdh~e adjoined ma-  , ' . % , "'3 terial ) are transferred or not depending on whether they are assigned autonomously ! n the target language or not  . The feature tense for example is usually transferred  , but not the feature ~: mode because the latter depends on the verb of the matrix sentence if the sentence is embedded : 
Jeanwants Marie to leave ~-* Jean veut que Marie parte  ( Danlos 1989 )  2 . 4 Match ing t ree fami l ies In order to transfer both the predicate-argument relations  , and the construction types such as question , passive , topicalization etc . , it is necessary to be able to refer to a specific tree in a tree family  . This is done by matching the syntactic features by which the different trees are identified within a tree family  , for example < passive > , < relative , NP i > or < question , 
NP ~>.6
As has been noted , transitivity alternations exhibit striking differences in the two languages  . The trees in the two families will not necessarily bear the same syntactic features  ; corresponding tree families may not include the same number of trees  . 
When a syntactic feature of a given tree family does not exist for the corresponding tree family in the target language  , it will be ignored . English trees for prepositional passives will thus be matched with their corresponding declarative trees in French  ( unless the English preposition alr gument is matched with the French direct object  ) :
John was given a book by Mary
Marya donn dnn livre ~ Jean
Similarly , the feature < question , NP i > will be transferred but not the feature differentiating between pied-piping and preposition-strandingiEnglish  , since French always pied-pipes :
Who did Mary give a book to ? ~ Marya-t-elle do nnd unlivre ? When a certain syntactic feature xists for both tree families in the two languages  , but not for both lexical items , it is ignored as well : Advantage was taken of this affair by John ? Pattia ~ td tird de cette affaire par Jean 
Jeanatir dpattide cetteaf faire
Such idiosyncrasies are in fact expected and handled in our grammars  , since they have both their constituent sructures and their syntactic rules iexi-calized  ( see Abeill 6\[1990 ( a ) \] for a discussion on this topic )  . 
6 NP i refers to the noun phrase being extracted , usually 0 for subject , 1 for first object etc . .
4  4   3 Dealing with Structural Dis-crepancies Units of a LTAG grammar have a large domain of locality  . Discrepancies in the internal structures being matched are in fact expected by our strategy  , and no special meclhanism is required for them . 
fi; . 1 D isc repanc ies in const i tuent s t ruc tures I1  . is not a problem when an elementary tree of a certain constituent structure translates into an elementary tree with a different constituent structure ix : t the target language  , provided they have a simi-l~p , r argument structure . For example : idiom ~- + verb ; idiom ~ different kind of idiom ; verb ~ light-verb combination ; VP-adverb ~- ~ raising verb ; S-adverb ? ~ matrix clause . . . as in:
The baby j_ust fell ~-+ Leb dbd ~ tomber ( I ( a planetai .  1989)

II a cough
Links provide for simultaneous adjunction ( or substitution ) of matching trees at the corresponding nodes . For example in the pair 0"11 , adjunction of an adjective ( on N ) in the English tree corresponds to an adjunction on the French VP: 
John gave a weak cough
John touss a faiblemenl
Furthermor elementary structures of the source language need not exist in the target language as elementary structures  . For example , there is no French counterpart to the English verb particle combination  . 
John called Maryup ~ John a appeid Mary 3 . 2 D isc repanc ies in syntact i c p rop-e r t ies Some English predicates do not have the same number of arguments as their corresponding French ones  . 
In such cases , the pair does not consists of pairs of elementary trees but rather pairs of derived trees of bounded size  . Since the match is performed between derived trees  , no new elementary trees are introduced in the grammars  . This addition of pairs of bounded derived trees is the only change we have to make to the units of the original grammars  . 
For example , the adverb hopefully has an S argument . Since there is no corresponding French adverb , the French verb espdrer ( which has two arguments , an NP and an S ) combined with on will be used : hopefully , John will work one spgreque Jeantravaiiler a .  1
O'12/oo\hopefully I/~'~e~sp6rerk~S ; que In the pair 0"12 , hopefully is paired with a derived tree corresponding to ones p ~ r e  . The English tree for hopefully is paired with the result of the substitution of on in the subject position of the tree for esp ~ rer  . 
The right hand tree in 0"12 is a derived tree.
Matching agentless passive with declarative trees is done with the same device : 
John was given a book ~ a donndun livreh John Similar cases occur for verbs exhibiting ergativity alternationione language and but not in the other  . 
In this case , a supplementary causative tree has to be used for the unaccusative language  ( see pair 0"13 ) :
The sunmelt ____ . As the snow * lesoleil fond laneige+-+le sole il fair fond relaneige  5   5   0?13

The right hand tree in al3 is again a derived tree . 
Multicomponent TAG ! Joshi\[1987\] ) can also be used for resolving certain other discrepancies  . This device is not a new addition , it is already a part of the Synchronous TAG framework  . 
Conclusion
By virtue of their extende domain of locality , Tree Adjoining Grammars allow regular correspondences between larger structures to be stated without a mediating interlingual representation  . The mapping of derivation trees from source to target languages  , using the formalism of synchronous TAGs , makes possible to state such direct correspondences  . By doing so , we are able to match linguistic units with quite different internal structures  . Furthermore , the fact that the grammars are lexicalized enables capturing some idiosyncrasies of each language  . 
The simplicity and effectiveness of the transfer rules in this approach shows that lexicMized TAGs  , with their extende domain of locality , are very well adapted to machine translation . A detailed discussion of this approach will be provided in an expanded version of this paper which will include a discussion of the applicability of this method for other pairs of languages exhibiting some language phenomena that do not arise in the pair considered in this paper  .
