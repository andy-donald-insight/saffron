Abstract
This paper discusses one of the problems of machine trans\]  . ation , n . m ~ mly the translation of idioms . The paper describes a solution to this problem within the theoretical framework of the Rosetta machine translation syst~n  . 
Rosetta is an experimental trans\]at\] on system which uses an intermediate lard  , mate and translates between Dutch , English and , in the future , Spanish . 
I~ntroduetion
Idioms have been told still are a basic theoretical sttnlb-ling block in most linguistic theories  . For the purposes of machine translation or , in genera \] , natural language processing , it is necessary to Ix~able to deal with : idioms because there are so i ~ any ofth ~ n in every language and because they are an essential part of it  . 
ldioms occur in sentences as a number of words , possibly scattered over the sentence and possibly with sonde inflec-te del ~ nents  ; this ntnfl ~ er of words has to be interpreted as havip4~  , one primitive meaning . For example , in (1) " nade ", " peace " and " ~ . Rth " have to be interpreted idlomatically . 
Note that words that are part of the idJ~n are underlined  . 
(1) lie has made his peace with his neighbour
The classic example Is ( 2 ) :  ( 2 ) Pete kicked the bucket Literally this sentence means that Pete hit a specific vessel ~?\[ thhis foot  . In the idiomatic reading the interpretation is that Petedied  . It is impossib\]e to infer this idiomatic meaning directly fron the prlm ~ tives " Pete "  , " kick " , "the " and " bucket " and from the way they are e omblned  . 
Idioms can undergosy~itae tie transformations , but sometimes they are reluctant to do so . The passive sentence ( 3 ) has lost its idiomatic reading , while in the ~ assive sentence ( 4 ) the idiomatic reading hasheen retained . 
(3 ) The bucket was kicked by Pete ( 4 ) Mary's heart was broken by Pete Other examples are  ( 512 )  . In the idiomatic reading in ( 5 ) clefting with the object as focus is not allowed , while it is allowed in ( 6 ) if " Mary " is stressed . Clefting with the subject as focus in both ( 7 ) and ( 8 ) is permitted . In ( 9 ) the PP " at whose door " and in ( I0 ) the NP " whose heart " can be subject to wh -movement  . In ( ii ) the NP " Mary's heart " can be topic allzed ( if " Mary " is stressed )  , but in (1 . 2 ) t be NP " the bucket " cannot undergo this transformation without losing the idicanatic reading  . Thus idioms behave syntactically like non -idiomatic structnres  , although sometimes they are restricted . 
(5 ) It was the bucket that Pete Idcked ( 6 ) It was Mart's heart that Pete broke ( 7 ) It was Pete that kicked the bucket ( 8 ) It was Pete that broke Mary's heart " ( 9 ) At whose door did Petelay his failure ( i0 ) those heart did Pete say that Mary broke ( ll ) Mary's heart Pete broke ( 12 ) The bucket Pete Icic loed Idioms can take free arguments or can have elenents  , llke possessive pronotms , which have to be hound hy arguments . 
In sentences (13-1 . 5) " Mary "\] . sa complement otheidio-matic verb , and realizes different grammatical functions in the sentence  ( i . e . indirect object , possessive NP and to-PP object respectively ) ? In ( 16 ) the pronoun " his " has to Imbound by the subject " l ? ete "  . 
(13 ) Pete gave Mary the finger ( 14 ) Petebroke Mary's heart ( 15 ) Pete Laid down the law I:o Mary (  16  ) Pete_19 st-his . t_empe_r_l . ing td stic theories on idioms should heable to account for the prohibits out \]\] ned above  . The proposals made are usually fragmentary , ill the sense that they only are concerned with part of the probl~n  , for instance Fraser (1970) , who only deals with the possible applica tion of transfo ~ vaations to idioms  , or they are a relatively minor part of ala rger theory  , for example Chomsky (1981 . ) , who gives a very general and prfneipled account of idioms  , Nit cannot cope with all the data . More elaborate studies on idioms are usually not directly relevant to machine translation  , for instance Boisset (1978) , who treat sidioms frc ~ na more pragm ~ qticl Yoint of view  . To illustrate it could be argued that Chomsky ( 1981 ) can cope with sentences such as ( 2 ) and ( 15 )  , but not wtt : h(13) ,  (1 . 4) and (16) ; Pesetsky (1985) can deal with (2) or (1316) , hut not with a sentence lilm : ( 17 ) Petelald his failurea:t Mary's d_oo ~ Chonsky ( 198\[ , p .  146 , note 94 ) claims that " we may think of an idiom rule for an idiom with a verbal head as a rule adding the string a V c to the phrase marker of each terminal string abc  , ~ dmreb is the idiom , now understanding a phrase marker to be a set of strings " and that idioms " appear either : In D -structure or S-strncture or LF-form  . " Furthermore " at : D-structure , idioms can be distinguished as subject or not snhject to Move alpha "  . 
Thus here it is possible to reanalyse a string a be ~ n to a V c as for example for sentence  ( 2 ) in figure ( 18 )  , where there analysis is indicated by a double tree and where a is " Pete "  , bis " kick the bucket " and c is empty : (1 . 8) s
NP VP
Petekic kf/

It seams that on this approachele ~ tents of idioms must be adjacent at a certain level  ( D-structure , S-structure or LF-form ) , which is the case for sentence (2) . t to wever , in sentence ( 14 ) the parts of the idiom " breok " and " heart " are not adjacent at any level  , since the free argument " Mary " is situated between the idiom parts and in  ( 16 ) " lose " and " temper " are not : adjacent at any level either  . 
II ence this theory is not able to deal with every type of idiom  . 

According to Pesetsky ( 1985 ) in a configuration such as figure ( 19 ) B and E may undergo a rule of idiosyncratic interpretation  , if E is the head of C . 
(19) A
B C
DE
For sentence ( 14 ) in which " heart " is the head of the NP dominating ' ~ ury ' sheart "  , the Meofid to syncratie Interpretation is allowed  , resulting in : (20) S
NP VP

VNP break ~ ~ iNpN ; ~ heart:Mary's "'

In the above tree , the effect of the rule of idiosyncratic interpretation is indicated by the dotted lines  ; the effect is that the idiom parts are mapped onto one meaning  . 
As snggested by Pesetsky , this would also account for sentence ( 13 ) if we follow F ~ yne ( 1982 ) in his analysis of double object constructions . Kayne claims that " NP the finger " forms a constituent with " the finger " as its head  , so the rule of idiosyncratic interpretation is allowed  . 
Sentences ( 17 ) and ( 2122 ) are problematic even under this analysis : ( 21 ) Peterammed his lack of money down Mary's throat ( 22 ) Pete gave Mary credit for her work Figure ( 23 ) gives a representation of sentence ( 21 ) in which " his lack of money " and " Mary " are free arguments :  ( 23 ) S
Pete his lack of money PNP down ~
NPN throat

Since " throat " and " down " are heads of their constituents  , one might suggest a successive application of the rule of idiosyncratic interpretation  , but it is not clear how such a rule should operate and since every constituent has a head and syntactic categories are no barrier to rule application  , the domain in which this rule is permitted is unlimited  . 
It seems that Chomsky ( 1981 ) and Pesetsky ( 1985 ) are not capable of dealing with the counter examples given here  . 
The treatment of idioms presented in this paper can cope with these phenomena because it is based on the asst~np tion that elements of idioms neither have to be adjacent at the level of interpretation nor do they have to be in the In the field of compntational linguistics not much attention has been paid to idioms  . Some examples are Rothkel ( 1973 ) and Wehrli ( 1984 )  . However , in their proposals idioms are treated in the lexicon or morphology and there is no apparent way to account for the scattering of elements of idioms in sentences  . 
The organisation of the rest of the paper is as follows : in section  ( 2 ) an outline of the theoretical framework of t ~ Ro sett a machine translation system will be given  ; section ( 3 ) discusses idioms within this frmue work ; section ( 4 ) discusses some of the typical problems mentioned in the introduction  . 
2 Outline of Isomorphic M-Grammars
The Roset tasy stem is based on the " isomorphic grammar " approach to machine translation  . In this approach a sentence s " is considered a possible translation of a sentence sifs and s " have not only the same meaning but if they also have similar derivational histories  , which implies that their meanings are derived in the same way from the same basic meanings  . This approach requires that " isomorphic grammars " are written for the languages under consideration  . 
The term " possible translation " should be interpreted as " possible in a particular context  "  . The discussion in this paper will be restricted to the translation of isolated sentences on the basis of linguistic knowledge only  . 
In the following sections the notions M-gremmars , the variant of Montague grammar used in the Roset ta system  , and isomorphic grammars will be introduced . For a more detailed discussion of isomorphic M -grammars the reader is referred to L and shergen  ( 1982 ,  1984) . In section (2 . 3) an example of an M-grammar will be given . 
2.1 M-Gray , mrs
The grammars used in the system , called M-grammars , can be seen as a computationally viable variant of Montague Grammar which is in accordance with the transformational extensions proposed by Partee  ( 1973 )  . This implies that the syntactic rules operate on syntactic trees rather than on strings  . Restrictions have been imposed on the grammars in such a way that effective parsing procedures are possible  . 
An M-grammar consists of ( i ) a syntactic ,   ( ii ) a morphol-ogical and ( iii ) a semantic component . 
( i ) The syntactic component of an M-grammar defines a set of " S-trees "  . 
An " S-tree " is a labelled ordered tree . The labels of the nodes consist of a syntactic category and a list of attribute-value pairs  . The branches are labelled with the names of syntactic relations  , such as subject , head , object , etc . 
An M-grammar defi~es a set of S-trees by specifying a set of basic S-trees and a set of syntactic rules called " M-Rules "  . 
An " M-Rule " defines a partial function from tuples of 
S-trees to S-trees.
Starting from basic expressions , an expression can be formed by applying syntactic rules  . The result of this is a surface tree , in which the labels of the terminal nodes correspond to words  . This process of making an expression is represented in an M-grammar by a " syntactic derivation tree '  , in which the basic expressions are labels of the terminal nodes and the names of the rules that are applicable are labels of the nonterminal nodes  . In the example below ( Fig .  (25)) , rule RI makes the NP " the cat " from the ' basic expression " cat " and rule R  2 makes the S-tree for the sentence ( 24 ) on the basis of the NP and the basic expression " walk "  ( the constructions to the left of the dotted llrms are abbreviations of ~ lat the result of the application of the rule looks like  )  .

J the cat cat ( ii ) The morp m logical component relates terminal S -trees to strings ? This conu~nent will be ignor ~ l in the rest of the discussion  . 
In this way the syntactic and then ~ r phological component define sentences  . 
( iii ) The sem~mticc ~ nponent . M-grammars obey the compositionality principle , i . e . every syntactic rule and every basic S-treegets a model-theoretical interpretation  . For translation purposes only the names of meanings and the names of meaning rules are relevant as ~ il \] be shown later  . 
The model-theoretical interpretation of the basic S-trees and the synt~ticm * les is represented in a " s ~ lantic derivation tree "  , which has the same ~ eo~l~try as the syntactic derivation tree  , hut is labelled with naales of meanings of r~es and basic expressions  . An example is given below in (27) . 
Before giving an example of an M-gramnmr in section  ( 2 . 3), isomorphic M-grm~mars will be discussed . 
2.2 Isomorphic M-Grammars
To establish the possible translation relation the gramnars must be attuned to each other as follows :- For each basic express : i on of a gr ~ ma arG of a language L there is at least one basic expression of a grammar G " of a language L " with the same meaning  . 
-For each syntactic rule of G there is at least one syntactic rile of G~corresponding to the sane meaning operation  . Syntactically these roles nmy differ considerably . 
Two sentences are defined to be ( possible ) translations of each other if they have derivation trees with the sm~egeometry  , in which the corresponding nodes are labelled with names of corresponding rt ~ es and basic expressions  . If this is the case then the derivation trees are isomorphic and the two sentences have the same semantic derivation tree  . 
Grammars that correspond to each other in the way described above will be called " isomorphic grammars " if the corresponding rules satisfy certain conditions on application  , such that for each well-fonned syntactic derivation tree in one language there is at least one corresponding wellformed syntactic derivation tree in the other language  . A syntactic derivation tree is wellformed if it defines a sentence  , ioe ~ if the rules are applicable . 
The following is an illustration of these principles = X ~ eleft part of figure  ( 27 ) shows the derivation tree of sentence ( 26 ) which is the Dutchtrm~slation of sentence ( 24 )  . Rule R~h ~ ilds the NP " dekat " from the basic expression " kat ' and rule R "  2 constructs the expression " dekatloopt " from the NP and the basic expression " lopen "  . 
There is a correspondence between both the basic expressions and the syntactic rules of the two granmars  . Each rule of the syntactic derivation tree is mapped onto a corresponding rule of the s~antic derivation tree and each basic expression is mapped onto the corresponding basic meaning  .

The semantic derivation trees are used as the interlingua  . The analysis cc~ponent translates sentences into semantic derivation trees  ; the generation component translates semantic derivation trees into target lang~mge sentences  . In this paper the translation relation will ~ discussed generatively only  . 
2.3 All Example of an M-Gr~mmmar
In this section an example will be given of an M -grammar that generates sentence  ( 28 ) i ( 28 ) Petelends the glrlabook Only those M-Rules that are relevant to the discussion in the following sections will be dealt with  . Note that the rules given here are in an info ~xaal notation  . 
The M-gran~narneeded for this exanple : ( i ) basic S-trees :
VERB ( lend )   ( in this infomnal notation the syntactic information in the basic S-trees  , given in the focal of attribute-value pairs , has been omitted )



VAR(xl ), VAR(x ~), ...
(VAR '? are s~itactic variables corresponding to logical variables  )   ( ii ) M-Rules:
Some notation a\] conventions :- tl , t , etc . are S-trees , mu's~ndicate arbitrary strings of relation/S -tree pairs  , -square brackets indicate nesting , -in an expression of the fonndet/ART ( the ) det is the relation , ART the category and " the " a literal . 
So an expression like CL\[subJ/NP , head/VERB , n ~ l \] stands for:
CLj /"
NP VERB
RI : if tI is of category VERB and t 2 is of category VAR with index i and t 3 is of category VAR with index j and then : CL\ [ subj/t  , head/t , iobj / t , obj/t\] 2 i " 3   4 The rule operates on a ditransitive verb and three vari ~ ables at ~ d makes a clause in which the variables are the subject  , indirect object and direct object respectively . 
R 2 : if t\]is of category NOUN then : " NP\[head / ti\] 
R3 if tI is of category NOUN then:NP\[det/ART ( the )  , head/tl\]
R 4 : if t\]is of category NOUN then:NP\[det/ART ( a )  , head/tl\]
R 5 i : if tI is of category NP and ~' t ~ is of the form CL\[subj/VAR  ( xi )   , mul\]then:zCL\[subj/tl , mul\]This is a rule scheme with an instance for every variable index i  . The rule substitutes an NP for the subject variable  . The same holds for rules R~~ and R ~ , in which the NP's are substituted for the ind if @ . d t and d i ~ c t object respectively . 
R6 , j : if tI is of category NP and t 2 is of the form CL\[mul , iobj/VAR(xj ) , mu2\] then:CL\[mul , iobj/tI , mu2\]~ , k : if tI is of category NP and t 2 is of the fon1~ CL\[mul , obj/VAR(x ,  . )\] then ~" CL\[mul , obj/t ~\] if tI has the form ~ l , \[s\[tbj/NP , l lead/vERB , mull R 8: then : SENTENCE\[subj/NP , head/VERB , mu\] . \] Apart from changing the category , this rule assigns the tense to the verb and specifies the form in accordance with the number and person of the subject  , which is not indicated here ( the correct for misspelled out in the morphological component  )  . 
In this example the rules operate as follows : - Rule RI applied to " lend "  , VAR(xi ) , VAR(xj ) and VAR(Xk ) as indicated , -rule Rp applied to "' Pete " gives NP ( Pete ) , - R3 applied to " girl " renders NP ( the girl ) , -R4 applied to "' book " NP ( a book ) , -rule R5 applied to " lend " and NP ( Pete ) renders CL ( Petel end x . x ~' ~ ,
K . , - appl ~ cation of R ~ . to lend " and NP ( the girl ) renders
CL ( Petelend the gi~IJx ~) , ~- application of ~ k fro " lend " and NP ( a book ) resLtlts in i
CL ( Petelend the gir ~ a book ) , -application of R8 gives ? E hTI~NCE ( Petelends the girla book )  .

Peteenoxix jxk 3 Idioms and Isomorphic M-Grammmrs Traditionally  , in Montague semantics , as for instance in the PTQ paper ( Moutague ,  1973) , a basic expression has a primitive meaning . However , the semantic concept basic expression does not always coincide with what one would call a syntactic primitive  . This is the case , for instance , with idioms . For exmnple the idiom " kick the bucket " has the primitive meaning " die '  , but the syntactic primitives are " kick " , "the " and " bucket " . 

For reasons given in the introduction it is impossible to treat idioms as strings  ( i . e . syntactic primitives ) ? The possibility of applying syntactic transformations to  ( el-oments of ) idioms , which are also applicable to non-idio-matic constructs  , suggests that idi~l~s should be treated as having complex constituent structures  , which are similar to non-ldiomatic constituent structures  . The possibility of having free arguments , which are realized by various grammatical functions  , suggests that parts of idioms do not have to be adjacent at any level of the syntactic process  . 
The complex idiomatic constituent structure should accommodate this  . 
In Rosetta , before idioms were introduced , basic expressions were terminal S-trees , i . e . tenminal nodes . 
Idioms can be treated as basic S-trees that have an internal structure  . This type of expression is an example of what will be called a " comp\]ex basic expression "  ( CBE )  . 
ACBE is a basic expression from a semantic point of view  , i . e . it correspands to a basic meaning , and a complex expression from a syntactic point of view  , i . e . it is a nonterminal S-tree . For exmnple , the basic S~treefor " kick the bucket " looks like the following :  ( 30 ) VERB
VAN VERB
V 1 " kick " det/~head/x
ARTNOUN " the " " bucket "
By extending the notion of basic expression in this way the attuning of grammars  ( as defined in section ( 2 . 2 ) ) is easJer to achieve : corresponding basic expressions may be CBE's  . For ex~nple the D~itch verb " dood gaan " may correspond to the English idiom " kick the bucket  "  . Special measures are necessary to guarantee that the rules obey the conditions on application  ( cf . section (2 . 2)) . 
Basic expressions are listed in the basic lexicon of a grammar  . ACBE is represented as a canonical surface tree structure in the lexicon  . A canonical surface tree structure is the default tree structure for a certain sentence  , phrase , etc . , i . e . the structure to which no syntactic transformations have applied  . For example : if there is a passive transformation  , the canonical structure is in the active form . Figure ( 32 ) shows the lexicon representation of the idiom : ( 31 ) xIlendx 2ah and ( 32 ) VERB subJ- . \] ~ ea ~ iob ~ jbj ~ jobj

ARTNOUN " a " " hand "
The VAR nodes are not specified ( i . e . not referring to an actual VAR ) in the dictionary . These variables will be replaced by syntactic variables  , when the CBE is inserted into the syntactic tree , Apart from the category VERB and the usual attribute-value pairs ~ the top node contains a set of attribute-value pairs that indicates which trans=formations are possible  . 
3 . 1 Treatment of Complex Basic Expressions In this section an extension of the M-grammar of section  ( 2 . 3 ) will be given that can deal with an interesting class of Complex Basic Expressions and t ~ oM -grarmnars will be related to each other according to the isomorphy approach  . 
Some other reasons for having complex basic expressions will be given  . 
3.1.1 An Example of an M-grmmmar for Complex Basic
Expressions
In this section an M-graml~mr will be presented that generates the idiomatic sentence :  ( 33 ) Petelends the girlab and The grmmnar of section  ( 2 . 3 ) is extended in tile following way: ( i ) basic S-trees

Lobj/t3\]This rule expects a complex , transitive verb and two variables ; it constructs a clause in which tile variables are the subject and the indirect object  . 
For this example the rules operate as follows : - R  9 renders CL ( xilendx . a h and ),
R2 and R3 as in section 3 (2.3),
R5 irenders CL ( Petelendx . ahand),
R6' . gives CL ( Petelend the Jgirlah and ) , ru ~ R8 results in CL ( Petelends the girlah and )  .

One of the basic expres Jions differs . So the structures can he idiomatic or non -idiomatic and other rules of tlleM-granmmr  ( e . g . wh ~ novement or passiw\[sation ) are applicable to both these structures , unless , as Intile case of certain idioms , they are prohibited as indicated at the top node . 
3 . 1 . 2 Complex Basic Expressions and Isomorphic Grammar ~ Assume we have an M-grammar that generates the Dutch sentence  ( 35 ) wld ch is a translation of ( 33 )  . It is then possible to let the English M-grammar given above for  ( 33 ) correspond to this grmnmar in the following way :   ( 35 ) Pete help the tmeisje ( 36 ) RM6"
RMR "
R~"3/~.~73M 473/'k "
Pete Vla . . V2 B1 B2 Pete help
Here " Pete " in both languages corresponds to the basic meaning B  , " VlendV2ah and " and " help " to B , rules R91\] . 2 and R " correspond to meaning rule MI , R2 and R"2 to M2 , R5 and R ' ~ to M4 , etc . .
In this ~ ray it is possible to establish a correspondence between complex basic expressions in one language and basic expressions that are not complex in another  . In a similar fashion it is possible to establish a relation between complex basic expressions in one language and cc~nplex basic expressions in another  . Note that in this way it is not necessary to incorporate a so-e & lled structural transfer in the machine translation syst ~ n for the translation of 
CBE " s.
3 . 2 Other Reasons for Waving Complex Basic Expressions Expressions that : are not idiomatic  , but that consist of more than one word can be handled by means of a c~nplex basic expression in order to retain the isomorphy  . This is the case if the expression ( i ) corresponds to an idiom or ( ii ) corresponds to a word in another lmlguage . Examples are tllefollo ~ clng: ( i ) Inl ) utch ( 37 ) is not an idiom it * the sense defined above ( i . e . the meaning of the expression " kwaad worden " can be composed in a natural way from " kwaad " and " wor-den "  )  , but has an idiomatic equivalent in English (38) . 
(37) kwaad worden(Eng . " become angry " )   ( 38 ) lose one's temperIf " kwaad worden " has to correspond to " lose one's temper "  , then in a technical sense , in Dutch , "kwaadworden " can be treated in the s~neway as an idiom  . 
( ii ) The Italian word ( 39 ) which translates into F . nglish ( 40 ) and Spanish ( 41 ) whieh translates into English ( 42 ) are words that correspond to complex expressions in English  ( and Dutch )  . From a translational point of view cases like " getupearly " can be treated in the same way as idioms  . 
(39 ) adagiare ( 40 ) lay down with care ( 4\] ) madrugar ( 42 ) getupearly 4 Some Typical Problems In this sections onle of the problems mentioned in the introduction will he briefly discussed  . 
4 . 1 Argument Var iables Embedded in a Complex Bas:\ [c 

In sentence ( 43 ) there are two arguments " Pete " arid " Mary " and the idiom " x  . break x_'sheart " . The subject ( " Pete " ) \[ z is treated in the same way as in the previous examples  . The argument substitution 1"ele substitutes the variable by the NP " Pete " , giving the structure in (44) , in which , event-tmlly , the NP " Mary " substitutes for the argument variable xI  . Special M-Rules will have to be added to an M -granmar to achieve this kind of substitution  . " Normal " argument canonical positions , i . e . as a subject or ( indirect ) object directly under the clause node or as an object to a preposition in a prepositional object  . 
(43) Pete broke Mary's heart (44) CL
NP VERB NP hJad " break " det/\head
I/\
NOUN VAR NOUN " Pete " xI " heart "
The argument substitution rule for this type of construct looks like the following : 
Rlo , h : if tI is of category NP and t 2 is of the form CL\[n~al , 
NP\[det/VAR(~) , mu2\] , mu3\] then:CL\[mul , NP\[de~/tl , mu2\] , mu3\]In this rule tl is assigned genitive case . 
Rule R . 0 happlied to NP(Ymry ) results in CL ( Petebreak
Mary's ~ e ' art).
In this way it is also possible to deal with the constructs mentioned in the introduction  , as for example " x \] ramx 2 down x3"s throat " ~ 4  . 2 Variables Boundhy Arguments Sentence ( 45 ) contains a possessive pronoun " his " , that refers to the subject " the boy " . In the lexicon the basic expression is represented as in  ( 46 )  . 
(45) the boylos this te~nper (46) VERB

VAR VERB NP
V1"lose "/ N dethead/\
POS SPRONOUN
VI"t~nper "
The M-Rule that inserts the CBE makes all possible forms of the possessive pronoun  ( his , her , their , etc . ) . The substitution rule for the subject decides upon the form of the possessive pronoun  . 
In ( 47 ) the possessive pronoun " her " is bound to the object " the woman "  . The treatment here is similar to the one above . The argument to which the pronoun has to be bound is indicated in the lexicon  . 
(47 ) the man gave the woman her freedom 5 Conclusion The method described in this paper for the treatment of idioms can deal with the problems traditionally related to expressions of this type  . Structural transfer is not necessary , since idioms are mapped onto basic meanings . The grammar can operate on idiom structures in the same way as it operates on non-idiomatic structures  , whil@ , in the case of certain idioms , restrictions on operations are specified . A test implementation in the Rosetta machine translation system has shown that this approach is promising  . 


The author would like to thank all n~mbers of the Rosettate am  , particularly Jan Landsbergen and Jan Odijk , for their helpful comments on earlier versions of this paper  . This work was supported in part by a grant from the Nederlandse Herstructureringsmaat schappij  ( NEHEM )  . 
Notes ( i ) Different native speakers of a language may vary in their judgements about the possible transformations an idiom may undergo  . 1 hough this Doses a problem , it will be ignored for the present . 
(2 ) This paper deals only with idioms with a verb as head  . 
Idioms of the type " spic and spaN ' and " at any rate " are " fixed '  , i . e . they cannot undergo any syntactic transformations  . They are therefore less interesting from a theoretical point of view  . In Rosetta fixed idioms will be treated as one word in the morphological component  . 
(3 ) Basic S-trees are similar to the Montaguegral mmr concept of basic expressions  . The term basic expression will be used frequently to indicate both ~
