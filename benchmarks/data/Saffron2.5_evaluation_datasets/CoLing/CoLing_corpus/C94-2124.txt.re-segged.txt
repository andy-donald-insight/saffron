1 Introduction
Degree words in naturall ; mguage , which are exempll-lied by the tbllowing , exist across p~rts of speech and across specific languages  . 
(:) a . qua . ntifiers : b . adw . ' rbs : e . adjectiw ! s : ~/ liIlllally ) SOllle It'e ~ , v ) llO always , of tell ~ SOl Iletil \ [ les ~ seldom , nevert all , short Degree words haw ,  . S ( ) ll le inte resting characteristics . 
First , quantities in the real workl which can be repre sented by degree words w ~  . rypragmatically , depending on speakers , situa . tions , etc . ( Fauconnier , 1 . 975) . This means that degree words do not have denotations in there a  , 1 world . I Iowever , lllalty degreL'expressions are used in daily life and it  ; is not t blt thai , they are par-ticula . rly incomprehensil ~ le . The authors do not think thaC to underst~md the lnean htgs of degree words is to understan  ( \[tit (  ; rea . l quantities in the real world . 
Second ~ it is difficult to compare : degree words in different languages  , in the case of the English non-degree word ~ dog , ~ we may think that the word semantically corresponds to the  ; lapanese word ' iml ' because these two words reli ! r to ~ he same object ' clog ' in the real world  . However , this correspondence is not true of degree words . Tim English wo M % ften ' intuitively corresponds to Lit  ( ' . Japanese word % hitmshib % ~ but this correspondence is not ol  ) vious . 'Fhat is because these words do not have . denota . tions in the real world . 
The sechttra . cteristics a , rerelated to the b~vse of Machine Tr~tnslation and its dietionaries  . Even when the real quantity , which is reti?rred to by ~ t degree word in ~ t ext  , is not clearly understood , it is usually believed that it is possible to translate the word into ~ tnother language  . When building bilingual dictiom tries , it is necessary to consider the correspondence b tween  ( lm gree words in each htnguage . A new reference framework is needed by which to investigate to what extent the two words correspond to each other  . These issues are . also related to conceptual descriptions in btrge scale knowledgel  ) aae projects , wl fieh have started recently . 
Third , degree word stuwe some ch ~ racteristics which are in depel Ment from in ~ rts of speech  . One of the phenomena degree words have in comnlon is modification restrictions between degree words and r legree intensi  . -tiers . Each degree word ha . sits own modification restriction ( Bolinger , 1972; Quirk , 1985; Kamei ,  1988 ,  1990) . For example , % IP and qm~can be modified by ' Minos ( , ' but'tall , '' short , ' hn any ~' and ' few'cannot usually be so h ~ mdled  . On the other hand , % all , '% hort , ' many , ' and ' ihw'rail be modified by ~ ve . ry,'but'a,nd % 0' cannot . ' Some ' trod'sometimes ' cannot be modified by either % ery ' or ~ ahnost  . ' Previous researchers pointed out a lot of important linguistic phen on mna ~ which ~ re related to degree words but  , the issues described a bow ~ . were left uninw ~ stigated . 
Barwisetrod Cooper ( 1981 ) investigate relations I ) c ~ taween determiners in English and ge , mrMized quantl-tiers in logic . Howew . ' r , they did not focus so much on degree words , such~s ~ tdjeetiw ' . s and adverbs in general . it is still undetermined how to fully comprehend such words as ' ma  . ny ' and % i'ew . ' Oazdar ( 1979 ) and I Iirsehberg ( 1985 ) introduced ideas of a linear ordering of degree words and treated ~ wide range of phenom-elut related to degree words  . However , they directly htm rlled real words and treated ~ positive words ~ such as  %11' and hn any , ' ~ ndqmgative words ~ such as flew ' and % o ~ separ ~ ttely  . Relations between the positive and negative words were not clear  . In order to con , prehend these , unsolw M linguistic phenomena ~ the authors propose a semantic model of degree  , concepts . 
7 75   2 Discrete Degree Primitives and a List Expression This section introduces discrete degree priinitives and a list expression ' co represent mea  . nings of degree concepts . From the perspective of quantities in the real world  , hn any ' and ' some ' are sfmilar . However , The modification restriction be . tween degree words and degree intensifier shows that e~mh word is normally modified by intensifier selectively  . This suggests the existence of DISCILETE degree concept primitives  , which are independent from parts of speech . The authors introduce five basic semantic primitives  ( ~ A , ' ~ M , ' ~ S , '' F , ' and ' N' ) indicating degree that are abstracted from the meanings of %  . 11, ' hnany , ' ~ fcw , ' and ; no . ' A list of degree primitives is used to describe meanings of degree words in terms of relative positions in the list expression  . 
A , M , S , l >, N
The list expression above is a basic list of the discrete model  . The , ut thors divide meanings of degree words inte two parl  ; s . For example , ' tall ' and % hort ' can be divided into the semantic axis regarding ' tallness ' and the degree concepts ' many  ( much ) ' ~ md'few ( little )  . ' Tables 2 and 3 represent the htter part of meanings of degree words  . In these lists , '-' means that the value in that pa . rtict,la . r position is lacking .

Basic list M , S , Ftall M ,  -- , -not tall and not short- , S , -short- ,  -  , F The authors think that degree words are identified by their relative positions in the list expression  . It is true that quantities in the real world , which are expressed by degree words , are continuous , tIow (' . ver , the authors think that language treats degree concepts in a discrete way  . T ~ d ) le 3 shows modificatiou restrictions on degree intensifiers using the primitives  . In this table , %' shows that the intensifiers canlnodify the ( le-gree primitives , and '-' shows the intensifiers cannot modify the prinfitives  . Note that these primitives are not realwords and that they consistently describe relationships that are independent from parts of speech  . 
These are important differences between this model and previous research reports  .

Degree Primitives
AMSPN -+-+--+-+--+-+-++++ 3 A Dual List Expression of Degree Concept It is pointed out that degree words convey nonliteral ' conversational ' meanings when they are used  . The digference between a liter at i meaning and a converst ~ tional meaning is called ' Couversation M Imf  ) licature ' ( Grice ,  1967) . This section explains how this model treats this aspect of degree concepts  . 
3 . 1 Question and Answer ( 17 o exemplify Conversational Implicature , let us consider the following sentence , which includes a number . 
(3) I solved three of the problems.
A natural interpretation of this sentence is " I solved just three of the prol  ) lems , not allor four or two or one or none of them . "Kowever , in a logical way , this statement is true , when " I solved FOUR of them . " For example , if the borderline between success and failure of a test is three  , this sentence is naturally spoken , even when , in fact , the person solved four of the i ) roblems ( Chomsky , 1972; Ota , 1980; Ikeuehi ,  1985) . The following is a Yes/No question corresponding to sentence  ( 3 ) and its answers . Interestingly , both of the answers below are possible in this case  . 
(4) A : Did you solve three of the problems ?
B :- Yes , in fact is olved four.
-No , I solved four.
In order to handle these phenomena , more complex states than just ' three ' for the meaning of the nu  , nber thre . e are needed . The authors think that five states are a . ctually needed fbr clarity: ( 1 ) All problems are solved .   ( 2 ) The mml ber of solw xl problems exceeds the number which a I  ) pears in the sentence ( = three in this case )  .   ( 3 ) The number of solved problems is exactly the number which appears  . (4) The number of pears . (5) Nol ) roblenls are solved . The authors introduce the five primitives , ' A , ''> n\]~:1h''In , ' and ' N , ' corresponding t /) these five states , respec . tively . A list expression is introduced as follow . ' < A , > : 1, < u , N ' l ' he livesta . t , es are represent , e . d with rela , tivel > O ~ d ? tiens shown in Talfle 4 .

It is necessary to change the meaning of the values from the number of tim solved problems to the number of unsolved problen : s in the representation of the original Mfirma-tiw ~ sentence  ( Fig .  2) . The lower row expresses the possibility that the number of the unsolved problems exceeds thl  . et: .

Where the musher ( = three in this case ) is within the scope of negation , the negative sentence requires other interpretations  .

.--- Interpretation ( B ) 1 Lesponse B might mean that some of the 1 ) roblems were solved , but that them unber did : to treach three . 
This interpretation can be obtained from tile model shown in Fig  . 3, and the negation operation is shown in Table 5 .

Tabh ~ 5: Negation Operation tbr Interpretation BStep 1 in Table 5 rea . lizes a primitive negation oper-s , tion on each row . This i , ~ter pretation f the negative sentence is consistent with the negations of both the direct meaning and the possible implic ~ tion  . Step 2 realizes this condition . This interpretation usually implies that there are some solved problems  . This means the negation usually does not deny the  . existence of tiles ol w ~ d prol ) lems , t to wever , in a logical way , no problem being solved is a possible situation . Step 3 realizes this condition . 
(9) A : l ) id you solve three of tke problems ?
C:No , I didn't solve THREE of the probh ; ms : I solved ALL of them . 
-Interpretation ( C )
The above is a possible utterance , which requires ~ nother interpretation . Table 6 shows the way to calculate this interpretation ( I : ~ terl ) retation ( C ) ) . 
1 . Revers each affirmative row , 2 . Select the DIFFERENT part of the two rows . 
The result is a new possible interpretatiou row.
3. Omit the edgew dues ( A and N).
The result is a new direct meaning row.
Table 6: Negation Operation for Interpretation CThis interpretation differs from interpretation B  , only at Step 2 , that is , ' to select the DIFFERENT p~rt of the two rows . ' This means that the interpretation is consistent with only the negation of tile direct meaning  , and does not satisfy the negation of the pos -sibh  . " implication . Step 2 realizes this condition . This exemplifies that the Conversational Implicature can be canceled  . In speech ~ stress is put on THREE and ALL in this interpret  , ~ tion , and this linguistic phenomenon is accounted for in Step  2  . 
4 Negat ion of Degree Expressions in Natura l Language In this section ~ the dual list representation ad the operations introduced in the previousection are applied to degree words other than numbers  . 
4.1' All , ' ~ no , ' ~ some , ' and ~ not all '
Here , we will apply the same model to the relations between ' all/~some ~'' no  , ' and blot all ' in naturalan-guage . Sentence (101) logically entails sentence (102) . Sentence (102) usually implies senteuce (103) . 
I to we ver , sentence ( 103 ) contradicts the original sell-fence ( 10~1 )  . A careless mixture of logical implication and usm dimplication in language makes the inference of  ( 103 ) from ( 101 ) unreasonable ( t-Iorn , 1972; Ota , 1980; McCawley 1981) . 
(101) All students are intelligeut.
(102) Some students are intelligent.
(103) Some students are NOT intelligent.
The discrete model is ~ use thl tool for describing these relations  . List ( 11 ) is used to express relations 1 ) etween ' all , '' some , '' no , ' ~ tnd ' not all (= some . . . 
not ) . ' In this case , only three primitives are used .

In this list , the w~lue ~ S ' corresponds to the state where in there are SOME students who are intelligent and SOME other students who are NOT intelligent  . 
Theme , ~ nings of these words are also expressed with a dual list  . Figure 7 graphically represents this .

This paper introduced eight basic degree primitives for degree concept  , that is , ' A , '' M , '' S , '' F , '' N , ' '> n , '' = n , ' and ' < n . ' t to we ver , the authors do not claim that these eight primitives are sufficient o indicate all degree concepts  . Instead ~ the authors clMm that people comprehend degree concepts in a discrete way  , and that degree concepts are identified by their rela-tlw ~ positions in the fl'amework of understanding  . Consider the following cxan~ples concerning , ~nother degree concept'several , ' which differs from these eight degree concepts .

Quantities , which are refl . ' rredtoby'sew ' . ral ' and ' a few , ' seem to be close . It is often said that quantities ret > rred to by ' several ' include fiw  .

Previous researchers have not been successflfl in describing the diflhrence between's even d ' and ' a few  . ' The authors think that'sew .

'' Several ' implies ' not one , ' while ' ~ few'implies ' not many . ' An important point is that the ditference between ' several ' and ~ a few ' is not the exact quantity involved  , but a framework of understanding , that is , the set of vahms in the lists and their relative positions  . 
4.3 ' OR ' in Natural Language and
Negation
It has been shown that the logical operator ~ OR ' has characteristics similar to degree concepts  ( Gazdar ,  1979) . This is because ' of in natural anguage generally has two interpretations  , the ' inclusive or ' and the ' exclusiw ' . or . ' This section applies the same model for degree concepts to a logical operator ' OIL ' and ' or ' in natural anguage  . 
It is difficult to conceptualize then e . gation of ' or ' in natural anguage , in a usual sense , although negation of ' and ' is easy . Logically , however , the negation of the logical operation ' OR ' ( that is , ' Inclusive or ') is ' NOR . ' However , in a sense in natured language , ' AND ' instead of ' NOR ' can also be a negation of ' Oil  . .' and or nor  (+ +) ,  (+-4 -+)  ,  ( - -)  ( ( - -  ,  (+- / +)  , : Exc . OR ++), (+-/-+), Inc . OR (++),-,(--),,(---)

Fig . 9: Negations of ' OP , '
Figure 9 shows the relationship between tile inclusive and exclusive ' or ' and their negations  . The authors use three states : ( , -+) ,  (+- / -+)  , and (--) . ' Exclusive or ' is a direct meaniug of ' or ' ~ tnd'inclusive or ' is a possible interpret ~ tion f ' or ' in this framework  . The same negation operations will produce the two neg > mea  , ningrows in the two interl ) ret ; ~ tlons of nega . tions of ' or ' ha . veno values . This corresponds to the Mettha . t i t . is difficult to consider the nega . tion of % r ' in mttura , l language . No ~( ; that the dual list fbr ' or ' and the du ; dlist . for ' somo ' in Fig . 4 ha . veani do . ntical structure . It is equally explained that the nega . tion of ' some ' is difli-ct tlt to consider in na . tural language . , while the neg ~ tion of %11' is easy .
