Semantically Governed Machine Translation of BE-clauses with Ad- 
verbs and Prepositional Phrases.
Demonstration of a Ring-Model for German ~ Eng lish  , English/German
including Analysis-Synthesis , Transformation , Transition , and
Generation.
Klaus G ~ nther Schweisthal , Forschungsgruppe LIMAS , Bonn Research in methods of lexicalization , classification , analysis-synthesis , transformation , transition , and generation , which has been carried on independently in the German and English sections at LIMAS  , has recently been consolidated for the purpose of con-structing a Ring-Translation-Mode l for German/English  , English /

This model has to meet the following requi rements : I  . It must ; produce a translation which is identical in meaning to the original and stylisti cally acceptable  . 
2 . Some Of the difficulties which have here to fore appeared in machine translation must be resolved  . 
The starting point ( Figure I ) is a German adverbial phrase , which is to be analyzed and then converted in to a factor formula by means of a morpho-nomo -transformation  . An explicative homo-homo-transformation together with preposition algoverning fac tors then expand the factor formula for the adverbial expression into a formula for a p repositional phrase  , which in turn becomes expressible through a no mo-morpho-transformation  . The factor formula for the German preposit ional phrase is converted into an English factor formula according to the coordinator ' s system of maximum agreement  . This takes place through a nomo-nomo-transi tion if the identical factor formula is p resent in English  , otherwise through a nomo-~omme ~ ra~afQ ~ mation . Anomo-morpho-tr & nsformation then creates an expressible English prepositional phrase which is se-mantically equivalent to the German  . The factor formula for an English adverbia l phrase is made possible by a reductive nomo -homo-transformation plus a nomo-morpho-t ransformation  . The last step of the cycle again takes p lace in the coordinator  . The factor formula for the English adverbia l phrase is converted into the corresponding formula for the German adverbial phrase by means of transition or a homo-homo-trans formation  . The morphological realization of this factor formula is identical to that of the initial German adverbial phrase  . 
A sample output of the ring would be : vater is tdrinnen  .   .   .   . Vateristinner halb des Hauses .   .   .   . 
Father is inside ( of ) the house .   .   .   . Father is inside .   .   .   . 
Vaterist drinnen.
The automatic reversible process of the ring model is determined by several association l is ts and function matrices  . At first a-I-i ~ ~ .   . I ; ~3 .   .   .   .

Dlexicon of German J and English semantic factors is necessary  . 
This list forms the upper row for the necessary no mo ' association lists of the German-English words  ( Figure 2 )  . In this figure are illustrated threed if ferent types of semantic association  . 
List A/D illustrates the association of the factors to the German adverbs  , A/P to the German prepositions , and N/D to the various German noun classes . In a strict sense the noun class associat ion is to be specified once again according to the two syntactic functions of the noun in the sentence  , i . e . BE-subject * and BE-complement * . 
~ For English the association has been organ ized in a similar manner in the lists A/S  , P/E , N/S , but in such a way that they are independent of German  . 
An example may make this a little more c lear  . Assume that A/ D1 is the German adverb " drinnen " and the fac tors I  ,  3 ,  5 ,  8 , are coded symbols for the factors 0 r___~t , La~e , Einschlu ~ , Bet ~ hung derein schlie ~ enden Grenzen , Hinweis , then according to the ' ~ prin-Qiple of maximum agreement we are able to determine the same fac -tor combination Place  , Location , Interior , Accent on boundaries , Reference , in A/E under 1 , which in English is the word " inside ,   . 
With this same set of factors we find that in the lists P/D a ~ d P/E according to max imum agreement the results are P/DI and  P/E1  , which are expressed as " inner halb " and " in s ide of "  . 
In the list N/D all five preposition factors appear in the noun class B  , so that if we were to choose as BE-complements the words Garten or Haus the resultant phrase would be : inner halb desGar-ten--~Hauses- -~  . Because this set of factors also appears under Bin N/E  , it is possible through transition to produce the English phrase " inside of the garden  ( house ) "  . 
In view of this schematic arrangement one might think that it is possible to associa teall@erman prepositions word for word w ?th English prepositions  .   ( This method was used frequently in the early days of machine translation resulting in untold difficul'ties  .   ) Such word for word association is almost 100 % possible for the prepositions of place . 
But if , for example , we are dealing with the German word nach , which can either be P/D ~ plus factor 7 ( Zeit ) or P/Dh plus fac-tor 2 ( 0 rt )   , we are not-able to make a direct associat ion  , but ~ must decide according to the method of maximum agreement whether English  , after " or " to " is meant . 
The corresponding words in A/D and A/E wou ldbe"danach "-" dort-hin "  , and W after that "-" there " .

The selection of the fadtors Place and Time for the respective noun classes in the noun c lass lists N/D and N/E would allow the generation of the phrases : " nach demMit tages sen "  ,   , uach K5 ln " , and " afterlunch " , " to Cologne " . 
Already it is evident how our system diffe rs from those of ear-lier machine trans lation projects  . 
In the nomo-association list we have estab lished the prerequi-sites for gener at ion  , transformation and transition . In the imiddle function matrix P/D-P/ E  ( Figure 3 ) of this diagram are contained the restric tions as to which prepositions may combine w ith which semantic noun classes to produce a meaningful Be-com-plement  . A quick glance shows that the preposition - noun relakion-ship is differentiated in various ways  . This is one proof for the necessity of c lassifying nouns according to function or semantic classes  . 
This can be illustrated in the following Bxample  . The codes in the preposition column are rep laced by prepositions  , and the row of noun classes by a representative of each class  . 
A-rater B-Garten C-K ~ In - - ~ Mitta ~ - Q -Gedankeessen 
I . inner halbx x2 . rechts x x x ~ . nach ( Zeit)n . vor ( Abstr . Ber .  )


Using the lexicon the permitted BE-complements can be programmed from this matrix  . 
The various possibilities for generating meaningful adverbial BE-clauses can be seen in the matrix N/D-A/D  . Here again the necessity of using noun c lasses is evident  , even though some noun classes in the matrix ( A , B , C , ) appear to be similar . 
Example : Vaterist dr in neudrau ~ enrechts but not d an ach But with Mittages seu all four adverbs are possible : drinneudrau Ben  , rechts d anach A further prerequisite for the generation of meaningful BE-clau-ses containing prepositional phrases is the coordination of the BE-subject noun class w ith the BE-complement noun class  . 
The matrix Sntr/N/D-SnE/N/D supplies the necessary information  .

For example , a BE-subject from the noun class " abstract " is com-patible only with a BE  , complement from the same class . 
Die Idee is thinter dem Ge danken but not Der Gedankeisth interdem Garten Der Gartenis thinter dem Hans but not Der Gartenisthin terdem Mittages sen No ~ until all of these factors have been formalized and all con-ditions which were illustrated in the matrices are taken into consideration it is possible to set up a final function matr ix  . 
This matrix then aids the translation process in the generation of meaningful BE-c lauses with prepositional phrases  . ( Figure 4)
For example:
A is to be replaced by Vater-(father )
BHaus-(house )
CK ~ in-(Cologne )
Mittagessen ( action )  -  ( lunch ) 9 ? vet ( place )  -  ( in front of ) then NPN/D- -9 A 9 A - -7 Vateristvet demVater -- ?

The upper row of the homo-associa-tion chart , which was seen in figure 2 , is filled with over 30 semantic factors . 
The outputs show that the ring model workss at is factorily  . 
With the aid of these matrices ( Figures I-4 )  , a semantically equivalent German/Engli sh  , English/German translation can be executed for all the cases in which the funct ion matrices in both languages are identical in structure  , e . g . ( NP N/D-NP N/E .   .   .   . ( transition ) .

I i , -oOcal(NPN/DIN'PN/E ) , the proper translation is insured by means Of au auxiliary program  . This takes place through verbalization of the semantic factors of the source language in the target lan-guage  . 
For example : The English sentence The candle is inside  ( of ) the father cannot be translated into German as it now is because there is no corresponding matrix NPN/D  . The verbalization pro-gram , however , makes possible the translation Die Kerzei stim KS rperdes Vaters eing esch lossen  . 
If a German adverb has no English counterpar t  , an auxiliary pro-gram will create a semantically equivalent prepositional phrase  , eig . dahinter .   .   .   . behind it . All German adverbs must be provi-ded with the possibility of such a transform at ion  , so that in the reverse process-in case its hou ld be necessary - the proper German adverb can be selected for the English combination pre- position + p~-o noun  .

Some Terms of Ll~hkS-Terminolo ~ r::1 . Transformation a ) Morpho-transformation : A change within the morpho-struc-ture involving formal constituents  . 
b ) Morpho-semantic-transformation : A change with in the morpho-level involving those semantic factors which are referred to as " Denkweisen  "   . These are : sentence constituent , framed , stressed , cyclopic , nominal , actional , and designative . 
c ) Zorpho-nomo , and no mo-morpho-transformation : A trans fer from the morpho-level to the homo-leve lor vice versa  . 
(This is s imi la r to a change f rom the deep s t ructure to the surface structure and vice versain Transformational- 
Generative Grammar .   ) d ) Nomo-nomo-transformation : I ) Within the same language : A change of the fac tor formula by means of exchange  , addition , or elimination of cer-tain factors . 
2 ) Between the ~ ource language and the target language : The factor formula of the source language is not acceptable in the target language  , and must therefore be reshaped . 
2. Transition
The simple transfer of a factor formula f romonem et alanguage into another  . 
3. Explication
To make explicit a semantic factor in a sentence which con-tains no morpheme to represent that factor  . The morpheme can be lacking for three reasons : a  ) ellipsis b ) non-expressed context relations c ) a combination of semantic factors which are understood but not expressed  . 
It is therefore important to differentiate between a  ) ellip-sis explication , b ) context-relation explication , and c ) fac-tor explication . These three types of explication can , however , be combined . 
4. Verbalization
The process of verbally expressing a semantic factor within the morpho~level which has been determined through expli-cation  . 
_-10-~. Reduction
The opposite of explication , i . e . a factor formula of the metalanguage is not permitted to be verbalized  . The factor is not really eliminated , but is implied within the morpho-level . 
6 . Explicat in G-transformation a ) Explicating no mo-nomo-transformation : A semantic factor which has been determined through explication changes the factor formula  . 
b ) Explicating no mo-morpho-transformation : The semantic factor becomes verbalized  .
