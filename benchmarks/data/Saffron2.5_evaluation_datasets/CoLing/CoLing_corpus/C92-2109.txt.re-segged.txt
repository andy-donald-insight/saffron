The normal method for representing anaphoric dependencies in Unification Based grammar t brmalisms i that of re-entrance  . In this paper , we address the problems that this representational device poses when such formalisms are used for translation  . We demonstrate the inadequacies of existing proposals  , and describe an approach which exploits the expressive possibilities of the equational constraint language in LFG and involves an inferential procedure combining undempecification in the statement of bilingual correspondences with the use of target language knowledge  . 
1. Introduction
The normal method for representing an a-pboric dependencies in Unification Based  ( UB ) grammar formalisms is that of re-entrance ( often indicated graphically by means of subscripts  , as in ( lb )) . The interpretation is that two or more attributes share  ( are pointers to ) a single value . In the case of (1) , the SUBJ of try is identical to that of employ . This means that changes to the value of the SUBJ of try  ( e . g . the addition of another feature ) are necessarily changes to the value of the SUBJ of employ  . 
This token identity should be distinguished from the type identity between these values  , and the value of the OBJ attribute in ( lb ) , which just happens to have the same attributes and values  . 
(la ) Linguists try to employ linguists.
This device can be thought of as the attribute -value equivalent of a bound variable of logic  , and though it is not appropriate for all kinds of anaphoric dependence  , it is ubiquitous . 
This paper proposes a novel approach to the treatment of re-entrances in translation  , which overcomes the problems of existing approaches using UB formalisms  . These prob-(lb ) " PRED'try < SUBJ , XCOMP > ' fPRED ' linguist "/

PL/\[\[PE~s3rd\]lems are considerable , but have been generally ignored in the literature  . Section 2 will review existing approaches , pointing out the problems . 
Section 3 describes the approach , which provides a straightforward treatment of cases where filler-gap dependencies are subject to different constraints in source and target languages  ( e . g . 
where one language allows , and the other for bids , Preposition Stranding ) . In exemplifying this , we will focus on the treatment of relative clauses  .  1 2 . Existing Approaches 2 . 1 . Transfer B used ( Structural ) Approaches . 
Perhaps the most obvious way to use a
LIB formalism for translation is to use a standard UB grammar formalism in analysis to produce a feature structure  ( FS )  , which is a collection of attribute-value ( A:V ) pairs . This is then mapped to a target FS by means of a bilingual grammar of transferules whose left -hand-sides  ( lhs ) are matched agains the source structure , I~h?r ? , wed L ~ ctmaca ~ , es where filler-gap ~ nt kndm in one language oorreapond to antecedent-pco ~ oun dependencies in another  .

This is , of course , just a straightforward adaptation of the traditional transfer method to a A : V data structure in place of a tree  , in particular , it re~mbles a classical transt ~: r system in being ' structural'i  . e . in involving the decomposition of source structures into smaller objects  ( on the lhs )  , and the actual construction of targets trUc -tures  ( on the rhs )  . This is essentially the approach employed in ELU ( Estival et al 1990 ) and MiMo2 ( van Noord et al 1990 )  . 
Though there is not much discussion of the treatment of referential dependencies in tmnst'er in these formalisms  , it is easy to see how one can deal with re -entrances which natur-ally fall within the scope of one transferule  . In ELU , tot example , such re-entrances can be translated by binding the reentrant paths within the structure to rite same variable and stating n correspondence b tween the relevant source side and the target side variables  , in this way the re-entrance is translated as one structure  . In MiMo2 the reentrant paths are separately translated , but the re-entrance is explicitly mentioned on source and target side  , requiring token-identity between the results of the separate translations  . However , these structure based formalisms do not have any method for geucral ~ ing this to cases where re -entrances are not ' local '  . This is serious , because phenomena classically regarded as involving Wh-Movement  ( e . g . Wh-Questions , Topicalization , Relativisa-tion , etc . ) , are typically of this kind , and for these phenomena , the formalisms can provide no general treatment . 
Of course , there are a number of ways in which one might try to remedy this inadequacy  . 
For example , one could unfold there . entrances as type identities ( i . e . reinterpret the DAG as a tree ) , or ' thread's hared values through the structure  , in such a way that they become local ( cf . standard gap threading techniques to reduce unbounde dependencies to local ones  )  . However , none are satisfactory . The former looses information , so that source FS and target FS are no longer equivalent  , and causes problems in generation , where some method must be found for ensuring that lexical content is not duplicated  , and appears in the right place ) . Threading techniques are unattractive because of the  ( often extreme ) complication they introduce in grammars and representations  .  2 2 . 2 . Constraint Based Approaches
In this section , we will outline the approach to the translation of nonlocal re-entrances proposed in Kaplan et al  ( 1989 )  . 
In LFG projections are linguistically relevant mappings or correspondences between levels  , whether these mappings are director involve function composition  ( Kaplan ( 198"0 , Halvorscn and Kaplan (1988) , Dalrymple (1990) and Dalrympl et al (1990)) . By means of these projections , equations can be stated which co-describe elements of the two levels related by the projection  . The standard projections are V ( normally expressed in terms of t and ~ , , from c-structure to f-structure ) , and o ( variously from c-and f-structure to semantic structures  )  . 
Kaptan et al extend this approach to provide what amounts to a transfer lormalism for LFG  . 3 In their proposal , the equation a language of LFG is used to state bilingual constraints or correspondences between elements of source and target structures  . They introduce mapping functions x ( between fstructures ) and T ' ( between semantic structures )  . Achieving translation can be thought of ns specifying and resolving a set of constraints on target structures  , constraints which are expressed by means of the " ~ and x ' functions  . 
The formalism permits a wide variety of source -target correspondences to be expressed : and ap can be composed  , as can x ' and o . Equa-lions specifying translations are added to ( source language ) lexiual entries and c-structure rules . 
For example (2) composes " ~ and ap , identifying the ' r of the ( source ) SUBJ f-structure with the SUBJ attribute of the x of the f-structure associated with some node  ( the value of t )  , indicating that the translation of the value of the  SUB3 slot in a source f ? structure fills the SUB3 slot in the f-structure which is tile translation of that source  2 The possibility of a ' threading ' apl noech i a hinted at in van No or det d  ( 1990 )  . The formalism described in Pu\[man ( ed )   ( 1991 ) seems to allow an intc~ating variation , where instead of threading infonalatiot labout nonlocal re-eaatmnee throttgh the ~ oorce at metom  , it in threaded through the ' virtual ' atructur ~ that ambuilt the tmlmfer mechanisms reeura ~ through the aoene estructure  . This still tk~e~no lavoid the htmic objection to the toe of auchtech hique a  , however .

In this approach , then , relations between differentypes of linguistic description  ( i . e . levels ) are defined in terms of correspondence funetiom , not by means of there . cursive application of rules to source language structures  . In particular , notice thaitmmfer does not opomt e compositionally on a source language feature structure  , rather the analysis procedure collects sets of constraints on various structures  , including ('0 constraints on target structures . The solution of a set of z equations is a ( probably incomplete ) target f-structure which must then be completed and validated by the target grammar  . This allows information which is exhaustively determined by the target grammar to be ignored in the transfer prooms  . 4In this sense , the system is constraint-based , rather than structure baaed like the approaches described in  2  . 1 . 
above , and it has different expteasive possibilities . 
As regards relative clauses , Kaplan et al assume a reasonably standard LFG analysis : wh-relatives are represented as an attribute  ( here
RELMOD ) which contains are . untrunce between the values of a RELTOPIC plL rese and a within-clause function  ( see ( 8 ) below )  . The approach to translating these dependencies involves stating separate correspondences for both the within clause function and the RELTO- 
PIC function.
For a simple example like (3), with
English as source language , the rules are as in ( 47 ) and the English and ( incomplete ) French fstructures as in ( 8 ) and ( 9 )   ( the indices here are simply informal devices to allow easy reference to pieces off-structure  )  .

In the functional uncertaimy equation in (5) , XCOMP , COMP * allows the ' gap ' associated with the RELTOPIC to be inside zero or more COMPs or XCOMPs  , and GF is an abbreviation for a set of paths including length one paths such as SUBJ  , OBJ , etc . , and paths of length two , such OBL to OBJ , which allows preposition stranding , as in man who iI replied to Hi ( 8 ) IRELTOPIC e2\[PRED'who'\]\]\] ( 9 ) \[RELTOPICf2\[PRED'QUE'\]\]\]

This can be seen by looking at the relevant con -stmints  , in (10) , which are derived from these roles in relation to  ( 8 ) and ( 9 )  . Since x is a function ,   ( fxRELTOPIC ) and ( ftOBJ ) must he the same token . Hence the desired re-entrance falls out automatically  .

Unfortunately , , this approach is only capable of producing intuitively correct structures in cases where the conditions on unbounded dependencies are parallel in the source and target languages  . On closer inspection , the example Kaplan et al use to demonstrate heir approach does not work correctly  , giving the ungrammatical ( 11c ) instead of the correct ( llb )  .

From these rules , the following x equations arise , in relation to ( 13 ) :  ( 14 ) z ( ~' RELTOPIC ) - ( - ? tRELTOPIC ) x ( eT . ) = ( ftRELTOPIC)z(1'OBJ)-('t1'OB~oOID )

The pmhtem in this case arises because the relativised p~itiom in English and French are not identical  . Although it seems at flint sight that the approach nicely preserves re-entrances in tramlation  , in fact what happens is that the source grammar dictates what will be reentrant on the target side  . Thus , though the Kaplan et al approach provides a simple method for projecting source language re -entrances onto the target language structures  , the method is insufficiently flexible in the scope allowed for variation between source and target structures  .

Characteristic of the approaches de . a cr the d in 2 . 1 . and 2 . 2 . is that they mm slate beth ' ends ' of are -entrance  . Because in structure based systems the translation relation is defined entirely by rules  , the scope of the re-entrances that can be handled is limited by that of rules  . A constraint based approach avoids this problem- -under the approach described in  2  . 2 separate x correspondences are supplied for both paths involved in the re-entrance  ( both the source RELTOPIC , and the source within-clause function ) .

However , as we have seen , this approach does not permit factorization of source and target oriented information in these cases  . 
In this section we will explore a solution to this problem which involves restricting " ~ correspondences to just one of the paths involved in the source re-entrance  , allowing a constraint based treatment of cases including those in  ( 11 ) above .   8 T iffs possibility is not easily available in ' structure based ' approaches  , and represents a genuine advantage of a constraint based approach  . 
3.1. Different Re.entrances in Source and

Suppose that no " ~ equations are stated on the c -structure rules introducing the RELTOPIC attribute  , and a " c correspondence is stated only over the path terminating in the within clause  ( thematic ) function . What results would be a French f-structure like ( 16 )  , which differs from ( 15 ) only in the absence of a RELTOPIC , and would correspond to the string j ' air ~ ponduhlaquelle  ( 'I have responded to which ' ) :  ( 16 )

In order to produce an f-structure corresponding to  ( lib )   , i . e . a translation of ( lla ) , we must ensure that an appropriate value for a RELTOPIC attribute is given  . There are three sources of potentially useful information here  . 
First , there is some source-oriented information -- the solution to the functional uncer-a Kaplant ta /propose jmt such n treatment in cases like the trantlmtion fJ~hn is likely to suMary--II ? ~ ttprobab/?qu *  ,   . /tanwrra Mar /? .

tainty equation associated with the XP node in the English c-structure  . The solution of the functional uncertainty equation in this case happens m be  ( tRELTOPIC )  -  ( tOBJ )   . By me application of a general schema , we can derive ax equation from this , which in this case is (17) , which ( again in this case ) is equivalent o(18) . 
(17) ( xtRELTOPIC)-T ( tO 13 . 1) (18) ( x?RELTOPIC)-(xtOBL~oO 13 . 1 ) The method for doing this involves taking the functional uncertainty  , namely tRELTOPIC = tXCOMP , COMP*GF , and adding ( xtREL-TOPIC ) -x ( ta ) l brevery solution c t of the uncertainty on the right hand side  . This gives (18) as one solution . 
Of course , this cannot simply be added to the other x equations  ( if it were , it would establish are-entrance between RELTOPIC and OBLso  O13  . I , which would give an ungrammatical result , with a stranded preposition , as in (11c ) above ) . 
Second , the monolingual target grammar will contain a constrain to ensure that  , if REL-TOPIC is present , some path within the REL-TOPIC attribute contains the attribute value pair WH-+  . This is required to prevent the ' topical-izing '   ( i . e . wh-movement fronting within the relative clause ) of any XP which does not contain a wh-phrase . Simplifying slightly , we take this equation to be: ( 19 )   ( TRELTOPICOBJ , POSS*WH)-c+Third , the target grammar itself contains a functional uncertainty equation for establishing a relation between RELTOPIC and some within-clause function  , which , for the sake of argument we could assume to be us in  ( 20 )  . 
Notice that this is more restrictive than the corresponding English constraint  , which allowed identity between the values of a wide variety of GFs and the RELTOPIC  . This restricts it to SUBJ , O13 . I , and ' thematic ' OBLiques ( which includes OBL go )  , excluding the possibility of preposition stranding  . 
(20) ( tRELTOP1C ) = ( tCOMP , xcoiPI * strm , OBJ , OBL ~) Intuitively , the source-derived equation ( 18 ) is used to provide the information that there should be a RELTOPIC attribute in the  AC1T  .

It can he interpreted efcasi-bly in combination with the target information to lind the closest possible solution consistent with the target grammar  . This closest solution emerges from comparing the constraint with the functional uncertainty equations for the target language  . In the case of relative clauses , at least , there are two target functional uncertainty equation so-the first expresses are-entlance between the value of RELTOPIC and the value of some within clause function  , and the second requires RELTOPIC to contain a WH ~+ path  ( (1 . 9) and (20)) . 
If the source-derived equation is consistent with the target constraints  , then it is chosen . If it is not , then the closest solution is chosen . Note that the shortest path in ( 19 ) would have just the wh-item in RELTOPIC ( the OBJ of the preposition )  . But this is ruled out by (20) , which disallows OBL goOBJ as the hot-tom of the mm ~ rtainty path  . The " closest " solution is defined as the pemfissibie solution whicfi contains the minimal solution of the equation  ( 19 )   ( which requires RELTOPIC to contain a + WH item )  . In this case , that solution is: ( 21 )   ( 1' OBL~o )  -  ( 1' RELTOPIC )   ( 22 )   ( ~' RELTOPICOBJWH ) -+ Incobiuation with the other constraints , this will give a representation like (23) , corresponding , to (11) b , as intended .

In this case , since French requires pied-piping rather than preposition stranding  , the closest solution turns out to be the one which involves the attribute-value structure which contains the one specified in the source -oriented constraint  , with no other containing possible structure intervening  . But the mechanism can be applied equally well to derive " smaller " RELTOPIC phrases from " larger " structures  , as in the English-*French pair in (24) , and can be extended to deal with ' strategy mismatches ' of the kind exemplified in  ( 25 )  , whine a ' gap ' in one language corresponds to a resumptive pronoun in another  ( see Arnold and Sadler 1992 )  .

A  ~ , ~ here , the basic idea would be to translate the material in rite within clause position only  , ignoring the RELTOPIC position , and then create a re-entrance on the target side . 
There are at least two problems . First , instun > tuml approaches , the normal operation of lmnsi~er requires soure kind of completeness check to eusure that all parts of the source structure are translated  . Nomlally , this can be interpreted as a check that every path in the source object has been visited  . Thus , for this approach to work , one would need rule . , ; that explicitly translate the value of RELTOPIC us nil  ( ' deleting ' it )  . One could , alternatively , try to redefine completeness in terms of translation of all values  ( since the RELTOPIC and the within clause position have the same value  , translating either would count as translating both  )  . This would mean one could avoid the rules explicitly deleting the RELTOPIC  , but it is not clear what consequences it would have else ow here  . The second problem is more serious . The output of transfer will produce a structure like man\[\[\]  1 have seen who \] , and one will need roles to create a link between the RELTOPIC position  ( /\] )  , and who . But one cannot , in gen~eral , assume that such rules will exist . For example , they will not exist if the target grammar creates links as part of the parsing process titat creates A:V structures  ( e . g . if they are associated with c-structure rules ) , and even if theyate rules that can be applied to already con?structed A:V structurns  , it cannot be guaranteed that they will apply to configuration such as this  ( since they will have been written to apply to cases where the lexical material  ( who ) f-commands the ' gap ' ; but in the structures output from transter , the relationship will be the reverse .

We have shown in this paper that the approach to transfer between feature structures introduced in Kaplanet  al1989 can be exploited to deal with the translation of anaphoric dependeneins  . Our proposal exploits the constraint based ( rather than structure based ) nature of the approach , and the flexibility that comes from being able to underspecify various parts of the translation relation  , and allow infor-nmtion ( i . e . constraints ) from source language , and target grammar to interact with bilingual information  .
