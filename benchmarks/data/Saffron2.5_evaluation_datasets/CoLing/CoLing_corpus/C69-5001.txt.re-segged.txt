MY paper will deal with the theoretical and practical 
questions of the co-textual analysis of texts.
The theoretical frame is contained by the chapters
titled Introduction and Conclusion . MY aim here is to show that the automatization of the text analysis expects the accumulated experiences of the general linguistics and the documentation-theory to be summed up in one coherent the o~z  . The linguistics has to examine the problems of documentational thesauri  , abstracting , indexing from its own aspect , and has to insert these means and methods of the documentation in the system of the text-analysis  . 
The practical questions , certain concrete phases of the co-textual analysis of texts are dealt within the chapters  2 and 3  . In connection with certain steps we hope our demonstrative examples to contain solutions that will necesss ril ~ become simpler further on  . Our aim was , first of all , the presentation of the complete process on a special type of text  . Not all the parts of this complete process can be automatized yet  . But the presentation will always happen with respect to the automatization  . 
The next step should be the getting up of an analysing system that is built on the thesauristic elaboration of a relatively not big material  . Then we have to solve such special problems of certain phases of the analysis that could not even mention in this flow chart-like survey  . 
Beside and after the theoretical analysis , only this can be the test of the usefulness of the system  .

INTRODUCTION i . _IBefore I should analyse the problems of the technical means and a method for the text analysis  , I should like to touch a more general question . I wish to give a short sketch of the connection between the method to be presented and the problems of the modern theory of grammar and theory of documentation  . 
To see the connections of the theory of grammar clearer  , let us start from Figure I . 
Every message is an element of a net of connections/context /  , ~etermined by time , geographical place , cultural environments etc . The linguistic analysis can set the only aim of discovering the inner/co-textual/linguistic structure of the text with the demand of completeness  . 
/It can draw near to the contextual connections only to an extent that is made possible by the structure of the dictionary having used at the analysis  . /The co-textual analysis -- and the immediate constituent and sentence analysis that are organic parts of ~ t -- can be done on diffe rentw~s  . 
The Figure 1 shows the components of Chomsk~'s gemerative theory  . Chomsky's generative process /@/ starts from the ' base component'/B/o The deep structure of the sentence/DS/comes to existence from the sentence-basis by filling it up with I ex ic ~ lelements in the ' lexicon '/ L/  . The surface structure/S ~ comes to exis tence by using different kinds of transformations in the ' transformational component '/ T/  . /The situating of the lexicon and the transformational component in Figure I wishes to demonstrate that we may need turning to the lexicon even  -2  -

-3-during dispatching the transformations . /The proper interpretating components/IDs and IS ~ provide the surface and deep structure with phonetic and semantic interpretations  . These interpretations , to a certain extent , relate to the extraling u is ~ icrealit ~ already . 
The phonetic interpretation contains the basic elements  , too , necessary to the real pronouncing of the sentence  , beside the phonological interpretation of the surface structure/PHTR = ~ honetic representation /  . /The elements originating in the speaker's subjective interpretation either settle on or colour this  . /The semantic interpretation -- beside the establishing of the semantic character of the immediate constituents -- trends to the discovering of logical connections independent from language  , hidden behind the given verbal representation / LOSR = logical semantic representation versus LISR = linguistic semantic representation /  . 
A part of the investigations included by the generative linguistic theory  , like other examinations of other kinds , raise the possibility of generating sentences on another way  , too . I This generative process/G'/starts from the universal logical construction/LOSR /  . /The universal logical construction is a net of connections containing  , notion-words , 2 . /We have to order a linguistic structure/DS/- -reflecting the characteristics of the ~ v ~ n language -- to this construction  , and make a concrete sentence of it/SS/ . 
The way of the sentence-analysis/A/is of the opposite direction to both  . At the same time , our sketched analysis is built on the theoretical basis  , which has developed during the investigation concerning the problems of the generative processes/G and G'/summarize ~ above  . But , as the text analysis goes beyond the- 4 -boundaries of the sentence , we have to widen the sentence-centered theoretical basis  , as well . 3I . ~When analysing the notion'text-structure'we can make a difference between the linguistic and the sound-textural components of the text  . Both can be linearly and hierarchically patterned . 
The ' linear patterning ' is a net of the recurrences of elements that interweave the whole text  . The ' hierarchical patterning ' means the way as the text as a whole is built up from the basic units of the structure through the levels of the composition units of different complexity  .   4 Of course there are texts where the sound -textural component is the organizer of the structure  , but as it is not mY intention to deal with this now  , I shall ignore their problems at present . 
A great part of the essays dealing with text analysis considers making lists of the structural elements of similar construction  . /It mostly remains among sentence-boundaries , so the use of a sentence-centered theory is enough  . /These lists are undoubtedly essential characteristics of a text  , but they reflect only one aspect of the text structure  . This is what I called ' linear patterning ' . 
The other -- and , from a certain point of view more important-- aspect is the ' hierarchic ~ l patterning ' of the text  . Its analysis means much more problems . 
The problems are different , according to the types of texts . Even if we consider only the most homogeneous texts -- the sclent ~ ficdidactic prose or the prose told only in the third person not containing indirect speech ---  5 -- i even then we meet the following basic problem : gr smnatical/syntactic  , semantic/connections can be discovered only among sentences constructing the socalled ' paragraphs '  . 
/At the same time , no one has yet established the types of it , neither has s~yone described its rules as a system  . /larger text-units ~ han'paragraphs'only such connections can be shown that are carried by the ' content structure '  . Thus , beside the examination of the grammatical construction of the ' paragraphs ' we also have to look for the means to help us to di scover the connections of this kind  . 
_I . 5 On this field we can get the greatest help from the documentation theory  . During the last ten years the documentalists wrought out means and methods that will probably prove useful at the analysis of not scientific texts as well  . 
I should like to mention the thesaurus as the most significant means  . The thesaurus -- asknown -- is a notion -dictionary serving for the normalization of the indexing and searching language  , which provides the different connections among the notions  . It is this feature , that I think makes this means very useful to the linguistics for its own purposes  , too . 
From the methods those of the abstracting and automatic indexing may become significant in our analysis  . 
In the text analysis there is a ' great obstacle ' , that the texts are too extensive . For the sake of making the analysis easier and the hierarchical structure clear cut it is both useful and necessary to replace the larger structure-units by their abstracts  . When speaking of abstracting -- though abstracts made by statistic methods may mean a good help temporarily -- I do not think of  -6 -statistic abstracts alone . 
In a broad outline these aspects of the documentation theory mean the wider frame  , in which certain questions of the following analysing method can be examined  . 

ONTHEME ANSOFTHECO-TEXTUAL ANALYSISO FTEXTS In my opinion  , the following means are necessary for the co -textual analysis of texts : I  . a thesaurus including different sectors ; 2 . a rule-system working on sentences : a /phonological  , morphonological rules , ~ b/syntactic rules , c/semantic rules to the linguistic semantic interpretation to the logical semantic interpretation  ;  3 . a system of the syntactic-semantic rules of the basic composition units  ;  4 . a rule-system of an abstracting process ; 5 . a rule-system of a process that is able to establish the thematic connections of a ' text ' consisting of abstracts  . 
In this chapter I want to deal only with the questions of the structure of the thesaurus in details  . 
The work of all the rule-systems is based on the below-sketched thesaurus structure  . 
2.1 The thesaurus
The base of the linguistic analysis has to be a thesaurus that unites the structures of the thesaurus made for the purpose of documentation and that of the lexicon having developed during the general linguistic-  7 -linvestigations . 
Such a thesaurus consists of two main parts : the sector of definitions and that of classifications  . 
2.1.1 On the sector of definitions
The head words of the documentational thesaurus -- combining the structural characteristics of the more important thesauri  5 -contains the following constituents : head word /descriptor / 
SY synonyms
EQ equivalent terms
TR translation
DEF definition
S~scope note
SF semantic factors are
ISF is semantic factor of
FIELD field , thematic group
CAT category/material , feature , process /
BT broader terms
BT-LOG broader terms-logical
BT-WH broader terms - whole
BT-CON broader terms-connected/terms to which the head word is connected but not as a logical broader term or a whole/narrower terms NT 



COL collateral terms



ASC associated terms
ASCR associated reflexive
ASCT associated to i
ASCF associated from
EC empirically connected
Let us demonstrate these constituents by the thesaurus-entry of two concrete words :  -8 -/ bird /




BT-LOG-WH
NT-LOG-PT-CON




ASCF tenger/sea /




BT-LOG-WH
NT-LOG-PT-CON

DEF - - that contains SF and CAT
We did not meet TR and SN in these examples , though in certain cases they may be necessary also in nontechnical texts  ; E . g . at foreign words and geographical names related to the given language archipelagus / archipelago / 
TR ' in sular world'-9-f


SN ' the main river of Middle-Europe / and Hungary /" 
SN ' the capital of Sweden'
The DEF/the lexical definition/has to contain the following informations on the base of the results of the linguistic theoretical research referring to a lexical unit/LU/:  6

..... OTH ......
I have dealt with the construction of the lexical entries and grammatical morphemes in the thesaurus above  . 
I should like to add the following to what I told so far  . 
I . By dividing the entry of the thesaurus into a lexical definition/LDEF/and a the ssuristic information block/a thesauristic definition : TDEF/  , the verbally-II-imanife stating knowledge can be separated from the socalled encyclopedic knowledge  . 
2 . The syntactic informations of the lexical definitions naturally contain only the informations relevant in the given language  . 
3 . The semantic informations are demonstrated here only with a lexical definition  . Of course this is not the form that I find suitable but the definitions written in a semantic metalanguage  . 
4 . The thesauristic informations are the results of a multihier archical classification  . For expressing them we have to elaborate the own 'notional language ' of the thesaurus  . 
5 . The information FIF/J9 points to the groups and fields into which the notion represented bx the given word is classified  . The group and field structure has to unit the virtues of the thematic classifications of the linguistic thesauri/Roget  , Dornseiff / , the documentation thesauri and the illustrated dictionaries  . But its re~lisation can be built only on a classification-theoretical basis  . 
6 . For reaching a satisfactory or suitable degree of the division of the informations BTNT and COL we have to analyse it further  . 
7 . When defining the informations ASC we--of course--think only of the minimal informations that can be defined with a relatively big probability  . We wanted to mark the indefiniteness of the definition by selecting it from the others with a dotted line  . 
- 12 -2 . 1 . 2 On the sector of classifications The sector of classifications first of all has to contain an alphabetic index that includes all the roots of words and grammatical morphemes  , with reference to the form by whicn they can be found in the sector of definitions  , /Beside the basic alphabetic index we may construct a na-tergo list and a morphematic ~ IC list as well  . This latter one reflects the connections SF and ISF  . /Different special classifications can be made on the basis of the lexical and the the ssuristic informations  . 
Lexical classifications :
The classes of lexical units having the sames ~ntactic categories ~ semantic markers  , conditions ~ syntactic semantic ~ B~2~B ~ , oeoeoo
The classes of derivative endings , suffixes, . . . . . . of the same character . 
Thesauristic classifications : fields of the elements having the same FIELD marker 
Different 8n ~/ or hierarchical associat & venets.
We can provide the classifications with- 13 -lidentificators , and we can order the identificators to the thesaurus entries  . 
Thus the atr ~ cture of a thesaurus-uni ~ is as follows: 
L-~EF/lexical definition /
T-X~F / thesauristic definition /
I~ENT/identificators/2 . 2 As I have already mentioned , I do not wish to deal here with the other means of the co-textual text analysis  . We can feel the character of their structure at the presentation of the way of analysing  . Their real elaboration can be realized only on the basis of a profound analysis of the mutual influences of all themes ns  ,   9@ ONTHEME THODOF THECO-TEXTUAL ANALYSISOF TEXTS  3  . 0 The algorithm of the analysis The process of the co-textual analysis of texts consists of the following larger units : 
I . the segmentation of the texts , 2 . the discovery of the grammatical structure of the individual sentences  ,  3 . compiling of special text-thesauri , 4 . the discovery of the net of connections of the I communication units  , the establishment of the basic composition units ,  5 . making the abstracts of the basic composition units  ,  - 14 -6 . the thematic analysis of the text consisting of abstracts -- in more steps  . 
3.1 The segmentation of the text
The notion of ' text ' is interpreted on the basis of extralinguistic criteria  . The text is always given to us . The ' whole ' is obvious owing to typogrsphical reasons or ~ mainly in case of spoken texts -- the beginning and the end are determined another way  . 
For illustrating the method of analysis we have chosen a written  , ' simple narrative text ' , one that contains only communications in the third person and may be direct speech in the first person beside  . The boundaries of the segments of the primary classification -- as we have  8 written text--are marked by the author's punctuation-marks + The text chosen to % he ~ emonstration and its informativ English equivalent are as follows  . /The bi~erline-spaces sign the boundaries of the paragraphs located by the author  . /

Gulls joined the track of the ship and I was looking at them  . 
They were bigger than those at the Danube : seagulls  . 
Sometimes they rose quite up to the deck and the funnel  , then flied down above the waves , and the splashing cold foam bathed them again and egain  . 
They accompanied the ship as if they had been a to w-boat to it  . 
There was rhythm in their swaying and hovering.
Sometimes they darted up above mY head , they probably expected metofeed them . 
I must have been a strange picture : one sxngle black passenger on the deck ! and screech xng  , crying , per emtory , spray-white gulls around me .

Roughly this succession is the way from ~ through
Issto ~ on Figure I.
The steps from 3 to 6 happened on the basis of the lexical / the eauristic/informations  . 
The ' conditions ' informations / CO1/ of the substituted lexical units mean a certain prediction referring to the  8nal~sis both inside and outside the sentences . For example the compulsory complement of the verbs makes it possible to look for the compulsory  , possible and not complement like adverbs 81gorithmically  . 
The logical semantic interpretation of the deep structure makes it possible on one hand to establish the syno~ymity of sentences  , and to discover the net of thematic connections of the text on the Other  . 
3 . 3 The compi!inE of special text-thesauri After finishing the analysis of the sentences we compile different kinds of special text-thesauri  . 
It is this point where the whole interpretation of the linear patterning of the text takes place on the-  23 -/ level of sentences . I have dealt with its problems in details t another place  . Here I should like to mention only the things that are necessary for the further investigation of the analysing process  . 
~ . _~ . _I First of all we make the index of the word forms of the whole text  . After the wordforms this index gives the numbers of the sentences in which the given word form occurs  . We shall neglect the complete presentation of this index  , we shall just give the list of the roots of nouns  , verbs and adjectives that occur more than one time  . 
/Considering the shortness of the text , a word occurring ? twice can be relevant as well . /The underlined numbers in the list sign the ' implicite ' occurrences of the given words  . /Wespeak about implicit occurrences when the given word is represented by pronouns  , verbal endings or demonstrative pronouns . Their identifications with the proper words have to be done already at the semantic interpretations of the sentences -- and have to be signed by a special code in the continuously compiled text-dictionary  . /

3 . 4  . The discovery of the net of connections of t . he communication units_~ . _~ . _IAfter the analysis of the sentences and the compilement of the special text-thesauri we have to discover the structure of the basic composition units  . 
Let us see what is at our disposal at the beginning of this process  . 
We have-the 9 trans-eegmentated ~ text ; /On the basis of the sentence-analysis we can separate ~ on the one hsnd~smaller units in certain ? sentences of the author N we have written the text in this form in the pages  1519-- and in certain cases we may contract two sentences into one unit on the other  . /The units gained by the trans-segmentation are called not sentences out communication units already  .

? ~ . _~ . _ 2 Let us examine here the_s~stem of the connections discovered among the communication units  . 
The list below contains the following conventions : -   27 -fX/YX is a constituent ordered ~ mmediately under X/if Y is the dominant sentence itself  , we never write it out / , X/Z/Z is an information that defines the character of the constituent X more precisely -- if it is e number it stands for the communication unit that contains X as its constituent  , /after a semicolon we have the concrete lexics l unit that keeps the communication units in question together /  , 
X : : Y Y is the definition of X ,
X = rX  is the repetition of the constituent Y , X : Y the missing constituent X is identical to X  , X-:Y the constituent X refers to Y/s t and s for Y /  , The underlined constituent on the left of the signs -  ,  : , or -: represent the proper paraphrases tanding on the right  . 
NP , VP , AdvP are immediate constituents , NPo the ' subject ' is marked only by the verbal personal suffix  , the ' subject ' is marked only by the adjectival predicate without copula  ,

/We cannot find predictions in this text.
We presented some of the special text-thesauri in  ~  . 3 . / ~ . ~ . 5 As the compositional analysis starts with the analysis of communication units we build the definitions of the higher units on the notion ' communication unit ' instead of the indefinited notion ' paragraph '  . 
But we need some ' transitional notions ' , too : What we calls continous communicational chain/CC / is the succession of communication units with predicates of first person indirect speech  . /In this ~ ext we can see it in the communication units  12  . 2 - 15 . 2 . /What we call a simple block Of communication units/SB / is the -- mostly continuous - - chain of the communication units all of which contains on_  . _~e explicite or implicite reference element pointing to the same ' reference '  . This reference element has to be replaced ~ the ' referred element '  , if we want to give the semantic interpretation of the communication unit  . 
-~0-1 ~ at we call a complex block of Commun , ication units/CB/ . is a -- mastly continuous - - chain of communication units connected by more ' referred elements ~  . 
 #For example the communication units 16 . 1 - 21 . 2 for maSB , the communication units 8 . 1-l0 form a CB . /We mean the basic units of the compositional structure the following way : We shall call basic composition unit/or comp@aition unit of the first de ~ ree/the structure unit that forms one thematic unit and that comes to existence immediately from the communication units  . /This always has to consist of more than one communication unit  . The ' or phan communication unit ' inserted between the composition units forms a compositio nunit of the zero de  , Tee . /Generally : we shall call composition unit of then degree the structure unit that also forms one thematic unit and that contains composition unit of the/n-l/degree as well  . 
5 . ~ . ~ Both the simplex and the complex blocks of the communication units and the continuous communication chains sign some kind of the compositional dissection already  . But the discovery of the compositional structure demands a detailed thematic analysis  . 
At the thematic analysis the first fixed point is meant by the ' referential elements '  . 
When the referential elements hold not many communication units together  , this mostly means s smallest thematic unit , too . 
Inside the longer simple blocks and in the parts of the text outside the simple and complex blocks the discovery of the thesauristic connections among the lexical-  31 -units may help us to separate the composition units  . 
The projection of the continuous communication chain on the text can mean a help of another kind  . 
/The thessuristic connections separate for example the communication units  3739 / ~ insulgr world ' ~' from island to island '-- ' islands'/as one independent composition unit  . 
The communication chain helps at the compositional segmentation of the text consisting of the communication units II  .

3 . ~ The process of makin ~ the abstracts of the basic composition units The making of the abstracts of the composition units established in  3  . 4 happens in more steps . 
_5 . _5 . 1 We take the composition units one by one and reduce their deep structures  . 
This means that the constituents containing the most frequent words and the ones expressing time are left  , the other constituents of completive character / that is AdvP embedded in NP/S or NP/VP/S/are omitted  . 
/ Na ~ urally , the ' deep structure ' means only the incomplete deeps t ~ ctures containing the really existing constltuents of the original communication units here too  . f Then we write out the surface representations one by one according to the formerly reduced deep structures  . 
As the result of this step we shall get the following  , reduced text ' . /Here we illustrate this process only with the composition units I-ii  . / i . There are peoplest anding on the bridge of the Danube  . 
They are looking at the gulls.
2 . I often see these birds at our reach of the Danube as well  . 
Sometimes they dart up high.
3. But I have seen gulls above these a , too.
4 . Then the weather had already turned to winter -like  . 
The birches of the islands hone yellow.
The North Seadashed against its granite coasts with anger  . 
- 33 -5 . Myship had started from a Finnish harbour and was leaving for Stockholm  . 
6 . Wherever we passed , there were often appearing some granite islands . 
There were pines and birches on it.
7 . There were lonely lighthouses to wering on some of them  . 
8. The wind was wuthering on the deck.
The waves threateningly dashed against the side of the ship  . 
9. I stayed out on the deck for a time.
I0. I sent f are well to the Finnish coasts.
I had such a homely feeling there.
Ii . I have never seen Italy.
I have always been drawn to the Northby m ~ desire  . 
~ . 5  . 2 Before beginning the second step of making the abstract we have to examine the orphan blocks consisting of more communication units  . We have to decide if they represent one or more composition units  . 
This is relatively easy in cases like that of the composition unit  8  . Its two communication units are connected in their content by the explicite thesauristic connection between the ' deck ' and the ' side of the ship'/both are the parts of the ' ship'/  . /We can find an implicite connection as well : " the wind was wuthering "  , " the waves threateningly dashed " , the question is to what extent can this be made expll cite  . /The communication units of the composition unit II are connected in their form by the pair of adverbs never-alw ~  . 
The composition unit 4 raises mo?e problems already . 
We can establish from the ' birches of the island ' u on the basis of the later occurences of the ' island ' and the ' birches '/ see the composition unit  6/-- that it refers to the birches of sea islands . The ' granite island '- ~4 -' granite coast ' connection also links the two last communication units  , The ' turned to winter-like ' stands only in a slack associative connection with the predicate ' dashed  . . . with anger ' , but it is not in any explicitely demonstrable connection with the predicate'shone yellow '  . 
Thus we could regard the second and third communication units as an independent composition unit  . 
3 . ~ . 3 In the next step we substitute the separate composition units by one communication unit  . This means the choice of one communication unit / preserving its original form /  , or we have to generate a new one--originally not occuring in this form  . 
To be able to carry out these tasks we must have the co~lete analysis of the sentences of the reduced text  . 
The choice can happen on structural and/or statistical basis  . 
We choose for example the first communication unit from the reduced text of the composition unit  16 on structural basis because the others are such attributes of the NP of this communication unit that can be regarded the paraphrases of the attributes occuring inside the communication units /' plaintive '--' pain fully crying '--' sad '/  . 
We choose for example the second communication unit from the reduced text of the composition unit II on statistical basis because this is connected by ' North ' to the other communication units  , while the first one is not connected by ' Italy ' . 
We choose the last communication unit from the reduced text of the composition unit  18 on structural and statistical basis . Structurally because this is an- 35 -i answer to the first two asking communication units  , and statistically because the last-but-one communication unit contains NP-s that occur only once in the whole text /' swallow '  , ' yellow-bird ' ,   . . . / . 
we generate/that means a generating of ~ When type--see Figure I/both the structural and the statistical aspect plays an important part  . Actually it is enough to speak of generating only because the choice can be considered as a kind of generating by which we make a communication unit identical with one of ~ heoriginal communication units  . 
Let us demonstrate the character of generating by making the abstract of the composition unit IQ  . 
The logical deep structures of the communication units of this composition unit are as follows :/ I/P : says fare well to s  . lv:I's ~: coasts
Iisg : coasts : Finnish where : coasts
P.-f ~ eels one self somehow : homely
Considering the paraphrase-possibilities of the / i / and  /2/ and the tenses occuring in the text we can generate the following sentence from these : ' I said fare well to the hp~ely Finnish coasts  . ' or , holding to the structure of the text : ' I sent f are well  toward9 the hom ~ lyFinnlah coasts . '
I'When we generate , of course it is not necessary to condense all the informations -- hidden in the logical representation -- into one sentence  . 

After the generating or the choice of the sentences we get the following ' abstract-text ' :   20  . 


I . People on the bridge of the Danubearelooking at the gulls  . 
2 . I often see these birds at our reach of the Danube as well  . 
3. But I have seen gulls above these a , too.
4 . Then the weather had already turned to winter -like  . 
5 . MYship passed from a Finnish harb our towards Stockholm  . 
6 . Wherever we passed , there were often appearing some granite islands . 
7 . There were lonely lighthouses to wering on some of them  . 
8. The wind was wuthering on the deck.
9. I stayed out on the deck for a time.
I0. I sent f are well to the homely Finnish coasts.
ii . I have always been drawn to the North by ~ f desire  . 
12. Gulls joined the track of the ship.
13 . If they had not accompanied me , that severe and stor~seamurnfulness would have been unbearably depress h ~  . .
14 . How good it is , that they are crying : " Our country Is these a . " 15 . Only theirs ?16 . Suddenly a plaintive bird-voice stroke my esrs . 
17 . The group of the cryin ~ birdies was fl\[ing over the ship  ,  18 . May be these are not migratory just movlng birds . 
19 . Do they d are to shulder the journey above the angrily waving sea because the islands are not very far from each other ? The sailors throwout scrapings to the gulls  . 
But who feeds these tiny birds of these a ? This recklessness that shoulders the journey above the sea is encouraging for one who has sor row inside like me because I am carrying a dear deceased in m~self  , ~ sometimes something cries in me just as those tiny dear birds cried above my head  . 
The informations condensed into the abstract of the literary text are relevant with different character than those of the scientific % ext  . In this abstract ~ composition unit has to be represented by a communication unit  . 
-57-r3 . 6 The , ,thematic anal~sis of the ' abstract-text ' Among the communicati ~ units of the ' abstract-text ' we can establish very few connections with the character of those in the primary text  . Here it is rather the thesauristic connections that come forward  . The analysis is similar to the one told earlier . Its result can be summarized as follows . 
The different the ssuristic connections dissect the text of the abstract the following w ~ v : i-  2 ' the Danube ' 3  -  22 ' thesea'/In all the composition units except I  ,  2 ,  4 ,  15 ,  16 ,   18 we can find ' these a ' itself or some element being in some thesauristic connection with it  . /The 12 forms a composition unit of the second degree , its other connecting element is the ' gulls ' . 
We candxs solve further the unit kept together by the'sea '  . The inner ' ~ hematic connecting elements , of the so-gained composition units of the second degree are as follows:  5  -  7 ' passed '+' islands ' 9 - ii Person I 12  -  14 ' gulls'+'ship ' 16  -  19 ' birdies ' 20  -  21 ' feeding ' This compositional division will obviously meet the net of connections of the communication units of the primary text  . The orphancomposition units/3 , 4 p8 ,  15 , 22/include the orphancommunication units . 
The composition units of the second degree of the unit linked by the ' sea'form two composition units of the third clegree :  /5   -7  /+  /911/ : Person I~myship , , ' I remained ' , 'Isent , , '~ desire '/ / This includes the composition unit  8 as well . /  /1214/  +  /1619/: ' bird'/either as a primary lexical unitor as a semantic and - or thesauristic element // This includes the composition unit  15 as well . /The compositional structure of the whole text can be summarized the following way:

This recklessness that shoulders the journey above these a is encouraging  22 In the hierarchical structure we cannot establish levels equally valid to every text  , but we can define the ' depth-level ' of every composition unit as the compositional distance measured from the  , whole of the work of art ' as the broadest composition unit  . /The upper- 59 -rline of numbers marks the depth-levels . /We can observe that we can meete g . a composition unit of the first degree on the most different depth-levels  . 


My paper dealt with the questions of the co -textual analysis of a special text-type  . I tried to delibe rate on the complete text -analysing process algorithmically  . This process has parts than can be done automatically already now  , and theoretically--I suppose--all its parts can be automatized  . But the practical realisation expects the solution of different problems that are among the key-problems of the linguistics and the documentation  . MY intention was first of all to show how these are connected even at the analysis of the simplest text  . Finally I should like to point to some problems of basic importance again  . 
~ . lBefore the compilement of the thesaurus we have to select the socalled ' notion-words '  . Mostly these ~ notion-words'take place in the sector of the thesaur~stic definitions  . 
We also have to elaborate the ' semantic basic language ' by which the words of the given language can be semantically defined and we have to define the system of the relations to be used in the semantic definitions  . 
/The ' notion-words ' are words , the elements of the ' semantic basic language ' are of feature character  . /The thesaurus has to provide the interrelations among the different ' notion-words ' and the different ' lexical units '  . These interrelations are of one-many- 40 -character :


That is : more lexical units/LDEF/m~y belong to one ' notion word '/ TDEF /  . 
_~ . 2 The relation ' logical semantic representation ' --' linguistic semantic representation ' is an analogous equivalent of the relation ' notion word'--' lexical unit '  . 
The ' logical semantic representation '/ LOSE / represents ' logical connections ' among ' notion words '  , while the ' linguistic semantic representation ' /LISR/represents ' verbal connections ' among ' lexlcal units '  . 
/In fact ~ LISR is a deep structure that demonstrates the semantic character of the constituents  , too . /In connection with these we have to define the systems of both the logical and linguistic connections  , the way of their representation , the correspondence of these two systems of connections  , and the way of passing over from one to the other . 
The interrelations are here interrelations of sets and they are also of one-many character  . /That is : to s given set of elementary logical relations more different text-structures can belong  . These text structures one Dy one may contain only as many independent deep structures as ~ he number of the elementary logical relations  . /The efficacity of the analysing system first of all depends on the determinedness of the elements and relations of the logical and linguistic system and of the rules of -  41 -r the matching between the two systems . 
~ . ~ We have to mention that the relation of the phonetic and phonological representation is also analogous to the above told one  , though this analogy contains an oblique symmetry . This is a natural consequence of the continuous and one-way one-many relation passing from the logical representation to the phonetic one e_~  . _ ~ From the point of view of the relation of the linguistic deep and surface structure the structure of the syntactic informations and the condition informations of the LDEF is of primly importance  . It is significant to approach it from the transformations  . 
/That is , we have to ~ examine to what extent the concrete lexical units occuring in a given deep structure determine the character of the transformations to be used  . / ~ . _ 5 It is only a solution of the above sketched problems happening on  8 theoretical basis forming one coherent system that makes possible the solution of such questions as-the automatic realization of the transitions from the surface structure to the incomplete deep structure  , from the incomplete to the complete deep structure  , from the deep structure ~ D the logical repre sentation ~- the automatic discovery of the thematic connections built on the TDEF-s  , -the automatic establishment of ~ he--in the g iven connection -- irrelevant elements of the deep structure  , -the automatic realization of the reduction building on their relevant elements  ,  -  42 -flna ~ Av - the automatic dispatching of the generating of G'character necessary during the process  .
