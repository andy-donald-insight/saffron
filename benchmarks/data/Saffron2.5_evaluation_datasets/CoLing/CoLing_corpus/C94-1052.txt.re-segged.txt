Abstract
This paper describes the enhancements made , within a unification framework , based on typed feature structures , in order to support linking of lexical entries to their translation equivalents  . To help this task we have developed an interactivenvironment : TGE  . Several experiments , corresponding to rather " closed " semantic domains  , have been developed in order to generate lexical cross-relations between 
English and Spanish.

Lexicons , electronic dictionaries , machine translation . 
1 Introduction
Recently , several approaches have been made to extend lexical unification-based formalisms to deal with multilinguistie phenomena in order to be used in applications such  , as Machine Translation \[7\] . 
Within Acquilex IP Project , a unification framework based on typed feature structures  \[4\] was ddveloped , the LKB ( Lexical Knowledge Base) , in order to represent conceptual units corresponding to lexieal senses  , lexical and phrasal rules , multilingual r clalionships , elc . 
This paper describes the enhancements made , to the LKB system\[6\] , in order to support linking of lexical entries to their translation equivalents  . The organisation of the paper is as follows : Section  2 presents the motivations and formalisation of t links  ( for " translation links " )  . Section 3 deals with TGE ( T links Generation Environment )  , the way we propose to help in constructing lexical linkages semiautomatically from LKB data and bilingual dictionaries  \[13\]  ,  \[8\] , loaded in the LDR ( Lexical Data Base ) environment\[5\] . Section 4 shows the use of ' l'GE 1 This researcher has been snported by a granto . f the Departament d ' Ensenyament ( ~\]' Generalitat de Catahmya .  91-

within SEISD4\[1\] ( Sistemade extracci6n de Informacidn Sem~ntica de Diccionarios )  . In section 5 some experimental results , are presented . Finally in section 6 we present our conclusions , and furtl ~ erlines of research . 
2T links
The initial assumption was that the basic units for defining lexical translation equivalence should be the lexical entries in the monolingual LKBs  , which should , in general , correspond to word senses in the dictionary . 
Although in the simplest cases wec , 'm consider the lexical entries themselves as translation equiv  , -dent , in general more complex cases occur corresponding to lexical gaps  , differences in morphologic or lexical features , specificity , etc .  \[11\] . 
We will therefore represent the relationships between words in terms of t links  . The tlink mechanism is general enough to allow the monolingual information to be augmented with translation specific information  , in a variety of ways . We will first describe the tlink mechanism in the LKB and then outline how some of these more complex equivalences can be represented  . 
The LKB formalism uses a typed feature structure ( FS ) system for representing lexical knowledge . So we can define t links in terms of relations between FSs  . Lexical ( or phrasal ) transformatious in both source and target languages ~ are a desirable capability so that we can state that at link is essentially a relationship between two rules  ( of the sort already defined in the LKB ) where the rule inputs have been instantiated by the representations of the word senses to be linked  . 
As shown in fig 1 , furniture can be encoded as translation equivalent to the plural muebles by specifying that the named rule plural has to be applied to the base sense in Spanish  . As any other LKB object at link can be represented as a feature structure  , as shown in fig 2 . The type system mechanism , in the LKB , allows further 4SEISD is an interactivenvironment built within Acquilex project in order to help in constructing the LKB entries from the LDB sources  .

refinEmEnt and differentiatio q of tlink classes ill several ways  . A simple-t link is applicable whenever two lexical entries which denote single place predicates  ( nouns , etc . ) arE straighfforwardly an equivalent translation , without any previous transformation . Thus , assuming that the LDOCE \[9\] sense absint hL 0   1 is translatio , lequivalent to the VOX\[12\] sense absent a XI1 , we will have tile next tlink : simple tlink < fs0:1 > == absinth L_0_I < fst : 1 > ~ absent a XI 1  . 
The " syntactically sug~tred " version , which appears in t link files , is : absint hL01/absentaXt1:simple-tlink . 
A partial t link is applicable when we want to transfer the quidia structure from one sense to anc  ) ther , and a phrasal tlink is necessary when we need to describe a single word equivalent translation to a phrase \[  I0\]  . 
3 TGE : T links Generation Environment
The establisment of t links can be obviously perlbrmed manually  , but the multiplicity of possible cases and the existence of several Knowledge St  ) nrces ( such as bilingual dictionaries , monoling t , al LDBs , or amt dd lingual \[ . KB ) allows and motivates the ( parlizd ) antomalizalion of the process . To help in perl'orn~ing such a task w chave developed an interactive environment : T  (  ; I . \] . 
TGE has been implemented using a Production Rules approach  . This approach was already used within the SEISD enviromnent  , ' rod was mainly motivated by the need of providing a flexible and open way of defining tlink formation mechanisms  . The core of TGE is PRE ( production rules Environment )  , a rnle-orieuted general purpose interpreter\[2\] . PPd ~ follows the philosophy of most Production Rules Systems  \[3\] but is deeply adapted to Natural Language applications  . PRE offers a powerful ( according to both expressiveness and performance ) rule applicatio , Imecljanism and provides the possibilities of defining higher level mechanisms  , uchas rules cts ( allowing inheritance capabilities )   , and of choice , ' unong control strategies , either us Er-definEd or provided by the system . Consider the following example : ( rule rule-l-all rules et al control for ever priority l  ( translation-in"trans-records ( ? translation * rest ) ) ->  ( modify 1"trans-records ( * rest ) )  ( create a ' anslation ^ trans-ps or tsnil ^ trans - record ? translation ^ tlink-typenil^checked nil  ) ) In this rule the pattern-condition is the occurrence of an object named translation-in ill the Working Memory  . 
This object mustill tUrn contain a ^ trans- records attribute whose value will be matched against file pattern  ( ? translation * rest )  . If the matching succeeds then . :/2 . 5 translat ion will be unified with the first element of tile list and rest with the remainder elements  . The action part of the rule consists of two actions  . The t'ormer is the modification of translat ion-in  , popping its first element , and the latter performs the creation of another object  , named translation . Rule-l-all rule is applied until all the objects n  , -uned " translation-in"have emptied the list contained in their slot " trans-records  . 
4 Us ing TGE fo r generat ing T l inks The TGE may be considered a toolbox att d thus  , it doesn't impose a fixed methodological strategy  . Whatever methodology we follow , several decisions must be taken : the kind of control we need  , the rule sets to be designed , " the rules belonging to each ruleset , the relative priority assigned to each rule , and so on . 
As regards the control strategy , one of tile following four alternatives may be chosen l breach source entry  ( see\[2\] of\[10\] for futher details ) : ? All , which executes all tile rule sets . From tile proposed Oinks , finally the user chooses the correct ones . 
? Collect , which executes the rule sets one at a time and provides the results to the user  ( for selection of the correct ones ) every time a rule set succeeds . 
? One-by-one , which orderly executes the rulesets , and stops as so on as one of them succeeds . 
? Select , which only executes the rulcsets that the user chooses  . 
An initial set of modules was designed according totile typology of t links presented so far  . It included four sorts of Oinks that showed distinct conceptual correspondences between both languages  . A more in depth study of EnglishSpanish mismatcfies  \[11\] might lead to an enrichment of the typology , and co , lsequeully to a need I brextending the extant modules  . 
Upt Onows even modules , each one il n\[lumeul cd , ' is a rule set , have been developed . Fach of them generates one out of/he three kinds of t links stated above  . Each module follows a different strategy to guess a possible t link  , taking account of the lhree accessible knowledge sources  . 
? Simple Tlink Module , this is tile case when there exists a direct translation of the source entry in the biling uN dictionary  . Ex , ' unple : absent axi 1 --> absent a LKB source entry absent a --> absint h bilingual dictionary absint h --> absinth  L_0 Il . KB targct cntry absent ax_i_I/absinthI .  0_1:

" absent a " is translated in the bilingual dictionary by " absint h "  , ABSINTH L_0   1 is a valid lexical entry of the target lexicon , and therefore a SIMPLE-TLINK connecting both entries is created  . 
? Orthographic Tlink Module , this case occurs when in both languages the same word with exactly the same spelling is used  . The relbre , no bilingual dictionary is needed . 
? Compound Tlink Module , this is the case when the corresponding entry in the target lexicon is a compound one  , being the target lexio'd entry made up of the concatenation f the two English words that appear in the bilingual entry  . 
? Phrasal Noun Tlink Module , this case takes place whenever the translation is the concatenation f two other nouns  ; for example , the Spanish nouns for trees often correspond . to wo nouns in English , ( like limonero-lemon tree , melocotone ro-peachtree , etc . ) . More complex cases can be recovered by using different grammar rules  ( also implemented within the LKB formalism )  . 
? Parent Tlink Module , this is the case of those very specific terms in the source lexicon which are not treated in the bilingual dictionary  , but whose hypcronyms in the taxonomy have a clear translation that can generate a partial t link  . 
? Grandparent Tlink Module , this is a very similar case to the previous one , in which the source word's grandpm-ent is used to produce the partial t link  . 
? General Tlink Module , this is the case when the translation appearing in the bilingual dictionary is composed of more than one word  . Normally these explanations are made up as definitions in the form of a genus  , plus some modifiers . At link connecting the source entry and the genus appearing in the definition must be crcaied  . 
We will illustrate the tlink generation process with an example of an entry for which a number of different dinks have been generated  , namely batido XI5 . In figure 3 where bat ido_XI5 appears with the tlink options , we had selected file option all and subsequently , all tile possible t links have been suggested by the system  . 
I lowever the TGE allows for other selection criteria  . As we can seeiu figure 3 , five t links are suggested by tile system for this p ~ ticular example : I  ) The first option is not a correct one . Among tile various translations given for the source LKB entry  batidoX_15 the adjective shot appears . Because another syntactic realisation of shot is that of a noun denoting a drinkable thing therefore it is included ill the t  , ' uget subset .

5 Results
Several experiments corresponding to rather " closed " and narrow semm~tic domains have been performed  . We discuss next thosc con'es l~mdingIt"drinks " \[   I0\]  . 
The Spanish taxouomy of ( lrink-n(mns , cxu ' acted from VOX dictionary , consists of 235 noun senses at ndh : ls5 levels . The English taxonomy of dritk-nouns , exlracted from LDOCE , consists at '192 not resenses . Some of the obtained results are the following : ? While translating f  , ' om Slmnish to l~lI , jlish ,   223 out of 235 drink-nouns have been linked by means of different aud often more than one t links  ( 95 % )  . However , only 52 English nouns have been linked with Spanish nouns  ( 27% )  . Out of these 223 drink-nouns mentioned above , 210 have been linked by using ( mainly ) the biling u : d dictionary as a translation resource while the rest  , 13 of them , have been linked by means of the orthographic -t link rule set and consequently  , the gap of the bilingual dictionary has finally been bridged  , for in both hntguages the stone word with exactly the same spelling is used  . For example , chart reuse Xl 1 aud chart retts e_ . L_lO , sherry Xllmid sherry L0_0, etc . 
?  74 out of 235 source I+KB entries for drink-nouns are also bilingual entries  ( 31 , 5%) . Consequently ,   161 source I+KB entries have no corresponding bilingual entries  ( 68 , 5%) . This biggap in the bilingual dictionary is due to the \[ acth at the onensed  , VOX/llarrap's , is a very basic one , and as such it only contains 32 , 463 senses , lu contras the VOX monolingual Spanish dictionary covers a total of  143  , 700 senses . 
?  30 out of tilt translations of tilt 74 source I+KI \] entries which were found in the bilingual dictionary are also tm'getI+KB entries  . Consequently , the translations of 44 bilingual entries have uo corresponding target I + KB entries  . 
?  13 out of 16l source LKB entries arc also target LKB ? For most entries  , more than one t link type has been extracted . The total number of t links which have been generated and selected for the t  , ~ xonomy of bebid a XI_3 ( drink ) with the explained software is 372 t links . Next we show the different links generated by each ruleset and the amount of lexical entries of each language involved  .

6 Conclusions
In this paper we have presented TGE . an enviromnent designed and built in order to help in the recovery of crosslinguistic relations  . We have reported , an described results of an experiment for automatically extracting the relations of equivalence for Spanish and English drink-nouns by using the TGE software  . The resulting process is semiautomatic , whilst the tlink generation is performed automatically  , the selection of the desired tlinks is done manually  . 
All the tlink-rulesets l ~ aveworked satisf , q clorily , therefore resulting in a considerable part of the subsets being linked  ( 95% of the source lexicon )  , tlowever flmse PRE tlink-rule sets have only been tested over limited subsets of specific semantic fields  . Its actual potent i : d will be proven in a later stage  , once its application to larger and less restricted sets of word senses takes place  , including also categories which , are not considered to be nouns .
