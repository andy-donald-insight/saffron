Non-stylistic studies of The Book of Isaiah have given rise to several hypotheses concerning the authorship and integrity of this Hebrew text  . In this paper we establish some stylistic criteria for the confirmation or refutation of these hypotheses  . 
Clustering methods were found to be a useful addition to the conventional statistical methods  . The chapters of the book are presented as points in an n-dimensional Euclidean space  , where ~ is optionally determined . The coordinates of these points present statistical and other measures of the morphological features of the words of the appropriate chapters  . Clustering methods were applied to these points .
