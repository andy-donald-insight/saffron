Why should computers interpret language incrementally ? In recent years psycholinguistic evidence for incremental interpretation has become more and more compelling  , suggesting that humans perl Torm semantic interpretation before constituent boundaries  , possibly word by word . However , possible computational p-plications have received less attention  . In this paper we consider various potential applications  , in particular graphical interaction and dialogue . We then review the theoretical and computational tools available for mapping from fragments of sentences to flflly sco-ped semantic representations  . Finally , we tease apart the relationship between dynamic semantics and in-creinental interpretation  . 
APPLICATIONS
Following the work of , for example , Marslen-Wilson (1973) ,   . lust and Carpenter (1980) and Altma . nnal \] d Steedrnan (1988) , it hasher oine widely accepted that semantic i11terpretation ihn man sentence processing can occur be ibre sentence boundaries and even before clausal boundaries  . It is less widely accepted that there is a need for incremental interpretation i computational applications  . 
In the \[970s and early 1980s several compntational implementations motivated the use of ' incremental in-  . 
terp retation as a way of dealing with structural and lexical ambiguity  ( a survey is given in Haddock 1989 )  . 
A sentence snch as the following has 4862 different syntactic parses due solely to attachment ambiguity  ( Stabler 1991 )  . 
1 ) I put the bouquet of flowers that you gave me for Mothers ' Day in the vase that you gave me form y birth day on the chest of drawers that you gave me lbrAr mistice Day  . 
Although some of the parses can be ruled out using structural preferences during parsing  ( such as \[ , ate C ' lo sure or Minimal Attachment ( Frazier 1979 ) ) , extraction of the correct set of plausible readings requi-resuse of realworld knowledge  . Incremental interpretation allows online semantic tiltering  , i . e . parses of initial fragments which have an implausible or an-olnalous interpretation are r qiected  , thereby preven -*' . l Phis research was supported by the UK Science and Gn-glneerlngl ~  . esearch Council , H , esearch Grant 1tR 30718 . 
Ling ambiguities from multiplying as the parse proceeds  . 
However , on qine semantic filtering for sentence processing does have drawbacks  . Firstly , for sentence processing using a serial architecture  ( rather than one in which syntactic and semantic processing is perfor-lned in parallel  )  , the savings in computation obtained from online filtering have to be balanced against the additional costs of performing selnan ~ ic computations for parses of fl : agments which would eventually be ru-led out anyway from purely syntactic onsiderations  . 
Moreow ~ r , there are now relatively sophisticated ways of packing ambiguities during parsing  ( e . g . by then se of graph-structured stacks and packed parse forests  ( 2 blnita 1985 ) ) . Secondly , the task of judging plausibility or anomaly according to context and realworld knowledge is a difficult problem  , except in some very lilnited domains . It , contrast , statistical techniqnes using lexeme cooccurrence provide a relatively simple mechanism which can imitate semantic filtering in many cases  .  1 , brexample , instead of judging bank as alhmncial institution as more plansible than bank as a river bank in the noun phrase the rich bank  , we can cornp are the number of cooccurrences of the le-xemcs rich and  bank1   ( = river bank ) versus rich and bank 2 ( = financial institution ) in a semantically analysed corpus . Cases where statistical technique seem less appropriate arc where plausibility is affected by local context  . For example , consider the ambiguous sentence , The decorators painted a wall with cracks in tim two contexts  517~c room was supposed to look " run-down vs . The clients couhln't afford wall paper . Such cases involve reasoning with an interpretation in its immediate context  , as opposed to purely . judging the likelihood of a particular linguistic expression in a given application domain  ( see e . g . Cooper 1993 for discussion ) . 
Although the usefulness of online semantic filtering during the processing of complete sentences is deba-table  , filtering has a more plausible role to play in interactive  , realtimenvironments , uc has interactive spell checkers ( see e . g . Wirdn ( 1990 ) I'or arguments for incremental parsing in such environnlents  )  . I I ere the choice is between whether or not to have semantic ill-tering at all  , rather than whether to do it online , or at the end of the sentence .

One possibility , which has been explored mainly within the Categorial Grammar tradition  ( e . g . Steedman 1 . 988 ) is to provide a grammar which can treat most if not all initial fragments as constituents  . ' Phey then have full syntax trees from which the semantics can be calculated  . 
However , an alternative possibility is to directly link the partial syntax trees which can be % rmedfol : nOl > COn stituents with flmctional semantic representations  . For example , a fragment missing a noun phrase such as John likes can be associated with a seman-I  , ies which is a function from entities to truth values  .

The problem of there being an arbitrary mmg ) er of different partial trees for a particular fragment is re-fleeted in most current approaches to increment M interpretation being either incomplete  , or not flflly word by word . For example , incomplete parsers have been proposed by Stabler ( 11991 ) and Moortga . t (1988) . Sta-bler's system is a simple topdown parser which does not deal with left recursive grammars  . Moortgat's M-Systeln is based on the Lambek ( ~ah : ulus : the problem of an infinite lmmber of possible tree ka  . gments is replaced by a corresponding problem of initiM fl : ag-ments having an infinite number of possible types  . A colnplete incremental parser , which is not fully word by word , was proposed by Pullnan (1986) . This is ba . ~sed on arc-eager left-corner parsing ( see e . g . lesnik Toelmb Ie complete , fully word by word parsing requires a way of encoding an intinite n m n ber of partiMl  , rees . There are several possibilities . ' Fhe first is to use a language describing trees where we can express the fact that  , \] ohn is donf in at cd by the suode , but do not have to speciiy what it . is il mnediately domina-ted by ( e . g . D-Theory , Marcus et ah198a ) . Semantic representations could be tbrmed word by word by extracting ' default'syntax trees  ( by strengthening do-minance links into immediated ominance links whe-rever possible  )  . 
A second possibility is to factor out recursive structures from a grammar  . Thompson et al ( 1991 ) show how this can be done for a phrase structure grammar  ( creating an equivalent ' Pree Adjoining (   ; rammar ( , Ioshi I987)) . The parser for the resulting grammar allows linear parsing t bran  ( infinitely ) parallel sy-stem , with Cite absorption of each word performed in constant time  . At each choice point , there are only a finite number of possible new partial TAG trees  ( the TAG trees represents the possibly in linite nmn-bet of trees which can be for lned using adjunct on  )  . 
It should a gMn be possible to extract ' default ' semantic values  , by taking the semantics from the TA ( I tree ( i . e . by assuming that there are to be , to adjunctions ) . 
A somewhat similar system has recently been propo -sed by Shieber and Johnson  ( 191t3 )  . 
The third possibility is suggested by considering the semantic representations which are appropria  . te during a word by word parse . Although there are any number of dill'trent partial trees for the fragment Mary thinks John  , the semautics of the fragment can be represented using just two lambda  expressions6: 
AP . thinks ( mary , I ) ( john ))
AP . AQ . Q(thinks(mary , P(john )))
Consider the tlrst . The lambda abstraction ( over a ( ; Two represent a ~ , ions are appropriate if t : here are no VP-modif iers as it  , dependency grammar . If V1)-modificatlon is Mlowed , I , wo more expressions are required : AP . AR , . ( II , ( kx . thinks ( mary , x ))) ( P(john )) and 5p . an . . aQ Q((ll,(Xx . thhlks(mary,x)))(P(john))) .

The second exl ) re . ssion(~fimctiona \] item over type e-+t ; and t-+t ) , allows for eventual structures where the main senten <: e is embedde  . de . g .

Z ~ IbEverygM in the class showed a rather strict new teacher the results of her attempt to get the grammar exercises correct  . 
This intuitive evidence can be backed up by considering garden path effects with quantifier scope tun-biguities  ( called jungle paths by Barwise 1987 )  . The original examples , such~s the f bllowing ,  9 ) Statistics show that every 11 seconds a man is mugged here in New York city . We are here today to intervie whiln showed that preferences for a particular scope are established and are overturned  . ' Poshow that preferences are sometimes established before the end of ' a sentence  , and before a potential sentence nd , we need to show ga . rden path effects in example such as the following  :   10  ) Mary pttt the in Ibrmation that statistics show that every  11 seconds aman is mugged here in New York city and that she was to interview him inherdiary Most psycholinguistic experimentation has been concerned with which scope preferences are made  , rather than the point at which the preferences are establis-hcd  ( see e . g . Kurtzman and MacDonald , 1993) . Given tile illtuitive evidence , our hypothesis is that scope preferences can sometimes be established early  , befbre the end of a sentence . This leaves open the possibility that in other cases  , where the scoping in Ibrmation is not particularly of interest othe hearer  , preferences are determined late , if at all . 
3 . 1 Inc re lnenta l Quant i f ie r Scoping : hnp le - lnent  , ation Dealing with quantifiers incrementally is a rather si-mila  . r problem to dealing with h'aglnents of trees incrementally  , a , stasitis in- , possible to predict the level of embedding of ~ r noun phrase such as John from tile fragment Mary thin L's John  , it is also impossible to predict the scope of a quantifier in a fragment with respect ~ o the arbitrarily large number of quantiliers which might appear later in the sentence  . Again the problem can be avoided by atbrm of pacldng  . A particularly simple way of doing this is to use unseoped logical forms where qmmtifiers are left in situ  ( silni-larto the representations ued by Hobbs and Shieber  ( 1987 )  , or to Quasi Logical Form ( Alshawi 1990)) . For example , the fl ' agment Every man gives a boot " can be given the tbllowing representation :  I1  ) k z . gives (< V , x , nlan(x ) > , < ~ , y , book(y)> , z ) Each qn antitied term consists of ' a quantitier , ava . ria-ble and a restrictor , but , nobody . To convert lambda expressions to unscoped propositions  , we replace an occurrence of each argument with an empty existen-tia  . l quantitier term . In this case we obtain : 12) gives (< V , X , ITIall(X ) > , < 3 , y , book(y ) > , < -~ , z , ' l '> ) Scoped propositions can then be obtained by using an outside-in quantifier scoping algorithm  ( Lewin ,  1990) , or an inside-out algorithm with a freew ~ riable constraint  ( IIobbs and Shieber ,  1987) . The propositions f brlnc d can then be judged for plausibility  . 
To imitate jungle path phenomena , these pla . usiobility judgements need to feedback into the scoping procedure for the next fragment  . For example , if ' every man is taken to be scoped outside a book after processing the fragment l ? v crymang a ~ c  . a book ,  \[ ; hen this preference should be preserved when deterlnining the scope for the full sentence l ? veryuza ~ t gave a bookloa child  . Thus instead of doing ~ dl quantitier scoping at the end of the sentence  , each new quantilier is sco-ped relative to the existing quantifiers  ( and operators such as negation , intensional verbs etc . ) . A preliminary irnplemenl , ation achieves this by annotating the semantic representations with no denantes  , a . nd recording which quantifiers are ' discharged ' at  . which nodes , and in which order . 
DYNAMIC SEMANTICS l ) ynamic semantics adopts the view that " the mea- -ning of a sentence does not lie ill its truth conditi-ons  , but rather in the way ill which it changes ( tile representation of ) the in\[brmation of the intcrl ) reter " ( Groencn dijk and Stokho\[' ,  \]991) . At first glance such a . view seems ideally suited t . o incremental interpretation . Indeed , Groenen dijk and Stokhof claim that the compositional nature o\['l  ) ynamic Predicate Logic enables one to " interpret a textir ~ an onlinentauner  , i . e . , incrementally , processing a . nd interpreting each basic unit as it comes along , in the context created by the interpretation of the t  . exts of a . r' . 
Putting these two quotes together is , however , misleading , since it suggests a more direct mapping between incremental sem~mtics and dyna  . mh : semantics than is actually possible . In an incremental semantics , we would expect the inform tttiou state , of an interpre-ter to be updated word by word . In contrast , in dyna-mic semantics , the ol:der in which states are updated is determined by semantics t  ; ructure , not by left-to-right order ( see e . g . I , ewiu , 1992\[br discussion ) . For example , in 1) ynanficPredicate Logic((~roenendijk , ~ S tokh of ,  1991) , states are threaded from the antecedent of a conditional into I  , he conseque ~ d ~ , and from a restrictor of ' a quantitier into I ; hebody . Thus , in interpreting , 13) John will buy it right away , if a car impresses him the input state for ev Muation of  . John will bug it right away is the output state from the a  . ntecedent aearhn p , vsseshhn . in this ease the threading through semantic structure is in the opposite order to the order in which the two clauses appear in the sentence  . 
Some intuitive justification for the direction of threading in dynamic semantics is provided by cou -sidering appropriate orders for evaluation of propositions against a database : the natural order in which ill  ( \[ the ll see if I . he COllSC(lUOlll , ci . ll 17 c : l ) rove li . \] to is () lily ai , tile sentence lew ; liu , siniplena , r r a t i v e t e x L s 0 h a , tI , hel)l ; esenl ; al , ionordoritll dI , hoiw , l , ur ~ dor dero\[4" wahl3J ; ionnecx~s , <sarily coincide .
