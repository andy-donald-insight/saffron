This paper describes an implemented utoring system  ( 2 )  , designed to help students to generate clitic -constmctions i French  . 
While showing various ways of converting a given meaning structure into its corresponding surface expression  , t be system helps not only to discover what data to process but also h ~_~ this information processing should take_place  . In other words , we are concerned with efficiency in verbal planning  ( performance )  . 
Recognizing that the same result can be obtained by various methods  , the student should find out~d chone is best suited to the circumstances  ( what is kr~n , task demands etc .  ) . Infon ~ atio-hal states , hence the preeesser's needs , may vary to a great extent , as may his strategies or cognitive styles . In consequence , in order to become an efficient processor , flu student \] as to acquire not only S\]RU CilRa_ or RULE-KNOWLEDGE but also PROCEDLI~-~_EIX ~  ( skill )  . 
With this in mind we have designed three modules in order to foster a reflective  , experiment alttitude in the learner , hel-ping him to discover insightfully the , Dst efficient strategy . 
i . ~ TION
It is wellknown that the same output can be achieved by several methods  . For example , a given set of sentences or texts can be generated by a variety of equivalent but different grammars  . 
Any of U~se grammars can be used in numerous ways.
Grammars are generally noutra \] with respect to processing  ( 3 )  . They pertain only to competence and performance factors such as memory load  , focus of attention , etc . lie out of their scope . 
l h3oc ~\] different granmars may be equivalent in terms of their product-they all produce the same result  , i . e . the same set of sen-fences - they certainly dif ferinte  , ~ ns of the processing , that is to say in terms of their relative efficiency  ( speed , memory load , etc .  ) . 
Whereas most scholars werking in the domain of generation denot deal with strategies  ( 4 ) -they consider but one way to reach the solution - ~ e will be concerned by the procedural in lolications of using a given gra  , marina variety of ways . 
Instead of having co , loeting grammars , we will take one of them ( 5 ) and l~e late its efficiency to the way it is used . \]\]\] is per-fot manoe-orionted approadl seems justified on theoretical as well as on practical grounds  ( economy and flexibility of processing )  . 
Let us take , for example , a student who ~ uld like to be-cone fluent in French  . Obviously , he would have to learn not only what to process , but also how to process in order to efficient ly convert a given meaning  ( conceptual graph ) into its corresponding expression ( see tenee )  . In oN~erwerds , our student has to learn not only a set of g cammatical rules but also a set of strateqies or operating principles  ( 6 ) powerful and flexible enough to get from a given input  ( meaning ) to the output ( sentence ) in the most economic way , i . e . with the fewest operations , with the least storage , and wiN\] the minimum amount of transformations . 
2. PROCE 55, FUNCTION OF STRUCTL~:
It is a wellknown fact that students learning French have dif-fienlties in producing fluently sentences with  2 pronoun ccmploments such as : Dis-lemoiV-OO-lO Tellme  ( tell me it ) Nelelui dispas ! neg-DO-lO-V-negDon'tell him  ( that ) !I iteled on nor a S-IO-DO-VH e'll (  . live it to you Iilelui de one raS-DO-IO-VHe'll give it to him Jet e  pr6sente ~elle S-DO-V-prep-lOI ' Ii pres ~\] te you to her It is interesting to find out why these constructions are so difficult to learn and to process  . We believe that there are three basic reasons for this : i  ) the structurali die synera eies oF the French system : mor ~\] ology and syntax are interdep ~ant  ;  2 ) the procedural implications of this structure : many morphemes have an embedded structure  ( see below )  ;  3 ) the resource limitations of the l~mn processor : being a serial processor  , the learn or can focus h is attention on but one thing at a time  . 
2.1 STRUCIIP#~PARTICIIARITIES :
French pronoun constructions are complicated because syntax and morphology are interrelated  , form as well as position depending upon each other  . Their generation implies that one is capable of dete ~ nLning at least three things : - the fom\] of a given referent : for example  , the concepts SPEAKER or 3d PERSON can be realized in any of the following forms : 
SPEAKER : je,me,moi3dPERSON : il , e\] . le , ils , dies , on , s e , sol , le , la , i es , lui , lent , cux ; -its position : In the affinnative mode there are three positions or sentence-frames : a  ) 5-10-DO-Vilmelepr 4 sente ( he presents him tome ) b ) S-DO--IO-Vill-eluipr 4 sente ( he presents him to her ) c ) S-DO-V---prep-I_O 0 ilme~sonte ~ elle ( he presents metoher ) -~ letber the preposition , inherent in the base , should be made explicit or not . As the examples ( b ) and ( c ) clearly show , the same verbe on stmction may or may not require elision of the preposition  . Either one affects form as ~ ell as position (7) . 
It should be noted that while most verbs allow only for two patterns in the  . declarative mode('a ' and ' b') , those with an animate object such as ' pr6scnter  '  ( to present ) allow also for ' c' . 
566 2 . 2 I-I~OCE 1 ) LI~L\]M~t ICATION ~: ~ tmlir ~ dsttc constraints operate on all levels : phono\]  . ~ ji-caI , mr phol(~jical and syntact . i . cal . 
a ) H~onoloqi ~ il constraints : lhedetemdnation of ~ ) rpbology generally requires three ope-rations ( porsen , case , nL raber and so ~ Keimes gender ) , yet : pronouns aren ~ no syl . labie . \] inc ~ isequencc , one cannot plant l~i~xt pronoun while uttering tl ~ eut'rc ~ ltone as the pronoun uttere diston short and the time needed for planning the next ~ e being too long  . 
b ) Morphological.om~straints :
There are number of cases where the indirect object has an embedded structure  , i . e . U  ~ . morl ~ ology of ' the indirect object de-p~Js upon information cx~dng from the direct ~_~ t  ( 8 )  . This implies intercup Lion of a routine . Suppose that the sentence : 3d ~ presents Paul to Mary is to be . prononinalized . Tile proble mist tk ~ detemdnati ~ of form and position of Lt ~ prc ~  ) nos , referring respectively to " Paul " ar ~ J to " Mary "  . The indirectob ~ ( Mary ) lexicalizes either as LUI or as EI?E , dopending upon ~ , ther the direct ~ .   ( Paul ) rcl ) re-sents the sgeaker/lister ~ rora3d person , in this latterense ( e ) the verb follows the indirect object , va ~ ereas in the for rmr(d)i . t precedes it . 
( d ) ilme prgsen be ~ EI_LE ( he presents ~ m to her )   ( e ) ille LUI pr4sento ( he presents him to her ) e )   5Vntactical constraints : lhelir ~ rorder of tile corlstitoents carl generally not be established  , u ~ til both objects are known . Incons ~ ce , at least one of the . t ~ o elements bast obe stored in werkLngnmmory . 
( f ) i . 1 le\]ui donne he give ~ sitto him ( S-DO-IO-V )   ( g ) il meied on nehegives it tome ( S-IO-DO-V ) Suppose that the . direct object has been processed right after U ~ subject  . In that ease one I < nows its form but not tlcce~sa -rily its position  ( ' f ' or ' g ' )   . This latter de ~ x ~ nds upon the vah ~ of the indirect object  . If U~indirect object is in tlm first or second person it precedes the dit'ect objeet  ( g )  , otherwise it Pol- . lows it ( f ) . Should ~ e start by processing the indirect object before the direct one  , we might have to keep tl~e fommr in working memory  , lhisis precisely the case of " f " ~ ere the indirect object is in U~ethird person and not tm f lexive  . As one can see , in bethsih ~ tions one is faced with unwanted storage problems  . 
Obviously these structural particularities of tlm Frend ~ pron  ( xm system have implication ~ not only for U ~ e process of learning but also for the process of generation  , namely : they exclude any ~ ord-to-word processing  , and they * ~@ Jirea certain amount of prepl~dng or look-algld  . 
~latis neededtl~n , in order tO avoid false starts or cor-reetions ( bad < tracking )  , i . sglobal plann in c ~ on Um clause level rat ) mr than local pl . an nlnc ~ on the word level . 
In the light of tl~-~sefacts one has to ad~t that gm tree-ration of pro~m constructions in Frend ~ isi ~ ot all that simple  . 
Althe ~ jh the relevant features ( rules ) are simple in nature , their interaction is highly conlolex . It is U~s not surprising that students take a \] . ongti . ~ to understand all U ~ intricacies of the system  , ~ ieh would allow U~-mleventually to integrate the rules into an efficient prccess-mode i  .

By asking specific questions ( per-sc~l , gender , nm~er etc . ) , the systems shows ~ d chin formoti ~ Js relevant ~ hm determining form as well as position  . ~hile answering these questions the student incrementally determines the final form of t ~ sentenc * ~  , lhefollowing example may illustrate Ute proeess : by the user :

The system demonstrates which information should be processed and in what order  . It also shows under ~ hat conditions movement of constituents are necessary  . These per'-mutations are g ~ own on the screen , so that the user can learn ~ deh features control those movements  . Furthermore , the results of the processed date are shown online  , i . e . the form and position of the ~ ord determined are shown instantaneously  . Finally the system tells ~ hether the newly determined item can be articulated right a way or not  . The system is thus explicit with respect to rule knowledge and optimal in temm of processing  . The result is obtained in the most economic way . 
The disadvantage of this sys~-drivm processing reside in the fact that the solution  , or more precisely , the method used to arrive at the solution , is shown but not discovered . Moreover , only one method is considered , hence the procedural knowledge remains implicit . Tim student will not even envisage other methods . He may thus know how to convert meaning into sentences  , bat this knowledge being implicit , he will not know how to transfer it to others i -tuations  . 
5, 2GUIDEDDISCOVERY
The system still controls the nature of the operations but no longer controls their order  . The latter is controlled , via stra-tegies , by the user . He decides in what order to process tlm data , Having determined the subject , whose positions is invariable , one can choose from three strategies : - a syntactic alone  ( syntactic-driven processing )  , - and two morphological ones ( le ~ i cal-ddven processing )  . 
If priority is given to syntax , no reordering of constituents is meant to take place  , i . e . all information pertaining to ~ rd order is processed  . The result is an ordered eategoriai structure or syntactical frame  ( h ) @rich will be filled in by the merpholo -gicai values determined later  ( i )  , for ex ~ lole : he gives it to her ( h ) sentence frame : Stl3~CT-DI~CTOBfCT-IN )   , 0B ~ CT-VERB ( i )   morpholo9~: illelui-donne the form is determined before U ~ e relative order of the constituent elemeats  . In this ease two strategies are possible : either one pro-e esses the director theio di  . rect object . 
The efficiency of these three strategies is of course not the same  . It is precisely the user's task to find out whidl of these strategies is tlm most efficient  . The system invites him to compare these methods by applying certain performance criteria : - oum her of steps necessary to generate the sentence  , - what is kno ~ when ? ( form/position ) , -congruence of inpet/output order ( are permutations necessary ?
LIFO/FIFO ) -are there any conceptual disruptions ? ( 9 ) This experimental method should make the student aware of the fact that several strategies can be used to arrive at the solution  . 
Ha should compare them with respect o certain cri teria and reach his conclusions  . 
5.3 USERDRI ~_NE tPERIMENTATION :
This method , like the previous one , is empirical . By playing with the system the student may gain certain insights about processing order  , A matrix appears on the screen , ~ oseblank spaces have to be filled in by the student  . The herizontal line ~ lows the syntactic information given with tim input  ( verb , subject , object , preposition ) , -more inforfmltion is needed about those elements-tlm verti-calline shows the nature of the information necessary to arrive at the output  . 
Thus the processing once again consists of tlm specification of the values of all st of attributes  . However there is a fundamental differences between this approach and tlm former  , namely , the system has an inference mechanism . Each item of information given to the system is considered for its meaning potential  , i . e . 
the system tries to fi . nd out whether some new facts can be inferred from the old fact  . 
It should be noted that the inference power varies with the nature of the data as ~ llas with their order  , lhere are eases ~ mrea single fact enables 3 other faet ~ to he deduced ( reflexives )  . 
A given inference , my allow further deductions ( inference-chain , knowledge propagation ) . This has of course an effect on Umprocess , tamely , tim greater the inference power , the greater tlmecmow of precessing . This speaks for the following operating principle : the greater the inference power of a given piece of information  , time arlier it should be processed . 
\] his method is interesting in that , by testing different items and different order ~ it makes possible to watch on the screen which items allow what inferences  . Sinee those inferences depend upon the nature of the input as ~ ellason timmoment at ~ hieh that information is given  , we believe that this module is particularly useful in helping discover the best possible order of processing  . 
Furthermore we think that this method has another virtue  , na-mely that it can simulate literally any knowledge state  , thus me-king it possible , by experimental means to diso over the shortest path bet~en a given information state  ( input ) and the solution ( output )  . 
6. O\]4 CLLSIONS :

It can happen that one cannot process all in fonmltton for a given referent  . For exa role if prtority is given to syntax it often happens that one canno too ~ oletea procedure because of a nonbedded structure  .
