AND VICE VERSA
Universally used decimal representations , such as 5 ;  200 ;  856763 ; 189 200000 are rendered ( written , pronounced ) differently in different languages . The number 5 is tllus five in English , fern in Swedish , c in q in French , ketsmalain Koyukon , biyar in Hausa and nga:in Burmese . 
Numbers can furthermore be written differently in different mathematical systems  . The number 5 is written V in the Roman system and 101 in a system with base 2   ( binary system )  . 
We will mainly be interested in the relations between the representations of the decimal system and Swedish numerals  . Numerals in some other languages , uchas English , German , French , Danish , Burmese , Hausa and Urdu will be touched upon briefly . In particular we are interested in rule systems ( algorithms ) that automatically convert mathematical representations into linguistic representations  ( numerals ) or vice versa . Our interest in this area is part of a wider interest in Automatic Text Comprehension  ,   1 which in turn is part of the areas Automat-ical Language Translation and Artificial Intelligence  . The study is focusing on problems that are due to the structure of numerals in  ( natural ) languages . The technical problems that turn up when conversion rules are to be implemented on computer are not treated in this explor-atory study  . 
The practical applications of rule systems that convert mathematical representations i to numerals or vice versa are automatic devices or robots of various types  , e . g . the " automatic stock market announcer " , the " automatic cashier " , the " automatic accountant " , the 1This work is related to the project ATC ( Automatic Text Comprehension ) f The Institute of Linguistics , University of Stockholm , which is supported by Humani-stiska Forsknings r ? t det  .

430 BENGTSIGURD " automatic telephone directory " . The automatic telephone directory would give you the number  , if you furnish the name and address of a person . The system would have to identify the person by processes that correpond to optical and manual search in a directory  . In the register of the directory the system would find the number and could pronounce it according to rules to be discussed later  . 
The automatic directory would require phonetic identification procedures that have not been developed fully yet  , at least not for large inventories of possible messages  . In societies where numbers play an increasing role-telephone numbers  , regist ratio numbers , addresses , social security numbers , bank account numbers , zip codes-systems that can identify and pronounce numbers are getting increasingly interesting  . Current experiences suggest hat any conversation with robots has to take place within heavy constraints  . 
Further examples of machines that could use the rule systems under discussion would include warning systems  , systems that read the values of meters ( temperature , altitude , humidity ) aloud . A system that reads the speed of the caraloud or tells you the distance of an approaching crossing etc  . in a mild but distinct voice might have certain advantages in difficult raffic situations  . Presently almost allwarning systems , traffic signs and signals , use optical signals . If acoustic signals are used they are not speech signals  , only rings or buzzes . The human voice and the human language may have a certain attraction to human beings  . Imagine the " speaking alarm clock " which tells you the time and reads the temperature etc  . in an attractive ( re ) male voice available as an option . 
In most of the applications mentioned so far pronunciation has been involved  . But systems of a simpler kind , which rewrite mathematical ( decimal ) number representations as numerals ( in letters ) would certainly also be useful . Banks and Post offices use numbers written both in mathematicalnd linguistic form  , presumably because of the need for redundancy and security  . This is at least the case in Sweden . It is required that a number , e . g .   1055 be written with letters as well as with figures . But these are almost our only opportunities for writing high numbers with letters  .   ( Numbers are generally written with letters only if they are below ten or belong to the round numbers  ( see B . SIGURD , 1972)) . Many person shesitate when they are to write numbers with letters  ( words )  . Swedes would for instance hesitate between ett tusenfern tio fem  , ett-tusen-femtio fem , ett(t ) usenfemtiofem , and tu-senfemt lofem . Fortunately the banks do not require any special spelling  ( only that you add Kronorafter )  . 
FROM NUMBERS TO NUME RALS AND VICE VERSA 431 There are many previou studies related to the problems under focus here  , e . g . CORSTIUS ( 1968 ) where marly general problems are treated starting from Dutch  , and C . -CH . ELERT ( 1970 ) where the morphology of Swedish numerals is treated  . We have used presentations and analyses of numerals in various languages  . But it is only for Swedish that our rules are outlined in any detail  . The other languages are treated to indicate what problems one would have to face in an automatic translation system for numerals  . A system that translates between mathematical representations and representations in Swedish  , English , French , German ( and a couple of other languages ) will be implemented on computer in the near future  . 
We will work with written forms in this study . Unfortunately it is not the case that such representations could be run through a speech synthesizer giving beautiful pronunciation  . Nor are there any speech recognition devices that can render large or infinite inventories of spoken numerals as written ones presently  . A forthcoming study by DESERVA-LEIT . ~O will shed light on the phonetic problems . Till then this examination of some of the fundamental problems may be of some importance  . Some issues of interest otheoretical linguistics will also turn up  . 
2 . MATHE MATICAL ANDLINGUIS TICRE PRESENTATIONS OF NUMBERS Representations of numbers using digits  ( figures ) will be called mathematical representations , while representations using letters ( sounds ) organized in morphemes , words and phrases as other linguistic material will be called linguistic representations  . The number 123 is now written in mathematical representation . The equivalent linguistic representation in Swedish is  ( ett ) hundrat jugotre . There are often alternativer presentations within a language  . The number 123 could thus also be rendered : ett-tv , ~- tre , to lv-tre , or ett-t jugotre . It is above all in technical contexts ( telegraphy , telephony ) that the latter types are used . The difference has to do with difference in division  . In the first ( normal ) case the whole row of digits is taken as a unit and the highest numeral  ( position word ) offered by the language ( hundra ) is used giving : ( ett ) hundra-t jugotre . In the other ( technical ) cases the series of digits is divided into smaller groups which are treated separately  . In the extreme case each digit is treated separately  . 
We will call the different divisions of the group of digits different fusion  . We can show the differences as follows : 123 ,  12 + 3 ,  1 + 23 , 432 BENGTSIGURD 1+2+3 . The first case implies total fusion , since the whole series of digits is taken into consideration  . The last case implies no fusion ; cases in between may be characterized as partial fusion  . We might call the case where the digits are treated separately spelling  , since this is the word used when a word is decomposed in letters and each letter is spoken separately  . In Swedish we could devise a new words if frering ( " digitalization " ) as an equivalent of bokstavering and stavning which mean rendering each letter by its name  . Spelling ( bokstavering ), e . g . 
rendering the word bad as be-a-de , is often used for names and other words with low redundancy  . Military forces would use special letter names with more redundancy  , in Swedish for bad : Bertil , Adam , David . 
The following is a table showing mathematical nd linguistic representations of numbers  . The linguistic representations are Swedish numerals according to different fusion  . We are mainly interested in the relations between decimal representations and linguistic ones  , but for some lower numbers binary and t ( oman representations are given . 
We will touch on the problem of pronouncing binary representations briefly  . The relations between Koman mathematical representations and Latin numerals are interesting but very complicated  , and we will not suggest any conversion rules for those representations here  .

The fundamental difference between fused and non -fused expressions is the presence of position words : - tio  ( -ton )  , hundra , tusen , million . . . 
infused forms . The etymology of such words might be far from the decimal system  . It is wellknown that there often are rival systems  , above all the 20-system ( vigesimal ) , the 12-system ( cf . duss in , gross ) and the 5-system ( quinary ) . Many ways of grouping items may seem natural . 
There are no position words associated with the positions of binary representations  , but considering the popularity of the binary system in the computerage one might suggest some  , e . g . duo ( or pair ) for position 2 ( counting from the right )  , quartet for position 3 ( 23 ) and octet for position 3 ( 28 )  . Using these position words ( group names ) the number 11 ( eleven )  , which is 1011 in binary form would be : ( one ) octet one duo one . We might alternatively construct new position words for the positions of binary numbers  . One way would be to use the decimal words rio , hundra etc . , changing them , by substituting b for the first letter , into bi(o ) , bunclra , busen , billion , billiard (') . In this system 12 ( twelve ) , which is 1100 in binary form , would be : busenbundra . Since binary representation tends to get very long  , an enormous number of position words would be needed  . We refrain from developing further binary numerals  . 
The choice of fusion form is apparently depending on the use of the number  . The number 121457 is a telephone number . Such numbers are often divided into 2-groups , but 3-groups or separate pronunciation of each figure also occurs  . It is a wellknown fact that such high telephone numbers are difficult to get through correctly  . In practice one introduces pauses at strategic points to facilitate communication  . 
We will not discuss the communicative and mnemonic advantages of different systems here  . Let us just mention that there are at least some cases  , where the totally fused numerals give shorter expressions  , e . g . enmillion compared to ett-noll-noll-noll-noll -noll-noll  . The last example with all the zeros ( noll ) is probably difficult to get through over the telephone  , since one might easily lose count . Position words have the advantage of indicating how far to the left we are  . They are in a way the equivalents of the zeros used as position fillers in mathematical representations  ( zeros do not vary according to position )  . _As is obvious from the table above there are cases where partial or no fusion gives shorter expressions than expressions based on total fusion  . It is often said that since there are infinitely many numbers and each number has a name  ( word , numeral ) in the language , there are infinitely many words in the language . If numbers can be infinitely long , words can be infinitely long too . 
Decimal fractions are rarely rendered by words , if written : three-point-fourteen looks strange , and so does the Swedish equivalent with komma instead of point : tre-komma-fj or to n  . The figures after the decimal point ( komma ) are generally given separately , in particular , if there is a long row of decimal figures . For instance , if the value of pi is to be given by more than 2 decimals one turns to separate pronunciation of the figures immediately : compare  3  , 14 and 3 , 14159 . For practical purposes it seems the rule that figures after the decimal point  ( komma ) are pronounced without fusion is sufficient , and we will not discuss the matter further . 
The year 1718 is pronounced sjutton hundraart on not ett usens juhun-draarton  ( just as in English )  . We will say that total fusion is applied , but not maximum fusion , since the maximum position word ( tusen ) offered by the language is not used . In Swedish the normal way of pro--nouncing 1066 would be ( ett ) tusen-sextiosex , but tio hundrasextiosex might be heard ( equivalent to the English ten sixty-six except for the lack of position word in English  )  . Non-maximum fusion is only allowed in ( 1000 ) 1100-1900 . The year 2000 is pronounced rtvdt usen ( not t jugo hundra )  . The year 2384 is naturally render dast vdt usent rehund radt tio fyr a  . 
The reason for not allowing non-maximum fusion above  19 has to do with a concept of " primary " numerals . The primary numerals in Swedish ( as in many other languages ) include ( words for )  19 , the base number 10 , 1119 ( the-teens , in Swedish :- tontalen : the first two are irregular in Swedish as in all the other Germanic languages  ; further details below ) . 
The pronunciation of dates is paralleled by the pronunciation of prices  . A price , e . g . 1900 may be rendered as nitton-hundra ( nineteen hundred ) or ett use nio hundra ( one thousand and and nine hundred )  . The price 2300 ( Kronor ) may only be pronounced as tv8tusent rehundra ( not t jugot rehundra )  . There is , however , an interesting alternative way of pronouncing prices  . 2300 could be given as tvd-och-tre , 1900 could be given a sett-och-nio . A ( used ) car could thus have the price 1300 , which may be rendered a stretton hundra , ett(t ) usentre hundra orett-och-tre . The contexts ( or hidden units ) are important . The expression tvd-och-tre could perhaps mean the same as tvd millioner trehund ratusen  ( 2300000 ) kronor , ( tvd-komma-tremillioner ) , but not 230 kronor , nor 23 kronor . 
It might meant vd kronorochtrei ~ re(2 , 03 kronor ) . But ambiguities of this sort are rare in practice  . In order to avoid ambiguity one might FROM NUMBERS TO NUMERAL SAND VICE VERSA  435 pronounce the zero in such cases : tvd-octl-nolt - tre  ( with stress on nol O . 
Fortunately most prices of the type under discussion are unambiguous  , e . g . tvd-och-tio(2,10), sext on-och-sjuttiofem(16,75) . 
Numbers play an extremely important r61e in modern society . As the set of numbers often is restrictedue to context  , function etc . reduced ways of expression , or sublanguages , develop . A certain row of figures or numerals may be completely unambiguous among used cardealers  , although it is ambiguous from the point of view of the total language  , or means something different in another sublanguage  . Detailed studies of the use of figures and numerals in different functions  , contests and surroundings would certainly be rewarding  . 
3. FROM MATHE MATICALINTOS WEDISH RES ENTATION.
GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS
Separate pronunciation of each figure is no great problem  , and we will concentrate on total fusion in the following  . We begin by presen- . ting the following table where position numbers and position words associated with positions are to be found  . The term position word , of course , reflects our looking at the numerals from the point of view of the decimal positional representations  . The words could also be called group names or number measures  . For reasons of space we have not included any position word higher than milliard  . 
example : 666
Position number 10   9   8   7   6   5   4   3   2   1   6a6261 position value 10g   10 s 10 v 106   105   104   108   102   101   100=   1   6  . 103 +6 . 101 + 6 . 1 0 oposition word mill-mill-tu-hun-tio/ sexhundrasex-lardions endra-tontiosex There is no position word for unit in Swedish  . One might uses tycken ( pieces , units ) , but presumably since position word for units is redundant i is generally left out  . As a name for the whole set S we desu seen tal , but it is not possible to use en in the numerals , perhaps because enlacks plural . There is no point in stating that en is therein the underlying form but obligatorily deleted  .   ( The numerale n could then be derived by deleting the numeral enbefore the position worden  , which is an optional rule in many cases : ( ett ) tusen , ( ett ) hundra . But this seems unnatural sophistication . )  436 BENGTSIGURD The steps between the higher position words are  108   ( 1000 )  . We will see examples of languages with different steps later  , such as Urdu . 
The only genuine position words are the first three  . They are also Germanic , but they have not always been associated with the decimal system as is done now  . Many Swedes would hesitate , when it comes to position words higher than million  . Some might also have a feeling that languages use milliard  , billion etc . differendy ( which is also the case ) . 
The number 666 is represented in three different ways above . Let us call the normal decimal representation : positional decimal  , or just decimal as usual . The representation 6 . 10 ~ + 6 . 101 + 6 . 100 may be called : analytic decimal , or just analytic representation , since it analyzes the number into the terms to be added  . The terms do not have to be in a certain order or take certain positions  . The representations exhun-drasextiosex is called ( fused ) linguistic representation as before . 
Our purpose is to derive linguistic representations from decimal ones but the relations between the analytic  ( decimal ) representation and the linguistic one are also of interest  . We will compare generative grammars for the differentypes of representations briefly  . 
Decimal representations , the input or output of our conversion rul-es , may be generated by the following simple generative rules  , where N is the number , disdigit . The number of digits in the strings ( n ) may be infinite . 
(1) N-d(d ) ( d ) ...
d ~ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0
If number such as 000 and 007 are not to be permitted , we have to state that the first d must be #0 . 
The analytic decimal representations may be generated by the following rules  , where ( a ) and ( b ) are variants with different order . 
(2) N~d---~ld . 10 q-d . 101-I-d . 10L, . d . 10'~( a ) d . 10" . . . + d . 10 ~+ d . 101+d . 10 ?( b ) 1 , 2  , 3  , 4  , 5  , 6  , 7  , 8  , 9  , 0 The b-variant can easily be derived from the decimal representation by inserting powers of  10 according to position umber . We might perhaps consider the b-variant as a semantic interpretation f the decimal representation  . Rules converting decimal representations i to analytic ones would then seem related to the interpretative rules suggested FROMNUMBERSTO NUMERAES AND VICE VERSA  437 in transformational grammar . The analytic representations would be the readings or the meaning of the decimal expressions  . 
The " generative semantics " approach would then be to start from the analytic expressions and derive the normal decimal expressions  . 
This can be done by deleting the powers of 10 from the b-variant , where the order then carries the information about the powers  . The a-variant gives the units first and has to be reversed by a transformation in order to fit the standar decimal representation  . Changing the de-cimal representation by mentioning units first would have some advantages in communication-presently the listener does not know anything about positions if numbers are given by pronouncing each digit separately as observed by C  . -CH . ErERT (1970) . Note , however , that the units are given first ( in the leftmost place ) in many languages in the teens ( to ntalen )  , and in some language seveal in higher numbers , e . g . 
German : ein-und-z wanzig.
It is , of course , easy to generalize the rules ( 2 ) to cover systems with any base and any arrangement of the terms  . 
Rules for Swedish numerals have been suggested in C  . -CH . ELERT (1970) . They are , however , too surface oriented for our purposes . We need " deep structure " rules for the numerals which are as close as possible to the decimal representations  . Let us first suggest the following rules , covering numbers as great as millions . 
N -+ ( dmillion )   ( dkundratusen )   ( dtiot usen )   ( dtusen )   ( dhundra )   ( d t i o )   ( d ) d--~en , tvd , tre , fyra , fern , sex , sju , dtta , nioThe coverage of the first rule can be increased by adding brackets with the proper content or by introducing recursion  ( e . g . N instead of d before millioner ) substitution rules , such as tusen millioner ~ milliard , tusen milliar cler -+ billion ( etc . ) . In order to derive surface structures from such deep representations we need the following main types of rules  . 
1) Morphophone mic rules , which changes jutio into sjuttio , fyraint of j or before to n(f jorton ) etc . 
2 ) Reordering rules which change the order between units and tens in the teens  ( to ntalen )  . Our deep structure would generatentiofy ra for 14  , which has to be changed int of jort on with the units before to n  , the representative of rio . ( theen is deleted according to 3 . ) 438 BEN'GT SIGURD3) Deletion rules , which obligatorily deleteen before t to and optionally deleteet t before hundra and t usen  . We have used the compound position words : tiot usen  , hundratusen , for positions 5 ,  6 . Since the tusen only occurs in those compounds if there is no other t usen to the right in the string we must deletet usen in other cases  . 
4) Concord rules , which give the plural millioner etc . at proper places and the neuter formett before neuter nouns such as hundra and barn " child "  . 
It is possible to improve the deep structure rules suggested in various ways  . Arguments could also be found in the pronunciation and orthographic rendering of the numerals  . The following rules are established with such arguments in view  . 

N ~ ( Gmillion ) ( Gtusen ) ( G)
G-~(dhundra ) ( drio)(d)d~en , tvd , tre , fyra , fern , sex , sju , dtta , nio In this approach hundreds , tens and units are treated as a group ( constituent ) which may occur alone , before t usen , million ( er ) , mil-liard(er ) etc . The difference between rules ( 3a ) and ( 3b ) is perhaps best shown by the tree diagrams for an example  , such as sexmillioners exhund rasex riosex tusens exhund rasextiosex  ( Fig .  1) . 
The following arguments support analysis according to  3b   ( cf . also
C.-CH . EI . ~ RT , 1970).
1 ) Position words are spaced by 103 in Swedish ( not necessarily in all languages ) and for positions in between the fundamental group position words  ( hun & a , tio ) are used . 
2 ) It corresponds to the division into 3-groups often made in decimal representations ( 666 666 666 )  . MS we dish space is used ; in English comma is available for the task , since point is used in decimal fractions . 
3 ) Although the phonetic details are by no means clear  , it seems the proper rules can be formulated easily within this framework  . The main rule seems to be the following : The last  ( rightmost ) d ( simple number ) within the group ( (3 ) is always given the main stress . The others in the group are reduced accordingly . The G could perhaps best be treated as an attributive  ( Adjective Determiner ) within an NP . The N within the NPistusen , millioner , etc .   ( As observed above a head for the last group is lacking  . ) In high numbers everal NP's are coordinat-FROM NUMBERS TO NUMERAL SAND VICE VERSA  439   ( 3a )

ed . The constituents within G may also be considered as coordinated NP's  . Some languages how the conjunction ( and ) between certain NP's . The phonetic properties of numerals will be treated in greater detail in a study by Dr Sr RPA -LErr  . ~ o ( to appear) . 
4 ) The orthographic conventions for numerals are by no means clear  . The parts rio/t on are treated ( phonologically ) as suffixes and always joined with the preceding number  . The units are similarly joined with a preceding term rio  ( sextiosex )  , perhaps also with preceding hundra ( sexhund rasex )  . As for higher terms it is hard to know : cases are difficult to come by  .   ( Sexmillioner sexorsex millioner sex ? ) The simple numeral 440 BENGTSIGURD before hundra ( the coefficient ) may or may not be joined with hundra ( sex hundra ors exhundra )  . The tens may or may not be joined with the preceding position word : sexhundrasextio or sexhundrasextio  . In brief , the situation is unclear and detailed studies of usage are needed  . Handbooks are conspicuously silent . 
Many persons probably join all numerals and write them as one long word as a radical solution in this situation  . If conventions are to be introduced , they could easily be formulated within the tree structure suggested by  ( 3b )  . A simple rule would be the following : join all words within the group G  , but no other elements . This rule would introduce spaces where there are deep branchings in the tree  . We would get the following division for our example : sexmi Uioners exhundrasextio sext usen sexhundrasextiosex  . But it is possible to formulate other conventions if desired  . Some languages use the hyphen ( -- ) between certain constituents , as we will see . 
The relations between analytic representations and the deep structures described by rules  3a and 3b are fairly simple . Conversion rules operating on analytic representations would have to replace the powers of  10 by proper position words , replace the digits by proper simple numerals etc . Taking the non-analytic decimal representation as input to conversion rules  , implies inserting the proper position words , but except for that there is litded ifference , We will now focus our interest on automatic on version schemes  . 
4 . CONVERSION RULES CHANGING MATHE MATICALIN TO SWEDISH 

We are now ready to test conversion rules written as generative rules or instructions of different kinds  . We will discuss alternative solutions at some points  . We distinguish between two blocks of rules : I ) fusion rules , which insert position words and introduce syntactic structure  ; II ) lexical rules , which substitute words ( simple numerals ) for fi-gures ( digits )  . 
Ia ) Fusion rules.
Count number of digits in decimal representation a dmark positions  . 
The ( maximum ) number of positions ( digits ) is determined by the position of the leftmost digit which is not zero  ( ~  ( 3 )  .

Apply the rules until all groups of digits have been dissolved  ( interspersed by position words )  . Determine positions a new for each group of digits .

Normally the maximum position word is inserted , but as mention-ed before prices and years may be different  , if between 1100-1999 , which is taken into account in the rules . Instead of recursive application of the rules , compound position words such as tiot usen , hundrat usen could be inserted ( under certain conditions )  . 
As an alternative we might use the following procedure  , which has some advantages when rules of pronunciation and rules for separating and combining numerals are to be formulated  . It is based on deep structure rules 3b ( above ) which assumes the division of high numbers into 3-groups   ( in Swedish often marked by space already )  .

As observed before , the element stio/t on are always joined with the preceding number and treated as suffixes  ( -tonnumbers take the grave accent )  . This phenomenon is related to the lengthening of tinrio/ton  ( sjutton , sjuttio , nitton etc . ) . We have treated this as allomorphic hoice ( not by phonological rules ) assuming allomorphs of tre , sju , nioending in t . In a traditional generative grammar ( meeting demands of eco-nomy and simplicity ) the doubling of t should be handled by the same rule  ( dental gemination ) that gives bott from bo+t ( participle of bo ) and bldtt from bld+t ( neuter of bld )  . We have introduced+rio and+ton in our rules with the plus to be used  ( as internal juncture ) for special purposes . There might be better ways of handling the situation  ; it is depending on how pronunciation and orthographic conventions are to be handled  . We have some use of the plus sign , but have to delete it in some cases . In the rule that deletes en ( ett ) beforerio ( to avoid the impossible tt-tio ) we also delete the plus sign . This gives the result-ant tio the right status , and it is not treated as a suffix in e . g . hundratio . 
Notice that the ointio can only be deleted ( optionally ) in the suffix tio ( femti ( o )  , sjutti(o )) , not in case such as hund ratio where tio is stressed  . 
The fusion rules do what human beings do when they face a string of digits  . System(Ia ) corresponds roughly to a procedure , where the person counts the number of digits to get an idea how many tens  , hundreds , thousands , ten thousands , hundred thousands , millions etc . are in the number , the order of magnitude . Fusion rules Ib correspond to what is done by a person who divides the string of digits into  3-groups   ( if this is not done already )  , counts the number of 3-groups to find out whether the number is in the thousands  , millions , milliards etc . Estimation of numerous ness i easily handled in a glimpse if the number is five or less  . Longer strings need counting . Division into groups of three digits is a practical method  , which facilitates determination of the size of the number  ( see B . SICURD , 1972) . 
444 BENGT SIGURD 5 , FROMS WEDISHIN TO MATHE MATICAL REPRESENTATIONL et us now outline a system which is the reverse of the previous conversion system  . Again we distinguish between two blocks of rules : I  ) lexical rules which identify numerals and substitute digits for them  ; II ) fusion rules which identify the position words tusen  , hundra etc . ; delete these words using their information for placing the digits in proper positions  . 
We might call these rules positioning rules . In additiona zero insertion rule is needed . Zeros must be inserted at all empty places in the decimal representation  . We will apply the lexical rules first , but the reversed order or mixed order may have advantages  .

Decimal representations could be considered as an interlingua in an automatic translation system between several anguages  . Translation between two related languages , uchas Swedish and English ( or all the Germanic languages ) could be handled without using decimal representations  , since word-for-word translation ( and a few additional rules ) would suffice . This will be obvious from the following examination  , but we will not discussuch conversion rules for pairs of natural languages  .

In Swedish the elements tio ( alone ) , ti(o ) in e . g . femtio and to nine . g . femt on are assumed to be manifestations of the same position  ( word )  . Intuitively most S we descertainly associate the first two  ( tio and-ti ( o ) ) . In English the manifestation sten and-teen seem the closest  . 
English has a hyphen between units and preceding tens  ( twentyfive ; twenty-one thousand ) . This may be handled by inserting a hyphen before units  ( the last position ) in 3-groups , if tens are preceding . Similarly and must be inserted before tensor units preceded by htm dreds  , thousands etc .   ( 2 50630: two hundred and fifty thousand six hundred and thirty  )  . 
Notice that one/a before hundred , thousand and higher words must not be deleted in English  . We refrain from giving any rules for the choice between one and a  . 
English is known to have special habits in telephone numbers  , e . g . 
the use of o ( ou ) for zero and double x as in : five ou double one for  5011  . 
Such idiosyncrasies must be taken into account when constructing automatic recognition systems  .

German shows perfect similarity between the number for  10 and the suffix in the teens ( zehn )  . There is little allomorphic variation . We note the exceptions for 11,12 . We take zwan as an allomorph of zwei , just as we took twen as an allomorph of two in English  . One might go further and consider zw8 in German , twe in English to in Swedish as allo-448 BENGTSIGURD morphs in zwb'If , twelve , tolv respectively . If soe/f , eleven , elva may be analyzed to contain a variant of the word for  1 and something like-l ( e ) v - , This is etymologically correct ( the last root being related to Swedishlgimna , English leave ) . But both intuitively and technically this seems unnecessary  . 
The conjunction undisobligatory in German between units and tens  ( the units preceding the tens )  , optional between hundreds and lower terms . The unit word e in may optionally be deleted beforehundert and tausend  . It is easy to imagine the rules for German and we refrain from giving further details  .

A connective t is used , but only before unafter the numerals for : 20 ,  30 ,  40 ,  50 ,  60 ,  70 . 
French has a morpheme antefortens , but certain features must be associated with a vigesimal system  . In the numbers for 1116 one might distinguish a morpheme ze , which is in fact etymologically related to dix ( E . Bouacmz , 1950, p .  68) . French has thus three completely different manifestations of the position element for ten : ante  , ze , dix , distributed somewhat irregularly . 
We give an outline of the conversion rules for French  .

In languages where the numerals are based on a different non-decimal system  , such as the vigesimal or quinary , one might use a kind of adaptive rules between the decimal and the vigesimal  , quinary etc . representations , which are suitable as underlying forms for the numerals  . Since French only shows some fragments of a different system this is hardly necessary for French  . The first block of rules within the lexical block can take care of irregularities  . These rules apply to more than one item .

Example 1 + ti 4~4 + ten ( ~ fjorten ) 2 + ti7~7og2q-ti ( -+ syvogtyve ) It is tempting i : o do something more insightful to catch the vigesimal character of the later Danish numerals  . Such rules should include the following facts . For 50 ,  60 ,  70 ,  80 ,  90  ( y ) the number of multiples of 20 ( x ) is determined , using the simple equation (4) y = x . 20 . 
The resulting value of x is rendered by the usual numerals  ( with ~ some minor morphophonemic changes )  , unless it is a fraction , such as 2 . 5, 3 . 5, 4 . 5 . A fraction such as 2 . 5 is not rendered by to ( ogen ) halv , but by halvtre . If z is the value before halv we can apply the following rule  ( 5 ) zhalv ~ halv ( z + 1 ) This rule is also used e . g . in telling the time in Swedish . Instead of tvdochenhalv Swedesay halvtre , when it is half past two . What the rule does is to change an additive representation into a subtractive  . 
FROM NUMBERS TO NUME RALS AND VICE VERSA 451 The multiplication sign is rendered by sinds in the Danish numerals and special reduction rules apply to give the short forms  . Fortunately new numerals ( more like the Swedish ) are catching on in Denmark .

Burmes enumerals are well adapted to the decimal system  . Restric-ted knowledge in Burmese makes us hesitate but Burmes enumerals seem very simple  . They look almost as if they were constructed at the writing-table  . The morphological nalys is of the words is evident  , there are no exceptions , uchasourelva and tolv . The morphemes for 1 and 2 have morphophonemic variation ( special forms for compounding )  , but except for that there is little morphophonemic variation  . 
The correspondences are direct , and conversion rules should be simple to write . We will only make some further comments . 
Burmese seems to have ( unanalysable , non-compound ) position words for high numbers , uchas : 10000 ,  100 000 ,  1 000 000 , 10000000 ( unless we are mistaken) . Burmese also seems to have a word for unit : hku . In Burmese the unit before 10 in the expression for 10 may option-452 BBNGT $1GURD ally be deleted . We have noted the obligatory deletion of 1 before 10 in several languages and the optional deletion of  1 before 100  , 1000 in some languages . Burmese uses hsefor+ty as well as + teen ( and ten )  . 
This has the effect that some words , such as the words for 18 and 80 are minimal pairs : hse . hyi (18): hyihse (80) , at least from a segmental point of view . We do not have such minimal pairs in Swedish because  10 is represented by to n after the units in the teens  , and by ti ( o ) before the units in the other cases . We note that traditional morphemic analysis cannot reasonably treat on and ti  ( o ) as allomorphs in Swedish , since they contrast as infemtio:femton(cf . C . -CI ~ . Er ~ RT , 1970, p .  154) .

The morpheme for 10 ( goma ) may optionally appear in the teens . If it is deleted , it seems ha would have to take its place and be considered as a variant  ( manifestation ) of 10 . We cannot identify any simple numerals in the words for  20  , 30 etc . We might take in as a representative of 10 , but the rest has to be treated as a supple tive allomorph of  2  ,  3 , 4 etc . We note that the mul-tiplier ( coc fi % ic nt ) is placed after its position word in number such as  2000  ,  100 000 .   ( Do attributives follow their heads in Hausa ? ) Note that , as a consequence , the only difference between the words for 100000 and 1100 is the word da . Our knowledge of Hausa is restricted and we will not procede any further in this analysis  .

Rules for Urdu would have to take much morphophonemic variation into account  . A morpheme is occurs in 20 ,  30 , 40 and a teen morphemer8 cana/so be attested , but there are many exceptions . 
The units go before the morpheme for 10 in the teens and in 21  , 22 etc . , but the elements seem merged . We note the existence of position words for high number spaced  102   , not 103 as in Swedish and English . 
7 . CONCLUSION ? After this brief survey of numerical systems  , we can state that conversion between different representations does not cause great problems  . 
We have mainly worked on written forms and disregarded the phonological problems  . Solving the problems in connection with conversion between spoken numerals and decimal representations is very important One might even accept ad hoc solutions  , e . g . using prerecorded position words and primary numerals  , which are combined according to the rules indicated above-a synthesis based on " prefab " elements  . 
454 BENGTSIGURD
We might sum up the problems we have faced when writing conversion rules as follows :  1  ) The fit to decimal representation is rarely as good as in Burmese  . Deviations concern the use of other base numbers ( 5 ,  20 , 12) and different order . Special adaption rules may be used in such cases . 
2 ) The order between multiplier ( coefficient ) and position words varies ( as does the order between attributive and head in noun phrases  )  . 
In Hausa 5000 is ( the equivalent of ) thousand five , while European languages have ( the equivalent of ) five thousand . The order between units , tens , hundreds , thousands , millions etc . only varies between units and tens . Many languages have the units first in the teens , some have the units first in all the tens . 
3 ) Languages rarely have exactly the same element in the word for  10  , the teens and the " ties " . The variation is clearly useful and may have a functional explanation  , as well as a historical . In Swedish the words for 15 ( femt on ) and 50 ( femtio ) would have coincided , if 10 was manifested in the same way in both numbers . The complication only occurs if units are preposed as in Swedish  . 
4 ) There are clear tendencies to delete redundant material in the sublanguage that numerals constitute  . The words for 1 and unit are often deleted , but conventions vary between languages . 
5 ) Beside position words and fundamental numerals ome languages use additive  ( or subtractive ) morphemes and morphemes meaning multiplication ( " times " )  . But most languages rely heavily on order arrangements  , which are very economic . 
6 ) Sporadic occurrences of fractions have been attested  , e . g . in Danish . Such cases need special treatment . If they are isolated , lexical rules may take care of the matter without any insightful  ( and etymolo-gically suggestive ) rules , at least for practical purposes . 
7 ) The conventions for joining numerical morphemes vary very much between languages and so does the use of hyphen  . The rules can probably always be explained on the basis of  ( assumed ) constituent structure . 
8 ) The pronunciation of numerals above all long numerals can presumably be predicted on the basis of segmental structure and tree structure  . We have not investigated this area in any detail , however .
