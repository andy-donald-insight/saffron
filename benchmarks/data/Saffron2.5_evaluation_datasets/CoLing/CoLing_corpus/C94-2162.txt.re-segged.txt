This paper describes how recent linguistic results in explaining Japanese short and long distance scramhling  ( : an be directly incorporated into an existing principles-and-parameters-based prser with only triviM modifications  . '\[' he fact that this is realizable on a parser originally designed for a fixed-word-order language  , together with the fact thai ; Japanese scrambling is complex , attests to the high degree of crosslinguistic generalization present in the theory  . 
1 Introduction l ) uring the past several years , the phenomenon kown as " sermnbling " has become a topic of some interest  ; it is of particular importance in languages like Get'-man  , Japanese , Korean and tlindiamong others , its opposed to fixed-word-order languages like English  . 
Scrambling can pose both sever (' , linguistic and cornpu-rational ditficulties for natur M language parsers  . This paper describes how these problems are dealt within a Principles-and-I  ) a ran3eters-based prser . Japanese , at first glance , seems to permit fMrly-free permutation of objects  :   ( I ) Short distance ( Vl '- internal ) scrambling Ca ) ao hn-ga Mary-n!ko no hon-oa get a ( ko to ) t

(1990 ) augmen the '\ [? ee Adjoining Grammar ( TAG ) sys-tent using either : ( 1 ) multicomponent ( set-based ) adjunct ! on ( Me-TAG )  , or (9) relaxed linear precedence ( FO-TAG ) , I ~ oh and lesocalled " long distance " scrambling in German  ( that is , scrambling over clausal boundaries ) .   2 This augmentation aims to directly repair the lackoff pernmtation in ordinary TAGs by adding a mechanism that can  ( over ) generate many different scramblings , l lowever , as so often happens , when one turns to a richer sel ; of exmnples in other languages , or the interaction of scrambling with other phenomena such as anaphor binding and weak cross over  , things are not as simple as they appear and the straightforward solution breaks clown  . 
An altogether different appro ~ chist~ken in this paper  . The goM is to produce an an Mysis of scrambling that works for different languages and a wider variety of examples wilh ou ! introducing new machinery  . The essential idea is to rely on the same ( universal ) constraints and parsing algorithms Mready in place for non-scramhling languages  , e . g . English . \[ nother words , we adopt the null hypothesis . So , we begin with a com Imtationally-r node lh : d linguistic framework that is already capable of handling scrambling as the dedm-tive result of interactions of basic principles  , such as general movement ( Move-c0 with Binding theory . The point is that scrambling ( like the socalled i as mv ; and " dative " constructions ) obeys the same i : estriction sah ' eady show u to be operative for other syntactic phenomena  , and so shoukl follow from in 1 ( Salt , o , 1992) remarks that ko to % he fact . that ' is often added to avoid the unuagurahless resulting fl ' om not having a topic in the main ' ix clause  . 
2It was broughtt , olny attention by Doug Jones ( person M coinmunl cation )   , lhat German is normally considered to have only short  , distances crambling for technical reasons . We will not explore this here , but note that none of die examples lu'e-sented in  ( l-lecker et ah ,  1990 ) in wJve " scramblillg " out of tensed clauses .

2.2 Scrambling and Binding
Our goal in this and the following sections is to reinterpret the data in terms of the implemented theory outlined above  , and see how far we get . Wc will point out any oddities and problems along tile way  . All examples are taken From ( Saito ,  1985 ) and have been verified to work on the parser unless otherwise stated  . 
(4 )   ( a ) * Kare<ga Mary-ga 3ohn<ni okuttategami-oma dayon deinai ( ko to ) s ( b ) Mau:y-ga , Iohnl-niokuttategami-okarei-ga madayon de in ai  ( ko to ) rl ' he letter i ; llat Mary sent to John , he has not yet read it ( c ) * ?

( 4a ) is strMghtforwardly ruled out by Condition C of the Binding theory since  5As is conventional , sul ) scrlpt indices will be used to mark coreference possibilities  . Roughly speaking , if two NPs have identical indices , then are said to denot , e the same object/person . 
kate binds John . (4c ) and (4d ) flora ( Saito , 1992) are also handled by Binding theory . In ( 4c ) ol agai is unbound which violates Condition A ( all anaphors have to be A-bound )  . In ( 4d ) it is A-bound since we have assumed scrambling to A-positions  . Ilence , these data . involving tiles crambling of anaphors and pronouns constitutes evidence that scrambled elements obey the usual principh  ; s . 
2.3 Scrambling and Weak Cross over
Weak Cross over ( WCO ) effects are a wellknown phenomenon in English . For example: ( 5 )   ( a ) Who i love shis in \] other ( b ) * Who/doeshisim other loveti ( 5a ) can be interpreted as a skingtile question for which  . person a :, x loves x's mother . Crucially ,   ( 51 ) ) cannot be interpreted as asking the question : for ' which  , person x , x ' s ? no/her loves x . In the parser , the unavailability of ( Sb ) is explained by an LF principle , Ileanalyze Pro-l ; ' orms , which rean Myzes as variables those pro-rorms ( e . g . pronouns ) hound by an operator in tmA-position , as suggested by the above logical analysis . \ [ iowever , this fails when the pro-fbrm inter-venes between the operator mid its trace  , as is the case in ( Sh ) .

Figure 2: Examples of vacuons crambling
The problem that arises is that the parser produces extra parses not eliminated by the existing principles  , involving vacuous crambling of the form shown in fig-tire  2  . 
Let us define the obvious notion of " non-vacuous " or visible scrambling as scrambling that " passes over " one or more overt elements at S -strncture  . Adopting this definition immediately eliminates cases  ( a )   ( c )  , and more importantly , the repeated application of case ( a ) which causes parsing non-termination , laInpar-titular , this rules out vacnons scrambling over empty subjects  , e . g . proor PRO . As farthe data from ( Saito ,  1985) , (1992) and (' I'ada , 1993) goes , this is no restriction at all . This leaves case ( d ) which is vacuous only when considered as a " pair  "  , i . e . each sub-instance is clearly non-vacuous . 
We will make use of the following assumptions : 1 . Scrambling is always to the left . 
2. Empty NPs don't scramble.
Again , judging from the data , these appear to be no restriction all . Now , it , is simple to implement he non-vacuity ( NV ) constraint as a licensing condition on phrasal adjunction : 
IPi--+s NP , IPi(x ), NV(x)
VP ; ~ sNP , VP i(x ) , NV(z ) ltere , we assume that there are two phrasMadjnnc-tion rules  , for IP at td VP , that introduces crambled NPs ( sNPs ) . 14 Here , NV ( x ) is a semantic aelion which checks the frontier of x  , the tP or VP phrase , for non-vacuity using the following left-to -right  , two state machine : State 0: ( Start ) See an overt node , go to State 1 . 
State 1: ( End ) Ski puntil see an NP gap , halt.
Note this is potentially inefficient since the NV constraint is only checked when the LtU machine completes the RHS of a rule  , i . e . when it completes an IP or VP phrase . By operating at the lew ~ l of the terminal string , instead of waiting for the complete IP or VP , la Note that the string w't cuous empty operator movements how I lin  ( C ) do ( Is not count as an instance of scrambling . It's not adjunction at VP or\[P . 
14 The tricky case of ( d ) shown earlier can be handled hyre strictings NP to overt NPs only  . 
we (: an take advantage of the fact ; that scrambling is always to tile left to implement the non-vacuity check in ~ strictly left-to-right fashion  . As before , when we see a potentially scrambled NP , we start the two state machine . Ilere , the basic idea is that a shift action ( read a term in M ) corresponds to the state 0 to state 1 transition . Similarly , a NP-~ , ~ reduce action corresponds to the " see an NP gap and halt " part  . Con , -paring the two algorithms on 50 Japanese sentences ( 25 scrambling examples ) fi'om ( Saito , 1985) & ( Lasnik & Saito ,  1984) , an average speedup factor of 2 . 3 per sentence and a total of 3 . 2 over the 50 sentences was observed for the second algorithm over just the phrase structure recovery portion  . Due to the varying effects from the participation of other principh '  . s , the improvement for the total parsing time was le . ssclear cut , generally varying between ospeed up at all l ; o a factor of two depending on the sentence . Using the 25 non-scrambling examples fl'om the test set , an additional experiment hetween two variants of the parser  , one with and one without the ability to handle scrambling  , showed that the ability to handles crambling ex -acts a penalty of about  30   50% in total parsing time , In conclusion , given tit ( ; pertlaps disproportion at eel'-feet of scrambling on parsing time  , we suggest that although scrambling comes virtually for free linguistically speaking  , the same certainly does not N ) pear to be the case for computation .
