This paper presents Trace & Unification Grammar ( TUG )  , a declarative and reversible grammar formalism that brings together Unification Grammar  ( UG ) and ideas of Government & Binding Theory ( on ) ~ The main part of the paper consists in a description of many free word order phenomena of German syntax  . It will be shown that the use of traces allows for an easier and more elegant way of description than competing approaches like ID/LP-format rules as used e  . g . in GPSG and HPSG . Grammk rs written in the TUG-formalls m can be compiled to a very efficient parser  . The occurrence of head movement , wh-movement and scrambling in one sentence does not lead to any decrease in parsing efficiency  . 
1 Introduction
The basic motivation in creating TUG formalism was to capture the empiric knowledge that represents the outcome of at least  15 years ' linguistic discussion of German word order  , while maintaining the efficiency that is required from a grammar formalism of today's standard  . With reference to the basic work of \[ Len77\] on marked and unmarked word order linguists in the generative tradition such as \[  Thi82\]  , \[ dB84\] ,  \[  Fau87\] and \[ Cze87\] revealed an impreesive list of descriptive phenomena that can be appropriately handled by the assumption of sconflgurational  , i . e . VP containing description of German word order . Among these phenomena countasy metries in the serialization behaviour of nominatively marked NPs in passive and the socalled " psych " constructio * m *  , the account for scrambling phenomena in Acl / ECM Constructions  2 and the observations of \[ Cze87\] wrt . to the voices of double accusative verbs in German  . What all these works intend is to pronounce the danger a description of German is likely to run iuto  , that " draws immediate conclusions as to the surface position of argumet  , tNPH on the basis of their surface cases " ( \[dB84\]:59 )  .

Besides this basis , the main features of TUG are feature typing , mixing of attribute-value-pair and ( PROLOG- ) tern runilication , flexible macros , unre~stricted disjunction attd special rule type ~ for argument and head movement  ,  2 . 1 Bas ic ru le types As a very simple example we will look at the TUG version of the example grammar in  Shi84\] z .

The two main differences to PATRII in the basic fram work are that first  , TUGi ~ less flexible in that it has a " hard " contextfree backbone  , whereas in PArRl I categories of the context frcc part are placeholders for feature structures  , their names beeing taken as the value of the cat feature in the structure  . Second , TUG has a strict typing . For a feature path to be well defined , each of its attributes has to be declared in tile type definition  .

Two main types of movement are distinguished : argument movement and head movement  . The format and processing of argument movement rules is greatly inspired by \[  CLW88\] and \[ Che90\]  , the processing of head movement is based on GPSG like slash features  . 
2.2.1 Head Movement
A head movement rule defines a relation between two positions in a parse tree  , one is the landing site , the other the trace position . It ead movement is constrained by the condition that the trace is the head of a specified sister  ( the root node ) of the landing site4 . 
Trace and antecedent are identical with the exception that the landing site contains over t material  , the trace does'nt . 
To formulate head movement in TUG the following format is used  . First , a head definition defines which category is the head of which other  , e . g . for the V-projection line of the above grammar : v is_head_of vp  . 
vp is_head of s.
Second , the landing site is defined by a rule likes '-- -> v+sI  .   .   . 
where landing site and root node are linked by a + . 
To inclnde recursive rules in the head path , heads are defined by the following head definitions  . In a structure \[ ~\ [ D1 .   .   . D , \] Di is the headell ( if either Di is_head_of M is defined or Di has the same category as Mandeitt * erD ~ is_head_of X or X is_head_of Di is defined for any category X  . 
2.2.2 Argument Movement
Argument moven mnt rules describe a relation between a landing site and a trace  . The trace is always e-commanded by the landing site  , its antecedent . 
Two different traces are distinguished , anaphoric traces and variable traces . Anaphoric traces must find their antecedent within the same bounding node  , variable trace binding is constrained by sut ~ jaceney  , c . a . the binding of timtrace to its antecedent must not cross two bounding nodes  . Anaphoric traces are found for example in English passive constructions\[s\[npTim book of this author \] i was read t ~\] w be reasvariable traces are usually found in wh-constructions and topicalization  . Similar to the proposal in \[ CLW88\] , argument movement is coded in TUG by a rule that describestim landing site  , as for example in 4Iere , " head of " is a transitive relation ~ . t . if x is head of y and y is head of z then x is head of z  . 
s2---> np : ant e < trace(var , np : trace ) , slIante:fx = traee:fx , This rule states that rip : ante 5 is tile antecedent of an np-trace that is dominated by sl  . 
The first argument in the trace-term indicates whether the landing site is for a variable  ( vat ) or for an anaphoric ( aaa ) trace . Other than head movement , where trace and antecedent are by definition identical  , the feature sharing of argument traces with their antecedents has to be defined in the grammar by feature quations  ( ante:fx = trace:fx ,   .   .   . ) . Furthermore , it is not necessary that the antecedent and the trace have the same syntactic ategory  . 
The current version of the formalisms requires that the grammar contains a declaration on which categories are possible traces  . In such a declaration it is possible to assign features to a trace  , for example marking it as empty : trace ( np ) Irip : empty = yee . 
Bounding nodes have to be declared as such in the grammar by statements of the form bounding_node  ( rip )  . 
bounding_node(s ) ~ s:tense=yes.
As in the second case , bounding nodes may be defined in terms of category symbols and features  . 
The main difference of argument movement to other approaches for the description of discontinuities like extraposition grammars  ( \[ Per81\] ) is that argument movement is not restricted to nested rule application  . This makes the approach especially atractive for ascrambling analysis of the relative free word order in the German Mi~telfeld as explained in more detail below  . 
3 Some facts on German syntax 3 . 1 Bas ic assumpt ions In the following we will sketch tile basic structures of German syntax  . According to the position of the finite verb , we distinguish sentences with the verb in the second  ( a )  , the first ( b ) and the last position ( c ) . 6 (1) a . Karlfdhrlnach Hamburg .

In accordance with the mentione deonfigurational analysis of the german sentence  , we suppose an unmarked " underlying " structure , that is similar to the order in timger man subordinate clause  . This structure contains four different positions for verb arguments  , as exemplified by the following sentences .

ID rules define the hierarchical structure of constituents  , LP rules the linear ordering of daughters constituents  . 
In this paradigm the german Miftelfeldinelu'ding the finite verb typically is supposed to form a fi at structure  , generated by an ID rule like a ---> np\[no ~ , np\[akk\] , np\[dat\] , v\[~ln\] , vk\[infin\]r . The elements on the right hand side can then be ( partially ) ordered by LP statements of the form vf : fi ~ <   up0 np < vk ( a finite verb precedes an NP , a VK follows an NP ) . As no LP statement is made for the NPs , the rules generate all possible permutations of NPs  . 
(13 ) I shat dot Mann der Fraud ~ Buch gegeben \] \[8 hatdex Frauder Mannd ~ Bachgegeben \] I shat das Buch der Mann der Frange geben \] I shat der Frandu Buch der Manngegeben \]\ [ shat der Mann du Buch der Frangegeben \] So  , where TUG supposes a fixed unmarked word order , from which marked orders are derived by movement rules  ( scrambling )  , GPSG and ItPSG suppose unordered ID rules and express constraints on order explicitly by LP Statements  . The same holds for the position of the finite verb in the different german sentence types  . As for movement to the Vorfeld the GPSG/HPSG approach using the slash feature and the TUG approach are rather similar  , as in fact movement is implemented in TUG by structure sharing  .

as in TUG allows for more elegant formulations of the facts  . 
3.3, 1 Preposition stranding
In many German dialects , prepositional profor rrm liked amdord soegs n and question forms like vaornit or wo fefen can be used discontinuously  . Both the slash analysis and the movement to the Vorfeld are able to describe appropriately sentences like  ( 14 b . ) , where the pronoun part of a prepositional preform is detached from its preposition  . 
(14) a . Damit kanner diese Theorie wider-legen.

There can he this theory with defeat " With th ~ heeande ~ a the theory " Whereas the preceding data give strong evidence for movement into the Vet  . reid , preposition stranding in German is not restricted to that position  . The daofa discontinuous preform can also occur in the

What can he there for a theory with defeat " What a theory can he defeat with this " b  . Was ~ kanner da/t / fdreine Theoriet/mit widerlegen  . 
Evidently , a formalism who~slash feature allows only for one discontinuous constituent has to describe da  . . . mit by LP rules . Therefore , da and mit would have to be of the same constituent as diese Theorie  . 
But in 14 ( a ) damit obviously forms one constituent . 
It is unclear how in a flat structure the obligatoriness of d a can be expressed  , an effect that naturally falls out of the trace approach  .

(17) a . dai \] der Chefihni hr vorstellt that ths boss him\[ace\]hsr\[dat\]presents " that the boss presents her to him " b  . daft der Chefihr denneu en Mitarbeiter vorstellt that the boss hsr\[dat\]then sucollsgue presants " that the boss presents the new col -legue to her " c  . * dabder Chef denneu en Mitarbeiterihr vorstellt * that the boss the new colle~le\[ace\ ] her\[dat\]presents d  . * daft der Chefihrihn vorstellt * that the boss hor\[dat\]him\[ace\]presents e  . d aftihn ihr der Chef vorstellt that him\[ace\] her\[dat\]the boss presents ?  *7daft ihn der Chefi hr vorstellt * that his\[ace\ ] the boss her\[dat\]presentsg  . * d aftihn ihrer vorstellt * that hi=\[ace\] her\[dat\]he\[sol\]presantsEventhoughit might be possible to describe these restrictions by a set of LP statements  , our impression is that this kind of analysis obscurs the rather simple pronoun word order  . Furthermore , we cannot see how LP rules could allow for ( a ) and ( e ) while excluding ( f ) a . I hn may preceed the nominativ NP , but only if there is no dativ pronoun following the latter  , sInour analysis , personal pronouns have a fixed position in the sentence it her between  S1 and Sorbetween Sund VP . 
( is ) a . \[sa\[stdafteslihrj\[stierMann\[vl , tj\[v , t , aibt\]\]\]\]\]b . \[sa\[stdaft\[stierManneslihri\[vP tj\[Vat  , gibt\]\]ll\]3 . 4 AC I - const ruct ions In ACI-coustructious however a personal pronoun may very well follow a non-nominativ NP  . Compare (17 e . ) and (19) . 
s ( f ) seems to be somehow acceptable in some dialects but completely a grammatical in others  . 
? As far as we understand it , also a solution by sequence union \[ Rea89\] could not account for these facts . 
(19) a . Gestern hat Karl den Jungeni hr helfen la 88 en . 
? sstsr day has Karl the boy her\[dat\]he lplet " Yesterday Karl has made the boy help her " b  . Gestern hat Karl den Jungen\[veihrhelfen\] lassen  . 
To save an LP analysis as indicated above we would have to say that ihr helfen is part of another constituent as denJungen  , therefore the LP statements do not hold between den Jangen and ihr  . The structure of the sentence ( 19 a ) might then be sketched as in ( 19b )  . 
But now consider the following sentence : ( 20 ) Gestern hatsie hKarleine L~sungs in-fallen l ~sen  . 
Yesterday has Karl himsel fasolution come_to ~ ind let This sentence  , although it repreeents a regular ACI-construction and consequently must have an embedded VP constituent  , shows the same serialization wrt . 
the pronoun as (17) , where all NPs belonged to the same constituent . ID and LP rules therefore lead to a contradiction i handling  ( 19 ) and ( 20 ) t ? . A TUG description on the other hand can make use of a scrambling analysis in  ( 20 )  . The pronoun sich leaves a trace in the pronoun position of the embedded construction and appears in the appropriate pronoun position of the matrix constituent  , thereby maintaining the relevant serialization conditions in both constituents  . 
And a further restriction may be implemented when configurational relations are available : the scrambling of a dative pronoun out of an ACI -coustruction as shown in  ( 20 ) is sensitive as to whether the accusative of the A CI-verb replaces an external or internal nominative of the embedded verb  . Finitecin fallen marks its nominative internally , finite half camarks it externally . Only internal nominative-accusatives allow being scrambled over  , cf . (20) with (21) . 
(21 ) * Gestern hatihr Karlden Jungenhelfen lassen . 
* Yesterday hashsr\[dat\]Karl the boy help let  3  . 4 . 1 Scrambl ing and Themat ic S t ructure Another aspect of the configurational differentiation between external and internal arguments can be made use of in analysing the thematic structure of a sentence  . Soe . g . the thematic differentiation between wide and narrow scope of a verbal argument depends on its appearing in marked or unmarked position  . 
Compare the readings of (22) and (23) vs .  (26) , where boldface marks the posodically prominent syllable :  10A description like the one in \[ Rea89\] would presumably have to state that verbs like h ? lfen are combined in ACI-constructions by concatenation ~ verbs like t in \] allen by sequence union  . 
A~q'ES DECOL1 NG-92 . NA ~' ES , 2328 Ao IYr 199291 PRec . OFCOLING-92, NANTES , AUG .  2328 ,  1992  ( 22 ) \[ ch glaubed aft der Kollege dem Vorst and widers prochen hat  . 
I think that the collegue has the board contradicted " I think that the collegue has contradicted to the board  .  "  ( 23 ) Ich glaubed abdem Vorstan der Kollege widers prochen hat  . 
I think that the board the collegue contradicted has  "1 think that the colluege has contradicted to the board  . "  ( 22 ) is a possible answer to the question what happened on the meel mg yesterday whereas  ( 23 ) is only allowed in specific contexts such as Wet hat dem V or stand widers prochen ?  . Widersprcchen like helfea marks its nominative xternally  , therefore the dative NP follows the nominative NP in the umnarked word order as shown in  ( 22 )  . If scrambling applies as in ( 23 ) this correlates with a change in the thematic and prosodic structure  . In the TUG framework this would be achieved in combining the scrambling mechanism with a feature structure that indicates the desired thematic interpretation of the sentence :  ( 24 ) vp---> np < tracs ( ana , np : trace ) , vp:hh:SCope=narro ~; , (25) vp ---> np , v ~ . 
np : scope = vp : scope.
A straightforward implementation f this observation in the ID/LP format however would come to a halt in the case of  ( 26 ) :  ( 26 ) Ich glaubed abdem Vorst and die LSsung einge falle nist  . 
I think that the board the solution come_to_mind has " I think that the solution has come to mind to the board  . " Although the nominative follows the dative in ( 26 ) the sentence has wide scope interpretation and unmarked prosodic structure  11   ,   ( 26 ) again is a likely answer to the general question Wasist gestern passiert ? This clearly contradicts  ( 22 ) - ( 23 ) if only the surface case marking of the arguments can be referred to in the generalization  . On the other hand this result is exactly what would be expected by a TUG analysis : Since e in fallen marks its nominative internally  , no scrambling is involved in (26) vs .  (23) .

4 Parsing with TUG
TUG can be processed by a parser and a generator.
Before parsing and generation , the grammar is coat-piled to a more efficient form  . The first compilation step that is common to generation and parsing transforms the attribute -value-pair stucture to  ( PRO-LOG ) term structure . This transformation makes use of the type definitions  . For parsing , TUG is processed by a Tomita parser\[Tom86\] . For usage in that parser the result of the transformation to PROLOG further undergoes several transformations  ( expansion of head nlovement rules , transformation of argument movement rules , elimination of empty productions , conversion to LR . (K ) format and computation of LR tables ) . 
This compilation leads to a considerable increase in processing speed that makes it possible to use TUG for the syntactic description in real -time systems  . Especially the seperat compilation of head movement a ml argument movement leads to runtime grammars that do not show the usual decrease in efficic ncy due to empty productions  ( traces )  . In fact , a compiled TUG does not contain empty productions any longer  . 
Parsing time for simple sentences of about 10 words using a grammar of German with rather broad coverage is between  1 and 2 sees . on the average on a SUNSPARCI workstation running Quintus Prolog  , even if the sentence contains verb fronting , argument movement to the Vorfeld and scrambling in tile Mittelfeld  ,   5 Conclusion We have presented Trace & Unification Grammar  , a grammar formalism that tries to bridge the gap between UG and GB theory with the aim of adopting many of the linguistic descriptions of German found in the linguistics literature  . Besides German , the presented grammar formalism has also been used successfully to describe a smaller subset of Chinese  . We have compared TUG descriptions of some phenomena in german syntax to approaches that do not make use of movement rules but use \[ D/LP rules instead and shown that in all these cases TUG provides a simple and elegant description whereas the ID/LP approach in most cases even fails to describe the data at all  . Furthermore we have briefly mentioned tile way TUG can be compiled to an efficient parser  . Empirical tests have shown that using movement rules and traces does not lead to a considerable decrease in parsing speed  .
