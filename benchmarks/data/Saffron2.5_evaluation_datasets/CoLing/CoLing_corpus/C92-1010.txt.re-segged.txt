A given stell Lew'n I hough itself qlnt0 cornph+x , call generally serve as basis for evellll lol'l '   ( ' o111 l ) lexwords . Consequ . ntly , agglutinative languages contain words of considerable COnll~lexity  , and parsing such languages necessitates a thorough morphological analysis  .

" In this example , one word mTurkisll corresponds to a flll sentence in English  . 
Each suitix has a certain flmction and modifies the semantic information in the stenip receding it  . In our example , the root mori'~heme ~ EKOSLOVAKYA is then alne of the country Czechoslovakia and the suffix -/  , I converts the meaning into Czechoslovakian , while the following suffix LA~makes a verb from the previous stem meaning to become a Czechoslovakian  , t , and soo 11 . 
2.1. Turkish Phonetic Model
Being phonetic , the Turkish language can be a dal)ted t . o a number of different alphabets . In the , past , various alphabet shaw ~ been used to transcribe Turkish  , e . g . , Arabic . Since 1928, Latin characters have been used . The Turkish alphabet consists of 29 letters of which 8   ( A , E , I , LO ,  (3 , U , ( ~) are vowels , and 21(B , C , C  ~ , D , F , G , ( LH , J , K , L , M . N , P , R , S ,   , q ,   , q , V , Y , Z ) are consonants . 
Turkish word formation uses a number of phonetic harlrlony rules  . Vowels and COltSOllants change in certain ways when a suffix is a pl  ) ended to a root , so that sucl lharn lony constraints are not violated  . 
2.1.1. Vowcl Changeiti Suffixes
A hnost all suffixes in Turkish ilse one of two basic vowels and their all ophones  . We have denoted these sets of all ophones with braces around the main vowels A and  1  . as A and I . The allophones of Atare A and E , where It represents I , i , U , or r . The vowels O and ( are only used in root in or l ) hemes ( especially in the first syllable ) of Turkish words . ~ The vowel harltl Oll Vrt lies require thai vowels in a silt L fix challge according to certain rules whell they are affixed to a stem  . The first vowel in thr suftix changes according to the last vowel of the sl  . em . Succeeding vowel silitile suffix change according to the vowel pre-reding it  . If we denole the preceding vowel ( lie it in the sten , or in the suffix ) by v then At is resolved as A if r is A ,  1 . O . or U . otherwise it is resolved as E .

3.1. Dictionary
The dictionary is bmsed oil the Turkish\Vriting Guide  \[2  , 3\] as the source . Some words in the dictionary haw , to lie marked~s having certaiu semantic and structural propertie such as being a verbal root or a nom-iua \] root  , being a proper noun , not obeying to vowel harmony rules , deformiug under certain conditions , and so on . For examph ~, tile word BUII . UN ( nose ) have to beniarked as being an olllilla\[root , and de-forming by vowel ellipsis . For this reason , for each word in Ihedictiouary a series of flags represeuting certain properties of that word are heht  . Tllus . each elitry of tim dictionary Colltains a word in Turkish and a series of flags showing certain properties of that wor  (  \[ . 
Nearly 2: 1, 500 words . .'ach having 7 h , lterson the averagi N are listed illotirCtil ' roilt diclionary  , 41 flags per e .

3.2. Syllabification Check
Analyzing all t , he words in Turkish \ Vritithg Guide \[23\] and all the suffixes ill Turkish \[1  , b \] . w ~" have constructed a legular expression and a corresponding finile stale automaton for validating if a word matches the syl lable struct ttreules of Turkish  \[18\] This reg+/llar t?xpr0ssiOll is tised as a heuristic illolt r spelling checker  . The input word is first processed with the regular expression  . It is reported as misspelled if its syll a Me structure cannot be mat  . ched wilh this expression , i . e . , tile phonemes of Ihe word do no ! form valid sequences accordiug to Turkish syllable struc -iurcs  . ( ) n tile other h and , if it . can lie matched , it , is flu'ther analyzed as it . tuay still be a non-Turkish or a misspelled word . 
With th(-hell > of tile syllal ) ificat . ioncheek , most of the typographical e . rrors Call be detected . For examph ~ . 
if the word YAPMAI (( to make ) were typed as YP- . \I,\I , 2 or YAPMKA . the word would not be matched by the expression and its spelling wouhl be reported incorrect  . Ontile other hand , if il , we wwritten as YAPMEI ( , where a vowel harmony error is made , it would pass the syllabification cheek , but would liere-porled as misspelled during morl /hol Jhonemic checks  . 
3.3. Root Determination
Before analyzing the morphol Amnenfic and morpho logical structures of a Tm'kish word  , the root has to be determined . If \[ he word passes the syllabification check , its root is searched in the dictionary rising a maxilnal match algorithm  . In this algorithm , lirst ; \[ he list of all\[lags can Imhmndin Solak \[2  ( 1\] . 
AcrEsDECOLING-92 , NANTES ,   2328   AO6-r   1992   42 the whole word is searched in the dictionary , If it is found then the word has no suffixes and therefore its spelling is correct  . Otherwise , we remove a letter from tile right and search tile restllting substring  . We continue this by removiug letters from the right until we find a root  . If no root can be found although the first letter of the word is reached  , tile word is reported as misspelled . 
The maximum length substring of the word that is present in tile dictionary is riot always its root  . If fin't . her analyse show that the word is misspelled , a new root is searched m the dictionary , this time removing letters from the end of the previous root  . . If a Ilew root can be found the same operations are repeated  , otherwise tile word is reported & s misspelled . 
Root determination presents some dittieulties wheu the root of the word is deformed  . For the root words which have to be deformed during certain agglutinations  , a flag indicating that property is set in the dictionary  . For example , the root of the word , ~EHRE ( to the city ) must be found as ~ jgltiR ( city )  . In order to determine it correctly , when the substring SEHR is not found in the dictionary  , considering that it illay be a deforined root by vowel ellipsis  , the vowel I is inserted between the consonants 11 and R , and the word ~ EHIR is searched in the dictionary  . When it is fotm d , tile flag corresponding to vowel ellipsis is checked  . Since it is set for this word , the root of the word S , ' I '; IIRE isd cterlnined as ~ EIIiR , and remain-ins analyses are contiuued . If that word were written as . ~EHiRE , we should report it ms incorrect although ~ Elt iR+dative ease suffix form looks correct  . For all other root defin'mations , the real root of the word can be fot nld by u /aking such cheeks and some necessary chauges  ( see\[20\] )  . 
For some roots both of the refills above are valid . 
For example , both METN\[ ( accusative of text ) and METiN\]\[ ( accusative of strong ) are correct although the root of both words is MET\[N  ( text , strong ) be-catlse this word call be used in two different meanings  . 
3.4. Morphophonemic Check
Turkish words obey vowel and COllSOll ~ llltharmouy rules during agglutination  ( see sections : 3 . 2 . 1 and 3 . 2 . 2) .

For example , the root of tile word BEYAZ-LA~TIR MAY ANLARIAN ( from those which do not cause to hecome white ) is found as the noun BEYAZ ( white ) in our dictionary .

Word analysis application to spelling checking of this language  . 
Parsing agglutinative word structures necessitates rather nontrivial phonological and morphological analyses which present special difficulties in the development of parsers for such languages  , not usually encountered in parsers for other languages  . As a re-sub , the number of parsers developed for agghit in a -five languages  , and particularly for Turkish , is quite limit . ed , and they have certain shortcomings . We have solved most of the problelns encountered in the previous parsers by lnaking a detailed and careful research on Turkish word formation rules and their exceptions  \[20\]  . These results may hopefully be helpful for future researchers on Turkish linguistics  . We should note t . hatewm though it is claimed that word for-marion rules in Turkish are well-defined and Turkish is a very regular language  , as used today it shows many irregularities that cause the ln ' oblem of parsing I  . his language to become a very hard and interesting problem Many grammar books haw ~ been referred to collect  , Turkish word format . ion rules , hit hose books , after each rule is defined , usually it is reminded that tliel'elllay occur sonte exceptions to that  , rule illSOllle condit , ions , hutmostly those conditions cannot be " well " defined  , For example , in all Turkish grammar books , it is said that " When a Turkish word ending w it . hone of the consonants P ,  ~' , T , K receives a suffix beginning with a consonant , that final consonant is soft , cued , bult , here are some such words whose final consonant does not change  . "\] lowever , none of the books says what the common propert . y of those words which do no to beyt , o that rule is , because most AcrEs DECOLING-92 , NA~n'ES . 2328 Ao\[rr 199244 PRec .
