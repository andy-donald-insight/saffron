Abstract
This papers nggests a method to align
Korean English parallel corpus .'1 ? he
structural dissimilarity between Korean
and Indo-European languages requires
more flexible measures to evaluate the
alignment candidates between the bilin-
gual units than is used to handle the
pairs of Indo-European languages . The
flexible measure is intended to capture
the dependency between bilingual items
that can occur in different units according to different ordering rules  . The proposed method to accomplish Korean-
English aligmnent akes phrases as an alignment unit that is a departure from the existing methods taking words as the unit  . Phrasal alignment avoids the problem of alignment units and appease the problem of ordering mismatch  . The parameters are estimated using the EM algorithm  . The proposed alignment algorithm is based on dynamic programming  . In the experimenl , s carried out on 253 , 0 00 English words and its Korean translations the proposed method achived  68  . 7% in accuracy at phrase level and 89 . 2% in accuracy with the bilingual dictionary induced from the alignment  . ' File result of the alignment may lead to richer bilingual data than can be derived from only word -level aligments  . 
1 Introduction
Studies on parallel corpus consisting of multilin -gumtexts are often guided with the purpose to obtain linguistic resource such as bilingual dictionary  , bilingual grammars ( Wu 1995 ) and translation examples . Parallel texts have t ) roved to be useful not only intile development of statistical

machine translation ( Brown et al 1993 ) but also in other application such as word sense disana-biguation  ( Brown et al 1991 ) and bilingnal lexicography ( Klavans and Tzoukermann 1990 )  . As the parallel corpora become more and more accessible  , many researches based on the bilingual corpora are now encouraged that were once considered impractical  . 
Alignment as a study of parallel corpus refers to the process of establishing the correspondences between matching elements in parallel corpus  . 
Alignment methods tend to approach the problem differently according to the alignment units the methods adopt  . Of various alignment options , the alignlnent of word units is to compute a sequence of the matching pairs of words in a parallel corpus  . 
Figure 1 show the aligned results of a parallel corpus that was originally paired in a sentence level  . In figure 1 , the right hand side of pairwise aligmnent is the corresponding Korean words  . De-scribed in the parentheses on the right of each Korean word are corresponding English meaning and syntactic functions of the word  . 
The existing methods for the alignment of Indo -European language pairs such as English and French take words as aligning units and restrict the correspondences between words to be one of the functional mappings  ( one-to-one , one-to-l/K/EA lign , n ? k~-7-\[\[~:~--\[--Figure 2: Ov ( ' a ' view of the l ) roposed aligmnent method .

An early ~ ttemt ) to align Asian and \[ n do-l ! ; uropean l~mguage pairs is found from tim work by Wu and Xia  ( 199 d )  .

A Korean word is usually a smaller unit than an English word and a word-phrase is larger than an English word  . For this reason the exact that c has in English -French pair is hard to establish for the case of Koean-English  ( Shin et al 1995 )  . Consequently word-to-word or word-to-word-phrase alignment  ) etw cen Korean and l' ; nglish will suf ' + fee from trait mist natch attd low accuracy  . The complication of unit mismatch often implies the need of non-flmctional aligntnent such as many-to-many mapping  . Non-flmctiomd mapping tnay also occur in the l ! htglish-French case  , but with much less frequency . 
' l ' he table 1 shows the degree of mismatch between English words and Korean words that are analyzed by our atttomatic POS tagger and tnor-phological analyzer  . When we checked randomly selected 200 sentence pairs by hand , only a a . s % or all pairs have one + to-one correspondences between 
English words and Korean words.
2.3 Koreanto English Alignment
In this section , we propose a Korean to English aligmnent method that aligns in both word and phrase lewds at the same t  . ime . First , we introduce the method in word-to-word alignment  , att ( l then extend it to inchMephrase-to-phrase alignment  . 
By definition , a phrase in this paper refers to a linguistic unit of  1Tlore general structure than it is recognized in general from the terms  , noun and adverb phrases . A phrase is any arbitrary sequence of ad , iaeent words in a sentence . 
2 . 3 . 1 Base Method ( using only word-to-word correspondences ) Int ; he develop rnent of our method , we follow the basic idea of ' statisticaL1 translation proposed by Brown et al ( 11993 )  . '\[' oe very pair of sentences of e and k , we assign a value p(elk ) , the probability that a translator will pro ( luce e as its translation of k , where e is a sequence of English words and k is a sequence of Korean words  . 
p(e.lk ) = ~ r,(gIki ) (3) j = li = 0
In equation 3 , n and m are then mnl ) er of words in the English sentence and its correspoudil GK orean sentence k respectively  , cj and klare tit > aligtdng unit between l'2nglish sentence and Korean sentence k . c j r q + r e s e n l , sjth word in I " nglish sentence and k/represents ith word in Korean sentence  . For example , in Figure 1 English word " the " is ct and Korean word " ku " is k t  . 
2.3.2 Proposed Method ( Extended

The base method of word level aligt nn cnt is ex -tend  ( ' d with 1 ) hrase-level alignntett that ow'x-comes the dH Drence of matching unit and provides more opportunity for the extraction of richerlit > guistic information such as l  ) hrasal-lew q bilingual dictionary . To cot ) e with the data sparseness problem caused by considering all possible phrases  , we represent phrases by the tag sequences of their component words  . 
If an English sentence and its Korean translation k are partitioned into a sequence of ' phrases p  ~  . and t ) ~ of all possible sequences s(e , k ) , we can write p ( elk ) as in equation 5 where l ) ~ and Pk are phrase sequences and a ( p + , t > ~: ) denotes all possible alignments between Pe and Pk . 
/) ( elk ) > (4) < pk,p,>ES < Pk,p, . > CSa(pk , p + :) If we represent hephra . se-to-phrase correspondences using the tag sequence of phrase and words composing phrase  , The equatiou 5 can be rewritten as in equation 6 letting phrase match be represented by the tag sequence of phrases as well as words  . \[ n equation 6 , k ~ ~ is jth phrase of \] d ' ~ , and l(kP ~ l , je denotes the tag sequence of words composing phrase kj ' Pk  .

The dynamic programming in the context of al ignnent assumes fl tatth  , + , previoussions . The alignment decision , however , may depend on the previous matches to the extent that the results from dynamic programming in ay not be sufficiently accurate  . One popular solution is to maintain uppert-best cases instead of just one as following where max -t denotes the tth max candidate  . 
= max-t\[pi-a(t ') + log p(k ~ , , c~b )\] l<t /< r , l < j < Nl < a < L , l < b < L = ( j , < ~) = argmax-t\[~i_~(t ') + log p(ki ? , , ej , b)\]
I < t t < T , I < j < N l < a ~ L , I < b < L
As a result , the running complexity of the proposed algorithm becomes O  ( TL2MN )  . Taking T and Lasconstants , the order of complexity becomes O(MN ) . 
As another method to relax the problem of decision dependency on the previous matches  , preemptive scheme to find max matching of phrase k i  , ~ is adopted . In the preemptive aligmnent , the previou selection can be rematched with the better selection found by later decision  . 
In following algorithm , ~(ki , a , n ) denote ej , v which has nth highest matching w due with Korean phrase ki  , ~ among all possible matching Korean phrase and u ( ki , a , n ) carry the weight t brtile matching . ~ i , b indicate matched Korean phrase with ej , b in current status and v ~ j , ~ denote their matching weight . ' l ' he established matching in previous stage can be changed when another matching  , which has higer matching weight , is identified in this algorithm .

2.6 Experilnents
The total training corpus tbrour experiments consists of  254  , 100 English words and 178 , 300 Korean word-phrases . The content of training corpus is summarized in table  2  . 
At IMM Part-of-Speech tagger is used to tag words be ibrealigmnents  . An accurate IIMM designed by the authors for Korean sentences taking into account the fact that a Korean sentence is a sequence of word -phrases i used  ( Shin et al 95 )  . Thel ) enn Treebank POS tagset that is composed of 48 tags and 52 Korean tagset is used in the tagging . The errors that is generated by morphological analysis and tagging cause many of the alignment errors  . 
q bavoid the noise due to the insufficient bil in gum sentences  , we adopted two significance filter--ing methods that were introduced by Wu and Xia  ( 1994 )  . First , the Korean sentences consisting of words with more than  5 occurrences in the corpus are considered in the experiment  . Second , wese . .
lected the English words that accounts for the top  0  . 80 of the translation probability density given a
Korean word.
When we selected 200 sentence pairs randomly and manually tested aligned results  , we obtained 68 . 7% precision at the phrase level and 89 . 2% precision of bilingual dictionary induced from the alignment  . The table 3 and 4 illustrate tile bilingual knowledge acquired from the aligned results  . 
The information in table 4 is the unique product of phrase-level alignment . 
3 Conclusion
With the alignment of Korean q ~ , nglish entences , the most serious problem , that is seldom found a tindo-European language pairs  , is how to overcome tile differences of word unit and word order  . 
The proposed method is an extension of word level alignment and solves the problems of word unit mismatch and word order through phrase level alignment  . We have also described several alternatives of alignment and parameter estimation  .

Since the results from the method are richer with linguistic information  , other application such as machine translation and multilingual information retrieval are promising research areas  .
