Summar L
In this paper the methodological ba-
s is of the ' computational linguistics approach ' for representing the meaning of natural language sentences is investiga-ted  . Its adherance to principles of formal linguistics and formal philosophy of language like the ' separation of levels of syntactic and semantic analysis '  , and the " Fregean " principle may be contrast-ed with the ' artificial intelligence approach '  . A " Montague " style method of mapping the syntax of natural language onto the syntax of the ' semantic language ' used as the means of internal representation in the information system PLIDIS is presented  . Rules for defining subsequent levels of representation like ' syntax-interpretative level  '  , ' redundancy ' freelevel ' are given . 

The present paper presents ideas concerning a methodology of the ' semantics in computational linguistics '  ( COL-semantics )  . 
There is the following hypothesis underlying :
In the field of COL-semantics algorithms and computer programs are developed which deliver structures of lingui-stic analysis and representation that can be compared with those of formal linguistic semantics and satisfy the adequacy criteria of certain linguistic theories  . They therefore are suitable instruments for developing and testing such theories  . 
COL-semantics hence proceeds in a way different from the semantic processing as it is found in the framework of artificial intelligence  ( AI-semantics )  . 
AI-semantics is not so much linked to the semantics of formal linguistics or logic but rather to cognitive psychology  , problem solving theory and the theory of knowledge representation which has been recently put forward within AI itself  .   1 Between both branches of semantic processing of natural language that are realized in computer systems there therefore exists a difference in aims  , theories and methods . 
Starting from a brief sketch ot the aims and theories of both approaches one essential methodological principle of COL-semantics will be elaborated in the second chapter of the paper  . In the third chapter COL-semantic methods will be ex-emplified by a concrete application  , the production of semantic representations in an information system  . Stress will not be laid on the question of what a COL-semantic representation should look like but how levels of a semantic represen-t at ion can be systematically related with natural language and with each other  . 
Aims and theoretical concept__E of COL-semantics and AI-semantics The difference of aims and methods can only be outlined here as far as i t is relevant with respect to the methodolog i-  ca1 divergence which will be dealt within detail : Aim of AI-semantics is the si- mulation of the human language understand -ing and/or language generating process that is to be understood as a manifesta-tion of intelligent human problem solv-ing behav iour  . Aim of COL-semantics is the algorithmic generation of descrip-tive structures  ( of a generativ-semantic , interpretative , logico-semantic or other type ) out of a given natural language in-put . Both purposes can be partial aims or in termediate steps within a larger project like'simulation of dialogue be-hav iour '  , ' natural language information or question answering system '  . 
Thus the AI-approach leads to a the-ory where the object of explanation  ( or simulation ) is " rational human behaviour ''2 or more specifically human language behaviour as a rational psychic process  , whereas in the theory of linguistic semantics language is being objectified as a generated structure or a system which can be considered independently from the associated mental processes  . In lingui-stic semantics and also in COL -semantics meta-linguistic notions which refer to language as a system like ' synonymy '  , ' equivalence ' and ( particularly in the formal linguistics based on logic  ) ' truth ' and ' entailment ' are crucial ; in AI-se-mantics however we have the ' behaviour ' oriented conce~ts of ' inferencing '  , ' dis-ambiguating ' , " reasoning ' , ' planning ' et co
A methodological principle of

A distinctive feature of linguistics , especially logico-linguistic theories , is the separation of different " expression " and " content " levels of analysis and representation and the  speci--202 fication of mapping rules between them ( surface structure versus deep structure , syntactic structure versus semantic structure ) . In Montague grammar this differentiation between a well defined syntactic level and an also well defined semantic level of description is a methodological-lynecessary consequence of the " Fregean " principle  . The Fregean principle states that the meaning of an expression can be determined on the basis of the meanings of its logically simple constituent expressions and the syntactic structure of the whole expression  . This principle has been revived by Montague and has ~ eenre-alized in his theory of language in such a way that the syntactic and the semantic structure of a natural language expression are respectively represented as expressions of formal systems  ( syntax and meaning algebras ) between which systems there exist well defined formal relationships  ( homomorphisms )  . 
When this concept is transferred to the operationalizing of linguistic analysis in a computer system it will be excluded to conceive the mapping from natural language into semantic representation as a simple integrated pass  , wherein the course of parsing a sentence the valid semantic interpretation is assigned to each occurring item or group of items and where the possibilities of inference and association with stored background knowledge are flocally f realized without ever generating a full syntactic analysis  . 
Saving an explicit level of syntactic representation seems to be compatible with the Fregean principle only under the condition that the algorithm incorporates a grammar  ( in the technical sense of a consistent set of generating or accepting syntactic rules  )  , but for reasons of optimization directly associates or applies semantic ' values ' or ' rules ' in processing the corresponding syntactic ' nodes ' or ' rules  '4  , or even allows a semantic control of rule selection without leaving the parsing mode  . This condition however is mostly not maintained in AI parsing approaches where the one step processing is understood as a cognitively adequate analogue of human linguistic information processing and where even the terminal and non terminal symbols of the " grammar " are interpreted as semantic categories  . 5
Syntactic and semantic representation in an information system 
The way of processing natural language according to the principles of COL-semantics shall be demonstrated by the linguistic component of a natural language information system  . The description iso-riented at the application area and the structure of the system PLIDIS  ( information system for controlling industrial water pollution  , developed at the Institut fuer deutsche Sprache , Mannheim ) .   6 Giving only the overall structure of the system we have the following processings and levels : morphological analysis of natural language input ~ syntactic analysis  ( level of syntactic representation ) ~transduction into formal representation language  ( level of semantic representation ) interpretation ( evaluation ) against the database ~ answer generation
The formal representation language is the language KS an extended first order predicate calculus  , where the features going beyond predicate calculus are many sorted domain of individuals  , lambda-abstraction and extended term building .   7 In the following two aspects of the semantic representation will be treated : - the mapping between syntactically analyzed natural language expressions and their KS counterparts will be investigated-a differentiation between three levels of semantic representation will be accounted for:  ( level l ) syntax-interpre-tative level , ( level2) canonical level , ( level3) database-related level , 
All three levels follow the same syntax , i . e . the syntax of KS and have the same compositional model theoretic semantics  ; they differ in their nonlogical constant symbols . 
_Mapping_natural language into the kemantic representation l~i ! g~ageKS 
In analogy with Montague's " theory of translation " in " Universal Grammar " we assume that the syntactic structures of natural language  ( NL , here German ) and the semantic language ( here KS ) are similar , i . e . there exists a translation function f , such that the following holds : ( l . l . ) Given the categories of a categorial grammar of NL  , fis mapping from these categories on the syntactic categories of KS  . I . e . If m,~I , . . . , ~ n are basic categories of German , then f(~) , f(~I ) ,  . . . , f(#n ) are syntactic categories of K $ . 
If ~/ ~ I/ . . . /~ n is a derived category ( functor category ) of NL , then f(~)/f(~1)/ . . . /f(~n ) is a derived category of KS . 
(1 . 2 . ) If a is-an expression of category 6 in NL(a6) , then f ( a ) is an expression of category f ( 6 ) in KS ( f ( a ) f ( 6 ) ) . 
(1 . 3 . ) The concatenation of an expression of the derived category m/~I /  . . . /#n with expressions of category ~1, . . . ,#nre-sulting in an expression of category --203--~/#I  /  .   .   . /~ n ~ ~ I ~ . . . ~ Fn~isrendered in KS by the construction of a list\[f ~/~/  .   .   . / ~ n)Z (~) .   .   .  # ( Fn ) \] with the category ~' ( ~ ) ( concatenation and list const ruct ion are def ined for categories instead of expressions in order to zmprove readability  )   . 
Thus the ' transduction grammar ' NL-
KS is the triple < GNL , GKS , ~>
We now specify a minimal categoria\[grammar of German GNL  . A particular of GNL is the analysis of verbs a smary predicates  , i . e . in the categorial frame-worK , as functions from mNP into S 8 and the analogue treatment of nouns as func-to t categories  9 taking their attributes as arguments .

By applying the function ~ we have got a grammar GKS for our semantic language KS in an inductive way  . We now give the following lexical cor respondence rules for some nonlogical express ions of NL  , taken from the application area of PLIDIS .

Meaning postulates for generating ~ a nonical represent at lons 
Both sentences have received different represent at ions on level I  , they are nevertheless synonymous at least as far as the context of information seeking is concerned  . 
An important principle in COL-se-mantics is the notion of structural  ( not lexical ) synonymy . The following intui-tively valid synonymy postulates  ( meaning postulates ) can be formulated . 
- -205- - ( 1 ) ANL noun phrase containing n ( n_>o ) attributes ( category O-N/NP/ . . . /NP)
II-E Yiih-gs is synonymous with an NP conta ining n+\]attributes  , where then +\] stat-tribute is an unspecified " placeholder " attribute  , under the precon-dition that the central noun of the 
NP systematically admits lOn+\]attributes:eine Probe is synonymous eine Probebei with einem Betrieb  ( ' a sample ( ' a sample of an of sewage industrial plant ' ) water ' ) 
The application of this principle may be iterated.
( 2 There are verb classes the elements of which have no descriptive meaning  ( " noncontent verbs " )  , in German the socalled " Funktions verben " , the copula segn and others ) . In such ca-ses the NP as object or subject of the verb is the content bearer or ' principal ' NP  , e . e . it becomes the predicate of the proposition . Such a sentence is synonymous with a corresponding sentence containing a content verb equivalent in meaning to the content bearing NP  . For example:
Arsenge halt liegt in der Probevor.
(' There exists an arsenic content in the sample . ') is synonymous with
Die Probeenth ~ it Arsen.
(' The sample contains arse nic.')
In such a noncontent verb proposition a noun phrase with a place hol-der attribute can also function as a " second order " principal NP  , i . e . its unspecified attribute can be replaced by a " filler " NP  , occurring as argument of the noncontent verb : Arsenge halt liegt bei Lauxmann in der Probevor  . is synonymous with
Die Probebei Lauxmannenth Zlt Arsen.
Both postulates shall be applied for transducing the level \] representations of NL sentences into level  2 representations . We first give a definition of ' principal term ' , i . e . the KS construction corresponding to a ' principal NP'  . 
( Def . ) A principal term in a formula containing as PRAED the translation of anon content verb is a term that is capable  , according to its semantic and syntactic structure  , to embed other argument terms o ~ the translation of the noncontent verb as its arguments  . 
The operationalized version of the two principles is now after having shift-ed them onto the KS level:  ( 1: maximality principle ) When a NL-expres-sion has n analysis ( n  ~ 2J in level \] which only differ in the number of arguments  , then the level 2 representation consists of the ' maximal ' level I expression  , i . e . the expression containing the largest number of arguments  . Any failing arguments are to be substituted by ( existentially bound ~ variables . 
(2: transformation principle ) (2 . 1 . ) When the PRAED of a formula is the translation of a noncontent verb  , at least one of its arguments must be a principal term  . 
(2 . 2 . ) A formula containing the translation of a non content verb must be transformed into an expression which contains the PRAED of a principal term as predicate iff there is an unambiguous mapping of the arguments of the translation of the noncontent verb a  ) into arguments of a principal term or b ) into a princapal term such that a well-formed formula of leve\]  2 is obtained . 
We now state that PROBE and ENTHALT are ' maximal ' expressions and PROBEI and 
ENTHALTI must be mapped into them respectively and that further holds : VORLIEG is the translation of the noncontent verb vorliegen 
PROBE is the PRAED of a second order principal term with respect to a ' plant ' argument ENTHALT is the PRAED of a principal term with respect to a ' sample ' argument 
Then the two examples of level I are mapped into a single representation on level  2: \[ENTHALT\[JOTA\[LAMBDAx\[PROBEG-L XJ\]\]AS1\] The reduction of synonymous structures in the canonical level of representation meets the criteria of economy as they are necessary in a computer system  . IIAs we have tried to show , however , it can be based upon general linguistic principles and need not be imputed to the field of " world semantics "  . On the other side admitting paraphrases as natural language input  ( as our examples are ) improves the systems " cooperativeness " towards the user  . In PLIDIS special aspects of the world model are accounted for in the level  3 representations which mirror the relational structure of the data model to some extent  . We cannot go into the details of the relationship between level  2 and level 3 ~ or reasons of space . 

Comparison with other approaches
Language processing systems that are oriented at Montague grammar or model theoretic semantics are being developed among others by Friedman et al  , Sond heimer and the PHLIQA I group . A theoretical discussion of the relationship between model theoretic semantics and AI -semantics can be found in Gunji and Sond-heimer cf  . also Hobbs and Rosenschein St . Bien and Wilks ( with a contrary vlew ) . 
The methodological ideas presented here are most closely related with the approach of multilevel semantics pursued in PHLIQAi  . But unlike the PHLIQA i approach we regard the level  ( sJ  of lingui-stic representation not only under the more formal aspect of syntax interpretation but  , as the last chapters show , we also take into account aspects of semantics of natural language word classes and structural synonymy  . 
Notes 1 There are certainly important interactions with empirial semantic work done in the last  10 years , so Ortony and Wilks stress the pervasive influence of Fillmore  . Like any other systematic distinction the one between formalllnguistic semantics and 
AI-semantics is somewhat simplifying :
Within AI there are semantic approaches which are more or less oriented at formal logic  , so the one of McCar-thy , Creary or Nash-Webber and Reiter and others . As typical AI-semantic approaches we regard the ones of Schank and his colleagues  , Wi?ks or Charniak ( cf . for instance the articles in
Charniak and Wilks).
2 Hayes ,   9   3 Slightly exaggerating this tendency is formulated by Schank in Schank et al  . ):"Researchers in NPL ( natural language processing in AI ) have become less and less concerned with language issues per se  . We are more interested in inferencing and memory models for example  . "( p . 1 OO 8 )   4 Such systems are presented for instance in Riesbeck  , Norman and Rumelhart , and even more programmatically in Schank et al , DeJong . Also in systems conceived as database interfaces like LIFER  ( Hendrix ) and PLANES ~ altz ) " semantic " grammars are used . A theoretical discussion on the role of syntax can be found in Schank et al  5 I . e . one has to check , whether in systems contain lng only " part grammars " or working with a syntactic " pre-pro -cessing " the syntactic rules which were effectively used  , can be combined resulting in a coherent and consistent grammar  . Questions of syntac-tic-semantic and purely semantic grammars underlying parsers are also discussed from a theoretical point of view in Wahlster  . 
The system PLIDIS is described in
Kolvenbach , L6tscher and Lutz.
The language KS ( " Konstrukts prache " ) is described in Z if on un . 
Cress well gives an analogous categorial description for verbs  . Like in this minimal grammar in applying the rule of concatenation phenomena of word order are neglected  . 
Keenan and Faltz introduce the category of " function noun "  ( in our framework O-N/NP )   10 The vague condition of " systematically admitting " is made concrete in PLIDIS by prescribing a semantic " sort " for each argument of a predicate  . 
ii This reduction is done in PLIDIS with the help of meaning postulates which are interpreted by a theorem prover  .
