A study was r~ade of tile degree of similar i tybetween pairs of Russian nouns  , as expressed by their tendency to occur in sentences with identical ~  , , ords in ident ica l syntact i c re la t ionsh i ps  . A similarity matrix was prepared for for ty nouns  ; for each pair of nouns the number of shared ( i ) adjective dependents , ( ii ) noun dependents , and ( iii ) noun governors was automatically retrieved from machine-processed text  . The similarity coefficient for each pa ir ~  ; as determined as the ratio of the total of such shared ~' ords to the product of the f requencies of the two nouns in the text  . The 78~ pairs were ranked according to this coeff icient  . The text comprised 12(1 , ~ 00 running words of physics text processed at The RAND Corporation  ; the frequencies of occurrence of the forty nouns in this text ranged from  42 to 328  . 
The results suggest that the sample of text is of sufficient size to be useful for the intended purpose  . Many noun pairs with similar proper t i es  ( synonymy , antonym ) , , der ivat ion from d is t r ibut iona l ly s imi larver bs  , etc .   ) are characterized by high similarity coe fficients  ; the converse is not observed . The relevance of various syntactic rela-t ionships as criteria for meas ~ rement is d is cussed  .

MEASURENIiNTOFSIMILARITYBETWEENNOUNS
I . INTRODUCTION
One of the goals of studies in Distributional Semantics is the establishment of word classes on the basis of the observed behavior of words in written texts  . A convenient and significant way of discussing " behavior " of words is in terms of syntactic relationship  . At the outset , in fact , it is necessary that we treat a word in terms of its Syntactically Related Words  ( SRW )  . In a given text , each word bears a given syntactic relationship to a finite number of other words  ; e . g . , a finite number of words ( nouns and pronouns ) appear as " subject " for each active verb ; another group of nouns and pronouns are used as " direct object " of each transitive verb  ; other words of the class , " adverb , " appear as modifiers of a given verb . In each instance we may speak of the related words as SRW of a given verb  , so that in our example three different ~ of SRW emerge  ; a given SRW is then defined in terms both of word class and specific relationship to the verb  .   ( A given noun may of course belong to two different types of SRW  , e . g . , as both subject and object of the same verb . ) Distributionally , we may compare two verbs in terms of their SRN . The objective of the present study is to test the premise that " similar " words tend to have the same SRW  . This premise is tested , not with verbs , as in the l , arper above example , but with nouns . Our procedure is ( i ) to find in a given text three types of SRW for a small group of nouns  , (2) to find the number of Sill ; T shared by each pair of nouns formed from the group  , and ( 3 ) to express the " similarity " between in div idual nouns  ) and groups of nouns , as a function of their shared SRI ~ . Another example : it might turn out that in ag iven text the nouns " a " and " b "  ( " avocado " and " cherry " ) share such adjective modifiers as " ripe , " whereas nouns " c ) ' and " d " ( " chair " and " furniture " ) have in common the adjective modifier " modern  . " These facts would lead us to conclude that " a " and " b " are simi-lar  , that " c " and " d " are similar ) that " a " and " c " are less similar , etc . 
A number of questions arise : What is " simi larity " anyway ? Do words that are simila r in meaning really share a significant number of SRW in a given text ? What is " as ignificant number "? Do not dissimilar words also have many common SRW?flow much text is necessary in order to estab-lish pat terns of word behavior ? What is the effect of multiple = meaning in words  , and of using , texts from differ=ent subject areas ? The present investigation should be regarded as an experiment designed to throw some light on these questions  ; no validity is claimed for the " result s " obtained  . Our audacity in attempting the experiment a tall is based on three factors : the possess ion of a text in a limited field  ( physics )   , the foreknowledge that the multiple = lla rper  3 meaning probler : lismin in lal , and the capability for automatic process ing of text  . ( The latter is clearly a necessity , in view o ? the size and complexity of the problem  .   ) The reader may well conclude that the exper iment proves nothing  . 
We would hope , however , that such an opinion would not preclude acr itical judgment of the procedures employed  , or the suspension of d is belief if the resu lts do not correspond with his expect at ions  . 
2. PROCIiDIIRI'\]
Tile present study was based on a series of ar ticles from Russian physics journals  , comprising approximately 120 ) 000 running words ( some 500 pages )   . The process in p , of this te . xt has been described elsewhere , (1'2) ltere , we note only that each sentence of this text i s recorded on magnetic tape  , together with the following information fo reach occurrence in the sentence : its part of speech  , its " word number " ( an identification number in the machine g lossary  , and its syntactic " governor " or " dependent  "   ( i ? any ) in the sentence . A retrieval program applied to this text tape then yielded information about the SRI ' i for words in which we were interested  . For convenience and economy , all words in the machine print out for this study are identified by word number  , rather than in their " natural-language " ? or v  )  . 
In our study we chose to deal wit\]~theSRI ~ of forty Russian nouns  , here in called Test ~ ords TW ) . The number ltarper 4 is completely arbitrary ; tile particular nouns chosen ( see Table 1 ) a ' ere presumed to form different semanticg roupings  . 
Table 1 gives one possible grouping of these words ; the criteria for grouping are more or less obvious  , although the reader may easily form diffe rent groups  , by expanding or contracting the groups that we have designated  . The only purpose of grouping is to provide a weak measure of control in the experiment : i f two nouns are found to be similar in terms of their SRN  , we should like to compare this finding wi th some intuitive understanding of their similarity  . ( For convenience , we shall refer to the ' rWs by their Engl is hequivalents  .   ) Two nouns may be compared with reference to several dif-ferent types of SRW  . ilere , we have chosen to iimit our comparison to th reetypes : t  . te adjective dependents ( in either attributive or predicative function  )   , the noun depend . ents ( normally , but not necessarily , in the genitive case in Russian ) , and the noun governors ( the TN is nor-mally , but not necessarily , in tile genitive case ) . Strictly speaking , the syntactic function of the SRIq should be taken into account  . In ignoring this factor , we are consciously permitting certain inexactitudes  , on the premise that the distortions in t roduced into measurement will not be severe  . 
The task of manualiy retrieving SRW for each occurrence of the  40 TWs , and of comparing each TW with every other TW , is too tedious to be attempted . The aid of the computer was enlisted , in two ways , llar per 5

A listing is produced for each of the TWs ( see Table 2 , " SRW Detail , " for an example of the TW , VYCISLENIE = calculation 1) , showing tile different words used as adjective dependents  ( Listi )  , noun dependents ( List 2) , and noun governors ( List3) . Tile number of words on each of these lists is also shown in Table i  , together with the total number of SRW for each TW  ( List 4 )  . We stress the fact that these numbers refer to different words used as SRW  ; the repetition of a given SRW ( for a given SRW type ) was not recorded . 
2 . Each Tl~was automatically compared with every other TW  , with respect to their shared SRW , i . e . , in terms of the words i ~ Lists I ,  2 , and 3 of the " SRW Detail Listing . " A new listing , " Similarity Ranking by T % ~' , " is then produced ( see Table 3 for the T ~ , VYCISLENIE = calculation l) . This listing shows for each TW the number of shared SRW of each of the three types  ( NI , N2 , and N3 , Table 3) , the total number of shared SR % ~( NA ) , and a measure of similarity for the pairs , here in designated as the Similarity Coefficient ( SC )  . The SC is a decimal fraction obtained by dividing the sum of shared SRW for each pair of TWs by the product of the frequencies of the two TWs  .

I iarper 9 of the TWs ; other means for determining this coefficient can be utilized  . ) The pairings for each TW are ordered on the value of the SC  . It should be noted that the similarity between TWs is measured in terms of the total number of shared SRW  ( Column NA of Table 3 )  ; it is also possible to express this measurement in terms of shared SRW of any single type  . 
A third listing was also produced : a listing of the  7  , ~I)TI~'-pairs , ordered oll the value of the SC . This listing , not reproduced here because of its length , will be referred to as " Ranking of TW-Pairs by SC ~  . "' Fable 4 shows the distribution of the SC as compared with tile number of TW pairs  . 
The following discussion is based on the three listings described above  . A few additional remarks may be made about the procedure itself  , which may be likened to deep-seafishing with a teast rainer full of holes  . The limitations of size are obvious : we have limited ourselves to three of the numerous ways of comparing nouns in terms of their SRW  . Other types of SRW that suggest themselves are : verbs j where TW is subject  ; verbs , where TW is direct object ; prepositional phrases as dependents , or governors , of TW ; nouns joined to TW through coordinate conjunctions  ( i . e . , " apples " and " grapes " are said to be more similar if " apples and oranges " and " grapes and oranges " occur in text  )  . Some of the holes in our teast rainer are : the neglect of the case of the noun dependent of TW  , or the ' Liarp or i0---' tq ' . ~ .

In view of these deficiencies ( not to mention the problem of statisti cs  )   , the success of our fishing expedition is open to doubt  . Let us then proceed to examine the catch . 
3. RI ! SULTS
The evaluation of the data contained in our th ree machine list in ~  . s is not an easy task . We can scarcely examine and discuss the degrees of sir  . ~ ilarity of 780 noun-pairs . The problem of interpretation is also compl icated : how completely and accurately should the results corres-pond with our expect at ions  , as represented in the tentative semantic group ings  ( Table 1 ) ? Our approach is to deal in a summary manner with the noun-pairs characterized by highest Similarity Coefficients  , especially with respect to their intra-and intergroup relationships  . Before proceeding to this discussion , a few preliminary remarks should be made about the data in the various machine listings  . 
The summary of SRW counts for each TW , contained in Table I , suggests all TWs do not have the same opportunity for comparison  . In the case of " correspondence " ( Group 3) , tlarper 12 a total of only three SRW is noted in ( Column 14 )  ; as a result , this TW should be eliminated from furt Jler consideration  . In addition , unless at least two , and preferably all three , types of SRW are well represented for a given TW , the SC for that noun will tend to be skewed . As examples , we note all nouns in Croup 6 ( for which the 1 , 3 column predominates ) , and the nouns in Group lO ( for which the L2 column predominates )   . In effect , these nouns are " deficient " in certain types of SRI  ; ' , and require special handling . 
, t On the pr in tout , " Ranking of Tl~-Pairs by SC , a number of noun pairs appear at the top end of the scale although the total number of shared SRW is small  ( i . e .   , the value of colurn n " NA " ( see Table 4 ) is "1 ,  " "~ ,  . , " or "3 . " The SC may be high , because the product of the frequencies is re latively low  . Our policy has been to discount these pai rs on the grounds that the value of " NA " iss ignificant in determining the similar i ty between two TWs  . The minimum value for NA was arbitrarily set at four  . 
Keeping in mind the seanmndations to the data in mind  , We proceed to the discussion of the noun-pai rs character-ized by highest S  ( : . Table 3 shows the distribution of 5 ( 2 by noun-pairs . By any standard , the data shows nega-tive or extremely weaks imilarity for most of the  780 pairs .

At which point on the curves hallwed rawaline , saying that an SC above this value indicates similarity  , a ~ d that an SC below this value indicates dissimilarity or weak similarity  ( all this of course : in terms of r cliability ) ? For purposes of discussion , we propose to set the t\]~reshold at . 00100--a rigorously high figure . After eliminating pairs whose NA value is less than  4  , we find 38 p , ~ irs whose SC lies in the range . 00100 to . 01~337 ( Table 5) . ( Z\],e first two zeroes are dropped . ) The reader may draw his own conclusions about the degree of similarity between the nouns in any given pairing  . For purposes of discussion , we will refer to the pairings in terms of our preliminary groupings  ( Table I )  . 
The following intra - and inter-Group pairings are observed in Table  5 : Nouns of Group 1 pair with nouns of Group I , 22I ,  2 , i054 ,  5 ,  6 ,  7 6 5 ,  6 ,  7 5 , 7 i0 2 , I0 ii 5 , I i We note that no pairings appear for nouns of Groups  3 and 8  . All other groups except Group 4 are represented by intragroup pairings ; to this degree , our expectations are fulfilled , i . e . , the data supports our a priori feelings for the similarity between words  .

Iiltarper 15 group pairing may indicate either that the data is inconclusive  , or that our original groupings were too narrow . 
In fact , two larger groups emerge : one composed of Groups  1 and 2   ( perhaps including Group 1O )  , the other composed of Groups 4 ,  5 ,  6 , and 7 . This tendency is more marked if we lower the SC threshold from  . 00100 to . 00070 , thereby adding a total of 28 pairs to the number listed in Table 5  . For example , nouns of Group 1 are found to pair with those of Group 10  , and nouns of Group 4 pair with those of Groups 6 and 7  . 
The data is not statistically conclusive , but strongly suggests the emergence of the two major groups mentioned above  . The amalgamation of Groups 1 and 2 can easily be defended on semantic grounds ; since Group 10 , as noted above , is subject to a berrant behavior ( because of the very high number of noun dependents  )  , its interrelation with Groups 1 and 2 may not be taken seriously . Groups 4 ,  5 ,  6 , and 7 , which include the names of chemical mixtures , classes of elements , individual elements , and components of elements , may be taken together semantically as a single subclass of " object nouns  . " The physicist tends to say the same things about all nouns in this group  . 
One of tile 38 pairs listed in Table 5 appears to contradict expectation : " liquid "/ "problem"  ( Groups 5 and Ii )  . 
It should also be noted that the noun dependents of Group  i0 nouns servea " subjective " rather than " objective " function  . If we had distinguished between the syntactic function of the noun dependent  , TWs of Group I0 would be only weakly similar to TWs of Groups 1 and 2  .

Tilefour SRW shared by those two nouns include the adjective " certain " and the noun governor " number  . " The non-discrim-inatory ( " promiscuous " ) nature of these two SRW is perhaps obvious , and one of the refine laents that should be intro-duced in future studies is the neg lect of such words as " significant " SRI  ~  .   ( Tile study of " promiscuity " in adjec-ti vesis referred to in Reference  4  . ) At the present , experience suggests that distortions in t roduced by such words are minimal if the number of SRW is sufficiently large  . 
Our general conclusion is that , with a few anomalies , the 66 pairings for which the SCIs . 00700 or higher meet with our expcctations . 
Another aspect of the question remains : many nouns with presumed similarity arc not represented on the high end of the SC distribution curve  .   ( If we lower the threshold to include such pairs we shall also encounter many non-similar pairs  . ) One way of dealing with this problem is to consider the most highly correlated pairs that nouns in each Group form  , whether or not the SC is " significantly " high . In lieu of presenting this information in full detail  , we show in Table 6 the most closely correlated pairs for a representative noun from each of the Groups  ( excepting Groups 3 ,  4 , and 8) . 
The most striking aspect of Table 6 is the repetition of intra - and inter-Group pairings noted in Table S for high-SC pairings  . In other words , the relative value of

This result was certainly not expected , and perhaps indi-cates a greater sensitiv ity in our measurement procedures than we would have thought reasonable  . 
Table 6 suggests , but does not prove , the existence of clusters ( or " clumps " ) of T~s , in which the members are closely correlated with each other  , and in which no member is closely correlated to any outside word  . lee have not yet attempted to apply clumping procedures  ; a better understanding of the data is perhaps a prerequisite to this rigorous treatment  . For the present , we shall point out a phenomenon that strongly suggests the existence of clumps : the recurrence of the same SRI~~among several TWs with high mutual correlation  . Consider , for example , that a high 5C is found between Test Words A and B ) B and C , and A and C ;  if , in addition , a relatively high proportion of SRW are shared by all three Tl~s  , the mutual connection of the three words would appear to be considerably strength-ened  . The recurrence of SRW has not been systematica lly studied  ) but the following sample is offered as an illus-tration of the phenomenon  . Below , we list all the SRW of the three types , for the \]' I~calculation 1 . The under-lined words are those which , in addition , also served as corresponding SRI ; ~ for two other T ; is ( determination , and measurement ) that are highly correlated to each other and to calculation  1  .

Table 7 shows that eighteen SRW appeared for calcula tion IOf these  , one half ( nine ) also appeared as SRW for both determination and measurement  . It would seem that the " togetherness " of these three TWs is strengthened by this feature  , which we term " recurrence of SR ; V . " We have no ready formula for determining that recurrence is or is not significant in a given situation  . In general , the nature and behavior of individual SRIV remain to be studied  , so far as their relevance to our problem is concerned  . 
4. CONCLUSIONS
We conclude that there is considerable agreement between the results of our experiment and an a priori feeling for the similarity of words  . Words that are similar in meaning tend to have the same SRI'  , ' t to a far greater degree than chance would determine  . If this conclusion is valid , a largescale experiment is suggested , using a larger number of Test Words , more SRW types , and a larger tlarper 20 amount of text .
