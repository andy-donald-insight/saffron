This paper reports on the results of an evaluation we have performed on the Grammar Checker for Norwegian  ( NGC )  , developed at The Text Laboratory , University of Oslo . The NGC is now part of Microsoft Word in the Office XP package released in  2001  .  The goal of the NGC was decided partly by that of the Swedish Grammar Checker  ( SGC , Arppe 2000 and Birn 2000) , designed to detect what were assumed to be the errors of ? standard ? users  , and partly by a wish to include more linguistically advanced features  . The kind of grammatical mistakes made by linguistically ?  non-standard?3 groups was not taken into account , and this kind of tool obviously would be beneficial to these groups  . 
Having provided an overview of the main method behind the NGC  , we will give a general overview of the kinds of errors that the NGC is designed to detect  . Then we will show how it performs on various deviant language input

Like the SGC the NGC has three main parts in addition to an initial tokenizer  ( spellchecking is performed at a previous stage ) :  A morphological analyser ( NOBTWOL )  , which provides each word form with all of its lexically possible readings  ( grammatical tags )  . 
 A morphological CG disambiguator , which eliminates incorrect tags according to the grammatical context  ( Karlsson et . al 1995 , Hagen , Johannessen and N?klestad 2000a and 2000b) . 
 An error detector that identifies different kinds of grammatical errors  . 

There is an interesting problem regarding the construction of a grammar checker  . On the one hand it is necessary to have as much grammatical information as possible about the particular text that is going to be checked  . On the other hand , it is very difficult to perform any such grammatical analysis  , since grammatical features ( ? errors ? ) essential for the analysis might be missing . We tried to solve the problem by relaxing many of the requirements of the disambiguating tagger described above  , since it was originally developed for grammatically correct texts  . An example of this is the original CG rule assigning a determiner reading to a word that is next to a noun and agrees with it in number and gender :  ( 01 )   ( @ w = ! ( detneut )   ( 0 DEF-DET )   ( *1 DEF-SG-NEUT-NOUN * L )   ( NOTLR0NOT-ADJ-NOUN * L )   ( NOT*LNOT-ADV-ADJ ) )
The rule ( one of approximately 2000 rules ) says that if a word is definite and has neuter determiner as one of its readings  , but there is a neuter definite singular noun to its right  , with nothing but adverbs and adjectives in between  , then the determiner reading is correct . 
This rule ensures that the first word in the sentence below is correctly tagged as a determiner and note  . g . a pronoun :   eple tlikte hangod t the . DEF . NEUTER . SG apple . DEF . NEUTER . SG liked he well ? That apple , heliked well . ? The tagger can then safely assume that whatever does not agree with the noun to its right is not part of the same noun phrase  , and therefore is a pronoun . However , a   can never assume that anything is correct  , and cannot rely on the agreement features of the determiner and the noun  . Instead , it ought to be able to detect any missing agreement and point out the error  . So the new relaxed tagger leaves more ambiguity . Instead , very specific error rules are introduced in the NGC  . Rule ( 03 ) below ( one of 700 error rules ) detects gender disagreement between a determiner and the following noun  ( 04 )  . 
(03 )   ( @ w = s ! ( @ERR )   ( 0 DET-DEF-NEUT )   ( NOT-1 DITRANS )   ( 1 CNOUN-SG-DEF )   ( NOT 1NEUT )   ( 1 MASC ) )  ( 04 ) * Jent as ? det bilen The . girl saw the . DEF . NEUT . SG car . DEF . MASC . SG ' The girl saw that car . ' This method is reminiscent of that suggested by Schneider and McCoy  ( 1998 ) for their ICICLE system designed to help second -language learners of English  . However , since theirs is a grammar based on contextfree rules  , it is more difficult to implement ; in order for a parse to be successful , all phrases have to be wellformed , which means that the grammar must include rules for ungrammatical structures  . CG has an advantage ; it does not have to build a full phrase structure  , thus partial parses are fine , and local errors are easily detected . 

The NGC detects the following main error types :  Noun phrase internal agreement :

The recall rate for the NGC has not been calculated  . 
The figures above were calculated on the basis of texts written by advanced language users-mostly Norwegian and Swedish journalists  , with few errors in each text . Most of the errors were not due to lack of knowledge of Norwegian grammar  , but rather to modern word processing : too quick use of functions like cut and paste  , insert etc . For example , two finite modal verbs next to each other would not be uncommon  . However , one would assume that less linguistically advanced users might benefit more from this kind of tool  . In the next sections we shall evaluate the NGC on texts produced by various nonstandard language users  .

More specifically , we have tested the
NGC on essays written by Norwegian deaf pupils ( 1115 years old ) and four groups of foreign university students in Norway  ( Slav and Chinese students on Level II ( Intermediate ) and Level III ( Advanced )  . We have included papers written by a control group of Norwegian pupils  , as the student essays were handwritten and the initial precision of the NGC was calculated on word-processed texts  . We will also test the NGC on essays written by dyslexic and aphasic adults  . 

There is not enough space to give the individual test results here  . Let us instead illustrate with one group , the Chinese intermediate students . 
There were 15 essays of an average of 300 words , altogether 4500 words , the same amount as for the other test groups . The vast majority of the detected errors are morphological ones  , see table ( 05 ) :  ( 05 ) Errors detected by the NGC for Chinese Level II stud  .

In addition to the 32 errors detected by the NGC , the Chinese Level II students made 228 errors that were not detected by the NGC , i . e . only 12% were found . But notice that nearly half the errors ( 115 ) are lexical , idiomatic and pragmatic ones ? error types that have not even been attempted to be detected by the NGC  .

It can also be improved by adding more morphological rules  . 
This is similar to the error pattern of all the other nonstandard language groups we have studied so far  ( Chinese Level III students , two levels of Slav students and deaf Norwegian pupils  )  . The NGC finds 10% of the total number of errors in the essays written by Slav students  . 
For the deaf students , the NGC findings rise slightly , to 14% . A reason for the higher percentage could be that the deaf pupils make many morphological mistakes  , a feature the NGC is designed to detect . For example , these pupils typically use nonfinite verb forms and wrong gender for nouns  . 

Like the Chinese students , both the
Slavs and the deaf pup ils have a very high percentage of ? non-grammatical ? errors  , i . e . , lexical , idiomatic and pragmatic . The non-grammatical errors of the Slav students amount to  60% of all errors , while the number for the deaf pupils is 52% . 

However , there are also big differences between the groups  , see table (12) below . For example , the foreign language students have fewer idiomatic and pragmatic errors than the deaf pupils  ( 20% of all errors versus 31% )  . This aspect is even more striking when we look at the pragmatic errors only  . The Slav students have only 4% pragmatic errors ( of all errors )  . The Chinese students have a higher number ; 9% . The deaf students , however , have 22% pragmatic errors .

The deaf students especially make two kinds of pragmatic errors : wrong choice of definiteness on the basis of given/new information  , and wrong use of tense ( typically a change of tense when none is called for  )  . 
Related to this is the morphological kind of error mentioned above : lack of finiteness on verbs  . 
These numbers , though interesting , are hardly surprising ; to some extent they reflect the linguistic background of these language users  . 
The Norwegian Sign Language and Chinese have no morphological verb marking or noun marking  , while Slavic languages have a complex system of verb inflection  . 

The results for the Norwegian control group are predictable  . They make no non-grammatical mistakes , few grammatical mistakes 4 , and frequently split compounds incorrectly .   16% of their errors were found by the NGC ? slightly higher than the number for the other test groups  , but much lower than the equivalent number of the SGC wich was reported to be  35%   ( Birn 2000 ) in Swedish newspaper texts . Obviously , the reason for the lower number is that the essays by the Norwegian pupils are originally written by hand  , and thus lack easily detectable cut-and-paste and our word-processing errors  . Our ongoing research will show us the results for the other " nonstandard " language groups  . 

The NGC gives surprisingly few ? false alarms ? ( the precision is 95% , as opposed to 75% for the newspaper texts ) in the texts by nonstandard language groups , due to the fact that their language is very simple  , suiting the shallow analysis performed by the NGC  . The precision for the Norwegian control group is also high:  87%  . 

With a larger-scale error analysis of authentic texts from the nonstandard groups a lot of new knowledge could be found  , which would make a good basis for improving the NGC  . More specifically , since morphological and syntactic features are governed by sentence-internal rules  , a rule-based grammar checker like the NGC notoriously difficult because the pronunciation is the same  ) should be able to account for violations of such features  . 
In fact , we have done some testing for this purpose , and developed rules for 14 new morphological and syntactic error types5  . One new feature is the detection of compound words erroneously written as two separate words  (  ? cancer studies ? instead of      )  . 
The results are promising : The overall recall for morphological errors for our Chinese students now increased from  38% to 53%  . 
Detection of non-grammatical errors is more difficult to improve  . Of course , with an advanced lexicon containing e . g . detailed subcategorisation information , we might be able to find some lexical errors , such as certain prepositions after certain verbs . On the other hand , a lexicon instead of context , since something which looks like a subcategorised category may in fact be something else  . 
Idiomatic expressions are more of a problem , but given a large error corpus , it would be possible to extract the most common error types and look for these later  . Pragmatic errors are notoriously difficult . But even here , it would be possible to use some system to alarm the user whenever  , for example , a singular count noun occurs without a determiner or two verbs have different tense in the same sentence  . 

The Norwegian Grammar Checker was made for native Norwegian speakers  . We have tested the NGC on texts written by " nonstandard " language users  ( Slav and Chinese students of Norwegian , and Norwegian native deaf pupils ) . 
It turned out that a high percentage , as much as 8590% , of their mistakes remained undetected . 
However , the picture is not quite as bleak as it might seem  , since the majority of the errors ,  5060% , were " non-grammatical " , i . e . lexical , idiomatic and pragmatic , errors which the NGC was not designed to detect . 

Does this mean that a grammar checker is of no help for these groups ? We do not think so  ; 4050% of the errors were grammatical , i . e . subject with the project AGrammar Checker for Users with Special Needs  , headed by Torbj?rn Nordg?rdat NTNU . 
to sentence-internal linguistic rules . Since the NGC is rule-based , it should be possible to account for many of these kinds of errors  . 
Indeed , preliminary tests indicate that this is the case .
