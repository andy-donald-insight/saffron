Abstract
In this paper , we discuss the phenomenon of logical polysemy in natural anguage as ~ ddressed by Generative Lexicon Theory  . We discuss generally the role of type and sortal coercion operations in the selnantics  , and specifically the conditions on the application of coercion in aspectual predicates and other contexts  . 
We reply to some recent discussion regarding the use of coercion in the grammar  , and show that type changing operations are both useful and explanatory mechanisms for capturing linguistic and computatioimlg clleraliza  . tions . 
1 Introduction
Recently , work in computational semantics and lexical semantics has made an interesting shift  . 
Motivated by a concern for lexical organization and global coherence in tl~estructure of the language lexicon  , some researchers ha , w~moved towards more expressive semantic descriptions  ( \[16 ,  1 ,  5 ,  101) , as well a . smore powerful methods of composition (\[22, 3\]) . 
Some , however , have expressed reservations a . s to the general applicability of type-changing operation such as coercion  , as well as the notion of a generative lexicon itself  ( \[7\] )  . In this pa . per , we address the sec . riticisms directly , and show that , upon closer examination of the data , these critiques either miss the . point or are not substantiated by the data . Still , without a proper notion of constraints on coercion  , there can indeed be overgeneration fforms a . nd interpretations in the semantics , and in fact , the notion of conditions on coercion has always been integral to the basic spirit of Generative Lexicon Theory  ( el ' . 
\[19\]) . The empirical study of the range and limits of type change and cocomposition operations in natural anguage is an essentia  . lpart of the research in formals mnantics . The advantages accompanying elmrative mechanisnls and the characterization of languages as lmly morphic in well-defined ways far outweight the explanatory in-adequacies inherent in traditional approaches to lexical design and semantic projection  , what \[22\] have called word sense enumeration approaches . 
2 Polymorphic Languages and
Semantic Expressiveness
We will a , ssulnes ( 3me geueraJ familiarity with the framework of generative lexicon theory  , as outlined in\[16 ,  18 ,  1\] . ~' e feel it is important , however , to clarify the motivating principles and gen-era . l methodology behind SllChwork , since these points seem to be overlooked or misunderstood by some authors  ( \[7\] )  . 
In order to help characterize the generative power of natura  . l languages in terms of semantic expressiveness , it is natural to think in terms of senla . ntic systenls with increasing functional power , l : urthel ' more , a natura . Iwa . y of Cal ) turing this might be in terms of the type system which the gra  . mm a refers to for its interl ) retation . It has been argued elsewhere (\[19 ,  20\]) , that there are reasons for describing how semantic systems fall on a hierarchy of increasing expressive power  . 
It seems clear at this point that the current enu -mera  . tiw ~ . techniques for lexical description are too impoverished to adequately describe the richness of semantic da  . ta , much less to explain either how word senses relate to one a  . to the ror the creative use of wo , ' dsi . , , over , : o . text sllrieily , a . genera . tiw ', lexicon can be characterized as a syste . nlinvolving at least the tbllowing four levels of re  . presentations : Argument Strut1;nre , Event Structul'e , Qnalia . Structnre , and I , ex-ical Inheritance Structure . A set of generative devices connects these \[ bur lew ~ qs  , providing l br the compositional interpret a . tioll of words in context . 
The exact nature of these devices will determine infa  , irly delinite ways . The best st . u(lied illustra-tion of this is the phenomet , on of ::+\] p + + coc ? ' cio ? + , but it , is by no mea . ns the only one .

Namely , the homomorphic rela . tion between the NP type ( mass vs . count ) gives rise to i ) rocess and transition interpretations of event structures  ( corresponding roughly to the amorl ) housand bounded readings resi ) ectively , of ( k ) ( lar(\[andaa yez's analysis ) . 
If it is truly an expla . na . tory and productive operation , coercion should be trot just a property of object phr~tses  , but affecf the semantic inter--pretation of subjects and other positions a  , swell ( cf .  \[17\]) . For exan , ple , the interpretation o'psychological predicates uchasill  ( 5 ) involves ainetonymic reconstruction of the subject as a  . ne . xperiencing event .

Contrary to Godard and Ja . yez's claim , all of the above examples indicate very clearly a subject event reaming  ; i . e . , ~ va(ling books , watching the movie , see in qMary's face , and listening to her chatter , as argued in \[ J6\] . With examples such as * The book bcga'n last week  , however , coere on is not possible for ra . ther trivial reasons ; nalnely , as a violation o1'control . It is , by tileway , not surprising to lind asymmetries between argument positions  . Anaphora . , control , and extraction from subject position all behave differently from argument positions within VP  . The point is that linguistic evidences upl ) or ts an underlying semantic type , directly explaining what the connection between the subject and object of the experiencing relation is  . in\[17 , the un ( ler-lying semantics of psychological predicates uc has bore  , anger , and frighten is a causatives truelure where the surfa  . ee subject is the logical object of an experiencing relation  . For example , the event structure for the verb an . q cr hastire t bllow-ing form :\[ PTx p(el , x , y)A~\])(er , y ) A ang ' ry(e2 , y ) A ~ e . 2-<q\]>cau , se(c'l , c2 ) The qualia structure projected by the NP cow tributes relational information as to just wha  . tmanner of experiencing is in w ) lved . Short of general world knowledge , how are we to infer the 1) t~r-titularma . nmu ' in which Mary be came bored in ( 4b ) ? By knowing what a . movie is , we know how to use it and experience it ; this is the defining role of tire qua Jia structure  . And yet , to claim that the qualia are a useful representation  ( which C , o-darda . ndJayez admit ) , with ont exploiting them through type reconstruction operations  ( e . g . coercion ) , is to fail to see the logical relations be ~ tWeell lexical senses a  . nd derived senses in tile language . It is as though we were to i ) ermit traces illour granuna . tical formalism without having a . 
statement of binding , or otherwise knowing what to do with them . 
The third argunent a ga . inst (: oer cive opera . -tions involves exa . mple such as along novel and a bright bulb . These . are to be contrasted with a red book and a , io paque bulb . As pointed out in \[21\] , the adjectives here modify a distinguished event predicate  ( i . e . a quale ) associated with tile head , rcad for book , a ~ t dilh , min . a t c t b r b u l b .

" . Johnhought along novel . " tha . t this is a . counterexample to type coercion . 
But this surely misinterprets what role the adjective is playing in tile semantics  . As already argued very explicitly in\[22\] , the modification by an adjective such as long , rclpide(J?tsl ) , or brillant ( bright ) , is a submodification on the al ) propriate qualia of the head .
