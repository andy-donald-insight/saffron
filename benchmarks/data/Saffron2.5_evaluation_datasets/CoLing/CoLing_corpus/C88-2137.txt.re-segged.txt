L ) ~ ntroduction
The Dh'ect Memoiy Access ( DMA ) paradign r has been re . -searched as a new model fox ' naturalanguage processing  ( Riesl~eck & M~fin\[1985\] and Riesbeck\[1986\] , Tomabechi-\[1987 a\]) . h this paradigm , natural anguage understanding is viewed a ; an effort to recognize input sentences by using p ~ c-cxisting knowledge in memory  , which is often experien . -tialaud cpi :; odic . It is contrasted with traditional models of parsing in which syntactic and semantic representations it rebuilt as the result of parsing and are normally lost after each parse  . In the DMA model , input sentences are identified with the memorys U ' ucture which represents he input  , and are in-stantiatcd to represent flint specific input  . Since understanding is performed as recognition through theme moly network  , the result of understanding is ~ aot lost after each sentence is processed  . Also , since parsing and memory-based inferences are integrated  , ~arious memory ~ based activities emt be triggered directly through natural language understanding without separate inferential processes  . 
As on ~' application of DMA , at the Center for Machine " l?anslatioil ( CMT ) at Carnegie Mellon University , we have developed a natucal anguage interface for our largescale knowledge-based machine translation system t called DM-  ( ~ OMMAND . This application of DMA demonstrates the power of this m  ( ~ lcl , since direct access to memory during parsing allows dyna  , ~dc evaluation of input commands and question an ~ ~ we ~ ing without running separate inferential processes  , while dynanfic ~ d~yutilizing the MT system's already existing do-  , ~ lahl 13~owlcdge sonrces ~ The implementation f the DMA a T tt e CM!3-MT syst c in which is the target system fo~tic DMo COiV ~ r ? ~ AND sy:~tem described in this paper is described in detail in  Tomita-&Cmbtmell\[1987\] and Mitamufa , eta/t1988\] . 
natural anguage system has been completed and is used for development of actual grammars  , domain knowledge bases , and syntax/semantic mapping rules by the researchers at CMT  . 
This system has been demonstrated to be highly effective as a MT developmental support system  , since researchers who develop these individual knowledge sources are otherwise un-knowledgeable about the internal implementation f the MT system  . The DMA natural anguage interface can provide access  ( currently English and Japanese ) to the system's internal functions through natural anguage command and query inputs  . This use of the DMA model for natural language iw terfaces demonstrates that it is an effective alternative to other natural language interface schemes  . 
II . A background of DMA
The Direct Memoly Access method of parsing originated in  Quillian~s\[1968\] notion of semantic memory , which was nsed in his TLC ( Quillian\[1969\] ) which led to furthere search in semantic network -based processing  2  . TLC used breadth-first spreading marker-passing as an intersection search of two lexically pointed nodes in a semantic memory  , leaving interpretation of text as an intersection of the paths  . Thus , interpretation of input text was directly performed on semantic memory  . Although TLC was the first DMA system , DMA had not been explored as a model of parsing until the  DMAP0 system of Riesbeek & Martin , except as a scheme for disambiguations . 
I ) M AP0 used a guided marker-passing algorithm to avoid the problem of an explosion of search paths  , from which a dumb 3 ( not guided ) marker passing mechanism inherently suffers . 
DMAP0 used P~markers ( Prediction markers ) and A-markers ( Activation markers ) as markers passed around in memory , adopting the notion of concept sequence to represent linear ordering of concepts as linguistic knowledge  , which guides linear predictions of concepts ending P-markers in memory  .

Likewise , the direct memory access recognition of a question means that the concept which is identified by the input is directly connected to the concep that represents he answer  , as long as the system knows ( or potentially knows ) the answer . In oilier words , in the DMA model , recognition of a request for action is a triggering of the action requested and recognition of a question is knowing the answer  ( i . e . , as soon as we understand the question , either we know the answer , or we know the inferences to be performed ( or functions to be evaluated ) to get the answer ) as long as memory contains the action and the answer  . ' l breiterate the literature on the DMA paradigm  , in this model , memory is organized in the hierarchical network of concepts which are related by links that define the concepts  . Thus , as soon as we identify the input with a certain concept in the memory  , we can trigger the action ( if this is a concept that represents some action ( or request for action ) ) , or answer the question ( if the concept represents some knowledge ( or request for some knowledge ) ) . Thus , parsing and inference are integrated in the memory search process  , and no separate inferential modules are necessary  . It should be understood ; however , that it is not our claim that we can eliminate inference altogether  . Our claim is that 1 ) the memory search through concept refinement itself is an inference which is normally performed by separate inference modules -  ( such as e ontexual inference and discourse analyses modules  ) in other parsing paradigm ; and 2) whenever further inference is necessary , such inference can be directly triggered after concept refinement from the result of parse  ( for example , as a daemon stored in the abstraction of the refined concept  ) and therefore , the inference is integrated in the memory activity  . 
C . Ellisps is and anaphora
In a practical natural language interface , the capacity to handle elliptic and anaphorie x pressions i important  . DM-COMMAND is capable of handling these phenomena  , because under the DMA paradigm ( which is typically called " recognize-and-record paradigm "  )  , the result of each parse is not lost after each sentence  , but instead remains as part of the contexual knowledge in the memory network  . On the other hand , in the traditional parsing paradigm ( we call it " build-and ~ store " paradigm )  , since the result of the parse is lost after each sentence  , the parsers can at best handle in dexicality within a sentence  . Specifically , 1) ellipses are handled by DM-CoMMAND ; since ellipses are characterized as the lack of elements in a concept sequence  , and these are recoverable as long as the elements or their descendants had been activated in previous  parsesl4  ;  2 ) anaphoric and pronoun references are ~4For example , with the input " jgt 92 . graouchidase , sem . tstmo . " ( Print jgr 92 . gra . Sem . tstalso ) . Seconds enteuce has the object droped ; however , resolved by utilization of both semantic knowledge  ( repre- . 
sented as restrictions on possible types of resolutions  ) and also by the context left from the previous parses in memory similar to the way  , that heelliptic expressions am handled . 
Finding a contexually salient NP corresponding to so tr~eNP means  , in DMA , searching for a concept in memory which is previously activated and can be contexually substit ~ tefox ' currently active concept sequence tSo 
DoDMA and syntax
One weakness of current implementations of th ~ If ) MA paradigm is that the concept sequence is the sole syntactic knowledge for parsing  16  . Therefore , a DMA system needs deliberate preparation of concept sequences to handle syntactically complex sentences  ( uc has deeply embedded clauses ~ small cauls , many types of sentential djuncts , etc . ) . This does not mean that it is incapable of handling syntactically complex sentences  , instead it means that concept sequences at some level of abstraction  ( at syntactic template lvel down to phrasal lexicon  ( Becker\[1975\] ) level ) must be prepared for each type of complex sentence  . In other words , although such sentences can be handled by the combination of concept sequences  , designing such sequences can be complex and less general than using external syntactic knowledge  17  . Thus , current reliance upon a linear sequence of concepts causes limitations on the types of sentences that can be realistically handled in DM -COMMAND  . Of course , there is nothing to prevent DMA paradigm to integrate syntactic knowledge othea'thana linear sequence of concepts  . Actually , we have already implemented two alternative schemes for integrating phrase-structure rules into DMA  . One method we used was having syntactic nodes as part of the memory and writing phrase-structure rules as concept sequences  18  . Another method was to integrate the DMA memory activity into an augnrnented contextfree grammar unification i a generalized LR parsing  . 
Second method used in a continuous speech understanding is described in Tomabeetti & Tomita \ [ ms\]  . We will not discuss these schemes in this paper . 
While handling syntactically complex sentences i rather expensive for DM-COMMAND  , since it relies solely on linear concept sequences  , natural language interfaces are one appli-tiffs can be supplied since the memory activity after the first sentence is ~ ot lost and the memory can supply the missing object  . 
15 Furexample in " Pretty-printdm . lisp . Send it to mt @ . nr ' ~" it " can be identified with the concept in memory that represents d in  . lisp which was activated in memory during the understanding of the first sentence  . 
t ~ Although eneration is normally helped by external syntactic kato wl-edges nc has in file case of DM'I'RANS  . 
17 Also , pronoun and anaphora resolution is based upon contexual knowledge alone  ; however , use of syntactic knowledge ( such as ritegoverning category of an anaphora ) would help such efforts .

It seems that DMA is one ideal paradigm in this axe ao This is evident if we consider the fact that input to a natui ' allanguage interface is normally in a form of dialog and users tend to input short  , elliptic , ambiguous aud even ungrammatical sentences to the interface  . Our experience shows that an increase in the size and complexity of the system ~ n order to integrate full syntaciic processing  , enhancing the DMA's capacity to handle syntactically complex sentences  , has so far outweighed the need for such capacity 19  . 
Eo 1V~fip~e ~ e ~ anti ~: etworks and portability \] ) M-COMt ,  . ~ AND utilizes two types of semantic networks . One is the semantic network that is developed under the MT system as domain knowledge that DM -COMMAND utilizes  . The other as the network of memoxy which is unique to DM-COMMAND  . 
This memory represents a hierarchy of concepts involved in commanding and question-answering necessary for the development of machine translation systems  . This memory network is written with generic concepts for development of MT systems  , so that this memory we have developed at CMT should be portable to other systems  2?  . 
The control mechanism ( i . e . , spreading activation guided marker-passing algorithm  ) and the actual functions for performing actions are separate  ( actu ' , d function sale integrated iuto the \] D ~/ ~ -COMMAND memory network  )  . This separation makes the system highly portable , first because virtually no change is necessary in the control mecharfism forirans polting to other systems  , and second because the size of the whole system can be trimmed or expanded according to them a - chine's  aw61able virtual memory space simply by changing the size of the DM-COMMAND memory network  21  . 
Thus , ~m der DMA , a natural anguage interface can 1) directly spr , ~admarkers on the target system's already existing semautic network  22  , utilizing the existing knowledge 19 Although , we have seen that it is effective in parsing noisy continuous sl  ) eech input ( Tomabechi & Tomita\[ms\] )  .

V . Conclusion
DM- . COMMAND is the first practical application of the DMA paradigm of natural anguage understanding  , in which parsing and memory-based inference is integrated  . This system has been proven to be highly effective in knowledge-based MT development  . It is due to the complexity of system implementations in a largescale MT project that grammar and knowledge base writers axe not expected to have expertise outheinternals of the translation system  , whereas it is necessary for such a group of project members to access the system internal functions  . DM-COMMAND makes this access possible through a natural language command and question answering interface  . Since DM-COMMAND uses the spreading activation guided marker-passing algorithm  , in a memory access parser which directly accesses the MT system's already exist ~ ing network of concepts  , inference is integrated into memory activity . Since there is a separate memory network for concepts representing commanding and question -answering that are generic to MT system development  , the system is highly portable . The DM-COMMAND system demonstrates the power of a direct memory access paradigm as a model for a natural language interface  , since understanding in this model is al ' e cognition of the input sentence with the existing knowledge in memory  , and as soon as such understanding is done , the desired command can be directly triggered ( or the question directly answered )  . 
With DMA's ability to handlextra-sential phenomena  ( including ellipsis , anaphora , pronoun reference , and word sense ambiguity ) , which are typical in a practical natural language commaud/query inputs  , DMA is one ideal paradigm for natural anguage interfaces as shown in our DM-COMMAND system  . Also , DMA's integration of parsing and inference into an unified semantic memory search has proven to be highly effective in this application  .
