Abstract
Most of the known stochastic sentence generators use syntactically annotated corpora , performing the projection to the surface in one stage . However , in fullfledged text generation , sentence realization usually starts from semantic ( predicate-argument ) structures . To be able to deal with semantic structures , stochastic generators require semantically annotated , or , even better , multilevel annotated corpora . Only then can they deal with such crucial generation issues as sentence planning , linearization and morphologization . Multilevel annotated corpora are increasingly available for multiple languages . We take advantage of them and propose a multilingual deep stochastic sentence realizer that mirrors the state-of-the-art research in semantic parsing . The realizer uses an SVM learning algorithm.
For each pair of adjacent levels of annotation , a separate decoder is defined . So far , we evaluated the realizer for Chinese,
English , German , and Spanish.
1 Introduction
Recent years saw a significant increase of interest in corpus-based natural language generation ( NLG ), and , in particular , in corpus-based ( or stochastic ) sentence realization , i.e ., that part of NLG which deals with mapping of a formal ( more or less abstract ) sentence plan onto a chain of inflected words ; cf ., among others , ( Langkilde and Knight , 1998; Oh and Rudnicky , 2000; Bangalore and Rambow , 2000; Wan et al , 2009). The advantage of stochastic sentence realization over traditional rule-based realization is mainly threefold : ( i ) it is more robust , ( ii ) it usually has a significantly larger coverage ; ( iii ) it is per se language-and domain-independent . Its disadvantage is that it requires at least syntactically annotated corpora of significant size ( Bangalore et al , 2001). Given the aspiration of NLG to start from numeric time series or conceptual or semantic structures , syntactic annotation even does not suffice : the corpora must also be at least semantically annotated.
Up to date , deep stochastic sentence realization was hampered by the lack of multiple-level annotated corpora . As a consequence , available stochastic sentence generators either take syntactic structures as input ( and avoid thus the need for multiple-level annotation ) ( Bangalore and Rambow , 2000; Langkilde-Geary , 2002; Filippova and Strube , 2008), or draw upon hybrid models that imply a symbolic submodule which derives the syntactic representation that is then used by the stochastic submodule ( Knight and Hatzivassiloglou , 1995; Langkilde and Knight , 1998).
The increasing availability of multilevel annotated corpora , such as the corpora of the shared task of the Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning ( CoNLL ), opens new perspectives with respect to deep stochastic sentence generation?although the fact that these corpora have not been annotated with the needs of generation in mind , may require additional adjustments , as has been , in fact , in the case of our work.
98
In this paper , we present a Support Vector Machine ( SVM)-based multilingual dependency-oriented stochastic deep sentence realizer that uses multilingual corpora of the CoNLL ?09 shared task ( Hajic ?, 2009) for training . The sentences of these corpora are annotated with shallow semantic structures , dependency trees , and lemmata ; for some of the languages involved , they also contain morphological feature annotations . The multilevel annotation allows us to take into account all levels of representation needed for linguistic generation and to model the projection between pairs of adjacent levels by separate decoders , which , in its turn , facilitates the coverage of such critical generation tasks as sentence planning , linearization , and morphologization . The presented realizer is , in principle , language-independent in that it is trainable on any multilevel annotated corpus . In this paper , we discuss its performance for Chinese , English , German , and Spanish.
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows . In Section 2, we discuss how the shallow semantic annotation in the CoNLL ?09 shared task corpora should be completed in order to be suitable for generation . Section 3 presents the training setup of our realizer . Section 4 shows the individual stages of sentence realization : from the semantic structure to the syntactic structure , from the syntactic structure to the linearized structure and from the linearized structure to a chain of inflected word forms ( if applicable for the language in question ). Section 5 outlines the experimental set up for the evaluation of our realizer and discusses the results of this evaluation . In Section 6, finally , some conclusions with respect to the characteristics of our realizer and its place in the research landscape are drawn.
The amount of the material which comes into play makes it impossible to describe all stages in adequate detail . However , we hope that the overview provided in what follows still suffices to fully assess our proposal.
2 Completing the Semantic Annotation
The semantic annotation of sentences in CoNLL ?09 shared task corpora follows the PropBank annotation guidelines ( Palmer et al , 2005). Problematic from the viewpoint of generation is that this annotation is not always a connected acyclic graph . As a consequence , in these cases no valid ( connected ) syntactic tree can be derived . The most frequent cases of violation of the connectivity principle are not attached adjectival modifiers , determiners , adverbs , and coordinations ; sometimes , the verb is not connected with its argu-ment(s ). Therefore , prior to starting the training procedure , the semantic annotation must be completed : non-connected adjectival modifiers must be annotated as predicates with their syntactic heads as arguments , determiners must be ? translated ? into quantifiers , detached verbal arguments must be connected with their head , etc.
Algorithm 1 displays the algorithm that completes the semantic annotations of the corpora.
Each sentence xi of the corpus I , with i = 1, . . . , | I |, is annotated with its dependency tree yi and its shallow semantic graph si . The algorithm traverses yi breath-first , and examines for each node n in yi whether n?s corresponding node in si is connected with the node corresponding to the parent of n . If not , the algorithm connects both by a directed labeled edge . The direction and the label of the edge are selected consulting a look up table in which default labels and the orientation of the edges between different node categories are specified.
Figure 1 shows the semantic representation of a sample English sentence obtained after the application of Algorithm 1. The solid edges are the edges available in the original annotation ; the dashed edges have been introduced by the algorithm . The edge labels ? A0? and ? A1? stand for ? first argument ? and ? second argument ? ( of the corresponding head ), respectively , ? RA0? for ? A0 realized as a relative clause ?, and ? AM-MNR ? for ? manner modifier ?. As can be seen , 6 out of the total of 14 edges in the complete representation of this example have been added by Algorithm 1.
We still did not finish the formal evaluation of the principal changes necessary to adapt the PropBank annotation for generation , nor the quality of our completion algorithm . However , the need of an annotation with generation in mind is obvious.

Es ? ( pys , nys , ls)else // direction of the edge ??? // add the semantic edge
Es ? Es ? ( nys , pys , ls ) 3 Realizer Training Setup Figure 2 shows the training setup of our realizer.
For each level of annotation , an SVM feature extractor and for each pair of adjacent levels of annotation , an SVM decoder is defined . The Sem-Synt decoder constructs from a semantic graph the corresponding dependency tree . The Synt-Linearization decoder derives from a dependency tree a chain of lemmata , i.e ., determines the word order within the sentence . The Linearization-Morph decoder generates the inflected word form for each lemma in the chain . Both the feature extractors and the decoders are language-independent , which makes the realizer applicable to any language for which multilevel-annotated corpora are available.
To compute the score of the alternative realizations by each decoder , we apply MIRA ( Margin Infused Relaxed Algorithm ) to the features provided by the feature extractors . MIRA is one of the most successful large-margin training techniques for structured data ( Crammer et al , 2006).
It has been used , e.g ., for dependency parsing , semantic role labelling , chunking and tagging.
Since we have similar feature sets ( of comparable size ) as those for which MIRA has proven to work well , we assume that it will also perform a an

Unfortunately , due to the lack of space , we cannot present here the instantiation of MIRA for all stages of our model.
For illustration , Algorithm 2 outlines it for morphological realization.
The morphologic realization uses the minimal string edit distance ( Levenshtein , 1966) to map lemmata to word forms . As input to the MIRA-classifier , we use the lemmata of a sentence , its dependency tree and the already ordered sentence.
The characters of the input strings are reversed since most of the changes occur at the end of the words and the string edit scripts work relatively to the beginning of the string . For example , to calculate the minimal string edit distance between the lemma go and the form goes , both are first reversed by the function compute-edit-dist and then the minimal string edit script between og and seog is computed . The resulting script is Ie0Is0.
It translates into the operations ? insert e at the position 0 of the input string ? and ? insert s at the position 0?.
Before MIRA starts , we compute all minimal edit distance scripts to be used as classes of MIRA . Only scripts that occur more often than twice are used . The number of the resulting edit scripts is language-dependent ; e.g ., we get about

Figure 2: Realizer training scenario setup 1500 scripts for English and 2500 for German.
The training algorithms typically perform 6 iterations ( epochs ) over the training examples . For each training example , a minimal edit script is selected . If this script is different from the gold script , the features of the gold script are calculated and the weight vector of the SVM is adjusted according to the difference between the predicted vector and the gold feature vector . The classification task consists then in finding the classification script that maps the lemma to the correct word form . For this purpose , the classifier scores each of the minimal edit scripts according to the input , choosing the one with the highest score.
4 Sentence Generation
Sentence generation that starts from a given semantic structure as input consists in the application of the previously trained SVM decoders in sequence in order to realize the following sequence of mappings:
SemStr ? SyntStr ? LinearStr ? Surface 4.1 Semantic Generation Algorithm 3 shows the algorithm for semantic generation , i.e ., the derivation of a dependency tree from a semantic structure . It is a beam search that creates a maximum spanning tree . In the first step , a seed tree consisting of one edge is built.
In each of the subsequent steps , this tree is extended by one node . For the decision , which node
Algorithm 2: Morphological realization training with MIRA // yi , li ; yi is a dependency tree , li lemmatized sentence script-list ? {} // initialize the script-list for i ? 1 to | I | // iteration over the training examples for l ? 1 to | li | do //// iteration over the lemmata of li lemmal ? lowercase ( li,l ) // ensure that all lemmata start with a lower case letter script ? compute-edit-dist-script(lemmal , form(li,l )) if script 6? script-list script-list ? script-list ? { script } for k ? 1 to E // E = number of traininig epochs for i ? 1 to | I | // iteration over the training examples for l ? 1 to | li | do scriptp ? predict-script(li,yi,l ) scriptg ? edit-dist-script(lemmal , form(li,l )) if scriptp 6= scriptg then // update the weight vector v and the vector w , which // averages over all collected weight vectors acc.

This procedure works well since nodes that are close in the semantic structure are usually close in the syntactic tree as well . Therefore subtrees that contain those nodes are considered first.
Unlike the traditional ngram based stochastic realizers such as ( Langkilde and Knight , 1998), we use for the score calculation structured features composed of the following elements : ( i ) the lemmata , ( ii ) the distance between the starting node s and the target node t , ( iii ) the direction of the path ( if the path has a direction ), ( iv ) the sorted bag of ingoing edges labels without repi-tition , ( v ) the path of edge labels between source and target node.
The composed structured features are : ? label+dist(s , t)+dir ? label+dist(s , t)+lemmas+dir ? label+dist(s , t)+lemmat+dir ? label+dist(s , t)+lemmas+lemmat+dir ? label+dist(s , t)+bags+dir ? label+dist(s , t)+bagt+dir ? label+path(s , t)+dir 1 labelw1+labelw2 13 PoS1+PoS2+PoS32 labelw1+lemma1 14 PoS1+PoS2+PoS3+dist3 labelw1+lemma2 15 lemma1+lemma2+lemma34 labelw2+lemma1 16 lemma1+lemma2+lemma3+dist5 labelw2+lemma2 17 lemma1+lemma3+head(w1,w2,w3)6 PoS1+PoS2 18 lemma1+lemma3+head(w1,w2,w3)+dist7 PoS1+PoS2+head(w1,w2) 19 label1+label2+label3+head(w1,w2,w3)8 labelw1+labelw2+PoS1+head(w1,w2) 20 label1+label2+label3+head(w1,w2,w3)+dist9 labelw1+labelw2+PoS2+head(w1,w2) 21 label1+label2+label3+lemma1+PoS2+head(w1,w2,w3)10 labelw1+labelw2+PoS1+PoS2+head(w1,w2) 22 label1+label2+label3+lemma1+PoS2+head(w1,w2,w3)+dist11 labelw1+labelw2+PoS1+#children2+head(w1,w2) 23 label1+label2+label3+lemma2+PoS1+head(w1,w2,w3)12 labelw1+labelw2+PoS2+#children1+head(w1,w2) 24 label1+label2+label3+lemma2+PoS1+head(w1,w2,w3)+dist # global features for constituents 25 if | constituent | > 1 then label1st+labellast+labellast?1+PoSfirst+PoSlast+PoShead 26 if | constituent | > 2 then label1st+label2d+label3d+PoSlast+PoSlast?1+PoShead+contains -? 27 if | constituent | > 2 then label1st+label2d+label3d+PoSlast+PoSlast?1+lemmahead+contains -? 28 if | constituent | > 3 then PoS1st+PoS2d+PoS3d+PoS4th+PoSlast+labelhead+contains-?+pos-head 29 if | constituent | > 3 then PoSlast+PoSlast?1+PoSlast?2+PoSlast?3+PoSfirst+labelhead+contains-?+pos-head30 PoSfirst+PoSlast+lemmafirst+lemmalast+lemmahead+contains-?+pos-head Table 1: Feature schemas used for linearization ( labelw is the label of the ingoing edge to a word w in the dependency tree ; lemmaw is the lemma of w , and PoSw is the part-of-speech tag of w ; head(w1,w2, . . . ) is a function which is 1 if w1 is the head , 2 if w2 is the head , etc . and else 0; dist is the position within the constituent ; contains -? is a boolean value which is true if the sentence contains a question mark and false otherwise ; pos-head is the position of the head in the constituent ) 4.2 Dependency Tree Linearization Since we use unordered dependency trees as syntactic structures , our realizer has to find the optimal linear order for the lexemes of each dependency tree . Algorithm 4 shows our linearization algorithm . To order the dependency tree , we use a one classifier-approach for all languages?in contrast to , e.g ., Filippova and Strube (2009), who use a two-classifier approach for German.1 The algorithm is again a beam search . It starts with an elementary list for each node of the dependency tree . Each elementary list is first extended by the children of the node in the list ; then , the lists are extended stepwise by the children of the newly added nodes . If the number of lists during this procedure exceeds the threshold of 1000, the lists are sorted in accordance with their score , and the first 1000 are kept . The remaining lists are removed . Afterwards , the score of each list is adjusted according to a global score function which takes into account complex features such as the first word of a consitutent , last word , the head , and the edge label to the head ( cf . Table 1 for the list of the features ). Finally , the nodes of the depen-1We decided to test at this stage of our work a uniform technology for all languages , even if the idiosyncrasies of some languages may be handled better by specific solutions.
dency tree are ordered with respect to the highest ranked lists.
Only in a very rare case , the threshold of the beam search is exceeded . Even with a rich feature set , the procedure is very fast . The linearization takes about 3 milliseconds in average per dependency tree on a computer with a 2.8 Ghz CPU.
4.3 Morphological Realization
The morphological realization algorithm selects the edit script in accordance with the highest score for each lemma of a sentence obtained during training ( see Algorithm 2 above ) and applies then the scripts to obtain the word forms ; cf . Algorithm 5.
Table 2 lists the feature schemas used for morphological realization.
5 Experiments
To evaluate the performance of our realizer , we carried out experiments on deep generation of Chinese , English , German and Spanish , starting from CoNLL ?09 shared task corpora . The size of the test sets is listed in Table 3.2 2As in ( Langkilde-Geary , 2002) and ( Ringger et al , 2004), we used Section 23 of the WSJ corpus as test set for
English.

5.1 Evaluation Metrics
In order to measure the correctness of the semantics to syntax mapping , we use the unlabeled and labeled attachment score as it commonly used in dependency parsing . The labeled attachment score ( LAS ) is the proportion of tokens that are assigned both the correct head and the correct edge label . The unlabeled attachment score ( ULA ) is the proportion of correct tokens that are assigned the correct head.
To assess the quality of linearization , we use three different evaluation metrics . The first metric is the per-phrase/per-clause accuracy ( acc snt .), which facilitates the automatic evaluation of results : acc = correct constituentsall constituents As second evaluation metric , we use a metric related to the edit distance : di = 1? mtotal number of words ( with m as the minimum number of deletions combined with insertions to obtain the correct order ( Ringger et al , 2004)).
Algorithm 4: Dependency tree linearization // yi a dependency tree for i ? 1 to | I | // iteration over the training examples // iterate over all nodes of the dependency tree yi for n ? 1 to | yi | do subtreen ? children(n ) ? { n } ordered-listsn ? {} // initialize for all m ? subtreen do beam ? {} for all l ? ordered-lists do beam ? beam ? { append(clone(l),m )} for all l ? ordered-lists do score(l )? compute-score-for-word-list(l ) sort-lists-descending-to-score(beam,score ) if | beam | > beamsize then beam ? sublist(0,1000,beam ) ordered-listsn ? beam scoreg(l )? score(l ) + compute-global-score(l ) sort-lists-descending-in-score(beam,scoreg)
Algorithm 5: Morphological realization // yi a dependency tree , and li an ordered list of lemmata for l ? 1 to | li | do scriptp ? predict-script(li,yi,l ) forml ? apply-edit-dist-script(lemmal , scriptp ) To be able to compare our results with ( He et al ., 2009) and ( Ringger et al , 2004), we use the
BLEU score as a third metric.
For the asessment of the quality of the word form generation , we use the accuracy score . The accuracy is the ratio between correctly generated word forms and the entire set of generated word forms.
For the evaluation of the sentence realizer as a whole , we use the BLEU metric.
5.2 Experimental Results
Table 4 displays the results obtained for the isolated stages of sentence realization and of the realization as a whole , with reference to a baseline and to some state-of-the-art works . The baseline is the deep sentence realization over all stages starting from the original semantic annotation in the
CoNLL ?09 shared task corpora.
Note , that our results are not fully comparable with ( He et al , 2009; Filippova and Strube , 2009) and ( Ringger et al , 2004), respectively , since the data are different . Furthermore , Filippova and Strube (2009) linearize only English sentences 1 es+lemma 2 es+lemma+m.feats 3 es+lemma+m.feats+POS 4 es+lemma+m.feats+POS+position 5 es+lemma+(lemma+1)+m.feats 6 es+lemma+(lemma+1)+POS 7 es+lemma+(m.feats-1)+(POS-1) 8 es+lemma+(m.feats-1)+(POS-1)+position 9 es+m.feats+(m.feats-1) 10 es+m.feats+(m.feats+1) 11 es+lemma+(m.feats-1) 12 es+m.feats+(m.feats-1)+(m.feats-2) 13 es+m.feats+POS 14 es+m.feats+(m.feats+1) 15 es+m.feats+(m.feats+1)+lemma 16 es+m.feats 17 es+e0+e1+m.feats 18 es+e0+e1+e2+m.feats 19 es+e0+e1+e2+e3+m.feats 20 es+e0+e1+e2+e3+e4+m.feats 21 es+e0+m.feats Table 2: Feature schemas used for morphological realization

For Spanish , to the best of our knowledge , no linearization experiments have been carried out so far . Therefore , we cannot contrast our results with any reference work.
As far as morphologization is concerned , the performance achieved by our realizer for English is somewhat lower than in ( Minnen et al , 2001) (97.8% vs . 99.8% of accuracy ). Note , however , that Minnen et al describe a combined analyzer-generator , in which the generator is directly derived from the analyzer , which makes both approaches not directly comparable.
5.3 Discussion
The overall performance of our SVM-based deep sentence generator ranges between 0.611 ( for German ) and 0.688 ( for Chinese ) of the BLEU score.
HALogen?s ( Langkilde-Geary , 2002) scores range between 0.514 and 0.924, depending on the completeness of the input . The figures are not directly comparable since HALogen takes as input syntactic structures . However , it gives us an idea where our generator is situated.
Traditional linearization approaches are rule-based ; cf ., e.g ., ( Bro?ker , 1998; Gerdes and Kahane , 2001; Duchier and Debusmann , 2001), and ( Bohnet , 2004). More recently , statistic language models have been used to derive word order , cf.
(Ringger et al , 2004; Wan et al , 2009) and ( Filippova and Strube , 2009). Because of its partially free order , which is more difficult to handle than fixed word order , German has often been worked with in the context of linearization . Filippova and Strube (2009) adapted their linearization model originally developed for German to English . They use two classifiers to determine the word order in a sentence . The first classifier uses a trigram LM to order words within constituents , and the second ( which is a maximum entropy classifier ) determines the order of constituents that depend on a finite verb . For English , we achieve with our SVM-based classifier a better performance.
As mentioned above , for German , Filippova and Strube (2009)?s two classifier approach pays off because it allows them to handle nonprojective structures for the Vorfeld within the field model.
It is certainly appropriate to optimize the performance of the realizer for the languages covered in a specific application . However , our goal has been so far different : to offer an off-the-shelf language-independent solution.
The linearization error analysis , first of all of German and Spanish , reveals that the annotation of coordinations in corpora of these languages as ? X ? and/or /. . .? Y ? is a source of errors . The ? linear ? annotation used in the PropBank (? X ? and/or /. . .? Y ?) appears to facilitate higher quality linearization . A preprocessing stage for automatic conversion of the annotation of coordinations in the corpora would have certainly contributed to a higher quality . We refrained from doing this because we did not want to distort the figures.
The morphologization error analysis indicates a number of error sources that we will address in the process of the improvement of the model.
Among those sources are : quotes at the beginning of a sentence , acronyms , specific cases of starting capital letters of proper nouns ( for English and
Spanish ), etc.

As far as the contrastive evaluation of the quality of our morphologization stage is concerned , it is hampered by the fact that for the traditional manually crafted morphological generators , it is difficult to find thorough quantitative evaluations , and stochastic morphological generators are rare.
As already repeatedly pointed out above , so far we intentionally refrained from optimizing the individual realization stages for specific languages.
Therefore , there is still quite a lot of room for improvement of our realizer when one concentrates on a selected set of languages.
6 Conclusions
We presented an SVM-based stochastic deep multilingual sentence generator that is inspired by the state-of-the-art research in semantic parsing . It uses similar techniques and relies on the same resources . This shows that there is a potential for stochastic sentence realization to catch up with the level of progress recently achieved in parsing technologies.
The generator exploits recently available multilevel-annotated corpora for training . While the availability of such corpora is a condition for deep sentence realization that starts , as is usually the case , from semantic ( predicate-argument ) structures , we discovered that current annotation schemata do not always favor generation such that additional preprocessing is necessary . This is not surprising since stochastic generation is a very young field . An initiative of the generation community would be appropriate to influence future multilevel annotation campaigns or to feed back the enriched annotations to the ? official ? resources.3 The most prominent features of our generator are that it is per se multilingual , it achieves an extremely broad coverage , and it starts from abstract semantic structures . The last feature allows us to cover a number of critical generation issues : sentence planning , linearization and morphological generation . The separation of the semantic , syntactic , linearization and morphological levels of annotation and their modular processing by separate SVM decoders also facilitates a subsequent integration of other generation tasks such as referring expression generation , ellipsis generation , and aggregation . As a matter of fact , this generator instantiates the Reference Architecture for Generation Systems ( Mellish et al , 2006) for linguistic generation.
A more practical advantage of the presented deep stochastic sentence generator ( as , in principle , of all stochastic generators ) is that , if trained on a representative corpus , it is domain-independent . As rightly pointed out by Belz (2008), traditional wide coverage realizers such as KPML ( Bateman et al , 2005), FUF/SURGE ( Elhadad and Robin , 1996) and RealPro ( Lavoie and Rambow , 1997), which were also intended as off-the-shelf plugin realizers still tend to require a considerable amount of work for integration and finetuning of the grammatical and lexical resources . Deep stochastic sentence realizers have the potential to become real off-the-shelf modules.
