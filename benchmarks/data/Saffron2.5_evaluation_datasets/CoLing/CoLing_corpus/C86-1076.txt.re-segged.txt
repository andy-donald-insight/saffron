This paper presents a new computing model for constructing a two-way simultaneous interpretation system between Korean and Japanese  . We also propose several methodological approaches to the construction of a two-way simultaneous interpretation system  , and realize the two-way interpreting process as a model unifying both linguistic competence and linguistic performance  . The model is verified theoretically and through actual applications  . 
I . Introduction
Our goal is to develop a two-way simultaneous interpretation system between Korean and Japanese  . In order to achieve this goal , we have designed a specific computing model , which is a computer program based on the a\ ] gorithll that formalizes the mechanism of two-way simultaneous interpretation and the correspondence of the two languages  . Our computational approach consists of two parts ? First  , build an explicit computational model , then sh ( m the practical applica-bi Iity and theoretical validity of the model ? The most significant advantage of using a formal descrip-  . 
tion to represent our " system is in that the descriptive contents of the representative algoritb ~ do not depend upon the convent J  . or ml approaches to machine translation ? ~ . J c have also implemented a prototypint ~ system . \[~ AR ~ . . , a two-way simultaneous interpretation system between Korean and Japanese  . In this paper , we outline the features of the system without \[4oin \[~ into the details . 
2 . Methodology the adjusted grammar with the interpretation mechanism : a representation  , an a \] gor it b ~ l , and a complexity metric . We take the following items as the subjects of c ; lethodological study . 
( I ) The theory of grammar
We require an adjusted grammar to be suitable for description of the two languages as input and output  . 
It is intuitiwly clear that the more cc ~ , municatable the adjusted gralr ~ imr is , expressed by a powerful for-real system , the more efficiently is the grammar inter-prcted . We adopt generalized phrase structure grarl , ~lar(GPSG ) framework\[\]\] . 
(2 ) The notion of direct realization of interpretation Because we need to connect competence and performance as directly as possible  , one of the goals of our study is to identify rules of the grammar with the manipula-tive unit of interpretation in a one-to-one fashion ? Thus we carefully distinguish between the grammar and the rules of interpretation  . For this , we adopt the following notions as the methodological principles of our system : I  ) Equivalence of grammar\[5\]~2 ) gralf mlar cover ' and grarmlar modif:ieation\[6\]5   3  ) type transparency\[2\] , and 4) an invariant of form a \] languages\[4\] . 
(3 ) The notion of complexity measure fhe direct association between unit interpretation time cost and the complexity of a sequential operation during interpretation can be measured  . 
Our approach is intuitively motivated by Cha~mky's hypothesis\[l\]:hc ~ logeneous communication by the same linguistic performance is possible among those who have the same linguistic competence  . We take a performance theory to be the study of realtime processing of languages  . The performance theory cannot be developed without a c ~ a petence theory  . This hypothesis suggests that a key point of contact between the theory of grab  , mr and the interpretation control is the natural link between the theory of knowledge representation and the theory of knowledge proeessing  . 
That is , for two classes of languages to be interpret-able by humal n being  , there exists an interpreting procedure . Consequently , if we can show that there is an adjusted grab , far for the two languages plus an adequate interpreting procedure to predetermine the mechanism of ' our two-way simultaneous interpretation  , then we have some support for our methodology . In order to guarantee two-way simultaneous interpretation  , there are several subareas to be inquired . The first is the type of representation constructed during the interpretation  . The second is the method of utilizing the representation during the interpretation  . 
The third is the measure of c~nputational complexity during the interpretation  . These three components of a complete c ( ~ a putational model are necessary for linking 3 . Linguistic Data Structure and Computing Model in order to investigate the correspondence between the two languages  , we partition a grammar into independent components : segmented words  , the word order , morphology , syntax , and semantics . The partition of a grammar constitutes an important step of modular decomposition into the interpretation subsystems  . 
3 . 1 Interpretation strategy of segmented word component  3  . 1 . 1 Data structure In comparison with other symbol system  , every hmlan language has a remarkable characteristics  ; namely , the structure of segmented words . The utterance as a segmented word conveys a message regarding some matter  , and communicates the information concerning the matter  . Ase\[~nented word is a word or an ordered pair of words  . Using some criteria : positional transformation , substitution and insertion , we can specify a segmented word of Korean or Japanese  . 
3.1.2 Word order in a segmented word of Korean or
Japanese are observed , such as an agglutinative language structure and the identical word order  ( SOV )  . In addition , we sight three corresponding word order properties of segmented words between the two languages : For some  ( kl , k2) e:Sk and ( jl , j2) eSj , where Sk and Sj are a set of Korean segmented words ja set of Japanese segmented words  , respectively , and I a binary relation ( interpretation ) :\[ Property I \] reflexivity ( kl , k2) < I>(jl , j2) . 
e . g . 0 ~ W<I>4-~Iq~l ( our nation ) \ [ Property2\] synlnetry ( jl , j2) < I>(k2 , kl) .

e . g . Bako X < I > % t t ' ~ ~ ( a Japanese ) ~mong above properties , Property 3 depends upon Korean pragmatic information . 
3.1.3 Computing model
The production form of ase\[nented word of Korean or Japanese can be described in the rule forms in a regular granmar  , and it is right linear . Since a language L generated by some right linear grammar G is regular  , there exists a finite automaton which accepts L . If L is a contextfree language and s is a substitution map such that for every a eV  ( a fixed vocabulary )  , s(a ) is a contextfree language , then s(L ) is a contextfree language . A type of substitution map that is of special int crest is a hc~mmorphia a  . If ' L is a regular language and his a hom ~ rJorphia ~ l  , then the range of tile inverse homomorphismff ~ ( L ) is also regular language . And , for two given regular grammars G and G ' , if L(G):L(G') , there is a sequence equivalence . Two sequences generate the same word ord-er in the increasing length order  . 
3 . 2 Interpretation strategy of Norphological component  3  . 2 . 1 . Data structure The study of the structure of words occupies an important place within linguistics  , s and wiched between phonology and syntax . Horphemes may also be partitioned into lexical and grammatical classes  . Lexical morphemes are generally free , while many of the grammatical morphemes are bound . 
3.2.2 C~n puting model
In a given Korean-Japanese ( or Japanese-Korean ) dictionary , let Dk be the set of morphemes of Korean , and Dj be the set of morphemes of Japanese . A mapping I between the sets is defined as follows  . 
I(Dk ) = Dj implying that the image of Dk is Dj ; taking the inverse mapping , 
I(Dj):Dk .
By generalizing the relation and the mapping between the two sets  , we may consider the set of Korean words to be a domain  , and the set of Japanese words a range . 
~ssuming the same cardinality for both , Dk and Dj may be partitioned as shown below . Here we suppose I < I , k2, . .kneDk ,  jl , j2, . .jmeDj : ( I ) one-to-one ( ki,ji ) e DkxDj . 
(2) one-to-many(ki . lJn . Ji2, . . . Ji , ( il \]) eDkX2"i (3) many-to-nlany(Ikihki2 , -  .   . ki , ( i ) l , lJil , Ji2 . '" Ji ,   ,   , ( i )) e21) k x2 l ) j where , AxB is the Cartesian product of the two sets A and B ~ and  2 A is the a power set of a set A . 
Obviously , one-to-one correspondence is isomorphic . 
Naturally , our attention will be focused on the one-to-many and many-to-many relations  . Interpretation of these relations depends on various factors : allomorph  , synonym and homonym . Thus , as for the interpretation which is dependent on synonymy or polysemy  , we charac--terize the interpretation by specifying the canonical form  , or the semantic feature instantiation , respectively . 
3 . 3 Syntax level interpretation strategy We examine the syntactic structure of the two languages  . Frcn ~ the correspondence in a seg Ta ented word and word order  , it is seen intuitively that they are strongly equivalent  . And there is a sufficient linguistic evidence for it based on the study of experimental comparative  linguistics\[2\]  . ~ phrase structure preserves each lexical semantic feature of a constituent structure  , and a parse tree describes the construction of syntactic representation of a sentence  . Horeover ~ a partial tree in the whole parse tree plays a role of adjusting semantic and syntactic interpretation  . Let us compare the examples of two parse tree constructions  ( Fig I ) :

Fig 1: Syntactic trees of " ( I ) thought ( somebody ) went ( to somewhere ) ' It is obvious that parse trees coincide with each other in one-to-one fashion  , but syntactic categories do not . This implies that two given languages , Korean and Japanese , do not generate the same set of sential forms . Furthermore , there is no algorit~n for deciding whether or not two given contextfree grammars generate the same sentential forms  . This is the reason why we adopt the covering grar ~artechnique to parse the source language for interpretation  . 
3.4 Semantics , pra ~ aatics and ambiguity
Semantics and pragmatics also play an important role in generating the wellformed target language  . In the interpretation between Korean and Japanese  , there exist several kinds of inherently ambiguous sentences which are generated only by the ambiguous gralrmars of  4  . KJGr~nmar We design the KJ ( or JK ) grammar which elgninates syntactical and semantical ambiguity of ' both languages for interpretation ? This gra~m~mr corresponds to the ccxn municative c~npetence for the interpretation between Korean and Japanese  . The KJ ( JK ) grammar is motivated by grammar modification and the cover in l\]grammar  . 
ALGORITHM " irregularity categories removal or adjustment and semantic features insertion  . 
Input : a5-tuple phrase structure grammar G : ( N , Tk , Tj , P , S) . 
Output : an equivalent 5-tuple phrase structure grammar G': ( N ' , Tk'\[semj\] , Tj' , P' , S') . 
Method : entpirical and heuristic method ? llere N and I ~' are nontermin a \]  . s , Tk , Tj , Tk'anclTo ' are terminals , sem ~ is semantic features , P and P ' a reproduction rules , ~ ndS and S ' are the start symbols ? The JK granmmr is designed analogously  . In the framc ~ vorl , : of the generalized phrase structure grammar , the semantic features are accepted by a special phrase structure rule  , that is a linking rule , which causes the relevant information about the phrase to be passed down the tree as a feature on the syntactic nodes  . 
Therefore , interpretation procedure is constructed by a succinct algorithn founded on the K-J  ( J - K ) grammar .

5.1\[Iomonymous construction
There are some kinds of construction types provided by syntax relations of each constituent  . Among them , modificatior l is a construction type related to Head and Attributes  . Coordination imp\] . ies that more than two subconstituents have syntactical coordination re-  . 
lation . Let us consider the following Japanese utter -a noes : I  ) t ~2 ~ . I - ~ , ~\[T\]~>~<~o ( modification " ( Someone ) goes to school , and eats bread . 
2 ) ~> 99:<\[-c\]g*~-~9<o ( coordination " ( Someone ) eats\[ ) read and goes to school . ' The two utterances imply the semantic notions of modification and coordination  , respectively , but have the same conjunction morpheme \[ tel . Semantically , they are represented in Korean by the outcome of interpretation as follows : I  ) ~ d ;  , ~? lld*l~'~~z'~#4=*:I . ( modification ) 2),, ~ . ~-,-'\] . , Lq ;, '- ol\]",\]'-l .   ( coordination ) All such morpheme ambiguities induce not only lexieal semantic ambiguity but sential ambiguity  , in order to interpret such ambiguous utterances , we c~n ploy semantic feature specification as the discipline of the semantic conjunction schemata  . The foilow in ~ rules account immediately for the sentences in the example  . 
Here we use the GPSG notations : ( I ) modification schemaS->\[l\[sem ~0 , Conj * l\] , lt\[\]semc~1\] where ~ Y ~\[ (0 , 1) , ( O , O )\] (2) eoordinat:i . on schema S->\[i\[semrm , Conj . , '-\], II\[sem~l\]where ~, (:( I , 0), (1, 1)\]5 . 2 Missing construction Korean and Japanese allow one of " the constituents of a sentence not to be explicitly stated when it is understandable fr~ll the context  . In the GPSG framework , this kind of difference can be expressed by a FOOT feature S\[  , ASH\[3\] .

Seoul'6.K-J(J-k ) system
In order to define a two-way interpretation system more formally  , we formulate the internal interfaee ( K-J system ) for the interpretation . This interface corresponds to the transducer of interpretation  . We can define the K-J(J-K ) syster , ; as a 3-tuple grammar G : ( wj , k ( or j ) , wk ) , where wk and wi are Korean words and Japanese words  , respectively , and k(j):Wi-~Wk(Wk--~Wj ) is a homomorphism . The K-J ( J - K ) system G defines the following sequence preserving the word order : w~-k  ( wD , w~w ~= k(wDk(w ~) ,  .   . . . .
It also defines the language
L(G k ) = k i(w i ) l i > O .
As mentioned above , the K-J(J-K ) systel ; L constitutes a simple device for interpretation . A language defined by the K-J ( J - K ) systom corresponds to the target language . Inversely , the mapping j of w ~ into wi is such that the inverse hom ci ~ or phi~ij  ( wO = wilk ( wi ) = w ~ , j : k exists . Thus , we define the two-way simultaneous interpretation system ~ by : j  ( Lk ) : k  ~ ( Lk ) = wilk ( wj ) eLk . 
We can define our system ~ using the extended notion  ; the inverse homo ~\] or phism can be replaced by the direct operation of a finite substitution  . Consider agra\[~ar(e . g . Korean ) GK "= ( Nk , Tk , Pk , Sk ) and let j be a finite substitution , defined on the vocabulary ( NkuTk )* , such that j ( w ) is a finite ( possibly empty ) set of word for each word A . We denote j(Nk ) =\[ ~ j , j(Tk ) = Tj , PjDj(Pk ) , Sjnj(Sk ) . Then , the gray , nat ( e . g . Japanese)
Gj = ( Nj , Tj , Pj , Sj ) is an interpretation of Gk . If I(Gk ) , I ( C j ) are the sets of all interpretation of Gk and Gj , respectively , then I(G#') = I(Gj ) , and I is an invariant for Gk and

7. Complexity of System NARA
The complexity of the algorithm is usually measured by the growth rate of its time and space requirements  , as a function of the size of its input ( or the length of input string ) to which the algorithm is applied . We adopt a finite state transducer as a computing model which governs the fundamental interpretation control  . 
Since we do not count the time it takes to read the input  , finite state languages have zero complexity . If reading the input is counted , then finite languages have time complexity of exactly A  ( the length of input string )  . Such languages are interpretable in exactly time it  , and then called realtime languages . The interpretation which is accompanied by cooccurrence dependency cannot be done in general without relying on arbitrary lookahead or rescanning of the output  . 
However , the nature of online interpretation is un -changeable  . Consequently , our system \] ~ R_&is interpreted in realtime . 
8. Concluding Remarks
Our approach for constructing this system has both logical view and experimental view  ; the former is given by mathematical formalization  , the latter by the correspondence of two languages  . In the view of computational linguistics , we separated the mechanism of our two-way simultaneous interpretation system into the levels of abstract theory  , algorit ~ ii , and implementation to carve out the results at each levelir a more independent f'a shion  . In order to do so , we specified four important levels of description  ; the lowest level is morphology , the second level is se~lented word , the third level is syntax and semantics , and the top level controls the computing model of each level  . 
Hence , we could determine the range of correspondence between internal representations of both grammars  , and the basic architecture of the machinery actually instantiates the algorithn  . Consequently , our model produces the extra power by the proposed theory with multiple levels of representation and systematic mapping between the corresponding levels of two languages  , because interpretation efficiency requires both functional and mathematical discussions  . Nevertheless , the complete pragmatic interpretation still remains quite obscure  . Finally , we confront the proble ~ , ~ whether it is possible to construct a two-way simuitaneous interpretation system between other two different language systems such as Japanese and English  . We presuppose that the key point of problem -solving is in the study of universality and individuality between two given languages  .
