Abstract : A calculus is presented which allows an efficient treatment of the follow-ing components : Tenses  , temporal conjunctions , temporal adverbials ( of " definite " type) , temporal quantifications and phases . 
The phases are a means for structuring the set of time-points t where a certain propo-sition is valid  . For one proposition there may exist several " phase "- perspectives  . The calculus has integrative properties , i . e . 
all five components are represented by the same formal means  . This renders possible a rather easy combination of all informations and conditions coming from the afore said components  . 
I . Prerequisits
We assume that propositions are replaced by phase-sets : A proposition R is something which is true or false at each point t of the time axis U : 
Value(R , t ) = T ( rue ) or F ( alse).
A phase is an interval ( span or moment ) p on the time axis , which a truth value ( denoted by q ( p ) ) is ass igned to : q ( p ) = T : p is an affirmative ( main- ) phase . 
q(p ) = F : p is a declining ( secondary ) phase . 
A phase-set P is a pair \[ P ~ , q\]:P ~ is a set of intervals p and q is an evaluation function assigning a truth value to each  p6 P  ~ . 
The substitution of propositions R by phase -sets P is not unequivocal  , but also not arbitrary . Some necessary conditions for the relationship between R and its " surrogate " P have been introduced and discussed elsewhere  ( Kunze 1986 )  . One essential point is that the simple " moment logic " becomes an " interval logic "  . 
This is also connected with questions as expressed by the different definitions of HOLD  , OCCUR and OCCURING in Allen 1984 . 
Another fact connected with phases is the unsymmetry in the case of a negation :  ( I ) The museum is open today . 
+ The museum is open all day today.
(2) The museum is closed to day.
= The museum is closed all day today.
The proposition R is supposed to be fixed and given  . P is considered as variable and provides a formal counterpart of different phase-perspect ives for a certain proposition  . The German sentence (3) Thomasraucht . 
has at least two of them ( and consequently two meanings ) : " Thomasis as moker " and " Thomas is smoking " . Furthermore the use of phases enables us to consider some parts of T  ( R ) as unimportant , accidental or exceptional . These parts form declining phases of R . The affirmative phases of R need not be disjunct  , and they need not be contained in T(R ) . It is also possible to introduce nested phases , so that rather complicated courses may be rcpresented  . 
2 . Some formal definitions ? = p ~ Let PI\[i' qi \]  ( i:1 , 2) be two phase-sets with P~:P ~ . Then PI and P2 may be connected by means of sentential logic : For any functor " o "  ( e . g .  " . . . and . . . " and " if , then .  ")  .   .   .   .   .   .   . one defines P~o P2D~f\[P ~ , qloq 21 with P ~: p ~ : p ~ . 
Phase-operators connect arbitrary phase-sets . As an example we take the phase-operator OCC:\[ P ~ q\]=P : OCC  ( PI , P2) means P~=PI and IT , if q1 ( p ) = T and there is a p26P2q ( p ) =  with q2 ( P2 ) = T and p~P2%@'F otherwise . 
""" ~ P2"If one replaces pnp2#~byp = , one gets the definition of P = PER(PI , P2) . 
P = OCC(PI , P2 ) means " P2 happens during PI"'P=PER ( PI'P2 )  "  P2 happens throughout PI " The important point is that these relation-ships between PI and  P2 are not represented by a Yes-No-decision , but again by a phase-set P : OCC(PI , P2 ) selects from the T-phases of the first argument those p for which the characteristic cond it ion  ( = there is a P2 The phase-operator OCC is not the same thing as OCCUR or OCCURING in Allen  1984  . 
There are at least three differences : OCCUR is a Yes-No-predicate  , has as first argument an event and as second an intervall and the arguments are no sets as in our case  . It makes at any rate difficulties to generalize such a Yes-No-property for sets as arguments  . 
This is one reason for our definitions . More important is that e . g . OCC(PI , P2 ) may be used as argument in another phase -operator  . 
This enables us to express quite easily the essential time relation in " In July there are evening-planes on Tuesday and Friday  .  "  . 
One needs some other operations :
Given P =\[ P ~ , q \] , then alt ( P ) contains exactly those phases which one gets by join-ing all phases of P which are not seperated from each other and have the same q- value  ( inductively understood )   . 
If one designates by U ? the phase-set consist ing only of U as interval  ( with q ( U ) : T )   , then alt ( P ) = UO means that the union of all T-phases of P covers the time axis U  , i . e . "P is always true " . 
Insect ? I . we already sketched how to represent proposi tions R by phase-sets P  . 
We write P = < R > . Now we have to explain the same for temporal adverbials : < tuesday > is a phase--set P  , whose intervals p are the days , and exactly the Tuesdays have the q-value T . In < day > all intervals ( : day ) have the q-value T .   <1982> is a phase-set with years as intervals , but only one (:"1982") has the q-value T . Obviously x < tuesday > is a single unspec if ied Tuesday  , x < day > an unspecified day . 
3. Examples
Now we are ready to give some examples.
Let be R = " John goes to see Mary " . < R >: P is obviously the set of all visi ts of John to Mary  . Then we have: ( 4 ) In 1982 John want to see Mary every

is represented by the following condition ( , ,~" for " if . . . , then . . . ") : (5) alt (<1982 > ~ PER(<year >, . . . 
alt(<tuesday>-~OCC(<day >, P )))) : U ?
This has to be read as : It is true . ( a \] t ( .   .   . ) = U ?) , that 1982 is a year , durinq which (<1982 > ~ PER ( . cyear >, . . . ) it was / i s / w i l l be a lways the case ( alt (  .   .   . )) that every Tuesday is a day , when it occurred/occurs/will occur ( < tuesday > ~ OCC ( < day > ,   . . . )) that R happens . It should be noted that ( 5 ) has no reference to tenses \[ Whereas ( 4 ) represents something with the logical status of being true or false  ,   ( 6 ) defines a certain phase-set : ( 6 ) The Tuesdays when John want to see Mary
The corresponding expression is ( 7 ) OCC ( <tuesday > , P ) . 
This time the additional , condition is not a \] t ( .   .   . ) = UO as before , butalt(o .   . ) + ~ U ? ("~" assign for negation , ~ U ? the phase-set containing only U as in terval with g  ( U )  : ~' )  :  ( 8 ) alt ( OCC ( <tuesday:> , P ) : ~ U ?
This means : (9) There is at \] . east one Tuesday when R happened . 
In this case it is possible to apply the x- operation  ( to ( 7 ) ):  ( 10 ) xOCC ( <tuesday > , \ ]?)
This can be paraphrased as ( II ) A Tuesday when John went to see Mary Behind these examples stand some genera \] questions : \]' he two conditional t  (   .   .   . ) = U ? and alt ( .   .   .   ) #~ U ? have the status of truth-cond it ions  . They refer to the two cases , where a phase-set is considered as a Yes-No -property and where it is the basis for a determined  ( or defined ) time , which is again a phase-set . This becomes clear by ( I 2 ) As long as John went to see Mary every Tuesday ( she believed in his promise of marriage )   . 
These spans ( there may be more ! ) have to be represented by ( 13 ) alt ( < tuesday > ~ OCC ( <day> , P )) with truth-conditional t ( .   .   . )% ~ U ? ( for 112) becomes inacceptable , if there is no such Tuesday at all !) . IsR = " Mary believes in John's promise of marriage " and < R >= P  , so
OCC(<day> , P )) , P ) ) = U ? is the corresponding expression for ( 12 )  . If we take (13) as ~ , (5) becomes (15) alt (<1982> ~ PER(<year > , ~)) = U ? and (14) becomes (16) alt ( PER(~ , P )) = U ? . 
Using the definition of PER one gets ( 17 ) alt ( < ~982> ~ PER ( <year> , P )) = U ? , which can be paraphrased as ( 18 ) During 1982 Mary believed in John's promise of marriage . 
This answers a second general question : Time logical inferences may be based on these expressions which represent phase-sets  . 
Another question concerns quantification.
The expressions avoid the ( always trouble some ) quantification and render it possible to per form the inferences rather simply  . 
The quantifications are " hidden " in the fol lowing sense : The expression  ( 19 ) Vx3 yalt ( OCC ( XP l , YP2 ) ) # ~ U ? ( for every T-phase Pl of Pl there is a T-phase P2 of P2 such that P2 happens during pl ) is equivalent to ( 20 ) alt ( PI~OCC ( PI , P2 ) ) = U ? ( an expression without formal quantifica-tion ! )  . It can be proved , that for every expression with ( linguistically reasonable ) quantification there is an equivalent expression without explicit quantificat ion  . 
The expressions reflect in fact a structure of texts  . The constituents of this structure belong to two categories : " propositional " and " temporal "  , where the second includes some quantificat ions  ( ever ~ Tuesday , ~ on Tuesdays ) , frequencies ( three times ) , measures ( for three days ) ,   ( 21 ) gives a simplified version of this structure for  ( 12 ) :
John want to see Maryp.
every Tuesday t.p she believed ... p.
So we have three types of structures ( if we restrict ourselves to the sentence- level  )  :  ( a ) the syntactic structure ( e . g . a dependency tree ) , some features of a constituent tree , but reminds more of categorial grammar , if one considers the problem thoroughly ,   ( c ) the structure of the expression ( 14 ) for ( 12 )   . 
They may be used as interface structures for two steps of analysis  . The step from ( b ) to ( c ) has to apply rules , which we already used for ( 5 ) :  ( 22 ) Pevery Tuesday alt ( <tuesday > - , OCC(<day > , P )) (23) as long as P , P ~ alt(PER(P , P )) etc . It should be noted , that the three essential temporal parts in ( 21 ) are expressed by totally different means :
Tuesday : phase-set every : . . . ~ PO ( . .  .  ,  .   .   . )  ( PO = variable phase-operator ) as long as : phase-operator
Another example is ( 24 ) Ponlyon Tuesdays ~ alt ( OCC ( <day> , P ) ~ tuesday >
