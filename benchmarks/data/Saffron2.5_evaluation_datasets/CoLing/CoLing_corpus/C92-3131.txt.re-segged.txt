Introduction
This research deals with the representation f causal relations found in texts written in natural anguage  , in order for KALIPSOS\[1\] , an NL-understandlng and question-answering system  , to encode causal information in conceptual graphs so as to handle causal information and reasoning  . 
Naturalanguages such as French or English have many ways to express a causal relation  . It can be syntactic ( parce que / because ) or lexical ( provoquer/to produce )  , explicit or implicit ( Jemesuis cass de la jambeet jen ' aip aspu venir/l brokemy leg and I couldn't come  )  , contained in a single sentence or extended over a whole paragraph  . 
Being partlenlarly interested in explicitly stated causal information  ,   1 have studied interproposifional relations introduced by pareeque/because and puisque/stnce which are the more specifically causal e on juuct lons  . 
My approach differs from previous work on causality which was either an attempt to define causal re-latiuns in logic  ( \[2\] \[3\] \[4\] ) or the design of AI systems for planning and diagnosis  15\]  . My research is based on natural language understanding  . 
If one wants to retrieve and exploit causal information coded in NL-texts  , a semantic analyser that builds an adequate representation fcausalinks is needed  . The importance of this point has been underestimated  . For KALIPSOS , Sowa's Conceptual Graph theory \[6"I has been taken as a target representation model ; this model can be interpreted in logical terms , thus allowing deduction . Future research will use these interpretation rules and will exploit extra-ling ni~e knowledge for automated reasoning  . This subject is not addressed in this paper which focuses on the semantic analysis problem  . 
Part I explains that the main difficulty in representing the semantics of parce clue ~ because and puisque/since is the anchoring of the causal relation  . 
Parts II and III show how to deal with and represent this ambiguity on both syntactic and argumentative levels  . 
I-Problem
To begin with , it should be noted that this research has been done on the French language  . The enn-junction since , in English , raises other problems in addition to those raised bypuisque in French  , but they are not dealt with here . In this paper , since is never used to introduce a temporal relation  . 
Because of lack of space , I have assumed that the reader is familiar with So wa's Conceptual Graph model and notations  \[6\]  . 
Traditionally , cause is viewed as a two-argument relation . In the CG-model the relation " X has Y for cause * can be represented as follows  ( the concepts are written in boxes and the relations in circles  ) : When studying such a relation three tasks have to be performed : the first and second arguments  ( resp . 
X and Y ) have to be identified and the nature of the
CAUSE relation has to be determined.
1- Identifying the first argument ofparee que /becamse and puisque/since relations is trivial because these conjunctions introduce a dearly defined subordinate clause  . It would be much more difficult for conjunctions like eneffet/actually  , done/thus or afnst/so , for instance . 
2- Determining the nature of the relation is more complex  . A cause can be direct or indirect , es~ntial or incidental , deliberate or accidental , several factors might be involved , and a cause may vary according to the point of view  . But this question cannot be solved on purely semantic grounds  . The conjunctions I have studied , in partien lar , and naturalan-guage , in general , do not make a systematic distinction between these types of causes  . I assume that speakers and listeners either make do with a general  , basic causal relation or use complementary information about the world  . Therefore , in the KALIPSOS project ,   1 have chose not to ~ this question during the text encoding phase but to solve it either during the pragmatic analysis or  , if needed , during the question-answering phase ( information retrieval process )  , using extraling nistic knowledge .

The question is to know where to an-chef the causal relation in the main clause graph because this anchor may be ambiguous for two tea-sons  . 
? Syntactic level
Yeve uxquemenflisl'dpouse parcequ'elleest rtche  . 
I want my sonto marry her becauses he isrich.
This statement can be inteqneted in two different ways depending on the context : II Jeveux que menills I ~ #pouse parce qu ' elle est fiche  . ., aiasf , tl ne sera plus d ma charge . 
I want my sonto marry her because she is rich . ., that way I'll no longer have to support him . 
12 Jeveu x quemenflisr dpouse pare eq ~ ( ellest ficheet pas parceq ~ ilg aime . Les martages d'amour , jen'yerotspas . 
I want my sontom arry her becauses he isrich and not because he laves her  . Idort believe in lave matches . 
This syntactic ambiguity will be analysed in more detail in the second part of this paper  . 
? Argumentativelvel
The Btatement Hadel aflth ~ e/He has a fever can be considered from two points of view  , as a factor as the ~ . a kefsaction . 
-Giving the cause of a statement considemt as a fact produces an objective x planation as in :  I1 a delafld vrepare equ'llestmalade . 
He has a fever because he is sick.
where the information " heissick ' answers the question Pour quota-t-tl de lafldvre?/Why does he have a fever ?- Giving the cause of a statement considered as a speaker's action produces a justification  , im-plicating the speaker as in: I1 a delafld v repuis q~t lest toutrouge /
He has a fever since he is flushed l where the information " he is flushed " answers the question P our q noldls-tuq ~  ( tladela flLh , re?/Why do you say he has a fever ? The two intertnetatiom differ with respect othe?peaker 's argumentation : either he explains a factor he justifies himself  . This argumentative ambiguity will be explained in the third part of this paper where Is hall show how it can be represented in conceptual graph structures containing utterance type concepts  . 
Please note that " utterance " is used in the ~ nse of the act of uttering  , not that which is uttered . 
II-Syntactic ambiguity when anchoring causal relations  ( 1 ) Jeveux quemonflis g6pouse parce qu~el lest fiche . 
I want my sonto marry her becauses he isrich.
The ambiguity ( ll and 12 ) cotreJpondnto different syntactic analyses ( Al-broad ~ eope and A2-narrow ~ eope ) : AI\[Jeveux quemonfllsf~pouse\]parceq ~ elle riche  . 
\[I want my sonto marry her \] becauses he is rich  . 
A 2 Jeveuxque\[monillsg?pouse parceq ~ elle riche\]  . 
I want \[ mys onto marry her becauses hets rich \]  . 
Except for the case where the conjunction follows a comma  ( which rules out the second syntaetle analy-m )  , I suggest that the statement is totally ambiguous and that it is impossible to choose between these interpretations  o11 syntactic grounds . The parser must deliver two syntactic trees . 
The semantic analyser , however , must ry to choose one reading only . There is no guaranteed determining factor but some dues may combine in favour of one or other interpretation  . Three of these clues are shown below : coreferenee of pronouns  , temporal correspondence and encyclopedic knowledge  . 
Coreference of pronouns ( 2 ) J ' ald tt que Pier repartalt parce que cai at chant at t  . 
I said that Peter was leaving because he felt like It  . 
(3 ) J ' aidlt que Pier repart att parce que came e hantait  , I said that Peter was leaving because l felt like it  . 
Coreference of underlined pronouns favours the narrow scope interpretation for statement  ( 2 ) and the broad scope one for statement ( 3 )  . However , no interpretation is really ruled out . 
Although the definition of precise rules seems difficult and still has to be worked out  ,   1 think that this coreference is a factor in the cognitive process of natural disambiguation  . 
Temporal correspondence
It is useful to remember that an effect cannot precede its cause in time and that this temporal information can be computed  . It depends on the choice of tenses , on the aspeetual indications and on the situation characteristics given in the semantic definitions of the verbs  . Several models of temporal representation using conceptual graphs have been designed and implemented  \[7\]  . The ~ manticanaly ~- r canu ~ information to ~ b iguate a ~ a tement  . 
Jepense qu ' tlama ~ parce qu ' llyadu foutllis.
I think he has eaten becouse there is a mess.
The tense show that the messcomes after the action of eating  . Therefore , the mess cannot be the cause of that action and the narrow neope interprt  . ' tation in ruled out .

Encyclopedic knowledge
J'espdrequ't lvafaire be cat Farceque ~ b ~ ranckesten vacanees  . 
I hope the weather will be nice because l : ranck is on vacation  . 
Unless we accept a magic causality of meteorological phenomena  , everyone knows that clouds do not depend on Frauek's activity  . "llais information rules out the narrow scope interpretation for the above statement  . 
Common sense knowledge may be the most important factor of disambiguation  . So wa's model has tools to enende this kind of knowledge but the relevant information  , which is not semantic but prag-marie , must be defined in connection with a specific application  . 
For statement ( 1 ) and similar statement she parser must deliver two different analyses  . The semantic analysertries to remove the = tm bigt fity using a set of combined clues  . 
ll I-Argumentative ambiguity when anchor ing causal relations 
Suggested represent at lou
A statement such as ( 4 ) I 1est malade pulsq ~ ( tla detafl ~ vre . 
He iss fek since he has a fever.
cannot be paraphrased by 11 estmalade parceq dt la de lafl dvrc . 
He is sick because he has a fever.
which would contradict our basic knowledge of illness and fever  , it would be better to paraphrase ( 4 ) with one of the following statements : - Jed is ( pense , erois , suppose , etc . ) qu't lest malade parceq dt la de la fld vre . 
-Isay ( think , assume , imagine , etc . ) he is sick because he has a fever . ( meaning HeIssick and
I say so because he has a fever.)
These paraphrases bring out the speaker's activity which remains implicit in  ( 4 )  . Although there may be different kinds of activity  ( epistemic , cognitive , speech , etc . ) they shall all be considered here as utterances , ince the problem I wish to address is that of finding the proper structure to represent causal relations  . 
The above paraphrases how that statement ( 4 ) could be represented as follows : Figure 1 . Conceptual graph for " Hehsick since he has a fever F ': in lids graph  , the concept type of the U-node ( utterance ) is different from that of the Prop-nodes ( proposition )  . The U-node represenls the speech situation whose d reumetances form the dependency relations  . 

Several remarks can be made about the suggested representation  ,   1- Fever is no longer considered as a cause of illness  ; it causes the speaker's declaration 11 estmalade/Heissick . 
2-In figure 1 , proposition 1is not in the scope of U as it does not belong to its theme  . Actually , as O . Duero thas shown \[8\] , there are two successive utterances in a statement such as  ( 4 )  . This is easily explained if we acknowledge that the information introduced by puisque/since is already known  . As a presupposed piece of information it cannot be stated  ; in the representation I have chosen it cannot be the theme of an utterance  . 
3- The suggested representation shows that it is necessary to introduce a new type of concept  ( U ) in order to represent the speech situation ( which is not a proposition ) and the related linguistic phenomena . 
1 suggest that this type of concept will enhance the analysis of linguistic phenomena such as modality  , temporal relations , reported speech , or any facts dealing with the elreumstanees surrounding an utterance  . For instance , let us consider a woman who says to a child : Va dart stachambrel/Go to your room/This statement and its context could be represented by the graph shown in figure  2  . 
\[~--------~~-------~~ Figure 2 . Example : The relations SP and LIht-troduce the speaker and the listener  . The relation MOD indicates the speech modality . The large box represents a concept whose proposition type remains lmpliei LACTESDE  COL\]NG-92  , N , ~ brl ' Es . 2328^OLq " I992882 PROC . oi ; COLING-92, NAWn ~ S . AUG .  2328 ,   1992 I have shown how puisque/since statements might be represented  . I have also argued that it is necessary to introduce a U-type concept  ( U-node ) into the CG-modd so that utterance-related linguistic phenomena can be taken into account  . However , in order to represent interpropositional causal inks  , it must be possible to build the proper epresentation automatically  . Two questions follow : when is it neceessary to have a U-node in the graph of the main  danse7 Where should a causal relation be anchored in the modified  representation7 

Any sentence , written , spoken or even reported , is the responsibility of a speaker ( at this point , paragraph or text levels are not considered ) . This leads to a first rule : Rule I : A graph representing a sentence must depend on a U-node  . 
Any variation in the speech situation ( change in point of view , in assertiveness , etc . ) must also be indicated . The llst of variations is open but mainly concerns verbs  ( dire/to say , croire/Zo believe , penser/to think , etc . ) which introduce reported speech or a new point of view  . 
Rule 2: Verbs that hltroduce reported speech or a point of view must be defined as an utterance  ( U-type concept )  . 
Figures 3 and 4 give examples of the application of zules 1 and 2  . A further analysis of the utterance activity would refine and extend these rules because modality and other linguistic phenomena may interfere  . As we are not concerned here by the distinctions between the different kinds of utterance  ( episternic , belief , etc . ) and the interpretation rules associated with them  , we have left the modality of
U-nodes unresolved.

Verb ( to say ) is
Figure 4 . Example of the applicatim , of rule 2: straJcture of the deth filion of tonay ( unresolved modality is put in quote ~ )  . 

As the representation of the main elaine becomes more complex the number of anchoring po~fi " b flities increases and it is necessary to determine which ones are legitimate  . 
As already explained above , parce que/because and putsque/slnce differ more by the type of their first argument than the nature of the causal relation  . 
Parceque/becaz~erlations are usually anchored to a proposition whereas puts que/slnce relations are usually anchored to an utterance  . 
Rule 3: A causal relation expressed by pureeque/because must be anchored to a propositional node of a conceptual graph  . 
According to this rule , in the statement ( 5 ) Je disqt/ila de lafi ~ repure equ't leatmala de . 
I say that he has after because he issick.
anchoring can be done in two ways ( the statement is syntactically ambiguous ) leading to the graphs shown in figures 5 and 6 .

Puisque/since has additional ~ yntactic properties that limit the ways the causal relations can be anchored  . 
The following unacceptable ( * ) statements -* Est-ceputs qu'i lestmalad equaila delafi ~ vre ? ? Is it since he is sick that he has a fever ?- Est-cep or ceqz/tlestmal adeq ~ ilade lafl ~ vre ? Is it because he issick that he has fever ?-* Ha from nonpuisqu'i lest mala demaispuisqu ' ilaJommetL ? HeiscoMnot since he is sick but since he fee is sleepy  .

Conclusion
TI~study of parceque/because and puisque/since has shown that the question " Cause of what ?" is even more important than the question " What kind of cause  . ~ . The main task has been to uncover and represent the ambiguity  ( both syntactic and argumentative ) of these conjunctions . 
Although linguistic phenomena ( coreference of pronouns and tempond correspondence  ) and encyclopedic knowledge may help to ~ edu ~ the syntactic ambiguity  , there is no guaranteed determining factor . 
The importance of argumentative characteristics had to be taken into account  ; consequently I have introduced a new type of concept to xe present the utterance situation  . This concept type allows the parceque/because and puisque/sineer lations to be properly represented in the form of conceptual graph st to ctu~s  . In addition ,   1 have defined rules to allow the KALIPSOS semantic analyser to build mlehstn~ures automatically  . 
Further work has to be done . The example of the definition of dire/to say can be extended to encode other verbs  ( croire / to believe , penser/to think , supposer/to suppose , nierltodeny , etc . ) . It will be necessary to distinguish between differentypes of utterance nodes in conceptual graphs  . 
Since the conceptual ~ . xuctures that have been built must enable catutal questions to be answered  , it is also necessary to define rules so that the question/answering system can handle the utterance type concept nodes  .
