' Poday , several part-of-speech tagged corpora rereadily available for research use  . \ [ Iowever , because there is wide diversity of morphological information systems  ( word segmentation ~ part-of-speech system , etc . ) , it is ditficult to use tagged corpora with an incompatible morphological infm'mation system  . This paper propose same , hod of converting tagged corpora frOll loltell lorphellle system to all other  , 1 Introduction Recently , mm , y natural language processing researchers have concentrated on corpus-based approaches  . Linguistic corpora can be classified as word -segmented corpora  , part-of-speech tagged corpora , and parsed corpora , tle cause a part-of-speech tagged corpus is the most important corpus  , much corpus-based natural language processing research has been performed using part-of-speech tagged corpora  . 
I lowever , building a large part-of-speech tagged corpus is very dillicult  . It is even more difficult to build a corpus for languages without explicit word boundary characters  , such as Japanese . q ' herefore , researchers always complain of the scarcity of data in the corpus  . 
To solve this data scarcity problem , previous works proposed methods of increasing the productivity of the labor required for building a part-of-speech tagged corpus  .  \[1\] . 
' . l'hispaper proposes another method of acquiring large part-of-speech tagged corpora : restructuring tagged corpora by using morpheme adjustment rules  . This method assures good use of the sharable part -of-speech tagged corpora that are already awdl -able such as the ATR Dialog Database  ( ADD )  \[2 ;  3\] . 
Ideally , these corpora could be used by all researchers and research groups without any modifications  , l lowever , actual part-of-speech tagged corpora have the following problems : ? Diversity of orthography : A word can be spelled in various ways  . In Japanese , there are three types of character sets : kanji ( i  ~ . ~"-) , hiragana ( ~ to ~~) , and katakana (: ~ J  #: ~ J ?) . Also , people can use these character sets at their discretion  . 
? Diversity of word segmentation :
Because the Japanese language has no word boundary characters  ( i . e , blank spaces ) , there are no standards of word segmentation . A single word in a certain corpus may be considered nmltiple words in other corpora  , and vice versa . 
? Diw ; rsity of part of speech systems :
There are no standards for part-of-speech systems . It is true that a detailed part-of-speech system can help the application of part-of-speech information  , lint the labor required\['orlmilding corpora will continue to increase  . This problem is language-independent . 
Diversities of word segmentation and part-of-speech systems are fatal problems  . The simplest way to solve these problems is to perform a morphological analysis on the raw text in the corpus  , with no regard to the word segmentation adpart -of-speech infermation  . Uowever , making a high-quality morphological analyzer demands much time and care  . Additionally , it is wasteful to ignore the word segmentation and part-of-speech i  , fformation that h~s been acquired with much effort . 
In restructuring tagged corpora with nmrpheme ad -justmel  , trules , tim word-segrnentation and part-of-speech inlbrmation of the original corpus is rewrittm  , , making good use of the original corpus information  . 
" riffs method is characterized by reduced manual effort  . 
In the next section , the method of rest , rueturing tagged corpora is described in detail . Section 3 reports the result of an experiment in rewriting the corpus using this method  . 
2 Restructuring Tagged Colpora
Restructuring tagged corpora involves the following three steps : ? preparation of training set ? extraction of morpheme adjustment rules ? rewrith ~ g of corpora First  , sentences for the training set are chosen from the corpus to be rewritten  . New word segmentation and part-of-speech information  ( morphological information ) is given to the sentences by a morphological analyzer or by hand  . Consequently , the training set has two sets of morphological information for the same raw text  . Figure I shows an example of the training set . 
A large number of training sentence sidesirable , but preparing many sentences requires much time and effort  . Avms tnmn ber of sentences would be required to extend coverage to content words  ( such as nouns , w'A ) s , ete ) , but flmction aI words ( such as particles , auxiliary verbs , ere ) can be covered with a smaller number of sentences .

Correspoi Menees of Rewriting Units In languages without explicit word boundary characters  , such as Japanese , a single word in a certain morphological information system may be divided into multiple words  ( one-to-many correspondence ) in other morphological information systems , multi-piew ords may be unified ( many-to-one correspondence )  , or the segmentation of multiple words may be changed  ( many-to-many correspondence )  . Figure 2 shows these correspondences . 
We developed an algorithm to find these correspondences  ( Appendix A )  . By using this algorithm , morpheme rewriting rules ( Figure 3 ) can be extracted . 
2.2.2 Rules lot " Unknown Words
Rewriting rules such as those shown in Figure 3 can rewrite only the words that appeared in the training set  ,  . If the training set is small , the coverage of the rules will be limited . I lowever , because this n ~ or pheme adjnstment is a method of rewriting part-of-speech tagged corpora  , the treatment of unknown one-to-one\]"I\ [ l  ~  ( NOUN ) " o " JI l ~ sl ~ ( NOUN ) " one-to-many\]"~ ( V , qRB)"~"~(V-ST~M ) . . . . ~ (~ Nt~L )" \[ many-to-oriel "~ . ,~  ( NOUN ) " "~115~  ( NOUN ) " <~ "~/ \ ] \ ]~  ( NOUN ) "\[ hi~tny-to-lnally\]"m ( PAR'FICIA , ~) " v , ; 5 ( VERB)"~#"-Cv , ( AUXV-STEM ) . . . . -5 (\[ NFL)"

Rules for unknown words without word segmentation changes between two morphological information systems can be extracted automatically from one -to-one correspondence rules in the rewriting rules  . 
Rulest brunk nown words with word segmentation changes can also be extracted automatically by using information concerning the length of the word's characters  . For examph ' . , when a single verb with two characters in a certaiu morphological information system corresponds to two words  ( verb-stem with one character and verb-inflection with one character  ) in another morphological information system , the following rewriting rule is extracted .

The heuristic knowledge of character sets that an ordinary Japanese morphological nalyzer uses  ( such as " katakana words are usually proper nom , s " , " verbi Mleetion words are spelled using hiragana  "  , etc . ) are also available in this nlorpheme adjustment ted>nique  .

In effect , the original corpus is converted to a new eorptls that uses a different morphological information system  .

3 . 2 Rewriting of Morphological Information The experiment was performed bidirectionally between the morphological information system of the ATt ~ Dialog Database  ( ADD ) and the morphological information system of unification-based Japanese grammar  . 
3.2.1 From Unification-Based Granmxar to

This experiment rewrites from a medimn-graiued morphological information system to a coarse -grained morphological information system  . Table : 1 . 2 . 1 shows the result of this rewriting . The segmentation error rate and part-of-speech error rate were calculated using the same definition in  \[1\]  . Table 2 shows the result . 
The error rates seem to be rather large , but it should be noted that only simple knowledge sources are used both illour method  ( the morpheme adjuster ) and by the morphological naly zer . Also , it is significant that our targets are spoken -style Japanese sentences  . Ordinary morphological analyzers can analyze written-style Japanese sentences with a less than  50_/o error rate , by using richer knowledge sources \[ I\] . 
However , previous work reported that the error rate for automatic morphological nalysis of the ADD text is more than  15%\[6\]  . 
hi comparing the two methods , the part-of-speech error rates of our method are clearly better than those of the morphological nalyzer  . This shows that our method can make good use of tile original part-of-speech information  . 
3.2.2 From ADD to Unlficatlon-Based
Japanese Grammar
This experiment is more difficult because this rewriting is from the coarse-grained morphological infor-nlation system to the medium -grained morphological information systeln  . Table 3 shows the result . 
The part-of-speech error rates of our method are better in this rewriting experiment  , oo . 
4 Conclusion
This paper proposed restructuring of tagged corpora by using morpheme adjustment rifles  . The even-tua I goal of this work is to make precious knowledge sources truly sharable among many researchers  . Tile results of tile experiment seem promising . 
Our rnorp benlead justment method has some re -semblaace to Brill's part-of-speech tagging  method\[7\]  . 
Brill's simple part-of-speech tagger call be considered a morpheme adjnster that adjusts differences between initial  ( default ) tags and correct ta~s . 
As Brill applied his part-of-speech tagging technique to t be syntactic bracketing  technique\[8\]  , we believe that our method can be applied to the adjustment of parsed corpora  . In the work of Grishman et al\[9\] , tree rewriting rules to adjust differences between TreeBank and their grammar were probably prepared manually  . By applying our method to parsed corpora , such rewriting rules call be extracted automatically  .
