In this paper I propose a Binding rule for the identification of pronoun and anaphor referents in phrase-structure trees  , assuming the general framework of lheGovernment -binding theory outlined by Chom  , ; ky (1981) . The Binding rule , specified by means of an attribute grammar , is a particular instantiation of the Free Indexing rule and binding axioms in Chomsky's Binding theory  , with certain empirical and practical advantages . The complexities of the Binding rule proposed , as well as that inherent in Chomsky's Binding theory  , are studied , and it i ~ shown that the new rule is more psychologically plausible and cornputationally efficient than the original theory on wtfich it is based  . 
The fragment of the attribute grammar shown here is part of an English grammar and parser being developed in tile Prolog and PLNLP languages  . 

Binding is a component subtheory of Government -binding which applies in the derivation of the logical form of utterances from their surface rcpre-sentation  . The area of semantic interpretation dealt with by the binding theory is that of anaphora  . 
Binding theory defines only syntactic onditions on anaphora  ; the reader is referred to/Hobbs ,   1978/ for some of the extra-syntactic factors that might be involved  . Binding assumes an Indexing rule which applies to an input S-Structure tree and annotates it  , assigning to every NP node hathein put tree a referential index  , which represents the corefere nee relation ot the NP with other NPs in the input  . 
In this paper research is continued on the use of attribute grammars to provide a fully explicit and computationally oriented statement of the Gover nmc  . nt-binding ( GB ) theory/Correa , 1987/ . 
The Binding rule presented here improves over the standard statement of the Binding theory in two respects : From an empirical point of view  , the new rule accounts for cross over binding phenomena/Kuno  ,   1987/ without recourse to reconstruction/Chomsky , 1981/; from a practical point of view , the new rule is more computationally sensible than the generate-and-test approach understood in Chomsky's theory  , and hence is a plausible candidate for incorporation in natural language parsers that account ot anaphora  . Previous literature on GB parsing/We hrli , 1984; Sharp , 1985; Kashk et , 1986; Kuhns , 1986; Abney ,   1986/has not addressed the issue of implementation of the Binding theory  ) The present paper intends in part to fill this gap  . 
In the development below I will assume that the reader is thmiliar with attribute grammars and the basic concepts and terminology of Government -binding  , although not necessarily with the Binding theory . The reader is referred to Waite and Goos ( 1984 ) for a concise introduction to attribute grammars , and Sells (1985) for the basic assumptions of

Chomsky's Binding Theol T
Binding theory defines the syntactic on straints on coreferenee that exist between the noun phrases in a sentence  . In the courseot " doing this , thE the my indirectly determines constraints on the distribution of certain kinds of noun phrases  . In this section we review the standard formulation of the Binding theory  ; tile reader already familiar with it may proceed to the next section  . 
The ret ~ rential possibilities of a noun phrase depend on the fimetional type of the NP and the Binding conditions for that type  . Government-binding distinguishes three types of over tNP  , shown in (1) . 
ISharp ( 1985 ) checks correclness of binding in traces ; we consider lexical NPs here . 

O ) a . anaphor ( reflexive and reciprocal ) b . pronominal c . referential An anaphor is an expression that has no independent reference madmust take its reference from some other expression in the sentence in which it occurs  . English has reflexive and reciprocal anaphors , such as ' themselves ' and " each other " in (2) . The NP from which an anaphor or pronominal takes its reference is called its antecedent  , since an anaphor must have an antecedent within the sentence in which it is used  , we obtain the contrast between (2 . a ) and (2 . b ) . If there is no appropriate antecedent , the string is ill-formed at the Logical Form level  . The antecedent of the anaphor must , furthermore , c-command the anaphor and be found within a certain local domain  , notions to be made precise below . Thus , in (2 . c ) , although there is a potential antecedent for the anaphor  , namely ' Greeks ' , it is not within the required local domain . 
In (2 . d ) , there is a potential antecedent " donkey ' , but it does not c-command the anaphor . Hence : i ~ estring is also ill-formed . 
(2) a . Greeks like themselves/each other.
b . * Each other/Themselves like Greeks.
c . * Greeks i think that each otheq/themselves i are smart  . 
d.*E very man who owns a donke yi beats itself.
A pronominal is a pronoun in any of its inflected forms  ( e . g . , as due to agreement and Case-marking ) , as in (3) . Pronominals exhibit a distribution in phrase structure trees nearly complementary to that of anaphors  . A pronominal need not pick its reference from some other NP in the sentence  , but rather may have independent ( deictie ) interpretation , as in the first reading of (3 . a ) . The pronominal may also be read anaphorically , having its reference determined by some other NP in the sentence  ( 3 . a-b ) . In tlf is case , though , the antecedent must either be outside the local domain of the pronominal  , or not c-command it . Hence , the assigned coreference in (3 . a-b ) is possible , while that in (3 . c ) is not . 
Within a local domain , where an anaphor must have an antecedent , a pronominal cannot . 
(3) a . Brigittei said that Shelli is tired.
b . Every man who owns a donke yi beatsiti.
c . * Sibyllei loves heri.
Lexical or fully referential expressions are names like " John " and " the man " in  ( 4 )  ; the class in chldes all nominals headed by a common or proper noun  . 
A referential expression defines its reference independently and must be free in every domain  , in the sense that it may not have ac-commanding antecedent  . Tiros the interpretations in (4 . a-b ) are unwarranted . Coreference between referential NPs is possible only if the first NP does not c-command the second  ( 4 . c-d ); the result , though , may be awkward or place emphasis on the anaphoric noun phrase  . 
(4) a .* Johnilikes Johni.
b . *. lohn i wants that John i leaves.
c . The man who hired Johni likes.lohni.
d . Johnicame and . lohnileft.
The most difficult area of the Binding theory is the tbrmulation of the notion local domain referred to above  . This notion is defined such that it is identical for anaphors and pronouns  . We note in advance , however , that while the notion is nearly identical for both  , it should not be defined the same , as sentences (5 . a-b ) show ( Chomsky , 1986) . 
In this paper we shall not be concerned with the solution of this still open problem  .

b . The childrenilike the iqpictures.
Chomsky's axiomatic statement of the Binding theory is as tollows  . Chomsky ( 1981 ) assumes a Free Indexing rule which appfies at LF and assigns  ( randomly ) a referential index to every NP in tim input structure  . Two NPs are said to be coreferential if they bear the same referential index  . 
The index hlg rule massively overgenerates logical forms  , and indiscriminately assigns unwarranted coreference relations  . The annotated struct ttresproduced by the rule are subject to a number of wellformedness conditions  , which are constraints on the assigned coreference rlations  . 
The most elementary condition is the agreement condit km  ( 6 )  . The main component of the theory is given by the Binding axioms  ( 7 )  , where timnotions of binding and local domain are as in  ( 8 ) and ( 9 )  , respectively . Notice that the definition ( 9 ) of local domain does not distinguish between anaphors and pronominals  , and thus is problematic , as the examples (5) indicate . We assume this definition , though , for the development below . 
The notion of c-command used in ( 8 ) is given in ( 10 )  , If NP l and NP2 are coindexed , then their agreement features AGR = < Person , Gender , 
Number > agree.
(7) Binding Axioms (8) (9)
A . An an apkor must be bound within its local domain . 
B . A pronomb , almust be free within its local domain . 
C . A referential expression must be free in every domain  . 
For nodes a and f l , a binds\[1 if ( i ) a is coindexed with f l , and ( ii ) ac-commands ft . 
A node a is free ( within a given domain ) if it is not bound ( within that domain )  . 
The local domain of a node a is the subtree dominated by MGC  ( a )  , where MGC (~) , the minimal governing category of a , denotes the maximal projection  #nearest to ? z such that / ~ dominates a  , and /~ has an accessible Subject , and/L dominates a governor ~ of a ( to ) For nodes a and \[1 , ae-commands\[I if the firsi ; branching node dominating a also dominates ft . 
It is a straightforward task to verify that the Binding axioms in  ( 7 ) explain the grammaticality judgements and interpretation possibilities of the examples presented thus far  , except those in (5) . 
The theory is explanatorily adequate , in the sense that it applies to a wide range of natural anguages  . 
Procedt ~ ralBinding
The Binding theory just outlined follows the style of most recent work within the Government-binding framework  . Extremely general rules , such as the Free Indexing rule , are assumed for the generation and annotation of syntactic structure  ; the bulk of the grammar then consists of wellformedness conditions or axioms that must be satisfied by the generated structures  . This approach : due to it: ; extreme in efficiency , is problematic as a model of linguistic performance or natural anguage parsing  . It seems more appropriate to view the general rules and axioms that constrain them as I figh -level specifications of certain grammatical processes  , rather than as models of how the processes are actually carried out  . 
The refinement of the general rules and axioms associated with them into procedural rules which may be used to derive structure that already satisfies the axioms is not a straightforward task  , and has only recently begun to be addressed / Abney and Cole  , 1986; Barton ,  1984/ . The incorporation of axioms into the rules leads to grammars which are more sensitive to psychological issues/linguistic processing  , rather than mere linguistic description . 
It seems clear that only these new rules may be used in practical natural anguage parsers  . Furthermore , the formulation of procedural mechanisms provides a new way of looking at linguistic phenomena  , which may in turn lead to insights for the solution of outstanding problems  . I offer the following Binding rule as an illustration  . 
The Binding rule is defined by means of attribution rules associated with productions in the base  . It applies at S-Structure and assigns to each NP node in the structure a referential index  , in such way that the Binding axioms are satisfied by the assignment  . 
The generate-and-test method implicit in Chomsky's account is avoided  . In those S-Structures for which there is no possible correct assignment  , ile rule blocks , and the structures are marked ill-formed , due to some violation of the 13 inding theory . The rule applies after the time-tional type of every NP has been determined  , according to lexical features of the head nominal and principles of the Government and Case theories  . Functional classification of an NP consists of determining the values of its attributes an apkoric and pronominal/van Riemsdijk and Williams  ,  1986/ . The first approximation to the rule is limited to cases of backward reference only  ; assignment of forwardeo reference , as in ( Il L will not be covered by the rule . Also , we ignore cases where referential expresskms may be used anaphorically  , as in (4 . c-d) .

The formulation of the rule relies crucially on the following hypothesis : For every NP node in an S-Structure  , it is possible to define two sets of nominal expressions AAS and PAS  , which contain , respectively , potential anaphoric and pronominal antecedents . Given a mechanism to compute the two sets noted , an antecedent for the current node may be selected from the appropriate set  , according to the current node's functional type , as in (12) . 
Attribution rule ( 12 ) is associated with every pro-duetion for NP and defines the value of the NP's referential index  . The functions e & ct-from takes an ordered set as argument and selects  ( arbitrarily ) the
NP2(J2) BindingRule:
NP . Reflndex , - if NP . anaphoric then if NP . pronominal then /* Control */ else select-from ( AAS ) else if NP . pronominal then seleet-from ( PAS ) else NP . node The main component of the Binding rule consists of the attribution rules that define the values of the AAS and PAS sets at each node  . I now proceed to describe the types of the attributes involved in the computation and the manner in which these values are defined  . 
Binding attributes and their types
Assume integer-valued attributes node and Re /Index  . The attribute node is associated with every node in an S-Structure tree  , enumerating them in preorder . Thus the node number of an NP may be used to identify the NP  . Reflndex repres-ents the referential index of the NP with which it is associated  . This attribute is synthesized by rule ( 12 ) and its value is equal to the referential index of the first NP with which the current NP corefers  ( assuming a preorder enumeration of tree nodes )  . 
When NP . Ref Index =  NP . node , for some NP , we say the NP has independent reference . 
The attribute AAS contains , for a given NP , the sequence of c-commanding NPs found within the local domain of the current node  . Thus , any NP in this set is a potential antecedent for the current node  , if that node is anaphoric . Each element in the AAS is a pair of the form < NP  . Reflndex , NP . AGR > , for some NP to the left of the current node . NPs are ordered in the AAS in such way that the most recently found NP is ranked first  ( AAS is a stack , or ordered set ) . The attribute IMS is similar to the AAS , except that each element in it either does not c -command the current node  , or is outside its local domain . Thus , each NP in the PAS is a potential antecedent for the current node  , if that node is pronominal . 
An important difference between the AAS and PAS is that  , if the current node is an NP , say NP i , the pair < NP i . node , NPi . AGR > is a member of PAS , but not AAS . Because of this , a pronominal's referential index may be set to its own node number  ( i . e . , may be interpreted deictically ) , while an anaphor's may not . This difference between the AAS and PAS need not be stipulated as a special case  , but rather follows naturally if we assume the c -command relation is irreflexive  . 
The distribution of values tor the AAS and PAS attributes in an SoStructure may be illustrated hymeans of example  ( 13 )  , ill which the subscripts are NP node numbers ; we ignore their actual values . 
(13 ) Johnhtold\[hisi parents\]j about himselfk . 
The values that result for the AAS and PAS are shown in  ( 14 )  ; the reader may verify their correct-hess with the aid of  . examples (15) . For the tirst NP , " John ' , there is no potential anaphoric antecedent (15 . a ), so the AAS is empty (14 . a) . 
I lowever , at that position it is possible to have a free pronoun  , so the PAS contains a single erthy , the pair < h , AGR h > . For the second NP , " his ' , the values of AAS and PAS areas in (14 . b ) . Thus the AAS is empty and no anaphor is permissible at the position  ( 15 . b ) , while a pronoun is , in which case it may be interpreted deictically or anaphorically  , referring back to " John ' . The values of the AAS and PAS attributes associated with NP i and NP k are as shown in  ( 14 . c-d) .
