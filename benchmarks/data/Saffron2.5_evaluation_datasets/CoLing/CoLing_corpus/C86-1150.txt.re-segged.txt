Computer Aided T ~ anslation ( CAT ) research at Universiti Sa~mMalsysL ~ ( USM ) began in 1976 as an individual researche ffcet . However , at that time , the work is more appropriately classified under hat  , real language data ~ cessing , including topics such as ' istilah ' ( temdnalogy ) information retrieval ,   , Malay ~ otf(~mextraction , parsing of Malay sentences using contextfreeg~sn ~sasd Malay language teaching tools\[Tong  78  , 
Chang 78\].
In 1978 , research into CAT was initiated , and by 1979 , the researchers a ~ U~4 began to develop g ~ mmmr medels for F ~ qglish to Malay translation using the software tool ~\[ GETA  78\]  . 
In 1980 , a natior ~ lwc~k shop was conducted in USM , where a pilot English to Malay tr ~ uslatlon system was desmnstrated  . 
Financialsup ~ mt beckons available , and li~ther development on the basic translation model was ca~ied out\[Tong  82  , van K linken 84 , zshar in 84\] . 
In 1984 , a per~nanent Computer-Aided-@ranslation Project unit was setup at  U~4  , and full-time research staff were assigned to this project  . Members of this project group now include t ~ o computer scientists  , one linguist , and five lexicographer/edit ~/ te ~ minologlst . '\[ his group was assigned the task of producing alabm  , atory ~ ototype for Englisll to Mal ~ translation  , and the result of their efforts is presented in this report  . 
S~stem Envlro~ment
The AK\[ANE system . is an integrated software environment for cemput er ~ alded-translatlon  , including tools for compiling grammes and dictionaries  , and fer processing corpus of the source and tm~et texts  . The CAT concepts beldnd this system is wellknown and weE-documented\[Boltet and Vauquols  1985\]  . 
This softwaPe has been prog~ammd using different levels of computer Isngnmges  , from IBM assembly ( PL360) to PL/I , and making extensive use of system tools of the IBM VM/CM~~stem-XEDIT and EX ~  .   ( ~e of its advantages is efficiency ( a scemDared to other similm , aystems ) , which means that it can execute with reasonable speed even on a combatively sa~ll compute m system  . 
USM's experience ~ ith the ARIANE systemires been vary satisfactery  , and we doubt very much . if another ~ ystem cot ~ ld have been mdg rated as d utillsed at this University with similar success  . Althou $ ~ theme lind been s~me criticisms about ARIANE in the literature  , our experience has sho ~ that in splte of its recognised weaknesses and drawbacks  , it remains a next r ~ lypowem gul and practical set of tools f ~ r the development of CAT systess  . Of course , the methodology pioneered at GETA\[Vanquois 75\] has been incorF~mated inton inny'new'systems today  . 
On the physical side , the ARIAN ~ system itself occn pies about 8 M byte of secondary storage , while the use mn~cldnerequiwesm\]o them 5 Mbyte for storing the linguistic data ( grammar models and dictionaries , but not including the source and target texts and their intermediate : ~ esults  )  . Avi ~ tlmlm ~ movy size of 2M bytes is used f ~ . the execution of all the trasslations f~n ~ qglish to Malsy  desc1~bed in this rep ( mt . 
Translation Model and Executinn Time
The ~% glish to Malay translation system consists of three main diction m  , ies-source English , Engllsh-Malay transfer , target Malay-andi ~ Ivegr ~ mmr models . The size of these various components are as follows: 

Sotu . celexieals : 5,000
Target lexicals : 4,000
Grssmar models : (11 , 0 o0 w~de ) (9 , 000 w~de ) lines rules nDr~0hologIcal analysis 600   90 struct un ~ alanalysis 5600   300 structural transfer 800   47 structural generation 1700   120 marphuloglcs/generation 900   120 The execut in n time for translation is estimated at  1  . 0097 Mild ( million of instructions per word ) . This is consistent with times measured at GhTA , Grer ~:) ble\[Boitet and VauqtD is 81~\] . In prast l calterms , tld a means that on U~4's I~44381 system ( estimated at 2 . 1MIPS ), the . translation time is approx ~ l~tely 0 . 48 second of ~ . h ~ tual CPUtJ , leper word . This fignme is based on the translation time for about  3  , 000 wn?dstakeni~n the selected text .

2. The Qualitz of Translation
Gradin ~ Scheme
In orde~to assess the ' quality ' of the translation output  , a grading scheme ( from grade A to grade F ) was devised using a sentence as the benn dary of assessment  . This scheme is based on the ease of posfi-edit ~ ig the translation output  , and not on the quality urstandard of trsaslation in the inure usual sense  . 
Currently , there is no estahlished method of evaluating ccrnputer-alded-trass latlon or mechanical translation output  . 
Fase of post-editlng is a measure which also takes into account the ease of understsnding as we\]/ as the accuracy of translation  . 
Two impurtant fact , s which affect say grading scheme is the typology of the source text itself as d the expert knowledge of the evaluatur in that particular area of text  . Some method of evaluating the ease of undurst and lng of the source text and scme definition of a neutral evaluator are ~ urequls iten to shyst as dardlsed evaluation scheme  . 
% ~ legrading scheme proposed in this report is a measure of the time required to edit sentences translated by the cc ~? outer  , ranging 9 tom fast ( as in grade A where no pest-editing is reqtdred ) to slow ( as in grade F where a sentence has to be retranslated manually  )  . There has been no attempt to catag~mise the source sentences into different degrees of difficult yur length  . Hence , the typology of text used in this evaluation must be burne in mind when assessing the overall results  . Although grades are assigned to ~ n dividual sentences  , the source texts were extracted by paragraphs , and hence , the continuity of the text is maintained . The actual grading itself was carried out by more  th2m one individual in urder to reduce ( as much as possible ) the effect of individual ' bias ' . After careful scrutiny , it was concluded that variation in the results obtained is within expected limits  , thus allowing broad conclusions to be drawn on the effectlveness/usefkflness of the translation ~ stem  . 
The grades assigned to translated sentences are as follows : A : ~ ect translation  , no modification required . 
B : list of alternative wurds selected by post -editur  . 
C : understasdable translation ( with preservation of meaning )  , single word correct lens without reference to source text  . 
D : as in C , but referencs to source text is necessary . 
E : major modifications with reference to source text  . 
F : retrass lated menu a ~.
Results for Selected Area and Text
AC~lemistry textbook fcmup per secondary school was chosen as the first text for the development of the laber at em-y prototype  . A total of 393 sentences were extracted at rasds n from this textbook and translated by the cemputer  . The translation output is then graded by three htmen post-editors as d the result given below is based on their ccm bimed evaluation  . 
Grade : A B C D E F
No . of sentences 61 125 1148 58O
Percentage % 153 229 2220
Cumulative % 15 47 76 98 100 100
The above result shows that 76 % of translated sentences are ' understandable ' ( no reference to English source text is during pest-editing  . 
Effect of a C ~ in Area and ~
The new text is a University level Cemputer Science textbook  , h ~ mu which 207 sentences were e ~< tracted , translated by the computer , and then graded . The result is as follows:
Grade : A B C D E F
No . of sentences 234 474 41 ii 14
Percentage % II 2136 2057
Ctm~lative % ii 32688893i00
As expected , the qus31ty of translation in tints case is lower than that furthe Chemistry text  . Most of the additional problems encountered can be solved either throu~ldictioss rycoding ur minor modifl catiens in the grEmmmr  . With these changes , the qtm31ty of translation for the Computer Science text is expected to be raised to the sane level as that furthe 
Chemistry text.
3. Emlstlr ~ Problems Classification
An attempt was made to analyse the problems encountered  , i . e . the errurs in translation output . This involves a tedious process of correctly identItyiog the source of each ereor found in the trasslation output  , and then classifying then according to the phase of translation  ( i . e . analysis , trass furor generation ) at which they occur . The purpose is to identify simple problems which can be solved in the existing system through modifications to the linguistic data  , while more c~plex ~ oblams can be the subject of further research  . This analysis of errors & Iso provides statistical infsrmation on their distribution and importasce  , hence giving some guidelines as to their priority for furthur investigation  . 
The Anal Xsis Phase
The problems of a , bigui ~ and coordination account for more than l ~ qlf of the errors at the ~ aly alsplmse  . The probl~n of ~ m ~ i guity here refers to smbi~t ies which remain unresolved at the end of analysis and to cases of erroneous d ls ~nblguation  . 
This type of problem is by far the most important , accounting furclose to 50 percent of the e~isting errors found in the anslysis phase  . 
Ambiguities which remain unresolved include vurb / noun  ( ' foam 1' , ' wurks ' , ' use ') , verb/adjective (' direct ' , ' total ') , verb/yen (' . . is unglazed paper . . ' ) , noun/adjective (' routine ' , ' plural ') , vemb/vlng (' . . painting of . . . '), adJ/pronoun('other ') . 

Courdinatien ( apposition , inclusion ) is a serious structuz , al Droblem not Imndled particularly well by the existing gra  , mar model . Many different types of elements can participate in coordination  ( apposition , inclusion ) and exsmplss of cases not considered in the current grammar are : complex noun phrases  , prepositions , 
V ~' ~ . l clauses , interrogatives , adjunct phrases . 
(' to ~ dfk~m and within .   .  ' ) ( '  .   .   . but .   .   .   .   . and .   .   .   .   . ') (' why .   .   .   . and do .   .   .   .  ' ) ( '  .   . hot and humid . . ' ) 0tber ex . rors in the analysis plmse are re/ative \] yless cemplex and can be solved throu~l modifications or im~movements in the morphological and sta'uctl ~' alanalysis ~ am~l  , s and in the coding of the source dictior ~ my .

The ~ gomadn ~ roblems at the Imass fea , phase are the Jnc~nplete for incorrect ) choice of target lexl cals , and the t ~ ansfer of

The diss~bi ~ uation of a sourcel ~ ical which car ~ y m are than one meaning and which is t ~ anslated bY different target lexicals accounts for more tlmn half of tile stagers at transfer  . % ~ le source of this problem is actlm33~ at the ~ lalysls ~ lase , which was unable to ~ moduce a suPficiently deep level of intexT metation  ( e . g . se ~ sntics and sesmntie relations ) to solve the ~ bJ ~ uity which manifests itself only attrm\]sfer  . 
The two categories of words which are most problematic are the verbal : \['  ( X ~ llS ( ' ~ eveal ' , ' assa , e ' , ~ call ') and the ~ cepositians (' in ' , ' by ' , ' to ') . Although dis~bi ~ uation rules based on context are ~ s ~ loyed du ~ the structural transfer phase  , they can only solve relatively st ~ a~tfca ~ ard cases  . For the more dlff:t culteases , the current av ~ oach of displaying a list of multiple choices of words to the human posteditor seems to be t / ~ e most acceptable solution  . Much deeper work in state semantics and semantic relations will imve to be carried out into im~x  ) ve on this . Even if such improvements are found , there is still tlle question of weighing the cost of such sopldsticatod in ~ cessing by the cempute a "   ( which is expected to be very high ) a ~ nst the cost of l~m ~ postediting . 
Id~o , mtic expressions are nc~ms / . lycoded directly in the source dictio , ~ ry . Unfortunate \] . y , the ARI/d~softw ~ does not\[movide suZficJent facilities at analysis or at transfer plmse to cater for scs ~ of the c~D lex manipulations requi~ed  . S~meidiomatic expr(~ssions are ambiguous ( i . e . they can be conside x ~ didlc~atic only incemtalu context  )  , and hence , there is tlle problem of ( ~ samb ~ uat ~\] gth CS ldlIvID . gana \]$ sis . Also , scsleEnglishidi ~ tic 6~pressions are particularly diCficult to trass late into Malay  , and perhaps other target l ~% ~ mges as well . 
The Gene ~ ation Phase
Er~s during structaral generation are relatively few  , and also relatively minor 9rc ~ the point of view of postediting . 
Most errors dax dng this phase will give rise to grade C sentences if there are no other type of ~ s in the sentence  . 
The main ~ obl~ns are as follows : ** Podition of elements in cc~plex noun phrase  . 
Most of the ex~o~s are dim to the incc~'ect placement of the ~ e position ' b ~\ [ J '  ( similar I . o'of'but not a sccmn only used ) in a complex MaI~vnomlpl ) rase . Othere\] . 6ments of the noun phrase which give rise to errors are the '- lag ' or '- an ' f~n used as ~ adjective  , sad tlle lexicals ' other ' and ' only ' which seem difficult to tra~slate into Y ~ lay  . Very often , m ~ adjective JnMalay is introduced by the relative pronoun ' yasg '  . However , thrum sccns to be no consistent rule for this . Certain lexicals always require a ' yang ' , ~lleothers only undex , cart ~ tunot well-defined condliions .

* ~ Relative clause introduced by a prepasition.
the relative clause introduced by aiz , epesition (' in which ' , from where ' , etc . ) is psrt ~ cular . ly difficult to translate into Mola ? ( even for htmT ~ ntmanslatcm )  . For n~ll ~% ~ tistic study is being carried out into possible targets true tm'es  . T~ds is one specific case whereh5 r linguistic research is initiated s~ccifically to cater for the needs of cemputer-aided -trasslation  .

The probl ~ , ~ of coordination during analysis and lexical ~ n biguity ck mlngImans femare at a deepers ~ r ~ntics level  . Until formal . linguistic work on semantics ( such as Montagne G ~ ammr ) can come up with same pract lc ~ solution , these problems are only amenable to al ~% flstice r ~ nee ~ ap ~ ach based on some static categnrisation of semantics together with some generalised dynsmic method of processing and the ability to l~idle exceptional cases  . 
The current Ea~lish analysis model a\] re2~ contains a very difficult cases which still r~dn unresolved at the end of analysis  , exhaustive sea ~ ch method can be employed . This is not as costly asitimg y seem , since a survey of such cases has indicated that good heu ~ is tlcconditions mR possible to recklce the overall search time  . 
~he current ~ Llys is model attempts to achieve a deep level of interpretation right up to logical and semantic relations  . 
Since tluts level rosy not be attainable for many of the sentences in a particular text  , a lower level of int ~ etation such as syntactic f~nctions aceven mo~phs syntactic classes should be used instead  . A large proportion of such sentences can still be translated ccr ~ ectly  , and there/c~e , the rmovlsion of this's a fetynet'is essential . 
The development of an industrial prototype will demmnda considerable increase in the size of the dictionary  , at least to about 10 , 000 source lexlcal units . Hence , lexicograph lc work represents the single most important and tlme-cousumisg task in the development of an imdustrial prototype  . Preparations are alresdy under way to si~llfy this task by li ~  ) ducing a simplified farm ( or questiomaire ) which can be filled-up by lexicographers with perhaps only a minimal emount of traln ~  . Data frem this ' form ' can then be transferred into computer codes to be used by the translation s ~ stem  . 
This I reporation of acc~puteutsed dictionary can also be integrated with any work belng carried out on lexical databases for ordinary ~ cmmn consumption  . The two tasks have a large Em~xm t of intersect ~nglnformation needs  , and hence , can be mntually beneficial . 
Towards an Industrial Protot ~
The lab ( matory l ~ rototype is now ready for development into an industrial I motot ~ p e  . % ~ ie first task is of course the drm vlngup of a list of possible applications  , followed by a feasibility study of the text typology for each of these application  . The fins/selection will be based on the quality of trans\]ation which can be expected and the type of financial support available  . 
Other important considerations include : the volt ~e of Iman Blationwaek  , the frequency of translation wQr k , the urgency/speed of the translation w~k , the availability of accmplete set of Malay technical terms  , the availability of text matez dals in machlne -readable format  . 
Once an application Iresbeen selected , the next step is the onganlsation of the development % ~ rk itself  . Hare , the available man power is a critical element , and from experience , it is very difficult to convince policy makers and financial supporters on this  . Any c~velopment teem must be made up of hlgh -call bre computational linguists  , computer scientists , lexlcoguaphers , editors sud translators , who must be ~ ll-tralned in them ~ thodology of ccmputor-alded-translation besides their own area of special is at lon  . 
Another ~ Tportant factor for planning purposes is the time reqtdmed to develop an Industrisl prototype  , and this has also been frequently underestimated . It is estimated that at \] . east 3 years work by the existing research teem at Unl verslti Sales  Mals3  , sla will be x ~ qui ~ ed to complete an industrial prototype for  ~4~lish -Mala ~ translation in one specific area of application  .
