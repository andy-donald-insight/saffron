! ~ An unproblematic example
The first example illustrates the merging of a part of speech analysis with a functional analysis  , ltltPart of speech analysis and the onl ine principle A part of speech analysis consists in the assignment of category labels to lexicai units  . By adding parsing rules to the categorial an a lysis one could also carry out the next step of @ rouping those lexical units into la rger synta~atic units  , The principle governing the part of speech analysis is the onllne principle :  , syntagmatic units are analysed from the left to the right without changing the word order ~? Example:  ( I ) Harry promised meanew car ( ' " ) Is ~ H  ~ , y ~ Cv Pr?mised J/~o = eli ~ Ta\]\[Anew\]C . car ?\] lt2t Functional anal Esie and the dependency princ iple functional analysis consists in the assignment of function labels to synta~natl c units  . 
The principle governing the functional analysis is the dependency principle : every syntaEmatic unit  ( ~sentence )  -  95 -contains one and only one lexical unit functioning as its head ? 
Example : ( I ")
SUJG0 VI0DO
GOVI promised JI
Harrymea GOV car
I new
The sister nodes of each GOV-node are either terminal nodes  , in which case there is no function label specified ? cf  . the node of the indefinite artic-le . 
or nonterminal nodes , in which case the function label takes one of the following values : SUJ  , DO , IO , ~ F (= modifier) ,   . . . 
The function labels specify the kind of relation holding between the head and its dependents ? Por instance  , " Harry " is the subject of " promised " , " new " is a modifier of " oar " , etc . 
1,3, A synthetic representation
Assumption : the part of speech analysis and the functional analysis can be represented in the same tree  , since the onllne principle and the dependency principle are compatible  .   . 
Example : ( I )
II1i, . ov JIC a . l ~" Harry meal new- 96   -2 tA problematic example : the result clause I'll beco~erned with the external structure of the result clause only  , not with its internal structure ; the result clause will , consequently , be treated as an unanalyeed synt~gmatic unit . 
2 , 1 , A part of speech anal2sis of the result clause Example : ( 2 ) He left so early on Tuesday that we missed him ( 2? )  \  [4RO he JIV left'lA dyso ~\[ Advearly ~\[ pon ~ 4   uesdaY3 rs that wessed We could add some further structure to this bracketing by subsuming the adjacent adverbs under one node : ~\ [ Advso ~ lAdy  early33 We can , however , not incorporate the " that "- clause into this eyntagmatic unit  , since the prepositional phrase " on Tuesday " intervenes between both parts  . 
2 , 2~ A functional anal2sis of the result clause The ~ rucial question concerning the functional analysis of a sentence llke  ( 2 ) is : which constituent governs the " that "- clause ? In other words  , where do ~ e have to attach the S-node of the result clause ? Pot reasons  ( to be given in the full version of this paper ) we propose the following dependence structure for  ( 2 ) :  ( 2" ) 
SUJGOVMP
GOV left ~ IPGOV on Tuesdayl / ' ~- L he GO VJN ~ early so that we missed him-  97   -2  . 3 . A synthetic representation 2 . 3 . 1 . Unfortunately , the part of speech analysis and the functional analysis do not match  ( cf . the disturbance of the word order in (2") . 
A marging of the labeled bracketing with the dependency structure would give the following result :  ( II ) r  ~ , - ~\] @ Ro ~ , ~ EA , GOVJ on Tuesday ti at . . , him he ~ A , GOg\[- , MF Jearly lso The lowest MF-node dominates no lexlcal material  , and has , consequently , no category label . The righ most S-node , on the other hand , has no functional label , since it does not bear any dependency relation to the verb  . 
Important to note is the fact that both deficient nodes are complementary  , and that they in fact refer to each other . 
In order to make thls relation explicit , I propose to add an index ( an arbitrary integer ) to both nodes : ( II )   ,  . . ~-, MPJ1 . .  . ~ S , -~ iThanks to this coindexlng device we are able to merge two levels of sentence structure  , although they do not seem to be compatible at first sight  . 
2 . 3 . 2 . The computation of ( II ) can be performed in a straightforward way : .   .   . so .   .   . A,?Vso-J"JJ ''' J2 . If there is a that-clause in S ' , then give it a ~ S , - Ji-no-de , and attach it immediately under the S "- node . 
If there is no such clause , then delete the L- , MPJi-node . 

Comparison with a transformational t reatment  .

~ tA third example : deep and surface subteots ~tl ~ On the notion " surface sub  , ~ ect"3 . 2 . On the notion " deep subject "3 . 3  . A synthetic representation
In a sentence like ( 3 ) it seems that Steve likes her it could be argued that the surface subject and the deep sub-ject do not coincide  . Making use of some new notations ( to be explained in the full version of thi spaper  ) and of the device already known from section 2   . 3  . 1  . I propose the following ana-lysistree fo r  ( 3  )  :  ( III ) \[ S , - , -3 that likes her ~ PRO , GOV\]seems Steve Merging is a technique of representing different levels of syntact i c  ( and semantic ) structure in one analysis tree . 
In order to make merging work one has to make sure that :  1  . each level of analysis is properly def in ed  , i . e . 
-that there exists a list of possible va lues for the labels - that there is an algor ithm for assigning those values in each part icular case-that there is a unifying pr inciple at each level  ( for instance , the dependency principle at the level of funct-ional analysis  )  . 
2 . The relations between the different levels are properly defined  . In order to ~- , ~ rant the latter I have pleaded for- 99 -adding referenoe indices to the nodes , thus introducing a new formal device in the ~ ra~marathird dimension in the an~ysist ree  . 
Some merits of the merging technique in a progrsm  . for auto-matic translation .
