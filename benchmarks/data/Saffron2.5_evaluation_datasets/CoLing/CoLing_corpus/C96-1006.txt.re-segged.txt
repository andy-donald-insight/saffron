A new method has been developed for extracting word correspondences from a bilingual corpus  . First , the cooccurrence in fi~rmation for each word in both languages is extracted li'om the corpus  . Then , the correlations between the cooccurrence f atures of the words are calculated pairwisely with tile assistance of a basic word bilingual dictionary  . Finally , the pairs of words with the highest correlations are output selectively  . This method is applicable to rather small , unaligned corpora ; it can extract correspondences between compound words as well as simple words  . An experiment using bilingual patent -specification corpora achieved  28% recall and 76% precision ; this demonstrates that the method effectively reduces the cost of bilingual dictionary augmentation  . 
1 Introduction
Bilingual dictionaries are essential componeuts for machine translation systems  . One of the major problems with bilingual dictionaries is that they are expensive to build  , since a huge number of terms are used in a variety of fields  . Cnmputer support is thus needed to reduce the cost of dictionary building  . 
With the growing w dume of text available in electronic lorm  , a number of methods have been proposed to r extracting word correspondences from bilingual corpora automatically  . These methods can be divided into those taking a statistical approach  ( Gale & Church 1991a ; Kupiec 1993 ; Dagan et al 1993 ; Inoue & Nogaito 1993 ; Fung 1995 ) and those taking a linguistic approach ( Yamamoto & Sakamoto 1993 ; Kum~mo & Hirakawa 1994 ; Ishimoto & Nagao 1994) . The statistical approach utilizes the occurrence frequencies and locations of words in a parallel corpus to calculate the pairwise correlations between the words in the two languages  . The linguistic approach primarily extracts correspondences between compound words by consulting a bilingual dictionary of simple words  . 
These proposed methods for extracting word correspondences from bilingual corpora have the following drawbacks  . First , most of the ln assume that the input corpora m'e aligned sentence by sentence  , which reduces their applicability remarkably . Although a number of automatic sentence alignment methods have been proposed  ( Brown et al 1991 ; Gale & Church 1991b ; Kay & Roscheisen 1993 ; Chen 1993) , they are not very reliable for real noisy bilingual texts  . Second , the statistical methods usually require a very large corpus as their input  . However , it is not easy to obtain a very large corpus . Third , tile linguistic methods are restricted to extracting correspondences between compound words  . 
We have developed an extraction method that is freefi ' om the above drawbacks  . In Sec .   2 we describe the hasic idea of our methud and give an overview  . In Sec . 3 we describe the technical details , and in Sec .   4 we describe an experiment using patent -specification texts  . 
In Sec .   5 we make a remark on the effectiveness of the proposed method  , and discuss directions for improvement . 
2 Overview of Proposed Method
The finding underlying our proposed method is as follows  . In a hilingual corpus , a pair of words corresponding to each other generally accompany the same context  , although expressed in the two difl crent languages  . If we calculate the pairwise correlations between the contexts in which the words occur  , a correponding pair of words will show a high correlation  . 
Although one occurrence of a word may not give a suMcient context ochm ' acterize the word  , accumulating all the contexts in which the word occurs throughout the text allows the word to be distinguished from the other words in the same language text  . 
Figure 1 shows how two words are associated through their contexts  , each expressed in its respective language . 
We use the set of words co-nc curring with word w , which we refer to as the cooccurrences to fw , to concisely representire accumt dated contexts characterizing the word  . To associate two cooccurrence sets whose elements are words in different languages  , we consult a bilingual dictionary and extract the possible word correspondences between them  . The point is that even if the pair of words to be associated is missing in the bilingual dictionary  , their cooccurrence sets can be associated through the bilingual dictionary  . Of cource , some of the correspondences between the cooccurrence sets may be also missing in the bilingual dictionary  . 
Nevertheless , the cooccurrence sets can be still associated , owing to the other correspondences between them that arc contained in the bilingual dictionary  .

idea . While the example shown here are for Japanese and English  , the method is applicable to any pair of languages  . The method is divided into three parts : Japanese text processing  , English text processing , and bilingual processing . The Japanese text processing is composed of sentence segmentation  , morphological analysis , and cooccurrence data extraction . It extracts a cooccurrence set for each word from a Japanese text  . 
Likewise , the English text processing extracts a cooccurrences t for each word from an Engish text  . The bilingual processing then calculates the pairwise correlations between the cooccurrence sets for Japanese words and those for English words  , and selects the pairs of words with the highest correlations  . 
3 Technical Details 3 . 1 Extract ion of words from text Natural language texts are composed of two types of words : content words and function words  . The target of extraction can usually be restricted to the correspondences between content words  , which are characterized by both dominance in number and straightforwardness  . Additionally , the function words are useless as elements of cooccurrence sets  , since they do not indicate specific contexts . Therefore , we extract only the content words from the texts in both languages  . 
The content words are divided into simple words and lookup mid morphological analysis  . To extract the latter , we are describing a set of rules or patterns . So far , we have only addressed nominal compounds ( simple noun phrases )  , whose patterns arc given below . Here , N , A , and NP stand for noun , adjective , and simple noun phrase , respectively . Nq-stands for at string of one or more Ns . 
? Japanese nominal comlx mnds:NP := NN + ? English nonfinal compounds : NP := NN+IAN + The nominal compounds are extracted from the morphological analysis results by pattern matching  . 
Here , an NP included in a larger NP is rejected , since only self-contained NPs qualify as nominal compounds  . One exception is an English NP starting wilh a noun that is included in an NP starting with an adjective  , lmcause the case of an adjective modil'ying a nominal compound is just as likely as the case of an adjective being a part of an oIll in ltl CO m p cull d  ,  3 . 2 Ext ract ion of co - occur rence data Definitions of ' cooccurrence ' include syntactic cooccurrence  , cooccurrence in a k-word window , co- . occurrcuce illa sentence , and co-occnrfcnccilla documen . We use co- . occurrence in a sentence , in which a pair of words occurring within the same sentence is regarded as a cooccurrence  . While cooccurrence in a k-word window may produce better results when a sentence in one hulguage corresi  ) onds to a sequence of lwo or more shorler sentences in tile other language  , it is difficult to determine an appropriate w due of k because word order differs considerably between Japanese and 

The relations between a compound word and its constituent words are not  , strictly speaking , co-occn rreucerlations . Moreover , if we treated them in the same nlanucrits co- occurrence relations  , it would cause some confosion . Suppose that compound word w is composed of l wo simple words  , w ' and w " . If we included both w ' and w " in the cooccurrence set of w  , and vice versa , the differences between the cooccurrence set of w and those of w ' and w " woukl decrease  . Therefore , we exclude the constituent words from the cooccurrence set of a compound word and vice versa  . 
As mentioned in Section 2 , the cooccurrence sets of a word are accumulated . This is not a mere union operation , but a union operation accompanied by frequency counting  . The resultant cooccurrences t is expressed as
C(w ) = w , / f , \[ i=1 , -'- , n , which shows that word w~co-occurs with word w ( times . 
3 . 3 Calcu lat ion of corre lat ions between words We define correlation R  ( j  w , ew ) between Japanese word jw and English word e was follows  . 
R(jw , ew ) : Ic ( j  w ) ClC ( ew ) I/IC ( iw ) It-IC ( ew ) IIC ( / w ) r ) C ( ew ) I 1 . 
Here , C(jw ) = jw , / t ~ I i=1 ,  ' "  , m and C(ew ) = e%/gjIj = 1 ,  ' "  , n are the cooccurrence sets of j wandew , respectively . C(j'w)f)C(ew ) = (\] wi , ewj)/lkjli=1 ,  ' "  , m ; j=1 ,  ' "  , n is the intersection of C(jw ) and C(ew ) , whose elements ~ u'e pairs of a Japanese word and an English word with their frequency  . \]?\[ means the sum of frequencies of all elements  . 
Generating intersection C ( \] w ) f ) C ( ew ) from C ( \]w ) and C ( ew ) is not easy because the procedure of pairing jw ~ ( c_C ( \] w ) and eu ~ ( E  ~ C ( ew )   ) is nondeterministic . A pair of words cannot be determined independently of the other possible pairs  . To reduce processing time , we calculate JC(jw ) ( ) C(ew ) I approximately , as illustrated in Fig . 
3 . For example , the English-based approximate calculation is done as follows  . First , Japanese cooccurrence set C ( j  w ) is transformed in to pseudo cooccurrence set Cl , ( jw ) by consulting bilingual dictionary D , which is a set () f pairs of words :
Cp(jw ) = ewj/f'jIj=1 ,  ' "  , n , where f ' j = Z f ~ . 
m ~ CO'w ) & ( iw , , ew ? ~ D
The intersection of pseudo cooccurrence set Cp ( j  w ) and English cooccurrences tC ( ew ) is then generated : Cp ( iw )   ( 3C ( ew ) = e%/minf'j , gi \] J = 1 ,  ' "  , n . 
Finally , \] C p ( iw )   ( ) C ( ew ) \ ] is calculated as the al ) proximat cw tlue of IC ( j  w ) rlC ( ew ) I:ICp ( j  w )   ( ~ C ( ew ) I = ) 2minf ' )  , gj . 

Tiffs approximate calculation is likely to result in an overestimated correlation when there is ambiguity in pairing jw  , ((! C(/w )) and eu ~( GC(ew )) , as occurs in Fig . 3(a ) . Figure 3 ( a ) shows that the number of elements in the intersection exceeds that in the Japanese co -uccurrences t  . The English-based and Japanese-based approximate calculations therefore do not always coincide with each other  . While selecting the minimmn of the two approx in m tew ducs is safer  , it does not guarantee a precise value . Since ambiguity in associating cooccurrence sets does not occur too often  , and considering the needlbrefficiency , we execute either of the two approximate calculations rather than make a precise calculation  . 
To increase tile reliability of the correlation values  , we remove tile useless words from tile Cooccur rence sets before calculating the correlations  . The useless Japanese word is jw such that ew I  ( j ' w , ew ) c-D ( \]ewIewe-TE = ( Tu is the input English text )  , and tile useless English wordisew such that jw I  ( \] w , ew ) ~Df\]jw\[jw ~: Tj = ( Tj is the inpt , t Japanese text ) . These words do not contribute to the word pair correlations  . 
3 . 4 Se lec t ion of pa i rs o f words with h igh cor relation The absolute values of the correlations are not significant because they are sensitive to the numbers of words in the cooccurrences ts  , which vary considerably from word to word . However , their relative values are significant when either a Japanese or an English word is fixed  . We take the strategy of selecting the mutually best-matched pairs having no highly probable competitors  . We call ( jw , \[~ dJ~d ~ , probiemy Cjo ; ~\] cu ~ l:nce det of C?E Cg fi:hen Coer ; e t ? f ( a ) English-based approximate calculation ~ ( ~ l ' , issue ) : i : i : i ~ II ~ ~ t ~ ~0 ( Pall S , issue ) ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ " ~ l ~ ~- ~ ~\ [ ~ , problem ) ~' ~ " Cooccurrencest of Cooccurrences to fa Japanese word an English word  ( b ) Japanese-based approximate calculation Fig . 3 Approximate calculation of correlation .

When for a mutually best-matched pair ( jw , ew ) , there exists eitherew ' such that R(jw , ew ) > a?R(jw , ew ) and ~ w , ew ) CD or jw ' such that R(jw' , ew ) > " a"RU w , ew ) and ( jw' , ew ) < D , we call ( jw , ew ) or ( jw ' , ew ) a highly probable competitor ? Here , a is a predetermined constant (0 < a < ~1) , and D is the bilingual dictionary . 
3 . 5 Feedback of extracted pairs of words Obviously , the performance of the proposed method depends upon the coverage of the bilingual dictionary over the corpus  . The coverage is the proportion of the word correspondences in the corpus that are already contained in the bilingual dictionary  . Generally speaking , the wider the coverage , the more reliable the correlation values . Accordingly , the feedback of extracted pairs will probably improve performance  , ven though some of them are erroneous . In Fig . 2, the feedback is represented by dotted line . 
4 Experiment and Results
We implemented our proposed method on a workstation and carried out an experiment using patent-specification documents in Japanese and English and a bilingual dictionary for a machine translation system  . The dictionary contains approximately 60 , 000 Japanese entry words , each having several English translations . 
The quantitative profile of the sample patent documents is shown in Table l  ( a )  . 
We executed the word correspondence extraction program for each document  . Parameter a in the selection of pairs of words was assumed to be  0  . This means that tile output pairs were limited as much as possible  . Both results before and after feedback were obtained to evaluate the effect of feedback  . The extracted pairs of words were divided into two groups : those which are already contained in the bilingual dictionary and those which are not yet contained in the bilingual dictionary J  ) The former are insignificant from the practical point of view  . However , they are signficant in evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed correlation measure because the dictionary information regarding a particular pair of words does not contribute to the correlation between the pak itself  . Accordingly , we evaluated two cases : Case A-the already known pairs of words are included - and Case B- the already known pairs of words are excluded  . 
A good way to evaluate word correspondence extraction methods is to measure their recall and precision  . These measures are defined as follows . The recall is the proportion of all word correspondences in alJ We neglected tile reference number speculiar to the patent docmnents because their correpondences are Irivial  .

The precision is the proportion of extracted word correspondences that arc actually correct  . While the precision is rather easy to calculate , the recall is difficult to calculate because it is a time-consuming task to manually identify all the word correspondences in the bilingual cortms  . Therefore , instead of calculating the recall according to its de_nition  , we make a rough estimation using the ratio of the number of correct pairs of words extracted to the number of words in either the Japanese or English text  . We call this the pseudo-recall . 
The pseudo-recall indicates the lowest limit of the recall since a word in the Japanese text does not always have a straightforward counterpart in the English text  , and vice versa .

The experiment confirmed that the proposed method can extract not only compound word correspondences but also simple word correspondences from a small corpus  . 
Examples of word correspondences x tracted from a patent document are shown in Table  2  . The comparison of results before and after feedback supported the effectiveness of using feedback  . That is , feedback increases recall while preserving precision  . We also ascertained that repeating the feedback one more time did not result in significant improvement  . 
5 Discussion
The experiment shows that the proposed method is effective in reducing the cost of bilingual dictionary augmentation  . Tile recall of the method is not high . 
Furthermore , it cannot extract more than one correspondence for a word  . Still , the method is effective because it can extract from a small corpus  . Bilingual documen L should be handled separately . Even if a correspondence pair of words fails to be extracted from one bilingual document  , it may be extracted from another bilingual document  , where it occurs prevailingly . 
The following are directions for further improvement  . 
(1 ) Refinement of nominal compound extraction procedure : The simplified procedure described in Sec  .  3 . 1 often causes omission ( a nominal compound is not extracted ) and noise ( an inappropriate word string is extracted )  . 
These are major causes of errors in word correspondence extraction  ; refining the nominal compound extraction procedure will considerably improve recall and precision  . 
(2 ) Use of symbol/numeral correspondences : In the present implementation  , the correspondences of symbols and numerals are not used in calculating the correlation because the bilingual dictionary does not contain them  . However , they have the potential of increasing the reliablilty of the correlation values  . A character-string-matching routine to identify the correspondences of symbols/numerals should thus be added to the correlation calculation module  . 
(3 ) Use of the constituent word information of compound words : The key idea of our method is to associate a pair of words through their cooccurrence information with the assistance of a bilingual dictionary  . In contrast , that of the previous linguistic methods is to associate a pair of compound words through their constituent word information with the assistance of a bilingual dictionary  . These two are not incompatible . Combining them would surely increase the recall and precision for compound word correspondences  . 
6 Conclusion
We have developed a new method for extracting word correspondences from bilingual corpora  . The essence of the method is to calculate correlations between words based on their cooccurrence information with the assistance of a basic word bilingual dictionary  . This method is applicable to rather small , unaligned corpora ; it can extract correspondences between ot only simple words but also between compound words  . In an experiment with patent corpora , 28 . 0% pseudo-recall and 75 . 6% precision were achieved .
