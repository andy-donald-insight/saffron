Erhard Hinrichs Universtiy of T?bingen Department of Linguistics erhard.hinrichs@uni-tuebingen.de Abstract It has been recognized for quite some time that sustainable data formats play an important role in the development and curation of linguistic resources . The purpose of this paper is to show how GermaNet , the German version of the Princeton WordNet , can be converted to the Lexical Markup Framework ( LMF ), a published ISO standard ( ISO24613) for encoding lexical resources . The conversion builds on Wordnet-LMF , which has been proposed in the context of the EU KYOTO project as an LMF format for wordnets . The present paper proposes a number of crucial modifications and a set of extensions to Wordnet-LMF that are needed for conversion of wordnets in general and for conversion of GermaNet in particular . 1 Introduction It has been recognized for quite some time that sustainable data formats play an important role in the development and curation of linguistic resources . As witnessed by the success of the guidelines of the Text Encoding Initiative 1 ( TEI ) and of published standards issued by the International Standards Organization 2 ( ISO ), markup languages such as XML3 ( short for : Extensible Markup Language ) have become lingua francas for encoding linguistic resources of different types , including phonetic transcrip - 1 See http://www.tei-c.org 2 See http://www.iso.org 3 See http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml / tions , ( annotated ) text corpora , and dictionaries . It is fair to say that it has become common practice among developers of new linguistic resources to consult TEI guidelines and ISO standards in order to develop standard-conformant encoding schemes that serve as an interchange format and that can be documented and validated by Document Type Definitions ( DTD ) and XML schemata . However , for resources that were developed prior to or largely in parallel with the emerging acceptance of markup languages and of emerging encoding standards , the situation is far more heterogeneous . A wide variety of legacy formats exists , many of which have persisted due to existing user communities and the availability of tools that can process only such idiosyncratic formats . The development of wordnets for a large number of languages is a typical example of a type of linguistic resource , where legacy formats still persist as a de facto standard . WordNet 1.6 is encoded in the data format of lexicographer files4 that was designed for the English Princeton WordNet ( Fellbaum , 1998). It is a plaintext format for storing wordnet data and allows lexicographers to encode lexical and conceptual relations among lexical units and synsets by use of spe-cial-purpose diacritics . There exist numerous tools that can process WordNet 1.6 lexicographer files to extract relevant information or to transform the data into other special-purpose formats such as Prolog-fact databases . Even tough still widely used for the reasons just mentioned , the complexity of the format itself has a number of undesirable consequences . As Henrich and Hinrichs (2010) have pointed out , 4 See http://wordnet.princeton.edu/man/lexnames.5 WN.html 5 See http://www.sfs.uni-tuebingen.de/GermaNet / 6 See http://www.lexicalmarkupframework.org 7 An anonymous reviewer raised the question why OWL is not a good candidate for encoding wordnets . On this issue , we agree with the assessment of Soria et al (2009) who point out that ?[?] RDF and OWL are conceptual repositories representation formats that are not designed to represent polysemy and store linguistic properties of words and word meanings .? wordnets for a steadily increasing number of languages . 3. To show how these open issues can be resolved in a customized version of Wordnet-LMF suitable for GermaNet . The remainder of this paper is structured as follows : section 2 provides a general introduction to GermaNet . Details about the adapted XML format used for GermaNet up until now are provided in section 3. Section 4 introduces the challenge of how to represent a wordnet in the Lexical Markup Framework . As one possibility , Wordnet-LMF is regarded . Issues that arise during the conversion of GermaNet into Wordnet-LMF lead to a modified version of Wordnet-LMF . Finally , section 5 concludes with a comparison of the two representation formats . 2 GermaNet GermaNet is a lexical semantic network that is modeled after the Princeton WordNet for English . It partitions the lexical space into a set of concepts that are interlinked by semantic relations . A semantic concept is modeled by a synset . A synset is a set of words ( called lexical units ) where all the words are taken to have ( almost ) the same meaning . Thus a synset is a set-representation of the semantic relation of synonymy , which means that it consists of a list of lexical units and a paraphrase ( represented as a string ). The lexical units in turn have frames ( which specify the syntactic valence of the lexical unit ) and examples . The list of lexical units for a synset is never empty , but any of the other properties may be . There are two types of semantic relations in GermaNet : conceptual and lexical relations . Conceptual relations hold between two semantic concepts , i.e . synsets . They include relations such as hyperonymy , part-whole relations , entailment , or causation . Lexical relations hold between two individual lexical units . Antonymy , a pair of opposites , is an example of a lexical relation . GermaNet covers the three word categories of adjectives , nouns , and verbs , each of which is hierarchically structured in terms of the hyperonymy relation of synsets.
457 Figure 1. Structure of the XML synset files . 3 Current GermaNet XML Format The structure of the XML files closely follows the internal structure of GermaNet , which means that the file structure mirrors the underlying relational organization of the data . There are two DTDs that jointly describe the XML-encoded GermaNet . One DTD represents all synsets with their lexical units and their attributes ( see subsection 3.1). The other DTD represents all relations , both conceptual and lexical relations ( see subsection 3.2). The GermaNet XML format was initially developed by Kunze and Lemnitzer (2002), but modifications of the GermaNet data itself led to an adopted XML format , which is presented here.8 3.1 XML Synset Files The XML files that represent all synsets and lexical units of GermaNet are organized around the three word categories currently included in GermaNet : nouns , adjectives , and verbs ( altogether 54 synset files since the semantic space for each word category is divided into a number of semantic subfields ). The structure of each of these files is illustrated in Figure 19. Each synset represents a set of lexical units ( lexUnits ) which all express the same meaning . This grouping represents the 8 The interested reader might compare the version at hand with ( Lemnitzer and Kunze , 2002) or ( Kunze and Lemnitzer , 2002), which both describe the initial GermaNet XML version . 9 In fact , this figure is not quite complete for the reason of simplicity.
semantic relation of synonymy . Further properties of a synset ( e.g ., the word category or a describing paraphrase ) and a lexical unit ( e.g ., a sense number or the orthographical form ( orthForm )) are encoded appropriately . Figure 1 describes the underlying XML structure . Each box in the figure stands for an element in the XML files , and the properties in each box ( listed underneath the wavy line ) represent the attributes of an XML element . This means , for example , that a synset element has the attributes of an id and a category.10 Figure 2 shows an example of a synset with two lexical units ( lexUnit elements ) and a paraphrase . The lexUnit elements in turn contain several attributes and an orthographical form ( the orthForm element ), e.g ., leuchten ( German verb for : to shine ). The first of the two lexical units even has a frame and an example . < synset id="s58377" category="verben "> < lexUnit id="l82207" sense="1" namedEntity="no " artificial="no " styleMarking="no "> < orthForm>leuchten</orthForm > < frame>NN</frame > < example > < text > Der Mond leuchtete in der Nacht . </ text > < exframe>NN</exframe > </ example > </ lexUnit > < lexUnit id="l82208" 10 Note that XML element or attribute names appear italic if they are referenced in the text.

Synset file example . 3.2 XML Relation File This type of XML file represents both kinds of relations : conceptual and lexical relations . All relations are encoded within one XML file , whose structure is illustrated in Figure 3.
Figure 3. Structure of the XML relation file . The boxes in Figure 3 again represent XML elements , which means that there is one relations element that contains all lexical relations ( lex_rel elements ) and conceptual relations ( con_rel elements ). Both relation types contain several attributes . Figure 4 illustrates an example for each of the two relation types . The type of the conceptual relation is hyperonymy ( indicated by the name attribute ), and it holds between the synset with ID s58377 ( from attribute ) and the synset with ID s58376 ( to attribute ). The lexical relation is of type antonymy ( again indicated by the name attribute ), and holds between the lexical units with the IDs l2471 ( from attribute ) and l12470 ( to attribute).

Example from relation file . 4 Wordnet-LMF The Lexical Markup Framework ( ISO24613) is an ISO standard for encoding natural language processing lexicons and machine readable dictionaries ( Francopoulo et al , 2006). The intention of LMF is to provide a common model for the creation and use of lexical resources , to manage the exchange of data between and among these resources , and to enable the merging of a large number of individual electronic resources to form extensive global electronic resources . 4.1 The Challenge The core structure of LMF is based on the prototypical structuring of a lexicon in terms of lexical entries , each of which enumerates the different senses of the lexical item in question . This word-driven perspective contrasts the synset-driven relational structure of wordnets ? the grouping of word senses ( i.e ., lexical units ) that express the same meaning into synsets . Exactly these two radically different organizing principles ( relation-based in the case of wordnets versus lexical-entry-based in the case of LMF ) constitute the challenge of encoding wordnets in LMF . We take up this challenge : How can a synset-based wordnet , e.g . GermaNet , be represented in a word-driven format like LMF ? 4.2 Apply LMF to Wordnets The conversion of GermaNet to LMF will build on Wordnet-LMF ( Soria et al , 2009; Lee et al , 2009), an existing Lexical Markup Framework subset11. Wordnet-LMF has been developed in the context of the EU KYOTO 11 Wordnet-LMF is a proper subset of LMF since there are specifications in LMF that are not in Wordnet-LMF and since there is nothing in Wordnet-LMF which is not in LMF . Soria et al (2009) themselves refer to Wordnet-LMF as an LMF dialect.
459 Figure 5. The Wordnet-LMF structure . project12 and is especially tailored to encode wordnets in the LMF standard . Wordnet-LMF is specified by a Document Type Definition ( see Appendix E in ( Soria and Monachini , 2008)) and fully complies with standard LMF . The Wordnet-LMF XML structure is shown in Figure 513 . There is a Lexical Resource which contains at least one Lexicon ( in this case a wordnet lexicon).14 A Lexical Entry represents a word entry in a Lexicon , where the word itself is represented by the writtenForm attribute of the Lemma element . Lexical Entries group different Senses of a particular word . The Senses have a synset attribute that relates them to a Synset element by the corresponding ID . If two Senses have the same synset attribute , they belong to the same Synset and are thus synonyms . A Synset can have several relations to other Synsets . These relations are encoded in SynsetRelation elements . 12 See http://www.kyoto-project.eu 13 Note that this figure does not show the whole Wordnet-LMF model . Only the monolingual part that is relevant for this paper is represented . The representation of multilingual resources ( i.e ., the optional SenseAxis element with its children ) is not considered in this paper . For a complete picture , see Soria et Monachini (2008). 14 Here , XML element or attribute names again appear italic if they are referenced in the text.
4.3 Apply Wordnet-LMF to GermaNet The differences between the synset-driven structure of GermaNet ( see Figures 1 and 3) and the word-driven format of Wordnet-LMF ( see Figure 5) are obvious . But there is also a strong commonality : Both formats have synset elements that cluster synonymous words . In GermaNet , the words are represented by lexical units that are child elements of a synset . In Wordnet-LMF , senses , which correspond to the lexical units in GermaNet , are linked to a synset ( by an attribute containing a synset ID ). The conversion of GermaNet to Wordnet-LMF proceeds as follows : Each lexical unit of GermaNet is turned into a Sense element in Wordnet-LMF ( see Figure 5). The synset attribute ( containing a Synset ID ) of the Sense element links this Sense with the Synset that it is a member of . The different Sense elements are grouped by their orthographical form ( the Lemma in Wordnet-LMF ) into Lexical Entries . An example of a GermaNet LexicalEntry in Wordnet-LMF is shown in Figure 6. This LexicalEntry represents the word leuchten ( German verb for : to shine ), as the writtenForm attribute of the Lemma element indicates . This LexicalEntry has two Senses , which belong to different Synsets ( see the different synset attributes of the Sense elements).
460
Each Sense has a MonolingualExternalRefs element with at least one MonolingualExternalRef representing a reference to an external system . In this case , each Sense is linked to the corresponding entry in the GermaNet database 15 ; the externalReference attribute of a MonolingualExternalRef specifies the database table name with a database ID . < LexicalEntry id="deu-52-l4601-v "> < Lemma writtenForm="leuchten " partOfSpeech="v " /> < Sense id="deu-52-l4601-v_1" synset="deu-52-s58377-v "> < MonolingualExternalRefs > < MonolingualExternalRef externalSystem="GermaNet-Database " externalReference = " lex_uni_table#id=82207" /> </ MonolingualExternalRefs > </ Sense > < Sense id="deu-52-l4601-v_2" synset="deu-52-s58718-v "> < MonolingualExternalRefs > < MonolingualExternalRef externalSystem="GermaNet-Database " externalReference = " lex_uni_table#id=82677" /> </ MonolingualExternalRefs > </ Sense > </ LexicalEntry > Figure 6. Example of a LexicalEntry . In the next conversion step , all synsets of GermaNet are listed with their relations to other synsets . The corresponding Synset ( with the ID deu-52-s58377-v ) of the first Sense in Figure 6 is illustrated in Figure 7. It has , inter alia , a describing gloss and two example sentences . The element SynsetRelations encodes relations to other Synset instances . The relations are simply encoded with a target attribute that contains the ID of the referencing Synset . The Synsets in Wordnet-LMF are logically the ? same ? as the synsets in GermaNet XML , i.e . the concept that a synset expresses is exactly the same in both formats . Each Synset has a reference to the GermaNet database . Therefore , the MonolingualExternalRef element links to the corresponding entry in the GermaNet database ; the 15 For efficency reasons , GermaNet is stored in a relational database.
externalReference attribute specifies the database table name with the synsets database ID . < Synset id="deu-52-s58377-v " baseConcept="1"> < Definition gloss="Lichtstrahlen aussenden , gro?e Helligkeit verbreiten "> < Statement example="Der Mond leuchtete in der Nacht ."/> < Statement example="Die Lichter der Stadt strahlen in die Nacht ."/> </ Definition > < SynsetRelations > < SynsetRelation target="deu-52-s58376-v " relType="has_hyperonym "/> </ SynsetRelations > < MonolingualExternalRefs > < MonolingualExternalRef externalSystem="GermaNet-Database " externalReference = " synset_table#id=58377"/> </ MonolingualExternalRefs > </ Synset > Figure 7. Example of a Synset . These two Figures 6 and 7 represent the same example in Wordnet-LMF that was already shown in the GermaNet XML format in Figure 1. 4.4 Necessary Modifications to Wordnet-LMF As the previous discussion has shown , Word-net-LMF provides a very useful basis for converting GermaNet into LMF . However , a number of modifications to Wordnet-LMF are needed if this conversion is to preserve all information present in the original resource . The present section will discuss a number of modifications to Wordnet-LMF that are needed for conversion of wordnets in general . In addition , we will also discuss a set of extensions to Wordnet-LMF that are needed for conversion of GermaNet in particular . The most glaring omission in Wordnet-LMF concerns the modeling of lexical relations which hold between lexical units ( i.e ., Senses in the terminology of Wordnet-LMF ). In the current Wordnet-LMF DTD only conceptual relations ( i.e ., SynsetRelations in the terminology of Wordnet-LMF ), which hold between synsets , are modeled . Thus antonymy , which is a typical example of a lexical relation ( see ( Fellbaum , 1998) for further details ), can cur - 16 Piek Vossen ( personal communication ) has pointed out to us that Wordnet-LMF does not impose a list of relations as a standard yet . 17 In WordNet , frames are encoded in a controlled language using paraphrases such as Somebody ---- s something for a transitive verb with an animate subject and an inanimate object . The frames in GermaNet use complementation codes provided with the German version of the CELEX Lexical Database ( Baayen et al , 2005) such as NN.AN for transitive verbs with accusative objects.
with lexical units18. GermaNet correlates examples additionally with particular syntactic frames and treats both examples and syntactic frames as properties of lexical units , i.e . Senses in the terminology of Wordnet-LMF . The above issues lead to a modified version of the Wordnet-LMF DTD as shown in Figure 8. Compared to Figure 5, the Sense element is enriched by three optional subelements : SenseRelations , SenseExamples , and SubcategorizationFrames . It has to be noted , though , that LMF proper contains all necessary elements . The three notions SenseRelation , SenseExample , and SubcategorizationFrame come from LMF proper and these elements can be used to remedy the omissions in Wordnet-LMF . The SenseRelation element in Figure 8 represents relations between different Senses ( the lexical units in GermaNet ). The SenseExamples and SubcategorizationFrames elements both group several SenseExample or SubcategorizationFrame instances . A SubcategorizationFrame element represents the syntactic valence of a word sense . A SenseExample shows the prototypical usage of a word sense as an example sentence . The syntactic valence for a concrete example sentence can be specified with the optional frame attribute of a SenseExample . 5 Conclusion : Comparing GermaNet XML with Wordnet-LMF XML We would like to conclude with a comparison between the GermaNet native XML format described in section 3 and the modified Word-net-LMF format described in section 4.4. Since the GermaNet native XML format was particularly tailored to the structure of GermaNet , it enjoys the usual advantages of such customized solutions : it contains all and only the necessary XML elements and attributes to describe the resource . Moreover , the data are distributed over 55 different XML files , which facilitates easy data handling and efficient search by word classes and lexical fields . These properties are in fact exploited by a number of GermaNet-specific tools , including 18 In WordNet , the examples are placed at the synset level , but referencing to a word sense at the same time.
462 Figure 8. Revised Wordnet-LMF structure . a GermaNet-Explorer , a tool for data exploration and retrieval , and a GermaNet Pathfinder , a tool for the calculation of semantic relatedness , similarity , and distance ( Cramer and Finthammer , 2008). All of these tools utilize the Java API that has been developed for the GermaNet native XML format . At the same time the GermaNet native XML format is a proprietary data format that was developed at a time when the only de facto encoding standard for wordnets consisted of the lexicographer files , originally developed for the Princeton WordNet . As such GermaNet XML was never developed with the goal of providing an XML standard for modeling wordnets in general . With Wordnet-LMF a candidate standard has now been proposed that is compliant with the LMF ISO standard for lexical resources and that strives to provide a general encoding standard of wordnets for different languages . As the discussion in section 4.4 has shown , the current Wordnet-LMF DTD still needs to be amended to account for the full range of wordnet relations , frames , and examples ( see Figure 8). These elements are not in Wordnet-LMF because Wordnet-LMF is a subset , but these elements are defined in the ISO document 24613 where LMF proper is defined . However , Wordnet-LMF appears to be suitably mature to serve as an interchange format for wordnets of different languages as well as for linking wordnets of different languages with one another19.
