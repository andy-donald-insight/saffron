Abstract
In this paper , we describe the creation of rules for generating Chinese zero anaphors through a sequence of experiments in a stepwise enhanced manner  . In the experiments , we basically examined the occurrence of zero anaphors in a real text and the ones generated by the algorithms employing the rules  , assuming the same semantic and discourse structures as the text  . The factors of locality , syntactic constraints , discourse structure and salience of objects were considered in the rules  . The results of the experiment show that 93% of the zero anaphors in the text can be correctly generated by an algorithm using a rule involving all the above factors  . 
1 Introduction
Anaphoric expressions in Chinese can be classified as zero  , pronominal and nominal forms , as exemplified in (1) by ? ~ , ta I(tie ) and nageren I ( that person ) , respectively .

In their paper ILl and Thompson 79\] , Li and Thompson have shown that zero anaphors in Chinese can occur in any grammatical slot with an antecedent that may occur in any grammaticals ot  , regardless of * Also with the Department of Information Engineering at Tatung Institute of Technology  , Taipei , Taiwan .

the distance between them . Although there is no clear rule to account for zero anaphora  , nevertheless , as pointed out by Li and Thompson , zero anaphora com-in only occur in the situation of a " topic chain  , " where a referent is referred to in the first clause  , and then several more clauses follow talking about the same refer-cut but with it omitted  . In\[Chen87\] , Chen proposed the notion of " contimfity " of referent in discourse to give a more specific account of zero auaphora  . 
In this paper , we aim at deciding when to generate z croanaphors from some internal semantics true turc  . 
Although there are no clear rules stated in previous linguistic work  , we , nevertheless , cau summarize a very simple rule , R . ule1 as shown below , for the generation of zero anaphors . 
Rule 1: if an entity , c , in the current utterance was referred to in the immediately preceding utterance  , then a zero anaplior is used for c ; otherwise a nonzero anaphor is used . 
We , performed at \] experiment by comparing the zero anaphors generated by the algorithm employing this rule and those occurring in real text to see how well it works  . The initial result showed that zero anaphors were overgenerated to a large extent in the text produced by employing Rulel  . Consequently , we considered other wellknown factors namely , syntactic constraints \[ Li and Thompson81\] , discourse structure \[ Grosz and Sidner 86\] and the salience of objecl , s in utteranees \[ Sidner 83\] , to get better results . 
2 Experiment
A number of articles written by different authors were selected as the linguistic sources with which the text produced by employing the generat  , i on algorithms can be compared . For the moment , the selected articles are restricted to the exposition type  , namely , ones which explain an idea or discuss a problem . Two sets of data were selected ; one consists of an unlber of scien-tiff ( : questions and answers for children and the ol ~ her is a brief introduction to modern Chinese grammar  . 
Basically the experiment was executed in three steps  . 
First , zero anaphors within the selected articles were identiffed  . Second , h ) reach paragraph in the selected recorded the occurrence of zero anaphors that wouhl be obtained by applying the algorithm using a rule  , like Rule1 . Third , we noted down the dilfcrenees between the results of stel  ) s1nnd2 . 
In step 3 , we categorized the differences betwee a the results ms : correct  , fitlse and missiug types . If a refer-enee created by the algorithm is the same a stile one in the real text  , then it belongs to the correct type . 
If a zero an at > hor is created by the algorithm , while the corresponding position in the real text is nonzero an nphol '  , then it belongs to the false type . Conversely , if a zeronnaphor is found in some position in the real text  , while a nonzero anaphor is created by the algo = rithm  , then it t > elongs to the missiT ~ gtype . The task of step 3 is to e on nt there , tuber of cases in each type .

Intire data ,   7 and 1 long distaace zero anaphors occur but the algorithm decides to use nonzerooues for the corresponding positions  . () on sequently , they belong to the missing tyl > e . Frnm the result shown in Table 1 , the performance of the algorithm is olwiously unpromising  . 
There are certain syntactic coustrail H ; so il zero anaphorn , regardless of discourse factors , as shown in \[ Li and Thoml ) SOn 79 , Li and '\[' homps on 81\] ,  . Therefore , we enhanced R , uh : 1 by adding the above syntactic constraints on zero an nphora  , which I ) ecomes l ( , ulcIn as below . Rulela can be alternntively I > e represented as a decision tree iu Fig  .  1 , where internal nodes are conditions in the rule and leaf nodes are decisions about the anaphor type  , either zero or nonzero .

To perform the experiments for the new rules , w c have to access the discourse segment structures of the testing data  . Therefore , we annotated the boundaries between discourse segments in the testing data and the hierarchical discourse structures according to the discourse segment intentions  . We farther carried out a test by comparing our annotations with other native speakers of Chinese  . In the test , four native speakers of Chinese were asked to do the same tasks we have done for five articles selected from the testing data  . 
Comparing with the speakers ' results , on average 76% of the speakers ' annotations coincide with ours . According to the a hove comparison the annotations we made were reliable for the purpose of the experiment  . 
We then performed the experiment by employing the algorithm of Rule  2  . As shown in Table 2, for the . 
Set1 data ,   49 and 12 zero anaphors were over-a IM under-generated by the algorithm  , respectively . For the other set of testing data , Rule 2 achieves an even better result .

IsetA ! g'\[~~$2R23 . 3 The effect of topic In this snb section , we use the feature of topic in Chinese to further refine the i  ) revious rifles . The basic idea here is to investigate the positions of antecedent and anaphor in their respective utterances  . In the following , we divided the position of an apbors in their respective utterances into topic and non-topic  . For each anaphor , its antecedent's position is one of the following categories : topic  , direct object or the NP following a presentative verb and others  . We thus classify the following types , A to F , of antecedent-anaphor pairs : the antecedents of Types A and C are ill topic position  , of B and D are indirect object position or are the NP following a presentative verb  , and of E and F are in other positions ; the anaphors of Types A , B and Earc in topic position , and of C , D and F are in non-topic positions . 
Since in the new rule conditions on topic and non -topic will only be considered after the conditions in Rnle  2  , in investigating the anteced cnt-anaphor pairs , we have to exclude the ones with either their anaphors violating syntactic constraints on zero anaphor or at the beginning of discourse segments  . In other words , the new condition will be attached under the Z -node in the decision tree of Fig  .  2 . In the Set1 test , lag data , there are 239 such pairs , among which anaphors of 49 pairs are zeroed by the algorithm of Rule 2 but appear in nonzero forms in the text . In other words , the 49 anaphors were overgenerated by on ralgor it bm , which in our terms belong to the false type ; the other 190 cases belong to the correct type . The number of each type of pairs for both correct and overgenerated cases in the testing data are shown in Table  3  .

Thus , if we let anaphors of Types A and B be zero and Types C and E nonzero  , then there will be 29 ( 15+14 ) overgenerated zero anaphors and 5 ( l-t-4 ) under-generated ones for the Set1 testing data . 
The numhers for TypesD and F do not conclusively supporte it berusir  , gzero or nonzero in this case . In Chen's study\[Chen87\] , he fonnd a higher percentage of zero anaphors occurring in the topic position with their antecedent most frequently in the topic or object positions of the immediately previous utterance  , which strongly supports the idea of letting anaphors of Types Aarm B bezero and others nonzero  . We choose to generate nonzero anaphora for Types D and F  . ~? W ; thus obtain Rule 3 by adding the . affect of topic into Rule 2 . 3' he decision tree for Rule3 is shown in Fig .

As a short summary , the numbers of anaphors in the Set 1 testing data satisfying the conditions of 1Lule   3 are shown in Fig . 4, where . Z , N and 1' represent zero , pronominal and nominal anaphors , respectively . 
Indicated in the root node are the total number of all kinds of anaphors in the data  . The corr'ect match is calculated by summing up the numbers of non:zero anaphors  , pronouns and nominal anaphors , under nonzero leaf nodes and zero anaphors under zero leaf nodes  . Nonzero anaphors under zero leaf nodes are the false matches  . Conversely , zero anaphors under nonzero leaf nodes arc the missing matches  . 
4 Future Work
In this paper , we focus on distinguishing zero and nonzero anaphors  . To have a full account for anaphors in Chinese , two tasks remain to be done . The first is to distinguish pronouns and nominal anaphors for tile nonzero cases  , namely , to fm'ther add conditions under the nonzero nodes in the decision tree of Fig  . 
3 . ' l ' he second tmsk is to develop an algorithm\[' or the decision of an appropriate form for nominal amtphors\[Dale  92  , Reiter and l ) ale 92\] . Afterwards , ael , these NL generation system will be develol ~ eded to test  ; th(:performance of the algorithms .
