1 Introduction
Accurate analysis of the temporal expression is crucial t br text processing a plflication such as information extraction and for chunking for efficient syntactic analysis  . In information extraction , a user might want to get a piece of information about an event  . 
Typically , the event is related with ( late or time , , which is represented by temporal expression . 
Chunking is help flfl for efficient syntactic analysis by removing irrelevant intermediate constituents generated through parsing  . It involves the task to divide sentences into non -overlatli  ) ing segments . As a result of chunking , parsing would be a problem of analysis inside chunks and between chunks  ( Yoon , et al . , 1999) . Chunking prevents the parser fl ' omproducing intermediate structures irrelevant oa final output  , which makes the parser etticient without losing accuracy  . Thus , it turns out that chunking is an essential stage t br the application system like MT that should pursue both efficiency and precision  . 
Korean , an agglutinative language , has well-developed flmctional words such as postposition and ending by which the grammatical fimction of a phrase is decisively determined  . Besides , because it is a head final language and so the head always follows its complement  , the chunking is relatively easy . However , we are also faced with an mn biguity problem in chunking  , which is often due to the temporal expression . This is because in any temporal nouns are used as the modifier of noun and vert  ) in a sentence .

Ill the examples , each temporal expression plays a syntactically different role used as noun phrase or adverbial phrase  ( The undeJ'lined is a phrase ) although they comprise the same phrasal for nls . Tile temporal expressions in la and 2a of the example serve a stile temporal adverb to modify predicates  . 
On the other hand , the temporal expressions iul band 2b are used as the modifier of other nouns . That is , as a temporal noun either contributes to construction of a noun compound or modifies a predicate  , it ; causes a structural aml ) iguity . 
One so hltion might be that the POS tagger assigns a different a g to each temporal noun e  . g . NN ll Olll S . ~ l , relexically ( lecided , it does not seem that their synta('t ; ict a . gs could tieac ( : urately t ) redi ( : ted with a relatively small size of PeG tagged ( : or l ) uS .

3 Acquiring Cooccurrence of
Temporal Expression 3 . 1 Categorizing Temporal Nouns Since many words have in common a similar meaning and flmction  , they can be categorized by their features . So do temporal nouns . That is , we say that ' Sunday ' and ' Monday ' have the same features and so would take the similar behavior pattern such as cooccurring with the similar words in a sentence or phrase  . Hence , in the frst place we categorize temporal nouns according to their meaning and function  . We first select 259 temporal nouns and divide them into 26 classes as shown in Table 1  . Among them , some temporal words have syntactic duality and others play one syntactic role  . Thus , the disambiguation process would be applied only to the words with dual syntactic functions  . 
3 . 2 Acquisition of Temporal Expressions f rom Corpus Temporal words would be combined with each other in order to be made reference to time  , which is called temporal expression . Since atem t ) oral expression is typically composed of one or a fewtem t  ) oral words , it seems to be possible to describe a grammar of modifying noun jeonlsilll-e Ulln lasisseoss da  ( hmch/NOM )   ( was delicious ) one ul ( today )  ~ @  .   .   .   .   . @ ~" X hagayo-c ( lo school ) gass da ( wenl ) modifying predicate Figure 2: Syntactic flmction alain biguity of tcnlpo-ral expression the temporal expression with a simple model like finite automata  . Illtile practical system , however , we are confronted with a complicated problen lin treating teml  ) oral expressions since many temporal words have a functional ambiguity used as both a nominal and predicate modifier  . For instance , a temporal noun one ul ( today ) could play a different role in the similar situation as shown in Figure  2  . In the first and the second path , the words to follow one ulare all noun , but the roles ( dependency rela ; ions ) of oncul are different . 
Accurate classitication of their syntactic flmctions is crucial for the application system since great difference would be made according to accuracy of the dependency result  . Practically , we therefore should take into consideration the structural ambiguity resolution as well as their representation itself in identi-modifier  1 ol ( l ; his ) , jinan ( lasl ;) ,   .   .   . gemt ) or al1 ) refixes llll \] ) er 23-10ll Hlllbel " .  ?  .

Although the syntactic function of a temporal expression would be nondeterministically selected fl ' om the context  , temporal expressions and the lexical data of local context can be represented in a deterministic way due to their finite length  . For the deterministic FST , we define the partial functions ? and ? where q ? a = q'iffd  ( q , a ) = q ' and q , a = w'iff?q'EQ such that q?a=q ' and 5(q , a , q ') = w'(R . oche and Schabes , 1995) . Then , a nubsequential FST is a eight-tui)le ( El , E2 , Q , i , F ,  ? ,  * , p ) where : E1 , E2 , Q , i and F are the smnc as the FST ; ? is the deterministic state transition fime tion that maps  ( ) x E1 on Q ; ? is the deterministic emission fimction

4.2 Clmnking
After the FST of temporal exires siolls adds to words syntactic tags such as TN and TA  , chunking is : on-ducted with results tiomout l ) uts 1 ) y the Fsr \]' . As we said earlier , : lmnking in Kore . an is relatively easy only if the temloral extression would l  ) esuc:e . ss-flt lly recognized . Actually , our clmnker is also 1) ased on the finite , state lnachine . The tbllowing is an example tbr chunking rule . s .

From the result in the table we see that the method is very effec-t  , ive in that it very accurately identifies all tile temporal expressions aim assigns them syntactic tags  . 
And , Table 2 shows the reduction resulted from chunking after temporal expression identification  . 
We take into consideration the average numl ) cr of head candidates for each word since our parser is dependency based one  . The test was conducted on the tirst file ( about 800 sentences ) of KAIST treebank ( Choictal .  , 1994) . The number was reduced by 51% in candidates compared to the system with no chunking  , wh Ml makes pa . rsing efficient . 
Most of errors were caused by tile case where tein -poral words have different syntactic roles under the same context  . In this case , the global context such as the whole sentence or int cr scnt  ; cntial infornlation or sometimes very so i ) histicated processing ix needed to resolve the prol ) lem , l ~ brinstance , '82 ~ tycoTt ( year ) h , yco'njac-yi(now/Gl;N )' could be used two- . way . If the speech time is the year 1982 , then h , yeou(fl , e-yi are conlbined with 82 nycontore present time . Otherwise , 82 does not in o(til ~ y hycordac-yi , wl fich cannot be recognized only with the local context  . Nevertheless , the system is promising in that generally it can iln provee\[flciency without losing accuracy which is crucial for the pracl  ; ical system . 
6 Conclusions hit his paper , we presented a method for identification of temporale xi  ) ressions and their syntactic functions based on FST aim lexical data extracted fl : om corpus  . Since tenlporal words have the syntactic ambiguity when used in a sentence  , it ; is impo>tant to identify the syntactic functiol las well as the temporal expression itself  . 
For the purpose , we manually extracted lexical c ( > occurrences t?om large corpus aim it was possible as the number of temporal nouns is tractable nough to manipulate lexical data t  ) y h and . As shown in tile result , lexical cooccurrences are crucial for dis -mnbiguating the syntactic flmction of the tenlporal expression  . Besides , the finite state approach pro-vide ( laneftieient model for temporal expression processing  . Combined with the clmn ker , it helped re-nmr kably lessen , by 1) runing irrelew mt candidates , intermediate structures generated while parsing .
