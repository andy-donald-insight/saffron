In this paper an architecture and an implementation for a linguistically based prosodic analyser is presented  . The implementation is designed to handle typical prosodic input in the form of parallel input channels  , and processes each input channel independently in a data-directed  , phonologically motivated configuration of partly parallel  , partly cascaded feature modules and module clusters  , each implemented as finite transducers , producing intonationally relevant categories as output  . The design criteria included maximal restriction of computational power  ( the system could be compiled into one massive finite transducer  )  ; relevance to computational linguistic formalisms with a view to developing an integrated model mapping prosodic structures onto textual structures  ; relatability to speech recognition algorithms , and to phonological theories . It was implemented in an object oriented environment with parallel processing simulation  ( Che OPS )  , and a linguistically interesting surface language  ( BATLAN )  . 
1. Aims and design criteria
In this paper a new architecture for the parallel processing of feature systems  , particularly in phonology , is presented and applied to data-directed prosodic parsing in English  . It uses independent feature processing modules in configurations which allow Parallell  , Sequential , Incremental ( PSI ) or Parallel , Hierarchical , Incremental ( PHI ) processing of phonetic data by the modules , with linguistically relevant output ( in this case , prosodic categorie such as pitch accent ) . 
The domain of prosodic features ( especially intonation , stress or accent , tone ) has not yet received significant attention from computational linguists  . It poses problems which are rather different from the phoneme or letter concatenation models typically used in computational models of written language  . In particular , the problems concern the parallel processing of segmental and suprasegmental features in functionally and structurally partly autonomous tiers  ; an architecture for this purpose has to be able to cope with a variety of different synchronisation protocols for feature modules and module clusters  . In addition , a prosodic parser has to translate from a detailed phonetic feature representation into a more abstract prosodic structure suitable for mapping onto lexical items in syntactic  , semantic and pragmatic on texts . 
Several styles of computation a lrchitecture could be used for this purpose  , from relatively ad hoc blackboard architectures to the kind of virtual  , abstract parallelism tbr feature processing in unification granmaars  . The selec'~ion criteria used here included : 1 Maximal restriction of computational power in terms of time and space bounds  . 
2 Conceptual compatibility with computational inguistic formalisms used at other linguistic levels  , with a view to developing an integrated model . 
3 As far as possible , relatability to speech recognition algorithms . 
4 Suitability as a simulator for phonological theories of the autosegmental type  . 
It would appear at first sight to be a nearly impossible task to fulfil all these criteria at once  . However , study of each of these areas revealed that a concept using finite automata  ( in particular , finite transducers ) to simulate the feature modules , and partly parallel , partly cascaded configurations of these to simulate feature clusters and autosegment altiers comes close to satisfying them  , including the speech recognition requirement ( cf . the hidden Markov models , Levinson 1986) . 
A secondary aim was to develop a versatile work bench for such descriptions  . A linguistically interesting and useful surface language for transition networks  ( BATLAN , Eikmeyer/Gibbon 1983 ) was selected for formulating the feature modules , and provided with control mechanisms for parallel and  ( unidirectionally ) cascaded modules , clusters and tiers with different modes of synchronisation and interaction  . 
The implementation was developed in an object oriented programming environment with facilities for the simulation of parallel processing  ( Che OPS , Eikmeyer 1986) . 
2 . The PSI/PHI architecture and prosodicpa ~ ing The PSI/PHI concept is suitable for application to other linguistic domains which can be modelled with parallel feature processing  . A pure PSI system ( using finite automata in feature modules ) is weakly equivalent to massive single finite automaton  , though obviously with greater expressive power , while a pure PHI system ( using pushdown automata in feature modules ) could be used to process languages up to and including context sensitive indexed languages  . The prosodic parsing application is a pure PSI system  . The PHI facility is to provide ATN-Iikc facilities if require ~ l  . The feature modnlcm~tomata arelbrmulate zt as finite transition et works  . 
hit he prosodic parsing application , rite PSI system has a two 4 evel cascade structure , each consisting of parallel tiers of ~ baturt : s trodtbature clusters ? The configuration used at present in a " stress : parser*~lbrGerman is show u in Figure  1  . 
In Put to the parser consists of parallel chmmels of ' digit is exl signal paracneter such as intensity or fundamental ti'equeney  ( other spettral parameters could also be used )  . The initial ' hm ture detector ( FI . )) level plays a specific fimctional role ; it has the task of simulating the classical five tasks of a feature detector : parameter identification  , time window specification , smootifing ? unction , segmentatiou algorithm ~ aud classification ( value ~ , migmnent ) algorithm . Fairly simple feature models for acoustic edge -detection  ( zero crossing , slope maxima ) and contour detection ( peak etc . ) are fbHnulated as transition network tr ~atsducers  . Since the input signal is a continuous stream of '   ; n definite length , the transducers are not assigned special finite , states , but can in ; stoppex lany where .

The second level takes the primitively segmented output of the FD level and filters out the relevant prosodic categories and category sequences  . 
The two remaining parallel levels of accent seqnences  ( in the case of the present parser ) and segmental phonetic transcription ( without syllable or word boundaries ) are both fed into the textual ruapping component . The main cornponent lug \] so far implemented is the lexicon  , formulated as a classical discrimination et transducer  . The output from the lexicon is_TI~J\]at present an orthographic representation with underlining of  ~1 accented words . 
The feature module representations defined by these levels are shown in Figure  2  . Attile top is a representation of two digitised sigaal parameters  . The first group of " feature tapes " shows the output of the FD level  , with upward , downward and centrals pikes representing binary o1' tertiary valucx t features , and dots representing null output . Tile second gl ' oup shows the output of tile FC level  , with considerably more sparse representation of datadriven abstraction hypotheses about possible occurrences of prosodic categories  . The other two levels show outputs within tile textual mapping component  . 

Close attention has been paid to the empirical basis of this application  . Results of experimental phonetic studies were used in formulating the FDs  , and accent perception tests were conducted in order to verify the output of the PSI system against native listeners  ( Braun & Jin 1987 )  . The tests yielded a satisfyingly high rate of approx  .  85% . Within a homogeneous dialect group the parser is speaker-independent  ; the data are " raw " instructions for constructing blocks worlds  , and include hesitations and repairs . 
The application is being developed within a project group financed by the DFG  ( Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft ) to include further prosodic categories and a suitable syntax with strategies for coping with special speech processe such as slips and repairs  . The pragmatic-semantic level of the rue-rheme and focus structures has already been defined for restricted blocks worlds dialogues  ( Pignataro 1987 ) and will be incorporated into an automatic focus assignment system  . 
Other , sta'ucturally different , or less expressive , or more heterogeneou systems using finite devices  ( particularly in phonology and phonetics )  , are being studied with a view to extending areas of application of the PSI/PHI architecture  ( cf .
