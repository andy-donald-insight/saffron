While systems like l ; hat of ( Hahnel , al . , 1996 ) deal with the general acquisition of concepts , we are concerned exclusively with the acquisition of s  ( A'ucl ; ural linguistic infornmtion . 
All , hough we deal here with German noun in-ttection , in a ti'amework close to that of ( Riehemann , 1998) and ( Koenig ,  1999) , the techniques are language-indel ) endent a dal ) ply to other ldnds of lexical inibrmation as well , as is shown in ( Walther and Barg , 1998) with respect ovalency in tbn nation . 
Thus , in contrast to ( Ehrlich and Rapaport ,  1997) , who employ tailored algorithms for the acquisition of intbn national  ) out nouns and verbs , we introduce an apl ) roac . h thai ; is CO ml/let ely general with ) ' esl ) ect to the kind of structura linguistic information acquire &  2 German noun-inflection classes There is a w/st literature on German noun inflection represented in recent studies by  ( Cahill and Gazdar ,  1999) , ( Clahsen ,  1999) , and ( Neef ,  1998) . Here west mnnarize only essential points and ignore highly irregular and archaicinilections  ( cf . figure 4 below ) . 
Gernmn nouns l ) eargender ( masculine , t bininine , neutt , r ) and are inflected for number ( singular , 1) lu-rail and case ( nontilmt . ive , accusative , dat . ive , geni-(ire ) . \ Vith the exeq )(; ion of class NWN(e . g . mast Ha . ' uvr'farn wr':wi(;hgensgf ~ aucrn , ) , all nonfl:minine nouns build genitive singular with-s  . 
The " regular " ( of . () lahsen (1999)) but ; " atytfi-cal " ( cf . \\ qlnderlich (1999)) nouns of class NA ( e . g . 
Auto~car ') build their plural forms in-s . The l ) lural forms of all o(; her ( i . e . % yl ) ical ' )   ( : lasses nmstendilla socalled schwa syllable - c  , - el , - c'r , or-en(i . e .

S( ; l' ( )llg lIOllllS add - e for l ) luralill class NS ( e . g . 
A'r'm , ' arm ', p m , c ) and class NU ( e . g . d ~' zt'l ) hysi-clan ' , pl/r  ztc ) if ( ; hesl ; enl itself does not already end in asch wa syllable  ( e . g . Kabcl ' cable ', plKa-bell . Class NU fl wther more umlauts the stem ( i . e . 
replaces a , o ,   , it , , au with ii ,  5 , ii , iiu , respectively ) , as does (: lass NR ( e . g . Mann'man',pl\]V Ii inncr ), which adds-er . 
The remaining (: lasses ( NM , NWN , and NWS ) t ' on n their plural ill-n(e . g . Schraube'screw ', plSch , rauben) . The nonnominative singular stenlin class NWN ( e . g . lIasc'hare ', gensgHasen ) and class NWS(e . g . Glaub c ' belief ' , gensg Glaub cns ) is identical with the phlral for nL while N\VN excel >  (  ; iolmlly adds no-singenitive singular . 
All ( : lasses except NA build dative plural by adding - n  (  ; othephn ' al Ibrmif it is not already present ( e . g . Miinncr'men ', datpl Miinncrn but

Pollard (1994)) . 
We neither adopt a word-syntaxal ) proach like that of ( Krieger and Nerbonne ,  1 . 993 ) assunfing lexical entriest brinflectional affixes as well as roots  , nor do we make use of lexical rules , as ( Meurers and Minnen , 1997) do . 
Instead , we follow ( Riehemmm , 1 . 998 ) informulating hierarchically structured schemata of the kinds he has developed for derivational morphology l  ) ut apply them here to inflection and thus carry out a kind of inflectional analysis without lexical rules as projected by  ( Erjavec ,  1996) . Our schemata capture inflectional paradigms and can be regarded as rela  . tional constraints that relate stems , affixes , and inflected lexical forms . 
Figure 1 shows our hierarchy of inttectional schemata , wl file figure 2 illustrates a concrete schema , namely that t br the schwaplural of inflectional ( : lass NS . Ill figure 2l ; he attribute f type stands f br the intlectional class  . The attributes flex , surf , and base represent strings , namely the inflection alending , surface ( i . e . inflected ) tbrm , and baseform respectively . The symbol@denotes the reduced vowel\[o\] ( schwa )  , and - designates negated values . 
Lexical entries are assmned only for basic lexical signs  ( i . e . uninflected but possibly derived or compounded ) . Inflected lexical signs result from the interaction of these lexical entries and the inflectional sehenlata  . Figure 3 gives the basic lexical sign ( with the onfission of feature specifications that are irrel-ewmt for this discussion  ) for Hund'dog ' , which is of class NS , followed by the inflected lexical signt brHunde ' dogs '  , in which the value of the attribute moph ( i . e . morphophonology ) is an extension of the schema for schwaphlral given in figure  2  . 
The inflectional classes assigned to basic lexical signs are modelled as formal types in the hierarchical structure specified in figure  4  . Note that the leaves of this tree correspond exactly to the inflectional classes of German nouns as described above in  2  .

Here ( here al ( sat ( on of the plural ending-'ndel ) ends on the shape of tlm nouns teul ( nalnely , whether or not it ends in asch wasyllable ) . In agreement with ( Bird and Klein , 1994) and ( Er\]avec ,  1996) , we capture such alternations declaratively in a one-level model without recourse to transducers  . 
Our treatment of umlaut adopts part of the techniques of  ( % ' ost ,  1993) . 
4 Processing unknown words
In our al ) proach linguistic prol ) erties of unlcnown words are inferred fl'om their sentential context as a byproduct of parsing  . After parsing , which requires only a slight modification of sl ; and ard lexical lookup , lexical entries a real ) propriately updated . 
One of our key ideas is a gradual , information-based concept of " unknownness " , where lexical entries are not unknown as a whole , but may contain unknown , i . e . potentially revisable , pieces of information ( cf . 
Barg and Walther (1998)) . This allows a uniform treatment fortile full range of lexical entries from completely known to maximally unknown  . As discussed in ( Barg and Walther ,  1998) , our system has been implemented in MicroCUF , a derivative of the tbrmalism CUF of ( D Srre and Dorna ,  1993) .

NWNNWS and gender(gend ) are specializable , case is generalizable and hence contains the features gen and ctxt  . 
Note that the initial values for specializable information consist of a disjunction  (  ; ) of the value u_s and the most general appropriate value for the corresponding feature  . This ensures the identification of specializable infornlation  ( via ~ t_s ) on the one hand , and the correct specializations on the other . 
\ Vhen a sentence containing ant ln known noun is parsed  , infbrmation about the noun conies from different som'ces : while the surrounding context lnay supply agreement information  , the word for nl itself together with morphol ) honological constraints may restrict the possible inflectional class  . 
As an examt ) le we can suppose that the rather infrequent noun Sund's ound '  , ' strait ' , which like It ' und ' dog ' belongs to class NS but is unfalniliar to in any German speakers  , is not recorded in a given lexicon . 
The class NS contains both masculine and neuter nouns  , and these differill none of their inflected forms  . Thus , only agreement information from a context , such as dcrcnge ? ' und ' the narrow strait ' ( nonfinative )  , call establish the gender of S . w(t d as being masculine .

Even in isolation , the for lnSund must be singular since its final shape is not coml  ) a tible with any phlral inflection ( i . e . it ends neither ill-snorillasch wasyllable )  . Moreover , the morphoplionological constraiuts on stems allow only three possibilities : 
S ' und is ? femiuine ( and then tile class is NA , NU , or NM and tile case is underspecified ) ? nonfenfinine and weak ( i . e .   ( : lass NWN or NWS )   ( and tlmn the case must be nominative ) ? nonfbminine and nonweak ( and then the case is not genitive ) These hypotheses are captured in the three feature structures depicted in figure  6  . 
As we have seen , when a word is parsed in context , this provides additional information . If we know , for exaln ple , that S~tn disl nasculine , the first hypothesis is excluded , and the gender specification of the remaining two hylm theses can be specializ & ltomasc  . 
If we additionally encounter S ' und ill dative singular  , which is impossible for weak nouns ( which nmst have a final-n )  , then only the third hypothesis remains . Finally , if the plural form S ' und c occurs the system can specialize the inflectional class exactly to the type NS  . The other morphological information cammt be further generalized or specialized  , and we have the final lexical entry fbr Sund . 
Things are not always this easy . In particular , there may be a number of alternatives both fbr the segmentation of a form into a stem and an inflection alending and ibr the ~ ssignment of a stein to a lexeme  . Moreover , these alternatives may depend on each other . Thus , the form L cincn may be assigned to any of the lexemes Lein ' flax '  ( masc , NS ) , Leine ' rope ' ( fern , NM ) , or Leincn'linen'(neut , NS ); even in a context , e . g . F'ritz verkauftLeinen'Fritzsell sropes/linen  '  , it may be impossible to disambiguate the form . While the nouns B and ' book volume ' ( mase , NU ) , B and ' strip ' ( neut , NR ) , B and ' bond ' ( neut , NS , archaic and rare in singular ) , B and ' music band'(fern , NA ) , and B and e ' gang'(fern , NM ) may be unlikely to occur all in the same context , they il hlstrate the dimension of the t ) roblems of segmentation and lexical assignnlent , which in turn coil--basic_Is basi cf type(ns ; nu , nm ; u_s ) surf\[\]sundbase\[\]ayfl"moph\[casc_avn \[ case/ctxt  ( - a , sctgrL gen'u_qhum ( , siny ; u_ , s)gend(fcm;u_~)~ers third synsem . . .

6 An a l te rnat ive mode l us ing f inite-state techniques Alternatively  , the incremental identifieation of inflectional types can be modelled within the Dame-work of finite-state automata  ( cf . Sln'oat ( 1992 ) ) without recourse to unification-based grammar formalisms  . AFSA can be defined that has an all ) ha-1 ) et consisting of vectors specifying the stem shal ) e and ending ( and thus the segmentation ) as well as tim a green l cnt inforniation of possible word forms  . 
Starting in an initial state corresponding to the constraints that apply to all unknown words  , the FSA is moved by successive forms of an unknown lexeme together with their agreement information into suc-cesso  , " states that capture the incrementally accrued inflectional intbrmation  . The FSA may reach a final state , in which case tile intlectional class has l ) een uniquely idenl ; ified , or it nlay renmin in a nonfinal state . A lexic . on would siml ) ly recoMtile latest state roached for each ll ( )llll . 
Iml fl cn lentation of t . his model is greatly complicated by the problems of  ( lisambiguation just discussed ini5 . In general , the states of the FSA must capture disjmmtions not only of intlectional classes  , lint also of segmentation and gender alternatives . 
The application of automatic induction techniques to corpora appears to be essential  , and we are currently f ) ursuing possibilities for this . 
7 Conclusion
We have taken the inflec . tion of German nouns to illustrate a generalty l ) e-based at/1 ) roach to handling ult kl to wll words alia the ill crell lent alaccrual of their lexical information  . The techniques can beal ) l/lied not only to other classes of inflected words and to other languages  , 1) ut also to other aspects of lexical informal ; ion such as the valency of verbs . This may allow practical systems for natural anguage processing to be enhanced so as to utilize input infornlation that otherwise is discarded as noise  .
