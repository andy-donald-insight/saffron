In this paper we describe a syntactic semantic parser of spo-  . 
ken sentences pertaining to a subset of natural Italian language  . Error-free and fast analysis , partial interpretation ability , man-machine dialogue trend , different semantic environment adaptability and natural language usage are its main characteristics  . All of these features are supported by a technique of input reliability evaluation  . Particular attention is devoted to the description of the knowledge internal representation and of the mechanism that manages  , at different points of the analysis , the whole process . 
I . PARSER QUALIFICATIONS
The parser to be described performs its analysis starting from an intrinsically unreliable input that is the result of an isolated word speech recognizer  . The lack of certainty on the single items of the input sentence is one of the main problems in such a vocal parser  . The representation of each uttered word , following the recognition stage , is , in fact , an ordered list of possible interpretations with associated dissimilarity measures  . As a consequence , it is possible to have doubts not only about every single word of the sentence  , but also on complete sentence parts . Moreover , irre coverable recognition errors may require the capability of parsing incomplete sentences  .

EXAM PLEO FATY PICALIN PUTO FTHE PARSER Fig .   1 shows an example of a typical parsing input where each input word is repla-ced by a complete lis t of possible alternatives with associated distance score  . It is interesting to notice that not only the sentence that was actually spoken " TO-GLITUTTO DALLASTANZA "  ( = remove everything from the room )  , is reported but , in this case , also some other correct sentences can be found by the parser  ( for example " COSTRUISCIUNTAVOLOQUAD RATO " ( build a square table )   . 
An efficient parser must also be able to solve other problems not strictly connected to a particular kind of input  . In fact it should , of course , achieve fast ope-rations ; that requires the ability to minimize the number of alternative parses \[ l\]  . 
Furthermore the parser should be designed in such awayas to satisfy the " genera-lity " expectations  ; that is it should be easily adaptable to any semantic domain at least in the limited semantic domain cases  . Since the parser results should be followed by the execution of some operation in any practical application it is requiTred that it produced trusty results and  , in particular , that it always included the right sentence interpretation within all the output ones  . 
Finally , to allow a graceful dialogue with its users the parser must be able to analyse also partial sentences  ( for example elliptical or fragmentary ones  )  , thus maZking it possible to use naturally expressed sentences  C2\]  . 
2. MAIN PARSER'S CHARACTERISTICS
The main features of our parser , that permit to satisfy the above mentioned requi-rements  , are the following : I ) representation of the language in terms of a network whose elements are syn-tactic groups and syntactic features  ;  2 ) definition of a confidence measure of the recognition results and its extension also to groups of words  ( syntactic groups )  ;  3 ) adoption of a recursive working strategy which anchors the parsing on the most reliable words in a first step and on the most reliable groups in a second one  . 
We selected the furnishing of a living room as the discourse domain and we defined a vocabulary of a  I16 words . 
This vocabulary , although limited , leads to a total number of over 10   5 possible sentences that include commands for constructing or moving pieces of furniture  , assignment of labels , def ~ of unit lengths , inquiries about mutual distances ~-- e-TCT . 
2.1. Language representation
We describe each sentence of the language by a sequence of syntactic groups  . Asy~tactic group is defined as a sentence part with a well precise semantic meaning  . 
Often , but not necessary , a syntactic group corresponds to a classical grammatical object  . For example , we defined the verb , the direct object , the location object , etc . 
In this way ( see Fig .  2 ) each sentence of the langudge can be described by a sequence of some of these groups  . 
On the whole we introduced only 9 groups ; in our opinion this set of syntactic groups is enough to describe  , at a syntactic level , all the possible sentences p e ~ taining to this semantic environment  .

Each syntactic group is , in turn , represented by a number of possible word sequences  , or , mere precisely , of sequences of associated syntactic features . Figure 3 shows , for example , how the direct object is represented .

DIRECTOBJECT REPRESENTATION
It is important to notice ~ n ~ Lu , u Teature can represent mere than one word and every new word does not always need a new feature definition  . So the present vocabulary can be easily increased to a certain degree within the semantic domain  , without any change in the grammar . 
2.2. Reliability evaluation
The doubts connected with the vocal input suggested the need for a tool that measured the goodness of each word recognition  . To this purpose a method to evaluate the reliabi lity of recognition results was defined  \[3\]  . 
40 LBORGHES l and C . FAVARETO
By this method every word , in the ordered list , is associated with a confidence score indicating its probability of being the correct one  ( see Fig .  4) .

In this way , as described below , the most reliable words of the sentence can bese lected and the parser anchored to them  . The same reliability score is also used to evaluate the syntactic groups found and to decide which  , among alternative groups , is the most probable one . 
2.3 Island driven work in 9 strategy
All the operations of the parser are centered around the concept of reliability score  . In fact , in a first step , the parser anchors its analysis to the most reliable word of the sentence  ( that we named " guide word " ) and searches , both to the right and to the left of it for al l the syntactic groups that include the features associated to the guide word  . Each of these syntactic groups is named " island " . 
Not only the first word in the ordered list can be used for this aim  , but sometimes also the second and the third ones are taken into consideration  . For each island a cumulative reliability score  , function of the single word scores , is computed . 
The same procedure is then applied to the remaining words until the whole sentence has been examined and there are no more guide words  ; at this point a lattice of island , possibly overlapping , is obtained . 
In a second step the parser , in an almost identical fashion as before , searches for the most reliable island ( that we named " guide island " )  , anchoring to it the exploration of the language network to get a match with one of the possible sentences  . 
When this is not possible , because of very unreliable recognition of a whole syntactic group  , the partial sentence recovered is proposed in output together with a hypothesis about the missing constituent  . 
At this point a module for graceful man-machine interaction could be activated  , in order to obtain the needed information by means of an appropriate dialogue  . 
In addition there are some parameters , specifying the number of retained alternati-ves at various points of the parsing  , that allow to control parser's performance both in terms of speed and confidence  . These parameters allow the parser to work with different degrees of flexibility and so  , they must be carefully selected , according to the application , i . e . according to the risk that can be tolerated when accepting an acoustically unclear sentence  .

INTOTHEROOM
The input sentence is : PUTTHEROUNDTABLEINTO THEROOM  . In the first step , star-ting respectively from the Ist , 2nd and 3rd guide word ( PUT , ROUND , THE ) , the parser finds some possible islands with associated reliability score  . In a second step , starting from the guide island the parser searches a match between a path in the language network and the islands  . The final result is the correct interpretation of the sentence even if there were three recognition errors  . 
Sometimes the parser outputs are not univocal as in the previous example  . In fact , if the reliability score of a whole island is too low  , the parser provides an output in which , instead of a detailed word-by-word interpretation  , an hypothesis about the type of the missing syntactic group appears as shown in the example below : PUT < direct object > INTHEMIDDLEOF THEROOMIf  , on the contrary , tnere are two or more words with approximately the same reliability score and the same syntactic role  , then the parser supplies in the output-those alternatives with their associated reliabili ty score s and the whole decision will be deferred to a following pragmatic module or dialogue component  . For example we can have an output like this one : PUTTHEITABLECHAIR  . 32 . 29 INUMBERTWOINFRONTOFTHEDOOR 4 . RESULTS The present parser has been tested on a ' set of  50 sentences spoken by three different speakers ( two males and one female )  . A poor word recognizer was adopted in order to stress parser's capabilities  . We compare in tablel the parser performance T and those of the recognizer a ~ one  . For each speaker the first column reports the percent of success of the recognizer alone  , i . e . how many times all the words of a sentence were in the first position  . The second column reports the percent of suc-ces of the parser  ( i . e . how many times the parser was able to interpret the sentence  )  . 
Each row corresponds to a case in which there are , respectively , none , l ,  2 , and 3 lost islands whose reliability was not sufficient to take any decision  . 
42 L . BORGHESI and C . FAVARETO
We want to notice that for the Ist speaker the parser locates the correct sentence in the  92% of the cases and achieves a 96% correct interpretation if it assumes that there is one lost island  . For the 2 nd speaker these values increase more slowly because of a very unreliable input  ( 10% of success for the recognizer )  . 
However the main result is that the parser never took a decision that did not contain the correct interpretation  .

PERCENTOFSENTENCERECOGNITION ( see text ) 5 . CONCLUSIONS We have described a parser of spoken sentences in which the design decisions taken are a necessary step to satisfy the requirements of a voice interactive system  . 
In fact the choice of using features instead of vocabulary entries and of descri-bing the sentences in terms of syntactic groups agrees with the needs of improving the analysis speed  , of making the semantic environment representation oriented to a partial interpretation analysis and of allowing the adaptability to differents e mantic environments  . 
Finally we want to notice the characteristics that make this parser oriented to a graceful man -machine interaction  . They are its ability to provide in the output more than one choice with its associated reliab ility score and its ability to interpret alo partial input  . 
The first characteristic , in fact , allows a pragmatic module to make a choice among various alternatives  , looking at their reliability score or , if in doubt , to activate a dialogue module which requests the needed information  . The second characteristic permits the management of a dialogue in which also ellipt ical sentences are allowed or  , any how , the maximum freedom of expression is permitted .
