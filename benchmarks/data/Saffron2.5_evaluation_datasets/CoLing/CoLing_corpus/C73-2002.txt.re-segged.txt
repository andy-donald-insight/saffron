THEFkEQUENCYDISTRIBUTION OFENGLISH SYNTAGMS
J . . INTRODUCTION
People use language principally as a means of communication  , 
each language community determining the scope of the particular language it uses  . Within the language , various sets and subsets may exist depending upon regional and social differences  . Most studies of such subsets have been concerned with lexical variations  . In this paper , a methodology is outlined by which the frequency usage of syntactic structures can be measured for subsets of a language  , and for a language as a whole . 
In order to establish omogeneity features within a subset  , reliance is made on calculations of chisquare on batches of sentences within the subset  . Before considering whether or not a more sensitive test should be applied to detect significant differences within and among subsets of a language  , it seemed advisable to determine the frequency distribution of syntagms throughout particular genres  . An extension of the methodology to accomplish this objective is described and the results for one type of syntactic structure within one genre are tabulated  . These results indicate that the frequency distribution of syntagms within these limitations approximates to a Poisson distribution  . 
2. METHODOLOGY
There are five main steps in the methodology : the isolation of each and every syntagmin the corpus of sentences  ; the assembly of the isolated syntagms into a matrix  , each row of which contain syn-Acknowledgements .

BEEBE tagms having the same head-character ; the comparison , for particular syntagms , of the frequencies with which the syntagms occur in different genres  ; the record-keeping of the quantities of sentences in which particular syntagms occur once  , twice ,  . . . n times ; and the comparison of those quantities with standard statistical distributions  . 
The first step in the isolation of the syntagms is the transcription of the syntactic structure of the sentences into linearized form  , prepar-atory to their being used in the computer . 
A criterion used for the selection of a grammar on which to base the syntactic structure description was that  , for purposes additional to those required for this investigation  , amely the support of remedial English-teaching courses  , a manual system of parsing had to be provided for use by other users reasonably familiar with traditionally-accepted terminology  . The methodology was designed to provide a means whereby comparisons of genres for frequency-usage of syntactic structures could be made  , so that teaching courses for particular genres could emphasize the structures most frequendy used in those genres  . 
The methodology had to be such that users quite unfamiliar with computer techniques could prepare the data in suitable form for feeding into the computer  , and use prepared programs to obtain the necessary results  . 
For the above reasons , a dependency grammar was selected , details of which are shown in Figs . 1 and 2 .

The method for linearizing syntactic trees , such as those shown typically in Fig .  2 , was based on the line-formula chemical notation developed by W  . J . W is wesser(W . j .

Typical Linearization of a Sentence starting from the first character of a sentence group such as the subject group  , verb group , or object group , and proceeding from the hftmost path of the tree , characters are recorded in sequential order until a termination of a branch of the tree is reached  . At that point , a return to the nearest branching point in the tree is made  , recording a dash for each step retraced from the terminating point othe branching point  . 
The next leftmost path is then followed with the same retracing  proc-12   1L~LPH D . BEEBEess until all the paths in the group have been followed to their termina-tions  . A boundary-marker is then inserted in the linearization to mark the boundary between the subject group and the verb group  , and the procedure repeated for the verb group until all the paths in that group have similarly been followed  . Another boundary marker is then insert-ed in the linearization  , and the next group is then processed until the end of the sentence has been reached  .

Typical Linearization of a Sentence The data is then key-punched in the following sequence : a header card for the number and title of the batch of sentences  ; a card for the natural text of the sentence ; a card for the linearization . 
This data is then fed into the computer , where it is processed by a very simple program which contains the following instructions : read the characters in the linearization one by one  , and if the first character is alphabetical , prep are a record string commencing with the numeral  1  . If the next character in the linearization is also alphabetical  , increment this numeral by one and enter the result in the next position in the record string  . Continue so doing until a dash is met . For a dash , reduce the numeral by one , and for a group boundary marker , recordazero . The effect of this program is to produce for each sentence a record string of numerals  , as shown in Fig .  2 , corresponding to the level numbers of the nodes in the syntactic tree  . 
THEFREQUENCYDISTRIBUTION OFENGLISH SYNTAGMS 13 The header card , the natural text card , and the linearization card are then transferred to magnetic tape records together with the numerical record string representing the assignment of the levels  . These records are then available for calling upon for processing for the isolation of the syntagms  . 
The isolation procedure commences by first drawing the records of the linearizations  , one at a time , into an array , while at the same time drawing the corresponding record of level numbers into another array  . Both arrays are then scanned simultaneously under the following conditions : each character of the linearization is transferred as it is scanned  , to a further array , while the level numbers corresponding to the characters are checked until a number is encountered less invalue than the number of the first character in the linearization  . The transferred string of characters then represents the syntagm which has been isolated  . 
The scanning process is then repeated starting from the next character in the linearization until the next syntagm has been isolated  . 
The procedure is continued starting from successive characters in the linearization until all the characters in the linearization have been processed  . 
As they are produced , the isolated syntagms are fed into the appropriate rows of a matrix  , so that each row contains only syntagms having the same head character  . Before each syntagmis entered into a row of the matrix  , the previous entries in that row are scanned to see if a similar syntagm has already been entered  . Only when there has been no previous entry of a similar syntagm  , is a new syntagmentered in that row . If there has been a similar entry , a frequency count adjacent to the entry is incremented by one  . 
Optionally , each new entry can have an additional entry inserted adjacent to it of the dominant node in the syntactic tree  . The depth of the syntagm , calculated by subtracting the level of the head character from the maximum level of the syntagm  , is also entered , as is the length , calculated by adding the number of characters , including dashes , in the line notation for the syntagm . 
A control feature is included , which permits the matrix either to be cleared at the end of a batch  , or to stay filled so that syntagms from successive batches of the same genre can be added  , to produce cumulative results . 
Kows of the matrix can be selectively printed.
At the endo far un , a summary of the entries in each row of the 14 RALPHD . BEEBE matrix is made . The type/token ratio is calculated by dividing the number of discrete entries by the total number of syntagms in the row  . 
Graphic plotting programs have been written to displays catter diagrams of length against depth  , of quantities of discrete and of total syntagms against quantity of sentences  , and of type/token ratios against quantity of sent onces  . See Figs . 3 and 4 .

A refinement of the parsing allows the inclusion of left and right arrow heads to display departures from arbitrarily-selected norms of the linear order of the words of the natural text  . Comparisons of quantities of syntagms with and without such arrow heads provide measures of the actual departures from the norms  , and thereby provide an evaluation of the validity of the norms  . The levels-assignment program contains a provision for not changing the level when scanning a subcategorization number or an arrow head  . 
As each syntagmis isolated and fed into the matrix  , a corresponding entry is made in a duplicate matrix  , this second entry containing the number of times that the syntagm has been found in the one sentence  . 
When the end of the sentence has been reached , there is also entered at that point in the second matrix an adjacent entry of an increment in an array at a position corresponding to the number of times that the syntagm was found in that sentence  . The second matrix therefore contains a growing record of the number of sentences in which the syntagmappears once  , twice . . . . n times . 
From preliminary investigations , it was found that n rarely exceed-edten . The provision of an array with fourteen elements was therefore ample for the keeping of such records  . 
Usage frequencies extracted from the first matrix can be used as input data for a chisquare calculation program to ascertain the homogeneity of usage within a batch of sentences  , or to find if there are significant differences between genres  . See Tables 36 .

RESULTS No significant differences were found in the relative proportions of particular syntagms  ( prepositional phrases , in the cases displayed ) among Batches 110 of one genre ( newspaper editorials )  , although difference significant at the . 0 5 level were noted among Batches 1120 of the same genre . When the totals for each group often batches were compared  , however , there were no significant differences . 
Four batches of another genre , Higher School Certificate Exami-nation ( University Entrance ) Essays , produced no significant differences within the genre  , but did produce significant differences at the . 0 1 level when compared with tile same number of sentences from the previous genre  . 
It appears from the results obtained that the frequency usage of syntactic structures is a valid criterion of distinctiveness  , and can be used as a means of comparing enres . 
The entries in the second matrix give the frequency distribution of each syntagm within the corpus  . See Table 7 .
