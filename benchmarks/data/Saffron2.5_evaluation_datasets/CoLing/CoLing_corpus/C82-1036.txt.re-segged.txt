We contrast two approaches to thesaurus production : the traditional and intuitive one versus the Amsler-type procedure  , which interactively 9 , enerates filiations among the genus words in a computerized dictionary  . We discuss the application of such a or ocedure to our lexical database  ( LONDONDICTIONARY OF CONTEd POR ARYENGLISH )  . 
IINTRODUCTION
Since 1979 we have had available , by contract with LON ~ , I/u NL td , the c ( :mputertape of LDOCE ( IDNCUqNDICTIO~NARY OF CON rlT/'IPOP~LRY\[ iNGLISH  )  . Our main concern has been the development of a syntactico-semantic analyzer of general " English making full use of all the formatted information contained in our dictionary file  . (\lichiels et al1980; ~ lichiels 1982) . 
LDOCE is a medit ~ a-sized dictionary of core English containing some  60  , O O0 entries which feature the following types of information : a  ) fully formalized
Part of speech ( POS )
Grammatical fields , i . e . sets of grarmnatical codes , which describe the environment that the code -bearing item can or must fit in  . 
l %% at makes these grammatical fields particularly suitable for the purposes of machine disambiguation of natural language is that they are assigned to word senses  ( definitions ) as well as to whole lexical entries . An example is provided by the LDOCE entry CONSIDER  ( p .  233) . 
in the example , string
I consider you a fool the two-NP chain ( YOUA FOOL ) satisfies the \[ XI~code associated with the
NP INP 2 second definition of the verb and enables the analyzer to select the appropriate definition in context  ( " scanning procedures ": cf . qichiels et al 1980)
Definition space , i.e.
( i ) semantic codes : inherent features for nouns , selectional restrictions for adjectives and verbs Consider the entry  HA~?4ER   , verb . As the definition space does not appear in the printed version  , we J refer the reader to the computer file where , for the third definition , the semantice odes indicate that bo~h the deep subject and the deep object must be O~'i  . e . 5 ~ r ' ~ kN\] . 
( ii ) subject codes ( ~ld labels ) ix : In the entry H~M ~ , def . 3 is assigned SPXXiSports ) and def . 5 BCZS(EC : Economics , Z : subdivision indicator , S : Stock ix change and Investment ) . 
b ) partly formalized
In most dictionaries , definitions are nothing else but strings of natural language  , albeit of a special type ( Smith and Maxwell 1973 ; Amsler 1980 , p . I08) . A first step towards formalizing definitions has been taken by the LD  ( XI Elericographers : all the LIX ) C~examples and definitions are written in a controlled defining vocabulary of some  2  , 100 items ( lexemes-e . g . HISTORY - and morphemes - e . g . RE-and-IZATION-no morphological variants ) . 
Our concern in this paper will be with how to produce thesauri from dictionary files  . What prompts us to examine this problem is the existence of two contrasting approaches to thesaurus-production : the first is exemplified by LOLHX  ( LON6 MANLEXICON OF CONTEMPORARY 19~GLISH , J 981) , the second by Amsler 1980 . 
IITHESAURUSPRODUCTION
Although LOLEX takes over a subset of the ~ definitions  , both the choice of thesauric categories ( e . g . J . 212 verbs : DISMISSING A hDRh-TIRING PEOPLE ) and the assignment of a lexical item to one of several categories  ( e . g . DISBAND assigned to J .  212 ) are based on the lexicographer's intuition and knowledge of prcvlous work in the field  ( cf . l~get's , etc . ) . 
Amsler's approach is totally different ( see Amsler 1980 ) : using as database the computer files of the MPD  ( Merriam Pocket Dictionary ) prepared by John O\]ney ( Olrtey 1968 )  , he develops an interactive procedure for thesaurus production  . The first step is a manual selection and disambiguation of the GHqUS  TEI~4S in the definitions of nouns and verbs . ByGENUSTERM is to be understood the first word of the definition which has the same POS as the definienduma ~ d can serve as its superordinate  . For example , in the first definition of HAMMER , the genus term is STRIKE , whereas in the fifth it is DECLARE . 
It should be realized t ~ hatgen us term and syntactic head do not always coincide  , and this mismatch is a major obstacle in the development of autocratic procedures for genus term selection  . Contrast in this respect tho first and the second homographs of the LDOCE head word BOA  ( page IO 5 )  . The second poses no problem : syntactic head and genus term are identical  ( GARMENT ) ? In the first , however , the genus term is lodged inside the second OF -phrase  , itself embedded in the first , which in its turn depends on the syntactic head ANY  . 
Once they have been selected , the genus terms are disambiguated with reference to the database itself by selecting the appropriate homograph and definition numbers  . A convenient example , drawn from LDOCE , ~s the disambiguation of the genus term CONSIDER in the definitions of LOOKON  ( LX9 esp . as , wit~: to consider ; regard ) CONSIDER here will be disambiguated as CONSIDER ( m , 2) (~= non?h on Dgraphic , 2= second definition-cf . LDOCE entry CONSIDER , po253 ) The next step is the use of a tree-growing a lgorithm  , which Amsler has progr~ed and applied to his MPD database  . It is based on a filiation technique between l ~xical entries and genus terms  . We shall illustrate it with respect to the item VEHICLE  ( x , 1) in our own database . Descending the filiation path , the procedure will select all the items which use ~ he word V~HICLE  ( w , 1) as genus term in their definitions . Among these are CAR(x , ' I/2/3) and CARRIAGE(x , I/2/7) . CARRIAGE in tm'n functions as a genusterm and yields its own subclass  , which contains , mnong others , the items BROUGHAM(x , x-non-homographic + a single definition ) and GIG ( 1 , 1 ) -which are themselves defined by means of the genus term CARRIAGE  . In our example , the procedure stops at B~alxl GIG because these lexical i ~-~ s are no where in the ~ Cti~used as ~ terms  . It results in an , rti~l APPROACHESTOTHES AURUSPRODUCTION 229 taxom headed by the item VI~IICLE :
LEVELI : V ~ ICLE(x , I)
LaV ~ Z : ~( x , llZ13)
G~(x,IIZI?)
LEVEL 3:"" ~ BROUGH ~ M(x,X)
Going up the filiation path from the werd -sense VEHICLE  ( x , I ) a ae finds as syntactic head the proform SO~ING- there is no genus term  . Even if one is prepared to consider S ( MEI~ING as the genus term ( relaxing the HIS identity condition )   , the thesauric link that is obtained does not y ield more information than the semantic odes associated with the relevant definition  . 
A clear advantage of ~ nsler's procedure over intuitive thesaurus-production  ( as exemplified in LOLIK ) is that it can lead to an i ~ provement of the d ictionary database that is used as source  . To take only one example : suppose that one is convinced that there should be a the smn-icl in k  ( hyponym-superordinate ) between V\]~ICI ~ and ~ . If ~ is used as source database for thesaurus -production  , the link in question will not be retr i eved  ( INSTRIMENT is not used as genus term in the LDOCE definition of VEHICLE  ( x ,  1))  , which in evitabl ~- ~ aises the question of whether or not to revise the definition of VEHICLE  . 
IIII~I % OITING ~ DEFINITIONS applied to the ~ definitions  , Amsler's technique reveals an interesting consequence of a controlled defining vocabulary : the thesauric hierarchies are more shallow in ~ than in MPO  ( which does not feature a controlled defining vocabulary  )  . To give an example , ~ defines LIMOUSINE by memos of the genus term

Level one : VI~ICI ~
Levelt wo : AUTCHOBILE
Level three : ' SEDAN
Level four : LIMOUSIN ?: . . . . . . s . ed . .a~_ SEDAN is not available as genus term in LDO ( ~ because it is not in the defining vocabulary . LIMOUSINE , defined by means of the genus term CAR , is level 3 , not 4 in LDOCF :
Levelone : VEHICLE
Level two : CAR
Level three : LIMOUSINE : .   .   .   .   .   . car The shallow hierarchies based on LDOCE definitions are no doubtless revealing for the purpose of thesauri corganisation  . But the use of a controlled defining vecabulary makes it easier to process dictionary definitions in terms of both : I  ) auto~mtizing enusterm selection and disambiguation and  2  ) parsing whole definition strings ( as opposed to I ) This is because the lexicon that the parser must have access to can be determined in advance  . It is NOT open-ended ( open-ended means , practically , as extensive as the defined vecabulary , i . e . the whole list of dictionary entries-cf . Amsler 1980, p . TOg ) . 
Schematically , the decision to use a controlled vocabulary to write dictionary definitions can have three undesirable consequences : I  )   . -reduction of the amount of information conveyed by the definition : OVERUSE of i ~ licitly or explicitly partial definitions  ( in the sense of Bierwisch & Kiefer 1969 , p .  66-68 ) -the latter are incomplete definitions which wear  230 A . MICHIELS and J . NO eL their incompleteness on their sleeve , for em~ple:TARAN qIF~:spider of a certain kind  . 
2)  . -semantic overloading of all-purpose items such as GET  , HAVE ) MAKE , TAKE , etc . 
E . g . K  ~ P (1 ,  8 ) : to have for some time or for more time ( LDOCE , p ~605)3) . -uncontrolled increase in s > ntacticomplexity in the differentian on-genus part of the definition  ) : a ) degree of embedding-not only in clauses , but also-and perhaps more importantly-in complex nominal groups  ( cf . Amsler 1980, p . 108 on ANT-
EATING in the definition of AARDVARK ) b ) anaphoric relations c ) scope relations ( conjunction plays a pr~inent part here ) Compare the following two definitions of INSULIN i  )   . -OALDOCE ( Horn by 1980 ~-18 words substa ~ e ( a hormone ) prepared from the pancreas ~ of sheep used in the medical treatment of sufferers from diabetes ~  ( M = does not belong to the LDOCE defining vocabulary  )  . 
ii ) . -LDOCE- 37 words a substance produced naturally in the body which allows sugar to be used for ENEI~GY  , esp . such a substance taken frc~sheep to be given to sufferers from a disease  ( DIABE TES ) which makes them lack this substance . 
(ENI~GY and DIABETES in capital letters because not in LDOCE defining vocabulary  )  . 
This third consequence stems from the avoidance of non-defining vocabulary items by means of P~E  , which displaces the burden towards syntactic elaboration  , a point cogently made in Ralph 1980 ( p .  117) . 
This " grammaticalization " of much of the information conveyed by LDOCE dictionary definitions points to the need to analyse whole definition strings rather than just the genus terms  ( see the process of ANNOTATING dictionary definitions in No~l et al  1981  )  . 
Before we consider how to tackle the problem of disambiguating definition strings  , we must examine a much easier way of retrieving at least some thesauri clinks from the LDOCE dictionary file  . The LDOCE lexicographers sometimes provide ready made thesauri clinks : I  )  . -cross-reference to an item belonging to the defining vocabulary : CAPTAIN  ( 2 , ~(): to be captain of ; c ~; synonyms 2) . -cross-reference to a non-defining vocabulary item : ABBEY  ( x ,  1) :  .   .   .   .   .   . ; MONASTERY or CONVEM fsynonyms 3) . -cross-reference to a non-defining vocabulary item inside an LDOCE definition  , with a paraphrase in the defining vocabulary . An exa~leisto be found in the LDOCE definition of INSULIN quoted above : disease  ( DIABE TES ) which .   .   .   . 
~ n ~ genusterm , $ supererdinate
In Nojl et al . 1981 and ~ lichiels et al .   1981 we have shown the power of the IDOCE grmmnatical codes to disambiguate items in context  , more specifically in the context provided by the definition strings themselves  . For instance , in the LDOCE definition ~~( ~ , DAPPROACHESTOTHES AURUSPRODUCTION 231 -a wicked person who leads ~__ plet . o__dg . _wf . ong or harms those who are kind to him the annotating process will select the  V3 code for LEADS , because it occurs in the syntactic enviror rnent NP+TO+VP  ( NP = poople , VP = do wrong ) defined by V3 . This assigrBnent enables the system to reject all the word senses for LEAD in LDOCE except the appropriate one  ( one out of nine ; cf . entry L~I page 622) . 
We would like here to put forward a further possible exploitation of the LDOCE grammatical codes for the purpose of dissmbiguating dictionary definitions  . It applies to genus terms and consists in the selection of a preferred word sense for the genus term on the basis of a similarity in grarmnatical code between definiens and genus term  . Let us turn back to our fourth example , the entry LOOKON (2 ,  ~) . The first genus term is CONSIDP ~ R . LOOKON is assigned the granmmtical cede X9 . The second definition of CONSIDER is assigned the X  ( to be )  1 , 7 code . The similarity in grammatical code X serves as criterion to disambiguate CONSIDER in the definition of LOOKON as CONSIDER  ( x )  2 )  . 
The LDOCE semantic and subject codes can be exploited in a similar way  . It can be hypothesized that the combined use of all the formalized information types in LDOCE will prove to have a high disambiguating power and turn out to be a useful tool for the setting up of thesauric classes  . 
A last point that we wish to touch on concerns the nature of the genus terms in a dictionary data base which makes use of a controlled defining vocabulary  . The grmmnaticalization of information due to paraphrase in LDOCE gives rise to a special distribution of genus terms along a FULL WORD PROFORM gradient  .

ANY THING cf . LDOCE def . of VEHICLE(x , I)


As compared with MPD , for example , LDOCE genus terms tend to cluster toward the prof of ~ end of the gradient  . When the point is reached where the genus term does not provide more specific information than the semantic codes assigned to the definiend un  , two conclusions can be drawn : 1) . -the lexicographers of the source c~ictionary must consider whether their definition is appropriate  , as it does not show the thesauri clinks perspicuously  ;  2)  . -the whole definition string must be processed and disambiguated  , so as to retrieve the information that a dictionary which does not use a controlled defining vocabulary would have included in the genus term  . 
At the same time , the analysis of whole definition strings will reveal a number of thesauri clinks  ( such as that between INSTR\[lqENT and ACTION discussed in Miqhiels et al  1980  ) that the study of genus terms , limited to the HYPONYM-~/PERORDINATE relation , is unable to retrieve .
