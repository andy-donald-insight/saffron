The corresponderlce between a string of a language and its abstract representation  , usually a ( decorated ) tree , is not Straightforward . I lowever , it is desirable to maintain it , for Example to build structured editors for texts wr  1 ttEl/in naturn 1 Ianguage . AS such ccr ' resp ) ndences must be compos1 tion a\] , we ca\]I ~ hem " Structured Strmg--lree Correspondences "  ( SSTC )  . 
We ~ jrgue that a SST Cism fact composed of two mter related correspondences  , one between nodes and substrings , and the other between subttees and substrings , the substrings being possibly discontinuous in both cases  . We then proceed to show how to define a SSTC witl ~ a Structura ! Correspondence Static Grammar  ( SCSG )  , and ~ qich constraints to put on the rules of the 
SCSG to get a " natural " SSTC.

Ordered trees , annotated with simple labels or COmplex ' ce cora ~ ions "  ( property lists )   , are widely used for representing natural language  ( NL ) utterances . This o Er respon Os to a hierarchical view : the utterance is decomposed into groups and subgroups  . When the depth of lmguiscic analys~s is suc ~ that a representation m terms of graphs  , networks or sets of formulas would l ) emore Jirect , one of tensti\]I prefers to use tree structures  , at the price of encoding the desired in form a : : ion in the decorations  ( eg . , by " oo indexing " two or more nodes ) . This is because trees are conceptual \] y and a\] gorithmical \] yeas ~ ertomanipu\]ate  , and also because all usua \] interpretations based on the linguistic structure are more or less " composition a \]" in nature  . 
If a language is described by a classical Phrase Structure Grammar  , or by a ( projective ) Dependency Grammar , the tree structure " contains " the associated s tring in some easily defined sense  . \] n particular , the surface order of tile string is derived from some ordered  traverse1 of the tree ( left--to-right order of the leaves of a constituent tree  , or infix order ' foe a dependency tree ) . 
However , if one wants to associate " natural " structures to strings  , for examole abstract trees for programs or predicate-argument structures for NL utterances  , this is no longer true . Elements of the string may have beenerased , or duplicated , some " discontinuous " groups may have been put together  , and the surface order may not be reflected in the tree  ( e . g . , for'e normalized representation ) . Such correspondences must be compositional : the complete tree corresponds to the complete str ing  , the esubtrees correspond to suP strings , etc . Hence , we call them " Structured String-tree Correspondences "  ( SSTC )  . 
For some applications , like classical ( batch ) Machine Translation ( MT )  , it is not necessary to Keep the correspondence explicit : ' For revising a translat ion  , it is enough to show the correspondence between two sentences or two paragraphs  . 14 owever , if one wants to build structured editors fo r texts written tn natural language  , thereby using at the same time a string ( the text ) and a tree ( its representation )   , it seems necessary to represent explicit l y the associated SSTC  . 
In the first part , we briefly review the types of string-t ree correspondences whloh are implied by the most usual types of tree representations of NL utterances  . We argue that a SSTC should in fact be composed of two interrelated correspondences  , one between nodes and substrings , and the other between subtrees and substrings , the substrings being possibly discontinousm both cases  . This is presented in more detail in the second part  . \] n the last part , we show how to define a SSTC with a Structural Correspondence Static Grammar  ( SCSG )  , and which constraints to put on the rules of the
SCSG to get a " natural " SSTC.
\[ . ~CRR~N ~ .   . E ,_j ~ TWEENASTRIN~1 . p ~ F ~ E ~ TRUCTURETREES ( C-STRUCTURESI Classical Phrase Structure trees give rise to a very simple Kind of SSTC  . To each string w = al .   .   . an , let us associate the set of interva \] sij , O ~ i ~ j ~ n . w(ij denotes the substring ai .   .   . a 3 of w if i < o , 6 otherwise . 
The root , or equt va\]ently the M\]o \] etree , corresponds to w = wl0n ) . Each \] ear corresponds to some substring w ( ij )   , of length 0 or 1 ( we may extend this to any lengtmif terminals are allowed to be themselves Strings Then  , the correspondence is such that any internal node of the tree  , or equivalently each tree " complete " m breadth and depth  , CO rrespondStOw(i . j ) , iff its m daughters ( or ' its mimmediate subtrees )  , in order ' , correspond to a sequence wiL_jl ) ,   .   .   .   , w(imgm\] , such that i1 = i , jm = j , and jk = ik * l for O < k < m . 
This type of correspondence is " prooect we " It has however Peer \] argued that classical phrase structure trees are maa equate for " charaoter is ing syntactic representations in genera \]  , especially in the ease of so-oat \] ed " discontinuous " constttuents  . Here are some examples .

According tO ( McOawley 82) , sentence ( 1 ) contains a verb phrase " talked about politi cs "  , wlnich is divided by the adverbial phrase " of course "  , which modifies the #~ ole sentence , end not only the verbal kernel ( or the verbal phrase , in ChomsKy's terminology ) . Sentence (2) contains the particle " up " , wh to hls separated from its verb " picKed " by " the ball "  , In sentence (3) , the discontinuous negation " ne . .  , pas " overlaps with the composed form of the verb " ai  .   .   . donn ~" . Moreover , i a sentence in active voicels to be represented in a standard order  ( subject verb object complement )  , this sentence contains two displaced elements , namely the object " le " and the complement " lu i "  . 
(McCawley 82 ) and later ( Bunt & al 87 have argued that " meaningful " representations of sentences  ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) should be the following phrase structure trees  , (4) and (5) , respectively .

Figure 2: Example of discontinuity and displacement here  , the correspondence is establiehed between a node  ( or equivalently the completes uD tree rooted at a node  ) and a sequence of intervals . If a displacement arises , ee in (3) , the left-to-right order of nodes in the tree may be incompatible with the order of the corresponding sequences of intervals in the st rtng  ( the considered ordering is the natural lexioographic extension  )  . 
Rather than to introduce the awkward notion of " discontinuous " tree  , as above , with intersecting branches , we suggest to keep the tree diagrams in the lr usual form and to show the string separately  . For sentence (3) , then , we get the following diagram .

Figure 3: Separation of a string and its " dlsoontlnou8" 
PS tree
NOw , as before , the root of the tree still corresponds to w = w ( 0_n\] , and a leaf corresponds to an interval of length Oor  1   ( or more , see above ) . But an internal node with m daughters corresponds to a sequence of intervals  , ~ hich'is the " union " of them sequences corresponding to 
Its daughters.
More precisely , a " sequence " of Intervals is all st of the form S = wil_jl  )   .   .   .   .   . wlip_jp , in order ( Ik < Ik+1 for O < K < p ) and without overlapping ( jk < ik+1 for O < k < p )  . Its union ( denoted by "+" ) with an interval I = w ( ij is the smallest list containing all elements of S and of I  . For example , S+I is : S itself , if there is a k such that ik < t and j_<jk ; S , augmented with wiiJ inserted in the proper place  , if j < i lorj p < i or there is a k < p such that Jk < i and j < iK *  1   ; are q and r such that J q < t ~ lq + l and tr ~ j ~ j r  ( other cases are analogous )  ,  2 . DEPENDENCY TREES ( F ~ S ~ RUCTUR ~ ) In classical dependency trees , elements of the represented string appear on the nodes of the tree  , with no auxiliary symbols , excepta " dummy node " , often indicated by "=" , which serves to separate the left daughters from the right daughters  . 
There are two aspects in the correspondence . First , a node corresponds to an element of the str ing  , usually an interval of length 1 . Second , the complete subtree rooted at a node corresponds to the tnterval union of the intervals corresponding tO the node and to Its subtree  . 
These intervals may not overlap.
The string can be produced from the tree by an tnorder traversal  ( one starts from the root , and , at any node , one traverses ftrst the trees rooted at the left daughters  , then the node , then the trees rooted at the right daughters , reeursively ) . 
Sentences ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) might be represented by trees ( 8 ) and ( 9 ) below .

There may be some discussion on the structures produced  . For example , some linguists would rather " see " politi cs " dominating " about "  . This tSnotour " tOpiC here , but wew tll use this other possibility in a later diagram  . For the moment , note that discontinuity does not always disappear in dependency trees  . Here is an example corresponding to sentence (3) .

Figure 5: Example of a " dt soont tnous " dependency tree Let us now take a simple example from the area of programming languages  , ~? nioh$he ~ an abstract tree associated to an assignment  , ~ here some elements of the string are " missing " in the tree  , and where a node o or reep onds to a " discontinuous " substring  ( a sequence of intervals )   .

Figure 6: Example of " abstract " tree for a formal language expression Here  , we have shown the correspondence between nodes and sequences  . The parentheses are mlsstng in the tree , wt qich means that the sequence corresponding to the subtree rooted at node "+" is more than the union of the sequences oor respondfng to its subtrees  . However , there is no overlapping between sequences corresponding to independent nodes or suP trees  . 
A noeher remark is that the elements appearing on the nodes are not always identical with elements of the represented string  . FOr example , we have replaced ":=" by "= . " ~ nd the ( discontinuous ) substring " if then else " by " if thE . melse ", in a usual fashion . 
3 . P_RED OATE-ARGUMENT TREES ( P-STRUCTURES ) In " predicate-argument structures " , it is usual to construct a unique node for a compound predicate  , in the same ~ ; pirit as the " if_then_else " operator above , With sentences (1) and (2) , for example , we could get trees (12) and (13) below . Beside the logical relation ( argument place ) or the semantic relation , the nodes must also contain some other information  , like tense , person , etc ,   , ~ hich is not shojn here .

Figure 8: Examples of p-etructures for al a2 vbl b2 cl c2 On certain nodes , we have represented the sequence corresponding to the complete  8ubtree rooted at the node , fel\]o wed by the sequence Corresponding to the node itself  . For nodes A , B , C in tree (14) , this " local "8 equano ets empty . 
In both trees , tt i8 clear that the sequence al V blol corresponds to an " incomplete " subtree  , namely V(A(al ) , B ( bl ) , C(cl )) In (14) and V(al , bl , cl ) in (15) . 
In tree (14) , the cOOrdination is shoal directly on the graph  , and the verb ( V ) is not shown as elided . \] t is a matter of further analysis to accept or not the distributive Interpretation  ( " respectively " may hold between the three groups  , the last two ones , or nones ) . 
On the contrary , tree (15) , in a sense , is a more " abstract " representation . It shows directly the interpretation as a coordination of two sentences  , and " restores " the elided V . 
4, MULTILE VELTREES ( M-STRUCTURES)
Multilevel tree structures , or m-structures for short , have been introduced by B . VA UQ UO IS in 19 . //4  ( see ( Vaupuols */8 ) ) fo r the purposes of Machine Translation . On the same graph , three " levels of interpretation " are described  ( constituents , syntactic dependencies , logical and semantic relations ) . AS seen in other examples above , the nodes ~? nich refer directly to the st ring do not contatn elements of the string  , but rather representatives of ( sequences of ) elements of the string , called " lexical units " ( LU ) , like " repair " for " reparation " , plus some information about the derivation used . 
The graph is deduced by simple rules from a dependency tree : each tnternat node  t8 " lowered " tn the "'" position and its syntactic function becomes " GOV "  ( for " governor " , or head in some other terminology ) , discontinuous lexical elements ( like " ne . .  . pas " or " al .   .   . denn ~" are represented by one node , coordination ts represented by " vertical lt s ts " as tn tree  ( 14 )  , lextoal units of referred element ~ are put In the nodes corresponding to the pronouns  , an approximation of coln dexlng , etc .   . 
From the point of view of the associated correspondence between representation trees and represented  8trtngs   , nothing new has to be mentioned . 
II . A PROPOSAL : STRUCTUREDSTRING-TREE CORRESPONDENCES 
Our proposal Is now almost complete.
I . DEFINITIONS a ) The correspOndence between a string and its representation treets made of two interrela ted correspondences : between nodes and  ( possibly discontinuous ) 8 ubstrings ; between ( possibly Incomplete ) subtrees and ( possibly dtsconttnous ) substrlngs . 
glb ) It can be encoded on the tree by attaching to each node N two sequences of intervals  , called SNODE(N ) and
SIREE(N ), such that : 1 . SNODE(N)~STREE(N) , v~ich means that SNODE ( N ) 18" contained " tmSTREE ( N ) with respect to tts basic elements ( the w ( ij )   , that is , that StREE(N ) = STREE(N)gSNODE(N ) . Note that equality cannot be required , even on the leaves , because the string " ( b ) " may well have a representation tree with the uniquene deb  . 
2. if N hasm daughters Nt . . . Nm , then
STREE(N ) ~ STREE(N1)+ . . . + STREE(Nm ) + SNODE(N) . \] n case of strict containment , the difference correspond to the elements of the string which are represented by the subtree but which are not explicitly represented  , like " ( l ' and ") " in " ( b ) " . 
c ) The sequence SSUBT(X , N ) corresponding to a given m complete subtree X rooted at node N of the whole tree T is defined recursively by:  SSUB1  ( X , N ): STREE(X ) if X : N , that is , if ? iS reduced to one node , not necessarily a leaf of T ; SSUBT(X , N ) = SSUBT(XI )* . .I+SSUBT(XD ) U SNODE(N ) . if N , the root of X , has p subtrees XI . . . X Din T . 
In other words , one takes the smallest sequence contaming the bi9gest sequence corresponding to the leaves of x ( S\]REE on the leaves ) and compatible with the monotony rules above . 
Here are some interesting properties of SSTCs which may help to classify them  . 
ASSTCiS ~ if
STREE ( NI ) and STREE ( N2 ) have an empty intersection If
N1 and N2 are independent;
SNODE ( N1 ) and STREE ( N2 ) have an empty intersection if
N2 is a daughter of NI.
ASST Cise B_~~et a ~_t & ~ if it is non overlapping ; for any two sister nodes N1 and N2 , N1 to the left of N2 , STREE(N1) is completely to the left of STREE(N2) . 
This means that , if STREE(N1) = w(il_jl ,   .   . w(ip_jp ) or and STREE(N2) = w(kl_ll .   .   . w(kqlq or ~, then jp~kl . 
ASST Cisirg_LE ~\[ if . for each elementary interval w(i_i-1) , there is a node N such that
SNODE(N ) = wii+1).
ASST Cisg QEP_Lg_C ~ if each elementary interval Is contained in SNODE  ( N ) for some node N . 
ASSTC is of the g~if SNODE ( N ) is empty for each nonterminal node N . 
3. ~_R ~ PRE~SNTATION
In the examples above , we have encoded the correspondence in the tree . However , this is in practice not always necessary , or even practical . 
in the case of explicit and projective SSTCs , for instance , the string can De obtained directly from the tree  , and there is no need to show the intervals , Note that , in the process of generating a string from a tree  , one naturally starts from the top , not knowing the final length of the string , and goes down recurs \] rely , dividing this interv ~ a \] into smaller intervals  . Rather than to introduce variables representing the extremities of the created intervals  , it may be more practical to start from a fixed interval  , say0_1 or 0 lO0 . Yhen . the Positions between the elements of
G 2 the string will be denoted by a mincreasing sequence of rational numbers  ( 0 ,  1/3 ,  1/2 ,  5/?) , etc . 
In the case of " local " non-projectivtty , we have tried some devices using two relative integers  ( POS , LEV ) associated with each node N . POS ( N ) st ~ ws the relative order in the subtree rooted at mother  ( N )  , if LEV(N ) = O , or more generally at tts LEV ( N?I ) ancestor , if t . EV(N)>O . 
Unfortunately , all these schemes seem to work only for part icular situations  . 
Also , if the SSTC is overlapping , or ' not complete ,  1 ( may be computationally costly fo find the ( sma\]lest ) subtree associated with a given ( possib\]y discontinuous ) substrtng . But this operation would be essential in a " structural " editor of NL texts  . A possibility is then to encode the correspondence both in the tree and in the string  . 
Finally , take the example of tree (15) above . Suppose that the user of a NL editor wants to cl lange bl  ( Paul , in the corresponding NL example ) in a wayv ~ Hch may contradict some agreement constraint between al  , v , blandel . One should be able to ftmd the smallest SSIC containing al and other elements  , that is , the subtr'ee V(al , bl , cl ) and the discontinuous substring alvbl cl ( the notation a .   . v . b .   . c .   , might be suitable , if one wants to avoid indices ) .

The static grammars of ( Vauquols & Chappuy 85 ) are devices to define string-tree correspondences  . They have been formalized by the STCGs of ( Zahartn 86 )  . 
Here , a contextfreeltke apparatus of rules ( also called " boards " , for " planches " in French , because they are usually written with two ~ dtmenslonal tree diagrah ~ s  ) is used to construct the set of " legal " S SYCs . 
The axioms are all pairs ( X , Y ($ F )) , where X is an unbounded string variable , Y a starting node ( standing for SENTENCE , or TITLE , for example ) , and SF is an unbounded forest variable . 
The terminals are all pairs ( x , x ') , where x is an element of a strtng and x ' a one -node treev Z~ich represents it  . 
The rules chowhow a SSTC t8 made up of smaller ' ones . 
\] he generated language ts the set of all var iable-free  ( < strlng > , < tree > ) pairs derivable from an axiom by the grammar rules  . 
In order to avoid undue formalism , let us give an example for the formal language ( an bncnIn > O )  .

Actually , the formalism is a bit more precise and powerful , because it is posslb\]e to express that a correspondence in the r  . h . s .

But something has to be added to distinguish the STREE and SNODE parts  . 
We simply associate to each constant or " variab le appearing in a STCG rule one or two expressions represeming the STREE and SNODE sequences  , separated by a "/" if necessary , with basic elements of the form " p_q " ,  ~ . ~ here p and q are constant or " variab\]emdtces .

The STREEC or respondences are not properly def in ed  , because one should be able to distinguish between different permutations of the Interva ls  , which is clearly , 3 impossible with our previous definit ions and representations of SSTCs  . 
This is because the order of the elements of the strings is not compatible in the l  . h . s , and in ther . h . s . : our first constraint will be to forbid this in 
STCG rules.
Our second constraint will be to forbid the use of auxiliary variables which do not correspond to substrlngs  ( subtrees ) of tmeterminal ( variable-free ) pairs produced by the STCG . 
Let us illustrate this witl ~ the following STCG  , which constructs the representation tree S(A(u ) , B(v )) for each word w on(a , b , e ) of even length such that w = uv and

If we try to put sequence expressions on the P nodes and string elements  , we notice that it would be necessary to extend the intervals of w  , rather than to divide them , Otherwise , we would make the first P of a DoPPP correspond to the second b of w = abcbac  , which is quite natural , but what would we associate to the first P of bBcPPP ?\] f were present explicitly  ( and separately ) the structure of a given ( < string > , < tree > ) element of the SSTC by its derivation tree in the STCG  , the second constraint will allow us to instantiate all variables by substrings or subtrees of < string > and < tree >  , wtthout having to construct other auxiliary strings and trees  . 
This , of course , ' would permit a mope economical ~ mplementation , in terms of space . 
Finally , note that the interesting properties of SSTCs mentioned in Ill  . labove have simple expressions as constraints on the rules of our extended STCG formalism  . 
CONCLUDIN 6 R ~ MARK ~
Trees have been widely used for the representation of naturatlanguage utterances  . However , there have been arguments saying that they are not adequate for representing the socalled ' discontinuous'structures  . 
This has led to various solutions , relying , for instance , on encoding the desired information in the nodes ( e . g . 
'eoindexin9") , or onoe fining trees with " discontinuous " const ituents  . 
We have presented here a proposal for representing discontinuous constituents  , and , more generally , nonprojective and uncomplete SSTCs with overlapping  . 
The proposal uses the ordinary definition of ordered trees  . This is made possible by separating the representation tree from the surface utterance  ( which the tree is a representation of )  . The correspondence between the two may be represented explicitly by means cf sequences of intervals attached to the nodes  . 
This opens Upa discussion on ( and definitions of ) structured string-tree correspondences in general  . Thls representation might also be used in syntactic editors for programs or In syntact ~ co -semantt ceditors for NL texts  . 

Finally , the formalism of the String-Tree Correspondence 6rammar has been extended to glve the means of representing the said structured correspondences  . 
An analogous problem is to define structured correspondences between representation trees  , for lnstanoe between source and target interface structures in transfer-based MT systems  . We do not yet know of any satisfactory proposal . 
A solution to this problem would give two very
Interesting results : - first , a way to specify structural transfers in a reasoned manner  , just as STCGs are used to specify structural analysers or generators  , second , a way to put a text and its translation in a very finegrained correspondence  . This is quite easy with word-for-word approaches , of course , and also for approaches using classical ( projective ) PS trees or dependency trees , but has become quttedifficult with more sophisticated approaches using p-structures or m -structures  .
