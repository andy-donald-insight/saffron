We present the results of the work carried out over several years by the Memo data Company on the slructure of the French lexicon  . This work has been accomplished thanks to a first research contract with the Ministry of Research and Technology and today has lead to a dictionary of more than  100   000 words and phrases grouped analogically and syr ~ymo~y  . 
If we understand quite well how a dictiol mry like this can be used with ease by humans  , we set the problem of the identification of meaning by a computer  . We will evaluate how Dicologique adds information eomplentaty to the information contained in semantic nets  . Thanks to a somewhat unusual cons ~ on method and the systematic classification of words according to their meaning  , we are progressing to a continuou system of localisalion of the meaning itself  . On the map we created , it is possible to compute the meaning due to lexical semantics for any sentence written in natural language  . . . 
1) ~ rt ~ , , om or ~ xX a C_AL

The purpose of dictionaries grouped under the name " analogical " is always the ease of the passage from a word to an idea and the inverse passage from an idea to a word  . This aim is reached by the make up of lists of stereotyped associations and of semantic fidds  . The first a Rnoach does not have the same likelihood of ending with a satisfactory result as the second  . 
The stereotyped associations depend on the idea of time  , the background and the experience of each individual  . Their record can only be a track of the ~ ve memory from the individual  . 
On the other hand , the dictionary of semantic fields is perfectly workable at any time  ; it is based on the linguistic ~ x ~ aventic qrs that the language dictionaries have tried for ~ nturies to record and to normalize  . 
It is not possible , by definition , to consmact a dictionary made up of stereotyped ass~ations  , whereas it is possible to work on the complexity of hundreds and t  . housar ~ of linguistic facts which we have classified  . 
We will give a mathematical description of the dictionary of the semantic fields  . This approach is in parallel with concrete xamples derived from the database  .

In ~ the ~ me 9 types of sets :- fot ~ types of sets mrmd " lists "  . 
They give the quasi synonyms , i . e . lists of words which are equivalent in ~ and identical in grammar  . We have the following types of grammatical sets : noun  , verb , adjective , adverb . 
-the set mn - ~" dass "
A set of this type ? xmtains nouns which can be subsumed under the same concept  . 
In our example in figure (2) , " bateau " is a set containing on the one hand words which represent its ~ vahe  . s (" bateau ' , " navire " , " embarcalion " ) and catheocher " ~" of specific boats ~- the set mn ~" mlazd ~ xts " ~ y  , the contents and utilizations of this type of set are rather various  . We need it , for example , to ~ t the link between " baleinier " and " baleine  "13  , which is not shown in figure 2 so as not to weigh down the graph . 
-tbesetmrmd " tlxrne "
This set contains all the concepts and words associated in a particular semantic field  . It may also contain ~ sets such as " related words " or smaller " the t is "  . 
-the setmmed " des:ripfm "
It contains the constituents organically ~ to a ~ It is only used when absolutely necessary for a definition  . 
-the set nmmd "~"
It mabsumes words having the same outstanding feature  . For example , our set of class " bateau 16ger de  #che " could be found under a set characterized by the feature " small " which differenciates this class from other classes of boats  . 
As for the words , we have provided them with the usual characteristics  , i . e . their morphological classes ( grammar ) and their usage labels ( colloquial , archaic , literary . . . ) which contain the labekine : ~ le ACRES DE COLING-92  .

Moving through the dictionary from the general to the particular is a process widely put into practice by users who may either search a precise term to be discovered by intersection of associated concepts or intend to edit a lexical field or a classified list  . 
~ of a na ~_
The logic of the sets takes into accounthe logical " and "  , " or " and negation . Here are some examples of ~ arches which are always based on the intersection fsets edited by the function U  ( C j ) :- Search of a pnx fisemm Search of the name of the " coiffure du Pape  t4''  . 
The intersection of " Papel-s " ( theme of 162 words ) and " chapeau ~6" ( list of 180 words ) or " cour on nem ( theme of 33 words ) produces the Wol~ds "\[ Jal ~18" , " calott ~1 9" et ~ . in 10 seconds on the microeom puler . 
-Search of v~ds*o extmms aaklea

-Sea ~ of syrmyrmacemting ta actm~xt

This function permits , therefore , to move upward ( towards the root node ) in the structure of the sets . 
In figure (2) , the set " bateau del ~ he deplaisance " is defined by the set of sets h = bateau dep ~ zhe  , bateaudephisan ~ . 
A terminal word W . can belong to 1 to I sets Ci ( i going from 1 to I , I being the number of " parents " ( main sets ) of W , ) .

F ~ e4 : apart of ~ ean ~ O . t ~ leovh ~ rtnt of But the position of the computer is very different : if humans possess the structures necessary for interpreting the terms  , i . e . the linguistic heritage and the knowledge of the world  , the computer for its part possesses neither of them  . This is why we try to supply it with the lexical knowledge absolutely necessary in a coherent system  . 
Obviously this knowledge is situated in the inheritance from the " primitives " to the words  . 
Let's see an example in which the motion from the right to the left is applied to a problem of automatic indexing in information retrieval  . 
2.3 Anan ~ a6m to ~ Jt ~ m ~ i ~ rnrlt ' val
We want the system to retrieve the lexieal key elements of the following small piece of text : " The accident  , on Friday , took place in foggy weather . The two ears that cms bed into each other caused a pile up of about  50 vehicles on the congested national dual carriage way  . "
Strategy for resolution :
The strictly lexical analysis of this short passage w in be based on the calculation of the surface corms lxmding to each cx meep t  ( set ) covering one or more words of this document : the more abstract a concept  , he bigger its an ' face . 
For e ~ set q we ~ a errea ~ earar ' ~ M ( Q ) and i ~ a ~ in com 0 adsm wi ~ ~ ~ fimia ' ver ~ ci , q3 , with Ci as ai ximiti ~ wd considering a specifie tms~f~a~gen~~o ~ utar  .

Nqes : 1 ) Each ~ amCel ~ possesses hevaluations of its surface accounting for its hseries of connections  . 
2 ) In reality A ( C j ) takes into account a complementary pieoe of information : the semantic characteristics of sets  . A set of the type " list " introduces a more stretched arc than a set of the types " theme " or " related words "  . 
3 ) If Dioologique is a general dictionary capable of resolving problems of information retrieval referring to general anguage  , it is very easy to adjust it to a precise problem  ( for example , the thesaurus of a Slxcific undertaking ) . One only has to stretch t~daarcsituated on the passage of the series of conneclions of each term of the thesaurus  . 
The surfaces S , which are situated in a normm fere nee , describe a map of meaning on which all the continuous calculations of Euclidiange on ~ try are made possible  . 
To resolve our problem , it is possible to keep the mathematical expressions very simple : a simple Each word of the document is recognized in the dictionary as it activates all the sects containing it according to their specific weights S  ( Q ) which depend on their series of ? x~r~x fions . 
Finally , each set will have been activated k times .

To put it simply , all of the 100000 words and ctaxent phrases , the 15000 typified sets have been created manually and are continually worked over again  , thanks to a structuring tool specially developed for this purpose  . 
The 35 0 0 0 0 ob ~ , waliom of direct connections of words , the 4   000   000 series of inh~tanee which we run currently are , proportional to our efforts , daily and of better quality . 
The point at issue in this iterative procedure is , of course , to ~ appear in Dicologique tendencies toward sets of " primitives " in the linguistic sense  . 
The number and articulation of these primitives should be both sufficient and necessary to define the objects depending on them  . 
Our will is to continue working on the ~ of the lexicon  , as to the quantity of vocabulary represented of course  , but principally with to the quality of the ~ of the lexicon  . 
Moreover , we have been developing basic such as the Semiographe for information retrieval which allow us to evaluate the progression of the quality of interpretations weol Xain  . If we hope to find partners during COLING 92 who want to join us in onr current research projects  , we are also very interested in meeting people from foreign universities and firms who would like to launch a version of Dicologique in another language  .
