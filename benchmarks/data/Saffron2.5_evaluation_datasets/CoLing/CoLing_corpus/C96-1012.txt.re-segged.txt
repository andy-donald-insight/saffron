1 Introduction
Word sense disambiguation is a crucial task in many kinds of natural anguage I  ) rot : essing at ) l ) li-cations , such as word selection in iI la ( ; hine translation ( Sato ,  1991) , pruning of syntactic structures in parsing ( l , ytinen , 1986; Nagao , 11994) an ( ltext retrieval ( Krovets and Croft , 1992; Voorht ' . es , 1993) . Various researches on word sense disamil ) ignation have recently been utilized in ( : orlms-based apt ) roache . s , reflecting the growth in the numlmr of machine readable texts  .

Corpus-/)asedm ( ; thotls are . classified into two ap-1 ) rt ) aches : examI ) le-I ) ased approaches ( Kurohashi and Nagao , 1994; Urmnoto ,  1994 ) and statistic-based apl ) roa ( : hes ( l ~ rown et al , 1991; 1) tLglm and Itai , 1!)94; Niwa and Nitta , 11994; Schiitze , 1992; Ym'owsky ,  1995) . We follow the examt ) h > based apl ) roach illexl ) laining its effe . etivity for verb sense disamibiguation iJapanese . 
A representative example-based method for verb sense disambiguation was proposed by Kurohashi and Nagao  ( Kurohashi'sinethod )   ( Kurohashir and Nagao ,  1994) . Their method uses an 0 , xamph ; database , containing examples of collocations as in figure 1  . Figure 1 shows a fragment of timentry associated witt l the Japan  (  ; severb to ' ru . As with most words , the ve , rbto'r "? t has multi-piesenses , examples of whit:hare " to take/steal , "" to attain , "" to subst'ril)e " and " to reserve , " The database gives one or more case frame ( s ) associated with tilt ' , verbs for each of their senses . In . Japanese , a cout I ) lelnt ; ntOfa verb , which is a constituent of the case frame of the verb  , consists of a nonii phrase ( case filler ) followed by a case marker such msga ( nominative ) or o ( accusative )  . 
The database has~m example set of case fillers for each case  . As shown in figure 1, examples of a comi ) lement c . an be considered as an extensional description of the selectional restriction on it  . 
The task (: onside . red in this paper is % o interpret " a verb in an inputs  ( ' . n t cnt : e , i . e . to choose ( ) lit ) sense from a set of candidate senses of the verb . Given an input sentence , Kuro-hashi's method interprets the verb in the input by computing semantic similarity between the input and exaln ples  . For this computation , Kuro hashi's nmthod experime Iltally uses the Ja , panese word thesaurus Bunruigoihyo ( National-Language R ( > search Institute ,  1964) . As with I nost thesauruses , the length of the 1lath between two words in Bun-r'uigoihyoisexl ) e , eted tt ) reflect the similarity be , -tween them . Figure 2 il hlstrates a fragment of B ' unruigoihyo in ( : hlding some of the nouns in figure 1 . I , etustake the example sentence (1) .

Assut'h , the sense of rot ' u , in (1) can be interpreted as " to reserve .

Figure 2: A fragment of Bunruigoihyo accusative to verb sense disambiguation is greater than that of the nominative with the case of verb ~ t  ( - ) ru .  1' 2 . These leetional restriction of a certain case is stronger than those of others  . For example , in tile accusative , the selectional restriction of " to subscribe " is stronger than that of " to take/steal " which Mlows various kinds of objects as its case filler  . 
In this p~tt)er , we improve on Kuro hashi's method by introducing a formalization of these notions  , and report the result of a comparative experiment .

Property 1 in section 1 is exemplified by the input sentence ( 2 )  . 
(2) shach 5 gash ? kanshiotoru.
( presideut-NOM ) ( magazine-ACe ) (?)
The nominative , shachd("company president ") , in ( 2 ) is found in the % o attai If ' ease frame of torn and there is no other cooccurrence in any other sense of toru  ; therefore , the nominative supports an interpretation " to attain  . " On the other hand , ? nominative accusative Figure 3: The semantic ranges of the nominative and accusative with verb to rn the accusative  ,   , sh , gtkanshi (" magazine ") , is most similar to the examples included illtile accusative of the " to subscribe " and therefore the accusative supports another interpretation " to snt  ) scribe . " Although tile most plausible interpretation here is actually the latter  , Kuro hashi's method would choose tile former since  ( a ) the degree in which the nominatives ut ) ports " to attain " happe . ns to be stronger than the degree in which the accusatiw ' ~ supports " to subscribe  , " and ( b ) their method always relies equally on the similarity in the nominative and the accusative  . I to we ver , in the case of torn , since the semantic range of nouns collocating with the verb in the nominative does not seem to have a strong delinearization i a semantic sense  , it would be difficult , or even risky , to properly interpret the verb sense based on tile similarity in the nominative  . In contrast , since the ranges are diverse in the accusative , it would lmf e . asible . 
to rely more strongly on the similarity in the accusative  . This argument can be illustrated as in figure 3 , in which the symbols "1" and "2" denote example case fillers of different case fraines respectively  , and an input sentence includes two case fillers denoted by " x " and " y  . " The figure shows the distribution of example case filler stie-noted by those symbols in a semantic space  , where the semantic similarity between two case fillers is represented by the physical distance between two symbols  . In the nominative , since " x " ha . ptmns to be estimated to belong to the range of "2"s all , hough " x " a e (' . ually belongs to both sets of " l " sa . nd " 2" s . Ill the accusative , however , " y " would he prol ) erly estimated to belong to " l " s due . to ( ; tie mutu Mind et ) en ( lence of the two ac ( : usative case filler sets , even though examples ( lid not fully ( : overe~tch of the ranges of " t " s and "2" s .

( 52 sibility of interpreting the input verb as sense 3  , and SIM(nc ,  $~ , c ) is the degree of the similarity between the input complement nc and example complements $ s  , c . ws is the weight on an interpretation 3 such that more obligatory cases imposed by s being found in tile input  , will lead to a greater value of the weight a . 
P (3) = w3ESIM(nc,Ss,c ) (1) c
SIM(nc ,  ?3 , c ) is the maximum degree of similarity between nc and each of  ?3  , e as in equation (2) . 
SIM ( , c ,  & , e ) = max sim ( , + c , (2) ec ~8 , cIn our method , on the other hand , for the reason indicated in section 1 , we introduce two new factors : ? contribution of case to verb sense disambigna-lion  ( CCD )  , ? relative strength of selectional restriction ( RSSR )  . 
First , in regard to CCD , we compute the plausibility of an interpretation by the weighted average of the degree of similarity for each case as in equation  ( a )  , replacing equation (1) . 
P (3) = w3E cg3,e)"CCD(c)
EcCUD(c ) (3)
Here , CCD(c ) is a newly introduced weight , such that CCD ( c ) is greater when the degree of case e's contribution is higher  . 
Second , in regard to RSSR , the stronger the selectional restriction on a case of a case frame is  , the less plausible all input complement satisfies that restriction as mentioned in section  1  . Note here that tile plausibility of an interpretation of an input verb can be regarded as the plausibility that the input complements satisfy the selectional restriction associated with that interpretation  . This leads us to replace SIM(nc , Es , c ) in equation (3) with PSS(nc , ? s , c ) , which denotes the plausibility that the case filler nc satisfies the selectional restriction described by the example case fillers ~ S  , C . 
P (3) = w3E cPSS('nc,g3,c ) ? CCD(c)
EcCCD(c ) (4)
From the assumption that PSS(nc , Es , c ) should be greater for a larger SIM(ne , ?s , c ) and lesser relative strength of the selectional restriction described by ? s  , c , we can derive equation (5) . 
PSS(nc , ? s , c ) = SIM(nc , Ss , c)-RSSR (3 , c ) Here , RSSR (3 , c ) denotes the relative strength of tile selectional restriction on a case c associated with a sense  3  . 
3 For more detail , see Kuro hashi's paper ( Kurohashi and Nagao ,  1994) . 
4 Computation of CCD and RSSR
The degree of contribution of case to verb sense disambiguation  ( CCD ) is computed in the following way . The degree of contribution of a case should be high if the semantic range of the example case fillers in that case is diverse in the case frame  ( see figure 3 )  . Let a certain verb have n senses ( sl , 32, .   .   .   , s  ~ ) and the set of example case fillers of a case c associated with  3~ be $3~  , c . Then , the degree of c's contribution to disambiguation , CCD(c ) , is expected to be higher if the example case filler sets ? si  , cIi = 1 ,   .   .   . , nshareless elements . This can be realized by equation (6) . 
CCD () = 1I & . d + I&j , l-n&j , li = 1j = i + t ( 6 ) a is the constant for parameterizing to what extent CCD influences verb sense disambiguation  . 
When a is larger , CCD more strongly influences the system's output . Considering the data sparseness problem , we do not distinguish two nonns X and Y in equation  ( 6 ) if X and Y are similar enough , as in equation (7) . 
X + Y = X if 3 im(X , Y ) >= 9(7)
Relative strength of selectional restriction ( RSSR ) is computed in the following way . Tile selectional restriction on a ease of a case frame is expected to be strong if the example case fillers of tile case are similar to each  ( ) tiler . Given a set of example case filler sill a case associated with a verb sense  , the strength of the selectional restriction on that case  ( SSR ) can be estimated by averaging the similarity between any combination of two elements of that set  . Thus , given a set Es , cof example case fillers in a case c associated with a verb senses  , tile SSR of cassociated with sCall be estimated by equation  ( 8 )  , where ? ~ , c is a ni4h element of ?3 , c , and m is the number of elements in ? s , c , i . e . m =\[$3, c\[ . 
E = IEj = + + ,
SSR(s , c ) = , + C2 if m > 1 maximum otherwise ( 8 ) In the case m = 1 , that is , the case has only one example case filler , tile SSR becomes max in mm , because the selectional constraint associated with the case is highest  ( following table 1 , we assign 11 as the maximum to SSR ) . The relative strength of selectional restriction ( RSSR ) of a case associated with a verb sense is estimated by the ratio of tile SSR of tile case to the summation of the SSRs of each case associated with the verb sense  , as in ssR ( .   ,   , 0  ( 9 ) a Evahmtion Our experiment compared the performance of the following methods :  1  . tOlro hashi's method : equation (1) 2 . our method ( considering CCD ): equation (3) 3 . our method ( considering /) oth CCD and
RSSR ): equation (4)
In method 2 and 3, the influence of CCD , i . e . ( ~ in equation (6), was extremely large . We will show the relation between the w ~ riation of c ~ and tile performance of the system later in this section  . 
The training/test data used in tile ext ) eriment contained over one thousand simple Japanese sentences collected from slews articles  . The examples given by IPAL were also used as training datas  . 
!) , ach of tile sentences in the training/test data used in our experiment consisted of one or more complement  ( s ) followed by one of the ten verbs enumerated in table  2  . For each of the ten verbs , we conducted six fold crossvalidation ; that is , we divided the training/test data into six equal parts  , and conducted six trials in each of which a different one of the six parts was used as test data and the rest was used as training data  . We shall call the former the " test set " and the latter the " training set  , " in each (: as e . 
When in ore than one interpretation of an input verb is assigned the highest t  ) lausibility score , any of the above methods will ( ; hoose as its out t ) ut the one that appears most frequently in the training data  . Therefore , tile applicability in each method is 100% , given that the applicability is tile ratio of the number of the cases where the system Rives only one intert  ) retation , to the numt ) er of inputs . 
Thus , intileext ) eriment , we compared the precision of each method , which is in our case equal to the ratio of the nuin ber of correct outputs  , to tilen ulnt ) erofint ) uts . 
Since tile 1 ) erformance of any corpus-based method depends on the size of training data  , we tirst investigated how the precision of each method was improved as the training data increased  . In this , we initially used only the examples given by IPAL  , and progressively increased the size of the training data used  , by considering an extra part of the training set ( five parts of the total six data portions used ) at each iteration , until finally taking all fivel ) arts in the training of our system . 
4Note that . , in equation (5) , while SIM is an integer , PlSSI/ . ranges in its value h'om0 to 1 . Therefore , II , SSI , is influential only when several verb senses take the same value of SIM for a given ease  . 
' ~ The number of examples given by IPAL was , on ~ verage ,  :1 . 7 for each ease of each case frame . 
The results are shown in figure 5 , in which the x-axis denotes the ratio of the data used froln the training set  , to tile total size of the training set .

Second , tile consideration of CCD , i . e . contribution of case . to verb sense disambiguation , improved on Kuro hashi's method regardless of tile size of training data  . ( liven the whole training set , the precision improved from 75 . 2% to 82 . 4% (7 . 2% gain ) . Third , the introduction of the notion of RSSR did not fl trther improve on the inethod using only CCD  . 
Table 2 show stile performance for each verb on using the whole training set  . The column of " lower bound " denote stile precision gained in a naive method such that the system always choose stile interpretation most frequently al  ) pearing in the training data ( Gale et al ,  1992) . Tile column of " two highest CCD " gives the two highest CCD values from the cases for each verb  , which are calculated using whole training set . 
Finally , let us see to what extent we should al-.
low CCD to influence verb sense disambiguation.
Figure 6 shows the performance with the parametric constant ~ in equation  ( 6 ) set to w ~ rious values . c ~= (/ corresponds with Kuro hashi's method , in which CCD is never considered . As shown in figure 6 , the stronger influence we allow CCD to have , the better performance we gain . 
6 Conclusion
In this paper , we proposed as lew example-based method for verb sense  ( tisambiguation , which lin-t ) roved the performance of the existing method by considering the degree of contribution of case to verb sense disambigu ~ tion  . 
The performance of our method significantly depends on the method of assigning degree of similarity to at  ) air of case fillers . Since Bunr'i ~ it loi-hyou is fundamentally based on human intuition  , it does not reflect the similarity between a pair of case fillers computationaly  .

Figure 6: The relation between the degree of CCD and 1  ) recision of word clustering ( Tokunaga et al ,  1995 , etc . ) can 1 ) oten tially be used ill conjunction with our method to overcome this human reliance  . 
In our current implenmntation , we consider the collocation between case fillers and verbs  , but ignore the combination of case fillers . Instead of a database as in figure 1 , we could store a set of com-binations of example case fillers  , e . g . the combination of s~wi ( " pick pocket " ) and saifu ( " wallet " )  , but not that of suriando toko (" man ") . Itow-ever , this way of data storage would require the collection of a much larger number of examples than the current method  . This issue needs to be fl ~ rther investigated .
