The paper is the first report on the experimental MT system developed as part of the Japanese -Russian Automatictra  . aslation Project ( JaRAP) . The system follows the transfer approach to MT . Limited so far to lexico-morphologieal processing  , it is seen as a foundation for more ambitious linguistic research  . 
The system is implemented on IBM PC , MSDOS , in Arity Prolog ( analysis and transfer ) and Turbo
Pascal ( synthesis).
1 Theoretical background
The development of the Jall . AP experimental system was preceded by a long period of purely theoretic research into various aspects of natural language ~' tdits functioning in translatio ~ t  ( see , e . g . , ( Shalyaplna ~ lO80a , 1980b , 1988)) . Some of the basic principles which have evolved from this research may be summarized ~ m follows  . 
(1 ) The most adequate scheme for simulating human translation ~ ctl vity is doubtless the transfer one  . 
(2 ) The level of transfer and the volume of structural and semantic information explicitly represented at this level should be determined experimentally as a compromise between the demands for translation adequacy under the given conditions and the advantages of " shortcuts " permitted by the superficial correspondences between the languages concerned  . 
(3 ) Semantics is not in itself a level of linguistic representation  , but rather part of linguistic description at any level of representation flinguistic units  . 
(4) In its semantic aspects , syntax is dependent on lexicon to a greater extent hanvice versa  . 
(5 ) A model aimed at faithful simulation of linguistic performance should make explicit use of the factor of linguistic normativity  , this being , at least in prospect ~ a building block for " self-tuning " functions as an analogue for human learning capabilities  . 
An approach best suited for effectuating these principle seeirm to be that of relying on a lexicon-oriented lingware framework of a special kind  . 
Within this framework , eTt trles of a uI fiform structure may be provided , besides lexlcal units , also for morphological categories , fanctlon elements ( in chd-lug punctuation ) , and all kinds of grammatical features , while syntagmatics of all levels may be presented in terms of valencies of those levels  , assigned to the corresponding lexical or grasmn . at lca \] units in their entries . 
The JaFtAP experimental system is mea at to incorporate this approach  . 
In ~ cordance with the transfer scheme of translation  , the system is made up of three major components : the Japanese analysis component  , the Japanesc-Rl~ssian transfer component , and the Russian synthesis ( generation ) component . It is implemented on IBM PC , MSDOS , its programming tools being Arity Prolog for analysis and traamfer ~ and 
Turbo Pascal for synthesis.
2 The current version of the
JaRAP system
At present , the JaRAP system does not go far beyond the i ~fitia lexico-morphological level of text processing  ( though some provision has already been made for further stages of its development-see See  . 3) . 
The analysis component of the system performs so farthree main groups of operations : segmentation of the input Japanese texts into graphico-morphological  ( CAM- ) elements ( stems a Jtd suffixes of Japanese words )  ; processings \] tran Mationally idiomatic ( TI- ) csm 6 in a tisns of GM-elements ; and lezieo-rnsr pholofical ( LM-) analy~i . ? of the resulting sequence of ( \] M-elements a at d the_J rTLeombl nations . 
Segmentation is accomplished in two steps.
First , the input text ( = the input sequence of k~na and kanjl kodes ) is broken up into fragments by con-teztual delimiter seert Mn to denote word or morph boundaries  ( e . g . , punctuation marks , the occurrence of a k~tat~na symbol after a hlragana one or vice ver B % etc  , ) . Then the fragmgnts obtained are segmented into GM -elements by mea~ts of dictionary  1/2 search . The resulting GM-elements are represented by the reference numbers loc~tlng their dictionary entries in the database used  . For segmentatim tally ambiguous fragments , all possible segmentations are formed . If dictionary search is unsuccessful , the program draw so a ant auxiliary index of separate graphic symbols  , so that " unknown " words can still be processed ( nard if they axe composed of " kaat jl , be even provided later on with a traats latlon of sorts  )  . 
The processing of TI combinations of GM-dements is partly necessitated by the fact that fragment boundaa'ies may sometimes epszate the components of a  . e or n pot tnd word ~ llke so that these compoitents have then to be joined together by a special procedure  . The saane procedure is used to locate multl-word combla at lo its similar to tin-gle GM-elements in that they have idioms  . tictrans-latlons ~ nd do not allow of variations in their htter-nal structure  ( this is often he case with terminological expressions  )  . TI-combint ~ tlonsaxe searched for as sequences of reference numbers identifying the GM-elements they ~ e composed of  . When . found , they are replaced each by a single reference number-thu  . t of the entry for the TI-combinatlon as a whole ,  ~ . nd are subsequently treated in the suma cway as individual GM-elements  ( with some reservations mentioned in See . 3) . 
LM-analysls of a sequence of GM-elements examines  , foreaz h of them , all of its alterna . tivelxico-morphological interpretations , or LM-elements con-tanned in its entry , with the aim of integnging the LM-elements corresponding to adjacent GM-elements into accept a  . ble morpholog tlcsl ( M - ) representations of Japnmese word forms . The acceptzd fillty of these is established by checldng each M-represent a-tion  , assom tas it is formed , for the co-occurrmt cerestrk :- tions its elements may impose on eax : hother t ~ n doft the elements of its immediate oit textual neighbours  . Tlf is also serves for disaznbiguation , as all the LM-elements that cannot be used to form a  . nacceptable M-represent ~ r tion fa word form in the given sequence of GM-elements  , are filtered out . 
To optimize processing where aiterna . tive pa . ths of analysis are concerited , all analysis procedure , a . reorga . nlzed so as to lhn its ep ~ r ~ tte processing of such alternatives only to the subpath t  ; responsible for the ditferences between them . If some subp , ~ this the same in two or more of the alternative axtalyses  , it i ~ processed just once , and the result is used for all the corresponding Mteraatives  . 
The bulk of the morphologle aldeserlpt lonsed in LM-analysis is of a valeney-~ased type  ( an excep-tio a being the morphonologica \]- or , r ~ ther ~ morpho-graphical-alternations : t . he 10 metarnles representing such altentations are in corpor ~ Lted in the segmentation procedure  )  . The morphological valencies are mostly assigned to suffixes  , while stems ( verbal or axLjecfival ) ~ tas fillers . The cooccurrence rstrictions imposed by the eh ' . ments of ~ word-for raon those of its adjax : ent wordforms are described in much  . the same way ( the only difference bei \] tg that irt this ca~e the data  . to be checked is assigned to stems at least ~ L8 often as to sufi'ixes )  . This helps to mt ~ ke word-bonn da . riestra-nspa . rent , if necessa-ry , to morphological valencies , so that the borderline between morphology a . nd syntax loses something of its tradlt lona \] r ~ghtity  .

Sometimes this involves skipping a . uumber of intermediate lements , such as a . uxilia . rles , brackets , etc . 
Besides lexieo-morphological transfer , we ha . reby now implemented some very simple synts . cfieala . n~ysis-and-trv . ns fer opers . tions based on the most general correspondences betwem t Japanese and Run-sian structura  . l and word-order information .

The information database used in the analysis and transfer procedures is organi ~  , ed as an indexed llst of dictlon ~ ryentries for individual GM-elements  , TI-comblnations of GM-elernents , and grammatical features ( (: lasses ) of LM-elements . To speedup ( lle-dex organized as a superposition of b ~ lanced trees  . 
Ewch entry ( presented in the database by ~ Prolog term ) constitutes a list of entry zones confine de ~ ch to one type of linguistic information  . A sep-axatez one ( identified by the corresponding label ) is used to specify , e . g . , the graphical representation of the GM-element described  , its structural ( lexico-morphological ) representation ; the llst of its grammatical maxkers ; each type of restrictions imposed on the elements filling its morphological w  , deneles , etc . The overall set of entry zones is the same for all types of entries  , thoughe ~ chentry cont ~ ns only the zones relevant othe element described  . 
At present , the d~tabase includes over two thousand entries . 
Special emphasis has been placed upon providing the system with e~cient means of updating linguistic information  . The environment built for this purpose is called VOC OPS  ( " VO Cabulary updating OP-tionS " )  . 
The VOCOPS environment allows the user to add , delete or replace all types of dlction ~ ryentries or zones within them in a highly interactive mode  . 
VOCOPS checks the updating information for its for -real accuracy and for its compatibility with the information already contained in the current databa  . se . 
It then proceeds to wax n the user of those consequence ~ of lds updating operations which otherwise might have been overlooked  , and to indicate the in ~ cur ~ ies or inconsistencies detected  . If possible , it also suggests the likely ways of their correction  . Among other things , VOCOPS keeps watch on the correspondence btween the entries for individual GM-  ( and LM- ) elements ~ d those for their TI-combinatlons . E . g . , if the user wishes to delete a GM-element which forms pazt of some of the TI-combinations present in the database  , VOCOPS lists these with a warning that they will also be deleted  . 
The Russian synthesis component is co~l-strutted as an independent subsystem  , cornplete with a database of its own . Its functions include both morphological generation and some tmpect a of syntactic processing  . Here we will not discuss it an any length , because there is ~ sepaxate paper devoted entirely to this component  ( Kanovich , ShaJyapintr , 199 . 1) . 
3 Development work under way
Implementing the most basic ( however simple ) of the linguistic functions needed in translatior h the current version of the Jal't AP system constitutes the necessary foundation for further developments  . Both its database and its programming software are structured to a ~ cept any new components  ( new zones of ) impairing ~ . hose ~ I ready functioning . .'\]:he VOCOPS updating subsystem is also general enough to be e ~- ilytuned up to new types of linguistic d~t ~ as soon as they are included in the system  . 
Moreover , even in its present form , the JM ~ . AP system comprise some specific features mea~tt for more adwnced lingulstic processing  . 
Thus , aznong the grammatical markers assigned to the Japanese LM-elements in the current database axe u number of those to be used in syntactical nal -ysis  . 
Entries for TI-comblnations of GM-elements include specification of their syntactically ~ d semantically dominant components  , for use in processing paxallel constructions and a ~ taphor ~  . 
The list of the Russian equivalents for an LM -element includes  , wherever desirable , different parts of speech , the choice between them to be effected by the syntactical tra~tsfer  . 
The synthesis component is designed to ~ cept syntactic '  , dly weighted representations of Russian word forms , etc , Now that we have built the ba . qic ground work , labor-consuming as it is , we are taking up these , more ambitious tasks . 
As the Japanese-Russ lanp a ~ r of languages i virtually unexplored in its machine-tra~tslation perspective  , our immediate off'errs are being focussed on determining the reasonable minimum of grazmnatical knowledge of Japanese necessary for obtaining intelligible Russian output for unadapted  ( us-pro-edited ) 
Japanese input.
