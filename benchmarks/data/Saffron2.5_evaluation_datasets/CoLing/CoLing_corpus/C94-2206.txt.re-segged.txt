Korean Lexieal Transducer , 'Pwolevel Morphology , 
Morphotaeties , Ordered ll , ules 1 Introduction This paper presents an incremental construction method of a lexieal t ransducer  ( LT ) for Korean . 
A lexical transducer , lirst described by Karttunen , Kaplan , and Zaencn ( KKZ ) ( Karttunen , 1992a ) , is a speeialized tinite state transducer ( FST ) that maps canonical citation forms of words and morphological categories to infh  . 'cted surface forms , and vice versa . 
l;\]'s have many advantages for stemming , morphological analysis , and generation . They are ( i ) bl directlonah the same structure ( : an be used for stemming and generation . 
( ii ) etticient : the recognition and generation of word tbrms does not require the application of any morphological rules at runtime  . 
LTs for li ' , nglish and French have been built at Xerox PARC within a tame work now nast wo-level In or pho logy  ( Koskenniemi ,  1983) . As described by KKZ ( Karttuneu , 1992a ) , this can be done in three steps : ( i ) we construct a simple flnite-state automaton ( LA ) that defines all valid lexical tbrms ( LFs ) of the language . . A I , Fisae on cateuation of stems and morphemes in their canonical dictionary representation  .   ( ii ) We describe morphological alternations by means of two-lew  ,  . 1 rules ( Koskeuniemi ,  1983 ; Kin't-1'\['hisp ~ per was partially supporl ; edbyt ( or can Science and h\]ngine cringl , 'onndation . 
tunen ,  1993) , compile the rules to finite-state transducers , and intersect hem to form a single rule transducer  ( RSF )  .   ( iii ) We merge the LA with the ffF by composition producing the  1/\[' that has on its lexical side every valid lexical form of the language and on the surface side the corresponding realization as determined by the morphological alternations of the language  . 
KKZ argued that for l !' rench , it , was best to divide step ( ii ) into two stages . A three-level description was required to give a linguistically satisfactory account of the plural lbrmation of e ompomld nouns  . KKZ opted for two cascading two-level rule systems thai  ; are corn-piled separately , then intersected laterally and finally composed to a single RT  . 
The task of building a morphological analyzer for ~t language such as Korean or  , I apanese is a much higher challenge than it is for l '  ; uglish and French . AKo-re . an verb may have more than fifty thousand inflected forms  . = The Korean writing system ( l \] an aul ) does not consistently distinguish be . tween single and eom-pound nouns . Because llanguluses syllabic characters , changes in syllables trucl , ure are directly reflected in the . orthography . 
Because o\[' the complexity of the morphological alternations in Korean  , it ; is very difficult , although not impossible in principle , to describe them in a single two-level rule system or in a system that is limited to just three levels like the KKZ system for French  . The most natural description of the Korean alternation is a cascade of rules of greater depth  .

3 Construction of a Korean
Lexical rI~-ansducer ( LT )
The first , st(q ) in the coustruet ; ion of a lexie M trans-due er is to create a simple linite--state automaton for all wdidk '  . xical tbrms of Korean . The lexical aul , oma-ton(I , A ) is eomllosed wit ; hl , he first set of rule transducers ( R ; I') . The result ; ing transducer has on its " Ul/per " side ,   , he valid lexical forms , and on the " lower " si(le , in term 0 . ( tiatere presenl ; aJ , ions derived fly the lirst set C ' rules . This inl ; ermediate transducer is composed with , he second set of rule trmls ducers and timin'o tessisiter a  , ed severall ; imes . At each stage ill tit(!process , the lexica I si(le remains unchanged and the iut , erme(liatere\[)resenl , atious are changed by the new set C'rules . The \[ ilml result is a transducer timas so clare's the valid lexic~d forms with their proper surface realizations  . Concel ) tually this is similar to what hap .

3 . 1 Construction of Lexical Automa-ton ( L h ) The ifsm-utility enabled us to assemble the LA incrementally  . The first step was to divide the total list of morphemes into snb bons on the basis of their morphological type and to make a text file for each sublexie on  . We added diacritic markers to the edges of certain types of morphemes in order to be able to enforce morphot actie constraints on valid morpheme sequences  . 
Each sub lexicon was compiled separately to a finite-state automaton  . The sub lexicons were used to construct the LA with the help of the regular expression facility in the if sm-toolkit  . .For example , having compiled a simple automaton from the list of sm@lenouns  , we could expand it to an infinite lexicon of compound nouns with the regular expression " noun  . auto "\[#" noun . auto"l*'\]'his regular expression reads the noun automaton from a file and concatenates it with itself any number of times and marks the internal word boundaries with #  . 
The first version of the LA was made in this way by combining sublexicons with regular operations  ( concatenation , union , iteration ) . 
In order to enforce morphotactic constraints on the concatenation of some classes of sn flixes  , we wrote a set of two-level rules that require or prohibi the occur-fence of particular diacritics at certain suffix boundaries  . Lexieal forms that do not satisfy the morphotactic constraints get eliminated in the composition with the wellformedness rules  . The diacritics themselves are realized as zero so that they are not present in the lower side of the resulting transducer  . The final form of the lexical automaton is obtained by extracting the lower-side from that transducer as a simple automaton  . 
We believe that this incremental method of lexicon construction is better suited to morphologically complex languages than the lexicon format commonly used in two-level morphology  . In standard two-level lexicons , individual entries contain int brmation about which sublexic on they may concatenate with  . The entire lexical structure is compiled in one step to large letter tree  ( Karttunen , 1993; Antworth ,  1990) . Our method is more tractable in two ways . Firstly , the lexicon can be developed and refined stepwise  . Secondly , the morphotactic rules of the language are described explicitly as the regular expressions that construct the LA in conjunction with the wellformedness constraints that eliminate certain types of concatenations  . In two-level lexicons of the standard variety , the morphotactic structure of the language is not described explicitly at  ; all . l  ~ , ather , it is expressed in a very opaque and indirect way  , in the sequences of links between entries and snblexicons  . 
Sproat argued thai ; two-level morphology of morphotactics leads to a somewhat in elegant model of long-distance dependencies and suggested the unfica-lion scheme  , due to Bear , as a solution ( Sproat ,  1992) . 
But unification scheme introduces additional runtime overhead  . The above approach can easily and explicitly describe the fact that " - able " attaches to verbs formed with the prefix " en -" and does not require additional runtime overhead  . 
We give a few examples of the difficulties in the description of Korean morphol  ; artics . There are two different types of endings : ( i ) non-t in M ( verbal ) endings for tense , modality , subject honorific or aspect , and ( it ) final ( verbal ) endings as cornplementizer , nomi-nalizer and adjectivizer . The non-tinal endings are placed in fl ' ont of final endings and must be followed by a suflix of the second type  . 
(4 ) shows the ordering restrictions of non-finM endings  . The parentheses indicate optionality . 
(4.)(+ lion ) (4-t'~st4-Perf (4- Will)
I ( + Past )   ( + Will )   ( 4-Beta'o ) )  ( Hon : Honorific ; \] ~ etro:Iei ~ rospection ; 
Perf : Perfect Aspect )   ( 4 ) compiles to a lexicon covering 20 difi > rent compound nonfinal ending sequenees including null  . ' l'h is representation is clearly more informative than a simple listing of the members of the class  . The proM-bition of " Past+Perf+Will+l . etro " in ( 4 ) cannot be described by an adjacency table . 
In ( 4 ) we do not need any morphotactic diacritics on the left  , because all nonfinal endings can combine with any verb and adjective stems arm the combination of nonfinal and final endings is controlled by the diacritics of the latter group  . 
(5 ) shows three entries in the suh lexiron of final endings  . Tim elements in square brackets are morphotactic diacritics  . ( Square brackets indicate grouping , the vertical barmarks a disjunction . ) ' Phe diacritics are deleted by wellformedness rules when the final endings are combined with other morphemes  . The diacritics on the left of nun and nuu-ka shows that they cannot combine with adjectives  .

4 Conclusion
The success of our work on Korean further underscores the point made by KKZ  ( Karttnncn , 1992a ) thai ; the most salient property of two-level morphology is not the number of levels but the fact two -level rules describe regula relations  ( just like classical phonological rewriternles )   ( Kaplan , 1988; Ritehie ,  1992) . Consequently , it is possible to combine sets of parallel two -level rules by intersection and merge them with the lexicon and other rule systems in a cascade  , of compositions . The complexities of Korean morphology make it desirable both t br linguistic and computational reasons to allow for many more intermediate l vels than assumed in previous works on English and t  , ~reneh , l . e-gardless of the nnmber of intervening levels , the outcome is a single lexieal transduce . r thaw directly maps lexical forms to their intlected surface realizations  , and vice versa . 
In the construction of the lexieal automaton for Ko-  . 
rean , we have put two-level rules to a novel use as wellformedness constraints on lexical tbrms  . The sublex-icons from which the LA is constructed contain  ( tia-critic marks on the outer edge that identify the type of morphoh  ) gical constituents that the lexicon contains . 
The role of rules in the \[ , A constructions i to enforce morphotaetics and , at the same time , to eliminate the diacritics that encode them . 
Theoretically , we can get the same LT to compose the morphotactic and phonological > ties all together into one  . rule and compose it with the initial LA or to compose the initial LA with each rule of them or photaetic and phonological rules one by one in order  . 
Practically , the composition of all the morphotactic and phonologieal rules into one rule causes the combinatorial explosion of states  . This shows that ordered rules can be used to avoid the combinatorial explosion of states in one two level rule system too  .
