cessiug of coherence.
We must emphasiz ( : tirst that coherence in natmral language disc ( )urses may result from incoherent parts : a t ) arLo\['a discern:stmay1 ) ccontradictory with what is said in other parts without questiou--ing the coh  (  .

So , a " lapse of memory " el ) cr-ates often in text coml ) rehension arid\[ ) rote cl , s the text \[' reindee \]) incoherence . This means , of course , that coherence in natural language discourses is quite d if fecent from tim consistency in a matw  , -matit : altheory , which has Lo be consistent in each o\['its sets of i  ) rol ) ositions . So , a cohcr ( mce theory for natural language representation systenls must take into account this fact and limit the c  ( )herence vcril ication to parts of texts actually asserted  . 
At a de (' q ) level at least , we pose the hypothesis that a text is generally coherent  . So the llrob-\]era we address to is to try to detect incoherence  . Though the incoherence of a text may result from a lot of phenomena  , were stri ( -tourselves in this communication to incoherence stemming from negal  , ions . But surface negations must lie inter .

Tim framework of the rllo(h' . lislinguistic pragmatics : w c want to represent helinguistic marks of  1  ) ragmaties ( and not the pragmatics of ailal ) l ) lieation )  . Thus , the knowledge associated to a discourse is represented at two levels : a knowledge representation of the npplication do--main  ( which is outside Lirallatura I languag ( ! systom ) and the model we are concerned wit\]l here , and which is the ( h' . c:t)(' . st level of our natured language analysis ( the pragmatic level )  . These con-strain Lscxt ) lainwily the existing knowledge rel ) re- .

2 . 2 Outline of there i ) resentation mo ( h ~ l The knowledger c pres (  ; ntation rno(h ' . \] is an object ()\[ IC , expross ( . ~dill a particular logic for ntal is rn . 
The underlying logic is that of M'\]SNII' ; WSKI's logical systems\[Lesniowski ,  \] 989\] , \[ Midvi Ih; ,  1984\] , \[ILouault ,  \[991\] . In those systems , the primitivt's of a nohj et . l , model correspond to the " is a " of l ; \]w (3aleulus of Names and t ; heingredient\['unctoro1"the . Mereology\[Achou /) and Rouault , 198!)\] . We have thus a h)gic ; d basis for the primitives of most object models and a framework for the  . inductive part of the system . 
1 139 ' l'he individuals of the knowledge base are objects  . This base is divided into worlds . A world is a structured set of objects which is coherent : the exceptions  , change of meanings are taken into account by a change of world  . A world is divided into two universes : its intension and its extension  . The intension contains those objects whose representation is supposed valid for speakers and situations related to discourse nunciation ait d to the application dolnain : there exists a consensus between the speakers of the discom:se about these objects  , which reflects " general " background knowledge ( 77 ~ edog is a stupid and spite J ) Uanimal )  , The intensional objects are then kinds of " logical " concepts in their world  . The extension of a world contains objects which are particular to a specific situation  , a specific time ,   . . . ( Peter's dog barked all night long ) . There is inheritance from intension to extension of the same world  , but the extensions of two different worlds do not communicate  . In case of change of world , a complex inheritance procedure must transmit only knowledge which insures the coherence of the new world from the  . old intension to the new one ( This , also stressest it ( ; necessity to be able to detect incoherence in a discourse  )  . 
There are three kinds of objects in the model ( and hence in any world and universe ) : the individual objects , the action schemata\[Gallo and Rouault , 1992\] and the state schemata . 
2.3 The individual objects
In our model , art individual object has the following structure :\[ Rouault  ,  1992\]




Detinitional part



Functive 2.3.1 Status
This partimticate the conditions of validity of an object  . It be composed of several objects : World A discourse cart generate worlds  . For each object , the system must specify in what world it must be introduced  , where it is valid and where we can make inferences that bring it into play  . We therefore pose:
MeWorld(I )
I is t it (', name of the described object . " world " is the formative functor of name , the variable M is the value of the world that the discourse created  . 
When the knowledge coming from the discourse is incoherent with the knowledge base  , there is world change . This change can come equally from a difference of viewpoints between spe  . akers expressed in the discourse \[ Fredj ,  :1992\] . 
Universes An universe denotes to a couple ( I , I ) formed of an intension ( I ) and an extension ( 1 , ) . 
The object is defined in the world by a formative % nctor of name  , from I\[Berrendonner and
Renault , 1991\].

Individual and ( ' lass An object can be an individual or a class . This distinction is based on the singular \ [ plural opposition  . The individuality is defined by a forlnative fimctor of name  , from l :
In ? ind ~ v(I ) in takes the value Ind or CI2 . 3 . 2 Definit , ional part of an object Here , we discovered two kind of sub-objects : those which are part of the described object and those which relate the object descl : ibeda  . nd others objects of the world . The name of a nob . iect represents the sub-object of the denomination . 
Ncde'aomin , al , ion(\[)
We also call associate to a name of an object other synonyms  . These sub-objects arc defined by the formative flmetor of nalne whose the argument is the name of object  . 
Nigother-names ( I)
Structural sub-objects represent heparto\[' ingredience  , " part-all " , in the sens of " the mere-elegy . It means tl tatit describe . s the . relation between an object and its constitive parts  . They are of the form:
Iein ~ ir (, U
Object I is a part of objecl , J . i . e . The ' wheel is a parl of the bike . 
Functive . It indicates a relation between the object considered and another object  . This relation is marked on the surface by a verb or normalised verbal form\[Berrendonner and al  ,  1992\] . A func-tive has the following form : f(s; , J ) Where I is the object described and J is the object with which i is connected by the functiv c f  2  . 4 Predicative obje (' . ts The functives of an individual object act as relations between objects  . We have to pose the properties of such relations : depending on if they refer to an action or a state  , a relation is defined by an action schema or a state schema  . An action schema contains the following sub -objects \[ Gallo and Renault  , 1992\]: the name(s ) of the action , l ; ually entailed by the action ( result , pro(uct ,   . . . ) and the scenario associated to the i ) rocess , whi('it depends on the discourse < lo , min . 
2 . 5 S t ructur ing o f the knowledge base In the intensional universe of a world  , the in ( li-viduals ( also named types ) are nodes of a lattice ( the lattice o1" types )  , the hierarchy l ) eing rep-resent e . d by t ; heing redient ( fun(to t . The types are also linked by their stru ( ' tura \] and fun ( tiresub = ol < jects . Of course , the extensional objects arc , lm k e ( \[ also /> y their structural and functives sub-obje ( : ts . And each such object is in accord with its un <lerlying tyl > e  . 
3 Negations in the object-based knowledge representation model  3  . 1Negations and objects '\]'\] maim of them o(l ( ; list or ot ) resent dynamically the knowledge associated with a  ( list ( mrs ( at a given point ( time ) of its progression . Thus , each object may ( ; hang ( during this progress : we must then ( listinguish betwe ( : n this " punctu & l " represenCation and the history of objects  ( whichig is necessary to maintain in the ( : as ( of a dialogue , for exaniple ) . We are concerned here only with the updating of a knowledge /  ) ase containing the knowledge valid for a discourse at a given time of its progression  . 
Un(ier ~ his restriction , the knowledge stored in the base is positive : when the discern : s  ( asserts a negatiw ~ , fact ( Do ( is arc not slupid ) , this prest tp-l ) OScs that the positive corresponding fiu : t ( Doq sarcs lupid ) has a h : e ~ dy been asserted ( exl ) licitly or implicitly ) nnd that a e o n l , radiction may arise . In a mono-sl ) eaker discourse ( text ) , the general sit-uation seems to be : tim assertion of a negative fact simply  ( : rases the positive one ( of course , this erasing is virtual when the positive fact is only l > resul  ) posed )  . In a multi-speaker discourse ( dialogue , for example , a negotiation is sell ( able to detide which of the two possibilit i es  ( the positive or the negative fact ) is to be in cht ( h ~ in the knowledge base . In all these cases , we have to be able to infer properties about objects from negative assertions  ; which in t t t r t t , need to re . present the formal properties o\["different kinds of negations operating on sub-objects of an object  . 
3.2 Negation on types
As indicate ( l ) reviously , only the intensional objects ( the types ) haw . ' a " h ) gical " behaviour : they represent gener M knowledge valid in the discourse  . 
The infer (' . n(:0~ rules about negations are valid only it , the intensional universe . We then have to define what are the types of negations involved in the type rel  ) resentation . 
3.2.1. Negation about the worht
The type is negated in the present worhlbut mq > posed valid elsewhere  . 
For the linguists , the negation is not a simple problem For tit ( : mathematical logiciau , a negation is a simple problem Starting from a wor hl where the negation is a  , simple problem ( which , \[ or example , is matheTnatieal logician ) , thc previous assertion entails tim opening of a new world  , in which the new fact is asserted ( 7' hencgation is uot a simple problem )  . When a discourse is expressed by mono-speaker , the assertion < ) fapositive fact ( then cgation is not a simple fact ) provoke a contradiction i the same world . This contradi <: tion can 1 ) ebased at least on the dill ' create betwec . nsub-objects of type : ' is ~,' is not ' . The solution seemingly substitutes a positive fact by a negative fa  . ctone . 
3 . 2  . 2 Negat ion about t im un iverse A fact preserLted as a type is negated as such and related to extensional objects  ( or the converse ) : 7' hc do q is not a stup id animal , but Fctcr's is . 
3 . 2  . 3 Negat ion about the card ina l i ty it is sitnply a change of v  ; J tteelftile , eardinality value . 
3 . 2  . 4 Negat ion about denominat ions Negation can focus on the " denominations " a  . nd " others-names " sub-objects , l ) en yi , ga " denomina-tion " or " other-nat ncs " , means to denying a property of the object . \[ n this (: a . se , a new prop(~rtyissld ) stit , ed to as . b-object .  \[' ; xamplc : the pcrsonal computer is uotan ' IBM ' , but a ' COPAM +' . Note , belbre , replacing an e . w property ~ theme ( hi must verify that the new property is really a , propertyoaly pc because there is a case : where a substitution makes no sense : the personal compaler is not an ' IBM'  , but a ' print(r " 3 . 2  . 5 Negat ion on s t rnctura l snb-ob jec ts Here it is the ingrc dien  ( : e relation whi ( : h is negated i . e . 
7' hewall is part of a housc . \[ nsome (: rises , the he:gallon of \[ Aising rIt \] suggests the ingredi  ( mcc of the object A to another type ( J , such that there exists a type 1 ) which is greater than 13 and ( 7 in the lattice of types : The spoke wheel is not a part of a ear  ( it Zs part of a bike ' )  . 
3 . 2  . 6 Negation on notional sub-obje ( - ts 7'he lcavcs arc green/The leaves arc not green'\[' he infer  ( nee possibilities from the negative assertion arc : of two kinds : - There is a finite opposition between the notion and its " lexical negation "  ( Blood is red/111 ood is not rcd = It is ( > fanothereolour )  . 
-There is a contimm m ( as in big/small ) and we cannot infer small from not big . 
3 . 2  . 7 Ne . gation on fun ( tire sub-objects As indicated previously , the uuin ber of a . ttested arguments of the predicate may change the interpretation of the negation : \]  . ' The cowdocs not cat ' is the negation of ' The  . cowcats'2 . ' The cow does not (' . at meat'is generally not the negation of the property ' The coweat smeat a mon~t something ' and  (  , he negation of the choice of meat as food . If erewestill refer to another type having with meat the sat negeneric class  ( food ) in the lattice of types . 
3. We have the same situation in:
The cow does no teat with a knife
The cow does not cat grass with a knifc
Thc cow does not eatmeat in Paris
In these examples , only the choice of the last argument seems to bc concerned by the negation  . 
3 . 3 Negat ion o f extens iona l ob jec ts A type underlies extensional objects : a change in the properties of a type entails the same change in the associated extensional objects  . Of course , the reverse is not true : an extension M object may have properties not possessed by the underlying type  . From this it re-salts that the only coherence for an extensional object is internal : it cannot have contradictory sub-objects  . 
Note that ~ n extensional object may be an individual or a  ( : lass ; of course , all the elements of the class must have the same properties  . \]nfact , class and individual always coexist . Therefore , it is legal to infer a class of type T when the discourse introduces art individual of type'\['  . This is obvious in ' It is one of the neighbour's dogs ' and also in ' lie does not have children  , only one ' . The last example shows that the negation of a property about a class may have two interpretation : the ordinary one  , in which the property is negated for t it (' , individual of the class attd the negation of the ( : lass itself ( or , conversely , of the individual ) to pose the property about an individual ( a ( : lass )  . 
lit the sentence : ' Only Peter came ' , we pose a property Mmttt Peter ; then ' only ' introduces the class and , of the same time , indicates that the class contains only Peter . This entails that t it (' , negation may focus on only ( negation that the class contains only one individnM  ) or on the property ( Pctercaste )  , then asserted about ' only Peter ' . 
Another interesting example is ' All students succeed':weasserta property about the class student and  , then , specify that the class is studious , that is : the property is valid for all individuals of the  ( : lass . in other words , that the class is the extensional projection of the type student : As in previous example  ,  ( , he negation can operate on all ( the class is not studious ) or ontire property asserted about , ~11 students . 
4 CONCLUSION
In this paper , we have presented an object-based knowledge representation model that allows to extract and to represent knowledge in the knowledge base from discourse  . This model can be used in the context of man -machine dialogue or for information retrieval  . 
We have posed the problem of coherence as regarding the knowledge represented in the knowledge base  , taking into account heap parent contradictions within discourse  . The incoherence can be result fi:omalot of phenomena but we restrict ourselves in this communication to incoherence stemming from negation  . All the cases treated ( among others ) show that a surface negation does not always fit a deep negation and  , in fact , seldom entails ~ n incoherence . Consequently , the negation cart have art effect in object-based knowledge representation model such as to update properties of objects but it rztrely provobe ~ n incoherence between the objects of discourse and the objects of knowledge base  ,
