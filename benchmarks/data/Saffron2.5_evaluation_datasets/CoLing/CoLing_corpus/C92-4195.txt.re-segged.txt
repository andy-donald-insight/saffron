A system for the automatic segmentation of German words into morphs was developed  . 
The main linguistic knowledge sources used by the system are a word syntax and a morph dictionary  . The syntax is written in the formalism of right linear regular grammars and comprises approximately  1  , 4 00 rules describing the set of those sequences of morph classes which underlie syntactically well formed words  . The morph dictionary contains almost 11 , 000 morphs . Each morph is assigned to up to 6 morph classes . -Statistical evaluations with 6000 test words showed that more than 99% of the segmented words got a correct segmentation . 
1 INTRODUCTION
IBM Scientific Center Heidelberg is developing a large vocabulary speech recognition system for German  ( Wothke et al 1989 )  . The system needs for each word of its reference vocabulary two types of reference patterns : ? prototypal acoustic reference patterns  . 
? phonetic transcriptions of the main pronunciation variants of the word  . 
Up to now the transcriptions were generated for each orthographic word of the reference vocabulary by an automatic procedure having two drawbacks which caused a high amount of manual revision for the generated transcriptions : ? For each " word only one transcription was generated  . Our speech recognition system , however , needs at least the most significant pronunciation variants of each word  . 
? The automatic procedure took into account only the letter context of each letter to determine its transcription  , in German , however , the transcription of a letter is very often also dependent on its morphological context  . -Most of the transcription errors of the former system were a consequence of the fact that the system did not have any intbrmation about tile morph structure of the words  . 
To reduce the manual work necessary to revise the transcriptions we currently develop a system with the following new features :  1  . An orthographic word is first segmented into its morphs  . 
2 . In a second step one or more phonetic transcriptions are produced for each segmentation of the word using letter-to-phone rules which can refer to the morph structure detected in the first step  . 
The following paragraphs will deal with the first step  . We will mainly restrict ourselves to the linguistic knowledge incorporated in our current morph segmentation system  . The overall architecture of the segmentation system and details of the segmentation algorithm are described in Wothke/Schmidt  ( 1991 )  . 
A morphological segmentation procedure for German has to deal with the following basic features of German morphology : ? Composition  . 
? Derivation.
? lnflexion.
? Ambiguous morph structure : Some words can be segmented in several ways  . 
? Reduction of conson an triples : If two lexical morphs are concatenated  , where the first morphends in a vocalic letter and two identical consonantal letters and the second morph starts with the same consonantal etter and a vocalic letter  , then the result of the concatenation does not contain the consonantal letter three times but only twice  . -The inverse process , i . e . 
trebling of double consonants , has to be carried out , when segmenting such words . 
Figure 1 shows the architecture of the morphological segmentation system  . The interpreter for the segmentation has 5 main input files : Ac'I~DE COLING-92  , NANTES , 2328 AOt'/T1992 1218 PROC .

2 THELINGUISTIC

The main linguistic knowledges our ccs of thc system are the morph dictionary  , which contains information about tile morph class /es each morph belongs to  , and tile word syntax . 
We developed a classification scheme lbr German morphs and a suitable word syntax  . 
The signiticant step to our current version was the classification of an extensive German morph list based on about  9  , ( 100 nlorphs compiled by the Institut fi ~ rdeutsche Sprachcm Mannheim  ( Germany )  . We merged the scmorphs with an expcrim cntallist of about  2  , 2 00 morphs which we used in tile former versions of our system  . Additionally , we increased the resulting list up to a hnost I1 , 000 entries by many lore ign morphs . 
It turned out that for the manual development of the syntax the tormal is mo  ( " finite state networks is easier to handle than a right linear regular grammar  . So we lirst represented the syntax with a finite statcnet work  , which finally was translated into a tuoctionally equivalent right linear grammar  .

So far , we have developed and tested successively four classification schemes  , each with a new , better syntax . We describe the third and fourth scheme , which are of actual interest ( cf . 
table 1).
The substructures of the entire transition net dealing with the word classes verb  , adjective , noun etc . will be called verb net , adjectivenet , nounnet etc . We should stress that these substructures are not independent automata with any separate input  . Nevertheless we call themnets ; parts of these nets will be called subnets . -Although the word formation of the different word classes is not fully distinct and does share some substructures  , it was not possible to design the entirenet in such a way that the nets for these word classes physically share some subnets  . Instead physical copies of common subnets had to be created for each occurrence of such a subnet in each of the nets  . This is since we used a finite state network for the representation of the word syntax  . This formalism does not allow to activate from different points one common subnet and afterwards to return to the appropriate activation point  . 
We will limit the following description to the nets for those word classes with productivity in word formation  . 

Our VerbNet is responsible for the segmentation of finite verbs  . Those of its subnets containing stem-labelled arcs refer to different combinations of mood  , tense , and weakness vs strongness of the verb stem . Each of these combinations demands specific inflexional endings  . -Weak stems are tense-invariant , strong stems can vary-according to tense-by vowel gradation  ( Umlautor Ablaut )  . As a consequence , the classification of strong verb stems is oriented towards their suitability for certain tenses  . For example , <= ging > is an imperfectense form of <= geh % en >  ( engl . 
togo ) . In our morph dictionary the two morphs < geh > and < ging > are two independent ries  , each with its own tense-oriented classification . We akstems are classified according to prefixation and derivation needs  . We took into accounthree groups Overview of the Extent of the Syntaxes and Classification Systems Developed of derivational suffixes :  1  ) <- el > , <- er > , 2) <- ig > , <- lich > , and 3) < ~ ier > . In the area of verb prefixes , one problem solved in our current version was to avoid the splitting of particular prefixes  , e . g . * <+ her+unter-=geh % en > apart of the correct segmentation which is <+ her unter=ge h % en >  ( engl . : to go down ) . 
In German , each infinitive can take the role of a noun , and each participle can do the same after being inflected  . As a consequence , the part of our transition net related to in finite verbs is integrated into the NounNet  . 
The set of verb stem classes had to be expanded for our current version to implement composition restrictions concerning verb stems as parts of nouns  . For example , we had to cope with missegmentations such as ? < +Er = find+er=sehon % ung > apart of the correct segmentation <+ Er = find % er -= schon % ung >   ( engl . careful treatment of inventors ) . At least two restrictions exist : Firstly , the verb stem < find > is not allowed before a noun  ( which the word ? < Er schonung > would be , if existing ) but , e . g . , the originally identically classified verb stem < bind > is  , as in < Bindladen > ( engl . 
string ) . Secondly , the morph < er > is no suitable prefix for the verb stem < schon > but  , e . g . , for the originally identically classified verb stem < schein >  , leading to < erscheinen > ( engl . to appear ) . Verb-stem-related restrictions like these , which we implemented in our system by adding morph classifications to the existing ones  , are only relevant for nouns , in the first case mentioned above , this is obvious . The second restriction does not concern finite verbs  , because misseg-mentations only occur when the morph < er > is positioned between two stems  . At the beginning of a word , the morph < er > can be seen as a prefix without any restrictions  . 

The adjective net consists of three subnets , each representing a possible way of adjectival derivation in German  . 
I . Simple adjectives like < schnell > ( engl . : last ), < s chOn > ( engl . : beautiful ) etc . 
AcrEsDECOLING-92 . NAN'rF_S , 2328 AOl'rr 1992l220 PROC . OFCOLING-92 . NANTES , AUG .  2328, 1992
These stems can be compared and inflected . Some stems occur only in a certain degree o\[ comparison like < bess >  ( stem of engl . : better ), < b cs > ( stem of engl . : best ) . They have obligatory comparative or superlative sufiixes while the corresponding stems of the positive degree must not be followed by tllese suffixes  , like e . g . < gut > ( engl . : good ) . 
2 . Adjectives derived from verbs or verbal stems like <+ be = gch % bar >  ( engl . : passable ) 3 . Adjectives derived from nonns . Example : <= held % en % haft > ( engl . : heroic ) . 
As a peculiarity o1"German word formation , a past participle may be compared and intlected like an adjective stem  . l ! xampte : The past participle of < g cling cn > ( engl . : to succeed ) has the comparative forms <+ ge -= lung % en > , <+ ge = lung % en % er > , <( am ) + ge = lung % en % st % en > . These may be translated as " successful , more successful , most successful ' . 
Roughly speaking , the concept of the adjectivenet is to allow an adjective stem to be substituted by more complex constructions  , like the ones described above . Special subnets are existing for adverbs and to t adjectives with non-German stems  . The latter is needed for marking foreign suffixes like in <= parall_el > because these suffixes attract the word accent  , which in ( ierman causes a vowel to be pronounced long . 

A very productive feature of German word formation in th carca of nouns is composition : New nouns may be fbrmed by concatenation of lexical morphs  , optionally interspersed with prefixes , suffixes , and infixes . In our nounnet , this feature is modelled by loops over lexical morphs which can be left by inflexion modules to reach a final state and which cross infix modules  ( including zero-infix )  , prefix modules , and ( derivational ) suffix modules . 
lnflexional suffixes occurring in compound nouns between lexical morphs are treated by us the same way as infixes  . 
Noun stems are classilied according to the feature sumlaut  , etymology ( German vs not German ) , obligatory affix , in I lexional suflix , and compositioneeds . 
Foreign Words
Each of the described nets contains subnets dealing with the l ~ brmation of foreign words which are involved in German word formation  , e . g . <= mum . ifiz % ier % en > ( engl . to mumify ), <= Basis > ( engl . basis ), <= l'ort~ier(Frenctii engl . porter ) . 
Foreign words without connection to German word t brmation and names are not intended to be segmented by our system  . So an unsegmented word is not necessarily a system failure but can be a required rejection  ( el . 
Table 3).
3 EVALUATION
The experimental morph list used during the development of versions  1  ,  2 , and 3 of " our syntax and classilication scheme consisted of  2  , 200 morphs mainly selected from Ortmann (1985) . In the fourth system the morph list was extended to a h no st  11  , 00 (1 morphs ( cf Table 1) . To evaluate the different versions ( each consisting of syntax and classification scheme  )  , two word sets were used each con-raining 3 , 0 (10 words . The first set consisted of rank1-1 , 000 ,  300 , ( X)1-301 , 000 , and 600 , 001-601 , 0 00 of a ti'equency list sorted in descending order which was created fi~oma corpus containing articles of a German business newspaper with about  31  , 000 , ( X ) 0 running words . This set was used for the iterative improvement of " our system  . 1 t is called test set . 
The second set , serving as a control set , con ~ rained rank 1 , 001-2 , 000 ,  200 , 001-201 , 000 , and 400 , 001-401 , 0 00 of a corpus obtained from a common newspaper with about  13  , 200 , 000 running words . The control set was necessary because of the risk that the later versions were designed in such a way as to cope only with those errors which arose when applying the earlier versions to tire test set  . 
Table 2 shows the improvement in coverage in a inly achieved by extending the morphlist : While - refcrriug to the control set only-the third system segmented only  !/125 of the input words ( =47 . 5%) , the lourth system segmented 2 , 492 words (= 83%) . The quality of the segmentations of the t burth system is a little worse  . The reason for this effect is the larger morph list allowing more nonsense concatenations of morphs  . Although we made grammar and classification system more restrictive  , it would have been too costly to strive for equal or better segmentation quality  . 
Table 3 gives an overview of the words which were not segmented by the fourth system  . 
Many of them are proper names.

4 CONCLUSION
A morph classification scheme and a syntax for the segmentation of German words were developed  , with which more than 99% of the segmented words were correctly segmented , i . e . at least one resulting segmentation was correct . 
With the extended morph list used about 13 . 2% of the words (=793 out of 6 , 000) were not segmented . Out of these unsegmented words , 68 . 7% a priori could not be segmented , i . e . no conceivable segmentation procedure can segment these words  . 
Results for Words Rejected by Fourth Version of the Segmentation Procedure  3  . We would also like to express our gratitude for the encouragement received from our manager Eric Keppel  .
