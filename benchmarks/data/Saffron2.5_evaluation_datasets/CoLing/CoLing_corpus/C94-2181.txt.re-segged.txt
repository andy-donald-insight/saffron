1. Introduction
Discourse Representation Theory ( DRT ) due to Kamp ( 1981 ) provides a promising framework for discourse semantics  . DRT is in fact successul in formalizing several challenging topics  , e . g . anaphora , tense and belief ; see Asher (1986 , 1993) and Helm (1982) . Due to its clear semantics with the construction algorithm  , DRT is also used as a background theory in computation all htguistics  ; see Wada and Asher ( 1986 ) and Ishikawa and Akama ( 1992 )  . 
However , DRT lacks a deductive ( proof-theoretic ) formulation to serve as an abstract interpreter for discourse understanding  , since it is formalized by means of the notion of partial models  . This prevents us from utilizing DRT in various ways for natural anguage understanding systems  . To make DR'\]' more flexible for computational linguistics  , we need to generalize a formal basis in a proof -theoretic fashion  . If this is successful , computational linguists will be able to reconstruct DRT for their own systems using programming languages like Prolog and LISP  . There are perhaps several ways to give an operational semantics of DRT  . 
One of the attractive approaches i to investigate consequence rlations associated with DR'I ?  . 
It is thus very useful to study some consequence relations in DRT to develop different versions of DRT  . 
The purpose of this paper is to explore consequence relations in DRT  , one of which exactly produces Kamp's original semantics  . We incorporate some consequence rlations defined by partial semantics into DRT using sequent calculi  . Our attempt enables us to display several versions of DRT by employing different consequence rlations  . We also show some connections of the proposed consequence rlations and partialogics in the literature  . 
2. Overview of DRT
In this section , we give a brief introduction to DRT . For a detailed exposition , the reader should consult Asher (1993) . The basic idea of DRT is to formalize a dynamic representation of partial interpretations by means of classical models using a construction algorithm of discourse representation structures  ( DRSs )  . 
Observe that DRSs can be regarded as such abstract objects as partial models  , mental representations , or ( partial ) possible worlds . But , significance of DRT . 
'\]' he language of DRT is called Discourse Representation Language  ( DRL )  , which is like a standard quantifier-free first -order language except discourse referents and conditions  . The logical symbols of DRL include=: ( identity )  , --~( comlitional ) , V ( disjunction ) and ~( negation ) . A discourse representation ( DR ) K is expressed as a pair ( UK , ConE ) , where UE is a set of discourse re\]erents , and Conic is a set of conditions . Each condition is either atomic or complex . Complex conditions are of the form : K1:~K2 , KIVK2 or ~ K1 , where both K1 and K2 are Dl~s . 
A discourse representation structure ( DRS ) is a partially ordered set of DRs , which can be constructed by means of DRS construction rules whose application reflects the syntactic composition of the sentences in the discourse  . 
When each DR of a DRS is maximal , the DRS is called a complete DRS . Intuitively speaking , each stage in the construction algorithm can be viewed as a partial possible worlds  , in which more information resulting from the processing of a further bit of the discourse changes it into a more precise description of the world  . 
A model for DRL is an ordered pair ( DM,
FM ) , where DM is the domain of M and FM is an interpretation function of constants and predicates  . An embedding \] ' unction for a DRK in a model M is a mapping from discourse referents in UK into the domain of M  . An extension of an embedding flmction f for K in M to an embedding function g for K ' in M is defined as g:  ( Dora ( f ) UUE , ) -- ~ DM . We write fCK g to mean that g extends an embedding function f to an embedding of K '  . The notaion M~-t , KC abbreviates that M satisfies C under f for K . A proper embedding of K in M is an embedd htg flmetion such that f ~ Kg and for any condition Cin K  , M  ~ g , EC . The notions of proper embedding and satisfaction can be extended to general cases by slmnltaneous recursion  ; see Asher (1993) . ADRK is shown to be true in a model Miff there is a proper embedding of K in M  . ADRK implies a DRK'iff every model in which K is true is also a model in which K ' is true  . This definition induces a consequence relation in DRT  , but we have no reason to consider it as the only plausible for DRT  . In fact , it is our jobint Ms paper to seek alternate definitions  . 
3. Consequence Relations and Sequent
Calcull
A partial semantics for classical logic is implicit in the socalled Beth table aux  . This insight can be generalized to study consequence relations in terms of Gentzen calculi  . The first important work in this direction has been done by van Benthem  ( 1986 ,  1988) . We here try to apply this technique to DRT . Since our approach can replace the base logic of DRT by other interesting logics  , we obtain alternative versions of DttT . 
Recall the basic tenet of Beth table aux.
Namely , Beth table aux ( also semantic table aux ) prove X--~Y by constructing a counterexam-pie of XK:~Y  . In fact , Bethtable aux induce partial semantics in the sense that there may be counterexamples venifa branch remains open  . Let X and Y be sets of formulas , and A and B be formulas . And we write XbY to mean that Y is provable from X  . VanBen-there's partial semantics for classical logic can be axiomatized by the Gentzen calculus  , which has the axiom of the form:
X , APA , Y and the following sequent rules : ( Weakening ) X b Y ~ X , AFA , Y . 
(Cut ) X , AbY and XFA , Y = --~ XFY.
( ~ R ) X , AbY ~ Xb ~ A , Y .
( ~ L ) XPA , Y ~= ~ X , ~ At-Y .
(& R . ) XPY , h and XFY , B = - . ~ Xt-Y , A&B . 
(&L)X,A,BbY---.s X , A&BPY.
(vR)XPA,B,Y~XPAvB,Y .
(vL)X , AFY and X , Bt-Y ==> X , AVBbY.
Van Benthem's formulation can be extended for part i allogics  . Because such an extension difficult to recast the tzeatment for DRT  . 
Let V be a partial valuation assigning 0 , 1 to some atomic formula p . Now , we set V ( p ) = 1 for p on the lefthand side and V ( p )  =  0 for p on the right hand side in an open branch of Beth table aux  . This construction can be easily accommodated to sequent calculi  . Then , we can define the following two consequence relations :  ( C1 ) for all V , if V(Pr  e ) = 1 then V ( Cons ) = 1 , ( C2) for all V , if V(Pre ) = 1 then V(Cons ) #0 , where Pre and Cons stand for premises ( antecedent ) and conclusion ( succedent ) of ase-qnent , respectively . In a classical setting , ( C1) and ( C2) coincide . It is not , however , the case for partial logics . 
The Gentzen calculus G1 for C1 is obtainable from the above system without right  ( ~ ) -rule by introducing the following rules : ( ~R ) X ~- A , Y ~ XP ~ A , Y . 
( ~ L ) X , AF-Y ~ X , ~- A ~- Y .
aR)x ~ A,Y
X ~-~( A&B ), Y .
( ~& L)X ,,-~ AF-Y and X , ~ B~-Y
X , ~( A&B)~-Y .
(,-~ VR ) XF-~A,Y and X~-NB , Y
XP--~(AVB ), Y .
( ~ VL)X ,,-~ A,~Bt-Yx,~(AvB)t-Y . 
Van Benthem ( 1986 ) showed that G1 is a Gentzentype axiomatization of C1  . To guarantee a cut- . free formulation , we need to modify van Ben-them's original system . We denote by GC1 the sequent calculus for GC1 , which contains the axioms of the form : ( A 1 ) A-A and ( A2 ) A , - - ~ A ~ - , with the right and left rules for (&) , ( V ) ,  (~)  ,   ( ~ & ) and ( ~ V ) together with ( Weakening ) and ( Cut )  . It is shown that GC1 is equivalent o G1 without any difficulty . As a consequence , we have:
Theorem 1
C1 can be axiomatized by GC1.
The Gentzen system GC2 for C2 can be obtained from ( GC1 ) by adding the next axiom : ( A3 ) A , ~ A . 
Theorem 2
C2 can be axiomatized by GC2.
There are alternative ways to define consequence relations by means of sequent calculi  . 
For example , it is possible to give the following alternate definitions  . 
( C3) for a HV , if V ( Pre ) --1 then V ( Cons ) = 1 and if V ( Cons ) = 0 then V ( Pre )  = 0 . 
The new definition obviously induces in consistent valuations  . The Gentzen system GC3 is obtainable from GC1 by replacing ( A2 ) by the following new axiom : ( A4 ) A , -A ~ B , ~ B . 
Theorem $
C3 can be axiomatized by GC3.
4. Relation to Partial Logics
In this section , we compare the proposed Gentzen systems with some existing partial logics  , in particular , three-valued and four-valued logics in the literature  ; see Urquhart (1986) . To make connections to partial logics clear , we extend DRL with weak negation "--" to express the lack of truth rather than verification of falsity in discourses  . We denote the extended language by EDRL . In the presence of two kinds of negation , we can also define two kinds of implication as material implications  . We need the next rules for weak negation : ( -R ) X , A ~- V ~ X ~ - - ~ A , Y . 
XA , X , Y .
In fact , these rules provide a new consequence reation of EDRL denoted by ~ EDRL  . Our first result is concerned with the relationship of  GC1 and Kleene's ( 1952 ) strong three-valued logic KL , namely
Theorem 4
The consequence rlations of GC1 and KL are equivalent . 
From this theorem , EDRL can be identified with the extended Kleene logic EKL  . Let A-~,,B be an abbreviation of ~ AVB . Then , we can also interpret Luka siewicz's three-valued
D can be defined as follows:
ADB = a~t(A-~0B ) &( ~ B -* , ~~ A ) which implies t = EKLhDB iffA ~: EKLB and ~ B ~ EKL~i  . 
This is closely related to the consequencer la - tion  C3  . 
Theorem 5
AFc , a Biff ~ EKLADB .
If we drop ( A2) from GC1 , we have the sequent calculus GCI- , which is shown to be equivalent to Belnap's ( 1977 ) four-valued logic BEL . 
Theorem 6~-BEL=~GC1-"
The four-valued logic BEL can handle both incomplete and inconsistent information  . We believe that four-vaNed semantics is plausible as a basis for representational semantics like DRT  , which should to relate inconsistent information in discourses  . In view of these results , we can develop some versions of DRT which may correspond to current three-valued and four-vahed logics  ; see Akama (1994) . 
5. Conclusions
We have studied a proof-theoretic foundation for DRT based on consequence relations defined by partial semantics  . These consequence relations yield alternative versions of DRT to be used for different applications  . We have noted some connections between these relations and partial logics  , in particular three-valued and four-valued logics  . We believe that the significance of our work lies in reformulating DRT in sequent calculi to be easily applied to computational linguistics  . 
There are several topics that can be further developed  . First , we should give a more detailed discussion of what sort of completeness proof is involved  , although we have established some correspondence rsults  . Second , it is very interesting to show how the proposed consequence relations affect DRT in mo~e detailed ways  . Third , we need to extend the present work for the predicate case to take care to capture the dynamic effect of the quantificational structure of DRT  .
