I . INTII . ODUCTION
In this paper , we give a formed representation of the thematie -rhematic  ( ' P-ll ) structure of a , nahum\]ls Ln-triage discourse . Some pairs , triples , or in general n-tuples of sentences in a discourse may differ in the  1  ) h Lee of the h'information focus . The distribution of this inform ~ t tion focus is c ~dled the thematic-thematic  ( TR ) structure , or dichotomy . \[n English , the use of paa'ticle stile and a ( an ) is deeply related to tile T-llstrncture . lit general , a noun with the particle a constitutes arheme part of t it  (  ; sentence that appears at the \] ) cginiug of the discourse or text , while that noun with the p ~ Lrticle tl ~ e~ppe ~ rs ht the second  , third , etc . 
sentences ~ LS themes . In Ja . p~Lnese , the % 1 dichotomy is we . ll represented by postposit lons wa and . qa . The Koreanb Lnguage h~s a similar system . Meanwhile , in Slavic langu ~ rges~s Polish , Czech , and \] lnssian , the word order is free ~ nd this degree of freedom is used h  ) r the represent ~ tion\[the TR dichotomy . In Chinese , the word order is also used f ( ~ r the TR di ~ chotomy . Besides the me and rheme , simib Lr terms s . sold-information and new-it gormation , topic ~ nd comment , topic ~ tnd focus etc . ~re used in the literature concerning functionaL1 lingnistics ( see , e . g . , Va \] lduvi) . 
In our ~ tn ~ dysis , ince we do not define these terms explicily , it is not essent i ~ d which terms are used . We . 
give implicit definition of these concepts a . z ' iomati-cally . We eonside . r the problem mainly for J~p ~ Lnese . 
We propose to Its (' . typed A-c~deulus to analyse the problent . A logie ~ dnotation is seen as a typed X term . Batsi (: typess LreT and l . t . onghly speaking , 7' and llst and for a then w , l ) ~ rt ~ Lndar hem cpart of e ~ sentence , respectively .

Although we analysema . hdy Japanese sentences , the resnlts can betLpp\]ied to other langn , Lges . The T-\[~dichotomy of ~ tJapanese sentence is represented by the postpositions wa a  . ndga . For ext Lmple , the fololowing two sentences ~ redifferent in T -Idichotomy  , ~nd used in dit\[rentsitutttions : ( a ) Taroowa Gakusei , lea , , . ( Speaking of Ta , ' oo , he is a student )   ( b ) ' l ' arooga ( ? akusei desu . (( Of all the people we are talkinoabo , a ) "* ~ , ' oo ( ando , ~l , a7 a , ' oo)i . ~ ~,  . , t , , , ~ e,~t . ) The mo~ning or both ( , , ( l0')i,~~'~,, . 0 oi . , a . ~,, t ~, , ~, ~ nd thusma . y be wrlten~s student(T n . roo ) . I\[ow~ever this representation is obviously not sufficient for an ~ tcc ' ount of the utter ~ Lnce interpretation of  ( ~ ) and ( b )  . The NI' ( noun phrase ) of ( a ) marked with w a functions as ~ theme , i . e . , it should h~Lve ~ dready , ~ p-petered in the preceding discourse and thns can be considered ~ m ~ nold information  . Therefore , in the discourse , sentence ( ~ ) should t ) e preceded by ~ tsen-te neet hat contains " l'a ~ ' oo smarhe  . me(new information ) , l , ' or example , Taroo in the . fol\]owing sentence can be considered as ~ Lnew information :  ( c ) 7a , '0 ogaim a . su . (llc,'e is 7 h,'o o . ) The pair ( e ) ,   ( a ) in this order is ~ L correct discourse utterance . On the other h , ~ nd , the p~dr(c ) ,   ( b ) cannot be considered correct since student functions  , as ~ themein ( b ) while ith ~ m not appeared in the preceding context  . As is seen . q afnnctions as a theme ( i . e . , information focus ) . To explain the difference between ( a ) and ( b ) in the utterance level , we annotate Ax . student ( x ) of ( a ) and ( b ) by different typed A-terms . Roughly speaking we assign T---*It and R to each Ax  . stude M(x ) of ( a ) and ( b ), respectively . Based on this , if we can show student ( Taroo ) : 12 then we say sentence ( a )   ( or ( b ) ) of the discourse is correct . For example , if T aroo of ( @ has a type T then by the fl-reduction of typed A-calculus  , we have student ( Taroo):12 . For Taroo to have a type T , we impose a constrain that Taroo must have appeared in a preceeding sentence  . Other cases can be treated similarly . See the following descriptions for details . Thus the correctness of the discourse CaLL be proved by checking the correctness of the types of eavh formula  . In general , given a discourse so , sa , "'  , s , ~ in logical forms , what we have to show is that ( kso:12) , ( so : 12kst:R ) ,   .   .   . , ( so:R , .   .   . , s,~-L:R~"s,~:R ), succesively . 
First consider the following discourse consisting of a single sentence  . 
Taroogai masu . ( Here is Taroo .) (1)
The meaning of this sentence is : so = here_is ( Taroo )   ( 2 ) We define this discourse to be correct if so : R . This is done in the following way : Translate Taroogain to Af  . f(Taroo ) . We let this formula have either type of T--+ 12 or 12  --~  12 when the proper noun Taroo is marked with the postposition ga  . Thus we have the following translation rules : Tarooga ~ Af  . f(Taroo ) Eso:T---,R (3 . 1) Tarooga ~ Af . f(Taroo)~s0:R~R (3 . 2)
This can be writen for short as
Tarooga ~ Af . f ( Taroo ) ffso: ( To r12 ) - + t t ( 4 ) In the above , t ~_ s0 means that t is a typed A-term component of the logie M formula so  . That is tg so if \](? t l , t2 ) tLtt2 = so ( 5 ) A sentence of neatral description in the Jap~nese language was first found and named by Kuroda  ( 1965 )  . 
This kind of sentence has no theme part . For this kind of verb , we assign a type R and write ms follows : kAx . here_is ( :~ ) E_so:12 ( 8 ) Now by ( 6 ) and ( 8 ) we can deduce the following judgement . 
eo : Ao , ea : A1F ( Af . f(Taroo )) ( Acv . here_is(x )) = ( Ax . here _ is (*)) ( Taroo ) = here Ss(Taroo ) = , so : R ( 9 ) where e0:A0 and el : A1 stand for ( 6 ) and ( 8 )  , respectively . Thus , so: 12 has been proved and the correctness of the discourse  ( 1 ) has been established . 
To deduce (9) , we have of course used the inference rule of the typed A-caJculus given by co:a--+fl  , el:cYPeoel:fl ( 10 ) Note that the type used for ( Af . \]( Taroo )) in deduction (9) is R-+R . In general , for a neutral description , fl-reduction for 12 + R ~ ndR occur . Next we consider the discourse consisting of the following two sentences  . 
Taroo 9 aimasu . ( Here is Taroo .) (11.1)
Taroowa 9akuseidesu . ( Taroo is a student . ) (11 . '2 ) The TR dichotomies of tile above sentences are as follows: 
Taroogai masu.
Rheme Rheme (12.1)
Taroowagakusei desu.
Theme Rheme (12.2)
The NP ( noun phrase ) of (12 . 2) marked with w a functions as a theme . It should have already appeared in the preceding discourse as a rheme  . The discourse ( 12 ) satisfies this constraint since Taroo appears a rhem c in  ( 12 . 1) since it is marked with the post-position ya . The discourse (12) is ax:tnally correct . 
We now formally state the correctness of (12) . The tlere t ~ and/or t2 may be empty . Thus so_ . so . From logical forms of (:12 . 1) and (12 . 2) are given as (3), we have ~- A/ . /( T ~ roo ) C . 90: ( T or R ) - - , n (6) The verb imasual lows a neutrM description . A neutral description has the following TR dichotomy : 
Taroogai masu.
Rheme Rheme (7) . ~ o = ~ ere_i4T ~ roo ) (13 . 1) sL = ~ t ~ de,~t(Taroo ) (13 . 2) First we must shows o:12 , however we have M-ready seen this . Thus we shows L : R . Note that so = ( Ax . student(x )) ( Taroo ) . It is natural to ~ ssiguAx . student(x ) a type T ~ R since (12 . 2) contains them attic wa . We write this ~ s follows . 
waflakuscides u == ~
Ax . studt:nt(a :) ~ s , : 7' ~ R ( l ' h ? ~ sweht ~ ve ( 14 ) 2' h crefore if Tarooh ~ us at type T , we hKvest : 1 ~ byfl-reduction . The NP ca , nbe , ~ theme if it has MreMy atppeared in the preceding discourse mst ~ rheme  . This rule e~tn be written as follows : & f . /( To . roo ) ~_ so : ('1' or ~)--~~ ~ ~ ~ r , , . o , , gs , :" r(~6) Now . st:\]/,e~nbeshow , , ats follows . By (6) amd ( H0,~-T, . roo~st : 7' ( 17 ) Applying the fl-reduction rule to ( 15 ) at nd ( 17 )  , we hatvest : R . Thus the discourse (11) is correct . 
in Japatnese , the following sentence art the beginning of the discourse is not n ~ turM  . 
~r,, . oo , , , , , . , , , a: . , , , s ~; des , , . (:r~, . o ~ is ~, . .~,, . d ~ , , ~ . )  ( ~ s ) This is bec~Luse Taroo atppe ~ tr sats t ~ then te but it is not proceeded by ~ sentence in which ~ lhrooat ppeatrsaa ~ rheme  , in our form M description , the incorrectness of the discourse ( 18 ) is described ~ us at fatihlre of type cheekhlg . We define the discourse to be incorrect if either so : I ?  . or Sl : R is not proved . Indeed , so : I ~ , where so = st ~ Ment(Taro , o ) is not proved since we do not have Ta . rooE . so : T . 
We now consider the following discourse consisting of two sentences  . 
Ga . k'l~ . s ~ igaim as u .  (19 . 1)7' o . roo ( . laflokus cidesu .  (19 . 2) The logle Mformsre , "(~9 . 1) at nd (19 . 2) ~ regiven , ' us follows . 
.so = (9:c)studcnl(x ) A here_is(x ) (20 . 1) S1::s ~, l(tg'l\],l(T(troo ) (20 . ~ ) Since flakusci ( student ) is m~rked with the post posi-tlou Oa , at nd the verb imasu ~ fllows ~ nentratl descrlp -tiolGweh~tvel " rom this we hatve  ,  (3 , )st~ , ~ , ,t (~ , ) ~  . %: ~  ( uu ) In genera \] we hnpose the following postub~te . 
AABEs I:I ?, FAEs~:1~(23)
Furthermore we atdd the following postula , te.
(&; y(x ) Eso:I~~-~x'/(:'0Es , :" r(24) where Q stands for a qn~ud ; if ier V or 3 . This postul ~ d ; emeans that tatpred lc~tte that t ~ ppeatred as ~ trheme cat n be treatted sts at theme in the succeeding sentences  . 
From this ~ uM(22) we c~n de ducea : , . s , , , ee , , , , ~( . ~) Cs , : T (~ s ) We . now shows , : R . I " irst l ) y (4) we h ~ v e (6) . Applying the fl-reduction rule (10) to (6) ~ t , ~< l (25) w chatves l = s b u . denl(Ta . roo ): R . Therefore , the discourse (19) is correct . Note that the type used for A/ . f(Taroo ) is 7'-~ ll . Compatre this with (9) . 
We now consider the following discourse consisting of at single sentence ~ 
Taroo 9agakusei desu .   ( 26 ) \[ n the atbove sentence type checking fM ls ~ , s follows . 
Since the postposition 9 a is , ~t tavhed to Taroo , we . 
hatve (6) . Therefore , Ax . student(x ) E . so must hatve~t type of either T or 1L I lowever this is impossible . 
Since flakuseide suc~tn not be used in at sentence of neutrM description  , Am . student ( x ) Fs in ever has at type/L The sentence x ga gakuseid csuM watys meatns that t it is x who is a student ~ nd is used only in the situat tkm where gakus ci is a theme  . According to Kuno (1973) , this use of predicate is cM led the exhgust lve -listing  . On the other h~nd , Ax . student ( x ) cat n have ~ type T only when student ha . q at p p e a t r e d a . sin ( 21 ) in the preceeding context at nd the postulatte ( 24 ) cat n be used . Since (26) does not h~ve ~ preceeding text , it never hatppens . Thus itf Mlsto proves o:II~mdith~ts been est M  ) lished that t ( 26 ) is not n correct disconrse . 
So fitrweh ~ ve considere discourses consisting of two sentences  , fIo we ver the atbove method ctLnbe easily extended to a discourse that is consisting of more th ~ n three sentences  . In this case , the inference rules used over sever M sentences at remodified  . For exatm-pie , (16) can be modified ats follows : Af . f(Taroo)Esl,i<j : ( T or R ) -+ R
HTaroo E , sj : T ( 16' ) where si denotes the logle Mh ) rm corresponding to the ith sentence of ~ discourse  . Furthermore , 7' arooc~n of course be a trbitratry term , a ~ nd thus we ( : at nest M ) \] ish the following more genera \] rule: ( 1c , ") In this paper , we have given a form M representation of the TR structure of a natural language discourse  . 
We have proposed using a notion of typed/k -cMculus  . 
A logical notation has been seen as a typed ) , - term . 
The correctness of a given discourse can be proved by checking the correctness of the types of each utter-ante  . Although we have analysed mainly Japanese sentences  , the results can be applied to other lnn-guages by considering adaquate translation rules to encode a given sentence to formal representations  . 
in Uetake (1993 ,  1994) , the author has proposed another tool for the analysis of the TR structure  . The toolnsed there is a logical notation called ontological promiscuity of I lobbs  ( 1985 )  , which is first-order and nonintension M . Using this description , a proof process of utterance interpretation of a discourse is obtained  . It is interesting that two concepts similar to these  ( i . e . , typed A-c~dculus and ontological promiscuity ) used in the analysis of the TR structure of a discourse are used in the theory of constructive mathematics  ( r-realizability and constructive type theory )  . The concept of ontological promiscuity in Ue take ( 1993 ,  1994 ) corresponds to ther-re Mizability and the typed )  , -c~l culns of this paper to the constructive type theory  . See Uetake (1994) for more detailed discussion .
