In every application that concerns the automatic processing of natural language  , the problem of the dictionary size is posed . In this paper , we propose a compression dictionary al ~ or ithm based on an affix analysis of the nondia critical Arabic  . 
It consists in decomposing a word into its first elements taking into account the different linguistic transformations that can affect the morphological structures  . 
This work has been achieved as part of a study of the automatic detection and correction of spelling errors in the nondia critical Arabic texts  . 
I-INTRODUCTION
In every application that concerns the automatic processing of natural language  , the problem of the dictionary size is posed . We can approach this important question in several ways and particularly : - By grouping together the common prefixes of the different language words  . In the PIAF system , (interac-tive program for French Analysis ) for instance , words are represented in chained lists following an alphabetical order \[ COUR  77\] EX:PARTIEL ~ PARTIES _____--~_PARTOUT . . . 
PARTIE-~J
PART- , ~--- By creating multiple dictionaries : or : e for each major topic area  . This approach requires , in addition , a common base dictionary . When a particular area is concerned , a temporary master dictionary is created by increasin F the base dictionary with selected local ones  . 
-- By us in ~ the Affix analysis which consists in performing a morphological analysis in order to identify  , in a given word , the redundant elements ( Affixes ) . The dictionary will be limited to the nonredundant elements  ( roots )  . This technique is used specially in the DECIO- SPELL system for detecting and correcting spelling errors  . 
In the present paper , we will develop this last approach for the non_diacritical Arabic  . 
The particularities of the algorithms that we propose  , stem ~ in great part , form the specificities of the language used : - Words are written in consonantic form-Words can contain in fixes-Morphological structures can be altered by linguistic transformations  . 
This work has been developed within a national research project for the study of the automatic detection and correction of spelling errors in Arabic texts

III-AFFIXANALYSIS\] . Morphological decomposition The Affix analysis consists in decomposing a given word into its first elements among which we can distinguish the affixes  ( prefix , infix and suffix ) which are the redundant elements of the language and the root which is its nonredundant one  . 

This decomposition is based on the derivational structure of the \] anguage : nearly all the words are obtained by adding an affix combination to a given root  . 
suffixInfixRootPrefixes-Root=~ka ~ aba- Prefix = ~- Infix = ~ tO-Suffix="&--?Among the possible affix combnations  , we distinguish those that are valid and those that are not  . 
Valid combinations constitute what is called Morpho-\]ogical Pattern  ( MP ) For a given word , the number of possible morphological decnmpositim ~s depends on the root  , according to whether or not it contains characters which can be assimilated to different affixes  . 
This nui ~ ) er is calculated using the following formula :
Nd = Card(b ~ i ~ . (lard(c ~) j)2 . Study of the morphological transformations The morphological derivation for a root can be accompanied with transformations caused by linguistic ohenomena such as asshnilation  , contraction , metath is Js . 
These transformations can affect the Root as well as the affixes  ( MP )  . The Roots affected are mainly those which contain the characters yaa : q  , Waw : ~ and hamza:

- The purely phonological transformations are those that suppress one or more characters  , therefore they modify the length of the word .

To remove these ambiguities , we use heuristics among which we can mention for instance : Let D be the morphological derivatio ~ operator such as : D  ( R , P , I , S ) = WW ~ V and T the operator composed of a derivation followed by a transformation  . And D them or E~ol Oglcal dec6mpo-sit , on operator ( inverse of D ) and T the morphological decomposition operator taking into account the transformational rules  ( inverse of T )  .

The affix analysis is composed of two modu\] . es ( See Fig . I ) :- morphological decomposition module- validation modu\]e  1  . The morphological decomposition module permits to --~  . de ' ~ Ty the different ~- ombinations . 
It is executed in two steps :

Step two : identification of the infix by a naysing -t ~ Te remaining chain after eliminating P and

The interest of realising this decomposition into two steps lies in the use of a single analyser in order to rec  . ' ognise all the morphological forms .

2. Validation module
The two precedin ~ steps lead to a list of candidate decompositions  . \] it is necessary to apply to this list an adequate validation mechanism to sort out the valid decomposition This fi \] terin ~ can provide multiple solutions  . 
In these conditions , we talk about morphological ambiguity that can not be removed without considering the context : of the word in the sentence  . 
However , the affix analysis used for the purpose of verifying whether or not a word belongs to the language can be content with the first valid decomposition  .

Fi ~\[: Functional Affix Analysis diagram The validation is based on the principle of affi ~ congruity and on the result of the root dictionary checking  . 
The affix congruity arises at three different levels : - Compatibility between the prefix  ( P ) and the suffix ( S ) -Compatibility between the couple ( P , q ) : ~ n ~ the infix ( I ) . 
-Compatibility between the Morphological
Pattern(P , I , S ) and the Root ( R).
The compatibility between P and S is obtained from the affix congruity matrix C  ( P . , S . ) composed of 609 e~ements ( 2 prefixes and 29 su~fi ~ es )  . The values attributed to a couple ( P . , S . ) are : C(P . , S . ) = O if PI and ~ . ~ reincompatible

V-CONCLUSION
The affix analysis permits to replace an important dictionary containing roots only  . This technique has proved efficient for Arabic because of its derivational structure  . We have tested this technique on a corpus made up of \]  O0  , 000 words or so using the dictionary of the 1 , 600 roots . 
The programs are written in FORTRAN for reasons of portability  , easy calculation of the Dictionary access argument and index manipulation  . 
Used in the context of the detection and correction of spelling errors  , the affix analysis is interesting in " that : in memory iI $ makes easier the use of the dictionary lomded-performs a natural cutting of the words  , which facilitates the algorithms of automatic correc-ting based on inferential mechanisms and heuristics These features ~ ive the suggested algorithms some originality and a contribution tb the work Jn the field of Arabic morphological analysis  .
