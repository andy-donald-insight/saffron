It is widely known that the word formation mechanism of compounding is highly productive  , in German as well as in English , and that efficient strategies have to bc , lcvelop cd to d cal with this linguistic phe nomenon in any kind of NI  , 1 ~ system .

With German as the source language , the first prohlem in the treatment of compound words arises from the fact that German compounds are written in one word and that in many cases  , the form of the words in a compound differs front the baseform in that either a socalled ~ hgen element  ( connecting element or juncture morpheme ) is added to tl ~ emodify-ins word or that one or more letters are taken away from the ending of these words  , ht order to allow for a correct segmentation of the compounds  , a code has to be added next to the morphological declension code of the entries in the analysis part of the lexicon pointing to the corresponding morpheme types  . 
2.2 Code for the Connecting Element
The importance of the correct encoding of the connecting elerncut is shown in the following example  . 
Suppose a word like Arb cits amt ' job tenter ' wouht not have an entry in the lexicon and Arbeif would no the encoded with the connecting morpheme ' s '  . The system would then decompose the unknown word into Arbeif  ( ' job , work ') which is still correct , and Semi (' ~ el~ct ' , which is obviously not the expected second constituent  ( which has to be Am (   ( ' offtce , department , tenter ' ) because the ' s ' is not interpreted ~ sa morpheme but a stile first letter of the second constituent  . ~ For several reasons , the correct encod-ins of the connecting morphemes  ( l ' ~ gen-code ) in not ms trivial as it might appear . First , there are various types of these elements : zero morpheme : Umweft  . - ~ Umwell be we onng ; addition of a form of the inflectional paradigm of the word  , e . g . the pluralending : Diskette--*Diskette+n -lan Jwerk  ; addition of a letter which in not in the inflectional paradigm : Instal-laflon - ~ lnstallation+s programm  ; deletion of the ending : Schnle ~ Schnlhot , deletion of th cending and addition of another letter : Weihnachten 
Weihnaehl+skonzert.
There are quite a lot of words , however , which can take more than one type of connecting morpheme  . In some cases , it is only a question of usage , depending on the head noun , in which form the word appcars ; in other cascs , the type of jura : ( ere morphcme has significance in meaning distinction  . The noun Geschicht cF'story/hislory ' ) is an example fur such a case ( of . 
leischer 19821):
Geschicht+s-buch'history book '
Geschichte+n-buch'storybook '
This fact which can help disambignation has to be represented in the lexicon as a transfer constraint for compound nouns  . The type of juncture element is not predictable from other for ntal aspects of the nonn  , e . $ . 
from gender , declension code , etc . There are certain regularities , but they are no ~ consistent enongh to allow for an automatic encoding  . It is just a mlittle possible to derive the connecting elements completely from existing machine readable dictionaries  ( MILD )  ; as a prerequisite , all words would have to appear in an MRI ) in all their possible forms as modifying elements of compound words  . 
~More examples can be found in (\[ l , uckhstrdt/Zimmermannt991\] , ll 6f ) . 
The ( : odes which we assigned to the connecting elements relate only to the form of the morpheme  . As far as the implementation is concerned , the formal identity of some connecting elements and inflectional morphemes on the one haml is used to simplify the segmentation algorithm  , and , on the other hand , the diffcrence betwecn connecting elements which are in the inflectional paradigm and those which are not is used to make predictions on the possible position of a constituent in a compound word  . 
2.$ Possible Positions of Compound
Constituents
It is possible to draw certain conclnsions from the type of e onnecting element on the possible position of a constituent in a compound word  .  \] ) ependlng on whether the juncture morpimme has the same form as a h~rm of the in\[lectinnal paradigm of the word or not  , or whether the ending of the base form of the word is deleted or not  , the word with its juncture can be positioned as a modifying constitneut in the beginning or in the middle of the compound  , or am the modified constituent ( the head ) at the end , or in any ( : ombination of the mentioned positions . The following examples will make the idea clearer . 
1 3 Words with zero jnm : ture can be at any position ill a Conlponn rt word : Import-beschr Snkung  ( ' import restrletion ' ) 
Fisch-import (' fish import ')

' ~ LMT is a lexical is-tlc , source based transfer system , in this section , we concentrate on the performance of the PIDLOG algorithm ' Compound Interpretation COMPGE ' as a hookup component to LMTGE  ( German F , nglish ) .

The algorithm then takes the complete dictionary entry with sonrce and target word and all information contained in it +  , stores the word and continues by looking up the rest as a whole  . If an entry is fraud , it is stored as well , together with the relevant n torphological , syntactic , and seinantic information . If there is , on the other hand , no entry for the remainder as a whole , the seg-mentation is carried on letter for letter  , the same way as fortile first constituent until an analysis Siran existing entry is derived  . 
When alle on stltuents are found , the words are stored , and segmentation is started again in in order to allow  , in a , n biguous cases , for/rtorcth a none possi-hie segmentation .

The system which then has to choose between tile two possibilities wouhltake the second result following the general strategy that cmn pounds with two nominal constituents are r nuch more frequent than those with three elements  , those with three more frequent than those with four  , etc .

3.1 Feature Transfer

Ill . there is a specilic feature of the target word coded in the transh : r part or the lexicon which contlad lctua source feature  , the last one is ow ~ r writtea by the target h ~ at are  . If for instance the target word only occurs in the singular  , bu ~ the source head word of the compound has the feature plural  , the target word feature is preferred over the so nrce word feature  , and the compound will appear in the singubtr , e . g . the plural word lnduslric in Jor-mationen becomes a slagnlarill English induslry information I  ) ecause of the transfer lexicon part < t ( information ) /sg .

They are followed by the adjective noun-type (17 . 2%) and th .   .   .   . n-o \]-, .   .   .   .   . type (14 . 3%) . Considering all Germa nominal compounds and not only noun-nonn-compounds  ,  44 . 4% of tltem were translated into the English noun -noun-type  , s These are the data which formed the basis for oar first translation strategy  , namely to translate German nominal compoum ls per default into English noun noun constructions  . Since about 50% would then not be translated correctly , i . e . not according to language usage , this first approach as been augmented by corpus based techniques which are currently at art experiment a level  . 
$ . 8 Corpus Based Techniques $ . $ . 1 Selecting the Target Construct ion Recognizing that selecting the preferred target construction for a certain compound is in part a nar-hltrary decision of each language  , it seems suitable to look for the information in a target language corpus  . The idea is that when the English compound we should generate does not appear in the system's lexicon we will try to match it agains the corpus and select a preferred construction according to the information founds  . It should be noted at this point that in many cases there are several egitimate constructions that may be selected  , l to wever , the system cannot always distinguish these cases from cases where there is only one legitimate choice in the specific context  . Therefore , it is always necessary to make a selection , and our strategy is to prefer the construction that seems most probable for being a legitimate choice  . This strategy has also a stylistic advantage , as it prefers the more commonly used constructions  . 
The most simple antiaccurate method to start with is to search the corpus for explicit examples of the complete compoum l and prefer that construction which is most frequent  . For instance , the German compound ' Oppositiorts grappe'may in principle be translated  ( according to the findings described in the previou section  ) to either ' opposilio 9 group ' , ' group of opposition ' , ' opposilional group'or'opposi-lion's group ' . Consulting a corpus of 40 million words of The Washington Post articles enables us to prefer the first  ( ' noun-noun ) option as it occurs 89 times in the corpus , while the second option occurs only 3 times and the other options do not occur at all . On the other haml , in translating tile cmnponud'Par-laments de batte ' he statistics prefer the construction ' parliamentary debate '  ( 23 occurrences )  , where the modifier appears in its adjectival for nLIn this case  , the ' noun . noun ' for nt , ' parliament debate ' , does not occur in the corpns ~ and the form ' debate in parlia-ment ' occurs  3 times . 
In the cases mentioned above , the corpus provides enough examples of the exact compound we are looking for  . The only generalization that was used is to take into accmm the morphological inflections of the words  ( e . g . counting also occurrences of ' parliamen-SThe conirastlve studies and their results are described in detail in \[ Rackow  1992\]  .  9 , ?  . This approach is apph cable for an ) ' naturallan ~ ua\[~egeueraton task , hence the relevance of this section Is not restricted to the application of tnachine translation  . 
lary debates ', with the plural form of ' de 6 at e ~ . llow-ever , many compounds are to or areanti do not occur a significant number of times in the corpus  . In these cases it is necessary to use various generalizations over the constituents of the conlpmm dinor-tier to ohtain some relevant information  . A suitable solution into generalize over the part of speech of some of the words of the compound  . For example , the compomt d ' Um well be we gun 9' , may he translated ( among other options ) to ' eeolooy movement ' or ' ecological movement : This compmmd occurs only once in The Washington Post corpus  , in the form ' ecological movement ' , but this is not significant enough to make a selection  . In order to obtain more information we look for compmmds in which either ' ecology ' or ' ecological' serves as a prenominal modifier  , with no restriction on the specific word which serves am the head noun  . This information was searched for in the first 100  , 0 00 sentences of the Ilansard corpus of the proceedings of the Canadian parliament  , which was tagged with part of speech ush tga stochastic tagger\[Merialdo  199l  \] . In these sentences , the form ' eeoloqieal ( no an ) ' was oh scrved 11 times while tile form ' ecology ( noun ) ' only once . Using these statistics we regard the adjectival form ' ecological ' as the del ' aultform whenever the two alternatives are encountered and there are not enough examples of the complete compooml  . For instance , this default will be used also when translating ' Umwelt problcme'to'ecological problems ' or ' Umwelt reserven ' to'ecological reserve '  ( and not inappropriately to'ecology prob-lems/r ' eserve ~  . The use of such defaults enables us to increase the coverage of the statistical method and treat infrequent compounds of the target language  . 
Another important purpose for using default constructions for single words is to save storage space  . 
Without defaults , we would have to store in our statistical data base the most frequent construction h > r every specific compound whir:it occurs in the training corpus a significant number of tbnes  . This might require too much space wltcn training the system on the very large corpora which are necessary to get high coverage and precision of the method  . Ontile other hand , if we store the default constructions for sin-gl c words  , then we should store specific compounds , i . e . comhinations of words , only when the preferred construction for these comhinations conflicts with the defaults for single words  . 
This leads to the following implementation scheme : During the training phase  , the ( tagged ) corpus will be processed twice . In the first pass , the default constructions for single words will hc collected  . In the second pass , all the specific compmmds will be identified , but only those which conflict with the default constructions will be stored in an exception list  . 
When translating a new German compound ( during the actual translation phase )  , the exception list will first be consulted to check whether one of its items matches one of the possible alternatives for translation  . Only if there is no relevant item , the dc faults for the single constituents will be used  . 
I . I . 2 Se lec t ing the Target Lexcmes We relate to the problem of selecting the appropriate target words lot the constituents of the compound ACRESDE  COTING-92  , NANTES , 2328 AOt ~ T1992I252 PROC . OFCOLING-92 . NANTES . AUG .  2328 , 1992 as a special case of the prnl ) lem of target word selec ( ion in machine translation ( which itself is a variant of lexical disamblguation  )  . As such , these ambig0i-ties wilthetreated by the general method deserihud in\[Dagan et al  1991\]  , which uses statistical data on lexlcal cooccurrcnce within specific syntactic relations in a target language corpus  . 
Consider the folh ) wlng example given for illustration . The German ( : o~tq ) ound ' Re\]orm prozefl ' ( re-/orm process ' ) has in principle 9 possible translations . There are three possible English constructions ,   '1101111 flor in I noun of not at noun rs not nI~n ( I three t ) osslbh ~ translations for the word ' Prozefl ' , ' process ' , ' case ' and ' trial ' . Out of these 9 alternatives , the c ( mlt ) ound're\]orm process'occurs 5 tintes in the first half of The Washington Post corpus  , while all the other alternatives ( ' process of reform ' , ' caseo\]re-\]orm ' , ' reform case ' etc . ) never occur . Using ( best : statistics , the algorithm described in\[\]) agan et al1 . 1 t91\] selects ' reJorm process ' as the preferred translation  . It should bcnoted that the info ~ r\[tation which is used for lexical disambiguation may come fi'om ei-tlter within the compound  , as in this example , or fron , the surrounding context , such as using the verb which interacts with the compound  . 
4 Conclusions
This paper demonstrates that the translation of noun compounds i a difficult task  . llavlng German ms the source language adds the problem of segmenting the compound into its constituents  , aprol ) let n which does not exist in many o ( her languages . The solution for these problem seems to require varlo as levels of informarion  , involving morphological , syntactic , semantic and stylistic criteria . 
Though these levels are general for\[:very natural language processing task  , WE have shown how a detailed analysis of the specific linguistic\[  ) hell or neu~t can lead to an ellicient hybrid architectnre which uses the partial information availal decomputationally  . This architecture con , 1) in esformal syntactic and mn rpl to logl cal rules , wherever they (: an hespe(:ified accurately , with empirical data whicl l reltects sorer : or the semantic and stylistic considerations  . In this sense , this paper promotes the integration of the sometimes diverging streams  , natnely the use of syln-hollo , manually stipulated linguistic ruk:s versus the use of statistical data which is extracted all toln at-ically from corpora  , ht our view , these two disciplines complement each other and are both esscn tlal to a ehleve high performance in practical natural \] angllage processing systems  .
