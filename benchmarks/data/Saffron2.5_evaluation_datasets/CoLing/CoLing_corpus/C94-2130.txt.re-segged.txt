Abstract
We present an analysis of Dutch cross serial dependencies in Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar  ( \[ P&S ( 1994 ) \] )  . W c start out from the assumption that causative and perceptual verbs  , like auxiliaries , can lexically ' raise ' the arguments of the nonfinite verbs they govern to their own list of arguments through " argument composition "  ( \[ H&N ( 1989 ) \] )  . 
1 Introduction
Dutch cross serial dependencies ( DCSDs ) , wellknown from (1) and (2) , still challenge computational linguistics for an efficient treatment  .

The construction is only licensed by members of two closed classes of verbs  , the class of perceptual verbs like zicn ( " see " )  , hoven (" hear ") and voelen (" feel ") , and the class of causative verbs like laten ( ' qet/make " ) and helpen ( " help " )  . In the analysis put forward here w cemphasize this lexical aspect of the phenomenon  ; in our analysis DCSDs are strictly tied to the subcategorization and semantics of perceptual and causative verbs  . We analyze them as verbs which select , apart from their subject , a nonfinite V-projection which denotes an event . More particularly , as is proposed for German auxiliaries in \[ H&N ( 1989 ) \] , they subcatego-*Sponsored by EC projects FJSI ' IHT  P5254   ( PLUS )  ,  \] , \] . ql ' Rrl'P 66 65 ( DANDELION ) and two travel grants by the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research  ( NWO )  .

Errors are , of course , completely my own . 
rize for the arguments of the verb they govern , a mechanism frequently referred to as argument composition or argument inheritance  . 
Recently DCSDs have been analyzed in a nonstandard version of tIPSG  1 in\[P ~ eape ( fc . )\] . In his so called sequence union approach , the standard concept of phrase structure grammar ( i . e . that a string is defined as the terminal yield of a phrase structure tree  ) is abandoned . Our analysis is more standard , in the sense that we only need to refer to the lexicon and the HPSG-mechanism of structure  sharing3 Our preferred explanatory mechanism , argument composition , is not so much an additional mechanism as an effect which derives from careful specification of structure sharing  , and structure sharing is already at the theoretical core of HPSG  . 
Furthermore , argument composition is independently motivated , because Dutch is like German with rcspect to the phrase-structural behaviour of auxiliaries  , and argument composition in German constructions with auxiliaries is well-motivated  ( \[ H&N ( 1989 ) \] )  . 
So we have good reason to assume argument composition present in the theory  , regardless of DCSDs . 
2 Event Semantics in HPSG
The choice of semantics in terms of a theory of events  , known from \[ Davidson (1967)\] , offers interesting advantages and explanations of logical and linguistic phe-uomena  , motivating t t , e development of a constraint-based version of it  . 3 So , in the spirit of event semantics we propose that main verbs like voeren  ( " feed ' ) in ( 3 ) should denote a discourse referent , which is in fact a very natural assumption . In (3) and throughout the paper , recurring \[-~' s indicate structure sharing , that is token-identity of information , as is common us-agc in HPSG . Note also that we follow \[ Borsley ( 1987 ) \] in representing subjects as values of SlJB3 and follow \[ P&S ( 1994 ) \]  ( chapter 9 ) in representing nonsubject 1 Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar , which the reader is p .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   . d to b .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   . less familiar with ( see\[P&S (1994)\]) . 
2In fact our analysis differs from many previous analyses of DCSDs in that we do not refer to any ' additional '  ( often powerful ) mechanisms ( equence union , head wrapping , repeated rightward head movement ) .

This verbal complex then locally selects the sum of the arguments of the verbs which constitute it  . We fecl that a binary branching analysis is empirically motivated by a uziliary flip in the same way as auxiliary flip motivates a binary right-branching structure for the German verbal complex  , following \[ H&N (1989)\] .

A governing auxiliary will apply argument composition and raise all the complements from the governed verb  ( s ) to become arguments of the auxiliary , as proposed in \[ H&N (1989)\] . We assume that causative and perceptuM verbs syntactically behave just like auxiliaries in this respect  . 
Tile difference between auxiliaries on the one hand and perceptual and causative verbs on the other we view as basically semantic  . We take it that auxiliaries semantically more or less operate on events  , affecting features for tense and aspect or modality  . Causative and perceptual verbs on the other hand will be analyzed as events themselves  , events which take other events as their argument ~ in general as a theme  ( viz , avalne of AIt ( ~ , cf . the entry in (7) below ) . 
htchapter 9 of \[ P&S ( 1994 ) \] the approach to local se--lection from \[ Borsley  ( 1987 ) \] is developed fltrther and leads to the Valence t  ) rinciple , which refers to the valence features SiJI-~d and C  ( )MPS through ' F ': ( 4 ) Valence Prineiph , Chapter 9 , \[P&S (1994)\] In a headed phrase , h ) reach valence featn reF , the t , ' w due of the head daughter is the con- . 
catenation of the phrase's F value with the list of SYNSI  , ; M values of t t , eF-daughters ' value . 
The general effect of the principle on a phrase which is headed by some sign is that this headed sign can only become ' complete '  ( or " saturated ' ) if it is combined with the appropriate arguments . For example , in the case of a transitive verb , such a verb must find a subject NP ( selected through Sl ; B . /) and someoh . 
ject ( selected through (: () Ml'S ) . If we assume a lint clause structure analysis of Dutch and we furthenm  ) reassume lcxical signs like ( 3 ) and ( 7 )  , then the imme ~ diate dominance statements ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) will suffice to describe tilt : constructim , of Dutch we are concerned with here . r  Here the H , S and C indicate that the daughters of the phrase include a head  , a subject and complements , not necessarily in that order ( eft chapter 9 of \[ P&S ( 1994 ) \] for details )  . Note that in addition to the wdency features uJLI and COMPS  , we also assume the t ) resence of the G ( ) V-feature , ranging over 1 complement : S(5) XP\[ll , : x-q-~S , C1 ,  . ., C=,lI\[<ov (), u : xt \] (6) XiH . : xI\]~II\[( , w((:~) ,   , , , ,:?+\]  , Ci ' Phe seconds chentais in a sense not a " phrase " structure schema but is instead a " cluster-formation'-schema  . This is because normally the combination of two or more words leads to a sign which is I  , I . ; x- , a phrasal sign , but here it leads to a ' complex word ' which is I  , \] , ; XF . Also ( 6 ) is strictly binary : it takes one argument , namely the argument which is the value of fActually  , our analysis also presupposes the II ead Featm'e Principle and Semantics Principle from \[ P &S  ( 1994 ) \] ; cf . Figures 1 and 2 for informal illustration .

COY . We arrange the lexicon so that any value of coy will always be an unsaturated baseform verb which is defined as LEX + as well  . By the Valency Principle , this selection requirement of the governing verb will be appropriately ' cancelled ' after string concatenation during parsing  . 
Central to our analysis of the case-markings of NPs in the Dutch Mittelfeld is the assumption from\[Pollard  ( fc . )\] that base forms of verbs do not assign any case to their subject  . The value for the subject-NP's CASE-feature in ( 3 )  , " c ^ s ~" , is the supertype in the type hierarchy for those atomic types that are appropriate values of the feature CASE  . So , the value cast . " is the supertype of NOM and Acein Dutch and English  , and in German also of DA'r and G~N . The result of assigning the subject-NP this supertype for case in practice bolls down to giving this NP some kind of " any "- value for case  ; the case-value CASE of such an NP will unify with any other possible case value  . 
In our analysis , the discontinuous relation between arguments and verbs in DCSDs is brought about firstly by lexically defining finite per eeptuals like zag  ( and finite causatives ) as argument composition verbs , along the following lines : 9 ( 7 ) PHON ( ~ o ~ ) \[ MAJOR ~\]

The finite argument composition verb zag selects a singular nominative NP through its suBJ -feature  . As non subject arguments it selects through its COMPS-feature first the NP tagged as \[\] which is unified with the SUBJ-value of the governed verb  ( s )  , and secondly the list\[~\] of zero or more non subject arguments of the governed verb  ( s )  . And crucially , being a governing verb , zag selects through covagoverned baseform verb  , 1 ? with as SUBJ-value "\[ ~' , as COMPS-value 9In this entry and throughout the paper , @stands for concatenation of arbitrary-length lists of arguments  . 
1 ? One baseform verb , or a baseform verb-headed verbal clus-"\[~2' and as semantics "\[\]' . Note that , since the governed v\[nsi . :\] is selected as missing a subject and a list of complements  , it must not ' find ' this subject or these complements  , which it indeed doesn't ( cf . the tree in
Figure 1).
As it were in passing , the governing perceptual verb ( or causative verbalike ) imposes accusative case on the NP which denotes the suloject-argument of the governed verb  . The unification of \[ CASECASK \] and\[CASE Acc\]will be forced through the structure -sharing indicated in  ( 7 ) as "\[\]' , and will result in the more specific restriction \[ CASE  , cc\] . This accounts for the accusative case-marking on hasp  ( " her " ) in examples ( 1 ) and ( 2 )  , and in general on all non subject arguments in such constructions  . 
The second and crucial step in our account of the discontinuity is accounting for the linear order in the verb cluster with DCSDs  . The linear order of the verb cluster in Dutch we account for through  ( 8 ) :  ( 8 ) Linear Precedencel = tule Dutch Verb Clusters\[c ~ ov  ( x ) \]< x ( 9 ) Linear Precedence Rule German Verb Clusters
X <\[(~ ov(x)\]
By these LP-rnles , in each part of the binary branching verb cluster the governing verb will appear head-initial in Dutch  , and head-final in German . n It is straightforward to show that the above approach has the desired effect also for the sentence  ( 2 ) mentioned in the introduction if we define a lexical entry for the causative helpen with a syntax and semantics along the same lines as the perceptual zag  . The only difference must be that such nonfinite entries do not assign NOM to their subject  , but " CAS l . :" . Other than that , there will just be additional embeddings in the semantics as well as in the verb cluster  . Thus , by the ID-rule in ( 6 ) and the lexical entries for causatives and perceptuals  , we account for the recursiveness of the phenomenon  , cf . the tree in Figure 2 . 
4 Conclusion
We extended the \[ H&N ( 1989 ) \]- analysis of German to Dutch , accounting for the difference , resp . nested vs . cross serial dependencies , through one single LP-parameter . Also , we argued that such an argument composition approach is to be preferred over several alternative approaches  , ince argument composition is-n't an ' additional ' mechanism  . Further linguistic advantages of this approach , i . e . accounts of irregular case assignments and constraints on double infinitives  , are discussed in \[ Rentier (1994)\] . We are able to derive verb second constructions by standard application ofter  ; due to the ID-schema in ( 6 ) either will be LEX-\[- , so that we are able to recltr sively build up bigger and bigger LEX+-complexes  . 
uLP-rules like these are common in HPSG , cf . for instance the rule XP < SUBJ ( XP ) which orders subjects before VPs in English ( \[Borsley ( 1987 ) \] )  .
