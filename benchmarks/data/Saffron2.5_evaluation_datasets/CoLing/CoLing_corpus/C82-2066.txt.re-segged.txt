The proposed paper describes a non-go in6 research pro-~eot being carried out bysta ff and students at the Centre for Computat ional Linguistics to design a  . limited-syntax controlled-vocabulary machine translation system of sophistic- a ted design to run on  . a micro processor . 
1t . Background
Bedeis essentially a research project : we are not immediately concerned with commercial applications  , thoue k such are clearly p~ssible if the research proves fruitful  . 
Work on Bede at this stage thoue his primar ily experimental  . 
The aim at the moment is to investigate the extent to which a microprocessor-based ~  . T . system of advanced design is possible , and the limitations that have to be imposed in order to  . achieve a work in 8 system . This paper describes the overall system des ign specification to which ~ are current ly work in e  . 
In the basic design of the system we attempt to incor-porate as much as possible features of large-scale ~  . T ? sys-tems that have proved to be desirab leoreffective  . Thus , Beds is multllingual by design ( i . e . not based on language pairs ) ( of . King ,  1981:12 ) ! algorithms and linguistic data are strictly separated  ( of . Johnson ,  1979:140) ; and the system is designed in more or less independent modules  ( of ? Vauquols ,  1965:33 )  ? -  266 -The micro processor environment means that oz ~Lteria of size are important : data struc ture both dynamic  ( created by and maz~pulated during the transla tion process  ) and static ( dictionaries and linguistic rule packages  ) are constrained to be as economical in terms of storage space and access procedures as possib le  , Limitations on in-core and peripherals to rage are important considerations in the system design  . 
In large ~ eneral purpose M . T . systems , it is necessary to assume that failure to t ranslate given input correctly is general ly not due to incozTectly formed input  , but to insuff-iciently elaborated trans lation algorithms  . This is particul-arly due to two problems : the lexical problem of choice of ~ ppropriate translation equivalents  , and the strate ~ c problem of effective an a lysis of the wider~e of syntactic patterns found in natural langu~e  . The reduction of these problems via the not ions of controlled vocabulary and restric tede ~ rntax seem particularly appropz ~ ate in the micro processor environ-ment  , since the alternative of making a system in finitely extendable is probably not feasib le  . Both notions have been tried w~th bigger systems  , resulting both in better results from the M  . T . system itself , and in increased leF ~ L bility from a human po int of view of source texts  ( cf . Ducro % , 1972 ! Elli-et on , 1978! Lawson , 1979"81-21 So~ners and McNaught ,  1980:49)  . 
Given these constraints , it seems feasible to achieve translation v iaan " interling us "  ( cf . Veillon , 1969 ! Hutchiz ~ s , 1978 z 131) , in which the canonical structures from the sourcelan & n~a~e = are mapped directly onto those of the target  lan4gaa-ge  ( s )   , avoiding any langua ~ e-pe ~ iroriented " trans fer "  ste4~e  . 
~= ranslation thus takes place in two phases = an a lysis of source text and synthesis of target text  . 
2 t Brief description
A description of the system forms the second ha lf of the proposed paper  . For the sake of clarity and brevity in- 267 -this summary , we refer to the attached schematic represent at -ion of the translation process in Bede  . In the full version o ~ this paper , each step is to be outlined in rather more detail  . 
The analyser uses a chart-like structure ( of . Kaplan ,  1973 ) to produce the interface trees of the abstract interlingual representation  . These trees serve as input to synthesis , where they are reaz Tan~ed into valid surface structur-es for the target ~ age  . 
The source text is translated sentence by sentence  ( or equivalent )   . Text is firsts . ubJeoted to a two-sta ~ emorpholog-ical analys is  . In the first stage the text is compared word by word with a stop-list of frequent ly occurring words  ( most-ly function words ) ! words not found in the stop-list undergo morphological analysis  , again on a word by word basis . Morpho-logical rules form a finlte-state grammar of affix-strlpping rules  ( ? A rules ' ) and the output is a chart with labelled arcs indicating lexical item and possible interpretation of stripped affixes  , as confirmed by dictionary lookup . The morphological analysis phase also creates a temporary " sent-enced lctionary ~ consist in ~ of copies of the dictionary entr-ies for  ( only ) those lexical items found in the current trans lation unit  . 
The chart then undergoes a two-sta ~ eeyntacti co~semant-ioan ~ ysis  . In the first stage , context-sensitive phrase--structurer u les  ( " E rules " ) work towards creating a single arc spanning the entire translation unit-arcs are labelled with appropriate syntactic c lass and syntactico-semantic feature information and a trace of the lower arcs which have been subsumed  . In the second stage , the tree structure implied by the labels and traces on the searcs is disjoined from the ~ aph and undergoes general tree-to-tree-transduction rules  ( " Tz~les ' ) resulting in a single tree structure representing the canonical form of the translation uni t  . With source-language lexical items replaced by unique multilingual-dictionary j  -268 -addresses , this is the interl in6ua which is passed for syn-thesis into the ta rget language  ( s )   . 
Synthesis consists of a combination of Tru les which re-assign new order and structure to the lnterlingua  , and of context-sensitive rules which can be used to assign mainly syn-tactic feature labels to leaves  ( " L rule ~ )   , for example for the purpose of assigning number and gender concord  ( etc .  )  . The resulting list of labelled leaves ( the superi ~ or branches are no longer needed ) is passed to morphological synthesis where a finite-state gr smmar of morphographen Llc and affixation rules produces the target string  . 
As can be seen , the system is strictly modular , and at each interface only a small part of the data structures used by the donating module is required by the receiving module  . 
The " unwanted " data structures are writ ten to peripheral store to enable recovery of partial structures in the case of fail -ureor mistranslation  , though automatic back-tracking to previous modules by the system as such is not envisaged as a major component  . 
The " static " data Used by the system consist of the different sets of l in Eulstiorule packages  , plus the dictionary . The system essentially has one large multillngual dictionary from which numerous software packages generate various subdlctionarles as required either in the translation process itself  , or for lexloographers working on the system . Alpha-betio alorother structured language -specifl clistings can be produced  , while of course dictionary updating and editing pack ~ es are also provided  . 
~ Implementation details
The system will run on any micro processor system which runs under the CP/M operating system and at C  . 0 . L . is implem-ented on the Intertec Superbrain with twin ~' double density floppy disk drives  , giving a total of 320k bytes of on-llne- 269 -store . Programs are written in Pascal/M(Scrod ,  1979)  , a Pascal dialect closely resembli ~ UCSDP ascal .
