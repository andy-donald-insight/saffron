It has become apparent to some dialecto lo6 ists that di~lectol-ogy , particularly in its interpretive phase , is a branch of linguistics particularly adapted to the use of computers  . The dialectol0-gist typically deals with large bodies of data , usually in the form of single words and short phrases  , and he is interested in sorting and comparing individual items on many bases : phonological  , morphological , lexlcal , and geographical . The major obstacle that has prevented widespread use of computers in dialect study is the fact that the data for most of the great dialect surveys have been collec-Ited  , recorded , and in most cases edited prior to the computer age  . 
Thus the problem of preparing large bodies of data  , much of it in narrow phonetic transcription , for computer use has been formidable . 
One of the aims of the present paper is to show that results can be obtained relatively easily by computerized sorting and mapping that would take endless hours by traditional methods  , and hopefully to encourage others to invest time and money in preparing data for the computer rather than in time-cc~suming hands orting and map-making  . 
Accordingly we sought a proble ~ I that would be can plex enough to reveal the advantages of computerized dialectolo ~ y while at the same S ince two of the three  , authors are specialists in English ( the third is a computer specialist )   , we ~ tural/y~urned to the published volumes of the  5 ' u~e~d of~dZ'~hD~a/~c ~ , 2 which embody carefully controlled data , collected with professional skill , and presented in convenient tabular form in met iculously edited and printed volumes  . 
And sinceune of the two areas covered by the volumes in print at the time the study was ~ a der taken  ( May 1969 ) was the south of England , the problem of the voicing of initial fricatives in the southwest naturally suggested itself  . Thisly rohlem had the further advs ~ tage , for our purposes , of dea//ng with cm~sonants ( sinkier than vowels in most varieties of English  ) in/D / tial position , hence easily sorted and exsmined . The selection of this proble~has proved to be a happy one  . 
The area covered by Volume ~ of SED comprises the tens outher n-most counties of England  , which , with their key numbers in the S~w ; ey , are 31 Somersetshire , 32 Wiltshire , 33 Berkshire , 3 ~ Surrey , 35 Kent , 36 Cornwall , 37 Devonshire , 38 Dorsetshire , 39 Hampshire , and h0 Sussex . A : ~" ~ i of 75 localities in this area were reported os by the Su~ey  ; in what follows these will be identified by a four-digitr number  , the first two digits indicating the county and the remaining two the locality  . Thus 3906 stands for Burley , the sixth locality listed in hamps hire , accordi ~ to the numbered list on p . 31 of the Introduction to the 8ul-oey . The data selected for examination followed by a vowel or voiced consonant which were starred in the ~ ED questionnaire  .   3 To this list we later added a few non-starred words which showed universal distribution and were otherwise of interest  . The final list contained 68 words , of which 27 are f-words , 22 s-words , 16 Sh-words and 3ah-words ( i . e . words beginning with /~/ in standard English ) . We took only the first recorded form from each locality  ; this is presumably a citation form , produced by 8n informant in response to a question , and recorded in narrow IPA transcription . The 59 cases where no response was given we recoded XXX in our computer code  . 
The corpus thus comprised 68x 75 or 5100 items , including the 59 blanks . Ourc ~ , puter expert then produced 68 decks of punch-cards , one for each word ~ each deck containing 75 cards , one for each locality , These were numbered at the left for locality and on the right for the reference number of the item in the SED questionnaire  . ~ A coding system was devised which preserved all significant features of the phonetic transcription while passing over apparently irrelevant fine points  ( see Appendix A )  , and the words were transcribed in this code directly onto the cards for the guidance of the key-puncher  , who then punched the coded words in a fixed place on the cards  . 
Subsequently the standard spelling was inserted by the computer to the left of the coded phonetic spelling  . This whole process took about a dozen hours of the investigators ' time  ( not counting the relatively simple progras~ing involved  ) and about the same amount of the key-puncher's time  . The result was a body of data consisting of 5100 entries of the following sort : 3101 FINGERFIgG ) R .   6   7   7 This is to be interpreted as indicating that at locality  3101   ( Weston in Somerset ) the word f~nger , which appears as item VI . 7 . 7 of the SED questionnaire , is pronounced\[f , ngar-\] ( or perhaps more accurately/ftngar-/in the quasi-phonemic transcription used  )  . 
The nature of the problem with which we are dealing ms ~ be most simply introduced by an excerp tfrc ~ the full treatment given to the voicing of initial fricatives in Middle English by Horn and Lehnert  ( 195~ , Vol . If ,  ~37 ) : Ingewissen Mnndartensind in alter Zeitim Wortanlaut diestarken und stimmlosen Reibelaute f  , sund ~ vor Vokalen und schwachen , stimm haften Konsonanten schwachund stimm haft gew0rden : f-?v- , s -> z - ,  ~- ? 6-  .   .   .

Horn-Lehnert go onto point out that by analogy and under the influence of Standard English  , initial f - and s-in French loan words have become voiced  . This is borne out in our corpus by the words ~ , ~Grmer , and ~ ers , which have initial v-in more than half the localities included  . As our subsequent discussion and maps will show , Horn-Lehnert should have included in the initial voiced fricative area the western half of Hampshire and all but the southwest tip of Cornwall  . Since the SED records for He refords hire and Gloucester-shire have not yet been published  , we have not been able to include these counties in our survey  . 
The traditional assumptions , then , are that ~- , s-j and ~- . 
bee~nevoiced ( except before voiceless consonants ) in initial posi-tionata nearly date- -certainly before the  13th century -- in the southeast ; that this affected all native words ; that this change subsequently spread into the old West Saxon area of the southwest  ; that southeast ; and that analogy , dialect borrowing , and the influence of standard English worked variously to blur the exceptic mless charac-ter of the sound change  , to produce voicing of initial 2- and a-in French loan words and of initial ~- in native words like  8hiZlir ~ as well as French words like sure , and othe`se to create a mixed situation in the whole southern area  .   5 Our project was to see what light the records of the SED can throw on this situation by exploiting them in some of the many ways made possible by computer techno-logy  . 
The first step was to sort the data in as many ways as we felt would be productive  . Accordingly our computer expert produced four lists of the  5100 items , sorted as follows : List I:s orted first by keyword  ( the standard English graphic word identifying the item  ) alphabetically ; then by locality . 
This list presents the data in the same kind of order in which it appears in the SED records and allows easy inspection of all versions of each word in one list  . 
List II : sorted first by locality and than by keyword alphabet-ically  . ' Fa is list brings together in one place all the records from each locality and thus permits comparison of the  8mount of voicing recorded fr~n various localities . 
List Ill : sorted first by locality and then by citation  ( the recorded local form ) alphanumerically . This list even more graphically reveals the- mount of initial voicing  ; it also makes it easy to surmise from inspection whether or not incidence of initial voicing might be influenced by the following vowel or cG~Is on sIlt  . 
List IV : sorted first on the second and following characters of the citation form  , in linguistically significant order ( i . e . by vowels and consonants in articulatory order ) , then by the first character . This list greatly facilitates looking into the question of the possible influence of following sounds on initial voicing  . 
These lists , though interesting in themselves , we recmm~idered primarily as intermediate diagnosti ~ procedures  , to be used to guide us in future ~ ortlng , counting , and eventually mapping . Even the most cursory in speetiou of them revealed what we had suspected frc ~ our first look at the data : that there is tremendous variatio ~ within the relevant are a both from word to word and from locality to local-ity  . It ~ ertainly seemed , at least so far as this feature in this region is concerned  , that the maxim attributed to Gilli ~ ron , " Every word has its own history , " is true . 
Accordingly we asked our c~n puter expert for various more soph-isticated sortings and counts  , and for two kinds of maps , to be produced by the CalCump plotter ( see Appendix B )  . These were the following : i . A table for each of the four sets of words , listing all words in the set and counting the number of each occn rrf ~ initial consonant  , the words to be ranked in descending order of then ~ ber of initial voiced consonants recorded  . ~ ese are reproduced here as
Tablesi-4.
2 . A list of all possible ~ vowels , dipht~s , and second conson-ants in each set of words , counted and tabulated in terms of each possible initial consonant  . A portion of this list is reproduced here with as Table  5  . 
3 . An individual map for each of the 68 words , showing the initial consonant recorded for each locality  . Eight of these are reproduced here as Maps 613 . 
4 . Four proportional maps , one for each set of words , indica-ting at each locality the voiceless : voiced ratios  ; thus for the ~ h-words the legend 3/13 occurring at B905 indicates that at that locality only three of the  16 d-words begin with voiceless consau-ants . Map I shows the proportianal map for the e-words as it came from the plotter  , while maps derived frc ~ these proportional maps to reveal the varyiug distributions more clearly are included as Maps  2   -5   . 
Tablesi-~s ~ pportour suspicion that each word has its own unique distribution with regard to the initial c~nsonant  . Thus Table 1 u hows that ~ the f-words the proportion of voiceless to voiced ranges fr ~  20:5~ in F  ~ . LT ~ to 52:22 in FOAL . Even in those cases vhere the proportions are the same  , recourse to List I~eveals ~ hat

Thus items 5  -  7 on the table all have a voiceless-voiced ratio of  30:45  , but the voiceless localities , at least in the area to the west of the major is o -gloss to be described below  , are not the same . FERN ( see Map 13) is voiceless at 3102 ,  3604 ,  3902 , and 3907 and voiced at 3405 and h003~ FINGER is voiceless at 3405  ,  3902~ 3907 , and 4003 and voiced at 3102 and 3604 ; FIRE is voiceless at 3102 ,  3405 ,  3604 , and 4003 , and voiced at 3902 and 3907 . In tabular form:
FER NF VF FFV .
FINGER VF ~ VFFF
FIRE FFF VVF
The same kind of discrepancy is shown by items 9 - ii , with 33:42 ratio , and items 12-14 , with 34:41 . 
Tablei also shows that neither etymology nor following consonant seems to affect the distribution markedly  . The three French words , FLOUR , FAR MER , and FLOWERS , appear in the middle of the list , with ratios of 35:40 ,  37:38 , and 39:36 respectively . The words with initial ~- are also in the middle , ranging from FLEAS 33:42 to
FLOWERS 39:36.
The three last words on the list , with ratios 41:23 ,  52:22 , and 40:22 , all show some peculiarity in the recordings indicating that for many of the informants they were unfamiliar  , learned , or bookish words , hence more likely to have standard English pronunciation  . Thus FORD , the expected response to the question " Sometimes there is no bridge  ( over a rivule t )  . What do you call that shallow place where you can walk across ?"  ( SEDIV . 1 . 3) , was not known , not found , or not recorded in seven localities , replaced by a local term ( splash , sluice ) in four others , and given as a " suggested word " ( i . e . one pronounced first by the field worker ) in nine others . Though FOAL is recorded from all but one locality in answer to III  . ~ . l , it is revealed by the answers to another question  ( III . 4 . 6 ) that in many localities the preferred word is colt  . The records also show that FORKS ( the agricultural kind )  , not recorded from 13 localities , yields to ~ other preferred local words ( picks , prongs , spuds ) in many others . Likewise it has a mixed etymology , being derivable from Latin furca either through OE for caor Anglo-Norman four que  . 
At the top of the list two words , FELLIES and FURROW , show unusual distribution in that voiced forms extend well into the usually voiceless areas of Berkshire  , Sussex , and the tip of Cornwall ( see Maps 6 and 7) . FELLIES also shows six instances of the substitution of the dental fricative for the labial  , which otherwise occurs only in FRIDAY , and which is reversed in six occurrences of / v / in THATCH  . 
If these five words are set aside , the range of voiceless-voicediratios , from 28:~7 to 43:3~ much more closely resembles that of the th-words ( Table 3 )  , which range from 29:45 to 41:33 . 
Observations in similar detail can also be made on the basis of Tables  2  -  4  , but exigencies of space suggest a bridgement . 6 The

Zb_marked drop off invoiced forms in the last five words of Table  2 implies that , in contrast to initial ~- , the voicing of initial 8-is much reduced by a following nasal or / i / ( this will be discussed further below )  . Voicing is not to be expected before a voiceless consonant  ; we included STITCH because it shows one freak is h occurrence of initial\[z\]at  3901  . In this set the French words ~ SECOND , SUE~f , and SEXTON , do appear well down the list , with ratios of ~4:31 ,  ~5:30 , and 53:22 respectively . If the words of French origin and those with a consonant after the initial  8- are set aside , the remaining range of ratios , from 29:46 to 38:37 , comes much closer to that of the other sets . 
The th-words in Table 3 are , of course , all native words , since neither Norman nor Central French has had initial dental fricatives at any time when borrowing into English could occur  . Likewise the only consonant that occurs at all frequently after initial  /8/ or /~/ is/r / . Hence the range of ratios of the whole set is narrower than those of the f - and  8-words   . Noteworthy is the fact that throughout the voiced area  , the initial cluster /@ r / appears as / dr / , presumably as a result of a later change of /~/ to / d / in this environment  . 7 ( See Map8 for THRESH ) . This same change has occurred in THISTLE in western Somerset  , Devon , and Cornwall ( see Map9) , and in THATCH ( Mapi 0 ) in south Devon and eastern Cornwall . These two words also show initial/v / sporadically in Somerset and Dorset  , presumably a substitution the opposite of that occurring in FELLIES in five localities  .

One locality , 3805 ( Kingston , Dorset) , even has/v/in THISTLE and I~/in FELLIES . Why only two of the 16 % h-words should show this kind of substitutic ~ remains unexplained  . ~ here is certainly nothing in their etymology to account for it  . 
Table ~ lists the only three sh-words that show more than a few scattered instances of initial / ~ /" The other ~ tarred words of this sort  , with the number of occurrences of initial voicing for each  , are 8 heuf ~ , s~epi , she ~ f3 j8 hoe2 , and sh ~; eZ3 . Even the three words listed have a ratio characteristic of the low end of the other lists :   52:22 for SUGAR ( a French loan word )  , 57:18 for the native word " SHILLING , and 62:13 for another French word , SURE . Presumably the two French words hads c~ellhing like initial\[sJ-\]at the time of borrowing  , while 8~ILL~N ~ and the other native words had/s ~-/ until later OE  . Instances of voicing in these words is to be attributed wholly to analogy  , prest ~ ably with the s-words . As might be expected , the heaviest concentration of voiced forms is in the " hard-core " voicing areas in Devonshire and western Hampshire  ( see Map 5 )  , but there are scattered instances in Sc~ere et , Dorset , and Wilts . 
( see Mapii for SHILLING).
Just as Tablesi- 4 reveal the wide variety in voiceless-voiced ratio for individual words  , so Maps 2  -  5 show the same variety for individual localities . The sem~ps have been simplified from the orig in alcce ~ uter-produced proportional maps described above  , which were in the form shown in Map1 . Taken together , they de~nstrate isogloss on the eastern boundary of the voicing area  . This line start so ~ the coast east of P or tsmouth  , trends in an orthwesterly directic ~ across the middle of Hampshire  , follows the Wiltshire-Berkshire line for a short distance  , and then turns vest across northern Wiltsh ire toward the Cots wolds  . The plotting of its subsequent course must await the publication of the records fr ~ Glou-cestershire and Hereford  . It marks a sharp division quite diffe rent frem the grading noticeable within the voicing area  . At one point about tenmiles north of Winchester it passes between two local it i es  ( 3901 and 3902 ) showing respectively total voicing and total voice-lessness in the th-words  . A little to the north of this it separates two localities -- Burbage  , Wilts . , and Inkpen , Berks . -- which are only 8 miles a part and yet show voiceless voiced ratios of  @:16 and 15:1 respectively in the th-words . It is equally well marked for the other sets , though in the case of the f-words the ~ explicable eastern extension of voicing in two words -- FELLIESAND  FURR0W--creates the appearance of a transitional area ( Map 2 )  . 
The maps also show that the voicing did not extend to the southwest tip of Cornwall except in a few words  . Presumably the English brought into this formerly Celtic area was more strongly influenced by standard English  . The extreme case is represented by 3607 , which has voicing in only two of the 68 words : FELLIES and FURROW , which , as we have seen above also extend beyond the voicing area on the east  .

I~I different parts of the region . Just west of the main eastern is o-gloss is an area where voicing is virtually total for all sets of words  . The are a differs in size from one set to another , being larger for the f-and th-words than for the s-and sh-words  , but its heart is western Hampshire , Dorset , and part of southern Wiltshire . 
It is separated from the other area of almost total voicing in Devon-shire by a mixed area in Somerset and Wiltshire where the proportion of voicing among the words examined ranges from  25% to 75%  . 
Finally there are fringe areas in the east and in southern Cornwall where ~ lyafew of the words ~ those high on the lists in Tables  1 -h -- show voicing . In the light of the traditional historical view of a feature spreading west from Kent  , as ex~pressed in the quotation from Horn-Lehnert above  , this distribution is a bit puzzling . Full exploration of its implications must be postponed to a later study  . 
One possible explanation of the variation in the incidence of voicing from one word to another is to be sought in the influence of the sounds immediately following the initial fricative  . Chart I displm~vs some of the characteristics of the four sets with regard to to following phonemes  . The sh-words have far less initial voicing than the other sets  . No more thou 22 localities have initial voicing for any single word in this set  . On the other hand , the s-words dem-om Strate the wide strange : frc ~ voicing in  46 localities to a long tail of words with no initial voicing anywhere  . The most stable is i 3O This means that for all words but one in this set  , over half the localities have a voiced initial fricative  . This is the highest proportion for any set . 
The sound following the initial fricative has been indicated on 
Chart I in terms of three categories : + vowel ( unmarked ) + voiced consonant ( marked with square ) + voiceless consonant ( marked with dot ) There is a striking correlation between voiceless initial fricative and a following voiceless consonant in the s-words  ( no other set has a voiceless consonant in second position  )  . With the exception of spring ( 72:3 ) and STITCH ( 74:1 )  , the association is absolute for
Ik/school , scratch , sky , squirrel(s ) +/ p/spade , speak , spokes
It ~ stars , steal , stile , stool , straw 0nly STITCH has been included in the computation . 
Voiced consonants in second position of s-words also associate with initial/s/rather than/z /: ~/ w / SWRAT  ( 41:34 ~ SWEAR ( 52:23 ) J/n/S NO W ( 59:16 )  , SNObT(70:4) < s > +!

In the case of the other sets , however , there is no clear connection : < f > ? I r / THRESH  ( 31:~3 )  , THREE (33:42) , THREAD(36:39)/r/FRIDAY-I(29:46) , FRIDAY-2(28:44)

Table 6 shows that for f - , s - , and th-words , high and low front vowels/y , i ; ~/ and low central vowels/a , a/associate with initial voicing . For the three sets taken together the proportion of voiced initial fricatives occurring with these vowels following is between  60 and 63 percent .

A study of t~evalues for the individual sets reveals that initial voicing is particularly associated with high and low front vowels in f -words  ( 72% and 78% respectively ) and with low central vowels in 8- and th-words ( 77% and 83% )  .

Rounded high front vowels/Y , y/showed a more marked association with initial voicing than unrounded high front vowels/I  , i / . 
The ratios for all f-and s-words with rounded front vowels are : FOOT  @:16  ; SOOT1:15 , SUCK@:7 , SUET 1:15 . If we make a table for all the second vowels in SOOT  ( Map 12 )  , we get :
Central Back
Highi : 15@:i32:191:2Mid

There is , of course , a possibility here of pseudo-correlation , caused for instance by the possibility that those localities which have the fronted/Y/for standard English/U/in words like SOOT happen to be located in the area of strongest voicing  . Investigation of this possibility must a wait further study  . 
The tendency for high front vowels generally to cooccur with voiced initial fricatives is  , however , obvious in words like FERN ( Map 13 ) where no rounding is involved :
Front Central ~: ib
Mid@:230:21
Low@:6
Finally , to illustrate the difference in correlation with low central and low back vowels  , we may cite the figures for FORTY . The voiceless : voiced ratio with a low central vowel\[a  , a: , a , a:\] is 13:17 ~ while with a low back\[D , ~\] it is 27:18 . 
It is clear that even more study , of individual words and individual localities , is needed before all the complications of this one dialect feature can be unraveled  . We should , for example ~ take into account the second and third responses for many of the words ~ many of which were taken from incidental conversation and hence are inclined to be more natural  . Even casual inspection of the data indicates that they show a much higher incidence of initial voicing than do the citation forms  . But we hope that this paper has shown that , given adequate and convenient data , the computer can be of inestimable aid to the dialectologist  .

Field workers were instructed to obtain them at all costs  , even if they had to suggest the word and ask the informant to pronounce it  . In most cases words were chosen , that have universal distribution in the d ialects  , but occasionally a word thought to be common turned out to be unfamiliar or even unknown  , as in the case of FORKS , FORD , end FLITCH in our corpus .

5 For an alt ~ rn~ive theory , holding that initial fricatives were already voiced in the language of the Jutes and Frisians who settled Kent  , see Bennett 1955 in Bibliography .

When it was first decided to produced ia lect maps by computer  , several methods were discussed . Output could be intricately placed c ~ a printed page  , and then a map outline could be super imposed on that page by hand  . In this way we could achieve our basic goa l  , that of having the computer dethetedious task of sorting and tallying the linguis tic data to be displayed  , while leaving a minimum of work to the researcher  . But this idea was not pliable enough to let us represent a map as it actually is  . The squareness of the format and the constant d is tance between characters on the printed page made it impossible to reproduce any map w ith sufficient accuracy  . 
A second method discussed was to output the enti remap and data on a visual display unit such as a CRT scope  . Here we could draw the map , but our printing format was again too str ict  . This method also is expensive , since it requires the use of a non-line scope  . 
We finally decided upon an off-line plo tter  . The one we used was a CalCump #563 Digital Plotter . This machine takes a conputer tape which has been prodneed by a non-line computer program and draws the date in the tape on to a roll of paper  . In order to visual-ize how the plotter works  , imagine a set of coordinate axes with a y -axis about  12" long and an infinitely long x-axis . This grid is the piece of paper to heplotted on . The instructions to the plotter are simple . They boil down to two: , ~lower or raise the penpoint ( so it will or will not write as it moves ) and move the penin a straight line to location ( x , y ) on the grid . In this manner anything can be drawn , fr~straight lines to circles , letters , and numbers ( curves are actually made up of very short straight line segments  )  . 
The routines used to produce CalComptapes are FORTRAN subroutines  . It was therefore necessary to write a FORTRAN program whose input would be  ( i ) instructions for drawing the outline of a map and plotting localities within it  , and ( 2 ) linguistic data in a specially processed format . The output would be the tape which directs the p lotter  . 

Two methods were tried out for producing the map outline  . In the first , a transparent grid was placed over a map and coordinates of " bends " in the outline were recorded  . Thus a map would be produced by moving in a straight line from one bend to another  . The map produced by this method gave only a rough approximation of the original because we could not find a grid small enough to represent accurately all the bends and curves in the outline of the map  . The second method was much more successful . A digitizer was used to measure and record the coordinates of bonds in the outline and the positions of the localities within the area covered  . The digitizer ( ~sed by courtesy of the American Mathematical Society  , Providence , R . I . ) consists of a large table and a " bomb-sight " connected to a paper-tape punch  . The crosshairs of the bombsight are moved along the outline of the map  , and all coordinates are accurately measured and p~ched onto paper tape  . This paper tape then becomes the direct input to the computer  . Special codes were used to instruct the plo t-ter to lift the pen  ( to move away and drawan island , for example ) or to indicate that the next coordinates wou ld be the positions of localities on the map  . When the program was completed , the instruc-tions for drawing the outl in e of England and marking the coordinates of the  311 localities of the SurUey of EngZish D4uleot8 required about 4000 x and y measurements . \[For the present paper only the bottom quarter of the map  , with 75 localities , was used . \] The raw linguistic data was key punched onto cards using the phonetic coding discussed above  ( Appendix A )  . Also on the cards were the numbers of the county and locality and the keywords  . For example , the card for SUGAR , county 31 , locality ~ , was 310~SU~A~;%G ) R:5 .  8 . 1 0 f Since the corpus of data included 68 words for each of the 75 loc-alities in Southern England , the card input consisted of 5100 cards . 
These records could be sorted by phonetic word ( citation )  , by locality , by key ~ ord , or by any combination of these . 
4 2 the linguistic results which were to be drawn onto a map  . This output was then read in by the FORTRAN plo tting program  . The input to the plotting program was of as tandard format : MAP  NB~4BER   ; COUNTY ; LOCALITY ; NUMBER OF SYMBOL $ ; LINE NUMBER ; MESSAGE
For example , the card 3   33   5   7   3-F/I-V meant " on map #3 draw the seven characters 3-F/I-V at locality 5 incounty 33  . "" Line number " was used to produce the legend at the bottom of each map  . The legend was drawn whenever the county and locality numbers were @  . For example , the instruction 2  ~ ~  18 i INITIAL CONSONANTS meant " ~ map #2 write the above message at the position for line i of the legend  . " The input to the plotting program came in sorted by map number  . 
Whenever a new map number was read in ( meaning that all the data for the previous map had been plotted  )  , the program would issue instructions to move over on the plotting paper and draw a new map outline  . 
Data would then be drawn on this new map until a different one was requested  . Thus one run of each of the PL/I and FORTRAN programs could produce any number of related or even unrelated maps  . 
It should be apparent that the great virtues of this method of producing both working and finished dialectal maps are speed and accuracy  . Anyone who has produced even rough working maps by stamping or drawing symbols on an outline map knows how time-consuming and tedious this process is  , and how subject it is to error . The computer never wearies and never ( we trust l ) makes a n ~ error . As a result , the dialectologist can experiment with all kinds of working maps and select those which are interesting or significant  . 
This should add a new dimension to the study of linguistic geography  .
