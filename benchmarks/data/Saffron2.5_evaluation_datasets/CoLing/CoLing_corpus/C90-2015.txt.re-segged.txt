Introduction
This pal ~ ; r presents an analysis and synthesis of the factors relevant to the decision to use a cleft construction in discourse  . The model described , based on a corpus of 587 naturally-occurring cleft constructions in written and spoken discourse  , consists of two stages . The first stage concerus the decision to use a cleft construction rather than a non-cleft  ; the second describes the factors relevant in deciding between three types of cleft : it -clefts  , such as that in example (1) , wh-clefts , such as (2) , m ~ d reverse wh-clefts , such as (3): (1) It was the mango that Martinate . 
(2) What Martinate was the mango.
(3) The mango was what Martinate.
Below , we examine some previous explanations of the functions of clefts in discourse  , paying particular attention to the prevalent view that clefts of all kinds are ' focu  , ;ing ' constructions . Analysis of the corpus data reveals that this view does not stand up to closes crutiny : a more complex model of cleft function is required  , incorporating factors at more than one level of description  , if the unique function of clefts as an option for speakers and writers is to be properly understood  . " I qae paper shows how factors at the levels of syntax  , semantics , and pragmatics interact , and sketches how these factors might be synthesised in a decision procedure for generating cleft constructions in connected is course  . The work presented here appears in greater detail as a doctoral dissertation  ( Delin\[1989\] )  . 
As a terminological note , in what follows , their rune-diate complement of the cleft copula be  ( the mango , in each of the cleft examples above ) will be termed throughout the cleft HEAD . The clausal constituent ( that Martinate , or what Martinate ) in each case will be termed the cleft COMPLEMENT . The class of cleft constructions in general will often be referred to simply a  , ; CLEFTS ; the use of other terms will be made clear as and when they arise  . 
Previous Explanations of Cleft Function
In the literature on cleft constructions to date , three explanations of the function of clefts have gained currency  . These are as follows : Clefts provide a syntactic indication of the position of particular statuses of information  , such as ' Given " or " New ';
Clefts provide unique options for the presentation of information in a particular serial order  ; and Clefts are ' focusing ' constructions , indicating the position of information that is ' salieng in the discourse A detailed analysis of  150 of each of the cleft types , taken from the Survey of English Usage spoken data  ( Svartvik and Quirk\[1980\] )  , however , reveals that significant classes of counterexamples are available for all three explanations : the data is more varied than is often thought  . 
First of all , it can be demonstrated that clefts do not reliably indicate ' Given ' and ' New ' information in particular syntactic positions in the sentence  . That is , clefts neither contain Given information in the complement and New in the head  ( which we can term the STRONG version of this hypothesis  , adopted by Horn by \[1972\] , Havil and and Clark\[1974\] , Clarknd Clark\[1977\] inter alia ) , nor do they divide Given from New information in other syntactic ways  ( as the WEAK version of the hypothesis suggests , adopted by Prince\[1978\] , Geluykens\[1984\] , Quirk et al\[1985\] , and Cruttenden\[1986\] among others ) . 
Although definitions of ' Given ' and ' New ' information are not always easy to apply formally  , it is possible to obtain a formal approximation to Halli-day's  \[1967\] intended notion by applying the following criteria : On the basis of a formal representation  , New information is taken to be any argument , predicate , or eventuality ( state , 183 event or process , following Bach\[1986\] ) that appears explicitly in the represent a ~ tion of the sentence under analysis but not in that of the context  ; and The occurrence of a prosodic nucleus is taken to be corroborative evidence of the presence of New information  . 
The data showed , however , that neither the Strong nor the Weak hypothesis were upheld  . Counterex-amples to the strong version were clefts that contained one or more New elements in the complement :  90% of / t-clefts , 92% of wh-clefts , and 100% of reverse wh-clefts examined had this information arrangement  . The prevalence of such examples was confirmed by the fact that  41 it-clefts , 40 wh-clefts , and all of the reverse wh-clefts had one or more nuclear accents in the part of the sentence commonly though to convey " Given ' information  . The Weak version of the hypothesis requires that Given information is segregated syntactically from New information in some sense  . Counterexamples to this version , however , were a large group of clefts that contained some New information i both head and com-plernent :  60% of it-clefts , 92% of wh-clefts , and 14% of reverse wh-clefts . Again , as corroborative evidence , prosodic nuclei appeared in both head and complement of  25 it-clefts , 40 wh-clefts , and 4 reverse wh-clefts . 
The hypothesis that clefts provide unique options for the presentation finformation ia particular serial order has been suggested by Chafe  \[1976\]  , Werth \[1984\] and Geluykens \[1984\] among others . However , in the corpus examined it was frequently the case that a cleft would be used in a context where the corresponding declarative  , assuming that such a sentence were syntactically possible  , would have given an identical serial ordering . For example , the wh-cleft in ( 4a ) does not offer significantly different ordering options from the declarative in  ( 4b )  , yet the cleft was chosen ( capital letters indicate the constituent upon which a nuclear accent appears  ) :  ( 4 ) But I have no reason to believe he teaches linguistics  ( a )   . . . what he teaches i modern LANGUAGES ( b ) . . . he teaches modern LANGUAGES In addition , there were sentence types other than de -claratives  , uch as some instances of topicalisation , that allowed an information ordering the same as that of a clef to be achieved  . This means that serial ordering options , while not irrelevant as a consideration i in clefting  ( as we shall see below )  , do not suffice as an explanation of clefts as a group of constructions  , since the ordering options provided are not unique to clefts  . 
Finally , there exists in the literature a common assumption that clefts serve to ' focus ' an element appearing in a particular syntactic position  , on some definition of the term . Two particular definitions of focus can be taken as as examples : the computational notions of focus applied to cleft constn + ctions by Sidner  \[1979\] and Reichman \[1981  ,   198!5\] in their work on the resolution of pronominal naphora  , nd the sentence-accent related notions of focus suggested by Chafe\[  1976\]  , Creider \[1979\] and Quirketa I \[1985\] as explanations of clefts . Taking the computational notions first , Sidner \[1979:60\] and Reichman \[1985:75\] predic that some particular syntactic positions incleft constructions are more likely than others to denote the antecedent of a subsequent pronominal anaphor  . Sidner claims that he cleft is among a group of sentence types that ' make the recognition of focus easy  , since\[they\] . . . have the purpose of singling out one element from others '  , assuming that the ' singling out ' function is performed by the head of the cleft  ; while Reichman builds into her algorithm the principle that the cleft subject is assigned a " high focus'rating  . 
The corpus as a whole yielded 92 examples of anaphors that were coreferential with an antecedent somewhere in a cleft construction  . These antecedents , however , did not appear in the predicted positions more frequently than they did elsewhere  . The examples relevant o Sidner's prediction showed that it-clef the ads provided antecedents on  43% of the total occasions , with wh-clefts more successful at 78% and reverse wh-clefts much less so at 11%  . Reich-man's prediction was less successful still : cleft subjects acted as antecedents of subsequent pronouns in  43% of / t-clefts , 22% of wh-clefts , and 11% of reverse wh-clefts . While it is not in question that Sidner's and Reichman's algorithms do resolve anaphora  , it is not clear that the assumption that a particular syntactic position is more likely to denote a ' focus ' is likely to help to resolve anaphors encountered in naturally-occurring data  . 
Turning to the accent-related definitions of focus  , it can be demonstrated that the appearance of accents does not correlate reliably with the particular syntactic positions predicted to bear ' focal'information  . 
For example , Chafe and Creider suggest hat the head constituent of any cleft is focal  , focus being marked by a nuclear accent . In my corpus , however , only 10% of it-clefts , 8% of wh-clefts , and no reverse wh-clefts had a sole nucleus in this position  . For wh-clefts and it-clefts , a nucleus in both head and complement was frequent  ( cf . examples (5) and (6) below ) , while in reverse wh-clefts the popular position for nuclei was in the complement alone  , as in ( 7 ) :  ( 5 ) A : But have you go take tt le B : Well what I would USE is one of those little solid FUEL jobs  ( 6 ) A : Now where did I hear that from B : Probabyme was it-it was the day AFTER when IRANG  ( 7 ) We ' rebigenough to stand on our own two feet now and this is what Vincent said NO about  2   84 Quirk et al \[1985\] suggest that clefts will contain one accentually -marked focus in the head constituent  , and one in the complement . Although this is closer to the pattern shown in ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) above , there are still significant exceptions . Only 50% of it-clefts and 8% of reverse wh--cleft showed the required accent pattern  , ' with wh-clefts more successful at 80% . 
It seems therefore that accent and s3n~tax do not correlate in the way that would be required to support the view that cleft constructions indicate the position of an accentua Uy-marked focal element  . The assumption that such a correlation can be found can perhaps be accounted for in terms of a past overreliance on decontextualised xamples  , which tend to be read aloud with the default accentual pattern of a nucleus in head position and none elsewhere  . However , when looking at clefts in discourse , the assumption that there is a straightforward correlation between ac--cent  , syntax , and the infm3nation status ' focus ' is far too simple to explain the facts -- the large literature on accent placement in context  ( cf . Gussenhoven\[1983\] inter alia ) bears witness to this . It is clear that , if a focusing explanantion is to be found at all for clefts  , an alternative formulation of the notion is required  . 
As a general observation , one of the most marked shortcomings of the putative x planations of cleft constvoctions examined above is their tendency to consider only one level of description -- usually that of pragcnatics --- in accounting for discourse function  . 
It is plausible to suppose that , while clefts may well be differentiated from other sentence types at the level of pragmatics  , their use in discourse is likely to be influenced additionally by other factors ~ for example  , the well-understood semantic fact that clefts are presupposition-inducing Syntactic structures  . In what follows , an alternative view will be presented of how a range of factors at the levels of syntax  , semantics , and pragmatics combine to carve out a niche for clefts in the range of sentential syntactic structures available to speakers at any given point in a discourse  . The account of clefts will be formulated in two stages : factors that differentiate clefts from non-cleft constructions  , and factors that may plausibly serve to determine the choice between the three cleft types  . 
Diff ~ arentiating Clefts and Non-Clefts The hmction of clefts as a class of construction can be explained in terms of three factors  , some of which have been observed before in relation to clefts  , but not integrated in a complete picture of their function  . 
First , clefts of all kinds serve to indicate by means of their syntax the site of two statuses of propositional content : PRESUPPOSITION and ASSERTION  . The view of presupposition adopted here is a semantic one  , where presupposition is syntactically induced by particular structures  . The presupposition iduced by the cleft contains an existentially-quantified variable  , whose value is supplied by the asserted proposition  . The variable-containing presupposition is given as ex--pression P in the analysis of the cleft in example  ( 8 ) below , while the assertion is ~ ven as expression A . 
The notation is a linearised form of that used in Discourse Representation Theory  ( cf . Kamp\[1981\]) , with the addition of eventuality indices as arguments standing for the events  , states and processes cribed by the cleft : ( 8 ) It was the mango that Martinate . 
P:\[el,x,m\]ate(el,x,m)
A:Is1 , x , y\]be(s1 , x , y ) and mango ( y ) As suggested by van der S and t \[1988\] the presupposition serves the function in discourse of communicating to the hearer that a propositional ANTECEDENT needs to be found or constructed for the presupposed proposition  . Note that this view says nothing about heactual state of the discourse context : it does not suggest that the presupposed information has to be available to the hearer already at the time of encountering the presupposition  . It is therefore perfectly coherent to suggest thai : New information ap ? pears in the presupposed proposition : indeed  , as seen above in the discussion of the informations trucoture of clefts  , this is commonly the case . The appear ? ante of New information in presupposed form has been observed by Kartunnen  \[1974:191\] and Stalnaker \[1974\] in relation to presuppositional constructions in general  . 
The second factor involved in differentiating clefts and non-clefts is that clefts convey the fact that the instantiation of the variable in the presupposition is  UN1QUE or MAXIMAL with respect othe context . In the case of (8) , for example , there must be a unique set of objects currently in the discourse context such that Martinate them  . This is not a new observation ( cf . for example Atlas and Levinson\[1981\]) , but independ~ent mechanisms have always been advanced to explain it  . In fact , the requirement that the element denoted by the clef the admust be the totality of objects currently in the discourse context able to satisfy the variable is identical to a condition on the appropriate use of definite referring expressions -  . 
also presup Ix~sitional constructions , as noted by Hawkins\[1978\] . For example , the phrase the bishops must not be used as a referring expressions if there exists in the current context any element that satisfies the predicate bish op but is not intended to be in the set of referents specified by the phrase  . The same is true of the cleft ca ~: there must be no elements in the current context that satisfy the predicate at e heman go but that are outside the  ( singleton ) set specified by

The third relevant factor in determining the function of clefts is a pragmatic one  , namely that the instanta-tion of the variable in the presupposition must be NOVEL  . As van der Sandt\[1988\] has pointed out , examples of the following kind are unacceptable in both clefts and declaratives :  ( 9 ) // Johnwon and it was John who won . 
However ,   ( 10 ) is acceptable as a cleft : 385 ( 10 ) Ik new someone won , and Isaw John a moment ago , but I didn't know it was
John who won.
The distinction between (9) and (10) is that , while the participants in the event described by the cleft in each case  , and the nature of that event , may already be available in the discourse , only in the second case is the connection between the winning event and the winner a novel one  . This connection , which can in fact be characterised as that between the variable in the presupposition and its instantiation  , eeds to be informative for the cleft to be acceptable  . An important part of the function of clefts in general appears to be the highlighting of this connection  . 
Having outlined the three factors determining the function of clefts as a class of construction  , we can turn to ways of choosing between the three cleft types  . 
Choosing Between Clefts
The factors contributing to the differentiation i between the three cleft types are argued here to be as follows : The three cleft types provide different options for the serial ordering of information  ; Different constraints exist on the rela-I : ionships that can exist between the presupposed information borne by each cleft  , and the discourse context ; The clefts present different options for information structure in general  ; and Syntactic differences between the clefts serve to constrain how information can be divided up between presupposition and assertion in the three cleft types  . 
While none of these factors serve in isolation to explain the function of the cleft types  , in combination , and in addition to the functions claimed above to be general to clefts  , they are powerful determinants of syntactic hoice . 
First of all , the three types offer different options for the serial ordering of information  . One serial ordering constraint appears to be related to the way texts are processed psychologically : as Garnham et al\[  1982\] have shown , speakers may enhance ase of processing for the hearer by optimising REFERENTIAL CONTINUITY in the discourses they produce  . For example , the / t-cleft in ( 11 ) below may be preferred to the wh-cleft in ( 12 )  , because in ( 11 ) the order of in which important referents of the discourse are specified is the discontinuous rabbit-birthday-rabbit-birth-day  , while in ( 12 ) it is the continuous rabbit-rabbit-birthday -birth day:  ( 11 ) Kevin wants a rabbit , because it was a rabbit I got formy birthday . My birthday is in January . 
(12) Kevin wants a rabbit , because what I got formy birthday was a rabbit . My birthday is in January . 
Psychological research ( cf . Clark and Havil and \[1977\]) suggests , in addition , that speakers may also prefer not to postpone the presupposed part of the message  . 
This is because the presupposed part of the utterance may be the important part with respect to the embedding of information in memory  . In some case , ,~ , choice of a particular type of cleft would allow the bulk of information in the cleft head to postpone the presupposition unduly  , as might be the case in/t-clefts and reverse wh -clefts  . This leads to a prefereno ~ for the cleft in which the presupposed information is presented first m the wh-cleft--in cases where the non -presupposed information is lengthy  . This could a cocount for the preferability of the wh-cleft in  ( 13 ) over the / t-cleft in ( 14 ) for presenting the following content : ( 13 ) What I want to find is some formal thing I can use to follow the complex definitions of these feature structures  . 
(14 ) It's some formal thing I can use to follow the complex definitions of these feature structures that I want to find  . 
As a second eterminant of the choice between clefts  , it is possible to show on the basis of an analysis of the relationship between the presupposed proposition and the context hat the kinds of information that can appear as the presupposition of each of the three types of cleft are distinct  . As noted above , it is already wellknown that presuppositions defined in a fairly conventional sense need not consist of information that is currently available to the hearer  . In fact , it is clear that for clefts at least the status of the presupposed information with respect to context is more or less independent of whether it is presented as a presupposition  . 
The corpus reveals that clefts of all three types have different profiles with respect othe types of information that it is possible to convey as presupposition  . For example , wh-clefts cannot be use ( to presuppose information that is New in context , while it-clefts can . This produces a strong preference for the/t -cleft in  ( 15 b ) over the wh-cleft in ( 15 a ) below , for example : (15) A : Sue , this is Marta . 
( a ) B : #Hi ! What I stayed in when you were in the States was your fi at  . 
( b ) B : Hi ! It was your fiat I stayed in when you were in the States  . 

Other distinctions of this nature exist between the three cleft types  ( cf . Delin\[1989:178 ff for a full expo-sition ) . For example , inferrable relations of some kinds are unavailable to both/t-cleft and reverse wh-cleft presuppositions  , while Old information - that is , information that is currently available in context--appears very rarely in reverse wh-cleft presuppositions  . These tendencies , although not a suitable basis for rules about the information structure of clefts  , could form a . valid basis for a set of preference weightings to be used in the decision between the clef types in a given context  . 
In addition to the differences in the information status of presupposed information i the three cleft types  , the analysis of the corpus showed a more general pattern of distinctions in information structure  . Firstly , as Prince\[1978\] has observed , there appear to be two distinctive arrangements of information preferred for it-clefts : the most common has New information in the complement  , and Old or Inferrable in the head ; less common was a second pattern , with New information borne by the head constituent and Old or inferrable information i the complement  . These arrangements are comparable to Prince's informative presupposition and stressed-focus it -clefts respectively  . The most common pattern for wh-cleft , ; had Old or more usually inferrable information in the complement and New in the head  , while the pattern in all the reverse wh-clefts was an anaphoric  ( Old ) head and New or inferrable infor-marion borne in the complement  . As with the preferences for presupposition types noted above  , these factors could form the basis for weightings to be used in syntactic hoice  . 
The fourth factor distinguishing the clefts from one another is the different range of constituent types that can appear as clefthead in each case  , serving to constrain in different ways what can be conveyed by the cleft  . The full range of constraintsipresented in Delin  \[1989:55ff  \] ; to demonstrate briefly here , only wh-clefts are comfortable with bare infinitives as head:  ( 16 ) What Martin wanted to do was eat the mango . 
(17 ) *It was eat the mango that Martin wanted to do . 
(18) * E at the mango was what Martin wanted to do.
Similarly , only/t-clefts can take NP+not until as head : ( 19 ) It was not until three that she left . 
(20)* Not until three was when she left.
(21)* When she left was not until three.
Reverse wh-clefts are the only cleft type able to take pronominal it and which as head :  ( 22 ) This camera -- and it is what I need-is expensive . 
(23) This camera , which is what I need , is expensive . 
(24)* This camera -- and what I need is it . -- is expensive . 
(25)* This camera , what I need is which , is expensive . 
(26 ) * This camera -- and it is it that I need--is expensive  . 
(27)* This camera , it is which that I need , is expensive . 
Syntactic factors exist , therefore , that would serve to condition the choice between the three types of cleft  . 
Conclusion
Using the syntactic , semantic , and pragmatic factors discussed above it is possible to suggest in outline a twostage decision procedure for the generation of chfft constructions  . The first stage is concerned with determining whether to use a cleft  . Taking a given proposition to convey as content , he generator has first to determine the following : ? Is a variable-containing presupposition required ? Does the residue of content left over from presupposing constitute a suitable instantiation of the variable in the presupposition ?? Is that instantiation the maximal one possible in the context ?? Is the instantiation novel ? The second phase deals with the choice between the three cleft types  . On a ' generate-and-test ' approach to sentence generation  , the possible real i . ~ations of the arrangements of semantic ontent arrived at on the basis of the first stage of the process can be examined for the following features : ? Which are syntactically acceptable ? ? Which provides the optimum serial ordering of information ? Which places information of the appropriate type in the presupposed portion of the sentence ?? Which has appropriate over all  informa-5   87 tion structure ? It is predicted that the result of the above procedure may be no clefts at all  , or more than one . Eithere sult is acceptable , since it is clear that , just as it is not always appropriate to produce a cleft  , neither is it always the case that only one cleft is possible  . 
It is dear that the above suggestions are only a small step towards an implementable algorithm  . However , in the course of this paper I hope to have shown two things in particular : the importance of corpus-based descriptive work to underpin decision procedures for syntactic hoice  , and the importance of avoiding the assumption that syntactic hoice is a uniquely pragmatic  , or even a merely " stylistic ' , phenomenon .
