Their coment , structure and size crucially determines the applicability of these systems  , and still their development and maintenance is a serious bottleneck  . Taking into accountheen or mousamount of entries required for practical purposes  , manual modelling procedures are hardly practicable  . 
Much effort is therefore devoted to achieving a controlled automatic handling of these tasks  . 
Intiffs paper a proposal is made to use a meaning dictionary as a source of conceptual knowledge  , and to apply text understanding methods for processing this information  . These methods include the automatic acquisition of conceptual definitions from meaning paraphrases  , their transformation into a suitable representation for automatic processing  , and the automatic update of conceptual definitions by means of text analysis  . 
A meaning dictionary explains the use of natural language x pressions with respect to tile access they provide to world knowledge  . In principle , the kzlow-ledge accessed and thus represented in a meaning dictionary includes many of the different kinds of knowledge which are required for semantic information processing  ( i . e . " how nature works , practices , institutions , facts of nature , regularities , ways of doing "\[ Searle 80:227\]) . 
Current research work on extracting inlbrmation from machine-readable dictionaries  ( cf . e . g . \[Bris-coe/Copestake/Bogura ev90\] , \[ Walker/Zampolli/Calzolari88\] , \[Alshawi87\] , \[ Nakamura/Nagao88\] ) has mainly concentrated on semantic relationships of the vocabulary and has proposed methods for semiautomatic or partial extraction of this information  . 
These methods basically rely on syntactic structures of meaning paraphrases or database -like coded lea-tures and values  ( see also\[Briscoe/Copestake/Bogu-raev90\] )  . The task of acquiring conceptual information , however , laces the problem that his information in traditional meaning dictionaries is itself conveyed in terms of the means natural language provides for communicating conceptual information  , amely na-tural language texts ( meaning paraphrases , definitions , even longer explanatory texts or abbreviated textual or ms  )  . Thus understanding conceptual definitions of meaning dictionaries requires textual mechanisms to be recognized and handled in order to analyse the information provided and to construct a semantic representation  . 
In this paper a new method of textually modelling meaning paraplwases i proposed for the acquisition of a formal representation of tfie conceptual information conveyed in the meaning paraphrase  . It is described how these paraphrases are subjected to a manual text analysis process in accordance with the KONTEXT model \[  Haenelt/K0nyves-T6th   91  \] . The principle shown are general principles of text analysis and are also applied in the KONTEXT system to textual analysis of corpora  ( provided a basic set of dictionary entries is available  )  . The conceptual mo-delling is based on the model of Semantic Emphasis \[ Kunze  91\]  , which so far has been worked out for verbs . In order to be able to cover the meaning paraphrase as a whole  , and thus to provide a basis for automatic bootstrapping  , this approach has to be exteuded to modelling other word classes  . A proposal fortiffs is made in this paper . 
First of all this paper introduces the approach to textually modelling meaning paraphrases  , then an example is given . The concept and text structure related information i the system dictionary which is used as a basis of acquisition as well as for representing the newly acquired entries is presented in detail  . 
The application of the dictionary to the analysis of a meaning paraphrase is explained  .

PARAPHRASES 2.1 APPROACH
The KONTEXT model \[ Haenelt/KOnyves-T6th   91 \] assumes that natural anguage texts do not communicate complex concepts immediately and at once  , but rather provide sequential instructions concerning how to construct them incrementally  . The instructions are established by the natural language x pres-sions  , which , used in texts , not onty have the function of denoting concepts , but rather can be seen as operators which contribute to the construction of thematic structures and reference objects  . Thematic structure and reference objects then guide the access to e on ~ e epts and the incremental construction of new concept definitions communicated by the text  . The KeN-TEXT model structures the information conveyed in a text and the information describing its contextual organization it of ivelayers of text representation : sentence structure  , thematic structure , view ( on background knowledge ) , and background knowledge . 
In order to construct a conceptual definition in accordance with a meaning paraphrase  , the paraphrase must be analyzed step by step under textual aspects  . 
Each natural language x pression contributes information towards the construction fat least one of the four upper layers of text representation  . The iu-formation of rite expressions of the meaning paraphrase is analyzed and a five-layer eA multistate text representations generated  . ' ltf is generationic ludes operations which incrementally construct  ( new ) con-cept ( s ) and establish the relationship between atural language expressions  , reference objects , and concepts via the thematic structure . 
2.2 EXAMPLE
As an example the fi~llowing meaning paraphrase of " blank " is used : " A blank piece of paper has no writing or other mark  . ~ onit . "\[ COBUILD 87\] . A tex-tuM representation f this paraphrase is shown in fi-gure  1  . The figure illustrates how the conceptual definition of " blank " is constructed step by step  . It shows a text representation with Iigurlayers and five states  . 
The ' sentence structure ' contains the lexemes , their dependency structure ( and further syntactic features not shown here )  . The information of the ' sentence structure ' basically lollows the PLAIN-grammar\[Hellwig  80  ,  88\] . The ' thematic structure ' traces the discourse development  . It shows contexts ( cL boxes 15 in figure 1 ; the numbers refer to file discourse states of their creation  )  , and reti~rences to contexts ( represented by the lines between the boxes ) which correspond to discourse state transitions . The ' reference structure " contains the reference objects  , their

The layer of ' view'shows views on the ' background knowledge ' which have been established by state transitions  . The ' background knowledge ' ( which is shown in figures 2 and 3 ) contains conceptual descriptions of prototypical situations in accordance with the model of Semantic Emphasis \[ Kunze  91\]  . These descriptions are explained in more detail in section  2  . 3 . 1 . 
The state strace the incremental construction f the fi-lial view  ( \[5\] ) of the meaning paraphrase and the ( re- ) definition of the relationship between atural language expressions and reference objects  . So , whilst the dellniend nm " blank " had no conceptual definition in the initial state  ( 1 )  , in the final state ( 5 ) a conceptual definition has been constructed by analy-zing the meaning paraphrase under textual aspects  . 
2.3 THEKONTEXTDICTIONARY
The contribution atura language x pressions make towards the layers of the text representation is described as a lexicalized text grammar  . The informaotion of all the five layers is modelled in feature structures which are processed with the CFS-system\[  K6nyves-T6th   91\]  \[  B6ttcher   91\]  . Due to the forma-lism chosen the basic operation is unification  . 
2.3.1 CONCEP'I~d ALINFOR MATION
The conceptual modelling of the KONTEXT dictionary is based on the model of Semantic Emphasis \ [ Kunze  91\]  . The core components of this model are ' basic semantic forms ' which describe prototypical situations commonly referred to by tile verbs of a verb field  . A'basic semantic form ' is a proposition consisting of predicates and  ( propositional or element a-ry ) arguments . So , e . g . the propositional description of a ' write ' -situation is : CAUSE  ( ACT ( x )  , El " ( BEC(EXIST(w , t )) , BEC ( PLACE-ON(q , w )))) . This description can be paraphrased in the tollowing way : An action of ' x ' causes a't ' to become to exist as ' w ' and this'w'to become placed somewhere such that a relation ' ON ' holds true between ' q ' and ' w'  . The scheme of ' write ' is based on the general scheme of a pro-duce-situation  . 
Situation descriptions provide the basic schemes of the layer of background knowledge of dictionary entries  . They are used for the construction f the layer of ' view'during text analysis  . They can immediately be applied to the modelling of verbs  . For modelling further word classes the following extensions are made : Similarly to Conceptual Dependency approaches  ( e . g . \] Schank 75\] ) in file KONTEXT approach ' basic semantic forms ' are the backbone of conceptual modelling  . Verbs and deverbative abstract nouns are modelled as referring to prototypical situations following the descriptions of the model of Semantic Emphasis  . Prepositions are modelled as deno-ting parts of those situations which have actants which in the surface form can be realized with the preposition i question  . No on s are modelled as deno-ting participants of situations  , and adjectives as deno-ting situations focusing on a particular participant  . 
The defining situations of nouns and adjectives are determined in accordance with the meaning paraphrases of \[ COBUILD  87\] following the textual conditions of applying the situations concerned  . COBUILD definitions are also used in order to describe field external distinctions of verbs  . 
The formal components of the conceptual representation are the feature structure representation of ' basic semantic forms '  , instantiation rules and role derivation rules following tile approach of \[ Kunze  911  . 
The propositional description of the ' write ' -situation is modelled in feature structures in tile following way :\[ CAUSE@<>prep:\[al:\ [ A  ( Tr@<>prop:al:ref : ' x'\] a2:\[ET @<> prop:\[al:\[BEC@<>prop:al:\[EXIST@<> prop:\[al:ref:'w'  a2:ref :' t'\]\]\] a2: \[BEC@<>prop:al:\[PLACE-ON@<>prop:\[al : ref:'q'  a2:ref:'w  '  \]\]1\]\]\]1 Figure 2: Propositional description of a ' write '- situation Predicate names are written in capitaletters  . @<> indicates reference to a type , where <> enclose path descriptions . The arguments of predicates are values of the feature ' prop '  . Elementary arguments correspond to possible reference objects  . 
Depending on the predicates used , instantiation rules are applied in order to get a more refined description of the situation  . E . g . a proposition BEC ( A ) instantiates a monotonic path such that initially NOT  ( A ) holds true , madfinally ( A ) holds true . 
NOT ( A ) is also called the ' presupposition ' f the situation  , and ( A ) is ( one of ) its ' assertion ( s ) '\[ Jung/Kilstner 90\] . The predicate ET has two propositional arguments and requires its argument so be instantiated at the same time  . Thus , either the presupposition or the assertion of both arguments is selected  . 
For elementary ary nments case relations are derived in accordance with a purely formal definition scheme  ( Kunze's approach ( 91 ) provides a theoretical description and formalization of Fillmore's  ( 68 ) deep cases )  . The resulting case relations of e . g . the ACT~DECOLING-92 , NA rerES , 2328 AOt ) r1992 I2ll Pane . OFCOLING-92, NANTEs , AUG .  2328 . 1992' write'-situation are : ' agens of ACT ' , ' to-object of EXIST ' , ' goal of PLACE-ON ' , ' goal of EXIST ' , and ' to-object of PLACE-ON ' . 
A perspective on the situation is determined by emphasis and the selection of actual case relations from the derived potential roles  . By means of emphasis \[ Kunze 911 certain partial propositions are moved into the for e ground  . 
2.3.2 TEXTSTRUCTUREINFORMATION
Based on the model of Semantic Emphasis information concerning the reference structure and the thematic structure can be derived systematically from conceptual information  . 
Potential reference objects are provided for all possible participants of the situation  . The roles they play in the situation are expressed as case relations  . 
Thematic information includes information such as which participants can be realized emphatically  ( not emphatically ) in which surface form . So , e . g . file primary effect of the action of writing ( in the prototypical case ) is that a writing exists , while it is less important where it appears . Therefore at least one of the arguments of the EXIST-predicate has to be realized emphatically  ( i . e . not by a prepositional phrase ) and those of the PLACE-ON-predicate are either e alized without emphasis  ( by a prepositional phrase ) or they are not realized at all . This information then provides the basis for mechanisms of referring to contexts  . E . g . 
only those reference objects which have been realized emphatically can later be referred to by an anaphorical pronoun  . 
2.4 APPLICATION OF THEKONTEXT DIC-
TIONARY TO MODE LLING THEMEA-
NING PARAPHRASE
The words of the meaning paraphrase ( " A blank piece of paper has no writing on it " ) contribute to the constitution of the text representation in the following way : " Has " does not make a contribution to the conceptual definition  . It only " provides a verb for the structure "\[ COBUILD  87:6671 and indicates the ab-stractum " writing " . 
" Blank piece of paper " introduces a participant of a situation  . Its surface form and its syntactic function contribute to determining which participant of which situation it can be  . The defining situation of " paper " ( cf . meaning paraphrase of " paper " ) must be compatible with the newly composed situation it becomes a participant of  ( e . g . the situation of this meaning paraphrase ) . Otherwise a further text is requirod in order to solve this conflict  . 
" Writing " as a noun denotes a participant of as i -marion  , and as a deverbative abstractum at the same time introduces the situation of which it is a participant  . This is the ' write '- situation described in section  2  . 3 . 1 . 
" No " does not make a conceptual contribution of its own  . It , however , has the effect that tile presupposition of the ' write '- situation must be selected  . 
" On " as a preposition denotes parts of those situations which have a clants which in the surface form can be realized with this preposition  . In this case it is a complement of " writing " and serves to introduce the actant of " writing " which is determined by the first argument of PLACE-ON  . As a preposition it introduces a non-emphatic realization of the actant  . 
" It " as a complement of " on " is identified as the ' goal of PLACE-ON ' of the ' write ' -situation  . As a pronoun it refers to an antecedent which had been realized emphatically  . In this case this is the subject of the sentence . Thus , a reference identity of anaphora and antecedent is constructed  , and then both expressions refer to the reference object which denotes the ' goal of PLACE-ON'of the ' write '- situation  . 
In terms of feature structures the result can be expressed in the following way : \[ sent : praed :\[ hassubje:\[paper re\['  . "=< refer 1> \] trans:\[writingref : < refer 2> quant:nocaspp:\[on caspn:\[anaphor'ref := < refer t >  \]1\]\] refer :\[ 1:  \[  5:view:=<view   1>   10: \[ view := < view 5> role := < view 5roles goal place-on>\]\] 2:   8: \[ view := < view 5> role := < view 5voles goal exist > 1\] view:\[t:l\] 5: \[ inst:\[sit-l:Iname:negational :\[ name : exist-asal : ref := < view  5roles goal exist ref > a2: ref := < view 5roles to-obj exist ref >\]\] sit-2: \[ name : negation at : \] name : placed-onal : ref := < view  5roles goal place-on ref > a2: ref := < view 5role"s to-obj place-on ref>111 role . s:\[goal:\[exist:\[ref := < refer 2> emph:plus\]AC'~rESDE COLING-92  , NAI CrES , 2328 AO~I 199212l2Pate .

It has been derived by applying instantiation rules to the propositional part of the conceptual description and by selecting the presupposition  . Relationships to other layers of text representation are denoted as patt i specifications  ( <> )  . 
3 EXPLANATION OF THERESULTING
CONCEPTUAL DEFINITION
The value of the feature ' inst ' can be regarded as the conceptual definition of " blank "  . The meaning paraphrase , however , does not really explain " blank " . It rather explains what it means lor something to be blank  . So , the conceptual definition acquired can be regarded as a rule for composing the ad-jective's meaning and a noun's meaning  , if one takes meaning paraphrases a rule descriptions  . The rule covers conventionalized readings of " blank "  ( this supports an observation described in \[ Boguraev/Pus-tejovsky  90\]  )  . Used in texts , however , these readings undergo further changes ( cf . \[Haenelt92\]) . So , e . g . a word can stepwise be related to a complex concept in a text and then be used as a term  . 
4 CONCLUSION
In this paper a method has been described for transforming the conceptual information of a traditio-nal meaning dictionary by means of textual modelling into a suitable representation for automatic semantic text processing  . The concept definitions acquired can be used for content and text structure ba~d retrieval  ( i . e . access to concepts or relevant text passages ) or for the update of the dictionary ( cf . \[ Firzlaff/Haenelt92\]) . The method proposed is also used for automatic text analysis  , and although it requires a basic set of dictionary entries to be transformed by manual analysis  , its goal is to allow for an automatic continuation of this transformation  . So , if the basic vocabulary of meaning paraphrases has been acquired it should be possible to analyze the majority of meaning paraphrases automatically  . The conceptual definitions acquired from meaning paraphrases then can serve as a basis for analyzing further descriptive text such as e  . g . encyclopedias . In this sense the method described in this paper is meant to be a contribution to w at v ls the automatic bootstrapping of knowledge base construction  .
