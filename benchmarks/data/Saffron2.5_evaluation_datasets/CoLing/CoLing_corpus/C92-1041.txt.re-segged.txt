Tile primary purpose of this paper is to present a set of conditions that constrain accent placement in focused nominally ptemodified NPs  . Selkirk ( 1984 ) argues that if the premodifier is an argument of the head  , then the head can be deaccented . 
I agree with Selkirk's proposal and argue that what is essential is not whether the premodifier is a grammatic a lrgument of the head noun  , but rather , whether it is a 0-complement in lexical conceptual structure . This proposal is evaluated by testing it against a corpus of naturally occurring data  . 
O . introduction
It is generally agreed that an utterance can be divided into two parts which are related to the discourse function of the information represented by that utterance  . The TOPIC is what the sentence is about and the FOCUS represents a new predication about the topic  . This information structure constrains accent placement  . For example , ' primary ' accent must be within the constituent that represents the focused information  . The ability of an accent on a single word to mark a larger phrase as focus is widely recognized  . For example in ( 1 ) the accent on conservative can mark the phrase redneck conservative as the focused constituent  ( since ( 1 ) can be used to answer the question What was your to wn like ?  )  .   ( Accent is indicated by small caps and focus by underlining  . )  11 would especially ike to thank Jeanette Gundel and Nancy Hedberg for discussions and comments  .

(Lia Matera 1988 Smart Money ) in ( 1 ) focus is represented by a single constituent , but this need not be the case as (2) illustrates . 
(2) A : Where ' sKarl ?
B : ~ her ~ .
In (2B ) , Karl , the referent of her , is the topic and tire focus is thus discontinuous . 
Though there seems to be agreement about the importance of a theory that accounts for the ac -cent-focus relation  , there is little agreement about the exact nature of this relationship  . For instance , different theories give different answers to the question of whether this relationship is syntactic  , semantic , morphological , or pragmatic . There is also disagreement over how large a phrase can be brought into focus by a single accent  . 
Even for simple constructions the relationship between accent and focus is unclear  . In exam ~ pies (3)-(7) , a MODIFIER+NOUN constituent is focused . Note that in the ( a ) member of each pair , it is the modifer that receives the accent and in the  ( b ) member of the pair , it is the head noun .

( Bolinger 1986 . 118 ) ~' his paper examines the association of accent and focus in nominally premodified NPs  .  2 1 . 0 previous work . 
Pierrehumbert and Hirschberg ( 1990 ) state that some cases of the relationship between accent and focus seem dear  . For example , when accent is on dress in the glrl with the red DRESS the focus can be information represented by the noun dress  , the NP the red dress , the PP with the red dross , or the entire NP the glrl with the red dress . Whereas , accenting RED in the same phrase can serve only to focus information represented by the adjective red  . 
However , regarding the relationship between accent and focus in general  , they state that q'he question of how an accent becomes associated with certain material is not yet well understood  . '( p309n . 4 ) Some researchers view this rdationship between focus and accent as essentially syntactic  . In the computational literature , Lyons and Hirst ( 1990 ) present the following rule constraining the accent focus relation :  ( 8 ) a . What is accented is necessarily in focus . 
b . ' focus is optionally and nonderermin-istically percolated up the syntax tree  , to any node from its rightmost daughter ( rightmost because stress manifests itself only at the end of the focused constituent  )  . ' (1990 . 57 ) Many theoretical linguists have proposed similar syntactic constraints relating phrasal accent placement and focus  ( see , for example , Chomsky and Halle 1968 , Chomsky 1971 , Jackendoff 1972 , and Culicover and Rochemont 1983) . However , as noted by these researchers , a rule like the one in ( 8b ) makes incorrect predications for most nomi-nally premodified tips  . For example , consider 21 use the more neutral term nominally premodified NP simtead of mmp ~ n ~  .

N " N history teacher
Clearly the NPah/nor ? teacher is the focused constituent  . 3 But by rule ( 8 ) the accent on h/nor ? cannot serve to focus the entire NP since hirt or ? is not the right must daughter of this phrase  . 4 Thus , a phrasal rule such as ( 8b ) cannot be operative in these cas ~ . Instead , history teacher is viewed as a compound ( as a structure of category N0 ) and accent is determined by a separate compound accent rule  , which places stress on the left must element ( see Chomsky and Halle 1968 , and
Selkirk 1984).
Steedman ( 1991 ) claims that accent serves to divide an utterance into an optional constituent that represents the topic  ( what he , following Jackendoff 1972 , calls the ' open-proposition ' ) and a constituent that represent she focus . He argues that within each of these constituents , accent is put on the parr that represents what is ' emphasized or contrasted ' with something in the discourse con-text--the ' interesting part '  . This idea has also been proposed by a number of other researchers  ( see , for example , Schmerling 1976 , Gundel 1978 , Selkirk 1984 , Bolinger 1986 ,  1989 , and Rochemont 1986) . Although there is wide disagreement about the formal definitions of ' topic-focus ' and ' the interesting part'there is no doubt that these are essential pragmatic determinants that constrain accent placement  , and it is equally 5By focused constituent I mean the phr ~ , e that represents focused information . 
4 Rule ( 7 ) also fails in a range of other cases including most intransitive a en~nces  ( Whauh ~ ppened I--BUSH resigned )  .

Consider 11) , a dialogue between two linguistics professors about the dissertation of a student in the department :  ( 11 ) A : What's the dissertation about ?
B : Something to do with language

( = L add 198 0.90 ex .48)
L add ( 1980 ) notes that when linguistics professors are talking about a dissertation of a student in the department  , hey assume that the dissertation is about some aspect of language and language can be de accented  . L add continues ' But the linguist's proud parents  , who are not linguists , would tell their friends , who are also not linguists , that their son's dissertation was about LANGUAGE acquisition  . ' ( Ladd 1980 . 90 ) It could be argued that the accent patterns in ( 3 ) - ( 5 ) are also determined by ' interestingness ' . 
However , the role of ' interesting ness'iless clear in phrases like those in  ( 6 ) and ( 7 )  . As Bolinger (1989 . 200) notes , accent placement in some prenominally modified NPs is more invariable than in others  . For example , while in ( 12 ) the old information constrains the the location of accent  , this is not the case in (13) and (14) (12) a .

2. argument . trucmre and accent
What then governs the location of accent in nomi -nally premodified NPs ? Why  , for example , does He was my history TEACHER sound od das an answer to the question How do you know Franz ? What was he to you ? Selkir k  ( 1984 ) suggests a particularly compelling answer . She presents the two constraints in (15) and (16) . 
(15) Basic Focm Rule
A constituent to which a pitch accent is assigned is a focus  .  (1984 . 207 )   ( 16 ) Phrasal Focus Rule A constituent may be in focus if  ( i ) or ( ii )   ( or both ) is true : i . The constituent that is its head is a fOg ~ us . 
ii . A constituent contained within it that is an argument of the head is a fOCUS  ( 1984 . 207) The Basic Focus Rule in (15) is mandatory . This rule states that every word that contains an accent is necessarily focused  . The phrasal focus rule given in (16) is optional . The rule ( 16 i ) states that if a head is a focused constituent , then any projection of that head can optionally be focused  . If l say (17) Victoria visits BONE yards the N , boneyards , is necessarily a focused constituent by rule (15) . Rule ( 16 i ) permits focus to percolate to the projections N ' and N " as shown in  ( 18 ) :  ( 18 ) Victoria visits\[N " :+ focu , \[ N':+focu , \[N :+ f ~\[ Born'yards\]\]\]Rule ( 16 ii ) states that if an argument of a head is focused , and if that focused constituent is contained within the maximal projection of that head  , then the projection of that head can be focused . For example , if I say (19) Anndanced the tar an TEL lathe N , tarantella , is necessarily a focused constituent . Since this N is the head of the N " , the tarantella , by rule ( 16 i ) the tarantella can be a focused contituent . This N " is an argument of the V , dance a ~ and is contained within the maximal AcrESOF  . COLING-92, NANTES , 2 . 3-28A O~'r 1992 255 PROC . OFCOLING-92, NANTES , AuG . 2328,1992 projection of that V . Thus , the VI'can be a focused constituent by rule ( 16 ii )  . This leads to correct results since this utterance can be used to respond to the question What did Anndo at the party ?  ( She\[V ":+ focus danced the tar an TEL la . \] ) Selkirk's theory of prosody-focus relation predicts the following accent patterns in focused modifier-noun constructions :  ( 20 ) Selkirk's predictions concerning raoeh'fier-noun pairs 
ARGUMENT head adjt mctHEAD
ARGUMENTHEAD ADJUNCTHEAD * argument HEAD * ADJUNC The ad Thus  , if a noun phrase represents focused information , and if that noun phrase consists of an argument followed by the head noun  , then the prediction is that the argument is necessarily accented  . This seems like an elegant way to characterize the difference between leftward and rightward accented prenomina Uy modified noun phrases  , which has been problematic for other approaches to accent placement  . Consider , for example , the difference in accent pattern between ( 21 ) which has an accent on its left constituent , and ( 22 ) which has the accent on its right constituent . 
(21 ) HISTORY teacher ( 22 ) student TEACHERS el kirk's theory offers a straightforward explanation of this difference  . History is an argument of teacher in ( 18 ) and thus by rule ( 13 ii ) representation f the entire noun phrase can be focused  . However , in ( 19 ) student is an adjunct and accenting the head , teacher , is required to focus the representation f that noun phrase  . A similar notion has been suggested by Rochemont ( 1986 ) as shown in ( 23 )  .   ( See Rochemont 1986 for a discussion comparing his focus rules to those of 
Selkirk 1984 . ) (23) a . If 0~is\[+focus\]and(x is X0 , then X n is \[+ focus\] . 
b . If o ~ is\[+focus\]andO ~ is an argument of X  0contained in Xn , then X ? is\[+focus\] . 
c . If X 0 is\[+focus\]and Ct is an adjunct of X ? then O ~ is\[+focus\]  . 
There are three possible relations between a prenominal NP and its head  . The prenominal can be a grammatic alrgument , a complement in lexical conceptual structure , or an adjunct modifier . 
A distinguishing characteristic of an adjunct modifier is that it is licensed by predication  . 5As a result , it can be separated from its head by a copula . For example , in the phrase the red car , red is an adjunct modifier and can be separated from its head as  ( 24 ) illustrates . 
(24) The carisred.
In ( 22 ) student is a modifier and can be separated from its head as in  ( 25 ) The teacher is a student . 
However , in ( 21 ) history is not a modifier and it cannot be separated from its head as  ( 24 ) shows . 
(26) ? ? The teacher is of history.
There is one question that immediately comes to mind : isSdkirk's notion of ' argument'a syntactic notion  ( that is , is it a grammatic a lrgument licensed by A -structure  )  , or is it a semantic notion involving 0-participants in lcs ? 2  . arguments Grimshaw ( 1990 ) argues convincingly that only nouns that have an internal aspeetual nalysis  ( nouns that refer to what she calls complex events  ) have argument sructure ( A-structure )  . She describes significant differences in the behavior of complex event nouns and other nouns to supporth is analysis  . For example , complex event nominals have obligatory arguments a shown in  ( 27 )   ( 27 ) a The assignment is to be avoided . 
b . * The constant assignment is to be avoided.
c . The constant assignment of unsolvable problems is to be avoided  . 
( Grimshaw199 0.50 ex.8)
Grimshaw considers assignment to be ambiguous between a complex event interpretation and a process interpretation  . The addition of the modifier constant forces the complex event interpretation since constant can only be construed as a modifier of assignment on the complex event reading  . Thus , it's A-structure must be satisfied as in ( 27 c ) just as 5That is , the meaning of modifier is predicated on the external rgument of the head noun  ( Its Rargumen 0 .

c . * We constantly assign.
( Grimshaw199 0.50 ex.8)
If Grimshaw's analysis is correct , as I believe it is , then the argument referenced in Selkirk's Phrasal Focus Rule  , is best not construed as an argument in A -structure  . For while rule ( 16 ) would make correct predictions regarding complex event nominal such as those illustrated in  ( 29 )  , it fails on nominals that do not represent complex events as in  ( 30 )   ( 29 ) a . TREE felling b . COOKIE baking (30) a . HISTORY teacher b . BIT guzzler 1 believe the distinction is a semantic one involving  0-participants in lexical conceptual structure ( Ics )  . Every verb and noun ( including deverbal nouns ) has a lexical conceptual structure that includes the entities involved in the events or states described  ( see , for example , Dowty (1989) , Fillmore (1968) , and Jackendoff (1987 ,  1990)) . 
Selkirk's intuitions expressed in rules ( 15 ) and ( 16 ) are essentially correct . Reformulating her rules as constraints between lexical conceptual structure and focused information offers a more precise characterization fher insights  . A reformulation of ( 15 ) and ( 16 ) constraining the accent-fo-cus relation of premodified NPs containing a deverbal element is given in  ( 31 ) and ( 32 ) :  ( 31 ) The representation facon stituent is focused if that constituent receives a pitch accent  .

Consider the pairs in (33) and (34).
(33) a . PACKAGE delivery b . overnight DELIVERY (34) a . CETACEAN research h . university RESEARCH According to Grimshaw , neither delivery nor research as an A-structure since neither has an internal aspectual analysis  . However , since these are both deverbal nouns , they inherit their O-structure from the related verbs  . Package , then , is a 0-comple-ment of delivery , since package is the theme of deliver , ( He delivers packages ) . Thus delivery can be deaccented as in (33a ) . I to we ver , itt (33b ) , overnight is not a O-complement of delivery ( * tie delivers overnight ) and thus delivery must be accented . Likewise , in ( 34 a ) cetace an is the theme of research ( He researches cetaceans ) and thus research can be deaccented . However , in ( 34 b ) university is not a 0-complement of research and research must be accented .

However , 1 suggest that woman in ( 41 a ) is not a complement of swimmer . Woman SWIMMER is an appositional compound ( similar to helicopter GUNSHIP )  . Appositional compounds are lists of propositions , and like all lists , the last element of the list typically receives the main accent  . Some evidence to support his view that ( 41 a ) is appositional is that the prenominal can be separated from the head by a copula as in  ( 42 )   ( 42 ) The swimmer is a woman . 
Following Booij and van Haffxen ( 1988 ) Ibdieve that a semantic effect of-er af Fz xation is to bind the agent or experience r in lcs  . Thus , the agent role is not available to the representation fwoman and that representation must be linked by  0-iden-tification   . Other examples of this type include ( 36 ) and ( 37 a & b )  . In cases were the nonhead is the agent of the head the accent pattern varies -- some-times the head receives the accent  ( as ( 390 , (41b ) , and ( 41c ) ) and at other times the nonhead receives the accent as in  ( 43 )  . 6 (43) a .

There is some controversy as to whether such constructions are possible  . For example , Selkirk (1982 . 34 ) restricts subjects from occurring in these compounds by use of the rule presented in  ( 40 )   ( 40 ) The SUBJ argument of a lexical head may not be satisfied in compound structure  . .
Sproat and Liberman ( 1987 ) point out that subjects in compounds are not usually accented  . The examples they give are presented in ( 41 )   ( 41 ) a . woman SWIMMER b . child DANCING c . student DEMONSTRATION

Deverbal nouns head 25% of the nominally pre-modified Nps in the corpus examined  .   7 Since deverbal nouns are distinguished from other nouns in the lexicon  , the generation system can correctly determine when to apply the rule in  ( 32 )  . As Dowry (1989) , Jackendoff (1987 , 1990) and others have noted , lexical conceptual structure is needed for correct semantic interpretation  . ( For computational pproaches see Charniak (1981) , Dorr (1989) , and Sowa (1991) . ) Thus , the rule requires only information that has independent motivation for being in the lexicon  . 
As Selkir knoted , the same factors that governaccent placement in these constructions also constrain accent in verb phrases and sentences  . In both cases the semantic interpretation of a head can be focused if its  0-complement is focused . 
6This variation in accent is ~ seen in agents realized u verb  . The ydn nntne?eum'ily have A-structure ( other than the external role for nouns )  . 
ACRESDE COLING-92 , NANTES , 2328 AO~r1992258 PROC . OFCOLING-92, NANTES , AUG .  2328 , 1992 The same rules ( (31 ) and ( 32 ) ) are operative . Thus accenting potatoes in John twaddles POTATOES can serve to focus the representation  ( x t waddle spotatoes ) and similarly , accenting potato in POTATO twaddler focuses the representation  ( the x such that ( x t waddle spotatoes ) ) . 
A central question in the study of intonation is what factors governaccent placement  . I have argued here that argument structure plays no role in this determination at least as to prenominally modified noun phrases and have shown how a theory of focus like the one presented in Selkirk  1984 can be refined to account for semantic on -straints for accent placement  .
