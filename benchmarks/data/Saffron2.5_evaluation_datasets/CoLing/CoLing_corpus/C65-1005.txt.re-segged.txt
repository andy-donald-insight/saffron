I . Machine Translation.
To translate a special text from one language into another means to construct to the given text in the first language  , such a text in the second-one that has the same ~   ( the same is told in it ) like the given text . 
The t_ranslation from a ~ tu ~ allanguage LI into a language is such a function F  ( in the more general case it is a many-valued function  ) which assigns to any text T in the language LI such a text F  ( T ) in the language L2 , that F ( T ) has the same meaning like To If we introduce a semantics  ( or interpretation ) M as a function ( in general also man ~- valued ) which to any ex~res-sio____~nE of some language L assigns its meaning M\[E ~  ( compare\[~\] )   , it is possible to say that the function F assigning the texts F  ( T ) from L 2 to the texts T from L 1 is the translation only when ( 1 ) M\[TJ = M\[F ( T ) J for any text T from LI . 
At the machine ( or automatic ) translation , the matter is , to define the function F as a mechanizable procedure  ( io e . 
algorithm ) according to which an arbitrary starting text T in L is being succedingly modified till we get the translated text F  ( T ) fulfilling naturally ( I ) o The corresponding algorithm can be finally programmed for a suitable computer  . With respect to the used computer , the programme of the algorithm must not be too long  , not even the wide range of memories must not be emploied and at last the translation must not take up too much of time  . 
Usually it is required for the algorithm of a translation  , to be the most effective . 
~ ul~k 2   2oTranslation_"Sentence busentence "= The translation F is theoretically -as every function-defined texts in L  1  . If we really had these pairs practically at disposal  , we could use a trivial algorithm of the translation F ~ should put in the memory of the computer all the pairs ~ T  , F ( T ) \] we and when being Riven the starting text T , we should find out in the memory the pair , in the first place of which T would be situated , thus the pair IT , F ( T ) . \]  , and the demanded translation F ( T ) would be on the second place of this pair ? Thic is  , of course , not only funny but also impossible . 
It seems to be funny because of the fact that to have practically at disposal the pairs IT  , F ( T )   7 it would mean to use live-ly translation and thus to translate all possible texts in advance  . 
But the automation of translation signifies to exclude as much as possible the direct intervention of manout of the proceeding of the translation and thus to sustitute a man by a machine  . On that score , we do not possess practically the pairs ~ T , F ( T )\] . 
It seems to be impossible because the texts T are too manu  ( it would be possible to admit that infinitely many  ) and the pairs IT , F ( T ) J could not be included in any computer ? On the other hand  , it is necessary to admit that it concerus the algorithm  , which is very simple ( only to look up in the memory would take up too much of time  )  . 
The trivial algorithm being practically impossible  , it is necessary to try to decompose long texts into parts and then to translat apart by part  . Naturally , it seems to be profitable , to treat sentences , that are in printed texts distinctly separa-ted by points  , as these Darts . Thus , every text T is a sequence ~ ulik 3 of partial texts , i . eo sentences Sl , $2, . . . ~Sk so that we ~ Tite that T = / SI , S2, o . . , Sk ) J ? The function of the may translation F is , of course , according to the a sumption defined for all texts and thereby also for particular sentences SI  , S2t . . . ,S k so that it is possible to construct a somposed text LF  ( SI )   , F ( S2) ,  . . . ~F ( Sk ) /from the translations of these sentences F ( SI )   , F (~) ,   . . . , F(Sk ) , that ere some partial texts in L2? At the same time , the translations of sentences follow in the same sequence as did the starting s~nten-ces in the text To It may happen-and we should sure welcome it  , if it were always - that it holds (2) F ( slos2 o . .s k ) - IF ( s l ) ? F ( s 2 ) o . .F(s k ) . I or at least the weaker condition ( 3 ) ? From ( 2 ) the r ~ follows ( 3 ) but in no way the contrary ? For the translation the condition  ( 3 ) is sufficient . It might , namely , happen that we translate the text T , as a whole , differently than when translating it succeedingly in parts  S1  , S2 ,  . . . ,Sk , so that (2) does not hold , but despite this (3) holds . 
In the condition ( 2 ) and similarly the condition ( 3 ) were fulfilled for any text T = ( SloS2o . .S k ) in L1 , it would signify that it was always possible to translate single sentences of the text quite independently each of another  . It is probably not true . 
Sometimes , it is necessary to know , how the sentence S1 was translated , when we want to translate correctly the sentence  ~  , becau-~ullk 4 seregularly both sentences are connected as to the contents  , and not always this connection is expressed by syntactical means  . In addition , sometimes it is necessary to translate too long sentences from LI as two or more sentences from and then not even the sequence is possible to be defined in advance  . 
In spite of this , the condition ( 2 ) or at least ( 3 ) is the basic a sumption for Any translation " sentence b ~ sentence " and most part of translation belongs to such a type of contemporary translations  . To be competent to accept the a sumption ( 2 ) or ( 3 ) it sufficies to confine oneself to some texts only  , and the texts not fulfilling this assumption are necessary to be adapted before the translation in order to make them able to fulfill it  . 
It is not clear , of course , how to find it out at the given text , before starting the translation . 
? heasumption ( 3 ) stands for nothing else than ( 4 ) and hence the substantial simplifying of the definition of translation can to be seen  . It suffices , namely , to suppose that it is necessary to define only a partial function F ~ of the function F  , that is defined for arbitrary sentences in LI only  ( on no account for arbitrary texts when the sentences are a special case of simple texts  )  . Thus , there holds F ~ ( S ) = F ( S ) for every sentence from LI and out of ( 2 ) there follows ( 5 ) sl . s2 . . . sk):IF'(sI ~ . ~( s2) . .  . F  ~ ( s ~ ~ jvF ( ~ ulfk 5 so that in fact we are able to cope with the function F ~ when translating the texts  . 
Similarly , like at the function F , it is possible at the function ~ too , to try to give a trivial algorithm making full use of all pairs \[ S  , F~ ( S ) ~ oBut the situation improves only a little . It wold be again necessary to translate all the sentences in advance and even these are still too many  , so that all preceding reasons remain valid , what means , that it is necessar ~ to try to decompose even the sentences in parts  , and to translate the sentences in parts , too ? 3o Translation " word by word "_? By the decomposition of the translation into sentences there were no difficulties because in printed texs this decomposition into sentences was just ready  , and according to the syntanctical means it was possible to decompose its parts @ Of the same simplicity and uniqueness is the decomposition of the sentence S in its single words WI  , W2 , ooo , Wk separated by interspaces , so that it is possible to write S = ( WIW2 . .oW k ) like at the text . 
Besides , the linguists have constructed , along time ago , a binary translative dictionary from the language L  1 into the language L~o This dictionary is , in fact , defined as a set of the pair of words , the first-one from L 1 and the second-one from L 2 having the same meaning o if we denote by f the translation from L  1 into ~ , where f is again generally many-valued ~ ulf k 6 function ( thanks to the homonymy of words ) f the condition ( in details se- . L3 . i ~) evidently fulfils
W from L 1.
In whatever wmy the trivial algorithm of the translation of texts and sentences was funny and impossible  , this algorithm is in case of the translation of words not only possible  , but also it is used from time to time by living translators  . At most machine translations , there is really choosen for the algorithm of the translation f the just mentioned trivial algorithm  , i . e . 
into the memory of a computer there are input all pairs W  , f ( W ) and the most tedious procedure is-how it was said-to lookup in the memory and to compare  . 
But it is not necessary to use this trivial algorithm ? It is possible to construct a sequential automaton and thus to construct also a corresponding technical apparatus which will realize the function f  , io e o if there enterson its input the word W as a sequence of letters  ll12  . oolk , which is eventually prolongated by the means of several help-symbols  ( compare\[5\] ) we get on output again the sequence of letters Ii12  . . . ikD that eventually starts with several help -symbols and simultaneously there holds that iW ~ when W =  1112   . ljj < k (7) f(ll12 o . .l j ) = i i i . . . Ik , . .  , _ ? There is a question , whether there is not possible , when using this automaton , to shorten the time necessary for translating ~ when evidently all lost times can be excluded at looking up in the input dictionary o~ulf k  7 Taking no account to the fact , in what way the translation of words f is given , one may ask , whether for the sentence
S = ( WIW2 . . . Wk ) there holds ( s ) z ( s ) =\ [ fewl ) f ( w2 ) f ( W2 ) ooof ( Wk > , which is the similar condition to the condition ( 2 ) for the translation of texts . 
It is known that this condition holds nearly never for most natural languages  , because the translation of words f is the translation of words in basic form only  , whereas by the decomposition of the sentence WI , W2 , o . oWk are in various word-form so To put it 8ifferently:the function fres-pects only the lexical meaning of words but does not take into consideration morphological questions ? However even in the case ~ the  f1~nction f could be pro-longated from basic forms on other form of words - what  , of course , need not be possible-or on the contrary , if we adapted to the basic form single words W i in the decomposition of the sent cnce ~ yet despite this all-even under these suppositions -the condition  48  ) would be fulfilled in the case only , that there are concerned two languages L 1 and L 2 that are very strongly cognate , or two dialects of the same lamguage jor in the case L  1 and L 2 are not cognate , the considered sentence S must be very simple o The translation fulfilling the condition analogous to the condition  ( 8 ) may be called the translation " word b3 ; word "? But unfortunately it is known that such a translation is im-~ulfk  8 possible in natural languages , although it would be very advantageous and simple ? It does not mean  , of course , that the decomposition of the sentence into words cannot be used  ; it is too fine and therefore it is necessary to decompose the sentence in another w ~ y  , at all events in such a way that single parts will contain more than one word  ( and we suppose , undertacit consent , that the words have full meaning , not only being help-wor~s with the ~ rammer meaning  ) and that these parts need not be sentences ? Before introducing these parts ~ it is necessary to take into consideration various necessary morphological and grammatical statements  , and thereby to adapt properly the condition (8) , too , wher ~ there were no differences between the basic word form or the mere stem of the word and its various possible forms ? ~ ullk  9   4  . Syntactical and semantical characteristics of words  . 
First of all we may suppose that , to a very word form ( shape ) which appeared in the decomposition of some sentence into words  , we are able to define its basic fo ~ nor stem W ( the function f ' refers just to these basic forms  ) and its charaqteristic'c = ( xI , x2 ,   . . .   , xn ) , where n is according to the need a sufficiently great integer and singlex j are some gran ~matical morphological and eventually even other data referring to the form W  . For example xI can be the datumon word-kind , x2 the datumon case , time , x7 x3 on gender , on mood a . s . o . 
x4 on number , x5 on person , x6 on
Naturally we also assume that on the contrary , if it is given the basic form w and prescribed ( of course admissible ) the characteristic c , it is easy to define the starting form ~$ . 

Thus , we suppose that there are given functions h and h -such that h  ( W )  =  ( w , c ) and
T guages ( in LI and ~2h-!(w , c ) : W in each of considered fan-it will be functions hI and  h2  )  . 
Although it is wellknown that the sentence and its translation need not have the same nL nn be r of words  , this demand is not far from truth when we pay attention only to the full-meaning words  . Let us consider , however , such sentences S which fulfil this demand ( this is the supposition for making the conm~ent easy  ) i . e . if it is S = ( WIW2 . . . WK ) then (9) F#(W1W2 .   .   . = "'" WX ), ~ ullk I0
T where evidently ~ i are the words of the decomposition of the--~K sentence F ~  ( S )  . The task is , how to get the chain ( W1W2 . . . ) from the given chain ( W1W2 . . . WE ) and we know already that it is not possible to get it by means of the translation word by word according to  ( 8 ) directly . 
When we use a function its basic form : ( wi , ci ) and data wi and characteristic ci , namely , and thus we can differentiate the data ( cI , c2 ,   . . . , cK ) . 
hI we get from any wordform Wih.(W .):
J-l(WI , W2,'.-, WK)
It is similar with the translated sentence when one uses the function  h2   ( ~ i )  =  ( ~i ' ~ i ) "  ( wIw2 . . . wE ) h2 . Again we are able to discern data ( ~l ' ~2'"'" ~ K ) when evidently Now , it is clear that instead of the condition ( 8 ) ought to be the condition ( I0 ) ~ i = f ( wi ) for i = 1 , 2 ,  . . . , k because here f is really used for basic for~s of words  . Then the translation fulfilling ( i0 ) is in fact the translation , , word by word " but only in the respect of the meaning of word  , being far from complete translation . There is missing the proceeding , how to get from the starting characteristic ( c ! , c2 ,   . . . , c K ) characteristic ( ~i ' ~2'"'" cK ) " And just here there is impossible-except for the most simple example-to find such a function g ~ n order to hold  ( ! i ) ci = g ( ci ) for i-1 , 2 ,  . . . , k . 
~ ullkII .
tlonit would evidently hold
If it were the case , or in tl~ese cases for which the func-g Could b ~ found  , the translation would be easy , because 0k , g(ci ) for i = 1 , ~ ,  . . . , (13) G(Cl,c2, . . . , c K ) : cx )' as it was to be in ( Ii ) , ( cI , c2 ,  . . . , c K ) where , properly , would be necessary to differentiate functions-c K  ) ~~ k . G1,G2,GI < and put ci = Gi(cl,c2, . , . , o i = 1, 2, . . . 
Whereas the condition ( lO ) has been fulfilled quite frequently #~ especially at I simple sentences and above all when we weaken it by admitting the changed the order ir ~ of words Wi in comparison with words ~ i  )  , i . e . it is often possible to translate word by word as for the meani~s of single ~ ords  , the condition ( ll ) has nearly never been fulfilled . It can be understood , because in the respect of meaning the languages do not differ as a matter of fact and this matters in  ( lO )  , while morphologically and eventually even gran ~ati-cally sidle languages differ verystro ~ ly and these facts matters in  ( ll )  . 
so that dependence on the sole characteristic ci but independence on all characteristics it may be written analogically to  ( 9 ) where , of course , hl(WI ) = ( wi , ci ) for i = 1 , 2 ,  . . . , k . 
As it is impos ~ i bie to translate one characteristic after another  , it is necessary to use instead of the supposed ( but in general not existing ) function g , the more complicated function G . This function will not define single characteristics ~ i in ~ ul/k  12 From this also follows that difficulties of impossibility of the translation wo ~' d by word accordi ~ to  ( 8 ) are - for the differentiation of the meaning = - and characteristic-due to the characteristic and not to theme ahings  . This fact has a conside-rable heuristic import . It is , ne~mel ' , evident that the suitable parts into vJ hich % re want to decompose the sentences are to be found v ~ ith respect to their significance and not with respect to their syntactical or even morphological properties  , in this case , namely , these parts will be found at the same time in all languages even if having been expressed in different lang ~ uages by different syntactical an morphological means  . It is naturally self-evident that between the significance of considered parts and their syntactical expressions are close connections  ( see\[~3 )  . 
Because of this , it is necessar 3: to introduce , besides ~ mentioned characteristics some others more  , namely , logical and semantical that will be co~uuon for all ! ang ~ uages and will be ojaite independent of the syntax of la ~ uages  . And just this condition is fulfilled by the logical and semantical questions  . 
Under the logical characteristics of v , ~ ords we understand data on the fact , ~vhether and vz hat logical conjuctions or other logical means  ( as quantors or negations ) are by these vlords expressed . 
These facts are known from the logical analysis of sentences v Jorked "% fh-v ~?- out by ~  . ~ a ~ p . 
By these r ~ antical characteristics of ~ , ~ ords ' , reunderstand data on the fact ~ vhether the given word  ( v ~ c suppose v ~ , or dv , ,ith full meaning , in no waygra ~ mmatical or logical v , ,ords ) plays the role of individual constant , or variable i . e . v , ' hether it defines a certain otject ~ ull k , ,13  ( here the te~n object is used in the wide sense of the term  ) orce ~ ~ a ~ n propertied , or plays the role of an arbitrary-one with-one -placed predicat  , i . e . denotes some property , or of two-placed predicat , i . e . denotes two-member relation , or in general n-placed predicat , i . e . denotes n-figured relation . 
The situation is not so hopelessly complicated as it would seem at the first sight  . For instance , the individual constants even the variables are only substantives while verbs are always predicats one-  . two-three-even more placed , according to the smaller or greater number of their objects  . Adjectives are always one-placed predicate a . s . o . 
Besides the mentioned - and in the logic current- it is necessary to consider as semantical characteristics data On time and place and probably not yet cuite distinctly defined data referring to the conditions under which the situation is beir ~ g described  ( here belong some adverbial modifier )  . 
Thus , we suppose that We know the function k ( analogously like h ) which to any ~ ; ord-form W assigns its logical and semantical characteristic d  , thus , k(W ) = d , while againd = ( yly2 X1 ,   ,   ,   . . . , y ) where e . g . y is a datum , whether the 2 word W is the logical functor and of what kind ~ y is a datum  3 wh ~ ther the word ~ i is predicate and how many -placed  , y a datum of what kind the predicate is ,   y4 whether there is in ~: l the definition of time and of what kind  , ac . ~ inl ~ zon of place and of whattype , yd,~i .   . nltion of the condition a . s . o . 
y 5 whether W is the 6 a datum on the special ~ ulik 14   5- Primitive phrases . 
With respect to the semantical characteristics of v : ords it ~  . L---~?, . ? is possible and quiten ~ ural similarly as in the prec~c~te-logle-to take as important in a sentence such phrases  ( i . e . their parts ) that include always one word playing the role of n-placed predicate-socalled basi coredicate - in this ~ raso  ( while phrases contain n + lv ~' ords ) and the other words ( just in the number n ) play the role of individual constants or var . a ~ ies bei~g placed on single places ( positions ) of the considered predicate . In accordance with the mention edit referrs ~ in this nhrase  , to the denotation of the n-membered relation and to the de~o~_on of all n objects that are mutual in this relation  . Thus , every such phrase is , in fact , a c ~ r ~ a . .~ statement or a def in i t ion on the situation , as ~? is the analogy of the primitive fo ~ u ! ain them a themazical logic  ( e . g . 
o ~ uz ~ when we Kno~v that P is P ( a ! , a2 , a3 ) is the primitive f -'~? a three-figured predicate  , that Xl , x2 , x 3 are individual constants placed on their three places  , and that the mention e5 records a ~ , s that the objects denoted by these constants are in relation denoted by the predicate P  ) we ca 7~ such a phrase the primitive ~ h ~ , ' S ' ~"7'-~_ ~ aneou ~ ! jo , ' , -" ~ ~ sirz ~ ~ edmatel ~ , " evident"~~'~nneprimitive J . b--phrase need not nave the grcmm~atica ! for ~ of a sentence  , and in most cases it really does not ~ have it it  ~   . . . . '~~ ~ ?  . os ~ morn o ~ a sentence just when its predicate is a verb and v : henth is verb has not the gra~z : atica !- ~ ~  . om of ager odnd or a participle . For instance , , a man reads a book " is the i~:rimitive phrase in the form of a j r~m~atical sentence  ( here evid ~ , n t ! y , , reads " plays the role of two-f igured predi-cat  ~  ) ~ but ~ , "  . . u primit ive phrase , , a man reading book " or , , a man who ~ ullk 15 is reading a book " has not the form of a sentence even if having the same meaning like ' the preceeding phrase  , because both express the same fact . Some other types of primitive phrases are e . g . these , , very good " wh~re , , very " is a one-placed predicate and on the place of it stands  , , good " ( although in another primitive phrase , , good book " is good itself a one-placed predicate  )  , or , , reads quickly " , where a one-placed predicate is quickly a . s . o . 
From these examples there follows that primitive phrases correspond with primitive formulas in the predicate logic of higl ~ er order  . In the phrase , , man is mortal " there is evidently concealed the universal quant or  , , every " so that this phrase has the same mean i ~ like  , , every man is mortal " and thereby to not a primitive phrase but a composed-one  . 
With regard to the syntactical side , the primitive phrases differentiate on the basis of the characteristics of single words  . 
For instance , the sequence of word-characteristics ( el , c2 , c $) where Cl , c2 , c  ~ are such that cI denotes a substantive in the first case  , c2 denotes a transitive verb , cI and c 2 simultaneously coinciding in their components as for the gender and nur ~ ber  , and at last c 3 signifies that it referrs to a substantive in the fourth case  , when , in addition , the rar~e of characteristics sets the future word -order  , is the characteristic of the primitive phrase , , a man reads a book " ( when an indefinite article is a considered not to be self-contained word \] and we assign ital ~ ays to the wol~suce eding iti~m ~ ediately  )  . If we , namely , made full use of the function h we would get h\ [ aman\]:\[man  , ci ~ i \] , h\[reads\]=\[read , cR \] and h\[a book3=\[book , CB\] , and ~ ul/k 16   simultaneousl7 it coulssure hold c ~ r ~ : ~= cl , cR = c2 and cB = c3 . 
The considered language is , besides its word-store put down in the dictionary  , characterized also by the list of all characteristics of primitive phrases  . That is what we shall suppose at any of the considered languages  . 
If we use for the considered primitive phrases . That is what we shall suppose at any of the considered languages  . 
if we use for the considered primitive phrase , , a nan reads a book " the function k , we get some semantical word-characteris-tics d ~ \[  , dy ~ and dB , and one of them will be especially distin-~ul~n ~ a as a basic predicate of the considered type of the orimitive phrase  . In our case it is dR and for illustration wes ~ all come to an agreement that this basic predicate and other sem~ntical characteristics will be put down in the same way like it is done ? in the predicate logic  , namely dR(d ~ , ~ , dB ) . Let us call this entry the semantical ch ~racteristic of the considered phrase and also the semantical characteristic correspondi ~ with the syntactical characteristic  ( c ~ j i , CR , c5) of the considered phrase . .~n~lo~ous agreements are to be made even with respect to other components of th ~ semantical characteristic  , particularly for the definition of time , place and other conditions . 
~; ~ t the same time , the semantical characteristic comprises these facts : dRadat~n that it refe=rs to the two -figured predicate  ( eventually specialized by ~" edenotat ~ . on of some acti-vity ) , on the first place of which is just the word , with the seman-~ica ! characteristic d~i ( e . g . ~vit hashpplement , , agens ") and ~ ul!k 17 he second place of w . ~! ch corresponds with the semantical characte-o ristic dB  ( eventually with supplement , , patiens ") . Simultaneously , the semantical characteristics may be eventually complemented with further data  , when it turns out to be suitable . It is important only , that there are to be data ( as it is mentioned in the parentheses ) that referr to the meanir ~ and that are common for all languages  . 

By the semantival characteristic dR(dN , dB ) there is put down , in the basic semantical categories , just what we want to express ( By that time the basic forms Read , ~ an , Bookarefai ! ir ~ ; ~? these are possible to be chosen differently ) whmle the corresponalng syntactical characteristic  ( c  ~ , cR , c . ) ~ puts down how to expr@ssit . 
Now , the way is evident , how to translate primitive phrases from the language L  1 into L 2  . There is important that ' , ~esuppose that whatever can be expressed in LI , can be expressed even in L 2 what is the basic supposition on the possibility of translating  . 
From this there follows for the function of the translation of l words f that for every basic form W from L there exists f  ( W ) in L2 , and that for ev . ery semantical characteristic dl(d2, d3, . . . , dn ) corresponding with the syntactical characte-r is tic  ( cil'ci2'"'"Cin ) in LI there exists the syntactical characteristic  , correspondil ~ with it ( Cjl , c j 2 ,   . . . , Cjn ) in L2 and just this-one ( of course they may be several ) will be declared to b ~ the trabslation of the corresponding syntactical characteristic from L I  . Thereby a further function ~ is defined ~ eventually a many-valued  ) for which there holds that ~ ul/k18 ( !4 )  ~  ( Cil , ci2 ,   . . . , Cin ) l : ( Cjl , cj2, . . . , c . ) 2 ~ n ~ whe ( . , ) I , ( . . . . .  )~ ?  . ?- have the s~esemantical characteristic . 
:\[ wi , ci \] for i : !, 2, .   . , n , ( cl , c2, . ' . , Cn ) ! characteristic Now , if it is given a or ~ aitive phrase LI we use first t ~ he function h and we get h\[  ( Wi ) \] = and thus its syntactical but now ( W ! , W2 ,  . - . , Wn)I(cI , c2, . - . , Cn )! == ( Cjl , cj2, . . . , Cjn ) 2 so that (15) F~'(WIW 2 .   .   . W n ) = ( h21 ~ f(W . ol ) ' Cjl\]h21\[f(wj2)'cj2\]"'" . cj \]) and this is , in fact the needed weaken i ~ of the condition ~ !~  )  . 
It is evident that the primitive phrase from L 2 on the right hand side of the equation ( 15 ) has really the same meaning as the primit ~ e phrase on the left hand of the equation  . As for ~ nemeaning of single words ~ this is guaranteed by the function ~ and as for the meaning o ? the whole phrase  , it is guaranteed by the function ~ , that luhll-s ( 14 ) that here in a special case plays the role of the function G  , because (!4) and (13) are identical . 
~ulfk 196. Compound phrases.
The composing of two or more primitive phrases in compound phrases can be performed by the usual logical means  ( e . g . 
by means of logical conjunctions " even " or " if , . . . the no . ." eventually of other analogous conjunctions like " but " and similar  , or by mo~ns of negation and quantors ) in av~ll-known way , or c~n be perfomed by the pure linguistic expressive means  . Both these kind ~ may be arbitrarily interchanged by the successive compo-sing  . 
Similtaneously , it is decisive that the composing of single primitive phrases corresponds with the composing of their syntactical and  , of course , semantical chsrac ~ eristics o Besides , there are mostly composed such two phrases that have some word in common  , or where some word is repeated . This fact is necessa-ry to be distinguished especially by composing the corresponding rharacteristics  , or - what is in substance the sam ~- it is necesse-r ~ ~ to jointoar ~ word-characteristic c the symbol express ~  . ngava -" lriable for the basic for . ms of word , so that we shall write X , c1v , ,here we can put for X the real basic forms of words  . 
The composing of primitive phroses in compound phrases belong to the field of the synthesis of phrases ? If we  , for instance ~ want to say that some man reads s book and simultaneously that here ads quickly and ~ in addition  , that this book is good ~ nd even very good , we can express it in the following cnmound phrases P =  ( which is zramm~tically the form of the sentence ) " m ~ n reads quickly a very good book "? The syntax of this phrn~e isn~t evidently ew press~d b $" the logical means ? In the considered case the following primitive phrases are  P1 " Po="reads quickly " , concerned := " amareads a book , P~="good book " and P4 = " very good " oFrom these phrases the compound phrase is put to get h cro If we use the function h fcr single words of the considered phrase  , we get successively h\[aman \] = ~ man , Cl \] , h\[quicklyl = L quick , c2 . 7, hEreadsI = L-read , C3~o . . '  ,   ,   ,   , h\[a book \] = ~ book , , c J~where Cl , C2 , ooo ,   0   6 are the correapon-dine syntactical characteristics ? Analogously when we use the fun -ction k we get the semantical characteristics of single words ? The syntactical characteristics of single  ( separate ) primitive phrases PI' P2'   P3'   P4 are successively CI , C2 , C3 , C4 ,   ,   ,   ,   ,   ,   ,   , L " 3 , e3 , ) C3 = ( D ? 5 , C51 ~ ~ W6 , c6 . I ) and C4 = ~: ;4' c4 . ~'\[ WS'c5 . ~) ? At the same time , there is very important that some variables W i occur simultaneously in two primitive phrases ? Thereby is  , namely , expressed the circumstance that by these two phraes is told so-mething of the same fact and just this circumstance plays the decisive role at stating the constents-connection among more phrases ? If we started from the given phrase " a man  quic1~ly reads a very good book " we would find the mentioned four primitive phrases as follows : first we would use for single words the functi-on handk and then we would find for every word of the mentioned phrase  , which can be the basic predicate of some primitive phrase  ( it can be found out of its semnatical characteristics and by the semantical characteristics of the primitive phraes  ) further words belonging to it in a certain primitive phrase  , io e o which take places of the considered predicate and this occurs only ~ ulf k  21 in comparison of the syntactical characteristics of words frcm the given phrase with the syntactical characteristics of a certain investigated primitive phrase ? For instance  , in our case ~ if we have found out according to the semnatical characteristic that the word " reads " is two-placed predicate  , we would find out the syntactical characteristics cf such primitive phraes  , the basic word of which was just the two-placed predicate  . Then we have kncwn what syntactical characteristics of words and - as far as the word -order is concerned-where there are to be found  , so that we find out whether the investigated primitive phrases are in the given phrase included ? When finishing it for all these words  , we shall find it successively for all primitive phrases that in the given phrase are comprised ? In such a way is  , namely , depicted the analysis of the compound phrase , not composed by the logical means . If there are used the logical means , then the given phrase is decomposed like in the logic ? Rutit is necessary to mention in addition  , that for the economy-reasons and for saving the number of syntactical characteristics of the primitive phrases  , it is convenient to work often with incomplete characteristics only o The question is  , whether we shall include two primitive phrases " aman reads a book " And " the man read a book " into one  ( incomplete ) syntactical characteristic , or into two different and naturally complete- ones  . The incompleteness wi\]l consist in the failing fact on number  ( and si~ni \] arly it woula be in other phraes with data on gender and case  )  , but naturally there would not fail ~ ulik 22 the datumon coincidence in number between , , a man " and , , reads or , , the man " and , , read " because this fact will be ~ . ~st decisive for the incomplete characteristics . 
The possibility of the use of incomplete syntactical characteristics by the synthesis is  , of course , also evident . If we want to make the whole synthesis of the compound phrase independent on proper meanings of single words  , then we can givG in the syntactical characteristics neither the gender nor the number  , because both of them are defined differently no so oner than by the choice of the basic form  ( because in many cases genders are steadily fixed )  . But even here it is not the matter of principle but the matter of effectivity  . 
7. Sementica ! dependence and connectedness.
As , sccording to the supposition , there is denoted in every primit vephrase its basic predicate which always stands in front of parantheses in its semantical characteristic  ( for instan-ceatQ ( x , y ) Q is the basic predicate ) it is possible to define the semantical dependence among the words of the primitive phrase by the demand that the basic predicate a ! v ~ays depends on all other v  ; ords that occur in ti~e phrase , i . e . on its arguments ( e . g . 
Qdeo ends on x and on y ) Just so Ous ~ ii-edv ~' ould be the definition that , on the con ~ . ~ r$~?7 , ellargt m~ents depend on the basic predicate . 
If we demonstrate this semantical dependence on a diorama  ,  _ =~ .   , ~ drav : the connect in C ! in ~ , provided , ~ ith , a narrow-head , directir ~ from an argument to a basic predicate ? At the same time  , ~ ul~k23 of course , accordi ~ to the position of separate words-if they are more to the left or to the right-we discern always the word-order  . Four primitive phrases from the preceeding paragraph are deomstrated in the following diagramm : We say that the sem~tical dependence is concerned because this relation ~ o ~ the basic predicate and its arguments  , expressed just by the theorem that objects denoted by the arguments are in relation defined by the basic predicate  , is quite initial definition refer ri ~ evidently to the reality  . The semantical dependence does not refer to a ~ th ing else than to the fact ofte ! li ~ some thi ~ of some thi ~  ( on the mathematical level the fact of tell i ~ ~ l  . ~ ~  ,   ) can be transferred only on the basic relation of the adherence to the set  ) when one passes from the predicate Q to the binary relation Q ~ and puts down  ( x , y)@Q~) . 
We say further that in the primitive phrase the basic predicate is directly connected with any of its arguments  , i . e . two words of the primitive phrase cohere together when either the first depe~s on the second  , or the second on the first . ~hen illustrating the direct connectedness we can use the s~ediagrmr ~ like when il ! ustrat i ~ the dependence  , but we do not pay attention to arrow-heads . Thus , evidently in P " man " is directly connected ~ ulik  25 by the referrin means ( there are e . g . pronouns , definite articles and si ~: ~! ar ) , but sometimes these are concealed and in this case it will be necessary to complete the text  ( or not to admit such a text at all )  . If there are everywhere the referring means expressed  , they are possible to be used for further identification of the v~ords of single diagran ~ Is for separate p ~ r as ~ s ~ analogously as it was mentioned at the primitive phrases  )  , and thereby to get the diagramms of the semantical dependence  , eventually even the dependence for the whole text . 
In the case of the whoie-text-diagr&v~two cases are possible : either there is a com~ected graph and then we say that the connected text is concerned  , or this graph is disconnected and then we say that the text is disconnected  . But , any disconnected text splits , in a natural way , into its connected components and it is evident that it will be possible to translate these components independently on themselves  ( because they do not cohere together semantically )  . 
Therefore we can concern only a connected context T  . 
According to the section 2T = ( SI . S2 .   . . . Sk ) , where Si are sentences and were mind that the condition  ( 2 ) resp . (5) is notal ! ways satisfied , because e . g . sometimes it is necessary to know 3 how the sentence SI was translated , when we want to translate correctly the sentence $2~ But now it is simple to see that there is exactely one word WI in SI and  ~2 in S 2 such that WI and W 2 are directly connected ? Therefore we may express a hypothesis that it is sufficient to store same informations con-oerning the single word WI instead of the whole translation of SI  . 
~ ulik 26
In other words these informations concerning WI are the necessary context  , when we want to translate conectly $2 o
It is similar in other cases ?'~ at concerns the translation of the particular sentences which are decomposed into the primitive phrases the main principales are described in  \[4  . \]  , because it is easy to indtroduced to each primi tive phrase a corresponding as in a phrases t ructer grammar il \] or ule bull k  2   7
