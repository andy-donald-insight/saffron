This paper describes a syllable-based computational model for the Korean morphology  . In this model , morpholovical analysis is considered as a process of candidate Generation and candidate selection  . 
In order to increase tile performance of the system  , the number of candidates is highly reduced and tim system require  . ssmall number of dictionary accesses . Idiosynchratic features of a syllable , formalized as a characteristic fnnetion , make it possible to reject implausible candklates before dictionary confirmation  , instead of a letter , syllable is a basic processing unit for the practical implementation of the morphological analyzer  . 
1. Introduction
There are two linguistic phenomena that are interested in Iheprocessing of computational morphology  . They are morphological transformation and morpheme identification  . Two-level model and syllable--based formalism focussed on the problem of morl  ) hological h'ansformntion
IBear 88, Cahig 0, Kosk 83\] . Morpheme identification is an importmlt issue in some languages where two or more morphemes ave combined to make a word  , a compound word , or a sentence without any delimiters between morphemes\[  Abe86  , Chen 92 , Paeh 92\] . 
The goal of morphological analysis is to find the baseform of morphemes in a word  . 
It consists of a generation of analysis candidates and the selection of to n'cot candidates  . Analysis candidates are generated as a reverse process of word formation rules '  . 
morpheme isolation and morphological transformation  . Then , correct candidates are selected by the coherence restrictions among

2. Thel ) roblem
Two . -level model is widely known to be n eomputationnlly efficient method for the practical system on the condition thai them unber of rules is  smnll\[Bart86  , Kosk 88\] . 
Howew . w , when the size of the rule base is large it causes an exponential problel n  . In case of the Korean langttage , it is common that a stenl is succeeded by I , ,rammatical n~orphemes . If we use the twe-level model for a practical sys/eln  , a small set of phonological rules and a large set of rnorl  ) helne isolation rules are required because there are several thousand coln binalion  . ~ of grammatical morphemes \[ Zhan 90\] . 
in order to solve the problem , we can try a 2--pass algorithm . Allthel ) OS , ~ iblemorl ) hemes are isolated , and then do a phonological processing . It is also l ~ ossil ) letodoaphonological processing first and morphemes are isolated at the second Imss  . 
\ [ iowever , this Mad of solution causes m ~ olller Selious problem that o  (  ; eut+sl't otll the conditional resh'ieions : (1) , ,: eme morphologieal transformation occurs not only at a stem but also at a functional inorpheme  ,   ( 2 ) there are eo occurrenee restrictions between two morl  ) hemes ,   ( 3 ) morphological tl'ansfovlnat\[ollOCCtll'S only for the El  ) e . cinlword grotlp . 
3 . Syllable-based writing system The writ in a system for most languaffes i  , ~; based on tile letter set called as alphabet . 
Instead of ' a letters e , t , Chinese writing consists of one or more letters  . Each character is a meaning unit and words are represented by the combination of characters  . 
In case of Korean , words are represented by one or more characters as in Chinese  . The difference is that Korean character is a wellformed written syllable  , which is a sound unit rather than a meaning unit as in Chinese  . A written syllable is a combination of two or three sound symbols  , which corresponds to a spoken syllable in a one -to-one  fashion\[Chun90\]  . Korean words are constructed as follows based on the syllable unit  . 
word : := syllable ) " syllable : := open_syllI closed syllopen_syll : := initial + medial closed_syll : := initial + medial+final  4  . Idiosy nehratic features of syllable There are  11  , 172 syllables in the modern Korean language (  =  19 initials * 21 medials * 27 finals plus one for null )  . However , it is i , )teresting to investigate the usage of syllables to make a word  . About 2,350 syllables cover more than 99 . 9% of the modern Korean words . Furthermore , 267 syllables (11 . 36% of 2 , 350 syllables ) are only used for the surface form of verbs , and grammatical morphemes are combinations of 151 syllables ( 6 . 43% of 2,350 syllables ) . In addition , only a very small set of syllables ,   1 to 46 syllables for each type of irregular verbs , are tied to the morphological transformation \[ Kang93\]  . This ldnct of information is very useful to improve Ihe efficiency of the morphological mmlyzer  . For example , if a syllable used only for the surface form of verb is found in a word  , we can easily guess that the word is a verb , the string before that syllable is a stem , and the rest is a grammatical morpheme . There is no other chance for the different result except typographic errors  . 
Suppose that X is a set of syllables that are used at the first position of grammatical morphemes  . We can easily guess the syllable boundary position of grammatical morpheme in an n-syl lable word at syllable  . v ~, where x j
X and i : ~ jKn . There is no the possibility at other positions . It is based on the fact that only 48 syllables are used for the first position of post l  ) ositions and 72 syllables for the first position of f in a lendings in the Korean language  . 
Three Idnds of syllable features are defined from where the features are extracted  . 
' Unit feature ' is a syllable feat m'e defined on the syllable itself  . If a syllable xi itself has an idiosynchratic feature J\]  , then x i has a unit feature g . ' Partial feature ' is defined by the component of a syllable  . A syllable x i is called to have apm'tial feature  1  ) ~ , if x i includes a component 1) ~ , as an initial , a medial , or a final letter . ' Successive featl we ' is a mete-level feature defined for the adjacent wo syllable features  . For example , if there is a set of two successive syllables xixi  , l that construct grammatical morphemes and that cannot construct any noun/verb  , then the boundary position of a grammat k . ' almorpheme is possible only at syllable xior
Xi ~ 1.
5. Characteristic function
Idiosynchratie features of syllables are represented using a characteristic set of syllables  . Suppose that a part of speech ( i ) , morpheme length(j ) , and the position of syllable in a word ( k ) are discriminating features of a characteristic set  . I . et IP i be a set of syllables that are used for a part of speech i  ,   ( ) j be q sol : of syllables Ihal are used for the morpheme length j  , and ~ k be a set of syllables that are used for the kthl  ) osition of syllable in the word . "\[' hen , a characteristic set of syllables A < i , j , k > is an intersection of Pi , ~ j , and ~ l . 
A < i , j , k > = Pi\["1 ~) jI " l~k
For the characteristic set of syllables
A<i , j , k > , characteristic function CA < ij , k > is defined fi'om A < i , j , k > to 0 , 1) . 
\ [ Definition \] characteristic function
Let X be a set of Korean syllables and
A < id , k > be a characteristic set of syllables morpheme length j  , and the k-th position of morpheme . Define the function
CA < u , k > : X - - - > (0, 1)
CA < i a , k >( x ) =\[1, if xEA<i,j,k >
L0, otherwise
A lot of characteristic functions are possible by the arguments i  , j , and k . 
However , some of them are chosen for the morpheme isolation or morphological transformation  , and they are reorganized as syllable infornmtion function  ( / ) in order to find out the characteristics of a specific syllable  . The value of f(x ) on a syllable , x is defined by the characteristic function CA < i , i , k > ( X ) . Suppose that a be then u in ber of parts of speech ,   /3 be the maximum number of syllables in a word , then a lriple A < i , i . l , > can be transformed into At by the following expression  . 
t:(k--1)*a*/~+(j--1)*ct- , - i(1 ~ iga , t ~ j ~ /3 , 1 ~ k . < B ) Let g be a flmction from a set of syllables to a Cartesian product of characteristic functions and h be a function from a Cartesian product of characteristic flmctions to an integer  . 
Then , function K and h are defined as follows.
g ': X-->CA ~ xCA2x . . . x(;A,~~(X ) = ( CAI(X ), CA2(X ) .   .   .   .   . CAn(X )) h:CA1 XGA gX . . . XCA n----~> h(CM(x ), Cm(x) .   .   .   .   . CA . ( x )) : ~( CAi(X ) * W ( i )), where W ( i ) = 2 il

Now , syllable information flmction f is defined as a combination of handg  . Domain of the flmction f is a set of syllable and the range is a bitstring of integer where bit position tLs used for the specific feature and tile w fiue of the t-th bit means whelher tile syllaNe has the corresponding feature or not  .

C^<ia , k > is to check whether a syllable x belongs to a syllable characteristic function or not  . For example , b-irregular rule in Korean is described as follows  . Set'AT'is supposed to be a characteristic set of the last syllables of b-irregul ~ verbs  .

So , stem and ending candidates should be identified first  .

DICTIONARY ACCESS analysis result
Fig . morphological analysis
Overall view of the morphological analyzer is shown in the figure  . The first step is to find the morpheme boundaries using characteristic function for syllables  . Stem candidates are generated at the second step by the phonological rules  . Phonological rules are only applied at a syllable w\[i \] if and only if  w\[i-1\] is an element of a required characteristic set , and w\[i+l\]is the beginning syllable of other morpheme  . 
Following algorithm is to guess the beginning position of gralnmatical morpheme  . 
In the algorithm ,   GM_SET1 and GM_SET2 are characteristic sets for the fi , ' st and the rest syllables of grammatical morphemes  , respectively .

Algorithm . morpheme boundary 7 . Evaluation of the model There are two types of candidates for a word  . The first type is generated by the morpheme isolation at all the syllable boundary and tile second type is generated for each morpheme candidate by the phonological rules  . We can count the number of candidates as follows . Suppose that a be the maximum number of syllables that causes an inflexion  , /3 be the candidates for prefinal endings , and ?" be the maximum number of inflexions for one syllable  , in case of Korean , ct is less than n , 13 is 2 , and ~' is 3 . If a word consists of n syllables , then lhemaximum number of canclidates is 10n+8a+2  .

Q verb+suffix + ending: ( n-2 + a + B )  + ?' ( n-2+a +/ ~ ) 
C ( n ) = ? + ? + @ " @ + @ + ? ' ? = 1 +  ( n-l )  +  ( n2 )  +  ( n-l + a ) + fS ~?' ( n-l+a+fl )  +  ( n--2 + a +/ D + ?' ( n-2- , a + ~ )  =  ( 4+D' ) n + ( 2ct+gar+2f~+217~'-37-5 ) = i0n+8a+2 < ---17 = 2 ,  ~'=3
It is very inefficient to look up the dictionary for all the implausible stems and grammatical morphemes  . Only plausible candidates are generated using the idiosy nehratie features of syllable  . Now , maximum number of candidates is connted as a constant and tile number of dictionary accesses is highly reduced  . 
O@@@@@? 1-inorpheme word : 1 noun + postposition : 2 n Otlll verb verb verb verb+suffix + postposition :  2 + ending: 2 + prefinal_ending + ending: 2/~ inflexion : ? , (2+2/~)'" suffix ~ ending : (2~28) , 2"(2~2/3) C(n)-O~@+@+( , 1) + (9 + (6)  ,  (7 ;  =  2fl  +  42"  +  4/D ' t - 9 The previous algorithm has O ( n ) complexity because it tries to isolate function word at all the syllable positions  . However , if syllable features are used then the worst- -time complexity of the Korean morphological analysis beeoines a constant  . In this case , we should uselhe fact that there is no stem that includes two successive syllables ' xy ' such that ' xy ' is a substring of grammatica I morpheme  . 
8. Conclusion
Syllable-based formalism is proposed to solve the problem of morphological alternation with morpheme isolation where many candidates are generated by tile phonological rules  . It improved the worst--time complexity O ( n ) to a constant , and timnuln ber of dictionary accesses is highly reduced using tile syllable features that are extracted froin words and formalized to be available for a morphological analyzer  . They are very useftfl for the isolation of morphemes  , which make it possible to guess the boundary position of a stem without accessing the dictionary  . They are also useful to reject the implausible baseforms from a w ~ r b  . 
Charaeter is licset of syllables and syllable-lmsed formalism may be applied for lhelanguages whose words consists of syllables and morphological operation is described as a syllable-to -syllable transformation to increase tile performance of tile morphological analyzer  . In addition , idiosynchratic features of syllable may be used for the analysis and recognition of imturn l languago  . s such as spelling check , phonological representation of words , and charactere cognition . 
Korean morphological analyzer was implemented at IBM-PC  486 tlsing C language . The system analyzed Korean text at a speed of about  100 words/sec .
