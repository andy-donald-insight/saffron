INTRODUCTION
The two-level morphology model ( Koskenniemi , 1983; Antworth , 1990; Barton , 1986; l(~itchie , 199:1; Sproat , 1992) is a wellknown comi ) u ~ , at , ional model of mor--phology , which ha ~ adaptability a ~ well ~ u ~ siml ) lic-ity . Int ) ractice , this mo ( Mha . sbeen successfully al ) - . 
plied to several anguages including Finnish , El@ish , Japanese , II , ussim h and French . However , the two-level model ha~been considered to l ) c in a pl ~ rol ) riate tbrKorean ( Kang , 1992; Kwon ,  1991) . That is , the two-level morphological nalysis of Korean is believed to be diliicuit and inf casible because the complex conjugation  ( in Itection ) a in lagglutination i word formation , and the syllable based representation of words may lead to a huge mml ber of two-level morphologic M rules  . In this paper , we show that the two-level model can be successfully applied to Korean and its rule size is limited to only  52  . 
This paper presents a successful two-lcvel system \[* or Korean morphological analysis  . The system wa . sba ~ edona shareware PC-KIMMO ( Antworth , 1990); however , wc extended the I/O component of I ' ( J-KIMMO to handle Korean alphabet HANUUL ; we c(m . ~ , ructed a Korean dictionary and a Korean morphological grammar  ( i . e . , morphotactics and spelling rules ) to t the I'G-K1 MMO ; wc also used a shareware KGI' ; N(Miles ,  1!191 ) to translate the linguistic spelling rules into the executable automal  , a(i . e . , tinite state transducers ( FSTs )) . This paper focuses on the dictionary and the morphologic M grammar for Korcal t  . 
TWO-LEVEL REPRESENTATION OF
KOREANWORDS
The two lewd model is conceLned with directly mapping bct w cent worc prescntations of a word :  ( 1 ) tilesur \] hcefo , ' m(SF ) ~ it appears in the text , and ( 2 ) the lexical \] or m ( LF ) which is represented ms a sequence of ba . ~ ic morphs and diacritics(c . g . , '+' to mark mor- . 
pheme boundary and ' ~' for word boundary ) . As a resuit , an input word in the two-level modcl is analyzed by mapping the word itself  ( SF ) to a sequence of le~ical forms in dictionary without intermediate stages  . 
In this section , we present a two-level representation of i ( or e~m words . 
' lb understand the two-level description for Koreanntor phology  , one should be properly familiar with Korean alphabet mid their transcription system  . So we tirst describe them . l " or ordinary writing system ~ the Korean alphabet consists of  40 letters : l0 purc vowels , 11 compound vowels , 14 basic consonants and 5 double consonants . A Korean word is represented with a sequence of syllables  ; a syllable can be made up of a consonant , a vowel , and a consonant ; there are scv- . 
eralt brms of syllables ( e . g . , CV ~ CVC ~ VC , V ~ and C forms) ; and initial consonant lett cr may not be distinguished front I in al consonant letter  , iiowever , the initiM consonant and the final consonant ii iust be distinguished from each other for successful two-level

KTPH systcm ; if not , it might cause a lot of useless work ( i . e . , invalid mapping ) and incorrect results because ith consonant in a word is not clear whether it is an initial consonant or af in M consonant  . Furthermore , to write two-level spelling rules for PC-KIMMO , each of Korean alphabet must be m~pped to ASCII character on the keyboard  . Therefore , we devised a transcription system for Korean Mphabeta ~ shown in Tablel  , which ha ~ the following features : ? There is rioletter corresponding to the initial consonant  , o ,  . We did not consider the letter because it is a sort of an orthographic filler \[' or the ordinary writing system and is not pronounced  . 
? The initiM consonant letters are not the same as the finM consonant letters  . ( Tosecthis , compare the initial consonants MYGODE ( I ) with the final consonants MYCODE ( F ) in Table 1 . ) ? Each of compound vowels is represented by a pair of two letters : a semivowel letter  ( i . e . , y or w ) and one of pure vowel IO , tersex cluding ' ql'/fi / and ' a\]' /5  /  ; here , ?\] , and '-~ t ' are treated as the compound vowels . 
? There are two archiphoncnic letters : ( 1 ) the archiphoneme A for the proper treatment of vowel harmony l  , which can bcchanged into NULL 1Modern Korean hmsa " diagonal " vowel harmony ( Ahn , 1985) kept in only one area o\[word formation , that is , between the tinal vowel of a verbal stem and the following o-initial suffix  . This system works in the 0-initiM suffix symbol 0 , a vowelletter a , or a vowelletter 9 by context ; and ( 2 ) the arct fiphoneme I for the proper treatment of predicativ c post position ' ol ' / i /  , which can be changed into either 0 or a vowel letter i by context . 
Wc believe that our transcription system makes it simple and clear to describe two-level spelling rules of Korean  , and it enables the two-level processor to handle elliciently the complcx spelling changes  . 
IIcre , three spccial symbols are used properly to treat lexical irregularities of K or cauverbal morphology : + for regularity  , X for'/c'-irregularity , and $ for all irregularities excluding the '/ d -irregularity  ; X must be differentiated from $ because of the following reasons  . In Korean morphology , most of verbal stem sending in the syllable ' ~' // i / are irregular  . The fi-nM syllable ' ~'/ / i / of the stem , when t bllowed by the vowel ' ? t'/o / and preceded by any vow clother than the light vowels  ( ' o'/a/and'22/o / )   , is changed into ' el '/ Io / and the consonant ' ~' /// is added to the preceding syllable  . We call it '/_'- irregularity . For exam-plc , the vcrb stem ' ~' ~ hi-i ~ ( to flow ) plus the suffix ' ot ' /0/ ( INFINITIVE ) becomes the verbal word ' ~ et'/hil-to/ . t lowever , there is ' le '- irr cgularity which oc-harmony where o has an alternation a if the final vowel of a verbal stem is a light vowel a or o  . For exampl % the verb stem '_W/bol ( to see ) plus the sullix ' oI ' / o / ( INFINITIVE ) becomes the verbal word ' Lo ~'/ bo-a / . t lowever , the verb stem ' ~' / cu / ( to givc ) plus the suffix '" t'/0/ ( INFINITIVE ) becomes the verbal word ' . ~ o\]'~co-O ~ . As a result , the archiphoncme A is used for the initial vowel o of suffixes  , which is to distinguish it from 0 elsewhere . 
5 36 curs in the same context ms'L'-irregularity : it causes only to be changed the following vowel '   o1' / o / into ' ~ t ' lie / ; for example , the verb stem'o1~'li-~/ ( to arrive ) plus the sn flix ' 0 t ' / a / ( INFINI'rlVE ) becomes the verbal word ' ?1 ~ et'/i-/i-to/ . Therefore , a mechanism is needed to treat them properly . 
One of the special symbols is used to represent a specific lexical form  , and is a hnost placed at tlme , d of tl le lexical form . For example , the verbal stem tubhast wo meanings , i . e . , " curved " as an adjective and " grill " as a verb  . Ill this case , the probleln is on the ditr crence between the variation \[ brine for adjective and those for verb  ; when it is combined with a sultix A , tim surface form becomes either the guile as adjective  , or timguw cas verb . ' Fo distinguish betw cen them , the following lexical fi~rms can be listed in dictionary : gvH + for regular adjective  , and guH$h)r'1\]'-irregular verb . 
WORDSTIUC TUREANDLEXI-

The word structure in general denotes knowledge of tin : internal morpheme combinations of known words  . 
As a result , it shows how morl ) hemes can combine to l ' or mvalid words ; it is important to a proper word recognition . In tim two-level model it is represented with linked lexicons  , i . e . , with coniin valioucla aaes of morphemes . 
The contimmtion chmses used in our lexicovs are as follows : i  . terjection ( IS ) , prenoun ( Pit ) , adverb ( A\]3) , noun(iNN ) , pronou , l(PN ) , numeral ( NU ) , verb ( VB ) , adjective ( AJ ) , verbalizer ( Vit ) , postposition ( PP ) , l-po~t position(I1') , nominal-prelix ( NF ) , verbal-preIix ( VF ) , preliual-ending ( PE ) , final-ending ( FE ) , nominal ending ( NE ) = , Begin , and End . Every class indicates a lexicon , lIowew:r , the 11c9iu and End are some special lexicons ; llcg in amounts to the ini-tim state in automata , and End hastile same role as the final state ; in fact , there is nolc xical entry .

TWO-LEVEL RULES AND FINITE
STATE AUTOMATA
Based on tilework of Korean morphology by Lcc ( 1991 )  ,   52 two-level rulcs has been developed for the Kor can morphologicallteruations  . By way of an example , we explain the following Korean morphological al ; ernation in the two-level framework . 
In Korcan , some verbal scnding in the final consonant B are irregular  . The final consonant B of the stein , when followed by a vowel , is changed in to w . 
But it is not changed when followed by a consonant . 
For example , when an irregular verb do B ( to help ) is combined with the suftix A , it is changed into dowa . 
hit he two-levd system , it is represented as follows:
Lczical Representation : do B $+ A
SuT face Representation : dow 0   0 a sentation and surface representation . In PC-KIMMO , such a correspondence is represented with the notation lezieal-eharacter:surface-eharacter like d : d  , o:o , B : w ,  8:0 ,  +:0 , and A:a . II erc the lexieal character 8 is a signal indicating that a basic word or stem followed by it is irregular  , and it corresponds to a surface O ( the NULL symbol ) which is not printed in the output form . The lexical 4- ( a morpheme boundary symbol ) also corresponds to a surface 0 . 
The above alternation may be described as the following two-level rule : B : w ? ~---  8:0   4":0 A : @ ( 11 Variation lgule ) This rule stales L hat a lexical 11 is realized as a surface w if and only if it is followed by the conjugation information  8  , thc morpheme boundary 4" , and a linking suflix A . A surface @ in the above rule stands for any alphabetic haract cr that constitutes a feasible pair with a lexical A  . For example , the surface@may bcrealized msa , c , or O wh crt all feasible pairs with l cxi cMA arc like A : a  , Arc , and A:O . 
The two-level rules cart be automatically translated into the state transition tables by using a rule compiler such as TWOL  ( Karttunen , 1987) and KGEN ( Miles ,  1991) . The tables built by KGEN may bcactually used in PC-KIMMO  . The above rule is translated by KGEN into the state transition table below :  1:   2  . 


5:6:7:111184" A@ ( lcxieal charaelers ) w@0O@@ ( ~urfacc characters )   2   5   1   1   1   1   0   0   3 O 0   0   0   0 O 4   0   0   0 O 0   0   1 O 2   5   6   1 i 1   2   5 I 7   1   1   2   5   1   1   0   1 The rows of the table represent the seven states , in which linal states are marked with colons and nonfinal states arc marked with periods  . The columns represent arcs fror none state to another  . A zero transition indicates that there is no valid transition from that state for that input symbol  . 

We have shown that the two-level morphology model , which has bccn claimed to be inappropriate for Korean  , can be successfully applied to Korean . That is , we have implemented a successful two-level morphology system for Korean  ( see APPENDIX )  . This system was ba~cd on PC-KIMMO which is a share-ware  . I to we ver , we modified the I/O component of PC-KIMMO to handle Korean alphabet HANGUL  ; we have constructed a Korean dictionary for the PC-KIMMO  , which contains about 12 , 000 entries ; we represented a Korean morphotactics for the PC -KIMMO  , which indicates the morphological structures of known words  ; we wrote 52 two-level spelling rules for the PG-KIMMO , which rc covcr almost all spelling alternations in Korean morphology  . 
Our two-level system has been experimented with 2 , 172 randomly words selected from Korean textbooks ( 413 , 975 words ) for elementary education . For this test set , the system produces the correct outputs although it includes about  5% extra incorrect analyses ( i . e . , overgeneration ) . II crethe overgeneration is ascribed to the fact that it results from the weak expressive power of morphotactic information in PC-
