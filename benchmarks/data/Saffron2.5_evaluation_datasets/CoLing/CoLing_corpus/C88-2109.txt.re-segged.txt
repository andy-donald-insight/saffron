To every element of the semantic representation some semantic categories will be  . operationally assigned .

Every semant k : ropre--seutation of " an illocutionary plau is an ordereds  , : tP ? < xb .   .   . x ,   , > , where xl is the verb and the remaining elements x2 to x , , correspond to the elements of the case frmnc of the verb aI  . For every element x of IP there is ~ l individual cou : itantint tm language  1  . 2 referred to as x * . The assigmnent of seman-tic-pragmatic categories to the elements of IP is a function  , which maps every pair ( x ~ C ) , where x e IP and C is the context , onto the semantic iipragmatic categories of x , representing the status of x with respect oC . 
The contextual labels are given ( g ) , chosen ( ch ) , mentioned ( m ) , mentioned in the previous sentence ( rap ) and , their negation - , ch ,  - , m , ~ mp . -~ g does not occur . These symbols build tile " alphabet A := ch , m , mp , -  , ch , -  ,   . t ~ rnp . 
The oFerational is at hm criteria ; we : ( t ) If ' x e IP , then : ( i ) if there is a property of lqs~mh that y ( ?* ) c  ~ ( 201 '1

1.4 Examples
For lack of space I will not give a detailed specification of the context  . In order to give an idea about the relation between the ! single arguments of the representation f the iilocutionary plans ' and their contextual status example  1 will be presented in rite following order : rule number  , assigned category and contexma ~ information . 
The arguments of the illocntionary plan
ADRESSEE , OBJECT > yield the following labels : < TAKE , (1ii ) ---> g(TAKE ) amk(TAKE *) eCO1 , ueq ( TAKE * ) eCOt ( 1 i ) - - -> g ( ADRESSEE ) hearer ( ADRESSEE * ) eCOt ( 2  )  - - - >  ( ( ch , - ~ m ) ( OBJECT ))
UHB(OBJECT*)ECO2
Therefore the new IP ' is < g(TAKE ) , (( ch , - ~ m ) (OBJECT ) )> and the application of rule ( 5 ) to the first and second argument and of rule ( 10 ) to ~ he ~ tirdurg ament of
IP ' gives
IP":<t(TAKE ), t(ADRESSEE ), f(OBJECT ) > .
The surface structure of the illocutionary plan ISP wonld be : " dunimms teinenretchKlotz " meaning "  ( you ) rake a red block " . Boldprint within the examples designate possible occurrences of accents and midedining highlights the words responsible for the cohesion of the surface tbrm  . 
Exanl 1 ~@2
Application of the rule to
IP = < PUT , ADRESSEE ~ OBY FCT , GOAL:>gives:(1ii)--->y(PUT) , (1i ) .   .   .   . > g , ( ADRESSEE ), (3iv) .   .   .   . >((-~ ch,m , mp ) ( OBJECT )), (4) .   .   .   .   . >(( ch,-,n0(GOAL)) . 
In this ease the new illocutionary plan IP ' is: < g  ( PUT )  , g(ADRESSEE ) , (( - , ch , m , mp ) ( OBJECT )) , (( ch , -m ) ( GOAL ) > . 
The application ' of rule ( 5 ) to the first and second argmnen L of rule ( 6 ) to the third and of rule ( 10 ) to the fourth argument of 1P ' gives IP ": < t ( PUT )  , t(ADRESSEE) , t(OBJECT)) , f(GOAL ) > . 
The surface structure would be " dustellstihu anf dentisch " meaning " put it on the table "  . 
Example 3
In order to illustrate the application of the salient opic rule we assume that the following utterance is made as a consequence of an illocutionary TAKE plan:"dunimmsteinen r~en undeinen blauen Klotz '  , meaning " take a red and a blue block " . Two iillocutionary PUT plans would follow : IP 1 = < PUT , ADRESSEE , OBJECT 1 , GOAL , > , 
IP2=<PUT , ADRESSEE , OBJECT2, GOAL)>.
For the first , second and fourth argument of the set 1P ~ and IP 2 the same conditions as in the above PUT examples hold  . For rite third argument the following rules apply  :   ( 3 i )   .   .   .   . >(( ch,m , mp ) ( OBJECT 1)), (3 iii) .   .   .   . >(("~ ch,m,-~mp)(OBJECT~)) . 
The new iUoeutio anryplans are therefore : IPI'= < g  ( PUT )  , g(ADRESSEE) , ((ch , m ~ alp ) ( OBJECTI )) , (( ch , ~m ) ( GOAL ) > , 
IP2'=<A , ( PUT ) , g(ADRESSEE ) , ( ch , m , - ~ mp(OBJECT2)) , (( ch , ~m(GOAL ) > . 
The application of rule ( 5 ) to the first and second argurn cntz ~ of rule ( 7 ) to the third argument in lPl ' , of nile (9) to the fl~ird , argument of IP2' and of rule ( 10 ) to the fbm~th arguments of ~? and IP 2' yields : IPI "= < t ( PUT )  , t(ADRESSEE ) j~(OBJEC q'I)) , f(CCOAL ) > , IP2"=<t~PUT) , t(ADRESSEF . ) , ~OBJEL~ ) )~f ( GOAL ) > oTt ~ surface slructure would be : " d~~l lstden r~t ~ a~f de ~ grt ~ nenmid den blanch anf denrote a ~ meaning " put the r ~_~' ~ I the green and the blue on the red "  . 
If in an illocntionary TAKE plan the third argmnent consists of list of many  obje6~  , then for every object OBJ ch ( OBJ ) ~ d-~m ( OBJ ) holds . This can be abbreviated by tl ~ oxpre ~ k ~ a ~ ( ch , - ~ m ) * of the formal language over tim ~ lphabe ~ A . For every ~ third argument of ani Uocutionary PUT plan file following hol & ~: for the first object  ( ch , m~mp ) , fbr the objt ~2 to ~ o ~ . 
(ch , m , ~ mp ) and for the last object (- , ch , m , " ~ mp ) . Tiffs can abbreviated by the expression ( ch , m , mp) , (ch , m ~- ~ mp ) * , ( " , ch , m , -mp)i ~ f"di~nit ; trustzwei/dreigtiirmKl6tz ?' , meaning " take three r~lblock ~' ~ isut ~ re~t then a colmsive succeding utterance should be " dustell  . ~ te~u . . . . eimm . . . . and eiimn / den letz~n . . . . ", meaning " put one . ., one . . . . and one/the last one . . . " , laxcase the take ~ block ~ , , were " two reds and a blue " the succeeding answers ~ u ~ tb  , : " da ~ te list einen ro~en ,  . ., einen roten .   .   .   . trodden-bha~m ~, ~,, . ." me~udug '~ put one red . . . . one red . ., and the blue . . . " ~ oE ~8~th > a~n ~ generation sytaem The coati , )l of the dynmnics of the conversation through the IM*I:  ; m ( ; nfi()ne , d(m ) , mentioned ill the previous utterance ( rap ) and the ma~ldng of uttermt c elements topic ( t ) and focus ( f ) are , ~ ! y two of the various subprocesses that run parallel during the mai~production processes  . In file automatic generation of natural la~g0age ~ si ~ ) oken ~ well as written , the thematic progression of a ~: equot ~~ ,  ~ ) fta~rar~ces and their formal cohesion must also be ~  , ~ken into consideration ? For the spoken lauguage prosodic cohe-sio ~ mu  , ~th c considered additionally . Our rules for the identifica-tio ~ of topic (0, . ~alientopic ( ~ t ) and focus ( f ) guarantees the coher ~ ; nc ~:: , ' the fl~ematic progression/DanEs 1970/ of two or more sncce , sive ut term ~ ces of the action sequence .

Rt : Tlxeo ~ ) iy tb cussed OBJECT of a TAKE-action becomes the topic a lizex lOBJECT of the following PUT fi action  ( ex . l,2) . 
~: The two/thrc . e focussed OBJECTS of the TAKE action become ~ ite OBJECT of the following  tw0/three PUT actions ~ nld wilt be labelled salient topic ( Ex . 3) . 
Oar topic , salient topic and focus identification rules also allows to m~ie predictions about the distribution of accents  . Indeed an accent will be assigned to the elements labelled salient topic  ( sO and fbcas ( f )  ; the topic elements ( t ) get no accents . In this phone of the work accent sale assigned to all arguments of the proposition  . The assignment of the accent to the adjective instead of the nou  ) ~ in phrases like " . . . denlx ~ ten . . . " involves application ~ of the same criteria inside lower level constituents  . In order to generate cohesive surface structures it is also necessary to know when to n ~ a definite article within noun phrases  ( the last one : derletzte ) or , oat indefinite pronoun ( one : ein ) . This choice depends on the pragmatic decision of taking one or more blocks and on the  ; properties shared by the objects in question . Under the t~ssurn pdon that only the parallel processing semantic and pragmatici  , aformation allows the choice of appropriate lexical material  . For this purpose , we will extend our set of semantic categories to expressiface  ( tain objects is art under determined or a determined element of a set  . /For an extende discussion see Pignataro 1!187 and Pignataro ( forthcoming ) / .
