On Semantics of Some Verbal Categories in English
Eva Ha Ji6ov ~, Prague
An attempt is made at such a description of the
semantics of some verbal categories that would fit in the 
functional type of generative description of language as proposed by Sgall  . In most analyses of the . relationship between the morphemic verbal forms and their temporal meanings that have been made in this sphere up to now  , the schemas employed proceed in two directions , that of temp-oral specification ( Past-Present-Future ) and temporal relationship ( Anterior-Simultaneous-Posterior )  , cf . for instance survey of these approaches given by R . L . AIIen , The Verb System of Present-Day American English , The Haag ,  1966 . Our investigation of the meanings the verbal forms convey has led us  , however , to the recognition of st least two other categories at the level of the semantic structure of the sentence besides those mentioned above and besides the additional indication in some forms concerning the time extension of the event  ( Immediate-Extended )  , namely that of Inclusiveness ( Inclusive-Nonin clusive ) and Aspect ( Re-sultetive-Completed-Processual )  . 
The status of these categories will be discussed and illustrated on English examples  , as we ~ las some remarks will be added concerning the possible application of our investigations  ( when confronted with Czech ) in the work on the problems of machine translation  .
