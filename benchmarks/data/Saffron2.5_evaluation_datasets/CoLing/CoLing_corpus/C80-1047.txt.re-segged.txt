The purpose of this study is to
analyze the statistical property of
Japanese characters for computer pro-
cessing . Sentences in high school textbooks and newspapers have been investigated in this study  . This paper contains the following points : the number of different words written in each character  , position of characters in a word , relation between word boundaries and character strings  , relation between parts of speech and patterns of character strings  , relation between parts of speech and each character  . 
The results of these investigations can be applied to the processing of written Japanese for practical purpose  . 
i . Introduction
There are several different aspects between Engl is hand Japanese in the information processing of natural language  . The first concerns the number of characters . In order to write Japanese more than 2 , 000 characters are used . 
The second concerns the way of writing.
A Japanese sentence consists of a continuous character string without any space between words  . The third concerns word order and other syntactic features  . 
Among these aspects , the second and third features are closely related to the characters  . 
Japanese characters consist of three kinds . AKANJI ( Chinese character ) is used to write nouns and the principal part of a predicate  , and expresses the concepts contained in the sentence  . 
AHIRAGANA ( traditional Japanese character ) is used to write conjunctions , adverbs , JODOSHI ( mainly expresses many modalities of a predicate ) and JOSHI ( postposition , mainly expresses case relations ) . AKATAKANA ( traditional
Japanese character ) is used mainly as phonetic signs to write foreign words  . 
Accordingly , Japanese characters are regarded as elements of words  , at the same time , they function to characterize the syntactic or semantic classes of words and express word boundaries in a character string  . 
The following Japanese character strings , ( A ) to(D ) , are the same sen-ten Ceswritten by using KANJI to different degrees  . 
( D ) is quoted from a high school text book ( world history )  . 
While ( A ) ,   ( B ) and ( C ) are transliterated from ( D ) by computer .  1 , 2  ( Example of Japanese sentence )   ( A )   ( s )   ( c ) l~l  ~ )   , D ~ t  ~ . s : ~~ s < : .  2 . D 620 t~t ~ O ( D )  --315-- ( A ) is written in KATAKANA ( only for ' ~-- D ~ , ~ ' ) and HIRAGANA ( the rests ) without using KANJI . 
( B ) is written in HIRAGANA , KATAK ANA and 200K ANJI of high frequency in
Japanese writing.
( C ) is written in HIRAGANA , KATAKANA and the so-called educational KANJI ( 996 characters )   . 
Low graders in elementary school tend to write sentences like  ( A )  . The older they get the more KANJI they learn and they begin to write sentences like  ( D ) in high school . When we read sentences like ( A ) , we realize it is very difficult to read them  , because we cannot find word boundaries easily . On the other hand , in(B ) ,   ( C ) and ( D ) we findless difficulty in this order . Because we can easily find out word boundaries by means of KANJI in a character string  . 
Boundaries between a HIRAGANA part and a KANJI part play a role to indicate word boundaries in many cases  . We can also grasp main concepts in a sentence by focusing our attention to the KANJI parts of the sentence  . 
Therefore , it is very important to use HIRAGANA and KANJI appropriately in a character string  . It is , however , hard to say the rules for the appropriate use of HIRAGANA and KANJI have been estab-lished  . Due to the fact , it is necessary for us to study more about the actual use of Japanese characters  . Because , explication of rules for the appropriate use of the characters is a prerequisite for information processing in commonly written Japanese  . 
2. Outline of Japanese characters
Fig . lillustrates the rate of total characters contained in the high school text books  ( 9 subjects X1/20 sampling )  . 
The data contains 48,096 characters in total .   3 HIRAGANA occupies the first place accounting for  47  . 1% . According to the result of Nakano's study which will be presented here  , KANJI takes the first place in the newspaper , because they have TV-programs and mini adverti sement which are both written mainly in KANJI  .  4
Fig . 2 i l lustrates the rate of different characters in the data of textbooks  . The data contains 1,525 different characters . KATAKANA and HIRAGANA are composed of basic 47 characters respec-tively , however the data also contains variations like small letters and letters with special symbols  , and both kind of KANA exceed 70 . Most of HIRAGANA and
KATAKANA were appeared in the data of textbooks . The data contains 1, 312 different KANJI . The more data is investi-gated the more KANJI appear  , and the rate of KANJI increases in the graph .

According to the investigation of Nomura 3 , 2 13 KANJI were found in the newspaper ~ The largest Japanese KANJ I dictionary  ( edited by Morohashi ) contains about 50 , 000 characters . 6
Fig . 3 shows relat ion between frequency and order of f requency in every kind of characters  . From Fig . 3 we see that a few HIRAGANA have high frequency . 
They play an important role in writing grammat ical elements in a sentence as

Order and Total up to the order 3 . Number of different words written in each character 
As we have more than 50 , 000 characters , it is necessary to decide the degree of importace of them  . In order to decide the degrees two criteria are assumed here  . One is the frequency of the characters . The other one is the number of different words in which the same character is used  . The similar concept has been proposed by A . Tanaka .  7
In Fig . 5 , axis X represents the frequency of the character as first cri-terion  . Axis Y represents the number of different words in which the same character is used  . The graph shows the distribution of characters in the text books except KANJI  . Each character on Y = I is used for only one word . For instance , HIRAGANA '&' ( o ) on Y = i is used for only one word ( one of case-JOSHI , indicating accusative case ) exclusively . 
Each character on Y = X is used for a new word in every occurrence of the character  .

KATAKANA are mainly used for writing proper nouns of foreign words  . The same words of such a category do not appear frequentry  . 
HIRAGANA , ' ~'( ru ) , ' ~'( i ) , ' ~' ( shi ) , ' ~'( tsu ) ,  ' ~ ' ( ka ) and '<' ( ku ) are localized on the upper right side . These are often used for writing some parts of inflectional forms of verbs  ( e . g . '% ~' for ' ~' , 'D ' for '5~~' , ' ~' for ' ~') . '~)'( i ) ,  ' ~ '  ( ka ) and '<' ( ku ) are also often used for writing some parts of inflectional forms of adjectives  . ' ~'( no ) , '? :'( ni ) , '%' ( o ) , ' ~'( wa ) , ' a ' ( to ) ,  ' ~' ( ga ) and ' ~' ( de ) on the right side are frequently used for JOSHI  ( post-position , expressing-case relations or other grammatica lre-lations  )  .  '~ ' ( ta ) on the upper right side is often used for JODOSHI of the past tense  .  ' ~ ' ( na ) on the upper right side is often used for the initial syllable of JODOSHI of negative  . 
Fig . 6 and Fig . 7 show the same invest igat ion into the KANJI of newspapers  ( the original work was carried out by

Fig . 6 shows the distribution of ( y ) the so-called " TOYOKANJI"selected by the Japanese government for daily use in  1946  . The upper right area on the graph I~8 is occupied by the so-called educational %
KANJI . Each KANJI on Y = i is used only for one word ( e . g . ' ~'( tai ) for ' ~~' ( taiho : arrest) , ' ~'( bou ) for ' ~' ( boueki:trade) , ' ~'( kai ) for ' ~' ( kikai:machine )) . The same as Fig . 5 , characters used for persons ' names are local ized near Y = X  . 
Fig . 7 shows the d is t r ibut ion of 5~ KANJI other than TOY OKANJI . The most of characters in upper right part of the graph are the ones which are used for persons ' names or for place names  . ( e . g . 
' ~' and ' ~' for ' ~' ( Eujisaki:person ) ' ~' for ' ~' ( Fukuoka : place )  . 
4. Position of characters in a word
For the information processing of
Japanese sentences , at first , it is important to find out word boundaries in a continuous character string  . If there are some characters which always come to the initial position or the final posi-t ion of a word  , these characters are available to find the boundaries  . 
Fig . 8 shows the position of characters in words . In the data of textbooks , there are 399 characters which are used for more than 6 kinds of different words . The characters on X=i00 always come to the initial position of a word . 
The characters on X=0 are never used at the initial position . The characters on Y=i00 always come to the final position of a word . The characters on Y=0 are never used at the final position . 
KANJI , represented with dots , spread over the area of Y~-X+i00 . Namely , the value of X+Y are always greater than or equal to  i00~ In other words , rates of the initial position plus final pos ition are always greater than or equal to  100%  . 
It means that all KANJI have a tendency to be used for the initial position or the final posi tion or both position  ( as a word of one character ) of a word ( short unit * )  . Most KANJI on Y = - X+100 form only words of two KAN JI . The tend-ency originates in the composition of words written by KAN JI  . This matter will be observed in section 6 . The group of HIRAGANA in the upper right area has a tendency to be used for JOSHI  . KATAKANA represented by ' ~' appear around the under left area on the graph  . Words written in KATAKANA have relatively long length  ( See section 6 )  . Therefore , the rates of the initial position and the f in alposition are relative ry decreased  .

N,JiN2J ~... V.(i)
Ni : Noun
Ji : Case-JOSHI for N ~
V : Verb
A Japanese sentence fundamentally belongs to pattern  ( i )  . Many nouns ( N i ) tend to be written in KANJI ( See next section )  . All the case-JOSHI are writ-ten in HIRAGANA . Stems of verbs are often written in KANJI and their inflectional parts in HIRAGANA  . So both a phrase of N~J& and V have such a pattern that the initial position is occupied by a KANJI and the final position is occupied by a HIRAGANA  . Therefore , the changing point from HIRAGANA to KANJI in a character string is always regarded as a word boundary  . On the other hand , a word boundary is not always a changing point from HIRAGANA to KANJI  . One of the exception is Japanese nouns ( long unit ) which are composed of some concatenation of nouns  ( short unit )  . ( See page 5*)
Fig . 9 shows one of the re lat ions between word boundar ies and character strings  . The graph contains 902KANJI ( total : 1 , 546) in the text books . The axis X represents the rate that the chan-ging points from HIRAGANA to KANJI correspond to word boundaries  . Each KANJI on X=i00 is considered as the initial character of a word if it is preceeded by a HIRAGANA  . The axis Y represents the rate that the word boundaries correspond to changing points from HIRAGANA to KAN-JI  . The symbol of '~' represents a KANJI .

The length of diagonal of '~' is propor-tionate to the frequency of the KAN JI  . 
In the graph , the length of 10% of axis is equal to i00 times of the frequency . 
6 . Parts of speech and patterns of characters tr ings In the investigation of newspapers  , 20 parts of speech were assumed .   8 Each part of speech has a particular pattern of character strings  . It is possible to decide the part of speech of a word based on the knowledge of such patterns in computer processing of Japanese sentences  . 
In Fig . 10 , ' K ' in the column of pattern represents a KANJI  , ' H ' represents a HIRAGAN ~ , and ' I ' represents a KATAKANA . The left side of the barchart shows the rate of total words  . The right side of the barchart shows the rate of different words  . 
Fig . 10-(1) shows the pattern of common nouns . The left side of the barchart shows that KK -pattern accounts for  68  . 0% of total common nouns in the newspapers . The right side of the barchart shows that KK -pattern accounts for  68  . 5% of different common nouns in the newspapers . 
Fig . 10-(2) shows the pattern of proper nouns . Most of the proper nouns also have KANJIstr ings  . The rest of proper nouns have KATAKANA strings expressing foreign words  . 
Fig . 10- ( 3 ) shows the pattern of verbal nouns which change to verbs with succeeding characters ' ~'  ( s e )  , '8'( sa)'b'(shi ) , ' ~' ( su ) , ' ~' ( suru ) , ' ~' ( sure ) , ' ~' ( seyo ) . The verbal nouns consist of KK-pattern up to 97 . 1% of total . If KK-pattern and succeeding characters ' ~' ( s e )  , ' ~' ( sa ) , ' L'(shi ) . . . are found , such a character string can be treated as a form of this kind  . 
Fig . 10-(4) shows the pattern of verbs . The verb of H-pattern is often used with preceding verbal nouns  . Most different verbs have KH-pattern . 
Fig . 10-(5) shows the pattern of adjective . Most of the adjectives are written with KH -pattern or KHH-pattern  . 
Fig . 10-(6) shows the pattern of adverbs . Most of the adverbs are written with HHH -pattern or HHHH-pattern  . Namely they are written in HIRAGANA . 
7 . Relation between each character and part of speech 
We have assumed patterns of character strings and the patterns are basi-cally available for c lassifing part of speech in actual data  . However , the patterns do not provide sufficient cri teria for the classification  . For example , the 68 . 8 19 . 8 2  . 4 2  . 3 7 . 5 ~ l 68 . 5 I 8 . 4 3  . 9 4  . 1 15  . 1

Fig . ii KANJI for verbs same pattern was found among different parts of speech  . In order to obtain more accurate results , we analyzed relations between each character and each part of speech in the data of newspaper  ( restriction : word-frequency ~3 )  . 
In Fig . ll the axis Y represents total number of the last 
KANJI in a word.
e.g . KKHH
T . last KANJI in a word
The axis X shows the rate of KANJI used for verbs . KANJI on X=I00 are used for verbs in the all occurrence of the last KANJI in a word  . 
The reliability of axis X increases according to the value of axis 
Y . In the lower area of the graph , the value on axis X seems to be discrete because of shortness of the data  .
