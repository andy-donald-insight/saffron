Analysis of a corpus of queries to a statistical database has shown considerable variation in the location and order of modifiers in complex noun phrases  . Nevertheless , restrictions can be defined on nominal modification because of certain correspondences between nominal modifiers and the role they fulfill in a statistical database  , notably that the names of database tables and columns  , and values of columns , are all determined by the modifiers . These restrictions are described . Incorporating these restrictions into Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar  ( HPSG ) has caused us to examine the treatment of nominal modification iHPSG  . A new treatment is proposed and an implementation within an HPSG based natural language frontend to a statistical database is described  . 
1 Introduction
A prototype natural anguage frontend to statistical databases i being developed as part of an Executive Information System for Rogers Cable systems  , a Canadian cable television company . The initial target database is the Rogers Technical Operations Database  , a relational database containing statistical data describing aspects of the company's business related to customer service  . 
The frontend employs an HPSG chart parser . There axe numerous variations of HPSG ; we have chosen \[ PS87\] since it is the most familiar and widely published  . Our results can be extended to other variations . 
In the spirit of HPSG , we have avoided a proliferation of grammar roles and kept them highly schematic  . 
In developing the grammar for the queries in our corpus  , we encountered a selection of interesting noun phrase constructions which caused us to examine the treatment of adjunct modification of nominals within HPSG  . This has resulted in a proposal which should be of interest to other researchers developing natural language interfaces  . 
2 Complex NPs in Queries
We began the project by collecting a corpus of 68 English language queries from three senior executives at Rogers  . Our corpus contains constructions paradigmatic of a wide selection of natural language queries that he executives would like to pose to their database  . 
A selection of these queries are shown in (16).
(1) Give me the we . stem region out age log summary.
(2) Give me the system reliability performance.
(3 ) Compare the basic service problem statistics per thousand customers  . 
(4) Compare the terminal equipment problems.
The sentences contain complex NP constructions and there is a large amount of variation with respect to the location and ordering of the modifiers  . For example , most prenominal modifiers may also appear as postnominal modifiers  . 
(5 ) Vancouver system reliability performance ( 6 ) system reliability performance for Vancouver Prepositional phrases like for Vancouver can be viewed as an abbreviated form of the prepositional phrase for the Vancouver division  . 
The NPs within these sentences contain a great deal of syntactic ambiguity  . Consider the complex NP in (1) . The adjective western can either modify region or outage or log or summary  . Similarly , region could modify any of the nominals appearing to its right  . 
However , much of this syntactic ambiguity does not ACRES DE  COLING-92  . NANTES , 2328 AOt3"r199246 I'ROC . OI:COLING-92, NANTES . AUO .  2328 ,   1992 have a semantic interpretation it he database semantics  . For example ,   ( 1 ) has only a single interpretation although there are numerous syntactic analyses  . 
We have gone into detail about he corpus to show the rich structure of noun phrases and to motivate the reasons for the design choices in our semantics and grammar  . 
3 Complex NPs in HPSG 3 . 1 Overview of HPSG HPSG is one of the best known unification-based grammar formalisms  . It employs attribute value matrices ( called signs ) to represent lexical entries , grammar rules and principles . HPSG borrows freely from other formalisms . For example , the treatment of syntactic categories , syntactic features , and sonre of the principles are from generalized phrase structure grammar  ( GPSG ) \[GKPS85\] . The main syntactic ategories in HPSG are heads ( the head constituents of phrases )  , adjuncts ( traditionally called modifiers ) and complements ( traditionally called arguments )  . The principles of HPSG include the Constituent Order Principle  , Subcategorization Principle , Head Feature Principle , and
Semantics Principle.
HPSG contains three grammar rules for combining heads with complements  . 
(7)\[SUBCAT(\[\])\]-- , H\[LEX + , INV-\] , C"(8)\[SUBCAT()\]~a\[LEX-\] , C(9)\[SUBCAT()\]-- , H\[LEX + , INV+\] , C*One rule ( 7 ) combines a lexical head with everything but its final complement  . This rule can also be used to convert a lexical head requiring only a single complement into a nonlexical constituent sill requiting a single complement  . Anothe rule ( 8 ) combines a nonlexical head with its final complements  . Yet anothe rule ( 9 ) works for inverted constructions : those involving a lexical head that is marked for inversion  . 
As in GPSG , generalizations about he relative order of sister constituents is factored out of the phrase structure rules and expressed in independent linear precedence  ( LP ) constraints . The LP constraints are used by the Constituent Order Principle  . HPSG roles are immediate dominance ( ID ) rules . Consequently , a single ID rule of the form X-- , HA could describe a head constituent Heither preceded or followed by an adjunct A--the relative ordering of H and A is determined by the LP constraints  . 
3.2 Issues in the Treatment of Adjuncts
Nominal modification is treated ill HPSG by having heads that contain a set valued feature called AD -JUNCTS\[  PS87\]  . Each element of this set is a sign which describes a potential adjunct  . For instance , the ADJUNCTS feature for a noun will contain an entry for adjectives  , one for nouns , one for prepositional phrases and one for verb phrases  . 
An alternative , which was also discussed in \[ PS87\] and has been adopted in other grammar formalisms ( e . g . , \[ Usz86 , CKZ88\]) and some variations of HPSG\[Coo90 , Po 191\] , is to allow adjuncts to select their heads , t The head feature called HEADS contains a set of descriptions  , one for each construction that can be modified by the adjunct  . For example , the HEADS feature for an adjective will contain a sign for a noun  . 
In our corpus , a head has more possible classes of modifiers than modifiers have classes of possible heads  . For example , the set of modifiers for NPs and Ns(i . e . , NPs lacking determiners ) includes adjectives , nominals , PPs and even VPs ( relative clauses) . In ?3 . 4 we shall see that each of these modifiers can have only one or two possible heads  . Furthermore , the task of reducing the size of the HEADS or ADJUNC'rS set  , by discovering common semantic features for which a constituent can select  , meets with greater success if modifier select heir heads  . That is , one is more likely to find commonality among the constituents which an adjunct can modify than among the modifiers which a head can take  . Selections of heads by adjuncts permits a greater angeof subcategorization to be specified through default inheritance rather than explicit specification  . 
Some aspects of adjunct semantics arc impossible if adjuncts are selected by heads rather than head se-lected by adjuncts  . Predicates , both adjectives and verbs , have argument sructure which coerces their arguments into thematic roles  . For exanlple , the adjective modern imposes on its argument the thematic role of Theme  . ~It is not obvious how the nonrinal argument of the adjective receives its thematic role unless it is the adjective which selects the nominal  , parallel to the assignment of thematic roles by verbs to their NP arguments  . If modern selects its head , then the the ? matic role of the head may be specified in the HEADSI Cooper  ICoo90  , Ch . 3 ,   ?6\] looks in some detail at the arguments in favour of adjuncts selecting their heads  . 
2In\[Po 191, ?1 . 3\] , Pollard and Sagintroduce smantic features like AGENT  , GOAL and THEME within the feature structure containing the semantic CONTENT  . 
ACl'ES DECOL1 NG-92, NANTI . : S , 2328 AOt ~ T199247 PROC . OFCOLING-92, NA ~ rn~S , Auo .  2328 ,   1992 attribute and inherited by the head when it unifies with the HEADS attribute  . If instead , head subcategorize for their adjuncts , this information must be inherited in some other fashion  , perhaps through structure sharing from the adjuncts list  . 
The problem and its solution are evident when derivational morphology are considered  . The verb read imposes the thematic role of Agent ( Ag ) on its subject and the thematic role of Theme ( Th ) on its object . When this verb is coerced into an adjective by the derivational suffix-able  , the resulting adjective assigns the thematic role of Theme to its argument  . If adjectives electheir heads , then the derivational rule is evident . 
(lO)V\[SUBCAT(NPTh,NPAg)\]
Adjq-"able "\[ HEADSNTh\]
Given that adjuncts will select heir heads , a grammar role for adjuncts can be stated most concisely if we combine ahead with a single adjunct at a time  . Thus , our constituent sructures will contain an ADJUNCT-DTR feature which will take the adjunct as its value  , rather than a list-valued ADJUNCT-DTRS feature which would take a list of adjuncts as its value  . 
A head that is modified by more than one adjunct will require more than one application of the grammar rule  . 
One disadvantage of this approach is that a complex nominal like system reliability for Vancouver will have two analyses : one where the PP for Vancouver modifies the head noun reliability and another where it modifies the head nominal system reliability  . If the adjuncts rule combined ahead with all of its adjuncts at the same time  , there would be only one analysis . 
However , one could argue that there should be two interpretations for the phrase and that both should be reflected in the grammar  . Pollard and Sagnote that " there is evidence that noun-noun and adjective-noun structures share some syntactic properties with lexical nouns as opposed to typical common oun phrases  , e . g . they can occur themselves a modifiers in noun -noun structures "\[  PS87  , p . 73\] . They propose analyzing noun-noun and adjective -noun constructions a\[LEX+\] even though they have internal structure  . By adopting this treatment of complex noun phrases  , we can prevent analyses for ungrammatical on structions like system for Vancouver reliability  , plus we can prevent ambiguity in the analysis of phrases like system reliability for Vancouver  . In our grammar we introduce two rules for adjuncts  , which are designed to give wide coverage and to avoid spurious ambiguities  . 
3.3 Two Rules for Adjuncts
One adjunct grammar rule is required for combining saturated lexical adjuncts with their heads  . That is , for lexical adjuncts which have empty subcategorization lists  , like adjectives , proper nouns ( specifically , the proper nouns corresponding to months and cities  ) and adverbs . The rule will be restricted so that it will apply to phrases with unsaturated heads  . Heads that fall into this category are Ns , PPs , 3 VPs , and APs . The specific pairing of adjuncts to heads is determined by the HEADS feature of the adjunct  ( ?3 . 4) . Additionally , if the head modified by the adjunct is marked\[ LEX+\] then the resulting constituent will also be\[LEX +  , thus implementing the analysis of adj-noun and noun-noun constructions discussed in the previous ection  . Using the schematic notation for grammar rules introduced in \[  PS87\]  , we can present the rule as shown in (11) . 
(11)\[SUBCAT(\[\]) , LEX\[~\]\]--+H\[LEXE\]\] , A\[SUBCAT ( ) , LEX + , HEADS . . . H . . . \] Note that the two appearances of \[\] in ( 11 ) indicate that the head and the resulting constituent share the same value for their LEX features  . The Subcategorization Principle will ensure that the head and the resulting constituent will have the same value for their SUBCAT features  . Since the grammar rule is an ID rule , it does not place any restriction on the linear ordering of the head  ( H ) and adjunct ( A )  . This rule is designed so that it applies before a head is combined with its final complement  ( 8 )  . It can be viewed as the HPSG counterpart to the adjunct rule from X bar theory \[  Cho82\] shown below , where the ADJUNCT is required to be lexical and not subcategoriz  , e for any arguments . 
(12) X --- , XADJUNCT in order for heads to be modified by unsaturated adjuncts  , we propose a second grammar rule . 
(13)\[ SUBCAT(\[\]) , LEX\[\]\]~H\[LEX\[\]\] , 
A\[SUBCAT(\[\]), LEX ~\],
HEADS . . . H . . . \] ~ Like\[PS 87, p . 70\] , we propose that propositions have two elements on their subcategorization list  , the first being the prepositional object and the second its subject  . APP is obtained by combining a preposition with its object NE We do not propose lexical entries for prepositions having only the object NP on its SUBCAT list since this would complicate he LP roles  ( ~3 . 5) and grammar rules (7) and (8) . 
AO'ES DECOLING-92 , NANTES , 2328 AO(rl "199248 PROC . OFCOLING-92 . NAI ' rrEs , AUG .  2328 , 1992 Rule ( 13 ) requires the adjunct to have a single element in its SUBCAT list  , thus allowing PRVP and modiliers to modify PPs , VPs and Ns . Of course , the contents of the HEADS feature will restrict the ap-plicabillty of this role  ( fi3 . 4) . Unlike rule ( 11 ) which allowed a lexical adjunct omodify either a lexical or nonlexical head  , rule (13) requires the head , adjunct and resulting constituent to possess the same values for their LEX features  , as reflected by the coindexing wilh \[ j_-\] . With this role , a " lexical " compound noun can modify a lexical nounto yielda " lexical " compound noun  ( e . g . , N -~ N , N ) , ora ( nonlexical ) PP cannmdify a nonlexical nominal m yield a nonlexical nonrinal  ( N-~N , PP ) . 
Direct consequences of our two adjuncts ndes are that prepositions and verbs are not allowed to modify anything  ( these have two or nrore elements in their SUBCAT lists  )  , sentences or complex noun phrases cannot appear as adjuncts  , and NPs , Ss , adjectives , verbs and prepositions cannot be modifled by anything  . 
Our grammar does not prevent nouns from being modified  , since rule ( 7 ) can be applied to a lexical noun to yield a nonlexical nominal  ( essent i ' , dly , N ~ N ) . If we " allowed full NPs or Ss to be modified , the result would be a syntactic ambiguity which would not have any semantic relevance  . 
3.4 The HEADS Feature
The applicability of the two adjuncts gramma roles is restricted by the value of the HEADS feature of the adjunct  . For prepositions ( lexical entries with SYNILOCIHEADIMAJ = P )  , the value of the HEADS feature will be a set containing a sign for N constituents  ( N\[SUBCAT ( \[\] )  , LEX-\]) and a sign for VP constituents .   4 Lexical entries for nouns and adjectives will have a single element in their HEADS set  . 
It will contain a sign for lexical nouns , which in cht des compound nouns ( N\[SUBCAT(\[\]) , LEX+\]) . We are proposing that prenominal lnodifiers , like adjectives and ( compound ) nouns , will be combined with their head nouns before postnominal modifiers  , like PPs . 
We adopted this decision because applying modifiers in different orders does not result in any difference in the resulting semantic interpretation  . Specifically , the semantic representation associated with \[ the\[lsys-tern reliability \] for Vancouverl\] is the same as that  4In our corpus PPs do not appear to nlodify any VPs , so we can actually simplify the HEADS features o that it contains only the N entry  . 
for\[\[the\[system liabilityl\]lot Vancouverland\[theI system\[reliability tbr Vancouverll  . With our proposal , we obtain only one analysis to t the phrase discussed alx ~ ve  . Finally , in order to allow relative clauses ( MAJ =  V ) , we need only propose that they contain a sign for N in their HEADS set  . Ttms , we effectively treat relative clauses like restrictive relative clauses  . 
As was the case with PP adjt mcts , the same semantic representation is obtained regardless of whether the relative clause modifies an N  ( restrictive relative ) or an NP ( nonrestrictive rlative )  . 
3.5 Linear Precedence
We adopt the same LP constraints for heads and complement danghters as proposed in \[  PS87\]  . Lexical heads are required to precede their cmnplement  ( s )  , while nonlexical heads tollow their complement(s ) . 
Sister cmn plements appear in the reverse order of their appearance in tim SUBCAT list offlmir head  . The I , P constraint slot adjuncts require signs with MAJ -Aor MAJ:N  ( +N categories in terms of the chtssification present in \[  Cho821  ) to precede their beads , while adjuncts with MAJ = V or MAJ = P ( -N categories ) are required to follow their heads . Thus adjectives and nominal modifiers will precede the nouns they modify  , while PPs and relative clauses will follow the con-stituenls they modify  . 
3.6 Semantics
Due to the close relationship between syntax and semantics in HPSG  , we can avoid syntactic ambiguities which do not con'espond to distinct semantic analyses  . 
Semantic infomlation , consisting nfTYPE and content ( CONT ) , can be used to prevent ce Il . a in analyses . The TYPE of a complex constituent will betbes an ~ eas that of its head  . The Semantics Principle is responsible for creating the CONT of a complex constituent from that of its daughters  ( suh consfituents ) \[PS 871 . We adopt a version of this principle for building upsemanlic information for databases tntctures  , which we call the Database ( DB ) Semantics Principle \[ McE 911 . 
We incorporate selectiom d restrictions based on a semantic type hierarchy which in coq ~ orates a pects of the database design  . The Rogers Technical Opera ~ tions Database is a statistical database  ; that is , each table in the database contains one or mot x : category attributes  ( columns ) whose values define sets of entities of a single type  , and one or more statistic attributes ( columns ) whose values smnmarizc these sets . The AC'I~!SDP ; COLING-92, NAN rI~S . 2328 AO\[TI'199249 PROC . OFCOLING 92, NAN rI~S , At ; (; . 2328,1992s types set,/~time Io(: .   .   . 
Figure 1 : Semantic Typet tierarchy complex noun phrases used in natural language queries to this database consist of nominals  , or nominal modifiers which belong to five general classes : statistical type  ( stype )  , statistical set ( sset) , entity set ( eset ) , modifier ( mud ) and pre-moditier ( pmod ) . Each of these classes may be divided into subclasses uing information from the conceptual database design  . These five classes are arranged in a semantic type hierarchy as shown in Figure  1  . Using this hierarchy , we can incorporate selectional restrictions into the HEADS feature of modifiers  . Nouns like summary , sum , and ratio are used to refer to particular ( sets of ) statistics . Members of thesset class ( e . g . , log , performance , activity ) may be used to modifys types . Nouns from the sset class may be semantically vacuous  , that is , we assume that all requests are for some set of statistics and these nouns may not carry any information that can help identify the particular statistic sought by a user  . We allow ( compound ) nouns within the eset class ( e . g . , problem , outage , call , reliability ) to modify ( compound ) nouns of type star ( i . e . , sset or stype) . Adjuncts of typerood may modify subclasses of eset  . For example , a user can request either system reliability . statistics or service c~dls . The type proud may modify other modifiers and selected types of eset  . 
The selectional restrictions distilled from our type hierarchy are by themselves not powerful enough to eliminate all of the " spurious "  , ambiguities . Just as we can use the TYPE feature from the semantics of the sign  , we can also use the CONT to restrict possible analyses  . To do this , we have modified the DB Semantics Principle with an Adjunct Contribution Constraint so that an adjunct is required to contribute semantic information to a head-adjunct on stituent--in particular  , adjuncts must contribute references to database constructs -- hence the constraint disallows emanti-cally vacuous adjuncts from combining with a head  . 
A complex constituent like outage log summary , in which outage has semantic ontent but log makes no contribution of database information  , would have only one analysis . The noun log would not be allowed to

Table 1: Parsing Performance modify summary , but outage could modify log , and then outage log could modify summary . 
4 Implementation
Our treatment of complex NPs has been incorporated into the SX natural anguage interface\[  MC90\]  . The SX system uses grammar developed within the HPSG-PL grammar development system\[  PV91a  \] . The semantic representations built up by an HPSG parser are directed to a module which converts them into an SQL query  . The query can then be directed to an Oracle database to obtain the requested information  . 
SX makes use of chart parsing implementations of HPSG developed in LISP by McFetridge\[  MC90\] and in Prulog by Popowich and Vogel\[ PV91 b \] . Chart parsing is a type of parsing in which all syntactic structures which are built are placed on a single graph structure called a chart  . Nodes in the chart correspond to positions in an input sentence  , with edges between the nodes describing analyses of substrings of the input  . A successful parse corresponds to an edge that spans the entire input sentence  . The performance of the Prolog parser on sentences  ( 1 ) - ( 4 ) are summarized in Table 1 . For each sentence , the table shows the time in CPU seconds for obtaining the first parse  ( Parse ) and for searching for all possible interpretations  ( Total )  . The table also contains the number of edges created by the chart parser while searching for these interpretations  . To illustrate the effect of the Adjunct Contribution Constraint discussed in  ?3  . 6 , Table 1 also shows ( in brackets ) the number of edges and CPU times when this constraint is not used  . The tests were performed on a SUNSPARC station 1 running Quintus Prolog 3  . 0 .
