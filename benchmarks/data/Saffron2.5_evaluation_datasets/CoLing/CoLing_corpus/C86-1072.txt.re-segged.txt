i . The following paper Js based on work done in the multilingual MT-project EUROTRA  , an MT-pro~ect of the European Community . 
Analysis and generation of clauses within the EUROTRA-framework proceeds through the levels of  ( at least ) EUROTRA constituent structure ( ECS )  , EUROTRA relational structure ( ERS ) and interface structure ( IS )   ( cf . Arnold/des Tombe/Jaspaert . 1985 and the EUROTRA-REFERENCE MANUAL , version I , revision 0) . 
At IS , labelling of nodes consists of labellings for time  , modality , semantic features , semantic relations and others . In this paper , we shal I be concerned exclusively with semantic relations  ( SRs )  , to which we shall also refer as " participant roles "  ( PR )  . A list of EUROTRASRs as given in ELS-3 is reproduced beiow:

According to current EUROTRA legislation , these gRs are assigned to dictionary entries of verbs  ( and other word classes , which will be disregarded in this paper ) by coders , and through these entries to clauses in a pattern matching process  . 
This approach , while certainly valid in principle , leads to the problem of inter-coder-consistency , at least as long as the means for identifying SRs are paraphrase tests for SRs  . In EUROTRA-D , we have for some time now been experimenting with a set of SRs  , or PRs , which are identified with tile help of syntactic criteria  . This approach will be outlined in the following . Its roots , are to be found in the literature on semantic cases in general  ( cf . 
Fillmore . 1968 and 1977, Starosts 1977, Somers . 198B ) and more particularly , in ideas from Systemic Linguists ( cf . Fawcett . 1980 and forthcoming , Ha Iliday . 1967-68 and \]985, Sl:einer . 1983 and 1985,
Winograd . 1983).
2. Definition of basic concepts
To start with , we need a small set of basic concepts , which will be define (\[ in the following . There is a basic distinction between Participant Roles and Circumstantial Roles on the semantic \] eve\]  , which the ELS-3 specifications do not contain . There is the further distinction between inherent and non-inherent roles  , which is also not explicitly made in ELS-3 and may be necessary at some point . 
Participant Role : A participant role is a semantic constituent of a clause which is syntactically reaIized as a complement rather than as a modifier  . 
Circumstantial Role : A circumstantial role is a semantic constituent which is  , on clause level , realized as a modifier rather than as a complement ~ oq ~ Participant Role : A semantic constituent which is  , on clause level , realized as obligatory complement Ojional Participant Role : A semantic constituent which is  , on clause level , realized as an optional complement Inherent Role : Inherent roles are obligatory participant roles and those participant roles which  , Jf they are not realized in a clause , lead to look up in the preceding text or situation for a referent  ,

The assignment of semantic relations , as presented here , has been worked out for German in some detail . 
The available literature for English , especially in the work of Fawcett and Halliday , shows that the treatment of English in the same way does not present a major problem  . It seems to be reasonable to assume that the method outlined constitutes a worthwhile way to explore for a multilingual MT-project such as
