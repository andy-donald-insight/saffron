Such graphs are called networks . An earlier example is to be found in MARCUS ~53   , Taking into@onsideratioa what has already been written at ~  ( i e . in remark 4) , the above graph so an be re-married as networks of binar ~ relatioms  .

ELECTRICAL ANAID GUES . If ~ g~aphlike ( 6 ) or ( 7 ) is considered to be a a electrical diagram where o a th word is substitut ~ by a contact  , and each arrow by an electrical conductor ( wire )   , the result is u electrical analogue of the grammar  . In this analogue if ome cIsses all comtee~8 correspomdlng to a semtemce , a contimuous electrical path is established and the curremt flows from ome extre-mity to the other  . The detectiom of thime urran @ is a proof of " grammaticality " for the word sequence under consideration  . 
Electrical analogues can be designed also algebraically  . For this it is necessary to proceed ~ S~o // Q~/ ~ from the list of sentences ~  ,  ~2 ,   . . . . ~/~ 8tar t tng

J = l-replace each ~/ by its coW ' responding rule of form  ( i )  , that is-io-pj--Ii = l-replace each ~/ and esch ~ i by the corresponding rules of type  ( 1 )   , and so on until the ~ lght member of the formula contains only the words of the vocabu lary  . Such a formula is ( 2 ) in example 1' We have no wat our disposal a formula enumerating the ordered n-~ples associated to all sentences of the language L  . This formula is to be interpreted in terms of switching algebra as follows s-an n-#~ple  ( Sl , a2 ,  . .?s r ) correspon ~ to a series connection of the elements al  , s2 ,  . . . ar ! - the union 6 ~/ correspond ~ to sparalel connection of the i = lelements ~/!- the Cartesian product ~ c~/?gi corresponds % o the paral~l connectio of all  . eri = ceotlosibl . where % In \[ #\] is presented an electrical analogue of the grammar described by graph  ( 7 )  . 
12 . GRAPHSOFTRANSIATIONS ~ This chapter and the following are intended assu~ested applications of the above discussion  , to the understanding of the process of translatlon  . No attempt is ma@f to start from more rigorous definitions  ,   85 may be found for e ~- pie in /6\] or \[7\] ? Here the process of translation of a simple sentence from language LI  , into language ~ , is regaz ~ led as consi % ring of the following operations sa  ) seek the given sentence in the d/ctions ry~-~i b  ) if the whole sentence is found in the d/otionary , write e ~ down the translation found there and ~ the process c  ) if tBe sentence is not found in the dictionary , divide it into two subst~i~gsadmitted by the gra-  . .sr ( in fact , immediate constituents ) ! d ) seek each of the substr/ngs in ~ he dictionary -   11 - e ) if one substrlag is found in the dictionar  ~  , write down its translation as given in the ~ ct to  . ar ~! f ) if one substring is not found in the dict ionar ~  , divide it again into two further substr~ngs and then proceed again as indicated under d  )  ! 6 ) the prooess stop ~ when a strin6 is obtained which contains only words belonging to the vocabulary of the language  L2  . 
A difficulty rises currently during the process of translation  , and this is due to the fact that many words , or strings composed of more than one wo~d , admit two or mo ~ e translations . Such is the case with homonyms . Special subroutines have been developed to solve t ~ e problem of homonyms in digital translation of language  . 
Suoh subroutines are based on successive step , of conditioned decisi ~ To quote only a few very simple examples  , MARCUS , in\[8J , gives ske ~ ohes of algorithms for translating into Roumanian " example " and " this " and for solving the homonymy of the French " p as " or ~ he English " this "? The problem is related to that of sequential  unde1~-s t and ing of s sentence , as described by ZIEREH \[9\] ? Let us put the DE oblem somewhat different ly  . To choose the writs word ( or subst~i . ~ between more than one possible variants , we need some supplementary condition , or conditions . A first and most important condition is that the right word  ( substT ~ g ) must match grammatically the other words ( subst~ings ) in the string . That is to say that the right word ( string ) must form with another word ~ subet ~ iag ) in the string an ordered pair belonging to a certain rela  . 
tion accepted by the grammar of the language ~ . In the graphical representation suggested above , the right word ( subst ~ , ng ) must find itself on a continuous path with the other words  ( substr~gs ) contained in the translation of the sentence under consideration  , For example , let LI be the Englis ~ language and ~ the French . Let the sentence in LIbe " we see the bo ~' . It must be-12-divided into ( we see )   ( the boy )  . Putting side byside the correa-ponding parts of the English and French graphs  , and marking by do ~ ted lines the mapping def in ed in the dictionary  , we can draw for the first substr/ng the graphue \ we\ 
IYno~'~\*"vois1\\1 ~ ~ voyazs ~ oiantI

We choose as translation only that subst~hg that closes our diagram  . 
Sim/ . larly , for the second substring the : Iq/I !/ ! j , /// le//?1/18/pleaboylt
Lgargon
The final translation is given by ( we see )  - ~  ( the boy ) li ( nous voyons ) L ( lsgarc on ) There are cases when the condition of gra ~ latioality is  . not sufficient . Then a human translator , uses supplementary information , like general knowledge of the subject treated in the text  , style used etc . Graphically , such information may be taken into account , for example , by assigning different colours to different types of subject Then the diagram must close through paths of different colour  . 
- 13 -13  . ELECTRICAL TRANSLATION . Let us assume now that we have at our disposal an electrical analogue N  ( LI ) of the language ~ , and an electrical analogue N ( ~ ) of the language L2 . We can further immaglne such an electrical connexion between the two ana-lo ~- ues that when a contact " ai " closes in N  ( LI ) ~ all contacts cor-respon Jding to the different possible translations of " ai " indica-ted by the dictionary  ~-~2 are closed in N ( L2 )  . Then , when a continuous path of contacts is closed in N ( LI )   , its translation can be only a continuous path resulted in N  ( L2 )  . For the selection p f ~ he type of subjector of the style used  , we can devise a switch that makes only the corresponding connections between N  ( LI ) and N ( ~ )   , or in N (~) and N(L2) themselves . Such a mwitch may have , for ex~nple , positions marked ? literature , mechanics , electricity , electronics , chemistry , medicine etc . 
Some texts may contain sufficient informat i on to enable the above switch to find automat ically its right position  . This idea ~ serves an entirely separated i scussion  . 
14 . CONCLUDING R~ARKS . What was suggested under 13 and 1@ are in fact examples of cabled logic . The implementation of these ideas for an enti relanguage may encounter tremenduous technica l difficulties  . Designing graphs and electrical analogues for limited parts of language may prove however useful for demonstrational purposes  . Thus it would be possible to achieve other models of language understanding and translation than those provided by digital programs and cunputers  . The author feels that this is indeed interesting , far as explained by ZIERE ~ \[9~ ~ the process of understanding must not be actually as divided into elementary steps as in an algo-x~thm--"Dazu kommt noch dass beim Verstehenderges prochenen Spra-chedutch den Menschen auchder soziale Kontext und das Erlebnis-verm ~ endes Menschenzum Abbauder angebotenen Information bei~gt  .
