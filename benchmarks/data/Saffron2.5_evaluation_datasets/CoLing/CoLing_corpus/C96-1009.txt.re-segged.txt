2 Collocations - The Problem
Collocations are per wtsive in language : " letters " are " deliw : red "  , " tea " is " strong " and not " pow-elful " , we " l'mt progrants " , ait dso Oll . Linguists have long been interested in collocations and the detinitions are nuiaerous and varied  . Some researchers include multi-o . leinente Oln pOu Ilds as ( ; x-amples of collocations ; some admit only collocations (: onsisl ; ing of pairs of words , while others admit only eollo ( ; ations consisting of a maximum of tive or six words  ; some emphasize syn-l , agl nat , ic aspecl ; s , others Selnmtl ; i caspects . The COlllill Oilpoini ; s regarding collocations appear to be , as ( Smadja , 1993) suggests l : they are m ' bi-l ; rary ( it is nol ; clear why to " Bill through " means to " fail ") , th('y are domain-dependent (" interest rate " , " stock market ") , t ; hey are recurrenl ; and cohesive lo~xical clusters : the presence of one of the  . 
collocate strongly Sltggesl ; S/ , tierest of the cello-cat , ion ( " Ulfited " couldiln ply " States " or " Kingdom " )  . 
the classiiics collocations into i ) redicative relations , rigid noun phrases and phrasal teln platcs .

It is not the goal of this paper to provide yet another definition of collocation  . We adopt as a working definition the one by ( Sinclair ,  1991 ) Collocation is the occurrence of two or more words within a short space of each other in a text  . 
Let us recall that collocations are domain -dependent  . Sublanguages have remarlm bly high incidences of collocation  ( Ananiadou and McNaught ,  1995) . ( Frawley , 1988) neatly sums up the nature of sublanguage , showing the key contribution of collocation : sublanguage is strongly lexically based sublanguage txts focus on content lexical selection is syntactified in sublanguages collocation plays a major role in sublanguage sublanguages demonstrate elaborate lexical cohesion  . 
The particular structures found in sublanguage texts reflect very closely the structuring of a sub-language's associated conceptual domain  . It is the particular syntactified combinations of words that reveal this structure  . Since we work with sublanguages we can use " small " corpora as opposed as if we were working with a general language corpus  . 
In the Brown Corpus for example , which consists of one million words , there are only 2 occurrences of " reading material " , 2 of " cups of coffee " , 5 of " for good " and 7 of " as always " , ( Kjellmer ,  1994) . 
We extract uninterrupted and interrupted collocations  . The interrupted are phrasal templates only and not predicatiw ~ relations  . We focus on the problem of the extraction of those collocations we call nested collocations  . These collocations are at the same time substrings of other longer collocations  . To make this (: lear , consider the following strings : " New York Stock Exchange "  , " York Stock " , " New York " and " Stock Exchange " . As-suine that the first string , being a collocation , is extracted by some method able to extract collocations of length two or more  . Are the other three extracted as well ? " New York " and " Stock Exchange " should be extracted  , while " York Stock " should not . Though the examples here are front domain -specific lexieal collocations  , grammatie Mones can be nested as well : " put down as "  , " put down for " , " put downto " and " put down " . 
( Smadja , 1993; Kits et al , 1994; Ikehara et al ,  1995) , mention about substrings of collocations . 
Smadja's Xtract produces only the biggest possible ngrams  . Ikehara et al , exclude the substrings of the retrieved collocations  . 
A more precise approach to the problem is provided by  ( Kits et al ,  1994) . They extract a substring of a collocation if it , appears a significant amount of times by itself . The following example illustrates the problem and their N  ) proach : consider the strings a="inspite " and b = " in spite of "  , with n ( a ) and n ( b ) their numbers of oceur-rencies in the corpus respectively  . It will always be n(a ) > n(b) , so whenever b is identified as a collocation , a is too . I to we ver , a should not be extracted as a collocation . So , they modify the measure of frequency of occurrence to become 
K ( a )  =  ( lal-1 ) (n ( a ) - n ( b ) )  ( 1 ) where a is a word sequence la\[is the length of an  ( a ) is the number of occurrencies of a in the cur-pus . 
bise very word sequence that contains an ( b ) is the number of occurrencies of bAs a result they do not extracthe substrings of longer collocations unless they appear a significant amount of times by themselves in the corpus  . 
The problem is not solved . Table 2 gives the extracted by Cost-Criteria ngrams containing " Wall Street "  . The corpus consists of 40 , 000 words of market reports . Only those n-grants of frequency 3 or more are considered . It ( : an be seen that " Wall Street " is not extracted as a collocation  , though it has a frequency of occurrence of 38 .

We , call the extracted strings candidate collocations rather than collocations  , since what we ac-cet ) tascollo ( : ations depends oil tile application . 
It is the human judge that will give the tinal de- ( : ision . This is tile reason we consider tile method as semiautomatic  . 
Let us consider the string " New York Stock Ex- ( : hange " . Within this string , that has already been extra ( : ted as a candidate collocation , there are two substrings that should / ) e extracted , and one that shou hl not . The issue is how to distinguish when a substring of a  ( : andidate ( : ollo ( : ation is a candidate collocation , and when it is not . Kita et al assume that the substring is a candidate  ( : olloca-tionifit appears by itself ( with a relatively high frequency )  . ~ lb this we add that : the sut ) string a I ) 1 ) ears in more than one , (: an ( li(lat(~'eollo(:ations , eVell if it , ( h ) es not appear by itself . 
" Wall Street " , for exaln ple , appears 30 times in 6 longer candidate colh ) cations , and 8 times by itself . If we considered only the number of times il ; appears by itself , it would get alow value as a candidate collocation  . We have to consider the number of tilnesit apI ) ears with in hmger candidate collocations . A second f a ( : to rist it ( ! number of the sehmger collocations . The greater this num-t)eris , the better the string is distribute . d , an ( l the greater its value as a ( : and i ( late collocat ; ion . We make the above ( : onditions more spe ( : iti ( : and give the measure for a string being a candidate coll  ( )-cation . The measure is called C value and the fa ( > tors involved are the string's frequency of o ( : eur-rence in the corpus , its fre ( luen ( : yo foe ( : urrence in longer candidate collocations , the immber of these longer ( ' andidate ( : ollocations and its length . Re-gar(ling its length , we ( : onsider hmger collocations to t ) e " more important " than shorter appear ii ~ g with the same fi'equency  . More specifically , if \] a\] is the length 2 of the string a , its C value is an alo-g ( ) us to laI-1 . The 1 is giv ( ms in ( 'e the shortest collocations are of length 2 , and we want them to be " of iln portan ( ; e " 21 = 1 . 
More specifically : 1 . If a has the same hequen ( ' y with a longer candidate ( : ollocation that contains a , it is assign e(tC-value(a ) = Oi . e . is not a collocation . it is straightforward that in this case a appears in one only hmger candidate collocation  . 
2We use tit (' , same nol ; ation with ( Kita et al ,  1 . 994) . 
2 . If n(a ) is the number of times a appears , and a is not a substring of an already extracted candidate collocation  , then a is assigned 3 . If a appears as a substring in one or more collocations  ( not with the same frequency )  , then it is assigned ( IIt ( . ) )   ( 3 ) where t ( a ) is the total frequency of a in longer candidate collocations and c  ( a ) the number of ttmse candidate collocations . This is the most complicate as e . 
Tit ( ; iln portance of the . Iluinber of occurrences of a string in a longer string is illustrated with the de  . nominator of the fraction in Equation 3 . The bigger then uln ber of strings a substring appears in  , the smaller the fraction num & ~ o\]occu ~ , the bigger the C value of the string . 
The algorithm for the extraction of tile candi -elatecollo  ( : a tions follows : e . xtract hengrams decide on the lowest frequency of collocations renlovetlle I > granls below this frequency l brall ngrams a  . of lllaxi Hlul Illength calculate their Cvalue = ( ' u-1 ) n ( a ) t brall substrings b revise t ( b ) revise c ( b ) h ) rall smaller ngrams a in descending order if ( total frequency of a ) = ( frequency of a in a longer string ) a is NOT a collocation else if a appears for the first time else 
C-v,,1,, . ;=  . (~ z ) J for all substrings b revise t ( b ) revise c ( b ) The above algorithln coinputes the C value of each string in an incremental way  . That is , for each string a , we1:(;(;i , a tuple (' n(a ) , t(a ) , c(a ) and we revise t t , et(a ) and , : ( a ) w flues . For each ngram b , every tin-leit is found ill a longer extracted t ( 1 , ) = t(b)+-(:(b ) = , -( t , ) + 1 . 
Ill the , initial stage , n ( a ) is set to the frequency of a appearing on its own  , and t(a ) and c(a ) are set to 0 .

An example:
Let us calculate the Cvalue for the string " Wall Street "  . Table 2 shows all the strings that appear more that twice  , and that contain " Wall Street " . 
1 . The analysi starts from the longest string , the 7gram " Staffl / . et ) orter of The Wall Street Jour-rod " . Its Cvalue is (: ah : ulated l\[romEquation 2 . 
For each substring seon ; ained in the 7gram , tile number 11 . 9 ( thel'requen(:y of the 7gram ) is kept , as its ( till now ) fl'equeney of occurrence in longer , strings . For each of them , the fact that they have been already l ' oun ( t in a longer string is kept as well . The refbre , t("WallStreet ") = 19 and c("\ gall

2 . We continue with the two 6grams . Both of them , " l ~ , eporter of The Wall Street Journal " and : ' Staff Reporter of The Wall Street " get  ; C-value = O since the y~q ) pear with the same l ' requeney as the 7gram that contains the ' re . Therefore , they do not tbrm candidate collocations and they do not change the t  ( " Wall Street " ) and the c ( "Wall
Street ") values.
3 . F /) r the 5grams , there is one appearing with al'requency ) igger than that of the 7gramit : is ( : ( ) nta , incd in , " of The Wall Street Jourlml " . 
This gets its Cvalue \[ romEquation 3 . its substrings increase their frequc mey of occurrence ~  ( as substrings ) by 2019 = 1 ( 20 is the frequency of the 5gram and 19 the fr 0 , queney it appeared in longer candidate collocal ; ions ) , and the num-t ) ero foe eurrence ~ ssu / ) string by 1 . The re-\[ore , t ( " Wall Street "' ) = 19 + l = 20 and c ( " Wall Street " ) --1+1--2 . The other 5gram is not a candidate collocations ( it gets C-value = O )  . 
4 . For tile 4grams , the " The Wall Street Journal " occurs in two longer ngrams and therefore gets its C value from Equation  3  . Fro in this string , t ( " Wall Street " ) =20+2 = 22 and c ( " Wall Street " )  -2+1=3 . The " of The Wall Street " is not accepted as a eamtidate collocation since it  ; apt ) ears with the same fl'equeney as the " of The
Wall Street Jom'nal'.
5 . " Wall Street analysts " appears for the first times oit  ; gets its C value from Equation 2 . " Wall Street Journal " mnl " The Wall Street " appearing in longer extracted ngrams get their values from Equation  3  . They make t ( " Wall Street " ) = 22 + 3 + 4 + l = 30 and c ( "Wall
St , leet ") = 3+\]+1+1 = 6.
6 . Finally , we evaluate the C value for " Wall Street " from Equation  3  . We find C-value ("\ ? all

4 Experiments - Comparison
The eortms used for the experiment siquite small ( 40 , 000 words ) and consists of material ? ot nth ( ~Wall Street Journal newswire . For these exper-ilnents we used ngrams of maxiln uln length  10  . 
Longer n-grains apt ) e a . ronce , only ( because of the size of the corpus ) . The , maximum length of the ngrams to be extracted is variallle attd depends on the size of the corpus and the application  . 
From the extracted ngrams , those with a fle-quc'ncy of 3 or more were kept ( other approaches get rid of ngrams of such low frequencies  ( Smadja ,  1993)) . These ngrams werelbrwarded into the , implementation of our algoril ; hm as well as our implementation of the algorithm by  ( Kita et al ,  1:)94) . 
The Cost-Criteria algorithm needs a second threshold  ( besidestile one fortile frequency of the ngrams  ) : for every ngram a , K(a ) is evaluated , and only those ngrams with this value greater than the ' prese threshold will take part totile rest of the algorithm  . We set this threshold to ; I again for the , same reason as above ( the gain we wouhlgel ; for precision if we had set a higher threshold would be lost on recall  )  . 
Table 3 shows the candidate c , ollocations with the higher values , extra (' Le(l with C value . A lot of eandidate , otlocations extracted may seem unimportant . This is becausetle algorithm extract stile word sequences that are fl'equent  . Which of these candidate collocations we should keep depends on the apt  ) lication . Brill's t ) art-of-speeeh tagger , ( Brill ,  1992) , was used to remove the ngrams that had an article as their last wor  ( 1 .

They do not consider nested collocations . 
( Smadja ,  1993) , extracts uninterrupted as well as interrupted collocations  ( predicative relations , rigid noun phrases and phrasal templates ) . The system performs very well under two conditions : the corpus must be large  , and the collocations we are interested in extracting  , must have high frequencies . 
( Nagao and Mori ,  1994) , extract collocations using the tbllowing rule : longer collocations and frequent collocations are more important  . An improvement to this algorithm is that of ( Ikehara et al . , 1995) . They proposed an algorithm for the extraction of uninterrupted as well as interrupted collocations from Japanese corpora  . The extraction involves the following conditions : longer collocations have priority  , more frequent collocations have priority , substrings are extracted only if tbund in other places by themselves  . 
Finally , the Dictionary of English Collocations , ( Kjellmer ,  1994) , includes ngrams appearing even only () nee . For each of them its exclusive frequency ( number of occurrences the ngram appeared by itself  )  , its inclusive frequency ( number of times it appeared in total ) and its relative frequency ( the ratio of its ac . tual frequency to its expected frequency ) , is given . 
6 Conclusions and Future Work
As collocation identification ( either in general language or in sublanguages ) finds many applications , the need to automate , as much as possible , that process increases . Automation is helped by the recent availability of largescale textual corpora  . 
In this paper we dealt with the extraction of uninterrupted and interrupted collocations focusing on those we call nested collocations  ( those being substrings of other collocations )  . Ainethodt br their extraction was proposed . 
In fllture , we plan to extend our algorithm to include predicative relations  . We are going to incorporate linguistic knowledge to improve the results  . Finally , this algorithm will be applied for term extraction  .
