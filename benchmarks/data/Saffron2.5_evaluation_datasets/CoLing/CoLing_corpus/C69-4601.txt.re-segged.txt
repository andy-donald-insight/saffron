A computer program for automatic identification of " full- 
form " case citations in legal literature ( e . g . , Rutherford v . Geddes,
4 Wall . 220, 18 L . Ed . 343; Southland Industries , Incorporated v . 
Federal Cc~mmlnications Ccm~nlssion ,  1938 , 69 App . D . C . , 82 , 99 Fo2D1 17 ) has been developed at the University of Pittsburgh and is now operational  . 
The level of performance of this program known as " The Citation Identifier " is high  . In a recent computer run , ~ ae Citation Identifier scanned the full texts of  191 randomly select-ed decisions of U . S . Court of Appeals ( some 400 , 000 words of running text ) and located correctly 2 , 220 fullform citations out of a total of 2 , 227 ( that is better than 99% of the total ) . Only seven misses and three false drops occurred . 
Of 2 ,   220 fullform citations which were located correctly , 1944 (87%) were identified perfectly . In addition , there were 276 partial identifications containing two types of errors :  ( 1 ) partial identifications in which some citation terms were mistakenly lopped off by the program  ( so called " short hits " )  , and ( 2 ) partial identifications which contained words that were improperly included in the citations  ( so called " long hits " )  . 
Both types of errors are for the most part easily correctable and can be largely eliminated by suitable changes in the program  . 

The Citation Identifier operates rather rapidly . In a recent test run , the total time required to process some 400 ,   000 running words of t~xt was approximately fifteen and a half minutes  . This speed could be further increased by suitable changes in the cc~uter program  . 
An extension of the Citation Identifier to reduced -form citations  ( e . g . , " The Geddes decision , "" the Southland Industries ease " ) is no ~ in preparation . 
Motivation for Automatic Identification of Case Citations in Legal 

Efficient administration of justice has often been hampered by the slowness ~ nd in efficiency of ordinary methods of legal information h~dling  . 
Because lawyers , judges , government attorneys , legislators , and others find access to necessary legal data often slow and inefficient  , they are frequently unable to act with the speed and the effectiveness which the circumstances may demand of them  . Thus , for example , members of the legal profession are often unable to procure  , promptly , exhaustive and accurate data concerning legal precedents of various court decisions  . This has often hampered the initiation of legal actions  , slOWed down the preparation of defense and offense  , delayed the preparation of new laWs , and other-Wise interfered with the efficiency of legal processes  . 
However , wise automation of certain critical areas of legal information processing could alleviate considerably the present crisis in legal documentation  . For example , a set of -2-comber progrs~scapable of exhaustive , accurate , rapid , and economical identificatio ~ of legal precedents in legal literature would do ~ ch to eliminate fr ~ legal documentation one of its most serious bottlenecks  . 
Since many or most legal precedents are referred to in legal literature by means of fullform and reduced-form case ci-tatiens  , ( e . g . , respectively , ' ~ ealy v . Penna . RR . Co . , supra " and '~ he Healy case ") , antc ~ atic identification of both forms of case citations would go far in the direction of automatic identification of leg~l precedents in legal literature  . 
However , a perusal of legal texts shows that automatic identification of fullform citations is both ~ ch simpler than that of reduced-form citations and also a prerequisite for efficient identification of the latter  . 
Therefore , construction of a set of programs for auto-rustic identification of legal precedents in legal literature has begun with the construction of a computer progrma for automatic identification in legal texts of full-fc~mlegal citations  . 
State of the Art and the Genesis of The Citation Identifier  . 
Practical work in legal aut ~ tie information retrieval has until now revolved mainly around :   ( I ) the preparation of co~cords ~ cestole galte ~ ts , (2) EWIC index in 8 of legal texts , and ( 3 ) matching of legal texts with the key terms of queries and inte ~ eet profiles  . These well-establishe ~ automatic information retrieval activities have met with considerable success  . 1'2"3-? In additioa , a sizable ~ mount of time and energy has been devoted to automatic construction frc~computer -readable legal texts of legal indexes and legal thesauri by means of various statistical techniques  . 3'4 However , to the best of our knowledge , these interesting procedures have not been incorporated into any practical legal information systems  . 
No previous attempts at autcm~tic identification of case names in legal texts have c~ne to our attention  ; however , this general type of activity has been extensively discussed by Casimir Borkowsi and derives directly from his efforts sdmed at automatic identification in texts of classes of words and of word Strings referring to various types of individuals  , objects , processes , acts , relatic as , groups , etc .  5 ,  6 ,  7 ,  8 ,   9 The Citation Identifier was first undertaken by Borkowski and his students in the Department of Cc~puter Science of the University of Pittsburgh  , in early 1968 as part of a workshop section of a graduate course in automatic text processing  . 
Research and development procedures adapted by Borkowski and his group were approximately as follows : A set of challenging but nevertheless resolv B ble problems in automatic text processing w~s presented to the class  , discussed , and resolved in a general way . A detailed solution of one of the probl~ns , namely , automatic identification of fullform case
J citations , w~s then worked out , flow charted and programmed in a high-level p rogra ~ language  ( PENELOPE )   I0 for the IBM 360/50 computer of the University of Pittsburgh . 
Computer-readable legal texts were made available to the class by Aspen Systems Corporation  ( formerly , the Health Law Center of the University of Pittsburgh  ) ~ and both the teacher and the students want to take this opportunity to thank 
A spen Systems for these data.
Since the termination of the original class room workshop project  , The Citation Identifier was reprogrsamed in 0S/360 assembly lauguage for Aspen's IBM 360/40 by Sperling Martins one of the students , who is also with Aspen Systems Corporation . 
The effectiveness of this recent version of The Citation Identifier constitutes  , along with an outline of its present structure , the subject matter of this paper . 
Structure of The Citation Identifier
Our rules for automatic identification of citations are essentially simple  . Fullform case citations in legal texts are recognized by means of s straightforward identification procedure whose main steps are listed below:  1  . Copy a sentence from a computer-readable document into an area in computer memory  ( hereafter , " the Search Ares ") . Then 2 starting at the beginning of the Search Area . 
2 . Search the text from left to right for an occurrence of " v  .  " . NOTE : The presence of " v .  "  ( for " versus " ) within a sentence is taken to indicate the presence in that sentence of a fullform case citation  . 
3 . ( A ) If " v . " is not found , return to 1 . above for next instruction . 
-5-(B ) If " v . " is found , record its Search Area location and go to # . below for next instruction . 
4 . Starting at the location of " v . " search the sentence from right to left for the first occurrence of a string of characters which m~t chese ither :  ( A ) A string of characters which is on a list of socalled " Left Delimiters of a Case Citation "  ( hereafter , " LD ") ( see NOT Ei . below ) , or else ( B ) A string of characters which is on a llst of so called ' potential Left Delimiters of a Case Citation "  ( hereafter , ' ~ LD ") ( see NOTE2 . below ) ? NOTEl : Entries on LD list ( of which there are approxims tely one hundred ) are: ( a ) words such as : " also " , " although " , " cites " , " cited " , " in " , " note " , " see "3" since " , " when " , etc . , ( b ) abbreviations such as : " c ? f . ", " e . g . ", " ViZo " etc . 3 and ( c ) punctuation m~rks such as : colon , semicolon , sentence period ( i . e . a period followed by two or more spaces ) , a question m ~ r k , etc . 
NOTE 2: The only two entries on PLD llst are the word " of " and the ccmm ~ punctuation mark  . 
5 . ( A ) If the character string to the left of " v . " wasmstch-ed by an entry on LD llst , then : ( a ) flag as the beginning of tkecase citation the first word to the right of that character string  , ( b ) return to the location of " v . " in the Search Area , 4-(c ) go to 9-belov far the next instruction . 
I ~0TE : The first occurrence of a string of characters to the left of ' ~  . " which m~t ches an entry on Left Delimiters List is interpreted as the first element outside the case citation  . In other words , we seek to locate the first occurrence of a string of characters Vhich is net within the wellformed formula for the " left me ~ aber " of a i ~ O_l-fo~m case citatio ~ or -- to put it yet another way--we are on the look out for the first string of characters which is in the cc ~Ixlement of the set of all formulas for the left ~ ersofc ~ secitations  . 
( B ) If the chezacte ~ string to the left of " v . " was match-ed by an entry on P~Dlist , goto 6 . below . 
6 .   ( A ) If the chs ~ acter string in the sentence was matched by the entry " of " on PT~list  , then ( a ) note its location in the sentence , and ( b ) check whether the text word which is to its immediate left is m~t ched by an entry on the list of so called " Resolversi "  ( see ~ i . below ) and go to 7 . below for the next instruction . 
( B ) If the ~ cter in the sentence was m~t ched by the entry "  , "( i . e . ac ~) on PLD list , then check whether the text word which is to its immediate right is on the list of socalled ' ~ esolvers  2"   ( see NOTE2 . below ) and go to 8 . below for the next instruction . 
ROTEi : List of Resolversi contains words such as " authority "  , " citation " , " l~w " , " rea ~ onlng " , " rule " , etc . 
2: List of Resolvers 2 contains words such as " Incorporated " -7-and " Limited " , abbreviations such as " Inc . "3 and " Ltd . ", and abbreviations of names of states : " Ariz . "3" Ark . "3" cal . ", etc . 
7 . If the string of characters in text was matched by an entry ? on List of Resolvers  13 then : ( A )   ( a ) flag as the beginning of case citation the first word to the right of the word " of "  3   ( b ) return to the location of " v ? " in the Search Area  , ( c ) go to 9 . below for the next instruction ; otherwise ( B ) Starting at the location of the ccsmm , continue executing the instruction 4 . above . 
8 .   ( A ) If the string of characters in text W as not matched by an entry on List of Resolvers  2  , then : ( a ) flag as the beginning of case citation the first word to the right of the comma  , ( b ) return to the location of " v . " in the Search Area , ( c ) go to 9 . below for the next instruction ; otherwise ( B ) Starting at the location of the contain 3 continue executing the instruction 4  . above . 
9-Starting at the location of " v . " search the sentence from left to right for either :  ( A ) The first occurrence of a sentence period 3 or ( B ) A string of characters which is a number , or -8-
W ( C ) A string of characters which matches an entry on the list of socalled ' ~ Bibliography Terms "  ( hereafter , ' ~ T ") ( see NOT Ei . below ) . 
NOTEi : Entries on BT list ( of Which there are approximately one hundred ~ nd fifty  ) are: ( A ) Words sad phrases such as : " affirmed " 3 " ante ~" at p84~e  "  3 " certoriemidenied " 3 " certoriarigranted " 3 " Docket " 3 " infra " 3 " super " 3 " supra " 3 etc . 
( B ) Abbreviations such as : " aff'd"3"A . L . R . ", " app . "3" Atl . ", " A . 2d " 3" Cranch . "3 " Cir . " ~" C . C .  "3 '7 . Supp . "3 etc . , and the names of states referred to in 6 . above . 
NOTE2: During this part of the program ~ an aut ( ~ nation is made to scan the " right member " of the citation to check its wellformedness  . During this scan , we are on the look out for all strings which are in the set of wellformed formulas for right members of fullform citations  . The right boundary marker is pl~ced to the left of the first character string which is believed not to be part of the wellformed formula for the right member  . 
i0 . ( A ) If the sentence period is encountered , then ( a ) flag as the end of the citation the string of characters to its immediate left  , ( b ) print the citation and go to 1 . above for the next instruction . 
( B ) If a string of characters in the text was either identified as a number or else was matched by an entry on BT list  , then go toll . below for the next instruction . 
-9-ll . Continue searching the text from left to right for either the first occurrence of the sentence period or a string of characters which matches an entry on BT list  . 
12 . ( A ) If a sentence period is encountered , gotol O . ( A ) ( a ) above for the next instruction . 
( B ) if the string of characters in the text was either identified as a number or was matched by an entry on BT list  , then continue executing ll . above ; otherwise ( a ) flag as the last element of the case citation ~ the word to the left of that chs ~ acter string  , ( b ) print the citation ,   ( c ) remain at present location in the Search Area and goto  2  . above for the next instruction . 
Effectiveness of The Citation Identifier The assembly language version of The Citation Identifier as reported here was developed and tested out on Aspen Syst~ns Corporation's ISM  360/40  . Legal texts used in the test were the decisions of the United States Court of Appeals  ( Third Circuit )  . 
In a recent computer run , The Citation Identifiers can-ned 191 randomly selected court decisions ( 45 , 942 lines of texts , that is some 400 , 000 words of running text ) and . located correctly 2 , 220 fullform citations out of a total of 2 , 227 ( that is better than 99% of the total ) . 
Of 2 ,   220 fullform citations which were located correctly , l ~9 ~ J 4 (87%) were identified Perfectly . In addition , the re-lO-

I were 276 partial identifications containing two types of errors : i  . " Shorthits " ~ i . e . fullform case citations in which some citation terms were mists ~ enlylopped off by the program ~ Thens ~ ber of such l ~ rtial identifications was  208   ( e . g . , " Carlinov . Zimblarte ~15~7,60" for " Carlinov . Zimblarte , 1927, 60
Ontario Law ~ e ~ a ~ s 269"), and 2 . " Long hits ", i . e . i ~ Lll-form case citations which contained terms which were imprOl ~ rly included in the citations  . The number of such partially c~rect identifications was  82   ( e . g . , " Gulf v . Schlumberger ~ is an ordinary civil action ") . 
The Citation Identifier operates rather rapidly . The total time required to process over 400 ,   000 running words of text and print out 2~220 full form citations was appraximately fifteen and one half minutes  .

The misses , false drops , and the remainder of partial identifications ( apprc ~ imate-ly 75 ) were caused by various incorrect assumptions incorporated 
I * Because some partial hits contained both short and long hitss the total of shorthits and long hits is greater th ~ n the number of partial identifications  . 
into the basic identlfic ~ tion routines . Thus ~ for example , the assumption that all right members of fullform citations terminate in strings of numbers and bibliographic terms has caused seven misses  8~1d nineteen long hits ( e . g . , the following string of words was identified as a single citation  , ' ~ c Cullough v . 
Cosgrave cited its previous opinion in Los Angeles Brush Corp  . v . 
James , 1927, 272 U.S . 701").
Similarly ~ the assumption that the presence of " v  . " in a sentence indicates the presence in that sentence of a fullform case citation resulted in false drops such as : " C  . L . 
McClain Fuel Corp . v . appells mt's contention that the case at barfe /_Is within this testimony "  . 
Sone changes in the structure of the main identification procedure are no Winl~relma-ati  ~  . A preliminary evaluation indicated that they should lead to further significant improvements in the accuracy and the speed of the program  . A preliminary evaluation indicates that by increasing the number of list entries by about a factor of four  , we would reduce the number of partial hits by about a factor of three  . Among required ne Wentries ~ fnich will be added to the list are : frequently mispelled words and abbreviatlons ~ left delimiters  , bibliographic terms , etc . 
We would estim ~ te that the introduction into The Citation Identifier of all modifications suggested above would reduce by a factor of five or six the number of partial identifications  . 


Discussion and Inter~pretation
We would like to emphaize the fact that the task which We set for ourselves was the solution of a ~ practical ~ oblem  . Consequently , we did not think it appropriate to commit ourselves to any strong theoretical view of ordinary language and sought instead to discover what minimal assumptions and what information may be pertinent to our unprepossessing experiments in automatic text processing  . 
Simple ~ hypotheses Concerning automatic identification in texts of case citations were selected by us with the intention of finding out how many correct identifications and how many errors they would produce  . It was and it r~nains our plan to amend these hypotheses on a continuous basis in the light of the results obtained  . We are , of course , striving for stronger theoretical underpinnings ; however , for the time being , we find it appropriate to operate with the least s ~ ount of preconceived opinion and of theoretical commitment  . 
Automatic classification of words and phrases in texts of the type described here can be viewed as a particularly simple case of machine translation fr~nordinary language  . However , the goal of The Citation Identifier is not translation into natural language but into classificatory language  . In other words , our program attempts a relatively simple many-tp -one type of reduction  ( i . e . classification ) rather than the extremely ccmplex many-to-many transformation of the ' ~ T " type  . 
More generally , it may be useful to view ordinary language as a macro-language containing certain special-purpose ml cro-languages  ( or ' ~ ini-lsaguages " ) -- each with its own structure which relative to the total structure of language is quite simple  . It may be of considerable practical and theoretical interest  ( a ) to investigate the structures and the interrelations of such mini-languages and  ( b ) to construct computer programs for identifying in te~ts the words and the word strings belonging to such mini-languages  . 
An ability to produce and identify autc~atlcslly words and word strings belonging to various speclal-purpose categories  ( i . e . mini-languages , each with its own set of gre~n , atl cal rules ) should be very useful in information retrieval because they play an important role in various systems for extracting and dlstribut ~- ing information  . 
Because many word strings which the algorithms such as this one attempt to identify have simple structure  ( " phrase:structure " )  , they can be recognized with a reasonable degree of accuracy by means of simple ccmput at lonal techniques  . 
The Citation Identifier is the first of a series of programs for automatic and semiaut cmatl c processing of cenputer-readable legal texts  . An extension of The Citation Identifier to reduced-form citations  ( e . g . , " the Geddes decision " , " the Geddes ease ") is nOW in preparation . In addition , The Citation Analyzer ~ ac~n puter program for automatic classification of fuSl-form case citations is also in preparation  . 
Several uses suggest th~nselves for a caa puter program capable of identifying cheaply  , rapidly , accurately , and exhaustively case citations in legal literature  . They seem to fall into five broad and overlapp in ~ categ ~ ies : i  . Aut~n~tic indexing and classification of legal literature  ,  2 . Establishing counts of occurrences of case citations in case law and instatutory law  ,   3- Determining ho~case citations cooccur with other words and phrases in legal texts  ( this m~ylead eventually to correlating case citations with points-of-law  )  ,  4 . Tracin ~ associations between case citations and construction of lists  , tables , and graphs which display such associations ,  5 . Providing an automatic ors ~ miautQm~tic service for answer-i ~ questions concerning documents in which a particular case or group of cases was cited  . 
Syst ~ As for aut ( m~tic identification of citations in texts and subsequent autc~tic extraction of case citations fr~n texts may be useful to many groups  , among the : i . Lawyers , judges , government attorneys , and other members of the legal profession ,  ~ . M~nbers of various legislatures , 3 . Officials in v~rious branches of the federal , state , and m ~ uicip algovernments ,  4 . Administrators in business , industry , foundations , labor  #finance , insurance , transportation , etc . , 5 . Sociologists sz~l~olitical scientists , and many others .
