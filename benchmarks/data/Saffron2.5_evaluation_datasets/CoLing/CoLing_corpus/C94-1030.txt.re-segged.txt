In optical character recognition and coni . in-uous speech recognition of a natural anguage , it has been diflicult to detect error characters which are wrongly deleted and inserted  . \] n<>r-der to judge three types of the errors , which are characters wrongly substituted , deleted or inserted in a Japanese " bunsetsu " and anl '  ; n-glish word , and to correct these errors , this paper proposes new methods using rn-th order Markov chain model for Japanese " l ~ anji-kana " characters and Fmglish alphabets  , assuming that Markovl ) robability of a correct chain of syllables or " kanji-kana " characters i greater than that of erroneous chains  . 
From the results of the experiments , it is concluded that the methods is usefld for detecting as well as correcting these errors in Japanese " bunsetsu " and English words  . 
Keywords : Markov model , error detection , error correction , bunsetsu , substitution , deletion , insertion 1 Introduction In order to improve them an -machine interface with computers  , the < tevelopment of input devices such as optical cha  . racter tea < l-ets ( OCR ) or speech recognition devices are expected , l lowew ; r , it is not easy to input Japanese sentences J ) y these devices , because . 
they are written by many kinds of characters , especially thousands of " kanji " characters . The sentences input through an OCR . 
or a speech recognition device usuMly contain erroneous character strings  . 
The techniques of natural anguage processing are expected to find and correct these errors  . tIowever , since current technologies of natural language analysis have been developed for correct sentences  , they cannot directly be applied to these problems  . Up to now , statistical approaches have been made to this problem  . 
Markov mo < lels are considered to be one of " machine learning models  , s in filar to neural networks a . nd fuzzy models . They have been applied to character chains of natural lan-g  , ,a~ges ( e . g . , l ); nglish)\[l\],\[2\], a . nd to phone me reco~gnition 3 . \[41 cha . ins in continuou speech .   .  \[ 1~1 . ?'2 nd-or de . r Markov model nt bunsets ' , lisk nown to be useful to correct errors in " kanji-kana  .

" sentences into " kanji-kana " sentences\[8\] . 
The erroneous characters can be classilied Ul , O three types , lhehrstisw ~ ongly recognized chal ; a clers instead of correct ( haracters . 
The second and the third are wrongly inserted and deleted  ( skipped ) characters respectively . 
Markov chain mode . Is abovementioned were restricted to tind and correct the first type of  errors\[5\]  , \[6\] . No method has been proposed for correcting errors of the second and the  . third types . ' Phe . rea . son might be considered to be I . hedi\[ticulties of finding the error location and distinguishing between deletion and insertioner I ' or s  . 
On the other hand , contextual algorithm utilizing , ,- g , ' at n let l . er statistics ( e . g . \[ . ()\]) a , ,d a dictionary look-ul ) algorithm\[10\] have been discussed to detect a . nd correct erroneous characters in English sentences  , which is segmented into words . 
This paper proposes new methods , which are able to be applied to a nor > segmented chains or " characters  , to judge three types of the errors , which are characters wrongly sub-st . it uted , deleted a . nd inserted in a Japanese " bunsetsu " , and to correct these errors in Japanese " kanji-l < ana " chains using mth of der Markov chain model  . The methods are based on the idea about the relation between the types of errors and the length of a chain in which the wdnes of Markov joint probability remain small  , l , ' urthermore , this method is ap-

Experiments were conducted for the case of 2nd-order and 3rd-order Markov model , and they were applied to Japanese and English newspaper arh cles  . Relevance Factor 1 and " Ree all Factor " R for erroneous characters detected and corrected by this method were experimentally evaluated using statistical data for  70 issues of a daily Japanese newspaper and 5 issues of a daily English newspaper . 
2 Basic Definitions and the
Method of Error Detection and Error Correction using  2nd-Order Markov Model 2  , 1 Basic Definitions In this paper , two types of natural lan-guage's sentences are discussed  . One is a Japanese sentence , which is non-segmented sentence and the other is an English sentence  , which is segmented into words . 
A Japanese sentence can be separated into syntactic units called '% unsetsu "  , where a ~" ( " bunsetsu " is composed of one mlependent word " and ~ sequence of n  ( greater than equal to 0 ) " dependent words " . 
A " bunsetsu " is a chain of Japanese " kanji-kana " characters or an English word is a chain of alphabets  , and are represented by 3'= sls2 . . . s , ~ , where s ~ is a " kanji-kana " character or an alphabet  . In particular , a chain ,  7  , is called a " J-bunsetsu " when all of its elements are " kanji-kana " characters  , and is called a "\[ iJ-word " when all of its elements are English alphabets  . These to feorre , ct . lapanese " bunsetsu " or English words is represented by Pc  . 
Three types of erroneous " J-bunsetsu " or
E-word are dehned as follows:
First , a chain ce = N , ? ~ . . . s\[Zlg ; . . , s , ; ~ is called a "( i , k ) -Erroneous J-bunsetsu or E-word Wrongly Substituted "  (   ( i , k)-EWS ) if a sube hain fl = tltu .   .   . I h is wrongly substituted at the location i of ce  , that is 37 C-re , -y = ~ ( o11/ < Here ~ ( Ollf3 do notes substitution of a subchain flat , the location i in a chain c ~ , that is ,   d01i  /  -8- iS- 2 ?"" Si--lll ? 2  "" ? \ [  , kSi -+ k "'" , S ' ~ n , and lI6--& , " '  , tk~--siq~- ,   . 
Next , a chain c ~= & g . , . .  . si~_lgi .   .   . s ; , ~ is called a "( i , k ) - Erroneous J-bunsetsu or I ' ; -word Wrongly Deleted "(( i , ~)-~WD ) if a subch Mnfl = t~t = . . . tk is wrongly deleted at the location i of a , that is ~7~ l'c , "y = c~(1) << f t . Here , ( 0 < < fl denotes insertion of a subchain flat the location i in a chain c  ,   , that is , a(0<<fl--s't . sS"'Si~-lltl2"""lk,qi''"S~n . 
Finally , a chain cr = . ? t?""s\[-lgi " " si-(k-1s;+k"'s; , ~ is also called "( i , k ) -Erroneous J-bunsetsu or F~word Wrongly Inserted "   (   ( i , k)-EWI ) if a sul ) chain / 3= tlt ~ .   .   . tk is wrongly inserted at the location i of % that is  37 EPc' , 7= d ;) >> f t . tIerec ~ ( 1 ) >> fl denotes deletion of a subchain f3 at the location i in a chain c ~ , that is , at0>>fl = . ? ~'2'" siZlsi + ~"' sZ , and tl = gl ,  ' "  , tk =
Si+k-1.
The set of ( i , k)-EWS , ( i , k ') - EWD and ( i , k ) - EWI are represented by P (~) s ' , P ~) and 17(1~) respectively . In this paper , all inputs " bunsetsn " or all inputs words to computers are assumed to belong to one of l-'c  , p(k)s , P ~) and 1'(1k) . 
Next , the meaning of detecting and correcting errors are define  . d in the Nllowing . 
The words , " error detection problem " , means the problem how to detect the location i of error in if  , and " error correction problem " means the problem how to replace an erroneous " d-bunsetsu " or an " E-word " ~ v by a correct " bunsetsu " or an English word  7  , where s , aEP , or ee EP aud'rcic . 
" Relevance Factor " p ( D ) and " Recall l ) ' ac-tor " R ( D ) fortile " error detection problem " is defined as follows : \]  ) : p ( D ) at ( the number of " J-bunsetsu " or 2''~" t ,  . of the \] , -word location i and length k error ill I ' ( k ) p ( k )  \]7 , 5k ) . s ' , " nor is correctly detected qhe total number of J-lmnsetsu or B-  )  /  , ,  .   .   , , word detected as erroneous , l-bunsets nor " E-word ") . 
(2): R . ( D ) ~_( the , mmber of " a-bunsetsu "~"? . or l~-word that the location , and length k of error in P ! s .  ~) , p ( k ) p ~ k ) ~Doris correctly detected )  /  ( the number of all "3-bunsetsu " or " E-wo , d " int , ,e set ) o , , :' ) p , ,epared in advance ) . 
"Releva . ncefactor " p ( C ) and " Recall factor " R ( c ) for the , " error correction problem " is also similarly defined  . Here pD ) denotes the " Relevance Factor " fortile " error detection prob-~  ( k )   ( c ) lem " of \] ~' , and RD denotes the " Recall Factor " for the " error correction problem " of p  ( k ) respectively . 
D2 . 2 The Method of Error Detect ion us ing 2nd-Order Markov Model We introduce the following assumption according to the experiences  .

In this paper , the effect to detect errors for cases of length k  =   1  , 2 is evaluated . 
2 . 3 The Method of Error Correct ion using 2rid-Order Markov Model The procedure of replacing erroneous chains by correct chains using Markov model is presented as follows : Procedure  3   ( Method of correcting the chains in r ( 2 or ) " bunsetsu " or words ~= s-lg2?""s ( l & ? ? ? si+h-lSi + horo := , ? ts~:~''"si "-- tg ~"" s ~+ ~- ts ?+ k "" s ~ denotes a "  ( i , k)-EWS " and a "( i , k)-EWI " and a sub-chain fl = tit = .   .   , tk is assumed to be wrongly substituted or inserted at the location i of cY respectively  .

Marker Model
The experimental results of detecting errors in English words using Ispell  ( Interactive Spellchecker ) is shown in Table 2 . l ? rom the results , it is seen that I spell cartal most perfectly detect erroneous words in U ~  , I '~) and Ps . 
using dictionary , but it cannot perfectly currect erroneous words , because it can output the correct candidates for erroneous words in p ~  )  , r(~) , pO ) s , but cannot output the correct candidates for erroneous words in F~~  )  , P (~) ~1)1F~~) . It is necessary to detect the location of er- roneous alphabets in words to detect MI these errors  . However , it should be noted that \[ s-pell cannot detect the location of erroneous alphabets in words  . 
In order to detect and correct erroneous " E-word " more effectively  , the method to combine I spell and the procedure ( in see .  2 . 3  ) using Markov model is expected ? The combinatorial method is denoted in the following way:  ( 1 ) At first , erroneous " E-words " are detected by Ispell , but the locations of erroneous alphabets in words cannot be detected by it  .   ( 2 ) Next decide the correct candidates words by procedure  3 and 4  . (3) Finally , ls ! ) ellagain checks if these candidates are correct words  . 
The experimental results using this method is shown in Fig  . 6 (2nd-order ) and in Fig . 7 (3 rd-order ) . From the results , it is seen that this combinatorial method of Ispell and the procedure by  3rd-order Markov model to very usefl fl to detect and correct all errors in English words  . 
It takes about 10 milli-see on ds and 6 seconds in average to detect and to correct erroneous " bunsetsu "  . Examples of " bunsetsu " and the output results of error de\]co-tion and error correction using Mm ! kov model  , are shown in Fig .  8 .
