DBMT is researched lm , ' e in the context of future systems for the general public  , where : tmonolingual author wants to translate into several anguages  . We have produced a complete mock-up , IADIA-1 , which demons lrale show ; French Ily per CardTM stack could lie translated into German  , Russian and English . We present I he cont putational , linguistic and crgononlic aspects of tile mock - tip  , and discuss them in the perspective of buikling an operalional prototype in the future  .

Our LIDIA project aims at studying the concept of ' Personal Machine Translalion '  , or more precisely , I ) BMT for monolingual authors\[Boitet&Blanch on 19931  , in a multilinguql setting . 
We have now completed the first imlflem cutalion of it mock-up  , I , I1)IA-1 . Working on ain ock-t\]p first , and no to q a prototype , has made it possible to tackle all aspecls of such future systems  , comlmtational , linguistic and ergonomic . Even if we could not solve all problems , we fell the ym'eput in perspective . Almost all other attempts in the direction of 1 ) BMT have consklered only some aspects of the paradigm  , leading to tmbalanced and somethnes inadequate architectures  . 
Ileforca demonstration which shows the principles of the Iralislalioli process  , we present au overview of the COltex\[of the il to ck-tlp  . Then , we give some more details about the mock-up ilsell  , I heimplem cnt : t tion techniques used and the principles of Iheinteractive dis:tmbigualion process  . Finally , we discuss some important poitlls ( interface , implementation techniques and tools , and disambiguation process ) of tile mock-up in the perspective of building an operational prototype in the filture  . 
1. Framework 1.1. The DBMT
Interactive MT was first proposed in the sixties by M  . Kaylot the MINI ) system\[Kay 19731 , iuld several projects expe , ' imenled with variations of this design , notably therl'S project\[Mel by 1981\] at Pmvo ( 75-gl )   , the Alvey N-tran project IWood 1989\] at Manchester ( 85 - 87 )  , the DLT project \[ Sadler 1989\] at Utrecht ( 82 - 88 )  , Ihe I . MT prqicct\[P , imon , et al1991\] from 1989 at seve , al IBM research centers , and the JETS project \[ Tsutsumi , et al1993\]font1989 at IBM Tokyol ~ abs . 
Ill KBMT-89 \[Goodmau & Nirenburg 1991\] : It CMU-CCI , , queslions were also asked by the " augmentor " if ambiguities could not bc solved by the ontology  . 
Among those projects where an interactive disambigtm tion component was\[nlegraled  , we were inspired by :- I he interface proposed in  KBMT-g9  , -- I he pattern-lmsed disambiguation process used for several  , ~ urfl figuities in t . MT , - the distriblfled " trchite clure of JF . TS . 
1.2. The LIDIA-I mock-up
We have chosen a well-define ( l silualion as regard to I he profile of I he task Imd the profile of the user  . We have integrated the use of an interactive disambiguation process at the very beginning of the design  . This means I hat the whole set of ctmslraints was well established before we starled the implement : ilion  . The tr:mslatiou process organization is described in\[Boitel&I\]lanch on  199311  . 
In the scctlario we propose , am(~tlolitigtl , lll \]: renchengineer creates technical documentation  , i the form of ? mIlypc , '(; ard stack , on a middle-range Mac into sh , and helps the system translate it intol:nglish , German and l ; ' , ussian . We have opted for a dislribuled architecture ( author wtrk station on am/leitllo sharid MT server on a  mini--IBM-4361  )  . 
We have l ~ roduced a demonstration stack id ) olittile linguistics ambiguily we have chosen to cope wilh in 

1.3. The demonstation stack
Our denlous lrali ( mstack , called ' I , II ) I Aleshistoires'is made of story cards ( Fig . 2) and treatment cards ( Fig .  1) .

a . Distributed architecture
Three machines ( Fig . 15) are involvc ( lin the Ii all slaliOll process . 
On die aulhor's workstation tile HyperCard Kernel sends and receives n less ages lronlthe LIDIA kernel which organists the translation process for each object  . The LIDIA Kernel sends transladotlj obstolhe Translation server vial he Communication serve /'  . The LIDIA Kernel also asks 1o prep are the disambigualion questions . 
b . Whiteboard approach
I gor each object to be hanslated , the LJDIA Kernel creates a mirror object ( it text file ) in which arcs to , ed all information required by lhel ranslalion process aml necessary for I he construction of tile target stack  . We distinguish Ix~twccn statictrod dynamic id /brmation  . Static in lormalion is whalisal tache ( I by llyper Card to each object . It is necessary to construcl targets lacks . I ) ynamic inlormation is any information used by l ADIA to translale the COllt cnt of all object  . 
These files can be constiered as whiteboard . v as defined in \[ Scliyman & Belet 19941 . Unlike Ihcblackboard , tile white board is accessed only by a coordinator  ( the IJDIA Kernel )  , nnd nol by tile compon cn ls ( Disambiguation kernel and Remote MacMain-Frame )  .

Figure 17: 2 patterm r12 is:
The disambiguati0n process is organized around a pattern marcher\[ Blanchon  199211  . For five out of the eight classes of ambiguity considered illtile mock-up  , we use a mechanism of pattern matching with unif ication of variables which allows to recognize tile ambiguity and produce tile disambiguation dialogue  . A dialogue construction method is associated with each pattern  . These melheds rely on a set of thirteen operators . 
Figure 16 shows the trees produced for the sentence ' Le capitaine a  rapport6 unvase de Chine . '
The p'tt terns ( Patron " i2&Patron 13 ) used to recognize the ambiguity in our example are shown in Fig  .  17 . 
The method associated with imttern'\]ke<te ( Y ) rll-~tQ ( Z ) l < trc\]-It : h % q e ( '\[ bxte ( '\[' )  , q t ~ t-o ( V )   ) which produces the lol Iowing text : Le eapitaine a  rapport6 tunvase dechine . ) The method associated wid \] pattern 13 is : "\[ t~:e ( V )   , ffbxte(Y ) ~ Ibxtc , ( Z ) ' l ~ : , xte ( T ) which produce stim following text : de Chine , lecapita in ear apport 6 unvase . 
4 . Towards an operational prototype 4 . 1 . Interface For a prototype , timmo dules for tile terminology and tile idioms should use  , at least , a lemmalizer , and with the text categorization module they shou Mnot rely onlly per Cardany more  ( Fig .  17) . 
Our implementation f the'guided kmguages'idea is still very primilive  . We hope to develop working techniques frolii our stu  ( lies on ' utlerence slyles ' and ' lexl genres ' . 
The inlerfaces of the standardization modtfles are only a first sketch  . The iconic buttons used to ask for I heuser intervention hgtve to be redesigned  ( we haven't fotmd a good solution yet )  . On Iheolherhand , the etu's or s fortile I31 ) IA tools and ( he feedback bulton sarchomogenous and could be kept  ( l : ig .  1 & 7) . 
Illa future work , it will be necessary to adap the dialogue type to the skills of tile audmr  . The kind of dialogue we have developed allows only the user t  ( t select the right an ' dysis . A new dialogue type could allow the user to get information and examples about lheam biguity currenlly solved  . The user could then change its text or insert disambiguating marks  . 
4.2. Implementation techniques
The current iml ) lementalion i terms of software antihard ware may be characle rizL : d  , as integrated , distributed and extensible . 

Using four servers ( LIDIA , I ) is ambiguation , Communication , aud Translation ) collaborating through messages and t cxl files as made it relatively easy to integrate tools running in different hardware attd/ors of  ( w , ' uenvironments . 
For using DBMT at home , a simple cmn munication server could pilote a modem to request services from a LII  ) IA server , exactly as a mailutility . With such au architecture , a low-cost personal computer would be usable for mt thoring and translating  . 
Using object-oriented programming techuklues makes the system easy to custo  , nize . 
4.3. Implementation tools
The dictionaries used by the Ariane-G5 lingwarcar c build from Parax\[ S6rasset & Blanc 1993\]  . For a prototype we need a more powerfull and flexible tool  , as also describe diu\[SOrasset&Blanc 19931 . 
For developing ( heling w are , we have used Ariane-G5 , designed for heuristic programming in the context of snblanguages  . We plan to develop some new Specialized Languages for l  , ingnistic Programming , thereby work iugiq the direction of ' ambiguous programming ' IB oil c  (  1993\] . 
4.4. Disambiguation process
It has b ceuclear from the begiuning that we would not be able to find  , for each class of ambiguity we have chosen to solve  , auuique resolution method . Keeping in mind the kind of dialogues we wanted , we have cx a miued a large quanlity of ambiguity configurations and have arrived al  9 problem patterns . 
The use of at strategy , organizing the disaml ) igual kmprocess , the use of patterns and methods implemented with a set of basic operators makc the process highly customizable  . That's why we think about an etwi , ' onment for the description of disambiguation pr ( mess . 
This environment integrates three modules : a n to dule for the pa  ( lerns definition , a module for the defiuition of the dialogue produclion methods  ,   ; rodfinally a module for the descriptiou of the disambiguation shategy  . 

The implementation of our mock-up I , IDIA-I , firs(concret experiment towards the I ) BMT'fo , " cvery Nxly ' , has been done ' in breadth ' at first , and ' ind cplh'o11 cerlaiu points . It was very important ot ackle all the aspects . Previous experiments have showl Ihenecessity of a broad conception for a MT system to succeed  , l ) uring ot , r work we have seen that tile ergonomics goals cau trigger compulational nd linguistic choices  . The situalion is the same for ( he compulati ( malor linguistic goals . 
The idea of the interactive clarilication approach in the context of natural language processing seems now to interest a real cotmnunity  . For MT , the current work of \[ Wehrli 1993\] , \[ Yamaguchi , et al1993\] , a tullhcongoing work on JETS\[Tsutsumi , et al 199311 arc some good examples . For speech systems , tile interactive clarification approach is also a solution as show niu\[Fraukish  , et aL 1992\] and proposed in \[ Ainsworth & Pratt 1992\] and \[ Saito 1992\]  . 
As far as 1 hel'tl ture is concerned , we have begun to study multimodal interactive disambiguation with ATR-ITL in a more general framework than  1  , 1DIA-1 . We hope to geladequate support Rr developing a more larger-scale prototype in the next few years  .
