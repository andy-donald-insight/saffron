1. Introduction
An \] , ; nglish-to-Korean mactdne translation system MATES/EK has been developed through a co-research done by KAIST and SF  , RI(Sys-tmns Engineering l . esearch Institute ) from 1988 to 1992 , and is still underewflution in KA1ST . It has several tools snpporting system de w ~ . lopment , such as the grammar writing language and its de veloping environment  , a set of augmented contextfree grammar for English syntactic analysis  , ; rod dictionary editor . This system has been developed for UNIX workstation  . 
MATES/EK was originally developed using
Common Lisp in order to test the possibility of English-to Korean machine translation  , and then it has been totally reconstructed using Clanguage  .

? Grammar Writing Language and Its Environment : MATES/EK runs a series of tree transformations on LSS structures from the English syntactic structure  , in order to get a structure specific to Korean syntactic structure  . To do this , a grammar writing language and the supporting system were developed for the tree transformations  ( Kweon ,  1992) . 
The whole tree transformations are done in a single grammar processing system in which a grammar writing language is defined and a set of tools  , such as the parser , the interpreter and some debugging facilities for the language  , are supported . In the grammar writing language , a rule describes a tree transformation by specifying the p~ttern of an input tree  , test conditions , the transformation operations , and the result an tree structures . Figure 2 is an example of a tree transformation rule written in grammar writing language and two trees before and after its apph cation  . 
MATES/EK consists of a set of dictionaries , a set of grammar rules , and the processing modules . 
Translation is done through a series of processes ; English morphological nalysis , English syntactic analysis , English semantic analysis , English-Korean lexical transfer , English-to-Korean structural transformation , Korean syntactic structure generation , and Korean morphologic M generation . Brief introductions to each processing follows . 
3 . English Analysis 3 . 1 . Morphological Analysis It incorporates the method of categorial ambiguity resolution using Ngram with rule combinations  , as well as the basic English word identification , such as word separation , processing of M tixes and recognition of idiomatic phrases  ( Kim , et M . , 1092) . 
3.2. English Syntactic Analysis
It uses the gener ~ flized Tomita Litparsing algorithm on augmented contextfree grammar  . Tile grammar is inductively constructed from 3 , 0 00 e ~ trefully selected sentences that include various linguistic phenomena of English  . Those sentences are mainly selected from the IEEE computer magazine September  1991  . Other sources of the test sentences are HP issue test sentences  , ~ ndI , ong man English Grammar Textbook . The constructed grammar for syntax analysis consists of about  500 rules . 
As described above , LSg ( the Lexical Semantic Structure ) is description for the intermediater p -resentation  . The result of syntactic analysis is transformed into an LSS which is relatively more specific to English  , and then is transformed into i il ( id 12:2: ( A ! ( 1~!  . - tmpl )   ( C !-- trap2 ) ) w i th  feature conditions , I_var . _lre?1) , I ' ; ; <~\'\\ actions StlC~l as _acti()n  / <2 ; '>0!

' . l The action part describes the necessary transformation operation  . 
an LSS speeitic to Korean.
3 . 3  . English Semantic Analysis We developed more titan  300 tree transforming rules that are written in grammar writing lawguage  . These grammar rules lead the English syntactic structure into a dependency structure of English  . This dependency structure is relatively similar to meaning structure but it is still specitic to English  , so we need more tree transformations to get a structure for Korean language  . 
head in an \]; ' , uglish dependency structure is a \]: ; n-glish verb word , the hexd in corresponding Korean dependency structure is Korean verb or a  , djec-live word , those two words are often not mapped directly , l " igure 3 is an example of transformation from an English syntactic structure into its English specilic dependency structures LSS for a sentence " Pipelining increases \]  ) erformance by ex-I ) loiting instruction-level parallelism . " 5 . Korean Generation 4 . English to Korean Transfer In this step the system looks up the English-Korean bilingual dictionary  . We manage the analysis dictionary separately from the transfer dictionary so that we may use the san  , e analysis dictionary to the other language pair such as Fmglish to Japanese with the other transfer dictionary  . 
There are more than 300 lexicat specitic selection rules developed to make the lexieal selection better  . 
4 . 1 . English-Korean Structural'l Yans-format ion Using another tree transformation grammar  , the English specific dependency structure is transformed into a Korean language specific dependency structure after looking up the bilingual dictionary  . The dependency structures are represented as head and dependents  . Although the 5 . 1  . Korean Syntactic Generation In this step the system transforms further the resultant structure into a list of Korean morphemes  . 
Since the dei ) endency structures l ) eeilies no word order , we have to lind the word order of a sentence and necessary postpositions by help of rules and lexical information  ( Jang , et a\] .  , 1991) . Note that Korean has , like Japane . s e , several alternative post l ) ositions l br conveying the same meaning . 
5 . 2 Korean Morpho log ica l Generat ion After the whoh : tree transformation  , tile resultant structure is a list of pairs of a morpheme and its category  . The morphologic M generator is an automaton that does the synthesis and separatim  , of morphemes according to the context and Korean morpheme combination rule  . Since the Korean language has some complex morphological structure  , the synthesis is a very complex process .

6. Problems for Evolution of the

Since after the first completion of this project , we have been trying to find and solve the problems of this system  . Following list is a brief list of those problems , and they are not seem to be easy to solve in the near future  . 
Robust processing for ill-formed sentences : Current MATFS/EK assumes that the input sentence be a wellformed English sentence  . 
After practical test , we found the robustness for ill-formed sentences i highly required  , because the papers fi ' oln the IEEE computer magazine contains the non-sential  , non-text text such as braces , numeric expressions , formulas and so on . 
Processing of non-continuous idiomatic expressions : In the dictionary entry specification we have a simple rule to represent he non-continuous idiomatic expressions  , but it is not easy to detect those expressions from a sentence and represent he found expression in the internal structure for processing  . 
Selecting correct word correspondency between several alternatives : MATES/EK uses the semantic marker and a scoring of frequencies to select the word correspondeney  . The system still lacks a strong strategy for the word selection  . 
Processing Korean Sentence Style : Ko-reau language has various styles of sen-tences  ( difference bt we ennormal ones from the honorific or polite expressions  )  , which are quite difficult to catch from the English sentences  . 
Too many ambiguities in English syntactic an Mysis : Currently MATES/EK uses a set of ad hoc heuristics and lexieal semantic markers coded in the dictionary in order to solve the ambiguity resolution  , such as the PP attachment . This problcm is related to the problem of selecting the right postposition of 

7. Test and Evaluation
EvMuation of an MT systeln enmrges as a criti-c'M issue these days  , but we have not yet found a strong and objective way of evaluation  . After the first completion of the project we tried though  , to make an evaluation of the system . 
In order to inake the evaluation as objective as possible we prepared three factors  . First , the referees of the evaluation should be those who are not the developers of the system  , and they should take a training to make objective decisions  . We selected randomly five master degree students as the referees  . Second , the referees are given a decision criteria of four levels : best  , good , poor , and Korean sentence is very natural and requires no additional postediting  . A sentence is ' good ' translated if the result sentence is structurally correct but it has some minor lexicM selection errors  . A sentence is translated ' poor ' if there is structural error as well as lexical errors  . By ' fail ' , we mean when the system produces very ill-formed translation or fails to prodnce any result at all  . We took the first three levels to be ' success , ' because vena sentence is translated in ' poor ' degree  , it is still understandable . ( Even if a translation is scored to be ' fail ' , it could sometimes be understandable from the viewpoint of ' mechanical translation  . ') Third , the test sentence should be those sentences which were never used during the development time  . 
This system was tested on 1 , 708 sentences , whose length were less than 26 words selected from 2500 sentences in the IEEE comtmter magazine September  1991 issue . It showed about 95 percent of success rate for sentence shorter than  15 words , about 90 percent for 18 words , 80 percent for 21 words , and 75 percent for 26 words . 
This is a quite encouraging result since the IEEE computer magazine contains wide range of texts of wrions styles  . 
8. Conclusion and Further Study
Development of MATES/EK gaw ; a strong motivation of attacking practically important problems  , such as dictionary management , scaling up the gramma rules to the real texts , controlling the consistency of a large system . 
The system MATES/EK is still under growing , trying to overcmne the problems listed above , scaling up the dictionaries and the gramma rules , and doing downsizing to the PC environment .
