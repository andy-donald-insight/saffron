Although there have beeo . studies of reference resolution Ib,'wmousaou . phrases in Japanese ( Shibata el al . 1990; Kitani994) , except Kitani's work , they do not clearly show how to lind the referents in comput a  . tionally i ) lausible ways for a large amount of data , suc , has a news t ) a per database .

The som ' ees of lh <' . newspaper articles are mostly lheNikk ci and the Ashahi  . '\[' h ( ! total number < ) l " the articles is 1375 , and there are 42 cases of doush a with gaamt 66 cases ( > f dousha with ka in the entire set of articles . 
The followiug tables , Table 1 and Tabh ' .  2 , show the locations and contexts where the referents of both subsets of dousha appear  .

Note for Table 1 and Table 2 company name referred to is a part of a larger subject noun phrase  . 
company name referred to comes at the end of tim sentence  , a way of emphasising the company name in Japanese . 
company name with to ( with ) , kara ( from ) , wotsuuji ( through ) , to no aidade ( between or among ) .

For doush a with ha ( Table 2) , compared with Table 1 , very l > w referents are located in the same sentence  , and most of the referents are in the subject position  . 
For both occurrences of dousha , a considerable number of the referellts appear two or more  sentelice8 beR ) re , and a few of them show up even two or three paragraphs before  . 
3 THREEHEURISTICMETHODS
TESTED 3 . 1 Three Heur i s t i c Methods Oile simple and two heuristiciile thods to fill  ( It herclLerents of dousha are described below . The lirst , the simple method , is to take the closest COml/any name ,   ( the one which appears most recently before dousha  )  , as its referent ( Siln I ) le Closest Method or SCM )  . 
It is used ill this paper to indicate the t ) ~ Lseline pcr-lbrmancet brreference resolution of dousha  . 
The second method is a modified Siml ) le Closest Method for dousha with ca . It is basically the same as SCM excep that : ? i f there is  ( tile or there , conlpany liaine hithesairies eiltellce before the dousha  , take . lie closest COllipally nanw . as the referent . 
? if there is a conip anyllaille inll nediately followed by ha  , ca , de ha , or niyorulo somewhere bel5 redous Da , use the closest such company name as the referent . 
? if the previous sentence nds with acOral ) anyll ; _~ llle , thus l ) utting aii enlp has is on the CO lll-pally liaine , make it ther cl\]2 relit . 
? if there is a pattern " CO lilpaily liamelie hllllialilial Iletitle  .   .   . "  ( equivalent to <' title hiilllaiilial no of cOUll  ) any elain e . . . " in I'\]nglish ) in the prove-OilsSOll tellce , then i is o the CO llipaliyn ~ iliie as tim refore lit  . Typical titles are sh . achou ( president ) alldkaichou ( Chair in an uPI/oard )  . 
The the Mheuristic method is used t~rdoush a with hacases  . It is also based on SCM except the following points : ? if there is a company name in nnediately tbL lowed by ha  , ga , de ha , or uiy or uto somewhere . 
before dousha , use the closest such colnl ) any name as the referent . 
* if the previous sentence nds with a company name  , thus putting an eniphasis Oil the coin-liany nalne  , make it there li'~rent . 
? if there is a pattern " coral ) any nanie no human name title . . . "  ( equivalent to " title human name of company name . . . " in English ) in the prove-milsseiltelice ~ the il/ise the cowilialiy Ilani eas there fi  ; rent . 
The third method is in fact a set of the second method  , and both of them use semantic information ( i . e . company name , human name . , title ), syntactic patterns ( i . e . where a conll ) any name , a human name , or a title appears in a sentence ) and several specific lexical items which come immediately after tim company Ilallies  . 
3.2 Test Results
The three l nethod shaw ' . heen tested on the develop-merit data from which the l nethods were produced and on the set  . of unseen test data . 
3 . 2 . 1Against the dew ; lolmient data As mentioned in section two , there are 42 cases of dousha with ga and 66 cases of dousha with ha . 
For the dousha with garases , the Simple Closest Method identifie . s the referents 67% correctly ( 27 correct out of 42 )  , and the secondine thod does so 90% ( 38 out of 42 ) correctly .   , qCM misses a number of referents wh Mi appear iii previou sentences  , and most of those which appear two or in or e sentelices previously  . 
For the cases of doush a with ha , SCM identities the referents correctly only 52% ( 34 correct out of 66 )  , however , the third heuristic method correctly ideiltilies 94%   ( 62 out of 66 )  . 
3.2.2 Against the test ; data
The test data was taken front Japanese newspaper articles on microelectronics  . There are 1078 arti--c . les , and 51 cases of dousha with ga and 250 cases of dousha with ha . The test has been conducted against the . all get cases ( 51 of them ) and the first tO0 Betcases . 
For the dousha with ga cases , the Simple Closest Method identifies the referents  80% correctly ( 4 I correct out of 51 )  , and the second method does so 96% ( 49 out of 51 ) correctly . 
For the c~Lses of dousha with ha , SCM identifies the referents correctly only 83% ( 83 correct out of 100 )  , however , tl , ethird heuristic method correctly ide . ntifies 96% (96 out of 100) . 
The following table , Table 3 , shows the summary of the test . results . 

Table 3 Summary of ' rest Results \ [ Development Data Test Dat_adousha with ga 
SCMI 67% 80% 2nd method I 90% 96% dousha with ha
SCM 52%   83  %  3rdmethod   94%   96%   4 DISCUSSION Tile second and third heuristic methods how high accuracy in finding the referents of dousha with ga and ha  . This means that partial semantic parsing ( in which key semantic information such as company name  , human name , and title is marked ) is snfli-cient for reference resolution of important referential expressions such as dousha in Japanese  . Moreover , since the two modified methods are simple , they will be easily implemented by computationally inexpensive finite-state pattern matchers  ( Hobbsela L 1992 ; Cowiectal .  1993) . Therefore , they will be suitable for largescale text processing  ( Jaeobs 1992 ; Chinchor el al .  1993) . 
One important point to realize is that the second and third methods  , although they are simple to implement , achieve something that is rather complicated and may be comput at lonally expensive otherwise  . For example , in order to find the correct referent of a given dousha  , you may have to skip one entire paragraph and find the referent wo paragraphs before  , or you may have to choose the right company name from several possible company names which appear before the given dousha  . The modified methods do this correctly most of the time without worrying about constructing sometimes complicated syntactic structures of the sentences in the search window for the possible referent  . 
Another important point is that the modified methods make good use of postnominal particles  , especially ha and ga . For example , if the referent is located two sentences or more before  , then the referent ( the company name ) comes with haah no stall the time ( 35 out of 38 such cases for both dousha )  . 
It seems that if tile referent of the doushain consideration is more than a certain distance before  , two sentences in this case , then tile referent is marked with hamost of the time  . Kitani also uses this haorga marked company names as key information ih is reference resolution algorithm for dousha  ( Kitani 1994 )  . 
5 CONCLUSION
The locations and contexts of tile referents of dousha in Japanese Joint-Venture articles are determined by hand  . Three henristic methods are proposed and tested . The methods which use semantic information in the text and its patterns how high accuracy in finding the referents  ( 9 6% for dousha with ga and 96% for doush a with ha for the unseen test data )  . The high success rates sngges that a semantic pattern-matching approach is not only a valid method but also an ef\[icicnt method for reference resolution in the newspaper article domains  . Since the Japanese language is highly case -inflected  , case ( particle ) infofmation is used effectively in these methods for reference resolution  . -How much one can do with semantic pattern matching for reference resolution of similar expressions such as " the company " or " tile Japanese company " in English newspaper articles is a topic for fllture research  .
