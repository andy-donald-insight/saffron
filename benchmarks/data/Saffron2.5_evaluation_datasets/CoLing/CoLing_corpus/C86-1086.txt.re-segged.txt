A new Theory of Names and Descriptions that offers a uniform treatment for many types of nonsingular concepts found in natural language discourse is presented  . We introduce a layered model of the language denotational base  ( the universe ) in which every world object Js assagned a layer ( level ) reflecting its relative singularity with respect tn other objects in the universe  , We define the notion of relative singularity of world objects as an abstraction class of the layer-membership relation  1  . Introduction Linguistic ( and related ) literature describes numerous forms of nonsingular concept ~ that can be found in discourse including intensional  ( or functional ) concepts , mass concepts , generic ( or general ) concepts attributive concepts , abstract concepts , etc . \[ I\],\[2\] .   13\]   \[4\]   16\]   \[10\] Not all of these approaches could properly capture the distinction between singular and nonsingular interpretation of linguistic descriptions  , and some were originally devised to deal with singular terms only  ( such as Donnellan's attributive interpretation of definite descriptions  \[2\]  )  . With the exception of intensional concepts , these notions have not been given satisfactory formal representations that would account for their role in natural language discourse  . Perhaps the most successful approach to non -singularity thus far has been presented by Montague  \[4\] with his formalised concept of intension . 
Unfortunately , the concept of intension does not capture all aspects of non-singularity and the rigid translation system into intensional logic  \[4\] seems to loose the smportant aspect of subjectivity in interpreting natural language discourse  . Also , the enormous complexity of any nontrwial system of possible worlds proved to be a bar in developing a computationally-oriented application of Montague's theory In this paper we introduce a fragment of a new  , and as we believe , computationally feasible Theory of Names and Descriptions that offers a uniform treatment for many types of nonsingular concepts found in natural language discourse  . Although we limit our presentation to nominal phrase constructions  , the approach can be further extended to cover other types of phrases  . In our theory we present the formalised definition of non-singularity with respect to a particular discourse situation involving a discourse message  , a number of individuals ( parties ) , and their knowledge , beliefs , awareness , etc , We introduce a layered model of reality ( the universe ) as perceived by a discourse participant , and define the notion of relative singularity of objects in this universe as an abstraction class of the layer-membership relation Subsequently  , linguistic descriptions and names are classified as singular  , measurably singular , or nonsingular depending on what they are assumed to denote in the universe The relationship between objects addressed in discourse and classified into different layers  ( levels ) of the universe has a particular significance for resolution of certain types of cohesive links in text  . We call these links remote references because they cross level boundaries  ,  2 . Non-singular terms in language Many philosophers and logicians  , see\[1\]-\[4\] ,  \[6\] ,  \[10\] . appreciate that the u~age of the underlined nominal phrases in the following sentences has a " general " or " generic " character  , except for " regular " singular interpretations which are possible only in some cases  . 
E ~ amplej ( ~, drh ~ wears a crown.
( lb)T ~ residentr selected every four years.
( lc ) Gold is a yellow metal ( ld ) The temperature is a measure of molecular motion . 
: One can imagine hundreds of similar examples involving such nonsingular objects as water  , beat , the Pope , the number etcUnfortunately , there is no commonly accepted account of these species in called them generic  , or general ( for example the king ) , or functional ( such as the number of students , ttretemperature ) uses of ( definite ) descriptions . Others , like Kripke\[3\] . were quite close to consider them names ( or at least some of them : heat gold )  . Yet others , see Quine\[6, 7\] . advocate the notion of abstract terms as being made of attributes  , such as/being \] red ( further abstracted as redness )  , or / being \] them and rinking tile martini ( which cannot be so easily uominalized ) which can predicate about " concrete " objects . 
There are numerous striking linguistic puzzles involving nonsingular definite descriptions see\ [ I\]  .  \[4\], \[5\] . The following example illustrates the phenomenon

Consider the following inferences : ( 2a ) The temperature is rising
The temperature is ninety.
so , Ninety is rising.
(2b ) The president met the Soviet leader many times
The president is Reaganso . Reaganmet the 5oviet leader many times ( 2c ) The tiger lives in the jungle . 
Mypet is a tiger.
so Mypet lives in the jungle
The conclusions in ( 2a ) to ( 2c ) are wrong in general case The explanation given by numerous researchers chiefly amounted to the corro-boration that the definite descriptions the temperature  , the president and the tiger in the first sentences of  ( 2a )  .   ( 2b ) and ( 2c ) respectively should be interpreted functionally , i . e . , as iutensions \[4\] , or functions over situations \[1\] Observe that if the descriptions were to be interpreted singularly or as enumerating all instances of a nonsingular object  ( i . e . , statements containing them were understood as making claims about each instance  )  , the reasoning would be sound . 
We claim that unless some two descriptions ( or names ) are used singularly or measurably singularly at the same level no simple  , eference can be made between them . In fact . another type of reference that we call remote reference can still take place and we shall put this view forward in this paper  3  . Tire Theory of Names and Descriptions Initially let us observe that our language deals with singular objects only  , no matter how complex their structure happens to be Suppose somebody is being put into posihon of the Observer whoperceives all these objects and has to use his language to describe them Some objects are sharply distinguished from others so he chooses to give them names as John  , Mary , Fatsy . Sun , . . The others have no clearly perceivable boundaries but he still may name them : tea  . water , grass , snow . . . . . and then refer to some measurable quantities of them as some tea  , littles now . etc , Yet others appear to be numerous , thoughenumerable , displaying strong similarities to one another . It would be pointless for Observer to give them each a name Instead  . he decides to refer to them as a cow , the man . 
this tree etcStill . he prefers to say the sun or the lake rather than to invent new names if he is not sure how many of them are there  , even if he is aware of just one specimen La Ler tie may find out that some objects were gwen identical names  , so having encountered them together he must refer to one as the John  . the Sun , or a Fatsy . 
Having completed his job Observer , who is also a part of this world , may name h~mself Observer or the Observer , and happilys it down under a tree on the grass Let us call the whole collection of objects he has just described as the Observer level and use the symbol L  0 for it Suppose then we ask Obser to tell us as much as he can about L  0 So on he finds out that his naming has its limits A she discovers new facts about his world it becomes more and more cumber some for him to communicate in terms of every man  . some cats . several trees , each president , etcHe discovers that somethings be originally considered distinct appear to be instances of some single object  . Also he must admit that the identity of some other objects has to be put into question Being smart enough  . Observer invents two new levels . L+1 and L_j . which augmen this world . At level L + I heplaces the new objects he discovered to be generalisations  ( or abstractions , if you like ) of some measurable amount of objects from L 0 which displayed a striking similarity or even identity  . From the perspective of L+l he isable to tell us that Ti retiger lives in the  . jungle . that The president is elected every four years , and that The Morning Star and The Evening Star are actually two appearances of tire plar ~ et Venus  . The objects at L+I are singular there , bnt they appear gen-eric " or " functional " or whatever of thaisor t as seen from L  0  . 
Observe that these objects may not have straightforward measurably singular descriptions at L  0   ( like every tiger , some president , etc ) . 
and often it will not be possible to refer to them in the terms of the language available at L  ( ~ . In either case one may expect that some undescribable aspect of an L+I object can emerge at Ln  . even if they all have been derived from L0 ( which does not have to be the case )  . 
Next Observer invents a new generation of names at L + l  . the president and the tiber may be among those names  . On the other hand Observer might prefer to use definite descriptions here  . for the similar reason he frequently decided so at L\[  )  . In fact . we have no means to distinguish between names and definite descriptions in discourse We  (  . an only stick to linguistic conveutions . 
It probably would not take a long time before a new augmentation for L +  ( becomes necessary . Two new levels L+1+1 and L+I_t carl be added in a much the same fashion The level L+~_  1does not necessarily have to be L0 although it probably will . More or less the same happens at the level / . _ 1 where Observer can now say that what he previously considered to be the atom actually denotes marry different kinds of atoms  ( H . OCa . Fe etc . ) , that tea is not so uniform and many different teas can be found  , and that under the name Joe Smith was actually hidden a group of crime story writers  . Subsequently the level L1 will expand by L_I + ( and L-a- ( with the former often different than L0 . Let us now formalize our intuition
Definition : 1
A use of a description will be called singular if it denotes or refers to a singular object  . A use of a description will be called measurably singular if it denotes or refers to some measurable quantity of a singular object  . Otherwise we shall talk of nonsingular use . 
Definition 2
A level will be an arbitrary collection of singular objects  . A level language will contain these and only singular and measurably singular uses of descriptions communicating of the level objects  . 
Definition 3
For any level L ~ . all names appearing in t be L , language have singular interpretations . 
Definition 4
For any level Ln there will be at least two distinct levels L~l and L  , +1 such that L , ,+l contains the nonsingular objects as seen from L  ,  . and L , -t contains the objects for which the objects at L  , are nonsingular
Definition 5
T be Observer level Lo is an arbitrary chosen level serving as a reference point Suppose that we have an object N called Nat level L  0  . Let T be an arbitrary set we shall refer to as a coordinate  . Suppose further that . for the coordinate T . the Observer discovers that the identity of N along that dimension can no longer be accepted  . That is . there are at least two x . yET such that Natx ~: Naty . Without losing generality we can assume that the coordinate T has been chosen so that the following non-equation holds : ? Vx  . y  ~ T . x~y ,   ( N  ~ )  ~ ( Ny ) Let ( Nx ) denote an object Nx for some xET . The Observer cannot ? place Nx's at L0 without violating definitions 2 and 3 Instead he moves them onto a new level L_Nt 7 leaving the original object Nat L0  . 
N may be no longer a " real " object but the concept remains in language LNt  7 can be attached to any existing level provided that the definitions  1 to 4 will never be violated It can also give a beginning to a new level  . Note that the distribution of N over the coordinate T forces ot be r objects from L  0 to be distributed over T as well . and their instances placed at LN_IT This process may remain mostly implicit until wemm  ( e an utterance relating ( Nx ) to other objects at LN_iT . 
In general we shall say that the level L_NiT is lower than the level L  0  , and write L~_lf < Lo Often we shall drop the superscripts N and T over the level symbol assuming some lower level L_~whenever it does riot lead to ambiguity Observe that with the above account the level structure of objects has a dynamic  , ever-changing character . Ally new empirical fact to be added to our world knowledge bears a potential reveberation in the level structure involving creation of new levels and moving objects between levels  . At probably nonfrequent idle states the definitions  1 to 4 assure the structure balance Moving at level L_ 1 the Observer is aware of an enumerable collection of different objects N  , 's Extending the description used for Nover N , 's the Observer refers to them as the N . aN . someN(s ) . 
every N . etc . It is possible , of course , that some other object N ' found at L 0 is now disclosed to be an Nx for some x ( ~ T . What that means is that we have wrongly placed N " at L  0  . because it actually belonged to L_l 13ut this was right at the time N " was placed there . 
i e . it mirrored tbestate of onr knowledge of the world at the time  . 
We may now give names to some Nx's and N can very well happen among them  . This time however N will not denote the old object from  L0: this will be actually quite a different name referring to one selected N  ,  . and which may be replaced by a definite description of  ( N  ~ ) On the other hand suppose wet lave some objects N l  , N2 , considered distim : tatL 0 Suppose then that we discover some resemblance between them along some dimension  ( coordinate ) T . so that we need a generalizing concept to talk about them  . We climb to some higher level L~I7- . i . eL0 < LNI7 . and establish a new object a super object N there No was seen from LN+jT all N/s are just the occurences of N at L  0 at different values of coordinate TIn other words  , the following equation holds : ? Vi Ix . x  ~ T ,   ( Nx ) = Ni Observe also that all Ni's now belong to the level NT  L+l--1 which is a part of LoAs before we shall drop superscripts N and T for simpli-city  . No matter how we name Nat L+I the following Formula of 
Discovery summarizes our action : ( FD)VxVy . x . yeT .   ( Nx )  = ( Ny ) Remember that the formula FD is valid only when observed from L+IAtL  0  . Ni's remain distinct traditionally-so they remain distinct in the language as well  . The generalisation of other objects from Loon to LN+\]T may follow but  . a sint be case of decomposition discussed above , the process will remain largely implicit . Once the super object N has been created it begins to live its own life  . Some new objects from L0 different than N/s . may now become instances of N at some not yet utilized values of coordinate T  . Also . we may use descriptions ( Nx ) without caring whether they actually refer to any objects at L  0  . The latter property of general terms which is widely discussed by Qnine  \[6   7\] gets a formal explanation in our theory . It is important not to confuse a super object with a set S of lower level instances over some coordinate Tas we would obtain a measurably singular concept only  . Instead . a super object can be identified with the function N from T into L  0such that whenevers ? S then there is a teT such that ( Nt ) = s . and then extended arbitrarily beyond the set S
Exam Die 3
We have the following distinct object at some level  L0: V called Venus . MS called Morning Star . and ES called Evening Star . Upon discovery that they all are just occnrences of the same planet we create a new object V " named Venus at some level LVl " T and such that for some  ; ~ . y . z ? T . where T is a time coordinate . 
( V '; ~) = V(V"v ) = MS . ( V'z ) = ES . According to the FD formula we conclude from L+1 that V = MS = ES . while the same conclusion made at Ln is false

At level Lothe OI ) server is aware of the object TP named The President  . Let T be the time coordinate ( different than in the last ? VxVy . x , yET ( TP x )  = ( TP y ) Later the Observer may dic over that for some tl . t2ET , ( TPtl ) = N and ( TP t2) = R , aud that at some level LT_~'T where N and R belong  , they are considered distinct and named Nixon and Reagan respectively  . But at Lo . R = N is true . The last observation can be made clearer if one imagines that TP is some abstract individual which  ( like Venus ) when observed in early 70's is named Nixon , while when observed in 80's is called Reagan ,  \[\]
Definition 6
An object Nata level L , is said to be remotely referenced if the reference comes from some level Lnj such that either L  , < L ~ or
L m < L ,
Typical cases of remote references in discourse have been listed in Example  2   4  . Super objects Let us now examine the nature of super objects i  . e . . the objects placed at level L+l . It turns out that the plural terms , e . g . 
presidents , tigers , etc . , are actually prototypes of superobJects , see\[6\] . and they should therefore be placed at the same level as respective super objects  . We will see that the generalization leads naturally to plural terms which may or may not induce equivalent singular super objects  . Conversely . a plural equivalen to a super object may suggest the most natural coordinate to decompose the latter onto some lower level  . When a super object lacks a plural equivalent , however , we may admit that this object's origin has been traced down  . A further decomposition is still possible but this process may often produce objects that will never assume an independent status and will remain recognized only as instances of-this general concepts cattered over that or another coordinate This phenomenon is characteristic of the socalled mass objects and their corresponding mass terms Quite naturally the question of - where one level ends and another begins arises The following example gives some insight into the problem of level boundaries  . 

Consider the following sentences.
( Sa ) Mary brings ( some ) water everyday.
Let water in ( 5a ) be the name of some super object wat the level L +I  . 
Presumably Mary brings only a part of w but we can say that w is being brought by Mary everyday This is the same we very day  , although each time possibly a different part of it is intransit  , which leads to the obvious translation ( at L+I )   ( i ) 5a-- ,   ( br-e-dMw ) where br-e-d stands for brings everyday . 
' On the other hand . suppose that Mary brings some water everyday . 
Except for the above interpretation , we also have the measurably singular reading at L0 where w is scattered over some coordinate T so that ~ tET such that  ( Wt ) is being brought by Mary . i . e . .
( ~ t ( brM(wt ))) . This clause is , of course , relative to everyday so at L0 we could have ( ii ) 5a - ~ ( Vx ( dx ) D ( ~\] t ( brM ( wt )   )   )   ) t where brines-~hr . day ~ d Both translations are essentially equivalent  , and this equivalence is by no means accidental . It lends a strong support for our Theory of Names and Descriptions  . and explains the intuition underlying its formulation  . 
5. Conclusion
In this paper we presented a new approach to representing various kinds of nonsingular concepts in natural language as the Theory of Names and Descriptions  . - I-hemaj or observation of the Theory is that reality  , as perceived by an intelligent individual , can be regarded as a partially ordered structure of levels such that each level contains only those objects which are considered relatively singular ObservetTo be precise we should represent Mary as  ( Ml ) here . i . e . . as an instance of the L 41 object M at some IET . However . our nanling convention discussed in section 3 allows for replacing lhede finite description by a new name at the level L  0  . We shall utilize this option here . 
3 64 that there are virtually no restrictions imposed upon the notion of relative singularity so that the distribution of objects between levels of the world model may differ among different individuals  . Non-singular objects , called super objects , are placed at a number of higher levels which are related to the current level with various coordinates Conversely  . a singular object may be decomposed along a coordinate  . 
and new objects , so obtained , will be placed at some lower level . This same coordinate can be used then to obtain instances of other objects at this lower level  , so that the relative singularity of objects within each level is maintained For more details concerning various aspects of tile theory the reader is referred to  \[8\] and\[g\]
