The elements of the stock of knowledge shared . by the speaker and the hearer change their sal - ience  , in the sense of being immediately accessible in the bearer's memory  . The hierarchy of salience is argued to be a basic component of a mechanism serving for the identification of reference  . Some of the regularities of this mechanism are discussed  , the description of which is a necessary prerequisite of an automatic understanding of connected texts  . 
i . When discussing the question of what is the main contribut-ion of computation all inguistics to theoretical linguistics at one of the panel discussions at Coling  80 in Tokyo , the pane lists unanimously pointed to the due emphasis laid on the function of natural language in communication  . In this direction , it is known from the classical Prague School that the topic/focus articulation belongs to the most important aspects connecting the structure of language with the conditions of its use  . However , this articulation I was not examined system at ically in most of the main linguistic trends  , so that the pioneers who are aware of its importance for natural language understanding  ( esp . Grosz ,  1977 , Reichman ,  1978 ,  1981 , McKeown ,  1979 , Hirst , 1981) attempt to find their own ways . 
During the discourse the stock of " knowledge " the speaker assumes to share with the hearer changes according to what is " in the centre of attention " at the given time point  .   2 Each utterance has its influence on this h ierarchy of salience  ; however , not every mention-ing of an object has the same effect  . The assumption that the degrees of salience constitute a partial ordering is corroborate de  . g . by the degrees of consciousness characterized by Chafe  ( 1974 )  . 
Let us denote by x ~ an expression x referring to an object a that is salient to the-qa- degreen in the stock  ; since the maximum of salience can more easily than other degrees be imagined to be fix-ed  , we denote it by ~= ~ , reversing the direction of " growth " of the degrees  ; to the left ( right ) of the arrow we indicate the state immediately preceding  ( following ) the utterance of a sentence S in which x occurs ; xcF ( T ) stands for " x belongs to the focus ( ~ opic ) of S " ; --P ( x ) denotes that x is expressed either by a weak pronoun or Tsd~le~ed in S  , though -- present in its tectogrammatical represent ~ ation  ( TR )  ; 3 with--NP .  _ ( x ) we refer to definite NP's and to such _--~ a ~ e a NP's as one of the N  , ~ o ~( of the ) N . 
According to a preliminary empirical invest igation it appears that : the following rules concerning the degrees of salience obtain  ( cf . a first formulation of some of them in Sgall , 1980a , p . 240) , where m , n > ~ : ( i ) If P ( X_a ) , then a_n-+a_n-(2) If NP(x a ) C\[ , then a_n-?a ~ (3) If NP def(~a ) C ~ , then a_n--+1 (4) If a_n--+a_m- , then b_ m-+2 obtains for every object b that is not itself referred to in the TR of S  , but is immediately associated with it ( as e . g . teacher or pupil are with school , or parents with child , e--t-~ . .) (5) If As for xa , or C0 noern in ~ xa is present in S , then a ~+ aI ~ ( 6 ) If ~ a is not included in the TR of S , not even among the associated objects ( see Rule ( 4 ) ) , then a ~+ an-+2As was pointed out by Sgall ( 1967 a , p . 95 f . ; 198 Ob) , the differ-ence between n = ~ and n = 1 is too small to make the reference assignment un\[vocal<if--such specific pronouns as Czechten  , German der or Engl . the latter are not present ) : If Charlesmet PAU Lisf-o\[lowed by Hewore his HAT  , we may only guess whether he refers to Paul and histoCharles  , or vice w ~ rsa , or whether a third possibili-ty is present  . However , whenever the difference in the degrees of sal -ience is greater  , an occurrence of a pronoun or of a definite NP in the next utterance regularly refers-as we want to illustrate in the sequel-to that object which was referred to as the most sal ient among those that meet the lexical and grammatical conditions of the NP or pronoun < number  , gender ) . The two main types of the thematic progressions described by Dane ~  ( 1968 ; 1976) are important here . Also Hobbs ( 1976 ) specifies a common heuristics for resolv ing pronouns  , which says that we should prefer the subject to an NP in the object position  ( in other words , since the subject position in English funct ions as a rule as  ( a part of ) the topic of the sentence , this heuristics says that the tJpic is pre ferably preserved in successive sentences  )  . Another possible strategy < Hobbs ,  1979 ) includes infer-encing and factual knowledge . 
In our rules some of the relationships between the salience and the pragmatic relations h ips of lexical units are treated only in a prel iminary way  . Thuse . g . Rule ( 4 ) or a similar rule should reflect also a rather common situation when a mentioning of a part icular object  ( or objects ) brings into foreground only a fraction of a set of objects that already are in the for e ~ round of the stock of knowledge  . It does not capture the case when the foregrounded object  ( s ) belong to a set the activation of which has al readyfaded away under the threshold of activat ion  ; it seems to be a plausible hypothesis that even in such a case the " rest " of the objects are being activat-ed beyond this threshol ~ by mentioning the foregrounded object  ( s )   , even if to a very low extent . 
2 . Let us illustrate the above rules on af ragment of text  ; we are not concerned with a systematic l inguistic analysis of the given text here  , but we coB centrate on the changes of activation of the elements of the stock of shared knowledge as reflected  ( and induced 3 by the discourse . We restrict ourselves to objects ident if ied by NP's or pronouns and we leave a side act ions and their circumstantial ONTHEROLEOF HIERARCHYOFACTIVATION  109 qualifications . The capital letters denote the intonation centre of each clause  ; for the ease of reference , the clauses are numbered . 
A partial preliminary discussion of such a text was presented in Ha-ji ~ ov ~ and Vrbov ~  ( 1982 )  .

The following comments are numbered according to the number of the clause to which they refer  . We omit those clauses the commentary to which follows trivially from the previous comments and from the rules  . 
\[ I\]In the opening sentence of the text two objects are introduced : the school garden and the children  . Since the latter object is ment-ioned in the focus of the sentence  , it becomes more salient than objects mentioned previously or those activated by their presence in the broader context or situation  . Also the associated objects such as school , pupils , and teachers are now relatively salient . 
\ [2a \] The children as a highly salient object in the stock of shared knowledge are referred to in the topic position by a pronoun  , which keeps their activation at the same degree  ( see Rule El ) ) , while the activation of the other objects < Rule  ( 6 ) ) fades away . 
\ [2b \] A new object enters the scene : the teachers . However , their appearance on the scene is not completely new and surprising  , because the hearer has already been introduced into the scene of school  , which has the teachers associated with it ( see Rule < 4 ) ) . This is why the teachers can be understood as re ferring to the teachers of the children and the school which were already mentioned  . In accord-ONTHEROLE OF HIER ARCHY OF ACTIVATION 111 ance with Rule ( 3 ) the degree of salience of teachers is I . The children remain on the scene-they are reminded by a pronominal reference in the topic and their activation does not fade a way  ( see Rule < i ) ) . It should be noted that even though the pronoun them is in the final position of the sentence  , it is preceded by the intonation centre ; it is wellknown that all participants placed after the inton-ation centre belong to the topic part of the sentence  . 
\ [2c \] The pronoun in the topic has an indistinct reference : both teachers and children may be referred to  . This in distinctness of reference is diffi cult to solve : according to the strategies mentioned in Sect  . 
2 the two objects are sal ient enough to be referred to by a weak pronoun  , and the teachers as well as the children can be excited in the given situation  , so that not even factual knowledge with inferenc ing gives a safe clue  . The formulation of the text can be character i zed as not successful in this point  . However , if the lexical setting of \[2c\]were changed , as in \[2c~\] and\[2c''\] , the indistinctness would disappear , and only one of the two possible candidates of reference would be chosen  , namely the teachers in \[2c '\] and the children \[2c  ''\]:  \[2c  '\]  .   .   . because they were always kind to their pupils . 
\[2c''\] . .  . because they were too small to understand theser iousness  ,   .   . 
\ [3\] A new object is being introduced in the focus of the sentence  ; a-gain , it can be said that it is not completely new , because it is also given by the broader scene < of family relations : children-parents  )  . 
This newly introduced item receives a very high degree of activation  , while the other two objects - the children and the teachers-are not mentioned in this sentence at all and thus their activation fades away  ( see Rule < 6 ) ) . 
\ [4\] The speaker chooses a subset of the most act ivated set of elements and speaks about this subset  ; he introduces a new object on the scene , which receives a high degree of activation ( see Rule < 2 ) ) , but since it does not appear in any of the fol lowing utterances  , this activat-ion later fades a way step by step < Rule  ( 6 ) > . The complement to the set of five parents - the rest of the pa~ents-retains the degree of a rather high activation  , see Rule (3) . 
\ [6\] One of the items the activation of which has been fading away < the teachers  ) is back on the scene ; the teachers may be referred to by a definite NP in the topic since the activation has not been lowered under a certain threshold  , which would otherwise lead to an explicit re introduction  . 
\ [~9\] An explicit reintroduction of the chi l dren is preferred by the speaker since the chi ldren have not been mentioned in several preceding utterances  ; their activation has been lowered considerably . For such strong re-activation expressions such as concern in @  , as far as . . . is concerned , as for . . . are used . 
\ [I0\] Only one subset of the children is explicit ly mentioned in this sentence  ; the activation of this item of knowledge is ra ised < Rule  <3  ) ) , but also the complement subset of pupils is " supported " in its activation < Rule < i  ) ) , which does not fade a way as it would be the case if no pup ils were menuioned at all < Rule  <6  ) ) . 
\[ llb\]The reference of the pronoun ~ is again in distinct  ; it may refer either to the smallest or to the tall pupils  . Neither of the strategies mentioned above helps : both the NPs the tall < pupils  ) and the smallest < pupils ) are in the topic position of \[ lla\] , and both are activated to the same extent : the smallest pupils were referred to in \[ lla\] by pronoun them and the activation ' of this i tem was preserved < Rule  ( I ) )  ; the tall were mentioned by a definite NP in the topic  , which keeps their activation . This in distinctness remains 112E . HAJI~OV ~, and S . VRBOV . ~ unsolved even after the utterance of\[12a\] , which adds another in distinct reference < their teachers - whose ? of the smallest ? of the tall ?  ) and it is only after hearing \[12b \] that the hearer can decide : there the explic it mentioning of the teachers of the smallch ildren resolves the indistinct reference of their in  \[12a \] and at the same time our factual knowledge of the world invites the inference that if the small children pretended not to be interested  , their teachers would have nothing to be proud of  , so that they in \[ llb\]can refer only to the tall pupils  . 
\ [16\] The speaker of the direct speech is notment ioned in the quote  ( only by means of his reference to the Society of Friends of the School  , of which he undoubtedly is a member ) , but the activation of this item does not seem to fade a way  . This appears to be a general feature of direct speech  , which follows from the semantico-syntactic structure of the direct speech  , where the " direct speech clause " functions as an object  ( Patient ) of the introductory clause ( and the speaker , as the Actor of the sentence , belongs to the TR of the same sentence ) . 
\ [27\] The use of the courageous child to refer to the small pupil who screamed " Hurrah !" offers another example of the inferencing the hear-er must perform in order to understand what is the sentence about and to determine the reference  , even in cases where full NP's rather than pronouns are used  . 
It is also easy to verify that with other var iants of the text the weak pronoun they  , if it were used after each of the sentences \[5\] ( e . g . in 6": The children observed them, . . . ),\[6\],\[13\],\[18\], etc . , would lack any re ferent ia l ind ist inctness ; similarly for heafter\[14\]< where , in fact , the pronoun is deleted ) ,  \ [17\ ]  ,  \[22\] , etc . 
The referential in distinctness is present ( and must be solved by means of inferencing ) after such utterances as e . g . \[2b\] ,  \[9\] , \[ IO\] , \[ lla\] , \[12a\] , where objects with the degrees @ and 1 can be referred to by the same pronoun . In a similar wav the indistinctness of the reference of nouns can be studied  , cf , e . g . the use of father in \[19\] ( synonymous with he , while in \[20\] the pronoun and in \[27\] the noun is necessary )   . 
3 . To conclude , it should be noted that when speaking about the h ierarchy of salience  ( activation ) and of degrees of activation of items of the stock of shared knowledge we do not have in mind an absolute scale or linear ordering of elements  . The raise or drop of activation should be a l ways taken as related to the other items of the stock  . In the rules , we use two kinds of raise : a mild one < Rule < 3 ) ) , and a strong one < Rule(2)) ; it may be the case that further empirical research will lead us to a more subtle class i fication  . 
Also , we are aware that this is a point where linguist ic and psychol-ogical investigations should go hand in hand  . Anyhow , we are cnn vinc-ed that such an empirical research  , if guided by an attempt at a more explicit and systematic description  , is of primary importance for ( automatic ) language comprehension , and as such also for all applicat-ional pro jects of text understanding  .

2 The term " giveness " is often used in a s imi larsense  , but it should be born in mind that a " given " i temmay be in contrast  , or ir-recoverable ( in the terms of Halliday ) , or not identifiable ( Chafe ) , so that a definite noun may well occur inside the focus of a sentence  .
