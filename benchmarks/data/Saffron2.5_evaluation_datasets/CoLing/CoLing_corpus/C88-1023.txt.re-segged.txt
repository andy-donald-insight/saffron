In this paper mi if hzation and transductien moch a ni ~ m  . % are applied in a new approach too hono\] . ogical parching . It is shown that unification in the sense of Kay as used in unification grammars  , and tlm ~ . sda , : t\[o a , ap~o ~; ess deriving from automata theory , ~~-~ both valuable tools for use in computational pb  ,  . m, . , k~gy . By way of illustration , a brief outline of the allophs ni . c parser described by Church is given .

A fundament ald b % inction is made between two domains : the  . 
representations at the phonetic and phonological levels  , and the proc ~ . ssing of these representations . 
On this basis , ad\[~itinct is nismade between networks of tran ~ . di + ction relations < e . g . between all ophones and phonemes ), and a . % et of possible processors ( i . e . 
parsers and transducers ) for the interpretation of such networks . 
1 . ' F~e~ne~du ~ tion and Unification in Phono logy The proposal to use finlte-state transducers in morphology and phonology has been advocated in recent years by Kaplan and Kay  /1981/  , Koskenniemi / 1983/and others , It has been suggested/Gibbon 1987! that finlte-state transducers are the most appropriate devices for use in other areas of computational phonology  . In Koskennlemi's system , single finite--state transducers act as parallel fllters in the analysis of Finnish morphology  . However , in his morphophs no logical analysis Koskenn leml has been critlcised for uslngmon adlc segments rather than the feature bundles which play such an important role in phonology/Gazdar  1985:601/  . In the proposal present cxl below , segments regarded as feature bundle ~ are essential components in the model  . The ques Lionas to whether it is better to represent the phonological rules as a cascade of transducers or to incorporate them into a single transducer will not be considered here  . Kaplan and Kay /1981/ have already put fow ar'da method of compiling the series uf transducers into a sing\]  . (-: transducer ( described by Kay/1982/)) , Below , for discussion purposes , a single transducer is assumed . 
Furthermore 1 would llke to stress that on the phonological level I will discuss network \[' e presentahions of phonotactic and allophonic cons'tralnts  . The transitions in these networks consist of transduction relations  . In the proce . ~s domain a finite-state transducer will be used to interpret the networks  . This is a distinction which is not always made but is beneficial for abstracting the attributes of the model from the processing of the model  . Below more emphasis will be placed on the representation domain as it is this whlch is most interesting for " discussion purposes  . The actual implementation of the processing domain as a program is regarded  , theoretically , as a secondary but by nom ~ nsamin or issue . 
Unification is a concept which has become common in linguistics in recent years due to the important role it plays in current syntactic theories such as FUG  , LFG and GPSG . However , it has not as yet played an explicit part in phonological analysis  . Below I propose that , by employing elementary unification mechanisms , assimilation and dis~imllation can be dea\] . hwlthin a most satisfactory way . The unification used in this connection is based on the functional description unification described by Kay 

Here I will give an informal definition of unification based on contradiction and set union and in terms of feature bundles  , since this is the representation which will be used below  . Two feature . 
bundles composed of attribute-value pairs may be said to unify if for each attribute in their union there does not exist an attribute of the same name with a in place of a value in ~ I~e featn rebundle ~ this variable wilt be  . assigned permanently the va\] . ue from the corresponding attribute--value pai r in then the r bundle if this exists  . This definition of unificati . en , and its implements lion , differs from Prologter munification .

When this phonotactic net is interpreted by a particular parser the phonetic input is generally a stringeffu\]ly specifl ~ xl feature bundles * ~ nd in order to u ' ~ e the output for recognition purposes the phonemic output will also be fully specified  . Iti . % here that unification plays an important role . 
indeed the features themselves may not be recosnisable  . This facility is advantageous for work in ~ with feature detectors at the frontend as it is still possible to analyse what is known  . Thls , of course , leads to underspecifk ~ l output which may be used in connection with a lexicon for recolnltlon hypothesis in  5   . In such cases the underspecified output , althoush represent in ~ classes of phonemes in the various positions  , will only allow those combinations of such classes which actually exist  , thus llmltJng'possibilities available for hypothesis  . 
Thus it is not necessary to check the lexicon for forms which accord ln  5 to the rules of the language cannot exist .

Tran~it\[unacceptln~voicelessospirated ploslvos ~  ; hen attempt in 5 to traverse the network the fully specified input feature bundle must unify with the input transition speel fl cat lon  ( in terms of C-features ) of the current transition . If unification succeeds , the fully specific4 output bundle must contain the output transition specifications together with all those features from the fully specified input bundle not contained in the input transition specification  . In set the \[~ retic terms , let us call the fully specified input feature bundleln FB  , the input and output transition specifications ITS and OTS respectively  ; if unification of InFB with ITS succeeds , the fully specified output bundle OutFB is OTS ~ ( In FB/ITS )  . 
The phonetic input feature bundles may be also underspecified however  . This allows for circumstances where the values of some features may not be know nor  4  . Gonstr ' ain in ~ Principles Church discusses a number of factors  , most of which date back to work by Morris Halle and are discussed by Chomsky and Halle  /1960/  , which must be taken into consideration when desl6ning the model I1983:1281 length , idiosyncratic systematic gaps , voicing assimilation , place assimi \] . a tien and dissimilation , sonority . These can all be incorporated very easily into the network  . The fact that languages restrict sound combinations  ( Jdiosyncratl cgaps ) and the length of in it lal/flnal consonant clusters is in any case the basis on which this network is constructed  . Decreasing sonority from the nucleus of the syllable towards the margins would seem to be a matter of having\[son \] as a C-feature and adjusting the value at the appropriate transition  . 
With re~ard to phonotactic constraints , the C-.
features on the transition labels may have variable values  . In other words we may cater for the fact that all initial/s/in Bn~lish may not be followed by voiced plosives by havin  5 as input specifications for one of its follow ln ~ transitions the C-features\[-voc\]  , \[~ cent\] , \[~ voice\] , \[ oson \] , \[- strid \]) ( see Fig . 2) . ~ here must have the same value in the three cases  , this value be in ~ assigned durin ~ unification . 
Unification would fall in this case for voiced plosives as they would be specified for the feature ~\[- reel  , \[- cont\] , \[+ voice\] , \[-son\] , \[- strld\] . A further convention is Introduced , * tamely that once a feature has been specified on a particular transition it remains until it is eKplicitly altered  , ella subsequent transition . In this way vowel harmony may be incorporated into such a network whereby the vowel s Deeifi cat lons would remain for subsequent transitions since they would not be relevant for interven in ~ consonants  .

(1  ; I and / ~/ ~ tv ( ~ abbrevl ~ ltlrm ~ ; ftlrfully specified fetl tuiebund I ~ t  ;   ) Its hoal ( l be clear also that feature bundle representation together with unification is an elegant way of dealing with assimilation  , dissimilation and neutrall sation . Assimilation and dissimilation are dealt with by Chomsky and laile  /1968/ in terms of variables a . ~\] feature cfK ~ . fficients and it is this , method which has been incorporated into the network here  . So for example , in eases of voice assimilation , the fe/Iture\[voice\]may be checked using a variable  , say\[avolc ~\] . Therefore , where the particular input segment ha ~ the feature\[+voice\]  , unification assigns the value + to the undef in ? Rl variable ? ~ permanently  , and slmila Fly in the case of a negative value . This newly found value together with the attribute will then be a  ( k-feature in the input specification for the following I ransltion unless exp\]icltly changed on that transition  . This is a type of feature-pass lng technique : ~ imilar to that employed in unification-based syn 'i  ; actlc theories , but essentially simpler , slnce it is nsn-recurslve . 
Transltion weighting is also very important in this model  , St\]kirk /1980/ emphasil ~ es that it is all very well to cater for collocational restrictions but other constraining principles such as maxl mising snoots should also  ) be incorporated into a syllable parser . 
Thusironed \] ions are weighted in such a way that the most preferred path out of the network is sought  . 
' Early closure '/ Kimball 1973/: for example , which seeks the shorte ~ ; t path out of the network , is equivalent to the maxima \ [ onset principle . Str~s re ~ yllablfl cat lon is simllar \] y dealt with using weighting  . Thus , such constraints are incorporated into the network in a simple and principled fash it m  . 
5. Gyllable Parsing
Up to now we have \] men discussing the representation level  , namely the phons\]atticnet envisaged as a syllable template  . The phonotac U . cnet in hhls case was for English but it should be  . clear that this representation may he used for other languages  , dialects sr codes . Since the phenol ~ cticnet is a network of transduction relations between all ophone and phoneme it should be both a peech analysia and synthesis  . 
to note at this stage however , that level we are not re ' ~ ; tricte ~ to what we employ . The phonotactic netmay a usefu\[tool for

In the mode \] , deacrib ( Mhere the aim wa ~ to use the simplest formalism pcJssible  . Thus the parsing and translation processes are undertaken by a dept l > first nondeterministi  . c finite state transducer . That is to say , the phonotac Ucnets of ti-ans ducti ~ nre\[a titms are interpreted by a fin~te  , -state machine . Giwm the phonetic input in the form of feature bundles  , the tram~ducerms ve ~; from , ,~ tate to s ta te in l ine ~ i th the un i f i ca tion procedure de ~  ; crilx Mins6x:tion'3 above .

Therefore , in order to find more than one syllable the transducer iterates so that phonological units and syllable boundaries are output unt il the input  , q tring is empty . Thu ~; we have a single iterative finite . % Late precooks . The parsing and canonicalisation pt-t~:e . ~ses referred to inf ; ection 2abtweare in ( : or porated into a single proceduJe . 
% that is interesting to note in this esnnection is l that since the l ~ I rsing proc +  . ~ turei . ~ ; u on determini ~4 tic in fact all " p ( easible " syllables from the beginning of the input are checked internally  ( i . e . in the intermediates tag ~ before producing , mtput ) . Thu . ~s the notionella " pov~slble ~ syllable of English is catered fol  . 
From a psychological viewpoint it is an intere ~ting fact that only the " possible " syl\]abh  . , saye considered . 
This would also betile case in human protest , to g If fneologisms where by no attempt would be made to form a syllable with an \[ mpc~sib\]  . einlt Jal/flnal consonant cluster comb\]no\]los : humans can accept wwds which conform to the rules of their language even if the words do not actually exist  . Thus , with thi:3 meg/el we can distlngnish Imtween " possible " and " acttlal " words  . 
If we tested Currol\]'s Jabber wocky using this model we would get a correct syllable structure  . As already noted , the lexictm filters out actual words . 
\]096. Conclusion
The implementation of this model doe+s not claim to be a speech recognition system as it stands but :\[  , sfat . her an attempt to deal with a small component of such in a new  , elegant and theorectically satisfy tnSway . Hnlfication and transduction can be seen to be usefulm ? ~ hanisms in syllable parsing  . Unification prey\[desueder speclficahion -manl pulation and feature-pan  , sing facilities and transduction provides a translation facility between allophsnes and phonemes  . 
Tvansduction relations interpreted by a flnlte -state transduce /" have the further advantage cf bidir'ectlonalty  . That is to say , one can translate \[\ [ omallophones to phonemes OYvice versa  ( perhaps with some ambiguity in the phoneme -allophoned tre ~ tion  )  . This system , however , should be a useful tool\[n both speech synthesis and speech analysis  . 
An exten & ; ~ ou of this notion of a syllable parser is t ( : ) tale interats of phonological words , whereby at the ( epre_ . sentation level the network would ?: on sist of two . 
sub-nets catering for redu?:ed and unreduced syllables I ' espectively  . A furthei extension is to use a tree-structured lexicon could be employed in a similar way to that propor ~ e  ( l by Kay /\]9821 to distin ~ ulsh actual words from pc ~ . J slble words . Representing the lexicon as a diserlmination net and in terms of distinctive feature bundles makes it possible to deal with variol \] s  ) arts of a recognition system in a uniform way . The movement of the transduce i ' may then be directed by us in ~' the tree-lexicon in paraliel  ( see Flg . 3> . In .
