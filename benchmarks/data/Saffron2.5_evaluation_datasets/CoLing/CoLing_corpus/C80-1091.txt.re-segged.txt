A MATHE MATICAL MODEL OF THE VOCABUL ARY-TEXT RELATION 

Tartu , Estonia , USSR
A new method for calculating vo-
cabulary size as a function of text
length is discussed . The vocabulary
grow this treated as a probabilistic
process governed by the principle of
" the restriction of variety " of lex-
ics . Proceeding from the basic model
of the vocabulary-text relation a
formula with good descriptive power
is constructed . The statistical fit
and the possibilities of extrapola-
tion beyond the limits of observable
data are illustrated on the material
of several languages belonging to dif-
ferent typological groups.
by deducing the relation between V and
N from some other important quantita-
tive characteristics of text such as
Zipf's law and Yule's distribution
( Kalinin , Orlov ) 3. The author under-
lines the importance of these concep-
tions for the theory of quantitative
linguistics on the whole , but points
out their insufficiency in solving
some practical linguo-statistical
problems where greater exactness and
reliability are needed ( style-statis-
tical analysis , text attribution , ex-
trapolation beyond the limits of ob-
servable data , etc.).
i . There are a great number of at-
tempts to construct an appropriate
mathematical model which would ex-
press the dependence of the size of
the size of vocabulary ( V ) on the size
of text ( N ). This is not only of
practical importance for the resolu-
tion of a series of problems in the
automatic processing of texts , but it
is also connected with the theoreti-
calexplanation of some important as -
pects of text generation . In practice
one often makes use of various empir-
ical formulae which describe the
growth of vocabulary with sufficient
precision in the case of concrete
texts and languages l , though such for-
mulae do not have any general sign if -
icance . Of special interest are some
" complex " models derived from the o-
retical considerations , e.g ., by bas-
in gone * s considerations on the hypo-
thesis about the lognormal distribu-
tion of words in a text ( Carroll ) 2 or
2. Instead of the " complex " mode/s
a " direct " method is proposed where
the relation between V and N is re-
garded as the primary component with
its own immanent properties in the
statistical organization of text . The
relation between V and N has to be
analyze dua the background of some es-
sential inner factors of text genera-
tion . The dynamics of vocabulary
grow this considered as the result of
the interaction of several linguistic
and extra , linguistic factors which in
an integral way are governed by the
principle of " the restriction of va-
riety " of lexics ( an analogue of the
principle of the decrease of entropy
in self-regulating systems ). The con-
cept of the variety of lexics is de-
fined as the relation between the size
of vocabulary and the size of text in
the form of V/N ( type-token ratio , or
coefficient of variety ) or N/V ( aver-
age frequency of word occurrences).

The coefficient of variety is sup-
posed to be correlated with the prob-
abilistic process of choosing " new "
( unused ) and " old " ( already used in
the text ) words at each stage of text
generation . The steady decrease of the
degree of variety V/N = p is attended
by the increase of its counterpart :
( N-V)/N-I-V/N = q(p,q-1),
which can be interpreted as the " pres-
sure of recurrency " of words in real
texts ( analogous to the concept of re-
dundancy in the theory of informa-
tion):
~ I
N-V
3. The formulae of the relation between
V and N are constructed from the basic
models : V = Np or V = N(1-q).
For this purpose the quantitative
changes of V/N = p depending on the
size of text are analyzed . According
to the initial hypothesis the rela-
tion between V/N and N is approxi-
mated by the power function of the
type:V/N = aNB(a and B are con-
stants ; B < O ), which leads to the
wellknown formula of G . Herdan@:
V = aNb ( where b = B+1). A verifi-
cation shows good agreement with em-
pirical data in the initial stages
of text formation ( in the limits of
about ~, OOr ~-5, 000 tokens which cor-
respond to a short communication).
Later on the rate of the diminishing
of the degree of variety ( V/N ) grad-
ually slows down ( due to the rise of
new themes in the course of text gen-
eration ). Accordingly the initial
formula has to be modified and this
can be done by logarithmization of
the variables . The first attempt gives
us in ( V/N ) = aNB , which leads to
some variants of the Weibull distri-
bution . This kind of distribution
shows good agreement with the empir-
ical data within the boundaries of a
text of medium length , but it is not
good for extrapolation . Only after
balancing the initial formula by the
logarithmization of both variables we
obtain in ( V/N ) = a(lnN ) B and the
corresponding formula for expressing
the relation between V and N :
V = Ne-a(lnN)B
or V = NI-a(lnN)b(where b =
= B-l)p , which turns out to be the
most adequate formula for solving our
problems . The constants a and B
( which , of course , are not identical
with those of the previously mention -
ed formulae ) may be determined on the
basis of linearization : lnln(N/V ) =
= A + Bluln N , where A = In a , using
the method of least squares . In prin-
ciple it would be sufficient to have
two empirical points for the calcula-
tion of the values of the constants
but for greater reliability more
points are needed.
4. The good descriptive power of
the given function and the possibill-

ties of extrapolation in both direc-
tions ( from the beginning up to a text
of about N = lO7) has been verified on
the basis of experimental material
taken from several languages belonging
to different typological groups ( Esto-
nian , Kazakh , Latvian , Russian , Po-
lish , Czech , Rumanian , English ). The
function may be applied to the analy-
s is of individual texts as well as
composite homogeneous ( similar ) texts
and the size of vocabulary ( V ) may be
determined by counting either word
forms of lexemes . ( See Tables 1 and 2.)
This seems to corroborate the assump-
tion about the existence of a univer-
sallaw ( presumably of phylogenetic
origin ) which governs the process of
text formation on the quantitative
