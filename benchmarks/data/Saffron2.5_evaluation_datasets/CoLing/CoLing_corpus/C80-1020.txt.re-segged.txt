The present study deals with conflict resolution process in metaphorical interpretation for the noun phrase  . In order to make the problemm bre explicit , we have reviewed the knowledge representation with conflict both from cognitive psychology and artificial intelligence  . Then , we propose a semantic model which is obtained from the notion of Linguistics as Chemistry  . That is , the model called " Semistry " is introduced so as to interprete a metaphor semantic bonds between nouns  . By using production system couped with contex free parser  ( ELINGOL )  , the working system called META-SIM is constructed to analyze the noun phrase metaphor  . 
Finally , there are discussions on a role of metaphor in human cognitive processing  . 
I . Introduction
A conflict resolution in semantic analysis is regarded as an important problem in natural language processing  . In case of a human cognitive system , this kind of problem was discussed in the realm of behavioral decision making theories  , such as Festinger's ( 1957 ) theory of cognitive dissonance and Abels on's ( 1968 ) Psychological implication . And also , it was discussed in the field of cognitive psychology which dealt with the human information processing mechanism  , especially long term memory ( LTM ) representation . 
The work of Kintsch ( 1969 ) in his structure of semantic memory was useful for insight into the conflict resolution in lexical item stored in LTM  . He particularly made his attention on the problems on how one semantically unacceptable a sentence  . 
If one selects the problem from artificial intelligence field  , McDermott's ( 1974 ) TOPLE in " Ring formal is m " was suggestive to a design of inference mechanism which could interprete unacceptable knowledge in a simple world model  . 
This formarism also guided us about a construction of lexical data in natural language processing  . 
By following these current issures on knowledge representation  , the present study focuses the problem of conflict resolution in semantic analysis of Metaphor both from viewpoints of cognitive psychology and artificial intelligence  . For this purposes , we propose a new semantic model which can deal with the metaphorical interpretation together with the inference mechanism  . And then , we will demonstrate examples of metaphorical analysis which is based on the proposed semantic model  . 
2 . Semantic representation with conflict knowled ~ Metaphor plays an important role in our understanding of language and of the world we describe through language  . Thus , there have been a number of researches on the nature of metaphor since the time of Aristotle  . 
Recently , historical survey on metaphor was made by Ortony , Reynolds & Alter ( 1978 ) on their paper titled " Metaphor : Theoretical and Empirical Research "  . Their main concerns on metaphor are to develop a model of metaphoric comprehension both from Psychological reaction time study and " Schema " based theoretical framework  . To quote their paper : " The structure of a shema is of a series of variables together with relationships among them  . There are constraints on the values that the variables may take  , but these constraints are rarely absolute , although some values are typical than others . This kind of representation system appears to offer greater flexibility for matching incoming information to previously stored knowledge  , and with this flexibility comes a better prospect for dealing with nonliteral use of language  . The metaphorical interpretation would be achieved by finding that schema or those schemata that matched the input in such a way as to minimize the required changes in variable range  . " Certainly , the idea of schema described above is one of convergences on the knowledge representations proposed by Rumelhart & Ortony  ( 1977 ) and Bobrow & Norman ( 1975 )  . Here , the procedure for the metaphorical interpretation is a kind of pattern-matching process which is based on a semantically acceptable interpretation  . In order to make a discussion more explicit , let us consider the same type of problem which deals with knowledge a quisition through the conflict or contradict resolution  . 
For this purpose , we focus our attention to the semantic structure which is stored in an understanding system  . 
In case of Kintsch model , this problem is to define a lexical entry used in the semantic memory  . And further , the notion of acceptability of sentence is defined by the use of production rules which are applied to the set of propositions stored in memory system  . 
If there exists a production rule for a set of acceptable  . And if not , the sentence is semantically unacceptable . Therefore , if two sentences are contradictory , the memory system must decide which one to keep and which one tO disregard by choosing the one with acceptability  . In case of McDermot's TOPLE , this kind of contradiction is resolve through the notion of " ring " which can absorb the confliction  . This process is accomplished through a procedure called DOUBT  . By this procedure , the system can find the allowable course of action to take to patch uparing  . 
In this connection , Tanaka (1980) in his SRL , this procedure is carried out through the use of production rule called " without description "  . In SRL representation which is an extension of Bobrow & Winograd's KRL  , knowledge is organized around conceptual entities with associated descriptions and procedures  . Therefore , by embedding various procedures to knowledge , lexical item is represented by knowledge unit with associated descriptions and procedures  . One type of conceptual entities is the use of hiearch cal relation which was actively utilized by the work of Carbonell's SCHOLAR  ( 1970 )  . In SRL , hiearchical concept is accomplished through part -whole and class-inclusion relations  . And further , the conflict resolution was made by the use of the without description  . In contrast to TOPLE , a bird like Pengin is represented by the following way  . 
(PENGIN unit ( self ( a TORI without ( has p = TOBU ) ) )   ( part of nil ) other descriptions ) 
Fig . lSRL's description for peng in
Although we made a quick overview of the related topic on the knowledge with conflict resolution  , it is necessary to consider a semantic model which can accept semantically conflict knowledge  . That is , any lexical item stored in the understanding system should process a change of meaning through the metaphorical use  . 
In this section , we will propose a new semantic model in which semantic elements are compared to chemical elements  . Here , chemical elements . are refered to the dynamic aspect of meaning . In a sense , the theory can be considered as an extension of Arnold Zwicky's  1973 paper , " Linguistics as Chemistry " , in Anderson & Kiparsky ( Eds . ), A Festschrift for Morris Halle . In this connection , some preliminary work on " Linguistic Chemistry " was carried out by Harada & Mizoguchi  ( 1977 ) in which semantics and lexical elements were also compared to chemical elements  ( such as molecules , atoms , protons , neutrons and elecrtons ) . A large part of syntax is now compared to a theory of semantic " bondage "  . 
The semantic equivalent of ' chemical reaction ' is a theory of semantic amalgamation  . The analogy with chemistry may not be completely felicitous  , but at the present moment it is a least useful in shaping a new theory of semantics  . 
The first step for constructing a chemically interpreted model of semantics  , or " Semistry " , so to speak , is to study the bondage among atoms and molecules  . For this , it is necessary to develop a theory of valence . 
Valence is defined as the capacity of an atom to enter into chemical  ( or semantic ) combination with other atoms . It is possible to assign a value to the valence displayed by an atom in particular compound  . This notion must be the reader who is well -informed of the European tradition of " Valenzgrammatik "  . 
Here , however , we will develop a theory of valence totally independently of European tradition  . 
Before going into a detail of Semistry , let us show you a concrete exsample which is selected from Schank  ( 1973 ) of his Coneepual Dependency theory ( CDT for short )  . Here , " Semantic primitives of CDT " are compared to chemical elements  . In the chemical elements , there are three types of chemical bondages ; i . 
Single bond 2. Doublebond 3. Tripplebond.
If we look at CDT representation of a sentence through the viewpoint of Semistry  , we will recognize a Similarity between chemical molecules and CD structure  . From this insight , we can make a analogy of semantic'isomer ' , depending on a mode of bondage between the semantic primitives  . For exsample , CD structure of PP ( picture producer ) and ACT ( action ) is represented in the Fig . 2 in which two way dependency is interpreted as a double bond in case of Semistry  . If one of the valence shifts to another pair of primitive as shown in Fig  .  2 , then the structure is called semantic resonance . 
In case of PP with the extravalence , some modifiers will be possible to link the activated part of PP  . If the activation will occur at the ACT , the extravalence part will be embedded with the related case in CDT  . 
Since it is not the purpose of the present paper to develop an impecable account of Semistry  , let us take another example from a lexical item which is related to the present study  . 
In the analysis of lexical structure , words are not really defined in the standard dictionaries in any precise way in case of the human cognitive system  . There are various means to be employed to indicate their meaning more or less vaguely  , but these means are usually sufficient for the cognitive processing  . They may be extralinguistic means ( such as diagram ) or linguistic definition , both explicit and implicit . Neither of these --137 modiiier case slot s <> t t 4-  -  . PP === At'r--a <>"~-- I'P---ACT "~<>' if  1   4---PI '---AC'I'--~""~pp---ACT~<>t 4-  . pp---ACT--~i " 1 <><> modifiers for I't's elaantie resonance extravaletlce case slots ~ or ACT Fig  .   2 Viewo\[semistry into Cutheroytot Semant ic resonance representatio B  . 
are of much use for the construction of metaphor processing system  . 
In case of metaphorical analysis , the lexical item must be defined with an inclusion of semantically unacceptable feature  . This is represented by the following way as shown in 

The format of lexical item is adapted by the use of distributed semantic links  ( or Singlebonds ) between words . That is , a word or lexical item is surrounded with semantic features SI  , S2 ,   . . . Sn . 
These bonds between word and semantic features are usually single bonds with homogeneous tention  . In that case , the resonance is observed among the semantic features of word  . In case of metaphorical semantic analysis , especially , noun-noun phase ,

the first noun modifies the second . So , the resonance is broken and the first noun in metaphorical relationship must include the meaning that is interpreted by the second  . 
Therefore , in order to determine the meaning of a noun phase  , there must be an intersection of meaning between M * and M  . If such intersection exsists between the first and the second  , the double bond is constructed in the Fig . 3 . In this way , word definition can be turned by adding procedure for unacceptable semantic link  . The process is regarded as semantic change of meaning from Semistry's viewpoint  . The change of meaning in metaphor is classified by the following categorical transformation as is shown in Table i  . 
Thus , the idea of Semistry is proposed so as to meet the present purpose of metaphor semantic analysis  . The experimental system 188-i . From Object to Human
Contextual transformation
M *= Object M = Human2 . Bond between Object and Human
Link transformation
M *= Object M = Human 3 . Transformation from Human body to Object,

M *= Human body M = Object & Location 4 . Animal & Location's Personification
M *= Animal & Location
M = Human 5. Pseudo-personification
M *= Object & Animal & Location & Abstract
M = personification's Object6 . From Abstract to Concrete Object M *= Abstract Object M = ConcreteObject 
Table I . Metaphorical Transformation called META-SIM is designed and tried out through the use of ELINGOL developed by Tanaka et al  ( 1978 )  . 
3 a Metaphor analysis of noun phrase
In this section , we show the case study based on the idea shown before  . At the first stage , we analyzed a noun-noun metahporusing ELINGOL couped with production system designed with a viewpoint of standard control structure  . 
The present studies focus on a noun phrase in metaphorical use in Japanese  , such as
I . Metaphor " noun + nou N "
II . Similei . M*nom*SIMM nom . ( m*ofM*SIMm of M ) 2 . M*nom*SIMM(orm) . ( m*ofM*SIMM(orm )) 3 . M * ( or m *) SIMM nom . ( M * ( or m *) SIMm of M ) 4 . M * ( or m *) SIMM(or m ) In the above notation , SIM represents a similarity between two nouns in Simile  , and a noun denoted a small letter is a part of noun denoted a capital letter  . 
In this case study , we use a ELINGOL ( Extended Linguistic Oriented Language ) for the parser ( systactic analyzer )  . The ELINGOL is a contexfree parser extended at ETL  , and it has a semantic processing parts that the user can write any semantic processing program in terms of LISP  . 

The description in dictionary used in this case study is as in Fig  . 4 Each dictionary item consists of four parts , the first is item of the word , the second is the syntactic category of the word , the third is the part used in case of some ambiguities  , ( MQMIJINQU~(HILO ) " ( MQMIJI
UMIT < SELFSHOKUBUTSU )   ( PRT-OPMID ( ~EM-FERTURE < SIZE = , ,4 , ~ ) CPRRT-OF-FEATURE ( H  ~ ( SIZE ~ CHIISQI ) ) ) ) )   )   ( TEIIOUN ( HILO )  "  ( TE
UNIT ( SELFNIL > ( PRT-OPNINBEM )   ( SEM-FEBTURE ( SIZE = ~ )   ( P-PROPERTY = ~ , e - ~ . ) ( METR-NOUtl(HSOFSH~U~UT~U )))))
Fig . 4 Dictionary the fourth is the part for representation which the word has  . 

In this case study , the knowledge of each word is expressed in terms of SRL knowledge representation  , as in Fig . 4 . 
Here , the framework of knowledge representation is constructed by a set of semantic feature and properties  , such as " TE ( hand ) " and " MOMIJI ( maple ) " in Fig . 4 . In the above representation , there are some special slots or semantic feature ? The SELF slot represents a semantic category of the noun for the top node in part-whole relation network  . 
PARTOF slot represents a upper node of the noun in part-whole relation network  . In SEM-FEATURE , PART-OF-FEATURE represents some special feature of the components of the noun  , and MATA-NOUN represents a restriction of the compared parts for the modifier noun category  . 

The description in grammar used in this case study is as shown in Fig  .  5 . 
( HPK(HDU . OD )( . IL 0 )   ( LG ) )  ( NPP ( HPKNOUH > NIL 0 )   ( CONS < LG )   ( LIST ( RG > ) ) )   ( IND ( JBRBJV ) < NILO ) O )   ( HP l ( MPPIMD )   ( NILO ) ? hG ) )  ttPH CI'tOUM IND ) eMIL 0 )   ( LG ) )  ( MP ( NDUHHDUH )   ( NILO )   ( NP ~_EM ( LG )   ( RG ) ) )   ( HP ( NP NN PP )   ( MILO )   ( MTSEM 3 ( h  ~ )   ( RG ) ) )   ( tIPIMPIH PP )   ( NILO )   ( MTSEMI ( LG )   ( RG ) ) )   ( ~ P ( MPNHOUN > ( NILO )   ( MTSEM 4~' LG )   ( RG ) ) ) MP ( NPINOUN )   ( NILO )   ( MTSEM 23 ( LG > ( RG ) ) )   ( HPL ( NPK HPI )   ( MIL 0 )   ( CONS ( LG )   ( RG ) ) )   ( NP ( NPLNOUM ~ ( NILO )   ( MTSEMI ( CDR ( L 6 ) )  ( COMS ( CAP ( LG ) )  ( LIST ( RG ) ) ) ) )   ( SENTENCE ~ P ( ~ , IL0~ , ~G ) )  ( $ EtITEHCE ( SENTEI~CEEND )   ( r11 L0 ) < LG ) ) Each grammar consists of four parts , the first and the second parts represent a contex free rule of A---B  ( C )  , the third is used in case of some ambiguities , and in the fourth part , we describe any semantic processing procedures . 
In Fig .  5 , the fourth part describe a LISP function for metaphorical semantic processing which is considered in the next section  . 
Procedure fo_j Metaj0horical semantic processing
First , a input string must be parsed through ELINGOL and produce a parsing tree which is one of the control structure for semantic analysis  . 
In order to interprete a noun phrase , a meaning of a phrase is constructed by seeking the semantic relation between noun and noun in  --139 the noun phrase . So , at first , two nouns to be interfered must be chosen , the choice is desided in terms of a syntactic structure and semantic part-whole relation network  , because , in Japanese , there are many paraphrase only one noun phrase that has same meaning  . 
Then , a new semantic interpretation is obtained from a intersection which is accomplished through the search of the two noun definitions  . When an intersection occurs , the system focuses the matched semantic features extracted in the search to construct an interpretation  . Thus , the search process corresponds to the conflict resolution process to produce the " infered meaning "  . In this way , interpretation of metaphorical use is accomplished  . 
Here , we show the detailed semantic procedure for each cases shown before  . 
( I ) noun-i+noun2, Metaphor
Toplevel function : NP SEM
Procedore:
By metaphorical interference between noun-I and noun2  , metaphorical semantics is obtained from a intersection of semantic features between two nouns  . 
( II-i ) M*nom*SIMM nom , Simile
Toplevel function : MTSEMI
Procedure:
First , by comparing noun semantic between M * and m * to that of M and m  , the system can decide the semantic of " M*nom * " and " Mnom "  . 
Then metaphorical semantics is obtained by contrasting noun phrase semantic between the semantic of " M*nom *" and that of " Mnom "  . 
(II-2) M*nom*SIMM(orm ), Simile
Toplevel function : MTSEM 23
Procedure:
First , by comparing two noun semantics between M * and m  *  , the system can decide the semantic of " M*nom *"  , then metaphorical semantic is obtained by contrasting the semantic between " M*nom *" and M  ( or m )  . 
(II-3)M*(orm*)SIMM nom , Simile
Toplevel function : MTSEM 3
Procedure:
First , by comparing noun semantic between M and m , the system can decide the semantic of " Mnom " . In this type , noun phrase contrasting has three types . The first type is in case that m * of M * is omitted because of m *= m  . In this case , by comparing noun semantic between M * and m * ( = m )  , the system can decide the semantics of " M*nom  *"  , and then , metaphorical semantics is obtained by contrasting noun phrase semantic between " M*nom *" and " Mnom "  . The second type is in case that m * of M * is omitted but m * is restricted by META-NOUN description m *' of m  . In this case , by comparing noun semantic between M * and m *' , the system can decide the semantic of " M*nom *'"  , and then , metaphorical semantics is obtained by contrasting noun phrase semantic between " M * nom ~''' and " Mnom "  . The third type is other cases . In this case , by comparing semantic between M * ( or m * ) and that of " Mnom " . 
(II-4)M*(orm*)SIMM(orm ), Simile
Toplevel function : MTSEM 4
Procedure:
In this type , semantic procedure is as same as type ( II-3 ) without comparing noun semantic between M and m .

Fig .   6 Metaphor processing for " MOCHIHADA " Result shown in F  ig?6 is to deal with noun-noun metaphor " MOCHIHADA  ( as of t white sk in ) " . The intersection occurs at the semantic feature 's description  , then the slot of " P-PROPERTY " is filled in the semantic feature of " MOCHI  ( rice cake ) " . 
Next case study shown in Fig . 7 is to deal with " MOMIJINOY OUNATE ( handlike a smaple ) " known as " Simile " . 
Tree structure represents a result of parsing , and it is one of the control structure of semantic processes  . In this semantic process , first , noun " MOMIJI ( maple ) " and " HA ( leaf ) " are interfered for noun phrase and produce a new unit which means " MOMIJINOHA  ( leaf of maple ) " . Then , new unit " HA ( leaf ) " and noun " TE ( hand ) " of someone are interfered for metaphorical use , and produce a final result . 
And , other case study " DAIKONNOY OUNA
HANAKON OASHI ( leg of HANAKO like as DAIKON ) " and its paraphrase " HANAKONOD AIKONNOY OUNA ASHI " are metaphorically analyzed into the same semantic structures shown in Fig  . 8 and Fig . 9 . 
In this case , the syntactic analysis is much complex as is compared to the noun-noun phrase  , and semantic process is as like as before .

Fig . 9 Metaphor processing for " HANAKO NO DAIKON NO YOUNAAHI " process in metaphorical interpretation for noun phrases  . In order to make the discussion more explicit , we have reviewed the problem on i conflict resolution both from cognitive psychology and artificial intelligence  . 
Especially , we have made our attention to the problem of knowledge representation in human longterm memory and AI system  . In this connection , the procedure for dealing with semantically unacceptable knowledge is stressed for the understanding of metaphor  . That is , we have considered the dynamic aspect of meaning for word or lexical item in metaphor  . 
In order to penetrate the problem on representation of meaning in metaphor  , the idea of " Semistry " is introduced so as to analyze the conflict resolution in semantic interpretation  . The idea of Semistry has been derived from the notion of Zwicky's paper on " Linguistics as Chemistry " which is metaphorical interpretation on Chemistry  . By applying the notion into semantic structure of lexical item  , the dynamic aspect of meaning is explaind by introducing the idea of " semantic bonds " which have further constructed semantic resonance among semantic features  . A usual meaning is determined from the single bonds between word and semantic features  . In order to determine the meaning of noun-noun phrase metaphor  , there must be an intersection of meaning between the first and the second nouns  . 
This kind of intersection is accomplished through the procedure for finding the matched semantic properties of the first and the second nouns  . 
The proposed semantic model is designed and tried out for dealing with the noun phrase metaphor through the use of ELINGOL  . Here , by parsing tree and LISP function in grammar , the inference system to resolve the conflict of semantic interpretation of metaphor was constructed  . That is , the metaphor processing system would comprise a lexical item or word and associated inference mechanism to extract the meaning of metaphor  . In order to proof the idea , the working system for the noun phrase is implemented by means of UCI-LISP  ( DEC-20 ) or HLISP ( HITAC8 800-8700 ) and tried out with case studies . 
As the conclusions , we have shown a possibility for approaching a semantic analysis of metaphor from an actual working system  . 
These cases are selected from the book called " A Stylistic Study of the Figuratives "  ( Nakamura ,  1977) . At the present state , number of items in dictionary is about 150 . 
First , a new semantic model is proposed for dealing with metaphor  . The idea of semantic resonance is introduced to explain " semantic bonds " which is derived from the comparison with Linguisticas Chemistry  . 
Therefore , a role of metaphor is demonstrated in the present semantic model  . 
Second , the ELINGOL is utilized to unify the syntactic processing with the associated inference mechanism to extract metaphorical interpretation  . 

Third , metaphor processing system called META-SIM is designed and tried out through case studies  . We have discussed our experiences which was based upon the results of working system for metaphor processing system  . 
Although the present system and case studies are restricted to the noun-noun phrase  , the meaning of smaller phrase can be useful to build up semantic analysis of larger phrase of metaphor  . In this sense , the present study is the first step toward the semantic analysis of metaphor which has not been explored in the natural understanding system  . And further , the study of metaphor will give us about much more fruitful inference mechanism for interpreting semantically unacceptable sentence  . In the future , the role of metaphor must investigate for both educational purpose and design philosophy of any understanding system  .
