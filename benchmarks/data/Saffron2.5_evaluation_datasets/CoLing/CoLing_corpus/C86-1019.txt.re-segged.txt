Nethodological problems in Men\[ague Grammar are discussed  . Our observations show that a model theoretic approach to natural language semantics is inadequate with respect to its verifiabili ty from logical point of view  . But , the formal attitudes seem to be of use for the development in computational linguistics  . 

In this paper we discuss the methodology of veri fiability taken by researchers on model theoretic semantics for natural language such as ~ on tague ~ rammar  . 
Though Montague grammar ( hereafter MG ) has been developing since the publication of Montague\[lO\]  , there has been few serious studies of its ' sense ' and methodology  . 
Ne take the purpose of semantics to be as follows.
I ?, ( a ) To define a mean Lng.
( b ) To define a ' meaning ' of certain linguist-it expressions  . 
( c ) To generalize a ' meaning ' referred as ( h ) in connection with internal world ( human ) and external world . 
ltere ( a ) is so abstract that it must hedicussed in general linguistic terms rather than in MG  . But it is no doubt that the methodologies in ~ G are based on the assumption  ( c )  . The problem ( c ) is central to MG . In MG semantic structure corresponding to syntactic structure of natural language is realized by means of its methodologies  . 
The problem ( c ) is closely related with pragmatlcs and epistemology thus HG includes parts of them  . As Chomsky's early transformational grammar was obliged to changes of the system for the sake of autonomous syntax hypothesis  , the problem is important in MG . lntensional and possible-world semantic ~ could solve parts of the problems  . But it is difficult to ~ ay that MG is a system facilitating  ( c )  . And methodological problems of MG including ( c ) are mainly ascribed to model the orj underlying MG  . Neshall focus on the point and discuss ~ G's methodology  . Ezpecially following problems are investigated . 
(1 ) Isin\[arts\[anallogic necessary ? ( 2 ) Canmodal ( tense ) logic express a modality ( tense ) in natural language ? ( 3 ) Is first-order logic necessary ? ( 4 ) Is there a possibility of natural logic ? ( bOA rethere appropriate methods for the interpretation of logical form ?  ( 6 ) Is the readistinction between logical words and content ~ rds in natural language ? ~  , MG and ~ ode\[ Thepr2 The purpose of model theory is to investigate the relationships between a true statement in some formal language and its model  . Namely , it is to define a concept of ' truth ' in some mathematical structures  . In mathematical logic Tarski\[14\] first attempted to study the idea of model . In his paper Tarskima inly concerned himself with the definition of truth  ( the correct definition of a true sentence )  , lie confined his discussions to the object in the framework of predicate logic in the sense modern logic  , liedes paired to define a true sentence in natural langufige  . Since we are obliged to face to paradoxes for the sake of universality of natural language  . But he suggested that there exists a possibili ty of application of the resutt ~ for model theory  , which he gave to the language he called ' formalized language '  , to natural language . 

About forty years after the publication , Hontague , who is a disciple of his , could give a model theory for natural language . Moatague regarded intensional logic as a basis of his theory so as to overcome complexities of natural language  . He was able to solve paradoxes , that Frege and others faced , by means of intensional logic . 
First we consider the problems of intensional logic  . The model of intenslonal logocomes to be more complicated because it has a greater descriptive power than predicate logic in general  . AsGall\[hi3\]pointedout , valid formulas in intension a\[logic fail to constitute a recurs\[rely enumerable set since it is essentially based on type theory  . Thus we have no axiomatization for this logic . For this reason , we must restrict the scope of sentences in natural language capable of being treated by intensional logic  . But the notation of intens~on allogic used in PT fisuch as '" and ' ~' work efficiently for analysis  , For example , consider the following sentences . 
Every man loves a man . (11)
We have two interpretations for the sentences , namely , ( every man ) ( loves a man . )(I2) ( every man loves )( a man . ) ( i3) In general we call ( i2) de dictereading , (I3) dere reading , and obtain the following translations respectively  , Vx(man'(x)-->love'(x , ' ~ Q~y(~oman'(y)AQy )) . 

By ( woman ' (5 , ) AVx(man'(x ) --> love'(x , * ~ PP y ))) . 

Seen from the above formulas , in ( 12 ) that every man loves is not an individual ' woman ' bat a property of property of a individual ' woman '  . I hat is , the meaning of individuals ( inteesion ) is considered as a mapping from possible-worlds to a reference  ( extension )  . If t . e define a possible-world as a set of indices , and determine the value for each index , then some extension is defined . But we doubt that an intenslon defined in intensional logic properly represents a meaning  . 
In MS individuals and truth values are assumed as semantic primitives  . Using possible-world semantics we can extend predicate logic  . This extension causes the atructure of model to be more complex  , and produce slots of contradictions as natural language semantics  . Above all the problems of logical enuivalence is serious  . For example , assume a and h for logically equivalent formulas , that is , a and b are true in same indices . 
Then it is a valid inference from doubt ( p , ' a ) to doubt ( p , ' b ) . If we doubt a , we would doubt blogically equivalent to a from the standpoint of logically equivalence thus for p  , a and b have differernt meanings . To put it more correctly , the meaning of ' doubt ' in a and b is different unless pknows the correct sense of logically equivalence between a and b  . 
Such a statement fails to be explained in tradltonal logic  . This is nothing but a limitation of ordinary mode\[theory  . Researchers such as geen an \[8\] ,   Thomason\[15\] and Turner\[1G \] tried to extend tntension ailogic from various viewpoints  . Thomas on added intensional logic to third type of propositions  , which is a denotation of a sentence . Thus we clearly need a domain containing at least two propoaition a of a model for intone\[anal logic  . Eeen an introduced the concept of 9ntple ~caly perfection , that is , the element of the ontology are poasible denotaton a for extensions for expressions  , by means of Boolean algebra . ~ is motivation is to restrict a domain of intenslonal logic  . 
Thus the set of possible world is defined in terms of ~ Oxlmally conslstent sot of propositions  , sentence denotations . 
T urner\[16j extended intenslon ai 1ogle in the sense of type-free theory in which a self -annlication is permitted for the treatment of nominalizations  . We are very intere : ; ting in such strategies since in Scott-type denotational semantics we have no intermediate language as in PTQ  . Thus we can obtain semantic interpretation of a sentence directly  . We have an idea for types of natural language , namely , polvmorohic types , which can have various types . These types are essentially considered as a subset of type-free theory  . 
Above mentioned trials are restrictions to a mode\[for intensional logic  . But such perplexed constructions muct cause us more difficulties in reality  . Hunt we give up thi . ' ~ logic ? It is certain though intension ailogic has the sides against our intuitions  , it can provide a powerful model for some phenomena  . For example , consider the following sentences referred to as ~ sadox  . 
( I ) The temperature is ninety.
(2) The tempera rureises.
(3) Ninetyrises.
The ~ eare translated into formulas in intensional logic as:  ( I ) ~ y ( Vx ( temerature ' ( x ) <--> x = y ) ^" y = n )   ( 2 ) ~ y ( Vx ( temerature ' ( x ) <--> xy )   . ~ rise '( y )) (3) rise '(' n) .   ( I-7 ) As seen from ( ? ) Hontague dealt with noun phrases as objects which have intensions and extensions  . In the examples , intensions are represented as functions that denote some number at each index  , and extensions are rendered as particular number such as  90 at certain index . Namely , the truth value of sentence ( 2 ) in ( 16 ) depends not on extension but on intension . For this reason verbs such as ' rise ' referred to as intensional verb  . . . ~ . But such for ~ lism seem to be recaputuiated in the framework of predicate logic  . If so , it is effective from not only intuitive but also computational point of views  . ~ Such formalisms are divided into b #o approaches  . One is an approach that is an extension of predicate logic to intensional logic using some devices as in Schubert and  Pelletier\[13\]  . Another is an approach that intensionn I logic is interpreted as a programming language such as LISP as in Hobbs and Rosenschein\[G\]  . Schubert and Pelletier stated that predicate logic is suitable from the viewpoint of A\[ systems  . According to them , the expressions in intensional logic are not comprehensive to human being  . 
For example , it is better understandable to capture definite noun phrases as individuals than a set of properties  . Slot representations conquest gaps to intensional  . In this formulation a proper name is represented as a constant  , a common oun as a monadl cpedicate and a transit ivever b as a binary predicate  . 
' Hary '=:> Hary I ' boy '"=> ( Iliboy )   ( I-8 ) ' loves ' ~ :> ( litloves tt2 ) ltere ~ n is called argument slot that is fil led from higher number in turn  . The sentence ( i2 ) and ( i3 ) are translated as follows . 
dedlcto:foralI ( ~Iman )   ( (~ I loves 112 )   ( for some ( 112 woman ) ) ) ==> YX ( Xman )  =->  ( xloves A-~y ( ywoman ) ) )   ( i -9 ) dere : for som . ( l ; ~ woman ) (Ill oves ltg ) (for a l l ( illman ) ) "=>~ y ( (y woman ) A ( Vx ( xman ) --> x loves y ) )  ( i-I0 ) These translations are similar to the formulas in predicate logic  , ltere slot representations enable us to operate a scoplng of noun phre~es  . This device seems to have some simulating with combinators in combinatory logic  . 
Ilobbs and Rosensche intried to convert intensional logic to S-expressions in LISP  . The lambda expressions are considered as the pure LISP thus the conversion is plausible  . Such expressions are exemplified as follows . 
(constant )  -:>  ( QUOTE ~ ( ) m ( a variable of type < s , b > for any b )  ==>  ( \[ IUOTE ~ ( ) " W "> ( LIST ( QUOTEQUOTE , S )( i-\[i ) " ~ , -> EVALo ( The sentence ( l ) in ( I-7 ) is translated inninety == > ( L , ~ BDA(Q ) (( g ~) ( INT * 90)) be ==> ( L , 1NBDA(P ) ( LA , ~ B D Aix )   ( ( P * )   ( INT ~ ( LA ~ BDA ( y )   ( EOU ~ L ( X * )   ( Y D ) ) ) ) ) ) ) the temperature ==> ( LAHBDA ( P ) (FOR SO , ' IEENTITY-COYCEPTS(LAY , BDA(Y ) ( FORALL
E , ~ITITY-CONCE PTS ( LA , ' iBDA ( X )   ( At ~ D ( IFF ( TEHPX ) (EQUAL X Y ) ) ( (P~ ) Y ) ) ) ) ) ) ) the temperature is ninety == > ( ( TIIE ( FUNCTIO ~ ITEHP ) )  ( INT ~ ( B E ( INT ~ ( FUNCTION NUIETT ) ) ) ) INT ~ ( L , ~ HBDA ( G )   ( LAHBDA ( * ) G ) )  ( i-12 ) Here we may assume there is a variab I enamed * to the value of which are applied to produce the corresponding extensions  . Above two trials are for approximating the functions of lntensional logic by means of simpler ~ ystem in order to reduce inherited complexities in this logic  . In any case deficiencies of intension a I logic are ascribed to model theory  , and even if we take it off , it is doubtful that intension formulated in intensional logic corresponds to the meaning of l inguistic expressions  . 
Next we consider tense logic and modal logic . As both logic . ~ are based on possible-world semantics we come to facet be name problems in  genera1  , tlere ~ Je discuss the problems involved in direct app\[ications to natural language  . In tense logic the operators P and T are able to apply in finitely in principle but in practlce the scope of tense has some boundary  . Thus it is not easy to solve tense in natural language only by the set ~ o operators  . Bauerle\[2 ~ introduced third operator T ( it is the case on .   .   . that .   .   .   ) so as to overcome shortcomings of traditional tense logic as in the axiomatization by  Priori13\]  . In tense logic the following relations hold . 
FF~-->F~(113)
PPP-->P@(114)
The ~ e formulas are proved by means of the transit lvlty of <  . Such relations assume all forms of the past ( future ) tense as quantification over times past ( future )  . But to avoid the infinite application of tense operators we must take a strategy that tense can be considered as a point of reference by Reichenhach  . 
That is , we can regard past tense as direct reference to some particular past time  , not universal quantification . 
Similarly in modalogic it is doubt that the t~o operators enable us to explain the modality of natural language  . First of all modalities are divided into the o ~ . ctive and the su___bb\]ec__tive . And modal logic can manage only objective modali Ly  . Suppose the folloNing examples . 
John cannot be a Japanese . (1-I5)
It is impossible John is a Japanese .   ( 116 ) If we translate these sentences into formulas in ~G we obtain the one in only  ( I-16 )  . 
~ Q Japanese ' ( j )   ( = I : I ~ Japanese ' ( j ) )  ( I-17 ) In other words the sentence in ( 115 ) belong to the category of snbjective modality thus it is impossible that the subject is a logical connection of the function to each constihmnt  ( namely content word ) in the statement rather than some kind of operation to the statement  ( namely truth value )  . Unfortunately , most of the modalities in natural language belong to objective modality  . We can state that semantic " , in logic is not always linguistically valid .   Chomsky\[3\] called HG a type of descriptive semantic ~ except that hethlnk ~ it is not semantics really  , in the sense that it does not deal with the classical questions of semantics such as the relation between language and the world  . 
The situations do not change even if we restrict logic to predicate logic  . And if we want predicate logic to be psychologically real  , though we will discuss thin in section 2 in detail , we will reply in negative due to Lowenheim -Skolem ' n theorem  . 
When we interpretheso called logical forms , if we depend on the idea of intension a logic , it happens a lot of irrationalities . Namely , the interpretation is nothing but a decision procedure of truth condition  . 
Since ~ G is based on Fr ~ , the truth value is difficult to add interpretation of linguistic constralnt ~ to the system of formal logic  . Thus Natural Logic was proposed .   Lakoff\[9\] said that the semantic structure of natural language co ~ responds to the grammar tlcal structure and that Natural Logic must be able to explain logical inferences in natural language  . 
Thus it is possible to consider that Natural Logic possesses similar framework to TG rather than HG  . From the standpoint of Gg theory in TG , II or nstain\[?\]pur:ueted logical forms , lie claimed that semantics should also he exp\ [ ained from the same hypotheses  ( hmateness ) as syntax . We think that his approach is more realistic and rational theory if such theories are to be formalized in view of psycho\[egg  . We can find a similar approach , though it may be more ambitious , in Johnson-Laird\[8! . Necessity of Natural Logic seems to be derived from the drawbacks of formal logic owing to its artificallty  . As we take up the sixth problem before , there is a clear distinction between logical words and content words  , and we faced strict type constraints . ~ ost inferences in natural language are executed by means of logical words  . In an extreme terms , we can infer only if ~ e know inference rules . But our dai Iy inference seem to depend on the property of content words  . 
We therefore need the counterpart of inference rules in logic for inferences depended on content ~ ords  . 
The abuse of mean as postulates at lexica I level provide no solution  . Since Natural Logic is based on the principle of universal grammar in grammartical theory  . But if Natural Logic adopts predicate logic as a device for logical forms  , it is impossible that the logic overcome its di fficulties  . 
2. ~ and tln ~ uisti ? Theor ',
Finally we shall investigate into philosophlcal aspects of ~ g  . We can find fenre search involved in the issues of methodology and philosophy in HG  . ? The exception is Partee\[ll\] . She tried to justify theoretical validity of MG in connection with psychological reality  . Hen\[ague himself apprared to reconstruct l inguistic soathe basis of the same method o\[ogy in mathematics  , thus there ex\[stanopsychological factor here . Dowty\[~\]also stands in the position that semantics is a field handling the reIationships between linguistic exprssio as and external worlds  . Are there hypotheses in ~G in different place from our mind ? We hard to receive such radical opinions  . Even if we discover reality in ~ G , it is doubtful whether theoretical validity of HG is verified  . 
For example , we have the assumption that individuals and truth values are semantic primitives in ~ G  . What is an individual ? At a first glance individuals are grasped at ease  , but we can never clarify what it is . 
The assumption of model theory says that a set of individuals is never empty in some structure  . Suppose a possible-~orld that consists of only humans as its elements  . Even if this set has countably in finite power , it will be empty some day because humans are mortal  . This contradict : the assumption . Hare doubtful factist m ~ individuals corresponding to dead humans are represented in a model  . And , by Lowenheim-Skolem's there to there exists a countable model if a model exists  . 
This impties that we have difficulties to identify a set of individuals in its model  . Can~efind verifiabillty and reality in such concepts ? Now we cannot deny a human semantic competence  . 
Parteederided level of semantics into t~oparts and insisted that semantics in lexica\[levelia a mental par ~  . The claims ho~s that it is improper to advance model theoretic approaches in ~ g to linguistic lever  . 
llere we recognize many problems in her insistence ? According to her argument  , it is realistic to choose appropriate individuals and possible-worlds in models of intensionalogic and Hontague's attempt is to define not a unique intensional modot but a family of models  . 
We believe human can never recounize such models in his possible-worlds and choose opt\[maiworld by means of the mechanisms as \[ nductiou  . This idea ' is very suspicious but we do not know how to to verify it now  . That is , the specification of a particular actual model , $ dlichs he called , cannot be ' realistic ' if we use model theoretic semantics as intensional  ( or predicate ) logic . 
From above consider at \[ ons , we Nlll conclude the following . Lingulstic ~ is a part of philosophy rathe : " than psychology  . Since psychology has not complete systems , we do not intend to say psychology i ~ an incomplete study  , the object of semantics is bo~hhuma a ~ ourselves and external worlds  . Of course we can mention that methodology in ~ G is a small part of our internal world  . ~e want to insist that we ought to unify pragmatics as ~ G provided the ~ ay unifying syntax and semantics  . ~ ethodology in ~ G must be a foothold of it . 
At that time it does not matter whether there exists a reality in the methodology  . The important hing is that such a methodology can constitute a part of realistic linguistic theory  . \ [ nother words , logical forms may be interpreted both more logically and psychologically  . 
After all we can oniy see the worlds through tinted glasses  , namely our language . To make matters worse , we never take of four glasses . Living things such as bees and birds may look the ~ or lds in more effective ways  . 
And we want to know abner the worlds more . To do so , we come to set down our tinted lense . In the case of ~ G its settings are performed by model theory  . If the degree of lenses lipdown we will look at the world in strayed eyes  . If we fall into the case , we should reflect on ourselves again . This reflection MII cause us to find the way hew to know natural language better  .
