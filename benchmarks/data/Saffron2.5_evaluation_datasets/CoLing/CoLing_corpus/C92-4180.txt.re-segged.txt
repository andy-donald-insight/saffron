The main purpose of communication is to exchange information  . Any discourse understanding model should be able to process the flow of information throughout the entire text  . According to DuBois ( 1987 ) 's studies of information flow in discourse across a number of languages  , information distribution among argument positions in clauses is by no means random  , but cemd ngrammatical patterns tend to recur consistently  . He thus formulated a Preferred Argument Structure  ( PAS ) for the preferential structural configurations of arguments  . In our examination of Chinese narrative discourse  , the language also displays PAS , yet the Chinese PAS challenges timuniversality of the one DuBo is proposed  . 
Based on the quantity and distribution of lexical arguments and new referents across grammatical roles in discourse  , it is realized that Chinese PAS also maintains one new argument at most within a basic information processiug unit  . Since new referents in Chinese have to be encoded in full NP form  , it is thus less likely to have more than one lexical argument within a clause  . Moreover , this single new argument appears preferentially in the Orole  , rather than the A and S roles DuBois's PAS formulates  . 
Since the structure of information flow has a correspond in grammatical patterning  , both grammatical and pragmatic processing can be carried out simultaneously  , in that the information status of an argument can be identified by virtue of grammatical analysis  . 
Althougll PAS is neither universal nor categorical  , it can function in a discourse understanding model as heuristic device to process the information structure of a connected spoken discourse  . 
According to DuBois ( 1987 ) 's studies of information flow in discourse across a number of languages  , information distribution among argument positions is neither arbitrary nor random  , but certain grammatical patterns are preferred over others  , especially they tend to recur consistently in a connected spoken discourse  , hi other words , the structure of information flow has a corresponding grammatical patterning  . Those recurrent patterns , which indeed reflect speakers ' actual language use  , are formulated as Preferred
Argument Structure ( PAS ) The PAS he formulated comprises the following constraints : One Lexical Argument Constraint to avoid more than one referent in full NP form per clause  , Non-Lexical A Constraint to have the single lexical referent not appearing in the A role  , One New Argument Constra into avoid more than one referent carrying new information per clause  , Given A Constraint to have the new referent not appeariug in the A role  . However , in examining Chinese narrative discourse , it is discovered that the PAS that this particular type of discourse genre displays challenges the universality of DuBois's  . The idiosyncrasy of the Ct linese PAS will be discussed in this paper  . 
in fact , from the computational point of view , no matter it is universal or language-specific , the existence of PAS has significant implication to discourse understanding  . On the one band , it enables grammaticalnd pragmatic processing being carried out simultaneously because the information status of a referent can be identified by virtue of grammatical nalys is  ; on the other hand , PAS can function as heuristic device to process the information structure of a connected discourse  . 
1. Introduction
The main purpose of communication is to exchange intbrmation  . On the part of a speaker , he may employ various strategies to organize the information he intends to couve y  , in that some bear old information while others carry new information  . Therefore , a discourse understanding model should be able to process the flow of information throughout the entire text  . In this paper , our issue is tbcused on the referring arguments in Chinese narrative discourse  , and our main concern is how they are structured in relation to infom~ationflow  . 
2. Preferred Argument Structure in
Chinese Narrative Discourse
Unlike the languages DuBoish as studied (1987) , Mandarin Chinese is a typologically different language with no inflection and relatively free word order  . Nevertheless , it still exlfibits its own idiosyncratic PAS in spoken narrative discourse  . The corpus for the present study comprises eight or alnarratives as told by eight Mandarin native speakers of  2025 years old . They were requested to describe the story about thc popular movie G host to the interviewer in a speech laboratory  . It portrayed AcrEs DI3 COLING 92 , NAV , ' II ! S , 2328 aOl':r19921142 PROC .

The uarratives were taped for later transcription . 
To study the Chinese PAS , our examination is focused on the issues of quantity and role iu distributing lexical arguments and new referents across grammatical positions at both the grammaticalnd pragmatic dimensions  . 
2.1 Preliminaries for Analysis
Segmentation f the 120 minutes long narratives was subject o intonation unit being identified by eat ' as at stretch of speech uttered under a single coherent intonation contour and typically bounded by a pause  . Chafe ( 1987 ) hlts hypothesized that intonation units representing linguistic expressions of focuses of consciousness are independent processing units typical of spoken discourse  . In the present corpus , there were a total of 1433 intonation units , with a mean length of 6 . 69 words . The fact that the clause being defined as a verb and its arguments  , and the intonation unit often coincide ( Du Bois , 1987; Chafe ,  1987 , 1988) was further confirmed in this study , sittce 85 . 28%  ( 1222 ) intonation units contained clausal elements . Those units comt ~ rised false starts , repetitions , filled pauses , as well as clause fragments such as conjunctions , adverbials , and particles would be excluded from further analysis  . Therefore , tile study of Chinese PAS is indeed based on chmses  . 
Following is a sample of five clausal intonation units  ( ae ) produced by a female speaker : ( 1 ) a . jiouyitiantagenzh et an upengy ou one day he follow his girlfriend'Oneday  , he followed his girlfriend . ' b . zaitan upengyouji ~ dideshihou in bisgir lfriend homewhen ' When  ( he was ) in his gM friend's tlome , ' c . lanupengy ouz cdhuanyifu his girlfriend PROG change clothes'his girlfriend was changing clothes  . ' d . ranhou you yige huztiren then the re-be one CI ~ badguy ' Then  , there was a badguy . ' e . huairenchuangfinial badguy break in ' The bad guy broke in  . ' Within a single clause , the molphological type of each referent , its gramnlatical role , as well as information status were all recorded . 
The morphological type of an overt referent in Chinese was either a lexical NP or a pronoun  , whose surface grammatical role would be classified as A  ( transitive subject )  , S ( intransitive subject ) , O(transitive object ) , or Oblique ( object of a preposition ) . Furthermore , Chafe ( 1987 ) 's three-way distinction of information tbr referents was adopted  , mainly because his categories lay their foundation on the actual cognitive processing of information transfer by language users  . They were given information , accessible information , and new information . A given referent referred to the entity mentioned previously  , while a new refi~rent was the one that haduot yet been brought up in the prior context  . Internlediate between these two was accessible information  , either coming from the expectations asociated with a schema or resulting ti ~ om deactivation from an earlier state  . Following DuBois (1987) , a referent constituted by deactivation should be at least twenty propositions away from its most recent appeluance operationally  . 
2.2 The Grammatical Dimension of PAS
The purpose of studying PAS at the grammatical dimension is to examine whether there is a prefen 'ed surface configuration of arguments in the observe data  . Therefore , we investigate both the number of lexical ( NP ) argmnents and their distribution across the granunatical roles in clauses  . 
According to our tabulation shown in Table I , of the 1127 clauses ( excluding the equational type )  , those with zero or one lexical argument are the most common structure which constitute a distinct majority  ( 94 . 15%) .

Total 1127 100 ( X2.99(2) = 399.89)
Since only transitive verbs can take more than one argument  , it is necessary to seperate them from the intransitive ones for tabulation  , in ca ~ the rarity of two-lexical-argument structures is imply due to tilermity of transitive clauses  . 
The result in " Fable 2 shows clearly that even intransitive constructions  , two-lexical-argument structures are still a minority  ( 9 . 17%) . \]' he result indeed supports DuBois's One Lexical Arguanent Cot ~' traint in that " there is a tendency for speakers to avoid more than one lexical argument per clause "  ( p . 819) .

According to our tabulation as shown in Table 3 , it is realized that O(84 . 3%) and Oblique (92 . 31% ) each contain an overwhelming proportion of lexical arguments  , whereas A and S contain a smaller portion of them .

(3) = 91 . 17 ) Unlike DuBois's Non-Lexical A Constraint to avoid lexical referents appearing in the A position  , Chinese speakers would not prefer the A and S roles to mention a referent lexically  . It is the position O ( or Oblique ) that preferentially favors lexical arguments . The Lexical 0 Constraint is thus proposed to characterize this particular phenomenon i Chinese narrative discourse  . In short , the One Lexical Argument Constraint and the Lexical  0 Constraint , which are indeed the constraints on quantity and role respectively  , constitute the Chinese PAS at the grammatical dimension  . The quantity of lexical argument within a clause is usually one at most  , and this single argument preferentially appears in the Orole  . Although they are not categorical rules , they do represent a statistically significant tendency of actual language use  . 
2.3 The Pragmatic Dimension of PAS
In the preceding section , it has been shown that in narrative discourse different argument positions of a clause have distinct morphological preferences  . This section aims at studying the pragmatic dimension of PAS by examining the quantity of new arguments  , as well as their distribution across the grammatical roles  . 
Firstly , it is found that transitive and intransitive clauses either contain zero or one new referent  , with the former predominating (81 . 06%), as indicated by Table 5 . 
Significantly , not a single clause contains two new referents . The result supports DuBois's One New Argument Constraint o " avoid more than one new argument per clause "  ( p . 826) .

Total 572 1002 411008 13100()199(1) = 18 . 01 ) To understand whether the single new referent is randomly distributed across A  , S , O , and Oblique , it is necessary to examine the distribution of information across these positions  . As indicated in Table 6 , a substantial proportion of A and S carry old information  , and new referents preferentially occur in O and

Since Chinese speakers disfaw ) r both the A and S roles to mention a new referent  , DuBois's Given A Constraint , which " avoids introducing a new referent in the A-role argument position "  ( p . 827) , is inappropriate to Chinese narrative discourse . The New 0 Constraint is then proposed for Chinese to characterize the free occurrence of new referents in the Orole  , as well as the high restriction in the A and S roles  .

This can be explained by the fact that Chinese includes a type of presentative construction which " performs the function of introducing into a discourse a norm phrase naming an entity "  ( Li & Thompson ,  1981) . Verbs of this sentence type are usually intransitive  , and the following arguments usually carry new information  . Since speakers do not necessarily use presentative constructions to introduce a new entity  , they merely constitute a minority ( 20 clauses ) in our corpus , as exemplified in (2) and (3) .

'  ( 3 ) fie shang you yige zhao paiy as tree tonexist one CL sign board PART ' On the street  , here is a sign board . ' In short , the OneNew Argument Constraint and the New 0 Constraint constitute the Chinese PAS at the pragmatic dimension  . 
There is a strong tendency in discourse to limit the number of new ~ ugument in a clause to a maximum of one  . This single new referent tends to be introduced in the O  ( or Oblique ) role and the second occurrences preferentially appear in the A and S roles  . It is of course this preponderance of old information found in the A  , S alignment that gives Chinese the distinction of being a topic-prominent language  . 
2 . 4 Corre lat ion of PAS between Grammatical and Pragmatic Dimensions We have already studied the quantity and the role constraints that constitute PAS for Chinese narrative discourse at both the grammatical nd pragmatic dimensions  . The correlation of PAS between these two dimensions is ostrong that the grammatical One Lexical Argument Constraint and Lexical  0 Constraint are parallel to the pragmatic One New Argument Constraint and New  0 Cor ~ traint respectively , as shown in Table 8 . In other words , the most preferred structure is to have one new argument at most within a single clause  . Since new referents in Chinese have to be coded in full NP form  , it is thus less likely to include more than one lexical argument within one discourse unit  . Moreover , there is a strong tendency for the single new argument to appear in the Orole  , so that the lexical referent typically appear in this particular position  . The flow of information does have a corresponding grammatical patterning  .

Comparing the Chinese PAS with the one
DuBo is proposed for the languages he has studied such as Sacapultec Maya  , as shown in Table 9 , it is obvious that DuBois's PAS cannot completely be generalized to Chinese  , at least the narrative discourse genre is concerned  . 
Their difference lies in the distribution of lexical ACRESOE  COLING-92  , NANII ~ S , 2328 AOI\]T 1992 1145 PROC . OFCOLING-92, NANTES , Ant; .  2328 ,   1992 arguments and new referents across grammatical roles  . As the PAS in Sacapulte cavoids mentioning new lexical arguments in the A role  , Chinese speakers disfavor both the A and S roles and strongly prefer O  .

Chinese , like a number of other languages whose pattern of information flow in spoken narrative discourse has been investigated to date  , also exhibits PAS . This suggests that there is a strong discourse pressure driving the various grammatical patterning in different languages  , o that the universality of the PAS Du Bois proposed encounters challenge  . 
However , from the computational point of view , no matter whether PAS is universal or language -specific  , its existence has significant implication to discourse understanding  , in that the flow of information throughout a connected discourse is highly structured with a corresponding grammatical patterning as far as quantity and role are concerned  . Therefore , it is possible to identify the information status of an argument by virtue of grammatical nalys is  , so that both grammaticalnd pragmatic processing can be carried out simultaneously  . Even though PAS is not categorical in nature , a discourse understanding model can still use it as heuristic device to process the information structure of a connected spoken discourse  . 
In short , a discourse understanding model employing PAS for information processing should take the following points into consideration :  ( a ) Clauses are the basic information processing units  . 
( b ) Transitive and intransitive clause should be seperated for analysis  . 
(c ) The morphological type , grammatical role , and information status should here corded for each argument position  . 
( d ) The quantity and role constraints are the heuristic principles for information processing  . 
4 . Conclusion hit his paper , we have demonstrated that Chinese narrative discourse also displays Preferred Argument Structure based on the quantity and distribution of lexieal arguments and new referents across grammatical roles  . 
However , the Chinese PAS challenges the universality of the one DuBo is proposed  , because they differ in the distribution of lexical arguments and new referents across grammatical roles  . In other words , the discourse pressure driving the various grammatical patterning in different languages reflects the underlying pragmatic preference of the different groups of language users  . 
From the computational viewpoint , no matter whether PAS is universal or language -specific  , its existence has significant implication to discourse understanding  . On the one hand , PAS can function in a discourse understanding model as a heuristic device to process the information structure of a connected spoken discourse  ; on the other hand , the information status of an argument can be identified by virtue of grammatical analysis since the flow of information has a corresponding grammatical patterning  ,
