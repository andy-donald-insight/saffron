Due to grammatical similarities , even a one-to-one mapping between Korean and Japanese words  ( or morphemes ) can usually result in a high quality Korean-to -Japanese machine translation  . However , multiword translation units ( MWTU ) such as idioms , compound words , etc . , need an n-to-m mapping , and their component words often do not appear adjacently  , resulting in a discontinuous MWTU . During translation , the MWTU should be treated as one lexical item rather than a phrase  . In this paper , we define the types of MWTUs and propose their representation ad recognition method depending on their characteristics in 
Korean-to-Japanese MT system . In an experimental evaluation , the proposed method turned out to be very effective in handling MWTUs  , showing an average recognition accuracy of 98 . 4% and a fast recognition time . 
1 Introduction
As a transfer problem in a machine translation ( MT )  , lexical and structural differences exist between source and target languages  , which requires ln , mn , or n1 mapping strategies for machine translation system  . For such mapping strategies , we need to treat several ( n , or m ) words ( or morphemes ) as a single translation unit . Although some researches ( D . Santos , 1990; Linden E . , 1990; Yoon Sung Hoe , 1992; Ha Gyu Lee , 1994; D . Arnold , 1994) employ the term " idiom " for these units , we prefer MWTU ( MultiWord Translation Unit ) because it is a more general and broader term for MT environment  . 
Up to now , some reseam has focused on recognition and transfer of MWTUs  , although very little research has been undertaken for Korean-to-Japanese machine translation systems  ( Seen-He Kim , 1997) . In previous researches , some tended to simplify the problem by treating only special types of MWTUs  , while others had some recognition errors and took too much recognition time because they did not restric the recognition scope  ( D . Santos , 1990; Yoon Sung
Hee , 1992; Ha Gyu Lee , 1994; Seen-He
Kim , 1997).
For a Korean-to-English MT , Lee and Kim ( Ha Gyu Lee , 1994 ) uses only weak restrictions like adjacent inforlnation for recognition scope  . 
However , their method needs stronger restrictions to resolve recognition errors and to speed up the process  . Although some differences exist depending on which kinds of source and target languages are dealt with  , MWTUs in Korean-to-Japanese MT frequently have their component words close together  , so that one can predic the location of their separated component words  . For this reason , we can enhance the recognition accuracy and time effectively by restricting the recognition scope according to the characteristics of an MWTU rather than taking the whole sentence as the scope  . 
Moreover , the method by Lee and Kim(Ha
Gyu Lee , 1994 ) deals with only surface-level consistency without considering word order because Korean has ahnost free word order  . It is obvious that the method can deal with variable recognition results arc possible wh cn meaning changes according to word order  . Because MWTUs to be treated in Korean-to-Japanese MT have an almost fixed word order sequence  , their meaning may vary if the word order is changed  . In (1) , both sentences have the same lexical words ( or morphemes )  , but while the first sentence must be treated as an MWTU  , the second , which has the different sequence from the first , does not have the meaning of an MWTU . In (1) , the words surrounded with a box are an essential component morpheme for an 

(big )   ( nose )   ( get hurt )  /* ( 1 ) hadabit ~ ) erience */ ( nose )   ( get hurt )   ( big ) /* It is serious ( that I ) go thurt in my nose */ In this paper , to solve the word order problem and thus enhance are cognition accuracy and time for MWTUs  , we fix the word order in an MWTU and define the recognition scope of component words according to their characteristics  . Based on it , then we propose a representation and recognition method of MWTUs for a Korean-to-Japanese MT system  . 
In the rest of this paper , details will be presented about lhese proposed ideas  , log clher with some evalualion results . For representing Korean and Japanese expressions , the 1994-SK(ROK
Ministry of Education ) and the Kunrei
Romanization systems are used respectively.
2 Processing of MWTUs
In developing MT systems , we frequently contact with some differences in wordspacing  , grammar , and so on , between sotuve and target languages . But the method and degree of difficulty of handling them highly depend upon the nature of the source and target hmguage in the MT system  . In this paper , we treat the representation and recognition methods of MWTUs according to their characteristics for only a Korean-to-Japanese MT system  . 
2.1 Types of MWTU
The recall be 11 , lm , n-l , and nm mapping relations of morphemes between source and target language in machine translation  . Due to the grammatical similarities of Korean and
Japanese , Korean-to-Japanese machine translation systems have been developed under the direct MT strategy  , which assumes a 11 mapping relation . But a uniform application of this 11 mapping relation will easily result in an unnatural translation  . 
It is not difficult to handle a 11 and lm mapping relations in Korean-to-Japanese MT system although it uses only direct MT strategy  , because it is easy to recognize only one morpheme in source language  , Korean . It is also due to the fact that Japanese correspondences have characteristics of non -spacing and continuity  , which allows several words to be treated as a single word  . In this reason , we need to consider just types with n-I and nm mapping relations  . Table 1 shows the types of MWTUs to be handled in Korean -to-Japanese MT  . 
The compound words in Table 1 are the units that must be translated into one Japanese morpheme though they are conlpound words ill Korean  . For example , " wo dett peuroses eo " is a Korean compound word which consists of two morphemes " wodeu " and " l  ) euroseseo " , but its Japanese equivalent is only one morpheme , " walmro " . The Korean word ') , eojju-cobel-dal " is also a compound word , made by 2 lexical morphemes " yeoiju " and " be " and 1 functional morpheme " - eo " , but it also corresponds to only one Japanese equivalent morpheme  , " ukagal-u \]" . in these cases , the Korean compound words shoukl be recognized as one unit to be transformed into one Japanese morpheme  . 
We can classify verbal nouns into 2 types according to their Japanes equivalents . Table 2 shows them . If we define a Korean verbal noun as X and its equivalent in Japanese as X '  , and another single word in Japanese as Y , we can describe the two types of relations between Korean and Japanese verbal nouns as below  . 
Although the type 1 satisfies l : l mapping relation , the type 2 does not . So , for the type 2, the verbal noun , X(e . g . , " chuka " ) and " ha\[-da\]"need to be recognized as a single unit to be transformed into a Japanese quivalent  , Y .

Collocation patterns are the units that frequently co-occurr in sentences and affect the semantics of each other  . There are two kinds of collocation patterns . In one , each component morpheme is translated into different equivalents  , such as " dambae\[-reul\]piu\[-&ll ( smoke ) " corresponding to " tabako-osu\[-u \]" , and in the other , all component morphemes must be translated into one Japanese morpheme with an equivalent meaning  , such as " soran\[-eul\]piu\[-da\]" corresponding to " sawa\[-gu\]"  . While the morphemes in the former case have a l-to-1 mapping relation , the morphemes in the latter case have an n-to-1 mapping relation and therefore , must be treated as a single morpheme . 
While some modalitics consist of only one morpheme like "- eot " or "- da "  , there are also some modalities made up of several morphemes like "- neun geotgat "  . Accordingly , the latter must be handled as an MWTU . 
An Idiom is a general idiomatic unit defined in a dictionary  . Generally , since an idiom does not reflect literal meaning itself  , translating their component morphemes individually results in very different meaning  , In this case , it must be treated as a single unit . 
A colloquial idiomatic phrase is also composed of several morphemes  , but it is recognized like a single unit word . For instance , the Korean greeting " cheoeumbe e1 ) -get-seum nida " corresponds to " hazime-masi -le " in Japanese  . In this case , a 1-to-I mapping transformation results in an unnatural translation  . 
Therefore , it also should be recognized as

Moreover , MWTUs can be used for groups of words that can give a more natural translation when they are treated as one unit  . We will call these groups of words semi-words . 
2.2 The Characteristics of MWTUs
To minimize the recognition time and recognition error rate of MWTUs  , we need to represent MWTUs according to their characteristics  . The following shows the characteristics of MWTUs . 
1) Fixed word order
All of the 7 types of MWTUs in Table 1 have a fixed word order sequence , even though Korean and Japanese are known as free word order languages  . Expression such as " keu-nkodachi " and "- neungeotgat " nmst be recognized from thin of MWTUs if the word order sequence has been changed  . This provides a good characteristic for simply representing MWTUs  . 
2 ) Extension by insertion o1' other words For some kinds of MWTUs , it is possible to insert some grammatical morphemes or other words between their component n ~ or plaemes of an MWTU  . "- do " in (2) , "- reul " and " - reulgeu-ege " in ( 3 ) are those cases . 
( go )   ( means )   ( is )  /*  ( l ) cango *//* ( 1 ) can go , too */ .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   ( 3  )   ( a favor )   ( owe ) /* be obliged to */~- reul ~- da /* be obliged to */  , ~- reuleg ~- egg~-da ( he ) /* be obliged to him */ According to this feature  , the relations between immediately located two component morphemes of MWTUs can be classified as follows : A  . tightly connected : the relation that no morpheme can be inserted between them B  . loosely connected : the relation that some morphemes can be inserted between them  . 
BI . Only particles madendings of a word are allowed to be inserted between them  . 
B2 . Any kinds of morphemes can be inserted between them  . 
\[ Figure I\]Relations between two adjacent component morphemes of MWTUs  3  ) Strong cohesion
Although some MWTUs have characteristics of extension by insertion of other words  , component morphemes in an MWTU have strong cohesion  , not only logically but also physically . This means that tile recognition o1' an MWTU is possible by local comparison of its physical ocation  . But it does not imply that the scope is limited in a simple sentence structure  . 
4) The predictable recognition scope of

It is possible to predict tile recognition scope between two adjacent component morphemes of MWTUs  , according to the above characteristics . The scope can be predicted as follows l ' or each type of MWTUs shown in 
Table 1.
Component morphemes of a compound word are corltiguous to the next Olle  , so their scopes are predictable . 
Both verbal nouns and collocation patterns have thel'orm combined with " Noun " and " Verb "  , where other words can be inserted between them . But in the case (51'" Noun+Verb+Verb " , which is the fern1 that another verb is inserted between the noun and verb  , its meaning may be different in that of an MWTU . Sottae scope of the " Verb " can be limited up to the position of the first verb appearing after the " Noun "  , that is , the position where the POS ( part-of speech ) appears . 
Component morphemes of a modality have an especially strong cohesion  . So at most , one particle is often inserted next to the bound noun  . 
From this , we can predict the next component morpheme apart from procomponent at most indistance  2  . 
idioms , colloquial idiomatic phrases and senti-words consist of various colnponenl morphemes  , which results in various scopes for
MWTU recognition . The scopes of each conlpollell tll\]Ol'phellles froulpl * e-colllponellt morphemes can be determined by distance  1  , distance 2 , or infinity . But in l'inite scope can also be limited by the position which the POS of the component morpheme appears  . 
2.3 Representation of MWTU
The representation fan MWTU must be considered in order to enhance recognition accuracy and speed up the process  . Accordingly , in this paper , we propose representation method ( 5 1' MWTUs according to the characteristics mentioned in section  2  . 2 . 
One basic rule for MWTU representation is that an MWTU is composed of only lexical morphemes if possible  , that is , grammatical a word will be extracted in the representation because of the above characteristics which are freely inserted and omitted  . However , grammatical morphemes affecting the meanings of MWTUs must be described  . 
Next , according to the characteristics described in section  2  . 2 , we need to represent recognition scopes between adjacent component morphemes and POS of each component morpheme for the restriction of recognition scope  . 
m , ( POS , , d , 2) m2 ( POS2, d2~) . . . m , ( POS , , d , , m) . . . 
m(POS , , , d , , . , ,+, ) m ~: ith COlnponent morpheme o1' an MWTU
POS ~: POS of m~d ~ . ~+ x : maximum distance from m , to m ~+ ~\ [ Figure 2\] Representation of an MWTUd ~ , ~+ ~ has 4 kinds of values according to Figure 1 . For the case of A , d  ~ , ~+ , is 1 , for the case of B-l , it is 2 , for the case of B2 , it is ~ , mad then for the last component morpheme , it is always 0 because ( n + l ) -th component morpheme doesn't exist . 
The examples of MWTUs described by above representation are shown in Figure  3  .

Additionally , for recognition , we made the first component morpheme of the MWTU have an MWTU field  , which is composed of MWTUs starting from the entry word  . This means that only one access to the dictionary is needed after an MWTU is confirmed  . Figure 4 shows the dictionary structure for an MWTU .

Some rules are required in order to recognize MWTUs represented like those in section  2  . 3 . 
First , the recognition scope of m ~+ ~ after recognizing m ~ is decided by POS ~+  , and d ~ . ~+ cF or restricting the recognition scope maximally while preventing other recognition errors  , we formulated recognition scopes of each component morphemes of an MWTU as follows  . 
RS(RecognitionScope ) = min\[real_dist ~ < , d , + , \] real dist ~+ ~: the distance fi'omln ~ to the i ~ oint -' that the POS of In \[+ ~ appears at first in an input sentence d~~+~: maximum distance from m ~ to in  , + , \[ Figure 5\] Recognition scope In (4) , for an MWTU " ip(N , oo ) nolli(V , O ) , the recognition scope of " nolli " is 3 becaused l , 2 is oo and real_dist , , 2 is 3 , which is fi'om 63 . For an MWTU , "-ji(mC , 2) an ( V , 0) , the recognition scope of " an " is 1 becaused 3 . 2 is 2 and real_dist , , 2 is 1 , which is from 12-11 . Therefore , we can recognize MWTUs by a small comparison .

For instance , the recognition scope of " ji " in an MWTU " sinse  ( N , oo) , ji(V , 0) " was limited by 2 , which is the minimum value between d ~ = ( oo ) and real_ distj . 2(3-1=2) . So it prohibits errors , such as Japanese ( a ) in (5) , occurring when an MWTU is recognized in whole sentence  . 
The second rule states that morphemes inserted between the component morphemes of the recognized MWTU must be rearranged in the following manner :   1  ) ff inserted morphemes are lexical morphemes , they are rearranged to the front of the MWTU . " geureoke ( in that manner ) " in ( 4 ) is such a case . 
2) If they are grammatical morphemes , they are ignored when they directly follow any component of the MWTU  , and they are transl~rred to the front of the MWTU together with the inserted lexieal morphemes when thcy follow any inserted lexical morphemes  . In (4), "- eul " is the former case . If any grammatical morpheme such as "- do " or "- ha " is attached after " geureoke "  , it will be the latter case . 
Third , if a morpheme is the common subset of the two MWTUs  , we select the one such that its first component morpheme locates in the preposition  . This rule is used to reduce the recognition time by skipping morphemes which are subsets of the pre-confirmed MWTUs Fourth  , we selec the superset of MWTU in case that two or more MWTUs starting from a same morpheme are recognized and one is the superset of the others  . For " example , let us consider two MWTUs : ' ~ iamsi-man-yo ( wait a moment ) " and ' i jamsi-man ( for a little while ) " , ff " , jamsi-man-yo " is recognized , ' ~ iamsi-man " can also be recognized and ' ~ amsi-man-yo " is the supcrset of " jamsi- man "  . In this case , we selec the supersct , ' ~ antsi-man-yo " . 
549 3 Evaluation
To demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed method  , we applied it to a Korean-to-Japanese machine translation system  ( COBALT-K/J )  , and evaluated its recognition accuracy and recognition time  . COBALT-K/J consists of about 150 , 000 general purpose words and 7 , 500 MWTUs . For the test corpus , we arbitrary extracted 2 , 808 sentences from a 10 million word corpus , the KIBS ( Korean Information Base System ) . MWTUs registered in the dictionary appeared 3 , 647 times in them . 
Table 3 shows the evaluation results classified by the types of MWTUs  .

Nevertheless , 98 . 4% of the test samples were recognized correctly . In order to recognize an MWTU , it needed only 1 . 0 3 comparisons per each component morpheme of the MWTU on the average  . This shows the effectiveness and the speed of our proposed method for treating 
MWTUs in Korean-to-Japanese MT.

In this paper , we classified the different kinds o1' MWTUs and proposed a representation and recognition method for them in a 
Korean-to-Japanese MT.
MWTUs in Korean-to-Japanese MT have the characteristics of fixed word order  , strong cohesion , predictable scope of its component morphemes , extension by other words , etc . 
Accordingly , we enhanced accuracy and recognition time by representing and recognizing MWTUs according to their characteristics  . 
In our experiment , 98 . 4% of the test samples were recognized correctly , which shows the effectiveness of our proposed method  . In future work , we will research in more strict recognition restrictions and plan to extract 
MWTUs from a corpus automatically.
