In this section , centering is cxtcndc'd to handle mult , il ) IcZI~I!O-I ) I'O IIOIII lS~~llldl , hcll\['url , here xl , cn d0 d to handle over ( , pronouns . Finally , the ordering ; ot'm>t . ities for showing the degree of salience is & mcril  ) ed . 
1151 2.1 Zero-Pronouns
In Kameyama's account , only one zero-pronoun encodes the Cb , and any otl ~ erzero-pronouns become Cfs , just as if they had been overtly expressed in the sentence  . In other words , when there are multiple zero-pronouns , only one of the zero-pronouns has any significance  , and ally other zero-pronoun might as well have been overtly expressed  . 
But , because entities become zero-pronouns in order to avoid unnaturalness due to redundancy  , zero-pronouns can be said to be salient enough to be understood without being overt  . Iu effect , this means that a greater amount of attention is placed on them than entities that were overtly expressed  . This is shown through an example . 
Taking her approach , some simple extensions are made to see how well the ordering of entities in centering would work for multiple zero-pronouns  . First , the antecedent for the Cb-eueoding zero-pronoun is chosen  . a shown in \[ Kameyama85\] . Basically , this consists of choosing the entity with the highest degree of salience in the previous sentence  . Then , the next most salient zero-pronoun according to the ordering of degrees of salience given in the previous section is considered  . The antecedent for this zero-pronoun is the most salient entity fi'om the previous sentence which will not contradict any possible constraints  . At this point , we only consider semantic constraints for excluding such sentences as " The deskate fish " and contra-index constraints for excluding such sentences as " Jackate Jack  . " Any other zero-pronouns are handled intile same manner  . For example , the following discourse is examined l :
Example 1: ( 1 ) Tarowa Jirotoshokujichuu deatta . 
Taro Top/Subairo with meal during was
Tarowash . avin 9 a meal wilh . airo.
Cb :--, Cf:Taro > . ire(2) @ Saburo we mikaketa . 
SubSaburoObj saw(Taw ) saw SabTtro.
Cb : Taro , Cf:Saburo(3) ~? airon is houkaishita . 
SubObjJir oObj2 introduced ( Taro ) introduced ( 5' aburo ) to Jiro . 
(4) ? q'Shokujin is a sotta.
SubObj meal Obj2 invited(Taw ) invited(Sal , uro ) to lheme al . 
1"?5" denotes zero-pronouns , and Top , Sub , Obj , Obj2 de ~ notes Topic , Subject , Object , and Object2 , respectively . 
In sentence (1) , tile Cfs are ordered as Taro > Jiro , since Topic is the most salient entity . In sentence (2) , the entity with the highest degree of salience fi 'o  , n the previous sentence ( Taro ) is chosen a stile zero-pronoun's antecedent , and becomes the Cb , with Saburo becoming a Cf . Intile third sentence , after Taro is chosen as the subject of the sentence  , since there is only Saburo left , , Saburo becomes the antecedent of tile object zero-pronoun  , assuming that there is some sort of knowledge preventing Taro from becoming the object  . 
After sentence (3) , the ordering of noun phrases would be as follows : Taro  ( Cb ) > Jiro ( Cf-Obj2 ) = Saburo ( Cf-Ohj ) This means that sentence ( 4 ) is ambiguous , having tile following possible interpretations : ( a ) Taroinvited Jiroto the meal . 
( b ) Taroinvited Saburot other neal.
But , the preferred meaning is ( b) . So , this would mean that the ordering should be as follows: 
Taro > Eaburo > Jiro
This example shows that when trying to interpret more than one zero-pronoun  , the ordering of noun phrases according to Kameyama's acconnt may not be optimal  . Of course , this can be rectified by changing the ordering of the degree of salience so that Object is higher than  Object2  , and as noted later in the paper this will actually take place  . But , suppose sentence ( 3 ) in Example 2 is replaced with the following sentence : ( 3' ) q5'-bJi rowes houkaishita . 
SubObj2air oObj introduced(T a , ,) i,, . t,~od,,ce~ai,'o(toS,,b , ,,' o) . 
Even in this case , the interpretation of sentence ( 4 ) would not change 2 . So , the ordering of zero-pronoun not being optimal , i . e . that zero-pronouns are more likely to become zero -pronouns again than overt noun phrases  , would seeln to be the more logical choice . 
So , we propose that " entities that have become zero -pronouns are more centered intile discourse than those that have been overtly expressed  . " Therefore , tile centering model has been extended to tile following two lists to handle entities  ( noun phrases ) that appear in a sentence : ~ Althoug bit should be noted that it doesn't seem to be  , as strongly preferred as before .

(2) Possible Center List ; ? .   . Entities in a sentence . 
that were overtly exl ) ressed.
2.2 Pronouns
In Japanese , both overt and elided t ) ronondnal forms exist . The elided l ) rOl , Ominal for l ' Ll ( zero-pronoun ) was discussed in the previous subsection . 
In this subsection , we will show how pronouns are handled within tile proposed n lode l  .

CL:Taro , PCI , : Jiro > llauako (4) ( l~?l ) Sukinaa to dcarl ,  . 
SubObj like is ('/'., ', ,) li~:~.,~(Ha , , ~ o).
If this example is interl ) reted with t it (' , antecedent of kanojo ( her ) in sentence ( 3 ) in the Possible (  . : eat-terList , then tile interpretation would be ' Tatro likes 3iro   . '\ [ n order to obtain the preferred interpret at ion  , the ordering of noun phrases should be as follows: 
Taro > llauako > . lifo'l'h is example shows that pronoul , s are not n ( ~ ccs-sadly at the same level as with other overt noun phrases  . Ill other words , proll ouns a treat l . at . level of attention higher than ' ordinary ' noun phrases  . This is especially true when considering tile fact that pro-ll IIS are used to preven\[  ; nnl/aturathlessdllcl . ore dundancy , just as zero-prononi is are used . 
a ' CL's trums for Center1, is t . , all d ') ('1,' stands for Possible
Center Lisl , .
So , we propose that pronouns be interl ) reted at the same level as zero-pronouns as follows: 
C(mter List Model
The entities in a sentencellelong to one of tile t bllowing two lists :  ( 1 ) Ceilte F List .   .   . l '; ntities that have .

(2) Possible Center List .   .   . Entities that were overtly expressed but ~ tre not in the Center List  . 
Entities ill the Centerl , ist are more salient than those in the l ) ossihle Center List , with tile exception of '\[' opic . 
The except km will be touched nllon in the next sub-  . 

2.3 Ordering by Salience
Next comes the problenl of ordering witl , in the Centerl , ist and the Possible Center List . in other words , the difference in salience between pronouns ( zero and ow ; rt ) and ' ordinary ' noun phrases is shown by the Center List and the Possible Center last  . l , 'ntities in the Center List arelnores Mient than those in the Possible Center List  . But , what about t , tl < " difference ills alie . nce within each list ? In our model , the ordering is as follows : ' l'opic > Subject > Object >  Object2 > Others > Subject/Ol~ject/Ol~ject2 of subordinate clause > Othersill Sllb or dill ~ Jt ; (! clause The tirst line shows tile ordering of grammatical functions of the main verh  . This line is basically the same as l ( a meyama's ordering , except that Object is deemed to be more salient than  Object2  . This was because , after making some prelhninary evaluations of our model  , Object was Rmnd to have at slightly higher degree of salience than  Object2  . 
The following two lines are for ally entities that at pl  ) car in subordinate ( : l~mses . '\[' here doesn't seem to be at clearcut difference between the Subject  , Object , and Obje . ct2 of subordinatte clauses , so they are Ilcmdled at the same level . The difference between the lnain clause and any sul  ) ordinate clauses captures the intuition that ent it ies in the main chmse are  . more s~dient hant hose in subordinate ones . 
There is one exception to the Center List Model.
It is tile salience of the Topic in the Possible Center ' Fopie is special in that the sentence contains information about the entity corresponding to the Topic  . 
In other words , the sentence is usually about the 3bpicalized entity . So , it was placed at . the same level as the Object in the Center List . 
3 Experiment and Discussion
An experiment was done to show the effectiveness of the Centerlast Model in interpreting pronouns and zero-pronouns  . A total of 160 sentences from the following four discourses were used : ?" Ushikata To Yainanba "\[ Tsul  ) ota 75\] ( Japanese folklore-70 sentences ) ?" Madogi wa No Totto-clmn "\ [ Kuroyanagi81\] ( Story - - - 51 sentences ) ?" Yasei Doubutsu ' . I'o Tomoni " ( Newspaper col-
Hllln ) -" Baison "\[ Obara 91\] ( 15 sentences ) -" h'ie Wani "\[ Obara 92\] ( 24 sentences ) This section will first describe the simple imple -nlentation used in the experiment  . Then , it is evaluated ( Table 1) , followed by a e o n l l , a . rison ( Table 2) with Kameyama's method . 
3.1 Implementation
The implementation is kept simple to demonstrate the eft'eel of the CenterList  . Semantic on straints on the type of entity that a ( zero ) pronoun may refer to -- for example , the Subject of ' eat ' must be animate- , and contra-index constraints for restricting combinations of eo referring entities within a sentence-for example  , tile Subject and Object of ' eat . ' cannot be the same entity-are used . In add Mon , a constraint concerning tire subject and identification  4 of Cbs in adjacent sentence siused\[Kameyama 86\]  , except it applies to each entity in the Center List of adjacent sentences as follows : Two zero -pronouns that appear ill the Cell-ter List of adjacent sentences should share one of the following properties  ( in descending order of pret ? rence ) :  ( l ) id ' entitication and subject , (2) identification only , (3) subject only , (4) non-identification and not > subject . 
41 ( a meym na's terminology for l~mpathy\[Kuno78\] . It shows the perspective from which an event is described  . 
Of course , tire Center List and the Possible Center List by themselves will not be able to handle antecedents that arc not in the previous sentence  . In order to solve this problem , an adhoc approach was taken by adding the following two lists : ? Past Center List  . . . Entities that have previously been a zero-pronoun or an overt pronoun  , but do not appear in the current sentence . 
? Noun List . . . Entities that have never been a zero-pronoun or an overt pronoun  . 
In order to avoid combinatorial explosion , the entities that are held in these two lists are limited to those which appear in the previous three sentences  . 
Each entity in the four lists is assigned a score to show its degree of salience  . In other words , t be score shows the possibility of be confing a zero  ( or overt ) pronoun in the next sentence . 
After morphological nd syntactic analysis , the interpretation process is basically carried out as follows:  ( 1 ) Using the semantic constraints , possible antecedents for pronouns and zero q ) ronouns are found from the Center List , Possible Center List , Past Center last , and Nolln List . 
(2) Combinations of possible antecedents are made.
(3) Contra-index constraints are applied.
(4 ) Each combination is given a score as follows: ( 4 . l ) Compute the sum of the scores that each possible antecedent was given  . 
(4 . 2 ) Give bonus scores according to the subject and identification constraint  . 
(5 ) The combination with the highest score is ch > sell as the combination with the inost probable antecedents  . 
(6) The Center List , Possible Center List , etc . are updated . 
3.2 Evaluation
Table 1 shows our results . Considering tile fact that t , he Center List Model itself handles only pro-not lns ~ tndgero-pronollns whose ~ tnteeedents are found one sentence back  , it shows promise since a very simple fi'a mework is enough to achieve  76% accuracy . Also , thoughtile number of pronouns was small , tile percentage of correct interpretations was

Kameyama's method.
4 Conclusion
In this paper , centering was extended to better interpret pronoulrs and zero-pronouns  . It , extended the centering model to have two lists . The Center List holds entities that ' appeared ' in the sentence as either an overt pronoun or a zero-pronoun  . The Possible Center List holds entities that overtly appeared in the sentence  , excluding overt pronouns . 
A very simple implementation showed that 76% of pronouns and zero-pronouns could be interpreted  . 
'\[' he percentage goes up to 81% when considering only those whose antecedents are one sentence back  . 
But , as the figures indicate , a more global framework , such as one descrihed in \[ Grosz86\] , is needed .
