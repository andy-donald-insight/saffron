One of the ways to achieve a good translation of verbal forms is the morphosp ~ tactic approach  , which consists in a function pairing the different morphological tenses that occur in a given language with the tenses of the other language  . Complicated rules must be established to calculate the right pair for an expression  , because of the amount of discrepancies that differmnt languages show with respect to each other  . 
The way we have chosen to deal with this problem is  , conversely , the projection of the different values coming from verbs  ( type , processivity , morf tense , morf aspect , mood require ~ nent ) , from adverbs , prepositional phrases and temporal N~S(deixis , espect , iteration ) , and from subordinate conjunctions ( aspect , mood requirement ) . 
All this information permits to obtain a final value for aspect  . ~nd tense for the whole sentence , which later on i8 percolated , not only to the verb node , but also to the the rest of elements conveying information  . 
Our proposal relies on the fact that tense/aspect calculation is relevant not only for a good translation of verbs  , but also for a good translation of adverbs , PPs , temporal I ~ . ~ and conjunctions , as we have intended to demonstrat ~~ n this paper  . 
L Introduction '1~li ~ article deals with a methodology to achieve the right t~s~lsiation of temporal expressions by giving account of the temporal reference and temporal relations in/between sentences  . The task to accomplish is to translates y , % t actic marks into semantic values that decide / reflect the aspect nal value of the sentences  . 
F o3:'   o6r treatment of time and aspect we draw on the work of Eamp  \[1979\] and Partee \[1984\] who have argued for taking statos and events as primitives and relations of precedanco ~ md overlapping between them  . The ordering relation ~ t ~ n events is crucial for deciding about the aspect of the sentences involved  . 
~hn presemt proposal presumes an analysis end a geme ~ ationt ! omponent that deliver a set of S -trees whose leaves cor ~: espond to words  . The preterminals have morpbo synta?:tic and ~ elational information  . As usual , features ar ~ J percolated and nodes get features assigned  . 
~ he time/aspectual problem is dealt with under the perspect ? ~* of MT with the aim of sketching a system that can be i ~ lemented independently of the particular formalisms of different MT -systems  . 
To outline a general model for the time/aspect calculation in MT we subsume a system with PSG rules that obtain some sentence structure with no regard to a specific grammar type  ; it could be an augmented PSG , as in METAL , or some kind of deep syntactic structure , as it is the case in

The problem is the wellknown fact that translations of temporal expressions in NL does not involve a simple mapping of tenses and adverbials  . We could just compare Spanish , rich ill aspect and tenses vs . German or English . 
That is , a MT dealing with Germanic and Romance languages is concerned with different parameters for each language  ; the whole practice in MT systems is to translate morphological tenses  , and syntactical values into reference times that include events or stutes \[ Partee  1984\]  . 
Once the set of factors and values relevant for the specification oi ! time  , aspect , and mood has been defined , a calculation or unification in the form of rules fixes the values that must be generated in the target language  . Such a system must " preserve " the same " semantic interpretation " for different language realisations  , in order to be able to generate the right morphological tenses and periphrasis from language to language  . 
2. Aktionsart
Vendler's definition of Aktionsart \[1967\] relies on a classification of verbs into sentences  . However , we start from verb primitives that are categorized  ( Verb Type ) into :- stative : to be in love , stand , know . .
-dynamic : w ~ ite , arrive , love , ..
and we take an additional feature " Processive " to mark the differences between activities vs  . accomplishment , ach ? evement or quality/state vs . stance ( R . Quirk 1985) . 
The inherent type of these verb primitives is overridden during  , the analysis by the morphological tense and by the syntactic functions  , so that we finally obtain a-write ( ancribir ) : VT = activity , Proc--yes ( a durative verb ) -send ( enviar ) : ~: activity , Proc--no ( a punctual verb ) The original aktions art of the verb , durative activit , y becomes an accomplishment in the sentence " I wrote a letter "  , In Spanish this information must be marked in order to choose the right past form  . 
l\[escribio\[unacaxta\]\]-->VT=activity & proc--no ~-> tense = In definite Past\[escrib ~ a\] --> AKT = activity ~-> tense=Imperfect  3  . Deix is The calculation of the time value , which is always expressed as a deictic value relating the speech time to the reference time  , is obtained out of the deictic values of the morphological tenses together with the adverbials present in the sentence  . For instance , the Spanish present tense has the value \[ simultaneous and posterior \]  . If ital ~ ears with a posterior adverbial , the final value is posterior . 
The deix is assigment in Spanish is reflected in table i  . The left side is the assigmant in contexts with no temporal transposition  ; the right side shows the assigmant for tense transposition  . The context for tense transposition is given for knowledge and diction verbs  .

Temporal modifiers can belong to different classes  :   1 -Adverbs : in this case the deictic value comes from the dictionary  2 - PP : the deictic value comes fr ~ the
Preposition 3 -l ~: The deict invalue is the result of two factors : a \] the demo strativasend b  ) the temporal type of the singular noun ~' s when temporal desiguator a have the Deixia \ [ ant  , post\] . When they appea ~ with a plural definite a ~ ticle , this is an operator that overrides the original deixi8 values end yields the iterativa aspect . 
438 i . e . : " ellunes "\[ past , ante\](="on monday "\] ve . " loslunes " liter ( on mondays ) The delx is feature is the dianri ~ Linatlng factor to get the right transfer for " lunes "  . 
4 - Subordinate clauses : the deictic value of this adverbials is a calculus of the deictic value of the conjunction  ( if present )  , and that of the tense and of the mood , if present . 
There are two possible cases depending on the source language  ( Germanic or Romance )  . For the first case , the axpectual value of the conjunction end the temporal value of the main clause select the mood of the subordinate clause  . The deini8 value of the main clause i8 copied onto the subordinate conjunction ; this value decides about the 8ubjuntive ~squir ~ ent of the conjunction . Let's take the conjunction " till " ( Eng . )," his"(Ge ~ . )," bestsque "( Spa, . ) that has no deictic value . If the main clause is in future , " till " gets the deix is " post " , if it iS past than it ' gets accordingly the deixis " ante "  . 
The interesting fact is that , according to the obtained deictic value the conjunct im ~  , selects the subjunctive requirement . When the conduction has assigned in the lexicon the com ~ it unt of subjunctive requirement  , this value is the most relevant . For example: , ~I will\[pct\] , work , t~ll\[post\]"youcome"Traba\]ar~\[post\] , hastaque\[deixis--~ost\]vengas"==>\[aubre ~es\]"E rarbeitete\[ante\]hls\[ante\]mr kam ""  Trabaj6 \[ante\]hastaque\[de~xis=ante\] lleg6\[ante \]" Taere fo ~ e the following general rule can be fomulated : 
Source Conjunction\[poSt\]=>
Tenge ~ Con~nction\[subr ~\]
Again the deLv/s value also selects the right transfer of the conjunction  . Here some examples for Spanish end German : .  ,  .   .  ?  .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .  , , ? ,0 ,  .   .   .  ? ?  .   .   .   .   .   .

The relevance of the presence/absence of the progresaivity can be shown when we translate into Greek  . In this language the same aspect value generates different tenses according to presence or absence of progressivity  . 
For instance , if aspect i8 retrospective and there is progressivity then the corresponding tense is Imperfect  , hut if there is no presence of progressivity the corresponding tense for this aspect is Present perfect  . 
The morphological tenses also imply monoling nal aspectual assignments  . Here we will follow the proposal of F . vanE~de . According to it , each language has a different distribution of aspectual features in tenses  . However , here again we prefer to split up themo ~ hological values according to two attributes : formend pro ~fesivily form  . 
4.2 A speetual value of adverbials
Adverbs as well as prepositions and conjunot ? on s have in the lexicon an aspectual value assig ~ ent  . Temporal NP's as adverbials get the aspectual assigment from their dete ~ inents or quantifiers  . Bare plurals or distributive quantifier a assign the value \[ iterativity \]  , while All-cuantifier8 furnish the NP with durativity , expressed in some languages as progressivity . 
"E Ea ~ be itet denganzen Tag . . . . . Estatraba jando to doeld la For instance , iterativity must be delivered from the source language in order to generate the right tense even for punctual verbs  , e . g . : " und ~ a I enviof lores a Carmen "=" he once sent flowers to Carmen " vs  . 
" envlabaceded ~ a flore8 a Carmen "= " hesent to Carmenf lowers everyday " Deterniners/quentifiers have a spentual values as : un\[parr\]  ; cede\[iter\] ; to daa\[iter ) ; to do/a\[dur\]So the transfer of " d~a " is " once " if we are concerned with a perfeative HP -adverbial  . However the transfer of " d/a " e8 ' day ' when the a speetual calculus has furnished the NP with the feature \[ dnr\]or liter\]  . 
In PP ' a the final aspectual value is the result of the calculus of the aspect value of the preposition together with the daix is of the adverbial  . For instance , the ~ undary preposition " deeds " since with anterior adverbials yields a final terminative aspect  , but with a posterior adverbial , or even with a anterior adverbial but together with another boundary expression  ( the final Point of the temporal ? t yields a perfective aspect  . Examples : " dasdae . yer\[ente . \]trabajaaq . ~  .   .   .   .   . > teminati ~" deariea ~ or at raDajarden EUROTRA "   . . . . > perfective \[ perf \] \[ limitl--term \] \[ limit  2--perf \] The resulting aspect value of this calculus mus the attached to the preposition or adverb  ( overriding ) the old values in order to get the right transfer . 

en\[perf . \]--> in for\[perf . \]--> enfor\[dur . \]--> durante In subordinate clauses the process is the same  . As we have seen above the deixis of the calculus of the main clause must be attached to the conjunction  . Thus , the calculus of the aspect of the main clause must be furnished to the conjunction in order to be able to get the right transfer of the conjunction and also for generating the right tense in the subordinate clause  . 
Another important factor in the calculus of the aspect is the syntactic type of the constituents in the sentences  . 
These determine the aspectual properties ( Dowry ) . To illustrate it we take the examples of Dowry ( 1986 ) " John walked "-- Juan pase aba\[activity\]" John walked to the station " -- rue ? la esteciotn\[achievment \]" John walked a mile " -- and uvouna mille\[accomplishment\]As we can appreciate  , the Spanish sentences have a different lexical verb form for each of these aspectual differences  . Up to now METAL have different transfers according to the different verb frames  . Eurotra-Germany proposes to disambiguate in the Interface Structure by means of semantic feature bundles  . Besides the constituency factors of the syntax , another important fact is the presence/absence of bare plurals for the objects : " lleva escribiando novel astresa ~ os "--" she has bean writing novels for  3 Years " " sieschreibt Romanese it 3 Jahren " vs . 
" He wrote a novel " --" escribi ~ unanovela"\[ Past ~ perfeotive \] " He wrote novels " - - - " escribla novel as "\[ Past  , durative \] That means that the original verb value for prooes sivity is cverriden according to the NP's that go with the verb  . NP's with quantifiers assign the aspantual values so that punctual verbs express processes  , or vice versa . 
5. Process for the calculus
The calculus of time and aspect can be implemented either as :- a unification of features together with filters that catch or kill complex cases  .   ( EUROTRA ) -an assigment table gathering the possible TI ~ and ASPECT configurations  , and another table yielding the TENSE corresponding to each of the TIME/ASPECT configurations for the right target language generation  . 
S\[deixis , aspect\]
Verb-qro ~~// ~ adverbials
Sty "" -/ AUX deixis , aspect , subj-requirament
Verb type deixis
Processivity aspect
Sub . Requir . progressivity
The calculation process delivers a final value as a result which must be percolated to the S node  . This process has the characteristic of a functional composition  , provided that the different values can be considered as operators applied in a hierarchical order  . The dominant value is the adverbial . 
\[ Adv . ( post)\[V ( simul , post)\]\]--->S(post)\[Adv . ( term )\[ V(perf , dur ) \]\]---> S ( term ) The calculus provides a value for S , and S-subclauses , but also for all the temporals implied so that they can be properly translated into morphological values  , or into lexicalized forms . 
7. Summary
In NL processing the calculus of Time and Aspect is a complext hing where almost all elements of the sentence are concerned  . The dynamics of the aspect and deixis in Natural Language can be captured in the framework of a calculus of these  . Same tables in this article give acquitance of this process  . The originality of our proposal relies on the following aspects : - Unicity of criteria  ( the same features for all temporal categories ) -Uminity of adverbial types ( the same treatment for subordinated temporal clauses  , for adverbs and PP's . 
-A strong interrelation of the aspectual modal and deictic values in the constituents of the sentence  .
