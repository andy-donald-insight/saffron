1 Introduction
The limited capacity of working memory is intrinsic to human sentence processing  , and therefore must be addressed by any theory of human sentence processing  . I assume that the amount of shortterm memory that is necessary at any stage in the parsing process is determined by the syntactic  , semantic and pragmatic properties of the structure  ( s ) that have been built up to that point in the parse  . A sentence becomes unacceptable for processing reasons if the combination of these properties produces too great aload for the working memory capacity  ( cf . 
Fr~ier (1985) , Gibson ( 1987 ) ):  ( 1 ) tl~Aixi > Ki = I where : K is the maximum allowable processing load  ( in processing load units or PLUs )  , x ~ is the number of PLUs associated with property i  , n is the number of properties , Ai is the number of times property i appears in the structure in question  . 
Furthermore , I hypothesize that the human pat's cr prefers one structure over another when the processing load  ( in PLUs ) associated with one structure is markedly lower than the load associated with another  . That is , I hypothesize there exists some arithmetic preference quantity P  , corresponding to a processing load difference , such that if the processing loads associated with two representations differ by P  , then only the representation associated with the smaller of tile two loads survives  . Given the existence of a preference quantity P , it is easy to account for garden-path effects and preferred readings of ambiguous sentences  . Both effects occur because of a local ambiguity which is resolved in favor of one reading  . Given two representations for the same input string that differ in processing load by at least P  , only the less expensive structure will be maintained  . If that sU ' ucture is not com-p , q tible with the rest of the sentence and the discarded structure is part of a successful parse of the sentence  , a garden-path effect results . If the parse is suce essful , but the discarded structure is compatible with anothe reading for the sentence  , then only a preferred reading for the sentence has been calculated  ( cf . Gibson (1987) , Gibson & Clark (1987) , Clark & Gibson (1988)) .   1 Thus if we know 1 An alternative to the preference constraint presented here is the serial hypothesis  , which allows at most one representation for the input string at any stage in the parse  ( see , for example , Frazier & Fodor (1978) , Frazier (1979) , Marcus (1980) , Berwick & Weinberg (1984) , and Pritchett (1988)) . There is a longstanding debate in the psycholinguistic literature as to whether or not more than one representation for an input can be maintained in parallel  . It turns out that the parallel view appears to handle some kinds of data more directly than the serial view  , where one reading of a ( temporarily ) ambiguou sentence becomes the strongly preferred reading  , we cm~write , an inequality associated with this preference : ( 2 ) ? teli=1i=1 where:
P is the preference factor ( in PLUs ) , xi is the number of PLUs associated with property i  , n is the number of properties , Ai is the number of times property i appea Js in the unpreferred structure  , Bi is the number of times property i appears in the preferred structure  . 
In this paper I will concentrate on syntactic properties : z in particular  , I present two properties based on the 0-Criterion and Projection Principle from Government and Binding Theory  ( Chomsky ( 1981 ) ) . 3 Once these properties are , associated with processing loads , they can predict a large array of garden-path effects  . Furthermore , it is demonstrate xl that these properties also make desirable crosslinguistic predictions with respectoun acceptabil-ity due to memory capacity overload  . 
The organization of this paper is given as follows  . Section 2 describes thes ~ ucture of the underlying parser that is  , assumed . Section 3 includes the proposed syntactic properties . Section 4 examines a number of locally ambiguou sentences , including some garden-paths , with respect to these properties . Section 5 explores a number of acceptable and unacceptable sentences and demonstrates that the properties proposed in Section  3 make the right predictions with respect to processing over ? load  . Furthermore , it is demonstrated in this section that these propertie seem to make the right predictions cross--linguistically  . Some conclusion sate given in the final section .   4 keeping in mind that the data are often controversial  . See , for example , Kurtzman ( 1985 ) or Gorrell ( 1987 ) for a history of the debate along with evidence in support of the parallel hypothesis  . 
Note in particular that data normally taken to be support for the serial hypothesis nclude garden -path effects and the existence of preferred readings of ambiguous input  . However , as noted above , limiting the number of allowable representations is only one way of constraining parallelism so that theseffects are also easily accounted for in a parallel framework  . 
/Note that I assume that there also exist semantic and pragmatic properties which are associated with significant proccs singloads  . 
S in another syntactic theory , similar properties may be obtained from the principles that correspond to the  0-Criterion and Projection Principle in that theory . For example , the completeness and coherence conditions of Lexieal Functional Grammar  ( Bresnan ( 1982 ) ) would derive properties imilar to those derived from the  0-Criterion and Projection Principle . The same empirical effect should result from these two sets of properties  . 
4 This paper extends work reported in Gibson ( 1990 ) by ap-114   1   2 The Underlying Parse ~- ~ The parser to which the memory limitation constraints apply must construct representations i such a way so that incomplete input will be associated with structure  . 
Furthermore , the parsing algorithm must , in principle , allow more than one structure to ran input string  , so that the general constraints described in the previousection may apply to restric the possibilities  . The parsing model that I will assume is an extension of the model described in  ( Clark & Gibson ( 1988 ) ) . When a word is input to this model , representations for each of its lexical entries are built and placed in the buffer  , a one cell data structure that holds a set of tree structures  . The parsing model contains a secon data structure  , the stack-set , which contains a set of stacks of buffer cells . The parser builds trees in parallel based on possible attachments made between the buffer and the top of each stack in the stack-set  . The buffer and stack-set are formally defined in ( 3 ) and ( 4 )  . 
(3) A buffer cell is a set of structures St , $2, . . . , S ,   , where each Si represent she same segment of the input string  . The buffer contains one buffer cell . 
(4 ) The stack-set is a set of stacks of buffer cells , where each stack represent she same segment of the input string :  ( St , ~ , t , Sl , t , 2 ,  . . . , & , l, . , , , , , , , Sl , ral , Sl , mt , 2, . . . Sl , ml , n , ~, 1)i " . 
  . . . , s . ,, . ., . ., . .  )  where : p is the number of stacks ; mi is the number of buffer ceils in stack i ; and nld is the number of tree structures in the jth buffer cell of stack i  . 
The motivation for these data structures i given by the desire for a completely unconstrained parsing algorithm upon which constraints may be placed  . This algorithm should allow all possible parser operations to occur at each parse state  . There are only two parser operations : attaching a node to another node and pushing a buffer cell onto a stack  . In order to allow both of these operations to be performed in parallel  , it is necessary to have the given data structures : the buffer and the stack-set  . 
2.1 Node Attachment
I assume a hypothesis-driven node projection algorithm of the following form  . In order to satisfy X Theory ( Jackendoff (1977) , Chomsky (1986b )) , a maximal projection is constructed for each of a word's lexical entries when that word is input  . For each of these structures , the lexical requirements and category of the structure cause stile local prediction to the right of further categories  . These predicted structures are called hypothesized nodes or H-nodes  . All other structures are called confirmed nodes or C-nodes  . For example , when the noun dog is input , a confirmed noun phrase and a h~pothesized clausal phrase are among the structures built : ~ plying the methodology described here to the Projection Principle as well as the  0-Criterion   . While the effects reported in the curlier paper still hold  , many additional results are obtained and reported here  , 5A noun phrase is projected to an H~node clausal ( or predb cate ) phrase since nouns may be the subjects of predicates  . 
(5) ao\[NV\[te,IN dog\]\]1b . \[ xv,~\[tee ~,\[ tedog\]\]\][x ~\[ X,~ . ~ e\]\]\] Node attachment in this framework consists of matching hypothesized nodes on top of a stack in the stack-set against nodes in the buffer  . If the features of two such nodes are compatible , then an attachment t~esplace , the result being the unification of the stack and buffer nodes  . 
Since attachment always involves matching an It -node  , ? all obligatory arguments are projected as H -nodes  . 
3 Dynamic App l i ca t ion o f the 0 -Criterion and Projection Principle Following much current work in syntactic theory  , I assume that the grammar consists of a set of environments where properties such as thematic role and Case may be assigned  , along with a set of filters , each of which rules out representations lacking a necessary property  . This approach to syntactic theory has been labeled the Principles and Parameters Approach  ( PPA )   ( Chomsky ( 1986a ) ) . 
The particular syntactic theory that I will assume is known as Government and Binding theory  ( see Chomsky ,  (1981 , 1986 a , 1986b ) along with the references cited in each ) , although the methodology of this work will apply to any syntactic theory of this form  . 
A filter-based syntactic theory presents an obvious set of candidate  . s for load-bearing structural properties : the set of local violations of all syntactic filters  . That is , given a constraint-based syntactic theory , it is reasonable to assume that there is a processing load associated with the local violation of each syntactic filter  . In particular , I will consider the 0-Criterion and Projection Principle from Government and Binding Theory with respect to a theory of processing  . These principles are given in ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) :  ( 6 ) The Projection Principle : Lexieal requirements must be satisfied at all levels of representation  . ( paraphrased from Chomsky (1981) p . 
29).6 (7) The 0-Criterion:
Each argument bears one and only one 0-role ( thematic role ) and each 0-role is assigned to one and only one argument ( Chomsky ( 1981 ) p .  36) . 
Note that the second part of the 0-Criterion -that each 0-role be assigned-Iollows from the Projection Principle  . 
Thus the 0-Criterion that I will assume consists only of the first clause of  ( 7 ) :  ( 8 ) The 0-Criterion ( simplified ) : Each argument bears one and only one 0-role . 
" file dynamically applied 0-Criterion can be stated as the following processing property :  ( 9 ) The Property of Thematic Reception ( ~I'R ) : Associate aload of x'cn PLUs of short term memory to each constituent that is in a position that can receive a thematic role in some coexisting structure  , but whose 0-assigner is not unambiguously identifiable in the structure in question  . 
6Government and Binding Theory assumes tile existcnce of a number of levels of representation  , I assume that he level most relevant to parsing is surface structure or S  . .slructure . Thus the Projection F ' rinciple applied to S -structure dictates flint lexical requiremenks be satisfied at that level  . 

The dynamically applied Projection Principle gives a similar property  . This property is stated in terms of thematic elements  . Following early work in linguistic theory , I distinguish two kinds of categories : functional categories and thematic or content categories  ( see , for example , Fukui and Speas ( 1986 ) and Abney ( 1987 ) and the references cited in each )  . Thematicategories include nouns , verbs , adjectives and prepositions ; functional categories include determiners , complementizers , and inflection markers . I hypothesiz ~ that thematic elements are more visible to the parser than their functional counterparts  . This assumption is made explicit in the Property of Lexical Requirement  , the dynamic version of the Projection Principle :   ( 10 ) The Property of Lexical Requirement ( PLR ) : Associate aload of xt ~ PLUs of short term memory to each lexical requirement that is satisfied by a hypothesized constituent containing no thematic elements  . 
Note that all lexical requirements minimally involve the existence of a hypothesized structure  . Thus the Property of Lexical Requirement ignores those structures whose lexical requirements are satisfied by either confirmed nodes or hypothesized nodes that contain thematic elements  . The PLR will penalize only those structures with unsatisfied lexical requirements  , where unsatisfied requirements consist of thematic element-less hypothesized structures  . 
When particular processing loads are associated with each of these properties  , they will make a large number of empirical predictions in the theory of overload and preference  . Since both the PTR and the PLR are properties dealing with the interpretation fanutterance  , it is reasonable to assume as a defaul that the loads associated with these two properties  , XTRPLUs and xt~PLUs respectively , are the same .  7  ( 11 ) xT e = x ~= x t~t It turns out that this a ~ssumption is consistent with all inequalities that are obtained in this paper  . 
4 Ambiguity and the Properties of
Thematic Reception and Lexical

In order to determine what load is associated with each of the Properties of Thematic Reception and Lexical Requirement  , I will first examine locally ambiguous en-tences that either cause or do not cause garden-path effects  . Consider sentence (12) with respect to the ~ and
PLR : (12) John expected Mary to like Fred.
The verb expect is ambiguous : either taking an NP complement as in the sentence John expected Mary or taking an IP complement as in  ( 12 )  . 8Thus there is a local ambiguity in ( 12 ) at the point of parsing the NP Mary . 
7In fact , both the 0-Criterion and the Projection Principle are generally believed to follow from a more general principle : that of Full Interpretation  ( Chomsky ( 1986 a ) ) . If this is so , then the PLR and the PTR reduce to a single property : that of local uninterpretability  . However , the principle of Full Interpretation has not yet been adequately formalized  . Thus I will continue to appeal only to its components  . 
8 Following current notation in GB Theory , IP = S and CP = S'(Chomsky (1986b)) . 
Despite this local ambiguity , there is no difficulty parsing (12) . Consider the state of the parse of ( 12 ) after the word
Mary has been processed : (13) a . \[ m\[NeJohn\]\[re expected LvpMary\]\]\] b  . \[ mLvpJohn\]\[vp expected\[m\[UPMary\ ]\]\]\] In  ( 13 a ) the NP Mary is attached as the NP complement of expected  . In this representation there is no load associated with either of the Properties of Thematic Reception or Lexical Requirement since all constituent shat are positions to receive thematic roles  , do so , and all lexical requirements are satisfied . In ( 13 b ) the NP Mary is the specifier of a hypothesized IP node which is attached as the complement of the o the reading of expected  . This representation is associated with at least xvnPLUs  ( = xlntPLUs ) since the NP Mary is in a position that can be associated with a thematic role  ( the subject position )  , but does not yet receive one in this structure . No load is associated with the Property of Lexical Requirement  , however , since the lexical requirements of the verb expected are satisfied by nodes that contain thematic elements  . Since there is no difficulty in processing sentence  ( 12 )  , the load difference between these two structures cannot be greater than PPLUs  , the preference factor assumed in inequality (2) . 
Thus the inequality in ( 14 ) is obtained : ( 14 ) Xlnt < PSince the load difference between the two structures in ots ufficient to cause a strong preference  , both structures are maintained . Note that this is a crucial difference between the theory presented here and the theory presented in Frazier & Fodor  ( 1978 )  , Fr~ier (1979) and Pritchett (1988) . In each of these theories , only one representation can be maintained , so that either ( 13 a ) or ( 13 b ) would be preferred at this point . In order to account for the lack of difficulty in parsing  ( 12 )  , Pritchett assumes that backtracking in certain situations is not expensive  . No such stipulation is necessary in the framework given here  . 
Now consider a second locally ambiguous . ,; entence , one that results in a garden-path effect : 9 ( 15 ) #iput the candy on the table in my mouth . 
Sentence ( 15 ) is locally ambiguous at the point of parsing the word on  . This preposition may attach as either an argument of the verb put  , or as a modifier of the noun table . The argument attachment is locally preferred , although it turns out that this attachment is not compatible with the rest of the sentence  . Thus a garden-path effect results . In order to see how the Properties of Thematic Reception and Lexical Requirement can account for this garden-path effect  , consider the state of the parse after the word on has been input :  ( 16 ) a . \[m\[upI\]\[vPIv , \[vput\]\[NP the candy\]\[ee on be 1\]   \]\]1 b . \[mJut , I \]\[ vt , \[ v , Ivput \] Ira , the candyb , e o n \[ u p 1\]\]   1\] The load associated with structure ( 16 a ) is xt ~ PLUs since , although the lexical requirements of the verb put are satisfied  , the lexical requirements of the preposition on remain unsatisfied  . On the other hand , the load associated with the modifier attachment is  2xt ~+ XTR PLUs since 1  ) both the verb put and the preposition on have unsatisfied  9I will prefix sentences that are difficul to parse because of memory limitations with the symbol " #"  . Hence sentences that are unacceptable due to processing overload will be prefixed with "#"  , as will be garden-path sentences . 
1163 lexical requirements and 2 ) the PP headed by on receives a thematic role in the argument attachment sructure  , while it receives no such role in the current structure  . T tlus the diffcrencc between the loads associated with the two structures is XLR+x rnPLUs =  2xt   , tPLUs . Since the argument attachment sructure is strongly preferred over the other structure  ,   1hypothesize that this load is greater than PPLUs : ( I7 ) 2x  ~ , ,t > P Now consider the wellknown garden-path sentence in  ( 18 )   ( Bever ( 1970 ) ):  ( 18 )  #The horse raced past the barn fell . 
The structure for the input the horse raced is ~ unbiguous between at least the two structures in  ( 19 ) :  ( 19 ) a . be\[~p the horse\]\[vPraced\]lb . \[m ~ e the IN , \[ IV , horse/\]\[cpOiraced\]\]\]\]Structure ( 19 a ) has no load associated with it due to either the PLR or the PTR  . Crucially note that the verb raced has an intransitive reading so that no load is required via the Property of Lexical Requirement  . On the other hand , structure (19b ) requircs aload of 2XT . ~ PLUs since 1 ) the noun phrase the horse is in a position that can receive a thematic role  , but currently does not and 2 ) the operator O ~ is in a position that may be associated with a the-matter ole  , but is not yet associated with one . t ? Thus file difference between the processing loads associated with structures  ( 19 a ) and ( 19b ) is 2x~PLUs = 2xl~tPLUs . By the inequality in (17) , this difference is sufficient to cause the preference of the less expensive structure  . Hence the garden-path effect in (18) is predicted . 
Consider (20) , a sentence whose structure and local ambiguities are very similar to those in  ( 18 ) :  ( 20 ) The bird found in the room was dead . 
Although the structures and local ambiguities in ( 20 ) and ( 18 ) are similar , (18) causes a garden-path effect while , surprisingly , (20) does not . To determine why ( 20 ) is not a garden-path sentence we need to cxamine the local ambiguity when the word found is read :   ( 21 ) a . \[) e\[UPtile bird\]\[vpIv , \[v found IN ?\]\]\]\]\] b .  \[0 , \[NV tile\[~v ' Dr , bird/\]\[cpOi found\]\]\]\] The crucial difference between the verb found and the verb raced is that found obligatorily requires a noun phrase object  , while raced does not . Since the lexical requirements of the verb found are not yet satisfied in structure  ( 21 a )  , this representation is associated with xt ~ PLUs of mcmory load  . Like structure (19b ) , structure (21b ) requires 2x~8PLUs . Thus the difference between the processing loads of structures  ( 21 a ) and ( 21b ) is 2x , rt?-x ~ PLUs = xtmPLUs . By the result obtained from sentence (12) , this load difference is not sufficient of orce a strong preference  . " Ilms the lack of garden-path effect in ( 20 ) is explained . Furthermore , these results correctly predict that sentence ( 22 ) is not a garden-path sentence ither : ( 22 ) Tilebird found in the room enough debristo build a nest  . 
Consider now ( 23 ) :  ( 23 ) #I believe that Johns mokes annoys Mary . 
1 ? In fact , this operator will be associated with a thematic role as soon as a gap-positing algorithm links it with the object of the passive participle raced  . However , when the attachment is initially made , no such link yet exists : the operator will initially be unassociated with a thematic role  . 
When the complement iz~e ? that is input ~ it c~n ~ attach as either the argument of the verb believe or as subject of believe's complement clause  . " File argument attachment is strongly prefen'ed and a garden-path effect results in  ( 23 )  , since it is the other reading that is necessary for a successful parse  . Consider the slate of the parse , after the word that has been input : (24) a . \[ reMe1\]\[vP believe\[ce\[c , \[ c that lie \]\]\]\]\]\] b . IreEve I\]\[v?believe\[ce\[c , \[ce\]\[m\[cP that\[m\]\]\] 1\] \]\] Consider first structure ( 24 a )  . All positions that can receive thematic roles , do so . Thus there is no load associated with ( 24 a ) with respect to the Property of Thematic Reception  . However tile complementizer that requires an IP complement  , so that x ~ PLUs are associated with (24a ) . Consider now (24b ) . First of all , the CP headed by that is in thematic role receiving position  , but it does not yet receive a thematic role . Thus ( 24b ) is associated with at least xT ~ PLUs . Furthermore , both the lexical complementizer that and the argument nonlexical complementizer of believe have lexical requirement shat must be satisfied  , but as yet are unsatisfied . Thus structure ( 24b ) is associated with an additional 2xt ~ PLUs via the Property of Lexical Requirement . Thus the total load associated with structure ( 24b ) is x rR+2 x ~ PLUs . Hence the difference between the loads of the structures in  ( 24 ) is x ~ q ? + x ~ PLUs = 2XlntPLUs . As we have see near- . 
lier , this load difference is sufficient for a preference to occur  . Thus the garden-path effect in (23) is predicted , as desired . 
See Gibson ( 1990 ) for explanations of further garden-path effects inside a similar framework  . 
5 Processing Overload and the Properties of Thematic Reception and Lexical 

The Properties of Thematic Reception and Lexical Requirement also give a plausible account of unacceptability due to processing overload  . Recall that I assmne that a sentence is unacceptable because of shortterm memory overload if the combination of memory associated with properties of the structures built at some stage of the parse of the sentence is greater than the allowable processing load K  . Consider the unacceptable cnter-embedding sentences in  ( 25 ) :  ( 25 ) a .  #The man that the woman that w on the race likes eats fish  . 
b .  #The man that the woman that the dog bit likes eats fish  . 
Consider one structure that results from parsing either of the sentences in  ( 25 ) after the second compleme utizer that has been input :  ( 26 ) Ire Lyetile Lv , \[ N'mani\]\[cP\[NeOi\]that\[m\[m , the IN'~' woman j\]I ce\[NeOj\]that\[m \]\]\]\]\]\]\]\]\] First consider  ( 26 ) with respect to the Property of Theematic Reception  . There are two lexical noun phrases in ( 26 ) that need thematic roles but lack them . Furthermore , there are two nonlexical NPs , operators , that are in positions that may prospectively be linked to thematic roles  . 
Thus the load associated with ( 26 ) is at least 4x~RPLUS . 
Now consider ( 26 ) with respect to the Property of Lexical Requirement  . Only the two complementizers have lexic ~ d 4   I17 requirements in ( 26 )  , and only the most recent of these is unsatisfied , since the lexical requirements of the first are satisfied by a hypothesized node with thematic ontent  . 
Thus the totaload associated with ( 26 ) is 4xrR+xt ~ PLUS = 5xtntPLUs . I hypothesize that this load is too much for the limited capacity of working memory:Indeed  , when noun phrases with two levels of center -embedded relative clauses appear postverbally  , the re-suits are still unacceptable , although perhaps better : (27) a . ? #I saw the man that the woman that w on the race likes  . 
b .  #I saw the man that the woman that the dog bit likes  . 
Since the NP theman receives a thematic role as so on as it is parsed  , it does not contribute to the processing load in either of the sentences in  ( 27 )  . However , other factors in determining the maximal processing load of the sentences in  ( 27 ) remain the same . Thus the maximalload in each of ( 27 a ) and ( 27 b ) is 4xt ~ tPLUs . Since each of these sentences i unacceptable , I hypothesize that this load is more than can be handled by the shorterm memory capacity :  ( 28 )   4xlnt > K Note that sentences with only one relative clause modifying a subject NP are acceptable  , as is exemplified in ( 29 )   ( 29 ) The man that Mary like seats fish . 
Since (29) is acceptable , its load is below the maximum at all stages of its processing  . Under the assumptions presented in this paper , the processing load associated with ( 29 ) will be greatest when the complementizer that is input  . At this point in the parse , there will be one lexical NP , the man , and one nonlexical NP , an operator , that require thematic roles but currently lack them  . Furthermore , the complementizer that requires a complement IP which is not yet present  . Thus the total load associated with ( 29 ) at the point of parsing that is 3xtntPLUs . 11 Since there is no difficulty in parsing (29) , we arrive at the inequality in ( 30 ) :  ( 30 )   3xt~t < K Thus I assume that the maximum processing load that people can handle lies above  3xtnt PLUs but below 4xt~t PLUs . Further data support this conclusion . For example , consider the contrast between the sentences in ( 3 lb ) :  ( 31 ) a . That Johns mokes annoys me . 
b .  #That for John to smoke would annoyme is obvious  . 
Although it is possible for a clause to be subject of a matrix clause  , as in (31a ) , an unacceptables ntence results when the subject clause contains a further clause as its subject  , as in (3Ib ) . The acceptability of ( 3 la ) together with the unacceptability of ( 3 lb ) can be easily explained in the framework offered here  . Consider first sentence (31a ) . The maximal processing load associated with the parse of  ( 31 a ) occurs as the words that and John are processed . In both of these states the load is 2xt ~ tPLUs , less than the available memory capacity . Thus there is no ~ In fact , the load remains at 3x ~ PLUs when the NP Mary is input : the NP Mary requires a thematic role  , thus adding to the processing load , but the lexical requirements of the complementizer that also become satisfied at this point  , since a thematic element , Mary , is now present in the hypothesized IP complement . 
difficulty in the processing of (31a ) . Consider , however , the state of the parse of ( 31b ) after the complementizer for has been input : ( 32 ) \[tp\[cethat\[tp\[cefor\[m\]\]\]\]\ ] There are two complementizer phrases  , both in thematic positions , which currently lack thematic roles . Furthermore , both complementizers have lexical requirements that are currently unsatisfied : that is  , the complement of each complementizer neither contains a thematic element nor is a confirmed node  . Thus the total load associated with ( 32 ) is 4Xlnt PLUs , which is enough ~ of orce processing overload . Thus the unacceptability of (32) is explained . 
Furthermore , the acceptability of ( 33 ) comes as no surprise to the account presented here:  ( 33 ) I believe that for John to smoke would annoyme . 
In contrast to (31b ) , the first complementizer in ( 33 ) receives a thematic role as soon as it is processed  . Thus the maximal processing load associated with the parse of  ( 33 ) is only 3xt nt PLUs , not enough to overload shorterm memory . 
5.1 Processing Overload : Cross-Linguistic

The examples discussed thus far are all English ones  . A strong test of the theory presented here is presented by data from other languages  . First let us consider center-embed dexl relative clauses in languages closely related to English  . In particular , consider Dutch and German . It turns out that multiply center-embedded r lative clauses become difficult in these languages at the stone point as they do in English : on the second embedding  . For example , the German sentence (34) is unacceptable , as ex-pected : ( 34 )  #DerMann den die Fraudie der Hund bibsah schwam  . 
" The man that the woman that the dog bit saws wam . " Unlike English , however , German and Dutch are verb final in subordinate clauses  , so that verbs with lexical requirements for three thematic elements pose an interesting test to the theory  . If the theory presented here is correct and it generalizes crosslinguistically  , then constructions with three initial 0-role-requiring constituents should be acceptable . It turns out that this is in fact the case , as the
German example (35) illustrates : (35) Ich glaube , dabJohn Mary das Geschenk gegeben hat . 
I believe that John Mary the present given has " I believe that John has given Mary the present  . "After the word Geschenk , there are three noun phrases that require thematic roles  , but currently lack them . All lexical requirements are satisfied at this point in the parse  , so the total load associated with this parse state is  3x~t PLUs . Thus (35) is predicted to acceptable , as desired . 
Another good test for the theory presented here comes from cross-serial dependencies in Dutch  . 12In examples of cross-serial dependency , noun phrase arguments appear at the beginning of a subordinate clause  , followed by their thematic role assigning verbs . It turns out that 12See Bresnan et al ( 1982 ) for a discussion of the syntax of such constructions  . 
1 18   5 constructions with three initial noun phrases are perfex  ; tly acceptable , as is exemplified in (36): (36) . . . ( hat Jan Piet de kinderenza ghelpenz wemmen . 
. . . that Jan Pier the children saw help swim " . . . tluttJansawPiethelp the childrens wim ?' However  , these constructions lose their acceptability with rite addition of further NP arguments :  ( 37 ) a . .9#  . . . dat Jan Piet Marie de kinderen zaghelpen laten zwemmen  . 
. . . that Jan Piet Marie the children saw help make swim "  . . . that Jan saw Piethelp Made make the children swim  . " b .  #  . . . dat Jan Piet Marie Kareldek in derenza ghelpen latenlerenz wemmen  .

" This result is predicted in the frarue work presented here  . Four NP arguments locally lacking thematic roles force aload of  4xtnt   , too much for human shorterm memory capacity . 
Evidence from the processing of Japanese also supports the memory capacity results obtained here  . Japanese is a verb final language , so that subjects and objects appear before the verb  . Verbs that lake clausal complements provide an interesting test case for the theory presented here  , since it is grammatical to place all NP arguments before the thematic role assigning verbs  . For example , consider ( 38 ) :  ( 38 ) Jonwa Fredga Biruwesukidatoomotteiru . 
John TOPIC Fred NOM Bill A Celikes COMP thinks " John think stlmt Fred likes Bill " Sentence  ( 38 ) is perfectly acceptable , as is predicted by the theory presented here . The processing load associated with ( 38 ) peaks at the point that the NP Biru is input : at this point there are three NP arguments which require thematic roles but currently lack them  . As a result , the processing load associated with this processing state is  3xtnt PLUs , not enough to cause overload . However , when more than three NP arguments appear sentence initially  , acceptability is lost , as predicted by the processing overload results obtained here:  ( 39 ) a . ? #Jonwa Maryga Fredga Biruwesukidato sinjiteiru too motteiru  .

"  6 Conclusions Since the structural properties that are used in the formation of the inequalities are independently motivated  , and the system of inequalities is olvable , the tllex ) 1 3r of human sentence processing presented here makes strong  , testable predictions with respect to the prtu = essability of a given sentence  . Fm~thermore , the success of the method provides empirical support for the particular properties used in the formation of the inequalities  . ~\[ husa theory of PLUs , the preference I~lctorPmid file overload face to tK provides a unified account of  1  ) acceptability and relative acceptability ; 2) garden-path effects ; and 3 ) pre~ferred readings form n biguous input and perception of ambiguity  .
