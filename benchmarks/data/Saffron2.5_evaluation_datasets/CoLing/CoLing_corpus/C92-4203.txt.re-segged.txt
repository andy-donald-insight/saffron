Abstract
This paper describes a JapaneseEnglish translation aid system  , C'I'M , which has a use fid capability for flexible retrieval of texts from hilingaal corpora or translation databases  . Translation examples ( pairs of a text and its translation equivalent ) are very helpful for us to translate the similar text  . Our character-based best match retrieval method can re : trieve translation example similar to the given input  . 
This method has the following advantages : ( 1 ) this method accepts freestyle translation examples  , i . e . , pairs of any text string and its translation equivalent  , (2) morphological analysis is unnecessary , (3) this method accepts fl'ce-Myleinlmts(i . e . , any text strings ) for retrieval . We show the retrieval examples with the following characteristic features : phrasal expression  , long-distance dependency , idiom , synonym , mad semantic ambiguity . 
1 Introduction
In the late 1980's , several commercial JapaneseEnglish machine translation systems had heen developed in Japan  , In these systems , the computer is the agent of translation , while the user assists in editing the translation inputs and revising the results  . Although they are usefal to translate large amounts of texts roughly and rapidly  , high quality translation is impossible . 
Translation aM is another kind of machine translation : the user is the agent of translation  , while the computer provides himor her with the help fifl tools  , e . g . , quick-retrieval electronic dictionaries . A quick-retrieval bilingual corpus is also use fifl  , specifically when it h , ' ~ s the flexihle ( best match ) retrieval mechanism . Because translatiml examples ( pairs of source text , and its translation equivalent ) are very helpful for us to translate the similar text  . This type of system is called a ~ example-based translalion aid  \[6\]  , and there are two prototype systems in JapaneseEnglish translation : ETOC  \[8\] and Nakanmra ' system \[5\]  .

Figure hB~ic Configuration of Example-B,'Lsed
Translation Aid
Figure I shows the basic configuration of example -ha~ed translation aid  ( EI~TA )  . It consists of two components : the translat ion database is the collection of translation examples  , and the best match re-trieval engine is to retrieve the example that is the most similar to the given input text  . The characteristic of the EBTA system is that it accepts freestyle texl inputs for the retrieval : it frees the user from learning the tbrmal language for data h  , ~se query . 
' l ' he central problem in EBTA is the implementation of the hest match retrieval  . Two methods were proposed : one is the syntax -matching driven by generalization rules in ETOC  \[8\]  , and the other is Naka-nmra's method using content words  \[5\]  . They are the word-based best match retrieval methods  1  , which need morphological analysis . 
This paper proposes the character-based best match retrieval method  , specifically for Japanese texts Compared with the word-hased methods  , the charaeter-h~sed method has the following advantages : ? Morphological analysis is unnecessary  . 
? Some kind of synonyms can he retrieved without a thesallrls  . 
This method has been implemented in CTM ~ , a JapaneseEnglish translation aid system for writ -ing/translating technical papers  .

Match Retrieval Method 2 . 1 Character i s t i cs o f Japanese Wr i t - ten Texts Japanese written texts have remarkable characteristics as follows  . ' riley canno the found in European languages , i . e . , English , French , and German . 
1. The number of characters is very large.
The numher of characters that are used ill text is more than  7  , 000 in Japanese . while it is less than a hundred in a European language  . 
2. Synouyms often have the same Kanji character.
Japanese characters are divided into three types ' . Hi-ragana (83 characters) , Katakana (86 characters) , and Kanji . Altiragana or Katakana character expresses a sound  , and a Kanji characte represents a semantic primitive  . For example , tile Kanji character " ~" means " thinking " , and it is used for construct-lug several words concerned with thinking : e  . g . ,  , ~(~( thinking ) ~" , ~ , ( consideration ) ,  ~ , ~' ( deep thinking ) , ~ ~ Ta(think ) , ~\[~TTa(devise ) . 
3. There is no delimiter between words.
Inl " uropean languages , the whitespace is the delimiter for word separation  . In contrast , Japanese has no explicit delimiter . Therefore , the main part of Japanese morphological analysis is to divide a text string into words : it is not easy task a  . 
These characteristics of Japanese suggest the character-based best lllatel  , becanse IW hile the word-based method needs morphological analysis  , the character-bmsed method does not need it . 
2 . In order to retrieve synonyms the word-based method needs a thesaurus  . In coutra . s t , the character-based method call retrieve some kind of synonyms with on tathes all rus  , because synonynls often have tile same Kanji character in Japanese  . 
2.2 The Character-Based Best Match
The character-based best match can be determined by defining the distance or similarity measure between two strings  . 
The simple measure of similarity hetween two strings  , A = alau . . . a  ~ . , H = btb 2 .   .   . by , is the number of the matching characters considering the character order constraint  . It is not particularly good a For example , a Jap & llese morphoh ~ gical an MyMspFOgl '& lll developed by Nyolt ~ University fails to an Myze  3  ~  , 5% of
Selllell CeS.
memsure , bat makes a convenient starting point . We define it as follows : s(i , j ) = 0 if i = ovj = os(i-l , jl ) + m(i , j ) , ) maxs(il , j ) , s(i , j1 ) if ( l_<i<x ) A ( 1 <_j < y ) 1 if a ~= b3mi , j ) = 0 if a , ~ bj This measure often produces the undesirable re-suits  , because we ignore continuation of matching characters  . For example , consider the following strings :
A = I"I~R4~'?70 ( solve the problem ) f ~ = t ~ a~m 5 , ~ j ~1 ce ~ Ltco ( He solved the problem yesterday . )  ( determinetile method for solving the problem ) We want to be S ( A , 13) >  , 9(A , F ?') , but the above measure produces , 5'( A , B ) < , S '( A , B ~) . To solve the problem , we consider tile bonus for contimmns matching characters  . It can be done by modifying m(i , j ) m the the above definition : , 5'( A , ,~) = s(x , : j)s(i , j ) = . s(i--1 , j1) + min(cm(i , j ) , W ) maxs(i-l , j ) , s(i , j-1) if ( l<i < ~) A(1_<j_<y ) ~ , ,~(/ , j ) = 0 if i = OVj = Oem(il , j-1) + m(i , j ) if ( 1_<i_<x ) ^ ( ~_ < j < :/ ) 1 if ai = b j m ( i , j )  =  0 if ai ~ bj This is the similarity score that we use  , where W is a parameter that determines the max imum value of the bonus fortile continuons matching characters  . When 14" = 1 , this definition is the same with tile previous definition  . Tablel shows , 5'( A , B ) and S(A , B ') with varying vahws of W . l_lsually we use W = 4 . 44' l'h is value was de tem ni , tedem pirically .

Figure 8: Example ( Amhiglfity )   5 Evaluation It is very difficult to evaluate a translation aid system  , because its effectiveness essentially depends on the user's satisfaction : when the user feels that the system is help fld  , it is effective . The evaluation of CTM is now in progress , an < l we show some results of experiments here . 
The Retrieval Time
F , mpirieally , we oht aim ' d the following equation , which estimates the retriewd time ( millisecond ) . 
time(I , k , N ) = Ix ( D0 xk+2/3xN ) where I is tile length of tile input string , k(megabyte ) is the database size , and Nistile we-selection parameter . For e?ample , if /= D0 ( characters ) , k = 8(megabyte ) , N=200 , then time = 2 , 133 ( millisecond ) . It shows that tile current systeln responses ill a few seconds and it is not so fi~st  . The more acceleration is need for the larger data h  , ~e . 
Evaluation of 100 retrievals
W c h a v e e v a h m t e d 100 retrieval results I~y h and We have given one of ttle following grades to each retrieved example  . 
A The example exactly matches the input.
B The example provides enough infornmtion about tile translation of the whole input  . 
C The examl ) le provides information ahout the translation of some part of the input  .
