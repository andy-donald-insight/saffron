After 3 years of specifying the UNL ( Universal Networking Language ) language and prototyping deconverters I from more than  12 languages and enconverters for about 4  , the UNL project has opened to the community by publishing the specifcations  ( v2 . 0) of the UNL language , intended to encode the meaning of NL utterances as semantic hypergraphs and to be used as a " pivot " representation in multilingual information and communication systems  . 
AUNL document is an html document with special tags to delimit the utterances and their rendering in UNL and in all natural languages currently handled  . UNL can be viewed as the future " html of the linguistic content "  . It is only an interface format , leading as well to the reuse of existing NLP components as to the development of original tools in a variety of possible applications  , from automatic roughen conversion for information retrieval and information gathering translation to partially interactiven conversion or deconversion for higher quality  . 
We illustrate these points by describing an UNL -French deconverter organized as a specific " localizer " followed by a classical MT transfer and an existing generator  . 

UNL , interlingua , pivot , deconversion , UNL~French localization , transfer , generation . 

The UNL project of network-oriented multilinguat communication has proposed a standard for encoding the meaning of natural language utterances as semantic hypergraphs intended to be used as pivots in multilingual information and communication systems  . In the first phase (1997-1999) , more than 16 partners representing 14 languages have worked to build deconverters transforming an  ( interlingual ) UNL hypergraph into a natural language utterance . 
In this project , the strategy used to achieve this initial objective is free  . The UNL-French deconverter under development first performs a " localization " operation within the UNL format  , and then classical transfer and generation steps , using the Ariane-G5 environment and some
UNL-specifc tools.
The use of classical transfer and generation steps in the context of an interlingual project may sound surprising  . But it reflects many interesting issues about the status of the UNL language  , designed as an interlingua , but diversely used as a linguistic pivot ( disambiguated abstract English )  , or as a purely semantic pivot . 
After introducing the UNL language , we present the architecture of the UNL-French deconverter  , which " generates " from the UNL interlinguaby first " localizing " the UNL form for French  , within UNL , and then applying slightly adapted but classical transfer and generation techniques  , implemented in the Ariane-G5 environlnent , supplemented by some UNL-specific tools . 
Then , we discuss the use of the UNL language as a linguistic or semantic pivot for highly multilingual information systems  . 
1 The UNL project and language 1 . 1 The project UNL is a project of multilingual personal networking communication initiated by the University of United Nations based in Tokyo  . 
The pivot paradigm is used : the representation I The terms << deconvcrsion  , and < ~ enconv crsion , are specific totile UNL proiect and are defined at paragraph  2  . 
768 of an utterance in the UNL interlingua ( UNL stands for " Universal Networking Language " ) is a hyl ) ergraph where normal nodes bear UWs CU niversal Words "  , or interlingual acceptions ) with semantic attributes , and arcs bear semantic relations ( deep cases , such as agt , obj , goal , etc . ) . 
Hypernodes group a subgraph defined by a set of connected arcs  . AUW denotes a set of interlingual acceptions ( word senses )  , although we often loosely speak of " the " word sense demoted by a UW  . 
Because English is known by all UNL developers , the syntax of at lormal WW is : "< English word or compound >  ( < list of restrictions > )  " , O . Z . " look for ( icl > action , agt > human , obj > thing ) "Going fronlate xt to the corresponding " UNL text " or interactively constructing a UNL text is called " enconversio if '  , while producing a text fiom a sequence of UNL graphs is called " deconversion "  . 
This departure fi'om the standard terms of analysis and generation is used to stress that this is not a classical M\]: projecl  , bu ! that UNL is planned to be the source format preferred for representing textual in l : ormation intile envisaged multilingual network environment  . 
Tileschedule of tile project , beginning with deconversion rather than cn convcrsion  , also reflects that difference . 
1 4 hm guages have been tackled during the first 3--year phase of the prqject ( 1997-1999 )  , while many more arc to be added in tile second phase  . Each group is fi-ee to reuse its own software lools and/orling w are resources  , or to develop directly with tools provided by tile 
UNL Center ( UNU/IAS).
Emphasis is on a very large lexical coverage , so that all groups spend most of their time on tile UNL-NL lexicons  , and develop tools and methods for efficient lexical development  . By contrast , gramnmrs have been initially limited to those necessary for deconversion  , and will then b cgradually expanded to allow for more naturalness m formulating text to be enconverted  . 
1 . 2 The UNL components 1 . 2 . 1 Universal Words Tile nodes of a UNL utterance are called Universal Words  ( or Uws )  . The syntax of a normal UW consists of 2 parts : a head word , a list of restrictions
Because English is known by all UNL developers , tile head word is an English word or compound . The restrictions are given as all attribute value pail " where attributes are semantic relation labels  ( as the ones used in the graphs ) and wllues are other UWs ( restricted or not )  . 
AUW denotes a collection of interlingual acceptions  ( word senses )  , although we often loosely speak of " the " word sense denoted by an UW  . For example , the unrestricted UW " look for " denotes all the word senses associated to tile English compound word " look for "  . Tile restricted UW " look for ( icl > action , agt > human , obj > thing ) " represents all tile word senses of the English word " look for " that are an action  , perl % rmed by a human that affects a thing . In this case this leads to the word sense : " look for-to try to find "  . 
1.2.2 UNL hypergraph
AUNL expression is a hypergraph ( a graph where a node is simple or recursively contains a hypergraph  )  . Tile arcs bear semantic relation labels ( deep cases , such as agt , obj , goal , etc . ) .

This includes phenomena like speech acts , truth wllues , time , etc . 
Hypernodes may also be used ill UNL expressions.

1.2.3 Denoting a UNL graph
These hypergraphs are denoted using the UNL language per se  . In the UNL hmguagc , an the different nodes . As an example , the graph presented in figure 1 . 1 will be denoted as : agt(score( . . . ) . @entry . @past . @complete,
Ronaldo ) obj(score(_ . ) . @entry . @past . @complete , goal(icl > thing )) ins ( score( . . . )  . @ entry . @past . @complete , head(p of>body )) plt(score( . . . )  . @ entry . @past . @complete , corner ) obj ( corner , goal(icl > thing )) mod(corner , left ) Hy per nodes are denoted by numbers . The graph contained by a hypernode is denoted as a set of arcs colored by this number as in : agt  ( : Ol . @ entry , driver . @ pl ) aoj ( reckless , driver . @ pl ) and : Ol(drive , drink . @ entry ) Entries of the graph and subgraphs are denoted with the "  . @ entry " attribute . 
2 Inside the French deconverter 2 . 1 Overv iew Deconversion is the process of transforming a UNL graph into one  ( or possibly several ) utterance in a natural language . Any means may be used to achieve this task . Many UNL project partners use a specialized tool called DeCobut  , like several other partners , we choose to use our own tools for this purpose . 
One reason is that DeCorealizes the deconversion in one step  , as in some transfer-based MT systems such as METAL  \[17\]  . We prefer to use a more modular architecture and to split deconversion into  2 steps , transfer and generation , each divided into several phases , most of them written in Arlene-G 5 . 
Another reason for not using DeCois that it is not well suited for the morphological generation of inflected languages  ( several thousands rules are needed for Italian , tens of thousands for Russian , but only about 20 rules and 350 affixes suffice to build an exhaustive GM for French in Sygmor  )  . Last , but not least , this choice allows us to reuse modules already developed for French generation  . 
This strategy is illustrated by figure 2.1.

Fig .  2 . 1 :2 possible deconvers q on strategies Using this approach  , we segment the decon-version process into 7 phases , as illustrated by figure 2 . 2 . 
The third phase ( graph-to-tree ) produces a decorated tree which is fed into an Ariane-G5 
TS ( structural transfer).

Fig .  2 . 2: architecture of the French deconverter 2 . 2 Transfer 2 . 2 . 1 Validation When we receive a UNL Graph for decon -version  , we first check it for correctness . AUNL graph has to be connected , and the different features handled by the nodes have to be defined in UNL  . 
If the graph proves incorrect , an explicit error message is sent back . This validation has to be performed to ilaprove robustness of the deconverter  , as there is no hypothesis on the way a graph is created  . When a graph proves valid , it is accepted for deconversion . 
2.2.2 Loeal & ation
In order to be correctly deconverted , tile graph has to be slightly modified . 
2.2.2.1 Lexical localization
Some lexical units used in the graph may not be present in the French deconversion dictionary  . 
This problem may appear under different circumstances  . First , the French dictionary ( which is still under development ) may be incomplete . Second , the UWn my use an unknown notation to represent a known French word sense  , and third , the LAV may represent a non-French word sense . 
We solve these problems with the same method : Let w be a UW in the graph G  . Let D be the French dictionary ( a set of UWs ) . We substitute w in G by w ' such that : w'eD and VxeDd  ( w , w ' , G ) = d(w , x , G ) . where d is a pseudo-distance function . 

If different French UWs are at the same pseudo -distance of w  , w ' is chosen at random among these UWs ( default in non-interactive mode )  . 
2.2.2.2 " Cultural " localization
Some crucial information may be missing , depending on the language of the source utterance  ( sex , modality , number , determination , politeness , k in ship . . . ) . 
It is in general impossible to solve this problem fully automatically in a perfect manner  , as we do not know anything about the document , its c : on text , and its intended usage : FAHQDC 2 is no more possible than FAHQMT on arbitrary texts  . 
We have to rely on necessarily imperfect heuristics  . 
t to wever , we can specialize tile general French deconverter to produce specialized servers for different tasks and different  ( target ) sublanguages . It is possible to assign priorities not only to various parts of the dictionaries  ( e . g . , specialized vs . general ) , but also to equivalents of the same UW within a given dictionary  . We can then define several user profiles . It is also possible to build a memory of deconverted and possibly postedited utterances for each specialized French deconversion server  . 
2.2.3 Lexical Transfer
After the localization phase , we have to perform the lexical transfer . It would seem natural to do ill within Ariane-G5 , after converting the graph into a tree . But lexical transfer is context-sensitive , and we want to avoid the possibility of transferring differently two tree nodes corresponding to one and the same graph node  . 
Each graph node is replaced by a French lcxical unit  ( LU )  , along with some variables . A lexical unit used in tile French dictionary denotes a derivational family  ( e . g . in English : destroy denotes destroy , destruction , destructible , destructive . . . . in French : d6truire for d6truire , destruction , destructible , in destructible , destruct if , destructeur ) . 
There may be several possible lexical units for one UW  . This happens when there is a real synonymy or when differenterms are used in different domains to denote the same word sense  3  . In that case , we currently choose tile lexical unit at random as we do not have any information on tile task the deconverter is used for  . 
Tile same problem also appears because of tile slrategy used to build the French dictionary  . In order to obtain a good coverage from the beginning  , we have underspecified tile UWs and linked them to dift ' ercnt lexical units  . This way , we considered a UW astile denotation of a set of word senses in French  . 
Hence , we were able to reuse previous dictionaries and we can use the dictionary even if it is still under development and in colnplete  . 
In our first version , we also solve this problem by a random selection of a lexical unit  . 
2.2.4 Graph to tree conversion
The subsequent deconversion phases are performed in  Ariane-G5  . Hence , it is necessary to converthe UNL hypergraph into an Ariane- 
G5 decorated tree.
The UNL graph is directed . Each arc is labelled by a semantic relation ( agt , obj , ben , con . . . ) and each node is decorated by a UW and a set of features  , or is a hypernode . One node is distinguished as the " entry " of the graph  . 
An ARIANE tree is a general ( nonbinary ) tree with decorations on its nodes . Each decoration is a set of wlriable-value pairs . 
The graph-to-tree conversion algorithln has to lnaintain the direction and labelling of the graph along with the decoration ot ' the nodes  . 
Our algorithm split stile nodes that are the target of more than one arc  , and reverses the direction of as few arcs as possible  . An example of such a conversion is shown in figure  2  . 3 .

A then 2.2.5 Structural transfer
The purpose of the structural transfer is to transform the tree obtained so far into a Generating Multilevel Abstract  ( GMA ) structure\[4\] . 
In this structure , non-interlingual linguistic levels ( syntactic functions , syntagmatic categories . . . ) are underspecified , and ( if present ) , are used only as a set of hints for the generation stage  . 
2.3 Generation 2.3.1 Paraphrase choice
The next phase is in charge of the paraphrase choice  . During this phase , decisions are taken regarding the derivation applied to each lexical unit in order to obtain the correct syntaglnatic category for each node  . During this phase , the order of appearance and the syntactic functions of each parts of the utterance is also decided  . 
The resulting structure is called Unique
Multilevel Abstract ( UMA ) structure.
2 . 3 . 2 Syntactic and morphological generation The UMA structure is still lacking the syntactic sugar used in French to realize the choices made in the previous phase by generating articles  , auxiliaries , and nonconnected compund such as ne . . . pas , etc . 
The role of this phase is to create a Unique Multilevel Concrete  ( UMC ) structure . By concrete , we mean that the structure ~ s projective , hence the corresponding French text may be obtained by a standard left to right traversal of the leaves and simple morphological and graphemic rules  . The result of these phases is a surface French utterance  . 
3 Different uses of the UNL language 3 . 1 Hypergraphs vs colored graphs As presented in section  1  . 2 . 3 , the syntax of the UNL language is based on the description of a graph  , arc by arc . Some of these arcs are " coloured " by a number . This colouring is currently interpreted as hypernodes  ( nodes containing a graph , rather than a classical UW ) . 
This interpretation is arbitrary and imposes semantic on straints on a UNL utterance : the subgraph  ( the set of arcs labeled with the same colour ) is connected , arcs with different colours cannot be connected to the same node  . 
However , even if one uses the UNL language for a particular kind of application  , a different interpretation may be chosen . By adding new semantic constraints to UNL expressions  , one may restrict othe use of trees . On the contrary , by loosening semantic on straint , one may use colored graphs instead of the more restrictive hypergraphs  . 
This flexibility of UNL may lead to uses that differ from the computer science point of view  ( different structures leading to different kinds of methods and applications  ) as well as from the linguistic point of view ( different ways to represent the linguistic content of a utterance  )  . 
This kind of structure is very useful to represent some utterances like " Christian pulls Gilles ' leg "  . Using a colored graph , one can represent the utterance with the graph shown in figure  3  . 1, which is not a hypergraph .

3.2 Linguistic vssen mntie pivot
The UNL language defines the interface structure to be used by applications  ( either a hypergraph or a colored graph )  . However , it does not restrict the choice of the data to be encoded  . 
Since tile beginning , two possible and wflidapl ~ roaches has been mentioned  . During the kickoff meeting of tile UNL prelect , Pr . Tsujiiprol noted the use of UNL as a linguistic pivot  . 
With this approach , a UNL utterance should be the encoding of the deep structure of a valid English utterance that reflects the meaning of the source utterance  . With this approach , the German sentence " Hans schwimts ehrger n " should be encoded as shown in figure  3  . 3 .

Each approach has its advantages and drawbacks and the choice between them can only be made with an application in mind  . The linguistic approach leads to a better quality ill the produced results and is an answer to highly multilingual machine translation projects  . With this approach , the UNL graphs can only be produced by people mastering English or by  ( partially ) automatic enconverters . 
With the semantic approach , subtle differences in source utterances ( indefinite , reflexivity . . . ) cannot be expressed , leading to a lower quality . 
However , using this approach , the UNL encoding is much more natural and easy to perform by a nonEnglish speaker  ( as the semantic relations and UWs are expressed at the source level  )  . Hence , this approach is to be used for multilingual casual communication where users may express themselves by directly encoding UNL expressions with an appropriate editing tool  . 
Conclusion
Working oil tile French de convel-ter has led to im interestiug architecture where deconversion  , in principlea " generation from interlingua " , is implemented as transfer + generation from all abstract structure  ( UNL hypergraph ) produced from a NL utterance . The idea to use UNL for directly creating documents gets here an indirect and perhaps paradoxical support  , although it is clear that considerable progress and innovative interface design will be needed to make it practical  . 
However , the UNL language proves flexible enough to be used by very different proiects  . 
Moreover , with deconverters currently developed for 14 languages , joining the UNL project is really attractive . Let's hope that this effort will help breaking the language barriers  .
