1 Introduction
Common verbs such as " take , "" have , "
" make , " and " give " appear frequently in English . These verbs quite often constitute verb- deverbal noun structures such as " make an address  , " give an answer " and " take an approach . " The verbs in the structure arc ahnost devoid of lexical meaning but bear syntactic information such as tense  , number and person ; the deverbal noun carrying the lexical meaning . The verbs , in this case , are called " d c lexical verbs "\[ Collins \] or "light verbs  , "\[ Live\]which refers to their lexical emptiness  . 
In this paper , we call such verbs Delexical Verbs ( DV ) and a " DV + deverbal noun structure " a Delexical Structure  ( DS ) Iollowing the example sol'\[Collins\] . The frequency of these verbs in actual text can be seen  , for example , in the COLLINSCOBUILDENGLISHDIC-TIONARY , where the pmagraph on the entry " take " states : " The most frequent use of take is in expressions where it does not have a very distinct meaning of its " own  , but where most of the meaning is in the noun that follows it  . . . " We have been developing an English to Japanese machine translation system for news broadcasts since  1989 \[Aizawa \]\[ Tanaka \] . The precise translation of DS's in news texts is of great importance since they are quite frequent here  . We counted the number of " take "+" noun " collocations  ( as verb+object ) in 21 months ' worth of AP texts using the parser of the machine translation system  . " Take " collocated with 2 , 188 different nouns a total of 20 , 271 times . Of the collocating nouns ,   87 deverbal nouns were found out of the 119 deverbal nouns listed in \[ Live\] , comprising about 28% (5 , 726) of all occurrences . This figure strongly supports the statement in the Collins Dictionary  . 
Failures in DS translation typically result from producing the primary sense instead of the delexical sense of the DV  , which greatly dete-rior at cs the quality of the translation  . For example , " make an address " becomes " enzetsu wotsukuru , " which meaTts " create an address . " There are two possible ways of translating a DS . The first is the idiosyncratic approach , listing all the DS's with their Japanese translations in a lexical system  . This approach , however , suffers fi ' om several shortcomings : ( 1 ) The DS's are numerous and hard to list exhaustively : some DS's allow ptts sivization and some deverbal nouns can be modified by quantifiers  , adjectives and so on . This doubles and triples the number of possible
DS combinations.
(2 ) This direct method is unable to infer the translation of a DS undefined in a lexicon  . 
(3 ) The use of this approach increases then uln ber of lexical entries  , making lexical management difficult . 
Another approach is to synthesize the translation of a DS using the word sense of each component with syntactic and semantic rules  . The attractive part of this " synthetic approach " is that it does not suffer from the problems mentioned above  . The " n to nosenty approach " proposed in \[ Ruhl\ ] can be viewed as the extreme manifestation of the synthetic approach  . A recent lexical framework\[Bograev\]proposes to generate the word sense instead of listing them exhaustively in a lexicon  , which is similar to the synthetic approach . 
However , fl'om a practical viewpoint , not MIDS's can bc translated by this approach as the necessary rules have not yet been factored out  . 
We propose the use of a DS translation method based mainly on synthesis  , and the employment of all idiosyncratic approach where synthesis is difficult  . To do this , DS's were categorized into three groups , called type-l , type 2 , and idiomatic DS . The first two groups are translated by the synthetic method and the last group is trans -ACRESDE  COLING-92  , NANTES . 2328 AOt ~ r1992567 PROC . OFCOLING-92, NA ~ CrES , AUG .  2328 ,   1992 lated by an idiosyncratic approach which can hopefully be integrated into the former part as research reveals the underlying rules  . This method should provide clear distinctions between idiomatic and synthesizable DS's through the use of a set of rules  , which would facilitate the management of lexical systems  . 
The translation rules are quite simple t br the following reasons :  ( 1 ) English DS~s have Japanes equivalents in many cases  , and some parallels can be seen between them . 
(2 ) Many Japanese " verbal nouns " take the form of " sahen-meishi  , " which become verbs by simply adding " suru " to the tail  . 
However , some DS's require translation in a passive sense . The conditions were factored out through semantic onsideration  , and were integrated into the translation rules . 
The rules were implemented in the machine translation system and AP news texts were translated appropriately  , thus proving the feasibility of this method . 
2 Delexical Structures
This section introduce some definitions and characteristics of DS's  . ADS basically takes the foml : Delexieal Verb+ ( determiner ) + Deverbal
Noun0: optional as in " give an answer , "" make an array , "" take an approach , " have a battle , "" take advice , " and " make an announcement . " Verbs such as " put , "" cast , "" pay , "" lay , " and " throw " are also known to work as de lexical verbs\[Live\]  . These are commonly-used transitive verbs . 
DS's have some interesting semantic harac -teristics  . A verb can be substituted for a DS in many cases , but the substitution is one way : thus " step " for " take a step " but not " take a move " for " move "\[ Live\]  . The verb-substitutable DS's choose one of possibly several word senses of the corresponding verb except when they are metaphoric  . The selection is controlled by the cooccuring DV . Thus the same deverbal noun can form DS's which represent different meanings  . 
make an order ==> request for supply of goods give an order ==> command The DS's give a greater colloquial\[Konishi \] and euphemistic impression\[Yamanashi \] than the corresponding verb expressions and used frequently in modern English\[Live\]  . 
Another feature of a DS is that it gives the impression that the event is brief  . '
She gave a scream . ( brief )
She screamed . ( not brief )\ [ Collins \]
Some syntactic operations are possible on DS's . For example , adjectives and possessive pronouns can modify the deverbal noun  , and some DS's can be used in passive forms . 
In this paper , determiners are mainly considered as the modifier of the deverbal noun since they are the basic modifier of the DS's  . The verbs " take , "" make , "" have , " and " give " are studied since these are the most common DV's  . 
As a result , we are able to obtain a DS in the following form :
DV+(det ) + NV(1)0: optional
DV : Delexieal Verb ( take , make , have , give ) det : a , an , the
NV : Deverbal noun 3 Categorization of DS's The previous section mentioned that a DS chooses a single sense of the corresponding verb  . An example is shown in figure 1 . 
DS ~ C give all answer ) answer ( verb ) 1 say , write or do something in response to somebody 2 be suitable for

Figure 1Word sense selection
Since a deverbal noun in a DS possesses some nominal sense of the matching verb  , we can assume that a DS chooses a single sense of the deverbal noun and verbalizes it as shown in figure  2  . 
We term this kind of DS an ordinary DS . ADS which cannot select any sense for a deverbal noun is termed an idiomatic DS  . 
An ordinary DS can further be categorized into a type1 DS or a type2 DS . ADS which verbalizes the primary meaning of a deverbal Ac'rEs DE  COLING-92  , NAN'I'ES , 2328 AOt ~ T1992568 PROC . OFCOLING-92 . NANTES . AO ~ .  2328, 1992

type1 DS ordinary DS/FL type2DS
DSL idiomatic DS
Figure 3 Categorization of DS's 4 Translation strategy This section describes the basic strategy of DS translation  . A concrete implementation will be described in section  6  . 
4 . 1 Parallels between Japanese and English The DS categorization isection three was based on the selection of word senses for an English deverbal nouns  . In many cases , we can assume parallels between English and Japanese:  ( 1 ) The word sense of an English deverbal mmn can be translated into a Japanese word sense of a deverbal noun  . 
(2 ) The verbalization of an English word sense in a deverbal noun and the verbalization of the corresponding Japanese equivalent can represent the same meaning  . 
4.2 Type1 DS
Taking advantage of these parallels , the translation of a type1 DS can be achieved by verbalizing the core Japanese translation of the deverbal noun in a translation lexicon  . 
As we can see from the table in \[ Live\] , type-IDS's are predominant . This justifies the use of type1 as the default translation of unknown

As most of this type can be used passively , and since deverbal nouns of this type are sometimes modified by adjectives and possessive pronouns  , the translation mechanism should also allow the same degree of flexibility  . 
4.3 Type 2DS
This type can be translate diu approximately the same way as type-l  . However , one difference is that this type verbalizes the peripheral Japanese translation i the lexicon  . Since insufficient knowledge has been accrued on what makes the DS selec the peripheral meaning  , the collocation of DV's and deverbal nouns should be specified in a lexicon  . As this type also permits some modification and allows passive transfommtion  , it should be translated by synthetic approach . 
4.4 Idiomatic DS translation
This type does not verbalize any translation of the deverbal noun and is " frozen " in that the deverbal nouns are rarely modified by adjectives and the DS does not allow passive transformation  . This type of DS must be listed in a lexicon in its full form with a proper translation  . The implied definition of an idiomatic DS here is  ( 1 ) it does not represent any word sense of individual components and  ( 2 ) it resists any form of transformation . 
5 Passivization rules
Some DS's can be substituted with a matching passive verb as shown in \[ Live\]  , so that " take comfort " and " take counsel " can be paraphrased as " be comt ' orted " and " be counseled  , " respectively . Though the number of such cases does not seem to be large  , it is important to translate them passively , otherwise the meaning of the translation is totally reversed  . Most DS's which can be substituted by passive verbs should be translated in a passive sense in Japanese because of the parallels between the two languages  . " Take comfort " and " take counsel " should thus be translated " nagusamerareru " and " jyogen wo sareru  . " In this section , some rules to tpassiviza fion arc obtained by analyzing the\[Live\]table  . 
Conditions for these rules will be sought in the syntactic and semantic haracteristics of botb the DV and the deverbal noun  . 
Table 1 is extracted from the table in\[Live\]listing the combinations requiring passive substitution  . 
5 . 1 Condition for DV " Take " and " have " have about  10 passive verb substitutable DS's , whereas " make " and " give " have only one . This suggests that conditions depend on the contrasting characteristics ACRESDE  COLING-92  .

"" Take " and " have " have a common characteristic : the action moves from the object to the subject  . 
With " make " and " give , " on the other hand , the action moves from the subject othe object . 
The characteristics of the take-have type seems to be the DV condition  . Actually , we can see some hyponyms of take-have type forming passive verb substitutable DS's : 
I received encouragement from my friends . -~> I was encouraged by my fiiends .

Figure 4Pass vization condition for DV's 5 . 2 Conditions for deverbal nouns To consider the conditions for a deverbal noun  , formula ( 1 ) has been elaborated onto include a subject . 
Sub+DVr+(det)+NV(2)
Sub : Subject
DVr : De lexical verb requiring passive substitution  ( take , have )   1 Constraints on deverbal noun such as the determiner and the number are omitted  . 
As the deverbal nouns in Table 1 are derived from transitive verbs , we can picture a subject+verb+object structure for them  . 
X + Vt + Y (3)
X : Subject
Vt : Original Transitive Verb of the

Y : Object
Passive verb substitution occurs when the
Subin(2) agrees with Y in (3).
He gave advice . He took advice.
A ~ .....
X advised Y X advised Y
Figure 5Agreement between Y and Sub
The conditions which make Y in ( 3 ) agree with Subin ( 2 ) can be found in the syntactic and semantic haracteristics of the verb Vt  . 
" Transitive " is one of the conditions mentioned previously  . This is not , however , sufficient as some transitive verb derivative nouns do not require passive verb substitution  . 
Some examples are shown in the table 2.
Table 2 Combinations which constitute active verb substitutable DS's\[Live\]t 
DV's take approach , average , bet , command , count , dare , dislike , etc . 
DV's have approach , array , battle , bet , catch , change , claim , command , debate , desire , dislike , display , dispute , doubt , dread , etc . 
The deverbal nouns in Table 1 are a confined subset of Table 2  . A common structure seen in the verbs in Table 1 is:
X < HUMAN > + Vt + Y < HUMAN > ( 4 ) <>: Semantic Categorization while many verbs in Table  2 allow both < HUMAN > and < INANIMATE > in the object slot  . Furthermore , the verbs in Table 1 expect some change or action in the object < HUMAN > while the verbs in Table  2 do not . The expected change or action is up to the will of the object < HUMAN >  . 
X < HUMAN >+ Vt+Y < HUMAN > --> action , change ( 5 ) Verbs of this kind generally mean " demand , "" request , "" order , " and " permission " which have often been studied as " perlocutionary acts  . " In fact , we found that some nouns derived from verbs in the " perlocutionary act " group AcrEs DE  COLING-92  . NANTES . 2328 Ao~q "1992570 PROC . ol : COLING-92 . NANTES . AOO .  2328 .   1992 \[ Yamanashi \] formed passive verb substitutable

=> Ted was exempted fl'om ...

Over work apparently lmstened his death , because he continued to work hard , although e had had warning of his illness . 
=> ... had been warned ...

Formula (5) has some variations . When the subject slot is identical to the object slot  , the verb becomes reflexive , thus the interpretation of ( 5 ) is : the subject expects him/herself to be affected by the action of the verb  . 
obligate 1 have an obligation to suh in it a report to the company once a week  . 
=> I obligate myself to submit a . . . 2=> I am obliged to submit a . . . 

The coach took the blame for the poor performance of his team and resigned  . 
=> The coacb blamed himself for the ...
=> The coach was blamed lor the ...

The variation even allows replacement of < HUMAN > in  ( 5 ) with < INANIMATE > , which should be regzu'ded as a metaphoric variation of  ( 5 )  . For example , " take shape " is classified as a passive verb substitutable DS  , 3 thus : My idea took shape . => My idea was shaped . 
The variation of (5) can be seen in the following :
X < ItUMAN , INANIMATE > shaped my idea < INANIMATE > --> action  , change In summary , the deverbal noun conditions concerning passive verb substitutable DS's are:  ( 1 ) deverbal nouns are derived from transitive verbs , (2) verbs take human subjects and objects , and ( 3 ) objects are expected to c bange as the 2 This is not imtural but is used to reveal the underlying relationship  . 
3 The authors think " The idea shaped up " is also another possible paraphrase  . Here we followed the table in \[ Livel result of the action implied by the verb  . 
Condition ( 3 ) can be discussed from the viewpoint of transitivity  . Since the effect on the object is strong , strong transitivity occurs \[ I kegami \] . However , the result of the effect is not always certain and is up to the will of the object < HUMAN >  . 
6 Implementation
DS translation mechanisms were imple-nlented in an English to Japanese machine translation system \[ Aizawa \]\[ Tanaka \] bsed on the discussions in sections  4 and 5  . 
This mechanism works after the parser has fixed the " verb+object " relationship between the I  ) V and the deverbal noun . The new translation selection mechanism was implemented by adding some leatures to the existing translation selection mechanism through the use of semantic markers  . 
(1) Idiomatic DS
An idiomatic DS is listed in the translation lexicou as it is with its Japanese translation  . 
(2) Type 2DS
Among translations of a deverbal noun , if a peripheral translation is selected by a certain DV  , the type2 marker and the cooccuring DV are specified in the marker field of the translation  . T be translation will be verbalized when the deverbal noun coooccurs with the DV specified in the marker field  . 
(3) Type-1DS
For all deverbal nouns , the core translation will be given a type1 marker . When a DS does not clloose an idiomatic DS or a type2 DS , the translation w it ba type1 marker will be verb a Pized . 
An exmnple of type- 1 and type2 markers are shown in figure 6  . The two translations of " exception " can be properly chosen by the description  . 
(4) Passivizationile
The translation of a deverbal noun which satisfies the three conditions mentioned in section  5 requires a passivization marker in addition to a type-Ior  type2 marker . When they cooccur with either " have " or " take , " the translation will be verbalized in the passive voice  . 
(5) Verbalization
Most of the Japanese translations of English deverbal nouns are so called " sahen-meishi  . " Verbalization is done by simply adding " wo suru " to the tail for the active sense and " wo sareru " for the passive sense  . This is realized ACRESDE COLING-92 , NANTES , 2328^o (; r1992571Pn(~c , ol ; COLING-92 , NAN ' rraS , AUG .  2328 .  1992  .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .

An example lexical description for passivization and verbalization are shown in figure  7  . 
" Take advice " and " give advice " are translated in passive and active voice respectively  . 
7 Translation Experiment
The DS's contained in the AP texts were translated using this mechanism  . Two dictionaries were compiled to test the effects of the mechanism  . In one of the dictionaries , necessary markers were ascribed to 302 deverbal nouns-appearing in\[Live\]-and 4 DV's ( take , make , have , give ) . The other dictionary had no such modifications . 
All the March 1991 AP texts which contained both the DV's and the deverbal nouns mentioned above were selected by a simple filtering of the text  . The filtered text was translated using the two dictionaries and the results were compared by human assessment  . Sentences not having a " verb-object " relationship between the DV and deverbal noun were rejected  . The results are shown in Table 4 .

In Case 3 , the DS correctly translated " take the lead " using " riidowosuru  ( goahead of ) " while the original system produced " namari wo to ru  ( pick up a piece of them et al lead )  . " The revised mechanism thus successfully distinguished the ambiguity in the word sense of " lead  . " In Case 4 , the passive verb substitutable DS " took some encouragement  , " in which the deverbal noun is modified by " some  , " was successfully translated passively into Japanese  . 
In the example which was made worse , " give an impression " was translated into " in shouwoshite  , " which is worse than " in shouwoata et e . " This is due to the simple verbalization mechanism which attaches " suru " to all nouns backed up by heuristics  . The transitive verb form of the Japanese word " in shou  ( impression ) " is " in shouzu keru . " Further elaboration of the verbalization mechanism  , such as the use of a noun/verb conversion table , will solve this problem . 
The quality of the translation was improved remarkably  , though the translation mechanism was quite simple . 
8 Conclusions
A method has been proposed for translating English delexical verb structures into Japanese  . 
Since this method involves rule-based synthesis , transformed and modified DS's were flexibly translated  . The conditions which require a DS"passive verb substitution " were factored out and included in the translation rule  . 
The feasibility of this method was tested by translating AP news texts  , which sbowed a remarkable improvement in the quality of translation  , with a correct rate of nearly 100% . 
To achieve better esults , precise verbalizations of Japanese nouns are required  , though a simpler method worked well due to the ability to express many " verbal nouns " as " sahen-meishi " in Japanese  . 
A voice control rule was developed based on the " flow of action " of delexical verbs and the " transitivity " of deverbal nouns  ( the original verb )  . Other delexical verbs such as , " put , "" cast , " receive , " etc , can also be categorized by " flow of action " and can be integrated into t be same framework to cover a wider range of DS translations  . 
The role of the other DS components , articles , possessive pronouns , and prepositions should also be explored . 
The differences between " make " and " give , " and " take " and " have " has been neglected in this rule  . However the differences between " take " and " have " in certain contexts have been pointed out by\[Wierzbicka\]  . It would be interesting to explore these differences in the context of translation  .
