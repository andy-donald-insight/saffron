THELEXICON : ASYSTEMOF MATRICE SOFLEXICAL UNITSAND

Harry H . Josselson-
Uriel Weinreich / I / ~ in discussing the fact that at one 
time many American scholars relied on either the discipline of psychology or sociology for the resolution of semantic problems ~ comments : In Soviet lexicology  , it seems , neither the tra-ditionalists ~ who have been content to work with the categories of c lassical rhetoric and  19th-century historical semantics ~ nor the critical lex icologists in search of better conceptual tools  , have ever found reason to doubt that linguist ics alone is centrally responsible for the investiga-tion of the vocabulary of languages  .   /2/ This paper deals with a certain conceptual tool  , the matrix , which linguists can use for organizing a lexicon to insure that words will be described  ( coded ) with consistency , that is ~ to insure that questions which have been asked about certain words will be asked for all words in the same class  , regardless of the fact that they may be more dif ficult to answer for some than for others  . The paper will also dis-cuss certain new categories ~ beyond those of classical rhetoric ~ which have been introduced into lexicology  . 
i . INTRODUCTION
The research in automatic translation brought about by the introduction of computers into the technology has ~ The research described herein hasb & en supported by the In-formation Systems Branch of the Office of Naval Research  . 
The present work is an amplification of a paper ~" The Lexicon : A Matri ~ of Le~emes and Their Properties " ~ contributed to the Conference on Mathematical Linguistics at Budapest-Balatonsza-badi  , September 6-i0~1968 . 
-i-engendered a change in linguistic thinking , techniques , and " output . The essence of this change is that vague general-izations cast into such phrases as ' words which have this general meaning are often encountered in these and similar structures ' have been replaced by the precise definition of rules and the enumeration of complete sets of words defined by a given property  . Whe reasonce it was acceptable to say ( e . g . , about Russian ) that ' certain short forms which are modals tend to governa  UTO6~ clause ' , now it is required that : ( a ) the term ' modal ' be defined , either bY criteria so precise that any modal could be easily identified  , or if that is not possible , by a list containing all of the modals of the language  , and ( b ) the ' certain short forms which are modals ' which actually do governa UTOOM clause bel ikewise identified  , either by precise criteria , or by a list . 
Linguistic research into Russian has led to and will continue to yield many discoveries about the language  , and the problem of recording and recalling the content of these discoveries is not trivial  . A system is required to organize the information which has been ascertained  , so that this information can be conveniently retrieved when it is required  ; such a system is realized as a lexicon . 
Fillmore /3/ has defined a lexicon as follows : I conceive of a lexicon as a list of minimally redundant descr iptions of the syntactic  , semantic , and phonological properties of lexical items , accompanied by a system ot redundancy rules , the latter conceivable as a set Of instructions on how to interpret the lexical entries  . 
-22. DESCRIPTION OF THELEXICON
The steps in the construction of a lexicon may be de-tailed as follows : a  ) deciding which words to enter , i . e . , the lexical stock b ) deciding what are the subsets of the le?ical stock c  ) deciding what information to code about each subset d  ) compiling the information e ) structuring the storage of the information where the steps outlined have interdependencies  . We shall discuss each of the steps , especially in relation to the
Russian language.
a ) The Lexical Stock
Ideally a Russian lexicon should contain all of the words in the Russian language  , but ' all Russian words ' is a set whose contents are not universally agreed upon  , since some words are gradually dropped from usage  , while others are continually being formed and added to the lexical stock  . The words to be entered in the lexicon could be obtained from existing sources  , i . e .   , lexicons and technical dictionaries , and be supplemented by neologisms found in writ ten works  . 
The lexicographer must also be alert for new meanings and contexts in which ' old ' words may appear  . 
b ) Subsets of the Lexical Stock
The lexical stock of Russian may be subdivided into word classes  , i . e . , words having certain properties in common . 
These properties may be morphological and/or functional  . In Russian ~ nouns are not marked for tense and predicatives  -3-are not marked for the property of animateness ; hence they are in different word classes . The subsets may coincide with those of tradit i on algram_mar  , or they may be different if the grammar to which the lexicographer refers is not the tradit i on alone  . 
c ) Information to be Coded
The choice of information to be coded in a part icular lexicon is a function of its intended use -- in other words  , one should code the information that will be necessary for a particular purpose or set of purposes  , or information that has a for seeable application . For example , one of the tasks for the Wayne State University Machine Translation group was to program a routine to group each nominal in a Russian sentence with its preceding  ( dependent ) modifiers . This procedure , called blocking , requires that the computer-stored lexicon conta in I  ) word class information for identifying nominals and modifiers  , as well as conjunctions , punctuation , and adverbs intervening between the modifiers , and other word classes , tokens of which mark the boundaries of a block ; and 2) case , number , and gender information for esta-blishing an agreement relation between the nominal and the preceding modifiers  . 
Most existing Russian lexicons contain the usual morphological information for members of inf lected word classes : person  , gender , number , case , animation , paradigm , aspect , etc . . Cer ta in syntactic informat ion such as impersonality  -4-and government of cases , prepositions , the infinitive , and clauses , is indicated for verbal word classes . This indica-tion may be explicit or sometimes only implicit in an example  ; it is not consistent . It is not unusual to chance upon one of the complements of a certain predicative under the entry head of another predicative for which the example is given  . In the Academy of Sciences dictionary / 4/ , the entry head ~ eaenm ~ contains the example CTaao BA pyF  06~AHO MAocaAHO , qTOHp MxoA MT CHM FpaT ~ TaKy ~ He ~ eny ~ pooh . In the same lexicon ~ under OOMAH ~ , the form OOMBHO is shown to governaq TO clause in an example  ; however , under AocaAa there is neither coding nor example to indicate that ~ ocan Ho takes a qTO clause  . 
Each lexical entry should include all of the ex isting phonological  , morphological , and syntactic information about the head word ; the discussion and presentation of this in -formation will entail the introduction of concepts from semantics and stylistics  . When using a Russian lexicon , one should be able to discover whether ~ OmHO is a modal  ( if the grammar of Russian uses the concept ' modal ' for the word class of which MO~HO is a member  ) by looking under the entry head MOXHO and f inding the position where the property ' modal ' is coded for that word  . Furthermore , one should be able to determine whether MOX HO takes an infinitive complement  , i whether if takes a subject , or whether if has a corresponding long form , etc . .
Since the predicate is the sentence fulcrum , i . e . , since -5-it contains the most information necessary for analysis of the structure of the sentence  , the coding of the complements of predicative words is one of the main tasks for the data input to automatic parsing of Russian sentences  . Machine translation oriented lexicographers have done a great deal of work in coding the complements of many lexemes  , especially the predicatives , in an explicit and thorough way . 
lordans kaja /5/ suggested 126 different complementation patterns to account for the " strong government " of  7000 Russian stems . She recognized that the meanings of the stems could be associated with different patterns  ; e . g . , exe~oBaTb has the fol lowing meanings with the following complements : i  ) ' to go after ' with 3a + instr . 
2)' to ensue ' with H3+gen.
3 ) ' to be guided by something ' with dative without prep  . 
She recommended that the stems with different meanings be treated as different  , and that a model be composed separately for each item  . 
Rakhmankulova /6/ has written 12 models of complements for sentences containing any often different German verbs denoting posi tion in space  , and she illustrates , in a matrix , which verbs can appear in which models . 
Machine translation groups have examined Russian texts and from them compiled lists of nominals and predicatives which take an infinitive complement or a ~ TO or qTOdH clause complement ~ and lists  , of governing modifiers with their -6-complementary structures ~ many of which are not shown in any lexicon  . The Wayne State University group has done extensive coding of the complementation of predicatives  ( verbs and short form modifiers )   , modifiers ( participles and adjectives which govern complementary structures  )  , and nouns . The group has created an auxiliary dict ionary which is structured so that every complementation pattern  ( where the pattern includes an indication of the optional presence or obligatory absence of a subject  ) associated with each predicative in the dict ionary is written out ex-plicitly  . For example , the entry for noTpe0OBaTB in this auxiliary dictionary reads as follows: 
CANSUBJECT
PATTERN ( NOM . CASE)
NUMBERBE PRESENT ? yes yes yes yes yes
NOMINALINF.
123 ace gengengen
PREP+CASE CLAUSE 12 qTOqT05 ~
E+dat~o+gen
O+genyes yes
For translation purposes , it will be necessary to indicate the translat ion  ( s ) of the predicativ ~ corresponding to each pattern  , as well as those of the prepositions and case endings in each pattern  . A language example of pattern 3   -7-is Yxeo Ko ~ oH O~y ~ H Se Fo HoTpe6oBa~M KOKO ~ OTOqHO~o-'AI-ready around midday they summoned him  %0 the police . ' , while pattern 4 is illustrated by OT~M caTe a HM~noTpe ~ ye MY . y ~ oxecTBeHHOR np a B ~ . -' Of a writer we shall artistic truth . ' The above entry may not be complete . For instance , i % does not show the entry y+gen which reflects a phrase in Smirnitsky's dictionary  /7/  ,   Tpe6oBaT5   O6%SCHeHMS y KOF0 --' to demand an explanation from some body ' , which is not shown in three Russian lexicons /8/ . Furthermore , i % can be seen that the patterns with K+da % can be extended so that that phrase is replaced by B + aCC or even by an adverbial ~ OMOR-'home '  . New information will always be added . 
One transformation a list technique is to specify a syntactic construction along with a list of  ( all of the ) lexemes which can occur in a certain position of that construction  . 
The set of lexemes which Can be tokens in a certa in position of a construction is the domain of that construction with respect to the position  . Once a . lexeme is in that domains - the pair consisting of the position and the construction becomes par % of the definition of that lexeme  . The lexeme is completely defined by all of the pairs in which it is a token  , and ideally the contents of a lexical entry would include all such pairs  . 
Fillmore /9/ has compiled a list of English verbs which take ato-phrase complement  , i . e . le ~ emes which occur in the -8-pos ition VERB of the construction SUBJ+VERB + to-phrase  . 
He is careful to point out that the to-phrase must function as the complement of the verbs on the list  ( e . g . , agree , endeavor , hope , want ) and not as a purposive adverbial phrase ( as with . ' wait'in'He waited to see her . ' where ' to ' can be replaced by ' in order to ') , since as he states , " The appearance of purpose adverbial to-phrases . .  , does not appear to be statable in terms of contextual verb type  . " /10/ This indicates that the formal construction is not always sufficient to define a property  , and that the deep structure function of the construction may have to be specified as well  . 
The fact that statements which are formally identical can have distinct deep structures is i llustrated by the following Russian language examples  , which are not only formally identical , but identical in content except for one word :
N~TB qe ~ oBe ~6 H~o BH 0pa Ho Ha MM.
Five persons were elected by us.
N~TB qeao Be~6~o B ~ Opa Ho ~ eae Fa Ta MM.
Five persons were elected as delegates/by the delegates  . 
BSTB qe~oBeE6 N~o BH6 pa Hope ~ epe H~y MoM.
Five persons were elected by referendum.
In the first example , the ( pro ) noun in the instrumental case is the subject of the active transform i 
MMBH Opaa MHHT Bqeao BeK.
We elected five persons.
while in the second example , first interpretation , the in--9 -strumental noun remains in the instrumental case in the active transform  , where ( X ) stands for some subject : ( X ) B ~ pa a M n ~ T ~ q e a 0 B e K ~ e a e F a T a ~ M . 
( X ) elected five people as delegates.
The instrumental noun in the third sentence also remains in the instrumental case in the active transform  , but is shown to have a different function from the noun in the second sentence by the fact that it is possible  , albeit notelegant , to say NHT5 ueao BeEO Nao BNO pa Ho ~ era TaMMpe Cepe H~y MoM . 
Five people were elected as delegates by referendum  . 
and correspondingly ( X ) BH ~ paa MnST bqeao Be K ~ eae Fa TaMMpe ~ epeH ~ yMOM . "  ( X ) elected five people as delegates by referendum . , i . e . both words can coexist in a sentence . 
Kiefer/i \]/ has shown for Hungarian that the meaning of the verb can change within a given construction when the definition of the construction is formal and does not consider semantic properties of the components  . 
Penz vannala.
He has money on him.
is contrasted with

Peter van n ~ la.
Peter is with him.
where the animate status of the subject dist inguishes the possessive and locational meanings  . 
Lehiste /12/ has shown that the distinction between ' being ' and ' having ' in Estonian is one of di fferent complements taken  , underspecial conditions , by the same verb . 


Isa ~ on raamat.

Laualon raamat.
On the table is ( a ) book .
are structurally identical , since morphologically isal and laualare both in the a dessive case and raamatis in the nominative case  , when functional ( semantic ) case names are used , is alisdative and laualislocative , while raama ___ . ___~t is in both sentences in the objective case . 
As researchers work in the area of discovering and codifying syntactic properties  , they find out that semantic considerations are impossible to avoid  . Much of the new work in lexieology involves the analysis of predicates and their arguments  ( i . e . , subjects , and complements such as clauses , noun/adjective phrases , and prepositional phrases ) . 
The transition from purely syntactic coding ( i . e . , specifying the complements and their morphological cases if applicable  ) to semantic coding has been made by Fillmore /13/ with his grammatical cases ( e . g . , agent , instrument , object ) . 
d ) Compiling the Information
Compiling a dictionary entails discovering facts about a language and arranging these facts in such a way that they may be conveniently retrieved  . The , key factor is that once a statement is made about a certain member of a word Class  , all the other menbers of that class must be coded for the way that statement applies to them  . If the statement is "%- ii -? irrelevant for certain members  , it may be desirable to create a new word class for the latter  . 
A lexicon without lacunae can be compiled by the following procedure : For each word class construct a matrix such that each column head is a bit of information pertinent to this class  , and the row heads are all of the words in this class  . 
Each intersection must be filled with some code indicating whether or not the word has the property  , and the codes of the properties must be such that they allow the entire spec-trma of poss ible answers  . For example , since the Russian CH poxa-'orphan'-can be feminine or masculine  , the gender code must include also combin at ions of the basic components  ( masculine , feminine , and neuter ) ; since the Russian ~ Hdx ~ epe ~ Hpos a Tb--'to di fferentiate '- is both perfective and imperfective  , the code for aspect must comprise entries fo r ' perfective '  , ' imperfective ' , and ' both ' . When a verb is marked ' both ' , it may be desirable to specify the dis- tribution of the aspects over meaning and/or tenses  . 
This matrix format forces the lexicographer to commit himself about the way each property appl ies to each member of the word class  . It precludes the old-fashioned quasi-coding , where the lexicographer coded what he knew and omitted what he did not know or had never thought to consider  . In some Russian lexicons , certain nouns were coded for having no plural , but the absence of this coding in other entries did not necessarily imply that they did have a  -12-plural   ; the only inference that could be drawn was that most nouns not coded for having no plural did indeed have one  , but this information is not meaningful when def in ite information about a particular entry is required  . 
When using the matrix format , with its demands for consistency , one faces the problem of how to get the informat ion to fill its intersections  . Naturally , if the information is already in a dictionary , or if the lexicographer has an example , from some text , of the phenomenon to be coded , there is no problem in filling the intersect ion  . However , if the example is lacking , this is not always sufficient ground for cod ing the non-existence of the property  . Sometimes ~ despite the absence of an example , the lexicographer feels that the property holds , and he may consult with a native informant , using the caution offered by Zellig Harris /14/: If the linguist has in his corpus ax , bx , but not cx ( where a , b , care elements with general distributional similarity  ) 9 he may wish to check with the informant as to whether cx occurs at all  . 
The eliciting of forms from an informant has to be planned with care because of suggestibil ity in certain interpersonal and intercultural re-lations and because it may not always be possible for the informant to say whether a form which is proposed by the linguist occurs in his language  . 
Rather than constructing a form cx and asking the informant ' Do you say cx ?' or the like  , the linguist can in most cases ask questions which should lead the informant to use cx if the form occurs in the informant's speech  . At its most innocent , eliciting consists of devising situa-t ions in which the form in question is likely to occur in the informant's speech  . 
Work at Wayne State University on the complementation of certain Russian-of orms by qTO/qTOO~clauses  /15/   sup--13-ports Harris ' observation . The difficulties of working with a native informant became evident when  , on different occasions the native accepted and then rejected certain constructions  . 
Sometimes the acceptance depended on the construct ion of contexts which eluded the native on the second perusal  . 
The matrix approach is currently being used in Russian lexicon research at Wayne State University  , Where the information in the Academy dictionary /16/ and in Ushakov /17/ is being coded . ~ The omissions and inconsistencies of presenting lexical information in the lexicons are discussed in a paper by Alexander Vitek  /18/  . Grammatical profiles have been produced for all Russian substantives  , adjectives , and verbs , including their derivative participles and gerunds  . The profiles contain primarily morphological properties  , but some syntactic coding , mainly of comple-mentation patterns , has also been started . 
A sample of the coding format developed for Russian verbs  ( in Ushakov ) in this research appears in Figures 1 and 2 . 
In Figure I , the coding form for Russian verb morphology , separate fields are denoted by a single slash mark  . 
Each field has codes for certain morphological properties of the Russian verb  . The following chart explains the codes for the verb ~ OOHT ~-' to obtain '  , which appears on the first line of Figure i .

Government Cod__.~e for ~ ObblTb
Field Code Mean in ~ 1   02110 This entry has two Arabic numeral divisions in the lexicon  ; a general government marker precedes the first Arabic numeral  ; there are language examples given in the lexicon ; the entry is not a-cA verb .

3  O0 There is no government indicated under Arabic numeral#i  . 
4  O0 There is no government indicated under Arabic numeral  #2  . 
5  R1 The entry contains a cross-reference to some other verb  . 
e ) Structuring the Storage of the Information There are many ways of storing the words of a language  . 
With respect to sequencing , alphabetical order is the most popular method , although reverse dictionaries exist , and dictionaries where words are sequenced by their length and only alphabetized within a given word length  , or where word class is the primary division , are conceivable . With respect to the entry heads , they can be stems , canonical forms , or all of the forms that exist in the language . Note that a canonical form could be a particular form of a paradigm such as the masculine singular form of an adjective or the infinit ive form of a verb  , or it could be a certain verb from which other verbs are derived by certain rules  . Binnick /19/ has illustrated the latter by suggesting that be could be an entry head having  , as part of its contents , ~ and -18-make which are the causative forms of the locational and existential meanings  , respectively , of be . Fillmore /20/ has mentioned that strike and touchdiffer pr imarily only in relative intensity of impact  . It is interesting to note that Hebrew has for some verbs a basic form which is Conjugated through seven ' constructions '  , two of which are labeled'causative ' and ' intensive '  . 
A lexicon whose entry heads are stems or canonical forms has the advantage of compactness and the advantage that the whole paradigm associated with these forms is in- 
Idicated . It has the disadvantage that the user must know the rules of derivation in order to lookup words which are not in canonical form  . If every form in the language is an entry head , then the lexicon is much longer , but the homographic properties of the word are conveniently recorded  ; one might never realize , using a canonical for lexicon , that cea is both the past tense of OeCT~-'to sit down ' - and the genitive plural of ce~o-' village '-~ but this property would be immediate ly evident if tea were an entry head  . 
In the Wayne State University machine translat i on research  , Russian text to be translated or analyzed is ' read in ' one sentence at a time  ; starting from left to right , segments of the sentence are ' looked up ' in order to obtain whatever information about them has been stdred in the machine translat i on lexicon  . The minimum segment is one word ; the maximum segment is an entire sentence ~ no segment is  fermi--19-nated inside a ~ ord . The entry heads of the lexicon were designed to correspond to the segments  , and therefore are ~ rds or sequences of words ( idioms )  . The entry heads could be canonical forms or stems  , but this would require automatic procedures for t rans forming any inflected form into its canonical form  , and for finding the stem of any form in text . 
Space can be saved in a fullform lexicon by enter ing only once ~ perhaps under the canonical form  , the information which all members of a paradigm share  9 and cross referencing this information under the related entry heads  . In the Wayne State University machine translat i on research ~ sets of complementation patterns are stored in an auxiliary dictionary and any set can be referenced by any verbal form  . 
The sequence of entry heads in the lexicon is alphabetical  , since the shape of the text word to be looked up is its only identification  . Naturally , if the set of Russian words could be put into a one-to-one correspondence with some subset of the positive integers by a function whose value on any word in its domain could be determined only by information de-ducible from the graphemic structure of that word ~ then the entry heads of the lexicon would not have to be in alphabetici order  ; in this case , the lookup would be simpler and faster , since the entries could be randomly accessed . 
The number of columns in the matrix of any word class should be without limit so that new information can be entered  . Similarly , the number of rows should be without -20-l imit to allow additions as the lexical stock of the language grows  . 
3. coNCLusION
Lexical information is the consummation and thereby also the obviation of research through grammars and articles which di scuss certain questions and present a few examples of lexi-calitems which have cer tain properties  . A lexicon must reflect the grammatical sys tem used to describe the language ~ and i % shou ld carry the system through to every lexical item in the language  . It is clear that the matrix format is the only one which will insure consistency and completeness  . 
This formatise minently machinable and thereby convenient for the retrieval of l is ts of all words in the language which have a certain property  .
