0 . i . As far as the present writer is aware , the Yu~o-s-~avSerbo-Croat/English Contrastive Analysis Project ' is the first contrast lve analysis effort to use a large corpus of parallel texts  . The corpus is made up of the Brown Corpus ( reduced by 50% ) with its Serbo-Croat translation , and a smaller Control Corpus ( Serbo-Croat originals and English translation )  . A total , thus , of twice 500 , 000 words plus twice 150 , 000 words , or a grand total of some 1 , 300 , 000 words of running text . 
0 . 2 . The Project , let us make it clear , is not exclusively based on this corpus . Compilation and confron-tation of grammatical statements by various authors  , plus plain old intuition , figure prominently in the methodology . The insistence on a large corpus , however , is due to the conviction , prevailing among the Project workers , that only an extensive investigation of correspondences  ( original-language elements and their translations  ) can adequately revealtheless predictable patterns which ten ~ to have a considerable contrastive analysis potential  . 
0 . 21 . The most productive method of obtaining correspondences from our corpus is to concordance separately its Serbo-Croat and English parts  , then to merge the resulting KWIC concordances into a contrastive KWIC concordance  ( with English keywords and alternating English and Serbo-Croatlines  )  . For the more promising patterns , the merging procedure will be used twice , with both English and Serbo-
Croatkey words.
0 . 22 . In view of the size of the corpus , and the extensive concordancing required as a major procedure in the Project  , the need for computer processing is obvious . It requires noun duestrain on imagination to realize the soul-numbing effect of sheer physical handling of this mass of text if written out on slips  . 
Even in its most efficient and flexible form of a manual concordance  ( a sentence-slip file with keywords underlined monolingually  )  , without which no manual pairing of correspondences is possible  , the manual handling of this 1 , 300 , O 00-word corpus calls for as taggering amount of time and effort to prepare  . According to our careful estimate , a total of 7 , 1 00 man-hours is required to make such a concordance ( without the 1 , 9 00 hours of translation from English to Sarbo-Croat , and vice versa ) . 
0 . 23 . The slip file thus obtained would , however , secure only a one-way approach : either from English or Serbo-Croat  . A slip-file allowing a two-way approach would require an additional effort of at least  4  , 500 man-hours . 
0 . 24 . Finally , even these two manual concordances would still leave unfilled the need for reverse concordancing  , go important for morphosyntactic research . To meet this need , two additional ( though lessample ) slip files would i ~ ave to be established . 
1 . 0____~ . In view of all this , the Yugoslav Serbo-Croat/English Contrastive Analysis Project has from the outset linked the planning of its work to the services of a local computer  , the City of Zagreb IBM 360/30 machine ~1 . 1 . ._~ . StaF . e1 of computer processing . The tape with the full text of the Brown Corpus ( purchased from Brown University , ~ rovidence , R . l . , U . S . ~ . ) , which had been prepared on an IBM 7090 machine , had first to be converted from the density of 800 ~' I to 1  , 600 BPI , required by the
Zagreb computer.
1 . ?~__ . ._:_ . After this , a print out Of the entire text was obtained on the Zagrebmachine  . The printing took about eight hours , with a special program ~ restructuring the original format of the Brown Corpus text  . This program left out the location-marker column on the right hand margin of print out ~  , and added a sequence of sentence numbers ( from 00001 to 52533 ) on the left . 
1 . 12 . The full text of the Brown Corpus was now reduced hy  50%  , retaining , however , as closely as possible , the s~Lme proportions of the 15 genres ( styles ) contained in the Corpus . 
Printouts of the samples retained in this reduced version were then sent out to reliable translators  , selected to be representative of the three major regional variants of Serbo-Croat  ( western , central and eastern ) . 
Their instructions were to translate at normal speed  , and as carefully as when they do any other paid translation ~ or ~  . The only limitation imposed upon them was to observe the sentence limit in the original  ( English or , in the used for the preparation on the IBM 360/30 of a full for-w~rdEWIC concordance of the Serbo -Croat Corpus  . 
~ . ~ . St~e8 . Using the same tape , we now plan to pro-~uc~ea reverse KWIC concordance of the Serbo-Croat text  . 
Ibis concordance will be selective in the same sense that the English reverse concordance was  ( cf . Stage 4) . 
Sta~e ~ . With the normal and reverse KWIC concord-a~ce ~ of both the English and Serbo-Croat corpora now obtained ~  , we can move on to the final stage ( s ) of central importance to the ~ roject , i . e . the merging of these mono-lingual concordances to get contrastive concordances  ( cf . 
~ ) . We have planned four such concordances , and have ~' ~ empted to illustrate them here by short simulated sam-~es  . AS at the time of writing this no concordances of the Brown Corpus text  ( either original or translation ) w ~ reavailable , the text used for these samples is the S~zbo -Croat original and its translation into English of the novel PovratakFilipa Latinovicz_a ~  ( The Return of ihilip Latinovicz ) by the contemporary Croatwriter Miro-~lav Krle ~ a .

They were not to split the English sentence into two or more Serbo-Croat sentences  , nor were they allowed to combine two or more English sentences into one Serbo-Croat sentence  . 
The reason for this was the need to secure a mechanical palr in ~ of the English  ( or Serbo-Croat ) keyword ~ marked by its sentence number , with the same-numbered , parallel , Serbo-Croat ( or English ) sentence in the two-language concordancing planned for the later Project stages  . 
1 . 2 . .__~ . Sta~e2 . A new magnetic tape will be prepared of the reduced Brown Corpus text  , and with the sentence sequence numbers interpolated  . This version will be used for all subsequent concordancing  . 
1 . 3 . Sta~e3 . Using this magnetic tape , the IBM 360/30 will new prepare a full forward EWIC concordance of the reduced Brown Corpus text ~  1  . 4 . ~ Now ( while the reduced Brown Corpus is still being translated  ) we shall use the same tape to obtain a reverse EWIC concordance of the same text  . S~nceall " function words "- such as of , had , most , those , did , etc . - were already isolated in ' ~ he-~evi-~st ~ g-~- ( in -- the forward concordance ) ? this will further reduce then ~ ass of text to be concordanced by one-half ~  1  . 5 . Sta~e5 . The Serbo-Croattrsnslation of the reduced Brown Corpus  , by now in an advanced stsge , will be copied out on a Flexow riter in batches ( as translators Rend in their types cripts )  , resulting in a paper tape . 
The same procedure can , at thiz stage , be applied to the 300 , 000 words of the Control Corpus . No time for translation has to be sets part here , since only already published English translations of Serbo-Croat origins ls are to be used  . 
1 . 6 . Sta~e6 . Although the Serbo-Cro~t paper tapes ob-~-ned in the preceding stage are immeg ~ ately computer -processable  , we shell convert them to a magnetic tape , because this medium secures an incomparably speedier proees-sing on the computer  . 
1 . 61 . We hope that stages 2 to 6 will not take more than twenty weeks ( if enough personnel can be hired simultaneously )  .

The reason why these four concordances have been presented under one processing stage  ( 9 ) is that , first , ~ e are not sure whether we can afford the computer for each of them  , and , second , we do not , at this point , know how selective each of them is going to be . A considerable reduction of the text to be concordanced can be achieved in reverse concordancing if we restrict ourselves only to word ~  , ending in a characteristic morpheme with clearly foreseeable contrastive analysis potential  ( such as - e . _dd , -l_~!-est , - in / ~ , -ness , -less , etc . in English , and-ao , - vsl , - e--~n,-sc_ . .~u , - o -~, -~ etc . in Serbo-Croat ) .  --1 . 11 . It may be pointed out here that , irrespective of how restrictive the selection of keywords for concordanc-?n~may have to be  , no concessions should be made in the principle of bilingual approach  . Only if , in our investi-6ation of the contrastive potential of individual elements  , we strictly observe the approach from both the English and the Serbo-Croat texts  , can we be certain that we shall hsve covered all possible contrastive description patterns based on correspondences in both corpora  . 
2 . 0__ . _ t . Once contrastive concordancing has been completed we shall still be facing some practical technical problems  . 
2 . 1 . Project analysts , for instance , will often have to be provided with slips instead of computer print outsheets  . 
Only if the material being analyzed is in the form of slips will they be able to classify and reclassify the key elements swiftly and flexibly  ( by putting together , breaking up and re-establishing batches of slips ) . 
2 . 11 . Cutting up the concordance print outs to get the slips is not very practical in view of the varying size of contrasted pairs of elements with their context  ( cf . n . 9, second half ) . The way around this , clearly , is to have the pairs printed out at regular intervals with sufficient blank space in between  . This , however , would probably triple the amount of print out paper required  . Also , this is complicated further by the need for a number of copies for each pair  ( slip )  , because of simultaneous demands that may often be made upon the same slip by several Project analysts  , approaching the same element from various des -criptive levels  . These copies could be secured by using special , multiple-carbon print out paper , but this might prove quite expensive . 
2 . 2 . In view of all this , the Yugoslav Serbo-Croat/English Contrastive Analysis Project has envisaged the use of a Flexow riter here as an alternative method  . This machine has already provided us with the paper tape of the Serbo-Croat translation of the reduced Brown Corpus  , plus the tapes of Serbo-Croat originals and English translations of the Control Corpus  ( cf . Stage 5) . The missing paper tape of the English text of the Brown Corpus can be obtained on a magtape-to -paper tape converter  . Once both paper tapes are ready , running them through the Flexo-writer provides us with up to  13   ( some claim 20 ) carbons of each contrasted pair . An additional advantage of using the Flexowriter for slip duplication is in the less awkward shape of slips  . Paper tapes reproduce the text in 60-character-wide lines of the original translators ' type-script , as opposed to the llOto 120-character streamers of normal computer print out ( unless the concordance print-out was programmed for a narrower format  , requiring considerably more paper ) . 
2 . 3 . The resulting slip files of sentence-numbered English and Serbo-Croat texts  , coupled with the Project's basic ( monolingual-forward and reverse ) concordances , can now be used as a replacement for contrastive concordances  . It would work approximately like this : upon receiv-&ing an analyst's request for examples of all corresponden-ces in the corpus of an element under analysis  , the Project headquarters in Zagreb would look the element up in one of the basic concordances  , record semtence numbers of all the occurrences , extracts lips bearing these numbers from the Flexow riter-produced slip file  , and forward them to the analyst for further research  .

6 . In a total reverse concordance they would only appear in a different place : of under F  , had under D , etc . 
7 . ~ uttimg the top lO0 words from the Brown CorpusRank List on the exclusion list  ( compared to a total of some 1SO " function words " , in the present author's estimate ) , would reduce the text by 47 . 4 percent , while including only one morphologically marked word  ( YEARS ) and two lexical words ( ~ iEW , TIME ) . Expanding the exclusion list to cover the top 200 words would probably not be economical ( though only two additional morphologically marked words would be included : UI~ITED and STATES  )  , because the computer would be slowed down , whereas the textual 8 . 

mass would be reduced by only 6 more percent ( to 53 . 6 percent . 
Which may take between 40 and 60 computer hours , as opposed to an estimated 2 , 350 hours of manual processing ( for only the English forward concordance at that )  . 
In addition to being simulations , all these concordance samples are in an idealized format  , with the correspondences spatially parallel to the keyword  . In practice , however , it is impossible to achieve this ideal textual parallelism  , because there are no other formal signals to governit  , except the sentence sequence number which can only mark the sentence as a whole  . 
For this reason , the actual computer concordances will , when ready , have the correspondence to the keyword printed out with the whole sentence in which it occurs  , under the single line with the keyword . This will , naturally , increase the size of the concordance , but not more than about 50 percent in our estimate . This is because only an approximate 40 percent of all sentences in the original text of the Brown Corpus are in excess of  20 words ( which can be accommodated by the average print out line  )  . Amere 6 percent of these sentences are longer than 40 words , requiring , consequently ,  : . ore than two print outlines .
