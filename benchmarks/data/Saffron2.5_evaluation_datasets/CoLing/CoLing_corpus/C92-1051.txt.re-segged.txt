Abstract
The process of finding the antecedent of zero pronoun  , that is indispensable to Japanese language understanding  , is the topic of this paper . Here we mainly concern with discourses comprising two sentences that are in a subordinate relation  , especially one of them describes the agent's volitional action and the other describes the reason of the action  . We propose basically two new principles : ( 1 ) The agent of an action should experience a certain psychological reason  ,   ( 2 ) Predicates reporting someone's psychological state are categorized into  1  ) weakly or 2 ) strongly bound to the expected point of view . Combination of these principles accounts for some problematic Japanese zero anaphora  , which cannot be accounted for by the theories o far proposed  . 
1 Introduction
Kuno said in \[7\] that in Japanese discourses we have to omit as many components in a sentence as possible unless we get any ambiguity  . In fact more components are omitted than expected in actual discourses  , because we have a rich variety of linguistic appara-tuses to be used to communicate unambiguously  . From the computational viewpoint identifying the antecedent of zero pronoun  , which is the omitted part of sentence , is really needed . For this several theories have been developed . 
Among them we first review the two most important theories in analyzing zero pro-noun's antecedent in Japanese proposed in  80's   . The first one is Centering theory in Japanese proposed by Walker et al  \[8\]  . 
Each utterance of a discourse has a set of discours entities called forward looking centers  , Cf . Cf's for one utterance are ranked according to their discourse sahence  . In Japanese Cf's are ranked in the following order of preference : 

Now we have the following constraints and rules to calculate the backward looking center  , Cb , which is regarded as the most salient discourse entity picked up from Cf's of the previous utterance  . 
Constraints and Rules
For each Ui in a discourse segment UI, . . . , U , ~1 . There is precisely one Cb . 
2 . Every dement of Cf(U ;_I ) must be realized in Ui . Notice that if the antecedent of zero pronoun in U  ; is known to be one of Cf(U ; -1) , then that Cf is regarded to be realized in Ui . 
3 . The center , Cb(Ui ) , is the highestranked element of Cf(U ; _I ) that is realized in U ;  . 
4 . If some element of Cf ( Ui_t ) is reahzed as a pronoun in U ;  , then so is Cb(U /) . 
5 . Transition states to decide Cb ( U i ) are ordered : Continuing is preferred to Retaining is preferred to  Shifting-1 is preferred to Shift-ing . These states are characterized as follows . 
Here Cp(U ~) means the highestranked Cf(Ui).
Continuing : Cb(U/_I ) = Cb(Ui ) = Cp(U/)
Retaining : Cb(U ,_I ) = Cb(Ui)#Cp(Ui)
Shifting-l:Cb(U,_t)#Cb(U ,) = Cp(U ,)
Shifting : Cb(U ;_~) #Cb(Ui)#Cp(Ui)
Actually , the antecedent of zero pronoun is determined undersatisfying all these constraints and rules  . This centering mechanism can account for a very broad range of Japanese zero pronoun anaphora  . Almost the same centering mechanism applies to Italian pronominal system successfully  \[2\]  . 
Acr ~ DBCOLING-92 , NANTES , 2328 AOl3"r1992324 PROC . OFCOLING-92, NANTES , AU ~ .  2328 ,   1992 Another important theory is Property sharing theory proposed by Kamey ama  \[4  ,  5\] . Her theory concerns the interaction between Cb and zero pronouns  . Consider adjacent ut-termaces or a sentence including a subordinated clause  . Two zero pronouns appearing distinct utterances or clauses can retain the same Cb if they share one of the following properties :  1  ) IDENT-SUBJECT , 2) IDENT alone , 3) SUBJECT alone , 4) bott , non-
IDENT and non-SUBJECT , 5) non-IDENT only , 6) non-SUBJ only , where the descending order means preference , and IDENT is almost the same as , or very near , the empathy proposed by Kuno\[7\] . Although these theories cover a fairly large part of Japanese zero anaphora resolution  , there still remain the problematicases which can be resolved by neither of them  . In the following sections , we will focus on some of the problematic cases and show how to deal with them  . 
2 Interactions between
Ira and Kureta
We begin with the following discourse.
Alicega Bettyni (1) Alice-SUBJ Betty-DN r
Carolnokotowo
Caro I-GEN-NOM-ACC oshie-ta.
inform-PAST'A lice informed Betty about Carol . ' ~) , ~ bj Carolnoko to wo ( I ) -SUBJ Caro I-GEN-NOM-ACCs in paisi-takarada . 
bean xious-PAST because ' Because(\]) , ~bj was anxious about Carol . ' ? , ubj " ~" Alice where the last line , and henceforth , shows that the native's intuitive interpretation is that there being the only possible antecedent of the zero subject O  , , , bj , and in this case , it is Alice . Both the centering algorithm proposed by Walker et al  \[1  ,   8\] and Kameyarua's property sharing constraint \[4  ,   5\] predict Alicems a strongly preferred antecedent of tt  , e zero subject , O , ~ bj , of (1) . So , they correctly predict the native's intuition . Let's look at the case where the second sentence of  ( 1 ) is replaced with the following . 
~) , ubj Carolnoko to wo ( 2 ) ~- SUBJ Caro I-GEN-NOM-ACCs in paisite-it a karada  . 
bean xious being-PAST because ~ Beeause O ) , ,bj was being anxious about
Carol . '\[ q ~ , ,bj = Betty \] > \[~) o , bj = Alice\]where the last line of the above example  , and henceforth , indicates the native's intuition of the order of preference for antecedents of  ?0~bj in ease we have more than one possible antecedents  . 
In ( 2 ) both Alice and Betty are the possible antecedent of ?  , ~ bj , even though Betty is stronger . Both Betty and Alice can be derived by the theory in  \[8\]  . However , since Alice is subject , their theory predicts that Alice is the prinrary candidate of antecedent of/l  )  , ubj . 
This is explained by the wellknown fact that " it a "- sufllx  , which is used in the second sentence in this case  , describes the event from an outsider's point of view  , which , presumably , makes the antecedent of zero subject of " ita " -suilixed verb not be the linguistically salient expressions  , in this case , the subject of the first sentence but be some other person  . 
Therefore the zero subject ~? ~ bj tends not to corefer with the subject of the first utterance A lice which is a linguistically salient expression  . As the result #, ~ j tends to corefer with Betty . Basically this explanation comes from
Kameyama's accounts in\[4\].
Look at the discourses whose first sentences are the saute as the tlrst sentence of  ( 1 ) and second sentences are the following sentences respectively  , in which each of the second sentences describes not a psychological state but a physical action of meeting  .

' \[49? , b~=Betty\]_>\[49 , ,bj = Alice \] Nevertheless the contents described in the The second sentences are categorically different is : ones  , these two series of discourses , ay (1) (2) and (3) (4) respectively , show the similar preferences for ? , , bj . Therefore the tentative summarization of preference mechanism so far is the following  . 
Principle 1 ( Preference ( tentative))
Consider a discourse of two sentences or a complex sentence in which one of the sentence or clause describes the action taken by an agent  , and the other sentence or clause provides the reason of the action respectively  . 
i . As a default , a zero subject of one sen- ( 8 ) fence or clause that describe the reason corefers with the subject of the other sentence  ( clause ) unless there is a non subject topic in the other sentence  ( or clause )  . 
2 . When " it a "- sufflxed verb is used in one sentence or clause that describes the reason  , their zero subjects tend not to corefer with the ( topic subject of the other sentence ( or clause . 
3 Problematic
Cases , " ita-morat-ta "

Let's compare the following three discourses which consist of two sentences respectively  , and whose first sentences are common one shown as follows: 
Bettyga Aliceni (5) Betty-SUBJA lice-bAT
Carolnokotowo
Caro I-GEN-NOM-ACC oshiete-morat-ta.
inform-CAUS-PAST ' BettyiletAlice in form herl about 

The second sentence of the first discourse is : 49 , ~ bj Carolnoko to wo ( 6 )   49 -SUBJ Caro I-GEN-NOM-ACCs in paisite-it a karada . 
bean xious being-PAST because ~ Be canse 49 , ~ , j was being anxious about

feel an xiety-being-PAST because ' Because 49 , ~bj was feeling anxiety about
Carol . '49, , bj = Betty
The second sentence of the third discourse is : 49 , ~bj Kinouekide49-SUBJ yesterday station-LOC
Carolto atte-ita
Carol-OBJ meet-being-PAST karada.
because ' Because(I ) , ~ j was meeting Carol at the station yesterday . ' \[49 , ,bj = Alice \] > \[49 , ,sS = Betty \] These discourses all have the same " morat-ta " - suffixed and " ita "- suffixed verbs followed by " karada " cornbination in the first and the second sentence respectively  . In " oshie-te-morat-ta " , "( te)-morat " causativizes the verb , namely the agent of the action of asking some action to other one is the antecedent of the subject  , and , the more important point is that " morat-ta " -suffaxed verb describes the action from the subject's point of vicw  . As the result , in these discourses the empathy locus of the first sentence is Betty  . While they are almost identical in grammatical structures  , the preferred antecedents of zero subject ( I ) , ~ b . /are quite different . Therefore this difference is expected to comc from the contents of verb phrase of the second sentences  . 
First we consider the preference of zero subject based on " morat-ta "-" ita " combination  . 
Since Betty is not only the subject but also the empathy locus of the first sentence  , and " it a "- suffixed verb describes the event from the outsider's viewpoint  , namely , from non-empathy locus , A lice should be preferred as the antecedent of zero subject of the second sentence  . Although this expectation coincides with the actual preference of  ( 8 )  , it does not with that of (6) or (7) . This discrepancy cannot be explained by any syntactic theory  , ACI'E SDE COL 1NG-92 . NANTES , 2328 AOUT 1992326 PROC . OFCOLING-92, NANTES , AUa .  2328 , 1992 because (6) , (7) arid (8) , all have the identical syntactic structure . Neither the proposed centering theories\[1 ,  8 ,  4 ,   5\] nor our tentative preference principle 1 can account for this phenomena . The reason is that ( 1 ) timy use only the notions of topic , empathy , and the effect of ' Sta " and " mora t-t?'-suffix ,   ( 2 ) all these discourses are the same in these notions and suffixes  . To explain this discrepancy , hopefully , in more unified fashion in order to be able to apply the resulting theory to a variety of cases  , is the real aim of the paper . 
4 Experiencer and Agent of Action
It is cognitively reasonable to assume that when a human agentakes a volitional action it should be the case that the agent has a certain psychological reason  . This assumption is exemplified , for instance , in the following discourse . 

Johnwa \[?, ~ binu ; ga
John-TP-SB\[ ( 1 ) -SUBJ dogi-OBJ kowakat4a node \] fear-PAST because \] ~ obj , ~ oiharat-ta . 
( I ) ; -OBJ make-PAST away ' Because John feared the dog ~  , he made it laway . ' ~ , , a , = John Clearly and intuitively the antecedent of zero subject of the subordinated clause is John who is the topic subject of main clause  . 
The subject of the main clause should have the psychological reason of ir is volitional action  , oiharat(=make(I ) away , ( where = the dog )) , and the subordinated clause states that John experienced a certain fear  . 
The intuition of John being the antecedent of the zero subject supports the assumption that the agent nmst have the psychological reason  . 
In other words , the agent of his/her volitional action must be an experieneer of the psychological state which should be the reason for that action  . On the contrary in the following discourse the agent of the action  , boku(-I ) , is not identical with the experiencer of fear , say , John . Its unacceptability endorses the above assumption . 
\[ Johngainuwo ( 10 ) *\[ John-SB dog-OBJ kowakat-ta node \] boku ga fear-PAST because \] I-SUBJ ~ b ~ oi harat-ta  . 
-OBJ make-PAST away ' Because John feared the dogl  , Imadeit ; away . ' ? obj = in u ( = the dog ) However if John's fearing can be recognized by some other person through observing it  , and the agent of the action coincides with this person  , the discourse is acceptable as exemplified in the following examl  ) le . 
(11)\[ John gainulwoko wakat-ta\[John-SB dog ; -OBJ fear-PAST you-na node \] boku ga seem because \] I-SUB ~ obj  , ; oi harat-ta . 
? ; -OBJ make a way-PAST ' Be canse John seemed to fear the dog i  , Imadeit ; away . ' In this case " you-rid'used in the subordinated clause makes John's fearing  ( " kowakat-ta " ) state t ) e observed from not John but some other not yet specified person  , say , X . 
Actually after reading the main clause , we know that the . agent of the action is the malespeak cr , 1(=boku ) , and can infer that the observer X coincides with I consistently t  ) eocause Xhaznot yet had any particula refer - eat  . That is why ( l1) is acceptable . And this acceptability is accounted h ) r by the above assumption . Through the careful examination about the actual discourses  , we also confirmed that all these kind of phenomena are correctly ot  ) served even in the case that two consecutive sentences are in a subordination relation  , say , one describes an action taken by the agent att d the other gives the reason of that action  . Now we have conlirmed the assumption posed at the beginning of this section with some elaborations done in the previous lines  , so we state it ~ . s the following principle . 
Definition 1 ( Experiencer ) Ezperiencer is defined as a person who directly experiences  . certain psychological state in his/her own mind . 
AcrEsDECOL 1NG-92 , Nn ~ rrES , 2328 AOUT 1992327 Pgoc . ov COLING-92, NA/,ZFES , AUG .  2328 . 1992 Definition 2 ( Observer ) Observer is defined as a person who , from his/her point of view , recognizes some other experieneer'spy -chological state by observing that experieneer  . 
Principle 2 ( Agent is Exp . or Obs.)
Consider a discourse in which the subordinated sentence  ( or clause ) expresses a psycho-logical reason of the volitional action taken by an agent which main sentence  ( or clause ) describes . The agent who takes the volitional action should be either the experiencer or observer of the situation described in the subordinated sentence  ( or clause )  . 
This principle , superficially , seems to be a kind of common sense inference rule . However , since it comes from the very nature of human behavior so deeply  , it should be regarded as the control hueristics in cognition  . 
Now we restate the effect of " it a "- su flix in terms of this principle  . Consider the following examples . 
(12)*\ [ Billwaonakagasui-ta
Bill-TPoSB be-PAS Thungry node \] boku wabe cause \] I-SUBJ hitokireno panwoy at-ta  . 
a piece of bread-OBJ give-PAST ' Because Bill was hungry  , I gave him a piece of bread . ' This sentence is unacceptable or at most marginal because of discrepancy of the agent of action and the experiencer  . In Japanese , even if we consider an observer , he/she could not be the agent of action when the experience  , for instances being hungry or being sad , is not observable from outsiders\[6\] . However if we replace verb " sui-ta " with ira -suffixed one  , " suite-its " , shown in the following , Bill's hunger is known to be observed from other person  , in this case Boku ( = I ) who coincides with the agent of action of giving a piece of bread  . So it does not violate Principle 2 . Actually the following ( 13 ) is acceptable under this interpretation . 
\ [ Billwaonakagasuite-its ( 13 ) \ [ Bill-TP-SB be-PAST being hungry node \] Boku gabecause\]I-SB hitokirenopanwoyat-ta  . 
a piece of bread-OBJ give-PAST ' Because Bill was being hungry  , I gave him a piece of bread . ' In conclusion , ' ~ it a '- suflix makes the event be described from some outsider's point of view  . Therefore by identifying that outsider with the agent of action  , the agent becomes to be the observer of the state which is the reason of his/her vohtional action  . 
One of the important issues about Principle 2 is the relation among this principle , Kameyama's property sharing and the centering algorithm  \[8\]  . At first glance Principle 2 is exemplified linguistically by subject-empathy ( ' ident'in her term ) sharing \[5\] , or by the combination of preference for Cb ( Backward Looking Center ) continuing and CfRanking\[8\] . Actually sometimes it is the case . However Principle 2 is based on the very nature of human behavior . Therefore it generally provides more indirect explanations than their theories do  . But even in the cases their theories do not provide a correct and unique prediction  , like (6) , (7) and (8) , Principle 2 would provide a certain guideline as will be shown in the following section  . 
5 Typology of Predicates
It's time to explain the discrepancy of interpretations of  ( 6 )  , (7) and (8) noted in section 3 . 
Before mlalyzing (6) , (7) and (8) , we examine the minimal pairs of these in which non"ita "- suffixed verbs are used in the second sentences  , like the followings : (14) (15) (16) ( I ) , ubj Kinou ekide ( I ) -SUBJ yesterday station-LOC
Carol to attaka rada.
Carol-OBJ meet-PAST because ' Because ? , , bj met Carol at the station yesterday . ' ~ , ~ bj = Betty(~ , ,~ bj Carol no koto wo ( I ) -SUBJ Caro I-GEN-NOM-ACCs in paisi-takarada . 
bean xious-PAST because ' Because ? , ~ , bj was anxious about Carol . ' ~ , ubj = Betty ? , ubj Carol nokotoga ( I ) -SUBJ Carol-GEN-NOM-OBJ kininat-takarada .

' ?  , , , bj = BettyIn all cases , the antecedent of the zero subject is Betty who is the agent of ' qetting her in form " action described in the first sentence  ( 5 )  . This fact is one of the consequences derived by Principle  2  . Anyway we can regard Betty as the expected point of view  , henceforth called POV , in the second sentences , say , above shown (14) , (15) and (16) and also in previously shown (6) , (7) and (8) . As the consequence Betty is expected to be the primary candidate of antecedent of zero subject  ?  , ~ bi in all these cases . 
Now we start to examine the original cases.
First we examine (8).
Verb " au " ( meet in English) , the stem of the verb " atte " used in (8) , could describe the meeting event from the outside of the agent who is actually meeting  . In other words a meeting action is observed from the people around as well as the agent him /herself  . Frmn the first sentence ( 5 ) we know that the agent of volitional action is Betty who should have the reason of the action in the situation described by the second sentence  . In this ease the " it a "- suflix is strong enough to take the non-agent outsider's point of view  , namely Alice . As a result Alice took the meeting action and Betty was to be an observer  . Since it coincides with the intuitive preference , and this account relies on Principle 2 , we once again confirm that principle , llowever the preferences of the previously shown ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) are , at first glance , the counterexamples of the combination of Principle  2 and the linguistic force of " it a "- suttix . 
Therefore we have to try to find another reason to explain these phenomena  . We do not have any syntactic clue to explain the difference of their I  ) references , because they are syntactically almost the same . The next thing we should examine is the contents of verb phrase in the second sentences  . Through careful examining of number of verbs and so called " subjective adjectives "  1 in sentences of this type of structure , we found inductively that they are categorized into at least three groups ms the followings  . 
tFor instance , " Kmtasii " ( be sad ) is regarded as a subjective adjective in Japanese . 
Principle 3 ( Predicates Categorization ) this type . This type of verb describes a physical action which can be described easily and naturally \[ rom the point of view of anyone around the agent of this action  , of course including the agent him/her self . As the consequence , the agent of the action described by this type of verb can be interpreted fully under the control of " ita "- suJJix's force  . 
WeakPOV BoundVerb " sinpai-suru " ( beanxious ) used in ( 6 ) is of this type . This type of verb describe stile psychological state of the agent who takes a volitional action  , primarily from the expected point of view , namely that agent . However that state can be observed by other people  . As a result , it is possible to describe the agent's psychological state either from the expected current point of view or fi ' om the outside observers  . 
Strong POV Bound Verb " kininaru " ( feel anxiety ) used in ( 7 )  , socalled subjective adjectives , that express a psychological state ~ like " ureshi-i "  ( be happy )  , "kanashi-i " ( be sad , " X-wo-kanziru " ( feel
X ) where X is a noun which represents a certain psychological state  , and so on areoJ this type . This type of predicate describes an agent's inner psychological state that cannot be observed by other people  . As a result , they describe those states exclusively fi'omtile expected cur?rent point of view  , who is to be the agent of the action . 
By combining this categorization and Principle 2 we can account for the discrepancy of preference among  ( 6 )  , (7) and (8) as following . 
The preference of ( 8 ) has been already accounted for in this section , which actually uses the nature of POV Neutral Verb  , " au " . 
2The dill'create similar with that of between Weak a:nd Strong POV Bound predicates has already been observed in the context of antecedent binding through Japanese long distance reflexive ' zibun ' hiterms of three notions  , say , SOURCE , SELF and PIVOT by Iida and Sells\[3\] . Kinsui \[6\] proposes the framework that categorizes a a paalese vrbs a at d subjective adjectives into the similar types as ours  . 
Ac'll~s DECOLING-92 , NANTES , 2328 AO~"1992329 PROC . OFCOLING-92, NANTES , Air 6 . 23-28 , 1992 Notice that due to the first sentence ( 5 ) the agent of volitional action " oshie-te-morat "   ( lether in form ) is known to be Betty who should have the reason of the action in the situation described by the second sentence  ( 6 )  . By Principle 2 ( 6 ) describes Betty's experience that causes her volitional causative action " oshie-te-morat ?' As a result the antecedent of the zero subject is primarily Betty  . However since verb " sinpal-suru " ( bearudous ) of ( 6 ) is WeakPOV Hound , due to the effect of " it a "- suffix , it is also possible that nonagent , in this case Alice , is the antecedent of the zero subject . Namely , by ' ~ ita "- suffixAlice's state of being anxious ( " sinpaisuru ' ) is known to be observed by the original agent Betty  . Thus the intuitive preference is accounted for by the combination of Principle  2  , " sinpai-suru " being WeakPOV Bound , and the effect of " it a "- suffix . 
As described in the above ease , Betty is known to be the salient agent in the second sentence  ( 7 )  . However since the verb of ( 7 ) "kininaru " isStrongPOVB ound , the zero subject is exclusively the expected point of view  , namely the primarily supposed agent Betty even though the verb is " it a '- sn flixed  . 
Thus we account for native's intuitive preference systematically  . 
Intrasentential cses are also accounted for in the same fashion as we did in the discourse cases  . However we omit those due to the space limitation . 
6 Conclusions
The centering algorithms already proposed account for much broader ange of phenomena than our theory covers  . However their algorithms themselves cannot account for certain types of phenomena  , which we observe in reason-action type subordinate discourses  , etc . These cases can be dealt with by Principle 2 and predicate categorization especially Strong and WeakPOV Bound types as stated in the following principle  . 
Principle 4 In the subordinated sentence or clause whose verb describes the ezperiencer's psychological state and is WeakPOV Bound  , as . \ [ or the antecedent of zero pronoun , the non-experiencer expected by the force of " ira "- suffixed verb and by Principle ~ can override the supposed experiencer  . In eases of Strong POV Bound this overriding does not happen  . 
Incorporating with these principles , the already proposed centering theories could cover much wider zero anaphora phenomena  .
