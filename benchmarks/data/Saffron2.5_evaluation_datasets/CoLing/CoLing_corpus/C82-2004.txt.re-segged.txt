T~eJapan Information Center of Science and Technology  ( JICST )   2-5-2 NIgatao ho Chiyodak ~ Tokyo 100 Japan Japanese is a peculiar language among the thousands of languages in the world  . There exist only two of the same class ! Japanese and Korean  . Japanese is written both in Chinese characters  ( ideograph ) and in Kana ( Katakana and H Aragana-phonetlo symbols ) In mixture without any space . Moreover , 0 hi-neee characters in Japanese have , in most cases , several read-tngs and play several roles depending on the context and letter string characteristics  . So for written Japanese , it wanvery difficult to ee ~ nent lette r string and extract adequate terms from sentence and to gave them correct readings automatically  , which a ~ eind is pensable for terminology , automatic reading , automatic indexing , keyboarding from on-line terminals other- wise more than  2  , 000 character keyboard As necessary . 
The authors invented efficient algorithm and : developed computer programme and dict ionaries for successful solution of the problems above for the first time in Japan  . 
The system consists of two subsystems called K -KACS  ( Kan~i-Kana Automatic Conversion System ) and JAEAS ( Japanese
Keyword Automatic Selection).
Some Chinese characters act both as suffix , preffix or preposition and as parts of meaningful words  . We comprehensive -- 21 -ly collected such characters ( about 500 ) and those terms in Which the characters are inc luded not as fixes or prepositions but as important part  ( about 8000 words )  . Letter string which is matched with dict ionary term is passed but the letter re- mained and coincides with the special character itself is cutvIn case of longle tter string without such special lette r  , sentence is out by those terms of dictionary which are thought to be definite within reasonable amount  . That iss dogliver nucleus DN as e in definite type of word  . definite type of word . 
Equally , among the varlety of readlngs-in someoases more than  8 -some are speelel and definite and others ~ re indefinite but obey to rules  . We collected these speolal readings ( about 25 , 000) for about 2 , 0 00 Chinese characters and developed algorit ~ and progr ~ e to select the correct readlng for each Chinese character with the precision higher than  99  . 94 ~ . 
As the dlotionary is small enough and lo ~ Io is simple  , implementation and meintenanoe are relatively easy and the speedls very hlgh o JICST adopted th is system for its information file p roduction and services of more than  400  , 0 00 citations per ye ~ T and save cOS tS ? By the development of the techniques  , p ~ ocessiug of Japanese has become to be able to cope with western  lan6uages   , We were awarded for the work The Prize of Learn ing of Japan Association of Information and Documentation i  1980  , and have applied patent ( Japan Patent Koks ? Shows 55 ( 1980 )  - 102074 )  .
