Abstract
This paper describes a unified framework for biling naltext matching by combining existing handwritten bilingual dictionaries and statistical techniques  . The process of bilingual text matching consists of two major steps : sentence alignment and structural matching of bilingual sentences  . Statistical techniques are apt plied to estimate word correspondences not included in bilingual dictionaries  . Estimated word correspondences are useful for improving both sentence alignment and structural matching  . 
1 Introduction
Bilingnal ( or parallel ) texts are useful as resources of linguistic knowledge as well as in application such as machine translation  . 
One of the major approaches to analyzing bilingual texts is the statistical approach  . The statistical approach involves the following : alignment of bilingual texts at the sentence levelnsing statistical techniques  ( e . g . Brown , Lai and Mercer (1991) , Gale and Church (1993) , Chen (1993) , and Kay and RSscheisen (1993)) , statistical machine translation models ( e . g . 
Brown , Cooke , Pietra , Pietra et al (1990)) , finding characterlevel/word-level/phrase -level correspondences from bilingual texts  ( e . g . Gale and Church (1991) , Church (1993) , and Kupiec (1993)) , and word sense disambiguation for MT ( e . g . Dagan , Itai and Schwall (1991)) . In general , the statistical approach does not use existing handwritten bilingual dictionaries  , and depends solely upon statistics . For example , sentence alignment of bilingual texts are performed just by measuring sentence lengths in words or in characters  ( Brown et al , 1991; Gale and Church ,  1993) , or by statistically estimating word level correspondences  ( Chen , 1993; Kay and RSscheisen ,  1993) . 
The statistical approach analyzes unstructured sentences in bilingual texts  , and it is claimed that the results are useful enough in real application such as machine translation and word sense disambiguation  . 
However , structured bilingual sentences are undoubtedly more informative and important for future natural language researches  . Structured bilingual or multilingual corpora serve as richer sonrces for extracting linguistic knowledge  ( Klavans and Tzonkermann , 1990; Sadler and Vendelmans , 1990; Kaji , Kidaattd Morimoto , 1992; Utsuro , Matsnmoto and Nagao , 1992; Matsumoto , l . shimoto and Utsuro , 1993; Utsuro , Matsumoto and Nagao ,  1993) . Compared with the statistical approach , those works are quite different in that they use word correspondence information available in handwritten bilingual dictionaries and try to extract structured linguistic knowledge such as structured translation patterns and case frames of verbs  . For example , in Matsunloto et al (1993) , we proposed a method for finding structural matching of parallel sentences  , making use of word level similarities calculated from a bilingual dictionary and a thesaurus  . Then , those structurally matched parallel sentences are used as a source for acquiring lexical knowledge snch as verbal case frames  ( Utsuro et al , 1992; Utsuro et al ,  1993) . 
With the aim of acquiring those structnred linguistic knowledge  , this paper describes a unilied framework for bilingual text matching by combining existing handwritten bilingual dictionaries and statistical techniques  . The process of bilingual text match in 9 consists of two major steps : sentence alignment and structural matching of bilingual sentences  . In those two steps , we use word correspondence information , which is available in handwritten bilingual dictionaries  , or not included in bilingual dictionaries but estimated with statistical techniques  . 
The reasons why we take the approach of combining bilingual dictionaries and statistics are as follows : Statistical techniques are limited since  1  ) they require bilingnal texts to be long enough for extracting use fifl statistics  , while we need to acquire structured liugnistic knowledgeven from bilingual texts of about  100 sentences ,  2 ) even with bilingual texts long enough for statistical techniques  , useful statistics cannot be extracted for low frequency words  . For the reasons1) and 2) , the use of bilingual dictionaries is inevitable in our application  . On the other hand , existing handwritten bilingual dictionaries are limited in that available dictionaries are only for daily wm'ds and usually domain specific online bilingual dictionaries are not available  . Thus , statistical techniques are also inevitable for extracting domain specific word correspondence information uot included in existing bilingual dictionarie ' ~  . 
At present , we are attile starting point of combining existing bilingual dictionaries and statistical techniques  . '\[' herefore , as statistical techniquest brestimating word correspondences not included in bilingual dictionaries  , we decided to adopt techniques a . s simple as possible , rather than techniques based on complex probabilistic translation models such as in UJ a Panese  .   .   .   .   .   .   .   . text ~_ e . st_im . ,t! , )_n o f English iext _J~l parso parse * Gran l l l llr " Dictionary '  1 f\]penc ! encystrueture_j ( dependency structure J ~ .   . , l ~ WordS in lilarity ( .   .   .   . / ~\ [ ~ l ~" ~" bilingual dictionary

What we adopt are simple co-occurrence-frequency -based techlfiques in Gale and Churcl  , (1991) aa M Kay and lfi Sscheisen (1993) . 
As techniques for sentence ; flignment , we . adopt also quite a simple method based- . on the number of word correspondence . % without ~ tny probabilistic translation models . 
in the following sections , we illustrate the specifications of our bilingual text nlatehing fl ' alne work  . 
2 The Framework of Bilingual
Text Matching
The overall framework of bilingual text in atching is depicted in l:ig  .  1 . Although our framework is in > plemented for Japanese and l ~  ; nglish , it is bmguage il , dependent . 
First , bilingual texts are aligned at sentence level using word correspondence in for in ~ tiol  , which is available in bilingual dictionaries or estimated by statis  . 
tic ~ ltechniques . " Statistical estim ~ ttioa " ttext ; level indicates that lengtl > based statistical techniques arc applied if necessary  . ( At present , they are not implemented . ) " Stati , stical c . stimation " ~ tt sentence level indicates that word-to  . -word correspondences ~ ree > timated by statistic ~ d techniques  . Then , eueh 1110110 lingual sentence is parsed into a disjunctive dependency structure ~ Hld structurally matched using word correspondence information  . In the course of struc . 
tural matching , lexical and synt ~ Lctict unbiguities of monolingu M sentences are resolved  . FinMly , from the matching results , monoling uM lexical knowledge and translation patterns m'e acquired  . 
So fitr , we have implemented the following , : sentence ~ dignment bt Lsed-on word correspondence information  , word correspondence estimation by co-occnl'rence -ffequency-based methods in GMemid Church  ( 19 . ~H ) and Kay and R6s cheisen (1993) , structured Imttehlng of parallel sentences ( Matsumoto et al . , 1993) , and case Dame acquisition of Japanese verbs ( Utsuro et al ,  1993) . In the remainder of this paper , we describe the specifications of sentence aliglmlent : and word correspondence estimation in sections  3 and 4  , then report the results of small experiments and evMuate our framework in section  5  . 
I0773 Sentence Alignment 3 . 1 Bilingual Sentence Alignment
Problem
Ill this section , we formally define the problem of bilingual sentence Mignment  ) Let S be a text of n sentences of a language , and T be a text of m sentences of another language and suppose that S and T are translation of each other : --__S l  , S2~ .   .   . ~ Sn
T = tl , t2, . . . , tm
Let p be a pair of minimal corresponding segments in texts S and T  . Suppose that p consists of x sentences a-~+ l ,  ? ? ? , Sain S and y sentence s t ~ l ,   .  ? ? , tb in T and is denoted by the following : p = a , x ; b , y ) Note that x and y could be 0 . In this paper , we call the pair of minimM corresponding segments in bilingual texts a sentence bead  . 2 Then , sentences in bilingual texts of S and T are aligned into a sequence 
P of sentence beads:
P = Pl , P ~ , ..., Pk
We put some restriction on possibilities of sentence alignment  . We assume that each sentence belongs to only one sentence bead and order constraints must be preserved in sentence alignment  . Supposing Pi = ( ai , xi ; bi , Yi ) , those constraints are expressed in the following :   a0  =  0   , b0 = 0 ai = ai1 + . ~ ci , bi = bi1q-yl ( 1<i_<k ) Suppose that a scoring function h can be defined for estimating the validity of each sentence bead pi  . 
Then , bilingual sentence alignment problem can be defined as an optimization problem that finds a sequence P of sentence beads which optimizes the total score H of the sequence P : H  ( P ) = IIh ( h ( pl )   .   .   .   .   . h(pk )) 3 . 2 B i l ingua l Sentence A l ignment us - ing Word Correspondence Infor-mation In this section  , we describe the specification of our sentence alignment method based on word correspondence information  . 3 l In this paper , we do not describe paragraph alignment process . For the moment , our paragraph alignment program is not reliable enough and the results of sentence alignment are better without paragraph alignment tban with paragraph alignment  . 
Since bilingual texts in our bilingual corpus are not so long  , the computational cost of sentence Mignment is not serious problem even without paragraph Mignment  . 
2 The term be a distaken from Brown et al (1991).
3We basically use dictionary-based bilingual sentence alignment method originMly reported in Murao  ( 1991 )  . The work in Murao ( 1991 ) was done under the supervision of Pr of . M . 
Nagao and Prof . S . Sato ( JAIST , East).
3.2.1 Score of Sentence Bead
Before aligning sentences in bilingual texts , content words are extracted frmn each sentence ( after each sentence is morphologic Mlyanalyzed if necessary  )  , and word correspondences are found using both bilin-gum dictionaries and statistical information source for word correspondence  . Then , using those word correspondence information , the score h of a sentence be adp is calculated as follows  . 
First , supposing p = ( a , x ; b , y ) , and let n ~( a , x ) and nt(b , y ) be the numbers of content words in the sequences of sentences  ~4  ,   .   .   . , s , and t~v ~ , , . . . ,tb respectively , and n~t ( p ) be then unlber of corresponding word pairs in p . Then , the score h of p is defined as the ratio of n~t ( p ) to the sum of n ~ ( a , x ) and nt(b , y ): t , ,(p ) ~ , ( p ) 3 . 2 . 2 Dynamic P rogramming Method Let Pi be the sequence of sentence beads fi'om the begbming of the bilingual text up to the bead pi : 
Pi = pa , p2, . . . , pi
Then , we assume that the score H ( Pi ) of P if ollows the recursion equation below : H ( Pi ) = ll ( Pi-l ) + h ( pl )   ( 1 ) Let Hm ( ai , bl ) be the maximum score of aligning a part of S ( from the beginning up to the ai ( = ai_l+xi ) -th sentence ) and a part of T ( f , ' om the beginning up to bi ( = bi-l + yi ) -th sentence )  . Then , Equation I is transformed into :// . ~( a ~, b ~) where the initial condition is:
Um(ao , 6o ) = H ., ( o , o ) = o
We limit the pair ( xi , Yi ) of the numbers of sentences in a sentence bead to some probable ones  . For the remnant , we allow only 11 ,  12 ,  13 ,  14 , 22 as pMrs of the numbers of sentences : ( xi , yi)e(1 , 1)  ,  (1 , 2)  ,  (2 , 1)  ,  (1 , 3)  ,  (3 ,  1) ,  (1 , 4) ,  (4 ,  1) ,  (2 ,  2 ) This optimization problem is solvable as a standard problem in dynamic programming  . Dynamic programming is applied to bilingual sentence alignment in most of previous works  ( Brown et al , 1991; Gate and Church , 1993; Chen ,  1993) . 
1 078   4 Word Correspondence Esti-mation In this section  , first we describ estimation flmctions based on co -occnrrence frequencies  . Then , we show how to incorporate word correspondence information available in bilingual dictionaries and to estimate word correspondences not included in bilingual dictionaries  . Finally , we describe the threshold fnnction for extracting corresponding word pairs  . 
4 . 1 Estimation Function in the following , we assume that sentences in the bilingual text are already aligned  . 
Let w , and w ~ be words in the texts S and T respectively  , we define the following frequencies : freq(w ~ , ,wt )  =  ( frequency of wa and wt's cooccurring in a sentence head  ) f ' , ' eq(w , ) = ( frequency of ' w . ~) freq(wt ) = ( frequency of wt)
N - ( total number of sentence beads )
Then , estimation functions of Gale's ( Gale and Church , 1991) and Kay's ( Kay and RSscheisen , 1993) are given a . s below . 
4.1.1 Gale's Method
Let a , - ~ d be as follows : b := freq(w ~) ~ freq(w ~ , wt)c-freq(*vt)--freq(w ~ , w ~) d=N-a-b--e Then , the validity of word correspondence w , and wt is estimated by the following value : ( an-be )  2  (   . +6)(~~ e)(b+a)(e+d )( . ~ b . ) " ~ freq(w ~) freq(wt ) ( N-freq(w ,   , )) ( N-freq(wt )) 4 . 1 . 2 Kay ' s Method The validity of word correspondence w ~ and wt is estimated by the following value :  2freq  ( w  ~ , wt)hk (' ,  . ~, ' . ~)-: ~ eq(w . ) + f~eq(~ . ,) 4 . 2 Incorporat ing B i l ingua l D ic t io - nary By incorporating word correspondence information available in bilingual dictionaries  , it becomes easier to estimate word correspondences not included in bilin-gum dictionaries  . 
Let w , be a word in the text S and w t , w ~ be words in the text T . Suppose that the correspondence of w , and wt is included in bilingual dictionaries , while the correspondence of w , and w ~ is not included . Then the problem is to estimate the validity of word correspondence of w  , ~ and ' w't . 
Let freq(w ~ , wt ) , freq(w  ~ , w ~) , freq(w ~) , freq(wt ) , and freq(w ~) be the same as above , and frcq(ws , wt , w't ) be the frequency of w , , we , and w't's cooccurring in a sentence bead . Then , we solve the problem above by defining freq ' ( w ,   , w ~) , fveq'(w , )  , freq'(w't ) , and N ' which becmne the inputs to Gale's method or Kay's method  . We describe two different ways of defining those vMues  . 
Estimation I
One is to estimate all the word correspondences equally excep that the cooccurrence of wa and wt is preferred to that of  , w ~ and w ~ . freq ' ( w ~ , w ' ~) , fveq'(w ~) , freq'(w't ) , and N ' are given below : 4 fveq ' ( w ,   ,   , w't ): freq(w ,   , w ' , ) - - ~ freq(w ,   , wt , w ' , ) ~ tfreq'(w , ~)-freq(ws ) freq'(w~t)-freq(w't )
N'--N(freq'(w ,   , wt)-freq(w ,   , wt )) When w ~ , wt , and w ~ are cooccurring in a sentence bead , the cooccurrence of w ~ and wt is preferred and that of w ~ and wI is ignored  . Thus , freq ' ( w , ,w~t ) is obtained by snbtracting the fi'equeney of all those cases fiom the real cooccurrence frequency of w  , and w't . But , freq ' ( w  ~ ) and freq ' ( w  ~ ) are the same as the real frequencies and the estimated word correspondences reflect here al cooccurrence frequencies in the input text  . ( Compare with Estimation II . ) Word correspondences both included and not included in bilingual dictionaries are equally estimated their va-lidities  . 
Estimation II ( File other is to remove from the input text all the cooccurrences of word pairs included in bilingual dictionaries  , freq ' ( w , , ' a4) , freq ' ( w ~) , freq ' ( w ~) , ~ mdN ' are given below : 4It can happent htLt , within it sentence bead , one word of a language has more than one corresponding word ~ of the Ol  ) -posite language and all the correspondences are included in bilinguM dictionaries  . In that case , formalizations in this section need some modifications  . 
I079 freq~(ws , w~t ) = freq(w ~ , w't)-E freq(w ~ , wt , w ~)
We freq ' ( w  ~ ) = freq ( w  ~ ) -Efreq ( w ~' wt ) wtfreq ' ( w't ) = freq ( w't ) -Efreq ( w'~ , w ; ) , o ,  #and # ( the correspondence of w ~ wt is included in bilingual dictionaries  ) 
N '= N
With this option , after all the cooccurrences of word pairs included in bilingual dictionaries are removed from the input text  , word correspondences not included in bilingual dictionaries are estimated their validities  . 
In the following sections , we temporarily adopt Es-timation I for estimating word correspondences not included in bilingual dictionaries  . It is necessary to further investigate and compare the two estimation methods with largescal experiments  . 
4.3 Threshold Function
As a threshold function for extracting appropriate corresponding word pairs  , we use a hyperbolic fimc-tion of word frequency and estimated value for word correspondence  . 
At first , we define the following variables and constants : x =  ( cooccurrence frequency ) y = ( estimated value for word correspondence ) a = ( constant for eliminating low frequency words )   (  1 . 0 for both h9 and hk ) b = ( constant for eliminating words ) with low estimated value )   (  0 . 1 for ha and 0 . 3 for hk ) c- ( lower bound of word frequency )   (  2 . 5 for both ha and hk ) Then , the threshold function g(x , y ) is defined as below : g(~ , y )  = ~ ( ~- b )   ( ~> c ) a And the condition for extracting corresponding word pairs is given below : g  ( x , y ) > 1 , x > c When using extracted word correspondences in sentence alignment and structural matching  , at present we ignore the estimated values and use estimated word correspondences and word correspondences in bilingual dictionaries equally  . 
S Note that values for constants arc determined temporarily and need fllrther investigation with largescal experiments  . 
Especially , constants related to word frequency have to be tnned to the length of texts  . 
5 Experiment and Evaluation
In this section , we report the results of a small experiment on aligning sentences in bilingual texts and statistically estimating word correspondences  . 
The sentence alignment program and the word correspondence estimation program are named AlignCO  . 
The processing steps of AlignCO are as follows : 1 . Given a bilingual text , content words are extracted from each sentence . 
2 . A JapaneseEnglish dictionary of about 50 , 0 00 entries is consulted and word correspondence information is extracted for content words of each sentence  . 
3. The sentence alignment program named
AlignCO/A aligns sentences in the input text by the method stated in section  3  . 2 . 
4 . Given the aligned sentences in the bilingual text  , the word correspondence stimation program named AlignCO/C estimates word correspondences which are not included in the JapaneseEnglish dictionary with option Estimation I in section  4  . 2 . 
5 . Combining word correspondence information available in the JapaneseEnglish dictionary and estimated by AlignCO/C  , sentences in the input text are realigned . 
As input JapaneseEnglish bilingual texts , we use two short texts of different length--1 ) " The Dilemma of National Development and Democracy "  ( 305 Japanese sentences and 300 English sentences , henceforth " dilemma ") ,  2 ) " Pacific Asia in the Post-Cold-War World " ( 134 Japanese sentences and 123 English sentences , henceforth " cold-war ") . Since the results of Gale's method and Kay's method did not differ so much  , we show the result of Gale's method only . 
5.1 Sentence Alignment
The followings are five best results of sentence alignment before and after estimating word correspondences not included in the JapaneseEnglish dictionary  . The results are improved after estimating word correspondences not included in the bilingual dictionary  . 
" dilemma " number of errors average ( five best solutions ) error rate 1st trial 1818 1919 166 . 3% 2nd trial 1314 1415 134 . 8% " cold-war " number of errors average ( five best solutions ) error rate 1st trial 564784 . 9% 2nd trial 422 502 . 1% We classify the estimated word correspondences into three categories  , " correct " , " part of phrase " , and " wrong " . " part of 1 ) hrase " means that the estimated word correspondence an be considered ~ part of corresponding phrases  . " errm " rate " is tile ratio of the number of " wrong " word correspondences to the total nunlber  .

The tbllowings are example word correspondences of each category where f ~  , f t , and f ~ , are freq(w ~) , freq(wt ) , and freq(w ~ , we ) respectively . The parenthesized correspondence is not extracted by the threshokl flmetion  .

Tile threshold function seenls optimized so that it extracts as many word correspondences of the category " correct " and " part of phrase " as possible  , and extracts as few word correspondences of the category " wrong " as possible  . 
6 Concluding Remarks
This paper described a unified framework for bilingual text matching by combining existing handwritten bilingual dictionaries and statistical techniques  . F , specially , we described an lethod for align-lug sentences using word correspondence information  , and a method for estimating word correspondences , to t included in bilingual dictionaries . 
Fstimated word correspondence information will improve the results of structural matching of bilim gual sentences  , it will be reported in the future . With the same techniques as those for estimating word co  , '-respondences , it is quite easy 1 ; oestimate correspondences of phrase such as noun phrases and idiomatic expressions  . Then , the results of structural matching will be much more iln proved  . 
In order to inlprove the accuracy of sentence aligninent  , we need to combine our word-correspondence-based method with those length-based methods in Brown et al  ( 1991 ) and Gale and Church ( 1993 )  . 
In the case of JapaneseEnglish texts , the word-based nlethod in Brown et al ( 1991 ) inight be better than tile character-b~ed method in Gale and Church  ( 1993 )  .
