Abstract : We study the weak generative capacity of a class of parenthesis-free categorial grammars derived/torn those of Aries and Steedman by varying the set of reduction rules  . 
With forward cancellation as the only rule , the grammars are weakly equivalent o contextfree grammars  . When a backward combination rule is added , it is no longer possible too h-la in all the contextfree languages  . With suitable restriction of the forward partial rule  , the languages are still contextfree and a pushdown automaton can be used for recognition  . Using the unrestricted rule of forward partial combination  , a context-sensitive language is obtained . 

The system of categorial grammars , developed illl node rntimes from the work of Ajdukiewicz  ( 1935 )  , has recently been the attention of renewed interest  , hlspired by the use of categori--alnotions in Montague gramlnar ~ more recent systems  , sne has GPSC , have developed related corlccpts and notations . This in turn leads to a resurgence of interest in pure catcg orial systems  . 
Classically , a categorial grammar is a quadruple G(VT , VA , J ; , F ) , where VT is a finite set of morl ) hemes , and VA is a tinite set of atomic categories , one of which is the distinguished category S . The set CA of categories is formed from VA as follows:  ( 1 ) VA is a subset of CA , (2) if X and Y are in CA , t . hcJ,(X,"Y ) is ICA The grammar also (: md . ain , ~a lexicon F , which is a function from words to finite subsets of CA  . A categorial grammar lacks rules ; instead there is a cancellation r idem q ) lie it ill the formalism : if X and Y are categories  , then ( X/Y ) Y-'X . 
The lauguage of a categorial grammar is the set of terminal strings with corresponding category symbol strings reducible by cancellation to the sentence symbol S  . 
In \[1\] Ades and Steedman offer a form of categorial grammar in which some of the notations and concepts of the usual categorial grammar are modified  . The formalism at first appears to be more powerful  , because in addition totile cancellation rule there are several other metarutes  . I Iowever , on closer examination there are other reasons to suspecl  , that tile resulting language class ( lifters sharply from that of the traditional grammars  . Among the new rules , the forward partial rule ( FI ) rule ) is most interesting , since one may immediately conchlde that this rule leads to a very large number of possible parsings of any sentence  ( almost equal to the number of different binary trees of n leaves if the length of the sentence is n  )  . But its effects on the generative power of categorial grammar are not really obvious and immediate  . A des and Steedman raised the question in the footnote  7 in \[1\] and left it unanswered . We will first formally define categorial grammar and the associated concepts  . Then we analyze the generative power of the categoriat graln mars with different interesting combinations of the reduction rnles  . 
The categorial gralrnnars considered here consist of both a categorial component and a set of reduction rules  . The category symbols differ from the traditional one she cause they are parenthesis-free  . The categorial component Cmlsists as before of a set VA of atomic categories including a distinguished symbol S  , and a lexical function F mapping words to finite sets of categories  . However , the definition of category differs : ( 1 ) VA is a subset of CA , (2) if X is in CA , and A is in VA , then X/A is in CA . Notice that the category symbols arc parenthesis free  ; the implicit parenthesization is left to right . Thus the symbol ( A / ( B/C ) ) of traditiolml categorial grammar is excluded , since A/B/C abbreviates (( A/B)/C ) . l to weve . r , some of the rules treat A/B/C as though it were , in fact , ( A/(B/C )) .

Notation . We use A , B , C to denote atomic category symbols , and U , V , X , Y to denote arbitrary ( complex ) category symbols . 
The number of occurrences of atomic category symbols in X is IXI'Strings of category symbols are denoted by x  , y . Morpheme , s are denoted by a , b ; * nor pheme strings by u , v , w . 
A categorial grammar under certain reduction rides is a quadruple  G1?  :  ( VT , VA , S , F ) , where : V T is a finite set of mor-phelnes , V A a tinite set of at to lnic categories , SEVA a distinguishe delelnent , F a function from VT to 2 cA such that for every a EVT , F ( a ) is finite , where CA is the category set and is defined as: i  ) if AEVA , then AECA , ii ) if XECA and ACVA , then X/AECA , iii ) nothing else is in CA . 
The set , of reduction rules R can include any combination of the folh  ) wing : ( 1 )   ( F Rule ) If U/AECA , AEVA , the string U/AA can be replaced by U . We write : U/AA-*U ; 2)(\]i'PRule ) If U/A , A/VECA , where AEVA , the string U/AA ~ V can be replaced by U~V . We write : U/AA . ' V --+

When it WOIl~t cause confusion , we write Gf ? to denote a categorial grammar with rule set R  , and specify a categorial grammar by just spe , cifying its lexicon F . 
The reduce relation > on CA*xCA * is defined as : for alloq flECA * and all X  , Y , ZECA , o ~ XYfl->o ~ Z\[3 if XY-- , Z . 
Let :>* denote the reflexive and transitive closure of relation Arnor pheme string W = WlW = '' ' wn  , where wi EVT , i = 1 , 2  ,   .   . ? n , is accepted by G , t :-: ( V T , VA , S , F ) if there is XiEF(wi ) for i = 1 , 2 ,  ?  .   . n , such that X1X = ??? X ,->* S . 
The language accepted by Gn = -( V T , VA , S , F ) , L ( GR ) is the set of all nmrpheme strings that are accepted by  G1? ? The categorial grammar recognition problem is : given a categorial gl'amrnar GI ? = CGR  ( VT , VA , S , F ) and a morpheme string wEVT * , decide whether wEL(GR ) . 
The derivable cateyory set DAc_C Alm deraset R of reduction rules is the set of categories including all the primary categories designated by F  , and all the reachable categories under that set of reduction rules  . It is formally defined as : i ) X is in DA if th cre is an a EVT such that XE F  ( a )  , ii ) For all X , YEDA and ZECA , if XY-~Z by some rule in R then ZEDA , and iii )
Nothing else is in DA.
GRAMMARSW\[TI1I , ' OIt WARD CANCEL LATION ONLY We begin by looking at the most restricted form of the forward combination rule  . It is wellknown that traditional categorial grammars are equivalent o context--free grammars  . 
We examine the proof to see that it still goes through for categorial grammars GR with R = IF  . 
Theorem The categorial grammars GI ~ , R = F , generate exactly the contextfree langnages . 
Proof (1) l , et GR be a eategorial grammar with R = IF . Gt ~ becomes a traditional categorial graln mar once parentheses are restored by replacing them from left to right  , so that , e . g . , A/B/C becomes (( A/B)/C ) . Hence , its language is CF . 
(2 ) To show that every context-free language can be obtained  , we begin with the observation that every context free language has a grammar in Greibach  2 form , that is , with all rules of the three forms A ~> a BC , A -> a B , and A->a , where A , B , Care in VN and a is in VT\[6\] . A corresponding classical categorial grammar can beirn mediate \] y constructed : ~"  ( ~ ) ~- I (   ( A/C ) /B )   , ( A/B ) , A . These are the categories A/C/B , A/B , and A of a parenthesis free categorial grammar . 
The details of the proof can be easily carried out to show that the two languages generated are the same  . 
CRAMMARS WITH BACKWARDS CANCELLATION :\[' he theorem shows that with R = F exactly the contextfree languages are obtained  . What happens when the additional metarules are added ? We examine now parenthesis-free categorial grammars with R = F  , B and R = F , P , s . Rule Bs is the version adopted in \[11 ; B is an obvious generalization . In either case we are adding the equivalent of contextfree rules to a grammar  ; the result must therefore still yield a context free language  . So one guess might be that categorial gram--mars ol these types will still yield exactly the contextfree languages  , perhaps with more struct m'es for each sentence . An alternative conjecture would be that fewer languages are obtained  , for we have no wadded some " involuntary " contextfree rules to every grammar  . 
Example : Consider the standard contextfree language L  1 = a " bn\] n>0  . Theea ~ a lest grammar is S->aSb,S->ab . The Creibach2 form grammar is S->aSH , B -> b , S->a B . The constructed categorial grammar GI~then has f  ( a ) = S/B , S/B/S and F(b ) = B . If R = IF , this yields exactly I , vI lowever , with R = F , BorR = F , B s , here equivalent , GR yields a language L2 = ab , ba , a abb , abab , bbaa , baba , baab ,   . . . 
, which contains L1 and other strings as well . It is the language of the contextfree grammar with rule set S->bC  , S -> Cb , C -> aS' , C -> S a , C -> a . 
Reversible languages . Let x1?be the reverse of string x . 
That is , if x = ala2"""a n(a , EVT ) , then xR = a , ~  .   . " a2 al . 
Calla language L reversible if xEL iff xnEL.
Examples : The set of all strings on a , b with equal numbers of a ' s and b's is a reversible CF language  . a " bIn > 0 is not a reversible language . 
Theorem The languages of categorial grammars GR with R = 
IF , B are reversible.
Proof if x =>* S , then zn =>* S by a reduction whose tree is the mirror image of the one for x in which rules F and B have been interchanged  . 
Theorem Let G , ~ be a categorial grammar with R contains F , Borl " , Bs-R may or may not also contaln some form of FP rules  . If L ( G  ~ ) contains any sentence of length greater than one , then it contains at least one sentence wuv such that vu is also in L  ( GR )  . 

ProofLet w be a sentence of L ( Gn ) of length greater than one . 
Suppose the final step of the reduction to S uses rule F  . Then wuv where u->~S/A and v >* A . But then vu >* AS/A->S by rule B or Bs . No form of FP can be used a ~ q the final step of the reduction to S  , so its presence does not affect the result . 
Corollary There are contextfree languages that cannot be obtained by any categorial grammar G ~  , where R contains F , 
BorF , Bs.
CAT BGORIAL GRAMMAR , ISCONTEXT-FREE1 F THEFP
RULEISRESTRICTEI)
Tile method that had been used to construct a contextfree grammar G equivalent o a classical categorial grammar can be formally described as following : /~/ Foreaehae V T  , if X ~ F ( a ) , then put X->a in G ; For each derivable category X/Y , put X ~ X/Y Y in G . 
This method remains valid when Bs rule is added . We just need to put an additional rule X->YX/ Y in G whenever X is headed by S  . But this doesn't work when the FP rule is allowed  . We might put in the CF rule U/V->U/AA/V for each derivable category U/V and for each atomic category A  , but in case there is a category like A/B/A , then any category symbol headed by A followed by B's and ended by A is a derivable category  . There are infinitely many of them , so by using this construction method , we might have to put in an infinite number of CF rules  . Therefore , this method does not always find a finite context free grammar equivalent to a category grammar with the FP rule  . As we shall see , there may be no such contextfree grammar . 
Let's now enf ' orce some restrictions on the FP rule so that it wo n't cause an infinite number of derivable categories  . Actually , using the FP rule sometimes violates the parenthesis convention  , e . g . applying FP~n4'Bt ?" ( ?/ Dbnplle ~ ~ hatB/C/D is interpreted as ( B / ( C/D ) )  . t lowever , by the parenthesis convention , B/C/D is the abbreviation of (( B/C)/D ) . Notice , however , when the second category symbol ha~exactly two atomic symbols  , i . e . , is in form A/B , the FP rule does not violate the convention . Coincidentally , if the FP rule is accordingly restricted as to FP z  , the derivable category set becomes finite . 
Lemma For a categorial grammar G~(VA , VT ' , S , F ) , let RI = F , FP2 , R2 = F , FP2 , Bs ; and Rz = F , FP e , P , , then DAI ~ 1 = DAR2 = DAR3 . 
ProofFrom the definition ii ) of DA , we can see that any new category Z added to DA by a form of the B rule can be added by the F rule  . The lemma follows . 

Lemma The derivable category set DA of a eategorial grammar GI ~ with R =/ F  , FP2 is finite and constructible . 
Sketch of Proof We begin with the observation that none of the reduction rules in R increases the length of category symbols  , and the initial lexical category symbols are all of finite length  . This implies that the length of all the derivable category symbols are bounded  . So there are only finitely many of them . 
We now give an algorithm for computing DA , to show that , it is constructible . 
Algorithm : Compute DA of a Gn with R = F , FP 2.

Theorem For every categorial grammar GR(VT , VA , S , F ) , with R = F , FP2 , B s , there is a contextfree grammar G(VT , VN , S , P ) such that L(G , t ) = L(G ) . 
Sketch of Proof Since DA is finite , the method for converting CC to CFG described in last section works  . 

Remark The theorem remains true for R being F , FP21 and IF , FP2 , B , and can be similarly proved . We choose R = F , FP2 , Bs to state the theorem because it is closes to
Ades and Steedman's model\[1\].

Now the next question is what if the I " P rule is not restricted to U/AA/B-~U/B  . Intuitively , we can see that the application of the FP rule on a category which is not headed by S is not crucial in the sense that it carl be replaced by an application of the Frule  , because whenever U/AA/V appears in a valid derivation to a sentence  , the V part nlust be cancelled outso oner or later  , so we can make a new derivation that cancels the Vpart first and get U/A A on which we can apply the F rule instead of the FP rule  . But this doesn't hold if U/A is headed by S . For example , when we have AS/BB/A , we can't do backward combnation on A and S/A if we don't combine S/B and B/A first  . So , ~e expect that the weak generative power of categorial grammar would remain unchanged if the FP rule is restricted t ~  , bt used only on categories which are headed by S . This in fact follows as our next theorem . 
Lemma Given a categorial grammar Gi ? ( V T , VA , S , F ) with R = F , FP , B s , for any wECA * and A~VA , if there is a reduction w -->* A , then there is a reduction of w to C using FP rule only on categories which are headed by S  . 
Sketch of Proof Formalize tile idea illustrated a bow !  . \[\] As an almost immediate consequence , we have : Theorem The language accepted by categorial grammar GI e  ( VT , VA , S , F ) with R = F , FP , Bs is the same ast Imt accepted with R = F , FPs , B s . 
Proof It trivially follows the lermna . \[\] Corollary FP rule is useless if there is no form of the B rule  , i . e . , any GIe ( VT , VA , S , F ) with R = F , FP will generate the same language ~ us that germrated with R = F  . 
ACONTEXTSENSITIVE LANG UAGEGENERATt DUSING
UNRESTRICTED FPRULE
This section gives a categorial grammar with unrestricted FP rule thai  . genera . tesalanguage which is not contextfree . Consider categorial grammar G1 = GIe(VA , VT , S , F ) , where VT-a , b , c , VA--A , C , S , r(a ) = A , F ( b ) = S/A/C/S , S/A/IU , F ( c ) = C , and R = F , B s , FP . 
Claim 1 aibie ' ~ L(G1) for i > 0.
Proof For any i . > O ~ we can find a corresponding categorial string for a ' b'c':A'  ( S/A/C/S ) i-t ( S/A/C ) C ' . A reduction to S is straightforward . \[\] Let gb ~ ( a ) denote the number of occurrences of a in string w . 
Claim 2For all w ~ VT *, if wEL(GI ) then
Cw(a ) = ~( b ) = ~, 0(c).
Proof First , it is ea ~ sy to see that from the lexical categories  , we cannot get any complex category headed by either A or C  , and we can get atomic category symbol A or C only directly from the lexicon  . 
Second , each morpheme b would introduce one A and one C within a complex category symbol which must be cancel h~lout sooner or later in order to reduce the whole string to S  . In general , there are two ways for such A and C being cancelled :  ( 1 ) with an A headed or Cheaded complex category by the FP rule  , which is impossible in this example ;   ( 2 ) with a single atomic category A or C by either the F or P  , srule . We have seen that such single A and C can only be introduced by the morpheme a and c  , respectively . So4) w(a ) : := q~,0(b ) = ~ bw(c) . 

To show that L(G1) is not contextfree , we take its intersection with the regtl\]ar language a * b : ~ c : ~  .  \]? , y  claim1 and 2 , the intersection is exactly the laugu ; Lgeanb " c ~'\] n > 0 which is wellknown to be noncontextfree . Since the intersection of a contextfree language with a regular set must be conte  . xtfree,
L(GI ) cannot be contextfree.

A categorial grammar is certainly no worse than context sensitive  . We can verify this by using a noud ctermiuistic linear bounded auLoma toll to model the reduction process  . For even in the case of reduction by the unrestricted l  , ' Prule , the category symbol obtained by reduction is shorter than the cornbiqed length of the two input st  , o1he rule . 
Ades and Steedman \[1\] propose a processor that is a pushdown stack automaton and pushdownstack automata are known to correspond to the contextfree languages  . I tow can we reconcile this with the cnn text sensitive example a bow ~? The contradiction arises because the stack of their processor must be able to contain any derive deal ~ egory symbol of DA  , and thus the size of the stack symbols is unlimited  . The processor is thus not a pushdowrl autoulaton in the usual sense  .
