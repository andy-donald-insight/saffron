The RUMORS synthesizer of Russian is a , ~ integral part of the JM~AP experimental system of  , ht . pn . nese-Russianantom . t ~ tic translation , although it cn , n also h ~ ve other ~ p pli cz rt ions . Morphologically , it is based , primtrrily , on A . A . Z Mizny ~ k's model of Russi~t . inflexion . Syntactical functions of RUMORS rely on word -order ~ nd dependency d~t ~ as input information  . The synthesizer is implemented on IBMPC,
MSDOS , in Turbo Pascal.
1 General information
The RUMORS system of RUssian MOR phologicul and Syntactical synthesis has been developed as part of the JaRAP experimental system of Jt~p~nese -Russianantoma ~ tictra~sl ~ tion  , described in ( Mod-in a , Shaly~pin~ , 1994) . Its operation is , however , completely independent of the other components of the  Jatl2kP system , so that RUMORS could be used in any other AT system irrespective of its source l~n-guage  . Basically , RUMORS constitutes a system in its own right , which can also be used for purposes other th~n tra~nsl ~ tion  , e . g . , as ~ computerized reference book of Russian morphology and the simplest phenomena of syntactic government a ~ tdagreement  ( for students and teachers of Russian )  , ~ part of spellchecking system , etc . 
The RUMORS synthesizer has two m~jor modes of oper ~ tlon : the QUERY modettnd the TASK mode  . 
In the QUERY mode of operr ~ tion , It UMOItS accepts , as its input , a separate syntactico-morphological query ( entered from the keybo ~ Lrd ) which represents the lexeme to be processed ~ nd the synttmt lcal  . ~ . nd morphological charaeteristics specify-lagthe wordform to be obtained by the processing  . 
The output is , primarily , the desired word form of the input lexeme or , if necessary , ~ periphrastic ~ u 6 stitute for this word form . 
After obtaining this output , the user c~t s witch at will to the FULL PARADIGM submode of the QUERY mode  . In this submode , RUMORS gener-~rte8 all synthetic wordforms of the input lexeme ( or of the l~t lexeme processed while obtaining a pc-riphra ~ tic word-combina  . tion ) . It n \], o offers s . set of menusal Iowing the user to modify his initial qlmry by choosing additions \] morphologic M categorh ~ s from ~  ; lLeseIt\](2 ~ rtllS . 
In the TASK mode ~ the input d~t~isi~sequence . 
of queries fed from the special TASK file . Apart from lexical , morphological , and syntactic Minform ~ tlon contained in eaclt query  , the TASK mode of op-ertLtion m~kes considerable use of word order  ( l~t ~ which is essential , ax nong other things , for processing prepositional , adjectival and noun phrases . The output is the sequence of word forms manifesting the phrases or sentences specified by the input sequence of queries  . 
Both in the QUERY ttndb tth . eTASK modes , the output is displayed on the screen and written slmul-taneously in the speci ~ SOLVE file  . If required by the user , it may M so include the alterations rome in the queries processed and the d~tubase informa ~ tion used in their processing  . In as much as the simulatio~t by RUMORS of ttte linguistic processes involved in tl  . ussla~t synthesis is faithful enough , this ~ uxillary d~ttL could be valuable by itself  ( e . g . , for learning or teaching Russian ) , ~ide from its significance for debugging and controlling purposes  . 
2 Synthesis functions envisaged by RUMORS 2 . 1 Morphoh ) gical functions The morphologic ~ funct lolts of RUMORS cover HI aspects of Russia  . nin~le:don , as well as some semr~n-tic Mlybafic lcxico -morphologlca J relationships  . 
'\[' heinlh : xi on a \] funetions tL reinitiated after the input query ha~~dreaxtybeen subjected to syntactical and lexieo-morphologl cal operations  , which retryll trve modified its htitial form . At this stage , ii : cont M as nothing but the lexeme and the infiexion td categories specifying its desired wordform  . If some categories needed for complete specific trtion of this wordform are not explicltly stated in the query  , they are settled by default . E . g . , a query containing nothing but the lexeme of a verb is taken to describe the finite person singular of this verb  , so that the query , s~y , 6 pam ~ produces the form 6 epem . 
The inilexional model of Russian implemented by RUMORS is the one proposed and detailed by prof  . 
A . A . Zaliznyak (1977) . Its important virtue is ttt at the generation procedures it envls ~ ges represent those to be expected of human speakers of Russian more faithfully than any other known model  , wt file the requisite database information is very compact  . 
Our verslo~t of Zalizn yaMs inflexion ai model differs from its description in  ( Zaliznyabq 1977 ) in two respects . On the one haztd ~ we have reduced the scope of the original Zalizny ~ k's model  , implementing it only in s of axas written Russ ltrn is concerned  . As tr result , quite a number of the p~rticulars of Russian accentuation registered in  ( Zallznyak , 1977) , nt ~ mely , all those that axe relev ~ t for oral speech only , have been ignored . 
On the other hand , we h~ve extended the model to cover analytical wordforms  . Moreover , we have introduced a new type of morphological functions  , the periphrastic functions allowing RUMORS to produce output that makes sense even if the required worfl-form is nonexistent  ( e . g . , due to the lexeme h~ving a defective paradigm or to the combination of cs  . te-gor lea in the query being beyond the scope of Rus-slaninfiexlonal morphology  )  . E . g . , the future tense ist person singular of the verb noge ~ um~'win '  ( which does not h ~ vet hlsform ) is p~r ~ phrase de . uo~ynoge ~ urn ~' < I > ~ hall be able to win ' . 
The lexlco-morphological functions of RU-MORS axe limiteds of axto conversion between lexemes having essentially similak semantics  , but differ-ins in their part-of-speech or ( for verbs only ) aspec-tuai characteristics . ' l'hus~the aspectuM or part-of-speech markers in the following three queries paa ocrn  . ~arn~:coo,
Snarn ~: lIc~use the lexeme ~ in these queries to be replaced  , resp . , by the required perfective verb , noun , a : nd adjective : paeemu . aarat , ~ l,ne~luetu $ oecmubtl ~ I . 
The implementation f aspectual lexico -morphological reations is based  , principally , o~t their description in ( Zalizny ~ k , 1977) . For p~rt-of-speech relations , we have adopted , though in a very limited sense , the concept of lexical substitutions ( Zholkovs ldj , Mel'chuk ,  1970) . 
If the d~tabase contains no information ecessary for switcldng to a lexeme of the desired a ~ pect or paxt of speech  , RUMORS resorts to its periphrastic functions or else m~kes modification si~t the query  . 
E . g . , the query '~ U~OS~Ug : 1' aimed at forming the verb corresponding to the noun uunoouur ' bureaucrat '  , will be processed to produce the phrase : Deaaern ms  , umoxapa ~ mepnoDAxuu ~ oo ~ uEa ' < He > is doing what is typical of a bureaucrat '  . 
2.2 Syntactical functions
RUMORS has two m~jor types of syntactical fune -tlons : relational ttndword-stringsues  . There is a las a third group of prepositional \ ]unctions  . 
Relational functions may be called both in the QUERY and in the TASK mode of operation to modify the input query with regard to the relational re  . 
erenees it may include . There may be references to dependency relations , where the node specified by the query acts either as dependent  ( D-references ) or as governor ( G-references , and to ~ napt toric relations ( F-references ) . I ) - and G-references may contain embedded rehLtional references  , o that in the gen-era\]case each reference present in the input query corresponds to tL more or leas corrt plex fragment of the dependency and anaphoric structure this query is p ~ rrt of  . 
The job of the rel~t lonal functions is to ensure fulfilment of the requirements for syntectical government and ~ greement which may be imposed on the wordform specified by the query by the dependency and anaphor lc relations this query has refereuces to  . 
Tkls involves extr0cting such requirements from the references in the query  , reconciling them with enc . hother ( if there axe two or more references dictating conflicting requlrements  ) ~ a . nd then r nodify lng the inl-tim query to fit them : choosirt g the correct prepoul-tion or conjunction  ( tire empty one , if needs be ) to accompany the goal wordform , ~It dultering ja ~ required , the inflexional and paxt-obspeech ategories within the query  . E . g . , the query pemenue R D~ ( aat ~ ucem ~ ) describing the noun petueuue ' decision ~ an the synt~tc-tical object of the verboasuee m ~' depend ' will produce the prepo ~ it lonai combination : ompeme nu ~ r ' < depend > on < the > decision '  . 
Word-strlng fimctlons axe specific to the TASK mode of operation only  . Their peculiarity is that they include some t ~naly sis-llke operations maldng it possible to locates  . nd proces simple prepositional , adjectival and noun phrazes , even if the input sequence of queries h ~ no syntactical marking  . 
To be more part lcul ~ r , word-strlng processing consists i next ~ mining the queries of the input sequence one by one until the query under exam lut Lt lon is found to answer our definition of the end of a word-string  . During this ex~min ~ tlon , e~ch query is checked for information relevant o agreement tLnd prel  ) ozition a J gow ~ rnmen l ;  , ~ J , nd tile inflexion ~ l ; J , adtion axe integrated into a special word-strir ~ g query  ( w-query )  . After the end of the word-string bus been located and exarnhted  , the w-query obta . hted is , i ~ t staat dax d ca~es ~ rome common to all of the individual queries within this word-string  . ' rhus ~ the sequence of morphologically empty querle  , for lexeme so , oe cb ~ at u , aa . ~ a ~ amura ' in , all , our , galaxy ' will be processed to pro&me the prepodtion M phrase : so  8ee ~uatae Cleaaa ~ mu ~ e ' in the whole of our # alaxy '  . 
Some types of word-strlngs , e . g . tho ~ e containing ct ~ r-d inM numerals , have to be subjected to more elaborate operations . 
If ? query with laaword-string contains rela . tlonal references , the requirements imposed by these are given priority over the requirements extr~ted by word -string functions ~ so that the l ~ tter provide a sort of default  . 
Prepositional functions s . reemployed in both modes of operation , if the wordform or word-string being processed is to be preceded by a preposition  . 
Tltus ~ if ttte preposition i ~ t question denote ~ location  , direction or source , the noun it i ~ meant to accom-panty is checked for having lexical preferences in thi ~ respect  . This helps to account , e,g . , for such idiom rtt-iCf la . flaayam ~ e ' in the ~ tree t '

nnepey aue ' in the aide-,~treet'.
Other prepositional fa~tctio , ts serve to ~ dd the prothetieut opersonal pronouns ~  . fter prepositions imposht g this requirement , o choose the eou textual form of the prepositlon if it ha ~ more tht ~ none of the f the tc  . 
The data . base ha ~ thus been reduced to least hanone fifth of  ( Z Miznya . k , 1977), stillMt'ordiIIg correct morphologica . lproees , ~ing of M1 of the 100000 lexemes listed in (7 , ali'anyak , 1977) . 
Moreover , so far ~ m lexeme 8 with st ~ n ( hLrd morpho-\]ogle'elch ~ razterlstlcs go , they ctLn now be processed correctly , even if they axe newly-colned or occasional ( and do not ht we therefore diction axy entries of their own  )  . As ( Z Mizny~k , 1977 ) m~y be trusted to e on t MnM1 nonstandard lexemes , the inllexion M~nd aspec-tu ~ l information i the resulting d~t  , ~b ~ evry nearly covers the whole of the ltuss b ~ r t voct ~ bulaxy  . 
The sltu ~ Mon is different with inform ~ tlon to be used in p~rt-of-speec  . h conversion ~ nd syntactic pro-c(;~dng , for it i ~ not provided in ( Zslie , ny~k , 1977) .
