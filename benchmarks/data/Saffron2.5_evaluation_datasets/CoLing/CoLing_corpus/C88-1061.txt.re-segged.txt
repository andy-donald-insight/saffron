Ahstract : This paper outlines a theory of constituent coordination For l  , exica I-Funetional Grammar . On this theory LFG's flat , unstructured nets are used as the functional representation of coordinate constructions  , l " unction application is extended to sets by treating a sett brmally am the generalization of its Functional clmnents  . This causes properties attributed externally to a coordinate structure to be uniformly distributed across its elements  , without requiring additional grammatical specifications  . 

A proper treammnt of coordination has long been a nelusive goal of both tl more tical and computational pln ' oachesto language  . The original transformational formulation in terms of the Coordinate Reduction rule  ( e . g . /1 ) ougherty 1970/ ) was quickly shown to have many theoretical and empirical inadequacies  , and only recently have linguistic theories ( e . gGPSG/Gazdarctal . 1985/, Catcgorial granmmr ( e . g . /Steedman 1985/ ) made substantial progress one haractm ' izing the complex restrictions on coordinate constructions and also on their smnantic intert n'etations  . 
Coordination has also presente descriptive problems for emnputational approaches  . Typically these have been solved by special devices that are added to the parsing algorithms to analyze coordinate constructions that cannot easily be characterized in explicit rules of grmnmar  . The best known examples of this kind of approach are SYSCONJ/Woods  1973/  , LSP/Sager 1981/ , and MSG/l ) ahl and McCord 19831 . 
Coordination phenomen are usually divided into two classes  , t be so called constituent coordinations where the coordinated elements hmk like otherwise well -motivated phrasal constituents  111  . and none on stituent coordinatio fi where the coordinated elements look like fragments of pl  ) rasal constituents ( 2 )  . 
(1) ( a ) A girl saw Mary and ranto Bill .   ( Com'dinated verb phrases )   ( b ) Agirlsaw and heard Mary .   ( Com'dinated verbs ( 2 ) Billwen Lto Chicago on Wednesday and New York on Thursday  . 
Of course , what is or is not a well-motivated constituent depends on the details of the particular grammatical theory Constituents in transformationally-oriented heories  , For example , are units that simplify the feeding relations of transformational rules  , whereas " constituents " in eategorial grammars merely reflec the order of binary combination  . ~; and have no other special motivation . In lexical-functional grammar , sm'faee constituents are taken to be the units of t  ) honological interpretation . The senmy differ markedly frmn the units of functional or semantic interpretation  , as shown in the analysis of Dutch cross serial dependencies given by/Bresnan et al  1982/  . 
Noneon stituent coordination , of course , presents a wide variety of complex and difficult descriptive problems  , but constituent coordination also raises important linguistic issues  . It is the latter that we focus on in this brief paper  . 
To a first ai ) proximation , constituent coordinations can be analyzed as the result of taking two independent clauses and factoring out their comnmn subl  ) arts . The verb coordination in ( lb ) is thus related to the Fuller sentence coordination in  ( 3 )  . This intuition , which was the basis of the Coordinate Reduction Transformation  , accounts for more emnplex patterns of acceptabil ity such am  ( 4 ) illustrates . The coordination in /4 e ) is acceptable because both ( 4a ) and ( 4b ) are , while ( 4e ) is bad because of the independent sube a tegorization violation in  ( 4d )   ( 3 ) A girl saw Mary and a girlheard Mary . 
(4) ( a ) A girl dedicated apie to Bill.
(b ) A girl gave a pie to Bill.
(c ) A girl dedicated and gave a pieto Bill.
( d ) * Ag Mateapie to Bill.
( e ) * A girl dedicated and at eapie to Bill.
This first approximation is frought with difficulties  . It ensures that constituents of like categories can be conjoined only if they share some finer details of specification  , but there are more subtle conditions that it does not cover  . For example , even though ( 5a ) and ( 5b ) are both independently grammatical , the coordination i ( 5c ) is unacceptable: ( 5 )   ( a ) The girl promised John to go . 
(b ) The gM persuaded John to go.
(c )* The girl promised and persuaded John to go.
IHint : Who is g'oing 9)
Another welbknown difficulty with this approach is that it does not obviously allow for the necessary semantic distinctions to be made  , on the assumption that the semantic properties of reduced coordinations are to be explicated in terms of the semantic representations of the propositional coordinations that they are related to  . This is illustrated by the contrasting semantic entailments in  ( 6 ) : Sentence ( 6a ) allows for the possibility that two different girls are involved while  ( 6b ) implies that a single ( but indefinite ) girl performed both actions . 
(6 )   ( a ) A girl saw Mary and a girl talked to Bill . 
(b ) A girl saw Mary and talked to Bill.
l ) espite its deficiencies , it has not been easy to find a satisfactory alternative to this first approximation  . The theoretical challenge is to embed coor dimttion in a grammatical system in a way that is independent of the other generalizations that are being expressed legaetives correspond to passives  , NP's in English can be ( bliowed by relative clauses , English relative clauses look like S's with a missing NP  ) hut which interacts with those specifications in just the right ways  . 
That is , a possible but unacceptable solution to this descriptive dilemma would be to add to the grammar new versions of all the basic rules designed specifically to account br the vagaries of coor  ( tination . 
Coordination was not discussed in the original t brmulation of  , exica M " nnctional Grammar/Kaplan & lh'es nan 1982/  , although mathematical objects ( finite sets of fstructures ) were introduced to provide an underlying representation for grammatical constructions which  , like the parts of a coordination , do not seem to obey the uniqueness conditiml that normally applies to grammatical functions and features  . Adjuncts and other modifying constructions are them ~  , i or o ~ tample of this that Kapleln and Brcsnan discussed  , but they also suggested that the same nm then mtical representations might also be used in the analysis of coordinatim ~ l  ) he nomena . In the present paper we extend the I , FG formalism to provide a simple account of coordination that Follows along the generalines of the Kaplan/Bresnan suggestion and does not involve detailed specifications of the coordination properties of particular constituents  . We illustrate the consequences of this extension by discussing a small mnnber of grammatical constructions  ; Bresnan , Kaplan , end Peterson ( forthcoming ) discuss a much wider range of phenomen and provide more general linguistic motivation tbr this approach  . 
Simple Coordination
A lexical-functional grammar assigns two syntactic levels of representation to each grammatical str ing in a language  . The constituent structure , or c-structure , is a convemtion a\[lreetha L indicates tbc organization of surface wm'ds and phrases  , while the fimctienal structure ( gstrueturc ) is a hierarchynf attributes and values that represents the grammatical functions and features of the sentence  . 
MeG assumes as a basic axim n that there is a piecewise function  , called a structural correspondence or " pro . iection " , that maps from the nodes in the e-structure to the units in an abstract f-structure  ( see/Kaplan & Bresnan i982/ and / Kaplan 1987/ lbr details )  . This means that the properties of the f-structure can be specified in terms of the mother-daughter and precedence relations in the c-structure  , even though the f-structure is formally not at all a treelike structure  . 
Now let us consider a simple example of coordination wherein two sentences are conjoined together  ( 7 )  . A plausible c-structure for this sentence is given in  ( 8 )  , and we propose ( 9 ) to represent the fnnctional properties of this sentence  . 
(7) John bought apples and Johnate apples.

OBJL NUMPL to the component sentences of the coordination  .   ( We use brackets with a line at the center to denote set objects  . ) As Bresnan , Kaplan , and Peterson ( forthcoming ) observe , sets constitute a plausible formal representation for coordination since an unlimited number of items can be conjoined in a single construction and none of those items dmninates or has scope over the others  . Neither particular functional attributes nor recursive embeddings of attributes can provide the appropriate representation that fi at  , unstructured sets allow ? To obtain the representation & coordination shown in  ( 8 ) and ( 9 )  , all we need is the following alternative way of expanding S:  ( 10 ) S~SCONJS This rule says that a conjoined sentence consists of a sentence followed by a conjunction followed by another sentence  , where the 5structures of each subsentence is an element of the f -structure that represents their coordination  . 
Coordination with Distribution
The next step is to consider constituent coordinations where some parts of the sentence are shared by the coordinated constituents  . Consider the following sentence : (  11  ) John bought and at eapples ? ( 12 )   ( 13 ) s

The desired c-structure and f-structure for ( 11 ) are shown in ( 12 ) and ( 13 ) respectively ? Notice that the subjects and objects of BUY and EAT are linked  , so that the f-structure is different from the one in  ( 9 ) for John bought apples and Johnate apples . The identity links in this structure account for the different semantic entaihnents of sentences  ( 7 ) and ( 11 ) as well as \[' or the differences in ( da ) " and ( db )  . 
'\[' his is an example of verb coordination , so the following alternative is added to the grammar:  ( 14 ) V - ) VCONJV This rule permits the appropriate c -structure configuration but its functional specifications are no different than the ones for simple sententia\[coordination  . \ [ low then do the links in ( 13 ) arise ? The basic descriptive device of the LFG formalism is the function application expression :   ( 15 )   ( f a ) =vAs originally formulated by/Kaplan and Bresnan  1982l   , this equatmn ( 15 ) holds if and only iff denotes an f-structure which yields the value v when applied to the attr ibute a  . According to the oiiginal definition , the value of an application expression is undefined when f denotes a set of fstructures instead of a single function and an equation such as  ( 15 ) would therefore be false . Along with Bresnan , Kaplan , and Peterson ( forthcoming ) , we propose extending the function-application device so that it is defined for sets of functions  . If s denotes a set of functions , we say that ( sa ) =v holds if and only if v is the generalization of all the elements or s applied to a :  ( 16 )   ( sa ) = N ( f a )  , for all fEs The generalization flrlf2 of two functions or fstructures fL and f2 is defined recursively as follows: ( 17 ) Iff l =\[ ? then flFIf2 = fl . If fl and f2 are fstructures , then f ~ r lf2 = < a ,   ( / ela ) H ( f2a ) > la ( DOM ( fl ) NDOM ( f2 ) The generalization is the greatest lower bound in the subsumption ordering on the f-structure lattice  . 
These definitions have two consequences . The first is that v subsumes ( f a ) for all f ( s . Thus the properties aserted on a set as a whole must be : distributed across the elements of the set  . This explains why the subject and object of ( 11 ) are distributed across both verbs without having to change the VP rule in  ( 18 )  . The equations on the object NP of ( 18 ) says that ( \]" OBJ )  = $ . The meta . variable " 1' " denotes a set because the L structure of the VP node is the same as the f-structure of the conjoined V node  , which by (14) is a set . Therefore the effect of rule ( 18 ) is that each of the elements of the 1' will have an OBJ attribute whose value is subsumed by the f-structure corresponding to apples  . 
(18) V ~ VNP , 1, = t(toBJ ) = $
The second consequence of ( 16 ) is that v takes on the attributes and values that all of the  ( f a ) have in common . This is useful in explaining the ungrammatical i ty of the promise and persuade sentence in  ( 4 )  .   ( We are indebted to Andreas Eisele and Stefan Momma for calling our attention to this example  . ) The analysis for this sentence is in ( 20 ) and ( 2l ) :  ( 19 ) * The girl promised and persuaded John to go ( 20 ) s

SUBJ o . J pNE ?'? ?< JZ"t\]>1 vcoMpisu ~ J/j At first glance ,   ( 21 ) seems to provide a perfectly reasonable analysis of  ( 19 )  . PROMISE and PERSUADE share an object , a subject , and a verb complement . The verb complements have different subjects as a result of the different control equations for PROMISE and PERSUADE  ( The lexical entry for PROMISE specifie subject control  ( 1' VCOMPSUBJ )  =  ( ~SUBJ )  , while PERSUADE specifies object control ( 1' VCOMPSUBJ )  =  ( ~' OBJ ) ) . 
There is no inconsistency , incompleteness or incoimrence in this structure . 
However , in LFG the completeness conditions apply to the fstructures mapped from all the c-structure nodes  , whether or not they are part of the structure corresponding to the root node  . And if we look at the f-structure that corresponds to the verb-complement node  , we discover that it is incomplete : ( 22 ) fRED'GO ( \[\]> 3\]pu . JpRE0 Wu . 
This f-structure is the generalization of ( s VCOMP ) for the set given in ( 21 )  . Everything that the two VCOMPs have in common is given by this f-structure ? HO wever  , it is incomplete in a very important way : the subject of the f-structure has no predicate  . This is the " semantic completeness " condition of LFG  , which requires that every thematic function of a predicate must itself have a predicate  . If the VCOMPs had had a subject in common ( as in the sentence The girlurged and persuaded Johntogo  ) then the sentence would have been perfectly legal . 
Interactions with Long-Distance Dependencies Under certain circumstances a shared constituent plays different roles in the conjoined constituents  . For instance , in ( 23 ) The robot is the object for Bill gave Mary , and it is the oblique object for John gave abail to  .

I , fact , ther , tnnber of roles that the head of a relative clause can play is  theoreticall3 mfl ) omale CTo deal with the ~ ; epossibilities , the notion of functio ~ u ~ luncertainty has been introd  , med into i . FO theory (/ Kaplan and Zaenenin press / , /Kaplau and Maxwell 1988/) . With flmctional uncertainty the attribute o1' a functional equation is allowed 1o consist of u ( possibly in finite ) regular . '; el of attribute strings . For instance , normally the role that a cnn stituet Jt plays in the tL qtructure is given by a simple equation such as  ( 25 ) :  ( 25 )   ( /' ~ o ~ , J ) :-feA functionally uncel'tain equation that couhl be used to express the relationship between the head of a relative clause and the role that it plays i  . the ( luuse might look like ( 26 ) :  ( 26 )   ( f ~ coMp':' ( a , ') :-/' ~ l';quation(2(;) say . ' ; that the fuuctional relationship between ft and \[  ) could con . s is ; of any number of comes t bllowed by a grammatical fnnctian  , sue q as SUBJ or Old . 
The definition of fnuctiorml uncertainty given by Kaplan and Zaenen  ( in press ) is essentially as follows: ( 27 ) lfa is a regular expression , then ( f a ) = v holds l and only if ( ( fa ) Surf ( a , a )) = v for some symbol a , where Suff(a , a ) is the set of suffix strings y such that a y ( u . 
We will not discuss functional uncertainty further in this paper  , except to show how it fits into out " model for sets To achieve the proper interaction between sets and regular expressions  , we merge ( 27 ) witb ( 16 ) :  ( 28 )   ( so ) : : v := IT ( fia )  , for all fiEs = II((fiai ) Surf(au )) , for all fi<s Alh ) wiug dif C crentai to be chosent breach fi provides the variation needed lot  ( 23 )  . The uncertainty can be ~ ealized by a different lhnetional path in each of the coordinated elmnents  , but the uncertainty must be res ( flved somehow in eacb clement and Uf is accounts for the Sunliar Acrosstim Board and Coordinate Structure Constraints  . 
l ~ e presenting the Col * junction
We have not yet indicated how the identity of the particular conjunction is represented  . If we look at rule (14) again , we notice that it is rnissing any equation to tell us how the f-structure for CONJ is related to ~:  ( 29 ) V - ; VCONJV , l , ~1"?;(tIt " we replace the ? with 1~=~ , then the f-structure tbrCON , I will be identified wiih the set corresponding to  1'  , which will have the effect of distributing all of its information across the fstructures corresponding to the onjoi~ed verbs  . As was pointed out to us by researchers attile University of Manchester  ( UM1ST )  , this arrangmnent leads to inconsistencies when coordinations of ' different types  ( and vs . or ) arc mutually end ) cd de d . On the other hand , if we replace the ? with $ E1' , then the f-structure tbrCONJ will be another element of tile set  , on a par with the f . .strnctures corresponding to the conjoined verbs . This is clearly counterintuitive and also erroneously implies that the shared elements will be distributed across the conjunction as well as the elements of the set  . 
We observe , however , that the identity of the particular conjunction does not seem to enter into any syntactic ort imelanai generalizations  , and therefor: . ' , that there is no motivation fro ' including it in the functional structure at all  . Instead , it is necessary to encode this h/errant on only on the semantic level of representation  , as defined by as : emantics t , rltctural correspondence or " prn jeetion "/ Kaplan 1987/  . A projection is a piecewise fimction mapping from the units of one kind of structure to the urt its of another  . The projection that is most central to I , FG theory is the 0 projection , the one that maps from constituent structure nodes into functional structures  . But other projections arc being introduced into I , FG theory so that generalizations about various other subsystems of linguistic information can be formalized  . In particular , /\[ lalvorsen and Kaplan 1988/have discussed the oprojection that maps frmn fstructures into a range of semantic structures  . Given the projection concept , the various linguistic levels can be related to one another through " codescription "  , that is , the equations that describe the mapping between gstructures and s-structures  ( semantic structures ) are generated in terms of the same c-structure no deconfigurations as the equations that map between c-structures and fstructures  . This means that even though the s-structure is mapped from the f-structure  , it may contain irf formation that is not computable from the f-structure but is strongly correlated with it via codescription  . We exploit this possibility to encode the identity of the conjunction only in semantic strnctll rC  . 
Consider a modified version of ( 29 ) that has equations describing the semantic structures corresponding to the f-structure units  :   ( 30 ) Y - -> VCONJVO\]v ~ ( O ' ~ ARGS )   ( O1'REL ) = o ~ , o  ~ ( \[ ( O ~ ARGS ) Rule ( 30 ) says that the unit of semantic structure corresponding to the f-st ~  , ucture of the conjoined verb contains the conjunction as its main relation  ( RI , ; L ) , plus an ARGS set that is made tip of the semantic structures corresponding to the individual V's  . The semantic structure generated by ( 30 ) is something like this : It describes the conjoined verb as a relation  , aND , which is applied to a set of arguments consisting of the relation SI  , EEI ' and the relation EAT . 
Each of these relations also has arguments , the semantic structures corresponding to the shared subject and object ef the sentence  . Notice how this structure differs from the one that we find at the functional level  ( e . g .  (13)) . Rule ( 30 ) does not assign any functional role to the conjunction  , yet althenecessary syntactic and semantic information is available in the complex of corresponding structures assigned to the sentence  .
