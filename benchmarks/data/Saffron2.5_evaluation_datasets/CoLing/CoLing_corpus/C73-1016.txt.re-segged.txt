1. ATREATMENTOFINDEPENDENTSEM ANTICCOMPONENTS
To distinguish things , we use terms which characterize them for us . 
For two balls it may be their color , for two people it may be their height , or their manner of speaking . In order to illustrate the differences in meaning for many words J  . j . KATZ and J . A . FODOR ( 1963 ) proposed the use of " semantic haracteristics " . They give an example for the meanings of man and ball:man-  .   .   .  -  ( physical object )  - -  ( human )  -  ( adult )  - -  ( male ) ball ~-- .   .   .  -  ( social activity )  - -  ( large )  - -  ( assembly ) ball ~- .   .   . -( physical object ) D . BOLINGER ( 1965 ) proposed the systematizing of these characteristics  , with hierarchic structures , so that the meaning of the word bachelor could be represented by a row of characteristics  ( fig .  1) . 
bachelor human ~--, . an ~ nalmale " ~"" ~" ~'- ~ educ and phocizmadult military hierarchichirs ute nonbecoming hierarchic permanent male unmated noble inferior a dult inferior young dependent nubile proximate unmated young ~ g  . l . 
Here the meaning of a word is given by a refering it to other words  . 
These words , in their turn , can be referenced by other words . There is the feeling that from here endless references will originate  . 
Let us suppose that there are a number of elementary characteristics which cannot be expressed in other characteristics  . We shall call ~ mmiP . lmWlmalr"uamm=-~""=,=--,~~w ~__ ~ .   .   .   .  - -  .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .

We shall represent the meaning of a word by the intensity of the presence of specific characteristicser If we construct a model in an / -dimensional vector space with unit-vectors _el  . . . _eiwe may represent the meaning of a word or expression W by the vector W = wx_e ~+  w2_e  ~ +  . . . + + w~z with w~>O for i = 1 . . . L The common in the meaning of two words is the sum of the common in each of the basis characteristics  . 
In our model this is for the vectors

For I = 2 refer to fig . 2.

For the determination of the norm of the vectors we consider that the common of V and W is determined via their characteristics  . Our consciousness can evaluate the factors v ~ and w ~ only one by one  . Therefore we put as norm : !
IIv i i = v , .

There with is ! lien_wll = i ~ l , by definition called the measure Of association between_V and W  . 
( rain is the minimum-function , e . g . rain (5, 7) = 5) . 
To test this model we designed two tests ( G . J . VAN , r ~ rSTE~N , '1971) . 
In the first test , individuals are asked to write down 12 words , starting with the word bird , and , relative to the associations between them , to indicate the measure of the association . This has to be a number between 0 and 10 ; '0' for : " no association " ,  '  10' for : " syn-ATREATMENTOFINDEPENDENTSEMANTIC COMPONENTS  203 onym " . For an example : see table 1 . For the Words W1 to WI ~ . in our model , we use the equations :
I (1) . ~ , rain(w'nl , , wn2 , ) = v , a , , , 2 i=1 for 1 < nl < N1 nl < n2 ~ < N ( here N = 12 ) where in the numbers v , l , , 2 are given . From these equations the unknowns wni(i = 1, . . . . 1; n = 1 .   .   .   . , N ) have to be solved . At the same time , the number of characteristics I has to be determined  . An upper limit for I is the number of equations : each association runs over a separate characteristic  . 
We determine I and the unknown wn ? by an iteration-process  . 
Suppose that the factors wn~(1~<n~<N ; 1 ~< i<I1) are determined (/1 = 1 ,  2 . .1-1) . Then we may write: , , c~ , + 1) = vii , )(1~< nl~N-l , nl < n2~<N ) rain(wnlz : , wn21) + V nl , n2nl , n2 with vm and , , re+l ) = ( wnl , wn2) . nl , n2 ~ l ) nl , n2 Vnl , n2 . ~ , rain i=I~+1 Let us denote the sum of all v's in step/1 q - 1 with S , so
N 1 N
S = . ~  . ~  , ,(~'+~) ~ nl , n 2 nl = l n2=nl+l To minimize I we try to solve the system with S as small as possible  . By successively assuming that a specific wn , , is the smallest of all wn ,   1 's we can determine for each of the suppositions the sum S  . 
We choose now the wn , 1 which belongs to the smallest sumS . If there are more sums S with this value then there are more refined criteria available  . Suppose this is wnll cIn the equation rain ( wnl , l , wn2 , 1) q -! , ~ t1+11 = vl~0?~nl , n2nl , n2 ? we choose then wnl , ~= v , ,1 , 2 . " ~ I ') There with Vnl , ne "( Z '+ l ) = 0 . wn2z , will be determined later . 
In all equations where in w n l , ~appears v , l , , 2''(z'+1) can now be determined . 
In the remaining equations we now apply the same process till the restays at last one equation  , for instance ~(11+1)l ) ( lt)min(wn3iI , wn4 , )-q-" , 3 , ,~ =  . 3,, ~204GERTJ . VANDER $ TEEN Here we choose wn 3 , ,----wn41 ,  =  , ' , 3 , , , 4 . ~' ( I ' ) There with our iteration step for I1 has been ended . When all vc ~ , + l )___0 then I----I1 and the whole-ni , nj iteration-process has come to an end . 
The process is illustrated in table 2 for 4 words with associations Vl , ~ = 3 , Vl , 3 = 6 , Vl , 4 = 8 , v ~ , 3 = 2 , v ~ , t = 4 and va , 4=5 ( randomly chosen ) . With si we denote the sum which belongs to a wi which appears in a line with the lowest v  . 
With some small modifications this solution-scheme can be used also if some equations have been deleted in the beginning  ; in others words : when some associations are not given  . This is illustrated in table 3 with the same v's as in table 2  , except for v l , 3 which is omitted . 
The small modification concerns the calculation of si : we divides i by the number of lines minus  1 in which wj . appears . 
Wcn owtry our model by omitting some of the given associations from one individual  . According to the foregoing method we determine the number of characteristics I and the vector -representations of the words  . From them we calculate the omitted associations with the aid of formula  ( 1 )  . For the discrepancies between the thus predicted and the omitted associations we can determine statistically an estimation  . 
If the associations are randomly given then the mean and the stan-dard-deviation do agree indeed with their calculated values  . If the associations are given by test-persons these numbers are significantly lower  . 
There are interesting discrepancies if associations are left out which express an extra aspect of meaning  . In a specific case the words bird , leg , table and chair were given among others . If the association between leg and bird was left out an association of  0 was predicted , as it should be . The number of characteristics was decreased by one  . 
The evaluation of associations between given words by test-per-sons is subjective  . This , however , plays no role here : the relations between a number of consciousness-contents are concerned  . If the test-individual is not consistent in his evaluations then the discrepancies between the given and the predicted associations become greater  . In practice there seems to be a good correlation of consistency in evaluation and the intelligence -level of the test-person  . 
On a more reliable level are the extended observations of the language expressions of a test-individual  . For this purpose a second test was designed . As source material 20 pages of the novel Deverliezers of Anna Blaman were taken  . With the aid of the programming language A TREATMENTOFINDEPENDENTSEM ANTICCOMPONENTS  205 SNOBOL a frequency-table was made for all words in that piece " of the text  . From them 20 words with a high frequency were chosen which are relevant wkh regard to each other  . Then it was determined how many times each of the  20 words was found together with each of the other words in the same sentence  . This number was taken as a measure of the associations between the words  . If we leave out the 0-as-sociations and predic their associations by the method of the first test our model will not be unreliable if we predict he value  0  . 
Indeed , it appears that there are O's predicted , except in associations between ouns and the words mine and your which give values  2 and 3  , and some , randomly distributed , exceptions . The method of prediction of 0-associations was chosen to avoid the rather crude measure of association  . This measure was used because of the absence of a well-defined method to detect coherent subphrases  . If two words never occur together in a phrase they will certainly never appear in the same subphrase  . 
It will be interesting to try this model on the common usage of languages  . The obtained vector-representations can be transferred to other characteristic systems by means of matrix-manipulations  . A further extension lies in the determination f the representation f words in different natural anguages with a mutual comparison and eventual transformation of the representations  . The measure of association is critical here . This should be refined by using more knowledge about the syntactic structure of the sentences  . 
A further estriction lies in the number of developed characteristics  . 
For the first test this was approximately 13 , for the second approximately 76 . From these 76 , the first 20 were the most relevant . The remaining characteristics served more to compensate for several small discrepancies  . By chancing to a larger amount of language information the number of relevant characteristics will naturally increase  . 11 Programming languages used : PL/I , FORTRAN and SNOBOL
Machines used : mM360/65 and PDV-9.
