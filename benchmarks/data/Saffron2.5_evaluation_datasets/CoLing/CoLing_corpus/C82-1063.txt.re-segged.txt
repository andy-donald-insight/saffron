Methodology and results of complex computational analysis of present-day standard Czech are presented  . According to computer programmes various linguistic observations were achieved  , concerning especially dependency syntax . 

The aim of this paper is to present the methodology and results of a detailed analysis of syntactic structures in Czech  , performed with the aid of computer . This work is a part of a large and longterm project  , known as Quantitative analysis of present-day standard Czech  , which is carried out in the Department of mathematical linguistics at the Czech language Institute under the leadership of M  . T ~ itelova ~1~,\[2\] . Some hither to achieved results have already been published in special monographs/e  . g . the frequency dictionaries of publicist and administrative styles  \[31  , t4\] , a volume of quantitative characteristics of publicist style  \[5\]- these prints were issued by the Czech language Institute  , Prague/or as articles and papers e . g . in PBML 31 and 32\[6\] and PSML7 and 8tT\] ; other articles are to be published within a short time/ase  . g . the frequency dictionary of scientific Czech / or they have been already prepared for publication  . 
PROPOSITIONS AND SYNTACTICCODE
The target of the syntactic analysis as well as of the whole project is to obtain a coherent set of mutually related quantitative parameters concerning the Czech language system  , its functioning in different communicative spheres  , as well as its stylistic va-lues . To guarantee the reliability and representativeness of results  , the research is based on the corpt ; sof 540   000 wordforms/occurrences/chosen from non-narrat ive/i  . e . newspaper , administrative and scientific/texts . During the preparatory works all word--forms in 180 samples-each sample consisting of 3000 running wordforms-were supplied with a special code carrying both morphological and syntactic information about parts of speech  , all main morphological categories , relevant in Czech/such as case , nominal gender and number , person , number , tense , mood , voice of verbs etc . with a very detailed subcategorization / and all main syntactic categories/such as subject  , object , predicate , attributes types of adverbials etc . , again with the necessary subcategories / . 
The syntactic code was basically digital , with three exceptions : the characters "+" and "- " expressed whether the dependent senten-ce element follows or precedes the governing word / sentence member /  , and the character "!" was used for special defective sentence constructions  . For purposes of frequency lists , each wordform was given a basic lexical information/lemma /  . 
The coding and lemmatization was done by Linguists in such a way  , that after marking boundaries between sentences and clauses each wordform was given information about its syntactic function /" membership in sentence "/ and about its governing word in the dependency tree  . Each clause was then given information about its structural position in the complex or compound sentence ~ then coordination between words or between clauses was marked  ; finally , information about the linear arrangement of words in sentences  , of clauses in complex and compound sentences , and of sentence who-les in text was added , so as to enable the complete reconstruction of running texts by computer  , if necessary , at any time . 
The whole corpus together with the encoded info rmation came by means of punched cards  /80 columns/over a current input programme into external computer memory on magnetic tapes / each tape Library can carry max  . 30 texts , the whole corpus is contained in 7 tapes / . 
Each record got a special translation zone to guarantee the possi-bility of obl igatory/non-standard/sorting with respect to diffe-rent alphabetic order ing of some Czech Letters/record size on ta -peis  130  , block size BS=6502/ . The automatic processing has been executed at the computer TESLA  200 in the computer-centers OTZ ~ HT and OFPL , Czechos Lovak Academy of Sciences , all programmes and COMPUTATION ALDATAAN ALYSIS FORSYNTAX  393 their modifications were written in internal programming language " APS "  . 
The survey of the main results , given below , is ordered from the most simple to the more complicated ones  , with respect to the computer programmes and with respect to the linguistic information obtained  . 
SIMPLE COMPUTATION ALCHAR ACTERISTICS
The first set of programmes gives by its simple structure as to the programming technique the essential totals of frequencies/occurrences / of encoded syntactic categories  , individual syntactic features and various items under investigation  . Number of results of this kind was obtained by means of reading or repeated reading of the magnetic tape library and through simple adding of different code items  . 
The received data offer us a basic survey about the frequencies of sentence elements and simple  , complex and compound sentences , about types of syntagms/both determinative and coordinative /  , about the frequencies of two-element and one -element sentences and their patterns  , about the frequencies of types of subordinate clauses  , some word-order and clause-order characteristics and the frequency ratio of simple and complex /compound sentences  . In addition , there have been collected some data concerning how often various sentence elements are expressed by a nominal or an adver-bial phrase and how often they are expressed by a dependent clause  , concerning the most frequent types of complex sentences  , including frequencies and functions of various syntactic connectors  . Using the cycles within counting programmes the distributions of syntactic units were obtained in a similarly simple and prompt way  . 
This part of the computer work yielded the length distributions of clauses and sentences expressed in number of words  , or in number of clauses . 
COMPOUND COMPUTATION ALCHAR ACTERISTICS
By doubling or chaining of testing subprogrammes and cycles another set of programmes was constructed for more complicated searching and output of syntactic characteristics  . Specially commented tab-394 L . UHLll ~ OV ?, I . NEBESK/~ and J . KR  ~ , LIKles , as well as larger sets of numeric data supplying rich material for further steps of analysis were obtained  . Whereas the results of the programme set mentioned above referred to frequencies of individual syntactic categories  , the programmes reported about in this paragraph were concentrated on their relationships  . Attention was paid especially to the relationships between syntactic elements and their part-of-speech appurtenance  , to the syntactic relevance of some morphological categories / e  . g . of noun cases / , to the correlation between sentence length and complexity of its structure  , to the relationship between types of subordinate clauses and their linear position in complex sentences etc  . Some of the statistical data obtained have confirmed our intuitive expectations/e  . g . concerning syntactic functions of parts of speech and syntactic functions of cases of nouns /  , others lead us to a deeper insight into interrelations between linguistic levels  , esp . about the connection between the lexical and the syntactic levels  . 
TYPES OF VERBAL CONTEXTS SEARCHED BY COMPUTER Using the computer operation memory we overcame the technical im-possibitity of a reverse magnetic tape reading  . This enabled us to prepare the third set of output we received whole nents with required code programmes with many variations  . As an sentences , sentence types or their compo-combinations or with immediate verbal contexts  . Thus we could study not only abstract syntactic categories as such  , reported above , but we also could take into account the concrete lexical manifestations of various syntactic elements  , units and categories . 
Some interesting tendencies were found , concerning the insertion of certain lexical types into different syntactic positions  , e . g . 
types of adjectives typical for predicative posit ions and other typical for attributive positions  . The relationship between the semantics of the coordinated syntactic elements and their functions in topic comment structure was studied  , the correlation between the frequencies of subordinate clauses and lexical semantics of the governing predicate was proved/with predicates expressing the attitude of the speaker to the content of communication /  , the correlation between morphological category of infinitive and semantic category of modality was found  . A special attention was COMPUTATION ALDATA ANALY SISF ORSYNTAX  395 paid to the syntactic structures with verbs to be and to have  . 
MAIN RESULTS ANDPERSPECTIVES
The hither to made experiences have shown that even a very extensi-ve statistico-linguistic project can be successfully carried through  , if ~ here is the aid of computer . Results obtained up to now offer a very detailed picture about the functional load of syntactic elements and units in texts from various styles and from various communicatives pheres of the present-day Czech  . However , the importance of the project , which has not yet been completely finis-hed , consists also in the recognition and understanding of quantitative linguistic principles  , relationships , tendencies and general laws . 
Statistics of syntax contrasts by some of its features with the statistics of other linguistic levels  . If compared with some hierarchically lower levels  , such as with phonology or morphology , and their units , the sentence as the basic syntactic unit is structurally much more complex/not representing the mere summof elements and forms of the lower levels/and  , larger , too . For these reasons it disposes with a considerably higher combination possibilities  , and consequently of richer posibilities of individual usage of linguistic means of its creation and usage during the communicative process  . On the other hand , if compared with concrete lexical items , most properties of sentence are of abst-ract , categorial nature ; the inventory of sentence patterns is strictly limited in number  , and therefore they are repeated very often in texts  , which of course contributes to the neutralizat ion of their st ~ listic value  . 
The computer aided quantitative analysis of syntax proved to be a valuable counterpart of qualitative structural research in descri-bing and evaluating the functioning of language means in communication  .
