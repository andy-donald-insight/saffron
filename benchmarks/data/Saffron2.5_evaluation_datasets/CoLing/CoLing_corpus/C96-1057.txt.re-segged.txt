Abstract
~ i % xt understanding and high quality
machine translation often necessitate
the disambiguation of ambigous truc-
tures or lexical elements . Drawing in-
ferences from the context can be a
means for resolving semantic ambigu-
ities . However , often , this is an ex-.
pensive strategy that , in addition , not
always comes up with a clear prefer-
encefor one of the alternatives . In
this paper , we argue that in a num-
ber of cases deep semantic analyses can
be avoided by taking into account the
constraints that the alternative readings
impose onto the information structure.
To this end , we present a study of the
arn bigous German adverberstand point
out the particular circumstances under
which the given information structure
disambiguates the adverb without fur-
ther semantic analysis.
1 Introduction
German erst is ambigous . Consider the following

(1) Peterzeigteer stauf die vierte Gliickszahl.
a ) Unddann auf diezweite.
( Peter first pointed to the fourth lucky number.
And then to the second.)
b ) Nichtzuvor auf die erste , zweiteoder dlqtte .

Not to the first , second or third . ) c ) Noehniehtauf die Nnfte . 
(Peter only pointed to the fourth lucky number so far  . Not yet to the fifth . ) The alternative contexts a ) - e ) determine the meaning of the first sentence of ( 1 ) according to * This paper describes research done within the Sonderforschuns bereich  3~0 at IMS . I would like to thank Anette Frank , Hans Kamp , Michael Schiehlen and the other members of the IMS semantics group for help full discussion  . 
the disambiguating translations presented . ' rhe example testifies the following three uses of crsl : ? In the context  ( 1 . a ) , the recipient understands the introduced event as the first of a sequence of events that he expects to be completed by the following text  . We call this reading : the First of a Sequence -reading  ( FS )  . 
? In the context (1 . b ) , the recipient understandsers t as a signal of the speaker/writer that the occurrence of the reported event is not preceded by the occurrence of similar  ( alternative ) events . We call this reading : the Exclusion of Preceding Alternative s-reading  ( EPA )  . 
? In the context (1 . c ) , the recipient understands the event as element of a sequence of events  , and the realization of the sequence , in particular the reported realization of the event at the textual perspective time  , seems to be in retardation , with regard to some ( previous ) expectation about the realization dates of the sequence  . We call this reading : the Retardation-reading ( R )  . 
As can be seen from the example , the contextual disambiguation not only is needed for understanding the text  , but is a prerequisite for high quality translation  . 
In the literature , different lbrmalizations have been discussed ( ( KSn79 )  , ( LSb 89) , ( Kgn 91) ,   ( HR 81 )   ( the latter one for the similar no ch and sch on ) and others )  . With respect o the focus adverb use ( the cases ( 1 . b ) and (1 . c ); (1 . a ) being an example of the temporal adverb use ) , rnod-ellings are prevailing that associaters * with different scales  ( cf . (I~5b89)) . However , a precise evaluation of the context that can decide about the relevant reading  ( for instance , what information defines which scale ) is still missing . We tackle this problem in the framework of Discourse Representation Theory  ( DRT )   ( Kam 81 )  , assuming that discourse representations ( DRSs ) may be augmented by information structure .

( Lev8a ) for ~ m overview of the notions used , the tests associated with them and the problems connected to them  )  . We directly come up with tile I ) RSs that , to our opinion , represc . n the impact of the different remdings . We begin with the

With respect to the representation and resolution of presuppositions in DR/F  , we relate to ( vdS92) . We slightly deviate from the approach suggested there  , however , in that we use a notation for the llresui ) position triggers that is akin to the suggestion o f  ( BgS+94 ) : we use so-calle<\[~-condilions which describe the presupposed objects and their characterization  .

2 . 2 The Exclusion of Preceding Alternatives i n te r p retation In tile EPA-reading  , crsl is used ms a focus md verb , i . e . it structures its argument into focus and background  . In the following representation of ( l ) , wc consider the case where the numeral ix focused only  , not the NP containing the numeral or the entire event description in the scope of crM :  ( t % peter now ~ . ~ . , Te 4

sisting of a sequence of events el-ek that are related via a nonfln'ther specified relation  1  . to l ) redicates I ' ~- l ) ~ . The seIt ' ; are required to be alternatives of the event descriptiou in the scope of crst  ( whic . his called / ~ e . I)RS ~) . In this paper , we cannot go into detail with the computation of the alternatiw : s of event descriptions  . Pi6ALTD , t&,whereAlfF,)ltS=Ac . Dte , c;~\[~ , ~o(:o , (~t~s , OtO\]\]QAlfI'(l"O (7~ , t(l)R . ,~e )) , sketches the claim that the Pi are ( ; vent descriptions that developfl : omAe .

(~2 ) ror the underlying focus theory and ( BE 95 ) for an algorithm that calculates the concrete alternatives  )  . As mentioned , the focused elemeut , which is marked by the underline , is assumed to be the numeral adjective . This choice triggers the structuring of the Ps into the brock-ground event type $ c  . 13 AO(I)\[L % . ) ( which is k e .  ~2 . uf ( pet et lx )  \] ) and the fo ( : used semantic constituent lx . l;~O(/(DR , S'e ) \[4 ln\] ( which is from the set of alternatives of 4 )  . The relation R has to be understood as characterizing the ei as opportunities for Peter to point to  ( specific ) numbers . In (1) , these opportunities may be situations that Call be described by : The firsle ~/ second ~/ lhird ~ number is presented to Peter  . Tile order of the oppertunities i inherited from the order of the Ps  , -< o , which conforms to the intrinsic order of the set of Mternatives of the focused element  ( i . e . 
O=order(ALT(FOC~ . I(DI~S ~)))) . In (1) , this is the canonical order of the numbers . 
The negation test , which is comln only used to detect presuppositions  , upports theses true turM assumptions . 
Now , we think that the EPA-reading inter-pretestile asserted event  , which is backed by the described scenario , as the lirst one that ; is indeed realized within the range of possible instantiations that the sequence of opportunities provides  , i . e . 
the asserted event presents the first positive outcome totile test about the instantiation of the Ae  . BAC ( DRS~ ) -type that is connected to the ei-sequence , where each test situation el is characterized by its own specific additional test criterion kx  . FO ( ; (1) I?Se)\[41n\]'2 Further linguistic tests , that we must omit here , support the assumption that the information about the negative tests is an entailment  . Therefore , in the representation , the negated DRSs for the pointing-opportunities l-  e3 are part of the main DRS . 
In the literature the representation of the fo- ( ' using use of ersl ( and corresponding uses of no ch and sch on ) often comprises the information that tile reported reMization of the event is earlier or later  ( depending on the reading and the adverb ) than the speaker/writer and/or the recipient ( or even a third person ) would have expected . We think that such an expectation , in the case of the EPA-reading of erst , is only optional . Following ( K6n91) , we think that , if present , it is not a presupposition but a conventional implicature  . 
In (1 . b ) , we use the specific c~i , ,~ , l-format and the representation convention of ( Ram 95 ) for attitudinal states in order to express the EPA-expectation of a previous test to be successful  . 
2 . 3 The Retardation i n te rpreta t ion As for the EPA-reading  , we consider the case where tile numeral is focussed only :  2Depending on the tocus structure of tile phrase in the scope of erst in  ( 1 ) and depending on the contex-tuM restrictions of the admissible alternatives  , other sets of Ps might result . It is clear that depending on this choice , the focus conditions may characterize a thematic role  . , as in the described example , or the event wriable . It is ~ dso clear , as we will argue in the next section , that not all of these sets of alternatives can accept the El~A-reading  .

Ottmpl ( . ~: A'PT(~<lt\] , : L , I ~* l >4) In contrast to the EPA-reading , we assume that , in the R-reading , the predicates Pi that we obtain from the information structure of the erst-argument are not related to a sequence of opportunities for doing something  , but describe events ei of an expectation about the ongoing of the world or a plane  . The context ( 1 ) doesn't provide fin:-tiler information about the identity of the person or persons X to whom the introduced attitudinal state has to be ascribed  , to the speaker/writer , to the recipient , to Peter , to someonelse or to some group of salient people  . Also it doesn't provide information about the nature of the attitude MOI  )  . 
The conditions that are introduced below the clot -tedline exemplify possible resolutions  . According to this , Peter and the speaker/writer ( i for the distinguished I ) I . F for the self ) share the attitud ( ; of having a plan for realizing // . Such resolutions may be available by an inference component that operates over richer contextual knowledge  . Ag ~ fin , tile order of the Pi and tile corresponding ei is inferred from the implicit or  ( ler of the alternatives of the focused element , l , ' rom this setting and the assertion of an occurrence of Peter pointing to the fourth lucky number at the temporal perspective t  , the representation entails reMizations of those events of the presupposition line that precede the counterpart of e in the presupposed sequence  . As a further ( possibly option M ) constrain; , the l~-reading introduces the implicature that a noi ~ further specified person or grout  ) ~cx-or expected sequence of events shou hlbe realized to a greater degree  . Without further information about the identity of  ~  , it is ditll cult to say something more precise about the tempor M location of the ~- expectation than that an instances ' of the corresponding attitudinal state holds at some time

3 Disarn biguating Criteria 3 . 1 Tim Syntax Criterion In ( . ; crman focus adverl ) s cannot be topic Mized as such , i . e . they cannot occur in the vorfeld position without an accompanying constituent  ( cf . 
( KSn !) l )) . If th (' . sentences n ) ws such a topicalization o\['ersl--which is marked by the inversion of the basic Subj-Vlin -order-ersl can only be used as a time adverb  , i . e . its meaning can only be the li'S-reading , as exemplitied by ( 2 ) :  ( 2 ) Erstg ' abPeter Maria den Brief .

The F , l ~ A-reading is a c ('( ; l~tM ) h ~ only if the SCO l ) C of c , rst is structured into focus and bac . k grouml in such a way that the background is a specitic event type  . 
3 . 3 The T (: nqmralLocationCrlte . ri ( m'l'heR-readingi ) resul ) poses a sequence of events ( concel ) tuMized as a plan or an expectation about the ongoing of the world  ) and it assumes that , fl ' om the t ) erspective of the contextual l ) ersl ) eCl , ivetime , a part of the sequence is reMized , at . cording to the ordering of the plan or expectation  . The rel ) orted event refers to the event of the presul ) l ) Osition line that marks the boundary l ) (%wcen the instantiated nnd tire nol>instantiated event cou-cepts  , and it ; does this in right thes atlle way as delinite descriptions do with resl  ) ect to their ml-tecedents . Now , if this is true and it ' the ev(ml ; descrit)tion contains at eml , or M location hit . hc focus , this information cannot be used at t , ' ibutively , because it contributes to the antecedenL defi'om its alternatives  . Because of this setting , it acts as a restriction on the referring expression that helps to pick up the right antecedent from the presupposition line  . This means that , against the background of the presupposition , this information is not new . We add that nothing of the ersg argument is new information agains this background  . New is the information about the progress of the instantiation of the presupposed event concepts  . But then , stating that an event of the corresponding antecedent type indeed was realized  ( the assertional impact of the R-reading )  , and stating that it occurred at a time as was expected  ( consequence of the specific description of ' antecedent ' and ' anaphor '  )  , and simultaneously in sinuating that it could have been realized earlier  ( presuppositional structure of the R-reading supported by intplicature  ) results in a contradiction . 
This , to our opinion , seems to be the explanation of why the I-reading is not possible in case the description in the scope of erst comes with a temporal location in the foens  . Compare the following examl > les to this end . 
(5) Petrawariiber rascht , wella ) Peterer stOn\[Stuttgart\]\]+ , war ) ( R)b ) Petererst(urn\[12 . 00\]vin Stuttgartwar ) * ( R )   ( 5 ) confirms what we have said so far . Note , by the way , that the features of the Focus-Backgronnd -criterion are not characteristic of the R -reading  . 
What about temporal locations in the background part ? At first glance  , it seems that what we have said above applies to this case also  . How = ever , there are some ( relatively marginal ) cases that possibly contradic to this assumption . The following example ( 6 ) is an instance of this: ( 6 )   .   .   . well Peterers t ( in\[Mfinchen\]vum3e in Bierge trunken hat )   ( be ?: anse only in Munich , Peter drank abeer at tt ~ ree ( sofa ~ ) ) In a context that ; continues this information , for instance , by und nochnicht in Kb'ln ( amndchsten 7' ag ) um3/ and not * , let in ( Jolo . qne ( lhenext day ) al3 the R-reading seems acceptable . Because of the granularity of the presuppositional event sequence that develops from the presupposition con-strnction in such cases-in  ( 6 )  , the iteration must satisfy to a one-day-rhythmat least-the temporal adjunct cannot truly act  , as a restrictive referential constraint , and be can se of what we have said above about novelty  , it is not the best attributive information also . This may explain why the example is felt to be a bitod d  . The decisive feature , however , why the above argumentation for the incompatibility of the R-reading and the presence of tempora localizations does not go through  , is the fact that the background temporal localization does not uniquely\[ix the occurrence time of the event with regard to the time fralne of the presupposed plan or expectation  . This , of course , is so , only if the localizing predicate allows for multiple  ( periodic ) instantiation . ( Times of day allow for this , also adjuncts like after lunch etc . ) . 
We stress that what we have said relates to temporal adjuncts in tiles cope of erst  . The following (7 . a ) allows for the R-reading , because the most natural analysis gives wide scope to the temporal adjunct  , i . e . the sentence is analysed like (7 . h ) , where clearly , the adjunct serves to localize , the temporal perspective . 
(7) a ) Erst in Mi in chen warer gestern.
b ) weller gesterners t in Mi in & enwar.
( yesterday being in Munich )
We have considered only temporal adjuncts so far . The alternative temporal localization that occurs in the scope of erst is the construction ' CO l > = ula + predicative temporal expression '  , which accepts the R-reading . Examples are (4 . c ) and (4 . d) . 
We skip the complet explanatory argument here and just say that  ( grosso mode ) the function of the copula construction is to synchronize calendar knowledge  ( also information about different calen-dars : R -reading of  ( 4 . (1)) with the act nM available perspective times , whereas the function of the temporal adjunct is to relate the descibed event to some predefined time  . We take it for granted , that this difference is the reason why the decisive conflict that we mentioned fllrther a bow ' ~ only arises if the tempor M location is introduced by modification  , i . e . in case it is introduced by an adjunct . 
We retain the following criterion :

The R-reading is acceptable only if the focus constituent of the scope of erst does not contribute a tempora localization  ( by modification of a basic event type )  . In addition , the scope must not contain an adjunct-focused or not-that is a uniquely referring temporal location  ( like yesterday )  . 
3.4 The Entaihnent Criterion
Compare the following examples : (8) .   .   . wella ) Toml , a ~ id ~ er~t(a , aer\[St , 'eif~ , lml , ~ tte IF disqualigizierte ) . 
( T . disqualified himself at the S . )*( R ) , ( EPA)I , ) erst(\[drei\]F Unterschriften genfigten) . 
( three signatures were sntticient .)*( R ), ( gI?A).
e ) Petererst(\[vier\]r Angestelltekannte).
( P . knewfont'employees . )(I ),* ( EeA ) (8 . a ) cannot have the R-reading . Why ? The intelligent construction of the presuppositional sequence of events for the H  . -reading outputs a number of disqualification events that are located al  ; particular places of the Ilahnenkamm downhill race in Kitzb fihel  . What is specific with this sequence is the fact that the postconditions of any of these events are snch that the preconditions of the successive vents never can hold  . Therefore such a sequence can never be a reasonable plan or I  . e . a constitutive lement of the R-reading cannot h ( ; constructed in this ease . In (8 . 1 ) ) the descrip--tions of subsequent events ( states in this case ) of the presuppositional line are more gcner M predicates than the description of the predecessors  , i . e , each such sequence collapses in its tirst element in essen <  ; e . This cannot truly he called a sequence . 
With (8 . c ) , we encounter , so to speak , the symmetric picture with regard to the El ) A-reading : t ( no'wing n employees entails the previousy tested know in  ( tn-\[cmployccs . ' l ' heexl ) ('<' tation of some l ) rOl ) osition pt ; obe true in a specific situations , ~cannott > efalsilied , in case the wdidity of a parti<:-ular prol ) osition ( 1 in the subsequent test situation s~+l confirms the wdidity of p  . 
We retain the following criterion :

For the I , : reading to l ) e acceptable , first , the l ) ost : conditions of each event of the t > resupt ) ositional line mus the compatible with the preconditions of the successor and s <  ; cond , ( at least for homo- .

\[ , ' or the I , ; I ) A-reading to l > e acceptable ,   ( at least for homogeneous descriptions ) the event descril >- tiontested at a situation must not subsume the previously tested evt ' Att description  . 
There are refinements of this criterion that we tnust omit here  .
