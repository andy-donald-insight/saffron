we present an implelnented system for processing definite descriptions  . The system is based on the results of a corpus analysis previously reported  , which showed how common discourse-new descriptions are in newspaper corpora  , and identified several problems to be dealt with when developing computational methods for interpreting bridging descriptions  . The annotated corpus produced in this ear-licr work was used to extensively evaluate the proposed techniques for matchiug delinite descriptions with their antecedents  , discourse segmentation , recognizing discourse-new descriptions , and suggesting anchors for bridging descriptions . 
1 Motivation
In previous work ( Poesio and Vieira ,  1998 ) we reported the results of corpus annotation experiments in which the subjects were asked to classify lheuses of delinite descriptions in Wall Stree Journal articles according to a scheme derived from work by Hawkins  ( 1978 ) and Prince ( 1981  ) and including three classes : I ) III'~CTANAP ltORA , I ) ISCOURSE-NEW , and I~RIDGING DESCIII'TION ( Clark ,  1977) . 
This study showed that about half of the time , deli-nite descriptions are used to introduce a new entity in the discourse  , rather than to refer to an object already mentioned  . We also observed that our subjects didn't always agree on the classification of a given delinite  ; the problem was especially acute for bridging descriptions  . 
In this paper , we present an implemented system for processing delinite descriptions based on the re-suits of that earlier study  . In our system , techniques for recognising discourse-new descriptions play a role as iln portant as techniques for identifying the antecedent of anaphoric ones  . The system also incorporates robust techniques for processing bridging descriptions  . 
A fundamental characteristic of our system is that it was developed so that its perfomlance could be evaluated using the annotated corpus  . In the papm ; we discuss how we arrived at the optimal version of the system by measuring the performance of each method in this way  . Because of the problems observed in our previous tudy concerning agreement between annotators  , we evaluated the system both by measnring precision/recall against a ' gold standard ' and by meast u ' ing the agreement between the annotation it produces and them motators  . 
2 General Overview
At the moment , the only systems engaged in semantic interpretation whose performance can be evaluated onl ' a Myun restricted text such as the Wall Street Journal articles are based on a shallow -processing approach  , i . e . , that do not rely on extensive amounts of handcoded common sense knowledge  ( Carter , 1987; Appelt , 1995; Humphreys et al ,  1998) . I Our system is of this type : it only relies on structural information  , on the infommtion provided by preexisting lexical source such as WordNet  ( Fellbaum ,  1998) , on minimal amouuts of general handcoded iuformation  , and on information that can be acquired automatically from a corpus  . 
Although we believe that quantitative ewduations of the performance of a systeln on a large number of examples are the only true assessment of its performance  , and therefore a shallow processing approach is virtually unavoidable for implemented systems until better sources of common sense knowledge become available  , we do know that this approach liln-its the performance of a system on those instances of definite descriptions which do require common sense knowledge for their resolution  .   ( We grouped these in what we call the ' bridging ' chtss  . ) We I Most systems participating in the Message Understanding Conference  ( MUC ) evaluations are customized to specific do-nmins by adding handcoded common sense knowledge  . 
8 99 nevertheless developed heuristic techniques for processing these types of delinil cs its well  , which n/ay provide a baseline against which the hains in perfor--nlanco  ( \] lit to tilell SOoi:COlllnlOllSells e knowlodoe can be assessed more clearly  . 
Our system attempts to classify each deli-n it c description as either I  ) IRIX:TANAI'ItORA , I ) IS (' . ()UI ~, SIT , - NI '; W , all ( tIgRII)GINGI ) lv . S(21II'TION . 
The lirslchlss includes deihfite descriptions whose head is identical to thai  o1' their antecedent , as in a Iiouse . . . lhehouse ? The second includes del Linile descriptions that refer to objects not alma@ mentioned in the text and  , lot r clated to any such object .   ( Some of these finite descriptions refer to objects whose existence is widely known  , such as discourse-initial references to lhei ) ot ; e ; other instances of discourse-new descriptions refer to  o1:> jects thai can be assumed to b cunique , even if unfa~miliar , such as lhe . filwlwoman loclimball Scollish Mum'os . ) l q n all y , we classify as bridging descriptions all dcl in it c descriptions whose resolution de-  . 
pen(Is on knowledge of relalions between objects , such as delinite descriptions thai refer to an object rehlted  1o an entity a h'eady introduced in the dis--com'se by a relation other than identity  ( Prince's'inlerrables ' )  , as in the flat .   .   , the living , room ; and de/tulle descriptions that refer an object a headymtroduced  , but using a different predicate , as in I he car .   .   . lheve hicle , hi addition to this chlssitica-lion , the systemiries to identify the antecedents of anaphoric descriptions and the anchors  ( Fraurud , 1990) of bridging ones . Accordingly , we developed three types of heuristics : , for resolving directly anaphoric descriptions . 
These iuclude heuristics for dealing with see -mentation and to handle modificatiou  . 
? for identifying discourse-new descriptions.
Some of these heuristics attempt to recognize semantically lunctional definite descriptions  ( Hawkins , 1978; Loebner ,  1987) , whereas others try to recognize definite descriptions that are anchored via their modification  ( Clark and
Marshall , 1981; Prince , 1981).
, , for identifying the anchor of a bridging description and the semantic relation between the bridging description and its anchor  . WordNet is accessed , and heuristics for named entity recognition were also developed  . 
The final configuration of the system was arrived at on the basis of an extensive w fluation of the hemislics using I he corpus annotated in our previous work  ( Poesio and Vieira ,  1998) . The evaluation was used both io detemfine whMl version  o1' each heuristic worked belier , and to identify the best o1" , der in which to try them .

3.2 Heuristics for Recognizing Discourse-New

As mentioned above , a central characteristic of our system is that it also includes heuristics for recognising discourse-new descriptions  ( i . e . , definite descriptions that introduce new discoursentities  ) on the basis of syntactic and lexical features of the noun phrase  . Our heuristics are based on the discussion by Hawkins  ( 1978 )  , who identified a number of correlations between certain types of syntactic structure and discourse-new descriptions  , particularly those that he called ' unfamiliar ' definites  ( i . e . , those whose existence cannot be expected to be known outhe basis of generally shared knowledge  )  , including : ? the presence of ' special predicates':4 -the occurrence of premodifier such as first or best when accompanied with full relatives  , e . g . , the . \[ irs ' tpeJ wonto sail to America ( Hawkius calls these ' un-explanatory modifiers ' ; Loebner ( 1987 ) showed how these predicates may license the use of definite descriptions in an account of definite descriptions based on functionality  )  ; -a head noun taking a complement such as the fact that there is li\['e on Earth  ( Hawk in scalls this subclass ' Nt ' complements ' )  ; ? the presence of restrictive modification , as in the inequities of the current l and -ownership system  . 
Our system attempts to recognize these syntactic patterus  ; in addition , it considers as unfamiliar some definites occurring in  4This list was developed by hand ; more recently , Bean and Riloff ( 1999 ) proposed methods for autolnatically extracting fl ' oma corpu such special predicates  , i . e . , heads that correlate well with discourse novelty . 
? appositive coustructions ( e . g . , Glenn Cox , the president of Phillips Petroleum Co . ); * copular constructions ( e . g . ,the man most likely to gain custody of all this is a career politician named David Dinkins  )  . 
In our corpus study ( Poesio and Vieira ,  1998 ) we found that our subjects did better at ideutify -ing discourse-new descriptions all together  ( K = . 68 ) than they did at distinguish ' unfamiliar ' from ' larger situation '  ( Hawkins , 1978) cases ( K = . 63) . This finding was confirmed by our implementation : although each of the heuristics is designed  , in principle , to identify only one of the uses ( larger situation or unfamiliar )  , they work better when used all together to the class of discourse new descriptions  . 
The overall recall and precision results for the heuristics for identifying discourse new descriptions are shown in Table  3  . In this Table we do not distinguish between the two types of discourse-new descriptions  , ' unfamiliar ' and ' larger-situation ' . The column headed by ( # ) represents the number of cases of descriptions classified as discourse new in the standard annotation  ; + indicates the total number of discourse-new descriptions correctly identified  ; -then mnber of errors . These results are for the version of the system ( version 1 ) that uses the best version of the heuristics for dealing with anaphoric descriptions discussed above  , and that doesn't attempto resolve bridging descriptions  .

Table 3: Evaluation of the heuristics for identifying discourse new descriptions  3  . 3 Bridging Descriptions Bridging descriptions are tile class of definite descriptions which a shallow processing system is least equipped to handle  , and therefore the most crucial indicator of where common sense knowledge is actually needed  . We knew from the start that in general , a system can only resolve certain types of bridging descriptions when supplied with an adequate kuowledge base  ; in fact , the typical way of implementing a system for resolving bridging references has been to restrict tim domain and feed the system with handcoded world knowledge  ( see , e . g . , ( Siduei ; 1979) and especially ( Carter ,  1987)) . 

Furthermore , the relation between bridging descriptions and their anchors may be arbitrarily complex  ( Clark , 1977; Sidnm ; 1979; Prince , 1981; Strand ,  1996 ) and our own results indicate that the stone description may relate to different anchors in a text  , which makes it difficult to decide what the intended anchor and the intended link are  ( Poesio and Vieira ,  1998) . Nevertheless , we feel that trying to process these definite descriptions is the only way to discover which types of common sense knowledge are actually needed  . .
We began by developing a classilication of bridging descriptions according to the kind of information needed to resolve them  , rather than on the basis of the possible relations between descriptions and their anchors as usually done in the literature  ( Vieira ,  1998) . This allowed us to get an idea of what types of bridging descriptions our system might be able to resolve  . We classified definite descriptions as follows : ? cases based on well-delined lexical relations  , such as synonymy , hypernymy and meronymy , that can be found in a lexical database such as WordNet  ( Fellbaum , 1998) - as in the flat .   .   , lheliving room ; ? bridging descriptions in which the antecedent is a proper name and the description a common noun  , whose resolution requires some way o1' recognizing the type of object denoted by the proper name  ( as in Bach . . . the composer ) ; ? cases in which the anchor is not the head noun but a noun modifying an antecedent  , as in the compaw has been selling discount packages  . . . the discounts ? cases in which the antecedent ( anchor ) is not introduced by an NP but by avl ' , as in Kadaneoil is currently drilling two oil wells  . 
The activity ...
? descriptions whose the antecedent is not explicitly mentioned in the text  , but is implicitly available because it is a discourse topic-e  . g . , the industo , in a text referring to oil coml ) a-nies ; ? cases in which the relation with the anchor is based on more general common sense knowledge  , e . g . , about cause-consequence relations . 
We developed heuristics for handling the first three of these classes : lexical bridges  , bridges based on names , and bridges to entities introduced by nonhead nouns in a compound nominal  . We refer the reader to ( Vieira ,  1998 ) for discussion of the heuristics for this last class  . 
Our system attempts to resolve lexical bridges by consulting WordNet to determine if there is a semantic relation between the head noun of the description and the head noun of one of the NI'S in the previous five sentences  . The results of this search for our training corpus  , in which 204 descriptions are classified as bridging , are shown in Table 4 . It is interesting to note that the semantic relations found in this automatics emch were not always those observed in our manual analysis  .

We developed a simple heuristic method for assigning types to named entities  . Our method iden-titied entity types for 66% ( 535/814 ) of all names in the corpus ( organizations , persons and locations ) . 
The precision was 95% . We could have had a better recall if we had adopted more comprehensive lists of cue words  , or consulted dictionaries of names as done for the systems participating in  MUC6  . 
There , recall in the named entity task varies t'rom 82% to 96%  , and precision l'rom 89% to 97% .   5   4 Overall Evaluation of the System The order of application of heuristics is as impoftant as the heuristics themselves  . The final order of application was also arrived at on the basis of an extensive evaluation  ( Vieira ,  1998) , and is based on the l'ollowing strategy : 6   5A more recent version o1' the system using the named entity recognition software developed by It CRC for the  MUC7 competition ( Mikheevelal . , 1999) is discussed in ( Isbikawa , 1998) . 
a We also attempted to learn the best order of application of the heuristics automatically b means of decision tree learning algorithms  ( Quinlan ,  1993) , without however observing a signflicant difference in pcrfommnce  . See ( Vieira , 1998) for details .
