This paper proposes a new method for automatic acquisition of Chinese bracketing knowledge from EnglishChinese sentence-aligned bilingual corpora  . Bilingual sentence pairs are first aligned in syntactic structure by combining English parse trees with a statistical bilingual language model  . Chinese bracketing knowledge is then extracted automatically  . The preliminary experiments show automatically learned knowledge accords well with manually annotated brackets  . The proposed method is particularly useful to acquire bracketing knowledge for a less studied language that lacks tools and resources found in a second language more studied  . Although this paper discusses experiments with Chinese and English  , the method is also applicable to other language pairs  . 

The past few years have seen a great success in automatic acquisition of monolingual parsing knowledge and grammars  . The availability of large tagged and syntactically bracketed corpora  , such as Penn Treebank , makes it possible to extract syntactic structure and grammar rules automatically  ( Marcus 1993 )  . Substantial improvements have been made to parse western language such as English  , and many powerful models have been proposed ( Brill 1993 , Collins 1997) . However , very limited progress has been achieved in Chinese  . 
Knowledge acquisition is a bottleneck for real appication of Chinese parsing  . While some methods have been proposed to learn syntactic knowledge from annotated Chinese corpus  , most of the methods depended on the annotated or partial annotated data  ( Zhou 1997 , Streiter 2000) . 
Due to the limited availbility of Chinese annotated corpus  , tests of these methods are still small in scale . Although some institutions and universities currently are engaged in building Chinese tree bank  , no largescale annotated corpus has been published until now because the complexity in Chinese syntatic sturcture and the difficulty in corpus annotation  ( Chen 1996 )  . 
This paper proposes a novel method to facilitate the Chinese treebank construction  . 
Based on EnglishChinese bilingual corpora and better English parsing  , this method obtains Chinese bracketing information automatically via a bilingual model and word alignment results  . 
The main idea of the method is that we may acquire knowledge for a language lacking a rich collection of resources and tools from a second language that is full of them  . 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows : In the next section  , a bilingual language model is introduced . Then , a bilingual parsing method supervised by English parsing is proposed in section  2  . Based on the bilingual parsing , Chinese bracketing knowlege is extracted in section  3  . The evaluation and discussion are given in section  4  . We conclude with discussion of future work . 
1 A bilingual language model ? ITG
Wu ( 1997 ) has proposed a bilingual language model called Inversion Transduction Grammar  ( ITG )  , which can be used to parse bilingual sentence pairs simultaneously  . We will give a brief description here . For details please refer to ( Wu 1995, Wu 1997) . 
The Inversion Transduction Grammar is a bilingual contextfree grammar that generates two matched output languages  ( referred to as L1 and L2 )  . It also differs from standard contextfree grammars in that the ITG allows right hand side production in two directions : straight or inverted  . 
The following examples are two ITG productions :
C -> [ AB]
C -> < AB >
Each nonterminal symbol stands for a pair of matched strings  . For example , the nonterminal A stands for the string-pair ( A1 , A2) . A1 is a substring in L1 , and A2 is A1?s corresponding translation in L2 . Similarly , ( B1 , B2) denotes the string-pair generated by B . The operator [] performs the usual concatenation  , so that C -> [ AB ] yields the string-pair ( C1 , C2) , where C1 = A1 B1 and C2 = A2 B2 . On the other hand , the operator <> performs the straight concatenation for language  1 but the reversing concatenation for language 2  , so that C -> < AB > yields C1 = A1 B1 , but C2 = B2A2 . 
The inverted concatenation operator permits the extra flexibility needed to accommodate many kinds of word-order variation between source and target languages  ( Wu 1995 )  . 
There are also lexical productions of the following form in ITG : 
A -> x/y
This means that a symbol x in language L1 is translated by the symboly in language L2  . xory may be a null symbole , which means there may be no counterpart string on other side of the bitext  . 
ITG based parsing matches constituents for an input sentence-pair  . For example , Figure 1 shows an ITG parsing tree for an EnglishChinese sentence-pair  . The inverted production is indicated by a horizontal line in the parsing tree  . The English text is read in the usual depth-first left to right order  , but for the Chinese text , a horizontal line means the right subtree is traversed before the left  . The generated parsing results are : (1) [[[ Mr . Wu]BNP [[ plays basketball]VP[on
Sunday]PP]VP]S . ] S ( 2 ) [[[] [ []]]] We can also represent the common structure of the two sentences more clearly and compactly with the aid of <> notation  :   ( 3 ) [[< Mr . / Wu/>BNP < [ plays/ basketball /] VP [ on / e Sunday / ] PP > VP]S  . /] S where the horizontal line from Figure 1 corresponds to the <> level of bracketing .

Figure 1 Inversion transduction Grammar parsing Any ITG can be converted to a normal form  , where all productions are either lexical productions or binary-fanout nonterminal productions  ( Wu 1997 )  . If probability is associated with each production  , the ITG is called the Stochastic Inversion Transduction 
Grammar ( SITG).
2 English parsing supervised bilingual bracketing Because of the difficulty in finding a suitable bilingual syntactic grammar for Chinese and English  , a practical ITG is the generic Bracketing Inversion Transduction Grammar  ( BTG ) (Wu 1995 )  . BTG is a simplified ITG that has only one nonterminal and does not use any syntactic grammar  . A Statistical BTG ( SBTG ) grammar is as follows : j bibji baave A eu A vuAAAAAAA ejieij /  ; /  ;  /  ;  ] ; [?????????> <?????? SBTG employs only one nonterminal symbol A that can be used recursively  . Here , ? a ? denotes the probability of syntactic rules . 
However , since those constituent categories are not differentiated in BTG  , it has no practical effect here and can be set to an arbitrary constant  . 
The remaining productions are all lexical . bij is the translation probability that source word ui translates into target word vj  . bij can be obtained using a statistical word -translation model  ( Melamed 2000 ) or word alignment ( L?2001a )  . 
The last two productions denote that the word in one language has no counterpart on other side of the bitext  . A small constant can be chosen for the probabilities bie and be j  . 
In BTG , no language specific syntactic grammar is used . The maximum-likelihood parser selects the parse tree that best satisfies the combined lexical translation preferences  , as expressed by the bij probabilities . Because the expressiveness characteristics of ITG naturally constrain the space of possible matching in a highly appropriate fashion  , BTG achieves encouraging results for bilingual bracketing using a word-translation lexicon alone  ( Wu 1997 )  . 
Since no syntactic knowledge is used in
SBTG , output grammaticality cannot be guaranteed . In particular , if the corresponding constituents appear in the same order in both languages  , both straight and inverted , then lexical matching does not provide the discriminative leverage needed to identify the subconstituent boundaries  . For example , consider an
English Chinese sentence pair: ( 4 ) English : That old teacher is our adviser . 
Chinese : 
Using SBTG , the bilingual bracketing result is : ( 5 ) [[[[[[[ The/old/]teacher/] is /] our/ ] adviser /]  . / ]
The result is not consistent with the expected syntactic structure  . In this case , grammatical information about one or both of the languages can be very helpful  . For example , if we know the English parsing result shown in ( 6 )  , then the bilingual bracketing can be determined easily  ; the result should be (7) . 
(6 ) [[ That old teacher]BNP [ is [ our adviser]BNP] VP  . ] S ( 7 ) [[ That/old/teacher /] [ is /[ our/ adviser /]]  . /] From the example , we can see that if if one language parser is available  , the induced bilingual bracketing result would be more accurate  . English parsing methods have been well studied and many powerful models have been proposed  . It will be helpful to make use of English parsing results  . In the following , we will propose a method of bilingual bracketing supervised by English parsing  . 
Here , English parsing supervised BTG means using an English parser?s bracketing information as a boundary restriction in the BTG language model  . But this does not necessitate parsing Chinese completely according to the same parsing boundary of English  . If the English parsing structure is totally fixed  , it is possible that the structure is not linguistically valid for Chinese under the formalism of Inversion Transduction Grammar  . To illustrate this , see the example shown in Figure 2 .

Figure 2A example of mismatch subtree
VP eatless bread ( c )  The subtree for blacked underlined part of English and corresponding Chinese are shown in Figure  2  ( a )  . We can see that the Chinese constituents do not match the English counterparts in the English structure  . In this case , our solution is that : the whole English constituent of ? VP ? is aligned with the whole Chinese correspondence  ; i . e . , ? eat less bread ? is matched with ? ? shown in Figure  2  ( b )  . At the same time , we give the inner structure matching according to ITG regardless of the English parsing constraint  . An ? X ? tag is introduced to indicate that the sub-bilingual-parsing-tree is not consistent with the given English subtree  . Our result can also be understood as a flattened bilingual parsing tree as shown in Figure  2  ( c )  . 
This means that when the bilingual constituents couldn?t match in the small syntactic structure  , we will match them in a larger structure . 
The main idea is that the given English parser is only used as a boundary constraint for bilingual parsing  . When the constraint is incompatible with the bilingual model ITG  , we use ITG as the default result . This process enables parsing to go on regardless of some failures in matching  . 
We heuristically define a constraint function Fe ( s , t ) to denote the English boundary constraint , where s is the beginning position and t is the end  . 
There are three cases of structure matching : violate match  , exact match and inside match . 
Violate match means the bilingual parsing conflicts with the given English bracketing boundary  . For example , given the following English bracketing result (8) ,  (1 , 2) ,  (1 , 3) ,  (2 , 3) ,  (2 , 4) etc . are Violate matches . We assign a minimum F e(s , t ) (0 . 0001 at present ) to prevent the structure match from being chosen when an alternative match is available  . Exact match means the match falls exactly on the English parsing boundary  , and we assign a high F e(s , t ) value (10 at present ) to emphasize it . (1,6), (2, 5), (3, 5) are examples .  (3 , 4) ,  (4 , 5) are examples of inside match , and the value 1 is assigned to these
F e(s , t ) functions.

To insert English parsing constraints in bilingual parsing  , we integrate the constraint function F e(s , t ) into the local optimization function .

A minimal probability can be assigned to empty word alignment b  ( eet / ) and b ( vce / )  . 
The optimal bilingual parsing tree for a given sentence-pair can be computed using dynamic programming  ( DP ) algorithm ( Wu 1997 )  . 
Using the standard SBTG local optimization fuction  , the obtained bilingual parsing result for the given sentence-pair  ( 4 ) is shown as example ( 5 )  ; when using the above modified local optimization function  , the parsing result is that shown as example (7) . Comparing the two results , we can see that by intergrating English parsing constraints into BTG  , the bilingual parsing becomes more grammatical . Our experiments showed that this English parsing supervised BTG would improve the accuracy of bilingual bracketing by nearly  20%   ( L?2001b )  . 
The obtained bilingual parsing tree is in the normal form of ITG  , that is each node in the tree is either a lexical node or a binary-fanout nonterminal node  . We can combine the subtree to restore the fanout flexibility using the production characters [[ AA ]A ] = [ A[AA ]] = [ AAA ] and < < AA > A >= < A < AA > >= < AAA >  . The combining operation could not cross the given English parisng boundary  . 
3 Chinese bracketing knowledge extraction Table 1 shows some bilingual bracketing examples obtained using the above method  . To understand easily , we give the tree form of the first example in Figure  3  ( a )  . The leaf node is the aligned words of the two languages and their POS tag categories  . These POS tags are generated from an English and a Chinese POS tagger respectively  . The English POS tag and phrase tagset are the same as those of the Penn TreeBank  ( Marcus 1993 ) and the Chinse POS tagset please refer to the website : http://mtlab  . hit . edu . cn . The nonterminal node are labeled using English subtree tags  . 
Based on the bilingual parsing result , it is easy to extract the Chinese bracketing structure according to the Inversion Transduction Grammar  . For the normal node , the Chinese text is traversed in depth-first left to right order  , but for an inverted node ( indicated by a horizontal line in the parsing tree or indicated by a <> notation in bracketing expression  )  , the right subtree is traversed before the left . Thus , the Chinese parsing tree corresponding to Figure 3  ( a ) is shown in Figure 3 ( b )  . The nonterminal labels are derived from the English subtree  .

For example , in Table 2 , the English tags ? PP ( preposition phrase ) ? in sentence 1 and ? SBAR ( clause ) ? in sentence 4 are incorrectly tag the corresponding Chinese structure  . We don?t care about the phrase tags here . Our main concern is the bracketing boundary of the syntactic structure  . The bracketing boundary knowledge has been proved to be valuable for Chinese grammar induction  ( Zhou 1997 )  . The advantage of our method is that the bracketing knowledge is acquired from bilingual corpus automatically  . It reduces the manual labour for corpus tagging , which are time-consuming and error-prone . 
4 Evaluation and discussion
To evaluate the quality of the acquired Chinese bracketing boundaries  , we compared them with the parsing annotation based on an existed Chinese syntax annotation scheme  . Detail of the Chinese syntax annotation scheme and a annotated corpus can be download from the website http://mtlab  . hit . edu . cn . 
The test set consisted of 3,000
EnglishChinese bilingual sentence pairs that come from the machine translation evaluation corpus  ( Duan 1996 )  . The average length is 9 . 1 words for English sentences and 12 . 6 Chinese characters for Chinese sentences . The test sentence pairs were first aligned at the word level based on statistics and lexicon with a accuracy of nearly  90%  ( L?2001a )  . The English and Chinese sentences were parsed based on the Penn Treebank tagset and the Chinese syntax annotation scheme respectively  . Both the English and the Chinese parsing results were manually corrected  . 
The corrected Chinese parsing results are used as the standard test set  . 
We acquired Chinese bracketing results using the proposed method  . The previous defined exact match , violate match , and inside match are used to evaluate the accordance between acquired bracketing result and the standard parsing result  . Here , exact match means the acquired structure are the same as the standard structure  ; violate match means the acquired structure conflict with the standard structure  . 
Otherwise , the acquired structure is called a inside match . In example (9) , A is the standard bracketing result , B is the acquired bracketing result and C demonstrates the classification of the acquired structures  . The structure of whole sentence are not participate in evaluation  . Exact match rate ( EMR ) , violate match rate ( VMR ) , and inside match rate ( IMR ) denote the ratio of three types of bracketing numbers in all bracketing numbers respectively  .

From the results we can see that only a fraction of the learned structures are violate match  ( 14 . 03%), most of them are exact match (55 . 46%) . In addition , there are also many inside match . These inside matches occured due to the difference standard in phrase merging between Penn Treebank and the standard Chinese annotation scheme  . The English phrase structure are labeled with more details  . While for Chinese , the main phrase in the level of sentence are not merged futher  . For example , the verb and object in sentence level are not combined  . That is why most of the verb phrases ( VP ) are inside match ( 53 . 28%) . The bracketing boundary of inside match can be either right or wrong  . We checked the correctness of inside match manually and got a average accuray of  79  . 37% . Then the accuracy of all acquired structure bracketing is  79  . 68% ( EMR  IMR   Accuracy of IM) . 
The violate matches acquired in bilingual parsing are mainly due to the empty word alignments  . Such as in the special strucures ? F . . . ? and ? G . . . ? in Chinese . The word ? F ? and ? G ? has no counterpart word in English  . They are usually merged with the neighboring noun word as shown in example  ( 10 )  thus lead to a violate match . It is neccessary to build special patterns to handle these structures  . 
Word alignment errors also produce violate matches in bilingual bracketing  . 
(10 ) [[ F/pH/rI/ng][JK/vg[L/vg[/rMN/vg ]]] / wj ] The Chinese bracketing accuracy obtained using our method is comparable to that of the example-based Chinese parser  ( 77% )   ( Streiter 2000 )  , but it is lower than that of the PCFG Chinese parser  ( 84% ) (Yao1998 )  . However , unlike these two parser , our method needn?t any Table 3 Evaluation on acquired Chinese bracketing results Type Bracket number EMRIMR VMR Accuracy of IM Accuracy all  10119   55  . 46% 30 . 51% 14 . 03% 79 . 37% 79 . 68% BNP 253 371 . 69% 18 . 95% 9 . 36% 49 . 58% 81 . 09% NP 675 65 . 63% 20 . 30% 14 . 07% 70 . 80% 80 . 00% VP 1676 28 . 46% 53 . 28% 18 . 26% 92 . 72% 77 . 86% ADJP 1926 0 . 94% 26 . 04% 13 . 02% 86 . 00% 83 . 33% ADVP 120 45 . 83% 38 . 33% 15 . 83% 76 . 09% 74 . 99% PP 1198 52 . 92% 27 . 46% 19 . 62% 82 . 67% 75 . 62% Chinese annotated training corpus , which is difficult to accumulate . Another advantage of our method is that the Chinese bracketing result is derived based on English parsing and parallel corpus  , which make it particularly benefit for research on the corresponding relationship between Chinese and English phrase  . In ( L?2001b ) , we used bilingual bracketing result for automatic translation templates acquisition  , which turns out to be very useful for structure transfer in machine translation  . In addition , the acquired bracketing corpus can be applied to many Chinese NLP tasks  . It can be used as the foundation for further Chinese treebank annotation  , which will save human labour in a great deal . It can also be used to improve the efficiency and accuracy in Chinese grammar induction  ( Zhou 1997 )  . Grammar rules can also be extracted from the bracketing corpus  . For example , we can obtain the following BNP rules from the acquired bracketing results in Table  2: BNP->nx+nc ; BNP->r+ng ; BNP -> m+q ; BNP -> m+q+ng ; BNP->r+m+ng ; BNP->ny+us de+ng ; 
BNP -> nd+ng ; BNP -> a + us de+ng;

In this paper , we have presented a method to learn Chinese syntactic structure from English parsing based on a bilingual language model  . The method creates structure bracketing Chinese corpora automatically by taking full advantage of English parsing and bilingual corpora  . The created corpora are very useful for further
Chinese corpus annotation and parsing knowledge acquisition  . Primary experiment proved the feasibility and validity of the method  . 
Although this paper is related to Chinese and English  , the method is also applicable to other language pairs  . Obviously , if the concerned languages come from same language family  , such as English and French , the method would be more effective .
