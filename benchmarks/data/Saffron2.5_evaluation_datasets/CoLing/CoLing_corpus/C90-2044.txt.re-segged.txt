Abstract
Cue phrases are linguistic expression such as ' now ' and ' welg that may explicitly mark the structure of a discourse  . For example , while the cue phrase ' in-czd cntally ' may be used SENTENTIALLY as an adverbial  , the DISCOU aSE use initiates a digression . In \[8\] , we noted the ambiguity of cue phrases with respect to discourse and sentential usage and proposed an intonational model for their disambiguation  . In this paper , we extend our previous characterization of cue phrases a ald generalize its domain of coverage  , based on a larger and more comprehensive empirical study : an examination of all cue phrases produced by a single  , ~peaker in recorded natural speech . We also associate this prosodic model with orthographic and part-of-speech analyses of cue phrases in text  . Such a dual model provides both theoretical justification for current computational models of discourse and practical application to the generation of synthetic speech  . 
1 Introduction
Words and phrases that may directly mark the structure of a discourse have been termed CUE PttR  . ASES , CLUE WORDS , DISCOURSEM AI : tKERS ~ arid DISCOURSEPARTICLES \[3  ,  4 ,  14 ,  17 ,  19\] . Some exarn-pies are ' now ' , which marks the introduction of a new subtopic or return to a previous one  , ' incidentally ' and ' by the way ' , which indicate the beginning of a di-gression , and ' anyway ' and ' in any case ' , which indicate return from a digression . In a previou study\[8\] , we noted that such terms are potentially ambiguous between DISCOURSE and SENTENTIAL  uses\[18\]  . So , ' now'may be used as a temporal adverbial as well as a discourse marker  , ' incidentally ' may also function as an adverbial  , and other cue phrase similarly have one or more senses in addition to their function as markers of discourse structure  . Based upon an empiric M study of ' now ' in recorded speech  , we proposed that such discourse and sential uses of cue phrases can be disambiguated intonationally  . In particular , we proposed a prosodic model for this disambiguation which discriminated all discourse from * We thank Bengt Altenberg  , l = tichaa-dOman sonmid Janvan Santen for providing information and helpful comments on this work  . 
sentential uses of tokens in our sample . This model provided not only a plausibility argument for the disambiguation of cue phrases  , but also the beginnings of a model for the generation of cue phrases in synthetic speech  . 
In this paper , we show that our prosodic model generalizes to other cue phrases as well  . We further propose an initial model for the disambiguation of cuc phrases in text  . W c base these claims upon a further empirical study : an examination of all cue phrases produced by a single speaker in part of a recorded  , transcribed lecture . In Section 2 we review our own and other work on cue phrases , in Section 3 we describe our current empirical studies , in Section 4 we present he results of our analysis , and in Section 5 we discuss theoretical and practical applications of our findings  . 
2 Previous Studies
The important role that cue phrases play in understanding and generating discourse has been well documented in the computational linguistics literature  . 
For example , by indicating the presence of a structural boundary or a relationship between parts of a discourse  , cue phrases caa assist in the resolution of anaphora\[5  ,  4 ,   17\] and in the identification of rhetorical relations  \[10  ,  12 ,  17\] . Cue phrases have also been used to reduce the complexity of discourse processing and to increase textual  coherence\[3  ,  11 ,  21\] . 
In Example (1) 1 , interpretation of the anaphor'it'as ( correctly ) coindexed with THESYSTEM is facilitated by the presence of the cue phrases ' say ' and ' then '  , marking potential antecedents in ' . . . as an EXPERTDATABASE for ANEX PERTSYSTEM . . . ' as structurally unavailable . 2(1) " If THE SYSTEM attenqpts to hold rules , say as ANEX PERTDATABASE for ANEX PERTSYSTEM , then we expect it not only to hold the rules but to in fact apply them for us inappropriate situations  . "  1The examples are taken from the corpus described in Section  3  . 
2Inform Mly , ' say ' indicates the beginning of a discourse subtopic and ' then's ignals a return from that subtopic  . 

Previous attempts to define the set of cue phrases have typically been extensional  ,   3 with such lists of cue phrases then further classified as to their discourse function  . For example , Cohen \[3\] uses a taxonomy of connectives based on that of Quirk  \[16\] to associate with each class of cue phrases a semantic function with respect o a model of argument understanding  . Grosz and Sidner \[4\] classify cue phrases based on changes to the attentional stack and intentional structure found in their theory of discourse  . 
Schiffrin \[18\] classifies cue phrases into groups based on their sentential usage  ( e . g . conjunctive , adverbial , and clausal markers ) , while Reichman \[17\] and Ilobbs\[10\] associate groups of cue phrases with the rhetorical relationships they signal  . Finally , Zukerman \[21\] presents a taxonomy of cue phrases based on three functions relevant oher work in language generation : knowledge organization  , knowledge acquisition , and affect maintenance . 
Once a cue phrase has been identified , however , it is not always clear whether to interpret it as a discourse marker or  not\[6  ,  4 ,  8 ,  18\] . The texts in Exam-pie ( 2 ) are potentially ambiguous between a temporal reading of ' now ' and a discourse interpretation  :   ( 2 ) a . " Now in AI our approach is to look at a knowledge base as a set of symbolic items that represent something  . " b . " Now some of you may suspect from the title of this talk that this word is coming to you from Krypton or some other possible world  . " On the temporal reading , (2a ) , for example , would convey that ' at this moment the AI approach to knowledge bases has changed '  ; on the discourse reading , ' now'simply initiates the topic of ' the AI approach to knowledge bases '  . 
It has been suggested that this difference between discourse and sentiai use may be intonationally disambiguable  . Halliday and Hassan \ [6\] claim that , in general , items used COt IES1 VELY--i . e . , to relate one part of a text to another\[6, p . 4\]--tend to be intonationally non-prominent ( o be unaccented and reduced ) unless they are " definitely contrastive " . 
Non-cohesive uses , on the other hand , are indicated by non-reduced , accented forms . \[6, p .   268\] ttalliday and llass an particularly note that intonation disambiguates in this way between cohesive  ( discourse ) and noncohesive ( sentential ) uses of classes of items we term cue phrases , such as conjunctions and adverbials . Empirical studies to date have tended to bear out their observations  . Studies of portions of the London-Lund corpus such as  \[1\] have provided intonational profiles of word classes including DISCOURSEITEMS  , conjunctions and adverbials which are at least compatible with these views  . However , the notion of ' discourse item ' used appears much more restrictive  3An exception to this is found in the sociolinguistic work of  Schifl'rin\[18\]  . 
than the notion of ' cue phrase ' ,   4 so it is difficult to make comparative use of these results  . 
In an earlier study\[8\] , we examined the use of various intonational , syntactic , and orthographic features to distinguish between discourse and senten-t imreadings of a single cue phrase  ( ' now ' )  . 5 While feature such as tense , structural configuration , surface order , and orthographic indicators were sometimes useful  , we found that intonational features provided only only significant correlation with dis-course /sentential status  . All of the tokens in our sample were disarn biguable in terms of intonational phrasing and type of pitch accent fi In our study of now  , we found that discourse uses were either uttered as a single intermediate phrase  ( or in a phrase containing only cue phrases )   ( Discourse Type A )  , or uttered at the beginning of a longer intermediate phrase  ( or preceded only by other cue phrases in the phrase  ) and with a L*pitch accent or without a pitch accent  ( Discourse Type B )  . 
Cue phrases judged to be of Sentential Type were never uttered as a single phrase  ; if first in intermediate phrase they were nearly always uttered with a H * or complex pitch accent  ( Sentential Type A )  ; if not first in phrase they could be a rany type of pitch accent or be deaccented  ( Sentential Type B )  . These results are summarized in Figure I . 
Based on these findings , we proposed that listeners use prosodic information to disambiguate discourse from sentential uses of cue phrases  . To investigate this possibility further , we conducted another multispeaker study of discourse and sentential uses of the cue phrase ' welt  . Our findings were a lrnost identical to results for the earlier study  ; briefly , of the 52 in 4For example , in the 48 minute text Altenberg examines , he finds only 23 discourse items , or about 17% of what our study of a similar corpus ( described below ) would have predicted . 
Our corpus consisted of recordings of four days of tile radio call-in program " The Harry Gross Show : Speaking of Your Money  , " recorde during the week of 1February 1982115\] . The four shows provided approximately ten hours of conversation between expert  ( s ) m~d callers . 
6 For the earlier study as well as the current one , we assume Pierrehumbel ~ , ' s\[13\] system of phonological description . In this system , intonational contours are described as sequences of low  ( L ) and high ( H ) tones in the Fura DAM ~ NTA Lerrs . 
QUENCV ( F0)CONTOUrt . Pitch accents , peaks or valleys in the F0 contour that fall on the stressed syllables of lexical items  , signify intonational prominence . A pitch accent consists either of a singletone or an ordered pair of tones  , such as L*+H . The tone aligned with the stressed syllable is indicated by a star *  ; thus , in an L*+H accent , the low tone L * is aligned with the stressed syUahle  . There are six pitch accents in English : two simple tones -- H and L--and four complex ones -- L*+H  , L+H * , H*+L , and H+L* . A wellformed intermediate phrase consists of one or more pitch accents  , and a simplel figh Horlow Lt one that represents the phrase accent  . The phrase accent controls the pitch between the last pitch accent of the current intermediate pl wase and the beginning of the next--or the end of the utterance  . 
Intonational phrases are larger phonological milts  , composed of one of more intermediate phrases , plus a boundary tone which may also be HorL . The occurrence of phrase accents and boundary tones  , together with other phrase-froM characteristics such as passes a ald syllable lengthening  , enable us to identify intermediate madinton at ional phrases  .

To see whether these findings could be extended to cue phrases in general  , we began a third study--of all cue phrases produced by a single speaker during  75 minutes of recorded speech . The remainder of this paper describes our first results from this study  . 
3 The Data
To test whether our prosodic model of discourse and sentential uses of ' now ' and ' well ' extended to cue phrases in general  , we examined intonational chm'-acteristics of all single-word cue phrases  7 used in a keynote , address given by I~on ald Brachman at the First lnlernalional Conference on Expert Database Syslems in  1986  . The address provides approximately 75 minutes of speech t ? om a single speaker . 
For our first sample , we examined the 211 cue phrases uttered during the first 17 minutes of the address . Our tokens had the following distribution : s actually  ( 6 )  , also (2) , although (1) , and (68) , basically (1) , because (2) , but (12) , finally (1) , \] i , ' sl(1) , further (4) , however (2) , like (11) , look (11) , next (4) , now (26) , ok(1) , or (19) , say (12) , second (1) , see (5) , since (1) , so (9) , then (3) , therefore (1) , well (7) . 
To determine the classification of each token ( ms-COURSE , SENTENTIAL , or AMBIGUOUS ) , the authors separately . judged each token by listening to the taped address while marking a transcription  . 9r We exm nine do ~ fly single-word cue plu , a sea in tiffs study since our current prosodic model applies only to such items  . 
In future work we plan to develop additional models for discourse a ~ nL  ( laententiel uses of multl-word cue phrases , e . g ' that reminds me ' , ' firsto\]all ' , ' speaking off and so on . 
8Our set of cue phrases was derived from extensional def-init ions provided by ourselves and  othel~\[3  ,  4 ,  17 ,  18 ,  21\] . 
Tim following lexice litems , although also cue phrases , are not present in the portion of the axlch-ess examined to date : ' alright '  , ' alternatively ' , ' anyway ' , % oy ' , ~ conversely ' , ' exeepf , ' fine ' , '\] urthermore ' , ' incidentally ' , ' indeed ' , ' listen ' , ' moreover ' , ' nah ' , ' nevertheless ' , ' no ' , ' oh ' , ' right ' , ' why ' , ' yeah ' , ~ yes ' . 
9The address was transcr ibed independent ly of our s tudy by a meraber of the text processing pool at AT&T Bell Lab-oratories  . We found that 20 cite phrases had been omitted by the traalscriber : ' and '  , ' now ' , ' ok ' , ' so ' , and ' well ' . Significantly , ell but two of these were termed'discourse ' uses by In comparing our judgments  , we were interested in a reasof disagreement as well as agreement  . The set of tokens whose classification as to discourse or sentential use we agreed upon provide a test bed for our continuing investigation of the intonational disambiguation of cue phrases  . The set of tokens we found difficult to classify ( i . e . those tokens we both found ambiguous or those whose cla  . ssification we disagreed upon ) , provide insight into possible intonational correlates of discourse/sentential ambiguity  . " Fable 1 presents the distribution of our judgments , where ' classifiable ' represent those tokens whose classification we agreed upon and ' unclassifiable ' represents those we both found ambiguous or disagreed upon  . 
Table 1: Judgments by Type of Cue Phrase ,   N=211 I Type Unclassifiable All 78 Conj 57 Non-Conj 21 Classifial , lelaa 2LELH Of the 211 tokens in this initial sample , we found only 133 cue phrases (63 . 03%) to be unambiguously discourse or sential . When we looked more closely at the ' unclassifiable ' cases  , we found that fully 73 . 08% were coordinate conjunctions ( and , or , and but ) . In fact , when we compare percent classifi-able for conjunctions with other cue phrases  , we find that , while only 42 . 42% of conjunctions were found to be classifiable , fully 81 . 25% of non-conjunctions were classified . Thus , the case of coordinate conjunction appears to explain a large portion of the our difficulty in agreeing upon a classification  . 
Once we had made these judgments , we analyzed the tokens for their prosodic and syntactic features as wellms their orthographic context  , much as we haddone with tokens for the earlier two studies  . /? We noted whether each token was accented or not and  , if accented , we noted the type of accent employed . 
We also identified the composition of the intermedi-both judges  .

And we noted each token's position within its intermediate phrase -- first  ( including tokens preceded only by other cue phrases  ) or not . We also noted syntactic haracteristics of each item  , including part of speech and its immediately dominating constituent  , n Finally , we noted orthographic indicators in the transcript which might provide disambiguation  , such as immediately preceding and succeeding punctuation and paragraph boundaries  . In both the syntactic and orthographic analyses we were particularly interested in discovering how well non-prosodic features which might be obtained automatically from a text would do in differentiating discourse from sentential uses  . 
4 The Single-Speaker/Multi-
Cue Phrase Study
Our findings from the classified data ( 133 tokens ) in this pilot study confirmed our model of prosodic distinction between discourse and sentential uses of cue phrases  . The distribution of these judgments with respect othe prosodic model of discourse and sential cue phrases depicted in Figure  1 is shown in Table 2  . Recall that this model includes two intona-Table 2: Prosody of Classified Tokens , N = 133

Nownote in Table 2 that the ratio of discourse to sential usage was about  1:2  . Of the 44 tokens judged to represent discourse use and fitting our prosodic model  , one third were of Discourse Type A and two-thirds of Discourse Type B  . 
ll We used Hindie's parser Fidditch\[7\] to obtain constituent structure and Fiddit chaaid Church's part-of-speech  program\[2\] for part of speech assignment . 
While overall results are quite significant , the 17 items judged sentential which nonetheless fit the discourse prosodic model must be explained  . Of these 17 ,  14  ( representing two thirds of the total error ) are conjuncts ( 11' and ' s and 3'0 r's ) which fit the type ( b ) discourse prosodic model . While all are thus first in intermediate phrase- - and  , in fact , in intonational phrase--none are utterance -initial  . Both judges found such items relatively difficult to distinguish between discourse and sential use  . 12 In (3) , for example , while the first and seems clearly sentential , the second seems much more problematic . 
(3 ) "But instead actually we are bringing some thoughts on expert databases from a place that is even stranger and further away and that of course is the magical world of artificial intelligence  . " The difficulty in such cases appears confined to instances of sentential coordination where the conjunct is not utterance initial  . Table 3 shows how judgments were distributed with respect o our prosodic model when coordinate conjunctions are removed from the sample  . Our model thus predicts 93 . 4% of non-Table 3: Prosod . y of Classified Non-Conjuncts , N=91

Our prosodic model itself can of course be decomposed to examine the contributions of individual features to discourse/sentential judgments  . Table 4 shows the distribution of judgments by all possible feature complexes for all tokens  )   3 This distribution reveals that there is considerable agreement when cue phrases appear alone in their intermediate phrase  ( OF * , corresponding to Discourse type A in Figure 1) ; such items are most frequently judged to be discourse uses  . There is even more agreement when cue phrases appear in non-initial position in a larger intermediate phrase  ( NONF * -- Sentential type Binl ~ See Section 3 . Of the 99 conjuncts in thin study , both judges agreed on a discom~e/sentential distinction only  42  . 4% of the time , compared to 78 . 6 ~ agreement on non-conjtmcts .

Note that four cells ( ONFD , ONFH , ONFL , and ONFC ) are empty , since all items alone in their intermediate phrase must perforce come frrst in it  .

However , tokens which fit Discourse type B in Figure 1 ( first in a larger phrase and deaccented ( NOFD ) or with a L * ( NOFL ) ) appear more problematic : of the former , there was disagreement on fiflly two thirds )   4 While there is more agreement that tokens characterized as NOF It  ( first in a larger phrase with a H*accent ) or NOFC ( same with a complex pitch accent ) -- Sentential type A in Figure 1 --- are sentential , this agreement is certainly less striMng than in the case of tokens characterized a  , sNONF * ( non-initialil ~ a larger phrase with any type of pitch accent -- Sentential type B  )  . Since Discourse type B and Sen-tcntial type A differ only in ' type of pitch accent '  , we wight conclude that the pitch accent feature is not as powerfid a discriminator as the phrasal features ' alone in intermediate phrase ' or ' first in phrase '  . 
As in our previou study , we also examined potential non-prosodic distinctions between discourse and sential uses  . Of the orthographic and syntactic fi : atures we examined  , we found presence or absence of preceding punctuation and part-of-speech to be most successful in distinguishing discourse from sentential uses  . For the 113 tokens on which both judges agreed a . stodiscourse or sentential status , 1 ~ orthog-ral ) hy distinguishes between discourse and sential use in  101   ( 89 . 4%) of cases . Specifically ,   21 of 30 discourse uses are preceded by punctuation and only  3 of 83 sentential items . 
We also tbund that part-of-speech distinguishes discourse from sentential use  , although less successfully than orthography . If we simply predict discourse or se . ntential use by the assignment most frequently associated with a given part-of-speech  , both 14 And note that 91 . 3% of items in these two cellsm'e conjmlcts .

Church's part-of-speech algorithm and Hindle's Fidditch predict discourse or sential use in approximately  75% of cases where both judges agreed on discourse /sentential assigmnent  . For example , we assume that since the majority of conjunctions and verbs are judged sentential that these parts -of-speech are predictors of sential status  , and since most adverbials are associated with discourse uses  , these are predictors of discourse status , and so on . While part-of-speech thus might seem less useful than orthographic distinctions for our corpus  , the fact that it is not subject to transcriber idiosyncracy might make it a more reliable predictor than orthographic indicators in the general case  . Too , for text-to-speech applications , in which one would like to infer discourse or sentential use in order to employ the appropriate intonational features when synthesizing the item in question  , these textbased results are encouraging . 
5 Discussion
Our findings for the first stage of our single -speaker multi-cue phrase study support the intonational model of discourse/sentential characteristics of cue phrases which we proposed in  \[8\]  . Discourse uses of cue phrases fell into two groups : in one  , the cue phrase was set apart as a separate intermediate phrase  ( possibly with other cue phrases )  ; in the other , the cue phrase was first in its intermediate phrase  ( possibly preceded by other cue phrases ) and either was deaccented or bore a L * pitch accent  . 
Sentential uses were in general part of a larger intermediate phrase : if first in phrase  , they bore a H * or complex pitch accent . The association between discourse/sential models and discourse/sentential judgments is significant at the  . 0 (/1 level . We also found that the tokens we found difficult to  clas-255   5 sify were those in which disambiguation relied solely upon pitch accent  , rather than some combination of pitch accent and phrasing  . Furthermore , we found that orthographicues ( from transcription ) successfully disarn biguate between discourse and sentential usage in  89  . 4% of cases in our pilot study . Part-of-speech was less successful in distinguishing discourse from sentential use  , disambiguating only 75% of cases in the study . 
The disambiguating power of both our textual and our prosodic models has both theoretical and practical import  . From a practical point of view , the construction of both text based and prosodic models permit improvement in the generation of synthetic speech from unrestricted text  \[9\]  . With a prosodic model , we know how to convey discourse/sentential distinctions  ; with a textbased model , we know when to convey such distinctions . From a theoretical point of view , our findings demonstrate the feasibility of cue phrase disambiguation i both text and speech and provide a model for how that disambiguation might be done  . Furthermore , these results strengthen the claim that the discourse structures crucial to computational models of interaction can indeed be identified  .
