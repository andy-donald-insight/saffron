CUVOALDI ists all head words , head word variants and derivatives with simple codes denoting word classes and inflection patterns  , supplemented by verb pattern codes for verbs . Sense distinctions from OALD are not retained . 
Where ~ q the derivation of lexical informat ion as needed by the analysis from CUVOALD word class codes is relatively straight forward  , the OALD verb pattern codes , which are crucial for our purpose , present a real challenge . The dictionary classifies verbs according to the number and form of complements in % ~  51 " verb patterns " , marked by numbers 125 , supplemented in some cases by letters (4A , 4B , 4C , 4D , 4 F ) . The number of verbs in a single pattern is quite variable : starting from a single item in \[  VP4F \] for he followed by an infinitive up to 4855 standard transitive verbs in \[ VP6A  \] . A pattern groups together verbs which exhibit the same behaviour in a standard context and are subject to the same set of transfor ~ tions under specified conditions  . Soe . g . 
the class of intransitive verbs\[ VP2A \] can take introductory there and postpone the subject if it is indefinite and " heavy ": The recomes a time when we feel we must make a protest  . A single pattern is also used for verbs which allow the same motphe syntactic variations of a complement  .   ( \[ VPI \]: She's dark ~ in good health/here/a pretty girl  .  )
A different verb pattern is , however , used if only a subset of the relevant class perndLs the variation  . (\[ VP 6 C\]:Sheen ~ oyss wimmir ~ g /* to swim . vs . 
\[ VP6D\]:Shelikesswim~ting/toswim . ) Some vat ia t io~kq may be t reated as a d i f fe rent verb pat tern  .   ( This is the case of the above example : Sheli kesswimming  . \[ VP6D and Sitelikes to swim . \[ VPTA\])
Akkerman ( 1989 ) lists several shortcomings of the OALD verb patterns  . As Sampson (1990) noted , some of them are arguable . For our purpose , the most proble , ~ tic seems to be the treatment of compound verbs  ( with the resulting loss of in for . ~ tion in CUVOALD ) and too surface-level definition of some verb patterns  . These classes are quite a heterogenous collection : by\[  VPI4\] are marked verbs in all of the following uses , the only requirement being that the verb is followed by a noun and a prepositional phrase : They accused him of stealing the book  . 
I explained my difficulty to him.
Compare the copy with the original.
Another " misbehaved " pattern is VP4A where , depending on the verb , the infinitive can be complement or adjunct : The ~ winm~er failed to reach the shore  . 
liecame to see that he was mistaken.
Shestood up to see better.
Apart from these " systemic " blemishes we expect a number of other inconsistencies and errors to appear during t ~ process of der ivation and use of the target lexicon  .

The complementation paradigm , ratmrt I~n being stated within fullfledged feature structures  , is expressed in terms of templates , preferrab \] y allowing defaults and mul tiple inheritance  , Accordingly , the above two paradig ~ wil\]be expressed as follows : ACRESDE  COLING-92  .

Two verbal entries can he related by a lexical rule with the effect that one of these two entries need not be explicitly present  ( the ot~er should then be ~ rked by the rule's name  )  . 
This will solve phenomena such as there preposir ~ , dative alternation , and passivization . 
The collection of three " levels " of description within a single complementation paradigm provides a means to express rather subtle differences  . Let us take as an example four superficially identical constructions :  ( a ) Iw ~ nted him to see the monster . 
(b ) I expected him to see the monster.
(c ) I elected him to see the monster.
( d ) I told him to see the monster.
Following Quirk et al (1985, p . 1216) , the verb is monotransitive in ( a ) , complex-transitive in ( b ) and ( c ) , and ditransitive in(d ) . The example ( b ) is closer to the monotransitive type while ( c ) is closer to the ditransitive type . 
If we have the subcategorization list
SC <\[1\]N\[nom\]4 , \[2\]N\[acc\]5 , \[3\]V\[inf ,   SC<Ns>\]6 > to express the superficial identity of all the four cases  , we can assume the above verbs to have the following syntactic frames :  ( a ) SF\[SUBJ\[I\] , OBJ\[3\]\](b ) SF\[SUBJ\[I\] , OBJI2\] , OBJ COMPL\[3\]\](c ) SF\[SUBJ\[1\] , OBJ\[2\] , OBJ COMPL\[3\]\](d)SF\[SUBJ\[I\] , OBJ\[3\] , OBJ212\]\]
The difference between the types ( a ) and ( b ) vs .   ( c ) and ( d ) is that between the Raising and Equitypes . 
Therefore ,   ( b ) will have only two participants at the level of under-lying structure while  ( c ) will have three: ( a ) US\[ACr 14\] , PAT\[6\]\](b)US\[ACT\[4\] , PAT\[6\]\](c)US\[ACT\[4\] , PAT\[5\] , EFF\[6\]\](d)US\[ACT\[4\] , PAT\[6\] , ADDR\[5\]\]
The respective templates will be: ( a ) transitive , 3 inf , raising ( b ) complex-transitive , 3 inf , rais in ~( c ) complex-transitive , 3 inf , equi(dditrensitive , 3 inf , equi
A problem remains bow to derive such information from OAL/Ts verb patterns  . 
5. THEDEIVATION
CUVO ALD was not pri . ~ rily intended for use with a syntactic parser , so a few modifications were necessary . 
First , the pronunciation field was deleted and homograph entries with different pronunciations r~erged  . ( In
CUVOALD , each word , or wordform , has only one entry , unless it has two different pronunciations . ) Second , entries headed by regular forms within irregu lar paradigms as head words were also dele ted  . And finally , reference to baseforms was provided in entr ies of all the remaining nonbase  ( irregu-lar ) forms . Baseforms of irregular paradigms were marked by a codespeci-fying the paradigm type  . After that , we tried to find a way how to derive the complementation paradigms  . 
Ideally , templates of the sort described in Section 4 should Corres-pond to OALD verb patterns wh ile lexi-cal rules would account for st ructures listed in Horn by  ( 1975 ) as variants of the same verb pattern . Although this idea works in t ~ e case of the most frequent patterns  ( \[ VP2A\] , \[ VP6A\]) , there are many patterns where the relation between pattern and paradigm can bel:n  , n : l , or even n : n(n > I ) ( see Section 3) . 
The case of n patterns : i paradigm reduces the number of paradigms and as such is a welcome situation  . The case of 1:n can mean ( i ) ambiguity for all verbs listed under the pattern  ( and c~n possibly be accounted for by lexi- cal rules  )   ,   ( ii ) the possibility to subdivide the verbs of this class into n subclasses  , or ( iii ) a combination of the two . For ( il , the derivation of complementation paradi ~ l from a verb pattern will yield a dis junction  . For ( ii ) , verbs with different complemen-ration paradigms should be distin-ACRESDE  COLING-92  , NANTES , 2328 AO't3"r1992556 PROC . OFCOLING-92, NANTES , AUG . 2328, 1992 guished . Boguraev and Briscoe (1 . 989 ) used valency codes in Ii ) 0 CE ( Lon~gnan Dictior ~ ary of Contemporary English ) to autematical \] y extract the ( explicitly unmarked ) distinction between Equi and Raising verbs . Similar approach can betNed to , ~kethis and other distinctions in OALD by taking into account cooccurences of verb patterra  . ( Amsituation is simplerira that we , ~syet , make no attempt to treat distinct . 
word senses , and more difficult intidal the blurred se ~ e distinctions can have negative effect on any deriv-ation procedure  .

However , at the same time we have fx ) supplyn ~ reinforn ~ tiont ~ some classes of verbs  , for which any pessibilJty of autonmt ~ c treatment isex\[uded  . The current efforts include the specification of lexica \] values of particles and prepositions for compound verbs and assigning verbs n~rked by verb pattern codes such m ~  VP14 to relevant subclasses . 
The correspondences between the
OALD patterns and complementation paradigms are stated in the simple cases by rules relating one or more patterns to one or more paradigms - templates  . Where possible , frequently cooccurring verb patterns are collapsed into a single paradigm with local disjuction  , e . g . \[ VP 61 ) \] and\[VPTA \] for like ( swimming/to swim ) give the following template : \[ transitive , 2 ing/2 inf , equi\] , which expands into:
SC <\[ I\]N\[nomb , \[21 V\[pres part linf , SC < N3 >\] 4> , 
SF\[suBJ\[11, OBJlZl\],
US\[GOV like , ACI'\[3\], PAT\[4\]\]
Now t~re are two possible strategies representing two extremes  . The first strategy disregards the actua l distribution of verb patterns in the d ictionary and atten~ts to combine result so frule application into a compact and meaningful complementa- 
Lion paradigm . The second strategy starts from a list of all combinations of verb patterns within the dictionary and assigns a rule to every combination  . Let us lookmw the first approach works . 
The process of derivation of a com-plement at ion paradigm for a verb entry consists of the following steps :  1  . Application of rules rewriting a verb pattern code  ( or more verb pattern codes if the resulting paradigms can be related by a lexical rule  ) by a template or a sequence of templates collected by logical operators " and " and " or  "  , the result may be marked by one or mere lexical rule names  . Rules rewriting n~rel~tter ~ are preferred to those rewriting fewer i ~ t terns  . 
A rule may be , supplemented by a condi-tion stipulating the presence or absence of ' other paradigi ~ within the same entry  . A rule whose condition is satisfied is pre ferred to a rule wJ th out condition  . Verbs with patter ~ which do not , corresl ~ nd to a single complementation i ~ radigm while cooccurring verb patterns do not indicate a preference i brone paradigm or the other have to be treated  , ~ nu ~ lly . 
2 . Simplification of templates by making as local as possible  . 
the sequence of all disjunctions 3 . Consistency check performed by expansion of the sequence of templates into feature structures  .

b ) This is the template of a prepositional verb . The lexical value of the preposition should be supplied  . 
This looks like a principled solution , but step i can be a source of unfore seen complexities with the result that too  , ~ nyentries will have to he handled manually . The second strategy is much safer : if there are not too many different combinations of verb patterns it might not be too difficult to state rewriting rules for all of them  , thuse\]iminati , ~ steps 2 and 3 from the above procedure . 
However , to make a decision , some statistical analysis is necessary . 
CUVOALD lists 5695 verbs with 633 different combinatioi ~ of verb patterns . ~4853 verbs (85 . 2% ) are marked by one of the 56 most frequent combinations ( each occurring seven and more times )   . The first ten most frequent combinations are given below : verb patterns frequency  6A   1971   2A  , 6 A 5752 A3386 A , 143312 A , 2C 1652 A , 3 A 1376 A , 15B 1012 A , 2C , 6AI002 A , 2C , 6A , 15B 813 A 64
At the other end , t ~ reare 442 combinations occurring only once , 191 two and more times ,   119 three and more times and 77 five and mere times . 
Another survey was aimed at finding most frequent combinations as proper subsets of the full combinations treated above  . E . g . the combination of three patterns 2A , 3A , 6 A occurs alone in 54 entries , but as a proper subset of a larger combination already in  566 entries . 
From the above data it seems that a compromise between the treatment of individual verb pat terns and of entire combinations would be most efficient  . 
1 19 combinatio ~ can already be treated by individual rules quite comfortably while the rest can be composed from results of rules applied independently  , where more alert supervision is required . It also seems feasible to use the rules for combinations to treat parts of the remaining lists of verb patterns  , ar~perhaps add a few more , se #ected according to the second statisti cs  . 
6. P~SPM\[rr\]A ~
Lexicon and gram , ~r together form the basis for the extraction of lexical and structural correspondences  . 
Other tools are necessary , however , and we are currently designing specifications for such tools  . 
Besides the nontrivial task of text cleanup , for which no special tools will be used , two major needs remain : text unit align , ~ nt and data extraction methods . 
Automatic text unit alignment ( on word , phrase , and sentence level ) is also non-trivia / . On the sentence level , we will employ a method for a ligpmlent based on sentence length  ( Gale 1991 )  , for which we have developed af \] exible frontend for recognizing sentence houndaries  . We are considering an extension of Church's algorithm taking into account lexicon-based elementary word corres-pendences  ( as in Kay ( 1988 ) and Cati-zone et al ( 1991 )   ) for better accuracy , but this extension has not been implemented yet . 
Methods for data extraction are still under development  . However , it is clear what such data should look like . As our output representation is AcrEs DE COLING-92  , NANTES , 2328 AOt ) r1992558 PROC , OFCOLING-92 , NANTES , AUo .  2 . 3-28 , 1992 far from the inter\]Jr ~ u ~ ideal , the data will basically be transfer data in a form fitti ~ the structural trans fer model  , following the ideas of
