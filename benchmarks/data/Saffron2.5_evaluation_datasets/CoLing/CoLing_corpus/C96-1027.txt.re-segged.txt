0 Introduction
In the context of the emerging research area o\[' computational semantics  , topics related to the syntax-semantics interfime have deserved special attention  . One such topic is the SUBCAT fbature and the in Ibrmation encoded in it  . 
In IIPS(\] framework , this I batuce has been shown to be a critical point of articulation t  ) etween highly autonon musprinciple-based syntax and semantic scmnponents  ( vd . a . () . Frank and l (', yl (; 1995) .

On the other hand , by means of ' the linear order hierarchy assigned to these elements  , syntactic generalizations concerned with word order  , binding , alternations , etc . are also regist , ered ( I ) ollard and Sag 1987 , Ch .  5) . 
Recent research , namely by lida , Manning ,   ( )' Nell and Sag ( 1994 ) and Sag and ( iodard ( 1994 )  , broughtt ; <) light evidence that , contrary Low hat was originally assumed in ( l ' ollard and Sag 1987 ;  1994) , those di\['ferent syntactic generalizations may not be encoded by one and the same ordering of the subcategorized elements  . This issue was directly addressed by Manning and Sag  ( 1995 )  , who proposed to recast the SUBCAT intbrmation into two diffi  ; rent lists . 
( ) ne of the lists displays the subcategorized e lements according to an order relevant to their l in earsurl ~ t ce concatenation  . This " valence " list results from the append of S\[BJ  , SPEC and ( X)MI ) Slists , which are but the result of a previous segment at ion of the SUB  ( ' , A Tlist proposed by Borsley ( 1987 ) and taken uI ) by Pollard and Sag (  1994 , (' J  ~ .  9) . 
The other list , in Lurn , orders the subcategorized element succm'ding to a hierarchy relew mtU  ) se\[up the binding relations between them . This " argument " list is the value o\[' the new ARG-Sf bature  .

1 Empirical Motivation for Split
Obliqueness
The main arguments presented by Manninv and Sag ( 1995 ) for splitting obliqueness into valence obliquene  . ss and binding obliqueness rest on the analysis of two linguistic phenmnena : reflexives in Toba Batak  , a western aus Lrenesian language , and . 
reflexives in Japanese causative constructions.
1.1 Toba Batakreflexives
The pair < ) t'senLences in ( 1 ) illustrate stile distinction between the objective voice  , in(l ) a . , unmarked contexts , and its active voice counterpart , in (1) b . , expressed by the mang-prefix ( Manning and Sag 1995 ,  (16)) .

nv-see PMRia PMT or us ' To rus sees/saw Ria . ' In Toba Batak there is strong evidence that , intransitive constructions , a verb and the following NP form a VP constituent regardless of the voice chosen  . Therefore , the constituent structure of (1) a . and b . is presented in (2) a . and b . , together with the corresponding lexical entry of the verb  ( Manning and Sag 1995 ,  (21) ,  (20)) .

Now , the examples in ( 3 ) show all the possible occurrences of one reflexive NP in the basic transitive structures illustrated in  ( 1 )  . In (3) a . and a ' . , the reflexive occurs in objective constructions , respectively , as an immediate constituent of VP and as an immediate constituent of S  . The corresponding active constructions are displayed in  ( 3 ) b . and b' . ( Manning and Sag 1995, (22), (23)) .

The pair of grammatical constructions (3) a'./(3) b.
confirms that binding principles cannot be defined in terms of linear word order or c-command  . In (3) a ' . the antecedent precedes the reflexive , but in (3) b . it is the reflexive that precedes the antecedent ; in (3) b . the antecedent c-command the reflexive , but in (3) a ' . it is the other way around . 
However , contrary to the assumptions of the Binding Theory of Pollard and Sag  ( 1994 )  , also the the SUBCAT valence order . This is made evident by (3) a . and (3) a ' . , whose grammatical status is not correctly predicted  . In (3) a . , the reflexive is bound by a less oblique element in the SUBCAT list  , in accordance with Principle A , but the construction is not acceptable . In (3) b . , the reflexive is bound by a more oblique element in the SUBCAT list  , in violation of Principle A , but the construction is acceptable . 
The solution adopted by Manning and Sag ( 1995 ) consists of a three step move : i ) to keep the Binding Theory unchanged ; ii ) to create a new list of subcategorized elements , which is named ARG-S ( from argument structure ) ; iii ) to define o-command relations on the basis of the obliqueness hierarchy established on this new list  , which may be different from the obliqueness hierarchy established in the 
SUBCAT list.
Let us then see how this solution works for the problematic examples in  ( 3 )  . In ( 4 ) we find the lexical entries of ( 3 ) after their reshut~ing according to Manning and Sag's proposal  ( for the sake of readability , the representation of SUBJ and
COMPS features is omitted).

It is easy to check that the correct predictions are made if the relevant o-command relations are established on the ARG-Slist : the reflexive is now coindexed with a more oblique element in  ( 3 ) a . /(4) a . , and with a less oblique antecedent in (3) a ' . /(4)a' . 
1 . 2 Ref lex ives in Japanese causat ives The other linguistic evidence put forward to support this obliquenes split is the behavior of reflexives in Japanese causative constructions  , as originally argued for by I id a , Manning , O'Neil and
Sag (1994).
The analysis of case marking , agreement and word order phenomena in Japanese causatives reveals that this construction exhibits properties of a single clause sentence  . 
As to the Japanese reflexive zibun , like English reflexives , it must be locally o-bound , with some particulars , as for instance its being subject-oriented , that is it can be bound only by a subject . 
Now , the example of (5) illustrates that , in the context of causatives , zibun is not restricted to being bound by the subject of its clause  ( Manning and Sag 1994 ,  (44)) .

Contrary to the requirements of Principle B , in such contexts pronouns may be bound by an antecedent occurring in the same clause  , but only if it is the subject of the causative construction  . This is illustrated in (6) ( Iida et al 1994 ,  (17)) .

' The solution proposed in ( lida et al 1994 ) for accounting for the apparent peculiar properties of binding constraints in causatives relies on the assumption that he derived lexical representation of a causative verb  , like tazune-sase (' mades b . 
visit') , has the form sketched in (7) , where tazune is the verb ' to visit ' and-sase the causative suffix  ( lida et al 1994 ,  (25)) .

Consequently , this solution relies also on the three basic assumptions adopted fbr the analysis of Toba Batakreflexives : i  ) the principles of Binding Theory remain invariant  ; ii ) a new list of subcategorized elements , termed ARG-S , is adopted ; iii ) o-command relations are defined on the basis of the obliqueness hierarchy established in this new list  . Moreover , there is a fourth assumption which proposes that Principles A and B should be validated in at least one of the two ARG-S features occurring in the derived lexical entry of a causative verbal brm  . 
Looking at the lexical representation fcausative verbs in  ( 7 ) and the examples ( 5 ) and ( 6 )  , it is easy to check that Principle A is satisfied in the lower ARG-Slist for the binding Ziroo /himself  , where Ziroo is the subject , and in the upper ARG-S for the binding Taroo /himself  , where Taroo is now the subject . As to the contrast in (6) , Principle B is satisfied in the lower ARG-Slist , where the pronoun is locally o-tYee . 
2 Empirical Motivation for
Branching Obliqueness
Once the binding obliquenessiun packed from the valence list and gets an autonomous status  , it becomes easier to increase the empirical adequacy of Binding Theory  , in particular , and the syntax-semantics accuracy , in general . In this section I argue this can be done by letting the ARG-Svalue have a nonlinear ordering  . 
2.1 Subject-oriented reflexives
There are languages in which the reflexives , though they must be locally-bound , can be bound only by a subject . Examples of such languages are Malayalam and Hindi  , I Yom India , Langoti'om Uganda , Bahasafi " om Indonesia , Japanese , Korean and Russian ( vd . ( Pahner 1994, p . 100 if ) and ( Manning and Sag 1995)) . Example (8) is takenf Yom Lango ( Pahner 1994, p .  \] 01) .

Okeloasked Alaba about self'Okeloi asked Alabaj about himselfi/*j  . ' The solution put forward in ( Manning and Sag 1995 ,   ( 6 ) ) to account br this particular sort of reflexives is t of brmulate a new binding principle  , the A-Subject Principle , where a na-subject is defined as the " entity that is first in some ARG-Slist ":  ( 9 ) A-Subject Principle
Anaphors must be a-subject-bound ( in some languages )  . 
Deciding whether the Binding Theory should include Principle A or A-Subject Principle depends thus on the language which it is being applied to  . 
The alternative solution I propose does not involve different formulations for binding principles or additional principles  . In this solution , the Binding Theory is kept invariant . One simply has to state that , for those languages , like Lango , that have subject-oriented reflexives , the binding obliqueness hierarchy is not as sketched in  ( 10 ) a . , but as in (10) b . . In other words , languages may vary with regards to the configuration given to the 
ARG-Svalue.

As illustrated in (11) , ziji may be bound by an antecedent from outside or inside its which is not a subject  ( Xue et al 1994 ,  (2)) .

The authors elucidated its particulars , namely that zUi is inherently animate , and ambiguous between a discourse pronoun and a ( syntactic ) z-pronoun . As at z-pronouni to beys Principle Z ( Xue at al . 1994, (38)): (12) Princi ~

Nevertheless , the authors of l bre ( tno solution t brac counting t br the thct that syntactic ziji is subject-oriented  . That solution t bllows now naturally and i in mediately from the assumption that the elements of each ARG-Svalue receive the non linear order of  ( 10 ) b . . Principle Z alone is thus now enough to make the correct predictions about ziji as soon as theo -command relations arc established over the binding obliqueness hierarchy of multi-clausal sentences displayed in  ( 1 ; ) , typical of languages with subject-oriented reflexives  .

Any node in the hierarchy is preceded only by subjects because in each  ( clausal ) AR ( \]- S value only subjects can be less oblique than any other argument  . 
2 . 3 Ref lex ives in Russ ian pass ives Binding Theory predicts that binding " constraints on subcategorized lements may change by virtue of ' the application of lexical rules  . The correctness of this prediction is cont\]rmed , for instance , by English passives ( Pollard and Sag 1994 , (\] h .  6, (111)) . In (14) a . , John cannot bind himself . 
I ~ ut after tim reordering of subcategorized lements by the passive rule  , John can now bind himself , as shown in (14) b . . The contrast of ( 14 ) is correctly accounted t'or because John is less oblique than himself in  ( 14 ) b . , but it is more oblique in (14) a . .

Incennection with this possibility for lexical rules to change obliqueness relations  , it would be interesting to lind cases where lexical rules change o-command relations in a way that the result requires a branching configuration  . This would be an interesting empirical confirmation of the need ibr nonlinear obliqueness  . 
One such case can be fbund in the context of Russian passives  . Russian sebe is a subject-oriented refle , xive . In active constructions it may he bound only by the subject  . Nevertheless , in the context of a passive sentence , , like (15) , sebe can also be bound by the by-phrase ( Manning and Sag 1994 ,  (9)) .

INSTR tbrself ' This book was bought by Boris / br  himself5' The subject-oriented behavior of sebein active sentences results  , like in other languages with subject-oriented reflexives  , from the nonlinear ordering of the elements of ARG-Svalue  , with all arg i ( 2_<_i_<n ) being preceded by art 1 . As to passives in Russian , the lexical rule , among other things , must give a new ordering to the ARG-Sw due where all ar~i  ( 3_<i_<n ) are preceded only by a rgl and art 2 . 
(1 . 6) Passive Rule ( partial def . )\[Am~-s(\[~,~J,\[~, . . . ,  \[2101 complements Another problematic case for the current Binding Theory comes from Portuguese as it fails to make the correct predictions for binding patterns involving reflexives in the context of verbs with two oblique complements  . One such verb is falar_com_acerca ( ' talk to about ' ) :  ( 17 ) a . A Mariafaloucomo Pedroacer cadonovo Director .

Given the linear order for the ARG-Svalue the current theory assumes  , it is predicted that if a reflexive occurring as the oblique complement Y is grammatically bound by an antecedent occurring as the oblique complement X  , then X is less oblique than Y . Moreover , it is also predicted that the reversed binding configuration  , where the reflexive would occur as the oblique complement X  , will be ungrammatical . These predictions are sketched in the following contrast schemata  , where siprSprio is a reflexive ruled by Principle A:  ( 18 ) a . A Mariafalou\[PREP-XoPedroi\]o BL . x\[PREP-Ysipr6priOi \] o BL_Y . 
b . * A Mariafalou\[PREP-Xsip . rSprioi\]OBL_x\[PREP-YoPedroi\]OBL_Y The failure of these predictions is illustrated in  ( 19 )  , which presents the instanciation of schemata (18) . In (19) a . / a ' . , PREP-X is made equal to corn ( ' to ' ) and PREP-Y to a cercade ( ' about ' )  ; in (19) b . / b ' . it is the opposite . The pairs a . / a ', and b . / b ' , simply exhibits different surfhce orders of the oblique complements in the sentence  , a grammatical possibility illustrated in (17) a . / a ' . . In all examples the binding of the reflexive is ungrammatical  1  .

This is another puzzle for the current Binding Theory which receives a neat solution with a branching hierarchy for the ARG-Svalue  . In particular , the data presented in ( 19 ) receive an adequate account if the ARG ~ S feature of verbs like falar_com_acerca is as follows  , where the two PP complements do not precede each other and a reflexive occurring in one of them cannot be bound by an expression occurring in the other :  ( 20 ) a . 
\[ ARG-S(NP , PP\[com\]:n pro , PP\[acercade\]:ana\]b . 
\[ ARG-S(NP , PP\[com\]:ana , PP\[acercade\]:n pro ) \]  3 Non-linear O-command All the solutions proposed for the above binding puzzles are similar in the sense that they rest upon the same two very simple assumptions  . First , the Binding Theory remains unaltered , as defined by Pollard and Sag (1994 , Ch . 6) with the subsequent specifications , put forward by Iida , Pollard and Sag (1994) and Manning and Sag (1995) , that the binding principles must be validated on at least one of the relevant ARG-S features  . Second , the elements of ARG-Svalue may have a nonlinear order  . 
Giving some attention to the first of these two assumptions  , it is worth noting that not only the binding principles remained unchanged  , but also the formal notions used in its make up , ( e . g . the relations of o-command and o-binding ) were kept unaltered . This worked fine in the examples tackled above , but it is expected that a notion like o-command , ultimately defined on the basis of the precedence relation  , may need some further specification . This is so because , given the second assumption that non-linear ordering ~  ; are acceptable , new cases must be taken into account , preced each other in the hierarchy . 
Consider the definition of o-command t br linear obliqueness  ( simplified version , ( Xue et al 1994 ,   ( 35 ) ):  ( 21 )   ( Linear ) O-command XO-COMM AND SY iff X is a less oblique coargmnent of Z that dominates Y  . 
\[ ncase Z = Y , X is said to LOCAI , LYo-comm and Y.
where X is less oblique than Y iff X precedes Y in an ARG-Slis L This definition was shown to be adequate for the data considered so thr  . Notice , however , that in the examples above we were mainly concerned with the validation of Principle A  . Consequently , in those examples one was checking only whether a given X preceded a certain Y  . For this kind of cases , having a linear or a branching obliqueness makes no difference t br the definition of o -command as such  . 
Now , when it is Principle B that must be val idated  , it must be checked whether a given element X does not locally o-cemm and another element Y  . : If X and Y are not in the same ARG-Slist , they do not locally o-command each other , irrespective of the option t bralinear or a non-linear obliqueness  . However , if ' they are in the same list , assuming a linear or a branching obliqueness hierarchy makes a difference  . 
In a linear order , two cases occur : either X precedes Y or Y precedes X  . ' l ' heretbre , X does not o-comm and Y iff Y precedes X . ( i . e . Y is more oblique than X ) . In a branching order , however , a third case also occurs : X is as oblique as Y ( they do not precede each other )  . Therefore , we would like to have an empirical basis to ascertain whether X does not o-comm and Y in this case  . 
Suitable empirical evidence fbr settling this issue comes from the counterparts of the Portuguese examples in  ( 19 )  , where the rellexive is replaced by tl he pronoun ele  , ruled by Principle B .   ( 22 ) presents examples where the pronoun and its antecedent occur in the same ARG-Slist and they are equally oblique  . 
(22) a . * A Mariafalou corno Pedro/acerca delei . 
Maria talked to Pedro/a houthim/a' . * A Mariat'aloua deleic or no Pe . droi . 
Maria talked about him/to Pedro/b . * A Marial hlouce meleia cercado Pedro/ . 
Maria talked to him/a houtl'edroib ' . * A Mariathloua cercadol ~ edroi cornelei . 
Maria talked about Pedro/to him /
The ungrammatically of these examples shows that the pronoun is not locally o-free there and  , consequently , it is not the case that the local antecedent does noto-command it  . 
The data fi-om ( 19 ) and ( 22 ) present thus the empirical basis for a proper definition of o-command in non-l in earobliqueness hierarchies  . 
(19) shows that , when X and Y are equally oblique , it is not the case that Xo-commands Y .  (22) , in turn , shows that , under the same circumstances , it is also not the case that X does no to-command Y  . 
Consequently , the definition of the o-command relation must be adequately specified fbr branching obliqueness hierarchies as t bllows  ( italics indicates the specification added to ( 21 ) ) 2  . 
(23 ) \[Nonlinear ~ O-command ? X ( )- COMMANDS Y iff X is a less oblique coargument of Z that dominates Y  ; 
XLOCAL LYo-commands Y if Z = Y .
? X DOESNOTO-COMMANDY iff X is not a less obl ique co argument of Z that dominates Y and is not as oblique as Y  ; 
X does not I , OCALI , Yo-commands Y if

Conclusions
It is was shown that the accuracy of the syntax -semantics interface in HPSG grammars  , in general , and the empirical adequacy of Binding Theory , in particular , are improved by allowing the ohliqueness h ierarchy to have a branching configuration  . 
Data involving subject-oriented rellexives , both in active and passive constructions , subject-oriented reflexive pronouns , and reflexives in double oblique constructions presented difficult  , apparently unrelated , puzz lest br the current Binding Theory which received a neat and unified solution under the present account  .
