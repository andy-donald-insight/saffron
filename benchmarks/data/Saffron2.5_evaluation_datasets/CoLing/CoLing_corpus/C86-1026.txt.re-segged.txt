This paper looks at the use in machine Translat ion systems of the linguistic models of Case and Valency  . 
It is argued that neither of these models was or iginally developed with this use in mind  , and both must be adapted somewhat to meet this purpose  . In particular , the traditional Valency distinction of complements and adjuncts leads to conflicts when valency frames in different languages are compared : a finer but more flexible distinct ion is required  . 
Also , these concepts must be extended beyond the verb , to include the noun and adjective as valency bearers  . As far as Case is concerned , too narrow an approach has traditionally been taken : work in this field has been too conerned only with cases for arguments in verb frames  ; case label systems for non-valency bound elements and also for elements Jnnominal groups must be elaborated  . The paper suggests an integrated approach spec if ically oriented towards the particular problems found in MT  . 
\]. Introduction
Most ( though not all ) MT systems claim to incorporate versions of Valency grammar  , and more recently have also looked to Case grammar  . However , whatever theory they use is often imported more or less directly  , without taking account of the fact that a model developed for one purpose may not be entirely appropriate for another  . This is a less serious problem for Valency , though this was originally designed with a monolingual didactic purpose in mind  ( see Helbig & Schenkel ,  1973:5 ) rather than the multiling ~ alneeds of translation  . With Case however , it is often the much-maligned and quickly supereeded Fillmore  ( 1968 ) model which is adopted , or at best a ' consensus ' model like that of Fi ll more  ( 1971 ) or Chafe ( 1970 )  , loosely extended . What is not taken into account is the fact that these models typically concentrate on ' nuclear ' arguments in verb-phrases  , saying little about ' peripheral ' roles , or about the structure of nominal or even adject ival groups  . This paper will show need for a more task-spec if ic model  , combining Valency and Case into an integrated theory for the purposes of translation  . 
More specifically , we will show ( a ) the need for a more flexible Valency system with six degrees of valency-binding instead of the usual two  ;   ( b ) the need for a finely tuned version of Case to fit the new version of Valency proposed : in part icular what depth of abstraction is appropriate  ; and ( c ) the need for this combined Case and Valency model to extend beyond verbs  , especially to nominal groups . 
2. Valency in existing MT systems
The essential notion borrowed from Valency theory found in MT is the distinction between ' complements ' and ' adjuncts '  . In several MT systems we find that the lexicon contains information equivalent to that given in a valency dictionary like that of Helbig & Schenkel  ( 1973 ) listing the complements predicted by the verb together with associated syntactic and semantic features  . This lexical information is used in astra ight forward manner to assist in the computation of structured representations for the source text  , with the complements and adjuncts labelled appropriately  . In this way for example , the functions of the prepositions in sentences like  ( la ) and ( 2a ) can be differentiated , and the correct translations ( ib-2b ) arrived at . 
la ) Erwart et auf seinem Freund.
\]b ) He is waiting for his friend.
2a ) Erwafter auf dem Bahnhof.
2b ) He is waiting at the station.
The identification of complements is useful in the bilingual transfer stage  ( or equivalent ) of the MT system , and it is appropriate at this point to provide a set of example translation pairs  ( 3 ) - ( 5 ) that illustrate an important problem that Valency can help with  . 
(3a ) He likes the girl.
(3b ) Lafille luiplait.
4a ) The farmer supplied the grocer with milk.
4b ) Lefer mier fournit dulaital'$picier.
5a ) CharIes entered the ' restaurant.
(5b ) Charlesentradartsle restaurant.
Each of the sentence pairs in ( 3 ) - ( 5 ) illustrates a change in complement structure between English and French  . The example with like and plaire is something of a classic  , involving a double argument change ; but examples like (4) and (5) , which , while less extreme , are nevertheless typical , suggest that the phenomenon is widespread . 
The Valency approach to this problem recognises each of the three verb pairs in  ( 3 ) - ( 5 ) as having the same valency , but as having different valency patterns , which must be mapped onto each other . 
In the case of Rothkel (1976) , this mapping is achieved by simp Iy juxtaposing the two entries  , with equivalent arguments next to each other , roughly as in Figure i . 
supply Ns(animate ) No ( animate ) Np ( with , physobj ) four nirNs ( animate ) N i ( animate ) No ( physobj ) Figurei . Valency patterns in Rothkegel ( 1976 ) Alternatively , in GETA's ARIANE-78 ( Vauquois , 1978) and TAUM-Aviation ( Lehrberger ,  1981) , the complements are assigned distinctive labels : in both systems the label ARG  ( ument ) is used with a distinctive affixed numeral , roughly as in (6) . 
(6a ) The farmer supplied the grocer with milk.

Notice that the scope of each type of element is the predicate plus those elements above it on the scale  . 
Thus , middles pertain to the predicate plus complements  ; adjuncts modify this extended predication ; extra-peripherals range over the entire sentence . 
4 ? How the extended system helps in MT
Let us now consider the effect of this concept on mapping of arguments in transfer in MT  . We assume that the general transfer algorithm has the possibility of correctly matching complements in corresponding valency patterns  ( whether by arbiitrary numbering , on a verb-by-verb basis , or using Case ) . 
We also assume that adjuncts and extra-per ipherals can be dealt with satisfactorily  . We must now consider what to do when , on a bilingual basis , there is some mismatch between the valency bindings of corresponding elements  . Notice that this is a major problem in the old two-valued system  . 
Tile most likely realisation of this problem seems to be as follows : assume that in a source language analysis of  ( 8 )  , with astone has been assigned our ' middle ' label  , whereas in the target language either ( i ) the equivalent argument is considered to be valency-bound for the predicate  ; or ( ii ) the equivalent argument would be regarded as whol ly circumstantial  . In the case of ( i ) we can treat the element as if it had been a complement all along : the valency pattern for the target verb will tell us what to do with it  . Likewise in the case of ( ii ) we can treat it as if we always knew it was an adjunct : depending on the nature of the algori thm for treating adjuncts  , we may be required to compute some more info rmation about it  ( its case role for example )   , but this is no problem . 
It is easy to see that a generalisation of this solution is one in which each degree of valency -binding in Figure  2 is allowed to map onto either itself , or its nearest neighbour in either direction . 
Thus , integral complements and ordinary complements should be compatible  , as should adjuncts and extra-peripherals . This blurring of the distinctiions up and down the hierarchy accords well within tuit ions  , which suggest that because the syntactic ( and semantic ) behaviour of elements at neighbourdng points on the hierarchy have aspects in common  , partial compatibility should be achievable . If we add , at the very top of the hierarchy , a notional empty or ' zero ' binding , we are even able to account for those cases where a verb plus integral complement in one language is expressed as a simple lexical verb in another  , as for example with the English and
French pairs in ( 9 ) :  ( 9  ) take part participer make a mistakes e tromper catch colds enr humer welcome fairs accue il rever semarchere narri Srestroke donner une carcase Problems would arise if analyses of two languages were so different that a complement in one was in the current two-value system  , this is common ) , or an integral mapped onto a middle , and so on . Nothing much could be done in such a case , and it can only be said that the single condit ion upon which this system depends is that that s ituation simply does not arise  . 
However , there is a second problem arising from the quest ion of nonmatching valency patterns  , and indeed , this is a problem for which Case seems to offer a solution  . The problem is this : in language A , verb V is considered to have two valency-bound arguments  , but in language B , the corresponding verb takes three complements . When we come to transfer between A and B , how do we know which two of the three complements specified for V in language B map onto the two specified for V in language A ?  5  . Case in MT Compared to the number of systems using Valency  , there are relatively few systems that use Case in MT  , even though there are a number of problems , as we have seen , with the bare Valency approach . Yet Case obviously has attractions for MT , especially due to its character as a bridge between syntax and semantics  . There is some dispute as to what amount of ' semantics ' is needed for successful translat ion  , or indeed whether Case can properly be described as being part of this ~ omain  . 
Nevertheless , we have seen in the previous sections at least two problems which  , we suggested , could be solved using Case . The first was the like/plaire example , wbere we had to have a special mapping algorithm , whether between arbitrary ARG labels , or between numbered ARG labels interpreted in terms of syntactic function  . The point about case labels in this example is that they will provide a non-arbitrary transfer medium which is intuitive in both languages  . If we extend the system to make it multil ingual  , the case for Case is even stronger , since it provides a single language-pair independent mapping in contrast to the necessary n  ( n-l )   ( for languges ) bilingual mappings , which might , remember , need to be replicated for almost every verb . Even in the problem case above , where analyses required non-neighbour mapping , a solution in terms of case labels suggests that the valency-blnding labels can be ignored where they do not help us  . And the Case solution to the final problemment ioned above-how to identify which arguments are considered in both languages to be valency -bound-is self-evident  . 
The point about Case is that it exactly meets the need in MT for a level of representation that is both deep enough to serve in a manner relative ly independent of surface form  , while still being shallow enough to allow a fairly straightforward mapping from and onto these other levels of description  ( i . e . surface syntax , canonical form , etc . ) . This view is countered by Tsujii (1982:382) , who claims that with only the shallow meaning representation afforded by Case  , one does not avoid the necessity to look still at specific verbs in order to interpret the case labels and so to determine the appropriate strategy  . But Tsujii wrongly attributes to advocates of Case for MT the idea that it should replace other forms of labelling in the representation of analysis  . 
It should be made clear that indeed information about syntactic configuration goes hand in hand with case structure information  . The introduction of case labels permits certain generalisations that can act as defaults to reduce the amount of explicit information associated with each verb  , in the manner of lexical rules in LF Gormet aru les in GPSG  . 
Although we may consider Fillmore's ( 1968 ) notions of a case-hierarchy for subject select ion  , or the association of prepositions with cases to be overstated  , this is only because he made the mistake of posi ting these as generalisations rather than defaults  . 
Of course , Case does introduce new problems , not least of which is the definition of a comfortable case set  . But this is not a design problem , but a development problem , and one would like to believe that the appropr iate case distinctions will become evident during a period of experimentation with a prototype system  . Like in any engineering ( as opposed to theoretical ) undertaking , one must be prepared for a period of flux where the appropriate tools are developed and modif ied  . 
It is appropriate at this point to look briefly at the extent to which Case is currently used in MT systems  . Perhaps the most extensive use of Case is found in LRC's METAL system  ( Lehmann et al 1980 )  . 
The system is basically transfer-based , with the results of a context-free parse of the source text passed to the ' case frame processor '  . Case frames are also used Jn transfer . The cases in the system are divided into two types  , ' central . ' and ' peripheral ' , corresponding roughly to the traditional Valency distinction between complements and adjuncts respectively  . 
A key aspect of the METAL conception of central and peripheral cases is that these form two discrete sets of eases  . This means that each of the cases that are recognized is regarded as either typically " conditioned by the particular verb " or not verb-specific  . However , it is reeognised that " . . . a few classes of verbs may be closely associated with arguments which are usually considered per ipheral for most verb classes "  ( Lehmann et al 1980:1-24 )  , the example given being verbs of motion which often specify a locative complement  . 
Lexieal entries indicate the range of cases for each verb  , for each of which three types of subcategorizat ion information are given  , as follows: ( a ) the ' ~ emantic type ' of the argument ;   ( b ) its canonical syntactic role ( surface case )  ; ( c ) the syntactic form of the argument , i . e . the kind of constituent expected for each argument  , c . g . clause , noun phrase , prepositional phrase , adverb . 
In addition , verbs are assigned to a ' transitivity type ' . This feature gives the " potential configurat ion of arguments "  , that is , relating the possible ease roles to the canonical syntactic roles according to the mood and voice of the verb  . This feature does add information not expressed elsewhere  , even though at first sight it would appear only to corroborate tile correspondence between deep and surface caI ~ e : it is according to transit ivity type that rules regarding sentence forms other than simple active indicative can be generalised  . 
In contrast with traditional approaches to Case , note that requirements regarding semantic and syntactic restrictions are not necessarily d irectly associated with the cases  , as was found in Fillmore's original ( 1968 ) proposal , but can be specified for individual verbs , though a system of defaults does apply . 
The case frame processor attempts to ' use up ' the available arguments by matching them to the specifications given in the lexical entry for the verb  , and then applies general ' case functions ' associated with the peripheral cases to the remaining arguments  . If all the arguments can be legally assigned case roles  , then the clause Js considered well-formed . Otherwise , tile rule in deemed to have failed , and an alternative frame processor is tried . 
Case frames are also used in transfer , primarily to order the constituents and assign them appropriate syntactic function markers  . Sometimes , if a case is ' marked ' , there might also be a change in syntactic form , most often ( presumably ) from noun phrase to prepositional phrase or vice versa  . 
Lack of space prevents us from looking closely at the list of cases used  . The list of central roles more or less reflects the consensus view  . In addition , fully 25 major and additional peripheral ro\] . es of a rather less abstract nature are proposed . 
Of interest in the documentation describing the case roles Js that some of them are exemplif ied in noun frames rather than verb frames  ( see below )  . More bizar reperhaps is that although these roles are allegedly typically peripheral  , many of the examples given show them being used as ' obligatory ' arguments  , somewhat undermining the central-peripheral distinction  . This leads us to our most important comment on the METAL system  , with regard to the central-peripheral dist inction  . There is a serious problem , if we admit the possibility of using these cases also for ' obligatory ' roles  , of conflict between these more specific and the slightly more general central cases  . For example , there is an Material case , as in (10a ) , which would however also seem a good alternat ive candidate to Target  ( = Patient ) for the surface object of use in ( iOb )  . 
(10a ) John built the wall out of bricks.
(10b ) John used bricks to build the wall.
Myown proposals will show how this kind of problem might be addressed  , in particular by making a stricter distinct ion between ' central ' and ' peripheral ' cases  , though allowing the latter as ' secondary ' labels attaching to the former where necessary  . 
6. Valency and Case in MT
In this section I wish to present a synthesised view of the use of Valency and Case in MT  , taking into account the points raised above . In the following discussion , I assume a transfer-rather than interlingua -based approach  , in keeping with current views on this dichotomy . 
Remembering the necessity to keep transfer as small as possible  , we can see the motivation for introducing the degree of shallow semantics offered by Case  . We saw in Section 2 the problems associated with transfer based solely on labels distinguishing only between complements and adjuncts  . We have also seen in Section 5 how the additional , information 12t carried by case labels simplifies the mapping of arguments in transfer  . We should also take into consideration the fact ( cf . Somers , in press ) that all the traditionally proposed cases ( with the exception of Patient ) can occur both as complements and adjuncts , even simultaneously . It seems therefore that the key to transfer is a label indicating both a case relation and the valency-binding of that element  , so that each constituent is uniquely ident if iable  . We also seek to incorporate the additional va lency-binding values  ( integral , middle and extra-peripheral ) introduced in Section 3 . 
For guidance as regards the choice of a set of cases  , I would like to propose an adaptation of the approach found in METAL  ( discussed above )  , where there is a strJ . ct distinction between the cases used for central and peripheral roles  . We saw in our discussion above that some uneasiness results from the combination of general and specific cases  , since often both a general ( traditional ) and a specific case assignment seems appropriate  . The approach I wish to propose here involves the definition of a relatively small set of traditional cases which are associated primari ly with complements  . The notion ' relatively small'must of course be expanded  . The cases in this set will be rather abstract in the manner of traditional cases  . Because they are to be used essentially to d is tinguish valency-bound elements  , and because the maximum possible valency for any verb is probably four  , we could argue for having only that many of these ' inner cases '  . However , we also want to take advantage of them nemonic value of the case names  , so as to make assignment of case labels ( by humans , perhaps in relatively independent research groups  ) as easy as possible . The number and exact values of these cases is to be fixed by some preliminary research  , and is not in my view an issue of import . The important point is that this set be fixed , i . e . forming a closed set , so that one of the cases can be used quite expl icitly as a ' waste basket ' or neutral case  ( cf . Mellema ,  1974 ) for those instances where there is no obvious case assignment  . 
Judicious and motivated elaboration of the case-set will reduce such instances to a minimum  . 
A further range of less abstract cases will serve for the remaining degrees of valency-binding- middles  , adjuncts and extra-peripherals . These will typically be more specific , and their character determined by particulart ranslation problems as they arise during the development stage of the system  . Some suggestions of candidates for this list can be found in the METAL documentation  . Given the existence of these specific cases , it would be quite acceptable to use them as secondary labels in conjunction with the tradit ional cases  ( particularly , perhaps , the neutral case ) , again as and where necessary or helpful , though their presence would not typically be a requirement for transfer  . They might , for example , be found to be of assistance in choosing appropr iate surface structures in generation for some target language  , though not for another . 
There remains the problem of the roles of arguments in nonverbal constituents  , since these too have a dependency structure . Furthermore , the recognition of the nature of these relat J . on ships is often essential in translation . Compare the noun groups in (11) , all of which have a similar syntactic structure  , but which represent different translation patterns in French  , depending on the relationship ( 11 a ) a steam train untrain ~ vapeur ( 111 ) ) a footbal l pitch un terrain de foot ( llc ) a cotton shirt une chemise encot on ( l l d ) the baby linenleling epour bSbKAlthoughi t could be argued that these noun phrases could be treated as individual compound lexica\] items  , the type of construction they exemplify is typical  , widespread , and such'compounds'occur freely in novel combinations  , often involving a larger number of elements ( 12 ) :  ( 12 a ) the Genevape ace talks ( 12b ) SD Pelection campaign promises ( 12c ) North Seaoil . field offshore rigadministration These pose considerable problems when they are translated into languages in which such opaque compounds cannot be formed and where the relat ionships between the elements are made more explicit  . Therefore , these relationships must be represented at i nput to transfer  . Indeed this has been recognised as a problem in t ranslation  ( human or mechanical )   , and Case suggested as a descriptive mechanism for such structures  ( e . g . Bauer , 1978; Mackenzie , 1983) .   . Myown approach would be to propose that the case set be supplemented by a number of relations specifically suited to noun groups : these would be compatible with the cases already established  , with as large an overlap as possible . 
Clearly , in the case of complex noun groups whose head is derived from a verb  , either as a direct nominal is at Jon (13a ) , as a cognate form ( 14 a ) or even perhaps when the link is essentially semantic  ( 15 a )  , there is no reason why the range of cases ( and valency bindings ) that would apply in the corresponding verbal predications  ( 13 b , 14 b , 15b ) could not be employed within the noun group . 
(13a ) the possible future dismissal of teachers for incompetence  ( 13 b ) Teachers will possibly be dismissed in future for incompetence  . 
(14a ) my mother's temporary loss of memory ( 14 b ) Mymother has temporarily lost her memory . 
(15a ) Everton's recent 61 home victory over Arsenal ( 15 b ) Evert on recently beat Arsenal by 61 at home . 
By the same token , nouns not so related to verbs must be seen as heads with arguments in some relation  . 
Work on nominal valency ( e . g . Sommerfeldt & Schreiber , 1977; Teubert ,  1979 ) has recognised that many nouns can be attr ibuted ' valency patterns '  , and Pi~ha ( 1980 ) and Mackenzie ( 1983 ) have taken a Case approach to the problem . Among their findings is the observation that while almost no nouns take obligatory complements  , many noun modifiers can be regarded as valency -bound  ( e . g . the noun book has complements indicating author , subject and contents , signalled by by , about and of respectively ) . 
Furthermore , there are a number of case-like relations that are appropriate for noun modifiers  , among them almost certainly an essentially nentra \] one  , for use-in the context of MT-when the returns out to be no need to compute the reJationship : at L rihutive adjectives may be an example of this  . 
It is not my intention here to establish , discuss and justify such a set of rela ~ . ions . In any case , only by extens Jve research and experiment at i on with a working syst  , em coulds ne expect be ab\]e to discover the range of relations needed  . 
7. Conclusion
It has been the : intent\]on ofth : is paper to n lake a statement about tile proper approach to the use of case and Valency J  . nMT . Ontile one hall d , I have presented a proposal to aband on the old two-~JermValency system ill favour of a new six -term system  , and have explored the consequences of such a change  . 
In connection with this , I have tried to show where Casefits in . What this research perhaps lacks at this point in time is empirical evidence that such an approach is valid  , and an accompany : ing set of case names for the various relations  . It could be argued that tlle latter is a prerequisite for the former  , though I would prefer to claim that the demonstration of the validity of the approach and the elaboration of a ' comfortable ' set of cases form an essenl  ; ially unif : ied research task . This paper , ellen , has explained tile Lheoretica \] background to such a Lask  .
