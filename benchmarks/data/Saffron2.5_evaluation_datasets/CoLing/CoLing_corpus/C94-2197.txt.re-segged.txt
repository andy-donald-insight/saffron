User modeling is an iml > ortant COlnponents of dialog systems  . Most previous approaches are rule-based methods , hit his paper , we proims e to represent user models through Bayesian networks  . Some advantages of the Bayesian approach over the rule-based approach are as follows  . First , rules for updating user models are not necessary because up < lating is directly performed by the ewduation of the network base<lon probal > ility theory  ; this provides us a more formal way of dealing with uncertainties  . Second , the Bayesian network pro:rides more detailed information of users ' knowledge  , because the degree of belief on each concept is provided in terms of prol ~ ability  . We prove these advantages through a prelinfinary experiment  . 
1 Introduction
Recently many researchers have pointed out that user modeling is important in the study of  ( tiMog systems . Usern : o<h ! ling does not just render a dialog syst  (  , nl more cooperative , lint constitutes an in dis-1 ) ensable l ) rerequisite fin " any flexible ( lialog in a wider < tomain \[9\] . The user models interact closely with all other components of the system and often cannot easily be separated from them  . For examph , , the inl ) ut an Mysis component refers to tile user's knowledge to solve referent iMambiguities  , and tile output generation component does the same for h  , xicalel , oices . 
The con <: epts are usually explained l > y showing their relations to the other known concepts  . Thus , for the < lialog system it is importantoguess what the user knows  ( user's knowledge ) in order to explain new con-cel ) ts in terms of know , t concepts . For examl/le , con:sider that tit( , system explains the location of a restaurant to the user  . It might 1) euseless to tell the . user the position in terms of the Ml solut e < : oordinate system  , since the user's mental model is not based on the absolute coordinate  . Therefore , the system should show the relative location frmn the lo  ( : ation tit ( ' user alrea ( ly knows . It is difficult to predict which locations the user  , whol ) erhaps is a stranger to the system , knows . 
Though the syst:em <: ouh lattem l ) to a ( ' quire the information l/y asking the user al ) outher k , towle(lge , too many questions mayirritate the user . Such a system is considered mechanical and not helpful  . Therefore , t i t ( " system is required to guess the user's knowledge by finding clues in the user's utterance and to refine the user's model incrementally  . 
In the user modeling component of UC\[5\] , several stereotyped user models which vary the user's level of expertise were prepared beforehand and the appropriate model was selected based  o1: the user's utterances . Ill the approach used by Wallis and Short lifl'e \[12\]  , the expertise h , vel was assigned to all concepts in the user model  . The system guessed the user's level , and the concepts with the expertise level lower than her level are considered to be known by her  . This n : o(lel can deal with t it ( . ' level of expertise more appropriately than UC , because the system does not have to prepare the nmltiple usern lodels for each expertise h  , vel . 
The approach of pr < . ' paring several user models and adopt it , gone , however , is a nal>l > roximation fuser modeling . The expertise level of t it ( : user is continuous and , in general , the unique measure melfl : of expertise level is not appropriate for some domMns  , specifically the domain of town guidance consi < lere < l in this paper  , because the areas that are known differ with the users  . 
Another problem of user modeling is updating the nm de las the  ( tialog progresses . At the beginning of the diMogue the system cannot expect the user nm < M to be accurate  . As the di Mogue progresses the . system can acquire clues of the user's knowledge fl ' om his utter-anees  . Also , the system can assume that the concepts mentioned are known to the user  . Thus . updating the user model shouhl1 ) eperformed incrementally . 
One difficulty of updating usernm dels is dealing with uncertainties  . The clues that can be obtained from the user's utterances are uncertain  , the iltfol'nla-tiol ( may conlli <: t with what has been hi , rained , and , as a result , the user mo < lel may be revised . The effects of the syst tnn's explanation are also uncertain  . Furthermore , reasoning about the user's kuowledge must be performed Oil the basis of uncertainties  . Most previous apl ) roaches to this prolflem are rule-based metho ( ts . 
Cawsey \[2\] sorted the update rules in order of their reliability and applied them in this order  . In another approach , tit ( . , mechanisnl such as TMS\[6\] or nomnono-tonic logic\[l\] , is used to maintain the consistency of pol ; entiM defect for dealing with unt:ertMnties\[4\] .

The type of sentences may de I ) endont it ( : application we pursue . For general explanation , it is important to make a ( : lear distinction between tile two user's states ; knowing tile name of a conceI ) t and knowing the other attril > nte of tile coucel ) t . For example , suppose the user asked the following : " Where is FRISCO ? " where FRISCO is the name of a record store  . From this question , the system infers that the user knows the name of the store  , but does not know its location . 
Now we will give a precise definition of our language  . 
All the sentence , s in the language have the form ( la , beI ) : ( co , , , t ,   .  ,  . t ) where ( label ) is one of PRE , POST , JUDGE , TOLD , and TELL , and ( content ) is represented by a termeftile first-order predicate ' logic  . An object and an expertise field are represented by an atomic symbol  , and an attribute of an object is represented by a fimction syml  ) ol . For example , store 001 ( object ) , records_collector ( expertise field ) , location ( store001) ( attributc) , and so forth . 
The user's knowledge about an attribute is represented by five sentences  , all having the same ( content ) representing t . he attribute , and one of the five labels . 
The sentenees labeled PRE , express that the user knows the attril Lutct ) rior to the < lialogue session , while those labeled POST , express that the user has come to know it during the session  . For instan<:e , PRE : lo-cation ( store001 ) means that the user have a h'eady knows the h ) catiou of store 001 bet or c the interaction starts , whih . ' POST : location ( store001 ) means the user has <: ome to know the location through the sys-tem's explanation  . The sentences labeled JUDGE , express the user's ( : urrent knowledge and is used to exploit tile user mo < lelby other coml > < ments in the dialogue system  . For instance , JUDGE : loca-tion(store001) means the use . r now know st it ( . ' location of store001 . The sentences labele<l TOLD an ( lTELL , express the evi < le . nce , gained by the user's utterance and the system's explanation  . F < L r instance , TOLD : name ( store001 ) means the user hasiLL-dicated by the clues that she knows the name of s  tore001  , while TELL:name ( store001 ) means the system has explai , m < t the name . For exception , in the case of location , the form TELL : location ( X )   ( wh creX is some obje ( : t\[l ) ) is not usc<l because a location is explained in terms of the relative h  ) cation of another object . Instead , the form TELL : relation ( X , Y ) ( where X and Y are someol ) ject IDs ) is used . 
T i t ( . ' sentences representing objects and exi ) ertisc fields have only the label PRE . The sentence representing an object ( e . g . PRE : store001 ) means that the user knows the object , that is she knows , nost of the attributes of the object . The sentence representing an expertise rich\[ ( e . g . PRE : records_collector ) means thai : the user is a nexl ) ert of the field , that is she knows the objects related to the expertise field  . 
3.2 Constructing the Networks
As mentioned , arcs of the Bayesian network represent direct probablistic influence between linked variables  . 
Tim directionality of the arcs is essential for rei  ) resent-ing nontransitive dependencies . In order to represent the knowledge in terms of Bayesian Network  , we must interpreth equalitative relation betwee . n the sentences that are represented by our language as a directed arc or some such combination of arcs  . 
In our ease , the network has two subnetworks . One represents the user's knowledge be . for e the dialog session , which is used to guess the user's model fronlher utterances  . The sentences assign e < l to the nodes in this part have either the label PRE or TOLD  . We call this subnetwork the prior part . The other sulmet-work in which the nodes have either the label POS To i ' TELL is used to deal wil  ; htit (' , influence of the sys-tem's utterances . This sulmet work we call the posterior part . It is important ; omakea clear distinction . 
Considering that the system explains a concept , it is not proper to assume that the user knows some other related concepts  . For example , if tile user utters that she knows some location x then it can be inferred that she also knows locations that are  ( : los (  ; to x . But that is not true if the location x is explained by the system  . 
The relations ill the prior part of the network are categorized into four types as follows :  ( 1 ) tl , e relations between objects in an expertise field ( 2 ) the relations between attributes of obje ( : ts ( 3 ) the relations lmtween a nol ) je <- t and its attributes ( 4 ) the relations betwee . nanatt , ' i bute of an object and the evi < lence that the user knows it The relations  ( 1 ) are ( : oncerL , ed with the expertise fiehl . The objects ill the same expertise field are related through the expertise field node  . We introduce the arcs that go from the expertise tMd no < le to the ob-je <: tnodes belonging to that fiel  ( 1 . For example , ares goDora the node of " records collector " to that of " Compact Disk "  , " Tower Records " ( name of a record store ) and so on . The level of expertise can be controlled by the conditi<mal probal  ) ilities assigned to the object nodes conditioned by tile ext  ) ertiset Md node . In this framework , we can intro < hL ce arbitrary numbers of expertise fiekls  , all of which can be assigned the level of expertise  . 
'\]/ here . lations (2) are conce . rned with the < loln a in knowledge . In our domain , those are the relations between the locations , whi < : h are based on the assumption that the user l  ) robably knows the locations close to the location she known  . TILe relations are assunn . 'd to be symmetric . A single direct e < larc of Bayesian networks does not represent a symmetric relation  . In ordeL ' to rel ) resent a symmetric relation , we introduce a dummy evi(tence node , whereby two arcs go forth from the two location nodes as shown in figure  1  . The prior dlllnlfiy lit ) do
