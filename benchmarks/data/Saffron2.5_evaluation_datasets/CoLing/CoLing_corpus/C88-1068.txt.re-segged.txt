Abstract
In the present paper communicative cycle ( CC ) is considered as a dialog arising between two partners during solving a problem  . Communicative strategy ( C5 ) is seen as a general scheme by which a dialog participant is guided in achieving his goal  . 
CC is described in terms of the goals of the par ticipants and CS  . 
I , Introduction
Dialog is a bilateral process the par~tic ipants of which communicate each other messages concerning the surrounding world  . 
Each participant interchangingly under takes the role of the author or the recip i ent  . 
For communication to be possible the commu-n icants must understand each other  , i . e . 
% halt knowledge of language and about the world must have a shared part  . Each partici-pant should also know some th ing about the partner-his goals  , knowledge , possibili-ties , etc . 
The task of a dialog model is a formal descrip tion of the process of communication or  , in a narrower sense , description of the communicative structure of the text  ( speech ) generated by the communicants in this process . Such description may be represented , for example , in the form of a generative grammar or graph/ Robinson  1982  , Metzlng 1981/ and it can be realized on a computer . 
One of the aims of working out the dialog models is just to facilitate the communica- tion of man with the computer  , bringing it nearer to man-to-man communication  . 
Next we consider some problems arising in s imulating dialog interaction  . 
2 . Communicative cycle and communicatives tra tegy We limit ourselves only to treating such dialogs where the communicants  ( let solve some problems . 
The unit of simulation will be communi- cative cycle  ( CC )  . We define CC as dialog arising between two partners during solving a problem  . 
CC consists of the alternate turn-ta-k ings of the communicants though not every such sequence forms a CC  . The turns are built up of communicative acts ( CA )  . The minimal combination in a CC is a couple or triplet of turn-takings Of the partic ipants  ( cf . /Langleben 1984/) , for example A : ques-tion-B : answer , or A : question-B : answer-A : acceptance of the answer  . Any CC starts with setting up a communicative goal by one of the participants  ( A )  . Let the goal of Abe " B does a deed D ' ? . In natural communica-tlon achieving a goal requires more than one communicative turn- taking from both A and B  . 
Typically , A has some obstacles in achieving D : e . g . B does not want to do D ; B does not realize that not doing D involves negative consequences  ; B thinke that he is not able to do D , etc . For this reason A must , in addition to fixing the goal , also determine the resources he has a this d is posal for overcoming these obstacles  , and the way of using these resources-it means that A must outline the communicative strategy  . 
Having fixed the goal G , A tries to direct the relevant intellectua l and emotio-nal processes of B  ( his interests , assessments , opinions ) during the process of communication in such a way as to eventually lead B to a decision to do D  . In doing so influencing the partner is actua lly directed at certain aspects of his mind : his knowled-ge  , assumptions , assessments , wishes . These relevant aspects of the mind of the par tner may be called his psychic parametrs s  , in short P-paramstres . The decision of B to perform D depends upon the concrete confi-guration of the values of his P-parametres o The unfavourabls values are % he obstacles mentioned above  . The essence of applying a ~ t ~ ategy lies in the fact that A organizes hist ~ iPn-takings to B in such a way that their r ~  ) sult 6 will be a change in the values of fi ~ ) dP-parametres in a required direction : increasing his knowledge  , changing his assess m~3 nts , increasing his conviction , Pe-ducing or increasing his wishes , and so on . 
Within ; 1 fixed strategy certain P-parametres are chosen which can be influenced  , the di?ectlon and ways of influence ( e . gostra-tegies of threa % enlng , scaring , tempting , convinc : Lng ~ etc ) ~With respect to the primary comlaunic at lvegoal the changing of the values of P-parametres may be called " instrumental goal "  . 
The development of the theory of com-municat ~ ive strategies thus presupposes the develop r ~ ont of a theory of the P-parametres  . 
I % wo ui~d be part of a certain qualitative theory of decls lon-making and should  , in addition ? o explicating the system of P -parametres  , explain also the influence of P-paramet %' esupon the decisions made by a person  . The factors that must be taken Into accoun ? in shaping a decision apenumerous  . 
But it turns out that thls diversity can be reduced to a limited number of p~imary paPa -metres  . We can bring forth the following types of P -parametres : assessments  ( rational evaluations and those of pleasantness )  ; knowled ~ e ( also skills , experience ); into-rests ; requirements ( wishes , needs , among them a needfop communication ) . 
Th ~ explication of all possible P-paramet l'es requires additionalinestlgations  ( first of all psychological )   . In a model of dialog the P-parametres of a communicative partner mare up one part of the model of partner  , During communication some of these values ~ tay undergo changes  . 
3 . Simulating the communicative cycle First of all let us describe the process of formalizing the notion of communica-%irestt  , ategy ( CS ) . 
CS may be defined as a procedure which deformities the choice of an author's com~municat Jve acts  . This choice need not be unique . In this respect CS differs from strategy in the game theory Or from a plan of communication  . 
The author A has fixed his communlca=tive str . a tegy if hei ) \] = asestablished the set of P-parametres of the partner B relevant ' to his commun i -cative goal Git  ) knows in case of every relevant P-para-metre whether in order to achieve the goal G it is necessary to increase or lower the required value iii  ) has determined among the relevant P-parametres one parametre  , changing the value of which is the Immed la % e goal G of implementing the strategy iv  ) knows in case of every relevant P--para-metrehow to change its values either directly with the help of certain CAs  , or indirectly , by changing the values of other

Let us consider one example of CS . Let the goal of % heau ? hor A of the strategy be
Gz " B perform sadeed D " .
( I ) The relevant P-parame % res of B : a wish to do D assessment of positive consequences of D assessment of negative consequences of D knowledge of the fulfillment of the precond it ions of D  , etc . 
(2 ) Let A know that B's wish % ode D is lower than required for doing it  . 
(3  ) Let the P-parametme A wan?s to change be B's wlsh to do D  ( which needs increasing )  . 
This is the immediate goal Gi of the strategy.
(4 ) P-parametres " assossmen ? " and " knowled-ge " can be influenced d~rectly by such com-munl cat iveacts as " giving information "  , " explanation " , " substantiation " . 
The P-papametre " wish to do D " can be influenced only indirectly  , through some other P-parametres , e . g . bF increasing B's assessment of positive consequences of D  , by lowering B's assessment of negative consequences of D  , by increasing B's knowledge about the fulfil lment of preconditions of D  . 
The goal G 1 of applying this strategy is to increase B's wish to do D  . This may proceed in different ways ( by setting up some subgoals and applying corresponding suB strategles  ) : A may increase B's assessment of the posi-tive consequence of D  ( by giving information of them , substantiating and explaining ) , i . e . to allure , cajole ; A can lower B's assessment of negative con ~ sequences of D  ( by giving information , heSS ) , i . e . towarn , threaten , scare : A can increase B's ~ nowledge about the fulfillment of the preconditions of D  ( e . g . 
by informing B about the availabilit F of resources required for doing D  , explaining it ) , i . e . tO convince . 
The communicative strategy does not de?ermine uniquely the way of achieving a goal  ( the sequence of communicative acts of the par tners  ) but leaves the freedom of choice . Constructing the next turn depends among oi he P things upon the changes which have been brought about in the partne~?s model by the informat ion received during interpreting the prev ious turn-takings of the partner  ( for e Mample , it may happen % hat some assumptions of the author about the partner do not hold  )  . 
The communicative cycle proceeds as follows ( participants A and B , A is the initiator of communication , G is the com~municative goal of A ) . 
In accordance with special rules of interest / Saluveer  , elm 1986/ A finds the P-parametres of B relevant to the goal G  . On the basis of the partner model A determines the necessary changes in the values of these parametres  . Next , A chooses a relevant P . -parametre which value needs changing . In ? his way he chooses his communicatives ? ra -tegy the goal Gi of which is changing the va lue of the chosen P-parametr ~  ( in such a ~ a yas is ~ equired for achieving the goal G  )  . In case of every F-pa~ametreA knows either the list of CAs or the list of other P-parame % resthrough which i % is possible to increase or lower % he value of the chosen P ~ parametre  . 
In order to achieve the goal G 1 A has therefore either to choose a CA from a given ~ list or determl neanew P-parametre  ( which , in its turn , determined a new communicative stra?egy which is par % of ' the initial CS  ) and m are up the next turn-ta~ing . 
Partner B whose goal does not need coinside with the goal G determines  , according to % he rules of interest , th ~ P-pare-metres of partne ~ A which are relevant to his goal  . On the basis of the model of A(i . e . his partner model ) B determines % he necessary changes in these pa ~ a metres  . Ba\]sofi Meshis communicatives t~ategy ~ a ~ did A  .
