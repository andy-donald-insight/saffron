We des((tiletile design of Comlex Syntax , aco , n puta-tional lexicon providing detailed syntactic iuformation ff  ) rapproximately 38 , 000 English head words . We consider the types of errors which arise in creating such a lexicon  , and how such errors can be measured and controlled  . 
1Goal
The goal of the ( : omlex Syntax project is to create a moderately -broad-coverage lexicon recording the syntactic features of gnglist  ; words for purposes of cou > putation a language analysis  . This dictionary is being developed at New York University and is to he distributed by the Linguistic Data Consortimn  , to be freely usable for both research and commercial purposes by members of the Consortium  . 
In order to ineet the needs of a wide range of an ~> lyzers  , we have in chlded a rich set of syntactic features and haw ~ aimed to characterize these Datures in a relatively theory-neutral way  . Inl ) articn lar , the feature set is more detailed than those of the major commercial dictionaries  , such ; us the Oxford Adwmced Learner's Dictionary ( OALI ) ) \[ d \] and the Longnum Dictionary of Contemporary English  ( LDOCE )  \[8\] , which haw ~ I ) een widely used as a source o\['lexicali , ,for , ,lal , ioilill \]; lll-guage analyzers . 1In addil . ion , we have a hned to be irio , ' ecOrrl preheii sive ill captur hig featt , res(hi partic . u-\]ar , stibcategorization\['eatures ) than co , iI , llercial dictlonaries . 
2 Structure
Tile word list was derived fi'on , the file prepared by Prof . Roger Mitten from the Oxford Adwn , ced Learner's Dictionary , and contains about 38 , 000 head forms , although some purely British terms have been omitted  , loach entry is organized as a nested set of typed feature-vahleists  . We currently use a Lisplike parenthesized list notation  , although the lexicon couhl IT of a cilii ~ ate the transition to COMLEX by currenl  , users of these dictionaries , we have i ) reparcd mappings froln COMI , EX classes to those of several other dictionaries .

The first syml/olgives the part of speech ; a word with several parts of speech will have several dictionary entries  , one for each part of speech . Eache , itry has all : orth foat ilre , giving the base fO , ' lfl of tile word , No , in s , verbs , and adjectiw ~ s with irregular I nor phology will liave feat t  , res for their regular fo ,  . ir is : plural ,: past ,: past part , etc . Words which take con- , i ) leirients will have a subcatego , ' ization(:sube)\['eat , ire . For exaniple > the verb " ai ) and on " eali occur with a Il Ollriphrase followed by a prepositional phrase with t impreposition " to "  ( e . g . , "1 abandoned hii , i to the linguists . ") or with just a , lOll , , phrase comple i f ient ( "\[ aball done ( l the shill . ") . 
Other syntactic features are recorded under : features  . 
For example , the noun " abandon " is marked as ( countable : pval ( " wlth " ) ) , indicating that it must appear in the singular with a deter  , niner unless it is preceded by the prepos Zion " with "  . 
2.1 Subcategorization
We have paid p~u'ticular attention to providing detailed subcategorization information  ( information about complement sructure )  , both for verbs and for tllose nouns and adjectives which do take cmnl  ) lements . 
In order to insure the COml ) leteness of our codes , we studied the codiuge ) ul ) loyed by s ( we ral other u , a jor texicous , includh , g ( , he Ih ' and eis Verh Lexlcolt2 , the A(J QIJII , EX Prc , ject\[10\] , the NYU Linguistic Stringl'roject\[9\] , the OALI ) , and IA)OCI'\] , a , nd , whenever feasiMe , haw ~ sought to incorporate distinctions made in any of these all  ( tie , tortes . ( ) ur resulting feature sys-ten , includes 92 subcategorization features Ibrw ~ rbs , 14 for adjectives , and 9 for llO , , ns . These features record dilforences in grammatical functional structure as well as constituent structure  . In particular , tl , ey Calfl . ure four differentypes of control : subject control  , object control , variable control , and arbitrary control . Furthermore , the notation allows us to indicate that verl ) Irlay haw ~ dill > rent control features for different comlflement struct m'es ~ or ewm for dilrerent prepositions within the complement  . We record , for example , that " blame . . . on " involves arbitrary control ( " lie2l ) ew doped by J . ( ih ' in ; sha . w and I . .lackendoff .

4 Types and Sources of Error
As\] ) art of the process of refining the dictionary and as-suring its quality  , we have spent considerable r sources on reviewing dictionary entries and on occasion have had sections coded by two or even four of the elves  . 
This process has allowed us to make some analysis of the sources and types of error in the lexicon  , and how these errors might be reduced . We . can divide the sources of error and inconsistency into four classes :  1  . errors of classification : where an instance of a word is improperly analyzed  , and in particular where the words following a verb are not properly identified with regard to complement type  . SI ) e-eific types of problems include misclassifying adjuncts as arguments  ( or vice versa ) and identifying the wrong control features . Our primary defenses against such errors have been a steady refinement of tile feature deseril  ) tions in ollrnlanlla \] and rel ' ; -ulargrou I ) review sessions with all the elves . Ill particular , we have developed detailed criteria for making adjunct/argument distinctiol is\[O\]  . 
A1) reliminary study , conducted on examples ( drawn at random from a corpus not used for our concordance  ) of verbs beginning with " j " , indicated that elves were consistent 93% to 94% of the time in labeling argument/adjunct distinctions following our criteria and  , in these eases , rarely disagreed on the subcategorization . I more than half of the cases where there was disagree-then  (  , the elves separately flagged these as drill-cult , ambiguous , or figurative uses of the verbs ( and therefore would probably not use them its the basis for assigning lexical features  )  . The agreement rate for examl ) les whict i were not flagged was 96% to 98% . 
2 . on iitted features : where an ell ' omits a Dature because it is not suggested by an example in the concordance  , a citation ill the dictionary , or the elf's introspection . In order to get an est . ilnate of the niag , itude of this problem we decided to establish a measure of coverage or " recall " for the subcategorization Dal  . ures assigned by our elves . 
" lb do this , we tagged the first 150 " j " verbs from a randomly selected corpus from a part of the San Diego Mercury which was not in chlded in our concordance and then compared the dictionary entries created by our lexicographers against the tagged e or pt is  . The restllts of this coln parison are sliown in Figure  3  . 
~ Phe " ( ~ omplements only " is the percentage of instances in the corpus covered by the subcategorization tags assigned by the elves and does not include the identification of i ~ r l y l  ) rel ) ositions or adverbs . ' l'lie " ( ~ oinl ~ lements only " would correspond rougllly to the type of inforinal  , ion provided by OALI ) and l , I . )()(\] Jl'\]4 .

aprel ) osition list that is a little rich for a given verbI  ) ut we have decided to err on the side of a slight overgeneration rather thall risk missing all y prel  ) ositions which actually occur . As you can see , the removal of the ILl ) Il Ls from consideration improves the in ( lividualel fscores . 
The elfunion score is the union , of the lexical entries for all fcmrelves . These are certainly nuln-bets to be proud of , but realistically , having the verbs clone four sel ) a rate times is not I ) ractical . 
l lowew ~ r , in our original proposal we stated that because of the complexity of the verb entries we wouhl like to have them done twice  . As can be see ilinl : igure 5 , with two passes we su('ce , ,d hi raising individual percentages in all cases . 
We would like to make clear that evell in tim two cases where our individu M lexicographers miss  18% and 13% of the complements , there was only one instance in which this might have resulted in the inability to parse a sentence  . This was a missing in transit Ne . Otherwise , the missed cOnll ) le-rnents wouhl have been analyzed as adjuncts ince they were a combination of prepositional phrases and adverbials with one case of a suhordinal  . eccm-jline ( ion ~ as " . 
We endeavored to make a comparison with
LDOCE on the measurement . This was a bit difficult since LDOCE lacks some con  , plements we have and combines others , not always consistently . 
For instance , our PP roughly corresponds to either 1 , 9  ( our Pl'/al ) Vl ' ) or l ) rep/adv+T1 ( e . g . " on "3 .

I lowever , this problem does not appear to be very severe . A review of tile " j " verb entries produced by all four elves indicates that the fraction of spurious entries ranges from  2% to 6%  . 
d . fl ~ zzy features : feature assignment is defined in terms of the acceptability of words in particular syntactic frames  . Acceptability , however , is often not absolute but a matter of degree . A verb may occur primarily with particular complements  , but will be " acceptable " with others . 
This problem is eompmmded by words which take on particular features only in special contexts  . 
Thus , we don't ordinarily think of " dead " as being gradable  ( * " Fred is more dead than Mary . "), but we do say " deader than a door nail " . It is also compounded by our decision not to make sense distinctions initially  . For examl ) le , many words which are countable ( require a determiner before the singular form ) also have a generic sense in which the determiner is not required  ( * " Fred bought apple . " but " Apple is a wonderflfl flavor . ") . For each such problematic feature we have prepared gnidelines for the elves  , but these still require considerable discretion on their part  . 
' Fhese problems have emphasized for nst be imp of tanee of developing a tagged corpus in conjunction with the dictionary  , so that frequency of occurrence of a feature ( and frequency by text type ) will be available . We have done stone preliminary tagging in par-aim with the completion of our initial dictionary  . We expect to start tagging in earnest in early summmer  . 
Our plan is to begin by tagging verbs in the Brown corpus  , in order to be able to correlate our tagging with the word sense tagging being done by tim WordNet group on the same corpus  \[7\]  . We expect to tag at least 25 instances of each verb . If there are not enough occurrences in tim Brown Corlms  , we will use examples from the same sources as our extended corpus  ( s~e above )  .
