The system of transparent intensional logic ( TIL ) intro-
duced by Pavel Tich ~ is used as a framework for a description of knowledge representation in n~n-machine con  , nunication . 
A detailed exposition of TIL can be found in /1  /  . 
A language expression denotes an object by expressing its construction  . The syntactic structure of the expression reflects the structure of the correspond ing construction  ( thus obeying Frege's principle of oomposi tionality  )   . To analyze an expression semantically means to determine the construction it expresses  . Ordinary language expressions have often more than one analysis  . 
The analyses of language expressions ( i . e . construct ~ , ions ) can be represented by ~- expressions . This represent at-ional language has the same expressive power  ( within the frame-work of TIL ) as the natural language , but has no ambiguities . 
The inference rules of TIT serve as a theoreti calfoundation for the inference necessary in knowledge representation  . 
The infinite hierarchy of types in TIL makes it possible to work with properties of p roperties or with relations between an ind ividual and a proposition in the same way as the first order theories work with relat ions between individuals  . Thus , TIL can be considered to be a limit case of the theories of order n  . 

As ~ stem for knowled Ke representation , based on TIL , is presently under develo ~ nent . Its knowledge base contains a special atom representing the system itself  , and certain proc-edures allow the system to determine the truth-value of propos-iti on s concerning its knowledge  ( this can be considered as a rudimentary form of self-reflection  )   . This feature allows the system to infer cor rect answers e  . g . in the following convers-ation , where x , y are variables for individuals and p is a variable for properties ! replies from the system are marked by > >>:  ( I ) John is a boy and Paul is a boy . >>> Hm . 
(2) Is Tomaboy ? > > > I don't know.
(3) If x is a boy then you know that x is a boy . >>> Hm . 
/,4) Is Tomaboy ? >>> No.
(5 ) x is omniscient with respeot top Iff ( if y instantiates p then x knows that y in s tantiates p  )   . 
>>> I-Ira .
(6 ) With respect to which property are you ommlscent ?>>> Boyhood  . 
Not_ . .ee : Before the start of the conversation , the system is in the initial state , where basic infer , no , rules have been programmed and grannnar and a dictionary have been introduced  . 
but n of actual knowledge . The dictionary entries contain in most cases only a word  , its class and the type of the object it denotes  . 
The self-referential o a pacit ~ is one of the strong feat-ures of natural language  ( thus allowing the linguist to describe the object of his study  )  . This capacity leads to the possibility of paradoxioal assertions  ( the Liars paradox-as far as a modification for artificial intelligence is concerned  , see Cherniav sky/2/ . Havel/3/) . In the following example , the system is ordered to believe a proposition ~8 )  . which is easily performed ~9) . Nevertheless , if the attempt to believe a proposition ( 12 )   , althou ~ lit is " known " to be true (11) . 
-70-(7) Tom says that the Earthis round . >>> Hm . 
(8 ) Belleve the proposition which Tom says \[>>> OK . 
(9 ) Which property does the Earth have ? > > > Roundness  . 
(10 ) Paul says that you do not believe the proposition which 
Paul says . >>> ~ hn ,   ( 11 ) Is the proposition which Paul says true ? >>> Yes . 
(12 ) Belleve the proposition which Paul says\[>>> Sorry I cannote Not_  . _~es In this example , to " believe " is interpreted in such a way that the system " believes " a proposition by actual storing its ~ e present at l on  . Thus , the positive answer to question ( 11 ) does not imply that the system " believes " the proposit-ion  . Diverse interpretations of " believe " are possible oThe " the " in  ( 8 )  , (10)-(12) is interpreted locally , i . e . in the context of the knowledge base of the system  . Thus , if the system knows only one of the propositions which Tom says  , then this proposition is th . .~e proposition which Tom sayse The problem of anal~sls of language expressions  ( i . e . 
of determining the constructions expressed by them  ) is not the main goal of our research , Nevertheless , a restricted sub-set of scientific Eng lish  ( see sentence ( 5 ) above ) has been described by a grammar , which is " almost SLR(O ) " .   ( The stack automaton accepting the l~u6uage has some states with shif~--reduce and/or reduce-reduce conflicts  .   ) The analyzer gives all possible analyses of the input sentence  , taking into account both the ambiguities of the syntactic structure of the sentence and the ambiguities of the individual words  . The second case is illustrated by the fol lowing example :  ( 13 ) John has a ball v ( 14 ) John has every good property which Paul has . 
(15) John has a brother,
The sentences can be rephrased as ( 13" ) John owns aball . 
- 71 - ( 14"  ) Johninetantiates every good property which Paul 
Instantlates.
(15" ) There is x such that x is a brother of John . 
The word " have " in ( 13 ) and ( 14 ) denotes the objects ( i . e . relations ) denoted by " own " and " instantiate " in ( 13" ) and ( 14" )  , respectively .   ( The relation in ( 15" ) is dlffloult to denote by a single word . ) Thus , the analyses of sentences ( 13 )  -  ( 15 ) are: ( 13- ) Aw . Some ~ x . And\[\[Ballw\]x\]?\[Ownw\]JohnX ( 14" ) ~ w . Every xp . Oond\[And\[Propertyp\] . And\[\[Goodw\]p\] . 
\[ Instantiate w\]P aulp\] . \[ Instant latew\]John p(15w)~w . Some ~ x . \[Brotherw\]x John Notes The information of the different analyses of " have " has % obe stored in the dictionary  . Here , to own is a relation between individuals , to instantiate is a relation between an individual and a property  , and in (15) and (15") , a relatio ~ between an individual and are lation is mentioned  ( since brotherhood is a relation between in d ividuals  )   . Thus , ambigui-ties of this sort may be resolved by examining  , whether the type of the denoted object " fit s " into the types of objects denoted by o ther words in the sentence  . 
The s~stem is be in ~ programmed in 7 . 7SP and the cur rent vers ion has some 2500 lines of source code . The quoted examp-les ( including the inference of answers ( 1 )  -  ( 12 )   ) have been processed by the system . 
The aim of the present paper is to demonstrate that TIL forms a suitable framework for a description of natural lan-guage semant ics  , since 1 ) the language of A-expressions is suffic iently rich but diesmbiguated  2  ) the translation of natural language express ions into these " se ~= utic  7  :~ ) resentations " is relatively straightfo rward-  72   -3  ) the inference necessary in language understandiP4? can be performed using the inference rules of TIL
