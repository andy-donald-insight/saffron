This paper presents an approach to deal with the underspecification of Aktionsarteni German sentences  . In German the difference between an accomplishment and the associated progressive state is often not marked on the sentence level  . This distinction is important for correctly interpreting texts and for translation into languages which provide morphological markings of Aktionsarten  . To maintain compositionality we suggest a two -step analysis of a text with respect othe temporal relations and the classification as events or states  . This analysis is guided by the Discourse Representation Theory developed by Kamp and makes use of world knowledge and an inference component  . 
The problem of classification can be reformulated as the problem of finding an embedding function f from the representational entities onto the domain of a model  . The models we use a restructures built from intervals of time  , events and individuals . Considering intensional models of this type will allow us to give truth-conditions for progressive states related to corresponding accomplishments  . We restrict ourselves to progressive states of intentional actions and use the beliefs of the agent  . 
1) Introduction:
The influence of the criterion " Aktionsart " with respecto the temporal relations of temporal entities often seems to be overemphasized  . On the one hand the correct dassift cation is a problem  , on the other hand , it seems that in more cases than assumed the influence of world knowledge is necessary to disambiguate he temporal relations  . 
In this paper an approach is preseuted based on a two-step anal ~ Ls of a text  . The first step consists in constructing a partial ordering on the basis of an approximate classification of the temporal units on sentence level  , using the framework of D ( is course ) R ( epresent at lon ) T ( heory ) /cf . Kamp 1981a/ . In the second step we try to obtain possible linear readings  , using background-information , provided by a database , and an inference component that . is an extended version of the " event-calculus " /c f  . Kowalski,Sergot/ . 
The subdivision into two steps enables the temporal resolution component to work without a great number of inferencing processes  . This contributes to a more modular-like structuring of the natural anguage processing -system  . The goal is to represent ambiguous readings as such  . 
The progressive state reading of an accomplishment leads to the problem called " imperfeetive paradox "  . Using the beliefs of the agent we try to give a solution for the subclass of intentional actions  . The problem here is to deal with the time dependency of the content of someone's belief  . 
1602) Partial Event-Structures
The starting point of this paper is the conviction  , following Kamp and others , that within the temporal units , events are primordial , and time is abstracted from them . The construction of pure temporal units can be based on the ultra-filter-construction ntroduced by Wiener/cf  . Kamp 1979 , 1981b , van Benthem /: In order to model the natural underspecification fhuman perception  , only the relations < , o ( temporally smaller or overlap ) are given within the event-structures in/Kamp 1979/along with the following axioms :
A1 Vel , e2eI < c2->~e2 < e1
A2Vel , e2e1 < e2& e2 < e3-> eI < e3
A3Vel , e2elee2-> e2 oe1
A4 Ve1e Ioe1
A5 Vel , e2 eI < e2 - ~. ~ elee 2
A6 Vel , e2 , e3 , e4 el < e2 & e2 oe 3& e3 < e4 -> e1 < e4
Including the axiom of linearity
A7 Vel , e2 el < e2 ; elee 2 ; e 2< eIother relations llke " subset " or " temporal equivalence " can be defined out of these basic relations  . This shows the fundamental significance of the relations < and o  . 
The addition of new events can allow a more accurate statement o ~ the temporal relations  . If we start with an uttered relation of vague simultaneity between two events eI and e  2 expressed by e 1 o % and if it becomes clear from later passages of the text that there are events e  3 and e 4 with e 3 < e 2 < e 4 and e 3 oe 1 and e 4 oe 1 we can deduce by the Wiener construction , that the event et , seen as punctual at the beginning , consists of at least three moments of time t l , t2 , tyThus the internal structure of such events can become more elaborate as the text proceeds  . In addition we can specify with greater precision the relation between events  . In the case of eI and e 2 we are now able to conclude , that the overlap of the beginning has to be understood as a subset-relation between  e2 and e 1  . 
In the following we will make use of this conception within the definition of our models for representations of texts  . 
The Akfionsarten , redefined by Vandler , have frequently served as criterion to correctly constructlme-structures from natural anguage -texts  . /cf . Dowty 1986, Hiurichs , Partcc/ . 
The opinion is not tenable however that telic events  ( accomplishments , achievements ) , in the absence of temporal adverbials , hift the reference time for new temporal units forward  , and that activities , or socalled at elic events , and states do not . This is often argued in the literature . 
Exampte 1: ( eO ) John I , ~ rote a program . ( e1) Itetogged in ,   ( ez ) opened his file and ( e3 ) began writing and correcting by using his papers . 
Examp Le 2: ( eO ) Yesterday a tot of things happened . 
( e1) John boughtabicycte , ( e2) Mary den ~ tished Stantey's microw ave oven . 
In example 1, el , . . . , e3 are internally ordered subevents of e0 . In example 2 , no obvious ordering between eI and e2 exists . 
Without infereneing and using a detailed analysis of discourse fimctions as " continuatiol f ' or " elaboration " we cannot establish the right ordering relations for=:uch cases  . 
It isewm harder to state correctly temporal relations within a compositions t approach : 
Exar % t ~\[ e3: ( eO ) John took the ptane to Frankfurt . 
( e1) Then he took the train to Stuttgart.
(s 1 ) A she ' d had nothing to eat since breakfast ( e2 ) he boughtes and t~ie hat the station . 
e )( e \]) Then he bordered the train.
b )   ( e3 ) Then he 19aoned his uife to say that he = d arrived , ( e4) beforetsking the tramhorle . 
Only when p , ' ocessing the fourth sentence of example 3 ( lowed is cover that e 2 is an elaboration of e 1 in the case of a )  , whereas in b ) e2 is a continuation ~) f e1 . 
Thus what we should do in the first step of the analysis is to construct an underspecified ordering hoping that in the second step  , on the basis of the representation * of the whole text  , we can refine the conditions . We restrict ourselves to cases as in example 1 and 3  , be can schere it suffices that one reference point is provided by the representation f the preceding text  . 
To repret ; ent the ambiguity between continuation and elaboration we need a relation " not-before "  . However to define " not-before " as a transitive relation the disjunction of < and o  ( <  ; o ) is not sufficient . This becomes clear from e : mmples 1 and 3 which would then be expressed by the following : %0   ( < ; o ) e1(< ; o ) e2(< ; o ) e3"(e3 not-before 2 not-before l . . . ) Because o is not transitive , for an admitted reading " e0 oe 1 oe 2 oe 3" ( which would be true in cases where e 1 is a subevent of Co , exa subevent of e1 and so on ) one cannot exclude the possibility that " e 3 < el " , which is surely not the case for such episodic readings  . 
Exempte 4: e3--e2e1
Thus we have to require :
Vel , e2(e2 not-before1 <-> el < e2 ; ( elee2a ( Veses < e1->e3<%))) . 
This suffices for transitivity as easily can be shown  . 
Nevertheless we intend to tackle the problem in a second way  ; first because we want to be able to state a relation of isomorphy between event structures and Allen's interval structures/cf  . Allen / , and second , because we want to make use of the eveut calculus of Kowalski and Sergot within our inference component  . In their approach events are fike points . To this end we need extensions of pure event structures  . 
It has been proposed , by Moens and Steedman among others/cf . Moens , Steedman / , partly with the intention of making Kowalski and Sergot's event calculus available for natural language systems  , to represent the extent of structured events , i . e . accomplishments and activities , thereby conceding them starting and final events Cstart-events " and " stop"-or " culminafion -events "  )  . This method is also adopted within our approach . 
In combination with the Wiener method of constructing pure time units  , this finer granulation allows us to conceive the o-relation as art equivalence relation for socalled secondary events  , which , as we will see , is another way of solving the problem of " not -before"  . 
The model for DRS's used here is an extended version of the point-event-structure model with a domain of individuals proposed by Kamp  . 
The version in this paper is a continuation of the modclin/Reylc /  . 
An extended point-event sructure with a domain of individual si given by : < E  , ' l ; , d , U , & b ,  < , o , start , end , F , G > where I he following is the case : * Eistile set of events and is subdivided into primary and secondary events : Primer  , See ev . 
* Primer is subdivided into Acc ( accomplishments )  , Act ( activities ) and
Ach ( achievements).
* start , end are partial functions over the primary events with values in the domain of the secondary events such that each element of this domain is a value of one of these fimctions  . 
* Secev is subdivided into the subclasses Start ( start-event )  , Stop ( stop-event ) and ( htl ( culmination-event )  . 
*S is the set of states.
* P ( T ) stands for the set of periods which can be formed from the elements in T  , which is the set of atomic , purely temporal units , whereby * T contains all atomic elements which arc constructed out of E and Sthrough the Wiener constrnction  . 
* disa (< , o ) - homomorphism , which relates the events in E and the states in S to the corresponding purely temporal entities in P  ( T )  . 
*// is the set of individuals * The following holds : every accomplishment x is assigned exactly one start-event xI and either one stop -event x  2 or one cul-event x2  , every activity x is assigned exactly one start -event xI and one stop-event ~  , every achievement x is assigned exactly one cul -event  x2  , whereby tile assignment of secondary events to primary events  , in combination with conditions about the relations <  , o can be graphically illustrated as follows : x x  6 Acc , or x6Act : .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   . 
xIx2tx1 < x2 & x1 ox & x2 ox & ( VyEEUSUP ( 7" )   ( y < x ~ -> y < Xl )  &  ( x < y <-> x2 < y )   )   ) ? EAch: .   .   .   . 
xZ ( x2ox & ( VyEEUSUP ( T )   ( x < y <-> x2 < y )   )   ) * The secondary events are considered as atomic : VxE Secev  , y , z ~ EUSUP ( T )  : ~ ( yox & zox & y<z ) The axioms A1-A6 , extended to all temporal units of the domain , hold for the relations < , o , such that it follows that , with the inclusion of the linearity axiom :
A7 Vx , y EEUs UP(T ) : ( x < y ; xoy ; y < x ) o has the characteristic of being an equivalence relation  , restricted to the secondary events . 
One can thus define :
Vx , yESecev:x = py <-> xoy
This allows the abbreviation " x < py " for elements of Secev with " x < y " x = py "  . 
*/7 , G are interpretation functions , such that F assigns every nary relation Ra function over P  ( T )  , which assigns ever yiEP ( T ) a subset of UnG assigns everyn ~ ary relation R a set of n+l-tupels out of ExUn * b is a function which assigns in a one-to-one-correspondence very states ES a pair < i  , <R , Ul , , . .,un > > with < ul, . . . ,Un > ~ F(R)(i ) * In addition , the following correlation principle should hold : For every nary verb R and every n+l-tupel < e  , ul ,  . . . ,Un > E G ( R ) there exists a states ES and an intervali EP ( T ) such that b ( s ) = < i , <R' , ul ,  . . . ,Un > > and either " i c d(e )" or " i < d(e )" , whereby R ' represent she progressive variant ProgR of R  . 
On the other hand , there should exist for every R ' , which is the progressive variant of an R and which is assigned ans by b  , an n+l-tupel EG ( R ) with the corresponding ordering and individual relations  . 
In the system proposed here , a narrative text without any additional specifications which includes a series of events eIEAcc  , e2EAch , e 3 EAcc would be assigned the following semantic representation : end  ( e1 ) /<// < p < p < start ( el )   .   .   .   .   .   .   . end(e2) .   .   .   .   .   . start ( e3) end(e3) Thus , the underspecification which is necessary in example such as  1 and 3 is maintained without heside-effect of example 4  . 
More exact relations can be established in a second step  , using pragmatic knowledge , which completes the structure . In the case of example 2 we assume an indicing which does not allow an internal ordering  . 
An advantage of this representation , using secondary events , for underspecified texts , over a representation with differentiated ordering relations  , such as Allen's interval structures/eft . lien / , is , for example , its notational efficiency : If el , e2EAce , then the following holds : start ( el ) < p start ( e2 ) is equivalent to  e1 ( =  ; <  ; o ; s ; siBdi ; fi)e2
VeEAch , e2E Secev : end ( e ) = e2-> ( VyEEUs UP ( T ) : y < e2 <-> y < e ) one can show easily that within the event substructure of the extended point-event structure the relations that Allen uses can be defined in terms of o and < such that a relation of isomorphy holds between such extended event structures and Allen's interval structures  .   ( In general this is not the case for the original event structures  )  .  1 3 ) The imperfect lvep aradox and the ambiguity of the Aktionsarten in 

No attempts to solve the paradox that I an ~ familiar with have been able to reduce the validity of a sentence in the progressive form to the validity of the same sentence without a progressive  , which was the intent . 2 Moens and Steedman , with their aspectual net , have proposed a solution in which progressives are only generated from the activity readings of events  . I will adopt this view to a certain extent , but will take it one step further , by bringing in beliefs , in order to create the possibility of reestablishing a direct relation at least for some kinds of accomplishments  . 
The basic idea is that it is often only on the level of a text that the hearer can decide whether or not the culmination of an accomplishment  , which has been introduced by a progressive , has actually been reached . Some texts will leave this decision open , others will force the existence of a culmination , and still others will force ihen on existence of a culmination  . 
Especially in this last case , it is necessary to question the justification of the use of the progressive state for an accomplishment : how do we know the goal of an action if it is not attained ? These possible characteristics of a text should be reflected by the different possibilities of assigning an embedding function relative to a DRS in a model M  . 
We therefore require for a function f , which maps discourse referents of a DRSK onto entities in an expanded point-event sructure with a domain of individuals  , in addition to the usual features/eLReyle / , the following : MI =  f , K start ( e ) < end ( e ) iff start M ( f ( e ) ) < M endM ( f ( e ) ) and either endM ( f ( e ) ) E Stop M or endM ( f ( e ) ) E Cul M In addition the DRS construction algorithmust contain the rule : For alle E Ace  , e ' EEUSUP ( T ) : end ( e ) < p e '-> end ( e ) ~ Cnl If one requires , as in the correlation principle , that every state introduced by the progressive of an accomplishment verb be contained by an event  , then the question whether e has a culmination ( that is , represents a true accomplishment ) or just as top-point ( that is , corresponds to the activity reading of an accomplishment  )  , is transformed into the question of the existence of the corresponding f  . 
Compat ~ to this end the analogous approach in /Schulz /  . In a subsequent paper we want to generalize the result with respect to the whole temporal substructure of an extended point-event structure  .

On the other hand , the question whether a corresponding expression in German is to bcread as the progressive of an accomplishment or as a real accomplishment will not necessarily be decided on tia e sentence level  . We enter start ( e ) < end ( e ) and make the interpretation of end ( e ) depend on the possibility oi ? finding an embedding ftmction f  ,

Ioct end(e3) , h , in ( street )) io c(end(e4) , h , in ( street )) term ( e4 , exists(h )) true ( end(el ) , exists ( h ) ) On the basis of these facts one can conclude that no linear ordering of the secondary events can exist if end  ( el ) CC ull mlds . Therefore we make use of an extended version of the event-calculus by introducing for each finear reading which is to be tested " auxiliary " events to get endpoints for the introduced states if needed  . If such events contradict with respectory an assumption wtf id ~ one could call the relevance-principle  , the proposed linear reading is rejected . This relevance-principle for instance would predict that in a story in which the agent crosses the street but is nevertheless later located in the street  , an event of reentering the street should be mentioned  . 
Tiros , every embedding function f , on the basis of the appropriate axioms , must map end(ca ) onto an element from Stop M . eI is interpreted as a nonreal accomplishment and this part of the text is no longer ambignous  . When translating this representation i to a natural language  , the corresponding state-marker and not the corresponding twent-marker must be considered  3  .

4) luteusionul model of a DRS
Although the correlation principle implies a relation between a sentence wilh tire progressive form and the same sentence without  , it also makes dependent on f the question of whether the corresponding event to a progressive form of an accomplishment can be read as a real accomplishment or not  . 
If not , one must ask according to which criteria the special determinability of assertions about accomplishments is justified  , since without the possibility of checking the result  , the descriptions of progressives such as :
Exampte 6: a ) " Hansward a bei auf dongerggipfelzukLettern " b  ) " lions ~ al ' dabei auf die Iluette unterhaib des Gipfels zuklettern  . " , in case the corrcs pondiug events are not completed  , collapse into the description of a perception of an activity : " Hansklctterte "  . 
What are the criteria for considering one state to be fulfilled at time t and the other not ? It seems tome that one possibility of cwth tating such cases could consist in referring to beliefs  . Thcrc is no doubt that not all accomplishments in wl veagency  , and even in the case of agency there is not always in t cn tionality by the agent  ( cf . Dowty's nolion of " controllahility ") . But on th cone hand intentionality and associated activity can serve as a sufficient condition for the validity of a progressive state  . 
On the other hand , in other cases , the introduction of beliefs can serve to represent expectations of the speaker or mentioned protagonists connected to tire introduction of such progressive states  . Thus we get at least a further instrument to represent ambiguous readings  . Our aim is uot to provide the correct truth -conditions for nonintent kmal cases  . Here further research is needed . Wc restrict ourselves to the description of cases as in example  6 and we will concentrate on the notion of belief in a framework where time comes into play  . 
For cases as in example 6 we require that : " Hansist dabei at tf den Berggip felzuk letter n " be true att if an activity e of climbing by Hans in the direction of the peak exists where tce  . 
and if I qans has the intention of climbing the motmtain at t  , i . e . in the " belief state " of llaus att there exists an  ( : ventewl fich he wants to accomplish .

For the interpretation fsuch DRS's it is useful to expand the concept of a DRS model  . Extending the model of/Asher / , we define : Intensional point-event sructure with a domain of individuals : < w  , n , // / cc / /// r >
The following holds : * W is a set of worlds*D = U ( Dw : WEW ) * Dw = << E , T , d , U ,  < , o , start , end , S , b>w , K , K' , K "> For every wEW < E , T , d , U ,  < , o , start , end , S , b > w is a point-event sructure with a domain of individuals and the corresponding conditions  . 
K is a set of DRSs.
K ' is a set of " delineated " DRSs.
K " is a set of " predicative " DRSs.
( For our porposes K'is of interest . K and K " m'e mentioned only for the sake of completeness  )  .

Since the beliefs of the agent can change within the considered time-interval we require that the value of p be a set of structures  , kr'\[1< r'_<m . For the description of the belief-K 0 -to be true it is necessary that there is a proper portion-k  2' -that all the different belief-states have in common  . One part of that portion-k 3' -should be described by K 0  . We state that the description of the belief-K 0 - is correct when the set of possible worlds in which the corresponding part of the portion-k  3' - is true is contained in the set of possible worlds in which the description is true  . The treatment of " internal anchors " remains to be integrated  . 
For a more detailed review compare the basic model in lasher ~  , where , in particular , the function H is defmed along with the remaining truth conditions  . 
5. Conclusion:
The system considered here allows a solely partial ordering of events antistates on the representational level  , which can be completed on the basis of world knowledge stored in a database  , with respect to the ordering and the dassifl cationi to Aktion sarteu  . The compositionality principle for the construction of a semantic representation can thereby be maintained  . 
Ambiguous readings are kept as such , impossible readings are rejected . 
The expansion to an intensional model for DRS's not only would permit in a certain way the restatement of the relation between some kinds of accomplishments and the corresponding progressive states  , but it also would allow , through the use of the belief predicate , an extended version of the theory to correctly represent ambiguities such as is made clear in the following examples through the use of different indices  .
