Abstract
This paper describes the syntactic rules which are applied in the Japanese speech recognition module of a speech-to-speech translation system  . Japanese is considered to be a free word/phrase order language  . 
Since syntactic rules are applied as constraints to reduce the search space in speech recognition  , applying rules which take into account all possible phrase orders can have almost the same effect as using no constraints  . Instead , we take into consideration the recognition weaknesses of certain syntactic ategories and treat them precisely  , so that a miuimal number of rules can work most effectively  . In this paper we first examine which syntactic a tegories are easily misrecognized  . Second , we consult our dialogue corpus , in order to provide the rules with great generality  . Based ou both stndies , we refine the rules . Finally , we verify the validity of the refinement through speech recognition experiments  . 
1 Introduction
We are developing the Spoken
Language Tl ~ ANSlation system ( SL-TRANS)\[1\] , in which both speech recognition processing and natural language processing arc integrated  . Currently we are studying automatic speech translation from Japanese into English in the domain of dialogues with the reception service of an international conference office  . 
In this framework we are constructing syntactic rules for recognition of Japanese speech  . 
In speech recognition , the most significant concern is raising the recognition accuracy  . For that purpose , applying linguistic information turns out to be promising  . Various approaches have been taken , such as using stochastic models\[2\] , syntactic rules\[3\] , semantic information\[4\] and discourse plans\[5\]  . Among stochastic models , the bigram and trigram succeeded in achieving a high recognition accuracy in languages that have a strong tendency toward a standard word order  , such as English . On the contrary , Japanese belongs to free word order languages\[6\]  . For such a language , semantic information is more adequate a . s a constraint . However , building semantic on-straints for a large vocabulary needs a tremendous amount of data  . Currently , our data consist of dialogues between the conference registration office and prospective conference participants with approximately  199  , 0 00 words in telephone conversations and approximately  72  , 000 words in keyboard conversations . But our data are still not sufficien to build appropriate semantic on straints for sentences with  700 distinct words . Processing a discourse plan requires excessive calculation and the study of discourse itself must be further developed to be applicable to speech recognition  . On the other hand , syntax has been studied in more detail and makes increasing the vocabulary easier  . 
As we are working on spoken language , we try to reflect real language usage . For this purpose , a stochas-tic approach beyond trigrams , namely stochastic sentence parsing \[7\] , seems most promising . Ideally , syntactic rules should be generated automatically from a large dialogue corpus and probabilities should also be automatically assigned to each node  . But to do so , we need underlying rules . Moreover , coping with phoneme perplexity , which is crucial to speech recognition , with rules created frmn a dialogue corpus , requires additional research\[8\] . 
In this paper we propose taking into accountile weaknesses of the speech recognit on system in the earliest stage  , namely when we construct underlying syntactic rules  . First , we examined the speech recognition results to determine which Syntactic ategories tend to be recognized erroneously  . Second , we utilized our dialogue corpus\[9\] to support he refinement of rules concerning those categories  . As examples , we discuss formal nouns 1 and conjunctive postposi ~ ions 2  . 
Finally , we carried out a speech recognition experiment with the refined rules to verify the validity of our approach  .

Recognition in the Japanese speech recognition module of our experimental system the combination of generalized I  , R parsing and fIidden Markov Model ( IIMM ) is realized ~ sIIMM-LR\[10\] . The system predicts phonetnes by using an LR parsing table and drives IIMM phoneme verifiers to detect/verify them without any intervening structure  , such as a phoneme lattice . 
The speech recognition unit is a Japanese bun -selsu  , which roughly corresponds to a phrase and is the next largest unit after the word  . The ending of the bunsels u ( phrase ) is usually marked by a breathpoint . This justities its treatment as a distinct unit . 
A Japanese phrase consists of one independent word  ( e . g . noun , adverb , verb ) and zero , one or more than one dependent words ( e . g . postposition , auxiliary verb ) . Then mnber of words in a phreLse ranges from 1 to 14  , and the mean number is about 3 , according to our dialogue corpus . 
We will clarify the weaknesses of HMM-Llt speech recognition both in phrases and in sentences  . 
2.1 Phrase Recognition Errors
We examined which syntactic ategoriest mtd to be erroneously recognized  , when using IIMM-LR pltraa espeech recognition . For this purl ) ose , we applied syntactic rules containing no constraints on word sequences s  . This me , mstll at any word can follow any word . 
Examples ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) show the resnlts of IIMM-LH Japanese speech recognition " l  . Then ttered phoneme strings are enclosed in II .

In (1) , after recognizing the tirst word , the system selected subsequent words solely to produce a phoneme string similar to the original utterance  . 
(2 ) is an example of phrase recognition which failed . 
In this example to u was erroneously recognized as to  . 
Suhsequently , no fllrther correet words were selected . 
Examples ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) both show that IIMM-LR tends to select words consisting of extremely few phonemes when it fails in word recognition  . To avoid this problem , precise rules should be written fin'sequences of words with small n nmbers of phonemes  . In Japmmse , postpositions ( e . g , ga , o , nit , wh-pronoui is ( e . g , itsu , nani , claret\[Ill , numerals ( e . g .

2  . 2 Sentence il . ecognition Errors To exanfine the error tendency of sentence speech recognition we applied a two-step  method\[12\]  . First , we applied phra~e rules to the It MM-LR speech recognitions  . Second , we applied phrase-ba-sed sentence rules tt , the phrase candidates as a post-filter , in order to obtain sentence candidates , while filter-insout unacceptable candidates . We experimented with the 353 phrases making up 1:/7 sentences . The recognition rate ff ) r the top candidates w in s 68 . 3% by exact string t natching , and for the top5 candidates 95 . 5 % . 
Based on the top 5 phr ~ me candidates , we con-dncteda ; ; entent experiment , ht this experiment we applied loosely constrained sentence rules  . With these rules , alt proxinnt tely 80% of all the pos-sibh ' , combinations of phrase candidates were re- .

6 a : gozyuu sho-tona mae-oon engai- . sh?-masu-shi Though the phoneme string in 3a is different from the uttered phoneme string , the difference between no and N in meaning is minor  , and has no effect on translation with the current echnique  . While (3) is affirmative , 3 b is interrogative , which is indicated by the sentence final postposition ka  . This cannot be treated with sentence rules . To haudle this problem , we need dialogue management . 
The uttered phrase kochira-~a in (4) , meaning " this , " was recognized erroneously ask at . a-wain4a , meaning " person . " The word kata belongs to the formal noun group , a kind of noun which should be modified by a verbal phrase  \[13\]  . Sentence 4a is acceptable , if modified by a verbal phrase , as in 4a  ':  4a ': midori-nosei hukn-okiteiru kata-wa kaigizim ukyoku-desu  ( The person who is wearing agreen uniform is \[ with \] the conference office  . ) This is also true of the phrase mono in 5c meaning " thing , " which was erroneously recognized instead of doumo meaning " very much ":  5c ': kouka-na monoaring at-ou-go zaima-shi-ta ( Thank you for the expensive thing . ) In sentence candidates 5a and 5b , the numer algo , meaning " five , " is used . These sentences may seem strange at first glance , but in a situation such as playing cards , these sentences are quite natural . If someone plays a 5 when you need one , you would say : " Thanks for the five . " Similarly , when you need a 3 and a 5 , and someone plays a 3 and after that someone else plays a 5  , you would say : " Thanks for the five , too . " In the sentence candidate 6a , the conjune tive-posl posilion ( conj-pp ) shi is used sentence finally . In principle , a conj ~ pp combines two sentences , functioning like a conjunction , such as " while " and " though , " and is used in the middle of a sentence . 
Erroneou sentence recognition such as in the case of  3ab cannot be treated by sentence rules . Therefore , we are trying to cope with erroneous recognition , as seen in sentence candidates 4a , 5a-c and 6a , with sentence rules . 
3 Dealing with Speech Recognition Er rors We are going to deal with sentences containing tile following phrases : ? Phrases with formal nouns ? Phrases with numerals ? Phrases with conj-pps used in the sentence final position In order to decide how to cope with the above problems  , we used our dialogue corpus . Currently we have 177 keyboard conversations consisting of approximately  72  , 0 00 words and 181 telephone conversations consisting of approxilnately  199  , 000 words 7 . 
We regard keyboard conversations as representing written Japanese and telephone conversations a representing spoken Japanese  . When retrieving the dialogue corpus , we always compare written and spoken Japanese , in order to clarify the features of the latter . 
We examined the actuM usage of formal nouns as well as that of e o n j-p p s  . 
3.1 Formal Nouns
We examined the behavior of formal nouns , such as ko to and mono . Formal nouns are considered to be a kind of noun which lacks the content usually found in common nouns such as " sky " or " apple  . " They function similarly to relative pronouns and therefore are used with a verbal  modifier\[13\]  , as in examples 7 and 8:   7 : kinouiliako to ~ watorikeshitai . 
(I would like to take back what I said yesterday . )  8 : nedan-gatakai mono-gas hitsu-gaii wake de -wanai  . 
(It is not always true that an expensive thing has good quality  . ) In examples 7 and S , the formal nouns , kolo and mono , are modified by k in ouilia ( yesterday said ) and nedan-gatakai ( price expensive )  , respectively . But it is also true that these nouns behave like common nouns and can be used without any verbal modifier  , as in examples 9 and 10:9: sore-wako to desune . 
7The dialogue corpus is ? . rowing constantly . When we retrieved form M nouns , we had 113 keyboard conversations and 96 telephone conversations .

( This stuff is trustworthy.)
Considering the examples 710 , we coukl define two kinds of usage for formal nouns  . This distinction is applicable to sentence analysis  , but is meaningless from the standpoint of applying syntactic rules ms constraints  . 
3.1.1 Formal Nouns in the Corpus
Illour dialogue corpus , ko to , mono , hou and kata are tile most frequently used formal nouns  . Table 1 shows how oftentile formal nouns are used with a verbal modifier  . We have also rctrieved formal nouns used in the sentence initial position  , w ~ in example 10 .

Without Verb . Mod.

Total 2143
Table 1 indicates that tile coverage reaches 63 % in written Japanese , when we allow only formal nouns preceded by a verbal modifier in the syntactic rules  . 
l lowever , the coverage remains at 40% , which is less than half , in the spoken Japanese we are dealing with . 
We have further examined those sentences in which for tnal nouns are not modified by verbals  . Most of them are modified by phrases consisting of a noun and postposition o  , which approximately corresponds to " of . " Further , some are modified by phrases cousist ~ ing of a verb t bllowed by postpositions to and no  . 
Others are moditled by words which cars be used exclusively  , as nominal modifier such as donna ( what kind of ) and so no ( that )  . We found only one exam-pie in the keyboard conversation i which a fortnal noun is not modified at all :  11 : osoraknkyouju-nikoto-noshidm-otsuta erukoto -gaii-toomoim ~ su  . 
(it might be good if you tell the professor how the tiring is going  . ) In our di Mogue corpus we found 2 , 491 phrases containing the formal nouns kolo , mono , hou and kala . 
Out of 2 , 491 examples , there is only one which is not modified at all . If we define formall souns , ~s those which are always modilied in some manner  , i . e . even if we do not allow formal nouns to be used alone  , the coverage still exceeds 99% . Since the occurrence rate of formal nmms without ally moditier is very low  , we can treat the usage of formal nouns ( as in examples 911 ) as semi-frozen expressions . 
3.2 Conjunctive Postpositions
Japanese pc , st positions such m ~9 a , o and h i , which function a . scase markers , are usually attached to nominals . Different from this kind of postposition , conj-ppsucha ~ sga , te and ba are used after verb Ms . 
Conj-pps combine two clauses , fimctiouing similarly to conjunctions such as " because " and " whilc  , " and are thus often used in the middle of a sentence  , as in example 12 . But they carsal so be used in the sentence final position  , as illexmnple13 .

There should follow some additional words to express the complete meaning  . Sentences finishing with a eonj-pple ave the interpretation to tile hearer  . And , in general , the hearer can correctly interpret the sentence from the context  . Understanding conj-pps , therefore , plays an important role in treating spoken

Table 2 shows conj-pps used sentence finally.
According to Table 2 , the conj-ppga is the one most used in keyboard conversations  . While the usage of conj-pps in keyboard conversations is heavily concentrated ong a with all occurrence rate of  85%  , it is more balanced m telephone conversations . In addition to ga (38%) , kcredomo ( 30% ) and conj-pps which carry a similar meaning such asker c do  , kedo and ke domo are frequently used . In telephone conversations , node (13%) is also frequently nsed . Treating only the six conj-pps in sentence final position  , the coverage reaches 91% for Sl ) oken Japanese . l ) it t ~ ren ~ ti at mg conj-pps which can I reused in sentence final position i ? om those which can be used only in the middle of a sentence is also supported by the speech recognition  results\[14\]  .

rioestimate the latter we checked how many sentence candidates were fltered out by applying phrmse-based sentence rules as a post-filter  . We verified the rule refinements through coral ) arisen of results gained by five different rule sets : tile refined version of sentence rules which contain all three relinements  ( Neu Grammar )  ; the refined versiou without conj-pp treatment ( No Sentence Final Conj-pp )  , without formal noun treatment ( No Formal ~ oun Treating )   , and without mnneral tr cat mcnt ( No Nume ~' alTz'eat?ng )  ; and rules which allow all combinations of phr ~ q e candidates  ( No (  ; rmmn~n :) . For the frst four of these rulesets wc determined ranks based on the probabilities of phoneme strings predicted by syntactic rules  . But in the No Grmam arcase we determined tile rank solely based on phoneme probability  . 
We exl ) erimented with the same 353 phrases which make up 137 sentences asirl section 2  . 2 . The phrase recognition rate for the top 5 candidates was again 95  . 5% by exact string matching . 
4.1 Speech Recognition Accuracy
We conducted speech recognition experiments . Figure 1 shows the constraint effectiveness of the phrmse -based sentence rules given the five conditions examined  .

Figure 2: Acceptance Rate 5 Conclusion We have described phrasebased syntactic rules which are used as constraints in the Japanese speech recognition module of our experimental speech-to-speech translation system  . For constructing rules we took into account he error tendency in speech recognition  . 
We treated precisely those syntactic ategories which tend to be recognized erroneously  . To increase the efficacy of each rule , the rule construction is strongly motivated by our dialogue corpus  . By applying the refined phrasebased syntactic rules  , the speech recognition rate for the top candidates improved from  37  . 2% to 70 . 1% and for the top5 candidates from 73 . 7% to 83 . 9 % . 
The implementation fsyntactic rules bascd on our dialogue corpus is continuing in order to increase coverage  . Currently we are studying postposition deletion in nominal phrases  , which is one of the features of spoken Japanese . When adding rules and enlarging vocabulary , we cammt avoid decreasing speech recognition accuracy  , but our further experiments showed that careful rule construction filtered out unacceptable sentence candidates much more effectively  . 
Though we believe that our dialogue corpus for the  , current domain provides enough expressions of spoken Japanese  , we are going to apply the same method to other domains to establish the generality of the rules  .
