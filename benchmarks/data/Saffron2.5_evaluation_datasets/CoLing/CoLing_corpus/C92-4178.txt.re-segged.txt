There may be more true statements than those that can be proved  . However , this seems to be a correct property for a system modelling natural language : Ordinarily  , we only express relevant facts -- not all true facts  .

Aspectual classes will be translated by simple formulas talking about times  ( intervals , points or unspecified with regard to this dist inction  ) or conjunctions or disjunctions of these . 
The other mechanisms will be described by implications  . The formulas on both sides refer directly to the aspectual classes instead of their respective translations  , enabling us to express significant generalizations  . 
Let us make some remarks on the intended meaning of the logical connectives  . OR ( V ) links different properties of an object .

It will be the role of other constituents in the text to select the intended reading  . However , that selection is not compulsive , which means that OR represents linguistic vagueness  . 
Example : An acquisition ( see below ) like remember may be used in an inehoative reading  ( - ~ cometomy mind ~" After some time , Irem emberedit ") , or in a stative reading (= beinmy mind , " ~ I still remember it " . But none is enforced in U Deadmen do not remember  ~  .

Abstract
This paper focuses on a theory of tense and aspect  ( the representation f time in natural anguage ) that attempts a form M representation f the relevant lilt-guistic devices a simplication rules in first order logic  . 
It presents a rich ontology as far as verb aspect is concerned  , distinguishing between complex patterns and vagueness  . 
Examples and conclusions are drawn from tile comparison between English and Portuguese  , pinpointing the importance of contrastive studies both for the understanding and for the evaluation of a general theory of tense and aspect  . 
In the paper , we present the actual translations of a wide range of phenomena  , and a short example . 
1 Introduction
The method we propose to represent and reason with tense and aspect  ( T&A ) in natural language has several distinguished features : It is both used in the building of the semantic representation of natural language text  , and in the inferences allowed from what was actually said  . There is therefore no conceptual separation between parsing and reasoning  . 
It is based on a two-step translation into first -order predicate calculus  , that allows us to use standard logic while preserving certain generalizations  , i . e . , some ( sets of ) patterns of temporal relations are identified as lexicalizing an aspectual class  , and T&A mechanisms are expressed in terms of the latter  . 
Grammatical mechanisms are translated into simple implications  . On one hand , they restrict/identify the set of situations they can apply to  , while they may also introduce lexical information of their own  . This second property allows for an elegant treatment of redundancy  , in addition to an obvious explanation for their standalone occurrence  ( cf . begin or just ) . 
Being proof-theoretical , the meaning of a sentence or text is what can be proved  . If other information is brought to focus but not proved  , it ACTeSnECOLING-92 , NANTES , 2328 hot3"r19921I32 PROC . OI:COLING-92, NANTES , AUG . 2328, 1992 may ) . The several properties conjoined are related for each actual occurrence  ; they are several faces of the same situation ; and no vaguenessi at stake . AND links the several ways people may choose to present a given situation  ( called viewpoint aspect in\[12\[ )  . 
Example : An accomplishment like build may be used in a durative description  ( " He was building its lowly " )  , or in a resultative description ( " He built it in two years ' ) ~ referring nevertheless to the same event . Or , in an achievement like leave , the period when a person is leaving surrounds the moment of leaving  . 
The lefthand side of an implication represents he conditions which are required to the felicitous use of the mechanism  . In case not all information is available , it may provide the sort of defeasible information that can be seen as the type coercion proposed in  \[81   . 
A sentence has a meaning iff there is at lea~t one derivation including all components  . If there is more than one , the alternatives will stand in an OR relation , and one will probably be selected by the following co-text  . 
Example : " He was attending a course on seman.
tics " could mean ~ he would " at a future time point relative to the past in question  , or that he was actually attending it . 
Syntax defines what are the possible arguments to the operators  , thus driving inference and disallowing certain combinations  . One way to model this fact is to allow syntactic structure itself to introduce axioms or metaaxioms  , restricting inference order . We stick to compositionality , but assign a nontrivial meaning to syntactic structure  , contrarily to e . g .  \[1\] . 
The method thus reduces to applying simple resolution to get al possible derived information  , and possibly get rid of different interpretations . 
The set of all asserted formulas in the system is what it can understand  . 
We will now argue for this method's adequacy to handle natural anguage tense and aspect systems by presenting linguistic motivation from two different languages  ( English and Portuguese )  , see\[10\] for more detail . At the same time , we give novel treatments of wellknown phenomena . 
These two points , we think , should be considered independently . That is , one can accept the general calculus yet proposing totally different rans-lations  , or on the contrary , import our linguistic solutions into a distinct framework  . 
2.1 Aspectual classes
Aspectual classes indicate the temporal constituency of the situation they describe  . They range from states ( without any restrictions whatsoever , or better , with no internal temporal dimension ) to accomplishments or achievements that include a complex temporal pattern in their lexical IT leaning  . They can ~ moreover , represent vague concepts that materialize in different temporal patterns  , with some common core meaning , as was described above . 
Our ontology is based solely in temporal properties  , thus cause or agentivity are considered separate information  , contrary to the overwhelming majority of aspectual classifications  ( cf . the overview in \[14\]) . 
In the figure next page , T represents an unspecified temporal object , which can denote either an interval , I , or a timepoint , t . We define three ' basic'classes , corresponding to three irreducible temporal patterns  , and then five others in terms of the former , with some additional " low-level " conditions , linking the temporal variables among the elementary intervening aspectual class definitions  . The sole reason why we did not define other combinations is that we did not find  , in the languages studied , examples of lexical items that covered such complex patterns  . 
For a more detailed exposition of the classes and objective criteria for distinguishing between them in Portuguese  , see\[11\] . Still , some remarks are in order here : 1 . We distinguish between changes and achievements since elements of the first class cannot be amplified in time  , that is , they have to be punctual , like notice or discover , while the others also involve some encompassing time connected to them : leave  , die , open . This shows in the acceptance of the progressive by the latter  . 
2 . We distinguish act-states from states , on one hand , for its wellformedness with the progressive , and from activities , on the other , because their presentense implies the progressive  . 
Example : He lives there , it hangs from the re = , ~ he is living there , it is hanging there .   1 ~ They were mentioned as problematic in \[4\] and ela ~ ed together in 3\]  .

We name acquisitions those verbs which express both the change that takes place and the resulting state  , such as remember , understand , know . They can be operationally p in pointed by the simultaneous acceptance of presentense and of point adverbials like suddenly in the past  .  ~ 4 . Finally , series can mean both an individual change and a set of them  . s They accept both frequency and duration adverbs in the simple past : 
Example : He coughed all night ~ once.
The temporal indices have roughly the same status of those in the semantic representation of UCG  ( 15\] , excep that we do not impose one ( sole ) index performula . We differ also in that we are not committed to a basic ontological distinction between states and events  , and that instead of those indexes we use plain temporal objects  . 
2.2 Grammatical mechanisms
Grammatical mechanisms are defined in terms of " simple " aspectual classes instead of a full translation into predicates of time  . We further need two basic operations , namely state creation ( Slat ) and activity creation ( Act ) :
Slat(P ) = PO
Act(P ) = act(Q )
The first abstracts from time , to model what we call temporal intensionality ( i . e . , non-dependence on temporal extension ) . The second creates a new activity ranging over an interval containing  2In Portuguese , where this clals is bigger , there is clearer evidence ~ namely the existence of a straightforward difference in meaning between the two " simple pasts "  , Per-felts and Imperfeito . References to this class ( uanmned ) can also be found in \[4 and\[6I , aln this last sense , they correspond to the ones in \[5\] . 
\[9\] uses the name " actions " for our series.
more than one instance of P , or , equivalently ~ covering an unhomogeneous temporal region where P is true  . The introduction of these two operations corresponds to our belief that there is more to sentence aspect than verbal aspect  , contrarily to what most classifications and calculi have assumed without questioning  . It seems to us that the latter is a proper subset of the former  . Thus , it makes perfectly sense to let morphosyntactic ( i . e . , nonlexical ) mechanisms introduce new aspect properties that cannot be found at the lexical level  . 
Let us now present some contrastive analyses : Progressive act  ( P ) ~ P ( t ) A inside ( t , I )
Progressive P :=?, Slat(Q)AQ(T ) A
P ( t ) A before(T , t ) A short ( T )
Estaract(P ) - ~ P ( t ) A inside(t , I)
By the first definition 4 , progressive applies to activities , achievements and acquisitions , and is au-tomatically true of act-states , or rather : for that class , the progressive and the non-progressive r-sions are equivalent  . 
The second definition encompasses the fllturate reading and stative uses such as He is resembling his father more and more  . With accomplish-rnents , progressive may be ambiguous between tile two . 
Estar , the Portuguese progressive , has only the first English reading . 
Sirnple PresP = ~. Slat(P ) AP ( now)
Presente P ~ Slat(P ) AP(T ) A inside ( now , T ) The English definition allows for the timeless truths X are Y and property reading such as She dances  , while the Portuguese one accounts for the fact that we say E stouem L is b on hd ? a nos  ( " I'm 4Whenever there are several definitions of tile same operator ~ an OR is intended  .

lmperfeito P : ~ state(P ) AP(T ) Abefore (7' , now ) Perfelts ~ final ( t , T ) A before ( t , now )
Simple Past P ~ before(t , now)
Perfect P ~ final(t,T ) At < . T . ~/' , Q ( T2 ) Tim above accounts for the following facts : I have run means I've finished  ( and similarly for any accomplishment/achievement )  , and that it gets translated by the Portuguese Perfeito in all those cases  . Also , I had run means it was finished before the time I amtalking abou  , t . Finally , to have done definitely means completion . We can also derive tim meaning of the present and past perfects : PresPerfP ~ final  ( t , T ) At 5~_T2AQ (7~) A Stat(Q ) A inside ( T2 .   .   .   .   .  )
Past Perf P ~ final(t , 7") At < 7: ~ A
Q(T2)AStat(Q ) A before(T2, now)
Just final(t,T ) 2, t < 7'. z ~ initial(t,I)
Afinal(T2, I ) A short ( I)
This definition allows one to apply just only fi~r perfect tenses  , and also to make just a function of measure , thus domain dependent ( by the use of the predicate short )  . Present perfect with just is translated in Portuguese by the aspectualize rae a bar  ( syntactically , a verb taking the preposition debefore the infinitive verb  ) Acabaract ( P ) Afinal ( t , 11) ~ act(Q ) A final ( t , 12) Afinal (12 , 11) A cabar P ( t ) ~ initial ( t , I ) Afinal ( T: , l ) A short ( I ) a cabar ( see\[2\] ) may either specify the last interval of an activity with definite end  , or a short interval after a point event ( change )  . This makes it ambiguous for accomplishments . 
PCact(P ) A final(t , T ) - ~ before ( now , t ) A initial ( i , T ) A before ( i , now )
PCP :> Act(P ) Afinal(now,I)
If Perfeito Composts ( PC ) takes an accomplishment , PC rueans the final is not yet over : Tenho e o n s t r u i d o a m in h a e a s a  ( I have been building my house )  . If it takes an activity , it means a set of distinct actual activities up to now : Ten hocot-rids  ( I have run lately )  . If it applies to a state , PC may represent a set of distinct states or an homogeneous p-to-now state : Tenhoesta do aqul to dasa squartas/desdeas  3  , just like its English present perfect translation  ( " I've been here every Wednesday/since 3 o'clock " )  , it should be mentioned that apart from states , the English translation of PC requires the adverb lately  . 
Latel y f l n a l ( t , 7") At <_T ~^ inside(T ~ , now ) initial ( t , I ) / ~ final ( now , I ) / ~ short ( I ) Tile formula above says that lately requires the present perfect  , and implies t < T ~ . This is justified if we note that even though states can be used with present perfect and lately in English  , this use requires that tile state does not extend tilnow : Have you been he relately f would otherwise not make sense  . 
Andar P ( t ) ~ Act(Q)
Andaract(P ) : ~- act(Q ) A inside ( lz , I 1 ) And are ither creates a big activity out of small events  , or selects a subactivity inside one . English renderings of the first meaning are keep - ing  , now and the nortim iterative progressive . The second is usually translated by the progressive  ( check the similarity with our translation of the English progressive  )  . 
2.3 Connectors
Connectors relate two different tense-aspectual descriptions and are realized ms temporal connectives or prepositions  . 
To clearly indicate their double input , we will use the symbol & to separate the conditions from the first and the second arguments  ( the second is the one immediately following the connector  )  . 
At P ( t ) & Q : ~ Q(t)
While act(P ) vP ( t ) & act(Q ) :> inside(T e , I0 ) While the translations above do not explain the different interpretations arising from different positioning of the arguments  , we believe that this is precisely the kind of information that should be brought by syntax  , though for tile moment we do not have a precise formulation for it  . 
3 Example
Example : " Many people died yesterday " .
die:act(die)A change(die ) A inside(t , ll ) yesterday : P ~ before(T , ,tow ) A day(T ) A 0 <
T-now < 24hA inside(Tp , 7") simple-past : P ~ before(T , now ) plural-NP : P = > Act ( P ) 5 die-yesterday : act ( die ) A change ( die ) A inside ( t , I ) A before ( T , now ) Aday(T ) A inside(t , T ) A inside(I , T ) died-yesterday : act ( die ) A change ( die ) A inside ( t , I ) A befo~e(T ,  . o , OA day ( T ) A inside(t , T ) A inside ( l , T ) SSince we are dealing only with tente-~pectual phenomena  , we ~ implify plural noun phrases interpreting them  ; ~s activity creation .

This example deliberately reflects an important issue  , namely , the relevance of nonverbal constituents to the over all aspect  , which is the subject of most calculi ( see\[13\] or\[7\] )  . We agree with Krifka\[7\] on that , as aspect marking on noun phrases in several anguages demonstrates  , there is no fundamental difference in the import brought by lexical aspect  , be it of verbs or other parts of speech . When we postulate a verbal aspect as opposed to sentence one  , thus , the stress should be on lexical rather than verbal  . What is particular to our approach is the belief that grammatical means  ( syntax or tense ) may pur-port significant aspect properties not available  ( or not present ) at the lexical level . 
4 Discussion
From a descriptive point of view , the system provides a liner characterization f verbs  , drawing an important distinction : that between the parts of a same situation and a don't care or vagueness associated with a lexical item  ( the first is related to the perception of an action by a speaker of a language  ; the second is related to the language system / lexicon  )  . 
Second , it is based on a linguistic comparison of two distinct languages  , therefore making it applicable at least to more than one  . This makes it also of interest for machine translation research  . 
Third , we expect a system thus formalized to be easy to extend  , simply by adding new and subtler constraints in the form of implications and/or complex syntax import  , and not bothering with the reasoning algorithm , by using standard logic . 
Finally , we think that this method has significant advantages compared to applicational models in the treatment of redundancy  . Redundancy is a pervasive property of natural anguage  , but it is hard to model when one device is required to apply before another  , each bringing different information . In this account , on the contrary , similar information brought in twice does nothing but assert it once  . 
To conclude , we should acknowledge that given the early stage of this investigation  , o implementation and thus testing results are yet available  .
