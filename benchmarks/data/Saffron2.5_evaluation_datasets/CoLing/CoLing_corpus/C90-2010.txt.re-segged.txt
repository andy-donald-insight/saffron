KCHEN % IS@TWNCTUO1 . BIT NETH SCHUREN@T WNAS8 86 . BITNET Abstract : In this paper we propose a framework of Information-based Case Grammar  ( ICG )  . This grammatical formalism entails that the lexical entry for each word contain both semantic and syntactic feature structures  . In the feature structure of a phrasal head , we encode syntactic and semantic constraints on grammatical phrasal patterns in terms of thematic structures  , and encode the precedence relations in terms of adjunct structures  . 
Such feature structures denote partial information which defines the set of legal phrases  . They also provide sufficient information to identify thematic roles  . With this formalism , parsing and thematic analysis can be achieved simultaneously  . Due to the simplicity and flexibility of Information-based Case Grammar  , context dependent and discontinuous relations such as agreements  , coordinations , long-distance dependencies , and control and binding , can be easily expressed . ICG is a kind of unification-based formalism . ' H : erefore it inherits the advantages of unification-bms cd formalisms and more  . 
In the feature structure of a phrasal head , we encode syntactic and semantic constraints on grammatical phrasal patterns haterms of thematic structures  , and encode the precedence rlations in terms of adjunct structures  . The feature structure of a potential phr~alhead denotes partial information for defining the set of legal/grammatical phrases  . It also provides enough information to identify the thematic roles for arguments and adjuncts \[ Chert  89\]  . In other words , with ICG , parsing and thematic analysis are achieved simultaneously without additional operation  ; and generation with thematic structure can be done with the identical formalism  . 
We take Mandarin Chinese as our representational target  . 
Thus , the features were selected to account for Chinese only  . 
I to we ver , the abstract design of this formalism is not limited to only the representation fChinese  . Since the Chinese lexicon is impoverished in inflection  , it is necessary to fully stipulate both semantic and syntactic information for the purpose of both parsing and generation  . Furthermore the precedence rlationship of constituent side fined over thematic roles  . This seems to be more appropriate for Chinese . By coincidence , Bresnen and Kanerva's\[Bresnan 89\] lexical mapping theory represents a shift towards the possibility of senmntics major approaches  . 
l . lntroductioz z
In this paper , we plopose a lexicon-based gramrrmtical formalism called hfformatiou-based Case Grammar  ( ICG )  . This form a \[ is nl entails that the lexical entry ff ~ reach word contain both sen : antic and syntactic information  . It wiI1 b cargtm d that our lexicon-based representation approach better focuses information for parsit : g a::d generatiot Lhi colltrast  , the phrase-structure rule approaches lack , ule focusing capability . Even with the LR parsing strategy\[Tomita 8@ ulmecessary branchilt g and backtracking cannot be avoided when adopting these approaches  . 
Therefore , modern linguistic theories share the tendency to be lexicon-based and to reduce I ' S rules  . For instance , LFG and ftPSG stipulate the argumet U structure as one of the attributes for each verb\[Bresnan  82  , Pollard 87\] and Karttunen\[Karttunen 86\] proposes a radical exicatism's approach to do without PS rules by representing syntactic itf formation in terms of categorial grail \] mar  . Categorial granunar , however , offers no straightfop . vard and intuitive mechanisms to handle context dependent or discontinuous relation such as control and long distance dependency \ [ Uszkoreit  86\]  . llence , we adopt an alterlaative approach equivalent to the ID/LP  ( immediate dominance and linear prcccd cace ) format of GPSG\[Gazdar87\] . 
2 . Feature Structures for Mandarin Chinese Chinese is a weakly marked language with no inflection  . 
Nevertheless , the linear order of arguments and adjuncts are relatively free  . Hence syntactic-only representations would cause tremendous ambiguities  . For representational precision and for parsing adequacy  , semantic information is indispensibte . The most important semantic information includes 1  . argument structures and their semantic restrictions  , and 2 . the semantic features for each word which ; ire necessary to identify thematic roles , ltcnce the following feature structure ( 1 ) was selected so that each texical entry can be uniformly represented by the same structure with lexicalty or syntactically defined value  ( including null )  .

Meaning : an atomic value denoting the motoring of tile word  . 
Features : a set of atomic values which are tile semantic features of the word  ; e . g . +animate , - ~ physical . 
Arguments : a set of thematic arguments for the head if the word is a possible phra  . salhead ; nullothmwise . The value for each thematic argument is a feature structure of the same type ~ u ~ the value for tile feature path ' semantic '  . 
E . g . ' a nice boy ' is an agent , as in ' A nice boyd rove the cattle .

C~me restrictions indicate semantic preferences of then mtic roles and function as a guide to identifying each case role \[ Chen  89\]  . The argument structures furother phrasal heads such as prepositions  , postpositions ; . tnd conjunctions serve similar purposes . 
Adjuncts : a set of pcrmissible adjuncts of the head word  . 
The value of each adjunct is a feature structure of the same type as arguments  . 
E . g . ' yestmday ' ( 4 ) time : meaning : ' yesterday ' features : + time arguments : none\[acjuncts:noneArguments  , adjuncts and head form the right hand side of an immediate dominance rule  . 
Syntactic Class : atomic values denoting the syntactic class of the word  . 
" Ilm syntactic class of a word serves two purposes  . The first is to denote the syntactic type . 
The second is as an index for inheriting common syntactic properties belonging to the mother node in the syntactic hierarchy  , Syntactic Form : a set of syntactic and semantic definitions for arguments and adjuncts  . 
" Ilm syntactic form for each thematic role in fact constrains the syntactic structures and semantic features of this role  . We consider semantic restriction as part of the syntactic on straint  . For instance , temporal expressions are instantiated by at least five different syntactic ategories which are nouns phrase  ( NPs )  , compounds with determinatives and measures ( DM , such as Swz . 
dittoShi-fen three-hour sten-minute , i . e . ' three-ten') , postposition phrases ( GPs ) , preposition phrases ( PPs ) , bradver bs ( ADVs ) . They all share a cornmon semantic feature+time regardless of their categories  . Therefore tile temporal cxprcssions can be expressed as time\[NP  , DM , PP , GP , ADV , + time\] . For complex expressions , we adopt the choice system used by tlalliday in the systemic grammar\[Winograd  83\]  . 
Basic Patterns : a set of linear precedence rules governing arguments and heads  . 
The basic patterns for verbs denote the possible sentent k d patterns  , including optional argument omission . The familiar syntactic generalizations with regard to passivizatio % topicalization etc  . can be captured by lexical rules \[ Gazdar 85 , Pollard 87 , Sells 85\] . Adopting the lexical mapping theory , however , is a theoretical possibility to make basic patterns obsolete\[Bresnan  89  , Huang89\] . 

Adjunct Precedence : a set of linear precedence and cooccurrence constraints for adjuncts  . 
The following notations were adopted.
*: denotes a phrasal head.
<: e.g . " a<b " denotes a precedes b.
< < : e . g . " a << b " denotes a immediately precedes 12 . 
> < : e . g . " a > < b " denotes a and b cannot cooccur . 
: e . g . " a < t2 , _c " denotes a precedes both b and_c but there are no preced-ence constraints between b and c  .

Basic Patterns encode phrasal heads and their arguments  . Linear order is but an additional piece of information describing the pattern  . It is conceivable , i . e . in nonconfigurational languages , that linear precedence relations play no role in Basic Patterns  . Adjunct Precedence Rules , on the other hand , are constraints on linear precedence relations among possible adjuncts  . In other words , linear order is central to Adjunct Precedence statements while the presence of each adjunct is not  . 
" I2ms , a legal phrase can be viewed as a sequence of thematic roles arranged in a proper order defined by one of the basic patterns and satisfying all the constraints of Adjuncts Precedence when qpplicable  . The division of BasicP attents from Adjunct Precedence is similar to the ID/LP format with the additional inforrnation differentiating adjunts from arguments  . The limhed numbers of thematic cases , syntactic categories , and semantic features require only a finite number of notational symbols \[ Gazdar  87\]  . " ~ erefore we claim that ICG fails into the ch , ss of contextfree grammars . 
The semantic features would be unified during parsing while the syntactic features are no more than constraints guiding appropriate unification  . We\[lave a scheme to identify the thematic roles by ' fully utilizing the semantic af ~ d syntactic information \[ Chen  89\]  . In\[Chen89\] , Chen et al propose an information accumulation scheme  ( incremental description refinement in \[ Mellish 88\]  ) for identifying thematic roles with the parametricalized information encoded with the ICG formalism  . The four types of parametric inforn a at it m used in Chinese are : a  .   th_2e ~utactic ~ and semantic features of the constituent  , b . the case frame and sern\[n~tic rstrictio as of the verb  , c . tlae ~ ntacticonfiguration and word order , and d . obliqE_e " case as si~gner , includ in ~ rp_L~msitions and postpositions . 
Following is the parsing result of 3 . 77 ze Formal Definition for hz formation . based Case
Grwnmar : The Lexicon and Principles rl'be ICG is composed of two major components  . One is the lexicon which is the set of feature structures ms described in section  2  . The other is the principles . Each feature structure can be viewed as a set of interpretabler presentations of syntactic and semantic information governed by a formal synt ~  . A parser or generator interpretes feature structures while parsing or generating sentences  . The interpretation processes are guided by the principles of the grammar  , qheprinciples define wellformedness conditions and the rules for infommtion management for sentences and phrases  . The parser or generator takes lexical information and unify it in such a way that changes of lexical information wouklnot affect the phr  , ' ksing or generating process . 
Therefore we claim that ICG is declarative , qlm major principles of ICG are summarized below :   1  ) II ead Driven Principle The feature structure of a head contains the partial information that defines the permissible set of phrases with it  , ' ksaphrasal head . The possible head types and respective phrase types for Mandarin Chinese are as follows  .

Determinant DM ( determinatire at ldnleasure couq~mtnd ) 
Conjunction CP ( conjunctive phrase)
The syntactic classes of the heads determine the syntactic types of their projections  . VP is defined as an S without subject \[ Gazdar 87\]  . 
5632) Wellformedness Conditions
Like LFG\[Bresnan82\] , we have tim following wellformedness conditions : a  . Completeness and functional biuniqueness conditions  , b . Coherence conditions , and c . Linear precedence and syntactic form constraints . 
In fact , the completeness condition is enforced with respect to Basic Patterns  ( BP ) only . The cases of argument omission are idiosyncratically determined by verb classes  , and are nut governed by the completeness condition  , On the other hand , adjuncts are optional and constrained or fly by linear precedence rules AP and form restrictions  . The functional uniqueness condition is also relaxed a bit to account furcases of multiple occurrences of some adjunct such as modal at the sentential level  , and rop_Lg . p_~~ on the noun phrase level , by annotating Kleene'star on top of the adjunct modal and the adjunct  3  ) Feature Propagation Principles a . Head feature conve , ) tion\[Gazdar85\],b . Foot feature principle\[Gazdar85\],e . Explicit feature paths : Explicitly denoting the daughter's feature in the mother node by a feature path such as the ' argument feature '  , d . Conditional features : Locally ambiguous semantic features can be expressed by conditional features  . For iJrstance , the preposition bei'by ' can mark an agent , a causer , or an instrument depending upon whether the arguments are animate  , nonphysical , or physical inanimate respectively . Therefore the feature structure of bei'by ' would be  ( 7 )  .

Tim three required types of semantic features for Chinese are  1  . semantic classes e . g . + animate 2 . syntactic/semantic feature , e . g . + NEG 3 . thematic roles , e . g . AGENT . Different types of features can be identified simply by their attribute names e  . g . we know AGENT in < ARGUMENTAGENT > is a thematic role  . 
The head feature principle is thcsame as the one in GPSG\[Gazdar  85\] which states that in any local subtree , the head features of the mother are identical to the hcad features of the head daul  , hter . Similarly , our Foot feature principle also follows GPSG . Roughly speaking , foot features are passed up from any daughter in a tree  , with the upper and lower limits of this propagation are determined by prior specification \[Gazdar  85\]  . 
In Chinese , +_ . Question , + Negation , + Plural , + Definite etc . 
are all considered foot features.
The semantic lass of a thematic role is usually determined by its head daughter  . However , for the marked cases with the syntactic categories of PP/GP  , the semantic classes are determined by complement daughters  . We cannot define every semantic type , as a foot feature . Therefore , we propose to explicitly state the daughter's feature in the mother node by a feature path such as ' DUMMY feat m'es'in  ( 7 )  . 
4 . What Makes ICG a Good Representational Language We think that the simplicity and flexibility of the ICG formalism makes it a good representational language  . It is simple since ICG is a type of contextfree gramnmr and the attributes for feature structures arenni form for all differentypes of phrases  . 
Preparation of lexical feature structures are straightfonvard  . 
Linguists can start with the categorial feature structure of each entry by discovering idividual id in syncracies and then modifying the categorial feature structure accordingly  . As for flexibility , ICG is much more flexible than tile other contextfree grammatical forms such as BNF  , GPSG , etc . , due to the wider scope of accessibility and the richness of informatioh encoding on each thematic on stituent  . Context dependent and discontinuous rdafions such as agreements  , coordinations , long-distance dependencies , control and binding , can be easily expressed in

4.1 Agreementaltd Coordhmtion
Agreement and coordination pose similar problems in representation  ( but different proNems in processing )  . Both have to express the relations between daughters  . Coordination can he viewed as the agreement of syntactic or / and semantic lasses between two daughter arguments of a conjunction  . In contrast , other types of agreements are the relations between head daughter and complement daughters  . Since ICG provides an explicit accessing capability to tim daughters features  , both types of agreements can be easily solved . The only difference is that coordination requires aw ~ riable ranging over a finite domain of syntactic classes and/or semantic classes to denote the common features of two arguments  ( 8 )  . For instance , the subject verb agreement problems are solved by stating agreement constraints on each subject role in every basic pattern  . For example , the AGENT of the verb " persuades " is expressed as  , AGENT\[NP , + singular , + third \] in active voice .

DUM Y Y 2: feature : class x 45 74 .   2 Long-distattce DepeiMency Kaplan and Zaenen\[ Kaplan  88  , Kaplan 89\] proposed functional uncertainty as a new descriptive technique  , assuming grammatical function in LFG , in order to account for long-distance dependencies  . The schema of functional uncertainty avoid the . problem of infinite specifications so that the attribute positions for topicalizable constituet  , us cot , ld be realized as a regular expression such as ( T comp subj\[obj ) = ( T topic )  . This equation expresses the uncertainty about what the within clause functional roles of an extraposed topic might be  . It offered a clearer and mr . ~ reaccurate characterization of long-distance dependencies but still could not handle the case of context dependency in topicalization  . For instance , there are many verbs in Chinese which do not allow the object to be topicalized  . When such a verb is the head of a a embedded sentence  , it is clear that ( compobj ) is not toplicalizable either . There is no way to predict the topicalizable constituent in depth by way of regular expressions  . There are similar examples in English .

Who/did Mary think that Bills awei ? ? Who/ did Mary quip that Bills awei ? Who/did John tell you  ( that ) Mary thought that Bill sawei ? ? Who/did John tell you  ( that ) Mary quipped that Bills awei?l Iowever we can solve such context dependent problen rs in ICG by recursively defining the topicalizable constituents in terms of topicalizable constituents of embedded sentences  . The verb with sentential complements usually causes the problems  . We may encode the topicalized sentence patterns ms a part of BP or as derived by iexical rules  . The topic of the embedded sentence is ope of the topicalizable cot~sdtuents of such "? erb  . ~< For instance the topicalized sentence pattern of example  ( 2 ) is : TOPIC\[TOPIC ( THEME ) \] < AGENT\[NP\]<?<
GOAL\[NI'\]<T ttEME/TOPIC
The topics of embedded sentences are defined rccursively under the sent cncepatterns of the verbs of embedded sentences  . Detailed discussion is given in \[ Chen90,
Huang 90\].
4.3 Control and Binding
Functional controlistile relation that exists between an antecedent and the missing subject in an XCOMP or XADJUNCT\[Bresnan  82  , Sells 85\] . The coindex label adopted in the unification -based grammars is a simple solution to such problems  . We use the same scheme in ICG , e . g . in (2) . 
Anaphoric binding was solved in LFG by the concept of F-command\[Bresnau  82  , Sells 851 . The same concept is also applicable to ICG .

From the brief sketch above , it is clear that e : x ch lexical entry contains a large amount of redundant syntactic and semantic information shared by other entries belonging to the same category  , llence , a more elegant and economic strategy is to form a category hierarchy and to store shared information on higher level nodes  . Each lexical entry contains only individual idiosyncracies  . Thus the redundancy in representation can be removed and data consistency can also be easily maintained  . 
ICG is a kind of unification-based formalism . Therefore all the advantages of unification-based formalism were kept in ICG  . 
Furthernmre , additional advaqtages are incorporated via the following design features of ICG  . 
1 . Declarative " II ~ elexical information defines legal sentences or phrase  . And the changes in the above information does not affect processing procedures and results  . 
2. Algorithm-free
Different control processes are allowed for parsing or generation  . Regardless of whether it is sequential , parallel , or heuristic ontrol , the result will be the same . 
3. Suitable for parallel processing
The processes are head driven . Each possible head can initiate a phrasal construction process  . Thus , processes can be executed in parallel . 
4. Allows a partial parse
At any moment of the unification processes , the accumulated information shows the partial result up to that momem even if the input is ungrammatical  . 
5. Semantic structure is universal
The semantic information contained in the feature structures of each lexical entry is universal  . Different languages differ with regard to syntactic of information  . 
6 . Incorporated with then mtic role identification schen ~ e The parametrical information for identifying thematic roles can boencoded in ICG such that syntactic parsing and semantic analysis can be done in parallel  . 
7 . Parsing result is a thematic structure Recent theoretical linguistic studies are concerned with the relationship between thematic structures and argument structures  ( e . g . Brensan and Kanerva 1989) . 
Our formalism directly and explicitly represents hematic structures  . 
Last but not least , we expect future studies of ICG to confirm tile plausibility of the following advantages  . 
1. Efficient parsing
ICG has the advantages of lexicon-based parsing which is better focused on the relavant syntactic and semantic information  . 
2. Cognitive reality
The language capability of a man seems to be improved day after day by learning and polishing lexical information  . ICG is able to reflect this phenomenon . 
5853. Germration power
ICG provides a way of generating surface se Ilteilces froilithematic structures  . The pragmatic consideration of the selection of the sentence patterns can be accomplished by incorporating the pragmatic features in the basic patterns and lexical rules  .
