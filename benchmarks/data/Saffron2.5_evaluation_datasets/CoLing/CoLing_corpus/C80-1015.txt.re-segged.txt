This paper proposes a model of
automatic processing of time-related expressions by introducing the notion of focus in the cognition level  . The lin-guistic categories of time are determined on the basis of the rela-tionships among the time of an extra-linguistics ituation  , the focused time and the time of utterance . 

It is generally understood that there is no one -to-one correspondence between the extra-l inguistic  ( real world ) time of situations and the gram-matical expressions of time in sentences of natural languages  . If there is no correspondence of the extra-l inguistic situation to the linguistic expressions  , it is impossible to simulate this process by a computer model  . 
This paper proposes a model of automatic process ing of time-related expressions by in t roducing the notion of focus in the cognition level between the extra-linguistic time of situations and the linguistic express ions of time  . 
As well , it points the way toward the computer-reali zation of the model  . The computer programming language used for this model is SNOBOL  . 
Failure of correspondence between an extra- linguistic situation and lin-guistic expressions of the time concept can easily be demonstrated in most languages  , if not all . For example , suppose the extra-linguistic situation is the speaker's writing during a certain period in the past  ( say , between two and three o'clock yesterday ) . In reference to it , we can use any of the following sentences . 
( i ) I wrote a letter.
(2) I was writing a letter.
(3) I have written a letter.
(4) I had written a letter ( when
John came).
The differences among sentences ( i ) through ( 4 ) are attributed to the speaker's different point of view  . 
Comri@mentions that ' aspects are different ways Qf viewing the internal temporal consti tuenc\[~of situations  . ' The speaker's way of viewing , however , affects not only his choice of aspects but also his choice of tenses  . Note the following examples from Japanese . 
(5) ahsokoniaru.
' There it is I ' (6) ahsokoni atta.
' There it was ( all the time )!'
There is no difference in the denota-tive meaning of sentences  ( 5 ) and ( 6 )  . 
Both sentences can be used when someone has found something he has been looking for  . Whether the speaker uses sentence ( 5 ) or sentence ( 6 ) depends , again , on his viewpoint . 

The difference in the speaker's view-point , or that of cognition , cannot be ignored , as seen in the above examples , when we consider the time-related expressions of natural language  . Physical events in the extra-linguistic wor ld present themselves as sense data  , and are perceived not pass-ively , but actively by an intervention of mind , and are subsequently stored in the momory as experiences  . The experi-ences represent the material that can be formulated and articulated as thel inguistic forms  . 
We believe that unless we incorporate cognit ion into the process of generating linguistic expressions we cannot explain the relations h ip between the extra-linguistic situat ions and the linguistic expressions  . And we con-sider the notion of focus the most important cognitive element in connection wi th time-related expressions  . ' Focus'is defined as the period along the extra-linguistic time line upon which the speaker directs his attention  . 

By incorporating the speaker's focus into a model we can generate the time-related express ions rather  -101 -- automatically , that is , by one-to-one correspondence , and therefore it is possible to implement this model as a computer model to generate linguistic expressions  . 
For the model we consider three levels ; that is , i . the extra-linguistic ( realworld ) level , 2 . the cognition level , and 3 . the linguistic level . 
Information on extra-linguistic situations observed by the speaker is stored in the extra- linguistic level in the form of the situation and its existing period of time  . The speaker's focus in the cognition level is matched against the situation  ( s ) in the extra-linguistic level and the way they match or do not match determines the selection of linguistic items such as verbs  , adjectives , negation , aspect and tense . 
The linguistic level forms the sentences by syntactic  , morphological and phonological rules . 
EXTRA-LINGUISTICLE VEL
The computer model under consideration simulates this process by our creating three levels here also  . The extra-linguistic level stores information on situations in the following form  ( Nos . 29 of the appended program ) .

The information includes situation in the form of verbal expressions and their arguments  , the starting time of dynamic situations , the ending time of dynamic situations , and the ending time of static situations . In the number for the time , the first two digits stand for the month , the next two for the day , the next two for the hour , and the last two for the minute . This number system may be expanded to include the year  , the second , etc . 
Extra-linguistic situations are divided into two categories  ; dynamic and static . Fox the distinction , let us quote LyonsJ(p .  483)  . 
A static situation ( or state-of-affairs , or state ) is one that is conceived of as existing , rather than happening , and as being homogeneous , continuous and unchanging throughout its duration  . A dynamic situation , on the other hand , is something that happens ( or occurs , or takes place ) : it may be momentary or enduring ; it is not necessarily either homogeneous or continuous  , but may have any of several temporal contours; . . . 
Dynamic situations are in turn divided into two types  . Those such as ' reading ' are situations occurring for a certain period of time  . Therefore situations of this type have a starting time and an ending time  . The second type of dynamic situation , like ' ( alight ) going on ' , is momentary , and therefore it is understood that the starting time and the ending time are identical  . 
Static situations , on the other hand , continue for a certain period of time . But they may be results of dynamic situations and they may also change into other situations again by dynamic situations  . The starting time of a static situation is usual ly the ending time of a dynamic situation and its ending time  , if any , is the starting time of another dynamic situation . 
It is worth mentioning here that what are stored in this level are not linguistic expressions but situations  . 
Therefore , the time period of an existing situation is not influenced by the type of particular linguistic expressions of a particular natural language  . Taking an English expression for example ,  ' ( alight ) goes on ' is considered to be momentary event . 
Therefore , we cannot say ' ~ alight is going on . ' However , 'lights are going on ' is possible , in which case we can identify a different starting time and ending time  . Further , if we could observe the period of duration of a light going on by a high-speed film for instance  , the different starting and ending times could be recorded in the data by expanding time digits to second or millisecond  . 
However , there are some phenomena peculiar to individual languages  . For instance , the situation of ' coming ' is --102--cons idered to have a time duration in English . Therefore , ' John is coming ' is a paraphrase of ' John is on the way  . ' But in Japanese it is considered to be momentary  , that is , ' coming ' is a sort of switch from ' is not here ' to ' is here '  . Therefore there is not Japanese expression equ ivalent to English ' John is coming  . ' Theoretically , this kind of difference among individual languages should be taken care of by elab-or at ing the structure of situations in the data of this level  , but in the current model it is taken care of by the linguistic level  . 
COGNITION LEVEL
Now in the cognition level , the focused situation and the period of focus as well as the time of utterance are inserted into the program  ( Program Nos .  1027) . The focused situation is in the form of verbal expression and its arguments  . The period of focus is in the form of either a time adverbial such as ' now '  , ' this morning ,   , ' yesterday ' and ' last month ' , or numbers for chronological time points s imilar to those of extra-linguistics i tuation time  . When the input is a time adverb-ial , the program calculates it against the time of utterance and translates it into chronologica l numbers  ( Program
Nos . 28-40).
So far , data stored in the program are : i . Extra-linguistic situations , each comprising : a . the starting time-point of a dynamic situat ion  ( A )  , b . the ending time-point of a dynamic situation ( B )  , c . the ending time-point of a static situation ( C )  ;  2 . Time of utterance ( O ) : 3 . Focused situation , comprising : a . the starting time-point of focus ( S ), and b . the ending time-point of focus ( E ) . 
Here it is checked whether a par-ticular extra -linguistic situation exists within the focused period or moment and  , if so , how it is focused . 
On the basis of the relationship among the three kinds of time-points of an extra-l inguistic situation  ( A , B and C ) , and the two kinds of focus time-points of the same focused situation  ( S and E )  , the cagegories of aspects are determined ( Program Nos .  4162) . 
The categories of aspects are determined in the following way: 
I .






If the focus is on the Static
Situation ( SS ) ~ and if the focus is on the point , and if the focus is completely inside the SS , then : STATIVE , otherwise , the Dynamic Situ-ation ( DS ) is checked . 
If it is otherwise , and if the SS overlaps the focus completely , then :
STATIVE , otherwise , the DS is checked.
II . If the focus is completely outside the DS , then : NEGATIVE . 


If the focus is on a point , and if the DS is on a point , then : PERFECTIVE . 
2 . If it is otherwise , and a . if the focus is on the beginning of the DS , then : PER-
FECTIVE ( INGRESSIVE ), b . if the focus is on the ending of the DS , then : PERFECTIVE ( COMPLETED ) , c . if neither of the above , then:




a ? b .



If the focus is on a period , and if the DS is on a point , then : PERFECTIVE . 
If it is otherwise , and the DS overlaps the focus completely , then : IMPERFECTIVE , if the DS overlaps the focus partially , and the beginning of the DS is on or before the ending of the focus  , then : PERFECTIVE ( INGRESSIVE ) , the ending of the DS is on or before the ending of the focus  , then : PERFECTIVE ( COMPLETED ) , it is neither of the above , then : PERFECTIVE . 
This aspect assignment is illustrated in the diagrams in the Appendix I  . 
The categories of tenses are in turn determined on the basis of the relationship between the focused time and the time of utterance  ( Program
Nos .  6369) . If the focus is on the time of utterance , the PRESENT is assigned . If the focus is before the time of utterance , the PAST is assigned ~ if the reverse , the FUTURE . 
Japanese and Russian , for example , work in this way . In English one more --103--category of tense is needed . That is , if the focus is on a period and the end of the focus coincides with the time of utterance  , the PAST-PRESENT is assigned . 
This category will later cover expressions like ' I have been studying linguistics  . '
FINAL REMARKS
In the linguistic level time-related morphemes are assigned on the basis of the categories of t ime-related expressions sent from the cognition level  . Here the peculiarities of individual natural languages are involved  . 
Therefore a unique program is required for each natural language  . After the morpheme assignments , syntactic and morphological rules together with phonological rules determine the forms in the sentences  . 
We shallom it detailed discussion on this level , since this process involving word categories closely related to the distinction between dynamic and static situations is complicated  . For simplicaity of explanation , we have omitted the discussion and the programming of expressions of habit  , experience and a temporal expressions . 
We have also omitted the discussion of relative tenses  . 
In summary , we have discussed an automatic process of time -expression generation in natural language  . We believe that this is only possible by the introduction of the speaker's time focus and an examination of the rela-tionship between the extra-linguistic situational time and focused time  . By further examining the manner of morpheme assignments in as many natural languages as possible  , we believe , we can expand the number of universal rules common to all languages and minimize the number of rules peculiar to individual languages  .
