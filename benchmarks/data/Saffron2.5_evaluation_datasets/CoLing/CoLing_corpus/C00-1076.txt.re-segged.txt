In the last decade , members of the computational lingt , is-tics community have adopted a perspective on discourse based primarily on either Rhetorical Structure Theory or Grosz and Sidner's Theory  . However , only recently , re . + searchers have started to investigate the relationship between the two perspectives  . In this paper , we use Moscr and Moore's ( 1996 ) work as a departure point for extending Marcu's formalization of RST  ( 1996 )  . The result is a tirst-order axiomatization of the mathematical prol+er-ties  o1' text structures and of the rehttionship between the strttcture of text and intentions  . The axiomatization enables one louse intentions for reducing the ambiguity  o1' discourse and the structure of discourse for deriving intentional inferences  . 
I Motivation
In the last decade , members of the computational linguis-lies cotnnmnity have adopted a perspective on discourse based prinlarily on either lhetorical Structure Theory  ( P , ST ) ( Matin and Thompson ,  1988 ) or Grosz and Sidher's Theory ( GST )   ( Grosz and Sidnet .  1986) . 
In GSq , the linguistic on stituents are called discom'xe segments  ( DS ) and the ling t , istic discourse slructure is explicitly stipulated to be a tree  o1' recursively embedded discourse segments . Each discourse segment is charac-tel+ized by a prinmry intention  , which is called discomwe segment lmrpose ( DSP ) . GST identilies only two kinds o1' intention-based relations that hold between the DSPs of two discourse segments : domittance and sati  . @ tc tion precedence . When a discourse segment purpose DSPI that characterizes discourse segment  DS1 provides part of the satisfaction of a discourse segment purpose DSP  . , that characterizes discourse segment DS . . , , with DS1 being embedded in DS2 , it is said that there exists a dominance relation between DSP ~ and DS lq  , i . e . , DSP . e dominates DS pI . 1 t ' the salisl hction of DSP , is a condition of the satisfaction oI'DSP2 , it is said that DSP1 sati , @ tc tion-precedes DSP . , . 
RST has a richer ontology of relations than GST : intentional and semantic rhetorical relations are considered to hold between non-overlaplfing textual spans  . Most of these relations are asymmetric , i . e . , they distinguish between their associated nuclei  , which express what is most essential to the writer's purpose  , and their satellites , which supportile nuclei . In RS'I , the linguistic discourse structure is modeled recursively as a tree of related segments  . Hence , unlike GSq , where relations are considered to hold between the DSPs associated with embedded segments  , relations in RST hold between adjacent , nonoverlapping segments . 
Because RST has traditionally been applied to build discourse trees of liner granularity than GST  , we will use it here as the starting point of our discussion  . Assume , for example , that we are given tim following text ( in which the elementary textual units arc labelled l brreference  )  .

D~I Assume for the momen that we do not analyze this text as a whole  , but rather , we dct crl nine what rhetorical relations could hold between every pair of elementary units  . 
When we apply , for example , the definitions proposed by Mann and Thompson ( 1988 )  , we obtain the set given below , l ' rh , c ~_ , rcl(JUSTIFICNI'ION , Ara B1) rhcl . rrel(JUSTIFICATI()N , I ) 1~I ~ , 1) (2) r /+ ct_rcl(F , Vll ) ENCF , ( h , I ~ q ) ' rhcI . _ . rcl(CONCFSSION , I)i , C1) ' rhet_rcI(RFSTATF . MENT ,  1)1 , A 1 ) These relations hold because the tmd cr standing of both  A1   ( teens want to stay nonsmokers ) and I:h ( 9 0%   o1' the teens think that smoking is something that they wotd dnever do  ) will increase the reader's readiness to accept the writer's right to present I h  ( the pressure on teens to start smoking is greater than it will be any other time of their lives  )  ; the understanding of c1 ( 3000 teens start smoking each day ) will increase the reader's belief of 1~1 ; the recognition of I has something compatible with I Throughoul this paper  , we use the convention lhat rhelori-cal relations are represented as stated  , lirst-order predicales having lhefor nlrhct_rel ( , act . me,mLzellite,?~mlcus ) .

Marcu ( 1996 ) has shown that on the basis of only the rhetorical judgments in  ( 2 ) and without considering intentions , there are five valid RS-trces that one can build for text  ( I )   ( see figure l )  . What happens though when we consider intentions as well ? Moore and Pollack  ( 1992 ) have already shown that different high-level intentions yield different RS-trces  . But how do we formalize tile relationship between intentions and rhetorical structures ? For example  , how can we use the discourse trees in figure 1 in order to determine the primary intention associated with each analysis ? And how can we determine what would be the corresponding dominance relations in a GST account of tile same text'?Consider also a slightly difl'erent problem : assume that besides rhetorical judgments  , such as those shown in (2) , one can also make intentional judgments . For example , assume that one is interested in an interpretation i which one knows that the DSP of seg  , nent\[& , D1\] , which contains all units from A1tO1) 1 , dominates the DSP of segment \[ c1 , l ) ~\] . Then what is the primary intention of the text in that case '? And how many discourse trees are both valid and consistent with that intentional judgment ? Neither RST nor GST can answer these questions on their own  . However , a unified theory can . Ill this paper , we provide such a theory . 
2 The limits of Moser and Moore's approach In a recent proposal  , Moser and Moore ( 1996 ) argued that the primary intentions in a GST representation can be derived fi'om the nucleiot ' the corresponding RST representation  . Although their proposal is consistent with the cases in which each textual span is characterized by an explicit nucleus that encodes the primary intention of that span  ( as in the case of text ( I ) ) , it seems that an adequate account of the correspondence bt ween GST and RST is somewhat more complicated  . For example , in tile case of text (3) below , whose RST analysis is shown in ligure 2 , we cannot apply Moser and Moore's approach because we can associate tile primary intention of discourse segment \[  a2  , B2\] neither to trait A2 nor to trait B2 .

' ~2\] [ Hewentcrazy , c2\]In Grosz and Sidner's terms , we can say that the primary intention ot ' segment\[  A2  , B ~\] is ( Intend writer ( Believe reader " John wanted to do two things that were incompatible "  ) ) . But in order to recognize this relation , we need to recognize that the two desires given in units A ~ and  B2 are incompatible , which is captured by the CONTRAST relation that holds between the two units  . In other words , the intention associated with segment \[ A2 , B2\] is a function both el'its nuclei , A2 and B2 , and of the rhetorical relation of CONTRAST that holds between them  . 
In this paper , we generalize this obserwttion by making use o1" the compositionality criterion proposed in ( Marcu ,  1996) , which stipulates that it ' a rhetorical relation holds between two textual spans  , as i , nilar relation also holds between two salient constructs of those spans  . 2 Similarly , we will assume that the primary intention of a discourse segment is not given by the nucleus of the corresponding relation but rather that it depends on the corresponding relation and the salient constructs associated with that segment  . 
3 Melding text structures and intentions 3 . 1 Formulation of the problem Formally , the problem that we want to solve is the following  . Given a sequence of textual units U = tq , u2, .   .   .   , UN , a set 1U ~ of rhetorical relations that hold among these units  , and a set o1' intentional judgments IH that pertain to the same units  , find all legal discourse structures ( trees ) of U , and determine the dominance , satisl'action-precedence relations , and primary intentions of each span of these trees  . 
Following ( Marcu ,  1996) , we use tile predicates posiHo , z(ui , j ) and vl , eId'd ( , za , , , e , s , z ) with the fol-2Seclion   3 discusses in detail how the salient construcls are deler-mined  . 
524 lowing semantics : tim predicate posilion ( ui , j ) is tree for a textual unitul in sequence U if and only if ul is the jth element in the sequence  ; the predicater hei_vel(namc , ui , uj ) is true for textual unit sulanduj witb respect or hetorical relation name  , if and only it ' the detinition provided by RST for rhetorical relation name applies to textual units ui  , in most cases a satellite , and uj , a nucleus . In order to enable discourse problems to be characterized by rhetorical judgments that hold between large textual spans as well  , we use predicater h . cl_rel_ext(namc,s ~, s ~,*~, n ~) . This predicate is trl , e for textual spans\[ss ,   . %\] and\[,, . , ,   n0\] with respect to rhetorical relation name if and only if the detinition of rhetorical relation name applies for tim textual span that ranges over units ss--se  , ill most cases a satellite , alld textual spans that ranges over units n . ~- nc , a nucleus . 3 From a rhetorical perspective , text ( I ) is described at the minimal unit level by the relations given in  ( 2 ) and ( 4 ) below . 
fl , ositio , , . ( A1,1), 1ositio,~(lh,2), (4) 1, ositio , , . ( C  ~ , 3) ,  1 , ositio , ,O ) ,   ,  1 ) The intentional judgments 1~1 are given by the following functions and predicates : ? The predicated om  ( l  ~ , lq ,  1~ , h- , ) is true whenever tbe DSP of discourse segment /span\[  I1  , hl\]dominatesttleDSI'of discourse segment\ [ l  ~  , h:~\] . A dominance relation is wellformed if segment \ [ /~  , h ~\] is a proper subsegment of segment \[ ll , h , t \] . i . e . , l,</~<h . , < h,A(h?z~vh ~ #h ~) . 
? The predicates alp vec(ll , Ih , lu , h . . , ) is true whenever an intentional satisfactiol > precedence relation holds between the DSI's of segments Ill  , hi \] and \[/2 , h2\] . A satisfaction-precedence relation is wellformed if tile segments do not overlap  . 
? Tile oracle function . f l(r , aq , .   .   .   ,   ; % ) takes as at : guments arhetorical relation r and a set of text tufl units  , and returns t be primary intention that pertains to that relation and those units  . For example , in the case of segment \[ A2 , Be \] in text (3) , the oracle function . l ) ( CONTRAST , A2 , B2 ) is assullted to returu a Iirst-order object wl tose meaning can be glossed as " inform the reader that John wanted to do two things that were incompatible "  . And the oracle function . 1) ( EWDI ~; NcE , B1) associated with segntent\[A1 , 1 ) ~\] in text ( 1 ) is assunt cd to return a\[irst-oMer object whose n teaning can be glossed as " increase the reader 's belief that the pressure to smoke in junior high is greater than it will be any other time of one's life "  . 
Without restricting the generality of the problem , discourse structures are assented to be binary trees  . In our formalization , each node era discourse structure is char -aclerized by l  ( )tu " features : the status ( nucleus or satellite )  , tim O'l Je ( the rhetorical relations tlmt hold between 3'Fhe s ~ lll de subscripls CO lTC gpond Io . ~ tm ' ling ~ . lll ( I ending posilions . 
the text spans that that node spans over ) , the l ) romotion set ( the set of units that constitute the most " salient "  ( ira-pertain ) part of the text that is spanned by that node )  , and tile i ) rima O , intelltion . By convention , for each leaf node , the type is LEAF , the promotion setistile textual unit to which it corresponds  , and t be primary intention is that of in Jbmting the content of that unit  . For exam-pie , a representation f the tree in ligure 1 . a that makes explicit the features el ' all spans that play an active role in the final representation is given in \[ igure  3  . In general , the salient units are computed using the comlmsitionality criterion proposed in  ( Marcu ,  1996) , i . e , they are given by the union of the salient units of the immediate subordinated nuclei  . Similarly , the primary intentions are a function of t be rhetorical relation  ( type ) and salient units of each span . 
The status , type , promotion set , and primary intention that are associated with each node in a discourse trec provide suflieient information for a full description of an instance of a tree structure  . Given the linear nature of text and the fact that we cannot predict in advance where the boundaries between various segments will be d  , ' awn , we should provide alnethodology that permits one to enumerate all possible ways in which a tree could bc built on the lop of a linear sequence of elementary discourse units  . The solution we use relies on tilesame intuition that constitute stile foundation of chart parsing : just as a chart parser is capable of consklering all possible ways in which different words in a sentence could be chlstered into higher-order grammatical units  , so our formalization is capable of considering all the possible ways in which different segments coukl be joined into discourse trees  . 
l , etspa , tLj , or simply\[i , j \] , denote a text span thai includes all tile elementary discourse unils between position i and j  . Then , if we consider a sequence of discourse units . u ~, It 2: .   .   . ~' lt~t , there are n ways in which spans o1' length one could be built , spa ' ~ Zl , l , s t ) ( tLt2 , 2 ,  ? ? ?  , ' sl ) ( t'/tn , n ; it-\] ways in which spans of length two could be built  , ? spa ~ zl , 2: Sl ) ~ Ut .   . &3~ .   .   .   , spalt n-l , n ;   11  --  2 ways in which spans of length three could be built  , and one 6"\]) ( t?l . l ; hSl ) ( tll . 2,4~  .   .   .  ~  . 5\]altn-2,n; .   .   . ; way in which a span of lengthn coukl be built , spa 771 , n . 
Since it is impossible to determine a priori the sl  ) ans that will be used to make up a discourse tree , we will associate with each span that could possibly become part of a tree a status  , a type , promotion , and primary intention relation and let discourse and intentional constraints determine the valid discourse trees  . In other words , we want to ? tetermine from the set of ha-( ,   ,   . -1)-t-(n-2) + .   .   . + 1 = n ( n4-1 ) / 2 potent M spans that pertain to a sequence of n discourse units  , the subse that adheres to some constraints of rhetorical and intentional wellformedness  .

For example , for the tree depicted in tigure 3 , some of the relations that hold are : , 5'(1 ,  2 , NUCLEUS ) , ,5'(3 ,  4 , SATELLITE ) ,   , 5" (1  , 3  , NONE ) . 
? T (1, h , relation_ua . rn . e ) provides the name of the rhetorical relation that holds between the text spans that are immediate subordinates  o1' span El , h\] in the discourse tree . If the text span is not used in the construction of the final tree  , the type assigned is NONE . For example , for the tree in ligure 3 , someo1' the relations that hold are : T(I , J , LEAF ) ,  5/'(1 , 2 , JUSTW ~ CATION ) , 
T (3,4, CONC ~ SSrON ), T (1, 3, NONE).

The collection of units for which the predicate is true provides the promotion set of a span  , i . e . , all units that are salient for that span . If span\[1 , h\] is not used in the tilml tree , by convention , the set of salient units is NONE . For example , for the tree in figure 3 , some of the relations that hold are : P (1 ,  1 . , &), P (1, 2, lh ), P (1, 3, NONE ), 1'(3, 4, D ,) .

3 . 2 An integrated formalization of RST and GST Using the ideas that we have discussed ill the previous section  , we present now a first-order formalization of discourse structures that makes use both of RST- and GST-like constraints  . In this lbrmalization , w c assume a universe that consists of the set of natural numbers fi'omJtON  , where N represents the number of textual units in the text that is considered  ; the set of names thai were defined by Mann and Thompson for each rhetorical relation  ; the set of unit names that are associated with each textual unit  ; and four exlra constants : NUCLEUS , SATEL-LITE , NONE , and LI~2AF . The formalization is assumed lo provide unique name axioms for all these constants  . 
The only funclion symbols that operate eve , " the assumed domain are them lditional + and - functions that are associated with the set of natural numbers and the oracle function J  )  . The formalization uses the traditional predicate symbols that pertain to the set of natural numbers  ( < ,  < ,  > ,  > ,  = , ?) and eight other predicate symbols : , 5' , T , P and I to account for the status , type , salienl units , and primary intention that are associated with every text span  ; vhel_velto account for the rhetorical rela-lions that hold between different extual units  ; position to account for the index of the textual units in lhetext dmtone considers  ; dorato account for dominance relations ; and s at precto account for satisfaction -precedence relations  . 
Throughout the paper , we apply the convention that all unbound variables are universally quantified and that variables are represented in lowercase italics " and constants in SMALL CAPITALS  . We also make use of the two extra relations , vclevaul_uni ~ and relevant_tel . 
For every text span span \[/ , hi , relevant_unit(l , h , u ) describes these to t'textual units that are relevant for that text span  , i . e . , the units whose positions in the initial sequence are numbers in the interval \[ l  , hi . It is only these units that can be used to label the pro-units in the interval \[ l  , hi . For every text span \ [1, h . \], v clev cm . Z_vcl(l , h , name ) describes the set of rhetorical relations that are relevant to that text span  , i . e . , the set of rhetorical relations that span over text units in the interval  \[1  , h\] and the set of extended rhetorical relations that span over text spans that cover the whole interval\[/  , h\] ( see ( Marcu ,  1996 ) for the formal delinitions of these re-httions . ) For example , fin " text (1) , which is descrihed formally in (2) and (4) , the following is the set of all rclc'~a ~ zl_rel and v clev ctn ~_ unil  , relations that hold with respect to text segment \[ l  , 3\]:vcl cvanLvcl(l , 3 , JUST WlCaTtON ) , ' rclcvanl_vcl(l ,  3 , EVII)ENC l0 , relevcr , t_m ~ it(I ,  3 ,  &)  ,   ,   . ~ z~v . , , t_~, , nit(l , a , B ~),, . d ~ , : . ,, z_,,,,it(l , : ~, q) . 
The constraints that pertain to the discourse trees that we formalize can be partitioned into constraints related to the domain of objects over which each predicate ranges  , constraints related to the structure of the tree , and constraints that relate the slruclt lral COlnponenl with the intentional component  . The axioms that pertain to the domains over which predicates  , 5 , P , and 7' range and the constraints related to the structure of the live are the same as those given by Marcu  ( 1996 )  . For lhesake of completeness , in this paper we only enumerate then \] informally  . In contrast , the axioms that pertain to intentions and the relation between structure and intentions are discussed in detail  . 
Constraints that concern the objects over which the predicates that describe every segment  \[1  , hi of a text structure range ( Mareu ,  1996 , pp .  1072-1073) . 
, , For every sire n\[/ , h\] , the set or objects over which predicate , 5' ranges is the set NUC 1A , ~ US , SNI'ELIJTI , \] , 
NONE).
? The status of any discourse segment is unique.
? For every segment \[ l , h\] , the set of objects over which predicate 7' ranges is the set of rhetorical relations that are relevant to that span  . 
? At most one rhetorical rdation can connect two adjacent discourse spans ? The primary intention of a discourse segment is either NONE or is a function of the salient units that pertain to that segment and of the rhetorical relation that holds between the immediate subordinated segments  . 
Since we want to stay within the boundaries of I irst-order logic  , we express this ( see formula ( 5 ) below ) by means of a disjunction of at most N sulf formulas  , which correspond to the cases in which the span has I  ,  2  .   .   .   . , or N salient raits . 44 Formula ( 5 ) reflects no preference concerning lheorder in which rhetorical relalions and intentions should be computed  ( Asher and Lascarides ,  1998) . It only asserts a consh'ailll on the two .

For every segmeut\[l , hi , the set of objects over which predicate Pranges is the set of units that make up that segment Constraints that concern/liestrnct mm of the discourse trees ? The status  , type , and promotion set that are associated with a discourse segment reflect the CO mlmsition-al ity criterion  . That is , whenever a rhetorical relation holds between two spans  , either a simihu " relation holds between I hemosl salic nlunits of those spans or an extended rhetorical relation holds between those spans  . 
? Discourse segments do not overlap.
? A discourse segment with status NONE does not participate in the tree at all  . 
? There exists a discourse segment , the root , that sirens over the entire text .

The dominance relations described by Grosz and Sidner hold Between the DSP of a discoors e segment and the DSP of ' its most immediate subordinated satellite  . This constraint is consistent with Moser and Moore's  ( 1996 ) discussion of RST and GST . In fact , this is not surprising if we examine the definitions of dominance relation given by Grosz and Sidner and satellite given by Mann and Thompson : a discourse segment purpose D  , 5' t?dominates a discourse segment purpose D , 5'1"1 if I ) , 5' P\]contributes to the satisfaction el'theI) , 5'1? . But this is exactly the role that satellites play in P  , ST : they do not express what is most essential for the writer's purpose  , but rather , provide supporting informa-lion that contributes to the understanding of the nucleus  . 

The relationship between Grosz and Sidner's dominance relations and Mann and Thompson's distinction between uclei and satellites is formalized by axioms  ( 8 ) and ( 9 )  .

Hence , axiom ( 8 ) explicates the relationship between the structure of discourse and intentional dominance  . In contrast , axiom ( 9 ) explicates the relationship between intentional dominance and discourse structure  . That is , if we know that the intention associated with span\[lj  ,  1 , 1\] dominates the intention associated with span \[12  , h , 2\] , then both those spans play an active role in the representation ad  , moreover , the segment\[12 , 11 , 2\] plays a SATELLITE role . 
? The satisfaction-precedencer dations described by Grosz and Sidner are parataetie relations that hold between arl fitrarily large textual spans  . Nevertheless , as we have seen in the examples discussed in this paper  , the fact that a paratactic relation holds between spans does not imply that there exists a satisfaction-precedencerlation at the intentional level between those spans  . Therefore , for satisfaction-precedence relations , we will have only On Eaxiom , that shown in ( I0) , below .

4 A computat iona l v iew o f the ax iomat i za t ion Given the formulation discussed a bovE  , tinding the discourse trees and the primary intentions lk wa text such as that given in  ( 1 ) amounts to finding a model for a first-order theory that consists of formulas  ( 2 )  ,  (4) , and the axioms enumerated in section 3 . 
There are a number of ways in which one can proceed with an implementation : for cxaln ple  , as m tight-forward choice is one that applies constraint-satisl'action techniques  , an approach that extends that discussed in ( Marcu ,  1996) . Given a sequence U of N textual units , one can take advantage of the structure of the domain and associate with each of the N  ( N-F1 ) / 2 possible text spans a status and a type variable whose domains consist in the set of objects over which the corresponding predicates  , 5+ and T , range . For each of the N ( N+1 ) /2 possible text spans \[ l , h . \] , one can also associate h , -l +\] promo-lion variables . These are boolean variables that specify whether units l  ,  1 + \ ]  ,   .   .   . , h belong to the promotion set of span \[/, hi . For each of the N ( N+1 ) /2 possible text spans \[ l , hi , one can also associate h- 1  +  2 intentional variables : one of the sew triables has as domain the set of rhetorical relations that are relevant for the span  \[1  , hi . 
The rest of the h -/+ 1 wwiables are boolean and specify whether unit l , lt-\] .   .   .   .   , or hare arguments of the oracle function f ~ that intentionally characterizes that span  . 
Hence , each text of N units yields a constraint -satisfaction prohlem with N  ( N+I ) (2N + \]3 ) /6 variables ( NCN q-\] ) (2N -- 13 ) / ( J = 2NC Nq-\] ) /~-- V , 2 <= NV , h <---- NI <= NW , h<=N(h_l_F2))) . ( h'--l+l ) + ~ l-1Z-,h . = lZ- , I = 1Z ~ , h = l The constl + aints associated with these w triables arc a one-to-on E mapping  o1' the axioms in section 3  . Finding the set of RS-trees and the intentions that are associated with a given discourse reduces then to/inding all the solutions for a traditional constraint-satisfaction problem  . 
5 Applications
Reasoning from text structures to intentions . Consider again the example text (1) , which was usEd throughout this paper . As we discussed in section 1 , il ' we assume that an analyst ( or a program ) determines that the rhetorical relations given in  ( 2 ) hold between the elementary units of the text , the rear clive valid trees that correspond to text  ( 1 )   ( see figure 1 )  . If we consider now the axioms that dEscribE the relationship bEtwEentext structures and intentions  , we can infer , for example , thai , for the tree I . a , the DSP of span \[ A1 , 131\] dominates the DSP of span\[cj , l ) j \] and that the primary intention of the whole text depends on unit  B1 and on the rhetorical relation of EVID\]\] NCF ,  . Ill such a casE , the axiomati-zation provides the means for drawing intentional inferences on the basis of the discourse structure  . Also , although there are live discourse structures that are consistent with the rhetorical judgments in  ( I )  , they yield only three intentional interpretations  , i . e . , there arc only three primary intentions that one can associate to the whole text  . One intention is that discussed above , which is associated with analysis I . a . Another intention depends on unit Bz and the JUSTIFICATION relation that holds between units  A1 and lh ; this intention is associated with the analyses hown in ligure  1  . c and l . e . And another intention depends on trait Bj and the JUSTIFICATION relation that holds between units l  ) j and Bj ; this intention is associated with the analyses hown in figure  1  . b and 1 . d . 
Reasoning fronltext structures to intentions can be also beneficial hia context such as that described by Lochbaum  ( 1998 ) because the rhetorical constraints can help prune the space of shared phms that woukl characterize an intEntional interpretation of a discou rse  . 

Using intentions lbrn mnaging rhetorical amlf iguities  . 
Assume now that besides providing . ivdgments concerning the rhetorical rehttions that hold between various units  , an analyst ( ot " a progran0 provides judglnents of intentions as well . If , lk+t"cxaml+le , besides the relations given in ( 2 ) a program determines that the DSP of span tAt , 1) 1\] dominates 111 oD SP of unit I/i , the theory that corresponds to these judgments and  111e axioms given in section 3 yields only two wdid text structures , those presented in \[ igure l . b and I . d . In this ease , the axiom-atization provides the means of using intentional judgments for reducing the ambiguity that characterizes the discourse parsing process  . 
hw estigating the relationship between semantic and intentional relations  . In their seminal paper , Moore and Polhtck ( 1992 ) showed lhat a text may be characterized by intentional and rhetorical analyses that are not isomorphic  . For example , for the text shown in (1I ) below , which is taken from ( Moore and Pollack ,  1992) , one may argue from an informational perspective that  A3 is a CONI ) ITION\['or B3 . However , l ' otll an intentional perspective , one may argue thai1' , 3 can be used to MOTI-VATI '; A3 . Similal+judgments can be made with respect to units  13 and c3  . Hence , lheset of relations that COln-pletely characterizes text  ( 11 ) is thal shown in ( 12 ) below .

Hence , our approach enables one to derive automatically and enumerate all possible rhetorical interpretations of a text and to study the rehttions hil~between structure and intentions  . Our approach does not provide yet the mechanisms for choosing between different interpretations  , but it provides the foundations for such a study . In contrast , Moore and Pollaek's informal approach could neither derive no renumerate all possible interpretations : in fact  , their discttssion refers only to the two trees shown in ligure  4  . a and . b . 
Unlike Moore and Polhtck's approach , where it is suggested that a discourse representation should reflect simultaneously both its information alnd intentional interpretations  , the approach presented here is capable of only enumerating these interpretations  . The formal model we proposed is not rich enough to accotllllllodate conctlrret H  , non-isomorphic interpretations .

6 Conclusion
Crucial totile develol mlent of syntactic theories was the ability to provide mechanisms capable of deriving all valid syntactic interpretations of a given sentence  . Semantic or corpusspecific nformation was then used to manage the usually large number of interpretations  . 
The work described in this paper sets theoretical foundations that enable a similar approach to the study of discourse  . The way a syntactic theory enables all wtlid syntactic trees of a sentence be derived  , the same way the axiomatization presented here enables all valid discourse trees of a text be derived  . But the same way a sylltac-tic theory may produce trues that arc incorrect ftonla semantic perspective for example  , the same way the ax-iomalization described here may produce trees that are incorrect when  , for example , focus and cohesion are factored in . 
Antmlber o1' researchers have a h'eady shown how individual rhetorical and intentional judgments can be derived automatically l'mm linguistic constructs uchastense and aspect  , certain patterns of pronominalization and anaphoric usages  , it-clefts , and discourse markers or cue phrases . But once lhese . iudgm cnts arc made , we still need to determine all discourse interpretations that are not only consistent with these judgments but also wtlid  . 
This paper provides mechanisms for deriving and enumerating all valid structure of a discourse and enables a quantitative study el ' the relation between text structures at ld intentions  .
