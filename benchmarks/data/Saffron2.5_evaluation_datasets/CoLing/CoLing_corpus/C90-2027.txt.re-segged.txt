1 Introduction
Syntactical robustness is a desired design pro -perry of natural language parsers  . Within the past decade , several developmental robustness approaches have been % rwarded : Syntax-free semantic passing  \[1\] co , ~lstraint relaxation after parse failure in a pattern matching  \[2\] or ATN framework \[:3  , 4\] , parse treefit tiug \[5\] and several non-formalized case frame approaches ( e . g . the parser series in \[6, 7\]) . Three approaches \[5 , 8 , 9\] account for special defectivities by extending grarnmatical coverage  . This paper refo , :mulates the socalled weakness approach , first , published in\[I0\] , which extends robustness to declarative parsing formalisms  . 
There are serious shortcomings in robustness research  , emerging fl'om the common view of robustness as a parsing and not as a representation problem  . Typically , two distinct representation levels for grammatical nd non-grammatical language are assumed  . The former is given by the basic fi'amework , the latter by relaxed pattern slots \[2\] or ATNarcre . sis\[3\] , by " non-grammatical " metarules\[4\] , by some construction specific strategies \[6 , 7\] or by the schema mechanism\[11\] . \ Virile formalism syntax is some t ; i-rues specified ( e . g .  \[4 , 10\]) , ~semantics of robust grmmnar formalisms , being m ' . cessa . ry to define these two representation levels , has not been given vet . Without a well-defined formalism semantics , it is impossible to predict the behaviour of a ( robust ) grammar fragment when applied to non-grammatical lnguage  . Therefore , no robustness methodology has been available untilllOW  , 2 The WACSG approach \ VACSG ( Weak A CSG ) is an experimental for-realism for defining robust grammars  , ACSG ( Annotated Constituent Structure Grammar ) is a class of two-level grammar formalism such as ?

Anyless metaphorical constrtlc-tion of the notion of weakness needs a conside-rable formal apparatus  . 
3 The WACSG Formalism
A WACSG gramma rule is a context Dee production annotated with an attribute-value -  ( av- ) formula . The following two subsections deal with weakness relations for contextfree grammars and av -languages  . Section 3 . 3 , then , sp , ~ci-ties the \\" ACSG formalism semanlics . 
3.1 Partial String Languages
Below (1) , three part , lidst , ring languages of a contextfree grammar G = < Cal , I . e , ~: , Pr , ,q's (~ > are defined , where Cat and Lcx are sets of nonter-rninal and terminal symbols  , respectively , Praset . of productions and >; set a set . of start symbols . Now let I'w a set of substrings of w and PP ~ a set of power-substrings of w with any ' w ~ E PP  , ~ resulting fl'om deletion of a . rbitrary subst , a'ings in w . If \[ w\]>0 , then t ~0 and P\]~) must not contain e . Z ~ and ZZw are partition flmetions in Pw and I ) t ~ respe ( : tiw qy . More simply , , ~'\]' 2T ((/) equa . lsL(G ) + . SUB ( ( J ) allows an undefined left side and/or right side snb string and PAI ~  ( G ) even undefined in fix substrings for every element from L  ( G )  . 

SET(G ) = eeen
L(G ) n
PAR(G ) = eIenL(G )
Partial string languages have appealing formal properties : ?  ( G ) for ? ESET , SUB , PAR is contextfree , contains c iffL ( G ) contains c and there is an order L ( G ) CSET ( a ) cSUB ( G ) c_PAR ( G )  . Nesting partial string languages introduces a set  ~  ( G ) of language such as e . g . SET(SUB(G )), SET(PAR(G)) . We have I ? ?( G ) l = 1, i . e . alie languages with maximal ope . rator ? are weakly equivalent , though not . 
pairwise strongly equivalent.
A recurs ? repartial string grarn mar ( RPSG ) is obtained by indexing rights ? de ( nonterminal ) symbols of acfgG with indices SET , SUB , or PAR . The formalism-semantics for an RP~G is given by a derivation relation  ( cf . \[15\] ) for non-indexed and SET-indexed nodes of a tree graph and by a generation function genas displayed in  2 for any other nodes . Let Q(G ) the set of derivations for a given G , wEQ(G ) a derivation and t wits tree graph . Let lw be a label function with l~o ( O ) 6Ssetinda ( possibly indexed ) start symbol ~ The languages L ( G )   ( derived language ) and RPSL ( G )   ( generated language ) are defined in . 3 . L ( G ) and RPSL ( G ) are contextfree and we have L ( G ) CRP SL ( G )  , L(G ) usually being much smaller than RPSL(G ) .

Soundness and completeness of 0 without E have been proven in \[16\]  . The predicate " E " introduces well-founded , distributive , recurs ? resets of attribute-value-structures , and is discussed in \[17\] . We assume the existence of a reduction algorithm RNF with RNF  ( A ) EO , iff is A satisfiable and RNF ( A ) = 2_ otherwise ( for any formula

Robustness in the area of av-languages i the ability to cope within consistent  ( i . e . overspeei-fled ) formulae . Two different methods for maintaining consistency will be considered  , namely set weakening and default formulae . 
3.2.1 Set weakening
In robustness theory , the purpose of av-sets is to weaken the flmction condition on dr-structures  . Set weakening may be used e . g . t br the transition from an inconsistent formula A = x  ( syn ) (case ) ~ nor a Ax ( syn ) (case ) ~ akk to a consistent ( therefore nonequivalent ) formula Ax ( syn ) (case ) = xl~nomAxa~akkAs1Ex ( syn ) (case ) A x2 C x ( syn ) (case )  . This U'ansi-tion preserves case information , but not inconsistency for the denot at mnJ\[x ~ . In general , set weakening is defined as follows: ( 4 ) Let AEcOa fonm flain disjunctive nor--mal form and t a nonconstant ten n  . Let . L?AAi,j . k It occur sk-times in a literal Ai . j a set of indices . For any rEL~t , zr is a variable not occuring in A . The set weakening of A for a term t is F or any A 6 cO and nonconstant term t it has been shown ( see\[17\] ) that , if RNF(A ) = A #? , then also DNF(At ) = RNF(A ~) #1 . Therefore , if A is satisfiable , then At is also satisfia-ble . Since satisfiability of A does not follow from satisfiability of A ~  ( see above )  , At is weaker-of equivalent to A . However , the theoretically motivated Aqnotation has not been integrated into WACSG formalism  , since set weakening can be achieved by using the predicate  "6"  . 
3 . 2 . 2 Dethu l ts r?he classical subsurnption ~_ gives a partial ordering within tile set of av-models  . There are , ho-wever , no inconsistent models . Therefore , a par-tiality notion within consistency must be based upon descriptions i  . e . av-formulae . The relation 3-partial _C 0 ~ is a subsumption-isomorphisrn into a ( canonical ) subset of 0 . The relation 0-partial defined below is still weaker in allowing inconsistency of one formula B and can be shown to be a superset of  3-partial   , i . e . 3-partial C_0-partial . 
Let I60 a conjunction of literals , and A , B6
CO . Then A0-partial B iff : 1 . RNF(AAI ) ? RNF(A)2 . RNF(AAI ) = RNF(B ), if RNF(B ) 7! 2
DNF(AAI ) = DNF(B ) otherwise 2157 a . leNF ( A ) ? Tile formula ICc ) may be restricted to be a conjunction of default literals  , whose predicate is marked with a . subscript a . This gives a default relation , which is a subset of a superset of subsumption between formulae  . A relation of default-satisfiability " l = a " may be based upon this default relation  . It is easy to demonstrate that a default-relation like this has some desired disambiguation properties : a disjunctive formula A =  A1   VA2 is reduced to RN . F ( A1 AI ) by conjoining it with a default formula IG 0 such that RNF ( A2AI ) = I . 
4 WACSG formalism se-mantics
For any WACSG-Grammar G , a domain D ( G ) and its subset SDDE ( G ) of strictly derivable domain elements is defined as follows  . Any domain element not in SDDE ( G ) bears weak-hess relations to a derivation coCQ ( G )   , where w(0) (1) GS sctind . Any formulaw ( i )   ( 2 )   ( 0 < ~ i <_ leo ) may be inconsistent . Now , a grammar G is called weak iff D(C ; )-SDDE(G ) ? O . 

Let ; C be a WACSG grammar , G 1~ the cf base of G and ~' ~ the cf part of a derivation wEf ~  ( G ) ? Let M be the set of av-mode ! s .

For every WACSG grammar G , ho-wever , there is an equivalent WACSG grammar G'without any partial string indices within it  . 
This grammar G'shows an extreme complexity already for a few indices in G  . This fact challenges the view ( see e . g .  \[8\] ) that robustness can be achieved by coverage x tension of any non-weakeable ACSG  . 
5 A WACSG-treatment of restarts in t ; his section , the WAC SG formalism is applied to restarts , a class of spoken language construe-tions , which is often referred to in robustness literature  \[2  , 3 , 4\] . A grammatical explanation , ho-wever , is still lacking . The German restart data in 7 are given with transliteration and segmentation . Constructions in 7 , 8 are ungrammatical , but not inacceptable .

From the viewpoint of robustness theory , arest-art < a/3AS ~7 , M > 6D ( G ) should not be in SDDE ( G ) exactly if it is defect , where G is a realistic WACSG fragment of the language in question  . Roughly , restarts are a kind of phrasal coordination ot allowing for deletion phenomena such as ellipsis  , gapping or left deletion . 
Additionally , the ~- substring ( i ) does not contribute to ( extensional ) meaning a of the construction and , ( ii ) , may show recursive defectivenes-ses such as contanfination and constituent break  ( examples 9 , 10) .

Under the coordination hypothesis , a parallelism between defective and non-defective restarts is assumed  . Right-recursive coordination of defective and nondefec-tive conjuncts is unrestricted  . In 11 , equation si-mulating semantic and syntactic projections  ( see\[18\] ) " controlup " the syntactic but not , the semantic description of afl conjunct in a restart construction  .

Within a simulated projection theory , controlling down a verbal argument into a v comp -embedded element of a  . nav-set requires a complex regular term x ( syn ) +\[  ( vcomp ) (syn )  +\]* , which is expensive to compute . Therefore , rules 16 , 18 introduce an additional term x(kosem ) , such that \[\[ ; c ( ko sem ) \]\] is the semantic structure of a set Ix\]of openly coordina-tedav  . -structures . By default satisfiability of x ( sem ) ~ dx ( ko sem )  , \[\[ x ( sem ) ~ equals ~\[ x ( ko sem ) ~ except if \[\[ x ~ is the avset of a non -restart coordination  . 
Since defectivity , e.g . a constituent , break.
may render incomplete the flverbal phrase incomplete  , rule 17 provides semantic default values for every possible semantic argument  . 
l)istribut . edav formulae may be necessary for one conjunct but inconsistent with  ( the description of ) the other . This situation ma . y arise due to contamination of the first : ( fl- ) conjunct . Independently it can be shown that contaminations almost exclusi-vely affect syntactic  ( as opposed to semantic ) t  ~ atures . Now , if the conditions coherence and completeness ( ee\[11\] ) are deti-ned on semantic structure , syntactic coherence can be inforced by lexicalized formulae as shown in  19 that depend on a syntactic defectivity feature ~ x  ( syn ) (defec ) \]  ( 14 ) A'IOCpAI . i -- ~ , I ) et AC e

6 Conclusion
The reformulation of robustness theory as a theory of weak grammars  ( and , consequently , of robust parsing as parsing of weak grammars ) has enabled both the specification of working par -sets  \[17\] and a substantial explanation of non-gl ' ammatical langua  ; ge . Further study has to be done . Cross-linguistl cresear & on defective con-st . ructions(e , g . non-grammatical elipses ) and a default logic ma~oching methodological standards of  A1 theory remain important desiderata ,  . Our prediction hat there is no strong theory of de-fectiveness  , however , invites for falsification .
