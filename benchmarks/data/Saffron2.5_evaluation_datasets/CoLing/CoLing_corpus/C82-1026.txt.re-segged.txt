The DAISY/ALIBABA-system developed within the WAl -project represents both a specific solution to the automatic indexing problem and a general framework for problems in the field of natural language processing  , characterized by fuzziness and uncertainty ? The WAI approach to the indexing problem has already been published \  [3  \ ]  ,  \ [5\]  . This paper however presents the underlying paradigm of recognizing abstract objects  . The basic concepts are described , including the decision theory approach used for recognition  . 
1 THE"WAI"AND THE " AIR " PROJECT 1
The DAISY/ALIBABA system\[1\] ,  \ [2 \ ]  ,  \ [3 \ ]  , as developed at the Technical University Darmstadt analyses abstracts and describes them according to the coordinate indexing philosophy using a prescribed set of descriptors  . To perform this task , a domain dependent dictionary is needed . Estimating the non-existence of suitably sized dictionaries to be one of the main problems for research and development of automatic indexing \   [4  \ ]  , in 1978 the WAI project started with dictionary construc-tion  . The two completed dictionaries are ? FST , covering the scope of food science and technology  3 and ? PHYS , covering the scope of Physics , a part of INIS ( International Nuclear
Information ? ystem ) 4.--
Different procedures for generating dictionary data were developed and applied  . 
To classify them and to unify the created data is one of the main tasks of diction-ary construction  ( described in detail in\[3\] ,  \ [4 \ ] )  . This cannot be done without examination of the i rinfluence on the quality of the resulting indexing  . To perform indexing tests , the development of DAISY and ALIBABA was another important objec-tive of WAI  . 
Indexing results are reported in \[4\] ,  \ [5 \ ]  , \[6\] which are based on consistency tests only , using the manual indexing as a standard . To confirm or to modify these results , the AIR project is now preparing a retrieval test on the physics database INKA-PHYS of the Fach informations zent rum FIZ  4   ( Energie , Physik , Mathematik ; Karls-ruhe ) ( order of magnitude : I0 . 000 documents , 200 search requests ) . The indexing will be based upon the new dict ionary  PHYS-2 which is to be constructed using about 80  . 000 documents of the INKA-PHYS database . 
2 THE BASIC PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING THE " WAI"/"AIR " APPROACH The WAI/AIR approach represents both a specific solution of the indexing problem and a general framework for a wide class of problems within natural language processing and other fie lds  . 
This paper will only give reference to details of the particular solution publi-shed elsewhere  . The objective of this work is to present the general framework derivable from the basic principles underlying the WAI and the AIR project  :   ( I ) Knowledge bases are very important for problem solving  . But to presuppose knowledge for an automatic system must not question its applicability  , caused by nonexistent procedures for construction of knowledge bases of an indispensable size  . The realistic appropriate solution is the main aim rather than a perfect one  . 
(2 ) Controlling the quality and expenditure of effort of a system must not wait until it is put into practice  . System development has to be guided by a control derivable from the task to be performed  ,   ( 3 ) The algorithms that make the bases of the procedure should not be assumed to be perfect  . Applied to complex tasks , it is a fundamental fact that they are based on simplified models  . 
The principles can be considered to be a guideline for designing application oriented systems  . With good reason it is claimed that the quality of such a system can be determined by evaluation in application environments only  ( see for example \[7\] ,  \[8\]) . This cannot be done without empirical studies of the user-system interaction  . 
The paradigm of recognizing abstract objects presented here is an approach to integrate the evaluation aspect into system development  . It is also an approach to problems , for which no perfect solutions exist or seem to be applicable  . 
3 RECOGNITION OF ABSTRACTOBJECTS 3 . 1 THE DEFINITION OF THE RECOGNITION TASK The basic idea is to use the application environment its e lf to get an implicit description of the problem  . Whenever talking about a particular application environment there is no other way then to take a conceptual model ME as a basis which determines the adequate concepts  ( see\[9\] , or see also \[1015) . 
Here , a conceptual model has to be formulated in this way  , that it defines ( abstract ) objects ( x , k ) , ~ EX , k  ~ K . ~ denotes those aspects of an object which can be observed directly with regard to the problem  , K denotes a set of object classes . A model mE of the application environment gives an implicit definition of the  ( recognition ) problem , by forming a continuous stream of abstracts objects  . 
To develop a recognition system ( RS ) is nothing more than the finding of a suitable mapping e : x ? e  ( x ) that recognizes an actual x to be ( x , e(x )) . 
If the RS-mE interface is identical to the system -user interface  , then mE may refer to the user's judgement directly  , to define the cooccurrence of ~ and k . 
RECOGNITION OF ABSTR ACTOBJECTS 163
This is also adequate , whenever human cognitive capabilities are to be simulated  . 
We give some examples : ? Information retrieval can be based upon recognition of document-query relationships  ( described in \[6\] )  . ~ can be represented by ( d , f ) where d denotes the document , f denotes the query , k may be in the most simple case a member of the set is relevant  , is not relevant , refering to the user's judgement ? ? Expressions , possibly within the scope of a quantifier as well as hypotheses for inferences  , can both be regarded as abstract objects . Determining the scope of a quantifier or drawing inferences can be based on the recognition of those objects by simulating human decisions ? Two other examples are given-avoiding the simulation approach : ? Complex tasks often require the testing of many hypotheses  , which can be regarded as abstract objects , mE may refer to the final results of the processing  . 
? In \[6\] a decision theory approach to optimal retrieval forms a basis form E  , defining the task of indexing as recognition of document-descrip to relation-ships ?  3  . 2 STRUCTURE OF THE RECOGNITION SYSTEM The structure of the recognition system as presented here makes evident tbat the recognition problem arises essentially at the interface of two models : ? The  ( external ) conceptual model ME defining the recognition problem  . 
? The ( internal ) conceptual model MI used to describe the object with respect to the recognition task  . 
MI is part of the recognition system ( Figure 1) . It structures the object using the knowledge base  , so that all available aspects that may influence the decision of the RS are included  . In many cases it also initiates the recognition process  , i . e . it constructs the hypothesis , represented by the object . 
According to MI a formal description x of ~ is produced  . We do not consider here ' the nature of MI , that can be a sophisticated one with a strong theoretical foundation as well as a rather simple and heuristic one  . Different models MI might cause quite different recognition systems for the same task  . The main point is , that MI leads to an object description instead of a decision  . Another point is , that both models ME and MI are essentially independent ? This fact causes every  164 G , KNORZ objects ll ; lset of . ~ describing deciding ~ object classes

Figure 1 The recognition system and its environment system RSMI-provided it is a deterministic one-to make incorrect decisions in some cases  . That means , an ' optimal recognition systems ' cannot be defined without taking the number of cases causing faults into consideration or-more precisely-the statistical properties of the application environment represented by m E  . The desision theory approach appropriate to the given situation is descri-bed in \  [5\] and \ [6\ ] with respect to the indexing problem . The approach requires that every single decision of RS is classified  . This task is for the most part anti-cipated by ME  , which defines the set of object classes K . K determines the scope of possible faults . Those can be weighted independently by a loss function c :  ( e ( x )   , k ) + w . With the model mE given , a particular recognition system will cause an expected value E  ( w )  . The optimal system RS ~! tvp is the result of searching for this Rs MIE  ( w )  . It can be shown that the optimal decision RS~t ( x ) can which minimizes
W be based on the restricted probabilit i esp  ( klx )   . The mapping sek ( x ) = p ( klx ) can b ( approximated by polynomial functions to be constructed automatically using a sample of objects  ( ~ , k ) . This way has been choosen by the ALIBABA system , that uses polynomial classifiers , adapted in the mean square sense\[11\] . The indexing results in \ [5\] and \[6\] demonstrate that-applied to the indexing problem-the recognition approach and in part icular the method of approximation is adequate for the problem  . 
4 DISCUSSION
The approach of recognizing abstract objects is evaluated using the paradign fautomatic indexing  . The model ~ , IE refers-for practical reasons-not to the
RECOGNITION OF ABSTRACTOBJECTS 165 retrieval process but to the decisions of human indexers  . If a consistency factor ( comparing manual and automatic indexing ) measures the quality of automatic indexing , the set K requires two elements only . If a more sophisticated evaluation is intended , the set K can be increased , according to the kind of faults that should be considered  . The classification of faults can for example depend on the descriptor under consideration  . 
For the model MI used see for example \[5\] and \[12\]  . 
We summarize the essentials of the suggested approach  ( the first point refers in particular to the indexing paradigm  )  . 
- The recognition problem causes one to regard two independent models : one with respect to retrieval and one with respect to analysis of abstracts  . This point of view is important for an approach to optimal indexing  \[6  \] , but it is not self-obvious . In \[14\] the retrieval oriented approach of Robertson and the indexing oriented approach of Harter  \[13\] are brought together . The result is a one model approach like also other approaches in this field  ( for example \[15\] )   . 
-The internal model MI is restricted to the base of the decision to be made  . 
This fact makes it very easy to additionally include a lot of knowledge and heuristic procedures  , that might play a role only for decision making . There is no risc of causing faults by determining how to compute the decision  , using this knowledge . Artificial intelligence approaches use a correspondant model MI to determine the decision  \[1G\]  . 
-The need for a model mE implies an educational aspect with respect to evaluation  . 
ensures , that the gap between the optimal system RsM~t and the ideal mE system  ( equivalent tomE ) is . under control .
