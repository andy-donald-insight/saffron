Many attempts have been made to use traditional dictionaries in order to assign word senses to general semantic ategories  , cf .  \[1\] . 
Our LDB contain semantic information that cannot be elicited from the existing dictionaries  . The priority is given to semantic features influencing lexieal or grammatical cooccurrence  . In this paper possibilities are discussed of predicting selection ~ l restrictions  , syntactic features and other formal characteristics of the utterance-such as the array of arguments and their semantic interpretation  , the meaning of an a speetual form of a verb etc . , - on the basis of semantic features of a word in the lexicon  . 
The main advantage of a lexicai database as compared with a traditional dictionary consists in the fact that a database makes it possible to present semantic information in a format enabling the computer to locate efficiently various types of information specified for a given class of words  . To put it differently , the main advantage of a database consists in the possibility of compiling lists of words possessing a common feature or a set of features  . 
There are three main principles that the system is based upon  . 
1 . We are convinced that semantic features of words determine cooccurence to a much greater extent han it is usually acknowledged  . 
In other words , we claim that many aspects of syntactic subcategorization flexical items are predictable from their meaning  . 
2 . A semantic feature of a word is essentially a semantic omponent  ( or components ) in its lexieographic definition . 
3 . A great amount of information about the meaning of a lexical unit  ; about its combinatory possibilities ; prosody ; referential features ; or about its regular ambiguity , need no the stored in the dictionary : this information belongs to wi~at may be called a grammar of lexicon and should be formulated in a generalized form  . In this formit can be stored in a Lexical Knowledge Base of semantic and syntactic regularities  . This Knowledge Base has not yet been designed , but semantic features of words in LDB are conceived as an input for general rules that will be stored in this hypothetical Knowledge Base  . 
2 Lex ica l Database for Con-c re te Nouns There are different layers of lexicon that require specific formats of a database  , and the choice of the format is one of the main problems of database formation  . 
In what follows we list domains in the Lexical Database for Concrete Nouns-one of the components of Lexicographer  , now implemented in a working program ~ Each domain is interpreted as a feature that can take a definite set of values  . 
Domain I . Morphological and syntactico-

1 . 2 . Animate/Inanimate 1 . 3 . \]) eclension and accentuation . 
All the other domains contain semantic in formation  . We do not mean that the system of semantic features wouhl provide a word with an exhaustive texicographic delinition-this is not the appropriate task for a lexical database  . 
Ti repurpose of a database is to highligh those semantic aspects of a word that unite semanti eally cognate words and differentiate many of semantically different words from one another  . 
Inothe . r words , lexical database is an instrument of predicting and calculating all sorts of use fifl semantic lasses of words  . 
Domains ILl and II . 2 specify Mereologie M status of a word ( more precisely , of a lexeme-namely , of a word taken in one of its lexical meanings ) . The w dues of the feature I1 . 1 may be : PART , SET or WII ( ) LE . In the later case dommn 11 . 2 is emtrty while in the tlrst two cases it specifies the WIIOLE for the PART and the ELEMENT for the SI '  ; T:I'ART(SI' ; T ) of what ? E . g . , (1) kry lo ' all '

I ) omain 1\[ . 3 provides a lexeme with a tax-onumic supercategory  , such as Person , Plant , Animal , M et al , Building , Sp here of activity etc . 
Tiffs domain is of primary importance arrdit is tlds domain that defines the most interesting classes of concrete \]  exenle8  . The systen l of taxonomic categories h ~ a hierarchical structure  . 
Thus , the possibility is provided to state imo plieative  ( lelmndencies between categories , so that the lower category inherits all the information from the category of a higher \[ rwel  . E . g . , T . eategol'y ( os obnj ak ' private residence ' ) = dora'h < ) use ' ; T-category(dora)-postrojka ' building ' ; T-category ( postrojka ) sooruzenie ' construction ' . 
Thus , lexeme os obnjak will be assigned not only to the class of houses but ~ d so to the class of lmildings and to the class of constructions  . 
Domain II . 4 specifies a Predicate semantically connected with the noun in question  . It turns out that such predicates occupy then r ( )st prominent place in lexicographic definitions of a great majority of concrete nouns  . Usually these are predicates that determine a standard way in which the corresponding object is used ACRESDE  COLING-92  , NAN'rE . S , 2328^ot;r19921297 PROC . O1: COLING-92, NAturEs , AUG . 2328,1992 ( functional predicates):
Predicate ( house ) = to live
Predicate ( chair ) = to sit
Predicate(goblet ) = to drink . There are also nouns that imply a nonfunctional predicate in ttteir lexicographic definition-a predicate that determines its characteristic property  , cf . 
Predicate ( liquide ) = to flow.
Some nouns require predicates of both types , cf.
Predicate ( cellar ) = 1) to store products ; 2) digged under the floor of a house . 
For some classes of nouns Domain 1 . 4 Predicate is empty , e . g . , for some ( not all ! ) names of the socalled natural classes and for the names of parts of the corresponding objects  , cf .

Inclusion of predicates into a lexicographic definition of concrete nouns may be considered an attempt of ertilize theoretical lexicography with the ideas of frame semantics  . 
Domain II . 5: Predicate may have a Restriction as for the range of possible taxonomic classes of its arguments  , e . g .

The Database for Concrete Nouns is ready for demonstration  . The database for verbs and a sma21 base for pronouns are in ' a stage of preparation . 
3 Combinabi l i ty predictions for concrete nouns Here are some examples of how semantic information contained in the database can be used to predict syntactic regularities  . 
Example 1 . As was stated earlier , domains II . 1, II . 2 define the following relations : 1) PARTWHOLE ; 2) SET-ELEMENT . 
There are propositions that differentiate these two relations  ; thus , combinations in ( a ) , with PARTWHOLE relation are possible with a preposition U  , while combinations in ( b ) , with a SET-ELEMENT relation , are not : a . nozka'leg'Ustula'chair ' pugovica ' button 'U palj to ~ coat ' b  . * chaschka'cup'Userviza'service '* korova ' cow'Ustada'her d'ACTESDE  COLING-92  , NAr , rrEs . 2328 ^ ot~'r19921298 Paoc . ol , COLING-92, NANTES . AUG .  2328 , 1992 Note that Genitiw ~ C~uuecanl ) e used to express both relations . 
Example 2 makes use of the domain f ) redicate : it is the predicate implied by a lexico-gr ~ l  ) hic definition of a nounth ; Lt deterinine , ill very in any eases , the exact interpretation f the Genitive construction with a concrete noun ~ a heard  . 
Thus , a noun gnez do eaest'h : usa possessive valency gnezdo or laChest of an eagle '  , chjognez do ? ~ whose nest ' ,  \[ ) ccaus c of the predicate ~ to liw ~' included in the lexicographic deft-nition of gnez do'nest ' has an unbounded variable : who lives ? On the other hand  , for such a noun as professor ' professor ' Genitive con  . 
struction realizes its object valency , ef . professorinatenlatiki'professor of mathematics  '  , be . 
cause of the l ) re(licat (* ~ to study ' , included in its lexicographic detinition ; an unbounded variable here corresponds to the object wdency : studies what ? 
Examples of this kind are , ~ bundant.
To stunup , the following aspects of the proposed type of a semantic dictionary are of primary illl portance  . 
1 . The fact that information is presented in the for ill of a  ( latal n~se , which provides the fit-cility of compiling all sorts of \[ exical lists  . 
2 . intensive use of T-categories ( and other re . -current semantic features ) , which gives semantic explications for combinability restrictions  . 
3 . l ) ivision of lexical information into two parts - Lexical Data Ba  . sea ~ ndl , exic M Knowledge Base , which widens the range of possible lexicographic gener Miz ~ ttions  .
