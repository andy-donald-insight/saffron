2 Two Versions of the Centering

Ct , later their grammatical properties which are considered to reflect their degrees of salience  . The centering theory specifies the following ( heuristic ) rule : If the Cb of the current sentence is the same as the Cb of the previous sentence  , a ( zero ) pronoun should be used . 
There are two versions of the centering theory that have been applied to Japanese zero pronoun resolution : Kameyama's  ( Kameyama , 1986) and Walker's ( Walker et al ,  1994) . Roughly both versions use the following same forward center ranking for Japanese : 
Topic > Empath y > Subject > Object2 > Object > Others , where Empathy is a grammatical property that indicates the speaker's position in describing a situation  . In addition to the above rule , Kameyama's version uses the property sharing constrain that two zero pronouns in adjacent sentences  , which co-specify the same Cb , should share one of the grammatical properties . This constraint is used for ranking discourse ntities in the order of preference as the antecedent of a zero pronoun  . 
Walker's version , on the other hand , uses the following additional rules and constraint : ? Constraint 
For each sentence Ui :
The center , Cb(Ui ) , is the highestranked element of CI ( \[7/-1 ) that appears in Ui . 
? Rules
For each sentence Ui : 1 . If a certain element of CI ( Ui-1 ) appears as a ( zero ) pronoun in Ui , then so is

2 . Transition states are ordered , where the transition state is determined based on two factors : whether Cb of the current sentence is the same as of the previous sentence  , and whether Cb is the same as the highestranked member of CI of the current sentence  . This transition ordering is used for ranking discourse entities in the order of preference as the antecedent of a zero pronoun  . 
Basically , when the centering algorithm is used for the ( zero ) pronoun resolution , the algorithm first generates all possible antecedents for  ( zero ) pronouns in a sentence by enumerating all possible Ct  , and C\]pairs for the sentence , and then filters and ranks these possible antecedents with the constraint and rules that are mentioned above  . The Cb of the sentence is computed as the side effect of performing the  ( zero ) pronoun resolution . 
3 P rocess ing Complex Sentences with the Centering Theory In the centering theory that we outlined in the last section  , ' sentence ' , that is its basic unit of processing , means the simple sentence that contains only one predicate  ( verb )  . The centering theory , therefore , has not adequately addressed the way to handle complex sentences that contain n mltiplc verbs  . However , it is necessary to handle complex sentences that are prevalent in naturally occurring discourses with the centering algorithms  . 
We can think of ( at least ) two ways to handle complex sentences . For instance , consider processing a complex sentence of the form ' SXConjSY  , ' where SX and SY each consists of a simple sentence and Conj is a conjunctive lement  ( Suri and McCoy ,  1994) 1 . One can imagine processing SX first and then SY as if they are a linear sequence of simple sentences and applying the centering theory to each sentence successively and updating the data structures for centering  . 
On the other hand , the whole sentence can be treated as a single unit  . This approach , however , has two problems . First , the intrasentential ellipsis that the antecedent exists in the same sentence  9 cannot be handled with the centering theory , because the centering theory only handles the intersentential elipsis  . Therefore , the intrasentential elipsis must be dealt with separately from the intersential elipsis  . Secondly , in the centering theory , it is unclear whether two zero pronouns with the same grammatical property in the different simple sentences  ( of a complex sentence ) can be simultaneously handled without any extension to the original theory  . 
Comparing these two approaches , we adopt the former . And if a sentence contains multiple verbs , we partition it into multiple simple sentences and apply the centering theory to a sequence of p ~ r-titioned simple sentences individually for the zero pronoun resolution  . Using this approach , we need not modify the original centering algorithm drastically to handle complex senteimes  . Even the intrasentential elipsis can be handled with the centering theory  , because different simple sentences contain the antecedent and the zero pronoun respectively  , after partitioning . 
a . 1 The range of search for the antecedent Since the centering theory uses only the infor-nmtion in the previous and current sentences  , this might be problematic when we adopt the ' partition ' approach  . \] ebrexample , if the previous sentence consists of three simple sentences  , 1In case of Japanese , it is a conjunctive postposition . 
2Of course , the antecedent does not exist in the same simple sentence  . 
872 tile firs ( ; simple sentence in tile previous seil-tence become stile third from the  , current sentence , after partitioning . Partitioning might cause that , the information in the previous and current ( post-partitioned simple ) sentences does not in-chide eventile information in the current  ( pre-partitioned ) sentence . We tilink it is inadequate , since the antecedents of zero pronouns often appear in the previous  ( pre-partitioned ) sentence . 
Therefore , it ; is necessary to extend the range of search for ( ; he antecedent to more previous ( post-partition e . d simple ) sentences . 
To determine to what extent we should extend the range of search for the antecedent  , we make the following investigations and e . xperiment : ? How many simple sentences does a naturally occurring sentence consist of ?? How many sentences from the current seil-tence do we find timan tecedent of a zero I  ) ro-noun in real discourses ? ? How doestile accuracy of tile zero pronoun resolution change if we vary the range of simple sentences where the antecedent of a zero pronoun is searched ? The first investigation is l  ) ertormed manually , and the result shows that 10 , 0 00 sentences of the review articles from the newspaper consist of  24  , 332 simple sentences . Therefore , a naturally occurring Japanese sentence can be considered to consist of  2  . 0 2 . 5 simple sentences on average . 
The second investigation is performed manually on one of tile test discourses that are inentioned in the next section  , and the result shows that 95% of the antecedents appear in the previous or current  ( pre-partitioned ) sentence , This result is consistent with the larger-scale investigation that l % l-j is awa et al  ( l % j is awa et al , : 1991) made . for tile same purpose . Fnj is a wa's investigation , on 1 , 087 sentences of the scientific journal and 1 , 4 26 sentences of the review articles from the newspaper  , showed that 87 . 6% of the antecedents appeared in the previous or current sentence and  95  . 1% appeared ill tile previous two sentences or current sentence  . The third experiment is performed on two of the test discourses in the next section  , by implementing two versions of the centering algorithms that are mentioned in the hast section antiwn ' yingtim range of simple sentences where the  . 
antecedent of a zero pronoun is searched from tile previous sentence to the previous ten sentences  . 
Tile experiment shows that the accnraey improves until the previous  2   4 sentences are searched , but degrades after that . 
Totally taking into account these results , we determine that tile antecedents are searched in the previous four simple sentences  . Since the antecedent tends to appear in the closer sentence to ~ hezerot  ) ronoun , as 141j is a wa's investigation idi-cates , we detern fine the following forward center ranking among the Cfs of tile previous four simple 
Sell tences : c > > > c , where C~represents the CI of the nth silnple sentence froln the current sentence  . 
3 . 2 Tak ing into account the in fo rmat ion of emdunetive postpositions Even if the antecedents are searched in the previous tour simple sentences  , imple ~ partition ' approach might not yield good performance  , because tile information of conjunctive postpositions that are between two adjacent simple sentences in ot taken into account  . For exmnple , consider the following sentences : ( a ) Tarowa is syouken meibenk you site it a . 
(b ) Jirogakoe wokaketemo , kizukanakatta.
These sentences are partitioned into the folh ) wing simple , sentences : ( a ) Tarowa is syouken meibenk you site it a . 

Taro was studying tmr(i.
(bl ) Jiroga ( (/5ni ) koewokaketelno,
Subj Conj
Although Jirocalled out to him , (b2X ?: tga )( (/) ~ ui ) kizn kanakatta . 
he did not noticeilim.
Here (/5 represents a zero pronoun . Applying the.
centering algorithm to timse sentences , tile process becomes as follows: ( a ) : C ~=\[ T ,   . ' o \] , C~-\['?\]a(bl ) :</ 5=Taro , Cf =\ [ Jiro , Taro \] ,  6% =
Taro(b2):4)1 = , liT " o , (/52 = Taro , Cf =\[ , lifo , Taro \] , G , = Taro Therefore , the counterintuitive interpretation that ' Jiro did not notice Taro ' is obtained  . 
Since two adjacent simple sentences in a complex sentence are combined together by the conjunctive postposition that indicates the relationship between the ln  , using the intorination of the conjunctive postposition might iln provetim per-tormanee of the zero pronoun resolution  . 
To clarify how tile zero pronoun resolution relies on the intormation of conjunctive i  ) ost positions , we pertor in the investigation whether tile noun phrases with the same grammatical property agree in two adjacent simple sentences that have a conjunctive postposition tmtweentimm  , by extracting sentences with conjunctive postpositions Dora the revie  , w articles in the newspaper and enmnerating the agreement and disagreement  . The enulnera-lion is performed in cases where both sentences haw  ; zero pronouns and only e . it her sentence has a The first sentence in a discourse has no Ca  . 
873 a zero pronoun . Twelve main conjunctive postpositions are investigated  . The result of the investigation is quite similar to the Yoshimoto's and Mi-natal's investigations  ( Yoshimoto , 1986; Minar et ,  1974 ) that classify the conjunctive postpositions into three classes :  , , Class A : ' nagara ' (' while ') , ' tart '(' and ') , ' tutu'('while ') , ' te ' ( ' and ' ) 4 If two sentences have a conjunctive post ; po-sition of class A between then : , the subject noun phrases tend to coincide , in both cases where both sentences have zero pronouns and only either sentence has a zero pronoun  . 
? Class B :' temo ' (' although') , ' node ' (' because ') , ' non)'('although') , ' keredo '(' although ') , ' ba'('if') , ' kara'('because ') , ' to ' ( ' when ' ) If two sentences have a conjunctive postposition of class B between them  , the antecedent tends to be not the subject of the other sentence  , in case where only either sentence has the zero pronoun of the subject position  . In case where both sentences have zero pronouns , tile agreement/disagreelnent depends on the context and doe  . snot have any tendency . 
? Class C :' ga'('but')
Tile agreement/disagreement dpends on tile context and does not have any tendency  . 
LFrom this result of the investigation , we determine to apply to the zero pronoun resolution the following heuristics that are concerned with conjunctive postpositions  . Since conjunctive postpositions of class A have a strong preference that two subjects in adjacent sentences tend to coincide  , instead of the centering alger ) thin , we use this preference t brtile zero pronoun resolution in the simple sentence after the conjuimtive postpositions of class A  , and try to find the antecedents of zero pronouns in the same position of the adjacent sentence  , if any . In this case also , the center of the current sentence is computed similarly to the ordinary algorithm  , and the antecedent of the zero pronoun becomes the Cb of tile current sentence  . 
In case of conjunctive postpositions of class B , the antecedent tends to lie not the subject of the other sentence if one of tile sentences has the zero pronoun of the subject position  . We think this tendency in ) plies that noun phrases in the sentence before the conjunctive t  ) ostt ) ositions of class B tend to be not the antecedents of zero pronouns in the next sentences  . Therefore , we give these noun phrases the least t ) reference as the antecedents , although the . zero pronoun resolution is perforlned by the original centering algorithm  . 
4In parentheses , we show the direct translation of conjunct ; ive postpositions into English . 
Since conjunctive postpositions of class C have no preference for the antecedents of zero pronouns  , the zero pronoun resolution is performed as usual . 
Consider again the following sentences : ( a ) Tarowa is syouken meibenk you site it a . 

Taro was studying hard.
(bl ) liroga(?ni ) koewelm ketemo,
Subj Conj
Although Jirocalled out to hiln , (b2) (051 ga ) (?2eli ) kizu kanakatta . 
he did not notice him.
If the original centering algorithm is applied to each sentence uniformly  , the counterintuitive interpretation is obtained , as mentioned above . 
Taking into account the ilflbrmation of conjunctive postpositions and applying the above heuristics to the points  , since ( bl ) and ( l/2 ) have the conjunctive postposition of class B , ' temo ' (% l-though') , between them , the noun phrases it : sentence ( bl ) have the least preference and the order of C ~ , ix ) the sentence ( bl ) become stile opposite to the case of the original centering algorithm  . 
Therefore , the antecedents of tile zero pronouns in sentence  ( b2 ) are identified as follows : ci = C , , - F \] ( bi ) : ? = T , , ,  . o , C , = Ji, . o \], C , ,
Taro(t/2): ( fit--Taro , e/52 = , \]iro , Cl =\ [ Taro , Jiro \] , Ct , = Taro Here this interpretation that ' Taro ( lid not notice
Jiro ' fits our intuition.

After partitioning COlnplex sentences into inultiples in li  ) le sentences , it searchestile ~ mtecedents in the previous four simple sentences  , instead of only a previous sentence . Secondly , it ; takes into account the information of conjunctive postpositions that are between two sinlple sentences  , by classifying them into three classes .

Purthermore , the effectiveness of her work is not evaluated with real discourses  . 
Takada's work ( T&kad and Doi ,  1994 ) might be the only exception that proposes the zero pronoun resolution method based on the centering theory and evaluates its effectiveness with real discourses  . 
Since he handles not only zero pronouns but also overt pronouns  , the exact comparison is difficult , but his approach , that is based on Kameyama's approach , yields the performance of 74 . 8% if the results for overt pronouns are excluded . In addition , to handle complex sentences , he adopts the other approach where they are treated as a single unit  , and admits that some problems arise because of this approach  . 
Taking into account the information of conjunctive elements in the pronoun resolution reminds us of the works that use the establishment of coherence relations between clauses for pronoun reso -lution  ( Hobbs , 1979; Kehler ,  1993) . They try to establish coherence relations by the costly inference  , while we use only the surface information . 
5 Conclusion
In this paper , we presented a simple method to handle complex sentences with the centering theory and described our framework that can identify the antecedents of zero pronouns in naturally occurring Japanese discourses  . We also presented tile evaluation of our framework with real discourses  , although the evaluation is not so largescale to asser the effectiveness of our framework  . 
Our simple method yielded the accuracy of 78% for the zero pronoun resolution . 
Since our method that is presented in this paper is based on the centering theory and basically uses only syntactic information  , we plan to incorporate the semantic on straints hat filter anomalous antecedents for zero pronouns  , and take into account the global structure of discourses  . We think the preliminary results of our system in this paper are promising since incorporating the information of semantic on straints and the global structure of discourses will improve the performance  .
