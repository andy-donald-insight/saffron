2 ALT-J/E : A Brief Overview
ALT- . I/E , the Automatic Language Trlmslator : Japanese to English  , is one of the most & dvitll ( : ( d and well-recognized systems for translating , htpanese to English . It is the largest such system in terms of the iu nount of knowledge it compris  ( ~ s . In this work , we are concerned with the li ) llowing components o\[' the ALT-J/E system : 1  . The Semantic lliera . rchy , 2 . The Semantic Dictionary , and 3 . Tile Translation lules . 
We briefly describe each of these CO mln ) nents below . For more detail sal ) out the AI , T- . I/E system , we refer the reader to \[ lkehara et M . 1989, Ikehara et al 1990, ikehara et al1991\] . 
As shown in l " i gam ~1 , the Semantic ltierarchy is it SOFt of colt ( :el ) ttl ( ? SltllrtlSrepresent editsitl ; l'(?estructure in which each node is called a . SC'IIta'tttiC cat-egolw , or a (: a tego'l ~ 9R ) rsiml ) licity . Edges in this structure represent " is a " relation sam  ( rag the categories . 
For example , " Agents " and " P ( ! ople " ( see Figure 1 ) are both categories . Tile edge between these two ( : at-egories indicates that any instance of " l ) eoph ~'' is also an instance of " Agents " . The current version of ALT- . l/E's Semlmtic llierarchy is : 12 levels ( let , I ) and has about 3000 nodes . The Semantic Dictionary maps ( ~ it(:h . \]~4pall(' . sCIIO tlll to its aI ) prol ) riate SeItlalltic cRt-cgories . For example , the SelilallticD ! ctionary states that the noun ) ~!:~  ( niwatori )  , which meahs " chicken " OF " h011" ill English , is an instance of the categories " Meat " and " Birds "  . 
The Translation Rules in AUI?-J/E associate Japanese patterns with English patterns  . Currently , ALT-J/E uses roughly 10 , 000 of these rules . ' As Figure 2 shows , each translation rule has a . \] apanese fret-tern its its left hand side and all English pattern as its right hand side  . For example , the first rule in this figure basically sltys that if the  , Japanese verb in a sentence is ~ J ' ~< ( yaku) , its subj ('(: t is an instance of " l ) e ople '' , and its ol ) ject is an instance of " lh'ead " or " Cake " , then the following English pattern is to bell S ( ?d:
Sub . jeer " l ) ake " Obj(!ct.
Note that in this ( : ~ ethe Japan ( ! severb ~ y ~ (   ( yaku ) is transhtted into the English verb'q ) akc '" . This slune . \] aI ) anes ( ! yet'l ) cait also be translated into the English verbs " roast "  , " broil " , " crenmte " or " burn " , depend-lug on the context . These ( : ~ Lses axel and led by the fore " other rules given in Figure  2  . 
Translation rules are meant only to handle basic sentences that contain just a single  . \] itl ) a . ltt . ' sevr ) . 
Such sentences are called " simples elitell CeS . ''2'\[ l'o translate a comlllex sentence , M ; \]'- , I/E does various ldnds of pre - and post-proc ( ~ssing , l/oughly speaking , the given complex sentence is first broken into a collection of simple sentences in the we -processing phase  . Then , the English translations of these are combined together in the postprocessing t  ) u ~ se to give the final translation of the complex sentence  . 
To translate a simple sentence , AI : I'-J/E looks for tile most ai ) I ) roi ) ria . te translation rule to use . Based on the VO l'b of the sentence , the system considers ius candidates all those tra . nslation rules that have this verb on their lefthand side  . ' l'he English pattern of the rule , whose JaI ) imese pattern matches the s0Ii-tell ( : ( !  ) estisth ( ! iiosod to generate the desired English translation  . 
As shown in Figm'e 2 , the , Ial ) anese patterns are exln'essed using th ( , wu'iM ) lesNI , N  ~ ,  . .  . , etc . , which r ( !\]\[ ) Hs ( llt variol l SCO Ill p ( )lleIltS o f it Ja , pallese S(~Ilt(!llCe~such as the subject , the ob . iect , et(: . : lThe"degreeO\[llilttchillg ~\] ) otw ( R !

3 Shortcomings of the Manual
Approach "1) ranslation rules in the AI , T- , I/I~system have so far been composed manually 1 ) yhunmn ( ! xl ) erts . flow-ever , due to the high cost-1)er-ruh . '  , and b ( ~ ( : aus ( ~ of the hugenm nlmr of translation rules needed fl  ) rAL'I'- , \]/ I ); to carry out ; treas ( ) nabl( . ' transhttion job , the manual apI ) roachhms been conchided by the d ( ~veloI ) ers of AUI'-J/I ' ~ to be impractic ld . In particular , the l '( , lh ) w-ing l ) roblems have been wported : ? lhiilding and mmntaining the translation rules require * t grelt tdeal of expertise  . "1 " o qualify t in " this task , skill flf lexI ~ erts are required not only to master both a al  ) an ese and l ! ; liglish , In it also t ( ) b (' . flfllyfiuniliar with Al ; I '- J/l ' ; ' s large S ( ~ lnanti ( : llierarchy and to understand the overall l ) l' ( ) ( : (  . ' ss of the system . Such qualifications are costly and involve extensive training  . 
. In spite of the wmt am ( rant of resourc ( ~s spent on tmilding the current ruh ! s of AI2F- . III '; by human exports , faults are still detected from time to tinm , In al?ing the malnt ( ! ilance of th ( ; system~t (' oiltilllOliSr(~(ll\]r (! Iil(ilt .

Whenever this structure is altered , the translation rules mnstalsot ) erevised to r ( qh* ( : t the change . Such revision is extr(~mely troubh~sonu . , and error-prone if it is don (; mamlally . 
4 A Machine Learning Approach "\[' lie problems we have just listed regarding the man--ual construction of A\[f  . \['- , l/l'\]'s translation rules are largely solved if the process can be automated  . An attractive approa ( : h to this l ) robhmiisl to resort to inductive machine learning techniques to extract the desired translation rules fl'om examples of  . laI ) an esc sent ( m ( : ( ~s and their English translations . Attit ( . ' on > rent stage , how ( wet , learning translation rules fully automatically from eXaml  ) les alone seems tolm too chalhmging . A more realistic goal is to minimizer at hc'r than to tot Mlyeli Hlinat  ( ~ the intervention of human exp ( ' rts in the rifleaquisiti~m process . Thus , OIll " Cllrl ' ( ?

The goal of the pr ( ! sent work is to learn what we call " partial translation rules "  . A partial translation rule consisls ( ) l " the lefthand side along with the English verb of the righthand side of a translation rule  . hi other words , the otlly difl in ' en (: e between it transla . tionrul ( . ' and at partial translation ruhj is that the latter has only an I'\]nglish verl  ) rather than it full English patt0rn its its right hand side . 
Constructing a partial translation rule is the most ditll cult part of constructing a  . tl ' anslati(m rule . ln-d(~e(l , t ; /ll'liillgitl ) itrtial Fill ! into a comlil ( ! teone is a relatiw ~ ly easy t ; ask that can Imdone by a human operator with moderate know h!dge of English and  , Jal ) ~ Ul (!

5 Learning Task and Methods
In this work , we investigate two dift'erent inductiw , l (' arning algorithms . Before talking about these algorithms , we will first II iMc . e the learning task more precise , alid shed some light Oil the diftl culties that distinguish it from other previously studied learning tasks  . 
5.1 Tile Learning Task
The . iol ) of a learning algorithm in our setting is to construct partial translation rules  , l , ' or a given , lapan(~s(!verb , l-vcr'bandal ) ossil)le English transhl-tionl , ?- vcrbi of that verb , the MgorMlm has tollnd then pln'ol~riate condition  ( s ) that should ho M in the ( ' i ) litoxtillOl'dOrti ) Illlt1 )   , \]-' O , f ~' l'l ) to E-VC . 'tq)i . 
As an exmn lfl (! , consider the , lapanese verb/!E5 ( tsukau ) . This verb corresponds to the English verbs " use  "  , " spend " and % ml ) loy " . The cloice aniong these ID n . t ~ lish verbs del ) (mds mostly on tim o@ct of the sentence , l , ' or example , if the object is mi instance of " Asset " or " Time "  , then " spend " is it pl ) ro-priate . Thus , it rough rule for mapping ? < 5 ( tsukau ) to " Slmnd " may look like 11: "\[ . l -, t . : m ,  =  t'~5 \]' I'III'~Nl\]-\'i ~ Rn=spend . 
\ VOS(!('I'7 . to \] Oitl'll this kind of l'lll ( !s froll lexatl ~ ll ) lt ! s of , hil ) anesesenti . mces and their I : ; nglish translations , such as the following pair : After parsing ( which is carriel trot by AI , T-J/Iq's parser ) , the . above exanq ) le gives the ftllowing l ) ail ': ( \[ J-\~: , u = ~5 . ~; tuuEc'r = mtj > ,) .

Note that if we create a feat mefure very semantic category c and every sentence CO ml lonent N i  , then the total number of features will become inti  . ' asibl v large ( In any thousands ), llowe . ver , what we need is only to consider those categories that a pleared in the training data  , and their ancestors ( the set A above ) . 
In our experiments , this results in a reasom flleram > ber of features  ( one to two hundred )  . This is 1ecause the numler of examples is limited and also t ) ecause of the rather " tilted " distribution of what categories can natur Mlyat Iear as a certain  ( : Ol Ill Otlellt of it Sell-tenee for a given verb . ( Eg . the object of the verl f ; 2~3"( no mu ) , which roughly means to " drink " , cannot be just mlything ! ) The most important a ( lvml tage of the alove approach is that it cmt be applied to aln biguous training examlles as they are  , without the need to remove them n biguity explicitly as wcdid with Ilaussler's algorithm  . Another adwmtage of using ID3 is that we do not need to break our learning task into binary class learning problem since  ID3 is caI ablc of Mu'n-ing multiclass learning concepts  . 
6 Experimental Work
The goad of tile experiments reIorted here is to evaluate the q m dity of the partiad translation rules learned by the two h  . ~ m'ning methods we have just descriled . 
The comiar is on includes the folhwing three settings :  1  . Using llaussler's algorithm to learn frill training examlles ~ ff tere moving them nl  ) igulty . 
2 . Using ID 3 to h ; arn from training examl ) les after removing the ambiguity at nd performing the transformation given in the Subsection  5  . 3 . 
3 . Using ID3 to learn from tn fining exam Iles after performing the transfi  ) rmation given illtile Subsection 5 . 3, trot without removing the . ambiguity . 
In a sense , the first setting rell resents the lmst we can do in the absence of the ambiguity sincellmlss ler's al-goritlm does at good jobinexi  ) loiting the baekgTmnd knowledge fi-om the Selnanti : Ilierarchy  . Comparing Setting 2 with Setting 1 tells us how success fiflour transformatim of the training examlles is in letting  1D3 make use of the available Iackground knowledge . 
Fimdly , comparing Setting 3 with Settir , g 2 tells n show successful our transhn'mation is in letting  1133 learn directly froinamt ) igalous training examl ) les .

Thei ) ertir mane elvels of both lhmssler's alg ( )-rithm and ID3 when learning from unambiguous examples are quite similar in Sl  ) ite of the fact that each algorithm implements a different bias and has a completely dift in ' ent wayf'exlloiting the background knowledge  .

In fact , for some of the verbs , the terforl Il~tn:eisevelk\] ) etter when a ml ) iguity is present . This suggests that the aplroach we have chosen to de  . al with ambiguity is effective for our task , and tl , a text licit retllvitlo\[ambiguity is not an attractive strategy sim:e it is not easy to t  (  , and since it does not greatly improve the a ( : : m ' aey anyway . 
The most importantll ( in there is that the olserved a : cura:y of both the  . 11) 3a . lg or ith maimllaussler's algorithm is satisfactorily high over a !  . linspite of the limited mmfler of the training examlk's used  .
