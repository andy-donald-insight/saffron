The design and implementation of a large-coverage computational grammar of French is described  . This grammar is compared to a comprehensive computational grammar of English which was implemented using the same computer work bench  . Although many similarities may be observed in the two grammars  , there are important structural differences which can be traced back to features specific to the F~'ench language  , notably agreement and cliticization . 
1 Introduction
We present a large-coverage computational grammar of French  ( CGF )   1 and discuss some implementation aspects of ' this grammar by comparing it to the Alvey Natural Language Tools Grmmmar  ( ANLT Grammar )   ( Grover et al ,  1 . 993 ) which wins also implemented using the Grammar Development Environment  ( GDE )   ( Bogm'aev et al ,  1988) . The grammar of French was implemented as part of a larger project  , the goals of which are the development and application of Generalized Phrase Structure Grammar  ( GPSG )   ( Gazdar et al . , 1985 ) in general and the design and implementation of a comprehensive computational grammar for French in particular  . 
In this paper , we highlight the many similarities between the two grammars but especially differences due to phenomena particular to French  . 
This leads to a description of the major structural differences between tile two grammars  . 
We shall not justify the reasons for our choice of GPSG but will simply point out that GPSG is a formal theory which is unification-based and hence well-suited for computational linguistics  . 
The Grammar Development Environment is a computer work bench for the development and evaluation of computational grammars of natural  1This resem'ch is flmded by SSH RCC ( 40-93-0607 ) and by FCAR ( 95ERl198 ) language which are described in a style close to that of GPSG  . It embodies a modified version of GPSC which is easier to implement than its theoretical counterpart  . The GDE was developed as part of the Alvey Natural Language Tools project in the UK  . 
2 Comparison of the two grammars
The ANLT grammar was used as a model and initial source of inspiration for the design and implementation of the grammar of l ~' ench  , despite obvious differences between tile two languages  . Both grammm-strive to account for the same t ) roper-ties of natural language although they differ on points of detail  , the differences being essentially structural . 
2.1 Similarities
Xbar theory is used in ( Gazdar et al , 1985) to characterize constituent struct m'e . In our grammar , as in the ANLT grammar , Xbar schemata are respected in general , although there are differences of detail . There is no specifier in the verb phrase ( VP ) , thus the V2 immediately dominates the V ; complex specifiers in noun phrases ( NP ) and adjectival and adverbial phrases ( AdjP and AdvP ) are given special treatment : there are X2 level specifiers of X2 constituents , ast brexample in : ( I)N2-4R2\[POSS+\] , H2 the man's black hat
N2--+N2\[TYPR coll\] , H2 une foule deces 6 tudiants ( acrowd of those students ) Furthermore , some constituents have a specifier at level X1 even if there is a specifier at level X2  :  ( 2 ) N2-4 Spec , H2 to us lesenfants , all the children
N2-4 Det , H Ilesenfants , the children Adjectival , adverbial and prepositional phrases are treated in a similar fashion in both grammars  . 

Thus in ninny respects our grammar follows closely the ANLT grammar  . 
2.2 Differences
The structure of tile NP and that of the VP in the CGF differ from those in the ANLT grammar  . This is a reflection of phenomena which are characteristic of French : cliticization  , present in IS " ench but not in English , and agreement , which is more limited in English titan in l ~ ? eneh  . We overview these phenomena and then examine the structures  . 
2.2.1 Agreement
There are nn my more cases of agreement in French than in English and mmw more lexical items exhibit agreement fi ~  , atures ( determiners , adjectives , past participles and conjugated verbs ) . 
In particular , two sets of rules are required to account for AdvP and AdjP constituents in CGF  , since only the latter is subjecto agreement . The agree Inent patterns are more complex as well . In the VP for example the past participle (' . an agree with a direct object when it is anteposed  ( 3 )  , or with its subject when it is conjugated with ~ . trc ( for a nonpronominal verb ) ; otherwise it remains invariant . 
(3 ) latable que Paula faite ( the table that Paul made ) illes avus ( he saw them ) In quantified NPs , we examine two cases : 1 . When the subject of aw : rb is an NP quantified by an adverb or an adjective  , the complement of tile quantifier determines agreement :  ( 4 ) beau coup degar conson tarrivds ( n inny boys have arrived ( masc , pl . ) ) bcau coup defilles sont m ' riv des ( many girls have arrived ( ti-~m , pl . )) 2 . When tile subject of a verb is a collective noun , the verb <: an agree either with the collective or with the element it quantifies :  ( 5 ) unefoule degar consestar rivd c ( acrowd of boys has arrived ( fern , sg . ) ) unetbule degar consson tarrivds ( acrowd of boys have arrived ( masc , pl . )) 2 . 2 . 2 Clit ics Cliticization refers to the phenomenon where a w ~ r bal complement can be pronominalized and adjoined to the verb:  ( 6 ) Pierrevoltle garqon ( Peter sees the boy ) 
Pierrelevolt (" Peter him sees ")
This phenomenon is interesting because it bears a superficial resemblance to long distance dependencies  , which are dealt with by SLASH in GPSG . 
3 Structural differences
The data relative to cliticization and agreement have dictated the structure of the French VP and 

3 . 1 The s t ructure of the F rench VP The structure for the VP in English developed in the ANLT grammar corresponds to that in  ( Gazdar et al ,  1982 ) : a binary branching structure where each verbal element takes a VP complement of a specifctype  ( the " cascading structure " )  . 
The same type of structure for the French VP is generally assumed in transformational or generative grammar and also in GPSG analyses  ( Miller ,  1991) . We haw ' , departed from these traditional analyses and have implelnented a fiat structure for the compomld tenses  , while retaining the cascading one for the passive  . For example , the structure for a direct transitive verb is expressed by the rule in  ( 7 ) and the passive by the rnle in ( 8 ) :  ( 7 ) SV--~H\[AUX+\] , V\[AUX-\] , N2(8) SV-+H\[SUBCAT~tre\] , X2\[PRD\]In rule (8) , the X2 can be realized as a p~s sive participle or any predicative complement  , as in the GPSG analysis of passives . 
3 . 1 . 1 Arguments for a f lat s t ruc ture The arguments in favour of distinguishing the two structures are numerous  . Many have been discussed in ( Abeill 6 A Godard , 1994) and also in ( Emirkanian A Da Sylva ,  1995) . Directly relevant : to our discussion is the fact that only the passive participle may be cliticized  ( 9a ) 2 not the participle involved in compound tenses ( gb ) :  ( 9 ) a . i lestaired par Marie ( he is loved by Mary ) ill'est ( " heit is " ) b . ilamang ~5 une poin me ( heate an apple ) * ill ' a ( " heith as " ) Thus in the passive structure , the copula behaves like control verbs such as the modal vouloir  ( to want ) which take a V2 complement : ilveut partir ( he wants to leave ) yields illeveut ( " heit wants " )  . 
Our analysis of the French VP also provides an account of past partieilfle agreeinent  . In GPSG , agreement is handled by the Control-Agreement Principle  ( CAP )  . a However , we have been unable to account for past participle agreement in French using the CAP  ( see ( Emirkanian et al , in press )); 42 With or without its eolnplements . See ( Abeill 5A
Godard , 1994) for more details.
aln the GDE implementation f the grammar of English  ( Grover et al ,  1993) , the CAP seems satisfactorily transposed : it is implemented by a relatively snmll set of propagation rules  , which respec the generality of the CAP . 
a This article shows on the other hand how , t br the past participle , the CAP can account for agreement in predicative structures  , for example the passive . 
1 025 the latter account makes use of other devices , such as the Feature Cooccurrence Restrictions and the 
Feature Specification Defaults.
3 . 1 . 2 GDE Implementat ion of a flat VP The insertion of the auxiliary into the VP structure to produce a flat VP is done by a metarule  . 
However , implementing this flat structure in the GDE was found to be highly problematic  . In the GDE , grammars are precompiled into ordered phrase structure rules  , and the number of these rules necessary to account for the VP turned out to be extremely large  . To give an idea of the size of the resulting grammar  , consider the lexical ID rule for a verb requiring an NP and a PP complements :  ( I0 ) V2--~H\[3\] , N2 , P2\[~\]Pauldonne unlivre ~ Marie ( Paul gives a book to Mary ) The following metarules operate on this ID rule : passive S  ; direct object extraction ( SLASHN2) ; direct object cliticization ( accusative ) ; direct object cliticization ( oblique ) ; indirect object extraction ( SLASHP2\[h\]) ; indirect object cliticization ( dative ) ; indirect object cliticization ( locative ) ; direct object extraction ( SLASHN2\[de\]) ; adverb insertion ; auxiliary insertion ; supercompound aux insertion ; negative adverb(pas ) insertion ; subject clitic insertion . 
Although not all rules are compatible with each other  ( in particular , no direct object extraction rule can apply to the result of the passive rule  )  , the combinatorics are complex : in a test grammar  , we found that the number of phrase structure rules corresponding to this ID rule was of the order of  2 la , or over 8000 . This is of course unacceptable , as the CGF comprises 45 different lexical ID rules . 
Not all of them give rise to so many rules , but the compilation time and size of the output grammar made this solution impractical  . 
Instead , we implemented the structure of the VP as a verbal complex of the auxiliary and the past participle which is sister to the complements  . 
The above metarules apply either to the verbal complex or to the complements  , thus reducing considerably the combinatorics . The resulting structure is sufficiently equivalent from a theoretical perspective  ( i . e . , the past participle and its complements do not form a constituent  ) and it allowed us to implement the bulk of our grammar  . 
The size of our grammar is now as follows : 185 ID rules and 81 metarules . After compilation , these 185 ID rules expand to 2630 expanded ID rules and 3053 phrase structure rules . 
Let us now turn to our account of the structure of the NP  . 
5The optionality of the agent gives rise to two ID rules from the output of this metarule  . 
3 . 2 The s t ructure of the F rench NP The data relative to cliticization and agreement have shaped the structure of the NP in various ways  . Our study of the French NP has been influenced mainly by the work of  ( Milner ,  1978) . We will concentrate here oil quantitative structures  ( such as beau eoup d'enfants , many children ) and partitive structures ( such as beau coup decesen-rants , many of these children ) . These involve a quantifier ( adverb , pronoun , collective or adjective ) whose " complement " contains respectively a determiner less NP with de  ( defilles ) or an NP with a definite determiner ( decesfilles )  . 
The ANLT grammar's treatment of partitive NPs such as " all of the children "  , akin to tro is decos filles and also to be au eoup defilles  , assumes a three-way branching structure , given by the fbl-lowing rule: ( 11 ) N2\[+SPEC\]--~A2 , P\[ofj ,   N2\[+SPEC \] This structure must be rejected for French based on data from cliticization : the de and what follows must form a constituent  , which may be cliticized as enlike a P2 \[ PFORM de\]can be ( 12 ) jeparle de Marie ( Ispeak of Mary ) j'en parle ( " I of-her speak " ) jevo is beau coup defilles ( I seem any girls ) j ' envo is beau coup ( " I of-them seem any " ) But rather than treat this constituent as a P2 , we treat it as an N2 with \[ PFORM de\] , because of agreement data : agreement features from the complement must be allowed to percolate upwards to explain possible agreement patterns with it  , as in unefouled ' hommes on tvenus ( a crowd of men have come )  . This can be achieved only if the complement is allowed to be an  N2 head of the higher NP , and not a P2 ( there is no justification for agreement features on a PP in French  )  . ( Miller ~ ,  1991 ) also argues in favour of treating de and din French as markers on  N2  , rather than as prepositions , yielding N2\[PFORM de\] and N2\[PFORM5\] . 
The following rules for a subset of French quantitative constructions highlight the prevalence of this  N2:6   ( 13 ) a . N2\[PFORMnil\]-+Adv2\[+QTE\] , H2\[de\]beau coup defilles(many girls ) b . N2\[PFORMnil\]--*N2\[Coll\] , H2\[de \] une foule defilles ( acrowd of girls ) c . N2\[PFORMnil\]-+A2\[+QTE\] , H2\[de\]tro is filles ( three girls ) d . N2\[PFORMnil\]-~H2\[de\]desfilles ( girls )   6We have omitted the description of the internal structure of this  g2 \[ de \] . Our grammar accounts for the absence of an explicit de in certain contexts  ( i . e . ,trois filles ) as well as its presence in extraposed contexts ( fenaitrois , defllles ) and its contraction with the determiner desto produce simply de  ( defilles-r~gle de cae ophonie )  . 

The following examples featuring cliticization and dislocated structures  , where tim dere appears , also argue for the N2\[de\]:(14) a . ilvoit be . aucoup d ( ; filles ( " he sees many of gMs " ) i lenvoit l ) eaucoul )   ( " he of them sees lnany " ) i lenvo it 1 ) eaucoul )  , (le filles (" he of them sees many , of girls ") (14) b . ilvoltune foule delilles ( he sees acrow d of girls ) i lenvol tunef bulc , detilles (" he of-them sees acrow d , of girls ") (14) c . ilvolt tro is filles ( he sees three girls ) i lenvo it tro is ( " he of them sees three " ) i lenvolt tro is , defilles (" he of-them sees three , of girls " ) WcI ) osit an anah ) gou structure fbr NPs with the determiner des in rule  ( d )  , i . e . , a partitive structure where , the quantifier is not st)ecified . Indeed , cliticization in cn is possit ) te (14d ) . 
(14) d . ilvoit(h ; sfilles ( heseesgMs ) i lenvo it ( " he of-theln sees " ) i lenvo it , desfilles (" he of them sees , girls ") In all structures described above , we postulate an N2 \[ de \] which may be cliticized . In that cruse , it leaves behind a " stranded " quantifier ( except in the e ; use of rule(d ) , where that quantifier is null ) . 
4 Conclusion
Overall , the coverage of the CGF is comparable to that of the ANLT grammar  , although some , of the phenomena treated are different . I ' resently , the CGF can parse isolated sentences using a limited  , though representative , hmM-compiled lexicon . In order to analyse sentences occurring in real text  , a large coverage lexicon is required . Research in progress aims at automating the lexicon I milding pro  ( ' , ess .
