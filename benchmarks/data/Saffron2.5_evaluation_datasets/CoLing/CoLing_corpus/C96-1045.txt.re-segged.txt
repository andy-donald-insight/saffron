Abstract
We describe an approach to interpreting
LFG fstructures ( Kaplan & Bresnan,
1982 ) truth-conditionally as underspeci-fledquasi -logical forms  . F-structures are either interpreted indirectly in terms of a homomorphic embedding into Quasi 
Logical Form ( QLF ) ( Alshawi , 1992;
Alshawi & Crouch , 1992; Cooper et al . , 1994a ) representations or directly in terms of adapting QLF interpretation clauses to f-structure representations  . We provide a reverse mapping from QLFs to fstructures and establish isomorphic subsets of the QLF and LFG formalism  . A simple maI ) ping which switches off QLF contextual resolution can be shown to be truth preserving with respect to an independently given semantics  ( Dalrymple et al ,  1995) . We compare our proposal with approaches discussed in the literature  . 
1 Introduction
Ditferent languages express grammatical flmctions ( such as subject or object ) in a variety of ways , e . g . 
by position or by inflection . Functional-structures ( fstructures )   ( Kaplan & Bresnan ,  1982 ) are attribute-value matrices that provide a syntactic level of representation that is intended to abstract away from such surface variations while capturing what are considered underlying generalisations  . 
Quasi-Logical Forms ( QLFs ) ( Alshawi & Crouch , 1992; Cooper et al , 1994a ) provide the semantic level of representation employed in the Core Language Engine  ( CLE )   ( Alshawi ,  1992) . The two main characteristics of the formalism are un-derspeeification and monotonic contextual resolution  . QLFs give ( partial ) descriptions of in -* Present address : Dublin City University  , Dublin 9 , Ireland ; josef Ocom papp , dcu . ielPresent address : Speech Research Unit , DRA Malvern , StAndrews Road , Great Malvern , Worcs WR 143 PS , UK ; croueh 0 signal , dra . hmg . gb tended semantic ompositions . Contextual resolution monotonically adds to this description  , e . g . 
by placing fln'ther constraints on the meanings of certain expressions like pronouns  , or quanti-tier scope . QLFs at ; all stages of resolution are interpreted by a truth conditional semantics via a supervaluation construction over the compositions meeting the description  . F-structures are a mixture of mostly syntactic information  ( grammatical flmctions ) with some semantic , predicate-argument information encoded via the values of

Unresolved QLF gives the basic predicate-argument structure of a sentence  , mixed with some syntactic information encoded in the categories of QLF terms and forms :  1 ? Scope : support ( term ( + r , < nmn = sg , spec = every > , representative , ? Q , ? X ) , term (+ g , < num=sg , spec = a > , candidate , ? P , ? R )   ) While there is difference in approach and emphasis unresolved QLFs and fstructures bear a striking similarity and itix easy to see how to get from one to the other : pn ~:  , n($r  ~ ,  . , ? r,~>~ . * Scope : n(~, .   , ~ , ~ )  ? " ) % The core of a mapping taking us from fstructures to QLFs places the values of subcategorizable grammmatieal fnnctions into their argument positions in the governing semantic form and recurses on those arguments  . I , \]' om this rather general perspective the difference between fstructures midl'l'he motivation for including tiffs syntactic information in QLFs is that resolution of such things as anaphora  , ellipsis or quantifier scope may be constrained by syntactic factors  ( Alshawi ,  1990) . 

QLF is one of information packaging rather than mG thing else  . We tbrmalise this intuition in terms of translation functions r  . The precise fln ' m of these mappings depends on whether the  Q1  , Fs and fstructures to be , map I ) ed contain comparable lv-els of syntactic information  , and in the case , of QLF how this inforination is distributed between term and form categories and the recursive structure of the QLF  . The QLF formalisln delit mratcly leaves entirely open the amounl  ; of syntactic information that should be encoded within a QLF the decision rests on how much syntactic intbr-mation is required for successful contextual resolution  . The architecture of the LFG and QLF formalism are described at lengthelse where  ( Ks-plan & Bresnan , 1982; Alshawi & Crouch , 1992; Cooper et al , 1994a ) . l/eh ) w we detine , a language of wJ\]:s(wellformedf-struct'tm:s ) , a ( family of ) translation function ( s ) rfi:om-stru ( : tures to ( unresolved ) QLFs and an inverseflmction r ~ Domuin'e solved QLF shackt of structures  , r and r-~determine is oln orphic subsets of the QLF and LFG formalism  . We eliminate r and give a direct and underspecified interpretation i terms of adapting QLF interpretation rules to fstrueture representations  . While the initial definition of ' r is designed to maxilnally exploit  1  ; he contextual resolution of QLF , later ve , rskmsn fininfise resolution efl'ecl ; s .

2 Well-formed f-structures
We define a language of wff-s(we , ll-fornmdf structures ) . The basic vocabulary consists of five disjoint set  ; s : GFs = SUIU , OBJ , OlU2 , or e , 0 ,  . . . ( subcategorizable grmnnml ; icalflmc-tions ) , Gl " ~ , := AmS , I , MODS , AMOI ) S ,  . . .

To translate an f-structure , we call on r with the first argument set to a dummy grammatical fmc-tion  , SIGMA . The reader may check that given

The truth conditions of the resulting underspecified QLF formula are those defined by the QLF evaluation rules  ( Cooper et al , 1994a ) . The original f-structure and its component parts inherit the QLF semantics viar  . r defines a simple ho-momorphic embedding of fstructures into QLFs  . 
It comes as no surprise that we can eliminate r and provide a direct underspecified interpretation for fstructures  . 
Note that r as defined above maximise stile use of tile QLF contextual resolution component : quantifier metavariables allow for resolution to logical quantifiers difl bxentfl'om surface form  ( e . g . 
to cover generic readings of indefinites ) , as do predicate variables ( in e . g . support verb constructions ) etc . A definition of ralong these lines is useful in are usability scenario where an existing LFG grammar is augmented with the QLF contextual resolution component  . Alternative definitions of r " resolve " to surface form  , i . e . minimise QLF contextual resolution . Such definitions are usefl fl in showing basic results such as preservation of truth  . Below we outline how r can be extended in order to capture more then just the basic LFG constructs and to allow for different styles of QLF construction  .

3 . 3 Non-Subcategor i zab le Grammat ica l l%mctions The treatment of modification in both f-structure and QLF is open to some flexibility and variation  . 
Here we can only discuss some exemplary cases such as LFG analyses of N and NP pre-and postmodification  . We assume an analysis involving the restriction operator in the LFG description language  ( Wedekind & Kaplan , 1993) and selnantic form indexing ( II < . . . >@) e . g . by string position ) as introduced by ( Kaplan & Bresnan ,  1982) .

as required . Note , however , that the translation in a y overspecify the range . In the f-structure domain modifiers are collected in an unordered set while in the range we impose some arbitrary ordering  . For intensional adjectives ( compare a former famous president with a famous former president  )  , this ordering may well be incorrect . Hence ordering information should be codable in ( or recoverable from ) the representations . In LFC this is available in terms of f -precedence  . A more satisfactory translation into QLF complicates the treatment of  ( nominal ) In odification as abstracted QLF forms . Modifiers are represent e ( 1 as extra arguments in the body of the form and take the form index of dm restriction as one of their argmnents :  4 x-?S cp:form ( + r , < gf = np-restr , pred = subsidiary > , 
P^P ( x , form(+a , < gf = am , pred=new > ,
Q^Q (+ r ), ? h )), ? R)
Modifier ordering can then be transferred to resolution  , or encoded in the categories of the rest , r ( > Lion and modifiers to filrther constrain the order of application selected by resolution  . 
4 Direct interpretation
The core of tile direct interpretation clauses for wff-s involve ~ s a simple variation of the quantifier rule and the t  ) redieation rule of the QLF sentan-lies ( Cooper et el . , 1994a ) . Consider tile flag-meat without N and NP modification  . As before , t ; he semant ; ics is detined in terms of a supervalu-at on construction on sets of disambiguated representations  . Models , variable assignment flmc-lions , generalized quantifier interpretations and the QLF definitions for the connectives  , abstraction and application etc . ( see Appendix ) carry over unchanged . The Ile . W quantification rule D14 non-det ; erlninistically retrieves nonrecursive Sll ) ~ categorizable grammatical fiulctions and entploys the vahle of a SI'EC feature in a generalized quaIbtiller interpretation :  D14: if %~# ( ~ ) C ' , , , if-s ,   , sub (% ~/ , (~)) ? if "~/ ; ~"?\] , : Dl \] 0 then \]2 o(qo , v ) if Vq(Q(Ax . I\[(x ), X :,: . qo\[?(~)+-x\]),v ), xnew ? if #; ~_\[;", ? . 1,:1) . . . II0\](i . e . SPF , c ~ dom (' , /;)) dmnV , (% v ) if V , ,(~o \[~/ , ( ~\]) < Ill) , v ) The new predication rule 1 ) 1 0 is defined in terms of a notion of nuclear scope f-structure : ' ~'  4See   ( Cooper et al , 1994b ) for examples of this style of treating VP modification  . 
r ) A nuclear scope f-structure ~ Cnf-sisis an f -structure resulting from exhaustive at  ) plicatiou of D14 . It can be defined inducd wdy as follows : ? if 3 i ` a variable or a constant symbol then I F1   3'1 ~ I'RI' ; I ) II(?Pl ,   .   .   .   , ? Pn ) tK@skK then12 ~( ~ , v ) if Vg(II(v ~ ,   . ,3 , ~) , v ) To give an example , under the direct interpretation the f-structure associated with most representative supported two candidates is interpreted as an underspecified semantic representation i terms of the supervaluation over the two generalized quantifie representations most  ( repr , Ax . two ( cand, . ~ y . support(x , y ))) two ( c and , Ay . most(repr,Ax . support(x , y ))) as required . The direct underspecified interpretation schema extends to the modification cases discussed above in the obvious fashion  . 
5 Howt of-structure a QLF
The reverse mapping from QLFs to LFG fstructures ignores information conveyed by resolved recta -variables in QLF  ( e . g . quantifier scope , pronouns antecedents ) , just as the mapping froInf-structure to QLF did not attempt of ill invalues for these recta -variables  . For QLF terms with simple restrictions ( i . e . no modifiers ) , 7--1 is defined as follows : ?7--l(term(I , < gf = F , ( ~ l = vi ,   .   .   .   , ( ~ n : V n > , lI ,  _ , _)):=\[O~1VlrPaEDII\[\]
LO~nVn?T-l(_:form(I , < gf = F , pred=l\[(Fi ,   .   .   . Fm ), c~l = vi , .   .   . , (~ j = Vj >, P^P ( Loi, .   .   . tim ) , _)):=\['~1Vl(~vj P/PriEDII(tF1 ,   .   .   . , tFM)\[\]r_~(ol )
LT-1
As an example the reader may verify that r-~ retranslates the QLF associated with Most representatives persuaded a candidate to support every subsidiary back into the f-structure associated with the sentence as required  . Again ,   7   --1 can be extended to the non-subcategorizable grammatical functions discussed above  . The extension is straightforward but messy to state in full generality and for reasons of space not given here  .

s If the results of linear logic deductions are interpreted in terms of the supervaluation construction we have preservation of truth directly with respect ounderspecified representations  , QLFs and sets of linear logic premisses .
