Abstract
This paper describes a statistical approach to tile interpretation of metonymy  . A metonymy is received as an input , then its possible inter-pretations are ranked by al  ) t ) lying ~ statistical measure . The method has been tested experimentally . It ; correctly interpreted 53 out of 75 metonymies in Jat ) anese . 
1 Introduction
Metonymy is a figure of st ) eech in which tile name of one thing is substituted for that of something to which it is related  . The czplicit tc . ~ mis ' the name of one thing ' and the implicit t ; c ~" mis ' the name of something to which it ; is related ' . A typical examt ) leofm ( ; tonymy is
Heread Shal(esl)e are .   ( 1 ) ' Slmkesl ) (~are ' is substitut ( ~ dfor'the works of Shakespeare ' . ' Shakest ) eare ' is the explicit term and ' works ' is the implicit term  . 
Metonymy is pervasive in natural language.
The correc~treatment of lnetonylny is vital tbr natural language l  ) rocessing a pi ) lications , es-1 ) ecially for machine translation ( Kamei and Wakao , 19!)2; Fass ,  1997) . A metonymy may be a ecel ) table in a source language but unaccet ) t-able in a target language . For example , a direct translation of ' here ad Mao ' , which is acceptable in English an (1 Japanese , is comt ) letely unac-ceptal ) leinChinese ( Kamei and Wakao ,  1992) . 
In such cases , the machine trml slation system has to interl ) retmetonynfies to generate acceptable translations  . 
Previous approaches to processing lnetonymy have used hand-constructed ontologies or semantic networks  (  . \]? as s , 1988; Iverson and Hehn-reich , 1992; B(maud et al , 1996; Fass ,  1997) . 11 As form et al ) herl ) rocessing , I'errari (1996) used t ; ex-Suchal ) t ) roaches are restricted by the knowledge bases they use  , and may only be applicable to domain-specific tasks because the construction of large knowledge bases could be very difficult  . 
The method outlined in this I ) apcr , on the other hand , uses cortms statistics to interpret metonymy , so that ~ variety of metonynfies can be handled without using hand-constructed knowledge bases  . The method is quite t ) romis-ing as shown by the exl ) erimental results given in section 5 . 
2 Recognition and Interpretation
Two main steps , recognition and i'ntc . ' q~vc-ration , are involved in the processing of metonyn ~ y ( Fass ,  1 . !)97) . in tile recognitions t ; el ) , metonylnic exl ) ressions are labeled . 1111 the in-tel'l)r (: tationst ; el) , the meanings of those ext ) res-sions meint , eri ) reted . 
Sentence (1) , for examl)le , is first recognized as a metonymy an ( t ~ Shakespeare ' is identified as the explicit term  . ' t ' he interpretation ' works'is selected as an implicit term and ' Shakespeare ' is replaced  1  ) y ' the works of Shakespeare ' . 
A conq ) rehensive survey by Fass ( \]997 ) shows that the most COlllll Oll metho ( 1 of recognizing metonymies i by selection -restriction violations  . Whether or not statistical approaches can recognize metonymy as well as the selection -restriction violation method is an interesting question  . Our concern here , however , is the interpretation of metonymy , so we leave that question for a future work . 
In interpretation , an implicit term ( or terms ) that is ( are ) related to the explicit term is ( are ) selected . The method described in this paper uses corpuss t ~ tistics for interpretation  . 
tual clues obtained through corl ) usmmlysis tor detecting metal ) lmrs . 

This method , as applied to Japanese metonymies , receives a metonymy in a phrase of the tbnn ' Noun A Case-Marker R Predicate V ' and returns a list of nouns ranked in order of the system's estimate of their suitability as interpretations of the metonylny  , aSSulning that noun A is the explicit tenn . For example , given For ' awo ( accusative-case ) kau ( buy )   ( buy a Ford )  , Vay . sya(ear ), V . s t . sdl,r'uma(vehicle ), etc . are returned , in that order . 
Tile method f bllow stile procedure outlined below to interpretaine tonymy  . 
1. Given a metonymy in the form ' Noun A
Case-Marker R Predicate V ' , nouns that can 1 ) e syntactically related to the explicit term A are extracted from a corpus  . 
2 . The extracted nouns are rmlked according to their appropriateness a interpretations of the metonymy by applying a statistical measure  . 
The first step is discussed in section 3 and the second in section 4  . 
3 In fo rmat ion Source \? e use a large corpus to extract nouns which can be syntactically related to the exl  ) licit term of a metonylny . A large corpus is vahmble as a source of such nouns  ( Church and Hanks ,  1990;
Brown et al , 1992).
We used Japanese noun phrases of the for nl AnoB to extract nouns that were syntactically related to A  . Nouns in such a syntactic relation are usually close semantic relatives of each other  ( Murata et al ,  1999) , and occur relatively infrequently . We thus also used an Anear B relation , i . e . identifying tile other nouns within the target sentence  , to extract nouns that may be more loosely related to A  , trotoc cur more frequently . These two types of syntactic relation are treated differently by the statistical nleasure which we will discuss in section  4  . 
The Japanese noun phrase Ano Broughly corresponds to the English noun phrase B of A  , lint it has an mch broade range of usage ( Kurohashi and Sakai ,  1999) . In fact , dnoB can express most of the possible types of semmltic relation between two nouns including metonymic  2~Ford ' is spelled qtS do ' ill Japanese . We have used English when we spell Japanese loanwords from English for the sake of readability  . 
concept such as that the name of a container can represent its contents and the name of an artist can imply an art ~ brnl  ( container for contents and artist for art fo rm below  )  . a Examples of these and similar types of metonymic concepts  ( Lakoff and Johnson , 1980; Fass , 1997) are given below . 
Container for contents ? glass nomizu ( water ) ? na V ( pot )   , y6i ( food )
Artist for art form ? Beethovenokyoku ( music ) ? Picas . so no e(painting )
Object for user ? ham . sandwich nokyaku ( customer ) ? saxno . sO . sya(t ) er former )
Whole tbrpart ? kuruma ( car ) notir c ? door " no knobThese exalnt ) le suggest hat we can extract semantically related nouns by using tile A no B relation  . 
4 Statistical Measure
Anletonymy ' Noun A Case-Marker R , Predicate V ' can be regarded as a contraction of ' Noun A Syntactic-Relation  ( 2 Noun BCase-Marker R Predicate V ' , where A has relation Q to B ( Yamamoto et al ,  1998) . For example , Shakc . spcare wo yomu ( read )   ( readShakespeare ) is regarded as a contraction of Shakespeare no . sakuhin ( works ) ' woyomu ( read the works of Shakespeare )  , where A = Shake . spcare,
Q = no , B = . sakuhin , R = wo , and V = yomu.
Given a metonymy in the fbrl nAR 17 , the appropriateness of noun Basan interpretation of the metonymy under the syntactic relation Q is defined by LQ  ( BIA , /~ , V ) - Pr(BIA ,  (2 ,  1~ , V ) ,   ( 2 ) ay a mamoto et al ( \]998 ) also used Ano/3 relation to interpret metonymy . 
886 where Pr ( .  -  .   ) represents l ) robal/ility and Q is either an Ano B relation or an Anear  \]3 relation . Next ; , the appropriateness of noun \]3 is defined by M ( BIA , I e , V )- n laxL c ~( BIA , l  ~ , V ) .  (3)

We rank nouns 1) yat ) plying the measure 214.
Equation (2) can be decomposed as follows:
LQ(!31A,R,,V ) = Pr(BIA,Q,R,,V)
Pr(A,Q,B,R,,V )
Pr(A,Q,R,v)
Pr(A,Q , 13) lh'(R,VIA,Q,Ix)
Pr(A,Q)Pr(R,VIA,Q)
Pr(BIA , Q ) Pr(R , VIB)-~er(R , v ) ' (4) where ( A , O ) and \] ~ , , V  are assumed to l ) e in-del ) endent of each other . 
Let f ( event ) 1 ) e the frequen ( : y of ancve'nt and Class c . s ( \] ) ) be the set of semantic ( : lasses to which B belongs . ' l'he expressions in Equation ( 4 ) are then detined t ) y4I'r ( ~ lA , Q ) - . t'(A , Q , ~ x)_f(A , Q , ~) f(A , Q ) ~1 ~ f(A , Q ,  13)' (5)

We h~wc adopted this det-inition for the sake of simplicity  . This simplification has little effect on the tilml results because ~--  ; c'cc ~ . . . . . . . . ( m Pr(l~lC)f(C , I ~' , V ) << I will usually hohl . More Sol)histieated methods ( M ; mningml(tSchiitze ,  1999 ) of smoothing f ) robability distribution m ~ yI ) eI ) eneticial . i to wever , al ) l ) lying such methods and comparing their effects on the interpretation of metonymy is beyond the scope of this l  ) aper . 
This treatment does not alter the order of the nouns ranked by the syst  ; em because l ? r(H . , V ) is a constant for a given metonymy of the form
ARV .
Equations ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) difl'er in their treatment of zero frequency nouns  . In Equation (5) , a noun B such that f(A , Q , B ) = 0 will l ) e ignored ( assigned a zero probal ) ility ) because it is unlikely that such a noml will have a close relation-shii/with noun A  . In Equation (6) , on the other hand , a noun B such that f(B , R , V ) = 0 is assigned a nonzero probability . These treatments reflect the asymmetrical proper ~yo finetonymy  , i . e . illanletonylny of the form A 1   1~ an implicit term 13 will have a much tighter relationship with the explicit term A than with the predicate V  . Consequently , anouil \] 3 such that f(A , Q , B ) >> 0Af(B , JR , V )  =  0 may be ap-propri~te as an interpretation of the metonymy  . 
Therefore , a nonzerot ) robat ) ility should be as-sign ( ; d to Pr(l  ~ . , VI1X)ev ~, nit'I(B , 2e,V);() . ~ Equation ( 7 ) is the probability that noun J3 occurs as a member of ( : : lass C . This is reduced to fU~) if 13 is not ambiguous , i . e . IC/a , ~, sc . , s,(/3)\[=f(c)1 . If it is ambiguous , then f ( B ) is distributed equally to all classes in Classes ( B )  . 
The frequency of class C isol ) tained similarly : . f(B ) (8) . f(c ) = ~ ICl(-~c . .~(13)1' 11C- . (7 where 13 is a noun which belongs to the class C . 
Finally we derive f(13, ~, v)
B q C (.0)
In summary , we use the measure M as defined in Equation (3) , and cah : ulated by applying Equation ( 4 ) to Equation ( 9 )  , to rank nouns according to their a pl ) ropriateness as possible interpretations of a metonymy  . 
Example Given the statistics below , bottle weaker u ( open )   ( open a bottle ) will be interpreted 5The use of Equation ( 6 ) takes into account a noun/3 such that J ' ( l : ~ , l , V ) = 0 . But , Stlch&llOtlll is usually ignored if there is another noun B ' such that f  ( 13' , H . , V ) > 0 be ~, ~ , , se . Eo ' ~ ct . . . . . . . U ~) P , USIO)J'(C,~e . , V ) << a<J'(lY,H,,V ) will usually hokl . This means thai the cooccurrence 1 ) rol ) al ) iliW between implicit terms and verbs are also important in eliminating in a pl  ) rol ) riate nomls . 
887 as described in the f bllowing t ) aragraphs , assuming that cap and rcizSko ( refl'igerator ) are the candidate implicit terms . 
Statistics : f(bottlc , no , cap ) = 1 , f(bott lc , no , reizgko ) = O , f(bott lc , no ) = 2 , f(bott lc , ncar , cap ) = 1 , f(bottle , near , rciz6ko ) = 2 , f(bott lc , ncar ) = 503 , f(cap ) = 478 , f(rcizSko ) = 1521 , f(cap , wo , akcru ) = 8 , and f(rciz6ko , wo , akcru ) = 23 . 
f(bott lc , no , rciz6ko )  =  0 indicates that bottle and rcizSko are not close semantic relatives of each other  . This shows the effectiveness of using AnoB relation to filter outloosely related words  .

M(cp ) = M(cplottz , and soo51.
Since M > M we conclude that cap is a more appropriate imt  ) licit term than rcizSho . This conclusion agrees with our intuition . 
5 Experiment 5.1 Material
Metonymies Seventy-fivelnetonymies were used in a next  ) erilnent to test tile prol ) osed l nethod . Sixty-two of them were collected from literature oll cognitive linguistics  ( Yamanashi , 1988; Yamam~shi , 1995) and psycholinguistics ( Kusumi , 1995) in Japanese , paying attention so that the types of metonymy were sufficiently diverse  . The remaining 13 metonymies were direct translations of the English metonymies listed in  ( Kalnei and Wakao ,  1992) . These 13 metonylnies are shown in Table 2 , along with the results of the experiment . 
Corpus A corpus which consists of seven years of issues of the Mainichi Newspaper  ( Dora 1991 to 1997 ) was used in the experiment . The sentences in tlle cortms we remor t ) hologically analyzed by Cha Senversion 2 . 0 b6 ( Matsumoto et al , 1999) . The corpus consists of about 153 million words . 
Semantic Class A Japanese thesaurus , Bunrui Goi-tty 6 ( The N ~ tional Language Research Institute ,  1996) , was used in the experiment . It has a six-layered hierarchy of abstractions and contains more than  55  , 000 nouns . A class was defined as a set of nouns which are classified in the same abstractions in the top three layers  . 
The total nmn ber of classes thus obtained was 43 . If a noun was not listed in the thesaurus , it was regarded as being in a class of its own .

However , it is not concerned with the semantic relation between an explicit  ; term and implicit term , because such semantic relations are not directly expressed ill corpora  , i . e . noun phrases of the form A no B can be found in corpora bul  ; their senmntic relations are not . If we need such semantic relations , we must semantically analyze the noun phrases ( Kurohashi and Sakai ,  1999) . 
Applicability to other languages Japanese noun phrases of the form A no B are specitie to Japanese  . The proposed method , however , could easily be extended to other languages . For exmnple , in English , noun phrases B of d could be used to extract semantically related nouns  . 
Nouns related by is a relations or part-of relations could also be extracted from corpora  ( Hearst , 1992; Berland and Charniak ,  1999) . If such semantically related nouns are extracted  , then they can be ranked according to the measure M defined in Equation  ( 3 )  . 
Lexically based approaches Generative Lexicon theory  ( Pustejovsky ,  1995 ) proposed the qualia structure which encodes emantic relations among words explicitly  . It is usefl fl to infer an implicit term of the explicit term in a metonymy  . The proposed approach , on the other hand , uses corpora to infer implicit terms and thus sidesteps the construction of qualia structure  .   8   7 Conclusion This paper discussed a statistical approach to the interpretation of metonymy  . The method t bllows the procedure described below to interpret a metonymy in Japanese :  1  . Given a metonymy of the tbrm ' Noun ASB riscoet al  .   ( 1990 ) discusses the use o1" machine-readable dictionaries and corpora for acquMng lexical semantic information  . 

Case-Marker 1 Predicate V ' , nouns that are syntactically related to the explicitter lllA are extracted fronta corpus  . 
' . 2 . The extracted nouns are ranked according to their degree of appropriateness as interpretations of the metonymy by applying a statistical measure  . 
The method has been tested experimentally.
Fifty-three out of seventy-five metonymies were correctly interpreted  . This is quite a prolnis-ing first ; step to wm'd the statistical processing of metonymy  .
