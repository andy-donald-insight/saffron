Model theoretic semantics ( MTS ) has a special attitude to describe semantics , to characterize both artificial and natural languages by pure mathematical tools and some of the basic properties of this attitude are disscussed  . 
The arsenal of MTS equipped here with such tools allowing the investigation at such a level of complexity that approximates the real situations  . These tools are developed within the frame of category theory  . 
i . The challan ~ e of formal h and l in @ of semantics
For long times , natural language has been regarded as some very soft  , a morphous , and whimsical phenomenon . 
Although theoretical considerations showed that this may not be so  , the very fact that actual linguistic methodology was quite soft and intuitive seemed to confirm the conviction that language cannot be treated very rigorously  . It is clear , however , that the more explicit and transparent framework we use for handling a very complex phenomenon  , the more can learn about what its complexity really consists of  . It has been the use of more or less mathematical- -minded methods improving the situation in recent decades  . 
A very important first step in the direction of establishing such a framework has been generative grammar  . USing the theory of formal languages it gave a fairly abstract picture of what syntaxs  , and it has also proved to be an extremely powerful tool in analysing admittedly very subtle syntactic phenomena and  , what is even more , in discovering formerly unnoticed interconnections  . 
Whatever revealing the results of generative grammar should be with respect to syntax  , however , it cannot be regarded as paradigmatic if one is interested in a semantics-oriented model of language  . Generative grammarians never put the question of what semantics is and what role it plays in language at the same theoretical level they reached with syntax  . 
It is reasonable to require that any treatment of semantics bead equate to rigorously formalized methods used for syntax  . For this we should use formalism not as abbreviation but as basic tool of investigation  , e . g . relating exact mathematical objects to components of language  . Moreover we aim to characterize language through analysing the corresponding mathematical methods  . An appropriate approach can be borrowed from mathematical logic  . 
This results the socalled model theore ~ c semantics  ( MTS )  . MTS is an attitude to investigate natural language from the point of view of semantics  . This attitude provides the investigation of natural language on an abstract level  . 
Namely , it answers the question in the most abstract sense what language is and what its basic components are  . The basic properties of the MTS's attitude are analysed in  \[31  . 
2. What is MTS ?
Language can be analysed only through analysing language carriers  . 
From the different possible functions , the language possesses , we find the cognitive one the most significant and this answers our question above  . Considering a language carrying system/whether it be human or a machine or else/the cognitive function is realized while the language is used to describe objects and events of the environment under cognition  . Characterising language we abstract from the cognitive process itself and from the internal concern is the outcome of the cognitive process  , that is , descriptive texts and their relation to the environment which they refer to  . MTS attitude demands an ideal external observer  ( EO ) who is to model the system ( S ) and the system's environment world ( W )  . EO forms models of S , of W and of the SW relation . 
In order that EO should be able to form the intended models  , he must possess the following kinds of knowledge about the sample situation  ( and EO being an ideal observer , we assume here ally does ) :  ( i ) EO knows the aspect and the level at which Smay perceive and describe the environment  ; in other words , EO knows S's sensitivity . 
( ii ) EO knows those fundamental aspects of W that S may describe  . 
(i ) - ( ii ) together ensure that EO models Wad equately wi th respect to S  . 
( iii ) EO knows that S is finite whereas W is both inf inite and infinitely complex  . 
( iv ) EO knows that S's actual en-vironment is accidental  . The knowledge Smay obtain at each stage of its cognition is compatible with infinitely many possible worlds  . The SW re-lation is therefore uncertain : the texts of S always correspond to infinitely many environments  , rather than a unique one . 
On the basis of ( i ) - ( iv ) EO forms the following models : The model of S will just be a system producting texts  ( more precisely , the material bodies of texts , whatever they should be ) . In case EO happens to be a mathematician , Model ( S ) will be a formal grammar capable of gen-er at ing the texts of the language  . 
The model of W is a metalinguistic descript ion of the world  , adequate to S's sensitivity . For purely theoretical purposes , EO only has to take into account that S has some fixed though arbitrary sensitivity  , determining the possible character of the objects and phenomena of WS may describe  . When modelling some concrete language , S's sensitivity is also fixed though no longer arbitraryly  . In case EO happens to be a mathematician , Model ( W ) will be a mathematical object . Because of the uncertainty of the SW relation , Model ( W ) is a class of models of infinitely many poss ible worlds  . 
The model of the SW relation is some cor respondance between elements of texts and things in the world-models  . In case
EO happens to be a mathematician,
Model ( S-W ) can be a class of relations or functions . 
We have reached the point where we may define language as it appears at this level of abstract ion  . By an abstraot language L a we mean a triple < Model  ( S )  , Model ( W  ~ , Model(SW ) > . Furthermore , we call Model ( S ) the syntax of LA , and Model ( W ) and Model ( SW ) together the semantics of LA . We emphasize that all these models are formed by an ideal external observer and are described in his own language  .

The set Ft of all possible formulas generated from the alphabet with logical connectives in the usual way corresponds to Model  ( S )   . The class M~of all possible t-type relat ions ? ructures  ( models ) corresponds to Model ( W )  . The socalled validity rela-tion h % tx to
Model Thu~at-type classical first order language Lt is the triple < F t  , Mt , l=> . 
3. MTS in more complex situations
A very simple , we may say , an ide-alized situation has been considered above  . Namely with respect to Sit was supposed that its cognition goes on at a fixed level and aspect of analysis  , i . e . with a fixed sensitivity . We call this type of cognition homogeneous cognition  . 

However MTS attitude enables us to characterize natural language not only in the above simplic ity but in the complexity that approximates more realistic cases  . 
Indeed a system S c and es ri be the same objects and events of W from different aspects and at different levels cf detailing  . Moreover beyond the great spectrum of sens it ivity different environment worlds can be the object of cognition  . Cognition in this situation is said to be heterogeneous cognition  . 
The situation to be described from the point of view of EO is as follows  . 
Systems sensitivity ~ 1 \[sensitivity iI The natural language itsel f virtually seems to enable us to speak about very different kinds of environment at very different levels from very differ-ent aspects  . 
Thus in this light natural language appears as an extremely rich many -- purpose language  . 
Beyond the surface natural language consits of such parts which themselves are languages as wel l  ( cf . with the subdevision of natural language into a set of dialects or sociolects  )   . 
These parts , the sublanguages , are historically formed from others . With the growth of the observable environment the corresponding knowledge also widens  . 
The latter needs new language elements so as to be described  . Therefore some words change their meanings , new concepts appear which emerge into new sublanguages  . 
E . g . the word " tree " has quite a different meaning for a woodman  , for a biologist , for a painter , for a child , for a linguist , for a mathematician , etc . The different meanings are con~nected with d ifferent sublanguages which are but dif ferent sociolects in this case  . 
However the sublanguages are not independent . They are in a very complex connection , e . g . one may extract lexical morphological or other kinds of connec-tions on the base of which one or other hierarchy of sublanguages can be sorted out  . Such a hierarchy provides a possible " select ion " for the natural language  . Thus a hierarchy of languages consists of the constituent languages together with the relat ion considered between them  . 
Note that one can find a detailed survey of di fferent approaches to sublanguages in  \[6\]  , where another approach has arisento analyse sublanguages which are called there subsystems of languages  . 
How natural language as a many purpose one can be investigated with 
MTS attitude.
First of all a socalled disjunctive approach can be applied for  , according to which EO subdivides the language into such parts each of which can be modelled as a homogeneous one  , i . e . as a language that corresponds to a unique and f ixed sensitivity  . 
Now it is supposed that Shas several languages rather than a single one  . So Model ( S should consist of a conglomerate of sublanguages  . However if the sublanguages were independent then EO could model S as a conglomerate of subsystems  . But this is not the case because among most of the sublanguages there are some transition possibilities e  . g . translation , interpretation . 
The MTS attitude possesses tools ( developed within the frame of mathe-matical logic  ) by the use of which the homogeneous cases can be described  . So a conglome rate of languages can also be descr ibed by these tools but only as a conglomerate of independent languages  . 
What about the connection between two languages ? Mathematical logic provides tools only for the case when the languages have the sames ignature  , i . e . 
when their alphabet is the same . In this case the notion of homomorphism is powerful enough to describe the connec-tion between the languages  . But such a case is of not much interest to linguists  . 
Perhaps it is more interesting to analyse the connection between languages of different type  ( e . g . between at l--type and t~-type first order c lassical languages l  . 
Let us see e.g . translation.
Having two different languages say,
English and Russlan , translating a text from one into the other f irst of all we require not a direct cor respondence between the corresponding " world concep-tions " of the languages and only then is it resonable to establish the connection between the syntactical elements  . In MTS this means that for the translation we have to i  ) represent the " world conception " of the languages in question  . A " world conception " is but a set of sentences  ( knowledge ) that determines a subclass of Model ( W )  ; ii ) establish the connection between the cor responding sub-classes of models  , i . e . between the " world conceptions " ; iii ) establish the connection among the cor responding syntactical elements  . 
But up to now MTS has not been in possession of tools to satisfy the above requirements  ( i ) - ( iii )   . 
Note that in mathematical logic a set of sentences determines a theory  . A theory T determines a subclass Mod ( T ) of models , namely those models where each sentence of T is valid  . ( Thus a theory T induces a new language < F t , Mod(T ) , I => . ) Thus f i rst of all a connect ion between the cor respond ing theor ies is requ i red for the translation  . 
However translation between any two languages may not always exist  . E . g . let us have two languages physics and biol- ogy and we want to establish connection between them  . For this we should analyse the connection between the corresponding knowledges  . However this analysis , as usual , cannot be established directly . 
A mediator theory is needed . The media-tor is an interdisciplinary theory  , e . g . 
the language of general system theory ( see e . g .  \[2\]) . By the use of the media-to ranew language with a new kind of knowledgearizes from the input languages  , namely biophysics . 
Our aim is the extension of the MTS attitude to analyse the semantics of many-purpose languages and language hierarchies  . We develop such tools ( wlth-in the frame of mathematical logic ) by the use of which EO can model a language carry ing system not only in a homogeneous situat ion  , but in a heterogeneous one too , the complexity of which approximates the real cases  . 
Here we only outline the basic idea providing the basic notions  , since the bounds of this paper do not allow us to give a detailed description of the tools 
This can be found in \[ i \].
Although the first order classical languages do not seem to be adequate for linguistics  , it still provides basis for any MTS research . Therefore we introduce the necessary tools of the analysis of the hierarchies of classical f irst order languages  . These tools can be extended for the analysis of different kinds of languages making use of the experience provided by the analysis of the classi-cal case  . 
4. Basic notions
Definition I . ( similarity type)
A similarity type t is a pair t = < H , t '> such that " t ' is a function , t':Domt ' ~ N where N is the set of natural numbers and O~N  , and H~_Dom(t') . 
Let < r,n > Et'(i . e . let t'(r ) = n ) . If r6H then r is said to be an n1 -ary function symbol , if r ~ H then r is said to be an nary relation symbol  . ?
Let ~ be an ordinal . F ~ denotes the set of all t-type formulas contain-ing variable symbols from a set of vari-ables of cardinality a  . Thus at-type first order language is < F ?, M . , t => . If Ax-F . and 9CF then ~ xI:~means .  ~  . 
that 9 is a semantical consequence of

Definition 2. ( theory )
A pair T = < Ax , F . ~> , where Ax~F ais--t said to be a theory in a variables  .  ?
Note that a theory provides a sublanguage of L , namely the triple

Let T = < Ax , F ~> be a theory , and ~~~ ~ xFabe ~ the semantical equi~nc . tT t defined as follows . For any formulas ~, % EF t : ~~ T % iff
Axf = ~~-~~.
Definition 3. ( concept )
The ~ set of the concepts of a theory T is Cm~F ~ /~  .   ( F ~/ ~ T means the factor i-z ~ tion-of ? he ~ et of formulas into such classes any two e lements of which are semantically equivalent w  . r . t . T .  ) ?
Thus in the case of a given theory
TC_contains all the formulas which are compatib le with T  . Moreover C determines what can be described a T all about the models by the use of theory T  . Note that to CT a Boole algebra can be corresponded where O and  1 correspond to " false " and " true " respective ly and the operators correspond to the logical connectives  . Let us consider the following Let t = < ~ , < R , i >> be the simularity type and T = < 0 , F\[> beat heory . ( Note that this theory is axiomless . ) We write x instead of X o , R x instead of R(x ) and ~ instead of 9/~ . The concept algebra CT looks as fol Iows ~~ x Rx 
V x R c = H x R x A H x ~ R x , d = V x R x V V x ~ R x , e = Rx-VxRx , f = ~ Rx~VxnRx , g = RxAHx ~ Rx , h = nRxA~xRx , i = 9xRx ~( RxAHx ~ Rx ) , j =\] x ~ Rx-(~RxAgxRx ) . 
The vertexes marker by ~ are the fix-points of the operation ~ Xo  . 
The formulas of the above C = tell all
T that can be said about the t-type models in the classical first order language of as ig nature of a single unary relation symbol when the theory is a tomless  .  ?
Now we define how a theory can be interpreted by another one  . 
Definition 4. ( interpretation )
Let T = < Ax ~ , F ~> and T0=<Axa , Fk > be theories in ~ variables . Let = m : F . e ~ F ~ . 
The=\[ri~e<T ~ , m , T ~> is said to be an interpretation going from T ~ into Ta  ( or an interpretation of T ~ in T ~ ) iff the following conditions hold : a/m ( x . = x . ) = ( x . = x . ) for ever y i , j < a ; b/m (~) - ~ m (~) ~ m ( ~) , m (~) = ~ m (~) , m(\]x . 9)=gx . m(~) for all 9 , % ~ F  ~ , i < a ; c/A x e ~( ~) far all ~6 F ~ such t ~ t

We shall often say that m is an interpretation but in these cases we actually mean < T ~  , m , T2> .  ?
Let m , n be two interpretations of
TI in Ta.
The interpretations < TI , m , T2> , < T1 , n , Ta > are defined to be semantically equivalent , in symbol sm~n , iff the following condition holds :
I =\[ m (~)*-~ n(~)\] for all ~ F ~ Axa
Let < TI , m , T ~> be an interpretation.
We define the equivalence class m ~ of m ( or mo ~ e precisely < TI , m , T2>/~) to be : m/~=<TI , n , T2>: nmm . 
Now we are ready to define the connection between two theories TI and  T2  . 
Definition 5. ( theory morphism )
By a theory morphism u:T1-T2 going from T ~ into T2 we understand an equivalence class of in ter pretations of TI in Ta  , i . e . 
is a theory morphism ~: TI~T2 iff v == m/~for some interpretation < TI , m , T2> . ? The following definition provides a tool to represent theory morphisms 
Definition 6 .   ( presentation of theory morphisms ) a > be Let T = < AxI , F9> and Tp = < Axa , Ftatwo theories in ~ la varia Sles . 
( i ) By a presentation of interpretations from TI to  T2 we understand a mapping p : t ~ - ~ F ~ . 
( ii ) The interpretation < TI , m , T 2> satisfies the presentation p : t ~ - ~ F~2 ' iff for every < r , n > Et ~ the followlng conditions hold : a/If rEHI then m  ( r ( xo . . . . . Xn_2) == Xn-1 ) = p(r , n ); b/Ifr ? H1 then m(r(xo . . . . . xn_l )) == p(r,n ) . 
We define the theory morphisms v to satisfy the presentation p if < TI  , m , T2> satisfies p for some < TI , m , T2>6~ .  ?
Proposition I.
Let TI=<AxI,F9> and T2=<Axa,F9>be,1t .   . ~ ~ ~ ~2 two theorles . ~ etp : tlF ~ be a pres-entation of in ter pretatio ~ from TI to 
Ta . Then there is at most one theory morphism which satisfies p  .  ?
Category theory provides the adequate mathematica l frame within which theories and theory morphisms can be considered  . From now on we use the basic notions of category theory in the usual sense  ( see e . g . \[4\] or\[5\]) . 
First of all we show how the category interest ing for us looks like  . 
( i ) ( ii )
Definition 7.
THa_i is defined to be the pair
THa~d<ObTHa , MorTHa > of classes.
0bT~=<Ax , F ~> : t is an arbitrary similagity type and Ax ~ F ~  , 
MorTHa ~ < TI , v , T2>:V is a theory morphism ~: TIT 2 , TI~E0 bT ~ . 
Let v:TI~T2 and w:Ta--Ts be two theory morphisms . We define the composition wov:T1~Ts to be the unique theory morphism for which there existsmE ~ and new such that  w0u=  ( n0m ) /~  , where the function ( n0m ) - Fa~Fa is defined ? tIta ( iii ) Let T = < Ax , F ~> be a theory . The identity function Idea is defined ~ t to beIdF ~< ~  , ~>:~6F~\] . 
The identity morphism Id ~ on T is defined to be IdT ~  ( IdF ~ ) /~ ?
Proposition 2.
THa is a category with objects Ob/Ha , morphisms MorTHa , composition v0v for any v , 96 Morl Ha and identity morphisms
IdT for all T ~ ObTHa .  ? 5 . The main property of THa The heterogeneuous si tuation  , where the language carrying system uses not only one language to describe the environment world can be described by EO as the category TH ~  . Note that TH~contains all possible h ierarchies  , because the connection between any two consti tuents is but an element of M or TH a  . Thema the-matical object TH a provides the usage of the apparatus of category theory to analyse the properties of language hierarchies  . Moreover this frame allows us to establish connection between any two theories even if there is not any kind of direct relation between them  . 
In the latter case a " resultant " theory should be constructed which has direct connection with original ones and the power of express ion of which joins that of the original ones  . This " resultant " theory mediates between the or iginal directly unconnected theories  . 
Note that the construction of a resultant theory to some given unconnected theories is one of  . the most important tasks of the General System Theory  ( see e . g .  \[2\]) . 
The following theorem claims the completeness of IHa  ( in the sense of \[4\] or \[5\] )  . This notion corresponds ( in category theory ) to the above expected property . 
Theorem 3.
( i ) The category TH~of all theories is complete and cocomplete  . 
( ii ) There is an effective procedure to construct the limits and colimits of the effectively given diagrams in TH ~  .  @
Now we enlight the notions used in the above theorem  . 
A diagram D in TH a is a directed graph whose arrows are labelled by morphisms u : Ti ~ Tj of Mor /Ha and the nodes by the corresponding objects  ( Ti , TjEObTHa ) . 
Examp ! es(i)m ~ TI(2) ~1 (3) v1 ~ TI
To__m/To ~ TITo/~2-L1 ~ ; 2'~2~""~=T2(where T0 , TI , T2E Ob IH a ~ I , v26 Morl Ha ) are diagrams . 
Here the identity morphisms Id T3_(i = O , i , 2) are omitted for clarity . We indicate the identity morphisms only if they are needed  . ? Definition 8 . ( cone , lim ~ t , colimit )
A cone over a diagram D is a family a . : T-T . -T . is object of D of morphisms 1 i " 1 . from a single ob3ect T such that T6ObTH ~ , for anyie . CM or IHa and for any morphisms T . ! ~ T . of Daj = aio ~ in THa ~ jiT . \]( i . e . T~I3 commutes) . 
ai ~- ~ Ti
The l~mit of a diagram D in TH~is a cone a . : T~T . : T . is object of D\] over D such thalt fop anly other coneSi:R ~ Ti : Ti is object of D\]over D there is a unlque morphism v : R ~ T such that 
Bi = ~ oai ?
The colimit of D is defined exectly as above but all the arrows are reversed  .  ?
Definition 9. ( complete , cocomplete)
A category K is said to be complete and cocomplete if for every diagram D in K both the limit and the colimit of D exist in K  .  ?
By aboves we see that Theorem 3 says that every diagram in IH a has both limit and colimit in THa  . I . e . in the category THa of all theories all possi- blelimits and colimits exist  ( and can be constructed )   . 
Now let us see some

Xo + X1 = X1 + Xo ?
Let ~: To ~ TI and ~: To-TI be two theory morphisms such that for some mEv and  n6~ we have m ( R ( xo , xl )) = Xo + X1 = Xl and n(R(xo , xl )) = Xo + X1 = Xo . 
A . Consider the diagram To . . . ._.

Proof of B:
The proof is based on the fact that

Many further interesting features of TH a could be detected had we no limits of our paper  . 
6. Instead of conclusion
In aboves MTS attitude has been equipped with new tools which might allow the investigation of both natural and artificial languages at such a level of complexity that approx imates the real situations  . We believe that these open up new perspectives for MTS in the investigation of both computa-t ional and theoretical linguistics  . 
E . g . MTS may provide a description in each case where the connection between two or more sub languages play a significant role  . We think that this is the case in the semantica l investi-gation of certain types of humor as well  , where humor might appear by unusual interpret at ions of texts  . This can be described by establishing the connection between the corresponding theories that represent knowledge  , i . e . 
presupositions . The following jokes reflect the aforement ioned type : l  . " Why didn't youcome to the last meeting ?"" Had I known it was the last I would have come  . " 2 . Two men were discussing a third . 
" He think she is a wit " said one of them.
"Yes " , replied the other , " but he is only half right "
