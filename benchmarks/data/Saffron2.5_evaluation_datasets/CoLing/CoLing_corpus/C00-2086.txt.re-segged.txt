1 Introduction
Sentences with e o or ( lination ( : ontaillmultil ) lephrases of like syntact i (  ; tyl)e . When the given sentence shows struct m'a lambig 'lfit  ; y , tiler ( ; may 1 ) emult ii ) le pairs of candidates tbrl ) ossil ) le con-juncts/disjuncts , usually a single pair of which is identified as intended by human language un-derstanders  , l ? arsing for coordination should thus find the exact syntactic t  ) oundaries of these " intended " conjuncts / ( lisjuncts . Previous workeln ployed a 1 ) reproccs sing module for parsing to work on a constrained range of the candidate conjmwts /disjuncts  ( Kurohashi & Nagao ,  1994;
Yang , 1995; Okmnura & Muraki , 1994).
Coml ) inatory categorial grammars ( Steedman ,  1990 ;  2000 ) arc known to explain a wide range of syntactic phenon mna  , such as coordination , extraction and long distance dependency , without employing the no ~ ions of movement and empty categories  . While CCGs oiler explanations ibr various natural language phenomena with limited combinatory rules such ms typeraising and flmction composition  , these are also wellknown to increase the complexity of parsing  , giving rise to quite a few irrelevant syntactic analyses as well as relew mtones ~ a phenomenon often called as spm ' ious ambiguity  . 
In this paper , we propose to address the two types of ambiguity with predicate argument structures and semantic cooccurrence similarity intbrmation  . 1 For a more concrete discussion , we focus in this paper on coordination in Korean . First , related work is reviewed in i2 . 
The two types of an fl ) iguity arc then discussed in !3 . We also examine the characteristics of coordination in a  ( : or tms in ?4 . In ?5 , we show ore : proposal to enhance t ) arsing efficiency , with encouraging ext ) erimental results . 
2 Related Work 2 . 1 Conjunct Identification First , we review three of the techniques that attempt to narrow down the candidate con  . juncts . 
2.1.1 Complex Information
At ) t ) roaches that use conlplex information are baaed on the assmnl  ) tion that there are various clues for morphological and semanticsire-ilarity between the pair of matching con-juncts/disjuncts  . The usual measure tbr such similarity includes the part-of-st  ) eech ( pos ) tea-ture int brmation . The proposal by Agarwal and Boggess ( 1992 ) for English coordination utilizes a semi-parser ibr the assignment of pertinent semantic and morphologic Minibrmation to each lexical item in a given sentence  . The procedure for the conjunct/disjunct identification with this infbrmation is sunnnarized below  . 
1 . Keel ) pushing the lexical items in a given sentence into the stack until a coordination item such as and  , or , but , etc , is encountered . 
1This work was supported by the Korea Science and Engineering Foundation  ( KOSEF ) through AIT rc . The second author is now with SK Telctcch in Korea  . 
593 2 . With the coordination item , treat he immediately following phrase as the post -conjunct/disjuuct  . 
3 . Pop the lexical items fi'om the stack one by one , comparing their morphological nd/or semantic t batures with those of the post-conjunet /disjunct  . 
The reported precision is 81% , but the method identifies only tile starting positions of the con-juncts/disjuncts  . 
The method proposed by Okumura and Mu-ram ( 1994 ) for English coordination looks into the symmetric patterns of conjuncts/disjuncts  . 
These symmetric patterns are classified into tbur categories : phrasal/clausal patterns  , lexical patterns , morphological patterns , and complex patterns . The first ; three patterns are defined in terms of the respective features in lexical items  . The best match among all the possible word sequences with these features before and after the coordination item is passed over to the parser  . The reported precision is 75% . 
This method assigns various weights to the features t br the measure of the symmetric patterns  . It is not ( : lear if the weight assigmnent method is principled and if it can also address conjuncts /disjuncts with ellipsis  . 
2.1.2 Co-Occurrence Information
Yang ( 1995 ) utilized cooccurrence information tbr the resolution of structural ambiguity in Korean noun phrase coordination  . The method looks ut ) the related pair of nouns and verbs ti'om a large corpus and uses the statistics on the case inibn nation of the nouns with respect to the given verb for the similarity information among nouns  . The cooccurrence similarity DSim(rq , n2) between the nouns n , and n2 is defined as t bllows , which incorporate stile prediction that the similarity of the two nouns is higher when they are more frequently used with the same verb of the same syntactic ategory  . 
2. n2) l
DSim(nl , u2)-+ . cal Vg(n2) l where 2? G=-subj , obj , loca , last , modi?Vg(n ) =- v\[v is a verb such that fg(n , v ) > 1? I ~( , ~) l = E~v . ( , , ) f . (~ , v)2 fe(n , v ) is then unlber of times that noun n of type g occurs with verb vintlmst one sentence in a corpus  . 
? IC ~ , ( , ~ , , , ~=) l-Eminf~(ni , v ) , fg(n2 , v)veCVg(at , n2) This method makes it ; possible to resolve the syntactic ambiguity due to coordination i Korean as illustrated in  ( 1 ) and ( 2 )  . a DSim is used to predict correctly that ' suthayk '  ( stack ) is in coordination with ' khyu ' ( queue ) and not with ' yey ' ( example )  . Likewise , ' kyesan ' ( computation ) and ' thmn say k ' ( search ) are correctly identified to be in coordination with each other  . 
(1 ) suthayk-~-?\]khyu-uyeystack-co queue-poss exmnplcexaInple  ( s ) of stack ( s ) and queue ( s ) 
DSim(suttr,~yk,khyu ) = 0.319

DSim(kyeysan , pekheys ) = 0.024
DSim(kyeysan , tham say k ) = 0.303
DSim(kyeysan , sikan ) = 0.067
In addition to the fact that the method mays nf fer from data sparseness  , it is also not directly ~ pplicable when nouns are polysemous or when the conjunct/disjunct nouns have weak semantic similarity  ( cf .  (3)) .

We note that this cooccurrence similarity information is useful when largescale linguistic knowledge bases such as WordNet are not available for the language in question  . 
2.1.3 Part-Of-Speech Patterns
The method with pos patterns ( Park ,  1998 ) extracts sentences with coordination from a pos tagged corpus  , trains the system with the pos patterns of the left - and right-conjuncts/disjuncts  , and resolves the ambiguity with trained pos patterns  ( cf .  (4)) .

The reported precision is 71 . 6% . When there is structural anfl ) iguity ms shown in ( 5 ) below , however , it is difficult to identi\[y the right conjunct if the system considers only posinibrmation  , where the longest match is ' mangko-luls wuipha -mmnala '  ( the nation that imports mangos )  , not the intended hnangko ' ( mango ) .

3 Two Types of Ambiguity 3 . 1 Spurious Ambiguity CCGs provide two syntactic derivations t br the semantically unaml  ) iguous sentence ( 8 )  , as shown in (9) and (10) .

While the semantics makes it clear that only the derivation  2 is the intended one , it is impossible for a parser with only syntactic information to tell the difference  . Notice that this problem is not mfique to a CCG -based parser  . 
While the general solution would obviously require not only semantic infbrmation but  , also pragmatic and discourse information , we examine approaches that take into account only semantic information in this paper  . 
4 Coordination in Corpus
In an attemp to assess the coordination phe -nolne nonin ~ trealistic manner  , we examine a postagged corpus available at KAIST . The corpus contains newspaper articles (40 , 428 eojeol ) , essays (41 , 666 eojeol ) , textbooks (50 , 208 eojeol ) , technical documents (2 , 729 eojeol ) , novels (40 , 498 eojeol ) , with the total of 175 , 524 eojeol and 17 , 123 sentences . ~ Table 4 shows the types 5Eojeol is a unit in Korean that roughly corresponds to space-delimited words in English  . Each eoje ol contains both the stem and its morphological endings  .

Table 3: Example Structural Ambiguity and frequencies of sentences containing coordination in this corpus  . We used PERL scripts to narrow down the sentences meeting certain basic conditions for coordination and manually identified sentences with coordination among those chosen  . G Table 4 indicates that coordination is used quite often in Korean  . 
5 Parsing for Coordination
In this section , we present echniques of dealing with coordination for efficient : parsing  . 
6 A postagged corpus does not , give sufficient information for the fully automatic dentification of sentences with coordination  , since we also need to take the sentential semantics into account  .

As discussed , the l ) resence of Slm-rious ambiguity in a given sentence ibrcesre-t  ) eated syntactic analyses for fragments with identical semantics  . This can be avoided if we use the same cell to record the synta  ( : tie analyses with the same semantics . 7 CCG makes this 1) ossit)le , as both the syntactic and semantic derivations are constructed in tmldeln  . Table 5 shows part of the t ) arsing table for (13) . The tbl-lowing shows the relevant syntactic categories  .

Among the pairs of head nouns of can-didal ; econjuncts/disjuncts , al ) out 88 . 1% pairs are identified as semantical ly related in our corpus  . It is thus reasonable to consider only those candidates with some semantic relation  . We use the following mod-itication of Yang's ( 1995 ) original proposal . 
rCLK a , rttmmn , 1989; Eisner , 1996; Komagata ,   1999   1 Whenever the coordination reduction rule is invoked  , check the syntactic ategories of the candidate conjuncts  . 
2 If they are nouns or noun phrases , skip to the next step . Otherwise write them to n cell . 
3 Locate the head nouns in the candidate conjuncts . 
4 Comlmte the cooccurrence similarity of the head l tO l l l lS  . 
5 If the coordinatioi ~ reduction rule has already been applied to the he  . adnoun of the left candidate conjunct ~ compare the cooccurrences iinilarity of the recorded and the new  . If the cooccurrence similarity of the newly identified candidate con-j  , mcts is stronger , write them to a cell , and delete the existing candidates in the cell . Otherwise , discard the new and retain the old . 
6 U 1 ) datc the list of conjuncts whenever there is a newly recorded candidate conjunct  . 
For the cooccurrence similarity intbrmation between ll Oill lS  , we used another KAIST cor-tins that is ln a , mMly tree-tagged ( Lee ,  1998) . It contain sal ) out 31 , 000 sentences with 352 , 730 eojeol . The average sentence length is 11 . 35 words . The domains include news t ) at ) ereditorials , economy , religion , science fiction , exl ) edi-tion , novels , and history . We have considered only nominative , accusative , adverbial , complement , and adnominal cases in relation to the verbs tbr the extraction of co-occm:rence similarity intbrmation  , which is then recorded into a dictionary and is looked ll  t3  \[ ) y the parser when it deals with coordination . 
5.2.2 Thesaurus
The use of cooccurrence similarity information as in  ( Yang , 1995) suffers ti'om data sparseness , especially since we have a relatively small corpus with fairly unrestricte domains  , sFor instance ,   ( 15 ) and ( 16 ) below show examples of wrong cooccurrence similarity intbrmation  .

And in (16) , the number of verbs that occur with ' cangsink wu '   ( accessory ) is smaller than that of the verbs that occur with other nouns  . 
Both result in a wrong analysis . We can use a thesaurus to address this problem . 
In a thesaurus , words in the same class are assumed to have related meanings  . We can use these class-mate words to compensate tbr data sparseness  . In constructing a lexicon , we consult the thesaurus when then mnber of verbs that occur with a given noun falls below a threshold  , and let the noun share the data with those in the same class  . The thesaurus has the ' word-meaning code ' tbrmat  . The present he-saurus contain slightly more than 1000 nouns that are mammlly constructed . The classification follows the NTT hierarchy . We have assigned meaning codes to only the most frequently used meanings tbrpolysemous entries  .
