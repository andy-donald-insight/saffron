Abstract
We describe an information extraction system in which four classes of naming expressions organisation  , person , location and tinm names are recognised and classified with nearly  92% combined precision and recall . The system applies a mixture of techniques to perform this task and these are described in detail  . We have quantitatively evaluated the system against a blind test set of Wall Street Journal business articles and report results not only for the system as a whole  , but for each component technique and for each class of name  . These results show that in order to have high recall  , the system needs to make use not only of information internal to the naming expression but also information from outside then mne  . 
They also show that the contribution of each system component w ~ riesfl ' om one  ( : lass of name expression to another . 
1 Introduction
The appropriate treatment of proper names is essential in a natural language understanding system which processes unedited newswire text  , since up to 10 % of this type of text may consist of proper names  ( Coates-Stephens ,  1992) . Noris it only the sheer volume of names that makes them important  ; for some applications , such as information extraction ( IE ) , robust handling of proper names is a prerequisite for successflfly performing other tasks such as template filling where correctly identifying the entities which play semantic roles in relational frames is crucial  . Recent research in the fifth and sixth Message Understanding Conferences  ( MUC5 , 1993) ( MUC6 ,  1995 ) has shown that the recognition and classification of proper names in business newswire text can now be done on a large scale and with high accuracy : the success rates of the best systems now approach  96%  . 
We have developed an IE system-LaSIf ( Large Scale Information Extraction )   ( Gaizauslmsctal ,  1995 ) which extracts important facts from tmsiness newswire texts  . As a key part of the extraction task , the system recognises and classifies certain types of naming expressions  , namely those specified in the MUC6 named entity ( NE ) task definition ( MUC6 ,  1995) . These include organisation , person , and location names , time expressions , percentag expressions , and monetary amount expressions . As defined for MUC6 , the first three of these are proper names , the fourth contains some expressions that would be classified as proper names by linguists and some that  ; would not , while the last two would generally not be thought of as proper names  . In this paper we concentrate only the behaviour of the LaSIE system with regards to recognising and classifying expressions in the first four classes  , i . e . those which consistentirely or in part of proper names  ( though nothing hangs on omitting the others )  . The version of the system reported here achieves ahnost  92% combilm dprecision and recall scores on this task against blind test data  . 
Of course the four name classes mentioned are not the only classes of proper names  . Brandnarnes , book and movie names , and ship names are . just a few further classes one might chose to identify  . One might also want to introduce subclasses within the selected classes  . We have not dones ohere for two reasons . First , and foremost , in order to generate quantitative valuation results we have used tile  MUC6 data and scoring resources and these restrict us to the above proper name classes  . Secondly , these four name classes account for the bulk of proper name occurrences in business newswire text  . Our approach could straightforwardly be extended to account for additional classes of proper nalnes  , and the points we wish to make about tile approach can be adequately presented using only this restricted set  . 
Our approach to proper name recognition is heterogeneous  . We take advantage of grapholo-gical , syntactic , semantic , world knowledge , and discourse level information to perform the task  . In the paper we present details of the approach , describing those data and processing componm~ts of the overall IE system which contribute to proper name recognition and classification  . Since name the activity of four successive components in the system  , we quantitative lyew fluatetile successive contribution of each comt  ) onent in our overall approach . We perform this analysis not only for all classes of names  , but for each class separately . 
The , resulting analysis 1 . supports McDonald's obse , rvation(McDoi > aid ,  1993 ) that external evidence as well as internal evidence is essential for achieving high precision and recall ill the recognition and classification task  ; i . e . not just the name string itself must be examined , but other information in the text must be used as well  ;  2 . shows that alleo Inponents in our heterogen-eous apt  ) roach contribute significantly ;  3 . shows that not all classes of prot ) ernaines benefit equally h'om the contritmtions of the different colnponents in our system : in particular  , organisation amest ) en ef it most from the use of external evidence . 
In tile second section an overview of the I , a SIE system is presented . The third section explains in detail how proper names are reeognised and classified in the system  . The results of evaluating the system on a blind test set  ; of 30 articles are presented and discussed in section 4  . Section 5 concludes the paper .

Figure 1: LaSIE Systeln Architecture
LaSIE has been designed as a general tmrpose IE research system  , initially geared towards , but not solely restricted to , carrying out the tasks specified by the sixth Message Understanding Confe  , r-ence:named entity recognition , coreference resol-ution , template lementilling , and scenario template filling tasks ( see ( MUC6 ,  1995 ) for fllrther details of the task descriptions )  . In addition , the system can generate a brief natural anguage summary of the scenario it  . has detected in the text . 
All of these tasks are carried out by building a single rich i node l of the text the discourse model from which the various results are read oil  . 
Tile high level structure of LaSIE is illustrated in Figure  1  . The system is a pipelined architecture which processes a text sentence-at-a-time and consists of three principal processing stages : lexical preproeessing  , parsing plus semant ; ic inter -- pretation , and discourse interpretation . The overall contributions of these stages may be briefly described as follows : ? lexl calp reproeessing reads and tokenise stile raw inlmt text  , tags the toke , ns with parts-of-speech , t ) e , r forms mor I ) hological analysis , Imrt brms phrasal matching against lists of proper names  , and builds lexical and phrasal chart edges in a h '  . ature-based formalism for hand over to the parser ; ? parsing does two pass parsing , pass one with a special proper name grairlmal ' ~ pass two with a general grammar and  , after selecting a ' best parse ' , passes on a semantic representation of the current senteli C  ( ~ which includes nanle clans in fi ) rmation ; ? discourse interpretation adds the information illits input semantic representation to a hierarchically structured selnantic ne  , t which encodes the system's world model , adds additional ilffOl ' , n atioi1 presupposed by the input to the world model , perforlns coreference resolution be , tween new instances and others already ill the world model  , and adds information consequent upon the addition of the input to the worhl I node l  . 
For fltr ther det ~ fils of the systeln see ( Gaizauskasctal ,  1 . 995) . 
3 How proper names are recognised and classified As indicated in section  1  , our approach is a heterogeneous one ill which the system makes use of graI  ) hological , syntactic , selnantic , world knowledge , , and discourse level intb , ' mation for the recognition and classification of proper names  . The system utilises both the information which comes fl ' oln the name its e  . lf ( internal evidence ill McDon-ald's sense ( McDonaht ,  1993 ) ) as well as tile information which colnes from outside  , the name , froln its context in the text : ( external evidence )  . 
In what t bllows we describe how proper names are recognised and classified in LaSIE by considering the contribution of each system component  . 
3.1 Lexieal preproeessing
The input text is first tokenise . d and then each token is tagged with a part-of -stmechtag from the  , Pennqt Yeebank tagset ( Marcusctal ,  1993 ) using a slightly custolnised ~ version of Brill ' s  tag-1The tagger has been : customised by adding some entries to its lexicon and by adding several special tags fin'proper nouns NNP for singular proper nouns and I~NPS for plurals  . The tagger tags a word as a proper noun as follows : if the word is timnd in the tagger's lexicon and listed as a proper noun then tag it  , as such ; otherwise , if the word is not found in the lexicon and is uppercase initial then tag it as a proper noun  . Thus , capitalised unknown tokens are tagged as proper nouns by default  . 
Before parsing an attempt is made to identi\[y proper naine phrases sequences of proper names and to classify them  . This is done by matching tile input against prestored lists of propernalnes  . 
The . selists are compiled via a flex program into a finite state recogniser  . Each sentence is fed to the recogniser and all single and multiword matches are tagged with special tags which indicate the name  ( : lass . 
Lists of names used include : ? organisation : about  2600 company and governmental institution nmnesbased on an organisation amelist which was semi -automatically collected from the  MUC-5 answer keys and training corl ) us ( Wall Street
Journal articles ) ; ?location : about 2200 major country , province ~ state , and city names derived fl'o magazetteer list of about  150  , 000 place naines ; ? person : about 500 given names taken Domalist ; of given names in the Oxford Advanced
Le . arner's Dictionary ( Hornby , 1980); ? eompmly designator : 94 designators ( e . g . 
' Co .  '  , ' PLC') , based on the company designator list provided in the  MUC6 reference resources . 
? human titles : about 160 titles , ( e . g . ' Presid-ent ',' Mr .  ')  , manually collected ; As well as name phrase matching , another technique is applied at this point , inside multiword proper names , certain words m~yflmction as triq-getwords . A trigger word indicates that the tokens surrounding it are ' probably a proper name and may reliably pernfit the class or even subclass  2 of tile proper nmne to be determined . For example , ' Wing and l'r wer Airlines'is ahnost certainly a company  , given tile presence of the word ' Airlines ' . ~ Digger words are detected by matching against , lists of such words and are then specially tagged  . Subsequently these tags are used by the proper nmne parser to build complex proper name constituents  . 
The lists of trigger words are : ? A Mine company :   3 trigger words for finding airline company names , e . g . ' Airlines ' ; ? Governmental institutions : 7 trigger words for governmental institutions , e . g ' Ministry ' ; for word classe such as days of the week and months  . 
2company and governmental institution are subclasses of the class organisation  , airline is a subclass of company . 
? Location : 8 trigger words for location nanle , s , e . g . ' Gulf ' ; ? Organisation : 135 trigger words for organisation names , e . g ' Association ' . 
These lists of trigger words were produced by hand  , though the organisation trigger word lists were generated semi-automatically blooking at organisatio names in tile  MUC6 training texts and applying certain heuristics . So , for example , words were ( : ollected which come inmm diately before ' of ' in those organisatio names whiche Oll-tain'of '  , e . g . ' Association ' in ~ Assoeiation of Air Flight Attendants '  ; lhelast ; words of organisation names which do not contain ' of ' were examined to find trigge  . r words like ' International ' . 
3 . 2 Grammar ru les lbr proper names The LaSIE parser is a simple bottom-up chart parser i inplemented in Prolog  . The grammars it processes are unification-style feature-based context  , fl'ee grammars . During parsing , semantic representations of constituents are constructed using Prologter in unification  . When parsing : eases , i . e . 
when the parser can generate no further edges , a ' best parse selection ' algorithm is rm lon the final chart to chose ~ single analysis  . The semantics are then extracted fl ' om this analysistrod passed onto the discourse interpreter  . 
Parsing takes place in two passes , each using a separate grammar . In the first pass a special grammar is used to identify proper nanms  . 
These constituents are then treated as unanalys -able units during the second pass which employs a more general'sentence'grammar  . 
Proper Name Grammar The gramma rules for proper names constitute a subset of the sys-tem's noun t  ) hrase . ( NP ) rules . All the rules were produ(:ed1) y h and . There are 177 such rules ill total of which 94 are for organisation , 54 for person , 11 for location , and 18 for time exl ) ressions . 
Here are some examt ) les of the i ) roper nmnegramma rules :
NP --> 0KGAN NP 0RGAN NP-->LIST_LOC NPNA MES_NP CDG NP 0RGAN_NP  -->  LIST_0RGAN_NP NAME S NP CD G_NP
ORGAN_NP-->NAMES NP'&'NAMES_NP
NAME S_NP-->NNP NAME S_NP
NAME S_NP-->NNPPUNC(_) NNP
NAME SNP - -> NNP
The nonterminals LIST_LOCJNP ~ LIST_0RGAN_NP and CDG~IP are tags assigned to one or l nor ( ~ input tokens in the name phrase tagging stage of lexical preproeessing  . The nonterminal NNP is the tag for proper name assigned to a single token by the Brill tagger  . 
The rule 0RGAN_hIP --> NAMES_NP'&'NAMES_NP means that if an as yet unclassified or ambiguous proper name  ( NANES ~ P ) is followed by '&' and another mn biguous proper nmne  , then it is an organisation ame . So , for example , ' Marks & Spell-tie (: lassilic das(/rganisat , i(m names by this rule .

4 Results and Evaluation
After these processing stages , the results generator produces a version of the original text in which all the proper names which have been detec-ted are marked up with predefined SGML tags  , specifying their classes . These marked up texts are then automatically scored against manually marked up texts  . 
A series of evaluations has been done on tile system using a blind test set consisting of  30 Wall Street Journal texts . In these texts there are 449 organisation ames , 373 person names , and 110 location names and 111 time expressions in total . 
The overall precision and recall scores for the four classes of proper naines are shown in Table  1  . 
Proper Naine Class Recall Precision
Organisation 91% 91% l'erson 90% 95%
Location 88% 89%
Time 94% 97%
Overall 91% 93%
Table 1: Overall Precision and Recall Scores 4 . 1 System modu le cont r ibut ion We have analysed tile results in terms of how much each module of the system contributes to the propernmnet ask  . 
Table 2 illustrates the contribution of each system module to the task for all classes of proper names  . In addition to recall and t ) recision scores , we have added VanRijsbergen's Fmeasure which combines these scores into a single measure  ( Rijsbergen ,  1979) . The Fmeasure ( also called P&R ) allows the differential weighting of precision and recall  . With precision and recall weighted equally it is computed by the formula:  2 x Precision x Recall

Precision + Recall
There are tour different settings of the system.
? setting 1 : Only the lexical preprocessing tee hifiques are used tmrt-of-speeeh tagging and name phrase matching  . 
? setting 2: Two-stage parsing is added to 1.
? setting 3 : Coreference resolution for proper names is added to  2  . 
? setting 4 : Full discourse interpretation is added to 3  . This is the fullfledged system Setting1 ~\[-Recall IPrecisi ? n49 N 89  ~  7-? -N 94 ~~ A 94 
Table 2: Module Contribution Scores
Table 2 shows thai ; we can attain reasonable results using tagging , exact , phrase matching , trigger word detection , and parsing ( setting 2) . Note that this amounts to making use of only internal evidence  . However , to achieve higher recall , we need coreferencer solution for proper names ( setting 3 ) and other context information ( setting 4 )  . 
4 . 2 Dif ferent classes of p roper names We have also examined how the contribution of each component varies from one class of proper nanm to another  . 
For organisation names , using the same settings as above , scores are shown in Table 3 .

5 Conclusion
We have described an IE system in which four classes of naming expressions  ( organisation , person , and location names and time expressions ) are recognised and classified . The system was tested Oil 30 unseen Wall Street Journal texts and the results were analysed in terms of in a jor system components and ditti~rent  ( : lasses of referring expression .
