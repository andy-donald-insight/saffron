From a well represented sample of world languages Steele  ( 1978 ) shows that about 70% of languages exhibit significant word order variation  . Only recently has this wl de-spread phenomenon been drawing appropriate attention  . 
Perhaps ID/LP ( Immediate Dominance and Linear Precedence ) framework is the most debated theories in this area  . We point out some difficulties in processing standard ID/LP grammar and present a modif ied version of the grammar  . In the modified version , the right hand side of phrase structure rules is treated as a set or partially ordered set  . An instance of the framework is implemented . 
1. Introduction
From a well represented sample of world languages Steele  ( 1978 )  ~ , ~ hows that about 76~ of the languages exhibit significant word order variation  . Until recently thls widespread phenomenon was not given proper attention in natural language processing  . The primary goal of tb is study is to develop eomput at lonally efficient and linguistical lyadequate strategles for parsing word order variation  . The strategies are implemented in a network based parser  . At first we characterize the basic problem at an abstract level without going into detai ls of the problem in any specific language  ( in Section-2 )  . Then ~ in Sectlon-3 , the details of the problems in a specific language ~ namely ~ Iilndi ~ are presented  . 
The Immediate dominance and linear precedence ( ID/LP ) framework ~ developed by Gazdar and Pullum ~ is one of the most debated theories in thes tudy of word order variation  ( Pullum 1982 ~ Uszkorelt 1082 , Shieber 1983 , Barton 1985) . 
The basic idea behind ID/LP framework is to separate immediate dominance from linear precedence in rewrite rules  . 
Pullum (1982) expresses this via a metagrammar . The modified version presented in this paper expresses this directly in the object g rammar eliminating the need for a metagrammar  . It treats the right hand side of a PS ( Phrase Structure ) rule as a set or partially ordered set . Parsing with this type of rule can proceed by checking set membership  . 
2 . The Word Order Problem in General The word order problem is the problem of processing the whole range of word order variation occurr ing in natural languages  . Some Australian language such as Warlpiri show extreme word order variation  ( Hale 1983 )  . Hindi , Japanese and German also allow considerable word order variation  . In this section we develop descriptive fo rmalisms and parsing mechanisms that are adequate for the whole range of word order varia tion  . 
Consider a grammar th dt allows a node labeled S to have daughters labeled $  , O , and ? in any linear order ~ and nothing else . Such a grammar can be presented with a set of rules such as that given in  ( 2 . 1) . 
(2.1) S-->$OV,S-->$VO,S-->0SV,
S --> OV $, S - -> V$O , S-->VO $
The problem with a grammar such as that given in  ( 2 . 1 ) is that i ~ needs too many rules to capture word order variation  ( in this case free word order )   . For 5 ' words'such a grammar will need 5!  =  120 rules . With the increase in the number of words , such a graln mar will grow factorially . That is , for a number of words it will needn/rules . 
There is a convYnient way of ' collapsing ' rules in GPSG  ( Generalized Phrase Structure Grammar ) of Gazder ( 1981 )  . It uses metarules that operate on basic rules to generate derived rules which then function as basic rules in derivations  . Thus , (2 . 1) can be abbreviated as (2 . 2) . 
(2.2) Basic rule :\[_~$ OV\]
Metarule : \[5 . . . .X . . . Y . . . \ ] = :>\[ S . . . .y . . . X . . . \] where X and Y range over $, O , V . 
Within GPSG Pullmn ( 1982 ) suggests another solution which also involves a metagrammar  , tie suggests that a grammar such as (2 . 1 ) can be expressed via a metagrammar that treats immediate dominance and linear precedence separately  . Pullum's theory is known as ID/LP analysis 2 According to this theory grammar ( 2 . 1 ) " would be specified by means of the metagrammar " given in  ( 2 . 3) . Similarly j the metagrammar given in (2 . 4) " determines " the grammar shown in (2 . 5) . In (2 . 3) and (2 . 4) i .   .   .   .   . diated oml .   .   .   . estar .   .   .   . ts are given under a ~ and linear precedences tatements are given ~ under b  . In the case of (2 . 3 ) however the set of linear precedences ta tements is empty  . In the case of (2 . 4 )  $  ( Omeans'it " any rule introduces $ and O , $ linearly precedes O ' . 
(2 . 3) a . S - ->$ , O , V b .  $ (2 . 4) a . S - ->$, O , V h . (* < O(2 . 5) ( s -> . * ov , s ->$ vo , s->v $ oAn important advantage of ID/LP analysis is that it can account for word order variation in a general way  , capturing " analytical intultion ~ often hinted at in the literature  , that fixing constituent order " costs " in the same way that having special NP case-mark ing rules or verb agreement rules does "  ( Pnllum 1982:211 )  . The main disadvantage of the standard ID/LP framework is th ~: t it is difficult to process  ( Shieber 1983 , Barton 1985) . 
The alternative solution proposed in this s tudy treats the rigbth and side of a rule as a  set3   . Thus ~ the grammar in (2 . 1) can be p .   .   .   .   . ted in this format , eith .   .   .   .  (2 . 6a ) or as (2 . 6b ) . The latter rule is to be understood under the node admissibility condition  . 
(2.a)a . S ->($, o , vb . (5$'?' v
Since the right hand side of the rule is as eG the order of $ ~ O and V does not matter  . In parsing , this solution has definite advantages . Firstly ~ the factorial growth of rules is el iminated  . Secondly ~ parsing can proceed by checking set membership or set difference  . That is , instead of ' ordered match ' the parser has to do ' unordered match '  . The precise way of doing it will vary from parser to parser  . We describe one way of implementing it in the ATN  ( Augmented Transition Network ( Woods 1970 , Finln and Hadden 1977)) formalism . 
Consider the ATN fragment presented below in (2 . 7) for the grammar given in (2 . 6) . Conditions on are are given in . 
LISP like structures within parenthesis . Thus ( null $ ) means ' if will be accepted if no $ has previously been found  . (In natural language , one can assume $ ~ Subject , O~Object , V = Verb , and use PUSH arc in place of WRD in the fol lowing diagram  . ) (2 . 7)
WRD,(N~LL~:23WRDO(NULL_O)//
WRDV ( NULLV ) J ~ 4 POP ( NOT NULL $ ) ( NOTNULL O )   ( NOT NULLV ) ~  ( 2 . 7) parses any strings generated by (2 . 1 ) by scanning the input from left to right and checking the set membership  . 
Thus , in recognition and parsing , (2 . 7) correctly reflects (2 . 0) . 
Suppose , the input string is VO $ . One way to see how a sentence is parsed is to t race through the analysis of the sentence as are sequence  . This string is accepted by the arc sequence (3 ,  2 ,  1 ,  4) . The ATN given in (2 . 7 ) can be said to have conditioned multiple loops  . For convenience of reference , we shall refer to ATN structure such as (2 . 7) as ' set-loops ' . Further restrictions on set-loops ( such as ( 2 . 7 ) ) can be imposed and all const i tuent order var ia t ions can be parsed s imply by impos ing add i t iona l condit ions on arcs  . Thus , an ATN parser such as (2 . 8b ) can parse the language generated by the grammar given in  ( 2 . 5) . Formally , (2 . 5 ) is presented with a partially ordered set such as  ( 2 . 8 a ) in the proposed framework . The partial ordering is specified as a const rain after "/" ~ as in a context-sensit lve rule contexts are specified after "/''  .

Suppose that $ , O , and V are nontermlnals which are further expanded by appropriate rewrite rules  . Righthand side of such expansions can also show word order variations as shown in  ( 2 . 9) . 
(2 . 9)$--:> a , b , c , O-->(d , e , V - - ~> f , g , hSo far , we have described parsing strategies for const ituent order variations  . However , in natural language we often find a discont inuous constituent  . That is , an element can be moved out of its consti tuent  ( top l calization in English would be a good example if VP is a constituent  ) which can be described by categories with holes  ( eg . VP/NP ) . In cases such as this , VIR arcs in combination with hold lists arc used in ATN  ( Bates 1978 )  . Alternatively , temporary registers can be used to parse discont inuous constituents  . Temporary ' misplaced ' words that cannot be handled by usual HOLD lists in combination with VIR arcs  . We would llke to apply the general strategies described above to the case of Hindi which shows considerable word order variation  . 
3. Word Order in Hindi
In Hindl , the order of the major constituents such as $ ( Subject )  , O(directObject) , I(Indirect object ) , and V ( V erb(+aux )) is free . For example , out of the four constituents present in (3 . 11 . 1) , we can make twenty four variants of the same senteneep all of which are perfectly good in Hindi as is obvious from  ( 3 . 11 . 1-24) . 
(3 . 11/1 . mohanner aamkosev dlaathaa . ($ IOV /
MohanagRam to apple gave was " Mohan gave the apple to Ram  . " 2 . mohanner aamko dlaathaasev . ($ IVO ) 3 . mohanne diaathanraamkosev . ($ VIO ) 4 . mohannedia a thansevraamko . ($ VOI ) 24 . diaathaase vmohanner aamko . ( VO$I ) To capture the freedom of order of $ , I , O ~ and V in sentence such as (3 . 11) We can have a rule such as (3 . 12) in the grammar of Hindl . The Valone can stand as a sentence in Hindi since it is highly inflected  ( see Kachru 1980 )  . Hence (3 . 13) is more appropriate for Hindi where $ ~ I , and O are given within paratheses to show the i roptional occurrence  . 
(3 . 12) ( S~'I'O'V (3 . 13) ( ~ ( , ) , ( I ) , ( o ) , v We have been referring to rules such as (3 . 13/asset rules . An ATN fragment , such as (3 . 14) would be appropriate for (3 . 13 / . 
ICPUSHCNULL , I_j // 5 POP ( NOT NULLV ) f ( Assume appropriate subnets for $ , I , O , V ) Suppose we are parsing (3 . 11 . 1 ) mohaancraamkosevdia athan " Mohan gave the apple to Ram "  . It is accepted by the arc seq .   .   .   .   .  (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) . The sentence given in (3 . 11 . 24) is accepted by the arc sequence (3 ,  1 ,  4 ,  2 ,  51  .  (3 . 14 ) captures constituent order variation in Hindlina general way  . 
However , it is to be noted that sentence such as (3 . 11 . 1 ) have bl-transltive ( or double transitive ) V . We have to impose more conditions on arc 5 , POP , to parse intransitive and transitive sentences  . Informally , the conditions are: ( 1 / If the V is in t rans i t ive then the I and O must be empty  .   ( 2 ) If the V is transitive then the I must be empty  . We have implemented a large parser of Hindlwlth wide coverage of construction types including relative clauses  , interrogatives , passives , dative subjects , compound verbs and gapping which interact with word order variation  ( see Dey 1982 ,  1984) . 
Word order variation in Hindlis fairly restrictive  . Thus , in the sentences of (3 . 11) the main verb must precede the AUX .  (3 . 15 ) is unacceptable because it violates this restriction  .

Similarly , (3 . 16 ) violates the restrict lont hat the case elements must follow the noun  ( Verma 1970 )  .

As obvious frmn (3 . 15-16), all rules of tIindi are not'set . rules ' . Thus , the subject " NP ,  $ , cannot be expanded by (3 . 17a ); rat\] .   .   .   . w .   .   .   . th .   .   .   .   .   .  1 (3 . 17b) .

The parsing strategy suggested above for this grammar has an important consequence  . It does not recognize VP ( thab dominates V , O , I ) as a constituent . It advocates a'flat'structure for sentences as shown in  ( 3 . 1 . 8) . 
(3 . 18 ) S (   1 ovmo hanner aamkosev dlaa " Mohan gavet be apple to Ram  . " It should be noted that actual structural representations should be given with mort details  . Some parse trees given by the parser are presented below :  ( 3 . 19) ( p .   .   .   .   . ( inoh .   .   .   .   .   .   . aln k .   .   .   . dlaathaa ) )  ( S ( NP-subj ( NP ( DEW nil )   ( ADJ )   ( Nmohan ) )  ( K-aghe ) )  ( NP-ind ( NP ( DET nil )   ( ADJ )   ( N .   .   .   .   .   .   ) )  ( K-datko ) )  ( NPobj ( NP ( DET nil )   ( ADJ )   ( Nsev ) ) )   ( VX ( ADV )   ( Vdlaa ( AUX thaa ) ) ) ) t ( 3 . 20 )   ( parse ( diaathaase vraam komohanne ) )  ( S ( NP-sul , j ( NP ( DET nil )   ( ADJ )   ( imohan ) )  ( K-agne ) )  ( NP-ind ( NP ( DET nil )   ( hDJ )   ( iraam ) )  ( K-datko ) )  ( iP-obj ( i l ' ( DET nil )   ( ADJ )   ( Nsev ) ) )   ( VX ( ADV )   ( Vdiaa ( AUX thaa ) ) ) )t It is t~o be noted that though case words llke ne and ko often help to identify subjects  , objects etc . the parser must use semantic information in order to identify them in sentence smlch as the ones given in  ( 3 . 21-22) ( see Dey 1984) .

Concluding Remarks Processing word order variation with new techniques within the modified ID/LP framework seems to be revealing  . 
But , it is note on text " fl'eenn like other ID/LP based parsers  . 
Detailed comparison of II ) /LP based parsers is a subject of further research  .
