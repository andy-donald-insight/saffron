A central problem in speech synthesis with unre-stricted vocabulary is the automat ic derivation of correct pronunciation from the graphemic form of a text  . The software module GRAPHON was developed to perform this conversion for German and is currently being extended by a morphological analysis component  . This analysis is based on a morph lexicon and a sot of rule ~ and structural descript ions for German word-forms  . It provides each text input item with an ind ividual characterization such that the phonological ~ syntactic  , and prosodic components may operate upon it . This systematic approach tht~s serves to minimize the number of wrong transcriptions and at the same timelays the foundation for the generation of stress and intonation pat terns  , yielding more intelligible ~ natural- sounding  , and generally acceptable synthetic speech . 
1. INTRODUCTION
Many applications of computer speech requi reun re-stricted vocabulary  . In particular ~ voice output units of thi skind permit the linkage of the common tele -phone network to a central computer  , thus enabling access for a large public . " Karlchen " , the Frankfurt talking rail way time table , and other automatic infor-mation services are based on this principle  . 
If a written text serves as input to a speech syn-thesis system with unrestricted vocabulary  ( text-to-speech synthesis ) p the derivation of a correct and natural- sounding pronunciation and intonation must be provided for  . The software module GRAPHON ( GRAP Hemo-PHO Nome-conversion ) has boon developed to convert any given German text into its phonetic transcription  ( I . P . A . ) ~ enriched by some prosodic markers . 
The text-to-speech system is being implemented on an HP  9816 workstation system with a 68000 CPU and 768 k byte of RAM . At present a SSI 263 phone syn-the sizer serves as acoustical output unit  ; a simplified articulatory model used to control a refined digital vocal tract synthesizer is under development  . The software is written in PASCAL and operat ion of the whole system is expected to be a lmost real-time  .   ( For further implementational details cf .  \[1\] . ) While text - to - speech sys tems for the Eng l i sh lan - guage are fa i r l y advanced  , there is much room for development for German ~ peaking systems  . It is pos-sible only to a limited extent to profit from work in the field of Engli sh  . Obviouslyj German pronunciation rules di ffer from those of other languages  ;   however9 the mere replacement of a given grapheme-to- phoneme conversion rule by another is inadequate to meet the demands of the very dif ferent principles on which two writing- systems are founded  . Tills also applies to the structural levels of morphology and syntax  . 
2 . MOTIVATION FOR A MOR PHOIA ) GICAL COMPONENT The application of an Engli sh pronunciation rule is lexically determined  , that is to say , is restricted to a generally arbitrary subset of the lexicon  ( compare ~ for example , the values of ( eaY in the sets 4bread , head , thread . . . ~ and kneads bead , heat . ., ) . It is for this reason that many English- based systems include very extensive dict ionaries  , for example the pioneer-ing work of Allen \[2\] with a 12000 morpheme lexicon . 
On the other hand , German rules have in general a much wider scope of application  , which has led re-searchers working in the f ield of German to consider large lexical inventories unnecessary  . The inventories in e . g . SAMT \[3\] or SPRAUS-VS \[4\] are thus re-stricted to function words needed for the syntactic analysis  ( prepositions , pronouns , articles , etc . )  . 
Similarly , our earliest efforts in this area were based however pnumerous incorrect transcript ions at morphological boundaries and the f requent recurrence to ad hoc rules  ( of .  \[1\] ) made the lack of some sort of morphological in d icator apparent  . 
However more closely German spelling may ref lect pronunciation than is the case in English p difficulties arise in producing a correct pronunciation auto-matically if knowledge available to the human speaker  , such as the internal structure of a given word or its native as opposed to foreign orig in  , is not made use of . The following examples should suffice to demonstrate the relationship between morphology and the values of the written symbols : - One fundamental rule is that vocalic quantity is determined by the number of fol lowing consonants : the first rule given in the DUDEN Auss prache-wSrter buch  \[5\] states that < a ) is to be pronounced/a:/when followed by only one consonant grapheme before the stem boundary  , so that the inflectional form fast of the verb rasen  ( " rush " ) becomes/ra:st / ~ whereas the simplex noun Rast  ( " rest " ) becomes/fast / . 
-Consonant or vowel groups may be assigned d igraph or trigraph value only when they appear within morphological boundaries  ; compare for example the different values of < sch > in  15schen / f / ( " extinguish " ) und HiSschen/sq/ ( dim . of " pants ") , or of < ei > in Geier/ai / ( " vulture " ) and geirrt/ali / ( " erred " )   . 
-The first stem syllable in German ( native stock ) receives the primary word stress ja rule which implies this stem Js being identifiable  ; compare geben / ' ge:bn / ( " give " ) and Gebein/ga ' bain / ( " bones ' )   . 
Those phenomena playa role in the domain of der iv-ation and inflection ~ which has been dealt within several system ste  . g . SYNTEX\[6\] or REDE\[7\] ; these do contain lists of common prefixes and suffixes to permit affix-stripping ~ a l though they are pre-dominantly rule- based  . The same problems are found in the field of composition  ; their import is heightened by the very great f requency of this process in the German language  . Still , Riihl \[6\] proposes a decom-position algorithm which relies on distributional criteria and on lists of consonant clusters in initial authors too prefer to minimize the lexical component : " The attempt to incorporate this problem into a mainly rule-based system seemed to us to require a rather great and thus undesired step towards a kind of dict ionary approach "  ( \[9\] ~ p . 226) . 
It is however certainly possible to make a case for a morphological analysis containing a morph-lexicon of some depth  . The conversion program presented here makes extensive use of such an analysis component  ( see fig .  1 ) and thus in our opinion profits from the fol lowing advantages : inflection ~ derivation ~ and composition can be treated simultaneously  , more economically , and with a reduced number of incorrect segment at ions  ; this latter is achieved by specifying the respective environments of potential elements  ; -simple and efficient treatment of exceptions ~ for instance the pronunciation of foreign words  ; this and the preceding result in a reduced t ranscrip-tion error rate and in simplified and more trans-parent grapheme-to-phoneme conversion rules  ; correct placement of word-internal boundar iesj labelling of the constituents and the lexieally stored information concerning native vs  . foreign status favour accurate word stress assignment  ; the lexicon-based approach prepares the ground for word classification and extraction of certain syntactic constraints  , providing the input for an elementary sentence parser  .

Fig .   1: The role of the morphological component within GRAPHON  3  . SKET CHOF THE MOH PHOIX ) GICAL OO MPONENT 3 . 1 . Lexie all : nventory Morphological analysis in our system relies on a single lexicon ra the r than on separate lists of  , say , prefixes , stems , junctures etc . The entries in this lexicon are morphs and not morphemes in that stem variation  , i . e . processes such a sumlaut ( e . g . Apfel-~pfel " apple ") , ablaut ( lau?-lie ? " run " ) and e-deletion ( trocken-trockn-"dry " ) are not covered by rule but by storage of al lo morphs  . As we are not concerned with generation , this appears to be the most practical method  . Forms that are in some way irregular are then naturally provided with individual entries  , for example anomalous verb forms ( sein-bin-war-w~r- . . . " be " ) or forms of the definite article ( dot , die , das , dem ,   .   .   .  )  . We have chosen to set up the most basic forms wherever possible  , e . g . NAM-as opposed to NAME ( nominative singular )   , which permits an economical treatment of der ivation and inflection  . AE~a matter of fact , the overriding principle gow ~ rning the dec ision what exactly should constitute a nent ry is a pragmatic one : for example  , rather than taking sides on linguistic , historical , or psychological grounds in such controvers ial cases a sant wort-vs  . ant + worL -(" answer "), him beer-vs . 
him + beer -(" rasp berry ") , or verlie ~ vs . ver+lier- ( " lose " ) ~ we choose the solution favouring the ideal functioning ot ' the system as a whole  . 
3 . 1 . 1 . Structure of a Dictionary Entry Adict ionary entry consists of the lemma  , i . e . 
graphemic representation of the morph , on the one hand and an information-tree , serving to characterize its phonological , morphological and syntactic value on the o ther  . 
A number of practical conventions has been setup for the form of the lemma : a given morph is repre-sented by a maximum often lower- case letters  ; the diacritic sign " ( umlaut ) is made use of ( cf . other systems which decompose the vowels in question as < ae  )  , <oe> , < u e >); likewise , the sign < D > is not replaced by < ss > ei the rin the input text or in the lexicon  . An orthographic ~ ule of German states that < ss > becomes </\]> before a consonant or a word- boundary  , so that the latter sign's usual function as an indicator of vowel length is neutral i zed in these positions  ( compare Flfiaae " rivers " vs . F/,De " feet " with FluI3(/tr /) vs . FuB(/u :/)); this " defect " ( cf . \[10\]) p . 108 ) can be go tround by maintaining the oppos it i on between < s s > and < ~> in the lemma  . 
The information-tree contains classificatory data pertaining to the morph itself and to those it may immediately select  ; they concern morphological status ( lexical stem-particle-derivational morph inflectional morph-juncture -  . .  . ) , native or foreign status , and combinatorial restrictions . In addition , the lexicon allows the introduction of info rmation for the assignment to parts of speech and  , wherever neces-sary , indications as to exceptional pronunciat ionor stress pattern  . 
3 . 1 . 2 . Extent of the Lexical Inventory At present the lexical inventory comprises some  2000 entries , the choice of which was based on Ortman n\[11\] , itself compiled from four frequency l is ts  . As for the contents of the entries , we relied on Augst\[12\] , Mater\[13\] , and Wahrig\[14\] . For the ongoing testing , revie ~ ion ~ and supplementing of this pr imary list we depend on the frequency list in Meier  \[15\] as well as on sample texts from various random sources  . In as much as affixes , particles , and junctures ( at least native ones ) constitute closed classes , they should be represented exhaustively in the inventory  . This is unfortunately not the case as soon as one turns to foreign elements  , to whose number are always being added new candidates  . 
Moreover , it is very difficult if not impossible to establish general principles accord ing to which foreign suffixes in particu lar may be isolated and the dividing line found between stem and suffix  . 
Proper nouns are represented only to a very l imited extent  ; their range should be adapted to the require -ments of the task at hand  . In fact , the compilation of the inventory has been carr ied out with the aims of expandability and maximum flexibility  . 
Itts of course not to be expected that the lexicon would ever cover the entire vocabulary of a native speaker  , nor is that our intention ; consequently , we foreseea " jokerraorph " which can stand for any stem that may happen to occur  . This is made possible a number of structura l principles : for example  , every stem must contain a vowel and the varie ty of consonant clusters in initial  , medial , and final position is restricted ( of .  \[8\]) . An oven more general canonical description can be expleited in the case of foreigne lements  . Such a device has not yet been implemented . 
For the time being ,   64 k byte have been reserved to accomodate the loxieal inventory  . Note that all loxical data as described above are coded so as to achieve maximum storage eff iciency  . 
3.2. Word Parser
The segmentation of a given ( complex ) word is carried cut automatically in aser ies of steps  ; the process is bound from the very first of these to the dictionary  , as stated above . Just as the human speaker seeks familiar uni ts in his identification of a werd  , the automatic analysis considers for fur the rattention only those segment ~ which cor respond to forms available in the lexicon  , such that the segments are contiguous and no le tters are left unaccounted for  . Thus a segmentation such as mein+un+g for Meinung  ( " opinion " ) could not be produced in the first place , as + g + has no representation in the lexicon . The number of petentlal analyses is further reduced by the fact that no boundaries are searched for in a word corresponding identica lly to a single unit in the lexicon  , for example der would not be analyzed as d + or ord + o + r  . For reasons of run-time efficiency , a strategy is used which " prefers " the longest segments  , starting from the beginning of a given word  ; thus deck+on ( " cover " ) would be the first segmentation proposed be for ed+eck+on  . The usefulness of this principle can be seen from an example like E intritt  ( " entrance " )   , where the order of segmentations would be : s in + tritt  , sin+t+rift , ei+n+tritt , ei+n+t+flit , e + in + tritt , e + in + t + rift , e + i + n + tritt , e+i+n+t+rift . The first decision proposed by the parser can be proved to be the correct one in the overwhelming majority of cases  , which allows us to delay requiring a second proposal until the first has been rejected on structural grounds in the fol lo-wing step of the analysis procedure  . 

In this second step the proposed segmentations are examined as to their conformity to the pr inciples of German morphological struc ture  . The following struc-tural formula descr ibes every German word  , whether of native or foreignerigin :\[ P : + S+Dso+J\]:where by : llb  .   .

J .   .   . juncture morph(e . g . + eseinBm~desbEdm " national railway " ) The segmentation is assigned a structural description by matching the combinatorial features of each unit with the morph status information of its neighbour as given in the respective lexicon entries  . A morph may be specified according to the fo llowing properties and in turn select cer tain values for these properties in its ne igh bour : - native or foreign status  , -lexical functionality this property is manifested by the capacity to receive in f lection  )   , -- morphological status ( as in the above structure definition with additional detailed classification  )   , and - lexical class , i . e . part of speech as reflected in the inflect i on a lending  . 
Specification of these properties is opt ional  ; however ~ the more information provided , the more restrictions with respect to the general structure formula are achieved  , so that the number of potential labellings is reduced and the labellings themselves bear more information  . Thus , it is possible to previde at least apart i altreatment for words whose stems are not roD-resented in the  2000 entry lexicon . 
Should no match be obtained in this stop , the process is repeated with a new segmentation until compatible sets of features are found  .

Fig .   2 presents examples of the resulting segmen-ta tions and labellings  . We see that the first segmentation of Antei l  ( " portion " ) is rejected , as in this case the stem would be preceded by a suffix  ( + ant + being a longer segment than + an + , it has received " priority " up to this point  )   . In the second segmentation , + an + is correctly recognized as a non-lex icalE~tem  , upon which a lexical stem may follow . It is not possible to specify the lexical c lass selected by + an +  , as it combines with all parts of speech ; and as + toil+can function as a noun or a verb stem  , there result two potential labellings . The ambiguity cannot be resolved at this s tage  . 
The following example is somewhat more compl icated  . 
Crucial here is the boundary between the two s tems of the compound Erwerbst ~ tiKen  ( " employees " ) : the phonological consequences of an error ( /It/instead of/st / ) are quite serious . After the correct seg-mentation has final lybeen found  , three possible interpretations are proposed  . Note that + on + can serve as a participle morph  ( Z )  , so that the word would syntactically funct ion as an adjective  . 
The third step consists of additional checks and finer specifications in order to isolate the correct structure and part -of-speech assignment for the whole word  . For instance , if a suffix has been identified as a poss ible past participle morph  , this could be verified by searching for a corresponding prefix  ( of . to il+t " shares " vs . ge+tell+t " shared ") . Another check could exploit certain re-st rictions on the sequence of lexical and non- lexical stems in a complex word  , , Such tes ts have not as yet been implemented . 
The lexical class of a German word is , generally speaking , determined by its last element , so that the classification algorithm makes use of the results of the matching process at the end of the word  . Some derivational morphs , e . g . + un ~' h + keit + , + ie ch + , permit unambiguous classification . Unfortunately the same cannot be said of inf lection alendings in particular and many other elements as well  , taken alone . By ex-ploiting the combinatorial info rmation  , however , many ambiguities are eliminated ; moreover , capitalization can be treated as a sign a l for the lexical class noun  . 
Each text unit is now provided with a struc tural specification i ~ uch that the phono logical  , syntactic and prosodic component ~ may operate on it  . Fig .   3 shows segmentations and lexical class as s ignment for a sample sentence  ; based on these , the phonological component already in place determines the correct pronunciation and generates the I  .

-A relatively limited number of lexical entr ies is capable of handling a considerable quantity of running text  . The morphological information stored in each entry has proved to be relevant and in general sufficient for correct segmentation  . 
However , in order to increase accuracy in deter-mining lexical class  , as required by the syntactic analysis , it would be advantageous to expand the number of categories represented in the lexicon entries  . As it was not clear before the present tests exactly which additional classification would be useful  , we chose to start from a minimum and provide for easy future expansion  . For example , the experiments confirm our assumption that it would be desirable to specify the potential junctures for a given stem and to differentiate several inflectional paradigms within a lexical class  , in particular strong and weak verbs . These data would have resolved the ambiguities encountered for the sample words in Fig  .  2 . 
- As the aims of our system do not include any attempt to incorporate semantics and as more over there is no feedback from the syntactic component planned  , a unique structural specification cannot be expected in the case of ambiguities requiring reference to these structural levels  . Since such ambiguities do not necessarily lead to incorrect grammatical specification and only rarely to incorrect pronunciation  , this is only a relative limitation . 
Correctness of the phonemic transcription cer tainly accounts for a great part of the quali ty and accepta-bility of a text-to-speech system  . Nevertheless it is often claimed e . g .  \[6\] ) that synthetic speech should be evaluated along further dimensions  , such as inte\[-One goal Of the approach presented here is to lay the ground for the incorporation of rules for the assignment and realization of stress and intonation patterns not only on the word but also on the sentence level  . Thus the basic phonetic transcription will be extended and modified so as to give a represen -tation closer to natural speech  .
