After the first work on machine-readable dictionaries  ( MRDs ) in the seventies , and with the recent development of the concept of a lexical database  ( LI ) B ) in which interaction , flexibility and multidim ; ensionality can be achieved , but everything must be explicitly stated in advance  , a new possibility which is no we merging is that of a procedmal exploitation of the full range of semantic in ! brmation implicitly contained in MRI  ) s . The dictionary is considered in this framework as a prima ~' y source of basic general knowledge  . In the paper we describe a project to develop a system which has word sense acquisition fi'om information contained in computerize dictionaries and knowledge organization as its main objectives  . The approach consists in a discovery procedure technique operating on natural anguage delinitions  , which is recursively applied and relined . We start \[ i ' om freetext definitions , in natural language linear form , analyzing and converting them into infbrmationally equivalent structured forms  . This new approach , which aims at reorganizing ti ' ee text into elaborately structured information  , could be called the Lcxical Knowledge Base(I . KB ) approach . 
1. Baekgromld
For acmls idcrable period in theoretical and computational linguistics  , there was a predominant lack of interest in lexical problems  , which were regarded as being of minor importance with respect o " core " issues concerning linguistic phenomena  , mainly of a syntactic nature , l ) uring the last few years , howev cr , this trend has been a hnost reversed . The role of the lexicon in both linguistic thcories and computational applications is now being greatly revalued and one aspect on which a number of research groups are now focussing their attention is the possibility of reusing the large quantity of data contained in a lrcady existing machine-readable lcxical sources  , mainly dictionaries prepared for photocomposition  , as a shortcut in the construction of extensive NL l'-oriented lexicons  . 
This position was formulated very clearly in a number of papers presented at a recent workshop organized in Grosse to  ( Italy ) and sponsored by the European Community ( see Walker , Zampolli , Calzolari , furthcoming ) , and can be found in these tel " recommendations which was one of " the results of this workshop  ( Zampolli 1987 , pp . 332-335) . 
After the first work on machine-readable diction a , ' ies(MRI ) s ) in the seventies ( see Olney 1972 , Sherman 1974) , and with the recent development o I ~ the concept of ' a lexical database  ( l . l ) B ) in which interaction , flexibility and multidiinensionality can be achieved  , but everything must be explicitly stated in advance  ( see e . g . Amsler 1980 , Byrd 1983 , Calzolari 1982 , Michiels 1980) , a new possibility which is no we merging is that o1" a procedural exploitation of the lull range of semantic intbrmation implicitly contained in MRI  ) s ( see Wilks 1987 , Binot 1987 , Alshawif orthcoming , Calzolari forthcoming ) . 
\[ he dictionary is now considered as a prilnary source not only of lcxical knowledge but also of basic general knowledge  ( ranging over the entire " world " )  , and some of tim dictionary systems which are being developed have knowled ~  , e acquisition and knowledge organization as their principal objectives  ( see also l . en atal/d\[:eigenbaum 1987) . In this paper we describe at project which we are now conducting on the acquisition of semantic inlbrmation ti'om computerized dictionaries  . 
2 . I ) at a and estal ) lished methods fiw hierarchic'd semantic classifying The data we use in our research include the lexical information contained in the Italian Machine I  ) ictionary ( I ) MI )  , which is a h'eady structured as a LI ) B and is n rainly based on the Zingarelli Italian dictionary  ( 1970 )  ; the DMl-l ) B has different types o\[" linguistic in I ormation already accessible online  . A morphological module generates and analy , ' es the intlected word forms : approximately I million fiom  120  , 000 lemmas , l . cnm/as , wordforms , deriwitiv cs/suflixes , POS , usage codes , and specialized terminology codes , can be used its direct access search keys through which the user can query the database dictionary  . On the semantic side , synonyms , hyponyms , and hypcrnyms constitute already implemented access paths covering all of the approximately  200  , 000 definitions contained in the dictionary . Examples of possible queries arc the l bllowing : give me all the nouns defined as names of vehicles  , of sounds , of games , all the verbs defined by a particular genus term , for example ' MUOVE II . E ' ( to move ), ' TAGLIARI . :'( to cut ), etc . The procedures used to find
B 7 hypernyms in definitions and to create taxonomies are similar to those used by other groups  ( see Chodorow 1985 , Calzolari 1983 , Amslcr 1981) . 
We have now begun work on restructuring another dictionary available in MRF  , the Garzanti Italian dictionary (1984) . A parser has been implemented which , on the basis of the type setting codes for photocomposition  , identifies the rough structure of each lexical entry  . Fig .   1 displays the output of a parsed entry of the Garzanti dictionary  . Fig .   2 represents the provisional model for a monolingual lexical entry as we have defined it so far  . Fig .   3 gives the projection of the first interpretation of the type setting codes into this model  ; other kinds of information will be added afterwards  ( for example , that obtained by the inductive procedures described in the paper  )  .

The merging of part of the data of tile DMI and the Garzanti dictionary into a single LI  ) B has already been completed , e . g . 
for lemmas , POSs , usage codes , etc . We now have to tackle the problcm of reorganizing the semantic data  ( dc finitions and examples )  . It creour strategy is to design a new procedural system which is ablctogradually " learn " and acquire semantic infornlation from dictionary definitions  , going well bcy on dth cISA hierarchies constructed so far  , in order to attemp to also captur c what is prescnt in the " diff crcntia " part of the definition  . 
This can be achieved with some success given the particular nature of lexicographic definitions  , with : a ) a generic ( and pe ' rhaps over simplistic ) description of the " world " ; b ) a rather lcxically and syntactically constrained and a somewhat regular natural anguage tcxt  ( Calzolari 1984 , Wilks 1987) . 
After having mapp cd the codcs for photo composition it olinguistically relevant codes  , all the preliminarily parsed data of the Garzanti have been organized on a PC in the form of a Textual Database  ( DB rl ' )  , a fuEl-text Information Retrieval ( IR ) system in which all occurrences of any wordform or lermna can be directly accessed  ( Picchi 1983 )  . The I ) BT has been found to be a very powerful tool in evidencing lexical units and particular syntagms which can then be exploited in our " pattern -matching " procedure  . With the text in DBT form it is possible to search occurrences of single word forms in definitions and examples  , lemmas , codes of various types ( POS , specialized languages , usage labels , etc . ) , and also cooccurrences of any of these items throughout he entire dictionary  . In addition , structures composed of combinations of the above elements connected by the logical operators " and " and " or " to any degree of complexity can also be searched  . The results of such queries are returned together with the pertinent dictionary entries  . 
Obviously frequencies can also be obtained . All this information can be retrieved with Fast interactive access  . 
We have therefore already implemented two types of organization for dictionary data :  1  ) DB-type organization with the DM1 ( we have not used a standard DBMS , but an adhoc designed relational 1) B system ) ;  2 ) a fulltext IR system for the Garzanti dictionary . 
Although both types of organization have proved to be very powerful tools for different scopes  , attile same time each presents certain drawbacks and difficulties  , due to the particular nature of dictionary data which in neither case has it been possible to fully exploit  . Dictionary data is in fact of a very particular nature  , consisting of a combination of freetext in a highly organized structure  . The DB approach copes well with the second characteristic  , while the \[ R approach is successful in handling freetext  . tlowever neither is capable of fully exploiting the two features in combination  . A new method must been visaged , capable of reorganizing freetext into elaborately structured information : this could be called the Lexical Knowledge Base  ( LKB ) approach , and is the aim of the project described here . 
3 . Techniques fi ~ r word sense acquisition D is cow : ry procedure techniques prove to be useful in extracting semantic information from definition texts  . In general , our approach consists in starting from fi'ee-t cxt definitions  , in natural languag clinear form , analyzing and converting them into inlormationally equivalent structured tbrms  . The preliminary step of the work consisted in applying the morphological analyzer to the definitions  ; tim result of this process t brone definition appears in Fig  .  4 . A program designed for homograph disambignation was then run on the otput produced by this morphological processor  . The disambiguator consists partly in rules generally valid for Italian  , based on the immediate rate right and left context , and partly in adhoc rules written for the particular syntax used in lexicographic definitions  . Fig .   5 shows the result of applying this disambiguation procedure to all the homographs shown in the preceding example  . We then had to implement a set of discovery procedures acting on dictionary definitions  .

This is , therefore , ou . rapproach . We begin with a system which has simple and general pnrpose pattern-matching capabilities  , designing it as an incremental system . To cope with the fact that there are ~ ariations in the way the same conceptual category or the same relation is linguistically  ( lcxically aider syntactically ) rendered in natural language definitions , each stt cll category or relation is associated with a list of specilic dlcxical units and or syntactict'caturcs which give the variant Ibrms  . The search is then driven by these lists of patterns to handle the grammaticalnd lexical variations  . 
The " patt cn > nmt ching " strategy has bccn obviously integrated with the Italian morphological analyzer to handle inflectional variation  . The patterns may contain either l . abcls , or Lemmas , or Word-tbrms .

NILOi 3.1 is the subje(St matter of the science.
The results of a first run through the whole dictionary using an initial set of patterns can afterwards be recursively revised when new data are acquired  . Our practical global research strategy is to develop a system which at the beginning has only a generalized expertise  . This system obviously breaks down at many points on its first rtm  ; we can then evaluate all these to overcome specilic difficulties  . In this way , ncw capabilities can be added incrementally to the system so that gradually it is able to cope with increasingly difficult data  . Thus wc systematically add new " knowledge " to the system  , prompted each time by a failure to cope with the given data  . It seems to us that this is a practical research strategy For cliciting and modelling vague and fuzzy knowledge  . 
liven though the methodological approach has been deliberately simplified at the beginning  ( in order to introduce problems gradually , a few at a time ) , the dimensions of the data have not bccn limited in any way  . 
4. The knowledge organization.
Although the body of knowledge with which we are dealing is at least partly based on intuition  , on vague and not even coherent data ( as lexicographic definitions often are )  , and on inductive empirical strategies , we must attempto model the knowledge as the system acquires it  . The formalism for the representation fword senses i as follows  . 
Each element is defined as a Function characterized by a Type and Arguments  . The Type qualifies the function . The main types include : tly pernym , Relation , Qualifier , etc . 
Examples of the Type . Relation are : USED , PRODU('I~D , IN-TIIIM : OP , M , SI'IJI)Y , LACK , etc . The typelly pernym can be instantiated by : ! lyperriym proper  , PART , SliT , etc . 
Arguments may be either Terms , or Terms plus Function , or Functions . A Term can be a Label , a Word , or a combination of these with the logical operators ' and/or '  . A Word can be either a Wordform , or a Lemma plus Grammatical Information ( e . g . INpl means plural Noun ) . 
The following definitions :
Battcrio , s . m . , microrganismo vcgetale unicellularc priw ) diclor of illa . 
Batteriologia , s . f . , parte dellamic robiolo Nache studiai battcri . 
are now represented as:
Batterio--def-->f(T . ttYP , INI microrganismo , f(T . QUAL , lAlvegetale,\]AlunicelMare ), f(-I' . REL-I . ,XCK , \[N\[clorofilla )) Baltcliolo ~ a--def-->f(T . IIYI'-PART , f(T . REL-SPEC , lNI microbiologia ), f(T . I ~, I-I,-STUD , INpl banerio)) . 
As the metalanguage and the rules are declared separately from the pattern-matching parser  , the system is incremental , flexible , portable ( it can be used with other languages or other dictionaries  )  , and testable . In fact , the system has been designed so that it is easy to test alternative strategies or sets of rules or constraints  . 
This kind of organization will allow us to draw inferences  , using part of the formal structure associated to an entry and inserting it in other structures in which that entry appears as an Argument  . For example , ' microbiologia ' present in tile second definition above is dclined in its turn as ' parled ellabiologia the studiai microrganismi  . . . ', translated as ( T . IIYI'-PAIUI',f(T . Rlil . .SI'IiC , IN\[I ~ iologia)) , and ' biologia ' which is " scienza chestudiai fenomeni dellavita  . . . ' is finally defined as T . 1 IYP-SCII !

This analysis o\["the litst resuhs will lead to an improven ~ ent of the system  , adding other patterns or other surface realizations of already existing patterns to the lirst simple list of t  ) atterns , and also imposing constraints on given hypernyms or on given relations  . I'heretbre , after the first stage , the system consists of patterns augmented with conditioning rules which will then drive subsequent runnings of tile procedure  ( \[ br those cases which are lexically or grammatically conditioned  )  . In this way , the system can be gradually retined . The analysis procedure is envisaged as a series of cycles which lind relevant cooccurrenccs of categories and relations that can then be set as conditioning rules to further guide successive searches  . Art interactive phase is also foreseen so that , when necessary , definitions can be modified \[ branormalization i accordance to acceptable analysistructures  . 
From succes ! ive passes through the data , applying different and increasingly < efined sets of patterns and rules  , the procedure huilds up , as completely as possible with this methodology , a formal description of the structure of the lexical definitions  . 
At the end , from a comparison of the different formalized stuctures generated  , we will be able to associate structures which differ for only one element  ( a conceptual category or relation )  . In this way , we can construct something like " minimal pairs " of sense-definitions  , which only differ in one conceptual or relational feature  . It can be reasonably supposed that this teature is related or realizes one of the differences between these words  . It will also be possible to build hierarchies not only for hypcrnyms  , but also , and more interestingly , for complex conceptual structures considered as a whole  .
