One of the major tasks of the quantitative semantic analysis is to disclose complex relations of sememes in communication  , i . e . on the basis of their associations in the frame of syntactic structures  . With the aid of computer it is possible to prepare a corpus of language material giving the possibility to quantify/I  . /semantics of syntactic functions ,/2 . /lexical meanings , /3 . /meanings of morphological categories , esp . those of parts of speech , and to create a new type of semantic frequency dictionary  . 
The assistance of computer in present-day quantitative linguistic studies makes possible to quantify not only language events  , but also their relations , not only their static features , but also the dynamic tendencies of language . This refers , in the first place , to the phenomena of lexicon where the application of quantitative methods as well as the modern computer processing have been of a certain tradition  ; but the computer-aided research is applied on other language levels  , too , e . g . in graphemics , pho-nemics , morphemics , and can be performed also in morphology and syntax  . Thus , the contribution of L . Uhli Fov & a . collaborators , workers of the Dept . of Mathematical Linguistics and Phonetics of the Czech Language Institute  , informed about the computer-aided quantification of patterns of simple  , compound , and complex sentences and about ' their close relationship to the morphological #rid lexical Levels  . 
The results achieved in quantitative an a lysis stimulate us to Lake a further step  , i . e . to quantify the semantic aspects of language phenomena  . In this stage of analysis the computer is an indispensable instrument of research  . 
Let us remember in this place the thirties and fifties of this century when the firs t semantic frequency dictionaries of English were-manually-compiled\[I\]  ,  \ [2\]  . They were isolated achievements combining quanti tative and qualitative approaches to obtain the frequency of individual lexical meanings  . 
In the Dept . of Mathematical Linguistics and Phonetics , we dispose with a statistical corpus of texts processed by computer the units of which / words/have been encoded in context with regard to syntax  , morphology and lexicon ; the corpus provides an adequate basis for the quantification of the socalled context meaning  , i . e . 
meaning in a certain context\[3~.
As it is known , a discourse is determined by external and internal linguistic conditions  , in other words , it is a function of lingu-istic and extra linguistic variables  . The complex relations between objects and other events of reality are reflected in language by syntagmatic and paradigmatic relations  ; to disclose their mutual conditioning is one of the major aims of the semantic analysis  . 
The lexicon introducing these memes within their proper systems is not capable to cope with the i r complex relations in the communica-tion  , and , thus , it is necessary to examine the linking of sememes in the frame of syntactic structure  . This is a task which cannot be done without an assistance ~ f computer  , especially when the re-lations are to be quant ified  . And , at the same time , this is a task which ought to be performed by the quantitative linguistics as a first step to the quantification of meaning which is today at the centre of interest in linguist ics  , logic and other sciences . 
A prerequisite for obtaining good results in the semantic research is a computationally processed corpus of linguistic units/sentence tokens/in which we may quantify :  /1   . /semantics of syntactic functions ,/2 . /lexical meanings by means of which the semantics of sentence elements are expressed  ,  /3  . /meanings of morphological categories , especially those of parts of speech , when they prove to be of importance for semantics in points  /1   . / and /2 .  /  . 
On this subject we add a few remarks . Topoint/1 . /: It is well QUANTIFICATION OF MEANING AND THE COMPUTER  379 known that in spite of a considerable progress in sentence semantics in these last years  ~4\]  ,  \[5\] , there is a number of questions remaining unsolved or open  . Nevertheless , we are able to quantify semantics on the sentence level applying the principles of L  . Tes-nitre\[6\] . The approach consists in searching for semantic components corresponding to sentence members in different syntactic functions  . This is certainly no easy task , but is possible under the condition that we dispose with a perfectly performed syntactic analysis of whole sentences/simple  , compound , and complex / and larger samples of running texts  , as is the sampling used in the Depto of Mathematical Linguistics for the mentioned corpus of texts  . 
This sort of underlying language material allows us to study the semantics of language units even larger than a sentence-this  , however , being a prospect for a future work . 
Remarks to point/2 . /: The study of lexical meanings fixed ~ n explanatory dictionaries shows some interesting aspects  , too . The analysis based on their distribution in text and in relation to the respective semantics of syntactic functions gives a new picture of the frequency distribution of different context meanings associated with a word  , and , in some cases , even corrects their position with regard to morphological categories  . 
Remarks to point /3 . /: Each part of speech , of course , " behaves " in a different way as far as the semantics of syntactic functions and the lexical meanings are concerned  ; sometimes , the meaning can be significantly influenced also by morphological categories  . 
E . g . the animate and inanimate genders of masculines in Czech concern not only the semantics of the analyzed word  , but also its " environment " . So for example , the animateness of subject/e . g . 
agent /, or object/e . g . afficient / , is reflected in the verb/predicate/and also is connected with certain lexical meanings  ; similarly , the verb categories/e . g . mood and tense/often influence the use of lexical meanings as well as the constitution of new mea-nings  . 
These assertions will be now exemplified on two fundamental parts of speech  , the verb and the noun , which in the quantitative semantic analysis manifest some specific features referring to their part-of-speech properties and syntactic functions  .

E . g . the Czech verb in the predicative position represents together with its actants the semantic nucleus of sentence  . The actants are formally expressed by the subject  , object and/or adverbials as free complements . After the determination of meanings corresponding to the syntactic functions of verb as a further step we ascertain which of the lexical meanings functions most frequently as predicate  . The semantics of predicate may be also ingluenced by the part-of-speech appurtenance of actants assigned to syntactic functions  . 
assigned . It certainly makes a difference when a subject is expressed by a noun or a pronoun  , or when it is not expressed at all . 
There are other important aspects , too , e . g . whether the function of subject/e . g . agent/is expressed by an animate or an inanimate noun  , whether it is a human being , animal or thing , whether the word stands in the singular or the plurals whether it is plurale tantum etc  . In the relation of object to predicate we must take into account the lexical meaning of object and its morphological categories  , especially case . 
Between the verb , subject and object there exists a relation of semantic congruence  , i . e . a classificatory agreement of noun and verb / i  . e . of the predicate and its actants / . E . g . water , wine flows . _ . ,__~_~_# not so the table , the earth ~ we chase the d~not ~ . 
This principle is rather close to the intention of verb in the sense of E  . Pauliny\[7\] . 
With the noun in Czech we quantify the semantics corresponding especially to subject  , object , attribute and adverbial . Compared to the previous remarks on the semantic quantification of verb we have to do for the most part with an inverse relation  ; as a point of departure we take now the noun in one of its syntactic functions/with different meanings/and procede to the verb syntactical ly functioning as a predicate  . Further steps of analysis are practically the same as with the verb  , i . e . the determination of a corresponding lexical meaning of the given noun  , of its morphological categories and/or syntactic functions of its =' environment  . " With the , adverbial the attention is paid especially to whether it is obliga-tory or optional  . \[5\] . 
The semantic analysis of the remaining parts of speech in sentence  , e . g . formal words/grammar words / , such as prepositions and conjunc-tions shave some aspects common with verbs or nouns and  , in addition , QUANTIFICATION OF MEANING AND THE COMPUTER 381 some special features connected with their status  . In any case , the quantification of their semantics in the manner explained shows the functioning of wobds in text in a new light  . 
The quantitative Linguistics can fulfill the task presented with the aid of computer which creates optimum conditions for the appli- cation of quantitative methods in semantics  . Within the quantita-tive microanalysisQfindiv idual words in text/in context/aimed at an identification of context meaning it is possible to obtain new facts concerning the theory of semantics in general and the quanti tative semantics in special ~ the application of results may lead to a new type of semantic frequency dictionary  . And this is at present , under my leadership , the principal task of the Dept . 
of Mathematical Linguistics and Phonetics , in the Czech Language
Institute.
