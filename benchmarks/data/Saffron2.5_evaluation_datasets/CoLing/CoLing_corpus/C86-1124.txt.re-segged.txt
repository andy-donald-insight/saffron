FOR MALS PECIFICATION OF NATUR ALLANG UAGE SYNTAX

The two-level grammar is investigated as a notation forgiving formal 
specification of the context-frec and context -sensitive aspects of n  , ~tural
language syntax . In this paper , a large class of English declarative sentences , including post-noun-modificatlon by relative clauses  , is formalized using a two-level grammar . The principal advantages of two-level grammar are  :   1  ) it is very e ~ sy to understand and may be used to give a formal description using a structured form of natural anguage  ;  2 ) it is formal with many wellknown mathematical properties  ; and 3 ) it is directly implementable by interpretation . The significance of the latter fact is that once we have written a two-level grammar for natural language syntax  , we can derive a parser automatically without writing any additional specialized computer programs  . Because of the ease with which two-levcl grammars may express logic and their Turing computability we expect that they will also b cvery snitable for future extensions to semantics and knowledge representation  . 
1. INTRODUCTION
Formal specifications of natural language syntax should serve as a standard definition for the syntax of the subject language  . The specification must be complete , concise , consistent , precise , unambiguous , understandable , and useful to language scholars , users , and implcment ors who wish to develop a parser for the tanguag c to run on a computer  . 
Furthermore the specification should be mathematically rigorous to the degree that an implementation of the language can be automatically derived from the specification  10\]  . Unfortunately many of these aims arc difficult to accomplish primarily because of the dynanric and informal nature of natural language  . Formal specification is still a worthy goal to the degree allowed by present knowledge about natm ' a language and iuthispaper we propose a mct a language for specifying both syntax and semantics of natural anguage that has potential for satisfying these goals  . 
Them cta language we propose is the two-levd grammar  \[16   ( also called W-grammars and tlgs )  . Two-level grammars have been used extensively for specifying the syntax and semantics of programming languages  \[2\] but their use in specifying natural anguage was first introduced by the authors  \[7  ,  8 ,  9\] . 
Existing formal specification mcthods for natural language syntax take many forms  . Of these , some of the more common are augmented transition network grammars  \[181  , transformational grammars\[1\] , and generalized phrase-structure grammars \[5\] . These methods and others arc also surveyed in \[17\]  . The degree to which any formal specification method satisfies the above stated goals is sometimes difficult to evaluate and relies on subjectivity  . The authors do not intend to evaluate these existing methods with respect other equirements of formal specification languages but will instead concentrate on why two-level grammars satisfy the necessary goals in a mathematically rigorous but readable and easy to understand way  . In this paper , the two-level grammar mcta language will be used to define a large classification of English declarative sentences  , extending work described in \[8\] and\[9\] . We will emphasize the method of using two-level grammars for this purpose and the advantages gained rather than any particular characteristics of the given grammar  . 
2. TWO-LEVEL GRAM MARS
A two-level grammar consists of two sel ) a ratc grammars , them staproductlon rule ~ ( metarules ) and the hyperrules . The metarules are generally contextfree rules which take the form : METANOTION : :  hypcrnotion-1  ; hypcrnotlon-2 ;   . . . ; hypernotion-n . 
where METANOTION is tile lefthand side " nonterminal " symbol of the production and  hypernotion-1  , hypernotlon-2 ,   . . . hypcrnotion-n are then alternatives of the production right hand side  . Each hypcrnotion consists of protonotions ( terminal symbols ) and other metanotions . In the case of English , the terminal symbols of the recta-grammar e English words  . 
The recta-grammar itself is used to definc the contextfree~spccts of 
English . Example metarules arc:
SENTENCE :: DETERMINERNOUN VERB.
DETER MINER : : a ; an ; tile ; these ; those ; this ; that .

The hypcr rules are of the form hypcrnot\]on ; hyperalter n-1 ; hyper~ltern-2 ;   . . . ; hyperalter n-n . 
Tile hyperalternatives separated by semicolons arc distinct production alternatives  . Each of these hyperalt crnatives may be divided into a sequence of hypernotions separated by commas  . In a two-level grammar derivation tree , there will be one br : mch for each clement in the sequeuc c  . 
A two-level grammar with either hyperrnles having more than one hyperalt crnative or two distinct hypcr rules having the same hypcrnotion on the production lefthand side is nondetcr ministic  . \[f cachh Yl ) cr rule has only one hyperalter native and all hypcrnotions in production lefthand sides are distinct from mm another then the tlg is dc termin is l  ; ic . 
A hypcr rule is actually a production rule " pattern " since each hyperrule can possibly represent an infinite number of production rules in a contextfree grammar  . This is because a choccurrence of a metanotion in the hyp cr rulc represents all sequences of protonotions that can be derivcd from that metanotion  . That is , a hyperrule may be viewed as a set of production rules  ( called strict production rules ) in which all metanotions are replaced by the protonotions they derive  . The only restriction here is that if the rear c more than one occurrcnce of a single rnetanotion  , then each is replaced by the same protonotion sequence in deriving the strict production rules  . This is called conMstent substitution . For example , in the byperrulc where WORD is WOR\]): true . 
both occurrences of the metanotion WORD repr~ent the same protonotion  . The set of allowable protonotions in this rule is defined by the metarulcs for WORD  . If these metarules define an infinite number of possible protonotions  , then tile above hyperrule also represents an in finite uumb cr of strict i  ) roduction rules . \[ tistiffs featurc of two-level grammars that allow tbcm to define context-sensitive and recursiv clye numcrable languages  \[12\]  . 
If consistent substitution is not required ( or desired ) for metanotions with the same root metarul cs ( and nanm )  , then these metanotions may be distinguished by subscripts  . For example , where SENTENCE1 and SENTENCE2 are correct ; where SENTENCE1 is corre , ct , where SENTENCE2 is correct . 
In this hypcrrule , SENT : ENOE1 and SENTENCE ~ . are defined by the same metarul cs ( and rootmct a notion SENTENCE but need not have the same instantiations  . 
Some hypcr rules called predicates act as conditions which must be satisfied for the derivation to be : ~ uccessful  . A predicate begins with the word where or coadition and the terminal derivation of the hyperrule is the empty string if the condition is satisfied and will derive a " blind alley "  ( i . e . not derive any terminal string ) if the condition is not satisfied . Intire two-level grammar of English presented in this paper  , all hyperrules arc predicates and serve to perform context checks such as subject verb agreement  , object ~ vcrb agreement , and any additional required context cheeks which cannot be conveniently specified by a eontext -frcegrammar  ( i . e . tilemct a rules ) . 
3. METARULESFORENGLISH
Tile metarulcs of the two-level grammar for English define tire contextfree a ~ p ccts of English synt*Lx  . Some lexical items from English cannot be easily defined in a for in alway  ( i . e . using contextfree rules ) . These include tile nouns , verbs , adjectives , proper names , and titles , given names and surnames for people which arc lcxical categories containing a large number of elements  . The formal specification of these categories would be production rules of tlm form : NOUN : : aard vark labacus  ;   . . . ; zucchln L
VERB::abandon ; abate ; ...; zoom.
ADJECTIVE : : abdominal ; abhor renti..4 znhcd.
PROPER_NAME : : A berdeen ; A bilenc ; ...; Zambia.
TITLE : : Admiral ; Archblslmp; . . . ; Warrant Officer . 
For simplicity we choose to omit more formal specifications of the above categories  . A more complete list of words in these categories mayb c found in  \[14\]  . 

The metarules in our two-level grammar illustrate tile specific subset of English grammar defined in this paper  . The subset includes declarative sentences with the subject noun premed  ; fled and postmodilled , including postmodification by relative clauses . The choice of this subset is rather arbitrary since we have used two-level grammars to define a wide variety of English sentences  ( e . g . in\[7\] , more extensive modification is allowed and also compound sentences  )  . This subset will serve to illustrate the power of two-level grammars for the purposes of defining English syntax  . Because the notation for metarules follows contextfree grammar conventions using natural anguage vocabulary  , our recta-grammar is fairly self-explanatory . 
The rules of English syntax that have been incorporated into our grammar are based on English grammar rules given in  \[3\]  ,  \[11\] ,  \[131 , and\[19\] . 
We no we numerate the metarules used in our two -level grammar of English  . A scntence consists of a noun phrase and a verb phrase  . The noun phrase consists of an optional sentence modifier such as a " viewpoint " adverbial and a subject sequence  . The subject sequence consists of two main subjects  , separated by the coordinator and . The main subjects may be either a list of nouns premed  ; fled and postmodified or a proper name premodific d by a restricter  .

The object sequence of a verb phrase can contain both direct and indirect objects followed by an optional adverbial such as a maximizing adverb or a time adverb  .

We now turn to the pro-noun-modifiers specified in our grammar  . The modifier is a determiner optionally followed by a list of possessive nouns  , an adjective , a sequence of nouns , another list of possessive nouns and a denominal noun  . Examples of this type of construct include " the murderer's empty black pistol " and " a very rich man's thick wallet  . " For context-sensitive purposes , the determiners are divided into " universal " determiners which may precede both singular and plural nouns and determiners which may only precede singular nouns  . Furthermore , a context-frcc restriction of the pro-noun -modifiers is that thcrc can be at most one list of possessive nouns in a sequence  . For convenience we choose to enforce this condition in the hypcr rules instead of the metarules  .

The nouns in the NOUNSEQUENCE denote the physical composition of items  ( e . g .

" her social life " and " his moral responsibility "  )  . Since there are a large number of these , we omit their formal specification here .

4. HYPERRULESFORENGLISH
The hyperrules of tile two-level grammar for English define the context-sensitive aspects of English syntax which cannot be specified by the contextfree rules ef the recta-grammar  . Unlike the metagrammar , the hyperrulss do not generate any part of the English sentence  . They serve only to verify the context-sensitive conditions of the grammar  . This is done by using predicates , ~ described earlier . Predicates will derive the empty string if they are satisfied and will derive nonterminal strings of useless symbol sotberwise  . The not im ~ that tile hyperrul cs will not generate any terminal string but instead verify context-sensitive eonditions of a terminal str ing already generated by the context-h'ee mcta rules is annique feature of our approach to designing two-level grammars  ( e . g . in contrast , see\[2\]) . This will greatly simplify parsing two-level g rammars as we will see later  . 
We will define two types of predicates . The first of these will be preceded by the protonotion condition and will be given explicitly in the formal grammar  . As with the recta-grammar , however , there will be some rules which cannot bc precisely defined in the formal system  . These rules relate to qualities of the unspecified lexicale lass c ~  ( e . g . nouns , vm'bs , etc . ) and will be designated by the protonotion where . For exaln plc , the hypernotions where NOUN is singular , where VERB is past part lelple , and where NOUN and VERB agree in person and number call not bc precisely defined except by a very large number of formal rules such ms those given below : where aard vark is singular : EMPTY  . 
where abandone dispast participle IEMPTY.
where Adamandere agree in person and number : EMPTY  . 
In the subseqnent discussion of hyperrules we will use the not  , ation Itu to denote hyperrule number n . The start hypcr rule ( Ill ) of the two-level granunar is : 1 , SENTENOE : condition SENTENOE is a well-formed sentence  . 
This hyperrule has as its start notion an English sentence which is wellformed with respect to the contextfree rules or the recta-grammar for metanotion SENTENCE  . The next hyperrule ( H2 ) expands the sentence with respect to what conditions must be satisfied  . The formalization of these is self-explanatory . 
2 . condition SENTEN(IE_MODIFIERSUBJECT_SEQ , UENOIgAUXILIARY_SEQUENCE VERBOBJECT_SEQUENCE

The first condition is that the subject sequence must agree with the predicate specified by the auxiliary sequence and verb  . In on rgramms r , agreement means that the subject and the subject verb must agree in person and ! mmbcr  . There are two possibilities for snbject-verbs : 1 ) the auxiliary sequence i a empty ( It 3 ) iu which c~sc the main verb must be consistent with the subject  , and 2 ) th cauxiliary scqu cnc cisu on-empW ( H4 ) in w fiiehcase it is the auxiliary verb which must be consistent wit  . h the subject : Subjec ~ . smay be in our of three forms : l ) the subject is a proper name ( II5 )  , possibly modified by arc strict cr(c . g . " even Mr . Smith " or " primarily Mrs . Jones ") , and therefore requires ~ singular verb ;  2 ) the subject is a single subject ( H6-HT ) in wbich case it need only agree wi~h . the subject verb ; or 3 ) the subject may bca compound subject coordinated with and  ( fIS-II9 )  , in which cascitreqnires a plural verl ) ( e . g .

To satisfytile second condition that tile subject of a sentence must b c wellformed  , the subject may fall into one of the following categm'ies :  1  ) if the subject is a name ( II 10 )  , then it is already wellformed by the metarules ; 2) if the subject is modified ( till ) , then the modifiers must be correct ; and 3 ) if the subject is a componnd subject ( I 112 )  , then each component of the compound subject must be wellformed according to rules  1 and 2  .

12 . condition IMAIN__SUBJEOT1 trod MAIN_SIJB JECT2 is a wellformed subject : condition MAIN_SUBJECT I is a well-formed subjcct  , condition MAIN_SUBJE ( JT2 is a well-remind subjcct . 
Correctness of modification implies that a subject must bccorrectly l  ) remodilied and postmodific d . We first give the hyperru\[es which enforce correct premodification  . Premodifieatiml ( H13 ) requires 1 ) correct determiner usage ( i . e . with respect to singular and plural nouns ) and 2 ) any prc modifying nouns must be singular or " mass " nouns  ( i . e . nouns which denote item composition such as aluminum  , bra~ss , etc . ) . A singular determiner ( e . g . a , an , each , etc . ) requires a siugular noun ( Ill 4 ) but a " universal " determiner ( e . g . some , the , etc . ) may bc used with singular or plural nouns ( II 15 )  . If there arc no premodifying nouns , then hyperrul cIll 6 will apply . A single premodifying noun ( II 17 ) may bceither singular or a mass noun . Note that rn le Il l7 is nondeterminlstic in that there are two hyperalternativ cs  . The cond it . ion is satisfied if either on c of these hypcr rules is satisfied  . If the premodifyinguouns are coordinated with and  ( 1118 )  , then both nouns must be mass norms ( e . g . " the wooden and irondoor " is correct but " the forest and garden path " is not  )  .

The type of verb mast correspoud to the number of objects in the sentence : if the verb is intransitive  , then no objects are allowed except for adverbs ( ti28 )  ; if the verb is transitive , then a direct object is required ( H29) ; and if the verb is ditransitive , then both a direct and an indirect object are required  ( I 130 )  .

The fourth condition for a wellformed sentence is that the auxiliary adverbs and main verb are in correct grammatical sequence  , if I , here are no auxiliary verbs ( H31) , then tile auxiliary sequence is correct according to the recta-grammar  . If auxiliary verbs are present hen the verb must be a past partieiple  ( II 32 )  .

ACTIVE_OR_PASSIVE_ , AUX/LIARY VERB is a wellformed predicate : where VERB is a past participle  . 
The fifth and final condition which must be satisfied is fro " the object of the sentence to be wellformed  . A simple object ( H33 ) must satisfy the same conditions as a subject and hyperrules  H10-H12 will apply recursively . An object sequence ( H34 ) is wellformed if the indirect and direct objects are wellformed  . 
33 , condition OBJE ( 3T OBJECT_SEQUENCE_ADVERB is a wellformed object : condition OBJECT is a wellformed subject  .

It can be seen that the above set of hyperrules i relatively concise and the conditions being described are readily understandable  . We claim that the other goals of consistency , precision ( for our subset of English ) , and unambiguity are also achieved . In the next section it will be shown how this specification may be implemented automatically  . 
5. TWO-LEVEL PARSIN(I
Our method of natural language specification has two-lev cls : metarules for e ontex V free syntax and hyperrules for context-sensitive syntax  . Similarly our method of parsing a two-level gramma requires a parser for metarules and a parser for hyperrules  . Since the metarules are contextfree , any of the wellknown contextfree paining algorithms  ( e . g . 
see\[17\] ) may be used to derive a contextfree structure of some input sentence  . Context-free parsing will eliminate all sentences which do not satisfy the contextfree syntax of the language but is unable to eliminate respect to context-sensitive syntax  . The hyperrule parser will furthe reduce the set of sentences which arc considered to be grammatically valid by analyzing the contextfree parse tree for context-sensitive violations  . 
The " parser " for the hyperrules i actually an interpreter developed by the authors in  \[4\] which evaluates the hyperrules in much the same way as a progrannning language interpreter executes programs  . The hyperrules are interpreted sequentially in the order that conditions are enumerated in the grammar  . Interpretation proceeds by expanding the stm't notion and applying the hyperrules to all of the branches of the hypcr rule derivation tree until all of the prcdicatcs are evaluated  . As interpretation proceeds , each node of the derivation tree ( corrcs ponding to a hypernotion ) is expanded by matching it with a hyperrule l cf t -h and sld c  . The right hand side of the matched hyperrule is then used to create a subtrcc for that node  . Each branch of tile tree is evaluated from left to right in a prc ~ ord cr traversal  . The English sentence is syntactically correct if and only if the resulting terminal string derived by t be hyp cr rulc tree is the empty string  . 
The method of writing hyperrules to derive only the einpty string greatly simplifies the parsing process  . Traditionally ( e . g .  \[2 ,  10\]) , ~ wo-lcvel grammars use tile hyperrules to generate the terminals ~ rings of the language with the metarules being used only to instantiat c hyperrules  . For example , in our grammar the metanotion SI?NTENCE is nscd to generate English sentences which arct ben input to the hyperrules for an Mysis  . In other two-level grammar styles , however , the components of thc sentence would also be generated by hypcr rules  . The result of hyperrules generating terminal strings is that parsing bccmnes considerably more difficult and is not accomplished without restrictions being placcd on hypcr rules  ( e . g .  \[15\]) . 
Our method of interpreting hypcrrnles places no restric l  , ions , thcrclor callowing the tlg to be more gencral . The differences in writing styles are cxplored further in  I4\]  . 
The hyperrule interprct at kmalgor itbm is outlined below : 
Procedure EvMuute(hypcrnotion ) 1 . Findtile hyperrule to apply wM ch hastim hypernotion as its left  . : h and side . This rule will bc of the form : hypernoff on : hypernotioa-I  , hyperaot fon-2 ,   . . . , hypernoth > u-n . 
2 . Expand the derivation tree with hypernotion tts the root of the currents nb tree ~ nd tile branches being hypernvtion-t  , hypernolion . .2, , hypernotfon-n . 
3 . Evaluate(hypernntion-i ) for i ~ = 1, 2 ~ . ., n . 
To explain how this interpreter works , consider the exampl c sentence " Professor White and the students who attend the university gave Mrs  . 
White a present oday . " This sentence is seen to be correct , with respect o contextfree syntax and its structural representation is shown in  1  , ' ignre 1 . 
The specific metarules applied arc numbered . We will now apply the hyperrules to this sentence to show how the context-sensitive conditions arc verified  . For notational convenience we have italicized the protonotions which correspond to metanotions in the hyperrules  . Since the tree will bctraversed from left to right we will label the branches  ( i . e . nodes ) using an mnber ( 08 ) to denote the level in the tree and a letter ( ae ) to indie a Lelcf ~ to right ordering . 
The root of the hyperrulc derivation tree is the sentence itself  . 
\[ IyperrulcHI will be applied to initiate the verification process  . This will be followed by H2 which divides the derivation tree into five separate branches  , one for each condition which the sentence must satisfy  . 
0 ? Professor White and the ~ tudents who attend the university gave Mrs  . 
White a present oday.
1 ? condition Professor White and the students who attend the university gave Mrs  . White a present oday , is a wellformed sentence 2a * condition Professor White and the students who attend the university ghows subject-predicate agreement with gave  2b * condition Professor White and the students who attend then niversity is a wellformed subject  2c ? condition a present oday shows object-predicate agreement with gave  2d * condition gave is a wellformed predicate 2e ? condition a present oday is a wellformed object To expand branch  2a and cheek the first condition , hyperrule H3 ( no anxiliary verbs ) is applied . Since the subject is compound , rule H9 will be applied , requiring the verb to be plural . The " library " predicate will verify the plurality of gave  . 
2a ? condition Professor White and the student8 who attend the university shows subject-predicate greement with gave  3a ? condition Professor White and the students who attend the university agrees in person and number with gave  4a ? where gave is plural 5a ?tly per rule H12 will be applied to expand branch 2b and decompose the compound subject into its components  . IIy per rules lt l0 and Illl will then analyz each of the two respective sub-subjects for well-fm'medness  . 
2b * condition Professor White and the students who attend the university is a wellformed subject  3b * condition Professor White is a wellformed subject  4b  *  3c * condition the students who attend the university is a wellformed subject  4e * condition the students is correct in premodification  4d   . condition the students who attend the university is correct in postmodifieation Proceeding to construct hetr ceill a left-to-right manner  , branch 4c is expanded next using hyperrule It 13 . Since file determiner is universal and ~ here is no premodifying noun sequence  , hypcr rules It 15 and H16 complete this subtree . 
4c ? condition the students is correct in premodifieation  5b * condition the correctly premodifies students 6a  ?  5c ? condition EMPTY are singular or mass nouns 6b * The expansion of branch 4d is one of the more interesting aspects of the context-sensitive analysis since it involves a relative clause  . The analysis is performed by hyperrules HI9 , H21 , ti22 and H27 . Note that rule II27 rearranges ~ hc relative clause into a new sentence and reem'sively calls hyperrule  H2 to analyze the new sentence . 
4d o condition the students who attend the university is correct in postmodification  5d ? condition who attend then niversity correctly postmodifies the students  6c   . condition students is a human noun 7a * where , students is a hllill D . n noun 8&  ?  6d ? condition the verb of who attend then niv crslty agrees with the students  7b * condition the students attend the university , is a wellformed sentence Instead of expanding branch  7b further , wc will resmneml r example at branch 2c to verify the condition that the origin M sentence must have object-predicate agreement  . Since the object sequence contains an indirect object  , direct object and an adverb , hyperrule H30 will be Nlplied next and since the verb gave is ditransitive  , object-predicate agreement will he satisfied . 
2e * condition Mrs . White a present today shows object-predicate agreement with cave  3d * where gave is ditransitive 4e ? Returning to the toplevel conditions , we next verify the well-form cdness of the verb gave  . Since there arc no auxiliary verbs , hyp cr rule lt 31 is satisfied . 
2d ? condition gave is a wellformed predicate 3e ? The final condition that the sentence must satisfy is well-form cdness of the object  . Since the object is a sequence , rule H34 will be applied to branch 2c to decompose tile object sequence and analyze the indirect and direct objects individually by rule  H33  . Rule Itaa calls rules II10-II12 recursively . 
Since Mrs . White is a named subject , hyperrule H10 is satisfied for tile indirect object . By applying hypcr rules\[I11 , II 13 , HI4 , H16 , It 19 and 1120 , the direct object a present will also be verified as a wellformed object  . The analysis is now complete and the sentence has been determined to be correct throughtile process of our two qevel grammar interpretation method  . 
6. CONCLUSIONS
We have shown that two-level grammars may be used very elegantly to give a formal specification of Ignglish context-fl'ec and context-sensitive syntax  . In addition to the subset we have defined in this paper  , many other types of Nnglish declarative sentences have been formMly specified using two-level grammars  7\]  . There seems to be no obstacle to using rig specifications for any type of natural anguage syntactic specification  . 
Tile principal advantages of the two-level grammar mct Manguage are:  1  ) it is very readable and may be used to give a formal description using a structured form of natural anguage  ;  2 ) it is formal with many wellknown mathematical properties  ; and 3 ) it is directly implcmentable by interpretation . The significance of the latter fact is that once we have written a two-level grammm'for natural anguage syntax  , we can derive a parser automatically without writing any additional specialized computer programs  . The combination of readability and implementability is unique in grammar theory for natural anguages  . 
To give a complete spccification of natural language  , semantics and knowledge representation must be specified in addition to syntax  . Our future goals are the investigation of two -level grammar for semantic specification  . Because of the ease with wtfich two-level grammars may express logic  \[6\] and their Turing computability \[12\]  , we expect that tlgs will also b cvery suitable for these goals  .
