Little notice has been taken of punctuation in the field of natural language processing  , chiefly due to the lack of any coherent theory on which to base implementations  . Some work has been carried out concerning punctuation and parsing  , but much of it seems to have been rather ad hoc and performance-motivated  . This paper describes the first step towards the construction of a theoretically-motivated account of punctuation  . Parsed corpora are processed to extract punctuation patterns  , which are then checked and generalised to a small set of General 
Punctuation Rules . Their usage is discussed , and suggestions are made for possible methods of including punctuation information in grammars  . 
1 Introduction
It ither to , the field of punctuation has been almost completely ignored within Natural Language Processing  , with perhaps the single exception of the sentence -final full stop  ( period )  . The reason for this non-treatment has been the lack of any coherent heory Of punctuation on which a computational treatment could be based  . As a result , most contemporarys stem simply strip out punctuation i input text  , and do not put any marks into generated texts . 
Intuitively , this s~ems very wrong , since punctuation is such an integral part of many written languages  . If text in the realworld ( a newspaper , for example ) were to appear without any punctuation marks , it would appear very stilted , ambiguous or infantile . Therefore it is likely that any computational system that ignores these extra textual cues will suffer a degradation in performance  , or at the very least a great restriction in the class of linguistic data it is able to process  . 
Several studies have already shown the potential for using punctuation within NLP  . Dale ( 1991 ) has shown the positive benefits of using punctuation ill the fields of discourse structure and semantics  , suggesting that it can be used to indicate degrees of rhetorical balance and aggregation between juxtaposed elements  , and also that in certain cases a punctuation mark can determine the rhetorical relations that hold between two elements  . 
In the field of syntax Jones (1994) has shown , through a comparison of the performance of a grammar that uses punctuation and one which does not  , that for the more complex sentences of real language  , parsing with a punctuated grammar yields around two orders of magnitude fewer parses than parsing with an nn punctuated grammar  , and that additionally the punctuated parses better reflect the linguistic structure of the sentences  . Briscoe and Carroll ( 1995 ) extend this work to show the real contribution that usage of punctuation can make to the syntactic analysis of text  . They also point out some fundamental problems of the approach adopted by 
Jones (1994).
If , based on the conclusions of these studies , we are to include punctuation in NLP systems it is necessary to have some theory upon which a treatment can be based  . Thus far , the only account available is that of N unberg ( 1990 )  , which although it provides a useful basis for a theory is a little too vague to be used as the basis of ' any implementation  . In addition , the basic implementation of Nunberg's punctuation linguistic seems untenable  , certainly on a computational level , since it stipulates that punctuation phenomena should be treated on a seperate level to the lexical words in the sentence  ( Jones ,  1994) . It is also the case that Nunberg's treatment of punctuation is phenomena that occur in real language  ( Jones ,  :1995) . 
Therefore it is necessary to develop a new theory of punctuation  , that is suitable for computational implementation  . Work has already been carried out on the variety of punctuation marks and their interaction  ( Jones ,  :1995) , showing that whilst tile set of symbols that we conventionally regard as punctuation  ( point punctuation , quotation and parenthetical symbols ) account for the majority of punctuation in the written language  ( and therefore conld be implemented in a standardised way  )  , there is another set of more unusual symbols , usually with a higher semantic ontent , which tend to be specific to the corpus in which they occur and therefore art  ; less suited to a standardised treatment . This study also shows that the average number of punctuation symbols to be expected in a sentence of English is four  , thus reinforcing the argument for the inclusion of pnnct nation in language processing systems  . 
Tile next step towards the devek ) pnmnt of a theory of punctuation is the study of the interaction of punctuation and the lexical items it separates  , in particular the way that punctuation will integrate into grammars and syntax  . 
The major problem of the ewduatory studies , ( Dale (199 l) , Jones (1994) , and to a far lesser : extent Briscoe & Carroll ( 1995 ) ) , was that their coverage and use of pun <: tuation was rather poor  , being necessarily based on human intuitions and possible idiosyncrasies  . What is needed therefore is a proper investigation into the syntactic roles that punctuation symbols can play  , and at brmal-isation of these into instructions for the inclusion of punctuation in N\]+ grammars  . 
2 Data Collection
The best data sources are parsed corpora . Using these ensures a wide range of language is covered  ; since they are hand-parsed or checked tile parse will be  ( nominally ) correct ; and since there are many parsers/editors no individual's intuitions or idiosyncrasies will dominate  . The set of parsed corpora is sadly very small but still su I\[icient to yield use fl fl results  . 
The corpus chosen was the Dow Jones section of the Pennrl Yeebank  ( size : 1 . 95 million words ) . The bracketings were analysed so that each ' node ' that has a puuctu ~ ttion mark as it simme  ( liate daughter is reported , with its other daughters abbreviated to their categories  , as in . ( i ) - (3) .

These sets were then processed by hand to extract the underlying rule patterns from the raw category-patterns since these will include instances of serial repetition  ( 4 ) and lexical ' break through ' in cases where phrases are not marked in the original corpus  ( 5 )  . 
(4)\[NP = NP , NP , NP , NP or NP\](5)\[NP :-= each project , or activity pp\]These underlying rule-patterns represent all the ways that punctuation behaves in this corpus  , and are good indicators of how the punctuation marks might behave in the rest of language  . In the next sections we try to generalise these rule-patterns and discuss their possible implementation  . 
3 Experimental Results
There were 12 , 7 00 unique category-patterns extracted fl : om the corpus for the live most common marks of point punctuation  , ranging from 9 , 320 fortile comma to 425 for the dash . 
These rules were then redu <' e < l to justlg Z underlying rule-patterns ik  ) r the colon , seinicolon , dash , comma , full stop . 
Even some of these underlying rule-patterns , however , a requestionable since their incidence is very low  ( may be once in the whole corpus ) or their : for missolinguistically stranges o as to  ( : all into doubt their correctness ( possibly idiosyncratic mis-parses )  , as in (6) . 
((3)\[ADVI'-'=PI',NP\]
Therefore all the patterns were = checked against the original corpus to recover the original sentences  . '\[' he sentences for patterns with low incidence and those whose correetne  . ss was ( luestionable were . careNlly examined to ( letermine whether there was arty justitication for a particula rule-pattern  , given the content of these utenee . 
Taking the subset of rules relating to the coh ) n , for example , shows that there are 27 underlying rule patterns from the original analysis  , as shown in table 1 .

The only real underlying patterns are those in table  2  . 
The rest of the rule-patterns were eliminated because they represented idiosyncratic bracketings and category assignments in the original corpus  , and so were covered by other rules . It should also be noted that some incorrect category assignments were made at the earlier data analysis stages  , which explains why several of the revised rules have non-phrasal-level leftmost daughters  . 
Here are some examples of the inappropriate rule patterns  . 
? S:NP:S--inappropriate because the mother category should really be NP  . Instances of this pattern in the corpus ( 7 ) are no different to instances of the similar rule with a NP mother and the pattern is more suited to a nominal interpretation  . The problem has arisen in this case through confilsion of sentential and top categories in the grammar  . 
Ahnost all items in the corpus are marked as sentences  , although not all fulfil that grammatical role .

It should be noted , however , that whilst all the twelve patterns in table 2 are valid , not all of them are normal colon expansions . There are seven exceptions . Significantly though , all the rule-patterns are in agreement with the description of colon use that can be found in publishers ' style guides  ( Jarvie ,  1992) , which even cite the exceptional cases found here . 
PP~-I':NI .   .   .   . uses the colon merely to introduce a conjunctive structure  ( 10 ) -possibly one which is structurally separated fi ' om the preceding sentence fi'agment in  , say , an itemised list and that has quite linguistically complex items  .

If the exceptional cases are ignored , it is relatively straightforward to postulate some generalisations about the use of the wu:ious punctuation marks  . 
(' , ( ) loll expansions seem only to occur in descriptive contexts  . Thus their mother category can be either NP ors , descriptive c~t tegories , rather than the active vl ' or locative l'p . The mother category of a colon expansion is always the s~uJm as the category to which the adjunct is a  . ttachod ( the lel't-n , ostd:mghter ) and this is event . rue of many of the exceptional rule patterns if the constraint is relaxed to allow the daughter to haw ~ a lower bar-level  . The phrase contained within the colon-exl ) ansion ( rightmost daughter ) nn lst also be descriptive , but can be AI ) JP in addition to NP and s .

( m)T = ?.
The dash interpolation is the first punctuation mark for which generalisation becomes slightly complicated  . There appear to be two general rules , which overlap slightly . The first ( 20 ) simply states that a dash interpolation can contain an identical category to the phrase it follows  . The second rule ( 21 ) extends this rule when applied to the two descriptive categories  , so that a wider range of categories are permitted within the interpolation again  , one of the rule-patterns permitted by ( 21 ) does not actually occur in the corpus , but does seem plausible . Note that since these rules in corpora teafinal dash  , they will rely on Nunberg's ( 1990 ) principle of point absorption to delete the final dash if necessary  .

The gener Misation seems to be that all y combination of phrasal categories is OK  , so long as one of the daughter categories is identical to them other category  ( 22 a & b )  . The restriction on this , and the reason why there are fewer rule-patterns for categories such as pP  , ADJP and ADW' , is that rules with the same daughters but more ' powerful ' mother categories  ( e . g . sentential vs . adverbial ) seem to be able to block the application of the ' less powerful ' rules  .

There are three existing hypotheses to choose from  . The theory of Nunberg ( 1990 ) is that punctuation should be treated in a ' text grammar' on a separate level to the lexical grammar  . However , as pointed out by Jones (1994) , it is difficult to see how this would be feasible in practice and there is little linguistic or psychological motivation for such a separation of lexicMtext and punctuation  . 
Therefore Jones (1 . 994 ) fully integrates punctuation and lexicM grammar , and in effect treats punctuation marks as clitics on words  , introducing additional features into normal syntactic rules  ( 27 )  . riseoe and Carroll (190) , however , point out that this rnM~es it hard to extract an independant text grammar or introduce modular semantics  . Therefore their grammar keeps the punctuation and part-of-speech rules separate  , but still allows them to be applied in an interleaved manner  , in effect finding the happy mediu in between the two extreme approaches  . Hence , additionally , their rules include the punctuation marks as distinct entities  , rather than cliticising them , although they still require extra features to ensure proper application of the rules  ( 28 )  . 
(27 ) rip\[stS\]np\[stc\]np\[tS\]' ( 28 ) V2\[wn- , 1NV-\]-+H2\[WlI- , HN+ , -ta\]-I-pco2VI\[vFORMIN ( l\]The most appropriate method would seem to be a combination of the two integrated methods above  , combining their modularity , flexibility and power . Thus the Generalised Punctuation Rules obtained above could be encoded into a normal syntactic grammar to add punctuation capabilities  . However , this will Mrnost certainly result in overgeneration of parses  , a stile rules are still to of lexible : they accurately describe syntactic situations where punctuation Call occur  , but fail to place any constraints upon those situations  . 
Itence some further theoretical work seems to be required to constrain the applicability of these rules  . 
The main location for punctuation marks is likely to be with phrasal-level items  , whether the marks occur before a particular phrasal item or after it  . Punctuation does not seem to occur at levels below the phrasal  , with one exception : punctuation is allowed to occur at any level in the context of coordination  . Thus ( 29 ) represent slg represents a variable 2 + pco represents a comma since it occurs adjacent othe AD  . n ' within the NP . However , in ( 30 ) there is no phrasal item for the punctuation to attach to  , and so its use is unsanctioned . Conjunctive punctuation use can bcseen in (31) , where although occurring below the level of NP , the pnnctuation is legal because of its e o n j m m t i v e c o n t e x t  .

To generalise , then , l ) unctuation seems to have adjunctive and conjunctive functions  , and the theoretical formalisation of these function will form a good method of constraining the l  ) arses produced with the Generalised Rules above . 
6 Conclusion
We have seen that by extracting punctuation patterns from a corpus it has been possible to postulate a small number of generalisations for punctuation rules within NL grammars  . A suitable methodology for applying tmnctuation to existing grammars has also been suggested  . Since many of the rule pattern seem to have a w ' xylow frequency of occurrence it may also be useflfl to collect such frequencies and use them in the rule generalisations to attach probabilities to various rule expansions  . We have also seen that the rule patterns we extracted fi'om the corpora agreed to a large extent with the descriptions of punctuation use found in publishers ' style-guides  , suggesting thai ; reference to these may be usefnl . 
What is needed now is a thorough testing and evaluation of the suggestions made in this paper  , both against lmnctuation patterns from other corpora and in parsing novel material  , to may be suggest better geimralisations . ' Fheu the next step towards a theory of punctuation can be carried out  , namely the analysis of punctuation for its semantic flmction and content  .
