hfformation structure can be of great use in linguistic applications  , especially in those involving a speech component . However , focus marking by prosody is often ambiguous . 
Existing theories capture this by rules that produce alternative focus structures  . This disjunction is hard to handle computationally  . In this paper , a compact , graphically underspecified representation is proposed  , along with composition principles and a resolution routine based on context information  . 
1 Introduction
This paper proposes an underspecified representation for information structure  ( IS ) and HPSG 1 principles that build up this representation for German  . The representation is designed as a basis for use in applications like text-to-speech and speech translation systems  . It is obvious that for a non-tiring , natural output , especially tile prosodic side of IS has to be taken into account  . In this section , examples from sentence-based translation with semantic transfer visualize the role of IS in several empirical domains  . For one thing , ignoring IS may result in confusing translations :   ( 2 ) with default accenting , 2 despite being truth-conditionally equivalent , is not a suitable translation for ( 1B ) in tile given context . System users will probably presume that a serious mistranslation occured  .

Concluding the set of initial examples ,   ( 5 ) shows that focus call play a role in simple ilf fere nees drawn from contextore solve lexical ambiguities  ( or similarly for ellipsis and anaphora resolution )  .

Since tile ambiguous Be such in ( 5 ) is not focus-marked , it has to be contextually given . Even a simple context model will resolve the reference back totile be such en event mentioned in tile preceding sentence  , so the noun visit is chosen as a translation . 
The last example showed that certain ambiguities require inferences from context  . However , the other examples make clear that focus can be effectively applied in sentence-based translation exploiting the existing linguistic focus marking within the sentence  . Costly reasoning can'thus be restricted to doubtful cases  . 

A sentence-based account of IS faces one problem : in the general case  , a certain prosodic marking of a sentence does not correspond to a unique IS  . These cases of focus ambiguity have been discussed extensiw ~ ly in the literature and will be briefly reviewed in see  .  2 . The existing HPSG account of IS by Engdahl/Val lduvi  ( 1994 ) gelmr-ales a disjunction of alternative sentence analyses for ambiguou sentences  , a Since focus ambiguity mull ; Jiffies with all other kimts of ambiguity , a disjunctive treatment makes the use of IS in computational applications unattractiw  ;  . Therefore , an underspecified representation of IS is proposed in this paper  ( sec .  3 ) along with a resolution routine on the basis of context information  ( see .  4) . Finally , the linguistic principles that compose the representation are worked out in HPSG  ( see .  5) . 
The data discussed are Gerlnan , but English is very similar . 
2 Focus marking
The basic data are wellknown . 4 A pitch accent on a direct object like , Buchin (7) , can serve to mark a number of constituents as focused :  ( 8 )  . 5 The focus Dature is usually assumed to proje . ct .

These data can be explained by the h ) llowing F-Assignment Rules fi-om ( Selkirk , 1995): a (11) Basic F Rule
An accented word is F-marked.
a The same is truefl ) r practically all accounts of focus projection that I am aware of-of  . , e . g . , ( Selkirk ,: 1995; Schwarzschild , 1995) . 
4 For German , cf ., e.g ., ( tIShle , 1982).
5The standard means to determine the focus of an utterance is the question test  , where the tbcus in the answer corresponds to the interrogative constituent in the question  . However , this test can be misleading in cases where the question comes in a wider context  ( ef . (16) below and the discussion in ( Knhn , 1996)) . 
~ Rule (12b ) may need some refinement . It is not clear whether it is a syntactic condition that constrains in direct F-marking of a head  . Jacobs ( 1994 ) argues that the notion of integration or ir ~formational autonomy is resimnsible instead  , which is baaed on the complexity in semantic processing  . Unibrt unatcly , the formal nature of integration is still ill -understood  . 
(12) F Projection a . F-marking of the head of a phrase licenses the F -marking of tile phrase  . 
b . F-marking of an internal argument of a head licenses the F-marking of the head  . 
According totiles (; rules , the head itself can project focus , which appears to be refuted by ( b ~ talike the following . 
(13) Karlhatein Buch\[GEIA !: SI'\]N . \] F However ,   ( 13 ) can have a wider focus if books are contextually given  ( this effect has been called dcaccenting )  . Note the diiference between (14) and (15) , both marked according to ( 11 ) and ( 12 ) : although their maximal focus domain ix identical  , t in Buch is F-marked only in (15) . 
(14) Karlhat\[einBuch\[(;ELESEN . \]F\]F (15) Karlhat\[\[einBuc:n\]l , , \[ gelesen . \] FJF This is reflected in Schwarzs e hild's ( 1995 ) in-terl ) retation of the F-feature . All constituents that are not F-marked need to be given  , where givenness is defined an entaihnent by prior discourse  . Entaihnent is extended to expressions of other type than propositions by existentially binding unfilled arguments  .   7 Even non-F-marked constituents embedded in an F -marked constituent  , like em Buchin ( 14 ) have to pass this givenness filter . So , deaccenting is no longer a special case for the theory  . 
To restrict the optional focus projection from ( 12 ) fllrther , Schwarzs child assumes an additional pragmatic filter Avoid F that selects the tree with the least F-marking  . sNon-F-marked constituents that contain F-marked subconstituents need to begiw mas well  . 
The context has to entail their F-skeleton the 7The exact definition is as t bllows ( ( Schwarzschild ,  1995) , pp .  56 . ): An expression T ( for target ) is GIVEN if fith a . s an antecedent , A , such that the existential closure of A entails the result of existentially binding F-variables in the existentially closed F-skeleton of T\[ where the existential quantifier binding F-w ~riablcs quantifies over contextually salient values \]  . 
The F-skeleton of an expression is the result of rc-placing F-marked elements witl  , variables ( working top to bottom ) . 
The existential closure of an expression is the result of existentially binding all unfilled arguments of the expression  .

8I ( : onsider the status of this filter somewhat problematic  . Why shmdd a tree with less F-marking be pragmatically preferred ? One could as well argue that since a sentence should be ~ s informative as possible  , given constituents should be avoided . The underspecified account dew floped here recasts Schwarzs child's ideas in a way that makes Avoid F redundant  .

She has a whiterose photographed
A's question leads to expect focus marking of the complete VP  , but intonational marking plus projection rules produce a narrow focus on weifle  . 
Schwarzschild ( 1995 ) predicts the indicated F-marking , since the F-skeleton of the NP eine we if le Rose , for instance , ( a X rose ) is actually entailed by the context . 
While non-F-marked constituents have to be given , F-marked constituents need not necessarily be new  . This is to account for data like the following , where ihn in ( 17 B ) is given: ( 17 ) A : We nhat Peters Muttergel obt ?
Whom has Peter's mother praised ?
B : Sichat\[IHN\]Fgelobt.
She hash impraised
The indicated F-marking follows from the theory : there has to be some F-marking  , since the meaning of the complete sentence ( Peter's mother praised Peter ) is not entailed by the context . The F-skeleton variant Peter's mother praised X is actually entailed by the question  ( 17 A )  , thus the F-marking of ihn . 
3 An underspec i f ied representat ion In computational pplications  , a compact representation is a prerequisite for any successful treatment of IS  . Take the following short sentence with two pitch accents  . 
(18 ) Die Direktor in der Firma MU LL ER BE GR US ST The director of company Miiller welcomes ihren Besuch  . 
her visit/visitors
Even if functional elements are ignored , the rules in ( 12 ) produce nine alternative F-markings that have to be checked against the context for givenness  . In order to resolve the lexical ambiguity of Besueh however  ( cf . the discussion of (5) above ) , some partial information about IS suffices . 
The representation developed here is relatively independent of the underlying semantic theory of focus  . Two semantical partitions for focus ( FOC ) and background ( BG ) are assumed , each of them a set of semantic on ditions . Underspecification is expressed in a graphical way  . The interpretation 1?   9There is some affinity to the f-semantic value in Rooth ' s  ( 1985 ) alternative semantics , although the specific details are different . 
rathe interpretation is given informally in the following examples  .

The solid linear rows signify obligatory inclusion in the respective IS partition  , the dashed linear rows defeasible inclusion . The VP can , e . g . , either belong to FOC ( via a chain of arrows ) or to BG . The graph in ( 20 ) represents the amount of information that is encoded on sentence level without reference to context  . Additional knowledge may introduce further solid arrows  . If , e . g . , a begriiflen event is contextually given ( like in a question Who greets whom ? )  , the arrow from begri if lt to BG will become an obligatory arrow  . 
This arrow again will overrule the dashed arrow from begri if lt to ihren Be such  . Since the latter was the only path to access the FOC partition  , the complete graph will collapse into a fully specified representation fIS  . Resolution will be dealt within more detail in sec  .  4 . 
The principles composing the representation are worked out formally in sec  .  5 . Here is an intuitive overview : the arrows pointing directly to the FOC and BG partition originate from accenting or non-accenting of the single words  , respectively . The additional arrows between the constituent nodes are introduced by the grammatical principles of F-projection irrespective of the actual prosodic marking  . This becomes clear when we regard the following alternative prosodic marking of  ( 19 ) :  ( 21 ) MARIABEGRUSS Tihren Be such .

BGFOG
Note that here , the dashed arrow from begri if lt to ihren Be such is over ruled right away  , since the accented begri if lt is strictly tied to FOC  . The tion , thus the utterance is correctly predicted to be restricted to contexts where Besueh is given  . 
As anticipated above in tile discussion of the lexical ambiguity involved  , this conelusioil can be drawn even if other points remain underspecified  . 
4 Resolution
An underspecified IS arising from tile prosodic marking of a sentence can be resolved by information from the context  . As noted above , entaihnent by context introduces additional solid linear rows  . 
rlb covet " more than just trivial cases , the ( : ounter-part of Schwarzs child's ( 1995 ) F-skeleton has to bckept track of in the underst ) ecified representation . 
At first glance , this seems to be incompatible with the idea of underspeeification  , since the F-skeleton that is checked agains the context for entailment  , require settlement on what the actual F-marking is  . For instance , to check the given ncss of the VP in (23) , reads a book about X has to be entailed , whereas on the basis of the marking in (24) , reads
Y has to be entailed.
(23) I % anzliestein Buch filler\[S('ml " FE . \]Fl ~' an zreads a book aboutships ( 24 ) bYanzliest\[einBuch filler\[ScHnq"m\]F\]F The solution lies in the observation that the latter F-skeleton entails the former  . So , when a certain constituent ( e . g . , again the VP in the abow ~ examples ) is checked for givenness , it suffices to assume F-marking of the maximal potentially F-marked subconstituents  ( I call this the maximality assumption )  . If it turns out that the actual F-marking is more restricted  , this will be detected at a lower level . For example , if (23) is the right solution , this will be discovered even if reads a book about X is not checked  , since in this case , a book about X will be contextually given as well . 
To illustrate resolution in tile graph representation  , take the following example in context : (25) a . Amtahat Ottofotografiert . 
Anna has Ot to photographedl ) . HANShatOttoeinBv(,ngegeben . 
Hans has to-Ot to a book given
Sentence ( 25 t ) ) produces the following graph : ( Hanshat Ottoein Buchgegeben , (3P , ueC)\[P ( u )\] ( Ot\[oe in Buchgegeben , (3R ~ C ) (~: ~)\ [ n(x , Otto )\]) // ( ein Buchgegeben , (3Q , zeC ) (3x , y)\[q(x , y , z )\] (26) 1/ , ~- .

BGFOC
The nodes are now labelled by pairs . The first element of a pair is tile semantic w flue of the constituent corresponding to the node  ( here again expressed in for lnally in natural language  )  ; the second eleinent is the F-skeleton based on the maximality assumption-the F-skeleton is obtained by  ( i ) replacing the maximal F-marked subconstituents ( or sister constituents , in the case of indirect F-marking of the head , following (12b )) by a variable , ( it ) existentially binding unfilled arguments , and ( iii ) existentially quantifying over the variables from the F-skeleton  ( cf . also fit .  7) . The latter quantification is restricted by the set of contextually salient values C  . 
In resolving underspecifieation from context , it is checked for each node with access to the BG t  ) artition ~ t whether its F-skeleton is entailed by an antecedent in the context  . For gegeben and the lowest verb projection e in Buchgcgeben  , there is no such antecedent in the context . However , for the VP Ottocin Buehge gebent he VP from ( 25 a ) Ott of o-tografiert is a suitable antecedent : after existential binding  , ( ~ x ) fo to grafieren(x , Otto ) entails(~RCC ) (3x)\[R(x , Otto)\] . Similarly for the con > plete sentence : fotogr Mieren  ( Anna , Otto ) entails (3e , uCC)\[P ( u)\] . So , solid linear rows replace the two dashed arrows pointing to BG  ( suggested in ( 26 ) by tile longer dashes )  . 
The status of tile lower verb projections in ( 26 ) is still underspecified . If a wider context was considered , antecedents could possibly be found , so it makes sense to end 1 , t ) with such a representation after processing the discourse  ( 25 )  . Once we know that all salient context has been considered  , a rule of I'bcusClosure is at ) plied . This strengthens the arrows pointing towards FO ( \] for all unresolved constituents , t ) redicting eiu Buch . q cg c be n as the focus for the example . In an at ) plication , heuristics may trigger Focus Closure earlier , to aw ) id unneecessary inferences . 
The representation proposed here comes close to Sehwarzs child's  ( 1995 ) theory of F-marking in coverage ,   . 2 avoiding the computationally ext ) en-sive disjunction of alternative analyses in favour of a single graphre I  ) resentation that is underspecified when based on sentence internal infer-n Constraining the give mms scheck to nodes with access to the BG partition makes sure that narrow  ( e ontrastive ) focus on given entities ( like in ( 17 ) ) is treated correctly . Since all acce . nt on a word introduces just a narrow towards FOC , narrow focus on a word survives the check even in cases where the word is given  . 
12 For examples with several ambiguous accents , the modified account collapse some F-markings with minimal diff crm  , cesininte . r p retation i to one . For instance , two of the twelve F-markings for ( i ) are indistinguishable: ( it ) and ( iii )  .

5 HPSG principles
The representation proposed in sec .   3 and 4 can be implemente directly in a sign-based formalism like HPSG  . In this section , tile central composition principles for German are worked out  . A binary branching structure is assumed . Again , the representation will be fairly open as to which particular semantic formalism is chosen  . This is reflected in tile Semantics Principle I assume  , which specifies the semantic value of a phrase as the application of a two-place function compose to the semantic values of both daughters  . The function can be spelt out in different ways depending on the choice of a semantic theory  , la Furthermore , a function variable is assumed that maps a semantic object to a new variable of the same type  . 
The HPSG type cont ( the value of the
CONT ( ENT ) feature ) has the following four new features : O-SEM ( ' ordinary semantics ' ) and I , '-SKEL ( F-skeleton ) of the type of a semantic object , tile set-valued IS-CSTR ( IS constraints ) and the binary MAX-F ( for potential maximal focus )  . 
The phonological information is enriched by a feature PROM  ( prominence ) with values accented and unaccented . 
The following principles specify the lS-CSTR set for a sign  , introducing arrows , or links , between ( i ) Der Direktor der SPARKASSE begr/it3te Frau The director of the saving s-bank greeted Frau

Maier ( ii ) DerDirektorder\[SPARKASSE\]F begrfiftte\[ Frau 
MA , E  ~ . \] F ( iii ) \ [ Der Direktorder\[SPARKASSE\]F\]F begrfiflte \[Frau MAIER  . \] F However , such a context is quite intricate to construct . 
Here is an example: ( iv ) Der Direktor der Firma ABCs at ~ imC~f ~ . 
The director of company ABCs at in the care
Der Kellner begri if lte eine Bekannte.
The waiter greeted afriend
Context ( iv ) does not entail der Direktor der X begri if lte Y , so ( ii ) is ruled out according to Schwarzs child's system . The resolution process proposed in this paper is based on the maximality assumption  , and thus checks givenness for the complete sentence only once  , with the complete subject F-marked . To rescue the difference between ( ii ) and ( iii )  , it would have to be enforced that resolution of the subject NP takes place before the resolution of the focus projected from the object  . This is a conceivable solution-however , declarative perspiguity would be sacrificed for a very moderate benefit  , considering the main point of this paper . 
lain the example below , simple predicate-argument semantics is used for illustration  . 
semantic objects .   ( TimIS partitions/oc and bg are here also treated as semantic objects  . ) The h_link relation corresponds to the obligatory  ( solid line ) arrows in the graphs , s_link reflects defeasible ( dashed line ) arrows . In the following , the link relations are expressed verbally . (27) is the counterpart to (11) ; (28) and (29) reflect clauses (12a ) and (12b ) . 
(27) Focus Linking Principle
The O-SEM value of a pitch accented word is h_linked to foe  . 
(28) Head F-Projection Principle
The O-SEM value of a phrase is s_linked to the
O-SEM value of its head daughter.
(29) Indirect Head F-Marking Principle
In a head-complement-structure , whren one of the head daughter's arguments have yet been saturated  ,   14 the O-SEM of the head daughter is s_linked to the O-SEM value of the complement daughter  . 
These three principles establish director indirect links towards foc  . For the constituents that are not obligatorily focus marked  , the underspecified representation requires additional defeasible links to bg:  ( 30 ) Background Linking Principle The O-SEM value of every sign that is not accented is s_linked to bg  . 
The principles just presented compose the representation introduced in sec  .  3 , with the nodes in the graph corresponding to the O-SEM values  . 
To provide the input for the resolution routine , the representation was enriched in sec . 4 by the F-skeleton . This is kept track of in the F-SKEL feature ( assuming independent existential binding of unfilled argmnents and free variables  )  . 
(31) F-Skeleton Instantiation
The F-SKEL value of a word with \[ O-SEM ( ~\] is ( i ) the function variable ( a )  , if ~ ish_linked to foc ; ( ii ) a , if the word is marked\[MAX-F__\] ; 15 ( iii ) eom position ( a , fl )   ( where fl is the F-SKEL value of the word's complement  )  , if the word is marked\[MAX-FJJ , but a is not h_linked to foe . 
(32) F-Skeleton Principle
The F-SKIn , value of a phrase is the function compose applied to  ( i ) the F-SKEL vahm of a daughter with \[ MAX-F--\] ; or ( ii ) the function variable ( a ) of a daughter with \[ MAX-FJ-\] and \[ O-SEMO ~\]  ; for both daughters . 
1 4This formulation will be subject to changes once there is a clear concept of integration  ( cf . f n . 6)-(29) applies to integrated constitnents . 
lS The feature MAX-F is actually redundant . It has been introduced for convenience , signifying that a chain of links to foe exists - a condition that could be checkedirectly in the graph  . But it does not hurt much to carry the feature along in the principles  ( 27 )   ( 29 )  .

Let us briefly see how the principles interact to produce the phrase e in  \]3uch gab ( For simplicity , the NP is treated as if it was a word ) . Since t in Buch bears a pitch accent , the Focus Linking Principle (27) applies , introducing an obligatory link to FOC ( h_link ( \[\] , foe )) . For the unaccented gab , the Background Linking Principle applies , giving rise to a defensible link ( s_link(N , bg )) . At phrase level , the Indirect Head F-Marking Principle ( 29 ) and the Head F-Marking Principle apply ( introducing s_link ( g\] , N ) for the head , and s_link(N , iN ) for the phrase , respectively ) . In addition , (27) applies again : s_link(iN , bg ) . 
As for the F-Skeleton , subclause(i ) of (31) applies atein Buch , subclause(iii ) at gab , causing the function compose to apply to gab's own semantic value and to its sister's F-SKEL value  . The phrase is covered by (32) , where both daughters are marked\[MAX-F+\] and thus fulfil subclause  ( ii )  .
