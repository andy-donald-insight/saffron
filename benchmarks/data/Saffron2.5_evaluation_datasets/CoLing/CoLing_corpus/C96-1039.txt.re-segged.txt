Various strategies are proposed to identify and classify three types of proper nouns in 
Chinese texts . Clues from character , sentence and paragraph levels are employed to resolve Chinese personal names  . 
Character , Syllable and Frequency
Conditions are presented to treat transliterated personal names  , To deal with organization ames , keywords , prefix , word association and parts-of-speech are applied . 
For fair evaluation , largescale test data are selected from six sections of a newspaper  . 
The precision and the recall for these three types are  ( 88 . 04%, 92 . 56%), (50 . 62%, 71 . 93%) and (61 . 79%, 54 . 50%), respectively . 
When the former two types are regarded as a category  , the performance becomes (81 . 46%, 91 . 22%) . Compared with other approaches , our approach as better performance and our classification is automatic  . 
1. Introduction
A Chinese sentence is composed of a string of characters without any word boundaries  , so that to segment Chinese sentences is indispensable in Chinese language processing  ( Chen , 1990; Chen ,  1994) . Many word segmentation techniques ( Chen & Liu , 1992; Chiang et al , 1992; Sproat & Shih , 1990) have been developed . However , the resolution of unknown words , i . e . , those words not in the dictionaries , form the bottleneck . Some papers ( Fung & Wu , 1994; Wang et al ,  1994 ) based on Smadja's paradigm ( 1993 ) learned an aided dictionary from a corpus to reduce the possibility of unknown words  . Chang et al ( 1992 ) proposed a method to extract Chinese personal names from an  11  , 000-word corpus , and reported 91 . 87% precision and 80 . 67% recall . Wang et al ( 1992 ) recognized unregistered names on the basis of titles and a surname-driven rule  . Lin et al .   ( 1993 ) presented a model to tackle a very restrictive form of unknown words  . Sproat et al ( 1994 ) considered Chinese personal names and transliterations of foreign words  . 
Their performance was 61 . 83% precision and 80 . 99% recall on an 12,000-Chinese-character corpus . 
This paper deals with three kinds of proper nouns -say  , Chinese personal names , transliterated personal names and organization ames  . We not only tell if an unknown word is a proper noun  , but also assign it a suitable semantic feature . In other words ,  '~?~4~ ~'  ( George Bush ) will have a feature of male transliterated personal name when it is identified  . Such a rigid treatment will be helpful for further application such as anaphora resolution  ( Chen ,  1992) , sentence alignment ( Chert & Chert , 1994; Chen & Wu ,  1995) , etc . Section 2 describes the training corpor and the testing corpus we used  . 
Sections 3 ,   4 and 5 propose tile identification and classification methods of Chinese personal names  , transliterated personal names and organization names  , respectively . Section 6 presents two applications . Section 7 concludes the remarks . 
2. Training Corpora and Testing Corpus
The proposed methods in this paper integrate the rule-based and the statistics-based models  , so that training corpora are needed . To test the performance of language models , a good testing corpus is also necessary . This section introduces all the corpora that are used in the following sections  . 
NTU balanced corpus , which follows the standard of LOB corpus ( Johansson ,  1986) , is the first training corpus . It is segmented by a word segmentation system and is checked manually  . In total , this corpus has 113 , 647 words and 191 , 173 characters . 
The second training corpus is extracted from three newspaper corpora  ( China Times , Liberty Times News and United Daily News ) . It is just segmented by a word segmentation system without checking manually  . Although segmentation errors may exist , this corpus is 23 . 2 times larger than NTU balanced corpus , so that we can get more reliable word association pairs  . 
The third training corpus is a transliterated personal name corpus  . There are 2 , 692 transliterated personal names , including 1 , 414 male's names and 1 , 278 female's names . Those transliterated personal names are selected from a book " English Names For Yon "  ( Huang ,  1992) . 
The last training data is a Chinese personal name corpus  . It has 219 , 738 Chinese personal names and 661 , 512 characters . 

Finally , the testing corpus is introduced . We randomly select six different sections from a newspaper corpus  ( Liberty Times News )  . The contents are different from the second training corpus  . The following shows the statistics of the testing corpus:  ( a ) the political section There are many items of news about the legislature  . It includes 23,695 words and 36,059 characters . 
( b ) the social section
There are many items of news about police and of fenders  . It includes 61,846 words and 90,011 characters . 
( c ) the entertainment section
There are many items of news about TV stars , programs , and so on . It includes 38,234 words and 55,459 characters . 
( d ) the international section
It contains many items of foreign news and has 19 , 049 words and 29 , 331 characters . 
( e ) the economic section
Many items of news about stock market , money , and so on , are recorded . It includes 39,008 words and 54,124 characters . 
( f ) the sports section
All items of news concerns ports . It includes 36,971 words and 54,124 characters . 
Every section has its own characteristics . In the political section , there are many titles . In the social section and the entertainment ~ ection  , there are many Chinese personal names and organization names  . In the international section , transliterated personal names are more than the other two  . In the economic section , stock companies often appear . In the sports section , there are many Chinese personal names and transliterated personal names  . Because the proper nouns are usually segmented into single characters  , they will interfere with one another during identification and classification  . 
3 . Chinese Personal Names 3 . 1 Structure of Personal Names Chinese personal names are composed of surnames and names  . Most Chinese surnames are single character and some rare ones are two characters  . 
The following shows three differentypes : ( a ) Single character like ' ~' ,  ~' , ' ~' and '-9:-' . 
(b ) Two characters like ' ~\[~' and ' k '(('.
(c ) Two surnames together like ' JI , ~'.
Most names are two characters and some rare ones are one character  . Theoretically , every character can be considered as names rather than a fixed set  . 
Thus the length of Chinese personal names ranges from  2 to 6 characters . 
3 . 2 Strategies 3 . 2 . 1 Segmentation before Identif ication Input text has to be segmented roughly beforehand  . 
This is because many characters have high probabilities to be a Chinese personal name without pre-segmentation  . Consider the example '~!,)~l ~,@~ l + j(@~l ~ . . . ' . The character ' ( i @' has a high score to be a surname . In this aspect , '~) ~' is easy to be a name . If the input text is not segmented beforehand , it is easy to regard '( q ~ . ~ J ~' as a Chinese personal name . On the statistical model , this type of errors is difficult to avoid . However , it is easy to capture by pre-segmentation . 
3.2.2 Variation of a Character
How to calculate the score of a candidate is an important issue in this identification system  . The paper ( Chang et al , 1992) proposes the following formula : ( I)P ( W , GN ) = P ( GN ) * P ( WIGN ) This formula has a drawback , i . e . , it does not consider the probability of a character to be the other words rather than a surname  . Take the two characters ' , ~ , ~' and ' llil\['as an example . The character ''~ j . ' canform ' ~' ,  '1" , 1/~ ' , 'l " ~/- ii Tfi ' , and many other words . On the contrary , the character ' I@i ' just forms a word '@\[1~' , which is a rare word . 
The difference shows that the former is easier to be used as the other words than the latter  . The above formula assigns the same score to '@/:- ~' and '@\[  ( -~' , when ''0?' and '111~' have the same frequency to be names . Intuitively , ' ~ lj . ~'-' . ' does not look like a name , but ' ItlJU ~ . ' does . Thus't liI ( ' should have higher score than ' ~ l ' , and the variation of a character should be considered in the formula  . In our model , the variation of characters is learned from NTU balanced corpus  . 
3.2.3 Baseline Model
Equation (2) defines the original formula . The formula used to calculate P ( C i ) is similar to Equation ( 1 )  . When the variation of a character is considered , Equation (3) is formulated . The variation of a character is measured by the inverse of the frequency of the character to be the other words  . Equation (4) is simplified from Equation (3) . 
(2 )  1' ( C1 ) xP ( C2 ) xP ( C3 ) 1 l1 ( 3 ) P ( CI ) x--xt ' ( C2 ) x--xP ( C3 ) x-~--&Cl&C2&C3#CI#C2  #C3 ( 4 ) -- x--?--&CI& ( 7 2  &  C3 where C i is a character in the input sentence , P ( C i ) is the probability of Ci to be a surname or a name  ,  #Ci is the frequency of Ci to be a surname or a name  , tile other words . 
For differentypes of surnames , different models are adopted . 
( a ) Single character  #CI  #C2  #C3 ( 5 ) --x--x-->Threxholdl&CI& ( '2 & C3  #C1 ( 6 ) - - -> Thresho M2& ( 71 #  ( _72 #C3 and -- x - -> Threshold 3& ( 72 &  ( 73  ( b ) Two characters  #C2 # (  ; 3  ( 7 ) --?--> Threshold 4& ( 72 & C3 ( c ) Two surnames together  #Cll#C12  #C2  #C3 ( 8 ) ----?--?--?--& CII&C I2  &  C2  &  C3  > "  lhreshold5  #Cll # C12   ( 9 )  - - ? - - >  7hreshoM6  &  C11  &  C12  #  C2  #  C3 and --- x---> 7hreshoM7  &  C2  &  C3 Because the surnames w~th two characters are always surnames  , Model ( b ) neglects the score of surname part . Models ( a ) and ( c ) have two score functions . It avoids the problem of very high score of surnames  . Consider the string'1 ~;' it (") j~J'\[" . 4: J(J ~@ <-" . Because of the high scores of the characters '1~' and ' S , ' , '\[~ N~f' , ' f : , - NI ' , ' t : , ~: J- 2" and ' J ~-~' may be identified according to Equation  ( 5 )  . Equation ( 6 ) screens out the impossible candidates . The above three models can be extended to single -character names  . When a candidate cannot pass the threshold , its last character is cutoff and the remaining part is tried again  . The threshold is different from the original one . Thresholds are trained from Chinese personal name corpus  . We calculate the score of every Chinese personal name in the corpus using the above formulas  . The scores for each formula are sorted and the one which is less than  99% of the personal names is considered as a threshold for this for nmla  . That is , 99% of the training data can pass the threshold . 
3.2.4 Other Clues
Text provides many useful clues from three different levels-say  , character , sentence and paragraph levels . The baseline model forms the first level , i . e . , characterlevel . The following subsections present other clues . Of these , gender is also a clue from characterlevel ; title , mutual information and punctuation marks come from sentence level  ; tile paragraph information is recorded in cache . 
3 . 2 . 4 . 1 Clue1:Title The first is title . Wang et a/ . 
(1992 ) propose a model based on titles When a title appears before  ( after ) a candidate , it is probably a personal name . For example , ' ~ . -~) NI ~,' and '~, ~~) ' ~: ~, ~ . ~\](' However , there are many ~! ~ , ~\[J Thus counterexamples , e . g . , '~''';(~~"-4:~'~~' f'J"s':Y' .  ,  .   , we cannot make sure if the character surrounding a title form a personal name  . Even so , title is still a useful clue . it can help determine the boundary of a name . In the example ' ~ . J  ~ J!~'~; ~; : i-qj . . . ','~- IDJ!SJ'~I ~,'' is identified incorrectly . When a title is included in this example , i . e . , ' ~ JDJ ! ~! I ~', ; I ~' ~; IJ . . . ', the error does not occur . In sumnmry , if a title appears , a special bonus is given to the candidate 3 . 2 . 4 . 2 Clue 2: Mutual hfformation Chinese personal names are not always composed of single characters  . For example , the name part of the sentence ' l ~ i ~ r l ) Jv~Jlai~lc'/ ; ~'r~' ; jt lfj ' is a word . How to tell out that a word is a content word or a name is indispensable  . Mutual information ( Church & Hanks , 1990) provides a measure of word association . The words surrounding a word candidate are checked  . When there exists a strong relationship , the word candidate has high probability to be a content word  . In the example '1~~! J : ~ l'/',~<~Jl ~ ?_~ . ,  . ', the two words " CI !!:" and ' ~ . ~\[tl'have high mutual reformation , so that ' lI ~ , i1~' is not a personal name . Three newspaper corpora ( total size is about 2 . 6 million words ) are used to train the word association . 
3 . 2 . 4 . 3 Clue 3: Punctuation Marks Personal names usually appear at the head or the tail of a sentence  . A candidate is given an extrabonus when it is found from these two places  . Candidates surrounding the caesura mark , a Chinese-specific punctuation mark , are treated in the similar way . If some words around this punctuation are personal names  , the others are given bonus . 
3 . 2 . 4 . 4 Clue 4: Gender There is a special custom in Chinese . A married woman may markher husband'surname before her surname  . That forms type 3 personal name mentioned in Section 3  . 1 , Because a surname may be considered as a name , e . g . , '7/' in the personal name ~'~'/~ Jt ~ and in , ~ , ~ r / , - , v . the candidates with twotile personal name c ~ , ,~ , , possible surnames do not always belong to type 3 personal name . The gender information , i . e . , type 3 is always a female , helps us disambiguate he type of personal names . Some Chinese characters have high score formal e and some for female  . The following lists some typical examples : male : ~   ,   , ~ ,  ~ , " , ~ t  ~ , -1 t ( , ~ j  ~ , J ? J(~ , 9 ~ i , JI ( , ( ~ l , ) ~; female : ~ i ~ , J  ~ , I ~ , ~ ll ,  ~:~ ,  ~; ,  :: , ' ~ L~Y , ) J : , -+-/ male and female , and compare these two scores . If the former is larger than the latter , then it is a masculine name . Otherwise , it is a fenfinine name . 
3 . 2 . 4 . 5 Clue 5: Cache A personal name may appear lnore than once in a paragraph This phenomenon is useful durmg identification We use cache to store the identified candidates  , and reset cache when next paragraph is considered There are four cases shown below when cache is used :  ( a ) CIC2C3 and C1C2C4 are in the cache , and
CIC2 is correct.
(b ) CIC2C3 and C1C2C4 are in the cache , and both are correct . 
(c ) CIC2C3 and C1C2 are in the cache , and
C1C2C3 is correct.
( d ) C1C2C3 and C1C2 are in the cache , and
CIC2 is correct.
Here Ci denotes a Chinese character . It is obvious that case ( a ) contradicts with case ( b )  . Consider the string'5J ~ J!i'i ; ~ , 'J , )-:jl' , ' lif~:'j : ~ l ; ~' . A personal , mum'~!ID \] J ? ;;\[~ , '' is recognized . When another string'<-I~lJl ) ~ . 
~lt/Jxq':?lJI, . ';'_~')'l'lili~ , t ~' is input ,  '~ , ~ l l l l f A ) ~' and ' Tlldx > l ":' are identified Then we find the two strings '/' i  . J ~\] ~) ~, ' and ' +' \] J' . ~; a : ' lY /' resimilar . Here case ( a ) is correct . 
However , case ( b ) also appears very often in newspapers . For example , ' l ~ lL , kT ~" J ~ l ~ J ' gfJ ~ i H ~ hiI ,  ~3 . . . LT wo personal names , ' li\[\]/k : ~'~/ and ' lT\[~\]Kgt ? ' are identified In the examples like ' ~  . ~t ~\[< gif ~" ~ .   .   . ' and ' . . .  ~  . ~ o ', two candidates ' ~ . ~; ~ t ~,' and ''#~' will be identified . That belon ~ to case ( d) . 
Consider the last examples '11', (,1i*l1~,1:< . .' and '~,(, i~l l~g , rii:j . d z . . . ' Two candidates ' ~ , ( ~ i ' and ' ~' , ( , ~" i ~ lI ' will be identified too . Now , case(c ) is adopted . 
in our treatment , a weight is assigned to each entry in the cache . The entry which has clear right boundary has a high weight  . Title and punctuation are chics for boundary . For those similar pairs which have different weights  , the entry having high weight is selected . If both have high weights , both are chosen . When both have low weights , the score of the second character of a name part is critical  . It a etermiues if the character is keptor deleted . 
3.3 Experiments and Discussions
Tablels tunmarlzes the identification results of Chinese personal names  . Total Chinese personal names in each section are listed in Cohlnm  2  . 
Cohmm 3 shows the precision and the recall of the baseline model  . The overall performance is good except for section  4   ( the international section ) and section 5 ( the economic section )  . The remaining colunms demonstrate the change of performance after the clues discussedm Section  3  . 2 are considered incrementally . If name part of a candidate is a word , word association is used to measure the relationship between the surrotmding words  . The increase of the precision in Cohmm 4 verifies this idea . Theoretically , its hottld not decrease the recall . After checking the result , we find that some unreasonable word association comes from the training corpus  . Recall that it is generated by a rough word segmentation system wlthoul manually-checking  . The next clue is punctuation . 
The idea is that the candidates m the beginning or at the end of sentences have larger probabilities to be personal names than they are in other places  . It helps some candidates with lower score to pass the threshold  , but it cannot avoid the incorrect candidates to pass the threshold Thus  , the performance is dangling . Then , title is considered The increase of the recall shows that title works well But it decreases the precision too  . From the variation of the performance , we know that cache is powerful . Both the recall and the precismn increase . 
Finally , gender is joined It is used when two successive characters are candidates of surnames  . 
In other words , it focuses on type 3 personal names . 
Almost all type 3 personal names are identified correctly . Because this type of personal names is rare in the testing newspaper corpus  , the variation is not large . Table 1 shows that our model is good except for section 4 and section 5  . There are many proper nouns in the international section  , and a hnost all of them are not included m the dictionary  . 
All unknown words disturb one another in segmentation  . For example , ' q ! il I?~J ~0,' is a countiy name . It is divided into three single characters by our word segmentation system  . From the viewpoint of personal nmne identification  , it is easy to regard'lI , " r ~ J ~ ff as a Chinese personal name . Another source of errors is foreign names . Some of them are similar to Chinese personal names  , e . g . , '~' ~! Ui/i : ' and ' < t&jE' .

The company name ' ~\] ~\] i ) t ' is a typical example . In summary , there are three major errors . One is foreign name . They are identified as proper nouns correctly , but are assigned wrong features . About 20% of errors belong to this type . The second type of errors results from the rare surnames  , which are not included in the surname table . Somera resurnames are not real surnames . They are just artists'stage names . Near 14% of errors come from this type . The other errors include place names , organization ames , and so on . 
4 . Transliterated Personal Names 4 . 1 Structure of Personal Names Compared with the ideniification of Chinese personal names  , the identification of transliterated personal names has the following difficulties :  ( a ) No specific cluelike surnames in Chinese personal names to trigger the identification system  . 
( b ) No restriction on the length Of a transliterated personal name  . It may be composed of a single character or more , e . g . ,'5%', ' ~' i'\]d',"~'i~Y ',' ~ . f ~':'~-' and ' d\[if , ~ \ ]~1\ ] '  ( c ) No large scale transliterated personal name corpus  . 
( d ) Ambiguity in classification.
For example , ' J  ~ ) ~' may denote a city or a former American president  . 
4.2 Strategies 4.2.1 Basic Idea
Almost all foreign names are in transliteration , ot in translation . And the base of transliteration is pronunciation of foreign names  . Pronunciation is composed of syllables and tones . The major difference of pronunciation between Chinese and English is syllables  . The style of syllabic order is specific in transliteration  . Consider an example . 
The transliterated personal name , ~\] z ~ . has syllables ' Y ~', 7--~ zvT--((~' . Such a syllabic order is rare in Chinese , but is not special for a transliterated string . In other words , the syllabic orders of transliterated strings and general Chinese strings are not similar  . Besides , a transliterated name consists of a string of single characters after segmentation  . That is , these characters cannot be put together . However , the unrestrictive length of transliterated names and homophones in Chinese result in the need of very large training corpus  . The following section show how to modify the basic idea if a largescale corpus is not available  . 
4.2.2 Character Condition
When a foreign name is transliterated , the selection of homophones i restrictive . Consider an example shown below : Richard Macs ~ ll\[~l  ) ~ ~  ,  ~  ,   , ~ Those strings following English names have the same pronunciations  . The first is usually adopted , and the second is never used . It shows that the characters used in transliteration are selected from some character set  . In our model , total 483 characters are trained from our transliterated personal name corpus  . They play the similar role of the surnames in the identification of Chinese personal names  . If all the characters in a string belong to this set  , i . e . , they satisfy character condition , they are regarded as a candidate . 
4.2.3 Syllable Condition
Because of the unrestrictive lngth of transliterated names  , how to identify their boundary is a problem . 
Of course , titles and punctuation used in last section can be adopted too  . But they do not always appear in the text . Thus another clue should be found . 
Syllable order may be a clue . Those examples like ' ~ r ~' , ' ~' J ,   , ' and ' ~' which meet the character condition do not look like transliterated names because their pronunciations are not like foreign names  . If there is a large enough transliterated name corpus  , the syllable orders can be learned . 
However , our transliterated corpus only contain 2692 personal names . Thus only the first and the last characters are considered  . For each candidate , we check the syllable of the first ( the last ) character . 
If the syllable does not belong to the training corpus  , the character is deleted . The remaining characters are treated in the similar way  . 
4.2, 4 Frequency Condition
As mentioned in Section 3 . 2 . 3 , the frequency of a character to be a part of a personal name is important information  . The concept may be used here . However , only largescale transliterated personal name corpus can give reliable statistical data  . Based on our small training corpus , the range of the application of the information should be narrowed own  . We only apply it in a candidate of length 2 . This is because it is easy to satisfy the character condition for candidates of the shortest length  . For each candidate which has only two characters , we compute the frequency of these two characters to see if it is larger than a threshold  . If it is not , it is eliminated . The threshold is determined in the similar way as Section  3  . 2 . 3 . 
4.3 Experiments and Discussions
The identification systems cans a segnlented sentence from left to right  . It finds the character string that meets the character condition  , syllable condition and frequency condition . Table 2 shows Total Names System Correct Error Lose Recall

However , sections 2 and 5 ( lhesocial and the economic sections ) have bad precision . The average recall tells us that the tri , g~ger to the identification system is nsefnl . The reasons why the recall is not good enough are : some transliterated personal names  ( e . g . , '? , ~Oi ~' j ~' and ' ~ D$~' ) look like Chinese personal names , and the identification of Chinese personal names is done before that of transliterated personal names  . 
Although they are correctly identified as personal names  , they are assigned wrong features . Similarly , transliterated nouns like popular brands of automobiles  ( '7\[~\[!~ , ' i : ' and " l\[~ , ) l~~j') , Chinese proper nouns (' ~ I\]~''~ . J : x ) ~' and '? t'~II ~' ) and Chinese personal names ( ' ~ I : ~ l\]' ) look like transliterated personal nmnes . That decreases the precision . 
f ~ esides these types of nouns , boundary errors affect the precision 1 oo . For telling out the error rates from classification  , we made another experiment . If the identified results are not classified , the average precision is 81 . 46% and the average recall is 91 . 22% . 
5 . Organization Names 5 . 1 Structures of Organization Names Structures of organization ames are more complex than those of personal names  . Some organization names are composed of proper nouns and content r~-ILIII~H  , Jismade up of words . For exmnple , ' ~"'"" ~:' the place name'T '? ; \[\[ ; fii ' and the content word ' ~ t ~' , J-' . 
A personal nmne can also be combined a content word to form an organizatio name  , e . g . , '~ t , 7~ lI~1~i ~\[ ii ~ PJi' . Some organization names look like personal names , e . g . , '\[ j\[~)t ' . Some organization names are composed of several related words  . For example , '7 ~ II ~ ~ ~ ~ " b ~ i ,  3 , ~~~' contains four words %'~11~' , ' ~' c':' , ' ~' and '3 , ~ '  . Several single-character words can also form an organization name  , e . g . , ' JWtJ ~ ii ~ ~' . Some organization names have nested structures . 
Consider the string : ' ~ l " ~ , ~7; ~ lIfi ~ ~? ~ , ~ ?  , i ~/ J~?\[t' . The group ' ~ iJ ~/ J\~\[l'is a part of the committee  , x  ~ . ~ . ~ q- ,   , and the committee itself is a part of ' ~ I ; ~3~i~II~ , ;5' . Such complex structures make identification of organization names very difficult  . 
Basically , a complete organization ame can be divided into two parts : name and keyword  . In the '-~" l'i'':'il-I\[~rtl is a name , and '1l ~ example ii-IlI~f:~f'l , "~"'"/ I~J :' is a keyword . Many words can serve as names , but only some fixed words can be regarded as keywords  . Thus , keywordix an important clue to identify the organizations  . However , there are still several difficult problems . First , keyword is usually a common content word . It is not easy to tell out a keyword and a content word  . Second , a keyword may appearm the abbreviated form . For exmnple , ' . \] ~ i ~ i ' x an incomplete keyword of ' ? ~ : ~ i ? ill ~ l  ~  , r \]' . 
Third , the keyword may be omitted completely . For example , '~_~), ~' ( Acer) . The following shows two rough classifications , and discusses their feattues . 
( l ) Complete organization ames ( a ) Structure : This type of organization names is usually composed of proper nouns and keywords  . 
( b ) Length : Some organization names are very long , so it is hard to decide their length . 
Fortunately , only some keyword like ' liil ~ J . ~" ,  ' ~ ~'  ,  '3 , ~ , ~ , :~' ,  '~\[\[ , ~I ~' , midso on , have this problem . 
( c ) Ambiguity : Some organization names with keywords are still mn biguous  . For exmnple , ' Xl " ~( ~ ii , ~: , ' and '1\[~ ,  '~ '  . They usually denote reading matters , but not organizations . However , if they are used in some contexts , e . g . , "~ l"~f::il ;~ , ~~~ f!J3t\["and"l\[~ , ~ ~\ [ ~( l ~( ~ lf ) ~" , they should be interpreted as organizations . 
(2 ) Incomplete organization ames ( a ) Structure : These organization names often omit their keywords  . 
( b ) Ambiguity : The abbreviated organization names may be ambiguous  . For example , '~ t !, ~($', '~~ ~', ', ~, . , ~!~' and '/~'/" .   .   . L-are famous sport teams m Taiwm ~ or in U . S . A . , however , they are also general content words . 
5.2 Strategies
This section introduce some strategies used in the identification  . Keyword is a good indicator for an identification system  . It plays the similar role of surnames . Keyword shows not only the possibility System Correct Error ILose Precision Recall

For each sentence , we scan it from left to right to find keywords . Because keyword is a general content word , we need other strategies to tell out its exact meaning  . These strategies also have the capabilities to detect the left boundary if there is an organization ame  . 
Prefix is a good marker for possible left boundary  . For example ,  '\[ , ,~ I~Z ' ( National ) , ' ~( ~ qL ' ( Provincial ) , ' ~\] ~ qi ? ( Private ) , and so on . The name part of an organization may be for lned by single characters or words  . These two cases are discussed as follows . 
( a ) single characters
After segmentation , theren my be a sequence of single characters preceding a possible keyword The character may exist independently  . That is , it is a single-character word . In this case , the content word is not a keyword , so that no organization ame is found If these characters cannot exist independently  , they form the name part of an organization . The left boundary of the organization is determined by the following rule : We insert a single character to the name part until a word is met  . 
( b ) word(s )
Here , a word is composed of at least two characters . If the word preceding the possible keyword is a place name or a personal name  , then the wordforms the name part of an organization  . 
Otherwise , we use word association model to determine the left boundary  . The postulation is : the words to compose a name part usually have strong relationships  . The mutual information mentioned in Section 3 . 2 . 4 . 2 is also used to measure the relationship of two words  . 
Part of speech is useful to determine the left boundary of an organization  . The categories of verbs are very typical . The name part of an organization cannot extend beyond a transitive verb  . 
If a transitive verb precedes a possible keyword , then no organization ame is found . Numeral and classifier are also helpful . For exan ~ ple , ' ~ HJ ' ( company ) in ' ~ fJ .   .   . ' ( three companies . . . ) is not a keyword due to the critical parts of speech  . 
Because a tagger is not involved before identification  , the part of speech of a word is determined wholly by lexical probability  . 
5.3 Experiments and Discussions
Table 3 shows the precision and the recall for every section  . Section 4 ( The International Section ) has better precision and recall than other files . Most errors result from organization names without keywords  , e . g . , ' , ~ , = ~ fijL ~''~+ I(6' , /\ : L~I ~ : ~! ~ I , JL  ~ J , and so on . Even keywords appear , e . g . , ' \ [ - r i J~r fJ ' and '~ r ~ fi : ~-~' , there may not always exist organization names . Besides error candidates and organization names without keywords  , error left boundary is also a problem . Consider the exaln ples:'~\['; ~\['-'~! ~ . :), t ~' and f~-~' . In the first , ' ~ qS ) ' should not be included : and in the second , a word'3 , ~'~' is lost . 
6. Applications
The senmnticlassification of proper nouns is use fill in many applications  . Here , anaphora resolution and sentence aligmnent are presented  . In general , pronoun often refers to the nearest proper noun ( Chen ,  1992) . But it is not always true . The following shows a counterexample : The first pronoun  '1"1f  ~'  ( tie ) refers to the personal name '- ( ~ , ~' . It is a normal example . The second pronoun ' ~' ( he ) refers to the same person , but the ' ~'~''; i ; ~ . ~!' . nearest personal name is ? ~ j - ~ rather than If we know the gender of every personal name  , then it is easy to tell out which person is referred  , in the above example , the gender of the Chinese pronouns ' ~\[~' ( he ) and '/ t\[\[~' ( she ) is masculine and feminine , respectively ; timpers on s':~'17:~' and ' . 1:~'~-~'~'!'~':;'a , ~42~1' J\] , -5 ? S are nmle and female , respectively . Therefore , the correct referential relationships can be well -established  . In the experiment of the gender assignment ,   3/4 of Chinese personal name corpus is regarded as training data  , and the renmining l/4 is for testing . The correct rate is 89% . Sentence alignment ( Chen & Chen , 1994) is important in important clues . Its use in aligning EnglishChinese text is shown in the paper  ( Chen & Wu ,  1995\] . 
7, Concluding Remarks
This paper proposes various strategies to identify and classify Chinese proper nouns  . The perfornmnce evahmtion criterion is very strict Not only are the proper nouns identified  , but also suitable features are assigned . The perforlnance ( precision , recall ) for the identification of Chinese personal names , transliterated personal nmnes and organization mnesis  ( 88 . 04%, 92 . 56%), (50 . 62%, 71 . 93%) and (61 . 79%, 54 . 50%), respectively . 
When the criterion is loosed a little , i . e . , Chinese personal nmnes and transliterated personal names are regarded as a category  , the performance ~ s (81 . 46%, 91 . 22%) . Compared with the approaches ( Sproat et al , 1994: Fung & Wu , 1994: Wang et al ,  1994) , we deal with more types of proper nouns and we have better performance  . 
Some difficult problem should be tackled in the flml re  . Foreign proper nouns may be transformed in part by transliteration ad translation  . The example " George Town " is transformed into ' :~'~   J4~'  . The character ' b ~' ( town ) results in translation and ' fq : ? ( (  ( George ) comes from transliteration . Tlus problem is interesting and worthy of resolving  . The performance of identification of organization a mesms not good enough  , especially for those organization names without keywords  . It should be investigated further .
