1. Introductory Renmrks
E TAP-3 is a multilm rpos cNIA ~ environmmlt that was conceived in the  1980s and has been worked out in the Institute for lnl ~mnation Transmission Problems  , Russian Academy of Sciences ( Apresian et al 1992 , l ? , oguslavsky 1995) . The theoretical foundation of ETAP-3 is tile Meaning ? => Text linguistic theory by Igor '  Mel'6uk and the Integral Theory of Language by
Jurij Apresian.
E q'AP-3 is a non-comlner cial environment primarily oriented at linguistic research rather than creating a marke table software product  . The main focus of the research carried ( ) tit with I' ; T AP-3 is COln putational modelling of natural languages . This attitude explains our effort to develop the models in a way as linguistically sound as possible  . We strive to incorporate into the system much linguistic knowledge irrespective of whether this knowledge is essential for better text processing  ( e . g . machine translation ) or not . In particular , we want our parser to produce what wc consider a correct syntactic representation of tim sentence -first of all because we believe that this interpretation is a true fact about tile natural language  . We have had in any occasions to set that in the long run the iheorctical soundness and completeness of linguistic knowledge incorporated in an NIA  ) application will pay . 
All NLP applications in F ,   TAP-3 are largely based on an original system of three -w due logic and use an original formal language of linguistic descriptions  , I ~' Oi > & ; T .

Section 3.
2.1.1. ETAP-3 MT System
The most important module of ETAP-3 is the MT system that serves five language pairs :   ( 1 ) English-Russian , (2) Russian-English , (3) Russian-Korean . (4) Russian-French , and (5)
Russian-German.
By far the most advanced are the first two of these pairs  . The system disposes of 50 , 0 00-strong socalled combinatorial dictionaries of Russian and English that contain syntactic  , derivational , semantic , subcategorization , and collocational information . The system relies on comprehensive grammars of the two languages  . 
For the other language pairs smaller scale prototypes are available  . 
E TAP-3 is able to present multiple translations when it encounters an ambiguity it cannot resolve  . By default , the system produces one parse and one translation that it considers the most probable  . If the user opts for multiple translation , the system remembers the unresolved ambiguities and provides all mutuany compatible parses and lexical choices  . 
To give one example from the real output : the sentence They made a general remark that  .   .   .   . 
when submitted to the multiple translation option , yielded two Russian translations that correspond to radically different syntactic structures and lexical interpretations :  ( a ) On is delaliob shcheez a meehanie , ch to . . . ( = They made some comn-lonren lark that . . . ) and ( b ) Onivy nudili general aot metit ; ch to . . . ( = They forced some general to remark that . . . ) . 
2.1.2. Natural Language Interface to SQL Type

This ETAP-3 module translates freely word ed human queries to a database from Russian or English into SQL expressions  . It can also produce the reverse generation of a NL query from an SQL expression  . 
2.1.3. System of Synonymous Paraphrasing
The module is designed for linguistic experiments in obtaining nmltiple meaning-retaining paraphrases of Russian and English sentences  . The paraphrasing is based on the concept of lexical functions  , one of the important innovations of the Meaning ? => Text theory  . The following example shows the kind of paraphrases that can be produced by the module :   ( 1 ) The director ordered John to write a report-The director gave John an order to write a report- John was ordered by the director to write a report-John received an orcler fonn the director to write a report  . 
It is a very promising direction of linguistic research and develop lnent that can be applied in a wide range of activities  , including language learning and acquisition , authoring , and text planning . Besides that , lexical functions are used for ensuring adequate lexical choice in machine translation and in the UNL module  . 
2.1.4. Syntactic Error Correction Tool
The module operates with Russian texts in which it finds a wide range of errors in grammatical agreement as well as case subcategorization ad offers the user the correct version  . 
2.1.5. Computer-Aided Language Learning Tool
The module is a standalone software application constructed as a dialogue type computer galne intended for advanced students of Russian  , English , and German as foreign languages who wish to enrich their vocabulary  , especially to master the collocations of these natural languages and their periphrastic abilities  . 
The tool relies on the apparatus of lexical limctions  . It can also be used native speakers of the three languages interested in increasing their command of the vocabulary  ( such as journalists , school teachers , or politicians ) . 
2.1.6. TreeBank Workbench
This is the module that utilizes the ETAP-3 dictionaries , its morphological analyzer and the parser to produce a first-ever syntactically tagged corpus of Russian texts  . It is a mixed type application that combines automatic parsing with human postediting of tree structure  . 
2.2. Major Features
The following ate the most important features of the whole  ETAP-3 environment and its modules : * Rule-Based Approach ? Stratificational Approach ? Transfer Approach ? Syntactic Dependencies ? Lexicalistic Approach ? Multiple Translation ? Maximum Reusabilty of Linguistic Resources modules that process NLs enteuces are strictly rule-based  . However , illaseries of recent experiments , tile MT module was supplen lenled by all example -based component of a translation menlory type and a statistical component hat provides semiautonmtic extraction of translatiou equivalents t ? ombilingual text corpora  ( see lomd in & Streiter 1999 )  . 
E TAP-3 shares its stratificational feature with many other NLP systems  . It is attile level of tile normalized , or deep syntactic , structure that tile transfer flom tile source to tile target language takes place in MT  . 
E TAP-3 makes use of syntactic dependency trees for sentence structure representation instead of constituent  , or phrase , structure . 
Tile ETAP-3 system takes a lexicalistic standilltile sense that lexical data are considmed as important as gl ' ammar infornlation  . A dictionary entry contains , in addition to tile lemma name , information on syntactic and semantic features of tile word  , its subcategorization flame , a default translation , and rules of various types , and w dues of lexical functions for which tile lemma is tile keyword  . 
The word's syntactic t'eatures characterize its ability/nou-ability to participate ill specific syntactic onstructions  . A word can have several syntactic features elected from a total of more than  200 items . Semantic features arc needed to checktile semantic agreement between the words illa sentence  . Tile sube a tegorization frame shows the surface marking of tile word's arguments  ( in terms of case , prepositions , conjtmctions , etc . ) . Rules are an essential part of the dictionary entry  . All the rules operating in ETAP-3 are distributed betwecn tile granmmr and tile dictionary  . Grammar rules memore general and apply lolarge classes of words  , whereastile rules listed or simply referred to in the dictionary are restricted ill their scope and only apply to small classes of words or even individual words  . This organization of tile rules ensures the self -tuning of tile system totile processing of each particulars enteuce  . In processing a sentence , only those dictionary rules are actiwlted that are explicitly referred to ill the dictionary entries of tile words making uptile sentence  . A sample dictionary enlry fl ' agment for tile English noun chance illustrates what was said above:  \[1\]   CHANCE1   \[21 POR : S \[3\] SYNT:COUNT , PREDTO , PREDTHAT\[4\]DES : ' FACT' , ' ABSTRACT'\[5\]D1 . 1: OF , ' PERSON'\[6\]D 2 . 1:OF,'FACT'\[7\]D2 . 2: TO2\[8\]D2 . 3 :THAT1   \[9\] SYN 1 : OPPORTUNITY \[10\] MAGN:GOOD 1~FAIR   1~EXCELLENT   \[11\] ANTIMAGN : SLIGHT/SLIM/POOR/LITTLE1/

To give a general idea of how the ETAP-3 NLP operates , we show here the layout of the MT module ( Fig . I ) . In a way , all the other modules can be viewed as this module's deriwttives  .

The environment has a number of auxiliary tools , including a sophisticated lexicographer's toolkit that allows the developers and the users to effectively maintain and update the  ETAP-3 dictionaries . 
3 . The UNL Interface 3 . 1 Aims and scenario The UNL project has a very ambitious goal : to break down or at least to drastically lower the language barrier for the Internet users  . With time and space limitations already overcome , the Internet community is still separated by language boundaries  . Theoretically , this seems to be the only major obstacles tanding in the way of international and interpersonal communication it he information society  . This is why the problem of the language barrier on the Interact is perceived as one of the global problems of mank in d  , and a project aiming to solve this problem has been initiated under the UN auspices-by the Institute of Advanced Studies of the United Nations University  . 
Started in 1996 , the project curremly embraces 15 universities and research institutions fiom Brazil  , China , Egypt , France , Germany , India , Indonesia , Italy , Japan , Jordan , Latvia , Mongolia , Russia , Spain , and Thailand . 
In the following years more groups are expected to join  , so that in the long run all languages of the UN member states will be covered  . 
The idea of the project is as follows . An interlingua has been developed which has sufficient expressive power to represent relevant information conveyed by natural languages  . This interlinguaent it led Universal
Networking Language ( UNL ) has been proposed by H . Uchida ( UNU/IAS) . For each natural language , two systems should be developed : a " de converter "capable of translating texts from UNL to this NL  , and an " enconverter " which has to convert NL texts procedure of producing a UNL text ix not supposed to be fully autolnatic  . It will be an interactive process with the labor divided between the COln puter and a human expert  ( " writer " ) in UNI+ . 
This paradigm makes UNL radically different from conventional machine lranslation  . 
Duo to the interactive on coil version , the UNL expression , which serves as in pul for generation , can benlado as good as Cliowishes . The UNL writer will edit the rough result proposed by the Oll Convorlor  , corfect its errors , eliminate there nlaining ambiguities . He/she can run a deconvorior of his own language to lest the wtlidity of the UNL expression obtained alld then refine it againt in one is fully satisfied with the l'inal result  .

3.2 UNL language
We cannot describe the UNL language here in all details : this topic deserves a special paper which will hopefully be written by the author of the language design-l  ) r . Hiroshi Uchida . We will only characterize it to the extent necessary for the description of our deconversion module  . 
Full specification of UNL can be found at/lllp:/ /WWW  . tml . tax . t tnu . edu / . 
UNL is a comlmter language intended to represent infolmation in a way that allows to generate a text expressing this information in a very large number of nahtralanguages  . AUNL expression is an oriented hypergraph that corresponds to a NL sentence in the amount of information conveyed  . The arcs of t11o graph are interpreted as senmntic relations of the type agent  , ob . ject , lime , place , inslrttment , manlier , etc . The nodes of the graph are special units , the socalled Universal Words ( UW ) interpreted as concepts , or groups of UWs . The nodes can be supplied with attributes which provide additional information on their use in lh c given sentence  , e . g . @ imperative , @ generic , @ future , @ obligation . 
Each UW is represented as ant ~ , nglish word that can be optionally supplied with semantic specifications to restrict its meaning  . 
In most cases , these specifications locate the concept in the knowledge base  . It is done in the following way : UWA ( i c l > B ) ix interpreted as ' A is subsumed under the category B '  . For example , the UW coach used without any restrictions denotes anything the English coach can denote  , ll ' eric wants to be more precise , one can use restrictions : coach ( icl>transl ) or t ) denotes abus , coaclz ( icl > lmman ) denotes a trainer and coach ( icl > do ) denotes the action of training , in a sense , the apparatus of restrictions allows to represent UWs as disambiguated l'  ; nglish words . Onltle other hand , restrictions allow to denote concepts which are absent in I ~  ; nglish . For cxmnple , in Russian there is a large group of motion words  , whose meaning incorporates the idea of the mode of locomotion or tral/s portation : priletel '' come by flying '  , prO@ , /'' come by ship ' , l ) ril ) ol zti ' come by crawling ' , l ) ril ) eJlal ' ' come running ' , elc . 
l!nglish has no neutral words to denote these concepts  . Still , on the basis of English one can constrttct lJWs that approximate required concepts  , e . g . conw ( met > shil )   ) is interpreted as ' come and the method o1' comingix aship ' . 
II ere is an example of a UNL expression for the sentence  ( 2 ) Howevel , hm gua , q , edll/ferences are a barrier to the smoot/L/low of in  . fomnation in our society . 
l' ; ach line is an expression of the kind rehttion ( UW l , UW2) . For simplicity , UWs are not supplied with restrictions .

Attributes : @ entry-denotes the top node of the structure  , @ present-presentense , @ def-definite NP , @ pl-plural , @ however-a modal meaning corresponding to English however  . 
3 . 3 . UNL-Russian dee on version by means of ETAP-3 As was shown in Section 1  ,   ETAP-3 is a transfer-based system where the transfer is carried out at the level of the Normalized Syntactic Structure  ( Norm SS )  . This level is best suited for establishing correspondence with UNL  , as UNL expressions and Norm SS show striking similarities  . The most important of the lnare as follows : 1 . Both UNL expressions and Norm SSs occupy an intermediate position between the surface and the semantic levels of representation  . They roughly correspond to the socalled deep -syntactic level  . At this level the meaning of the lexical items is not decomposed into the primitives  , and the relations between the lexical items are language independent  ;  2 . The nodes of both UNL expressions and NormSSs are terminal elements  ( lexical items ) and not syntactic ategories ;  3 . The nodes carry additional characteristics ( attributes )  ;  4 . The arcs of both structures are non-symmetrical dependencies  . 
At the same time , UNL expressions and
Norm SSs differ in several important respects : 1 . All the nodes of NormSSs are lexical items , while a node of a UNL expression can be a subgraph  ;  2 . Nodes of a Norm SS always correspond to one word sense  , while UWs may either be broader or narrower than the corresponding English words :  2  . 1 . they can cover a meaning area that corresponds to several different word senses at a time  ( see above )  ;  2 . 2 . they can correspond to a fi'ee word combination ( e . g . computer-based or high-quality ); 2 . 3 . they can correspond to a word form ( e . g . best which a form of good or well ); 2 . 4 . they can denote a concept that has no direct correspondence in English  ( see above )  . 
3 . A Norm SS is the simplest of all connected graphs -atree  , while a UNL expression is a hypergraph . Its arcs may form a loop and connect subgraphs ;  4 . The relations between the nodes in a Norm SS are purely syntactic and are not supposed to convey a meaning of their own  , while the UNL relations denote semantic roles ; 5 . Attributes of a NormSS mostly correspond to grammatical elements  , while UNL attributes often convey a meaning that is expressed both in English and in Russian by means of lexical items  ( e . g . modals ); 6 . A Norm SS contains information on the word order , while a UNL expression does not say anything to this effect  . 
The Norm SS of tile sentence ( 2 ) looks as follows : be , present
I ~' prcdic "" , ik however difference , pl barrier , i , l~t~lcompos~l-comptflow , deflanvuave/I\attribll\]~-Colnp\]~smooth information in prepos ~ society 
Fig . 2 modif ~ our
As UNL makes use of English lexical labels , it is expedient to bridge the gap between UNL and Russian via English Norm SS which actually serves as an Intermediate Representation  ( IR )  . 
in this case tile UNL-Russian interface will be the simplest  . After the English Norm SS has been reached , conventional ETAP English-to-Russian machine translation mode of operation can be used  . 
The UNL-to-Russian module carries out the following three steps :  1  . Transfer from UNL to the intermediate representation  ( IR )  . 
88 2 . Transfer fronltile IR totile Russian il Ollnalized syntactic structure  ( Norl riSS-1 ) @ 3 . (\] eneration of a P , ussian sentence from the

Tilearchilecture of tile UNL-Russian deconverter is shown in Fig  .  3 . 
It follows fi'om tile previous discussion that the UNL-Norm SS interface should solve the following five tasks :  1  . An appropriate English lexeme for every UW should be selected where it is possible  ; a Russian lexeme will be provided by tile ETAP English-Russian transfer dictionary  . 
If no appropriate English word can be found for a UW  , other means of expression should be found . 
2 . UNL syntactic relations should betl-anslated , either by means of I~q'AP relations or widltile help of lexical items  . 
3 . UNL attribute should be translated , either by lneaus of granunatical features or with the help of lexical items  ( e . g . @ however-however ) . 
4. UNL graph should be converted in a tree.
5. Word order should be established.
The first aild ( parlly ) the second tasks are so h , ed by uleaus Of the infornlatiou stored in the
UW English and English conlbinal orial dictionaries  . Alllherest ( tasks 2io5 ) is done by the rules written in the logical-based I ~' OP  , tZT formalism . 
Let us give one example loil hlstrate the transformation fUNL relations into NL words  . 
UNL has a tim relation that holds between an event and its linle  . As is known , lhech oice of approl ) riaie words to express lhis relation is to a largo oxleni doterilliried by lexical properties of tile word denoting tilne  ; cf . oz . _It Moll ( lay , at midnight , id Alsumme #; rhtri , e  ~ the it , at ; etc . In ETAP-3 all these cases are treated a stile lexical function LOC denoting  ( tenlporal ) locality ( on lexical functions see 2 . 1 . 3) . Tile values of all lexical fimctions are given in the lexicon in the entries of their arguments  ( ee an example in 2 . 2 above ) . While processing tile UNL expression , the tim relation is linked to the lexical ftluclioll LOC which allows to l'iud a correct preposition  , both in English and in Russian . 
3 . 4 . Current state and prospects for the future Tile module of Russian deconversiou is operational and can be tested at cccctrcct cre

Assllo , vnill Fig .  3 , the interface botweou UNL and Russian is established attile level of the English Norll S    . At this point ETAP English-to-Russian n lachine I ranslation facility can be switched which carries throughtile phases of transfer and Russian generation  . This architecture allows to obtain English generalion for relatively cheap  , as ETAP has a Russia u-to-English mode of operation as well  . First experiments in this direction have been carried 
Otll which proved quite promising.
