Most Natural Language Processing systems use a sequential architecture m-bodying classical linguistic layers  . When one works with a general anguage and not a sublanguage  , there are different cases of ambiguities at difterent classical levels  ; and more particularly when one works on CO ml ) lexlanguage t ) he nom-ena analysis ( coordination , ellipsis , negation . . . ) it is ditfic . ulto take into account all the differentypes of these constructions with a general grammar  . Indeed , the inconvenience of this approach is the possible risk of a combinatory explosion  . 
So , we have defined the TALISMAN architecture that includes linguistic agents that corrost  ) on deither to classical ev-els in linguistics ( mor I ) hology , syntax , semantic ) or to coml ) lexlanguage phcnoln-ena analysis . 
1 Introduction
Tile goal of this paper is to show that complex linguistic phenomena like coordination  , ellipsis or negation , call be defined and processed in an distributed architecture  . Intile processing of a very large corpus , the problem is to find an ap-t ) roach allowing tile best interaction between different knowledge levels  ( morphological , syntactic , semantic . . . ) in order to reduce the generation of tile ambiguities  , that occur within any general system of sequential analysis  . 
Most NLP systems use a sequential architecture embodying classical linguistic layers  . Among them one can find systems for English analysis such as ASK\[Thomson  85\]  , LOQUI\[Binol , & al85\] , TEAM\[Pereira 85\] and for Prench analysis such as SAPHIR\[Erli 87\] or LEADER\[Benoit & el .  86\] . Duetol ; he necessity for cooperation between differents modules  , we have turned ourselves to the technics of multi -agents systems fortile construction of TALISMAN architecture\[Ste-fanini  93\]  . This system also uses linguistic models of the CRISTAL system\[  MMI2   89\]  . Tile TAMS-MAN architecture includes linguistic agents that correspond either to classical evels in linguistics  ( morphology , syntax , semantic ) or to complex language phenomena analysis ( coordination , ellipsis , negation . . . ) . 
2 Ambiguities in text analysis 2 . 1 Examples of ambiguities at different levels in the CRISTAL system : In NLP  , when on (' , works with a general language and not a sublanguage  , there are different cases of ambiguities at different classical levels  . 
Preprocessing : the characters are standardized and tile text is cut  ; into for lns . So , tilelmnctua-lions can be ambiguous . For example , a flll stop ( : all indicate an abbreviation or the end of the sentence  . M . Clavier ( prot ) cr noun/common noun ) Morphology : the text for lns are processed individually by the morphological naly ser\[Aho & Corasick  1975\] that attributes one or more interpretations to each in terms of a pair  ( lexical entry , category ) . 
One of the difficulties is to find tile verb in tile homonymous sequence with D/Y  ( determi-nant/preverbal ) F/V ( noun/verb )  . It is possible to predict either the beginning of a noun phrase  ( SN ) or a verbal phrase ( SV )  . 
Exalnple : Pilots ( l ) like ( 2 ) flying ( 3 ) planes ( 1 ) can ( 1 ) be dangerous . 
(1) Pilots , planes , can are either be verbs ( topilot/top lane ) or nouns ( a pilot/at ) lane/a ( : all of bee , -) ( v/F ) . 
(2 ) like is either a verb ( to like ) or a preposition ( like )   ( V/P )  . The cooperation between agents in the Talisman system is detailled in \[ Koning & al  9q  . 
Syntax : A general grammar has rules which interfere with other rules  . For example : N "-> N " N " en at ) lest otmilt N " resulting fi'om the concatenation of two N  ( noun or adjective ) " . This rule allows to construct he juxtaposition of noun phrases  . Example : Lelyee Louis ( F(nom , ppr ) Le Grand . But this rule also is applied in tile following example : On associeh\[chaquegtudiant\]SN Semantics : there are notions of ambiguity and paraphrase  . The inodals can be paraphrased in a variety of ways  . Example : he may come/it's possible that he comes/will come/I per-mit/authorize/empower him to come  . 
2.2 Disambiguisation methods
An ambiguity appears when several solutions are possible for the same problem  . These ambiguities are produced by a module or are the consequence of different analysis modules  . 
2 . 2 . 1 Local grammars for disambiguisation : We advocate the use of local grammars for some disambiguisation fseveral solutions produced by a module  . For example , we can use contextual laws for some morphological disambiguisation  . Indeed , the following laws are always valid for written fi'ench analysis : - Law  1: Determiner + ( Noun or Verb ) > De-terminer ( D ) + Noun ( F ) 
English example : " the address . . . "- Law 2: Pronoun + ( Noun or Verb ) > Pro-noun ( Y ) + Verb ( V ) 
English example : " I address ..."
These laws can be viewed as partial sohttions for combinatory explosion  . 
2 . 2 . 2 Interactions for disambiguisation : In some cases  , the interactions between different modules allow a faster disa Inbiguisation  . Indeed , an agent can use tile knowledge of another agent when needed  . 
For example , during the morphological nd syntactical analysis of the sentence " I  ( Y ) want ( V ) the ( D ) c-mail ( F ) address ( For " V ) " , interactions between MORPH and SYNT are useful . MORPH will send all the sure morphological informations to SYNT  ; MORPH will propose tile two morphological interpretations for " address "  . SYNT will immediatly reject the " address "= Verb solution in this sentence  , thanks to its knowledges . 
In other cases , cooperation between agents is needed when two agents produce different solutions for the same problem  . For example , the form and can be viewed as a syntagm coordinator or as a proposition coordinator  . 
3 Distributed approach for
Natural Language Processing
Blackboards have been applied in linguistics to Speech Understanding Systems \ [ Erman  80\] and more recently to the analysis of written French  ( HELENE\[Zweigenbaum89\] , CARAMEL\[Sabah90\] ) and documentary research\[Mekaouche 91\] . 
The global control of these systems is fully cen -tralized : the distribution of the reasoning capabilities enforces the maintenance of a global representation that is c  . oherent and thus requires the use of belief revision mechanisms  . Architectures based on direct communication between agents allow complete distribution of both knowledge control and distribution of partial results  . 
We will briefly report , on the agent and on agent ; society concepts as they are defined in \[ Stefanini  93\]  . A linguistic agent ; can be divided into two main parts : its knowledge representation adits knowledge processing  . Knowledge and goals can be given or acquired through coInmunication with other agents  . 
At present , the society in the TALISMAN application is represented by the following linguistic agents : PRET for preprocessing  , MORPH for morphological analysis , SEGM for splitting into clauses \[ Maegaard & Spang Hanssen  78\]  , SYNT for syntactic analysis , TRANSF for transformations of utterances ( interrogatives , imperatives , etc . . . ) in declarative clauses , COORD for coordinations , NEGA for negations and ELLIP for ellipses . These agents arc describe . d in detail siil\[Stefanini93\] . There are differentypes of decomposition : Knowledge decomposition by abstraction  ( PRET , MORPH , SEGM , SYNT . . . ) , task decomposition by type of input ( COORD , NEGA ) , task decomposition by type of output ( ELLIP ) . 
Tile TALISMAN system is based on direct con > munication between agents and thus uses mail -boxes for sending messages with an asynchronous mode of communication  . Speech acts \[ Searle 69\] are usually used to comnmnieate in a MultiAgent System  . Intentions of the sender are expressed in a commoneomnmnication language  . The possibh ; interactions between agents during a conversation have to be regulated  , this is clone by means of interaction protocols . 
In the TALISMAN system , tile communication language and the interaction protocols are based on the work of Sian\[Sian  90\]  . 
3.1 Messages
In the systet n , an agent willing to send a message will use the following message format :  ( ( sender , receiver(s )) , ( performative , for (:(;) , content ) . 
Tile name of tiles ending agent enhances the message understanding and the answer  . The sender should determine the addressee agent ( s ) with the help of its knowledge about the other agents  ; if he has none , he will send the message to every agent in tile system  . 
The performative of the message is either a simple sending information  , are quest or a reply . 
However , these types of messages do not suffice to express all tile intentions agents may have  . We oped by SadSian because it is adapted to the eomlnulfication neet ts of the system  . This communication language figures out 9 forces : propose , modify , assert , agree , disagree , no opinion , confirm , accept and withdraw . 
We will not use the force . " accept " that requires the agreement of every agents  . We also did not use the forces " agreed " and " disagreed " because our agents only have reliable information  .

Ri : is the information requestiat which the agents have to answer  . 
Ii : is the informations ending i.
In fact , this is an example of a possible development of the interaction protocols by the agents concerned by the coordination phenomena  . But the use of pseudo-parallelism and a synchronous sending of messages can provide different sending of messages  . 
5 Conclusion
In this paper , we have proposed a method to solve some ambiguities and some complex linguistic phenomena in a TALISMAN MultiAgent System  . To allow cooperation and resolution of conflicts , we have developed interaction protocols adapted to the needs of a natural anguage processing system for written french  . These interaction protocols allow cooperation and resolution of conflicts that appear at one time in the system  , particularly during complex linguistic phenomena treatment  . 
Currently , we are integrating the prototype linguistic agents  ( which implement different types of coordination , egation and ellipsis ) in order to validate the developed protocols . The implementation is realized with Prolog II+ on an IBM Work-station  . After the implementation , we will be able to evaluate and possibly refine the cooperation and conflicts resolution methods that have been developed  .
