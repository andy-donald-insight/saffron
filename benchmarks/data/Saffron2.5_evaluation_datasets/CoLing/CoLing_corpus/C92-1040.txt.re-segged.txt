In Combinatory Categnrial Grammar ( CCG)\[Ste 90 , Ste91\] , semantic function-argument structures are compositionally produced through the course of a derivation  . These structures identify , inter alia , which entities play the same roles in different events for expressions involving a wide range of coordinate constructs  . 
This sameness of role ( i . e . ~hematie ) information is not identified , however , across eases of verbal diathesis . To handle these cases as well , the present paper demonstrates how to adapt the solution developed in Conceptual Semantics\[  Jac90  , Jac 91\] to fit the CCG paradigm . 
The essence of the approach is to redefine the Linking Theory component of Conceptual Semantics in terms of CCG categories  , o that derivations yield conceptual structures representing the desired thematic information  ; in this way no changes are required on the CCG side  . While this redefinition is largely straightforward  , an interesting problem arises in the case of Corn ceptual Semantics ' Incorporated Argument Adjuncts  . 
In examining these , the paper shows that they cannot be treated as adjuncts in the CCG sense without introducing new machinery  , nor without compromising the independence of the two theories  . For this reason , the paper instead adopts the more traditional approach of treating them as oblique arguments  . 
1 Introduction
Tile present paper represents the first attempt to integrate Mark Steedman's theory of Combinatorial Categorial Grammar  ( CCG ) \[ Ste 90 ,   Ste91\] with Ray Jackendoff's theory of Conceptual Semantics\[  Jac90  , ~lac91\] . The former is known for its success hd treatment of tong-distance dependencies  , coordination , and , more recently , matters of discourse focus relating to intonation --- none of which have been treated within Conceptual Semantics  . The latter is known for its development of conceptual structures  , which are mental representations intended to serve as the link between language and other areas of cognition  , e . g . vision , action and inference--which CCG stops short of . Since CCG is a . lexically oriented theory of grammar , the two are entirely compatible , as well as complementary . 
The immediate motivation to attempt such an integration  , and the focus of the present paper , is CCG's incomplete treatment of sameness of role  ( i . e . thematic ) information . In CCG , semantic function-argument structures are compositionally produced through the course of a derivation  . These structures identify , inter alia , which entities play the same roles in different events for expressions involving a wide range of coordinate constructs  . For example , the semantic function-argument structure shown in  ( lb ) is derived for the sentence in ( la ) via typeraising , composition , and coordination of the bracketed nonstandard constituent  , following the analysis of Dowty\[Dow88\]:1 ( la ) Jackfilled\[theurn with coffee \] and\[the the rmos with milk\]  . 
(lb )   ( fill ' urn ' coffee ' jack ' )  &  ( fill ' thermos ' mill " jack ' ) Of course , such semantic function-argument structures are intended only for illustrative purposes  ; indeed , according to Steedman , semantic on stants like urn ' are " mere placeholders for a real semantics  , intended to do no more than illustrate this compositionality  . " Nevertheless , we may glean from these structures the requirement that urn ' and the rn * os ' play the same semantic role  , since they are both first arguments to fill ' , and likewise for coffee ' and milk ' , since they are both second arguments . In the terminology of Conceptual Semantics , these requirements may be restated in terms of thematic roles as follows : urn ' and lhermos ' share the thematic role Goal in their respective vents  ;   like-1The semantic role of determiners and tenne will be ignored in this paper  .

OFCOLING-92, NANTES , AUG .  2328 , 1992 wise , coffee ' and milk'share tile thematic role Theme  . 2 Now , while CCG can thus be said to identify thematic information across a wide range of expressions not easily analyzed in other theories  , it does not do so a cross cases of verbal diathesis  ( i . e , argument structure alternations ) . For example , consider (2) , together with two possible sets of interpretations that follow:  ( 2a ) Jack filled the urn with decaf . 
(2b ) The urn filled with decaf.
(2c ) Coffee filled the urn * with decal.
(3a ) fill ' urn ' decaf ~ jack ' ( 35 ) till'decaf'urn ' ( 3c ) tilt " urn ' coffee ' ( 4a ) t i  U . ' arn'deck/'jack'(45) fillb'decaf'urn , '  ( 4c ) fill ~' urn ' coffee ' Here it would not do to derive the function-argument structures shown in  ( 3 )  , as they incorrectly equate semantic roles in some eases  , t ' brexample , the roles of jack " and coffee " are incorrectly said to be the same for Jack filled the urn and Coffee filled the urn  . This problem may be avoided by introducing distinct constants ill //'  ( with possibly varying arities )  , as shown in (4) . Note , however , that this approach is incomplete , insofar as it fails to equate any semantic roles across the function stil ~'  , at least in the absence of further conditions on these functions  . 
To handle these cases as well , the present paper demonstrates how to adapt the solution developed in Conceptual Semantics to fit tile CCG paradigm  . This approach may be seen as one method of specifying  , in a principled fashion , the further conditions on constants like fill i ' necessary to give a complete account of thematic role identities  . 3 It should not be viewed , however , as a variant of purely syntactic approaches to verbal diathesis  , such as the Unaccusative tlypothesis\[ Bur86\] in GB , which posit movement between an underlying and a surface structure and traces to recover thematic roles  )   2 This restate taent is actually a cor~iderable at rengtheld ng bas CCG is not committed to anything stronger thm the individual thematic role view  ( cf . \[Dow 91D ; thai is , it requi~s nonmre than jack'play the " filler " role  , urn ' and thermos'play the " filled " role , etc .

The essence of the present approach is to redefine the Linking Theory component of Conceptual Semantics in teals of CCG categories  , so that derivations yield conceptual structures representing the desired thematic information  ; in this way no changes are required on the CCG side  . While this redefinition is largely straightforward  , an interesting problem arises ill the case of Conceptual Semantics ' Incorporated Argument Adjuncts  . In examining these , the paper shows that they cannot be treated as adjuncts in the CCG sense without introducing new machinery  , nor without compromising the independence of the two theories  . For this reason , the paper instead adopts the more tradition M approach of treating them as oblique arguments  . 
2 Preliminaries
This section reviews the details of CCG mid Conceptual Semmltics needed to understand their integration  . 
2.1 CCC =,
Exan ~ ple ( 2 ) sullices to review the necessary details of CCG . A CCG deriw ~ tion starts with lexical lookup , which identifies the functional type and semantics of cach constituent  . For example , the category of the verb fill needed for . lack filled the urn is as shown in ( 5 ) :  ( 5 ) ~ ill := ( $\ NP ) /NP : fill_a ' In this notation , a category consists of a syntacticate-gory paired via an infix colon with a semantic function  . 
Syntactic categories have arguments appearing to the right of slashes  , results to the left . The direction of the slash indicate stile direction of tlle argument  . Thus the syntactic ategory ( S\NP ) /NP defines a fimction that takes all NP to tile right and returns a function from an NP on the left to an S  . Categories may combine via forward or backward functional application  , indicated as ACTF~SDE COLING-92 , N h r c r e . s , 2328 AO~'r1992247 PROC . OFCOL1NG-92, NANTEs , AUG . 2328,1992 > and < in Figure 1 . Categories may also combine by other mean such as composition  , often yielding multiple derivations of the same string  . For present purposes this is of no significance , as all of the derivations of will produce the stone compositional meaning  . Derivations for the rest of the examples in ( 2 ) are quite similar , differing only in the lexically specified category for fill  . 
2.2 Conceptual Semantics
Example ( 2 ) again suffices to review the necessary details of Conceptual Semantics  . The version of Conceptual Semantics presented below is that of \[  Jac90\] prior to the introduction of Linking Theory , plus a few modifications . Let us begin with the representation fanurn . Jackendoff represents an urn as the conceptual structure shown in  ( 6 ) :  ( ~ ) \[ Thing URN\]This represents an entity of ontological type Thing that meets the featural description URN  . 5 To distinguish different urns , I will follow Zwarts and Verkuyl\[ ZV91\] in requiring all conceptual structures to have an index  , as shown in ( 7a ) :  ( 7a ) \[ Thing URN\]j ( Tb ) Thing ( j ) & URN ( j ) Note that under the Zwarts and Verkuyl formalization  ,   ( 7a ) is roughly equivalent to the more familiar ( 7b )  . 
In addition to the ontological type Thing , an entity may be of type Place , Path , Event , State , Manner or Property . The Place in t , heurn , for example , would be represented as in ( 8a ) :  ( 8& ) \[ Place IN ( \[ThinsURN\]/ ) \] p ( 8b ) Place ( p ) & IN ( j , p ) & Thing ( j ) & URN ( j ) Here we have a conceptual function IN : Thing ~ Place mapping the urn j to the locatiou inside the ur np  . Example ( 8b ) is again an approximate notational variant . 
Moving onto the stative reading of example (2c ) , Coffee filled the urn , we introduce the conceptual function BE : Thing x Place-  , State ( note that as in this example , ontological categories and indices will often ~ Sma\]l caps will be used to indicate feature ~ that are atomic in Conceptual Structure  , serving old y ~ links to other areas of cognition . 
be suppressed for typographical convenience ) :  ( 9a ) \[BE ( \[COFFEE\] , , \[ IN(\[URN\])\]p ) \]
State FILLs (9b ) State(a ) & FILL(g ) & BE(i , p , s ) & .   .   . 
Extending \[ Jac90\] , I have included the conceptual to mFILL in (9a ) . As is the case of other categories , this atom serves as a pointer to semantic information ot captured by the decomposition  . Thus the states is to be understood as one characterized by the atom FILL and by the feature B E  ( I , p ) . Note that the variant in ( 9b ) is reminiscent of the neo-Davidsonian approach adopted by Parsons\[  Parg0\]  . 
To get the inchoative reading of (2c ) , we need only add the conceptual function INCH : State-~Event shown in  ( 10 ) : IINCH ( \[BE ( \[cOFFEE\]'[IN ( \[ URN\] ) \] ) 1 FIL ) 
Event ? (10)
The conceptual structure for example (2b ) , The urn filled with deca ~ , would differ minimally from ( 10 ) by having\[DECAF\]as the Theme instead of \[ COFFEE \]  , or by having the Theme left implicit . 
We are now in a position to construct he conceptual structure for example  ( 2a )  , Jack filled the urn with decal , by adding the External Instigator function C ( AU ) S ( E ) : Thing x Event--*Event and the Actor-Patient function AFF  ( ECT ) : Thing x Thing ~-*
Event : (1In ) FILL
AFF(\[JACK\]/,\[URNJj)
Event FIL Le ( llb ) Event ( e ) & FILL ( e ) & AFF ( i , j , e ) & .   .   . 
Here the representation f the inchoative vent serving as the second argument of CS has an implicit Themek  , which the with-PP would specify if present . Note also that the entity\[JACK\]/serves as both Actor and External Instigator  , and likewise\[URN\]/serves as both Pa-tiant midGoal  , by virtue of coindexation . And again , the variant in ( 1lb ) indicates the similarity of this approach to the neo-Davidsonianoe  . 
At this point we may observe that representations in  ( 9 )  -  ( 11 ) capture the similarities and differences in semantic roles observed in tile arguments of the verb ACTESDE  COLING-92  , NANTES , 2328 Ao(rr 1992 248 PROC . OFCOLING-92, NANTES , AUG . 2328, 1992 fill in (2) . This follows straightforwardly from the inclusion of representations  ( 9 ) mid ( 10 ) within ( 11 )  , together with the semantic o indexation . 
Next we turn to a brief description of how these representations are constructed in \[  Jac90\]  . Two representative lexical entries , that of the stative Jill of ( 2c ) and causative-inchoative fill of ( 2a )  , are shown below : lfill\]V__NPj\[\[FILLBE ( \[ Thing \] i , \[ IN(\[Thins\]j)\])\](12) fill
V__NP jt pp with NPk\]
CSi INCHBE(k , \[ IN(j)\])\]1 LFILL(13) in (12) , the verb fill subcategorizes an object NP indexed j  , as well as an external argument indexediby convention  . Sinfilarly , (13) subcategorizes an object NP and a wi~h-PP . Arguments to the verb are integrated into the above conceptual structure using the Argument Fusion Rule  , which links the coindexed constituents in the obvious way  , as long as they are semantically compatible . 
3 Linking Theory
This section details how the Linking Theory component of Conceptual Semantics can be redefined in terms of CCG categories  , so that derivations yield conceptual structures like  ( 9 )  -  ( 11 )  . Before introducing Linking Theory , however , we shall first examine how timversion of Conceptual Semantics presented in the last section can he adapted to fit the CCG paradigm  . 
As was suggested in , Section 1 , the present approach may be seen as specifying constraints on the constants \] Jill'so that the desired thematic role identities are captured  . This may be done by simply redefining lexical entries like  ( 12 ) and ( 13 ) as follows : fill

S\NP/NP ~ ji.\[BE~i , tN(j)\])\](14) fill

S\NP/PP ( with)/NP
CS(i , INCII(BE(k,\[IN(j)\]))) 1
AjlS . AFF(i , j)
FILL (15)
II ere the subcategorization frmnes have been replaced by the appropriate CCG categories  , and the conceptual structures have been made into the appropriate functions corresponding to the filli ' constants  . Because this information is supplied lexically , no changes need be made on the CCG side . Thus conceptual structures for sentences like those in  ( la ) and ( 2 ) may be easily derived with the addition of just a few more lexical items like those below :  6 
Jack \] (16) PNNP\[JACK\]with\]
Prep(17) I'P ( with)/NP ~ x.x
Given such lexical items , the constants appearing in ( lb ) and ( 4 ) may be replaced yielding fimctions like the first one appearing in Figure  2  , which is equivalent mudulo an appropriate definition of \]?- reduction to tile one appearing  ; beh ) wit . Such a defnition must mirror that of Argument Fnsion  , insofar as it must append feature specified by tile argument to those specified  6This particular with-PP i6 treated a A semantically vacuou a , unlike ( say ) the ~ ith-accompamment modifier .

(19)* Theurn dellifed Jack.
To capture such generalizations , Jackendoff proposes to eliminate rigid coindexation between syntactic and semantic structures  , opting to introduce Linking Theory to handle this task instead  . Lexieal entries are therefore modified to indicate only which conceptual constituents must be specified  , and not which syntactic constituents must specify them  . The selected conceptual arguments are annotated with an A  , or A-marked . 
In presenterms , this means changing entries like ( 15 ) to ones like ( 20 ) : ~' fill , dell if

Categories like the one in ( 15 ) thus become derived in-rT hew/~h-PP is unselected for exp ~ it itory reasons only  . 
stead of lexically specified , with Linking Theory specifying constraints on such derivations to permit Ajias the only possible argument ordering  . The central idea behind such constraints i as follows : Given  ( independently motivated ) syntactic and semantic hierarchies , do not allow inconsistent orderings . This is stated more formally in ( 21 ) :  ( 21 ) Linking Principle : A semantic function headed by Aa : l  . . . xn in a CCG category must not have Xi-~sem~j and ~ i ~' ~ ynx/  , or vice versa , where - ~ sern and " ~ sy , encode the semantic and syntactic hierarchies , respectively . 
Note that if Actor " ~ semPatient and Subject-% ynDirectObject  , then the ordering A ij ( with indices as before ) required for dell if is indeed ruled out by the Linking Principle  . s As developed so far , tile status of the Linking Principle in the present framework is that of a filter on representations  . The Linking Principle may be made more constructive by eliminating syntactic specifications from lexical entries  , following ( say ) Rappaport and Levin \ [ RL88\] or Pinker\[ Pin89\]  , deriving them instead via Linking Rules which obey the Linking Principle  . :\] ackend off does not rule out this possibility , but chooses to develop instead an approach in which both syntactic and semantic subcategorization is retained  . 
I shall part company with Jackendoff on this issue  , as I find his arguments in favor of retaining subcategorization unconvincing  . These arguments are twofold . 
First , verbs appear to idiosyncratically specify prepositions  . Such verbs may be accommodated within the present framework by simply providing fully specified categories like  ( 15 )  . Second , and more interestingly , some Incorporated Argument Adjuncts arc syntactically obligatory  . This argument presupposes , of course , a Observe that the syntactic ordering cannot be defined from the syntactic type if subjects are to precede complements  .

Figure 3: A Derivation Involving the Hypothetical
CCG With-Theme Adjunct , the correctness of the Incorporated Argument Adjunct analysis  , to which we now turn . 
4 Incorporated Argument Adjuncts
Jackendoff observes that with-PPs may specify an optional Theme argument across a wide range of verbs  . 
This observation leads him to hypothesize that such with-Theme should not be treated as subcategorized arguments  , bnt rather as adjuncts . Suchau analysis is partieulary appealing in cases involving an incorporated Theme  , such as butter , as in Jack but-feted ~ hebread with that yacky stuff  . 9 We shall see , however , that this analysis cannot be adapted into the present framework without adding substantial new machinery  ,   1? nor without compromising the independence of the two theories  . In contrast , the traditional oblique argument analysis will be seen to surmount these difficulties in a natural way  . 
Jaekendoff's informal version of the With-Theme
Adjunct Rule is repeated below: ( 22 ) With-Theme Adjunct Rule : In a sentence containing with NP in the VP  , if the Theme position is not indexed in the verb 's lexical entry  , then the object of with cazl be interpreted as Theme  . 
With (22) in mind , one might try to redefine (17) as follows:
Prep(23) ( S\Nl')\(S\m')/NP
Ayfz . with Themey(fx )
Here with is defined as a function from an NP to a VP-nit shtmld be noted that Jackendo if does not adequately address the issue of why the class of a pread ~ appropriate for the verb butteria larger than the class apppopriate for the  , mue noun . 
l ? As was done in m~eariervexalon of this paper.
modifier , where the constant With Theme stands in for the function that fuses the Theme with the specified NP  . A sample syntactic derivation using ( 23 ) is shown in Figure 3 . 
There are two problems with adequately specifying the function with Th~me  . First , one might question its introduction on theoretical grounds  , as it marks a substantial departure from the simple rule  ( 18 )  , /3-reduction as Argument Fusion , compromising the independence of the two theories  . Second , there is an empirical problem of avoiding examples like  ( 2c )  , * CoSec filled the urn wi~h decaf . In (22) , Jackendoff stipulates that the Thenmposition be unindexed in the verb's lexical entry  . This argmneut indexing information is no longer available  , however , at the point in the derivation in which the with Thcme constant is to perform its magic  , since the function ( fx ) is already saturated . 
Again , while adequate fixes might be possible , any such approach would seem quite ad hoc . 
Instead of treating these wilh-PPs as adjuncts , we may rehrter pret Jackendoff's ( 22 ) as a Linking Rule for oblique with-Theme PP arguments  . This rule would then bcjust one of those necessary to derive the cate ~ gory in  ( 15 ) from tim lexical entry in ( 24 ) below ; other rules would map Actors to Subject NPs , Patients to Direct Object NPs , etc . Note that in this entry the subcategorization f the Theme argmnent is indicated to be optional by tim curly braces : fill 
V (24)
Under this formulation , both of the problen ~ q mentioned above disappear : first  , the Theme's specifica ~ tion again becomas like that of any other argument  , and second , the ungrammatieality of * Coffee filled the urn with decal again becomes a straightforward consequence of the independently motivated  ( Neo )  0-

At this point we may return to Jaekeadoff's argument in favor of retaining syntactic subcategoriza ~ tion  . After having chosen to treat oblique argumeuts as Incorporated Arguum nt Adjuncts  , Jackendoff then observes that they are not always optional  . Rath cr than retreat , however , he suggests that these are cases of syntactic subcategorization not matching semantic subcategorization  . For example , consider ( 25 ) :  ( 25 ) Jack rid the room *0/ of insects . 
The verb * ~ dislike empty in taking an of-Theme Pl '  , AcrEslJ ~ COLl NG-92 , NANTES , 2328 AO~r19922$1 PROC . or : COLING-92, Na~rr ~ . s , AUG .  2328 ,   1992 semantically the inverse of the with-Theme PP . Unlike empty , however , the PP is obligatory for r/d . This leads Jackdendoff to posit a lexieal entry like  ( 26 )  , in which the Theme is not A-marked but the PP is obligatory  . Such lexical entries are then used to argue in favor of retaining syntactic subeategorizatiou  . This rather unusual move does not seem to be necessary  , however . ~ Consider the representation adopted in the present framework  , appearing in (27) . This representation adequately captures r/d's idiosyncratic selection facts by simply requiring the A-marking of the Theme  , forcing the appearance of the with-PP . Of course , to the extent that the existence of lexical entries like  ( 26 ) is called into question , the argument following from their existence becomes likewise suspect  .

It has argued that ( 1 ) Conceptual Semantics need only be minimally modified to adapt it to tile CCG paradigm  , thus providing CCG with a more complete account of thematic role identities  , and ( 2 ) these changes need not affect CCG at all if Conceptual Semantics ' Incorporated Argument Adjuncts are treated as oblique arguments  .
