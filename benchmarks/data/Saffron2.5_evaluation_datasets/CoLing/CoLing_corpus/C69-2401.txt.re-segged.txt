The core of any system of content a ~ alysis is a dictionary speci- 
fying the content categories to be assigned to verbal units  . The system described in this paper utilizes a category dictionary in which all the conmon words of English are classified into one or two oflid possible catecories  .   2 The associated cemputer method is at present capable of analyzing a text of  25  , 000 words in about 20 minutes of machine time , outputting a distribution of frequency of occurrence of the  116 content categories . Up to 15 separate texts may be analyzed at the same time , or the productions of \] 5 speakers , mixed in any way , as long as each segment is identified with the appropriate source  . 
The cc~puter analysis program will be discussed briefly  , as will some of the considerations which went into the construction of the dictionary  . An il\]nstration of the analysis of textual mater ~ a \] will be presented  , and two studies applying the procedure will be described  . 
Preparing , a ~ and machine analysis
For any Enc ! ish language corpus to be an e ~! yzed , a simple edit in C proce@Are is fo \]\] c ~ zed before the text is card punched  . The editor I . Presented at the International Conference on Computational Linguistics  , S~-S ~ y- , ~ ursgard , ~ weden , Sept . I-4,1969 . 
2 . T ~ o of the categories ( no score and hand-~core ) are not actu ~!\] y content categories . 
eliminates a number of functions words ( articles , most conjunctions , auxiliary verbs such as J~be and ~~ , changes all verb forms into the present infinitive form  , and reduces plural noun forms to the singular . These editing changes are required because the dictionary contains only the root forms of the word  . Illustrations 3 and 5 show a text and its edited form . Ultimately , as the dictionary expands to include common forms  , many of these editing requirements will be reduced  . There are 20 , 000 root forms in the dictionary at present . The editing pro-cedu ~ e reduces an original text by between  15% end 20%: a 25  , 0 00 edited text would originally have consisted of around  40  , 000 words . 
The computer analysis is directed solely to content  , and does not take grammatical form into account . The analysis thus shows what is being talked about  , but provides no information that the grammar ordinarily conve ~  . It may show that aggression is a major theme of a text  , but will not show who is aggressing against whom . The researcher may choose to analyze for total content  , as represented by the 116 categories , or specify a limited number of content categories  , in which case the program will disregard all other categories  . 
The program is at present written in Fortran IV and MAP languages  ( ultimately to be entirely in Fortran IV )  . It consists of a number of subroutines capable of performing the following operations on a text : I  . Print the text itself , numbering each line . 
2 . Output the text words in order of occurrence , showing is peaker and line number . 
3 . Output the text words in alphabetic order , showing speaker and line number . 
4 . Output a list of words matched with the stored dictionary  , shewing the categories which have been applied to each matched word  , the speaker number , and the line number . 
5 . Output a list of words which have more than one possible scoring in the dictionary  ( ambiguous words )  , showing either a selected number of the possible scoring  , or all the scorings . Speaker number and line number are also indicated . 
6 . Output a list of words which the dictionary cannot define because they are not represented by dictionary entries  . 
7 . Output profiles of the frequency of occurrence of each of the  116 categories for each speaker . 
8 . Output a punched deck of category frequency profiles so that further statistical analyses may be applied  . 
Th__~e Dictionar ~
To find conceptual uniformities in the vocabulary of a language poses formidable problems  . In typical content analyses , the researcher takes sentences or larger units , and evaluates them as to the presence or absence of a particular concept  , dismissing as irrelevant to his purpose any material which does not bear on the concept  . This approach is inadequate if one wishes to deal with all of the content of the sample  . 
There are certain ampirical bases for developing a conceptional system which will deal with all possible contents  . The steps in such a process may be described briefly  . Numerous words are substantially similar to each other  , and essentially synonymous in particular contexts . 
Dictionaries take advantage of this fact to introduce us to the meaning of unfamiliar words  , by providing a synonymous word which we ~ ow . 
Synonyms are of course not alwgys substitutable for each other without some change of meaning  , for words may partake of more than one domain of meaning  . 
The number of separate domains of meaning each occupied by a few synonyms is extremely large  . As a step toward reduction one may group words similar in meaning  , even if not synonymous . Words like walk , run , rid__~e , and ~ oreadily group together as sharing a c ~ on meaning  . Application of the criterion of similarity along with that of synonymy leads to broader and more inclusive clusters of words  . 
A further reduction in the number of clusters or domains of meaning may be effected by applying an additional criterion for grouping words : that of relatedness  . If a set of words such as chair , stool , bench , seat , and couch is grouped by synonymy and similarity , considerations of relatedness may also bring tabl__~e into the same domain of references ~ a common item of household furnishing  . The merging of tabl . .__~e and chai__~r into one group also projects the outlines of a category which could in-ciude other ~ like be__dd  , dress e______~r , burea _______uu , ches____~t , all of which also refer to ordinary house hold furnishings  . These principles of synonymy , similarity , and relatedness , whe ~ applied systematically to words , produce a system of categories limited in number but still capable of describing meaningfully all the content soft ~ elanguage  . 
When a certain degree of stability has been reached in constructing categories  , new words may be considered in terms of how they will fit into the system  . ~ his does not preclude changing the system ; it merely weighs all the prior Judgments against each new Judgment to be made  , and accepts change Only on compelling grounds . As the system grows , changes are more likely to occur because two existing categories are seen to border too closely on each other and to require redefinition of their boundaries and differences  , rather than because new categories are discovered . 
A primary consideration in construction of the present conceptual dictionary was that the scheme of language had to provide an adequate basis  , at the very least , for discriminating the language of one speaker from another  . ~ his meant that each entity in the scheme had to contribute to such potential  . In practice this militated against units which were heavily loaded with tokens from everyone's speech and against units which rarely contributed a token to anyone's speech  . Such global categories as " nature , "" man , "" animate " and " inanimate " provide very little basis for discriminating between the word predilections of separate speakers  , since they inevitably contribute large numbers of tokens to everyone's speech  . 
Relatively simple criteria for the acceptability of a category in the overall scheme were  ( I ) that it not draw ~ oo many or too few tokens , and ( 2 ) that it contribute to discriminating between separate speakers  . 
~ ere , in the present scheme , a category turned out to be large by these criteria  , what was also readily apparent was some basis for splitting the category along one or more lines to produce separate categories  . 
And where a category seemed to on arrow , it was possible to merge it with another neighboring category  , the domain of reference thans well-ing to include both meanings  . The area of hostility and aggression was one which required subdivision along lines which differentiated violence  , anger , and simple disagrees nent . The area of sex , in which at the outset a discrimination was provided between heterosexual and homosexual  , ended by becoming a single area , since very few references occur to homose xuality as such as opposed to sexuality in general  . 
One other criterion which was applied is related to well ~ own ideas of reliability and validity  . The domains of reference in a scheme of language must be sufficiently discriminable from each other so that separate judges considering a word will be in agreement as to which categories are involved  . If the dcemins of meaning are too closely related  , this will be a difficult Judgment and an unreliable one  . To the extent that it is unreliable , its validity and its pertinence to other behavior  , will be dubious . Distinctiveness of a domain of reference in a dictionary scheme is therefore an important desideratum  . 
Over the years , as texts from various sources were analyzed , with a continuing effort to fit new words into existing groups or to redefine the word groups to make them more congruent with word meanings  , a dictionary of words with their appropriate categories emerged  . The dict-tionary and its mode of application are illustrated on the following pages which shc~T :  !  . Definitions of a few categories . I 2 .

iO3 . A Selection from Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels My father had a smalle state in Nottinghamshire  ; I was the third of fives on s . He sent me to Emmanuel College in Cambridge at fourteen years old  , where I resided three years , and applied myself close to my studies ; but the charge of maintaining me ( although lhad a very scanty allowance ) being too great for a narrow for tune , I was bound apprentice to Mr . James Bates , a neminent surgeon in London , with whom I continued four years , and my father now and then sending mesmall smm ~ of money  , Ilaid them out in learning navigation and other parts of the mathematics useful to those who intend to travel  , as I always believed it would be some time or other my for tune to do  . When I left Mr . Bates , I want downtomy father , where , by the assistance of him and my uncle John and same other relations  , I got for typounds , and a prmmise of thirtypounds a year to maintain meatLey den  ; there I studied physic two years and seven months  , knowing it would be useful in long voyages . 
So on aftermy return from Leyden , I was recommended by my good master D ~ . Bates to be surgeon to the Swall c ~ , Captain Abraham Pannell Commander , with whom I continued three years and a half , making avoy-age or two into the Levant and same other parts  . When Icsmeback I resolved to settle in London , to which Mr . Bates , my master , encouraged me , and by him I was reco~a ended to several patients . I took part of a muall house in the Old Jewry , and , being advised to altermy comdition , Imarried Mrs . Mary Burton , second daughter to ' Mr . Edmund Burton , hosier in Newgate Street , with whom I received four hundred paunds for a portion  . 
But my good master Bates dying in two years after , and I having few friends , my business began to fail ; for myeonsciance would not
II suffer me to imitate the bad practice of too many among m ~ brethren  . 
Having , therefore , consulted with my wife and some of my acquaintances  , I determined to go again to sea . I was surgeon successively in two ships , and made several voyages for six years to the East and West Indies  , by which I got some addition to my fortune . My hours of lei -" sureI spent in reading the best authors  , ancient and mode~n , being always provided with a good number of books  , and when I was a shore in observing the manners and dispositions of the people  , as well as learning their language , wherein I had a great facility by the strength of mymmaory  . 
The last of these voyages not proving very fortunate  , Igrew weary of the Sea , and intended to stay at home with my wife and family  . I removed from the Old Jewry to Fetter Lane , and from thence to Wapping , hoping to get business among the sailors , but it would not turn to account . After three years'expectation that things would mend  , I accepted an advantageous offer from Capta in William Prichard  , master of the Antel ~ e , who was making avoyage to the South Sea . We set sail from Bristol , May 4 ,  1699 , and our voyage at first was very prosperous .

PROFILE TOTALS 731   446 * H and Score and NoScore items are not tabulated when a profile is scored by hand  . 

To illustrate the application of the computer analysis  , two studies are described , one , of the freeflowing language of children , the other , of scientific writings . 
A book by Evelyn G . Pitcher and Ernst Pre ! inger ( 1963 ) presents stories told by boys and girls from ages  2 to 5  , taken down in shorthand by one of the authors . These were a group of economically privileged children attending a nursery and kindergarten of a private school  . 
~/ ost of the children were of superior or high average intelligence  . 
When the occasion presented itself and the child was for the mament playing alone  , the researcher asked , " Tell meastory . " ~ ly those stories were rejected which were a retelling of a familiar fairy tale or television show  . 
The stories taken from the Pitcher-Prelinger book were transcribed onto  13~ cards end analyzed by computer to obtain profiles showing the distribution of the content of each age group  . In order to sharps ~ the subsequent analysis , all categories showing a frequency of less than 1% of the total responses within each profile were elim ~ ated  . Also eliminated was the one category ( ANIMAL ) which showed a uniform high frequency ( over 7% of the total ) for each profile . These extremely low and extremely high frequency categories are eliminated because they contribute only to raising all correlatiens between profiles and do not contribute to discriminating between profiles  . ~ he profiles , now consisting of 52 categories were then correlated with each other , and the matrix of correlations factor analyzed . I will not present the actual factor analysis , but only describe the outcome . 

The first factor in the analysis is a " female " factor  . The girls in allage groups load very highly on it  . When we look in detail at the categories which contribute most heavily to this factor we find that YOUNG  , F ~ MALE , and HELP are the three outstanding contributors . 
In the category system , F ~ ALE and HELP are the two scorings which apply to the word mother and its variants  . These findings suggest that the girls of the study had ascentral themes in their fantasy  , ideas relating to mothers ( feminine helpers ) and children . 
The second factor is more clearly relevant to boys  , with a ges3 and 4 showing predominance . The most significant categories here are GO , MALE , and TF-~NSPORTATION . Thus , the boys in the group , particularly those in the 3 and 4 year bracket , had prominently in their fantasies , references tomaleness , physical movement , and vehicles of transportation . 
The third factor applied primarily to girls age 4 and boys age 5  . 
Primary categories were MALE , GO , and FEATURE ( bodily features ) . The F~UP ~ and ~ LE categories would be consistent with a psychoanalytic view that at this age both boys and girls are in the oedipal period and are becoming preoccupied with sexuality  , and particularly with the relationship to father . 
The fourth factor seems most clearly applicable to boysage  2  , although to a lesser degree it is characteristic of boys age  3  , suggest-
Iinga decay process with age . Here the outst ~ nd in C categories are c~r FLICTI ( physical harm )  , GO , and YOUNG . Like the other boys , the t~o year olds were also occupied ~ th physical movement  . Li ~ the girls , they were occupied with ideas about children ; but violent aggres-sic ~ was their most prominent concern and distinguishes them most clearly from other groups A second study by Hartsough and Laffal explores the question whether scientists who have been described as visual imagists and scientists who have been described as verbal imagists  ( Roe ,  1952 ) will also differ in the types of content ~ mployed in their writing  . The four sciences which Roehad studied were Social Science  , Biology , Experimental Physics , and Theoretical Physics . Based on a series of projective tests and interviews with scientists in these fields  , as well as their self-reports of problem solving activities and typical modes of thinking about problems  , she concluded that Social Scientists and Theoretical P~sicists were verbal imagists  , while Biologists and Experimental Physicists were visual imagists  . Verbal imagery is thinking ~ In words or talking to one self  , while visual imagery is thinking in p~ctures . 
In our study , we selected three outstandino-livings c~@nt ~sts from each of these four disciplines  , the Soc ~! Seiences being represented by Anthropologists  . For each Scient is to nere ~ esentative book was chosen from his technical publications addressed to colleagues  , sn done from his popular writings for the laity . The keywords scientist , ~, . Anthropolosy , and ~ were used to identify contexts for comparison  . A context included the sen~nce containing the key word  , the preceding sentence , and the subsequent sentence . In and a Physics textbook of this time were also selected  . The content of the textbooks was sampled by taking three sentences alternately from the top  , middle and bottom of every other page , without regard to any keywords . The writings of the various scientists , and in the texts , were analyzed by the com ~ rater program described , and content category profiles were obtained . These profiles were then correlated with each other and factor analyzed  . I will not present details of the factor analysis  , but only the results . 
Highly represented on the first factor were all of the Anthropol-ogical writings  , and the writings of the Theoretical Physicists . Since these two groups together constitute what Roehad called the verbal scientists  , the first factor could be considered a verbal factor  . The actual content which was stressed in the writings of these scientists  , however , evokes more the idea of a " humanistic ': factor , since the particular categories contributing most importantly to the factor are R ~ SG ~  1   ( kn  ~ ; ledge and thinking ) , GROUP , HELP , and GOOD . 
Thus , the content analysis tells us that what manifests itself as a highly developed verbal co~anicative s ~ ll  , also reflects a concern with hlinen affairs and human issues  . Since language is parexcellence the social skill  , it is natural that those who use it best would also be those whose attention is directed toward the ht~mn condition  . 
The second factor was clearly related to Physics , the writinEs of the Theoretical and Applied Physicists loading highest on it  . The categories which contributed most to this factor were : REASON  3  %  ( science )  , NAT ~ IAL , REASON1 ( knowledge and thinking ) and SOME . Other categories which were stressed were ESSENTIAL and TIME  4   ( general time )  . 
The third factor was clearly a biological factor , since the biological writings loaded highest on it  . The categories of greatest importance were : FUNCTION  ( bodily functions )  , BEGINCHANGE , MATEP~IAL and FOR-

To be noted is that no " visual " factor as such appeared in the analysis  . This suggests that the contrast which had been drawn by Roebetween " verbal " and " visual " may actually be a contrast between those with a central humanistic concern inclined to be strongly verbal in their thinking  , and those who do not have this same central interest  , who are more likely to stress nonverbal processes in their thinking  . 
The method of total content analysis which I have described is applicable to many language content problems  . Beside the applications described in the present paper  , the technique has been used in studies of the symbolism of keywords in the language of a psychotic patient  ( Laffal ,  1960) ; changes in the language of a patient in treatmen ~   ( Laffal ,  1961) ; comparison of the language of therapists in tal ~ ng about different patieuts  ( Watson & Laffal ,  1963) ; comparisons of the content given by subjects in single word association  , continuous word association , and free speech in response to the same stimulus word  ( Laffal & Feldx ~ an ,  1962 ,  1963) ; comparison of the language of two and three speakers in conversations about a variety of topics  ( Laffal ,  1967) . 
In broadest terms the method may be applied to comparison of one individual with himself  ( for example , over time ) ; one individual with 2B another ; a group with itself or with other groups ; the contexts surrounding one topic with those surrounding some other topic  . The unique contribution which it makes is in the use of a category dictionary which classifies all the ccma on words of ~ glish into one or two content categories  , so permitting rapid display either of all the content or of selected contents  , in a text .
