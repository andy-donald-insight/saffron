C , omi ) utational ai ) proaches to reference resolution , like Centering Theory , are best at resolving referring expressions which denote familiar reD  . rents . We demonstrate how , byt~king a proof-theoretic approach to reference resolution within a Centering-type framework  , we are able to make sense of ret i ; rring expressions t brun familiar referents . These include , in addition to bridging descriptions , definite descripl ; ions like " the first man " and " the first snow drops of Spring "  . We claim that the first of these denotes a unique subset of a if lural discourse antecedent  . 
While the second has no discourse antecedent , we similarly treat it as denoting amfi ( lue subset of at ' ~ nnilia referent . 
1. Introduction
I to w do ret i ; rringexl ) ressions denote ? According to II . ussell , a definite description such as % he King of France "  , denotes amfique individual by virtue of its meaning  . But , according to Familiarity Theory ( Helm , 1 . 983) , ret i ; rring expressions need not denotem fiquely by virtue of their meaning as they refer to individuals made familiar by the discourse or other context  . This observation plays a key role in Centering Theory  ( Grosz and Sidner , 1986; Grosz et al ,  1995 ) and other computation alal ) t ) roaches in which rethrring expressions are resolved by locating their antecedents in the discourse  . The reference of pronouns like " he " , definite descriptions like " the woman " , and referential tenses like " had " clearly has more to do with salience ill context thml with uniqueness of meaning  . Similarly , while names like " Mary " need not denote individuals prominent in the discourse context  , *\ Ve would like to thank the anonymous reviewers for their detailed and helpful comments  . 
they must nevertheless denote individuals familiar to conversants if they are successflflly to refer  . However , there is another ( : lass of referring expressions in relation to which we believe the concept of uniqueness of meaning does have an essential role toplt ~ y  . These include such definite descrit ) tions as " the first man " and " the first snow drop of Spring "  , along with such variations on these as " the first three men " and " the first snow drops of Spring "  . 
In implementing a system of retL , renee resolution , we have attemt ) ted to reconcile the notions of familiarity mM uniqueness  . This enables us to dere li ; rencexl ) ressions like " the first snow-drop of Spring " in a unified framework alongs ideanal  ) hers ~ , pron(mns , retbrential tenses , names , and other definite descriptions like " then lall " . 
(1) T Two menn rrive(t.
(2) The . fir.st'm , a'H , spoke.
In the case of a referring expression like " the first min i "  , there may be an antecedent of sorts in the discourse  , trot it is not the individual referred to ( or indeed ml individual at all )  . We will say that the antecedent " two men " introduces a set  , and that the referring expression " the first man " denotes  , by virtue of the meaning of . first , a unique subset of this familiar set . 
(1) Mary sawth , e first snow d , vp of

In the case of " tile first snow drop of Spring " , there need be no explicit antecedent in the discourse  . We will s~w that , in the same way that " Mary " denotes a familiar individual  , " the snow drops of Spring " denotes at ' ~ nniliar set  , or > v Veuse this term to distinguish reflexives like " herself " from t  ) ronouns like " he " and " hiln " . 
775 property . Again , by virtue of tile meaning of first , " tile first snow drop of Spring " can be said to denote a unique subset of the familiar set  . We will not claim that it denotes a unique individual  , but that rather it denotes a unique subset of the specified cardinality  , i . e . , 1 . This treatment hastile advantage that it extends to plural referring expressions  . 
Below we outline the approach we have developed to the representation ad resolution of referring expressions  , betbre discussing in more detail its extension to deal with unfamiliar ef-erents  . 
2 A Framework for Reference
Resolution
Our framework for reference resolution has been implemented in the system of language understanding described in  ( Ramsay ,  1999) . The starting point tbr reference resolution is the logical tbrm we obtain fl ' omparsing  . For example , the tbllowing is the logical tbrm we get for the utterance " Mary slept  . " ~ A : A is interval $ ~ fo , 'e( , ' ef ( aB ( Vech , _tie(B ,  1))) , A ) 3C : aspect ( simple , A , C ) 0 ( C , agen . t , ref(,kD(,, . amed(D , Mary ) gcard(D , 1)))) sleep(C )
C is event
We use tile inference engine described in ( Ramsay and Seville ,  2000 ) to update the discourse model with a new discourse state containing the intbrmation explicitly represented in tile logical tbrm together with any further inferences which are licensed given the existing discourse model  . Reference resolution , which involves carrying out a proof that a retbrring expression denotes  , is implemented as part of the update step . We anchor a referring expression like ref ( )~D ( named ( D , Marg ) & card(D ,  1 ) ) ) intile discourse model by proving the existence of an entity in the model which satisfies the properties specified by the referring expression  , in this case a D(na , ~ ed(D , Mary ) ~ ea , ' d(D ,  1)) 2 . 
2Strictly speaking , it is a set which is denoted . For readability , our referring expressions conflate timproperties of sets and their members  . In this case , the cardinality is a property of the set denoted , but then mne
Mary is a property of its member.
Given that many referring expressions do not in themselves denote uniquely  , however , we need a theory of reference resolution to enable us to obtain the appropriate  ( i . e . , intended ) ret-erent for any referring expression . We incorporate our theory of reference resolution into the actual representation of referring expressions  ; for example , we label anaphors with the property " salient " and pronouns  ( and also referential tenses ) with the property " centred " 3: " himself " ref ( AX ( salient ( X , ref(AD(eds(D ))) $ ~ m(X ))) " she ~ , ref ( ) , X ( ee . .tred(X , reZ ( ) , D ( e& ( D )   ) ~ Z ( X )   ) Retbrence resolntion relies on maintaining , as in Centering Theory , a list of t brward-looking centres for each discourse state  ( corresponding to an utterance ) in the discourse . Furthermore , for the purposes of reference resolution , the discourse states themselves are organized into a discourse tree  , which is constructed automatically based on referential cues  4  , as described in ( Seville ,  1999) . 

I23/1\(2) hei hadj been sleeping ther %.
(3) a woman l loved m h im/.
(4) shez had , ~ hated him/.
(5) he/hadm hated himself/.
(6) he ~: had mloved herl.
The nodes in such a tree correspond to discourse states  . Those olltile righthand frontier are open , which essentially means that tile entities mentioned in them are available to pronominal reference  . 
The process of reference resolution fortile various referring expressions can be briefly described as t bllows  . Anaphors , characterised as salient , are resolved to a less oblique argument of the same verb  ( Pollard and Sag , 1994) within the current discourse state , which is constructed a Here rcf ( AD ( cds ( D ) ) is a reference to the current discourse state and the properties m and f refer to male and female gender espectively  . 
4The tree illustrated was constructed using pronominal cues  . Each discourse state was attached as a daughter of the highest node in the discourse tree to which all pronouns and referential tenses  ( like had ) mentioned in it could be anchored . 
776 incrementally . We also st ; art oursere ' oht br the referents of prononns and other centred entities in the current disconrse state  , which is necessary if we are to resolw ; such referring expressions as " her " in " Mary took John with her  . " However , referring expressions containing the property centred are prevented front  1  ) eing de referenced to salient entities , thus ensuring that the constraint of disjoint reference is met  . If we fail to tind the centred entity in the current discourse state  , we search the previous open node and , if necessary , fllr-theropen nodes in the discourse tree , in order to deal with long-distance pronominalisation  . 
The dereferencing of other referring expressions like ref  ( AD ( named ( D , Mary ) gcard(D ,  1 ) ) ) is similar but less constrained in that we consider entities mentioned in all nodes mentioned in the discourse  , tree , whether open or closed , in order of recency . This means that , essentially , names and definite descriptions are deref-created to the most recently mentioned referent which is appropriate  . Unlike in the case of pronouns , we also consider Discourse State 0 , which doesn't correspond to an utterance but , rather , contains the background knowledge as-stoned in the model  . This is how we are able to deal with the first mention of a familiar referent like Mary  ( assmning that the properties kD ( na , m(:d(D , Mary ) gcard(D ,  1 ) ) sumce to distinguish a particular entity in Discourse  , 
State 0 from all the others).
Our approach extends naturally to cases like % he first snow drop of Spring " because it  ; is proof-theoretic and so able to exploit background knowledge in reference resolution  . This can be illustrated , in the first instance . , by exam-thing the backgrmmd knowledge which is used in updating the utterance " Mary slept  . " The update step for this utterance yields Discourse State  1  , contailfing ( amongst others ) the tbllow-ing facts :
Discourse State 1 , s/eep(#134)0(#134 , agent , #94) ends_before(#4(1) , #133) aspect ( simple , #13 a , #134) We were able to prove named (#94 , Mary ) and card (#94 , 1) and so dereference rcf ( , \ D(namcd(D , Mary ) & card(D ,  1 ) ) ) as the tbllowing were amongs the t~cts contained in Discourse State  0: 
Discourse State 0 female (#94) named (#94 , Mary ) woman (#94) f(# . 94) card (#94 ,  1 ) adult ( #94 ) These were generated from the lexical memfing1 ) ostulates we stipulated for " Mary " , " woman " , and " folnale ": 3X ( namcd(X , Mary ) & woman(X ) & card(X ,  1))

VX( . fcmalc ( X ) -4 f ( X ) )  3 Unfamiliar Referents In this section we show how  , within the framework above , we are able to make sense of a variety of referring expressions denoting unfamiliar referents  . The most straightt brward of these are bridging descriptions  , so we start with these . 
3 . 1 Bridging Descriptions ( 1 ) Mary loves her " moth , or . 
In this first case , " hermother " , contains a referring expression ested within it ; . Having deref-erenced this , the knowledge that moth , er of is a fllnction enables us to obtain a unique reli  ; renl ;  . 
Our representation of the referring expression to bederel brence d is as follows : " hermother " ref  ( AB ( of ( B ,   ,  . ef(a,1)$~f(G )))) ca . d(B ,  1 ) ) ) Tile first step involves anchoring tile referring expression by dereferencing its nested rethrring expression for " her  ''5  . 
' S The referent for this is characterised as salient_or_centred as we allow I  ) ossessiv c pronouns to be de referenced as an al ) hersor , failing that , as pronouns . 

Current Model ends_at_or_after(#4(1) , #135) aspect ( simple ,  #135 ,  #136) 0(#136 , agent ,  #94)

Tile partially constructed current discourse state we have when we do our dereferencing is as shown  . " Mary " has already been de referenced to #94 and this has been entered into the list of forward-looking centres fbr the current utterance  . We are able to prove both salient ( #94 ) and f ( #94 )   , and so our nested referring expression is dereibrenced to this entity  . 
ref(kB(of(B ,   , F ( , , , other(F )) ,  #94 ) card ( m1 ) ) ) It is then a straightt brward matter to de refer -ence the anchored referring expression  , given the tbllowing facts in Discourse State 0:
Discourse State 0 mother ( #60  ( #94 ) ) of ( #60 ( #94 )   , ; ~ A(moth . cr(A )) , #94) f(#60 (#94)) card(#60 (#94) ,   1 These derive from our nmaning postulates fbr " mother  ''6 and " of ":
VX((X isa , ~ i . , o , O ~ card(X , 1) - - ~ ~ Y(o . f(Y , k Z ( rnother(Z )) , X ) & card(Y , l ) & f(Y )))
VXVY VZ(of(X,Y,Z)-+Y.X)
Dealing with other bridging descrit ) tions is more complicated : ( 1 ) Mary sawahouse . 
(2) Shetbund the door.
In order to give an analogous treatment to the referring expression " the door "  , we have to treat it as elliptical tbranexl ) ression containing a nested referring expression , i . e . , " the door of the house " . In the same way that we have a meaning postulate for the relation mother of  , we have one for the relation door of : a Skolemization preserves dm dependency of Y on X  , i . e . , #94 is present in #60 (#94) . 
vx ( ( ho , , e(x ) v car(X )) qY ( of ( Y , AZ(door(Z )) , X ) ~ eard(Y , 1))) This means that , having used utterance ( 1 ) above to update the discourse model , we have the f bllowing amongst the facts in Discourse 
State 1:
Discourse State 1 seel (#138)0 (#138 , agent ,  #94) 0(#138 , object , #139) card(#139 , 1) house(#139) ends_be for'e(#4(1) ,  #sat ) door ( #46 ( #139 ) ) entrance (  #46 (  #139  )   ) of ( #46 ( #139 )  , ~ d(door'(A )) , #139) card(#46 (#139) , 1 aspect ( simple ,  #137 , #138) In updating utterance (2) , the bridging description which needs to be dere Drenced has the tbl-lowing representation : ref  ( AE ( door ( E ) g ~ card ( E ,  1 ) ) ) Since we caim ot guarantee that there will only be a single entity in our model satisfying the t  ) roperties kE ( door ( E ) & card ( E ,  1)) , we want to ensure that the referent we obtain is either the most recently mentioned or that with the most recently mentioned antecedent  , i . e . , in this case , the house #139 . Our ret > rence resolution t ) roce dur exploits the fact that the house ,  #139 , is explicitly represented in the forward looking centres of Discourse State  1 and that the intended referent ,  #46(#139) , is clearly a flmction of this ( its dependency having been preserved by Skolemization  )  . In considering the potential refbrents for our referring expression ill order of recency  , we attemp to prove , not simply , ibr each referent , X , whether door ( X ) and car'd(X ,  1) , but door ( V ) and card(Z , 1) where Y is a function of X . Since #46 ( #139 ) is a function of the antecedent #139 , we obtain the appropriate referent in this case by proving door  ( #46 ( #139 ) ) and card ( #46 ( #139 )  ,  1  . 
3.2 Superlatives
We are now in a I ) osition to describe our treatment of the superlatives discussed in the introduction  . First , we consider a case in which there is a discourse antecedent of sorts :  ( 2 ) The first man spoke . 
Discom:se State 1 contains the tbllowing facts :
Discourse State 1 arrive (#107)0 (#107 , agent ,  #1 . 08) card(#108,2)man(#108) male(#108) . ~(#108) adult(#108) ~ n&_b<l'o,'d#4(1),#106) a . s'pect( . simplc ,  #106 ,  #107 ) Our representation of the referring exi ) ression " the first man " is as follows : rcf ( k\]3 ( 'mo , s t(B , ~ C(early(C , AD(man(D )))) ,   ,  . ~f(~E ( , , , o , , , , (~)))) x ~,- . ., . d(u .  1))))
The nested referring expression ref(AE('m,a,'n . ( E ) ) ) )  ( ' m ~ be straightforwardly dereferenced in this case to give the anchored refi  ; rringexl ) ression : rcf(A\]3(mo , s t(B , ac ( ,  . ~,,+ . , j(c , . xu ( , . ., . ~( J ))))), #108) g, . .,,,,, . d(J3 ,  ~ ) ) ) ) Dereferencing this then involves our meaning postulate f i  ) r superlatives : V X V Z V C (  , - , , , , . d(Z,C ) ~( Z-X ) ~( ~ C = 1), ~
VN VP (- wnosl . ( X , P , _)-+~Y(mosl , ( Y , P , X ) & card(Y , N ) ) ) ) This siml ) ly says that t brany several to n set X , any property 1) and any N , there is some set Y containing the N " most P " members of X  . This meaning postulate does not translate into any facts in Discourse State  0  , lint remains as a rule . 
When we have a particula referring expression to derefhrence  , this rule enables us to prove that : most ( #81 ( kA ( early ( A ,  . . . )), 1, 2, #108, #108),, x(c(~,~, . ly(c,~D ( . ,,,,, . ,(D )))), #108) card(#81 ( AA(c'arly(A, .   .   .  ) )  ,  1 ,  2 ,  @ 108 ,  @ 108) , 1) In this way , we prove that the referring expression makes sense  , i . e . , denotes . However , unlike in the previous cases , we do not deret-erence to a familiar referent . There are no existing facts in the database about the referent  #81  ( AA ( early ( A ,  . . . )), 1, 2, @108, #108) . 
Instead , in this case , we have to add to Discourse State 2 the facts we have proved . 
Discourse state 2? . __spcalv (#112) th , cta(#112 , agent , #81 ( AA ( early ( A ,  . . . )), 1, 2, #108, #108)) end . s_before(#4(2),#11 . 1)  . spcech , A . imc(#4(2), 2) as pcct( . simplc , #111, #112) mo . st(#81 ( AA ( early(A, . . . )), 1, 2, #108, #108), ~ c(~o , , . z . .,j ( c , ~ D (,~ o,,4 D ) ) ) ), #108) ~,,~ . d(#Sl(~A(~o ,,@( A, . . . )), 1, 2, #108, #108), 1)~,,@(#81(~A(eo ,,@(A, . . . )) ,  1 ,  2 #108 ,  #108) , : ~ c ( , , , a , ~( c ))) , , , , , , , , , (#81(~A( , , , , , , . ly(A , .   .   . )) ,  1 ,  2 ,  #108 , #* O8)) mah'(#Sl(AA ( early(A ,   .   .   . )), 1, 2, #108, #108)) m(#Sl(AA ( early(A, .   .   .  ) )  ,  1 ,  2 ,  #108 ,  #108))  , , d , , , U , (#Sl(~A(~ , ,@(A ,  . . . )), 1, 2, #108, #108)) The fln:ther facts we . prove , about our refe . rent being e~rly , male , etc . , are required if we are to be aMe to subsequently ret b  . r to it using referring expressions such as " he " . The . seare generated from a set of associated memfing postulates : VX VY VP  ( (ordered ( P ) ~most ( Y , P , X )) -+ P . Y)
VA(ordered(AB ( early(B,A )))) vxvP ( , . ~o,, . 1,,(x,1,)-~p . x)
VX('m , an ( X ) ( Xish , uman ) ~male ( X ) &adult ( X ) ) vx ( mde ( x ) - ~ re ( x ) ) In addition to these , we have two further meaning postulates for superlatives : vxvY vev cvz  (   ,   ,   . o~t(Y , 1; X ), ~ a , . d(Y,C)g , , , os ~,( Z,P,X )* ~ a, . d(Z,C)-~z = Y )
VX VI'VY VN VC(most(X , P , Z ) & card(X , N ) ~ card(V , C ) - ~ ~ , ~ o ,  . ~( N , C )) tulate , states that if there are two subsets of of a set which share the same cardinality mid the same superlative property  , such as first , then they must be regarded as identical 7 . The second simply ensures that any mf familiar ret5r-ent which we obtain via our meaning postulates can sensibly regarded as a proper subset of its antecedent  ; hatis , it prevents us regarding " two men " as a potential antecedent of " the first men ":  ( 1 ) Two meni arrived . 
(2) The first men , f(i ) spoke.
Our treatment of superlatives without discourse antecedents is similar to that above  . 
(1) Mary sawth , c first snow & vps of

There is just one major difference.
r ' I(E
AF ( carly(F , : a(of(a ,   , \ It ( snow drop(It )) , ref ( ) , I(named(I , @ ri . .o ) g rd(Z , 1))))))), ref(),J(of(J , ( s o . o drop(K )) , ref(kL(named(L , Spring ) & card(L ,  1)))))))
E , VO )))
The representation we obtain for the referring expression " the first snow drops of Spring " is shown above  . Like that for " the first man " , this contains a nested referring expression : ref ( ) , g(of(J , 
AK(s now drop(K )), ~ card(L , 1)))))
The difference is that , in this case , there is no discourse antecedent for the nested referring expression  . This means that , in order to 7 practica Uy , this meaning postulate seems to be redundant . Our meaning postulates generate for us only one such subset and it is impossible for another to be introduced through the discourse as " a first man " is ungrammatical  . 
anchor our referring expression by dereferenc-ing the referring expression ested within it  , we need to introduce a meaning postulate for the nested referent  ( and one for its nested referent , 
Spring ): 3X(X , rd(X , 1)) qX(of(X , ))) & card(X , pl )   ) These meaning postulates simply introduce into Discourse State  0 the fact that there are snow-drops of Spring , in the same way that the meaning postulate for " Mary " introduced the fact that there is a singleton set containing an individuals on a med  . 
Discourse state 0 season (#98) named (#98 , Spring ) card (#98 , 1) extended (#98) snow drop (#101) of (#101 , A(A , snowdrop(A )) ,  #98)  . .(#101) card(#101 , pl ) Given the above facts in Discom'se State O , anchoring our referring expression is straightt br -ward  . 
f(E(.ost(E,1F ( early(F,C(of(a,
M t ( . snowdrop(H )) ,  #98)))) , #101)* car'd(E , P0))) From this point on wards , the proof that this referring expression denotes proeeeeds in the same way as in the previous example  . Given the meaning postulates for superlatives , we are able to prove : most (#81() , A(early(A ,  . . . )) , pl , pl ,  #101 ,  #101) , ~ D ( early(D , ) ~ E(of(E , ) ~ F ( snowdroI , ( F )) ,  #98)))) , #101) card(#81(~A ( ear'ly(A ,   .   .   .  ) )  , pl , pl ,  #101 ,  #101) , pl ) have proved concern an nut~miliar referent , and so have to 1 ) e added to the current discourse state .

Having made sense of such referring ext ) ressions , we add their referents to our discourse model . This is how we would normally deal with indefinites rather than definites  . However , thisal ) t ) roach makes t ) erfect sense , given our treatment of su ( ' h referring exl ) ressions as denoting unfamiliar subsets of familiar referents  ( regarded as sets )  . We claim that we are able to use definite descriptions to refer to the referents in question  , despite their unfamiliarity , SO long as we C all prove that , by virtue of their meaning , they denote uniqnely . 
Having imt ) lemented our approach in a system of language understanding which already deals with a wide variety of referring expressions  , we have demonstrated its practicality . 
It also has interesting theoretical implications , since it suggests a way in which pragmatic theories of reference resolution  , like Familiarity Theory , and semantic theories , like Russell's , may be reconciled . However , it is fair to say that the success of the approach is not yet proven  . 
This is because we have yet to show that we can deal with a set of related referring expressions within a single fi'a mework  . The following example illustrates the kinds of cases we have in mind :  ( 1 ) Three meniate . 
(2) Two menj slept.
(3) The first menidied.
Here , " first " in " the first men " is clearly per -t brming a dit\[erent  , discourse-related flmction from that it plws in the cases we have been considering  . We have yet to tackle such difficult cases but , since they seem to require reasoning about sets , we believe that our inference-based approach to reference resolution is a good place to start  .
