Preparation , recording , segmentation adpitch labelling of Slovenian diphone inventories are described  . A special user friendly intert'ace package was developed in order to facilitate these operations  . As acquisition of a labelled diphone inventory or adaptation of a speech synthesis ystem to synthesise further voices is manually intensive  , an automatic procedure is required . A speech recogniser , based on Hidden Markov Models in forced segmentation mode is used to outline phone boundaries within spoken logatoms  . A statistical evaluation of manual and automatic segmentation discrepancies i performed so as to estinmte the reliability of automatically derived labels  . Finally , diphone boundaries are determined and pitch markers are assigned to voiced sections of the speech signal  . 
1 Introduction
For the Slovenian language , several attempts were made in the past , where different aspects of a Slovenian text-to -speech synthesis  ( TI'S ) system were covered ( Dobnikar 95 )  . Nevertheless , none of them succeeded in building a complete system  , providing high quality synthetic speech . In the Laboratory of Artificial Pemeption , we started on text-to-speech synthesis one year ago  ( Gros 96 )  . Here we describe the acquisition of an appropriate diphone inventory in a first version of our Slovenian TTS system  , which is supposed to serve as a reference system for future improvements  . 
We start with a brief overview of the different modules el ' the Slovenian TTS system  , then we go on to describe how the existing diphone inventory was obtained  . The acquisition eralabelle diphone inventory or adaptation of a speech synthesis ystem to synthesis e new voices is manually intensive and prone to errors  , therefore automatic procedures are required ( Tay-lor 91 , Sehmidt 93 , Cosi 91 , Ottesen93) . In section 4 we * This work was partly funded by the Commission of the European Community under  COP-94 contract No 01634   ( SQEL ) explain how we intend to automatically derive additional diphone inventories for building new synthetic voices  . 
2 Slovenian TTS system
Tile different phases of the text-to-speech transformation are performed by separate independent modules  , operating sequentially , as shown in Figure 1 . Thus input text is gradually transformed into its spoken equivalent  , 
Graphemc-to-phoneme transcription
First , abbreviations are expanded to t'orn lequivalent full words using a special list of lexical entries  . A text preprocessor converts further special formats  , like numbers or dates , into standard graphemic strings . Next , word pronunciation is derived , based on a user extensible pronunciation dictionary and letter-to-sound rules  . The dictionary is supposed to cover the most fl ' equent words in a given hmguage and a second dictionary helps with pronouncing proper names  . 
Prosody generation
Prosody generation assigns the sequence of allophones with some of their prosodic parameters  ( pitch l ' requency , duration ) . First , words are syllabitied by counting then mn be r of their vowel clusters and duration of syllables is modelled according to the speaker's normal articulation rate  , depending on the number of syllables within a word and on the word's position within a phrase  . Then , segmental prosodic parame-te ~ w are determined tbr each all ophone on the basis of the accent position within a word and its type  . Finally , the global intonation contour of a phrase is determined  ( Sor in 87 )  . 
Diphone Concatenation
Once the appropriate phonetic symbols and prosody markers are determined  , the final step is to produce audible speech by assembling elemental speech units  , computing pitch and duration contours , and synthe-sising the speech waveform . A concatenative TD-PSOLA diphone synthesis technique was used  , allowing high-quality pitch and duration transformations directly on the waveform  ( Moulines 9 ( / )  .

diphone inventory cotn prising 955 pitch-labelledi-phones was created . In order to guarantee optimal synthesis quality , a neutral phonetic on text in which the diphones needed to be located  , was speeitied . Un-favourable positions , like insidestressed syllables or in over-a , ticulated contexts , were excluded . The di-phones were placed in the middle of logatoms  , pronounced with a steady intonation . The exception is in the case where the silence phone is part of the required pair : there the diphone was word initial or word final  . 
Speech signals were recorded by a close talking nil-crophone using a sampling rate of  16 kHz and 16 bitlinear AID conversion . 
3 Slovenian Diphone Inventory
In concatenation systems , both the choice and the proper segmentation of the traits to be concatenated play a key role  . Acoustic differences between stored and requested segments  , its well as acoustic discontinuities at the boundaries belween adjacent segments have to be minimised  . Dipt , one units are most corn- . 
monly adopted as a compromise between the size of the unit inventory and tile quality of synthetic speech  . 
A diphoncis , generally speaking , a unit which starts in timmidd leo1: one phone , passes through the transi~tion to the next phone and ends in the middle of this next phone  . So the transition between two phones is encapsulated and does notueed to be calculated  . 
Yet it is not clear whether speech segment should be extracted from nonsense plurisyllabic words  , called Iogatoms , existing isolated words or meaningful sen-teuces . Even the question of a bust position in go I ' the units within the spoken corpus is still widely debated  . Stressed syllables are longer , thus less submitted to coarticulation , which results in easily chainable units ; while unstressed ones are more ntnnerous in natural speech  , so that producing them efficiently would both increase segmental q t  , ality and reduce lrlcmory requirements . Likewise , coarticulalions are strongly subject ospeaker's lluency  , so that imposing a slow speaking rate results in more intelligible units  . To a large extent these issues are part of a necessary tradeoff between intelligibility and naturalness  . 
One diphone to revery all ophone combination possible in a given language is required  . A Slovenian Iqgure 2: Wawqbrm ( above ) and spectral ( below ) representation of the diphone ac . Markers 1 , and R are set at the pitch periods ~" the left part of the do  , hone and of the right part , respectively . 
After the recording phase , logatoms were hand-segmented and tile center of tile transition between tile phones was marked  , using information from both temporal and spectral representation ftile speech sipnal  . A special user-friendly interface was developed for this purpose  , allowing editing , scaling , viewing , llt-belling and pitch-marking of the speech signal  , t , ' irst the approxium teneighbourhood of a diphone was determined  , then a fine labelling of its boundaries was performed and the center of the phoneme transition was marked  , l " in all y , pitch markers were manually set for voiced parts of tile corresponding speech signal  .

used a set of 34 symbols for all ophones , which we adapted to the SAMPA standard requirements  ( Fourcin 89 ) t . 
While concatenating diphones into words it suddenly turned out that there was a large discrepancy between the duration of all ophones  , as suggested by the prosody module , and the actual corresponding diphone duration stored in the diphone inventory  . This happened due to the exaggerated agerness of the speaker trying to pronounce the meaningless logatoms in a correct and clear way  . Consequently , the quality of the synthetic speech was considerably affected and we are therefore planning to record another diphone inventory  . As the transformation range for prosodic speech parameters needed for synthesising naturally sounding speech is large  , the recording should thus be carefully controlled to achieve medium pitch and duration va-lues  . 
4 Automatic Diphone Segmentation
Automatic speech segmentation procedures are power -fill tools for including new synthetic voices and for updating and supplementing existing diphone libraries whereas manual diphone segmentation is atedious  , time consuming task , prone to errors . The relbre , in order to be able to synthesis espeech in a variety of different voices  , we decided to use procedures for automatic segmentation adpitch marking of spoken logatoms  . 
The extraction of diphones from the recorded words is performed in two stages  . The first stage is the phoneme segmentation of logatoms  , yielding a start point , transition center and endpoint for each phone . 
The second part of the diphonextraction procedure is to find the concatenation point of each phone  . 
~ A list of Slovenian SAMPA symbols together with their audio samples is available on the WWW on the address "  http:#1uz  . fer . uni-lj . si/english/SQEL/sampa-eng . htlnl" . 
Finally , pitch markers are to be determined for voiced parts of the signal  . We intend to apply the SRPD ( Super Resolution Pitch Determination ) algorithm as it allows precise pitch determination  ( Medan 91 )  . 
Hidden Markov Model Phone Segmentation
To solve the segmentation problem , methods for stochastic modelling of speech are used  . Hidden Markov Models ( HMMs ) are stochastic finite-state automata that consist of a finite number of states  , mo-delling the temporal structure of speech , and a probabilistic function for each of the states  , modelling the emission and observation of acoustic feature vectors  ( Rabiner 89 )  . 
To perform logatom segmentation we used the Is a dora system  , developed at the University Erlangen-Nuremberg ( Schukat92 )  . The Isador a system is a tool used for modelling of one dimensional patterns  , like speech . It consists of modules for speech signal feature extraction  , hard or soft vector quantization and beam search driven Viterbi training and recognition  . 
The ls'adora system builds a large network of nodes that correspond to different speech events like phones  , phonemes , words or sentences . The nodes are provided with a dedicated HMM in order to acoustically represent the corresponding speech event  . 
For system training , approximately half an hour of continuou speech recorded from a single speaker is required along with its orthographic transcription  . The acoustical analyser delivers every milise cond a set of Melfi'equency cepstral coefficients along with their slopes plus the energy of each frame  . A phone level description is obtained using the orthographic transcription and a pronunciation dictionary  . In the initialisation step the feature vectors are classified into  64 classes using a soft vector quantization technique  . Using a phonetically a belled vocabulary a BaumWelch training procedure is applied  , and parameters of mono-

Due to the properties ot : the Slovenian language some phones are composed of several phone components  , like the stop consonants k , p , b , d , t and the affricates c and & Such phones are described by multiple submodels  . Table I gives the Slovenian phones and their corresponding submodels as they are used li  ) r logatom segmentation . 
A preliminary statistical evaluation of mantml and automatic segmentation discrepancies was performed on a much larger speech database than the logatom inventory itself as proposed in  ( Schmidt 93 )  .   150 spoken sentences were extracted fi'om the Slovenian speech corpus GOP OI  , IS ( l ) obrigek96 ) concerning air flight time table inquiries in total duration of  25 minutes . Average duration , conlidence interwtl and standard evi-ation of the population for both manual and automatic segmentation are presented in Table  2  . 
The discrepancies between manual and automatic segmentation are considerable  . Most of the problems arise when detecting bursts of plosives a stile automatic procedure tends to shorten their closures considerably  . 
The situation improves when plosives are taken as a whole  , closures and bursts together . 
As a result , a fully automatic seglnentation fspeech segments i hardly conceivable in the context of concatenation synthesis  . As most phonological units originate via phonological considerations rather than on acoustic grounds  , isolating them requires a deep prior knowledge of their specilic features  . Unsupervised segmentation , i . e . segmentation on acoustic principles only , often results in segments and subsegments boundaries being misplaced  , or just missing , while undefined ones appear . However , it can be used as a segmentation outline , the retinement of which has to be performed by a human expert  .

Thus automatic procedures can speedup the segmentation process  , but they are not likely to suppress manual corrections  , at least for obtaining highest synthesis quality with a given corpus  . 
Diphone boundaries determination
As the concatenation point of the diphones corresponds to the center of the phone  , it is somewhere in the steady region of the phone  . By studying the distances from the signal to the target values  ,   ( Ottesen 91 ) claims that minimal distances tend to be just before the middle of the phoneme  . We decided to divide each phone meduration in a fixed ratio  , 40 and 60% . Plo-sives are exception to this rule : they are divided just in front of the opening burst  . A diphone boundary detection algorithm , minimising spectral discontinuities at concatenation points  ( Taylor 91 ) may be investigated . 
5 Conclusion
Diphone inventory acquisition for the Slovenian language was discussed  . In order to avoid the tedious time consuming manual segmentation flog atoms  , an automatic procedure , based on HMM models is considered . Thus diphone sets for new synthetic voices are easier to produce  . Results of the statistical evaluation of manual and automatic segmentation discrepancies are given  . 
We expect he whole process of creating a new wfice to be semiautomatic  ( with manual correction of stop-consonant boundaries  )  , allowing the synthesiser to be retrained on a new voice in less than  3 days .
