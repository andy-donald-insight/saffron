1 Introduction
Analogies between strings of symbols , noted jA:B = C:\]) , put four strings of symbols into " proportions . " They render an account of , for instance , look : looked=walk:walkedorfablc: fabulous = miracle : miraculous  , ontlhelevel of strings of symbols . They are not intended to deal directly with , for instance , bird:wings=fish:finsor work:worked=go : went which suppose knowledge about the world or the tongue  ( II of l ? nan 95 )  . Analogies may be read as equalities , as well as equations to be solved , as in : to looh : I look cd = to act : x~x = l act cd The goal of this paper is to establish some \[' undamental  , common sense hypotheses ( axioms ) about analogies in general ; then to draw from them basic results ( theorems ) on analogies between strings of symbols in particula  . r ; so as to propose a possible definition tbr \] ~ ngua  . ges of analogical strings ; and to prove that some famous bmguages of particular interest othe language processing community are very simple languages in this respect  . We further argue that the fact that the property of bounded grow this verified by ~ ny such language is in favour of modelling part of naturalanguage using such languages  . 
Our feeling is that analogy between strings of symbols is an operation as Nndamental as  , e . g . , addition is to natur M numbers . I lowever , to our knowledge , letting aside the Copy cat project ( Hofstadter et el . 94, Chap . 57, pp .  195 318 ) which has no such goals and relies on different methods  , no mathematical formalisation has ever been proposed t brana Jogies between strings of symbols  . 
lln the sequel , A , B , C and D are variablcs denoting objects . 
2 General Properties of Analogy
We start with results which \] told independently of the set to which the terms of the ~ malogy belong  . 
2.1 Fundamental Hypotheses
In the Nicoma . chean E thics ( Book V ) , Aristotle wrote : For proportion is equality of ra  . tios , and involves four terms at least \ [ . . . \] As the term A , then , is to \]1 , so will C be to D , a . nd therefore , alternando , as A is to C , B will be to D . 
\[ Translation by W.1). Ross \]
As a consequence , we shall hypothesize the following property :
Axiom 1 ( Ex change of the means )
A : B = C : D ~ A : C = B : I)
Another equivalence is also used by Aristotle in his Poetics  . It is based on the symmetry of the equality ( the word " as , " here ) : if we can say that A is to B as C is to D , then we should also be able to say that C is to D as A is to B  . 
Axiom 2 ( Symmetry of equality)
A : B = C : D ~ C : D = A : B 2 . 2 Equivalent Forms of Analogy By successive application of the previous hypotheses  , we get eight equiva . lent forms of the same a . m  ~ logy , listed hereafter in the alphabet order of the term variables A  , B , Ca . ndD . 
Theorem 1 ( Equivalent forms ) The eight following analogies are equivalent :
A : C = ( ii ) 11: A = I ) : C ( iii ) ~ ii + vi + ii
B : D = A : (/( iv ) ~ iii + ii
C : A = D : B(v ) <= i i + i i i(v , ,: )  / ) : B = C : A ( vii ) <=- ii + vi + iii D : ( 7 = H : A ( ' viii ) ~ iii-tviSOllle interesting results may I ) eel ) rained on the number of different l ) ossible analogy classes given four ol ) j ex : ts , l lowever , we shall leave them aside : for lack of spa ( ; e .

A:\]~--C:D~IAI+I~)I = I~I+IC l3 . 5 Dis jo int Analogies Another intuitive idea about analogies between strings of symbols is that two analogies could always be concatenated  . Whether this is true remains an open problem . 
lIowever , the previous intuition seems to hold anyway when the two an Mogies to be concatenated do not have any symbol in common  . We cMl such analogies , disjoint analogies . The intuition is that , disjoint analogies : m~y be applied one after another without any problem  .   \]3ut concatenating in the same order is not the only p ossibility  . 
Onegets 2   4  =  16 analogies by enumerating all possibilities of exchanging or : not exchanging the substrings indexed by I a  . : nd2 in A1A2:B1B2 = CIC2: DID2 . By numbering these 16 a . ualogies using a binary notation reflecting the place where this exchange took place  , numbers which are binm : y complements denote two equivalent analogies  , of which one may be eliminated from the list . We list hereafter those analogies with A1A2 as a first term .

D 1 The number of di Iferent cases is further reduced using  ( i )  ?>  ( viii ) of the Equiw > lent tor , ns : ( ooo: , )  , ~( ~ ooo ) ~ ,  ((/~: , ~ ) and ( 00\]0 )  ~  ( 0100 ) ? The reduced set is: ( 0000 )  ,  (000\] ) ,  (00\]0) , (00\] l ) ,  (0101) ,  (0110)  . 
Similarly , ( i ) ? :> ( ii ) of the Equivalent brn , s yields the equivalences : ( 0010 )  ~  ( 0100 ) and ( 00 ll )  ~  ( 0101 ) ? The reduced set becomes: ( oooo )  , ( ooo ~) , ( oo:l: , ) , ( o:1: , o ) . 
Of the set burpossible analogies , the second one ,  (0001) , where only one exchange is performed , is not true in genera . l . For instance , ay : az = by : x is not acceptable when x = zb .

This language is famous for being the basis of two counterexamples against the context-freeness of natural anguage : in the morphology of Bambara  ( Culy 85 )  , and in the syntttx of the Zurich dialect of Swiss German  ( Shieber 85 )  . 
5.2 Bounded Growth
Following the discussion about the non-context -freeness of natural anguage  , the family of tbr-real languages that can be used to formalise natural language has been though to be necessarily larger than the family of contextfree languages  , but it does not have to cover all context -sensitive languages  , as some context-sensitive languages are obviously not relevant for natural languages  . Mild cont cxt , sensitivity was thus proposed by ( Joshi 85 ) to characterise the family of languages captured by tree-adjoining grammars  ( larger than contextfree , but strictly smaller than context-sensitive ) . 
However , this is a characterisation by a recognition device  , and some have proposed other intrinsic characterisations  . ( Marcus & al . 96) have been advocating that , the keypoint in " mild context sensitivity " is the property of bounded growth : for each sentence in a language  , we can always find another sentence in the same language whose length differs t!l:om the length of the first sentence by at most a given constan t  . 
Definition 4 ( Bounded growth ) Ala'n-guage ? has the bounded growth property if  ( and only ~' ) ? is a single to nor 3k EIN/Now , it is easy to prove ( see Appendix ) that : Theorem 7 Any language of analogical strings verifies the bounded growth property  . 
Consequently , a language like a2'~/n CIN is not a language of analogical strings , as it does not have the bounded growth property . Lucldly thus , some " unnatural " languages are out of the reach of languages of analogical strings  . 
6 Conclusion
Only as ln all number of proposals have been made t br the modelisation of analogy  , the rare exceptions being ( It konen 8: I laukioja 97 ) and , out of linguistics , ( Hofsta . dter et al94), may be because the dominant strea . min linguistics for years , tile generative one , against works by the founders of modern linguistics  ( e . g . ( Sans-sure J6, Part 1II , Chap .  4 & 5)) , explicitly rebutted analogy as a possible object of research  ( see ( It konengz naukioja 97 , 7132 and 136) , for quotations from Chomsky ) under the fallacious pretext that blind application of analogy may lead to falsity in logic and agra  . mmaticality in syntax , l to wever , following recent results in experimental psychology and refuta  . tions of the innateness hypothesis ( It konen 94) , analogy nlay reasonably be argued to be a component in language  ( of course , surely not the only one ) . 
l laving posited only l burfund an mntal hypotheses on analogy  , we have shown how to generate afmnily of formal languages  , called languages of analogical strings . It is important onote that analogical string grammars  , like simple contextual grammars ( llie 96) , do not lnake any use of nonterminals . Crammaticality is s in \] ply tested against some attested strings  , after reduction according to some models . The a . pproach by reductiol ~ to attested\['orms has already heen advocated in natural anguage processing  ( Sager 81 )  . 
The key language a '% ' ~ c "~ d ' ~/ n > l against the context-freeness hypothesis of natural language is easily shown to be a language of analogical strings  . Also , all languages of analogical strings possess the bounded growth property  , which attempts to capture mild context sensitivity  , a notion introduced to cope with the apparent power of human languages  . 
The fact that the regular language a ' ~ , the contextfree language a %' ~ , and the context-sensitive language a ~ b~c ' ~ are very similar  1 an-guages of analogical strings shows that analogy allows us " to get round " the Chomsky classiti-cation  .
