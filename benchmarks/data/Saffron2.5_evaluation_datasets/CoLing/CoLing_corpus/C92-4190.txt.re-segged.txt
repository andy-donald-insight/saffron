The adverb is the most complicated , and perhaps also the most interesting part of speech  . 
Past research in natural anguage processing , however , has not dealt seriously with adverbs , though linguists have done significant work on this word class  . The current paper draws on this linguistic research to organize an adverbial lexicon which will be useful for information retrieval and natural language processing systems  . 
1 . INTRODUCTION the semantic and syntactic properties of these different classes of adverbs  . 
In this study , we give some indication of how a sophisticated and well structured adverbia lexicon can help NLP systems to handle adverbs  . Our lexicon builds on the work of several linguists  . Their work has helped us to organize information about adverbs from the Collins English Dictionary  ( CED ) and other sources . The adverbial lexicon is organized using the Oracle Relational Database 
Management System.
There have been many studies on nouns , verbs , and adjectives in NLP systems . Adverbs have received far less attention . 
It is very difficult for natural language processing  ( NLP ) systems to handle adverbs because of the large number of syntactic roles that adverbs can assume in sentences  . Adverbs can modify verbs , adjectives , adverbs , clauses , or the whole sentences . Adverbs obey complicated positional and selectional restrictions  . Many adverbs change meanings when they change their positions in sentences  . 
Despite this complexity , linguists have made significant progress developing a comprehensive set of adverbs classifications  , and elucidating * This research was partially supported by the National Science Foundation under grant  IRI-8704619  . Our thanks also to Collins Publishers to t permission to use the dictionary tapes  . 
Semantic classes of adverbs and selectional restrictions are discussed in Section  2  . Section 3 treats functional classes and describe some of the properties of certain functional classes of adverbs  . Section 4 present some possible applications . Finally,
Section 5 concludes.
2. SEMANTICCLASSIFICATION OF
ADVERBS ANDSELECTIONAL

With minor variations , Jacobson\[1964\] and Quirk et al\[1985 ,   p438-74\] classify adverbs semantically as : adverbs of time  , manner , degree , location , direction , transition and hedges . Adverbs of time , for example , answer questions such as " When ? , "" How often ? , " " How long ? . "Some examples of adverbs in this class are " before  , "" during , "" now , "" for ever , " seldom , " etc . Adverbs of manner answer questions like " How ?" and " In what manner  ( way ) ? " Examples are " quickly , "AcrEsDECOLING . .92, NANTES , 2328 AO~r 1992 1 i 9 2 PROC . OFCOLING-92, NANTES , AU?I .  2328 . 1992" like , "" together , " and " without . " Hedges indicate fuzzy restrictions such as " essentially  , "" sort of , " and " virtually "\[ Lakoff ,  1972\] . 
We have classified adverbs by systematically analyzing CED definitions  . 
More details on this process can be found in Conlon et al  , \[1990\] and Pin-Ngern\[1990\] . 
These semantic classes are stored in our adverbial lexicon as in Table  1  . 
ADV_CED(_W__QR ~ , H/G# , E ~_I ~ S__F ~ , 8 UBSENSE # , SEMANTIC CLASS ) about 12 lDEGREE , TIME actually 111 MOOD between 122 PLACE , DIRECTION down 1   2   7 POSITION evidently 1   1   1 MOOD Table 1  . Adverb classification from CED The first line indicates that in CED  , the adverb " about " with homograph number 1 , sense number 2 , and subsense number 1 belongs to the flggr ~ and time class . ( To facilitate x position , the tables here and below are not normalized . )
Huang \[1975\] provides a similar classification of adverbs based on semantic usage with verbs  . These classes of adverbs include :
State of ~ ~ . Adverbs in this group indicate a participant's state of mind  . 
Examples are ~ and ~ in the following sentences :
Herf_aLf . Ra~stepped into the room.
Mary was F_JllLegl2 taken advantage of ...
vA . d . x . cz  ~ . These adverbs express an evaluation of the actor 's participation i the event such as " clumsily " in " He clumsily stepped on the snail  . " of \] ~5 . UR . These describe aspects of the result of an event such as the adverb " correctly " in the sentence " Hespelled the words correctly  . "
Huang's classifications can also be incorporated into Table  1  . 
These adverb classifications can be extremely useful to NIP systems  , in particular , in the statement of selectional restrictions ( or preferences )  . Huang describes a number of selectional restrictions between adverbs and other parts of speech  . Some examples are : Adverbs of manner or direction can modify verbs of motion  . 
Adverbs of result are proper to accomplishment and achievement verbs  . 
Time and locative adverbs usually occur in action sentences and specify the temporal and spatial circumstances of the events  . 
Degree adverbs express the degree or extent of a certain quality or state and presuppose an analysis of grading properties in the semantics of adjectives in particular  . 
Conjunctive adverbs are used in almos the same way as conjunctions  . 
This type of information should help text generation systems to select appropriate types of adverb to suit nouns  , verbs , adjective , and adverbs which have already been chosen . 
It may also be useful for resolution of ambiguity in natural anguage understanding applications  ( ee Radford\[1988 ,   p372\] for an example of a sentence in which selectional restrictions resolve ambiguity  )  . Information about selectional restriction are stored as in 
Table 2.

From the above examples , "clumsily " and " slowly " can modify dynamic verbs and action sentences  . 
3. FUNCTION ALCLASSIFICATION
AND THE SYNTACTIC BE HAVIOR OF

Jacobson \[1964\] groups adverbs into four major functional classes : modifying adverbs  ( " L . I /? . . . ~ heis ~ careful ") , complementary adverbs (" Please come ~') , referentiald verbs (" This section , in particular , is important ") , and conjunctive adverbs ( " He will not leave unless heaskshim to " )  . 
Adverbs that function as modifiers , in turn , can modify verbs (" Hespelled r , ~_rLeC ~") , adjectives (' They are ~ tall ") , other adverbs (" He works ~ well ") , or even clauses and the whole sentences ( " For Cunat ? ly he was not drunk " )  . 
These functional casses help to organize knowledge representation schemes involving adverbs  , and are also essential for understanding the syntactic properties of adverbs  . Jackendoff , for example , classifies adverbs as subject-oriented , speaker-oriented ( sentence ) , and manner adverbs , and represents the meaning structures of these adverbs in essentially prolog form as follows : 
Adverb class : Sentence
Prolog-like formula : ADJ(f(Np1, . . . , NP a))
Example : EVIDENT(WALKED(JOHN,IN))
It is evident hat John walked in.
Evidently , John walked in.
Adverb class : Subject-oriented
Prolog-like formula : ADJ(Npi , f(NP 1.....NP a))
Example : CLUMSY(FRED,
DROPPED(FRED , THEBOOK))
It was clumsy of Fred to drop the book.
Clumsily , Fred dropped the book.
Adverb class : Manner
Prolog-like formula :\[ f/ADV\](Np1,...,NPn)
Example:\[RAN/QUICKLY\](SUE , HOME)
Sue quickly ran home.
Figure 1.
Huang uses similar prolog-like formulas to represent the semantic structure of adverbs  . 
This same functional classification also allows Jackendoff to derive positions of adverbs by using parse trees  . According to Jackendoff , sentence adverbs must be attached to an S-node , while manner adverbs are attached to VP nodes . Thus the sentence adverb " evidently " can appear in position such as the following : 

ADV NP VP

VPP
Evidently John walked in the store.
Figure 2.

NP ADV VP
VPP " d1 walked in the store . John evlenty
Figure 3.
A similar parse tree could be constructed for " John walked in the store  , evidently . " On the other hand , the sentence *' John walked evidently in the store  , " is impossible because the parse tree does not allow " evidently " to be attached to the S node  ( see figure 4 . )
NP ~ VP
VADVPP * John walked evidfly to the store
Figure 4.
For a similar discussion , see McCawley\[1988 , p631=40\] and Radford\[1988 , p73 ,  93\] . 
Classification of adverbs by functional class is g wen in tables such as Table  3  . 
ADV_MODW (_WQ_~_,H_H_LC.~,SENS ~,
SUBSENSE# , MODIFYING_CLASS ) evidently 111 sentence happily 111 sentence , speaker , manner clumsily 111 subject , manner
Table 3. Classifications of Modifying
Adverb Based on Modification Class
Additional information about adverbial positions in sentences has been collected by Ja cobson  \[1964\]  . This information should supplement the information in Table  3  , and should also be helpful for information retrieval and NLP applications  . This information is organized as in Table 4 . 
ADV-JACOBSON(~_,H/G#,SENS ~ ,

Collected by Jaeobson
Thus , " constantly " is found in " middle " and " end " positions  . More details about each position can be found in Jacobson  \[1964\]  . 
4. APPLICATIONS
A sophisticated a verbial lexicon should help NLP systems to handle adverbs appropriately  . 
NLP systems will be able to use information in the adverbial lexicon in parsing  , language understanding , and text generation systems . 
Suppose , for example , that a parser has to parse a sentence of the form : " John\[Adv\]walked to the store  . " The parser can determine how to treat the adverb by looking in the lexicon to see whether the adverb is a sentence or a verb phrase adverb  . For example , if " quickly " is the adverb in the sentence , it is a manner adverb , so it should be attached to the verb or verb phrase node  . On the other hand , if the adverb is " evidently " then it is a mood adverb  ( speaker oriented sentence modifier )  , and so , should be attached to the S node . 
ACRESDE COLING-92 , NAN ll~S , 2328 AO~'19921195 t'ROC . O1: COLING-92, NANTES , AUG .  2328 ,   1992 Once the sentence has been successfully parsed , the language understanding system can then create prolog-like formulas of the form indicated in Figure  1  . Similarly , the text generation system should be designed to take prolog-like formula such as those in Figure  1 and successfully translate them into natural language  . The functional class then places restrictions on the position of the adverbs  , as in
Figures 2, 3, and 4.
Finally , selectional restrictions can be used to reduce lexical ambiguity in language understanding systems  , and assist in word choice in text generation ( see Section 2 )  . 
5. CONCLUSION
NLP systems can handle adverbs , if the adverbia lexicon provides enough relevant information with appropriate knowledge representation techniques  . The tables in our lexicon include , among others , Table 1: Semantic classifications of each adverb . 
Table 2: Selectional restrictions.
Table 3: Modifying class ( sentence , speaker , manner , etc . ) . 
Table 4 . Jacobson's dictionary of adverb placement . 
This adverbia lexicon can be used in combination with Tables for other parts of speech to implement NLP systems  . 
These tables , with others , should allow NLP systems to break down the intimidating complexity of the adverb class  , and so , handle parsing of sentences with adverbs , adverb placement , knowledge representation related to adverbs , and selectional restrictions between adverbs and other parts of speech  .
