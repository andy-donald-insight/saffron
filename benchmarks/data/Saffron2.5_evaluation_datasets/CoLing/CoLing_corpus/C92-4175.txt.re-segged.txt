Abstract
This paper proposes the use of situation theory as a basic semantic formalism for defining general semantic theories  . ASTL , a computational situation theoretic language , is described which goes some way to offering such a system  . After a general description of Discourse Representation Theory an encoding of DRT in ASTL is given  . Advantages and disadvantages of this method are then discussed  . 
Topie : computational formalisms in semantics and discourse 

T be pn rpose of this paper is to show how a computation a language based on situation theory can be used as a basic formalism ill which genera \] semantic theories can be implemented  . There are many different semantic theories which , because of their different notations , are difficult to compare . A general language which allows those theories to be implemented within it would offer an envirolnnent where similar semantic theories could be more easily evaluated  . 
Situation Theory ( ST ) has been developed over the last ten years \[2\] . Much work has been done in both tlle formal aspects of situation theory and its use in natural anguage semantics  ( situation semantics )  , however so far little work has been dramill its computational aspects  . It is the eventual goal of tile work presented here to show how situation theory can be used computationally and how a computational situation theoretic language call provide an enviromnent ill which different semantic theories call I  ) e easily compared . 
Because there are so many variants of ST we must define our own here  . The language ASTL\[3\] has been defined . Althong bit uses surprisingly few features of situation theory  , it seems powerful enough to act as a basic language for semantics  . It has been considered that somcextension to " classical " feature structures be made and use those to encode semantic forms  . Features systems augmented with set vahms , eyclicity and other extensions may be powerful enough but the method described here takes an existing semantic theory and refines it rather than building a new one  . 
This paper is ba.sically split into two sections.
Tlw first discusses how ST can be used in a computational system  , and introduces the language ASTL . 
The second half of this paper discusses Discourse Representation Theory  ( DRT ) as a theory in itself and shows how it can be encoded with ASTL  . 
ST and Computation
The view according to situation theory is that parts of the " world " can be described as situations  . Sit-uations support facts . Facts can be true , false , or undefined in some situation . A fact's truth value may be different in different situations  . Situations are tirst class objects in the theory , and hence they can be used as arguments to facts so that relations can be defined between situations  . Situations are useful in translations for naked infinitives  ( e . g . 
" see " ) Situations make ST different from more conventional logical theories although there have been proposals to add situation-like objects to more classical theories like Montagne grammar  \[8\]  . 
As well as situations and partiality , situation theory offers many otheriutensional objects  , including abstractions , types , and parameters ( partially determined objects ) . These form a rich for-realism for describing semantic phenomena  . However these features alone do not constitute a computational system  , with tile addition of constraints and rules of inference we call have the basis for a computatimlal system  . The idea of a computational situation theoretic language has been con-sider cdelse where  . Most notable is the language PRosv\[' \[9\] which offers a Prolog-like language based on situation theory rather than first order logic  . Other systems ( e . g .  \[5\] ) allow the representation of situations etc . within some other formalism ( e . g . feature structures ) but do not use situation theory itself as the basis for the language  . 

ASTL is a language based on situation theory . It takes a very conscrvative view of situation theory  , admitting only some basic parts . Although ASTL may need to be extended later , it already can be used to describe simple versions of semautic theories  ( such ms situation semantics and DRT )  . Rather than use , or extend , PROSlT it was decided to develop a new language . ASTL includes stone built-ill support for natural language parsing based on tile ideas of Situation Theoretic Grammar  \[4\] while PRoslrr is designed more for knowledge representation than direct language processing  . 
ASTL allows the following basic terms :
Individuals : e.g.a,b,c.
Parameters : e.g . X,Y , Z.
Variables : e.g .* X ,* g,*Z .
Relations : e . g . see/2 . Relation name and arity . 
i-terms : consisting of a relation , arguments and a polarity (0 or 1) , e . g . < < sing , h , 1 > > . 
AcrEsDECOLING-92 , NANTES , 2328 Ao~r19921l16PROC . OFCOLING-92, NANTES , AUG .  2328 ,   1992 tylms : consisting of an abstractiol low ! r propositions  . For example \[ S!S !~< < aing , h,l > >
S ! ~<< aoe , h,S,l >>\]
That is tile type of situation which supports the fact that hsings and h sees that situation  . 
Sitnatirms : written , as names optionally followed by a type . e . g . 
SI::\[T!T!-<<rua , t,l > >\].
$2::\[S!S !~< < uee , ii , Sl , l >>\].
tn addition to terms there are the following sen -tc~tccs : Propositions : consisting of a situation and a type e  . g . 
Sitl:\[S ! s !~< < ~ oe , c , l > >
S ! ~<< dance , l >>\]
Constraints : are det lncd betweel li ) ropositions , dmy coasist of a proposition following by <= l bllowed by a list of l  ) ropositio as . For examp h ~ Sltl:\[S!s !~< < happy , h , l >>\] < ~ Sitl:\[S!S!~<<smile , it , l >>\] . 
The selnantics of ASTI , ( delin , ~dfullyill\[3\] ) are delined in terms of a model consisting of individuals  , relalions , parameters , situations slid a set coasist-ing of pairs of situations and facts  , lnf flrmally , a proposition is true if the denotation of the situation supports all of the facts in the type  . A constraint is true if when all the propositions in the right hand side of the constraint are true  , the left han(lprop ( . 
sition is true also . As it is currently defined ASTL has no bailt-in delinition with respect to coherence  . 
that is there is no built in mechanism that stops a situation SU l  ) l ) orting bath a fact and its dual ( the fact with the opposite polarity ) Coastraints can be generalised using variabh , s . 
An example will help to illustrate this . If we define the folh ) wing basic situation and constraint : Sitl:\ [ S  ) S !:<< smile , t , l >>\] . 
* S :\[ S!S !=<< happy , *Y , l >>\] <=* S:\[S!S ) = << smile , * Y , l >>\] , hf for lnally the constrainl states that in all y situati  ( m where something smiles it . is also Imppy ( mtlmts anw situation ) . From the above bmsi ( : axioms we can derive that tile following is true : Sitl:\[S ! s !~< < happy  , t , l > >
S !=<< smile , t , l >>\] l lather than just use the linear for lns for displaying ASTL objects  , an extension has been added for OUtlmt . Based on EKN\[l\]ASTL objects can be displayed a  . sboxes , making comple ? objects nm cheasier to view . In this notation we write situations its boxes with their names matopleft in set with facts written  ( in a more conventional predicate ar-gmnent form ) inside the box . 
Using the work of Cooper\[d\]we can process language in a situation theoretic way  . Situation Theoretic Grammar takes the view that utterances can be represented by situations  . For example ~ m3j " Imm ko "-= ~ cat(gIT 123 , Proper Notm)/use . of ( SIT123 , " llartako ") That is , the use of the phrase " llanako " gives rise to a situation that supports the facts that it  ( the situation ) is a Proper Noun and it is a use of the word " Hanako "  . We call these utterance situaiions . 
As an utterance happens at a particular time and location this fact should also be recorded in the situation  . In ASTL this temporal aspect is built into the language  . A special form of constraint , grammar rules , can Ire used to constrain utterance situations ~ ( - ; eneral constraints apply to any form of situation  ( utterance or otherwise ) while grammar rules only apply to utterance situations  . A grallill larrllle betwee a ! ltLel-allce situation such a  . ,4 * S : \ [ S ! S !~ << cat , S , ~ ontonce , t >>\] <-* NP:\[S!S!~<<cat , S , Noun Phra8e , l >>\] , * VP:\[S ! S!~<<cat , S , Vorb Phrase , l >>\] . 
t ; tkes into accolllt that the two utterance situations occm next to each other It is possible to model all of this within the standard constraint system by adding facts almut start and endl  ) oints of utterances ( in ammihu , way that l ) C ( _ ~ sarc interpreted in l ' roh ) g ) but as one of the main uses of ASTL is language processing it w~s felt more elllcient to buiht utterance situations  ( and constraints on them ) dr-redly into the language . 
A basic impienmntation has been made within Common I  , is p which takes ASTL dcscriplions ( deft-nitions , basic situations and constraints ) and allows queries to be made about their sets of constraints and I  ) its icsituations . 
Discourse representation theory
Given a simple language like ASTL there is now the question about low it can be used in rel  ) resenting other semantic theories . DRT\[7\]ota ~ rs are presen-tat , ionlot discourses . A discoursercprcs enlalion structure ( I ) RS ) is dctined at each stage in a discourse describing the cllrrell t state of the  analys/8  . 
AI ) RS consists of two parts ; a set of domain mark-rr . s , whicl l can be bound to objects introduced into the current discourse  , and a set of conditions on these markers . I ) ltSs are typically written as boxes with the markers in the top part and conditions below  . For example aI ) RS for the utterance " aman 81 liftS"iS
X = an(X ) l_='72\]
The following description of I ) RT in ASTL is based on lheI ) HT definition in \[6\] . First we need a syntactic backbone to be able to discuss the construc-ti  ( mofaI ) RS for a discourse . As seen ( briefly ) above AS'I'I , oilers a basic grammar formalism . That is , grammar rules are Sl ) ecilled as e oastraints be-twet'niltterance siluatiol lS  , AL'DASDECOLING-92 , NAI ~' H~S , 2328 aot ~ r19921I17I'ROC . OFCOLING-92, NAN rFs , AUG .  2328 ,   1992 Given such a backbone we need to define an aSTL representation for DRSs  . DRSs have two parts . Discourse markers c0 . n be represenled a spa-rallleter sill ASTI . . Ill situation theor3 parameters denote partially determined objects . Parameters can be anchored to other objects as information about tt ~ eir denotation is found  . DRS conditions arc represented by i-terms . ADRS itself is represented as a parametrics i tuation -- a situation whose type contains parameters  . Discourse markers are not explicitly listed in the  1  ) ITS representation . An ASTI . representation of the I ) RS for % mans tags " is
Sit 34 S : :\[ S!S != << man , X , 1 > >
S !=<< sing,X,l >>\]
W\]lerl ' X is a paraoleter.
This allows a siml ) le semantics close to thai of a conven (  . ional I ) RS . That is an ASTLI ) RS will betruc I or some situation ( i . e . a model ) if there exists an anchoring for the parameters in it which make it aly pe of the model -situation  . A special definition will be needed for titile condition every  ( and possil ) ly others if extensions to basic DI ( I ' are in-eh Med )  . It may be better to think of the situation nellie also as a parameter which gets anchored Io the model-sitnation  . Hut as the semantics of ASTL relates situations names to situations  ( i . e . two sit-m~t . ionnanles can denote the same situation ) flmre is still a level of indirection . 
DHSs arc objects which are related to utterane e situations  . They are not themselves representations of the utterances but representations of whaltile utterances describe  . 
Threading
Animl > ortant aspect of I ) R Tishowa I ) RS is constructed from a discourse . Here ( and in\[6\] ) we use tile technique of threading . Tile general idea is that a DH . Sgets passed through a discoarse being added to as the discourse l  ) rogresses . 
hit his description , a discourse consists of a set of utterance situations which call In ' viewed tim  ) ugh a number of different structural relations , The tirslis throughtile relation daughter which define stile syntactic structure of lhedis course as defined by the grammar rules  ( immediate do ini-nance and linear precedence )  . Secondly the thread rdal . ion defines an ordering of tilentle rances it u-al iens used in the generation of the l  ) RSs . I , as llythere are two relations , range and bodylined ill defining the logical structure of the discourse  . 
The threading relation is a binary relation between utterance situations  . We will say the first argument is threaded to tile second  . Each utterance situation appears exactly once a , S the second argument in tile thread relation ( i . e . i l . has exactly one incoming thread ) . There is one exeeplion , a special situation called DStart which does not have an incoming thread  ( it is used to represent he null context at the start of a discourse  )  , bm does appear as all incoming thread for one or more utterance situations  . There are no cycles m thread hlg but as we shall see there may be more than one linked thread of utterances within a discourse  . The actual construction of the threading relations is discussed later  . 
Each utterance situation is related to two DRSs , throught imrelations DRS In and DRSOut . ADRS In DR Sistim DRS Out DRS of the incoming thread  . 
Tiffs constraint can be written in ASTLo ~'- ; * S :\[ S!S!-<<DRS In , S , * DRS , I >>\] <= TS:\[TS!TS != << thread , * Sl ,  *$  , l >>\] , * SI:\[S1!S1!=<<DRSBut , SI , * DRS , I >>\] . 
The relation between the two DRSs related to an utterance is also constrained  , This is a core part of DRT . Basically the outgoing DRS contains the same information as them cnming DRS plus any reformation the utterance adds to the discourse  . In the cruse of a proper noun utterance situation we can capture this relation with the following constraint : * S :\[ S!S != << DRS out  , S , * DRS out ::* DRS lnTypek\[D ! D!~<< name , *X , *N , l>>\] , l >>\] <=* S :\[ S!S !=<< cat , S , ProperNotm , l>>
S ! ~<< uBe of , S , * N , l > >
S !=<< aem , S , * X , l > >
S !=<< DRSTn , S , * DRS in ::* DRS In Type , l >>\] hfformation is monotonically increasing m l  ) RSs as we traverse along a thread . We are not destruc-tively modifying a DRS as the discourse progresses but constructing a new DRS which supports the same conditions as the incoming DRS  . The constraint above forms the outgoing I ) RS from the type ( * DRS In Type ) of tile incoming one , which will contain all the conditions of the incoming DRS  , plus a new condition introducing the parameter for the I  ) roper noun and a condition on its name . 
We also have tile constrain that any argument or relation that appears in the conditions of a DRS must be related to some utterance situation by the relations ere previously ill that thread  . This condition means that argnments are threaded before predicates  . For example both the subject NP and object NP of a simple sentence will be threaded l  ) e-fore the VP . In eontrmst in \[6\] tile VP comes before a object NP which means a I ) RS is created with an argmnent in a condition which is not yet determined  ( i . e . a free variable ) . 
The other structural relations are range and body Each determiner utterance situation appears in exactly one range-relation and exactly one body -relation  . Tile second argument to these relations are utterance situations that do not appear as first arguments in any threading relation  ( i . c . they are ends of threads ) . Tile DRS0ut of a determiner utterance situation is af lmction of the DRS In I  ) I?~S plus information from the range and body related threads  , hitheevery determiner case tile DRSOut , constraint is * S :\[ S!S != << DRS But , S , * DRSOut::*DRSInTypeIt\[DS!DS !=<< every , * Range DRS , * Body DRS , l >>\] , 1>>\] ACRES DECOLING-92 , NANTES . 2328 AOm 19921118 PROC .

Although translation of DRT into ASTI , is possible there are some important consequences  . Tile semantics of an ASTLDRS , briefly described above , requires that it is possible to tell the properties of every object in the situation  . As situations are partial it may not be defined for everything whether it is a man or not  , thus it is not possible to define " all men . " ( Note , lack of information does not imply falsity . ) This is perhaps unfair to consider this as a problem as m the standar definitions of DR?I'it is required that the model be complete  ( all prop-ertics are defined on all objects ) -so it seems no worse to require this of the situation in which we are finding tile trnth conditions of a  1  ) RS . llowever we could include further definitions for the every relation and require that therebe some resource situation that identifies actual objects that fall in its scope  . This technique has been used by \[4\] . 
There is the question of compositionality . It could be said that the threading relations are only partially determined eompositionally  . But this seems exactly what the theory states and the intuition behind it  . We cannot define aI ) RS for a noun phrase nnless we know what context i le NP is ill  . All that can be determined is partial definition with conditions on the context  . 
An important aspect of DRT is that there is a left to right dependency on DRSs  . This does not necessarily mean that parsing must be left to right  , though normally it will be . A definition of I ) RT should in elnde this dependency and not rely on how a implementation happens to order processing  . Tile ASTL definition does include a left to right dependency  , without specifying a processing order on the inference mechanisn\]  . 

This paper has introduced tile notion of using situation theory a  . sa basic formalism in which other semantic theories might be defined  . A computational situation theoretic language called ASTL is discussed  . Sitnatlon theory is suitable as basis for a metatheory because a representation fsituations allows the representation of higher order objects necessary for describing other semantic theories  . A possible translation of I ) I~T in ASTL is given . The coverage is that of \[6\] . 
This translation is interesting because first it shows that situation theory is not some opposing semantic theory but that it can be used ill discussing other theories  , tIo we verper haps it is not surprising that a language such as ASTL is powerful enough to give this translation  . A feature system , with sets ( or some definition ) , cycles and constraints is close to what ASTL is , but it is interesting that these properties can be found as the basis illa current semantic theory without introducing a new theory  . Finally a situation theoretic description of DRT allows extensions of DRT to use the properties of situation theory  . Situations which are useful ill describing various natural anguage semantic phenomena  ( e . g . naked infinitives ) are now readily available to be included in exteusious of DRT  .
