q'hispaper provides an account of the role that the interaction betwee nominal and temporal reference plays in resolving temporal reference  . Exploiting this interaction in resolving temporal reference clarifies how the process of resolving nominal reference interacts with the process of resolving temporal reference  , and how a restricted set of worht knowledge contributes to resolving temporal reference  . 
1 INTRODUCTION
B . esolving reference or anaphora is of great interest in computational linguistics and form M semantics  . 
Research on reference began with the development of models to account for nominal reference brong ht about by the usage of nominal expressions uch as definite noun phrases and pronominals  ( Grosz , Joshi and Weinstein 1983; Kameyama 1986) . Recently a number of researchers have indicated that temporal expressions such as tense morphemes and temporal adverbials can be regarded as referring expressions and have proposed models for temporal reference resolution  ( Hinrichs 1986 ; Hwang and Schubert 1992 ; Kameyama , Passonnean and Poesio 1993; Lascarides1 . 992 ; Partee 1984 ; Song and Cohen 1991 ; Webber 1988) . 
Sentences in a dialogue describe ventualities 1 and introduce them into the context . The time of an eventuality described by a sentence is interpreted as temporally related to the times of other eventualities that were introduced into the context earlier in the dialogue  . Temporal expressions are regarded as referring expression since they convey information about the time of an eventuality  , which is interpreted relative to the times of other eventualities in the context  . Resolving temporal reference means determining what temporal relationships exist between an eventuality described by a sentence of a dialogue and eventualities that have been introduced into the context earlier in the dialogue  .   2 Resolving temporal reference is requisite to many tasks  , such as designing a natural language interface to a planning system in which temporal information is crucial  ( Crouch and Pullmant an event . uality is the general term for an event , processor state , due to Bach (1986) . 
~ The chief concern here is temporal reference to intersentential context  . Thus this paper does not address the probiem of determining what temporal relationships an eventuality described by a clause of a sent  , ence has with eventualities described by other clauses of the same sentence  . This problem is covered by Brent (1990) , It wang et al (1992) , and Reichenbaeh (1947) . 

To understand the notion of temporal reference , consider the following dialogue , ( dl ) . a Assume tha ~ dialogue participants , Bill and John , mutually know that John received an email message from Mary  . 
Dialogue ( dl )   ( sl ) Bill : Mary karanomail wa mot-teirn-yone ? from mail ToP have ~ PRESENT You have the mail from Mary  , don't your(s2) John : Keshi-ta-ke do . 

I deleted it.
( s3) Bilh Hontoni ! really
Really \] ( s4 ) John : Sochirani waten soushi-ta-ha zuda-yo . 
you DAT forward ~ PhsT-sure.
I'm sure that l forwarded it to you.
(s5 ) John : So chiranomail boxniat-ta-des ho ? you GFN mail boz " in be-PAST  . 
II was in your mail bo ~', was n't it?.
Sentence ( s2 ) describes an eventnality of deleting , Ed , and sentence ( s4 ) describes an eventuality of forwarding , F / . Both eventualities are past ones , since the matrix verbs , " tensous nru ( forward ) " and " kesu ( delete ) " ,   4 describe momentary acts and are accompanied with the past-tense morpheme " ta "  . Although the tense morphemes of sentences convey information about the times of eventualities described by the sentences  , the context also imposes restrictions on the times of the eventualities  . In dialogue ( dl ) , the time of tQ described by ( s4 ) is interpreted as relative to the time of \]' d ~ in the context : i  . e . the time of E/is before the time of 1, 2d . in this sense , the time of 1~ is referred to in uttering sentence ( s4 )  . 
Existing models of temporal reference account for the parMlel between temporal and nominal reference  . 
I to wever , as I will state in see .  2 , existing models fail to explain the interaction between temporal reference and nominal reference  ( reference interaction for short )  , ieference interaction is a phenomenon i which tile process of resolving nominal reference in -ah lext fibiting a  . Japanese dialogue , English words such as " Mary " mtd " mail " are used only for easy comprehensibility  , hi add lt , ion , sentence-final forms such as " yone " , " kedo " , " yo " , and " desho " indicatemental states of file speaker that are/mrelated to the subject of this paper  . 
4 " tensoushi -" and " keshi -" in file dialogue are inflections of the verbs " tensous m ' u " and " kesu " respectively  . 
1 138 teracts with the process of resolving temporal reference  , when an utterance involves temporal and nominal reference at the same time  . l ) ue to as1 insutticient account of the reference interaction  , existing models cannot show how the process of resolving nominal reference Mfects the process of resolving temporal reference  . 
The chief concern of this paper is to describe the role that the reference interaction plays in resolving telnporal reference and demonstrate hat the reference interaction serves to clarity how a restricted set of world knowledge contributes to the resolution process  . 
I focus on sentences with past-tense morphemes in Japanese dialogues  . Previous work also used past-tense sentences as a touchstone to show the validity of a model  ( II in richs 1986 ; Kameyamactal . 1993; Lascarides 1992; Partee 1984; Webber 1988) . As I will state in sec .  2 . 2 , the retk ' xence interaction is not a domestic plleuolne nonin Japanese dialogues  . 
In sec . 2, I argue that existing models do not de- . 
count for the reference interaction , that the reference interaction plays an important role in an account of how temporal reference is resolved  , and that exploiting the reference interaction clarifies how a rest  , rioted set of world knowledge serves to resolve tempered reference  . In sec .  3 , at Yame work is presented , within which the reference interaction is exploited in resolving temporal reference  . In sec . 4, 1 demonstrate how f , he framework works . In sec .  5 , \[ smnmarize the claims of this paper and describe fnture  , work . 
2 PROBLEM SWITHEXISTING MODELS 2 . 1 Approaches in existing models In existing models  , when the t , ime ,  7' , of an event alality described by a sentence of a dialogue is given  , the problem of resolving temporal reference is divided into  ( i ) that of identifying the time ,  71/ , of an eventuality that has been introduced into the context  , and ( ii ) that of determining what temporal relationship hohls between  7' and 7  ) : . 
The notion of temporal Ibcus is nsed to solve proh . - lem(i ) .  ' , ' he notion was introduced by Webl , er (~988) , Dialogue participants pay attention to the time of an eventuality that is in the temporal focus  . '\[' he time ,  51' , of an eventuality described by the cnrrent sentence is interpreted according to the time  , T tf , in the temporal focus . Existing models that apply to intersentential context use the notion of temporal focus  ( ll wangelel , 1992; Songctel .  19911 . Kameyama et el . (1993) refined the . notion of temporal focus and proposed the notion of temporal centering  . In formal semantics , models of temporal anaphora based on discourse representation theory have been proposed  ( ltinrichs 71983 ; Partee 1984) . ' Fhese models concentrate on the tense interpretation of adjacent sentences its a narrative discourse  . Thus , the time of ; mew ; ntuality described l ) 5' a sentence immediately preceding tile current sentence can be regarded as being in the temporal hens  . 
There ~ r0 . two ~ tp proaches to prol ) lcm ( ii ) :  ( ii-a ) avapproach based on linguistic cuen such as tense morphelnes  , the aspectual class of verbs , and the descriptive order of eventualities in a dialogne  ;   ( ii-b ) an approach based oil worht knowledge of the causal relationships between eveut nalities  . 
With regard Co approach ( ii-a ) , the following default interpretation rules ( ilin richs 1986 ; Kameyama et el .  1993 ; bascarides 1992 ; Partce 1984 ; Webb 0 r19881 have been used . ' ~' De . fault into . r pretation rules ) Provided that an eventuality , t ? , is described by the current sentence , the time of an eventuality , let \] , is in the temporal focus , and both /' , ' and\[?t/are past . 
eventualities , then ( R1 ) The time of E is after the time of /? tf if both
I ? and l '; tf are non-st , drive ,   ( 12 ) The time of /? contains the time of ICe\]if \]? is stative and l'  , ' tf is nonstative . 
These rules are t ; erme default interpretation rules since they are utilized when world knowledge of causality is not available  . 
\ [ n approach ( ii-b ) , the temporal relationship between l , \] and . l?tf is determined according to world knowledge of the causal relationships between eventualities  . Lascarides (1 . 9!t2 ) presented a model based on a theory of defeasihle inference for integrating world knowledge of causality with the process of determining the temporal and causal relationships between even tualities mentioned in a discourse  . This approach was also adopted in a model proposed by Kamey a mactel  . 
(1993) . In these models , approaches ( ii - ~ ) and ( ii-b ) are unified within a single framework . Let mecall the interpretation based on approach ( ii-a ) the ( le-fanlt interpretation , and the interpretation based on approach ( ii-b ) the knowledge-based interpretation . 
The knowledge ~ based interpretation is preferred over the default interpretation when they disagree  . 
l , etme explain how existing models work by using ( tialogue ( dl ) ~ as , example . 1 focus on how(s4) i , , interpreted , assuming that the time of /~' a is in the . 
temporal focus , l)eNnlt interpretation rule(hi . l ) says that the Lime of \] Q must be after the time of leasit tce both eventualities are not > stative  , past eventualities . 
I lowev cr , the relevant interpretation is that F , /temporally precedes l ' , ' a . Thus , the default interpretation does not coincide with the relevant interpretation  . In this case , existing models resort to world knowledge of the ransal relationships between ?' a and Ej  . l to w . 
cw' . r , existing models do not clarify what kind of world knowledge is use  . d ( Kameyama et el . 1993; I , ascarides 1992) . In this sense , the world knowledge used in existing models is unrestricted  .   1 agree with such an approach its that various causal relationships are in--volved ill the process of resolving reference  . I Ioweve Lit is desirable to find a restricted set of world knowledge and avoid resorting directly to the entire set of ~ Note that the time of a stative ven~uallty is usually nc  ) tregarded as being in the t . emporal focus . 
1 139 world knowledge of causality since such knowledge is enormous  . 
Consequently , existing models exploit the notion of temporal focus or temporal center  , which serves only to show that temporal reference is accounted for in the same way as nominal reference  . However , existing models do not explain how the process of resolving nominal reference affects the process of resolving temporal reference and assume that the entire set of knowledge of causality can be used  . 
2.2 Reference interaction
In this section , I argue that the notion of reference interaction provides an account of the temporal reference in  ( s4 )  , which existing approaches ignore . Moreover , a restricted set of world knowledge can be used to explain the reference interaction  . 
Sentence ( sl ) introduces an individual 6 , M , which is an email message . Sentence ( s4 ) involves nominal reference to M : tile object of " tensous nrn  ( forward ) " is zero-pronominalized and refers to M . Moreover , sentence ( s4 ) involves the interaction between nominal and temporal reference  . That is to say , what the object being forwarded is affects what the time of forwarding is  . I will explain this below . 
When someone forwards something to someone else , the time of forwarding must be during the time when the object being forwarded exists  . In other words , the time of forwarding depends on what the object being forwarded is  . Moreover , when someone delete something , the time when the object being deleted exists must be before the time of deleting  . This kind of world knowledge can be regarded as knowledge of temporal relationships between eventualities and the existential status of individuals  . Judgingfi : om such knowledge , the eventuality of forwarding , EI , cannot temporally follows the eventuality of deleting  , E a . This is because both the object of " kesu ( delete ) " and the object of " tensousuru ( for-ward ) " refer to M , so the time of t ~' f must be during the time when M exists and the time when M exists r nust be before the time of Ed  , The interpretation consistent with such knowledge is that/~Sf temporally precedes Ea  . Consequently , identifying the referent of the zero -pronominalized object of/Q serves to resolve temporal reference  , and the knowledge of temporal relationships between eventualities and the existential status of individuals can be used to explain the reference interaction  . 7 Moreover , knowledge of the temporal relationships between eventualities and the existential status of in -dividnals can be regarded as a restricted set of world knowledge of causality  . It is restricted because given an eventuality , E , we have only to allow for the individuals that constitute E and do not have to allow ? flere  , " individual " is used as a term for a single person or thing  . 
7 In this paper , only nominal reference to individuals is allowed for  . 
for all eventualities that can be causally related to E  . Exploiting the reference interaction clarifies how such a restricted set of world knowledge contributes to resolving temporal reference  . When such restricted world knowledge is sufficient ore solve temporal reference  , immediate recourse to the entire set of world knowledge of causality call be avoided  . Note that such knowledge is not selected arbitrarily  . It is the knowledge that is necessary for explaining the reference interaction  . 
Next I review two existing proposals that are related to the argument above  . First , Hwangelal . 
(1992 ) argued that resolving temporal reference requires plausible inference that can interact with various processe such as resolution of anaphora  , introduction of new individuals and identification of spatial and temporal frames  . They also argue that the plausible inference has to rely on world knowledge such as that one normally would not buy broken things  ( II wange?al . 1992: p . 239) . Their argument agrees with the approach presented here  . They did not , however , present a concrete model to support the argument . 
Second , Webber and Baldwin ( 1992 ) discussed the integration of two independent mechanisms for context-change by entity introduction and by event simulation  . The idea of integrating these context-change mechanisms and that of exploiting the reference interaction in resolving reference share the view that the relationships between eventualities and the existential status of entities or individuals ervein interpreting referring expressions  . They , however , focused on interpreting nominal reference made by the use of definite nouns  , rather than on the problem of resolving temporal reference by exploiting the reference interaction  , which is the chief concern of this paper . 
Finally , it is easy to see that the reference interaction also occurs in an English dialogue  . In an English counterpart of ( dl ) , the pronoun " it " is used the same way as a Japanese zero pronoun is used  . l , ikewise , the restricted knowledge stated above is common to 
Japanese and English.
3 AFR AME WORK
A framework is presented , within which the reference interaction is exploited in resolving temporal reference  . First , in sec .  3 . 1, the descriptive device is shown . 
Next , in sec .  3 . 2 , the process of resolving temporal reference is described  . 
3.1 A descriptive device
In a di Mogue , sentences convey information about timspeakers ' mental attitudes toward eventualities  . This framework does not concern the mental attitudes  , but focuses on the eventualities described in the sentences  . 
An eventuality is written as a variant of the Davidsonian representation  ( l ) avids on 1980 ; Vlach 1993) . For example , the informational content of the eventuality of for warding described by  ( s4 ) is written as follows . 
1140 ( rl ) 7' ypc(.c\]l , . t , ' or ward)&
Agcnt (* e\]l , * agcnt ~) & leccp(*e\]1 , * rccpl ) & Objert (* c\]l , * objl ) &' l'im c(*c\]1 , ,t \] z ) & NonStativ c ( * c\]l ) & llcarer ( * rccpl ) &

Symbols starting with a cN ) it alletter represent constants and symbols starting witl  , the ctm racter '*' represent varlahles . Symbol '~;' is an of ) erator\[or con-junetkm . 
Type(L' , T ) means that eventuality l , ; is classified as a type T . t . epresentation ( r l ) specifies the . eventuality , * e/l , that * agcntlt brwards * objt to * rcepl at time * t\]  ,  . The agem , and tire object of forwarding are represented as variables  , since they are zero-pronominalized . Llcarcr(l ') means that P is the hearer . In the above , the recipient of forwarding is identified with the hearer since it is specified by tire pronoun " sochira "  , designating the hearer . In addition , ewmtuality*c:1 is non-st~d . ive . 
SpecchTimc ( T ) means that time 7' is the speech time , Tcmp\]Coeus ( 7 ' ) means that time T is in the temporal focus , and 7' Rel(l , 7' t , 7: e ) means that temporal relationshiplg holds between time ~ I'\] and  7  )  . 
In this framework , temporal relationships are represented based on temporal logic proposed by Allen  ( 1983 ) and times are treated as temporal intervals . In the above , time * tSl is before sl ) eech time * GpJ since * Ill is specified by the past-tense morpheme " ta "  . 
Time * tlo ~ . , t , t is in the temporal focus . Temporal relationship betweeen * Ill attd*l\]o ~u  , l is represented a saw ~ riable , * roll . Resolving temporal rel ) rence means determining a relevant tent poral relationship betwee n * tit and * t\]ocu  . ,1 . 
Knowledge of the temporal relationship between an ewmtuality and the existential status of individuals is represented as a triplet <\] ~  ; R , i \[ ~ . , . . . ,Tlg > , where 1 , ; 1~ is a represent , ttion for the eventuality , \[ R ,   .   .   . is a set of representations of the existen- . 
tial status of the individuals , and Tt~is the teulpo-ral relationship between them  . This framework concerns the existential status of individuals such that an individual exists at a certain space-time location of the physical world  . For example , knowledge about an eventuality of forwarding is written as follows  . 
( r2) < : l~3lQ , ll~ja , \[ IQb , '\]'\[ f > , where l , ; le:do:7' gpc ( . e \], Forward )&,

The object thai ; the recipient of forwarding receives is , lot identified with * obj becmlse of domestic on straints concerning an email system  , lJgIi , says that * copy exists at time * tcopuan datlo ( ' ation * le~py , which the recipient of forwarding owns . 3' l ? . j says that the time : of forwarding , * tj , must be during the time , * to , j , when . obj exists , and that the time of forwarding , * t:nmst be before the time , * tcopy , when * copy exists .

3.2 Resolving temporal reference
This framework assumes that a representation of an eventuality described by a sentence is given  , in the representation , pronominalized individuals an ( lindeterminate teml ) oral relationships are represented as variables uchas *  agent1 ~md*r Ollin ( rl )  . When the representation f the eventuality described by the current sentence is given  , representations of the existential status of individuals and temporal relationships between the eventuality amt the existential status of individuals are derived by using knowledge such gm within the context as described below  . In the interpretation process , appropriate constants are substituted for variables  . After the interpretation process , the representations are introduced into the context  . Thus , the context includes representations of event nalities  , the existential status of individuals , and temporal relationships among the eventualities and the existential status of individuals that have been mentioned in a dialogue  . In addition , it includes representations that show who is the speaker ~ who is the hearer  , what is the speech time , and what is the time in the temporal focus . 
Let RSet be a set of representations of an eventuality  , E , described by a sentence , the existential status of individuals mentioned in E  , and temporal relationships between them . The interpretation process is as follows . 
(I1) A representation ,  /~ , in 12 set is unified with a representation , R  ~ , in the context , if possible . 
Through unification , constants in R ~ are substituted for variables in /C  ( i2 ) An indeterm in a temporal relationship between the time of eventuality E and the time in the temporal focus is identified with the relevant temporal relation according to default interpretation rules and transitive and reflexive laws governing temporal relationships  . 
(I3 ) Constants are generated and substituted for variables that cannot be identified in steps  ( I 1 ) and ( I 2 ) of this process . 
(I4 ) Representation siR set are added to the context . 
Some nominal reference is resolved in ( I1) , although this paper does not go into how nominal reference is resolved  . 
In ( I2), temporal reference is resolved . The interpretation by transitive and reflexive laws governing temporal relationshipsip referred over the interpretation by default interpretation rules  . 
This framework uses the defanlt interpretation rules  ( R1 ) and ( R2 )  , which are used in existing models . The default interpretation rules ( R1 ) and ( R2 ) are represented as the following theorems , ( r4) and ( r5) respectively , s(r4) Time (* ei , * ti ) & NonStative(*e ~) & Time (* et\] , * tt\])&N on Stative(*etf ) & Temp Vocus ( . t ~/) DTRel ( After, . t ~, . its ) . 
(1"5) Tirrte(*ei , * ti)g Stative(*ei ) &
Tirne(*eti , * hi ) & NonStative(*etj ) &
TempFocus(*tt\])DTRel(Contains,*t ~,* ttf) . 
In the above ,   R1 D R2 means that RI implies R > The transitive and reflexive laws governing temporal relationships are also represented as theorems  . 
For brevity's sake , I will not present all the laws . 
Allen ( 1983 ) presents a exhanstive list of transitive SH are i ignore conditions where the eventualities at stake are past ones  . 
laws governing temporal relationships . The following theorems are sufficient for dealing with dialogue  ( dl )  . 
( r6) T~el(1)u , ' i ~ q , **, * z ) ~7', ' el(M~<*~,*V )
Trel ( Befove , * x , * y).

( rS)T ~ el(D,m . g , **, , y ) ~: C~l(Co . ~, i . .~, w , *~) . 
The interpretation by the transitive and rellexive laws governing temporal relationships can be regarded as a kind of of knowledge-based interpretation as described in sec  .  2 . 1 , although only a restricted set of world knowledge is used in this framework  . As demonstrated in see .  4 , the interaction between references to individuals and times plays an important role in resolving temporal reference according to the transitive and reflexive laws governing temporal  , : elationships . 
4 EXAMPLES
This section demonstrates how the framework works by using sentence  ( s4 ) and ( s5 ) as examples . First , consider the interpretation of ( s4 ) under the context established by ( s2 )  . Sentence ( s2 ) introduces an eventuality of deleting , Ed , into the context . The eventuality is represented as follows . 
( r9) Tyl)e(\]2,'d , Delete ) &
Agent ( Ed , John ) & Objeet(lSd , M ) &
Time(Ed,Td ) & NonStative(13d ) &
Before ( IQ , 7; p).
in(rg ) , M represents an individual , which is an email message , Td represents the time of Ed , and ?\['~ p represents the time when sentence ( s2 ) is uttered . 9By using knowledge ( r3) , the existential status , Era , of M and the temporal relationship between Ed and Em are derived and introduced into the context  . 
They are written as follows.
( rl0)Type(E .,, Exist ) &
Object(E,u,M ) & Loc(t'Jm,Lm)&
Owner(L . . . . John ) & Time(t '~' m , 5/;,~).
(,.11): t'Rd(M~et , 7;,~, T ~)
Tm represents the time when the email message M exists and L  , ~ represents the location of M . 
The context also includes the following representation when  ( s4 ) is interpreted . 
(r12) Speaker ( John ) & llearer (13 ill).
(r13) SpaechTime(T , p ) & 7' empFocus'(Td).
Namely , I assume that the time of deleting ~ Td , is in the temporal focus when ( s4 ) is interpreted . 
Now , let me explain how sentence ( s4 ) is interpreted under the above context . Sentence ( s4 ) describes an eventuality of forwarding , * ell , which is written ~ representation ( rl ) described in sac .  3 . 1 . 
Likewise , by using knowledge@2) , the following representations are derived . 
( rl .4) Type (* eobj ~, lTxist ) &
Object (* eobjl , * objl ) & Loc (* e obji , * lobjJ ) & Owner (* lobjl , * agent l ) & Time (* e0 bj1 , * to U1) .

( rl6)~l'\[ee ~(\] Olt , ' iT tq , * t\]l ,   , let objl ) . 
(r17) TRel(Before,*tf ~,* t~o~vz).
In(rl ), * agent x , * rc . cpl and * objl represent respectively the pronominalized agent  , recipient , and object off brwarding . Variable * reep ~ is identified with Bill by , rallying\[learer ( * recp ~ ) in ( rl ) with ( r12 ) in the coutext . 
Representation ( r14) is unified with ( rl0) , ~? and then * ayent ~ is identified with John and * obj\]is iden-tiffed with M  . Likewise , * e obj ~ , * lobj ~ , and * to~j ~ are identified respectively with Era  , Lm and g , , . 
Consequently , nominal reference in sentence ( s4) is resolved . As stated below , identifying * obji with 3//serves to resolve temporal reference . 
By using ( r13), variables , * t,~)~ and * tf . . . . . 1 are identitied respectively with T . ~v and 7' d . 
The following temporal relationship is deriw ; dfi'om ( r16 ) bee~mse*objlisid entitied with M and then* to bjl is identified with "/  ;  , ~ .

The tbllowing temporal relationship is derived t . '1"o111 ( rl ) because*t\]o ~, . , ~ is identitied with 7' d . 
( rl9)T\[eel(*rel ,,* t\],, Td).
Resolving temporal reference here means determining temporal relationship * tel  , in ( r19) . 
By default interi ) retation rule ( r4) , the tbllowing representation is derived from ( r19 )  . 
( r20) 7' ted(After,*t\]~,:la).
On the other hand , by applying theorem ( r6 ) to ( r19 ) and then using ( r18 ) and ( r \] l )  , the following represent ~ tion is derived . 
(r21): l'~.dUtefo,"<*t\]\],"~'~).

Let me explain how the fi'amework interprets(sS ) . 
First of all , * person in ( r26) is identified with Bill , since * person nmst be the hearer . '\[' hen*%2 in ( r26 ) is identitied with E~ovy in ( r23 )  . Likewise , * obj . e , * l,~u , and * t ~ . u are identified respectively with Copy , L ~ ovy , and Teovv . Thus timzero-pronominalized subject is appropriately interpreted  . As a result , the following temporal relationship is derived from  ( r26 ) since * t : , ,p . 
is identified with " l'~ovy and 7 is in the temporal focus . 
0, 27) 7' Ied(*,'d ~, : I ' ~ o , , , ~, ~. l)).
llere , consider how the temporal relationship * tel2 is determined . By using default interpretation rule ( rS ) , * rel . e is identilied with a relatk m , Contains , since the eventuality described by ( s5) is stative . 
On the other hand , by using ( r25) and theorem ( rT ) , * rel . e is identified with a relation , After . In other words , the time of the eventuality deseribe . d by ( sS ) follows the time of forwarding . This knowledge-based interpretation is l ) referred over the default in -- terp retation , and is the relevant interpretation . 
In the above process , identifying the pronominalized subject , * obj2 , of ( sS ) with Copy is crucial for the temporal reference resolution  . Assume that * obj ~ happens when*ex2 in ( r26 ) is identified with E , ~ in(rl0) and * t~2 is identified with 7~ . In this case , the following temporal relationship is derived from  ( r26 )  . 
( r28) T~el(.rel ~, Tin , T~).
By using ( r24) and theorem ( r8) , * rel2 is identified with a relation , Contains . This interpretation is not relevant . 
However , the case that leads to the wrong interpretation ever occurs  . When * e~2 is identified with Era , the following representation is derived from ( r26 ) since * person is identified with Bill . 
( r29) Loc(Em , * l ~ . 2) & Owner (* l~2, Bill) . 
This representation is inconsistent with ( r l 0 ) since the owner of the location of the email message M must be uniquely identified  . Thus , * e ~ . 2 must be identified with E~opy and then * obj2 must be identified with Copy . 
Consequently , identifying appropriately the referent of the pronominalized subject of sentence  ( s5 ) affects the process of resolving temporal reference  , and this reference interaction can be explained by exploiting knowledge such as  ( r2 ) and ( r3 )  . 
5 CONCLUSION
This paper has made a twofold contribution to research on temporal reference resolution  . First , an account of the role played by the reference interaction in resolving temporal reference is given  . As stated in see .  2 , existing models cannot account for how the process of resolving nominal reference affects the process of resolving temporal reference since they do not explain the reference interaction  . Second , it is shown that exploiting the reference interaction clarifies how a restricted set of world knowledge  ( knowledge of the temporal relationships between eventualities and the existential status of individuals  ) contributes to the resolution process . As stated in see .  2 , existing models resort to the entire set of causality knowledge  . I do not entirely deny the validity of the existing approach  . 
However , when a restricted set of world knowledge is sufficient ore solve temporal reference  , immediate recourse to the entire set of world knowledge of causality can be avoided  . A framework is also presented , within which temporal reference is resolved by exploiting the reference interaction  . 
Future work will first extend the framework to deal with eventualities specified by various tense morphemes  , whereas this paper focuses on eventualities specified by the past-tense morpheme " ta "  . Next , to explore the notion of reference interaction in more detail  , the way resolving temporal reference affects the resolution of nominal reference must be investigated  , whereas this paper concentrates on the converse process  . Finally , the coverage of this framework must be evaluated . Evaluation will require an exhaustive listing of possible cases of the existential status of individuals that are used to resolve reference  . This paper accounts for cases where an individual exists at a certain space-time location of the physical world  . We can allow for other kinds of existential status  , such as a status where an individuM exists in the mental state of a dialogue participant  .  11
