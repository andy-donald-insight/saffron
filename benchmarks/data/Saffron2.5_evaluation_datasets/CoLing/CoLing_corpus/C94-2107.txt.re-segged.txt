2 qlanako'is ; i typical giN's li&i il ( L center of the subordinate clause . Therefore the hack-ward center of the subordin at c lause is tlanak % arm consequently zero subject q h  , , , bj refers to Itanako . 
By the same way as the subordinate clause case is dealt with  , the zero subject o\['the main clause 4~z , ~bj is known to refer to tlanako , too . This result is neither interpretation a nor b shown above  . 
Another candidate is the property sharing thoery \ [Kameyama  88\]  . In her theory , since the both of zero subjects share the snbjecthood  , both of them finally are known to refer to Hanako that is the topic for both of these clauses  . Therefore the prol ) erty sharing theory also fails to account for the iutuitive interpretations  . 
Then we shift our attention to more microscopic one  , ill which , roughly speaking , the important part of semantics of complex sentence is t brmalized as relations among semantic roles that appearill tile main clause or the subordinate clause  . At the first glance , the constraints about these relations are not local in terms of mMn or subordinate clauses  , hr other words , semantic roles that appear in subordinate clause and semantic roles that appear ill the main clause seem to be directly constrained by the constraints of complex sentence  . However , looking more carefiflly , we find that the constraints of subordinate clause and tile cons  ( fronts of main cla . use are represented as local constraints by introduciug the new notion of motivated which is characterized as allers on who haseu ollgh reason to act as the lllain clause describes  . 
More precisely , mo Zivated is one of tire pragmatic roles that appear in a subordinate clause  , and the constraints in subordinate chmse are stated as identity relations between molivaled and other seman-tic/pragmatic roles appearing ill subordinate clause  . 
Therefore these constraints are local in subordinate clause  . The constraints illmain clause are stated as identity relations hetween molivaled which cones from subordinate clause  , and other semantic roles al/pearing in main clause  . Therefore in understanding the mail ( clause we ( h ) u ' t have to be care M ) outse-mantic/pragmatic roles in subordinate cla . use other than a molivaled . In this sense , the constraints ill the main clause can be treated as almost local constraints of the main clause  . 
The next question is how to represent tile semantics of complex sentence in feature structure  ( called l PS henceforth )  . l ? or this , we shouhl write down the constraints about these relations among seman-tic/pragmatic roles illa feature structure formalism  . 
Due to the space limitation , in this l ) a per wema . inly pursue the constraints about semantic feature struc-tares  . 
2 Hierarchical Structure of
Complex Sentence
We pay our attention to the general structure of 3apanese utterance which is help hfl to rel ) resent semantics of complex sentence . Several Japanese linguists have Mready proposed the general struc-tm'e of Japanese utterances \ [ Mikami  53~ Minami 74  , Takuho 87 , ( ~ Ullji89\] . Mikami categorized clauses into three (: lasses , namely ' open ' , ' semi-open ' and ' closed . '\[' his categorization idicates how freely the content of clause interacts with the outside o /' clause  . 
For instance , they arc categorized by the degree of possibilities of coreference between zero pronouns inside the subordinate clause and nomin M or topic that appear in tile main clause  . Following Mikami's idea . , Minami proposed four levels , namely level A , B , C and D which correspond roughly to VP , proposition , sentence without eommuni ( - ~ tionmood and utterance which takes into a . c countahearer , respectively . 
\[ Takubo87\] divided level A into two levels . One of them corresponds to VI' , the other corresponds to VP+a certain kind of subject which is called " objective subject  . " g~unji proposed the more detailed structure , in which starting from predicate , say , verb and adjective , objects , voice , subject , aspect , tense , modality , topic and mood are or might be sequin > tially added to make all in Ibrmatioually more ful-tilled sentence component  , l " iually , it ; ends up with all utterall ce . \ [ nGIlIlji'sstrl lctlll:e , solne node ( ' all have more than two ( laughter nodes to make more coutl ) lex sentence . Following them , tim structure of the socalled ( ch lase level ) complex sentence is the following shown in Fig . I .

Although 1 , his notion of observer ' shares a large part with P IVOT of \[ iida-Sells  88\]  , our notion of ' observer is introduced only by garu  . Therefore it is muchnar-r<wer notion . Asy , u will see later , this ne . wly in-l , roduecd role is playing a key role which bridges semantic roles of subordinal : e  . <: lauset , osclnantic roles of main clause ,  #ks for an observer introduced by garu , one o17 the widely known consequcn c . eaboul ; the nature of suDjective predicate is the following  , ht a sentence , if a subject iw " adjective is used without being fo\[lowed by a verbal sulfix gar'u  , the ez'periencer of the subjective adjective , should het it <; sl > eaker of the sentence . 
The next thit , g we should do about a newly introduced notion of observer is to make  ( : lear the way to deal with it in FS . First of all , in our t " S , a semantic cmltent : Sl , ; M is I ) asically as e a . ( state of alf a . ir ) form of sit . uation semantics . I lowever we use semantic role like " agent " , " patient " , " experiencer " , and so on , as argument roles of sea . Since = an observer observes the situation which is characterized by a sea  , if we know that there exisl . san observer , the observed so a is eml ) edded in ( /b serving situation , which , in turn , is elnl ) ed de . dill the whole semantic (; otltelt . In this SeAlS (+ . , the observed sea's itr~ttttlellt role is observed  .

These categories '\[\> rms are " ( /: < ~ pP-garu " or its past form "4 e : cv\]'-gat-/ , a . " , where 1' is a subjective adjective ( category 4 iH'\['ahle . l ) or is a verb followed by la-(lar(ca . re-gory , 5 in Table . l ) , and </) < , r is the c : r perience e of P which is l ) ossibly zero . luthese categories , there exist . el ) servers who are not the + e : cperience r of 1' , and observe , that exl > erlence .

If the sentence finishes just after " garu/gat-ta  "  , the iml ) ortant points arc l ) an introduced observer is the speaker , and consequently 2 ) the es'perienccr cannot be the speaker . If a clause with " garu/ga . t-ta " is a subordinate claus ( ; , the ca'per , cheer cannot be identified with a semantic role corresponding to the  . 
subject of main clause or higher clause.
As for category 2 , subjective verbs like " ku-rusimu " ( feel sick ) and " kanasimu " ( feel sadness ) that describe subjective and/or emotional experience in verb form  , are used . Like the case of gar'u , an observer who observers the experience can be ill-troduced  . However this observer is not obligatory . 
Therefore unlike the " garu/gat--ta " case , the experiencer also can be an obligatory senrantic role of higher clause as well as the speaker  .

The key point of the semantics of complex sentence is the rolel notivated that appe  . ars in which corresponds to the content of the subordinate Cause  . '\[' he role molival cd is the link between the content of subordinate clause and the main clause  . 
Semantically motivated is characterized as the following  . 
Definition 2 ( Motiwlted ) Motivated is a person who is a j\]~cled by the situation described by the sub-ordinale clause deeply enough I of eel or a clas the main clause describes  . 
The important and indispensable , part of semantics of cnnplexse . ntence is , roughly speaking , the relation between a subordinate clause aud the lib '  . till clause . But if you look more closely , I ; his relation is actually tim relations among semantic/pragmatic roles appearing ill thes  , fllordimlt . e clause aM those appeariug in the main clause . The newly in ~ ro(tuced role of motivated gives . he most important chic for this relation . Therefore , in the rest of this paper , our effort will be concentrated il , to whomamotivated refers , o . More precisely , in FS , our main concerns are which sema , ticrole in the SIqM of subordinate clause the molivaled can or cannot be  . unitied with , and which semantic role in the SEM of main clause the molival cd can or cannot be unified with  .

Constraint M1 says that in both cases , qS ~ . q t is unified with there el\[rated . Intuitively in (6), qS~gt is ~ b ~, . p . On the other hand in (7), Gqt is the observer . Both of these interpretations comply with constraints  $2  , and M1 .

' Since it is hot , I am introuble . '
Intuitively q $1  ~ . , . pcorefer with q52 < . : ~ v . This interpretation is expected by eonstrMnt $3 and M2 that apply in this case . As you know from these exain ples , our constrMnts are not strong enough to identify the antecedent of qSan  , uniquely , lint makes safe interpretations . Moreover disambiguation done by these constraints i useflfl for further inference that will be done with comnion sense knowledge or with a special vocabulary like'kekkyokn  ( finally ) ' used in ( 7 )  . 
In case of $5 , namely iritransitive passive or ad-versity passive  , it is wellknown , i . e . \[ Gnnji 87\] that tbere exists a person who is affected by tile situation described by tile passive sentence  . An example sentence is the following . 
\[~ J affect trirria-n is in-are ( 9 ) \[ wife be dead-PASSIVE-tanoni\]-PAST but \] ~ expk an asimi-me-stnat  . 
shows adness not , ' Although his wife had gone ,  05~: , ,~> doesn't show a bit of sadness . 
The semantic role of this a . ffected l ) erson , ill (9) zero role : Gqj ~ t whose wiD was dead , is ~ tl'i ajfected . 
Tile intuitive interl ) retation that 6~*'i,=Gd . r ~ t (= motivated) , is expected by our constraints : $5 of Table . 3 and M1 of Table . '\] . On the contrary , lit case of $6 , namely transitive passive , geller a . lly we don't have an affecled , l to we verinseine context , a transitive passive form lnay require the role affecl cd which is inherent o adversity passive  . For instance , (10) ~ a . Uect saihn-ga . iill SUni wallet- SUFI3 steal-are-ta-PASSIVE-PAST'd ) a . ffect's wallet was sl . olen . ' hit his case , a . person whose wallet wass to len is not explicit but regarded as an affected  . Another case having an affected is that are la . tional noun is the subject of trlmsitive passive . Then a person who is in the relation exl ) ressed by the relational aolln is thought to be affected by that situation  , too . Here we take ' lnother ' , ' father ' , ' daughter ' , ' son ' , ' supervisor ' , and so fort has a relation M noun . A couple of exanlple sentences are t be following . 
(12 ) \[ kobnn-gayar-are ( ll ) \[ henchman- SUB3 attack-PASSIVE-tanode\]-PAST because \] ~ b <  , ntsikaesi-niitta . 
retaliate go-I ) AST ' Since his hench man was a . ttacked , the boss re-tMiated . '\[ kobun-gayar-are\[himchman-SUBJ attack-PA  . SSIVE-tanoni\]4b < q~teokomaneite-iru . 
-PAST but \] did nothing.
' Although his hench man was attacked , the boss didn't retaliate . ' qJ , < . q t who retaliated ( 1 1 )   ( or didn't retaliate ( 12 ) ) has a certain relation between the henchman who had been attacked  . For instance , q$<</t may be the boss of that henchnian . In ill ), since constraint $6 of T a Me . 3 and M1 of Table . 4 apply ,   ?5ant is an affected of attacking event described in tile subo Mina  . te clause . 
This interpretation coincides with native's intuition  . 
In sum , with these constraints , a constraints at-is fa . ction process in JO based parsing can be done locally and consequently very efficiently  . In other words , l ) rimarily a constraint satisfaction process of a subordinate clause can be done within the analysis of subordinate clause  , and tllat of the main clause can be done within it except for using motivaled whose value has already been constl:ained in the subordinate clause  .

In linguistic l ) lenomena , these observations are similar to the answer is I  , hal , : 1) We explicitly stat , e the seman l . ics of complex sentence as the relations a mot ~ g semt tnt  . ic roles .
