THE AUTOMATICALLY BUILT
UPHOMOGRAPHDICTIONARY
-A COMPONENTOFADY NAMICLEXICAL SYSTEM-
O . Introduction.
Ambiguous word forms ( often called " homonyms " or-in written language -" homographs "  ) are known as obstacles in many fields of computational linguistics  , especially in automatic documentation , content analysis or mechanical translation . In this respect two problems must be distinguished :  1  ) the detection of homographic word fonus in the text  , 2) their disambiguation by analysis procedures . 
This paper exclusively deals with the first problem  . 
1. The Detection Of Homographs.
1 . 1 . In current procedures for the detection of homographs two alternatives can be differentiated : i  ) Homographs are identified like monosemic word forms by segmentation and looking up in the standard lexicon  . Homographs are detected , if segments of text wordforms correspond with more than one lexicon-entry  . Lexicon-entries representing homographic items therefore need no special marking  . 
ii ) Homographs are identified by means of a special homograph dictionary  , which can be worked out in two versions : 1 ) the homograph dictionary contains the graphenfic shapes of all homographic word forms  ( full forms ) and their possible linguistic specifications . In this case no segmentation procedures are required  . 
2 ) the dictionary does not contain full forms but only the respective canonical forms  . A special marking gives information about other corresponding dictionary-entries and the extent of their overlapping  .

In both cases ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) the identification of homographic text word forms is separated from the identification of monosemic ones  . 
Procedures ( i ) and ( ii ) have some characteristic advantages and defects , which I will consider ather briefly . 
1 . 2 . As already pointed out the first method requires ( 1 ) a segmen-tational algorithm , with the help of which the wordforms of a text can be parsed into segments  ( e . g . stems and inflectional affixes ) ,   ( 2 ) an identificational component composed of a grapheme-sequence-comparing algorithm and the standard lexicon  ; thus it can be checked , whether a text segment detected by ( 1 ) is the expression-side of one ( or perhaps more ) lexical unit ( s )  . If this is the case , the content-side ( s ) of the corresponding unit ( s ) can be assigned to the text segment . 
1 . 2 . 1 . According to this conception the identification of wordforms would offer no problems in the following cases : i  ) the wordform represents only one sequence of segments  ( is monosemic )  , that means that each segment corresponds to one lexicon-entry : Germ  . :  . . . Okindes O . . . -/ kind /+ / es/KindEngl .  :  . . . O childs O . . . -/ child/+/s/childFrnc .  :  . . . Oenfant O . , . -/ enfant/+/121/enfantRuss . :  . . . Oreb~nok O . . . -/ reb~nok/+\[O/reb~nokii ) The wordform can be parsed into more than one set of segments  ( is homographic )  , and the possible readings show coinciding segment -boundaries : Germ  . :  . . .

If the entries are arranged in alphabetical order  , the respective units will immediately succeed one another  . 
1 . 2 . 2 . The detection becomes difficult however , if one wordform is parsed into more than one set of segments  ( is homographic )  , while the segment-boundaries in the possible readings are overlapping : Germ  .  :  . . . Ogetrieben O . . . -Itriebl+/ge-en/treiben

As cases of homography with overlapping segment -boundaries n the various readings are encountered quite frequently in languages with extensive inflection  ( e . g . German , French , Russian ), method 1 . 1 . ( i ) is not the best in any case . 
1 . 2 . 3 . The advantage of this method is above all to be seen in the fact that the identification of homographs can be managed automatically  , and that no special marking of the respective entries is necessary  . 
This is especially important with regard to dynamic lexical systems  , where the number of lexicon-entries and their specification can vary  ; new entries do not require a change of the detection procedure  . The disadvantage consists in the fact that monosemic and ambiguous word forms are submitted to the same procedure  , which amounts to an undue delay of the determination fmonosemic wordforms  . Multiple parsing with subsequent lexicon-look-up has always to be applied if the respective text wordforms contain grapheme sequences  , whidl correspond to inflectional affixes . Only after this can it be found out whether more than one plausible reading has resulted :  460 HEIN ZJ . WEBER

or only one reading is true :

Homographs are separately registered and marked according to their readings  ; thus a considerable acceleration of the identificational procedure is made possible  . Monosemic wordforms , the stems of which are listed up in the standard lexicon  , are identified more easily , as the segmentation adlexicon-look-up can already be stopped after assignment of one reading  . 
Ambiguous wordforms are specified more easily , as the extensive segmentation - and comparing -procedures do not have to be applied  ( as the various readings are registered in the homograph dictionary-version  1  . 1 .   ( ii )   ( 1 )  - ) or are reduced to a minimum ( as the respective lexicon-entries bear a special marking  , by which their homography can be derived- version  ( ii )   ( 2 )  - )  . These advantages however entail certain disadvantages : as a rule homograph dictionaries are built up manually and have to be manually complemented  , when the standard lexicon is extended ; the same has to be stated for the marking of lex -icon-entries  . A side from this trouble some and time-consuming business one cannot be sure that all homographies are registered or are marked exhaustively  . 
2 . The Automatically Built Up Homograph Dictionary . 
2 . 1 . In this paper a method will be outlined , in which the advantages of the first procedure are combined with those of the second one : the standard lexicon therefore can be extended automatically ' without delaying the identificational procedure  . The homograph dictionary is compiled by analysis of the standard lexicon  ; all stems representing homographic items are taken away from it and integrated into the homograph dictionary  . The same algorithm , which detects homogra-phies incorporated in the standard lexicon  , can be used to find out by analysis of both lexica  , whether new entries and all inflected forms represented by them are homographs  . If this is the case , they are re-gistered in the homograph dictionary , otherwise in the standard lexicon . Thus the number of entries in both lexica can be increased THEAUTOMATICALLY BUILTUPHOMOGRAPH DICTIONARY  461 automatically and the specifications of ambiguities in the homograph dictionary always correspond to the current state of information  .

2 . 2 . The standard lexicon can be characterized as follows : the lexicon-entries are " stems "  ; each stem representing a set of inflected forms , which is called a " paradigm " or " part of a paradigm "  . In order to abbreviate the graphemic assimilation of text wordforms to the graphemic shapes of lexicon-entries during the identificational procedure  , morphologically and syntactically determinated allomorphs have also been noted  . Stems of complex lexical units ( e . g . /kick Other bucket / , / zumO zugO komm /) are , however , ignored : stems of ( Get . ) graben(VRB ):/ grab/ , /grub/beipflichten:\[beipflicht / , pflicht / . . . 
stems of ( Eng . ) to sing:/sing / , / sang / , /sung/stems of ( Frc . ) mourir:/mour /,/ meur /,/ mort / . . . .
stems of ( Rus . ) reMnok:/reb~nok/,/reb~nk /, . . . 
2 . 3 . The homograph dictionary is built up by comparing selected entries of the standard lexicon  . In order to elucidate the comparing procedure we restrict ourselves to the coordination of just two lexicon-entries  . Two stems represent homographic nflected forms , if the following conditions are fulfilled : i ) The graphemic shapes of the stems belonging to the paradigms 
P1 and P2 are identical:
In this case homography exists , if any inflectional affixes cooccurring with the respective stems are homographic too:  462 HmNZJ . WEBER ii ) The graphemic shape belonging to the stem of paradigm P ~  , concatenated with a sequence G ~ , is homographic with the stem of paradigm P~:In this case the graphemic shapes of the cooccurring inflectional affixes have to correspond in the following way: 
G~(Vl)\G ,, ~ G(P ~).
Concerning Gk some restrictions have to be observed : iii  ) G ~ has to be homographic or partially homographic with any inflectional affix of the respective language : G~~G ~  , for G~as an element of the finite set ~ , , which contains all inflectional affixes . 
iv ) G ~ for its part must be cooccurring with the respective stem of the paradigm :=- G  ( Vx )  . 
The cooccurence of stem and affix is specified by the respective in-flection-class-marking of the lexicon-entry  . 
2 . 4 . Conditions ( i ) and ( ii ) determine the selection of stems .   ( iii ) prevents that all partially homographic stems in the lexicon are selected and examined  . Thus-for example-a coordination of the German stems/arm/Armand/armee/Armee is not permitted  ( though they are fulfilling condition ( ii ) : Gs ( PI ) ?/ . . . ee/~=G ~( P ~ . )), as the sequence G , =/ . . . eel does not fulfill the condition G , ~ G . 
iv ) further reduces the number of the selected stems to those cases  , where G(~_G , ) is cooccurring with Gs(Pl ) ( e . g . German/schwer/schwer and/schwert\[Schwertare not combined  , though both stems fulfill conditions ( ii ) and G ~ ( =/ . . . t /) fulfills condition ( iii ) ; but G ~ does not fulfill ( iv ) :/ . . . tl is not homographic with an affix co-occur-ring with/schwer /  ( ADJ ) ) . 
The relationship between the graphemic shapes of the affixes co-oc-curring with the stems of both paradigms is finally specified by the complementary part of condition  ( ii ) : G ( P1 ) \G k ~ G ~ ( P  ~ )  . E . g . the German stems/hoer/h6 ren and/gehoer/Geh6r ( SUB ) could be combined according to condition ( ii ) :/hoer/?/ge . . . / ~/ gehoer / . Moreover conditions ( iii ) and ( iv ) concerning Gk=/ge . . . /would be fulfilled :/ ge . . . /cG ~ and G ~(=/ ge-t/)---G ( Vl ) . But there is no inflectional THE AUTOMATICALLY BUILTUPHOMOGRAPHDICTIONARY  463 a fire/t/cooccurring with the stem/gehoer/of paradigm P ~  , which corresponds to/ge-t/in the mentioned way :/ get/\\[ge  . . . /~-/t/ . 
2 . 5 . These conditions determining the selection of lexicon-entries and their examination for homographic tems can be transferred into programmed instructions : start take ' stem of paradigm P ~ r tak c stem of ~ stem of P  , +~ .  , . , a-_para\[igm/3i + lstem of ~ .

Prerequisites for the outlined algorithm are : 1 ) a computerized stem-lexicon ; the entries , which have to be arranged in alphabetical order , must bear an inflection-class-marking , which makes it possible to generate all inflected forms represented by the respective stems :  , o #/ ficht\]:fechten , VRB , intl . -class 48/fichte /: Fichte , SUB , intl . -class 5 .   .   . 
2) A complete list of inflectional affixes , which bear the possible inflection-class-markings corresponding to those of the stems :  /0/ : SUB , intl . -classes . . . , 5  .   .   .   . 
VRB , intl.-classes ..., 48, ...
..,/st/:VRB , intl.-classes ..., 48, ...
2 . 7 . The selection of stems and the comparison of the cooccurring inflectional afftxes could be carried out in a slightly modified way  . As already pointed out , the selection of stems is in the main determined by the grapheme sequence G  ,   ( which specifies the graphematic overlapping of non-homographic stems  )  . Further restrictions concern the correspondence b tween Gk and the inflectional affixes cooccurring with the selected stems  ( see 2 . 3 . ( iii ) and ( iv) . As the inflection-class-markings of stems and affixes  ( which are similar ) are shortened distributional classifications , it is obvious to bring them into a system , according to the respective specifications of Gk . A matrix is built up by which it can be seen whether a G~-specification restricts the coordination of stems with certain inflection -class markings  . In this way the detailed examination and comparison of all cooccurring affixes  ( in accordance to condition 2 . 3 .   ( iv ) ) can be substituted by one single operation , at least in a good number of cases . 
THE AUTOMATICALLY BUILTUPHOMOGRAPHDICTIONARY coordinated Gk-specifications of  stem1 : intl . -classes of stem ,/ stem , G , = ~ . . . el .   .   . 

VRB1/SUB 5

VRB55/SUB5??o ++ ??.

VRB1:/stell/stellen ; ...
VRB 48:/ficht/fechten ; ...
VRB 55:/wies/weisen ; ...
This matrix forbids the coordination of two stems belonging to the classes VRB  48 and SUB 5   ( in this succession )  , though they may correspond in accordance to condition  ( ii ) :/ fie ht/x ~ . . . el ~= If , ehtel . 
On the other hand the coordination of two stems belonging to the classes VRB  1 or VRB 55 and SUB 5 is admissibile :/ stell/X ~ . . . el ~= lstelle/or/wies/x ~ . . . el ~ -/ wiese / . 
The building-up of such matrice seems to be a useful device  , as the number of G , -specifications in the respective languages ( German , French , Russian ) is limited . In German we have found out ten frequent and about thirty extremely rare G~-specifications  . In English homo-graphies with graphemetically overlapping stems are without that rather seldom  . 
2 . 8 . The conceived algorithm selects just two entries ( respectively their paradigms )  , which are examined for homographic wordforms . 
After the first cycle of selecting and comparing - as pointed out in  2  . 5 . -homographs , which are members of more than two paradigms ( e . g . 
466 UEIN Zj . w ~ R
German Oalben O : Album , Alba , Albe , Albx , Alb ~) , therefore , are not specified exhaustively :
Albumn Alba = alben
Album A Albe = alben
Albumfl Alb ~= alben
Album A Alb ~= alben
Albafl Albe=alben
Alba I "1 Albx = alben
Alban Alb2 = alben
Albefl Alb , = albe , alben
Albefl Alb ~= alben
AlblflAlb ~= alb , alben
In this example Oalben O is described as a member of altogether ten intersection sets  ( which are the results of the first coordination -cycle  )  . In a second cycle ( which will not be dealt within detail ) all intersection sets of the first cycle are examined for identical word forms  . 
O albenl3 now can be described as an intersection set of five paradigms : Album  I"1 Albafl Alben Alblfl Alb ~= alben
Albefl Albl = albe
AlblnAlb2 = alb)
The coordination of intersection sets in the second cycle is-as well as the coordination of paradigms in the first one-determined by conditions  , which are derived from the graphemic shapes of the respective stems  . In all probability stems like/album / , / alba / , / albe / , /alb/will represent at least one homographic wordform  , while stems like/album / , /alge/ , / alibi / , /altar/will not . 
2 . 9 . As the outlined method of building up a homograph dictionary is  , in the main , using facts of the expression-side of lexical units  , it can be applied to various lexicon-types . The content-sides of the respective entries ( i . e . stems ) can be are it her semantically , syntactically or otherwise relevant information .
