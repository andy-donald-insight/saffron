Tile purpose of this paper is to report on research on a parallel parser based on the principles and constraints of Government-Binding Theory  . The parser outputs a set of licensing relations , notably thematic or 0-role assignments and antecedent/anaphor and other binding relationships  , The primary goal of the system ix as a liaguistics tool for exploring concurrency and autonomy amongir ~ odules of tile theory  . 

Parse , 's based oil Government-Binding ( GB ) Theory have been tile subject of an unlber of research progranlmes  . ~While they all share a collln lonlinguistic framework  , the design goals and underlying parsing strategies are varied  . Some are tools forew duating competence and/or performance models of language and others remain neutral with respect to psychological reality  . 
The parsing engines range from bottom-up to top -downtoinix-nlode methods and fronl backtracking to deterministic algorithms  . Howe\er , they all approach parsing as a sequential process  , and all hough there have been a number o\[' efforts oil parallel parsing  ( of . /I . \[uang and Guthrie 1986/ , /Matsmnoto 1986/ , and/Waltz and Pollack 1985/) , few are linguistically-oriented and none arc GB -based  . Since GB is a highly modular system of components  , development of parallel parsers incorporating the theory allows for at'cmnal examination i to the computational aspects of GB-modules and their interfaces  . 
SCO PEANDOBJECTIVES
In oMer to explorettle relations llips between GB -subsystems and their realization in a parallel parser  , a development goal is one of modularity ill that each GB  . -module should be transparently encoded .   2 This perlnits investigation of processes within and across GI : ~ component so be made explicit  , Since the focus of tile parscr is on GB principles and since GB itself is a theory of core graln mar  , file coverage of the parser is restricted to a subset of English that reflect syntactic processes explained by the theory  . 
While it may be premature to speak of psychologically-real parallel parsers  , many of the cognitive presuppositions that are the basis of the work of/Berwick and Weinberg  1984/  . /Marcus 1980/ , and/Milne 1983/have been the motivation for several of the design decisions that have been incorporated in the system  . 
More specifically , the parser is deterministic and has the capability of delaying certain actions  , e . g . , projection of nodes and resolution of lexical ambiguity  , until more information is available , rather than computing competing parses or backtracking uncontrollably  . These features together with the goal of transparent representation fGB principle should provide a foundation for future research into tile cognitive plausibility of parallel parsers  . 
ANIMPLEMENTATIONNOTE
The parser is being developed in PC-PARLOG : requiring an IBM PC  , XT , A Torcompatible machine with title as t 512Kb of memory and two floppy disk drivcs or a hard disk  . 
Although tile in lplen lentations in mlates para ! lelism by at in ~ eshar-ing scheduler  , tile parse run ~ on a single processor n lach in c and  , therefore , lacks true parallelism , t to wever , insofar as the purpose of the parser is to specify concurrency of  G13-subsystems at a high level of abstraction , tile analyses are internls of compulalional processes rather than processors  . As parallel haMw are becomes tnore readily available  , a valuable By-prod-uct of this research is that tile system coukl be ported to parallel logic machines with little or no additionalel Tort  . 

PARLOG t'q ~ arallelLogic '+ ) is a parallel declarative program-mmg language based on logic  ( /Conlon 1989/ , /Gregory 1987/ , and/Shapiro 1988/) . " File basic for nl of a clause is ( I ) head <-- guard : body where tile head is a goal r ( tl . . . . . tn ) and both guard ( optiom f l ) and hod ) (obligatory ) are conjunctions of goals . Each procedure n lust be preceded by a mode declaration specifying input  ( '? ) and output ( A ) arguments . Sequential xl paralel colit lctio a ( AND ) and sequentialnd parallel disjunction ( OR ) are represented by "'&" ,  " , " ,  "';" ,  "' . ", respectively . 
THE PARSER
The parser combines top-dov , n and bottom-up strategies and recovers a set of licensing relations directly  ; phrase structure is considere derivative and is not cornputed  . + The basic operations rely on the current governing category as the left bounded context and are deterministic n the sense that once a node is typed or licensed it cannot be altered  . The output of the parser is a constructed list of structures  ( 2 ) CP = lcp ( C ( mlplementizer )  , extarg ( Subject ) , infl(lnflelenlent ) , predicate ( V erb ) , in targ1 ( Object1) , in targ2 ( Object2) , indirecL . arg(PP ) l , where cp represents he complementizer phrase , I he head of the CP or S-bar , inll denotes the inflectional elemenl , tile head of S , and predicate is tile verb . Tilestruclure sext_arg , int_arg_l , and int__arg2 are tile arguments of the verb , the lirst being the external argument ( subject ) and the last two being tile ( direct ) internal arguments ( objects )  . The indireet_arg is a prepositional phrase ( PP ) that a verb may license and there may be several of these structures depending on the lexical specifications of the verb  . While the cp , ext_arg , infl , and predicate are obligatory , the internal and indirect arguments Irre contingent upon the  0-grid of the verb and , therefore , are optional . 
The basic objects of the system are nodes where a node is a structure of the form xp  ( Word , x_bar(Features) , lndex ) . Word is a lexical item , an empty category PRO , trace , or variable , or an empty complementizer or inflectional element  , and Featm'es represents he type of the node in terms of x-bar features_+N  , _+V . 
Every node receives a unique index unless it is bound  ( coindexed ) to another via Binding or Control Theory . Each of the terms of ( 2 ) are nodes except for the arguments which area list of nodes that represent the specifier  , head , and complement structures . Specifiers may be determiner or adjectival phrases  , and compleme uts may be PPs or , in the case of retative clauses , aCP , which would be reflected in another list whose structure is analagous to  ( 2 )  . 
THELEXICON
In accordance with GB Theory , the lexicon plays : tcent , ' alrole . 
Each lexical item contains the idiosyncratic features of the lexeme and they direct many actions of the parser  . The lexicon is a database of PARLOG assertions which may be searched in parallel  . A small subset of the lexicon is ( 3 ) model exeme ( item? , x_bar ^ , feature ^) . 
a.lexeme(man,\[x_bar(nl , vo)l,\[pl(men)\]).
b . lexeme(put,\[x_bar(no , vl )\],\ [ . . . ,s(puts ) , ing ( putting ) , 0- grid(int_arg_1 , locative_PP ) , , i . \] ) . 
c . lexeme(plan,\[x . _bar(no , vl ), xbar(nl , vo )\],\ [ . . . . 0-grid ( proposition ) , tenseless , subject control ,  . . .  \]) . 
The first te , ' m of each lexeme is the lexical entry and the second term is a list of structures of the form x bar  ( FI , F2) , where F1 and F2 are x-bar primitives , _+N , +_V , with " l " and "0" denoting "+" and "-" , respectively . Lexically ambiguous items , e . g . , (3) c . , have more tlm nonex-bar structure . The third term is a list of symbols and structures that depend on the lexical item and its type  , i . e . , x-bar features . For instance , as (3) a . illustrates , nouns ( x_bar(nl , vo ) ) have a plural form as It member in their list of features while verbs  ( xbar ( no , vl )) have morphological derivatives , e . g . , participial forms or ing , in their features list as (3) b . 
shows . Verbs also have 0-grids which characterize argument structures and other features indicating specifics of complement structure such as tense less  ( infinitival ) subcatcg orizations or control criteria , e . g . , subject_control((3) c . ) . " In the currant version of the parser , derivational morphology is minimal . 
THE PARSING ENGINE
The basic actions of tile parser lrre to identify gaps  , to construct maximal projections , and to license these projections , and these are encoded by tile respective procedures  , detect gap , project , and license . The parsing loop is called recursively until tile sentemial input  , a list , is exhausted . During a parse , governing categories are produced and used as left-bounded context for " certain procedures before being shunted to the list that will ultimately represent the output  . 
GBMODULES
The GB-modules of Trace , Binding , Control , and Bounding Theories are incorporated in the parser  , especially in goals detect_gap and license . Detect_gap identifies the presence , if any , of an implicit elemeut . This may be an argument , viz . , trace , PRO , or variable , or a nonlexical item , viz . , an empty complementizer or inflectional element . Afi'agment ~' of the PARLOG code for detect_gap is  ( 4 ) mode detect gap ( sentence? , gov__cat^ , empty_cat^) . 
a . detect_gap(\[WordlWords\] , Govcat , Empty cat ) < -- passive_morphology(Word , Govcat):
Empty_cat = trltce.
b . detect gap(\[WordlWords\] , Gov_cat , Empty cat ) <--- Word = to , subjectless in fcomp ( Govcat):
Empty_cat = pro.
Tile first relation has a guard to determine if the current word has passive morphology  . Informally , the guard passive morphology checks the inflectional element of the CtuTent governing category fro " a form of BE and  , in parallel , determines if the current word is a verb ot ' the passive form  . If the guard succeeds , then the output substitution is complete with Empty_eat being unified with trace  . In (4) b . , the guards provide checks with the current token  ( Word ) and governing category for the features of the verb and possible presence of an overt subjec ~ in order that detect gap may detect a PRO  . The rest of the specifications for detect gap have similar strategies for finding variables and empty inflections and complementizers  . Each of these clauses are computed in parallel together with one that determines an absence of an empty category in tile current position of the sentence  . 
The next goal in parse is project , which constructs a maximal projection , xp(ltem , Type ) . In the case that Item is lexicalty ambiguous , project has calls to lexical disambiguation routines which are invoked in parallel to attempt a resolution  . 
The goal license indexes and assigns 0-roles to arguments of predicates . Binding Theory ( /Cllomsky 1981/ ) has three principles , frequently labeled A , B , and Cm the GB literature , that specify-coindexation procedures for irnaphm's  , pronominals . 
and referential ( R-) expressions , respectively . Since the principles are independent , they are canclidates for parallel execution . Thus , Binding is specified in the system as ( 5 ) modebinding ( proj? , gov_cat? , indexed_proj^) . 
binding ( Proi , Govcat , lndexed_proj ) +- is anaphor ( Proj ) : principle a ( Proj , Govcat , Indexed_proj ) . 
binding(Proj , Govcat , Indexed proj ) + -- is pronominal ( Proj ) : principle_b ( Proj , Govcat , ludexed_pmj ) . 
binding ( Proj , Gov_cat , lndexed_pmj ) + -- isr_cxp ( Proj ) : principle c ( Proj , Gov_caI , Indexed proj ) . 
The purpose of the guards is to determine tile argument type of a particular argument  ( Proj ) which then invokes a call tn a specific method of indexing in accordance with Binding Theory  . 
(There is a numerical indexing scheme that is embedded in each principle  . ) The result of binding is a node , Indexed_proj , that has an index associated with it . 
The other major part of license is the assigm nem of  0-roles   . The parser assigns 0-roles to the respective arguments of the predicates based on their  0-grids   . Tilebinding and ( )- assignment procedures together comprise the licensing procedure  . Their communication channels are being explored and stream AND parallelism appears promising  . 

ANEXAMPLE
For the sentence (6) John was persuaded to leave.
the parser produces (7)\[ cp(emp , cp ,  1 ) , ext_arg(john , x_bar(nl , vo) , 2) , infl(was , infl , 3) , predicate ( persuaded , x_bar(no , vt ) , 4) in targ_1 ( trace , xbar(nI , vo ) , 2) , int_arg2(cpl , cp , 5) , \[ cp_l(emp , cp , 5) , extarg(pro , xbar(nI , vo ) , 2) , infl(to , infl , 6) , predicate ( leave , xbar(no , v1) , 7)\]1 , which illustrates PP , O and trace detection and binding . 
FUTUREDIRECTIONS
The primary focus of the experimental parser will be to include wider coverage withinst GB -framework  , including adjuncts , and to examine psychological spects of concurrent language processing  . 

The investigation i to the concurrent aspects of GB Theory is still in the embryonic stages  . Nevertheless , early result seem to indicate that such research may yield significant insights into parallel parsing and human sentence processing  .
