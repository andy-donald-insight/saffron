Table 1: Examples of features that dictionary usage notes adduce in word differentiation  ( adapted fl : om\[l ) i Marco and Hirst 1993\] )  . 
Relation comparison . The primary property is relation comparison : pairs of near-synonynts can be COln pared and judged as more  , or less , similar to each other than others . For example , there is something similar in the relationship between stingy/frugal and between j'at/plump  . In each case , the first word ( stingy , fat ) is pejorative while the second ( frugal , plump ) has a nuance of being admirable or attractive . This relationship would not be maintained if , for example , we replaced fat/plump by rotund/plump . 
Relation expressions . The second relation property is relation cz pressions  , which refers to people's a hility to use comnmn words and phrases to express near-synonymic relations  . For exam-pie , mistake and era ' or hoth refhr to something done incorrectly or improperly  , but mistake is more general than erro % ~ ceording to the usage  , to t ( ; in the OALD . 
Relation complexity .   2 The property of relation complexity refers to the need to represent different relations between the same pair of near-synonyms  , on more than one level of complexity ; we nee ( l to t ) eablet so in chl denuances that are relevant o a given situation and ignore others  . 
Relation creativity . Chaflin and llerr mannoh serve that " the production and recognition of ' relations is a creative ability "  , so that the relation between two words " can he readily identified although the reader may never have considered the relation of these particular terms be-tbre "\[ p  .  292\] . We wilt show tha , t relatione re-ativit 9 is equally necessary to a theory of near -synonymic relations  , l ' brexample , the relation of 2Chatf in and ' Jlerrtnann \[1988\] use the somewhat misleading terln relation ambiguity  , bug we believe it is n to reaccurate and less confusing to use the term relation complexi@  . 
arrange/organize 3 can be recognized as one that contrasts correctness with functionality  , and we might then detect his same relationship for other pairs of near-synonyms  ( e . g . , trim/shave ) . 
In summing up the importance of these relation properties to a theory of semantic relations  , Chaffmand Herrmann state that " these diverse phenomena must be explained by theories of relations " and " we will tind that in order to explain relations it is necessary to assume that relations are normally composed of more primitive l-ements that account for their characteristics and for people's abilities to make judgments about them "\[ p  .  292\] . We , believe these observations are equally true of theories of plesionymic relations and we will show that a relation-element theory of near -synonymy will account for these relation properties  . 
3.2 Theoretical assumptions
In developing their theory of semantic relations , Chaflin and Herrmann make the following )' e , presentationals sumptions \[ paraphrased from pp  . 293-294\]: ? A relation R , between 1 ; wo concepts x and y is composed of a set o\[" dyadicreb ~ tioneh  , ,ments (& ,  . . . ,&) : ~: l~?j--~(E ~ , .   .   . , i , ; , )4 ?

A row is angry and may involve shouting , usually tbrash or t time .   .   . A row can also take place between public figures or organizations  . 
\[\[' here are two ways we can construct he relation between quarrel and row  , depending on whether the argument is between people or inanimate organizations : quarrel/~vw :   ( Ibrceful , fbr lnalji , emotional ji ( vector i aljl ) ) quarrel/row : ( forceful , \[ nan\[matell ( for lnalji ) ) The tirst relation states that row is more formal and more emotional  ; quarrel is more force fll . It also indicates that the greater emotion of a row is linked to a difference in scale  , the vectorial element , which in this case refers to the diff > rent lengths of time of a quar ~ vl and a row  . The second relation notes that a row can in w ) lveinan-intate entities but , if it does , then the effect is more formal . Thus , we can have different relations between plesion yms  , depending on the different usages of the words . 
By following the same kind of approach , we can ( : on struct relations for some other pairs of near -synonyms : flv wn /  , qrirn aee : ( general ( formal ji , torcefn\]jl ) mistake/blunder : ( general ( formal ji , for nefi ~ lji , careless ji ) ) fat/plump : ( general ( force f if l ( polit qi ( attractive jl ) ) ) ) We observe that the same or similar relation ( : an hold between different pairs of near -synonyms  , for example , ask/beseech , thin/ernaeiated , and ffow ~@ rirnace . This is mta . l-ogous to the case of semantic relations , which , as Chaffin and Herrmannnote , are readily recognizable and nameable . Near-synonymic relations cannot be so easily labelled  , but we can still see that some basic set of relations might be defined and could be used to construct new relations  , l ? k ) r example , we showed that the relation between ask and be seech couhl be represented by the following structure : ask/beseech :  ( geuera \] ( for xnal . ii , force fulji ) ) We saw how this basic relation could also apply to thin/emaciated and fl'own/grimace  ; this sug- . 
gests that , lor lexical-choice processing , we will want to keep a catalogue of existing relations from which new relations could be built  . Another pair of near-synonyms , mistake and blunder , share the same distinctions , excep that blunder is often the result of carelessness  ( OALD )  . So we add to the existing specification to obtain the following relation : re\[sick  , c/blunder : ( general ( formal \[ l , fo : r ceful j ~ , careless ji )) Imstty , dependencies can lead to quite complicated relations  , as iu the case of fat/plu'mp , where the distinction of politeness ( int politeness ) is related to different dependencies for each near-synonynuthe nuances of force and impoliteness are interdependent  , as are those of politeness and a . ttrantiveness . 
6 The relation properties
In Section 3 . 11 , we set out a list of relation 1 ) roper-ties that any theory of i , ear-synonymic relations should be able to account lot '  . Intlhissection , we discuss how a relation-element approach addresses these issues  . 
Relation comparison . By breaking down the relations between ptesion yms into relation elements  , we can obtain a finer degree ot'discrimination between similar words for the task of lexical choice in generation  . As we discuss in \[ l)i-Marco , \[ first , and Stede 1993\] , many of the semantic distinctions between plesion yms do not \] end themselvns to neat  , taxonomic differentiation ; ratl her , they are fuzzy , with plesion yms often having an area of overlap . For exa , mple , the boundary between forest and wood is vague , and there are some situations it , which either word might be equally appropriate . Thei ) roblem is compounded when we are dealing with more than one language  , for the % veakpoint ' between small and large tracts of trees is different for different languages  . For multilingual generation , we can compare plesionyms in different languages in terms of their different elelnent structures  , so that it shouhl be easier to choose the particular word iu a particular language that tits a given situation  . 
Relation expressions . We have seen thai ; o\[: ten the distinctions between near-synonyms need to be expressed using common words and phrases  . 
But we have shown that there are ways of expressing relations using fairly common vocabulary to representhese distinctions  . The ease of relation identilic , ~ tion may contribute towards relation veritication : we  ( ' an anticipate that psychological tests , of the so N , Chaffin and IIerrmann carried outlbr semantic relations  , could be used to verify our relations and relation elements  , as we can meaning fidly and precisely represent the subjects ' intuitions about the distinctions between near-synonyms  . 

Relation complexity . R , elations may need to be de . scribed~1; more = than one h wel of c <) ml ) lex-ity , so that the distinctions between two words may be identified in more than one way  . We have shown how a relation-elent eut approacll allows us to detine difl'erent relation structures for the same  1  ) air of neaa : synonyms ( e . g . , quarrel/row ) . 
Relation creativity . We have noted in previous work\[DiMarco , \] lirst , and S1 ; ede1993\] that the rel ) resentation of 1 ; he distinctions be = tween near-synonyms would seeln to reqllire a constrained  , bul ; not finite , vocal mlary . With a relation-element approa <- h , we have seen how a hasi ( : set of relations might be constru ( :te ( I ; new relation eleme . n . tsnlay bea < lde(\[ , but we may be able to incorporate them into existing relations  , so that tim('al ; a logue of relations need not grow uncontrollably . Tbus , we ( ; an \] ) rodue e new relations by elaborating on existing , wellknown relations or by concatenating existiug relations\[p  .  3221 . 
7 hnp lement ing near - synonymic re la t ions We are currently invesl  , igating ( lilferent systems for implementing a relational theory o\[near:synonymy  . The first system that we al'e looking at is Word Ne  (  ; \ [ Miller et al : 1990) , whi < ; hs('emsp~rti ( ; uhtrly relew ~ nt as words are organized both by semantic relations and by " synsets "  ( synonym sets )  . 
WordNet contains delinitions of uomls , verbs , and adjectives ; for now , we are COile ei it rooting on there I > resent a , tion of adje (: tiwtl near-synonyms . In keel ) log with the l ) hilosol ) hy of WordNet , we envisage the use < ) f ai ) o inter for each type ( >\[" near-synonymic relation in our cal ; alogue , so that we might tel ) resent the relations betwee . nplesion yms as follows : rl : ( genera \ [ ( favourable ji ) ) r2 : ( general ( fbl:tnaljl , force fitl . ii )) r3: ( general ( favon , ' abhb force fulji )) Currently , the coding of a , synse . t of adjectives wouhllook as l bllows in WordNet : thin  , slender , erase . fated , thin 1 , & where " thinl , & " indicates that members of this sylt set are related to the '  ( :< ) n ( :e . l > t ' thin/I > y the simila , rity relation . 
We can imagine iml ) < ) siug additional structure on a synset and malting use of a catah  ) gue of near-synonymic relations to obtain the f < ) llowing coding : \[ thin , sh ; nder , rl \] , \[thin , eros . elated , r21 , \ [ shin<let , emaciated , r3\] , thin 1 , & s 8In WordNet , square brackets are used to indicate a lexical While such a representation of near synonymic relations would be very easy and natural in Word  . 
Net , it relies on the solution of a uunll ) er of chahlenging probh ~ ms , speeili (' ally , how to generate a comt > lete set of near-synonymic reh L tione lenl  ( utts , and how to define a constrained and reusa , blecat-a Jogue of nea . r-synonymic relations .
