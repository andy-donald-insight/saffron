Mechanics 1 Translation.
The immediate effect of the recently issued
Report on Computers in Translation and
L ~ istics . LANGUAGE ~ MACHINES ~ J3 has been to spread the view that there is no future at all for research in Mechanical Translation as such  ; a view which contrasts sharply with the earlier , euphoric view that ( now that disc-files provide computers with indefinitely large memory-systems which can be quickly searched by random-access procedures  ) the Mechanical Translation research problem was all but " solved "  . 
It is possible , however , that this second , ultra-despondent view is as exaggerated as the first one was  ; all the more so as the ~ is written from a very narrow research background withoutiny indication of this narrowness being ~ iven  . 
F ~ r example , an M . T . Thesaurus has never yet been put on a machine ; (_ ~ and the analogy between M . T . and Information-Retrieval has never yet been explored  ,   ( yet retrieving a translation in response to a user's request is basically the same as retrieving any other piece of information in response to a user's request ~~ No mention  , moreover , is made in the Re~ort of the work of . 2 . 
(e . g . ) Dolby and Resnikoff in analysing the nature ~ structure of natural language dictionaries  , nor is any recommendation made that more of this evidently necessary work should be done  . MoTeO~?/~~he need for basic research into the true problem posed by the ambiguity and extensibility of individual language-signals of any order of length  , and the connection of this with other learning -problems and character-recognition-problems ~ has never yet been faced  . In fact , the situation is worse ; a particular application has been pronounced useless and/or impossible before the general field of examining the basic semantic nature of human communication has been created  . 
II .   R0commendation : do not look at the theoretic complexities of current researches into language-problems : look rather at the techuolo ~ ical advances which have alread  2 been made . 
Thus the basic recommendation given in the Report , nalely that practical research into Mechanical Translation should be discontinued  , while present , very narrow and fragmentary trends of " pure " theoretic linguistics research should be supported  , can be queried both ways round . For the advances in this field are precisely comlmg from the technologies  , as the Report itself shows , and that in several areas i ) Thus computer-tTpe-setting , in which hyphenation can be done with a " logic " , that is , without a dictionary , is now an accomplished fact ~ ii ) within information retrieval , mech-anized retrieval systems of increasing sophistication and efficiency  , are being constructed for practical use at Universities and within industry : iii  ) synthetic speech considered as synthetic message , -passed over in the Report because created by telephone engineers and not by linguists  , - is making great strides a head ; iv ) high-level programming languages increasingly operate more llke natural languages  , so that the machine can pick up and process something more like the user's normal way of thinking  ; v ) the Mannheim and Luxembourg machine-aided translation-systems are acknowledged in the ~ to save  40  -  60 peremat of a translators time ;  6 ( ~3 and vi ) research in automatic character-recogniti0n has now reached such a point that consideration of the extent to which this will slash M  . T . costs and increase M . T . 
usefulness should have not been ignored . C ~ III . Report on an actual experiment in man-alded M . T . 
The experimental work to be reported on in this paper and which is still in progress  , is the . 3 . 
development of a computer-aided procedure for the full translation of one single paragraph of governmental report-style Eng lish into governmental-report-style Canadian French  , to be made in such a way that the translation actually produced accounts for the non-li teral translation which was actually made by the official Canadian Government T rans lator  . 
The philosophy behind this research is that before employing automatic-translation - devices on a large scale  , ~ ou . have got to understand what translation is your self ! Just as before building al in er-smoke-funnel you have got to unders t and wind-flow  . You may not in the end use , to assist translation , all the mechanical procedures which you deve lop in order to understand translation  , but you have got to know what these are6mechan ic ~ lly speaking , you have not got to be continually surprised and taken a back by what the human translator actually does  . 
~ventheamount of experimentation which we have performed so far hasi ~ ufficed to conv inceus that nobody does knww  , in terms of automatic procedures , what translation is . So-called ~? ~ pEegrams ~ up to now , though they have performed e ~ more or less sophisticated feats in bi-lin ~ A alt ransformation of individual words and of individual constructions  , have never in the true sense of the word , translated anything . 
We ~ avem ~ w , ~ wever , started to put on a machine a more realist ic translation-model of the following form  . 
The model draws on ii ) iii ) iv ) and v ) of the tech-no logical devices mentioned above  , i ) As is standarg practise now on Information Retrieval  , the model uses a Thesaurus . This Thesaurus , however , is not merely an Information-Retrieval -type Thesaurus of terms  , but a " Roget's Thesaurus " type of technical d ictionary  , though of a novel kind . ii ) The retrieval-procedure works by using as its " requests " a unit longer than the word  , and which has been called a " phrasing " ( Frzrh~hmiaue )  ; ~ a computer-program , ( written J . Dobson for the TitanComputer at Cambridge University Mathematical Laboratory  ) now exists which derives phrasings from Written text  ( see appendix A ) iii )  . The user is online to a computer , on which the whole Thesaurus is Stored ; and here acts with this Thesaurus by means of question - and ~ answer routines operating in real time which are programmed into the machine by us ~the very sophisticated programming language T  . R . A . C . ~9~-Anlv ) , the experiment presupposes the validity of the result that  , in operation , the computer-stored dictionaries at Luxembou2~an ~ Trier ( to which the user is not online and with which he cannot therefore react  ,  )  . 4 . 
already , in spite of these limitations save 4060% of the translators ' time . It is inferred from this that on-line use of more sophisticated dictionaries by man-machine interaction in the convers at ional mode is the rightway  , from now on , for M . T . research to go . 
III . The Basic Principle of the Man-Machine interact !on  . 
The input to the machine is a stressed and contoured phrasing  , i . e . a phrasing with some stresses marked and minimal syntactic naming of the constituent words  . 
Research to produce this input mechanically , by a phrasing-stresser-and-parse ~ is currently being supported by the Office of Scientific and Technical Information  , London ; at present the program ( Mark II ) segments the text into phrasings mechanically , but does not either mark the stressed words or provide any snytactic naming  . 
( see Appendix A ) . In the mini-demonstation of the ~ an-maahine interaction  , therefore ,   ( the only one which is already operational as a machine  , ) the operator at present types in a single phrasing at a time minus the stressed words  , which have been pre-marked on his text . Thus , he does not type in a complete phrasing , but what we have called a phrasing-frame .   ( Later the machine will compute the phrasing-frame from the text ~ Examples of assorted phrasing -frames are given below :

N . B . Other markers e . g . ~he marker J to set in operation aroutine to interconnect syntactiaally connected phrasings will be discussed in a further publication On receiving the phrasing-frame  , the machine questions the opea ~ or in order to make him specify further  , from his general knowledge of the text and of its subject  , what the cOn text of the particular phraslng-frame is  . 
The example given below , in which is progressively specified the correct French translation of an English ~ erb of motion  ( one of the notoriously difficult ~ lish forms to translate into French  ) shows how complicated this questioning can be  . Not more than three rounds of questioning are allowed  , and when the operator has produced his spec if ication  , the unique correct trans " latio ~ f the frame is stored in the immediate-access store ~  . ~ chine ( see Appendix B ) . In the example set out below , however , the differ ~ French translations of all possible answers obtainable under Round II and Round III of the interaction are set out immediately underneath the English statements which the machine would actually print out on the console  , in order to show the underlying reason for the whole enterprise  .

The Machine prints out the translation ;
ILPRITL'AVION POURLAFRONTI~RE~hind this particular way of making an online system teract with an operator the relies a strategy  , ahy Dothes~s and a ~ ros~ect , V . The strategy is at all costs to avoid post-editing  ; but to allow maximal pre-processing of the input text by the machine interacting with the operat  . or , all the question-and-answ erroutines being in the operator's native language  . 
Th@argument against post-editing ( as the U . S . Report conclusively shows ) is that it is either mechanicale . g . the resolution of French gender-concord- in which case the machine itself can be programmed to do it-or it is creative and /or intuitive  ; in which cgse it cannot be done at all wi thout extensive reference back to the input text ~ ho could interpret " Shakespeare Overspat "   , which was the title of a Russian " Pravda " article as translated by the U  . S . Air Forceccmputer ~ The real meaning was " Shakespeare is now a backnumber "  )  , in which case the posteditor might as well have translated the whole text h ~ self in the first place  . 
To avoid postediting , however , the output produced by a man-machine reactive M . T . program has either got to be a blamk space ( when the program fails )  , or a unique translation which is known to be correct  . Now uniqueness of output can be brutally produced  , as everybody knows ~ programming the machine only top rint out one egany set of alternatives  . Correctness , however , can only be achieved by the target-language translation having been approved beforehand by the operator  , from ~: cues which the machine gives him , or which he gives the machine-i ~ hisown language  ; i . e . in the source language . The real use , therefore , of the three-stage question-and-answ erroutine exemplified above  , is that it enables an English man with a console but who does  . 8 . 
not know any French to produce a unique and correct idiomatic French translation of an English text r provided that he is prepared to take the trouble to preprocess the English text so that it is finally restated in a Frenchified sort of way  . After this the machine can of course transcribe it into French  . 
In other words , a machine-aided translation program basically consists - a  ) of programming the machine to pick upt ~ e ambiguities in the source language which the target-language will not toler ste  ( not the other way round ) and of making the operator produce the additional information which will resolve them  . 
Take , as example , the phrasing/for as t and b2 for ~ . 
This looks technical and unambiguous in the English  , but comparative examination of bilingual text showed that it translated into French  ( and in the same document ) as either i ) /d ' uneforced ' urgence ~ i . e . /" of a nemer ~ encyforce/oril ) /pour une for ceder 6 serve/i . e . /" for a reserve force "/ , according to sophisticated considerations of context  . 
Therefore , when the operator types the technical term STANDBYFORCE into the machine  , in order to fill up the gaps in the phrasing -frame/FORA  . . . . . . . . . . \ [ NS ~\ ] \[ AdjJ the machine has got to answer him back: 
DOY OUMEAN
AANEMERGENCY FORCE
BARESER VEFORCE
The operator then has to choose , and type back into the machine the alternative he wants  , after which the machine can make the translation . 
b ) 8 imil & z ~ , , . ~way must m be found ~ e femab ~ ng the machine topic k up  , from cues in the source language , the metaphors and idioms which the target- language will not tolerate/and to ass is t the operator to rephrase the stretch of text concerne ~ d ~ in terms which the target-language will tolerate ~ he difference between idioms and metaphors is that idiems can be mechanically picked up and matched by an idiom dictionary  , whereas metaphors can't . 
c ) Similarly again , the machine must be programmed to pick up , from the source language input , the constructions which the target-language will not tolerate  , and assist the operator to transform these into constructions which the target-language will tolerate  ( e . g . to turm English passives into FreL~ch actives , and the adjectives of English adjective-noun strings into French post-positioned prepositional phrases  )  . 
Thus the whole translating work , really , is done within the source language . Once you can preprocess your English input into a Frenchified shape in the respects a  )  , b ) , c ) , above , the machine can transform this Frenchified English  , with no trouble at all , into elegant French . 
The strategic hope , of course , is that by analysing the print outs produced by a large number of sequences of such machine-man interactions  , in translating many types of texts , we shallultimately learn how to make the machine answer  , as well as ask , some of the rounds of questions ,   ( as is already being done in a whole range of machine " edit " programs  )  , so that the machine shall progressively become able to do more of the Frenchifi-cation process for itself  ; thus finally producing ,   ( if the machine ever becameable completely to take over  ) exceedingly slow but reliable machine translation  , -which could ~ subsequsntly again ) be speeded up . 
Before further discussion of the extent to which this strategic hope is a real hope and haw much a merepious aspiration  , i . e . the prospect , I will now set out the k v pothesis ( as opposed to the strategy ) of the experiment . 
VI . The hypothesis which the translation model gives is the following : A Translation consists of the pairing of a phrasing  , P7' in Language A , with another ~ hrasing , P2 ~ in Language B , in such a way that PI~ ~1~forms an analogy with PIA , in a sense of " analogy " which cambe ostensively defined in t terms of the model  . 
Thus translating a phrasing into another language is no different  ,   ( according to this translation model ) from defining it , producing a parallel-phrasing to it , reiterating or otherwise further specifying it , in the same language . ~ The advantage of the model is that unambiguous criteria of the formation of such a pairing can be given  . 
Por any response given by the operator to a machine-ques ~ tion will form such a  , pair : the first member of the pair will be the original phrasing  , ( in English ) , the second the chosen machine-specification ( called by us a template )   . 10 . 
also in English . Then another pair will be formed whenever the machine translates the operator's final choice of template into French  ; the first member of the pair in this case , will be the final template chosen , and the seo on dmember will be the translation into French  , with the stressed words translated and inserted into their correct places  . Then again , an intermediate pair may be formed of which each member is a template  ; the first member of such a pair will be a more abstract template chosen at the first round of man-machine interaction  , while the second member of it will be the more concrete template chosen by the operator at the Second round of man-machine interaction  ; and so on recursively . 
Any such pairing formed by the translation model , whether between English phrasing and template , or between template and template , or between template and French phrasing , we shall call a semantic square . A philosophic discussion of the notion of semantic square is given in another publication  ~  . 
A semantics au are ( in terms of thls model ) consists of the pairing of any two linguistic sequences  P1 an . dP2 , PI and P2 each having the following characteristics . 
i ) each has two stressed segments ( which when PI is paired to P2 , form points of the square ) . 
ii ) each has these embedded in some phrasing-frame , ( which , when PI is paired to P2 forms the fram . _ . ._! of the square) . 
iii ) each has been selected as synonymous@ith the other at least once  , either by the operator or by the machine . 
Thus , according to the model , translation consists of sequential semantic -square forming  , the sequence of semantic squares thus formed continuing until it is brought to an end by the machine printim ~ out a square which has a target -language phrasing as its second ~ amber  . 
To make all this clearer , let us further develop the example of man-machine interaction given above > by assumin ~ that the phrasing to be translated is/HEWENT to the ol ~ q ~/  , To translate this , the operator types in/HE . . . EAST ~ a DVER3 ~ tO the . . . . . 8 ~/ ~ ~ and chooses , at the first round of questioning , the abstract template H~'COMMUNICATED WITH SOME ANIF ~ TEBEING  . 11 . 
The first semantic aquare of this sequence formed by the model is thus :/ HEwm+_  . _ ~ oTH ~ Po ~_~/ HECOMMUNICATED WITH SOME ANIMATE BEING/  . 
The machine then asks : DOY OUMEAN

The operator chooses A , thus forming the second semantic square in the sequence :/ HECOMMUNICATED WITH SOME ANIMATE -BEING//HEHEVE AZm>-AI~T OraREE~Emr/The operator then types in the stressed word/POLICE  /   ( to specify the nature of the enemy )  , and the machine then forms the final semamtic -square:/HE~VE~mD-ALLTOTHEd/ILTOUTRE ~ELAAUXFLICS / " FLICS " having been pro-chosen by the operator's choices of template from a bilingual tree-dictionary-entry for the English word " police " with nodes as follows:

Thus the sequence of semantic ' , ~ squares formed by this operation of . the model is

HEREVE AlED-ALL TO THEENEMY 3 ILTOUTREVE LAAUXF LICS-----This square -sequence  , with its ABBCCD overlap of content , I will call the semantic deep-structure of the mode~s translation-operation  , and the tree structure given above I will call the semantic deep-structure of the dictionary-entry  . 
The totality of semantic deep-structures given by the model is the modeils ~ ot al semantic-field  . 
V_~This , stated in the briefest possible terms , is the hypothesis given by the model . No was to the pros-pect of developing this line of research  . 
The first thing to say is that the model makes clear the unsuitability of the ordinary digital computer as compared to a human being for performing translation  . 
For in this translation model the computer handles each phrasing of the input text as a separate unit  , and forces the operator , by successive rounds of questioning , so to specify it that it can be translated unambi ~aously into French  . But the human being , who does not treat each phrasing of a text as a separate unit  , but who uses his understanding of the sarlier phrasings of a text to ~ aide him in hls understanding of the later ones  , does not have to ask himself nearly so many questions  . A progressive learning-model of translation , then , is what is really required , rather than the present single-phrasing-matching model  . On the other hand , the com-plezity which has to be introduced into the model to account for all the differing French translations which have to be made of a single piece of English  , according to its context , this would have to be introduced into any effective M  . T . program : since you cannot retrieve from any computerised data-syste many data which you have not first put in  . But this second t~peof complexity can be put into the machine gradually  , by feeding in data obtained from examining the interlingual correspondenc ~ in a large corpus of bilingual text  . 
There is , however , another , muc ~ deeper obstacle to developing this research  , and that is that ( as M . T . 
research-workers have for some time past muspected  ) bilingual dictionaries provide almost no clue to semantic deep-structure  . 
Within the context of the present experiment this became apparent in examining the English word " deliberations "  . The examination began with the construction of a dictionary-entry-card of the following form : 
English : DELIBERATIONS
French : ~ OELIB ~ Pd ~ TIONS
This entry being queried ( and the maker of it having defended himself by saying that " deliberations " was the only word he knew of in English which could really be translated by the corresponding word in French  )  , it was checked with Vinay's Dictionary~1~which ~ave the entry/d~bats mp1  , discussion / . However , w ~ en an investigation whs made of how it was act ~lly ~ rans lated in the corpus of text  , it only occurred once , where it was translated " membres " , as follows:

However , this t ~ a semantic deep-structure for the hi -lingual dictlonary-entry of ~ deliberations " of the following form:  . , .  /  .   .  \ ~-  .   .   .

Present resmarch efforts are ~ herefore being concentrated on the problem of " f ~ rmingup " the whole notion of semantic dictionary-entry deep-structure  . 


In view of the great interest which has already been aroused by this experiment  , its small scale and pilot nature must be emphasized  .   ( Actual output from a trial run of the program is given in Appendix ~  )  . 
It has been implemented only on an I . C . T . 1202 computer , with T . R . A . C . facility , to which a single keyboard has been attlched , just under the print-out , on which the machine's " replies " to the operator  , as well as his " questions " appear . This machine has only 4K store with no backup , and 2K of this is occupied by the T . R . A . C . facility ; the rest of the store will therefore only hold enough Thesaurus to process an average of lO " phrasing-frames " at ~ nyone time  , so the sections of Thesaurus which are needed for any particular test have to be prechosen by hand from the larger deck of punched cards of which the Thesaurus  , in its machine-readable form , consists . Even these cards , however , are only punched as required ; the basic triple dictionary , from which the Thesaurus is being built up , is being stored on ordinary business equipment ,   ( Twinlock Handi ~ e ~ inder HRA3 handled with a Shunic Signalling System ~ Paper and a SASCO System so as to ensure maximum flexibility and ease of entry-cham ~ e  ) o Mark II of this program is to be implemented on ~ nI  . CoT . 1903 with disc-file and multiple-access T . R . A . Cofacility , but this is not expected to be operational till 1968  .

. A project supported by the U . S . National Science Foundation at the University of Bloomington  , Indiana , has just been started , to make a Thesaurus for Information Retrieval in 50 languages . 
Also a historical Thesaurus of English is being compiled on a long term basis by Professor Samuel at the University of Glasgow  ; and another , compiled by John Bromwich , is being put on magnetic tape at the Linguistics Computation Centre  , Cambridge

The properties and structure of thesauruses and/or conceptual dictionaries have never yet  , however , been mechanically examined ; partly because , until lately , machines with rapld-access-time to suffic-iently large memories were not available  , and partly because of the overall cost of such a project  .
