0 . 0 Phonolo$ical typologies ~ statistical counts and mathematical models 
The high structuring of phonology , the obvious classes of
sounds , and the classes of their classes , have made phonological
typologies a not too rare proposal . And even where typologies were
not claimed as such , they were often implicit in the statements made . 
Both phonetic and phonemic , acoustic and articulatory , structural and nonstructural , have all been proposed and have evoked discussions  , critiques and applications . 
One can mention works by the Prague linguists culminating in the writings of  , among others , Skali ~ ka , Kramsky , and no = ably Trubetzkoy and Jakobson . In America , we have work by Greenberg , Hockett , Saporta and Voegel in as well as numerous followers and critics  . Among other European contributions the acoustic typologies by Menzerath and Meyer-Eppler  . 
0 . iMathematical models and mathem at lcal ( more precisely statistical ) techniques of analysis have also been elaborated . Classification , distribution and frequency characteristics of various sound patterns have been a particular concern and represent the bulk of numerical phonological typologies  , especially in the U . S , IOften , again , the subject is classification of inventories and particular types  ( articulatory ) of phoneme S . Such is , for instance , Pierce ~ s " A Statistical Study of New World Consonants "  , with counts of from the most to the leasteo ~ on consonants and classes of consonants in a great number of Amerindian languager  , , A critique end evaluation is found in Saporta 1957  . We have probably the least structural end of the typological spectrum here  .

There is another series of phonological typologies based on Jakobson's distinctive feature analysis and of course their Praguian and particularly their Trubetzkoyan background  .  2 2 . 0 The distinctive feature indices of Andre j Avram Typological indices derived from Jakobsonian features were proposed by Andrej Avram  ( 1961 )  . to study the distribution of distinctive features in the phonological system  . 

Avram proposes the following indices ( if I understand him
P = number of phonemes
T = number of features
D = number of features with which each feature combines Dm = average distribution of distinctive features R = coverage of each feature  ( how many phonemes it characterizes ) Rm = coverage of the system as such ( : R/T ) C = complexity of a phoneme , i . e . how many features it is a bundle of Cm-average complexity of the system  ( -EC/P ) 
E = efficiency of a system ; E-P/T 2.1
Avram also includes maxima and minima for Dm , Rm , Cm . 
His typology was a good first step for studying systems via their feature distribution  . However , there are cases , such as the following two hypothetical systems , different ( but of undecided distance ) , which Avram's typology fails to distinguish .  3

Such a loss of information is characteristic of averaging  . 
3 . 0 Postovalova's valence and probabi l i ty indices More complicated yet much more adequate measures of distinctive feature distributions were proposed by the Sovietlinguist Postovalova  . 
Although they were first used for the study of Just one systems typological applications were also suggested by the author  . 
Postovalova's paper in Problemy Lingulsti~eskogo An aliza examines the subject of feature distr ibution in a phonological system  . 
Severa ~ statistics are defined : 3 . 1 3 . 2 simple probability , i . e . frequency of utilization of a feature by the system for phone mecomposition  ; the three possibilities ,  + ,  -- , 0 are considered separately . 
For feature a we have : i ! where m = number of rows with m 
Pa = ~ n = number of rows.
conditional probabilities , indicating how frequently different pairs of features characterize phonemes in the system  , which is to say , given feature a for a phoneme what are the chances that feature b will combine with a in the same phoneme  . 
Given feature ~ the probability that ~ will combine with it forth ~ same phoneme is : i ? i Pa  ( b ) = where m'-number of phonemes with a and bn ' -number of phonemes with ~  . 
3 . 3 Finally , Valence is defined by Postovalova to disclose information on a feature's combinability with the o~her features and also information on the system as a whole  ( by including total number of features )  . 
IV a ( b ) = Pa ( b - - - - ~ ) i where n = t ? tal number ? f distinct iV n -  1 features in the system . 
(The probability of a feature appearing combined with another feature would be n ~  1 if all features were equiprobable . ) 3 . 4 lllustracion from the hypothetical case of 2 . 1  ( The Valence proposed by Postovalova is modified hyAfendras  ( 1968 )  , so that it appears as foature by feature matrix : this step is very important as it makes comparison across languages a matter of comparison of features drawn from the " Universal " system  , rather than comparison between vowels and their features  . )

Clearly , the two hypothetical systems are strongly distinguished  . 
4 . 0 Valence analysis of Balkan vocalic systems And now an application of this quantitative typology to a specific problem : the Balkan linguistic convergence area  . Non-phonolog-Ica ! aspects have been thoroughly investigated  , in the classic treat-~ent by S and feld ( 1930 ) and most recently in some powerful typological 4 . 1 4 . 2 studies ( Kazazis , Civ ' jan , Birnbaum in several articles , Klagstadt , etc . ) Balkan phonology has prompted many comments by Jakobson  , Ivid and others , but to my knowledge only one systematic study ( Havr~nek ,  1933 ) which actually drew heavy criticism ( Ma~ecki Stankiewicz )  . 
Interesting results were obtained by a PP lying the above method to the  4 study of several Balkan idioms . 
But before discussing the results some of the basic problems encountered will be mentioned : The systems were compared against a maximal matrix which included all the features occurring in the population of the systems analyzed  .   5 Any of the actual systems include a subset of this maximal set of features  . In the final correlation each system was considered as having O's throughout for the features which it did not utilize  . 
But 0Ws were also indicative of impertinence of a feature for a given phoneme when the feature was distinctive for other phonemes in the system  . Thus two kinds of concepts were collapsed as they both were represented by  0  . However , this has probably been rectified by the fact that features not used in a system have a  0 throughout , Another actual handicap is the non-availability of distinctive feature descriptions for the vast majority of the systems compared  . 
And even when available , they were oftent inted by both the author's views and his preferences  ( e . g . Petrovicion Rumanian ) or were out of different periods of theoretical development of distinctive features  . 
8 4 . 3 in such cases , I took the liberty of normalizing the data by modifying the existing analyses  ( : the same method was followed throughout e . g . 
constructing branching-trees ) . In some other instances more than one solution were possible and for lack of data I kept the alternatives  . 
Such systems appear in the figures as language X - l  ,  2 , 3 etc . Other instances of numbered , multiple systems for one language refer to situations where such variety actually exists either stylistically or in social dialects  ( e . g . literary Maked on skl ) . 
Some features are very typical of vocalic systems either universally  , or for the European languages , or , more specifically , for the Balkan languages . E . G . diffuseness ,  ~  , flatness , stress ( sim Dle occurrence is considered here , no ____ ttt combinations ) . Then , other features s . a . length , to n_ . ___ ~ e , ~ etc . are much less common . An ideal comparison should give different weights to such features  . 
Sharing nasality , for instance , should be typologically very significant and two systems which do  , should be classed as very similar . Conversely , if in a group of many languages which draw on 56 features to distinguish their vowels , but usually have 3 or 4 , only one uses nasality this should be significant enough to set this particular language quite far apart  . Now , in the correlation some factors take this into account but indirectly and not sufficiently  . On the other hand since in
I reality ( i . e . in the Balkan case ) systems having " odd " features have also the " common " features  , their typological distance is reflected in their having a higher number of features than the other languages  ,  4 . 4 The introduction of a new feature usually results in a whole series of new phonemes  , and actually the more numerous these phonemes the more important the new feature to the system  . This is expressed by the product of number of distinctive features X number of phonemes = total  #of cells in the feature by phoneme matrix  . An index incorporating this will reflect more qualities of the whole system  . I propose the refor ~ tentatively samodification of the valence formula to : V ~  ( b ) = Pa ( b ) where K-#of phonemes ? ( n-i ) This weight in E makes the index much more sensitive to variations in the number of features  . 
4 . 5 Higher order conditional probabil it ies can also be introduced  , e . g . 1\]Pab ( c ) = ~ m where K = number of phonemes which have in common features a  , b and ~ , and m = number of phonemes with a and b in common . 
A Valence Vab ( c ) PaD ( c )   ( n-l ) can then be defined . 
And so on until we have the PI .   .   . ( n2) ( n-l ) and the resulting

In his case , the information was not in the form of matrices but in the farm of lists  . 
6 . 0 Results in the final plotting ( see figures I ,  2 , 3 and 4) several groupings can be discerned . 
First , in the multidimensional seal in ~ analysis , we can speak roughly of 3 groups : two form a sort of a nucleus in the center and the third  ( distributed in two subgroups also ) surrounds it . 
On the external group we have Old Church Slavic , and close by Common Slavic . Then spread around mostly Serbo-croatlan dialects  , with some other idioms ( e . g . 7-vowel Mom~ilovci Bulgarian , (9#Nasal ) vowels Barile Tosk Albanian , 8-vowel Meglenitie , 7-vowel E . Bosnia Serbo-croatian ) .

r in the Central Balkans , i . e . we have here an areal grouping . 
Four out of six Albanian systems ( all of the dialects within the geographic area of the Balkans  ) fall in one group and are closer to Macedonian and Bulgarian thanto 

Greek dialects are quite diffused but stay within the two nuclear groups  ( this includes Classical Attic and Medieval Greek . ) In the diz ~ eter method ( figure 4) , the most interesting grouping is that of all seven systems with the  5-vowel pattern ( irrespective of additional features such as length-n as a lity-tone  ) on the same side of the initial bifurcation . 
Another subgrouplng includes only systems which useflatness to distinguish a second series of hack vowels  ( Rhodope Bulgarlan , Kra ~ ova I Serbo-croatian , Bulgarian Saraka ~ an Greekp and Hrupi~ta

Among the other interesLing results are the following : contrary to Old Church Slavic and Common Slavic  , which in both analyses stand apart , Attic Greek is classed as very similar to the bulk of the systems analyzed : in the diameter method through early Joining of the branching tree  , and in the multidimensional sealing by being located in the middle of the one of the two central constellations  . This is all theme reintriguing in the light of the fact that in a similar statistical correlation  ( see figure 5 ) of some Balkan and other- , oo ~ .   .   .   .   .

1 7 systems expressed in the Harary-Paper model for binary phoneme combinations  . Attic was also in the center of the group and OCS  ( as well as Czech ) quite distant from it . Is this not a strong indication of convergence of South Slavic towards a pattern characteristic of Greek since the time of Attic ? If anythlng  , one would intuitively class the old idioms ( Common Slavic , OCS and Attic ) as belonging to roughly the same ? ype ~: large systems  , length , toner accent etc . as additional features . What " latent " structures are responsible for the outcome of the statistical analysis ?  7  . 0 Some Conc lus lons I t i s hoped that the advantages  , possible uses and problems of this approach for typological classification as wel las some uses of the latter  , were sufficiently demonstrated , It is also hoped that criticism and suggest to vs on all aspects will further the ~ ttlity and vigor of the approach  .   9 Among the main objectives is a better anchor -leg of the model on mathematical theory and  , parallel to this , better explanation of the linguistics behind the findings and in adapting the mode l  . While thl slast is obvious , the search for a model mathematic-ally we llgrounded is imperative if the approach is to profit more  i0 As a from the power of a fully developed mathematical theory  . 
concrete step in this direction , a Stochastic Process Model for the same problem is currently investigated  , as well as other models applied to different ~ speets of phonologle structure  .

Notes ( cont.)
It seems that no two " mirror " systems could be distinguished by this typology  . A theoretical shortcoming in spite of the fact that not terribly many such cases exist  . 
Much of the data analysis used for the present paper was done at the Johns Hopkins University  , as part of my doctoral research which culminated in a thesis  ( May 1968 )  . 
The idea of a maximal system thus defined can also be found in Voegelin  1963  . Uspenskij (1965:63) defines it as follows , opposite to a minimal system : " Jazyk-~talon per vogotipa  ( i . e . minimal ) mo~znop onlmat'kakteoretiko-mno~estven noje proiz vede nije % ~ sex xarakterlz\]&jemyx  ( vopredelennom aspekte ) jazykov ( modele J )  , t . e . kakin variant nuju dljavsex ~ tix jazy kov model ' ; jazy k-~talon vtorogotipa(i . e . maximal )

Uspenskij points out that the minimal system in a sense " catches the essence " of the languages to be compared  . See also the Ph . D .

Birnbaum ( 1966:20 ) in his discussion of Uspenskij above also expounds on the notions of maximal  ( : Boolean sum ) and minimal ( Boolean product ) typological systems . 
Actually , much the same is implicit in some of the American typologies  ( of course Voegelin's , mentioned above ) for instance . Pierce's , with its " omnipresent " consonants , the basic core:min lm ~ , and total collection of any conson-ants occurring in at least one language = maximum  .

Note_~s(cont .) our findings.
Grimes (1962) , for instance , analyzes phonetic diverg-ence ( :" scatter " ) within Romance and finds French and Ruman Xan display " highscatter " from expected innovations  , therefore distances from the rest . " It is tempting to guess that the scatter In Rumanian could reflect the influence of non Romance speech communities that have interacted with the Rumanian community  ( or communities )  ''  . 
Now since in our analysis Rumanian is quite close to the other Balkan languages  ( unlike , for instance Serbocroatian ) one could say that Grimes ' study and this present complement-ary and mut~lly supportlng results  . 
Edmundson's section on mathematical models In Borko  1967 prov-ides a starting point with the must and must nots of the researcher  , the does and the does nots of the model . 

In this study , the vocalic systems of a large number of Balkan idioms  ( past and present ) were analyzed in terms of Jakobsonian distinctive features  . Various methods for comparison and scaling for similarity  , as well as the problems encountered , are discussed and evaluated . Some questions of typology , such as distinctive feature weights , are revealed ; suggestions are made for their future incorporation into typologies of this nature  . 
It is a srtrprJ using fact in linguistic scholarship that no feasible  , nor adequate manner for comparing phonological systems quantitatively has been devised  . The notion of distinctive feature va lence proposed by the Russian linguist  , V . I . Postovalova , answers the need for such a feature distribut ion measure  . 
The valence matrices for the vocalic systems of flfty-one Balkan idioms  , as well as simple and joint probabilities of distinctive feature occurrence are calculated  . Finally , the results are correlated and submitted to computerized factor analysis  ( various programs )   .
