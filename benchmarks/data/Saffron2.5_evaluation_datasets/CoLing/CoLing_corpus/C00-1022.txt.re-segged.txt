2 The Terminological Resources
We use in this study a French/English bilingual terminology of the aer on autic domain  . This handcrafted at a base results tTrom a multidisciplinary effort involving technical writers  , translators , terminologists and engineers . In its current state , the database contains 12 , 267 French/English term ctmt)les , structured in 70 semantic ategories . As already ot ) served in several terminological databases , multiword terms cover the larger part ; of the database ( nearly 80%) . Tile described terms are mostly nouns but the database also contains about  200 verbs and verbal phrases . Table 1 gives some exam-pies of terms and a short description of the associated categories  . These linguistic resources are integrated in a computer-aided translation environment used by technical writers  . 
Semanticategories have originally been introduced in order to distinguish the various senses of polysemous terms  . Each term couple is annotated with one or more categorie specifying the contexts in which the translation is recommended  . An entry is associated to a tern r for each identified meaning  . For example , the french term ddpass cmerd has at least two possible meanings  , corresponding to two different translations : ovc ~ if low in the Data Processing category  ( DPR , ) and out-o\[- . /lushnc . ss in the Air-m'M't Structure category ( STR ) . As shown in the examples of table 1 , the assigmnent of semantic categories has been extended to monosemous terms  . 
In our experiments of term categorization , only the fl : enchl ; erms have 1) een used .

Our methods are ch ) set othose used for positioning unknown words in thesauri  . However , the two issues cm~bedit lhrentiated with respect to them an it  ) u-lated data . A thesaurus is intended to cover a large set ; of concet ) tual domains while a terminological database is tbc used accurately on a specific topic and its related domains  . For example , in ( Tokunaga et al ~1997) , the thesaurus to be extended contains lnore than 500 categories . This tends to make the t ) roblem harder , lint , since many categories are strictly independent , it is easier to find distinctive tieatures between categories  . By contrast , our terminological database contains only 70 categories . But , in this restricted set , we find categories corresponding to close or even overlapping knowledge areas  .

4 . 2 Train ing and Test qJhe exogeneous classifier starts with the selection of test documents in the cort  ) us . Technical terms found in these documents will form the test set  . The remaining documents represent the training corl  ) us . %' aining and test stages are the following : ? POS tagging  . The test and training corpora are tagged with Mult Ana  , a tagger designed as an extension of the Multex morphological analyzer  ( Petitpierre and Russell ,  1995) . Occurrences of the technical terms are identified during this stage and the terms to be categorized are those which are identified in the test corpus  . 
? Extraction of contextual cues . For each term occurrence in training and test data  , the contextual cues are collected . 
Only the lemmas of open-class words are used and cues may correspond to multiword terms  . Each test term is then represented by the set of cues which have been collected in test data  . 
' ~ Note that the categorization process could be simplified by eliminating P  ( wi )  , since this quantity is constaif l ; for all categories .

? Frequency calculation and probabil-ity estimation  . Training data are explored to compute the frequencies  ( occurrences and cooccurrences ) of cues , terms and categories . As mentioned earlier ( section 3) , tile cue occun'ences which have been collected around the test terms are ignored during this step  . Tile probabilities required for the categorization operation are then computed  . 
? Categorization of the test terms . The most probable categories are assigned to each test term  ( see section 4 . 1) . Figure 1 gives ; some examples of exogencous categorization 3 . 
5 Endogeneous Categorization
Our approach to endogeneous categorization is simpler  . It is exclusively based olla quantitative analysis of the lexical composition of technical terms  . Henceforth , the open-class words used to compose technical terms will be called ter-minolwical components  . The endogeneous approach relies on a much more restricted source of data than the exogeneous approach  , since the comI ) one : nt set of a terminological database is quantitatively limited compared with the set of contextual cues extracted from corpora  . Nevertheless , we make the assumption that this quantitative limitation is partly compensated by the a Some category labels are described in table  1  .

6 Experiments and Evaluation
To estimate the accuracy of the exogeueous method , we used a domain-specifi corpus of 541 , 964 words , coml ) osed of documents I ) ertain-tug to various textual genres ( softwares t ) ecifica-tions , maintenance procedures , manufacturing notices . .  . )  . This corpus covered 63 of the 70 categories . Each run starts with the selection et a document among the corpus documents  . 
The known terms identified in this document are considered as test : terms  . We used relatively wide contexts . The cues were extracted in a window of : t=20 words around the term . 
Each run involved more than 70 , 000 contexts of term occurrences . To experiment heen do-geneous apI ) roach , test sets of col~xl ) ound terms have l ) een randomly extracted from the , terlni-no logical database . 
We adopted an evaluation scheme similar to that det lned in  ( Tokunaga et al , 1997) for the-saux'us extension . The categorization is considered successful if ' the right categox ' y appears among the t ~: first categories assigned by the classifier  . Within a semiautomatic acquisition framework , this evaluation scheme is more suitable than strict evaluation where only the first category assigned by the classifier is considered as relevant  ( evaluation restricted to h = l . )' l . 
Froluoux ' application 1) erspective , it is useful to provide to the terminologista restricted set of less than  5 t ) lausible categories instead of the complete set of  70 categories without prior filtering . 
In the experiments des (: ribed in ( Tokunaga et al . , 1997) , k takes the values5 ,  10 , 20 and 30 for average ( t1 ) ertbrmance ranging from 26 . 4:% to 55 . 9% ( the choice is made among 544 categories ) . Some of their precise experiments yielded an accm ' a cy greater than  80% fox't ~ := 30  . In ore " experinmnts , we measured accuracy t brh = l to 5 . Some results are given in tables 3 and 4 . The scores are higher than those achieved in thesaurus extension  , especially with the exogeneous approach ( fi'om 52 . 75% to 97 . 61%) . We should however keel ) in mind that we deal with a difl brent kind of data  ( see section 3 )  .

We have presented in this paper two al ) proaches to term semantic ategorization that have been fully implemented and experimented on significant test sets  . The results achieved in this work demonstrate that term categorization tasks could be integrated within a senti-automatic  4Some limitations of strict evaluation are also t ) o inted out in ( r / ~ esnik and Yarowski ,  1999) .
