In tile framework of Macll Irre ( aided ) Translation systems , two types of lext cal knowledge are used , " natural " and " formal " , in the form of on-ilee term lno logl caI resources for human translators or revisors arid of coded dtctlonaries for Machine 
Translatton proper.
A new organization is presented , whlch allows to integrate both types In a un ique structure  , called " for k " integrated dictionary , or FIB , A given FIG is associated wlth one natura l language and may give access to translat ions into several other laeguages  . 
The FIGs associated to languages L1 and 1_2 contain all information necessary to geeerate coded dictionaries of M  ( a ) T systems translating from L1 Into l_2 or vice-versa . 
The skeleton of a FIG may be vlewed as a c lassical r no nollngual dictionary  , augmented with one ( or several ) bilingual dictionary . Each Item Is a treestrLictLIre , constructed by taking the " natural " info rmation  ( a tree ) and " graft 1 t\]~JII onto it some '1 form a 111 lnf " ormatIon . 
Various aspects of thls design are refined and Illustrated by detailed examples  , several scenarli for the construc II on of rids are presented  , and seine problems of organizer ion and Imp lementation are discussed  . A prototype hrlp lementation of the FID st ructure IsL  , lder way ill Grenoble .

INTRODUCTIO_N .
Integrated Machine ( aided ) lraoslat loll ( " M ( a ) r " ) systems tn cludo two types ef translator " a ids  , First , the rets a sort of traeslator " workstat lon "  , relying on a text processing system augmee to d with spectal f ~ unc ~ on s and glv lng access to one or several " natural " on-l ine " lext cal resources "  IC4  , 7\[I , such as dictionaries , terminology lists or databanks , and the saLIri . This constitutes the Machlne Alded Human Translatlon  ( " MAHT " ) aspect . Second , there may be a true Machine lranslation ( " MT " ) system , wh tell " lingware " conststs of " coded " grammars and dictionaries  , lhlsIs the ( human alded ) MT aspect , abbreviated as " HAMT " , or simply " MT " , because human revision Is necessary even more for machine translations than for humant ranslations  . 
The tern1 " coded " doesn'torly mean that MTgr ' armlar's and dictionaries are written In Specialized Languages for " Linguisti c Progran lnf rrg  ( " SLLP " )   , but also that the grammatical and lexical Information they contain is of a more " fo rmal " nature  . In some systems , the f`ormal lexical information ts are duct ion  ( and perhaps ae oversimplification ) of the Information found In usual dict ionaries  . But , tn all sophisticated systenls , it Is far more detailed , and relies on some deep analysis of the language  . Moreover , tile access keys may be different : class ic ald tct  1char les are accessed by \] efftrlas , whlle formald'lct looartes may be accessed by morphs  ( roots , affixes .   .   .  )  , \]el~\]~ras , lexlcal units , and even other linguistic properties . Ill many systems written illARIANE- -78   1   , left , as are not directly used . 
Efforts have beer \] made to devise data base systems for the natural or the formal aspect  , separately . 
Multillngual terminological databases , such as TERMIUMI'B\[I or EURODICAUTOM , Illustrate tt ~ e first type . 
Ontile other hand , the Japanese and the French National MT pro jects have developed specialized lexlcal database systems  ( " LEX DB " )   , in which the ( formal ) information is entered , and from Wlll Cll MT dictionaries are produced  . More precisely , there Isa database for " each language ( I .  )  , and for eacl \] pair of laeguages ( L1 , L2) handled by the MT system . From the first LEX DB , analysis and syntiles ls MT dictionar ies for I_are automatl cally construc ted  , while transfer dictionaries for ( L1 , L2) are produced from tire second . 
In all Integrated M(a ) r system , it would be useful to maintain the two types of d lc tionarles in a unique struc tere  , ill order to ensure coherency . rhlsstrLlcture would act as a " pivot "   , being the source of the " natural " view as well as of the " formal " dictio earles  . Moreover , ft would be lnterest lng , for the same reasons , to reduce the number of I . .E XDBs . Will \] the tocl ~ r l 1due r / lentioned above , there el '(:; I\]*'2 for ' I'1 languages . 
The authors have begun a research aloeg those I lnes in  1982   6  )   . \[ rl 1985 , this has led to a tentative ( smaI 1 -seale implementation ef a first pro to type  , adapted to tl ~ eaims of " a Eurotra coetra et . 
Attile time of revision of : tl ~ ls paper  , work on specification arrd Implenrent at ion was being continued by a smalteam try iog to construct a Japaeese-French-Er/gli shL  . EXDB , for a part lcular domain . Tills is why some details given in thi sP a Der are already obsolete  . However -, the spirit I ~ as remaleed the same . 
lhe Ii/a ~ ll Idea Of the new organization ls to fn to grate both types of dictionaries in a unlqtJestructllre  , called " for ' l ~ . " integrated dictionary , or " I:ID ' . A given FIDtS associated with one natural laeguage and may give access to translat ions Into several other languages  . 
Hence , there would be only nFiGs for n languages . Thef " or moF ~ tle " natural " Dart has been designed to reflect the organlzat  1on o ? current modern usual dlct lonerles . 
lhts is why we have limited ourselves to the " for k " architecture "  , and have not attempted to constrtlct a L lnlquestr ' ueture for n languages  . 
Intile flrst part , we present tile " skeleton " of a Filli tem  , Part I1 shows how to " graft " codes onto It , and discusses the nature and place of tll ose codes  . Finally , some problems of ' organization and fmplementation are discussed in part II i  . An annex gives a complete example for the len~r ~ as associated with the lexl calun it COMPTER  . 
I ... USINGA't NAURAL " SKELE rON
After having stedied the strectures of several classical dlct  1char les , including LOGOS , IAROUSSE , ROGER 1 , I4ARRAP'S , WEBSTER , SACHS , etc .   , we have proposed a staedard flor a for the " natural skeleton " of a FIG item  . 
Items are accessed by the lenrn as , but the eotlono fiexl caluntt (" LU " , or " UL " 111 French ) ts present . 
k , bl ~\] las are " norm a1 Forms "0? words ( in Engilsh , tn flnlti retier ' verbs , singular For " nouns , etc .  )  . A lext caluel tfs the main element of a derl vatlonal family  , and is usually denoted by the main len~na of thts family  . Lexl calunlts are useful lrl MTs ys tems  , for " paraphrasing purposes .

ALM " Vorsass " 1, 3 . T~sp ~ f element ~ n__ the enotation There are three types of elements in the examples  . 
Keywords are underlined . They show the articulation oF the standard structure  . In case of repetition at the same level , numbers are used ( e . g . trad1) . 
Identlflers are in uppercase ( and should be In italic , but for the limitations of our printer )   . They correspond to the list of abbreviat ions which is usually placed at the beginn ing of a classical dictionary  . They may contain some special signs such as "   . " or "-" Strings are shown between double quotes  . They cer respond to the data . We use our " local " transcription , based on IS0-025 ( French character set) . 
2 . FORMOFANITEM 2_ . .!~ K ~ s . ~ emmas L_lex 1 calu 0 It AAs illustrated above , an Item may consist of several lemmas , because of possible ambiguities between two canonical Forms  ( e . g . LIGHT-noun and LIGHT-adjective) . 
The corresponding LUIs always given . The symbol "--" stands for the key of the I tem  . Confusion should be avoided In the denotation of LUs  . For example , for lern mas LIGHT , we could denote the LU cerreponding to the fi rst  ( the noun ) by .   .   .   . lm1 " or .   .   .   . CIN .  " 2  . 2  . Constructions refinements m@s The preced ing Items have been chosen for their relat iveslmplt ctty  . In general , a lemma may lead to several constructions , a construction to several refinements , eacb deflQed as a " meaning " , for lackef a better word . 
Further refinements may be added , to select various translations For ag iven meanlng  . The Following diagram illustrates the idea  .

\[ntultlvely , constralnts are more local to the left than to the right  . The presence of a construction may be tested In a sentence  , but the notion of domain of discourse or of level of language Is obviously more globa l  . 
The notion of construction Is fundamental . In particular , predicative words cannot be translated in I solation  , and it Is necessary to translate express ions of the Form P  ( x , y , z ) , P being the predicate and x , y , z Its arguments , possibly with conditions on the arguments . 
Note that 1dloms or locutions are particular Forms of constructions  . 
In general , refinements may be local or global . Local refinements often consist In restr ictions on the semantic features of the arguments  ( " to count on some body " vs . " to count on something ") . Global refinements concern the ( abstract , bulletln , article , ckeck-11st .   .   .  )  . 
In our view , a meaning In L1 ls translated by one or several construct ionsIn  L2  . 
We have then avoided to translate a meaning by a meaning  , which might seem more logical . But this would have forced us to descrl be the corresponding cascade of constraints In  L2  . As a matter of fact , It Is usually possible to reconstruct It , from the constraints tn L1 and contrast lve knowledge about L1 and L2  . Hence , we follow the practice of usual dlct lonarles  . 
2~ . 3, TrAoslat lqns . C !-- t~:"fork " dictionaries We have shown how to include In an Item Its transla tions Into several target languages  . Hence the term " for k " . The " handle " Of the item consists In all information concerning the source language  ( L 1 )   . In order for such an organization to work , we must have at least 2 such dictlonarles , for L1 and L2 , as no detailed information about 1_2 ls included In the Ll-based dictionary . This information may be found In the L2-based dlct 1chary   , by looklng-up the appropriate ttem and locat lng the construction : the path from the key to the construction contains It  . 
3. F&CTORIZ_ATIONAN p_REFERENCE
AS seen In the examples , we introduce some possibllltles of naming subparts of a given len'~na  , by simply number lng them ( sees 3 refers to trad1 In " atmosph6 re " )  . 
This allows not only to Factorize some info rmation  , such as translations , but also to defer certain parts of the i tem  . For example , translations might be grouped at tile endo f the  ( linear ) writing of an item . The same can be said of the formal parto ? the Information  ( see below )   . 
I_I ~_GRA . I = TIN_ . O " . _EO_BMAL . . I NFOI~MAT ~ ON ? I ' CODE_S " . 1= . _PRIN CIPLES_l , J .   .   . _ALL rl~utQ~_~n~clAsses The formalized info rmation may correspond to several dlst lnc t\]ln  . qulst lc theories . Such a theory Is deflned by a set o ? formal a ttr ! butes  , each of a well-defined type . 
For example , the morphosyntact lcclass might be defined as a scalar attrlbute : CATMS  ( VERB , NOUN , ADJECTIVE , ADVERB , CONJUNCTION , etc .   ) The gender might be defined as a set attr ibute : GENOER = ens  ( MASCULIN , FEMINTN , NEUTRE ) . 
Each theory may gl verise to several imp lementations  ( \] tngwares )   , each of them having a particular notation For representlng these attributes and the i r values  . 
Moreover , lr , a given llngware , the information relatlve to an Item may be distributed among several components  , such as analysis , transfer and synthesis dictionaries . 
Usually , comblnat Ions of particular properties ( or " attrl bute/value pairs ) are glven names and called c jasses , _For example , In ARIANE-78 , there are the " morphologlcai " and " syntact ic " " formats "  , abbreviated as FTM and FTS , in the AM ( morphologl caI analysis ) dietlonarles . Special questionnaires , called " indexing charts " , lead to the approprlate class , by asking global questions ( vs . one particular question for each possib leat trlbute  )   .

The keyword a PD means " appended ".
In a Aless simple case , there might be two theories , called and B , of French . Suppose that the rets an analyzer , FR1 , and a synthesizer , FRA , corresponding to A , and two analyzers and a synthesizer ( FR2 , FR3 , FRB ) , relative to B . The grafted part will be of the form : ap_QtJqAlnfopropertiesIn theoryAc#d ~ LS  FR1 AMFrM CMO01 FTS CS023 code LCFRA .   .   . ( LS for source language ,   ( LC for target language ) tl !

" AM " must be Known as a elntroduct or ofcedes for morphological anaiysls in  ARlANE-78-based llngwares . 
Formal parts may be attached at all levels of an item  , for factorizatlon purposes . The Information lssupposed to be cumulated a long a path from a key to a " meaning " or to at ranslation  . If two bits of information are contrad ictory  , the most recent one ( rlghtmost In our diagrams ) has preeminence . 
Taking again the example of systems written In  ARIANE-78  , we may suggest to distribute the codes In the following fash lon  . One could attach : - the morphological codes  ( FTM ) and the " morphs " to the roots ( " bases " ) or to the lenin/as ; -the " local " syntaxo-semantic codes ( FTS ) to t be \] erml as or to the constructions ; -the " global " syntactic codes ( concerning the typology ) to the various levels of refinement ; -the codes concerning the derivations to the d~E1v parts , wherever they appear In the item .

3 . CONSTRUCTIONOFINIEGRATEDDICTIONARIES Suppose the natural skeleton of anltemts obtained by using available dictionaries  . There are two main methods for constructing the a ~ p parts  . 
First , one may begin by filling the lnfop arts . This I stiletecll nl que followed by the two afore-mentioned national projects  . For this , people without special background in computer linguistics laay be used  . They fill questionnaires ( on paper or on screen ) asking questions directly related to the formal attributes  . Thts information ls checked and insertedIn the infoparts at the propel " places  , which are determined by knowing the relation between the " natural " Information and the " theory "  . 
In a second stage , programs knowing the relation between the theory and a particular ltngware will f ill the ?  . g departs . 
The second method stries to make better use of existing MT dictionaries  . First , the relation between the elements of al lngware and the " natural " system is def in ed  , and programs are constructed to extract the useful Information from the MT dictionar ies and to distribute It at the appropria teplaces  . Then , knowing the relation between the " coded " In formation and the theory  , tn fg parts may be constructed or completed . 
At the time this paper was revised , M . DYMETMAN was Implementing such a program to construct a FID from our current Russ fan -French MT system  . Hls results and conclusions should be the theme of a forthcoming paper  . 
Inconsistencies may be detected at variouss tage shqt be construction of a Fib  , and the underiylng DB ( database ) system must provl defacilities for const ructing checks  , using them to locate incorrect parts , and modifying the item . 
Ill . PROBLEMS OF DESIGN ANDIMPLEMENTATION The const ruction of an Implemented " mock-up " has led us to identify some problems tn the design  , to wonder whether there is any available DBM S  ( database management system ) adequate for our purposes , and to ask what should be done about the representation of characters  , In a multt1ingual setting . 
I_I\]E-\[=ATION . B_ETWEE_N_NATURAL ,_ . AND FOR MA (- INF0 RMA ! . IO_N The relation between the formal info rmation of a theory and the formal informat ion of an implemented model of It  ( all ngware ) Is simple : the latter Is a notational var iant of  ( a subset of ) the former . 
By contrast , it ls not so easy to define and use the rela tion between a formal theory and the " natural " information  . The theory mlg ht ignore some aspects , such as phonology , or etymology , wi ) lleit would use " semantic " categories ( such as COUNTABLE , TOOL , HUMAN , PERSONNIFIABLE , CONCRETE , ABSTRACT . .  .   ) far more detailed than the " natural " ones ( SOMEBODY , SOMETHING .   .   .  )  . 
In order for the construction of such FID to be possible  , we must at least ask that all " selective " lnformatlon  , which guides the choice of a meaning and of a translation  , must In some sense be co~a onto the natural and the formal systems  . 
Hence , these systems must flare a certain degree of homogeneity  . Dictionaries containing very lltt leg ral ~ att ca \] Information  ( e . g . only the class ) cannot be used as skeletons For FIDs integrat ing the lexlcal database of a  ( lext cally ) sophisticated MT system . 
Another problem is just how to express there latlon between the systems  , In such a way that it Is possible : to reconstruct  ( part of ) the skeletonofant tem from the " coded " in formation  ; to compute ( part of ) the formal information on a path of the ske let on  . 
For the time being , we can write ad hoc programs to perform these tasks  , for a particular pair of systems , but we have no satisfactory way to " decla re " the relation and to automatically generate programs from it  . 
2. TYPEOFUNDERLYING DATA-BASE SYSTEM
P . Vauquols ( as on of B . Vauquols ) and D . Bachuthave implemented the above-mentioned mock -up in Prolog-CRISS  , a dialect of Prolog which provides fac1 lltles fortile manipulation of " banks " of clauses  . It Is possible to represent directly the t ree structure of an item by a  ( complex ) term , making it easy to program the functions assoc iated to a FID directly In Protog  . 
t to wever , Prolog Isnota DBM S , and , at least with tile current Implement at ions of Prolog  , a largescale implementation Would be very experlstve to use  ( in terms of t1 me and space )   , or perhaps even impossible to realize . 
ASF Ibs would certainly grow to at least 50000 items ( perhaps to 200000 or more )   , it might be preferable to implement them In a colm ~ erclally available DBMS system  , such as DL1 , SOCRATE , etc . A numeric simulation made by E . degoussineau shows that a ( 1 - -2  ) Fig of about 100000 len~mas CoUld be Implemented In a Socrate DB , of the network type , in one or two " virtual spaces " . No experlment has yet been conducted to eva luate the fieasiblllty o ? tile method and its COSt  . 
Other possibilities include relational and specialized DBMS systems  . In a relational DBMS , each Socrate entity would gl verise to are latlon  . Specla \] lzed DBMS have been developed for terminological databanks  , such as fERMIUM or EURODICAUTOM . There is a general tool for building te rminological DB  , ALEXIS (3~ . 
3. CHARACTERSETS
None of tile above--mentioned systems prov ides fa cllltles for handling mult lll ngua \] character sets  . 
Hence , all strings representing units of the considered natural languages  , including the keys , must be represented by appropriate transcrip tions  . 
Thls is clumsy for languages written In the Roman alphabet  , and almost unacceptable for oilier languages  , alphabetical or ideograph lc . Supposing that bit-map terminals and prin ters are available  , two solutions may been visaged : define appropriate ASCII or EBCDIC transcript ions  , and equip the DBM Swltll corresponding in terfaces  ; several ( possibly large ) character sets . Thlsls what has been done in Japan , where progral rmleglang Llages , text processing systems and operating sys tems have been adapted to the  16-bt tJIS ( or
JES ) standard.

We have presented and illustrated the new concept of Fig  , or Fork Integrated Dictionary , To our knowledge , this ts the first attempt to unify c lassical and MT dictionaries  . However , only a small mock-up has been implemented , and some problems of design and Implement at l  ( in have been detected . It remalns to be seen wllether largescale FlOs can be constructed and used in an operat ional setting  . 

We are grateful to AOI ( French Agence del ' Informatlque ) and to the EC ( European Co , ~nunity , EUROTRA project ) to have given US the opportunity to start this research and to test some of our ideas  .
