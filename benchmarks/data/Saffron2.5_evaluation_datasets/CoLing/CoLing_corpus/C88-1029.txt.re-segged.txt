This paper describe some of the problems that arise from the synthesis of personal pronouns in a system tlrat generates texts in Romance languages  . It puts the emphasis first on the fact that fire morphological level has to be taken hire account early in the generation process  , second on the numerous " cross dependency " phenomena which are to b  , ; found when the synthesis of an element X depends upon that of another element Y and when the synthesis of " Y depends upon that of X  . The linguistic examples are taken from French and Italian languages  , for wl fich a robust generatior t system has been implemented  . 
1 Introduction
It is generally believed that a generation system can be modularized into a sequence of components  , the first one making the " high level " decisions  ( i . e . the conceptual decisions ) , the following ones making the linguistic decisions  ( e . g . lexical and syntactic onstruction choices ) , the penultimate , one performing the " low level " operations ( i . e . the syntactic operations ) , and the last one handling the morphological operations  . We have shown in ( L . 
DanIos1985 , 1987a ) that the conceptual and linguistic decisions are operations that depend on each other  . 
Therefore , we designed a generation system modularized in the following way : a " strategicomponent " makes the conceptual and linguistic decisions simultaneously and gives back " clause templates " which are synthesized into clauses by a " syntactic omponent "  . A simplified version of the clause template syntax is the following one  ( a more complete version is presented in ( L . Danlos 1987b ) ) : \[ Cll = ( : el\[subject\]\[verb\]cpltn ( 0<_n~2 ) ) \[ subject \] :: ( : subjectoken ) \[verb \] = ( : verb verb ) cplt=\[dir-object\]/I/t-object\]/\[de -object\]/[prgp-object\]\[dir-object\]=  ( : dir-object token ) \[h-object \] = ( : h-objec token ) \[ de-object \] = ( : de-object token ) \[pr6p-object \] = ( : pr6p-object\[pr6p\] ( : objectoken ) ) \[ prgp \] = ( : pr6p preposition ) The prepositional complements JR-object \] and\[ de-object \] are complements respectively introduced by ~  , and de in French , a and di in Italian . They are separated from the prepositional complements\[prgp-object \] introduced by other prepositions because they have a specific syntactic behaviour  , especially in regard to pronominalization ( cf . 
3) . An example of a clause template is : CC1 ( : subject HUM 1 )   ( : verbam are )   ( : dir-object
HUM2)) with
HUM1=: PERSON HUM2=: PERSON
NAME : Idgo NAME : Maria
SEX:mastSEX : fern
According to the context ( i . e . fire clause templates that have been previously synthesized  )  , the syntactic component , which handles pronominalization , produces one of the following Italian clauses ( given that the verb is in the presentense )  :
Ugoama Maria ( Ugoloves Mary )
U gol'ama ( U go loves her)
Quest'uomol'ama ( Thisman loves her)
A maque stadonna ( Heloves this woman )
It will be shown in 3 that pronominalization involves the morphological level  . Tire decisions concerning pronominalization , which is a stumbling block for natural language processing  , must certainly not be made last . 
Thus , the morphological level ( level supposedly very " low " ) must not be taken into account only at the very last stage of the generation process  . 
The second aim of this paper is to put forward " nonlocal dependencies " which are to be found when the synthesis of an element X depends upon that of another element Y  . 
Such a dependency requires the synthesis of X to be carried out after that of Y  , whatever the order of X and Y in the clause template  . Moreover , cases of " cross dependencies " are to be found when the synthesis of X depends upon that of Y and when the synthesis of Y depends upon that of X  . A cross dependency leads to conflicting orderings  , namely synthesis of X after that of Y and synthesis of Y after that of X  . The solution to such conflicting orderings is to perform a sequence of incomplete syntheses of X and Y  . 
2 Nonlocal and cross dependencies
The syalthesis of the verb and direct object in French will be taken as an illustration of non local and cross dependencies  . On file onelland , the synthesis of the verb depends upon that of the \[ dir-object \] for two reasons  . 
First , there is a switch from the auxiliary avoir to the auxiliary dtre  ( when the verb is conjugated in a compound tense ) if the \[ dir-object \] is synthesized as a reflexive pronoun  ( which must appear before the verb )  :
U go add test d Marie ( Ugohated Mary)
Ugos ' estd ~ test d(Ugo hated himself)
Second , there is agreement in gender and number between the past participle of a verb conjugated in a compound tense and a\[dir  . .object \] synthesized as a personal pronoun ( which must appear before the verb ) : Ugo , jel ' aiddtest ~( IJ go , I hated him ) Marie , jel'aiddtest Je(Mary , I hated her ) Ontire other hand , the synthesis of the \[ dir-object \] depends upon that of the verb in the following way which will be explained in detail in  3 : determining whether the \[ dir-object \] has to be synthesized as a personal pronoun may depend upon the first letter and the form of the conjugated verb  . All in all , the synthesis of the verb depends upon that of the \[ dir-objeet \] and the synthesis of the \[ dir-objeet \] depends upon that of the verb  . This cross dependency can be handled with the following sequence of incomplete syntheses :  1  ) Determine if the \[ dir-object \] must be synthesized as a reflexive pronoun  ( by checking if its value is equal to the value of the subject  )  . If it is , mark the verb as having to be conjugamd with the auxiliary ~ tre  . 
2) Synthesize the verb ( i . e . conjugate it ) without taking participle and a pronominalized \[ dir-object \]  . In Step 2 , the verb is conjugated in a compound tense with the right auxiliary thanks to Step  1  . Let us mention that the conjugation of a verb is a morphological operation  . 
3 ) Synthesize the\[dir-object \] if it has not been synthesized as a reflexive pronoun in Step  1  . In Step 3 , the form of the conjugated verb provided by Step 2 is used to determine if the \[ dir-object \] has to be synthesized as a personal pronoun  . 
4 ) Complete the synthesis of the verb if necessary , i . e . 
carry out the agreement in gender and number between a past participle if any  ( information given by Step 2 ) and a pronominalized\[dir-object \] if any ( infomation given by
Step 3).
These four steps imply that both the direct object and the verb are checked over twice  . Note that this is only for the synthesis of these two elements  . The cross dependencies that arise from other elements imply that the direct object and the verb are checked over more than t twice  . Generally speaking , a clause template ( i . e . a tree ) is gone through several times in the syntactic omponent  . 
3 Synthesis of personal pronouns
If a token refers to the speaker ( s ) or the hearer ( s )  , it must be synthesized as a first or second person pronoun  ; the only operation to be performed is the computation of this " dialogue " pronoun  . Otherwise , we consider synthesizing a token as a flfird person pronoun only if it has already been synthesized  ( because occuring in a previous clause template , for example ) . In other words , we do not consider the left pronominalization phenomena  ( T . Reinhart 1983) . 
Determining whether a token which does not refer to the speaker  ( s ) or hearer ( s ) and which has already been synthesized has to be synthesized as a personal pronoun requires the following steps to begone through :  1  ) Compute the form of the fore seen pronoun ( eL3 . 1) ;  2 ) Compute the list L1 of tokens that have been synthesized in nominal phrases whose " morphological " features  ( i . e . gender and number ) are compatible with the form of the foreseen pronoun  ( eL3 . 2) . 
3 ) Compute the sublist L2 of L1 that contains only the elements of L2 that are syntactically compatible with the for eseen pronoun  . For example , in Mary hated her , Mary and the personal pronoun her cannot be coreferential  . The token representing Mary is said to be syntactically incompatible with the pronoun her  . 
4 ) Compute the sublist L3 of L2 that contains only the elements of L2 that are semantically compatible with the for eseen pronoun  . For example , in The book is on the table , it was published recently , the pronoun it and the table cannot be coreferential because the direct object of the verb publish in the active  ( its subject in the passive ) cannot be a piece of furniture . The token representing the table is said to be semantically incompatible with the pronoun it  . 
5) According to the number of elements in L3 , and may be according to other considerations , decide actually if the fore seen pronoun has to be synthesized  . At a rough estimate , if the number of elements of L3 is one , then the fore seen pronoun can be synthesized since it does not lead to ambiguity  , while it should not be synthesized if the number of elements in  L3 is greater than one since it would lead to ambiguity  . Yet , it is wellknown that pragmatic and structure parallelism considerations may allow a pronoun to be nonambiguous even if  L3 has more than one element ( G . Hirst 1981, C . Sidner 1981, K . 
McKeown 1985, L . Danlos 1987a ) . Step 5 takes those considerations into account to determine whether the fore seen pronoun has to be actually synthesized  . 
3 . 1 Computation of the form of the foreseen pronoun This computation ivolves the following factors :   1  ) The syntactic position in which the token that could be synthesized as a pronoun appears  . In English , it is enough to distinguish between the subject and complement positions  . In French and Italian , it is necessary to distinguish between the\[ subject \]  , [ dir-objeet\] , \[ h-object \] , \[ de-object \] , [lee-object\]and\[prdp-object\]positions : the\[subject\]and\[prdp-object\]positions generally give rise to pronouns that are similar to the English ones l  ; the other positions may give rise to pronouns that must appear before the verb  , such pronouns being noted Ppv . 
2) The person and number of the token . Person and number are semantic information which are given in the definition of the token  . 
3 ) The gender of the nominal phrase that synthesizes the previous occurrence of the token  . In French and Italian languages , which have only the masculine and feminine gender  , gender is not semantic but lexieal information . 
Consider the token TOK1 with the following definition :
TOK1=:BICY CLE
NUMBER : 1
DEFINITE:yes
In French , it can be synthesized as a feminine noun group la bicyclette  ( the bicycle ) or as a masculine noun group lev dlo ( the bike )  . The gender of a pronoun which synthesizes a token is generally equal to the gender of the previous occurrence of the token : Labicyclet test cass de  . ( Elle +* ll ) estaugarage . 
( The bicycle is broken . It is at the garage . ) Lev ~ loest cass ~ . (11+* Elle ) eat augarage . 
( The bike is broken . It is at the garage . ) 4 ) The human nature of the token along with the verb  ( in the infinitive form ) of the clause template . As an example , consider the synthesis of an \[ h-object \] in Italian  . The verbs d are , pens are and credere can all take a human or non human\[h-object \]  . The form of a pronoun corresponding to the \[ h -object \] of one of these three verbs is given in the table below  2  :
TABLE ,, 1~m:sHUMANf-s,-iid a reglile . plur . loe I credere Igli Ilelor epens a relalui I aleial or o 
NONHUMAN gli'leio rociciciciciIn Italian as well as in French  , the form of an \[ h-object \] pronoun can only be obtained by consulting a " lexicon-grammar "  ( M . Gross 1975, 1986; A . Ella et ali 1981) . 
1In fact , an Italian\[subject\]pronouniserased when this erasing does not create any ambiguity  . There is no room in this paper to discuss this complex phenomenon which is also to be found in Spanish and Portuguese  . 
2 The abbreviation " ms " stands for masculine -singular  , " fs " for feminine-singular , " plur " for plural . The pronouns preceeded by the preposition a are not placed before the verb  . 

For each w, . : cb , a lexicon-granamar records all its syntactic properties  , among them those concerning pronominalization . 
5) The synthesis of the verb . /n French , a\[dir-objeet\]of the third person singular is pronominalized as leif the previous oc ~  ; urrence of the token is masculine , a slaiffeminine : Ugo , je\[evo is souvent(Ugo , Isee him often ) Marie , jelavo is souvent ( Mary , I see her often ) However , if the first letter of tile conjugated verb is a vowel  , there is elision of leoula in to l':Ugo , jel ' aivuet jel'entends(Ugo , Isawhim and Ihearhim ) Marie , je Paivue et jel'entends(Mary , Isawher and Ihearher ) This elisi ( m changes the computation of the morphological antecedents of the pronoun as shown in  3  . 2 . Therefore , it has to be taken into account when determining if the\[dir-objeet\]has to be pronominalized  . 
6) The synthesis of other complements . This factor i i wolves several nonlocal dependencies  . For example , in French , an \[ b-object \] cannot be pronominalized as the Ppv=:lui if there is a\[dir-objeet\] synthesized aste  ( M . 
Gross 1968):
Marie , jelapr ~ senter aid Ugo --> Jelalui pr ~venter ai  ( Mary , I will introduce her to Ugo -> I will introduce her to him  ) Toi , jeteprd senter ai?t Ugo -->* Jet el uipr ~senter ai  ( You , I will introduce you to Ugo-->I will introduce you to him  ) Another exmnple in Italian : an \ [ h-object \] of the third person singular can be pronominalized asgli if the previous occurrence of the token is masculine  , as leiffeminine ( see Table 1) . However , if there is a \[ dir-object \] synthesized as the P pv = :  1o   , the pronouns glior leam algamate with this Ppv and both become glie : Diedi illibroa Maria --> Ledied iil ii bro  ( I gave the book to Mary --> I gave the book to her  ) Diediil libroa Ugo --> Glldie diil libro ( i gave the book to Ugo --> I gave the book to him  ) I 1 li bro , ladiedia ( Maria + Ugo ) - -> Glielo die di ( The book , I gave it to ( Mary + Ugo ) --> I gave it to her/him )  3 . 2 Computat ion of the morpho log ica l antecedents of the foreseen pronoun A token  , which does not refer to the speaker ( s ) or hearer ( s )  , eoll respends to a morphological antecedent of the for e seen pronoun if it has been previously synthesized as a nominal phrase whose morphological features  ( i . e . 
gender and number ) are compatible with the form of the foreseen prunoun  . For example , if the fore seen pronoun is the French\[dir -objet\]pronounla  , its morphological antecedents are the feminine singular noun phrases  ; the Italian \ [/ i object \] pronoung li , its morphological antecedents are the masculine singular noun phrases  ; tile Italian \ [ h-object \] pronoun le , its morphological antecedents are the feminine singular noun phrases  ; the Italian \ [ h-object \] pronoung lie ( result of an amalgamatio ~ l of glior le with another Ppv  )  , its morphologie ~ antee e . xlents are the singular noun phrases . 
In the cases mentionned above , the computation of the morphological antccedent ~ of the fore seen pronoun  ( i . e . 
the eomput ~ ition of the list L1 ) only depends upon i the form of the pronoun . The computation of L1 can also depend upon the synthesis of other elements  , thereby involving nonlocal dependencies . For example , when the fore seen pronoun is l ' , its morphological antecedents are all tlle singular noun phrases if the conjugated verb does not include a past participle as in Jel ' entends  ( I hear him/her/it )  ; otherwise , its morphological antecedents are the singular noun phrases with the gender indicated by the past participle : in Jel ' aivu  ( I saw him/it )  , the morphological ntecedents of 1" are the masculine singular noun phrases , while in Jel ' airue(Isa wher/it ) , the morphological antecedents of l ' are the feminine singular noun phrases  . This is why the synthesis of the \[ dir-objeet\] depends upon that of the verb  . It is an illustration of the claim that pronominalization ivolves the morphological level  . 
Conclusion
The cross dependencies and morphological interactions wl fieh were presented here concern only the synthesis of personal pronouns  , putting aside the synthesis of sential , subordinate and coordinated clauses . The reader can guess the complexity of a syntactic component for Romance languages  . A robust French and Italian syntactic component has been implemented in a procedural Common-Lisp rogram  . An English syntactic component has been implemented in a declarative formalism using functional descriptions  ( J . M . Laneel et ali 1988) .
