1 Introduction
The interlingual approach to MT has been repeatedly advocated by researchers original ly interested Jn natural language understand ing who take machine translation to be one possible application  . However , not only the ambiguity but also the vagueness which every natural language inevitably has leads this approach into essential difficu lties  . In contrast , our project , the Mu-project , adopts the transfer approach as the basic f ramework of MT  . This paper describes the detailed construction of the transfer phase of our system from Japanese to English  , and gives some examples of problems which seem difficult to treat in the interlJngual approach  . 
The basic design principles of the transfer phase of our system have already been mentioned in  ( i )   ( 2 )  . 
Some of the principles which are relevant to the topic of this paper are :  ( a ) Multiple Layer of Grammars ( b ) Multiple Layer Presentation ( c ) Lexicon Driven Processing ( d ) Form-Oriented Dictionary Description This paper a l so shows how these principles are realized in the current system  . 
2 The Construction of the Transfer Phase The t ransfer phase of our system consists of the following three sub-phases  ( Fig . i ) . 
Pre-Transfer Phase ( Pre-TP )
Main Transfer Phase ( MTP)
Pcst-Transfer Phase ( Post-TP ) f-re-Transfer p . ha .  :  , l-~Main Transfer Phase ~ P:st-Transfer : has J Fig  . I . Construction of the Transfer Phase Analysis results ' of input sentences of the source language  ( SL ) are represented in the form of annotated tree structures  , from which one can retrieve various levels of information contained in the input sentences  . The MTP is performed recursively from the top of the tree to the bottom  ( Fig .  2) . At each step of the recursion , the sub-structure governed by a node ( current node , node Xira Fig .  2 ) is transferr ( ~ d to the corresponding structure of the target language  ( TL )  . This phase mainly performs lexJ caltran ~' fer , that is , it chooses an appropriate target lexical item for node X by examining the annotation parts of that node and its dependent nodes  ( nodes YI ,  . .Y2, . .Yn ) . The selection of a target lexical item may place certain constrains on the transfer of the dependent nodes  . These constrains are expressed as property-va lue pairs and added to the annotation parts of the dependent nodes  , which are to be utilized in the subsequent recursion steps  . For language pairs such as Japanese and English which belong to quite different language families  , however , the lexical transfer is not so straight forward  . It often happens that single lexical items of SL correspond to complex  ( -~ x pressions of TL and vice versa . Furthermore , certain structural changes are also required . 
Because the MTP recursively transfers substructures governed by single nodes  , certain global structural differences cannot be naturally treated  . Such global changes are dealt with by the Pre-TP and Pest-TP sub-phases  ( See section 7 )   .

Fig .  3 . For a-orlented Dictionary for Nouns ( Di-lingual Dictinary ) of Nouns The following four columns are provided in the form-oriented bilingual dict ionary of nouns  ( Fig .  3) . The description of each column is expanded in to corresponding types of lexical rule  ( i . e . GRADE rules which are stored in the dict ionaries and invoked at specified processing phases : GRADE is the programming language for wr iting grammar rules used in our project  )  . 
(1  ) Column A : Transfer based on the Relations h ip to the Governor  ( Fig .  4 ) Even major parts-of-speech such as nouns need not correspond between two languages  . Certain Japanese nouns correspond to words of different parts-of-speech in Engli sh  , depending on the surrounding context .

Same postpositional case particles shou ld be translated into different preposi tions  , even though the deep semantic relationships in Japanese are the same  ( thai : is , Japanese native speakers cannot intuitive ly distinguish the difference  . ) In Ex-4 , for example , English native speakers can clearly dist inguish the semantic relationship of ' results ' and ' effects ~  ( GOAL or OBJECT case ) from that of ' family ' and ' duty ' ( BENEFICIARY case )  , whereas in Japanese the same postpositional case particles are used and so the distinct ion of the semantic relationships is not so clear for Japanese natives  . We cannot , therefore , even expect the stability of semantic relat ionships across the two languages  .

Fig .  5 . Example of descriptions in Column-B ( 3 ) Column D : Transfer based on Collocations wi th 
Predicates ( Fig . 6)
Certain combinations of nouns and predicates ( verbs , adjectives , etc . ) in Japanese are t rans la ted into s ing le words in Eng l i sh : the combinat ions are lexical ized by single English words  , combinations of nouns and adjectives , for example , are often \] . exicalized by single English adjectives . 
Ex-5 .  ~ ~ ~  .   .   .   . > lustrous(luster ) ( to exist ) ~ g ~ ~ . . . . > ef f i c ient ( efficiency )   ( to be high ) These combinations can appear in the position of an embedded clause and cause structural changes between two languages  ( Fig . 7) . Combinations of verbs and their case elements may also correspond to single English verbs  . 
Ex-6 .  ~ ,~ % ~  .   .   .   .   . > focus ( focus )   ( to adjust ) It also happens that Japanese verbs with wide ranges of meaning should be translated into certain English verbs when collocated with specific nouns  . Rules which choose appropriate English verbs by referring to semantic class : ifications of case elements  ( nouns ) are defJned as \] . exical rules in the verb dictionary ( See Section 4 )  . However , certain collocations of verbs and nouns are so specific that choices of appropriate target verbs cannot be expressed by the lexica \ ] rules of verbs of this type  . column D in the form-oriented dictionary of nouns is used to specify such collocations between nouns and verbs  . 
Ex-7 . I h ~ l l ~ % 1 ~ b W ~ .   .   .   .   .   .   . > leave a space ( space )   ( ?? ) The description of this column is not only expanded into \] exica \] rules of the nouns but also into the property  ( J-DIC-DER : V ) of those nouns . The values of this property is a set of Japanese predicates which require special t reatments when they are collocated with the nouns  . When node Xill Fig . 2 is a predicate , the rules in the main grammar check whether there exists a dependent node whose property J -DIC-D\]'\]RIV contains the predicate  , and if such a node exists , they invokes the lexical rules of the corresponding nouns  . 
In the dependency structures produced by the Japanese analysis grammar  , simple modification of nouns by adject ives such as  Ex-8  . ~i  ~ J .   .   .   .   .   . > heavy rain ( to be strong , ( rain ) to be big , to be heavy , etc . ) are a l so represented as embedded c lauses ( Fig .  8) , and so column D is used to choose adjectives in English  . Note that most of the combinations between nouns and appropriate adjectives are highly conventionalized in each language and so it is hard to imagine the conceptual primitives for adjectives that could be language independent  .

Modifiers
We have several words of minor parts-of- speech in Japanese which roughly correspond to determiners  , quantifiers , etc . Jn English . Almost the same kind of information as column D is specified in this column for these words  . 
4 The Form-Or iented Dict ionary and Lexical Transfer of Verbs When the node X in Fig  . 2 is a verb or an adjective , the transfer grammar for predicates is invoked . If it dose not exist : , the other rule in the grammar invokes the lexica l rules derived from the form-oriented dict ionary of the predicate  ( node X )  . By examining the annotation parts of that node and its dependents  , the lexJ cal rules of a predicate may determine ( \] ) the trans\] . a tion equivalent in English ( 2 ) the deep case relationship and surface ease maker of those dependents strictly governed by the predicate  . 
If a Japanese predicate is really ambiguous , a separate case frame is provided for each of its meanings  . The Japanese analysis grammar disambiguates the meaning and a separate lexical entry is prepared in the bilingual dictionary  , i . e . different meanings of a predicate are treated as different lexica \]  , items translation is not caused by ~ mbigui ty such as this but by vagueness of meaning  . When we treat a language pair such as Japanese and English  , it is not exceptional but rather usual that a verb of SL has to be translated into diffe rent target lexical items  , even though the native speakers of SL cannot clearly realize the meaning difference  . 
Ex-8 . ~ ~ Jz  ~ .   .   .   . > ~ the performance ( performance ) 9~~_L ~ .   .   .   . > increase the speed ( speed ) ~ K~i ~ ~\] zCf ~ . . . . > raise the water surface ( water surface ) The above three usages of the verb '~' are cont inuous in the sense that all of them have the core meaning in common  . If we considered them as different meanings , the Japanese verb '~' would have plenty of d ifferent meanings and be a highly ambiguous word  . Note that the English verb ' to wear ' should be translated into more than five differ n t Japanese verbs depending on what is to be worn  . ' To wear shoes ' , ' to wear a watch ' , ' to wearspectacles ' , etc . should all be translated differently . These facts show that it is impossible to establ is h the set of lexical items of the interl ingua  . In our system , then , these ' translationally ambiguous ' lexicali tems are treated in the transfer phase  . 
The form-oriented dictionary of verbs is shown in Fig  .  9 . Each pair of condition and a transform at ion is expanded into a tree transformation rule of GRADE  .

The substructure governed by the node Xist ransferred recursively by an appropriate subgrammar  , depending on the properties of that node . For simplicity , only the subgrammars for main clauses and noun phrases are shown in detail  . The blocks surrounded by bold lines in this figure are those which are performed by lex ical rules described in section  3 and 4  . The lexical rules are invoked at the beginn ing of the subgrammars  , because they are the rules for treating id io syncratic phenomen a specific to lexical i tems and are applied before the other  , more general rules are applied . Constraints on some of the dependent nodes such as syntactic forms  ( a prepositional phrase with a specific preposition  , etc . ) are determined by these lexical rules , and added to their annotation parts . These constraints are utilized at the next recursion step where the substructure under each dependent node is

That is , general rules are applied to the dependent nodes of a predicate  , only when the node W i in Fig . i0 is not treated by ( i ) lexical ru\] . es from the column D of the node Wj ( 2 ) lexical rules of the predicate , the node X ( 3 ) lexica \] rules from the column A of the node W i ( 4 ) lexical rules from the column C of the node W i The general rules are further divided into the following two categories :  ( i ) Rules in the case when the deep case relation between the node W i and the governor  ( the node X ) is uniquely determined by the analysis g rammar : They determine the surface preposit ion of English by referring to the deep case interpretation  , the surface case marker of Japanese , and the lexica \] item and the semantic markers attached to the node W  . 
1  ( 5 5 semantic markers are used in our system to classify Japanese nouns  )   . 
(2 ) Rules in the case when the deep case relation is not uniquely determined in the analysis phase : They determine the preposition just by re ferring to the surface case marker of Japanese  . The preposition roughly corresponding t : O the Japanese surface case marker is selected  . 
The above two categories of rules are just roughc\]assificat\[ons and  , in reality , more detailed rules are prepared for each Japanese case marker  . In particular , there are several type 2 rules for each surface case marker which take into account the set of possible case in terp retations given by the analysis phase  . 
Thus , tl ~ e dependent nodes of a predicate are transferred by several kinds of rules with dif fering preferences in order to utilize as much of the in\[ormat Jon extracted during the ansiys is phase as possible  . The same multiple layer construction of subgrammars is a \]  . so adopted for the other grammatical units such as subordinate clauses  , embedded clauses , etc .

The form-oriented dictionaries are provided just for preparing dictionary descriptions for a large number of ordinary lexica \] J terns  . The forms given in the preceding sections are used by lexicographers who do not have any detai led knowledge about the transfer grammar  . At execution time , these descriptions are expanded into GRADE lexica \] rules  ( Fig . ll ) . 
If one wants to specify complicated transfer rules which cannot be expressed in these fo rm s  , one can provide \] exica \] rules direct ly in GRADE  , and attach them to specific lexica \] , items . Such lexica \] rules are also invoked at the appropriate time during that ransfer phase  .

The transfer rules are highly specific to each lexica \] item  , and therefore , we do not prepare any dictionary formats for these words  . 
The tranfer rules are directly prepared in the GRADE form  . The adverbial postpositional particles in Ja parlese  , for examp\] . e , are translated into adverbs , prepositions , sty\] . es of sentences , etc . , depending on each \] exica \] item and its surrounding context  .

The correspondence of these expressions is highly dependent on language pairs and so should be treated in the transfer phase  . 
7 The Structural Transfer
The MTP transfers Japanese structures into corresponding English structures recurs ive \] y by traversing the Sapanese analysi strees  ( dependerlcy trees ) from the top tet be bottom . The order of processing is ) re-determined by the dependency trees given by the analysis phase  . If the substructures are changed unexpectedly dur Lng the recursion  , the upper \] eve\]of recursive processing cannot respond to the change  ; if it could , tee rules which c beck the results of the transfer of the substructures and take appropr iate actions would need ko be provided  , making the construction of subgrammars unnecessarily complicated  . 

There are pairs of stereotypibal sentence sty\]es Jn the two languages which cannot be translated by phrase-to-phrase trans\ ]ation  . 
translate dirl to an adverb or a preposJtion a\] phrase in EnglJsh  . Rules are prepared in Pre-TP , which transform clausal constructions in to phrasal constructions  . 
Ex-11AtZW$~a~12 t~<,B_~ .   .   .   . 8 ~6 ---> not only his ~ but also B is " o " Because the clues of such stereotypical sentence pat terns are embedded deeply in the analysis t rees  ( see Fig . 14 ) and resultant tree structures of the transfer phase become quite different from those of the analysis phase  , it is difficult for the recursive processing in MTP to treat them  . 
The two phases , Pre-TP and Post-TP , are provided for such global structural changes . In these two phases , each rule traverses the whole tree independently in order to find where the rule is applicable  . 
8 Pre-Transfer Phase
In this phase , certain structures in Japanese which do not have direct English equivalents are trans formed into more English-oriented structures  . 
For example , the following structural transformation ( Fig . 12) is taken place , because Japanese quantifiers such as ~ b ~ ( many , much ) , ~ f~b ~ ( few , little ) etc . can be used as predicates but English quanti fiers cannot  . 
Ex-12 X2~;~b .   .   .   .   .   .   .  > :~<~ ) X h ~ l ~ Y - ? ~ xo ( many )   ( many )   ( to exist )

Furthermore , the following structures in Japanese are treated  . 
( i ) Subordinate clauses which should be expressed by adverbs or prepositional phrases in English : 
Ex-13 ( to pay attention to )   ( machine )   ( to control )   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   . > to control ( the ) machine carefully A subordinate clause with a predicate of ' TE'-form  ( ~ , \[~7\[-to pay attention to ) is usually expressed in Englls has a subordinate clause with a conjunction such as ' while '  , ' when'etc . or a participle clause . 
However , when the predicate of the subordinate clause is a verb of a certain type  , the clause expresses the ' manner ' case of the main clause and it should be Such structura l transformations are often required in the t ranslation of Japanese into English  . Some complex expressions which contain subordinate clauses or embedded clauses are used in Japanese only for expressing deep case relationships  .

\]0 Conclusions
We explained ~ n this abstract the construct ion of the transfer phase of our Japanese-Eng\ ] i  . sh translation system . The implementations of the whole system has already been completed and the trans\]atJon results  ( i0 , 000 sentences ) are now being evaluated by professional trans lators and native speakers of Eng\]ish  . '\]' he evaluation results obtained by now are quite satisfactory  . 
The description in the form-oriented dict ionaries discussed in this abstract are currently prepared for a bou  74  , 000 nouns and 5 , 000 verbs and adjectives .
