REFERENTIALNETSWITHATTRIBUTES
Christopher U . Habel *
ODe of the essential problems in natural language production and understanding is the problem of processing referential relations  . In this paper I describe a model for representing and processing referential relations : referential nets with attributes  . Both processes ( analyzing and generating referential expressions ) are controlled by attributes . There are two types of attributes , on one hand , the ones to the internal substitutes of the objects spoken about  , on the other hand , the ones to the descriptions of these objects . 
I . BASICNOTIONS : KNOWLEDGE ANDSEMANTIC REPRESENTATION It is a wellknown fact that  ( computational ) models of human language production and understanding have to take the knowledge of the speaker and the listener into consideration  . Thus , one of the main problems is to describe and represent this knowledge and to distinguish relevant subtypes  . A suitable classification which I described in detail in Habel  \[7\] distinguishes three subtypes :- knowledge of facts or assertions  , e . g . of states of the world , events , etc . , the " factual knowledge ' , -knowledge of rules , e . g . of rule-like relations between objects or states of the world  ( or classes of such entities )  , the " inferential knowledge ' , -knowledge of objects , e . g . of persons in the world , the " referential knowledge ' . 
(In this paper I give emphasis to the third type : referential knowledge represented by " ReferentialNets '  )  . 
The common core for representing all these types of knowledge is the " semantic representation language " SRL  . From the formal point of view SRL is a ( propositional ) symbolic language as described by Kalish /Montague  \[8\]  . Wellformed SRL-expressions are generated by normal  ( recursive ) formation rules . I distinguish-as usual-two kinds of meaningful expressions in SRL  , terms and formulas . Thus we define :
TER - the set of wellformed terms
FOR - the set of wellformed formulas
SRL = < FOR , TER >
For the purpose of knowledge representation SRL contains some specific operators  , e . g . 
on the factual level : tenses , beliefs , ......
on the inferential level : entailment relation , ...
on the referential level : description operators of various types  . 
Since SRL is a representation language , I now have to treat the central question of " representation theory ': What kinds of entities are represented by the different entities of SRL ? Here I follow-with minor changes  , which I will not discuss in this paper Miller\[ I0\]: The expressions and entities of SRL represent cognitive concepts  . The operators correspond to different types of " concepts " in the Miller-approach  , e . g . predicative , nominal and modifying concepts ( this third class are the " operators " of Miller . ) . E . go by means of description operators it is possible to construct nominal concepts from predicative concepts or other nominal concepts  . 
I shall now illustrate SRL with an example . In understanding and representing the sentence ( i ) I will meet Barbara in the university tomorrow . 
the act of referring to " I " , " Barbara " , and " the university " is to be processed , i . e . the ( obJect- ) orientation to them is the interesting problem from the referential point of view  . The SRL representation of ( i ) is ( 2 ) time ( meeting ( l , Barbara , ETA(x ): university(x )) , tomorrow ) The arguments of " time " and " meeting " present the most relevant types of referential operators : " I " and " tomorrow " are deictic substitutes  ( personal or temporal )  , Barbara is a proper name and the expression " ETA ( x ) : university ( x ) " is built up from the nominal concept "' university "  ( representing a class of institutions for education and science  ) and the variable-binding description operator " ET a '  . " ETA ( x ) : p ( x ) " has the meaning "' an element from the class x /p  ( x ) >" . ETA is an indefinite analogy to the IOTA-operator of formal logics  ( Similar operators are introduced by Hilbertas EPSILON - or ETA-operator  . ) . The semantics of the description operators is given by a set of inference and evaluation rules  . E . g . there is an inference rule which relates the ETA -expressions to expressions with existential quantification :  ( 3 ) p ( ETA ( x ) : q ( x )   ) ~EXx : p ( x ) & q ( x )   1" Some evaluation rules will be described in the following chapters  , e . g . " creation of a referential object ' .   ( Both types of rules are described in detail in Habel  \[5\]  ,  \[6\] . ) Thus , ETA is the formal representative of one of the meanings of indefinite articles  . 
Further descriptions of the objects mentioned in ( i ) or in the SRL expression ( 2 ) can be generated by ( focussing ) transformations similar to the solution of algebraic equations : The university mentioned above is also the one described by  ( 4 ) ETA ( x ) : time ( meeting ( l , Barbara , university(x )) , tomorrow ) 2 ~ or the natural language equivalent " a ( the ) university where Barbara and I will meet tomorrow  "  .   ( The uniqueness of the ETA-description depends on the sltuat lonal/textual context  . ) Before we pass on to a detailed description of " referential nets '  , I will make a short remark on discourse and communication  . As mentioned above human language production and understanding is based on the speaker-listener's knowledge of the language  , the world and particularly the participants in the communication  . Thus , I assume a discourse model 3* which is based Dntripartite knowledge ( namely factual , inferential , and referential ) , each of these types is represented by structured sets of SRL-expressions  . 
\2. THEREFERENTIALNET
Processing , e . g . storing or retrieving , referential relations is executed by a particular component of the discourse processing system  , the " referential procedures " ( ReP) . The RePs work on a memory structure which is adequate for the representation of knowledge about objects  , the " referential net "( RefN ) 4* . ARefN consists of entities of three different types : - referential objects  ( RefOs )  , which are the internal substitutes for the objects spoken about  , -descriptions , i . e . terms of SRL which describe the RefOs , -attributes , i . e . properties of the description-relation between a RefO and one of its descriptions or properties of the RefO  ( see chap .  3) . 
After detecting a new indefinite description ( as ETA ( x ) : unlversity ( x ) ) ReP creates a new " referential object '" ( Ref O )  . During the discours 6 ( after the identification process ) further descriptions of the same RefO will be linked to this RefO  .   ( The relation among the descriptions of the same RefO is the wellknown relation of e o reference  , ) ~ us we have , for example , the following set of descriptions of the RefO mentioned above:  ( 5 ) r . l  ~ . ~ d . II--ETA(x ): university(x ) d . 12--ETA ( x ) : time ( meeting ( l ' Barbara ' university ( x ) )'t?m?rr?w ) d . I3--IOTA(x ): professor-at ( Barbara , university(x))
REFERENTIALNETS WITH ATTRIBUTF_~103
For the description of the referential netIuse SRL and in addition a " finite but extendable " set  , REFO , of " referential objects ' . The referential objects are seen as a kind of basic term of SRL  . The set REFO is analogous to the set of variables  . The phrase " finite but extendable " is used to emphasize the dynamic aspect of the set REFO and the RefN  . REFO consists of exactly those RefOs that are actually needed  . It is necessary to distinguish two types of terms  , one type which consists of the mental representatives  , i . e . the RefOs , and the other which contains those terms which function as descriptions  . Naming this set by D-TER we have TER-REFOUD -TER  . Thus , referential nets , RefNs , can he defined as ( 6 ) Ref NcD-TER x REFO ? For < d-ter , r . i > 6 RefNI also use " d-ter deserr . i '", " d-ter is a description of r . i " . In this way a description-relation is defined on the basis of the RefN  . 
By means of referential nets it is possible , e . g . to arrive at one object ( i . e . 
RefO ) via different aspects , i . e . different descriptions , of this object . It is only by such aspects ( cp . Schank's\[II\]way of memory discrimination ) , that a system is able to choose "' a best description " of the objects which are the theme of the discourse  ( see below )  . The referential net ( 5 ) is simplified in two crucial points , first , that the descriptions of r . loperate on MSRL~pressions and not on RefOs , too . But this can be treated similarly to the focussing process of  ( 4 )  , which can be formallzed now : (7) p(r . i ) 8---r . i--ETA(x ): p(x ) Using (7) , the descriptions can be solved with respect to all RefOs  , i . e . all arguments are filled by RefOsor open terms  . Thus we can derive (8) from (5): (8) r . l~-----d . II-ETA(x ): university(x ) d . 12-ETA(x ): time ( meeting ( r . 2, r . 3, unlverslty(x )), r . 4) d . 13-IOTA(x ): professor-at(r . 3, universlty(x )) r . 2--d . 21-"I'"r . 3--d . 31 -- Barbarar . 4--d . 41 -" tomorrow " Secondly , RePhast O explicate the referential links of deict lc substitutes  , e . g . 
" r " refers to the speaker , etc . . " " stands for the specif ic ReP which evaluates deictlc expressions  , i . e . which in s ~ antiates deictic ~ x pressions with RefOs  , e . g . 
" I ' "- SPEAKER(l ) ( c p . f n 6 . ) . By the same methods newRefOs for " we " can be created  , e . g . in the processing of " There we will discuss some papers  . "( We =
Barbara+I ) 3 . ATTRIBUTESIN REFERENTIALNETSI will now extend the basic two-place relation between RefOs and descriptions to the more adequate concept of a many-place referential relation  . The additional places will be called " attributes '  . In the first step of extention I give emphasis to " attributes of descriptions '  . They represent properties of the description relation  , i . e . of pairs < d,r > ER efN . Thus , the extention to an attributed RefN ( ARefN ) uses a set ATT of attributes and changes ( 6 ) to ( 9 ) ARef NcATTxD-TER x REFO . 
For < att , d , r > CARefNI also say "' att is an attribute of d with regard to r "  . 
Some possible attributes are ( Note the fact that this list is not complete and not fully adequate  ) :-syntactic and semantic features of the description  , e . g . gender , number , sexus , etc . 
-numerical values , e . g . " grades of relevance of a description " , " degrees of " being the TOPIC/being in the FOCUS ""  , " recency " .   5* A simple strategy for de-/coding is : ' ~ se/try the description or RefO with highest degrees !'" -names of persons  , e . g . participants of earlier discourses . By this attribute it is possible to find a description relevant to speaker and listener  ( C p . Clark/Marshall's\[I\]co-presence triples) . 
-situations in which the description/RefOIs relevant or was introduced  ( cp . 
Webber's\[12\]"evoke?-predicate).
-links to the factual knowledge ; thus we can answer such questions as " What will
Barbaradotomorrow?"104 CH.U.HABEL
Before I explain the concept of " attributes to descriptions " by some examples  , I will new sketch some aspects of function and statue of the attributes  . Firstly , in both processes , analysis as well as generation of referential expressions  , it is necessary to take into consideration a set of alternatives  . All of them are possible candidates to be the referent  ( in analyzing ) or to be a good description ( in producing ) respectively . The goal of the ReP is to choose exactly one from the alternatives  , namely " the best ' . It is obvious that trying to choose the best can fail  . Then the decision has to be revised afterwards . ( But this is a total different problem . ) In other words , the function of the attributes is to point to the most appropriate  ( or being more careful : to that which seems to be the most appropriate  ) of the alternatives . Secondly , I think that , on one hand , knowing and processing attributes is part of human natural language processing  , and therefore , these attributes have to be part of the discourse processing model  . On the other hand , knowledge of attributes is different ( cp . the list of possible attributes , above ) from the factual or referential knowledge . Thus , I propose a strict separation between descriptions and their attributes  . This strict distinction contrasts to Webber's \[12\] solution : her use of the " evoke '- predieate mixes the concepts of descriptions and their attributes in a cognitive inadequate manner  . 
Now I shall continue with examples of the use of attributes ? Let us suppose a situation in which a questioner Qasks :  ( I0 ) Where can I study Computational Linguistics ? and the answerer A knows that the university which is  ( internally ) represented by r . l is a good university to study CL . The selection of the best description of r . l depends on Q and A ( and the situational context )  . I assume the following attributes to the descriptions of r  . l(from (5) , (8)): ( ii ) descr , general relevant to : time of relevance :- d . ll " unspecified "- d . 12 SPEAKER(I ), LISTENER(1), BarbaraNEIGHBOR(r . 4) 6*-d . 13 SPEAKER (1) , LISTENER(I ) , KNOW ( Barbara ) always ( II ) describes a situation , in which the name/location of the university in question is not represented  , e . g . since the information about the possibility to study CL was given by an earlier utterance of Barbara " We have some courses in CL " but A  ( whose RefN is represented by ( ii ) ) does not know where Barbara teaches . The best description can be chosen by comparing the attributes of Q with those of the descriptions of r  . l . If Qknows Barbara, . i . e . < KNOW(Barbara ) > ATT(Q ) 7* , then the best description will be : (12) d . 13 -" The university where Barbarateaches ( as a professor )  . " Ranking d . 13 higher/better than d . 12 depends on the dimension " time of relevance ' . Furthermore , if Qk nows more about r . lit is possible that Q will react with , (13) " Well , at Amherst . '" and now A is able to extend hls/her RefN with a further description of r  . l(14) r . l-d . 1 4 -Amherst --" general high relevance "" always  "   ( This attribute depends on the fact that proper names have high relevance in general  . ) Anagously we can use attributes in the decoding process  . Look at the following pair of sentences ( similar to ( I ) ) . 
(15) a . I will meet the head of the linguistic department tomorrow  . 
b . She is a specialist for Montague grammar.
To solve this referential problem ( and not to be puzzled by the pronoun " she " ) we need further background knowledge , e . g . " Barbara is the head of the linguistic department  . " . With this prior knowledge and the additional ( theoretical ) concept of " attributes to RefOs " 8* as described in ( 16 ) "female " " local TOPIC'-r . 3--d . 31-Barbarad . 32-IOTA(x ): head-of(x , linguist . dept . ) the referential problem of ( 15 ) is easy to solve . A system ( human listener or machine ) has to match the pattern corresponding to the pronoun " she " ~ I ch is induced by the context  ( 15 . 5) against the descriptions , their attributes and the attributes of the RefO ' s  . The crucial attribute is here " female " for both " she " and " r  . 3" . 
This type of congruence between gender of the pronoun and sexus of the RefO  , i . e . 
REFERENTIALNETSWITHATTRIBUTES 105 between attributes of descriptions and those of the RefOs  , is very important in German . In spite of the syntaet l cineon gruence ( neutr . vs . fem . ) it is possible ( in colloquial German ) to say: ( 17 ) Ich trafgesterne in Maedchen . Slehatterote Haare . 
Imet yesterday aglrl . She had red hair.

4. CONCLUDING REMARKS
By means of an extended referential net ( w~th attributes both of descriptions and RefOs ) it is possible to describe how to store and process referential entities  ( and expressions ) in a cognitive adequate and powerful way . 
Following the principles and concepts described above a system for anaphora resolution has been implemented  ( Guenther\[3\] )  , which will be a component of the next version of the BACON-system  ( cp . fn3) . 
FOOTNOTES : * Parts of the first draft of this paper were prepared during my work with the project " Automatic Construction of Semantic Nets " at the Technical University of Berlin  . My current research on " referential nets " has been supported by the DFG  ( German Research Foundation )  . Author's address : Blel btreustr . 36 a , D-1000

I * From a formal point of view " inference rules " are transformation rules on SRL  . 
Their cognitive and philosphl cal status , which is analogous to Miller's\[ I0\] " conceptual entailment ' , is described in a be \] ,  \[7\] . 
Here , i , e . in (3) , and in the focussing rule ( 7 ) " p " stands for all types of concepts which are represented by open formulas  . 
2* The focussing transformation mentioned above is based on the concept of referential nets and therefore its description will be postponed to the following chapter  . In (4) a special " bar-convention " is used , which I do not want to explain in detail here . In case a term is necessary as argument , e . g . 
of " meeting " , the " bar " will change the open formula " p ( x ) '" to an " open term "3* Cp . abel\[7\] and Gust/Hahel/Rollinger\[4\] . This model is the theoretical basis of the natural language QAS BACON  ( Berlin Automatic COnstruction of semantic Nets )  , developed at the Technical University of Berlin , which was supported by a grant from the Federal Government since  1978  . It should not be confused with the BACON-system of Carnegie Mellon University  ( we chose the same name at the same time )  . 
4* The concept of referential nets is similar to discourse referents  ( Karttunen\[9\] )  , reference diaries ( Clark/Marshall\[1\] ) and discourse models ( Webber\[12\] )  . The most relevant difference between referential nets and the other approaches and the main advantage of referential nets consist in the further attributes described below  . 
Note the fact that the acrony=s ReP , RefN , etc . can stand for the respective concept , e . g . " referential net ' , as well as for a specific instantlation , e . g . 
the RefN (5) or (8) . Furthermore ReP concerns the system of referential procedures as well as the individual procedures  . In all these cases the meaning of the acronym is obvious through context  . 
5* In this paper TOPIC / FOCUS are used in an informal and intuitive way  .   ( For a detailed investigation of these concepts cp  , Grosz .  \ [2 \ ]  ) Note that the attribute " time of relevance " i : ~   ( ii ) is part of TOPIC/FOCUS . 
106 CH . U . HABEL6* SPEAKER ( l ) stands for " the speaker of utterance ( I )  '  , i . e . this attribute gives more information than Webber ' s  \[12\] " evoke ( l ) ' . " KNOW (_) " represents " people knowing _' . "NEIGHBOR ( -- ) " stands for " points/periods of time near to the point of time being the argument '  . I do not want to explain the underlying " logic of time " here  . 
7* I wil l not explain the concept of " attributes of a person/participant " here  . 
I use it in a straightforward and intuitive manner . 
8* The extention to attributes of RefOs is analogous to that from  ( 6 ) to ( 9 ) : AAR ef NcATT . IxD-TER x(RED OxATT . 2) ? ATT . I stands for the attributes of descriptions , ATT . 2 for the attributes/properties of RefOs . AAR efN is a " double attributed RefN' . Note the fact that same of the attributes of the RefOs will be computed from those of descriptions ~ e  . g . "female " from a attribute of " Barbara ' .
