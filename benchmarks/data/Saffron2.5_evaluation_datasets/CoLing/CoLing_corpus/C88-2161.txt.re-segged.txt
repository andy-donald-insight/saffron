This approach has been developed in the context of the EUROTRA machine translation  ( MT ) project and thus has been designed with respect to a syntaxbased stratific at ional translation process ? We assume that in a semantic representation determiners are deleted and that their semantic function which is represented by semantic features is percolated into the mother node  . The semantic functions of determiners are explicated  . The interaction between grammatical and lexical quantifieatiun is outlined  . Ensemble theory is applied to the " count "/" mass " noun distinction  . Transfer of quantification between German , English , and French is illustrated with respect to the " count " / " mass " distinction  . The article closes with an outlook on \[ he relevance of generalized quantifiers for Machine 

1 . Semantic representation of determiners in EUROTRA EUROTRA aims at defining a semantic representation which guarantees simple transfer between all European languages  , that is , it should be " eur oversal " . The concept of " euroversality " implies , amongst others , a semantic representation i a canonical form out or " which all European languages may be generated  . 
With respect oth is canonical formit is reasonable to delete the determiners during translation into the semantic representation and to represent heir meaning by semantic features of the NP  . 
This step may be motivated primarily by two facts :   ( 1 ) Languages vary with respect to the use of 0-determiners  . 
(2 ) The set properties realized by an entity are expresse differently in different languages  . 
Timidea that determiners are not deep structure constituents  , but that their surface structure constituents have to be generated from a semantic representation is not new  . It can already be found for example in PERLMUTTER  1970  . Moreover , to represent he quantifier by means of semantic features of the NP implies that the entity which is focussed by the process of determination cannot be referred to directly  , but only as the argument of the determiner which provides a new referent  ( cf . 
PINKAL 1986) . BARWISE&COOPER ( 1981 ) consider determiners as two-place predicates which take the noun which is the domain of quantification as one argument  , and the rest of the sentence , which is the predicate quantified as the other argument  . With respect to the EUROTRAMT system this has important implications for the translation between the syntactic dependency level-the EUROTRA Relational Structure  ( ERS ) and the semantic level-the interface St ructure  ( IS )  . 
Determiners which have the function of modifying nouns at ERS on the basis of several syntactic conditions establish different types of determination  . Those types of determination are the ba , ; is for deducing ( i . e . translating ) exactly that information which yields the new referent in the NP by unifying with the semantic features of the noun  . 
Although both determiners and quantifiers have characteristic functions  , they have others in common , so that a borderline is difficult to draw . Cases of cross classification exist in many languages  , as for example the one constituted by German der / ein/O  , French le/un/O , English the/a/O ( cf . VATER 1963) . This is why we describe both determiners and quantifiers by a common set of semantic features  . 
2. The semantic functions
It is agreed in the literature that determiners and quantifiers share the function of DELIMITATION  ( cf . VATER 1980) . This delimitation consists in the localisation of a referent in the speech or textual context or the non-linguistic situation or in relation to the presupposed knowledge of the hearer or reader  ( only the first of these functions , and this again in a rather restricted way , may be represented in the EUROTRA system ) . 
BARWISE&COOPER ( 1981 ) refer to this function of delimitation as the property " lives on " and define that determiners " assign to common count noun denotations  ( i . e . sets ) A a quantifier that lives on A . "(BARWISE&COOPER 1981 . 179) 2 . 1 . Quantification over whole sets : " generic " versus " identifying " It is the function of determiners and quantifiers to quantify overgets of entities  . The writer's motivation to create sets is that the entities which should be members of the set share one or several properties  . Following the tradition of the MONTAGUE approach  , BARWISE&COOPER treat all NPs as quantifiers which denote sets of properties of individuals  . There are two basic types of WHOLESETS , which may be created . 
( l ) The entity's extension is created " generically " by means of it's inherent lexical meaning as in the following example : Die Linguistens ind in formalen Sprachenge iibt  ( Linguists are practised informal languages . ) . 

Here the NP quantifies exactly over the complete set of linguists of the actual world  . 
An lntensional property of the entity set makes possible it's " identification "  . In this case a WItOLESET is referred to which is precisely delimited  ( cf . VATI ?; R1963, PLATTEAU 1980) . This type of entity set may only be established context-sensitive  . It is thus a set which may be referred to as a WHOLESET only with respect to a certain domain of interpretation  , which is the intensional property :
The linguists of EUROTRA ...
This NP quantifies exactly over that set of linguists who work for EUROTRA  ,  2 . 2 . The semantic functions of determiners : determiners as variables and as variable-binding fnnctions It is the function of determiners to select one or several entities from a set of entities  ( cf . PLATTEAU 1980) . 
The salient function of indefinite determiners is equivalent o that of the existential quant if ier  ( cf . LANGENDONCK 1980 , PLATTEAU 1980) ; they introduce new entities into the speech or text situation  . Thus they only express that entities exist in the speech situation  , without " specifying " which . It is an infinite set of a potential of ent it i es  ( cf . HAWKINS 1978 . 198) . We may therefore say that indefinite determiners in their salient function are variables  . This yields a PARTIALSET of entities which is " existential "  . 
Beside this salient function the indefinite determiner may also " specify " entities  , if it is clear in the universe of discourse which entity is designated  ( ef . OOMEN 1977 and DIEUGENIO 1986) . 

The salient function of definite determiners i that the existence of an  . entity is already presupposed by the writer , i . e . the writer presupposes that the entity is already given  , that the reader is already acquainted with it ( cf . OOMEN 1977) . Now the variable which is presupposed to have been assigned to the entity  ( entities ) by the indefinite determiner is bound : We need another linguist for EUROTRA-D  . The linguist should be a specialist in s . vntax . 
The definite article thus yields a WHOLESET of entities which is precisely limited by a fixed reference point  , that is it is " identified " . 
2.3. Classifiers
A special case of indefiniteness may be said to be what LANGENDONCK calls " in definiteness with asserted partition " in opposition to " ordinary asserted partition "  . We said above that it is the function of determination to select an entity or entities out of a set  . We can also say that they partition a set into those entities which are members of a subset and those which are not  . 
With " ordinary asserted partition " expressed by an indefinite determiner and a noun this partitioned set is an infinite set of a potential of individuals  . " Indefinites with asserted partition " are classifier constructions  . They constitute the clearest instance of exclus ivenessor partitioning  , in particular partitive constructions with the semantic structure  \[3x   1  ( xl_cx  ~ ) \] . 
( cf . LANGENDONCK 1980 . 213) . Exactly the same holds for this structure that holds for the relation between definite and indef inite determination : A potential subset of entities is presupposed  , when a specific part of those is asserted : this part of the article  . . . 
Beside the feature " partitive " the features " sortal "  , " collective " , " mensurar ' , " scale " , and " nnmerative " become relevant in the realization of this structure  . 
3. Determination of the set properties
The fact that the set to be quantified is greater than one is expressed by different surface structures in the European languages  . With proper " count '' z nouns plurality may be designated by the plural morpheme  ( the determiners )  . With " discontinuous " " mass " nouns classifiers may be used in order to partition the mass into amounts and thus make the partioned masses  ( not the mass on its own ! ) countable ( several pieces of advice , different boxes of vegetables ) . Finally , a " collective " refers to a set which is greater than one  ( the furniture )   . In German the individuation of certain " abstract " mass " entities may simply be achieved by the plural morpheme  . The use of the German plural is only impossible with nouns which designate " continuous "" masses "  . 
3 . 1 . The interaction of lexical and grammatical quantification A noun designates an entity the inherent set forming properties of which a relex icalized  . By means of grammatical quantification this entity may form different sets  . On the one hand there are entities , the inherent set forming properties of which may not be influenced grammatically  , but which may only designate on their own . This is the case with " continuous " " mass " nouns  ; we may also say that they designate sets absolutely  . On the other hand there are entities which are not able to form sets on their own  . This holds for " discontinuous " " mass " entities  ; they may also be considered as designating sets by a variable with respect otheir lexical potential  , this variable only being filled by a constant by grammatical context  . From a logical point of view this idea ' is developed more precisely and more over integrated into a coherent system in BUNT  1979 and 1985  . In the following we will apply this system to language  . 
" Continuous " ensembles ( of . BUNT ) are true " masses " which may not be enumerated that is they may not be designated by a plural expression  . They satisfy QUINES cumulative reference condition  . The cumulative reference of mass nouns implies that the union of any two masses W is again W  . Orvice versa the distributive reference condition means that any part of some mass W must again be W  . If we refer to " continuous " ensembles , we do not imagine any smallest part of the ensemble which may not be divided any more without the ensemble ceasing to be what it was  . A prototypical " continuous " ensemble is that referred to by the " mass " noun time  . The following syntactic condition holds : ( 1 ) All nonpluralizable " mass " nouns are " continuous "  . 
This means that the property of continuity is lexical  . Examples of nouns referring to " continuous .   .   .   . mass " entities are participation , impetus , increase , adhesion , int portanee , x tent . 
Contrary to the mode of reference to " continuous " masses is that to " discontinuous " ensembles or sets  . While the feature " discontinuous " is lexical , its subspecifications are only realized in interaction with grammatical structure : " Atomic " sets or ensembles cannot be imagined to have any genuine  ( = nonempty ) parts , that is ( 2 ) All " count " and " discontinuous " " mass " entities designated by singular nouns are " atomic "  . 
"Atomic " sets or ensembles may , however , be merged into " discrete " sets or ensembles which are constituted either by " individual " count " entities or by entities which are basically " mass "  , but which may be turned into an ensemble which we conceive of as having genuine parts e  . g by being represented by several amounts . This is expressed by pluralization or by preceding classifiers  , as e . g . with advice , which gets enumerable by the " numerative " piece  . This is not possible with " continuous " mass entities  , as e . g . those designated by the nouns importance , research . 
Moreover , " collectives " are " discrete " . Now we can summarize : ( 3 ) The designation of " discreteness " is yie lded by pluralized " count " and " mass " nouns as well as by " collective " nouns  ( cf . ALLAN 1976 . 99 , where he defines the result of collectivizing as the unmarked  ( singular ) form of plural reference )  . 
4. Transfer of quantified noun phrases
We start from our condition developed in the previous chapter that pluralizability is represented by the lexical features " discontinuous " and " continuous "  . Singular NPs then have to be translated into three semantically different NPs at IS :  ( 1 ) Into an " atomic " NP if and only if a " count " or " mass " noun for which " complexity " does notequal " collective "  , and for which " distribution " equals " discontinuous "  . 
(2 ) Into a " continuous " NP if and only if a " continuous " " mass " noun is generated  . 
(3) Into a " discrete " NP then and only then , if a " collective " noun is generated . 
The source IS-representation of an atomic NP wi ll be transferred into the identical target IS -representation with the exclusion of the features " mass " and " count "  . which may change as in the translation from le conseil in it's " individual " reading to English the advice  , as illustrated in figure 2 .

A " continuous " NP may change into a " discontinuous " " atomic " or " discrete " NP  , as in the translation from der Ratin to the advice  , as represented in figure 2 .

NPs referring to " discrete " mass " entities may either change into a " discrete " NP constituted of " individual " entities  , as in the translation from the furniture to die MiJbels tiJcke or they may be transferred into the same target-language representation by translating into die MiJbel  . The translations are represented in figure 3 .   14oth representations will effect the generation of a plural NP in German synthesis  .

In the case of numeral quantification the German noun must be DISCONTINUOUS  ; in this ease unification succeeds with Ratschlag  , which is " count'r , " individual " , " discontinuous " , that is " atomic " in the case of a one-element set and " discrete " in the ease of a set that has more than one element  . Whereas the latter case is the unmarked case in which the default rule  ( 4 . 1) applies , the former case is the marked one which is represented in figure  4  .

The unmarked transfer is achieved by our default rule  ( 4 . 1) . The marked case is that the lexical value of the target language disagrees with the source language one  , so that for the latter case we have rules (4 . 4) and (4 . 5) .

In semfeat = distribution = discentinuous Moreover by the given transfer rules translations between the following representations will be guaranteed :  ( 1 ) Les meubles which is lexically either " count " and  . 
" individual " , and hence " discontinuous " , or " mass " and " collective " , that is , it is also " discontinuous " in this second reading  . On the basis of their morphosyntactic behaviour both readings yielda " discrete " NP  ( 2 ) The translation from French into English yields two identical translations  , as only one lexical unit with the " collective " reading exists in English : the furniture which is lexically " mass "  , " collective " , and hence yields a " discrete " NP , so that in the case of being quantified the quantifier is again followed by piece  . One of the identical readings has to be killed . 
(3) If we translate from French into German , the NP with the " individual " noun is translated into die MO belsti~cke  , which has the same features , both in the NP and in then . The French NP with the " collective " n is translated into die MO bel  , which also has the same features , both for NP and n . In the case of a preceding cardinal number phrase the German noun MO belstiick with a morpheme as " numerative " must be generated  . The German noun in this case is " count " , " individual " , " discontinuous " , that is " atomic " in the case of a one-element set and " discrete " in the case of a set which has ? more than one element  . 
4.1. Conclusion
It was the intention of this chapter to point out how two types of semantic features with lexical and grammatical origin which quantify the noun phrase interact in transfer : From the dictionaries we generate those semantic features quantifying the set of entities which refer to the constitution of the entity  ( " count "/" mass " , " individual "/" coltective "/" partitive "/" sortal "  , " eontinuous " /" discontinuous ") , while in the unmarked ease the set forming properties are transferred from source to target language representation by a default rule  ( " discrete " / " atomie " )  . More precisely , an " atomic " set alays goes to an " atomic " set  , a " discrete " set normally goes to a " discrete " set  , it may , however , go to a " continuous " set , if a continuous entity is generated from the dictionary as in the case of the correspondence b tween les conseils and derRat/the advice  . In the same way a " continuous " set normally goes to a " continuous " set  , it may , however , go to a " discontinuous " et as in the opposite translation from derRat to the advice  . 
5 . Generalized quantlflers in Machine Translations Let us close with an evaluation of the super /subset relationship holding for generalized quantifiers and its relevance for machine translation  . Indeed , we are convinced , that the properties of persistency , monotonieity , strength and weakness , conservativity and others which BARWISE&COOPER ( 1981 ) and others have introduced are relevant with respect to the disambigation of representation f the NP  . BARWISE&COOPER themselves mention the ambiguity of a few  , which is monotonously increasing ( men1 ) in its positive reading ( at least a few ) and not monotonous in its negative reading ( only a few ) : mon/":1/ ( at least ) a few linguists implement , then a few linguists work . 
mon ~ , :*' If ( only ) a few linguists work , then ( only ) a few linguists implement . 
monf:*If ( only ) a few linguists implement , hen only a few linguists work . 
The fact that negation reverses monotonicity is realized with mass nouns and pluralized count nouns which in their positive reading appear with zero-article  . In the positive reading which is ment the partitive article is used in French : If there is wine that contains  12% alcohol , then there is wine that contains alcohol . 
If there are wine bottles that contain 12% alcohol , then there are wine bottles that contain alcohol . 
S'ilya duvinquicontient12% d'alcool , ilya duvin qui contient del ' alcool . 
S'ilya desbouteilles de vinqui contiennent 12% d ' alcool , ilya desboute illes de vinqui contiennent de/ 'alcool  . 
In the negative reading which is monlsimple de instead of the partitive article is used in French : If there is no wine that contains alcohol  , then there is no wine that contains 12% alcool . 
If there are no bottles of wine that contain alcohol  , then there are no bottles of wine that contain 12% alcool . 
S'iln'ya pas dev inqui contient d'al cool , iln'ya pas dev inqui contient 12% del'al cool . 
S'iln ' a pas deboute illes dev inqui contiennent d ' alcool  , i l . n'y a pas deboute illes dev inqui contiennent de l ' alcool  . 
6 . The organization of the semantic features of determination As an overview let us give a graphical representation of the organization of the features  . In this representation the ENTITY-node is the axiom and each node is subspecified either by a disjunction of features  , which were present by the solid lined edges , or by a conjunction of features which we indicate by the "+" marked edges  .

Summary We have illustrated several semantic representations which are meant to guarantee the correct generation of different surface structures of quantifiers  . The intricate interwovenness between lexical and grammatical quantification has been outlined  . In some cases as for example in the case of " collective " and " discrete " or " individual " and " atomic " " discontinuity " the ambiguity could not be resolved  .

ZELINSKY-WIBBELT 1988a and 19874 , Advice is enumerable by the " numerative " piece in contrasto other " abstract " English " mass " nouns like patience  , faith , dignity , behaviour , research . We hypothesize that the " numerative " piece in English has a similar function as the plural morpheme has in German with nouns designating " abstract " mass " entities which are " discontinuous " which means that several exemplars of anatomic entity may be merged into a discretensemble  ( cf . LObel 1986) .
