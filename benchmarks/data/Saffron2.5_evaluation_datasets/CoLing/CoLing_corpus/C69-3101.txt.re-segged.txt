1.1 The Systemiln gleneral
Since The MT-System of IBM Germany has already been described 
elsewhere\[5\]\[63 , we shall confine us to the aspects of the
system which are substantial to our problem.
The system consists of two linguistically significant parts : a machine lexicon residing on a direct access device and a program package  . The machine lexicon contains :
I . English words , 2 . a code providing grammatical information about each word  ,  3 . German equivalents . 
In case of more Than one possible German equivalent of an English word  , there are-roughly spoken-as many separate lexicon entries in the machine lexicon as German Translations  . 
To put it in a more precise way : for an English homograph  , redundant as it may be , there is a separate lexicon entry for each v of its syntactic funtions  , i . e . an English word like CHANGE has been entered in the lexicon as a noun CHANGE  , with the German translation : KNDERUNG and also as a verb-CHANGE  , with the Translation VERXN DERN . The order of entries is fixed . 
While The machine lexicon provides each English word with one or more German equivalents  , the program package operating on the lexicon develops the proper Translation for the English input text  . 
The first step of processing is the lexical assignment  , i . e . 
each English word is looked up in The machine lexicon and its first occurence in The lexicon is Taken as the provisional translation ~ The following steps care for the proper choice of the German equivalents from Those other alternat ives provided by the lexicon  , which remain accessible throughout the entire subsequent processing  . In order to choose the correct equivalent , The programs rely on the original word order of the English input text and the codes which are primarily drawn from the lexicon  . 
Generally it can be said , that as the processing progresses , we have more and more information about Thel inguistic structures at our disposal  , and we can make increasingly subtle decisions . It is obvious that to distinguish between verbs and nouns is logically prior to the distinction between  , say , abstract nouns and concrete nouns . ( In praxi , however , the sequence of subroutines may not always be as simple as that  . ) Similarly , we can distinguish between transitive , reflexive and intransitive verbs , only after having established the category of verbs in general  , i . e . 
after the solution of homographs like :
PLACE noun PLACE verb
CHANGE noun CHANGE verb
Although the disambiguation of syntactic homographs is by no means a trivial task  , we shall not go into further details about its actual realisation  . 
For the following discussion we shall therefore presume  , that occurring syntactic homographs have been solved  . 
2.0 The Problem
Consider the following sentence pairs : lie ) The company has increased the production . 
( Ib ) The production has increased rapidly.
(2a ) Register 3 returned the value unchanged.
(2b ) The accessarm returned to its original position  . 
It is clear that the ( a ) and ( b ) sentences have to be translated in a different way:  ( la " ) DigGesgllschaft hat digProd~ktiongrhoeht Q  ( Ib " ) Dig Produktion hatsichschneller hoe-~t- . 
(2a " ) Register 3 brachteden Weftunvera end grt zurueck . 
(2b " ) DerZugriffarm - - ~ r tezus giner u rspruenglichen 
Position zurue c~-.
It is not difficult to see that the linguist ically relevant criterion for the proper German translation is the presence or absence of a direct object-NP  . For the German translation of ( Ib ) the implicit object must be made explicit by the insertion of the German reflexive pronoun SICH  . In the second example we have to select two differe ~ r<t verbs to render both  ( 2a ) and ( 2b ) correctly into German 2 ~ . 
2.1 A first approximation
As a ~ irata ~ proximation the following scheme can be proposed ~: EUV-~V transitiv ~-+ transitiv NP  ( R2' ) I-+traVnsitive I1 . . . t ~- traVsitive ~ Jote that ( RI ' ) and ( R2' ) must follow each other immediately , otherwise the environment in ( R2' ) must be made explicit . 
Note also that verbs like INCREASE need not be mentioned at all : they can be marked in the lexicon as invariably + transitive \]  , to which the missing formal object should be inserted on the German side by another rule :  ( R3' ) transitiv_~~-transitiv/~X
Conditions : X contains no NP ;
X may be O.
As the final step , the correct German equivalent has to be determined by the English verb and the feature \[ +transitiv ~ or\[-transitive ~  ; to secure the proper translation we have to provide appropriate lexicon entries for the rules  :   ( LI ) 

L21s TEIGN(L3) I+RETURN ~_ transitive ~ U
I+ZUROCKBRINGEN\]transitive\]J ( L4 ) ~_ _ RETURN ~ ZUROCKKEHREN -- transitive ~ J > I -transitive ~  1 In order to be able to cope with reflexives of variable verb stems like : CHANGE--VER~NDERN ~__/SICH  2\[NDERN 
MOVE - - 0BERTRAGEN ~JSICHBE WEGEN it is necessary to mark reflexives in  ( R3' ) by an additional feature : Ivel transitiv reflexive  71 /re X
Conditions : X contains no NP ;
X may be O.
2.2 Clause boundaries
This basic scheme has to be made somewhat more precise  . 
Consider : ( 5 ) AS data processing needs have increased , the basle card 1 . an@uase remained the same . 
Without referring to the clause boundary after the word INCREASED  , the following NP ( = subject of the next clause ) would be interpreted as an object belonging to the verb 

Thus the environment in ( RI ' )   ( and accordingly also in ( R2' ) and ( R3" ) ) has to be further specified : in addition to requirement  , that the NP immediately follows the verb , we must also demand that the NP may not be separated from the verb by a sentence boundary  . This means that the NP must belong to the same clause as the verb  . 
This can be done on the basis of the sentence analysis  , which is motivated independently from the cu~r ~ rent problem  , and the results of which remain accessible ~ . Thus the final set of rules would read as follows  :   ( RI ) transit ivf ? transitiv-----__NP ( R2 ) !_+tranVitivii ~ . ~! Ztran Vsitiv I(R3) i-ViJ!\[+transitiv . '- J " ~ I + transitiv/reflexive ~

Conditions : X contains no NP ;
X may be 0.

Symbolg ~ means that we restrict the applicability of our rules t ~ one and the same clause  . 
2.3 Passive-voice verbal constructions
Furthermore we should also be able to treat sentences like the following :  ( 4 ) It has been returned to the initial posit ion  . 
(4" ) Esistzuderursg ~ ruengli~hen Position zurue ck-gg bracht word gn ~  . 
6 (5) If the disk has Seenmounted , start the machine . 
(5") Wenn die Plattemontiert wordenist , startedie Maschine . 
In order to get the required feature \[+ transitive \] in spite of the physical lack of a direct object NP in the terminal string ~ we have to ' recognize passive-voice constructions as such  . 
The passive recognition should preeeed ( RI ) and should discover the object of the main verb , otherwise ( R2 ) treats sentences like ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) as intransitives , after which we have to eliminate the consequences of this misinterpretation  . Presuming unique morphological marking of passive -voice the following recognition rule would be sufficient for the present purpose :  ( R4 ) NP-S
Vnlii X transitiv rP ~ VP ver ~" pas . sive\]\]-S
Conditions : X ~ V contains no NP
V4. n .., transltlv ~!
I < 5passiv ~\] iver D\[vP
X may be O.
( R4) preceeds ( R1).
For the further discussion note that the passi~v ~ recognition uneseapably involves hierarchical structures  6~   . 
3.1 Motion verbs
There are some subsidiary problems arising after the exchange of the transitive form of a multifunctional verb against its intransitive correspondence  . 
Consider : ( 6 ) The temperature ha~dropped rapidly . 
(6 '  ) Die Temperaturhat ~ allen 8e?a ~ senschnell . 
(6") Die Tampar at arhatg cfallen ~ chnell.
Inspire of the correct translation of the main verb  , sentence (6") is still false , because fallen-fiel-~e-fallen counts as a motion verb  , and as such it takes the ~ ary verb sein in perfect tense  . Therefore provision must be made to provide the proper auxiliaries for the motion verbs in perfext tense  . The actual exchange of the auxiliary might be postponed to a later step  , if the appropriate marking is provided by the lexicon  . 

(L2' ) I-MOUNT\]FSTEIGEN \]~-- transitive ll "'-~- I\ [- transitive\]i---L\[+motion \] J  ( L4' ) transitive \] J . 

I ~- transitive ~ l ! t , t , , , otioj
Since the auxiliary selection has to be done for all motion verbs in perfect tense  , i . e . also for the non-homographic type like has arrivedi  . stange kommen has goneist gegan gen etc . , it is practical to place the auxiliary ~ election behind  ( RI )  -  ( R3 ) and even after the insertion of the improved , intransitive entries (( L2') , ( R5) ( L ~' and the like):
Vn-Vn
XHABENX transitiv ~ SEINX transitiv ; motion \] motion \] . 
verb ~ erb
Thus ( R5 ) would automatically pmoduce : ( 6'" ) Pie Temperat ~ ristgcfallen ~ chnzll . 
3.2 Order of composite verbs
Let us consider the order of primary elements of composite verbs like: 
STOPSTEHEN BLEIBEN
DROPF ALLENL ASSEN
In order to be able to manipulate each unit separately it is expedient to set up two words on the German side: 
STOP ~' STEHEN

DROP/FALLEN " LASSEN ~
At this point however we have to ask which of the two possibilities is the preferable order : 
STEHEN or BLEIBEN ?
BLEIBENSTEHEN
When generating the final German word order , all composite verbs have to be inverted . 
This inversion routine consists of a set of rules ( 7 )   . 
The rule for subordinate clauses operates aecording to the following basic scheme :  ( R 6 ) SD:IX-IvX-Vnl-IV restll-~erb
SC:1204+3
Conditions : S is a subordinate clause ( i . e . it is dominated by another symbol );
X may be an empty string;
Vn is the last part of the verb.
An inversion is necessary in any case independently of the present issue  , also for sentences like (1)-(4) , for which we have tacitly assumed the existence of a verb inversion routine \[  7   7   . 
We should like to translate correctly sentences like:  ( 71  ( 7' ) 
It aa use ~ the machine to stop.
z u~stehen7 Esvzran lasst die Masahine ~ bleiben ~ At the first sight it appears that sentence  ( Ta ' ) Esveranlasst die Maschine zustehenblg iben  . 
sounds better than : ( 7b ' ) Esveranlas ~ tdie Maschine zublgibenst ghen . 
But if we make the verb inversion rule ( R 6 ) also for ( 7 ) applicable the verb will be automatically inverted  . Thus (7b ') is preferable to (7a ') , since ( R 6 ) yields the correct translation out of ( 7b ' )  , but not out of (7a ') . All what we have to do is to treat the infinit ivezuble iben as a unit :  ( 7"  1 Esv gran lass tdig M as a hine zublgibznst ghen . 
verb\[ . .~ J 2nd application : n=1 ( 7"' ) E~vgranlasst die Masa'hing~tchen"z~b l giben  . 
( R6) applies first vacuously , i . e . it effects only the marking , but not the physical sequence of the constituents  , since V ? . rest is an empty string . The variable zuble iben is the remaln aer of the verb constituent after the separation of the last independent morphological unit  . At the second application , there is a Vt produeed by step 1 , ( R6) places the no , last-and only-m~er of the verb constituent after Vrest ~  . 

These considerations show also the crucial importance of the ordering of rules and subroutines  . We can solve the sequencing of the newly inserted compound verbs with minimal effort  , if we have the verb inversion routines run after the disambiguation of the transitive/intransit ive verbs  . 
4.0 Theoretical implications
Finally I should like to point out a theoretical implication of the present problem which might have bearings on linguistic analysis in general  . 
In a formal linguistic analysis it is unavoidable to set out from the information directly available in the terminal string  . 
This primary information is organised necessarily in a linear fashion  . 
As the analysis proceeds the possibility emerges to organize the linguistic information in a non-linear  , hierarchical way . 
The results of the analysis steps can be used to find and mark the boundaries of the clauses  , to recognize the individual constituents within the larger units  , i . e . to build upatentative constituent structure . 
As the disambiguation of verb with multiple meaning shows  , we have to rely on hierarchically organized information in order to make the proper choice between transitive and intransitive usages even in this rather simple ease  . To solve the polysemy of the verbs in questions , we have to be able to find out that an NP is dominated directly by a VP and that this VP dominates directly a verb  , which is in turn marked in an specific way . 
Our transformation terminology , and the fact , that the systems lends itself readily for such a reinterpretation suggest our conclusion : We claim that the MT system described above uses transformational rules  . 
This claim is supported 1 . by the hierarchical organization of grammatical information  , which is the computational representation of phrase markers  ( trees )  . 
2 . - and this is the main point-by our reinterpretation of the computational algorithms as mapping of phrase markers into phrase markers  \[2\]   \[3\] 

This implication seems interesting for the fol lowing reason  . The MT system of IBM Germany has grown out of the intention to create a translating tool for practical purposes  . The system was developed in a basically empirical manner  ; problems were attacked at points , where we hoped to find the easiest way to the solution  . A general frame of action has been invented , rules have been worked out and ordered coding considerations have been made  , but it is only in retrospect that the theoretical evaluation of the system has become possible  . 
On the whole the system , heterogeneous as it is , resembles the fulcrum type of MT-scheme , operating on a different language pair as Garvin 's system  \[1\]   . We have tried to show , however , that even the empirical approach felt the need for multidimensional structuring  , and certain rules setup on empirical consider at ions-e  . g . those treating verb with multiple meaning- turn out to be mappings of phrase markers into phrase markers in the transformational sense  . -  .   .   .   .   .   . 


In the past years the Department of Basic Research IBM Germany developed an experimental Machine Translation System to translate technical texts on data processing and electronics from English into German  . This MT system displays some resemblances with the Fulcrum-type of systems  , but at least some of its subroutines contain also transformational devices  . 
The treatment of verbs with multiple meaning of the type CHANGE-VER~NDERN-SICH~NDERN is one of these cases  . The correct recognition of the passive voice and direct objects presuppose hierarchically organised and permanently accessible syntactic markers  . 
While presenting this rather special case it has been attempted to show some further aspects as well as the general functioning of the system  . 
The MT-SY stem represents a team work : the author of the present paper thanks especially Mrs  . Brigitte Schirmer and Mr . Reinhart Herzog for reading and criticizing the first version of the manuscript  . 

Footnotes ??????
Our German translation may deviate occasionally , e . g . 
with regard to prepositions , from the common usage , since we draw the examples from our actual output . 
_Th . e . _following verbs display the same regularity :
Typ1: transitive ~ reflexive
CHANGE VERKNDERN
REVOL VED REHEN
INCREASEERHOHEN
DECREASE VERMINDERN
MOVE OBER TRAGEN etc.
SICHANDERN
SICHDREHEN
SICHERHOHEN
SICHVER MINDERN
SICHBE WEGEN
Typ2: transitive-vin transitive
MOUNT MONTIERENS TEIGEN
RETURN ZUROCKBRINGEN ZURO CKKEHREN
CONTINUEFORTSETZENFORTFAHREN
DRO PFALLEN LASSEN FALLEN etc.
In our notation symbols refer to code information , provided primarily by the word assignment routines  , and - as we have already pointed out-improved by the syntactic component of the system  . We differentiate F category symbols from features by putting the latter in\[The symbol X denotes strings having no relevance to the rules  . 
Although the description of the voluminous analysis is beyond the scope of the present discussion  , its concept influences also the treatment of verbs with multiple meaning  . E . g . in ( RI ' ) we must know whether the constituent NP comprises initial adverbs on not  . To dinstinguish an initial adverb dominated by an NP from an adverb merely preeeeding on NP  ( but no ? dominated by it ) is extremely complicated . If this distinction is not made , adverbs standing betw % enverbs and NP-s must be jumped over  . 
We cannot deal here with all problems arising , while translating the sentences . We shall return to the problem how to generate the correct German word order in  3  . 2 . 
The actual machine realisation does not affect the basic properties of the passive recognition  ( Rq )  ; since in the actual system English verbs ~ which may be transitive and 
J ? intransitive , are provided uniformly with a transitive German e or respondence in the first place  , it is enough to recognize the passives and approve the given choice by taking no action  . The actual recovery of the deep object of passive sentences seems to be redundant  , since English passives correspond normally to passives in German  . 
The rule appying to main clauses is more complicated  . 
Therefore we have chosen the simpler rule for subordinate clauses  , which suffices to illustrate the principle of verb conversion  . 
A similar reasoning speaks for separating prefixes from main verbs and placing prefixes after the verb stems : BRING EN ZUROCK  , KEHREN ZUROCK usw . The entries in machine lexicon are actually in this sequence  .
