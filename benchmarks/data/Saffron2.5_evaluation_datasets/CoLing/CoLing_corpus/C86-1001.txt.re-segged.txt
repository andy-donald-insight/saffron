The essent i ~ d feature of a lexicon-grammar is that the elementary unit of computation and storage is the simple sentence : sn bleet-verb-complement  ( s )  . -this type of representation is obviously needed for verbs : limiting a verb to its shape has no meaning other than typographic  , ~ ir\]ceaver b cannot be separated from its subject and essential coreplemenl  ( s )  2 . We have shown ( M , Gross 1975) that given a verb , Or equivalently a simple sentence , the set of syntactic properties that describes its variations is unique : in general  , no ether verb has an identical syntactic paradigm  3  . As a consequence , the properties of each verbal construction must be represented in a texicon--grammar  . The lexicon has no significance taken as an isolated component and the gr ~ rnmartempera : at  , viewed as independent of the lexicon , will have to be limited to certain complex sentences  , Since be-A diective tetras are close to verbs , their description is quite similar , that is , they are considered as sentences . 
We have a pllied lexicon-grammar representation not only to the two obvious predicative parts of speech  , verb and adjective , but to nouns and adverbs a ~; well . In the same way as one adjoins the verb to betn adjectives  , we have ~ y stematically introduced support verbs ( V sup ) for nouns and adverbs , as in the following examples ( Z . S , Harris 1976, M . Gross 1982, 1986):
Vsup:::f Obe Prep:
The textia in contradiction with the low
VSUp = : to h~ve
This text has a certain importance for Bob 4
Vsup = : tOoccur , etc.

2 . The notion of essential complement has been refined through the systematic study of  12  , 000 verbs of French ( M . Gross 1975; J,-P . Boons , A . Gaillet , C . Locl ~ re19 Y Ga , 1976b , 1987) and a study of adverbials , that is , of nonessential complements ( M . Gross 19~6) . The subject arKI/or the con'lplements may be transformed and/or omitted through various syntactic operations  , in particular , by nominalizing the verb ( G . Gross , R . Vivbs 198E ;) , but the full information can be recovered ( Z . S . Harris 1982) . 
3 . Aline of '~+'" and ""'" marks in FiGure 1 is such a paradigm . 
4 . Both examples are not isolated entries of the lexicon = grammar  , but rather ( Z , S , Harris 1964) , transforms of other forms : fhJ~text <:: ontradi /  . ; tathe law
This text is important for Bob $ apport verbs are frequerd in technical texts  , and may have stylistic variants , as in this last example , Grammatical elements such as determiners , prepositions and conjunctions , do not belong to the lexicon-grammar in the same sense as the four major parts of speech do  , siece they are parts ot structures or rules . For example , prepositions appear in the columns ef the lexicon -grammar  . 
An early representation of verbs in a lexicon -grammar of about  12  , 000 verbs is ftiven in figure t . Each row of the matrix is an entry whose main construction is defined by a table or class code  . In figure I , the codeG corresponds to the class of constructions : subject-verb-direct sentential complement  , noted : ( 1 ) NOV qee P ( NOts the subject and P stands for sentence )  . 
Each column is a syntactic property , and corresponds to a structure into which V may enter  , roughly a syntactic transform of the main structure  , ~ or example , in columns we have placed the Passive forms , Extraposed and renominal forms . Thus , the related structures are semantically close . 
"+" signat the intersection of a row and a column indicates that then try in the row is accepted in the structure associated to the column  , "-" sign correspoeds to inacceptability . The process of accumulation that led to the formalized lexicon-grammar of  12  , 0 00 French verbs has run into what seemed to be at first a minor problem of representation of words : the difference between simple and compound words  , On the one hand , there are simple words ~ uc has the verb know and complex  ( idiomatic ) forms such as keep in mind , Both forms play the same syet actic arid semantic role in sentences such as: 
Bob knows that Maxha ~ moved to Tampa
Bob keeps in mind that Max / ) as moved to Tampa bat the lexical content ( one word vathree ) requires different identification procedures ( simple dictionary took tJp vs a certain amount of syntactic analyss  )  . 
The representation of fiGUre 1 treats two forms such as to know (  , ~erneone , something ) arid to keep ( someone , something \] in mind mtf~same way , thut ~ emphasizing the semantic equivalence between simple and compound verbs  , Betcompoged terms raise ~ ; i problem of representation . The unit of representation in a linear lexicon is roughly the word  5 as defined by its written form , that is , a . ~equence of letters separated from ne~lhb Oring sequences by boundary bionic  . As a consequence , compound words cam of be directly put into a dictionary the way simple words are  . 
Aaiden Uficatior procedure i : ~ needed for their occurrences in texts  , and thi~procedure will make use of the various simple parts of the compound utterance  . Hence , the formal linguistic properties of con'lpouud terms will determine both the procedure of ideetifiea U on in text ~ and the type of storage they require  .

We thus have to discuss the main types of compounds and to single out those properties that bear on automatic parsing and dictionary lookup  . 
1. Compound adverbs
We call adverb any circumstancial complement , including sentent ) alphrases , as in the following examples : ( 1 ) The show took place nighlly elnight during a busy night the night Bob missed his plane By compound adverbs  , or frozen or idiomatic adverbs , we mean adverbs that can be separated into several words  , with some or all of their words frozen , that is , semantically and/or syntactically noncomposit ional  . In (1) , afnight is a compound adverb , the lack of compositionality is apparent f rom lexical restrictions such as :* at day  , * at afterno on , * at evening and by the impossibility of inserting material that is a priori plausib le  , syntactically and semantically : * at ( coming . present ) night*st(cold , dark ) night during the ( coming , present ) night durings ( cold , dark ) night5 . Note that words or roots are often considered as units in most attempts to devise semantic representations  . 
Notice that nightly can also be considered as a frozen compound  , though not constituted of words but Of a word and a suffix  . Again , lack of compositionality stems from the observation that daily  , weekly , monthly , yearly , etc . which are compounds of the same formal type have a regular formation  , in the sense that their interpretation is homogeneous  . Thus , nightly is an isolated case , as opposed to an open series of identical forms with a different interpretation  . 
The two other adverbs of (1) are tree forms . Thus , the determiners Det and modifiers ( Adl and Re/clause ) of : duringDetAdjnightRel clauae can vary freely  ( within semantic constraints )  . In the same way , tfm event associated with the sentence 8 in the form : the night ( E , that )   8 can be expressed by a large variety of unconst rained forms  . 
Frozen or compound adverbs constitute the simplest case of compound forms because they do not allow variations of their components  . As mentioned above , in at night no adjective is authorized . Moreover , one cannot inserta determiner : * at ( a , this ) night , the plural is forbidden :* at nights and no relative clause can be appended : * Mnight  ( that , which ) was agreed on . 
Such observations are general , and apply to many adverbs of varied form and lex ical content : 
I trained cats and dogs * many cats and dogs * big cats and dogs * cat and dog from time to tit ~ e ~ trorntime t ~ to times * from a time to another time from long time to long time Consequently  , these compound adverbs could be identified by a simple recognRi or r procedure  , for they do not require anylei , a matization or syntactic analysis to be reduced to a dictionary form  , as is the case with verb for ) as for example . 
A lexieal study of compound adverbs has been performed in French and a systematic inventory has been compiled from various dictionaries  . 
Runni , gtexts have been examined as well . It is interesting to note that whereas in current dictionaries there are about  1  , 500 one word adverbs , most of them in-meat (- ly ) , we have found over 5 , 000 compound adverbs , These compound adverbs have been classihed according to their sywtaclt c shape  . The syntactic forms are described at the elementary level ef sequences of fmrts of speech  . We use symbols with obvious interpretations such as Prep  , Dot , Adl , N , V , COOl ( fay conjunction ) and W for a variable ranging over verb complements  , etc . We write:
PrepN =: at night
PrepDotN =: in the end
PrepDotAdfN =: in the long rim
Prop Oel , NelDotN =: in every nonce of the word at the point of a gun PropDef NCeniDotN =: time and again 
VW =: to begin with
S =: all things being equal

Frozen Adverbs ( t4.(; ros ;, s19~6)
Tableau2
The examples discussed an far are entirely frozen . Itence , as ai ) vuctical matter , they can be locatediua text by using the search function available for strings in any text editor system  . There are however more complex examples that require deeper analysis  . Consider fay example the idiomatic adverb in the sentence : Max propoaed  8ohrtiena from l , he top of his hat Itic largely frozen : no other determiner is allowed  , no adjectives can be appended to either noun , etc . , but the person of the possessive adject ive Pone  , may vary . This possessive adjective must refer to the sub ject of the sentence  , and varies accordingly : * Max propound ideas from the topely our hat * Mystaler proposed ideas from the top of his hat Bob and Max proposed ideas from the top of their hat  ( 8 ) In this case . the recognition procedure is no longer a simple string matching operation  , since a variable slot must be dealt with inside the fixed string  . More general matching rules are required here 6 . Once this compound adverb l , laabeen identified in a text to be processed , it can be given an iater pt ~ etation , for example in terms of a simple adverb such as tei aarely or lightly and the referential in formation carried by Pots can then be ignored  . I to we ver , one o ar \] easily construct particular discourses where the obligatory ce reference relation involved will  ( bs ambiguate some analysis . Thus , not only the variatien of Poa a must be accounted l  , or at the lexical level , but its referential infermatien has to be kept l  , or possible use in a parser . 
fiber compound adverbs oiler different degrees of variation  . The rem'e cases where one part of the adverb is frozen and another part is entirely free : Maxorganized a party in honor of Bob Maxhid the car at the far end of the parking lot The parts in honor  , althe far end are frozen . For example , they do not allow modil , iers . The parts of N are tree , for we observe variations such as:
Maxorganized aparty in hJahon or
Maxhid the car at the larend , I think , of the parking lot
Consider the adverbials : for the sake of ru in ing thin fjs for the sake of Bob for God's sake We  ( : all the combinatien for--cake frozen , since the noun sake does not occur elsewhere than in adverbial phrases with the preposition for : it cannot be the subject or object of any verb  . 
On the other hand , the modifiers of sake are quite varied and regular from the point of view of the syntax of noun modifiers  7  . 
There are also cases of seemingly free adverbs which require an adhoc treatment  . For example , dates such as:
Monday March 13, 1968 at 9pan.
are described it ) a natural way by a finite automaton . 
Tecl ; nical or specialized families of adverbs come close to being frozeu adverbs :  ( 2 ) The yelected Bob on the ( firsl , second ) ballot ( 3 ) Maxate his no odles in a bow/The special semantic relations that hold between the adverbial complement and the restel  , the sentence are lirmted . There are few verbs such as to eat which combine within a bowl and which have the nonlocative interpretation of  ( 3 )  . The usual interpretation is thai found in : 6 . PRDLOG rules are particularly well adapted to recognizing such frozen forms  ( P . Sabatier 1980) . 
7 . There are nonetheless restrictions on them : ~ for a heavenly  , ~ oke
Maxpu Fhianoodle ~ in a bowl
Entering I Tozen adverbs into a lexicon-grammar raises many r = ew questions  , The bulk of adverbs can be described by means of the Following type of derivation  ( Z . S , Harris 197?): Bobleft ; 7 hat Bob left occurred at 9: Bobleft , fhia occurred at 9 : : Bobleft at 9 and sulaport verbs play a crucial role here . However , there are cases where no general support verb is found and where adverbs have to be considered as a part of the elementary sentence  . Consider the adverb in:
Bob sang at the top of hJ ~ voice
It is syntactically and semantically analogous to tree adverbs such as noisily  , power felly . For these two free adverbs , a derivational source involving the adject ive is available : The way Bob sang was  ( noiay , power tn / ) This is not the case for at the top of his voice which is practically limited to modifying the verbs of saying  . Moreover the obbgatory coreference link of hi a leads to a representation where this adverb is not analyzed  . Thus two semantically similar types of adverbs have to be represented quite differently in the lexicon-grammar  . 
All the situations just exemplified with adverbs are quite common  , cod are also encountered with nouns , adjectives and verbs . The paradoxel ~ relaresent at J on they lead to can only be solved by introducing a complex level of semantic equivalence for the entries of the lexicon-grammar  ,  2 , Compound nouns C~n'n pound nouns form the bulk of the lexicon of languages  . Language creativity is largely associated with the growth of technical vocabularies which consist mainly of technical nouns  . Compound nouns number in the millions for European laoguages  . They are usually builtrrem the vocabulary of simple words by means or grammatical rules which may involve grammatical words  . By definition , their meaniog is nencompositional . The compound nouns can be described in terms of the sequence of their grammatical categories  , in the same way as for adverbs ( IA . Gross , D . Tremblay 1985) . We have for example:
Det N = : the moon
Adl N = : crudeoil , realeala Fe
N of N = : elroke of luck , board of ( governors , regenfa ) Det N of Dot N = : the talk of the town
NN=:lest lobe , color 7V
Such nouns can become quite complex in various technical Fields  . 
In general , compound nouns allow variations of determiners and modifiers  , but many situations are encountered : the moon is a frozen combination  , --definite article-noun--which behaves like a proper name  , because ot its unicity of reference . It cannot be modified by adjectives without losing its reference : * the  ( big , yellow ) moon ; crude oil takes restricted determiners . Since it is a mass noun , there are difficulties in accepting its plural , It can be modified by adjectives and nouns as in ( cheap , high quality ) crudeo H , but these cannot modify el/:*crude , ( cheap , high quality ) oil ; stroke of luck has unrestricted determiners and modifiers  , bat no iosertion is allowed immediately before or next to of  , in particular luck cannot be modified : * stroke of gor ~ luck S  ;  8 .  ~ , lrnko of badluck would be a different compound word  , whose relation to a froke of luck is only etymological  . 
-board of governors one be modified in several ways : boarda ~ ldg overnor at a  . keseparate determiners and modifiers : ~ he powerful boarda of the twelveg over nora of my bank  , Such a compound noun comes close to being a free Form  . It is the liruited number of second aeons such as director  , governor or regent that suggests we are dealing with a compound noun  . Also , the meameg of these phrases is no noom poaitional in the sense that they have a legal or institut ional meaoing that their components do not have clearly  . 
The variations of lurer we have enumerated can be partly hal'=died bit at lcachiaga finite automaton to a given entry  , and this automaton will describe the main grammatical changes allowed The adjunction o ~ free relative clauses to compound nouns may requ irea different treatment " l ~  ) ekiads of variation of compound nouns are a O numereu  , ~ that cletermieing whether a given nomit ) alcoostruction is a compouod noun or nol : almost requires c ~  . original demonstratiou .

Determining the sup~mrt verbs for compound nouns does  ) to t seem to raise other probletes than those encountered with simple nouns  .

From the point ot view developped here , that is , the representation in terms of sequences of grammatical categories allowing for efficient matching procedures witt  ) texts , th  ~ . , y do not differ from adverbs and nouns . 
Examples are:

Bob is the world's ( beat , worat ) teacher They discuss edit , on a take it or leave it basis 3 . Compound verbs Compound verbs or frozer l sentences as we have termed them  ( M . Gross 1982) , can be described as sequences of categories . We write Ni for variable noun phrases and Ci for frozen noun phrases  . For subjects ; i = 0, for complements : i = I,2 . Examples are: ( I ) NOVC t=:Bob hit the/ackpot ( 2 ) N 0 VN 1 Prep C 2 = : Bob took your project into account ( 3 ) N 0 VCI Prep C 2 = : Bo blook the bull by I heher on ( 4 ) N ? ~ C 0 VC t = : Bob ' adream came true We outlined in I the description ot a lexicon-grammar of French v ~ bs and the reasons why compound verbs had to be separated from simple 

~ ; y stematic search through dictionaries ( monoling a al , bilingual , and specialized ) has yielded close to 20 , 0 00 compound verbs belonging to the same level of language as the  12  , 000 simple verbs . A syntactic classification has been built for them  ( Figure 3 )  . 
Compound verbs are the most complex Forms that have to be entered into a lexicon?t  . The compounds discussed previously were simple 9 . There are however a limited number of frozen discourses such as : If wa  , s for all I he worldaa it SW hich need an extra level of complexity  ( L . Danlos 19B5) .

10 + As a matter of fact , when an utterance is found to be ambiguous , with one analysis as a frozen form and the other as a freeform  , ignoring competing freeforms altogether is a good parsing strategy  ,  4 .

For example  , there is no reason to attach the Passive marking to the verb rather than to either of the complements of the utterance to put the cart before the horse  , Lexicon-grammar representations eliminate such questions by do localizing the syntactic information and by attaching it to the full sentence  , In this sense , compound expressions provide a powerful n\ ]etivation for representing lexical and syntactic phenomena in the form of a lexicon-grammar  . 
11 . Thesaree use of se ( luences of syntactic categories is found in n string grammar  ( Z . S+Harris 1961) , which has proven to be quite efficient in syntactic recognition  ( N , Sager 1981 , M . Salkoff 1973, 1979) .
