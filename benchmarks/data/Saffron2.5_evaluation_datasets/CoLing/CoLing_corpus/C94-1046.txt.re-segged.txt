It is highly desirable that users of systems which include NLP-based components  , ranging from grmn mar-checkers to MT systems , can access the underlying Linguistic Knowledge Base in a natural and gratifying way  . Our research aims at developing such Linguistic Discovery Assistants by merging hyperdocum cnts  , Data Base Management Systems and interpretive adaptive interfaces  . 
We have followed a stepwise approach to the idea in the context of the discovery and learning of lcxical properties of Chinese e h  , ' uacters , by developing several prototypes . We see this system as a facet of a broader base including dictionary knowledge  .

DISCOVERY ORLE ARNING OF LINGUIS TIC
KNOWLEDGE 1 . 1 A need for making linguistic knowledge accessible to the user  , in Personal MTA current rend in Personal Machine Translation tends towards opening to then ser the linguistic data that the system is operating upon  \[1\]  . Such'discoverable'environments should allow some free  , self-plmmed , or coached investigation to users , and provide these in a suitable xpl~matory fonn with al  , ' u ' gepart of the linguistic materia lemba ) dicd in the personalling warc : lexical data bases  , syntactic patterns or syntactic rules modules , semantic on lrastive aspects , etc . 
Our work is oriented towards a particular aspect of such ' openling w are ': the grasp  , evc nlu : dly the learning , by monolinguai writers or editors of a document who are working in a language they know imperfectly  , of the lexical proi ' , cr ties of the language to be used . 
1 . 2 A new resource different from dictionaries In the context of lexical properties we may at first consider dictionaries to be a straight rcsponsc to such a demand  . They usually require of the user some premodelled view of the very organic ' alton of the lexical data  , a pragmatic know-how of their legibility , or real mastery in order for the searcher user to perform a sensible pruning of the available information  . This is particularly true with the lexieal properties of the languages we are concerned with in this project  , Chinese and Japanese . 
Users may experience thccomplexity of the process when  , starting from uncertain or incomplete chunks of recollected knowledge  , they wish to investigate a word to be , 'ts certained , a num ~ ce to be expressed , an ideogram to be remembered . Such situations clearly demand are shaping of dictionaries as interactive knowledge bases  , and the proposal of components and coopemlive interfaces wl fich could offer altenmt e access chemes to lexic ~ data b : t ~ es  , or views of them\[11\] . 
Some integrated systems for I ) ialogue Based Machine'l'rm~s lation itend to provide the author with the means for interactive consulting of linguistic facts or rules  , for instance in the context of lexical or syntactical disambiguation or indirect pre -editing of contextual semantic features  , specific to the text to be composed . The I . IDIA architecture\[2\] and the NAI ) IA model\[9\] certainly illustrate this approach . 
1 . 3 Discovery Assistants , Cooperative Observatories The development of interactive n vironments for monoling nal writers leads to modelling new functions for documentation  , self-documentation , self-learning and management of indivitlualized personal knowledge bases  , to bcpooled into opcnency clopaedic'discovery environments '  , pecific components for NLP systems . 
Such technologies as hyperdocuments , multimed i and voiced databases , adaptive interfaces , and the benefits of Computer Aidedl . earning techniques may merge to offer solutions in the reahn of such'cooperative obserwttorics ' of linguistic knowledge  . 
Our project has a stepwise approach to the idea , in the e:tse of the lexical properties of the Chinese ideograms  . 
2. PROJECTOUTLINE ANDPROTOTYPIN(;
SCIIEME 2 . 1 Comlmter Aided Chinese Characterl , earning The work we report here stems from the initial m  ( )delling of an AAOCC systcm ( for ' Apprcntissage Assist6 par Ordinat cur des Caract & es Chinois ' )  , intended to provide motivated users with an adaptive n viromn cnt for the atltonomous discovery or rcvic w of character properties Idl  , with a deliberate restriction to a hanzi/kanji subset of characters  . 
llan-zi simply means Chinese ( ~ aractel , and kanji ( which all iterates the Jboner , and means the same in Japatws e ) t'~'t w to a small subset of characters that written Japanese almost entirely borlmved from hanz L and fivm the combination of which Japanese words are derived  . We shall call ' hanzi/kanji'the intersection set  , that is the hanzi which also are Japanese kataji . 
The concept u : d model of the lcxical database schematizes different views and levels of investigation of the material  . 
A first alternative lortheuser is to explore a language-independent view  ( Fig .  1 ) of the characters ( intrinsic moq ~ ho-semantic properties of the hanzi / kanji  , shared by written Chinese , Japanese and Korean ) , contrasting with language-related views ( Fig . 2, Fig .  3) . 
These are enriched with groups of other clmracter properties  ( phc ) nctics , morphological similarities , contextual semantics . . . ) , all su'ongly relevant to one of tim three languages of nse--presently  , only with the core of the Chinese instanciation .

I ) and a second complementary view with more advanced lexical ch  , ' u ' acteristics ( Fig . 2, Fig .  3) . 
We willingly refer to J . W . lleisig's work\[7\] , which emphasizes the role of a corpus of predefined mnemonic labels attached  , one to one , to kanji and possibly to some subcharacter morphological components  . Such mnemonic m , -u-king will supplement the etymology , while enhancing the user's ~ dmaginative memory > > and strongly rehtying visual memory  . We also strongly invite the user to personalize his knowledge ba ~  , through adding his own mnemonics or imaginative productions  . 
2.2 Basic functionalities
The lexical base initially m ( xlelled provides a good coverage of character properties  \[3\] : using one view of the character base , the user may explore language-free morphology ( pictogram , stroke number , overall structural vignette , semantic radical , confusings in filarities . . . ) and universal semantics , on the other hand--m~d on the other view--an author can discover language-relevant morphological properties  ( phonetic component illits structural valency , homographs , position alw triants for compound characters , use in composition . . . ) , language-tied phonetics ( written and voiced pinyin and tone , homophones . . . ), h ' ulguage-related smautics . 
A very detailed set of structural vignettes ( simihu " in spirit to I lalper n's patterns\[6\] ) is proposed with a digital coding , and validated over some 1500 kanji in the llei sig progression . They may deeply improvele , ' u ' ner recall of the over ~ dl structure of a character  . We have lor instance , with file grey t int giving the position of the semantic key:brightrisings unteatiny Fig  4: l ( ramples of structural vignettes Such patterns may also be invoked by the user for the study of compoundohm actors to be derived from a given kanji  , when recalling some particul , ' u " structural model . 
2 . 3 Multiple prototyping development schenle The first prototype implemented the concept mdm < u  . l cl of the property base as a highly structured hypertext  , using llyper C , ' u'd on Macintosh . We considered this platformag ( ~tradeoff between a vahmble interaction management system  , and a temperate framework for expressing the object-oriented and reusable view of the base  . 
We then adopted a twofold development scheme , with both incremental prototyping illlly per Card , for surface multimodal data and fortile interlace fimctional layer of the application  , and parallel prototyping on different development platlk  ) nrts , to explore different structuring and searching methods for tile character base  . 
Three tracks were experimented to express character search modalities in more relincd interactive ways : first a Data Base Management System approach  , flmmgh I wo varianls: ( 1 ) ollject-oricnled modelling of tile base ( int OOl'S on a Xerox workstatio q )  ,   ( 2 ) are hltional scheme on a standard medium ( an Oracle encapsulation illy percard on the Macintosh  )  ;   ( 3 ) various sketches of a knowledge base were prototyped in F'ro log with a simplified user interface  .

FLI~XIBLE EXPORAT1ON
The prototype may here administer different users ( learners , did acticians ) with data protection , manage a standard static ch , ' u ' acter properly base , maintain session journ Ms and user profiles , tracing their work in the base . 
3 . 1 Multlcriterial search of Chlnese Characters There are two main access chemes to characters  . 
Direct designation is based on a simple selection of the charactericons Oil character boards  . The surface organization of filebase in character series or lessons matches here structural and pedagogical motivations initially expressed by a did actician  ( Fig .  5) . 
2 88   7bwards linguistic knowledge discovery assistants . . . G . ~ t fiotte & F . Tcheou Multicriterial search ( MCS ) allows the user , starting from a partial description of the character  , from tentatively diserimiuaut properties lie may recall  , to refine or focus h is request . Partially erroneous demand should benmuaged adequately by the system  ( while suggesting dcfault or alternate detenniuatious for dubious prol ~  ) sals , or suppressing irrelevant ones ) . 
The elements remembered or ew~k~by the learner are put forward in a criteria array orgimized in  3 lexical property subclitsses : l ~ teutial characteristics about thcsought character itself  , about its semantic key , and about its phonogr , ' unmeif it exists ( the phonetic marker component , very often structurally present ) . See Fig .  6 . 
The grid presents main discrimiuaut criteria ( left ) and secondary characteristics ( right )  . In the MCS of complex characters , we put some emphasis on using structural vignettes and positional morphology aspects  .

Results of the sc~wch are available as character icons  . 
' lheuser may collect some of them ti ~ r later study  . Direct observation of a chmracter , straight away , is possible too . 
3 . 2 Ewdutive surfaces truCtoration for the base , and flexible session planning facility In its surface design  , the standard main clmract crbase is originally segmented illlessons  , or collections , according toltei sig's view of a pedagogical progression for a methodical discovery of kanji  . 
On the I ) BMS driven prototypes , surface recontiguralion of the base is made possible  , using in turn Ixlth multicriterial search or direct character collecting  . 
It may allowd Macticians to express different views of the intrinsic property base  , to restructure oh ; tractor lessons for pedagogic ; flreasous , to elaborate alternate progression schemes ( involving for instance use frequency , series with a comnu ) n semantic key , series with a shared phonogrmn me , ctc ) . They archere enabled to propose new palettes of ' predcfined lessons ' with alternate discovery paradigms or mnem  ( mic systems related to various linguistic and cultural vicws  , on which learners may express preferences its w cll  . 
The learner himself may build and maintain one or several personal  ( sub ) bases , or collections : series of characters that he selects using coherent criteria  , which he plans to explore in future sessions , collections reflecting a personal thematic organisatitm of the discovery  , simple reservoirs of characters built by free picking or rational collecting  , through digressive or systematic navigation in the bitse  . The leluner might here express , discover , refine , some personal discovery ' customs ' according to a cognitive style  . 
Both types of users are thus allowed ( with appropriate access rights to such restructuriug resources  ) to enrich file collection of existing views on the property basE  , to edit and to reshape predcfiued lessons or collections into ' personal less on s '  . 
Along with instant feedback and regula reviewing of tile actual work  , the systenlhere has some in cc mivcs to more intention-driven  , sell'guided learner activity , through sllort-tern~session plmming and long -range curric nhmt self-organization  . Case by case spontaneous consultatiou of lexical information is of course still advised  . 
3.3 Observing user activity
In our view such a function is essential on the way  It1 inteq ) reting and rot ? lolling user activity . On one of the prototypes , the tracing resources provid cxla first basis to el~d  ~  ) rate llxiblc , analytic and synthetic feedback or witness functions for the user-discoverer interface  , to build up an infommlion pool about user I ) chaviour mid discovery smltegies . 
While extracting data from file sessions base , we may sketch synthetic session journals , synthetic views on each character ( or character property ) for a user or-I ~ lrall users . 
3.4 Parallel prototyping
The DBMS view and the MCS ( MultiCritcrial Search ) were prototyped on diflerent development plat forms  . 
a ) an Object Oriented prototyping ( LOOPS ) A COCOArcl case of the AAOCC project was rewritteniu a homogeneous Object-Oriented fi'mne h  ) raco ~ pusofal ? ) ut 100 characters . Results and pcrlonnances were quite encouraging , though on this small scale model . 
b ) a classical relational framework ( Oracle ) Wcalso adopttal , on another prototype ( CACAO-4) , an integrative scheme merging two functionally specialized environments : IlypcrCardfi  ) rmultimodal interactive Ii ' out-eud resources , and ml ( hacle kernel or mmlagiug the bases and the user queries  . We here aimed at exploring implementation paradigms for htrg cr scale character bases  . 
The system first configurates entities in an Oracle property base  , while extracting relevant data from the llyper Cardhypcr document fields  . At query time , arguments sent from the interface layer will generate SQL requests  . System response is displayed back to the user , who then collects characters for litter use , or directly picks upn~dedmultimedia data on the properties sought  . 
~lhough on a still small scale prototype , the relatioual DBMS scheme cased data security , coherence qualities , as well as some quautitative dev clopmeut aspects . 

Towards linguistic knowledge discovery assistants . . . G . Fafiotte & F . Tcheou 4 . EXPERTASSISTANCE TOCItARACTER
IDENTIFICATION 4 . 1 Expert System oriented schemes We prototyped a similar'scale model ' corpus into smidl knowledge bases  ( facts , structural aud other property rules ) , providing for deductive and explanatory fnuctious . 
Data-driven and goal-driven schemes were experimented in a small Expert Assistant for Character Identification  . 
We try to initiate more interactive multicritcrial searches  , while coupling very discriminant semantic characteristics  ( the meanings of the expected character , of its semantic or phonetic keys ) , less selective indexiug(stroke number , pinyin . . . ) , with a tentative iconic specification of structural properties  . 
When efficient criteria , are missing , wetbiuk such a visual structural recall to be helpful  , with or without strong spatial positioning and applied to subcomponents with semantic or phonetic key functions  , through a progressive opening or refinement of structural vignettes  . 
4.2 Cooperative search
Later the user should be able to express preferences regarding the prompting profile or the search strategies adopted by the Discovery Assistant  ( I ) A ) in cases of underspecified or possibly erroneous queries  . The DA could group results or hints , in order to prevent over-stepped talkative dialogues  . System explanation , if activated , could justify or illustrate side-hints with details  . 
In the Annex example , the user tries to recall ach ~ waeter , ~  .   ,   ,   , a morphological tree of which is shown below ( the semantic keys of the subcomponents being squared  ) --- but he actually knows very little of all this . 
~ z  ~ a ~ ut b
Fig 7: A morphological tree for the character ILLU MINATI ~ A first scenario  ( see the Annex ) exemplifies a cooperative dialogue with a beginner user whose spontaneous search strategy will favour visual structural characteristics  ( with no particular attention here to any phonetic unit in the churacter  )  . The I ) A repeatedly asks for any semantic recall of another compouent  ( a most diseriminant criterion )  , but the user decliues , lie is therefore asked and helped to visually refine the overall finally I : ~  . structure , sucessively , ~ then , In a second scenario , the user soon proposes ( at dialogue step 2 ) a component kmfe (  ~  )  , which he figures to be present--and which really belongs to the investigated character  . With the current kaujibase , adding this very discriminant element directly produces the unique final solution : to illuminate  . 
In a third scenario , the user erroneously recalls ( at step 2 ) the possible presence of the radical strengh ,  ( ~ ) , instead of the very similar knife radical . The system will first exhibit , an empty respond , which is correct here . But knowing about this misleading similarity ( a ' faux , ' mils'property ) , it then suggests chm~giug strength into knife . If the user acknowledges the proposal , the proper character to illuminate is reached right away  . 
5 . A PROSPECTIVE VIEW 5 . 1 Functional development methodology In the context of our prototyping effort  , we would like ideally to design the application with a threefold functional architecture : a highly interactive interface layer developed on an appropriate authoriug environment  , fortile surface multim ( xlal representation f the lcxicalo : owlege ,   , an object oriented DBMS to express the core of the structural knowledge  , to implement efficieutly heavy data searching and to structure and update the user history profiles midperson id bases  , a declarative or deductive progriunming environment or expert system generator  , in order to express both the strategy m ( xlels of a coached or error-compensatory multicritcrial character search  , and first elements towards typed behavioural profiles and users ' discovery strategies  . 
This could poss it ) ly lead to ' client-server'm ' chitectures with distributed logical resources in the way of ' whiteboard's chemes  \[8\]  . lit seems that the iut cropcrability expected from multiplatform developmeut cnviroucm cnts will further such luuctionally distribute design  . 
5 . 2 Cooperative adaptive accompanying interface To summarize  , we intend to develop the first draft of the exploration assistant  , owards free surface resUucturing by the lean der of his personal kuowledge base  , according to a thematic or methodologic : dviewhe lkdlows  , personal management---plauniug , monitoring and reviewing -- of sessions or iuquiry sequences  , synthetic or analytical follow up of the discovery  , working on a metaphor of the subbase b ciug explored  , with qualitative indicators on the actual navigation  , productiou ( according to user preferences ) of session journals , profile status , global cun ' iculum surveys , issuing of persoualized written , magnetic or audio documents , for remediation and iu-depth work . 
5 . 3 Towards integrated polymorphic or multiple-view
Lexical Knowledge Bases
Our system can be viewed as a facet of a broader ' environment for an encyclop : edic discovery ' with other m cx les of activity : sell-review  , semi-tutored lessons , where character thematic'collections ' would drive the discovery  . 
It would be desirable to be able to find , througb different views , in one and the same knowledge base , all the information that the II alper u JapaneseEnglish dictionary  \[7\] offers , with the words built from clmraeters , Japanese pronunciation , a sound the saun~s , the data of a large ' Chiuesc-usual language ' dictionary  , character etymology\[10\] , classical , usual calligrap by , a language-independent view of the hanzi/kanji , angmented with a progressive and comprehensive proposal of mnemonics in lteisig's style  \[7\]  , but culturally related to tile user's native or usual language  , the resources and mod:dities modelled in the AAOCC prototypes  , for accompanied hyperdocumental navigation , expert character identification , for the creation and updating of pe~onal subbases or thematic character collections  , among other features to appear .

We advocate the development tff system components loth elping authors to access the underlying liuguistic knowledge  , mnong others in l :' ei ~ on alor DBMT systems . 
Such Discovery Assistants ( DA ) slmuld certainly be highly cooperative , namely show sensible interactivity ( within multimodal hyperdocuments and object I ) BMS frameworks )  , provide some ways to tentatively adapt to users ' nmemouic and cognitive customs  , and preleral fly first be user-tunable : i . e . they could offer means for the users themselves to refine and express their prc li:rences in terms of search strategies  ( Slmnlaneous , elf-phmned or coached ) , their planning intentions for a working sequence , as well ~ ts means for an efficient follow up of their activity  . DAs should in our view rather first enhance Imth user's natural intelligence towards more refleclive interact it m  ( ules , and user's self-gui&mce aptitudes .
