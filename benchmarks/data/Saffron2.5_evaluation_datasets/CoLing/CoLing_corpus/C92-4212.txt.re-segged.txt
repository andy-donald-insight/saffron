Abstract
Collocation-based tagging and bracketing pro -graras have attained promising results  . Yet , they have not arrived at the stage where they could be used as pre-procezsors for fullfledged parsing  . Accuracy is still not high enough . 
To improve accuracy , it is necessary to investigate the points where statistical data is being misinterpreted  , leading to incorrect results . 
In this paper we investigate in accuracy which is injected when a preprocessor relies solely on collocations and blurs the distinction between two separate relations : thematic relations and sentential relations  . 
Thematic relations are word pairs , not necessarily adjacent , ( e . g . , adjourn a meeting ) that encode information at the concept level . Sen-tential relations , on the other hand , concern adjacent word pairs that form a noun group  . 
E . g . , preferred stock is a noun group that must be identified as such atttle syntactic level  . 
Blurring the difference between these two phenomena contributes to errors in tagging of pairs such as ez pressed concerns  , a verb-noun construct , as opposed to preferred stocks , an adjective-noun construct . Although both relations are manifested in the corpus as high mutual information collocations  , they possess difl'erent prot ) erties and they need to be sepa-raled . 
In our method , we distinguish between these two cases by asking additional questions of the corpus  . By definition , thematic relations take on filrther variations in the corpus  . Expressed concerns ( a thematic relation ) takes concerns expressed , expressing concerns , express his concerns ere . On the other hand , preferred stock ( a sentential relation ) does not take any such syntactic variations . 
We show how this method impacts preprocessing and parsing  , and we provide empirical results based on the analysis of an  80-million word corpus . I 2
Pre-Processing : The Greater
Picture
Sentences in a typical newspaper story include idioms  , ellipses , and ungrammatic constructs . Since authentic language defies text book grammar , we must rethink our basic pars-~This research was sponsored  ( in part ) by the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency ( DOD ) and other government agencies .

Hypothetically , parsing could be performed by one huge unification mechanism\[Kay  , 1985; Shieber , 1986; Tomita ,   1986\] which would process sentences at any level of complexity  . Such a mechanism would recieve its tokens in the form of words  , characters , or morphemes , negotiate all given constraints , and produce a full chart with all possible interpretations  . 
However , when tested on a real corpus , ( i . e . , Wall Street Journal ( WSJ ) news stories ) , this mechanism fares poorly . For one thing , a typical well-behaved 34-word sentence produces hundreds of candidate interpretations  . In effect the parsing burden is passed onto a postprocessor whose task is to select the appropriate parse tree within the entire forest  . 
For another , ill-behaved sentences - roughly one out of three WSJ sentence si problematic-yield no consistent interpretation whatsoever due to parsing failures  . 
To alleviate problems associated with rough edges in real text  , a new strategy has emerged , involving text preprocessing . A preprocessor , capitalizing on statistical data \[ Churchela L , 1989; Zernik and Jacobs , 1990; Dagan et al ,  1991\] , and customized to the corpus itself , could abstract idiosyncracies , highlight regularities , and , in general , feed digested text into the unification parser . 
What is Pre-Processing Up
Against ?
The Linguistic Phenomenon
Consider ( Figure 1) a WSJ ( August 19 ,  1987 ) paragraph processed by NLpc ( NL corpus pro~eessing ) \[ Zernikela L , 1991 J . Two types of linguistic constructs must be resolved by the preprocessor : 
Class A preferred/AJ stock/NN * comma * and expressed/V Beoneern/NN about How can a program determine that preferred stock is an adjective -noun  , while expressed concern is a verb-aoun construct ?
The Input
The scope of the preprocessing task is best illustrated by the input to the prc-processor shown in Figure  2  . 
This lexical analysis of the sentence is based on the Collins online dictionary  ( about 49 , 000 lexical entries extracted by NLpe ) plus morphology . Each word is associated with candi-dales part of speech  , and almost all words are ambiguous . The tagger's task is to resolve the ambiguity . 
For example , ambiguous words such as services , preferred , and expressed , should be tagged as noun ( nn ) , adjective ( aj ) , and verb ( vb ) , respectively . While some pairs ( e . g . , annual meeting ) can be resolved easily , other pairs At'l-ms DECOLING-92 , NANTES , 2328 AO~-r19921306 PROC . OFCOLING-92, NANTES , AUG .  2328, 1992

Part-Of-Speech Resolution
The program can bring to bear 3 types of clues : Local context : Consider the following  2 cases where local context donfinates : 1  . the preferred stock raised 2 . he expressed concern about The words the and he dictate that preferred and expressed are adjective and verb respec--tively  . This kind of inference , due to its local nature , is captured and propagated by tile preprocessor . 
Global context : Global-sentence on straints arc shown by the following two examples :  1  . and preferred stock sold yesterday 1Nns . . . 
2 . and expressed concern abou L ? .   . * period * In case 1, a main verb is found ( i . e . , was ) , and preferred is taken as art adjective ; in case 2 , a main verb is not found , and therefore z-pressed itself is taken as the main verb  . This kind of mn biguity requires fidl-fl edged unification  , and it is not bandied by the preprocessor . Fortunately , only a small percent of the cases ( in newspaper stories ) depend on global reading . 
Corpusbased preferelt ce : Corpus analysis ( WSJ , 80-million words ) provides word-association preference\[Beck with el at  . ,  1991\] collocation total vb-nnaj-nn preferred stock  2314   100 O expressed concern 318   1   99 The construct expressed concern , which appears 318 times in the corpus , is 99% a verb-noun construct ; on tile other hand , preferred stock , which appears in the corpus 2314 times , is 99% an adjective-norm construct .  3
Where Is The Evidence ?
The last item , however , is not directly available . Since the corpus is not a priori tagged , there is no direct evider Lcc regarding part-of -speech  . All we get from the corpus are numbers that indicate the mutual information score  ( MIS ) \[Churchelal . , 1991\] of collocations (9 . 9 and 8 . 7 , tbr preferred stock and expressed concern , respectively ) . It becomes necessary to infer the nature of the combination from indirect corpus ~ based statistics as shown by the rest of this paper  . 
3For expository psrposes we chose here two extreme  , clear cut cases ; other pairs ( e . g . , promised money ) are not totally biased towards one side or another  .

Inferring Syntax from

In this section we describe the method used for eliciting word-association preference from the corpus  . 
Initial Observation : Cooccurrence Entail s Sentential Relations The bazic intuition used invariably by all existing statistical taggers is stated as follows : Significant collocations  ( i . e . , high MIS ) predict syntactic word association . Since , for example , preferred stock is a significant collocation ( mis 9 . 9) , with all other clues assumed neutral , it will be marked as an integral noun group in the sentence  . 
However , is high misalways a good predictor ? Figure 3 provides mutual information scores for preferred , expressed , and closed right collocations . 
The first column ( preferred ) suggests misis a perfect predictor . A count in the corpus confirms that a predictor based on collocations is always correct  . A small sample of preferred collocations in context is given Figure  4  . Notice that in all eases , preferred is an adjective . 
Next Observation : Cooccurrence
Entails Thematic Relations
While column 1 ( preferred ) yields good syntactic associations , column 2 ( ezpressed ) and column 3 ( closed ) yield different conclusions . It turns out ( see Figure 4 ) that expressed collocations , even collocations with high mis , produce a bias towards false-positive groupings .   4 If these collocation do not signify word groupings  , what do they signify ? An observation of expressed right collocates reveals that the words surprise  , confidence , skepticism , optimism , disappointment , support , hope , doubt ,   4Word associations based on corpus do not dictate the nature of word groupings  ; they merely provide a predictor that is accounted for with other loca J-context clues  . 
worry , salisfaclion , etc . , are all thematic relations of express . 
Namely , a pair such as expressed is appoint-ment denotes an action-object relation which could come in many variants  . The last part of Figure 4 shows various combinations of express and its collocates  . 
Using Additional Evidence
In light of this observation , it is necessary to test in the corpus whether collocations are fixed or variable  . For a collocation word l-word 2 , if word l and word 2 combine in multiple ways , then word l-word2 is taken as a thematic relation ; otherwise it is taken as a fixed noun group . 
This test for ezpress ~ word is shown in Figure 5 . Each row provides the number of times each variant is found  . Variants for expressed concerns , for example , are concertiex pressed , express concern , ez presses concern , and express . 
ing concern . Not shown here is the count for split cooccurrence\[Smadja  ,  1991\] , i . e . , express its concern , concern was expressed . The last column sums up the result as a ratio ( variability ratio ) agains the original collocation . 
In conclusion , for 12 out of 15 of the checked collocations we found a reasonable degree of variability  . 
Making Statistics Operational
While the analysis in Figure 5 provides the motivation for using additional evidence  , we have two steps to take to make this evidence useful within an operational tagger  . 
Dealing with Small Numbers
Although the table in Figure 5 is adequate for expository purposes , in practice the different collected figures are spread over too many rubrics  , making the numbers susceptible to noise . 
To avoid this problem we shortcut the calculation above and collect all the cooccurrence of AcrEs DE  COLING-92  , NANTES , 2328 AO~r1992I308 PROC .

Instead of asking : " what are the individual varLants ? " weask " what is the total cooccurrence of the root pair ?"  . For expressed concerns we check the incidence of czpress-in~eresl  ( and of interest-express )  . 
As a result , we get the lump sum without summing up the individual numbers  . 
Incorporating Statistics in Tagging
Co-oecurence information regarding each pair of words is integrated  , as described in Section 2 . 3, with other local-context clues . Titus , the fact that statistics provide a strong preference can always be overidden by other factors  . 
they preferred stock ...
the expressed interest by shareholders was In both these cases the final call is dictated by syntactic markers in spite of strong statistical preference  . 
Conclusions
NLpc processes collocations by their category.
In this paper , we investigated specifically the Past Participle -Noun category  ( e . g . , preferred-stock , expressed-concerns , etc . ) . Other categories ( in particular Continuous Verb-Noun as ill driving cars vs  . operating systems ) are processed in a similar way , using slightly different evidence and thresholds .

Applicable cases : 400

Correct tagging : 3, 58
Evaluation
Out of 2031 tagging cases counted , the algorithm was called in 400 eemes .   1631 cases were not called since they did not involve collocations  ( or involved trivial collocation such as ez pressed some fears  . ) Out of 400 collocations the program avoided ruling in 23 cases due to insufficient data . Within the 377 tagged cases , 358 (94 . 9%) cases were correct , and 19 were incorrect .
