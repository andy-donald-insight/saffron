This paper deals with the treatment of Scope and , in particular , Negation in Rosetta , a Machine Translation : ~ ystem which translates between Dutch  , English and Spmfish ( Spanish only as a target language )  . It will be ~ u-gued ~ hat the SOV-versus SVO -character of a lan~guage has important consequences for its possibilities of reflecting scope through word order  . A description will be given of the problems that arise translating from one type of language  ( the SOV-language Dutch ) to the other ( the SVO o . lar ~ guages English and Spanish ) . The extent owt fich these problems can be solved will be out  ; lined . 
The paper has been divided into two main sections.
In section one the phenomena are described linguistio cally  , in section two a general idea is given of how these phenomena are dealt within Rosetta  . 
~ . Linguistic phenomena 1o : ~: Expression of Scope 3cope be axing element sea~l be divided into two classes  :   1  ) NEG , containing both the adverbs ni et ( Dutch ) / not ( English ) ~no C Spanish ) and quazltifiers with morphologically incorporated negation  , such as nicts(D . )/~ o , hi , g(n . )/nada(S . ) . 
2 ) NPs and adverbials containing a quantifier ( from now on Q-elements ) ' , likereelk inderen(D . ) / many chil-drea(E . ) / touchesnir ~ os($ . ), eenvis(D . )/ afish(E . )/  . npe~(s . ),, a~k(D . )/ o/ten(nO~m ,, chas~ee ~, ( S . ), in ~ o , , , ~ i ~ i ~ i m n C D . )/ in , omcca , es(S . ) / ~ nolg ~ o , casos(S . ), etc . 
The question I am concerned with is how the scope order of Q-elements and NEG can be determined  . In a Montague GraJnmar of the PTQ type , (1) would have two interpretations , one with Every man having wide scope midone with two women having wide scope/Montague  19~3/  , Dowry 1981/:(1) Every man loves two women . 
~ This paper condenses part of the content of the author's ~  , heai ~ , / Van Munster 1985/I extended with the results of furthere search . This research was partially sponsered by Nehem ( Nederiandse Herstructureringsmaatschapplj )  . 
X Inthinpaper 1 limit myself to Q-NPs ~ although a parallel can be drawn between Q-NPs and Q-Adverbials  ( in -" eluding Q~PPs )  . Furthermore only extensional contexts are taken into consideration  ; itensional contexts are ignored . 
However , the interpretation with Everymanl lavir Lg wide scope is far more natural  . Therefore , in actor- . 
dance with Jackendoff's principle ~/ Jackendoff 1972/~ I make the simplifying assumption that sur/ac ~ order in principle represents the most plausible sFope order of Q-  . element a a zld NEG in the following sense : " AQ /NEG element has scope over ~ heQ/NEG el~me~d  , on its right and is itself i uside the scope of the Q/NEG elements on its lefl "  . 
Stating ii ' om this principle implies that other impor~taut factors are not taken into consideration  , such as : o Intonation , which is not visible in a written teXto Therefore sentences are considered raider neutral stress and intonation  . 
Context . Currently Qnly isolated sentences ~ ce taken into consideration  . 
Essential for translation is that , even if we assume that ( 1 ) is ambiguous between two scope readings , these ~ l-tence in the target language will have this same amble guity as long as the Q-elements have the same surface order as in the source language  . ~ n'thermore , both sentences will have the same ' most plausible reading '?\]\[  . 2 SVO versus SOV Rosetta translates between two types of languages  , namely the SOV-type ( Dutch ) and the SVO otype ( Spanish and English )  . This SOV-versm~SVO o character has important consequences for the expres?sion of scope  . I claim that in both types of languages the position of NEG is as close to the lefthand side of the verb as possible : it only precedes possible Q ~ elements that are wlth in the scope of NEG/Van Munoster  1985/  . 
Consider the following scheme:
Dutch : SO-(O ) NEG-V
English/Spanish : SNEG-V0-(0)
In an SOV-language the verb ( in basic position ) is in sentence-final position , while in an SVO dangaage the verb is in second position  . Consequently , in a ~ a SVO . .
language only two elements ( one in subject po ~ ition and one in ' zhift -position ~  , i . e . the position to the left of the subject ) scan precede NEG ; the objects are to the right of NEG in basic position ? ~ LanSOV-language like Dutch  , however , the objects axe to the left of NEG in basic position  . In principle there is no restriction to the number of elements that can appear to the left of 

In genera \[ it can be said that , especially if the sentence express scope through word order than is an SVO-language  . 
This basic difference between Dutch and Span-ish /English can cause problems when translating from one type of language into the other  . Consider e . g .  (2) , where ( 2 ) a cannot be translated into ( 2 ) b since the relative order of NEG and the Q-NP is not the same :  ( 2 ) a Dekinderenatenreels noep jesnie top . 
' The-children-ate-many-sweeten . not'b The children didn * teat many sweets . 
~ u the : English sentence the object has to be topic a Uzedinur de ~* oget the correct scope relations :  ( 2 ) clvf any sweets the children didn'teat . 
) L2i Subdivision of Quantifiers l : argue that the following subdivision of NP a can be made : IA  ) Qo ) ~ Psoenuttive to scope , i . e . the surface order of Q-NPs mid NEG is crucial for the interpretation  . 
( Dutch : iem and (' every body ') , tenN (' aN') , reel N (' many N ') , alle N (' all N ') , tweeN (' two N ') ; English : many Ill ; meet ; Spanish : mue hos (' many ') , do sN (' two ~') , etc . ) . 
E . g .   ( 3 ) a does not mean the same as ( 3 ) b : ( 3 ) a Nietreelmensenhouden vanvis . 
~ Not-many-people-like-fish'b Veelmense shouden niet vanvis  . 
~ Many-people--llke ~ not-fish '
IS)Q . :, NPs not senst tlve to scope , i . e . the surface order of Q-NPs and NEG is not crucial to t the interpre ~  , a tion ; these NPs always have wide scope , irrespective of their position . ( e . g . sommige N('saline ') , most N , alguien (' someone ') , something , etc . ) Since these NPs do contain a quantifier , however , there is a strong preference for a surface order which reflects the scope  . Therefore , (4) b is a much more natural word order than (4) a , although both sentences have in fact the same meaning  . ( NB . For some speakers (4) a is even out ) . 
(4) a ) Nieman d gelo of tsommige opmer kingen.
~Nobody-believes-some-remaxks'b 3ommige opmerking engelo of tniem and . 
~ Some-remarks-believes-nobody'2 ) deflxdteiqPs ( e . g . Jan (' John') , her boek (' the book *) , the maay linguias , etc . ) . Surface order is irrelevant for scope -interpretation  . If in ( 4 ) a and ( 4 ) b2Another term would be * topicaliv . ation-posltion ' . However , thin term can cause confusion since in Rosetta dis-~inction is made between's cope-shift '  ( reated in this paper ; the sentence still ha ~ a neutral intonation ) , and ' topicaliza-tion ~ ( th0~sentence has a non-neutral intonation ; not the surface order but the original position of the topiealized Q-elemet tt reflects the scope  . Both types of shift go to a M#-po ~' tfo ~ Scopeoshift is a transformation  , Topicalization rule . ( For these terms ave section 2 . 1) . 
, ommige is rephced by the de . red ~ ,   ( ~ ) ~ nd ( b ) not only have the same meaning but there is no difference in naturalness either  . Definite NPs have the feat . ~ e\[-q\] . 
1A and 1B together are the NPs traditionally called quantifiers  . I will indicate tile two types with resp . 
the features\[+S\]and\[-S\].
Note that the subdivision of Q-NPs is languages p e ? tide  , e . g . iem and in Dutch is scope-sensitive , while the Spanish and English equivalents ( resp . alguien axial someone ) are not . 
Spanish and English seem to have much more \[- S\ ] ele~ments than Dutch does  , which , as I claim , relates to the fact that they are less suited to express cope through word order  ( see section 1 . 2) . 
1.4 Two approaches to scope
In TG-oriented theories a distinction is often made be-  . 
tween differentypes of negation : S~negation and V ? ~ negation  ( e . g . /Jackendoff 1972/,/Las~ik19'n/,a . o . L with the speciM addition of TVP-and Vonegation for Dutch  ( e . g . /Hoekstra 1985/) s . To illustrate briefly what is meant by the differentypes of ' negation ~ let me give an example of each :  ( 5 ) a Janheeft geen boek gelezen . 
' John - - has-no-book-read ' ( S-negation ) bNietreelmenses , hebbeneen boek geleze ~?' Not-many-people-have -a-book-read '  ( S-negation ) cIemand heeftniet gere is d . 
' Somebody-has-not-travelled ' ( VP~negation ) dVeelmenses hebbengeen boek gelezen . 
' Many-people--have-no-bok-rcad ' ( TVP-negation ) e Janheef tveel mens enletsniet vertel d . ~' John-has-many-people-something-not-told ' ( V-negation ) It is assumed that the constituent so the right of  1NEG   , including the verb , are within the scope of NEG . In ( a ) NEG follows the subject , but since Jan is definite , S-negation is equivalent to VP-negation : as a general rule the position of NEG is after a definite  ( unless the sentence is e ontrastive )  . Both ( a ) and ( b) , however , cart be paraphrased by ' it is not the case that . . . ' which is a proof of S-negatlon/Jackendoff 1972/  . In ( c ) NEG has scope over the VP containing an intransitive verb  , in ( d ) over the VP containing a transitive verb plus direct object and in  ( e ) merely over the transitive verb . 
In logical terms , however , these sentences merely di I-fer in the relative scope order of NEG and Qoelement ~ t  ( i . e . of scope operators ) . Illa semantic , Montagueo like theory a verb ( unless it is a modal ) is not a scope SF or a treatment of ~ cope -ambiguity in TG of rame work see/May  1977/  .

2.2' I Yans latlng Scope
Now , there may be various reasons why the right-left substitution order causes problems  , both within one language and in translating from one language to another  , in the subsections 1 and 2 the problems will be sketched , in 3 a general strategy for a solution in
Rosetta will be given.
2.2.1 Switch of arguments
Problems within one language arise if the arguments have be ~ n switched with respect to the order of the verb patteru  ( i . e . the argument structure of the verb ) , in order to express the correct scope relations in the sentence  . Consider e . g . (9): (9) Veelboeken leestiedereen . 
' Mmly-boks-reads-everybody '
Recall that in analysis the Q-arguments are substituted from left to right  ( cf . section 2 . 2), i . e . reelboeken (= x2) before ieder een(=xl ) . Now , the output of the generative rules is as follows :
Rst ~ trt : xlx2lezen
R subst,xl : ( blocked)
Rsubst , : rl has to apply first but is blocked since there is a free VAR  ( x2 ) to the right . 
This type of switch also occurs in translating from one languag v into the other  , namely if the verb in the TL has a different order of arguments than the verb in the SL  . Consider e . g . the following verb patterns :
Sp~aish:xldar x2 x3
Dutch : xlx3x2 geven
Again a ~ suming that surface-order reflect scope order  ,   ( 10 ) aaud ( 10 ) b are not a correct translation of each other : ( 10 ) a Jange eftie de reen boek . 
' John-gives-everybody-a ( = ' some ' ) - book ' bJu and a unlibroato do elmun do . 
' John-glves-a ( ' certaln ' ) - book-to-e very body ' The order of Q-NPs in the Spanish sentence has to be a witr ~_mm chaw ~ SNEG is introduced syncategorematically  , l though it could have been a basic expression as well  . 
2.2.2 SOV/SVO problems
If a sentence containing a NEG-element has to be translated from an SOV-language  ( like Dutch ) into an SVO-language ( like English/Spanish ) problems may arise . Recall that the position of NEG is closely related to the position of the verb  ( cf . scheme in section 2) . 
In principle no problems arise if NEG does not follow a Q-object in Dutch  .   ( ll ) a and ( 12 ) a can simply be translated into ( ll ) b and ( f2 ) b respectively : ( 11 ) a Nietie dereenkomt . 
bNote very body comes.
(12) a Veelmen senkrij gengeen kado.
bM any people don't get a present.
However , as I explained in section 1 . 2 , in Dutch ( an SOV-language ) , NEG may occur to the right of a non-topicalized Q -object  , as in (13): (13) Wijsteldenveel vragenni et . 

The corresponding syntactic derivation tree is as follows  ( since the Dutch and English trees are isomorphic , I only give the English or target one ):/
R subst,xl/\
R subst , x2 We/\
Rnegman yquest ? ons /
R start/I\ask xlx2
Schematically , the output of the rules is:

R start : xl x2 stellen 1L~eg : xl x2 niets tellen R subst , x2:xlveelvragenni etstellen Rsubst , xl : Wijveel vragenni etstellen

R start : x lask x 2
P .. neg:(blocked)
Since x2 is to the right of the verb ( and thus of the NEG-position )  , Rneg is blocked . Note that this blocking is justified : without blocking the result of applying the English rules would be  ( 14 )  , which is not a correct translation of ( 13 ) :  ( 14 ) We didn't ask many questions . 
In other words , the wrong output is blocked but how can a correct translation be obtained ? In \] Io set ta two types of VAR ~ are distinguished  , namely \[+ Q\] and f-Q\] . Later on a Substitution rule can only substitute a\[+Q\]NP for a\[+QIVAR and af--Q\]NP for a \[- QI  VAR'9 The following general strategy is followed : Ira the Mffft-transformations  , where VARs are shifted , \[+ Q\]VARs are shifted to shift-position under certain condltions  , x ? Since there is only one shift-position , only one VAR can be shifted at a time . These transformations precede the substitution -rules  . 
The shift-transformations can be subdivided into two 
Ca , ses:1 . AVAR is shifted over a \[+ Q\]VAR . 
For (9) , ( in which both arguments are \[ q-q\]) , this means that the shift-transformations render two surface orders of VARa :  ( pathi ) xlx2lezen ( path ii ) shift/x2 xllezen Later on , in the Substitution rules , only ( ii ) offers the correct input for a succesful application of Substitution rules  , since VAR1 has to be substituted first ( right-left generation )  . This type of shift is only meant to get the correct scope relations in a sentence  , both when translating Dutch-Dutch and Dutch-Engl ish / Spanish  ( see also note 2 )  . 
2 . AVAR . is shifted over af-Q\]VAR , under one of the following conditions : a . There are two \[+ Q\]VARs in the VP . The left one can shift over the f-Q\]NP ( subject )  . 
b . There is one \[+ Q\]VAR in the VP ; a negation-rule has to follow . 
Although the conditions for both Dutch and Span -ish/English are the same  , the motivation for the shift over af-Q\]NP in both types of languages  ( i . e . SOV vs . SVO ) is different : For SVO-languages this shift is necessary in order to put a\[+Q\]argument in a position to the left of NEG  , i . e . to get the correct scope relations . 
Consider again the output of the English rules for  ( 13 )   ( V =' to ask ' ) :
Rule Output
R start : xlV x2
T shift : ( i ) xlV x2(ii ) shift/x2xlV
Rneg : ( i ) ( blocked ) ( ii ) shift/x2 xl not V
Rsu , x2: ( ii ) many(IS xl not V
Rsu , xl : ( ii ) many qs we not-V ( Final result : - Mazly questions we did no task ) oThis is the theoretical pproach . In order to avoid many wrong paths in the derivation process  , the implementation iB slightly different : it is possible to extract information about the substituent from the derivation tree and assign the correct Q-value to the VAR  , before the generative rules apply . 
1?The shift-transformations also shift WH-elements andI relatives  . 

For Dutch , being an SOV qanguage , this type of shift is not necessary for scope , since all Q-NPs can precede NEG without shift ( see section 1 . 2) . However , this type of shift should be done anyway in order to generate both  ( 15 ) a and ( 15 ) basparaphrases of each other : ( 15 ) a Jangeef treelk in dere neens no epje . 
' Jolm-gives-many-children-a-sweet'b Veel kiuderengeeft Janeens no epje  . 
' Many-chilclren-gives-John-a-swet ' ( 16 ) a and ( 16 ) bare also paraphrases of each other , but (17) a and ( l ~) b are not , considering condition 2 bTM ( 16 ) a Janheeftveelboekenni et gelezen . 
' Jotm-has-many-books-not-read'b Veelboeken heeft Janulet gelezen  . 
' Many-boks-has-Jolm-not-read ' ( 17 ) a Janheeftveelboekengelezen . 
' Jolm-has-many-books-read'b Veelboeken heeft Jangelezen  . 
' Many-books-has-John-read'2 . 2  . 4 Loosening conditions As I explained earlier ( sect . ioni . 3) , in the SOV-language Dutch it is easier to express scope through word order than in English and Spanish  , especially if the sentence contains a negation . In this section I will explain how the conditions  ( a ) and ( b )  , stated in secotion 2 . 1 can be loosened in order to be able to translate a Dutch sentence with more than two VARs to the left of NEG into Spanlsh/Euglish  . 
In general it can be stated that Rneg and Rsubst can apply freely even if there is a free VA  . R . to the right , if this VAR is \[- S\] . Now there are two possibilities : - The VAI ~ is definite  . The rules apply without restrictions , x2-The VAR is a \[- SIQ-VAR . In this case the surface order which rejects scope order is pre/erred  ( of .  (4)) . 
Now , this preference will be handled in Rosettaby means of a socalled bonus system  . Every output of a rule has a bonus 0 . Application of a rule can change this value . If there is more than one output , the bonus merely determines the order in which the output sentences appear  . 
XX The reason behind these facts is that only an NP that is not the focus  , can topicalize without changing the meaning ( or the theme/rheme relations ~/ Suffer 1982/ ) of the sentence . However , since a theory about focus is not available yet in Rosetta  , this is a way of either avoiding or making certain paraphrases of a sentence  . In fact ,   ( 17 ) b is a correct paraphrase of ( 17 ain case vee/bo~ke ~ is not focus , but not in all cases . In short , under the conditions given only a paraphrase is given if the topicalized argument has to be a non -focus element  , namely in case the negation is the focus ( (16 ) bas paraphrase of ( 16 ) a ) and in case another argument as the one topicalized is focus  ( (15 ) bas paraphrase of ( l  ~ ) a )  . 
x 2R-L gsnsration in case of deflnite a is merely done for efficiency  , in order to avoid unwanted ambiguities . 
Let me illustrate this process with an example . Consider ( 181 and its Spanish derivation ( V =' entender ' ) :  ( 18 ) \] k begrij piem and hist . 
' I-understand-somebody-not '
Output01xl
Rulebonus
R start : Vx 20
T ~ hift : ( i ) xlV x20 ( ii ) sh/x2 xl " V 0
Rneg : ( i ) xl no Vx2-1 ( ii ) sh/x2 xl no V 0
Rsu , x2: ( i ) xlno Valg . -1 ( ii ) alg . xl no V 0
Rsu,xI : ( i ) yo no ~ d " alg . -1 ( ii ) alg . yo no V 0 Application of Rneg with a free\[-SlVAR to the right lowers the bonus with one  . Consequently ~ the order of output ~ cntences is :   ( I ) A alguienno entiendo . ( output o/pathi0(2) No entiendo a alguien , zs ( output of path 0 Furthermore , if the Dutch sentence has more than two \[+ S\] VARs to the left of NEG  , It entatively propose to deviate from the conditions in the following way : - Application of R neg with a free\[+S\]VAR to the right lowers the bonus with  2  . 
-Application of Rsubst . ~ with a free\[+S\]VAR to the right lowers the bonus with  3  . 
In other words , a deviation in the order of NEG-\[+S\]/\[+S\]-NEG is preferred to a deviation in the order of \[+ S \]- elements mutually  .

3 Conclusions
In this paper I showed how in Rosetta translation probolems with respecto scope can be solved to a certain extent by means of shift -transformations  . Since a solu . .
tion is not ' always possible if we want to strictly main ~ rain the surface order of Q -elements  ( and since on the other hand sentences are ambiguous anyway  , particularly in SVO-languages like English and Spanish  )  , rule ~ which break scope-order prescriptions apply anyway but assigual ower bonus  . This bonus has influence on the output order of sentences  .
