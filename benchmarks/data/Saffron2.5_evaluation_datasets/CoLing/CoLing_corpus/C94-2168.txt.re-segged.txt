1. Aims of the project
The general aim of our project is to improve the quality of existing systems extracting knowledge from texts by introducing refined lexical semantics data  . The conlribution of lexical ~ mantics to knowledg extraction is not new and has already been demonstrated in a few systems  . Our more precise aims are to :- propose and show feasability of more radical semantic classifications which facilitate lexical descriptions by factoring out as much information as possible  , enhancing reusability of linguistic ressources . We show how the different linguistic ressources can be org ~ mized and how they interact  , -investigate different levels of granularity in the semantic descriptions and their impact on the quality of the extracted knowledge  . In our system , granularity is considered at two levels : ( 1 ) linguistic : linguistic knowledge representations may be more or less precise  ,   ( 2 ) functional : most modules of our system can work independently and thus can be used ~ pamtely  , -evaluate different algorithms for extracting knowledge  , taking into account efficiency aspects , -evaluate the costs of extending our system to larger sets of texts antito differeut application domains  . 
Our prqiect is applied to research projects descriptions  ( noted hereafter as RPD ) where the annual work of researchers at the DER of EDF  ( Direction des Etu deset des Rech crches , Electric it 6 de France ) is described in terms of research actions . The extracted knowledge must be sufficiently accurate to allow for the realization of the following Imrposes :  ( 1 ) evaluation of the importance of the use of techniques  , procedures antie quipments ,   ( 2 ) automatic distribution of documents in different services  , (3) interrogation , e . g . who does what anti what kind of results are available  ,   ( 4 ) identification of relations of various types between projects  ,   ( 5 ) construction of synthesis of research activities on precise topics  , and (6) creation of the ' history ' of a project . 
About 2 . 000 RPD are produced each year , each of about 200 words hmg . The total vocabulary is about 50 . 000 different words . Texts include fairly complex linguistic constructs  . We also use the EDF thesaurus ( encoding for nouns : taxonomies , associative relations , and synonyms , in a broad sense ) . 
In this document , we first introduce the linguistic organization of our project  , present the general form of texts and identify the type of information which mnst be extracted out of them  . Next , we present a semantic representation for the extracted knowlexlge  , and study in more depth the extraction of information under the form of predicate-argument and predicate-modifier stuctures  ( Jackendoff 87 a , Ka ~ and Fodor 63) . 
2 . The overall organization of the linguist ic system Letus first introduce the way linguistic knowledge is organized  . Due to space limitation , we just outline the main elements of the system , tiere are the different linguistic omponents of our system : surface forms : detemfines basic syntactic Thematic Roles  :1 ~ ~+ selec , restrictions l fead-form ~ and prepositions

Fig . t The Generall , inguistic Organizalion Thematic roles ( Dowty 89) ,   ( Dowty 91 ) paired with selectional restrictions and semantic information allow for the production or recognition of surface forms corresponding to ' b  , 'k sie ' sentential forms . More complex forms will be treated by a system of alternations  , derived from the semantic lassification of verbs defined by  ( l , ev in 93) . 
In our approach , we consider a set of primitive elements , either general or related to our application domain  , which includes notion such as being in contact with  , being in spatial motion , or being the cause of . 
This set of primitives is designed so that it corresponds to those needed for the definition of the semantic lasses of verbs  , where the syntactic behavior of a verb ( and thus the different ways the , arguments can be distributed and should be analysed by the parser and put at the right place in the semantic representation  ) essentially depends on the verb'semantic nature . This approach allows for a really comprehensive tratment of predicate-argument structures because it complement she basic syntactic mappings realized from thematic roles specifications  . Furthermore , this approach requires very economical lexical means  10  . ' 39 since it removes a lot of idiosyncracies previously encoded in lexical entries  . 
We are reformulating B . Levin's work for a subset of verbs of French . Although our study is quite general , we focus primarily on verbs found in applications  . Verbs of a given class have almost identical thematic distributions which are predictable from their semantics  . For each of the semantic lasses we have considered  , we have defined a relatively small set of thematic grids  , which define the ' regular ' thematic distributions  . 
From a different perspective , we also consider that a subset of the semantic primitives we have identified are those used in the LCS  , which we use in a slightly simplified way , since we do not consider for our application its deepest refinements  . The efficient use of LCS for practical applications has been shown in a number of works  , including ( Dorr 93) . 
3. Semantic typology of the RPD texts
Let us first illustrate the type of text we are dealing with  . Here is a standard text : " Los mesures destructives  ( ou as similables ) posent toujours desprobl ~ mesconcer nantle faible nombrede  donn6es disponible souencore leur cootquis'associe gan6ralement ~lanacessitad'une bonnepracision .

" 3 . 1 General organization of texts A global study of these texts shows a great regularity in their overall organization  . We have identified four major facets in most texts  , called articulations . These articulations are not necessarily present altogether in a text  . We have the following articulations :- THEME , which characterizes the main purpose of the text . This articulation includes the topic of the text , and the domain on which engineers are investigating  , -MOTIVATIONS , which relate the main objectives , the needs , the goals and which explains the development of the current project  . 
-PROBLEMS , which correspond to the difficulties related to the current state of the artor to the limitations of certain equipments or methods  . 
-REALIZATIONS , which describe the different asks required for the achievement of the project  . 
Articulations may cover one or more fragments of a sentence  , a whole sentence or a set of sentences . They do not necessarily appear in the order they have been defined here  . The decomposition of texts in articulations defines the pragmatic level  . We view the articulations as defining semantic fields  . The above text can be decomposed as follows :\[ t heme lies mosuros destructives \]\]  , \[ motivation ,   , \[ optimis or los campagnes demesure pour mieux analyserles incertitudes demesure  , et , I or squece laest possible , reduireles coots in duits . \] \] , \[ problems\[\[posent toujours des problemes concernantle fatble hombre de donn ~ es disponible souencore leur cootquis'associe generalement ~  . lane cess it~d'une bonneprecision \] , \[ probl ~ messent d ' autant plus difficiles gt traiter queles param~tresenjeu ont des comportements non-lin ~ aires  . \] \] , \[ realizations\[~tudierlesm~thodes permettant deprend reen compte cette non-lin ~arit~  . \]\]\] . 
For this level , we have implemented a method which permits the identification of the different articulations of a text  . This problem is divided into two subproblems : ( 1 ) identification of the articulations , and ( 2 ) extraction of relevant sentence fragments from the original text  . 
A study of the RPD texts has shown that these four articulations can relatively easily be identified by means of specific terms or constructions  . Let us call these terms or constructions articulation triggers  . Articulation triggers belong to different linguistic domains :  ( 1 ) lexical , where triggers are just words , e . g . ' devoted to ' , ' in the context of ' , ' propose ' , for THEME , (2) grammatical , where triggers can be phrases , or related to grammatical information ( such as tense and aspect , e . g . ' in the past years ' , ' since 198 9' , for THEME ) , or verbs or nouns of certain semantic lass , e . g . verbs of volition , of creation ( Levin 93) , (3) discursive , where triggers are mainly propositional connectors such as ' therefore '  , ' because ' , etc . , (4) pragmatic , where the relative positions of sentences and more generally  , the physical form of texts ( e . g . 
enumerations ) can determine articulations.
The next stage is to extract those portions of text which are relevant for the articulation considered  . Since the linguistic treatements of this first level are necessarily superficial  , we must carefully discard irrelevant portions of texts  . This approach has been modelled by means of extraction rules  , which specify words and constructions to skip and which delimit zones of texts to be extracted  . Evaluation of results is given in fig . 2 in the annex . 
3 . 2 Identification of knowledge to be extracted Let us now concentrate on the nature of the semantic information which should be extracted by the system  . We have identified three types of information : - general nominal terms  ( e . g . ' methods ' , data ') , and specific nominal terms belonging to technical domains  , -states or actions in which these terms are involved  , -general roles played by these terms in actions or states  . 
Roughly speaking , the first class identifies arguments , the second class defines predicates , while the third one introduces the notion of semantic roles such as thematic roles  . This latter level is of a crucial importance in knowledg extraction because it avoids making incorrect interpretations on the role of an argument with respect otheaction or slate being described  . This level is called the linguistic level . 
The level of granularity we are considering in this project suggests t  , stogroup predicates with a close predicate name , viewed as a primitive term . For example , we have terms which express the notion of definition  ( e . g . define , specify , describe , identify , qualify , represent ) or the notion of building ( e . g . assemble , build , compile , develop , for ge ) as defined in B . Leviu's work . Howcver , for a relatively small number of classes , in particular for those classes of predicates which denote complex actions and for those which exhibit a high degrcc of incorporation  ( Baker 88 )  , where incorporated knowledge needs to be made more explicit  , it may be necessary to use a more conceptual type of representation  . We want to investigate the use the Lexical Conccptual Structures  ( LCS )   ( Jackendoff 87 ,  90 ) whicl n match very well with the planned uses of the extracted knowledge on the one hand  , and with the notion of thematic roles on the other hand  . Let us call it the conceptual level . This paper being mainly devoted to the linguistic levcl  , this level will not be investigated here . 
4 . The linguistic level 4 . 1 Identification of predicative terms Predicative terms characterize states or actions  . The goal at this stage is to be able to determine in a way which is as systematic as possible which terms are predicative in the RPD texts  . A priori , verbs denoting states or actions and prepositions are considered to be predicative terms  . 
Nouns are slightly more difficult to treat . The EDF dictionary includes the specification of nouns derived from verbs  . We consider that these nouns are predicative . 
A few nouns , not derived from verbs are also predicative , such as algorithm , sort or departure , these are identified so far by hand . They may be later semantically classified as describing  , for example , actions or evenls . 
4 . 2 Identi f icat ion of re levant predicates and arguments in texts The second aspect of the linguistic level is the identification of predicates and related argmnents which arc sufficiently relevant to be extracted  . Relevance can be defined a priori and once for all or may depend on the text  . The relevance of a term can be defined according to several criteria :  ( 1 ) genericity , terms defining a research action , a realization , or a problem such as : define , improve , implement , test , evaluate and explore are of much interest . At this level , it is most useful to use B . 
Levin's verb classification to determine relevance . 
(2) specialization , corresponding to very precise terms describing a material  , an equipment , a method or a system . Specialized terms can be defined a priori from the thesaurus by extracting the most stx~cialized terms  . 
(3) local importance , where importance in a text is explicitly marked , for example , by a construction such as ' it is important to . . . ' or by a negation . 
4 . 3 Represent ing predicate a rguments and modifiers by means of thematic roles The relationship between a predicate and one of its arguments can be represented by a thematic role  . 
Thematic roles do confer a much stronger meaning to predicate structures  , in particular when then mtic roles have a relatively preci ~ meaning  . Thematic roles c~m be defined in a more refincd way than the usual definitions  . 
From that perspective , our claim is that thematic roles can form the basis of a good and stable general descriptive semantics of prc~licate-~u'gumentrlationships  . 
Thematic roles have then a conceptual dimension , and not only a linguistic one . However , they must not be confused with the conceptual a bels of the LCS  . 
Thematic roles must remain general ; they form a bridge between conceptual representations and syntax  . Fig . 3 shows the thematic roles we consider . 
We consider here an extended use of thematic roles since they are also assigned to predicate modifiers  , realized as prepositional phrases or as propositions  , in order to represent in a more explicit and uniform way essential arguments and modifiers  , since they all play an important role in the semantics of a proposition  . 
The general form of a semantic representation introduces two functions for thematic roles :  ( 1 ) an argument typing function : predicate_name (   . . . . ~ i :  argi .   .   .   . ) (2) a predicate moch fier typing function , where a prodicate is marked by a thematic role , if the modifier is a predicate : r_gJg_lj : predicate_name  (   . . . . r__0~l k : \[ arg k . .  .   .   ) The argiare fragments of texts ( NPs and PPs )  , which may be further analyzed in a similar way , if necessary . 
" or exanlple , a sentence such as:
John got injured by changing a wheel is represented by : injured h  (  . t . h . e . _m~:john)^causal theme:change(itg ~_nJ , : john , ~: wheel ) . 
If in an articulation , we only extract an NP , it is represented as an argument as fi ) llows : arg ( fragments of text corresponding to the NP )  . 
and uothematic role is assigned to it . The general representation fan articulation is tben :\ [ articulation_name  , \[ extracted text from pragmatic level \] , partial predicate-arge presen latkm\]The result of the parse of our sample text is given below  . 
\ [\ [ theme\[los mesures destructives ( ou as similables ) \] arg : mesures destructives \] , \[ motivations\[optimiser loscarn pagnes de mesure pour mieux connaitre  , voir eame liorer , los incertitudes demesure , et , I or squece laest possible , reduireles coots in duits . \] opdmi ~(_ , Incremental beneficiary theme : campagnes dexnesure  )  ^ ' ( g ~2: ( analyze (  _  , holistic theme : incerlitudes demes are ) ^ reduce ( __ , incremenlal victim theme : cof its ))\] , \[ prob!ems\[\[posent touj ours des problemes concernant lefaible hombre de donnees disponible souencore leur cootquis'associe generalement gtlanecess it ad'une bonne precision  . \]\[ problhmessent d ' autant plus difficiles ~ t traiter queles parametres en arg :  ( faible nombreded on nE~s , cofit , comportements non-lintaires )\] , \[ realizations \[6tudier los m6thodes permettant deprend reen comptecette nonqin6arite   . \] study (_, general theme : methods )\]\] . 
4 . 4 Parsing and assigning thematic roles Let us now show how our parser works and how thematic roles are concretely assigned to  , arguments . For that purpose , we introduce three main criteria : ( 1 ) the semantic lass of the predicative term where thematic grids are given  , (2) the semantic type of the preposition , if any , which introduces the argument , we also have defined thematic grids for prepositions  ,   ( 3 ) the general semantic type of the head noun of the argument NP  . Semantic types are mainly defined from the semantic fields given in the EDF thesaurus  . 
These criteria resummarized in fig . 4 at the end of this document . These criteria reimplemented by means of thematic role assignment rides  . 
The parsing of the RPD texts works independently on each fragment of text associated with each articulation  ( referencials pects will be considered later )  . We have the three following stages : ( 1 ) Identification of predicates and arguments : due to the complexity of texts  , a partial analysis is the only possible and efficient solution  . We have a grammar that identifies basic verbal constructions  , nominal constructions . The parser works bottom-up and identifies maximal structures which are not ambiguous  . 
(2 ) Thematic role assignement : The assignment procedure considers each thematic role in a thematic grid and searches for a nominal or propositional structure to which the thematic role can be assigned  . This assignment is based on the thematic role assignement rules  . The general form of a thematic role assignment rule is the following : assign_role  ( < name of role > , < grammatical form of predicate > , < grammatical form of argument > ) :-< unification or subsumption constraints on semantic features >  . 
This is illustrated as follows , where grammatical forms ( xp ) are given in Login form ( A'R-Kaqi and Nasr 86 )  , following the TFS approach : assign_role ( effective_agent , xp(syntax=>syn(cat => v) , semantics => sem(pred=>yes , relevance => yes)) , xp(syntax=>syn(cat => n) , semantics=>sem(pred=>no , sere_type=>tsem(semp=>X )))):-subsumed(X , \[ human , technical \]) . 
This process can be applied recursively on those arguments which contain predicates  . The depth of recursion is a parameter of the system  . 
(3) Semantic representation construction . At this level , deeper representations ( such as the LCS ) can be used . 
Conclusion
The novelty of our approach with respect to knowledge extraction can be summarized as follows :   ( 1 ) We have defined three levels of knowledge representation  ( pragmatic , linguistic and conceptual ) , which are homogeneous , expressed within a single , incremental formalism , incremental in the sense that knowledge extracted at an outer level is refine data deeper one  , and that representations support partial information  . 
(2 ) We have defined simple methods for extracting relevant tern ~ in texts  , using a thesaurus . 
(3 ) We show that the syntactic alternations given in Levin's work complement the basic syntactic forms generated from thematic roles  . These semantic lasses of verbs , because of their semautic basis and because of the way they are defined are a very powerful tool for assigning correctly thematic roles to predicate argument in a large number of syntactic forms  . 
(4 ) The different types of data and the level of granularity at which they are considered establishes linguistic levels of descriptions which correspond to a certain descriptive reality antito a certain autonomous and homogeneous level of semantic representation  .
