We present a constraint-based case flame lexicon arct fitecture fbrbi-directionM mapping between a syntacticase Dame and a semantic Dame  . The lexicon uses a semantic sense as the basic unit and employs a multi-tiered constraint structure for the resolution of syntactic information into the appropriate senses and/or idiomatic usage  . VMency changing transfbrmations such as morpt no log-ie ally marked passivized or causativized forms are handled viale:xical rules that manipulate case Dames templates  . The system has been implemented in a typed -feature system and applied to Turkish  . 
1 Int roduct ion - Recent adwmces in theoreticM and practical aspects of feature and constraint -based tbrmMisms for representing linguistic information have fos-tered research on the use of such formMisms in the design and implementation of computational lexicons  ( Briscoeelal . , 1993) . Case frame approach has been the representation of choice especially for languages with free constituent order  , explicit case marking of noun phrases and embedded clauses filling nominal syntactic roles  . The semantics of such syntactic role fillers are usually determined by their lexicM  , semantic and mor-plm syntactic properties , instead of position in the sentence . In this paper , we present an approach to building a constraint -based case Dame lexicon for use in natural language processing in Turkish  . 
A number of observations tha . t we have made on Turkish tmve indicated that we have to go beyond the traditional transitive and intransitive distinction  , and utilize a Dame work where verb valence is considered as the obligatory coexistence of an arbitrary subset of possible arguments along with the obligatory exclusion of certain others  , relative to a verb seuse . Additional morphosynt ~ ctic , lexical and semantic selectional constrMnts are utilized to map a given syntactic argument structure to a specific verb sense  . In recent years , there have been several studies on constrmnt -based lexicons  . 
iR , ussellelal .   ( 1993 ) propose an approach to multiple default inheritance t brunification-based lexicon  . In another study by Lascarides et el .  (1995) , an ordered approach to default unification is suggested  , de Paiva ( 1993 ) t brmalizes the system of well-for nmd typed features truetures  . In this study , type hierarchies and relations are mathematically defined  . They also formalize unification and generalization operators between t in  (  ; featm : estructures , along with defining wellformedness notion that we use in our system  . 
2 Representing Case Frame
Information
In rlhu'kish ,   ( and possibly in many other languages ) verbs often convey several meanings ( some totally unrelated ) when they are used with subjects , objects , oblique objects , adverb iM adjuncts , with certain lexical , morphological , and semantic features , and cooccurrence restrictions . 
In addition to the usual sensewu:iations due to selectional restrictions on verbal arguments  , in most cases , the meaning conveyed by a . case Danteisidiomatic , with subtle constrMnts . For example , the Turkisln verb ye(cat ) , when used with a direct object noun phrase whose head is:  1  . para ( money ) , with no case or possessive markings and almman subject  , means to accept bribe ,  2 . pare ( money ) , wittn a nonhuman subject , means to cost a lol ,  3 . para ( or any other NP whose head is ontologically ISA money  , e . g . , dolar , mark , etc . ) with obligatory accusative markilig ~ md optional possessive meriting  , means to spend * ~ IO~tCy ~ 4 . kafa ( head ) with obligatory accusative marking and no possessive marking  , means to get mentally deranged ,  5 . hak ( right ) with option Maccusative and possessive markings , mearls to be unfair , is ontologically ISA hnma . n ) with optional accusative mill optio , ali ) ossessivc marking ( obligatory only with ba , ~) , lile a 31 slow a steor demote , a person .

Figure 2: The portion of the constraint structure ibra portion of the the Turkish verb " ye "  . 
elude in the argument slot ( for a verb in active voice ) are the following : ? subject ( nominative NP )  , 1? direct object ( nominative or accusative ase-marked ~ IP )  , ? oblique objects ( ablative , dative , locative case-marked NP ) , ? beneficiary object ( dative case-marked ~ lP , or pP with a certain PFORN ) , ? instrument object ( instrumental case-marked gP or PP with a certain PFORIt  )  , ? value object ( dative case-marked NP or PP with a certain PFORH )  . 
In general , there may be more than one instantiation of the SEM frame for a given instantiated set of case frame arguments  ( and vice versa )  . For instance , for theye verb discussed above , the argument structure for the third case giving rise to the meaning to getmentally deranged may conceivably give rise to a literal meaning in a rather improbable context  ( such as eating the head of a fish at dinner- much in the spirit of the two interpretations of the English idiom kick the bucket  )  , or the same semantics may be expressed by a different surface form  . 
3.2 Constraint Arehlteeture
We express constraints on the arguments in the case frame of a verb via a  5-tier constraint hierarchy sharing constraints among the specification of other constraints and sense definitions  , whenever possible : NP's that have no case -marking in Turkish  . 
1 . Constraints on verb features that describe any relevant constraints on tile morphological features of the verb  , such as agreement or voice markers . 
2 . Constraints on mou ) hological features that describe any obligatory constraints on the arguments  , such as case-marking , verb form ( in the case of embedded clauses ) , etc . 
3 . Constraints on argument cooccurrence that express obligatory argument cooccurrence constraints along with constraints that indicate when certain arguments should not occur in order resolve a sense  . 
4 . Lexieal constraints that indicate any specific constraints on the heads of the arguments in order to convey a certain sense  , and usually constrain the stem of the head noun to be a certain lexical form  , or one of a small set ' of lexical forms . 
5 . Semantic Constraints that indicate semantic selectional restriction constraints that may resolved using a companion ontological database  ( again implemented in TFS ) in which we model the world by defining semantic categories  , uchashuman , thing , nonliving object , living object , etc . , along the lines described by Nagao et al (1985) . 
Figure 2 illustrates the simplified form of the constraint -sense mapping of the verb yc  ( e al )  . 
a . a Valeney Changing Transtbrmations As we have already stated  , we encode senses of verbs in active voice unless a verb has an idiomatic usage with obligatory passive  , causative and/or changing transformations , we dellne lexical rules as shown in Figure 3 .

This ligure describes how a given case fi'ame with its syntactic constituents is processed by a sequence of lexical rules each stripping off a certain voice marker and then attempting unification wii  ; ht ; he lexicon for any possible sense resoht tion .

SNM:ltOLES:/SOUIt'CE :

In inosteases , there are arguments that are not obligatorily required for resolving a verb sense  . 
These , nevertheless , have to be constrained , usually on semantic grounds . For instance the direct object is not obligatory for the basic sense of ye  , but has to be an edible entity if it , is present . 
We handle these constraints by defining a slightly more complex type hierarchy : argument = noun phrase I case-frame I optional  . 
optional = optional-edibleI optional-container I optional-instrument  .   .   .   . 
optional-edible = nilIedible-obj.
edible-obj ~ noun phrase & IS-A-EDIBLE.
where IS-A-EDIBLE is a constraint of the t'orrrt\[IIEAD:ISEM:edible\]  . The optional ablative and instrumental objects are defined similarly  .   4 The 4Note th ~ Lt the surface case constraints for these are defined in the ha  , sic definition of the case fl : ame . 
858 sense definition then becomes:
SENSE-EAT 1 :=
VERB-IS-YE & VERB-TAKES-NO-REFLEXIVE g
NO-DATIVE-OBL-OBJ
DIR-0BJ-IS ( optional-edible)
ABL-0BL-0BJ ( optional-container)
