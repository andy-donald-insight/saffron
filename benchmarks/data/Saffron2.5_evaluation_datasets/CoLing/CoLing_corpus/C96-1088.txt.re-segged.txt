Centering theory posits a discourse center , a distinguished discoursen-tity that is the topic of a discourse  . 
A simplified version of this theory is developed in a Dynamic Semantics framework  . Indm resulting system , the mechanism of center sh/ft allows a simple , elegant analysis of a variety of phenomena involving sloppy identity in ellipsis at ~ d " pay - check pronom ~ s "  . 
1 Introduction
Centering ( Grosz et al ,  1995 ) and Dynamic Semantics * both concern the sequential processing of discourses  , with particular emphasis on the resolution of pronouns  . In Dynamic Semantics , the semantic structure of a discourse gives rise to constraints on the resolution of anaphoric expressions  . Centering theory claims that a discourse always has a single topic  , or center . Constraints on the resolution of anaphoric expressions arise  , in part , from the ways in which the center can change in a discourse  . There is an important difference in the way discourses are viewed in Centering and in Dynamic Semantics  . In Dynamic Semantics , a discourse is viewed as a monotonic increase in information  , as discourse referents are constantly added to the domain of discourse  . Centering draws attention to a particula role that a discoursentity can hold  ; fl : om time to time , t , he current center will be shifted wit . hanew center . 
In this paper , I will implement a simplified version of the centering theory in a dynamic system  , and of phenomena involving sloppy identity in ellipsis and " pay check pronouns "  . 
Since Montague , a major goal of semantics has been to describe a compositional method for converting a syntactic representation fa sentence into a logical representation f the sentence meaning  , and dmn to evaluate that representation with respecto a given context  . A primary insight of dynamic semantics i that sentences have a systematic relation to context in two ways : not only are they evaluated with respect to the current context  , but they also systematically change that context . This insight has particula relevance \[' or the apparent puzzle presented by sloppy identity and related phenomena  . While anaphoric expressions are normally thought to be identical in meaning to dmirantecedents  , hey receive a different interpretation than their antecedents in these cases  . Given the dynamic perspective , the puzzle evaporates : the anaphoric expression and its antecedent might represent exactly the same meaning  , since mean-inn is fundamentally a potential to be evaluated with respect o some context  . What changes is tile context , in the discourse intervening between antecedent and anaphoric expression  . 
Consider the following example involving sloppy identity in VP ellipsis:  ( 1 ) Tom 1 loves his 1 cat . John 1 does too . 
\ [ loves his l cat \]
The sloppy reading results from a change in context  , in which the value of 1 becomes John rather than Tom . This allows an extremely simple account of the " recovery mechanism " involved in sloppy identity  ; the elided VP is exactly identical to its antecedent  . Several authors ( Garden % 1991; Hardt , 1 . 994 ) have suggested a dynamic account along these lines  , arguing that sloppy identity and related phenomena reflect there assignment of an index in tile discourse context  .   2 Alternative approaches postulate complex recovery mechanisms for sloppy identity  , such as higher-order matchiug ( Dalrymple et al ,  1991 ) or the syntactic matching of parallel dependencies  ( Fiengo and May ,  1994) . Below , I will argue that tile dynamic account is more general and empirically adequate  , as well as being simpler than alternative accotmts  . 
The clynamic account raises the following problem : since the index of the tile initial " controller " is reassioned  , it becomes in accessible in subse-center will always occupy another index as well as  0  . We . willus ( ; the * to designate references to the discourse ce . nter . Thus tim above examt ) le will be notated as follows: ( 2 )  ' . l . ' omj , loveshis , (: at . John 2, does too . 
\[ loveshis.cat\]
Intile first sente Ilce , To'm , is the value of ill-dex1 , and ix also the discourse center , i . e . , the value of index 0 . The pronoun his * is equivalent to his 0 , and dins refers to tile discourse center . 
In tile secon (1 sentence , John becomes the value of index 2 , and also replaces 5Ibm as the discourse center and thus John becomes the value of index  0  . 
This center shift gives rise to the sloppy reading . 
l lowever , both ' Ibm and John remain a ( ' eessible in subsequent discourse . 
The paper ix organized as follows : In Section Two  , i present a dynamic fl'amework based on the system described in  ( Muskens ,  1996) , with extensions for the discourse center , VP ellipsis , and t ) ayt : heckt ) ronouns . Section Three ( : one ernsan " expanded paradigm " for sloppy identity  ; it ; is shown that the t ) roposed approach uniformly accounts for a broad range of sloppy identity phenomena  , including some not previously examined in the literature  . Conclusions and plans for future .

2 A Dynamic Framework
The basic dynamic framework is the dynamic logic system of  ( Muskens ,  1996) . This framework has , for the sake of simplicity , restricted l ; he study of anaphorato pronouns that are extensionally identified with their antecedents :~  . I will extend Musk ( ms ' system to permit anaphora involving VP's as well as NP's  , and to allow antecedents to be dynamicms well as ordinary  ( extensional ) objects . 
In Muskens'system , linearized I ) RT boxes are integrated with the type logic ( Church , 1940) that underlies Montague Semantics . Linearize ( tDIT boxes are simply a more concise way of writing standard  DIt3 ~ boxes ( Kamp ,  1980) . Muskens shows that DR~I'b oxes cant ) eviewed as abbreviations for expressions in ordinary type logic  . Consider the following discourse . : tile ; discourse : Aj farmer walks . Hellaughed . 
This is represented by the following linearized
I ) RT box :\[ u:t\[farrner(ul) , walk(u1) , taugh ( u  ~ ) \]  3There are several researchers who have extended dynamic frameworks to account tbrellipsis and related phenomena :  ( Klein , 1984) is a nearly examt ) le . 
lAsher ,  1993 ) examines a variety of extensions to the I ) R  ~ . \[~ framework . ( van Eijek and Francez ,  1993 ) ex ~ plorc similar issues of indexing and ellipsis in ady~namic setting  . ( Gardent , 1 . 99 t ) also extends ady ~ namie semantic system for ellipsis and anaphora  . 
This is an abbrevial ; ionfordm following type logic formula : Aij ( i\[ut\]jA farmer ( uj ) A walks ( u : , j ) A laughs(u , j )) In the above formula , the variables i and j ret ) -resent in pul : and output st ; ates , and tim variabh ~ u ,   ( akin to a discourse marker ) is aflln ( : tion froln states to individuals , lit what , folk ) ws , we use the DltPF abbreviations without further comment  ,  . 
The reader is referred to ( Muskens ,  11996 ) for fur--there xaml ) les and the details of l ; tl(' , system . 
We now define a siinple fragment of English , base (1 on the one given in ( Muskens ,  1996) . 
-> P , . lotu , , , , : W(\[u , , , = hc , where it ~ At , q\[II'~q\]an(l ->; walk- . Sv\[I walk(v)\]:at-*Xv\[I cat(v)\]l ( , v , , Aq Not:e that the t;ransladon for h , e , , refers to dr(ant(lte , ~)) . T iff s is detined as the discourse re4> resentation of the antecedent of he ~ ( see ( Muskens ,  71 . 996, page 20)) . Thel ; ranslation for and is the sequencing operator ,  ; . As described in ( Musk ( ms ,  1996) , the sequencing of two boxes K , K ' is an abbreviation for the following type logic expression :\ [ K ~  ; g2\]l-~<i , j > I~k(<i , k > ~\ [ t ~' t ~& < k , j > e\[K2~) Typically , two DI/~ . \[' boxes appearing in sequence can be ' m , evged in Loa single box , consisting of the union of the discourse markers ill the two boxes and the union of the conditions  . This is described in the Mcwi'n9 Lcmma of ( Muskens ,  1996 , page 8) . In the representations that follow , we will often merge boxes without ( ; Oltli\[lell to sill l-plify representations . I lowever , the merge of two boxes is not always possible if there is a reas-sigmnent of an index  , i (; will not be possible to perform the merge . This will arise in the cases of sloppy identity exalnined below  . 
The above t\]'aginent , following the Kamp/lteim accounts , considers only one type of anaphora , involving individuals . We will extend the fragment in the following ways : ? we will add the idea of a di  . scour . secenter to the system ? we will allow dynamic properties to be added to contexts  , as antecedents for VP ellipsis ? we will allow dynamic individuals to be added to contexts  , to accoullt for " pay check proll Ollll S~W ( ' , de , film position 0 in Om context as t ; h ( ; I ) is-co'u , rse ( , ' cntc . r ' .

P2 = Ax\[u31 of ( u3 , Uo ) , cat(ua ) , love(x , u a )\] , of ( ua , uo) , cat(ua ) , love(u , ,ua )\] ; \ [ Uo'U4IU4=110'U4= John\] ; \[ UaIof(ua , uo ) , eat ( ua ) , love(ua , u3 ) \] The antecedent for the VPE is " love his cat " . 
This object ( PJ is introduced into the context by PRES > P2 represent she property of " loving u0's cat " , where uo is the discourse center defined in the input context  . In the first sentence , the center is TOM . The second sentence shifts the center to JOHN . It is this change in context hat gives rise to the sloppy reading  . Thus a sloppy reading is made possible when there is a center shift  . 
Finally , we allow the possibility that , a property might be the discourse center . This means we must add an alternative rule for INFL  , so that it adds a property that is the discourse CE nt Er :

APAx\[PnIP0-=-P,~,Pn=P\];P ( x)2 . 3 Paycheck Pronouns The phenomenon of " paycheck pronouns "  , 5 is illustrated by the following Example ( 6 ) Smith spen this pay check . Jones saved it . 
The reading of interest is where the pronoun " it " refers to Jones'pay check  , although its antecedent ( " his pay check " ) refers to Smith's pay-check . Our account for this parallels the account of sloppy identity in VP ellipsis  . The antecedent " hisipay check " introduces a dynamic individual : a relation between contexts that introduces i's pay check to the output context  , where the value of i is dEtErm in Ed by the input context  . The following rule makes it possible for NP's like " his pay check " to add dynamic individuals to the context  . 
his(he ~' Sm ) = >
P , Ixm = I of ( u .   . un)\] ; xm ( PJ 5This term comes from Kartunnen's example : The man who gave his pay check to his wife was wiser than the one who gave it to his mistress  . Various accounts of this phenomenon have been proposed  , such as ( Cooper , 1979; Engdahl , 1986; Jacobson , 1992; Gardent ,  1991) . ( Heim ,  1990 ) proposed extending the Sag/Williams account of VPE to the case of pay check pronouns  . Gardent makes a proposal similar to the current account : a dynamic approach in which pay-check pronouns and VPE are treated uniformly  . 
We use variables of the formui to denote ordinary extensional individuals  ; we use variables of the form xi to denote dynamic individuals  . There are two distinct effects on the output context  . 
First , the dynamic individual Xm is added to context : this object adds an individual Um to a given context  , such that Umis of unin that context . 
Second , Xm is applied to the property P2 . This actually adds u , ~ to the current context . 
Finally , we need an alternative form for pronouns thai ; refer to dynamic individuals : hen ~ 6 where 6 = dr ( ant ( he , ~ ) ) The pronoun hen recovers xn from the current context  . The desired reading can now be derived as follows  :   ( 7 ) a . Smith spen this pay check . Jones saved it . 
b . Smith1*PAST2 spendhis*pay checka.
Jones 4* PAST as aveit a.
We take the two sentences individually . The first sent EnCE introduces the dynamic individual x a  , as follows 6: his * pay check a . => AP2\[xaIxa=IP(\[u3\]of(ua , u0) , pay check(u3)\];
P ( ua ))\] ; xa ( P2 ) spend his * pay check >=> Av\[xaIx3=AP ( \[ ua\[of ( ua , uo ) , pay check(ua )\];

P ( ua ))\];\[113I of(ua , uo ) , pay Eheck ( ua ) , spend(ul , ua)\]
We continue with the second sentence.

AP(\[uaIof(ua , u0) , paycheck(ua)\] ; P ( ua ))\] We perform A reductions , resulting in : 6 To simplify the representation , we omit the values for VP variables P2 and Ps , since they are not relevant to the current example  .

3 An Expanded Paradigmt br
Sloppy Identity
The proposed theory permits a simple , llniforln treatment of sloppy identity in VPE and pay-check pronouns  . This uniformity extends fln'ther . 
We simply permit sloppy identity for any proform , whenever the anliece ( le . nl ; contains a preform within it . This is schematic Mlyre presented as follows : Cl .   .   . b , .   .   .   .  \ [ , , , \ ]  .   .   .  \ ]  .   .   . c2 .   .   . b , "\] ( C1 , C2: " controllers " of sloppy variable YP ) Ilere , XP is the anl ; ecedent for some preform XP ' , and YP is the sloppy variable ~ , i . e . , a proform embedded within XP . A sloppy reading re-suits whenever there is a center shift involving  C1 and C2  . That is , the interpretation of YP switches from controller  C1 to C2  . 
Since the dynamic theory treats VP ellipsis uniformly with NP proforms  , XP and YP both range over NP and VP . This predicts four possibilities . 
All four possibilities in fact occur , as shown by the following examples : ( 8 ) Tom\[v , ' loves IN , ' his\]cat\] . John does too . 
(9) Smith spent IN ;' IN , ' his\]pay check\].
aeries saw ; dit.
(10 ) I ' ll help you if you\[v*'want meto\[v*'\ ] \]  . I'llkiss you even if you don't , rr This example was provided by Marc Gawron(p . c . ), who attributed it to Carl Pollard . 
(11) When Harry drinks , I always conceal \ [ NP my belief that heshou ldn't\[vp\]\]  . When he gambles , i can't conceal it . 
Exa Inlfles ( 8 ) and ( 9 ) have already been discussed . (8) is the familiar (: as (' , in which the VP antecedent ( XP ) contains a sloppy pronoun ( YP )  . 
YI's witches from C1,~lbm , to C2, John . In example (9) , we have at , NI ' antecedent ( XP ) containing a sloppy pronoun ( YP )  , and the two controllers t brYI ) are Smith and Jones . l , ' , xample ( 10 ) involves a V Panteee ( lent ( ' ontaining a sloppy VP ellit ) s is ; l ; he VP ellipsis switches from help you tokiss you . Finally , example (1 . 1 . ) involves an NP atttece ( tent ( : ontaining as h ) ppy VP ellipsis , switching froIn drinks to gambles . 
We have already seen how the sloppy reading is derived for  ( St and for ( 9 )  . We now show the deriwttion tbr ( 10 )   ( example ( 11 ) can be derived in a similar fashion . ) 8:1~WILl ; 2* hell ) you a\[if \] you a PRES 4 wantntel 1 ; o2 .

Below , we substitute the value Av(\[I want(v , Po(th ))\]) for P ~ , and then substitute the wflue Av(\[\[help(v , u : 0\]) for P0 , and a pl ) ly it to u a , giving the following , result : It WILL 2* helt ) you a\[if \] you a PRES4 want me1 to 2 .

NOT(\[I want(ua , kiss(u , , ua ))\]),
It is the . " center shifl T involving P2 ( " help you " ) and P5 ( " kissyou " ) that in akes the desired reading possible . That , is , " whatuadoesn't want is for 111 tokissua " . 
The dynamic theory explains all four of these eases in the same way  ; the embedded proform in the antecedent ( : a nbe sloppy , because the controller for the embedded proform can undergo a center shift  . The eases illustrated by (10) and (11 . ) 8 We construct a represent at , ion as if the connectives if and even if were simple conjunctions  . This allows us to avoid the complex issues involved in representing such " backwards conditionals " in a dynamic system  . 
523 have not , to my knowledge , been discussed t ) revi-ously in the literature . It is not clear how such ex-amt ) les could be handled by alternative theories , such as ( Fiengo and May , 1994) or ( Dah'ymplel ; al . , 1991) , since these theor i (' , s do not treat NP and VP anaphora in a uniform fashion  . 
4 Conclusions and Future Work
The dynamic perspective provides a Kamework for a silnple  , intuitive account of sloppy identity and related phenomena  , by explaining the interpretive facts in terms of changes in context  . This requires contexts to change in a way that is somewhat foreign to the dynamic perspective  ; a given position in tile ( : on text must be reassigned , or shift its value . To implement this , I have incorporated the notion of discourse center  , together with theme (' hanism of center shift , into a dynamic sys-rein . This makes it possible to give a novel , dy-nalnie account of sloppyid ( mtity t ) he nomena , i have shown that this approach aee otmts for an expanded paradigm of sloppy identity  , going beyond tile data addressed in alternative a ( :counts . 
In future work , we will investigate in e or I ) orating additional aspects of centering theory , including the tbrward-looking centers list , and the prefer-en ( ; e orderings on transitions .
