i . Introduction
The study of text understanding and
knowleg de extraction has been actively done by many researchers  . The authors also studied a method of structured information extraction from texts without a global text analysis  . The method is available for a comparatively sbort text such as a patent claim clause and an abstract of a technical paper  . 
This paper describes tile outline of a method of knowledge extraction from a longer text which needs a global texanalysis  . The kinds of texts ~ e expository texts ~ ) or explanation texts -' . 
Expository texts described here mean those which have various hierarchical headings such as a title  , a heading of each section and sometimes an abstract  . 
In this de Ein Jtion , most of texts , including technical papers reports and newspapers  , are expository . Texts of this kind disclose the main knowledge in a topdown manner and show not only the location of an attribute value in a text but also sever n\ [ key points of the content  . This property of expository texts contrasts with that of novels and stories in which an unexpected development of the plot is preferred  . 
This paper pays attention to such characteristics of expository texts and describes a method of analyzing texts by referring to information contained in the intersentential relations and the headings of texts and then extracting requested knowledge such as a summary from texts in an efficient way  . 
2 . Analysis of intersententia \] relations Tile global sential analysis is performed by using the information contaJned in the intersentential relations and the headings of a text by a method combining both the bottom-up and the topdown manner  . Various kinds of intersentential relations \] \] ~ vebeen proposed so far by many linguists " --  . By referring to these proposals , intersentential relations are class \] lied tentatively into about  8 items . They area detail , an additional , a parallel , are phrase , an example , a temporal succession , a can sal and a reasoning relation as described in the following subsections  . 
Detail relations
If a term t 2 is the topic term Jn a sentence S 2 and i\[I : is a complementary term of the top Lc term t \] in the preceding sentence $ I as shown in Expr  . (1), S, . is called the detail of ~1"S ? ( PRE ~' p , K?t . , K , ~" t ~, K " t . ) \ ] " ' 1 l \ ] " = t I z " z r l " r l $5: ( PRED : p ~ , K ,   ,   , : t . , K ~: t ,   , )  ( I ) ZZZ\]~ZrzrZS " 3" "'''' ~''''" where K : t represents a pai rofa ease label and a term  , and the term w : it hadouble underline denotes a topic  . 
The sentence level of SI to that of S 2 depends on the property of the sentence S 3 following to S 2 and the relation among the terms contained in the sentences S  1 S 2 and S . . If the sentence S 3 is connected to S 1 more closely than $2  , for example , if the sentence S 3 has the topic term tl of the sentence S\] as the topic  , it is considered that the principal sentence is S and the sentence level of S~is lower than that of ~  . .
0 z " tn the other hand , if SI is an introductory sentence of a term t 2 and the articles related to t 2 are described in some sentences following to $ I , or I : if t ~ is the ~ , lobal topic of the section , the z sentence S is considered the principal sentence  . 
\]' he global 2 topic can be easily identified by inspecting the headings of the section the title and the like  , whatever it : is an attribute name or an attribute value without reading through the whole text  . 
If the term t2 in the sentence S . belongs to a kind of pronouns such as " in the following ones " or " as follows "  , the sentence SJs set at the same 2 level as that of $ I . At the summarization stage , the system tries to s ~ or ten the part consisting of S  1 and S ^ by replacing the pronount ~ in S . by the maingzI content given : in S2 , namely , the main part consisting of t . and p . 
\[ Example I\]r 22 ( a ) S\]:SGS receives an ordered triple from a user . 
$2: Tile triple's for miscategory , input-frames , conditions on the sentence . 
$3: SGS regards tile ordered triple as a goal.
SO describes ; the content of a term " ordered triplg " in S\] , and S~hastile topic term " SGS " in S Heine S is the ~ e-a\[l of S  , and S is thei: .   . '2"""\] 1"pr:lncl . pa ? sengence . 
( b)S\]:Inth:issection , the overview of LFG is described . 
$ 2: LFG is an extension of contextfree grammar an ( \] has the following two structures . 
$ 3: One is a c-structure which represents the surface word and phrase configurations  , and tile other is a f-structure . . . . . .
S\] is an introductory sentence of a term " LFG " which Js the global topic in a section taken from a text  . S has a kind of pronoun " tile following two 2 . " structures whose contents are described JnS3 . 
Hence , Sistile principal sentence and tile sentence 2 .   .   .   . level of S_ is the same as that of S^z "" As a sl  ) ecial case of detail relations , there are are phrase relation and an example relation  . These intersentent Jal relations between sentences St and S  2 can be identified by referring to their sentent : ial constructions and sentence modifying adverbs such as " in other words " and " for example "  . 
The principal sentence of them is , in most cases , the sentence S1 Jn an expository text . 
Additional relations
If the current sentence has the same sential topic t  . as that of the preceding \] . 
sentences and describes another attributes or called an additional sentence to the preceding sentences  . The sentential form of the relation is
S~:~(PRED:p ~, ? K.:t ., l = zKrl:tl)
S : ( PRED : p , K . : i . , K " ~ ( 2 ) 2 The level ~ of JbT ~ ht ~' t2 ) sentences S and S 9 are l generally assumed to be the same except-for the case that the global topic is put in a predicate part of them  . It can be also considered that additional relations hold among various sential groups of the same \]  . eve\] . such as chapters sections or paragraphs under a global topic contained in a title  . 
3 ? ~ Other sentent Jal relations
There are other intersentential relations . They are roughly classified into a serial and a concurrent or an extended parallel relation  . 
A serial relation such as a temporal succession a ca as alor a reasoning relation hastile same physical locatioa of focus or the same logical object while it has a time shift or a logical inference step shift between adjacent sentia \ ] groups  . 
A concurrent relation has the same t : i . meinstant of the event occurrences or the same stages of logical inference while Jt has a distance or a spatial positional shift hetween the physical ortile logical objects described in the adjacent sential groul  ) s . 
The level number of a sentence to the adjacent sentential groups in these relations is assigned ill a similar way to that of the detail or the additional relation by referring to the intersentential relations and the global topics  . 
In usual cases , the difference between a principal sentence level and the adjacent sentence level is usually set within one level  . 
As seen in the above , a sentence or a sentential group has an intersentential relation to some adjacent sentences or sentential groups  . The intersentential relation between adjacent sentences is s in lilar to a relation between adjacent words or word groups combined through rewriting rules of a sentence  . The intersentential relations are classified into two classes  . One of them Jsa relation such as a detail relation which holds between a principal sentence and the auxiliary or modifying sentent Jalgroup with a lower level than the principal sentence as shown : in Fig  . \] . ( a ) . The other is a juxtaposition relation like an additional relation which holds among several coherent sentences with the same level in usual as shown in

In these diagrams a leaf node represents a sentence of a text and an intermediate node denotes a representative sentence of the direcL descendents or the principal parts of them  . A namer attached to an arc bridging over several branches denotes an intersentential relation  . 

An expository text has a title and consists topics of the text  . The heading of each section shows local topics of each section and constitutes the attributes of the main top:ics  . 
Each of ma Jnsections sometimes has ~ lnint roductory remark followed by the main part  . The content of tile main part is almost covered with the subframe predetermined by ti le heading and the title  . 
The global cohesion of a section is assured by a relation Jn which each mai a part of the section shares some items of L he same subframe with other main parts  . 
Based on the above idea of text construction , a text anelys J . sJs ( lone after parsing of each sentence . First , each pronoun is replaced by the antecedent noun word with tile aids of an anaphora analysis  . The a , tile interlnediate express Jon of each sentence of the text is transformed into the normal form in which each topic term Js : inherJted together with a double under \] in edn lark  . The expressions to be norn la\]ized are object -apposition expressions ~ objec  . t-conlponent expressions predicate-cause express i  . on s , expressions which , have ~) a term consisting of a case label , and others . 
After normalization , the part of top : ics and the content of each sentence are first : identified ? Second  , intersententia \] relat Jons between two adjacent sentences are identified Jn determ Jrl is tJ cal-ly based on the assumptions of two classes of intersentential relations in ent Joned in section  2  . 
Third , tile ma:ia sentence is identified by refer ring to tile intersentential relations and the heading o\[the section undertile main topics of tile title  . The lower\]eve\]sentence : is indented as a modifier of the main sentence  . Sometimes , tile know \] . edge of the specific field : is required for better understanding of the relations among main sententia \] groups and various headings of the text  . A case : frame of a knowledge base for the specific field is provided in which each slot is filled with the most general term Jn the specific field  . Fourth , a subframe name is prefixed to each nlail \] sent_ential group by referring to the category of the main predicate term of tile main sentence and the subframe designated by the heading of the section and the title o f the text  . 
The basic subframe names are , for example , FUNCTION , COMPOSITION and PROPERTY in descript : ion of actions and physical objects  . 
As seen in the above , the main work of the text analysis is to: identify the main senl : entJal groups and to as s ign to the nlastaadard attribute name of a subirame in a specified field  . These frames and attribute names are used as a key of a specific field for efficJently storing and retrieving the knowledge contained in texts  . 
The next example of text analysis Js taken f roma technical paper Jn language processing  .
