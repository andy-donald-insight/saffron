An overview of the DLT ( Distributed Language Translation ) project is given . This project is aimed at a new , multilingual MT system in the 1990s , which uses Esperanto as an internal interlingua . The system's , architectural features , current progress and project organization are dealt with  . 
1. Introduction
DLT ( Distributed Language Translation ) . is the name of a principle , a design philosophy and a project . Within the area of MT , it represents another approach for steering between the hazards of low-quality output  , endless prolongation of research and development time  , restriction to narrowly-bounded subject fields , the geometric cost expansion when a new language is added  , etc . 
DLT is a concentrated high-tech effort to attain a product line of language translation modules in the  1990s  . 
Together , these modules will constitute an interactive , knowledge-based , multilingual translation system , perfecdy suited for operation on networked esk -top equipment  . 
DLT was conceived in 1979 , in an environment with no historical tiest oMT whatsoever  . After patents had been applied for in 14 countries , the first publication followed at the conference on " New Systems and Services in Telecommunications " in 
Liege\[1980\].
In 1982 , the EEC granted a quarter of a million guilders for a DLT Feasibility Study  , which was completed in 1983 . A remarkable fature of the DLT design , highlighted in this study , was the use of Esperanto as intermediate language  , with its own lexicon . This meant head option of an overall interlingual architecture  , the most ambitious structure known for an MT system  . 
At the same time , the introduction of Esperanto into the MT scene of the  1980s aroused a lot of skepticism and prejudice . As it happens , this semi-artificial language ( invented by an ophthalmo-logist towards the end of the nineteenth century  ) is not usually considered a respectable object of study among professional linguists  . 
2. Design philosophy
The research team at BSO considers Esperanto a valuable tool in language technology  , and has motivated its use as the DLT pivot on rigorou systems engineering grounds : - an overall interlingual rchitecture  , i . e . an MT process of 2 main steps ( instead of 3 ) fits extremely well into the outside operating environment  , which consists of ' senders ' and ' receivers ' linked by a communication set work  ; the interlingua ( or Intermediate Language ) is the ' semi-product'passed over the network , and should be independent of any source or target language in the system  ; -the knowledge-based component of the translation process  , the world-knowledge inferencing system for resolving ambiguities i essentially language -independent and can thereforentirely be builtin the interlingua  ; serving a multilingual system , this is an important economy-of-scale consideration  ; -longterm development and maintenance of a complex translation and world knowledge system is a task that can only succeed with perfect man -machine interfaces for the system engineers  ; linguists , lexicographers , terminologists and other specialists must be offered quick and easy access to the heart of the translation machinery  ; this calls for an interlingua that is direct lY , legible ; at the same time , the interlingua should be lexicologically autonomous and well-defined  , the former eliminating the need for re -paraphrasing in other languages  , the latter being a prerequisite for distributed system development  ( language teams working to and from one common interlingua  )  ; Esperantomeets these requirements . 
3. Prototype construction
In 1984 , BSO setup a plan for a 6-year research and development project ( 7 5 person-years at the cost of 18 million guilders )  , aimed at a DLT prototype capable of translating at least one language pair  ( English-French )  . This plan received the su0port of the Ministry of Economic Affairs of the Netherlands  , which granted an innovation subsidy of 8 million guilders . The first half of this 6-year schedule has now been completed . 
A first prototype of DLT was shown to the press in December  1987  . Though operating only slowly as yet , with a small vocabulary ( 2000 English words ) and a restricted grammar , this laboratory model shows the various monolingual and bilingual processing steps of DLT in proper sequence \ [ see also Fig  .  1\]: 1 . Exhaustive parsing of the English source text . Two different parser implementations have been realized in the search for the fastest formalism : one is based on ATNs and BSO's graphic software environment  ( on SUN 3/50 workstations ) developed for setting up , testing and optimizing ATNs , the other is based on APSG and the PARSPAT software system from the University of 
Amsterdam\[Vander Steen , 1987\].
The parsing process in DLT is breadth-first , syntax-only , and delivers dependency ( not constituency ) trees . 
2 . Surface translation ( first hail ) . Contrastive syntactic rules between English and Esperanto are applied here  . This system of bilingual rules ( 250 at present ) is based upon dependency grammar formalizations of both languages  . 
The methodological framework has been inspired by the work of the French linguist Tesniere and is comprehensively described in \[ Schubert  ,  1987\] . Semantic considerations are disregarded systematically at this stage  . 
The result is a ( sometimes large ) number of ' formally possible ' parallel translations  . 
756 3 . Main semantic analysis , entirely carried out in the Intermediate Language  , by searching through a knowledge base of some 75 . 000  ( present status ) semantically related Esperantoword pairs , and by applying text-grammatical principles of cohesion etc  . to the intermediate stage of the t~rauslated text \[ Papegaaij  , 1986 and 1988\] . 
This automatic disambiguation system , written in Quintus PROLOG , now largely serves as a rating ( preordering ) of parallel surface translations , prior to the disambiguation dialogue which follows it  . The DLT design offers along . term perspective for steady improvement of this wobabitistic component  , ultimately by machine learuing . 
4 . Disambigu_ation dialogue . The user is prompted to make a choice out of the possible interpretations lited on the screen  . Note that these are parallel surface translations  , backo translated ( ' paraphrased ' ) into the source language . 
For the user ~ the disambiguation dialogue is a strictly monolingual affair  , and free of linguistic jargon . In the present realization of the DLT prototype , mainly lexical ambiguities can be displayed . 
5 . Surface tr~nslation ( . . second half ) . As Step 2 above , but now between tile Intermediate Language and French  . Some 500 contrastive syntactic rules have been implemented so far  . Though the proliferation of parallel translations iless at this side of the translation process  ( due to the syntactic unambiguity of Esperanto and its lack of homonyms  )  , it is not absent . If the target lauguage happens to have a more refined " cutting  . .up - of-reality " in some concept area ( like the proverbial 10 words for's now ' in Eskimo )  , parallel translations will result . All the results of this step are in the form of dependency trees  . 
6 . Additiom fl semantics . TL-specific selection criteria are applied to select heright word  . But because these criteria are knowledge-based ( we are not talking of idiomatic phenomena )  , they are restated in terms of the IL , and the selection process is carried out on the intermediate stage of the translated text  , using the Esperanto knowledge bank again , if the context does not provide enough clues , a default choic ~( e . g . the least specific word for's now ' ) will be made . In contras to the source language half of the system  , there is no possibility for human intervention here  . 
7 . ~ sij . of the target sentence . In this tree-to-string conversion , the TL-specific word order is determined ( including the applicat kmofelision and contraction rules  )  . 
4. Project outlook
BSO is now in the process of preparing for the next phase of the project  ( budgeted at 12 million guilders )  , in which the emphasis will be on largescale dictionary and knowledge base expansion  , and relaxation of grammar restrictions . 
Work done on DLT in the past 5 years confilans the feasibility of its architecture and its instrumental use of Esperanto  . Some of the modifications to Esperanto thought necessary \[ Witkam  ,   1983\] in its pivotal MT function appeared to be unnecessary as work on DLT progressed  , i . e . the Intermediate Language is closer to Esperanto now than it looked like in the beginning  . Criticizers ' predictions that the ill_ , would keep changing and would drift further and further away from Esperanto  , have not been borne out . 
The essence of DLT is not so much an attempt at an unambiguous intedingua  , but rather : a split of the overall I Tanslation sequence into a form part and a ~ part  , in which file former is arranged as a . ~ ou Lb . ~ . : dir_L ?_~ and the latter as an interlingual/VII " pl'oc  ; ess . , The doublerdirect process is the surface translation referred to above  ( Steps 2 and 5 )  , which could be loosely characterized as " . dumb syntax " . The interlingual process corresponds Io Steps 3 and 6 above , and contains all the 8 e_r ~ tics ( including knowledge-based inferencing )  . 
Meanwhile , the share of IL-based or IL-directed work in the over all translation sequence-form part as well as content part-has increased considerably  , compared to the initial design of 1982 \ [ see Fig .  2\] . In the form part , which is bilingual and purely syntactic , the Esperanto 1L plays the role of " metataxis partner " for every source and target language  ( ' metataxis'istile contrastive-syntactic transformation f dependency trees  )  . The content part is monolingual , i . e . the semanticsia question of IL-only . It goes with ontsaying that such a design can only succeed by virtue of the fact that Esperanto is a well defined language on its own  , with a well defined syntax and lexicon , and with the help of project staffluent in or at least conversant with that language  . 
The logistics of DLT development draw heavily upon the existence of Esperanto resources in the widest sense : linguists with Esperanto training  , Esperantists with degrees in languages or with extensive translator's experience  , corpora of moder uEs per anto texts , etc . Timely availability of these resources in sufficient quantity and quality demand some special organization alnd promotional activity from the DLTent repreneurs  . 
This means crossing international borders , including the border between EEC and COMECON countries  . East European countries have a relatively large base of Esperanto speakers  , and much ongoing activity . The Budapest Eotvos Lor and University has a chair in Esperanto  . In Poland , a new Esperanto center connected with the University of Bjalistok has been founded in  1987  . 
In Bulgaria an international training center exists  , and in l ~' a guean International Center for Esperanto Terminology has recently been established  . 
The challenge of the DLT project is therefore as much an organizationals a technological challenge  . Cooperation with Hungarian , Finnish and Czech linguists has already begun , and preparatory work has been arranged with collaborators in East Asian countries  . Diversity of language types is a deliberate aim for the multilingual DLT system of the  1990s   , and tile designed architecture makes it technically feasible  . It can be hoped that , against the background of ' glasnost ' and ' p e r e s t r o j k a '  , fruitful and effective East-West cooperation may add to the success of a system for international use and of general interest to the growing community of computational linguistic students and researchers  .
