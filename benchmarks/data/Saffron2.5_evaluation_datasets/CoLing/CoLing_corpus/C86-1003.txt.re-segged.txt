Therefore , semanti . c . 
features are analyzed by the structure embedded into the case frame in Japanese syntactic analysis : these features play an important role when selecting words in the transfer phase from Japanese into Pk qglish  . 
Semantic features are more word specific . Pairs of deep cases and nouns should be writ ten in the lexicon  . k ) we ver , due to the huge number of nouns , it is more effective to include pairs of the deep cases and semantic markers in the lex icon instead of nouns  . 
The Ms-project . is a Japanese national project supported by the S'l'A  ( Scienee and Technology Agency ) " Research on a Machine Translation System ( JapaneseEng \] ish ) for Scientific and Technologica \] . 
Documents . "* ~ Transfer Apprpach to Machine Translation We are currently restricting the domain of translation to abstract papers in scientific and technological  , fields . The system is based on a transfer approach and consists of three phases  ; analysis , transfer and generation . 
In the first phase , morphological analysis divides sentence into lexical items  , then syntactic analysis is carried out by syntactic and semantic analyses of ' Case Grammar in Japanese  . In the second transfer phase , lexical features are transferred and at , these in etime , the syntactic structures are transferred by maldn  , ; them match tree patterns between Japanese and English  , Here , we use semantic features Lo select words for t ranslation into English  . In the final generation phase , syntactics tru ? % urcs are generated by the Phrase Structur cGrammar and the morphological features of ErR  ; lish .

Morpholoo : Jeal analysis and generation program are described in L\]:SP  , which is adequate for morphological proeess in Japanese and English  , whi\]e syntactic analysis , transfer and generation programs are written in GRADE  ( Grammar DEs criber )  . Such process written JnGRAI ) E are independent of natura \] . 
languages in machine translation . GRADE allows a grammar writer to write grammars using the same expression in al\] three phases  . 
Grammatica \] rules written in GRN\]E ( Gl~mmar DEs criber ) are trans\[ . ated into internal forllis , which are expressed by S-expression in LISP . This trans\] . at Jon is performed by GRADE trans\] . ator .

Case Grammar in Japanese;
In Japan , we\[lave come to the cone \] usion that case grammar is the most effective one for " Japanese syntactic analysis in machine translation systems  . 
This type of grammar has been proposed and studied by Japanese linguists before Fillmore's presentation  . 
As the word order " is heavily restricted in F ~ iglish syntax  , ATNG ( Au~nented Transition Network Grammar ) based on CFG ( ContextFree Grammar ) is adequate for syntactic ; analysis . However , Japanese word order is almost unrestricted and Kok ~ j_q  , ~ hi ( postpositonal case particle ) play an important role as deep eases in Japanese sentences  . Therefore , case grammar is the most effective method for Japanese * This project was carried out with the aid of a special grant for the pronlotion of science and technology from the ~- ience and Technology Agency of the Japanese Government  . 
13 syntactic and semantic analyses.
In Japanese syntactic structure , the word order is unrestricted except for p redicates  ( verbs or verb phrases ) which will be located at the end of sentences  . In Case Ora , mar , verbs play a very important role in syntact i canalysis  , and the other parts of speech act only in par tnership with or subordinate to verbs  . 
That is , syntactic analysis is made by e hecking the semantic compatibility between verbs and nouns  . 
Consequently , the semantic structure of a sentence can be extracted at the same time as syntactic an a lysis  .

This section describes what the system of semantic information for nouns is and what the concept of semantic markers is and how semantic markers are attached to nouns  . 
5 . 1 System of semant ica l in fo rmat ion for nouns 1   ) Study in the primary stage of our study , we thought that all nouns were symbols to di splay the following concepts recognized by humans  . We setup four concepts : in heighest level ; " Concrete objects " , " Abstract concepts " , " Phenomena " , and " lluman actions " . Concrete objects are the self same objects in the world  . Abstract concepts are the standards which fix intellectual activities of hunlank in d  . 
Phenomena include both social , phenomena and natural phen onlena . \[\[ unlanactions are the selfs a meacted by humans  . W c assigned facets to these four concepts . 
Then we further extracted the feature of a park from these facets and assigned a new facet " Parts ?  . 
Similarly , another coneept of " Attribute " was extrac ted from ? Phenomena ? and " lluman actions "  . This feature is crucial especially for actionnous  . Thus we added two faee Ls ; " Parts " and ? Attribute " . Nouns also include concepts of measurement , space & topography and time . So we added three facets ; " Measurements " , " Spaces & Topography " , and " Time " . 
We classified into lnore concepts as fol lows  . 
The concept of concrete objects arc-class if ied into " Nations & Organizations '  , ? Animate objects ' arid " inanimate objects " which const\]Lute three independent concepts  . The concept of Ihmlan actions was elass if Jedt . wo facets , " Sen:~e & Feeling " and " Actions ? . 
We rallied the scope formed by the concept " conceptual category "  . It is difficu\]k to define the conceptual scope e  . xplicitly . The concept which can be defined explicit ly in the conceptual category is called a facet  . The face ti . ssubc \] ass if Jed into a number of semantic slots  . This relation is illustrated i . nfir : ure 5 . 1 . 
/  .  "'-~  .   .   .   .   .  " " "- . /a semantic slot , ' It_----- , --~--~ sei ~ lantic marker ,  ~  .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   . " cateqory afacet\[facetname Figure 5 , I Relationship between Facet and ~ em_antie Mm : ker N  2  ) Subclass Jfication of Facets Facets , for example , were subclassified into slots as follows , the facet of Animate objects was subclassified as semantic slots ? humans "  , " animals ~ , and " plants ? The facet of Phenomena was subelassified as slots " natural phenomena "  , " physical phenomena ? , " power and energies " , " physiological phenomena " , ? social phenomena ? and " social systems and customs '  . We then setup an " others " slot in each face t , for these words which can no the assigned to any slot  . The use of these slots is explained in section 5 . 3 . We will study " others " slots through semantic analysis for nouns  ; new slots or facets may have to be assigned . 
These semantic slots and facets are named semant icmarkers  . The System of Semantic Markers for Nouns is shown in figure  5  . 2 . The system of semantic markers for nouns is made up of  13 conceptual facets including ~ Others ? markers  , and 49 fiiial slots as terminals . 
We also use Special . Semantic Markers for " functional words " which represent some patterns  , syntactic or semantic information . For exmnple , the word " comparison " presupposes more than two nouns  ( arguments )   ; comparison between " A " and " B ? . 
Then , " WK ( Relation ) " as a special semantic marker is attached to the word ? comparison "  . The word " time ? assumes time case . These features suggest an effective device for semantic analysis  . 
5.2 Conceptef ~ mant . ic Harkers
The following descri . besconcepts of 12 facets in the System of Semantic Markers for Nouns  ( ' Other " ( ZZ ) not . included ) . 
l ) Natiens and Organizations ( OF )
This concept . us\]facet includes words related to such functional human groups as nations  , parties , corporations and organizations . Words in this facet can occur with volit ional verbs  , when used as subjects . 
2) Animate Objects ( OV )
This conceptual facet includes such names as that of man  , animal and plant , l lowever , names of organs of the animate objects are included in the slot of " Organs or Components  "   ( EL ) under the face to f " Part . " . Names of diseases are included in the slot of " Physiological phenomena"  ( PB ) under " the facet of " Phenolllerla " . 
3) Inanimate Objects ( CkS)
This e once pLual facet only includes words rela ted to concrete objects in the inanimate ob jects  , such as natural substances , parts and materials of products , artificial substances and J . nstitutions . The objects which do not exist as concrete objects are included in the facet of ? Inte ll  . eetua \] Objects " . 
4 ) Intellectual Objects ( IO ) " IO " includes words related to theories , abstract tools and materials , intellectual products that are created by hunlan intellectual activities  . 
5 ) Phenomena ( t  ~ ) " I ~" includes words related to natural phenomena  , physical phenomena , power & energies , physiological phenomena , social phenomena and systems/customs . Words having causal properties are attached to words under this facet using plus minussigns  ( ? i -" and . . . . ) . Sign "4" denotes desirable conditions ( e . g , success ) , while sign ?" indicates undesirable cond itions  ( e . g . suicide )  6 ) Sense and Feeling ( SO )  ? ( IS ? includes words related to human mental phenomena such as feeling  , reaction , recognition and thinking . 
7 ) Actions ( H ) ) " IX ) " includes words related to human such as human actions and movements  .

5 . 3 flow te attach semantic markers to words \]' he semantic markers for ' nouns are deternlined in the following steps  . 
I ) Attach semantic markers to the following nouns . 
Propcrhouri
Connnon noun
Action noun l ( Sahenmeishi )
Action noun P , ( exeept action noun 1)
Adverbial noun ( only when the words include the ' , concept of " Time " or " l . ocation ")
Interrogative pronoun
Persona \] pronoun
Demonstrative pronoun ( only when the words include tile c . one ept of "\[ , oeation " )  2 ) Attach semantic markers to the : words according to the definition  , semantic scope and examples given in the " definition table " of semantic markers  . 
3 ) Do not attach semantic markers to the following words : 
Molecular formulas
Arithmetic expressions
Names of product models 4 ) \] if a word belongs to multiple slots in the same face t  , attach all relevant markers . 
5 ) if a word belongs to a facet but this word not belongs to any appropriate slot in the facet  , attach " others " marker in this facet to that word  . 
6) if a word is equal to a facet name itself , attach the semantic marker of that facet name to the word  . 
7 ) If the concept of a word is not included in any facet  , attach " Others ? faeet(ZZ ) to that word . 
8 ) For compound words consisting of more than one word  , attach the markers putting into consider at ion semantic information of the compound words themselves  ; do not always attach the marker only to the las telement of the compound  . 
6 . Sen ! anti . c Information for Adverbs In our system , adverbs are subelassified follows . 
I ) Adverb of condition ( Joukyoufukushi )  2 ) Adverb of degree ( Teidofukushi ) as 3 ) Adverb of state Jnent ( Chinjutsufuku-shi )  4 ) Adverb of quantity ( Suur you fukushi ) Besides , the aspects of verbs are c\]assified ' , " Mood " , " Aspect ? , " Tense ? , and " Degree " . They contrast specific adverbs . Then semantic information for adverbs is used to ensure more accurate translations  . Semantic information for adverbs are defined according to the concept aspects as follows  . 
I ) Semantic information on mood determined by the adverb of statenl cntSubjunctive  ( e . g . if ), Interrogation ( e . g . when ), Negation ( e . g . not always ), Desirability ( e . g . 
possibly ), Entireness ( e . g . entirely ), Concession ( e . g . 
kindly ) 2 , ) Semantic in format ion on aspects of verbs determined by the adverb of condition Complet ~ on  ( e . g . finally ), Progression ( e . g . 
rapidly ), Repetition ( e.g . repeatably),
Convent Jon ( e . g . accordingly )  3 ) Seinantie information on tense determined by adverb of condition and statement Past  ( e . g . yesterday ), Present ( e . g , now ),
Future(e . g . tomorrow )  4 ) ~mantic infornlation on degree when the adverb or adjective can be modified by the adverb of degree and quantity Scale  ( e . g , ser Jous \] . y ), Degree(e . g . fairly ) 7 , Examples of Semantic Marker ~\ [ Jscdi ~ An Qlys i  , s7 . 1 DeDernfination of tile Usage of Verbs by Case

Ca ~: e patterns are used to detern fine the usage of verbs having broader concept  . This is especially an effectiven lethod in determining the meanings of  !~9o verbs ( basic Japanese verbs ) having broader concepts like Ene~\]ish verbs , " make " , " do " , " take ' , ? put ' , etc . 
We take Io9o verb "~ hTzZ , " as an example and show the difference of the meanings of verb "  ?'1kS " by mean of ' case paDtern ( a )  , ( b ) , ( c ) . Furthermore we show the semantic markers which co -occur to each casc  .

7 . 2 In terpretat ion of Optional Cases One tCqkt!jo : shi  ( surface case ) often plays the role of different deep eases in Japanese  . Often , various optional cases are included in this deep ease  . Factoptional , case is determined by the combination of K ( gcujo:sltt ( surface case ) and the semantic marker of the noun which co occurs with it in the dictionary  . In the process of transfer , appropriate English prepositions must be specified according to each determined opt ional deep case  . 
For example , takek uk ~ jo-shi " ~" , The optional case is deternlined from the semantic marker of noun and the semantic marker which cooccurs with the surface case of the verb  .   1'hen the case frame in English is selected arid the preposition " in " is determined  . This process is shown as follows . 
Ex .   ( 1 ) Source sentence : J -& L-<J\]t~Eft~D~\]tLz~'6   ~2'l~fl/il~lik  "\]  7  , % ~7<& O-$;~Ic . -> t ,   , - < a~lIJI < , Translated sentence : The numerically cont rolled super high speed drilling machines are explained which are active mainly now in markets  . 
Explanation of Example ( 1 ) : Let us observe the Japanese Analysis Dict ionaries for Noun and Verb shown in Figure  7  . 1 . The noun < fl ~ N ( market ) > has semantic markers ( SA and PS ) according to Noun Dictionary , while verb <? ~\[ ~8 ( be active ) > has ( SA or OF ) for the noun according to cases lo t2 of case pattern in the verb dictionary . ? Market " and " be active " match with each other with respect to smnantic marker " SA "  . Thus , the surface case <~> in the Japanese input sentence is determined to have the surface case " SA "  , which corresponds to case label <~> SPA ce+Ex . (2) Source sentence : ~ flill IgT ~ l,II z2 . & t---~N ~ IIZ % ? ilc- ) Translated sentence : Problems are solved bg two handling methods about laser absorption terms by the inversed amping radiation  , and numerical solutions are obtained . 
Explanation of Example ( 2 ) : Using these Dictionaries , the noun < INO~I , ' P ~ ( handling methods ) > has semantic markers ( ! C and AN ) while verb < ~ g < ( solve ) > has ( DA , IT , J_C or TS ) for the noun preceding the Kaknjo-shi . " handling methods " and " solve " match with each other with respect to " IC ?  .

8, Exanp\]es of Selantic Markers Use ( lin Transfer
Process in the transfer ' phase the English verb is chosen by examining the semantic markers for nouns filling the deep case slot of " the condition part of the verb transfer dictionary  . 
Two examples of selecting the traslation for the Japanese verb  , " ~'" areas foil ? us : Ex . (1) Source sentence : * l-I ~ , ~ J : U~6?x2 yg Translated sentence : The radiation and convection models of the vertical mercury arcs which contain the sodium and the scandium iodide  . 
gx .   ( 2 ) Source sentence :~6~iE~f~K ~ J-a ? 14 ~ bN~ea ~ No Translated sentence : Lemmas are verified by showing specific constitut ion methods about constitution methods of the normal double orthogonal bases which i ~ clud ~ given normal double orthogonal systems  . 
Explanation of Example (1):
Based on the Japanese to English Transfer Dic tionary  , Figure 8 . 1 , both lJ-bIO ~ ( so dium ) > and <~5 ? x~~99 ~ ( scandiumio dine ) > in Example ( 1 ) have OM . According to the conditions of the dictionary , ~ matches one of the semantic markers ( OSO~jP NPB PPPE ) in correspond to the appropriate case slot ( in this case < .  ~  ( object case ) >  ) of Japanese case frame in the dictionary for the verb < ~ O >  ( contain , include ) . So verb " contain " is selected .

Thus , verb " include " , which is the default w due of the English word  , is selected .

Acknow \] edgmen
We would like to thank Prof . Makoto Nagao , Prof . 
Junichi Tsujii , Mr . Junichi Nakamura ( F ~ oto University ), Mrs . Mutsuko Kimura ( Institute for Behavior and Science )  , and Miss Masako Kume ( Japan Convention Services , Inc . ) and the other members of the Mu project working group for the useful discussions which led to many of the ideas presented in this paper  . 
I ) When semantic markers are attached by human operation  , several problems arise . The first problem is simple mistakes made by humans  . The second problem is a fluctuation of semantic analysis due to a large amount of data  . So it is necessary to develop an automatic marking system to save time and to improve efficiency  . 
P ) When assigning semantic markers to nouns , we attached them without considering the relationship between nouns and verbs  . That is , we attached semantic markers simply based on noun concepts  . This is not adequate to handle nouns which are intrinsically related to verbs  . One of the solutions to this problem will be to study the correlation matrix of the semantic markers for nouns in relation to the case frame of verbs  . 
3 ) Our system of semantic markers for nouns has been designed for Japanese nouns  . We have to design a syst ~ , of semantic mgrkers for English nouns . Since recognition for its concept in an Enlish word is very difficult for the Japanese  , we are also studying a method of evaluation test to handle these data  . 
4 ) Our system of semantic markers for nouns simply consists of the tree structure of facets and slots  . Subclassification for these structures with deep tree structure is a significant problem in order to analyze the concept of nouns more in detail  , but such a semantic marking operation will be c~ne more c~nplex and difficult for I  )  , 2) problems . 
5 ) We suppose that a concept system for words is not a static structure  , but various semantic networks constructed dynamically according to a given sUory  . 
We must give thorough consideration to this prospective problems  .
