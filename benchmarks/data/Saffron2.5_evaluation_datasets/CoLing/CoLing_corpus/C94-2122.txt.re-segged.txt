Abstract
Polysemy is one of the major causes of difficulties in se-lnantic clustering of words in a corpus  . In this paper , we first ; give a definition of polysemy from the viewpoint of clustering and then  , b ~ rsed on this definition , we propose a clustering method which reeognises verbal  1  ) olysemics from a textual corpus . The results of experiments denmn strate the effectiveness of the pro- 
I ) osed method.

Most of this work is based on similarity measures derived fl ' om the distrilmtion of woMs in corpora  . However , the Nets that a single word does have more than one meaning and that the distribution of a word in a corpus is a mixture of usages of different meanings of the same word often hamper such atteml ~ ts  . 
The meaning of a word depends on the domain in which it is used  ; the sitme word c ' an be use ( l differently in different dolnains . It is also often the ease the fta word which is l /olysemous in general is not l  ) olysemousinar (  , strieted subject domain . In general , restriction of tllc subject domain makes the t ) roblen l of 1 ) olysemyless l ) rol ) lematie . However , even in texts fronlare stricted domain such as Wall Street Journall  , one en-eount . ersquite a large nuln ber of l ) olyselnous words , in particular , unlike nouns , verbs are ofteni/olys ( mw use v ( , n in a restricted subject domain . 
Because polysemous verbs are usually also high -frequency verbs  , their treal : ment is crucial illactual applications  . Furthermore , beea use of their high-frequen (: y , polysemous verbs tend to have a harmfl flin-th , ence on the senlantice htstering of l/ollns ,  \] ) ee all SO semantic clustering of nollns is usually 1  ) eribrmed based on th (  . ireollo (' ational 1)e haviour with verbs .

Although polysemy is said to be widespread in language  , the definition of polysemy is highly subjective . 
Polysemy can only be recognised by hunmn intuition and different linguists often identify a different number of senses in the same word  . In this paper , we first give a definition of polysemy fl ' om the viewpoint of clustering  , and propose an overlapping clustering method which automatically reeognises polysemous words  . The results of experiments are also given to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method  . 
2 Related Work
Although there have been several attempts to extract semantically similar words from a  , given corpus , few studies seriously deal with the problenl of 1 ) olysemy ; of these , even fewer are based on real texts . 
The techniques developed by Zernik\[Zernik , 1991\] and Brown\[Brown ,   1991\] seem to cope with the discrimination of polysemy and  1  ) ell ~ Lse ( lonreal texts . 
Zernik used monolingual texts which consist of about  1 n fillion words tagged by 1  ) art-of-spee ( : h . I~I is method associates ca(-h words e . nse of a polysemous wo M with a set of its cooccurring words  . If a word has seweral senses , then the word is assoeiated with several different sets of cooccurring words  , each of which corresponds to one of the senses of the word  . The linfita-tion of Zernik's method , however , is that it solely relies on human intuition for identifying different senses of a word  , i . e . the human editortlas to determine , by her/his intuition , how many seils es a word has , and then identii ~ y the sets of cooccurring words ( signa-t . lcres ) that correspond to the different senses . 
Brown used bilingual texts , which consist of \]2 million words . The results of Brown's technique , when al ) -plied to a French-English nmchine transb ~ tion system  , seems to show its eflbctiveness and validity . However , as head mits , the at ) preach islinfited because it can only assign at most two senses to a word  . More seriously , 1) olysemy is defined in terms of translation , i . e . 
only when a word is L ranslated into two different words in a target language  , it is recogniscd as polysemous . 
The apllroach can bcused only when a large 1 ) a ral-lel corpus i sawdhtble . Furthermore , individual senses thus identified ( 1 ( 1 not neeessarily constitute single semantic units in the monolingual domain to which  1  ) lau-sible semantic prollertics ( i . e . semantic rest ; rictions , The defects of these two method show that it is crucial to have an N  ) pr ( )l ) riate detinition of polyscmy in terms of distributimml  1  ) charours of words in monolingual texts . The approach proposed iuthispaper focuses on this problem  . Like Brown's apl ) roach , our al ) proach ad(lpts ; L rebttivist . ic vicw of polysclny . That is , ~ word is rccognised as l ) olysen mus in terms of other relai . ed words . .\[owever , while Brown'sal ) l ) roachid cn-tilies polysemous words in terms of rela ~ ted words of ramher l migui ~ gc  , we . use semantically similar words of the same llm guage to identify polysemous words  . 
Whether a word is polysemous or nol ; depends on whether i ~ set of other , semanti ( ' Mly similar words exists whose distrilmtional 1 ) eh ~ viours correspond to its it bset of the distribution M behaviour of the word  . 
Because tile distributional beiu ~ viour of it word is character seal  1  ) y its cooccurring words , the t ) rocess of identifying such subsets essentially corresl muds to  1  . he1) rocessll crformed manually by : hehmnanedil . or in

2 . While certain usages of tttke have sense similm ' to buy  , spend , ~ tn dobt ~ t in , these three specific v(~x'l)sh~tve distinct , senses and we hardly see synonymy it mong these verbs  . 
In the space spanned by the three axes , each as s()-ci~tted with stake , tim (' , a . nd product , t . ~ tke does not constitute a clust . er with a aly of the three wu ' bs , take cooccurs with the three iiO/lltSiLll ( hits high " m , uv ;- tlles with t . hen i , while \] lily , spend lind obtain have high m , u values only with one of the three nmms . Therefore , I . he(1 . istaIK:c8\[)el ; WOelt take mid these three verbs are large & lid the synonymy of fake with them  ( lisl q ) petu's .

However , these algorithms assume that ewm an entity which belongs to more than one clusters is still a single entity  . An entity behmgs to several clusters because it can be seen from several different viewpoints  . ' ritesame entity , for example , egg , can be seen as food , like bread , and asing redients-of-food , like flour , at the same time . 
However , as we saw in the above , polyselnous verbs can be captured more naturally by seeing them as multiple entities  , which hal ) pen to take the same surface form . takel , take 2 and take 3 are distinct ; entities ( we ( : all them hypothetical verbs in the following ) with which different sets of nouns cooccur , and with which , therefore ~ ditferent contexts are associated . 
Therefore , unlike standard overlapping clustering algorithms  , our algorithm explicitly introduces new entities when an entity is judged polysemous and associates them with contexts which are subcontexts of the context of the original entity  . Our algorithm has two basic operations , splittin 9 and lumping . Splitting means to divide a polysemous verb into two hypothetical wwbs and lumping means to combine two hypo-theticai verbs to make one verb out of them  . 
4 Measur ing the Compactness of a Group o f Verbs The algorithm should decide when a verb hastohe split into two hypothetical verbs  . The decision is based on a measure of these l -ilan~  ; ic compactness of a group of verbs . The semantic ompactness of a group of verbs is a measure which shows the degree of dispersion of the group in an n-dimensional space  . The compactness of a group of verbs , VG = v l , v2 ,   . . . , v , ~, is defined as follows . 
1 . Let vi be one of the verbs v , , ? . . , v , , , and a vector assigned to vibe(vii ,  " " , vm ) . Each vij ( 1 < j <_ n ) is computed by the following formula . 
vii = mu(vi , t , j ) if ' mu(vi , n5)>_a , 0 otherwise (1) II er e , mu(vi , nj ) is the vahle of mutual informa-et ion defined in \[Chur Jr  , 1991\] between t ~ i and nj . 
c ~ is a threshold value given in advance.
2 . The centre of gravity of a group of verbs , vl ,  ? ? . , v ,   , is the mean vector of the vectors assigned to the verbs ~ which is used to eompute the disper-sions of the individual verbs in the group  . The (: entre of gravity ~=( gt ,  ' "  , g ~) , and the length of it I9\[ , are defined as follows . 
(,?1, . ???~) = ~' i ~ , ""--vi ,   , )' H ? , i = li=1 tlWt(2) 3 . The dispersion , disp(vl, .   .   .   , ~4~) , indicates the compaetness of a group and is def in ed~ts : disp  ( vl , " "  , v . ~) = i=1 j=\[4 . Let us think of two clusters of verbs , A and B , which have the same degree of dispersions . If IgI of A is larger than that of B , the absolute vMue of mu calculated for A is larger than that of  \]3  . 
This means that the absolute probabilities of cooccurrences of each not ln and the verbs of A is larger than those of B  ; zusa result , A shouhl be judged to be semantically more compact han B  . 
Therefore , the dispersion of (3) is amrmalised ms : 5 . 
disp(v ~, .   . , vm ) ~ t,i . ~  . > o , < , , ~, .   .   .   ,  ~ , ,~) = I~1 (4) disp , ~ o , , of (4) is prolmrdonal to the number of verbs . This means that a cluster of a greater number of verbs tends to be judged to be less compact han those  , of a smaller number of verbs . 
Therefore , the dispersion of ( 4 ) should be fl ~ rther normalised to compens at c the effect of the number of verbs in a group  . This normalisation is done by least square estimation  . The result is (5) , which will be used to measure the COml ) aetness of a group of verbs . 
C ' o , , , ( , , ~, .   .   . , <, ~) = , lisv , , , .  ( ,~ , ,  .   .   . , , , , , , ), 8* m-7 (/3 = 0 . 964, 7 = 0 . 495 ) is a coetfi-eient that is eml ) irically determined by least square estimation 2 . 
In the following , we use ( 5 ) a stllew due which shows the coml ) act ncss of a groul )  . A group with a smaller value of ( 5 ) is judged semantically more compact . 
2 In this case , we set a ' in (\[) equa \] s\[o2 . 0 .
