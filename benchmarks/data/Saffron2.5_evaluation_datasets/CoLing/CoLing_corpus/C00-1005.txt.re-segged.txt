Sharing portions of grammars across languages greatly reduces the costs of nutltilingual grammar engineering  . Related language share an tuch wider range of linguistic it ff ' or nuttio  ; t than typically assunw d instamlard mt tl tiling ttalgramt mtrat white ctures  . Taking grammatical relatednesseriously , we are particularly interested in designing lht guistically motivated grammatical resottrces Jbr Slavic languages to be used it z applied and theoretical computational linguistics  , ht order to gain the pelw pective of a language -family oriented gramntar desigtl  , we consider tttarrtly of systematic relations that can hold between syntactical units  . While the categorisation of primitive linguistic entities tends to be language-specilic or even constrttction -  . ~pecific , the relations holding between them allow viii ' lofts degrees of absltztction  . On the basis of Slavic & tta , we show how a domain ontology conceptualising molpho-syntaclic " buildiltg blocks " can serve as a basis r ~" a shared grotlt  ; nar of Slavic . 

In applied computational linguistics , the need for developing and utilising operational notions of shared grammar stems fi'om multilingual grammar engineering  . If considerable portions of existing grammars can be reused for the specification  ot7 new grammars , development eft brts can be greatly reduced . A shared grammar also facilitates the difficult task of lnaintaining consistency within and across the individual parallel grammars  . In machine translation , the specification of a shared grammar can furthermore be exploited for simplifying the transfer process  . 
Without muchado , computational linguists engaged in multilingual grammar development have always tried to reduce their labour by importing existing grammar components in a simple " copy-paste-modify " fashion  . But there were also a number of systematic attempts to create and describe shared grammars that are convincingly documented in publications  .  \[  Kam88\] demonstrates the concept for a relatively restricted domain  , the grammatical description of simple nominal expressions in five languages  .  \[  BOP88\] were able to exploit the grammatical overlap of two Slavic languages  , for the design of a lean transfer process in Russian to Czech machine translation  . In multilingual application development within Microsoft research  , grammar sharing has extensively been exploited-\ [   Pin96\]  , \[GLPR97\] . 
However , all these approaches are rather opportun-istic in the sense that existing grammatical descriptions based on existing grammar models were explored  . We went a step further and started grammar design with a notion of a shared grammar for a family of related languages  . Pursuing the goal of designing linguistically motivated grammatical resources for Slavic languages to be used in computational linguistics  , one is inevitably confronted with primary problem stemming ti ' om the t'act that different linguistic theories cut up grammars in quite different ways  , and grammar formalisms differ in their degree of granularity  . It cannot be expected , therefore , that the minimal differences between two languages or their shared elements for measily identifiable units in the available language -specific grammars  . Therefore , an ontology conceptualising morphosyntactic " building blocks " would offer a solid basis for a shared grammar of Slavic in the sense of \[  ASU99\]  . Our use of the term ontology is fairly pragmatic , namely , as representing a formal shared conceptualisation fa particular domain of interest  . It describes concepts relevant for the domain , their relationships , as well as " axioms " about these concepts and relationships  . Note that such a pragmatic approach does not presuppose any general all-encompassing ontology of language but rather " mini-ontologies " conceptualising the selected domain from various perspectives in a consistent way  . The domain of interest in this project is the grammatical knowledge on Slavic morphosyntax contained in linguistic theories and linguistic descriptions  . While the categorisation of primitive linguistic entities lends to be language-specific or even construction-specific  , the relations holding between them allow various degrees of abstraction  . 
In order to gain the perspective of language -family oriented grammar design  , we will consider the array of . s3 , stematic relations that can hold between syntactically significant items  . 
Systematic relations
Systematic relations motivate shared patterns of variation crosslinguistically as well as a cross constructions  . In a constraint-based theory like HPSG , where the grammatical properties of linguistic entities are typically revealed in complex taxonomies  , nothing in the formal apparatus would actually exclude the possibility to organise also the relations holding in syntactic onstructions in a type hierarchy  . So , the type subsumption could be interpreted as modelling a continuum from general-and presumably universal-systematic relations to more and still more specific instances of these relations resulting fi'om admissible cross -classifications  . IIn I The two types of edges connecting types in otug  , ' aphical representation fhier archies -' square ' and ' direct'-are significant  . The former indicate possible conjunction of types  , and thus introduce various dimensions of multiple in he  , ' itance . The latter indicate disjunction of types within the respective dimension of classification  . 
98 our view , two orthogonal types of systematic relations have to be distinguished : syntagmatics and alignment  , since they appear to be universally relevant for the well-forned lmss of utterances in any language  ( Hierarchy I )  .   2 Syntagmatic relations play a constitutive role in syntaxby establishing instant COlmections between linguistic entities in various constructions  . There is a cover t , meaningful dime , > sion of structural syntagmatics , a + da , l()Vel"t . ,  , llOl "- phosyntactic , form-oriente dimension of combinatorial syntagmatics  .

The continuity of syntactic units can be realised its immediate constituency  ( i . e . of type continuous ) or as long-distance constituency ( i . e . o1' type discon-tinue++s ) . The directionality accounts for situations where , e . g . , Ihe head either li ) llows the dependent or precedes it . In turn , the i ~ eriphcry of a syntactically determined omain can be left or right  . 
Structural syntagmatics
The structural syutagnatic relations between two syntactic units is classified along two primary dimensions which we call centH city and taxis  ( Hierarchy 3 )  . The chosen terms should be under -~ tr stood in the context of dist in  . uish in ~ , on the one hand , endocentricim dexocentric relations , and on the other hand , h37m taxix and parataxis . The endo-centricity of a strt , ctural syntagmatic relation ( between , e . g . , ~ and \[~ ) presupt mses that one of the syntactic items involved in this relation  ( e . g . , c0 plays a proninent role . In contrast , the exocenlricity of a structural syntag , natic relation presupl ) oses no assun+ptions in this respect , hence , it can be viewed as the unmarked member of the centricity opposition  .

Consequently , if two linguistic entities belong together fi'om the viewpoint of structural syntagt nat-its  , they are involved in one of the following relation types which arc obtained via + admissible cross-classifications  ( Hierarchy 4 )  .

Exocentric parataxis . In the relation holding between lhcil wolved linguistic entities there is neither a prominent element nor a head-dependent configuration  . This is the tmlnarked case with respect to both ccnlricity and taxis  .

But there is no consensus -- often even within the same linguistic theory-on the structural interpretation of the exocentric relations  . So , additional factors are usually taken into consideration asst  , pporting the in -+ , ' eduction of particular conventions . The latter , however , arc not always linguistically motiwtted , theory-sl~ecific technical reasons . 
Combinatorial syntagmatics
The combinatorial dimension in tile proposed taxonomy  ( Hierarchy 5 ) largely corresponds , in our understanding , to what \[ S&L95\] regard as morphological signalling of direct syntactic relations  . 

I combinatorial . ----..
juxtaposition covariation government
Hicrm'chy 5: Combinatorial synt~matics Tile combinatorial syntagmatic relation of juxtaposition presupposes no overt morphological indication  . As to governmettt , i is traditionally understood as the determination by one element of the inflectional form of the other  , i . e . form government . 
Its classical instance is , of course , case government . 
In \[ Cann93\](p .  51 ) these morpllosyntactic relation is formulated for some construction involving y and  ( 5 illtile following way : y governs ( 5 if ( i ) varying the inflection all ' or m of ( 5 while keeping T constant leads to ungrammaticality  , and ( ii ) varying the form of t and keeping 8 constant makes no difference to grammaticality . The systematic co-variatiol l o1' linguistic forms is typically rcalised as feature con-gruity  , i . e . compatibility of values of identical grammatical categories of syntactically colnbined linguistic items  . Illour view , two general covariation types must be distinguished  ( cf . Hierarchy 6) , namely , asymmetric and symmetric covariation , with only the former actually corresponding to the traditional directional concept of agreement  , e . g . ,\[ Cor 98\] . 
Cc-vatiatior lasymmetric symmetrical 1~1 ( ' d~It__~t__Jllierarchy 6: Morphosyntaclic covariation As the term suggests , the asymmetry of covariation presupposes a controller-target conl ' iguration  . This is to be contrasted with the synunetry of covariation which is not interpretable in these terms  . 
Symmetrico-variation , in essence , would presume redundancy as if both co-varying syntactic items were controllers and targets at the same time  . 
Endocentric hypotaxis ( selection )
The endocent richypot axis corresponds to the traditional notion of selection  . Even though not directly observable , it underlies specific morphosyntactic realities interpreted in Hierarchy  7 as resulting from a cross-classification with the combinatorial syntagmatic relation types  . 
The traditional notion of subcategorisation call thus be viewed as a selection that is realised via govern-mont  . Two general oplions are usually available across languages l brexternalising the governed selection  ( i . e . subcategorisation ) of nominal categories in actual syntactic on structions  .

Hierarchy 7: Selection
A typical definition of Ihefirslone call be found in \[  Blake94\]: " Case in its most eenral manifestation is a system of marking dependent nouns for the type of relationship they bear to their beads "  . The relational case explicating case government stands in opposition to tiles o called concordial case observed in ease-governed modification environments and presented in Hierarchy  8  . The second option to externalise subcatcg orisation fnominal categories is the cross-referencing the syntactic function of the dependent at the head  . It is actually confined to certain core grammatical relations and typically amounts to some kind of pronominal representation of these grammatical relations attile head  . As\[Blake 94\] observes , the cross-referencing pronominal element serve as an alternative to case ill signalling grammatical relations  . In Slavic , there are two candidales for the second/ype of externalising a governed selection  . Ontile () he hand ,   lh0 verb in l\]cc tion can possibly be interpreted as cross-referencing the sub  . icctfnnetion , especially in Bulgarian where no relational case is realised on the dependent  . On the other band , pronominal elitics can cross-reference the direct and the indirect object in Bulgarian verb complex  , cf . \[ Avg 97 a\] , as well as the possessor relation in Bulgarian noun phrases  , cf . 
\[ Avg97b\] . Therefore , the systematic relation of object cliticisation can be viewed as a more specific instance of cross-referencing  . In general , a nominal category representing a grammatical relation that is cross-referenced at the head selecting this nominal category need not be overtly realised  . So , the cross-referenced noun phrase controlling the agreement can typically be omitted  . 
In our view , the systematic relation of marking ( Hierarchy 7 ) is an instance of juxtaposed selection , i . e . allen do centrie hypotax is that is realised via juxtaposition  . We promote a faMy extensive understanding of this syntactic relation as involving various functional categories  , including auxiliaries , particles , determiners , prepositions , conjunctions , etc . The notion of morphosyntactic marking is introduced in \[  Avg97a \] for syntagmatic relations the main verb as a syntactic  ( and semantic ) head and the possibly nlultipl cauxiliary verbs ; is nlai+kers specifying it . The agreement between the verb and its subject or conlplcm cnt is interpreted in our tax-onotny as a selection real \] seal via asymmetrico-variation  ( agreement 1 )  . It typically occurs in con\]-bination with the relation of subcatcg orisation  ( of .

Finally , what we call matching corresponds to a selection rcaliscd via symmetric covariation  . Its most typical instance can be found where there is compatibility in person  , number or gender between ( possibly multiple ) auxiliaries and a main verb . 
Matching usually co-occut's with a 1nat+king rchition ( cf . Table 2) which , as shown in Hierarchy 7 , is interpreted its a jux lapos cd selection . 
Exocentric hypotaxis ( modification ) The exoc cntrichypot axis corresponds to themt di -tional notion of modification  . It nnderlies specific morphosyntactic realities resulling from a cross-classification with combinatorial syntagmalic relation types  ( cf . Hierarchy 8) . In all of then \] , we are confronted with a +' elation of subordination in which  , however , there is no indisputable prominent clcmen LIt + general we assume that there is no " case agreement "  .

Ix + other words , we cat \] regard concordial case as a typical instance of a governed modification  . The asymmetric covariation real \] sing a modification relation can be called concord  , but let us refer to it-for the sake of sitnplicity-asctgreement  2  . In the majority of Slavic languages , but obviously not in Bulgarian , this relation occurs in combination with concordial case  ( of . Table 3) . 
Note that in our approach the treat+nun+of nominal apposition would be parallel to that of the adjective-noun relations  .

The main difference between tl ~ eagt'eement1 ( Hierarchy 7 ) and the agreement 2 ( or concord ) discussed here amounts to tile fact that these covariation relations exhibit different c cntricity  .

Also the secondaly predication ( referring , typically , to the relation holding between a verb and a secondary controlled predicative  ) is a subtype of juxtaposed modification , with the predicative case adjunction as a more specific instance  . As to the relation holding between the secondary predicative and the subject or the object  , it is an instance o1' control and presupposes coreference . The latter two concepts realise an endo-ccntric parataxis and are introduced in Hierarchy  9  . 
Endocentric parataxis
In the end occntric parataxis there is a prominent item but no subordination relation  . This allows us to model concepts like coreference  , correlation , co-marking ( illustrated by ex .  6 ) and control as naturally resulting from a cross -classification with the combinatorial syntagmatic relation types  . 
If an endocentric parataxis is revealed by an asymmetric covariation  , this results in coreference . This systematic relation is tbund in relativisation  ( i . e . 
between a nominal category and the relative pronoun introducing a relative clause that modifies this nominal category  )  , in resumption ( i . e . between a nominal category and the pronominal element resuming it in a different syntactic domain  )  , and in binding ( i . e . between a pronoun and its antecedent ) . 
When , however , an endocentric parataxis is revealed in a symmetrico-variation  , we can speak of correlation . But in both instances of covariation , we arc confronted with paMng indices ( or restricted parameters ) el ' referential objects . What we propose to distinguish as co-marking corresponds to endo-centrie parataxis that is realised via juxtaposition  . 
So , it contrasts with the systematic relation of marking  ( presented in Hierarchy 7 ) only along the taxis dimension of structural syntagmatics in as much as there is no subordination relation between the involved syntactic items  . As to the systematic relation of syntactic ontrol  , it is registered in our tax-enemy as an cn do centrie paratax is resulting in a for  , n government . In Bulgarian , it cooccurs with coreference-cx . 3 and ex .  4 .

Hierarchy I0: Exocenlrie paralaxis
The relation of co-dependence plays a crucial role in a number of constructions  . It is an exoeent ricparatax is that is realised via government  , with a special requirement that all involved syntactic items have the same governor  . In other words , these items are typically depend cnts of the same syntactic head  . 
What we call agreement 3 ( or accord ) corresponds to an exocentric paralax is that is rcaliscd via asymmetric covariation  . It regularly presupposes a co-typical instance can be fotm d as a CO lnpatibility in number or gender between the subject and the predicative in copular constructions  . Another instance is lheco-dependence relation holding be-lween a dependent of the primary predicate  ( i . e . the verb ) and a secondary predicative in ex . 1 and cx .  2 . 
When exocent ricparataxis is externalised by a symmetric covariation  , we are confronted with parallelism . It cooccurs in ex . 5 with co-dependence . 
The coordinatioll relation is generally interprelable as an exocemric paratactic juxtaposition  .

Conclusion and prospects
We have p , esented an approach of computational grammar design tlmts t  , pports the notion of grammar sharing and , moreover , lends itself to the for-real linguistic description of individual anguages as well as language families  . The basic building blocks of such a grammar were demonstrated with the example of Slavic hm guagcs  . Grammars of this type can straightforwardly be extended and employed in  , qnt lnlbero\["developlncnt and rLiiiI . illle systems accommodating HPSG . Some of these systems have reached a parsing efficiency thai makes them suited for a wu'iety of applications  , \]F () TU2000\[ . Although the original motiwltion for the work call lO from applied research  , the insights thai were gained on the differences between Slavic languages  , led lonew results in comparative linguistic dcscrip/ion  . 
We expecl that psycholinguistic research on bilin - g t  , alism and second language acquisition will greatly benefit from opportunities of modelling shared grammatical knowledge  . The insights gained by such models will in turn be useful for CALL applications and for the computational treatment of cross-language interference ingl ' an anlar and style checking  .
