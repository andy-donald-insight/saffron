1 Introduction
We have bccn developing a Japanese-to-English mad finelrauslation syslem called ALT-J/E  ( lkehm-a et al ,  1987) . In ALT-J/E , Japanese sentence analysis is performed based on lhew dencys lruclure for the predical c of the input sentence  . ALT-J/E c~mtrm~slate several special Japm~ese constnt clions such as predicate idioms and funclion verb expressions  ( Oku ,  1992) . 
The Jap~mese double-subject conslnt clion was nol handled well by the original ALT-J/E  . This paper describe same lhodl brmmlyzing a Japanese double-subject construction having an a d  . ie clive t ) rcdicate bascd on I hevalency structure . 
Simple sentences normally have only one sub . icc tivc case in most languages . However , it is possible for many Japlmese adjectives ( and some verbs ) to dominate two surface subjective cases within a simple sentence  . 
Such sentence structure is called lhedouble -subject construction  . JEiDA ( Ihe Japan Elcclronic Industry Development Associalion  ) has issued evaluations t~mdards for machine lnmslation systems  ( JEIDA ,  1995) . ~I he main aim of lhese standards i to establish objective test sets for machine translation system evaluation  . Therefore , they include a hnost of all linguislic phenomena flu  , l the systems have to process . 
In lhcslandards , the double-subjecte on slruclion is listed as one of the conslruclions lhat arc difficult lo proces successfidly  . 
Many Japmles ephilologists have sludic dthc double -subject construction because it is necessary to reveal the synlaclic or scmmltic structure of lhis construction if w care to establish a syntactic or sem~ulliclheo ~  , lor the Japanese language ( lshigami , 1977) ( Kuno , 1973) ( Mikami ,  1961)) . However , the rear cafew sludies for processing this conslmction from lhepoint of view of computational linguislics or engineering  ( Mttrala ,  1990) . ~llmrel brc , lhcaim of lhispaper is to discuss a melhod for ; malyzing lhcJapanese double-subject constnlction havhlg an adjective predicate from lhepoint of view of engineering  . 
2 Definition of key terms
Key terms used in this paper medefined as follows : ? case-marldng particle In English  , each case is marked by its relative posilion in terms of tile predicate or by a preposition  . In contrast to lhis , Japanese language marks each case by a certain sort of postposilional parlicle located next to noun phvase sudlas " ga " or " we "  . Such particles arc call cd " case-markiug pm-ticl es "  . 
? adverbial particle " Adverbial particles " give a case an additional function  ( topicalizalion etc . ) by their all achmenl to Ibccasc-marking parlicle . Some adverbial particle such as " wa " or " me " often stand-in for case-marking parlicles and give the case  ; m additional fimclion . 
? sentence having an adjective predicate In the Japanese I~mguage  , adjectives function as predicates in sentences as do verbs  , qlmrefore , in this paper , lhe sentence in which m ~ adjective acts as a predicate is called a " senlence having an Mieclive predicate "  . 
. double-sul ; jeet construction
Usually , a simple sentence has only one subjeclivccase . t to wev cr , m ~ my Japanese adjeclives ( and some a simple sentence . Such sentence structure is called tile " double -subject on strnction "  . This constn~ction includes both adverbial particle " wa " and subjective case-marking p ~ trticle " ga "  . Therefore , the Japanese double-subject on struction is also referred to as file " wa " -" ga " construction  . 
? valency structure
The sentence structure can be considered as a combination of a predicate and its modifiers  . Such sentence stntcturc is called the " valency structure "  . 
The valency structure represents what surface cases the modifiers dominated by a given predicate correspond to  . 
? valency pattern " Valency patterns " are stnlcture patterns that formulate possible valency structures for predicates  . A valency pattern is defined for each usage for each predicate  . 
Figure 1 shows an example of a valency pattern for a verb " shouka is unl  ( introduce ) " . For vcrbs and adjectives , wdcncy patterns formulated as shown in figure 1 are collected beforehand in the dictionary called the valency pattern dictionary  .

? valency element
In the valency stn ~ cture , each relation between a predicate and its modifier is called a " valency element "  . 
As shown in figure I , valency elements are described using both the semantic restriction on the noun including the modifier and the restriction on the case-marking pmaicles including the modifier  . 
? sentence analysis ( or analyzing a sentence ) " Sentence analysis " is the process that reveals the valency structure of the input sentence  . ALT-J/E perfonn sentence analysis by binding the modifiers for the predicate in the input sentence to the valency elements in the wtiency pattern for the predicate in the wdency pattern dictionary  . 
? semantic ategory
A " semantic ategory " is a class for dividing nouns into concepts according to their meaning  . For example , both " man " and " woman " belong to the same semantic category \ [  ( human ) \] . In the below , the words surrounded by 1 (   ) \] are semantic categories . 
3 Japanese Sentence Analysis based on the valency structure Figure  2 outlines the translation process in ALT-J/E ( Hayashi ,  1987) . Morphological naly si segment she input Japanese sentence into its component words such as predicates and nouns  . Dependency analysis determines the dependency structure to indicate the association between words  . From the association between a predicate and its modifiers in the dependency structure  , sentence analysis tries to determine the wflency strncture  , i . e . , it determines , for the valency pattern for the predicate , which valency element ead ~ modifier corresponds to  . This valency stnlcture is then converted into the equivalent English sentence structure  . Finally , the outpnt English sentence is generated from the stnlcture  .

Figure 2 . Outline of translation process in ALT-J/E , The following describes how ord in tu'y sentences are analyzed by ALT-J/E using the valency structure for the predicate of file input sentence  . 
Sentence analysis is the process that converts the dependency structure into filevalency structure by referring towdency patterns  . All valency patterns for each usage with each predicate are prepared beforehand and held in the valency pattern dictionary  . . As shown in figure 1 , for each predicate , both file semantic restriction on a noun including its modifier and file restrictions on case-marking particles including its modifier are described for each valency element  . When the modifier in the input sentence satisfies both restrictions for a certain wllency element in the valency pattern for the predicate  , the modifier is botm d to that valency element . The valency smlctnre is determined by binding all predicate modifiers to valency elements  . 
An adverbial particle can correspond to more than one case-marking pataicle  , for example , " wa " is a possible proxy for " ga " , " wo " , " hi " and so on . Therefore , sentence analysis first tries to bind modifiers that have case-marking particles  , each of which represents which case is unambiguously marked by particle spelling like " ga "? morphological nalysis and dependency analysis dependency structure  . ~ refer to valency pattern sentence analysis as ordinary construction ~ r valelley strilt ' lll'e  ( -J  ~ ( ~ Ji " " I-% ( pastense )  --'~' )   . , , -"-~_ ( introduce) . . . . ~ C ( st , bjective case ) < ctive casel ) ~( i objective cas ; ~ Figure 3 .

Figure 3 shows an example of this type of Japanese sentence mmlysis for the sent cncc"k are wa watashinikate noimou to we shoukaishita  ( he the educed his sister to me ) " . First , them mlysis tries to bind modifiers with case-tam ' king parlicles " we " and " ni " to tilewdency elements in the wdency pattern for the predicate " shoukaisent  ( introduce ) " which is oblain cdI Yomlh cvalency pattem dictionary  . As modifiers satisfy bolh restrictions on the noun memfing and case-marking parlicles  , they , are bound to N2 ( objective case 1 ) midN3 ( objective case 2 )  , respectively . The ~ malys is then l fies to bind lhemodifier with adverbial particle " wa " to a non-bound valency element  . So far ,   N2 and N3 in the wflcncypaltem have already been bound . 
Therefore , as shown in figure 3 , the only non-bound valency element is N1 which is a subjective case . The adverbial particle " wa " c~m stand-in for case-marking p ~ wticlc " ga "  , which is the non-bound w fiency clcment , mid the noun " km-e ( he ) " satisfies the scmantic restriction on the subjcctive case  N1 i . e . \[( agent )\] . 
Therefore , file modifier with " wa " is bonndtotim subjective case  N1  . Finally , lh cvalency structure as shown in figure 3 is obtained . 
4 Processing the Japanese double-subject construction Many Japmmse adjective predicates dom hmtc two subjective cases and so form the double-subject construction  . The double-subject on stmctiou having an Miective predicate actually has several wlrimlts  , so no one approach c , ' m be uscd to mlalyze it . Accordingly , this section classifies the four types mid the characteristics of eadltype ~' e described  . 
4 . 1 Classification of the Japanese dnuble-subjcet construction Tile Japanese doublc-subj cct on smlction  ( also calicO the " wa " -" ga " conslruction ) can be classified into lhefollowing four types based on a previous study  ( lshigami , 1977): ? type-IIn this vafi ~ mt , adverbial particle " wa " is a proxy for a case -marking particle such as " ni " other than subjective case-ram-king " ga "  .   Example1 shows " wa " as a proxy for case-marking particle " hi " intile sentence " wamshinoie wagakkou gachikai  ( file school is nearmy house ) "  . 
Example-1 ( my house )   ( adverbial ( school )   ( case-marking ( nea0pro'title"wa " ) particle " ga " ) ~1?" wa " is\[br"ni " . proxy ( my housc )   ( destination ( school )   ( subjective ( hem ' ) case-marking case-marking particle"ni " ) pmticle " ga " ) ? type 2 in this wu'iant , adverbial parlicle " wa " is a proxy for case -umrking panicle " no " representing a noun modifier  ( prenominal )  .   Example-2 shows " wa " as a proxy for prenominal case -marking p ~ ulicle " no " in the sentence " zouw a hamg an agai  ( elc plumls have long trunks ) " . In this wu-itm I , the case of " wa " modifying a predicate must be analyzed as " no " modifying the dependency structure ~  ( subjective ) JR : 7~ /F @@ ~ Ni : Label ~ bravalency element refer to valency pattern SR : Semantic restriction on a noun on case-marking pazticles  .

case with subjective case-marking particle " ga".
Therefore , this analysis involves re-formation of the valency structure  . 
Exam lfle-2 ( elephant )   ( adverbial 0 rose )   ( case-marking ( long ) particle " wa " ) particle " ga " ) ~?" wa " is proxy for " no " . 
(elephant )   ( prenominal ( nose )   ( subjective ( long ) case-marking case-marking particle " no " ) particle " ga " ) ? type 3In this variant , the case with case-marking particle " ga " sometimes represents ~ m objective case  . Allhough an objective case is usually marked by case-marking particle " wo "  , some adjective predicates have a noNective case marked by case-marking particle " ga "  . 
Example-3 shows that " kanojo ( she ) " with " ga " is an objective case and " k are ( he ) " with " wa " is a subjective case in the sentence " karewakano jog as nkida  ( he likes her ) " . As case-marking particle " ga " normally indicates the subjective case  , binding " ga " to the subjective case leads to incorrect m mlys is if if only surface spelling is considered  . 
Exam lfle-3 ( he )   ( adve Nial ( her )   ( case-marking ( like ) particle " wa " ) particle " ga " )  ?  , ,  , , "  , a " rercsen Ls ? " r ~ roxy tor ~ a . g , P . . Pwa " lS ~ ~ ~ V all oDjecuve case ~ ( subjective ( her )   ( objective ( like )   ( he ) case-marking case-marking particle " ga " ) particle " wo " ) ? type 4In this variant , the case with adverbial particle " wa " acts as all adverbial phrase representing time and is actually a special form of  type1  . Representing time is optional for most predicates  . Moreover , Japm ~ esetime expressions are often translated into English adverbial phi'ases  . Therefore ,   type4 is separated from type1 in this classification from viewpoint of enghmering  . 
Example-4 shows that time expression "6-gatsu wa ( in Jmle ) " acts as an adverbial phrase in the sentence "6-gatsu waamegatot ( it has much rain in June ) " . 
Example -4 ( June )   ( adverbial ( rain )   ( case-marking ( ninth )  ~ ( t particle " wa " ) particlc " ga " ) ime expression with " wa " acts as an adverbial phrase  ( June )   ( rain )   ( subjective ( much )   ( adverbial case-marking phrase ) particle " ga " )  4 . 2 Problems in processing the Japanese double -subject construction Type-I and  type4 cases can be analyzed using the processing flow described in section  3 because adverbial particle " wa " simply acts as a case-marking particle  . However , the following problems , arise when processing type2 and type3 cases in the normal way . 
? Problem with type 2 cases
Fignre 4 shows them ~ alys is of the type 2 example , " zouwahanaganagai ( elephanls have long thinks ) " . 
The predicate " nagai ( long ) " has only one valency element N1 with " ga " . According to ordinary sentence analysis , the modifier " hanaga " is bound to the valency element NI  , which means that the other modifier " zouwa " is left unbound  . That is , sentence analysis camlot be completed as shown in the left bottom of figure  4  . 
This complicates the accurate Wanslation of this modifier into English  .

? ProMem with type 3 cases
Figure 5 shows the analysis of sentence analysis of the type3 example , " karewak~mqiogasukida(helikesher ) " . If modifiers with a case-marking parlicle are preferentially processed as described in seclion  3  , then the modifier with " ga " binds to subjective case  N1 which is wrong in this example . This leads us lolhewrong interpretation as shown in lheleft bottom of figure  5  . 
5 Proposed method for analyzing Japanese double -subject construction In order to overcome lhe problems described in the previous section  , this section proposes a method for analyzing a Japanese double-subject conslmction having m ~ adjective predicate  . The mefl ~ od hasfll recprocessing phases . The first determines whether lh c input sentence has double-subject construction or not  .

Earl processing phase is described below in detail with reference to figure  6  . 
? Judgment of dou Me-subject construction If the input sentence contains two modifiers that have adverbial particle " wa " mid case-tam'king particle " ga "  , it is determined as a double-subject on stnmtion .

well as sentences with verb predicates , are processed normally as described ill section 3 . 
? Type determination
First ,   lype-4 is set if the modifier with adverbial parlicle " wa " represents a time expression or not  . T iffs is efficient because type4 is the most specific type . This judgment is performed by checking whether the semantic calegory of the noun included in the modifier with " wa " is associated with \[  ( time ) \] or not . Second ,   type3 is set by the valency paltem for the predicate in lh ? input  . The predicate in a type3 case has to cover valency pattern for each usage for each predicate is defined in the valency pattern dictionary  . Therefore , this judgment is performed by checking whether the valency pattern for the predicate includes both a subjcctive case and an objective case  . Finally ,   type1 and type2 are differentiated according to the result of binding betw ccn the modifiers in the input senteuce and the valency elements in the valency pattern  .   Type2 is set ff the modifier with case-marking particle " ga " is bound to the subjective case and the modifier with adverbi ~ dparticle " wa " is not  . The remaining cases are judged as type 1 . Here , modifiers with " wa " and " ga " , are often bound in type 1 . Notice that the binding process resolves what case-marking parlicle the adverbial particle " wa " st and s-in for  . 
? Determining the valency structure
In the type 4 preprocessing step in figure 6 , the modifier with " wa " ( time reference ) is considered as an adverbial plwase . Next , binding the other modifiers with the valency elements in the valency pattern for the prcdicate is attcmpted  . This facilitates the translation of Japanese time expressions into English  . 
In the type 3 prc processing step in figure 6 , case-marking particle " ga " has to be converted into the case-marking particle " wo " before binding the former which represents an objective case  . This conversion allows us to correctly bind each modifier to its appropriate valency element  , be can se predicates in type3 cases have both a subjective case with " ga " and an objective case with " wo "  . See the example in the right bottom of fignre 5 . 
In type 2 processing , adverbial particle " wa " is a proxy for prenominal case-marking particle " no " and the modifier with adverbial particle " wa " must be analyzed as the phrase which modifies the snbjective case with " ga "  . As a result ,   type2 mmlys is involves changing the valency structure . In figure 4 , the noun phrase " zouno hana " is for nled from both " zou  ( elcphant ) " with " wa " and " hzma 0 lose ) " with " ga " by converting " wa " into " no " , and " zouno hana " is bound to the subjective case for the predicate " nagai  ( long ) " . 
See the example in the right bottom of figure 4.
Moreover ,   type2 processing tries to determine the semantic relation between the noun with " ga " and the noun with " no "  ( originally " wa " )  . Determining the semmltic relation helps us translate he Japanese double-subject construction into the appropriate English construction ad expression  . Although several semantic relations are known , at the present time ALT-J/E can resolve only two of them based on semantic categories : has-a relation and is a relation  . 
As adverbial particle " wa " in type-I cases is a proxy for a case-marking particle such as " ni "  , " de " and so on , type-I cases can be processed in the way described in section  3  . 
The above approach con'ectly determines die input sentence's valency structure which allows the maddnetranslation system to produce more accurate output  . 
As a result , the method proposed here improves the translation accuracy of ALT-J/E  . 
6 Conclusion
This paper has proposed a method for analyzing the Japanese double-subject on struction that includes an adjective predicate  . This paper has classified the construction i to four  . types and described problems when applying the ordinary sentence analysis to the four types  . The algorithm that overcomes these problems has been explained in detail  . 
This method has been applied to Japanese sentence analysis in ALT-J/E  . Because this method caucorrectly analyze the double-subject on struction  , the method helps the translation of this constrnction into an appropriate English construction  .
