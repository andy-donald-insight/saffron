Parsing along sentence is very difficult , since long sentences often have conjunctions which result in ambiguities  . If the conjunctive structures existing in a long sentence can be analyzed correctly  , ambiguities can be reduced greatly and a sentence can be parsed in a high successful rate  . Since the prior part and the posterior part of a conjunctive structure have a similar structure very often  , finding two similar series of words is an essential point in solving this problem  . 
Similarities of all pairs of words are calculated and then the two series of words which have the greatest sum of similarities are found by a technique of dynamic programming  . We deal with not only conjunctive noun phrases , but also conjunctive predicative clauses created by " Renyoh chuushi-ho "  . We will illustrate the effectiveness of this method by the analysis of  180 long Japanese sentences . 
1 Introduction
Analysis of along Japanese sentence is one of many difficult problems which cannot be solved by the continuing efforts of many researchers and remain a bau-doned  . It is difficult to get a proper analysis of a sentence whose length is more than fifty Japanese characters  , and almost all the analyses fail for sentences composed of more than eighty characters  . To clarify why it is is also very difficult because there are varieties of reasons for the failures  . People sometimes say that there are so many possibilities of modi-fier/modifyee relations between phrases in a long sentence  . But no deeper consideration has ever been given for the reasons of the analysis failure  . Analysis failure here means not only that no correct analysis is included in the multiple analysis results which are caused by the intrinsic ambiguity of a sentence and also by inaccurate grammatical rules  , but also that the analysis fails in the middle of the analysis  pro-re88  , We have been claiming that many ( more than two ) linguistic omponents are to be seen at the same time in a sentence for proper parsing  , and also that tree to tree transformation is necessary for reliable analysis of a sentence  . Popular gramma rules which merge two linguistic components into one are quite insufficient to describe the delicate relationships among component sill along sentence  . 
Language is complex . There often happens that components whicb are far a part in a long sentence cooccur  , or have certain relationships . Such relations may be sometimes purely semantic , but often they are grammatical or structural , although they are not definite but very subtle . 
Along sentence , particularly of Japanese , contains parallel structures very often . They are either conjunctive noun phrases , or conjunctive predicative clauses . The latter is called " Renyoh chuushi-ho " . They appear in an embedded sentence to modify nouns  , and also are used to connect wo or more sentences  . This form is very often used in Japanese , and is a main cause for structural ambiguity . Many major sentential components are omitted in the posterior part of Renyohchuushi expressions and this makes the analysis more difficult  . 
For tbc successful analysis of along Japanese sentence  , these parallel phrases and clauses , including Renyoh chuushi-ho , must be recognized correctly . 
This is a key point , and this must be achieved by a completely different method from the ordinary syntactic analysis methods  , because they generally fail in the analysis for a long sentence  . 
We have introduced au assumption that these parallel phrases/clauses have a certain similarity  , and have developed an algorithm which finds out a most plausible two series of words which can be considered parallel by calculating a similarity measure of two arbitrary series of words  . This is realized by using the dynamic programming method  . The results was exceedingly good . We achieved the score of about 80% in the detection of various types of parallel series of words in long Japanese sentences  . 
2 Types of Conjunctive Structures and Their Ambiguities First  , we will explain what kind of conjunctive structures  ( hereafter abbreviated as ' CS ' ) appear in
Japanese\[l\]N .
The first type is conjunctive no miphrases . We ACRESDE COLING-92 , NAN'r ~ , 2328 AOU'r 1992170 PROC . OFCOLING-92, NANTES , AUO .  2328 ,   1992 ' l ' alfle 1: Wards indicating conjunctive structures .

can find these phrases by tile words for conjunction listed up in Table l  ( a )  . Each conjunctive noun sometimes has adjectival modifiers  ( Table 2 ( i l ) ) or clause modifiers ( Table 2 ( iii ) ) . 
The second type is conjunctive predicative c lauses  , ill which two or more it redicates ~ arc in a sentence forming a coordination  . We call find these clauses by the ll , enyoh-lbrnts ~ of predicates ( Renyo he huushi-ho : Table 2 ( iv ) ) or by tile predi .

We can find these structures by the correspondence of p  ( xst positional particles ( Table 2 ( vi ) ) or by the words in Table l ( e ) which indicate CSs explicitly ( Table 2 ( vii ) ) . 
l , brall of these types , it is relatively easy to tind the existence of a CS by detecting a distinctive keybml sets u a  ( we call this bunsetsu ' KB' ) which ac-companies these words explained above . KB lies last in the prior part of at CS , but it is difficult to determine which bunsetsu sequences on both side of tile KB constitute a CS  . That is , it is not easy to determine which Imn sets u to tile hfft of a KII is tile leftmost element of the prior part of a CS  , and which bunsetsu to the . right of a Kilistile rightmost element of the posterior part of a US  . The bunsetsus betweeu these two extreme elements constitute the scope of the CS  . Particularly in detecting this scope of a CS , it is essential to find out the last Imn sets n in the posterior part of the CS  , which corresponds to the KB . q ' hereart ' . ln any candidates for it illase a tence ; e . g .   , illa conjunctive noun i ) hras ~ all nouns after it KII are the candidates .

We detect the scope of CSs by using wide range of information around it KB  .   4 An input sentence is first divided into bunsetsus by tile conventional morphological analysis  . Then we calculate similarities of all pairs of ~ ) unsets usillase lltence , and calculate a sum of similarities between a series of bunsetsus on the left of a KII and a series of bunsetsus on the left of a CB  . Of all the pairs of the two series of Imnsetsus , the pair which has the greatest sum of similarities is determined as the scope of the CS  . We wilt explaint in s process in detail in the following  . 
3 . 1 S imi la r i t ies between Bunsetsus An appropriate similarity value between bunsetsus is given by the following process  . 
? If the parts of speech of IWs ( independent words ) are equal , giw ~2_j > oints as the similarity values . 
Then go to the next stage and add further the following I  ) oints . 
1 . If IWs match exactly ( by characterlevel ) each other , add 10 points and skip the next two steps and go totile step  4  . If lWs are inflected , infinitives are compared . 
2 . If both IWs are nouns and they match partially by characterlevel  , ad<l the number of match in ~ characters x 2 \] mints .

3 . Add points for semantic similarities by using the thesaurus ' Buurui Goi Ityou '  ( BGH ) \[3\] . 
BGH has the six layer abstraction hierarchy and more than  60  , 000 words are assigned to the leaves of it . If the most specific common layer between two IWs is the kth layer and if k is greater than  2  , add ( k-2) ?2 points . If either or both IWs are not contained in BGH , no addition is made . Matching of the generic two layers are ignored to prevent too vague matching in broader sense  . 
4 . If some of AWs ( accompanying words ) matcb , add the number of match in $ AWs x3 points . 
Maximum sum of the similarity values which can be added by the steps  2 and 3 above is limited to 10 points . 
? Although the parts of speech of lWs are not equal  , give 2_ . points if both bunsetsus can be predicate ( see footnote 1 )  . 
For example , the similarity point between " ~ ~ Pi ~ ( low level language )  + , " and "~ lt ? , ~ '~  ( high level language )  + ~  ( and ) " is calculated as 2 ( match of parts of speech )  + 8 ( match of four characters : Y ~ l/t ~ ~ ) = 10 points . The point between " ~\] ' aq ~ ( revision ) + L ( do )  + , " and " l~U3 ( deteetion ) +' J - ~ ( do ) " is 2 ( match of parts of speech )  + 2 ( match by BGII )  + 3 ( match of one AWs ) -7 points . 
3.2 Similarities between Two Series of

Our method etects the scope of a CS by two series of bunaetsus which have the greatest similarity  . These two aeries of bunsetsus are searched for on a triangu-larmatrix A =  ( a ( i , j )) ( Figure 1) , whose diagonal element a(i , i ) is the ith bunsetsu in a sentence and whose element a  ( i , j )   ( i < j ) is the similarity value between bunsetsu a ( i , i ) and bunsetsu a(j , j ) . 
We call the rectangular matrix A ' a partial ma - trix  , where A ' = ( a(i , j )) ( O < i < n ; n + l < j < 1) t , ( i ,  ~3~  . . . . . . . . . . i'---~i , j-I )-~ i , 9 " J . . . . . Iii \ , ( . . ni i i %

Figure 3: Penalty points.
is the upper right part of a KB ( Figure 1) . In tile following , 1 indicates the number of bunsetsus and a(n , n ) is a KB . We define a path as a series of elements from a nonzero element in the lowest row to an element in the leftmost column of a partial matrix  ( Figure 1 )  . 
path : := ( a(pl,m ), a(p2 .   .   .   .  1)  .   .   .   .   . a(p .   .   .   .   . +1)), where n + l < m < 1, a(pl , m ) ? O , Pi = n ,
PI > >. PI+I(1 < i < m-n-1).
The starting element of a path shows the correspondence of a KB to a CB  . A path has only one element from eacb column and extends towards the upper left  . 
We calculate the similarity between tbeseries of bunsetsus on the left side of the path  ( sbl in Figure 1 ) and the series under the path ( sb2 in Figure 1 ) as a path score by the following four criteria : 1  . Basically the score of a pathistile sum of each element's points on the path  . But if a part of the path is horizontal ( a ( i , j ) , a(i , j-1)) as shown in Figure 2 , which leads the bunsetsu correspondence of one element a  ( i , i ) to two elements a(j-1 , j-1) and a(j , j ) , the element's points a(i , j-1) is not added to the path score . 
2 . Since a pair of conjunctive phrases/clanses often appear ~ s a similar structure  , it is likely that both cmdunctive phrases/clauses contain nearly the same numbers of bunsetsus  . Therefore , we impose penalty points on the pair of elements in the path which causes the one-to-plural bunsetsu correspondence so as to give a priority to the CS of the same size  .

Timpenal t , y points are subtracted from the path score . 
3 . Since each phrase in the CS has a certain cO -herency of meaning  , speciM words which separate the meaning in a sentence often limit the scope of a CS  . If a path includes such words , we impose penalty points on the path so that the fmssihil-ity of including those are reduced  . We define five'separating-levels' ( SLs ) for hunsetsus , which express the strength of separating a sentence meaning  ( Table 3 , of . Tahle 1) . If bunsetsus on the left side of the path ~ md under it include a bunsetsu whose SL is equal to KB's SI  , or higher than it , we reduce the path score by ( SL of the hunsetsu-KB's SL+1 ) x7 . 
l to wever , two high SL bunsetsus corresponding to each other of teu exist in a CS  , and those do not limit the scope of the CS . For example , topic-marking postpositional particles correspond each other in the following sential style  , h  ~ . L'C ~ ( AstoA) .   .   .   . -cab9(be ), f~~L~c~(~sto~l) .   .   .   . - c . ~(~ e ) . 
Therefore , when two high SL bunsetsus correspond in a CS , that is , the path includes the element which indicates the similarity of them  , and those are the ' same-type ' , the penalty points on them arc not axlded to tile path score  . We define thc same-type bunsetsus ~ LS two bunsetsus which satisfy the following two conditions  . 
? IWs of them are of the same part of speech , and they have the identical inflection wh cn they arc inflectional words  . 
? AWs of them arc identical.

~ll~tA-tA~(~Josjultctive noun phrases 4 . Some words frequently become tile AW of the last bunsetsu in a CS or the IW following it  . These words thus signal the end of the CS . Such words are shown in Table 4 , Bonuspoints ( 6 points ) are given to the path which indicates the CS ending with one of the words in Table  4  , as that paths houhlhepreferred .

4 Experiments and Discussion
We illustrate the effectiveness of our method by the analysis of  180 Japanese sentences .   60 sentences which are longer aud more complex than the average sentences are collected from each of the following three sources  ; Encyclopedic Dictionary of Computer Science ( EDCS ) published by lwanami Publishing Co . , Abstracts of papers of Japan Information Center of Science and Technology  ( JICST )  , and popular science journal , " Science " , translated into Japanese ( Vol . 17,No . 12" Advanced Computing for Science ") . 
Each group of 60 sentences consists of 20 sentences from 30 to 50 characters , 20 sentences from 50 to 80 characters , and 20 sentences over 80 characters . 
As described in the preceding sections , many factors have effects on the analysis of CSs , and it is very important o adjust the weights for each factor  . The method of calculating the path score was adjusted during the experiments on  30 sentences out of 60 sentences from EDCS . Then the other 150 sentences are analyzed by these parameters . As the analyses were successful as shown in the following  , this method can be regarded as properly representing the balanced weights on each factor  . 
This method defines where the CS ends , that is , which bunsetsu corresponds to the KB . However , as for conjunctive noun phrases containing clause modifiers or conjunctive predicative clauses  , it is almost impossible to find out exactly where the CS starts  , because mm~y bunsetsus which modify righthand bunsetsus exist in each part of the CSs and usnally they do not correspond exactly  . Thus it is necessary to revise the starting position of the CS obtained by this method  . We treat the actual prior part of a CS as extending to bunsetsus which modify a bunsetsu in the prior part of it obtained by this method  , unless they contain comma or topic-marking postpositional particle "  #2  " ( ha )  .

In the case of example ( a ) in Figure 6 , the conjunctive noun phrase , in which eight nouns are conjuncted ( chains of %' , ' b ' ,   .   .   .

In the case of example ( b ) in Figure 7 , the CS which consists of three noun phrases containing modifier clauses is detected a stile combination of the two consecutive CSs like example  ( a )   ( chain of ' a ' and ' b' )  . 
In tile case of example ( c ) ill Figure 8 , the conjunctive noun phrase and the conjunctive predicative clause containing it is analyzed rightly  . In this example , the successful analysis is due to the penalty points by SL of the topic-marking postpositional particle " " in " ~ ff ~ g~l ~ rl~t  ( a computationale ~: periment ) " and " , ~1~  ( in that ) " which are the outside of tile CS and the bonus points by the AW"~v  , 5" in the last bunsetsu of the CS .

4.2 Experinaental Evaluation
We evaluated tile analysis result of 180 Japanese sentences by hand . The results of cvaluatluge very sentence by each CS type are shown in Table  5  . If tile same typcCSs exist two or more illa sentence  , the analysis is regarded as a success only when all of them are analyzed rightly  . 
There arc 144 conjunctive noun phrases ill 180 sentences , and ll9 phrases among them are analyzed rightly . T be success ratio is 83% . There are 118 conjunctive predicative clauses ill 180 sentences , and 94 clauses among them are analyzed rightly . The success ratio is 80% . There are 3 pairs of the conjunctive incomplete structures , and all of them are analyzed rightly . 
As show u in \]' able 5 , the sucecssrate fortile Sell-tences from J1CST abstracts arc worse than that of the sentences from other sources  . The reason for the failures is that tile sentences are often very ambiguous and confusing even for alluman because they have too many contents in a sentence to satisfy the limitation of tile do cnment size  . 
4 . 3 Examples o f Incor rect Ana lys i s and Solut ions for Them W c give examples of failure of analysis  ( Table 6 , Fig-urc9) , and indicates t ) lutions for them . In Table 6, underlined parts show the KBs , I- .   .   . d show stile wrongly analyzed scope , and r . . . j shows the right scope . 
? It is essential il this method to define the appropriate similarity between words  . Thus changing the sinlilarity points for more detailed groups of parts of speech  ( e , g . nouns call be divided into ilul ~ lerals ~ proper nonns  , conlmon nouns , and action nouns which be comc verbs by the combiua-tion with "~- ~  ( do ) " ) can improve the accuracy of the anMys is . For example , the example ( i ) in ' Fable 6 mayb canalyzed rightly if the similarity points between action noun "  t1~\[~   ( extension ) " and action noun " t ~' f ( maintenance ) " is greater than that between action noun " t1 ~ ( extension ) " and common noun " ~1 ~ ( di ~ cully ) "  . 
? Semantic similarities between words are currently calculated only by using BO Il which do not contain technical terms  . If tiles in filarity points between technical terms can be given by thesaurus  , tile accuracy of tile analysis will be improved . 
Example ( ii ) will be analyzed rightly if greater points are given to tile similarity between " TP " T  4   7"  . -k 4 . -- b~f ~' ~ ( Actlve Chart Parsing ) " and " llPSG ( Head-drtve , Phrase Structure Gram-illy the additional usage of relatively simple syntactic conditions  , some sentences which are analyzed wrongly by this method will be analyzed rightly  . For example , because Japanese modi-fier/modifyee relations , inchnling the relation between a verb and its case frame elements  , do noter c~s each other , the modifier/modify eer-lations in nm phrases and predicative clauses do not spread beyond each phrase or clause  , except the relation concerning the last bunsetsu of them  . 
This condition is not satisfied by the analyzed CS in the example  ( ill ) whose prior noun phrase contains no verb related with the case frame element " ~  , ~" ( grammar ) " . By this condition it can be ~-~- timated that only "   17~1/~\   [0   ( natural langlage ) MI ~ ~ ( analysis and ) " or " ~ i : ~: ( analysis and ) " AODdSDr COLING-92 , NANTES , 2328 hOt~T199217$PROC .

can be the prior part of the CS . We are planning to do such a correction in the next stage of the syntactic analysis  , which analyzes all modi-fier/modifyee relations in a sentence using the CS scopes detected by this method  . 
? in example ( iv ) , the KB in the beginning part of a sentence corresponds to the last CB  . That is , a short part of a sentence corresponds to the following long part  . It is very difficult to analyze such an extremely unbalanced CS because this method gives a priority to similar CSs  . In order to analyze example ( iv ) the causal relationship between "~1~-9" C ( usiug ) " and "~ tr ~' J ~ z ~ ( create ) " will be necessary . 
? Some sentences analyzed incorrectly are too subtle even for a human to find the right CSs  . Exam-pie ( v ) cannot be analyzed rightly without expert knowledge  . 
? This method cannot handle the CSs in which the prior part contain some modifiers and the posterior part contains nothing corresponding to them  ( example ( vi )  , Figure 9) . For these structures we must think the path extending upward in a partial matrix  , but it is impossible by the criteria about word similarities alone  . 
The CSs such as example ( v ) and example ( vi ) cannot be analyzed correctly without semantic informs-tion  . f Iowever such expressions are very few in actual text  . 
5 Concluding Remarks
We have shown that varieties of parallel structures in Japanese sentences can be detected by the method explained in this paper  . As the result , a long sentence can be reduced into a short one , and the success rate of syntactic analysis of these long sentences will bc-come very high  . 
There are still some conjunctive x pressions which cannot be recognized by the proposed method  , and we are tempted to rely on semantic information to get proper analyses for these remaining cases  . Semantic information , however , is not so reliable as syntactic information , and we have to make further efforts to find out syntactic rather than semantic relations in these difficult cases  . We think that it is possible . One thing which is certain is that we have to see many more components simultaneously in a wider range of word strings of a loug sentence  .
