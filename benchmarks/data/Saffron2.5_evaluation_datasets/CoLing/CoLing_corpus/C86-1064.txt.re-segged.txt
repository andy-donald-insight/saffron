We intend to present in this paper a parsing method of French language whose particularities are : a multilevel approach : syntax and morphology working simultaneously  , the use of string pattern matching and the absence of dlcUonary  . We want here to evaluate the feasibility of the method rather than to present an operationnal system  . 
I Generale biectives;
We intend to demonstrate that it is possible to parse texts with very few data : on lv  determil2~  . ~ j3_ts , indefinite and numeral a diectives , con ! unction & o , ndr ) reDositions , that in such an analysis , the consecutive application of morphology and syntax is insufficient  , but that the use of . ~ YJ3 . t ? ~ and m_gr ~ gysimultaneously is very efficient , end at last that the notion of a grammatical or lexical category of the word is not attached to the word  , but deoends on the local situation of the word in the senten ~  . .~ . 
/I Commen_~_U.p~n objectives_:
A . Comparison with the classical parsing strategies : In nearly every contemporary automatic parsing system  , we have a chronology of several steps , one step by linguistic level : the moroholoeical ste Q  , then the . & yntactical ~; tep , and then eventually the semantic ? zt_O . .E . The morphological step uses an exhaustive dictionary of forms or sometimes of lamin as  . 
But we know that the human understanding uses simultaneous information coming from all levels  . Some parsers now begin to use two levels simultaneously : for example the system ASCOF  ( SFBt00 Sarrebrt 3ck , see reference ) uses semantic information coming from semantic nets in the syntactical analysis and semantic constraints in the syntactical rules  . 
We propose to use morphology and syntax simultaneously in a parser with no dictionary  . 
B . Assumptions and the orl cal aspect :
By " parsing " we mean to Lg . .q . 0 _gj3j ? ~ adjectives and nouns with their gender and number  , verbs in the infinitive or in the present participle and the adverbs derived from adjectives  , to Erg ~ the lexicon of the text and to ~ Lel . ez ?\[\]/ ~ syntactical relations between words . 
The \[ oossible al~Dfications of such a parser are : automatic indaxation  , and also as a first step in every system which uses a parser : inquiry system  , automatic translation , filling knowledge bases from texts , etc . . . . particularly when the parser must work in open semantics  . 
The main practical interests are to avoid consult in o an exhaustive In the first step of the parsing and to Process the neolooisms exactly the same wav as the other words  . Dictionaries are expensive to and in fact are never completely updated  ; consulting a dictionary produces many artefact -ambiguities  , locally to the word , which are cancelled as soon as the immediate context is examined  ; these ambiguities produce a combination-explosion admuch redundant processing  . 
There are also some theorical aspects . If the Jg . EJ_q . ~ category can be deduced with no dictionary , is this category really lexicel ? We could rather name it a context g  . .~ or ~ category or even a ~\[ D_qJLOJ3 . : a word gets its category from the flow of the text and the dictionary gives the categories  . The ~ category then is only there oul arit v of the function  . 
Further , any word can potentially h ~ we any category ( perhaps more in English than in French )  . Claude Hag 6ge : " cosent des ~ . O  ~ . tJg . ~ , nondesparties cludis cours , qu ' il convient d ' a bord deposer " ( L ' homme deparoles 1985 page 137 )  . A more general theorical aspect lies in the use of computer as an experimental tool which allows now to consider linguistics as an experimental science and to use the experimental method to test linguistic theories  . 
III The mean _ ~:
A , General method:
The main method is pattern matching . The principle is the following : the to recognize is compared to ~ set of patt or r  , c , until a match is found . 
But what exactly is a . ~ in a natural anguage ? The classical terms are " mg  . E~&\[9 . gJL " for the word , and "& VJ 3 . t 6~" for the sentence . We could say that morphology is the shape of the word and syntax the shape of the sentence  ; and more , we propose here to fill conceptually the gap between the level morphology-word and the level syntax-sentence :  4- ~ L . QL a2\[= shape of the text . 
We can also remember that our habit of the ~ Lrj_U , 9 . .D . word properly delimited by spaceser punctuation rnakes us forget that the ~ string is a continuum that we cut while understanding : we use simultaneously morphological  , syntactical , semantic and pragmatical information with which we make deductions  , inferences , deadlocks and use intuition ( about the word see Tesni6 repage 27 , ? 11 to 15) . 
It is possible to classify the pattern matching methods in two categories : the statistic and the structural methods  ( see Miclet and Fu )  . More precisely , we use here a string pattern matching method : every word of the sentence is replaced by its category  , coded by a character , and question marks for unknown words : r#lectricit6   c6r#brale --> d ? ? ( d = determiner ) < the cerebral electricity > maladies mentale set l#sions c #r  #brales --> ? ? c ? ?  ( c = coordination ) < mentaliln esses and cerebrales ions > Let us call this string the pattern by word that will be used in the grammar and in the parsing  , The information used in the parsing is composed of three types of data : a ~  , LELe_~J . ? ~ of the words in finite number ( about ~_0 JLoJLn ~ )  , morphological deduction rules for each word , a set of eatterns of the noun phrase for pattern matching  , and of course the tex Hoana ! vse itself . 
The 1irst steo of this st . u . _d . ? is : lhen oun or ereoositional#hre~g . The following steps are the recognition of these phrases in the sentence  , and the whole parsing of the sentence . 
This work is implemented on Apple Macintosh , and the programming language is Pascal UCSD which is suitable to develop such a parser whose algorithms are rarely recursive  . 
B . The small lexicon:
It contains about 80 forms ( not lemmas ) : determiners ( articles , possessive , demontrative and indefinite adjectives ) , prepositions , coordinations , ome punctuation signs ( considered as words ) . These words are the . a_Eq bPE~g . .D . _qJ . O ~ for pattern matching . 

But we realize that it is impossible to keep the general position to have only the words in finite number in this lexicon  , and that the problem becomes pragmatic : what is the minimum of data necessary to recognize correctly the other words ? We have added the first numeral adjectives  , indefinite adjectives , some very current adjectives often placed before the noun  ( pet it , autre , m~me ) , adverb not derived from adjective ( bien , real , tr~s ) . 
Every form has its possible categories , eventually gender and number ; the list of the possible categories can be open : a form can have another category in a particular sentence : leblenetle real  , leladema clarinette . 
For example , et can be :- conjunction which coordinates adjectives  ( b ) :valour Iocalisatrice et pronostique -->?? b ? < localizing and prognosal value >- conjunction which coordinates noun phrases  ( c ) :maladiesmentale set lSsionsc~rS bralas-->??o ? ? < mentalilln esses and cerebrallesions > - conjunction which coordinates nouns  ( e ) : cr Satione trenouvellement lexicaux --> ? a??< lexical creation and renewing >- conjunction which coordinates prepositional phrases  ( C ) : I ' influence de I ' inductance at de la capacit6 --> d?pd?Opd ? < the influence of inductance and capacity > We have distinguished two categories of preposition according to the " attraction " between the two np : high altraction : lesyst~me d ' unit ~ s < the unit system >  ( sort of compound nouns )  , or low attraction : unchatsurunto it < a cat on a roof >  ( facultative " circumstant " )  , when ce two kinds of prepositional phrases : \[ E \ [ ~ to then p : dl deen  ( o ) or # . ~\[ fim ~ to then p: , ~deen surclans chezvers ( p ) , 
So de can be :- internal preposition ( o ) in : uneth#orie de la morphog#n#se-->d?od ? < a morphogen as is theory > lesyst#med ' unit #s internation nal-->d?o ?? < the international unit system >- external preposition  ( p ) in : deranimal & rhomme --> pd?pd ? < from animal to human >- preposition  ( q ) in : In s diff  #rent smoyens de faire leamesures - -> d ? ? qid ? < the different ways to make measures > 
C . The morphological approach :
Our attitude is to explore all possibilities to extract  , to deduce Information from the mere morpho logy of the word  , without dictionaries , information which can be used ~ t ~ , NV time of the s~For example , lotus observe the words ending with-Ire ) :- icltd-ivit 6-abi/It 6-ibillt 6-ubi/It ( ~- arlt 6-a/lt ~ ; we have a regular alternation adjective/noun : ~ lectr " ~ lg  . ~/6/ectrj?jJ ~, combatjl/combatjyj . ~, portb#L~_/portb#~_t ~, particu/j . ~/ particu/arit ~; from the seendings , we can deduce that the word means a quality ( semantic aspect ) and is a singular feminine noun ( category )  . 
On the semantic opposite , endings as-ification , -isation suggest an action , for example : class'Ej_q_fitj_~comes from the noun class  ( e ) + suffixe-ification , national ~ comes from the adjective national + suffixe-isation  ,   climatisflrLOj2 < air-conditioning > comes from the noun climat + -isation  ; these words have been derived on the same way , with the same semantic aspect : the suffixe-is - + - er  ( verbal ending )  =  . tsaror-is-+-ation ( noun ending ) =- isation has the property to make a verb or a noun which expresses an action  , from adjectives ( national ) or nouns ( cfimat ) ; words ending with-ification or-isation are always feminine nouns  . 
In some cases , at first sight , the morphology does not give reliable information : a word ending by-ement can be an adverb  ( derived from adjective ) or a masculine noun : for example lachement < slackly > is adverb and rel & chement < slackening > masculine noun  , but a more precise study brings the following information : - Scent ==> adverb except  3 roots : agr  #ment compl Sment increment and except the word  #lSnrent  ; -Oment ==> adverb : assid Oment ; -ublement-iblement-ivement==>adverb derived from an adjective : in dissolublement visible menth  #tive ment  ;   . oment . rment-gment ==> noun:moments arment fragment ; -issement-ionnement==>noun derived from a verb : vagissement position nement  , At last , as far as neological production uses these elements and these rules to create new words  , ~ Q . Q . LQg\[ . ~, ZLE  #analysed exactly as the other werd ~( see
Guilbert and Kokourek).
These morphological properties of each word are the second kind of arl chorln ~ nolnt ~ for pattern matching  , 
D . The grammar : 1 . the grammar of the complex noun or prepositional phrase : The phase is considered as a three level hierarchical structure  ( finite number of levels ) : the grammar is not recursive ( on that point joining Tesnlbre and leaving Chomsky  ) : phrase = complex noun or prepositional phrase which is composed of simple noun phrases which are composed of words or "  . & ggJ_uJ\[DE\[#~" words . 
Aoomolex noun D . br . ~ , & e ( cnp ) is : * either a simple noun phrase alone ( G = snp ) -or a train of simple noun phrases separated by : an expernal preposition  ( p = de , clans , pour ) , or a conjunction coordinating sap(c = et , ou ) , or a conjunction coordinating prepositional phrase  ( C = et , ou ) and followed by a preposition ( Cp = et de , ou avac ) , or a preposition preceding an infinitive ( q = de ,  ~ , pour ) or a present participle ( r = - ant ) . 
Theses np have between them relations of subordination or coordination  . 
2 . the grammar of the simple noun phrase : A ~ is a train of words obeying two types of constraints : - ~ Ey  . QL & EEg . .~ , when the phrase agrees with a dependency tree- EI  . OE . QtLQJ QgJ_0~, which is usually named gender . number agreement A . ~# , ttern of as nD is a horizontal Dro ! ection of a sub-etemma of_#  , canonical et emma . Let us remember that as to mma ( word introduced by Tesni~re ) is a dependency tree . The canonical stemma represents an abstract of ~ ~   . 
a sub-stemma is :- either the unchanged canonical stemma  , -or the canonical stemma without a leaf , -or a sub-stemma without a leaf . 
A stemma is a ~ . 9_ ~\[ Lri\]gj\] . ~ ram : the vertical dimension of the hierachical levels and the horizontal dimension of the written words  ; a stemma can be horizontally projected to obtain the one dimensional train of words as they are written  . Here is an example of a possible canonical stemma of the snp  , and its projection :
II dot advady adj noun advadvadjadvadvadj dependency relations : adj  . . . . . . . . . . . > noun(depends on ) projection relations : dot .   .   .   .   . > det ( is projected as ) There is as np pattern for every sub-stemma of the canonical stemma  . The three canonical sternmas now used are equivalent to about  2000 rewriting rules . 
The " agglu Unatlon " rules are applied JZIE\[ . ~  L~312 from right to left and are the bott or a-up aspect of the algorithm :- every adjective can be an agglutinated adjective  ( A ) as the result of the coordination of several adjectives : ? b ? -> ABb ?-> A = =>? = adjectives - in the forms : noun denoun or : noun  , tnoun , we have JAL ~ . ES\[~ositional_phr~e . .~ , working like ~( B ) , which are included in the snp , and processed as . ~ in the parsing of the snp : o ? -> Bod ? -> B ==>? = noun  . 
We recognize here Tesni ~ re's " translation " concept : the " translation " eJb_e  .   . Eg3Lg_LEt ~ ( see Tasni 0 repages 443 and seq . ) . The prepositional phrases which can be considered as adjectives are not only preceded by : de & en  , but potentially by every preposition , for example in : t\]g . ~pardom alna ou lexicographique usualou solon lathSorle\[Ag_b  . EgJ2# . heuristique clans losgraphes appliqu~e~la reconnaissance We can remark here that t~co-or d inatedobie  ( : ts , have fundamentally Be same functlorl that is fD J  . tQ . Lt . _b_g . t_A ~ ~ We shall now deduce linguistic information from the form of the snp  . For example , if we analyse the form : un\[unknown . word\](d ?) , we can deduce that this unknown word is a masculine singular noun for two reasons : it matches the pattern : determiner-noun  , and the whole snp inherits its gender and number from the determiner  . Here is an ambiguous case : \[ unknown word 1\] \[ unknown word 2\]   ( ?? )  ; we have here three solutions : either noun- adjective  , or adjective-noun , or noun-apposed noun . . It is often possible to decide by a morphological study of each word :  I'~lectrlclt6 c ~ r ~ J brale --> d ? ? and Iclt6 ==> singular feminine noun ==> noun-ad!ective unenouvelle conception --> d ?? and tlon==> singular feminine noun == >  . ~ jg . DJL ~ lee and es alpha --> d ?? and no number agreement => noun-a ~ xx  ) sed noun In the texts now processed ( content tables of scientific books )  , we have noun-a diectiy . # , in about 97% eases , probably because French is a centrifugal 155 , Tesnibre pages 33 and 147) . For example , lalinguistique inforn ratique and rinformatique linguistique which are morphologically ambiguous  , are both understood by a native speaker as a form  :   no~_0_z_&d~  . 
If we choose to obtain only one analysis to get one deduction  , we must have an order of trial , barring syntactical or morphological impossibility : this order is now : noun- a diective  , then adjective-noun , then noun-apposed noun , with three stemmas tried in this order . 
3. some p ~ rsing difficulties:
Wrong deductions upon the category come in the cases we have several possible analysises aod whorl morphology does not implies the category : ow hat doeset coordinate ? wdeur \ [  ( Iocal is a trice ) et ( pronostique ) \] noun\[ ( adjective ) el ( adjective ) \] \[ ( valour Iocal is a trice ) et ( pronostique ) \] \[ ( snp ) et ( noun ) \] two possible analysises according to whether of coordinates two snpor two adjectives  ; then ore no stique can be analysed as noun or adjective  ; - if the pattern is ?? without any possible morphological deduction  , the form nour t-adjective will be choased , and that r nay be wrong in some rare cases . 
But at the end of the parsing of the text , the lexicon is extracted and it is possible to consull it to reparse the ambiguous phrases  . 
A . How syntax and morphology work together : In such a pars ~ rr  , the parsed language implies a parsing strategy : in French  , syntax gives more information than morphology ; for example , in English rnarphology is peer and syntax becomes more important  , in German , morphology is richer because of declensions and file three genders  . So , in French , etbA~j2 ~ . . \[ O . g ~ iUi ~ e . ~lb~'z~Z ~ taj?a__n~so ~ L0 i ~\ [ i ~ ht ~ by ~ tphelogy: . at the beginning , we look if it is possible to deduce its category , gender and number , and the deduction is marked sure or not sure , for example : qc it 6= => femin in singular noun , sure (61 ectric itd )- ement ==> masc . singular noun ( enregist remont ) or adverb ( pumment ) -ant ==> present participle , not sure ( concerrrant or passant ) ? in the study of each snp , every category and some geoders and numbers are known and the gender-number agreement is verified  , for example :- at and adjective ( deduced by syntax ) ==> masculine singular ( principal ) -ives and adjective ==> feminine plural ( qualitatives ) If as np does not agreeing oader and number , the analysis fails and the nexts tomma is tested . 
B . Generalease:
First , some n ~ placoments are made in the phrase submitted to the analysis  , for example : space inserted after the apostrophes to isolate/'ord'as one word  , autour de --> autour . de ( one word ) , duo->dele , des--> de los , au-->" , ) le , aux - . > #los . 
Then for each word , the lexicon is consulted , and if not found , the first morphological study is made ( see above )  , when ce the set of the possible categories of each word  ; this set is classed in the order of trial . 
Then the ~ h . ? L6L h~Lg_J ~_ rl:Ls ~ t ) ~ is made from tire combinations of the possible categories of each word  , and from contextual constraints of each letter of the pattern  ; these constraints are as severe as possible to reduce the number of combinations as much and as so on as possible : for example  , for the phrase : 6 volution de 1'61 octro . . enc6phalodramn?e d ' unmalade attaint deparaly sie g6n6rale salonloseffetedu traitement , the number of possible patterns is reduced from 1250 to 8  . 
\] hen , each pattern is tested until the first successful analysis  , except if there are possible adverbs , infinitives or present participle . In that case , a measure of the quality of the analysis is made to get only tile best analysis  . 
The test of ol ~ a pattern is made in the following way : the pattern by snp is calculated : I ' electric it &  c6r6brale - -> d ?? --> G ( G = snp )  ; maladies mentale set 16starts ducerveau --> ?? c ? od ?--> GcG ( o = prepesition internal to snp )  ; /' activation parfer meture des yeux --> d?p?od ?   . -> GpG ( the activation by closing eyes )   ( p = preposition external to snp )  . 
We verify that this pattern by snpcarl constitute a cnp  ( topdown aspect )  . 
The patterns by snp may be for example : G ( snp ) GcG ( coordinated snp ) GpG ( sub . ordinated snp ) GrG ( two snpsepared by a present participle )  . 
We try to apply tile . & gg\[g . t~3 . tLg_qJM . .L ~ . ( bottom-up aspect : see above ) . 
\]' hen we study each snp :- we test if it is possible to find a match with one of the three stern mastested in the order : ~ r ~  . g . ~ . _tL  ~, then d .  ~  . O .  #J , tB , then  g . B . _ -  .   .   .   . ~  , when ceadeduced or confirmed category ( noun or adjective ) for every question mark ; -we test if we have a gender-number agreement between the governing noun and its eventual depending determinant and adjectives  ; this is done by a set intersection algorithm and by getting gender and number of the determinants from the lexicon  , and by a morphological study ( see above ) of adjectives and nouns whose category h\[~s just been deduced  . 
At any moment , if a constraint is not satisfied , the test of this pattern is stopped and the next one is tested  . 
A bracketed phrase gives the history of the analysis  . 
CoA parsing example : valour Io calls at rlc~et pr ' o no stlquo process by ward : ? valour ? Iocal is a trice bcCet coordinates adjective  ( b )  , snp(c ) or prep . phrases ( C ) ? pronostique C is impossible because et is not followed by a preposition possible patts rns : ?? b ? ? ? c ? test of ? ? b ? calculation of the pattern by snp : ? ? b ? -> G possible cornplex phrase agglutination : appScabie rule : ? b ? -> A  ( co = ordinated adjectives ) to calisatrice : ?= adjective pronostique : '? = adjective bracketed structure : valour + A  ( Ioeal is a trice + at + pronostique ) new pattern : ? A and end of agglutination study of the single snp : syntactical constraint : ? A matches with the stamina  1   ( noun-adjective ) valour : ?= = noun morphological constraints : valour : singular  ( by morphological study ) Iocal is a trice : feminine singular ( -trice by morphological study ) pronestique : singular ( by morphological study ) gender-number agreement : fer ninine singular this snp is correct and of course the cnp is correct : wdeur > neun/f/s can be adjective elsewhere Iocalisatnce > odj/f/scarl be noun elsewhere  , qualifies valour pronostiquc > adj/f/s can be noun elsewhere  , qualifies valeur bracketed structure : G ( valour + A ( Iocal is a trice + at + pronostique )   ) if we ask for all possible analysises , we get alo : G ( wdeur + loeal is a trice ) . ~et+G ( pronostique )
