IINTRODUCTION
In this paper we present a general model of cmmn unication applied to the special case of dialogue  . Our broad perspective aims to account for the many facets of human dialogue within a singl ~ theoretical framework  . In particular , our project's aim of incorporating relevant nonverbal communicative acts from the person -machine interface make it essential that the description of communication be sufficiently broad  . 
The model described here takes as its starting point the communicative utterance or act  . It considers the higher-order structures into which communicative acts may be incorporated  , but does not detail their internal composition . It is in this sense that the model provides a framewerk for the formal treatment of dialogue  . 
2 COMPONENTS OF THE MODEL
A full description of the adopted dialogue model has been given in Egan  , Ferrari , Harper , et al (1987) . 
It relies on a double deserlption of dialogue : a syntactic analysis of dialogue structure and a semantic-pragmatic description of the communication context  . The basic units are :- meaningful expression ( ME ) : Any physical act carrying a noncontextual meaning  ; -communicative act ( CAct ) : An instance of ME issued by a specific " issuer " and received by a specific " receiver "  ; -communicative situation ( CS ) : The CAct together with all the relevant facets . 
-communicative situation structure ( CSS ) : A larger aggregation of " CSs that provide a bridge into the intentional component of the dialogue model  . 
Each of these components is discussed in more detail below  . 
2 . 1 Communicative Acts and Dialogue Structure The syntactic component of the dialogue model relies on the fact that  , if we examine a dialogue or any other communicative exchange  , it is possible to observe in the sequence of communicative acts  , subsequences which follow regular patterns . These patterns can be catalogued in a form which expresses their significant regularities  . This approach leads to a descriptive method very similar to the formal description of language in terms of a vocabulary of terminal symbols  ( the communicative acts )  , a vocabulary of auxiliary symbols ( a collection of labels )  , and a set of productions ( discourse patterns ) . Within the definition of a communicative act , provision is made forgestural information accompanying an utterance  , such as a deictic gesture involving amouse or some other pointing device  ( in the context of person-machine interaction )  . 
The idea of treating discourse segments like phrases in a sentence is not new  ( cf . Burton , 1981) . 
However , the nature of the entities involved is rarely fully clarified  . In Christie , Egan , Ferrari , et al (1985) , a dialogue classification system was presented , based on the system of classification of Burton ( 1981 )  , It consisted of a set of functional labels divided into the following five hierarchical levels  , from lower to higher , acts : marker , summons , elicitation , reply . . . . , moves : ( delineating , sketching . . . .  , exchanges : ( explicit , boundary , conversational ,  . . . ., transactions : ( exchange , . . . interactions : ( transaction . . . .  The labels at the act level are defined in terms of functional labels assigned to expressions  , such as " starter " , structurally realized by a statement , a question , or a command ; " informative " structurally realized by a statement  ; " elicltation " , structurally realized by a question . These , together with their functional definitions , represent a closed set of elements . The labels at a higher level are all defined in terms of patterns of labels of the immediately lower level  . This set of rules may be regarded as the set of productions  , which generates communications . In this way , a dialogue/communication is adequately described in terms of a formal generative grammar  . An ATN-like grammar of dialogue in these terms has been described in Egan  , For rest , Gardiner et al (1986) and Reilly ( in press ) . 
2.2 ~ ommunicative Situations
The semantic-pragmatlc description relies on the notion of " communicative situation "  ( CS )  . ACS is a way of representing the communicative exchange together with its context  . It consists of facets , which are aspects of the CS that occur with a certain regularlty in all CSs of a given sort  . Facets may be formally conceived of as " sorted regularities " in the scene where communication takes place  , therefore a CS may be described as
CS wfs'ft . . . .  where the subscripts identify the sort of the facet  . 
It is relatively easy to identify the sort of the more frequent regularities  , such as who the issuer is ( fi ) , who the receiver is ( f ) , etc . , and to consider these as constituent elements of a CS  , around which other facets become , from time to time , relevant . 

Situation Semantics has been shown ( ef . Egan , Ferrari , Harper , et al 1987 ) to have some advantages for the representation and the treatment of a CS  , provided that certain modifications and extensions to the original description of a discourse situation are carried out  . In communication , since more than one , and often more than two , participants are involved , each with different attunements to the CS and different perceptions of what in Situation Semantics is called the speaker's connections  , more than one classification of the same CS is possible  . In the best case , where participants understanda CS in the same way  , communication is successful , otherwise some failure occurs . In general we can assume , that participants in a communicative event are able first to classify  , and then understand situations on the basis of the situation types they share  . In the spirit of SS , we assume ~ latthese CS-types are the description of regularities observed in actualeo ~tunicatiens  . An important consequence is that a new notion , relevance or relevant ~- ~ M , is established in terms of the more frequently observed regularities  . 
We can , then , describe the facets of the conununicative situation in terms of properties of that situation  , where the notion of relevance intervenes at two levels  . At the first level , the set of properties is not defined a priori . Different properties are relevant to the interpretation of different utterances in different situations  . Some of the searc involved more frequently than others in the process of understanding  , and may be considered , to refundamental than others to a CS . These seem to be the roles of issuer , receiver , location , colm ~ unication mode , illocution . The communication mode , i . e .   , whether co~mtnication happens face-to-face , by telephone , or in any other way , may affect both the form of the message and the referring expressions  . By illoeution , the traditional illocutioeary force is meant , although a more fine ~ grained classification of speech acts is intended  ( cf . Christie , Egan , Ferrari , etel , 1985) . Also , other facets of a CS may occasionally become relevant to the understanding of an utterance  . 
At the second level , each property of a CS is taken to be a role participating in an intersecting set of regularities which qualify its sort  . Thus , the property : \[ xl < < l , saying , x ,  ~> , l >\] describes some indeterminate x saying ~ , and participating in those situations where it is " regular "  ( nomie ) that some x say s ~ . 
By further specification we can assume that \[ a - tourist l < < l  , saying , a-tourist , e > , l >\] participates in those situations in which x is of type a-tourlst  . In Barwise and Perry's(\] . 985 ) notation this would be given as :\[ xIInS : a -tourist  , x , yes \] where S is the set of situation-types in which a tourist is involved  . 
Both properties and types classify real objects that become lelevant to a discourse situation in accordance with the relations participants are attuned to  . On the basis of this notion of relevance , it is possible to define a large set of types of properties which may or may not appear in one or the other CS  . A receiver makes use of these classificatory devices to classify and understand any speeifle CS with which he or she is presented  .

Figure 1" Structural components of the model 2 . 3 Cotmmunicative Situation Structures The Conmtunicative Situation Structure  ( CSS ) is equivalent in level of analysis to the discourse segment of the Grosz and Sidner  ( 1986 ) model . The three components of the CSS ( see Figure I ) are the conm~nicative act component ( CAct )  , the communicative situation component ( CS ) , and certain properties specific to the CSS itself  . A CSS can consist of a number of CSs , and these in turn can consist of a number of CAets  . The nature of CActs and CSs has already been discussed above  . 
A number of factors serve to distinguish one communicative situation from another  . These can involve any change in the context of the dialogue  ; for example , a change in location or a change of speaker , in the ease of person-mach ~ le communication it is most likely to involve a change in the speaker or a change in some aspect of the computer's visual display  . 
A number of eo~nunicative situations go to make up a CSS  . What distinguishes one CSS from another is a change in the purpose of the CSS  . The CSS is also the repository of information about what entities in the dialogue arc currently in focus  . Thi . s information is used in the reso\] . ution of anaphora . 
2 . 4 Structural Relations h~p ~ , A CSS can be related to another CSS in a limited way  . 
The relationship can only be hierarchical , and it represents a route through which information relating to the focus of attention can be transmitted  . If tile focus of attention is on one CSS , definite noun phrases and anaphora in general can be resolved either from entities in focus within the current CSS or from the focus space of a CSS that is connected to the current one  . 
Figure 2 represents a structured collection of CSSs . 
As can be seen , they consist of a number of tree fragments , rather than one large tree . Such a situation can occur if the purpose of a dialogue is to achieve a number of distinct goals  , which cannot be integrated under a dominating CSS . 
3 PRAG MATICDIMENSIONS 3 . 1 Attentional State The disembodied arrow in Figure  2 represents the current focus of attention . The focus of attention sets bounds on what are valid targets for anaphorie reference within a CSS  . This focus shifts automatically as a new CSS is created  . It can also be shifted by one or other of the dialogue participants explicitly requesting a shift of focus back to a previous topic in the dialogue  . However , there is a constraint put on this shift . When moving from one tree fragment to another , the focus of i attention can only shift to the topmost node of the Figure  2: A set of corn rnurficative situation structures target tree  . From there , it may traverse the subordinate nodes of the tree to locate the apprd priate CSS  . This restriction reflects the fact that when a dialogue participant returns to a previously active topic in the dialogue  , he or she tends to proceed from the general to the specific aspect of that topic  . Traversal of the CSS tree from top to bottom represents such a transition  . 
The component of the model operated upon by the attentional mechanism is the focus space  . This consists of a list of items that we call discourse objects  . Tile entities on the list can either have properties in their own right  , or can Inber it them f\]:'om higher up in a classification hierarchy  . The reason for having highly structured objects in the foe ~  . ~s space , is to allow for the resolution of anaphoric rcferenee  . ~ of the following type ( after
S~dner , 1.9/9):
A : if : saw John's Irish Wolfhound yesterday
B : Yes . They're really big dogs.
! i ~( J ' , ) the phrase ljh_eJ_~ge does ; lot refer back to any ~ pecifio entity mentioned in  ( A )  , but rather to t ; hceJ : : J . ss of dogs of whie hJohn's is a member . In orders L . toeessfu\] . ly to resolve this reference , knowledge ~<: eds to be available to the resolution process concerning the class of entities to which the speeificirish Wolfhound mentioned belongs  . The way this is achieved in tile model described here  , is to a \] . \ [ low the entities in the focus space to inherit properties via a classification hierarchy  . 
3.2 Intentional Structure
As has been pointed out in the description of the dialogue structures  , the topmost element of the structural hierarchy ( the CSS ) contains a pointer into a structure representing the purpose of the CSS  . 
Crosz and Sidner refer the set of such CSS purpose  . ' . ~ as the intentional structure of the dialogue . In essence the CSS purposes arc elements in the plan underlying the dialogue  . In the case of a person-machine dialogue system , they are the actions that tile user wishes the system to perform  . There are t ~ ; o relationships that can hold between elements of the intentional structure and these are dominance and satisfaetion-@rpcedenee  . These represent goal/sub-goal and pre-eondltion relationships  , respectively . 
The hierarchy of intentional elements is more or less isomorphic to the dialogue structure  , as can be seen in Figure 3 . Here , tlle dialoguest 1: ucture i . ? ~: epz'esented by white boxes and the underlying intentional structure by shaded boxes  . Also note that the intentional structure may be expanded by an inferential process  , without there being a col : responding node in the dialogue structure  . 
The specif_ie details of the intentional structure is dependent on the dialogue domain  , unliket be dialogue application of the model , the domain is that of database interaction with the user performing the specific task of tabulating data about students ' a ~ es and courses  . Each intentional component represents an action of tabulation  , and the place that the action has in the intentional hierarchy is determined by the complexity of the table requested  ( or inferred )  .

4 A SAMPLE APPLICATION
The following dialogue ( except $8 ) was collected as part of a corpus of simulated person ~ maehine dialogues collected for the studies described in Egan ~ Harris  , Harper , and Reilly (1986) .   $8 is inserted to illustrate how an inferred intention can he used by the system to direct the dialogue  . 
I\]i : How marly students , both male and female , under 16 or younger in the year degree course '/ $2: Tbere are no students of that age group in the Cell  . ego . 
U3: Again in the 3 year degree course , how many male and female students in the following age groups :  19   20   21   22   23   25 or older $4: Here is the table . 
US : Total\[number of both male and female students in this course of study  $6:   153 males and 559 fema\] . es . 
U 7: Please supply a breakdown of both male and female students in the graduate course  . 
$ 8: Do you wish to see a completes exbyage by course breakdown ? Figure  4 illustrates the unfolding of both the dialogue and intentional structures  ( the numbers in tile boxes correspond to utterances  )  . The intentional structure underlying $8 is inferred on the basis that the user has asked for the same breakdown for two courses  , therefore he or she may wish to have a three-way breakdown for all courses  . This inference then gives rise to utterance $8 , which is incorporated into the dialogue structure  . The left of Figure 4 represents the state of the dialogue and intentional structures up to and including utterance Figure  4: A Structural analysis of the sample , Dialogue U7 . The right : of the figure represents the structure :  ; after $8 . 
In U5 , the reference to all unspecified course ( underlined ) requires that a referent be found . The bi-direetional links in the discourse structure allow information from the focus spaces of the connected nodes to be accessed in the resolution process  . 
Thus , the anaphoric reference in U5 can be reso\] . ved by accessing the focus space of utterances 3 antl 4  . 
Note that : the small disembodied arrows in F igure  4 indleate t : he current attentional state of the dialogue  . 
5 CONCLUSION
The dialogue taode \], out\] . ined above is under-specified in an nmbero fimport : ant aspects  . For exmuple ,   140 algorithmic description has been provided that cang ~ ue rate and utilise the data strttctures of the mode  1  . 
The resettrch programme , of which the work descrihed here is a part , issti \] . l in the early stages of implementation . However , am ~ a ber of implementation decisions have already been made which give some Indie at Jeu of what the final system will look like  . 
Both the dialogue and intentional structures are to be repre ~  ; ented using a frame-based language . The frames will be connected in a network . The instant \] at \] on and interconnect \] on of the frames will be the job of a general control algorithm  , while the filling of many of the slots in the various frames w:i \] i be demo's driven  , That is , associated with each slot will be a function that is activated when data is required for the slot  , such as when the frame containing the slot is instant \] a real  . Limited use will be made of the inheritance mechanism of the f ~: a mesystem  . Inheritance will be main \] . y used for the inheritance of foeus-space information  . The feature of frames that will he most utilised is that of demon-driven slot filling  ,
