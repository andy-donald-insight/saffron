SGS is a compact sentence generation
system . Inputs are the frames and spe-
cifications of a sentence . Programs attached to contextfree rules carry out the generation task  . Output is a surface sentence with an associated derivation tree  . 
suitable laws for a computer from lingistic phenomena  . Therefore , this paper first describes the overall organization of SGS  , secondly explains the linguistic structure of Japanese with which SGS  . tries to deal , and lastly gives examples of sentence generation . 

A sentence genration process can be a considered to be a process starting from nonlinear meaning structures and ending in a linear structure  , i . e . a sentence . Because meaning structures reflect the speaker's intension and a speaker can easily produce a sentence realizing his intension  , one tends to think of sentence generation as an easy task  . 
Famous AI systems including SHRDLU , often adopt a fill-in-the-blank method to generate answering sentences  . Efforts are concentrated on other tasks , such as sentence understanding , planning , deduction , and so on . 
Although study of sentence generation has not been receiving much attention  , it is valuable for the following reasons : i ) to develope a tool which enables a user to understand what has been understood by an intelligent system  . 
2) to build a machine translation system.
3 ) to develop a theory of knowledge representation . If some formalism of knowledge representation is to be valid  , it must be readable . In other words , it must be easily transformed into sentences . And this readablity is checked by means of sentence generation  . 
4 ) to verify correctness of the various linguistic theories from a computational linguistic point of view  . 
SGS is an experimental sentence generation system , the inputs of which are frames representing some meaning  . It generates a Japanese sentence with the help of a user-supplied dictionary and grammar  . The generation process of the SGS is topdown with backtracking  . The result is a surface sentence with its derivation tree  . This system does not generate sentences at random but carefully generate one sentence obeying the user's control information which is given in advance of the generation process  . 
In computational study of sentence generation , building a system is one facet of the study . The other facet is the extraction of
System Organization
SGS is written in ETL-LISP and consists of about i000 line source statements . To actually produce a sentence , it needs three kinds of input , a dictionary , and a grammar . Accounts are given in order . 

A sentence generation corresponds to the speaker's speech process  . Accordingly , if a sentence of good quality is needed , many factors of a speaker should be incorporated . However we restrict ourselves to treating only the syntactic and semantic factors  . The pragmatic factors remained as future problems . 
Conceptually , factors considered here are separated into two categories  . One is the factors governing the intra-sentence al phenomena  , which determines the cognitive meaning of a sentence  , and is stated in terms of phrase structures , transformation , various features and the like . Inputs belonging to this category are the frames representing cognitive meaning of the sentence to be generated  , and the syntactic category ( e . g . SS---Simple Sentence ) of the sentence . In this paper , frames in examples are supplied by the Japanese language understanding system EXPLUS  .   14 The other cateogry is factors governing inter -sentencial phenomena related to " topic and comments "  , such as the distinction between " wa and ga " e . t . c . . These factors reflect a speaker's views . They can be treated by specifying the arrangement of noun phrases or the surface subject of the sentence  . For example , if one wants to put emphasis on a certain noun whose deep case is THEME  , specifying ( S-SUBJ = THEME ) may compel the system to derive a passive sentence whose surface subject is the specified noun  . Therefore , such specifications work as conditions on the sentence or control information for the generative process  . 
In summary , frames , a syntactic category , and conditions on a sentence reflecting a speaker 's views comprise the inputs of SGS  . 
Given these inputs , SGS tries to generate a sentence of the specified syntactic category from the frames by considering the given  21--conditions  . 
Figure 1 is an example of an input frame.
This frame represents the fact that HANAKOBUYSA BOOK  . The REL-TM slot designates relative-time relation to other facts  . The SF slot designates semantic features of the predicate KAW-D  ( BUY )  . CACT ( causal actant ) , THEME are the deep cases of KAW-U .

( N000807 HON ) ) )

Grammar in SGS refers to the collection of context free rules augmented by LISP programs  . 
The role of the grammar is to systematically convert input frames into small trees  , then combine and transform them while making sure of the grammatical correctness of the generated trees  . 
It is not necessary for tree structures to accompany sentence generation  ( McDonald's system doesn't use tree structures )  , but setence generation via tree structures has many advantages  . 
First of all , lingistic knowledge based on transformational theory can be easily implemented in a computer  . Linguistic concepts such as subject , object , scope of quantifier , de-let fon , raising , e . t . c . , are all related to tree structure . Also , organizing the system as a tree manipulation system is a good way to keep its clarity and is helpful in debugging the grammar  . Suggestive information to improve grammar could be obtained by tracing intermediate trees  . Moreover , contextfree rules to construct a derivation tree assures  , to some extent , the grammatical correctness of the generated sentence  . The form of a syntactic rule is: ( < category > < descendents > < Pl > < P2> ) A rule has four fields . < category > and < descendents > form a context free rule : < category > = > < descendents >  . 
< PI > is a LISP program . It is applied to the frames which should be realized as a sentence of the < cateogry >  . It divides the frames into subframes corresponding to each < descendents > considering the attached conditions  . 
< P2> is also a LISP program . It is invoked after the completion of < descendents > subtrees  . 
Its role is to look at the subtrees and make sure of their grammatical correctness  . Transformation is added to the subtrees as necessary  . 
Finally ,  <  P2> returns a partial derivation tree whose top node is < category >  . The rule invocation mechanism is explained later . 

A lexical item in dictionary describes the knowledge of each word  . As for the predicate , a name , a surface expression , semantic features , deep cases and their semantic features are included in its description  . Similar items are included in the noun's frame . The form of an item is: ( < name > < category > < Pi > < unit > ) < name > and < category > are keys for searching the dictionary  . In the case of HON ( a book ) , the < name > is HON , the < category > is noun . 
< Pi > is a LISP program to check conditions for lexical insertion  . 
< unit > is a frame depicting linguistic knowledge of a word  . World knowledge can also be stored in < unit > . 
The description of a lexical item is at a concrete level  . Neither lexical decomposition nor word description by primitives is adopded  . 
Although , with respect to verbs , Japanese has a rather systemic way of deriving new words from a basic word  ( for example , from TOB-U(t ofly ) , TOB-ASU ( to make something fly ) or TOB-ERU ( canfly ) are derived . ) , studies in relations among the lexical items seems not to be advanced enough for use in a computer at present  . 
Generation mechanism
There are many methods to generate sentences . The fill-in-the-blank method is easiest . McDonald's system ~'9 derives a sentence directly from source data . BABEL ~' s derives a sentence indirectly using discrimination nets and a syntax net  . 
As stated previously , SGS generate a sentence via tree structures . Initially , SGS receives an order d triple from a user . Its form is : < category , input-frames , conditions on the sentence > The system regards the order d triple as a goal  . It says " from the input-frames , generate a sentence of the category that satisfies the conditions "  . After pushing this triple to the bottom of the stack  , the system starts the generation process described below  . 
step i : lexical insertion
Look at the top of the stack . Let this triple be category A , frame Fr-A , condition Cond-A . Collect lexical items from the dictionary that match Fr-A and satisfy Cond-A  . 
If no item is found , Go to step 2 . Else , choose one of the items and return it . 
Because backtrack may occur in later process , preserve the unchosen items . Remove the top element from the stack . Go to step 1 . 
22 step 2: subgoal expansion downward
If subtrees under category A are completed , go to step 3 . Else collect rules of the form A descendents P1   P2 from the grammar . Select one of them . Suppose the selected one is < A(BC ) PlP2 > . Execute program Pl to create the subgoals , P1 tries to divide Fr-A into Fr-B and Fr-C . Pl also converts Cond-A to Cond-B and Cond-C respectively  . If this division is successful , push the resulting subgoals < BFr-BC ond-B > and < CFr-CC ond-C > onto the stack  . Gotostepi . If division is unsuccessful , try another rule . If all the tried rules fail , start backtracking . 
step 3: tree building upward
This stop treats the case where subtrees under category A are completed  . Execute program P2 in the rule < A descendents Pl P2> which was used to divide Fr-A at step 2  .   P2 tries to confirm the grammatical correctness of the completed subtrees using interpretation of them  . If one of them is found to be ungrammartical , start back-tracklng . Else transform them as necessary and provide data for later interpretation of the completed tree  . Combine the category A and subtrees to complete the partial derivation tree cor-res poinding to the goal < A  , Fr-A , Cond-A > on the top of the stack . Remove this triple from the stack . If the stack is empty , collect the terminals of the tree in left-to -right order  , give morphological inflection to the sequence of terminals and print them  . Otherwise , go to step i .

Simplified Syntax of Japanese
This section gives a brief account of the simplified Japanese which SGS tries to deal with  . 
A Japanese simple sentence consists of three parts  , as is shown below . It is important to notice that these parts assume different functionalities  . 
Part A to Part B < PP > ~-- ) <UERB><CAUSATIUE> ( PASSIUE ) ->ASPECT ) --->

Part C .   .   .   .   .   .   . ) ---( KA , HA , HE , RO .   .   .   . ) Figure 3 , Slmptitied Syntaxo ? Ja?anese The first part  , A , expresses epistemic moaning of the sentence . It begins with several propositional phrases ( typically two or three ) in unspecified order . A prepositional phrase is derived by the rule < PP ~> < NP > < P >  , where < NP > is a noun phrase , and < P > is a postpositional particle Particles belonging to < P > are GA  , NO , NI , WO , DE , etc . . They work as surface case markers . 
After a sequence of < PP > s , the recomes a verb , an adjective , or nothing . A verb can be followed by SERU'SASERU ( causative particles ) or RERURARERU ( particles of passive or spontaneity etc . ) . These particles are connected to a verb so tightly that thay work as a single word  . 
Words for < ASPECT > , TE-MIRU ( to try ) , TE-AGER U ( to indicate a speaker's attitude to the hearer in which a speaker kindly does something for the hearer  )  , TE-KURERU ( opposite to TE-AGERU) , etc . 
are the last constituents of part A . These are all verbs . 
The second part , B , indicates a speaker's attitude to . the proposition expressed by part A . 
This part contains DA ( affirmative),
NAI ( negative ) , DAROU(guess ) , RASII ( conjecture) , etc . . These are all particles . 
Expressions in the last part , C , are meant to cause some effect on the hearer . Among them are KA ( interogative ) , NA ( prohibition ) , 
NE ( suggestion ), RO ( imperative ), etc..
A predicate ( verb , adjective ) has a case structure . For example , OK-U ( put ) has three cases : CACT ( causal actant )  , THEME , and LOCUS . 
Each case is accompanied by specific particles.
CACT and GA , THEME and WO , LOCUS and NI or DE are usually used in pairs . The case system is a basic linguistic structure in itself  , but the primary objective of SGS is not the study of case system in Japanese  , so SGS utilizes the case system of EXPLUS . 
Syntactic rules governing the connection of particles following a predicate are said to be described by a regular grammar  . 
As for tense representation , TA is used to indicate the past or perfect tense . TA can be inserted between either part A and part B  , or 23-part B and tense systems are discussed in the following sections  . 
A compound sentence is composed of simple sentences  . A relative clause in Japanese is derived by the rule < NP > ~< S > < NP >  . This rule yields a left branching structure peculiar to Japanese in centrast to English  . In this paper an example of a sentence using a relative clause is shown with discussions  . However , sentences with coordinate structures are not treated  . 
From a transformational standpoint , embedding structures are important . A causative or passive sentence is typical of embedded structures  . A generation example of a causative passive sentence is shown later  . But how a passive and causative sentence is derived from the initial structure is not definitely solved  . 
Aspect z , 2
In order to achieve temporal representation , treatment of tense and aspect is inevitable . First we discuss the Japanese aspect system which brings a lot of insights useful to computational linguistics  . 
The basic role of aspectual representation is the distinction between perfect and non-perfect  . It seems to be common to many languages . However , actual languages provide mechanisms for aspectual representation developed beyond this distinction  . 
In Japanese , many types of aspects are realized by using aspectual particles following a verb  . TE-IRU and TE-SIMAU are most typical . 
For instance , YON-DE-IRU ( YON is a contracted form of the verb YOM-U ( to read ) ) means the repeat o f read ing or the exper ience of reading  . 
YON-DE-SIMAT-TE-IRU means being in the state after the achievement of reading  . Several primitive aspects are shown in f ig  .  4 .

pred ~ ca ~ ell-s ~ a tlvel cross c\[as = Ifica tlonbyl+-dura ~ ive  , +-resutta~ive , etc . 
Figure 4 . Cte~sificatton o ~ Rspects and Predica ~ es There are stative  , inchoative , completive , and other aspects . The stative aspect is subclassified into three subclasses  . TE-IRU performs an important role in establishing these subclasses  . 
Verbs in Japanese are classified according to the aspectual meaning of the combination of the verb and aspectual particles  . As a result , aspect features are assigned to a predicate and an aspectual particle  . For example , \[- durative , + resultive \] is assigned to OK-U . \[+ stative , + durative\]is assigned to an adjective or a cupulative expression DA  , and so on . With regard to particles , \[+ stative\] , \[+ completive \] are assigned to TE-IRU and TE -SIMAU respectively  . 
Once aspect features are assigned to the predicate and the particles  , an interpretation of the aspect of a composite predicate is mechanically deduced by looking only at the aspect features of each consistuent  . The aspect of YON-DE-IRU , for example , is obtained in such a way that the aspect features of YON-U  ( read ) and TE-IRU are examined first . YOM-U has\[-stative , + durative , + resultative \] and TE-IRU has\[+stative\] . Then the features are synthesized in obedience to ' synthesizing rules of aspects ' In this case the result is \[+ durative  , + resultative , + stative\] . It allows twe interpretations , which is compatible with the aspectual ambiguity of YON-DE-IRU  . One interpretation , based on the combination \[+ durative , + stative\] , is the progressive interpretation --- being in the state of reading  . 
The other interpretation , based on \[+ resultative , + stative\] , is the experiencing interpretation --- being in the state of after reading  . These aspectual ambiguities are resolved by context or adverbials  . Similarly , the aspect of YON-DE-SIMAT-TE-IRU is obtained in the same way  . 
It is easy to see the advantage of ' aspect description by aspect features '  . It enalbles us to treat the ( Japanese ) aspect mechanically in both directions -- sentence understanding and sentence generation  . However , though a great deal of progress has been made in the study of Japanese aspects  , we have not yet devised a satisfactory system for aspect description by aspect features  . 
Tensei , a
It is wellknown that TA stands for not only past tense but also the speaker's confirmation  , recollection , or immediate requirement . 
Consequently , we cannot simply say that TA indicates past tense  . Instead there are a number of evidences suggesting that TA indicates the perfect as well  . As will be explained in the following , treating TA as a perfect-indicator leads to a succsinct description of tense interpretation in Japanese  . This fact itself , in the author's opinion , is the strongest evidence for TA as a perfect -indicator  . 
\[+ perfect \], therefore , is assigned to TA . It is also assigned to a predicate accompanying TA  . 
If a predicate does not accompany TA , \[- perfect\]is assigned . Some definitions are needed before stating tense interpretation in Japanese  . 
Definition : speech time is the time when a speaker speaks  , and event time is the time occupied by the events ( facts ) refered to by a sentence or a clause . 
With this definition , the principle of tense interpretation in Japanese is stated as follows  . 
- -24 -? A sentence of a clause containing a predicate of + perfect  ( -perfect ) refers to the events or facts previous ( not previous ) to the standard time . 
The standard time of a simple sentence or a main clause is the speech time  . The standard time of a subordicate clause is the event time refered to by the main clause  . 
In short , TA asserts something has occured previously . Detailed tense interpretation using the aspect feature ' stative ' is summarized in figure Fig  . 5 which is hereafter called ' the principle ' .

However some complex sentence has exceptional tense interpretation  . Consider the next sentence in which the conjunctive TOKI is used  . 
KAKI-WOTA BE-TA TOKIKANE-GAN AT-TA.
( a persimmon ) ( ate ) ( abell ) ( rang)
When I at ea per simmon , a bell rang.
According to the principle , TA of TABE-TA assures that eating-a-persimmon preceds bell-ringing  . But , unfortunately , such is not the case . The fact implied by the sentence is the simultaneity of eating-a-persimmon and bell -ringing  . 
Such an exception may be ascribed to the peculiarity of the conjunctive TOKI  . Since TOKI is also a noun and means time . TOKI used as a conjunctive is apt to connote ' at the itme when '  . Exceptions to tense interpreation seem to depend on the conjunctive in the case of an adverbial clause  , or the head noun in the case of a relative clause  . Therefore case studies of tense interpretation are needed  . 
Tense interpretation of the sentence type SI-- conj  --$2 concerning Japanese tense conjunctives rOKI ( when )  , MAE ( before) , A Te ( after ) is summarized in Fig .  6 . 
S1 is a subordinate clause . $2 is a main clause . The aspect feature +- stative is a feature belonging to the predicate of  $2  . ' applicable ' means that the principle is applicable  . ' simultaneous ' means that the tense interpretiation is exceptional and the simul -taneity of the events refered to by  S1 and 82  . 
In the case of relative clauses , a tense interpretation table like the above can be similarly constructed  , but the situation is worse in the case of adverbial clauses  .

TAROU-GATABE-TAKE IKI-WAHANAKO-GA TUKUT-TA.
(TAROU--name ) (ate ) (a cake ) (HANAKO--name ) (made ) The cake that TAROUate was made by HANAKO . 
The main clauses is HANAKO-GATUKUT-TA ( HANAKO made a cake )  . The relative clause is TAROU-GATABE-TA ( TAROUate the cake )  . Both clauses include TA , so the prediction by the principle is that the event TAROU-GATABE-TA preceds the event HANAKO -GATUKUT-TA  , which is exactly opposite to usual tense interpretation  . 
Because of these difficulties , SGS did not go far with respect to aspect and tense interpretation  . Obviously further investigation from a linguistic point of view is needed for mechanical aspect -tense interpretation  . 
Generation Examples
Relative Clause
There are two types of relative clause.
One is the TAROU-GATABE-TAKE IKI ( the cake which TAROUate ) type . The other is the TAROU-GAKE IKI-WOTABE-TAZIZITU ( the fact that TAROU atea cake ) type . 
The example shown is the former type.
Meaning structures consist of two propositional frames  P0000Ol and P000002  . Note that they have a common filler ( NO 00002 . 1TA) . 
Initially specified are the top category SS , the arrangement of propositional phrases -- first THEME then LOCUS  , and the surface subject--THEME . These inputs are goals saying " generate a sentence from the frames shown in figure  7  . As to the sentence , its category must be SS(simple sentence ) , its surface subject must be THEME--ITA ( aboard ) , and THEME must be to the left of LOC US " . 
On receiving these inputs , the system starts rule invocations . The invoked rule -25 selects a frame suitable for a main clause . 
Priority of the selection is given to the frame which includes a REL-TM  ( relative time ) slot filled with " HATUWA " ( speech time )  . In this example , P000001 is selected . It states that TAROU-GAITA-WOTA TEKAKE-RU ( TAROU leaned aboard somewhere )  . P000001 being selected , the system continues invoking rules in order to translate 
P000001 into a main clause.
During the course of rule invocations , the generation process reaches the stage where the THEME slot is treated  . Because the THEME slot and its filler--(NO00002 . ITA ) , are always supposed to correspond to a noun phrase  , rules of the form < NP > ~> . . . are invoked one by one . 
As ( N000002/ITA ) is shared with another frame , P000002 , which states that HANAKO-GAITA-WOOI-TA ( HANAKO put aboard )  , < NP > -~< S S > < NP > , a rule for a relative clause , eventually is invoked . It produces a relative clause--HANAKO-
GAOI-TAITA ( aboard which HANAKO put ( eMT ~-- ( (IDENT ? ( P@ee@e2 PROPOSITION ) )  ( LINK ( THEME ( N@Q O@e2 . ITA )) ( CACT(N@OeO@3 . HRNAKO )) ( REL-PTM ( Peeeel . PROPOSITION ))) ( SELF .   ( a ITU-DOKO with REL-PTM )   ( a MODALITY ) )  ( REL-PTM- ( KAHRYOU ( 50 RE-WA ( P0@@0@I . PROPOSITION ) TOKI ) ) )   ( SF-~UA SPC ~ UTI )   ( PREDICATE ? OK-UUERB )   ( CACT ? ( N0@@0@3 . HANAKO )) ( THEME ? ( Heoeee2 . ITA )) (( IDENT-(P000001 . PROPOSIT . ION )) ( LINK ? ( THEME ( N000002 . ITA )) ( OACT ( N000001 , TAROU ) ) )   ( SELF- ( a ITU-DOKO with REL-TM )   ( a MODALITY ) )  ( REL-TM- ( KANRY OU ( SORE-UA'HATUWA'TOKI ) ) )   ( SF ? X VA SPO ~ V T l )   ( PREDICATE-TATEKAKE-RUVERB )   ( CACT ? ( N 0 0 0 0 0 1 . TAROU )) ( THEME-(N000002 . ITA ))) ( QSTM--((IDEHT-(N000003 . HANAKO ) )  ( SELF ? ( a HITO ) )  ( SF?XANIMAL ) )  ( ( IDENT - ( N 0 0 0 0 0 2 . ITA ) )  ( SELF ? ( a SYAHEIBUTU )   ( a HEIMEN ) )  ( SF?~ARTOBJ ) )  ( ( IDEMT - ( N@@@@@I . TAROU ) )  ( SELF- ( a HITO ) )  ( SF ? ~ ANIMAL ) ) ) somewhere )  . It first builds a tree for the sentence HANAKO-GA ITA-WOOI-TA from  P000002 and completes the realtive clause by moving the position of ITA to the end of the sentence  . 
Generally speaking , complex noun phrase restrictions should be considered  , but they do not work here . After the completion of the relative clause concerning  ( N 0 0 0 0 0 2 . ITA ) with a corresponding derivation tree , SGS tries to complete the main clause , but , since the rule invoked for the main clause allows only CACT--TAROU as a surface subject  , it cannot satisfy one of the initial goals ( S-SUBJ = THEME )  . Soback track occurs . 
Finally , the alternative rule < SK > => < SK > < RAREi > is invoked  . It generates a passive sentence whose subject is THEME--ITA  , and the rest of the specifications are also satisfied  . '-*-' in the derivation tree indicates a non -exsistent filler of the obligatory case in the given frame  . 
A passive sentence treated by SGS is ' a pure passive sentence ' which does have a counterpart in English  . There is also another type called ' an adversitive passive sentence '  . 
This type is too subtle to treat mechanically . Therefore we consider only pure passive sentence and the rules for them  . 
Causative Passive Sentence
Japanese causative sentences , which are identified by the occurence of VERB+ SERU  . 
SASERU , often admit two types of interpretation . Consider the next sentence .

TAROU-GAHANAKO-WOY UKA-SERU.
(togo ) = THEME ) -- initial goal--
After the completion of the derivation tree and the  ( embedded ) sentence corresponding to
P000068 , the rule mentioned above notices the tense of P000068 as being + perfect . This featre would entail an occurence of TA in front of SASERU on the surface level  . But word order such as . . . TASASERU . . . is ungrammatical so TA is supressed . 
A causative sentence corresponding to
P 000067 is built by raising CACT of the embedded sentence  . The raised CACT--HANAKO changes to THEME . The resulting tree structure is , roughly speaking , \[-*-HANAKO\[HASIGOTATEKAKE-RU\]
TA\].The symbol-*-means non-exsistent filler.
Owing to this structure , a passive sentence whose subject is THEME--HANAKO can be derived and  ( S-SUBJ is satisfied . 
One interpretation is that TAROU forces
HANAK Otogo . The other is that TAROU permits HANAKO to go . Ambiguities can be resolved by adverbials or context  . These ambiguities bring difficulties to the treatment of causative sentences  , but , for simplicity , SGS deals with only the former type . 
The example above is a causative-passive sentence . User's specifications are of the category SS and ( S-SUBJ = THEME )  . The initial meaning structures consist of two propositional frames  . The generation process begins by choosing a HATUWA frame to serve as an orign of time relations in the given frames  . The chosen frame , P000067 , includes a predicate slot containing SASERU . It will produce a causative sentence . 
While SASERU is a causative particle , it behaves as a verb in the deep level . It is a verb which takes a sentencial object whose case is THEME  . Therefore the invoked rule responsible for completing a causative sentence searches for a sentencial object  . P000068 is the frame for a sentencial object . It states :
HANAKO-GA HASIGO-WOTA TEKAKE-TA.
( aladder ) ( leaned )
HANAK Oleaned aladder.

Sentence generation is a basic task for an intelligent system  , such as a consultant system or a Q . A . system , e . t . c . . SGS , though it is far from being satisfactory , is one step closer to an intelligent sentence generation system  . The next step should be manifold . SGS admits various improvements . 
During the generation process , diverse messages are exchanged between invoked rules so that messages tend to get out of control  . 
Greater regulation is needed.
As for the dictionary , it would be interesting to incorporate ' lexical decomposition '  . Introducing ' lexical decomposition ' can be helpful in organizing lexical items in a dictionary  . However it requires a more refined method of lexical insertion  . 
Linguistic knowledge should be thoroughly investigated and digested  . Though the aspect-tense system in Japanese has been investigated to some extent  , it is not obvious whether the description of aspect-tense system by features is sufficient to represent temporal knowledge  . 
Presently , SGS lacks the ability to continuously produce sentences  . In order to form a paragraph the problem of coreference mechanism  --2?--must be solved . Japanese issorichinellipsis it is necessary to reveral and implement the ellipsis system  .
