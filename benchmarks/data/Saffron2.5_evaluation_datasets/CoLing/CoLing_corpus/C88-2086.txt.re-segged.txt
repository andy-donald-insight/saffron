1 Introduction / Soames 1979/ provide some intriguing counterexamples to the method for deriving natural anguage presuppositions presented in / Gazdar  1979/  . A proposed modification to Gazdar~s method ( /L and man 1981/ ) which attempts to solve the problem exhibited by these couuter examples by introducing extra clausal implieatures " has been effectively argued against in / Soames  1982/  . 
Motivated by the lack of explanation for these reasonably simple counterexamples  , / Soames 1982/ constructs a mechanism that derives presuppositions that is a superset of the approaches suggested by/Gazdax  1979/and/Karttunen and Peters 1979/  . / Mercer 1987/ contains methodological ndempirical arguments against Soames ' approach to the derivation of natural language presuppositions  . 
This paper presents are appraisal of some of the insightful counterexamples to Gazdar's method given in / Soames  1982/  . Given an appropriater presentation f the sentences in question ~ the default logic approach to natural language presuppositions described in/Mercer  1987  ,   1988/gives a simple and straightforward explanation for the presuppositional ture of these sentences  . 
2 General Background
There has been a long history of attempts to define methods that would produce the presuppositions of a sentence  . The default logic approach that is highlighted here follows the general framework set out in / Gazdar  1979/  . One feature of this framework is that the speaker is governed by Grice's Principle of Cooperative Conversation  . 
Assuming these general guidelines allows a competence model of the hearer's interpretation to generate heap propriate presuppositions of sentences with the forms ' a or b ' and ' if a then b '  . Details of this process is given later . 
2.1 Linguistic Presuppositions
Being implied by a natural anguage sentence and the natural  ( or preferred ) interpretation fits simple negation is the primary quality that qualifies an inference as a presupposition  . This evaluation * This ~ esearch was partially supported by NSERC grants  A7642   ( to It . Reiter ) and A3039 ( to P . C . Gilmore ) . 
420 of inferencesicalled the negation test . Presuppositions are generated from lexical and syntactic on texts  . Those contexts which pass the negation test can be termed presuppositional environments  . Sentences ( 1 ) - ( 2 ) demonstrate some prototypical examples of presuppositions produced by the presuppositional enviromnents  , factive verbs and definitions of words . In each of these xample stim truth of the affirmative a-sentence always implies the truth of the c-sentence  , and the truth of the negative b-sentence normally implies the truth of the c-sentence  .

2.2 Projection Rule Procedures
The procedures for deriving presuppositions of complex sentences prior to/Mercer  1987  ,   1988/that have received most attention are the ones based on the projection rule  . These include/Karttunen 1973 ,   1974/~ /Karttuuen and Peters 1975~   \]979/~ /Gazdar 1979/  , and/Soames 1979~1982/ . The details of these theories are not important . 
What is of importance is the linguistic basis for these theories  . 
Crucial to any theory , of natural anguage presuppositions is the concept of a presuppositional environment  . These lexical or syntactic enviromnents generate inferences  , which are called presuppositions , whether they are in the scope of a negation or not  . In addition to tl ~ e concept of presuppositional environments ~ what is common to all the linguistic theories i the notion of a projection rule which projects the generated inferences as presuppositions of the sentence  . The naive projection rule proposed in / Langendoen and Savin  1971/takes all the presuppositions from all the presuppositional environments con-rained in the sentence and projects them as presuppositions of the sentence  . 
Although the modifications to this simplistic rule differ  ( see/Kart-tunes 1973 ,  1974/ , /Karttunen and Peters 1975 ,  1979/ , /Gazdar 1979/ , and \] Soames 1979 ,  1982/) , a common theme is that presuppositions are connected with surface phenomena  . Although the methods differ in the importance that the semantic representation plays in the derivation of the presuppositions  , without exception the potential presuppositions that are candidates for the  ( modified ) projection rule are generated because the presuppositional environment exists in the surface form of the sentence  ;  2 . 3 A Default Logic Approach The approach presented in/Mercer and Reiter  1982/ and/Mercer 1987~   1988/has a number of distinguishing features . 
1 . The method is based on inferencing in a logical system  , although the logic is not a classical one . 
2 . Theme ~ hod uses semantic representations of the natur Mla  . n-guage sentence . Iu the case of ' if a then b ' the semantic representation that is nsed directly is a derived representation  ( a Db can be derived from a > b , where > is Staln M?er's connective for 3 . All presuppositional environments that generate presuppositions must be within the scope of a negatioue il : lter in the represen  . .
ta U onel ' the sentence or some logical for : m derived from tlf is representation  . 
ilow the method interact : ~ with sentential adverbs is the main theme of this paper  . The definition of presupposition ad the working of the inference procedure in/Mercer  1987  ,   198'8/ solves the seeping problen rscaused by the interaction of negation and other environments  . In the discussion of sentent iMad verbs it will be shown that the normal ~ mntence-seope for negation is circunwented in certain circamst  ; utc(:s . This circumvention of the normal rule explains the presuppositi  , utal behaviour of the sentential adverb environment  . 
2.3.1 Log . ealt Eepresent at lonf
Pre . quppo Mtions rising Default

Ano , ' mal default ~* ule is a rule of inference denoted fl  ( Y ) where a ( Y ) mM fl ( x ' ) area . 1\] first order formulae whose fl'ee variables are among those of  . ~= xl , .   .   . , x , , . Intnitively , a default rule can be interpreted as : For all individuals xi  .   .   .   .   , xm , if the prerequisite t ~( Y ) is belie , rodI and iff l ( , ~') is consistent with what is believed , then the consequent f l ( . ~?) nray be conjectured . A ~ lormal defaul theory is a set of l\[rst order lbrn rulae together with a set of normal defaults  . A fized point of a normal default theory is the deductive closure of tireseteom prised of the first order for nrula c and some maximal set of e on sequents that are consistent with the fixed point  . 
The CONSIs'QUENTS'D is the set of all conseqaents of the default rules in the default thnory  . 
For the purposes of this paper , I will change slightly the interpretation of the default rule to mean : if the speM ? er says ' a  ( ~' ) ' and fl ( Y ) is consistent with the heater's knowledge base , KBH , then the hearer can conjecture fl ( , ~;) . it is not M ) solutely clear what the verb says means ( u ' how it should be represented . For the purposes of this 1raper I only require those notions first presented in /Grice  1975/un-der the title Principle of Cooperative Conversation and form Mized in / Gazdm "  1  . 979/ . Under Ga:zdar's interpretation fGrice's maxims the speakerise  (  , mmitted to the truth of u , the sentence that heutters . 
Therefore the speaker knows u . The conversational approach that I take views the contrihntion of a speaker's ntterance u as the addition of Ksuto  1  ( t 111 along with other conversational intbrmation wld ch is detailed in section  2  . 3 . 2 . The meaning of the utterance is then a function of the inierencing process on  I~Bl-1 UI < su . 
The default rules require some extra in form a *: ion to guard against misuse of the default rules  . This information is a conjunct in the prerequisite of the default rule  . Except for this technical aspect his extra intbrmation plays no role  . Since it creates long default rules , i have tell it out of all the examples . For further details see/Mer-cer/ . 987/ . 
Whenever the discussion concerns the default logic approach  , I will assnme that the speaker's utterance has undergone the first phase of the interpretation process which generates a semantic representation  ( logical form ) of the sentence uttered . This , ; entantic representation The verb believe sholdd bet ~ keatolm ? & lt first order dctiw ~ bleor conjectured from the defaultheory  . 
will be a wellformed sentence in a first order $4 modal language containing a countably intinite set of predicate syntbols  , constant symbols , and variable symbols , plus the logical symbols A , V , D ,  -  , Ks , ~ ndPs . The last two symbols , called modal operators , are to be interpreted as ' the speaker knows that ' and ' for all the speaker knows  , it is possible that ' , respectively . Although there is no general method known to generate this representation  , some gener M rules (: an be followed . Any sentence with an explicit negation is translated into the widely seeped negation of its affirmative counterpart  . Any compound sentence is mapped clause by clause into a logical form  , each clause being treated as a sentence . 
2.3.2 Deriving Presuppositions in
Complex Sentences
The concept discussed here in -- using default logic to derive presuppositions -- is strongly influenced by Gazdar's method  . I will present the representation f presuppositions in following sections with little explanation  . For a complete discussion of how presul ) postions are represented by default rules in a default theory together with how default logic proof theory captures Gazdar's idea of presuppositions being consistent with a context see/Mercer and Reiter  1982/or / Mercer 1987/  . Another influence is the use of clausal implicatnres in connection with deriving presuppositions fl ' om complex sentences  , tuthe default logic approach the clausal implicatures are used to control the division of the original theory into its first order cases  . 
The clausal implicatures are derived fi'om the natural language sentence according to Gaz  , dar's formal treatment of Grice's conversstional principles  ( /Griee1975/ )  . The sentence uttered by a speaker commits the speaker not only to the truth of the sentelme but also to the possibility of its clauses  ( its parts )  . So in tlm case of the speaker uttering ' A or B ' or ' if A then B '  , unless tlmre is background knowledge or there are linguistic reasons to prevent it  , the speaker b ; committed to PsA , P s - , A , PsB , aud Ps , ' ~ B . These implicatures will provide the means to restric the division of the theory representing the utterance into its cases  . 
Becmtse default logic proof theory does ) to tdisplay any analogue to the law of the excluded middle  ( the antecedents of tim default : rust be provable and there is no equivalent to the deduction theorem  ) and because presuppositions do arise from the clauses of complex sentences  , ome form of analysis by eases is required . Since a statement is provable in a case an Mysis only if it is provable in all cases  , the choice of cases is critical . As in the case of a tirst order theory , to ofew cases would allow inappropriate staten muts oI reproved  . In addition because of the nonmonotonic nature of default logic  , having too many casts could prevental ) propriate statements being proved . 
In general the choice of cases must reflect two principles  . Since the case analysis is a proof theoretic analogue of the model theoretic law of the excluded middle  , each ease must completely determine the truth values of each of the disjunets found in the statement to which case analysis is being applied  . Also , since the case analysis is justified solely on linguistic grounds  ( see/Mercer 1987/ for further discussion )  , the cases must reflect this linguistic situation . 3' ojustify a . case , the possibility of the statement that distinguishes the case must  1re provable t ? om the original default theory . Since none of the modM statements ake part in the proofs  , they are left out of the cases . An example should clarify these ideas . 

Suppose the sentence ' A or B'is uttered . '\] ? he defaultheory repre . senting this utterance would be T = Ks ( AVB ) , PsA , P s - , A , PsB , P s - , B , al ,  ? ? ?  , cx , ~ ,  61  ,   .   . , , ~/ ~ ments and $1, .  ? . , ~ n represent the appropriate default rules . 
Since AA-~B and -~ AAB completely determine ( that is , determine the truth values of both ) A and B , and since the statements Ps ( A ^- ~ B ) and Ps ( ' ~ AAB ) can be derived , A ^-~ B and -~ A ^ B distinguish the two cases . Note that although PsA , P s ' ~ A , PsB , Ps ' ~ B are all derivable , none of A , - ~ A , B , - ~ B are candidates for distinguishing a case because  , individually , none of them completely determine the truth values of both A and B  . 
I lence the two cases of the original theory , T , are Tc~s~x = AA"nB , al .   .   .   .   . an , 61 .   .   .   .   . 6n Tease ", = ~ A^B , al , .   .   . , an , ~'1, ? .   .   ,  ~' , ~ The simple negated sentence , an example of which is presented in section 2 . 3 . 1 , is just a special instance of the case analysis procedure  . 
In the simple negated sentence , - ~ X ( which is represented as Ks-~X ) , the possibility of the only case ( distinguished by-~X ) can be proved using the utterance and the theorem ~- Ks ~ XF-Ps-~X  . 
2.3.3 A Proof-Theoretlc Definition of
Presuppositions
Definition 1 A sentence x is a presupposition of an utterance u  , represented by the default theories Auc ~ . ~ t .   .   .   .   . Aua . . . . 2 , if and only/fA , c  ~ , ~- Aa for all ianda eTh ( CONSEQUENTSD ) , but
Au ~/ o ~ and Au\[/A ., ~3.
This definition can be loosely paraphrased as : i fa is in the logical closure of the default consequents and is provable from the utterance  , and all proofs require the invocation of a default rule and in the case of multiple extension default theories  , a is in all extensions , then a is a presupposition f the utterance . 
2.4 Important Differences
The previous approaches which have been mentioned above rely on two ideas  . Firstly , presuppositions are generated from positive and negative presuppositional environments  , if these environments occur in the surface sentence  . Secondly , a number of different methods , collectively called projection methods , are used to screen out those potential presuppositions which are not to be projected  . A brief description of Soames ' method is given in section  4  . 1 . 
The default logic theory described in detail in / Mercer  1987  ,   1988/ approaches the problem of presupposition -generation from the level of logical representation  . Presuppositions are generated from the logical representation if negated presuppositional environments occur in the logical representation f the natural anguage sentence or some logical form which can be derived from this representation  . Malay of the results that the modified projection methods achieve are just proof theoretic results in the default logic approach to natural anguage ~ For purposes of this definition  , the only defaults in each Auco , oia ~ e the presupposition generating defaults . In reality the defaul theory would contain many other kinds of defaults  . The definition would have to be changed so that the proof of c ~  , requires the invocation of a presupposition generating default  , and that a ETh ( CONSEQUENTSD') , where D ' is the set of presupposition generating defaults ~ All of the examples presented in this paper deal with default theories having single extensions  . In those theories which have multiplex tensions , some way of stating that a presuppositions in all extensions is required  . Sincextensions of normal defaultheories are orthogonal  , if An has multiplex tensions then there exists a sentence fl such that AuIAfl and AuVa ~/ ?  . I will call this situation being split along the fl-dimensiom If the extensions do not split along the ~- dimension then either ~ is in all extensions or a is inno extension  . So if Auf-a ~ ( which means that at least one extension contains  ~  ) and Au V/a ~ a ( which means that no extension contains ~ a , which means that the extensions do not split on the a-dimension  ) then ~ is in all extensions . 
422 presuppositions . In addition , once the logical representation fsential adverbs is presented  , it will be shown that the solution to the problem of presuppositions derived from sentential adverbs is again obtained in the default logic approach without any modifications  . 
3 Sentential Adverbs
The two sententiald verbs that will be presented are those found in the examples given in/Soames  1982/: ' too ' and ' again ' . Be can se one of the defining properties of a presuppositional environment is in diocaring positive to the negation test  4  , I will first look at each when there is a negation present  . The interesting property displayed by sential adverbs is that in addition to any interaction betwee negation and the underlying form  , there is also an interaction between ega-tion and the adverb  . This interaction can be captured in two different logical representations  . 
The sententiald verbs have the added complication that they can take any part of the sentence as their focus of the adverb  . The focus of the adverb will be capitalized . Although the verb of the sentence can be focussed  , a presentation f this particular focus would require an event based representation  . I do not discuss this focus in the following . However , it , would be have analogously . 
3.1 Too
The representations of ' kick too ' are shown in ( 3 ) and ( 4 )  . These two representations convey the different foci of the adverb  , ' too ' , the subject and the object of ' kick ' , respectively . I will be only interested in the representation which focuses on the subject  , that is (3) . The explanation for presuppositions that arise from the adverb focussing on the object is similar to the discussion presented below  . 
(3) ~/ x Vy . KICK-SUBJ-TOO(x , y ) = -
KICK(x , y ) ^ ~ z . KfCK(z , y ) Ax#z(4) VxVy . KICK-OBJ-TOO(x , y ) = - KICE(x , y)^3 ~ . ICICK(~ ,  ~ ) ^ y  #z Sentential adverbs have a most peculiar attribute when they interact with natural language negation  . The adverb can be either inside or outside the scope of the negation  . Sentences ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) point out the two possible interpretations in the case of ' too '  . One particularly interesting phenomenon is that all of the possible scopes of the negation and the adverb may not occur in surface form  . For instance ,   ( 6 ) would normally be uttered as ' BILL didn't kick the ball  , either . ' . 
I will use the incorrect surface form in the examples  , however . The italicized portions of the sentences indicate the portion which is in the scope of ' too '  .   ( 5 ) is to be interpreted as : Although someonels e kicked the ball  , Bill didn't .   ( 6 ) is to be interpreted as : Both Bill and someone lsed id not kick the ball  . 
(5) BILL didn't kick the ball , too.
(6) BILL didn't kick the ball , too.
The representations for the unnegated ' BILL kicked the ball  , too . ' and the sentences ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) are shown in ( 7 ) - ( 9 )  , respectively . As proposed in/Kempson 1975/ , /Wilson 1975/ , and implemented in/Mercer 1987/ , the representation f the simple negation of the sentence ' BILL kicked the ball  , too . ' is just the wide-scoped negation as shown in (8) . I have shown the right hand side equivalents of the appropriate representations so that I can contras the two different uegatlons  . 
(7) KICK ( Bill , ball ) A3 x . KICK(x , ball ) Ax ~ Bill 4A positive indication to the negation test means that a sentence  ,  8 , containing the purported presupposition ai environment and the preferred interpretation f not S both have the same inferences arising from the environment i question  . 
(8)-,\[KICIt(Bill , ball)A-lx . KIC lf(x , ball ) Ax ? Bill\](9) - ~ KIG'l((Bill , ball ) AHx . . . ~ KICK(x , ball ) Ax ~ Bill What is important for tile presuppositional analysis is that only  ( 8 ) can be a candidate for the negation test . One of the prerequisites of this test is that the supposed presuppositional environment is within the scope of the logical negation in the logical representation of the sentence  . The logical representation f ( 9 ) does not meet this requirement . 
3.2 Agaia
The situation for the sentent i adverb , ' again ' , is somewhat similar to that described above for ' too '  . The adverb can be inside or outside the scope of the negation  . According ty~the adverbs found in ( 10 ) and ( 11 ) are the presupl ) ositional and non-presuppositional enviromnents with respect o the positive sentence ' Fred called again  , ' .   ( 10 ) is to be interpreted as : At some time in the past Fred called and during some interwl of time which is important othe context in which the sentence is uttered  , Freddidn't call .   ( 11 ) is to be the following interpretation : At some time in the past Freddidn't call and during some interval of time which is important to the context in which tile sentence is u~tered  , Freddidn't call . 
(10) I,'RED didn't call again.
(11) FRED di & ~' t call again.
Th . e representation for ' call , again ' is shown in (12) 5 .

' and the sentences ( 1 ( t ) and ( 11 ) are shown in ( 13 ) - ( 15 )  , respectively . As in the case of ' too ' , the representation f the simple negation of the sentence ' Fb ~ ED called again  . ' is just the wide-scoped negation as shown in ( 1+1 )  . i have shown the right ~ hand side equiw deuts of the appropriate representations so that I can contras the two difihrent negations  .

'- , CALL ( Fred , you , h ) Atl < tAs in the case for ' too ' , the only representation f ' again ' that sanctions the use of presuppositioual machinery is  ( 14 ) s . 
4 Two Approaches to the Prob lem of Sen -~ tent ia lAd verbs NowIca ~ turn to these sentiM adverbs occurring in more complex situations ~ in particular  , example similar to those provided in/Soaanes 1982/  . The two example shown in (1 . 6 ) and ( 17 ) are the kinds of situations which provedifficult for all projection methods  . 
(16) if JOHN kicked the ball , then BILL kicked the ball , too . 
(17) If Fred called yesterday , then he will call again , S This representation cveys only o acfoci of the adverb  , ' again ' , in this c~e , the subject . The object of ' calP , which in this case we ald have to be recovered from cow  , textual cues ( it would pt ' obably be ' yon ' or ' us ' , though it could b caihird party ) can be focussed as well . Since the discussion is similar to that given for ~ too ~  , I will omit it . 
S This is of coarse with cespect to the ~ eutencer presented by  ( 13 )  . 
4.1 Soames ) Approach
Tile method proposed in / Soames ( 1982 ) / is based upon the belief that the two major competing strategies for determining presuppositions  ( /Karttunen and Peters 1979/and/Gazdar 1979/ ) succeed in those situations in which the other one fails  .   7 Tile proposed solution is to synthesize the two filtering strategies so that all the unwanted potential presuppositions are screened out  . 
The synthesisi performed in the following manner . First the po-tential presuppositions of the sentence are computed  . Essentially , the potential presuppositions are all oftile presuppositions of the individual clauses of the sentence if the clauses were in isolation  . The remaining potential presuppositions are those potential presuppositions which are not contextually ore on versation Mly cancelled  . This step is basically Gazdar~s method for generating the presuppositions of the sentence  . The next step is to use these remaining potential presuppositions in the projection phase which is basically the one proposed by Karttunen and Peters  . 
Since all of the examples that Mlow deal only with q f  .   .   . then ' sentences , I will provide only the projection rule for this kind of sentence  . 8 If S :=' If Athen B ' , then the actual presuppositions of S are those entailed by 
AP ^ ( Ar79 By ) where eP represents heactual presupposition f ? . 
A further aspect of this rule is that if ATDBP is true only for truth conditional reasons or is a logically valid statement  , hen this part of the conjunct is ignored . Otherwise , the ' ATD ' is dropped giviug APABP as tlle presupposition f the sentence  5'  . 
This projection method can be applied to a variety of examples  . 
Since I am concerned only with the characteristics of the presuppositional environment ' too ' in these examples only those potential presuppositions that are relevant will be mentioned in the anMysis  . 
(16) has the following properties.
No potential presuppositions are derived from the antecedent clause  . 
AT79 BP=John kicked the ball D somebody ( ~ Bill ) kicked the ball Since ATDBp is logically valid it is ignored  , tIence (16) has no actual presuppositions . 
Similar analyses given opresupposition for ( 18 ) and the pre , mpposi . -tion'Somebody(~John ) kicked the ball . ' for (19) . 
(18) BILL kicked the ball , too , if JOIIN kicked the ball . 
(19) If JOIIN kicked the ball too , then BILL kicked the ball I a order to generate no presuppositions for  ( 20 )  , / So~mes 1979/ requires an extra rule and a somewhat suspect method of interpretation  . A description of the extra rule is not needed here  . tiowever , a quick look at the accompanying method of interpretation is of some importance  . In order for the extra rule to work properly , the clause B in the sentence ' B if A ' must tirst be interpreted a manassertion  . 
This error is undone when the ' if A'portion is heard  . But what is important is the appropriate presuppositions have been c  ; m celled by this point , tIowever , it seems that stress patterns on the llnal word of B when uttered as a sentence and when uttered as the lirst clause of ' B if A ' differ  . Hence no hearer would interpret B as an assertion  . Without this peculiar interpretation , Soames ' method cannot correctly generate the presuppositions for  ( 20 )  . 
(20) BILL ldcked the ball , if JOIIN kicked the ball ~ oo . 
~/ Mercer 1987/ shows th~t there are situations not coveredly the anionotth csc two methods  . 
a This rule is a slightly simplified version of the one given in/So  ,  . mcs 1982/ . It is sufficient for this discussion . 
423 4.2 A Default Logic Approach
The default rule schemata which capture the presupposition ai inferences for the adverbs  , ' too ' and ' again ' , are (21) and (22) , respectively . In the case of ' kick too ' and ' call again ' the appropriate instances of these schemata are shown in  ( 23 ) and ( 24 )  , respectively . 
(21) " ~\ [?( x,y)A3z . ?(z , y ) Ax#z\]:3Z . ?( z , y ) Ax#z3z . ?(z , y ) Ax#(22) J?(x , y , t ) A3 t ' . ?( x , y , t ') At < t'\]:3t' . ?( x , y , t')^t ! < ~ t(23) 3 t ' . ?( x , y , t ') Att < t- .

CALL(x , y , t ' ) At'<t Given simple statements such as those in  ( 25 ) and ( 26 ) the preferred interpretations can be derived from the representation f the sentence and the appropriate default rules  . I have shown the representation for (25) in (27) . The preferred interpretation of ( 25 ) is shown in ( 28 )  . Similar representations can be derived for the preferred interpretation of  ( 26 )  . 
(25) Bill did n't kick the ball , too . ( In the sense of (5) . ) (26) Freddidn't call again . ( In the sense of (10) . ) (27) -, KICK(Bill , ball)VVz . - ~ KICK(z , ball ) vBill = z (28) - , KICK ( Bill , ball ) A3 z . KICK(z , bail ) A Bill  #z  Each of the sentences ( 16 ) - ( 20 ) requires a case analysis . The representation of ' if a then b'is not equivalent o a Db  . However a Db can be derived fi'om standard representations for ' if a then b'such as Stalnaker's conditional logic representation  , a > b (/ Stalnaker 1968/) . The theory presented in/Mercer 1987 ,   1988/ defines presuppositions a inferences derivable from a theory which includes the representation f the sentence  . Therefore the logical form a Db will be available to the deductive machinery  . For any sentence of the form ' if a then b , , the KBH U  Ksu  will be  Zs(a > b ) , ' appropriate default rules ' and sinceKs ( aDb ) is derivable from Ks ( a > b ) and sinceKs ( aDb ) is equivalent to Ks ( ~ayb ) the two cases determined by the algorithm given in section  2  . 3 . 2 area Ab , ' appropriate default rules ' and , a ^- , b , ' appropriate default rules ' . 
The complexity arises in the case of sential d verbs being in either the antecedent or consequent clause of the ' if  .   .   . then ' sentences under investigation because the negation which appears in one of the cases can be done in two possible ways wheat a sentential adverb is contained in the clause being negated  . If the negation of the consequent clause does not put the sentential adverb in the scope of the negation  , the default rule which generates the presupposition cannot be used  . The case--a ^- , b does not infer the presupposition . Consequently , the case analysis cannot generate the presupposition as an inference from the sentence  . 
How is the method of negation justified ? Two assumptions must be made  . Firstly , the antecedent of an'if .   .   . then ' sentence is logically prior to the consequent  . This logical assymetry can be derived fi'om Stainaker's analysis  , or the cause and effect relationship that is conveyed by this sentence schema  . Secondly , /Stalnaker 1973/gives an argument that'if .   .   . then ' sentences are to be interpreted in a manner that is similar to conjunctive sentences  . Stain a ker's view of conjunctions i that the second sentence is affected by the presence of the first sentence  . I will loosely interpret histo include the way the sentence is represented  . Therefore if there is a sentential adverb in the second conjunct  , it should interact with any negations in such a way as to have the same interpretation as in the first clause  . For example , (29) should have the representation given in (30) . 
(29 ) JOIIN didn't kick the ball and BILL didn't kick the ball  , too . 
(30) - , KICK ( John , ball ) A- , KICK ( Bill , ball ) A3 z . -, KICK(z , ball ) A Bill  #zI to we ver , in (31 . ) since the first clause does not contain any negation that would affect the interpretation of the negation in the second clause  , the negation in the second clause would follow the standard clanse-scoping egation rule  . The representation for (31) is given in (32) . This representation together with the appropriate default rule then produces the presupposition ' Somebody  ( ~- Bill ) did not kick the ball . ' . 
(31 ) Today is not Sunday and BILL didn't kick the ball  , too . 
(32)-1 Today is Sunday A ~\ [ KICI (( Bill , ball ) A3 z . KICK(z , ball ) A Bill ~ z \] For any sentence of the form ' ira then b '  , the two cases determined by the algorithm given in section  2  . 3 . 2 area Ab and ~ aA -, b . The representations for the second case for each of the sentences  ( 16 )  ,  (18) ,  (19) , and (20) are given in (33)-(36) , respectively . The negation in ( 33 ) is within the scope of the adverb because the adverb occurs in the consequent and because the antecedent is logically  ( az M conversationally ) prior to the consequent . Therefore the scoping is dictated by that in the antecedent clause  . Similar analyses can be given for (34) and (36) . In (34) the adverb occurs in the consequent , hence the scoping is dictated by the logic Mly prior antecedent  , in (36) the adverb is in the antecedent , but because the consequent is coaversation Mly prior to the antecedent  , it dictates the scoping of the negation in the antecedent  . In all of these cases the scope of the negation prevents the use of the presupposition aide fault rnles to derive the presupposition that would be derived from the clause if it appeared in isolation  . Only in ( 35 ) does the logically and con-versationaily prior antecedent contain the adverb  . The scope of the negation is therefore determined by the normal scoping rule  , hence the scope of the negation is the whole clause placing the adverb inside the scope of the negation  , and giving the appropriate presupposition .

To circumvent this problem , /L and man 1981/ introduces extra clausal implicatures into the method proposed in / Gazdar  1979/  . This proposal has been effectively argued against in / Soames  1982/  . 
/Soaznes 1982/ has enlarged the set of counterexamples found in / Soames  1979/  . Motivated by the lack of explanation for these reasonably simple examples  , he constructs a new approach which is a superset of the methods proposed by/Gazdax  1979/and/Kart tunen and Peters 1979/  . This rococo approach to natur Mlazlguage presuppositions has been argued against on methodological ndempirical lines in/Mercer  1987/  . 
By reappraising the insightful counterexamples to Gazdar's theory given in/Soaznes  1982/  , it is noticed that the semantic representation o f ' if  .   .   , then ' sentences that contain a sentent iM adverb in either theing the presuppositions of the sentence  . The inferential theory for natural anguage presuppositions described in \] Mercer  1987  ,   1988\] gives a simlde and straightforward explanation for the presuppositions \] nature of these sentences  .
