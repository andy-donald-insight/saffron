A new approach for Interactive Machine Translation where the author interacts during the creation or the modification of the document is proposed  . The explanation of an ambiguity or an error for the purposes of correction does not use any concepts of the underlying linguistic theory : it is a reformulation of the erroneous or ambiguous sentence  . The interaction is limited to the analysis step of the translation process  . 
This paper presents a new interactive disambiguation scheme based on the paraphrasing of a parser's multiple output  . Some examples of paraphrasing ambiguous sentences are presented  .

A . THE PROBLEM

The main goal here is to resolve correctly ambiguities arising in natural anguage analysis in every case  . To date , this cannot beae complishe A by any existing automatic MT system  . The problem remains choosing a sentence structure that most accurately reflects the author's intended message and it therefore remains an unsolved and yet important problem  . 
Classical machine translation systems use heuristics based on statistical regularities in the use of language  . Interactive systems ask questions directed at a specialist of the system  ( liker FS of BY U\[Melby & alii 80\] ) and/or a specialist of the domain ( like the TITUS system of Institut Textile de France\[Ducrot  82\]  )  . There , tile interaction is done purely at the syntactic level  , as a syntax directed editor for a programming language is used by a specialist of both the system and the language  1  . 
Models or projects using extralinguistic knowledge will not be able to solve ambiguities in every case : a document is generally supposed to provide some piece of new information that may not be coded in the knowledge base  . 
The use of learning procedures i at present not effective  . 
None of these approaches can resolve ambiguities correctly in every case  . The problem is basically a matter of interpretation : only the author of the document himself can tell what he intended to say  . 
Nevertheless , he is not supposed to have any knowledge of the target ! language and therefore  , he should not be involve during the transfer phase  2  . 
In the case of interaction with the author , two problems arise : '1 . The author is supposed to write his document and not to solve weird linguistic problems  . 
~2 . In all interactive systems , the system asks a specialist questions based on knowledge of the underlying linguistic theory  . For interacting wi Uathe author , this approach is to be rejected : see examples of interaction with ITS\[Melby & alii  80\] or even Tomita's system\[Tomita 84\]  . 

A proposal
To solve these problems , we propose :- to integrate the interactive system as one function of a word processor  , the interaction being initiated by the author ; -to explain an ambiguity presenting a set of paraphrases generated from the set of parse trees of the ambiguous sentence  ; -to explain an error ( of spelling and of grammar ) by presenting a " reasonable " correction and a comment of the error  . This point will not be treated in this paper . See for example \[ Jensen & Heidorn83,
Zajac86b\].
Discussion
The integration ia word processor allows the use of a " controlled language " where checking and correction is done during the creation or modification of a document  . This can be viewed as an extension of the capabilities of a simple spell checker  , in the formatool box of linguistic aids for the author  , checking the spelling , the terminology , the grammar and the style . For the translation of technical material , the use of a normative grammar , imposing precise limitations on terminology and syntax  , will entail more clarity and concision in expression  , as argued by \[ Elliston 79\] and \[ Ruffino82\] , and will offer a convenient tool for normalizing a documentation  . 
In the cases where a correct interpretation uses domain knowledge interactively  , it will be possible to make a clearcut between the pure linguistic knowledge  , to be coded in the analyser , and the extralinguistic knowledge ( semantics of the domain )  . As a matter of fact , it is not always justified to integrate in the grammar specific semantic ategories  , as in the METEO system for example . This separation will allow us to enlarge the domain of applicability of a machine translation system  , that could be , for example , extended to a personal translation system\[ Tomita  84\]  , and this could be interesting when no translation service is available or if the quantity of translation does not justify using the services of a translator\[Kay  82\]  . 
GETA\[Vauquois78\] . There are four main levels of linguistic interpretation :  1  . categories : morphosyntactic categories ( gender , number , class of verb ,  . . . ), semantic ategories ( abstract , concrete, . . . ) , actualisation categories ( perfective , imperfective ,  . . . ), syntactic ategories ( noun , verb , valencies, . . . ) and syntactic lasses ( sentence , verb phrase, . . . ) . 
2 . syntactic functions : subject , object l , object 2 , attribute of the subject , attribute of the object , complement of noun or adjective , detemainer , circumstancial complement . . . .
3 . logical relations : predicate-argument relations . 
4 . semantic relations : causality , consequence , qualifier , qualified . . . .
The geometry of the tree corresponds to a phrase structure : the labels of inner nodes are syntactic lasses  , the labels of leaves are lexical units . Additional information is coded in the attributes of each node  . 
The morphological , syntactic and semantic ategories are computed by a morphological nalyser written in ATEF  . The output of the morphological nalyser will be the input of a structural analyser producing multiple outputs in ambiguous cases  . 
Architecture of the interactive translation system A classical machine translation process in the ARIANE system\[Boitet&alii  82  , 85\] uses a morphological nalys is phase ( MA ) and an automatic structural analysis phase ( SA , on the left of the figure ) . 
This phase is replaced with an interactive phase ( in the middle )  . 
Disambiguation adcorrection dialogues make calls to paraphrasing and correcting modules  . The remainder of the process uses classical automatic transfer steps  ( LT and ST ) and generation steps ( SG and MG )  . On the figure , the existing modules are in bold outline , modules where there exists only a model are in normal outline  , specified modules are shaded grey ) . 
B . THE PROPOSAL
The linguistic framework
The linguistic treatment of ambiguities i based on the struture of a linguistic descriptor  ( labeled and attributed tree ) defined in SCSL\[Zajac86a\] . Let us recall briefly the multilevel linguistic theory of  7B6 descriptor of the source text i


MA\[I-f source lexil source text ! " t/\ .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   . ." __  . . J I paraphrasing modules descriptor of the target text 
ROBRAi
The approach we propose is not to produce explanations using linguistic oncepts of the linguistic model  ( as it has been done up to now , see\[Melby & alii 80 , Tomita 84\]) , but to produce paraphrases that make explici the ambiguous relations  . 
Lexical ambiguities are quite trivial to solve by presenting the definitions from a dictionary  . In this paper , they are supposed to be already solved . Structural ambiguities are treated after a complete parse  . In a practical setting , the best strategy would probably be to produce a complete parse  , to solve lexical ambiguities and then to solve structural ambiguities for the remaining parses  . 
We propose , for some types of ambiguities that can arise , paraphrast k ; transformations that make ambiguous relations explicit  . 
paraphrasing step , the generation being for the same language as the source language  . The process is illustrated below .

Generation of paraphrases
Each parse tree will be sente a paraphrasing grammar  , written in the ROBRA transformational system\[ Boitet & alii  80\]  . Then , each paraphrased tree will be sent to a generator to produce the corresponding string  . The whole process is very similar to a second generation translation process  , the transfer step being replaced by a

NP perturbations NP

NP perturbations NPN sf = coord

In the atmosphere and radiation
Presenting the phrase structure as parenthetized structure  , we may have : 1 .   ( perturbations ( in the atmosphere ( and radiation ) ) )  2 .   ( perturbations ( the atmosphere )   ( and radiation ) ) This kind of presentation ( or a similar projective scheme ) is used in the DLT project of BSO ( personal communication , 1987) and in\[Tomita84\] . A conjunction of coordination van be used to " factorize " a phrase  . The explanation of the scope of the coordination will be the " developent " and the permutation of the factorized terms  . The presentation using the paraphrasing scheme would be as follows : > pertubations in the atmosphere and radiation  1  . perturbations in the radiation and perturbations in the atmosphere  2  . radiation and perturbations in the atmosphere2 . AP as NP complement or VP complement : " Le magistrat jugele senfants coupables " 

GN jugs GN lemagls tratleeenfants GAs f : eplt coupables 
GNJugsGNGA
I smagl stratlosenfents coupables
Using explicit paraphrasing of the determination with a relative pronoun  , we may have : > lemagistrat jugele senfants coupables  1  . lemagistrat jugeles enfants quisent coupables ( the magistrate judges the children who are guilty  )  2 . lemagistrat jngequele senfant sent coupables . 
(the magistrate judges that the children are guilty  )  3 . Subject and object . The sentence " Which author quotes this lecturer ?" may have two interpretations  , f is the syntactic function whose value may be the subject  ( subj ) or the first object ( objl ) of the governor of the sentence , " quotes " . There is also an ambiguity with the argument place  ( argO , argl ) for logical relations ( It ) . In this case , we may present the structures normalizing the sentence to active declarative form  . Note that the phrase structures in this example are identical  . 
Ssf:ob\]lNP quotes NPsf:subJrlr = arglIIlr = argO which author the lecturer 
S sf = subJNP quotes NP sf:objl
Ir = argOII , rf . rgr which author the lecturer > Which author quotes this lecturer ?  1  . the lecturer quotes the author 2 , the author quotes the lecturer4 . A wellknown example . The sentence " Mary sees a man in the park with a telescope " may have six different interpretations a below  .

Maryaman In the park Ii with a telescope

Maryaman NP with a telescope

For paraphrasing , we have to move circumstancials head aud if there is more than one  , to coordinate them . We have also to make noun phrase determinations explicit by using relative pronouns and  , if there is more than one determination for the same noun phrase  , we coordinate them . We should have then : > Mary sees a man in the park with a telescope  1  . with a telescope , in the park , Mary sees a man 2 . in the park which has a telescope , Mary sees a man 3 . with a telescope , Mary sees a man who is in the park 4 . Mary sees a man who has a telescope and who is in the park  5  . Mary sees a man who is in the park which has a telescope 
Conclusion
We have presented a new approach for interactive translation based on the paraphrasing of ambiguou sentences  . Compared to others \[ Ducrot 82 , Melby & alii 80 , Tomita 84\] , this proposal makes a step forward to the user level of understanding  , transfering part of the burden of interaction from themanto the machine : no special linguistic knowledge is required but the simple  ( ! ) everyday competence of the user of language . This could be realized using only linguistic paraphrastic transformations on the output of the parser  . 
Some simple examples have been presented using quite simple transformations : in the case of ambiguous PP attachment there are two possibilities :  ( 1 ) the PP modifies a noun phrase and this could be made explicit by using a relative pronoun  ;   ( 2 ) the PP modifies the sentence and it can be moved a head of it  . 
A set of paraphrastic transformations is now being developed to be able to write a transformational grammar that will allow experiments on a corpus  . 
Notes 1 . In the case of technical documents , the operator ( linguist , translator r documentalis0 may not have enough knowledge to solve some question  . For example , in the sentence " the experiment requires carbon and nitrogent etraoxy de "\[ Gerber&Boit et  85\]  , the scope of " and " is ambiguous and we may read either " carbontetraoxy de and nitrogen tetraoxy de " or " nitrogent etraoxy de and carbon  "  . To be able to choose correctly , we have to know that carbontetraoxy de does not exist in ordinary chemistry  . But again , this conclusion could be false in a very special s6tting   , e . g . an experiment described by the text in which carbon tetraoxy de is being produced as an  ( unstable ) intermediate product of threaction ! 2 . It may be possible to organise the interaction simply by presenting the set of definitions of the transfer dictionary for each unit having  7~9 several equivalent in the target language , and asktim author to choose one of them .
