Project SEMSYN *** achieved a state where a prototype system generates German texts on the basis of the semantic representation produced from Japanese texts by ATLAS/It of Fujitsu Laboratory  . This paper describes some problems that are specific to our semantic based approach and some results of the evaluation study that has been made by the German ist group  . 
I . Generation procedure in SEMSYN
This section summarizes the SEMSYN genration procedure  . 
Those readers who are more interested in the SEMSYN system are recommended to read our previous  COLING84\[I \] paper or the paper submitted to this conference\[2\]  . The generation process begins with the conversion of the semantic networks  , each represents one sentence , into a socalled IKBS ( Instantiated Knowledge Base Schema . ) The IKBS is an instantiation of case or concept schemata denoted by semantic symbols as nodes in the semantic network  . A case schema contains three main description slots  ; a ) roles of cases associated with the semantic symbol  , b ) transformation rules of schemata , c ) choice of German syntactic realization schemata . 
Being triggered by the semantic symbols of the given network  , IKBS specifies the best basic syntactic structure associated with a German word by checking fillers of roles and converts them into functional roles within each German syntactic ategory  . A German syntacto-mor-phological component called  SUTRA-S\[3\] a extended version of SUTRA \[4\] generates German surface texts from the instantiated syntactic structure called IRS  ( Inst-antiaed , Realization Schemata . ) Though English-like terms are used for semantic symbols  , the choice of a German word associated with each semantic symbol and its syntactic structure very differ from the English corresponding one  . 
It . Some problems of semanit cbased translation approach There are some advantages as well as disadvantages of the semantic based approach  , which we anticipated at the beginning of the project  . Theoretically speaking , a reason why we adopted a semantic based approach againt the syntactic transfer approach is founded on the cultural difference and communication barriers between the two project groups that cooperate with each other to build up a translation system  . Understanding the content of the origenal sentence from the given semantic representation the generation group could express it in a way that is common in its mother tangue  , relatively free from the syntactic restriction and lexical corresponding terminology  . It is a wellknown fact that one language of a culture can only be interpreted and not literally be translated into the other languages of different cultures  , as it would be possible within the same cultural sphere  . As the matter of fact we often took this advantage in our generation system  . 
On the other hand , exactly this freedom turned out frequently to be a disadvantage on the generation side  . 
Dealing with real data ( titles of sientific papers in the field of information technology from the Japanese data base JOIS  ) we encountered new problems we didn't expect before and recognized the limit of our approach  . 
In the following we describe some of these problems :  ( l ~ ion ~ ese or iI ~ in al text We had also to come up with this wellknown problem such as lack of articles  ( definite or indefinite ) and of distinction between numbers ( singular or plural . ) for nouns as well as verbs . We embedded some heuristic rules in KBS and dictionary to add these syntactic features  , if they must not be missed in the German text . There still exists deeper semantics which rules the decisions  , but cannot be represented in general , except for very limited cases . Heuristic rules are based on our ambiguity conservation principle  , i . e . we keep the ambiguity of input text as much as possible to avoid any active selection of one alternative  , that might lead to a wrong expression from the viewpoint of the author of the titles  . Following examples how typical errors of numbers and articles generated by the present SEMSYN heuristics  . 
They also illustrate how difficult it is to find a tradeoff between the ambiguity conservation and an active decision infered from the content : E  . g . l:~J~I~?m$~-C0)i ~0\[~74 ,   y~7"In~Y~Zs0~ SEMSYNK ~ eneration : Die Verwendun ~ yonkleinen Computern zur Dureh fue hrung vong_rgssen ~graphischen 
Programnlen ( The application of ~ nall_ . cg . .mRuter ? for the execution of lar ege~~ggramms ) Comment : The author of the paper will discuss how to use a small computer to execute a very large graphic package  , so readers may naturally assume one small computer instead of many small computers  , though it is possible to assume the latter . On the other hand , it is ge-nerally assumed that a computer processes many programms  . 
For this reason the latter plural case is more natural than tile former case  . However , it is a bad German to have neither a number feature nor an article as it is in the original text  .

2) ~ IJ it of ~' unctions
One of the hard problems we expected in our semantic conjunctions in an attributive context such as : < AP > A  , B and C < PP > . 
E . g . 3 high speed bus , memory and switching in bits lice technology The scope of context could be made unique  , if the semantic network could allow such a node which denotes a subnetwork  . The following conjunctive subnetwork is classified into three basic cases : < arcI > -- --@-----< enurn > ----~@---~  arc2>   ( i ) < arc l > ----- ( ~  .   .   .   .   . < enum > --~------< arc2 > E . g . 4  .   . efficient algorithm and computation for parallel processors  ( ii ) ~< arcl --> ~--- A ~ enula )  -  .   .   .   .   . ~---~\[---~ arc2)E . g . 5  .   . new algorithm and computation by a vector processor E  . g . 6 , . high-speed bus and memory management by stacks In practice  , however , we found that 90% of about 380 titles which contain conjunctions among 2000 titles of argenerated from the given semantic networks belong to the case  ( i )  ; only about 8% are the case ( ii ) , and the rest is the case ( iii ) . This statistic results may be spesific for the titles  , but this indicates that authors of titles are aware of the syntactic structural ambiguity and consequently try to avoid the above straightforward sequence of conjunctions except for the case  ( i )  . 
Beside this statistic sample-based facts , the conjunctive ambiguity is further weakened by the fact that the generation system produces ambiguous titles according to our ambiguity conservation principle to let expert readers naturally infer which is meant by the author  . 
At the moment we deal with the both cases ( ii ) and did by exploiting this possibility to convey the ambiguity so as if it were the ease  ( i )  . 
Ti mugh this conjunctive ambiguity in semantic networks seemed to be a serious factor at our first glance on them  , it fortunately turned out to be a very minor problem as the evaluation study indicates  . 
3) ~ c_problem
Generally speaking , a semantic based generation approach has a strong advantage as well as disadvantage ill terms of sentence styles  . The stylistic advantage is based on the large freedom of interpreting a given semantic representation  . A serious disadvantage is the exactly the other side of this interpretation freedom  . Following examples illustrate typical stylistic problems of our generation system : E  . g . 7PDIL~1~7'~\]"~ff ) ~ ~ , ~_ ~ I / --' , % /= ~ I/ , SEMSYN generation : Spezifikation , Simulation und Entwicklung von Protokollel ~ fuer die PDIL verwen detwer den  , fuer die Kommunikation ( Specification , simulation and development of proto-kol , for which PDIL is applied , for the communication ) Comment : " fuer die PDIL verwen detwer den , ~ uer die Kommunikation . " should be expressed as " . . sines Kommunikationsprotokolls unter Verwendung v on PDIL  . " ( " . . of a communication protocol by using PDIL " , instead of " for which PDIL . . . ) SEMSYN generation : Die Repraesentation yon Infor-mationen  , dieable it barine in emSpeicherge we senwer den . 
( The representation f informations , which can be derived in a memory ) Comment : The clause " . ., die ableitbar . ." should be replaced by an adjective phrase ' iron der aus dem 
Speicherable ibaren Information " .

Oberflae chen des Kohlen dioxid lasers ( The application of database systems for the listing of conditions for the surface hardening procedure with  CO2 laser . 
Comlaent : Instead of repeating nominalized case frames for role purpose " Verfahren zur Aufstellung " and " Verfahren zur Verstaerkung " should the latter be expressed as " Oberflae chenver haerterungs verfahren " Thoughbad styled expressions may transmit he correct meaning  , they substantially reduce the understandability of the generated texts  . The stereotypical bad styles can be easily improved ill some cases  ; however , the style conversion problems seem to have its inherent continuous depth from " easy to patch " to the infinite depth to be pursued in a long run  . 
4) Cultural difference problems
Before we started the project we discussed many problems that arc specifically attributed to the wellknown cultural difference  . In the following given are some of the real problems we encounted in dealing with title translations : i  ) Focus shift We have frequently to come up with the difference of focussing  , that forces us in a conflict situation whether we should prefer fidelity of the translation to the common style of German titles  . 
E . g . lO~1~7" la-~ , ,' X O )  ~  ( ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ SEMSYN generation : Die Verw endungy on Semantiken zur Spezifikation von Kommunikations prozessen  ( The application of semantics for specification of communication processes  ) Comment : The original Japanese text does not contain an explicit word that coreponds to the semantic symbol " USE  . ACT ", that is infered by tile analyzer . 
Generally speaking , however it sounds better in German if a expression explicates the meaning in a more resolved form  , while ambiguous expressions or even fuzzy expressions are prefered in Japanese  . In this example the purpose arc expressed as " zur " implies the application of the semantics  . 
ii ) Reversed causality
Tile most striking case that exemplifies the opposite relation between east and west is the reversed expression of causality  , mostly would be results are used instead of the cause in Japanese and vice versain west  . 
Following example demonstrates the fact : SEMSYN generation : Problems beider Ausbil dungueber Lehrer  , die spezielles Computer wissen besitzen , inner halb sines Schul systems . 
( Problems of training teachers , who own special computer knowledge , within the school systems ) that the special computer knowledge is a result of the training  . If the teachers have already this special knowledge  , they don't need the training . Therefore , it must be expressed as " so as to have . ." At the moment neither our analyzer nor generator can afford such a deep understanding of input texts  . Our approach is still open to enrich the TRAIN scheme to represent causal relation of the TRAIN concept which forces to reverse the causality of given meaning  . 
HI . Evaluation
About 20% of the translation results produced from the available semantic networks are evaluated  . In order to avoid them is understanding it is worth to make it clear that this evaluation was not done by the socalled blind test  , instead , all semantic networks are already used as our training samples  . This is because at the time when the evaluation study started we had only  2000 semantic networks available . The evaluation results are summarizes as follows :
Grade Fidelity Grammaticality i 68 . 0% 16 . 7% 2 29 . 7% 48 . 0% 3 2 . 3% 19 . 0% 4 0 . 0% 16 . 3% 5 0 . 0% 0 . 0%

Grade Grammaticality i : Exactly the same meaning as the original text  2: Almost same content 3: Still acceptable and informative 4: Only partially acceptable 5: Nothing to do with the content of the original text 
Grade Fidelity 1: Correct style , syntax and morphology 2: Correct syntax and morphology , but stylistic defect and vice versa 3: Still readable , but substantial mistakes in syntax , morphology and style 4: Almost unreadable as German text 5: Not German Based on this evaluation results we sorted our error sources  . Following results show the error classification from which the readers can figure out the development state of our system  . 
Error classification Occurrence among 300 titles
Fidelity ( a ) Lexicon ( not standard terms , in appropria terms ) ; I05 ( b ) Selection of prepositions 89 ( c ) Word construction ( noun compounds )  88  ( d ) Articles ( def . , indef . , )50(e ) Number ( sing . , plur . ) 43  ( f ) English terms ( technical terms instead of German )  27  ( g ) Relative clause instead of Np , PP 19 ( f ) Focus 15 ( h ) " Unter Verwendung von " 10 ( i ) Possessive attribute " von " instead of genetive 8 
Grammatieality ( i ) Selection of preposit 34 ( ii ) Word compounds 23 ( iii ) Articles 14 ( iv ) Relative clauses 12 ( vi ) Conjunction alignment 5 ( vii ) Numbers 4 ( viii ) Attributes 3 The above classification indicates that dictionary problem cannot be solved in a short term  . Especially in our approach , a semantic symbol generally corresponds to an upper concept  , under which an appropriate German term is registered as a specialization  . Therefore the terminology selection within a lexical entry is indirectly done through its context  . Again , this very advantage of expression freedom causes a bad selection of a target word  . We need time to polish our semantic German terminology database so that system can select right German words in general  . 
The noun compound is a specific problem in German . By constructing a noun compound a stylistic problem may elegantly be solved  ( cf . e . g . 9 , I0) , because otherwise using a modifier ( possessive attributes , qualifiers and quantifiers , etc ) results in a nawful expressions that cannot be compared with an alignment of English terms  . 
We also found a conflict situation in connection wilh the selection of technical ~ t ~' ms  . While we prefered common English technical terms in the field of informalion processing as CS experts for tlle reason of easy understanding  , evaluators emphasize the authority of nation-al standard technical terms  ( DIN )  , e . g . CRT ( Datensicht-geraet) , realtime ( echtzeit ) , etc . 
The reason why the German ideom " unter Verw endung yon " was frequently used can be attributed to the semantic symbol " USE  . ACT " , often infered ( about I0%) by the analysis ystem . ( Note : USE . ACT covers " verwen ( use ) " , " anwenden ( apply ) " , "Gebrauch machen ( make use of ) " , bulalso<instrument > arc for " mit(with ) " , " nitHil ? eyon(with the help of ) " , etc ) . This means that the explication of USE . A CT of an implied meaning in the original Japanese text may either elucidate the situation in German  ( this is often the case ) or make expression harder . 
By the same token a postpositional phrase or adjective phrase of an original text may awkwardly be expressed in a German relative clause  . As the modifier and USE . ACT cases above mentioned , exemplify the situation , the overanalysis and overexpression are specific to our semantic based approach and could be avoided in other transfer approaches  . 
IV . Conclusion
We discussed some problems of our semantic based approach  . 
Many of them are also common to other a proaches . However , our approach seems to be open for continuous improvement in dealing with these problems  . 
We express our sincere thanks to the ATLAS/It group of Fujitsu Laboratory  , Kawasaki for making semantic representations available for our generation
