Abstract
We describe an approach to semiautomatic lexicon development from nachine read al  ) ledictionaries with specific reference to verbal diatlleses  , envisaging ways in which tile results obtained can be used to guide word classification in the con-strnction of dictionary data l  ) ases . 
1 Introduction
The acquisition and representation of lexical knowledge from machine-readable dictionaries and text corpora have increasingly become major concerns in Computational Lexicography /Lexicology  . While this trend was essentially set by the need to mmximize cost-effectiveness in building large scale Lexical Knowledge Bases for NLP  ( LKBs )  , there is a clear sense in which the construction of such knowledge I  ) ascs also caters to the demand for better dictionaries  . Currently available dictionaries and thesauri provide an undoubtedly rich source of lexical information  , but often omit or neglect to make explicit salient syntactic and semantic properties of word entries  . For exanp lc , it is wellknown that the same verb sense can appear in awtriety of snl  ) cat-egorization frames which can be related to one at other through valency alternations  ( diatheses )  . Some dictionaries provide subcategorization information by means of grammar codes  , as shown below for the " sail " sense .

semantic specifications encoded in MRDs into LKB types  . For example , the choice of LKB types used in the characterization f the verbs wim above was induced from the syntactic and semantic codes found in LDOCE and tim Longman Lexicon of Contemporary English  ( LLOCE , McArtllur 1980) . In LI ) OCE , the first sense of the verbs wimis marked , ' us a strict intransitive verb ( \[ I0\] ) whose subject is animate ( ( box .   .   .   . 0)); in LLOCE , the same verb sense is semantically classified as a movement verb with manner of motion specified  ( M 19 ) :  ( 3 ) swim 1 ( 1 )

Acquisition
In the example discussed above , MI~D-to-LKB conversion is relatively straightforward : a single LKB entry is created for swim since a single grammar code is found in the MRD sources used  . Where a verb-sensentry gives more than one grammar code  , however , the question arises whether or not each grammar code should be mapped into a distinct LKB entry  . For example , the codes given in LDOCE for the verb dock ( see ( 1 ) ) could potentially be used to derive four LKB verb entries :  ( s ) LKBTYPF , EXAMPLI , ; a . striet-trans-sign Kim docked the boat b . obl-trans-slgnKim docked the boat at Southampton c  . striet-in trans-sign The boat docked d . obl-intrm xs-sign The boat docked at

Notice , however , that in tlliscase the creation of four distinct LKB entries is unnecessary in so far  , as the use of the verb exemplified in ( 5b ) contains enongh information to derive the remaining uses of the verb through lexical rules which progressively reduce the verb's valency by dropping the subject and/or preposition alar -gument  ( s )  . Such a step would be linguistically motivated in that it establishes a clear link between alternative uses of the same verb sense  . Moreover , compact representation of verb use extensions i desirable from an engineering perspective its it reduces the size of ttm lexicon  , allowing verb use expansion to be delayed till parsing time  . This practice can be made to facilitate the resolution of lexical ambiguity by enforcing selective application of lexical rules  ( Copestake & Briscoe ,  1994) . 
Compact representation of verb use extensions due to valency alternations requires that a note of all applicable lexical rules be made in each kernel entry  . In choosing ol ) l-trans-slgn as the LKB type for dock , for example , specifications would be added saying that the verb is a menabh ~" to the causative-inchoative alternation relating agentive and agent less uses  ( (5a , b ) vs . (5c , d )) , and the path alternation pertaining to the omission of the prepositional argument  ( (5a , c ) vs . 
(5b , d)) . In addition , the path alternation would ha ~ ( e to be specified as to whether it preserves a menability to a telic interpretation  ( accomplishment or achieve-men ) of the event described by the verb or not . For example , tile omission of the goal argnment for a verb such as drive  , push or carm j induces an atelic ( process ) interpretation as indicated by incompatibility with a terminative adverbial :  ( 6 ) a . , \] ohn drove his carto London in one hour b . Johndrovehisear ( * in one hour ) Within a ( partial ) deeom posltional pproach to verb semantics ( Tahny , 1985; Jackendolr , 1990; Sanfilippo , 1993; Sanlilil ) poelal . , 1992)) , this contrast can be explained with reference to the rneaniug component path  . In (6a ) , the goal argument ( 1o London ) fixes a final bound for the path along which the driving event takes place  . Assuming that , the compositional meaning of tile sentence involves establishing a homomorphism between tile event described by the verb and the path along which such an event takes place  ( l ) owty , 1991; Sanlilippo ,  1991) , it follows that with an unbounded path ( e . g . (6b )) only a process interpretation is possible , whereas with a bounded path ( e . g . (6a )) are licinter pretation is more likely . P , y contr~t , the omission of the goal argument with verbs such  , and eliver , bring , dock and send does not inhibit a menability to a relic interpretation  , e . g . 
(7 ) We can deliver the goods ( to your door ) in one hourt inctnses of the same verb sense by relating the subcategorization frames relative to these uses via regular syntactic and semantic hanges  . ' lbiLs sess the feasibility of this approach , we attgmented the MtH ) -to-LKB conversion code with facilities which make it possible to infer a menability to specific diathesis alternations from occurrence of multiple grammar codes and their ~ ssociated semantic odes in the MR  , Ds . To improve on the informational content of LDOCE grammar codes  , we used an intermediate dictionary semiant on mtically derived from LDOCE  ( LI ) OCE Anter ) where the subcategorization information inferrabl c from grammar codes and other orthographic onventions wi~s made more explicit  ( Boguraev & Briscoe , 1989; Carroll & Grovel 1989) . Semantic inlbrmation about verb classes was obtained by mapping across LI  ) OCF , and II , LOCE so as to augment LI ) OCE queries with thesaurus information , i . e . semantic odes ( Santilippo &
Poznafiski , 1992).
Syntactic and semantic intbrmation relative to verb senses was extracted through special functio  , ~s which operate on pointers to dictionary entries  . The extracted infow as used to generate FS representations of word senses  . The coll version process was carried out in such a way that whenever multiple subcategorization frames were found in association with a verb sense  , only those which could not be derived via diathesis alternation were expanded into LKII entries  , l ; brexample , the LDOCE Anterentry for dock gives four subeategorization frames :  ( dock )   ( ( ( Cat V )   ( Takes NP )   ( Type 1 ) )  ( ( Cat 7 )   ( Takes NP PP )   ( Type 2 )   ( PFtlRHat ) )  ( ( (  ; at 7 )   ( Takes NP NP )   ( Type 2 Transitive ) )  ( ( Cat 7 )   ( Takes NP NP PP )   ( Type 3 )   ( PF\[\]RH at )   )   ) In this case , the four uses of the verb can all be derived from the last one through application of the causative -inchoative and bounded-path alternations mentioned above  ; all that , ceds doing is to mark what diatheses are possible in the LKB entry derived  , e . g .

In perform-lug this check , snb categorization ptions relative to a given verb sense which can be inferred from a more informative subcategorization frame are ignored  . This technique was successfidly employed in semiautomatic derivation of lexicons for  360 n  ~ ow . ' n~ent verbs yieldiug over 500 additional possible expansions by application of lexical rules  . 
4 Verbal Diatheses and Knowledge

To encode a menability to verbal diathescs , the feature D1ATHESES wiLs introduced ; Ls an extension of the morphological features ~ Lssoeiated with verbs  ( see ( 8 ) ) . This feature takes as value the type altem , a-lions which is in turn ( teiine ( l , ' ks having awtriety of specialized types according to which diathesis alternations are admissible for each choice of verb type  ( e . g . 
intransitive , transit . ive , ditransitive ) , ~ u shown in Figure 3 ( see next page) . The following table provides dia theses refi~rred to inl " ig  3  .

enforcing diathesis alternations may involw ~ a variety of syntactic  , semantic and orthographic hanges . For example , the u-path-ohl-in trans-alt rule shown in Fig  5 I ) elow takes as input an I"S of type obl-intrans -sign which represents a verb describing a nonstative eventuality  ( dyn-eve ) whose subject participant ( with semantics KI ) is implied as moving along a directed path ( th-move-dir ) the endpoint of which is speci-tled by the oblique a  , ' gument ( pp-sign ) , e . g . the use of swim in Kimswam acTvss the river . The output is an FS representing a strict intransitive verb  ( striet-in trans-sign ) which describes a process and whose subject participant is like that of the inlutt with the directed path speciIication removed  ( th-move instead of th-mow ~- dir )  , e . g . swim in Kimswam ) .

First , the links between LKB types and dictionary entries established in the conversion stage can be used to run consistency cheeks on tile MRI  ) sources and to supply missing information or correct errors  , This offers an efficient and cost-effective way of generating improved versions of the same  ( lietionary . 
Second , the types associated with specific word classes can he made to guide lexical aquisition from corpora when creating new dictionaries  . It is now widely recognized that corpora are indispensable in the acquisition of lexica I information relating to issues of usage such as the range and frequency of different patterns of syntactic realization  . ' FILe availability of software tools for partial analysis of texts e  . g . 
morphological nd semantic tagging , phrasal parsing etc . ) has increased significantly the utility of corpora in lexical acquisition by providing ways to structure the information contained in them  ( see Briscoe 199 l ) and references therein )  , l'h ~ r the radvances yet can be made by using LKB types to chLs sify words in text e of p or a  . Suplmse , for example , we lit , ked the input and on tl ) ut of lexical rules to semantically tagged subcategorization frames extracted from bracketed corpora  ( Poznafiski & Sautillppo ,  1993) . As indicated in Fig 6 , this would allow us to assess which alternations might be of interest in establishing regular verb sense/usage shifts  . Such an assessment wonhl provide an effective way to drive verb categorization from corpora in the domain of valency alternations  . 
6 Final Remarks
A key element in our approach to \] exica\[ acquisition and representation fverbal diathesis concernstimuse of semantics constraints in formulating MII  ) queries and characterizing FS descriptions . This practice n-sttrest hat the results achieved in this work for  , n ( > tiou verbs can be suitably extended to other semantic verb classes  . For example , the c\[tuss of verbs which undergo " extraposition " - - e  . g . That Kimleft early both-ers Suevs . It bothers 5'ue that Kim left early -- can be identified by using semantic on straints on  MK1  ) queries which identify psychological verbs with stimu-Ills subject such as bother  , please , etc . ( Sanfilippo & Poznatiski , 1992) . This approach provides an effective way of employing semiautomatic extraction of information from MIt  , 1)s for lexicon construction , and it facilitates word classification from text corpora when co  , npiling new dictionary data b~es .
