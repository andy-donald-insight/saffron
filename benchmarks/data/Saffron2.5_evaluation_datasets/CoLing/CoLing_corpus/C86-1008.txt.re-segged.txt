In this paper a two level dialogue representation system is presented ? It is intended to recognize the structure of a large range of dialogues including some nonverbal communicative acts which may be involved in an interaction  . It provides a syntactic description of a dialogue which can be expressed in terms of re-writ ing rules  . The semantic level of the proposed representation system is given by the goal and subgoalst ructure underlying the dialogue syntactic units  . Two types of goal are identified ; goals which relate to the content of the dialogue  , and those which relate to corma unicating the content ? i  . INTRODUCTION Research on computational modelling of discourse has highlighted some important aspects of hun ~ andialogic communication  . In some cases ( Reichman ,  1984) , a structural description of linguistic communication has been attempted alt klough not for proper dialogue  . 
What is required is a structural descript ion identifying a corresponding set of con ~nunicative acts which can be confined in a fixed pattern  , to form higher level communication act categories or dialogue constituents  . 
The importance of such a structural description , if attained , is that it would make possible an axiomatic theory of dialogue  , embedding rhetorical patterns , focusing , and focus shifting . 
A possible basis for such a structural description is Burton's  ( 1981 ) taxonomy of communication acts , with some modifications . 
Such a formalization of dialogue , however , is a fully syntactic one which needs to be augmented with some semantics  . Our assumption is that dialogue constituents have a semantic interpretation in terms of goals and subgoals  . 
A theoretical frame for a dialogue classification system based on these assunptions is being developed with the aim of providing a coherent basis for the computational modelling of dialogue  . 
The final aim of our project is , in fact the design and implementation of a computational dialogic interaction system  , with the ability to recover fr~n communication failure  . 
2. STRUCZURAL DESCRIPTION
The syntactic level of a dialogue description system has to meet three requirements :  ( a ) It must consist of a model whose generality makes it applicable to both person person and  1This research was supported in part by the ESPRIT progranme of the CEC under contract AIP  P527  . 
person-machine dialogues , irrespective of the socio-institutional disposition of any speaker/user  . 
( b ) It must be capable of describing in terms of communication concepts the i~teractive nature of dialogue exchanges  . 
( c ) It must be capable of " naming " the units which compose the dialogue exchanges  , i . eo identifying an utterance as both of a particular type and playing acez % a in role in a particular exchange  . 
The dialogue units taxonomy proposed by Burton ( \] . 981) seems to satisfy these requirements . 
According to her analysis systen\[we distinguish four hierarchically related levels : the interaction ~ which is the largest unit  ; the transaction ; the exchange ; the move ; and the act . An interaction consists of a number of transactions  , a transaction consists of a number of exchanges , and so on . ~e smallest interactive unit in this system is the move  . A move can consist of a number of linguistic and nonlinguistic " acts " which are realised either as utterances or physical actions  . 
2.1 ACTS
An act is a way of classifying utterances which occur in a conversational move  . The act is a level above that of the utterance , and a move can consist of a number of acts . For example , ~le following is an opening n~veby at eacher in a classroom dialogue consisting of two acts  ( in brackets ) : T : those letters have a special name ( Starter ) do you know what it is ( Elicitation ) Most acts are realised by a wide range of utterance types ? For example  , the act called ' starter ' can be realised by either a statement  , question , conra and , or a moodless item . 
we distinguish the following 15 acts , marker , summons , silent stress , starter , metastatements , conclusion , informative , elicitation , directive , comment , accept , reply , react , acknowledge , preface , prompt , null . Their definition is always given in terms of both linguistic structure and function  . 
Thus , for instance , the starter act , whose structure has been described above , has the function of providing information about , directing attention to , or thought towards an area , in order to increase the likelihood of making a correct response to the subsequent initiation  . An informative act has the structure of a state a ~ nt and serves the function of providing information  . Some of these acts are more directly relevant to the problem of analysing person machine dialogues than others  . However , together they provide a broadfran ~ work , incorporating both verbal and nonverbal aspects of dialogue  , within which we can situate a detailed analysis of the more relevant acts  . 
42 2.2 MOVES
At a higher levels even types of move are recogn ized : delineating  , sketching , opening , supporting , challenging , bound-opening , and re-opening . 
Moves are the basic units of adyadic exchange and can consist of ant nn be ro facts  . We will define the various moves in a semi-fo rmalmanner  . ' fhe formalism is a type of context-sensitive grammar  . 
If an element is enclosed in \] it indicates that the item is optional  . The symbol I indicates that the elements it separates are alternatives  . If an element is enclosed in <> it indicates that the symbol is non-terminal and requires further expansion  . The following is the formal description of a sketching move : < sketching move > < signal > < prehead > < head > :=\ [< signal >\] < prehead >\ ] < head > := marker Isu ~ nons := starter := metastatement I conclusion Similar descriptions are also given for the other moves  . 
In addition to these standard conventions we adopt a special convention to illustrate the effects of context  . ~ is takes the form:
C\[<argl > < ~ g2>\]:=expansion
Where C is a function which , when evaluated , expands < arg2> subject to something being true of < argl > . 
For example , we might want to restrict the expansion of < arg2> ~ only those situation in which < argl > has already occurred as an act in the previous move  . 
This can be accomplished by an appropriately defined 
C function ? 2.3 EXCHANGES
Sequences of moves compose an exchange . According to Burton two types of exchange are distinguished : explicit boundary  ( EB ) exchanges and conversational ( C ) exchanges . Explicit boundary exchanges occur , as their name suggests , at the boundary of transactions . They can include delineating and/or sketching moves which must be supported by another speaker  . 
Conversational exchanges consist of chains of opening  , challenging and/or supporting moves . EB exchanges have the following structure : < EB -exchange > := < delineating move > < sketching move > < supporting move > f fhestructure of a C -exchange is as follows : < C-exchange > := < initiation >\[ < supporting move > < bound -opening move > < supporting move > < supporting move > l\]m\]n \] < initiation > := < opening move >l < challenging move > l < re-opening > The superscr ipts i  , m , and n represent sets of numbers of repetitions ~ Where \[" contains m numbers  , m contains n numbers v and n ~ on sists o ~ just one ~ umber  . Th ~ numbers , the-repetition factors themselves , can range from 0 upwards . However , when n is 0,m and 1 are also 0 . This arr ~\] gement allows ~ stoge-nerat ~ a different bound-opening/supporting pattern for each m  . 
2.4 TRANSACTIONS ANDINTER ACTIONS
Transactions and interactions are the final two levels of the classification hie rarchy  . 
Transactions consist of patterns of exchanges , and interactions consist of unordered str ings of transactions  . Transactions have the following form : < transaction > := < EB-exchange > 
C\[<opening n ~ ) ve > < C-exchange >\] C\[<challenging move > < C -exchange>\]C\[<re-opening move > < C-exchange >\ ] lm The C function in this case expands its second argument if the first argument  , a move , is the initiator of the C-exchange . 
Finally interactions t~ke the form : < interaction > :=< transaction >  1   3  . % ~ ECOMV ~\] NICATIVE COMPONENT The following two assumptions form the basis for a pairing of a dialogue planning mechanism with elexents of the clialogue description system : dialogue participants always have two cooperating types of goals  , substantive real life goals ( S-goals ) , which determine " what to say " , and linguistic/communicative goals ( C-goals ) , which determine " how to say it " . No relation of necessity seems to hold between them  . In fact , in most cases there are many different ways of expressing the same goal  . 
it is possible to identify hierarchical relations between goals and subgoals both for substantive and communicative goals  . However , in the high level dialogue description system units S-goals  see/~1 to be more important , while at the low levels
C-goal seem to prevail.
The highest level of the discourse structure is the transaction  . Given that the dialogue as a whole is a means of effecting the high-level goals of one or other of the participants  , we can functionally define transaction as the unit of dialogue concerned with effecting these high-level goals  . 
At the highest lewi . ~l of the dialogue's goal structure the dominant goals motivating the transaction are those concerned with the substance of the dia logue  , not the means by which the substance is conveyed  . As we move down this hierarchy it is possible to discerna bifurcation of goals into one group concerned with the substance of the dialogue  , and the other concerned with communication of this substance  . These are the S-goals and C-goals ( or more properly , S and C subgoals ) mentioned above . 

A transaction is always motivated by a general goal such as seek information  , make a train journey ( Allen ,  1982) , make a reservation . The social context , for example the relation between speaker and hearer or simply a social convention  , can suggest rhetorical choices . Among these might be the direct stating of the general goal  , the indirect revelation of the general goal by several related questions  , the questioning of a system's general capabilities before asking  , and so on . 
Essentially , exchanges can be thought of as the topic-bearing elements of the dialogue  . New topics are introduced by either an EB -exchange  ( explicit boundary )  , a C-exchange ( conversational ) with an opening move as its first move , or a C-exchange with a challenge as its first move  . Topics that have been discussed prior to the most recent challenge are re-introduced by a C-exchange with a re-opening move as its first move  . Topics that have been discussed less recently are re-introduced by means of an EB-exchange containing a sketching move  . 
There is , therefore , a strong connection between the exchangest ructure of the transaction and the pattern of topic-shifts in the dialogue  . These topic-shifts , in turn , are related to the conversant's shifting goal structure  . This is especially true in task-oriented dialogues  , where the component operations of the task are mirrored in the topic structure of the dialogue  ( Grosz ,  1981) . 
A general goal can be , therefore , split into a sequence of subgoals b of/n because the task consists in reality of a sequence of subtasks  ( Grosz , 1981) and because of rhetorical reasons . This gives a very special status to exchanges in our classification system  . A transaction is in fact , divided into several exchanges determined either by the structure of the task to be carried out  , or by rhetorical considerations , or by both . In particular , we should distinguish between two types of exchange : - a subtask exchange  , which aims at reaching some substantive subgoal- an instrumental exchange  , which aims at attaining some communicative ( sub ) goal , such as introducing the terms of the conversation  , or clarifying some unclear substantive goal or subgoal  . 
Every exchange is conloosed of moves and is , in most cases , opened by some form of topic shifting move and c losed by a concluding move  . Other sabcategories of exchanges can be found . However , a pattern of moves is associated with every exchange  . 
At this level different rhetorical cho ices  ( motivated by C-goals ) may appear in the form of different distr ibutions of instrumental or non-clarifying exchanges within a transaction  . The S-goals of an exchange can be computed from the interpretation of the utterances comprising it  , utilising some notion of general focus ( Sidner ,  1979) . 
At a lower level , the goals that motivate the moves are drawn equally from S-goals and C-goals  . At the move level , the S-goal structure becomes less relevant to the sequence of moves  . Moves are mostly rhetorical elements . They signal the pushing to a ( new ) topic ( topic shifting and topic reintroducing moves )   , the continuation of a topic ( topic introduction )  . 
Pushing and popping are the opening and closing moves of an exchange  . The coherence of the topic is to be expected within an exchange and should be perhaps checked from one move to the other  . A topic shift is in itself a pushing move . The notion of topic probably coincides with the notion of focused goal  . 
Moves serve as syntactic components of exchanges and every move is a step in a linguistic goal structure  . 
Therefore , every exchange consists of a pattern of moves representing the communicative choices of the dialogue participants  . In some cases , there is a correspondence between the S-goal associated with an exchange and some move  ( challenge )   . Also a communicative adherence between one move and the following should hold  . Coherence means that the topic must be roughly the same  , while adherence moans that the given move can be followed only by a specific set of moves  . 
Finally , an act is a limited linguistic act , uttered to effect very local communicative /rhetoric goals  . 
In a dialogue most moves consists of a single act , but this does not . always hold . A distinction can be made at the act level between acts which are drawn from a limited class of utterances  , and acts which are not limited in this way . We will call these closed and open classes , respectively . Most of the closed class items are associated with acts which subserve C-goals rather than S -goals  . This is not too surprising since the items from the closed class do not usually convey substantive information but usually serve as go -ahead signals in a dialogue  . 
Whereas the primary function of open class items is to convey task-relevant information  . 
4 . SYNTACTICSTRUCTURE AND GOALST RUCTURE From the previous paragraph it has been clear that there is a different distribution of S and C-goals a long the hierarchy of dialogue units  . In particular , higher level units are more related to S-goals , while low level units are connected to C-goals . 
The model presented is intended to serve mainly descriptive and representational purposes  . No definition is given of the process of inference of the goal structure from the syntactic structure of dialogue  . However it is possible to imagine that such a process rely  , among others , on-the functions assigned to ~ ialogue subunits -the actions mentioned in any specific utterance  . 
5. CONCLUSIONS ANDPERSPECTIVES
The advantages of the proposed dialogue description system are the following : - the design of a grammar for the description of dialogue units and subunits is made possible  ; -the distinction between S-and C-goals allows the treat a ~ nt of possible interrupt and clar if ication subdialogues in the same frame as the goal directed parts of the dialogue  ; Further research will be devoted to the speci fication of a more detailed grammar of exchanges and moves  , and to the establishing of a stricter correspondence between more types of goals  . 
However , a still more important point to be clarified is the specification of the  for1~al devices by which the semantic ( goal ) structure can be inferred from utterance and act elements and ' raised ' to the higher dialogue units  .
