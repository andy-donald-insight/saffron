Abstract
A proposal is made for the use of contextual information in the machine translation of Japanese and English  . This paper describes the use of a Context Monitor to nlaintaill contextual in fortmt-tion dyn  , ' unically and the ~ tugmenlalion of appropriate features to ~ t semantic network to enah h ~ simple inference  . The alproach taken is that t " " best gucs ~?' processing with the cont ~ extual information being hal~dled with semantic inf ~ rmalion on ~ shallow level  . 
2 Introduction
Current Machine qh ' anslatiou(MT ) systems proc , ~ss input sentence by sentence . I\[o wever , experience wil . h English and Japanese has shown that some languages difl'er to such a degree that sentential translation yiehls poor results  , l , e Lusfirst compare the results of a conventional MT sysl  . em with those we expect , t , oget for MT with context : t .

An attempt has therefore Ieen made to solve some of tile problems of translal  . ing languages SllCIts is Japanese and English using contextual information  .

'\]' he current , dictionaries conl , ~dn information to trans-lal . e aboul ; 300 words . There are 350 grammar rules which ( : own ' a wide range of sentence pal , terns . 
The context monil , or operates using information retrieved from file f-sLrueturc of  ; tSOlli . eltCeal't(W analysis . This ilf for lnal . ion is then used during the transfer 2'\['\[le cn'igimdlm , gl . anlforl ; ; hgllnh-Spanlshiranslall cm de-veh , p , ,d I , y(1 , Amm'es\[:\m ,   wes'89\] has been widely adapted and eldal'ged Io .

As context processing is carried out on only a shallow level  , only information for lexical item , nurnber , person , gender , case role et c is used in the context system , along with semantic in Ii ) rtnation from the semantic network . The way that this information is used will be explained below in regard to the specific problems that tile use of context is intended to resolw ~  . 
4 The Context Monitor
The context monitor proposed in this pal ) eruses a standard focussing theory as a basis ( \[ Sidner 81\] )  , \[Sid , ler8(i \]) , amloughs on rexvhat simplified according to the bes*:press approach that we are adopting  . It is planned to increase the COml~lexily of this initial algorithm to reflect more current wn ' sions of the theory as the system is developed  . 
The context monitor has a number of basic data structures : Current l  ; k ) cus , Actorl ' ~ oeus , Potential , ' o-cusList , Potential Actor I ; ' ocusList , Discourse Segment Stack and Actor I : ocus Stack . There is also a Current State List that maintains a record of all the semantic items currently hev l in any of the other data structures and the semantic features to wh Ml they are linked  . This list is updated ( entries added : rod removed ) after every sentence . 
In ord c'r to lilnlt the scope of the context information required in the context monitor  , an analysis was made of the main differences between  3apanese aml English that provide problen as for MT syst . ems . The basis of the analysis was to find what information can be gained from context to solve these problems  . 
4.1 Plural Fomns
Japanese is ( in general a ) mmlark c'd for mlmber . I '; n-glish , however , differentiates between singular and plural , q'h is fact causes problems when translating t ? om Japanese to English as the mlmber information required for the inflection and declension of English is not available from the analysis of the  3apanese   . I : or example : ( I , oy(s ), ,, ~, dog(s)o , , slille)
The boy likes th.e do ~ j .
The boW like the cloy.
The boylikes Zhedolls.
The bow like Hiedo ! Is.
Bogs like do as.
In the current system an initial sell t . ence analyzed by the system is processed to find possible : ff  ) ci . II , ents which are in the l ) lural or are in conjunction are stored as a set . ' Cheset as a whole is given phlral nultll ) er , a Note the use of . t'~('l(tchi ') with mainly people and an lm . ls , but consists of imlividual items or , as in the case of "/ we ~ e , v7' V models and fo ~ tr 7 ~ ew video models " , as subsets . Subsets or individual items within the sets are available as antecedents to subsequ  . et lt referring expressiolls . 
'\]_' hus , in the example text . in Section 1 , after the initial sentence is analysed , the proposed focus is two new TV models and fmtr new video models  , the strut . -lureo\["which is shown in Figure 3 below : 4 \[ sell:\[ set2: \[ pred:tere bi ( TV )  , llllll~l)\[lll'~nlod:\[pred:l . : ishu(model ), spee:\[pred:,li(Iwo ),_ . \]1\] , ref:set2\] , \[set3:\[pred:l ) ideo(video) , llllll ; phlr1mod:\[pred:kishu(model ) , 
SlmC:\[pred:yo ,, ( fiJwl9,- . \]\]\], rcf:set3\],,' of:set1\]l:igure3:PIi . Of , OG Structure Sentence 2 ( S ? ) is analysed and a test is made to see if any items in that sentence confirm or reject the proposed focus  . ' l'hestructure for the itemg '7" ~ ( " avideo/videos " ) is matched bymfiIication with the structure for the prol  ) osed focus and can Immatched with a subset of it . , namely ~) ik . v,/2"-)~- IJtl , ~ K ~\[((" dnew video models ") . That item is there . foretaken Io conll rm the proposed R ) t : us . 
That proposed I ' oeus is , however , hnmed httely PUS lled onto the focus stack because the subset of  4 vhleos is taken as the current \[' ocus 5  . ' Phe item 13-)~"; to f$2 inherits the feal . tlrcs of the set . of videos fron lSI . 
aml is there for expressed ill the I ( nglish with a plural form : " videos " . It is hoped that in this way the conlext monitor will be able to distinguish between singular all d plural in at least some cases  . 
II/sonic cases t , here is Iio way of disl . inlguishing between singular and l/lural rei ~ renee in  . Japanese as in tile case o\["thesel/tellce below : "/' eve  ( ~ ) 1?1 llm~al , : obO , : lhtaca\]w . . 7'l . ~ eyaleit " i ~ lhepark .

4  , 4 The Augmented Semant ic Net - work Tile semantic network in this system is basically a hierarchy of Objects  , States and Events . The addition of features to the semantic network in effect adds links to the network  . Two kinds of link are proposed : permanent links and temporary links  . Permanent'links are conditions that must be true for a certain action or state-of-affairs to bold  . The other , temporary , links are used to create a default state for the objects mentioned in the text  . As the text is processed , these links may change , so that the information awtilable to the system will differ from one sentence to the next  . 
4.4.1 The Links
The division between Objects , States and Events is reflected in tlle type of feature given to semantic it clnS  . 
For exain ple , Events typically coilgain features about the sort of things that are affected by that event  ; States contain information the types of objects that may be in that state  ; Objects contain iil for lnaiiou about any subparts or if they themselves are typically part of another  ( larger ) object and wli at type of
Event they are typically involved in.
On this basis , the following types of link are proposed : . Condition ( = c ) :  ( permanent ) a condition that must lold for a State or Event to come about  . 
, Before Condition ( BC:: ) :  ( pernian eut ) a condition that must be trlie before an Event or State conies about  . 
* After Condition(AC::):(permanent ) aco , ldition that becomes tr tie after an Event or State comes about  . 
* HasSubpart(l , as ) :  ( tenlporary ) an Object lias re--lated subparts or is a subpart of another Object  . 
* Characteristic ( has Semautic . Label ) : ( I . emliorary ) an Object has the characteristic of Senmntie_Lal ) el ( usually an Abstract_Relation : Size , Shape Colour etc . ) . This takes the form of : " lteni has Senlau - tie_Label "  , such as " Peler has Existel , ee Lif ~ span " . 
Tiffs states that an item witlltile semantic item Peter has an existence of some kind and filrther locates tllat iten lona path of the network to the abstract relation of lAfespan  . Iuthis way , nodes between these two points are all available for reference by the inference system  . 
. Ability ( able_to ) :  ( temporary ) This is not fully defined in tim current systenl but represents characteristic features of items e  . g . " doo F ' often appears in the tlleme position of tile Events Open aud  , O'hll\[ . 
These liuks are considered sutllcient fortile current capabilities of the system  . I , inks may be deleted or others added as the range of the sytem widens  , if this is tl lought necessary or desirable . 
4 . 4 . 2 Permanent . ( k Ten lporary L inks The dlfference between perrnallent and I  ; enll ) or ary links is iuthenature of the iuformation that they convey  . Permauent links are those that are augmented to tilellet work and COlllle Ctuo descue I  , otile other in accordance with the features found in those nodes  . 
~Bef ( ~ reCondition and Aries " Condition links are permanent  , although the hiformation contaiued in the uodes that  , t . hey connect to will only become awdl-able to the context nlonitoriu accordance with the tense al /d aspect of the verb  ( i . e . . all After Condi-lion is obviously only valid crier the completion of the  ( for exaln plc ) action denoted by a verb has finished . Teniporary liuks are those that supply defaulti ll for fllation to the COll text Il ~ Ollitor coucerning nodes that it is CO liCerlied wii  . h . ' Fhus , for exalu F , le > an entry for a birdiuight state that it is Able_ToFly  . l lowever , if the input text were to state that a particular bird is unable to fly  , that A1 Ao " l'o link would be cancelled . 
Thus to lllporary links provide the ili forulatioil that the colitext nlonitor rises > using the teinporary links to spread throughoilt the network  ( within set search constraints ) aild gat . hering in Poruiatio i i that C all lie used for inf creilcing  .

When the enibed ded clause is analysed , " Jolin " will be analysed in a similar way . The semantic feature human : yeslocates these l , wo lexical items as sub-surned by the semantic feature " Living " in the network  . Augmerited Feat in ' es Ibrama h ; bureau such as the objects relZ'rred to by the nanles Pcleraud Jolin are shown below in Figure d below along with possible entries for the l  , \] w ! nt die and the St~te be sad , Itca , l be seen that one of the Before Conditions o\[' the I'\]wmtDie is I  , hat the actor role is filled by all il , emI ; hath as the seilialllic feature " Living " .

Figure 4: Augmented l " eatures and therefore l , iving , l lowever , the After ( \] ontli Liol ; s of the Event Diecancel the feature laving lil connection with " John "  ( '~  o1' means that a \[? a ture a mlall tile other features underneath it in the tree should not be reachable by that item  )  , and state , that the item should be associated with the fimture " Corpse "  ( a semantic label in the system for something that was living but is no longer  )  . Thus the semantic item " John " is first linked with the semantic feature " llu-man " and all the other feat m'es inherited from that feature  . However , the features associated with the semantic item " Die " cause the links associated with " John " to change  . This means that when tile see-end sentence is analysed  , the possilf le candidates f ( )r the exl ) erieneer role of the semantic item " lhLSa ( f ' are analysed , an it mn with the semantic feature " All-inmte " will be sought  , and so the item " , / ok . " will not be considered in the . search as it is no long , -ronapa threachable hy " Animate . " . " Pete /' is therefore the only possible antecedent  . 
4. ~ Articles
Japanese does not used e . finite and indefinite arti-des and so when there is noow  . 'rt determiner in the aal ) anese , one must be supplied for the English translation . For example , Sentence 2 of ore " example text : 155" M " 1:111~3E l~llV-~l ~' , Ij : U /:: , , They passed the videos to the Sales , qeetion . 
Wherea simple default rule is used for articles , ibise ouhlequally be machine translated as : I\ ] te  9 llaSsed videos to the Sales Division ~ , where it can be co . sid-ered that some of the sense of the original seuteuce is lost  . 
While the use of contextual informat Dm canl ~ . t solve all of the prolf lems of art . Mes , it is hoped that at least in some eases incorrect possil  ) ililies ( : ; mI ) eeliminated ( following tile " l > est guess " policy )  . I 1 , lhecases that the context monitor cannot decide , an article , the MT system default will be re . liedup on . 
% decide between a definite and indefinite article in \] ' ~ nglish  , a simple rule of thumb in the present system is that once an object has been specified in a coi itex L  ,   6ttSstlnlillg that the noun is defined as phu ' all ) ysonic ( ~lher process , oL her wlse avt deoisals ~ al ) ossl bilily ; ill subsequent references to that par Lich h ~ r object in the saine context will be definiter  . 
In the method proposed here , as objects are analysed , they are giwma unique reference number ( r e * ) that separates theml ' ron ~ all other objects of file same type  .

5 Limitations g ~ Problems
As shown above , the inferencing carried out is very simple . It depends entirely on the links betwee nodes of the network and there is an obvious limit as to how complicated those links may I  ) eeome before the processing required to search all t  , he nodes linked to a particular item becomes prohibitiw ~'  . At , the current , stage of planning , a strnctnre ( a semanticil . eni ) may be linked to another via one node ( constrained lobean Abstract It . elation ) . There are no current plans I . o increase the number of such linking nodes . 
The inference mechanism is also expected to perform poorly where actions denoted by a wn'b are CO lll-plex  . This is due to the very simple feature descriptions that we use in the systenl  . It might therefore be desirable that , if the processing is not ccml pleted within , for example , a constrained time , the process be terminated and the context moii it , or left to rely on semantic feature matching alone . 
Another major problem is writing the features for the links in the network  . At the moment , all features are written by hand , ) t i t , it is hoped that s in lilar information might be extracted from semantic and case-fi'ame dictionaries  . 
The context monitor is currently written in PI I0-LOG   9  . The programe ui'rently consists of several hundred lines of PROLOG  . 
6 Final Remarks
