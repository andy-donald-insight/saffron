Abstract possibility of deictic VP ellipsis , inferrable antecedents , non-syntactically parallel antecedents , eases where the A computational ccount of VP ellipsis is described  , in antecedent is formed by combining two or more salient which VP's are represented in the discourse model as predicates  , and cases where the antecedent is sep a -contextually dependent semantic objects  . It is argued rated from the target by one or more intervening sen-that this approach can handle examples that are not tences  ( \[27\] , \[ ll \]) . However , existing semantic accounts allowed by alternative accounts  . An implementation is have important empirical problenm  . For example , I ar-defined in terms of extensions to the Incremental In-gue in  \[11\] that they do not permit pronouns to " switch terp retation System  . The treatment of VP ellipsis is reference " from antecedent to target in example such analogous to that of pronominal anaphora  . It is sug- as1: gested that the recency and salience constraints commonly though to apply to pronominal anaphora might apply in a similar way to VP ellipsis  . 
1 Introduction
Tim problem of verb phrasellips is can be divided into two subproblems : Problem  ( 1 ) : how is an antecedent selected ? Problem ( 2 ) : given a particular antecedent , how is it to be reconstructed at the ellipsis site ? Most work on VP ellipsis has dealt with Problem  ( 2 )  , concerning the copying or reconstruction of a particular antecedent  . A wide variety of approaches to this problem have been proposed  , including snrface structure accounts (\[141 ,  \[18\]) , " syntactic " LF (\[5\]) , and semantic (\[251 ,  \[28\] ,  \[15\] ,  \[21\] ,  \[4\] ,  \[23\] ,  \[24\]) . However , I will argue that there is a natura level of representation that has not been pursued  , which I will call the " properly semantic " level  . I will show that this alternative has significant empirical advantages over other approaches to Problem  ( 2 )  . In addition , the approach suggests some possible ways of addressing Problem  ( 1 )  , which concern selecting among alternative potential antecedents  . This problem has been largely ignored . 
There Is a variety of evidence that indicates that VP ellipsis is resolved at a semantic rather than syntactic level of representation  . This evidence includes the (1) a . It old John/that I didn't expect himit of ail hislexam  . 
b . It old Bill/that I did . \[ expect him/to fail his jexam \] Similarly , most existing accounts 2 do not permit a pronoun to be bound by different binders in antecedent and target  , as in: ( 2 ) Everyboyi in Bill's class hoped Mary would ask h imlout  , but a boyj in John's class actually knew that she would  . \[ ask himjout \] It is interesting to note that none of the existing semantic accounts qualify as " properly semantic " accord-lug to some fairly standard criteria  . The modifications required to comply with these criteria  , I will argue , are exactly the ones needed to solve these empirical problems  . The criteria I have in mind are tile following two general requirements for semantic representation  , imposed in Montague's\[20\] "Universal Grammar ": Condition ( 1 ) : Tile logical form language must be " dispensable "  . 
I haexean plea of VP ellipaln , the a . ntecedent i in bold , and the target , or reconstructed material , is bracketed . 
2A po~ible exception is the account of Prfist et a1  ( \[23\] ,  \[24\]) . 
Idi $ ctms problenm with this account in section 4.
ACRESDE COLING-92 , NANTES , 2328 Ao~'r1992303 PROC . OVCOLING-92, NANTES , AUO .  2328 , 199 2 Condition ( 2 ) : Semantic representations must have contextual parameters  . 
None of the existing semantic accounts satisfies both of these requirements  . As Partee and Bach\[21\] argue , the Sag/Williams account does not satisfy Condition  ( 1 )  , because it imposes an " alphabetic variance " condition  , making essential reference to the syntax of logical form expressions  . This condition is also imposed in Partee and Bach 's account  , and a similar condition arises in a very different setting in the account of Dalrymple  , Shieber and Pereira \[4\] . sOnly Lappin's account \[17\] explicitly removes the alphabetic variance condition  , bringing this account in accord with Condition ( 1 )  . However , semantic representations do not have contextual parameters in Lappin's account  , or in any of the other accounts . 
Thus , although there is a persistent intuition that VP ellipsis requires a semantic treatment  , no existing account is " properly semantic " in the sense required by conditions  ( 1 ) and ( 2 )  . In this paper I will describe such an account , in which the semantic representation of a VP is a three-tuple < DM ~  , P , DMo , t :> , consisting of a property P and input and output discourse models  . 
A key feature of this approach is that the antecedent is reconstructed at the ellipsis site as a semantic object which includes contextual dependencies  . These contextual dependencies can be resolved independently in the antecedent and the target  . This is required for example such as (1) and (2) . 
No reference to the syntax of logical form expressions is made in this approach  , satisfying Condition(1) . The representation fVP's as relations involving input and output discourse contexts satisfies Condition  ( 2 )  . So this account is more " properly semantic " than alternative semantic accounts  , whose theoretical status is somewhat less clear . One consequence of this theoretical clarity is the ease with which the approach can be computationally implemented  . 
I will describe an implementation of this approach in terms of some simple extensions to the Incremental Interpretation  System\[22\]  . The fact that this system incorporates contextual dependencies  , as required by Condition (2) , makes it very simple to implement he approach . Indeed in an important sense there are no additional mechanisms required for VP ellipsis  , over and above those independently required for pronominal and other forms of anaphora  . 
I begin with a brief overview of the Incremental Interpretation System  . I then describe my extensions to a The account of Klein  \[15\]  , while couched in the DI~F formal-hum , ? uentlally duplicates the Sag/Willian ~ approach  , defining verl in n ~ of the Derived VP rule and the Pronoun Rule in DITr terms  . Sells \[2ill also suggests storing properties in a DRT-style dlacour ~ model  , althoughe does not apply thlsto VP elll pais . 
this system which implement the type of approach to VP ellipsis I am advocating  , and I describe the derivation of an example that cannot be accommodated by alternative accounts  . Finally ,   1 point out that the current approach suggest some promising avenues for progress on the neglected question concerning the selection of an antecedent VP  . 
2 Background : The Incremental Interpretation System A semantic representatiou in the Incremental Interpretation  ( henceforth II ) System is called a " Conditional Interpretation " , which is defined as an assumption-sense pair , A : s , where A is a set of assumptions , and s is the sense . The sense can be thought of as the ordinary truth conditional semantic representation  . The assumption set consists of assumptions that have been introduced during the derivation  , and must be discharged before the derivation is complete  . The assumption set " represents constraints ou how the sense may be further connected to its context  . "  \[22\] The process of interpretation is defined by a set of structural rules and a set of discharge rules  . Structural rules build the conditional interpretation of a phrase compositionally  , from the conditional interpretation of its parts . Discharge rules remove assumptions . In principle all rules have an input and output discourse model  , but only the discharge rules actually interact with the discourse model  . 
The form of a structural rule is
P ~ A : s f f P1 ~ Al : sl and .   .   . and Pk~Ak:s : ? The ~ denotes the interpretation relation between a node of a syntactic analysis tree  ( produced by the parser ) and a node of a semantic derivation tree . P denotes a syntactic node , where its immediate constituents are denoted by variables  P1 through Pk . The rule schema is to be understood as stating a constraint that P receives the interpretation A : s if it has constituents PI through Pk  , and these constituents have the interpretations indicated  . 
The form of a discharge rule is
P ~ A':s'if P ~ A : s
Here , AI~-A-P ~ , where R is the discharged assumption . The discharge of R , together with the current state of the discourse model  , determines some modifications to s , resulting in s ~ . 
The assumption storage mechanism is based on Cooper storage  \[3\]  , which was applied to quantifier phenomena . In the II system , this mechanism is applied to several additional phenomena  . Below , I will ACT ~ DECOLING-92 , NANTES , 2328 AoLrr 1992304 PROC . OFCOLING-92, NANTES , AUG .  2328 ,   1992 describe the rules for pronominal anaphor and for quantifiers  . 
2 . 1 Ru les fo r P ronomina l Anaphora The treatment of pronominal anaphora in the It system is similar to the approach in Discourse Representation Theory  ( \[13\] ,  [12\] ) : indefinite NP's introduce new elements in the discourse model  . Pronouns and definite descriptions find their referent among elements in the discourse model  . 
Four types of referential NP's are defined : pronouns  , definite descriptions , indefinites , and names . They are represented as follows : bind(x , pronoun , number/gender ): x bind(x , def , sort ): x bind(x , indef , sort ): x bind(x , name , N ): xIn each case , the sense is represented by a parameter z , and a binding assumption expresses constraints on the way x will be replaced by an entity in the discourse model  . This is achieved by discharging the bind assumption  . The discharge rules are : A , bind(x , pronoun , number/gender ) : S = : , A : Six/el
A , bind(x , def , sort ): S = ~ A : Six/el
A , bind(x , in def , sort ): S = *- A : Six/el
A , bind(x , name , N ): S := ~ A : Six/el
In the ease of pronouns and definite descriptions , the element e must be a salient element in the input discourse model  , satisfying the constraints expressed in the binding assumption  . An indefinite assumption causes a new element e to be added to the output dis  . 
course model . In each case , e is substituted for each occurrence of x in the sense S  . At least for pronouns , there is a second possibility : instead of selecting e from the discourse model  , some other , und is charged parameter can be selected . This allows a pronoun to be bound by a quantifier  , as described below . 
2.2 Rules for Quantifiers
The treatment of qunntifiers in the II system essentially duplicates that of  Cooper\[3\]  . A quantified NP is represented by storing a quantifier assumption  , together with a parameter representing the sense . At some later stage in the derivation , the quantifier assumption is discharged , determining the scope of the quantifier . There are two general rules for quantifiers , governing the introduction and discharge of quantifier assumptions  . A quantified NP is represented as : bind(x , q , n ): x where x is a parameter , q is the quantifier , and n is the common noun . For example , " every jet " is represented bind(x , every , jet ): x Simplifying slightly , the discharge of quantifier assumptions cml be represented as follows : bind  ( x , q , s ) : P t =*"( qsx ) p
As an example , bind(x , every jet ) : fly ( x )  =~  ( every jet x ) fly ( x ) As mentioned above , when a pronoun assumption is discharged , its parameter is replaced either by an entity in the discourse model  , or by some , yet und is charged parameter . A pronoun becomes " bound " by a quantifier if the quantifier parameter replaces the pronoun parameter in this way  . 
3 The Account o f VP E l l ips is 1 now describe a semantic account of VP ellipsis in terms of some simple extensions to the II system  . The approach parallels the above approach to pronominal anaphora  . I will define a rule to add VP-meanings in the discourse model  , and a rule for recovering those VP-meanings to resolve a nelliptical VP  . Thus full VP's are analogous to indefinite NP's , in that they both typically introduce semantic objects into the discourse model  , and elliptical VP's are analogous to pronouns , in that their interpretation requires the selection of an appropriate object from the discourse model  . The discourse model will have two sets : SE , the set of salient entities , and SP , tile set of salient predicates . 
To add VP-meoafings to the discourse model , I allow all lexical verbs to introduce all assumption which adds the VP-meaning to the discourse model  . I call this binding assumption type " pred " . It is discharged as follows:
A , bind(pred ): S := ~ A : S where
DMou , ( SP ) = DMi . ( SP ) UA : S)
That is , tile discharge results in the semantic representation of the VP  ( i . e . , the ~ . ssumption-sense pair A : S ) being added to the SP set of the output discourse model  . 
l add the requirement that all arguments excep the subject must be filled hefore the assumption is discharged  . That is , the discharge of this a ~ sumption is permitted only if tile sense is of the form ACRESDE  COLING-92  , NANTES , 2328 AOI~T1992305 PROC . O1; COL1NG-92, NANTES , AUO .  2328, 1992
P ( SUB~I , at . . . . . an ) where SUBJ represents an unfilled subject argument position  , with the remaining arguments althrough a . 

The assumption for recovering a VP-meaning is introduced by a lexical auxiliary verb  ; this assumption is termed " epred ' , for elliptical predicate . 
The discharge rule is : bind ( epred ) : AUX::~A : S where A : S is some element of the SP set in DMIn  . 
That is , upon discharge of the epred assumption , an auxiliary verb is replaced by some VP-meaning in the input discourse model  . 
The crucial point in these rules is that the antecedent VP is represented as an assumption -sense pair  , since it is the assumptions that represent dependencies on context  . For example , the representation f the VP " help him " might be bind  ( x , pronoun , male ): help ( SUBJ , x) . 
This expresses the constrain that the object position must be filled by some entity in the discourse model according to constraints of pronominal reference  . Two copies of this VP , as antecedent and target in VP ellipsis , could allow the pronoun to refer to different entities  , depending on the state of the current discourse model  .

Later , the binding assumption for the pronoun is discharged  , allowing the pronoun to be bound to '% boy " . 
This example receives a straightforward derivation in the system I am proposing  . In other accounts , it appears that examples of this sort cannot be acconl-modated  . It is clear , for example , that the example violates the alphabetic variance condition imposed in the Sag/Williams approach  . This condition requires that the antecedent mid target VP's be identical up to renaming of bound variables  . In the example , the antecedent VP contains a free variable ( him / ) which becomes him . /in the target , violating the alphabetic variance condition . Partee and Bach\[21\] adopt essentially the same alphabetic variance condition  , as does Klein\[15\] , so that their accounts also rule out the example .   Lappin's\[17\] a cemmt explicitly rejects the alphabetic variance condition  , replacing it with the following condition : For any two occurrences c ~ and fl of an open VP intension ? xl  , tr can serve as the antecedent of / ~ iff both occurrences of xl can be naturally interpreted as having the same intended range of possible values  . 
The example clearly violates this condition : since him/ranges over members of Bill's class  , and him `/ picks out a member of John's class , they do not have " the same intended range of possible values "  . 
Next , I consider the higher order matching approach of Dalrymple  , Shieber and Pereira \[4\] ( DSP) . In this approach , a matching operation is performed to solve an equation  , in which a second order variable represents the elliptical VP  . To set up the equation , it is SThe quantifier " every boy in Bill's class " is represented in the derivation as " every boy  "  , for the sake of brevity . Similarly for " a boy in John's class " . 
necessary to determine the antecedent clanse and the " parallel elements "  , and DSP provide no method Ibrmaking this determination  . " l ~\] pieally , with VP ellipsis , there are two adjacent clauses , in which tile second clause contains an elliptical VP  . Then the first clause is the antecedent clause and the two subjects are the parallel elements  . Applying this to the current example , we have " Mary would a skhiual out " as the antecedent clause  , and " Mary " mad " she " as parallel elements . The equation to solve is
P(Mary ) = ask-out ( Mary , him /)
In this case , the desired solution,
Az . ask-out(x , himj ) is not a possible solution to this equation , according totile matching operation used by DSP . This is the most straightforward method of determining parallelism to set up the equation  , and it does not permit the derivation of the desired reading  , t lowever , it may be that all extended notion of parallelism ight solve the problem  . While this has not been investigated by DSP , such an approach as been advocated in another ecent account  , that proposed by Priisteta1(\[23\] , \[24\]) . It appears that this account can accommodate he example  , based on Priist et als requirement that if a pronoun p is bound to Q in the antecedent  , the corresponding pronoun p ' must be bound to a " structurally parallel " Q ~ in the target  , where this is intended as matching syntactic and semantic structure  . However , example ( 3 ) indicates that the two quantifiers need not be in structurally parallel positions  . Indeed , example ( 5 ) shows that there is no requirement for a corresponding quantifier at all  . 
(3 ) Almost every boyl in the class hope Mary will ask hlmiout  , but I know there are a few boys i who hope that she wo n't  . \[ ask him `/ out\](4) Everyboyi in Mrs . Smith's class hoped she would pass himl . In John's `/ case , 1 think she will . \[ passhim `/\] Examples ( 1 )  -  ( 4 ) illustrate the flexibility required in interpreting pronouns within the antecedent and target VP's  . I have shown how the proposed approach permits this flexibility  . None of the alternative accounts discussed can accommodate hese examples  . 
5 Constraints on Selecting an

I have argued that tile current approach as significant advantages over other approaches to problem  ( 2 )  , concerning tile level of representation at which VP ellipsis ACRESDE  COL\]NG-92  , NANT f . S , 2328 A Ol~r1992307 PROC . OFCOLING-92, NANTES , AUO . 2328,1992 is resolved . In addition , this approach suggest some poesible ways of v ~ldreasing problem  ( 1 )  , concerning the selection among alternative potential antecedents  . 
Since the approach parallels the treatment of pronominal anaphora  , storing semantic representations of both VP's and NP's in the discourse model  , a natural hypothesis is that similar constraints govern the selection of an antecedent in both the pronominal and the VP ellipsis cases  . 
The problem of selecting among alternative VP antecedents has been virtually ignored in the literature  .   6 The corresponding problem in pronominal anaphora has received a significant amount of attention  . The Centering model (\[6\] , \[7\] , \[1\] ) of pronominal anaphora is a leading example , applying a variety of constraints dealing with such factors as recency  , salience , and attention . In addition , it is generally agreed that there are syntactic on figurational constraints governing pronominal anaphora of the sort described in the " Binding Theory " of  GB\[2\]  . 
For each of these types of constraints , there are interesting parallels with the case of VP ellipsis  . 
Syntact lc/configuratlonah It appears that VP ellipsiso beys the " precede and command " constraint  , as pointed out by Jackendo ~8\] , ruling out examples such 8 . 8 (5) * Charlie will , if his mother-in-law doesn't leave town . 
Recency : Just as in the pronominal case , the vast majority of cases involves an antecedent in the current or immediately preceding utterance  . In a survey of VP ellipsis in the Brown Corpus\[10\]  , I found this to be true about 95% of the time . 
Salience : VP's in less salient position seem to be less available as antecedents for VP ellipsis  . For exam-pie , Halliday and Hasan\[9\] give the following example : ( 6 ) A : The police man paid no attention to the girl who was driving the car  . 
(7)* B : Wass here all y ?
Presumably the unavailability of the VP"driving the car " is related to the fact that it appears in a restrictive relative clause and is thus not particularly salient  . 
Attentionah There is evidence that a " center shift "  , i . e . , shifting attention from one entity to another , might be correlated with the availability of VP antecedents  . This is suggested by experimental work of Malt\[19\]  , who describes experiments hat show , inherterms , that " changing the focus " in an intervening eA note by Klein ~ d Stmlnt on-EUi J  \[16l   , points out the importance of problem ( l ) , sentence tends to make a previous VP antecedent inaccessible  . Thus the first example ( taken from Malt's experiment ) was understood more readily than the second : ( 8 ) a . "Iliked the Monet exhibit , " Heather remarked . 
b . " It was really very nice ".
c."I did too , " Richard replied.
(9) a . "Iliked the Monet exhibit , " Heather remarked . 
b . "Renoirismy favorite , though . " c . * " I did too , " Richard replied . 
There is reason to believe , then , that constraints relating to factors such as recency  , syntactic on figura-tion , salience , and attention , might apply to VP ellipsis and pronominal nnaphora in a similar way  . A simplified version of these constraints i implemented in the pronoun case of the Incremental Interpretation System  , and it would a simple matter to allow the same constraints to apply to VP antecedents  . 
6 Conclusions
While it has been argued by many that VP ellipsis is a semantic phenomenon  , there is no existing account that satisfie some standard requirements on semantic representation  , relating to the " dispensability " of the meaning -representation language  , and the incorporation of contextual dependencies in semantic representations  . In addition , existing semantic accounts have important empirical problems  , not allowing pronouns to switch reference from antecedent to target with sufficient flexibility  . The modifications necessary to comply with the standard requirements on semantic representation are exactly the ones needed to solve these empirical problems  . I have described such a semantic account , showing that it handles the examples that are ruled out by alternative semantic accounts  . 
The approach is easily implemented eomputationally  , by some simple extensions to the Incremental Interpretation System  . In addition , there is evidence indicating that the selection of a VP antecedent might be subject to the same sort of constraints that govern pronominal anaphora  .
