We present a novel automatic approach to constructing a bilingual semantic network ? the BiFrameNet  , to enhance statistical and transfer-based machine translation systems  . 
BiFrameNet is a frame semantic representation , and contains semantic structure transfers between English and Chinese  . The English FrameNet and the Chinese HowNet provide us with two different views of the semantic distribution of lexicon by linguists  . We propose to induce the mapping between the English lexical entries in FrameNet to Chinese word senses in HowNet  , furnishing a bilingual semantic lexicon which simulates the ? concept lexicon ? supposedly used by human translators  , and which can thus be beneficial to machine translation systems  . BiFrameNet alo contains bilingual example sentences that have the same semantic roles  . We automatically induce Chinese example sentences and their semantic roles  , based on semantic structure alignment from the first stage of our work  , as well as shallow syntactic structure . In addition to its utility for machine-aided and machine translations  , our work is also related to the spatial models proposed by cognitive scientists in the framework of artifactual simulations of the translation process  . 
1. Introduction
The merits of translation at the word level or the concept level have long been a cause for debate among linguists  . Some linguists suggest that the two languages of a bilingual speaker share a common semantic system  ( Illes and Francis 1999 ; Ikeda 1998 ) and hence translation is carried out at the concept level  . 
Meanwhile , there has been a gradual convergence of statistical and transfer approaches in machine translation recently  ( Wu 2003 )  . Statistical MT systems are based on a stochastic mapping between lexical items  , assuming the underlying semantic transfer is hidden  . Transfer systems use explicit lexical , syntactic and semantic transfer rules . 
Consequently , cognitive scientists and computational linguists a like have been interested in the study of semantic mapping between languages  ( Ploux and Ji ,  2003 , Dorr et al ,  2002 , Ngai et al ,  2002 , Boas 2002 , Palmer and Wu ,  1995) . We propose to automatically construct a bilingual lexical semantic network with word sense and semantic role mapping between English and Chinese  , simulating the ? concept lexicon ? , suggested by cognitive scientists , of a bilingual person . 

Figure 1 . BiFrameNet lexicon and example sentence induction The linguists-defined ontologies ?- FrameNet  ( Baker et al ,  1998) , HowNet ( Dong and Dong ,  2000) , and bilingual dictionaries are the basis for the induction of the mapping  . We automatically estimate the semantic transfer likelihoods between English FrameNet lexical entries and the Chinese word senses in HowNet  , and align those frames and lexical pairs with highlikelihood values  . In addition , we propose to induce Chinese example sentences automatically to match English annotated sentences provided in the FrameNet  . The BiFrameNet thus induced provides an additional resource for machine-aided or machine translation systems  . It can also serve as a reference to be compared to cognitive studies of the translation process  .

I Figure 2 . BiFrameNet ontology induction Ploux and Ji ,   ( 2003 ) proposed a spatial model for matching semantic values between French and English  . Palmer and Wu ( 1995 ) studied the mapping of change-of-state English verbs to Chinese  . Dorr et al .   ( 2002 ) described a technique for the construction of a ChineseEnglish verb lexicon based on HowNet and the English LCS Verb Database  ( LVD )  . They created links between HowNet concepts and LVD verb classes using both statistics and a manually constructed ? seed mapping ? of thematic classes between HowNet and LVD  . Ngai et al ( 2002 ) employed a word-vector based approach to create the alignment between WordNet and HowNet classes without any manual annotation  . Boas ( 2002 ) outlined a number of issues surrounding the planning and design of German FrameNet  ( GFN )  , a bilingual FrameNet dictionary which , when complete , will have a corpus-based German lexicon following the 
FrameNet structure.
2.1. FrameNet and HowNet
The Berkeley FrameNet database consists of frame -semantic descriptions of more than  7000 English lexical items , together with example sentences annotated with semantic roles  ( Baker et al ,  1998) . There is currently no frame semantic representation of Chinese  . However , the Chinese HowNet ( Dong and Dong 2000 ) represents a hierarchical view of lexical semantics in Chinese  . 
This paper is organized as follows : Section 2 describes the algorithm for estimating transfer relations between FrameNet and HowNet structures  . 
Section 3 presents our method for selecting BiFrameNet example sentences for a particular frame and automatically inducing semantic role annotations  . We conclude in Section 4 , followed by a discussion in Section 5 . 
FrameNet is a collection of lexical entries grouped by frame semantics  . Each lexical entry represents an individual word sense  , and is associated with semantic roles and some annotated sentences  . 
Lexical entries with the same semantic roles are grouped into a ? frame ? and the semantic roles are called ? frame elements ?  . For example:
Frame : Cause_harm
Frame Elements : agent , body_part , cause , event , instrument , iterations , purpose , reason , result , victim ? . .
Lexical Entries : bash . v , batter . v , bayon et . v , beat . v , belt . v , bludge on . v , boil . v , break . v , bruise . v , buffet . v , burn . v,? . 
Example annotated sentence of lexical entry ? beat . v ? : [ agent I ] lay downonhim and beat [ victim at him ] [ means with my fists]  . 
2 . Lexical semantic mapping in Bi FrameNet Dorret al  ( 2002 ) uses a manual seed mapping of semantic roles between FrameNet and LVD to induce a bilingual verb lexicon  . In this paper , we propose a method of automatically mapping the English FrameNet lexical entries to HowNet concepts  , resulting in the BiFrameNet ontology . We also make use of two bilingual EnglishChinese lexicons for this induction  . In this section 2 , we use an example FrameNet lexical entry ? beat . v ? in the ? cause_harm ? frame to illustrate the main steps of our algorithm  . 
HowNet is a Chinese ontology with a graph structure of word senses called ? concepts ?  , and each concept contains 7 fields including lexical entries in Chinese , English gloss , POS tags for the word in Chinese and English , and a definition of the concept including its category and semantic relations  ( Dong and Dong ,  2000) . For example , one translation for ? beat . v ? is ?: In this work , we make use of contextual lexical entries from the same semantic frame  , as illustrated above . In this example , the ? cause_harm ? frame contains two lexical entries ? ? beat  . v ? and ? strike . v? . 
From the previous step , ? beat . v ? and ? strike . v ? is each linked to a number of Chinese candidates  . 
?beat . v ? is linked to ? ? ? with membership in two different HowNet categories  , namely ? ? beat ? and ??? associate ? . To disambiguate between the above these 2 candidate categories , we make use of the other lexical entries in ? cause_harm ?  , in this case ? strike . v ? which is linked to ??? , in the ? ? beat ? HowNet category . Now , ? beat ? receives two votes ( from ?? and from ?? )  , and ? associate ? only one ( from ??) . We therefore choose the HowNet category ? beat ? to be aligned to the frame ? cause_harm ?  , and eliminate the sense of ??? in the ??? associate ? category  . Consequently , ? beat . v ? in ? cause_harm ? is linked to all HowNet concepts that are translations of ? beat ? which are verbs  , and which also belong to the HowNet category ? beat ?  ( but not ? associate ? )  .

Whereas HowNet concepts correspond roughly to FrameNet lexical entries  , its semantic relations do not correspond directly to FrameNet semantic roles  . 
2 . 2 . Initial mapping based on bilingual lexicon ( step 1 ) We use the bilingual lexicon from HowNet and LDC dictionary to first create all possible mappings between FrameNet lexical entries and HowNet concepts whose part-of-speech  ( POS ) tags are the same . Here we assume that syntactic classification for the majority of FrameNet lexical entries  ( i . e . 
verbs and adjectives ) are semantically motivated and are mostly preserved across different languages  . For example ? beat ? can be translated into ? ,  ? ,  ?? ,  ?? ,  ?? ,  ?? ,  ? , ??? in HowNet and ? ,  ?? ,  ? ,  ?? , ? ? in the LDC EnglishChinese dictionary . ? beat . v ? is then linked to all HowNet concepts whose Chinese word/phrase is one of the translations and the part of speech is verb ? v ?  . 

In our example , HowNet concepts under two HowNet categories ?? beat ? and ? damage ? are linked to the ? cause_harm ? frame in FrameNet  . Only the concepts in the top N categories are considered as correctly linked to the lexical entries in the ? cause_harm ? frame  . We heuristically chose N to be three in our algorithm  . 
2 . 4 . Final mapping adjusted by taxonomy distance ( step 3 ) Using frame context alone in the above step can effectively prune out incorrect links  , but it also prunes some correct links whose HowNet categories are not in the top three categories  . In this next step , we aim to recover this kind of pruned links by finding other categories with high similarity to the chosen categories  . We introduce the category similarity score ( Liu and Li ,  2002) , which is based on the
HowNet taxonomy distance : 2 . 3 . Refined mapping based on semantic contexts in both languages  ( step 2 ) At this stage , each FrameNet lexical entry has links to multiple HowNet concepts and categories  . For example , ? beat . v ? in ? cause_harm ? frame is linked to ??? in both the ? beat ? category and the ? associate ? category  ( as in ????/ make a phone call ? )  . We need to choose the correct HowNet concept ( word sense )  . 
Many word sense disambiguation algorithms use contextual words in a sentence as disambiguating features  . 
Sim(category1, category2) = + d ? ?
Where d is the path length from category1 to category2 in the taxonomy . ? is an adjusting parameter , which controls the curvature of the similarity score  . We set ? = 1 . 6 in our work following the experiment results in Liu and Li  ( 2002 )  . If the similarity of category p and one of the top three categories is higher than a threshold t  , the category p is also considered as a valid category for the frame  . 

In our example , some valid categories , such as ? firing ??? is not selected in the previous step even though it is related to the ? cause_harm ? frame  . Based on the HowNet taxonomy , the similarity score between ? firing ? and ? beat  ? is  1  . 0, which is above the threshold set . Hence , ? firing ? is also chosen as a valid category and the concepts in this category are linked to the ? beat  . v ? lexical entry in the ? cause_harm ? frame . However , using taxonomy distance can cause errors such as ? in the ? weave ? category to be aligned to ? beat  . v ? in the ? cause_harm ? frame . 
2.5. BiFrameNet lexicon evaluation
We evaluate our work by comparing the results to a manually set golden standard of transfer links for some lexical entries in FrameNet  , and use the precision and recall rate as evaluation criteria  . 
Manual evaluation of all lexical entries is a slow process and is currently still ongoing  . However , to show the lower bound of the system performance  , we chose FrameNet lexical entries with the highest number of transfer links to HowNet concepts as the test set  . Since each link is a word sense , these lexical entries have most ambiguous translations  . Since the number of lexical entries in a FrameNet parent frame  ( i . e . frame size ) is an important factor in the disambiguation step  , we analyze our results by distinguishing between ? small frames ?  ( a frame with less than 5 lexical entries ) and ? large frames ? . 
24% of the frames are ? small frames ? . Referring to Tables 2 and 3 , we can see a weighted average of (0 . 649*0 . 24+0 . 874*0 . 76) = 82% Fmeasure .

3 . Crosslingual induction of example annotated sentences in BiFrameNet In the second stage of our proposed work  , we aim to automatically induce Chinese example sentences that are appropriate for each semantic frame  . 
Together with English example sentences that already exist in the English FrameNet  , they form part of the BiFrameNet , and serve to provide concrete examples of bilingual usage of semantic roles  . They can be used either as a resource for machine -aided translation or training data for machine translation  . 

FrameNet is a collection of over 100-million words of samples of written and spoken language from a wide range of sources  , including British and American English . All the example sentences are chosen by linguists for their representativeness of particular semantic roles  , grammatical functions , and phrase type . The current FrameNet contains on average 30 annotated example sentences per predicate , which is still inadequate for automatic semantic parsing systems  ( Fleischman et al ,  2003) . 
Each FrameNet example sentence contains a predicate  . The semantic roles of the related frame elements are manually labeled  . The syntactic phrase type ( e . g . NP , PP ) and their grammatical function ( e . g . external argument , object argument ) are also labeled . An example annotated sentence containing the predicate ? beat  . v ?, in the ? cause_harm ? frame , is shown below :
Example sentence type : trans-simple
We are fighting a barbarian , and [ agent : we]must [ predicate : beat ] [ victim : him ]  . 

In order to provide a representative set of Chinese example sentences automatically for a particular frame  , our method must fulfill the following criteria : 1  ) It must find real sentences occurring naturally in 
Chinese texts ;  2 ) It should find sentences that cover as many different usage and domain as possible  ;  3 ) It must find sentences that have the same semantic roles as the English example sentences  ;

Figure 3 . BiFrameNet example sentence induction 4 ) It should require no manual annotation of any kind  . 

There are at least three different ( semi- ) automatic approaches for mining Chinese example sentences : i  ) Translate all English example sentences into Chinese by automatic means  , and annotate the semantic roles by word alignment  ; This approach is not appropriate because machine translation can be erroneous and this method does not satisfy criteria  ( 1 ) and ( 2 )  . 
ii ) Construct an English semantic parser and a Chinese parser independently  , and use them to annotate the sentences in a sentence aligned  , parallel corpus ; Apart from the high cost of building two semantic parsers  , which itself requires semantically annotated Chinese data  ; it would be necessary to create artificial links between independent human annotations manually  . 
iii ) Mine Chinese sentences from a monolingual corpus that are syntactically similar to the English example sentence  , and induce semantic roles from the syntactic transfer function between English and 


This is the approach we take . Inspired by previous work on syntax-driven semantic parsing  ( Gildea and Jurafsky , 2002; Fleischman et al ,  2003) , and syntaxbased machine translation ( Wu , 1997; Cuerzan and Yarowsky ,  2002) , we postulate that syntactically similar sentences with the same predicate also share similar semantic roles  . In this paper , we present our first experiments on inducing semantic roles based on shallow syntactic information  . We mine Chinese example sentences from naturally occurring monolingual corpus  , and rank them by their syntactic similarity to our English example sentences  . A dynamic programming algorithm then annotates the aligned syntactic units with the same semantic roles  . The example Chinese sentences are not translations of the English sentences  . Therefore , the set of example sentences within a frame is enriched  , providing better coverage for MT and CLIR systems . 
3 . 1 . Induction from aligned predicate bilingual lexical pair Since frames are disjoint  , we propose a method for finding example sentences one frame at a time  . 
In this paper , we focus on finding Chinese example sentences for the largest frame ? cause_harm ? and the main semantic roles in this frame ?? agent ?  , ? predicate ? and ? victim ? 1 . 

For each English lexical entry and its target translation candidates in the BiFrameNet  , we first extract sentences that contain the translation candidates from a large Chinese monolingual corpus  . Figure 4 shows some initial Chinese example sentence candidates under ? beat  . v ? . There are many sentences that do not have the ? agent-predicate-victim ? structure  . Our next step is to find the Chinese sentences that have the ? agent ?  , ? predicate ? and ? victim ? semantic roles and annotate them automatically  . 
?????????????????  ( the souther narmy killed and maimed hundreds of government soldiers  )  ??????????????  ( soldier sharmed innocent civilians during the attack  )  ??????????????  ( farmers cut down more than 70 trees )  ???????  ( use the needle to prick the squash )  *?????????? ( the media exposed/produced an investigation report  )  *????????????????  ( some publishers adopt a ? idiom ? method ) Figure 4 . Some Chinese example sentence and glosses 3 . 2 . Inducing semantic roles from crosslingual
POS transfer
Among all the Chinese sentences containing the target predicate words  , we need to identify those that contain the same semantic roles as those of the English example sentences in FrameNet  . Current automatic semantic parsing algorithms ( Gildea and Jurafsky 2003 , Fleischman et al ,  2003 ) are all based on syntactic parse trees showing a close coupling of semantic and syntactic structures  . 
Without carrying out full syntactic parsing of the Chinese sentences  , we postulate that the semantic 1As an example , for ? beat . v ? ,   73% of the English example sentences have these three semantic roles  , only 27% also have other semantic roles such as ? tools ? . 
roles of a sentence are generated by the underlying shallow syntactic structure of the sentence such as POS tag sequences  . We therefore focus on finding bilingual sentence pairs that are comparable in POS structure  , though not necessarily having any lexical comparability  . Note that this constitutes only a subset of all possible Chinese example sentences for each frame  . The expansion of this set remains the objective of our future research

Table 5. Example POS tag transfer
Given an English example sentence , its semantic role sequence , and its POS tag sequence ; and a set of Chinese sentences and their POS tag sequence  , we use a dynamic programming method ( Figure 5 ) to find the Chinese sentence whose POS sequence is most likely to be generated from the English POS sequence  , and the alignment path . The Chinese word aligned to the English word will assume the latter?s semantic role  .

We estimate the syntactic POS transfer probabilities from the HKNews Corpus  .

The highest ranking Chinese sentences are used for the BiFrameNet  .

Conclusion We have presented a first quantitative and automatic approach of constructing a bilingual lexical semantic resource ? the BiFrameNet  . 
BiFrameNet consists of mappings between
FrameNet semantic frames and HowNet concepts , as well as English and Chinese example sentences for a particular frame  , with annotated semantic roles in the English FrameNet labels  . Evaluation results show that we achieve a promising  82% average Fmeasure on lexical entry alignment , for the most ambiguous lexical entries ; and a 68-72% accuracy in Chinese example sentence induction , for the largest frame . The initial results are available at http://www . cs . ust . hk/~hltc/BiFrameNet and will be updated as further improvements and evaluations are implemented  . 
5. Discussion
There are a number of possible directions for future work  . One obvious extension is to use syntactic parse tree representations instead of POS sequences in example sentence alignment  . Second , there are many other Chinese sentences that share the same semantic roles  , but not the same POS sequences , which are not included . Using additional features to correctly identify these sentences and the constituent semantic roles is a topic of our ongoing research  . Moreover , we note that Chinese is a highly idiomatic and metaphoric language  . Compounded by the ambiguity of word boundaries , many predicate usages in Chinese are highly unexpected  . It is worth considering using other Chinese linguistic resources to enhance the example sentence extraction and annotation  . Finally , BiFrameNet needs to be further evaluated and manual postprocessing is perhaps required  . 
We expect the final complete BiFrameNet , in addition to the various FrameNet and PropBank resources being developed manually  , will be a valuable resource for statistical and interlingua transfer-based MT systems  , as well as to human translators in an machine -aided translation scenario  . 
We are also motivated to investigate the relationship between our results and those of semantic mapping models proposed by cognitive scientists  .
