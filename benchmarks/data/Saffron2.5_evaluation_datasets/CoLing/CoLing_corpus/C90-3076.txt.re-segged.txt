An experimental system for dialogue structure analysis based on a new type plan recognition model for spoken dialogues has been implemented  . This model is realized by using four typed plans which are categorized into three kinds of universal pragmatics and aldnd of task-dependent knowledge related to common action hierarch i es  . The experimental system is characterized by higher modularity and computational efficiency through defining a hierarchical usage order between these knowledges  . The system can grasp a dialogue structure making it possible to solve problems related to spoken dialogue interpretation  . 
1. INTRODUCTION
An efficient , and smooth communication be ' ~ ween humans is generally realized in spoken dialogues  . This fact is mainly supported by various ell ips is exp : ? essions concerning old information  , the dialogue participants , zero-pronouns - especially in dapanese , substitutional verbs and so on . Ass result , each utterance is fragmental . A sequence of these utterances generally construct a whole dialogue step by step  . \[' ragmental utterance comprehension by a hearer can be achieved using knowledge of the dialogue sitamtion  , context intbrmation , domain dependent knowledge , especially the donm independent action hie rarchy\[Li  tman871  , universal pragmatics concerning how to advance a dialogue  , maintain dialogue cooperation between dia logue participants  , etc . , and language specific pragmatics \ [ Levinson 831 . Suchellii ; sis-resolution - is one of the main problems in discourse understanding  . Several approaches were proposed and implemented in\[  fiendrix781  , \[Shimazu79\] , \ [ Carbonel 1831 , etc . These researchers used various heuristic rules and did not make a clear distinction between domain ~ pecific knowledge and pragmatics  . As a consequence , the user interface became inflexible because the system basically handled expected utterance patterns  . 
* ( 1 ) : A discourse goal is characterized by a discourse expectation which dialogue participants mutually believe as an expectation  . Therefore , a discourse goal is very vague because a expectation depends on various attentions or empathies and the participant's knowledge  , *(2): Allowing embedded turn-takings . 
* ( 3 ) : A communicative act is basically defined as an abstract action  , one that effects the bearer's thinking ordec i , qiommaking and which can be described by a plan schema  ( cf . Cohen 84) . 
Recently , a plan-based dialogue understanding approach was developed using a kind of pragmatics metaplan : a ' discourse plan ' incorporated with domain knowledge  , ' domain plan'\[Litnmn 871 . This approach was based on Allen & Perrault's plan recognition strategies \[  AllenS0\]  , \[ Perrault S0\] , [ Allen 871 . By way of contrast , a pragmatic-based approach was proposed in order to understand intersentential elliptical fragments\[  Carberry891  . She claimed Litnmn's strategies could not recognize a surprise or s doubt conveyed by an elliptical fragment  , for example "$10 , 000 ":" ,  . which is not a complete sentence including postulated speech acts ' request ' or ' inform '  . In addition , she also claimed that metaplans representing communicative goals should be dealt with adequately  . She newly introduced ' discourse expectation ' rules for grasping interaction between an info rmation-seeker and an information-provider and ' discourse goal ' rules for identifying an in formation-seeker's conversational or communicative goa\[*  ( l )  . 
These rules are heuristics for interpreting an elliptical fragment which explicitly indicates no linguistic clues to interpreting speech act  . s . On the other hand , in order to make the general understanding mechanism clear  , a surprise or a doubt fragment such as mentioned above  , must be understood from recognizing an irregular meaning from the view of gaps between common sense  ( a certain prerequisite on dition ) and the declaration . Furthermore , studying how to express a query , an answer , a confirmation , a surprise or a doubt in a context and a dialogue situation is necessary  . 
In consideration of making a dialogue unders tanding model including such an understanding process  , a method to handle pragmaties and utterance or dialogue must be studied  . This l?aj ) er shows three typed pragmaties use ( t1 or cooperative dialogue development , as well as a dialogue structure analysis and understand infi model using a plan recognition approach  . ' lhepragmatlcs are described by a ' dialogue plan '  , ' communication plan ' and ' interaction plan ' . 
2. THREETYPED PRAGMATICS
Three types of universal pragmaties ( el.
LevinsonS3 ) can be classified and described by the following plans : Interaction-Plan-a plan basically ehara eterized by a dialogue turn-taking *  ( 2 ) which describes a sequence of communicative acts *  ( 3 )  , Communication-Plan-a plan which determines how to execute or Dialogued : qan : a plan for establ is hing a dialogue construction  , e . g . a cooperative dialogue * (4) . 
For example , in order to achieve the goal of registering for the conference tim following sequer  , ce must usually be performed ( Domain-Plan : obtain a registration form , fill out the form and return it to the secretariat  . In such a telephone dialo'ue , if something is needed to execute the gore action  , are questo send it can be made , or it will be offered to you ( Co:mmunication-t ) lan )  . To complete the cooperative infbrnmtion-seeking , the hearer will resl ) on d to the speaker's request * ( 5 )   ( Interaction-Plan )  . Beior c building a whole dialogue structure , the speaker should utter the opening section of the dialogue  , especially on the telephone . Furthermore when the dialogue is finished , the speaker should wide up the dialogue ( Dialogue-Plan )  . 
Each plan is described in terms of a schema formulation  ( plan-schema )  . 
A plan-schema has various lots to describe both an action's inner properties  , e . g . HEADER and 41 r ~ , l ? ? PILI ) ICAIE&CASES , and relations ttlps between the action and prerequisite states/actions  , effects , etc . , e . g . PREREQUISITE,
DECOMPOSITIONS , CONSTRAINTS,

A definite hierarchical order among these plans is available as follows  ; Interaction-Plan > Communication-Plan >
Domain-Plan > Dialogue-Plan.
3. DIAL OGUE ANALY SIS
There are several linguistic phenomena which are hard to interpret  , such as ellipses , referring pronouns and substitutional expressions  . Both information from the established context and expectations from the current dialogue situation are required to resolve such problems  . In order to get these information a dialogue structure which indicates the goal hierarchy of utterances in a dialogue must be constructed  . A dialogue analysis is required and it is necessary to determine  ;   ( 1 ) how to infer each goal of an utterance within a dialogue  ,   ( 2 ) how to make clear the relationships between goals within the dialogue  . 
For the first problem , a plan recognition inference method is adequate for identifying an utterance intention because the intention can be inferred by recognizing the speaker's plan by chaining communicative acts regarded as speech acts in a specific domain \[  Allen80  )  , \ [ Perrault80\] , \[Litman87\] . For the second problem , the * ( 4 ) : A dialogue global construction usually has an opening section and closing section  . Ilere , such a linguistic phenotm nonis regarded as language-universal  . 
*(5): On the other hand , in order to complete the cooperative interaction , when the speaker imparts information , the hearer will confirm what the speaker has said according to the speaker's belief in the hearer's intention  . 
* ( 6 ) An active chart parser has been developed for Japanese dialogue analysis on a unification based grammar  , which is based on IIPSG and JPSG\[Pollard 88) , \[Gunji87\] , \[ Kogure 89\] . Furthermore , many discourse entities can be identified by using NPI dentification Method\[  Nogaito88\]  . 
domain . .specific , knowledge is related to the action and objects , especially the action hierarchy which is used to grasp the utterance ~ oal  , and three kinds of pragmatics between unmns involved in a spoken dialogue are used to grasp the dialogue development  . 
3 A Communicative Acts
First , in order to recognize the speaker's plan , it is necessary to recognize the turntaking patterns  . Communicative acts\[Cohen84\] are introduced . In Fig . l , an example of communicative acts in a cooperative task-oriente dialogue  , e . g . ' queries and explanations regarding registration for an international conference ' is shown  . 
A communicative act in the demand class and a corresponding act in the response class make a turntaking pair  . This is recognized by the interaction plan . A communicative act is a decomposition element of an interaction plan  .

Eig . 1At ) Example oi ' Commurticative Acts 3 . 2 Inference Mechanism ' An utterance meaning is represented by illocutionary speech act types and propositional contents obtained from at lead-Dr iven unification-based active chart parser *  ( 6 ) for Japanese dialogues . The parsing result is described by a feature structure and tim system input is modified into a communicative act with propositional contents  . These consist of a certain predicate , an ' utterance type ' , and some variables , in particular , ' speaker ' , hearer ' , and ' topic ' . ' Topic ' is , on a surface level , an NP marked with the Japanese special particle , ' wa ' , or the compound particle ' nituite ' . 
The plan recognizer (1) assumes a goal . (2) If a particular goal cannot be found , then stopelse go to next (3) .   ( 3 ) Infer a chaining path from an input to the goal . If success , stop . Else return to the first process ( 1 ) in order to try to find the next candidate . The chaining process between plans generally finds a candidate plan from the current state  ( IIEA DER ) to an action list represented in I ) ECOMPOSIT tON . I lowever if this fails , the chaining will be continued in accordance with PREREQUISITE and EFFECT  . 
In order to manage the current understanding state  , the system uses two slacks . 
UN1 ) ERSTANDING-IAST stores completed plans as the current understanding state  , and GOAL-IAST maintains in complete plans regarded as possibilities and expectations for  -2-   371 future goals . An overview of a dialogue structure construction process is shown in Fig  . 2 . 
4. ANEX PERIMENT ALSYSTEM
This analysis model is realized by using lout " typed plans which are categorized into Ulree types of universal pragmatics and a type o ? task -dependent knowledge related to common action hierarchies  . The system has been implemented in Symbolics Common Lisp  . A dialogue structure is represented by both completed plans and incomplete plans stored in the two stacks  . 
Therefore , the system can understandialogue meanings and can offer a dialogue structure using the contents of both stacks  . Four model dialogues regarding an international conference registration taken from slightly modified inter-keyboard dialogues in Japanese have been applied  . For example , the system can understand a Japanese substitutional expression  , e . g . " O-i sog-iku dasai " ( literal translation : ' Hurry please ' ) which shows no agent , no object and no verb , because the current topic which is focused on an action in the domain plan is known in the system and the omitted verb  ( e . g . ' Return-Form ' ) can be identified under the scope dominated by the topic  . 
5. CONCLUSION
Litman & Allen introduced a set of discourse plans  , each one corresponding to a particular way that an utterance can relate to a discourse topic  . They distinguish discourse plans from a set of domain plans  . The dialogue structure analysis model basically follows the above idea and uses new three typed pragmatics : interaction plan  , communication plan and dialogue plan . By introducing these plans , the mech~mism for constructing a dialogue structure becomes-clear because of the way a surface utterance is connected with both pragmatics and the domain-specific knowledge  , and by reducing the search space using a hierarchical order of applying knowledge  , computational efficiency is improved .
