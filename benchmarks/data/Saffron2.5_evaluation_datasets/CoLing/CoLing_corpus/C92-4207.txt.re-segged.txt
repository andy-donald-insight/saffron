beeattse of the I ) artiality of the information and tim vagueness about the sttatial rehttions alnollg tile entities  . So . at first , we extract such information as the qualitative spatial constraints among the spatial attributes of the entities  , and then . 
interprethese COll straillt Salld calcuhtte thet > a : ranleter values  . This process is shown in figure 1 . 
Given ~ text , SPRINT makes as m ' faeeease structure using the lexical information  . Each en-tity is described ms an oltlt . Next , SPRINT extracts spatial constraints about the entities by analyzing the related words in the case  . structure . At this time . SPRINT also extracts the sequence of the information references fl ' om the lexical mt brmation as dependencies  , which are used as cues in the calculation of the paranw-ters  . 
At the next stage , the extracted qualitative constraints are intertn'eted as then mnerical constraints among thee  , ltity paranlet c . rs . The senu-lllerical COll straillt S :4re repl'esented kS the COlllbi-natiolt of the primitive constraints  . Tit ( ! tm ten-tial energy function is one of such primitives  , and this is an efficient method to treat the vagllelte SS in the constraints  . Other primitives are the totm-logical constraints and the regions  . The potential energy flmction is a kind of the costfll netiolls which t~tkes all related paranmters and output the  ( ' ( ) st . The less the wthm of the potential ( m-ergyflmction , the more credit the combinatiml of the gemnetric parameters gains  . Using the gradient descendent method , the solution with n lininn n cost is calculated . The t ) otcntial(m-c . rgyflmction 1 ) rovides a means for accmnulating fl'om fragnmntal'y in for nuttion  .
