RESULTSOBTAINED WITH ANEW METHOD
FOR . THE AUTOMATICAN ALY SISOF
SENTENCESTR . UCTUR . ES
We present in this paper a method for the automatic analysis of 
sentence structures.
Our purpose is to constitute a frequency dictionary of the different structures used in the language  . This dictionary will enable us to select the most useful sentence structures in order to recommend their exclusive use for the writing of texts intended for automatic translation  . 
We think that the automatic translation will be possible only if the texts are submitted to rules which limit the complexity of their syntax  . These limitations will betheless noticed by an author as only the most unusual structures would have been left out  . Of course the number of permitted structures will increase as the automatic translation codes are improved  . 
The sentence structures are obtained by a statistical analysis of the word strings according to procedures developed in the information theory  . 
In the present paper we have analysed only groups of two consecutive words as an example of our method  . 
The same type of analysis can be generalized by considering nonconsecutive words and groups of more than two words  . 
1. GROUPS
The first step of the analysis is to put the words into groups according to their grammatical properties  , for example : noun , adjective , article and so on . The number of groups has been limited to keep significative frequencies with respect othe length of the corpus  ( 3500 words )  . In the text under study , we have used 67 groups . A list of these groups is given in Table 3 . 
216 ANDP , ~ ETRBTIAKOFF
Of course , our classification is somewhat arbitrary as it is based on a preliminary knowledge of the language  . We will show later how the results of the analysis can help us to detect inadequate classifications  . 
Each word of the corpus has been replaced by a symbol  ( two figures integer ) representing its grammatical group . We consider the words inside the sentence , that is to say between two strong punctuation signs  (  .  ; ! ?) . Inside the sentence all punctuation signs are suppressed  . 
We will call now " words " these symbols.
2. DICTIONARY OF STRINGS
The second step is the constitution of a string dictionary  . 
A sentence containing N words produces ( N--1 ) strings . For instance , the sentence Her daughter gave mean Italian less on everyday represented by the string "  55   04   01   44   45   05   04   85   04  " , produces the following strings : 15655 HER~2 . 1731~1574 DAUGHTEI ~ ~0 . 0242 ~ o + ~, 1581 GAVE .  ~* ~ 1 . 2671~+~15944 ME~+-0 . 7024~+16045 AN~*,2 . 3791+~+*1615 ITALIAN+~?+1 . 8602~+~~'1624 LESSON ~*++~-0 . 4213~++16385 EVERY+*+2 . 1941~**++1644 DAY , ** First ( complete ) string 550 4014 4450 5048504
Second string 0401444505048504 etc . . .   01   44   45   05   04   85   04   44   45   05   04   85   04  "  45   05   04   85   04   05   04   85   04   04   85   04 Last stung .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   85   04 Each string is obtained by suppressing the first word ? ing string  . 
of the preced-
AUTOMATICANALYSISO FSENTENCEST RUCTURES 217 The dictionary emphasizes the identical strings whatever their position in the sentence might be  . A sample of the dictionary is given in Table 1 . 
For example , the string 05   04 which means an adjective followed by a common oun at the end of a sentence has the rank number  244  , occurs 9 times in the sentences number 9 ,  10 , 35 and so on . 
All the strings beginning by the groups 05 , 04 are also listed . 
3. SENTENCESTRUCTURE
The last step of the analysis is the production of sentence structures  , using the correlations between two consecutive words  . 
We can compare the probability Pj of a word j in the corpus and the conditional probability Pj  ( if i ) of the same word when the preceding word is given equal to i  . We shall call in this paper " degree of correlation " the logarithm of the ratio of the conditional probability and the probability : 
C,s = Logs P ~ ( ifi)/P ~
The degree of correlation will be positive when the probability to get a word is increased by the knowledge of the preceding word  , and negative when this probability is decreased . It is a measure of the " affinity " of two consecutive words  . 
This procedure can be generalized by considering roups of more than two words  , not necessarily consecutive . 
For each sentence of the corpus we can build a structure based on the correlation between two consecutive words in the following way  . Inside the sentence , consecutive words are connected two by two in order of decreasing degree of correlation  . For instance in the sentence :
She loved a good laugh we have the following degrees of correlation : 
She loved = 2 . 56 loved a = 1 . 23 agood ~2 . 38 good laugh=1 . 8 6   218 ANDI~ETRETIAK OFF Therefore the first words to be connected are She and loved then a and good  . We will consider that their union is the first level  . Then the word laugh will be connected to the group a good  . This union will be a second level and finally the two halves of the sentence are connected and this union will be the third level  . 
This structure can be represented by the following graph  , automatically produced by the computer , and by the string 1   3   1   2 obtained by writing the sequence of the successive lvels  . 
SENTENCENO 923 144 SHE~2 . 5641~2321 LOVED ~1 . 2323~23345 A~o2 . 3791~?234,5GOOD~~o1 . 8602~2354 LAUGH ~
Degrees of correlation :
She loved .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .  2 . 56 loved a .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .  1 . 23 a good .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .  2 . 38 good laugh .   .   .   .   .   .   .  1 . 86
String of groups : 440145
String of levels : 1310 504
This procedure has been applied for all the sentences of the text  , producing strings of numbers which represent the structure of these sentences  . 
For each string of numbers , by suppressing the highest number we obtain 2 strings representing 2 substructures of this sentence . 
We carry on this procedure till the string has only  1 number , that is to say represents he structure of a group of  2 words . 
For instance the structure of the sentence Her daughter gave mean Italian less on everyday is represented by the following string of numbers : AUTOMATICANALYSISO FSENTENCEST RUCTURES  219

For example , the structure 1   4   2   1   3 has the rank number 65 and is found 5 times in the sentences number 12   16   21   24   41  . 
5. CLASSIFICATIONERRORS
If the structure of a sentence is unsatisfactory , this can be due to an error in the classification of a word of this sentence  . This observation is used to detect and correct classification errors  . For example in the sentence :
But come mother 8t 02 24
I like to 440117 f


I220 ANDP . EETRETIAKOFP the word come had been classified in a wrong group  02   ( indicative of intransitive verbs )  . When corrected (22 = infinitive of intr . verbs ) we obtain the following structure :
But I like to come mother 81   44   01   17   22   24 t 1 tI
I--I


Another way to check the classification of words into groups is to use the quantity of information associated to the law of succession of two consecutive words  . It is known from communication theory that the average amount of information by word is reduced when we know the law of succession of two consecutive words  . This reduction is precisely equal to the average degree of correlation of all the groups : ~ j We shall call it quantity of information associated to the law of succession of two consecutive words  . 
In order to check the validity of the choice of the grammatical group for a word  , the quantity of information associated to the law of succession of the groups is measured  . Then , changing the choice of the group , the quantity of information is measured again for this new classification  . The greater the quantity of information associated to a law of succession of the groups  , the better the distribution of these words into these groups  . 
6. CONCLUSION
The sample chosen here ( a novel by S . Maugham of 3500 words ) is too short to obtain significant frequencies for the different structures  . 
This sample contains 200 sentences of an average length of 17 words . 
In spite of the simplicity of the method Of analysis employed  ,   72 sentences of an average length of 10 words have been correctly analysed . 
This shows that the correlation of 2 consecutive words , although insufficient , will play an important part in the more elaborated methods of analysis that we are now developing  .
