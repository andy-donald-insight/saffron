This paper describes a system of representation of nouns denoting portions  , segments and relative quantities of entities , in order to account for this case of part-whole relationship  . The semantics of both constructions denoting portions a ad nouns used to build them arc discussed and eventually formalised in a unification-based formalism  ( LKB-IA ~ L ) in terms of Pust ciovsky's Theory of Qualia and Jackendoff's Conceptual 

1. Introduction and Motivation
Processes of inference of meaning concerning part -whole relations can be drawn from a lexicon bearing meronymic links between words  ( ef . \[WAI ~881) e . g . 
component-whole links ( hand-arm ) , member-collection ( tree-forest ) and so . The case of portions , segments and relaliv c quantities of objects or substances  ( lices , lumps , buckets , spoon . rids , grains , tops or tips of things ) is the exception , since this is a relation which is encoded in the language by means of constructions  . Coutrm'y to that which some authors posit ( \[ CIIAS8\] , \[ WIN87\]) , it doesn't seem to be a productive linguistic gencr ~ disation to set in a lexicon some part of link between slice and cake  . In any case , such relalion would exist between cake and slice of cake-namely  , the part of relalions houhlst and between slice and any slice able thing  . 
Generally speaking , the relation portion may be charact criscd , semantically , in I hat lhew hole pre-exists the part and the part retains most of the properties of lhe whole  ( \[IRI88\] )  , and , syntactically , as surfacing in < X of NP > structures , being potentially < X > an apparently heterogeneous collection of words which  , henceforlh , billowing\[CO1? ) 2\] We will refer to ~ tsPartitive Nouns ( l'Ns )  . 
On Ih cother hand , portions denoted by such constructions differ from their wholes in some aspects  , basically iudividuation , quantity , process of bringing about , and shalx : . Such properties , ince they are present in < X of NI ~ but they were not in <  N1  ) > , are assumed to be carried to the coust ruclion by the noun  ( < X > )  . 
I'll try to show here I hat it is plausible to give a glob~d account of such heterogeneous set of words  , since they bear a range of common and distinctive linguistic features  , and 1'11 try to provide a representation feasible for NLP which account both for PNs as a general class and for the homogeneous subclasses which wilh in them could be distinguished and defined  1  . 
2. Framework
We assume some general familiarity with the framework Wc work within : LKB-I  , Pd  ~ ( \[CO1?32\] ) as a formalism of computational representation , The Geueralive Lexicon ( \[ P\[1S95I ) as a theoretical ground l br the fonm disatiou of lexical signs  , and Conceptual Semantics ( \[JAC91\] ) for the conceptualisation of parts and Ixmndaries of entities  . 
LKB-I~RL is an IIPSG-liko formalism based on typed feature structures  ( \[CAR92\] ) developed within the Acquilex Project which makes use of unification and mechanisms of defaull inheritance  . There are four basic levels of representation : ( ) RTII , CAT , SEM and RQS . CAT encodes syntax using a eategorial grammar approach  , so there are simple ( e . g . noun : N ) and complex ( e . g . adjective : N/N ) categories . It is to be noticed that in complex categories the active element is not a category but a lexical sign  , in a way that selective restrictions may be set at this level by specifying the semantic type or other features of the selected sign  . SEM encodes logic , 'd semantics , RQS is basically equivalent to Pustejovsky's Qualia 
Slru Cltlre ( henceforth QUAI , IA).
The Theory of Qualia is embedded in that of the Generative Lexicon and has as a basic aimlo improve compositionalily by endowing lexical signs with a rich internal structure which accounls for different facets of human knowledge about lexical-semantic content  , in a way that , iu many cases , it allows for avoiding listing separatentries to account for lexic ~ dpolysemy  .  \[  PUS95\] posits the lexical entry to be constituted by fours tn ~ ctures : Fveut  , Argument , Lcxical-lnheritauce and QUALIA . The latter consists of lout Quales : Agentiv c ( origin or ' bringing ~ d?mt ' of objects )  , Telic ( purpose and function ) , Formal ( I hat which distinguishes it with iu a larger domain : magnitude  , shape , dimcusionality ) and Constitutive ( relation between au object and its constituents or \[\]' his work has been dcvelopped for Spanish  . 
Notwithstanding , for case of exposition ,   1'11 exemplify the discussion by means of examples of English-when possible  . In any case , for what concerns us here , Spanish and English are , hoth semantically and structurally , strongly comparable-the kernel < PN of NP > comes out in Spanish as a literal translation  , < I)N de NP > .

\ [JAC91\] posits that speaker stmderstand and schematise a range of phenom cua such as mass-cotHlt distinction  , plurality , parlilive conslruclions and boundary words in terms of clement my conceptual feature such as dimension ~ dity  , idealised boundm'ies and internal structure , lie introduces features\[_B\] ( botm daries being or not in view or of concern ) and \[+ I\] ( entailment or not about internal structure ) for lx ) thobjects and events as expressing lhegenerality of phenomena of boundedness and plurality-the notion of + I is present in one or another way in  \[   TAL78\]   ( cf . 
\[JAC91\]),\[KR 1871 ( of . \[COt ?) 2\]) and \[ LAK87\] ; that of boundedness in \[ LAN 91\] . This feature system comes out as : + B-I : individu~ds  ( a pig ) /closcd events (  , lohn ran to the store ) + B+I : groups ( a committee ) /bound c dilerativ c events ( the light Jlashed until down ) -BI:substances ( water ) /unbounded homogeneous processes (  , lohnshept)-B+I : aggregates ( buses , cattle ) /unbounded iterativ c processes ( the light flashed continually ) Moreover , he posils that boundaries of entities are conceptualised as minimal elaborations  ( notated e ) of their ideal topological boundm'ies ( i . e . the tip of the tongue is tile portion which conesponds to a minimal elaboration of tile  0-dimensional point which would ideally be the tongue'stip )  . 
3. Portions and Partitive Nouns
A portion designs a bounded region within a domain  ( \[ I . AN91\]) , hence tile pollion is an individuated entity ( even in tile case tile whole be a substance or m , 't , ;s) . 
The syntactic effect is that , as pointed out in \[ VOS94\] , the construction which dcnolcs the portion is syntactically countable  . 
A portion , an individuated ( bounded ) , object has a shape different from thai of the whole  . This information is contribuled to tile conslruclion by tile PN  . There are PNs which clearly specify shape ( ROI ) AJA , lunzp ) while others underspecify il ( fragment ) . Ill many cases , PNs , as a cljectives do , predicale properties of the portion , specially shape ( tile translation of Spanish RODAJA must be lhe paraphrase round slice  ; a lath of anything is saliently elongated ) or size , but also thickness , consislency or others ( as in the c ; me of MI ) ; NDRUGO , equivalent oportion ( of bread ) except for lhefact that entails that
I hebread is not fi'esh bul stale).
A portion always conveys a measure wilh relation to tile total magnitude of tile whole  . Therefore , nouns such as bucket , slice , lump or grain are relaliv cquantifiers in tile sense of  II~AN91\]: a relative quanttfier is so called because it specifies a quantity in relation to are J ?  . rence mass ; in the de~mlt-case inteJpretation , this reference mass consists of the maximal instantiation of the pertinent categoJy  ( i . e . its ftd lextension in all conceivable worlds ) . 
A portion has been oblained by a diflbrent process lhant he whole : a cake has been obtained by baking it  , but a slice o1'cake by cutting it offtile cake . The meaning of portions is many times tightly related to such agen live process-if one has obtained's lices ' it necessarily has been by culling somelhing  ; there even exists the verb to slice . As pointed out in \[ PUS95\] , knowledge of ' coming into being ' is a property of nominals which has remarkable linguistic consequences since it can account for a reduction of lexical polysemy  . I : or instance , tileSpanish phrase IIACERPAN\[to-make bread\ ] means baking bread  , whilst IIACERRI ~ , BANADAS ( DEPAN ) \[ to-make slices ( of bread ) \] means licing ( bread )  . This way , the very same verb IIACER shows two radically different meanings  , which in principle should be listed scpm-alely in the lexicon  . Nevertheless , both can be accounted for in a single entry which selects the 
Agentive Role of the complement.
More specifically talking about the lexical signs wc call PNs  ,  \[  IXO77\] shows that lhey correspond to the classifiers in languages as Tzeltal  , Mandarin Chinese or Viemamese . In languages wilh classifiers , these words , semantically strongly similar to deterin in crs and quantifiers  , have functions of individuation and enumeration , making surface notions such as sorl of entity , shape or measure . E . g . 
the Chinese phrase SANBENSIIU is translatable by three plane-entity book  ; three whiskies wotfld be conslructed with a mensural classifier  , being the translation paraphrasabl c by three unit /doses whisky  . 
\[ IXO77\] makes notice lhalwords such as head ( of cattle )  , sheet ( of paper ) or lump ( of sugar ) slaIId for exactly tile same function as classifiers in those languages  . Specifically , lttmp operates simultaneously as both a mensural  ( meaning conventional dose ) and class al ( denoting a cerlain type of aggrcgale ) classifier . 
Some have assumed I hat PNs select mass nouns ( slice of cake , glass of wine ) , being mass nouns the way in which substances tipically surface in tile language  . Instead , we posit that PNs select both kinds of nouns ( count or mass ) denoting both kinds of things ( individuals or subslances )  , but in any case , crucially , surl'acing as expressing cumulative l'eli3rence . 
Let's consider t ~ OI ) A . IAI ) EI . IMON\[round-slice of lemon \] . To assume that \] . IMON here is mass entails assuming that it has undergone adcrivation ~ d'g rinding ' rule which converts countable individuals in masses  . Nevertheless , around-slice of lemon is always a slice of some individualemon  , not a special measure of substance which some time in the past was ' lemon '  . In any case , if a ' lemon ' weren't an individuated and bounded thing  , it couldn't be sliced and tile shape of tile portion wouldn't depend on that of the whole  . The confusing point is that I , IMON intile example , RODAJADI : LIMON , surfaces grammatically as substances usually do- namely  , zero-delermined . Bulzero-detcrlninalion is not exclusively a ressource to refer to substances  , it is the way of expressing cumulative rclcrence . Both individuals and substances may be refered to cumulatively  , that is , bcconstrued as an indiffer cntiated ~ unassment . This surfaces in the language as a zero -determiner plustile wine  )  , and either in singular or plural in the case of individuals  ( a slice of lemon , a baske to flemons ) . 
St ) , in our poinl of view PN slipically select the n Ollll of the whole as it surfaces when conSll ' uing cumulative reference-bulth is doesn't compuls or ilyen lails neither lhereferent is a substance nor it is refcred to bylli Oall S of a llllSSll OHll  , ht lhecase of individuals , referenl still are bounded things , hence both they can be sliced and the shape of lheir portions still can depend on that of the original whole  . We can't go further with Ihe issue here but , at last , what the discussion above stands for is that human conceptualisation is c  ( mside , ' ed as I he cause , and the mass-count distinction , as tb . esurface effect . 
PNs are not straightforwardly referential , as they predicate wilh reference Io another entity  . This may Ix : noticed considering sentence such as '? ?  . h ; hnr ite a slice or ?? Idt-att gllt three CU l ) S . They arc semantically tm complele as they don't allow the hearer to relric vefl ' om I hem the information the speaker wanls Io convey  , l : url her information as in , lohnate a slice of cake or It was an excellent cq\[lee  . Idraught three cups is needed to do the task . When appearing in the discourse , PNs need of further specificalion of the referent  , either via of-compleine nlalion rvia ellipsis or anaphora  . Consequetltly , they cannot bctnnary bul relational predicates in I he sense of \[ I  , AN91 l , thai is , terms which are predicates cmly with reference to some other entity  . 
A basic linguistic t'e alllre of PNs is lhalthey , as relational predicates , bear seleclional restrictions . 
Namely , each kind at : PNC all combine with cerlain reler catial lOt lllS but Call  11o1 combine wilh others , depending on ccrlainf calt lrcs of tile refcrelllial tlOUXl  . 
These fealures are n lostly linguistic ( type , countabilily , singular or plural ) bul also can depend on knowledge of the world ( physical slale , etc . ) . We hypothesise that , in general , distinctions belween classes of PNs contcerning selectional restrictions must be due to linguistic reasons  , while further specifications within each class would be due to properties of the referent  , l : ,  . g . , it could be asstlmed that containers ( CUlrV , baskets ) select \[- BN items ( substances and plurals )  , and more specifically , cttps select liquids and baskets non-liquids . 
4. Sorts of PNs
We are not committed here to represent individuation of groups  ( temn , committee ) or aggregates ( cattle , fim fiture ) , haour background ontology , which is in lended to represent things in the world as conceplualised by humans  ( rigA )  , these conslilute a different class since , in this class of words , speakers ' conceptualisalion focuses not on the elemenl entities but in their aggregation  , l ' lurals are considered as representing an aggregation  ( I herefore a-B+t concept ) of bounded things ( therefore cith cr individuals or groups ) by means of a derivative ( lexical ) rule applied on signs denoting those elements ( fig . 2) - e . g . cow --> cows , team --> teams ; but gold , callle -->* golds /* callles ) .

They are individuations of preexisting parts of the whole  . They select \[+ II entities , either individuals or substances . They are not committed to an Agentive process as they may remain attached to the whole  . 
Shape and measure , if considered relevant , are inherent to the portion itself . 
Boundaries ( BOUND ) ( the tip of the tongue , the su(~we of these a , the top of a box ) . They are idealisations of physical boundaries of the whole  .

Their shape is tightly related to I hat of the whole btt one of their dimensions is concepmalised as close to non-existence  ( \[JAC9l\] )  . Analogously , they denote a minimal quantity of the whole . 
Bolh Detached ( IY\['CII ) ( a slice of cake , a slice of lemon ) and Modelled ( MI ) LI ) ) portions ( a lumpo . fsugar , a sheet of pcq?er ) have been drawn out of the whole and bear a shape straightforwardly determined by such Agen live process  .

Something similar happens with relative quantification  . While the measure conveyed by CONT , ELT and MI)LD is absolute , that of BOUND and DTCttl ) is relative : a top of a box or a slice of bread will be bigger or smaller depending on tile magnitude of the box or the loaf of bread  . 
Composition 5. Representation
To represent PNs in the LKB we have made some interpretations for FORMAL aud CONST Quales of the QUALIA  . 
We assume that the minimal and most basic FORMAL distinction among entities  ( as conceptualised by speakers ) is that of their bouudedness or not in terms of \ [   JAC91\]  . Therefore , this Quale will be a ~ signed to one of both types ( or a coherent subtype )  . Similarly , the miuimal constitutive distinction to be done is assumed to be that of entaihnent or not about internal structure of 
ORTI1:'cake '
CAT : NP
SEM:cake(y )
QUALIA : 1"THLIC : eat\]
LAGENTIVE : bake things . The ref l ) re , the CONST role will be assigned to one of both \ [_+I \] types  ( is tr true / is tr false )  . 
In this way , selectional restrictions of PNs will be basically defined as selection of signs hearing appropriate type slot their FORMAL mid CONST 

As defined ill\[PUS 951 , SltAPE ~ mdmagnitude ( MAGN ) are features of the FOR MAL Role . Their values cml be , as discussed above , either absolute or relative , depending on tile kind of portion . In the latter cases , SIIAPE and MAGN of portions will be a function of file corresponding values of file QUALIA of tile whole  2  . This interpretation of the MAGN feature accounts for the nature of relative quantifiers of 

At their turn , \[+ I\]CONSTs be ~ the feature ELTS e . g . riee:QUALIA:CONST:ELTS : grain . ( vid . 
\[\] ACgll , , also \ [ CO 1?)21).
\[ PUS95\] ( assuming\[VIK94\] interpretation ) attributes the CONST Role the function of representing the predicative relation PartOf  . 
Coherently , we assume CONST as encoding a relational predicate R  ( x , y ) , being Raty petaxonomically daughter of PartOf . In the default case , R will be ' Portion ' and in more finegrained cases  , a daughter type of it-e . g . ' Slice ' . 
The Logical Semantics of PNs ( SEM ) will account for their both pm'titive and relational nature by adopting as predicate-  , ' ugulnent structure that of their CONST Role . For the sake of unification , in the LKB , SEM will be the conjunction of this predicate and the SEM value of the sign deuoting the whole  . 
qhisway ( vid . fig . 3) , that of's lice of cake ' will result in SLICE(x , y ) & CAKE ( y ) -thus accounting /' or the logics of John eats a slice of cake as EAT  ( e , John , x ) & SLICE(x , y ) & CAKE ( y ) versus that of John eats cake as EAT ( e , John , x ) & CAKE(x ) . 
2 \[  JAC9I \] develops a method to formalise relative shapes including judgements about dimensionality  . 

For ease of exposition , the syutax ( CAT ) of PNs is represented here as the colnplex category N/NP_sigu  , where the NP_sign is app !' opriately lex-poriion -sign ~  . ' A'I':NP1CAT:/NPSIGN=ISEM:P ( y )  = \[2\]

Concluding Remarks In lhispaper we presented a system of representation of relational nouns denoting per'lions  , segments and relative quanlities of entities according Io the Theory of Qualia  ( \[ PUS95\] )  , which has been parlially reinterpreted and adapted to the insights of Concept md Semantics  ( \[JAC91\] )  . This syslem accounts for a range of linguistic facts  , being the most remm'kable the following : 1 . Portions m'e mainly encoded in the language by means of constructions in slead of by single lexical units  2  . Portions are both bounded entities aml relative measures of the wholes of reference  3  . Portions inherit li'om their wholes their purpose or function  , but , on the contrary , they show distinctive shape , mafimlude and origin 3 Possibly also \[- B\] collections ( groups )   ( a wag on of cattle )  , but , as said before , we ' renot commited here to discuss individuation of collections  . 
4 . Partitive Nouns ( PNs ) select whole-denoting nouns according to the properties of the referent wholes  , 'ks conceptualised by speakers PNs havc been classified according to the semantic regulmities they show  , resulting in a system of five basic types , which have been represented in a unification formalism  , LKB-LRL(\[COP92\]) , allowing for composition of PNs ( e . g . slice ) and NPs ( e . g . cake )   ( plus these manlically void preposition ' of ; in Spanish , DE ) into portion-denoting signs ( e . g . 
slice of cake).
