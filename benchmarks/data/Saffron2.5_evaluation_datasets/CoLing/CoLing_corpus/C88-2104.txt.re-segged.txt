In this pa-y , er , I will adhere to this approach . 
The most important reason for doing this is the fact ~ hat  , on the assumption of existence of PP , it is impossible to generates ~ ich sentences as ( 1 ) in the GPSG context . -free framework . 
(I ) I went there with John and with Paul , who met each other before . 
The point is , that in ( I ) , on the assumption ~ f the existence of PP , we find a PP-coordi--r ~ tion , resulting in a PP , rather than an NP one . Consequently , the relative clause must be sister of this PP rather than of an NP  . 
lint this is ( at \] . east in my opinion ) hardly a ~ acceptable solution , both intuitively and formally . Even an attempt to cope with this or oblomby means of rightward " A cross-the-Poard " extraposition would not make things better  , since such a solution would presume phrases as " John whome teach other " to be correct English NP's  . I do not wish to pursue this further here , the problem is more thoroughly described in ( 01iva , 88) from both intuitive and formal viewpoints . What I real-ly wanted to do was to motivate the decision of avoiding the term PP in this paper  ( and , possibly , the necessity of omitting it from the CPSG framewor \] e altogether  )  , which will be reflected in the notation of rules  . Thus , assuming otherwise the notation familiar from ( Oazdar , Klein , Pullum and Sag , 85)  , the category PP\[PFOR~z\]will here oasted as ~ Pf\[PREPz\]  , which should road as " NP mar-ked with preposition ~" As a special value of the feature PREP  , the value " nil " ought to be introduced , with the meaning that there is no preposition marking the NP in question  ( i . e . , the category NP~\[PREP nil \] in the new NP in the notation of  ( Gazdar , ~( lein , Pullum and Sag , 85)) . 
2 ? The Szn__tactic Function Feature
In this paper , I shall try to show some of the problems connected with omitting the traditional notion of  ( syntactic ) func-tion in GPSG , and their possible solutions ? The pay offs of the notion mentioned can be seen e  . g . on the classification of adver-~bials : each adverbial modifier  , whether expressed by an NPPREP , by an adverb , by a subordinated clause or otherwise , has its more specific meaning ( " function " ) in the sentence . With specific lexlcal units , e . g . 
with the verb " put " , this is so obvious that a " semantic " class if ication was proposed even in some of the syntactical approaches  , cfo(Bresnan and Grimshaw , 78) , and later transferred into GPSG without change , as can be seen on the presence of the feature L0C and related lexical rule introducing " put " ( 2 )  . 
(2) VP----~H\[6\], NP , PP\[+LOC
Further , two more such features , viz . MANNER and TEMP , were , unfortunately again with no systematic motivat ion  , proposed as " possible solution " for some problems of coordination in  ( Sag , Gazdar , Wasow and Weisler , 85) . These features LOC , MANNER , TEZP are , of course , no-thing else than function markers on adverbial modifiers  ( of location , of manner , of time ) ? Now the time has come to introd fice these modif iers more systematically  ; but I add two arguments in favour of such systemization before  . First , the rule (2) , explicitly sti-pulating the complement as PP ( or , alterna-tively , as NPPREP\]) , does not provide the theory with the power to generate any of  ( 3 )  . 
(3) a . I have put myspectacles somewhere , but now I cannot recall where it was . 
b . She put it where I wanted it.
The second argument comes a gain from coordi- -nation  ; neither under the traditional " categorial harmony " nor under the newly proposed theory of  ( Sag , Gazdar , Wasow and Weisler , 85) , the contrast in (4) could be explained . 
(4) a . She was killed by her husband and by his mistress  . 
boShe was killed by a hammer and by an axe.
c . * She was killed by her husband and by a hammer . 
Under the " functional " approach , however , we find in ( 4 ) a the coordination of a_~nts ( " deep subjects " )  , in (4) b the coordination of instruments ; but in ( 4 ) can attempt to coordinate a ~ and instrument is involved  , which makes this string ungrammatical . 
Thus , it seems to be advantageous to add one more item to the feature system of GPSG  , namely the feature of function ( let it be called FUNC , hence ) of the phrase in the sentence . Its values will mark the adverbial modifiers of place  ( lee )  , direction ( dir ) , manner ( mod ) , instrument ( instr ) , purpose ( purp ) , sswell as other functions of phrases , such as subject ( subj ) , direct object ( dobJ ) , indirect object ( iobj ) , predicative ( prd ) , resu\]t(eff ) , agent of passive sentences ( ag ) etc . , as is usual in the Prague Linguistic School . Further , the example ( 4 ) and the related discussion guides us to add
FUNC to the set of Head-features.
Next , we shall consider the following triadso ~ examples  , all generated by the standard GPSG grammar . 
(5) a . Kim gave S and y the book .
b . The book was given S and y ( by Kim).
CoS and y was given the book ( by Kim).
(6) a . We considered him a friend.
be He was considered a friend ( by us).
e .* A friend was considered him ( by us).
(7) a . The king made himaduke.
he ~ e was made a duke ( by the king).
e .* A duke was made him ( by the king).
The problem is clear : the Passive Metarule ( 8 ) applied on rules introducing NP's as sisters of V  0 even in cases these NP:s were not direct objects , which was not always correct . 
(8) Passive Metarule ' 4P - - - - -> W , NPIIV ~' pas\]-~--~-~W , ( ~ P\[P  ~ , P by \])) Similarly , (8) can apply to the ID-rules (9) a , (10 ) a : introducing " there " - oonstructions and clefts , respectively , yielding (9) b , (10) b , which is again obviously wrong . 
(9) a . V . ~\[ AGRNP ( there , \[ PLURZ\]\] , ~ r\[221 , NP\[PLUR 4b , VP\[AGRNP there , \[ PLUR /'\] , pas

H\[Zl4\],S+R,(NP\[PREP by\])
One more such example can be constructed if we apply the Extraposition Metarule  ( tl ) to the rule ( 12 ) a and let the Passive Metarule ( 8 ) apply to the result , as sketched in (12) a , b , Co ( 11 ) Extraposltlon Metarule ~ ( \[AGRS\]------>Wx2lAiR~Pit\]\]---%w , s(12) a . VP\[AGRS\] . . . . * Hb0\ ] , NP

It bothered Kim that Leewa selected.
s . VP\[AGRNP it ~ , pa ~--~ tt be\] , s , ( NP \[ P~P by \] ) * It was both ered ( by Kim ) that Leewa selected . 
Note that in (12) c , " it " serves as a dummy subject , i . e . it is not a personal pronoun which could be replaced by the referred noun as in " It  ( = the child ) was bothered that Leewa selected . " . * And even if this were not the case , the presence of the optional NP\[PREP by \] would in any ease rule the grammat Jeality of such sentences out  . 
Thus , some strings are generated by the standard GPSG grammar that are ungrammatical while  , on the other hand , such sentences as ( 13 ) cannot be generated by the grammar ,   sin-9e the verb " hope " is introduced by an ID-rule as in  ( 14 )  , where the role of direct object is played by a subordinated clause rather than by an accusative NP  , and thus the construction cannot undergo passivization via the Passive Metarule  ( 8 )  . Similar situation occurs with " concede " etc . , cf .  (15) . 
(13) That he would sing was hoped by every body.
(14) VP--~II , Sfin ) (15) VP ~ H , ( ~ P\[PI~m ) to \]) , ~\] fin\]Thus we arrive to the basic insight concerning passivization : that  , generally , such verbs may be passivized which s ~ b categ prize ~gr direct object  , irrespectively to the means by which this diFeet . .pb~ect is realised ( NP S .   .   .   ) : Another important point in " the j ) assivi-zatlon process ( as viewed in transformational grammars ) is that the directob'e ~ in active construction becomes the sub ~@_~% in the passive one  . In the GPSG framework , this shift must be reflected in the passive counterpart of the active ID-rule  , otherwise the grammar will generate ( 16 ) b as the passive counterpart of ( 16 ) a , while , again , i % will not be possible to generate (13) , for the FSD 11 , assumed in ( Gazdar , Klein , Pullum and Sag , 85) and repeated here as (17) , will force the \[ AOR NPffNF0m ~norm\]\] to be Instantiated on the VO and thus will rule out the possibility of non-NP subject occurring inhesentence I  .

Thus we arrive to the shape ( 18 ) of Passive Metarule for
Direct Objects.

Second , the bracket pairs " ( " and " ) " mark off mutually bound optionality when used around the same category-in this rule-the case is that of  ( \[ AGRX\] ) and ( X )  , i . eo con-oerning\[AGRX\] , either there is \[ AGPX\] in the mother of the pattern rule and then  , con-sequen?1y , X\[FUNCag\]occurs as the licens--ing category of optional agent complement in the target rule  , or there is no \[ AO~X\] in the pattern rule an athen just\[FUNCag\]is the licensing category of the optional agent  , all other features \] . eft to later instantiat-ion . This is important to allow for (19) a , b ; note , however , that the verbs in % hls example are of different subcategorization classes 
V\[2\] and V\[20\], respectively2.
(19) a . Lee was both ered by Kim.
b . Lee was bothered ( that ) Kim was elected.
To prevent strings like those in ( 20 ) to be ~ enerated , we have to introduce FSD ( 21 ) which marks all categories containing \[~' T~NC ag\]as NP\[PREP by \]\]  ; if this does not contradict some other principle of feature instantiation  ( which is not the case with " bother " in ( 19 ) b , because here the agent is already marked as S by the licensing rule  )  3  ( 20 ) a . * Lee was both ered Kim .

(21) FSD:\[FUNCag\]~\[N , +\ ]  , \[ V , -\]  , \[ PREP by \] Further , to prevent (22)% obe generated , it is necessary to add FCR ( 29 ) to the metagrammar . This move , however , together with exam-Dies ( 24 ) and analogs ( (24 ) b will be of particular interest )  , will lead us to a profound reconsideration of the roles and mutual relations of features COMP/PREP and FUNC  . The matter is that , given the metagrammar in its current shape , (24) b cannot be generated , because FUNC is considered to be a Head feature and - thus  , in virtue of the Head Feature Convention , \[ FUNC subj\]will be forced on the second subject sentence  ; but since this will be lacking the \[ COMP that \ ] specification  , it will be marked as unacceptable by (23) . 
(22) a .* For us to be elected b others S and y.

I Iow to solve this problem ? For inspiration , \] . et us turn to the classical and wellknown analogy between verbs with complementizers and nouns wi th prepositions  , shown in (25) , (26) . 
(25) a . That S and y was dismissed both ered I , ee.
bo * S and y was dismissed bothered Lee ? ( 26 ) aoKim waited for Leslie . 
b . ~ Kimwaited Leslie ?
At first glance , there is some disci . epancy between (24) b and (25) b , in respect to the basic idea of coordination in ( Gazdar , Klein , Pullum and Sag , 85) , namely that each member of a coordinated construction should be able to appear alone in place of the entire coordination structure  . The same case will be , naturally , that of (26) b and (27) ? (27) Kim waited fox . Lee and Leslie . 
Of course , the matter is that in ( 24 ) b and ( 27 ) the COMP and . PREP , respectively , belong to the whole coordination , not to its first member solely , and - thus extracting the second member to stand alone as shown in  ( 25 ) b , (26) bis wrong-it is , in fact , not the whole second member being extracted ; one its indivisible part gets lost somehow , and thus it is only natural that the resulting string is ungrammatical  . The second observation % obe made is by far more important in its scope : from the comparison of examples  ( 25 ) a vs . 
(25) b and (26) a vs . (26) b , iti . s clear that the role of constituent having some function in the sentence can be played only by a ful-i/f__~eeified phrase of the appropriate type  ( i . e . , in (25) , the role of ( sentential ) subject by a sentence containing " that "- comple -ment  , in (26) , the role of ( prepositional ) object by a noun phrase containing the concerned preposition  )  . And the same holds also vice versa , i . e . no underspeclfied phrase can play the role of the constituent having the function in question  . In other words , whenever the complement or preposition is expan . -ded in the generation process , the " rest " of the phrase must not be any more marked as having the function the " whole " phrase has  . 
This is just what is expressed in the COMP and PREP expansion rules  ( 28 ) a , b .

4963. Conclusions
It was shown that a new feature denoting syntactic function of a phrase should probab-ly be added to the feature system of GPSG  , which will help make the theory more adequate . This feature proved to be useful not only in some technicalities  , but even in the intuitive and explanatory background of the theory  . The bulk of support material for this new feature was taken from passiviza-%ion of constructions with direct object in this paper  , but similar evidence for the new feature can be drawn also from other types of passivization  ( of constructions with indirect objects , p : ceposltional complements ( " A doctor was sent for . ") or adjuncts (" This bed has been slept in . ")) , as well as from other types of extraposition ( cf . the impossibility of generating sentences like " It w~s hoped by every body that he wouldsing  . " in the standard GPSG ) and yet other sources . 
Adding the syntactic function feature to " the GPSG  ( mete ) grammar goes in certain aspects in parallel with the independently motivated efforts to eliminate metarules from GPSG altogether and/or to shift their work to lexical redundancy rules  , e . g . ( Pollard , 85), ( Kilbury , 86) . This fact only confirms the old wisdom that , given some linguistic informat-ion , the Question of dividing it between grammar and lexicon may be decided rather arbitrarily  . The i ~ ortant point is that the proposals made here do not require such radical changes in the GPSG framework as the " le-xlcal " approaches do  , i . e . , they keep better the basic spirit of the current GPSG  ( while solving the problems shown at least equally well  )  . The only points in which areally substantial change occurred in this paper was  , first , the structure of PP , and , second , the stipulation that purely morphological chara -cteristics of constituents is insufficient for the description of English syntax  . Put I hope that in the light of the data presented these moves appear to be fully Justified  . 

I am indebted to Eva Haji~ov & , Petr Sgail , Alexandr Rosen and an unknown Coling referee for fruitful comments on the first version of this paper  , as well as to Laura J and a for a lot of the English examples  . 
I ) The status and validity of this FSD is however , somewhat unclear : it forces\[AGRNPINFORM norm \]\] to all verbal predica-tes which are  , lot marked otherwise in the respective ID-rule . Consequently , such verbs as " bother " must be listed in the lexicon twice '  , each time with different subcategori-zatlon class  , but in both cases subcategorlz-ingfox ' identical complements  ( and , hence , there have to be two almost identical lexical rules in the grammar  , one for each of the classes ) . This , in turn , makes the ( otherwise i simple and clear ) sentence ( i ) ambiguous , while on the other hand , due to this FSD none of the sentences in ( ii ) , ( iil ) can be generated . 
( i ) Kim was bothered.
(li ) That John would not come was obvious.
That Kim was elected gave S and y the satisfaction.
( iii ) It was obvious that John would not come . 
It gave S and y the satisfaction that Kim was elected  . 
On closer observation , a lot of verbs can ( appropriate pragmatic conditions provided ) take a sentential subject : the ~ brute force " method for coping with this fact would be to increase the size of rules and lexlcal entries  , as performed with " bother " and ana-logs in ( Oazdar , Klein , Pullum and Sag , 85) . 
More appropriate solution ( at least in my opinion ) would be to soften the FSD 11 to the form ( iv )  , and simultaneously to stipulate that only verbs ' taking exclusively sentent lalsubject  ( if they exist ) or exclusively nominal subject ( e . g . " believe " , " hope " ) would be marked as such ? ( iv ) FSD 11:\[v , +\]  , \[BA  ~ , o1 ( \[AGRNP\[NF0im norm\]\]\]to r\[AGRS\] ) Generating ( iii )  , however , requires further replacing the\[AGES\]spec if ication in the mother of the pattern rule in the Extraposition Metarule wlth ~\[ AGRNP\] specification  .
