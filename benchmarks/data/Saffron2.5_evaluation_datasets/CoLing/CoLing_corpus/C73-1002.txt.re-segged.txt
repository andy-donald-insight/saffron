MORPHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS ( AFORMAL APPROACH)
1. MOTIVATION ANDBASICIDEAS
Since 1972 a researcher team in Bonn has been working on the
automatic syntax-analysis of the german language . The morphoJogical analysis is a part of this work that has already been formalized and programmed by the author  . We can consider the following paper as a generalization f this formalize description  . 
In this first chapter some expressions like " text " or " lexicon " are considered clear by intuition  . Later on we'll get to know the exact definitions . The basis of each description of a text of any language is a morphological nalysis of this text  . One can easily agree that such a description has to be derived from the words or sentences of the text which is to be described  . The expression " description of a text " is understood in a very general sense  . . One can imagine asyntactic description or a semantic interpretation racombination of both of them or any other information  . 
In a natural anguage the number of the possible texts is not finite  . 
That's easy to prove because of the following sentences : 
One is a number
Two is a number
Hence it's impossible in practice to use a lexicon of the following form text  1 description of text 1 text 2 description of text 2 o , w ? . ?10 ~ rERNERBRECHT for all texts of a language . There remains only one possibility . One has to ascribe the words and sequences of words which every text consists of with one or more  ( homography ) descriptions . Then one can try to derive the descriptions of the text out of the descriptions of the words or sequences of words  . 
2. BASIC DEFINITIONS 2.1. Remark.
Let A and B be sets . Then denotes :
P ( A ) : the set of all subsets of A ( the power set of A ) 
A *: the freemonoid over A
A ? B : the cartesian product of A and B
Ixl : the " length " of x ~ A * ( the number of elements of A which x consists of )   ; Ixl ~ IN . 
Now we'll define the expressions " character " and " string " for a language  . We use five basic sets : LETT := A,B,G, . . . , Z the set of " letters " DIG := 0, 1, 2, . . . ,  9 the set of " digits " BLANK : =  L_a  =:  blank , /t . _a /= 1, I_ . .a E BLANK * PS : = . U , U ! U . . . the set of " punctuation-signs " SS :=%, &, ~, . . . the set of " special-signs "
From these five sets we derive : a ) CHAR := LETTUDIGUBLAN KUPSUSS the set of " characters " If x ~ CHAR  , we say : " x is a character " . 
b ) CHAR *: the freemonoid over CHAR.
If x ~ CHAR * , we say : " x is a string " or : x is a sequence of characters " or : x is a text " c  ) LISS := LET TO DIGUSS the set of " Characters without blank and punctuation-signs " d  ) LISS *: the freemonoid over LISS . 
If x ~ LISS * , we say : " x is a string without blank and punc -tuation-signs "  . 
MORPHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS 112.2. Remark.
\[ LISScCHAR = ) LISS * cCHAR *\] = ) \[ e ~ LISS * , e empty element ~) e ~ CHAR * , eempty element \] Now we define the expression " word "  . 
2.3. Definition.
W ORD1 : ~ x\]x~BLANK * AJX\[>OWORm:---- xIx ~ LISS *  ,   , I ~1 > O

If x ~ WORD , we say : " x is a word ".

3 . THE IN PUTFOR THE MOR PHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS Our analysis will accept every x ~ CHAR *  . 
3.1. Remark.
x ~ CHAR * , Ixl = 0 ( x = e ) is a trivial case because there is no-thing to analyse  . 
Let x be a text , x ~ CHAR * . If we want to analysex , we say : " x is the input for the analysis " or for short : " x is the input "  .

MORPHOLOGICAL ANALY SIS 155 . REMARKSTOTHECONCEPT'~LEXICON"?In using the expression " lexicon " all actions identifying and describing words  , sentences and texts can be concentrated in a single concept  . 
In a formal sense any lexicon is a set of " i tems "  . 

LEX := ( w,B)x,XeA( . 4: any index-set ) The pair ( w , B ) x is called an " item " of the lexicon . 
For every item holds : a ) w = u,1w, . . . w =, m>1, wi~WORD2UPS(i = 1, 2, . . . , m)b)w~(i = 1, 2, . . . , m ) is fixed as a word or punctuation-sign of a language  . 
c ) B is any description of w.
Let 113 be the set of all intended descriptions of all sequences of words and punctuation-signs of some language  . Then
LEX?(P ( WORD )) * X1 13 such that ( . , B ) LX:b ) c ) LEX is a relation between ( P ( WORD ) )* and XB . In general a sequence wlw, . . . w = has more than one description ( by homography for example )  . Hence LEX can't be a map between ( P ( WORD ) )* and 113 . 
There are two ways to define a lexicon.
a ) The extensional definition . All the elements of the lexicon are listed off . In this case we often call such a lexicon a " l ist " 

1) A := (1 ,  2 , 3 x is element of A : ** x = 1 , , x = 2 v x ----- 3 2 ) w is a noun :** w is element of a list of nouns . 
b ) The intensional definition . All the elements of the lexicon are fixed by some common properties  .

1) A := x\[x ~ IN^O < x < 4x is element of A : . ,* x e IN ^ 0 < x < 4 2) w is a noun : ,   , w has some characteristics like prefix , suffix and
SO on.
3 ) w is a verb : ~* a part of w ( the stem ) is element of a list and suffix and prefix have some characteristics  . 
In both cases ( extensional or intentional ) the lexicon has the abstract form : w description of w  ( w , B)

Then(k(q ), k(&), . . . , k(tp )) is a permutation of ( tx , t, .   .   .   .   . tp ) . 
We call u ~( tl ), uk(t , ) .   .   .   .   . u , ( tp ) a " subsequence " of u ~ . . . u ,

Let t ~ T be such a subsequence.
Thena " morphological analysing step " related to the subsequence t  ( for short : mast ) is a relation between t and LEX . 
mast ct3 < LEX such that ( t , ( w , B )) ~ mast : ~ t = w
Case I . mast * O
Then we say : we have identified the subscquence t in our lexicon and all related B's are descriptions of t  . 
Case 2. mas t = O
Then we say : our lexicon does not ( yet ) contain the subsequence t . 
We are not able to give any description of t.
7. THE MORPHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS
The concept of the " morphological analysing step " is related to one and only one subsequence te T  . 
The concept of the " morphological analysis " however is more general  . 
Let x ~ segm ( CHAR *), x . ep , x = ulus . . . u , Let T ' be a subset of T ( T ' ~ T ) such that to every ( u  ~ ( i = 1 ,  2  . .  .   .   . n ) there exists at least one teT ' which contains u  ,  . 
18 WERNERBRECHT 7.1. Definition.
A " morphological analysis related to T '" ( for short : mar , ) of ul(u2 . . . u , ) is the set of all mast such that teT ' . 
maT , := mas , It ~ T'

Let i ~1, 2, . . . , n
Let t ~ i be a subsequence of ( ulu ~ . . . ( u , containing ( u , . 
Let T ~ be the set of all t ~.
We say that our analysis failed if there exists one ui such that mas %=  0 for all t ~ eT ~ In the other case we say that our analysis had been successful  . 
In general there are more than one T ' such that mar  , is successful . 
It has to be left to the user to fix the sets T ' for his special intentions and for his special possibilities  . 
7.2. Definition.
Let AT be the set of all T ' ( T ' defined as above )  . 
A " morphological analysis " ( for short : ma ) is the set of all mas such that there exists a T ' eAT with teT ' ma := mas ~ I ~ tT ' eAT ^ teT ' 

Let z ~ CHAR * be a text such that there exists a x = segm  ( z ) with x : #% . Then in practice we say : maisa morphological nalysis of the text z  . 
8 . EXAMPLEFORAPRACTICAL MORPHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS This example shows the practice of a morphological analysis of a german text and has indeed been programmed in Bonn to be the basis of the above mentioned syntax-analysis  .

MORPHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS 19
Then holds : masq c(u , XLEX(i -= 1, 2, . . . , n ) such that ( u , , ( w , B )) em as , , ~ w =  u , This simple case of a morphological nalysis we call a word-analysis ' of a given text  . 
We getmar , = mast ~, mast , , . . . , mas ~
Each massi(i = 1, 2....,n ) is a set too.

Hence we have to write : mar , -----(( ul , ( w , , Bu )) .   .   .   . , ( ul , ( wi , B1J ), ( u ,, ( w2, Bus)) .   .   .   .   . ( u , , ( w , , B2z ,)), ? o . 
((.n ), ( w ., B .,)), ..., (( u.),(w .,)
For short we can write : mar , :\[( u , <->(( woB , ,) ,   . . . , ( woB , q )) ( i = 1, 2 . . .   .   . n )\]
Or : maT , :\[ u ,-?> ( Bil ; Bi2, . . . , BiLi)(i-~--1,2, . . . , n ) \] No wone can see that the result of a word-by -word-analysis can easily be represented with the following matrix-concept : ul  , Bll , B 12 ,  ?  . . . . . . . . . . Blz ~ \ u ~, B~I , B ~, .   . . . . . . . . . . B2L , / , , . \ u . ,, B , a , B . 2  . . . . . . . . . . . . B . L , , In our syntax-analysis in Bonn a great deal of the morphological analysis is done by word-by -word-analysis  . We are successful in describing articles , nouns ~ adverbs , adjectives and so on , but we have some trouble with our verbs . 
In the german language the prefix of some verbs may be found far away from the stem of the verb  . 
20 V ? ~ RNE_RBl ~ CHT

The verbs zulaufen and laufen are two quite different verbs  . We will regard the following three german sentences :  1  ) EinI-Iundist mirzuge laufen . 
2) Laufmir nurnicht zu.
3) Zuistermirgelaufen.
A word-by-word-analysis will succeed only with sentence  1  )  . In 2 ) and 3 ) we ' ll find the verb laufen instead of zulaufen . That means that we get a wrong description of our verb and a wrong description of zu which  . exists in the german language also without any relation to a verb  . Therefore to analyse our verbs a word-by-word -analysis i impossible  . 
In our analysis we differ between two parts of the lexicon  . 
The first one allows word-by-word-analysis and is intensionally defined for proper-names  , nouns and adjectives and is extensionally defined for all other words without verbs  . The extensionally defined part of this lexicon consists at this time of nearly  2000 items . 
The second one is our verb-lexicon which is intensionally defined  . 
There exists an extensionally defined verb-stem -lexicon which contains at this momenthestems with their prefixes of nearly  400 german verbs . This stem-lexicon is quickly increasing and is coded in the following manner :\[  ( stem\[descriptionf " stem"\]\]\[ ( prefix ( stem\[descriptionf " prefix stem "\]\]\[ lauf\[descriptionf"lauf"\]\]\[  ( zu ( lauf\[descriptionf"zulauf"\]\]We start the morphological nalys is with a word-by-word -analysis  . 
If our analysis was successful we have got to each word of some text at least one description  . Some of these descriptions may be wrong That's because of the homography and because of the verbs  . We can't solve the homography-problem in this early part of the analysis  . 
If we have identified a word to be a verb we are looking if in the same sentence there exists a word which can be prefix of this verb  . 
If we find a possible prefix the verb gets the descriptions resulting of the prefix as well as the descriptions without this prefix  . Working in this way we get a lot of information for the words of our text  . Some information is wrong but we can be sure that the right information 
MORPHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS 21 is among the descriptions . It is left to the syntax ( or may be to the semantic ) to isolate the right descriptions . 
Formally we can describe the verb-analysis as a set of masj such that t := u'u " where u " has been recognized as a verb and u'can be every word  ( without u " ) of the same sentence in which u " exists . 
Given some textulu 2... un.
Given a word-by-word-analysis which shows that ui may be a verb  . 
T'::tIt~-u'ui^u'eul , . . . , ui . , , ui . ,,  .   .   .  ,% 
Then holds : mas , ?( u ' ulxLEX such that ( u'u , , ( w , /3)) em as ,  ? , w = u'u , One might call this procedure a " two-word -analysis "  . We can imagine a " three-word-analysis " and so ontoo  , but up to now in our practice in Bonn the morphological analysis consists only of a " word -by-word-analysis " and a " two-word-analysis " in the above shown manner  .
