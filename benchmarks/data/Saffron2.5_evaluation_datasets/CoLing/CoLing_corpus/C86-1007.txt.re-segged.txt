i . Introduction
The work reported here is being conducted as part of the LOKI project  ( ESPRIT Project I07 , "Alegio oriented approach to knowledge and databases supporting natural user interact ion "  )   . The goal of the NL part of the project is to build a pragmatically sensitive natural language interface to a knowledge base  . By " pragmatically sensitive " , we mean that the system should not only produce well-formed coherent and cohesive language  ( a minimum requirement of any NL system designed to handle discourse  )   , but should also be sensitive to those aspects o~user behaviour that humans are sensitive % oover and above simply providing a good response  , including producing output that is appropria tely decorated with those minor and semantical ly in consequential elements of language that make the difference between natural language and natural natural language  . 
This paper concentrates on the representation of the structure of conversation in our system  . We will first outline ~ here present at ion we use for dialogue moves  , and then outline the nature of the definit ion of well-formed dialogue that we are operat ing with  . Finally , we will no tea few extensions to the representation mechanism  . 
2. The HOVE frame
We are assuming a seven-slot frame for the representation of moves within a dialogue  , with the following slots : HOVE , USER , AGENT , TURN , ACT ~ BASE , CONT . Every move in a conversation is represented by such a frame  . 
The HOVE slot uniquely idenitifies apart icular move in the conversation by a narbit rary integer  . The USER slot identifies the oucrent user of the system  . The AGENT slot specifies whether it i ~ a user move o ~' a system move  . The TURN slot has the value OPEN nor CLOSEn , where n is a number that refers to a particu larex change  . Typically , a move with a value OPENn for the TURN slot might be a request  , and one with a CLOSEn value the c ~ or responding response  . 
The ACT slot specifies what act is performed by the utterance  . This will be either a speech act , or the value ACTION , since not all moves need be speech acts . The range of speech acts that the system will have to reoognise or ' produce is clearly smal ler than that which occurs in conversations between humans  . Furthermore , certain speech acts will be of primary importance given the domain of application of the system  , namely , as a frontend to an expert system . We have therefore produced an initial h ierarchy of potentially relevant speech acts  ( Waehtel 1985a )  , where the major classification is into requests  , assertions and commentaries . Some of these are referred to be low . Many of the speech acts we use go one level below what is traditionally viewed as a speech act  ( i . e . in the sense of Austin (~952) , Searle (1969) , etc .   ) and may be compared with distinctions that McKeown  ( 1985:9ff .  )  , for example , discusses under the category of " rhetorical p redicates "  , though they are by no means the same . The only speech acts discussed below a ~ e refer red to by the following abbreviations : 
REQACT request-for-action
REQAFF request-for-affipmation
SUPPAFF supply-of-affirmation
REQCONST request-for-constant
SUPPCONST supply-of-constant
REQCONF request-for-confirmation
SUPPCONF supply-of-confirmation
The BASE slot specifies the current topic , in the very restricted sense cf a pointer to the node in the ~ emantic network that corresponds to the object what the current exchange is about  . This simplistic view of topic is adopted here as a first step only  , and serves to i ~ lust rate the points discussed below  . 
The CONT slot specifies the semantic representation of the utterance  , and ween v is age using the same representation fo r semantics and for actions  , so that all possible ACT types can be represented uniformly in the CONT slot  . In particular , we will define an exchange as a pair of utterances with the same value for the CONTs lo t  , for the time being . This is of course too strict . Other functions specifying ( 1982: 227 ) are also relevant here . The particular illooutionary force of an utterance will be a function of the value of the ACT slot and the CONT slot  . Subdialogues that are not in the mainstream of the conversation will be identified by par ticular relationship of values for the TURN slot between adjacent moves  , enhanced by the values of the ACT slots for the moves  . 
Some examples of the use of this frame to represent sequences of utterances in convers at ions can be found in Waohtel  ( 1985b , 1985 o ) , including its use to identify shifts of topic  , subdialogues and relevance , as well as the contextual disambiguation of speech acts  , which is the main topic of these working papers . 
3. The structure of conversation
We assume that it is possible to define the st ructure of a possible conversation by rule  . Actual human-human conversations may defy such analysis  , as illustrated by , for example , the work of Sachs , Schegloff & Jefferson (1974) . However , the possible ways in which the conversations we are dealing with may go are severely limi ted by three factors :  ( a ) this is an interface to an expert system ( or some similarly specific software )   , which delimits the possible range of topics ;   ( b ) one of the participants in the dialogue is a machine  , which means that it will not suddenly want to indicate that  , for example , Albert's niece is a friend from school , but this fact has no bearing on the supportive things being said about her  ; and ( o ) the other participant knows that his inter locutor is a machine  , and will behave accordingly . Therefore , what we need to model is not a typically natural open human conversation  , but a restricted type of conversation that also occurs between humans in certain well-c ircumscribed contexts  . For example , a conversation between a would be passenger and a ticket clerk at a railway station is c loser to what we need to model  , and insuch oases it is possible to define what is or is not a well-formed conversation by rules of an abstract nature that may well be inadequate for other naturally occurring converations  . 
We therefore propose three rules that define the notion of well-formed conversation in the present context  , making the following assumptions . The structure of a conversation can be represented as a tree structure  . The wellformedness of such trees can be defined by rewrite rules  . The maximal number of levels of embedding in such trees is six  ( see below )  . In particular , subdialogues can be embedded within dialogues , but there can be no embedding within subdialogues  . The last restriction conflicts with what people do  . It is one of the restrictions we consider necessary  , and which can be handled in such a way that the user will not notice We assume that the fol lowing four categories are sufficient for the representation of the structure of conversation  . The symbols used serve as mnemonics for their approximate counterparts in English  , but they should not be strictly equated with them : CONV  ( conversation )   , DIAL ( dialogue ) , EXCH ( exchange ) and MOVE ( as discussed above) . 
To formulate in informal terms the general style and atmosphere of the rules that we will propose more formally below  , let us say that a CONV may consist of one or more DIALs  , a DIAL may consist of one or more EXCHs , and an EXCH consists of two MOVEs , with each of these MOVEs followed by an opt ional DIAL  . 
A major point about conversations that must be handled in a grammar of this type is the fact that although MOVEs are the only terminal nodes  , and are therefore the nodes that correspond to the utterances that are actually produced  , with all other nodes representing more abst ract elements  , certain features of conversation need to be associated with these abstract nodes  . For example , although each MOVE is specified for who the current user of the system is and each MOVE also has a particular topic  , as discussed above , these notions properly belong to more abstrac t levels of conversational structure  . Who the user is can be defined at the CONV level  ( i . e . we define a CONV as a conversation with one user  )   . The topic of an utterance can be defined at the DIAL level  ( i . e . a CONV can consist of one or more dialogues , each on a single topic ) . Furthermore , a DIAL can consist of one or more EXCHs , and it is at this point that the content of the utterances that form part of that EXCH is def in ed  . 
Let us now be more precise . We assume that some of the slots mentioned above in the MOVE frame are represented as features on the nodes in the trees representing the structure of the conversation of which the moves described by the MOVE frames are par t  . 
This association of features with nodes , plus the assumption that all feature strick le down  , with a few exceptions discussed below , provides for trees of the general form shown in Tablei  . The lowercase letters are constants . Note that the values of the BASE feature on the subdialogue nodes have not been specified  . 
We return to this point below . Table I represents a goal : the sort of struc tures we want the rules to produce  . The following three rules generate trees of this type  . 
Kleene Plus notation is used.
The notation should be interpreted as follows . Roman letters as feature values are constants . Greek letters are variables ranging over possible feature values  , and are to be interpreted consistently with in a rule ~ but not necessarily between ru les  . 
They are used to ensure that the correct

The expansion on the ~ight is only possible if the feature on the l ~! f t of the rule has the values peoified  , if both are enalosed in angle brackets . In the present ease , they are used to prevent the expansion ~ fa subdialegue as a further subdialogue  . The feature ESUBD=-3 is introduoed by the rule that expands CONV .

What this amounts to is a stipulation that the topic of a subdialogue is the EXCH that it is part of  , which seems to be about right intuitively . This is what makes them metalinguistio in character  . Furthermore , note that this is a case where a feature/va lue pair does not trickle down  . 
This is tantamount to stipulating that DIAL is a BASE-bounding node : it creates " islands " with BASEs that do not extend upwards to the main dialogue  , but without overwriting the BASE of the cur rent main dialogue  . Again , this seems intuitively correct . 
Let us now provide a concrete example of the st ructure that these rules assign to a dialogue such as  ( 4 )   .

The structure ie given as Table 2 . The values for the feature CONT are given as constants rather than as full semantic representations  , and the constants rather than as full semantic representations  , and the constant IJCAI is used for the BASE , which is the actual conference due to take place on  12 August 1985  . This value has been given in all relevant oases  , thus glossing over the fact that the BASE could not be identified immediately  , which is what triggeeed the subdialogues . We add , however , neet a in features that wece discussed earliee , such as MOVE , AGENT and ACT , too laeify how the final focm of the frame ee presenting each MOVE is deeived  . 
This is a oonveesation in which there is only oFie main dialogue arid only one maid exchange within that dialogue  . I hope that it is clear how these additional elements would be incoeporated into the st ructure  , and how the appropriate values focBASE , CON ? and SUBD would be i aa intained or changed .

This is a five-move conversation ( the system's " Yes " counts as a sepacate move )   . 
The g~ammac would assign thesteuotuee shown in formally as  ( 6 ) to the first four moves .

On formal grounds , the oon versation is closed after the fourth . move ( U : Yes ) , with all OPENed moves having been CLOSEd . What , then , trigger's the system's printing of the eequieed text  ( MOVE 5 ) ~ and what happens after that , Since an odd numbe c of moves ~ annot constitu tea well-formed conversation aeoecding to the grammar peesented above ? It is olea e that it is the meaning of MOVE  3 that is the key . To handle this fo~mally , we pcopose the use of the notion of " hypothet ical move " and the cepresentation speech aot  . ~net as atomic elements Hilt as struotuces .

MOVE4 is a SUPPAFF'(REQAFF(REQACT )), i . e ? a supply of affirmation in response to a request foc affirmation in response to a request foe aotion  . It seems quite gloat intuitively that this complex structure is equivalent " to a REQACT  , and we propose that this type of reduction should take place by rule  . 

However , this rule must not over-write the orig in a linter pretation of the illooutionacy force of the move  , which must be retained focthe dialogue to be well-formed with respect to the grammar  . We propose that the e~feot of this type of ru le  ( an implioature redundancy rule ) is t ~ create a hypothetical move immediately following it of the appropriate type  . Its effect is to alter the structure of the conversation in exactly the same way as if the user  ( in this case ) had actually uttered something like " I request you top ~ int the minutes now "  , except for the fact that it is noted that thi s is a hypothetical move  . We now have a formal entity that can trigger the printino of the required text  , since this is a CLOSure of the hypothetical move  . If no printing took place , then the dialogue would be ill-formed , since it would contain one OPEN that had not been CLOSEd  . This , the system is behaving as if the use ~ had made a particular move that did not actually occur  . 
(The not ion ' as i f ' is cent ra l to Va ih inger ' s  ( 1935 ) theory of fictions = It is al ~ ocruoial to  6rioean implicature .   ) The result is that ( 4 ) is now analysed as a six-move dialogue , with the structure shown a ~(8) .

HOVE&:S , CLOSE3, ACTION 5 . Anticipatory moves Another type of ir = eal is move is an anticipatory move  , where on the basis of specific clues the system anticipates what the user's next move will be  . The difference between these and hypotheti calmoves is that no action is taken by the system until there has been a reaction from the user that either confirms or disoon firms the correctness of the move that has been antic ipated  . The use of such moves will be of assistance in the interpretation of cryptic follow-  . ups , as in (9) .

The user's second utterance must be interpreted as a request-for-action  , which is difficult on formal grounds . Without going into too much detail , we propose that in such oases ths system should have formulated an anticipation of a follow ing utterance  . \]' his could either be an e ; ? plicit request=for-action ( " Please print the LOKA progress report " )   , or ~ imply " Yes " ( i . e . a
SUPPAFF ( REQAFF(REgACT ))) , which would trigger a system request for cla rification  , perhaps , or anything else at all tha~can serve to identify the BASE of the anticipated request -for-a Ction  . This is the important point about the antic ipatien ~ Anything  . at all that can fill in the unspecified ~ Iots in the BASE of the anticipated request- for-action will confirm that this utterance is intended as a REQACT  . 
For this reason ~ the bare name LOKAi ~ enough to get the report printed  . Any other sufficiently identifying descr iption of the relevant subprc jeot would have achieved the same  , such as any of the following < as appropria te  ) : the one based in Hamburg , Hamburg , NL , Max ' ~ projeot ~ most cee ent ~ etc . 
6. Conclusions
The processes and formalisms outlined above are all tentative in nature  , and represent part of an approach to the problem of pragmatic sensitivity  , rather than purported solutions to the problem  . We envisage then as being part of a system that uses a multi-level parsing technique  , with mutual assistance between different subcomponents of the parser  , so that pragmatic information can immediately be used to assist par~ing i for syntax  , and so on . We also see that par~ing will involve not only ~ entence parsing  , but also conversation parsing , in that the appropriate structure of a conversation must be built up at each step  . 
This is simply one further part of the general parsing process ~ but one that ween visage as being of assistance to other parser suboomponents  , as well as fulfilling its primary funct ion of making sure that the system is something of a conversationalist  , rather than just being a communicative plodder .
