1 Introduction
One of the daunting problems in machine translation  ( MT ) is the mapping of tense . The paper singles outtile problem of translating German presentense into English  . This problem seems particularly instructive as its solution requires calculation of aspect  ; as well as determination of tile temporal location of events with respect to the time of speech  . We present a disambiguation algorithm which makes use of gramularity calculations to establish the scopal order of temporal adverbial phrases  . The described algorithm has been implemented and is running in the Verb mobil system  . 
The paper is organized as follows . In sections 2 through 4 we 1 ) resent he problem and discuss the linguistic factors involved  , always keeping an eye on their exploitation for disambiguation  . 
Sections 5 and 6 are devoted to an abstract ; definition of temporal granularity and a discussion of granularity effects on scope resolution  . In section 7 the actual disambiguation algorithm is presented , while section 8 describes its performance on the Verb mobil test data  . A summary closes the paper . 
2 Present or Future ?
In contrasto English , the German presentense is commonly used to describe both present and future happenings  . One task in translation from German to English is thereforetile dismnbigua-tion of German /  ) resent tense to presentime or future time . 
(1 ) present tense ~ future time -+ presentime * This work was fimded by the German Federal Ministry of Education  , Science , Research and Technology ( BMBF ) in the framework of the Verbmobil Project under Grant  01 IV 101 U . Many thanks are due to Profi H . Kampattd K . Eberle . All errors are my own . 
2.1 Temporal Orientation
A prominent factor involved in the choice between present and future time  ( Butt ,  1995 ) is the temporal orientation of tile time adverbials that modi\[y the tensed verb  . 
Only a limited set of time adverbials can refer to presentime  . Indeed , the set is so small that it can be enumerated . The adverbials can be fhr-ther subclassified according to other times they may refer to  . 
? only present ( now , at the moment ) ? also past(just , German eben )? any time ( toda 35 this week , in the meantime , tbr two weeks ) All other time adverbials are incompatible with presentime  . 
(2) * On 19th November 2000, Isleeplate.
? Some adverbials only refer to past time ( e.g.
~ stm'da35 last week , former IL recent l ) , two days ago ) . 
(3)* I will be here yesterday.
? Others can only be used with filturc time ( tomorrow , next week , so on , in ? our d~ys) . 
2.2 Verbs Immune to Temporal
Orientation Effects
In some case stile temporal orientation of adverbials sounds a false alarm : Even though an adverbial requiring non-present syntactically modifies the tensed verb  , German present tense is translated as present ( see examples ( 4 ) from the British National Corpus )  . The effect comes about because semantically the adverbial modifies not the verb's eventuality but one of the verb's objects  .

( British National Corpus , lINe ) (' . Another storm fl'om SE . . . is expected here tomorrow .   ( BNC ) The decisive factor seems to be the verb sense involved  . Thus , for disambiguation a . list ; of such'"il\[llll\[llte"vet'bsenses ltlltSt be compiled  . Such verbs can be modified by adverbials requiring  1  ) r ( ~sent and adverbials requiring non-1 ) resent at the Sallle time .

3 Simple or Progressive ?
A distinctive feature of the English tense system th '  , ~ t is missing in German is the differentiation be ( , we ensiml ) le and t ) rogressive aspect . We t'o-(:ushere on 1 ; \]1 (: usag (: of aspect in 1) r(:sentime . 
(7) presentime -~ , ~' imple /) re , ~' ent-+l > rcs < mtt ) rogres , vi~<' . 
3.1 Linguistic N~etors
The factors involved have been thoroughly stud-ted and classitied in the linguistic literature  ( Greenbaum and Quirk ,  1990) . So we confine ourselves to a short re . view here . 
State Present . Stative verb senses get simple aspect . 
(8) a . ? We are having a house on Oxtbrd

b . We arc having dinner.
Habitual Present . A habit is a set of <: vents of the same type . In semantic tern:s , a habit arises from quantiti('ation over events . If the events extend indefinitely into the past and fi:-ture  . , the lmbit is conceived as perutancu , t " and simple aspect is used ; if the events occur over ~ limited period of time  , the habit is conceived as temporary and progressive aspect is appropriate  . A frequency adverbial can be used to speci\[y t i t  ( :  ( relative ) number of occurrences of the event . Ge . ncral . \[ acts cml be viewed as a special type of a habit  . They arc always expressed in simple as l ) ect ( see ( 9 ) ) . 
(9) Because water boils at 100 ? C , water is boiling at 100 ? C in the pot . 
Instantaneous Present . Dynamic verb senst~s that ret ' er to a single event with little or no  ( lur ~ tionoceun'ing at the Sl ) eech time are exl ) ressed with simple aspect . This type of \] ) resent is used in comment m'ies ( 10 a )  , self commentaries ( 10b ) and with performative verbs ( 10c ) referring to speech acts . 
(10)a . Joe scores a goal.
b . I enclose an apt ) lication tbrm.
(: . For I ) ermission to tmblish this paper , the authors l ; tm . nk thel)el ) : ~ rtment of
Economi (: Develol ) ment.
Durational Present . Dynamic verl ) senses denoting an in comph:tevent with dm'ation get progressive aspect  . 
(11.) a . We are looking at ; March sixteenth.
( Verbmobil corpus ) b . This is looking interesting . 
( Verbmobil corpus ) 3.2 Disambiguation
State Present; . Disambiguation requires definition and classification of all relevant verb senses according to stativity  . When in a first ap-1 ) roximation only the most fl'equent verb sense of each verb are considered  , a list ; of stative verbs can be extracted from a corpus . 
Habitual l?resent . The presence of a fie-quency adverbial points to a reading of Habitual Present  . Since every event can be construed as a general fact  , general facts arc very difficult to identify and will be disregarded  . 

Instantaneous Present . For disambiguation achievement verbs used in self comment m'ies and perfbrmative verbs need to be listed  . 
Durational Present . Present events are usually regarded as having duration  , so progressive is the default aspect for dynamic verb senses in the present  . 
4 Perfector Not ?
In a special case , Germm ~ present tense can be rendered as English present perfect : In English  , perfect is used to describe periods that begin in the past and lend up to the present  ; German uses a non-perf+ctive tnse in this situation  . 
(1.2) Wirlebenschonfi in fJ ahrein Amsterdam.
We live a h'eady five years in Amsterdam.
We have lived in Amsterdam for five years.
Whenever a period is described that begins before and still holds at speed l time  , a limitative time adverbial i is used . ( This term is due to Bras (1 . 990) . ) This peculiarity makes disambiguation very easy . 
(13) a . Eristerstzwei Wo chenhier.
lie is only t two weeks here.
He has only been here for two weeks.
b . Eristnurzwei Wo chenhier.
He is only two weekshcxe.
He is here for only two weeks.
5 Definition of Granularity
For our purposes we model the time axis as the set of rational  2 numbers Q . An interval is then a pair of rational nmnbers < s  , c ) , such that s < e . The d'u ration of an interval is the distance between start and end of the interval  ( d~Lr ( s , c )) = e-s) . On the interval structure we define the relations of inclusion  ( 143 ) and overlap ( 14t ) ) . 
(1 . 4) a . (81, c1C (82, c2) + -82 ~ . ~ s1A~1 ~ (22b .  @1 , C 1 ) 0 (82 , ('2) ~81~(32A82 ~__ e11 Limigal ; ivead verbials go with the prepositions since mid for plus temporal measure nouns in English  ; in German they occur with the preposition seit and as duration adverbials modified by schon and erst  . 
' ~ Although natural mmlbers could have been used to  ( ) , ration almm~bers are convenient since they allow free choice of the unit  . 
5.1 Temporal nouns
A temporal noun denotes a set ; of intervals . We define the granularity of a temporal noun formally as a pair of numbers specifying them in i -real and maximal duration of its intervals  ( e . g . 
or ' an ( day ) = (1 . , 1), gT ( t,/~ . ( conference ) = (1, 28), or a'n(senfinar ) = (0 . 00138889, 334 . 812) if " the unit is adw ) . The following relation is used to compare granularity values  . 
(15) ( d , tr~ , durl ) > d'ur ' ~ , dur ~) + ~ dur ' ~ , d ' ur ~) 7~ <& , r  ~ , dur ~> A dur I >> dur ~ If 7t   1 has coarser grmmlarity than rt2  , then an interval of rt : l cannot be included in aD  . interval of ' ~7, 2 .

Nouns functionally dependent on calendarmea-Sln'e l/ouns inherit the property  ( e . g . Monda 35 Christlna S , holida : B6:45, . . . ) . Event and state nouns have the disjointness property  , if the described intervals fimctiol mlly depend on one of the particil  ) ants and the pm'ticil ) all t is definite . 
Thus , example (18) is & wiant.

\] if ~ zl has finer granularity than a noml ~ z ~ which has the property of disjointness  , then every interval in r ~ , loverlaps with at most one interval in n2 ( we disregard the case where il joins two intervals in  n2  )  .

Among the temporal relational nouns we distinguish nouns describing periods of definite length  ( e . g . quarter , t ; hird , hall ) f ' ronl those that refer to periods of indefinite length  ( e . g . beginning , middle , end) . 
In grmmlarity calculation , relational nouns contribute a factor . With relational nouns referring 11; o~- .

(24) ~ m:May(rr ~) AVw:week(w ) AwCrn , ~ e : visit ( e , John , Jane ) A eCmA eC_wS in ce temporal quantification requires that a narrow-scope iterative adverbial be included in the wide-scope adverbial  , configurations are excluded whereby conceptual knowledge the narrow-scope adverbialal cannot be included in the wide-scope adverbial  a2  . By theorem (16) this is the case if a , i has coarser granularity than a 2 . 
6.3 Granularity and Scope
We have now seen two nlotivations for the principle  ( 25 )  . 
(25) If ~ , ~ has finer granularity than r~2 and rt , 2 is iteratively quantified ,  ~ , 1 camot have scope over ~ t2 . 
Let us now consider the t bllowing t ) rinciple: ( 26 ) If 7/'1 has finer granulm ' ity than 7~ , ,) and r~ , lisiteratiw flyquantified , ~ zlcmmot have scope over ? ~ , 2 . 
We are not in a position to tbrmally explain the principle  . It , holds for at least all nouns with the disjointness property  . Although in example ( 27 a ) the vq reading would make perfect sense ( Jones is always on holiday )  , it is excluded . 
In contrast , example (27b ) allows this reading ( . Jones shuttles between conference sites ) . The principle is not restricted to temporal grmmlar-ity:In  ( 27 c ) the V~reading is excluded , too . 
(27) a . Every Monday , Jones was hereina month in which he was on holiday  . 
b . Every afternoon , Jones gave a talk at a conference . 
c . On every page , 1% und something interesting in a paper I read . 
Taken together , the two principles assert that the grmmlarity ranking determines the scope order  . In the dismnbiguation algorithm presented in section  7 we are mainly interested in the position of the highest  ( iterative ) quantifier . So if every pair of time adverbials can be compared in terms of granularity  , we have a procedure to compute this position . Comparison of granularity (1 . 5 ) is not defined if the granularity values overlap or m ' e equal  . Equal granularity is only possible with specific time adverbials  . 
(28 ) ? John came from every Wednesday to every weekend Other heuristics will have to come into play in case of overlapping ranularity  ( see section 8 for further discussion )  . 
6.4 Deictic Adverbials
Another factor for determining scope order is deixis  . Some adverbials ~ tre connected in their interpretation to the time of speedl  ( now , at the moment , next week , last week ) . Since time of speech is deictic ( it depends on the context of utterance )  , hence defilfite , every function on it will also be definite . Deictic adverbials always get wide-scope position . 
Sentences in which deixis conflicts with granularity m'edeviant  . 
(29) ? Next month , I will be here every year.
7 The Disambiguation Algorithm
In the implementation , an underspecified se-nlant ; ie representation formalism is used to encode the source analysis and the transfe result for the target  ( the Verbmobil Interface Term ( FIT ) formalism ( Bosel ; al . , 1998) , which is based on the theory of Underspecified Discourse Representation Structures  ( Ileyle ,  1995)) . The disambiguation heuristics of the system completely rely on local context  . The most important features in local context are source tense  , the predicate names of the tensed verb in source mid target  , and the time adverbials in odifying the verb in source and target  ( Sdfiehlen ,  1998) . 
In a first step , the source and target representations are converted into an abstract representation  , using the VIT transfer for lnalism ( Dorna and Emele ,  1996) . All information irrelevant to tense resolution is removed  . Since no fullfledged tense logic is implemented , information about temporal reference is discarded as well  . 
Temporal adverbs are decomposed into prepositional phrases  ( e . g .   . yesterday-+ on a past , extracted : (30) a . multiple classification of verb senses ? stative or dynamic  ( for English only , cf . section 3 . 2 )  ? 1 ) oten tially pertbrmative/self-coln mentary or not ( for English only , cf . section 3 . 2) ?" immune " or not ( cf . section 2 . 2) b . temporal relation expressed by preI ) o-sitions e . temt ) or alorientation of pret ) ositions ( on Monday )  , adjectives ( the previ-ous Monda : v ) and determiners ( this

3 . Let STA be the set ; of all specitic time adverbials in 5/'A(i . e . adverbials denoting a specific interval ) not in the scope of a quantificational adverbial or frequency adverb  ( cf . section 2 . 3) . 
4. Perfector Not ? ( cf . section 4)
If one of the time adverbials in ETA is connected to the tensed verb overal in fitative relation  , choose perfect ; else choose non-t)erf'ective tense . 
5. Present or Future ? ( cf . section 2)
Choose present if the verb is " immune " to temi ) or alorientation ( cf . section 2 . 2) . Elseunify the temporal orientation contributed by the time adverbials in ETA  . In case the result excludes presentime , choose fltture ; else choose present ( cf . section 2 . 1) . 
6 . Simple or Progressive Aspect ? ( of . section 3 )   ( a ) If the tensed verb has a stative sense , choose simple ( State Present ) . 
( b ) If the tensed verb is used in a self-commentary or perfonnatively  , choose simple ( Ilxstantaneous Present ) . 
( c ) If there is an adverbial ill STA , choose progressive ( Temporary Habit and Du-rational Present )  . 
( d ) If there is a quantification ald verbial or flequency adverb in TA  , choose simple ( Permmmnt Habit ) . 
( e ) Else choose progressive ( Durational

1,1 93 . 6% of the cases a specific wide-scope time adverbial could be determined with gramflarity constraints  . In 4 . 7% of the cases several time adverbials of equal granularity had wide scope  . 
A good deal of these cases were alignment errors with the translations  ( e . g . iibel " morgen-the day after tomorrow ) . Other cases were due to the lack of a treatment for coordination  ( e . g . 
on Monday aud on Thmw day or ti'om June to August ) . Some cases were genuine double descriptions of days :  ( 31 ) a . Is it possible for you tomorrow on the second ? b  . I would have time on Wednesd w on
Wednesday the third of May.
In 1 . 7% of the eases the wide-scope adverbial could not be determined because some a  . dver-bials had overlapping ralmlarity values . Here the main culprit was the unspecified adverb when  ( see ( 32 a ) ) . Other cases were due to incorrect preposition attachment  ( see ( 321 , )) .

After a discussion of the factors involved , particular emphasis was placed on an account of scope resolution among time adverbials  . It has been shown that grmmhu'ity calculations go along way towards the goal of full scope resolu -tioii  . The cross-commotions between granularity and scope have been analysed in detail  , and some motivation for these connections has been given  . 
One area of future work is to apply the model to larger corpora and extend it to cover the full set of tenses  . If translations can be aligned with the training data  , it would be interesting to investigate the extent to which the model can be used to extract  ( parts of ) the pertinent granularity information on temporal nouns from the corpus  ( Schiehlen ,  1998) . For example , the occurrence of a configuration like ( 33 ) could be interpreted as evidence t br NOUN having coarser granularity than week  .
