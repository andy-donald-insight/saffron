The original version of this paper is very detailed  . Space limitations for publication in COLING's proceedings have forced us to reduce it by a factor of five  . The more detailed version has been proposed for publication in ' ~ inguistics "  . 
This paper is an attempt to present the computer models and linguistic strategies used in the current version of the Russian-French translation system developed at GETA  , within the framework of several other applications which are developed in a parallel way  , using the same computer system . This computer system , called ARIANE-78 , offers to linguists not trained in programming an interactive environment  , together with specialized metalanguages in which they write linguistic data and procedures  ( essentially , dictionaries and grammars ) used to build translation systems . In ARIANE-78 , translation of a text occurs in six steps : morphological analysis  , multilevel analysis , lexical transfer , structural transfer , syntactic generation , morphological generation . To each such step corresponds a computer model ( nondeterministic finite-state string to tree transducer  , tree to tree transducer ,  . . . ) , a metalanguage , a compiler and execution programs . The units of translation are not sentences , but rather one or several paragraphs , so that the context usable , for instance to resolve an a-phores , is larger than in other second-generation systems . 
As ARIANE-78 is independent of any particular application , we begin by presenting its main features in Part I  . Some of them are standard in second-generation systems  , while others are original . Among these , we insist on the multilingual aspect of the system  , which is quite unique , on the very powerful control structures embodied in the supported computer models  ( nondeterminism , parallelism , heuristic programming ) , and on its interactive database aspect . 
In the second and larger part , we successively describe each step of this Russian-French application  . We first present the underlying computer model ( there are 4 of them , as the second , third and fourth step use the same one ) , then the organization of the linguistic data . A small text is used throughout the text as a standard example  . Examples of translations of larger texts appear at the end  . 
I-Current GETA translation system
The computer system ARIANE-78 , together with appropriate linguistic data , constitutes a multilingual automatized translation system  . 
The system is a rather sophisticated second generation system  . It relies on classical as well as more original principles  . 
I . C ! assical second-generation principles
Intermediate structures
The process of translation of a text from a " source " language in a " target " language is split up into three main logical steps  , as illustrated below : analysis , t ~ a ~ fer and generation . The output of the analysis is a " structural descriptor " of the input text  , which is transformed in an equivalent structural des-criptor in the target language by the transfer phase  . This target structural descriptor is then transformed into the output text by the generation phase  . Essential in our concePtion is the fact that analysis is performed independently of the target language  ( s )  . The " deeper " the analysis , the shorter the distance between the two structural descriptors  . Ideally , one could imagine a " pivotal " level , at which they would be the same . 
In the past , Pr . Vauquois'te amtried a slightly less ambitious possibility \[ Vauquois  ,  1975\] , namely to use an " hybrid " ( Shaumjan ) pivot language , where the lexical units are taken from a natural language  , so that the transfer phase is reduced to a lexical transfer  , without any structural change . As it is not always possible , or even desirable , to reach this very abstract level , one may choose not to go all the way up the mountain and to stop somewhere in the middle  . This is why we call our structural descriptors " i ~ termediate structures "  . 
Note that ARIANE-78 imposes nothing of that kind , both extremes are still possible , and in fact the linguistic teams have agreed on " multilevel " intermediate structures which contain very deep as well as low level types of information  , ranging from logical relations to traces ( see details below )  . 
SeParation of programs and linguistic data The second classical principle is to offer metalanguages  , in order to keep the particular linguistic data ( grammars , dictionaries ) separated from the programs . 

For instance , dictionary lookup is a standard function , which should not be modified in any way when a new language is introduced in the System  . This separation also corresponds to a division of work and enhances transparency : dictionary lookup may be optimized by the programmers without the linguistic user severbeing aware of it  . The same goes for more complex functions , like pattern-matching in tree manipulating systems  . In these metalanguages , linguists work directly with familiar concepts , like grammatical variables , classes , dictionaries and grammars . The grammar rules are rules of Some formal model ( contextfree , context sensitive , transduction rules ) . That is , one may also consider such metalanguages as very high level algorithmic languages offering complex data types and associated operators  . Although this principle of separation has been criticized as imposing too much " rigidity " on the users  , cri-tics have failed to understand that this is only the case when the metalanguages are not a dequa ~  . 
A good comparison may be found in classical programming  , where for example , the compiler and runtime package of PL/I is separated from programs written PL/I in exactly the same sense  . 
Semantics b ~ features
The third classical principle touchessema ~ . In a second-generation MT systems , semantics may be only expressed by the use of features  ( concrete , abstract , countable ,  . . . ), which are exactly like grammatical features . The theoretical framework is the one of a formal language  , with a syntax describing the combination rules of the language units  . There is no direct way , for instance , to relate two lexical units . In order for this to be possible , there should be a ( formalized ) domain , possibly represented as a thesaurus , and rules of interpretation . However , this limitation may be partially overcome in ARIANE-78's lexical transfer step . Remark also that semantic features may be extremely refined for some limited universe  , and give surprisingly good results \[ TAUM-METEO , J 975\] . 
2. Principles p.ro per_to GETA's sy?tem
We relate them to the three main principles exposed above  . 
Intermediate structures
In ARIANE-78 , we split up each of the three main phases into two steps  . This is essentially for algorithmic as well as for linguistic reasons  , Morphological analysis , lexic ~ transfer and morphological generation are undoub-tedly very much simpler than the order steps  , and it has seemed reasonable and linguistically motivated to keep them separate and to use simpler algorithmic models to realize them  . 
However , this could not be the case in other environments , for example if the input would be very noisy ( or a linput )  . 
A RIANE-78 uses a unique kind of data structure to represent the unit of translation from morphological analysis to morphological generation  , namely a complex labeled tree structure : each node of such a tree bears a value for each of the "grammatical variables " used in the current step  . 
GETA's system is mu~ngual by design : an analysis cannot explicitly use information from the target language  , and generation is likewise independent of the source language  . 
Moreover , in a given user space ,   ARIANE-78 ensures the coherence of the linguistic data written to construct a multilingual application  . 
Computer environment
The principle of separation of programs and linguistic data is strictly observed in our system  . An additional feature is to propose several algorithmic models designed to be of maximal adequacy and generality as well as of minimal computational complexity  . 
Functions of an integrated MT system include preparation of the linguistic data  , management of the corpora and execution of the linguistic data over texts  .   ARIANE-78 provides a conver6atio~al environment for these functions , hiding implementation chores to the user . It also includes aspe ~ a Zize data-base management system for the texts and the linguistic files  . 

Semantic features may be declared as normal grammatical features in each step  . At lexical transfer , the linguist may relate several source and target lexical units  , these relations being elaborated in the succeeding structural transfer phase  . This is however certainly not sufficient to call the system " third generation "  . 
3. Organization of the translation process
Overall schema
The schema below shows the different steps of the translation process  . The components of ARIANE-78 implementing the 4 different algorithmic models appear within circles  , they are lin-ked by double lines to rectangles corresponding to the linguistic data written in the associated metalanguage for the indicated step  . Simple arrows indicate the flow of control . 
Organization of a step
In each step , the linguistic data may be of four kinds : grammatical  va~u6ables   ( like gender , number , semantic type ) , classes , describing useful combinations of values of variables  , d/ct / 0 nar/es and grammars , containing the rules and the strategy to use them .

They are expressed in a metalanguage.
Their syntax and cohenrency is first checked by the corresponding compiler  , which generates a compact intermediate code . At runtime , this code is interpreted by standard " execution programs "  . This approach separates the linguistic and algorithmic problems  , and makes debugging and maintenance much easier . 
The complete system is operational on IBM compatible machines under VM/CMS  . ARIANE is the name of the interactive monitor interfacing with the user  .

II-Anapplication to Russian-French translation We will use a small size text as our standard example  . Note that usual translation units are not sentences  , but rather paragraphs . We use an unambiguous lat in transcription .

I . Morphological analysis
The grammar , classes and dictionaries are written in the ATEF formalism\[l  ,  8 , IO ,  19\] . 
The strategy of the analyzer has been described in  \[16\]  . Its output is a " flat tree " with standard structure and with leaves labelled by the masks of variables computed by the analyzer  .

In order to build a whole transformational system  , the linguist write s~n6fo ~ UJ ~ O~r ~ ( TR ) and groups them in transformation a ~ gr ~ mars ( TG )  . When a TG is applied to an object tree , all compatible occurrences of its TR are executed in parallel  . 
The overall flow of control is described in the control graph  . Using a builtin backtracking algorithm , ROBRA finds the first possible tra-versal of the control graph leading to an exit  ( & NUL symbol )  , thereby applying each traversed
TG to the object tree.
Rules are grouped in grammars when they correspond to related linguistic phenomena  , or when they express transformations used for a certain logical step of the linguistic process  ( here , multilevel analysis ) or , more strategically , when they share the same execution modes ( e . g . , iterative rules will appear in " exhaustive " grammars  , others in " unitary'grammars . 
This architecture makes it possible to limit the interaction between rules and avoid many combinatorial problems  , to develop strategies and heuristics , and to test and modify TGs separa-tely ( different trace parameters may be associated to each TG  )  . 
Let us now give the control graph used in multilevel analysis of Russian  , with some comments .

are used.
GNI builds simple nominal groups like Adj + N or
Prep+Normum+N .
G N2 looks for further elements in the nominal groups , and solves certain ambiguities . 
RLT looks for the nominal antecedents of relative and participial clauses constructed by  ENON2  . 
SN searches for a personal verb as main element of the utterance  , and for verbal modifiers , like negative and conditional particles or auxiliaries  . 
S N2 tries to solve the adverb-short form adjective ambiguity and builds embedded nominal groups  . 
MARQ builds all types of subordinate verbal and infi-nitive clauses  . It further tries to solve the previous ambiguity . 
AMB searches for the most important terms of the clause  ( subject , object , near dative ) , thereby resolving ambiguities between subject and object  , adjectives and adverbs , etc . 
NALF treats nonalphabetical forms as appositions or verbal complements  . 
CASC handles all genitive imbrications , by ( provi-sionally ) attaching dominated groups to non-ambiguous groups  . 
PHR marks all strongly governed groups subordinated to the utterance with logical relations as agent  , patient , attribute . . . If possible , this is also done on dependent groups . 
CIRC and GEm4 realize the distribution of prepositional and genitive nominal groups between their noun heads  , according to several syntactic and semantic criteria  . 
ELID searches for antecedents of pronominal expressions and isolated adjectives  , and builds noun groups by copying the lexical unit of the antecedent  . If the elliptic element is not a personal pronoun  , it becomes qualifier or determiner according to its syntactic class  . The syntactic and logical functions of the new group are computed  . 
SUBCORD is purely tactical ( modification of the hierarchy of certain subordinate clauses  . 
FTR copies certain information from nonterminals onto terminal " head " nodes  , to prepare for lexical transfer . 

We give now the result of the multilevel analysis of our standard example  . Note that node 5 ( noun group with head node 6"PRINCIP " ) has correctly been given syntactic function subject and logical relation patient  ( A2 )  . Syntactic functions of nonterminals appear as auxiliary lexical units  ( UL )  .

G(F ), N(S)--441~3 . Lexical transfer Lexical transfer is written in TRANSF  . It essentially includes a bilingual multichoice dictionary of " transfer rules " accessed by the UL  . Each rule is a sequence of 3-uples ( condition , image subtree , assignments ) , the last condition being empty ( true ) . 
The automaton traverses the input in preorder , creating the object tree as follows . The UL of the current node is used to access the dictionary  . The first triplet of the item whose condition is verified is chosen  . The image subtree ( generally consisting of only one node ) is added to the output , with values of variables computed by the assignment part  . 
Hence , the output tree is very similar to the input tree  . The possibility to transform one input node into an output subtree may be used to create compound words or to create auxiliary nodes used in the following step  ( structural transfer ) to treat idioms . 
As this model is algorithmically very simple , it is the only one where no trace is provided . The example below gives an idea of the metalanguage of the dictionary  .

The following gives the control graph of the TS written for this step in the current version of our translation system  . 
PRL handles idioms , predicted in lexical transfer by generating auxiliary subtrees  . It checks whether predicted idioms are present and takes appropriate action  . 
RECOP copies certain information ( required mode , type of adjective , postponed preposition inversion of arguments ) from terminal " head " nodes onto their fathers . 
RCTF handles nonstandard government , particular uses of " DE " , erases some prepositions , takes care of passive-active transformations , etc . 
EFFACerases remaining auxiliary nodes generated in TL  ( idioms , nonstandard prepositions ) . 
ACTL handles particular idiom translations , like " ESLI + Inf "~" SION + Present " , etc . 
QUALD handles actualization and qualifiers ( modes , tenses , determination . . . ) , and generates the correct order in nominal groups . 
ART uses the remaining designators to compute the determination of nominal groups  . 
DERV handles derivations (- ANT , -EUR , -ITE , etc . ), negation ( NON , PEU , IN . . . ), prefixes and others . 
DTM makes the final computation of determination of noun groups  . 
As we see , structural transfer is relatively simple in this version  . However , many improvments are planned in our future version  . 
The result of this step is given below.
Note the modification of order in the last nominal group  , as well as the generation of the impersonal " ON " .

Syntactic ~ generation ROBRA is also used in this step as algorithmic component  . The aim of this step is to produce a tree structure where the terminal nodes contain all the information necessary for generating the output text  , and to give the final surface order of the words . This is a cons-traint imposed by the nature of the algorithmic component SYGMOR  , used in the last step .

Some facilities must be provided by the algorithmic component  , SYGMOR to handle elisions and contractions . 
SYGMOR realizes the composition of two transducers : the first  , " tree-to-string " , produces the frontier of the object tree ; the second transforms this string ( of masks of variables ) into a string of characters , under the control of the linguistic data . These data are made of declaration of variables , formats and condition procedures , dictionaries ( with direct addressing by the values of certain declared variables  , whereby the first dictionary must be referenced by the 
UL , and a grammar.
Each item in a dictionary gives a list of < condition/assignment/string > triplets  , the last one having an empty ( true ) condition .

TPi A , PS SPT , TP3A are names of condition procedures , VID , V3H , V3A are names of formats . 
The apostrophs ( ' AI ) are used in the grammar to make contractions . 
It should be noted that , unlike ATEF,
SYGMOR realizes a finite-state deterministic automaton  , thus reflecting the lesser complexity of the synthesis process  . To process a mask , SYGMOR looks for the first applicable rule ( at least one must have an empty condition )  , applies it and follows the transitions indicated , unless it finds an inapplicable obligatory rule . In this case , the system executes the special rule ERREUR or a default action if this rule has not been declared  . It is thus possible to generate an arbitrary error string at that point  . For instance , nontranslated source lexical units will be printed between special markers  . 
The output of SYGMOR on our standard example is the following text  , which is then transformed by ARIANE in a script file and formatted  , thereby adding documentary information .
