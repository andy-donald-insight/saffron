The system is being elaborated at the Laboratory of Mathematical Linguistics at the Institute of Mathematics with Computer Center of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences  . 
The desorlbed system requires :
I . A form ~ description of the syntax of basic nuclear structures of the naturallan Euage sentences which has to be used during the process of syntactical analysis of the users " phrases in a natural language ~  2  . Techniques for representing in the computer the knowledge about a given problem area  . The obtained descript-ion has to be used during the process of semantical analysis of the users " phrases in a natural language !  3  . A dictionary containing the terms used in the chosan problem area  . The dictionary is compiled by specialists in the given problem area  ;   4e A dictionary containing the el-vice vocabulary ( independent of a particular problem area ) -word-groups as " less than " , " geater than " , " equal to " , " slid " , " or " , " as . . . 
ash etc.
5 . A basic software system-a database management -   222 -system ( for example , a relational DBMS ) , or a program package ( for example , BMDP-biomedical data processing ) . These ready software products service users of - a given problem area and they usually have their own language for describing and processing the data  . 
The considered system is viewed as a superst ructure over the given software system and i tperforms :  1  . Translation from a language close to the natur ~ alone into the internal softwares ys tem's language for description or process ing the data  ;  2 . An effort to analyse the correctness of the user's request in terms of the given problem area description and messages when d is covering mistakes !  3  . When ambiguities happen a dialogue is carr ied out in order to make the user's request unambiguous  . 
4 . ~ rocessing the results from the basics of tw are sys-tem and final shaping of the messages in the context of the user's request  . 
Such a system is called a linguistic processor ( or linguistic preprocessor ) and is considered as a dynamic system which can be generated over various problem areas and various basic software systems  . 
By " a natural fan . age as a tool for the man-computer dialogue " in this paper we mean the following :- a fixed list of appropriate natural language phrases is not a seigned ~- restrictions are not imposed on the ~ rammatical structures of the sentences the manenters into the computer !- man has to interact with the computer in a correct natural language  .

The describe approach for creatin ~ linguis tic processors can be qualified as a semantic-syntactic alone since semant-ica lanalysis in terms of the given problem area description has a leading role in the process of " understanding " of the input phrase in a natural language  , while syntactical analysis has an auxil iary role  . The structural description of the prob ~ lemare a is a network designed for the representation of the problem are a semantics and is viewed as a static  , in moblle and determinative tool for " unders t and ing " and accomplishing the dialogue  . The syntactical analysis does not presume a full scanning of the input sentence  . It involves analysis of synt-actical dependences at different levels with respect to the problem are a complexity and  , naturally , to the input phrase complexity . By means of an elaboration of the formal descr ipt-ion of Bulgarian syntax  , an improvement of the techniques for syntact i calanalysis is envisaged  . 
When workir ~ out the principles of construc tion of linguistic processors  , some peculiarities of the Bulgarian lan ~age have been taken into account  , namely , its flexion a ~ character , the absence of a case system , free word-order , etc . 
The approach proposed for the realization of the man-computer dialogue in a natural language allows to process problem areas with different complexity  . Linguistics process - ors at two levels are be in ~ elaborated at the Laboratory of Mathematical Linguistics-for access of users-nonprogr~mn -ereto a relational database in Bulgarian l ~ ags and for access of users-nonprogrammere to the facilities for stat-Istloal analysis proposed by the program package \] ~ DI  )
