Abstract
(~ene:x'ic terms cam be divided into two refercnbi : Qly different groups  . Generic term oi " l , h ~: ~': i ~' s t group is a name ( or a definited csc . ci . p tion ) of the corresponding class of Objg > ( ; i ; : ~( of ? J~~: . i ~ Uars in South America ~ i ~' f . e ~ j ~ ! . ! ~ ci . ; The whaIe is a mammal ) . 
i ! ~ fo:-g~t\] . er :\[ c terms of the second group , wep , : ' oposei ; otreat them as genera \] , terms ( in ~ hc sense o ? ' Wo Oo Quine ) . " - they are considered-to be ~' eferentia lly incomplete expressions ~  , ~ hiub . ~" when constituting the th-eme of age- , nez-i ~: p , : , opus : i , tton , undergo quantification which : i . sexp : t'esse(J ~ explicit\] , yor implicit-\[! . y ~ inside the verb phrase ?\] . oI ra-trodlotion
One of the mosl , important aspects of langu~gecomp ~- ehension is comprehension of ~  . -efe_~ence- , -: L~e ~ of a corresponden-ce ) etwez ~ ~ ~ Je ~ itence ( and some of its consbi-friends ) and reality , which is brought about by the speaker in the speech act  . As is usual for a logical approach to language , all types of reference , with the exception of concrete reference , are reduced to quan-tification of different kinds  , and quantifi-cation can be defined ~ with a sufficient de-g:L  . ee of prec : ision , by stating truth conditi-onsfox ' sentences with the corresponding quantifie r ? ~ eanwhile generic expressions  ( jl . t\]:)a tctJ . ou\] . ar~gene'rio terms ) constitute a puzzle for a theory of refe rence  , for any i ) z , oposed formulation of truth conditions for . ~ Jentm : l . ces with generic terms is easily refuted by contradicting examples  . Thus , an attempt to reduce referential meaning of the g  ( me : cic in definite article in English to ' th ~vl ~ of the quantifier adjective  ( m~de in Jespersen 1927 ) can be demonstra-ted to be futile ; in fact , statement ( la ) , for exaunple , is usually considered to be true , while ( lb ) is definitely false ( thougjl and all are synonyms ) :  ( 1 ) a . Norve ~ cyvy sokogorosta wegians are tall'norve ~ cyvysokogo ' E or b  . Vserosta ' A 1   1 tall ' nor we ~ i ans are An attempt to capture referential aspects of the meaning of a generic term with the help of a " quantifier of majority "  ( Parsons 1970 ) or a quantifier ' usually'raay be , perhaps , successful for sentence ( la ) , which is approximately synonymous to sentence ( 2 ) :  ( 2 ) Norve ~ cyoby ~ no ~ ysokogorosta ' Norw egians are usually tall ~ but the idea of majority has nothing to do with the meaning of such sentences as  ( 3 ) Kit-mlekopitaju ~ ee ' The whale is am~al ' ( indeed , (3) ~(3')* A whale is . usually a mammal ) ; or with the meaning of sentence ( 4 ) A tom so stoitizj adraielek tronov'Atom consists of the nucleus and electrons '  . 
A suggestion was made to the effect that generic terms do not refer to entities of the realworld at all  . Thus , according to Wierzbicka 1980 , in such sentences as ( 1 ) tallness is attributed not to an or wegian ( i . e . not to a real person ) , but to our image of a nor wegian . However , this claim , even if it is true , cannot be true for all species of generic expressions  . Poronething , generic terms can occur in the context of identity sentences  , cf . 
(5 ) Deti-~to budu ~ ieljudl ' Children are mento be '  . 
And what is identity ' if not identity of reference ?  501 From a formal point of view , what characterizes generic noun phrases ~ at least in languages without articles  , such as Russian , is the fact that they do not comprise any determiners or quantifier adjectives  , not only in the explicite but in the implicite form as well  . In other words , generic ~ Psevade referential characterizat ion : no words explicite l ~ expressing them ode of reference of a noun phrase  ( cf . Pa~du ~ eva\] . 985) can occur within a ge~leric NP ; more over , no words can be added to a generic NP to ~ ake clear its referential meaning or meanings  , as is obvious from examples (1)-(5) . The analysis which follows aims at providing generic l ~ Ps with such an interpreta-tion of their referential import that would match this formal characterization  . Our direct aim is to provide an analysis for gene -ric NPs of hussian  , but many of the problems discussed are semantic in nature and thus language independent  . 
2 . Generic phrases denoting situations Generic use is co~m ~ zon not only for noun phrases de not ing objects  , like those in(J)-~(5) , but also for noun phrases with proposi-tional meaning  , cfo ( 6 ) Cvetenijer ~ iv segd an apomi-na et ~ muena ~alovojny'F \] owering of rye always reminds me of the begining of the war '  . 
(7 ) Ubijstvootvratitel'no'Assass ination is a bomin-able '  . 
.ioreover , generic uses are possible also for predicative denominations of situations :  ( 8 ) It often happens that a young manoveres timates his resources  . 
(9 ) Operation is always dangerous when the pat i ent is more than  70  . 
( lO ) Kedines always in a hurry ? ( ll ) She usually got frightened when hebrough ther flowers  . 
(12 ) Ryba ~ niets golovy ' Afishrots beginning with its head '  . 
(13) John beats his wife in the yard.
Study of generic reference is usually confined to one particular class of generic  5O2 terms ~ to those denoting objects ? What we claim is that at least in this case broaden ~ ing the object of investigation will not compl icate the whole picture  ; just the oppo-~site , it may contribute to its clarification ?3 . Gener : \[ csasagrs ~ nmatical problem Generic use is a problem not only fo:creferential semantics but also for a de ~  , scriptive gra~rm ~ ar of a language ? To mention just two points ? a  ) In the context of a generic NP grar ~ ,  . -matical Number ( i . e . the opposition of S in . , , gular vs . Plural ) cannot retain its usual meaning . I lowever , on the one hand , the choice of ~ umber in generic NPs is not ri -gidly regulated ~ i  . e . synonymous variation of Number is possible , cfo(14) a , Lo 5 ad'-um noje ~ yvot noje ' A horse is a clever animal '? b  . Lo ~ adi ~ - , m~uyje~yvo~nyje '11 or ses are clever animals ' ? On the other hand  , Singular and Plural in generic , N~s-a ~ ce not-Tz~el ~" i:n-be-rcl ~ angeable thus  , it is impossible to say ( 15 ) U hasv dome zavels'atarakan ( Sg ) in the meaning ' There are cockroaches in our house '  , if only in the context of a " lan & axage game " , and it is absolutely impos- . 
sible to use sentence ( 16 ) ~Glazu ~ tojrybyime et formugru ~ ( Pl ) in order to convey the meaning ' The eye of this fish has the shape of a p ~ ar ' o There is a strong feeling that the choice of grsm~-matica l Number in generic NPs is dependent upon their referential properties  ; in other words , it seems that different classes of generic NPs can be delimitated with differ ~ ent requirements as for the choice of Nma ~ bet  . 
b ) Another grammatical problem connected with generic expressions  , concerns the choirs ce of Tense and Aspect of the verb in a ge~neric proposition  . In Lyons 1978 it is suggested that generic propositions lie out of the scope of the Tense opposition  ( ice , that they are omn item poral ) . Lyons claims that this thesis is not disproved by such examp ~ les as  ( 17 ) Dinosaurs were peaceful animals , because Past Tense in such sentences corresponds only-to the fact that dinosaurs are extinct and not to the fact that they have stopped being peaceful  , as would be the case if Past Tense had been used here in its usu-almeaning oStill for such sentence as  ( 18 ) Dinosaurs died out ( became extinct ) it would be absurd to maintain that it is omai temporal : in  (  \ ]  . 8) Past Tense has its most com ~, ~ on meaning ? 4 . . Generic term and generic proposi t ion
The main conclusion that can be drawn from the existing literature on generics  ( c fo a substantial review in Carlson 1978 ) is that generic expessions are heterogeneous ( W ~ that in Russian even less information can be got from the gra~mgatical form of a generic term than in English  , because of the lack of ~ rt . lcles ) o Thus the line of analysis Which we follow in this study consists in making a series of del imitations that would divl degeneric expressions into sew  . ~ rald if ~ ferent groups so that each statement would apply only to that group of generic expressions : for which it : L strne  . 
~' ir s\[o ?' all , it J . snecessary to sepaz , a-te generic NPs when used in ' the context of ag eneric proposition  ( or generic statement ) from their occurrences in all othe L " contexts . We propose the following definition : A propos ition is called generic if a generic noun phrase G constitutes its not \[ on a  1 theme ( topic )  , i . e . 
if this proposition is about GoThus , in ( 19 ) proposition is generic : ( 19 ) Professiona 1 mathe-matician will read the book by M  . Atj a with pleasure . 
o\[ndeed ,   ( 19 ) is a statement about professional mathematic ians ? Neanwhile  ,   ( 20 ) is not a generic statement - ~ ( 20 ) The book by NoAtja will be of inte ~ res-\[t for profession a  1 mathematicians . 
In fact ,   ( 20 ) is not about mathematicians  #its them8 is a concrete individualized ob~ject ~ a book by ~ oAtjao Generic NPs constituting the subject of a generic proposition are more readi \]  . ysub-~itted to semantic analysis , for in this con~-text referential import of genericity can be represented  , at least in someoon texts ~ a ~ a kind . of quantification . Indeed , if a generic NP is a subject of a proposition , then the quantifier which bounds this NP has maximum scope ~ its scope is the whole sentence  . And if so then the referencial import of this quantifier  , and hence of the generic NP , can be revealed by means of truth conditions of the sentence as a whoie o Otherwise  , ice . in cases where the generic ~ iP does not constitute ~ he subject of the pro ~ position  , it is altogether unclear , what proposition constitutes the scope of ~ he supposed " generic quantifier " ~ Thus  , for sentences in ( 21 ) logical representation is a puzzle ( 21 ) a .

Generic NPs as names of classes
In some contexts generic terms can be successful ly treated as names  ( or descrip ~ tions ) of the corresponding clans . ~ k ~ r example , generic terms used as subjects of pre-~dicates which are meaningless unless when predicated to classes  (  . as to beair ~ mr ! jal ; to be come extinct in examples (3) and (18)) , are best represented as names of classes ( in English such'generic terms can only be mark ~- ed by a definite article ~ in Russian they have no special distinctive features  )  , Cfo ( 22 ) Nekogdajaguarbylz'aspros~ra~henpc vsemuzer auomu ~ aru ' Soi ~ etime ago the jag uar was spread all over the world '?

Thus ~ for " typical " generic propositions , such as (1) , two properties are substantial : l ) they a:e equantified implicitely ;  2 ) their quantification belongs to the semantic type gusually ~!  . ruth conditions for a typical generic proposit ion can be formulated as follows  ( 26 ) A ~ eneric proposition with the subjects and the predicate P is  t1~e if and only if for any xC-~Es ( where Es is the extension of the general'term s  ) it is usua11 y the case that P ( s ) is true ? The meaning of usually \[ can be descr ibed in the sa ~ eway as the meaning of other words is described in lexical semantics  . 
Thus , sj !_s usuall ~~' ~ or most xEEs it is true that l ~  ( x )  , and this situation is con-sidered to be natural ' ? This definition gives an explan at ion to the following examp-lef ~' om Carls on  1978: sentence Books are usual l ~ ) aj ! erbacks sound sodd , though it is , perhaps , true that most books are now paper-basks ? The fact is  , that this situation is not as yet considered to be natural  . 
7 o Adverbial quantificalion
In a similar way truth conditions for other types of adverbial quantification in generic p ~ opositions can be stated  . What is important is the fact that there are contexts in ~ hich adverbial quantification cannot be reduced to quantification over the extension of the subject term  . 
Take ex~np\]e ( 27 ) Young people usually overestimate their resourse so ~\[ ts meaning cannot be adequately represented by means of quantification over the set of all young people :  ( 27 ) ~' Most young people overest imale their resourses '  . What is ment in ( 27 ) is that for most cases when a young man estimates his  ( or her ) resourses heover estimates them . 
So it is clear that quantification over si -tuations and not over objects is involved here  . In the same way we can represent the meaning of sentences  ( 8 )  -  ( 13 ) with generic names of situations from section 2  . 
8. Grammatical problems revisited
Referential oppositions that were introduced al low us to give explanations to at least some of grmnmatical phenomena connected with generics  , ~lich were mentioned in section 3 . 
Thus , ,  ( 28 a ) and ( 28 b ) are not strictly synonymous : ( 28 ) a . Amerikanec ( Sg ) de lov it ' An american is effective ' . 
b , . Amerikancy ( P1 ) delovity ' J ~ ericans are efficient ' The dif ference in meaning may be ascribed to the fact that  ( 285 ) is a usual type of gene-ric propositions ~ ile ( 28 a ) describes our mental image of an American ( in the sense of
Wierzbicka 1980).
Exceptional behavior of generic terms with respect to Tense  , exemplified by (18) , can be explained by the fact that sentence ( 18 ) does not express a generic proposition : NP dinos aurs is here used as a name of class  . Genuine generic propositions are , in fact , o ~ mi temporal . 
9. Conclusion
Our investigation can be looked upon as a proof of the thesis that for typical gene-ric noun phrases a logico-semantic interpre-tation can be given which strictly corresponds to their surface structure  ( in artic-le-lacking languages ) : generic terms can be treated as referentially incomplete phrases  , with qu~ntification expressed outside the phrase itself or not expressed at all  .
