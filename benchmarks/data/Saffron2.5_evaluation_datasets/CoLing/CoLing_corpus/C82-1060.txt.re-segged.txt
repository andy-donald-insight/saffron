In the analysis of Mandarin , the author used a corpus composed of over 750 , 0 00 samples transcribed automatically from Chinese characters by the computer through the sequential application of a set of phonetic rules developed by the author  . The result is a classification and rank distribution of all speech sounds  , the phonetic properties , frequency distribution of symbols , phonemes , syllables , tones , and their combinations . These statistical properties are compared with those of the English language  . 

English is widely used throughout the world while Mandarin is spoken in China by one quarter of the world's population  . It is interesting to compare the phonetic properties of these two languages and to study their similarities and differences to understand the problems involved when the speakers of one language learn to speak the other language  . 
The linguistic aspects of written English and Chinese  , such as those presented below , have already been studied extensively ( see Suen ( 1979 a & b ) ) , e . g . a ) the frequency of occurrence of words / characters  , b ) the statistical distribution of letters/radicals , and their combinations , c ) the study of syntax , semantics , pragmatics , and related areas , and d ) translation of one language into another . Also the linguistics aspects of spoken English have been described in wellknown literature  ( Dewey ( 1923 )  , Carterette et al (1974)) , e . g . a ) the frequency of occurrence of syllables , b ) the statistical distribution of phonemes and their combinations  , c ) the phonetic system and symbolic representation of sounds  , and d ) a-coustical analysis , recognition and synthesis of the spoken language . 
Such investigations , however , have been rarely conducte ~'" on Mandarin , the official language spoken in China , owing to many reasons . In order to close this gap , the author has initiated several research projects aimed specifically at the analysis of these aspects  ( Suen ( 1979b ) ) . 
PROPERTIES OF MANDARIN
Mandarin sounds consist of consonants , vowels , semivowels and diphthongs . A Mandarin syllable comprises 1 to 3 such constituents , the first symbol is usually a consonant . The syllabic structure of Mandarin is shown below  . A key to the phonetic symbols used in this paper can be found in Suen  ( 1979b )  . 
Syllabic Structure Example i . Vowel/A/2 . Diphthong/EI/3 . Triphthong/IA U/4 . Vowel ? Nasal/AN/5 . Diphthong ? Nasal/IANG/6 . Consonant ? Vowel/BO /7 . Consonant+Diphthong/PA U/8 . Consonant+Triphthong/MIA U/9 . Consonant + Vowel ? Nasal/RUN/10 . Consonant+Diphthong+Nasal/LIANG/Assoc iated with each Mandarin syllable is at one which gives the musical quality  . It is normally denoted by a diacritical mark as shown below  . At one specifies the pitch contour of the syl lable  . 
There are five tones in Mandarin and they can be described as follows  ( Suen ( 1979b ) ) :
Tone DescriDtion Pitchi . -- high level 5 52 . / highrising 353 . vlowrising 2144 . ~ high falling to low 515 . ? neutral 5For example , the syllable/WOV / , meaning " I " in English , has a low rising tone . Since there are only about 400 different syllables in the whole Mandarin language  , the tone is crucial insignifying the mean ing of words  . This property of Mandarin is distinct from the 
English sounds.
COMPUTATION ALANALY SISO FDATA
In computational linguistics , it is essential to have a large collec-tion of data in order to derive reliable results  . The help of a COMPUTATIONAL ANALYSISO FMANDARIN SOUNDS  373 computer is indispensable . In this study , computational analysis of a corpus composed of more than  750  , 000 samples of Mandarin syllables was made . More details . can be found in Suen (1979b ) . Owing to the limitation of space here , this paper only compares the frequency distr ibution of Mandarin and English phonemes  . The distribution of English sounds was derived from a study conducted by Carterette and Jones  ( 1974 )  . Their phonemic frequencies were obtained from a transcription of  15  , 694 words spoken by 24 subjects . 
REMARKSON MANDARIN/ENGLISH SOUNDS
From Tables 1 and 2 , one can make the following observations : ( a ) Mandarin consonants occur 8% less frequently than English consonants ( b ) Semivowels are used twice more often in Mandarin than in 
English ( c ) Vowels occur more frequently in Mandarin than in English  ( d ) Chinese speakers used diphthongs more often than English speakers  ( e ) Mandarint ones are not evenly distributed and the  4th tone occurs much more frequently than the others ( f ) Although both English and Mandarin have approximately  40 phonemes , many Mandarin phonemes do not occur in the English language  , especially the retroflex and dental sibilant sounds  , and the round-lipped vowel ~ which occur rather frequently  ( about 12% ) in Mandarin conversations ( g ) There is considerable difference in the distr ibution of Mandarin and English diphones  , triphones , etc . which affect significant-ly the formation of syllables in these two languages  ( h ) Considerable difference also occurs between the syllabic structures of English and Mandarin  ( i ) There are many more sound patterns in English ( about one distinct sound for one word ) than in Mandarin ( only about 1160 distinct sounds in the entire language ) Implications of the above on the learning of Mandarin by English speakers will be discussed  . Their effects on computer synthesis and recognition of Mandarin speech will also be presented  . If time permits , the author wishes to present his new phonetic system which will enable an English speaker to pronounce Mandarin sounds correctly and easily  . Encouraging results of applying this new system in the learning situation will be discussed  .
