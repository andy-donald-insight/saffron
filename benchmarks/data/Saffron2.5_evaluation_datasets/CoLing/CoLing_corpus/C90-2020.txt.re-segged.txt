The KAI , II'SOS prototype we have developed at the IBM Paris Scientific Center is able to analyze texts written in l  ; reneh and to produce a semantic representalion f these texts expressed as a set of interrelated Conceptual Graphs  \[6  ,  1\] . It uses a semantic lexicon which contains , for each word to be defined , one or more Conceptual Graphs corresponding to one or more meanings of the word  . 
The KAI , IPSOS quest km/ans we fing system analyzes a Natural l  . anguage query , translates it into Conceptual Graphs , performs pattern matching and deduction on these text graphs to select the answer  , and finally generates a Natural I angmage answer fiom the selected answer graphs  . 
We do not detail this KA1JI'SOS system here because many papers have already been published on it  ( see the references )  . We have chosen to present recent work \[5\] which has been done on building a large concept hierarchy from an existing published ictionary  . More precisely , we have synthesized a large semantic network by selecting hYtx ' xonyna definitions from th  . c"l ) ictionnaire du vocabulaires scntiel-\[ , es 5000 roots fond a men-taux"(G . Mator (: , Iarousse , Paris 1963 ) and coding them as a set of Prolog clauses awtilable for the KAI  , IPS ( ) S system . 
Concept type hierarchy and hyperonymy
First , we must remind you how the conceptype hierarchy is the necessary basis for any use of the Conceptual Graph model  . The reader may of course refer to \[6\] . In the Conceptual Graph model , the conceptypes are not supposed to be words but abstract symbols  ( atoms ) used to denote a concept . Ia ' or example , we could have COMMU-NICATION-I~I1OCESS as the concept type that occurs in the definition of the verbs " to say "  , " to communicate " , " to discuss " , etc . In the same way , a polysemic word like % at " should point on distinct graphs containing STICK and ANIMAl  , as primitive conceptypes . It appears that the conceptype hierarchy must also contain chains like: 
EI , I ; , PlIANT < MAMMAl , < ANIMAl , <
I , IVING-III?ING < F , NTITY define the patiern matching algorithms on Conceptual Graphs which are used to build a graph from a Natural Language sentence by joining the Conceptual Graphs of its parts  . It is also necessary 1o encode and to verify the preference semantics constraints in the semantic lexicon  . The concept hierarchy is the basis for the join and projection algorithms  \[3  ,   6\] which provide a way to disam-bignate the Natural l ~ anguage complex sentences and to perform query /answering on Conceptual 

In the present work , we consider that concept types may genera Uybe identified to word senses  . 
Thus , the word " bat " poinls on concept types BAT . 1 and BAT . 2 and BAT . 1 < STICK , BAT . 2 < ANIMAI , is stored in the hierarchy ( STICK and ANIMAL being the conceptypes associated to the main meanings of the words " stick " and " animal "  )  . This implies that the synthesis of a large conceptype hierarchy is related to the seleclion of correct hyperonyms  . We give here the logical interpretation of the hyperonymy relation between the words with meanings wl and  w2  , derived from the one given in \[4\]: wI is hyperonym of w2 ill ' , for every sentence Strue \[ S ( w2 ) \]~ true\[S ( w2/wl ) \] where : S ( w ) stands for a sentence containing an occurrence of w  , S ( w2/wl ) stands R ) r the sentence S ( w2 ) in which the occurrence of w2 is replaced by w1 . 
is the usual logical implication.
l : or example , ANIMAl , is hyperonym of I ) OG because all assertions about a particular dog remain true when we substitute " the animal " for " the clog "  . 
Of course , this criter km is not " always verified in a such formal way  . It is only a guideline . 
In a Natural Language dictionary , the Natural I , an ? guage definitions may be classified hl to a typology  , as in \[4\] . For example , all the definitions of the form NP VP may be hyperonym definitions  , as in : l'elephant':a very large animal with two tusks and a trunk with which  . . . 
But NP VP definitions may also be metade f -nitions  , as in : ' be get ': old use to become the father o for  , as an example in l:rench:'~tre':motqui ddnote la  facult6 d'exister . 
In this paper , we have tried to translate the definitions into English to make it easier to read  , but our French dictionary (5 , 00 (1 entries ) uses simpler definitions than thel , ongman dictionary . This is the reason why the reader will nut find a perfect match when referring to the Ixmgman  . Furthermore , this work depends on the particular dictionary ( Mator 6 l . ~ mmsse ) we adopted but the important fact is that the result we have built is coherent and con'ect  . 
The method
The method was mainly empMcal : it was not so clear that the information contained in the dictionary would be useful for synthesizing a large and coherent concept hierarchy  . We will return to this important point later . But we must add that the building of a large concept hierarchy from natural langmat  , e definitions has limits . For example , it cannot be a simple hierarchy but a hierarchy in which the links are labeled by conceptual relations like part of  , set-of , etc . Another limit is that tile theoretical transitivity of the hyperonymy relation can only be verified on a chain of word senses if the chain is not too long  . It should be noted that we were particularly interested in the top part of the hierarchy  , i . e . in the list of the basic concepts from whicla all the others may be derived  . The method , a bottom-up one , was carried out in tile following stages : 1 . The hyperonymy definitions were selected from the dictionary  ( by hand )  . 
2 . The meanings of the words , in the entries and in the definitions , were distinguished by introducing a coherent subscript notation for the current word and the main noun of its deft-ni fion  ( by hand )  . 
3 . The relation between the current meaning of the word and its hyperonym were encoded as al'ro log clause  ( by hand )  . 
4 . Ixmps were suppressed by the application of Prolog consistency checking programs that introduced an additional syuonymous relation between concepts  . We mean here that when wl < w2 and w2 < wl are found , we declare as al'ro log clause that SYNONYM(wl , w2) . 
5 . t'ro log programs were applied to the result in order to display it in a suitable way  ( see appen-dices A and B )  , and to have associative access to this data from Prolog  . 
There is a difference between simple hypemnym definitions and compound hyperonym definitions  . 
A simple hyperonym definition has the syntactic pattern N+VP  . . . , or N+RF , I , ATIVF ,- CI , AUSE . . . In this case we choose N as the hyperonym of the current word  , if it is a correct hyperonym . A compound hypemnym deft-nition has the syntactic pattern : 
NP VP . . . , where NP has the form : 1 . NAI ), IL ; CTIVI ~ : 2 . NPRF , PDN(I'I ~ , EPI ) stands for ' de '' du' , ' de la ') 3 . Absence deN(absence of N ) 4 . Manque de N ( lack of N ) 5 . Action tie V ( action of V ) 6 . I ~ a Ssult at de N ( resull of N ) 7 . Ensemble deN(set of N ) 8 . Masse deN(mass ofN ) 9 . Groupe de N(group of N ) 10 . R & n fion de N(u rlion of N ) i1 . Fair de V ( fact consisting in V ) 12 . Fawm de V ( way of V ) 13 . Mani~rede V(maturer of V ) 14 . Possibilit 6 de V(possibility of V ) 15 . l ~ , talde N ( state of N ) 16 . Art de V (, art of V ) 17 . Quantitd de N ( quantity of N ) 18 . l , istedeN(list of N ) 19 . Suite deN(sequence of N ) 20 . Pattie de N(part of N ) 21 . Morceau de N , pi ~ ' , ce de N ( piece of N ) 22 . UNITE . IdeN ( unit . l of N ) 23 . l ) ivision de N ( division of N ) 24 . Element de N ( element of N ) . 
In all these cases , we keep the informalion contained in the NP and we code it into Prolog as follows : ? Case  1: we include the adjective in the frst hyperonym and we derive a secondary hyperonym  , h ) rexample:
F , lephant : A large animal . . . .
1;, I , F , PIIANT < I , ARGE-ANIMAI , <
ANIMAl , ? Case 2: we keep the compound noun a stile first hyperonym and we generate its secomlaWhy peronym  , for example : l ) oute : Et at d ' esprit . . . .
( Doubt : Stale of mind . . . ) t)OUTE . I < I ~, TAT-I ) F , - I ~ , SPRIT . 2 < IiTAT 21 13 . lcudi : Jour de lase maine . . . 
( Wenesday : day of the week . . . )  . lli~\[J\]l ) I < JOUR . 2-I)E-SEMAINE <
JOUR . 2 ? Cases 3 to 24: we consider that the relation is a primitive conceptual relation which label stile hyperonymy link in the concept hierarchy  , for example : lnfanterie : ensemble detroupes . . . 
( Infantry : set of troops ...)
INFANTERIE <
ENSEMBI , E-I)E(TROUI ~ E.I)<

Tiffs last case implies that the result is more than a simple hierarchy : from a form M point of view it is a semantic network because of the use of primitive relations ACT-OF  , PART-OI; , SETOF etc . 
The result shows that there are 57 main hierarchies . 
We give the corresponding table containing the top concepts and the number of sons they have  . In all , more than 3 , 6 00 word meanings have been coded into the network . Please see Table 1 Before the

This rest flt is not homogenous : some hierarchies contain many nodes and tile others a few nodes  . 
We can consider that : ? Some hierarchies correspond to fundamental types : -- Etre  ( being ) -Chose ( thing ) - Fait ( fact ) -Action ( action ) -Substance ( substance ) - Quantit 6 ( quantity ) - Mani ~ re ( manner ) - l ; orce ( strength ) -Son ( sound ) - Feu ( fire ) Other hierarchies correspond to logical types : - Motif  ( motive ) -Cons 6 quence ( consequence ) -Fonction . 2  ( function ) - Lien ( link ) -Manque ( lack ) -Absence ( absence ) -El6ment ( element ) - Nombre ( number ) -degr 6 ( degree ) 
Other hierarchies correspond concepts : to topological-Borne  ( boundary ) -Bordure ( edge ) -Direction ( direction ) -Dimension ( dimension ) -Espace ( space ) -Intervalle ( interval ) -Contenu ( content ) - Volume ( volume ) ? The remaining hierarchies correspond to other isolated types and contain fewer concepts than the preceding ones  . They are also pertinent but it is surprising to obtain some of them as basic genetic on cepts  . 
Another remark must be made on tile transitivity of the '<' hyperonymy relation  . It appears that in a chain wl < w2 < . . . < wn , it is possible to consider that each relation wi < wi +  1 is justified . 
Nevertheless , it is more difficult to justify wl < wn . For example , consider the chain:
TOMBE < FOSSE < TROU < OUVER-
TURE . 2 < PASSAGE . 2 < LIEU < PAR-"1"II~, . I ( ESPACE ) grave < pit < hole < opening < passage < location < part-of  ( space )   ( we give tiffs translation , but it is very difficult to keep the exact nuances of the French chain  )  . 
In this chain , each contiguous relation is justified , but to justify tile link between ' grave ' and part-of  ( space ) requires specifying the point of view that is taken  . In fact , we have reached the limits of the process of building a concept hierarchy from existing dictionaries  . 
Appendix A contains an extract of the hyperonym dictionary we obtained  ( for the meanings of words beginning with G ) and Appendix B contains an extract of the hierarchy whose top concept is 
CIIOSE(thing).
