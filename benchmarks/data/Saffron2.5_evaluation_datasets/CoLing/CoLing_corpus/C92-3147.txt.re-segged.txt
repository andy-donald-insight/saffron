1. Introduction
The key to good reasoning is a powerful representation system that is able to accuratcly model details of a problem  . Once a good represent . at , on has been established , problem computations often become straightforward . 
I?~ecent advances in situation theory \[ BP 83 , B ax89\] and the theory of intentions \[ Bra87\] have offered ninny new insights on significant problems found in natural language understanding  . However , these the-aries offer philosophical approaches only  , and do not give instructions for building concrete reprcsentation and reasoning engines  . 
At the same time , the software systems that have been built for reasoning and representation fall short in any ruunber of areas  . Production systems and semantic networks can follow chains of inferences  , but can only represent one possible world at at ime they cannot reason with states that are both possibly true and possibly not true  , while keeping the chains of resulting inferences eparatc  . Most plasl-nets work with limited possible worlds  , but call not reason and perform inferences across multiple worlds at the salne time  . The classical ATMS 1 call represent and reason with multiple timeless possible worlds  , but calmot represent actions \ [ dK86\]-in particular , nonmonotonic actions where a retracted state is both believed ' to be truc in the world be forettte action takes place  , and believed to be not true in the world representing the situation after the retracting action has taken place  , cam to t be represented . In addition , the ATMS only represents propositions that are in -stant's teal constants or Skolem constants  ; it does not represent uninstantiated variables . A modified ATMS that can represent nonmonotonic transitions between worlds has been developed \ [   MN86\]  , but this system does not explicitly represent situation types and instances  , action events , nor nondeterminism . Most plan inference systems have ignored free will and the  1Aanumption-13tmed Truth Maintenta * ce Systen l\[ dK86\] explicit representation f the right to choose actions  , e . g . to choose to heun cooperative . Almost all prcvi-ous systems lave ignored the nondetermimstie quality of realworld actions that aecess it at cs commit-meatill intentions  . Real actions call result in one of several possible out comc situations  , where , xsal-olost all previousy stems are are completely unable to model u on d c terminls tie outcomes  . Only dccision-analysis systems have modeled cxpected w dues of actions  , alnlthey do not support inferencing . See\[BL85\]fi ) ran excellent summary of issues . 
Tile B-SURI ~ ( Believed Situation and Uncertain-action Representation Environment  ) packag c is an implemented system that supports representation  , phmnmg , decision making , and , plan recognition using probabilistic , and uncertain actions with nondetcr ministic outcomes in multiple possibl caction worlds  . Situations , states , and action events , axe all represented explicitly , using types ( w triables ) and instances . The B-SURE syst cmisiml ) lemented as a series of extensions to a classical ATMS  . The resulting system is very useful , and is being used in plan recognition , intentional agent , and scheduling research . 
2. Situation Theory
In \[ BP83\] , situations are divided into the categories abstract and real  , and also into the categories " states of affairs " alid " courses of events "  . Abstract situations denote situations that are mental representations  . All the situations discussed in this paper are " abstract situations "  . Reals it nations denote situations as they actually are in the real world  . Since it basically never makes sense to talk about real situations in tile computer  , there is no need to snpply these in a representation evironment  . " States of affairs " correspond to situations that axe static  , called simply situations in this paper . " Courses of events " correspond to situations that describe actions that are being executed  , called action events or actions in this paper . Barwise and Perry also make use of " relations " defined over '* individuals " and " space-time locations "  . This paper takes as primitive the expression of a relation  , which will be termed a stats . The user is freetomention individuals or space -time locations in state descriptions as desired  . State descriptions may be represented nsing logical forms  , feature structures , or other methods ~ sineeth contents of states are not used by B-SURE except for output  , it does not matter . States , situations , and actions axe assigned one of the belief values definitely believed tzate  , possibly believed true , not believed true , believed not true , not believed , otherwise known msactua / , possible , by potheticed . .

~. Intentional Action Theory
One model of intention states that an intention is a choice to perform an action  , plus a commitment to obtaining its desired outcome\[CL87\]  . With deterministic action outcomes , there is no real need for endeav-oring \[ Brag 7\] , since once the action has been started , it is guaranteed to finish properly . Many planners in fact operate in this " fire and forget " mode  . However , once it is acknowledged that action execution is in fact nondeterministic and can have undesirable outcomes  , the need for endeavoring becomes clear . The planner must predic the likelihood of possible outcomes happening  , and judge which action sequence offers the best chances  . It must interactively maintain a history of past endeavors and results  , and modify its future behavior based on current outcomes  . Acting intentionally become significantly more interesting and realistic with the explicit representation f possible chains of nondeterministications  . 
4. Previous Efforts
DeKleer\[dK86\] presents the first ATMS . Morris and Nado \ [ MN86\] present an ATMS that can represent nonmonotonic transitions  , but do not handle probabilities , uncertainties , explicit situation types , state types , nor action events . Tile research of Allen ( e . g . 
\[AK83 , A1187\]) , who uses a predicate-calculus representation , offers some of the best multiple-worlds ( deterministic ) action representation it his field . 
Charniak and Goldman \ [ CG89\] use probabilities and Bayesian nets to represcnt he truth value of probabilistic statements and attack story understanding  . 
Although nondetcr ministic-out comcactions are not represented  , and Bayesian ets cannot support global inferencing with nonnronotonic actions  , their work is important . Norvig and Wilensky\[ NW90\] comment on problems of probabilistic statements .   "1'he most similar work is recent research by Rao and Georgeff  ( e . g . \[RG gl\]) , who use a modal logic instead of an ATMS to represent nondeterministications  . 
5 . B-SURE Entities & Implementation The underlying ATMS works with nodes  , assnmp-tions , and implications ( justifications ) . See\[dK86\] . 
A slate consists of a proposition about the world.
States are primitives . A situation is a set of positive and negative ( withdrawn ) states . An action event represents he state that " execution of the action has started "  . States , situations , and actions have types and instances . See figure 1 .   ( The abridged representation of figure 1 is shown in figure 2  . ) Existance of an instance in a world always implies existance of its type  . A chooses node is an assumption associated with an action instance that represents whether an agent chooses to execute that action or not  . The chooses assumption together with the starting situation instance imply the action instance  . Since an agentypically can only execute one action in a given situation  , the situation ' sensuing chooses assumptions are rendered mutually exclusive  ( pairwise " no good " )  . 
Action types have precondition situation types . Action instances are instantiated from types by first verifying that the precondition situation type is believed true in that world  . Action instances transition from a starting situation instance to ouc of a number of known nondeterministic outcome situation instances  . 
Actions have transitions . A transition has an out-con , esituation and a probability or an uncertainty . 
An uncerlaiuty is defined as a probability random variable of range  I0  ,   1\] together with an associated second-order probability distrilmtion  . Uncertainties are initialized using maximum -entropy theory  , and get updated as outcome observations are taken  , to enable the system to learn and estimate possible probabilities  . See Section 6 . Uncertainties are used to represent confidence in likelihood values and to make decisions regarding information-gathering activity  . The calculus of uncertainties is too complex to explore further here  , and is not required for understanding tile mum capabilities of the representation  ; probabilities are sufficient . Transitions can be types or instances . 
ACRESDECOLING-92, NANIT ~ . 2328 AOt ~ rr 1992962 PROC . OFCOL1NG-92, NANTES , AUO .  2328 .   1992 A transition instance is defined as a happens mssump-tion  . An action instance , together with a happens assumption , iul ply the corresponding outcome situation instance  . Typically only one outcome situation can occur from a giveu action instance  , so the action's happens assun-ptions are nlade mutually exclusive  . A situation type is implied by its state types . When an outcome situation instance is i astantiated  , all of its new positive states are instantiated and all of its ohl negative states are retracted  . A positive nonperma-nent state instance is implied by a nol-relracled-yel assumption  . The outcome situation instance remembers these . Situation and action instances store an explicit environment history of all added state  , chooses , and happens assumptions that are currently believed true in that possible world's time linc  . A negative state is retracted by making the situation instance and the state's"not -rctrasted yet "  , assumption mutually inconsistent , and deleting the state's assumption from the outcome situation's environment history  . A state type or instance or situation type's belief value in a particular world is found by testing that node against a situation instance's environment history  . 
Situation types and instances can have values . Actions can have costs . The expected value of an action is determined by summing the transition probabilities times the expected values of the outcome situations  , when known , and subtracting its cost . Tim expected value of a nonvalued situation instance is determined by maximizing the expected values of the possible subsequent actions  , when known . In this manner , decision theory determines the course of action with the maximum expected value at anyone situation  , for a planning agent . This can bcused to predict the probable next course of action of a planning agent by an observing agent performing plan recognition  ( actually , " decision recognition ")\[ Mye91\] . 
6. Probability Estimation
The probability of an outcome situation i occurring following performance of an uncertain action is estimated using the new estimator ~ instead of ~  , where m is the total number of previously observed trials of that action type  , k ~ is the previously observed number of ith situation-type outcomes  , and n is the number of known possible outcome situations from that action  . The new estimator is optimal . It represents the center of mass of all possible probabilities  , instead of the maximum-likelihood mode ; it converges faster and on average is more accurate than the old estimator  ; and , it can be used accurately with small sample numbers and small snccess counts\[  Mye92\]  . 
7. Maintaining an Interactive History
One important advantage of the B-SURE system is that not only can it be used for hypothetical reasoning about future events  , but the same structures can then be used as a history mechanism for interastively monitoring and representing the history of the actual events as they occur  . A user system should start out in a known situation  , which is presumed actual . 
Typically , the user system will use B-SUrtE to explore many different nondeteeministic-action sequences and make decisions ~ s to which actions are tile best ones to perform  . The system will then start executing the first action mtile chosen sequence  . At . this point , tile user system should instruct tile B-SUItE system to presume the chooses assumption associated with tile chosen action being executed  , which will change its truth value from " possibly believed true " to " deli-nitely believed true "  . If the chooses node has already been made inconsistent with other chooses nodes  ( because the user-system or agent could ouly perform one action at a time  )  , those other nodes are automatically rendered " believed not-true " at this point  . The presumption of the chooses node renders the associated implied Action Event instantiation " definitely believed true " at this point  ,   , also . This represent she fact that the action has sta ted and is currently being execnted  . 
When the action finishes , it is necessary for the B-SURE system to realize which outcome occurred  . 
This is typically performed by the system setting up are cognition demon that is attached to a separate state or situation type that  , when true , reliably indicates that a given outcome has occurred  . When the demonfires , it presumes the outeome's happens assumption . 
It is important to ensure ttl at one and only one recognition demonfires  . Alternatively , tile user can control presuming the happens nodes directly  . When a single happens assumption is presumed , it automatically renders its sibling happens assumptions " de ~ initely believed not  ; -tzale" . 
The combination of tile happens node being presumed and the action event node already being believed true renders the appropriater sulting situation instance believed true  . Note that if any instance becomes true , so does its associated type node as well . 
At anyone point in tinm , the states , situations , and action event instances that have happened in the world already are believed true  ; and the situations and events that have not happened yet but could happen are believed possible  . In this way , the system maintains a time hne history of the situations and action events that have in fact occurred  , while allowing hypothetical panning and exploration of possible future events in the same data structure  . 
It is not necessary for the system to maintain only a single timeline history  . It is possible to maintain disjoint histories , to represent e . g . progress made by different processing agents , progress made in different domains , or progress made at different hierarchical levels of abstraction  . It is possible to maintain forking ( nondisjoint ) histories if this makes sense , and timmutual exclusion options have been turned off  ( see
Section 10).
Counterfaetuals The system maintains the structures of past possibilities that did not happen  . 
Although these are not believed true , it is possible for the user to explore these structures and perform reasoning on what could have occurred had certain actions been chosen or certain nondeterministic outcomes happened  , by supplying an extra counier fac-tual assumption to justify the desired action or sit-ACRESDE  COLING-92  , NANTEs , 2328 ^ o13"r1992963 Paoc .

It is even possible to add to these structures , if necessary . This can be used to explicitly represent newly -received p~st connter factual iu-formation  ( e . g . , " If you had applied for the conference last June  , the cost would have been 35 , 000 yen " ) and the associated reasoning derived from snch assertions  . 
Such reasoning has traditionally been very difficult to represent  , because of the negative truth values . 
8. Decision Inference Example
A researcher is calling a conference office from t be tramstation and wants to get to the conference on time  . He has a choice between asking for taxi directions  , or requesting the office to send a shuttle-bus out directly to give himaride  . The shuttle will take him directly to the conference on time  . If he requests and the office turns him down , he has a choice between taking a taxi , and taking the regular bus . 
These cost ditferent amounts of money and have different chances of getting to the conference on time  . 
See figure 3 . The plan inference system must predict which paths of information he will explore  , i . e . 
what he will say next ; and then which decision she will make for his actions  . This is done using " decision inf crence " , by understanding which action trees offer the best expected value based on the value and chances of outcomes  . Note that the shuttle-bus , the taxi , and the regular bus will all three allow the researcher to possibly obtain his desired goal  , but there are definite preferences . The system should not remain uncommitted . See\[Mye91\] for more details . 
9. Intentional Communication Example
A recent analysis of 12 actual interpreted telephone conversations revealed that  31% of the utterances were spent in requests for confirmation and repetitions of information such as telephone numbers  , name spellings , and addresses , that were not completely understood the first time\[  OCP90\]  . This means that the traditional plan-recognition model of assuming that the hearer automatically understands the semantic content of the speaker's utterance is fallacious  . The speaker , and the system too , must consider the case in which the hearer does not understand an utterance  . Since the speaker wants and intends to communicate specific information  2  , the speaker will endeavor to ensure that the information is communicated  , by repeating an utterance when it is not understood  . 
Thus , speaking an utterance is a nondeterministie ac - Lion  ; it , is unclear whether the hearer will uuders taald or not  . Intentional utterauce acts are therefore modeled ~ nondeterministic-outcome actions by B-SURE  . 
l ) if i ' erent courses of the conversation cat \] be represente depending upon the outcomes of the utterance acts  . See Figure 4 . 
10. Process Scheduling Example
The application of the BEHOLDEIL alimited -resource parallels ehednling system to translation systems is being researched  . A hypothetical model system is used for testing . The system will accept an input caadidate from a speech recognition module  , and attempt to quickly transfer tim result directly to output  . If required , a morphologic danalyzer will derive multiple possible analyses candidates for each input candidate  . A pattern marcher will then recursively apply a body of patterns to each analysis candidate  . 
Each pattern has a series of transfer-driven translation templates  ; each template has a series of prototyp-i cai exmnple bindings  . The highest-ranking structure of matching nested patterns and their bindings are sent to a template marcher  . The distances between the pattern bindings and the template xamples for each pattern in the structure are compared using a thesaurus  . The template with the closest match for each pattern will be used to assemble a translation  . 
It is the responsibility of the BEHOLDER system to schedule this activity in an opportunistic fashion on multiple processors  . There is no need to continue to explore a branch if a good translation has been found  . 
The BEHOLDER system must use value-of-information theory and decision theory to determine which process branches to explore next and when to stop  . 
The BEIIOLDER schedule ruses the B-SURE system to keep track of which processes are running and which have been executed  . Using this representation , it can plan a head and decide how useful it is to expand a particular path of execution  . As processes are started , the chooses nodes are presumed . Figure 5 shows a simulated run where the direct transfer , the morphological nalysis , one pattern match , and one template match have been run . The template match has examined two examples so far  . 
Since in this ease more than one a ~ tion can be executed at a time  , and one action caule gally have more than one possible outcome  , it was necessary to modify the n-SORE system to allow local disabling of the  2Note that people do not always decide to intend to endeavor to do everything that they weatt  .
