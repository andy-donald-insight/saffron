It can also occur on its own , with anaphoric ordeictic reference . Asahioka , Hirakawa , and Amano ( 1990 ) identify seven different patterns of use . In order to concentrate on the translation of classifiers and number  , we will restrict our discussion to noun phrases of the type ' XC-no-N ' and not discuss the problems of resolving anaphoric reference and floating quantifiers  . 
Semantically , each classifier relates to a class of nouns ( Kuno ,  1973 ,  25) , often fairly arbitrarily . For example-hiki ' ( small ) animal ' is used to count small animals excluding rabbits  , which are counted with-wa'bird ' . There is a default classifier-tsu'piece' which can be used to count almost anything  . 
2.2 English ' Classifiers '
In English , numerals can directly modify countable nouns ' X N '  . In order to enumerate uncountable nouns , either the uncountable nouns have to be reclassified as countable nouns  , or embedded in a partitive construction : two beers or two cans of beer ' XN ' or ' XC of N '   ( Quirk et al ,  1985 ,  249) . This partitive construction is similar to the Japanese quantifying construction ' XC-no-N '  . 
Quirk et al (1985 ,  249-51 ) divide partitive nouns into three main categories QUALITY PAR-TITIVES  , QUANTITY PARTITIVES , and MEASURE PARTITIVES . QUANTITYPARTITIVES are further divided into three cases  , the first where the embedded noun phrase is uncountable  , the second where it is plural , and the third where it is singular and countable . All the partitive nouns themselves are fully countable  . 
QUANTITYPARTITIVES where the embedded noun phrase is headed by an uncountable noun  , the first case , are then divided into GENERAL PAR-TITIVES such as piece which serve only to quantify and TYPICAL PARTITIVES such as grain which are more descriptive  . 
2There are some examples of words that can be either a common noun or josftshi : for example  gy5 ' line ' or hako'box ' , which can follow a numeral or standalone . These nouns can be handled in two ways : ( a ) as a lexical class that combines the properties of common nouns and josftshi  , or ( b ) as two separate lexical entities . ALT-J/E follows option ( b) , such nouns are entered into the lexicon twice , once as a common oun and once as a jos ~ ishi . 
3 A B i l ingua l Ana lys i s o f c lass i f ie rs As there is no direct fit between English and Japanese  , it is necessary to categorize the Japanese and English classifiers and to define rules which will enable effective machine translation  . 
We divide classifiers into four major types : IIN\ ] T  ( Section 3 . 1), METRIC ( Section 3 . 2), GROUP ( Section 3 . 3) and SPECIES ( Section 3 . 4) . The main criteria for the analysis are the restrictions placed  , in English , on the countability and number of the embedded noun phrase in a partitive construction  . Whether a noun is a classifier , and if so which type , is marked in the lexicon for each
Japanese/English noun pair.
We distinguish between five major different noun countability preferences  , based on the analysis of Allan (1980) , adapted for use in machine translation by Bond , Ogura , and lkehara (1994) . 
' Fully countable ' nouns , such as knife , have both singular and plural forms , and cannot be used with determiner such as much . ' Uncountable ' nouns , such as furniture , have no plural form , and can be used with much . Between these two extremes are nouns such as cake  , which can be used in both countable and uncountable noun phrases  . 
They have both singular and plural forms , and can also be used with much . We divide such nouns into two groups :' strongly countable '  , those that are more often used to refer to discrete entities  , such as cake , and ' weakly countable ' , those that are more often used to refer to unbounded referents  , such as beer . The fifth major type of countability preference is ' pluraliatanta ': nouns that only have a plural form  , such as scissors . 
3.1 Unit classifiers
UNIT classifiers are the prototypical classifiers.
AUNIT classifier will be realized in Japanese a ~ a josshi  . However , there are three possible translations of a Japanese noun phrase of the form ~ XC-no-N '  , where C is a unit classifier : Individuate : Translate as ' XN'  , where the classifier C is not translated and the numeral directly modifies the countable English noun phrase :  1-hiki-no-inu ' l-piece of dog ' --+ 1 dog . 
Part : Translate as ' XC of N ' , where the classifier is translated by its translation equivalent  ( from the transfer dictionary ) and N is uncountable ( headed by a bare singular noun ) :  1-tsubu-no-kome ' l-grain of rice '-+ 1 ' grain of rice . 
Default : Translate as ' XC of N ' where the classifier is replaced by a default that depends on the embedded noun and N is uncountable  . 
The default is normally piece , but this can be overridden by an explicit entry for N's default classifier in the lexicon : 
Noun Type General Typical Special
Fully Countable
Strongly Countable
Weakly Countable

Pluralia Tanta ( pair )  1  ( log 1 cake 1 hair 1 piece of information 1 pair of scissors 1 dog 1 crumb of cake 1 str and of hair 1 grain of information 1 pair of scissors 1 slice of dog 1 slice of cake 1 slice of hair 1 slice of information 1-tsu-no-kagu ' l-piece of furniture ' - ~ 1 piece of furniture . 
The three types of UNIT classifier are summarized in Table  1  . a Having established three possible translations of the ' XC-no-N'construction  , we can proceed to divide UNH' classifiers into three types  , depending on which of the above alternatives i most suitable  . The first , OI , ' NEIt AL classifiers , are those that have no special meaning of their own  , but are used only to quantify the denotation of a noun  . Typical examples are-tsu ' piece ' and - ko ' piece '  . If N is fully , strongly or weakly countable , then the clas-sifter is not translated ( individuate )  . If N is uncountable , then the classifier is translated as the default ( default )  . The second type of classifer , TYPICAL , consists of those classifiers which are descriptive in their own right  , such as-teki ' drop ' . If N is fully countable , then the classifier will not be translated ( individuate )  , otherwise the classifier is translated ( part ) . The final type of classifier , SPE-CIA l , , is rare : classifiers which force an uncountable interpretation of even countable nouns  , for example-kire's lice ' . N is always parted : 1-kire-no-inu ' l-slice of dog ' -+1 slice of dog . 
The translation of classifiers is complicated by the fact that classifiers and their relationships to nouns are both arbitrary and language dependent  . Consider the Japanese classifier-mai'sheet' , which is used for counting fiat objects . 
This has no direct English equivalent . As a default , it is entered in the dictionary as a GI . ' NEIAL classifier with the translation piece . There are however several fi at , objects for which piece is inappropriate in English : food stuffs  ( slice )  ; paper , glass , cloth and leather ( sheet ) ; bacon ( rasher ) ; and financial contracts ( contract ) . The selection of an appropriate translation is not dependent on this analysis and can be left  , to the normal machine translation process . In ALT-J/E it is done by examining the semantic a tegory of the embed-aIfN's countability preference is pluraliatant a then N will never be individuatcd  . If N is parted or de-faulted there axe two possibilities : either  , if the dictionary entry for N has the default classifier pair then it will be used as the classifier or  , if N has node fault classifier , then a differen translation is searched for in the dictionary and used instead  . If there is no non-pluraliatant a translation equivalent  , hen the translation will defaul to ' XC of N ' as above  , but with N headed by a bare plural noun . 
ded noun . Once an appropriate translation of the classifier has been found  , knowledge of its type allows the system to decide the appropriate form of the final translation  . 
3.2 Metric classifiers
The next overall category is METRI ( ) classifiers : A noull phrase of the form ' XC-no -N '  , where C is a METRI ( ; classifier will be translated as ' XC of N ' , where N will be plural if it is headed by a fully countable or pluraliatant a noun  . We fllr ther subdivide METI/ , IC classifiers depending on whether the resulting English noun phrase will have singular verb agreement  ( MEASURI' ; classifiers ) , or plural verb agreement ( CONTAINF at classifiers ) as its default . 
(4 )   2-kg-no-kami-ha jg bunda '2 kg of paper-TOP enough is '- ~ 2 kg of paper is enough ( 5 )   2-hako-no-kami-ha jubunda '2 box of paper-TOP enough is '-+ 2 boxes of paper " are enough In fact both ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) could be translated with singular or plural verb agreement  . The differentiation into MEASURE and CONTAINER provides a graceful default  . Examples are given in Table 2 . 
3.3 Group classifiers
GROUP classifiers combine with plural or uncountable noun phrases to make a countable noun phrase representing a group or set  . A noun phrase of the form ' XC-no-N ' , where C is a GROUP classifier will be translated as ' XC of N '  , where N will be plural if it is headed by a fully or strongly countable noun or a pluraliatant a  . Noun phrases of the form ' N-no-C' , where C is a GROUP classifier ( but not a jos ~ shi ) will also be translated as ' C of N ' where N will be plural if it is headed by a fully or strongly countable noun or a pluraliatant a  . This allows us to give a uniform treatment of noun phrase such as  ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) during English generation , even though their Japanese structure is very different  . 
(6 )   2-hako-no-pen   '2 box of pen ' 2 boxes of pens ' XC-no-N ' ( 7 ) pen-no-hako'box ofpen'abox of pens'N-no-C  '

For example , in ALT-J/E the countability and number of two at  ) positive noun phrases are made to match each other  , unless one element is plural and the other is a GIOUP classifier  . For example , many insects , a whole swarm, .   .   . as opposed to many insects , beesI think, .   .   . ( Bond , Ogura , and Kawaoka , 1995) . Examples of (; Rein , classifiers are given in Table 3 . 
3.4 Speeies classifiers
The last type of classifier is sP , ,;cn , ;s classifiers . 
SI'ECII : S classifiers are partitives of quality and  (  ; an occur with countable or uneo , lnt & blellOll n phrases . The embedded noun phr~se will agree in number with the head noun phrase iff lflly or strongly countable : a kind of car  , 2 kinds of cars ; a kind of equipment , 2 kinds of equipment . Exaln-ples of SPE ( : mS classifier's are given in Table 3 . 
4 When is a C lass i f ie r a C lass i f ie r ? In the analysis given above for Japanese noun phrases of the form ' XC-no-N '  , we have given no consideration 1 ; othe denotation of N , except for when choosing the at ) propi'iate translation for C . 
Thus we assume that ' XC~no-N'will be translated as ' XC of N ' or just ' XN'ifN is countable  , as in (8) or (9) . 
(8 )   1-pal-no mizu'l-cup of water'--> 1 e?Lp of wate ? f ( CONTAINFI/ . )  ( 9 ) i-tsu-nokoppu'l-piece of cup'--+1C~tp ( GENEI/AI , ) However if N is a noun that denotes an attribute  , such as PRICE or WEIGIIT , then the translation process becomes more complicated  . In the simplest case the noun phrase ' XC-no-N ' should be  . translated as though the classifier ' were a nor -real noun  , giving ' the N of XC' , for examph ' . (10), ( ll ) . 
(10 )   1-pal-no ned an'l-cup of price ' the price of lcv , p ( 11 ) 1-tsu-nonc da'n\[-halOenda\]'l-piece of t ) riee\[-'cop1 ( \]yenis\]'-> the price of 1 ( thing ) f is 10 yen \] In other words , if N has the attribute AMOUNT then the noun phrase should normally be translated as though C were not a classifier  . The interpretation of C is , however , ambiguous . C could be used as a elassiiier with the amount N in its scope  ( 12 )  , or C could have anaphoric reference (13) . ALT-J/E chooses the interpret ~ tion shown in example  ( 13 ) as its defmflt . 
(12) 1-sh'ili-no'n , edan'1 kind of price ' - ~ 1 kind of price ( 13 ) 1-st\]u-none da'n , ' 1 kind of price ' - ~ th . e price of . lkind/of something \] Further , when N is an attribute and C measures the same attribute  , the interpretation is again different . N ) rexainple , if C measures N's attribute then the resulting noun phrase will be indefinite by default : a height of lore or a price of  10 yen . 
I lowever if the noun phrase is used a scriptively then it  ; should be converted ( ; it her to an adjective it is lore high or aprel ) osit ; ionalpin ' as ( ; it is lOyen in price . Finally , if a noun phrase of this type is used to modify at \] other noun then it line  ( is tolm converted to an adjective a . lO re high building or a postmodifying prepositional phrase achocolate  10 yen in price . 
The coml ) in a tio \] ls of nouns and classifiers mentioned above can all be translated by the machine translation syster it ALT-J/E using the analysis of classifiers presented in this paper ill combination with a semantic hierarchy of  2  , 800 categories common to all nouns , as described in Ikehara et al .
