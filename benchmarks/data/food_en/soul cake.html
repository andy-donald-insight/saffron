<p>&#60;blockquote&#62;&#60;poem&#62;
[Chorus]
A soul! a soul! a soul-cake!
Please good Missis, a soul-cake!
An apple, a pear, a plum, or a cherry,
Any good thing to make us all merry.
One for Peter, two for Paul
Three for Him who made us all.</p>
<p>[Verse 1]
God bless the master of this house, 
The misteress also, 
And all the little children 
That round your table grow. 
Likewise young men and maidens, 
Your cattle and your store ; 
And all that dwells within your gates, 
We wish you ten times more.</p>
<p>[Verse 2]
Down into the cellar, 
And see what you can find, 
If the barrels are not empty, 
We hope you will prove kind. 
We hope you will prove kind, 
With your apples and strong beer, 
And we&#39;ll come no more a-souling 
Till this time next year.</p>
<p>[Verse 3]
The lanes are very dirty, 
My shoes are very thin, 
I&#39;ve got a little pocket 
To put a penny in. 
If you haven&#39;t got a penny, 
A ha&#39;penny will do ; 
If you haven&#39;t get a ha&#39;penny, 
It&#39;s God bless you&#60;/poem&#62;&#60;/blockquote&#62;</p> 
<p>In 1963, the American folk group <a href="/Peter%2C_Paul_and_Mary" title="Peter, Paul and Mary">Peter, Paul and Mary</a> recorded this as &#34;A&#39; Soalin&#34;, including all the verses as well as parts of &#34;Hey, Ho, Nobody Home&#34; and &#34;God Rest You Merry, Gentlemen&#34; (which are traditionally associated with Christmas). The musical arrangement (including the accompaniment, chords, and interpolations from the other traditional songs) is quite different from the published 1893 version and was copyrighted&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external autonumber" href="http://www.genekeyes.com/Souling/Souling.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>&#34; The Souling Song [Soul Cake], 2014&#60;/ref&#62; by members of the group.</p>
<p>American <a href="/Hallowe&#39;en" title="Hallowe&#39;en">Hallowe&#39;en</a> composer <a href="/Kristen_Lawrence" title="Kristen Lawrence">Kristen Lawrence</a> found two historical tunes associated with soul cakes as she was researching souling songs for her 2009 <i>A Broom With A View</i> album.  As Lawrence heard the traditional Cheshire tune, she was struck that the beginning notes were the same as the mediaeval <a href="/Plainchant" title="Plainchant">plainchant</a> <a href="/Dies_Irae" title="Dies Irae">Dies Irae</a>, &#34;Day of Judgment&#34;, calling the people to repent and pray for the dead. It seemed plausible that the Cheshire tune could be a folk corruption of the chant as children and beggars asked for cakes in return for praying for the dead.&#60;ref name=&#34;Broom Liner notes&#34;&#62;{{cite book |last=Lawrence |first=Kristen |section=Hallowe&#39;en Carols – Music for the Autumnal Season |year=2009 |title=A Broom With A View |type=CD Booklet |location=Santa Ana |publisher=Vörswell Music}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p> 
<p>The song &#34;Soul Cake&#34; from British rock musician Sting&#39;s 2009 album <i><a href="/If_on_a_Winter&#39;s_Night..." title="If on a Winter&#39;s Night...">If on a Winter&#39;s Night...</a></i> seems to be an adaptation of the Peter, Paul, and Mary version, in that both depart from historical accuracy by referring to Christmas rather than All Saints&#39; Day or All Souls&#39; Day. But the 1893 version of the song already shares lines from similar Christmas carols: &#34;Here We Come A-Wassailing&#34; and &#34;Christmas is A-Coming&#34;.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external autonumber" href="http://www.genekeyes.com/Souling/Souling.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>&#34; The Souling Song [Soul Cake], 2014, with 1893 score.&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
