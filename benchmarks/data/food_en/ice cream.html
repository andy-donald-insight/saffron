It is typically sweetened with <a href="/Sucrose" title="Sucrose">sucrose</a>, <a href="/Corn_syrup" title="Corn syrup">corn syrup</a>, <a href="/Cane_sugar" title="Cane sugar">cane sugar</a>, <a href="/Beet_sugar" title="Beet sugar">beet sugar</a>, and/or other <a href="/Sugar_substitute" title="Sugar substitute">sweeteners</a>. Typically, <a href="/Seasoning" title="Seasoning">flavourings</a> and <a href="/Food_coloring" title="Food coloring">colourings</a> are added in addition to stabilizers. The mixture is stirred to incorporate air spaces and cooled below the freezing point of water to prevent detectable <a href="/Ice_crystal" title="Ice crystal">ice crystals</a> from forming. The result is a smooth, semi-solid foam that is solid at very low temperatures (&#60;35&#38;nbsp;°F / 2&#38;nbsp;°C). It becomes more malleable as its temperature increases.</p>
<p>The meaning of the phrase &#34;ice cream&#34; varies from one country to another.

In some countries, such as the United States, the phrase &#34;ice cream&#34; applies only to a specific variety, and most governments regulate the commercial use of the various terms according to the relative quantities of the main ingredients.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web |url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.idfa.org/news--views/media-kits/ice-cream/ice-cream-labeling/" rel="nofollow">http://www.idfa.org/news--views/media-kits/ice-cream/ice-cream-labeling/</a> |title=Ice Cream Labeling: What Does it all Mean? |accessdate=9 August 2008 |publisher=<a href="/International_Foodservice_Distributors_Association" title="International Foodservice Distributors Association">International Foodservice Distributors Association</a>|archiveurl = <a class="external free" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080514083818/http://www.idfa.org/facts/icmonth/page5.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://web.archive.org/web/20080514083818/http://www.idfa.org/facts/icmonth/page5.cfm</a> |archivedate = 14 May 2008}}&#60;/ref&#62; Products that do not meet the criteria to be called ice cream are labelled &#34;frozen dairy dessert&#34; instead.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/17/dining/remembering-when-breyers-ice-cream-was-you-know-ice-cream.html?_r=0" rel="nofollow">Ice Cream’s Identity Crisis</a>&#60;/ref&#62; In other countries, such as <a href="/Italy" title="Italy">Italy</a> and <a href="/Argentina" title="Argentina">Argentina</a>, one word is used for all variants.

<p>Take Tin Ice-Pots, fill them with any Sort of Cream you like, either plain or sweeten’d, or Fruit in it; shut your Pots very close; to six Pots you must allow eighteen or twenty Pound of Ice, breaking the Ice very small; there will be some great Pieces, which lay at the Bottom and Top: You must have a Pail, and lay some Straw at the Bottom; then lay in your Ice, and put in amongst it a Pound of Bay-Salt; set in your Pots of Cream, and 93 lay Ice and Salt between every Pot, that they may not touch; but the Ice must lie round them on every Side; lay a good deal of Ice on the Top, cover the Pail with Straw, set it in a Cellar where no Sun or Light comes, it will be froze in four Hours, but it may stand longer; then take it out just as you use it; hold it in your Hand and it will slip out. When you wou’d freeze any Sort of Fruit, either Cherries, Rasberries, Currants, or Strawberries, fill your Tin-Pots with the Fruit, but as hollow as you can; put to them Lemmonade, made with Spring-Water and Lemmon-Juice sweeten’d; put enough in the Pots to make the Fruit hang together, and put them in Ice as you do Cream.

<p>The history of ice cream in the 20th century is one of great change and increases in availability and popularity. In the United States in the early 20th century, the ice cream soda was a popular treat at the <a href="/Soda_shop" title="Soda shop">soda shop</a>, the <a href="/Soda_fountain" title="Soda fountain">soda fountain</a>, and the <a href="/Ice_cream_parlor" title="Ice cream parlor">ice cream parlor</a>.

<p>Ice cream became popular throughout the world in the second half of the 20th century after cheap <a href="/Refrigeration" title="Refrigeration">refrigeration</a> became common. There was an explosion of ice cream stores and of flavours and types. Vendors often competed on the basis of variety. <a href="/Howard_Johnson&#39;s" title="Howard Johnson&#39;s">Howard Johnson&#39;s</a> restaurants advertised &#34;a world of 28 flavors&#34;. <a href="/Baskin-Robbins" title="Baskin-Robbins">Baskin-Robbins</a> made its 31 flavours (&#34;one for every day of the month&#34;) the cornerstone of its <a href="/Marketing_strategy" title="Marketing strategy">marketing strategy</a>. The company now boasts that it has developed over 1000 varieties.</p>
<p>One important development in the 20th century was the introduction of <a href="/Soft_serve" title="Soft serve">soft ice cream</a>, which has more air mixed in thereby reducing costs. It made possible the soft ice cream machine in which a cone is filled beneath a <a href="/Tap_(valve)" title="Tap (valve)">spigot</a> on order.

Before the development of modern <a href="/Refrigeration" title="Refrigeration">refrigeration</a>, ice cream was a luxury reserved for special occasions. Making it was quite laborious; ice was cut from lakes and ponds during the winter and stored in holes in the ground, or in wood-frame or brick <a href="/Icehouse_(building)" title="Icehouse (building)">ice houses</a>, insulated by straw. Many farmers and plantation owners, including <a href="/President_of_the_United_States" title="President of the United States">U.S. Presidents</a> <a href="/George_Washington" title="George Washington">George Washington</a> and <a href="/Thomas_Jefferson" title="Thomas Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a>, cut and stored ice in the winter for use in the summer. <a href="/Frederic_Tudor" title="Frederic Tudor">Frederic Tudor</a> of Boston turned ice harvesting and shipping into a big business, cutting ice in New England and shipping it around the world.</p>
<p>Ice cream was made by hand in a large bowl placed inside a tub filled with ice and salt. This was called the pot-freezer method. French confectioners refined the pot-freezer method, making ice cream in a sorbetière (a covered pail with a handle attached to the lid). In the pot-freezer method, the temperature of the ingredients is reduced by the mixture of crushed ice and salt. The salt water is cooled by the ice, and the action of the salt on the ice causes it to (partially) melt, absorbing <a href="/Latent_heat" title="Latent heat">latent heat</a> and bringing the mixture below the <a href="/Freezing_point" title="Freezing point">freezing point</a> of pure water. The immersed container can also make better thermal contact with the salty water and ice mixture than it could with ice alone.

<p>
The hand-cranked churn, which also uses ice and salt for cooling, replaced the pot-freezer method. The exact origin of the hand-cranked freezer is unknown, but the first U.S. patent for one was #3254 issued to Nancy Johnson on 9 September 1843. The hand-cranked churn produced smoother ice cream than the pot freezer and did it quicker. Many inventors patented improvements on Johnson&#39;s design.</p>

In Europe and early America, ice cream was made and sold by small businesses, mostly confectioners and caterers. Jacob Fussell of Baltimore, Maryland was the first to manufacture ice cream on a large scale. Fussell bought fresh dairy products from farmers in York County, Pennsylvania, and sold them in Baltimore. An unstable demand for his dairy products often left him with a surplus of cream, which he made into ice cream. He built his first ice cream factory in Seven Valleys, Pennsylvania, in 1851. Two years later, he moved his factory to Baltimore. Later, he opened factories in several other cities and taught the business to others, who operated their own plants. Mass production reduced the cost of ice cream and added to its popularity.</p>
<p>The development of industrial refrigeration by German engineer <a href="/Carl_von_Linde" title="Carl von Linde">Carl von Linde</a> during the 1870s eliminated the need to cut and store natural ice, and, when the continuous-process freezer was perfected in 1926, commercial mass production of ice cream and the birth of the modern ice cream industry was underway.</p>
<p>The most common method for producing ice cream at home is to use an <a href="/Ice_cream_maker" title="Ice cream maker">ice cream maker</a>, in modern times, in general, an electrical device that churns the ice cream mixture while cooled inside a household freezer, or using a solution of pre-frozen salt and water, which gradually melts while the ice cream freezes. Some more expensive models have an inbuilt freezing element. A newer method of making home-made ice cream is to add <a href="/Liquid_nitrogen" title="Liquid nitrogen">liquid nitrogen</a> to the mixture while stirring it using a spoon or spatula for a few seconds; a similar technique, advocated by <a href="/Heston_Blumenthal" title="Heston Blumenthal">Heston Blumenthal</a> as ideal for home cooks, is to add <a href="/Dry_ice" title="Dry ice">dry ice</a> to the mixture while stirring for a few minutes.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite episode |title= Eggs |episodelink= |url= |accessdate= |series=How to Cook Like Heston |serieslink= |first=Heston |last=Blumenthal |network=<a href="/Channel_4" title="Channel 4">Channel 4</a> | date= |began= |ended= |seriesno=1 |number= 02 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcripturl= |quote= |language=}}&#60;/ref&#62; Some ice cream recipes call for making a custard, folding in whipped cream, and immediately freezing the mixture.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite book|last1=Tharp, Ph.D.|first1=Bruce|last2=Young, Ph.D.|first2=L.

<p>Today, jobs specialize in the selling of ice cream. The title of a person who works in this speciality is often called an &#39;ice cream man&#39;, however women also specialize in the selling of ice cream. People in this line of work often sell ice cream on beaches. On beaches, ice cream is either sold by a person who carries a box full of ice cream and is called over by people who want the purchase ice cream, or by a person who drives up to the top of the beach and rings a bell. In the second method, people go up to the top of the beach and purchase ice cream straight from the ice cream seller, who is often in an <a href="/Ice_cream_van" title="Ice cream van">ice cream van</a>.  In Turkey and Australia, ice cream is sometimes sold to beach-goers from small powerboats equipped with chest freezers.</p>
<p>Some ice cream distributors sell ice cream products from traveling refrigerated vans or carts (commonly referred to in the US as &#34;<a href="/Ice_cream_van" title="Ice cream van">ice cream trucks</a>&#34;), sometimes equipped with speakers playing children&#39;s music or folk melodies (such as &#34;<a href="/Turkey_in_the_Straw" title="Turkey in the Straw">Turkey in the Straw</a>&#34;).  The driver of an ice cream van drives throughout neighborhoods and stops every so often, usually every block. The seller on the ice cream van sells the ice cream through a large window; this window is also where the customer asks for ice cream and pays.  Ice cream vans in the United Kingdom make a <a href="/Musical_box" title="Musical box">music box</a> noise rather than actual music.</p>

<p>Using <a href="/Liquid_nitrogen" title="Liquid nitrogen">liquid nitrogen</a> to freeze ice cream is an old idea and has been used for many years{{huh?|date=July 2015}} to harden ice cream. The use of liquid nitrogen in the primary freezing of ice cream, that is to effect the transition from the liquid to the frozen state without the use of a conventional ice cream freezer, has only recently started to see commercialization.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite journal|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.subzeroicecream.com/press/coldfacts2006.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.subzeroicecream.com/press/coldfacts2006.pdf</a>|format=PDF|title=Mmmm...Cryogenically Frozen Ice Cream|work=Cold Facts|year=2006|volume=22|issue=3|pages=6–7}}&#60;/ref&#62; The most noted brands are{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} <a href="/Dippin&#39;_Dots" title="Dippin&#39; Dots">Dippin&#39; Dots</a>, Blue Sky Creamery, Project Creamery, and Sub Zero Cryo Creamery. The preparation results in a column of white condensed <a href="/Water_vapor" title="Water vapor">water vapour</a> cloud, reminiscent of popular depictions of <a href="/Witchcraft" title="Witchcraft">witches</a>&#39; cauldrons. The ice cream, dangerous to eat while still &#34;steaming&#34;, is allowed to rest until the liquid nitrogen is completely vapourised. Sometimes ice cream is frozen to the sides of the container, and must be allowed to thaw.</p>
<p>Making ice cream with liquid nitrogen has advantages over conventional freezing. Due to the rapid freezing, the <a href="/Crystal" title="Crystal">crystal</a> grains are smaller, giving the ice cream a creamier texture, and allowing one to get the same texture by using less milkfat.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} Such <a href="/Ice_crystals" title="Ice crystals">ice crystals</a> will grow very quickly via the processes of recrystallization, thereby obviating the original benefits unless steps are taken to inhibit ice crystal growth.</p>
<p>For similar reasons, good results can also be achieved with the more readily available <a href="/Dry_ice" title="Dry ice">dry ice</a>, and authors such as <a href="/Heston_Blumenthal" title="Heston Blumenthal">Heston Blumenthal</a> have published recipes to produce ice cream and <a href="/Sorbet" title="Sorbet">sorbet</a> using a simple blender.&#60;ref&#62;Heston At Home- Heston Blumenthal&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
