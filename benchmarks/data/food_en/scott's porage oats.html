<p>Scott&#39;s claims to use only the highest quality oats and milling processes. The company does not state the origin of the oats themselves. The oats are rolled thicker than standard oats and are gently kilned to create what the company considers to be &#34;the truest taste&#34;.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external autonumber" href="http://www.dooyoo.co.uk/food/scott-s-porage-oats/1021339/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> Dooyoo.co.uk/package description accessed 5 January 2007&#60;/ref&#62; </p>
<p>Scott&#39;s oats can be made into porridge either in the microwave or on a stovetop, with the addition of milk or water and other flavourings (typically salt or sugar). Oats can also be used in stews, as a topping for apple crumble or haddock pies, and in cookies or flapjacks, and in many other recipes. Some packs come with a number of suggested recipes.</p>
