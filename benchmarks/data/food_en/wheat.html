<p>There are six wheat classifications: 1) hard red winter, 2) hard red spring, 3) soft red winter, 4) durum (hard), 5) hard white, and 6) soft white wheat.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} 
The hard wheats have the highest gluten content and are used for making bread, rolls and all-purpose flour. The soft wheats are used for making flat bread, cakes, pastries, crackers, muffins, and 
biscuits. A high percentage of wheat production in the EU is used as animal feed, often surplus to human requirements or low-quality wheat.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external free" href="http://www.feedipedia.org/node/223&#60;/ref&#38;gt" rel="nofollow">http://www.feedipedia.org/node/223&#60;/ref&#38;gt</a>;</p>

<p>Wheat is one of the first cereals known to have been domesticated, and wheat&#39;s ability to self-pollinate greatly facilitated the selection of many distinct domesticated varieties.

<p>  Cultivation and repeated harvesting and sowing of the grains of wild grasses led to the creation of domestic strains, as mutant forms (&#39;sports&#39;) of wheat were preferentially chosen by farmers. In domesticated wheat, grains are larger, and the seeds (inside the spikelets) remain attached to the ear by a toughened <a href="/Rachis" title="Rachis">rachis</a> during harvesting. In wild strains, a more fragile rachis allows the ear to easily <a href="/Shattering_(agriculture)" title="Shattering (agriculture)">shatter</a> and disperse the spikelets.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite journal | last1 = Tanno | first1 = K Willcox | year = 2006 | title = How fast was wild wheat domesticated? | url = | journal = Science | volume = 311 | issue = 5769| page = 1886 | doi = 10.1126/science.1124635 | pmid = 16574859 | last2 = Willcox | first2 = G}}&#60;/ref&#62; Selection for these traits by farmers might not have been deliberately intended, but simply have occurred because these traits made gathering the seeds easier; nevertheless such &#39;incidental&#39; selection was an important part of crop <a href="/Domestication" title="Domestication">domestication</a>.

Technological advances in soil preparation and seed placement at planting time, use of crop rotation and fertilizers to improve plant growth, and advances in harvesting methods have all combined to promote wheat as a viable crop. Agricultural cultivation using <a href="/Horse_collar" title="Horse collar">horse collar</a> leveraged plows (at about 3000&#38;nbsp;BCE) was one of the first innovations that increased productivity. Much later, when the use of <a href="/Seed_drill" title="Seed drill">seed drills</a> replaced broadcasting sowing of seed in the 18th century, another great increase in productivity occurred.</p>
<p>Yields of pure wheat per unit area increased as methods of <a href="/Crop_rotation" title="Crop rotation">crop rotation</a> were applied to long cultivated land, and the use of <a href="/Fertilizer" title="Fertilizer">fertilizers</a> became widespread. Improved agricultural husbandry has more recently included threshing machines and reaping machines (the &#39;<a href="/Combine_harvester" title="Combine harvester">combine harvester</a>&#39;), <a href="/Tractor" title="Tractor">tractor</a>-drawn cultivators and planters, and better varieties (see <a href="/Green_Revolution" title="Green Revolution">Green Revolution</a> and <a href="/Norin_10_wheat" title="Norin 10 wheat">Norin 10 wheat</a>). Great expansion of wheat production occurred as new arable land was farmed in the Americas and Australia in the 19th and 20th centuries.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Genetics">Genetics</span></h2>
<p>Wheat genetics is more complicated than that of most other domesticated species. Some wheat species are <a href="/Diploid" title="Diploid">diploid</a>, with two sets of <a href="/Chromosome" title="Chromosome">chromosomes</a>, but many are stable <a href="/Polyploidy" title="Polyploidy">polyploids</a>, with four sets of chromosomes (<a href="/Tetraploid" title="Tetraploid">tetraploid</a>) or six (<a href="/Hexaploid" title="Hexaploid">hexaploid</a>).&#60;ref name=Hancock&#62;Hancock, James F.

<li>Most tetraploid wheats (e.g. <a href="/Emmer" title="Emmer">emmer</a> and <a href="/Durum" title="Durum">durum wheat</a>) are derived from <a href="/Emmer#Wild_emmer" title="Emmer">wild emmer</a>, <i>T. dicoccoides</i>. Wild emmer is itself the result of a hybridization between two diploid wild grasses, <i>T. urartu</i> and a wild goatgrass such as <i>Aegilops searsii</i> or <i><a href="/Aegilops_speltoides" title="Aegilops speltoides">Ae. speltoides</a></i>. The unknown grass has never been identified among now surviving wild grasses, but the closest living relative is <i>Aegilops speltoides</i>.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} The hybridization that formed wild emmer (AABB) occurred in the wild, long before domestication,&#60;ref name=Hancock/&#62; and was driven by natural selection.</li>
<li>Hexaploid wheats evolved in farmers&#39; fields. Either domesticated emmer or durum wheat hybridized with yet another wild diploid grass (<i><a href="/Aegilops_tauschii" title="Aegilops tauschii">Aegilops tauschii</a></i>) to make the <a href="/Hexaploid" title="Hexaploid">hexaploid</a> wheats, <a href="/Spelt" title="Spelt">spelt</a> wheat and <a href="/Common_wheat" title="Common wheat">bread wheat</a>.&#60;ref name=Hancock /&#62; These have <i>three</i> sets of paired chromosomes, three times as many as in diploid wheat.</li>

<p>The presence of certain versions of wheat genes has been important for crop yields. Apart from mutant versions of genes selected in antiquity during domestication, there has been more recent deliberate selection of <a href="/Alleles" title="Alleles">alleles</a> that affect growth characteristics. Genes for the &#39;dwarfing&#39; trait, first used by <a href="/Norin_10_wheat" title="Norin 10 wheat">Japanese wheat breeders</a> to produce short-stalked wheat, have had a huge effect on wheat yields world-wide, and were major factors in the success of the <a href="/Green_Revolution" title="Green Revolution">Green Revolution</a> in Mexico and Asia, an initiative led by <a href="/Norman_Borlaug" title="Norman Borlaug">Norman Borlaug</a>. Dwarfing genes enable the carbon that is fixed in the plant during photosynthesis to be diverted towards seed production, and they also help prevent the problem of lodging. &#39;Lodging&#39; occurs when an ear stalk falls over in the wind and rots on the ground, and heavy nitrogenous fertilization of wheat makes the grass grow taller and become more susceptible to this problem. By 1997, 81% of the developing world&#39;s wheat area was planted to semi-dwarf wheats, giving both increased yields and better response to nitrogenous fertilizer.</p>

<p>This sequence data provides direct access to about 96,000 genes, relying on orthologous gene sets from
other cereals. and represents an essential step towards a systematic understanding of biology and engineering the cereal crop for valuable traits. Its implications in cereal genetics and breeding includes the examination of genome variation, association mapping using natural populations, performing wide crosses and alien introgression, studying the expression and nucleotide polymorphism in transcriptomes, analyzing population genetics and evolutionary biology, and studying the epigenetic modifications. Moreover, the availability of large-scale genetic markers generated through NGS technology will facilitate trait mapping and make marker-assisted breeding much feasible.&#60;ref name=&#34;currentscience.ac.in&#34;&#62;<a class="external free" href="http://www.currentscience.ac.in/Volumes/104/03/0286.pdf&#60;/ref&#38;gt" rel="nofollow">http://www.currentscience.ac.in/Volumes/104/03/0286.pdf&#60;/ref&#38;gt</a>;</p>
<p>Moreover, the data not only facilitate in deciphering the complex phenomena such as heterosis and epigenetics, it may also enable breeders to predict which fragment of a chromosome is derived from which parent in the progeny line, thereby recognizing crossover events occurring in every progeny line and inserting markers on genetic and physical maps without ambiguity. In due course, this will assist in introducing specific chromosomal segments from one cultivar to another. Besides, the researchers had identified diverse classes of genes participating in energy production, metabolism and growth that were probably linked with crop yield, which can now be utilized for the development of transgenic wheat. Thus whole genome sequence of wheat and the availability of thousands of SNPs will inevitably permit the breeders to stride towards identifying novel traits, providing biological knowledge and empowering biodiversity-based breeding.&#60;ref name=&#34;currentscience.ac.in&#34;/&#62;</p>

<p>In traditional agricultural systems wheat populations often consist of <a href="/Landraces" title="Landraces">landraces</a>, informal farmer-maintained populations that often maintain high levels of morphological diversity. Although landraces of wheat are no longer grown in Europe and North America, they continue to be important elsewhere. The origins of formal wheat breeding lie in the nineteenth century, when single line varieties were created through selection of seed from a single plant noted to have desired properties. Modern wheat breeding developed in the first years of the twentieth century and was closely linked to the development of <a href="/Mendelian_genetics" title="Mendelian genetics">Mendelian genetics</a>. The standard method of breeding inbred wheat cultivars is by crossing two lines using hand emasculation, then selfing or inbreeding the progeny.

This more primitive morphology (in evolutionary terms) consists of toughened glumes that tightly enclose the grains, and (in domesticated wheats) a semi-brittle rachis that breaks easily on threshing. The result is that when threshed, the wheat ear breaks up into spikelets. To obtain the grain, further processing, such as milling or pounding, is needed to remove the hulls or husks. In contrast, in free-threshing (or naked) forms such as durum wheat and common wheat, the glumes are fragile and the rachis tough. On threshing, the chaff breaks up, releasing the grains. Hulled wheats are often stored as spikelets because the toughened glumes give good protection against pests of stored grain.&#60;ref name=Potts /&#62;</p>

There are many botanical classification systems used for wheat species, discussed in a separate article on <a href="/Wheat_taxonomy" title="Wheat taxonomy">wheat taxonomy</a>. The name of a wheat species from one information source may not be the name of a wheat species in another.</p>
<p>Within a species, wheat cultivars are further classified by wheat breeders and farmers in terms of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Growing season, such as <a href="/Winter_wheat" title="Winter wheat">winter wheat</a> vs. spring wheat.&#60;ref name=CVDE /&#62;</li>
<li><a href="/Protein" title="Protein">Protein</a> content. Bread wheat protein content ranges from 10% in some soft wheats with high starch contents, to 15% in hard wheats.</li>
<li>The quality of the wheat protein <a href="/Gluten" title="Gluten">gluten</a>. This protein can determine the suitability of a wheat to a particular dish. A strong and elastic gluten present in bread wheats enables <a href="/Dough" title="Dough">dough</a> to trap carbon dioxide during leavening, but elastic gluten interferes with the rolling of <a href="/Pasta" title="Pasta">pasta</a> into thin sheets. The gluten protein in durum wheats used for pasta is strong but not elastic.</li>
<li>Grain color (red, white or amber). Many wheat varieties are reddish-brown due to phenolic compounds present in the bran layer which are transformed to pigments by browning enzymes. White wheats have a lower content of phenolics and browning enzymes, and are generally less astringent in taste than red wheats. The yellowish color of durum wheat and <a href="/Semolina" title="Semolina">semolina</a> flour made from it is due to a <a href="/Carotenoid" title="Carotenoid">carotenoid</a> pigment called <a href="/Lutein" title="Lutein">lutein</a>, which can be oxidized to a colorless form by enzymes present in the grain.</li>
</ul>

World trade in wheat is greater than for all other crops combined. With rice, wheat is the world&#39;s most favored staple food. It is a major diet component because of the wheat plant&#39;s agronomic adaptability with the ability to grow from near arctic regions to equator, from sea level to plains of Tibet, approximately {{convert|4000|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level. In addition to agronomic adaptability, wheat offers ease of grain storage and ease of converting grain into flour for making edible, palatable, interesting and satisfying foods.

<p>Raw forms of these staples, however, are not edible and cannot be digested. These must be sprouted, or prepared and cooked as appropriate for human consumption. In sprouted or cooked form, the relative nutritional and anti-nutritional contents of each of these grains is remarkably different from that of raw form of these grains reported in this table.</p>

In recent years, low international wheat prices have often encouraged farmers in the United States to change to more profitable crops. In 1998, the price at harvest was $2.68 per <a href="/Bushel" title="Bushel">bushel</a>. USDA report&#60;ref&#62;{{Citation | last = Ali | first = MB | year = 2002 | title = Characteristics and production costs of US wheat farms | id = SB-974-5 ERS | publisher = USDA}}&#60;/ref&#62; revealed that in 1998, average operating costs were $1.43 per bushel and total costs were $3.97 per bushel. In that study, farm wheat yields averaged 41.7 bushels per acre (2.2435 metric ton/hectare), and typical total wheat production value was $31,900 per farm, with total farm production value (including other crops) of $173,681 per farm, plus $17,402 in government payments. There were significant profitability differences between low- and high-cost farms, mainly due to crop yield differences, location, and farm size.</p>
<p>In 2007 there was a dramatic rise in the price of wheat due to freezes and flooding in the Northern Hemisphere and a drought in Australia. Wheat futures in September, 2007 for December and March delivery had risen above $9.00 a bushel, prices never seen before.&#60;ref&#62;{{Citation|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.kansascity.com/business/story/295713.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kansascity.com/business/story/295713.html</a> |title=Wheat futures again hit new highs |type=article |first=Victoria Sizemore |last=Long |newspaper=<a href="/The_Kansas_City_Star" title="The Kansas City Star">The Kansas City Star</a> |date=28 September 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=<a class="external free" href="https://web.archive.org/20071020041417/http://www.kansascity.com:80/business/story/295713.html" rel="nofollow">https://web.archive.org/20071020041417/http://www.kansascity.com:80/business/story/295713.html</a> |archivedate=20 October 2007 }}&#60;/ref&#62; There were complaints in Italy about the high price of pasta.</p>

Unlike rice, wheat production is more widespread globally though China&#39;s share is almost one-sixth of the world.</p>
<p>&#34;There is a little increase in yearly crop yield comparison to the year 1990. The reason for this is not in development of sowing area, but the slow and successive increasing of the average yield. Average 2.5 tons wheat was produced on one hectare crop land in the world in the first half of 1990s, however this value was about 3 tons in 2009. In the world per capita wheat producing area continuously decreased between 1990 and 2009 considering the change of world population. There was no significant change in wheat producing area in this period. However, due to the improvement of average yields there is some fluctuation in each year considering the per capita production, but there is no considerable decline. In 1990 per capita production was 111.98 kg/capita/year, while it was already 100.62 kg/capita/year in 2009. The decline is evident and the per capita production level of the year 1990 can not be feasible simultaneously with the growth of world population in spite of the increased average yields. In the whole period the lowest per capita production was in 2006.&#34;&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|last=Kiss|first=Istvan|title=Significance of wheat production in world economy and position of Hungary in it|url=<a class="external free" href="http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/bitstream/104650/2/14_Kiss_Signification_Apstract.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/bitstream/104650/2/14_Kiss_Signification_Apstract.pdf</a>|publisher=Agroinform Publishing House, Budapest, Hungary|accessdate=2 February 2013}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>In the 20th century, global wheat output expanded by about 5-fold, but until about 1955 most of this reflected increases in wheat crop area, with lesser (about 20%) increases in crop yields per unit area. After 1955 however, there was a dramatic ten-fold increase in the rate of wheat yield improvement per year, and this became the major factor allowing global wheat production to increase. Thus technological innovation and scientific crop management with <a href="/Haber_process" title="Haber process">synthetic nitrogen fertilizer</a>, irrigation and wheat breeding were the main drivers of wheat output growth in the second half of the century. There were some significant decreases in wheat crop area, for instance in North America.&#60;ref&#62;See Chapter 1, Slafer GA, Satorre EH (1999) <i>Wheat: Ecology and Physiology of Yield Determination</i> Haworth Press Technology &#38; Industrial <a class="external text" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1560228741" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1560228741">ISBN 1-56022-874-1</a>.&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>Better seed storage and germination ability (and hence a smaller requirement to retain harvested crop for next year&#39;s seed) is another 20th century technological innovation. In Medieval England, farmers saved one-quarter of their wheat harvest as seed for the next crop, leaving only three-quarters for food and feed consumption. By 1999, the global average seed use of wheat was about 6% of output.</p>
<p>Several factors are currently slowing the rate of global expansion of wheat production: population growth rates are falling while wheat yields continue to rise, and the better economic profitability of other crops such as soybeans and maize, linked with investment in modern genetic technologies, has promoted shifts to other crops.</p>

In the <a href="/Punjab_region" title="Punjab region">Punjab region</a> of <a href="/India" title="India">India</a> and <a href="/Pakistan" title="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>, as well as North China, irrigation has been a major contributor to increased grain output. More widely over the last 40 years, a massive increase in fertilizer use together with the increased availability of semi-dwarf varieties in developing countries, has greatly increased yields per hectare. In developing countries, use of (mainly nitrogenous) fertilizer increased 25-fold in this period. However, farming systems rely on much more than fertilizer and breeding to improve productivity. A good illustration of this is Australian wheat growing in the southern winter cropping zone, where, despite low rainfall (300&#38;nbsp;mm), wheat cropping is successful even with relatively little use of nitrogenous fertilizer. This is achieved by &#39;rotation cropping&#39; (traditionally called the ley system) with leguminous pastures and, in the last decade, including a <a href="/Canola" title="Canola">canola</a> crop in the rotations has boosted wheat yields by a further 25%.&#60;ref&#62;Swaminathan MS (2004) <a class="external text" href="http://www.cropscience.org.au/icsc2004/plenary/0/2159_swaminathan.htm" rel="nofollow">Stocktake on cropping and crop science for a diverse planet</a>&#60;/ref&#62; In these low rainfall areas, better use of available soil-water (and better control of soil erosion) is achieved by retaining the stubble after harvesting and by minimizing tillage.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.grainscouncil.com/EMS/06_Nov_02_Production_Farming_Practices.pdf" rel="nofollow">Umbers, Alan (2006, Grains Council of Australia Limited) Grains Industry trends in Production - Results from Today&#39;s Farming Practices</a>&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>In 2009, the most productive farms for wheat were in France producing 7.45 metric tonnes per hectare (although French production has low protein content and requires blending with higher protein wheat to meet the specifications required in some countries). The five largest producers of wheat in 2009 were China (115 million metric tonnes), India (81 MMT), Russian Federation (62 MMT), United States (60 MMT) and France (38 MMT). The wheat farm productivity in India and Russia were about 35% of the wheat farm productivity in France. China&#39;s farm productivity for wheat, in 2009, was about double that of Russia.&#60;ref name=OSU2009/&#62;</p>
<p>In addition to gaps in farming system technology and knowledge, some large wheat grain producing countries have significant losses after harvest at the farm and because of poor roads, inadequate storage technologies, inefficient supply chains and farmers&#39; inability to bring the produce into retail markets dominated by small shopkeepers. Various studies in India, for example, have concluded that about 10% of total wheat production is lost at farm level, another 10% is lost because of poor storage and road networks, and additional amounts lost at the retail level. One study claims that if these post-harvest wheat grain losses could be eliminated with better infrastructure and retail network, in India alone enough food would be saved every year to feed 70 to 100 million people over a year.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite journal|title=Economic Analysis of Post-harvest Losses in Food Grains in India: A Case Study of Karnataka| first1 = H. | last1 = Basavaraja |journal=Agricultural Economics Research Review|volume=20|pages=117–126|url=<a class="external free" href="http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/bitstream/47429/2/8.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/bitstream/47429/2/8.pdf</a>|display-authors=etal}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>

<p>In the past, there has been significant governmental intervention in wheat markets, such as price supports in the US and farm payments in the EU. In the EU these subsidies have encouraged heavy use of fertilizer inputs with resulting high crop yields.

<p>Wheat normally needs between 110 and 130 days between sowing and harvest, depending upon climate, seed type, and soil conditions (winter wheat lies dormant during a winter freeze). Optimal crop management requires that the farmer have a detailed understanding of each stage of development in the growing plants. In particular, spring <a href="/Fertilizer" title="Fertilizer">fertilizers</a>, <a href="/Herbicide" title="Herbicide">herbicides</a>, <a href="/Fungicide" title="Fungicide">fungicides</a>, and <a href="/Plant_hormone" title="Plant hormone">growth regulators</a> are typically applied only at specific stages of plant development. For example, it is currently recommended that the second application of nitrogen is best done when the ear (not visible at this stage) is about 1&#38;nbsp;cm in size (Z31 on <a href="/Zadoks_scale" title="Zadoks scale">Zadoks scale</a>). Knowledge of stages is also important to identify periods of higher risk from the climate. For example, pollen formation from the mother cell, and the stages between <a href="/Anthesis" title="Anthesis">anthesis</a> and maturity are susceptible to high temperatures, and this adverse effect is made worse by water stress.&#60;ref&#62;Slafer GA, Satorre EH (1999) <i>Wheat: Ecology and Physiology of Yield Determination</i> Haworth Press Technology &#38; Industrial <a class="external text" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1560228741" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1560228741">ISBN 1-56022-874-1</a>. pp 322-3

Early in the season, many species of birds, including the <a href="/Long-tailed_widowbird" title="Long-tailed widowbird">long-tailed widowbird</a>, and rodents feed upon wheat crops. These animals can cause significant damage to a crop by digging up and eating newly planted seeds or young plants. They can also damage the crop late in the season by eating the grain from the mature spike. Recent post-harvest losses in cereals amount to billions of dollars per year in the United States alone, and damage to wheat by various borers, beetles and weevils is no exception.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.entomology.wisc.edu/mbcn/fea210.html" rel="nofollow">Biological Control of Stored-Product Pests.
