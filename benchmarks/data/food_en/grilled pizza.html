<p><b>Grilled pizza</b> is created by taking a fairly thin round (more typically, an irregularly-shaped sheet) of a yeasted <a href="/Pizza" title="Pizza">pizza</a> dough, placing it directly over the fire of a grill, and then turning it over once the bottom has baked and placing a thin layer of toppings on the baked side. Toppings are generally as thin as possible to ensure that they heat through, and chunkier toppings such as sausage or peppers may be precooked before placing on the pizza; it is not uncommon to add garlic, herbs, or other ingredients to the crust to maximize the flavor of the dish.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}</p>
