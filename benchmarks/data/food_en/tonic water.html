<p>The drink gained its name from the effects of its <a href="/Bitter_(taste)#Bitterness" title="Bitter (taste)">bitter</a> flavoring. The <a href="/Quinine" title="Quinine">quinine</a> was added to the drink as a <a href="/Prophylaxis" title="Prophylaxis">prophylactic</a> against <a href="/Malaria" title="Malaria">malaria</a>, since it was originally intended for consumption in tropical areas of <a href="/South_Asia" title="South Asia">South Asia</a> and <a href="/Africa" title="Africa">Africa</a>, where the disease is <a href="/Endemic_(epidemiology)" title="Endemic (epidemiology)">endemic</a>. Quinine powder was so bitter that British officials stationed in early 19th Century India and other tropical posts began mixing the powder with soda and sugar, and a basic tonic water was created. The first commercial tonic water was produced in 1858.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|last=Raustiala|first=Kal|title=The Imperial Cocktail|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/foreigners/2013/08/gin_and_tonic_kept_the_british_empire_healthy_the_drink_s_quinine_powder.single.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/foreigners/2013/08/gin_and_tonic_kept_the_british_empire_healthy_the_drink_s_quinine_powder.single.html</a>|work=<a href="/Slate_(magazine)" title="Slate (magazine)">Slate (magazine)</a>|publisher=<a href="/The_Slate_Group" title="The Slate Group">The Slate Group</a>|accessdate=30 August 2013}}&#60;/ref&#62;   The <a href="/Mixed_drink" title="Mixed drink">mixed drink</a> <a href="/Gin_and_tonic" title="Gin and tonic">gin and tonic</a> also originated in <a href="/British_India" title="British India">British colonial India</a>, when the British population would mix their medicinal quinine tonic with <a href="/Gin" title="Gin">gin</a>. </p>
<p>Since 2010, at least four tonic syrups have been released in the US. Consumers add carbonated water to the syrup to make tonic water; this allows drinkers to vary the intensity of the flavour.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web |title=Building a Better G&#38;T |work=WSJ Online |date=15 August 2012 |url=<a class="external free" href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111904007304576498850877686860.html" rel="nofollow">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111904007304576498850877686860.html</a>}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>

<p>Medicinal tonic water originally contained only <a href="/Carbonated_water" title="Carbonated water">carbonated water</a> and a large amount of <a href="/Quinine" title="Quinine">quinine</a>. However, most tonic water today contains a less significant amount of quinine, and is thus used mostly for its flavor. As a consequence, it is less bitter, and is also usually sweetened, often with <a href="/High_fructose_corn_syrup" title="High fructose corn syrup">high fructose corn syrup</a> or sugar. Some manufacturers also produce diet (or slimline) tonic water, which may contain artificial sweeteners such as <a href="/Aspartame" title="Aspartame">aspartame</a>. Traditional-style tonic water with little more than quinine and carbonated water is less common, but may be preferred by those who desire the bitter flavor.</p>
