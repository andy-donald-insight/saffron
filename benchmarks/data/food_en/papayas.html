<p><a href="/Papaya_ringspot_virus" title="Papaya ringspot virus">Papaya ringspot virus</a> is a well-known virus within plants in Florida.&#60;ref name=&#34;morton&#34;/&#62; The first signs of the virus are yellowing and vein-clearing of younger leaves, as well as mottling yellow leaves. Infected leaves may obtain blisters, roughen or narrow, with blades sticking upwards from the middle of the leaves. The petioles and stems may develop dark green greasy streaks and in time become shorter. The ringspots are circular, C-shaped markings that are darker green than the fruit itself. In the later stages of the virus, the markings may become gray and crusty. Viral infections impact growth and reduce the fruit&#39;s quality. One of the biggest effects that viral infections have on papaya is the taste. As of 2010, the only way to protect papaya from this virus is genetic modification.&#60;ref name=&#34;papaya ringspot&#34;&#62;{{cite web |url=<a class="external free" href="https://www.apsnet.org/edcenter/intropp/lessons/viruses/Pages/PapayaRingspotvirus.aspx" rel="nofollow">https://www.apsnet.org/edcenter/intropp/lessons/viruses/Pages/PapayaRingspotvirus.aspx</a> |authors=Gonsalves, D., S.

<p>The <a href="/Papaya_mosaic_virus" title="Papaya mosaic virus">papaya mosaic virus</a> destroys the plant until only a small tuft of leaves are left. The virus affects both the leaves of the plant and the fruit. Leaves show thin, irregular, dark-green lines around the borders and clear areas around the veins. The more severely affected leaves are irregular and linear in shape. The virus can infect the fruit at any stage of its maturity. Fruits as young as 2 weeks old have been spotted with dark-green ringspots about 1 inch in diameter. Rings on the fruit are most likely seen on either the stem end or the blossom end. In the early stages of the ringspots, the rings tend to be many closed circles, but as the disease develops, the rings will increase in diameter consisting of one large ring. The difference between the ringspot and the mosaic viruses is the ripe fruit in the ringspot has mottling of colors and mosaic does not.&#60;ref name=&#34;papaya mosaic&#34;&#62;{{cite web | url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.ctahr.hawaii.edu/oc/freepubs/pdf/B-136.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.ctahr.hawaii.edu/oc/freepubs/pdf/B-136.pdf</a> |last1= Hine |first1=B.R. |last2=Holtsmann |first2=O.V. |last3=Raabe |first3=R.D. |date=July 1965 |title=Disease of papaya in Hawaii}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Fungi">Fungi</span></h4>
<p>The fungus <a href="/Anthracnose" title="Anthracnose">anthracnose</a> is known to specifically attack papaya, especially the mature fruits. The disease starts out small with very few signs, such as water-soaked spots on ripening fruits.  The spots become sunken, turn brown or black, and may get bigger. In some of the older spots, the fungus may produce pink spores. The fruit ends up being soft and having an off flavor because the fungus grows into the fruit.&#60;ref name=&#34;test&#34;/&#62;</p>
<p>The fungus <a href="/Powdery_mildew" title="Powdery mildew">powdery mildew</a> occurs as a superficial white presence on the surface of the leaf in which it is easily recognized. Tiny, light yellow spots begin on the lower surfaces of the leaf as the disease starts to make its way. The spots enlarge and white powdery growth appears on the leaves. The infection usually appears at the upper leaf surface as white fungal growth. Powdery mildew is not as severe as other diseases.&#60;ref name=&#34;powdery mildew&#34;&#62;{{cite web |url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.ctahr.hawaii.edu/oc/freepubs/pdf/PD-90.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.ctahr.hawaii.edu/oc/freepubs/pdf/PD-90.pdf</a> |authors=Cunningham, B. &#38; Nelson, S. (2012, June) |title=Powdery mildew of papaya in Hawaii}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>The fungus phythphthora blight causes damping-off, root rot, stem rot, stem girdling, and fruit rot. Damping-off happens in very young plants by wilting and death in plant. The spots on established plants start out as water-soaked lesions at the fruit and branch scars. These spots can get bigger and cause the death of the plant. The roots can be severely and rapidly infected, causing the plant to rapidly brown and wilt away collapsing within days. The most dangerous feature of the disease is the infection of the fruit because it cause harm to people who consume it. The biggest evidence that the fungus is present is the water-soaked marks that appear first along with the white fungus that grows on the dead fruit. After the fruit dies, it shrivels and falls to the ground.&#60;ref name=&#34;test&#34;/&#62;</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Pests">Pests</span></h4>
<p>The papaya fruit fly is mainly yellow with black marks.&#60;ref name=&#34;morton&#34;/&#62; The female papaya fruit fly has a very long, slender abdomen with an extended ovipositor that exceeds the length of its body. The male papaya fruit fly looks like the female with the differences of a hairy abdomen and no ovipositor. Long, slender eggs are laid inside of the fruit by the female papaya fruit fly. The larvae are white and look very much like the regular fruit fly larvae. The female is capable of laying 100 or more eggs, and they are laid during the evening or early morning in groups of ten inside young fruit.  They usually hatch within 12 days of being in the fruit where they feed on the seeds and interior parts of the fruit. When the larvae mature (usually 16 days after being hatched) they eat their way out of the fruit, drop to the ground, and pupate just below the soil and emerge within one to two weeks as mature flies. The flesh of the papaya must be ripe for the fly to migrate towards the surface of the fruit because unripe papaya juice is fatal to them. The papaya will turn yellow and drop to the ground if it is infected by the papaya fruit fly.&#60;ref name=&#34;test&#34;/&#62;</p>
<p>The <a href="/Two-spotted_spider_mite" title="Two-spotted spider mite">two-spotted spider mite</a> is a 0.5-mm-long brown or orange-red or a green, greenish yellow translucent oval pest. They all have needle-like piercing-sucking mouthparts and feed by piercing the plant tissue with their mouthparts, usually on the underside of the plant. The spider mites spin fine threads of webbing on the host plant, and when they remove the sap, the mesophyll tissue collapses and a small chlorotic spot forms at the feeding sites. The leaves of the papaya fruit turn yellow, gray, or bronze. If the spider mites are not controlled, they can cause the death of the fruit.&#60;ref name=&#34;test&#34;&#62;{{cite web |url=<a class="external free" href="http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/pdffiles/PI/PI05300.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/pdffiles/PI/PI05300.pdf</a> |last1=Mossler |first1=M.A. |last2=Crane |first2=J. date= September 2002 |title= Florida crop/pest management profile: papaya }}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>The papaya whitefly lays yellow, oval eggs that appear dusted on the undersides of the leaves. They eat the papaya fruits leaves, therefore damaging the fruit. There, the eggs developed into flies in three stages called instars. The first instar has well-developed legs and is the only mobile immature life stage. The crawlers insert their mouthparts in the lower surfaces of the leaf when they find it suitable and usually do not move again in this stage. The next instars are flattened, oval, and scale-like. In the final stage, the pupal whiteflies are more convex, with large, conspicuously red eyes.&#60;ref name=&#34;test&#34;/&#62;</p>
