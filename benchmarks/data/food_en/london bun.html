<p>Formerly a popular tea time bun it is now somewhat neglected. Its nearest still popular equivalent is the <a href="/Bath_bun" title="Bath bun">Bath bun</a>. Neither should be confused with the finger bun, an elongated bun topped with white icing sugar, optionally with shredded or finely chopped coconut, and available with or without fruit (currants/sultanas). The finger bun is a popular lunchtime staple amongst Australian school children and with many bun aficiandos.</p>
