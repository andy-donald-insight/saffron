<p>According to the <a href="/USDA" title="USDA">USDA</a>&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.ams.usda.gov/nop/NOP/standards.html" rel="nofollow">National Organic Program (NOP) Standards</a>&#60;/ref&#62; rules passed on October 22, 2002, <a href="/Certified_organic" title="Certified organic">certified organic</a> beef must come from a fully verifiable production system that collects information on the history of every animal in the program, including its breed history, veterinary care, and feed. Further, to be certified as organic, all cattle should meet the following criteria:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Born and raised on certified organic pasture</li>
<li>Never receive antibiotics</li>
<li>Never receive growth-promoting hormones</li>
<li>Are fed only certified organic grains (corn is a grain) and grasses</li>
<li>Must have unrestricted outdoor access</li>
</ul>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Organic_vs._Natural">Organic vs. Natural</span></h2>
<p>With the arrival of the <a href="/Organic_food" title="Organic food">Organic</a> label, many people assumed that the terms “organic” and “natural” were interchangeable, failing to understand the strict regulations required to raise certified organic beef. The USDA defines “natural” beef as all meats raised for human consumption without additives and minimally processed. Natural Beef producers may choose not to use antibiotics or growth-promoting hormones, but there is no third-party verification system required by the USDA. Beef from feedlots can be labeled natural, according to the USDA’s definition.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture allows any fresh meat to be described as &#34;natural&#34; if it includes no artificial flavoring, coloring, preservative or any other artificial ingredients.  Minimally processed products, such as ground meat, also count as &#34;natural.&#34; {{citation needed|date=November 2013}} To be marketed as &#34;natural,&#34; the product can not contain any additives, such as monosodium glutamate or salt.{{fact|date=April 2015}}</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Grass-fed_or_Grain_finished.3F">Grass-fed or Grain finished?</span></h2>
<p>As organic cattle approach market weight, there are two feeding methods that producers most commonly use to deliver beef products to their customers: Grass-Fed and Grain-Fed. In the grass-fed program, the cattle continue to eat certified organic grass right up to the time of <a href="/Animal_slaughter" title="Animal slaughter">slaughtering</a>. The USDA is currently developing guidelines to define the term Grass-Fed, and it is expected to call for an all grass diet of at least 95%. Strictly grass-fed cattle tend to be leaner than grain-fed. Grain finishing produces cattle with a higher percentage of fat. All grains must be certified organic to ensure the integrity of the program.</p>
