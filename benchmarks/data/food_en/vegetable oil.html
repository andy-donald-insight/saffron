<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Culinary_uses">Culinary uses</span></h3>
<p>{{See also|Cooking oil}}</p>
<p>Many vegetable oils are consumed directly, or indirectly as ingredients in food – a role that they share with some <a href="/Fat" title="Fat">animal fats</a>, including <a href="/Butter" title="Butter">butter</a> and <a href="/Ghee" title="Ghee">ghee</a>. The oils serve a number of purposes in this role:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Shortening – to give pastry a crumbly texture.</li>
<li>Texture – oils can serve to make other ingredients stick together less.</li>
<li>Flavor – while less-flavorful oils command premium prices{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}, some oils, such as <a href="/Olive_oil" title="Olive oil">olive</a>, <a href="/Sesame_oil" title="Sesame oil">sesame</a>, or <a href="/Almond_oil" title="Almond oil">almond</a> oil, may be chosen specifically for the flavor they impart.</li>
<li>Flavor base – oils can also &#34;carry&#34; flavors of other ingredients, since many flavors are present in chemicals that are soluble in oil.</li>
</ul>

<p>Secondly, oils can be heated and used to cook other foods. Oils suitable for this objective must have a high <a href="/Flash_point" title="Flash point">flash point</a>. Such oils include the major cooking oils – <a href="/Soybean_oil" title="Soybean oil">soybean</a>, <a href="/Canola_oil" title="Canola oil">canola</a>, <a href="/Sunflower_oil" title="Sunflower oil">sunflower</a>, <a href="/Safflower_oil" title="Safflower oil">safflower</a>, <a href="/Peanut_oil" title="Peanut oil">peanut</a>, <a href="/Cottonseed_oil" title="Cottonseed oil">cottonseed</a>, etc. Tropical oils, such as <a href="/Coconut_oil" title="Coconut oil">coconut</a>, <a href="/Palm_oil" title="Palm oil">palm</a>, and <a href="/Rice_bran_oil" title="Rice bran oil">rice bran</a> oils, are particularly valued in Asian cultures for high-temperature cooking, because of their unusually high flash points.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Hydrogenated_oils">Hydrogenated oils</span></h3>
<p>Unsaturated vegetable oils can be transformed through partial or complete &#34;<a href="/Hydrogenation" title="Hydrogenation">hydrogenation</a>&#34; into oils of higher melting point. The <a href="/Hydrogenation" title="Hydrogenation">hydrogenation</a> process involves &#34;<a href="/Sparging_(chemistry)" title="Sparging (chemistry)">sparging</a>&#34; the oil at high temperature and pressure with <a href="/Hydrogen" title="Hydrogen">hydrogen</a> in the presence of a <a href="/Catalyst" title="Catalyst">catalyst</a>, typically a powdered <a href="/Nickel" title="Nickel">nickel</a> compound. As each carbon–carbon double-bond is chemically reduced to a single bond, two hydrogen atoms each form single bonds with the two carbon atoms. The elimination of double bonds by adding hydrogen atoms is called <a href="/Saturated_fat" title="Saturated fat">saturation</a>; as the degree of saturation increases, the oil progresses toward being fully hydrogenated. An oil may be hydrogenated to increase resistance to <a href="/Rancidification" title="Rancidification">rancidity</a> (<a href="/Oxidation" title="Oxidation">oxidation</a>) or to change its physical characteristics. As the degree of saturation increases, the oil&#39;s viscosity and melting point increase.</p>
<p>The use of hydrogenated oils in foods has never been completely satisfactory. Because the center arm of the <a href="/Triglyceride" title="Triglyceride">triglyceride</a> is shielded somewhat by the end fatty acids, most of the hydrogenation occurs on the end fatty acids, thus making the resulting fat more brittle{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}. A margarine made from naturally more saturated oils will be more plastic (more &#34;spreadable&#34;) than a margarine made from hydrogenated soy oil{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}. While <i>full hydrogenation</i> produces largely saturated fatty acids, partial hydrogenation results in the transformation of unsaturated cis fatty acids to <a href="/Trans_fats" title="Trans fats">trans fatty acids</a> in the oil mixture due to the heat used in hydrogenation. Partially hydrogenated oils and their trans fats have been linked to an increased risk of mortality from <a href="/Coronary_heart_disease" title="Coronary heart disease">coronary heart disease</a>,&#60;ref name=TRANSformingApx9&#62;{{cite journal|author=Trans Fat Task Force|title=TRANSforming the Food Supply (Appendix 9iii)|date=June 2006|url=<a class="external free" href="http://wayback.archive.org/web/20070225021532/http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/nutrition/gras-trans-fats/tf-ge/tf-gt_app9iii_e.html" rel="nofollow">http://wayback.archive.org/web/20070225021532/http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/nutrition/gras-trans-fats/tf-ge/tf-gt_app9iii_e.html</a>|accessdate=2007-01-09}} (Consultation on the health implications of alternatives to trans fatty acids: Summary of Responses from Experts)&#60;/ref&#62; among other increased health risks.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Solvent_extraction">Solvent extraction</span></h3>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Hydrogenation">Hydrogenation</span></h3>

<p>Oils may be partially <a href="/Hydrogenation" title="Hydrogenation">hydrogenated</a> to produce various ingredient oils. Lightly hydrogenated oils have very similar physical characteristics to regular soy oil, but are more resistant to becoming rancid. <a href="/Margarine" title="Margarine">Margarine</a> oils need to be mostly solid at 32&#38;nbsp;°C (90&#38;nbsp;°F) so that the margarine does not melt in warm rooms, yet it needs to be completely liquid at 37&#38;nbsp;°C (98&#38;nbsp;°F), so that it doesn&#39;t leave a &#34;lardy&#34; taste in the mouth.</p>
<p>Hardening vegetable oil is done by raising a blend of vegetable oil and a catalyst in near-vacuum to very high temperatures, and introducing hydrogen. This causes the carbon atoms of the oil to break double-bonds with other carbons, each carbon forming a new single-bond with a hydrogen atom. Adding these hydrogen atoms to the oil makes it more solid, raises the <a href="/Smoke_point" title="Smoke point">smoke point</a>, and makes the oil more stable.</p>
<p>Hydrogenated vegetable oils differ in two major ways from other oils which are equally saturated. During hydrogenation, it is easier for hydrogen to come into contact with the fatty acids on the end of the triglyceride, and less easy for them to come into contact with the center fatty acid. This makes the resulting fat more brittle than a tropical oil; soy margarines are less &#34;spreadable&#34; {{compared to?|date=February 2013}}. The other difference is that trans fatty acids (often called <a href="/Trans_fat" title="Trans fat">trans fat</a>) are formed in the hydrogenation reactor, and may amount to as much as 40 percent by weight of a partially hydrogenated oil. Hydrogenated oils, especially partially hydrogenated oils with their higher amounts of trans fatty acids are increasingly thought to be unhealthy.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Deodorization">Deodorization</span></h3>
<p>In the processing of edible oils, the oil is heated under vacuum to near the smoke point, and water is introduced at the bottom of the oil. The water immediately is converted to steam, which bubbles through the oil, carrying with it any chemicals which are water-soluble. The steam sparging removes impurities that can impart unwanted flavors and odors to the oil. Deodorization is key to the manufacture of vegetable oils. Nearly all soybean, corn, and canola oils found on supermarket shelves go through a deodorization stage that removes trace amounts of odors and flavors, and lightens the color of the oil.</p>

<p>}}&#60;/ref&#62; By the 1950s and 1960s, soybean oil had become the most popular vegetable oil in the US.</p>
<p>In the mid-1970s, Canadian researchers developed a low-erucic-acid rapeseed cultivar. Because the word &#34;rape&#34; was not considered optimal for marketing, they coined the name &#34;canola&#34; (from &#34;Canada Oil low acid&#34;). The U.S. <a href="/Food_and_Drug_Administration" title="Food and Drug Administration">Food and Drug Administration</a> approved use of the canola name in January 1985,&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/ANSWERS/ANS00198.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/ANSWERS/ANS00198.html</a>|title=Canola oil|accessdate=2006-07-31 |archiveurl = <a class="external free" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060617234030/http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/ANSWERS/ANS00198.html" rel="nofollow">http://web.archive.org/web/20060617234030/http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/ANSWERS/ANS00198.html</a> &#60;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&#62; |archivedate = 2006-06-17}}&#60;/ref&#62; and U.S. farmers started planting large areas that spring. Canola oil is lower in saturated fats, and higher in monounsaturates and is a better source of <a href="/Omega-3" title="Omega-3">omega-3</a> fats than other popular oils. Canola is very thin (unlike corn oil) and flavorless (unlike olive oil), so it largely succeeds by displacing soy oil, just as soy oil largely succeeded by displacing cottonseed oil.</p>
