<p>The recipe for hot dry noodles is different from cold noodles and noodles in soup. Firstly mix the cooked noodles with oil and dry them. When they are about to be eaten, scald the prepared noodles in boiled water, mix them with condiments, and the noodles will be ready to eat. The finished hot dry noodles are firm and chewy, golden and oily, savory and fresh. It is made of  noodles called <i>jianmian</i> (碱面) with a mixture of sauces and dried vegetables. Many stalls that make reganmian will have their own variations in seasoning, creating signature tastes for individual stands or localities.</p>
<p>Reganmian restaurants stand all over the city. Among them, Cai Lin Ji is the most time-honored.

<p>In the early 1930s, there was a small restaurant operated by Bao Li, who made a living by selling bean noodles and noodle soup near a temple in Hankou. One day, by accident, he spilt sesame oil onto his noodles. The next day, he eventually boiled those noodles and added shallot and other condiments. Next morning, his noodles soon became very popular because of its unique taste. Many people ask Bao Li what kind of noodle it is, Bao Li answered: Hot dry noodles.&#60;ref&#62;
