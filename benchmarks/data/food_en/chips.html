<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Synopsis">Synopsis</span></h2>
<p><i>CHiPs</i> was a lightweight action crime drama, which included elements of light comedy in every episode. Over-the-top freeway <a href="/Pileup" title="Pileup">pileups</a>, which occurred in almost every episode were a signature of the show. There was little if any actual violence on <i>CHiPs</i> and the show can be classified as a light <a href="/Drama" title="Drama">drama</a>. The episodes filled a standard hour-long time slot, which at the time required 48 minutes of actual programming. For filming, traffic on Los Angeles freeways was non-existent and most chase scenes were done on back roads, usually dirt roads.</p>
<p>The show was created by <a href="/Rick_Rosner" title="Rick Rosner">Rick Rosner</a>, and starred <a href="/Erik_Estrada" title="Erik Estrada">Erik Estrada</a> as macho, rambunctious Officer Francis (&#34;Frank&#34;) Llewellyn &#34;Ponch&#34; Poncherello and <a href="/Larry_Wilcox" title="Larry Wilcox">Larry Wilcox</a> as his straitlaced partner, Officer Jonathan &#34;Jon&#34; Baker. With Ponch the more trouble-prone of the pair, and Jon generally the more level-headed one trying to keep him out of trouble with the duo&#39;s gruff yet fatherly commanding officer Sergeant Joseph Getraer (<a href="/Robert_Pine" title="Robert Pine">Robert Pine</a>), the two were Highway Patrolmen of the Central Los Angeles office of the <a href="/California_Highway_Patrol" title="California Highway Patrol">California Highway Patrol</a> (CHP, hence the name <i>CHiPs</i>).</p>
<p>As real-life CHP motor officers rarely ride in pairs, in early episodes this was explained away by placing the trouble-prone Ponch on probationary status, with Jon assigned as his field training officer. Eventually, by the end of the first season, this subplot faded away (Ponch completed his probation) as audiences were used to seeing the two working as a team.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="A_typical_CHiPs_episode">A typical <i>CHiPs</i> episode</span></h3>
<p>{{See also|List of CHiPs episodes}}
<i>CHiPs</i> episodes were usually a combination of light comedy and <a href="/Melodrama" title="Melodrama">melodrama</a>. A typical episode would start with Ponch and Jon on routine patrol or being assigned to an interesting beat, such as <a href="/Malibu%2C_California" title="Malibu, California">Malibu</a> or the <a href="/Sunset_Strip" title="Sunset Strip">Sunset Strip</a>. In roll call briefing, Sgt. Getraer would alert his officers to be on the lookout for a particular criminal operation, such as people staging accidents as part of an insurance scam or punks breaking into cars. A few interesting, unrelated <a href="/Vignette_(literature)" title="Vignette (literature)">vignettes</a> often transpired during &#34;routine&#34; traffic enforcement.</p>
<p>A light-hearted subplot would also be included, such as Harlan trying to hide a stray dog from Getraer at the office. A more serious theme, such as Ponch trying to keep a kid from his old neighborhood out of a potential life of crime, might also be included. After a few failed attempts to apprehend the gang that had been menacing L.A.&#39;s freeways, the episode would invariably culminate in Ponch and Jon leading a chase of the suspects (often assisted by other members of their division), climaxing with a spectacular series of stunt vehicle crashes.</p>
<p>The show then typically featured a <a href="/D%C3%A9nouement" title="Dénouement">dénouement</a> of Ponch and Jon participating in a new activity (such as <a href="/Jet_Ski" title="Jet Ski">jet skiing</a> or <a href="/Skydiving" title="Skydiving">skydiving</a>), designed to showcase the pair&#39;s glamorous <a href="/Southern_California" title="Southern California">Southern California</a> lifestyle. Often, Ponch would attempt to impress a woman he had met during the episode with his athletic prowess or disco dancing, only to fail and provide Jon, Getraer, and others with many laughs. As the preliminary end credits would start, the image would freeze multiple times, showing various characters laughing or otherwise enjoying the social scene.</p>
<p>Some of the more outlandish plots included Ponch and his Season 6 partner Bobby Nelson helping a girl who believed that she was being targeted by UFOs and them racing against time to defuse a battery about to explode on an intelligent experimental police robot.</p>
<p>CHP Officers rarely drew their guns in the series; in the TV Movie however, guns were used more prominently, especially in one of the final scenes in which Jon and McFall are held hostage on a tour bus, the entire CHP are shown holding guns at the bus.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Production">Production</span></h2>
<p>According to a 1998 <i><a href="/TV_Guide" title="TV Guide">TV Guide</a></i> article, show creator Rick Rosner was a reserve deputy with the <a href="/Los_Angeles_County_Sheriff&#39;s_Department" title="Los Angeles County Sheriff&#39;s Department">Los Angeles County Sheriff&#39;s Department</a>. During a coffee break on an evening patrol shift in the mid-1970s he saw two young CHP officers on motorcycles which gave him the idea for this series. He later created <i><a href="/240-Robert" title="240-Robert">240-Robert</a></i>, which seemed like a hybrid of <i>CHiPs</i> and <i><a href="/Emergency!" title="Emergency!">Emergency!</a></i>.

<p>
Episodes occasionally reference Jon Baker&#39;s service in <a href="/Vietnam_War" title="Vietnam War">Vietnam</a>. This makes his character one of the earliest regular (and one of the more positive) portrayals of a <a href="/Vietnam_veteran" title="Vietnam veteran">Vietnam veteran</a> on television. Larry Wilcox served 13 months in Vietnam as a <a href="/United_States_Marine_Corps" title="United States Marine Corps">Marine</a> artilleryman.</p>
<p>Though public perception links the later <i>P-Series</i> <a href="/Kawasaki_police_motorcycles" title="Kawasaki police motorcycles">Kawasaki Police Special</a> with the series, in fact they rode the <i>C-Series</i> Kawasaki, which had an oval windshield rather than the later model&#39;s fiberglass fairing.</p>
<p>Despite the <a href="/Ford_Motor_Company" title="Ford Motor Company">Ford Motor Company</a>&#39;s credit as a vehicle provider for nearly 4 of the series&#39; 6 seasons, cars and trucks were supplied by several manufacturers; many of the police cars seen were <a href="/Dodge" title="Dodge">Dodge</a> models.</p>
<p>Filming locations were generally in the <a href="/San_Fernando_Valley" title="San Fernando Valley">San Fernando Valley</a> of California. Freeway crashes were performed on recently constructed highways that were not yet open to the public. For the first season, the Glendale Freeway (<a href="/California_State_Route_2" title="California State Route 2">Highway 2</a>) in <a href="/Montrose%2C_California" title="Montrose, California">Montrose, California</a> was used. After the first season, the intersection of the Foothill Freeway (<a href="/Interstate_210_(California)" title="Interstate 210 (California)">Interstate 210</a>) and the Simi Valley Freeway (<a href="/California_State_Route_118" title="California State Route 118">Highway 118</a>) in <a href="/Sylmar%2C_California" title="Sylmar, California">Sylmar, California</a> were used. For the racing scenes in the episode &#34;Drive, Lady, Drive&#34; they used the <a href="/Riverside_International_Raceway" title="Riverside International Raceway">Riverside International Raceway</a> in <a href="/Riverside%2C_California" title="Riverside, California">Riverside, California</a>.</p>
<p>Although doubles were used for far-off shots and various stunt or action sequences, Wilcox and Estrada did a great deal of their own motorcycle riding, and performed many smaller stunts themselves. Although Wilcox emerged relatively injury-free, Estrada suffered various injuries several times throughout the run of the series. In several early first season episodes, a huge bruise or scar can be seen on his arm after he was flung from one of the motorcycles and skidded along the ground. But his worst accident came when he was seriously injured in a motorcycle accident while filming a season three episode in August 1979, fracturing several ribs and breaking both wrists. The accident and Estrada&#39;s subsequent hospitalization was incorporated into the series&#39; storyline.</p>
<p>Prior to being cast in <i>CHiPs</i> Estrada had no experience with motorcycles, so he underwent an intensive eight-week course, learning how to ride. In 2007 it was revealed that he did not hold a motorcycle license at the time <i>CHiPs</i> was in production, and only qualified for a license after three attempts, while preparing for an appearance on the reality television show <i>Back to the Grind</i>.</p>
<p>Estrada and Wilcox never drew their firearms over the course of the series. (This did occur in the made-for-TV reunion movie <i><a href="/CHiPs_&#39;99" title="CHiPs &#39;99">CHiPs &#39;99</a></i>.) The only character on the series depicted as drawing his firearm was Baricza (Brodie Greer), and he did so three times. The first was his radio car&#39;s <a href="/Ithaca_37" title="Ithaca 37">Ithaca 37</a> shotgun in season 1&#39;s episode &#34;Rainy Day&#34;,&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.chips-tv.com/Guide/Episode/120.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.chips-tv.com/Guide/Episode/120.shtml</a>|publisher=CHiPs-TV.com|title=Episode Guide, Episode 120|accessdate=June 30, 2006}}&#60;/ref&#62; where the CHiPs conduct a felony traffic stop of a motorhome-based casino.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web |url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.chips-tv.com/Guide/Episode/416.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.chips-tv.com/Guide/Episode/416.shtml</a>|publisher=CHiPs-TV.com|title=Episode Guide, Episode 416|accessdate=June 30, 2006}}&#60;/ref&#62; The second was in season 2&#39;s premiere, &#34;Peaks and Valleys&#34;, against two hillbillies armed with a Tommy-gun and a double-barrel shotgun who had ambushed his unattended patrol car for fun. Here the action was only implied, with his hand motion just below camera range. The last was in season 4&#39;s &#34;Karate&#34;, in which a karate-trained car burglar (<a href="/Danny_Bonaduce" title="Danny Bonaduce">Danny Bonaduce</a>) attacked him with a <i><a href="/B%C5%8D" title="Bō">Bō</a></i>, but Baricza drew his gun to stop Bonaduce.</p>
<p><a href="/NBC" title="NBC">NBC</a> aired reruns of this series on its 1982 daytime schedule from April to September.</p>
<p>During the original run of the series, syndicated <a href="/Rerun" title="Rerun">reruns</a> of older episodes were retitled <i>CHiPs Patrol</i> to avoid confusion.&#60;ref&#62;{{Cite journal|journal=Journal of the Audio Engineering Society|page=190|publisher=<a href="/Audio_Engineering_Society" title="Audio Engineering Society">Audio Engineering Society</a>|date=March 1986|postscript=&#60;!--None--&#62;}}&#60;/ref&#62; Later syndicated reruns after the show went out of production reverted to the original title.</p>

The season 6 episode &#34;Speedway Fever&#34; (aired November 7, 1982) centered on Penhall&#39;s character Nelson winning the 1982 Speedway World Final at the <a href="/Los_Angeles_Memorial_Coliseum" title="Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum">Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum</a>, with scenes filmed in the pits during the meeting. The episode also used television coverage of the final (with dubbed commentary). Penhall later admitted that having a bodyguard and having to have makeup done in the pits in full view of his competitors at the World Final only added to the pressure he was under both as a rider and a rookie actor and that it felt weird having to &#34;buddy up to Ponch&#34; in front of the other riders while the World Final was taking place. In order to become a full-time member of the <i>CHiPs</i> cast, Penhall had officially announced his retirement from speedway racing on the podium of the 1982 World Final.</p>
<p>Estrada apparently did not approve of Reilly&#39;s work ethic and was very displeased with Reilly&#39;s real life arrest by the <a href="/Los_Angeles_Police_Department" title="Los Angeles Police Department">LAPD</a> for possession of controlled substances during a traffic stop. As a result, Bobby was featured much less prominently in later episodes of the season, with Bruce{{clarify|date=June 2015}} taking his place for most of the remaining episodes.</p>
