Lardy cakes are very rich and sweet and eaten traditionally for special occasions, high days and holidays and harvest festivals.</p>
<p>The cake is made by layering thinly rolled dough with the other ingredients.  As reported by the author <a href="/Elizabeth_David" title="Elizabeth David">Elizabeth David</a>, a <a href="/Hampshire" title="Hampshire">Hampshire</a> <a href="/Cookbook" title="Cookbook">cookbook</a> advises that the cake be turned upside down after <a href="/Baking" title="Baking">baking</a> &#34;so the lard can soak through.&#34; It is theoretically possible to substitute <a href="/Butter" title="Butter">butter</a> for lard, but as Elizabeth David puts it: &#34;How could they be Lardy cakes without lard?&#34;. (<i>English Bread and Yeast Cookery </i>1994 ed. Pg 462, footnote)</p>
<p>A variation of the lardy cake is the <a href="/Dripping_cake" title="Dripping cake">dripping cake</a>.</p>
<p>There is some dispute as to which area of England recorded the original recipe.  In Hampshire a form of the cake was made without currants&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.hub-uk.com/tallyrecip03/recipe0117.htm" rel="nofollow">Lardy Cake Recipe - Recipes by Tallyrand</a>&#60;/ref&#62; and it can still be bought in the county and neighbouring <a href="/Sussex" title="Sussex">Sussex</a>.  Versions of the cake are also baked in the <a href="/West_Country" title="West Country">West Country</a> particularly in <a href="/Gloucestershire" title="Gloucestershire">Gloucestershire</a>, <a href="/Wiltshire" title="Wiltshire">Wiltshire</a>.  These are areas of England where <a href="/Pig_farming" title="Pig farming">pig farming</a> (of which lard is a product) has traditionally been a mainstay of the agricultural economy.
