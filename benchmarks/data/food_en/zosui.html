<p><b>Zōsui</b> (雑炊) is a <a href="/Japan" title="Japan">Japanese</a> <a href="/Rice" title="Rice">rice</a> <a href="/Soup" title="Soup">soup</a> made from pre-cooked <a href="/Rice" title="Rice">rice</a> and water. <a href="/Okayu" title="Okayu">Okayu</a>, which is a similar dish to Zosui, is rice cooked to a watery consistency.</p>
<p>Zosui (which is also called ojiya) and <a href="/Okayu" title="Okayu">Okayu</a>, while similar, are two separate dishes. While the two dishes both contain rice, and both are traditionally eaten when people are feeling unwell, okayu is a kind of porridge (similar to oatmeal), while zosui is akin to a vegetable soup with lots of rice.</p>
<p>Leftover soup from <a href="/Nabemono" title="Nabemono">nabe</a> is often re-used for zosui. Instead of rice, <a href="/Udon" title="Udon">udon</a> and <a href="/Ramen" title="Ramen">ramen</a> noodles are recent alternatives.</p>
