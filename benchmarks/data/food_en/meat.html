<p>Several economically important traits in meat animals are heritable to some degree (see the table to the right) and can thus be selected for by <a href="/Animal_breeding" title="Animal breeding">animal breeding</a>. In cattle, certain growth features are controlled by <a href="/Dominance_(genetics)" title="Dominance (genetics)">recessive genes</a> which have not so far been controlled, complicating breeding.&#60;ref name=&#34;Lawrie&#34; /&#62;{{rp|18}} One such trait is <a href="/Dwarfism" title="Dwarfism">dwarfism</a>; another is the doppelender or &#34;<a href="/Myostatin" title="Myostatin">double muscling</a>&#34; condition, which causes <a href="/Muscle_hypertrophy" title="Muscle hypertrophy">muscle hypertrophy</a> and thereby increases the animal&#39;s commercial value.&#60;ref name=&#34;Lawrie&#34; /&#62;{{rp|18}} <a href="/Genetic_analysis" title="Genetic analysis">Genetic analysis</a> continues to reveal the genetic mechanisms that control numerous aspects of the <a href="/Endocrine_system" title="Endocrine system">endocrine system</a> and, through it, meat growth and quality.&#60;ref name=&#34;Lawrie&#34; /&#62;{{rp|19}}</p>
<p><a href="/Genetic_engineering" title="Genetic engineering">Genetic engineering</a> techniques can shorten breeding programmes significantly because they allow for the identification and isolation of <a href="/Gene" title="Gene">genes</a> coding for desired traits, and for the reincorporation of these genes into the animal <a href="/Genome" title="Genome">genome</a>.&#60;ref name=&#34;Lawrie&#34; /&#62;{{rp|21}} To enable such manipulation, research is ongoing ({{as of|2006|lc=on}}) to <a href="/Genome_project" title="Genome project">map the entire genome</a> of sheep, cattle and pigs.&#60;ref name=&#34;Lawrie&#34; /&#62;{{rp|21}} Some research has already seen commercial application.

<p>Experimental <a href="/Reproductive_cloning" title="Reproductive cloning">reproductive cloning</a> of commercially important meat animals such as sheep, pig or cattle has been successful.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Environment">Environment</span></h3>
<p>Heat regulation in <a href="/Livestock" title="Livestock">livestock</a> is of great economic significance, because mammals attempt to maintain a constant optimal body temperature. Low temperatures tend to prolong animal development and high temperatures tend to retard it.&#60;ref name=&#34;Lawrie&#34; /&#62;{{rp|22}} Depending on their size, body shape and insulation through tissue and fur, some animals have a relatively narrow zone of temperature tolerance and others (e.g. cattle) a broad one.&#60;ref name=&#34;Lawrie&#34; /&#62;{{rp|23}} Static <a href="/Magnetic_field" title="Magnetic field">magnetic fields</a>, for reasons still unknown, also retard animal development.&#60;ref name=&#34;Lawrie&#34; /&#62;{{rp|23}}</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Nutrition">Nutrition</span></h3>
<p>The quality and quantity of usable meat depends on the animal&#39;s <i>plane of nutrition</i>, i.e., whether it is over- or underfed. Scientists disagree, however, about how exactly the plane of nutrition influences carcase composition.&#60;ref name=&#34;Lawrie&#34; /&#62;{{rp|25}}</p>

These include the treatment of feed with <a href="/Formalin" title="Formalin">formalin</a> to protect <a href="/Amino_acid" title="Amino acid">amino acids</a> during their passage through the <a href="/Rumen" title="Rumen">rumen</a>, the recycling of <a href="/Manure" title="Manure">manure</a> by feeding it back to cattle mixed with feed concentrates, or the partial conversion of <a href="/Petroleum" title="Petroleum">petroleum</a> <a href="/Hydrocarbon" title="Hydrocarbon">hydrocarbons</a> to protein through microbial action.&#60;ref name=&#34;Lawrie&#34; /&#62;{{rp|30}}</p>

Decades of breeding meat animals for fatness is being reversed by consumer demand for meat with less fat.The fatty deposits that exist with the muscle fibers in meats soften meat when it is cooked and improve the flavor through chemical changes initiated through heat that allow the protein and fat molecules to interact. The fat, when cooked with meat, also makes the meat seem juicier. However, the nutritional contribution of the fat is mainly calories as opposed to protein. As fat content rises, the meat&#39;s contribution to nutrition declines. In addition, there is <a href="/Cholesterol" title="Cholesterol">cholesterol</a> associated with fat surrounding the meat. The cholesterol is a lipid associated with the kind of saturated fat found in meat. The increase in meat consumption after 1960 is associated with, though not definitively the cause of, significant imbalances of fat and cholesterol in the human diet.&#60;ref&#62;Horowitz, Roger. &#34;Putting Meat on the American Table: Taste, Technology, Transformation&#34; The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2005 p. 4.&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>The table in this section compares the nutritional content of several types of meat. While each kind of meat has about the same content of protein and carbohydrates, there is a very wide range of fat content.</p>

<p>{{Main|Ethics of eating meat}}
Ethical issues regarding the consumption of meat can include objections to the act of killing animals or to the <a href="/Intensive_agriculture" title="Intensive agriculture">agricultural practices</a> used in meat production. Reasons for objecting to killing animals for consumption may include <a href="/Animal_rights" title="Animal rights">animal rights</a>, <a href="/Environmental_ethics" title="Environmental ethics">environmental ethics</a>, or an aversion to inflicting <a href="/Pain" title="Pain">pain</a> or harm on other <a href="/Sentience" title="Sentience">sentient creatures</a>. Some people, while not vegetarians, refuse to eat the flesh of certain animals, such as cows, pigs, cats, dogs, horses, or rabbits, due to cultural or religious traditions.</p>
<p>Some people eat only the flesh of animals which they believe have not been mistreated, and abstain from the meat of animals reared in <a href="/Factory_farming" title="Factory farming">factory farms</a> or from particular products such as <a href="/Foie_gras" title="Foie gras">foie gras</a> and <a href="/Veal" title="Veal">veal</a>. Some people also abstain from milk and its derivatives because the production of veal is a byproduct of the <a href="/Dairy_industry" title="Dairy industry">dairy industry</a>. The ethical issues with factory farming relate to the high concentration of animals, animal waste, and the potential for dead animals in a small space. Critics argue that some techniques used in intensive agriculture can be cruel to animals. Foie gras is a <a href="/Food_product" title="Food product">food product</a> made of the <a href="/Liver" title="Liver">liver</a> of <a href="/Domestic_duck" title="Domestic duck">ducks</a> or <a href="/Domestic_goose" title="Domestic goose">geese</a> that has been specially fattened by <a href="/Force_feeding" title="Force feeding">force feeding</a> them corn. Veal is criticised because the veal calves may be highly restricted in movement; have unsuitable flooring; spend their entire lives indoors; experience prolonged sensory, social, and exploratory deprivation; and are more susceptible to high amounts of stress and disease.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external free" href="http://www.hsus.org/farm/resources/research/welfare/welfare_veal_calves.html&#60;/ref&#38;gt" rel="nofollow">http://www.hsus.org/farm/resources/research/welfare/welfare_veal_calves.html&#60;/ref&#38;gt</a>;</p>

<p>Various environmental effects are associated with meat production. Among these are greenhouse gas emissions, fossil energy use, water use, water quality changes, and effects on grazed ecosystems.</p>
<p>The livestock sector may be the largest source of water pollution (due to animal wastes, fertilizers, pesticides), and it contributes to  emergence of antibiotic resistance. It accounts  for over 8% of global human water use. It is by far the biggest cause of land use, as it accounts for 30% of the global land surface. It is probably the leading player in biodiversity loss, as it causes deforestation, land degradation, pollution, overfishing, and invasions by alien species.&#60;ref&#62;August 2009. &#34;Livestock&#39;s Long Shadow – Environmental issues and options&#34;.
