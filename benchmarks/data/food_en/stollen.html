<p><b>Stollen</b> ({{IPA-de|ˈʃtɔln̩}}) is a <a href="/Fruit_cake" title="Fruit cake">fruit</a> bread containing <a href="/Dried_fruit" title="Dried fruit">dried fruit</a> and often  covered with <a href="/Powdered_sugar" title="Powdered sugar">powdered sugar</a> or <a href="/Icing_sugar" title="Icing sugar">icing sugar</a>. The bread is usually made with chopped candied fruit and/or dried fruit, nuts and spices. Stollen is a traditional <a href="/Germans" title="Germans">German</a> bread usually eaten during the <a href="/Christmas" title="Christmas">Christmas</a> season, when it is called <b>Weihnachtsstollen</b> (after &#34;<a href="/Weihnachten" title="Weihnachten">Weihnachten</a>&#34;) or <b>Christstollen</b> (after <a href="/Christ" title="Christ">Christ</a>) as well as <b>Winterbrot</b> (winter bread) when eaten during Jewish festivities, as it foreshadows the coming of winter.{{citation needed|reason=Winterbrot appears to have a broader definition than Stollen, and does not appear to be associated with a Jewish holiday|date=November 2015}}</p>
<p>Stollen is a cake like fruit bread made with yeast, water and flour, and usually with <a href="/Zest_(ingredient)" title="Zest (ingredient)">zest</a> added to the dough. Candied orange peel and candied citrus peel (Zitronat),&#60;ref&#62;<a href="/Duden" title="Duden">Duden</a>: Zi|tro|nat, das&#60;/ref&#62; <a href="/Raisin" title="Raisin">raisins</a> and <a href="/Almond" title="Almond">almonds</a>, and different spices such as <a href="/Cardamom" title="Cardamom">cardamom</a> and <a href="/Cinnamon" title="Cinnamon">cinnamon</a> are added. Other ingredients, such as milk, sugar, butter, salt, rum, eggs,&#60;ref&#62;[Recipe for Dresdner Weihnachtsstollen Mimi Sheraton, The German Cookbook, from Random House]&#60;/ref&#62; vanilla,&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://german.about.com/library/blrezepte02b.htm" rel="nofollow">Dresden Christmas Bread</a>&#60;/ref&#62; other <a href="/Dried_fruit" title="Dried fruit">dried fruits</a> and nuts and <a href="/Marzipan" title="Marzipan">marzipan</a> may also be added to the dough.
Except for the fruit added, the dough is quite low in sugar. The finished bread is sprinkled with icing sugar. The traditional weight of Stollen is around {{convert|4.4|kg|abbr=on}}, but smaller sizes are now available.
Stollen is like regular sweetened fruit bread. However, because it is slathered with melted unsalted butter and rolled in sugar as soon as it comes out of the oven, it results in a much better-keeping and moister product. The marzipan rope in the middle is optional. The dried fruits are macerated in rum or brandy for a superior tasting bread.</p>
<p>Dresden Stollen (originally <a href="/Striezel" title="Striezel">Striezel</a>), a moist, heavy bread filled with fruit, was first mentioned in an official document in 1474,&#60;ref name=&#34;www.dresden.de&#34;&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.dresden.de/dwt/en/press_service/press_texts_in_various_languages/english/c_33_recipes_for_dresden_christstollen.php" rel="nofollow">www.dresden.de</a>&#60;/ref&#62; and <i>Dresdner Stollen</i> remains notable&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://lexikon.meyers.de/meyers/Stollen" rel="nofollow">Meyers Lexikon</a>: &#34;Besonders bekannt ist der Dresdner Stollen&#34; (&#34;the <i>Dresden Stollen</i> is especially well-known&#34;)&#60;/ref&#62; and available - amongst other places - at the <a href="/Dresden" title="Dresden">Dresden</a> Christmas market, the <a href="/Striezelmarkt" title="Striezelmarkt">Striezelmarkt</a>.

Early Stollen was different, the ingredients were very different - flour, oats and water.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.medgesch.uni-hd.de/PDF/WH-476.pdf" rel="nofollow">Von Gänsen, Karpfen, Lebkuchen und Stollen</a> Dtsch Med.

<p>As a Christmas bread stollen was baked for the first time at the <a href="/Council_of_Trent" title="Council of Trent">Council of Trent</a> in 1545,&#60;ref name=&#34;Stollen history&#34;&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.stollen-online.de/dresdnerstollen/geschichte-eng.htm" rel="nofollow">Stollen history</a>&#60;/ref&#62; and was made with flour, yeast, oil and water.</p>
<p>The <a href="/Advent" title="Advent">Advent</a> season was a time of fasting, and bakers were not allowed to use butter, only oil, and the cake was tasteless and hard.&#60;ref name=&#34;www.dresden.de&#34;/&#62;</p>
<p>In the 15th century, in medieval Saxony (in central Germany, north of Bavaria and south of Brandenburg), the <a href="/Prince_Elector" title="Prince Elector">Prince Elector</a> <a href="/Ernst%2C_Elector_of_Saxony" title="Ernst, Elector of Saxony">Ernst</a> (1441–1486) and his brother <a href="/Duke" title="Duke">Duke</a> <a href="/Albert%2C_Duke_of_Saxony" title="Albert, Duke of Saxony">Albrecht</a> (1443–1500) decided to remedy this by writing to the <a href="/Pope" title="Pope">Pope</a> in <a href="/Rome" title="Rome">Rome</a>. The <a href="/Saxony" title="Saxony">Saxon</a> bakers needed to use butter, as oil in Saxony was expensive, hard to come by, and had to be made from turnips.</p>
<p><a href="/Pope_Nicholas_V" title="Pope Nicholas V">Pope Nicholas V</a> (1397–1455), in 1450 {{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}denied the first appeal.

<p>Others were also permitted to use butter, but on the condition of having to pay annually 1/20th of a gold Gulden to support the building of the <a href="/Freiberg" title="Freiberg">Freiberg</a> Minster. The ban on butter was removed when <a href="/Saxony" title="Saxony">Saxony</a> became <a href="/Protestant" title="Protestant">Protestant</a>.</p>
<p>Over the centuries, the bread  changed from being a simple, fairly tasteless &#34;bread&#34; to a sweeter bread with richer ingredients, such as <a href="/Marzipan" title="Marzipan">marzipan</a>, although traditional Stollen is not as sweet, light and airy as the copies made around the world.</p>

<p>Every year Stollenfest takes place in Dresden. This historical tradition ended only in 1918 with the fall of the monarchy,&#60;ref name=&#34;Stollen history&#34;/&#62; and started again in 1994, but the idea comes from Dresden’s history.</p>
<p>Dresden’s Christmas market, the <a href="/Striezelmarkt" title="Striezelmarkt">Striezelmarkt</a>, was mentioned in the chronicles for the first time in 1474.&#60;ref name=&#34;Stollen history&#34;/&#62;&#60;!--Dresden.de gives 1434 as the date--&#62;</p>
<p>The tradition of baking Christmas Stollen in Dresden is very old. Christmas Stollen in Dresden was already baked in the 15th century.&#60;ref&#62;{{Cite book|title = German Cuisine, Past and Present|last = Kagachi|first = Chihiro|publisher = |year = 1958|<a class="external text" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/">isbn </a>= |location = |pages = }}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>In 1560, the bakers of Dresden offered the rulers of Saxony Christmas Stollen weighing 36&#38;nbsp;pounds each as gift, and the custom continued.&#60;ref name=&#34;Stollen history&#34;/&#62;</p>
<p><a href="/Augustus_II_the_Strong" title="Augustus II the Strong">Augustus II the Strong</a> (1670–1733) was the Elector of Saxony, King of Poland and the <a href="/Grand_Duke_of_Lithuania" title="Grand Duke of Lithuania">Grand Duke of Lithuania</a>.
The King loved pomp, luxury, splendour and feasts. In 1730, he impressed his subjects, ordering the Bakers’ Guild of Dresden to make a giant 1.7-tonne Stollen, big enough for everyone to have a portion to eat. There were around  24,000 guests who were taking part in the festivities on the occasion of the legendary amusement festivity known as Zeithainer Lustlager.&#60;ref name=&#34;Stollen history&#34;/&#62; For this special occasion, the  court architect <a href="/Matth%C3%A4us_Daniel_P%C3%B6ppelmann" title="Matthäus Daniel Pöppelmann">Matthäus Daniel Pöppelmann</a> (1662–1737), built a particularly oversized Stollen oven.&#60;ref name=&#34;Stollen history&#34;/&#62; An oversized Stollen knife also had been designed solely for this occasion.&#60;ref name=&#34;Stollen knife&#34;&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.stollenfest.com/knife.php" rel="nofollow">Stollen knife</a>&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>Today, the festival takes place on the Saturday before the second Sunday in Advent, and the cake weighs between three and four tonnes. A carriage takes the cake in a parade through the streets of <a href="/Dresden" title="Dresden">Dresden</a> to the Christmas market, where it is ceremoniously cut into pieces and distributed among the crowd, for a small sum which goes to charity. A special knife, the Grand Dresden Stollen Knife, a silver-plated knife, 1.60&#38;nbsp;meters long weighing 12&#38;nbsp;kg, which is a copy of the lost baroque original knife from 1730, is used to festively cut the oversize Stollen at the Dresden Christmas fair.&#60;ref name=&#34;Stollen knife&#34;/&#62;</p>
<p>The largest Stollen was baked in 2010 by <a href="/Lidl" title="Lidl">Lidl</a>; it was 72.1&#38;nbsp;meters long and was certified by the <a href="/Guinness_Book_of_World_Records" title="Guinness Book of World Records">Guinness Book of World Records</a>, at the train station of <a href="/Haarlem" title="Haarlem">Haarlem</a>.&#60;ref&#62;&#34;<a class="external autonumber" href="http://www.sevendays.nl/artikel/184616" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>,&#34; <i>Biggest stollen Haarlem</i>.&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
