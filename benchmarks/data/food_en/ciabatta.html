<p>Ciabatta was first produced in 1982 by Arnaldo Cavallari, a <a href="/Baker" title="Baker">baker</a> and <a href="/Miller" title="Miller">miller</a> from <a href="/Adria" title="Adria">Adria</a>, a small town close to <a href="/Venice" title="Venice">Venice</a> in <a href="/Veneto" title="Veneto">Veneto</a>.&#60;ref name=&#34;Oxford Companion&#34;&#62;{{cite book|title=The Oxford Companion to Italian Food|accessdate=20 January 2015|last=Riley|first=Gillian|page=129|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, UK|year=2007|isbn=9780198606178}}&#60;/ref&#62; Francesco Favaron of Pan Technology maintains that he personally invented this bread.  Pan Technology is a private school devoted to bread, pizza, and pastry, that is located in the Veneto region of Italy. Mr. Favaron states that he developed <i>ciabatta</i> in the 1960s by experimenting for two years when working in the city of Milan. The manual produced by Pan Technology includes 1028 formulae for Italian regional breads, one of which, it is claimed, is the &#34;original&#34; <i>ciabatta</i> formula.&#60;ref&#62;{{Cite web|title = Ciabatta Bread Suite|url = <a class="external free" href="http://www.theartisan.net/Ciabatta_Suite_Frameset.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.theartisan.net/Ciabatta_Suite_Frameset.htm</a>|website = www.theartisan.net|accessdate = 2015-09-20}}&#60;/ref&#62;  Cavallari and other bakers in Italy were concerned by the popularity of sandwiches made from baguettes imported from France, which were endangering their businesses, so set about trying to create an Italian alternative with which to make sandwiches. The recipe for ciabatta came about after several weeks trying variations of traditional bread recipes, and consists of a soft, wet dough made with high <a href="/Gluten" title="Gluten">gluten</a> flour.&#60;ref name=&#39;Guardian-1999-1&#39;&#62;{{cite news | first = Robin | last = Stummer | title = The secret life of ciabatta | date = 30 April 1999 | url = <a class="external free" href="http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/1999/apr/30/features11.g24" rel="nofollow">http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/1999/apr/30/features11.g24</a> | work = <a href="/The_Guardian" title="The Guardian">The Guardian</a> | accessdate = 13 December 2013}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>Cavallari called the bread <i>ciabatta Polesano</i> after <a href="/Polesine" title="Polesine">Polesine</a>, the area he lived in, and registered it as a trademark. The recipe was subsequently licensed by Cavallari&#39;s company, Molini Adriesi, to bakers in 11 countries by 1999.&#60;ref name=&#39;Guardian-1999-1&#39;/&#62;</p>
<p>Many regions have their own variations on the original recipe or a bread which closely resembles ciabatta, and which has become accepted as a variety of ciabatta; the ciabatta from the area encompassing <a href="/Lake_Como" title="Lake Como">Lake Como</a> has a crisp crust, a somewhat soft, porous texture, and is light to the touch.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} The ciabatta found in <a href="/Tuscany" title="Tuscany">Tuscany</a>, <a href="/Umbria" title="Umbria">Umbria</a>, and <a href="/Marche" title="Marche">Marche</a> varies from bread that has a firm crust and dense crumb, to bread that has a crisper crust and more open texture, and in <a href="/Rome" title="Rome">Rome</a>, it is often seasoned with <a href="/Marjoram" title="Marjoram">marjoram</a>.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}</p>
<p>New variations of the recipe continue to be developed. Wholemeal ciabatta are known as <i>ciabatta integrale</i>, and when <a href="/Milk" title="Milk">milk</a> is added to the <a href="/Dough" title="Dough">dough</a>, it becomes <i>ciabatta al latte</i>.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}</p>

<p>Ciabatta bread was introduced to the United Kingdom in 1985 by Marks &#38; Spencer, then brought to the US in 1987 by Orlando Bakery, a <a href="/Cleveland" title="Cleveland">Cleveland</a> firm.&#60;ref name=&#39;Guardian-1999-1&#39; /&#62;&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external autonumber" href="http://www.orlandobaking.com/index.php?location=OBC/history" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>{{dead link|date=April 2015}}&#60;/ref&#62;  They brought over three bakers from Italy to develop the product and adapt it to <a href="/Mass_production" title="Mass production">mass production</a>.  They successfully introduced a fresh bread, then later, a frozen version.  It was quickly copied throughout the United States and became widely available in Australia around this time, due to the large <a href="/Italian_Australian" title="Italian Australian">Italian Australian</a> population.</p>
<p>The more open-crumbed form, which is usual in the United States, is made from a very wet dough, often requiring machine-kneading, and a <a href="/Biga_(bread_baking)" title="Biga (bread baking)">biga</a> or <a href="/Sourdough" title="Sourdough">sourdough</a> <a href="/Pre-ferment" title="Pre-ferment">starter</a>.</p>
