<b>Evaporated milk</b>, also known as dehydrated milk, is a <a href="/Shelf_stable_food" title="Shelf stable food">shelf-stable</a> canned <a href="/Milk" title="Milk">milk</a> product with about 60% of the water removed from fresh milk. It differs from sweetened <a href="/Condensed_milk" title="Condensed milk">condensed milk</a>, which contains added sugar.  Sweetened condensed milk requires less processing since the added sugar inhibits&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|title=How does sugar act as a preservative?|url=<a class="external free" href="http://sciencefocus.com/qa/how-does-sugar-act-preservative" rel="nofollow">http://sciencefocus.com/qa/how-does-sugar-act-preservative</a>|publisher=BBC Worldwide}}&#60;/ref&#62;  bacterial growth.</p>
<p>The product takes up half the space of its nutritional equivalent in fresh milk. When the liquid product is mixed with a proportionate amount of water, evaporated milk becomes the rough equivalent of fresh milk. This makes evaporated milk attractive for shipping purposes as it can have a shelf life of months or even years, depending upon the fat and sugar content. This made evaporated milk very popular before refrigeration as a safe and reliable substitute for perishable fresh milk, which could be shipped easily to locations lacking the means of safe milk production or storage. Households in the western world use it most often today for <a href="/Dessert" title="Dessert">desserts</a> and baking due to its unique flavor. It is also used as a substitute for pouring cream, as an accompaniment to desserts, or (undiluted) as a rich substitute for milk.  Mashed potatoes can be made by adding evaporated milk to (typically peeled) boiled potatoes, and whipping them into a creamy food.</p>
<p>The process involves the evaporation of about half the water from the milk, after which the product is homogenized, canned, and sterilized.&#60;ref&#62;{{Cite book</p>

In the 1920s and 1930s, evaporated milk began to be widely commercially available at low prices.  The Christian Diehl Brewery, for instance, entered the business in 1922, producing Jerzee brand evaporated milk as a response to the <a href="/Volstead_Act" title="Volstead Act">Volstead Act</a>.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.bgsu.edu/colleges/library/cac/ms/page46166.html" rel="nofollow">Diehl records at Bowling Green State University</a> &#60;/ref&#62;  Several clinical studies from that time period suggested that babies fed evaporated milk formula thrive as well as breastfed babies.&#60;ref name=&#34;Marriott&#34;&#62;{{cite journal</p>

Evaporated milk is fresh, <a href="/Homogenization_(chemistry)" title="Homogenization (chemistry)">homogenized</a> milk from which 60 percent of the water has been removed. After the water has been removed, the product is chilled, stabilized, packaged and sterilized.

<p>According to the United States Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Chapter 1, Part 131, Sub part B, Section 130  &#34;Evaporated milk&#34;, (April 2006) 
&#60;blockquote&#62;</p>
<pre>   (a) Description. Evaporated milk is the liquid food obtained by 
</pre>
<p>partial removal of water only from milk. It contains not less than 6.5 
percent by weight of milk fat, not less than 16.5 percent by weight of 
milk solids not fat, and not less than 23 percent by weight of total 
milk solids. Evaporated milk contains added vitamin D as prescribed by 
paragraph (b) of this section. It is homogenized. It is sealed in a 
container and so processed by heat, either before or after sealing, as 
to prevent spoilage.

Sections (b) - (f) of the above code regulate vitamin addition, optional ingredients, methods of analysis, nomenclature, and label declaration.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2006/aprqtr/21cfr131.130.htm" rel="nofollow">(21CFR131.130)</a>:&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
