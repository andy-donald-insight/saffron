<p>After the fruits are picked and washed, the juice is extracted by one of two automated methods. In the first method, two metal cups with sharp metal tubes on the bottom cup come together, removing the <a href="/Peel_(fruit)" title="Peel (fruit)">peel</a> and forcing the flesh of the fruit through the metal tube. The juice of the fruit then escapes through small holes in the tube. The peels can then be used further, and are washed to remove <a href="/Oils" title="Oils">oils</a>, which are reclaimed later for usage. The second method requires the fruits to be cut in half before being subjected to <a href="/Reamers" title="Reamers">reamers</a>, which extract the juice.&#60;ref name=&#34;madehow.com&#34;&#62;{{cite web|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.madehow.com/Volume-4/Orange-Juice.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.madehow.com/Volume-4/Orange-Juice.html</a>|title=How orange juice is made - production process, making, used, processing, product, industry, Raw Materials, The Manufacturing Process of orange juice, Byproducts/Waste, Quality Control|work=madehow.com|accessdate=7 May 2015}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>After the juice is filtered, it may be concentrated, which reduces the size of juice by a factor of 5, making it easier to transport and increasing its <a href="/Shelf_life" title="Shelf life">expiration date</a>. Juices are concentrated by heating under a <a href="/Vacuum" title="Vacuum">vacuum</a> to remove water, and then cooling to around 13 degrees Celsius. About two thirds of the water in a juice is removed.&#60;ref name=&#34;sspindia.com&#34;/&#62; The juice is then later reconstituted, in which the concentrate is mixed with water and other factors to return any lost flavor from the concentrating process. Juices can also be sold in a concentrated state, in which the consumer adds water to the concentrated juice as preparation.&#60;ref name=&#34;madehow.com&#34;/&#62;</p>
<p>Juices are then pasteurized and filled into containers, often while still hot. If the juice is poured into a container while hot, it is cooled as quickly as possible. Packages that cannot stand heat require sterile conditions for filling. Chemicals such as <a href="/Hydrogen_peroxide" title="Hydrogen peroxide">hydrogen peroxide</a> can be used to sterilize containers.&#60;ref name=&#34;madehow.com&#34;/&#62; Plants can make anywhere from 1 to 20 tonnes a day.&#60;ref name=&#34;sspindia.com&#34;/&#62;</p>

<p>The <a href="/American_Academy_of_Pediatrics" title="American Academy of Pediatrics">American Academy of Pediatrics</a> says that fruit juice should not be given to infants before 6 months of age. For children ages 1 to 6, intake of fruit juice should be limited to 4 to 6 ounces per day (about a half to three-quarters of a cup). Giving children excessive juice can lead to poor nutrition, diarrhea, gas, abdominal pain, bloating, and tooth decay.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.med.umich.edu/yourchild/topics/feedbaby.htm#milk" rel="nofollow">http://www.med.umich.edu/yourchild/topics/feedbaby.htm#milk</a> |title=Feeding Your Baby and Toddler (Birth to Age Two): Your Child: University of Michigan Health System |publisher=Med.umich.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-08-25}}&#60;/ref&#62;&#60;ref&#62;{{cite journal | date = May 2001 | title = The use and misuse of fruit juice in pediatrics | author = American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Nutrition | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 107 | issue = 5| pages = 1210–3 | doi=10.1542/peds.107.5.1210}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>Juice cleanses have become a popular diet. The key concept of juice cleanses, detoxification, bases on the assertion that by consuming only nutrient rich substances (juice) and eliminating <a href="/Dairy" title="Dairy">dairy</a>, <a href="/Wheat" title="Wheat">wheat</a>, <a href="/Gluten" title="Gluten">gluten</a>, and <a href="/Fermented" title="Fermented">fermented</a> foods, the body can better heal physical problems. A juice cleanse requires the consumption of nothing except for juice for multiple days, with proposed health benefits including: reduction in appetite, rest for the stomach and <a href="/Liver" title="Liver">liver</a>, elimination of harmful foods, flooding the body with super nutrition, weight loss, energy improvement, re-hydration, detoxification, and cell healing. Unlike most diets, juice cleanses do not last for extended periods, usually ending in less than a week.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.awaken.com/2014/01/the-real-reasons-juice-cleanses-can-get-your-health-back-on-track/" rel="nofollow">http://www.awaken.com/2014/01/the-real-reasons-juice-cleanses-can-get-your-health-back-on-track/</a>|title=The Real Reasons Juice Cleanses Can Get Your Health Back on Track|work=awaken.com|accessdate=7 May 2015}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>

<p>One of the first regularly produced juices was <a href="/Lemonade" title="Lemonade">lemonade</a>, appearing in 16th century Italy, as an import, after its conception in the Middle East. Orange juice originated in the 17th century. In the 18th Century, James Lind linked citrus fruits to the prevention of <a href="/Scurvy" title="Scurvy">scurvy</a>, which, a century later, lead to the implementation of the Merchant Shipping Act of 1867, requiring all Ocean-bound British ships to carry citrus-based juice on board.&#60;ref name=&#34;ebscohost.com&#34;/&#62;</p>
<p>A dentist, by the name Thomas B. Welch, developed a pasteurization method that allowed for the storage of juice, without the juice fermenting into <a href="/Alcohol" title="Alcohol">alcohol</a> in 1869. His method involved filtering squeezed grape juice into bottles, sealing them with <a href="/Cork_(material)" title="Cork (material)">cork</a> and <a href="/Wax" title="Wax">wax</a>, and then placing them in boiling water. This method kills the <a href="/Yeast" title="Yeast">yeast</a> responsible for fermentation. He then sold his new product as “Dr Welch&#39;s Unfermented Wine”.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external free" href="http://horttech.ashspublications.org/content/8/4/471.full.pdf&#60;/ref&#38;gt" rel="nofollow">http://horttech.ashspublications.org/content/8/4/471.full.pdf&#60;/ref&#38;gt</a>;</p>

The <a href="/McKinley_Tariff" title="McKinley Tariff">McKinley Tariff</a> Act of 1890 increased import takes from 38 to 49.5 percent, and set taxes on fruit juices based on the alcohol content of the drink.
