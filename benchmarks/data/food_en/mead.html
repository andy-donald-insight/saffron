<p>By measuring the specific gravity of the must once before fermentation and throughout the fermentation process by means of a <a href="/Hydrometer" title="Hydrometer">hydrometer</a> or <a href="/Refractometer" title="Refractometer">refractometer</a>, mead makers can determine the proportion of alcohol by volume that will appear in the final product. This also serves another purpose. By measuring specific gravity throughout fermentation, a mead maker can quickly troubleshoot a &#34;stuck&#34; batch, the word &#34;stuck&#34; being used to describe a fermentation process that has halted prematurely.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite book | title=The Compleat Meadmaker | publisher=Brewers Publications | author=Schramm, Ken | year=2003 | pages=31, 37 | isbn=978-0-937381-80-9}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>Meads will often ferment well at the same temperatures in which wine is fermented.</p>
<p>After primary fermentation slows down significantly — usually when specific gravity reaches 1.010 — the must is then racked into a second container. This is known as secondary fermentation. Some larger commercial fermenters are designed to allow both primary and secondary fermentation to happen inside of the same vessel. Racking is done for two reasons: it lets the mead sit away from the remains of the yeast cells (<a href="/Lees_(fermentation)" title="Lees (fermentation)">lees</a>) that have died during the fermentation process. Second, this lets the mead have time to clear. If the mead maker wishes to backsweeten the product or prevent it from oxidizing, <a href="/Potassium_metabisulfite" title="Potassium metabisulfite">potassium metabisulfite</a> and <a href="/Potassium_sorbate" title="Potassium sorbate">potassium sorbate</a> are added. After the mead clears, it is bottled and distributed.</p>

<p><a href="/Mulled_wine" title="Mulled wine">Mulled</a> mead is a popular drink at Christmas time, where mead is flavored with spices (and sometimes various fruits) and warmed, traditionally by having a hot poker plunged into it.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}</p>
<p>Some meads retain some measure of the sweetness of the original honey, and some may even be considered as dessert wines.  Drier meads are also available, and some producers offer sparkling meads.</p>
<p>There are faux-meads, which are actually wines with honey added after fermentation as a sweetener and flavoring.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external free" href="http://www.gotmead.com/index2.php?option=com_content&#38;do_pdf=1&#38;id=1094&#60;/ref&#38;gt" rel="nofollow">http://www.gotmead.com/index2.php?option=com_content&#38;do_pdf=1&#38;id=1094&#60;/ref&#38;gt</a>;</p>
<p>Historically, meads were fermented with wild <a href="/Yeast" title="Yeast">yeasts</a> and <a href="/Bacteria" title="Bacteria">bacteria</a> (as noted in the recipe quoted above) residing on the skins of the fruit or within the honey itself. Wild yeasts can produce inconsistent results. Yeast companies have isolated strains of yeast which produce consistently appealing products. Brewers, winemakers and mead makers commonly use them for fermentation, including yeast strains identified specifically for mead fermentation. These are strains that have been selected because of their characteristic of preserving delicate honey flavors and aromas.</p>
<p>Mead can also be distilled to a brandy or liqueur strength. A version called &#34;honey jack&#34; can be made by partly freezing a quantity of mead and straining the ice out of the liquid (a process known as <a href="/Fractional_freezing#Freeze_distillation" title="Fractional freezing">freeze distillation</a>), in the same way that <a href="/Applejack_(beverage)" title="Applejack (beverage)">applejack</a> is made from <a href="/Cider" title="Cider">cider</a>.</p>
