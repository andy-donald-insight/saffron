<p>The <a href="/Eastern_Orthodox_Church" title="Eastern Orthodox Church">Eastern Orthodox</a> and <a href="/Eastern_Catholic_Churches" title="Eastern Catholic Churches">Eastern Catholic</a> churches use <a href="/Leaven" title="Leaven">leavened</a> bread for the Eucharist. Thus, the sacramental bread symbolizes the <a href="/Resurrection_of_Jesus" title="Resurrection of Jesus">Resurrected Christ</a>.  The <i>hostia</i> or sacramental bread, known as <i><a href="/Prosphora" title="Prosphora">prosphorá</a></i> or a πρόσφορον (<i>prósphoron</i>, &#34;offering&#34;) may be made out of only four ingredients: fine (white) <a href="/Wheat_flour" title="Wheat flour">wheat flour</a>, pure water, yeast, and salt.</p>
<p>Sometimes <a href="/Holy_water" title="Holy water">holy water</a> will be either sprinkled into the dough or on the kneading trough at the beginning of the process.</p>
<p>The baking may only be performed by a believing Orthodox Christian in good standing—having preferably been recently to <a href="/Confession_(religion)" title="Confession (religion)">Confession</a>, and is accompanied by prayer and fasting. Before baking, each loaf is formed by placing two disks of dough, one on top of the other, and stamping it with a special liturgical seal. The prosphora should be fresh and not stale or moldy when presented at the <a href="/Altar" title="Altar">altar</a> for use in the <a href="/Divine_Liturgy" title="Divine Liturgy">Divine Liturgy</a>. Often several prosphora will be baked and offered by the faithful, and the priest chooses the best one for the <a href="/Lamb_(liturgy)" title="Lamb (liturgy)">Lamb</a> (Host) that will be <a href="/Consecrated" title="Consecrated">consecrated</a>.  The remaining loaves are blessed and offered back to the congregation after the end of the <a href="/Divine_Liturgy" title="Divine Liturgy">Divine Liturgy</a> (Eucharist); this bread is called the <i><a href="/Antidoron" title="Antidoron">antidoron</a></i> (<a href="/Greek_language" title="Greek language">Greek</a>: αντίδωρον, <i>antídōron</i>), i.e. a &#34;gift returned&#34;, or &#34;in place of the gifts&#34;.</p>

<p>The word &#34;host&#34; is derived from the <a href="/Latin" title="Latin">Latin</a> <i><a href="/Glossary_of_ancient_Roman_religion#hostia" title="Glossary of ancient Roman religion">hostia</a></i>, which means &#34;<a href="/Sacrifice" title="Sacrifice">sacrificial victim</a>&#34;.  The term can be used to describe the bread both before and after <a href="/Consecration" title="Consecration">consecration</a>, though it is more correct to use it after consecration—&#34;altar bread&#34; being preferred before consecration. Western theology teaches that at the <a href="/Words_of_Institution" title="Words of Institution">Words of Institution</a> the bread is changed or altered (known as either <a href="/Transubstantiation" title="Transubstantiation">transubstantiation</a> or <a href="/Transignification" title="Transignification">transignification</a> according to tradition or denomination) into the <a href="/Body_of_Christ" title="Body of Christ">Body of Christ</a>, while Eastern theology sees the <a href="/Epiclesis" title="Epiclesis">epiclesis</a> as no less necessary.</p>
<p>Hosts are often made by <a href="/Nun" title="Nun">nuns</a> as a means of supporting their religious communities.  In New Zealand, however, the St Vincent de Paul Society hires individuals with intellectual disabilities to bake, cut out and sort the bread thereby offering paid employment to those who wouldn&#39;t have that option otherwise.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external free" href="http://vinnies-wellington.org.nz/altar-breads/&#60;/ref&#38;gt" rel="nofollow">http://vinnies-wellington.org.nz/altar-breads/&#60;/ref&#38;gt</a>; In the <a href="/Latin_Rite" title="Latin Rite">Latin Rite</a>, <a href="/Unleavened_bread" title="Unleavened bread">unleavened bread</a> is used as in the Jewish <a href="/Passover" title="Passover">Passover</a> or Feast of Unleavened Bread.

The <a href="/Armenian_Catholic_Church" title="Armenian Catholic Church">Armenian Catholic Church</a> (like the <a href="/Armenian_Apostolic_Church" title="Armenian Apostolic Church">Armenian Apostolic Church</a>), the <a href="/Syro-Malabar_Church" title="Syro-Malabar Church">Syro-Malabar Church</a> and the <a href="/Maronite_Church" title="Maronite Church">Maronite Church</a> have adopted the use of unleavened bread (see <a href="/Liturgical_Latinisation" title="Liturgical Latinisation">Liturgical Latinisation</a>). Some traditions proscribe the use of spiced, flavored or sweetened hosts, while others allow it.{{citation needed|date=June 2008}} However, both Eastern and Western traditions insist that the bread must be made from wheat. The <a href="/Canon_law_(Catholic_Church)" title="Canon law (Catholic Church)">Code of Canon Law</a>, <a class="external text" href="http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P3A.HTM" rel="nofollow">Canon 924</a> requires that the hosts be made from wheat flour only and recently made so that there is no danger of spoiling.</p>
<p>The <a href="/General_Instruction_of_the_Roman_Missal" title="General Instruction of the Roman Missal">General Instruction of the Roman Missal</a> §321 recommends that &#34;the eucharistic bread ... be made in such a way that the priest at Mass with a congregation is able in practice to break it into parts for distribution to at least some of the faithful. ... The action of the <a href="/Fraction_(religion)" title="Fraction (religion)">fraction</a> or breaking of bread, which gave its name to the <a href="/Eucharist" title="Eucharist">Eucharist</a> in apostolic times, will bring out more clearly the force and importance of the sign of unity of all in the one bread, and of the sign of charity by the fact that the one bread is distributed among the brothers and sisters&#34;.</p>
<p>In 1995 <a href="/Joseph_Cardinal_Ratzinger" title="Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger">Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger</a>, then Prefect of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments, wrote a letter to the Episcopal Conferences in which he expanded the Code of Canon Law, stating that low-<a href="/Gluten" title="Gluten">gluten</a> bread would be considered “valid matter” for hosts as long as no additional substances “alter[ed] the nature of the substance of the bread.”&#60;ref name=&#34;thinkprogress.org&#34;&#62;{{cite web|url=<a class="external free" href="http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/12/29/3607228/low-gluten-communion-wafers/" rel="nofollow">http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/12/29/3607228/low-gluten-communion-wafers/</a>|title=Low-Gluten Diet Alternatives Have Reached A New Frontier: The Catholic Church|publisher=}}&#60;/ref&#62; Since the 2000s, hosts with gluten content that falls below the threshold of what would be considered detrimental to people with <a href="/Coeliac_disease" title="Coeliac disease">coeliac disease</a> have been manufactured in the United States, especially in parts of Missouri and New York.&#60;ref name=&#34;thinkprogress.org&#34;/&#62;</p>
