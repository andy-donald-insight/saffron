<p>Though the origins of bagels are somewhat obscure, it is known that they were widely consumed in East European Jewish communities from the 17th century.

<p>The basic roll-with-a-hole design is hundreds of years old and has other practical advantages besides providing for a more even cooking and baking of the dough: the hole could be used to thread string or dowels through groups of bagels, allowing for easier handling and transportation and more appealing seller displays.&#60;ref&#62;Nathan, Joan (2008) <a class="external text" href="http://www.slate.com/articles/life/food/2008/11/a_short_history_of_the_bagel.html" rel="nofollow">A Short History of the Bagel: From ancient Egypt to Lender&#39;s</a> <i><a href="/Slate_(magazine)" title="Slate (magazine)">Slate</a></i>, posted Nov. 12, 2008&#60;/ref&#62;&#60;ref&#62;Columbia University NYC24 New Media Workshop website <a class="external text" href="http://www.nyc24.org/2002/issue01/story02/page03.asp" rel="nofollow">History of the Bagel: The Hole Story</a>, retrieved February 24, 2009.&#60;/ref&#62;</p>

At its most basic, traditional bagel dough contains wheat flour (without <a href="/Cereal_germ" title="Cereal germ">germ</a> or <a href="/Bran" title="Bran">bran</a>), salt, water, and <a href="/Leavening_agent" title="Leavening agent">yeast leavening</a>. <a href="/Bread_flour#Types_of_Flour" title="Bread flour">Bread flour</a> or other high <a href="/Gluten" title="Gluten">gluten</a> flours are preferred to create the firm and dense but spongy bagel shape and chewy texture.&#60;ref name=&#34;Britannica&#34; /&#62; Most bagel recipes call for the addition of a sweetener to the dough, often <a href="/Barley_malt" title="Barley malt">barley malt</a> (syrup or crystals), honey, <a href="/High_fructose_corn_syrup" title="High fructose corn syrup">high fructose corn syrup</a>, <a href="/Sugar" title="Sugar">sugar</a>, with or without eggs, milk or butter.&#60;ref name=&#34;Britannica&#34; /&#62; Leavening can be accomplished using either a <a href="/Sourdough" title="Sourdough">sourdough</a> technique or using commercially produced yeast.</p>
<p>Bagels are traditionally made by:
</p>
<ul>
<li>mixing and kneading the ingredients to form the dough</li>
<li>shaping the dough into the traditional bagel shape, round with a hole in the middle, from a long thin piece of dough</li>
<li><a href="/Proofing_(baking_technique)" title="Proofing (baking technique)">proofing</a> the bagels for at least 12 hours at low temperature (40–50&#38;nbsp;°F = 4.5–10&#38;nbsp;°C)</li>

<li>baking at between 175&#38;nbsp;°C and 315&#38;nbsp;°C (about 350–600&#38;nbsp;°F)</li>
</ul>

<p>It is this unusual production method which is said to give bagels their distinctive taste, chewy texture, and shiny appearance. In recent years, a variant of this process has emerged, producing what is sometimes called the steam bagel. To make a steam bagel, the process of boiling is skipped, and the bagels are instead baked in an oven equipped with a steam injection system.&#60;ref&#62;Reinhart, P., <i>The Bread Baker&#39;s Apprentice</i>. Ten Speed Press, 2001, p. 115.&#60;/ref&#62; In commercial bagel production, the steam bagel process requires less labor, since bagels need only be directly handled once, at the shaping stage. Thereafter, the bagels need never be removed from their pans as they are refrigerated and then steam-baked. The steam-bagel is not considered to be a genuine bagel by purists, as it results in a fluffier, softer, less chewy product more akin to a <a href="/Bread_roll" title="Bread roll">finger roll</a> that happens to be shaped like a bagel. Steam bagels are also considered lower quality by purists as the dough used is intentionally more <a href="/Base_(chemistry)" title="Base (chemistry)">basic</a>. The increase in <a href="/PH" title="PH">pH</a> is to aid browning, since the steam injection process uses neutral water steam instead of a basic solution bath.</p>
<p>If not consumed immediately, there are certain storing techniques that can help to keep the bagel moist and fresh. First, cool bagels in a paper bag, then wrap the paper bag in a plastic bag (attempting to rid the bags of as much air as possible without squishing the bagels), then freeze for up to six months.&#60;ref&#62;Jonathan, Croswell. <a class="external text" href="http://www.livestrong.com/article/510977-how-to-keep-a-bagel-moist/" rel="nofollow">How to Keep a Bagel Moist</a>,

<p>As suggested above, other bagel styles can be found in other places, akin to the way in which families within a given culture employ a variety of methods when cooking a specific indigenous dish. Thus, Chicago-style bagels are baked or baked with steam.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|url=<a class="external free" href="http://hometownbagel.com/" rel="nofollow">http://hometownbagel.com/</a>|title=Hometown Bagel, Inc.|accessdate=2012-04-20}}&#60;/ref&#62; The traditional London bagel (or beigel as it is spelled) is harder and has a coarser texture with air bubbles.

<p>Poppy seeds are sometimes referred to by their Yiddish name, spelled either <i>mun</i> or <i>mon</i> (written מאָן), which is very similar to the German word for poppy, <i>Mohn</i>, as used in <i>Mohnbrötchen</i>.
