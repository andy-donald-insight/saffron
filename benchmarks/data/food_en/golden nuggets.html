<p>Golden Nuggets were introduced in the 1970s in the UK and the United States, manufactured by <a href="/Nabisco" title="Nabisco">Nabisco</a>. They were then withdrawn from the UK market in the late 1970s.</p>
<p>However, they were brought back to the UK in 1999 with a £1 million advertising campaign, perhaps in response to demand from people who had enjoyed them in the 1970s and now had their own children.</p>

<p>The packaging features various cartoon characters (drawn by Gary Dunn): Klondike Pete (a gold prospector who mines Golden Nuggets), his mule Pardner, his enemies; two claim-jumpers named Plum Loco Louie and Boot Hill Bob (jointly &#34;The Breakfast Bandits&#34;), and a Golden Nuggets Bee.<a class="external autonumber" href="http://www.lavasurfer.com/cereal-nestle-nabisco.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. The box also sometimes features puzzles suited to the 7–12-year-old range.</p>
<p>The cereal is marketed with the slogan &#34;They Taste Yeee Haaa!!&#34;&#60;ref name=&#34;nuggets&#34;&#62;{{cite web</p>

<p>In 2002, as part of Nestlé&#39;s <a href="/Lilo_%26_Stitch" title="Lilo &amp; Stitch">Lilo &#38; Stitch</a> promotion, chocolate-flavoured nuggets were mixed in with the Golden Nuggets (according to Klondike Pete in the ads during this time, this was Stitch&#39;s work, saying that &#34;That rascal Stitch has gotten some of these Golden Nuggets chocolatey!&#34;)</p>
