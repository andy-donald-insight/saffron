A <a href="/Fermentation_in_food_processing" title="Fermentation in food processing">fermented</a> fish sauce called <i><a href="/Garum" title="Garum">garum</a></i> was a staple of <a href="/Greco-Roman" title="Greco-Roman">Greco-Roman</a> cuisine and of the Mediterranean economy of the <a href="/Roman_Empire" title="Roman Empire">Roman Empire</a>, as the first-century encyclopaedist <a href="/Pliny_the_Elder" title="Pliny the Elder">Pliny the Elder</a> writes in <i>Historia Naturalis</i> and the fourth/fifth-century <a href="/Ancient_Rome" title="Ancient Rome">Roman</a> culinary text <a href="/Apicius" title="Apicius">Apicius</a> includes garum in its recipes.  The use of similar fermented anchovy sauces in Europe can be traced back to the 17th century. The <a href="/Lea_%26_Perrins" title="Lea &amp; Perrins">Lea &#38; Perrins</a> brand was commercialised in 1837 and has continued to be the leading global brand of Worcestershire sauce.</p>
<p>The origin of the Lea &#38; Perrins recipe is unclear. The packaging originally stated that the sauce came &#34;from the recipe of a nobleman in the county&#34;. The company has also claimed that &#34;Lord Marcus Sandys, ex-Governor of <a href="/Bengal" title="Bengal">Bengal</a>&#34;  encountered it while in India with the <a href="/East_India_Company" title="East India Company">East India Company</a> in the 1830s, and commissioned the local <a href="/Apothecary" title="Apothecary">apothecaries</a> to recreate it.  However, author Brian Keogh concluded in his privately published history of the Lea &#38; Perrins firm on the 100th anniversary of the Midland Road plant, that &#34;No Lord Sandys was ever  a governor of Bengal, or as far as any records show, ever in India.&#34;&#60;ref name=&#34;brian&#34; /&#62;</p>
<p>&#34;Lord Marcus Sandys&#34; may refer to <a href="/Baron_Sandys" title="Baron Sandys">Arthur Moyses William Sandys, 2nd Baron Sandys</a> (1792–1860) of <a href="/Ombersley" title="Ombersley">Ombersley</a> Court, Worcestershire, who was a Lieutenant-General and a member of the <a href="/British_House_of_Commons" title="British House of Commons">House of Commons</a> at the time of the legend. The first name may be a confusion of his brother and heir, Arthur <i>Marcus</i> Cecil Sandys, 3rd Baron Sandys (1798–1863), although he did not succeed to the title until 1860, when the sauce was already established on the British market. The barony in the Sandys family {{IPAc-en |ˈ|s|æ|n|d|z}} (&#34;sands&#34;) had been revived in 1802 for the second baron&#39;s mother, Mary Sandys Hill, so at the date of the legend, in the 1830s, &#34;Lord&#34; Sandys was actually a Lady. No identifiable reference to her could possibly appear on a commercially bottled sauce without a serious breach of decorum.  A version of the story was published by Thomas Smith in 1885:&#60;ref&#62;Smith, Thomas <i>Successful Advertising</i> (1885 7th ed.)&#60;/ref&#62; 
{{Quote | We quote the following history of the well-known Worcester sauce, as given in the <i>World</i>. The label shows it is prepared &#34;from the recipe of a nobleman in the county.&#34; The nobleman may be Lord Sandys. Many years ago, Mrs. Grey, author of <i>The Gambler&#39;s Wife</i> and other novels, was on a visit at Ombersley Court, when Lady Sandys chanced to remark that she wished she could get some very good <a href="/Curry_powder" title="Curry powder">curry powder</a>, which elicited from Mrs. Grey that she had in her desk an excellent recipe, which her uncle, Sir Charles, Chief Justice of India, had brought thence, and given her. Lady Sandys said that there were some clever chemists in Worcester, who perhaps might be able to make up the powder. Messrs. Lea and Perrins looked at the recipe, doubted if they could procure all the ingredients, but said they would do their best, and in due time forwarded a packet of the powder. Subsequently the happy thought struck someone in the business that the powder might, in solution, make a good sauce. The profits now amount to thousands of pounds a year.}}</p>
<p>According to historian and <a href="/Herald_for_Wales" title="Herald for Wales">Herald for Wales</a>, Major Francis Jones, the introduction of the recipe can be attributed to Captain Henry Lewis Edwardes (1788–1866).&#60;ref&#62;{{cite book |last= Jones | first = Francis |year=1987 |title= Historic Carmarthenshire Homes and their Families | publisher =Brawdy Books | location = Pembrokeshire |<a class="external text" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/">isbn </a>= 978-0-90697-2-021}}&#60;/ref&#62;  Edwardes, originally of <a href="/Rhyd-y-gors" title="Rhyd-y-gors">Rhyd-y-gors</a>, <a href="/Carmarthenshire" title="Carmarthenshire">Carmarthenshire</a>, was a veteran of the Napoleonic wars and held the position of Deputy-Lieutenant of Carmarthenshire.  He is believed to have brought the recipe home after travels in India.  The article does not say how the recipe found its way to Messrs Lea and Perrins.</p>
<p>When the recipe was first mixed at the pharmacy of <a href="/John_Wheeley_Lea" title="John Wheeley Lea">John Wheeley Lea</a> and <a href="/William_Henry_Perrins" title="William Henry Perrins">William Henry Perrins</a>, the resulting product was so strong that it was considered inedible and the barrel was abandoned in the basement. Looking to make space in the storage area a few years later, the chemists decided to try it again, and discovered that the sauce had fermented and mellowed and was now palatable. In 1838 the first bottles of &#34;Lea &#38; Perrins Worcestershire sauce&#34; were released to the general public.&#60;ref name=&#34;brian&#34;&#62;Keogh, Brian (1997) <i>The Secret Sauce: a History of Lea &#38; Perrins</i> <a class="external text" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/9780953216918" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/9780953216918">ISBN 978-0-9532169-1-8</a>&#60;/ref&#62;&#60;ref&#62;Shurtleff, W.; Aoyagi, A. 2012. &#34;History of Worcestershire Sauce (1837–2012).&#34; Lafayette, <a href="/California" title="California">CA</a>: Soyinfo Center. 213 pp. (533 references. 42 photos and illustrations.

It is used for Chinese foods such as the <i><a href="/Shengjian_mantou" title="Shengjian mantou">shengjian mantou</a></i>, which are small, pan-fried pork buns.

It commonly accompanies western-influenced <i><a href="/Y%C5%8Dshoku" title="Yōshoku">yōshoku</a></i> dishes such as the aforementioned tonkatsu and <a href="/Korokke" title="Korokke">korokke</a>. <a href="/Yakisoba" title="Yakisoba">Yakisoba</a> sauce, and <a href="/Okonomiyaki" title="Okonomiyaki">okonomiyaki</a> sauce are also variants of Worcestershire sauce, often thicker and sweeter than the original.</p>

In the United States, Lea &#38; Perrins Worcestershire sauce differs from the British recipe. Its ingredients are listed as: vinegar, molasses, sugar, anchovies, water, onions, salt, garlic, tamarind concentrate, cloves, natural flavourings and <a href="/Chili_pepper" title="Chili pepper">chili pepper</a> extract. The main difference is the use of <a href="/White_vinegar" title="White vinegar">distilled white vinegar</a> in place of <a href="/Malt_vinegar" title="Malt vinegar">malt vinegar</a>, as well as three times as much sugar (measured in carbohydrates) and slightly more than three times as much sodium per gram. (The US nutrition label cites a teaspoon as one serving in contrast to the British/Canadian &#34;one tablespoon.&#34;  Nutrients cited are normalized.)  A thicker variety is also sold for the US market. The US version is packaged differently from the British version, coming in a dark bottle with a beige label and wrapped in paper. Lea &#38; Perrins USA claims this practice is a vestige of shipping practices from the 19th century, when the product was imported from England, as a measure of protection for the bottles.&#60;ref&#62;{{Citation | url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.leaperrins.com/about-lea-perrins.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.leaperrins.com/about-lea-perrins.aspx</a> | title = About | publisher = Lea &#38; Perrins}}.&#60;/ref&#62; The producer also claims that its Worcestershire sauce is the oldest commercially bottled condiment in the US.&#60;ref&#62;{{Citation | title = History | url = <a class="external free" href="http://www.leaperrins.com/history.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.leaperrins.com/history.aspx</a> | publisher = Lea &#38; Perrins}}.&#60;/ref&#62;  For years, the US version contained <a href="/High_fructose_corn_syrup" title="High fructose corn syrup">high fructose corn syrup</a>, but sugar was used to replace this ingredient in early 2011.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite news | last =McLaughlin |first=Katy |title=Sweet Revenge, Chefs Pour on the Sugar | url = <a class="external free" href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304760604576427693903949786.html#articleTabs%3Darticle" rel="nofollow">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304760604576427693903949786.html#articleTabs%3Darticle</a> |accessdate=7 July 2011 |newspaper = <a href="/The_Wall_Street_Journal" title="The Wall Street Journal">The Wall Street Journal</a> | date =6 July 2011}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
