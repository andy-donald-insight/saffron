<p><b>Mi san dao</b> (蜜三刀; literally &#34;three cuts of honey&#34;) is a fried cake glazed in <a href="/Maltose" title="Maltose">malt sugar</a> and is a traditional dish of <a href="/Beijing_cuisine" title="Beijing cuisine">Beijing cuisine</a>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Preparation">Preparation</span></h2>
<p>The basic ingredients to this dish are <a href="/Flour" title="Flour">flour</a>, <a href="/Baking_soda" title="Baking soda">baking soda</a>, and <a href="/Vegetable_oil" title="Vegetable oil">vegetable oil</a>. About 25% of the flour would be mixed with water, baking soda, and <a href="/Maltose" title="Maltose">malt sugar</a> for fermentation, and this is the outside skin. The remaining flour would be mixed evenly with water and this is the inner part. Both types of dough would be compressed into rectangular shapes and stacked. The sandwiched dough would then be compressed thinner and cut into long strips, and then folded and cut three times into 4 equal parts. The resulting dough pieces would then be fried in vegetable oil. Once the fried dough pieces are taken out, they are dipped in malt sugar and then served.</p>
