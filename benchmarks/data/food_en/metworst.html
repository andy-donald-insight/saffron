<p><b>Metworst</b> ({{IPA-nl|ˈmɛtʋɔrst|-|Nl-metworst.ogg}}) or <b>droge worst</b> ({{IPA-nl|ˈdroːɣə ʋɔrst}}; dry sausage) is a type of traditional <a href="/Dutch_cuisine" title="Dutch cuisine">Dutch</a> <a href="/Sausage" title="Sausage">sausage</a>. The sausages have a very strong flavour and are made from raw minced pork which is then <a href="/Drying_(food)" title="Drying (food)">air dried</a>.</p>
<p><i>Droge worst</i> simply means <i>dry sausage</i>, referring to drying process and texture of the product. The name <i>metworst</i> (Met from the Low German word mett, meaning minced pork without bacon) is similar to the German <i><a href="/Mettwurst" title="Mettwurst">Mettwurst</a></i>, though only in name; as the taste and preparation of both sausage types is very different. </p>
<p><i>Metworst</i> is traditionally found throughout the <a href="/Netherlands" title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a> and <a href="/Flanders" title="Flanders">Flanders</a>. Most of the production is the northern provinces of the Netherlands, <a href="/Groningen_(province)" title="Groningen (province)">Groningen</a>, <a href="/Friesland" title="Friesland">Friesland</a> and <a href="/Drenthe" title="Drenthe">Drenthe</a>, where wind conditions there are most suitable for quickly drying the sausages in open air.</p>
<p><a href="/Finland" title="Finland">Finnish</a> <i>meetvursti</i> resembles the Dutch metworst or <a href="/Salami" title="Salami">salami</a>: it is dry, hard, strong-flavored, dense, made from horse meat and eaten as a cold cut on bread.</p>
<p>Originally <i>metworst</i>, thanks to its preservability, served as an emergency meat supply to poor farmers in times of need or lack of fresh meat. As meat production gradually rose, the sausage began to be used as lunch for <a href="/Laborer" title="Laborer">field laborers</a>. </p>
<p>The sausage is the direct ancestor of the better known <a href="/South_African" title="South African">South African</a> <i><a href="/Dro%C3%AB_wors" title="Droë wors">droë wors</a></i> which is near identical in its way of production; though the meat used is beef and mutton rather than pork.</p>
