<p>At the 1904 World Fair, the <a href="/Quaker_Oats_Company" title="Quaker Oats Company">Quaker Oats Company</a> made a <a href="/Candy-coated" title="Candy-coated">candy-coated</a> puffed cereal, a wheat-based product similar to <a href="/Cracker_Jack" title="Cracker Jack">Cracker Jack&#39;s</a> candy-coated <a href="/Popcorn" title="Popcorn">popcorn</a>. The product concept was re-introduced unsuccessfully in 1939 by another business as <i>Ranger Joe</i>, the first pre-sweetened, candy-coated breakfast cereal. Post Foods introduced their own version in 1948.
The Post version was originally called <b>Happy Jax</b>, and was renamed to <b>Sugar Crisp</b> the next year.&#60;ref name=&#34;:1&#34; /&#62; The name was later changed to <b>Super Sugar Crisp</b>, and in 1985, it was changed again to <b>Super Golden Crisp</b>.&#60;ref name=&#34;cite3&#34; /&#62;  Finally, it was changed to <b>Golden Crisp</b> (during a time when many cereals dropped the word &#34;Sugar&#34; from their titles) in the American market. </p>
<p>In the early 1970s, there was a short-lived variation on the original Sugar Crisp, called <b>Super Orange Crisp</b>, which had orange-flavored O&#39;s in it.&#60;ref name=&#34;test&#34;&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://i106.photobucket.com/albums/m276/justking81/Articles/dae61736.jpg" rel="nofollow">Super Orange Crisp</a>, short-lived spin-off cereal.&#60;/ref&#62; </p>
<p>The product is still sold as Sugar Crisp in <a href="/Canada" title="Canada">Canada</a>. In Canada, the box still displays the Sugar Bear mascot and the phrase &#34;Can&#39;t get enough of that Sugar Crisp.&#34;</p>

<p>Advertisements in the 1950s positioned this <a href="/Sugar_cereal" title="Sugar cereal">sugar cereal</a> as being appropriate to eat for breakfast, as a snack, or as <a href="/Candy" title="Candy">candy</a>, similar to candy-coated popcorn products like <a href="/Cracker_Jack" title="Cracker Jack">Cracker Jack</a>.&#60;ref name=&#34;:1&#34;&#62;{{Cite book|title = Candy: A Century of Panic and Pleasure|url = <a class="external free" href="https://books.google.com/books?id=g_5DAwAAQBAJ&#38;pg=PA287" rel="nofollow">https://books.google.com/books?id=g_5DAwAAQBAJ&#38;pg=PA287</a>|publisher = Macmillan|date = 2013-10-15|<a class="external text" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/">isbn </a>= 9780865477568|language = en|first = Samira|last = Kawash|pages = 287–289 and color plate #15}}&#60;/ref&#62;  Early advertisements featured three animated <a href="/Cartoon" title="Cartoon">cartoon</a> bears named Candy, Handy, and Dandy as the <a href="/Mascots" title="Mascots">mascots</a>. The early slogan said, &#34;As a cereal it&#39;s dandy—for snacks it&#39;s so handy—or eat it like candy!&#34;&#60;ref name=&#34;:1&#34; /&#62;</p>
<p>Later television advertisements feature one mascot, an <a href="/Anthropomorphic" title="Anthropomorphic">anthropomorphic</a> cartoon <a href="/Bear" title="Bear">bear</a> character known as <a href="/Sugar_Bear" title="Sugar Bear">Sugar Bear</a>, who sings the <a href="/Jingle" title="Jingle">jingle</a>, &#34;Can&#39;t get enough of that Golden Crisp.&#34; In commercials, Sugar Bear could turn into &#34;Super Bear&#34; upon eating it. This was dropped in the mid-late 1980s, where he would simply defeat his foes with a &#34;vitamin-packed punch&#34; as Sugar Bear. The jingle was also appended to include &#34;it&#39;s got the crunch with punch&#34;, although this was dropped in later years. Sugar Bear&#39;s voice, provided by <a href="/Gerry_Matthews" title="Gerry Matthews">Gerry Matthews</a> for forty years, was reminiscent of <a href="/Bing_Crosby" title="Bing Crosby">Bing Crosby</a> or <a href="/Dean_Martin" title="Dean Martin">Dean Martin</a>.</p>
<p>The focus of advertising shifted from targeting children to including parents, by downplaying the sweet taste (and associated sugar content).</p>

<p>In 1975, Super Orange Crisp was found to contain almost 71 percent sugar by dentist Ira Shannon, who became tired of seeing so many cavities in his patients&#39; mouths and bought hundreds of boxes of sugary breakfast cereal and analyzed the contents of each in a lab.&#60;ref name=&#34;cite3&#34;&#62;Moss, Michael. <i>Salt, Sugar, Fat: How the Food Giants Hooked Us</i>.

<p>In a 2008 comparison of the nutritional value of 27 cereals, U.S. magazine <i><a href="/Consumer_Reports" title="Consumer Reports">Consumer Reports</a></i> found that Post&#39;s Golden Crisp and <a href="/Kellogg_Company" title="Kellogg Company">Kellogg&#39;s</a> <a href="/Honey_Smacks" title="Honey Smacks">Honey Smacks</a> were the two brands with the highest <a href="/Sugar" title="Sugar">sugar</a> content—more than 50 percent (by weight)—commenting that one serving of this or other high-sugar cereals contained at least as much sugar &#34;as there is in a <a href="/Glaze_(cooking_technique)" title="Glaze (cooking technique)">glazed</a> <a href="/Doughnut" title="Doughnut">doughnut</a> from <a href="/Dunkin&#39;_Donuts" title="Dunkin&#39; Donuts">Dunkin&#39; Donuts</a>&#34;.&#60;ref name=&#34;:0&#34; /&#62; The two cereals are both sweetened <a href="/Puffed_wheat" title="Puffed wheat">puffed wheat</a>.
