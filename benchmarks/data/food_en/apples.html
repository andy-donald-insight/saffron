The <b>apple tree</b> (<i>Malus domestica</i>) is a <a href="/Deciduous" title="Deciduous">deciduous</a> <a href="/Tree" title="Tree">tree</a> in the <a href="/Rosaceae" title="Rosaceae">rose family</a> best known for its sweet, <a href="/Pome" title="Pome">pomaceous</a> <a href="/Fruit" title="Fruit">fruit</a>, the <b>apple</b>. It is <a href="/Agriculture" title="Agriculture">cultivated</a> worldwide as a <a href="/Fruit_tree" title="Fruit tree">fruit tree</a>, and is the most widely grown species in the <a href="/Genus" title="Genus">genus</a> <i><a href="/Malus" title="Malus">Malus</a>. </i>The tree originated in <a href="/Central_Asia" title="Central Asia">Central Asia</a>, where its wild ancestor, <i><a href="/Malus_sieversii" title="Malus sieversii">Malus sieversii</a></i>, is still found today. Apples have been grown for thousands of years in Asia and Europe, and were brought to North America by European colonists. Apples have <a href="/Religion" title="Religion">religious</a> and <a href="/Mythology" title="Mythology">mythological</a> significance in many cultures, including <a href="/Norse_mythology" title="Norse mythology">Norse</a>, <a href="/Greek_mythology" title="Greek mythology">Greek</a> and European Christian traditions.</p>
<p>Apple trees are large if grown from seed, but small if grafted onto roots (rootstock). There are more than 7,500 known <a href="/List_of_apple_cultivars" title="List of apple cultivars">cultivars of apples</a>, resulting in a range of desired characteristics. Different cultivars are bred for various tastes and uses, including <a href="/Cooking_apple" title="Cooking apple">cooking</a>, eating raw and <a href="/Apple_cider" title="Apple cider">cider</a> production. Apples are generally propagated by <a href="/Grafting" title="Grafting">grafting</a>, although wild apples grow readily from seed. Trees and fruit are prone to a number of <a href="/Fungus" title="Fungus">fungal</a>, <a href="/Bacteria" title="Bacteria">bacterial</a> and pest problems, which can be controlled by a number of <a href="/Organic_farming" title="Organic farming">organic</a> and non-organic means. In 2010, the fruit&#39;s <a href="/Genome" title="Genome">genome</a> was decoded as part of research on disease control and selective breeding in apple production.</p>
<p>About 80&#38;nbsp;million tons of apples were grown worldwide in 2013, and <a href="/China" title="China">China</a> produced almost half of this total.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|url=<a class="external free" href="http://faostat3.fao.org/download/Q/QC/E" rel="nofollow">http://faostat3.fao.org/download/Q/QC/E</a>|title=FAO production data|publisher=FAO|accessdate=2 July 2015}}&#60;/ref&#62; The <a href="/United_States" title="United States">United States</a> is the second-leading producer, with more than 6% of world production. <a href="/Turkey" title="Turkey">Turkey</a> is third, followed by <a href="/Italy" title="Italy">Italy</a>, <a href="/India" title="India">India</a> and <a href="/Poland" title="Poland">Poland</a>. Apples are often eaten raw, but can also be found in many prepared foods (especially desserts) and drinks. Many beneficial health effects are thought to result from eating apples; however, two types of allergies are attributed to various proteins found in the fruit.</p>

She points out that buckets of apples were found in the <a href="/Oseberg_ship" title="Oseberg ship">Oseberg ship</a> burial site in Norway, and that fruit and nuts (Iðunn having been described as being transformed into a nut in <i><a href="/Sk%C3%A1ldskaparm%C3%A1l" title="Skáldskaparmál">Skáldskaparmál</a></i>) have been found in the early graves of the <a href="/Germanic_peoples" title="Germanic peoples">Germanic peoples</a> in England and elsewhere on the continent of Europe, which may have had a symbolic meaning, and that nuts are still a recognized symbol of <a href="/Fertility" title="Fertility">fertility</a> in southwest England.&#60;ref name=&#34;autogenerated1&#34;/&#62;</p>
<p>Davidson notes a connection between apples and the <a href="/Vanir" title="Vanir">Vanir</a>, a tribe of gods associated with <a href="/Fertility" title="Fertility">fertility</a> in Norse mythology, citing an instance of eleven &#34;golden apples&#34; being given to woo the beautiful <a href="/Ger%C3%B0r" title="Gerðr">Gerðr</a> by <a href="/Sk%C3%ADrnir" title="Skírnir">Skírnir</a>, who was acting as messenger for the major Vanir god <a href="/Freyr" title="Freyr">Freyr</a> in stanzas 19 and 20 of <i><a href="/Sk%C3%ADrnism%C3%A1l" title="Skírnismál">Skírnismál</a></i>. Davidson also notes a further connection between fertility and apples in Norse mythology in chapter 2 of the <i><a href="/V%C3%B6lsunga_saga" title="Völsunga saga">Völsunga saga</a></i> when the major goddess <a href="/Frigg" title="Frigg">Frigg</a> sends King <a href="/Rerir" title="Rerir">Rerir</a> an apple after he prays to Odin for a child, Frigg&#39;s messenger (in the guise of a crow) drops the apple in his lap as he sits atop a <a href="/Tumulus" title="Tumulus">mound</a>.&#60;ref name=&#34;DAVIDSON165-166&#34;/&#62; Rerir&#39;s wife&#39;s consumption of the apple results in a six-year pregnancy and the <a href="/Caesarean_section" title="Caesarean section">Caesarean section</a> birth of their son—the hero <a href="/V%C3%B6lsung" title="Völsung">Völsung</a>.&#60;ref name=&#34;DAVIDSONROLES146-147&#34;/&#62;</p>
<p>Further, Davidson points out the &#34;strange&#34; phrase &#34;Apples of <a href="/Hel_(location)" title="Hel (location)">Hel</a>&#34; used in an 11th-century poem by the <a href="/Skald" title="Skald">skald</a> Thorbiorn Brúnarson. She states this may imply that the apple was thought of by Brúnarson as the food of the dead. Further, Davidson notes that the potentially Germanic goddess <a href="/Nehalennia" title="Nehalennia">Nehalennia</a> is sometimes depicted with apples and that parallels exist in early Irish stories. Davidson asserts that while cultivation of the apple in Northern Europe extends back to at least the time of the <a href="/Roman_Empire" title="Roman Empire">Roman Empire</a> and came to Europe from the <a href="/Near_East" title="Near East">Near East</a>, the native varieties of apple trees growing in Northern Europe are small and bitter. Davidson concludes that in the figure of Iðunn &#34;we must have a dim reflection of an old symbol: that of the guardian goddess of the life-giving fruit of the other world.&#34;&#60;ref name=&#34;autogenerated1&#34; /&#62;</p>

In the wild, apples grow readily from seeds. However, like most perennial fruits, apples are ordinarily propagated asexually by <a href="/Grafting" title="Grafting">grafting</a>.

<p>Cultivars vary in their yield and the ultimate size of the tree, even when grown on the same rootstock. Some cultivars, if left unpruned, will grow very large, which allows them to bear much more fruit, but makes harvesting very difficult. Depending on the tree density (number of trees planted per unit surface area), mature trees typically bear {{convert|40|-|200|kg|lb|abbr=on}} of apples each year, though productivity can be close to zero in poor years. Apples are harvested using three-point ladders that are designed to fit amongst the branches.

<p>Crops ripen at different times of the year according to the variety of apple. Varieties that yield their crop in the summer include Gala, Golden Supreme, McIntosh, Transparent, Primate, Sweet Bough, and Duchess; fall producers include Fuji, Jonagold, Golden Delicious, Red Delicious, Chenango, Gravenstein, Wealthy, McIntosh, Snow, and Blenheim; winter producers include Winesap, Granny Smith, King, Wagener, <a href="/Swazie_(apple)" title="Swazie (apple)">Swayzie</a>, Greening, and Tolman Sweet.&#60;ref name=&#34;lawrence122&#34;/&#62;</p>

Apple trees are susceptible to a number of <a href="/Fungus" title="Fungus">fungal</a> and <a href="/Bacterium" title="Bacterium">bacterial</a> diseases and insect pests. Many commercial orchards pursue an aggressive program of chemical sprays to maintain high fruit quality, tree health, and high yields. A trend in orchard management is the use of organic methods.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} These prohibit the use of synthetic pesticides, though some older pesticides are allowed. <a href="/Organic_farming" title="Organic farming">Organic</a> methods include, for instance, introducing its natural predator to reduce the population of a particular pest.</p>
<p>A wide range of pests and diseases can affect the plant; three of the more common diseases/pests are mildew, aphids and apple scab.
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/Mildew" title="Mildew">Mildew</a>: which is characterized by light grey powdery patches appearing on the leaves, shoots and flowers, normally in spring. The flowers will turn a creamy yellow color and will not develop correctly. This can be treated in a manner not dissimilar from treating <a href="/Botryotinia" title="Botryotinia">Botrytis</a>; eliminating the conditions which caused the disease in the first place and burning the infected plants are among the recommended actions to take.&#60;ref name=&#34;pest4&#34;/&#62;</li>
<li><a href="/Aphids" title="Aphids">Aphids</a>: There are five species of aphids commonly found on apples: apple grain aphid, rosy apple aphid, apple aphid, spirea aphid and the woolly apple aphid. The aphid species can be identified by their color, the time of year when they are present and by differences in the cornicles, which are small paired projections from the rear of aphids.&#60;ref name=pest4/&#62; Aphids feed on foliage using needle-like mouth parts to suck out plant juices. When present in high numbers, certain species reduce tree growth and vigor.&#60;ref name=pest5&#62;{{cite web</li>

In other areas, such as the Mediterranean, some individuals have adverse reactions to apples because of their similarity to peaches.&#60;ref name=EU/&#62; This form of apple allergy also includes OAS, but often has more severe symptoms, such as vomiting, abdominal pain and <a href="/Urticaria" title="Urticaria">urticaria</a>, and can be life-threatening. Individuals with this form of allergy can also develop reactions to other fruits and nuts. Cooking does not break down the protein causing this particular reaction, so affected individuals can eat neither raw nor cooked apples.

The <a href="/Proverb" title="Proverb">proverb</a> &#34;<i>An apple a day keeps the doctor away</i>&#34;, addressing the health effects of the fruit, dates from 19th century Wales according to Caroline Taggart, author of “An Apple a Day: Old-Fashioned Proverbs and Why They Still Work.” The original phrase, Taggart said, was, ‘‘Eat an apple on going to bed, and you’ll keep the doctor from earning his bread.” In the 19th century and early 20th, the phrase evolved to “an apple a day, no doctor to pay” and “an apple a days sends the doctor away,” while the phrasing now commonly used was first recorded in 1922.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite book|last=Pollan|first=Michael|title=The Botany of Desire: a Plant&#39;s-eye View of the World|year=2001|ISBN=0375501290|page=22, cf. p. 9 &#38; 50|publisher=Random House|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.pbs.org/thebotanyofdesire/" rel="nofollow">http://www.pbs.org/thebotanyofdesire/</a>|accessdate=3 January 2015}}&#60;/ref&#62;
