The soup should be brought slowly to a boil and then simmered in a covered pot on a very low flame for one to three hours, adding water if necessary. A clearer broth is achieved by skimming the drops of fat off the top of the soup as it is cooking, first bringing the chicken to boil from a pot of cold water and discarding the water before continuing, or straining it through a strainer or cheesecloth. <a href="/Saffron" title="Saffron">Saffron</a> or <a href="/Turmeric" title="Turmeric">turmeric</a> are sometimes added as a yellow colorant. Then, the chicken can be shredded by hand and stored in the refrigerator until ready for use in the soup.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Terminology">Terminology</span></h2>
<p>Several terms are used when referring to chicken soups:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Chicken <a href="/Stock_(food)" title="Stock (food)">stock</a></b> is a liquid in which chicken bones and vegetables have been simmered for the purpose of serving as an ingredient in more complex dishes. Chicken stock is not usually served as is. Stock can be made with less palatable parts of the chicken, such as feet, necks or bones: the higher bone content in these parts contributes more <a href="/Gelatin" title="Gelatin">gelatin</a> to the liquid, making it a better base for sauces. Stock can be reboiled and reused as the basis for a new stock. <a href="/Bouillon_cube" title="Bouillon cube">Bouillon cubes</a> or <a href="/Soup_base" title="Soup base">soup base</a> are often used instead of chicken stock prepared from scratch.</li>
<li><b>Chicken <a href="/Broth" title="Broth">broth</a></b> is the liquid part of chicken soup. Broth can be served as is, or used as stock, or served as soup with noodles. Broth can be milder than stock, does not need to be boiled as long, and can be made with meatier chicken parts.</li>
<li><b>Chicken <a href="/Bouillon_(broth)" title="Bouillon (broth)">bouillon</a></b> or <b>bouillon de poulet</b> is the French term for chicken broth.</li>
<li><b>Chicken <a href="/Consomm%C3%A9" title="Consommé">consommé</a></b> is a more refined chicken broth. It is usually strained to perfect clarity, and reduced to concentrate it.</li>
<li><b>Chicken <a href="/Stew" title="Stew">stew</a></b> is a more substantial dish with a higher ratio of solids to broth. The broth may also be thickened toward a <a href="/Gravy" title="Gravy">gravy</a>-like consistency with a <a href="/Roux" title="Roux">roux</a> or by adding <a href="/Flour" title="Flour">flour</a>-based <a href="/Dumpling" title="Dumpling">dumplings</a> (<a href="/Matzah_ball" title="Matzah ball">matzah balls</a> do not have the same thickening effect).</li>
<li>While any soup in which chicken has been simmered or with a chicken stock base is, strictly speaking, a chicken soup, <b>chicken soup</b>, unless qualified, implies that the soup is served as a thin broth, possibly with pieces of meat, vegetables, noodles, rice or dumplings.</li>
<li><b><a href="/List_of_soups#Cream" title="List of soups">Cream of chicken soup</a></b> is a thick, creamy soup made with chicken stock and pieces combined with milk and/or cream and flour which may or may not contain vegetable pieces depending on the recipe.</li>

<p>In <a href="/Bulgaria" title="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a>, chicken soup is often seasoned with <a href="/Lemon" title="Lemon">lemon juice</a> or <a href="/Vinegar" title="Vinegar">vinegar</a>.
Very often people use to add at the end of the cooking a mixture of yogurt and egg to make the soup denser and creamier, by combining one egg with 100–150&#38;nbsp;ml yogurt in a deep cup and mixing it until smooth. This gets added slowly by continuously stirring to the soup after the pot was taken from the stove to prevent curdling. Finely fresh chopped parsley would be added before serving. {{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}</p>

Chicken soup in the Philippines is called <i>sopas</i> and has some western influences in it. While there are many variations in the recipe, it usually contains chicken strips in broth, onions, vegetables (mainly carrots, cabbage and celery), and macaroni noodles. It is cooked with evaporated milk to give it richer flavor. <i>Sopas</i> is normally associated with the cold, rainy season in the Philippines, and may thus be regarded as local comfort food.</p>
<p>Another chicken soup is called &#34;mami&#34; which its style derives from its other Asian neighboring countries, especially East Asia and normally served with sliced chicken, broth, noodles, chopped vegetables. Mami is also associated with the cold, rainy season as well.</p>
