<p>The cake is often made with <a href="/Zante_currant" title="Zante currant">currants</a>, <a href="/Sultana_(grape)" title="Sultana (grape)">sultanas</a> and <a href="/Almond" title="Almond">almonds</a>; sometimes, fruit peel may be added to it. The cake originated in nineteenth-century Scotland, and was originally made as a mass-produced cake by the <a href="/Marmalade" title="Marmalade">marmalade</a> company called Keiller&#39;s. <a href="/Keiller&#39;s_marmalade" title="Keiller&#39;s marmalade">Keiller&#39;s marmalade</a> company first produced the cake commercially and have been claimed to be the originators of the term &#34;Dundee cake&#34;.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} However, similar fruit cakes were produced across Scotland. A popular story is that <a href="/Mary_Queen_of_Scots" title="Mary Queen of Scots">Mary Queen of Scots</a> did not like <a href="/Candied_fruit" title="Candied fruit">glace cherries</a> in her cakes, so the cake was first made for her, as a fruit cake that used blanched almonds and not cherries.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external free" href="http://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/Food/article2714443.ece&#60;/ref&#38;gt" rel="nofollow">http://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/Food/article2714443.ece&#60;/ref&#38;gt</a>; The top of the cake is typically decorated with concentric circles of almonds. Today, the cakes are often sold in <a href="/Supermarket" title="Supermarket">supermarkets</a> throughout the <a href="/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>.</p>
