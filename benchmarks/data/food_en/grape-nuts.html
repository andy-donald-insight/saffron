<b>Grape-Nuts</b> is a <a href="/Breakfast_cereal" title="Breakfast cereal">breakfast cereal</a> developed in 1897 by <a href="/C._W._Post" title="C. W. Post">C. W. Post</a>, a former patient and later competitor of the 19th-century breakfast food innovator, Dr. <a href="/John_Harvey_Kellogg" title="John Harvey Kellogg">John Harvey Kellogg</a>. Despite the name, the cereal contains neither <a href="/Grape" title="Grape">grapes</a> nor <a href="/Nut_(fruit)" title="Nut (fruit)">nuts</a>; it is made with <a href="/Wheat" title="Wheat">wheat</a> and <a href="/Barley" title="Barley">barley</a>. Post believed that <a href="/Glucose" title="Glucose">glucose</a> (which he called &#34;grape sugar&#34;) formed in the baking process. This, combined with the nutty flavor of the cereal, is said to have inspired its name. Another explanation originates from employees at <a href="/Post_Holdings" title="Post Holdings">Post</a>, who claim that the cereal got its name due to a resemblance to grape seeds, or grape &#34;nuts.&#34; The cereal originally prepared by C. W. Post when developing the product was a batter that came from the oven as a rigid sheet. He then broke the sheet into pieces and ran them through a coffee grinder to produce the &#34;nut&#34; sized kernels.</p>

<p>Grape-Nuts was initially marketed as a natural cereal that could enhance health and vitality, and as a &#34;food for brain and nerve centres.&#34; &#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|url=<a class="external free" href="http://nyhistory.org/exhibit/box-food-6" rel="nofollow">http://nyhistory.org/exhibit/box-food-6</a>|title=New York Historical Society|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&#60;/ref&#62; Its lightweight and compact nature, nutritional value, and resistance to spoilage made it a popular food for exploration and expedition groups in the 1920s and 1930s. In World War II, Grape-Nuts was a component of the lightweight <a href="/Jungle_ration" title="Jungle ration">Jungle ration</a> used by some <a href="/United_States_Armed_Forces" title="United States Armed Forces">U.S.</a> and <a href="/Allies_of_World_War_II" title="Allies of World War II">Allied Forces</a> in wartime operations before 1944.&#60;ref&#62;Kearny, Cresson H. (Major), <i>Jungle Snafus...And Remedies</i>, Oregon Institute (1996), pp. 290â€“291&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>A 1939 <a href="/Ad_campaign" title="Ad campaign">ad campaign</a> by cartoonist <a href="/Walter_Hoban" title="Walter Hoban">Walter Hoban</a> continued his <i><a href="/Jerry_on_the_Job" title="Jerry on the Job">Jerry on the Job</a></i> <a href="/Comic_strip" title="Comic strip">comic strip</a> in <i><a href="/Woman&#39;s_Day" title="Woman&#39;s Day">Woman&#39;s Day</a></i> magazine and daily newspaper comics pages.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|url=<a class="external free" href="http://graphic-design.tjs-labs.com/gallery-view?product=grape%25nuts" rel="nofollow">http://graphic-design.tjs-labs.com/gallery-view?product=grape%25nuts</a>|title=Gallery of Graphic Design|accessdate=12 August 2012}}&#60;/ref&#62; General Foods also marketed Grape-Nuts through a comics-style advertising campaign (a trailblazer in this regard) featuring a character named Little Alby, who gained inordinate strength after consuming a bowl of Grape-Nuts.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://cartoonician.com/funny-business-the-rise-and-fall-of-johnstone-and-cushing/" rel="nofollow">&#34;Funny Business: The Rise and Fall of Johnstone and Cushing,&#34; <i>Hogan&#39;s Alley</i>, 1999</a>&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>In the 1960s, advertising promoted Grape-Nuts as the cereal that &#34;fills you up, not out&#34;. Brand users, particularly mother/daughter look-alikes, were shown engaged in fitness activities such as tennis, horseback riding, skiing, and swimming. Also appearing during the &#34;fills you up, not out&#34; campaign were Andy Griffith and Don Knotts as the characters from &#34;The Andy Griffith Show,&#34; Sheriff Andy Taylor and Deputy Barney Fife.</p>
<p>This ad campaign produced one television commercial, which aired on television in 1968, that featured a <a href="/Catchphrase" title="Catchphrase">catchphrase</a> that became a target for numerous sketches and satires in  <a href="/Mass_media" title="Mass media">media</a>. Spanning the ensuing two decades and beyond, &#34;Oh no, Mrs. Burke! I thought you were Dale!&#34; was parodied on television variety show sketches, in the film <i><a href="/The_Kentucky_Fried_Movie" title="The Kentucky Fried Movie">The Kentucky Fried Movie</a></i> and in many <i><a href="/Mystery_Science_Theater_3000" title="Mystery Science Theater 3000">Mystery Science Theater 3000</a></i> episodes, fans continue to discuss the origin of this &#34;riff&#34; and have even developed products that feature the text, &#34;I thought you were Dale.&#34;</p>
<p>A subsequent ad campaign generated another catchphrase, as <a href="/Euell_Gibbons" title="Euell Gibbons">Euell Gibbons</a> became the spokesperson for the brand, promoting Grape-Nuts as the &#34;Back to Nature Cereal&#34;. The line &#34;Ever eat a pine tree? Many parts are edible&#34; drew attention to the product from consumers, as well as from comedians.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}</p>
<p>Grape-Nuts is credited as the first widespread product to use a coupon in sales promotion when C.W. Post Company offered a penny-off coupon to get people to try their cereal in the late 1890s.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}</p>
<p>At one time, Grape-Nuts was the seventh most popular cold breakfast cereal, but sales declined as Post was sold from one company to another. Circa 2005 it held less than 1% of the market. About this time the formula was changed:  The husks from milled grain were ground into the flour and the cereal was pitched as &#34;whole grain,&#34; albeit at the cost of roughening the cereal&#39;s texture and detracting significantly from <a href="/Mouth_feel" title="Mouth feel">mouth feel</a>{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}. The addition of vitamins and minerals allowed it to qualify for food-stamp programs.&#60;ref&#62;Newman, B., Wall Street Journal, June 1, 2009&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
