<p>Farfalle come in several sizes, but have a distinctive <a href="/Bow_tie" title="Bow tie">bow tie</a> shape. Usually, the farfalle are formed from a rectangle or oval of pasta with two sides trimmed in a ruffled edge, and the center pinched together to make the unusual shape of the pasta. They are sometimes ridged, known as <i>farfalle rigate</i>. Different varieties are available: plain, tomato, and spinach. These are often sold together in a mix, recalling the colors of the <a href="/Flag_of_Italy" title="Flag of Italy">flag of Italy</a>. Though usable with most sauces, farfalle are best suited to cream and tomato dishes.</p>
<p>In addition to plain and whole wheat varieties, as with any pasta, other colours can be made by mixing other ingredients into the dough, which also affects the flavour; for example, beetroot for red, spinach for green and cuttlefish ink for black.</p>
<p>A larger variation of farfalle is known as <i>farfallone</i>, while there is a miniature version called <i>farfalline</i>.</p>
<p>In <a href="/Modena" title="Modena">Modena</a>, farfalle are known as <i>strichetti</i>.</p>
<p>Farfalle are not related to the similar-sounding <a href="/Farfel" title="Farfel">farfel</a>, a kind of egg-barley pasta in <a href="/Jewish_cuisine" title="Jewish cuisine">Jewish cuisine</a>.</p>
