A <b>fruit snack</b> is a <a href="/Processed_food" title="Processed food">processed food</a> eaten as a <a href="/Snack_food" title="Snack food">snack</a> in the United States.

<p>Well-known manufacturers of chewy fruit snacks include Promotion In Motion (<a href="/Welch&#39;s" title="Welch&#39;s">Welch&#39;s</a> brand), <a href="/Kellogg&#39;s" title="Kellogg&#39;s">Kellogg&#39;s</a>,  <a href="/General_Mills" title="General Mills">General Mills</a>&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external autonumber" href="http://www.complex.com/city-guide/2013/07/greatest-fruit-snacks-of-all-time/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>&#60;/ref&#62;  and <a href="/Betty_Crocker" title="Betty Crocker">Betty Crocker</a>. </p>
<p>Fruit snacks gained popularity from their convenience and candy-like taste. Most are stored in a simple plastic packaging that does not need to be refrigerated; therefore they can be taken virtually anywhere. However, they do have an <a href="/Shelf_life" title="Shelf life">expiration date</a>. Fruit snacks range in the amount of fruit content. Some, like Welch&#39;s, contain fruit purees. Others only have trace amounts of <a href="/Juice" title="Juice">juice</a>, in addition to sugar. </p>
<p><a href="/Fruit_leather" title="Fruit leather">Fruit leathers</a> differ in that they have a different shape.  The ingredients may be the same, or they may made primarily from pureed, dried fruit and concentrated, high-sugar fruit juice.</p>

<p><a href="/Kellogg_Company" title="Kellogg Company">Kellogg&#39;s</a> created &#34;Fruit Winders&#34; in the UK, which is similar to General Mills&#39; Fruit Roll-Ups, only in fewer flavors.  </p>
<p>Fruit Winders were introduced in the UK and Ireland in 2001 under the Kellogg&#39;s brand. The product was first called &#34;Real Fruit Winders&#34;, which was later changed to &#34;Screamin Fruit Winders&#34; before being changed finally to &#34;Kellogg&#39;s Fruit Winders&#34;. When the product first came out, the flavors were Orange, Strawberry and Blackcurrant, with Apple introduced shortly after. </p>
<p>Later, a public call-in contest was held where people would vote for a new Fruit Winders flavor. The choices were Tropical, Raspberry and Lemon. The winning flavor was Tropical, but Raspberry and Lemon were introduced later on afterwards. In 2006, Fruit Winders discontinued the Orange, Tropical, Raspberry and Lemon flavors along with the spin-off products, and put Apple and Blackcurrant into the Doubles brand, leaving Strawberry the only flavour to be sold in single packets. </p>
<p>The spin-off products were a squeezable product called <b>Screamin Fruit Squidgers</b> and gummy candies with a liquid centre, which were called <b>Screamin Fruit Spurters</b>.  These were discontinued in 2006. </p>
<p>The television adverts for Fruit Winders showed a fruit with eyes and a mouth being winded into a Fruit Winder by a character that was a humanoid version of the fruit it was harming, these ads often had the slogan &#34;Unwind the fruity fun, FOREVER!&#34;. On the paper attached to the Fruit Winder, a comic strip is shown, it shows a comic of the characters winding the fruit. Every Winder has a different story or way of being winded.</p>
