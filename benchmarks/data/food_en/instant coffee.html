<b>Instant coffee</b>, also called <b>soluble coffee</b>, <b>coffee crystals</b> and <b>coffee powder</b>, is a beverage derived from brewed <a href="/Coffee_bean" title="Coffee bean">coffee beans</a>. Instant coffee is commercially prepared by either <a href="/Freeze-drying" title="Freeze-drying">freeze-drying</a> or <a href="/Spray_drying" title="Spray drying">spray drying</a>, after which it can be rehydrated.

<p>Instant coffee is available in powder or granulated form contained in glass jars, sachets, or tins. The user controls the strength of the resulting product, by adding less or more powder to the water, ranging from thin &#34;coffee water&#34; to very strong and almost syrupy coffee.</p>

<p>The use of instant coffee also extends to both general cooking and even <a href="/Haute_cuisine" title="Haute cuisine">haute cuisine</a>, because in many circumstances it is easier to apply. Coffee cake, with its coffee icing, is a staple of parties and festivities in its original New Zealand, in Australia, and throughout Britain. Instant coffee easily flavours ice-cream and sundaes, and is often mixed with equal quantities of chocolate. Certain haute cuisine recipes call for instant coffee and paprika or turmeric rubs onto chicken, turkey, or even venison. Chefs often note that in these cases, while ground beans offer a purer flavour to the aficionado, instant coffee allows the permeation of flavour to be more evenly spread and consistent.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Production">Production</span></h2>
<p>As with regular coffee, the green coffee bean itself is first roasted to bring out flavour and aroma. Rotating cylinders containing the green beans and hot combustion gases are used in most roasting plants. When the bean temperature reaches {{convert|165|°C}} the roasting begins, accompanied by a popping sound similar to that produced by popcorn. These batch cylinders take about 8–15 minutes to complete roasting with about 25–75% efficiency. Coffee roasting using a fluidized bed only takes from thirty seconds to four minutes, and it operates at lower temperatures which allows greater retention of the coffee bean aroma and flavor.</p>
<p>The beans are then ground finely. Grinding reduces the beans to {{convert|0.5|-|1.1|mm|adj=on}} pieces in order to allow the coffee to be put in solution with water for the drying stage. Sets of scored rollers designed to crush rather than cut the bean are used.</p>
<p>Once roasted and ground, the coffee is dissolved in water. This stage is called extraction. Water is added in 5–10 percolation columns at temperatures of {{convert|155|to|180|°C}}; this concentrates the coffee solution to about 15–30% coffee by mass. After filtration, this may be further concentrated before the drying process begins by either <a href="/Vacuum_evaporation" title="Vacuum evaporation">vacuum evaporation</a> or freeze concentration.</p>

<p>The basic principle of <a href="/Freeze_drying" title="Freeze drying">freeze drying</a> is the removal of water by <a href="/Sublimation_(chemistry)" title="Sublimation (chemistry)">sublimation</a>.</p>
<p>Since the mass production of instant coffee began in post-WWII America, freeze-drying has grown in popularity to become a common method. Although it is more expensive, it generally results in a higher-quality product.</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="/Agglomerate" title="Agglomerate">Agglomerated</a> wet coffee granules are rapidly frozen (slow freezing leads to large ice crystals and a porous product and can also affect the colour of the coffee granules).</li>
<li>Frozen coffee is placed in the drying chamber, often on metal trays.</li>
<li>A vacuum is created within the chamber. The strength of the vacuum is critical in the speed of the drying and therefore the quality of the product. Care must be taken to produce a vacuum of suitable strength.</li>
<li>The drying chamber is warmed, most commonly by <a href="/Thermal_radiation" title="Thermal radiation">radiation</a> but <a href="/Heat_conduction" title="Heat conduction">conduction</a> is used in some plants and <a href="/Convection" title="Convection">convection</a> has been proposed in some small pilot plants.

<li>Condensation&#38;nbsp;— the previously frozen water in the coffee granules expands to ten times its previous volume. The removal of this water vapor from the chamber is vitally important, making the condenser the most critical and expensive component in a freeze-drying plant.</li>
<li>The freeze-dried granules are removed from the chamber and packaged.</li>

<p>Spray drying is preferred to freeze drying in some cases because of its economy, shorter drying times, and the fine, rounded particles it produces.</p>
<p>Spray drying produces spherical particles about {{convert|300|µm}} size with a density of 0.22 g/cm³ (ref 2). To achieve this, nozzle atomization is used. Various ways of nozzle atomization can be used each having its own advantages and disadvantages. High speed rotating wheels operating at speeds of about 20,000 rpm are able to process up to 60,000 pounds (27 tonnes) of solution per hour (ref 3). The use of <a href="/Spray_wheel" title="Spray wheel">spray wheels</a> requires that the drying towers have a wide radius to avoid the atomized droplets collecting onto the drying chamber walls.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Completed in 5–30 seconds (dependent on factors such as heat, size of particle, and diameter of chamber).</li>
<li>Moisture content change: IN = 75-85% OUT = 3-3.5%</li>
<li>Air temperature: IN = 270&#38;nbsp;°C OUT = 110&#38;nbsp;°C</li>
</ul>

<p>One drawback with spray drying is that the particles it produces are too fine to be used effectively by the consumer; they must first be either steam-fused in towers similar to spray dryers or by <a href="/Belt_agglomeration" title="Belt agglomeration">belt agglomeration</a> to produce particles of suitable size.</p>
