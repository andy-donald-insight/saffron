<b>Cumberland sausage</b> is a form of <a href="/Sausage" title="Sausage">sausage</a> that originated in the ancient county of <a href="/Cumberland" title="Cumberland">Cumberland</a>, <a href="/England" title="England">England</a>, now part of <a href="/Cumbria" title="Cumbria">Cumbria</a>. They are traditionally very long up to 21 inches (50 cm), and sold rolled in a flat, circular coil, but within western Cumbria they are more often served in long curved lengths.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} Sometimes they are made shorter, like ordinary British sausages, and sometimes they are coated in breadcrumbs.</p>
<p>The meat is pork, and seasonings are prepared from a variety of <a href="/Spices" title="Spices">spices</a> and <a href="/Herb" title="Herb">herbs</a>, though the flavour palate is commonly dominated by <a href="/Black_pepper" title="Black pepper">pepper</a>, both black and white, in contrast to the more herb-dominated flavours of sausage varieties such as those from <a href="/Lincolnshire_sausage" title="Lincolnshire sausage">Lincolnshire</a>. There are traditionally no colourings or preservatives added. The distinctive feature is that the meat is chopped, not minced, giving the sausage a chunky, meaty texture.</p>
<p>In March 2011, the &#34;Traditional Cumberland sausage&#34; was granted <a href="/Protected_Geographical_Status" title="Protected Geographical Status">Protected Geographical Indication</a> (PGI) status.&#60;ref name=defra11&#62;{{cite web | url =<a class="external free" href="http://ww2.defra.gov.uk/news/2011/03/18/cumberland-sausages/" rel="nofollow">http://ww2.defra.gov.uk/news/2011/03/18/cumberland-sausages/</a> | publisher = <a href="/Department_for_Environment%2C_Food_and_Rural_Affairs" title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs</a> | title = Traditional Cumberland sausages win protected status in Europe</p>

<p>Up until the 1950s, most farms and many households kept a pig as part of their regular husbandry and means of self-sufficiency. Over time a local variety of pig was bred that was suited to the cooler and wetter climate in Cumbria. It was known as the <a href="/Cumberland_Pig" title="Cumberland Pig">Cumberland Pig</a>, and this is where the product takes its name from.&#60;ref&#62;Anglo-Saxon tradition and the Celtic Spiral, <a class="external free" href="http://www.CumberlandSausage.eu" rel="nofollow">http://www.CumberlandSausage.eu</a> historic Briton tradition in Cumberland&#60;/ref&#62;  The Cumberland pig was a heavy pig with an upturned snout and ears that flopped forwards. Its meat had a distinctive quality and flavour that was unique. Heavy boned, slow to mature, and extremely hardy, the creature became a symbol of the region, but was allowed to die out in the early 1960s at <a href="/Bothel%2C_Cumbria" title="Bothel, Cumbria">Bothel</a>.&#60;ref name=&#34;sm&#34;/&#62;  As an alternative, <a href="/Large_Black_pig" title="Large Black pig">Large Black</a>, <a href="/Gloucestershire_Old_Spots" title="Gloucestershire Old Spots">Gloucestershire Old Spots</a> and Welsh breeds can be used.  The Cumberland pig breed has now been revived, although not officially recognised by the <a href="/Rare_Breeds_Survival_Trust" title="Rare Breeds Survival Trust">Rare Breeds Survival Trust</a>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>
<p>The Cumberland sausage has been a local speciality in Cumbria for around 500 years.&#60;ref name=&#34;sm&#34;&#62;{{cite web|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.steadmans-butchers.co.uk/sausages/history.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.steadmans-butchers.co.uk/sausages/history.htm</a>|title=Sausage History|work=steadmans-butchers.co.uk}}&#60;/ref&#62; It is not known how the Cumberland sausage came to acquire its special shape and taste. Historically, the sausage was more highly seasoned than it is today. This is largely attributed to the influx of spices into Whitehaven during the 18th century. During this time Cumbria was introduced to ginger, black pepper and nutmeg, as well as other foodstuffs such as molasses, sugar and rum. Many of these ingredients have been incorporated into some of Cumbria&#39;s local specialities, such as the spicy Cumberland Sausage.&#60;ref name=&#34;sm&#34;/&#62;</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Ingredients">Ingredients</span></h2>
<p>Most sausages are divided into links but the Cumberland sausage is one continuous rope-like coil. The sausage is typically filled with coarsely chopped pork and black pepper, and sometimes other ingredients such as herbs and other spices. The meat content is usually 85% - 98%.&#60;ref name=&#34;sm&#34;/&#62;  However, the popularity of the Cumberland sausage has become so widespread in recent years that many large food producers started to mass-produce it and sacrificed its original quality with a meat content as low as 45%, containing emulsified rather than coarse-cut meat and being sold in thin links rather than thick continuous lengths.&#60;ref name=&#34;sm&#34;/&#62; </p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Protected_Geographical_Status">Protected Geographical Status</span></h2>
<p>There was a campaign by some Cumbrian butchers&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external free" href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/foodfarm/food/industry/regional/foodname/products/documents/cumberland-sausage-pgi.pdf&#60;/ref&#38;gt" rel="nofollow">http://www.defra.gov.uk/foodfarm/food/industry/regional/foodname/products/documents/cumberland-sausage-pgi.pdf&#60;/ref&#38;gt</a>; and meat manufacturers to have Cumberland sausage placed under a <a href="/Protected_Geographical_Status" title="Protected Geographical Status">Protected Geographical Status</a> classification under <a href="/European_Commission" title="European Commission">European Commission</a> rules. This would provide the same protection as is afforded to <a href="/Parma_ham" title="Parma ham">Parma ham</a> and <a href="/Feta_cheese" title="Feta cheese">Feta cheese</a>. The association suggested that the criteria for the sausages should include: a high meat content of more than 80%; the sausage to be coiled, not linked; a wider diameter than conventional sausages; and a rough-cut texture. The association claims the sausage should be prepared in Cumbria. While individual butchers have their own recipes, they are generally more highly seasoned than traditional sausages, possibly due to the historical import of spices at <a href="/Whitehaven" title="Whitehaven">Whitehaven</a>. </p>
<p>There was, however, opposition to the campaign in its present form, which essentially calls for the modification of the proposition to reduce the region of the proposed protection from the Post 1974 &#39;administrative&#39; County of Cumbria - which incorporates Cumberland, <a href="/Westmorland" title="Westmorland">Westmorland</a>, and <a href="/Furness" title="Furness">Lancashire &#39;north of the Sands&#39;</a> but without abolishing the original counties - to the Traditional County of Cumberland, on native grounds, with provisions including the native right for natives to continue to manufacture the sausage elsewhere. </p>
<p>In March 2011, Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) status was granted to the name &#34;Traditional Cumberland sausage&#34;. To display the PGI mark, the sausage must be produced, processed and prepared in Cumbria and have a meat content of at least 80%. It must include seasoning and be sold in a long coil.&#60;ref name=defra11/&#62;&#60;ref&#62;{{cite news| url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cumbria-12777166" rel="nofollow">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cumbria-12777166</a> | work=BBC News | title=Cumberland sausage wins protected status | date=18 March 2011}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
