<p><b>Gumbo</b> is a <a href="/Stew" title="Stew">stew</a> that originated in southern <a href="/Louisiana" title="Louisiana">Louisiana</a> during the 18th century. It consists primarily of a strongly-flavored <a href="/Stock_(food)" title="Stock (food)">stock</a>, meat or shellfish, a thickener, and the vegetable <a href="/Holy_trinity_(cuisine)" title="Holy trinity (cuisine)">holy trinity</a> of <a href="/Celery" title="Celery">celery</a>, <a href="/Bell_pepper" title="Bell pepper">bell peppers</a>, and <a href="/Onions" title="Onions">onions</a>. Gumbo is often categorized by the type of thickener used: the African vegetable <a href="/Okra" title="Okra">okra</a>, the <a href="/Choctaw" title="Choctaw">Choctaw</a> spice <a href="/Fil%C3%A9_powder" title="Filé powder">filé powder</a> (dried and ground <a href="/Sassafras_albidum" title="Sassafras albidum">sassafras</a> leaves), or <a href="/Roux" title="Roux">roux</a>, the French base made of flour and fat. The dish likely derived its name from either the <a href="/Bantu_languages" title="Bantu languages">Bantu</a> word for okra (<i>ki ngombo</i>) or the Choctaw word for filé (<i>kombo</i>). </p>
<p>Several different varieties exist.  <a href="/Louisiana_Creole_people" title="Louisiana Creole people">Creole</a> gumbo generally contains shellfish, tomatoes, and a thickener.  <a href="/Cajun" title="Cajun">Cajun</a> gumbo is generally based on a dark roux and is spicier, with either shellfish or fowl.  Sausage or ham are often added to gumbos of either variety.  After the base is prepared, vegetables are cooked down, and then meat is added.  The dish simmers for a minimum of three hours, with shellfish and some spices added near the end.  If desired, filé powder is added after the pot is removed from heat.  Gumbo is traditionally served over rice.  A third, lesser-known variety, the meatless gumbo z&#39;herbes, is essentially a gumbo of slow-cooked <a href="/Leaf_vegetable" title="Leaf vegetable">greens</a> sometimes thickened with roux, with rice served on the side.</p>
<p>The dish combines ingredients and culinary practices of several cultures, including French, Spanish, German, West African, and Choctaw. Gumbo may have been based on traditional West African or native dishes, or may be a derivation of the French dish <a href="/Bouillabaisse" title="Bouillabaisse">bouillabaisse</a>. It was first described in 1802, and was listed in various cookbooks in the latter half of the 19th century.  The dish gained more widespread popularity in the 1970s, after the <a href="/United_States_Senate" title="United States Senate">United States Senate</a> cafeteria added it to the menu in honor of Louisiana Senator <a href="/Allen_Ellender" title="Allen Ellender">Allen Ellender</a>.  The popularity of chef <a href="/Paul_Prudhomme" title="Paul Prudhomme">Paul Prudhomme</a> in the 1980s spurred further interest in gumbo. The dish is the official cuisine of the state of Louisiana.</p>

Gumbo sauce or gravy derives from three primary thickeners: <a href="/Okra" title="Okra">okra</a>, <a href="/Fil%C3%A9_powder" title="Filé powder">filé powder</a>, and <a href="/Roux" title="Roux">roux</a>.&#60;ref name=gutierrez56/&#62;  Traditionally, okra and filé powder are not used in the same dish, although this rule is sometimes broken.&#60;ref name=nobles107&#62;Nobles (2009), p. 107.&#60;/ref&#62;  Roux can be used alone or in conjunction with either of the other thickeners.&#60;ref name=nobles111&#62;Nobles (2009), p. 111.&#60;/ref&#62;&#60;ref name=gutierrez55and56&#62;Gutierrez (1992), pp. 55&#38;ndash;56.&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>Okra is more often used as a thickener in seafood gumbos than those with meat.&#60;ref name=gutierrez56&#62;Gutierrez (1992), p. 56.&#60;/ref&#62;  This <a href="/Mucilage" title="Mucilage">mucilaginous</a> vegetable is usually cooked first, and other ingredients added once the desired consistency is reached.&#60;ref name=gutierrez57/&#62; According to <i>The Oxford Companion to Food</i>, okra-based gumbos are becoming less popular, as changing tastes have made the okra texture less palatable.&#60;ref name=davidson126/&#62;</p>
<p>Ground sassafras leaf, known as filé, is generally not added to the gravy until after the vegetables and meats or seafood have finished cooking and have been removed from the heat source.  If added during the boiling process, filé makes the gumbo too <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ropy">ropey</a>;&#60;ref name=gutierrez57/&#62; when added at the end, the gumbo gains a slightly stringy texture.&#60;ref name=davidson126/&#62;  </p>
<p>Roux has become the most popular thickener,&#60;ref name=davidson126&#62;Davidson and Jain (2006), p. 126.&#60;/ref&#62; made from cooking together a roughly equal proportion of flour and fat (traditionally hog lard, although increasingly made with butter since the mid-20th century&#60;ref name=nobles113&#62;Nobles (2009), p. 113.&#60;/ref&#62;). The length of cooking time determines the final flavor and texture, since the longer the roux is cooked before being added to the gumbo, the darker it becomes and the less thickening power it retains.  A very dark roux provides a much thinner sauce with a more intense flavor than a light roux.&#60;ref name=nobles113&#62;Nobles (2009), p. 113.&#60;/ref&#62;</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Origin">Origin</span></h3>
<p>Scholars agree that gumbo originated in Louisiana in the early 18th century,&#60;ref name=nobles98/&#62; but its uncertain etymology makes it difficult to pinpoint the origins of the food.&#60;ref name=usner46&#62;Usner (2000), p. 46.&#60;/ref&#62;  Although no conclusive evidence exists, cultural markers indicate several plausible scenarios.&#60;ref name=bienvenue134&#62;Bienvenue <i>et al</i>. (2005), p. 134.&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>According to one suggestion, gumbo is a reinterpretation of traditional African cooking.  West Africans used the vegetable okra as a base for many dishes, including soups, often pairing okra with meat and shrimp, with salt and pepper as seasonings. In Louisiana, the dish was modified to include ingredients introduced by other cultural groups.&#60;ref name=bienvenue134/&#62; Surviving records indicate that by 1764 African slaves in New Orleans mixed cooked okra with rice to make a meal.&#60;ref name=nobles100&#62;Nobles (2009), p. 100.&#60;/ref&#62; </p>
<p>Gumbo could instead be a derivation of traditional French soups, particularly the fish stew <a href="/Bouillabaisse" title="Bouillabaisse">bouillabaisse</a>.&#60;ref name=gutierrez54/&#62;&#60;ref name=nobles99/&#62;  During the cold winters, Acadians generally cooked soups,&#60;ref name=brasseaux134/&#62; using whatever ingredients were readily available.&#60;ref name=nobles103/&#62; When the Acadians moved to Louisiana in the mid-18th century, they were unable to find many of their traditional ingredients, including turnips and cabbage.&#60;ref name=&#34;brasseaux134&#34;/&#62;   In this scenario, Acadian colonists substituted local ingredients for those commonly included in the original stew.  Instead of the  fish, settlers used shellfish.  The dish was later modified to include ingredients common in other cultures.&#60;ref name=gutierrez54/&#62;  </p>
<p>Some culinary experts in the early 20th century, including <a href="/Celestine_Eustis" title="Celestine Eustis">Celestine Eustis</a>, maintained that gumbo was an early special occasion dish for native tribes.&#60;ref name=nobles99/&#62;  This is further implied by a late 18th-century Cajun practice.  At that time, rice was a luxury for many Cajuns.  They served gumbo over corn <a href="/Grits" title="Grits">grits</a>, a pairing common in the stews of native tribes.  The use of corn and filé powder may imply that the dish was derived from native cuisine.&#60;ref name=nobles100/&#62; </p>
<p>These theories are intermixed in the local legend of the Frying Pan Revolt, or Petticoat Insurrection.  According to legend, in 1722, female French colonists gathered in New Orleans at the home of Governor <a href="/Jean-Baptiste_Le_Moyne%2C_Sieur_de_Bienville" title="Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne, Sieur de Bienville">Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne, Sieur de Bienville</a>, to protest the lack of familiar ingredients. Bienville&#39;s housekeeper, Madame Langlois, taught the women how to improve the basic gumbo.  Langlois used okra, an ingredient to which the women had previously been introduced by their slaves.  Langlois introduced ingredients common in Choctaw cuisine &#38;ndash; rice, shrimp, crawfish, and filé powder.&#60;ref name=nobles99&#62;Nobles (2009), p. 99.&#60;/ref&#62;</p>

<p>The first written references to gumbo appear in the early 19th century.  In 1802, <a href="/John_Sibley" title="John Sibley">John Sibley</a> described &#34;the dish they call gumbo which is made principally of the ochre into a thick kind of soop {{sic}} &#38; eat with rice, it is the food of every body for dinner and supper.&#34;&#60;ref name=nobles104q&#62;quoted in Nobles (2009), p. 104.&#60;/ref&#62;  The following year, French governor <a href="/Pierre_Clement_de_Laussat" title="Pierre Clement de Laussat">Pierre Clement de Laussat</a> hosted a soirée in which 24 different gumbos were prepared.  According to author Cynthia Lejeune Nobles, these two events &#34;give clues to gumbo&#39;s Spanish colonial popularity and illustrate that the dish could be both humble and refined&#34;.&#60;ref name=nobles104&#62;Nobles (2009), p. 104.&#60;/ref&#62;  </p>
<p>An 1824 cookbook, <a href="/Mary_Randolph" title="Mary Randolph">Mary Randolph</a>&#39;s <i>The Virginia House-Wife</i>, was the first to include a recipe for gumbo.  Called &#34;Gumbo&#38;nbsp;– A West India Dish&#34;, the simple recipe described how to boil okra and bore little resemblance to the stew commonly known as gumbo.  The same book contained a recipe for &#34;Ochra Soup&#34; made with okra, onions, fowl, bacon, tomatoes, and lima beans thickened with flour.  Although this recipe bore similarities to gumbo, it more closely resembled the Caribbean dish <a href="/Callaloo" title="Callaloo">callaloo</a>.&#60;ref name=nobles106&#62;Nobles (2009), p. 106.&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>A more familiar version of the dish was described in an 1879 cookbook by Marion Cabell Tyree.  Her <i>Housekeeping in Old Virginia</i> described &#34;Gumbo Filit A La Creole&#34;, a filé-based gumbo with chicken and oysters and spiced with <a href="/Allspice" title="Allspice">allspice</a>, cloves, red and black pepper, parsley, and thyme.&#60;ref name=nobles106/&#62;  The 1881 cookbook <i>What Mrs. Fisher Knows About Old Southern Cooking</i>, dictated by former slave Abby Fisher, contained three gumbo recipes.  &#34;Oyster Gumbo Soup&#34; used a filé base, while &#34;Ochra Gumbo&#34; and &#34;Chicken Gumbo&#34; used okra as a base.&#60;ref name=nobles106/&#62; Four years later, the cookbook <i>La Cuisine Creole</i> documented eight varieties of gumbo.  None used sausage, but almost all of them contained ham.&#60;ref name=nobles102&#62;Nobles (2009), p. 102.&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>Until the 1970s, gumbo was primarily popular on the <a href="/Gulf_Coast_of_the_United_States" title="Gulf Coast of the United States">Gulf Coast of the United States</a>.  It gained a broader profile after the death of <a href="/United_States_Senator" title="United States Senator">United States Senator</a> <a href="/Allen_Ellender" title="Allen Ellender">Allen Ellender</a>. A native of <a href="/Terrebonne_Parish%2C_LA" title="Terrebonne Parish, LA">Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana</a>, Ellender had often cooked gumbo for his colleagues, including five American presidents.  After Ellender died in 1972, the Senate directed that their cafeteria add Louisiana Creole Gumbo, made with seafood, to its menu in his honor.  The dish became more widely popular in the 1980s, when chef <a href="/Paul_Prudhomme" title="Paul Prudhomme">Paul Prudhomme</a>&#39;s popularity spurred interest in Creole and Cajun cooking.&#60;ref name=nobles114&#62;Nobles (2009), p. 114.&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Preparation_and_serving">Preparation and serving</span></h2>
<p>Gumbo is cooked for a minimum of three hours, and often simmers all day. Meat (but not seafood) is often browned beforehand and removed from the heat. Okra and roux are cooked before other vegetables and seafood. Okra is removed from heat when it reaches the desired consistency, while roux remains in the pot.  Seasoning vegetables are then added to the sauce.  When these have turned to mush (more commonly called <i>cooked down</i>), the meat and okra are added to the pot along with water and/or <a href="/Stock_(food)" title="Stock (food)">stock</a>, then boiled uncovered until the desired tenderness of the meat is reached.&#60;ref name=gutierrez57/&#62; Seasonings, including red, black, and white pepper, <a href="/Bay_leaf" title="Bay leaf">bay leaves</a>, <a href="/Thyme" title="Thyme">thyme</a>, <a href="/Hot_sauce" title="Hot sauce">hot sauce</a>, and salt, are added to taste.&#60;ref name=broussard-marin/&#62;  According to Nobles, &#34;proper seasoning of gumbo is essential, and in Louisiana adding just the right zing is considered an art&#34;.&#60;ref name=nobles103&#62;Nobles (2009), p. 103.&#60;/ref&#62; Because seafood cooks fairly quickly, it is not added to the pot until the end of the process.  As the gumbo finishes cooking, green onions and parsley are sometimes sprinkled on it. When desired, filé powder is added last.&#60;ref name=gutierrez57/&#62;</p>
<p>Creole and Cajun gumbos are served over hot rice,&#60;ref name=&#34;bienvenue134&#34;/&#62; which helps the dish to feed a larger number of people.&#60;ref name=gutierrez56&#62;Gutierrez (1992), p. 56.&#60;/ref&#62;  Gumbo z&#39;herbes is served with rice on the side.&#60;ref name=gutierrez57/&#62; Gumbo is almost always served directly from the pot on the stove, although in wealthier or fancier homes the dish might be transferred to a <a href="/Tureen" title="Tureen">tureen</a> on the table.&#60;ref name=nobles112&#62;Nobles (2009), p. 112.&#60;/ref&#62; Often, gumbo and bread are the sole courses in a meal,&#60;ref name=gutierrez54&#62;Gutierrez (1992), p. 54.&#60;/ref&#62; although many Cajun families provide a side dish of <a href="/Potato_salad" title="Potato salad">potato salad</a>.&#60;ref name=nobles111&#62;Nobles (2009), p. 111.&#60;/ref&#62; Occasionally, gumbo is served as part of a larger menu.&#60;ref name=gutierrez54/&#62;</p>

<p>In <i>Cajun Foodways</i>, C. Paige Gutierrez describes gumbo as &#34;an economical dish&#34; useful for &#34;feed[ing] a large number of people with a small amount of meat or seafood&#34;.&#60;ref name=gutierrez56/&#62;  Nobles concurs that &#34;one of the hallmarks of gumbo is that, with a big enough pot, it can easily be doubled or tripled and is always a good choice to feed a crowd&#34;.&#60;ref name=nobles105/&#62;   With this dish, cooks can use up small portions of various ingredients that were not sufficient for an individual meal.  The dish is an efficient way to use up leftover perishable meats and seafood.&#60;ref name=gutierrez56/&#62; </p>
<p>Since the 19th century, gumbo has often been served at social gatherings or other special occasions in Louisiana.&#60;ref name=bienvenue135&#62;Bienvenue <i>et al</i>.

<p>In rural <a href="/Acadiana" title="Acadiana">Acadiana</a> in southern Louisiana, gumbo is a central feature of <a href="/Mardi_Gras" title="Mardi Gras">Mardi Gras</a> celebrations.
