<p>A <b>Sally Lunn</b> is a large bun or teacake made with a yeast dough including cream, eggs, and spice, similar to the sweet <a href="/Brioche" title="Brioche">brioche</a> breads of France. Served warm and sliced, with butter, it was first recorded in 1780 in the spa town of <a href="/Bath%2C_Somerset" title="Bath, Somerset">Bath</a> in southwest <a href="/England" title="England">England</a>. The same name has been applied to various unrelated breads in the US since the early 20th century.&#60;ref name=ODNB /&#62;</p>

<p>The origins of the Sally Lunn are shrouded in myth - one theory is that it is an anglicisation of &#34;<i>Sol et lune</i>&#34; (French for &#34;sun and moon&#34;), representing the golden crust and white base/interior.&#60;ref name=ODNB/&#62;&#60;ref name=Wood&#62;{{cite book | url= <a class="external free" href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=FBMLFM305MEC&#38;pg=PA5&#38;lpg=PA5" rel="nofollow">http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=FBMLFM305MEC&#38;pg=PA5&#38;lpg=PA5</a> | page=5 | title=Food Britannia | first=Andrew | last=Webb | publisher = Random House | year=2012 | isbn=9781409022220}}&#60;/ref&#62; The Sally Lunn Eating House claims that the recipe was brought to Bath in the 1680s by a <a href="/Huguenot" title="Huguenot">Huguenot</a> refugee called Solange Luyon, who became known as Sally Lunn,&#60;ref name=Wood /&#62; but there is no evidence to support this theory.</p>
<p>There is a passing mention of &#34;Sally Lunn and saffron cake&#34; in a 1776 poem about Dublin by the Irish poet <a href="/William_Preston_(poet)" title="William Preston (poet)">William Preston</a>.&#60;ref&#62;<a href="/William_Preston_(poet)" title="William Preston (poet)">Preston, William</a> <i>Heroic Epistle to Mr. Twiss, by Donna Teresa Pinna y Ruiz </i> in {{cite journal | url= <a class="external free" href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=_aYcfWZjTJkC&#38;pg=PA372" rel="nofollow">http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=_aYcfWZjTJkC&#38;pg=PA372</a> | page=372 | title= Verse in English from Eighteenth-century Ireland | editor=Andrew Carpenter | publisher = Cork University Press | year=1998 | isbn=9781859181034}}&#60;/ref&#62; The first recorded mention of the bun in Somerset is as part of a <a href="/Detoxification_(alternative_medicine)" title="Detoxification (alternative medicine)">detox regime</a> in <a href="/Philip_Thicknesse" title="Philip Thicknesse">Philip Thicknesse</a>&#39; 1780 guidebook to taking the waters at Bath.

<p>The medieval building now known as the Sally Lunn Eating House is at 4 North Parade Passage (formerly Lilliput Alley) in Bath {{nowrap|({{coord|51.3808|-2.3582|type:landmark_region:GB|display=inline|name=Sally Lunn Eating House}}).}} The site was originally occupied by the south range of <a href="/Bath_Abbey" title="Bath Abbey">Bath Abbey</a> and the lowest floor level dates to the reconstruction of the abbey after a great fire in 1137. The <a href="/Masonry_oven" title="Masonry oven">masonry oven</a> in the basement dates from this time. After the Reformation it came into the hands of the Colthurst family of <a href="/Wardour_Castle" title="Wardour Castle">Wardour Castle</a> who sold it to John Hall of Bradford on Avon in 1612. In 1622 Hall leased the site to George Parker, a carpenter who built the current house. The Hall estate was later acquired by the <a href="/Evelyn_Pierrepont%2C_2nd_Duke_of_Kingston-upon-Hull" title="Evelyn Pierrepont, 2nd Duke of Kingston-upon-Hull">2nd Duke of Kingston</a>, who sold the house to William Robinson in 1743. There may have been baking on a small scale during the 1700s but it only became the main commercial use of the building around the turn of the century.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external free" href="http://www.sallylunns.co.uk/history/&#60;/ref&#38;gt" rel="nofollow">http://www.sallylunns.co.uk/history/&#60;/ref&#38;gt</a>;</p>
<p>The building was acquired in the 1930s by Marie Byng-Johnson who opened it as a tea-room specializing in Sally Lunn buns, promoted with a story that she had discovered an ancient document in a secret panel above the fireplace&#60;ref name=ODNB /&#62; explaining that Mlle.
