<p>Commercial instant soups are manufactured in several types. Some consist of a packet of dry <a href="/Stock_(food)" title="Stock (food)">soup stock</a>. These do not contain water, and are prepared by adding water and then heating the product for a short time, or by adding hot water directly to the dry soup mix. Instant soup can also be produced in a dry powder form,&#60;ref name=&#34;Backpacker&#34;/&#62; such as <a href="/Unilever" title="Unilever">Unilever</a>&#39;s <a href="/Cup-a-Soup" title="Cup-a-Soup">Cup-a-Soup</a></p>
<p>Canned (tinned) instant soups contain liquid soup that is prepared by heating their contents.

<p>Freeze drying is a recent dehydration breakthrough-method that is restricted to high-value foods due to the high cost associated with the process. Despite its cost, freeze-drying is very effective in retaining the overall quality and nutritional value of the food through a process called sublimation, where water is removed (evaporated) from food in its frozen state without the transition through the liquid state. Removing water from food prevents spoilage as it does not give an environment that favors the growth of spoilage-causing microorganisms such as bacteria, mould, and yeast. Freeze-drying also reduces the total weight of the food, especially fruit and vegetables that are mostly water, thus making the transportation of these products more efficient. Vegetables used in instant soup mixes often undergo freeze-drying that helps them retain their nutritional value, texture, and flavor. Furthermore, as the food remains rigid during dehydration, subliming water creates holes where the evaporated ice crystals used to be. This allows freeze-dried foods such as vegetables to retain their shape without shrinkage, and these foods rehydrate completely when water is added to the mix that fills the voids left by the subliming water. Due to the reduced water content of the freeze-dried foods that inhibit the growth of microorganisms and prevents enzymatic chemical reactions, these foods are considered shelf-stable and can be kept safe from spoilage for years by preventing the reabsorption of moisture. Freeze-dried foods can be stored in room temperature without the need for refrigeration.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://science.howstuffworks.com/innovation/edible-innovations/freeze-drying1.htm" rel="nofollow">Freeze Drying Dehydration</a>&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
