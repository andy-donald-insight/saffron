<p>Low-alcoholic brews such as <a href="/Small_beer" title="Small beer">small beer</a> date back to at least Medieval Europe, where they served as a less risky alternative to water (which often was polluted by feces and parasites) and were less expensive than the full strength brews used at festivities.</p>
<p>In the more modern forms, the temperance movements and general regard of certain tasks like driving being unsuitable when intoxicated led to the development of beers which could be drunk without intoxicating effects.</p>
<p>In the United States, the conceptualization of non-alcohol brews took place during Prohibition, according to John Naleszkiewicz. President Wilson had proposed limiting the alcohol content in malt beverages to 2.75% in 1917 in an effort to appease avid prohibitionists.  In 1919, Congress approved the <a href="/Volstead_Act" title="Volstead Act">Volstead Act</a>, which limited the alcohol content of any beverage to 0.5%.  These beverages became known as tonics, and many breweries began brewing these extremely low alcohol content beverages in order to keep from going out of business during Prohibition.  Since removing the alcohol from the beer requires the addition of one simple step, many breweries saw this as an easy transition.  In 1933, when Prohibition was repealed, removing this single step again was easily done by many breweries.&#60;ref name=John&#62;{{cite journal |last=Naleszkiewicz |first=John |title=Low alcohol beer |journal=Brew Your Own |date=October 1995}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>At the dawn of the 21st century, alcohol-free beer has seen a rise in popularity in the Middle East (which now makes up a third of the market).&#60;ref&#62;<i>The Economist</i> explains: <a class="external text" href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2013/08/economist-explains-3" rel="nofollow">&#34;Why are sales of non-alcoholic beer booming?&#34;</a>&#60;/ref&#62; Part of the reason why it has grown in popularity is that Islamic scholars issued fatwas which permitted the consumption of beer so long as large quantities could be consumed without getting drunk.&#60;ref name=&#34;Sin-Free Ale&#34;&#62;<i>The Economist</i>: <a class="external text" href="http://www.economist.com/news/business/21582531-non-alcoholic-beer-taking-among-muslim-consumers-sin-free-ale" rel="nofollow">&#34;Sin-Free Ale&#34;</a>&#60;/ref&#62;</p>

<p>There are both up sides and down falls to converting traditional brews to non-alcoholic brews. Positive aspects of converting standard brews to non-alcoholic brews include the ability to drive after consuming several drinks, the reduction of kidney/liver damage, and less intense hangover symptoms.&#60;ref name=Anne&#62;{{cite web|last=Helmenstine|first=Anne|title=Hangover Remedies and Prevention|url=<a class="external free" href="http://chemistry.about.com/od/everydaychemistry/a/hangovers.htm" rel="nofollow">http://chemistry.about.com/od/everydaychemistry/a/hangovers.htm</a>|accessdate=2011-11-30}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>Some common complaints of non-alcoholic brews include a loss of flavor, addition of one step in the brewing process, sugary taste, and a shorter shelf life.  Along with aesthetic shortcomings of non-alcoholic brews, they also raise serious legal implications.  Local governments in some states like <a href="/Pennsylvania" title="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a> prohibit the sale of these non-alcoholic brews to persons under the age of 21.  A study conducted by the department of psychology at <a href="/Indiana_University" title="Indiana University">Indiana University</a> claimed “Because non-alcoholic beer provides sensory cues that simulate alcoholic beer, this beverage may be more effective than other placebos in contributing to a credible manipulation of expectancies to receive alcohol”,&#60;ref name=Agley&#62;{{cite journal|last=Agley|first=Jonathan|title=non-alcoholic beer|journal=Indiana Prevention Resource Center}}&#60;/ref&#62; making people feel &#34;drunk&#34; when they physically are not.</p>

<p>In Australia, regular beers have approximately 5% <a href="/ABV" title="ABV">ABV</a>; reduced-alcohol beers have 2.2%–3.2%.</p>
<p>In Canada, a reduced-alcohol beer contains 2.6%–4.0% <a href="/ABV" title="ABV">ABV</a>, and an “extra-light” beer contains less than 2.5% <a href="/ABV" title="ABV">ABV</a>.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external free" href="http://www.brewers.ca/default_e.asp?id=19&#60;/ref&#38;gt" rel="nofollow">http://www.brewers.ca/default_e.asp?id=19&#60;/ref&#38;gt</a>;</p>

<p>Low-point beer, which is often known in America as &#34;three-two beer&#34; or &#34;3 point 2 brew&#34;, is beer that contains 3.2% <a href="/Alcohol_by_volume#Alcohol_by_volume_and_alcohol_by_weight" title="Alcohol by volume">alcohol by weight</a> (equivalent to about 4% <a href="/Alcohol_by_volume" title="Alcohol by volume">ABV</a>).</p>
<p>The term &#34;low-point beer&#34; is unique to the <a href="/United_States" title="United States">United States</a>, where some states limit the sale of beer, but beers of this type are also available in countries (such as <a href="/Beer_classification_in_Sweden_and_Finland" title="Beer classification in Sweden and Finland">Sweden and Finland</a>) that tax or otherwise regulate beer according to its alcohol content. </p>
<p>In Sweden, beer containing up to 3.5% ABV (called Folköl or &#34;Peoples&#39; Beer&#34;) may be legally sold in any convenience store to people over 18 years of age, whereas stronger beer may only be sold in state-run liquor stores to people older than 20. In addition, businesses selling food for on-premises consumption do not need an alcohol license to serve 3.5% beer. Virtually all major Swedish brewers, and several international ones, in addition to their full-strength beer, make 3.5% folköl versions as well.</p>
<p>In the United States, 3.2 beer was the highest alcohol content beer allowed to be produced legally for nine months in 1933.  As part of his <a href="/New_Deal" title="New Deal">New Deal</a>, President <a href="/Franklin_D._Roosevelt" title="Franklin D. Roosevelt">Franklin D.

<p>Beers that are labeled &#34;non-alcoholic&#34; still contain a very small amount of alcohol. Thus, some US states require the purchaser to be of a legal drinking age. Exceptions include:</p>

<ul>
<li>According to <a href="/Michigan" title="Michigan">Michigan</a> law, a person must be 18 or older to purchase non-alcoholic beer.</li>
<li>In <a href="/Texas" title="Texas">Texas</a>, the law does not prohibit minors from consuming or buying non-alcoholic beer, but the law does specify that a beverage containing more than one half of one percent alcohol by volume is an alcoholic beverage and thus will follow the same restrictions as regular beer.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://alcoholpolicy.niaaa.nih.gov/Underage_Possession_Consumption_Internal_Possession_of_Alcohol.html?tab=Maps" rel="nofollow">APIS - Underage Drinking: Possession/Consumption/Internal Possession of Alcohol&#60;!-- Bot generated title --&#62;</a>&#60;/ref&#62;</li>
<li>In <a href="/Minnesota" title="Minnesota">Minnesota</a>, non alcoholic beer (under 0.5% ABV) does not fit in the category that the state defines as an alcoholic beverage and can be purchased by those under the legal drinking age.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|title=2011 Minnesota Statutes|url=<a class="external free" href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/?id=297G.01" rel="nofollow">https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/?id=297G.01</a>|publisher=Minnesota Office of the Revisor of statutes|accessdate=11 September 2012}}&#60;/ref&#62;</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Brewing_process">Brewing process</span></h2>
<p>According to the Birmingham Beverage Company, the brewing process of traditional brews consists of eight basic steps, nine for brewing non-alcoholic brews.&#60;ref name=Brewing&#62;{{cite web|title=Beer - The Brewing Process|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.alabev.com/brew.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.alabev.com/brew.htm</a>|publisher=Birmingham Brewing Company|accessdate=2011-08-11}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p> 

<ol>
<li>Malting - Barley is prepared by soaking it in water and allowing the grain to germinate or &#34;sprout&#34;.  This allows the tough starch molecules to be softened and begin conversion to sugars. Next, the sprouts are dried in a kiln; the temperature at which the sprouts are dried will affect the flavor of the finished brew.</li>
<li>Milling - Next the malted grain is ground to a corn meal like consistency, which allows the sugars and remaining starches to be more easily released when mixed with water.</li>
<li>Mashing - The finely ground malted grain is mixed with water and pulverized.  By pulverizing the slurry most of the remaining starches are converted to sugars due to enzymes present in the malt and the sugars then dissolve into the water.  The mix is gradually heated to 75℃(162℉) in what is called a mash tun.  The slurry is then filtered to remove the majority of particulates. This filtered sugary liquid is called Wort.</li>
<li>Brewing- The wort is brought to a boil for roughly 1–2 hours.  During this time, other grains that will contribute flavor, color, and aroma to the brew are added.  Boiling allows for several chemical reactions to occur and reduces the water content in the wort, condensing it.</li>
<li>Cooling- The <a href="/Wort" title="Wort">wort</a> is filtered to remove the majority of the grains and hops and then immediately cooled to allow the yeast to survive and grow in the next step.</li>
<li>Fermenting- The cooled wort is saturated with air and yeast is added within the fermentation tank.  Different strains of yeast will create different styles of beer.  This step takes around ten days.</li>
<li>Maturation — The freshly fermented un-carbonated beer is placed into a conditioning tank and, in a similar process to wine making, is allowed to age. If this step is rushed the beer will have an off flavor (<a href="/Acetaldehyde" title="Acetaldehyde">acetaldehyde</a>) that beer experts sometimes refer to as &#34;green beer&#34; because of its resemblance to green apples.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.byo.com/stories/techniques/article/indices/8-aging/151-asking-the-age-old-question" rel="nofollow">Scmidhausler, Gretchen.

(1999) How to Brew</a>&#60;/ref&#62; During this process of aging, the majority of the residual particulates will settle to the bottom of the tank.
<ol>
<li>Between the seventh and eighth step, the brew can be converted to non-alcoholic beer.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Finishing — Finally, the brewer is ready to finish the beer. The beer is filtered one last time; it is then carbonated and moved into a storage tank for either bottling or kegging.</li>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="How_low-alcohol_beer_is_made">How low-alcohol beer is made</span></h3>
<p>Low-alcohol beer starts out as regular alcoholic beer, which is then cooked in order to evaporate the alcohol. This is possible because alcohol is more volatile than water, so it is easier to boil off. The alcohol is allowed to escape and the remaining liquid is used, essentially the opposite of <a href="/Distillation" title="Distillation">distillation</a>. Most modern breweries also utilize vacuum evaporation to preserve flavor. In essence, the beer is placed under a light vacuum to facilitate the alcohol molecules going into the gaseous phase. If a sufficient vacuum is applied, it may not even be necessary to &#34;cook&#34; the beer, but heat must nevertheless be supplied.</p>
<p>An alternative process called <a href="/Reverse_osmosis" title="Reverse osmosis">reverse osmosis</a> does not require heating. The beer is passed through a filter with pores small enough that only alcohol and water (and a few volatile acids) can pass through. The alcohol is distilled out of the alcohol-water mix using conventional distillation methods. After adding the water and remaining acids back into the syrupy mixture of sugars and flavor compounds left on the other side of the filter, the process is then complete.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.chow.com/food-news/53912/how-are-nonalcoholic-beer-and-wine-made" rel="nofollow">How Are Nonalcoholic Beer and Wine Made? - Nagging Question - Food News - CHOW&#60;!-- Bot generated title --&#62;</a>&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>Sometimes beer is simply diluted with water to give the desired alcohol level.&#60;ref name=&#34;beer-advocate-criticism&#34;/&#62;
</p><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="How_non-alcoholic_beer_is_made">How non-alcoholic beer is made</span></h3>
<p>The conversion from a traditional alcoholic beer to a non-alcoholic beer takes place after the seventh step and preceding the finishing step. The un-carbonated beer is heated up to its boiling point. Another method of removing the alcohol is to decrease the pressure so the alcohol boils at room temperature.  This is the preferred method because raising the temperature this late in the brewing process can greatly affect the flavor of the brew.  If brewers decide to convert their brew to a non-alcoholic brew they must consider the volume of liquid they have lost during the removal of the alcohol. Typically the volume is reduced by roughly 4%,{{cn|post-text=Without reflux probably more would be lost|date=May 2015}} and to compensate water is added. Another tip would be avoiding using sugar from maize; this simply increases the alcohol content without adding to the flavor or body of the beer.&#60;ref name=John /&#62;  Once the alcohol is removed, one proceeds with the normal finishing process in which the beer is carbonated and bottled.</p>
