According to the writings of <a href="/Marco_Polo" title="Marco Polo">Marco Polo</a>, in the 13th century the <a href="/Tatars" title="Tatars">Tatars</a> were able to condense milk. Marco Polo reported that ten pounds (4.5&#38;nbsp;kg) of milk paste was carried by each man, who would subsequently mix the product with water. However, this probably refers to the soft Tatar curd (<a href="/Katyk" title="Katyk">katyk</a>), which can be made into a drink (<i><a href="/Ayran" title="Ayran">ayran</a></i>) by diluting it, and therefore refers to fermented, not fresh, milk concentrate.</p>

<p>Raw milk is clarified and standardised, and is then heated to {{convert|85|‚Äì|90|C}} for several seconds. This heating process destroys some microorganisms, decreases fat separation and inhibits oxidation. Some water is evaporated from the milk and sugar is added until a 9:11 (Nearly half) ratio of sugar to (evaporated) milk is reached. The sugar extends the shelf life of sweetened condensed milk. Sucrose increases the liquid&#39;s <a href="/Osmotic_pressure" title="Osmotic pressure">osmotic pressure</a>, which prevents microorganism growth.

<p>In parts of Asia and Europe, sweetened condensed milk is the preferred milk to be added to coffee or tea. Many countries in Southeast Asia, such as Vietnam, use condensed milk to flavour their coffee. In Malaysia, <i><a href="/Teh_tarik" title="Teh tarik">teh tarik</a></i> is made from tea mixed with condensed milk, and condensed milk is an integral element in <a href="/Hong_Kong_tea_culture" title="Hong Kong tea culture">Hong Kong tea culture</a>.

In <a href="/West_Yorkshire" title="West Yorkshire">West Yorkshire</a>, in the years after World War II, condensed milk was an alternative to <a href="/Jam" title="Jam">jam</a>. Nestl√© has even produced a squeeze bottle similar to Smucker&#39;s jam squeeze bottles for this very purpose. Condensed milk is a major ingredient in many Indian desserts and sweets. While most Indians start with normal milk to reduce and sweeten it, packaged condensed milk has also become popular.</p>
<p>In <a href="/New_Orleans" title="New Orleans">New Orleans</a>, sweetened condensed milk is commonly used as a topping on chocolate or similarly cream-flavored <a href="/Snowball_(dessert)" title="Snowball (dessert)">snowballs</a>. In <a href="/Scotland" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>, it is mixed with sugar and butter then boiled to form a popular sweet candy called <a href="/Tablet_(confectionery)" title="Tablet (confectionery)">Tablet</a> or Swiss-Milk-tablet, this recipe being very similar to another version of the Brazilian candy <a href="/Brigadeiro" title="Brigadeiro">brigadeiro</a> called <i>branquinho</i>. In some parts of the <a href="/Southern_U.S." title="Southern U.S.">Southern United States</a>, condensed milk is a key ingredient in <a href="/Lemon_ice_box_pie" title="Lemon ice box pie">lemon ice box pie</a>, a sort of <a href="/Cream_pie" title="Cream pie">cream pie</a>.

It is also used to make homemade <i><a href="/Dulce_de_leche" title="Dulce de leche">dulce de leche</a></i> by baking it in an oven. In Brazil, this is done by baking the unopened can in a <i><a href="/Bain-marie" title="Bain-marie">bain-marie</a></i>, the result being <i><a href="/Doce_de_leite" title="Doce de leite">doce de leite</a></i>. In Britain and Ireland, the contents of a boiled can is used as the layer between biscuit base and the banana and cream level in <a href="/Banoffee" title="Banoffee">banoffee</a>. In Latin American and Central American countries, condensed milk (along with evaporated milk and whole milk or canned cream) is used as a key ingredient in the popular <a href="/Tres_leches_cake" title="Tres leches cake">tres leches cake</a> dessert.</p>
<p>In <a href="/Jamaica" title="Jamaica">Jamaica</a>, 1 measure of condensed milk is mixed with 2 1/2 measures of bottled stout to make Guinness Punch. This is often flavoured with nutmeg and cocoa.</p>
<p>During the communism era in <a href="/Poland" title="Poland">Poland</a>, it was common to boil a can of condensed milk in water for about three hours. The resulting product - a sweet semi-liquid substance which can be used as a cake icing or put between dry wafers - essentially the same as <i>dulce de leche</i>, is called <i>kajmak</i> (although the original <a href="/Kaymak" title="Kaymak">kaymak</a> is a product similar to <a href="/Clotted_cream" title="Clotted cream">clotted cream</a>). Homemade kajmak is less common nowadays, but recently some manufacturers of condensed milk introduced canned, ready-made <i>kajmak</i> which now is widely commercially produced, and is a national favourite for the sweets fillings.
