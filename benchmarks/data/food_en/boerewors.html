<p><b>Boerewors</b> ({{IPA-nl|ˈbuːrəvors|}}) is a type of <a href="/Sausage" title="Sausage">sausage</a> popular in <a href="/South_African_cuisine" title="South African cuisine">South African cuisine</a>. The name is derived from the <a href="/Afrikaans_language" title="Afrikaans language">Afrikaans</a> words {{lang|af|<i>boer</i>}} (&#34;farmer&#34;) and {{lang|af|<i>wors</i>}} (&#34;sausage&#34;). Boerewors must contain at least 90 percent meat - always containing beef, as well as lamb or pork or a mixture of lamb and pork. The other 10% is made up of spices and other ingredients. Not more than 30% of the meat content may be fat. Boerewors may not contain any “mechanically recovered” meat (meat derived through a process where meat and bone are mechanically separated).</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>
<p>Boerewors is based on an older traditional Dutch sausage called the <i><a href="/Braadworst" title="Braadworst">verse worst</a></i>, though it differs somewhat in its ingredients.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} It is made from coarsely <a href="/Mincing" title="Mincing">minced</a> <a href="/Beef" title="Beef">beef</a> (sometimes combined with minced <a href="/Pork" title="Pork">pork</a>, <a href="/Lamb_and_mutton" title="Lamb and mutton">lamb</a>, or both) and <a href="/Spice" title="Spice">spices</a> (usually toasted <a href="/Coriander" title="Coriander">coriander seed</a>, <a href="/Black_pepper" title="Black pepper">black pepper</a>, <a href="/Nutmeg" title="Nutmeg">nutmeg</a>, <a href="/Cloves" title="Cloves">cloves</a> and <a href="/Allspice" title="Allspice">allspice</a>). Like many other forms of sausage, boerewors contains a high proportion of fat, and is <a href="/Food_preservation" title="Food preservation">preserved</a> with <a href="/Salt" title="Salt">salt</a> and <a href="/Vinegar" title="Vinegar">vinegar</a>, and packed in <a href="/Casing_(sausage)" title="Casing (sausage)">sausage casings</a>. Traditional boerewors is usually formed into a continuous spiral. It is often served with <a href="/Pap_(food)" title="Pap (food)">pap</a> (traditional South African porridge / <a href="/Polenta" title="Polenta">polenta</a> made from <a href="/Mielie-meal" title="Mielie-meal">mielie-meal</a>). Boerewors is also very common throughout <a href="/South_Africa" title="South Africa">South Africa</a>, <a href="/Namibia" title="Namibia">Namibia</a>, <a href="/Botswana" title="Botswana">Botswana</a>, <a href="/Mozambique" title="Mozambique">Mozambique</a> and <a href="/Zimbabwe" title="Zimbabwe">Zimbabwe</a> as well as with <a href="/Expatriate" title="Expatriate">expatriate</a> communities in <a href="/Australia" title="Australia">Australia</a>, <a href="/Canada" title="Canada">Canada</a>, <a href="/Republic_of_Ireland" title="Republic of Ireland">Ireland</a>, the <a href="/Netherlands" title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>, <a href="/Taiwan" title="Taiwan">Taiwan</a>, the <a href="/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, and the <a href="/United_States" title="United States">United States</a>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Preparation">Preparation</span></h2>
<p>Boerewors is usually <i><a href="/Braai" title="Braai">braaied</a></i> (grilled outdoors), but may be grilled in an electric griller. Alternatively it can also be baked in an oven, or fried in a pan. In the latter case, no additional fat (such as butter or oil) is required. Simply pricking the sausage with a fork several times will produce a sufficient quantity of its own fat to fry in.</p>
<p>A local variant of the hotdog is the boerewors, or &#34;boerie&#34;, roll which is a piece of boerewors in a <a href="/Hotdog" title="Hotdog">hotdog</a> bun, often served with a tomato, chili and onion <a href="/Relish" title="Relish">relish</a>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Variations">Variations</span></h2>
<p>The many varieties of boerewors include specialties such as garlic wors, <i>kameeldoring</i> (camel thorn), <i>Karoowors</i> (sausage from the <a href="/Karoo" title="Karoo">Karoo</a> region in South Africa), and <i>spekwors</i> (made with extra cubed pork fat). Other ingredients include cheese and chilli peppers.</p>
<p>A similar sausage may also be made from the meat of different animal species, such as <a href="/Kudu" title="Kudu">kudu</a>, and <a href="/Springbok" title="Springbok">springbok</a>, but it may not be sold as boerewors. Instead, it is named after the predominant meat species, but only if it contains at least 75% meat from that specific species.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite news|title=Regulations - Governing the Composition and Labelling of Raw Boerewors|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.capetown.gov.za/en/CityHealth/Documents/Legislation/Regulations%20-%20Governing%20the%20Composition%20and%20Labelling%20of%20Raw%20Boerewors%20-%20R%202718%20of%201990.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.capetown.gov.za/en/CityHealth/Documents/Legislation/Regulations%20-%20Governing%20the%20Composition%20and%20Labelling%20of%20Raw%20Boerewors%20-%20R%202718%20of%201990.pdf</a>|accessdate=9 August 2012}}&#60;/ref&#62; When a sausage is made from different types of game, it is called &#34;game sausage&#34;.</p>
<p>Boerewors does not keep well unrefrigerated. A similar dried or <a href="/Curing_(food_preservation)" title="Curing (food preservation)">cured</a> sausage called <a href="/Dro%C3%ABwors" title="Droëwors">droëwors</a> is prepared instead in a process similar to the preparation of <a href="/Biltong" title="Biltong">biltong</a>.
