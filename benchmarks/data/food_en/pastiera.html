The modern <i>pastiera</i> was probably invented in a Neapolitan convent. An unknown nun wanted that cake, symbol of the <a href="/Resurrection" title="Resurrection">Resurrection</a>, to have the perfume of the flowers of the orange trees which grew in the convent’s gardens. She mixed a handful of wheat to the white ricotta cheese, then she added some eggs, symbol of the new life, some water which had the fragrance of the flowers of the spring time, candied <a href="/Citron" title="Citron">citron</a> and aromatic Asian spices.</p>
<p>We know for certain that the nuns of the ancient convent of <a href="/San_Gregorio_Armeno" title="San Gregorio Armeno">San Gregorio Armeno</a> were considered to be geniuses in the complex preparation of the Pastiera. They used to prepare a great quantity for the rich families during Easter time.</p>
<p>There are three different ways of preparing pastiera: in the older, the ricotta is mixed with the eggs or with the rice in the newer, thick <a href="/Pastry_cream" title="Pastry cream">pastry cream</a> is added, making the <i>pastiera</i> softer. This innovation was introduced by Starace, a Neapolitan confectioner with a shop in a corner in Municipio Square.</p>
<p>The Pastiera has to be cooked some days in advance, no later than <a href="/Thursday" title="Thursday">Thursday</a> or <a href="/Good_Friday" title="Good Friday">Good Friday</a>, in order to allow the fragrances to mix properly and result in that unique flavor. The Pastiera is not only cooked but also sold and served in appropriate pans called &#34;ruoti&#34; because it is very fragile, so it would easily crumble up if removed from the &#34;ruoto&#34;.</p>
