<p>In the time of <a href="/Elizabeth_I_of_England" title="Elizabeth I of England">Elizabeth I of England</a> (1592), the London Clerk of Markets issued a decree forbidding the sale of hot cross buns and other spiced breads, except at burials, on Good Friday, or at Christmas.

<p>In the Bremen area in northern Germany a &#34;Hedwig&#34; (lower Saxon: <i>heet week</i>) was an ancient Shrove Tuesday meal. On Shrove Tuesday the top of a Hedwig was cut off and the Hedwig was filled with a tablespoon of hot butter and cinnamon-powder. The top was put back again and the Hedwig was served in a soup plate filled with hot milk or cream. At last a tablespoon of cinnamon-sugar mulled over the Hedwig, then eaten with a tablespoon. Today a Hedwig is the sweet part of a Sunday breakfast in northern Germany.</p>
<p>In Friesland, the northern part of the Netherlands there are &#34;Hite wigge&#34;. The are very close to the original Hot Cross Bun and Bremen&#39;s Hedwig.</p>
