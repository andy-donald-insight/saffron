<b>Buttermilk</b> refers to a number of dairy drinks. Originally, buttermilk was the liquid left behind after churning <a href="/Butter" title="Butter">butter</a> out of <a href="/Cream" title="Cream">cream</a>. This type of buttermilk is known as <i>traditional buttermilk.</i></p>
<p>The term <i>buttermilk</i> also refers to a range of fermented milk drinks, common in warm climates (e.g., the Balkans, the Middle East, Turkey, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Nepal, India, Sri Lanka, Nicaragua and the Southern United States) where <a href="/Soured_milk" title="Soured milk">unrefrigerated fresh milk sours quickly</a>,&#60;ref name=ny1&#62;{{cite news |title=Got Buttermilk? |url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/26/magazine/26food-t-000.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/26/magazine/26food-t-000.html</a> |first=Christine |last=Muhlke |newspaper=New York Times |date=April 22, 2009 }}&#60;/ref&#62; as well as in colder climates, such as Scandinavia, Ireland, Netherlands, Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia, Croatia and the Czech Republic. This <a href="/Fermented_dairy_product" title="Fermented dairy product">fermented dairy product</a> known as <i>cultured buttermilk</i> is produced from <a href="/Cow&#39;s_milk" title="Cow&#39;s milk">cow&#39;s milk</a> and has a characteristically sour taste caused by <a href="/Lactic_acid_bacteria" title="Lactic acid bacteria">lactic acid bacteria</a>.

<p>The tartness of buttermilk is due to acid in the milk. The increased <a href="/Acidity" title="Acidity">acidity</a> is primarily due to <a href="/Lactic_acid" title="Lactic acid">lactic acid</a> produced by lactic acid bacteria while <a href="/Fermentation_(biochemistry)" title="Fermentation (biochemistry)">fermenting</a> <a href="/Lactose" title="Lactose">lactose</a>, the primary sugar in milk.

<p>Originally, buttermilk referred to the liquid left over from <a href="/Churning_(butter)" title="Churning (butter)">churning</a> <a href="/Butter" title="Butter">butter</a> from cultured or fermented <a href="/Cream" title="Cream">cream</a>. Traditionally, before cream could be skimmed from whole milk, the milk was left to sit for a period of time to allow the cream and milk to separate. During this time, naturally occurring lactic acid-producing bacteria in the milk fermented it. This facilitates the butter churning process, since fat from cream with a lower pH coalesces more readily than that of fresh cream. The acidic environment also helps prevent potentially harmful microorganisms from growing, increasing shelf-life.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|last= Douma (Ed.) |first= Michael |title= Ripening to Ferment Milk Sugars to Lactic Acid |publisher= Webexhibits |date= 2007-06-14 |url= <a class="external free" href="http://www.webexhibits.org/butter/culturing.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.webexhibits.org/butter/culturing.html</a> |accessdate= 2008-12-31 }}&#60;/ref&#62; However, in establishments that used cream separators, the cream was hardly acidic at all.</p>
<p>On the Indian subcontinent, the term &#34;buttermilk&#34; refers to the liquid left over after extracting butter from churned cream. Today, this is called <i>traditional buttermilk</i>. Traditional buttermilk is still common in many Nepalese, Indian and Pakistani households but rarely found in western countries.&#60;ref name=&#34;Fankhause&#34; /&#62;
