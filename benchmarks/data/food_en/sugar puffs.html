<p>The cereal is known for its Honey Monster mascot, a large, hairy, yellow creature introduced in 1976.

<p>Honey Monster Puffs are made from wheat, which is puffed using steam.  The wheat puffs are then glazed with <a href="/High-fructose_corn_syrup" title="High-fructose corn syrup">glucose-fructose syrup</a> and sugar.  Despite the emphasis on honey in advertising and branding, and a 20% increase in honey content in early 2015 the product is still only 3.6% honey.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.honeymonster.co.uk/more-honey" rel="nofollow">http://www.honeymonster.co.uk/more-honey</a>|title=Honey Monster Puffs|work=honeymonster.co.uk}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>

<p>Sugar Puffs posters can clearly be seen in the 1966 film <i><a href="/Daleks_-_Invasion_Earth_2150_AD" title="Daleks - Invasion Earth 2150 AD">Daleks - Invasion Earth 2150 AD</a></i>. They helped to finance the film, and in return held a giveaway contest in which the grand prize was a <a href="/Dalek" title="Dalek">Dalek</a> prop made for the film.</p>
<p>The cereals&#39; mascot is the Honey Monster, a large, hairy, yellow humanoid creature who was first seen on TV in 1976 in an <a href="/Advertisement" title="Advertisement">advertisement</a> created by John Webster of the advertising agency <a href="/Boase_Massimi_Pollitt" title="Boase Massimi Pollitt">BMP</a>.&#60;ref name=&#34;footnote 1&#34;&#62;Mark Tungate, <i>Adland: A Global History of Advertising</i>, <a href="/Kogan_Page_Publishers" title="Kogan Page Publishers">Kogan Page Publishers</a>, London, 2007, p.92.&#60;/ref&#62; The advert focused around a nutritional message which was illustrated by the parent and child relationship of <a href="/Henry_McGee" title="Henry McGee">Henry McGee</a> and the Honey Monster.The monster shouts &#34;Tell them about the honey, mummy!&#34; to which Henry McGee responds &#34;I&#39;m not his mummy!&#34;. The monster then proceeds to destroy the set.</p>
<p>In the late 1980s, &#34;Sugar Puffs&#34; advertisements featured the slogan &#34;You&#39;ll Go Monster-Mad For The Honey&#34;. These advertisements portrayed children trying to get access to a packet of Sugar Puffs with someone or something then preventing them from getting the Sugar Puffs. The children would then cry &#34;I Want My Honey!!&#34; and they would then turn into Sugar Puffs Honey Monsters and thus get the Sugar Puffs.</p>
<p>There were a number of settings for these advertisements. The advertisements themselves were:
</p>
<ul>
<li>&#34;Breakfast time&#34;: Where a boy tries to reach a packet of Sugar Puffs on a fairly high cupboard.</li>
<li>&#34;School History Class&#34;:Where a class of children turned into the Honey Monster after seeing a Sugar Puffs delivery lorry pull up outside their classroom.</li>
<li>&#34;Boyscouts&#34;: Where three boyscouts turned into the Honey Monster after their tent zipper failed to undo properly.</li>
<li>&#34;Fairground&#34;: Where a girl tried to win a packet of Sugar Puffs at a hoop-throwing stall.</li>
<li>&#34;School Tour&#34;. A futuristic advertisement which shows boys and girls transforming into the Honey Monster after they get shown around a lavish Sugar Puffs factory.</li>
<li>&#34;Desert Island&#34;. A boy is sat at home wanting his &#34;honey&#34;, because he cannot get milk out of the milk glass. He then gets shot out of space and back into the Earth on a Caribbean setting, as the monster. He now has milk.</li>
</ul>

<p>After these advertisements, the Sugar Puffs Honey Monster was then seen in advertisements in which he was depicted playing soccer and also as a James Bond-style hero. Punk poet, <a href="/John_Cooper_Clarke" title="John Cooper Clarke">John Cooper Clarke</a>, also featured in a series of off the wall adverts in the 1990s. An advertisement showing the Honey Monster onstage with <a href="/Boyzone" title="Boyzone">Boyzone</a> at <a href="/Wembley_Arena" title="Wembley Arena">Wembley Arena</a> aired in 1996, and was voted #17 in ITV&#39;s Best TV Ads Ever 2 list{{cn|date=February 2015}} in 2006, sharing the position with the original 1976 advert. Another of the 1996 adverts showed him winning a football match. In 1998, an advert which depicted him as <a href="/Puff_Daddy" title="Puff Daddy">&#34;Puff&#34; Daddy</a> aired. In 1999, an advert called &#34;Monster Men vs Breakin&#39; Boyz&#34; aired. A modern style remake of the original 1976 advert aired in 2003.</p>
<p>In March 2008, a new campaign was launched with a television advertisement. The spot featured Honey Monster and his housemate sitting at their breakfast table, singing a nonsense song about Sugar Puffs, in the <a href="/Scat_singing" title="Scat singing">scat</a> style. Finishing with the <a href="/Advertising_slogan" title="Advertising slogan">strapline</a> ‘Feed the fun’, the advertisement represented the idea that Honey Monster brings out the child in everyone. The advert was criticised by <a href="/Julian_Barratt" title="Julian Barratt">Julian Barratt</a> and <a href="/Noel_Fielding" title="Noel Fielding">Noel Fielding</a> of the comedy duo <a href="/The_Mighty_Boosh" title="The Mighty Boosh">The Mighty Boosh</a>, who considered it to be a plagiarisation of the &#34;<a href="/Crimp_(song)" title="Crimp (song)">crimping</a>&#34; songs in their television series.</p>
<p>In August 2008 the Honey Monster featured in a charity video and single by the group <a href="/Samanda" title="Samanda">Samanda</a>, called &#34;Honey Love&#34;. Another new advert was broadcast for the Honey Waffles cereal variant, returning the Honey Monster to his true self along with his undying love for honey. The ad ends with the tagline (as said by the Honey Monster) &#34;Don&#39;t tell &#39;em about the honey, mummy&#34;, a reference to the Sugar Puffs endline from the 1970s.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="In_popular_culture">In popular culture</span></h2>
<p>The Honey Monster was used as part of a recurring gag in the film <i><a href="/Four_Lions" title="Four Lions">Four Lions</a></i> when one of the main characters uses an outfit of the character as a disguise in the final act.</p>
<p>As part of <a href="/Red_Nose_Day" title="Red Nose Day">Red Nose Day</a> 2009, Honey Monster appeared with many other advertising icons in a self-deprecating sketch &#39;The Greatest Minds in Advertising&#39;. As the punchline Honey Monster silences his colleagues by singing a song in falsetto (not his trademark deep voice) exhorting people not to buy advertised products but to give their money to <a href="/Comic_Relief" title="Comic Relief">Comic Relief</a> instead.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite av media|url=<a class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCfGC_dGn4M" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCfGC_dGn4M</a>|title=The Greatest Minds in Advertising Join Forces - Red Nose Day 2009|date=10 March 2009|work=YouTube}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
