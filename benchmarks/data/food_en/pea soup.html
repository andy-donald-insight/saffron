<p><b>Pea soup</b> or <b>split pea soup</b> is <a href="/Soup" title="Soup">soup</a> made typically from dried <a href="/Pea" title="Pea">peas</a>, such as the <a href="/Split_pea" title="Split pea">split pea</a>. It is, with variations, a part of the cuisine of many cultures. It is greyish-green or yellow in color depending on the regional variety of peas used; all are cultivars of <i><a href="/Pea" title="Pea">Pisum sativum</a></i>.</p>
<p>Pea soup has been eaten since antiquity; it is mentioned in <a href="/Aristophanes" title="Aristophanes">Aristophanes</a>&#39; <i><a href="/The_Birds_(play)" title="The Birds (play)">The Birds</a></i>, and according to one source &#34;the Greeks and Romans were cultivating this legume about 500 to 400 BC.

A well-known nursery rhyme which first appeared in 1765 speaks of
</p>

<p>In 19th-century English literature, pea soup is referred to as a simple food and eating it as a sign of poverty. In a <a href="/William_Makepeace_Thackeray" title="William Makepeace Thackeray">Thackeray</a> novel, when a character asks his wife &#34;Why don&#39;t you ask some of our old friends? Old Mrs. Portman has asked us twenty times, I am sure, within the last two years,&#34; she replies, with &#34;a look of ineffable scorn,&#34; that when &#34;the last time we went there, there was pea-soup for dinner!&#34; In <a href="/Thomas_Hardy" title="Thomas Hardy">Thomas Hardy</a>&#39;s <i><a href="/Tess_of_the_D&#39;Urbervilles" title="Tess of the D&#39;Urbervilles">Tess of the D&#39;Urbervilles</a></i>, Tess remarks that &#34;we have several proofs that we are d&#39;Urbervilles... we have a very old silver spoon, round in the bowl like a little ladle, and marked with the same castle.

<p><i>Soupe aux pois (jaunes)</i> (yellow pea soup) is a traditional dish in Canadian cuisine. This split pea soup is very popular nationwide, but originated in Québécois cuisine. One source&#60;ref&#62;Ferguson, Carol and Fraser, Margaret, A Century of Canadian Home Cooking: 1900 through the 90&#39;s, Prentice Hall Canada Inc., Scarborough, 1992&#60;/ref&#62; says &#34;The most authentic version of Quebec&#39;s soupe aux pois use whole yellow peas, with <a href="/Salt_pork" title="Salt pork">salt pork</a>, and herbs for flavour. After cooking, the pork is usually chopped and returned to the soup, or sometimes removed to slice thinly and served separately... Newfoundland Pea Soup is very similar, but usually includes more vegetables such as diced turnips and carrots, and is often topped with small dumplings called dough boys or doughballs.&#34;</p>
<p>A novel about nineteenth-century Canadian farmers by <a href="/Louis_H%C3%A9mon" title="Louis Hémon">Louis Hémon</a>, entitled <i><a href="/Maria_Chapdelaine" title="Maria Chapdelaine">Maria Chapdelaine</a></i>, depicts pea soup as common farmhouse fare:</p>

</dl>


<dl>
<dd>&#34;...Most of you farmers, know how it is too. All the morning you have worked hard, and go to your house for dinner and a little rest. Then, before you are well seated at table, a child is yelling:—&#39;The cows are over the fence;&#39; or &#39;The sheep are in the crop,&#39; and everyone jumps up and runs... And when you have managed to drive the cows or the sheep into their paddock and put up the rails, you get back to the house nicely &#39;rested&#39; to find the pea-soup cold and full of flies, the pork under the table gnawed by dogs and cats, and you eat what you can lay your hands on, watching for the next trick the wretched animals are getting ready to play on you.&#34;</dd>

Pea soup is a common dish throughout Germany. It often contains meat such as bacon, sausage or <i>Kassler</i> (cured and smoked pork) depending on regional preferences. Very often, several Würste (Wurst meaning sausage) will accompany a serving of pea soup as well as some dark bread. Ready-made soup in cans is sometimes used to prepare the dish.</p>
<p>One of the very first instant products was a pea soup product, which mainly consisted of pea meal and beef fat (&#34;<a href="/Erbswurst" title="Erbswurst">Erbswurst</a>&#34;: pea sausage). It was invented in 1867 by Johann Heinrich Grüneberg, who sold the recipe to the Prussian state. When the <a href="/Franco-Prussian_War" title="Franco-Prussian War">Franco-Prussian War</a> broke out, the war ministry, which had previously tested the possibility of feeding soldiers solely on instant pea soup and bread, built a large manufacturing plant and produced between 4,000 and 5,000 tons of Erbswurst for the army during the war. In 1889, the Knorr instant-food company bought the license. Knorr, which is today a <a href="/Unilever" title="Unilever">Unilever</a> brand, continues the production of Erbswurst to the present day.</p>

As Finland was until 1809 part of the <a href="/Swedish_Realm" title="Swedish Realm">Swedish Realm</a>, <a href="/Sweden" title="Sweden">Sweden</a> and <a href="/Finland" title="Finland">Finland</a> share many cultural traditions, including that of the pea soup (<a href="/Swedish_language" title="Swedish language">Swedish</a> <i>ärtsoppa</i>; <a href="/Finnish_language" title="Finnish language">Finnish</a> <i>hernekeitto</i> ; <a href="/Norwegian_language" title="Norwegian language">Norwegian</a> <i>ertesuppe</i>; <a href="/Danish_language" title="Danish language">Danish</a> <i>gule ærter</i>). In Sweden and Finland it is traditional to eat pea soup on Thursdays, served with <a href="/Pork" title="Pork">pork</a> and <a href="/Mustard_(condiment)" title="Mustard (condiment)">mustard</a>, and <a href="/Pancake" title="Pancake">pancakes</a> for dessert, in Sweden sometimes accompanied by <a href="/Swedish_punsch" title="Swedish punsch">Swedish punsch</a> as beverage. In Finland the soup is made of green peas, in Sweden and Denmark yellow peas are used. The tradition of eating pea soup and pancakes on Thursdays is said to originate in the pre-<a href="/Protestant_Reformation" title="Protestant Reformation">Reformation</a> era, as preparation for <a href="/Fasting" title="Fasting">fasting</a> on Friday.</p>
<p>Scandinavian pea soup is normally cooked with pork&#38;nbsp;– although the meat may sometimes be served on the side&#38;nbsp;– and a typical recipe would also include <a href="/Onion" title="Onion">onions</a> and herbs like <a href="/Thyme" title="Thyme">thyme</a> and <a href="/Marjoram" title="Marjoram">marjoram</a>. It is usually eaten with some mustard, often accompanied by <a href="/Crisp_bread" title="Crisp bread">crisp bread</a> and often with the sweet liquor <a href="/Punsch" title="Punsch">punsch</a> (served hot). Mustard is an important part of the dish, but the soup is served without it so that diners can stir it in to taste.

In Denmark, pea soup (known as <i>gule ærter</i>) is not served with pancakes and the mustard is scooped up with <a href="/Rugbr%C3%B8d" title="Rugbrød">rye bread</a> on the side. In addition, the dish is sometimes served with <i><a href="/Medisterp%C3%B8lse" title="Medisterpølse">medisterpølse</a></i>, boiled potatoes and pickled beets and often turned into a feast, with copious amounts of beer and <a href="/Snaps" title="Snaps">snaps</a> on festive occasions.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|url=<a class="external free" href="http://norddjurs.lokalavisen.dk/intet-hjorddrengenes-marked-uden-gule-aerter-/20140909/artikler/140909460" rel="nofollow">http://norddjurs.lokalavisen.dk/intet-hjorddrengenes-marked-uden-gule-aerter-/20140909/artikler/140909460</a>|title=No &#34;Hjorddrengenes&#34;-market without gule ærter|language=Danish|newspaper=Lokalavisen, Norddjurs|publisher=Politikens Lokalaviser A/S|author=Martin Schultz|date=9 September 2014|accessdate=17 October 2014}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>The tradition of Thursday pea soup is common in restaurants and households, and is an unpretentious but well-liked part of social life. Swedish Prime Minister <a href="/Per_Albin_Hansson" title="Per Albin Hansson">Per Albin Hansson</a> (1885–1946) had a circle of friends, jokingly referred to as the &#34;peralbinians&#34; (<i>peralbinerna</i>), who for a number of years came to his home every Thursday to eat pea soup, drink hot <i>punsch</i> and play <a href="/Contract_bridge" title="Contract bridge">bridge</a>.

In Finland and Sweden it is a popular school food, since it is cheap and easy to prepare. In Denmark, <i>gule ærter</i> is often reserved for specific events, traditions or at larger gatherings and it is believed that the dish has a very long history. It can be dated to 1766 in written sources, but might have originated as early as the <a href="/Nordic_Bronze_Age" title="Nordic Bronze Age">Bronze Age</a>, when dried peas and cabbage became popular vegetables for the long winters here.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|url=<a class="external free" href="http://guleaerter.dk/familien-locke-her-kan-gryden-ikke-blive-stor-nok/" rel="nofollow">http://guleaerter.dk/familien-locke-her-kan-gryden-ikke-blive-stor-nok/</a>|title=Familien Løcke|language=Danish|website=guleærter.dk|publisher=Møllerens|accessdate=17 October 2014}}&#60;/ref&#62;&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.copenhagenet.dk/CPH-Map/CPH-Recipes-10-10-Split-Pea.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.copenhagenet.dk/CPH-Map/CPH-Recipes-10-10-Split-Pea.asp</a>|title=&#34;Gule Ærter&#34; - Split-Pea Soup - A Old National and Everyday Dish|website=Danish Food Culture|publisher=Copenhagen Portal|accessdate=17 October 2014}}.
