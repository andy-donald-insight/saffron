The accidental legacy of corn flakes goes back to the late 19th century, when a team of  <a href="/Seventh-day_Adventist_Church" title="Seventh-day Adventist Church">Seventh-day Adventists</a> began to develop new food to adhere to the <a href="/Vegetarianism" title="Vegetarianism">vegetarian diet</a> recommended by the church. Members of the group experimented with a number of different grains, including wheat, oats, rice, barley, and corn. In 1894, Dr. <a href="/John_Harvey_Kellogg" title="John Harvey Kellogg">John Harvey Kellogg</a>, the superintendent of The <a href="/Battle_Creek_Sanitarium" title="Battle Creek Sanitarium">Battle Creek Sanitarium</a> in Michigan and an Adventist, used these recipes as part of a strict vegetarian regimen for his patients, which also included no alcohol, tobacco, or caffeine. The diet he imposed consisted entirely of bland foods. A follower of  <a href="/Sylvester_Graham" title="Sylvester Graham">Sylvester Graham</a>, the inventor of <a href="/Graham_cracker" title="Graham cracker">graham crackers</a> and <a href="/Graham_bread" title="Graham bread">graham bread</a>, Kellogg believed that spicy or sweet foods would increase passions.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|url= <a class="external free" href="http://www.geocities.com/Athens/oracle/9840/kellogg.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/Athens/oracle/9840/kellogg.html</a> |title=Dr. John Harvey Kellogg|archiveurl=<a class="external free" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070712032809/http://www.geocities.com/Athens/oracle/9840/kellogg.html" rel="nofollow">http://web.archive.org/web/20070712032809/http://www.geocities.com/Athens/oracle/9840/kellogg.html</a>|archivedate=July 12, 2007}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>This idea for corn flakes began by accident when Kellogg and his younger brother, <a href="/Will_Keith_Kellogg" title="Will Keith Kellogg">Will Keith Kellogg</a>, left some cooked <a href="/Wheat" title="Wheat">wheat</a> to sit while they attended to some pressing matters at the <a href="/Battle_Creek_Sanitarium" title="Battle Creek Sanitarium">sanitarium</a>. When they returned, they found that the wheat had gone stale, but being on a strict budget, so they decided to continue to process it by forcing it through rollers, hoping to obtain long sheets of the dough. To their surprise, what they found instead were flakes, which they toasted and served to their patients. This event occurred on August 8, 1894, and a patent for &#34;Flaked Cereals and Process of Preparing Same&#34; was filed on May 31, 1895, and issued on April 14, 1896.&#60;ref name=patent/&#62;&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|url= <a class="external free" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080315031409/http://www.newsoftheodd.com/content/view/214/" rel="nofollow">http://web.archive.org/web/20080315031409/http://www.newsoftheodd.com/content/view/214/</a>|title=News of the Odd, John Harvey Kellogg Serves Corn Flakes at the San (March 7, 1897)}}&#60;/ref&#62;&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|url= <a class="external free" href="http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/kellogg.html" rel="nofollow">http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/kellogg.html</a> |title=Inventor of the Week: W.K Kellogg|work=mit.edu }}&#60;/ref&#62;

<p>The flakes of grain, which the Kelloggs called <i>granose</i>, were a very popular food among the patients. The brothers then experimented with other flakes from other grains. In 1906, Will Keith Kellogg, who served as the business manager of the sanitarium, decided to try to mass-market the new food. At his new company, <a href="/Battle_Creek_Toasted_Corn_Flake_Company" title="Battle Creek Toasted Corn Flake Company">Battle Creek Toasted Corn Flake Company</a>, he added sugar to the flakes to make them more palatable to a mass audience, but this caused a rift between his brother and him. In 1907, his same company ran an ad campaign which offered a free box of cereal to any woman who winked at her grocer.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|title=Food Facts and Trivia: Corn Flakes|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.foodreference.com/html/fcornflakes.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.foodreference.com/html/fcornflakes.html</a>|website=foodreference.com|accessdate=9 September 2015}}&#60;/ref&#62;To increase sales, in 1909, he added a special offer, the <i>Funny Jungleland Moving Pictures Booklet</i>, which was made available to anyone who bought two boxes of the cereal. This same premium was offered for 22 years. At the same time, Kellogg also began experimenting with new grain cereals to expand his product line. <a href="/Rice_Krispies" title="Rice Krispies">Rice Krispies</a>, his next great hit, first went on sale in 1928.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|url= <a class="external free" href="http://www.kaplanink.com/uploads/Cereal%20City%20story%20web%20no%20pics.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.kaplanink.com/uploads/Cereal%20City%20story%20web%20no%20pics.pdf</a>|title= 100 Years of Cornflakes |work=kaplanink.com}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
