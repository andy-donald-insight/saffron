<b>Common salt</b> is a <a href="/Mineral" title="Mineral">mineral</a> composed primarily of <a href="/Sodium_chloride" title="Sodium chloride">sodium chloride</a> (NaCl), a <a href="/Chemical_compound" title="Chemical compound">chemical compound</a> belonging to the larger class of <a href="/Salt_(chemistry)" title="Salt (chemistry)">salts</a>; salt in its natural form as a <a href="/Crystallinity" title="Crystallinity">crystalline</a> mineral is known as rock salt or <a href="/Halite" title="Halite">halite</a>. Salt is present in vast quantities in <a href="/Seawater" title="Seawater">seawater</a>, where it is the main mineral constituent; the open ocean has about {{convert|35|g|oz}} of solids per litre, a <a href="/Salinity" title="Salinity">salinity</a> of 3.5%. <a href="/Sodium_in_biology" title="Sodium in biology">Salt is essential for animal life</a>, and saltiness is one of the <a href="/Basic_tastes" title="Basic tastes">basic human tastes</a>. The tissues of animals contain larger quantities of salt than do plant tissues; therefore the typical diets of nomads who subsist on their flocks and herds require little or no added salt, whereas cereal-based diets require supplementation. Salt is one of the oldest and most ubiquitous of food seasonings, and <a href="/Salting_(food)" title="Salting (food)">salting</a> is an important method of <a href="/Food_preservation" title="Food preservation">food preservation</a>.</p>
<p>Some of the earliest evidence of salt processing dates to around 8,000 years ago, when people living in <a href="/Romania" title="Romania">Romania</a> were boiling <a href="/Spring_(hydrology)" title="Spring (hydrology)">spring water</a> to extract the salts; a <a href="/Salt_in_Chinese_History#Ancient_China_and_the_early_empire" title="Salt in Chinese History">salt-works in China</a> has been found which dates to approximately the same period. Salt was prized by the ancient Hebrews, the Greeks, the Romans, the Byzantines, the Hittites and the Egyptians. Salt became an important article of trade and was transported by boat across the Mediterranean Sea, along specially built salt roads, and across the Sahara in camel caravans. The scarcity and universal need for salt has led nations to go to war over salt and use it to raise tax revenues. Salt is also used in religious ceremonies and has other cultural significance.</p>
<p>Salt is processed from <a href="/Salt_mining" title="Salt mining">salt mines</a>, or by the <a href="/Evaporation" title="Evaporation">evaporation</a> of seawater (<a href="/Sea_salt" title="Sea salt">sea salt</a>) or mineral-rich spring water in shallow pools. Its major industrial products are <a href="/Caustic_soda" title="Caustic soda">caustic soda</a> and <a href="/Chlorine" title="Chlorine">chlorine</a>, and it is used in many industrial processes and in the manufacture of <a href="/Polyvinyl_chloride" title="Polyvinyl chloride">polyvinyl chloride</a>, <a href="/Plastic" title="Plastic">plastics</a>, <a href="/Paper_pulp" title="Paper pulp">paper pulp</a> and many other products. Of the annual production of around two hundred million <a href="/Tonne" title="Tonne">tonnes</a> of salt, only about 6% is used for human consumption; other uses include water conditioning processes, de-icing highways and agricultural use. Edible salt is sold in forms such as sea salt and table salt which usually contains an <a href="/Anti-caking_agent" title="Anti-caking agent">anti-caking agent</a> and may be <a href="/Iodised_salt" title="Iodised salt">iodised</a> to prevent <a href="/Iodine_deficiency" title="Iodine deficiency">iodine deficiency</a>.

Humans have always tended to build communities either around source of salt, or where they can trade for it.</p>
<p>All through history the availability of salt has been pivotal to civilization. The word &#34;salary&#34; comes from the <a href="/Latin" title="Latin">Latin</a> word for salt because the <a href="/Roman_Legion" title="Roman Legion">Roman Legions</a> were sometimes paid in salt, which was quite literally worth its weight in <a href="/Gold" title="Gold">gold</a>. In Britain, the suffix &#34;<a href="/-wich" title="-wich">-wich</a>&#34; in a placename means it was once a source of salt, as in <a href="/Sandwich%2C_England" title="Sandwich, England">Sandwich</a> and <a href="/Norwich%2C_England" title="Norwich, England">Norwich</a>. The <a href="/Natron_Valley" title="Natron Valley">Natron Valley</a> was a key region that supported the <a href="/Egyptian_Empire" title="Egyptian Empire">Egyptian Empire</a> to its north, because it supplied it with a kind of salt that came to be called by its name, <a href="/Natron" title="Natron">natron</a>.</p>
<p>Even before this, what is now thought to have been the first city in Europe is <a href="/Solnitsata" title="Solnitsata">Solnitsata</a>, in <a href="/Bulgaria" title="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a>, which was a salt mine, providing the area now known as the <a href="/Balkans" title="Balkans">Balkans</a> with salt since 5400 BC.&#60;ref&#62;LA Times&#60;br&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://articles.latimes.com/2012/nov/01/science/la-sci-sn-oldest-european-town-20121101" rel="nofollow">Bulgarians find oldest European town, a salt production center</a>&#60;/ref&#62; Even the name Solnisata means &#34;salt works&#34;.</p>

These are either <a href="/Salt_mine" title="Salt mine">mined</a> directly, producing rock salt, or are extracted in solution by pumping water into the deposit. In either case, the salt may be purified by mechanical evaporation of brine.
