<p>A review about the cognitive advantages of chewing gum by Onyper et al. (2011) found strong evidence of improvement for the following cognitive domains: Working memory, episodic memory and perceptual speed of processing. However the improvements were only evident when chewing took place prior to cognitive testing. The precise mechanism by which gum chewing improves cognitive functioning is however not well understood.
The researchers did also note that chewing-induced arousal could be masked by the distracting nature of chewing itself, which they named &#34;dual-process theory&#34;, which in turn could explain some of the contradictory findings by previous studies. They also noticed the similarity between mild physical exercise such as pedaling a stationary bike and chewing gum. It has been demonstrated that mild physical exercise leads to little cognitive impairment during the physical task accompanied by enhanced cognitive functioning afterwards. Furthermore, the researchers noted that no improvement could be found for verbal fluency, which is in accordance with previous studies. This finding suggests that the effect of chewing gum is domain specific. The cognitive improvements after a period of chewing gum have been demonstrated to last for 15–20 minutes and decline afterwards.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.appet.2011.05.313 |pmid=21645566 |title=Cognitive advantages of chewing gum.

Chewing gum is not water-soluble and unlike other confectionery is not fully consumed. There has been much effort at public education and investment aimed at encouraging responsible disposal. Despite this it is commonly found stuck underneath benches, tables, handrails and escalators. It is extremely difficult and expensive to remove once &#34;walked in&#34; and dried. Gum bonds strongly to asphalt and rubber shoe soles because they are all made from polymeric <a href="/Hydrocarbons" title="Hydrocarbons">hydrocarbons</a>.  It also bonds strongly with concrete paving. Removal is generally achieved by steam jet and scraper but the process is slow and labour-intensive.

<p>Most external urban areas with high pedestrian traffic show high incidence of casual chewing gum discard.  Likely as a consequence of Singapore&#39;s ban, Singapore&#39;s pavements are, perhaps uniquely amongst modern cities, free of gum. More than other litter which can be picked up or is quickly degraded by the weather, chewing gum, with its glue-like characteristics, is regarded as environmentally damaging.  In 2000 a study on <a href="/Oxford_Street" title="Oxford Street">Oxford Street</a>, one of London’s busiest shopping streets, showed that a quarter of a million black or white blobs of chewing gum were stuck to its pavement.&#60;ref name=&#34;Emsley, J. 2004 pp. 189–197&#34;/&#62;</p>
