<p>In traditional classifications of barley, these morphological differences have led to different forms of barley being classified as different species. Under these classifications, two-rowed barley with shattering spikes (wild barley) is classified as <i>Hordeum spontaneum</i> <a href="/Karl_Koch_(botanist)" title="Karl Koch (botanist)">K. Koch</a>. Two-rowed barley with nonshattering spikes is classified as <i>H. distichum</i> <a href="/L." title="L.">L.</a>, six-row barley with nonshattering spikes as <i>H. vulgare</i> L. (or <i><a href="/Hordeum_hexastichum" title="Hordeum hexastichum">H. hexastichum</a></i> L.), and six-row with shattering spikes as <i>H. agriocrithon</i> Åberg.</p>
<p>Because these differences were driven by single-gene mutations, coupled with <a href="/Cell_biology" title="Cell biology">cytological</a> and <a href="/Molecular_biology" title="Molecular biology">molecular</a> evidence, most recent classifications treat these forms as a single species, <i>H. vulgare</i> L.&#60;ref name = Zohary/&#62;</p>

<p>Barley is more tolerant of soil salinity than wheat, which might explain the increase of barley cultivation in Mesopotamia from the second millennium BCE onwards.

This drink is obtained from ground, roasted barley and it is prepared as an espresso (it can be prepared using percolators, filter machines or cafetieres). It became widely used during the  Fascist period and the war, as Italy was affected by embargo and struggled to import coffee. It was also a cheaper option for poor families (often grown and roasted at home) in the period. Afterwards, it was promoted and sold as a coffee substitute for children. Nowadays, it is experiencing a revival and it can be considered some Italians&#39; favourite alternative to coffee when, for health reasons, caffeine drinks are not recommended.</p>
