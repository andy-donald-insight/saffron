<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="The_loaf">The loaf</span></h2>
<p>Usually sold in flattened rounds, it is often served <a href="/Toast" title="Toast">toasted</a> with <a href="/Butter" title="Butter">butter</a> along with a cup of <a href="/Tea" title="Tea">tea</a> in the afternoon. The <a href="/Dough" title="Dough">dough</a> is sweeter than <a href="/Sandwich_bread" title="Sandwich bread">sandwich bread</a>, but not as rich as <a href="/Cake" title="Cake">cake</a>, and the sultanas and raisins add flavour and texture to the final product. In <a href="/Ireland" title="Ireland">Ireland</a> it is sometimes called Bairín Breac, and the term is also used as two words in its more common version.  This may be from the Irish word <i>bairín</i> - a loaf - and <i>breac</i> - speckled (due to the raisins in it), hence it means a speckled loaf (a similar etymology to the Welsh <a href="/Bara_brith" title="Bara brith">bara brith</a>).</p>
<p>Other source: Barm is the technical term for the yeast filtered out of beer in the final production stages. It was a cheaper yeast source than commercial yeast used for making breac (speckled loaf).</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Halloween_tradition">Halloween tradition</span></h2>
<p>Barmbrack is the centre of an Irish <a href="/Halloween" title="Halloween">Halloween</a> custom. The Halloween Brack traditionally contained various objects baked into the bread and was used as a sort of <a href="/Fortune-telling" title="Fortune-telling">fortune-telling</a> game.&#60;ref name=&#34;darina&#34;/&#62; In the barmbrack were: a pea, a stick, a piece of cloth, a small coin (originally a silver sixpence) and a ring. Each item, when received in the slice, was supposed to carry a meaning to the person concerned: the pea, the person would not marry that year; the stick, would have an unhappy marriage or continually be in disputes; the cloth or rag, would have bad luck or be poor; the coin, would enjoy good fortune or be rich; and the ring, would be wed within the year. Other articles added to the brack include a medallion, usually of the Virgin Mary to symbolise going into the priesthood or to the Nuns, although this tradition is not widely continued in the present day.</p>
<p>Commercially produced barmbracks for the Halloween market still include a toy ring.</p>

{{cquote| The fire was nice and bright and on one of the side-tables were four very big barmbracks. These barmbracks seemed uncut; but if you went closer you would see that they had been cut into long thick even slices and were ready to be handed round at tea.}}</p>
