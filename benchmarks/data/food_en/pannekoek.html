<p>A <b>pannenkoek</b> or <b>pannekoek</b>&#60;ref&#62;The spelling, with or without intermediate -n, is a matter of discussion. According to the 2005 <a href="/Word_list_of_the_Dutch_language" title="Word list of the Dutch language"><i>Groene Boekje</i></a>, <i>pannenkoek</i> is correct; the 2006 <a href="/White_Booklet" title="White Booklet"><i>Witte Boekje</i></a> allows both. See {{Cite web | title = <i>Pannekoek</i> of <i>pannenkoek</i>? | publisher = <a href="/Genootschap_Onze_Taal" title="Genootschap Onze Taal">Genootschap Onze Taal</a> | url = <a class="external free" href="http://www.onzetaal.nl/advies/pannekoek.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.onzetaal.nl/advies/pannekoek.php</a> | accessdate = 12 January 2011}}.&#60;/ref&#62; (plural <i>pannenkoeken</i>) or <b>Dutch Pancake</b> is a style of <a href="/Pancake" title="Pancake">pancake</a> with origins in the <a href="/Netherlands" title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a> and <a href="/Belgium" title="Belgium">Belgium</a>.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite book|last=Sharron L. McElmeel, McElmeel|first=Sharron|author2=Deborah L. McElmeel|title=Authors in the pantry: recipes, stories, and more|pages=49–50|publisher=Libraries Unlimited|year=2006|isbn=978-1-59158-321-9}}&#60;/ref&#62; Pannekoeken are usually larger (up to a foot in diameter) and much thinner than their American or <a href="/Scotch_pancake" title="Scotch pancake">Scotch pancake</a> counterparts. They may incorporate slices of <a href="/Bacon" title="Bacon">bacon</a>, <a href="/Apple" title="Apple">apples</a>, <a href="/Cheese" title="Cheese">cheese</a>, or <a href="/Raisins" title="Raisins">raisins</a>. Plain ones are often eaten with <a href="/Treacle" title="Treacle">treacle</a> (syrup made of <a href="/Sugar_beet" title="Sugar beet">sugar beets</a>), <i>appelstroop</i> (an unspiced Dutch variety of <a href="/Apple_butter" title="Apple butter">apple butter</a>) or powdered sugar and are sometimes rolled up to be eaten by hand.</p>
<p>Basic ingredients are flour (plain, self-rising or both), milk, salt, and eggs. The addition of <a href="/Buckwheat" title="Buckwheat">buckwheat</a> flour (up to 50 percent) is traditional, but much less common nowadays. Milk can be replaced with <a href="/Soy_milk" title="Soy milk">soy milk</a> without changing the end result; the other ingredients are essential. Older Dutch or Belgian people may recall the use of <a href="/Beestings" title="Beestings">beestings</a> in pannekoeken instead of milk.</p>
<p>The ingredients are beaten into a batter of a fairly liquid consistency. A ladle of batter is then pan fried in butter or oil. Once the top of the pannekoek is dry and the edges start to brown, it can be flipped over. The first one is often less than perfect. At home a stack of pannekoeken can be made in advance so everyone can eat at the same time, or people can take turns at the stove.</p>
<p>Pannekoeken can be, and often are, eaten as a main course, served warm, in winter pannekoeken are sometimes eaten after <a href="/Snert" title="Snert">snert</a> in a two course meal. Pannenkoeken are a popular choice for a child&#39;s birthday meal in the Netherlands and Belgium.
Specialised pannekoeken restaurants are common in the Netherlands and Belgium. They often offer a very wide range of toppings and ingredients, traditional and modern (e.g. cheese, oregano and salami on a pizza-pannekoek).</p>
<p>Dutch and Belgian supermarkets offer pre-cooked (microwavable) pannekoeken as well as pre-made batter and dry flour mixes. The latter only needs water added, because it contains powdered egg and powdered whey.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Regional_variations">Regional variations</span></h2>
<p>In <a href="/South_Africa" title="South Africa">South Africa</a>, <i>pannekoek</i> is typically used in singular: &#34;Kom ons eet pannekoek&#34; (Let&#39;s have pannekoek.) It is served with cinnamon and sugar; the cinnamon sugar mix is sprinkled over the pancake which is then rolled up and -unless consumed instantly- will be wrapped in wax paper to maintain warmth. The cinnamon and sugar melts into this warm and soft treat. It is often prepared as you watch at church bazaars, school fetes, and most any outdoor event which serves freshly cooked food such as barbeque (braaivleis).</p>
<p>As a former Dutch colony, <a href="/Indonesia" title="Indonesia">Indonesia</a> also inherited the dish. It is locally known as <i>Panekuk</i> and is often eaten with sweet dressings such as honey, condensed milk, <a href="/Hagelslag" title="Hagelslag">Hagelslag</a> or simply sprinkled with sugar. It is also a common practice to mix the dough with sliced banana fruits.</p>
