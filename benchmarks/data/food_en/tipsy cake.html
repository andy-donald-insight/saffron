<p>A <b>tipsy cake</b> is a sweet dessert cake, made originally of &#34;fresh <a href="/Sponge_cake" title="Sponge cake">sponge cakes</a> soaked in good <a href="/Sherry" title="Sherry">sherry</a> and good <a href="/Brandy" title="Brandy">brandy</a>.&#34;&#60;ref&#62;<i>Party-giving on Every Scale</i>, London. n.d. (1880), p. 16, as &#34;looked on as a second-class sweet&#34; when part of a <a href="/Wedding_breakfast" title="Wedding breakfast">wedding breakfast</a>, but recommended.&#60;/ref&#62; The dish as prepared in England would typically have several small cakes stacked together, with the cracks between bristling with almonds. As a variety of the English <a href="/Trifle" title="Trifle">trifle</a>, tipsy cake is  popular in the <a href="/American_South" title="American South">American South</a>, often served after dinner as a dessert or at Church socials and neighborhood gatherings.</p>
<p>The tipsy cake originated in the mid-18th century. A recipe for cake or <a href="/Biscuits" title="Biscuits">biscuits</a>, alcohol, and <a href="/Custard" title="Custard">custard</a> combined in a trifle bowl came to the <a href="/Thirteen_Colonies" title="Thirteen Colonies">American colonies</a> via the British, who settled in the coastal south. Its popularity remained with Southern planters who enjoyed sweet desserts. Tipsy cake was also humorously called Tipsy <a href="/Parson" title="Parson">Parson</a>, because it presumably lured many a Sunday-visiting preacher &#34;off the wagon&#34;. The name refers to the amount of alcohol used in the dish&#39;s preparation.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external free" href="http://whatscookingamerica.net/History/Cakes/Trifle.htm&#60;/ref&#38;gt" rel="nofollow">http://whatscookingamerica.net/History/Cakes/Trifle.htm&#60;/ref&#38;gt</a>;</p>
