Many households have their own recipe for Christmas pudding, some handed down through families for generations. Essentially the recipe brings together what traditionally were expensive or luxurious ingredients&#38;nbsp;— notably the sweet spices that are so important in developing its distinctive rich aroma, and usually made with <a href="/Suet" title="Suet">suet</a>. It is very dark in appearance&#38;nbsp;— effectively black&#38;nbsp;— as a result of the dark sugars and black <a href="/Treacle" title="Treacle">treacle</a> in most recipes, and its long cooking time. The mixture can be moistened with the juice of citrus fruits, <a href="/Brandy" title="Brandy">brandy</a> and other alcohol (some recipes call for dark <a href="/Beer" title="Beer">beers</a> such as <a href="/Mild_ale" title="Mild ale">mild</a>, <a href="/Stout" title="Stout">stout</a> or <a href="/Porter_(beer)" title="Porter (beer)">porter</a>).</p>

<p>Prior to the 19th century, the English Christmas pudding was boiled in a <a href="/Pudding_cloth" title="Pudding cloth">pudding cloth</a>, and often represented as round.&#60;ref name=plyb/&#62; The new <a href="/Victorian_era" title="Victorian era">Victorian era</a> fashion involved putting the batter into a basin and then <a href="/Steaming" title="Steaming">steaming</a> it, followed by unwrapping the pudding, placing it on a platter, and decorating the top with a sprig of <a href="/Holly" title="Holly">holly</a>.&#60;ref name=plyb/&#62;</p>
<p>Initial cooking usually involves steaming for many hours. To serve, the pudding is reheated by steaming once more, and dressed with warm brandy which is set alight.&#60;ref&#62;Darran McGrady <a class="external text" href="https://books.google.com/books?id=tk7UrDRRGUIC&#38;pg=PA180" rel="nofollow">Eating Royally: Recipes and Remembrances from a Palace Kitchen</a> p.180.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>
<p>There is a popular myth that plum pudding&#39;s association with Christmas goes back to a custom in <a href="/England_in_the_Middle_Ages" title="England in the Middle Ages">medieval England</a> that the &#34;pudding should be made on the 25th Sunday after <a href="/Trinity_Sunday" title="Trinity Sunday">Trinity</a>, that it be prepared with 13 ingredients to represent Christ and the 12 apostles, and that every family member stir it in turn from east to west to honour the <a href="/Biblical_Magi" title="Biblical Magi">Magi</a> and their supposed journey in that direction&#34;.&#60;ref name=plyb/&#62; However, recipes for plum puddings appear mainly, if not entirely, in the 17th century and later. Their possible ancestors include <a href="/English_cuisine#Pies.2C_pastries_and_savoury_puddings" title="English cuisine">savoury puddings</a> such as those in <a href="/Harleian_Collection" title="Harleian Collection">Harleian</a> MS 279, crustbrandy ades,&#60;ref&#62;{{Cite web</p>

</pre>
<p>Features of these recipes were refined in ways that could have yielded plum pudding recipes. For example, combining the stirred custard with sippets makes it into a <a href="/Fruit_fool" title="Fruit fool">fool</a>, a contemporary of early plum puddings, which is very similar to a pudding. Some early <a href="/Custard_tart" title="Custard tart">custard tarts</a>, such as the <i>crustade lumbard</i> in Harleian MS 279, are only unlike plum puddings in that they are held together by a pastry crust and not by crumbs or meal. Malaches whyte, another kind of pastry, has a filling of eggs, bread crumbs, and butter, but no plums. So a fully developed plum pudding recipe could be derived from the above list of possible ancestors by some recombination. This is not to say that there were no other ancestors, only that there need not have been any.</p>
<p>Although it took its most recent form in Victorian England, the pudding&#39;s origins can be traced back to the 1420s, to two sources. It emerged not as a confection or a dessert at all, but as a way of <a href="/Food_preservation" title="Food preservation">preserving meat</a> at the end of the season. Because of shortages of fodder, all surplus <a href="/Livestock" title="Livestock">livestock</a> were slaughtered in the autumn. The meat was then kept in a <a href="/Pastry" title="Pastry">pastry</a> case along with dried fruits acting as a preservative. The resultant large &#34;<a href="/Mince_pie" title="Mince pie">mince pies</a>&#34; could then be used to feed hosts of people, particularly at the festive season. The chief ancestor of the modern pudding, however, was the <a href="/Pottage" title="Pottage">pottage</a>, a meat and vegetable concoction originating in Roman times. This was prepared in a large cauldron, the ingredients being slow cooked, with dried fruits, sugar and spices added. In the 15th century, <i>Plum pottage</i> was a sloppy mix of meat, vegetables and fruit served at the beginning of a meal.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.icons.org.uk/nom/nominations/christmas-pudding-1" rel="nofollow">Christmas pudding: Icons of England</a> Retrieved December 25, 2010&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>There is a popular and wholly unsubstantiated myth that in 1714, <a href="/George_I_of_Great_Britain" title="George I of Great Britain">King George I</a> (sometimes known as the Pudding King)&#60;ref name=plyb/&#62; requested that plum pudding be served as part of his royal feast in his first Christmas in England.&#60;ref name=plyb/&#62; A recipe for &#34;plum porridge&#34; appeared in <i>Christmas Entertainments</i> in 1740.&#60;ref name=plyb/&#62; As techniques for meat preserving improved in the 18th century, the savoury element of both the mince pie and the plum pottage diminished as the sweet content increased. The mince pie kept its name, though the pottage was increasingly referred to as <i>plum pudding</i>. Although the latter was always a celebratory dish it was originally eaten at the <a href="/Harvest_festival" title="Harvest festival">Harvest Festival</a>, not Christmas. It was not until the 1830s that the cannonball of flour, fruits, suet, sugar and spices, all topped with holly, made a definite appearance, becoming more and more associated with Christmas. In 1747, London food writer <a href="/Hannah_Glasse" title="Hannah Glasse">Hannah Glasse</a> had given a recipe for Christmas plum porridge, but it appears that <a href="/East_Sussex" title="East Sussex">East Sussex</a> cook <a href="/Eliza_Acton" title="Eliza Acton">Eliza Acton</a> was the first to refer to it as &#34;Christmas Pudding&#34; in her <a href="/Cookbook" title="Cookbook">cookbook</a>.&#60;ref&#62;Harlan Walker <i>Oxford Symposium on Food &#38; Cookery, 1990: feasting and fasting : proceedings</i> pp.36, 45. Prospect Books, 1991&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>The custom of eating Christmas pudding was carried to many parts of the world by British colonists, however, it is not generally as popular and common a dish outside the <a href="/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> and <a href="/Ireland" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>.</p>

<p>Once turned out of its basin, decorated with holly, doused in brandy (or occasionally rum), and <a href="/Flamb%C3%A9" title="Flambé">flamed</a> (or &#34;fired&#34;), the pudding is traditionally brought to the table ceremoniously, and greeted with a round of applause.

<p>&#60;blockquote&#62;&#34;Mrs Cratchit left the room alone – too nervous to bear witnesses – to take the pudding up and bring it in... Hallo! A great deal of steam! The pudding was out of the copper which smells like a washing-day. That was the cloth. A smell like an eating-house and a pastrycook&#39;s next door to each other, with a laundress&#39;s next door to that. That was the pudding. In half a minute Mrs. Cratchit entered – flushed, but smiling proudly – with the pudding, like a speckled cannon-ball, so hard and firm, blazing in half of half-a-quarter of ignited brandy, and bedight with Christmas holly stuck into the top.&#34;&#60;ref&#62;Charles Dickens <a class="external text" href="https://books.google.com/books?id=6t6C8Uvzt9EC&#38;pg=PA31" rel="nofollow">A Christmas Carol, the Chimes, and the Cricket on the Hearth</a> Digireads.com Publishing, 2008&#60;/ref&#62;&#60;/blockquote&#62;</p>
