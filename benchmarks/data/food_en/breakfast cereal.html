<p><a href="/Ferdinand_Schumacher" title="Ferdinand Schumacher">Ferdinand Schumacher</a>, a German immigrant, began the cereals revolution in 1854 with a hand oats grinder in the back room of a small store in, <a href="/Akron%2C_Ohio" title="Akron, Ohio">Akron, Ohio</a>. His <a href="/German_Mills_American_Oatmeal_Company" title="German Mills American Oatmeal Company">German Mills American Oatmeal Company</a> was the nation&#39;s first commercial oatmeal manufacturer. He marketed the product locally as a substitute for breakfast pork. Improved production technology (steel cutters, porcelain rollers, improved hullers), combined with  an influx of German and Irish immigrants, quickly boosted sales and profits. In 1877,  Schumacher adopted the Quaker symbol, the first registered trademark for a breakfast cereal. The acceptance of &#34;horse food&#34; for human consumption encouraged other entrepreneurs to enter the industry. <a href="/Henry_Parsons_Crowell" title="Henry Parsons Crowell">Henry Parsons Crowell</a> started operations in 1882, and John Robert Stuart in 1885.&#60;ref&#62;Joe Musser, <i>The Cereal Tycoon: Henry Parsons Crowell: Founder of the Quaker Oats Co.</i> (2002)&#60;/ref&#62;  Crowell cut costs by consolidating every step of the processing—grading, cleaning, hulling, cutting, rolling, packaging, and shipping—in one factory operating at <a href="/Ravenna%2C_Ohio" title="Ravenna, Ohio">Ravenna, Ohio</a>. Stuart operated mills in Chicago and <a href="/Cedar_Rapids%2C_Iowa" title="Cedar Rapids, Iowa">Cedar Rapids, Iowa</a>. Stuart and Crowell combined in 1885 and initiated a price war. After a fire at his mill in Akron, Schumacher joined Stuart and Crowell to form the Consolidated Oatmeal Company. The American Cereal Company (<a href="/Quaker_Oats" title="Quaker Oats">Quaker Oats</a>, but see below) created a cereal made from oats in 1877, manufacturing the product in <a href="/Akron%2C_Ohio" title="Akron, Ohio">Akron, Ohio</a>.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/entry.php?rec=833&#38;nm=American-Cereal-Company" rel="nofollow">&#34;American Cereal Company&#34;</a>, Ohio History Central&#60;/ref&#62; Separately, in 1888, a trust or holding company combined the nation&#39;s seven largest mills into the American Cereal Company using the Quaker Oats brand name. By 1900 technology, entrepreneurship, and the &#34;Man in Quaker Garb&#34;—a symbol of plain honesty and reliability—gave Quaker Oats a national market and annual sales of $10 million.&#60;ref&#62;Arthur F.

<p>Early in the 20th century, the Quaker Oats Company (formed in 1901 to replace the American Cereal Company) jumped into the world market. Schumacher, the innovator; Stuart, the manager and financial leader and Crowell, the creative merchandiser, advertiser, and promoter, doubled sales every decade. Alexander Anderson&#39;s steam-pressure method of shooting rice from guns created <a href="/Puffed_rice" title="Puffed rice">Puffed rice</a> and puffed wheat. Crowell&#39;s intensive advertising campaign in the 1920s and 1930s featured promotions with such celebrities as <a href="/Babe_Ruth" title="Babe Ruth">Babe Ruth</a>, <a href="/Max_Baer_(boxer)" title="Max Baer (boxer)">Max Baer</a>, and <a href="/Shirley_Temple" title="Shirley Temple">Shirley Temple</a>.

Meat rationing during World War II boosted annual sales to $90 million, and by 1956 sales topped $277 million. By 1964 the firm sold over 200 products, grossed over $500 million, and claimed that 8 million people ate Quaker Oats each day. Expansion included acquisition of Aunt Jemima Mills Company in 1926, which continues as a leading brand of pancake mixes and syrup, the sport drink <a href="/Gatorade" title="Gatorade">Gatorade</a> in 1983, and in 1986, the Golden Grain Company, producers of <a href="/Rice-A-Roni" title="Rice-A-Roni">Rice-A-Roni</a> canned lunch food.

Packaged breakfast cereals were considerably more convenient than a product that had to be cooked and — combined with clever marketing — they became popular. <a href="/Battle_Creek%2C_Michigan" title="Battle Creek, Michigan">Battle Creek, Michigan</a> was a center both of the <a href="/Seventh-day_Adventist_Church" title="Seventh-day Adventist Church">Seventh-day Adventist Church</a> and of innovation in the ready-to-eat cereal industry. And indeed, the church had a substantial impact on the development of cereal goods through the person of <a href="/John_Harvey_Kellogg" title="John Harvey Kellogg">John Harvey Kellogg</a> (1851-1943). Son of an Adventist factory owner in Battle Creek, Kellogg was encouraged by his church to train in medicine at <a href="/Bellevue_Hospital_Medical_College" title="Bellevue Hospital Medical College">Bellevue Hospital Medical College</a> in New York City in 1875. After graduating, he became medical superintendent at the <a href="/Battle_Creek_Sanitarium" title="Battle Creek Sanitarium">Western Health Reform Institute</a> in Battle Creek, established in 1866 by the Adventists to offer their natural remedies for illness.  Many wealthy industrialists came to Kellogg&#39;s sanitarium for recuperation and rejuvenation. They were accustomed to breakfasts of ham, eggs, sausages, fried potatoes, hot biscuits, hotcakes, and coffee. In Battle Creek they found fresh air, exercise, rest, &#34;hydrotherapy&#34;, a strict vegetarian diet, and abstinence from alcohol, tobacco, coffee, and tea. To supplement the center&#39;s vegetarian regimen, Kellogg experimented with granola. Soon afterwards he began to experiment with wheat, resulting in a lighter, flakier product. In 1891 he acquired a patent and then in 1895 he launched the <a href="/Cornflakes" title="Cornflakes">Cornflakes</a> brand, which overnight captured a national market. Soon there were forty rival manufacturers in the Battle Creek area. His brother <a href="/William_K._Kellogg" title="William K. Kellogg">William K. Kellogg</a> (1860-1951) worked for him for many years until, in 1906, he broke away, bought the rights to <a href="/Corn_flakes" title="Corn flakes">Cornflakes</a>, and set up the Kellogg Toasted Corn Flake Company. William Kellogg discarded the health food concept, opting for heavy advertising and commercial taste appeal. Later, his signature on every package became the company trademark.&#60;ref&#62;Horace B. Powell, <i>The Original Has This Signature--W. K. Kellogg</i> (1956)&#60;/ref&#62;&#60;ref&#62;Ron Hotchkiss, &#34;Kelloggs of Battle Creek,&#34; <i>American History</i> (1995) 29#6 pp 62-66.&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>The second major innovator in the cereal industry was <a href="/Charles_W._Post" title="Charles W. Post">Charles W. Post</a>, a salesman who was admitted to Kellogg&#39;s sanitarium as a patient in the late 1800s. While there, he grew deeply impressed with their all-grain diet. Upon his release, he began experimenting with grain products, beginning with an all-grain coffee substitute called Postum. In 1898 he introduced <a href="/Grape-nuts" title="Grape-nuts">Grape-nuts</a>, the concentrated cereal with a nutty flavor (containing neither grapes or nuts). Good business sense, determination, and powerful advertising produced a multimillion-dollar fortune for Post in a few years.  After his death, his company acquired the Jell-O company in 1925, Baker&#39;s chocolate in 1927, Maxwell House coffee in 1928, and Birdseye frozen foods in 1929. In 1929, the company changed its name to General Foods. In 1985, <a href="/Philip_Morris_Tobacco_Company" title="Philip Morris Tobacco Company">Philip Morris Tobacco Company</a> bought General Foods for $5.6 billion and merged it with its Kraft division.&#60;ref&#62;Peyton Paxson, &#34;Charles William Post: The Mass Marketing of Health and Welfare.&#34; PhD Dissertation Boston U. 1993. 443 pp.   DAI 1993 54(3): 981-982-A.

In 1921, <a href="/James_Ford_Bell" title="James Ford Bell">James Ford Bell</a>, president of a Minneapolis wheat milling firm, began experimenting with rolled wheat flakes.

In 1928, four milling companies consolidated as the General Mills Company in Minneapolis.
