<p>Like <a href="/Caraway" title="Caraway">caraway</a>, the fernlike leaves of dill are aromatic and are used to flavor many <a href="/Food" title="Food">foods</a> such as <a href="/Gravlax" title="Gravlax">gravlax</a> (cured <a href="/Salmon" title="Salmon">salmon</a>) and other <a href="/Fish_(food)" title="Fish (food)">fish</a> dishes, <a href="/Borscht" title="Borscht">borscht</a> and other <a href="/Soup" title="Soup">soups</a>, as well as <a href="/Pickled_cucumber" title="Pickled cucumber">pickles</a> (where the dill flower is sometimes used). Dill is best when used fresh as it loses its flavor rapidly if dried; however, <a href="/Freeze_drying" title="Freeze drying">freeze-dried</a> dill leaves retain their flavor relatively well for a few months.</p>
<p>Dill seed, having a flavor similar to caraway but also resembling that of fresh or dried dill weed,&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.whfoods.com/genpage.php?tname=foodspice&#38;dbid=71#historyuse" rel="nofollow">Whole Foods Profile</a>{{verify credibility|date=July 2012}}&#60;/ref&#62; is used as a <a href="/Spice" title="Spice">spice</a>. <a href="/Dill_oil" title="Dill oil">Dill oil</a> is extracted from the leaves, stems and seeds of the plant.

<p>Dill is the <a href="/Eponymous" title="Eponymous">eponymous</a> ingredient in dill <a href="/Pickled_cucumber" title="Pickled cucumber">pickles</a>: cucumbers preserved in salty brine and/or vinegar.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="European_cuisine">European cuisine</span></h3>
<p>In <a href="/Central_Europe" title="Central Europe">central</a> and <a href="/Eastern_Europe" title="Eastern Europe">eastern Europe</a>, <a href="/Scandinavia" title="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</a>, <a href="/Russia" title="Russia">Russia</a> and <a href="/Finland" title="Finland">Finland</a>, dill is a popular <a href="/Herb#culinary_herbs" title="Herb">culinary herb</a> used in the kitchen along with parsley. Fresh, finely cut dill leaves are used as topping in soups, especially the hot red <a href="/Borsht" title="Borsht">borsht</a> and the cold borsht mixed with curds, kefir, yoghurt, or sour cream, which is served during hot summer weather and is called <a href="/Okroshka" title="Okroshka">okroshka</a>. It is also popular in summer to drink fermented milk (curds, kefir, yoghurt, or buttermilk) mixed with dill (and sometimes other herbs).</p>
<p>In the same way, prepared dill is used as a topping for boiled potatoes covered with fresh butter&#38;nbsp;– especially in summer when there are so-called &#34;new,&#34; or young, potatoes. The dill leaves can be mixed with butter, making a dill butter, which can serve the same purpose. Dill leaves mixed with <a href="/Tvorog" title="Tvorog">tvorog</a> form one of the traditional cheese spreads used for sandwiches. Fresh dill leaves are used all year round as an ingredient in salads, <i>e.g.</i>, one made of lettuce, fresh cucumbers and tomatoes, the way <a href="/Basil" title="Basil">basil</a> leaves are used in Italy and Greece.</p>
<p>In Poland, fresh dill leaves mixed with sour cream are the basis for dressings,. It is especially popular to use this kind of sauce with freshly cut cucumbers, which practically are wholly immersed in the sauce, making a salad called &#34;mizeria&#34;. The dill leaves serve as a basis for cooking dill sauce, used hot for baked freshwater fish and for chicken or turkey breast, or used hot or cold for hard-boiled eggs.</p>
<p>In south-eastern Poland it is popular to cook a dill-based soup (zupa koperkowa), served with potatoes and hard-boiled eggs. Whole stems including roots and flower buds are traditionally used to prepare Polish-style pickled cucumbers (<a href="/Og%C3%B3rki_kiszone" title="Ogórki kiszone">ogórki kiszone</a>), especially the so-called low-salt cucumbers (&#34;ogórki małosolne&#34;). Whole stems of dill (often including the roots) are also cooked with potatoes, especially the potatoes of autumn and winter, so they resemble the flavor of the newer potatoes found in summer. Some kinds of fish, especially trout and salmon, are traditionally baked with the stems and leaves of dill.</p>
<p>In Germany, dill is popular as a seasoning for fish and many other dishes, chopped as a garnish on potatoes, and a flavoring in pickles.</p>
<p>In <a href="/Romania" title="Romania">Romania</a> dill (<i>mărar</i>) is widely used as an ingredient for soups such as <i>borş</i> (pronounced &#34;borsh&#34;), pickles and other dishes, especially those based on peas, beans and cabbage. It is popular for dishes based on potatoes and mushrooms and can be found in many summer salads (especially cucumber salad, cabbage salad and lettuce salad). During springtime, it is used with spring onions in omelets. It often complements sauces based on sour cream or yogurt and is mixed with salted cheese and used as a filling. Another popular dish with dill as a main ingredient is dill sauce, which is served with eggs and fried sausages.</p>
<p>In <a href="/Hungary" title="Hungary">Hungary</a>, dill is very widely used. It is popular as a sauce or filling, especially in <a href="/Langos" title="Langos">Langos</a>, and mixed with a type of cottage cheese. Dill is also used for <a href="/Pickling" title="Pickling">pickling</a> and in salads. The Hungarian name for dill is <i>kapor</i>.</p>
<p>In <a href="/Serbia" title="Serbia">Serbia</a>, dill is known as <i>mirodjija</i> and is used as an addition to soups, potato and cucumber salads and French fries. It features in the Serbian proverb &#34;бити мирођија у свакој чорби&#34; /biti mirodjija u svakoj čorbi/ (to be a dill in every soup) which corresponds to the English proverb &#34;to have a finger in every pie&#34;.</p>
<p>In <a href="/Greece" title="Greece">Greece</a>, dill is known as &#39;άνηθος&#39; (anithos). In antiquity it was used as an add-in in wines, which they were called &#34;anithites oinos&#34; (wine with anithos-dill). In modern days, dill is used in salads, soups, sauces, and fish and vegetable dishes.</p>
<p>In <a href="/Santa_Maria_Island_(Azores)" title="Santa Maria Island (Azores)">Santa Maria</a>, <a href="/Azores" title="Azores">Azores</a>, dill (<i>endro</i>) is the most important ingredient of the traditional Holy Ghost soup (<i>sopa do Espírito Santo</i>). Dill is found practically everywhere in Santa Maria and is curiously rare in the other Azorean Islands.</p>
<p>In <a href="/Sweden" title="Sweden">Sweden</a>, dill is a common spice or herb. The top of fully grown dill is called <i>krondill</i> (English: Crown dill); this is used when cooking <a href="/Crayfish" title="Crayfish">crayfish</a>. The <i>krondill</i> is put in to the water after the crayfish is boiled, but still in hot and salt water. Then the entire dish is stored in refrigerator for at least 24 hours before eating (with toasted bread and butter). <i>Krondill</i> is also used for <a href="/Cucumber" title="Cucumber">cucumber</a> <a href="/Pickled_cucumber" title="Pickled cucumber">pickles</a>. Small cucumbers, sliced or not, are put into a solution of hot water, mild acetic vinegar (not made from wine and without colour), sugar and <i>krondill</i>. After a month or two, the cucumber pickles are ready to eat, for instance, with pork, brown sauce and potatoes, as a &#34;sweetener&#34;. The thinner part of dill and young plants may be used with boiled fresh potatoes (as the first potatoes for the year, which usually are small and have a very thin skin). It is used together with, or instead of other green herbs, like <a href="/Parsley" title="Parsley">parsley</a>, <a href="/Chives" title="Chives">chives</a> and <a href="/Basil" title="Basil">basil</a>, in salads.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Cultivation">Cultivation</span></h2>
<p>Successful cultivation requires warm to hot summers with high sunshine levels; even partial shade will reduce the yield substantially. It also prefers rich, well drained soil. The seeds are viable for three to ten years.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}</p>
<p>The seed is harvested by cutting the flower heads off the stalks when the seed is beginning to ripen. The seed heads are placed upside down in a paper bag and left in a warm, dry place for a week. The seeds then separate from the stems easily for storage in an airtight container.</p>
