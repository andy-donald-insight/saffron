<p>The roots of apple butter lie in <a href="/Province_of_Limburg_(1815%E2%80%931839)" title="Province of Limburg (1815–1839)">Limburg</a> (Belgium and the Netherlands) and <a href="/Rhineland" title="Rhineland">Rhineland</a> (Germany), conceived during the <a href="/Middle_Ages" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a>, when the first <a href="/Monasteries" title="Monasteries">monasteries</a> (with large fruit yards) appeared. The production of the butter was a perfect way to conserve part of the fruit production of the monasteries&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external free" href="http://www.slowfood.nl/userfiles/publicaties/177_sf_arkvdsmaakbrochure_lowres.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.slowfood.nl/userfiles/publicaties/177_sf_arkvdsmaakbrochure_lowres.pdf</a> (in Dutch)&#60;/ref&#62; in that region, at a time when almost every village had its own apple-butter producers. The production of apple butter was also a popular way of using apples in <a href="/Colonial_America" title="Colonial America">colonial America</a>, well into the 19th century.</p>
<p>The product contains no actual dairy butter; the term &#34;butter&#34; refers only to the thick, soft butter-like consistency, and apple butter&#39;s use as a spread for breads. Typically seasoned with <a href="/Cinnamon" title="Cinnamon">cinnamon</a>, <a href="/Clove" title="Clove">clove</a>, and other spices, apple butter is usually spread on bread, used as a side dish, an ingredient in baked goods, or as a condiment. Apple butter is also used on a sandwich to add an interesting flavor, but is not as commonly used as in historical times.</p>
<p><a href="/Vinegar" title="Vinegar">Vinegar</a> is sometimes mixed in while cooking to provide a small amount of tartness to the usually sweet apple butter.

<p>In areas of the <a href="/American_South" title="American South">American South</a>, the production of apple butter is a family event, due to the large amount of labor necessary to produce apple butter in large quantities.  Traditionally, apple butter was prepared in large copper kettles outside. Large paddles were used to stir the apples, and family members would take turns stirring. In <a href="/Appalachia" title="Appalachia">Appalachia</a>, apple butter was the only type of fruit preserve normally rendered into <a href="/Fruit_leather" title="Fruit leather">fruit leather</a>.</p>
<p>In Europe, apple butter is commonly used in the <a href="/Netherlands" title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a> (known as <a href="//nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appelstroop"><i>appelstroop</i> (apple syrup)</a>) and in Germany (known as <b>{{Ill|de|Apfelkraut}}</b> (apple kraut)]]) and frequently eaten on bread with (or without) thinly sliced cheese and with <i><a href="/Sauerbraten" title="Sauerbraten">Sauerbraten</a></i>. A sweeter version, made using pears, as well as apples, is more popular in Belgium, where it is known as <b><a href="/Sirop_de_Li%C3%A8ge" title="Sirop de Liège">Sirop de Liège</a></b>. Other than in <a href="/Benelux" title="Benelux">Benelux</a> and the Rhineland, apple syrup is a minority taste in <a href="/Western_Europe" title="Western Europe">Western Europe</a> (in Germany, outside of the Rhineland, it is generally sold in <a href="/Health_food_store" title="Health food store">health food shops</a>), and a similar food is produced in francophone <a href="/Switzerland" title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>, where it is known as <a href="//fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vin_cuit_(Suisse)"><i>vin cuit</i></a>.</p>

The final product should contain no more than 34% of moisture and about 60% of sugar. The most popular one is made from apples, but <i>povidlo</i> is also made from apricots, cherries, prunes, pears, and cranberries.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Dietary_iron">Dietary iron</span></h2>
<p>In the Netherlands &#34;appelstroop&#34; is widely recognised as a good source of iron, a dietary element in which modern diets are frequently <a href="/Iron_deficiency" title="Iron deficiency">considered deficient</a>.   There is a widespread view that the iron content arises from the interaction of the acid in the apples with the metal of vessels in which the appelstroop is prepared and / or packaged.&#60;ref name=RosKen&#62;{{cite web |url=<a class="external free" href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2621.1982.tb10134.x/abstract" rel="nofollow">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2621.1982.tb10134.x/abstract</a>|author1=A.

Proc.</i> (<b>1979</b>) 38(3): 454&#60;/ref&#62;   However, commercially sold appelstroop is almost invariably sold in paper or plastic based containers (or, in Germany, glass jars) and well into the fifties the traditional cooking pots used for its preparation were generally of copper. Regardless of how appelstroop originally gained its reputation as a source of dietary iron, the iron content (10–20&#38;nbsp;mg per 100 gm) in typical factory produced product is boosted by the <a href="/Sugar_beet" title="Sugar beet">sugar beet</a>, which is included with apples in the approximate ratio of 30:70.  The cooking process thickens the texture of the sugar beet syrup, providing the extra sweetness which modern tastes expect and increases the proportion of various mineral elements including the iron which is already present before cooking in both apples and sugar beet.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Events">Events</span></h2>
<p>In various locations across the <a href="/United_States" title="United States">United States</a>, the production of apple butter is associated with a community event, most often occurring in the fall at the end of the apple-harvest season. At many of these events, apple butter is cooked on-site in the traditional method, using huge copper kettles over open fires that are stirred for hours.</p>
