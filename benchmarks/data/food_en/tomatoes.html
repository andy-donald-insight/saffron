It was probably eaten shortly after it was introduced, and was certainly being used as food by the early 17th century in Spain. The earliest discovered cookbook with tomato recipes was published in <a href="/Naples" title="Naples">Naples</a> in 1692, though the author had apparently obtained these recipes from Spanish sources.&#60;ref name=&#34;the tomato in America&#34;/&#62;{{rp|17}} In certain areas of Italy, such as Florence, however, the fruit was used solely as a tabletop decoration before it was incorporated into the local cuisine in the late 17th or early 18th century.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Italy">Italy</span></h3>
<p>The recorded history of tomatoes in Italy dates back to 31 October 1548 when the house steward of <a href="/Cosimo_de&#39;_Medici" title="Cosimo de&#39; Medici">Cosimo de&#39; Medici</a>, the grand duke of <a href="/Tuscany" title="Tuscany">Tuscany</a>, wrote to the Medici private secretary informing him that the basket of tomatoes sent from the grand duke&#39;s Florentine estate at <a href="/Torre_del_Gallo" title="Torre del Gallo">Torre del Gallo</a> &#34;had arrived safely.&#34; Tomatoes were grown mainly as ornamentals early on after their arrival in Italy. For example, the Florentine aristocrat Giovanvettorio Soderini wrote how they &#34;were to be sought only for their beauty&#34; and were grown only in gardens or flower beds. The tomato&#39;s ability to mutate and create new and different varieties helped contribute to its success and spread throughout Italy. However, even in areas where the climate supported growing tomatoes, their proximity of growing to the ground suggested low status. They were not adopted as a staple of the peasant population because they were not as filling as other fruits already available. Additionally, both toxic and inedible varieties discouraged many people from attempting to consume or prepare them.&#60;ref&#62;Gentilcore, David (2010) <i>A History of the Tomato in Italy Pomodoro!</i> New York, NY: Columbia University Press, <a class="external text" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/023115206" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/023115206">ISBN 023115206</a>X.&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>Unique varieties were developed over the next several hundred years for uses such as dried tomatoes, sauce tomatoes, pizza tomatoes, and tomatoes for long term storage. These varieties are usually known for their place of origin as much as by a variety name. For example, Pomodorino del Piennolo del Vesuvio is the &#34;hanging tomato of Vesuvius&#34;. Five different varieties have traditionally been used to make these &#34;hanging&#34; tomatoes. They are Fiaschella, Lampadina, Patanara, Principe Borghese, and Re Umberto. Other tomatoes that originated in Italy include San Marzano, Borgo Cellano, Christopher Columbus, Costoluto Genovese, and Italian Pear. These tomatoes are characterized by relatively intense flavor compared to varieties typically grown elsewhere.</p>

<p>Alexander W. Livingston was the first person who succeeded in upgrading the wild tomato, developing different breeds and stabilizing the plants. In the 1937 yearbook of the Federal Department of Agriculture, it was declared that &#34;half of the major varieties were a result of the abilities of the Livingstons to evaluate and perpetuate superior material in the tomato&#34;. Livingston&#39;s first breed of tomato, the Paragon, was introduced in 1870. In 1875, he introduced the Acme, which was said to be involved in the parentage of most of the tomatoes introduced by him and his competitors for the next twenty-five years.&#60;ref name=&#34;About Reynoldsburg&#34;&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20110111123746/http://www.ci.reynoldsburg.oh.us/about-reynoldsburg.aspx" rel="nofollow">About Reynoldsburg</a>. ci.reynoldsburg.oh.us&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>When Alexander W. Livingston had begun his attempts to develop the tomato as a commercial crop, his aim had been to grow tomatoes smooth in contour, uniform in size and having better flavor. One year, after many attempts, he passed through his fields, picking out particular tomato plants having distinct characteristics and heavy foliage. He saved the seeds carefully. The following spring he set two rows across his family garden located just below the hill and milk house. To his happy surprise, each plant bore perfect tomatoes like the parent vine. After five years, the fruit became fleshier and larger. In 1870, Alexander introduced the Paragon and tomato culture soon became a great enterprise in the county. Today, the crop is grown in every state in the Union. He eventually developed over seventeen different varieties of the tomato plant.&#60;ref name=&#34;About Reynoldsburg&#34;/&#62;</p>

<p>Evidence has been found that 10−20% of the total carbon fixed in the fruit can be produced by photosynthesis in the developing fruit of the normal U phenotype.  The u genetic mutation encodes a factor that produces defective chloroplasts with lower density in developing fruit, resulting in a lighter green colour of unripe fruit, and repression of sugars accumulation in the resulting ripe fruit by 10−15%.   Perhaps more important than their role in photosynthesis, the fruit chloroplasts are remodelled during ripening into chlorophyll-free chromoplasts that synthesize and accumulate lycopene, β-carotene, and other metabolites that are sensory and nutritional assets of the ripe fruit.  The potent chloroplasts in the dark-green shoulders of the U phenotype are beneficial here, but have the disadvantage of leaving green shoulders near the stems of the ripe fruit, and even cracked yellow shoulders, apparently because of oxidative stress due to overload of the photosynthetic chain in direct sunlight at high temperatures.  Hence genetic design of a commercial variety that combines the advantages of types u and U requires fine tuning, but may be feasible.&#60;ref name=Cocaliadis&#62;{{cite journal| title=Increasing tomato fruit quality by enhancing fruit chloroplast function.

<p>Hybrid plants remain common, since they tend to be heavier producers, and sometimes combine unusual characteristics of heirloom tomatoes with the ruggedness of conventional commercial tomatoes.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}</p>
<p>Tomato varieties are roughly divided into several categories, based mostly on shape and size.
</p>
<ul>
<li>&#34;Slicing&#34; or &#34;globe&#34; tomatoes are the usual tomatoes of commerce, used for a wide variety of processing and fresh eating.</li>
<li><a href="/Beefsteak_(tomato)" title="Beefsteak (tomato)">Beefsteak</a> tomatoes are large tomatoes often used for <a href="/Tomato_sandwich" title="Tomato sandwich">sandwiches</a> and similar applications. Their kidney-bean shape, thinner skin, and shorter shelf life makes commercial use impractical.</li>
<li>Oxheart tomatoes can range in size up to beefsteaks, and are shaped like large strawberries.</li>
<li><a href="/Plum_tomato" title="Plum tomato">Plum tomatoes</a>, or paste tomatoes (including pear tomatoes), are bred with a higher solids content for use in <a href="/Tomato_sauce" title="Tomato sauce">tomato sauce</a> and <a href="/Tomato_paste" title="Tomato paste">paste</a>, and are usually oblong.</li>
<li>Pear tomatoes are pear-shaped, and are based upon the <a href="/San_Marzano_tomato" title="San Marzano tomato">San Marzano</a> types for a richer gourmet paste.</li>
<li><a href="/Cherry_tomato" title="Cherry tomato">Cherry tomatoes</a> are small and round, often sweet tomatoes generally eaten whole in salads.</li>
<li><a href="/Grape_tomato" title="Grape tomato">Grape tomatoes</a>, a more recent introduction, are smaller and oblong, a variation on plum tomatoes, and used in salads.</li>
<li><a href="/Campari_tomato" title="Campari tomato">Campari tomatoes</a> are also sweet and noted for their juiciness, low acidity, and lack of mealiness. They are bigger than cherry tomatoes, but are smaller than plum tomatoes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Early tomatoes and cool-summer tomatoes bear fruit even where nights are cool, which usually discourages fruit set. There are also varieties high in beta carotenes and vitamin A, hollow tomatoes and tomatoes that keep for months in storage.</p>
<p>Tomatoes are also commonly classified as <a href="/Determinate_cultivar" title="Determinate cultivar">determinate</a> or <a href="/Indeterminate_growth" title="Indeterminate growth">indeterminate</a>. Determinate, or bush, types bear a full crop all at once and top off at a specific height; they are often good choices for container growing. Determinate types are preferred by commercial growers who wish to harvest a whole field at one time, or home growers interested in canning. Indeterminate varieties develop into vines that never top off and continue producing until killed by frost. They are preferred by home growers and local-market farmers who want ripe fruit throughout the season. As an intermediate form, there are plants sometimes known as vigorous determinate or semideterminate; these top off like determinates, but produce a second crop after the initial crop. The majority of heirloom tomatoes are indeterminate, although some determinate heirlooms exist.</p>
<p>Most modern tomato cultivars are smooth surfaced, but some older tomato cultivars and most modern beefsteaks often show pronounced ribbing, a feature that may have been common to virtually all <a href="/Pre-Columbian" title="Pre-Columbian">pre-Columbian</a> cultivars. While virtually all commercial tomato varieties are red, some cultivars – especially heirlooms – produce fruit in other colors, including green, yellow, orange, pink, black, brown, ivory, white, and purple. Such fruits are not widely available in grocery stores, nor are their seedlings available in typical nurseries, but they can be bought as seed. Less common variations include fruit with stripes (Green Zebra), fuzzy skin on the fruit (Fuzzy Peach, Red Boar), multiple colors (<a href="/Hillbilly_(tomato)" title="Hillbilly (tomato)">Hillbilly</a>, Burracker&#39;s Favorite, Lucky Cross), etc.</p>
<p>There is also a considerable gap between commercial and home-gardener cultivars. Home cultivars are often bred for flavor to the exclusion of all other qualities, while commercial cultivars are bred for factors like consistent size and shape, disease and pest resistance, suitability for mechanized picking and shipping, and ability to ripen after picking.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}</p>
<p>Tomatoes grow well with seven hours of sunlight a day. A fertilizer with an <a href="/NPK_rating" title="NPK rating">NPK ratio</a> of 5-10-10 is often sold as tomato fertilizer or vegetable fertilizer, although manure and compost are also used.</p>

In the wild, original state, tomatoes required cross-<a href="/Pollination" title="Pollination">pollination</a>; they were much more <a href="/Self-incompatibility_in_plants" title="Self-incompatibility in plants">self-incompatible</a> than domestic cultivars. As a floral device to reduce selfing, the <a href="/Pistil" title="Pistil">pistil</a> of wild tomatoes extends farther out of the flower than today&#39;s cultivars. The <a href="/Stamen" title="Stamen">stamens</a> were, and remain, entirely within the closed <a href="/Petal" title="Petal">corolla</a>.</p>
<p>As tomatoes were moved from their native areas, their traditional <a href="/Pollinator" title="Pollinator">pollinators</a>, (probably a species of <a href="/Halictidae" title="Halictidae">halictid bee</a>) did not move with them.&#60;ref name=&#34;Sharma2012&#34;&#62;{{cite book|author=Sharma, V.

<p>This is not the same as <a href="/Self-pollination" title="Self-pollination">self-pollination</a>, despite the common claim that tomatoes do so. That tomatoes pollinate themselves poorly without outside aid is clearly shown in <a href="/Greenhouse" title="Greenhouse">greenhouse</a> situations, where pollination must be aided by artificial wind, vibration of the plants (one brand of vibrator is a wand called an &#34;electric bee&#34; that is used manually), or more often today, by cultured <a href="/Bumblebee" title="Bumblebee">bumblebees</a>.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} The <a href="/Anther" title="Anther">anther</a> of a tomato flower is shaped like a hollow tube, with the <a href="/Pollen" title="Pollen">pollen</a> produced within the structure, rather than on the surface, as in most species. The pollen moves through pores in the anther, but very little pollen is shed without some kind of outside motion. The best source of outside motion is a <a href="/Buzz_pollination" title="Buzz pollination">sonicating</a> bee, such as a bumblebee, or the original wild halictid pollinator. In an outside setting, wind or animals provide sufficient motion to produce commercially viable crops.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Fruit_formation">Fruit formation</span></h3>
<p>Pollination and fruit formation depend on <a href="/Meiosis" title="Meiosis">meiosis</a>.  Meiosis is central to the processes by which diploid microspore mother cells within the anther give rise to haploid pollen grains, and megaspore mother cells in ovules that are contained within the ovary give rise to haploid nuclei.  Union of haploid nuclei from pollen and ovule (fertilization) can occur either by self- or cross-pollination.  Fertilization leads to the formation of a diploid zygote that can then develop into an embryo within the emerging seed.  Repeated fertilizations within the ovary are accompanied by maturation of the ovary to form the tomato fruit.</p>

Tomato plants are vines, initially <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/decumbent">decumbent</a>, typically growing {{convert|180|cm|ft|abbr=on|0}} or more above the ground if supported, although erect bush varieties have been bred, generally {{convert|100|cm|ft|abbr=on|0}} tall or shorter. Indeterminate types are &#34;tender&#34; perennials, dying annually in temperate climates (they are originally native to tropical highlands), although they can live up to three years in a greenhouse in some cases. Determinate types are annual in all climates.</p>
<p>Tomato plants are <a href="/Dicot" title="Dicot">dicots</a>, and grow as a series of branching stems, with a terminal bud at the tip that does the actual growing. When that tip eventually stops growing, whether because of pruning or flowering, lateral buds take over and grow into other, fully functional, vines.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web | url = <a class="external free" href="http://www.ncsu.edu/sustainable/profiles/bot_tom.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ncsu.edu/sustainable/profiles/bot_tom.html</a>| archiveurl = <a class="external free" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091126050832/http://www.ncsu.edu/sustainable/profiles/bot_tom.html" rel="nofollow">https://web.archive.org/web/20091126050832/http://www.ncsu.edu/sustainable/profiles/bot_tom.html</a>| archivedate = 2009-11-26| title = Crop Profiles – Tomato| accessdate = 27 October 2008 | first = M. | last = Peet }}{{Self-published inline|date=February 2010}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>Tomato vines are typically pubescent, meaning covered with fine short hairs. These hairs facilitate the vining process, turning into roots wherever the plant is in contact with the ground and moisture, especially if the vine&#39;s connection to its original root has been damaged or severed.</p>
<p>Most tomato plants have <a href="/Compound_leaves" title="Compound leaves">compound leaves</a>, and are called regular leaf (RL) plants, but some cultivars have simple leaves known as <a href="/Potato_leaf" title="Potato leaf">potato leaf</a> (PL) style because of their resemblance to that particular relative. Of RL plants, there are variations, such as rugose leaves, which are deeply grooved, and <a href="/Variegated" title="Variegated">variegated</a>, angora leaves, which have additional colors where a genetic mutation causes <a href="/Chlorophyll" title="Chlorophyll">chlorophyll</a> to  be excluded from some portions of the leaves.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web | url = <a class="external free" href="http://faq.gardenweb.com/faq/lists/tomato/2004111539004321.html" rel="nofollow">http://faq.gardenweb.com/faq/lists/tomato/2004111539004321.html</a> | title = Are there different types of tomato leaves? | publisher = <a href="/IVillage" title="IVillage">IVillage</a>| accessdate = 27 October 2008 }}{{Unreliable source?|date=February 2010}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>The <a href="/Leaf" title="Leaf">leaves</a> are {{convert|10|-|25|cm|in|0|sp=us|abbr=on}} long, odd pinnate, with five to 9 leaflets on petioles,&#60;ref&#62;{{ cite book | author = Acquaah, G. | year = 2002 | title = Horticulture: Principles and Practices |isbn=0130331252| location = New Jersey | publisher = Prentice Hall }}&#60;/ref&#62; each leaflet up to {{convert|8|cm|in|0|sp=us|abbr=on}} long, with a serrated margin; both the stem and leaves are densely glandular-hairy.</p>

The flowers are {{convert|1|-|2|cm|in|1|sp=us|abbr=on}} across, yellow, with five pointed lobes on the <a href="/Catacorolla" title="Catacorolla">corolla</a>; they are borne in a <a href="/Cyme_(botany)" title="Cyme (botany)">cyme</a> of three to 12 together.</p>
<p>Tomato fruit is classified as a <a href="/Berry_(botany)" title="Berry (botany)">berry</a>. As a true fruit, it develops from the ovary of the plant after fertilization, its flesh comprising the pericarp walls. The fruit contains hollow spaces full of seeds and moisture, called locular cavities. These vary, among cultivated species, according to type. Some smaller varieties have two cavities, globe-shaped varieties typically have three to five, beefsteak tomatoes have a great number of smaller cavities, while paste tomatoes have very few, very small cavities.</p>
<p>For propagation, the seeds need to come from a mature fruit, and be dried or fermented before germination.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Breeding">Breeding</span></h2>
<p>Active breeding programs are ongoing by individuals, universities, corporations, and organizations. The Tomato Genetic Resource Center, <a href="/Germplasm_Resources_Information_Network" title="Germplasm Resources Information Network">Germplasm Resources Information Network</a>, <a href="/World_Vegetable_Center" title="World Vegetable Center">AVRDC</a>, and numerous <a href="/Seedbank" title="Seedbank">seed banks</a> around the world store seed representing genetic variations of value to modern agriculture. These seed stocks are available for legitimate breeding and research efforts. While individual breeding efforts can produce useful results, the bulk of tomato breeding work is at universities and major agriculture-related corporations. These efforts have resulted in significant regionally adapted breeding lines and hybrids, such as the Mountain series from North Carolina. Corporations including <a href="/H._J._Heinz_Company" title="H. J. Heinz Company">Heinz</a>, <a href="/Monsanto" title="Monsanto">Monsanto</a>, BHNSeed, Bejoseed, etc., have breeding programs that attempt to improve production, size, shape, color, flavor, disease tolerance, pest tolerance, nutritional value, and numerous other traits.</p>

<p><a href="/Fruit#Botanic_fruit_and_culinary_fruit" title="Fruit">Botanically</a>, a tomato is a <a href="/Fruit" title="Fruit">fruit</a>: the <a href="/Ovary_(plants)" title="Ovary (plants)">ovary</a>, together with its seeds, of a <a href="/Flowering_plant" title="Flowering plant">flowering plant</a>.

One exception is that tomatoes are treated as a fruit in home canning practices: they are acidic enough to process in a water bath rather than a pressure cooker as vegetables require.

<p>This dispute has led to legal speculation in the United States. In 1887, U.S. <a href="/Tariff" title="Tariff">tariff</a> laws that imposed a <a href="/Duty_(economics)" title="Duty (economics)">duty</a> on vegetables, but not on fruits, caused the tomato&#39;s status to become a matter of legal importance. The <a href="/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States" title="Supreme Court of the United States">U.S. Supreme Court</a> settled this controversy on 10 May 1893, by declaring that the tomato is a vegetable, based on the popular definition that classifies vegetables by use, that they are generally served with dinner and not dessert (<i><a href="/Nix_v._Hedden" title="Nix v. Hedden">Nix v.

The holding of this case applies only to the interpretation of the <a href="/Tariff_of_1883" title="Tariff of 1883">Tariff Act of 3 March 1883</a>, and the court did not purport to reclassify the tomato for botanical or other purposes.</p>
