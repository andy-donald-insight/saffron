The curds are processed differently depending on the form of tofu that is being manufactured.  For soft silken tofu ({{lang|zh|<a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%AB%A9">嫩</a><a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E8%B1%86">豆</a><a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E8%85%90">腐</a>}}; <i>nèn dòufu</i>) or tofu flower ({{lang|zh|<a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E8%B1%86">豆</a><a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E8%8A%B1">花</a>}}, <i>dòuhuā</i>) the soy milk is curdled directly in the tofu&#39;s selling package.  For standard firm Asian tofu, the soy curd is cut and strained of excess liquid using <a href="/Cheese_cloth" title="Cheese cloth">cheese cloth</a> or <a href="/Muslin" title="Muslin">muslin</a> and then lightly pressed to produce a soft cake.  Firmer tofus, such as Asian dry tofu ({{lang|zh|<a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E8%B1%86">豆</a><a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%B9%B2">干</a>}}) or Western types of tofu, are further pressed to remove even more liquid. In Vietnam, the curd is strained and molded in a square mold and the end product is called <i>đậu khuôn</i> (molded bean) or <i>đậu phụ</i> (one of the Vietnamese ways to pronounce the Chinese <i>dòufu</i>).  The tofu curds are allowed to cool and become firm. The finished tofu can then be cut into pieces, flavored or further processed.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}</p>
<p>Although tartness is sometimes desired in dessert tofu, the acid used in flavoring is usually not the primary coagulant since it is not desirable to the flavor or texture of the resulting tofu to add it in a sufficiently high concentration so as to induce coagulation.  A sour taste in tofu and a slight cloudiness in its storing liquid is also usually an indication of bacterial growth and, hence, spoilage.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Varieties">Varieties</span></h2>

<p>There is a wide variety of tofu available in both Western and Eastern markets.  Despite the large variety, tofu products can be split into two main categories: <i>fresh tofu</i>, which is produced directly from <a href="/Soy_milk" title="Soy milk">soy milk</a>, and <i>processed tofu</i>, which is produced from fresh tofu.  Tofu production also creates important side products which are often used in various cuisines.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Fresh_tofu">Fresh tofu</span></h3>

<p>Depending on the amount of water that is extracted from the tofu curds, fresh tofu can be divided into three main varieties. Fresh tofu is usually sold completely immersed in water to maintain its moisture content.

<li><b>Thousand layer tofu</b> (千葉豆腐, 凍豆腐 dòngdòufu or 冰豆腐 bīngdòufu in Chinese, literally &#34;thousand layer tofu&#34; or &#34;frozen tofu&#34;): By freezing tofu, the large ice crystals that develop within the tofu result in the formation of large cavities that appear to be layered.  The frozen tofu takes on a yellowish hue in the freezing process.  Thousand layer tofu is commonly made at home from Asian soft tofu though it is also commercially sold as a specialty in parts of Taiwan.  This tofu is defrosted, and sometimes pressed to remove moisture, prior to use.</li>

<p>Tofu production creates some edible byproducts. Food products are made from the protein-oil film, or &#34;skin,&#34; which forms over the surface of boiling soy milk in an open shallow pan.  The leftover solids from pressing soy milk are called <i><a href="/Okara_(food)" title="Okara (food)">okara</a></i>.</p>

<p><a href="/Tofu_skin" title="Tofu skin">Tofu skin</a> is produced through the boiling of soy milk, in an open shallow pan, thus producing a film or skin composed primarily of a soy protein-lipid complex on the liquid surface.  The films are collected and dried into yellowish sheets known as <b>soy milk skin</b> ({{lang|zh|腐皮}}, <i>fǔpí</i> in Chinese; {{lang|ja|湯葉}}, <i>yuba</i> in Japanese).

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Three_theories_of_origin">Three theories of origin</span></h2>

<p>The most commonly held of the three theories of tofu&#39;s origin maintains that tofu was invented in northern China around 164 BC by Lord <a href="/Liu_An" title="Liu An">Liu An</a>, a <a href="/Han_Dynasty" title="Han Dynasty">Han Dynasty</a> prince.  Although this is possible, the paucity of concrete information about this period makes it difficult to conclusively determine whether Liu An invented the method for making tofu.  Furthermore, in <a href="/Chinese_history" title="Chinese history">Chinese history</a>, important inventions were often attributed to important leaders and figures of the time.&#60;ref name=WilliamAoyagi_1/&#62; In 1960, a stone mural unearthed from an Eastern Han dynasty tomb provided support for the theory of Han origin of tofu, however some scholars maintained that the tofu in Han dynasty was rudimentary, and lacked the firmness and taste of real tofu.&#60;ref&#62;Joseph Needham Science and Civilization in China, vol 6, part 5, chapter 40, pp. 306–307, Cambridge University Press&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>Another theory states that the production method for tofu was discovered accidentally when a slurry of boiled, ground soybeans was mixed with impure <a href="/Sea_salt" title="Sea salt">sea salt</a>.  Such sea salt would probably have contained calcium and magnesium salts, allowing the soy mixture to curdle and produce a tofu-like gel.&#60;ref&#62;Korean <i>sundubu</i> (soft tofu) and Okinawan tofu is still produced in a similar manner, traditionally using seawater as a coagulant.&#60;/ref&#62;  This may have possibly been the way that tofu was discovered, since soy milk has been eaten as a savory soup in ancient as well as modern times.  Its technical plausibility notwithstanding, there is little evidence to prove or disprove that tofu production originated in this way.&#60;ref name=WilliamAoyagi_1 /&#62;</p>
<p>The last group of theories maintains that the ancient Chinese learned the method for the curdling of soy milk by emulating the milk curdling techniques of the <a href="/Mongols" title="Mongols">Mongolians</a> or <a href="/East_India" title="East India">East Indians</a>.  For, despite their advancement, no technology or knowledge of culturing and processing milk products existed within ancient Chinese society. (They did not seek such technology, probably because of the Confucian taboo on fermented dairy products and other so-called &#34;barbarian foodstuffs&#34;.)  The primary evidence for this theory lies with the etymological similarity between the Chinese term for Mongolian fermented milk (<i>rufu</i>, which literally means &#34;milk curdled&#34;) and the term <i>doufu</i> (&#34;beans curdled&#34;) or tofu.  Although intriguing and possible, there is no evidence to substantiate this theory beyond the point of academic speculation.&#60;ref name=WilliamAoyagi_1/&#62;</p>

<p>Tofu originated in ancient <a href="/China" title="China">China</a>,&#60;ref name=Soya&#62;<i><a class="external text" href="http://www.soya.be/history-of-tofu.php" rel="nofollow">History of Tofu</a></i>&#60;/ref&#62; although little else is known about the exact historic origins of tofu and of its method of production.</p>
<p>The theory that tofu was invented by Lord <a href="/Liu_An" title="Liu An">Liu An</a> of Huainan in about 164 BC (early Han dynasty) has steadily lost favor among most scholars in China and abroad since the 1970s. The claim concerning Liu An was first made by <a href="/Zhu_Xi" title="Zhu Xi">Zhu Xi</a> during the <a href="/Song_dynasty" title="Song dynasty">Song dynasty</a> (960-1127 AD) - roughly 1,000 years after the supposed invention.</p>
<p>The theory that tofu-making is shown in a mural incised on a stone slab in Han Tomb No. 1, at Da-hu-ting, Mixian, Henan province attracted much attention after about 1990. Yet it too has lost favor because (1) no step of cooking the soy puree is shown in the mural, and (2) when Chinese food historians tried to make tofu without cooking the puree, the result was a tiny amount of unpalatable material.&#60;ref&#62;Shurtleff &#38; Aoyagi, 2013. History of Tofu and Tofu Products...&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>Thus, while there are many theories regarding tofu&#39;s origins, historical information is scarce enough as to relegate the status of most theories to either speculation or legend.  Like the origins of <a href="/Cheese" title="Cheese">cheese</a> and <a href="/Butter" title="Butter">butter</a>, the exact origin of tofu production may never be known or proven. The historical era starts in the year 965 AD (early Song dynasty) with the <i>Qing Yilu</i> by Tao Ku.</p>
<p>What is known is that tofu production is an ancient technique. Tofu was widely consumed in ancient <a href="/China" title="China">China</a>,{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} and techniques for its production and preparation were eventually spread to many other parts of <a href="/Asia" title="Asia">Asia</a>.</p>

<p>
Its development likely preceded Liu An, as tofu is known to have been a commonly produced and consumed food item in China by the 2nd century BC.  Although the varieties of tofu produced in ancient times may not have been identical to those of today, descriptions from writings and poetry of the <a href="/Song_Dynasty" title="Song Dynasty">Song</a> and <a href="/Yuan_Dynasty" title="Yuan Dynasty">Yuan Dynasty</a> show that the production technique for tofu had already been standardized by then, to the extent that they would be similar to tofu of contemporary times.</p>
<p>In China, tofu is traditionally used as a food offering when visiting the graves of deceased relatives.  It is claimed that the spirits (or ghosts) have long lost their chins and jaws, and that only tofu is soft enough for them to eat. Before <a href="/Refrigeration" title="Refrigeration">refrigeration</a> was available in China, tofu was often only sold during the winter time, due to the tofu not spoiling in the colder weather.  During the warmer months, any leftover tofu would be spoiled if left for more than a day. Chinese war hero <a href="/Guan_Yu" title="Guan Yu">Guan Yu</a> used to be a tofu maker before he enlisted in the army. Chinese martial arts expert and hero, <a href="/Yim_Wing-chun" title="Yim Wing-chun">Yim Wing-chun</a>, was a celebrated tofu maker in her village.  (Tofu as such plays a part in the 1994 movie about her life, <i><a href="/Wing_Chun_(film)" title="Wing Chun (film)">Wing Chun</a></i>.)</p>
<p>Tofu and its production technique were subsequently introduced into <a href="/Korea" title="Korea">Korea</a> and then <a href="/Japan" title="Japan">Japan</a> in the <a href="/Nara_period" title="Nara period">Nara period</a> (late 8th century) as well as other parts of <a href="/East_Asia" title="East Asia">East Asia</a>. The earliest document of tofu in Japan shows that the dish was served as an offering at the <a href="/Kasuga_Shrine" title="Kasuga Shrine">Kasuga Shrine</a> in <a href="/Nara%2C_Nara" title="Nara, Nara">Nara</a> in 1183.&#60;ref&#62;<i>A taste of Japan</i>, Donald Richie, <a href="/Kodansha" title="Kodansha">Kodansha</a>, 2001, <a class="external text" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/4770017073" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/4770017073">ISBN 4-7700-1707-3</a>&#60;/ref&#62; The book <i><a href="/Tofu_Hyakuchin" title="Tofu Hyakuchin">Tofu Hyakuchin</a></i> ({{lang|ja|豆腐百珍}} Dòufu Bǎizhēn), published in the <a href="/Edo_period" title="Edo period">Edo period</a>, lists 100 recipes for cooking tofu.</p>
<p>The rise in acceptance of tofu likely coincided with that of <a href="/Buddhism" title="Buddhism">Buddhism</a> as it is an important source of proteins in the religion&#39;s vegetarian diet.  Since then, tofu has become a <a href="/Staple_food" title="Staple food">staple</a> in many countries, including <a href="/Vietnam" title="Vietnam">Vietnam</a>, <a href="/Thailand" title="Thailand">Thailand</a>, and <a href="/Korea" title="Korea">Korea</a>, with subtle regional variations in production methods, texture, flavor, and usage.</p>
<p>In Southeast Asia, tofu was introduced to the region by Chinese immigrants from sea-faring Fujian province, evident from the fact that many countries in Southeast Asia refer to tofu by the <a href="/Min_Nan" title="Min Nan">Min Nan</a> Chinese pronunciations for either soft and firm tofu, or &#34;tāu-hū&#34; and &#34;tāu-goan&#34; respectively. In <a href="/Indonesia" title="Indonesia">Indonesia</a>, <a href="/Malaysia" title="Malaysia">Malaysia</a>, <a href="/Singapore" title="Singapore">Singapore</a>, <a href="/Thailand" title="Thailand">Thailand</a> and the <a href="/Philippine" title="Philippine">Philippines</a>, tofu is widely available and used in many local dishes. Tofu is called <i>tahu</i> in Indonesia, <a href="/Indonesian_cuisine" title="Indonesian cuisine">Indonesian dishes</a> such as, tahu sumbat, taoge tahu, <a href="/Asinan" title="Asinan">asinan</a>, <a href="/Siomay" title="Siomay">siomay</a> and some curries, are often add slices of tofu as ingredients. In addition, <a href="/Tahu_goreng" title="Tahu goreng">tahu goreng</a>, tahu isi and <a href="/Tahu_sumedang" title="Tahu sumedang">tahu sumedang</a> are the popular fried tofu snacks. Tofu is called <i>tauhu</i> in Malaysia and Singapore. The Malaysian and Singaporean Indians use tofu in their cuisine such as Indian <a href="/Mee_goreng" title="Mee goreng">mee goreng</a>, <a href="/Rojak" title="Rojak">rojak</a> pasembor. The strait <a href="/Peranakan" title="Peranakan">peranakan</a> cuisine often uses tofu, such as mee kari Penang, and <a href="/Laksa" title="Laksa">laksa</a>. The makers of tofu in these countries were originally the Chinese but tofu now is made by non-Chinese as well. Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia and the Philippines are major producers of tofu and have plants located within many municipalities. However, Singapore imports its tofu from its neighboring country, Malaysia.</p>
<p>Tofu in the <a href="/Philippines" title="Philippines">Philippines</a> is essential to the daily diet, as <i><a href="/Taho" title="Taho">taho</a></i>, widely eaten as breakfast, or <i>tokwa</i> (a dry fried variation), which is a staple or alternative to meat in main meals, and in numerous regional dishes. Tofu was introduced to the archipelago in the 10th to 13th centuries by <a href="/Song_dynasty" title="Song dynasty">Song</a> Chinese mariners and merchants, along with many different foods which had become staples of the Philippine diet. The use and production of Tofu were first limited to urban centers with influential Chinese minorities, such as <a href="/Cebu_City" title="Cebu City">Cebu</a> or <a href="/Kingdom_of_Tondo" title="Kingdom of Tondo">Tondo</a>, but were quickly spread to even remote native villages and islands, long before the Spanish arrival in the 17th century.</p>

With increased cultural contact between the West and East Asia and growing interest in vegetarianism, knowledge of tofu has become widespread. Numerous types of pre-flavored tofu can be found in many supermarket chains throughout the West. It is also used by many vegans and vegetarians as a means to gain protein without the consumption of meat products.</p>
