<p>The most common type of turnip is mostly white-skinned apart from the upper 1–6 centimeters, which protrude above the ground and are purple, red, or greenish wherever sunlight has fallen. This above-ground part develops from stem tissue, but is fused with the root. The interior flesh is entirely white. The entire root is roughly  globular, about 5–20 centimeters in diameter, and lacks side roots. The <a href="/Taproot" title="Taproot">taproot</a> (the normal root below the swollen storage root) is thin and 10 centimeters or more in length; it is trimmed off before marketing. The leaves grow directly from the above-ground shoulder of the root, with little or no visible crown or neck (as found in <a href="/Rutabaga" title="Rutabaga">rutabagas</a>).{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}</p>
<p>Turnip <a href="/Spring_greens" title="Spring greens">leaves</a> are sometimes eaten as &#34;turnip greens&#34; (&#34;turnip tops&#34; in the UK), and they resemble <a href="/Brassica_juncea" title="Brassica juncea">mustard greens</a> in flavor. Turnip greens are a common side dish in southeastern U.S. cooking, primarily during late fall and winter. Smaller leaves are preferred; however, any bitter taste of larger leaves can be reduced by pouring off the water from initial boiling and replacing it with fresh water. Varieties specifically grown for the leaves resemble mustard greens more than those grown for the roots, with small or no storage roots.  Varieties of <i>B. rapa</i> that have been developed only for the use of leaves are called <a href="/Chinese_cabbage" title="Chinese cabbage">Chinese cabbage</a>. Both leaves and root have a pungent flavor similar to raw <a href="/Cabbage" title="Cabbage">cabbage</a> or <a href="/Radish" title="Radish">radishes</a> that becomes mild after cooking.</p>
<p>Turnip roots weigh up to about one kilogram, although they can be harvested when smaller. Size is partly a function of variety and partly a function of the length of time the turnip has grown. Most very small turnips (also called <b>baby turnips</b>) are specialty varieties. These are only available when freshly harvested and do not keep well. Most baby turnips can be eaten whole, including their leaves. Baby turnips come in yellow-, orange-, and red-fleshed varieties as well as white-fleshed. Their flavor is mild, so they can be eaten raw in <a href="/Salad" title="Salad">salads</a> like <a href="/Radish" title="Radish">radishes</a> and other vegetables.</p>

<p>Like <a href="/Rutabaga" title="Rutabaga">rutabaga</a>, turnip contains bitter cyanoglucosides that release small amounts of <a href="/Cyanide" title="Cyanide">cyanide</a>. Sensitivity to the bitterness of these cyanoglucosides is controlled by a paired gene. Subjects who have inherited two copies of the &#34;sensitive&#34; gene find turnips twice as bitter as those who have two &#34;insensitive&#34; genes, and thus may find turnips and other cyanoglucoside-containing foods intolerably bitter.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Origin">Origin</span></h2>
<p>There is evidence that the turnip was domesticated before the 15th century BC; it was grown in India at this time for its oil-bearing seeds.&#60;!-- In northern <a href="/India" title="India">India</a>, in <a href="/Hindi" title="Hindi">Hindi</a> language, it is called <i>Shalgam (शल्गम)</i> and used for preparing vegetable.--&#62;&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|title=Turnip – Brassica Rapa|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.selfsufficientish.com/turnip.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.selfsufficientish.com/turnip.htm</a>|publisher=Self Sufficientish|accessdate=14 January 2013}}&#60;/ref&#62; The turnip was a well-established crop in <a href="/Hellenistic" title="Hellenistic">Hellenistic</a> and <a href="/Roman_Empire" title="Roman Empire">Roman</a> times, which leads to the assumption that it was brought into cultivation earlier. <a href="/Sappho" title="Sappho">Sappho</a>, a Greek poet from the 7th century BC, calls one of her paramours <i>Gongýla</i>, &#34;turnip&#34;.  Zohary and Hopf note, however, &#34;there are almost no archaeological records available&#34; to help determine its earlier history and domestication. Wild forms of the hot turnip and its relatives the <a href="/Mustard_plant" title="Mustard plant">mustards</a> and <a href="/Radish" title="Radish">radishes</a> are found over west <a href="/Asia" title="Asia">Asia</a> and <a href="/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a>, suggesting their domestication took place somewhere in that area.

{{quotation | The benefits derived from turnip husbandry are of great magnitude; light soils are cultivated with profit and facility; abundance of food is provided for man and beast; the earth is turned to the uses for which it is physically calculated, and by being suitably cleaned with this preparatory crop, a bed is provided for grass seeds, wherein they flourish and prosper with greater vigor than after any other preparation.</p>
<p>The first ploughing is given immediately after harvest, or as soon as the wheat seed is finished, either in length or across the field, as circumstances may seem to require. In this state the ground remains till the oat seed is finished, when a second ploughing is given to it, usually in a contrary direction to the first. It is then repeatedly <a href="/Harrow_(tool)" title="Harrow (tool)">harrowed</a>, often rolled between the harrowings and every particle of root-weeds carefully picked off with the hand; a third ploughing is then bestowed, and the other operations are repeated. In this stage, if the ground has not been very foul, the seed process.</p>
<p>The next part of the process is the sowing of the seed; this may be performed by drilling machines of different sizes and constructions, through all acting on the same principle. A machine drawn by a horse in a pair of shafts, sows two drills at a time and answers extremely well, where the ground is flat, and the drills properly made up. The weight of the machine ensures a regularity of sowing hardly to be gained by those of a different size and construction. From two to three pounds of seed are sown upon the acre (2 to 3&#38;nbsp;kg/hectare), though the smallest of these quantities will give many more plants in ordinary seasons than are necessary; but as the seed is not an expensive article the greater part of farmers incline to sow thick, which both provides against the danger of part of the seed perishing, and gives the young plants an advantage at the outset.</p>
<p>Turnips are sown from the beginning to the end of June, but the second and third weeks of the month are, by judicious farmers, accounted the most proper time. Some people have sown as early as May, and with advantage, but these early fields are apt to run to seed before winter, especially if the autumn be favorable to vegetation. As a general rule it may be laid down that the earliest sowings should be on the latest soils; plants on such soils are often long before they make any great progress, and, in the end, may be far behind those in other situations, which were much later sown. The hot turnip plant, indeed, does not thrive rapidly till its roots reach the dung, and the previous nourishment afforded them is often so scanty as to stunt them altogether before they get so far.</p>
<p>The first thing to be done in this process is to run a horse-hoe, called a scraper, along the intervals, keeping at such a distance from the young plants that they shall not be injured; this operation destroys all the annual weeds which have sprung up, and leaves the plants standing in regular stripes or rows. The hand hoeing then commences, by which the turnips are all singled out at a distance of from 8–12&#38;nbsp;inches, and the redundant ones drawn into the spaces between the rows. The singling out of the young plants is an operation of great importance, for an error committed in this process can hardly be afterward rectified. Boys and girls are always employed as hoers; but a steady and trusty man-servant is usually set over them to see that the work is properly executed.</p>
<p>In eight or ten days, or such a length of time as circumstances may require, a horse-hoe of a different construction from the scraper is used. This, in fact, is generally a small plough, of the same kind with that commonly wrought, but of smaller dimensions. By this implement, the earth is pared away from the sides of the drills, and a sort of new ridge formed in the middle of the former interval. The hand-hoers are again set to work, and every weed and superfluous turnip is cut up; afterward the horse-hoe is employed to separate the earth, which it formerly threw into the furrows, and lay it back to the sides of the drills. On dry lands this is done by the scraper, but where the least tendency to moisture prevails, the small plough is used, in order that the furrows may be perfectly cleaned out. This latter mode, indeed, is very generally practiced. }}</p>
<p>As a root crop, turnips grow best in cool weather; hot temperatures cause the roots to become woody and bad-tasting. They are typically planted in the spring in cold-weather climates (such as the northern US and Canada) where the growing season is only 3–4 months. In temperate climates (ones with a growing season of 5–6 months), turnips may also be planted in late summer for a second fall crop. In warm-weather climates (7 or more month growing season), they are planted in the fall. 55–60 days is the average time from planting to harvest.</p>
<p>Turnips are a biennial plant, taking two years from germination to reproduction. The root spends the first year growing and storing nutrients, and the second year flowers, produces seeds, and dies. The flowers of the turnip are tall and yellow, with the seeds forming in pea-like pods. In areas with less than 7-month growing seasons, temperatures are too cold for the roots to survive the winter months. In order to produce seeds, it is necessary to pull the turnip and store it overwinter, taking care not to damage the leaves. During the spring, it may be set back in the ground to complete its life cycle.</p>
