<p><b>Sushki</b> ({{lang-rus|су́шки|p=ˈsuʂkʲɪ}}, plural; {{lang-rus|су́шка|p=ˈsuʂkʌ}}, singular) is a traditional Russian tea bread. It is a small, crunchy, mildly sweet bread ring which can be eaten for dessert. Similar breads are: <a href="/Bagel" title="Bagel">bagels</a>, <a href="/Bublik" title="Bublik">bubliki</a> and baranki. Pre-packaged sushki can be found in markets that sell Russian foods. They are sometimes topped with poppy seeds.</p>
<p>Typical ingredients are <a href="/Flour" title="Flour">flour</a>, <a href="/Egg_(food)" title="Egg (food)">eggs</a>, water, and salt, which are combined into a firm dough. This is then cut and rolled into thin strips of about half a centimetre thickness which are formed into rings, briefly cooked in boiling sugar water, then baked in an oven.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.cooking-book.ru/recepts/bake/bublik/11898.shtml" rel="nofollow">Bublik and Sushki recipes (in Russian)</a>&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
