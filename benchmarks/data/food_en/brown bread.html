<p>New England or Boston brown bread is a type of dark, slightly sweet <a href="/Steamed_bread" title="Steamed bread">steamed bread</a> (usually a <a href="/Quick_bread" title="Quick bread">quick bread</a>) popular in <a href="/New_England" title="New England">New England</a>. It is cooked by steam in a can, or cylindrical pan.</p>
<p>Boston brown bread&#39;s colour comes from a mixture of flours, usually a mix of several of the following: <a href="/Cornmeal" title="Cornmeal">cornmeal</a>, rye, whole wheat, <a href="/Graham_flour" title="Graham flour">graham flour</a>, and from the addition of sweeteners like <a href="/Molasses" title="Molasses">molasses</a> and <a href="/Maple_syrup" title="Maple syrup">maple syrup</a>. Leavening most often comes from baking soda (<a href="/Sodium_bicarbonate" title="Sodium bicarbonate">sodium bicarbonate</a>) though a few recipes use yeast. <a href="/Raisin" title="Raisin">Raisins</a> are often added. The batter is poured into a can, and steamed in a kettle. While most variations are quick breads, and can be made in less than an hour, several commercial brands are available. Brown bread is somewhat seasonal, being served mostly in fall and winter, and is frequently served with <a href="/Baked_beans" title="Baked beans">baked beans</a>.</p>
<p>Brown bread is closely related to an earlier bread known as &#34;Rye n Injun&#34; (from &#34;<a href="/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas" title="Indigenous peoples of the Americas">Indian</a>&#34; cornmeal) or &#34;thirded&#34; bread from its use of rye, cornmeal and wheat flours. Unlike modern Boston brown bread, thirded bread is generally <a href="/Yeast" title="Yeast">yeast</a>-raised and baked rather than steamed.</p>
