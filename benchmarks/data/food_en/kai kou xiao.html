<p>The traditional culinary method of this dish begins with the preparation of <a href="/Flour" title="Flour">flour</a>, <a href="/Peanut_oil" title="Peanut oil">peanut oil</a>, <a href="/Egg_(food)" title="Egg (food)">egg</a>, <a href="/Sugar" title="Sugar">sugar</a>, <a href="/Maltose" title="Maltose">malt sugar</a>, <a href="/Sesame_seed" title="Sesame seed">sesame seeds</a> and <a href="/Baking_soda" title="Baking soda">baking soda</a>. With the exception of the sesame seeds, everything else is mixed together, and the resulting dough is cut into pieces. The sesame seeds are boiled in water and each small piece of dough is rolled in the sesame seeds. The end result is then fried on a <a href="/Skillet" title="Skillet">skillet</a>. The chef must lift the frying pan off the stove and put it back on depending on the situation. The resulting opening crack is where the literal name in Chinese comes from, as it resembles a happy smiling mouth.</p>
