<p>A Christmas cake may be light or dark, crumbly-moist to sticky-wet, spongy to heavy, leavened or unleavened,{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} shaped round, square or oblong as whole cakes, <a href="/Cupcake" title="Cupcake">cupcake</a>, or <a href="/Petit_fours" title="Petit fours">petit fours</a>, with <a href="/Marzipan" title="Marzipan">marzipan</a>, <a href="/Icing_(food)" title="Icing (food)">icing</a>, glazing, dusting with <a href="/Icing_sugar" title="Icing sugar">icing sugar</a>, or plain. If a Christmas cake is covered in icing, it is quite common for it to be decorated - models of houses, of fir trees or of <a href="/Santa_Claus" title="Santa Claus">Santa Claus</a> may be in the array of decorations.</p>
<p>A particular favourite of many is the traditional <a href="/Scotland" title="Scotland">Scottish</a> Christmas cake, the <a href="/Dundee_cake" title="Dundee cake">Whisky Dundee</a>. As the name implies, the cake originated in <a href="/Dundee%2C_Scotland" title="Dundee, Scotland">Dundee</a> and is made with <a href="/Scotch_whisky" title="Scotch whisky">Scotch whisky</a>. It is a light and crumbly cake, and light on fruit and candied peel—only <a href="/Zante_currant" title="Zante currant">currants</a>, <a href="/Raisin" title="Raisin">raisins</a>, <a href="/Sultana_(grape)" title="Sultana (grape)">sultanas</a>  and <a href="/Cherry" title="Cherry">cherries</a>. This Christmas cake is particularly good for people who don&#39;t like very rich and moist cakes.</p>
<p>In the middle of the spectrum is the <a href="/Mincemeat" title="Mincemeat">mincemeat</a> Christmas cake, which is any traditional or vegetarian mincemeat, mixed with flour, eggs, etc., to transform it into a cake batter;{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}{{dubious|date=December 2013}} or it can also be steamed as a <a href="/Christmas_pudding" title="Christmas pudding">Christmas pudding</a>.</p>
<p>Coins were also occasionally added to Christmas cakes as well as Christmas puddings as good luck <a href="/Touch_piece" title="Touch piece">touch pieces</a>. The usual choices were silver <a href="/History_of_the_threepence" title="History of the threepence">3d piece</a>, or <a href="/Sixpence_(British_coin)" title="Sixpence (British coin)">sixpences</a>, sometimes wrapped in greaseproof paper packages.</p>
<p>In <a href="/Yorkshire" title="Yorkshire">Yorkshire</a>, Christmas cake, as with other types of fruit cake, can be eaten with cheese, such as <a href="/Wensleydale_(cheese)" title="Wensleydale (cheese)">Wensleydale</a>.</p>
<p>A cake that may also be served at Christmas time in the United Kingdom, in addition to the traditional Christmas cake, is the cake known as  a &#34;chocolate log&#34;. This is a <a href="/Swiss_roll" title="Swiss roll">Swiss roll</a> that is coated in chocolate, resembling a log.</p>

<p>In <a href="/India" title="India">India</a>, Christmas cakes are traditionally a fruit cake with many variants. <a href="/Allahabadi_cake" title="Allahabadi cake">Allahabadi cake</a> is famous for its rich taste and texture.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite news| url=<a class="external free" href="http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-12-15/deep-focus/45215736_1_cake-bakery-khari-baoli" rel="nofollow">http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-12-15/deep-focus/45215736_1_cake-bakery-khari-baoli</a> | work=The Times Of India | title=Cakewalk in Allahabad - The Times of India | date=December 15, 2013}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>

<p>In the <a href="/Philippines" title="Philippines">Philippines</a>, Christmas cakes are bright rich yellow pound cakes with macerated nuts or fruitcakes of the British fashion.  Both are soaked in copious amounts of brandy or rum mixed with a simple syrup of <a href="/Palm_sugar" title="Palm sugar">palm sugar</a> and water.  Traditionally, <a href="/Civet" title="Civet">civet</a> musk is added, but rosewater or orange flower water is more common now, as civet musk has become very expensive.
