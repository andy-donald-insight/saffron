At this time in Vienna there was introduced by the bakers a roll made with a finer quality of flour by the process of sweet fermentation, (that is, with yeast,) which was called the imperial roll, (Kaiser-Semmel.) From this time to 1840, nothing new appeared, though there was constant demand for the sweet fermented rolls....}}&#60;/ref&#62; These sweet-fermented rolls lacked the acid sourness typical of <a href="/Lactobacillus#Food_production" title="Lactobacillus">lactobacillus</a>, and were said to be popular and in high demand.</p>
<p>Prior to this time, bakers had been using old-dough leavens, and they had discovered that accelerating the latter <a href="/Sourdough#Refreshment_of_the_starter" title="Sourdough">refreshments</a>&#39; rest intervals promoted yeast growth in a race against time and what would later be learned were overwhelming lactobacillus numbers.

A lump of dough remaining from the last batch of bread, and consisting of 8 lbs. flour and 4 Ibs. water, is left to itself for ten hours: in this state it is called fresh leaven (levain de chef). By kneading this with another quantity of 8 lbs. flour and 4 lbs. water, the once-revived leaven (levain de premiere) is obtained. After another interval of eight hours, 16 lbs. of flour and 8 lbs. water are added, forming the twice-revived leaven (levain de seconde); and after three hours more, 100 Ibs. flour and 52 Ibs. water containing ¼ to ⅓ lb. beer-yeast are added, forming the finished leaven (levain de taut point). The 200 lbs. leaven thus obtained are mixed, after two hours, with 132 lbs. flour and 68 lbs. water, containing ½ lb. of yeast in suspension and 2 lbs. common salt dissolved. This quantity of dough serves for five or six bakings. For the first baking, half the dough (200 lbs.) is made into loaves of the required size and form, which are exposed for a while in shallow baskets, to a temperature of 25° C. (77° F.), and then transferred to the oven. The bread thus obtained has a sourish taste and dark colour. The remaining half of the dough is again mixed with 132Ibs. flour, 70lbs. water, ½ lb. yeast, and the requisite quantity of salt; the half of this quantity of dough is then formed into loaves, left to ferment, and baked. The same operations are repeated three times, one-half of the dough being each time mixed with 130 Ibs. flour, 1⅓ lb. yeast, and the proper quantity of water and salt. The last stage yields the finest and whitest bread. }}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>

At length, a prize was offered in 1845 by the Association of Vienna Bakers, (an association which has kept its records from the year 1452 down,) for the independent production of a good yeast, and the trades-union recognizing the importance of the object, offered to the discoverer the loan of its great gold medal. The offer of these prizes met with success in 1847. Adolf Ignaz Mautner, succeeded in producing the desired article, and in 1850 the prize and the medal were awarded for the production of his cereal press-yeast. From this point on, the baking-industry made rapid development throughout the Austrian empire, and at the Paris Exposition in 1867 the Vienna bakery was recognized as the first in the world. Vienna may therefore properly claim the double honor of having been the seat of the first development of the art of high milling and the birthplace of the use of press-yeast.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Hungarian_high_milling">Hungarian high milling</span></h2>

<p>Hungarian high milling used a hard or tenacious variety of Hungarian wheat. Their mills were outfitted with both stone and steel-roller mills, and were using a new process that was undoubtedly at the forefront of the technology of the day. This time period marked a changeover from one-pass stone grinding or <i>low milling</i> with its higher damaged starch content, to that of roller milling with greater speed, efficiency, and cooler-temperature operation.</p>

One also remarks relatively very few broken or bruised starch-grains in the high-milled flour, while the reverse is true of the low-milled flour.}}</p>
<p>The origins of high milling appeared to be Austria. Horsford attributed the phrase <i>high milling</i> to <a href="/Semolina" title="Semolina">Vienna grits</a> or <a href="//de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grie%C3%9F"><i>Grieß</i></a>,&#60;ref&#62;{{cite book |url=<a class="external free" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=6jRDAAAAIAAJ&#38;pg=PA49" rel="nofollow">http://books.google.com/books?id=6jRDAAAAIAAJ&#38;pg=PA49</a> |title=Report on Vienna bread |author=Eben Norton Horsford |pages=49–50 |location=Washington|publisher=Government Printing Office |year=1875 |quote=111. The Purification Of The Grits.—The separation of the grits from the bran-scales of equal size is so distinctly of Austrian or Hungarian origin, and so essential to the production of the high grades of flour from which the excellent Vienna bread is produced, as to justify the attempt to present an outline of some of the principal devices by which this separation is effected. These products differ from each other in essential particulars. The bran is the shell of the wheat. The grits are fragments from the interior.}}&#60;/ref&#62; and which were claimed to be on sale in Berlin as early as 1810.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite book |url=<a class="external free" href="http://books.google.com/books?pg=PA31" rel="nofollow">http://books.google.com/books?pg=PA31</a> |title=Report on Vienna bread |author=Eben Norton Horsford |pages=31–32 |location=Washington|publisher=Government Printing Office |year=1875}}&#60;/ref&#62; The recognized pioneer was a miller named Ignaz Paur (1778&#38;ndash;1842) who by 1810 had moved to Leobersdorf. The demand for these grits was so great, hand sifting them was inadequate, so Paur employed the services of a cabinet maker named Winter to build the first <a href="/Middlings_purifier" title="Middlings purifier">middlings purifier</a>. Paur milled already-separated grits a second time, first making an <i>extract flour</i> locally known as <i>Auszug</i>. Over the course of several decades, these high-milling techniques spread to Hungary, Saxony, and Bohemia, among other areas. In Hungary, the steel cylinder or roller mill, locally known as the <i>Walzenmühle</i>, was first invented, and later improved. The Walz sets kept the grain cooler over multiple passes, as successive pairs of rollers were adjusted to incrementally smaller spacings, the grain moved through cooling air from one pair to the next, each cracked them pass-by-pass into smaller successive bits, instead of crushed between stones in one heat-generating pass.</p>
<p>At the Pesth Walzenmühle, when wheat had been fully transformed to flour, it had passed through 18-to-24 pairs of rollers. This new <i>cold milling</i> process, particularly well suited for hard wheat, likely resulted in lighter, more airy breads of greater baked volumes.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite journal |journal=Europoean Food Research and Technology |volume=225 |number=1 |year=2007 |DOI=10.1007/s00217-006-0374-1 |url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.aseanfood.info/Articles/11024011.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.aseanfood.info/Articles/11024011.pdf</a> |title=Inﬂuence of damaged starch on cookie and bread-making quality |author1=Gabriela N.

<p>The dough is placed into the <a href="/Oven" title="Oven">oven</a> under a ceiling of steam or, alternatively, the oven is injected with steam as soon as the loaf is loaded.

Vienna bread is typically formed as an oblong loaf, but can be baked in other shapes.  As a longer loaf, it may well have been the origin of French bread as bakers there attempted to adopt the steam method to produce their <a href="/Baguette" title="Baguette">baguettes</a>.</p>
