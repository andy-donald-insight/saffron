Coal mining has been in operation in Malangas since the early 1930s, which strengthens the local economy as well as that of the entire province Zamboanga Sibugay. In 1938, the <a href="/Malangas_Coal_Reservation" title="Malangas Coal Reservation">Malangas Coal Reservation</a> was established.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|title=Republic Act No. 9134: An Act Reclassifying as Agricultural Land Open to Disposition under the Provisions of the Public Land Act, as Amended, a Portion of the Land Embraced in Proclamation No. 223, Dated February 29, 1988 which was excluded from the Operation of Proclamation No. 284, Dated July 19, 1938, Establishing the Malangas Coal Reservation in the Municipality of Malangas, Province of Zamboanga Del Sur, Island of Mindanao.|url=<a class="external free" href="http://laws.chanrobles.com/republicacts/92_republicacts.php?id=8994" rel="nofollow">http://laws.chanrobles.com/republicacts/92_republicacts.php?id=8994</a>|website=Philippine Laws, Statues and Codes|publisher=Chan Robles Virtual Law Library|accessdate=6 August 2014}}&#60;/ref&#62; Although the scale of the present operations is relatively modest, the production is of considerable national significance. There are relatively large deposits of coal and this estimates to contain nearly 10 million tons of coal (according to Frederick L. Wernstedt,Joseph Earle Spencer) some of which is of coking quality - a small quantity to be sure, but one that gains added significance in light of the general overall shortage of mineral fuels in the Philippines. The present production of Malangas coal is being shipped to the Iligan Industrial area.</p>
<p>The rest of Malangas is still heavily dependent on agriculture and aquaculture, while in the coastal areas there is also commercial fishing.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Coal_mining">Coal mining</span></h3>

<p>There are Philippine coals which are of such quality that they can be used by current users without the need for any coal preparation or blending with imported coals. Among these are the coal deposits being mined in Malangas. The PNOC (<a href="/Philippine_National_Oil_Company" title="Philippine National Oil Company">Philippine National Oil Company</a>) and the TMC its <a href="/Taiwan" title="Taiwan">Taiwanese</a> partner operates coal within the Malangas Coal Reservation. It also operates a large-scale coal mine known as the Integrated Little Baguio (ILB) colliery, which is currently the largest semi-mechanized underground coal mine in the country.</p>
<p>In the year 1995, a worst tragedy happened when a huge methane gas explosion ripped through a coal mine tunnel in Malangas town, killing more than 100 people. The blast set off a fireball, which swept through nine kilometers of mines, and setting off other explosives which had been stockpiled inside the tunnel. Ten years later, six miners were killed when a coal tunnel collapsed in Diplahan town.</p>
<p>News about the coal mine in Malangas has been rumored that PNOC-EC may sell mine to San Miguel Corp.
According to the news, the <a href="/Philippine_National_Oil_Company" title="Philippine National Oil Company">Philippine National Oil Company</a> - Exploration Corp. (PNOC-EC) is in talks with diversified conglomerate San Miguel Corp. to sell a coal mine in Mindanao and this is probably in Zamboanga Peninsula where Malangas is located. For 2009, total coal production in Malangas amounted to 91,440 metric tons, a decrease from the 2008 output of 110, 549 metric tons due to major repair and rehabilitation “conducted immediately upon takeover of the mines.” Today, Mining operators are still operating in the coal reservation of the town.</p>

<p>Malangas is endowed with several islets that are ideal for resort development. One of these is Isla Muyong, comparable to Pandilusan Island in the municipality of Payao and Litayon Island in the municipality of Alicia. One characteristic that they have in common is their white sand beaches. Others are also sprawled in some of the town&#39;s coastline.</p>
<p>The most notable beach in Malangas is the Municipal Government owned beach resort, located in Bunker, the site of the town&#39;s coal port. Many people who live in the nearby towns like it because of the proximity of the place.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Local_government">Local government</span></h2>
<p>The local council is administered by the mayor, with the assistance of the vice-mayor. There is only one representative Sangguniang Kabataan (Youth Council) and Association of Barangay Captains (ABC).</p>
<p>Malangas has been administered by elected and appointed officials since July 23, 1951, with a strong Mayor-council government. The current mayor is governed by Alfredo A. Atilano, the first male elected mayor in the 21st century in the history of Malangas. The Municipal mayor is restricted to three consecutive terms, totaling nine years, although a mayor can be elected again after an interruption of one term. Marcelo Baquial Jr. is the municipal&#39;s incumbent vice-mayor. The vice-mayor heads the legislative arm composed of the elected Municipal councilors.&#60;ref name=comelec/&#62;</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Water_Supply">Water Supply</span></h3>
<p>One of the major problems in Malangas is the water system. Water resources are also less abundant. Almost 90 percent of the population get its water supply from a nearby barangay. But this is not abundant for the population. This explains the water scarcity in the area. While some barangays receive enough water, others experience constant water deficiency most especially in the poblacion area. Lack of access to water is a larger problem in the population anywhere else in the town center. The water supply only runs hourly within the different districts/purok. There are recent government efforts to improve the management of water resources in Malangas but all had failed. As of now, the government is trying to solve the problem to help get the people a good and fine water system.</p>
