<p>As dripping is left over from cooking a joint of meat, it is economical and filling, and has long been a popular snack with schoolboys.&#60;ref&#62;Hughes, Thomas: <i><a href="/Tom_Brown&#39;s_Schooldays" title="Tom Brown&#39;s Schooldays">Tom Brown&#39;s Schooldays</a></i>, 1857: &#34;<i>...Tom, by a sort of instinct, knew the right cupboards in the kitchen and pantry, and soon managed to place on the snuggery table better materials for a meal than had appeared there probably during the reign of his tutor, who was then and there initiated, amongst other things, into the excellence of that mysterious condiment, a <b>dripping-cake</b>. The cake was newly baked, and all rich and flaky; Tom had found it reposing in the cook&#39;s private cupboard, awaiting her return; and as a warning to her they finished it to the last crumb.</i>&#34;&#60;/ref&#62;
