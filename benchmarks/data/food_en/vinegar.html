BIOCHEMICAL STUDIES ON ETHANOL OXIDATION|work=oxfordjournals.org}}&#60;/ref&#62; Vinegar is now mainly used as a cooking ingredient. Historically, as the most easily available mild <a href="/Acid" title="Acid">acid</a>, it had a great variety of industrial, medical and domestic uses, some of which (such as its use as a general household cleanser) are still promoted today.</p>
<p>Commercial vinegar is produced either by fast or slow fermentation processes. In general, slow methods are used with traditional vinegars, and fermentation proceeds slowly over the course of months or a year. The longer fermentation period allows for the accumulation of a nontoxic slime composed of acetic acid bacteria.  Fast methods add mother of vinegar (<a href="/Bacterial_culture" title="Bacterial culture">bacterial culture</a>) to the source liquid before adding air to oxygenate and promote the fastest fermentation. In fast production processes, vinegar may be produced in 20 hours to three days.</p>

<p>{{Main|Traditional Balsamic Vinegar|Balsamic vinegar}}
Balsamic vinegar is an aromatic aged vinegar produced in the <a href="/Modena" title="Modena">Modena</a> and <a href="/Reggio_Emilia" title="Reggio Emilia">Reggio Emilia</a> provinces of Italy.  The original product{{emdash}}Traditional Balsamic Vinegar{{emdash}}is made from the concentrated juice, or must, of white <a href="/Trebbiano" title="Trebbiano">Trebbiano</a> grapes. It is very dark brown, rich, sweet, and complex, with the finest grades being aged in successive casks made variously of oak, mulberry, chestnut, cherry, juniper and ash wood. Originally a costly product available to only the Italian upper classes, traditional balsamic vinegar is marked &#34;tradizionale&#34; or &#34;DOC&#34; to denote its <a href="/Protected_Designation_of_Origin#Protected_designation_of_origin" title="Protected Designation of Origin">Protected Designation of Origin</a> status, and is aged for 12 to 25 years. A cheaper non-DOC commercial form described as &#34;aceto balsamico di Modena&#34; (balsamic vinegar of Modena)&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/glossary/balsamic-vinegar" rel="nofollow">http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/glossary/balsamic-vinegar</a>|title=Balsamic vinegar|work=BBC Good Food}}&#60;/ref&#62; became widely known and available around the world in the late 20th century, typically made with concentrated grape juice mixed with a strong vinegar, then coloured and slightly sweetened with caramel and sugar.</p>
<p>Regardless of how it is produced, balsamic vinegar must be made from a grape product. It contains no balsam fruit. A high acidity level is somewhat hidden by the sweetness of the other ingredients, making it very mellow.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Beer">Beer</span></h3>
<p>Vinegar made from beer is produced in the United Kingdom, Germany, Austria, and the Netherlands. Although its flavor depends on the particular type of beer from which it is made, it is often described as having a malty taste. That produced in <a href="/Bavaria" title="Bavaria">Bavaria</a> is a light golden color with a very sharp and not-overly-complex flavor.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Cane">Cane</span></h3>
<p>Cane vinegar, made from <a href="/Sugarcane_juice" title="Sugarcane juice">sugarcane juice</a>, is most popular in the Philippines, in particular, the <a href="/Ilocos_Region" title="Ilocos Region">Ilocos Region</a> of the northern Philippines (where it is called <i>sukang iloko</i>), although it also is produced in France and the United States. It ranges from dark yellow to golden brown in color, and has a mellow flavor, similar in some respects to rice vinegar, though with a somewhat &#34;fresher&#34; taste. Because it contains no residual sugar, it is no sweeter than any other vinegar. In the Philippines, it often is labeled as <i>sukang maasim</i> (<a href="/Tagalog_language" title="Tagalog language">Tagalog</a> for &#34;sour vinegar&#34;).</p>
<p>Cane vinegars from Ilocos are made in two different ways. One way is to simply place sugar cane juice in large jars and it will become sour by the direct action of bacteria on the sugar. The other way is through fermentation to produce a local wine known as <i>basi</i>. Low-quality <i>basi</i> is then allowed to undergo acetic acid fermentation that converts alcohol into acetic acid. Contaminated <i>basi</i> also becomes vinegar.</p>
<p>A white variation has become quite popular in Brazil in recent years, where it is the cheapest type of vinegar sold. It is now common for other types of vinegar (made from wine, rice and apple cider) to be sold mixed with cane vinegar to lower the cost.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}</p>
<p>Sugarcane sirka is made from sugarcane juice in Punjab, India. During summer, the people put cane juice in earthenware pots with iron nails. The fermentation takes place due to action of wild yeast. The cane juice is converted to vinegar having a blackish color. The sirka is used to preserve pickles and for flavoring curries.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Coconut">Coconut</span></h3>

<p>The term &#34;distilled vinegar&#34; is something of a misnomer, because it is not produced by distillation but by fermentation of distilled alcohol. The fermentate is diluted to produce a colorless solution of 5% to 8% acetic acid in water, with a pH of about 2.4.
