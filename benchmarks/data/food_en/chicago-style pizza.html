<p><b>Chicago-style pizza</b> refers to several different styles of <a href="/Pizza" title="Pizza">pizza</a> developed in <a href="/Chicago" title="Chicago">Chicago</a>. Arguably the most famous of these is known as deep-dish pizza. The pan in which it is baked gives the pizza its characteristically high edge and a deep surface for the large amounts of <a href="/Cheese" title="Cheese">cheese</a> and chunky <a href="/Tomato_sauce" title="Tomato sauce">tomato sauce</a>. Most pizzerias in Chicago also serve thin-crust pizza in a style characteristic to the city, although Chicago-style pizza is most commonly known for the deep-dish style of pizza outside the <a href="/Chicago_metropolitan_area" title="Chicago metropolitan area">Chicago metropolitan area</a>.</p>

<p>According to Tim Samuelson, Chicago&#39;s official cultural historian, there is not enough documentation to determine with certainty who invented Chicago-style deep-dish pizza.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2009-02-18/news/0902180055_1_chicago-pizza-ric-riccardo-pizzeria-uno" rel="nofollow">Chicago Tribune, Who Invented Deep Dish?</a>&#60;/ref&#62; It is often reported that Chicago-style deep-dish pizza was invented at <a href="/Uno_Chicago_Grill" title="Uno Chicago Grill">Pizzeria Uno</a> in Chicago, in 1943,&#60;ref name=autogenerated1&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://members.cox.net/jjschnebel/ddishpiz.html" rel="nofollow">Who Cooked That Up?</a>&#60;/ref&#62; by Uno&#39;s founder <a href="/Ike_Sewell" title="Ike Sewell">Ike Sewell</a>, a former <a href="/Texas_Longhorns_football" title="Texas Longhorns football">University of Texas football</a> star. However, a 1956 article from the <i><a href="/Chicago_Daily_News" title="Chicago Daily News">Chicago Daily News</a></i> asserts that Uno&#39;s original pizza chef Rudy Malnati developed the recipe.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.pizanoschicago.com/about.php" rel="nofollow">Pizano&#39;s History Page</a>&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>The primary difference between deep-dish pizza and most other forms of pizza is that, as the name suggests, the crust is very deep, creating a very thick pizza that resembles a pie more than a <a href="/Flatbread" title="Flatbread">flatbread</a>. Although the entire pizza is very thick, in traditional Chicago-style deep-dish pizzas, the crust itself is thin to medium in thickness.</p>
<p>Deep-dish pizza is baked in a round, steel pan that is more similar to a cake or pie pan than a typical pizza pan. The pan is oiled in order to allow for easy removal as well as to create a <a href="/Deep_frying" title="Deep frying">fried</a> effect on the outside of the crust. In addition to ordinary wheat flour, the pizza dough may contain corn meal, <a href="/Semolina" title="Semolina">semolina</a>, or food coloring, giving the crust a distinctly yellowish tone. The dough is pressed up onto the sides of the pan, forming a bowl for a very thick layer of toppings.</p>
<p>The thick layer of toppings used in deep-dish pizza requires a longer baking time, which could burn cheese or other toppings if they were used as the top layer of the pizza. Because of this, the toppings are assembled &#34;upside-down&#34; from their usual order on a pizza. The crust is covered with cheese (generally sliced <a href="/Mozzarella" title="Mozzarella">mozzarella</a>), followed by various meat options such as <a href="/Pepperoni" title="Pepperoni">pepperoni</a> or <a href="/Italian_sausage" title="Italian sausage">sausage</a>, the latter of which is sometimes in a solid patty-like layer. Other toppings such as <a href="/Onion" title="Onion">onions</a>, <a href="/Mushroom" title="Mushroom">mushrooms</a> and <a href="/Bell_pepper" title="Bell pepper">bell peppers</a> are then also used. An uncooked sauce, typically made from crushed canned tomatoes, is added as the finishing layer.&#60;ref name=autogenerated1 /&#62; It is typical that when ordered for carry-out or delivery, the pizza is uncut, as this prevents the oils from soaking into the crust, causing the pie to become soggy.</p>
<p>Some Chicago deep-dish pizza restaurants ship their partially baked pizzas within the continental U.S.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite book | last1 = Zimmerman | first1 = Karla | last2 = Cavalieri | first2 = Nate | title = Chicago: city guide | publisher = Lonely Planet | year = 2008 | pages = 122 | accessdate = 2010-09-06 | <a class="external text" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/">isbn </a>= 1-74104-767-6}}&#60;/ref&#62;&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.tastesofchicago.com/category/Lou_Malnatis_Pizza" rel="nofollow">Lou Malnati&#39;s Deep Dish Pizza</a>&#60;/ref&#62;</p>

By the mid-1970s, two Chicago chains, <a href="/Chicago_Franchise_Systems%2C_Inc." title="Chicago Franchise Systems, Inc.">Nancy&#39;s Pizza</a>, founded by Rocco Palese, and <a href="/Giordano&#39;s_Pizzeria" title="Giordano&#39;s Pizzeria">Giordano&#39;s Pizzeria</a>, operated by brothers Efren and Joseph Boglio, began experimenting with deep dish pizza and created the stuffed pizza.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite book  | last = Pollack | first = Penny |author2=Jeff Ruby | title = Everybody Loves Pizza | publisher = Emmis Books | date = 2005 | pages = 33 | <a class="external text" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/">isbn </a>= 1-57860-218-1 }}&#60;/ref&#62; Palese based his creation on his mother&#39;s recipe for scarciedda, an Italian <a href="/Easter" title="Easter">Easter</a> pie from his hometown of <a href="/Potenza" title="Potenza">Potenza</a>.&#60;ref name=&#34;Nancys&#34;&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.nancyspizza.com/html/about_us.html" rel="nofollow">Nancy&#39;s Pizza</a>&#60;/ref&#62; <i>Chicago Magazine</i> articles featuring Nancy&#39;s Pizza and Giordano&#39;s stuffed pizza popularized the dish.</p>
<p>Stuffed pizzas are often even deeper than deep-dish pizzas, but otherwise, it can be hard to see the difference until it is cut into. A stuffed pizza generally has much deeper topping density than any other type of pizza. As with deep-dish pizza, a deep layer of dough forms a bowl in a high-sided pan and the toppings and cheese are added. Then, an additional layer of dough goes on top and is pressed to the sides of the crust.</p>
<p>At this stage, the thin dough top has a rounded, domed appearance. Pizza makers often poke a small hole in the top of the &#34;lid&#34; to allow air and steam to escape while cooking, so that the pizza does not explode. Usually, but not always, tomato sauce is ladled over the top crust before the pizza is baked.
