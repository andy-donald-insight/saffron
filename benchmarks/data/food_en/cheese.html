<b>Cheese</b> is a food derived from milk that is produced in a wide range of flavors, textures, and forms by <a href="/Coagulation_(milk)" title="Coagulation (milk)">coagulation</a> of the milk protein <a href="/Casein" title="Casein">casein</a>. It comprises proteins and <a href="/Fat" title="Fat">fat</a> from <a href="/Milk" title="Milk">milk</a>, usually the milk of <a href="/Cattle" title="Cattle">cows</a>, <a href="/Water_buffalo" title="Water buffalo">buffalo</a>, <a href="/Goat" title="Goat">goats</a>, or <a href="/Sheep&#39;s_milk" title="Sheep&#39;s milk">sheep</a>. During production, the milk is usually acidified, and adding the enzyme <a href="/Rennet" title="Rennet">rennet</a> causes coagulation. The solids are separated and pressed into final form.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|title=Fankhauser&#39;s Cheese Page|first=David B.|last=Fankhauser|year=2007|accessdate=September 23, 2007|url=<a class="external free" href="http://biology.clc.uc.edu/fankhauser/Cheese/CHEESE.HTML" rel="nofollow">http://biology.clc.uc.edu/fankhauser/Cheese/CHEESE.HTML</a>}}&#60;/ref&#62; Some cheeses have <a href="/Mold" title="Mold">molds</a> on the rind or throughout. Most cheeses melt at cooking temperature.</p>
<p>Hundreds of <a href="/List_of_cheeses" title="List of cheeses">types of cheese</a> from various countries are produced. Their styles, <a href="/Mouthfeel" title="Mouthfeel">textures</a> and flavors depend on the origin of the milk (including the animal&#39;s diet), whether they have been <a href="/Pasteurization" title="Pasteurization">pasteurized</a>, the <a href="/Butterfat" title="Butterfat">butterfat</a> content, the bacteria and mold, the processing, and aging. <a href="/Herb" title="Herb">Herbs</a>, <a href="/Spice" title="Spice">spices</a>, or <a href="/Smoking_(cooking)" title="Smoking (cooking)">wood smoke</a> may be used as flavoring agents. The yellow to red color of many cheeses, such as <a href="/Red_Leicester" title="Red Leicester">Red Leicester</a>, is produced by adding <a href="/Annatto" title="Annatto">annatto</a>. Other ingredients may be added to some cheeses, such as <a href="/Black_pepper" title="Black pepper">black pepper</a>, <a href="/Garlic" title="Garlic">garlic</a>, <a href="/Chives" title="Chives">chives</a> or <a href="/Cranberry" title="Cranberry">cranberries</a>.</p>
<p>For a few cheeses, the milk is curdled by adding <a href="/Acid" title="Acid">acids</a> such as <a href="/Vinegar" title="Vinegar">vinegar</a> or <a href="/Lemon_juice" title="Lemon juice">lemon juice</a>. Most cheeses are acidified to a lesser degree by bacteria, which turn <a href="/Lactose" title="Lactose">milk sugars</a> into <a href="/Lactic_acid" title="Lactic acid">lactic acid</a>, then the addition of <a href="/Rennet" title="Rennet">rennet</a> completes the curdling. <a href="/Vegetarianism" title="Vegetarianism">Vegetarian</a> alternatives to rennet are available; most are produced by fermentation of the <a href="/Fungus" title="Fungus">fungus</a> <i>Mucor miehei</i>, but others have been extracted from various species of the <i><a href="/Cynara" title="Cynara">Cynara</a></i> thistle family. <a href="/Cheesemaker" title="Cheesemaker">Cheesemakers</a> near a dairy region may benefit from fresher, lower-priced milk, and lower shipping costs.</p>
<p>Cheese is valued for its portability, long life, and high content of <a href="/Fat" title="Fat">fat</a>, <a href="/Protein" title="Protein">protein</a>, <a href="/Calcium" title="Calcium">calcium</a>, and <a href="/Phosphorus" title="Phosphorus">phosphorus</a>. Cheese is more compact and has a longer shelf life than milk, although how long a cheese will keep depends on the type of cheese; labels on packets of cheese often claim that a cheese should be consumed within three to five days of opening. Generally speaking, hard cheeses, such as <a href="/Parmesan" title="Parmesan">parmesan</a> last longer than soft cheeses, such as <a href="/Brie" title="Brie">Brie</a> or goat&#39;s milk cheese. The long storage life of some cheeses, especially when encased in a protective rind, allows selling when markets are favorable.</p>
<p>There is some debate as to the best way to store cheese, but some experts{{Who|date=June 2015}} say that wrapping it in cheese paper provides optimal results. Cheese paper is coated in a porous plastic on the inside, and the outside has a layer of wax. This specific combination of plastic on the inside and wax on the outside protects the cheese by allowing condensation on the cheese to be wicked away while preventing moisture from within the cheese escaping.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/lifestyles/food/ct-food-0716-fridge-cheese-paper-20140716-story.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.chicagotribune.com/lifestyles/food/ct-food-0716-fridge-cheese-paper-20140716-story.html</a>|title=Cheese Paper: How It Saves Your Cheese}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>A specialist seller of cheese is sometimes known as a <i>cheesemonger</i>. Becoming an expert in this field requires some formal education and years of tasting and hands-on experience, much like becoming an expert in wine or cuisine. The cheesemonger is responsible for all aspects of the cheese inventory: selecting the cheese menu, purchasing, receiving, storage, and ripening.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.reluctantgourmet.com/cheesemonge.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.reluctantgourmet.com/cheesemonge.htm</a> |title=&#39;&#38;#39;Conversation with a Cheese Monger&#39;&#38;#39;}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>

The word <i>cheese</i> comes from Latin <i>caseus</i>,&#60;ref&#62;{{cite book|last=Simpson|first=D. P.|title=Cassell&#39;s Latin Dictionary|publisher=Cassell Ltd.|year=1979|edition=5th|location=London|page=883|isbn=0-304-52257-0}}&#60;/ref&#62; from which the modern word <a href="/Casein" title="Casein">casein</a> is also derived. The earliest source is from the <a href="/Proto-Indo-European_language" title="Proto-Indo-European language">proto-Indo-European</a> root <i>*kwat-</i>, which means &#34;to ferment, become sour&#34;.</p>
<p>More recently, <i>cheese</i> comes from <i>chese</i> (in <a href="/Middle_English" title="Middle English">Middle English</a>) and <i>cīese</i> or <i>cēse</i> (in <a href="/Old_English" title="Old English">Old English</a>). Similar words are shared by other <a href="/West_Germanic_languages" title="West Germanic languages">West Germanic languages</a>—<a href="/West_Frisian_language" title="West Frisian language">West Frisian</a> <i>tsiis</i>, <a href="/Dutch_language" title="Dutch language">Dutch</a> <i>kaas</i>, <a href="/German_language" title="German language">German</a> <i>Käse</i>, <a href="/Old_High_German" title="Old High German">Old High German</a> <i>chāsi</i>—all from the reconstructed West-Germanic form <i>*kāsī</i>, which in turn is an early borrowing from Latin.</p>
<p>When the Romans began to make hard cheeses for their legionaries&#39; supplies, a new word started to be used: <i>formaticum</i>, from <i>caseus formatus</i>, or &#34;molded cheese&#34; (as in &#34;formed&#34;, not &#34;moldy&#34;). It is from this word that the <a href="/French_language" title="French language">French</a> <i>fromage</i>, proper <a href="/Italian_language" title="Italian language">Italian</a> <i>formaggio</i>, <a href="/Catalan_language" title="Catalan language">Catalan</a> <i>formatge</i>, <a href="/Breton_language" title="Breton language">Breton</a> <i>fourmaj</i>, and <a href="/Proven%C3%A7al_language" title="Provençal language">Provençal</a> <i>furmo</i> are derived. Of the Romance languages, <a href="/Spanish_language" title="Spanish language">Spanish</a> and <a href="/Portuguese_language" title="Portuguese language">Portuguese</a> and many <a href="/Tuscan" title="Tuscan">Tuscan</a> and Southern Italian dialects use words derived from <i>caseus</i> (<i>queso</i>, <i>queijo</i> and <i>caso</i> for example). The word <i>cheese</i> itself is occasionally employed in a sense that means &#34;molded&#34; or &#34;formed&#34;. <i><a href="/Head_cheese" title="Head cheese">Head cheese</a></i> uses the word in this sense.</p>

Cheese is an ancient food whose origins predate <a href="/Prehistory" title="Prehistory">recorded history</a>. There is no conclusive evidence indicating where cheesemaking originated, either in <a href="/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a>, <a href="/Central_Asia" title="Central Asia">Central Asia</a> or <a href="/The_Middle_East" title="The Middle East">the Middle East</a>, but the practice had spread within Europe prior to <a href="/Ancient_Rome" title="Ancient Rome">Roman</a> times and, according to <a href="/Pliny_the_Elder" title="Pliny the Elder">Pliny the Elder</a>, had become a sophisticated enterprise by the time the <a href="/Ancient_Rome" title="Ancient Rome">Roman Empire</a> came into being.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.thenibble.com/REVIEWS/main/cheese/cheese2/history.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.thenibble.com/REVIEWS/main/cheese/cheese2/history.asp</a>|title=The History Of Cheese: From An Ancient Nomad&#39;s Horseback To Today&#39;s Luxury Cheese Cart|work=The Nibble|publisher=Lifestyle Direct, Inc.|accessdate=October 8, 2009}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>The earliest evidence of cheese-making in the archaeological record dates back to 5,500 BCE, in what is now <a href="/Kujawy" title="Kujawy">Kujawy</a>, <a href="/Poland" title="Poland">Poland</a>, where strainers with milk fats molecules have been found.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.nature.com/news/art-of-cheese-making-is-7-500-years-old-1.12020" rel="nofollow">http://www.nature.com/news/art-of-cheese-making-is-7-500-years-old-1.12020</a>|title=Art of cheese-making is 7,500 years old|publisher=Nature|date=December 12, 2012 }}&#60;/ref&#62; Earliest proposed dates for the origin of cheesemaking range from around 8000 <a href="/Common_Era" title="Common Era">BCE</a>, when <a href="/Sheep" title="Sheep">sheep</a> were first <a href="/Domestication" title="Domestication">domesticated</a>. Since animal skins and inflated internal organs have, since ancient times, provided storage vessels for a range of foodstuffs, it is probable that the process of cheese making was discovered accidentally by storing milk in a container made from the stomach of an animal, resulting in the milk being turned to <a href="/Curd" title="Curd">curd</a> and <a href="/Whey" title="Whey">whey</a> by the rennet from the stomach. There is a <a href="/Legend" title="Legend">legend</a>&#38;nbsp;– with variations&#38;nbsp;– about the discovery of cheese by an Arab trader who used this method of storing milk.&#60;ref&#62;Jenny Ridgwell, Judy Ridgway, <i>Food around the World</i>, (1986) Oxford University Press, <a class="external text" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0198327285" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0198327285">ISBN 0-19-832728-5</a>&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>Cheesemaking may have begun independently of this by the pressing and salting of curdled milk to preserve it. Observation that the effect of making cheese in an animal stomach gave more solid and better-textured curds may have led to the deliberate addition of rennet.</p>
<p>Early <a href="/Archeology" title="Archeology">archeological</a> evidence of <a href="/Egyptian_cheese" title="Egyptian cheese">Egyptian cheese</a> has been found in <a href="/Ancient_Egypt" title="Ancient Egypt">Egyptian</a> tomb murals, dating to about 2000&#38;nbsp;BCE.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|title=History of Cheese|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.gol27.com/HistoryCheese.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.gol27.com/HistoryCheese.html</a>|work=www.gol27.com|accessdate=December 23, 2014}}&#60;/ref&#62; The earliest cheeses were likely to have been quite sour and salty, similar in texture to rustic <a href="/Cottage_cheese" title="Cottage cheese">cottage cheese</a> or <a href="/Feta" title="Feta">feta</a>, a crumbly, flavorful Greek cheese.</p>
<p>Cheese produced in Europe, where climates are cooler than the Middle East, required less salt for preservation.

<p>As Romanized populations encountered unfamiliar newly settled neighbors, bringing their own cheese-making traditions, their own flocks and their own unrelated words for <i>cheese</i>, cheeses in Europe diversified further, with various locales developing their own distinctive traditions and products.

<p>Until its modern spread along with European culture, cheese was nearly unheard of in east Asian cultures, in the pre-Columbian Americas, and only had limited use in sub-Mediterranean Africa, mainly being widespread and popular only in Europe, the Middle East, the <a href="/Indian_subcontinent" title="Indian subcontinent">Indian subcontinent</a>, and areas influenced by those cultures. But with the spread, first of European imperialism, and later of Euro-American culture and food, cheese has gradually become known and increasingly popular worldwide, though still rarely considered a part of local ethnic cuisines outside Europe, the Middle East, the Indian subcontinent, and the Americas.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}</p>
<p>The first factory for the industrial production of cheese opened in Switzerland in 1815, but large-scale production first found real success in the United States. Credit usually goes to Jesse Williams, a dairy farmer from <a href="/Rome%2C_New_York" title="Rome, New York">Rome</a>, <a href="/New_York" title="New York">New York</a>, who in 1851 started making cheese in an <a href="/Assembly_line" title="Assembly line">assembly-line</a> fashion using the milk from neighboring farms. Within decades, hundreds of such dairy associations existed.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}</p>
<p>The 1860s saw the beginnings of mass-produced rennet, and by the turn of the century scientists were producing pure microbial cultures. Before then, bacteria in cheesemaking had come from the environment or from recycling an earlier batch&#39;s whey; the pure cultures meant a more standardized cheese could be produced.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.traditionalfrenchfood.com/history-of-cheese.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.traditionalfrenchfood.com/history-of-cheese.html</a>|title=History of Cheese|work=traditionalfrenchfood.com}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>Factory-made cheese overtook traditional cheesemaking in the <a href="/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a> era, and factories have been the source of most cheese in America and Europe ever since.</p>

<p>
A required step in cheesemaking is separating the milk into solid <a href="/Curd" title="Curd">curds</a> and liquid <a href="/Whey" title="Whey">whey</a>. Usually this is done by acidifying (<a href="/Souring" title="Souring">souring</a>) the milk and adding <a href="/Rennet" title="Rennet">rennet</a>. The acidification can be accomplished directly by the addition of an acid, such as vinegar, in a few cases (<a href="/Paneer" title="Paneer">paneer</a>, <a href="/Queso_fresco" title="Queso fresco">queso fresco</a>). More commonly <a href="/Starter_bacteria" title="Starter bacteria">starter bacteria</a> are employed instead which convert <a href="/Lactose" title="Lactose">milk sugars</a> into <a href="/Lactic_acid" title="Lactic acid">lactic acid</a>. The same bacteria (and the <a href="/Enzyme" title="Enzyme">enzymes</a> they produce) also play a large role in the eventual flavor of aged cheeses. Most cheeses are made with starter bacteria from the <i><a href="/Lactococci" title="Lactococci">Lactococcus</a></i>, <i><a href="/Lactobacilli" title="Lactobacilli">Lactobacillus</a></i>, or <i><a href="/Streptococci" title="Streptococci">Streptococcus</a></i> families. <a href="/Cheeses_of_Switzerland" title="Cheeses of Switzerland">Swiss</a> starter cultures also include <i><a href="/Propionibacter_shermani" title="Propionibacter shermani">Propionibacter shermani</a></i>, which produces carbon dioxide gas bubbles during aging, giving <a href="/Swiss_cheese" title="Swiss cheese">Swiss cheese</a> or <a href="/Emmental_(cheese)" title="Emmental (cheese)">Emmental</a> its holes (called &#34;<a href="/Eyes_(cheese)" title="Eyes (cheese)">eyes</a>&#34;).</p>
<p>Some fresh cheeses are curdled only by acidity, but most cheeses also use rennet. Rennet sets the cheese into a strong and rubbery <a href="/Gel" title="Gel">gel</a> compared to the fragile curds produced by acidic coagulation alone. It also allows curdling at a lower acidity—important because flavor-making bacteria are inhibited in high-acidity environments. In general, softer, smaller, fresher cheeses are curdled with a greater proportion of acid to rennet than harder, larger, longer-aged varieties.</p>
<p>While rennet was traditionally produced via extraction from the inner mucosa of the fourth stomach chamber of slaughtered young, unweaned calves, most rennet used today in cheesemaking is produced <a href="/Recombinant_DNA" title="Recombinant DNA">recombinantly</a>.&#60;ref name=&#34;GMO Database&#34;&#62;{{cite web|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.gmo-compass.org/eng/database/enzymes/83.chymosin.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.gmo-compass.org/eng/database/enzymes/83.chymosin.html</a>|publisher=GMO Compass|title=Chymosin|accessdate=March 3, 2011}}&#60;/ref&#62; The majority of the applied chymosin is retained in the <a href="/Whey" title="Whey">whey</a> and, at most, may be present in cheese in trace quantities. In ripe cheese, the type and provenance of chymosin used in production cannot be determined.&#60;ref name=&#34;GMO Database&#34; /&#62;</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Curd_processing">Curd processing</span></h3>
<p>At this point, the cheese has set into a very moist gel. Some soft cheeses are now essentially complete: they are drained, salted, and packaged. For most of the rest, the curd is cut into small cubes. This allows water to drain from the individual pieces of curd.</p>
<p>Some hard cheeses are then heated to temperatures in the range of {{convert|35|–|55|C|F}}. This forces more whey from the cut curd. It also changes the taste of the finished cheese, affecting both the bacterial culture and the milk chemistry. Cheeses that are heated to the higher temperatures are usually made with <a href="/Thermophilic" title="Thermophilic">thermophilic</a> starter bacteria that survive this step—either <i><a href="/Lactobacilli" title="Lactobacilli">Lactobacilli</a></i> or <i><a href="/Streptococcus_salivarius" title="Streptococcus salivarius">Streptococci</a></i>.</p>
<p>Salt has roles in cheese besides adding a salty flavor. It preserves cheese from spoiling, draws moisture from the curd, and firms cheese’s texture in an interaction with its <a href="/Protein" title="Protein">proteins</a>. Some cheeses are salted from the outside with dry salt or brine washes. Most cheeses have the salt mixed directly into the curds.

</div>

<p>Other techniques influence a cheese&#39;s texture and flavor. Some examples are :
</p>
<ul>
<li>Stretching: (<a href="/Mozzarella" title="Mozzarella">Mozzarella</a>, <a href="/Provolone_(cheese)" title="Provolone (cheese)">Provolone</a>) The curd is stretched and kneaded in hot water, developing a stringy, fibrous body.</li>
<li><a href="/Cheddaring" title="Cheddaring">Cheddaring</a>: (<a href="/Cheddar_cheese" title="Cheddar cheese">Cheddar</a>, other English cheeses) The cut curd is repeatedly piled up, pushing more moisture away. The curd is also mixed (or <i>milled</i>) for a long time, taking the sharp edges off the cut curd pieces and influencing the final product&#39;s texture.</li>
<li>Washing: (<a href="/Edam_(cheese)" title="Edam (cheese)">Edam</a>, <a href="/Gouda_cheese" title="Gouda cheese">Gouda</a>, <a href="/Colby_cheese" title="Colby cheese">Colby</a>) The curd is washed in warm water, lowering its acidity and making for a milder-tasting cheese.</li>
</ul>

<p>Most cheeses achieve their final shape when the curds are pressed into a mold or form. The harder the cheese, the more pressure is applied. The pressure drives out moisture—the molds are designed to allow water to escape—and unifies the curds into a single solid body.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Ripening">Ripening</span></h3>
<p>{{Main|Cheese ripening}}
A newborn cheese is usually salty yet bland in flavor and, for harder varieties, rubbery in texture. These qualities are sometimes enjoyed—<a href="/Cheese_curds" title="Cheese curds">cheese curds</a> are eaten on their own—but normally cheeses are left to rest under controlled conditions. This aging period (also called ripening, or, from the French, <i>affinage</i>) lasts from a few days to several years. As a cheese ages, microbes and enzymes transform texture and intensify flavor. This transformation is largely a result of the breakdown of casein proteins and <a href="/Butterfat" title="Butterfat">milkfat</a> into a complex mix of <a href="/Amino_acid" title="Amino acid">amino acids</a>, <a href="/Amine" title="Amine">amines</a>, and <a href="/Fatty_acid" title="Fatty acid">fatty acids</a>.</p>
<p>Some cheeses have additional bacteria or <a href="/Mold" title="Mold">molds</a> intentionally introduced before or during aging. In traditional cheesemaking, these microbes might be already present in the aging room; they are simply allowed to settle and grow on the stored cheeses. More often today, prepared cultures are used, giving more consistent results and putting fewer constraints on the environment where the cheese ages. These cheeses include soft ripened cheeses such as <a href="/Brie_(cheese)" title="Brie (cheese)">Brie</a> and <a href="/Camembert_(cheese)" title="Camembert (cheese)">Camembert</a>, blue cheeses such as <a href="/Roquefort_(cheese)" title="Roquefort (cheese)">Roquefort</a>, <a href="/Stilton_(cheese)" title="Stilton (cheese)">Stilton</a>, <a href="/Gorgonzola_(cheese)" title="Gorgonzola (cheese)">Gorgonzola</a>, and <a href="/Rind-washed_cheese" title="Rind-washed cheese">rind-washed cheeses</a> such as <a href="/Limburger_cheese" title="Limburger cheese">Limburger</a>.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Moisture content (soft to hard)</dt>
</dl>
<p>Categorizing cheeses by firmness is a common but inexact practice. The lines between &#34;soft&#34;, &#34;semi-soft&#34;, &#34;semi-hard&#34;, and &#34;hard&#34; are arbitrary, and many types of cheese are made in softer or firmer variations. The main factor that controls cheese hardness is moisture content, which depends largely on the pressure with which it is packed into molds, and on aging time.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Fresh, whey and stretched curd cheeses</dt>

<p>The main factor in the categorization of these cheeses is their age. Fresh cheeses without additional <a href="/Preservative" title="Preservative">preservatives</a> can spoil in a matter of days.</p>

<p>
Some cheeses are categorized by the source of the milk used to produce them or by the added fat content of the milk from which they are produced. While most of the world&#39;s commercially available cheese is made from cows&#39; milk, many parts of the world also produce cheese from goats and sheep. Double cream cheeses are soft cheeses of cows&#39; milk enriched with cream so that their fat content is 60% or, in the case of triple creams, 75%. The use of the terms &#34;double&#34; or &#34;triple&#34; is not meant to give a quantitative reference to the change in fat content, since the fat content of whole cows&#39; milk is 3%-4%.</p>

<dl>

<p>There are at least three main categories of cheese in which the presence of mold is a significant feature: soft ripened cheeses, <a href="/Washed-rind_cheese" title="Washed-rind cheese">washed rind</a> cheeses and blue cheeses.</p>

At <a href="/Refrigerator" title="Refrigerator">refrigerator</a> temperatures, the fat in a piece of cheese is as hard as unsoftened <a href="/Butter" title="Butter">butter</a>, and its protein structure is stiff as well. Flavor and odor compounds are less easily liberated when cold. For improvements in flavor and texture, it is widely advised that cheeses be allowed to warm up to <a href="/Room_temperature" title="Room temperature">room temperature</a> before eating. If the cheese is further warmed, to {{convert|26|–|32|C|F}}, the fats will begin to &#34;sweat out&#34; as they go beyond soft to fully liquid.&#60;ref&#62;{{Harv|McGee|2004|p=63}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>Above room temperatures, most hard cheeses melt. Rennet-curdled cheeses have a <a href="/Gel" title="Gel">gel</a>-like protein matrix that is broken down by heat. When enough protein bonds are broken, the cheese itself turns from a solid to a viscous liquid. Soft, high-moisture cheeses will melt at around {{convert|55|C}}, while hard, low-moisture cheeses such as Parmesan remain solid until they reach about {{convert|82|C}}.&#60;ref&#62;{{Harv|McGee|2004|p=64}}&#60;/ref&#62; Acid-set cheeses, including <a href="/Halloumi_cheese" title="Halloumi cheese">halloumi</a>, <a href="/Paneer" title="Paneer">paneer</a>, some whey cheeses and many varieties of fresh <a href="/Goat_cheese" title="Goat cheese">goat cheese</a>, have a protein structure that remains intact at high temperatures. When cooked, these cheeses just get firmer as water evaporates.</p>
<p>Some cheeses, like <a href="/Raclette" title="Raclette">raclette</a>, melt smoothly; many tend to become stringy or suffer from a separation of their fats. Many of these can be coaxed into melting smoothly in the presence of acids or <a href="/Starch" title="Starch">starch</a>. <a href="/Fondue" title="Fondue">Fondue</a>, with wine providing the acidity, is a good example of a smoothly melted cheese dish.&#60;ref&#62;{{Harv|McGee|2004|p=66}}&#60;/ref&#62; Elastic stringiness is a quality that is sometimes enjoyed, in dishes including <a href="/Pizza" title="Pizza">pizza</a> and <a href="/Welsh_rarebit" title="Welsh rarebit">Welsh rarebit</a>. Even a melted cheese eventually turns solid again, after enough moisture is cooked off. The saying &#34;you can&#39;t melt cheese twice&#34; (meaning &#34;some things can only be done once&#34;) refers to the fact that oils leach out during the first melting and are gone, leaving the non-meltable solids behind.</p>
<p>As its temperature continues to rise, cheese will <a href="/Non-enzymatic_browning" title="Non-enzymatic browning">brown</a> and eventually burn. Browned, partially burned cheese has a particular distinct flavor of its own and is frequently used in cooking (e.g., sprinkling atop items before baking them).</p>

<p>The nutritional value of cheese varies widely. Cottage cheese may consist of 4% fat and 11% protein; some whey cheeses 15% fat and 11% protein,&#60;ref&#62;<a href="/Anari_cheese" title="Anari cheese">Anari cheese</a>&#60;/ref&#62; and some triple-crème cheeses 36% fat and 7% protein.

A review of the medical literature published in 2012 noted that: &#34;Cheese consumption is the leading contributor of SF (saturated fat) in the U.S. diet, and therefore would be predicted to increase LDL-C (LDL cholesterol) and consequently increase the risk of CVD (cardiovascular disease).&#34; It found that: &#34;Based on results from numerous prospective observational studies and meta-analyses, most, but not all, have shown no association and in some cases an inverse relationship between the intake of milk fat containing dairy products and the risk of CVD, CHD (coronary heart disease), and stroke. A limited number of prospective cohort studies found no significant association between the intake of total full-fat dairy products and the risk of CHD or stroke....Most clinical studies showed that full-fat natural cheese, a highly fermented product, significantly lowers LDL-C compared with butter intake of equal total fat and saturated fat content.&#34; &#60;ref&#62;Huth PJ, Park KM.

Although cheese is a vital source of nutrition in many regions of the world and is extensively consumed in others, its use is not universal.</p>
<p>Cheese is rarely found in <a href="/East_Asian_cuisine" title="East Asian cuisine">East Asian cuisines</a>, presumably for historical reasons. However, East Asian sentiment against cheese is not universal. In <a href="/Nepal" title="Nepal">Nepal</a> the Dairy Development Corporation commercially manufactures cheese made from <a href="/Yak" title="Yak">yak</a> milk and is very popular with the country&#39;s population and the visiting tourists, also a very hard cheese made from either <a href="/Cow" title="Cow">cow</a> or yak milk knows as <a href="/Chhurpi" title="Chhurpi">chhurpi</a> is equally popular among the population. The national dish of <a href="/Bhutan" title="Bhutan">Bhutan</a>, <i>ema datsi</i>, is made from homemade yak or <a href="/Mare_(horse)" title="Mare (horse)">mare</a> milk cheese and hot peppers. In <a href="/Yunnan" title="Yunnan">Yunnan</a>, <a href="/China" title="China">China</a>, several ethnic minority groups produce <a href="/Rushan_(cheese)" title="Rushan (cheese)">Rushan</a> and <a href="/Rubing" title="Rubing">Rubing</a> from cow&#39;s milk.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} Cheese consumption is increasing in China, with annual sales more than doubling from 1996 to 2003 (to a still small 30&#38;nbsp;million <a href="/United_States_dollar" title="United States dollar">U.S. dollars</a> a year).&#60;ref&#62;{{cite journal|author=<a href="/Rebecca_Buckman" title="Rebecca Buckman">Rebecca Buckman</a>|title=Let Them Eat Cheese|series=166|journal=<a href="/Far_Eastern_Economic_Review" title="Far Eastern Economic Review">Far Eastern Economic Review</a>|year=2003|volume=n. 49|page=41}} <a class="external text" href="http://www.globalpolicy.org/globaliz/cultural/2003/1211chinacheese.htm" rel="nofollow">Full text</a>.&#60;/ref&#62; Certain kinds of Chinese preserved <a href="/Bean_curd#Fermented" title="Bean curd">bean curd</a> are sometimes misleadingly referred to in English as &#34;Chinese cheese&#34;, because of their texture and strong flavor.</p>
<p>Strict followers of the dietary laws of <a href="/Islam" title="Islam">Islam</a> and <a href="/Judaism" title="Judaism">Judaism</a> must avoid cheeses made with rennet from animals not slaughtered in a manner adhering to <a href="/Halal" title="Halal">halal</a> or <a href="/Kosher_foods" title="Kosher foods">kosher</a> laws.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.toronto.ca/health/nm_faq_halal_foods.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.toronto.ca/health/nm_faq_halal_foods.htm</a>|title=Frequently Asked Questions about Halal Foods|publisher=Toronto Public Health|accessdate=October 15, 2005|archiveurl=<a class="external free" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20051124105844/http://www.toronto.ca/health/nm_faq_halal_foods.htm" rel="nofollow">https://web.archive.org/web/20051124105844/http://www.toronto.ca/health/nm_faq_halal_foods.htm</a>|archivedate=November 24, 2005|deadurl=yes}}&#60;/ref&#62; Both faiths allow cheese made with vegetable-based rennet or with rennet made from animals that were processed in a halal or kosher manner. Many less orthodox Jews also believe that rennet undergoes enough processing to change its nature entirely and do not consider it to ever violate kosher law. (See <i><a href="/Kosher_foods#Cheese" title="Kosher foods">Cheese and kashrut</a></i>.) As cheese is a dairy food, under kosher rules it cannot be eaten in the same meal with any meat.</p>
<p>Rennet derived from animal slaughter, and thus cheese made with animal-derived rennet, is not <a href="/Vegetarianism" title="Vegetarianism">vegetarian</a>. Most widely available vegetarian cheeses are made using rennet produced by fermentation of the <a href="/Fungus" title="Fungus">fungus</a> <i>Mucor miehei</i>. <a href="/Vegan" title="Vegan">Vegans</a> and other dairy-avoiding vegetarians do not eat real cheese at all, but some vegetable-based cheese substitutes (usually <a href="/Soybean" title="Soybean">soy</a>-and <a href="/Almond" title="Almond">almond</a>-based) are available.</p>
<p>Even in cultures with long cheese traditions, it is not unusual to find people who perceive cheese—especially pungent-smelling or mold-bearing varieties such as <a href="/Limburger_cheese" title="Limburger cheese">Limburger</a> or <a href="/Roquefort_(cheese)" title="Roquefort (cheese)">Roquefort</a>—as unpalatable. <a href="/Food_science" title="Food science">Food-science</a> writer <a href="/Harold_McGee" title="Harold McGee">Harold McGee</a> proposes that cheese is such an acquired taste because it is produced through a process of controlled <a href="/Decomposition" title="Decomposition">spoilage</a> and many of the odor and flavor molecules in an aged cheese are the same found in rotten foods. He notes, &#34;An aversion to the odor of decay has the obvious biological value of steering us away from possible food poisoning, so it is no wonder that an animal food that gives off whiffs of shoes and soil and the stable takes some getting used to.&#34;&#60;ref&#62;McGee p 58, &#34;Why Some People Can&#39;t Stand Cheese&#34;&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
