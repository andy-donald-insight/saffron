<p>The &#34;king cake&#34; takes its name from the biblical three <a href="/Biblical_Magi" title="Biblical Magi">kings</a>. In Catholic liturgical tradition, the Solemnity of <a href="/Epiphany_(holiday)" title="Epiphany (holiday)">Epiphany</a>—commemorated on January 6—celebrates the visit of the Magi to the Christ Child. The Eve of Epiphany (the night of January 5) is popularly known as Twelfth Night (the <a href="/Twelve_Days_of_Christmas" title="Twelve Days of Christmas">Twelve Days of Christmas</a> are counted from Christmas Eve until this night). The season for king cake extends from the end of the Twelve Days of Christmas (<a href="/Twelfth_Night_(holiday)" title="Twelfth Night (holiday)">Twelfth Night</a> and Epiphany Day), up until Mardi Gras, or &#34;Fat Tuesday;&#34; the day before the start of <a href="/Lent" title="Lent">Lent</a>. Some organizations or groups of friends may have &#34;king cake parties&#34; every week through the Carnival season. In Portugal and France, whoever gets the <a href="#Trinket">King cake trinket</a> is expected to buy the next cake for these get-togethers.</p>
<p>It is a popular food item during the Christmas season (Christmas Eve to Epiphany) in Belgium, France, <a href="/Quebec" title="Quebec">Quebec</a> and Switzerland (<i><a href="/Galette" title="Galette">galette</a></i> or <i>gâteau des Rois</i> or <i>galette des rois</i>), Portugal (<i><a href="/Bolo_Rei" title="Bolo Rei">bolo rei</a></i>), Spain, and Latin America (<a href="/Rosca_de_reyes" title="Rosca de reyes"><i>roscón</i> or <i>rosca de reyes</i></a> and, Greece and Cyprus (<i><a href="/Vasilopita" title="Vasilopita">vasilopita</a></i>) and Bulgaria (<a href="/Banitsa_(pastry)" title="Banitsa (pastry)"><i>banitsa</i></a>).

Traditionally, a small plastic or porcelain baby is hidden into the king cake. It is usually green, gold, or purple to represent the colors of the holiday. Originally, the baby was placed into the cake to symbolize baby Jesus. <a href="/Fava_beans" title="Fava beans">Fava beans</a> were also used to represent Jesus.</p>
<p>Today, the baby symbolizes luck and prosperity to whoever finds it in his/her slice of cake. In some traditions, the finder of the baby is designated “king” or “queen” for the evening. That person is also responsible for purchasing next year’s cake,&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external free" href="http://www.neworleansshowcase.com/hisofkincak.html#.U2gO915bTwJ&#60;/ref&#38;gt" rel="nofollow">http://www.neworleansshowcase.com/hisofkincak.html#.U2gO915bTwJ&#60;/ref&#38;gt</a>; or for throwing the next Mardi Gras party.</p>
<p>Many bakers have recently been placing the baby outside of the cake, and leaving the hiding to the customer. There is a potential of customers choking on or swallowing the baby, and bakers want to stay clear of this responsibility.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external autonumber" href="http://www.epicurious.com/articlesguides/holidays/mardigras/kingcake" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>The <a href="/New_Orleans_Pelicans" title="New Orleans Pelicans">New Orleans Pelicans</a> have also infused the tradition of the king cake baby into their NBA team. Their mascot has always been Pelican Pierre, but they have recently introduced the King Cake Baby as a second mascot during games around Mardi Gras.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Importance_to_New_Orleans">Importance to New Orleans</span></h2>
<p>The King Cake is synonymous with <a href="/Mardi_Gras" title="Mardi Gras">Mardi Gras</a> tradition in New Orleans. Starting on <a href="/Epiphany_(holiday)" title="Epiphany (holiday)">Epiphany</a> on January 6, residents begin holding parties especially dedicated to King Cake. King Cake parties bring families and community members together to celebrate the joyous season of Mardi Gras, with its celebratory krewe parades and festivals. In fact, many in New Orleans take more pride in the Mardi Gras King Cake tradition than the parades. The dessert’s ability to engage friends and family in the “search for the baby,” the small figurine located inside the cake, is a fun way for residents of New Orleans to celebrate their Christian faith.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external free" href="http://www.kingcake.com/t-history.aspx&#60;/ref&#38;gt" rel="nofollow">http://www.kingcake.com/t-history.aspx&#60;/ref&#38;gt</a>;</p>
<p>The dessert’s significance to the city was evident in the first Mardi Gras season after <a href="/Hurricane_Katrina" title="Hurricane Katrina">Hurricane Katrina</a> in 2006. Thousands and thousands of King Cake orders flooded bakeries both inside and outside of Louisiana. This showed that in a time of great need, the people of New Orleans felt security and safety in being able to gather around King Cakes after the disastrous storm. King Cake demand after Hurricane Katrina thus provided another example of how significant the dessert’s tradition is both inside and outside of the region.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external free" href="http://www.mardigrasday.com/mardi-gras-info/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mardigrasday.com/mardi-gras-info/</a> the-importance-of-the-king-cake/&#60;/ref&#62;</p>

<p>There are many different recipes for king cake. However, the most common ones include: milk, butter, yeast, water, brown and white sugar, eggs, salt, nutmeg, flour and cinnamon. The frosting is typically made from <a href="/Confectioner&#39;s_sugar" title="Confectioner&#39;s sugar">confectioner&#39;s sugar</a>, water, lemon juice, and colored sugar crystals.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external free" href="http://www.myrecipes.com/recipe/traditional-king-cake-10000001152929/&#60;/ref&#38;gt" rel="nofollow">http://www.myrecipes.com/recipe/traditional-king-cake-10000001152929/&#60;/ref&#38;gt</a>;</p>
<p>The colors of the king cake originally came from the <a href="/Christian_Religion" title="Christian Religion">Christian Religion</a>. The purple symbolizes justice, the green symbolizes faith, and the gold symbolizes power.

<p>In the southern United States, the tradition was brought to the area by colonists from <a href="/France" title="France">France</a> and <a href="/Spain" title="Spain">Spain</a> and is associated with Carnival (also known as <a href="/Mardi_Gras" title="Mardi Gras">Mardi Gras</a>). Celebrated across the Gulf Coast region from the <a href="/Florida_Panhandle" title="Florida Panhandle">Florida Panhandle</a> to <a href="/East_Texas" title="East Texas">East Texas</a>, it originated in French Alabama and King cake parties in Mobile are documented back to the eighteenth  century.</p>
<p>The king cake of the <a href="/Louisiana" title="Louisiana">Louisiana</a> tradition comes in a number of styles. The most simple, said to be the most traditional, is a ring of twisted cinnamon roll-style dough topped with icing or sugar, usually colored purple, green, and gold (the traditional Mardi Gras colors) with food coloring. King cakes may also be filled with additional foodstuffs- the most common being <a href="/Cream_cheese" title="Cream cheese">cream cheese</a>, <a href="/Praline" title="Praline">praline</a>, cinnamon, or strawberry. A so-called &#34;Zulu King Cake&#34; has chocolate icing with a coconut filling, because the <a href="/Zulu_Social_Aid_%26_Pleasure_Club" title="Zulu Social Aid &amp; Pleasure Club">Krewe of Zulu</a> parade&#39;s most celebrated throw is a coconut. Also, some bakers have now taken the liberty to offer king cakes for other holidays that immediately surround Mardi Gras season, such as green and red-icing king cakes for Christmas, red and pink-icing cakes for Valentine&#39;s Day, and green and white-icing cakes for <a href="/St._Patrick&#39;s_Day" title="St. Patrick&#39;s Day">St. Patrick&#39;s Day</a>. Others have gone a step further and produce specialty king cakes from the beginning of football season for Louisiana State University and <a href="/New_Orleans_Saints" title="New Orleans Saints">New Orleans Saints</a> tailgate parties, then for Halloween, then Thanksgiving—and do not cease until after Mardi Gras season with an Easter holiday king cake. It has become customary in the Southern culture that whoever finds the trinket must provide the next king cake or host the next Mardi Gras party.</p>

The <i><a href="/Rosca_de_reyes" title="Rosca de reyes">roscón de reyes</a></i> in Spain or <i>rosca de reyes</i> in <a href="/Hispanic_America" title="Hispanic America">Latin America</a> is traditionally eaten on January 6, during the celebration of the <i><a href="/Epiphany_(holiday)" title="Epiphany (holiday)">Día de los reyes magos</a></i> (the &#34;Day of the Three Wisemen&#34;). In most of Spain, Mexico and in Latino communities in the United States, this is the day when children get presents from the Three Wise Men. Before going to bed, children in Mexico leave a shoe outside their home, filled with hay or dried grass and a bowl of water as a present for the animals the <i>reyes</i> ride, along with a note for the <i>reyes</i>. The <i>roscón de reyes</i> has an oval shape to symbolize a crown. For decoration, people sometimes use dried and candied fruits such as figs, quince or cherries. The fruit symbolizes the many jewels that a crown would have.</p>
<p>The tradition of placing a bean, candy or figurine of the <a href="/Child_Jesus" title="Child Jesus">baby Jesus</a> inside the cake is followed. Whoever finds it must take it to the nearest church on February 2, <i>Día de la candelaria</i> (<a href="/Presentation_of_Jesus_at_the_Temple" title="Presentation of Jesus at the Temple">Candlemas Day</a>), which celebrates the presentation of Jesus in the Temple. According to the Jewish tradition, an infant was to be presented to God in the Temple forty days after his birth. The use of candles on Candlemas represents the light of Christ presented to the world. In Mexico and the Mexican diaspora in the United States, people who find the baby Jesus figurine in their piece of cake usually agree to host a party on <a href="/Candlemas" title="Candlemas">Candlemas</a> (February 2) and to provide the guests with <a href="/Tamale" title="Tamale">tamales</a> and <a href="/Atole" title="Atole">atole</a>.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|title=Happy Candlemas! ¡Feliz Día de la Candelaria!|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.cancunissafe.com/cancun-events/candlemas-cancun-2010-dia-de-la-candelaria-cancun/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cancunissafe.com/cancun-events/candlemas-cancun-2010-dia-de-la-candelaria-cancun/</a>|work=CancunSafe|publisher=NeuMedia|accessdate=2 March 2011}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>

The cake traditionally celebrating <a href="/Epiphany_(holiday)" title="Epiphany (holiday)">Epiphany</a> in <a href="/France" title="France">France</a> and <a href="/Quebec" title="Quebec">Quebec</a> is sold in most bakeries during the month of January. Three versions exist: in northern France, Quebec, and <a href="/Belgium" title="Belgium">Belgium</a> the cake called <i>galette des rois</i> (which can be either circular or rectangular) consists of flaky puff pastry layers with a dense center of <a href="/Frangipane" title="Frangipane">frangipane</a> or apple. In the west of France a sablé galette is made, a form of sweetcrust pastry. In southern France—<a href="/Occitania" title="Occitania">Occitania</a>, <a href="/Roussillon" title="Roussillon">Roussillon</a>, <a href="/Provence" title="Provence">Provence</a>, <a href="/Catalonia" title="Catalonia">Catalan</a> where it is called <i><a href="/Tortell" title="Tortell">tortell</a></i>—the cake called <i>gâteau des rois</i> or <i>royaume</i>, is a <a href="/Torus" title="Torus">torus</a>-shaped <a href="/Brioche" title="Brioche">brioche</a> with <a href="/Candied_fruit" title="Candied fruit">candied fruits</a> and sugar, similar in its shape and colours to a crown. This later version is also common to Spain and very similar to New-Orleans king cake.</p>
<p>Tradition holds that the cake is “to draw the kings” to the Epiphany. A figurine, <i>la fève</i>, which can represent anything from a car to a cartoon character, is hidden in the cake and the person who finds the trinket in his or her slice becomes king for the day and will have to offer the next cake. Originally, <i>la fève</i> was literally a <a href="/Broad_bean" title="Broad bean">broad bean</a> (<i>fève</i>), but it was replaced in 1870 by a variety of figurines out of porcelain or—more recently—plastic. These figurines have become popular collectibles and can often be bought separately. Individual bakeries may offer a specialized line of fèves depicting diverse themes from great works of art to classic movie stars and popular cartoon characters. The cakes are usually sold in special bags, some of which can be used to heat the cake in a microwave without ruining the crispness of the cake.  A paper crown is included with the cake to crown the &#34;king&#34; who finds the fève in their piece of cake.  To ensure a random distribution of the cake shares, it is traditional for the youngest person to place him- or herself under the table and name the recipient of the share which is indicated by the person in charge of the service.</p>
<p>Formerly, the cake was divided into as many shares as there were guests, plus one. The latter, called &#34;the share of God,&#34; &#34;share of the Virgin Mary,&#34; or &#34;share of the poor&#34; was intended for the first poor person to arrive at the home.</p>
