<p><b>Changua</b> (milk soup with eggs) is a typical hearty breakfast <a href="/Soup" title="Soup">soup</a> of the central <a href="/Andes" title="Andes">Andes</a> region of <a href="/Colombia" title="Colombia">Colombia</a>, in particular in the <a href="/Boyac%C3%A1_Department" title="Boyac치 Department">Boyac치</a> and <a href="/Cundinamarca_Department" title="Cundinamarca Department">Cundinamarca</a> area, including the capital, <a href="/Bogot%C3%A1" title="Bogot치">Bogot치</a>. The dish has <a href="/Chibcha" title="Chibcha">Chibcha</a> origins.</p>
<p>A mixture of equal amounts of water and milk is heated with a dash of salt. Once it comes to a boil, one <a href="/Egg_(food)" title="Egg (food)">egg</a> per serving is cracked into the pot without breaking the <a href="/Egg_yolk" title="Egg yolk">yolk</a>, and allowed to cook for about a minute whilst covered. The soup is served in a bowl, garnished with <a href="/Scallion" title="Scallion">scallions</a>, which may be fried beforehand but usually are not, curly <a href="/Cilantro" title="Cilantro">cilantro</a>, and a piece of <a href="/Staling" title="Staling">stale bread</a> called &#34;calado&#34; which softens in the changua. It is sometimes served with pieces of cheese which melt into the soup.</p>
<p>Modern versions of &#34;Changua&#34; include chicken stock instead of water, tomato concassee, chopped cilantro and &#34;Choclo&#34; Arepas.</p>
