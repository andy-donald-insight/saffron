A typical Swedish recipe for nettle soup involves first blanching the nettles, and then straining them from the liquid. The liquid is then strained again to remove the dirt (pieces of sand or gravel) from it. Then a <a href="/Roux" title="Roux">roux</a> is made, with butter and flour, onto which the &#34;nettle water&#34; (the water in which the nettles were blanched) is poured. The nettles are chopped very finely, or puréed, together with the other ingredients, which typically include <a href="/Chives" title="Chives">chives</a> (or <a href="/Ramson" title="Ramson">ramson</a> or <a href="/Garlic" title="Garlic">garlic</a>), and <a href="/Chervil" title="Chervil">chervil</a> or <a href="/Fennel" title="Fennel">fennel</a>. The chopped or puréed nettles and herbs are then put into the nettle water, brought to a boil, and then left to simmer for a few minutes. Some recipes call for discarding the nettle water and replacing it with <a href="/Chicken" title="Chicken">chicken stock</a> or lamb stock, but according to others{{cn||date=July 2013}} this way of making the soup takes away the natural taste of the nettles. The soup is commonly served with sliced boiled eggs, and occasionally with poached eggs.
Typically some broth is added as the nettles have very little taste by themselves.</p>
