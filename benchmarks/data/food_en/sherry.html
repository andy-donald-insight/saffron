<p><b>Sherry</b> ({{IPAc-en|lang|ˈ|ʃ|ɛr|i}}, {{lang-es|Jerez}} {{IPA-es|xeˈɾeθ|}} or {{IPA-es|xeˈɾes|}}) is a <a href="/Fortified_wine" title="Fortified wine">fortified wine</a> made from white grapes that are grown near the town of <a href="/Jerez_de_la_Frontera" title="Jerez de la Frontera">Jerez de la Frontera</a> in <a href="/Andalusia" title="Andalusia">Andalusia</a>, <a href="/Spain" title="Spain">Spain</a>. Sherry is produced in a variety of styles made primarily from the <a href="/Palomino_(grape)" title="Palomino (grape)">Palomino</a> grape, ranging from light versions similar to white table wines, such as <a href="/Manzanilla_(wine)" title="Manzanilla (wine)">Manzanilla</a> and <a href="/Fino" title="Fino">Fino</a>, to darker and heavier versions that have been allowed to oxidise as they age in barrel, such as <a href="/Amontillado" title="Amontillado">Amontillado</a> and <a href="/Oloroso" title="Oloroso">Oloroso</a>. Sweet <a href="/Dessert_wine" title="Dessert wine">dessert wines</a> are also made from <a href="/Pedro_Ximenez" title="Pedro Ximenez">Pedro Ximenez</a> or <a href="/Moscatel" title="Moscatel">Moscatel</a> grapes, and are sometimes blended with Palomino-based Sherries.</p>
<p>The word &#34;Sherry&#34; is an <a href="/Anglicisation" title="Anglicisation">anglicisation</a> of Xeres (Jerez).

In 1933 the Jerez <i><a href="/Denominaci%C3%B3n_de_Origen" title="Denominación de Origen">Denominación de Origen</a></i> was the first Spanish <i>denominación</i> to be officially recognised in this way, officially named <i>D.O.

JEREZ, MANZANILLA Y VINAGRE DE JEREZ|publisher=|accessdate=10 January 2015}}&#60;/ref&#62; Wines classified as suitable for aging as Fino and Manzanilla are fortified until they reach a total alcohol content of 15.5 per cent by volume. As they age in barrel, they develop a layer of <a href="/Flor" title="Flor">flor</a>—a yeast-like growth that helps protect the wine from excessive oxidation. Those wines that are classified to undergo aging as Oloroso are fortified to reach an alcohol content of at least 17 per cent. They do not develop flor and so oxidise slightly as they age, giving them a darker colour. Because the fortification takes place after fermentation, most sherries are initially dry, with any sweetness being added later. In contrast, <a href="/Port_wine" title="Port wine">port wine</a> is fortified halfway through its fermentation, which stops the process so that not all of the sugar is turned into alcohol.</p>
<p>Wines from different years are aged and blended using a <a href="/Solera" title="Solera">solera</a> system before bottling, so that bottles of sherry will not usually carry a specific vintage year and can contain a small proportion of very old wine.

<p>Jerez has been a centre of <a href="/Viniculture" title="Viniculture">viniculture</a> since wine-making was introduced to Spain by the <a href="/Phoenicians" title="Phoenicians">Phoenicians</a> in 1100 BC. The practice was carried on by the <a href="/Ancient_Rome" title="Ancient Rome">Romans</a> when they took control of Iberia around 200 BC. The <a href="/Moors" title="Moors">Moors</a> conquered the region in AD 711 and introduced <a href="/Distillation" title="Distillation">distillation</a>, which led to the development of brandy and fortified wine.</p>
<p>During the <a href="/Moors" title="Moors">Moorish</a> period, the town was called <i>Sherish</i> (a transliteration of the <a href="/Arabic_language" title="Arabic language">Arabic</a> <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D8%B4%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%B4">شريش</a>), from which both <i>Sherry</i> and <i>Jerez</i> are derived. Wines similar in style to Sherry have traditionally been made in the city of <a href="/Shiraz" title="Shiraz">Shiraz</a> in mid-southern Iran, but it is thought unlikely that the name derives from there.&#60;ref&#62;Maclean, Fitzroy. <i>Eastern Approaches</i>.

<p>Wine production continued through five centuries of Arab Empire&#39;s rule. In 966, <a href="/Al-Hakam_II" title="Al-Hakam II">Al-Hakam II</a>, the second <a href="/Caliphate_of_C%C3%B3rdoba" title="Caliphate of Córdoba">Caliph of Córdoba</a>, ordered the destruction of the vineyards, but the inhabitants of Jerez appealed on the grounds that the vineyards also produced raisins to feed the empire&#39;s soldiers, and the Caliph spared two-thirds of the vineyards.</p>
<p>In 1264 <a href="/Alfonso_X_of_Castile" title="Alfonso X of Castile">Alfonso X of Castile</a> took the city. From this point on, the production of sherry and its export throughout Europe increased significantly. By the end of the 16th century, sherry had a reputation in Europe as the world&#39;s finest wine.</p>
<p><a href="/Christopher_Columbus" title="Christopher Columbus">Christopher Columbus</a> brought sherry on his voyage to the New World and when <a href="/Ferdinand_Magellan" title="Ferdinand Magellan">Ferdinand Magellan</a> prepared to sail around the world in 1519, he spent more on sherry than on weapons.</p>
<p>Sherry became very popular in Great Britain, especially after <a href="/Francis_Drake" title="Francis Drake">Francis Drake</a> sacked Cadiz in 1587. At that time Cadiz was one of the most important Spanish seaports, and Spain was preparing an armada there to invade England. Among the spoils Drake brought back after destroying the fleet were 2,900 barrels of sherry that had been waiting to be loaded aboard Spanish ships.&#60;ref name=&#34;The Story of Wine&#34;&#62;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=Hugh|title=The story of wine|year=2005|publisher=Octopus Publishing Group|location=London|isbn=978-1-84000-972-9|edition=New illustrated}}&#60;/ref&#62; This helped to popularize Sherry in the British Isles.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.diariodejerez.es/article/jerez/847168/me/habre/bebido/majuelo.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.diariodejerez.es/article/jerez/847168/me/habre/bebido/majuelo.html</a>|title=&#39;Me habré bebido El Majuelo&#39;|author=Juan P.

<p>Because sherry was a major wine export to the <a href="/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, many English companies and styles developed. Many of the Jerez cellars were founded by British families.</p>
<p>In 1894 the Jerez region was devastated by the insect <a href="/Phylloxera" title="Phylloxera">phylloxera</a>.

<p>Spanish producers have registered the names <i>Jerez</i> / <i>Xérès</i> / <i>Sherry</i> and will prosecute producers of similar fortified wines from other places using the same name. In 1933, Article 34 of the Spanish <i>Estatuto del Vino</i> (Wine Law) established the boundaries of sherry production as the first <a href="/Spanish_wine" title="Spanish wine">Spanish wine</a> <i>denominación</i>.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Climate">Climate</span></h3>
<p>The Jerez district has a predictable climate, with approximately 70 days of rainfall and almost 300 days of sun per year. The rain mostly falls between the months of October and May, averaging 600 l/m². The summer is dry and hot, with temperatures as high as 40&#38;nbsp;°C (104&#38;nbsp;°F), but winds from the ocean bring moisture to the vineyards in the early morning and the clays in the soil retain water below the surface. The average temperature across the year is approximately 18&#38;nbsp;°C (64&#38;nbsp;°F).</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Soil">Soil</span></h3>
<p>There are three <a href="/List_of_vineyard_soils" title="List of vineyard soils">types of soil</a> in the Jerez district for growing the grapes for Sherry:&#60;ref name=&#34;MacNeil pg 438&#34;&#62;K. MacNeil <i>The Wine Bible</i> pg 438 Workman Publishing 2001 <a class="external text" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1563054345" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1563054345">ISBN 1-56305-434-5</a>&#60;/ref&#62;
</p>
<ul>
<li><i><a href="/Albariza" title="Albariza">Albariza</a></i>: the lightest soil, almost white, and best for growing Palomino grapes. It is approximately 40–50 percent chalk, the rest being a blend of limestone, clay and sand. Albariza preserves moisture well during the hot summer months.</li>
<li><i>Barros</i>: a dark brown soil, 10 percent chalk with a high clay content.</li>
<li><i>Arenas</i>: a yellowish soil, also 10 percent chalk but with a high sand content.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <i>albariza</i> soil is the best for growing the Palomino grape, and by law 40 percent of the grapes making up a sherry must come from <i>albariza</i> soil. The <i>barros</i> and <i>arenas</i> soil are mostly used for Pedro Ximénez and Moscatel grapes.</p>
<p>The benefits of the <i>albariza</i> soil is that it can reflect sunlight back up to the vine, aiding it in <a href="/Photosynthesis" title="Photosynthesis">photosynthesis</a>. The nature of the soil is very absorbent and compact so that it can retain and maximize the use of the little rainfall that the Jerez region receives.&#60;ref name=&#34;MacNeil pg 438&#34;/&#62;</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Grapes">Grapes</span></h3>
<p>Before the <a href="/Phylloxera" title="Phylloxera">phylloxera</a> infestation in 1894, there were estimated to be over one hundred varieties of grape used in Spain for the production of sherry,&#60;ref&#62;T. Stevenson, ed. <i>The Sotheby&#39;s Wine Encyclopedia</i> (3rd Edition)&#60;/ref&#62; but now there are only three white grapes grown for sherry-making:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/Palomino_(grape)" title="Palomino (grape)">Palomino</a>: the dominant grape used for the dry sherries. Approximately 90 per cent of the grapes grown for sherry are Palomino. As <a href="/Varietal" title="Varietal">varietal</a> <a href="/Table_wine" title="Table wine">table wine</a>, the Palomino grape produces a wine of very bland and neutral characteristics. This neutrality is actually what makes Palomino an ideal grape because it is easily enhanced by the sherry winemaking style.&#60;ref name=&#34;MacNeil pg 438&#34;/&#62;</li>
<li><a href="/Pedro_Xim%C3%A9nez" title="Pedro Ximénez">Pedro Ximénez</a>: used to produce sweet wines. When harvested these grapes are typically dried in the sun for two days to concentrate their sugars.</li>
<li><a href="/Muscat_(grape_and_wine)" title="Muscat (grape and wine)">Moscatel</a>: used similarly to Pedro Ximénez, but it is less common.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sherry-style wines made in other countries often use other grape varieties.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Fermentation">Fermentation</span></h3>
<p>The Palomino grapes are harvested in early September, and <a href="/Pressed_(wine)" title="Pressed (wine)">pressed</a> lightly to extract the <a href="/Must" title="Must">must</a>. The must from the first pressing, the <i>primera yema</i>, is used to produce Fino and Manzanilla and the must from the second pressing, the <i>segunda yema</i> will be used for Oloroso ; the product of additional pressings is used for lesser wines, distillation and <a href="/Sherry_vinegar" title="Sherry vinegar">vinegar</a>. The must is then fermented in stainless steel vats until the end of November, producing a dry white wine with 11–12 percent alcohol content.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Fortification">Fortification</span></h3>
<p>Immediately after fermentation, the wine is sampled and the first classification is performed. The casks are marked with the following symbols according to the potential of the wine:
</p>
<div style="page-break-inside: avoid;">
<table border="&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;" cellpadding="&amp;quot;2&amp;quot;">
<tr>
<th>/</th>
<td>a single stroke indicates a wine with the finest flavour and aroma, suitable for Fino or Amontillado. These wines are fortified to about 15 percent alcohol to allow the growth of flor.</td></tr>
<tr>
<th>/.</th>
<td>a single stroke with a dot indicates a heavier, more full-bodied wine. These wines are fortified to about 17.5 percent alcohol to prevent the growth of flor, and the wines are aged oxidatively to produce Oloroso.</td></tr>
<tr>
<th>//</th>
<td>a double stroke indicates a wine which will be allowed to develop further before determining whether to use the wine for Amontillado or Oloroso. These wines are fortified to about 15 percent alcohol.</td></tr>
<tr>
<th>///</th>
<td>a triple stroke indicates a wine that has developed poorly, and will be <a href="/Distillation" title="Distillation">distilled</a>.</td></tr></table></div>

<p>The sherry is <a href="/Fortified_wine" title="Fortified wine">fortified</a> using <i>destilado</i>, made by distilling wine, usually from <a href="/La_Mancha" title="La Mancha">La Mancha</a>. The distilled spirit is first mixed with mature sherry to make a 50/50 blend known as <i>mitad y mitad</i> (half and half), and then the <i>mitad y mitad</i> is mixed with the younger sherry to the proper proportions. This two-stage procedure is performed so the strong alcohol will not shock the young sherry and spoil it.</p>

<p>The fortified wine is stored in 500-litre casks that are made of North American <a href="/Oak_(wine)" title="Oak (wine)">oak</a>, which is less porous than French or Spanish oak. The casks, or <i>butts</i>, are filled five-sixths full, leaving &#34;the space of two fists&#34; empty at the top to allow <a href="/Flor" title="Flor">flor</a> to develop on top of the wine.</p>
<p>Sherry is then aged in the <a href="/Solera" title="Solera">solera</a> system where new wine is put into <a href="/Wine_barrel" title="Wine barrel">wine barrels</a> at the beginning of a series of three to nine barrels. Periodically, a portion of the wine in a barrel is moved into the next barrel down, using tools called the <i>canoa</i> (canoe) and <i>rociador</i> (sprinkler) to move the wine gently and avoid damaging the layer of flor in each barrel. At the end of the series only a portion of the final barrel is bottled and sold. Depending on the type of wine, the portion moved may be between five and thirty percent of each barrel. This process is called &#34;running the scales&#34; because each barrel in the series is called a scale. Thus, the age of the youngest wine going in the bottle is determined by the number of barrels in the series, and every bottle also contains some much older wine than is stated. Sherry is aged in the solera for a minimum of three years.</p>
<p>Old sherry butts are sold to the <a href="/Scotch_whisky" title="Scotch whisky">Scotch whisky</a> industry for use in aging <a href="/Whisky" title="Whisky">whisky</a>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Storing_and_drinking">Storing and drinking</span></h2>
<p>Once bottled, sherry does not generally benefit from further aging and may be consumed immediately, though the sherries that have been aged oxidatively may be stored for years without noticeable loss in flavour. Bottles should be stored upright to minimize the wine&#39;s exposed surface area. As with other wines, Sherry should be stored in a cool, dark place. The best fino sherries which have been aged for longer than normal prior to bottling, such as Manzanilla Pasada, will continue to develop in the bottle for some years.</p>
<p>Fino and Manzanilla are the most fragile types of Sherry and should usually be drunk soon after opening in the same way as unfortified wines. In Spain, Finos are often sold in half bottles, with any remaining wine being thrown out if it is not drunk the same day it is opened.&#60;ref name=&#34;MacNeil pg 447&#34;&#62;K.

<p>Sherry is traditionally drunk from a <i><a href="/Sherry_glass" title="Sherry glass">copita</a></i>, a special tulip-shaped sherry glass. Sampling wine directly from a sherry butt may be performed with characteristic flourish by a <i>venenciador</i>, named after the special cup (the <i><a href="/Venencia" title="Venencia">venencia</a></i>) traditionally made of <a href="/Silver" title="Silver">silver</a> and fastened to a long whale whisker handle. The cup, narrow enough to pass though the <a href="/Bung_hole" title="Bung hole">bung hole</a>, withdraws a measure of sherry which is then ceremoniously poured from head height into a <i>copita</i> held in the other hand.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=3EH_dVAApBMC&#38;pg=PA214&#38;dq=venenciador+taste&#38;lr=&#38;ei=CoCCSrTIGoPqkwTNnIGRCg&#38;client=safari#v=onepage&#38;q=venenciador%20taste&#38;f=false" rel="nofollow">Sales and Service for the Wine Professional</a>&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
