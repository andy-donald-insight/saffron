Dal-baati-churma is a complete dish. Dal Baati is a popular Rajasthani dish consisting of mainly Uradh Dal (50% Uradh and rest Chana and Moong) and Baati i.e. small wheat bread balls. Baati is dipped in pure ghee and served hot in a traditional earthen pot. Dal is served in a small bucket shaped vessel with a red chilli tadka on top, spicy garlic chutney, or with besan (gram flour).&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|title=Dal-Bati-Churma: A Rajasthani Delight|url=<a class="external free" href="http://indiacanteen.tastyfix.com/dal-bati-churma-a-rajasthani-delight/" rel="nofollow">http://indiacanteen.tastyfix.com/dal-bati-churma-a-rajasthani-delight/</a>|website=<a class="external free" href="http://tastyfix.com" rel="nofollow">http://tastyfix.com</a>}}&#60;/ref&#62;

In Madhya Pradesh, you will see Dall-Baati being served with other dishes as well for example, Bharrta (Cooked on direct flames and mashed with raw spices) or fried potatoes. Kadhi (cooked with Besan (gram flour) and butter milk) is also eaten with Daal-Baati as it adds the liquid element in the whole combination. Baati, as made up of different kinds of flours, makes you thirsty. To maintain the water content in the whole combination Kadhi is also eaten with Daal-Baati.</p>
<p>Gatte ki Sabzi, made up of Besan (gram flour) and spices, is also eaten in western Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. It is little bit spicier so added the element of spices to the whole thali.</p>
<p>Mango Pickle and Green Chutney ( made with coriander, lemon, tomatoes, rock salt, cumin seeds and sea salt) are integral part of the thali. In western Madhya Pradesh towards Malwa, sweet rice is also cooked and served in the Thali. The rice is cooked with saffron, sugar and cloves.</p>
