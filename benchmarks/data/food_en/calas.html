<b>The Canadian Association for Laboratory Animal Science</b> (<b>CALAS</b>), a <a href="/Not-for-profit" title="Not-for-profit">not-for-profit</a> membership association was formed in 1962 with a vision to elevate the standards of laboratory animal science and to enhance animal well-being. They embarked on a goal to work towards the elimination of inhumane and unnecessary use of animals in research. The CALAS mission is to advance the knowledge, skills and status of those who care for and use laboratory animals, to improve the standards of animal care in research and to provide a forum for the exchange and dissemination of knowledge regarding care and research.</p>
<p>CALAS has 900 members, being veterinarians, physicians, researchers, administrators and technicians. The national office is located in Toronto, Ontario.<a class="external text" href="http://www.calas-acsal.org/index.php?option=com_content&#38;task=view&#38;id=12&#38;Itemid=34" rel="nofollow"><a class="external free" href="http://www.calas-acsal.org/index.php?option=com_content&#38;task=view&#38;id=12&#38;Itemid=34" rel="nofollow">http://www.calas-acsal.org/index.php?option=com_content&#38;task=view&#38;id=12&#38;Itemid=34</a></a>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Annual_symposium">Annual symposium</span></h2>
<p>Each spring since 1962, CALAS has held a national Symposium. The CALAS Symposium is a networking and educational event for the <a href="/Laboratory_animal_science" title="Laboratory animal science">laboratory animal science</a> community in Canada. It brings members and non-members together for four days of knowledge building <a href="/Workshops" title="Workshops">workshops</a>, discussions, demonstrations and networking.</p>
<p>Eleven professional and technical <a href="/Awards" title="Awards">awards</a> for recognition in the field of laboratory animal science are presented each year at the symposium. The symposium is the only laboratory animal <a href="/Academic_conference" title="Academic conference">conference</a> held each year in Canada and attracts more than 400 members from the industry.<a class="external autonumber" href="http://symposium.calas-acsal.org/ContentPage.aspx?name=CALAS-ACSAL" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Publications">Publications</span></h2>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Registered_Technicians">Registered Technicians</span></h3>
<p>A Registered Laboratory Animal Technician has an animal science education, training in the care and use of laboratory animals and on the job practical experience.</p>
<p><b>Associate Registered Laboratory Animal Technician   </b> 
These individuals have several years of experience in the field and an interest in continuing their education. An ARLAT is trained for the care and use of laboratory animals.</p>
<p><b>Registered Laboratory Animal Technician  </b> 
The Registered Laboratory Animal Technician (RLAT) and Registered Laboratory Animal Technician (Research) (RLAT(R)) are equivalent designations. The designations represent two streams rather than levels. The RLAT is employed by an animal facility, they have an animal science education, training in the care and use of laboratory animals and on the job practical experience. Continued development of this expertise enables him/her to obtain the knowledge base and practical competency required to meet the high standards set by the CALAS Registry examinations</p>
<p><b>RLAT(R): Registered Laboratory Animal Technician (Research)</b>  
The RLAT(R) typically works for one researcher as opposed to being employed by an animal facility. This person is very focused in one area of research and usually works with only one or two species of animals.  The person has in depth knowledge about their research project and the  animal species they are working with.  Their knowledge includes understanding how <a href="/Animal_husbandry" title="Animal husbandry">animal husbandry</a>, the <a href="/Natural_environment" title="Natural environment">environment</a>, and the operation of an animal facility affect their research.</p>
<p><b>RMLAT: Registered Master Laboratory Animal Technician</b>    
The Master’s achievement is the highest level of Registration. Successful candidates possess a knowledge of most laboratory animal species, their care, management and use in research. Typically RMLAT&#39;s are in supervisory positions or are candidates for such positions. They are able to compile facts, analyze the consequences of different approaches to any given animal research related problem and apply their knowledge in problem-solving and decision-making situations.</p>
<p><b>RMLAT(R): Registered Master Laboratory Animal Technician (Research)</b>
The background is similar to the RMLAT Registration but is applied to those individuals who have been involved primarily with specific laboratory animal species and projects. The individual has a laboratory animal science knowledge base enabling them to be a major contributor to a successful research program. They will be well versed in the <a href="/Anatomy" title="Anatomy">anatomy</a>, <a href="/Physiology" title="Physiology">physiology</a>, <a href="/Diseases" title="Diseases">diseases</a> and needs of the animal species they work with.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Continuing_education">Continuing education</span></h2>
<p>Registered members must earn 10 continuing education (CE) credits per calendar year. CALAS continuing education credits are based on CALAS events. CALAS encourages education from other associations such as LAMA, CAAHTT, AALAS, etc.<a class="external text" href="http://www.calas-acsal.org/index.php?option=com_content&#38;task=view&#38;id=21&#38;Itemid=47" rel="nofollow"><a class="external free" href="http://www.calas-acsal.org/index.php?option=com_content&#38;task=view&#38;id=21&#38;Itemid=47" rel="nofollow">http://www.calas-acsal.org/index.php?option=com_content&#38;task=view&#38;id=21&#38;Itemid=47</a></a></p>
