<p>Schupfnudeln have been known as a trooper dish since the <a href="/Thirty_Years&#39;_War" title="Thirty Years&#39; War">Thirty Years&#39; War</a>: out of their daily <a href="/Flour" title="Flour">flour</a> ration and water the soldiers formed long noodles, which they cooked afterwards. After the potato was imported to and cultivated in Germany in the 17th century, the recipe was modified and different variations emerged according to different regions.</p>

<p>Though they can be found throughout Germany, they are especially popular in the cuisine of <a href="/Baden" title="Baden">Baden</a> and <a href="/Swabia" title="Swabia">Swabia</a>. There in addition to Schupfnudeln they are called <i>Baunzen</i> or even <i>Bubenspitzle</i> (literally little boys&#39; <a href="/Human_penis" title="Human penis">willies</a>).</p>
<p>In <a href="/Bavarian_cuisine" title="Bavarian cuisine">Bavarian cuisine</a> they are known as <i>Fingernudeln</i> (finger noodles), <i>Dradewixpfeiferl</i>, Kartoffel- or <i>Erdepfebaunkerl</i> (potato <i>Baunkerl</i>) or <i>Schupfnudeln</i>, and in <a href="/Upper_Palatinate" title="Upper Palatinate">Upper Palatinate</a> they are called <i>Schopperla</i> or <i>Schoppala</i>.</p>
<p>In the <a href="/Odenwald" title="Odenwald">Odenwald</a> their name is <i>Krautnudeln</i> (<a href="/Cabbage" title="Cabbage">cabbage</a> noodles) and in the <a href="/Palatinate_(region)" title="Palatinate (region)">Palatinate</a> they are called <i>Buwespitzle</i>. The <i>Bauchstecherla</i> in <a href="/Franconia" title="Franconia">Franconia</a> are a bit thinner and more pointed.</p>
<p>A special variety of these noodles is called <i><a href="/Mohnnudel" title="Mohnnudel">Mohnnudeln</a></i> (poppy seed noodles) and can be found throughout <a href="/Bavaria" title="Bavaria">Bavaria</a> and <a href="/Austria" title="Austria">Austria</a>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Preparation">Preparation</span></h2>

<p>The name <i>Schupf</i>- or <i>Fingernudel</i> refers to the form and shape of the noodle and not to the ingredients. There is no universally authentic recipe but many widely different ways of preparation according to region. Many of these variations claim to be the original and authentic <i>Schupfnudeln</i>.</p>
<p>This disagreement about method is reflected in the subject literature. The <a href="/Duden" title="Duden">Duden</a> (reference book of German language) says that the <i>Schupfnudel</i> is a fried dish while Ludwig Zehetner writes in his Bavarian Dictionary that one should boil it in salt water.</p>
<p>Simple recipes only use rye flour and water for the <a href="/Dough" title="Dough">dough</a>, but many recipes include mashed potatoes, <a href="/Wheat" title="Wheat">wheat</a> flour and egg. The dough is kneaded and then rolled into a long, thin cylinder. This roll is cut into pieces about half an inch in width. These are rolled the typical shape of Schupfnudeln. Afterwards they are either cooked in salty water for about ten minutes or deep-fried. Many recipes include frying them in a pan afterwards as well.</p>
<p>Subsequently they are served in different ways: savory with <a href="/Salvia" title="Salvia">sage</a>-butter or <a href="/Sauerkraut" title="Sauerkraut">sauerkraut</a> or sweet with poppy seeds, <a href="/Sugar" title="Sugar">sugar</a> and <a href="/Cinnamon" title="Cinnamon">cinnamon</a>. In all cases it is necessary that the comparatively flavorless noodles incorporate the flavor of the other ingredients. Schupfnudeln can be served either as a side dish or as a main dish.</p>

<p>Schupfnudeln <a href="/Pan-frying" title="Pan-frying">pan-fried</a> with <a href="/Bacon" title="Bacon">bacon</a> bits and sauerkraut are commonly served at public <a href="/Wine_festival" title="Wine festival">wine festivals</a> throughout Baden and Swabia. In Swabia, Schupfnudeln are often served with cold fruits, like cold stewed apples or pears.</p>
