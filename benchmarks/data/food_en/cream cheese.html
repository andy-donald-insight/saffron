<p>Recipes for cream cheese can be found in <a href="/US" title="US">US</a> cookbooks and newspapers beginning in the mid-eighteenth century.  By the 1820s, the dairy farms in and around <a href="/Philadelphia" title="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> had gained a reputation for producing the best examples of this cheese.  Cream cheese was produced on family farms throughout the country, so quantities made and distributed were typically small.   Around 1873, William A. Lawrence, a  Chester, NY, dairyman, was the first to mass-produce cream cheese.   In 1873 he purchased a <a href="/Neufch%C3%A2tel_cheese" title="Neufchâtel cheese">Neufchatel</a> factory and shortly thereafter, by adding cream to the process, was able to create a richer cheese, that he called “cream cheese”.&#60;ref&#62;The story, found in numerous cheese histories, that Lawrence “accidentally” made cream cheese or had stolen the recipe from another Chester, dairyman, Charles Green, is a fabrication. Jeffrey A. Marx, &#34;The Days Had Come of Curds and Cream&#34;: The Origins and Development of Cream Cheese in America, in <i>Journal of Food, Culture and Society</i>, Vol. 15, Issue 2, June 2012.&#60;/ref&#62; In 1877 he created the first brand of cream cheese: its logo was a silhouette of a cow followed by the words: Neufchatel &#38; Cream Cheese. In 1879, in order to create a larger factory, Lawrence entered into a partnership with another Chester merchant, Samuel S. Durland.&#60;ref&#62;Marx (2012).&#60;/ref&#62; In 1880, Alvah L Reynolds, a New York cheese distributor, began to sell the cheese of Lawrence &#38; Durland and called it &#34;Philadelphia Cream Cheese&#34;.&#60;ref&#62;Histories that imply the cheese was produced in Philadelphia, PA, or Philadelphia, NY, are incorrect. Marx (2012); International Cheese Company v. Phoenix Cheese Company (1906).&#60;/ref&#62; By the end of 1880, faced with increasing demand for his Philadelphia-brand cheese, Reynolds turned to Charles Green, a second Chester dairyman, who by 1880 had been manufacturing cream cheese as well.  Some of Green’s cheese was now also sold under the Philadelphia label.  In 1892, Reynolds bought the Empire Cheese Co. of South Edmeston, NY, to produce cheese under his &#34;Philadelphia&#34; label.  When the Empire factory burned down in 1900, he asked the newly formed Phoenix Cheese Company to produce his cheese instead. In 1903, Reynolds sold rights to the &#34;Philadelphia&#34; brand name to Phoenix Cheese Company under the direction of Jason F. Whitney, Sr. (which merged with Kraft in 1928).&#60;ref&#62;Marx (2012); International Cheese Company v. Phenix Cheese Company (1906).&#60;/ref&#62; By the early 1880s, Star cream cheese had emerged as Lawrence &#38; Durland&#39;s brand and Green’s made World and Globe brands of the cheese.  At the turn of the 20th century, New York dairymen were producing cream cheese for a number of other brands as well: Double Cream (C. Percival); Eagle (F.X. Baumert); Empire (Phenix Cheese Co.); Mohican (International Cheese Co.); Monroe Cheese Co. (Gross &#38; Hoffman); and Nabob (F.H. Legget).&#60;ref&#62; Marx (2012); W.A. Lawrence et al v. P. E. Sharpless Co. (1912); International Cheese Company v. Phenix Cheese Company (1906).&#60;/ref&#62;</p>

Cream cheese is often spread on <a href="/Bread" title="Bread">bread</a>, <a href="/Bagel" title="Bagel">bagels</a>, <a href="/Cracker_(food)" title="Cracker (food)">crackers</a>, etc., and used as a dip for <a href="/Potato_chips" title="Potato chips">potato chips</a> and similar snack items, and in salads. It can be mixed with other ingredients to make spreads, such as yogurt-cream spread (1.25 parts cream cheese, 1 part yogurt, whipped).</p>
<p>Cream cheese can be used for many purposes in sweet and savoury cookery, and is in the same family of ingredients as other milk products, such as cream, milk, butter, and yogurt. It can be used in cooking to make <a href="/Cheesecake" title="Cheesecake">cheesecake</a> and to thicken sauces and make them creamy. Cream cheese is sometimes used in place of or with <a href="/Butter" title="Butter">butter</a> (typically two parts cream cheese to one part butter) when making <a href="/Cake" title="Cake">cakes</a> or <a href="/Cookie" title="Cookie">cookies</a>, and cream cheese frosting. It is the main ingredient in the filling of <a href="/Crab_rangoon" title="Crab rangoon">crab rangoon</a>, an appetizer commonly served at <a href="/American_Chinese_cuisine" title="American Chinese cuisine">US Chinese restaurants</a>. It can also be used instead of butter or olive oil in <a href="/Mashed_potato" title="Mashed potato">mashed potatoes</a>. It is also commonly used in some western-style sushi rolls.</p>
<p>American cream cheese tends to have lower fat content than elsewhere, but &#34;Philadelphia&#34; branded cheese is sometimes suggested as a substitute for <i><a href="/Petit_suisse" title="Petit suisse">petit suisse</a></i>.&#60;ref&#62;Julia Child, <i>Mastering the Art of French Cooking</i>&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
