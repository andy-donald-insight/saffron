<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Rings">Rings</span></h3>
<p>Ring doughnuts are formed by joining the ends of a long, skinny piece of dough into a ring or by using a doughnut cutter, which simultaneously cuts the outside and inside shape, leaving a doughnut-shaped piece of dough and a doughnut hole from dough removed from the center. This smaller piece of dough can be cooked or added back to the batch to make more doughnuts. A disk-shaped doughnut can also be stretched and pinched into a <a href="/Torus" title="Torus">torus</a> until the center breaks to form a hole. Alternatively, a doughnut depositor can be used to place a circle of liquid dough (batter) directly into the fryer.</p>
<p>There are two types of ring doughnuts, those made from a yeast-based dough for raised doughnuts or made from a special type of cake batter. Yeast-raised doughnuts contain about 25% oil by weight, whereas cake doughnuts&#39; oil content is around 20%, but they have extra fat included in the batter before frying. Cake doughnuts are fried for about 90 seconds at approximately 190&#38;nbsp;°C (374&#38;nbsp;°F) to 198&#38;nbsp;°C (388&#38;nbsp;°F), turning once. <a href="/Yeast" title="Yeast">Yeast</a>-raised doughnuts absorb more oil because they take longer to fry, about 150 seconds, at 182&#38;nbsp;°C (359&#38;nbsp;°F) to 190&#38;nbsp;°C (374&#38;nbsp;°F). Cake doughnuts typically weigh between 24 g and 28 g (0.85 oz to 0.99 oz), whereas yeast-raised doughnuts average 38 g (1.34&#38;nbsp;oz) and are generally larger, and taller (due to rising) when finished.</p>

<p>
Doughnut holes are small, bite-sized doughnuts that were traditionally made from the dough taken from the center of ring doughnuts. Before long, doughnut sellers saw the opportunity to market &#34;holes&#34; as a novelty and many chains offer their own variety, some with their own brand names such as &#34;Munchkins&#34; from <a href="/Dunkin&#39;_Donuts" title="Dunkin&#39; Donuts">Dunkin&#39; Donuts</a> and &#34;<a href="/Timbits" title="Timbits">Timbits</a>&#34; from <a href="/Tim_Hortons" title="Tim Hortons">Tim Hortons</a>.</p>
<p>Traditionally, doughnut holes are made by frying the dough removed from the center portion of the doughnut. Consequently, they are considerably smaller than a standard doughnut and tend to be spherical. Similar to standard doughnuts, doughnut holes may be topped with confections, such as glaze or powdered sugar.</p>
<p>Originally, most varieties of doughnut holes were derivatives of their ring doughnut (yeast-based dough or cake batter) counterparts. However, doughnut holes can also be made by dropping a small ball of dough into hot oil from a specially shaped nozzle or cutter.&#60;ref name=&#34;Timbit turns 35&#34;&#62;{{cite web|title=Timbit turns 35|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.torontosun.com/2011/06/15/timbit-turns-35" rel="nofollow">http://www.torontosun.com/2011/06/15/timbit-turns-35</a>|accessdate=18 June 2014}}&#60;/ref&#62; This production method has allowed doughnut sellers to produce bite-sized versions of non-ring doughnuts, such as filled doughnuts, <a href="/Fritter" title="Fritter">fritters</a> and <a href="/Dutchie_(doughnut)" title="Dutchie (doughnut)">Dutchies</a>.</p>

Doughnuts have a disputed history.

<p>Hanson Gregory, an American, claimed to have invented the ring-shaped doughnut in 1847 aboard a lime-trading ship when he was only 16 years old. Gregory was dissatisfied with the greasiness of doughnuts twisted into various shapes and with the raw center of regular doughnuts. He claimed to have punched a hole in the center of dough with the ship&#39;s tin pepper box, and to have later taught the technique to his mother.&#60;ref&#62;&#34;&#39;Old Salt&#39; Doughnut hole inventor tells just how discovery was made and stomachs of earth saved.&#34; Special to <i>The Washington Post</i>; <i>The Washington Post</i> (1877–1954), Washington, D.C; March 26, 1916; p. ES9&#60;/ref&#62; <i>Smithsonian Magazine</i> states that his mother, Elizabeth Gregory, &#34;made a wicked deep-fried dough that cleverly used her son&#39;s spice cargo of nutmeg and cinnamon, along with lemon rind,&#34; and &#34;put hazelnuts or walnuts in the center, where the dough might not cook through&#34;, and called the food &#39;doughnuts&#39;.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/the-history-of-the-doughnut-150405177/" rel="nofollow">http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/the-history-of-the-doughnut-150405177/</a> |title=History, Travel, Arts, Science, People, Places &#38;#124; Smithsonian |publisher=Smithsonianmag.com |date= |accessdate=2015-06-10}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>According to anthropologist <a href="/Paul_R._Mullins" title="Paul R. Mullins">Paul R. Mullins</a>, the first cookbook mentioning doughnuts was an 1803 English volume which included doughnuts in an appendix of American recipes. By the mid-19th century, the doughnut looked and tasted like today’s doughnut, and was viewed as a thoroughly American food.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://newswise.com/articles/view/542787/" rel="nofollow">Glazed America: Anthropologist Examines Doughnut as Symbol of Consumer Culture</a> Newswise, Retrieved on July 22, 2008.&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>Another theory on their origin came to light in 2013, appearing to predate all previous claims, when a recipe for &#34;dow nuts&#34; was found in a book of recipes and domestic tips written in 1800 by the wife of Baron <a href="/Thomas_Dimsdale" title="Thomas Dimsdale">Thomas Dimsdale</a>,&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web |url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.hertfordshiremercury.co.uk/Mmmmdow-nuts-sweet-treat-traced-Hertford/story-22005999-detail/story.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.hertfordshiremercury.co.uk/Mmmmdow-nuts-sweet-treat-traced-Hertford/story-22005999-detail/story.html</a> |title=

Because of the difficulties of providing freshly baked goods from huts established in abandoned buildings near the front lines, the two Salvation Army volunteers (Ensign Margaret Sheldon and Adjutant Helen Purviance) came up with the idea of providing doughnuts. These are reported to have been an &#34;instant hit&#34;, and &#34;soon many soldiers were visiting The Salvation Army huts&#34;.

Local varieties of doughnuts sold by peddlers and street vendors throughout the Philippines are usually made of plain well-kneaded dough, deep-fried in refined coconut oil and sprinkled with refined (not powdered or confectioner&#39;s) sugar. Doughnuts are a popular mid-day snack. A native variant from the <a href="/Visayas" title="Visayas">Visayas</a> islands known as <i>shakoy</i> or <i>siyakoy</i> (also known as <i>lubid-lubid</i> in the northern Philippines) uses a length of dough twisted into a distinctive rope-like shape before being fried.

The texture can range from soft and fluffy, to sticky and chewy, to hard and crunchy.

In <a href="/Spain" title="Spain">Spain</a>, there are two different types of doughnuts. The first one, simply called &#34;donuts&#34; (in reference to the most famous commercial brand name for this type of food) or &#34;berlinas&#34; (a more traditional name), refer to the American-style doughnut, that is, a deep fried, sweet, soft, ring of flour dough.</p>
<p>The second type of doughnut is a traditional pastry called &#34;<i>rosquilla</i>&#34;, made of fermented dough and which is fried or baked in an oven. They were purportedly introduced in Spain by the <a href="/Roman_Empire" title="Roman Empire">Romans</a>.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} In Spain, there are several variants of them depending on the region where they are prepared and on the time of the year they are sold, as they are regarded in some parts as a pastry especially prepared only for Easter. Although overall they result in pastries of a tighter texture and less sugared than American doughnuts, they differ greatly in shape, size and taste from one region to another.</p>
<p>The &#39;<a href="/Churro" title="Churro">churro</a>&#39; is a sweet pastry of deep-fried dough similar to a doughnut but shaped as a long, thin, ribbed cylinder rather than a ring or sphere. Churros are commonly served dusted in sugar as a snack or with a cup of hot chocolate.</p>
