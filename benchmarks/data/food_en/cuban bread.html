<p>The bakery was destroyed by fire in 1922, leaving only the brick bread oven standing.

It is not amiss to say that the Latins in Ybor City make a very fine bread, equal in all respects to the French article of that kind and unexcelled by the Vienna product.</p>

<p>A traditional loaf of Cuban bread is approximately three feet long and somewhat rectangular crossways (as compared to the rounder shape of Italian or French bread loaves). It has a hard, thin, almost papery toasted crust and a soft flaky center
.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.bread-maker.net/Bread-Types/Cuban-Bread.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.bread-maker.net/Bread-Types/Cuban-Bread.htm</a> |title=Cuban Bread: A History |publisher=Bread-maker.net |date= |accessdate=2008-12-22}}&#60;/ref&#62; In the early days, the dough was stretched thin to make it last, creating the bread&#39;s distinctive air pockets and long shape. As they have for decades, La Segunda and other traditional Cuban bread makers lay a long, moist <a href="/Arecaceae" title="Arecaceae">palm</a> <a href="/Frond" title="Frond">frond</a> on top of the loaves before baking, creating a shallow trench in the upper crust, producing an effect similar to the slashing of a European-style loaf.

<p>Cuban bread should be eaten soon after baking, as it tends to go <a href="/Staling" title="Staling">stale</a> quickly.
