<b>Matnakash</b> ({{lang-hy|<a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D5%B4%D5%A1%D5%BF%D5%B6%D5%A1%D6%84%D5%A1%D5%B7">մատնաքաշ</a>}}) is a leavened traditional <a href="/Armenia" title="Armenia">Armenian</a> bread, similar to the naan. The word <i>matnakash</i> literally means &#34;finger draw&#34; or &#34;finger pull&#34;, referring to the way the bread is prepared. It is made of <a href="/Wheat_flour" title="Wheat flour">wheat flour</a> with <a href="/Baker&#39;s_yeast" title="Baker&#39;s yeast">yeast</a> or <a href="/Sourdough_starter" title="Sourdough starter">sourdough starter</a>. It is shaped into oval or round loaves with longitudinal or criss-crossed scoring. The characteristic golden or golden-brown color of its crust is achieved by coating the surface of the loaves with sweetened tea essence before baking.&#60;ref&#62;<i>Matnakash</i> recipe on <a class="external text" href="http://www.armenia.ee/Cocking/Hac_html/H002.htm" rel="nofollow">Armenian Portal in Estonia</a>. {{ru icon}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>

<p>Matnakash was honored in <a href="/History_of_the_Soviet_Union" title="History of the Soviet Union">Soviet times</a>. In the 1930s, food specialists in <a href="/Armenian_SSR" title="Armenian SSR">Soviet Armenia</a> wanted to mark the new communist country with a more modern looking bread. The matnakash became a mass-produced urban bread. Even the bakers&#39; patterns on the bread were re-interpreted to fit the Soviet agenda. It resembled a plowed field with rows and furrows. The bread&#39;s rim was interpreted as an agricultural field and its imprinted lines as tilted rows.&#60;ref&#62;Armenian Food: Fact, Fiction &#38; Folklore By Irina Petrosian, David Underwood - Page 35&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
