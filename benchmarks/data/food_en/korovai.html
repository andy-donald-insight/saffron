<p>The bread has ancient origins, and comes from the pagan belief in the magical properties of <a href="/Grain" title="Grain">grain</a>.&#60;ref name=eou&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages\K\O\KorovaiIT.htm" rel="nofollow">korovai</a> at the <a class="external text" href="http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/default.asp" rel="nofollow">Encyclopedia of Ukraine</a>&#60;/ref&#62;  Korovai was a large round braided <a href="/Bread" title="Bread">bread</a>, traditionally baked from <a href="/Wheat_flour" title="Wheat flour">wheat flour</a> and decorated with symbolic flags and figurines, such as suns, moons, birds, animals, and pine cones.&#60;ref&#62;Betsy Oppenneer. <i>Celebration Breads: Recipes, Tales, and Traditions </i>. <a href="/Simon_and_Schuster" title="Simon and Schuster">Simon and Schuster</a>, 2003. <a class="external text" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0743224833" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0743224833">ISBN 0-7432-2483-3</a>&#60;/ref&#62;  Wheat stalks, herbs, nuts, flowers and fruit were used to embellish the korovai. The bread has no set design, and the style and ornamentation of the korovai varies by region, although colors red, gold and silver were most commonly employed in decoration.&#60;ref name=caravai&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.nazdorovya.com/korovai.htm" rel="nofollow">Korovai</a>.

<p>The bread was traditionally prepared in the home of the bride by women who sang traditional songs to guide them through the making.&#60;ref name=eou/&#62;  These women were called the <i>korovainytsi</i> (pol. <i>korowajnice</i>), and were most often invited in odd numbers to do the job of making the bread, usually seven.</p>
<p>The embellishments served a symbolic function. Two birds, made out of dough, represent the couple, and other birds represent family and friends. The entire arrangement is surrounded by a wreath of <a href="/Vinca" title="Vinca">periwinkle</a>, a symbol of love and purity. The korovai receives blessings before it is placed in the oven for baking.</p>
<p>The <a href="/Bride" title="Bride">bride</a> and <a href="/Bridegroom" title="Bridegroom">groom</a> were given the korovai as a blessing before the wedding ceremony. The korovai was shared by all the wedding guests, and this was considered the culmination of the wedding. During times of hardship, when a wedding was impossible, the blessing and sharing of bread was often considered enough to constitute a marriage in the eyes of the community.&#60;ref&#62; Orysia Paszczak Tracz.  <i>Vesillia: Ukrainian weddings in Manitoba over the last century </i>.  <i><a href="/The_Ukrainian_Weekly" title="The Ukrainian Weekly">The Ukrainian Weekly</a></i>.

<p>The top part of the korovai symbolizes the Moon; it is divided in half and belongs to the marrying couple, the next slice goes to the mother and father of the bride, and so on.  In eastern Ukraine, the mother receives a pair of shoes made out of dough, while the father is given an owl, out of those decorating the korovai.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.pisni.org.ua/arview.php?type=ar&#38;id=94" rel="nofollow">Vesillia - Sviata Nedilia:  Sviatyi Caravai</a>.

<p>The bottom section of the korovai called the <i>pidoshva</i> can be shared with the guests and the band as a symbol of good luck and future prosperity.</p>
