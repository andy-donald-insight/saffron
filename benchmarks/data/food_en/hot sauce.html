<p>
The heat, or burning sensation, experienced when consuming hot sauce is caused by <a href="/Capsaicin" title="Capsaicin">capsaicin</a> and related capsaicinoids. The burning sensation is not &#34;real&#34; in the sense of damage being wrought on tissues. The <a href="/Capsaicin#Mechanism_of_action" title="Capsaicin">mechanism of action</a> is instead a chemical <a href="/Agonist" title="Agonist">interaction</a> with the <a href="/Neurology" title="Neurology">neurological system</a>.</p>
<p>The seemingly <a href="/Subjectivity" title="Subjectivity">subjective</a> perceived heat of hot sauces can be measured by the <a href="/Scoville_scale" title="Scoville scale">Scoville scale</a>. The Scoville scale number indicates how many times something must be diluted with an equal volume of <a href="/Water" title="Water">water</a> until people can no longer feel any sensation from the capsaicin. The hottest hot sauce scientifically possible is one rated at 16,000,000 Scoville units, which is pure capsaicin. An example of a hot sauce marketed as achieving this level of heat is Blair&#39;s 16 Million Reserve (due to production variances, it is up to 16 million Scoville units), marketed by <a href="/Blair&#39;s" title="Blair&#39;s">Blair&#39;s Sauces and Snacks</a>. By comparison, <a href="/Tabasco_sauce" title="Tabasco sauce">Tabasco sauce</a> is rated between 2,500 and 5,000 Scoville units (batches vary) - with one of the mildest commercially available condiments, <a href="/Cackalacky_Classic_Condiment" title="Cackalacky Classic Condiment">Cackalacky Classic Condiment</a> Company&#39;s Spice Sauce, weighing in at less than 1000 Scoville units on the standard heat scale.</p>
<p>A general way to estimate the heat of a sauce is to look at the ingredients list. Sauces tend to vary in heat based on the kind of peppers used, and  the further down the list, the less the amount of pepper.</p>

<ul>
<li><b><a href="/Cayenne_pepper" title="Cayenne pepper">Cayenne</a></b> - Sauces made with cayenne, including most of the <a href="/Louisiana_Creole_cuisine" title="Louisiana Creole cuisine">Louisiana</a>-style sauces, are usually hotter than jalapeño, but milder than other sauces.</li>

<li><b><a href="/Habanero" title="Habanero">Habanero</a></b> - Habanero pepper sauces were known as the hottest natural pepper sauces, but nowadays species like <a href="/Bhut_jolokia" title="Bhut jolokia">Bhut jolokia</a>, Naga jolokia or <a href="/Trinidad_Moruga_Scorpion" title="Trinidad Moruga Scorpion">Trinidad Scorpion Moruga</a> are even five or ten-fold hotter.</li>
<li><b><a href="/Jalape%C3%B1o" title="Jalapeño">Jalapeño</a></b> - These sauces include green and red jalapeño chilis, and chipotle (ripened and smoked). Green jalapeño and chipotle are usually the mildest sauces available.  Red jalapeño sauce is generally hotter.</li>

<li><b><a href="/Peri-Peri" title="Peri-Peri">Piri piri</a></b> - The Peri Peri pepper has been <a href="/Naturalisation_(biology)" title="Naturalisation (biology)">naturalized</a> into South Africa and is also known as the African Bird’s Eye pepper, Piri-Piri pepper or Pili-Pili pepper, depending on what area of the country you’re in. The pepper ranges from one half to one inch in length and tapers at a blunt point. The small package packs a mighty punch with a 175,000 rating on the Scoville scale which is near where the habanero pepper is but the pepper is smaller and has a much different flavor. It is most commonly used in a hot sauce, combined with other spices and seasonings because it has a very light, fresh citrus-herbal flavor that blends well with the flavors of most other ingredients.&#60;ref name=&#34;Peri-Peri Peppers&#34;&#62;{{cite web|title=Peri-Peri Peppers|url=<a class="external free" href="http://doggonesauce.com/2013/01/peri-peri-pepper-in-hot-sauces/" rel="nofollow">http://doggonesauce.com/2013/01/peri-peri-pepper-in-hot-sauces/</a>}}&#60;/ref&#62;</li>

<li><b><a href="/Capsaicin" title="Capsaicin">Capsaicin</a> extract</b> - The hottest sauces are made from capsaicin extract.

Many are too hot to consume more than a drop or two in a pot of food.  These novelty sauces are typically only sold by specialty retailers and are usually more expensive.</li>
<li><b>Other ingredients</b> - heat is also affected by other ingredients. <a href="/Mustard_oil" title="Mustard oil">Mustard oil</a> and <a href="/Wasabi" title="Wasabi">wasabi</a> can be added to increase the sensation of heat but generally, more ingredients in a sauce dilute the effect of the chilis, resulting in a milder flavor.

<p><a href="/Capsaicin" title="Capsaicin">Capsaicinoids</a> are the chemicals responsible for the &#34;hot&#34; taste of chili peppers. They are fat soluble and therefore water will be of no assistance when countering the burn. The most effective way to relieve the burning sensation is with dairy products, such as milk and yogurt. A protein called <a href="/Casein" title="Casein">casein</a> occurs in dairy products which binds to the capsaicin, effectively making it less available to &#34;burn&#34; the mouth, and the milk fat helps keep it in suspension. Rice is also useful for ameliorating the impact, especially when it is included with a mouthful of the hot food. These foods are typically included in the cuisine of cultures that specialise in the use of chilis. Mechanical stimulation of the mouth by chewing food will also partially mask the pain sensation.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite journal|last=Nasrawi|first=Christina Wu|author2=Pangborn, Rose Marie|title=Temporal effectiveness of mouth-rinsing on capsaicin mouth-burn|journal=Physiology &#38; Behavior|date=April 1990|volume=47|issue=4|pages=617–623|doi=10.1016/0031-9384(90)90067-E|pmid=2385629}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
