<b>Cruncheroos</b> is a <a href="/Whole_grain" title="Whole grain">whole grain</a> <a href="/Oat" title="Oat">oat</a> <a href="/Breakfast_cereal" title="Breakfast cereal">breakfast cereal</a> manufactured by <a href="/Kellogg_Company" title="Kellogg Company">Kellogg&#39;s</a>, originally available in the <a href="/United_States" title="United States">United States</a> and <a href="/Canada" title="Canada">Canada</a> in two flavors, <a href="/Apple" title="Apple">apple</a> and <a href="/Cinnamon" title="Cinnamon">cinnamon</a> or <a href="/Honey" title="Honey">honey</a> and <a href="/Almond" title="Almond">almonds</a>. As the name states, the cereal was crunchy and O-shaped.</p>
<p>The cereal was created in the early 1990s and featured a <a href="/Mascot" title="Mascot">mascot</a> named &#34;Crunchosaurus Rex&#34;, an <a href="/Anthropomorphic" title="Anthropomorphic">anthropomorphic</a> <a href="/Purple" title="Purple">purple</a> <a href="/Dinosaur" title="Dinosaur">dinosaur</a> who, in <a href="/Television_advertisement" title="Television advertisement">television advertisements</a> would always use stealth and cunning to steal the cereal from another character who is consuming it, such as a hungry museum guard working late at night. Kellogg&#39;s discontinued the cereal from the retail market by the late 1990s, possibly due to its similarity to <a href="/Apple_Jacks" title="Apple Jacks">Apple Jacks</a>, <a href="/Apple_Cinnamon_Cheerios" title="Apple Cinnamon Cheerios">Apple Cinnamon Cheerios</a> and <a href="/Honey_Nut_Cheerios" title="Honey Nut Cheerios">Honey Nut Cheerios</a> which were already popular. However, a plain version, much less sweet than the original, is still marketed to the food service industry, without the Crunchosaurus Rex mascot.</p>
