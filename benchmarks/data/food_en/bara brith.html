<p><b>Bara brith</b>, sometimes known as &#34;speckled <a href="/Bread" title="Bread">bread</a>&#34; (the literal meaning of the original <a href="/Welsh-language" title="Welsh-language">Welsh-language</a> name), can be either a yeast bread enriched with dried fruit (similar to the Irish <a href="/Barmbrack" title="Barmbrack">barmbrack</a>) or something more like a <a href="/Fruitcake" title="Fruitcake">fruitcake</a> made with self-raising flour (no yeast). It is traditionally made with <a href="/Raisin" title="Raisin">raisins</a>, <a href="/Zante_currant" title="Zante currant">currants</a> and <a href="/Candied_peel" title="Candied peel">candied peel</a>.</p>
<p>There are many different recipes for this bread, which is baked and sold commercially in many parts of Wales. The yeast version of bara brith has a limited shelf life and is best eaten as soon as possible. The version made with self-raising flour can be kept for a long time. Welsh recipes favour soaking the dried fruit in tea overnight before the baking.</p>
