<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Etymology">Etymology</span></h2>
<p>The Khmer word <i>kuy teav</i> refers to flat <a href="/Rice_noodles" title="Rice noodles">rice noodles</a> that are cut to various widths including the wide <i><a href="/Shahe_fen" title="Shahe fen">shahe fen</a></i>; this term also refers to the <a href="/Dish_(food)" title="Dish (food)">dish</a>.&#60;ref&#62;<a href="/Chuon_Nath" title="Chuon Nath">Nath, Chuon</a>. Khmer-Khmer Dictionary. Buddhist Institute of Cambodia, 1967&#60;/ref&#62; This word is ultimately derived from <i>kóe-tiâu</i> (粿條) of the <a href="/Min_Nan" title="Min Nan">Min Nan</a> dialects of China. It is also seen as cognates in <a href="/Southeast_Asia" title="Southeast Asia">Southeast Asia</a> with <i>hủ tiếu</i> in Vietnamese and <i>kuai tiao</i> ({{lang|th|ก๋วยเตี๋ยว}}) in Thai  and <i>kway teow</i> in Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei. </p>
<p>In Khmer, <i>kuy teav</i> is properly pronounced {{IPA-km|kuj t̪ieʋ|IPA}} but is often <a href="/Elision" title="Elision">elided</a> to {{IPA-km|kə t̪ieʋ|IPA}} (romanized as <i>ka tieu</i>, <i>ka teav</i>, etc.) due to the <a href="/Sesquisyllabic" title="Sesquisyllabic">sesquisyllabic</a> nature of the Khmer language.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Preparation">Preparation</span></h2>
<p><i>Kuy teav</i> is prepared with partially dry thin squarish rice noodles cooked by quickly immersing the noodles in boiling water. The noodles are then strained, placed into a bowl, and moistened with nutty, caramelised <a href="/Garlic" title="Garlic">garlic</a> oil. After dressing with a sticky brown liquid made of <a href="/Oyster_sauce" title="Oyster sauce">oyster sauce</a>, <a href="/Soy_sauce" title="Soy sauce">soy sauce</a> and a pinch of <a href="/Sugar" title="Sugar">sugar</a>, the bowl is then filled with a clear broth made from pork bones, dried squid, and sugar, and seasoned with a bit of fish sauce. Then the meat toppings are added, which may include an assembly of different types of meat, such as <a href="/Gi%C3%B2_l%E1%BB%A5a" title="Giò lụa">pork loaf</a>, minced pork, pork belly, duck, seafood or offal. Availability is the main factor in what toppings are used in <i>kuy teav</i>; some versions can be quite humble and basic, using only some ground pork and perhaps some <a href="/Dried_shrimp" title="Dried shrimp">dried shrimp</a> for protein, while others can be more time consuming and extravagant. Lastly, when the dish is presented at the table, the diner will then add a number of garnishes and aromatics to customise the dish in accordance with his or her preferences.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="In_Cambodia">In Cambodia</span></h2>
<p>In Cambodia, <i>kuy teav</i> is still primarily a <a href="/Breakfast" title="Breakfast">breakfast</a> dish, and will typically be sold out by vendors before midday. As the pork broth is intended to be subtle rather than spicy, a plethora of optional herbs and other aromatics is always presented, allowing the diner to adjust the textures and flavours of the dish to his or her liking. In fact, in Cambodia it is precisely the use of garnishes and condiments that defines the main flavour profile of the dish (garlic, limes and pepper are a common flavour trio in Cambodian cuisine), rather than the broth. The dish is always served with the requisite garnishes of a few <a href="/Lettuce" title="Lettuce">lettuce</a> leaves, <a href="/Sprouting" title="Sprouting">bean sprouts</a>, fresh herbs (such as <a href="/Spring_onions" title="Spring onions">spring onions</a> (scallions), <a href="/Eryngium_foetidum" title="Eryngium foetidum">sawtooth coriander</a> and <a href="/Holy_basil" title="Holy basil">holy basil</a>), crushed black <a href="/Kampot_(pepper)" title="Kampot (pepper)">Kampot</a> pepper, lime juice, and caramelised garlic oil. Many types of chilli (fresh, dried, pickled) and chilli sauce are also normally present at the table, to either add into the broth or to be used as a dipping sauce for the meat toppings, as well as <a href="/Soy_sauce" title="Soy sauce">soy sauce</a>, <a href="/Fish_sauce" title="Fish sauce">fish sauce</a> and sugar. <i>Kuy teav</i> is also sometimes eaten with <a href="/Youtiao" title="Youtiao">deep fried breadsticks</a>, similar to how the Cambodians would eat <a href="/Congee" title="Congee">congee</a> (rice porridge).</p>
<p>Moreover, <i>kuy teav</i> may be presented in one of two ways: with all the ingredients in the soup, or with the soup on the side. Both versions can have exactly the same ingredients but allow the diner to control the balance of flavours, spiciness and textures. When the dish is served this way (“dry” as opposed to “wet”) the dish takes on the appearance of a noodle salad. Finally, the Phnom Penh version of <i>kuy teav</i> is the most extravagant and features the most embellishments, owing to the city’s historical wealth and importance. <i>Kuy teav Phnom Penh</i> may contain some or all of the following toppings: sliced <a href="/Pork_belly" title="Pork belly">pork belly</a>, ground pork, pig’s blood jelly, chopped pork offal (such as intestine, heart, liver and lung), <a href="/Peking_duck" title="Peking duck">roast duck</a>, Mekong River prawns, sliced <a href="/Fish_cake" title="Fish cake">fish cake</a> and <a href="/Squid" title="Squid">squid</a>. Modern-day versions of <i>kuy teav</i> featuring beef, chicken or seafood (rather than the original pork broth) have also evolved, but the plethora of garnishes that distinguish <i>kuy teav</i> remains the same.</p>

As both <a href="/Thailand" title="Thailand">Thailand</a> and <a href="/Vietnam" title="Vietnam">Vietnam</a> have large ethnic <a href="/Khmer_people" title="Khmer people">Khmer</a> populations (over a million people each), in addition to the common thread of centuries of Chinese migration, this dish is also popular in neighbouring countries, as well as countries that have a large expatriate Khmer population. At Cambodian restaurants in <a href="/France" title="France">France</a>, the <a href="/U.S." title="U.S.">U.S.</a> and <a href="/Australia" title="Australia">Australia</a>, <i>kuy teav</i> is considered a staple. The <a href="/Phnom_Penh" title="Phnom Penh">Phnom Penh</a> version of <i>kuy teav</i> (called <i>kuy teav Phnom Penh</i> in Khmer and <i>{{lang|vi|hủ tiếu Nam Vang}}</i> in Vietnamese) is hugely popular in southern Vietnam, having been introduced to Vietnam some time during the 1960s (while the original basic version of <i>kuy teav</i> was probably introduced much earlier). For a long time, the most common form of <i>kuy teav</i>/<i>{{lang|vi|hủ tiếu}}</i> contained only slices of roast pork for protein and no seafoods—only a few restaurants specialized in <i>{{lang|vi|hủ tiếu Nam Vang}}</i> in its original form, which also included liver, intestine, tongue and ground pork. However, over time, Vietnamese restaurateurs started adding shrimp and crab to the basic pork <i>{{lang|vi|hủ tiếu}}</i>, thus blurring the line with <i>{{lang|vi|hủ tiếu Nam Vang}}</i>. <i>{{lang|vi|<a href="/H%E1%BB%A7_ti%E1%BA%BFu_M%E1%BB%B9_Tho" title="Hủ tiếu Mỹ Tho">Hủ tiếu Mỹ Tho</a>}}</i>, another version of the basic pork <i>{{lang|vi|hủ tiếu}}</i>, is popular in <a href="/M%E1%BB%B9_Tho" title="Mỹ Tho">Mỹ Tho</a>. This version contains one or more slices of boiled pork hind leg, including the skin, and the noodle is a more chewy variant of the rice noodle.  Most overseas restaurants serve <i>{{lang|vi|hủ tiếu Mỹ Tho}}</i> as <i>{{lang|vi|hủ tiếu dai}}</i>, with glass noodles instead of the traditional extra chewy rice noodle, leading to some confusion by many overseas&#39; customers.</p>
