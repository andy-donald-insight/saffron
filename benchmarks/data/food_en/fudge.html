<p>American-style fudge (containing chocolate) is found in a letter written by Emelyn Battersby Hartridge, a student at <a href="/Vassar_College" title="Vassar College">Vassar College</a> in <a href="/Poughkeepsie%2C_New_York" title="Poughkeepsie, New York">Poughkeepsie</a>, New York. She wrote that her schoolmate&#39;s cousin made fudge in <a href="/Baltimore%2C_Maryland" title="Baltimore, Maryland">Baltimore</a>, Maryland, in 1886 and sold it for 40 cents a pound.  Hartridge obtained the fudge recipe and, in 1888, made {{convert|30|lb|abbr=on}} of fudge for the Vassar College Senior Auction. This Vassar fudge recipe became quite popular at the school for years to come.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite book|last= Benning| first= Lee Edwards |edition= 1993| year=1990| title= Oh Fudge!: A Celebration of America&#39;s Favorite Candy| location= New York| publisher= Owl Books |isbn= 0-8050-2546-4| pages= 3–18}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>

<p>In the late 19th century, shops on <a href="/Mackinac_Island%2C_Michigan" title="Mackinac Island, Michigan">Mackinac Island</a> in <a href="/Michigan" title="Michigan">Michigan</a> began to produce similar products for summer vacationers. Fudge is still produced in some of the original shops on Mackinac Island and the surrounding area. Mackinac Island Fudge ice cream, a vanilla ice cream with chunks of fudge blended in, is also very common in this region and across the United States.{{cn|date=November 2015}}</p>

<p>In forming a <a href="/Fondant" title="Fondant">fondant</a>, it is not easy to keep all <a href="/Vibration" title="Vibration">vibrations</a> and <a href="/Seed_crystal" title="Seed crystal">seed crystals</a> from causing rapid <a href="/Crystallization" title="Crystallization">crystallization</a> into large crystals.  Consequently, <a href="/Milkfat" title="Milkfat">milkfat</a> and <a href="/Corn_syrup" title="Corn syrup">corn syrup</a> are often added.  Corn syrup contains <a href="/Glucose" title="Glucose">glucose</a>, <a href="/Fructose" title="Fructose">fructose</a> (monosaccharides), and <a href="/Maltose" title="Maltose">maltose</a> (disaccharide).  These sugars interact with <a href="/Sucrose" title="Sucrose">sucrose</a> molecules. They help prevent premature crystallization by inhibiting sucrose crystal contact. The fat also helps inhibit rapid crystallization.  Controlling the crystallization of the <a href="/Supersaturation" title="Supersaturation">supersaturated</a> sugar solution is the key to making smooth fudge. Initiation of crystals before the desired time will result in fudge with fewer, larger sugar grains. The final texture would then have a grainy <a href="/Mouthfeel" title="Mouthfeel">mouthfeel</a> rather than the smooth texture of high quality fudge.</p>
<p>One of the most important attributes of fudge is its texture.  The end-point temperature separates hard <a href="/Caramel" title="Caramel">caramel</a> from fudge. The higher the peak temperature, the more sugar is dissolved and the more water is evaporated, resulting in a higher sugar-to-water ratio. Before the availability of cheap and accurate thermometers, cooks would use the <a href="/Candy#Sugar_stages" title="Candy">ice water test</a>, also known as the cold water test, to determine the saturation of the confection. Fudge is made at the &#34;soft ball&#34; stage, which varies by altitude and ambient humidity from {{convert|235|°F|abbr=on}} to {{convert|240|°F|abbr=on}}.</p>
<p>Some recipes call for making fudge with prepared <a href="/Marshmallow" title="Marshmallow">marshmallows</a> as the sweetener. This allows the finished confection to use the structure of the marshmallow for support instead of relying on the crystallization of the sucrose.</p>

<p>Hot fudge in the <a href="/United_States" title="United States">United States</a> and <a href="/Canada" title="Canada">Canada</a> is usually considered to be a <a href="/Chocolate" title="Chocolate">chocolate</a> product often used as a topping for ice cream in a heated form, particularly <a href="/Sundae" title="Sundae">sundaes</a> and <a href="/Parfait_(food)" title="Parfait (food)">parfaits</a>. It may also occasionally be used as a topping for <a href="/S&#39;more" title="S&#39;more">s&#39;mores</a>.   It is a thick, chocolate-flavored syrup (flavored with real or artificial flavorings) similar in flavor and texture to chocolate fudge, except less viscous.</p>
