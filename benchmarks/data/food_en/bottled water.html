A number of cities and companies worldwide have <a href="/Vending_machine" title="Vending machine">vending machines</a> that dispense purified water into customer&#39;s own containers. All dispensers filter the location&#39;s tap water. In North America, these machines are typically located outside of supermarkets.</p>
<p>Of all the water vending companies, Glacier Water is by far the largest. Since its inception in 1983, Glacier Water has experienced significant growth in machine placements and has created an extensive network of approximately 17,000 water vending machines (year 2010) located throughout the United States and Canada.</p>

<p>It is not uncommon for business or individuals to subscribe to a bottled water service. These services deliver water either monthly or weekly, sometimes even daily. Traditionally, water in glass bottles (jugs) was provided to electric coolers in areas of businesses without plumbing. Plastic containers have replaced those glass jugs, however, dispensers at businesses now may stand alongside of existing water taps or fountains.</p>

<p>The FDA has established &#34;Standards of Identity&#34; for bottled water products sold in the U.S. For a product to be considered “bottled water”, it cannot contain sweeteners or chemical additives (other than flavors, extracts or essences) and must be calorie-free and sugar-free. If flavors, extracts and essences—derived from spice or fruit—are added to the water, these additions must comprise less than 1% by weight of the final product. The FDA Code of Federal Regulations establishes limitations for the amount of fluoride that can added to water. Mineral water contains at least 250 parts per million total dissolved solids (TDS). &#34;Purified water&#34; is defined in the United States Pharmacopoeia.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Perceptions_about_bottled_water">Perceptions about bottled water</span></h3>
<p>Bottled water is perceived by many as being a safer alternative to other sources of water such as tap water. Bottled water usage has increased even in countries where clean tap water is present.&#60;ref name= ref7&#62;Ferrier, Catherine. &#34;Bottled water: understanding a social phenomenon.&#34; AMBIO: A Journal of the Human Environment 30.2 (2001): 118-119.&#60;/ref&#62;  This may be attributed to consumers disliking the taste of tap water or its <a href="/Organoleptics" title="Organoleptics">organoleptics</a>.&#60;ref name= ref9&#62;Doria, M. D. &#34;Bottled water versus tap water: understanding consumers-preferences.&#34; J Water Health 271 (2006): 276.&#60;/ref&#62;  Another contributing factor to this shift could be the marketing success of bottled water. The success of bottled water marketing can be seen by <a href="/Perrier" title="Perrier">Perrier</a>&#39;s transformation of a bottle of water into a <a href="/Status_symbol" title="Status symbol">status symbol</a>.&#60;ref name= ref9 /&#62; However, while bottled water has grown in both consumption and sales, the industry’s advertising expenses are considerably less than other beverages. According to the <a href="/Beverage_Marketing_Corporation" title="Beverage Marketing Corporation">Beverage Marketing Corporation</a> (BMC), in 2013, the bottled water industry spent $60.6 million on advertising. That same year, <a href="/Sports_drink" title="Sports drink">sports drinks</a> spent $128 million, sodas spent $564 million, and beer spent $1 billion.</p>
<p>Consumers tend to choose bottled water due to health related reasons.&#60;ref name= ref9 /&#62; In communities that experience problems with their tap water, bottled water consumption is significantly higher. The International Bottled Water Association guidelines state that bottled water companies cannot compare their product to tap water in marketing operations. Consumers are also affected by memories associated with particular brands.&#60;ref name= ref9 /&#62; For example, Coca-Cola took their <a href="/Dasani" title="Dasani">Dasani</a> product off of the UK market after finding levels of bromate that were higher than legal standards because consumers in the UK associated this flaw with the Dasani product.&#60;ref name= ref9 /&#62;</p>
<p>&#34;Bottled water sales are higher amongst African – American, Asians and Hispanic groups, which typically have lower incomes than whites.&#34;&#60;ref name= ref9 /&#62; Some hypothesize that these differences are due to the geographic distribution of ethnic groups. It was theorized that ethnic differences in bottled water usage &#34;mirror the variability of water system quality between urban, suburban and rural areas (Abrahams et al. 2000) and it was also pointed out that they might reflect the memory of past problems caused by deficient tap-water systems in deprived areas (Olson 1999).&#34;&#60;ref name= ref9 /&#62; In France, a similar geographic study in the early 1970s found that bottled water consumption was found to be much higher in urban areas (Ferrier 2001). This finding was &#34;also explained in terms of the poor quality of urban tap water and of the bad condition of the old lead pipes in French cities. Nonetheless, while poor tap water quality may motivate the public to search for alternative sources, it alone does not necessarily lead to higher consumption of bottled water.&#34;&#60;ref name= ref9 /&#62;</p>
<p>Some surveys &#34;found that bottled water, far from being an alternative to tap water, seems to be mostly consumed as a substitute for alcoholic and traditional soft drinks (e.g. AWWA-RF 1993; FWR 1996) – the exception being when water contamination presents serious health risks and the trust in the tap water company is highly eroded (e.g. Lonnon 2004).&#34;&#60;ref name= ref9 /&#62; Another explanation for the rise in popularity of bottled water is alternative explanation is that &#34;the consumption of &#39;pure&#39; and &#39;natural&#39; bottled water in degraded environments may represent a symbolic purging behavior.&#34;&#60;ref name= ref9 /&#62;</p>
<p>Many low-income families avoid drinking tap water because they fear it may cause sickness.&#60;ref&#62;&#34;Bottled, filtered, and tap water use in Latino and non-Latino children.&#34; Archives of pediatrics &#38; adolescent medicine 161.5 (2007): 457-461.&#60;/ref&#62; Bottled, filtered, and tap water are all for the most part safe in the United States.&#60;ref name= ref10 /&#62; The Environmental Protection Agency regulations for tap water are &#34;actually stricter than the Food and Drug Administration regulations for bottled water.&#34;&#60;ref name= ref10 /&#62; A study of drinking water in Cincinnati, Ohio, discovered that bacterial counts in bottled water were often higher than those in tap water and fluoride concentration was inconsistent.&#60;ref name= ref10 /&#62;</p>
<p>Globally, there is an intensifying environmental backlash against bottled water usage. As global consumption of bottled water soars, environmental groups such as the <a href="/World_Wide_Fund_for_Nature" title="World Wide Fund for Nature">World Wide Fund for Nature</a> (WWF) and <a href="/Greenpeace" title="Greenpeace">Greenpeace</a> have warned of the huge <a href="/Environmental_footprint" title="Environmental footprint">environmental footprint</a> of the plastic in which the water is packaged.&#60;ref name= ref11&#62;&#34;Mail &#38; Guardian Account Login.&#34; The M&#38;G Online.

<p>In 2001 a WWF study, &#34;Bottled water: understanding a social phenomenon&#34;, warned that in many countries, bottled water may be no safer or healthier than tap water and it sold for up to 1,000 times the price. It said the booming market would put severe pressure on recycling plastics and could lead to landfill sites drowning in mountains of plastic bottles.&#60;ref name= ref11 /&#62; Also, the study discovered that the production of bottled water uses more water than the consumer actually buys in the bottle itself.&#60;ref name= ref11 /&#62;</p>

<p>Bottled water is more expensive than municipally-supplied tap water.  Tap water sources and delivery systems (taps and faucets) are fixed in place while bottled water is available at many differing price points and in a variety of size formats.</p>
<p>&#34;The consumption of bottled and filtered water has dramatically increased in the United States during the past decade, with bottled water sales tripling to about $4 billion a year. More than 50% of the US population drinks bottled water and &#39;people spend from 240 to over 10,000 times more per gallon for bottled water than they typically do for tap water.&#39; An annual supply of bottled water for a person who consumes 8 glasses a day would cost approximately $200; the same amount of tap water would cost approximately $0.33. In general, women are more likely to drink bottled water than men, and Hispanic women are the group most likely to drink bottled water.&#34;&#60;ref name= ref10&#62;Hobson, Wendy L., et al. &#34;Bottled, filtered, and tap water use in Latino and non-Latino children.&#34; Archives of pediatrics &#38; adolescent medicine 161.5 (2007): 457-461.&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>The Beverage Marketing Corporation (BMC) states that in 2013, the average wholesale price per gallon of domestic non-sparkling bottled water was $1.21. BMC’s research also shows that consumers actually tend to buy bottled water in bulk from supermarkets (25.3%) or large discount retailers (57.9%) because it costs significantly less. Convenience stores are likely to have higher prices (4.5%), as do drug stores (2.8%). The remaining 9.5% is accounted for through vending machines, cafeterias and other food service outlets, and other types of sales.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|title=How Much Does Bottled Water Cost?|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.bottledwater.org/economics/real-cost-of-bottled-water" rel="nofollow">http://www.bottledwater.org/economics/real-cost-of-bottled-water</a>|website=IBWA|accessdate=11 February 2015}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>

<p>The recent documentary <i><a href="/Tapped_(film)" title="Tapped (film)">Tapped</a></i> argues against the bottled water industry, asserting that tap water is healthier, more environmentally sustainable, and more ecologically sound than bottled water. The film focuses on the bottled water industry in the United States. The film has received largely positive reviews, and has spawned college campus groups such as <a href="/Beyond_the_Bottle" title="Beyond the Bottle">Beyond the Bottle</a>. Yet, as many people remain generally unaware of the negative health and environmental impacts associated with bottled water, recent research in <a href="/Environmental_psychology" title="Environmental psychology">environmental psychology</a> has started to investigate how to reduce the public&#39;s consumption of bottled water.&#60;ref name=&#34;van der Linden&#34;&#62;{{cite journal | author = van der Linden, S. | title = Exploring Beliefs About Bottled Water and Intentions To Reduce Consumption: The Dual-Effect of Social Norm Activation and Persuasive Information | journal = Environment and Behavior | doi = 10.1177/0013916513515239}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
