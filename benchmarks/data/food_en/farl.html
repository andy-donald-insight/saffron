<p>A <b>farl</b> (reduced form of the <a href="/Scots_language" title="Scots language">Scots</a> <i>fardel</i>) is any of various quadrant-shaped <a href="/Flatbread" title="Flatbread">flatbreads</a> and <a href="/Cake" title="Cake">cakes</a>, traditionally made by cutting a round into four pieces.</p>
<p>In <a href="/Northern_Ireland" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>, the term generally refers to <a href="/Soda_bread" title="Soda bread">soda bread</a> and to potato bread or cakes (<a href="/Potato_farls" title="Potato farls">potato farls</a>). While soda bread can also be baked as a normal loaf, that used in an <a href="/Full_breakfast#Ulster" title="Full breakfast">Ulster fry breakfast</a> is made as farls (that is to say, flat rounds about 3/4 inch thick which are then cut into quarters). Modern commercially mass-produced potato farls, however, are often rectangular in form.</p>
<p>In Scotland today, the word is used less than in Northern Ireland, but a farl can be a quarter piece of a large flat <a href="/Scone_(bread)" title="Scone (bread)">scone</a>, <a href="/Bannock_(food)" title="Bannock (food)">bannock</a>, or <a href="/Oatcake" title="Oatcake">oatcake</a>. It may also be used for <a href="/Shortbread" title="Shortbread">shortbread</a> when baked in this particular shape.&#60;ref name=&#34;DSL&#34;&#62;</p>
