<p>The tortilla is made from specially treated (<a href="/Nixtamalization" title="Nixtamalization">nixtamalized</a>) <a href="/Maize" title="Maize">maize</a> flour, which has been a staple food of the Mexican region since pre-Columbian times; these are also now commonly made from <a href="/Wheat" title="Wheat">wheat</a> flour (<i>tortilla de harina</i> or <i>tortilla de trigo</i>). The maize and wheat Mexican tortillas have different textures: the maize (corn) version is somewhat thicker and heartier in texture, while the wheat version is less easily broken due to its high gluten content, and can be made larger in circumference and thinner without breaking too easily.</p>
<p>In <a href="/Panama" title="Panama">Panama</a>, a tortilla is a deep fried cornmeal disk, 2–3 inches in diameter. The South American tortilla of Bolivia and Chile is inspired by the Mexican food, but is a small flat cake, usually salty, made with wheat or maize flour, and cooked over embers.</p>
<p>The wheat flour tortilla is probably best known as the tortilla used to make <a href="/Burrito" title="Burrito">burritos</a>, a dish originating in Texas, originally part of the Spanish empire and then briefly a part of the newly created state of Mexico. Wheat tortillas have also become a staple of the peoples of northwestern Mexican states (such as <a href="/Sonora" title="Sonora">Sonora</a>, <a href="/Sinaloa" title="Sinaloa">Sinaloa</a> and <a href="/Chihuahua_(state)" title="Chihuahua (state)">Chihuahua</a>).</p>
<p>Tortillas vary in size from about 6 to over 30&#38;nbsp;cm (2.4 to over 12 in), depending on the region of the country and the dish for which it is intended.</p>
<p>In commercial production and even in some larger restaurants, automatic machines make tortillas from dough.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History_of_the_corn_tortilla">History of the corn tortilla</span></h2>
<p>According to <a href="/Maya_civilization" title="Maya civilization">Maya</a> legend, tortillas were invented by a peasant for his hungry king in ancient times{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}. The first tortillas discovered, which date back to approximately 10,000 BC, were made of native maize with dried kernel{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}. The Aztecs used a lot of maize, both eaten straight from the cob and in recipes. They ground the maize, and used the cornmeal to make a dough called <i>masa</i>.&#60;ref&#62;Rubios, Fresh Mexican Grill.&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>On 22 April 1519, Spaniards led by <a href="/Hern%C3%A1n_Cort%C3%A9s" title="Hernán Cortés">Hernán Cortés</a>, also known as Hernando Cortez, arrived in what is now Mexico. They found that the inhabitants (Aztecs and other native Mexican peoples) made flat maize bread.

<p>In Cortés&#39; 1520 second letter to King <a href="/Charles_V_of_Spain" title="Charles V of Spain">Charles V of Spain</a>, he described the public markets:</p>
<p>&#60;blockquote&#62;

<p>Traditionally, maize tortillas were made from <a href="/Nixtamalization" title="Nixtamalization">nixtamalized maize</a>; kernels were soaked in a solution of lime (<a href="/Calcium_hydroxide" title="Calcium hydroxide">calcium hydroxide</a>) and water to remove their skins; this also increases the bioavailability of then-unknown <a href="/Niacin" title="Niacin">niacin</a>. The grains were then ground into maize dough (<i>masa</i>). A golf ball-sized piece of dough was patted down by hand into a thin pancake shape, placed on a hot griddle (<i>comal</i>), and cooked on both sides. This tortilla-making process is still used today in southern Mexico.&#60;ref&#62;General History of the Things of New Spain (Historia general de las cosas de Nueva Espana), by the Franciscan friar Bernardino de Sahagun (1450-1590)&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>To meet the needs of big cities and the modern lifestyle, the traditional process was mechanized to increase production of tortillas. In the 1940s and 1950s, one of the first widespread uses of small gas engines and electric motors was to power wet-grain grinders for making <i>masa</i>.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} A hand press or hand patting were still used to form it into tortillas, but by the 1960s, small-scale tortilla-making machines could produce cooked tortillas every two seconds.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}</p>

<p>Today, personal and industrial (Mexican-style) tortilla-making equipment has facilitated and expedited tortilla making. Manually operated wooden tortilla presses of the past led to today&#39;s industrial tortilla machinery, which can produce up to 60,000 tortillas per hour. Tortillas are now not only made from maize meal, but also from wheat flour; home-made and store-bought tortillas are made in many flavors and varieties.</p>
<p>Maize tortillas are naturally low in fat (approximately 2.5&#38;nbsp;grams for a typical size) and sodium, and provide calcium, potassium, fiber, iron and B vitamins.</p>
<p>Tortillas remain a staple food in Mexico and Central America, and have gained popularity and market share elsewhere. In the U.S., tortillas have grown from an &#34;ethnic&#34; to a mainstream food. They have surpassed <a href="/Bagel" title="Bagel">bagels</a> and <a href="/Muffin" title="Muffin">muffins</a>, and have now become the number two packaged bread product sold in the U.S (behind <a href="/Sliced_bread" title="Sliced bread">sliced bread</a>).{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} The Tortilla Industry Association (TIA) estimates, in the U.S. alone, the tortilla industry (tortillas and their products&#38;nbsp;– tortilla chips, tostada shells and taco shells) has become a $6 billion a year industry.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|url=<a class="external free" href="https://www.aibonline.org/resources/statistics/tortillas.html" rel="nofollow">https://www.aibonline.org/resources/statistics/tortillas.html</a> |title=Tortilla Statistics and Trends |publisher=Aibonline.org |accessdate=2012-08-06}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>The wheat flour tortilla has different origins from the traditional maize tortilla. However, the acceptance of the wheat tortilla has increased so rapidly, it now is also part of the basic diet in northern Mexico.</p>

<p>Maize has been the most basic necessity in the kitchen for centuries. It is the most planted crop in the Mexican region. The country grows more than 42 different types of maize. In turn, each of these types has several varieties whose number is estimated at more than 3,000 by the International Center for the Improvement of Maize and Wheat (CIMMYT). The characteristics of each breed are varied according to soil conditions, the relative humidity of the environment, altitude, and even how it is grown. Although some of the earliest evidence of maize cultivation suggests domestication took place in several places at the same time, it is likely this process was linked to people who spoke <a href="/Oto-Manguean" title="Oto-Manguean">Oto-Manguean</a>, although it has questioned the origin of Mexican maize.</p>
<p>Either way, maize is the basis of most Mexican cuisine, with some exception in the culinary traditions of northern Mexico, where wheat is taking the place of maize as the cereal base. The primary way in which maize is consumed in Mexico is the tortilla, but it is also a necessary input for the preparation of almost all types of <a href="/Tamale" title="Tamale">tamales</a>, atoles and snacks. Furthermore, the maize used for tortillas can be ripe and dry, but it is also consumed fresh and mature (maize), or soft and fresh (<i>xilote</i>).&#60;ref&#62;Tacos, Enchiladas and Re-fried Beans: The Invention of Mexican-American Cookery, by Andrew F. Smith, Presented at the at Oregon State University, 1999.&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>Tortillas are consumed daily. Because they are very popular, most tortillas are made in factories with machinery, but they can also be home-made, especially in small towns. Tortilla factories are very common and can be found in any city, village, or settlement, and there are places where there are several in a single street. Tortilla production starts from early morning because lunch is the main meal of the day for most people. In Mexico, lunch is eaten between 1:30&#38;nbsp;p.m. and 3:30&#38;nbsp;p.m. Some supermarkets or grocery stores also sell tortillas, and in such places they can be bought throughout the day.</p>
<p>Tortillas come in several different flavors and colors according to the kind of maize used. Tortillas come with all the traditional foods of Mexico, though not with all the fillings that are used these days.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Northern_Mexico">Northern Mexico</span></h3>
<p>In Northern Mexico and much of the United States, &#34;tortillas&#34; mean wheat-flour tortillas.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} They are the foundation of Mexican border cooking and a relatively recent import. Their popularity was driven by the low cost of inferior grades of wheat flour provided to border markets and by their ability to keep and ship well.&#60;ref&#62;California Mexican-Spanish Cook Book; Selected Mexican and Spanish Recipes, by Bertha Haffner-Ginger, Citizen Print Shop, Los Angeles, 1914.&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>Tortillas are used to prepare many Mexican and, more generally, Latin American dishes. Traditionally, all these dishes (except burritos) are made with maize, not wheat, tortillas. The dishes include:</p>

<p>Tortillas are widely used in the United States, in recipes of Mexican origin and many others. They are commonly used in burritos, which originated in northern Mexico many years ago. As a testament to their popularity, the Tortilla Industry Association (TIA) estimated Americans consumed approximately 85 billion tortillas in 2000 (not including tortilla chips).&#60;ref&#62;TIA news first quarter 2001&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>Tortilla chips&#38;nbsp;— made from maize tortillas cut into wedges, then fried&#38;nbsp;— first gained popularity in the 1940s in Los Angeles, California. These chips were mass-produced there, but are still known as Mexican food. The ingredients in maize tortillas are maize, lime, and water. Fried chips add salt and vegetable oil.</p>
<p>Some alternative ways tortillas can be eaten in the United States include combinations such as beans and meat, apple cinnamon and sugar, or peanut butter and jelly.
