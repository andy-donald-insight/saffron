<p>{{Nihongo|<b><i>Wanko Soba</i></b>|わんこそば}} is a style of Japanese <i><a href="/Soba" title="Soba">soba</a></i> noodles originating from <a href="/Iwate_Prefecture" title="Iwate Prefecture">Iwate Prefecture</a> in Japan, particularly <a href="/Morioka%2C_Iwate" title="Morioka, Iwate">Morioka</a> and <a href="/Hanamaki%2C_Iwate" title="Hanamaki, Iwate">Hanamaki</a>. It consists of a small serving of <i>soba</i> noodles in a small bowl.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History_and_origins">History and origins</span></h2>
<p>The name <i>Wanko</i> comes from the regional dialect of the Iwate Prefecture from which it comes, meaning &#34;<a href="/Bowl" title="Bowl">bowl</a>&#34;, but more specifically, a small, wooden Japanese soup bowl.&#60;ref name=Eater&#62;{{cite web|last=Perry|first=Julien|title=Competitive Eating|url=<a class="external free" href="http://seattle.eater.com/archives/2013/07/09/competitive-eating.php" rel="nofollow">http://seattle.eater.com/archives/2013/07/09/competitive-eating.php</a>|work=Easter Seattle|accessdate=25 July 2013}}&#60;/ref&#62;  There are many theories about the origin of the dish itself however.
</p>
<ul>
<li>One such origin is of a landowner who was having a festival on his land.  There was a crowd of over 100 villagers and guests who customarily ate <i>soba</i> at festivals. However, there were so many people to feed but the pots in which the <i>soba</i> were to be made were very small. The <i>soba</i> noodles were spread around in reduced quantities so that there would be enough for everyone.</li>
<li><a href="/Nanbu_Toshinao" title="Nanbu Toshinao">Nanbu Toshinao</a>, a territorial lord of the <a href="/Nanbu%2C_Aomori" title="Nanbu, Aomori">Nanbu</a> area, came and stopped at a house in <a href="/Hanamaki" title="Hanamaki">Hanamaki</a> asking for a meal.  His retainers served him a local variety of soba in a small soup bowl.  Thinking they served Nanbu Toshinao something too rustic and without much flavor, they were afraid of his reaction.  But Nanbu Toshinao thought it was delicious, and ordered more servings.  This is said to have established the tradition of hosts continuing to serve small bowls until their guest was satisfied.&#60;ref name=IwatePortal&#62;{{cite web|title=Wanko Soba Noodles|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.japan-iwate.info/noodle/wanko.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.japan-iwate.info/noodle/wanko.html</a>|work=A Trip to Iwate|publisher=Iwate Prefecture Tourism Portal|accessdate=25 July 2013}}&#60;/ref&#62; </li>
</ul>

<p>There are many stories of how the dish came to be, but these two are the most common. However, as the term <i>&#34;Wanko&#34;</i> did not come about until after World War II, some repudiate the stories.</p>
<p>In December 1957 in Hanamaki, the Wanko Winter Sumo Place put on an exhibit in which participants from many countries contested to see who could eat the most bowls of <i>wanko soba</i>.</p>
