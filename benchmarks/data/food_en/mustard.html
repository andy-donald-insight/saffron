<p>The project started life as the <a href="/English_Electric" title="English Electric">English Electric</a> Mustard. For one year, collaborative work was done at Edwards Air Base. Once this collaborative work was over, three American prototype similar-looking aircraft appeared at Edwards Air Base. The Space Shuttle would later have a comparative design, and function.{{Dubious |Implication that design was copied?|date=June 2013}}</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Design">Design</span></h2>
<p>MUSTARD was a delta-winged three-stage reusable vehicle which used the <a href="/Triamese" title="Triamese">triamese</a> concept.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.britain-in-space.co.uk/info/pix-archive/mustard.html" rel="nofollow">Britain in Space</a>&#60;/ref&#62;&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.flightglobal.com/FlightPDFArchive/1966/1966%20-%200663.pdf" rel="nofollow">Flight International 10 March 1966</a>&#60;/ref&#62; The design team was led by Tom Smith, Chief of the Aerospace Department at BAC.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1966/1966%20-%200816.html" rel="nofollow">Flight Global 24 March 1966</a>&#60;/ref&#62;</p>

<p>The three components of the design were three largely identical <a href="/Lifting_body" title="Lifting body">lifting bodies</a> (each similar to the <a href="/Northrop_Corporation" title="Northrop Corporation">Northrop</a> <a href="/HL-10" title="HL-10">HL-10</a>), stacked back-to-belly.</p>
<p>The units would be stacked for launch, and two of them would act as boosters to launch the third into Earth orbit. The booster units would feed any excess fuel to the unit which was to be the spacecraft. At 150,000 to 200,000&#38;nbsp;ft. (45,750 to 60,960 m), at around 30 nautical miles, the booster units would separate and land like aircraft.</p>
<p>The spacecraft would place its payload into orbit at around 1000 nautical miles, after 10 minutes from launch, and then return in a like manner.</p>
