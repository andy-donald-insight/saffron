The name has evolved since William Rosenberg opened his first restaurant in 1948 as &#39;Open Kettle&#39;, in Quincy, Massachusetts. The name changed to &#39;Kettle Donuts&#39; in 1949, and the now corporate name &#39;Dunkin&#39; Donuts&#39; was adopted in 1950.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite news |url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.boston.com/business/gallery/dunkin_donuts_history?pg=2" rel="nofollow">http://www.boston.com/business/gallery/dunkin_donuts_history?pg=2</a> |title=History of Dunkin&#39; Donuts |publisher=Boston.com |date=2011-07-26 |accessdate=2013-03-03}}&#60;/ref&#62; Rosenberg conceived of the idea for the chain after his experiences selling food in factories and at construction sites, where doughnuts and coffee were the two most popular items.&#60;ref name=&#34;New York Times&#34; /&#62; Rosenberg sold franchises of Dunkin&#39; Donuts to others as early as 1955. In 1959, the company began growing, which led Rosenberg to lobby for Dunkin&#39; Donuts at the International Franchise Association. </p>
<p>In 1963, Rosenberg’s son Robert, assumed leadership of the company at the age of 25, shortly after graduating from Harvard Business School. Robert stewarded the Company for the next 35 years. Over that time period he and a management team comprised of existing executives, franchise owners, and a few college friends began to change the business in some fundamental ways.</p>
<p>In 1963, Dunkin’ Donuts opened its 100th location, but the brand was not yet the household name that it is today. The company was known as ‘Universal Food Systems’, a portfolio of 10 small food service businesses, including a vending machine company, industrial catering trucks, a cafeteria division, a delicatessen, a few pancake houses, a 15 cent hamburger chain called ‘Howdy Beef N’ Burger’ and most importantly, a number of Dunkin&#39; Donuts shops. However, at the time, each Dunkin’ Donuts location varied greatly. Some locations had 18 stools, while others were much larger, seating up to 100 customers. The menu varied greatly as well. Some shops served a wide variety of offerings, including eggs, pancakes, hamburgers and hot dogs, while others had a more limited menu, offering just doughnuts and coffee.</p>
<p>Over the course of the next 35 years, this team:</p>

<ul>
<li>Focused all the energy behind the Dunkin&#39; Donuts business and sold or closed the other 9 businesses-changing the name of the Company from Universal Food Systems to Dunkin&#39; Donuts by 1968.</li>
<li>Standardized the menu and the shop format while focusing the new store development in specific markets to better advertise and supervise</li>
<li>Began a new products program starting with the introduction in 1964 of a 10 ounce cup of coffee called “Jumbo Java” and over the years added Munchkins (donut hole treats), muffins, cookies, bagels, croissants, and “Coolata”.</li>
<li>In 1968, Dunkin’ Donuts went “public”, when the company sold stock to the public for the first time.</li>
<li>In the 1970’s, created a unique buying program, which saved franchisees up to 2-3% of sales which the franchisees then invested in a National Advertising Program, which achieved national attention for the brand.</li>
<li>In the 1980’s, they changed the delivery service system by moving away from a 20 stool question mark counter and coffee sold in porcelain cups to a self service system and beverages sold in paper cups. They also changed the concept by expanding beyond the four walls of the shop, to bring products through satellite locations to customers wherever they worked, shopped, traveled or played. They introduced territorial areas for franchise owners to open multiple locations and support small bakery commissaries rather than produce product in each individual store.</li>
<li>In 1990, navigated through a hostile takeover attempt by Knightsbridge Capital, a Canadian financial group, to find a friendly buyer in the United Kingdom, Allied Lyons, a spirits and food company. Among it’s holdings, Allied had owned Baskin Robbins in the United States since the 1970’s. Under Allied, Dunkin&#39; Donuts and Baskin merged operations.</li>
<li>In 1995, the brand was revitalized by shifting the focus from doughnuts to coffee.</li>
</ul>
 
<p>Robert retired in July of 1998. In the intervening 35 years the Dunkin&#39; Donuts brand had grown from 100 stores and $10 million in system wide sales to 2,500 locations worldwide and over $2 billion in sales.</p>
<p>William Rosenberg, the founder, had retired from the company in the mid 1980&#39;s and passed away on September 20, 2002, from bladder cancer at the age of 86 in Mashpee, Massachusetts.&#60;ref name=&#34;New York Times&#34; /&#62;</p>
