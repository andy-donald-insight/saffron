<p><b>Frozen noodles</b> and <b>chilled noodles</b> are types of instantly prepared Asian (or European) <a href="/Noodles" title="Noodles">noodles</a> that are sold frozen or chilled. These products differ from prepackaged dehydrated noodles in a number of ways: in flavor, in texture, and in that they normally come packaged with ingredients besides the noodles, such as vegetables, meat, and soup stock.</p>

<p>The production of both chilled and frozen noodles starts with boiled noodles cooked to an optimum state of doneness, generally considered as having a moisture gradient at the surface of the noodles of 80% moisture absorption, and at the core of the noodles of 50% moisture absorption. After boiling, chilled noodles are placed into packaging followed by refrigeration at between {{convert|4|-|10|C|F}}. Frozen noodles, by contrast, are <a href="/Flash_freezing" title="Flash freezing">flash frozen</a>&#60;ref name=&#34;Asian Noodles&#34;&#62;{{cite book |title=Asian Noodles: Science, Technology, and Processing |last=Hou |first=Gary G.

<p>While both Frozen and chilled noodles offer convenience for the mass market, and for short preparation times, each have been found to cause loss of optimal texture when tested using alkaline and white salted noodles. In a 2001 published study by D. W. Hatcher and M. J. Anderson of the <a href="/Canadian_Grain_Commission" title="Canadian Grain Commission">Canadian Grain Commission</a>, textural attributes of the frozen variety were tested at 1 and 4 weeks after frozen storage, and the chilled variety at the 30 minute and 1, 2 and 7 days marks. Both the frozen and the chilled noodles showed a decline in textural characteristics which increased in severity the further forward in time they were sampled after storage. It was also indicated that the texture of raw frozen noodles, cooked after defrosting, as opposed to precooked and then frozen noodles, fared much better.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite paper | author = D. W.
