Walnut oil is edible and is generally used less than other oils in <a href="/Food_preparation" title="Food preparation">food preparation</a>, often due to high pricing.  It is light-coloured and delicate in flavour and scent, with a nutty quality.  Although chefs sometimes use walnut oil for pan frying, most avoid walnut oil for high temperature cooking; heating tends to reduce the oil&#39;s flavour &#38; nutritive value and to produce a slight bitterness. In addition cooking rapidly destroys the oil&#39;s antioxidants. Walnut oil is at its most valuable in cold dishes such as salad dressings, where it lends its flavour to best advantage.</p>
<p>Over 99% of walnut oil sold in the USA is produced in California.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external free" href="http://www.walnuts.org/walnut-industry/&#60;/ref&#38;gt" rel="nofollow">http://www.walnuts.org/walnut-industry/&#60;/ref&#38;gt</a>; There are also producers in <a href="/China" title="China">China</a>, <a href="/Iran" title="Iran">Iran</a>, <a href="/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>, <a href="/France" title="France">France</a>, <a href="/Romania" title="Romania">Romania</a>, <a href="/Moldova" title="Moldova">Moldova</a>, <a href="/Ukraine" title="Ukraine">Ukraine</a>, <a href="/Turkey" title="Turkey">Turkey</a>, <a href="/Australia" title="Australia">Australia</a>, <a href="/New_Zealand" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a>.</p>
<p>There are two types of walnut oil commercially available: cold pressed and refined.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Cold pressed walnut oil is typically more expensive due to the loss of a higher percentage of the oil. Refined walnut oil is <a href="/Expeller_pressed" title="Expeller pressed">expeller pressed</a> and saturated with solvent to extract the highest percentage of oil available in the nut meat. The solvents are subsequently eliminated by heating the mixture to around {{convert|400|F|C|-1}}. Both methods produce food grade culinary oils.</p>
<p>Walnut oil, like all nut, seed and vegetable oils will undergo <a href="/Rancidification" title="Rancidification">rancidification</a> accelerated by heat, light, and oxygen.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}</p>

<p>Walnut oil was one of the most important oils used by <a href="/Renaissance" title="Renaissance">Renaissance</a> painters. Its short drying time and lack of yellow tint make it a good <a href="/Oil_paint" title="Oil paint">oil paint</a> base <a href="/Paint_thinner" title="Paint thinner">thinner</a> and brush cleaner.</p>
<p>Some <a href="/Woodworking" title="Woodworking">woodworkers</a> favour walnut oil as a finish for implements that will come in contact with food, such as cutting boards and wooden bowls because of its safety. People who mix oil &#38; wax to formulate wood finishes value walnut oil as an ingredient because of the edibility of both ingredients.  The oil typically is combined with beeswax in a mixture of 1/3 oil to 2/3 beeswax.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|author=Erik Schimek |url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.erikorganic.com/green/finishing-with-walnut-oil-and-beeswax/" rel="nofollow">http://www.erikorganic.com/green/finishing-with-walnut-oil-and-beeswax/</a> |title=Finishing with Walnut Oil and Beeswax |publisher=Erikorganic.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-10}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
