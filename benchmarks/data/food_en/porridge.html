<b>Porridge</b> (also spelled <b>porage</b>, <b>porrige</b>, <b>parritch</b>)&#60;ref name = &#34;oed&#34; /&#62; is a dish made by boiling ground, crushed, or chopped starchy plants - typically <a href="/Grain" title="Grain">grain</a> - in <a href="/Water" title="Water">water</a> and/or <a href="/Milk" title="Milk">milk</a>, often with flavourings. It is usually served hot in a bowl. It may be sweetened with sugar, honey etc. and served as a sweet dish, or mixed with spices, vegetables etc. to make a savoury dish.</p>
<p>The term is often used specifically for <a href="/Oat" title="Oat">oat</a> porridge (called <b>oatmeal</b> in the U.S. and parts of Canada), which is eaten for breakfast with <a href="/Salt" title="Salt">salt</a>, <a href="/Sugar" title="Sugar">sugar</a>, <a href="/Milk" title="Milk">milk</a>, <a href="/Cream" title="Cream">cream</a> and/or <a href="/Butter" title="Butter">butter</a>, and sometimes other flavourings. Oat porridge is also sold in ready-made or partly-cooked form as an <a href="/Instant_breakfast" title="Instant breakfast">instant breakfast</a>.</p>
<p>Other grains used for porridge include <a href="/Semolina" title="Semolina">semolina</a>, <a href="/Rice" title="Rice">rice</a>, <a href="/Wheat" title="Wheat">wheat</a>, <a href="/Barley" title="Barley">barley</a>, <a href="/Maize" title="Maize">corn</a> and <a href="/Buckwheat" title="Buckwheat">buckwheat</a>. Many types of porridge have their own names, e.g. <a href="/Polenta" title="Polenta">polenta</a>, <a href="/Grits" title="Grits">grits</a> and <a href="/Kasha" title="Kasha">kasha</a>.</p>
<p>Porridge is a staple food in much of Africa.</p>
<p>Historically porridge was a staple food in much of Northern Europe and Russia, often made from <a href="/Barley" title="Barley">barley</a>, though other grains and yellow peas could be used, depending on local conditions. It was primarily a savoury dish, with meats, root crops, vegetables and herbs added for flavour. Porridge could be cooked in a large metal <a href="/Kettle" title="Kettle">kettle</a> over hot coals or heated in a cheaper <a href="/Earthenware" title="Earthenware">earthenware</a> container by adding hot stones until boiling hot. Until <a href="/Leavening_agent" title="Leavening agent">leavened</a> bread and baking ovens became commonplace in Europe, porridge was a typical means of preparing cereal crops for the table. It was also commonly used as <a href="/Prison_food" title="Prison food">prison food</a> for inmates in the British prison system, and so &#34;doing porridge&#34; became a slang term for a sentence in prison.</p>
<p>As porridge is easy to digest, it is used traditionally in many cultures as a food for the sick, and is also often eaten by <a href="/Sportsperson" title="Sportsperson">athletes</a> in training.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|last=Fisher|first=Roxanne|title=Eat like an athlete - Beckie Herbert|work=<a href="/BBC_Food" title="BBC Food">BBC Good Food</a>|publisher=<a href="/BBC_Worldwide" title="BBC Worldwide">BBC Worldwide</a>|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/howto/guide/eat-athlete-beckie-herbert" rel="nofollow">http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/howto/guide/eat-athlete-beckie-herbert</a>|accessdate=29 April 2014}}&#60;/ref&#62;&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|last=Chappell|first=Bill|title=Athletes And The Foods They Eat: Don&#39;t Try This At Home|work=The Torch|publisher=<a href="/NPR" title="NPR">NPR</a>|date=25 July 2012|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetorch/2012/07/25/157370171/athletes-and-the-foods-they-eat-dont-try-this-at-home" rel="nofollow">http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetorch/2012/07/25/157370171/athletes-and-the-foods-they-eat-dont-try-this-at-home</a>|accessdate=29 April 2014}}&#60;/ref&#62;&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|last=Randall|first=David|authorlink=David Randall|title=Cursed!

<p>Oats for porridge may be whole (<a href="/Groats" title="Groats">groats</a>), cut into two or three pieces (called &#39;pinhead&#39;, &#39;steel-cut&#39; or &#39;coarse&#39; oatmeal), ground into medium or fine <a href="/Oatmeal" title="Oatmeal">oatmeal</a>, or steamed and rolled into flakes of varying sizes and thicknesses (called &#39;rolled oats&#39;, the largest size being &#39;jumbo&#39;). The larger the pieces of oat used, the more textured the resulting porridge. It is said that, because of their size and shape, the body breaks steel-cut oats down more slowly than rolled oats, reducing spikes in <a href="/Blood_sugar" title="Blood sugar">blood sugar</a> and keeping you full longer.&#60;ref name=redmill&#62;{{cite web|title=Steel Cut, Rolled, Instant, Scottish?

The oats are cooked in milk, water or a mixture of the two. <a href="/Scotland" title="Scotland">Scottish</a> traditionalists allow only oats, water and salt.&#60;ref name=cloake&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2011/nov/10/how-to-cook-perfect-porridge" rel="nofollow">How to cook perfect porridge</a>, Felicity Cloake, <i>The Guardian</i>, 10 November 2011. An article by an expert who has systematically tried many variants to get the best result.&#60;/ref&#62; Traditionally, it is left overnight on a banked-up (barely alight) cooking range or in smouldering fire ashes, possibly due to religious (sabbatarian) restrictions spreading to daily usage. Other religious factors in preparation have included the admonition to stir only clockwise, as &#34;anti-clockwise stirring will encourage the devil into your breakfast&#34;. There are techniques suggested by cooks, such as pre-soaking, but a comparative test documented in an article in <i><a href="/The_Guardian" title="The Guardian">The Guardian</a></i> found very little difference in the end result.&#60;ref name=cloake/&#62;</p>
<p>Various flavourings can be used, and can vary widely by taste and locality. Demerara sugar, golden syrup, Greek yoghurt and honey, even langoustine tails and scallops have been employed for this purpose. A girdle of very cold milk or single cream is believed to be essential (by some &#39;experts&#39;), traditionally served in a separate bowl to keep it cold.&#60;ref name=cloake/&#62; Glaswegians typically use canned evaporated milk, jam. Use of whisky, rum, or sherry have been reported. Cooking time can be adjusted to preference, but simmering for ten minutes is typical for non-instant oatmeal. Instant oatmeal, including flavoured instant oatmeal, is common and can be prepared with the application of hot water.</p>
