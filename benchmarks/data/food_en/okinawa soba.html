<p>Today the word <i><a href="/Soba" title="Soba">soba</a></i> means buckwheat, in particular buckwheat noodles, in Japanese. This word is in origin an abbreviation of <i>soba-mugi</i> (buckwheat). The word <i>soba</i> refers to the edge in ancient Japanese, and <i>soba-mugi</i> meant &#34;edgy wheat&#34;. Around the 16th century, buckwheat began to be processed into noodles. This method was originally known as <i>soba-kiri</i> (lit. soba cutting) but it was later abbreviated into <i>soba</i>. Note that soba was mainly consumed in eastern Japan. It was not popular in western Japan including Okinawa. Buckwheat noodles remain rare in Okinawa, where they are known as <i>Nihon soba</i> (Japanese soba) or <i>kuroi soba</i> (black soba).</p>
<p>In modern Japan, the meaning of <i>soba</i> was extended so that it could refer to other types of noodles. <a href="/Yakisoba" title="Yakisoba">Yakisoba</a> (stir-fried noodles) contain no buckwheat. <i>Shina soba</i>, commonly known as <i>Chūka soba</i> or <a href="/Ramen" title="Ramen">rāmen</a> today, is also made from wheat flour. Okinawa soba falls into this category and is made entirely from wheat.</p>
<p>Under a fair competition regulation, soba was standardized as &#34;the noodles contain at least 30% of buckwheat.&#34; This definition caused a problem when Okinawa was returned to Japan in 1972. In 1976, the <a href="/Fair_Trade_Commission_(Japan)" title="Fair Trade Commission (Japan)">Fair Trade Commission</a> tried to make Okinawa Prefecture drop the name &#34;soba&#34; because Okinawa&#39;s soba did not conform to the regulation. The Okinawa Noodle Manufacturing Co-op negotiated with the Fair Trade Commission and, as a result, it was accepted as one of several exceptions, under the name of <i>Okinawa soba</i>.</p>

<p>Some attempt to trace the origin of Okinawa soba back to the <a href="/Ry%C5%ABky%C5%AB_Kingdom" title="Ryūkyū Kingdom">Ryūkyū Kingdom</a> period. It is pointed out that Chinese delegates possibly brought wheat noodles to the royal court.&#60;ref name=&#34;miyagi2000&#34;&#62;{{cite journal |author=Miyagi Masayasu 宮城昌保 |title=<i>Ryūkyū no menshoku denpa</i> 琉球の麺食伝播 |journal=風俗史学 Fūzoku Shigaku |issue=13 |pages=61–71 |year=2000 |language=Japanese }}&#60;/ref&#62; However, they fail to establish a link to the modern Okinawan cuisine.&#60;ref name=&#34;nishimura2003&#34;&#62;{{cite journal |author=Nishimura Hidemi 西村秀三 |title=<i>Yuragu genfūkei</i> 揺らぐ原風景|journal=Ajia yūgaku アジア遊学 |issue=53 |pages=73–81 |year=2003 |language=Japanese }}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>The first known documented reference to Okinawa soba is of 1902 or the late <a href="/Meiji_period" title="Meiji period">Meiji period</a>. At that time, it was known as <i>Shina soba</i> (Chinese <i>soba</i>) as in mainland Japan. Several soba restaurants are known to have run in <a href="/Naha" title="Naha">Naha</a> in the <a href="/Taish%C5%8D_period" title="Taishō period">Taishō period</a>. They used to have close links with the red-light district.&#60;ref name=&#34;nishimura2003&#34; /&#62; Soba restaurants were destroyed by U.S. attacks during the <a href="/Battle_of_Okinawa" title="Battle of Okinawa">Battle of Okinawa</a>. Its revival began in U.S. internment camps where wheat rations were supplied. In 1960s soba was popularized with the introduction of noodle making machines. The popularization was accompanied by the transformation from a restaurant meal to home cooking. The mainland Japanese custom of eating soba on New Year&#39;s Eve was introduced to Okinawa in 1968 but buckwheat noodles were replaced by wheat noodles. Today Okinawa soba is considered as a vital part of traditional Okinawan culture although folklorist Nishimura Hidemi argued that it was an <a href="/Invented_traditions" title="Invented traditions">invented tradition</a>.&#60;ref name=&#34;nishimura2003&#34; /&#62;</p>
