<p>A very traditional honey cake from Austria contains an equal weight of white rye flour and dark honey, strong coffee instead of water, cloves, cinnamon, allspice, and golden raisins in the loaf, with slivered almonds on top of the loaf. Of course it also has a fair amount of eggs, vegetable oil (probably corn), salt, and baking powder.</p>
