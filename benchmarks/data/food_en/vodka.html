On April 20, 1999, while smoking a cigarette at the start of lunch break, Brooks Brown saw Harris arrive at school. Brown had severed his friendship with Harris a year earlier because Harris had thrown a chunk of ice at his car windshield; Brown patched things up with Harris just prior to the shooting. Brown scolded Harris for skipping the morning class, because Harris was always serious about schoolwork and being on time. Harris reportedly said, &#34;It doesn&#39;t matter anymore&#34; and also said, &#34;Brooks, I like you now. Get out of here. Go home.&#34;&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web |title=Columbine Survivor With Words for Virginia Students |url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=9658182" rel="nofollow">http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=9658182</a> |date=April 18, 2007 |first=Brooks |last=Brown |publisher=<a href="/National_Public_Radio" title="National Public Radio">NPR</a> |accessdate=August 24, 2008}}&#60;/ref&#62; Brown quickly left the school grounds. At 11:19&#38;nbsp;a.m., he heard the first gunshots after he had walked some distance away from the school, and he informed the police via a neighbor&#39;s cell phone.</p>
<p>By that time, Dylan Klebold had already arrived at the school in a separate car, and the two boys left two gym bags, each containing a 20-pound propane bomb, inside the school cafeteria. When these devices failed to detonate, Harris and Klebold launched a shooting attack against their classmates. It remains the deadliest attack ever perpetrated at an American high school. Harris was responsible for seven of the 13 confirmed deaths (<a href="/Rachel_Scott" title="Rachel Scott">Rachel Scott</a>,  a teacher identified as Dave Sanders, Steve Curnow, <a href="/Cassie_Bernall" title="Cassie Bernall">Cassie Bernall</a>, Isaiah Shoels, Kelly Fleming, and Daniel Mauser), while Klebold was responsible for the remaining six (Dan Rohrbough,Kyle Velasquez, Matthew Kechter, Lauren Townsend, John Tomlin and Corey DePooter). There were 24 wounded, most in critical condition.</p>

<p>At 12:02&#38;nbsp;p.m., Harris and Klebold returned to the library. This was 20 minutes after their lethal shooting spree had ended, leaving 12 students dead, one teacher dying, and another 24 students injured. Ten of their victims had been killed in the library, with their bodies strewn about the floor. Harris and Klebold went to the west windows and opened fire on the police outside. Six minutes later, they walked to the bookshelves near a table where Patrick Ireland lay badly-wounded and unconscious. Student Lisa Kreutz, injured in the earlier library attack, was also in the room, unable to move.</p>
<p>At 12:08&#38;nbsp;p.m., art teacher Patti Nielson, who had locked herself inside a break room with student Brian Anderson and library staff, overheard Harris and Klebold shout out in unison: &#34;One! Two! Three!&#34; followed immediately by the sound of gunfire.&#60;ref name=&#34;FatalFriendship&#34;/&#62; Harris had fired his shotgun through the <a href="/Palate" title="Palate">roof of his mouth</a>, and Klebold had shot himself in the <a href="/Temple_(anatomy)" title="Temple (anatomy)">left temple</a> with his TEC-9 semi-automatic handgun.</p>

The bombs were primed with matches placed at one end. Both had striker tips on their sleeves. When they rubbed against the bomb, the match head would light the fuse. The weekend before the shootings, Harris and Klebold had purchased propane tanks and other supplies from a hardware store for a few hundred dollars. Several residents of the area claimed to have heard glass breaking and buzzing sounds from the Harris family&#39;s garage, which later was concluded to indicate they were constructing pipe bombs. Harris purchased more propane tanks on the morning of the attack.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}</p>

<p>In his journal, Klebold wrote about his view that he and Harris were &#34;god-like&#34; and more highly evolved than every other human being, but his secret journal records self-loathing and suicidal intentions. Page after page was covered in hearts, as he was secretly in love with a Columbine student. Although both had difficulty controlling their anger, Klebold&#39;s anger had led to his being more prone to serious trouble than Harris. Klebold was known to swear at teachers and fight with his boss at <a href="/Blackjack_Pizza" title="Blackjack Pizza">Blackjack Pizza</a>. After their arrest, which both recorded as the most traumatic thing they had ever experienced, Klebold wrote a letter to Harris, saying how they would have so much fun getting revenge and killing cops, and how his wrath from the January arrest would be &#34;god-like&#34;. On the day of the massacre, Klebold wore a black T-shirt which had the word &#34;WRATH&#34; printed in red.&#60;ref name=USAToday/&#62; It was speculated that revenge for the arrest was a possible motive for the attack, and that the pair planned on having a massive gun battle with police during the shooting. Klebold wrote that life was no fun without a little death, and that he would like to spend the last moments of his life in nerve-wracking twists of murder and bloodshed. He concluded by saying that he would kill himself afterward in order to leave the world that he hated and go to a better place. Klebold was described as &#34;hotheaded, but depressive and suicidal.&#34;{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}</p>
<p>Some of the home recorded videos, called &#34;The Basement Tapes&#34;, have been withheld from the public by the police.

<p>Although early media reports attributed the shootings to a desire for revenge on the part of Harris and Klebold for <a href="/Bullying" title="Bullying">bullying</a> that they received, subsequent psychological analysis indicated Harris and Klebold harbored serious psychological problems. According to Dave Cullen, Harris, who conceived the attacks, was a &#34;cold-blooded, predatory psychopath&#34; and an intelligent, <a href="/Superficial_charm" title="Superficial charm">charming</a> liar with &#34;a preposterously grand superiority complex, a revulsion for authority and an excruciating need for control&#34;. In Cullen&#39;s assessment, Harris lacked remorse or empathy for others, and sought to punish them for their perceived inferiority. According to Principal Frank DeAngelis, Harris was &#34;the type of kid who, when he was in front of adults, he&#39;d tell you what you wanted to hear.&#34;&#60;ref name=USAToday/&#62;&#60;ref name=Slate/&#62;</p>
<p>According to Robert Hare, one of the psychologists consulted by the FBI about Harris and Klebold, the media focused on the hatred exhibited by Harris&#39; journal and web site, and interpreted this as an indication that the killings were motivated by revenge. Hare says, &#34;Unlike psychotic individuals, psychopaths are rational and aware of what they are doing and why. Their behavior is the result of choice, freely exercised.&#34; In analyzing the pages of enraged writings in Harris&#39; journals, Hare concludes the writings are not an expression of anger stemming from being ostracized or bullied, but are indicative of a deep superiority complex that seeks to punish the entire human race for its inferiority. Says Hare, &#34;It&#39;s more about demeaning other people.&#34; According to Supervisory Special Agent Dwayne Fuselier, the FBI&#39;s lead Columbine investigator and a clinical psychologist, Harris exhibited a pattern of grandiosity, contempt, and lack of empathy or remorse, distinctive traits of psychopaths that Harris concealed through deception. Fuselier adds that Harris engaged in mendacity not merely to protect himself, as Harris rationalized in his journal, but also for pleasure, as seen when Harris expressed his thoughts in his journal regarding how he and Klebold avoided prosecution for breaking into a van. Other leading psychiatrists concur that Harris was a psychopath.&#60;ref name=Slate/&#62;</p>
