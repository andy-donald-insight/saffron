<p>Pandoro appeared in remote times, the product of the ancient art of <a href="/Baking" title="Baking">breadmaking</a>, as the name, <i>Pan d&#39;oro</i> (&#34;literally: <i>Golden Bread</i>&#34;), suggests. Throughout the <a href="/Middle_Age" title="Middle Age">Middle Ages</a>, white bread was consumed solely by the rich, while the common people could only afford black bread and, often, not even that. Sweet breads were reserved for <a href="/Nobility" title="Nobility">nobility</a>. Breads enriched with <a href="/Egg_(food)" title="Egg (food)">eggs</a>, <a href="/Butter" title="Butter">butter</a> and <a href="/Sugar" title="Sugar">sugar</a> or <a href="/Honey" title="Honey">honey</a> were served in the palaces and were known as &#34;royal bread&#34; or &#34;golden bread&#34;.</p>
<p>The desserts consumed in the 17th century were described in the book <i>Suor Celeste Galilei, Letters to Her Father</i>, published by La Rosa of <a href="/Turin" title="Turin">Turin</a>, and they included &#34;royal bread&#34; made from <a href="/Flour" title="Flour">flour</a>, sugar, butter and eggs. However, the bread was already known and appreciated in the ancient <a href="/Rome" title="Rome">Rome</a> of <a href="/Pliny_the_Elder" title="Pliny the Elder">Pliny the Elder</a>, in the 1st century. That bread was made with &#34;the finest flour combined with eggs, butter and oil&#34;. <a href="/Virgil" title="Virgil">Virgil</a> and <a href="/Livy" title="Livy">Livy</a> mentioned the preparation under the name Libum.</p>
<p>The first citation of a dessert clearly identified as Pandoro dates to the 18th century. The dessert certainly figured in the cuisine of the Venetian <a href="/Aristocracy" title="Aristocracy">aristocracy</a>. <a href="/Venice" title="Venice">Venice</a> was the principal market for <a href="/Spice" title="Spice">spices</a> as late as the 18th century as well as for the sugar that by then had replaced honey in European pastries and breads made from leavened dough. And it was at <a href="/Verona%2C_Italy" title="Verona, Italy">Verona</a>, in Venetian territory, that the formula for making pandoro was developed and perfected, a process that required a century. The modern history of this dessert bread began at Verona on October 30, 1894, when Domenico Melegatti obtained a patent for a procedure to be applied in producing pandoro industrially. Pandoro was also the last meal eaten by the Italian dictator <a href="/Benito_Mussolini" title="Benito Mussolini">Benito Mussolini</a> before his execution in 1945.</p>
