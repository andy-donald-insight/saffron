<p>Most commercially available baking powders are made up of <a href="/Sodium_bicarbonate" title="Sodium bicarbonate">sodium bicarbonate</a> (also known as <a href="/Baking_soda" title="Baking soda">baking soda</a> or bicarbonate of soda) and one or more <a href="/Acid_salt" title="Acid salt">acid salts</a>. Typical formulations (by weight) call for 30% sodium bicarbonate, 5-12% <a href="/Monocalcium_phosphate" title="Monocalcium phosphate">monocalcium phosphate</a>, and 21-26% <a href="/Sodium_aluminium_sulfate" title="Sodium aluminium sulfate">sodium aluminium sulfate</a>. The last two ingredients are acidic: they combine with the sodium bicarbonate and water to produce the gaseous carbon dioxide. The use of two acidic components is the basis of the term &#34;double acting.&#34; Another typical acid in such formulations is <a href="/Cream_of_tartar" title="Cream of tartar">cream of tartar</a>, a derivative of <a href="/Tartaric_acid" title="Tartaric acid">tartaric acid</a>. Baking powders also include components to help with the consistency and stability of the mixture.&#60;ref name=KO&#62;John Brodie, John Godber  &#34;Bakery Processes, Chemical Leavening Agents&#34; in Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology 2001, John Wiley &#38; Sons. {{DOI|10.1002/0471238961.0308051303082114.a01.pub2}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>Commercial baking powder formulations are different from domestic ones, although the principles remain the same.

The inert starch serves several functions in baking powder. Primarily it is used to absorb moisture, and thus prolong shelf life by keeping the powder&#39;s additional alkaline and acidic components dry so as not to react with each other prematurely. A dry powder also flows and mixes more easily. Finally, the added bulk allows for more accurate measurements.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite book | last=McGee| first=Harold | title=On Food and Cooking | edition=revised | year=2004 | page=534 | publisher=Scribner-Simon &#38;amp; Schuster | url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.google.com/books?id=iX05JaZXRz0C&#38;lpg=PP1&#38;pg=PA534#v=onepage&#38;q=&#38;f=false" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/books?id=iX05JaZXRz0C&#38;lpg=PP1&#38;pg=PA534#v=onepage&#38;q=&#38;f=false</a> | accessdate=2009-08-12}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>

With this acid, about two-thirds of the available gas is released within about two minutes of mixing at room temperature.

Further release of gas requires the batter to be heated above 140 degrees F.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web | url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.clabbergirl.com/faq.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.clabbergirl.com/faq.php</a> | title=Frequently Asked Questions | work=Clabber Girl | publisher=<a href="/Clabber_Girl" title="Clabber Girl">Clabber Girl</a> | date=2014 | accessdate=2014-03-29 }}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>

While various baking powders were sold in the first half of the 19th century, our modern variants were discovered by <a href="/Alfred_Bird" title="Alfred Bird">Alfred Bird</a> in 1843. <a href="/August_Oetker" title="August Oetker">August Oetker</a>, a German pharmacist, made baking powder very popular when he began selling his mixture to housewives. The recipe he created in 1891 is still sold as <i>Backin</i> in Germany. Oetker started the mass production of baking powder in 1898 and patented his technique in 1903.</p>
<p>In the US, Joseph and Cornelius Hoagland developed a baking powder with the help of an employee following the American Civil War. Their formula became known as <a href="/Royal_Baking_Powder_Company" title="Royal Baking Powder Company">Royal Baking Powder</a>. The small company eventually moved from Fort Wayne, Indiana to New York in the 1890s and became the largest manufacturer of baking powder in the US.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}</p>
<p><a href="/Eben_Norton_Horsford" title="Eben Norton Horsford">Eben Norton Horsford</a>, a student of <a href="/Justus_von_Liebig" title="Justus von Liebig">Justus von Liebig</a>, who began his studies on baking powder in 1856, eventually developed a variety he named in honor of <a href="/Count_Rumford" title="Count Rumford">Count Rumford</a>. By the mid-1860s &#34;Horsford&#39;s Yeast Powder&#34; was on the market as an already-mixed leavening agent, distinct from separate packages of calcium acid phosphate and sodium bicarbonate. His product was packaged in bottles, but Horsford was interested in using metal cans for packing; this meant the mixture had to be more moisture resistant. This was accomplished by the addition of corn starch, and in 1869 Rumford began the manufacture of what can truly be considered baking powder. In 2006 Rumford Baking Powder was designated a <a href="/National_Historic_Chemical_Landmarks" title="National Historic Chemical Landmarks">National Historic Chemical Landmark</a> in recognition of its significance for making baking easier, quicker, and more reliable.&#60;ref name=&#34;ACS Landmarks&#34;&#62;{{cite web|title=Development of Baking Powder|url=<a class="external free" href="http://portal.acs.org/portal/PublicWebSite/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/bakingpowder/index.htm" rel="nofollow">http://portal.acs.org/portal/PublicWebSite/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/bakingpowder/index.htm</a>|publisher=<a href="/American_Chemical_Society" title="American Chemical Society">American Chemical Society</a>|accessdate=2012-06-06}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>During World War II, Byron H. Smith, an inventor in Bangor, Maine (U.S.), created a substitute product for American housewives, who were unable to obtain cream of tartar or baking powder due to war food shortages. Under the name &#34;Bakewell&#34;, Smith marketed a mixture of sodium pyrophosphate mixed with corn starch to replace the acid cream of tartar component of baking powder. When mixed with baking soda, the product behaved like a single-acting baking powder, the only difference being that the acid is <a href="/Sodium_acid_pyrophosphate" title="Sodium acid pyrophosphate">sodium acid pyrophosphate</a>. A similar product is marketed today, under the name <a href="/Bakewell_Cream" title="Bakewell Cream">Bakewell Cream</a>.</p>

Generally one <a href="/Teaspoon" title="Teaspoon">teaspoon</a> ({{convert|5|g}}) of baking powder is used to <a href="/Leavening" title="Leavening">raise</a> a mixture of one cup (125&#38;nbsp;g) of flour, one cup of liquid, and one egg. However, if the mixture is acidic, baking powder&#39;s additional acids will remain unconsumed in the chemical reaction and often lend an unpleasant taste to food. High acidity can be caused by ingredients like <a href="/Buttermilk" title="Buttermilk">buttermilk</a>, <a href="/Lemon_juice" title="Lemon juice">lemon juice</a>, <a href="/Yogurt" title="Yogurt">yogurt</a>, <a href="/Citrus" title="Citrus">citrus</a> or <a href="/Honey" title="Honey">honey</a>. When excessive acid is present, some of the baking powder should be replaced with baking soda. For example, one cup of flour, one egg, and one cup of buttermilk requires only ½ teaspoon of baking powder—the remaining leavening is caused by buttermilk acids reacting with ¼ teaspoon of baking soda.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}</p>
<p>On the other hand, with baking powders that contain sodium acid pyrophosphate, excess alkaline substances can sometimes <a href="/Deprotonate" title="Deprotonate">deprotonate</a> the acid in two steps instead of the one that normally occurs, resulting in an offensive bitter taste to baked goods. Calcium compounds and aluminium compounds do not have that problem though, since calcium compounds that deprotonate twice are insoluble and aluminium compounds do not deprotonate in that fashion.</p>
<p>Moisture and heat can cause baking powder to lose its effectiveness over time, and commercial varieties have a somewhat arbitrary expiration date printed on the container. Regardless of the expiration date, the effectiveness can be tested by placing a teaspoon of the powder into a small container of hot water. If it bubbles energetically, it is still active and usable.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.finecooking.com/item/5054/baking-powder" rel="nofollow">http://www.finecooking.com/item/5054/baking-powder</a> |title=Baking Powder |accessdate=2009-03-06 | publisher=Fine Cooking | archiveurl= <a class="external free" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20090201093809/http://www.finecooking.com/item/5054/baking-powder" rel="nofollow">http://web.archive.org/web/20090201093809/http://www.finecooking.com/item/5054/baking-powder</a>| archivedate= 1 February 2009 &#60;!--DASHBot--&#62;| deadurl= no}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>Different brands of baking powder can perform quite differently in the oven. In one test, six U.S. brands were used to bake white cake, cream biscuits, and chocolate cookies. Depending on the brand, the thickness of the cakes varied by up to 20 percent (from 0.89 inches to 1.24 inches). It was also found that the lower-rising products made what were judged to be better chocolate cookies.&#60;ref name=&#34;CooksCountry&#34;&#62;{{cite journal |title=Taste Test: Baking Powder |journal=Cook&#39;s Country |year=2015 |last=Savoie |first=Lauren |issue=66 |page=31 |issn=1552-1990 |accessdate=2015-11-21 }}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>

Alternatively, lemon juice can be substituted for some of the liquid in the recipe, to provide the required acidity to activate the baking soda. The main variable with the use of these kitchen acids is the rate of leavening.</p>

<p>In times past, when chemically manufactured baking soda was not available, &#34;ash water&#34; was used instead. Ashes from hardwood trees contain carbonates and bicarbonate salts, which can be extracted with water. This approach became obsolete with the availability of purified baking soda.</p>

Some people prefer not to use baking powder with aluminium because they believe it gives food a vaguely metallic taste and aluminium is not an essential mineral. Others object because of possible <a href="/Aluminium#Health_concerns" title="Aluminium">health concerns</a> associated with aluminium intake. In 2015, an American TV show/magazine evaluated six baking powders marketed to consumers. They reported that 30% of their testers (n=21) noted a metallic flavor in cream biscuits made with brands containing aluminum.&#60;ref name=&#34;CooksCountry&#34;/&#62;</p>
