<p><b>Fusilli</b> {{IPA-it|fuËˆzilli|}} are long, thick, <a href="/Corkscrew" title="Corkscrew">corkscrew</a> <a href="/Shape" title="Shape">shaped</a> <a href="/Pasta" title="Pasta">pasta</a>. The word <i>fusilli</i> presumably comes from <i>fuso</i>, as traditionally it is &#34;spun&#34; by pressing and rolling a small rod over the thin strips of pasta to wind them around it in a corkscrew shape.</p>
<p>In addition to plain and <a href="/Whole_grain" title="Whole grain">whole wheat</a> varieties, as with any pasta, other colours can be made by mixing other ingredients into the dough, which also affects the flavour, for example, <a href="/Beetroot" title="Beetroot">beetroot</a> or <a href="/Tomato" title="Tomato">tomato</a> for red, <a href="/Spinach" title="Spinach">spinach</a> for green, and <a href="/Cuttlefish" title="Cuttlefish">cuttlefish</a> ink for black.</p>
<p><i>Fusilli</i> may be solid or hollow. Hollow <i>fusilli</i> are also called <i>fusilli bucati</i>.</p>
<p>The term <i>fusilli</i> is also used to describe a short, flattened, twisted pasta known as  <a href="/Rotini" title="Rotini">rotini</a> in the United States.
Short twisted pasta are also marketed as fusilli, as well as a tri-color fusilli which is marketed to consumers who want bistro style salads etc. This type of product is widely seen.</p>
