<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Baking_and_ingredients">Baking and ingredients</span></h2>
<p>Carrot cake closely resembles a <a href="/Quick_bread" title="Quick bread">quick bread</a> in method of preparation (all the wet ingredients, such as the eggs and sugar, are mixed, all the dry ingredients are mixed, and the wet are then added to the dry) and final consistency (which is usually denser than a traditional cake and has a coarser <a href="/Bread_crumbs" title="Bread crumbs">crumb</a>).</p>
<p>Many carrot cake recipes include optional ingredients, such as <a href="/Kirsch" title="Kirsch">kirsch</a>, cinnamon, <a href="/Nut_(fruit)" title="Nut (fruit)">nuts</a>, <a href="/Pineapple" title="Pineapple">pineapple</a> or <a href="/Raisins" title="Raisins">raisins</a>. The most common icing on carrot cake is icing sugar and lemon juice or icing sugar and <a href="/Kirsch" title="Kirsch">kirsch</a> (Europe) and an icing with icing sugar, butter and cream cheese (United States).</p>
<p>As the cake is relatively moist, it can be conserved longer than many other types of cakes.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Presentation">Presentation</span></h2>
<p>Carrot cake may be eaten plain, but it is commonly either glazed or topped with white <a href="/Icing_(food)" title="Icing (food)">icing</a> or <a href="/Cream_cheese" title="Cream cheese">cream cheese</a> icing and <a href="/Walnut" title="Walnut">walnuts</a>, usually chopped. It is often coated with icing or <a href="/Marzipan" title="Marzipan">marzipan</a> made to look like carrots. Carrot cake is popular in <a href="/Loaf" title="Loaf">loaf</a>, <a href="/Sheet_cake" title="Sheet cake">sheet cake</a> and <a href="/Cupcake" title="Cupcake">cupcake</a> forms, and (in the United Kingdom, as well as North America) can be found pre-packaged at grocery stores, and fresh at <a href="/Bakery" title="Bakery">bakeries</a>. Some carrot cakes are even <a href="/Layer_cake" title="Layer cake">layered</a>.</p>

<p>{{unreferenced section|date=December 2012}}</p>
<p>Carrots have been used in sweet cakes since the <a href="/Middle_Ages" title="Middle Ages">medieval period</a>, during which time sweeteners were scarce and expensive, while carrots, which contain more sugar than any other vegetable besides the <a href="/Sugar_beet" title="Sugar beet">sugar beet</a>, were much easier to come by and were used to make sweet desserts. The origins of carrot cake are disputed.  Recipes for carrot cake occur as early as 1827.&#60;ref&#62;Antoine B. Beauvilliers, <i>The Art of French Cookery</i> … , 3rd ed. (London, England:  Longman, 1827), <a class="external text" href="http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nyp.33433017317763;view=1up;seq=245" rel="nofollow">page 227.</a>&#60;/ref&#62;   The oldest known recipe of carrot cake dates from 1892, in a book of the housekeeping school of <a href="/Kaiseraugst" title="Kaiseraugst">Kaiseraugst</a> (<a href="/Canton_of_Aargau" title="Canton of Aargau">Canton of Aargau</a>, <a href="/Switzerland" title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>).&#60;ref name=LT&#62;{{fr}} Véronique Zbinden &#34;Patrimoine culiraire suisse (9/14). Rueblitorte, gâteau végétal et fédéral&#34;, <i><a href="/Le_Temps" title="Le Temps">Le Temps</a></i>, Thursday 31 July 2014, page 10.&#60;/ref&#62; According to the <a href="/Culinary_Heritage_of_Switzerland" title="Culinary Heritage of Switzerland">Culinary Heritage of Switzerland</a>, it is one of the most popular cakes in <a href="/Switzerland" title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>, especially for the birthdays of children.&#60;ref name=LT/&#62;</p>
<p>The popularity of carrot cake was probably revived in Great Britain because of <a href="/Rationing_in_the_United_Kingdom" title="Rationing in the United Kingdom">rationing</a> during the <a href="/World_War_II" title="World War II">Second World War</a>.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|author=Lynne Olver |url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.foodtimeline.org/foodcakes.html#carrotcake" rel="nofollow">http://www.foodtimeline.org/foodcakes.html#carrotcake</a> |title=Cake History Notes |publisher=The Food Timeline |date= |accessdate=2012-01-01}}&#60;/ref&#62; Carrot cakes first became commonly available in restaurants and cafeterias in the <a href="/United_States" title="United States">United States</a> in the early 1960s. They were at first a novelty item, but people liked them so much that carrot cake became standard dessert fare.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} In 2005, the American-based television channel <a href="/Food_Network" title="Food Network">Food Network</a> listed carrot cake, with its cream-cheese icing, as number five of the top five fad foods of the 1970s. Carrot cake was voted as the favourite cake in the <a href="/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, according to a survey in the <i><a href="/Radio_Times" title="Radio Times">Radio Times</a></i> in 2011.</p>
<p>Another story indicates that following the <a href="/Second_World_War" title="Second World War">Second World War</a> there was a glut of canned carrots in the United States. A business man named George C. Page hired master bakers to find uses for the cans of carrots. He somehow promoted the idea of carrot cake to help create a demand for the product.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}</p>
