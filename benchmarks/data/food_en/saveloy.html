A <b>saveloy</b> is a type of highly seasoned <a href="/Sausage" title="Sausage">sausage</a>, usually bright red, normally boiled and frequently available in British <a href="/Fish_and_chips" title="Fish and chips">fish and chips</a> shops, occasionally also available fried in <a href="/Batter_(cooking)" title="Batter (cooking)">batter</a>. The word is believed to originate from the Swiss-French <i><a href="/Cervelat" title="Cervelat">cervelas</a></i> or <i>servelat</i>, ultimately from the Latin <i>cerebrus</i>; originally a pig brain sausage particularly associated with Switzerland.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/saveloy" rel="nofollow">http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/saveloy</a> |title=Saveloy - Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date=2012-08-31 |accessdate=2013-03-14}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>Although the saveloy was originally made from pork brains, the typical ingredients from a shop-bought sausage are now pork (58%), water, rusk, British pork fat, potato starch, salt, emulsifiers (tetrasodium diphosphate, disodium diphosphate), white pepper, spices, dried sage (sage), preservatives (sodium nitrite, potassium nitrate), beef collagen casing contains colour (iron oxide). Rusk contains: wheat flour, salt. Wheat flour contains: wheat flour, calcium carbonate, iron, niacin, thiamin.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.tesco.com/groceries/Product/Details/?id=252743823" rel="nofollow">http://www.tesco.com/groceries/Product/Details/?id=252743823</a> |title=Counter Loose Saveloys By Each - Groceries - Tesco Groceries |publisher=Tesco.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-18}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>The taste of a saveloy is similar to that of a <a href="/Hot_dog" title="Hot dog">frankfurter</a> or <a href="/Red_pudding" title="Red pudding">red pudding</a>. It is mostly eaten with <a href="/French_fries" title="French fries">chips</a>.</p>
<p>The saveloy is available in <a href="/Australia" title="Australia">Australia</a> where it is consumed at fairs, <a href="/F%C3%AAte" title="Fête">fêtes</a>, agricultural shows and sporting events, served on a slice of bread or in a bread roll and liberally covered in tomato sauce. At the turn of the 20th century, the saveloy was described in an Australian court case as a &#34;highly seasoned dry sausage originally made of brains, but now young pork, salted&#34;&#60;ref&#62;&#34;Saveloy Reticence&#34; in <i>The Examiner</i>, Launceston, Tas, 14 March 1913, p. 6&#60;/ref&#62; but by the mid-century it was commonly defined by its size (a 19-inch sausage), &#34;as opposed to a Frankfurter, 26&#34; [inches].&#60;ref&#62;&#34;Variety of Sausage for Home Menus&#34; in <i>The Courier Mail</i>, Brisbane, QLD, 12 September 1951, p. 8&#60;/ref&#62;  This distinction may be due to the Frankfurter&#39;s popularisation (as an ingredient of <a href="/Hot_Dog" title="Hot Dog">hot-dogs</a>).&#60;ref&#62;&#34;Hot Dog is Favourite American Sandwich&#34; in the <i>Centralian Advocate</i>, 26 October 1951, p. 12&#60;/ref&#62;  Despite &#34;frankfurter&#34; sausage makers being the target of violence in <a href="/World_War_I" title="World War I">World War I</a>,&#60;ref&#62;&#34;Exciting Night in Sydney&#34; in <i>Barrier Miner</i>, Broken Hill, NSW, 28 November 1915, p. 1&#60;/ref&#62; the story that saveloys were once frankfurters, renamed due to anti-Germanic sentiment is purely apocryphal, as far as Australia is concerned.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}</p>
<p>Saveloys are popular in <a href="/New_Zealand" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a> and <a href="/Australia" title="Australia">Australia</a>, where they are larger than the English type. Although they are sold at fish-and-chips shops as in England, they are commonly bought at butchers&#39; shops or supermarkets and cooked by boiling at home. Saveloys are known colloquially as &#34;savs&#34;. A <b>cheerio</b> is a smaller version, about a quarter of the size, sometimes called a cocktail sausage, baby sav or a &#34;little boy&#34;. These are a popular children&#39;s party food in New Zealand and Australia, often served hot in a sweet, spicy <a href="/Watties#Products" title="Watties">tomato sauce</a>.</p>
<p>Saveloys are also popular in the <a href="/North_East_of_England" title="North East of England">North East of England</a> where it is eaten hot in a sandwich with <a href="/Pease_pudding" title="Pease pudding">pease pudding</a>.
