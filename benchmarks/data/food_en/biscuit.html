<p>The modern-day difference in the English language regarding the word &#34;biscuit&#34; is provided by British cookery writer <a href="/Elizabeth_David" title="Elizabeth David">Elizabeth David</a> in <i>English Bread and Yeast Cookery</i>, in the chapter &#34;Yeast Buns and Small Tea Cakes&#34; and section &#34;Soft Biscuits&#34;. She writes, &#60;blockquote&#62;It is interesting that these soft biscuits (such as scones) are common to <a href="/Scotland" title="Scotland">Scotland</a> and <a href="/Guernsey" title="Guernsey">Guernsey</a>, and that the term biscuit as applied to a soft product was retained in these places, and in America, whereas in England it has completely died out.&#60;ref&#62;Elizabeth David (1977) <i>English Bread and Yeast Cookery</i>, <a href="/Penguin_Books" title="Penguin Books">Penguin Books</a> Ltd., London <a class="external text" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0713910267" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0713910267">ISBN 0-7139-1026-7</a>&#60;/ref&#62;&#60;/blockquote&#62;</p>
<p>The <a href="/Old_French" title="Old French">Old French</a> word <i>bescuit</i> is derived from the <a href="/Latin_language" title="Latin language">Latin</a> words <i>bis</i> (twice) and <i>coquere</i>, <i>coctus</i> (to cook, cooked), and, hence, means &#34;twice-cooked&#34;.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite encyclopedia</p>

<p>However, the <a href="/Dutch_language" title="Dutch language">Dutch language</a> from around 1703 had adopted the word <i>koekje</i> (&#34;little cake&#34;) to have a similar meaning for a similar hard, baked product.&#60;ref name=MWCookie&#62;{{cite web|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cookie" rel="nofollow">http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cookie</a>|title=Cookie|publisher=<a href="/Merriam-Webster" title="Merriam-Webster">Merriam-Webster</a>|accessdate=14 January 2010}}&#60;/ref&#62; The difference between the secondary Dutch word and that of Latin origin is that, whereas the <i>koekje</i> is a cake that rises during baking, the biscuit, which has no raising agent, in general does not (see <a href="/Gingerbread" title="Gingerbread">gingerbread</a>/<a href="/Ginger_biscuit" title="Ginger biscuit">ginger biscuit</a>), except for the expansion of heated air during baking.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}</p>
<p>When continental Europeans began to emigrate to colonial North America, the two words and their &#34;same but different&#34; meanings began to clash. The words <i>cookie</i> or <i>cracker</i> became the words of choice to mean a hard, baked product.  Further confusion has been added by the adoption of the word biscuit for a small leavened bread popular in the United States. According to the American English <a href="/Dictionary" title="Dictionary">dictionary</a> <a href="/Merriam-Webster" title="Merriam-Webster">Merriam-Webster</a>, a cookie is a &#34;small flat or slightly raised cake&#34;.&#60;ref name=MWCookie/&#62; A biscuit is &#34;any of various hard or crisp dry baked product&#34; similar to the American English terms cracker or cookie,&#60;ref name=MWBiscuit/&#62; or &#34;a small quick bread made from dough that has been rolled out and cut or dropped from a spoon&#34;.&#60;ref name=MWBiscuit/&#62;</p>
<p>In a number of other European languages, terms derived from the latin <i>bis coctus</i> refer instead to yet another baked product, similar to the <a href="/Sponge_cake" title="Sponge cake">sponge cake</a>; e.g. Spanish <i>bizcocho</i>, German <i>Biskuitmasse</i>, Russian <i>бисквит</i> (<i>biskvit</i>), Polish <i>biszkopt</i>.</p>
<p>In modern Italian usage, the term <i>biscotto</i> is used to refer to any type of hard twice-baked biscuit, and not only to the <i><a href="/Biscotto" title="Biscotto">cantuccini</a></i> as in the past.</p>

The need for nutritious, easy-to-store, easy-to-carry, and long-lasting foods on long journeys, in particular at sea, was initially solved by taking live food along with a butcher/<a href="/Cook_(profession)" title="Cook (profession)">cook</a>. However, this took up additional space on what were either horse-powered treks or small ships, reducing the time of travel before additional food was required. This resulted in early armies&#39; adopting the style of hunter-<a href="/Foraging" title="Foraging">foraging</a>.</p>
<p>The introduction of the <a href="/Baking" title="Baking">baking</a> of processed cereals including the creation of flour provided a more reliable source of food. <a href="/Egypt" title="Egypt">Egyptian</a> sailors carried a flat, brittle loaf of <a href="/Millet" title="Millet">millet</a> bread called <i>dhourra</i> cake, while the <a href="/Ancient_Rome" title="Ancient Rome">Romans</a> had a biscuit called <i>buccellum</i>.&#60;ref name=RoyNavyMus/&#62; Roman cookbook <i><a href="/Apicius" title="Apicius">Apicius</a></i> describes: &#34;a thick paste of fine wheat flour was boiled and spread out on a plate. When it had dried and hardened, it was cut up and then fried until crisp, then served with honey and pepper.&#34;</p>
<p>Many early physicians believed that most medicinal problems were associated with <a href="/Digestion" title="Digestion">digestion</a>. Hence, for both sustenance and avoidance of illness, a daily consumption of a biscuit was considered good for health.</p>
<p>Hard biscuits soften as they age. To solve this problem, early bakers attempted to create the hardest biscuit possible.

Early biscuits were hard, dry, and unsweetened. They were most often cooked after bread, in a cooling bakers&#39; oven; they were a cheap form of sustenance for the poor.</p>
