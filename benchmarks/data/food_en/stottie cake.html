<p>A <b>Stottie cake</b> or <b>stotty</b> is a type of <a href="/Bread" title="Bread">bread</a> that originated in <a href="/North_East_England" title="North East England">North East England</a>. It is a flat and round loaf, usually about {{convert|30|cm|in|abbr=off}} in diameter and {{convert|4|cm|in|abbr=off}} deep, with an indent in the middle produced by the baker. Elsewhere in the world, bread considered similar to the stottie is known as <i>Oven Bottom Bread</i>. One chief difference is the heavy and <a href="/Dough" title="Dough">dough</a>-like texture of the bread. Though <a href="/Leavening_agent" title="Leavening agent">leavened</a>, its taste and mouth-feel is heavy and very reminiscent of dough.</p>
<p>Stotties tend to be eaten split and filled. Common fillings include <a href="/Ham" title="Ham">ham</a> and <a href="/Pease_pudding" title="Pease pudding">pease pudding</a>,&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.fabflour.co.uk/fab-bread/types-of-bread" rel="nofollow">Types of bread</a> Flour Advisory Board&#60;/ref&#62; but also <a href="/Bacon" title="Bacon">bacon</a>, <a href="/Egg_(food)" title="Egg (food)">egg</a> and <a href="/Sausage" title="Sausage">sausage</a>. The heavy texture of the bread gives it its name. To &#39;stott&#39; is <a href="/Geordie" title="Geordie">Geordie</a> meaning &#39;to bounce&#39;&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.allwords.com/word-stot.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.allwords.com/word-stot.html</a>|title=Definition of stot|work=allwords.com}}&#60;/ref&#62; because if dropped it would (in theory) bounce. <a href="/Stotting" title="Stotting">Stotting</a> is also used by biologists to describe the jumping behaviour of antelopes in response to predators.</p>
<p>Though originating in the North East, stotties can be found in most parts of Britain, although rarely in the south, and have been offered for sale in branches of <a href="/Greggs" title="Greggs">Greggs</a>, <a href="/Morrisons" title="Morrisons">Morrisons</a> and <a href="/Waitrose" title="Waitrose">Waitrose</a>. Stotties sold by supermarkets tend to resemble stottie only in shape: The bread is lighter and more crumbly, resembling a bread roll more faithfully than a baker&#39;s stottie.</p>
