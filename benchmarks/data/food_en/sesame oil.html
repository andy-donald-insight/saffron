<p> Sesame seeds are protected by a capsule which only bursts when the seeds are completely ripe. The ripening time tends to vary, so farmers cut plants by hand and place them together in an upright position to continue ripening until all the capsules have opened. The discovery of an indehiscent (nonshattering) mutant by Langham in 1943 began the work towards development of a high yielding, shatter-resistant variety. Although researchers have made significant progress in sesame breeding, harvest losses due to shattering continue to limit domestic US production.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/afcm/sesame.html" rel="nofollow">Sesame&#60;!-- Bot generated title --&#62;</a>&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>Sesame seeds are primarily produced in developing countries, a factor that has played a role in limiting the creation of large-scale, fully automated oil extraction and processing techniques.&#60;ref name=&#34;springerlink.com&#34;&#62;{{cite journal |last1=Kamal-Eldin |first1=Afaf |last2=Appelqvist |first2=Lars-Åke |year=1195 |title=The effects of extraction methods on sesame oil stability |journal= <a href="/Journal_of_the_American_Oil_Chemists&#39;_Society" title="Journal of the American Oil Chemists&#39; Society">Journal of the American Oil Chemists&#39; Society</a> |volume=72 |issue=8 |pages=967–969 |url= <a class="external free" href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/m2135gr174k75474/" rel="nofollow">http://www.springerlink.com/content/m2135gr174k75474/</a> |doi=10.1007/BF02542076 |accessdate= 2012-04-26 }}&#60;/ref&#62; Sesame oil can be extracted by a number of methods, depending on the materials and equipment available.</p>
<p>In developing countries, sesame oil is often extracted with less-expensive and manually intensive techniques such as hot water flotation, bridge presses, ram presses, the ghani process, or by using a small-scale expeller. In developed countries sesame oil is often extracted using an <a href="/Expeller_press" title="Expeller press">expeller press</a>, larger-scale oil extraction machines, or by pressing followed by chemical solvent extraction.&#60;ref name=&#34;springerlink.com&#34;/&#62;</p>
<p>Sesame oil can also be extracted under low-temperature conditions using an expeller press in a process called cold pressing. This extraction method is popular among <a href="/Raw_foodism" title="Raw foodism">raw food</a> adherents because it avoids exposing the oil to chemical solvents or high temperatures during extraction.</p>
<p>While some manufacturers will further refine sesame oil through solvent extraction, neutralization and bleaching in order to improve its cosmetic aspects, sesame oil derived from quality seeds already possesses a pleasant taste and does not require further purification before it can be consumed. Many consumers prefer unrefined sesame oil due to their belief that the refining process removes important nutrients. Flavour, which was traditionally an important attribute was best in oils produced from mild crushing&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.fao.org/docrep/t4660t/t4660t0b.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.fao.org/docrep/t4660t/t4660t0b.htm</a>|title=Ghani: A traditional method of oil processing in India}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>Sesame oil is one of the more stable natural oils, but can still benefit from refrigeration and limited exposure to light and high temperatures during extraction, processing and storage in order to minimize nutrient loss through oxidation and rancidity. Storage in amber-colored bottles can help to minimize light exposure.</p>
<p>Sesame oil is a <a href="/Polyunsaturated" title="Polyunsaturated">polyunsaturated</a> (PUFA) semi-drying oil. Commercial sesame oil varies in colour from light to deep reddish yellow depending on the colour of the seed processed and the method of milling. Provided the oil is milled from well-cleaned seed, it can be refined and bleached easily to yield a light-coloured limpid oil. Sesame oil is rich in oleic and linoleic acids, which together account for 85% of the total fatty acids. Sesame oil has a relatively high percentage of unsaponifiable matter (1.5-2.3%) in India and in some other European countries. It is obligatory to add sesame oil (5-10%) to margarine and generally to hydrogenated vegetable fats which are commonly used as adulterants for butter or ghee.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Sesame_seed_market">Sesame seed market</span></h3>
<p>As of 2012, sesame seeds sold on the global market for roughly US $0.67/lb.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.alibaba.com/showroom/sesame-seeds-import-price.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.alibaba.com/showroom/sesame-seeds-import-price.html</a> |title=Sesame seeds import price |accessdate=2012-04-26 }}&#60;/ref&#62; This relatively high price reflects a worldwide shortage. Though the market for sesame seed is strong, domestic US production awaits the development of high-yielding nonshattering varieties.
About 65 percent of the annual US sesame crop is processed into oil and 35 percent is used in food.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.agmrc.org/commodities__products/grains__oilseeds/sesame-profile/" rel="nofollow">http://www.agmrc.org/commodities__products/grains__oilseeds/sesame-profile/</a> |title=AgMRC Sesame profile}}&#60;/ref&#62;
The market for sesame oil is mainly located in Asia and the Middle East where the use of domestically produced sesame oil has been a tradition for centuries.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.fediol.eu/web/sesame/1011306087/list1187970115/f1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.fediol.eu/web/sesame/1011306087/list1187970115/f1.html</a> |title=Sesame Oil usage}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Varieties">Varieties</span></h3>
<p>There are many variations in the colour of sesame oil: cold-pressed sesame oil is pale yellow, while Indian sesame oil (gingelly or til oil) is golden, and East Asian sesame oils are commonly a dark brown colour. This dark colour and flavour are derived from roasted/toasted sesame seeds. Cold pressed sesame oil has a different flavour than the toasted oil, since it is produced directly from raw, rather than toasted, seeds.</p>
<p>Sesame oil is traded in any of the forms described above:  Cold-pressed sesame oil is available in Western health shops. Unroasted (but not necessarily cold pressed) sesame oil is commonly used for cooking in the Middle East and can often be found in <a href="/Halal" title="Halal">halal</a> markets. In East Asian countries, different kinds of hot-pressed sesame oil are preferred.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://gernot-katzers-spice-pages.com/engl/Sesa_ind.html" rel="nofollow">Spice Pages: Sesame Seeds (Sesamum indicum)&#60;!-- Bot generated title --&#62;</a>&#60;/ref&#62;</p>

<p>Light sesame oil has a high smoke point and is suitable for deep-frying, while dark sesame oil (from roasted sesame seeds) has a slightly lower smoke point and is unsuitable for deep-frying.
