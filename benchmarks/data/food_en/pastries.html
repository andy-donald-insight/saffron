<p><b>Pastry</b> is a major type of <a href="/Flour_confections" title="Flour confections">bakers&#39; confectionery</a>.

Small <a href="/Tarts" title="Tarts">tarts</a> and other sweet baked products are called <b>pastries</b>. Common pastry dishes include <a href="/Pie" title="Pie">pies</a>, <a href="/Tarts" title="Tarts">tarts</a>, <a href="/Quiche" title="Quiche">quiches</a> and <a href="/Pasty" title="Pasty">pasties</a>.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite book|title=Professional Pastry Chef |author=Bo Friberg|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|isbn=0-471-21825-1}}&#60;/ref&#62;&#60;ref&#62;{{cite book|title=The World Encyclopedia of Food |author= L.

<p>Pastry can also refer to the <b>pastry <a href="/Dough" title="Dough">dough</a></b>,&#60;ref name=&#34;OED&#34;&#62;{{cite web | url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/pastry" rel="nofollow">http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/pastry</a> | title=Definition of &#39;pastry&#39; | publisher=<a href="/Oxford_English_Dictionary" title="Oxford English Dictionary">Oxford English Dictionary</a> | accessdate=7 January 2015}}&#60;/ref&#62; from which such baked products are made. Pastry dough is rolled out thinly and used as a base for baked products. </p>
<p>Pastry is differentiated from <a href="/Bread" title="Bread">bread</a> by having a higher fat content, which contributes to a flaky or crumbly texture.  A good pastry is light and airy and fatty, but firm enough to support the weight of the filling. When making a <a href="/Shortcrust_pastry" title="Shortcrust pastry">shortcrust pastry</a>, care must be taken to blend the fat and flour thoroughly before adding any liquid. This ensures that the flour granules are adequately coated with fat and less likely to develop <a href="/Gluten" title="Gluten">gluten</a>. On the other hand, overmixing results in long gluten strands that toughen the pastry. In other types of pastry such as <a href="/Danish_pastry" title="Danish pastry">Danish pastry</a> and <a href="/Croissant" title="Croissant">croissants</a>, the characteristic flaky texture is achieved by repeatedly rolling out a dough similar to that for <a href="/Yeast" title="Yeast">yeast</a> bread, spreading it with butter, and folding it to produce many thin layers.</p>

<dt><a href="/Flaky_pastry" title="Flaky pastry">Flaky pastry</a></dt>
<dd>Flaky pastry is a simple pastry that expands when cooked due to the number of layers. It bakes into a crisp, buttery pastry. The &#34;puff&#34; is obtained by the shard-like layers of fat, most often butter or shortening, creating layers which expand in the heat of the oven when baked.</dd>
<dt><a href="/Puff_pastry" title="Puff pastry">Puff pastry</a> </dt>
<dd>Puff pastry has many layers that cause it to expand or “puff” when baked. Puff pastry is made using flour, butter, salt, and water. The pastry rises up due to the water and fats expanding as they turn into steam upon heating.&#60;ref name=&#34;Barham2001&#34;&#62;{{cite book|author=Peter Barham|title=The Science of Cooking|url=<a class="external free" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=oGq4v4e7rG8C&#38;pg=PA189" rel="nofollow">http://books.google.com/books?id=oGq4v4e7rG8C&#38;pg=PA189</a>|year=2001|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-540-67466-5|page=189}}&#60;/ref&#62; Puff pastries come out of the oven light, flaky, and tender.</dd>
<dt><a href="/Choux_pastry" title="Choux pastry">Choux pastry</a> </dt>
<dd>Choux pastry is a very light pastry that is often filled with <a href="/Cream" title="Cream">cream</a>. Unlike other types of pastry, choux is in fact closer to a dough before being cooked which gives it the ability to be piped into various shapes such as the <a href="/%C3%89clair_(pastry)" title="Éclair (pastry)">éclair</a> and <a href="/Profiterole" title="Profiterole">profiterole</a>. Its name originates from the French <i>choux</i>, meaning <a href="/Cabbage" title="Cabbage">cabbage</a>, owing to its rough cabbage-like shape after cooking.&#60;ref name=&#34;Suas2009&#34;&#62;{{cite book|author=Michel Suas|title=Advanced Bread and Pastry, 1st ed.: A Professional Approach|url=<a class="external free" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=JM76vm5tH38C" rel="nofollow">http://books.google.com/books?id=JM76vm5tH38C</a>|accessdate=29 October 2013|year=2009|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-1-4180-1169-7|page=504|chapter=Part 4: Pastry}}&#60;/ref&#62;</dd>
<dd>Choux begins as a mixture of milk or water and butter which are heated together until the butter melts, to which flour is added to form a dough. Eggs are then beaten into the dough to further enrich it.  This high percentage of water causes the pastry to expand into a light, hollow pastry. Initially, the water in the dough turns to steam in the oven and causes the pastry to rise; then the starch in the flour <a href="/Starch_gelatinization" title="Starch gelatinization">gelatinizes</a>, thereby solidifying the pastry.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite book|title=Secrets of Eclairs|url=<a class="external free" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=JTr7HrwcVDEC&#38;pg=PT78" rel="nofollow">http://books.google.com/books?id=JTr7HrwcVDEC&#38;pg=PT78</a>|date=1 November 2012|publisher=Murdoch Books|isbn=978-1-74336-424-6|pages=78–}}&#60;/ref&#62;  Once the choux dough has expanded, it is taken out of the oven; a hole is made in it to let the steam out. The pastry is then placed back in the oven to dry out and become crisp. The pastry is filled with various flavors of cream and is often topped with <a href="/Chocolate" title="Chocolate">chocolate</a>. Choux pastries can also be filled with ingredients such as cheese, tuna, or chicken to be used as appetizers.</dd>

Hand-raised hot water crust pastry does not produce a neat and uniform finish, as there will be sagging during the cooking of the filled pie, which is generally accepted as the mark of a hand-made pie.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2007/nov/24/foodanddrink.baking55" rel="nofollow">http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2007/nov/24/foodanddrink.baking55</a>|title=Hot water crust pastry|last=<a href="/Dan_Lepard" title="Dan Lepard">Dan Lepard</a>|date=24 November 2007|work=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian News and Media|accessdate=6 January 2015}}&#60;/ref&#62;</dd>

<p>Different kinds of pastries are made by utilizing the natural characteristics of wheat flour and certain fats. When wheat flour is mixed with water and kneaded into plain dough, it develops strands of gluten, which are what make bread tough and elastic. In a typical pastry, however, this toughness is unwanted, so fat or oil is added to slow down the development of gluten. <a href="/Lard" title="Lard">Lard</a> or <a href="/Suet" title="Suet">suet</a> work well because they have a coarse, crystalline structure that is very effective.

If the fat is melted with hot water or if liquid oil is used, the thin oily layer between the grains offers less of an obstacle to gluten formation and the resulting pastry is tougher.&#60;ref name=&#34;autogenerated1999&#34;&#62;Jaine, Tom, and Soun Vannithone.

<p>The European tradition of pastry-making is often traced back to the shortcrust era of flaky doughs that were in use throughout the Mediterranean in ancient times.</p>
<p>In the ancient Mediterranean, the Romans, Greeks and Phoenicians all had filo-style pastries in their culinary traditions. There is also strong evidence that Egyptians produced pastry-like confections. They had professional bakers that surely had the skills to do so, and they also had needed materials like flour, oil, and honey.{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=June 2012}}
In the plays of <a href="/Aristophanes" title="Aristophanes">Aristophanes</a>, written in the 5th century BC, there is mention of sweetmeats, including small pastries filled with fruit. The <a href="/Ancient_Roman_cuisine" title="Ancient Roman cuisine">Roman cuisine</a> used flour, oil and water to make pastries that were used to cover meats and <a href="/Fowl" title="Fowl">fowls</a> during baking in order to keep in the juices, but the pastry was not meant to be eaten. A pastry that was meant to be eaten was a richer pastry that was made into small pastries containing eggs or little birds and that were often served at banquets. Greeks and Roman both struggled in making a good pastry because they used oil in the cooking process, and oil causes the pastry to lose its stiffness.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.pfisterconsulting.com/history.htm" rel="nofollow">History of Baking and Pastry Cooking&#60;!-- Bot generated title --&#62;</a>&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>In the <a href="/Medieval_cuisine" title="Medieval cuisine">medieval cuisine</a> of Northern Europe, pastry chefs were able to produce nice, stiff pastries because they cooked with shortening and butter. Some incomplete lists of ingredients have been found in medieval cookbooks, but no full, detailed versions. There were stiff, empty pastries called coffins or &#39;<a href="/Huff_paste" title="Huff paste">huff paste</a>&#39;, that were eaten by servants only and included an <a href="/Egg_yolk" title="Egg yolk">egg yolk</a> glaze to help make them more enjoyable to consume. Medieval pastries also included small tarts to add richness.</p>
<p>It was not until about the mid-16th century that actual pastry recipes began appearing.&#60;ref name=&#34;autogenerated1999&#34;/&#62;&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.bakeinfo.co.nz/school/school_info/pastry.php" rel="nofollow">Pastry&#60;!-- Bot generated title --&#62;</a>&#60;/ref&#62;
These recipes were adopted and adapted over time in various European countries, resulting in the myriad pastry traditions known to the region, from Portuguese &#34;<a href="/Pastel_de_nata" title="Pastel de nata">pastéis de nata</a>&#34; in the west to Russian &#34;<a href="/Pirozhki" title="Pirozhki">pirozhki</a>&#34; in the east. The use of chocolate in pastry-making in the west, so commonplace today, arose only after Spanish and Portuguese traders brought chocolate to Europe from the New World starting in the 16th century.

Still, the term &#34;western cake&#34; (西餅) is used to differentiate between the automatically assumed Chinese pastry{{clarify|date=December 2013}}&#60;!--This sentence is not at all clear.--&#62; Other Asian countries such as Korea prepare traditional pastry-confections such as <a href="/Tteok" title="Tteok">tteok</a>, <a href="/Hangwa" title="Hangwa">hangwa</a>, and <a href="/Yaksik" title="Yaksik">yaksik</a> with flour, rice, fruits, and regional specific ingredients to make unique desserts.
