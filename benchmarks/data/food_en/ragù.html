In <a href="/Italian_cuisine" title="Italian cuisine">Italian cuisine</a>, a <b>ragù</b> ({{IPA-it|raˈɡu*|pron}}) is a meat-based sauce, which is commonly served with <a href="/Pasta" title="Pasta">pasta</a>. The Italian gastronomic society l&#39;Accademia Italiana Della Cucina has documented fourteen recipes.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.accademiaitalianacucina.it/index.php" rel="nofollow">Accademia Italiana Della Cucina</a> retrieved 1 March 2012&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>The common characteristic among the recipes is the presence of meat and all are to be used as sauces for pasta. Typically they include <i>ragù alla <a href="/Bologna" title="Bologna">bolognese</a></i> (<a href="/Bolognese_sauce" title="Bolognese sauce">Bolognese sauce</a>), <i>ragù alla <a href="/Naples" title="Naples">napoletana</a></i> (<a href="/Neapolitan_rag%C3%B9" title="Neapolitan ragù">Neapolitan ragù</a>), and <i>ragù alla <a href="/Bari" title="Bari">Barese</a></i> (sometimes made with <a href="/Horse_meat" title="Horse meat">horse meat</a>).</p>
<p>In the northern Italian regions, a ragù is typically a sauce of meat, often minced, chopped or ground, and cooked with <a href="/Sauteed" title="Sauteed">sauteed</a> vegetables in a liquid. The meats are varied and may include separately or in mixtures of beef, chicken, pork, duck, goose, lamb, mutton, veal, or game, as well as offal from any of the same. The liquids can be broth, stock, water, wine, milk, cream, or tomato, and often includes combinations of these. If tomatoes are included, they are typically limited in quantity relative to the meat. Characteristically, a ragù is a sauce of braised or stewed meat that may be flavoured with tomato, to distinguish it from a tomato sauce that is flavoured with the addition of meat.</p>
<p>In southern Italian regions, especially Campania, ragùs are often prepared from substantial quantities of large, whole cuts of beef and pork, and possibly regional sausages, cooked with vegetables and tomatoes. After a long braise (or simmer), the meats are then removed and may be served as a separate course without pasta. Examples of these styles of ragùs are the well-known <i>ragù alla Napoletana</i> (<a href="/Neapolitan_rag%C3%B9" title="Neapolitan ragù">Neapolitan ragù</a>) and <i>carne a ragù</i>.&#60;ref&#62;Accademia Italiana della Cuisine, <i>La Cucina - The Regional Cooking of Italy</i> (English translation), 2009, Rizzoli, <a class="external text" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/9780847831470" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/9780847831470">ISBN 978-0-8478-3147-0</a>&#60;/ref&#62;</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Origin_and_history">Origin and history</span></h2>
<p>Ragù as pasta sauces in Italian cuisine, likely arose from the influence and status of French <i><a href="/Rago%C3%BBt" title="Ragoût">ragoûts</a></i> in the region of <a href="/Emilia-Romagna" title="Emilia-Romagna">Emilia-Romagna</a> in the late 18th century, following <a href="/Napoleon_Bonaparte" title="Napoleon Bonaparte">Napoleon</a>&#39;s 1796 invasion and possession of the northern regions of what is now Italy.&#60;ref name=Kasper&#62;Kasper, Lynne Rossetto, <i>The Spendid Table</i>, Morrow, <a class="external text" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0688089631" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0688089631">ISBN 0-688-08963-1</a>&#60;/ref&#62; Prior to that time, the cuisine of the Italian peninsula had a long history of meat stews going back to the Renaissance period. However, they were neither known as &#39;ragù&#39; nor is there any record they were ever paired with pasta. Since the 16th century, it was not uncommon for pasta to be cooked in and served with a meat broth, often like a simple soup, from which the meat was removed and served separately, if eaten at all. The first documented recipe for a meat sauce, in which the cooked meat was an integral part of the sauce served with pasta, dates to the end of the 18th century. That first ragù as a sauce, <i>ragù for maccheroni</i>, was prepared and recorded by Alberto Alvisi, the cook to the Cardinal of Imola (at the time <i>maccheroni</i> was a general term for pasta, both dried and fresh). The recipe has been replicated and published as <i>The Cardinal&#39;s Ragù</i>.&#60;ref name=Kasper /&#62;&#60;ref name=KasperWeb&#62;{{cite web|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.splendidtable.org/recipes/the-cardinals-ragu" rel="nofollow">http://www.splendidtable.org/recipes/the-cardinals-ragu</a>|title=The Cardinal&#39;s Ragu {{!}} The Splendid Table|author=Kasper, Lynne Rossetto|publisher=American Public Media|accessdate=9 October 2013}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>After the early 1830s, recipes for ragù appear frequently in cookbooks from the Emilia-Romagna region. By the late 19th century, the use of heavy meat sauces on pasta was common on both <a href="/Feast_day" title="Feast day">feast days</a> and Sundays, with the wealthier classes of the newly unified Italy.&#60;ref name=Zanini&#62;Zanini De Vita, Oretta, <i>Encyclopedia of Pasta</i>, University of California Press, <a class="external text" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/9780520255227" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/9780520255227">ISBN 9780520255227</a>&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>Research by both Kasper&#60;ref name=Kasper /&#62; and Zanini De Vita&#60;ref name=Zanini /&#62; indicates while ragù with pasta gained popularity through the 19th century, they were largely eaten by the wealthy, until the industrial revolution in the very late 19th century, made flour for pasta more affordable for the less affluent. The adoption of pasta by the common classes, further expanded in the period of economic prosperity that followed the end of <a href="/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a>. Zanini De Vita notes that, before World War II, 80% of the Italian rural population ate a diet based on plants; pasta was reserved for special feast days and was then often served in a legume soup.</p>
