<p><b>Seed cake</b> is a traditional <a href="/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">British</a> <a href="/Cake" title="Cake">cake</a> flavoured with <a href="/Caraway" title="Caraway">caraway</a> or other flavourful seeds.  Caraway seeds have been long used in British cookery, and at one time caraway-seed biscuits were prepared to mark the end of the sowing of the spring wheat. These particular biscuits later evolved into this distinctively flavoured tea cake.</p>
<p>James Matterer reports that recipes for seed cake are found in A.W.&#39;s <i>Book of Cookrye</i> (1591) and <i>The English Huswife</i> by Gervase Markham (1615).&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web</p>
