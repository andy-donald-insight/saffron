<b>Jagdwurst</b> (which means <i>hunting sausage</i>) is a <a href="/Germany" title="Germany">German</a> cooked sausage made of lean <a href="/Beef" title="Beef">beef</a> and <a href="/Pork" title="Pork">pork</a>, as well as belly of pork, salt, pepper, garlic, mustard seed, capsicum, mace, cardamom and water, which makes the sausage juicy. Part of the meat is very finely minced, but another part retains its structure. Jagdwurst contains about 20 percent fat.</p>
<p>In the regions of the former <a href="/East_Germany" title="East Germany">GDR</a> (eastern Germany), a common dish is sliced Jagdwurst coated in <a href="/Breadcrumb" title="Breadcrumb">breadcrumbs</a> (normally mixed with <a href="/Egg_(food)" title="Egg (food)">egg</a>) and fried, often in <a href="/Butter" title="Butter">butter</a>. Jagdwurst in this form is called <i>Jägerschnitzel</i> (<i>Hunter&#39;s schnitzel</i>) and should not be confused with true <a href="/J%C3%A4gerschnitzel" title="Jägerschnitzel">Jägerschnitzel</a>, veal schnitzel served with dark mushroom sauce.</p>
<p>Jagdwurst can also be served on fresh buttered bread or breakfast rolls with a hint of mustard. Construction workers in Germany would carry a pocket knife with their lunch box, which contained a small roll of Jagdwurst, buttered bread slices and German mustard and perhaps even beer. Jagdwurst can also be cubed and cooked with onions and mushrooms and served over mashed potatoes, with cheese on top.</p>
