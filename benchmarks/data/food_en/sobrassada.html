<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History_of_sobrassada_and_Majorcan_penchant_for_pork">History of sobrassada and Majorcan penchant for pork</span></h2>
<p>After centuries of Muslim rule with pork banned, Majorca quickly returned to pork consumption in the <a href="/Middle_Ages" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a>, with the key ingredient <a href="/Paprika" title="Paprika">paprika</a> added after the discovery of America in the 15th century. Sobrassada is thought to have originated and expanded, as a culinary concept, in the Aragon Crown-controlled Western Mediterranean (Sicily, Balearic Islands, Sardinia) after the 14th century, as similar sausages are still made in this region.</p>
<p>In a traditional <a href="/Mediterranean_diet" title="Mediterranean diet">Mediterranean diet</a>, containing little meat, as Majorca had until the 1950s, sobrassada and related pork sausages were the main and sometimes only sources of pork for Majorcans. Larger meat cuts such as pork or lamb roasts, <a href="/Pork_steak" title="Pork steak">pork steaks</a> or beef cuts were largely festive dishes, or restricted to the well-off. Even today dishes such as <i>porcella rostida</i>, a whole roasted suckling pig, are only served on special occasions.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Ingredients_and_varieties">Ingredients and varieties</span></h2>
<p>Sobrassada is made with a choice of pork loin, pork bacon (locally called <i>xuia</i>), minced and mixed with paprika, salt and black pepper at the ends (to deter insects). Some makers also add cayenne pepper to the mixture and market it as <i>coent</i>, hot. Then the mixture is put into a pork intestine, and hung from a pole for some weeks until it is cured. The string which is tied around the intestine can be used to differentiate between the hot and <i>dolç</i> (literally &#34;sweet&#34;, though in this case meaning &#34;not spicy&#34;) varieties, the red or red and white string being the hot one.</p>
<p>Small, thin sobrassadas are called <i>llonganissa</i>, and are made from the small intestine. Bigger and thicker ones are called <i>cular</i> or <i>pultrums</i>, and the largest type are huge <a href="/Pig_bladder" title="Pig bladder">pork bladders</a> called <i>bufetes</i> or <i>bisbe</i> (bishop). Thicker varieties take longer to cure, staggering its consumption through the year (thinner during winter, thicker during summer-autumn).</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Sobrassada_outside_the_Balearic_Islands">Sobrassada outside the Balearic Islands</span></h2>
<p>Four geographical areas in the Mediterranean, apart from the Balearic Islands, have close links to sobrassada for different reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>In colonial <a href="/Algeria" title="Algeria">Algeria</a>, sobrassada, named <i>soubressade</i>, was part of the <a href="/Pied-noir" title="Pied-noir">pied-noir</a> cuisine and extremely popular until the independence and re-Islamisation of the country; pork is forbidden by Islam. Today soubressade can only be found in continental France, in butcher shops run by <a href="/Pied-noirs" title="Pied-noirs">pied-noirs</a>.</li>
<li>In <a href="/Catalonia" title="Catalonia">Catalonia</a>, due to cultural links with the Balearic Islands, sobrassada and other native pork products can be found. The eastern Pyrenees are known for a mountain version of sobrassada.</li>
<li>The village of <a href="/T%C3%A0rbena" title="Tàrbena">Tàrbena</a>, in the province of <a href="/Alicante_(province)" title="Alicante (province)">Alicante</a>, was re-populated after the <a href="/Expulsion_of_the_Moriscos" title="Expulsion of the Moriscos">expulsion of the Moriscos</a> with colonists from <a href="/Majorca" title="Majorca">Majorca</a>, who brought along several traditions from the island, including their own variant of the <a href="/Catalan_language" title="Catalan language">Catalan language</a> and foods such as sobrasada, still made there.</li>
<li>In the island of <a href="/Sicily" title="Sicily">Sicily</a> and in <a href="/Calabria" title="Calabria">Calabria</a>, a similar sausage has been made under the name <a href="/Soppressata" title="Soppressata">soppressata</a> since the 15th century or longer. There is debate over which is the original version.</li>
</ol>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Botifarr.C3.B3_and_other_Majorcan_sausages">Botifarró and other Majorcan sausages</span></h2>
<p>Botifarró is a pork intestine filled with coarsely ground pork cuts, including liver, and spiced with salt, pepper and <a href="/Aniseed" title="Aniseed">aniseed</a>, which gives this sausage its characteristic flavor. The sausages are boiled and eaten immediately. Botifarró is specific to Majorca, but very similar sausages can be found in the Spanish provinces of <a href="/Tarragona_(province)" title="Tarragona (province)">Tarragona</a>, <a href="/Castell%C3%B3n_(province)" title="Castellón (province)">Castellón</a>, <a href="/Valencia_(province)" title="Valencia (province)">Valencia</a> and <a href="/Alicante_(province)" title="Alicante (province)">Alicante</a>. Other pork products typical from the cuisine of Majorca are <i>camaïot</i>, <i>veria negra</i> and <i>xuia</i> (<a href="/Pancetta" title="Pancetta">pancetta</a>).</p>
