A <b>Belgian bun</b> is a <a href="/Sweet_roll" title="Sweet roll">sweet bun</a> containing <a href="/Sultana_(grape)" title="Sultana (grape)">sultanas</a> and usually topped with fondant <a href="/Icing_(food)" title="Icing (food)">icing</a> and half a <a href="/Candied_fruit" title="Candied fruit">glace cherry</a>. The bun is round or square shaped, with rounded off edges, making it similar in appearance to a <a href="/Chelsea_bun" title="Chelsea bun">Chelsea bun</a>. It is also sometimes served with cream. No firm link has so far been established between the bun and <a href="/Belgium" title="Belgium">Belgium</a>; however, that country does produce as one of its specialties a very similar dessert (though with less icing) known as a <a href="/Couque_suisse" title="Couque suisse">couque suisse</a>. </p>
