<p><b>Sussex Pond Pudding</b> is a traditional <a href="/England" title="England">English</a> pudding believed to originate from the South East county of <a href="/Sussex" title="Sussex">Sussex</a>. Made of a <a href="/Suet" title="Suet">suet</a> pastry which encases a whole lemon, with butter and sugar, it is boiled or <a href="/Steaming" title="Steaming">steamed</a> for several hours.</p>
<p>This rich and heavy pudding has gone out of fashion over the years due to health and diet consciousness, although there are many chefs in <a href="/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">Britain</a>, such as the British chef <a href="/Heston_Blumenthal" title="Heston Blumenthal">Heston Blumenthal</a>, who are trying to revive this type of traditional cookery.</p>
<p>Some cooks like to add currants to the filling, though there is some argument about whether this makes it more a <i><a href="/Kentish" title="Kentish">Kentish</a> Puddle Pudding</i> or <i>Kentish Well Pudding</i>.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://adambalic.typepad.com/the_art_and_mystery_of_fo/2007/01/post.html" rel="nofollow">The Art and Mystery of Food</a>&#60;/ref&#62;</p>

<p>While cooking, the filling ingredients create a thick, <a href="/Caramelized" title="Caramelized">caramelized</a> sauce, which upon serving and cutting of the pudding, runs out and pools around the plate, creating a “pond”.  After cooking for so long, the skin of the lemon almost candies like a <a href="/Marmalade" title="Marmalade">marmalade</a> in its own juices and that of the butter and sugar.</p>
<p>The most authentic recipes call for beef suet for making the pastry which is available in all supermarkets in the UK, but vegetable shortening, or even cold butter, can be substituted for similar results.</p>
<p>The best lemons to use in this pudding are thin skinned, juicy ones that have not been waxed.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>
<p>The first recorded recipe for the Sussex Pond Pudding was in <a href="/Hannah_Woolley" title="Hannah Woolley">Hannah Woolley</a>&#39;s <i>The Queen-Like Closet</i> (1672).&#60;ref name=&#34;TFoE-SPP&#34;&#62;{{cite web|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.foodsofengland.co.uk/sussexpondpudding.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.foodsofengland.co.uk/sussexpondpudding.htm</a>|title=Sussex Pond Pudding|publisher=The Foods of England Project|accessdate=11 March 2014}}&#60;/ref&#62;  The recipe suggests encasing a whole apple.&#60;ref name=&#34;TFoE-SPP&#34;/&#62;</p>
<p>Much older cookery books and recipes do not actually call for use of a lemon at all.  Here is one found by Florence White:&#60;ref&#62; <i>Good Things in England</i>, Florence White, First Futura Publications, 1974 Edition &#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p><i>”This was given us at <a href="/Chailey" title="Chailey">Chailey</a>, Sussex, by a nursemaid in 1880 or thereabouts.  It was made for me boiled in a cloth (the correct way) in 1905 by an old cottage woman in the village of <a href="/Westham" title="Westham">Westham</a>.  In Sussex cottages, steak and kidney puddings are still (1931) boiled in a cloth only.”</i> –H.J. Glover
{{Clarify|date=March 2011|Reason=Quote does not seem to match claim: first part does not mention ingredients (so how do we know it did not contain a lemon?), and anyway not clear that it applies to a pond pudding (if no lemon, is it a pond pudding at all anyway?)  Final part is clearly not a pond pudding at all: it&#39;s just a cloth-boiled steak and kidney pudding which happens to have been made in Sussex.  Is the whole quote not just about suet puddings in general?  And isn&#39;t this quote from Florence White: so who is H J Glover?}}&#60;br/&#62;</p>
<p>The first recorded use of a version using a whole lemon was in <a href="/Jane_Grigson" title="Jane Grigson">Jane Grigson</a>&#39;s <i>English Food</i> (1974).&#60;ref name=&#34;TFoE-SPP&#34;/&#62;</p>
