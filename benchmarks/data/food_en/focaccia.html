<p>The common-known focaccia is <i>salt focaccia</i>. Focaccia <a href="/Dough" title="Dough">doughs</a> are similar in style and texture to <a href="/Pizza" title="Pizza">pizza</a> doughs, consisting of <a href="/Flour#Wheat_flour" title="Flour">high-gluten flour</a>, <a href="/Cooking_oil" title="Cooking oil">oil</a>, <a href="/Water" title="Water">water</a>, <a href="/Salt" title="Salt">salt</a> and <a href="/Baker&#39;s_yeast" title="Baker&#39;s yeast">yeast</a>. It is typically rolled out or pressed by hand into a thick layer of dough and then baked in a <a href="/Masonry_oven" title="Masonry oven">stone-bottom</a> or hearth <a href="/Oven" title="Oven">oven</a>. Bakers often puncture the bread with a knife to relieve bubbling on the surface of the bread.</p>
<p>Also common is the practice of dotting the bread. This creates multiple wells in the bread by using a finger or the handle of a utensil to poke the unbaked dough. As a way to preserve moisture in the bread, <a href="/Olive_oil" title="Olive oil">olive oil</a> is then spread over the dough, by hand or with a <a href="/Pastry_brush" title="Pastry brush">pastry brush</a> prior to rising and baking. In the northern part of Italy, <a href="/Lard" title="Lard">lard</a> will sometimes be added to the dough, giving the focaccia a softer, slightly flakier texture. Focaccia recipes are widely available, and with the popularity of <a href="/Bread_machine" title="Bread machine">bread machines</a>, many cookbooks now provide versions of dough recipes that do not require hand <a href="/Kneading" title="Kneading">kneading</a>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Comparison_with_pizza">Comparison with pizza</span></h2>

<p>The primary difference between conventional pizza (round, <a href="/Neapolitan_pizza" title="Neapolitan pizza">Neapolitan pizza</a>) and focaccia is that pizza dough uses very little <a href="/Leavening_agent" title="Leavening agent">leavening</a> (<a href="/Baker%E2%80%99s_yeast" title="Baker’s yeast">baker’s yeast</a>), resulting in a very thin, flat and flexible crust, while focaccia dough uses more leavening, causing the dough to rise significantly higher. The added leavening firms the crust and gives focaccia the capacity to absorb large amounts of olive oil. Unleavened pizza dough is already too dense to absorb much olive oil. A conventional loaf of bread is too tall to absorb olive oil all the way through to its center. Being shorter in height than a conventional loaf and less dense than a pizza dough, focaccia can indeed absorb olive oil all the way to its center or at least nearly so. As such, focaccia might well be thought of as &#34;olive oil bread&#34;.</p>
<p>Focaccia is most often square whereas conventional pizza is more commonly round. Focaccia most often employs more salt than pizza.</p>
<p>There exist traditional Italian pizza recipes, incorporating more leavening, in amounts similar to focaccia, especially in southern Italy, and specifically <i>sfinciuni</i> (<a href="/Sicilian_pizza" title="Sicilian pizza">Sicilian pizza</a>). If these leavened pizzas were to incorporate equivalent amounts of olive oil in the dough, they would be very similar to a focaccia, except perhaps for the herbs or toppings used. Similarly any &#34;thick-crust&#34; pizza that incorporates large amounts of olive oil would be very similar to focaccia, again except for the variance in the herbs and toppings employed.</p>
<p>Contrary to pizza where more than one topping is often found mixed on the same pizza, toppings are not commonly mixed on one focaccia although one topping and one herb might be mixed. Whereas pizza often has toppings peppered only intermittently on its surface, on focaccia, a single topping is often layered more uniformly and thick.</p>

<p>In <a href="/Ancient_Rome" title="Ancient Rome">Ancient Rome</a>, <i>panis focacius</i>&#60;ref name=&#34;Panis focacius&#34;/&#62; was a flat bread baked on the hearth.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|title=A Short History of Focaccia Bread|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.bighistory.net/a-short-history-of-focaccia-bread/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bighistory.net/a-short-history-of-focaccia-bread/</a>|work=Big History|publisher=WordPress|accessdate=2012-03-22}}&#60;/ref&#62; The word is derived from the Latin <i>focus</i> meaning &#34;hearth, place for baking.&#34;&#60;ref&#62;<i><a href="/Oxford_Latin_Dictionary" title="Oxford Latin Dictionary">Oxford Latin Dictionary</a></i> (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1982, 1985 reprinting, p. 718.&#60;/ref&#62;  The basic recipe is thought by some to have originated with the <a href="/Etruscans" title="Etruscans">Etruscans</a> or ancient <a href="/Greeks" title="Greeks">Greeks</a>, but today it is widely associated with <a href="/Liguria" title="Liguria">Ligurian</a> <a href="/Cuisine" title="Cuisine">cuisine</a>.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|title=History of Focaccia Bread|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.abigailsbakery.com/bread-recipes/history-of-focaccia-bread.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.abigailsbakery.com/bread-recipes/history-of-focaccia-bread.htm</a>|publisher=Abigail&#39;s Bakery|accessdate=2012-03-22}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>As the tradition spread, the different dialects and diverse local ingredients resulted in a large variety of bread (some may even be considered cake). Due to the number of small towns and hamlets dotting the coast of Liguria, the focaccia recipe has fragmented into countless variations (from the biscuit-hard <i>focaccia di <a href="/Camogli" title="Camogli">Camogli</a></i> to the oily softness of the one made in <a href="/Voltri" title="Voltri">Voltri</a>), with some bearing little resemblance to its original form. The most extreme example is a specialty called <i>focaccia col formaggio</i> (&#34;focaccia with cheese&#34;) which is made in <a href="/Recco" title="Recco">Recco</a>, near <a href="/Genoa" title="Genoa">Genoa</a>. Other than the name, this Recco version bears no resemblance to other focaccia varieties, having a <a href="/Curd" title="Curd">caillé</a> and cheese filling sandwiched between two layers of paper-thin dough. It is even being considered for <a href="/European_Union" title="European Union">European Union</a> <a href="/Protected_Geographical_Status" title="Protected Geographical Status">PGI</a> status.</p>
<p>Out of Liguria, focaccia comes in many regional variations and its recipe, its texture, its flavor remarkably varies from north to south of Italy. In some parts of the <a href="/Northwest_Italy" title="Northwest Italy">Northwest</a>, for example, a popular recipe is <i>focaccia dolce</i> (&#34;sweet focaccia&#34;), consisting of a basic focaccia base and sprinkled lightly with sugar, or including <a href="/Raisin" title="Raisin">raisins</a>, <a href="/Honey" title="Honey">honey</a>, or other sweet ingredients.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|title=Focaccia Bread|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.bread-maker.net/Bread-Types/Focaccia-Bread.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.bread-maker.net/Bread-Types/Focaccia-Bread.htm</a>|accessdate=22 March 2012}}&#60;/ref&#62; Another sweet focaccia from the <a href="/Northeast_Italy" title="Northeast Italy">Northeast</a> is <i>focaccia veneta</i> (&#34;<a href="/Veneto" title="Veneto">Venetian</a> focaccia&#34;), a typical cake of thee Venetian <a href="/Easter" title="Easter">Easter</a> tradition: it is based on eggs, sugar and butter (instead of olive oil and salt) and it looks quite similar to <a href="/Panettone" title="Panettone">panettone</a> or to another Venetian cake like <a href="/Pandoro" title="Pandoro">pandoro</a>.</p>
<p>In westernmost regions of Italy, across the <a href="/France" title="France">French</a> border, so-called <i>focaccia</i>, <i>fougasse</i> or <i>tarte glacée</i> (&#34;glazed cake&#34; in French) is a <a href="/Christmas" title="Christmas">Christmas</a> and <a href="/New_Year&#39;s_Eve" title="New Year&#39;s Eve">New Year&#39;s Eve</a> cake topped by a sugar and egg-white glaze, commercially known as <i>focaccia di <a href="/Susa_Valley" title="Susa Valley">Susa</a></i>. A <a href="/Ciambella" title="Ciambella">ciambella</a> shaped version is called <i>tarte couronne</i> or <i>couroun</i>.</p>
<p>In <a href="/South_Tyrol" title="South Tyrol">South Tyrol</a> and in the small village of <a href="/Krimml" title="Krimml">Krimml</a> in <a href="/Austria" title="Austria">Austria</a>, the so-called <i>Osterfochaz</i> (in Krimml <i>Fochiz</i>) is the traditional Easter gift of the Godparents to their Godchildren. Therefore, the bread is slightly thinner in the middle, in order to put in the coloured Easter eggs.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external free" href="http://www.familien-feiern-feste.net/156d763.html&#60;/ref&#38;gt" rel="nofollow">http://www.familien-feiern-feste.net/156d763.html&#60;/ref&#38;gt</a>;</p>
<p>Back to olive oil- and salt-based <i>focacce</i> (e.g. <i>focaccia alla genovese</i>, originated in <a href="/Genoa" title="Genoa">Genoa</a>), the <a href="/Southern_Italy" title="Southern Italy">Southern Italian</a> cuisine has its own specialties as well. <i>Focaccia alla messinese</i> is a typical focaccia from <a href="/Messina" title="Messina">Messina</a>, while <i>focaccia barese</i> or <i>focaccia alla barese</i> is common in the provinces of <a href="/Bari" title="Bari">Bari</a>, <a href="/Brindisi" title="Brindisi">Brindisi</a>, <a href="/Lecce" title="Lecce">Lecce</a> and <a href="/Taranto" title="Taranto">Taranto</a>. This latest focaccia is at least partially made with <a href="/Durum" title="Durum">durum</a> wheat flour and usually comes in three variations: classic <i>focaccia</i> with fresh <a href="/Tomato" title="Tomato">tomatoes</a> and often <a href="/Olives" title="Olives">olives</a>, <i>potato focaccia</i> with <a href="/Potato" title="Potato">potato</a> slices 5&#38;nbsp;mm thick and <i>white focaccia</i> with salt grains and <a href="/Rosemary" title="Rosemary">rosemary</a>. Some other variations include <a href="/Bell_pepper" title="Bell pepper">peppers</a>, <a href="/Onion" title="Onion">onions</a>, <a href="/Eggplant" title="Eggplant">eggplant</a> or other vegetables, while the <a href="/Sicilian-style_pizza" title="Sicilian-style pizza">Sicilian-style pizza</a> and the <a href="/Rome" title="Rome">Roman</a> <i>pizza bianca</i> (&#34;white pizza&#34;) can be extensively considered as variants of focaccia as well.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in <a href="/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a>, <a href="/Fougasse_(bread)" title="Fougasse (bread)">fougasse</a> is a typical bread from <a href="/Provence" title="Provence">Provence</a> and from the <a href="/French_cuisine" title="French cuisine">French cuisine</a> as a whole, also known as <i>fogassa</i>, <i>foisse</i> or <i>fouaisse</i> in local variations (e.g. in <a href="/Burgundy" title="Burgundy">Burgundy</a> and <a href="/Languedoc" title="Languedoc">Languedoc</a>); the name <i>fogassa</i> is also used in <a href="/Catalonia" title="Catalonia">Catalonia</a>, while <a href="/Spain" title="Spain">Spaniards</a> call this bread <i>hogaza</i>.</p>
<p>As an aftermath of the <a href="/Italian_diaspora" title="Italian diaspora">Italian diaspora</a> in the <a href="/Americas" title="Americas">Americas</a>, focaccia is also consumed in the <a href="/United_States" title="United States">United States</a>, where it sometimes referred to as <i>focaccia bread</i>.
