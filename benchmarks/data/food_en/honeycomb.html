If the honeycomb is too worn out, the wax can be reused in a number of ways, including making sheets of comb <a href="/Wax_foundation" title="Wax foundation">foundation</a> with hexagonal pattern. Such foundation sheets allow the bees to build the comb with less effort, and the hexagonal pattern of worker-sized cell bases discourages the bees from building the larger drone cells.

<p>
The axes of honeycomb cells are always quasihorizontal, and the nonangled rows of honeycomb cells are always horizontally (not vertically) aligned.  Thus, each cell has two vertical walls, with &#34;floors&#34; and &#34;ceilings&#34; composed of two angled walls&#60;sup&#62;(disparity with image &#34;Honeycomb-Process&#34;)&#60;/sup&#62;. The cells <a href="/Slope" title="Slope">slope</a> slightly upwards, between 9 and 14°, towards the open ends.</p>
<p>Two possible explanations exist as to why honeycomb is composed of hexagons, rather than any other shape. First, the hexagonal <a href="/Tessellation" title="Tessellation">tiling</a> creates a partition with equal-sized cells, while minimizing the total <a href="/Perimeter" title="Perimeter">perimeter</a> of the cells. Known in <a href="/Geometry" title="Geometry">geometry</a> as the <a href="/Honeycomb_conjecture" title="Honeycomb conjecture">honeycomb conjecture</a>, this was given by <a href="/Jan_Bro%C5%BCek" title="Jan Brożek">Jan Brożek</a> and proved much later by <a href="/Thomas_Callister_Hales" title="Thomas Callister Hales">Thomas Hales</a>. Thus, a hexagonal structure uses the least material to create a lattice of cells within a given <a href="/Volume" title="Volume">volume</a>.  A second reason, given by <a href="/D&#39;Arcy_Wentworth_Thompson" title="D&#39;Arcy Wentworth Thompson">D&#39;Arcy Wentworth Thompson</a>, is that the shape simply results from the process of individual bees putting cells together: somewhat analogous to the boundary shapes created in a field of <a href="/Soap_bubble" title="Soap bubble">soap bubbles</a>. In support of this, he notes that queen cells, which are constructed singly, are irregular and lumpy with no apparent attempt at efficiency.&#60;ref&#62;Thompson, D&#39;Arcy Wentworth (1942). On Growth and Form. Dover Publications. ISBN.&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>The closed ends of the honeycomb cells are also an example of geometric efficiency, albeit three-<a href="/Dimension" title="Dimension">dimensional</a> and little-noticed.  The ends are trihedral (i.e., composed of three planes) sections of <a href="/Rhombic_dodecahedron" title="Rhombic dodecahedron">rhombic dodecahedra</a>, with the <a href="/Dihedral_angle" title="Dihedral angle">dihedral angles</a> of all adjacent surfaces measuring 120°, the angle that minimizes <a href="/Surface_area" title="Surface area">surface area</a> for a given volume.  (The angle formed by the edges at the pyramidal apex, known as the <a href="/Tetrahedral_angle" title="Tetrahedral angle">tetrahedral angle</a>, is approximately 109° 28&#39; 16&#34; ({{nowrap|{{=}} arccos(−1/3)}}).)</p>

</a>&#60;br&#62;The three-dimensional geometry of a honeycomb cell&#60;/div&#62;</p>
<p>The shape of the cells is such that two opposing honeycomb layers nest into each other, with each facet of the closed ends being shared by opposing cells.

</a>&#60;br&#62;Opposing layers of honeycomb cells fit together&#60;/div&#62;</p>
<p>Individual cells do not show this geometric perfection: in a regular comb, deviations of a few <a href="/Percent" title="Percent">percent</a> from the &#34;perfect&#34; hexagonal shape occur. In transition zones between the larger cells of drone comb and the smaller cells of worker comb, or when the bees encounter obstacles, the shapes are often distorted.  Cells are also angled up about 13° from horizontal to prevent honey from dripping out.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite book|last=Frisch|first=Karl von|title=Animal Architecture|year=1974|publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich|location=New York}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>

<p>In 1965, <a href="/L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3_Fejes_T%C3%B3th" title="László Fejes Tóth">László Fejes Tóth</a> discovered the trihedral pyramidal shape (which is composed of three <a href="/Rhombus" title="Rhombus">rhombi</a>) used by the honeybee is not the theoretically optimal three-dimensional geometry.  A cell end composed of two hexagons and two smaller rhombuses would actually be .035% (or about one part per 2850) more efficient. This difference is too minute to measure on an actual honeycomb, and irrelevant to the hive economy in terms of efficient use of wax, considering wild comb varies considerably from any mathematical notion of &#34;ideal&#34; geometry.&#60;ref&#62;
