<p>In many European countries, there are various traditions surrounding the use of <b>bread</b> during the <a href="/Easter" title="Easter">Easter</a> holiday. Traditionally the practice of eating Easter bread or sweetened &#34;communion&#34; bread traces its origin back to Byzantium and the Orthodox Christian church. The recipe for sweetened or &#34;honey-leavened&#34; bread may date back as far as the Homeric Greek period based on anecdotal evidence from classical texts that mention this type of special food. It is also widely known that sweetened bread desserts similar to <a href="/Panettone" title="Panettone">panettone</a>, were a Roman favorite.</p>

<p>In <a href="/Sardinia" title="Sardinia">Sardinia, Italy</a>, bread is a part of a wide social context. It is the most important food in Sardinia, as well as all over Italy and the <a href="/Mediterranean" title="Mediterranean">Mediterranean</a>. &#34;Bread is a nexus of economic, political, aesthetic, social, symbolic, and health concerns&#34;.&#60;ref&#62;Counihan, Carole. The Anthropology of Food and Body: Gender, Meaning, and Power. New York: Routledge, 1999 p.29&#60;/ref&#62; Bread is symbolic for life. A peasant proverb mentions, &#34;Chie hat pane mai non morit&#38;nbsp;— one who has bread never dies&#34;.&#60;ref&#62;Counihan, Carole. The Anthropology of Food and Body: Gender, Meaning, and Power. New York: Routledge, 1999 p.29&#60;/ref&#62; The Easter holiday is one where bread brings itself into the symbolic realm. Bread is significant for religious purposes. Luisa Fois described bread in her life after she was married and for the Easter holiday. The bread was made into a cross to represent the crucifixion of <a href="/Jesus_Christ" title="Jesus Christ">Jesus Christ</a>. Since they were married, they needed to eat it together. They would share their lives now,  and they must share their &#34;cross&#34; together (their life&#39;s burden) as well. &#34;Bread was a product of their union, and its shared consumption reaffirmed their interdependence&#34;.&#60;ref&#62;Counihan, Carole. The Anthropology of Food and Body: Gender, Meaning, and Power. New York: Routledge, 1999 p.30&#60;/ref&#62; From this we gather that bread also displays a message, rather than being an item purely for consumption and nutritional purposes. Two kinds of Easter bread are described in Counihans article. One contained two points, and an egg covered with a cross. &#34;The egg and the points that recall birds in flight speak of fertility, sexuality, and procreation&#38;nbsp;— basic themes in Easter and its pagan precursors&#34;.&#60;ref&#62;Counihan, Carole. The Anthropology of Food and Body: Gender, Meaning, and Power. New York: Routledge, 1999 p.41&#60;/ref&#62; The second bread was designed to have no overall shape, but was rather baked to encircle an egg, with the initials <i>BP</i> put on it. The initials <i>BP</i> stand for <i>buona Pasqua</i> or &#34;happy Easter&#34;. &#34;Letters rather than forms express meaning. Letters are symbolic of civilization and ... meaning&#34;.&#60;ref&#62;Counihan, Carole. The Anthropology of Food and Body: Gender, Meaning, and Power. New York: Routledge, 1999 p.41&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
