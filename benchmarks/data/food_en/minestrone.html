<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>
<p>Some of the earliest origins of minestrone soup pre-date the expansion of the Latin tribes of Rome into what became the Roman Republic and later Roman Empire, when the local diet was &#34;vegetarian by necessity&#34; and consisted mostly of vegetables, such as <a href="/Onion" title="Onion">onions</a>, <a href="/Lentils" title="Lentils">lentils</a>, <a href="/Cabbage#History" title="Cabbage">cabbage</a>, <a href="/Garlic#Culinary_uses" title="Garlic">garlic</a>, <a href="/Vicia_faba" title="Vicia faba">broad beans</a>, <a href="/Edible_mushroom#History_of_mushroom_use" title="Edible mushroom">mushrooms</a>, <a href="/Carrot" title="Carrot">carrots</a>, <a href="/Asparagus" title="Asparagus">asparagus</a>, and <a href="/Turnip#Origin" title="Turnip">turnips</a>.&#60;ref name=MagnaRoma&#62;{{cite book|last=Mattia|first=Francesca di, and Zucchelli, Federico|title=Magna Roma, cibi e bevande di Roma antica|year=2003|publisher=Scipioni|pages=9–16}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>During this time, the main dish of a meal would have been <i>pulte</i>, a simple but filling porridge of <a href="/Spelt" title="Spelt">spelt</a> flour cooked in salt water, to which whatever vegetables that were available would have been added.&#60;ref name=MagnaRoma/&#62;</p>
<p>It was not until the 2nd century B.C., when Rome had conquered Italy and monopolized the commercial and road networks, that a huge diversity of products flooded the capital and began to change their diet, and by association, the diet of Italy&#60;ref name=MagnaRoma/&#62; most notably with the more frequent inclusion of meats, including as a stock for soups.</p>
<p>Spelt flour was also removed from soups, as bread had been introduced into the Roman diet by the Greeks, and <i>pulte</i> became a meal largely for the poor.&#60;ref name=&#34;uchicago1&#34;&#62;<a class="external free" href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Apicius/5*.html&#60;/ref&#38;gt" rel="nofollow">http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Apicius/5*.html&#60;/ref&#38;gt</a>;</p>
<p>The ancient Romans recognized the health benefits of a simple or &#34;frugal&#34; diet (from the Latin <i>fruges</i>, the common name given to cereals, vegetables and legumes) and thick vegetable soups and vegetables remained a staple.&#60;ref name=MagnaRoma/&#62;</p>
<p>Marcus <a href="/Apicius" title="Apicius">Apicius</a>&#39;s ancient cookbook <i>De Re Coquinaria</i> described <i>polus</i>, a Roman soup dating back to 30 AD made up of <a href="/Farro" title="Farro">farro</a>, chickpeas, and <a href="/Fava" title="Fava">fava</a> beans, with onions, garlic, lard, and greens thrown in.&#60;ref name=Wasserman&#62;{{cite book|last=Wasserman-Miller|first=Norma|title=Soups of Italy: Cooking over 130 Soups the Italian Way|year=1998|publisher=William Morrow|location=New York|isbn=0688150314|edition=1st}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>As eating habits and ingredients changed in Italy, so did minestrone. Apicius updates the <i>pultes</i> and <i>pulticulae</i> with fancy trimmings such as cooked brains and wine.&#60;ref name=&#34;uchicago1&#34;/&#62;</p>
<p>The introduction of <a href="/Tomato" title="Tomato">tomatoes</a> and <a href="/Potato" title="Potato">potatoes</a> from the Americas in the mid-16th century changed the soup by making available two ingredients which have since become staples.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}</p>
<p>The tradition of not losing rural roots continues today, and minestrone is now known in Italy as belonging to the style of cooking called &#34;cucina povera&#34; (literally &#34;poor kitchen&#34;) meaning dishes that have rustic, rural roots, as opposed to &#34;cucina nobile&#34; or the cooking style of the aristocracy and nobles.&#60;ref name=Werle&#62;{{cite book|last=Werle|first=Loukie|title=Italian Country Cooking: the Secrets of Cucina Povera|year=2008|publisher=Metro Books|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4351-0126-5}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>Like many Italian dishes, minestrone was probably originally not a dish made for its own sake. In other words, one did not gather the ingredients of minestrone with the intention of making minestrone. The ingredients were pooled from ingredients for other dishes, often <a href="/Side_dish" title="Side dish">side dishes</a> or <i>contorni</i> plus whatever was left over, rather like the <i>pulte</i>.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}</p>
<p>There are two schools of thought on when the recipe for minestrone became more formalized. One argues that in the 17th and 18th centuries minestrone emerged as a soup using exclusively fresh vegetables and was made for its own sake (meaning it no longer relied on left-overs), while the other school of thought argues that the dish had always been prepared exclusively with fresh vegetables for its own sake since the pre-Roman <i>pulte</i>, but the name minestrone lost its meaning of being made with left-overs.{{citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for this paragraph|date=November 2012}}</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Etymology">Etymology</span></h2>
<p>The word minestrone, meaning a thick vegetable soup, is attested in English from 1871.  It is from Italian <i>minestrone</i>, the <a href="/Augmentative" title="Augmentative">augmentative</a> form of <i>minestra</i>, &#34;soup,&#34; or more literally, &#34;that which is served,&#34; from <i>minestrare,</i> &#34;to serve.&#34;&#60;ref name=etymonline&#62;{{cite web|last=Harper|first=Douglas|title=Online Etymology Dictionary: Minestrone|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&#38;search=minestrone&#38;searchmode=none" rel="nofollow">http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&#38;search=minestrone&#38;searchmode=none</a>|accessdate=17 November 2012}}&#60;/ref&#62;&#60;ref name=m-w&#62;{{cite web|title=minestrone|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/minestrone?show=0&#38;t=1353179675" rel="nofollow">http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/minestrone?show=0&#38;t=1353179675</a>|publisher=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=17 November 2012|year=2012}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Modern_usage">Modern usage</span></h2>
<p>Because of its unique origins and the absence of a fixed <a href="/Recipe" title="Recipe">recipe</a>, minestrone varies widely across Italy depending on traditional cooking times, ingredients, and <a href="/Season" title="Season">season</a>. Minestrone ranges from a thick and dense texture with very boiled-down vegetables, to a more brothy soup with large quantities of diced and lightly cooked <a href="/Vegetable" title="Vegetable">vegetables</a>; it may also include <a href="/Meat" title="Meat">meats</a>.</p>
<p>In modern Italian there are three words corresponding to the English word &#39;soup&#39;: <i>zuppa</i>, which is used in the sense of <a href="/Tomato_soup" title="Tomato soup">tomato soup</a>, or <a href="/Fish_soup" title="Fish soup">fish soup</a>; <i>minestra</i>, which is used in the sense of a more substantial soup such as a vegetable soup, and also for &#39;dry&#39; soups, namely pasta dishes; and <i>minestrone</i>, which means a very substantial or large soup or <a href="/Stew" title="Stew">stew</a>, though the meaning has now come to be associated with this particular dish.</p>
