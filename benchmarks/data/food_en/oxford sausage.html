<p><b>Oxford sausages</b> are a distinctive variety of <a href="/Pork" title="Pork">pork</a> and <a href="/Veal" title="Veal">veal</a> <a href="/Sausage" title="Sausage">sausage</a> commonly associated with, and thought to have been developed in, the <a href="/England" title="England">English</a> city of <a href="/Oxford" title="Oxford">Oxford</a>. Traditionally, Oxford sausages are noted for the addition of veal, in contrast to many traditional British sausages which contain only pork, and their high level of <a href="/Spice" title="Spice">spice</a> seasoning. References to the &#34;Oxford&#34; style of sausage date back to at least the early 18th century, but it was more widely popularised owing to inclusion in <i><a href="/Mrs_Beeton&#39;s_Book_of_Household_Management" title="Mrs Beeton&#39;s Book of Household Management">Mrs Beeton&#39;s Book of Household Management</a></i>, first published in 1861.&#60;ref name=Beeton&#62;{{cite book|last= Beeton |first= Isabella |authorlink= Mrs Beeton |title= Mrs Beeton&#39;s Book of Household Management |year= 1861 |publisher= S.O.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>
<p>The first published reference to a sausage that closely resembles the modern Oxford sausage is by <a href="/John_Nott_(cook)" title="John Nott (cook)">John Nott</a> in his book <i>The Cook&#39;s and Confectioner&#39;s Dictionary: Or, the Accomplish&#39;d Housewife&#39;s Companion</i>,&#60;ref name=oxtimes&#62;{{cite news|title= Have You the Sauce to Write Us a Recipe? |work= The Oxford Times |date= 25 January 2005 }}&#60;/ref&#62; published in <a href="/London" title="London">London</a> in 1723.&#60;ref name=Nott&#62;{{cite book|last= Nott |first= John |title= The Cook&#39;s and Confectioner&#39;s Dictionary: Or, the Accomplish&#39;d Housewife&#39;s Companion |year= 1723 }}&#60;/ref&#62; In the text Nott, cook to the <a href="/Charles_Powlett%2C_3rd_Duke_of_Bolton" title="Charles Powlett, 3rd Duke of Bolton">Duke of Bolton</a>, refers to the sausages as &#34;Oxford Skates&#34; (or &#34;Kates&#34;, as listed in the index). Whether this was a common local recipe or one created by Nott is unclear. By the late 18th century the spice-rich nature of the Oxford sausage had entered popular consciousness to such an extent that <a href="/Thomas_Warton" title="Thomas Warton">Thomas Warton</a> used <i>The Oxford Sausage</i> as the title for his compilation of &#34;highly spiced&#34; political and satirical college verse,&#60;ref&#62;{{cite book|last= Warton |first= Thomas |authorlink= Thomas Warton |title= The Oxford Sausage: Or, Select Political Pieces, Written by the most Celebrated Wits of the University of Oxford |year= 1764 |publisher= J. Fletcher and Co. |location= <a href="/London" title="London">London</a> }}&#60;/ref&#62; first published in 1764 and republished a number of times in the following 50 years. A number of variations on the recipe were published over the years, until <a href="/Mrs_Beeton" title="Mrs Beeton">Isabella Beeton</a> selected the Oxford style as her exemplar for a typical pork sausage in her 1861 <i>Book of Household Management</i>.&#60;ref name=Beeton /&#62; With the popularity of this book the recipe reached a much wider audience, and Oxford sausage was for a time available as a canned, processed product. However, with the rise of mass-production, supermarkets and global distribution, the Oxford sausage fell out of favour. The modern rise of local food movements have resulted in the Oxford sausage being revived, albeit in a revised form.&#60;ref name=bang&#62;{{cite web|title= The Rise of the Oxford Sausage |url= <a class="external free" href="http://www.thebigbangrestaurants.co.uk/Oxford/oxsaus.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.thebigbangrestaurants.co.uk/Oxford/oxsaus.htm</a> |work= The Big Bang |accessdate= 2009-10-28 }}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>

<p>As with most regional foodstuffs, different recipes for Oxford sausages vary in many aspects, but all follow a similar ingredient list. The modern Oxford sausage is considered, typically, to consist of a mixture of pork and veal, seasoned with <a href="/Lemon" title="Lemon">lemon</a> and herbs.&#60;ref name=bsw&#62;{{cite web|title= Sausage Facts and Stats |url= <a class="external free" href="http://www.britishsausageweek.com/documents/FASTFACTSONSAUSAGES.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.britishsausageweek.com/documents/FASTFACTSONSAUSAGES.pdf</a> |work= British Sausage Week |accessdate= 2009-10-28 }}&#60;/ref&#62; Nott&#39;s 1723 recipe calls for pork <i>or</i> veal, seasoned with <a href="/Salt" title="Salt">salt</a>, <a href="/Black_pepper" title="Black pepper">pepper</a>, <a href="/Clove" title="Clove">clove</a>, <a href="/Mace_(spice)" title="Mace (spice)">mace</a> and <a href="/Salvia_officinalis" title="Salvia officinalis">sage</a>.&#60;ref name=Nott /&#62;  The spice content also appears in many other late 18th and early 19th century recipes, with mace or nutmeg (derived from the same seed) being a consistent ingredient. Mrs. Beeton&#39;s recipe broadly followed the same formula, excepting that a 50:50 mixture of pork and veal is specified, with the addition of a similar quantity of beef <a href="/Suet" title="Suet">suet</a>.&#60;ref name=Beeton /&#62; Beeton also includes the addition of lemon, although she was not the first to do so. While many modern producers retain a traditional recipe, owing to animal welfare concerns&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|title= Food Legends of the United Kingdom: Oxford Sausage |url= <a class="external free" href="http://www.information-britain.co.uk/food/foodlegends/Oxford%20Sausage/" rel="nofollow">http://www.information-britain.co.uk/food/foodlegends/Oxford%20Sausage/</a> |work= Information Britain |accessdate= 2009-10-28 }}&#60;/ref&#62; some have replaced the veal content with <a href="/Lamb_and_mutton" title="Lamb and mutton">lamb</a>&#60;ref&#62;{{cite episode |title= 10.

<p>As first produced, the Oxford sausage did not have a skin or other casing, but was hand-formed and floured before frying.&#60;ref name=Nott /&#62; However, modern forms are commonly made in a conventional, linked <i>banger</i> style, with natural pork or sheep casings. Beeton mentions both methods.&#60;ref name=Beeton /&#62;</p>
