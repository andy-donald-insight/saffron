Newer cultivars, such as <a href="/Elliot_Pecan" title="Elliot Pecan">&#39;Elliot&#39;</a>, are increasing in popularity due to their resistance to certain regional climate-related diseases.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite journal |last=Conner |first=Patrick |last2=Sparks |first2=Darrell |date= |title=&#39;Elliott&#39; Pecan |url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.caes.uga.edu/commodities/fruits/pecanbreeding/papers/documents/ElliotPaper.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.caes.uga.edu/commodities/fruits/pecanbreeding/papers/documents/ElliotPaper.pdf</a> |journal= |publisher=Department of Horticulture, University of Georgia |volume= |issue= |pages= |doi= |access-date=May 31, 2015}}&#60;/ref&#62;  The long cycle time for pecan trees plus financial considerations dictate that new varieties go through an extensive vetting process before being widely planted. Numerous examples of varieties produce well in Texas, but fail in the Southeastern U.S. due to increased disease pressure. Selection programs are ongoing at the state level, with Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Kansas, Florida, Missouri and others having trial plantings.</p>
<p>Varieties that are adapted from the southern tier of states up through some parts of Iowa and even into southern Canada are available from nurseries. Production potential drops significantly when planted further north than Tennessee. Most breeding efforts for northern-adapted varieties have not been on a large enough scale to significantly affect production. Varieties that are available and adapted (e.g., &#39;Major&#39;, &#39;Martzahn&#39;, &#39;Witte&#39;, &#39;Greenriver&#39;, and &#39;Posey&#39;) in <a href="/Hardiness_zone" title="Hardiness zone">zones 6</a> and farther north are almost entirely selections from wild stands.

<p>The pecan, <i>Carya illinoinensis</i>, is a member of the <a href="/Juglandaceae" title="Juglandaceae">Juglandaceae</a> family. Juglandaceae are represented worldwide by between seven and 10 extant genera and more than 60 species. Most of these species are concentrated in the Northern Hemisphere of the New World, but can be found on every continent except for Antarctica. The first fossil examples of the family appear during the <a href="/Cretaceous" title="Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a>. Differentiation between the subfamilies of Engelhardioideae and Juglandioideae occurred during the early <a href="/Paleogene" title="Paleogene">Paleogene</a>, about 64 million years ago. Extant examples of Engelharioideae are generally tropical and evergreen, while those of Juglandioideae are deciduous and found in more temperate zones. The second major step in the development of the pecan was a change from wind-dispersed fruits to animal dispersion. This dispersal strategy coincides with the development of a husk around the fruit and a drastic change in the relative concentrations of fatty acids. The ratio of oleic to linoleic acids are inverted between wind- and animal-dispersed seeds.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite journal|jstor=2440634 |author=Donald E. Stone|title=New World Juglandaceae. II.

<p>Before European settlement, pecans were widely consumed and traded by Native Americans. As a food source, pecans are a natural choice for preagricultural society. They can provide two to five times more calories per unit weight than wild game, and require no preparation. As a wild forage, the fruit of the previous growing season is commonly still edible when found on the ground. Hollow tree trunks, found in abundance in pecan stands, offer ideal storage of pecans by humans and squirrels alike.&#60;ref name=&#34;Grant D. Hall&#34; /&#62;</p>
<p>Pecans first became known to Europeans in the 16th century. The first Europeans to come into contact with pecans were Spanish explorers in what is now Mexico, Texas, and Louisiana. These Spanish explorers called the pecan, &#34;nuez de la arruga&#34;, which roughly translates to, &#34;wrinkle nut&#34; They were called this for their resemblance to wrinkles. The genus <i>Carya</i> does not exist in the Old World. Because of their familiarity with the genus <i><a href="/Juglans" title="Juglans">Juglans</a></i>, these early explorers referred to the nuts as <i>nogales</i> and <i>nueces</i>, the Spanish terms for &#34;walnut trees&#34; and &#34;fruit of the walnut.&#34; They noted the particularly thin shell and acorn-like shape of the fruit, indicating they were indeed referring to pecans.&#60;ref name=&#34;Grant D. Hall&#34; /&#62; The Spaniards took the pecan into <a href="/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a>, <a href="/Asia" title="Asia">Asia</a>, and <a href="/Africa" title="Africa">Africa</a> beginning in the 16th century. In 1792, <a href="/William_Bartram" title="William Bartram">William Bartram</a> reported in his botanical book, <i>Travels</i>, a nut tree, <i>Juglans exalata</i> that some botanists today argue was the American pecan tree, but others argue was hickory, <i>Carya ovata</i>. Pecan trees are native to the United States, and writing about the pecan tree goes back to the nation&#39;s founders. <a href="/Thomas_Jefferson" title="Thomas Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a> planted pecan trees, <i>Carya illinoinensis</i> (Illinois nuts), in his nut orchard at his home, Monticello, in Virginia. <a href="/George_Washington" title="George Washington">George Washington</a> reported in his journal that Thomas Jefferson gave him &#34;Illinois nuts&#34;, pecans, which <a href="/George_Washington" title="George Washington">George Washington</a> then grew at <a href="/Mount_Vernon" title="Mount Vernon">Mount Vernon</a>, his Virginia home.</p>

<p>In 1906, Texas Governor <a href="/James_Stephen_Hogg" title="James Stephen Hogg">James Stephen Hogg</a> asked that a pecan tree be planted at his grave instead of a traditional headstone, requesting that the seeds be distributed throughout the state to make Texas a &#34;Land of Trees&#34;.&#60;ref name=&#34;Texas Pecan Growers Association&#34; /&#62; His wish was carried out and this brought more attention to pecan trees. In 1919, the 36th Texas Legislature made the pecan tree the <a href="/List_of_U.S._state_trees" title="List of U.S. state trees">state tree</a> of <a href="/Texas" title="Texas">Texas</a> where the town of <a href="/San_Saba%2C_Texas" title="San Saba, Texas">San Saba</a> claims to be &#34;The Pecan Capital of the World&#34;.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.sansabatexas.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.sansabatexas.com</a>|title=Town website for San Saba, Texas|publisher=Town of San Saba Texas}}&#60;/ref&#62; Several other American towns and regions host annual events celebrating the pecan harvest.</p>
