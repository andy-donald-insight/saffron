<p><b>Moimoi</b> or <b>Moyi-Moyi</b> is a <a href="/Nigeria" title="Nigeria">Nigerian</a> <a href="/Steaming" title="Steaming">steamed</a> bean <a href="/Pudding" title="Pudding">pudding</a> made from a mixture of washed and peeled <a href="/Black-eyed_pea" title="Black-eyed pea">black-eyed peas</a>, <a href="/Onion" title="Onion">onions</a> and fresh ground peppers (usually a combination of <a href="/Bell_peppers" title="Bell peppers">bell peppers</a> and <a href="/Chili_pepper" title="Chili pepper">chili</a> or <a href="/Scotch_bonnet_(pepper)" title="Scotch bonnet (pepper)">scotch bonnet</a>). It is a protein-rich food that is a staple in Nigeria. Some adaptations also put apples in MoiMoi. It originated from South-West Nigeria.</p>
<p>MoiMoi is prepared by first soaking the beans in cold water until they are soft enough to remove the fine outer covering or peel.  Then they are ground or blended (using a <a href="/Blender" title="Blender">blender</a>) until a fine paste is achieved.  <a href="/Salt" title="Salt">Salt</a>, <a href="/Bouillon_cube" title="Bouillon cube">bouillon cube</a>, dried <a href="/Crayfish" title="Crayfish">crayfish</a>, <a href="/Vegetable_oil" title="Vegetable oil">vegetable oil</a> (or any edible oil such as palm oil) and other seasonings are added to taste.  Some add <a href="/Sardines" title="Sardines">sardines</a>, <a href="/Corned_beef" title="Corned beef">corned beef</a>, sliced <a href="/Boiled_egg" title="Boiled egg">boiled eggs</a>, or a combination of these and other &#39;garnishes&#39; to liven up MoiMoi.  Such is referred to as having &#39;x&#39; number of lives, &#39;x&#39; representing the number of garnishes added.  The most touted is &#34;MoiMoi elemi meje&#34;, which translates to Moi Moi with 7 lives.</p>
<p>Moi Moi usually comes in a slanted pyramid shape or a cylindrical shape, owing to the mold it is poured into prior to cooking.  The pyramid shape comes from the traditional broad &#34;ewe eran&#34; (<i><a href="/Thaumatococcus_daniellii" title="Thaumatococcus daniellii">Thaumatococcus daniellii</a></i>) or <a href="/Banana_leaf" title="Banana leaf">banana leaves</a> fashioned into a cone in one&#39;s palm, then the seasoned and garnished liquid is poured into the leaves, which is then folded.</p>
<p>The cylindrical shapes come from empty cans of milk or tomato sauce used in preparation of other dishes.  Once placed in its mold, it is placed in a large pot about a tenth filled with water.  The water is the source of steam that cooks the MoiMoi.  MoiMoi is eaten alone or with bread as a snack, with rice as a meal or with <a href="/Ogi_(cereal_ferment)" title="Ogi (cereal ferment)">ogi</a> for breakfast or supper. it can also be taken with <a href="/Garri" title="Garri">garri</a> in the afternoon.</p>
