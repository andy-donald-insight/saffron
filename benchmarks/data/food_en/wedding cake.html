<p>Wedding cakes have been present at wedding ceremonies for centuries. They were not always the focus of the event and often came in different forms, like pies or bread. There has always been a lot of symbolism associated with the wedding cake. The earliest known sweet wedding cake is known as a <a href="/Banbury_cake" title="Banbury cake">Banbury cake</a>, which became popular in 1655.&#60;ref&#62;Charlsey, Simon. (1988).The wedding cake:history and meanings, Tayler&#38;Fansis,Ltd, 99(2), 232-41.&#60;/ref&#62; During the Roman era unsweetened barley bread was used as the wedding food and the groom would break the piece of bread in half over the brides head symbolizing “breaking of the bride’s virginal state and the subsequent dominance of the groom over her.&#34;&#60;ref name=&#34;hudsonvalleyweddings.com&#34;/&#62; One of the most obvious symbolic traditions is the cake’s white color to symbolize virginity and purity. The white color has been attached to wedding ceremonies since the <a href="/Victorian_era" title="Victorian era">Victorian era</a> when <a href="/Queen_Victoria" title="Queen Victoria">Queen Victoria</a> chose to wear a <a href="/White_wedding" title="White wedding">white wedding</a> dress at her wedding to <a href="/Albert%2C_Prince_Consort" title="Albert, Prince Consort">Prince Albert</a> in 1840. Queen Victoria accentuated an existing symbol, the color white is frequently associated with virginity and purity. The wedding cake was originally known as the brides cake therefore the color white became common because the cake needed to reflect the bride.&#60;ref name=&#34;hudsonvalleyweddings.com&#34;/&#62;</p>
<p>The cutting of the cake is a task full of symbolism. The cake was originally intended to be distributed among the guests by only the bride because consuming the cake would ensure fertility.&#60;ref name=&#34;hudsonvalleyweddings.com&#34;/&#62; As weddings grew and the number of guests increased this task became a joint venture, the groom needed to help cut the growing cake and distribute it among their guests. Layers of cakes began to pile up and the icing would need to support the weight of the cake making is very difficult for one person to cut. The groom would assist the bride in this process. Once this tradition began the bride and groom would share a piece of cake before distributing it to the guests to symbolize their union and their promise to forever provide for each other.&#60;ref name=&#34;hudsonvalleyweddings.com&#34;/&#62;</p>

<p>There are also myths that most <a href="/Bridesmaids" title="Bridesmaids">bridesmaids</a> have on dreaming their future husbands.

<p>Wedding cakes come in several types, such as traditional wedding cakes, wedding cakes based on flavor, smaller cakes or individual cakes, frosted cakes, and cupcakes. Traditional wedding cakes are white, including decoration and icing varieties such as buttercream, almond. etc.  Wedding cakes based on flavor include chocolate, vanilla, or strawberry.  Smaller cakes or individual cakes can be more efficient in terms price.  Frosted cakes are popular due to the large amount of cream.</p>
<p>In modern society, the most popular wedding cake is called “Traditional stack cake.&#34; This consists of layers of tiers– which can be a different flavors– positioned directly on top of the last”.&#60;ref&#62;Naomi &#38; Bruce (2009). Wedding cake types. Retrieved from: www.angelcakecompany.co.uk/wedding-cake-types.php.&#60;/ref&#62; The traditional stack wedding cake is similar to the tiered cake.  Often they are filled with flowers or columns to add visual impact and height.  Separators can include jewels, shells, flowers and the like or can be completely separated by using traditional chrome stands.</p>
<p>White cake is currently the most traditional wedding cake flavor, but different flavors of filling can be added between layers. Chocolate, carrot, Italian Rum and Italian Cream are also popular choices.  Frosting can be a classic smooth surface or combined with drizzle, swirls, or chips.&#60;ref&#62;Mayntz, M. (2010)Chocolate Wedding Cakes. Retrieved from: weddings.lovetoknow.com/wiki/Chocolate_Wedding_Cakes&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p><a href="/Fondant_icing" title="Fondant icing">fondant</a> is a creative form of frosting style that is rolled out and draped over tiers.  Its smooth, firm sugar icing is often embellished with appliqués, gum-paste flowers, or royal-icing details. Fondant can be cut into designs, formed into shapes, flavored or tinted. Poured fondant is used to glaze petits fours and other detailed confections.  Such fondant gives a glossy finish and a sweet sugary taste.</p>
<p>Royal icing is made with sugar and egg white or meringue powder. It hardens to a firm finish that can be piped or thinned for “flood work.”  It hardens fast and is ideal for making detailed shapes ahead of time. It can also be piped directly onto cake tiers and works beautifully for delicate work.&#60;ref name=&#34;Stewart, M. 2007&#34;/&#62;</p>
<p>In some areas, particularly the American South, two cakes are presented at weddings.  The more traditional tiered cake is the Bride&#39;s Cake, and a second flavor choice is called the &#34;Groom&#39;s Cake.&#34;  This tradition was brought over from England by early American colonists, who considered the white-iced &#34;Bride&#39;s Cake&#34; too light for masculinity.  The groom&#39;s cake was usually a dark, liquor-soaked fruitcake, particularly in Virginia.  Today Groom&#39;s Cakes are usually chocolate, although the groom often choose another of his favorite flavors.  The groom&#39;s cake is usually decorated or shaped as something significant to him, such as a hobby item, sports team or symbol of his occupation.  The movie &#34;Steel Magnolias&#34; features a red velvet groom&#39;s cake in the shape of a giant armadillo.  The Groom&#39;s Cake is served at the reception as a second flavor choice for the guests, although in some regions it is served at the rehearsal dinner.</p>
