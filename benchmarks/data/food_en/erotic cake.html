An <b>erotic cake</b> is a <a href="/Cake" title="Cake">cake</a> which, while typically using the ingredients of other dessert cakes, is frosted and shaped to represent <a href="/Human_sexuality" title="Human sexuality">sexual</a> parts, acts and organs. Often sexually-related greetings and expressions are written on the surface with icing. The cakes are most often baked and prepared by a retailer who specializes in the style, and are presented to an individual during a festivity limited to adults, such as a <a href="/Bachelor_party" title="Bachelor party">bachelor party</a> or a <a href="/Party#Birthday_party" title="Party">birthday party</a>.&#60;ref name=&#34;Guide-1&#34;&#62;Katy Calcott, <a class="external text" href="http://books.google.ca/books?id=6LDueuaqsl0C&#38;pg=PA25&#38;dq=erotic+cakes&#38;hl=en&#38;sa=X&#38;ei=kDvGT4fuH4Hk6QG6uPnIBg&#38;ved=0CEoQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&#38;q=erotic%20cakes&#38;f=false" rel="nofollow"><i>The Food Lover&#39;s Guide to Seattle</i>.</a> Sasquatch Books.&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
