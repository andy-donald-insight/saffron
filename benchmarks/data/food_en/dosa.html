<b><i>The Thick of It</i></b> is a <a href="/British_comedy" title="British comedy">British comedy</a> television series that <a href="/Satire" title="Satire">satirises</a> the inner workings of modern <a href="/Her_Majesty&#39;s_Government" title="Her Majesty&#39;s Government">British government</a>. It was first broadcast for two short series on <a href="/BBC_Four" title="BBC Four">BBC Four</a> in 2005, initially with a small cast focusing on a government minister, his advisers and their party&#39;s spin-doctor. The cast was significantly expanded for two hour-long specials to coincide with Christmas and <a href="/Gordon_Brown" title="Gordon Brown">Gordon Brown</a>&#39;s appointment as <a href="/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="Prime Minister of the United Kingdom">prime minister</a> in 2007, which saw new characters forming the opposition party added to the cast. These characters continued when the show switched channels to <a href="/BBC_Two" title="BBC Two">BBC Two</a> for its third series in 2009. A fourth series about a coalition government was broadcast in 2012, with the last episode transmitted on 27 October 2012. In a 2012 interview, series creator <a href="/Armando_Iannucci" title="Armando Iannucci">Armando Iannucci</a> said the fourth series of the programme would probably be its last.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|last=Mellor |first=Louisa |url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.denofgeek.com/tv/the-thick-of-it/23116/the-thick-of-it-series-4-to-be-its-last" rel="nofollow">http://www.denofgeek.com/tv/the-thick-of-it/23116/the-thick-of-it-series-4-to-be-its-last</a> |title=The Thick Of It series 4 to be its last |publisher=Den of Geek |date=2012-10-19 |accessdate=2013-07-10}}&#60;/ref&#62;&#60;ref&#62;{{Cite news|last=Urquhart |first=Conal |url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/sep/01/armando-iannucci-social-media" rel="nofollow">http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/sep/01/armando-iannucci-social-media</a> |title=Armando Iannucci turns satirical eye on Silicon Valley |work=The Guardian |date=1 September 2012 |accessdate=1 September 2012 | location=London}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Plot">Plot</span></h2>
<p>The action centres on the fictional Department of Social Affairs and Citizenship (&#34;DoSAC&#34; – previously the Department of Social Affairs, or &#34;DSA&#34;, prior to the reshuffle of episode five), which supposedly came out of the prime minister&#39;s passing enthusiasm for &#34;joined-up government&#34;. Thus it acts as a &#34;super department&#34; overseeing many others, which enables different political themes to be dealt with in the programme, similar to the Department of Administrative Affairs in <i><a href="/Yes_Minister" title="Yes Minister">Yes Minister</a></i>.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2005/12_december/08/thick.shtml" rel="nofollow">BBC Press Release</a>. Retrieved 18 January 2007.&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>Hugh Abbot, played by <a href="/Chris_Langham" title="Chris Langham">Chris Langham</a>, is a blundering minister heading the department, who is continually trying to do his job under the watchful eye of Malcolm Tucker (<a href="/Peter_Capaldi" title="Peter Capaldi">Peter Capaldi</a>), <a href="/10_Downing_Street" title="10 Downing Street">Number 10</a>&#39;s highly aggressive and domineering &#34;enforcer&#34;. The programme also features <a href="/James_Smith_(actor)" title="James Smith (actor)">James Smith</a> as senior <a href="/Special_advisers_in_the_United_Kingdom" title="Special advisers in the United Kingdom">special adviser</a> Glenn Cullen, <a href="/Chris_Addison" title="Chris Addison">Chris Addison</a> as junior policy adviser Ollie Reeder, and <a href="/Joanna_Scanlan" title="Joanna Scanlan">Joanna Scanlan</a> as civil service press secretary Terri Coverley.</p>
<p>The series was revamped for the third series with Hugh Abbot being replaced as head of DoSAC by Nicola Murray (<a href="/Rebecca_Front" title="Rebecca Front">Rebecca Front</a>), who arrives without her own staff, so Ollie and Glenn find themselves keeping their jobs.</p>
<p>From series 4, after a general election which results in a coalition government, Peter Mannion MP (<a href="/Roger_Allam" title="Roger Allam">Roger Allam</a>) is new Secretary of State for DoSAC, supported by his team of special advisers, commanded by Number 10&#39;s Director of Communications Stewart Pearson (Vincent Franklin) and thwarted by his new coalition partner, DoSAC&#39;s junior minister Fergus Williams MP (Geoffrey Streatfeild). Nicola Murray MP is now leader of the opposition, and opposition spin doctor Malcolm Tucker is desperate for a return to power.</p>
<p>Even though no mention is made of the words &#34;Labour&#34;, &#34;Conservative&#34; and &#34;Liberal Democrat&#34;, it is strongly implied throughout the four series that this is a dramatised reflection of real-life political parties and events rather than a <a href="/Parallel_universe_(fiction)" title="Parallel universe (fiction)">parallel universe</a>. Each political party is portrayed in equally unflattering terms, each being shown as inept, accident-prone and generally inefficient, and each having their own unique problems. For instance, the ruling party of the first three seasons, to which Abbot and Murray belong, is portrayed as being hampered by its many warring factions and internal strife, which reflects the real-life factionalism and power struggles within the Labour Party both during and after <a href="/Tony_Blair" title="Tony Blair">Tony Blair</a>&#39;s leadership and the rise to power of <a href="/Gordon_Brown" title="Gordon Brown">Gordon Brown</a>&#39;s faction (roughly identified as the &#34;Nutters&#34; in the series), as well as its pragmatic approach to politics. On the other side, the Opposition party to which Mannion belongs is portrayed as suffering from an image problem, being seen as backward, old-fashioned and unprogressive, and having a relatively young, inexperienced leader running a PR overhaul to broaden the party&#39;s appeal - a reference to Conservative Party leader <a href="/David_Cameron" title="David Cameron">David Cameron</a>, whose attention to image in his early years of leadership was often derided both inside and outside his party. Additionally, the smaller coalition party of which Fergus Williams is a member is portrayed as having similar principles to Murray&#39;s party, and is widely accused of having betrayed of its own principles by entering into a coalition with Mannion&#39;s party, referencing similar accusations made against the Liberal Democrats after <a href="/United_Kingdom_coalition_government_(2010%E2%80%93present)" title="United Kingdom coalition government (2010–present)">the 2010 coalition</a> was formed. Most parallels are drawn from personal conversations between characters, rather than actual policies, however - indeed, most of the actual policies that are seen being implemented are quite mundane, and have no political or ideological significance. For instance, there is an underlying bitterness between Dan Miller and Nicola Murray in the fourth season because Murray reportedly won leadership on a &#34;technicality,&#34; despite not having the leadership material that Miller has, a reference to the events of the <a href="/Labour_Party_(UK)_leadership_election%2C_2010" title="Labour Party (UK) leadership election, 2010">2010 Labour leadership election</a>, which saw <a href="/Ed_Miliband" title="Ed Miliband">Ed Miliband</a> become leader over his brother, <a href="/David_Miliband" title="David Miliband">David</a>, which likewise came down to a technicality in the voting procedure. Throughout the series, Mannion&#39;s party is linked by Malcolm and his co-workers to snobbishness, emotional suppression, upper-class institutions such as <a href="/Eton_College" title="Eton College">Eton College</a>. On another occasion, Mannion - who, though fairly moderate compared to others within his party, is nevertheless a member of the &#34;old guard&#34; - complains to Stewart Pearson about the hypocrisy of the <a href="/Leader_of_the_Opposition" title="Leader of the Opposition">Leader of the Opposition</a> and his &#34;Eton clique&#34; who are ostensibly trying to modernise their party by expelling its bigoted and old-fashioned members while routinely texting each other racist jokes in private. Upon being fired, Pearson congratulates himself for ridding his party of toxic elements usually identified with a reactionary credo. In the fourth season, Glenn Cullen is often seen to complain to Terri and Ollie about Fergus&#39;s willingness to throw his lot in with a party whose policies vastly contradicted their own, having left his original party because of disillusionment with their political pragmatism. Perhaps the clearest indication of the real-life basis for the fictional parties and events is a comment by Phil Smith, who belongs to Mannion&#39;s party: &#34;... a lot of good things came out of the 80s: (...) deregulation of the stock exchange, <i><a href="/Conservative_Party_(UK)" title="Conservative Party (UK)">us</a> being in power</i>...&#34;. The mainstream media and general public are commonly portrayed in equally unflattering terms, being portrayed as aggressively hounding politicians and asking awkward, often outrageous questions, or otherwise being discourteous and harsh.</p>

<p>{{Main|List of The Thick of It episodes}}</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Series_1_.282005.29">Series 1 (2005)</span></h3>
<p>In the first batch of three episodes, Hugh Abbot is installed as a new minister following the forced resignation of his predecessor Cliff Lawton. These episodes follow his attempts to make his mark on the department by introducing new policies while following the party line enforced by Malcolm Tucker. Due to a series of complications and mistakes, this leads to the minister coming close to resignation on a number of occasions.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Series_2_.282005.29">Series 2 (2005)</span></h3>
<p>The second batch of episodes takes place before a cabinet reshuffle, and follows the minister&#39;s attempts to keep his job. Ollie Reeder is seconded to number 10 &#34;to phone his girlfriend&#34; Emma Messinger, a member of the <a href="/Official_Opposition_Shadow_Cabinet_(United_Kingdom)" title="Official Opposition Shadow Cabinet (United Kingdom)">shadow</a> defence policy team, where he is under the close eye of enforcer Jamie. Meanwhile, Terri Coverley is on compassionate leave following the death of her father, leaving her role to Robyn Murdoch, a senior press officer. The department also has to contend with the interference of the prime minister&#39;s &#34;blue skies&#34; adviser Julius Nicholson. The minister and the department survive the reshuffle, with the department being rebranded as the &#34;Department of Social Affairs and Citizenship&#34; and moved to a new building. However, the mistakes and compromises continue.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Specials_.282007.29">Specials (2007)</span></h3>
<p>In the two specials, following the Christmas break, Hugh Abbot is in Australia and the department has to &#34;babysit&#34; junior minister for immigration Ben Swain, who is described as a &#34;Nutter&#34; (a term used for supporters of prime-minister-in-waiting Tom Davis).&#60;ref name=&#34;Tom&#34;&#62;The new PM is variously called Davies and Davis in reasonably authoritative sources. A newspaper draft in the second special clearly reads Davis.&#60;/ref&#62; The first special (&#34;Rise of the Nutters&#34;) revolves around a computer problem at Immigration, which is exacerbated by the junior minister appearing in a disastrous <i><a href="/Newsnight" title="Newsnight">Newsnight</a></i> interview. The opposition policy adviser Emma Messinger capitalises on the error by stealing an idea from her boyfriend Ollie Reeder, to send the shadow minister Peter Mannion on a fact-finding mission at an immigration centre. Meanwhile, Tucker is concerned about his position in the government after speculating that the prime minister&#39;s handover to Tom Davis&#60;ref name=&#34;Tom&#34; /&#62; is expected in less than six months. Tucker conspires with Ollie to leak the prime minister&#39;s &#34;legacy programme&#34; (the PM&#39;s plan to move the handling of immigration policy to a non-political executive board) in the hope of stalling his departure, inadvertently leading the PM to resign early. The next episode (&#34;Spinners and Losers&#34;) follows a single night of &#34;spin&#34;, as advisers, junior politicians and enforcers all try to better their position during the transition, but only Malcolm gets anywhere.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Series_3_.282009.29">Series 3 (2009)</span></h3>
<p>In series 3, Hugh Abbot is replaced as minister by Nicola Murray, played by <a href="/Rebecca_Front" title="Rebecca Front">Rebecca Front</a>. She is an unexpected, last-minute choice for the position, and given her inexperience and lack of staff, she is forced to retain Ollie and Glenn as her advisers. The series continues to focus on the general running, or mis-running, of DoSAC, with Murray&#39;s attempts to formulate her &#34;Fourth Sector Pathfinder Initiative&#34; being a running thread throughout the series. With the cloud of the forthcoming general election and tension at <a href="/10_Downing_Street" title="10 Downing Street">10 Downing Street</a> looming, the series also broadens its scope to include episodes set at the annual <a href="/Party_conference" title="Party conference">party conference</a> and <a href="/BBC_Radio_5_Live" title="BBC Radio 5 Live">BBC Radio 5 Live</a>. We also see more of Murray&#39;s opposite number, Peter Mannion, and other members of the opposition first seen in the 2007 specials. The gradual breakdown of Malcolm Tucker and appearance of new threats to his control, in particular Steve Fleming (<a href="/David_Haig" title="David Haig">David Haig</a>), are also major plotlines. The series ends with Fleming forcing Malcolm&#39;s resignation, only to be ousted himself a matter of hours later. Having regained dominance, Malcolm decides to call an election immediately to seize the initiative from his enemies in the opposition and his own party.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Series_4_.282012.29">Series 4 (2012)</span></h3>
<p>In series 4, the government and opposition have switched places following an election during which JB failed to gain a majority and is therefore in <a href="/Coalition_government" title="Coalition government">coalition government</a> with a smaller third party. Peter Mannion has been made the Secretary of State for Social Affairs and Citizenship but has to contend with Fergus Williams, his junior partner in the coalition. Meanwhile, following Tom Davis&#39;s defeat and resignation, Nicola Murray had been elected by her party, apparently on a technicality over Dan Miller, her opponent, as leader of the opposition, although she resigns at the end of episode four and is replaced by her deputy, Miller. A running thread throughout the series is an ongoing &#34;<a href="/Leveson_Inquiry" title="Leveson Inquiry">Leveson</a>-style public inquiry&#34; which takes place in episode six. While the first four episodes each focuses solely on one party (episodes one and three focusing on the Coalition, and episode two and four focusing on the Opposition), each episode thereafter cuts between the parties. The final three episodes of series four show both parties trying to cover their tracks regarding a public health care bill which has led to the public eviction and consequent suicide of Douglas Tickel, a nurse with a history of mental illness. All three main parties have some level of responsibility and have participated in the illegal leaking of documents, in particular Tickel&#39;s medical records, which is the reason for the Goolding Inquiry being launched.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/jul/12/the-thick-of-it-leveson" rel="nofollow">The Thick of It to return with Leveson-style inquiry</a>, Mark Sweeney, 12 July 2012&#60;/ref&#62;</p>

Although it is not a direct spin-off, &#34;Veep&#34; shares a similar tone and style with <i>The Thick of It</i>. In November 2010 it was announced that HBO had ordered a pilot for a new series called <i><a href="/Veep_(TV_series)" title="Veep (TV series)">Veep</a></i>, to be written, directed and produced by Iannucci.

<p>On 2 April 2007, a UK DVD of the first six episodes was released as &#34;The Complete First Series&#34;. It also included audio commentary, deleted scenes, and photo galleries. The two specials were released on a second UK DVD in April 2009. The third series was released on UK DVD in April 2010, followed by a &#34;complete series&#34; box set (now outdated). Although the third series was filmed and broadcast on the BBC in <a href="/High_definition_video" title="High definition video">high definition video</a> there has been no release to date on <a href="/Blu-ray_disc" title="Blu-ray disc">Blu-ray disc</a>. A North American &#34;Series One to Three&#34; DVD box set was briefly scheduled for release in late 2012, but the release was delayed until Aug. 6, 2013, in order to allow all four seasons (plus specials) to be included in what was now a &#34;Complete Series&#34; release. The release date was announced by BBC Worldwide early in 2013, but coincidentally ended up occurring only two days after Peter Capaldi was announced as the new star of <i><a href="/Doctor_Who" title="Doctor Who">Doctor Who</a></i>. (Even more coincidental, a cast commentary included as part of a photo gallery featurette for the episode &#34;Rise of the Nutters&#34; included in the DVD set, recorded several years earlier, has several cast members jokingly deciding to start a rumor that Capaldi is to be the next Doctor.)</p>
