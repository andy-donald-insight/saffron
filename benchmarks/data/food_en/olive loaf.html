The  <a href="/Cold_cut" title="Cold cut">luncheon meat</a> often also contains <a href="/Garlic" title="Garlic">garlic</a>, <a href="/Basil" title="Basil">basil</a> or <a href="/Sweet_pepper" title="Sweet pepper">sweet peppers</a> for additional flavor.{{fact|date=August 2013}} Olive loaf is a loaf-type luncheon meat, traditionally cooked in a loaf pan as opposed to a <a href="/Sausage" title="Sausage">sausage</a> cooked in a casing. Higher quality olive loaf is primarily beef and pork while less expensive olive loaf contains mostly chicken or turkey.{{fact|date=August 2013}} Since most less expensive <a href="/Bologna_sausage" title="Bologna sausage">bologna</a> is made from similar meats, and since many companies now cook olive loaf in sleeves to give it a round appearance, it is a common misconception that olive loaf is a sausage like bologna.{{fact|date=August 2013}}</p>
<p><a href="/Pimento_loaf" title="Pimento loaf">Pimento loaf</a> is similar to olive loaf, the primary difference being that it incorporates pickles in place of the olives.</p>
