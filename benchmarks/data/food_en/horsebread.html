<b>Horsebread</b> was a type of bread sometimes consumed in <a href="/Medieval" title="Medieval">medieval</a> <a href="/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a>. This bread was, at the time, considered a low-quality bread, made from <a href="/Legume" title="Legume">legumes</a> such as dry <a href="/Split_pea" title="Split pea">split peas</a> as well as or instead of grains, and was one of the cheapest breads available. It was fed to <a href="/Horse" title="Horse">horses</a> but also eaten in times of famine by the <a href="/Indigent" title="Indigent">indigent</a> and those who could not afford <a href="/White_bread" title="White bread">white bread</a> (which was the most labour-intensive, and therefore expensive, bread) or other breads like <a href="/Rye_bread" title="Rye bread">rye</a> or <a href="/Barley_bread" title="Barley bread">barley breads</a>.&#60;ref name=&#34;Davis2004&#34;&#62;{{cite journal|last1=Davis|first1=James|title=Baking for the common good: a reassessment of the assize of bread in Medieval England|journal=The Economic History Review|volume=57|issue=3|year=2004|pages=465–502|issn=0013-0117|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0289.2004.00285.x}}&#60;/ref&#62;&#60;ref name=&#34;rubel&#34;&#62;{{cite journal|last1=rubel|first1=william|title=English Horse-bread, 1590-1800|journal=Gastronomica|volume=6|issue=3|year=2006|pages=40–51|issn=1529-3262|doi=10.1525/gfc.2006.6.3.40}}&#60;/ref&#62;
White breads were generally only eaten by the wealthy, because of the labor involved in refining flour and because of the lower nutritional content.  This is in contrast with modern whole grain breads, which are typically seen as premium-priced <a href="/Health_food" title="Health food">health foods</a> or <a href="/Gourmet" title="Gourmet">gourmet</a> foods.  This is in part because modern flour has a higher gluten content than flour produced in medieval Europe, and thus bread made from less refined flour is more palatable than it would have been during the Middle Ages.&#60;ref name=&#34;Sim&#34;&#62;{{cite book|last=Sim|first=Alison|title=The Tudor Housewife|year=1996|publisher=Sutton Publishing Limited|location=Glouchestershire|isbn=978-0-7735-2233-6|page=11}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
