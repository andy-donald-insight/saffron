A <b>Bundt cake</b> {{IPAc-en|b|ʌ|n|t}} is a <a href="/Cake" title="Cake">cake</a> that is baked in a <b>Bundt pan</b>, shaping it into a distinctive ring shape. The shape is inspired by a traditional European cake known as {{lang|de|<i><a href="/Gugelhupf" title="Gugelhupf">Gugelhupf</a></i>}}, but Bundt cakes are not generally associated with any single recipe. The style of mold in <a href="/North_America" title="North America">North America</a> was popularized in the 1950s and 60s, after cookware manufacturer <a href="/Nordic_Ware" title="Nordic Ware">Nordic Ware</a> trademarked the name &#34;Bundt&#34; and began producing Bundt pans from cast <a href="/Aluminum" title="Aluminum">aluminum</a>. Publicity from <a href="/Pillsbury_Company" title="Pillsbury Company">Pillsbury</a> saw the cakes gain widespread popularity.</p>

Bundt cakes do not conform to any single recipe; instead their characterizing feature is their shape. A Bundt pan generally has fluted or grooved sides, but its most defining design element is the central tube or &#34;chimney&#34; which leaves a cylindrical hole through the center of the cake. The design means that more of the mixture touches the surface of the pan than in a simple round pan, helping to provide faster and more even heat distribution during cooking.&#60;ref name=wpost/&#62;&#60;ref name=fante&#62;{{cite web

}}&#60;/ref&#62; The shape is similar to that of the earlier European {{lang|de|<i>Gugelhupf</i>}} or {{lang|de|<i>Bundkuchen</i>}}. A {{lang|de|<i>Gugelhupf</i>}} differs from contemporary Bundt-style cakes in that it follows a particular yeast-based recipe, with fruit and nuts, and is often deeper in shape and more decorative.&#60;ref name=oxford/&#62; Also similar in shape is the Eastern European <i><a href="/Babka_(cake)" title="Babka (cake)">Babka</a></i>, dating from early 18th century <a href="/Poland" title="Poland">Poland</a>.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.twojaeuropa.pl/1441/il-bab--ciastko-o-niezwyklym-smaku-i-historii" rel="nofollow">http://www.twojaeuropa.pl/1441/il-bab--ciastko-o-niezwyklym-smaku-i-historii</a>|title=Il Babà - ciastko o niezwykłym smaku i historii|date=17 March 2010|last=Berny|first=Iwona|language=Polish|trans_title=Babka: a cake with a unique flavor and history}}&#60;/ref&#62; While Babka is associated with Jewish culture, Bundt cake is firmly set in Christian tradition and is traditionally baked for <a href="/Christmas" title="Christmas">Christmas</a> and <a href="/Easter" title="Easter">Easter</a>.
Today, there is no recipe for &#34;Bundt cake&#34;. Anything can be baked in a Bundt-style pan, and is. Recipes range from <i>Pine Nut and Chili</i> cakes to ice cream and fruit concoctions. And, Bundt-style pan design has expanded beyond the original fluted ring to today&#39;s designs of skylines, octopus and cathedrals, all with the requisite hole in the center of the pan&#60;ref name=BundtBook/&#62; made by Nordic Ware and others.  Since a <a href="/Torus" title="Torus">toroidal</a> cake is rather difficult to <a href="/Icing_(food)" title="Icing (food)">frost</a>, Bundt cakes are typically either dusted with powdered sugar, drizzle-glazed, or served undecorated. Recipes specifically designed for Bundt pans often have a baked-in filling; Bundt <a href="/Pound_cake" title="Pound cake">pound cakes</a> are also common.{{cn|date=November 2013}}</p>
<p>Since the name &#34;Bundt&#34; is a <a href="/Trademark" title="Trademark">trademark</a>, similar pans are often sold as &#34;fluted tube pans&#34; or given other similar descriptive titles.&#60;ref name=fante/&#62; The trademark holder <a href="/Nordic_Ware" title="Nordic Ware">Nordic Ware</a> only produces Bundt pans in aluminum, but similar fluted pans are available in other materials.&#60;ref&#62;<a href="/File:Napfkuchen-Form.jpg" title="File:Napfkuchen-Form.jpg">File:Napfkuchen-Form.jpg</a>&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
