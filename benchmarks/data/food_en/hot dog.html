Claims about hot dog invention are difficult to assess, as stories assert the creation of the sausage, the placing of the sausage (or another kind of sausage) on bread or a bun as <a href="/Finger_food" title="Finger food">finger food</a>, the popularization of the existing dish, or the application of the name &#34;hot dog&#34; to a sausage and bun combination most commonly used with ketchup or mustard and sometimes relish.</p>
<p>The word <b>frankfurter</b> comes from <a href="/Frankfurt" title="Frankfurt">Frankfurt</a>, <a href="/Germany" title="Germany">Germany</a>, where <a href="/Pork" title="Pork">pork</a> sausages similar to hot dogs originated.&#60;ref&#62;{{OEtymD|frankfurter|accessdate=2009-10-17}}&#60;/ref&#62; These sausages, <i><a href="/Frankfurter_W%C3%BCrstchen" title="Frankfurter Würstchen">Frankfurter Würstchen</a></i>, were known since the 13th century and given to the people on the event of imperial coronations, starting with the coronation of <a href="/Maximilian_II%2C_Holy_Roman_Emperor" title="Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor">Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor</a> as King. <b>Wiener</b> refers to <a href="/Vienna" title="Vienna">Vienna, Austria</a>, whose <a href="/German_language" title="German language">German</a> name is &#34;Wien&#34;, home to a sausage made of a mixture of pork and beef&#60;ref&#62;{{OEtymD|wiener |accessdate=2009-10-17}}&#60;/ref&#62; (cf. <a href="/Hamburger" title="Hamburger">Hamburger</a>, whose name also derives from a German-speaking city). Johann Georg Lahner, a 18th/19th century butcher from the <a href="/Franconia" title="Franconia">Franconian</a> city of <a href="/Coburg" title="Coburg">Coburg</a>, is said to have brought the <i>Frankfurter Würstchen</i> to Vienna, where he added beef to the mixture and simply called it <i>Frankfurter</i>.&#60;ref&#62;{{harvcolnb|Schmidt|2003|p=241}}&#60;/ref&#62; Nowadays, in German speaking countries, except <a href="/Austria" title="Austria">Austria</a>, hot dog sausages are called <i>Wiener</i> or <i><a href="/Vienna_Sausage" title="Vienna Sausage">Wiener Würstchen</a></i> (<i>Würstchen</i> means &#34;little sausage&#34;), in differentiation to the original pork only mixture from Frankfurt. In <a href="/Swiss_German" title="Swiss German">Swiss German</a>, it is called <i>Wienerli</i>, while in Austria the terms <i>Frankfurter</i> or <i>Frankfurter Würstel</i> are used.</p>

<p> Others are credited with first serving hot dogs on rolls. A Bavarian immigrant named Feuchtwanger allegedly pioneered the practice in the American midwest; there are several versions of the story with varying details. According to one account, Antonoine Feuchtwanger&#39;s wife proposed the use of a bun in 1880: Feuchtwanger sold hot dogs on the streets of <a href="/St._Louis%2C_Missouri" title="St. Louis, Missouri">St. Louis, Missouri</a>, <a href="/United_States" title="United States">United States</a>, and provided gloves to his customers so that they could handle the sausages without burning their hands.  Losing money when customers did not return the gloves, Feuchtwanger&#39;s wife suggested serving the food in a roll instead.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|author=KiteFly Web Design - kitefly.com |url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.hotdogchicagostyle.com/history.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.hotdogchicagostyle.com/history.php</a> |title=Hot Dog History |publisher=Hotdogchicagostyle.com |accessdate=2012-03-05}}&#60;/ref&#62; In another version, Anton Ludwig Feuchtwanger served sausages in rolls at the <a href="/World&#39;s_Fair" title="World&#39;s Fair">World&#39;s Fair</a>–either the 1893 <a href="/World&#39;s_Columbian_Exposition" title="World&#39;s Columbian Exposition">World&#39;s Columbian Exposition</a> in Chicago or the 1904 <a href="/Louisiana_Purchase_Exposition" title="Louisiana Purchase Exposition">Louisiana Purchase Exposition</a> in St Louis&#60;ref&#62;{{harvcolnb|McCullough|2000|p=240}}&#60;/ref&#62;–again allegedly because the white gloves provided to customers to protect their hands were being kept as souvenirs.&#60;ref name=js&#62;{{harvcolnb|Jakle|Sculle|1999|pp=163–164}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>The association between hot dogs and baseball began as early as 1893 with <a href="/Chris_von_der_Ahe" title="Chris von der Ahe">Chris von der Ahe</a>, a German immigrant who owned not only the <a href="/St._Louis_Cardinals" title="St. Louis Cardinals">St. Louis Browns</a>, but also an amusement park.&#60;ref&#62;{{harvcolnb|McCollough|2006}}:<a class="external text" href="http://www.coveringsports.com/hotdog.htm" rel="nofollow">Frankfurter, she wrote: Hot dog shrouded in mystery</a>&#60;/ref&#62;</p>

Hot dogs are prepared commercially by mixing the ingredients (meats, spices, binders and fillers) in vats where rapidly moving blades grind and mix the ingredients in the same operation. This mixture is forced through tubes into casings for cooking. Most hot dogs sold in the US are &#34;skinless&#34; as opposed to more expensive &#34;natural casing&#34; hot dogs.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Natural_casing_hot_dogs">Natural casing hot dogs</span></h4>

Traditional casing is made from the <a href="/Small_intestine" title="Small intestine">small intestines</a> of <a href="/Sheep" title="Sheep">sheep</a>.

<p><a href="/Kosher" title="Kosher">Kosher</a> casings are expensive in commercial quantities in the US, so kosher hot dogs are usually skinless or made with reconstituted <a href="/Collagen" title="Collagen">collagen</a> casings.&#60;ref name=levine/&#62;</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Skinless_hot_dogs">Skinless hot dogs</span></h4>
<p>&#34;Skinless&#34; hot dogs must use a casing in the cooking process when the product is manufactured, but the casing is usually a long tube of thin cellulose that is removed between cooking and packaging.

<p>Skinless hot dogs vary in the texture of the product surface but have a softer &#34;bite&#34; than natural casing hot dogs. Skinless hot dogs are more uniform in shape and size than natural casing hot dogs and less expensive.</p>
