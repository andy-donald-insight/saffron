<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Etymology">Etymology</span></h2>
<p>The word <i>whisky</i> (or <i>whiskey</i>) is an <a href="/Anglicisation" title="Anglicisation">anglicisation</a> of the Classical <a href="/Goidelic_languages" title="Goidelic languages">Gaelic</a> word <i>uisce</i>/<i>uisge</i> meaning &#34;water&#34; (now written as <i>uisce</i> in Irish Gaelic, and <i>uisge</i> in Scottish Gaelic). Distilled alcohol was known in <a href="/Latin" title="Latin">Latin</a> as <i>aqua vitae</i> (&#34;water of life&#34;). This was translated to Classical Gaelic as {{lang-ga|uisce beatha}}/{{lang-gd|uisge beatha}} &#34;water of life&#34;. Early forms of the word in English included <i>uskebeaghe</i> (1581), <i>usquebaugh</i> (1610), <i>usquebath</i> (1621), <i>usquebae</i> (1715).&#60;ref&#62;<i>New English Dictionary on Historical Principles</i>, entries for <a class="external text" href="https://archive.org/stream/oedxaarch#page/n1057/mode/1up" rel="nofollow">&#34;usquebaugh&#34;</a> and <a class="external text" href="https://archive.org/stream/oedxbarch#page/n752/mode/1up" rel="nofollow">&#34;whisky&#34;</a>.&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Names_and_spellings">Names and spellings</span></h3>
<p>Much is made of the word&#39;s two spellings: <i>whisky</i> and <i>whiskey</i>.&#60;ref name=CowderySpelling2/&#62;&#60;ref name=CowderySpelling1/&#62; There are two schools of thought on the issue. One is that the spelling difference is simply a matter of regional language convention for the spelling of a word, indicating that the spelling varies depending on the intended audience or the background or personal preferences of the writer (like the difference between <i>color</i> and <i>colour</i>; <i>tire</i> and <i>tyre</i>; or <i>recognize</i> and <i>recognise</i>),&#60;ref name=CowderySpelling2&#62;Charles K.

There is general agreement that when quoting the proper name printed on a label, the spelling on the label should not be altered.&#60;ref name=CowderySpelling2/&#62;&#60;ref name=CowderySpelling1/&#62; Some writers refer to &#34;whisk(e)y&#34; or &#34;whisky/whiskey&#34; to acknowledge the variation.</p>

<p>Whiskies do not mature in the bottle, only in the <a href="/Barrel" title="Barrel">cask</a>, so the &#34;age&#34; of a whisky is only the time between distillation and bottling. This reflects how much the cask has interacted with the whisky, changing its chemical makeup and taste. Whiskies that have been bottled for many years may have a rarity value, but are not &#34;older&#34; and not necessarily &#34;better&#34; than a more recent whisky that matured in wood for a similar time. After a decade or two, additional aging in a barrel does not necessarily improve a whisky.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}</p>

Whisky or whisky-like products are produced in most grain-growing areas. They differ in base product, alcoholic content, and quality.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/Malt_whisky" title="Malt whisky">Malt whisky</a> is made primarily from <a href="/Malt" title="Malt">malted barley</a>.</li>
<li><a href="/Grain_whisky" title="Grain whisky">Grain whisky</a> is made from any type of grains.</li>
</ul>

<p>Malts and grains are combined in various ways:</p>

<ul>
<li><i><a href="/Single_malt_whisky" title="Single malt whisky">Single malt whisky</a></i> is whisky from a single distillery made from a mash that uses only one particular malted grain. Unless the whisky is described as <i>single-cask</i>, it contains whisky from many casks, and different years, so the blender can achieve a taste recognisable as typical of the distillery. In most cases, single malts bear the name of the distillery, with an age statement and perhaps some indication of some special treatments such as maturation in a <a href="/Port_wine" title="Port wine">port wine</a> cask.</li>
<li><i><a href="/Blended_malt_whisky" title="Blended malt whisky">Blended malt whisky</a></i> is a mixture of single malt whiskies from different distilleries. If a whisky is labelled &#34;pure malt&#34; or just &#34;malt&#34; it is almost certainly a blended malt whisky. This was formerly called a &#34;vatted malt&#34; whisky.</li>
<li><i><a href="/Blended_whisky" title="Blended whisky">Blended whisky</a></i> is made from a mixture of different types of whisky. A blend may contain whisky from many distilleries so that the blender can produce a flavour consistent with the brand. The brand name may, therefore, omit the name of a distillery. Most Scotch, Irish and Canadian whisky is sold as part of a blend, even when the spirits are the product of one distillery, as is common in Canada.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite book|title=Canadian Whisky: The Portable Expert| last=De Kergommeaux|first=Davin|year=2012|publisher=McClelland &#38; Stewart|isbn=978-0-7710-2743-7|page=58 }}&#60;/ref&#62; American blended whisky may contain <a href="/Neutral_spirits" title="Neutral spirits">neutral spirits</a>.</li>

<p>American whiskey is distilled from a fermented mash of <a href="/Cereal_grain" title="Cereal grain">cereal grain</a>. It must have the taste, aroma, and other characteristics commonly attributed to whiskey.</p>

Only water may be added to the final product; the addition of colouring or flavouring is prohibited. These whiskeys must be aged in new charred-oak containers, except for corn whiskey which does not have to be aged. If it is aged, it must be in uncharred oak barrels or in used barrels. Corn whiskey is usually unaged and sold as a legal version of <a href="/Moonshine" title="Moonshine">moonshine</a>.</p>
<p>If one of these whiskey types reaches two years aging or beyond, it is additionally designated as <i><a href="/Straight_whiskey" title="Straight whiskey">straight</a></i>, e.g., <i>straight rye whiskey</i>. A whiskey that fulfils all above requirements but derives from less than 51% of any one specific grain can be called simply a <i>straight whiskey</i> without naming a grain.</p>
<p>US regulations recognize other whiskey categories,&#60;ref name=cfr5.22/&#62; including:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/Blended_whiskey" title="Blended whiskey">Blended whiskey</a>—a mixture that contains a blend of straight whiskeys and <a href="/Neutral_grain_spirits" title="Neutral grain spirits">neutral grain spirits</a> (NGS), and may also contain flavourings and colourings. The percentage of NGS must be disclosed on the label and may be as much at 80% on a proof gallon basis.</li>
<li><a href="/Grain_whisky" title="Grain whisky">Light whiskey</a>—produced in the US at more than 80% <a href="/Alcohol_by_volume" title="Alcohol by volume">alcohol by volume</a> and stored in used or uncharred new oak containers</li>
<li><a href="/Spirit_whiskey" title="Spirit whiskey">Spirit whiskey</a>—a mixture of neutral spirits and at least 5% of certain stricter categories of whiskey</li>

<p>{{Main|Japanese whisky}}
The model for Japanese whiskies is the single malt Scotch, although there are also examples of Japanese blended whiskies. The base is a mash of malted barley, dried in kilns fired with a little peat (although considerably less than in Scotland), and distilled using the pot still method. Before 2000, Japanese whisky was primarily for the domestic market and exports were limited. Japanese whiskies such as Suntory and Nikka won many prestigious international awards between 2007 and 2014. Japanese whisky has earned a reputation for quality.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web |url= <a class="external free" href="http://www.nikka.com/eng/award/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nikka.com/eng/award/index.html</a> |title=Awards Won by Nikka Whisky | archiveurl = <a class="external free" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131217035526/http://www.nikka.com/eng/award/index.html" rel="nofollow">https://web.archive.org/web/20131217035526/http://www.nikka.com/eng/award/index.html</a> | archivedate = 17 December 2013 |publisher=Nikka.com |accessdate=15 April 2013}}&#60;/ref&#62;&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|author=Nicholas Coldicott|url=<a class="external free" href="http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fg20080523lc.html" rel="nofollow">http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fg20080523lc.html</a> | archiveurl = | archivedate = |title= Japanese malt scotches rivals |website=The Japan Times Online |date= 23 May 2008}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>

<p>{{Main|Welsh whisky}}
Although distillation of whisky in Wales began in Middle Ages there were no commercially operated distilleries during the 20th century. The rise of the temperance movement saw the decline the commercial production of liquor during the 19th century and in 1894 Welsh whisky production ceased.  Recently, however, there has been a revival of Welsh whisky.</p>
<p>The revival of Welsh whisky began in the 1990s.  Initially a &#34;Prince of Wales&#34; malt whisky was sold as Welsh whisky but was simply blended scotch bottled in Wales. A lawsuit by Scotch distillers ended this enterprise.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite news | url = <a class="external free" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/welsh-will-make-a-rare-bit-of-whiskey-718646.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/welsh-will-make-a-rare-bit-of-whiskey-718646.html</a> | title =Welsh will make a rare bit of whiskey | work =The Independent | accessdate=26 August 2009 | author =Amanda Kelly | date = 8 May 2000 }}&#60;/ref&#62; In 2000, Penderyn Distillery started production of  <a href="/Penderyn_(whisky)" title="Penderyn (whisky)">Penderyn single malt whisky</a>.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Flavours_from_treating_the_malt">Flavours from treating the malt</span></h3>
<p>The distinctive smoky flavour found in various types of whisky, especially Scotch&#60;!--single Islay malts particularly --&#62;, is due to the use of <a href="/Peat" title="Peat">peat</a> smoke to treat the malt.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Flavours_from_distillation">Flavours from distillation</span></h3>
<p>The flavouring of whisky is partially determined by the presence of <a href="/Congener_(alcohol)" title="Congener (alcohol)">congeners</a> and <a href="/Fusel_oil" title="Fusel oil">fusel oils</a>. Fusel oils are higher alcohols than <a href="/Ethanol" title="Ethanol">ethanol</a>, are mildly <a href="/Toxic" title="Toxic">toxic</a>, and have a strong, disagreeable smell and taste. An excess of fusel oils in whisky is considered a defect. A variety of methods are employed in the distillation process to remove unwanted fusel oils.  Traditionally, American distillers focused on secondary filtration using <a href="/Charcoal" title="Charcoal">charcoal</a>, <a href="/Gravel" title="Gravel">gravel</a>, <a href="/Sand" title="Sand">sand</a>, or <a href="/Linen" title="Linen">linen</a> to remove undesired distillates.</p>
<p><a href="/Acetal" title="Acetal">Acetals</a> are rapidly formed in distillates and a great many are found in distilled beverages, the most prominent being <a href="/Acetaldehyde" title="Acetaldehyde">acetaldehyde</a> diethyl acetal (<a href="/1%2C1-diethoxyethane" title="1,1-diethoxyethane">1,1-diethoxyethane</a>).

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Chill_filtration">Chill filtration</span></h3>
<p>Whisky is often &#34;<a href="/Chill_filtering" title="Chill filtering">chill filtered</a>&#34;: chilled to precipitate out fatty acid esters and then filtered to remove them. Most whiskies are bottled this way, unless specified as <i>unchillfiltered</i> or <i>non chill filtered</i>. This is done primarily for cosmetic reasons. Unchillfiltered whiskeys often turn cloudy when stored at cool temperatures or when cool water is added to them, and this is perfectly normal.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|title=Chill Filtration|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.whiskyforeveryone.com/whisky_basics/chill_filtration.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.whiskyforeveryone.com/whisky_basics/chill_filtration.html</a>|work=Whiskey Basics|publisher=Whisky for Everyone|accessdate=21 March 2013}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
