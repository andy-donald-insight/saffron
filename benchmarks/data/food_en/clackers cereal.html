<p><b>Clackers</b> was the name of a <a href="/Breakfast_cereal" title="Breakfast cereal">breakfast cereal</a> that <a href="/General_Mills" title="General Mills">the General Mills Corporation</a> manufactured and marketed in the 1960s and 1970s.</p>
<p>Noted for being promoted through TV commercials in which a box of the cereal would suddenly appear and interrupt some other activity, Clackers was a <a href="/Breakfast_cereal" title="Breakfast cereal">breakfast cereal</a> whose flavor was intended to be similar to that of <a href="/Graham_cracker" title="Graham cracker">graham crackers</a>. Each individual piece of the cereal was almost large enough to fit onto a teaspoon, and the shape of a typical piece resembled a small gear with a hole in the center.</p>
<p>Pre-sweetened, promoted as being nutritious, and formulated to be crunchy in milk for longer periods than the mean average for breakfast cereals, Clackers was primarily marketed for those younger than thirteen years of age.</p>
<p>But it was not a major success for General Mills, partially because the commercials, which many adult viewers considered annoying, actually overshadowed the cereal itself. The untimely delivery of toy dune buggies to be used in a promotion also doomed the cereal to failure.&#60;ref&#62;<i>Jay. V. Zimmerman Co. v. General Mills, Inc.</i> 327 F. Supp. 1198 (E.D. Mo. 1971)&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
