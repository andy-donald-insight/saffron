<b>Water</b> (chemical formula: <b>H&#60;sub&#62;2&#60;/sub&#62;O</b>) is a transparent fluid which forms the world&#39;s streams, lakes, oceans and rain, and is the major constituent of the fluids of organisms.

<p>Water appears in nature in all three common states of matter (solid, liquid, and gas) and may take many different forms on Earth: water vapor and <a href="/Cloud" title="Cloud">clouds</a> in the sky, <a href="/Seawater" title="Seawater">seawater</a> in the oceans, <a href="/Iceberg" title="Iceberg">icebergs</a> in the polar oceans, <a href="/Glacier" title="Glacier">glaciers</a> in the <a href="/Mountain" title="Mountain">mountains</a>, fresh and salt water <a href="/Lake" title="Lake">lakes</a>, <a href="/River" title="River">rivers</a>, and <a href="/Aquifer" title="Aquifer">aquifers</a> in the ground.</p>
<p>The major chemical and physical properties of water are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Water is a liquid at <a href="/Standard_conditions" title="Standard conditions">standard temperature and pressure</a>. It is tasteless and odorless. The intrinsic <a href="/Color_of_water" title="Color of water">color of water</a> and ice is a very slight blue hue, although both appear colorless in small quantities.

<li>Since the water molecule is not linear and the oxygen atom has a higher <a href="/Electronegativity" title="Electronegativity">electronegativity</a> than hydrogen atoms, the oxygen atom carries a slight negative charge, whereas the hydrogen atoms are slightly positive.

<li>Water is a good polar <a href="/Solvent" title="Solvent">solvent</a> and is often referred to as <i>the universal <a href="/Solvent" title="Solvent">solvent</a></i>.

<li>The <a href="/Boiling_point" title="Boiling point">boiling point</a> of water (and all other liquids) is dependent on the <a href="/Barometric_pressure" title="Barometric pressure">barometric pressure</a>. For example, on the top of <a href="/Mount_Everest" title="Mount Everest">Mount Everest</a> water boils at {{convert|68|°C}}, compared to {{convert|100|°C}} at <a href="/Sea_level" title="Sea level">sea level</a> at a similar latitude (since latitude modifies atmospheric pressure slightly).

These two unusual properties allow water to moderate Earth&#39;s <a href="/Climate" title="Climate">climate</a> by buffering large fluctuations in temperature.</li>
<li>The <a href="/Density" title="Density">density</a> of liquid water is {{convert|1000|kg/m3|lb/cuft|sigfig=4|abbr=on}} at 4&#38;nbsp;°C. Ice has a density of {{convert|917|kg/m3|lb/cuft|sigfig=4|abbr=on}}.</li>

<li>The maximum density of water occurs at {{convert|3.98|°C}}.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite book|author=Kotz, J. C., Treichel, P., &#38; Weaver, G. C.|year=2005|title=Chemistry &#38; Chemical Reactivity|publisher=Thomson Brooks/Cole|isbn=0-534-39597-X}}&#60;/ref&#62; Most known pure substances become more dense as they cool, however water has the anomalous property of becoming less dense when it is cooled to its solid form, ice. During cooling water becomes more dense until reaching 3.98&#38;nbsp;°C. Below this temperature, the open structure of ice is gradually formed in the low temperature water; the random orientations of the water molecules in the liquid are maintained by the thermal motion, and below 3.98&#38;nbsp;°C there is not enough thermal energy to maintain this randomness. As water is cooled there are two competing effects: 1) decreasing volume, and 2) increase overall volume of the liquid as the molecules begin to orient into the organized structure of ice. Between 3.98&#38;nbsp;°C and 0&#38;nbsp;°C, the second effect will cancel the first effect so the net effect is an increase of volume with decreasing temperature.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite book|last=Ben-Naim |first=Ariel |display-authors=etal |title= Alice&#39;s Adventures in Water-land</li>

When stars are born, their birth is accompanied by a strong outward wind of gas and dust. When this outflow of material eventually impacts the surrounding gas, the shock waves that are created compress and heat the gas.

<p>Earth&#39;s <a href="/Gravity" title="Gravity">gravity</a> allows it to hold an <a href="/Celestial_body_atmosphere" title="Celestial body atmosphere">atmosphere</a>.

<p>The <a href="/Water_cycle" title="Water cycle">water cycle</a> (known scientifically as the <b>hydrologic cycle</b>) refers to the continuous exchange of water within the <a href="/Hydrosphere" title="Hydrosphere">hydrosphere</a>, between the <a href="/Earth_atmosphere" title="Earth atmosphere">atmosphere</a>, <a href="/Soil" title="Soil">soil</a> water, <a href="/Surface_water" title="Surface water">surface water</a>, <a href="/Groundwater" title="Groundwater">groundwater</a>, and <a href="/Plant" title="Plant">plants</a>.</p>
<p>Water moves perpetually through each of these regions in the <i>water cycle</i> consisting of following transfer processes:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/Evaporation" title="Evaporation">evaporation</a> from oceans and other water bodies into the air and <a href="/Transpiration" title="Transpiration">transpiration</a> from land plants and animals into air.</li>
<li><a href="/Precipitation_(meteorology)" title="Precipitation (meteorology)">precipitation</a>, from water vapor condensing from the air and falling to earth or ocean.</li>
<li><a href="/Runoff_(water)" title="Runoff (water)">runoff</a> from the land usually reaching the <a href="/Sea" title="Sea">sea</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most water vapor over the oceans returns to the oceans, but winds carry water vapor over land at the same rate as runoff into the sea, about 47&#38;nbsp;<a href="/Metric_tonne_unit" title="Metric tonne unit">Tt</a> per year. Over land, evaporation and transpiration contribute another 72&#38;nbsp;Tt per year. Precipitation, at a rate of 119 Tt per year over land, has several forms: most commonly <a href="/Rain" title="Rain">rain</a>, <a href="/Snow" title="Snow">snow</a>, and <a href="/Hail" title="Hail">hail</a>, with some contribution from <a href="/Fog" title="Fog">fog</a> and <a href="/Dew" title="Dew">dew</a>.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite book|title=Water in Crisis: A Guide to the World&#39;s Freshwater Resources|editor=Gleick, P.H.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1993|page=15, Table 2.3|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/EarthSciences/Oceanography/?view=usa&#38;ci=9780195076288" rel="nofollow">http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/EarthSciences/Oceanography/?view=usa&#38;ci=9780195076288</a>}}&#60;/ref&#62; Dew is small drops of water that are condensed when a high density of water vapor meets a cool surface.

Some runoff water is trapped for periods of time, for example in lakes.
At high altitude, during winter, and in the far north and south, snow collects in ice caps, snow pack and glaciers.
Water also infiltrates the ground and goes into aquifers. This groundwater later flows back to the surface in <a href="/Spring_(hydrosphere)" title="Spring (hydrosphere)">springs</a>, or more spectacularly in <a href="/Hot_spring" title="Hot spring">hot springs</a> and <a href="/Geyser" title="Geyser">geysers</a>. Groundwater is also extracted artificially in <a href="/Water_well" title="Water well">wells</a>.
This water storage is important, since clean, fresh water is essential to human and other land-based life. In many parts of the world, it is in short supply.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Sea_water_and_tides">Sea water and tides</span></h3>
<p>{{Main|Seawater|Tides}}
<a href="/Seawater" title="Seawater">Sea water</a> contains about 3.5% <a href="/Sodium_chloride" title="Sodium chloride">salt</a> on average, plus smaller amounts of other substances. The physical properties of sea water differ from fresh water in some important respects. It freezes at a lower temperature (about −1.9&#38;nbsp;°C) and its density increases with decreasing temperature to the freezing point, instead of reaching maximum density at a temperature above freezing. The salinity of water in major seas varies from about 0.7% in the <a href="/Baltic_Sea" title="Baltic Sea">Baltic Sea</a> to 4.0% in the <a href="/Red_Sea" title="Red Sea">Red Sea</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/Tide" title="Tide">Tides</a> are the cyclic rising and falling of local sea levels caused by the <a href="/Tidal_force" title="Tidal force">tidal forces</a> of the Moon and the Sun acting on the oceans. Tides cause changes in the depth of the marine and <a href="/Estuary" title="Estuary">estuarine</a> water bodies and produce oscillating currents known as tidal streams.
The changing tide produced at a given location is the result of the changing positions of the Moon and Sun relative to the Earth coupled with the <a href="/Coriolis_effect" title="Coriolis effect">effects of Earth rotation</a> and the local <a href="/Bathymetry" title="Bathymetry">bathymetry</a>. The strip of seashore that is submerged at high tide and exposed at low tide, the <a href="/Intertidal_zone" title="Intertidal zone">intertidal zone</a>, is an important ecological product of ocean tides.</p>

<p>
From a <a href="/Biology" title="Biology">biological</a> standpoint, water has many distinct properties that are critical for the proliferation of <a href="/Life" title="Life">life</a>. It carries out this role by allowing <a href="/Organic_compound" title="Organic compound">organic compounds</a> to react in ways that ultimately allow <a href="/Self-replication" title="Self-replication">replication</a>. All known forms of life depend on water. Water is vital both as a <a href="/Solvent" title="Solvent">solvent</a> in which many of the body&#39;s solutes dissolve and as an essential part of many <a href="/Metabolism" title="Metabolism">metabolic</a> processes within the body. Metabolism is the sum total of anabolism and catabolism. In anabolism, water is removed from molecules (through energy requiring enzymatic chemical reactions) in order to grow larger molecules (e.g. starches, triglycerides and proteins for storage of fuels and information). In catabolism, water is used to break bonds in order to generate smaller molecules (e.g. glucose, fatty acids and amino acids to be used for fuels for energy use or other purposes). Without water, these particular metabolic processes could not exist.</p>
<p>Water is fundamental to photosynthesis and respiration. Photosynthetic cells use the sun&#39;s energy to split off water&#39;s hydrogen from oxygen. Hydrogen is combined with CO&#60;sub&#62;2&#60;/sub&#62; (absorbed from air or water) to form glucose and release oxygen. All living cells use such fuels and oxidize the hydrogen and carbon to capture the sun&#39;s energy and reform water and CO&#60;sub&#62;2&#60;/sub&#62; in the process (cellular respiration).</p>
<p>Water is also central to acid-base neutrality and enzyme function. An acid, a hydrogen ion (H&#60;sup&#62;+&#60;/sup&#62;, that is, a proton) donor, can be neutralized by a base, a proton acceptor such as a hydroxide ion (OH&#60;sup&#62;−&#60;/sup&#62;) to form water. Water is considered to be neutral, with a <a href="/PH" title="PH">pH</a> (the negative log of the hydrogen ion concentration) of 7. <a href="/Acids" title="Acids">Acids</a> have pH values less than 7 while <a href="/Base_(chemistry)" title="Base (chemistry)">bases</a> have values greater than 7.</p>

Water fit for human consumption is called drinking water or <a href="/Potable_water" title="Potable water">potable water</a>. Water that is not potable may be made potable by filtration or <a href="/Distillation" title="Distillation">distillation</a>, or by a range of <a href="/Water_treatment" title="Water treatment">other methods</a>.</p>
<p>Water that is not fit for drinking but is not harmful for humans when used for swimming or bathing is called by various names other than potable or drinking water, and is sometimes called <a href="/Safe_water" title="Safe water">safe water</a>, or &#34;safe for bathing&#34;. Chlorine is a skin and mucous membrane irritant that is used to make water safe for bathing or drinking. Its use is highly technical and is usually monitored by government regulations (typically 1 part per million (ppm) for drinking water, and 1–2 ppm of chlorine not yet reacted with impurities for bathing water). Water for bathing may be maintained in satisfactory microbiological condition using chemical disinfectants such as <a href="/Chlorine" title="Chlorine">chlorine</a> or <a href="/Ozone" title="Ozone">ozone</a> or by the use of <a href="/Ultraviolet" title="Ultraviolet">ultraviolet</a> light.</p>
<p>In the USA, non-potable forms of <a href="/Wastewater" title="Wastewater">wastewater</a> generated by humans may be referred to as <a href="/Greywater" title="Greywater">greywater</a>, which is treatable and thus easily able to be made potable again, and <a href="/Blackwater_(waste)" title="Blackwater (waste)">blackwater</a>, which generally contains <a href="/Sewage" title="Sewage">sewage</a> and other forms of waste which require <a href="/Sewage_treatment" title="Sewage treatment">further treatment</a> in order to be made reusable. Greywater composes 50–80% of residential wastewater generated by a household&#39;s sanitation equipment (<a href="/Sink" title="Sink">sinks</a>, <a href="/Shower" title="Shower">showers</a> and <a href="/Kitchen" title="Kitchen">kitchen</a> runoff, but not <a href="/Toilet" title="Toilet">toilets</a>, which generate blackwater.) These terms may have different meanings in other countries and cultures.</p>
<p>This natural resource is becoming scarcer in certain places, and its availability is a major social and economic concern. Currently, about a billion people around the world routinely drink unhealthy water. Most countries accepted the goal of halving by 2015 the number of people worldwide who do not have access to safe water and <a href="/Sanitation" title="Sanitation">sanitation</a> during the <a href="/29th_G8_summit" title="29th G8 summit">2003 G8 Evian summit</a>.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.g8.fr/evian/english/navigation/2003_g8_summit/summit_documents/water_-_a_g8_action_plan.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.g8.fr/evian/english/navigation/2003_g8_summit/summit_documents/water_-_a_g8_action_plan.html</a>|title=G8 &#34;Action plan&#34; decided upon at the 2003 Evian summit|publisher=G8.fr|date=2 June 2003|accessdate=25 July 2010}}&#60;/ref&#62; Even if this difficult goal is met, it will still leave more than an estimated half a billion people without access to safe drinking water and over a billion without access to adequate sanitation.

<p>Water, however, is not a finite resource, but rather re-circulated as potable water in precipitation in quantities many degrees of magnitude higher than human consumption. Therefore, it is the relatively small quantity of water in reserve in the earth (about 1% of our drinking <a href="/Water_supply" title="Water supply">water supply</a>, which is replenished in aquifers around every 1 to 10 years), that is a <a href="/Non-renewable_resource" title="Non-renewable resource">non-renewable resource</a>, and it is, rather, the distribution of potable and irrigation water which is scarce, rather than the actual amount of it that exists on the earth. Water-poor countries use importation of goods as the primary method of importing water (to leave enough for local human consumption), since the manufacturing process uses around 10 to 100 times products&#39; masses in water.</p>
<p>In the developing world, 90% of all <a href="/Wastewater" title="Wastewater">wastewater</a> still goes untreated into local rivers and streams.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite book|title=Environmentally Sound Technology for Wastewater and Stormwater Management: An International Source Book|author=UNEP International Environment|year=2002|publisher=IWA Publishing|isbn=1-84339-008-6|oclc=49204666}}&#60;/ref&#62; Some 50 countries, with roughly a third of the world&#39;s population, also suffer from medium or high water stress, and 17 of these extract more water annually than is recharged through their natural water cycles.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite book|title=Climate Change and Developing Countries|last=Ravindranath|first=Nijavalli H.|author2=Jayant A.

<p>Fifty years ago, the common perception was that water was an infinite resource. At this time, there were fewer than half the current number of people on the planet. People were not as wealthy as today, consumed fewer calories and ate less meat, so less water was needed to produce their food.

<p>Drinking water is often collected at <a href="/Spring_(hydrosphere)" title="Spring (hydrosphere)">springs</a>, extracted from artificial <a href="/Boring_(earth)" title="Boring (earth)">borings</a> (wells) in the ground, or pumped from lakes and rivers. Building more wells in adequate places is thus a possible way to produce more water, assuming the aquifers can supply an adequate flow. Other water sources include rainwater collection. Water may require purification for human consumption. This may involve removal of undissolved substances, dissolved substances and harmful <a href="/Microbe" title="Microbe">microbes</a>.

<p>Polluting water may be the biggest single misuse of water; to the extent that a pollutant limits other uses of the water, it becomes a waste of the resource, regardless of benefits to the polluter. Like other types of pollution, this does not enter standard accounting of market costs, being conceived as <a href="/Externality" title="Externality">externalities</a> for which the market cannot account. Thus other people pay the price of water pollution, while the private firms&#39; profits are not redistributed to the local population, victims of this pollution. <a href="/Pharmaceuticals" title="Pharmaceuticals">Pharmaceuticals</a> consumed by humans often end up in the waterways and can have detrimental effects on <a href="/Marine_biology" title="Marine biology">aquatic</a> life if they <a href="/Bioaccumulation" title="Bioaccumulation">bioaccumulate</a> and if they are not <a href="/Biodegradable" title="Biodegradable">biodegradable</a>.</p>

Thales, a <a href="/Monist" title="Monist">monist</a>, believed further that all things are made from water.  Plato believed the shape of water is an <a href="/Icosahedron" title="Icosahedron">icosahedron</a> which accounts for why it is able to flow easily compared to the cube-shaped earth.&#60;ref&#62;Lindberg, D. (2008). <i>The beginnings of western science: The European scientific tradition in philosophical, religious, and institutional context, prehistory to A.D. 1450</i>. (2nd ed.).

<p>In the theory of the <a href="/Humorism" title="Humorism">four bodily humors</a>, water was associated with <a href="/Phlegm" title="Phlegm">phlegm</a>, as being cold and moist. The <a href="/Water_(classical_element)" title="Water (classical element)">classical element of water</a> was also one of the <a href="/Five_elements_(Chinese_philosophy)" title="Five elements (Chinese philosophy)">five elements</a> in traditional <a href="/Chinese_philosophy" title="Chinese philosophy">Chinese philosophy</a>, along with <a href="/Earth_(classical_element)" title="Earth (classical element)">earth</a>, <a href="/Fire_(classical_element)" title="Fire (classical element)">fire</a>, <a href="/Wood_(classical_element)" title="Wood (classical element)">wood</a>, and <a href="/Metal_(classical_element)" title="Metal (classical element)">metal</a>.</p>
<p>Water is also taken as a role model in some parts of traditional and popular Asian philosophy. James Legge&#39;s 1891 translation of the Dao De Jing states &#34;The highest excellence is like (that of) water. The excellence of water appears in its benefiting all things, and in its occupying, without striving (to the contrary), the low place which all men dislike. Hence (its way) is near to (that of) the Tao&#34; and &#34;There is nothing in the world more soft and weak than water, and yet for attacking things that are firm and strong there is nothing that can take precedence of it—for there is nothing (so effectual) for which it can be changed.&#34;&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/tao/taote.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.sacred-texts.com/tao/taote.htm</a>|title=Internet Sacred Text Archive Home|publisher=Sacred-texts.com|accessdate=25 July 2010}}&#60;/ref&#62; <i><a href="/Guanzi_(text)" title="Guanzi (text)">Guanzi</a></i> in &#34;Shui di&#34; 水地 chapter further elaborates on symbolism of water, proclaiming that &#34;man is water&#34; and attributing natural qualities of the people of different Chinese regions to the character of local water resources.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://ctext.org/guanzi/shui-di" rel="nofollow">Guanzi : Shui Di – Chinese Text Project</a>.
