<p>In 1995, evidence of large-scale <a href="/Mesolithic" title="Mesolithic">Mesolithic</a> nut processing, some 9,000 years old, was found in a <a href="/Midden" title="Midden">midden</a> pit on the island of <a href="/Colonsay" title="Colonsay">Colonsay</a> in Scotland. The evidence consists of a large, shallow pit full of the remains of hundreds of thousands of burned hazelnut shells. Hazelnuts have been found on other Mesolithic sites, but rarely in such quantities or concentrated in one pit. The nuts were <a href="/Radiocarbon_dating" title="Radiocarbon dating">radiocarbon dated</a> to 7720+/-110BP, which calibrates to <i>circa</i> 7000 BC. Similar sites in Britain are known only at <a href="/Farnham" title="Farnham">Farnham</a> in <a href="/Surrey" title="Surrey">Surrey</a> and Cass ny Hawin on the <a href="/Isle_of_Man" title="Isle of Man">Isle of Man</a>.&#60;ref name=&#34;Nuts1&#34;&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.britarch.ac.uk/BA/ba5/ba5news.html" rel="nofollow">&#34;Mesolithic food industry on Colonsay&#34;</a> Dec 1995) <i>British Archaeology</i>.

<p>This discovery gives an insight into communal activity and planning in the period. The nuts were harvested in a single year, and <a href="/Pollen_analysis" title="Pollen analysis">pollen analysis</a> suggests the <a href="/Hazel" title="Hazel">hazel</a> trees were all cut down at the same time.&#60;ref name=Moff /&#62; The scale of the activity, unparalleled elsewhere in Scotland, and the lack of large game on the island, suggest the possibility that Colonsay contained a community with a largely vegetarian diet for the time they spent on the island. The pit was originally on a beach close to the shore, and was associated with two smaller, stone-lined pits whose function remains obscure, a hearth, and a second cluster of pits.&#60;ref name=&#34;Nuts1&#34; /&#62;</p>
<p>Because hazelnuts do not generally need to be toasted, indeed Kentish Cobnuts are still traditionally sold fresh, it has been speculated this was done to make them more digestible for children. Toasting the nuts was thought to increase how long they would keep, and they have historically been a useful food for mariners because they keep well.</p>
<p>Hazel has been grown historically in <a href="/Coppicing" title="Coppicing">coppices</a> for use in <a href="/Wattle_and_daub" title="Wattle and daub">wattle and daub</a> buildings, and in hedges. The Romans cultivated hazelnuts, including in Britain, although there is no evidence that they spread specific cultivars. Cultivated varieties have been grown since at least the 16th century, with a great increase in varieties during the 1800s. In particular, the first really widespread cultivar, the Kentish Cobnut, was introduced in 1830.</p>
<p>The traditional method to increase nut production is called &#39;brutting&#39;, which involves prompting more of the trees&#39; energy to go into flower bud production, by snapping but not breaking off the tips of the new year&#39;s shoots six or seven leaf groups from the join with the trunk or branch, at the end of the growing season. The traditional term for an area of cultivated hazelnuts is a plat.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Modern_cultivation">Modern cultivation</span></h2>
<p>The harvesting of hazelnuts is done either by hand or by manual or mechanical raking of fallen nuts. Common hazel is widely cultivated for its nuts, including in commercial <a href="/Orchard" title="Orchard">orchards</a> in Europe, Turkey, Iran and the <a href="/Caucasus" title="Caucasus">Caucasus</a>. The name &#34;hazelnut&#34; applies to the nuts of any of the species of the genus <i>Corylus</i>. This hazelnut, the kernel of the <a href="/Seed" title="Seed">seed</a>, is edible and used raw or roasted, or ground into a <a href="/Spread_(food)" title="Spread (food)">paste</a>. The seed has a thin, dark brown skin, which has a <a href="/Taste#Bitterness" title="Taste">bitter</a> flavour and is sometimes removed before cooking.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Harvesting">Harvesting</span></h2>
<p>Hazelnuts are harvested annually in mid-autumn. As autumn comes to a close, the trees drop their nuts and leaves. Most commercial growers wait for the nuts to drop on their own, rather than use equipment to shake them from the tree.</p>
<p>Four primary pieces of equipment are used in commercial harvesting: the sweeper, the harvester, the nut cart and the forklift. The sweeper moves the nuts into the center of the rows, the harvester lifts and separates the nuts from any debris (i.e. twigs and leaves), the nut cart holds the nuts picked up by the harvester, and the forklift brings a tote to offload the nuts from the nut cart and then stacks the totes to be shipped to the processor (nut dryer).
The sweeper is a low-to-the-ground machine that makes two passes in each tree row.  It has a {{convert|2|m}} belt attached to the front that rotates to sweep leaves, nuts, and small twigs from left to right, depositing the material in the row&#39;s center as it drives forward. On the rear of the sweeper is a powerful blower to blow material left into the adjacent row with air speeds up to {{convert|90|m/s}}. Careful grooming during the year and patient blowing at harvest can eliminate the need for hand raking around the trunk of the tree, where nuts can accumulate.  The sweeper prepares a single center row of nuts narrow enough for the harvesting tractor to drive over without driving on the center row.  It is best to only sweep a few rows ahead of the harvesters at any given time, to prevent the tractor that drives the harvester from crushing the nuts that may still be falling from the trees.  Hazelnut orchards may be harvested up to three times during the harvest season, depending on the quantity of nuts in the trees and the rate of nut drop as a result of weather.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.omafra.gov.on.ca/english/crops/facts/12-011.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.omafra.gov.on.ca/english/crops/facts/12-011.htm</a>|title=Hazelnuts in Ontario – Growing, Harvesting and Food Safety|work=gov.on.ca}}&#60;/ref&#62;

<p>
The harvester is a slow-moving machine pushed by a tractor, which lifts the material off the ground and separates the nuts from the leaves, empty husks, and twigs. As the harvester drives over the rows, a rotating cylinder with hundreds of tines rakes the material onto a belt.  The belt takes the material over a blower and under a powerful vacuum that sucks the lightweight dirt and leaves from the nuts, and discharges it into the orchard.  The remaining nuts are conveyed into a nut cart pulled behind the harvester. Once a tote is filled with nuts, the forklift will haul away the full totes and bring empties back to the harvester to maximize the harvester&#39;s time.</p>
<p>Two different timing strategies are used for collecting the fallen nuts. The first is to harvest early when approximately half of the nuts have fallen. With less material on the ground, the harvester can work faster with less chance of a breakdown. The second option is to wait for all the nuts to fall before harvesting. Though the first option is considered the better of the two,&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.yeniansiklopedi.com/findik/" rel="nofollow">http://www.yeniansiklopedi.com/findik/</a>|title=yeniansiklopedi.com - This website is for sale! - Encyclopedia Resources and Information.|work=yeniansiklopedi.com}}&#60;/ref&#62; two or three passes do take more time to complete than one.  Weather must also be a consideration.  Rain inhibits harvest and should a farmer wait for all the nuts to fall after a rainy season, it becomes much more difficult to harvest.  Pickup also varies with how many acres are being farmed and the number of sweepers, harvesters, nut carts and forklifts available.</p>
<p>A dry orchard can be dusty, so equipment operators should wear breathing protection. Conversely, if it is too wet, mud cakes in the machinery and moisture weighs down the material, making it impossible for the equipment to function without picking up large quantities of mud.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}</p>
