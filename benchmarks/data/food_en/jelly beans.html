<p>Most jelly beans are sold as an assortment of around eight different flavors, most of them fruit-based. Assortments of &#34;spiced&#34; jellybeans and <a href="/Gumdrop" title="Gumdrop">gumdrops</a> are also available, which include a similar number of spice and mint flavors. The colors of jelly beans often correspond with a fruit and a &#34;spiced&#34; flavor.</p>
<p>Some premium brands, such as <a href="/Jelly_Belly" title="Jelly Belly">Jelly Belly</a> and The Jelly Bean Factory, are available in many different flavors, including berry, tropical fruit, soft drink, popcorn, licorice, and novelty ranges, in addition to the familiar fruit and spice flavors. While these are also sold as assortments, individual flavors can be individually purchased from distributors. A version of the Bertie Botts Every Flavor Beans from the <a href="/Harry_Potter_series" title="Harry Potter series">Harry Potter series</a> was made commercially available and included flavors described as <a href="/Earwax" title="Earwax">earwax</a>, <a href="/Dirt" title="Dirt">dirt</a>, <a href="/Black_pepper" title="Black pepper">pepper</a>, and <a href="/Vomiting" title="Vomiting">vomit</a>.</p>
<p>There are other candy products that also have a hard candy shell and a gummy interior, such as <a href="/Skittles_(confectionery)" title="Skittles (confectionery)">Skittles</a>. However, these are not marketed as jelly beans and are not typically referred to as such.</p>

<p>In the <a href="/Electronics" title="Electronics">electronics</a> industry, a &#34;jelly bean&#34; component is one which is widely available, used generically in many applications, and has no very unusual characteristicsâ€”as though it might be grabbed out of a jar in handfuls when needed, like jelly beans. For example, the 741 might be considered a jelly bean <a href="/Operational_amplifier" title="Operational amplifier">operational amplifier</a>.</p>
<p>In United States <a href="/Slang" title="Slang">slang</a> in the 1910s and early 1920s, a &#34;Jellybean&#34; or &#34;Jelly-Bean&#34; was a young man who dressed stylishly to attract women but had little else to recommend him, similar to the older terms <i><a href="/Dandy" title="Dandy">dandy</a></i> and <i><a href="/Fop" title="Fop">fop</a></i> and the slightly later <i>drugstore cowboy</i>.   <a href="/F._Scott_Fitzgerald" title="F.

<p>The song &#34;Jelly Bean (He&#39;s a Curbstone Cutie)&#34; was made popular in the 1940s by <a href="/Phil_Harris" title="Phil Harris">Phil Harris</a>.
