<p><b>Lazar√°kia</b> (&#34;Little Lazaruses&#34;) are small, sweet <a href="/Spice" title="Spice">spice</a> <a href="/Bread" title="Bread">breads</a> made by <a href="/Greek_Orthodox_Church" title="Greek Orthodox Church">Greek Orthodox Christians</a> on <a href="/Lazarus_Saturday" title="Lazarus Saturday">Lazarus Saturday</a>, the Saturday that begins <a href="/Holy_Week" title="Holy Week">Holy Week</a>. They are eaten to celebrate the miracle of <a href="/Jesus" title="Jesus">Jesus</a> raising <a href="/Lazarus_of_Bethany" title="Lazarus of Bethany">Lazarus</a> from the dead. They are shaped like a man wrapped in a <a href="/Shroud" title="Shroud">shroud</a>, supposedly Saint <a href="/Lazarus_of_Bethany" title="Lazarus of Bethany">Lazarus of Bethany</a>, with <a href="/Clove" title="Clove">cloves</a> for eyes.  They contain several sweet spices and are a fasting <a href="/Lenten" title="Lenten">Lenten</a> food, meaning that they do not contain any dairy products or eggs. For that reason, unlike the <a href="/Tsoureki" title="Tsoureki">tsourekia</a>, they are brushed with <a href="/Olive_oil" title="Olive oil">olive oil</a> instead of <a href="/Egg_(food)" title="Egg (food)">egg</a> or <a href="/Butter" title="Butter">butter</a> for a gloss finish.</p>
