<p><b>Pork rind</b> is the skin (rind) of a pig. Pork rind is a common ingredient of <a href="/Sausage" title="Sausage">sausages</a>, which helps to improve their consistency. Fried or roasted pork rind and fat is also a snack. The frying <a href="/Rendering_(animals)" title="Rendering (animals)">renders</a> much of the fat that is attached to the uncooked rind, causing the cooked product to reduce considerably in size. The product may be known by alternative names, such as <b>pork scratchings</b> or <b>pork crackling</b> in the UK, although the term crackling may also refer to the rind atop a roasted pork joint.&#60;ref name=&#34;freshersfoods&#34;&#62;{{cite web|url=<a class="external free" href="http://freshersfoods.com/history-of-pork-scratchings/" rel="nofollow">http://freshersfoods.com/history-of-pork-scratchings/</a>|publisher=Freshers Foods |title=History of pork scratchings|accessdate=1 November 2012}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>

In many ancient cultures, <a href="/Animal_fat" title="Animal fat">animal fats</a> were the only way of obtaining <a href="/Cooking_oil" title="Cooking oil">oil for cooking</a> and it was common in many people&#39;s diet until the <a href="/Industrial_revolution" title="Industrial revolution">industrial revolution</a> made <a href="/Vegetable_oil" title="Vegetable oil">vegetable oils</a> more common and more affordable.</p>
<p><a href="/Microwave_Oven" title="Microwave Oven">Microwaveable</a> pork rinds are sold in bags that resemble microwaveable <a href="/Popcorn" title="Popcorn">popcorn</a> (although not exhibiting the popping sound) and can be eaten still warm. <a href="/Pickling" title="Pickling">Pickled</a> pork rinds, on the other hand, are often enjoyed refrigerated and cold.

<p>For the large scale production of commercial pork rinds, frozen, dried pork skin pellets are used. They are first rehydrated in water with added flavouring, and then fried in pork fat at 200-210 degrees Celsius. Cooking makes the rinds expand and float on the oil surface. The rinds are then removed from the fat, flavoured and air dried. <a href="/Antioxidant" title="Antioxidant">Antioxidants</a> may be added to improve stability.&#60;ref name=&#34;LusasRooney2001&#34;&#62;{{cite book|author1=Edmund W.

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Mexico">Mexico</span></h4>
<p><a href="/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> is one of the world&#39;s largest producers and consumers of pork rinds, known as <a href="/Chicharr%C3%B3n" title="Chicharrón">chicharrón</a> it may still have fat attached, called chicharrón con gordo &#34;pork rind with fat&#34; (as in overweight).</p>
<p>It is commonly served in homes across Mexico. It can be served in a soup sometimes called &#34;chicharrón en salsa&#34; (pork rind with sauce) or &#34;salsa de chicharrón&#34; (pork rind sauce). It is often served as an appetizer, or even offered as snack in family reunions.  However, chicharrones can be purchased on the street and are, usually, eaten with hot sauce and lime juice. </p>
<p>One popular breakfast is salsa de chicharron, (also chicharrón en salsa in some regions) cooked in green tomato or tomato salsa spiced with epazote. If liquid is drained then is used in tacos, beside other tacos in the same menu: potato tacos, <a href="/Moronga" title="Moronga">moronga</a> tacos, guacamole tacos, meat tacos, stuffed chile tacos, either as fast food products or kitchen made.</p>
<p>The dryness in pork rind pairs perfectly with humidity and softness in <i>pico de gallo</i> and both fills perfectly a corn tortilla as taco.</p>
<p>While most pork rinds are fried and eaten in crispy way, not all the pork skin reaches the frier, as some of the skin free of fat is pickled in a pork feet recipe.</p>
<p>A by-product in frying rinds is the decanted residues in fryer called &#34;asiento&#34; or &#34;boronas&#34; (grounds). The process requires moving rinds to uniform cooking and while the product dehydrates it cracks, losing small pieces, after collected becomes a thick, fatty salsa, that can be mixed as an ingredient in other salsa de chicharrón recipe or used for savory and fat in pan frying. Obviously a second by-product in frying rinds is lard.</p>
<p>Cueritos are the same as pork rinds but are soft and chewy, as they are not heavily cooked unlike the chicharrón,  which is very crispy and often overcooked. They are easily available in Mexico as <a href="/Antojo" title="Antojo">antojo</a> and sold on the streets usually by butchers, oftentimes served fresh, but you can also find them marinated with vinegar  and onion on &#34;tienditas&#34;, popular convenience stores where the clerk is usually the owner. If marinated, they are served with lemon and salt, powdered chili and probably with &#34;salsa Valentina&#34;.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="United_States">United States</span></h4>
<p>Pork rinds, sometimes cracklings, is the American name for fried or roasted skins of pigs, <a href="/Goose" title="Goose">geese</a> or other animals, regardless of the status or amount of pork in the snack. Pieces of fried meat, skin, or membrane produced as a byproduct of rendering <a href="/Lard" title="Lard">lard</a> are also called cracklings. Cracklings consist of either roasted or fried pork rind that has had salt rubbed into it and scored with a sharp knife: &#34;a crackling offers a square of skin that cracks when you bite into it, giving way to a little pocket of hot fat and a salty layer of pork meat.&#34;&#60;ref name=&#34;pigskins&#34;/&#62;</p>

<p><b>Pork scratchings</b> is the British name for deep-fried, salted, crunchy pork rind with fat produced separately from the meat. This is then eaten cold.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite news|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/03/dining/03skin.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/03/dining/03skin.html</a>|title=For the Big Game? Why, Pigskins|publisher=The New York Times|date=2 February 2010 |accessdate=7 October 2010|first=Kim|last=Severson}}&#60;/ref&#62; Pork scratchings typically are heavy and hard, have a crispy layer of fat under the skin, and are flavored only with salt. The pig hair is usually removed by quickly burning the skin of the pig before it is cut into pieces and cooked in hot fat. In comparison, <b>Crackling</b> is distinguished from normal pork rind in the United Kingdom by the fact that it is cut from a freshly-roasted joint of pork (Usually a <a href="/Pork_loin" title="Pork loin">Pork loin</a> or <a href="/Pork_chop" title="Pork chop">Pork chops</a>) after the meat has finished cooking and is usually served warm or hot, before the fat on the underside of the roasted skin can finish cooling down and re-solidifying.</p>
<p>Pork scratchings are sold as a <a href="/Snack_food" title="Snack food">snack food</a> in the same way pork rinds are in the USA. Unlike the physically large, but relatively light bags of &#39;deep-fried skin without the fat&#39; sold around the world, in the UK they are sold in relatively small bags, which usually weigh between 42g and 90g. Traditionally, they are eaten as an accompaniment to a <a href="/Beer" title="Beer">pint of beer</a> in a <a href="/Pub" title="Pub">pub</a>, just like <a href="/Crisps" title="Crisps">crisps</a> or peanuts.

<p>This food is believed to have originated in the West Midlands or Black Country,{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} where they were widely consumed by the working classes. The pork scratching dates back to the 1800s, when families kept their own pigs as a source of food; in order to not waste any element of the pig, due to the scarcity of food, even the offcuts of fat and skin were fried for food.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}</p>
<p>There are three distinct types. Traditional scratchings are made from shank rind and cooked just once. Pork crackling is also made from shoulder rind, but is fried twice. It is first rendered at a low heat, and then cooked at a higher temperature for a less fatty, crispier result, or cut from roasted pork joints to produce heavier but less fatty results. A more recent development is the pork crunch, which is made from back rind and again double-fried to become a large, puffy snack.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite news|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/rind-of-the-times-732905.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/rind-of-the-times-732905.html</a>|title=Rind of the Times | work=The Independent | date=22 June 2004|location=London}}&#60;/ref&#62; Some supermarkets now sell just the layer of skin and fat (no meat), in a raw form for home grilling or roasting, or cooked and ready to eat from hot food counters. The term &#39;crackling&#39; is also often applied to a twice-cooked variety of pork scratchings.</p>
