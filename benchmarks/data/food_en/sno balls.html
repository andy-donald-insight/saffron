<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>
<p>Sno Balls were first introduced in 1947.&#60;ref name=snoball&#62;{{cite web|title=Sno Balls|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.hostesscakes.com/snoballs.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.hostesscakes.com/snoballs.asp</a>|publisher=<a href="/Hostess_(brand)" title="Hostess (brand)">Hostess</a>|accessdate=2012-02-20}}&#60;/ref&#62;  Hostess attributes their initial popularity to Americans being released from the <a href="/Flour" title="Flour">flour</a> and <a href="/Sugar" title="Sugar">sugar</a> rationing during <a href="/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a>.&#60;ref name=snoball/&#62; Originally, the cakes were colored white and lacked the <a href="/Cr%C3%A8me" title="Crème">crème</a> filling.&#60;ref name=snoball/&#62; The crème filling was added in 1950.&#60;ref name=snoball/&#62;  A little later the pink coloring was added to the shredded coconut in one of the two cakes in each package, but eventually the company decided that it was more efficient to have both cakes the same color, and they decided to color both cakes in each package pink.&#60;ref name=snoball/&#62;</p>
<p>Other colors (sometimes with their own names) besides pink were sold at particular times of the year, including:&#60;ref name=snoball/&#62;</p>
