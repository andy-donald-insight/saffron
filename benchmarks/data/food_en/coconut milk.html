<p>
Traditionally, coconut milk is acquired through the grating of the white inner flesh of a brown coconut, mixing the resulting substance with a small amount of water to dissolve the fat present in the grated meat. The grating process itself can be carried out manually or with a more modern grating machine. Several grades of coconut milk exist: from <i>thick</i> at 20-22% fat to <i>thin</i> at 5-7%. Thick milk is prepared by directly squeezing grated coconut meat through <a href="/Cheesecloth" title="Cheesecloth">cheesecloth</a>. The squeezed coconut meat is then soaked in water and squeezed further to produce <i>thin</i> coconut milk. Thick milk is mainly used to make <a href="/Dessert" title="Dessert">desserts</a> as well as rich and dry <a href="/Sauce" title="Sauce">sauces</a>. Thin milk is used for <a href="/Soup" title="Soup">soups</a> and general cooking. This distinction is usually not made in <a href="/Western_World" title="Western World">Western nations</a> since fresh coconut milk is rare, and most consumers buy coconut milk in cans.</p>
<p><a href="/Coconut_water" title="Coconut water">Coconut water</a> is the watery liquid that usually comes from the young, still immature green coconut, although mature coconuts also have coconut water. The still jelly-like coconut meat is often added to coconut water to make a tropical drink.</p>
<p>Coconut milk can be made at home by processing grated coconut with hot water or milk, which extracts the oil and aromatic compounds. It has then a fat content of 17-24% depending on the fat level of the coconut meat and the quantity of added water. When refrigerated and left to set, coconut cream will rise to the top and separate out from the milk. To avoid this in commercial sold coconut milk, an <a href="/Emulsion#Emulsifiers" title="Emulsion">emulsifier</a> and a <a href="/Food_additive#Categories" title="Food additive">stabiliser</a> have to be used.</p>

<p>
Manufacturers of canned coconut milk typically combine thin and thick milk, with the addition of water as a filler. An official world standard can be found at Codex Alimentarius, <a class="external text" href="http://www.codexalimentarius.org/input/download/standards/10401/CXS_240e.pdf" rel="nofollow">STAN 240-2003</a>.</p>
<p>Depending on the brand and age of the milk itself, a thicker, more paste-like consistency floats to the top of the can, and is sometimes separated and used in <a href="/Recipe" title="Recipe">recipes</a> that require <a href="/Coconut_cream" title="Coconut cream">coconut cream</a> rather than coconut milk. Shaking the can prior to opening will even it out to a creamy thickness. Some brands sold in Western countries add <a href="/Thickening_agent" title="Thickening agent">thickening agents</a> and/or <a href="/Emulsifier" title="Emulsifier">emulsifiers</a> to prevent the milk from separating inside the can, since the separation tends to be misinterpreted as an indicator of spoilage by people unfamiliar with coconut milk.</p>
<p>Once opened, cans of coconut milk must be refrigerated&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.codexalimentarius.org/input/download/standards/10401/CXS_240e.pdfRefrigeration" rel="nofollow">codexalimentarius</a>&#60;/ref&#62; and are usually only good for a few days. If not, the milk can sour and spoil easily.</p>

Fresh coconut milk has a consistency and mildly sweet taste similar to that of cow&#39;s milk, and if properly prepared, should have little or no coconut odour.

<p>Coconut milk is an ingredient in some <a href="/Curry" title="Curry">curries</a>.

Coconut milk is the base of many Indonesian, Malaysian, Sri Lankan and <a href="/Thai_curry" title="Thai curry">Thai curries</a>. To make the curry sauce, the coconut milk is first cooked over fairly high heat to break down the milk and cream and allow the oil to separate.
