<p>The English word <i>cinnamon</i> and &#34;cassia&#34;, attested in English since the 15th century, derives from the <a href="/Ancient_Greek" title="Ancient Greek">Greek</a> κιννάμωμον <i>kinnámōmon</i> (later <i>kínnamon</i>), via <a href="/Latin_language" title="Latin language">Latin</a> and <a href="/Middle_French" title="Middle French">medieval French</a> intermediate forms. The Greek in turn was borrowed from a <a href="/Phoenician_language" title="Phoenician language">Phoenician</a> word, which would have been akin to the related <a href="/Hebrew_language" title="Hebrew language">Hebrew</a> <i>qinnamon</i>.&#60;ref name=&#34;oed&#34;&#62;{{cite OED2|cinnamon}}; also {{Etymonline|cinnamon}}.&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>The name of <i>cassia</i>, first recorded in English around 1000 AD, was borrowed via Latin and ultimately derives from Hebrew <i>q&#39;tsīʿāh</i>, a form of the verb <i>qātsaʿ</i> &#39;strip off bark&#39;.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite OED2|cassia}}; also {{Etymonline|cassia}}.&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p><a href="/Early_Modern_English" title="Early Modern English">Early Modern English</a> also used the name <i>canel</i> or <i>canella</i>, akin to the current names of cinnamon in several other European languages, which are derived from the Latin word <i>cannella</i>, a diminutive of <i>canna</i>, &#39;tube&#39;, from the way it curls up as it dries.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite OED2|canella; canel}}.&#60;/ref&#62;</p>

<p>In the classical times, four types of cinnamon were distinguished (and often confused):
</p>
<ul>
<li>Cassia (Hebrew קציעה <i>qəṣi`â</i>), the bark of <i><a href="/Cinnamomum_iners" title="Cinnamomum iners">Cinnamomum iners</a></i> from Arabia and <a href="/Ethiopia" title="Ethiopia">Ethiopia</a>, literally &#34;the peel of the plant&#34; which is scraped off the tree&#60;ref&#62;Klein, Ernest, <i>A Comprehensive Etymological Dictionary of the Hebrew Language for Readers of English</i>, <a href="/University_of_Haifa" title="University of Haifa">University of Haifa</a>, Carta, Jerusalem, p.589&#60;/ref&#62;</li>
<li><a href="/Cinnamomum_verum" title="Cinnamomum verum">True cinnamon</a> (Hebrew   קִנָּמוֹן <i>qinnamon</i>), the bark of <i>C. verum</i> (also called <i>C. zeylanicum</i>) from Sri Lanka</li>
<li><a href="/Malabathrum" title="Malabathrum">Malabathrum</a> or malobathrum (from <a href="/Sanskrit" title="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> तमालपत्रम्, <i> tamālapattram</i>, literally &#34;dark-tree leaves&#34;), several species including <i>C. tamala</i> from the north of India</li>
<li>Serichatum, <i>C. cassia</i> from <a href="/Seres" title="Seres">Seres</a>, that is, China</li>
</ul>

<p>Cinnamon has been known from remote antiquity. It was imported to <a href="/Egypt" title="Egypt">Egypt</a> as early as 2000 BC, but those who report it had come from China confuse it with cassia.&#60;ref&#62;&#34;The Indians obtained cassia from China&#34; (Toussaint-Samat 2009, p. 437).&#60;/ref&#62; Cinnamon was so highly prized among ancient nations that it was regarded as a gift fit for monarchs and even for a god: a fine inscription records the gift of cinnamon and cassia to the temple of <a href="/Apollo" title="Apollo">Apollo</a> at <a href="/Miletus" title="Miletus">Miletus</a>.&#60;ref&#62;Toussaint-Samat 2009, p. 437&#60;/ref&#62; Though its source was kept mysterious in the Mediterranean world for centuries by the middlemen who handled the <a href="/Spice_trade" title="Spice trade">spice trade</a>, to protect their monopoly as suppliers, cinnamon is native to <a href="/Bangladesh" title="Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a>, <a href="/Sri_Lanka" title="Sri Lanka">Sri Lanka</a>, the <a href="/Malabar_Coast" title="Malabar Coast">Malabar Coast</a> of India, and <a href="/Burma" title="Burma">Burma</a>.&#60;ref name=EB&#62;{{cite book |title=Encyclopaedia Britannica |year=2008 |chapter=Cinnamon |<a class="external text" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/">isbn </a>= 1-59339-292-3|quote=(species Cinnamomum zeylanicum), bushy evergreen tree of the laurel family (Lauraceae) native to Bangladesh, Sri Lanka (Ceylon), the neighboring Malabar Coast of India, and Myanmar (Burma), and also cultivated in South America and the West Indies for the spice consisting of its dried inner bark.}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>The first Greek reference to <i>kasia</i> is found in a poem by <a href="/Sappho" title="Sappho">Sappho</a> in the seventh century BC. According to <a href="/Herodotus" title="Herodotus">Herodotus</a>, both cinnamon and cassia grew in Arabia, together with incense, myrrh, and <a href="/Labdanum" title="Labdanum">ladanum</a>&#60;!--Do not change to &#34;laudanum&#34;; &#34;ladanum&#34; (an alternate spelling of &#34;labdanum,&#34; an aromatic resin) is correct.--&#62;, and were guarded by winged serpents. The <a href="/Phoenix_(mythology)" title="Phoenix (mythology)">phoenix</a> was reputed to build its nest from cinnamon and cassia. Herodotus mentions other writers who believed the source of cassia was the home of <a href="/Dionysos" title="Dionysos">Dionysos</a>, located somewhere east or south of Greece.</p>
<p>The Greeks used <i>kásia</i> or <i>malabathron</i> to flavour wine, together with absinth wormwood (<i><a href="/Artemisia_absinthium" title="Artemisia absinthium">Artemisia absinthium</a></i>). While <a href="/Theophrastus" title="Theophrastus">Theophrastus</a> gives a good account of the plants, he describes a curious method for harvesting: worms eat away the wood and leave the bark behind.</p>
<p>Egyptian recipes for <i>kyphi</i>, an aromatic used for burning, included cinnamon and cassia from <a href="/Ptolemaic_Kingdom" title="Ptolemaic Kingdom">Hellenistic times</a> onward. The gifts of Hellenistic rulers to temples sometimes included cassia and cinnamon as well as incense, <a href="/Myrrh" title="Myrrh">myrrh</a>, and Indian incense (<i>kostos</i>), so one might conclude that the Greeks used it for similar purposes.</p>
<p>The <a href="/Tanakh" title="Tanakh">Hebrew Bible</a> makes specific mention of the spice many times: first when <a href="/Moses" title="Moses">Moses</a> is commanded to use both sweet cinnamon (<a href="/Hebrew_language" title="Hebrew language">Hebrew</a>: קִנָּמוֹן, qinnāmôn) and cassia in the <a href="/Holy_anointing_oil" title="Holy anointing oil">holy anointing oil</a>;&#60;ref&#62;<a href="/Book_of_Exodus" title="Book of Exodus">Exodus</a> 30:22-25&#60;/ref&#62; in <a href="/Book_of_Proverbs" title="Book of Proverbs">Proverbs</a> where the lover&#39;s bed is perfumed with <a href="/Myrrh" title="Myrrh">myrrh</a>, <a href="/Agarwood" title="Agarwood">aloes</a>, and cinnamon;&#60;ref&#62;Proverbs 7:17&#60;/ref&#62; and in <a href="/Song_of_Solomon" title="Song of Solomon">Song of Solomon</a>, a song describing the beauty of his beloved, cinnamon scents her garments like &#34;the smell of Lebanon.&#34;&#60;ref&#62;Song of Solomon 4:11-14&#60;/ref&#62; Cassia was also part of the <i><a href="/Ketoret" title="Ketoret">ketoret</a></i>, the consecrated <a href="/Incense" title="Incense">incense</a> described in the <a href="/Hebrew_Bible" title="Hebrew Bible">Hebrew Bible</a> and <a href="/Talmud" title="Talmud">Talmud</a>. It was offered on the specialized incense altar in the time when the <a href="/Tabernacle" title="Tabernacle">Tabernacle</a> was located in the <a href="/Solomon&#39;s_Temple" title="Solomon&#39;s Temple">First</a> and <a href="/Second_Temple_period" title="Second Temple period">Second</a> Jerusalem temples. The <i>ketoret</i> was an important component of the temple service in <a href="/Jerusalem" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>. Psalm 45:8 mentions the garments of the king (or of <a href="/Torah" title="Torah">Torah</a> scholars) that smell of myrrh, <a href="/Agarwood" title="Agarwood">aloes</a>, and cassia.

<p>According to Pliny, a Roman pound ({{convert|327|g|oz}}) of cassia, cinnamon, or serichatum cost up to 300 <i>denarii</i>, the wage of ten months&#39; labour. <a href="/Diocletian" title="Diocletian">Diocletian</a>&#39;s <a href="/Edict_on_Maximum_Prices" title="Edict on Maximum Prices">Edict on Maximum Prices</a>&#60;ref&#62;ER Graser.

<p>Malabathrum leaves (<i>folia</i>) were used in cooking and for distilling an oil used in a caraway sauce for oysters by the Roman gourmet Gaius Gavius <a href="/Apicius" title="Apicius">Apicius</a>.&#60;ref&#62;<i>De re coquinaria</i>, I, 29, 30; IX, 7&#60;/ref&#62; Malabathrum is among the spices that, according to Apicius, any good kitchen should contain.</p>
<p>The famous Commagenum unguent produced in <a href="/Commagene" title="Commagene">Commagene</a>, in present-day eastern Turkey, was made from goose fat aromatised with cinnamon oil and <a href="/Spikenard" title="Spikenard">spikenard</a>. Malobathrum from Egypt (Dioscorides I, 63) was based on beef fat and contained cinnamon, as well; one pound cost 300 <i>denarii</i>. The Roman poet Martial (VI, 55) made fun of Romans who drip unguents, smell of cassia and cinnamon taken from a bird&#39;s nest, and look down on a man who does not smell at all.</p>
<p>Through the <a href="/Middle_Ages" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a>, the source of cinnamon was a mystery to the Western world. From reading Latin writers who quoted Herodotus, Europeans had learned that cinnamon came up the <a href="/Red_Sea" title="Red Sea">Red Sea</a> to the trading ports of Egypt, but where it came from was less than clear. When the <a href="/Sieur_de_Joinville" title="Sieur de Joinville">Sieur de Joinville</a> accompanied his king to Egypt on <a href="/The_crusades" title="The crusades">crusade</a> in 1248, he reported – and believed – what he had been told: that cinnamon was fished up in nets at the <a href="/Source_of_the_Nile" title="Source of the Nile">source of the Nile</a> out at the edge of the world (i.e., <a href="/Ethiopia" title="Ethiopia">Ethiopia</a>). <a href="/Marco_Polo" title="Marco Polo">Marco Polo</a> avoided precision on the topic.&#60;ref&#62;Toussaint-Samat 2009, p. 438 discusses cinnamon&#39;s hidden origins and Joinville&#39;s report.&#60;/ref&#62; Herodotus and other authors named Arabia as the source of cinnamon: they recounted that giant <a href="/Cinnamon_bird" title="Cinnamon bird">cinnamon birds</a> collected the cinnamon sticks from an unknown land where the cinnamon trees grew and used them to construct their nests, and that the Arabs employed a trick to obtain the sticks. <a href="/Pliny_the_Elder" title="Pliny the Elder">Pliny the Elder</a> wrote in the first century that traders had made this up to charge more, but the story remained current in <a href="/Byzantium" title="Byzantium">Byzantium</a> as late as 1310.</p>

<p>When Portuguese traders landed in Ceylon (Sri Lanka), they restructured the traditional production and management of cinnamon by the Sinhalese.

The British took control of Ceylon from the Dutch in 1796. However, the importance of the monopoly of Ceylon was already declining, as cultivation of the cinnamon tree spread to other areas, the more common cassia bark became more acceptable to consumers, and <a href="/Coffee" title="Coffee">coffee</a>, <a href="/Tea" title="Tea">tea</a>, <a href="/Sugar" title="Sugar">sugar</a>, and <a href="/Chocolate" title="Chocolate">chocolate</a> began to outstrip the popularity of traditional spices.</p>

<p>Aggregate annual production of cinnamon and cassia amounts to 27,500–35,000 tons, worldwide. Of this, <i>Cinnamomum verum</i> accounts for 7,500–10,000 tons of production, with the remainder produced by other species.&#60;ref name=fao93/&#62; <a href="/Sri_Lanka" title="Sri Lanka">Sri Lanka</a> produces 80–90% of the world&#39;s supply of <i>C. verum</i>, but that is the only species grown there; <i>C. verum</i> is also cultivated on a commercial scale in <a href="/Seychelles" title="Seychelles">Seychelles</a> and <a href="/Madagascar" title="Madagascar">Madagascar</a>.&#60;ref name=fao93/&#62; Global production of the other species averages 20,000–25,000 tons, of which Indonesia produces around two-thirds of the total, with significant production in <a href="/China" title="China">China</a>. <a href="/India" title="India">India</a> and <a href="/Vietnam" title="Vietnam">Vietnam</a> are also minor producers.&#60;ref name=fao93/&#62;</p>
<p>Cinnamon is cultivated by growing the tree for two years, then <a href="/Coppicing" title="Coppicing">coppicing</a> it, i.e., cutting the stems at ground level. The following year, about a dozen new shoots will form from the roots, replacing those that were cut. A number of pests such as <i>Colletotrichum gloeosporioides</i>, <i>Diplodia</i> spp., and  <i>Phytophthora cinnamomi</i> (stripe canker) can affect that growing plants, sometimes leading to death.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external free" href="https://www.plantvillage.com/en/topics/cinnamon/infos/diseases_and_pests_description_uses_propagation&#60;/ref&#38;gt" rel="nofollow">https://www.plantvillage.com/en/topics/cinnamon/infos/diseases_and_pests_description_uses_propagation&#60;/ref&#38;gt</a>;</p>
<p>The stems must be processed immediately after harvesting while the inner bark is still wet. The cut stems are processed by scraping off the outer bark, then beating the branch evenly with a hammer  to loosen the inner bark, which is then pried off in long rolls. Only {{convert|0.5|mm|2|abbr=on}} of the inner bark is used;{{citation needed|reason=the cassia in my pantry seems much thicker than that|date=August 2014}} the outer, woody portion is discarded, leaving metre-long cinnamon strips that curl into rolls (&#34;quills&#34;) on drying. The processed bark will dry completely in four to six hours, provided it is in a well-ventilated and relatively warm environment. Once dry, the bark is cut into 5- to 10-cm (2- to 4-in) lengths for sale. A less than ideal drying environment encourages the proliferation of pests in the bark, which may then require treatment by fumigation. Fumigated bark is not considered to be of the same premium quality as untreated bark.</p>
<p>Sri Lanka cinnamon has a very thin, smooth bark with a light-yellowish brown colour and a highly fragrant aroma. In recent years in Sri Lanka, mechanical devices have been developed to ensure premium quality and worker safety and health, following considerable research by the universities in that country, led by the <a href="/University_of_Ruhuna" title="University of Ruhuna">University of Ruhuna</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Grading">Grading</span></h3>
<p>{{See also|Food grading}}
The Sri Lankan grading system divides the cinnamon quills into four groups:</p>

<ul>
<li>Alba, less than {{convert|6|mm|abbr=on}} in diameter</li>
<li>Continental, less than {{convert|16|mm|abbr=on}} in diameter</li>
<li>Mexican, less than {{convert|19|mm|abbr=on}} in diameter</li>
<li>Hamburg, less than {{convert|32|mm|abbr=on}} in diameter</li>
</ul>

<p>These groups are further divided into specific grades. For example, Mexican is divided into M00 000 special, M000000, and M0000, depending on quill diameter and number of quills per kilogram.</p>
<p>Any pieces of bark less than {{convert|106|mm|abbr=on}} long are categorized as quillings. Featherings are the inner bark of twigs and twisted shoots. Chips are trimmings of quills, outer and inner bark that cannot be separated, or the bark of small twigs.</p>

<p>Cassia is the strong spicy flavour associated with cinnamon rolls and other such baked goods, as it handles baking conditions well. Chinese cinnamon is generally a medium to light reddish brown, hard and woody in texture, and thicker ({{convert|2|-|3|mm|abbr=on}} thick), as all of the layers of bark are used. Ceylon cinnamon, using only the thin inner bark, has a lighter brown colour, a finer, less dense and more crumbly texture, and is considered to be subtler and more aromatic in flavour than cassia, losing much of its flavour during cooking.</p>

<p>The barks, when whole, are easily distinguished, and their microscopic characteristics are also quite distinct. Ceylon cinnamon sticks (quills) have many thin layers and can easily be made into powder using a coffee or spice grinder, whereas cassia sticks are much harder. Indonesian cinnamon is often sold in neat quills made up of one thick layer, capable of damaging a spice or coffee grinder. Saigon cinnamon (<i>C. loureiroi</i>) and Chinese cinnamon (<i>C. cassia</i>) are always sold as broken pieces of thick bark, as the bark is not supple enough to be rolled into quills. The powdered bark is harder to distinguish, but if it is treated with <a href="/Tincture_of_iodine" title="Tincture of iodine">tincture of iodine</a> (a test for <a href="/Starch#Chemical_tests" title="Starch">starch</a>&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external free" href="http://www.webexhibits.org/causesofcolor/6AC.html&#60;/ref&#38;gt" rel="nofollow">http://www.webexhibits.org/causesofcolor/6AC.html&#60;/ref&#38;gt</a>;), little effect is visible with pure Ceylon cinnamon, but when Chinese cinnamon is present, a deep-blue tint is produced.&#60;ref name=&#34;bota_cassia&#34;&#62;{{cite web|title=Iodine test for cassia|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.botanical.com/botanical/mgmh/c/cassia31.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.botanical.com/botanical/mgmh/c/cassia31.html</a>}}&#60;/ref&#62;&#60;ref&#62;{{cite book |url=<a class="external free" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=IrXszQ77xhYC&#38;pg=PA390&#38;lpg=PA390&#38;dq=iodine+in+cassia&#38;source=bl&#38;ots=q3K18UCoQe&#38;sig=gkek4E0JaDWXrU4avEoh2NcY9zY&#38;hl=en&#38;ei=0oYXTv_JAcOCgAe6oOT2Dw&#38;sa=X&#38;oi=book_result&#38;ct=result&#38;resnum=5&#38;ved=0CDAQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&#38;q=iodine%20in%20cassia&#38;f=false" rel="nofollow">http://books.google.com/books?id=IrXszQ77xhYC&#38;pg=PA390&#38;lpg=PA390&#38;dq=iodine+in+cassia&#38;source=bl&#38;ots=q3K18UCoQe&#38;sig=gkek4E0JaDWXrU4avEoh2NcY9zY&#38;hl=en&#38;ei=0oYXTv_JAcOCgAe6oOT2Dw&#38;sa=X&#38;oi=book_result&#38;ct=result&#38;resnum=5&#38;ved=0CDAQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&#38;q=iodine%20in%20cassia&#38;f=false</a> |title=The Elements of materia medica and therapeutics |volume=2 |page=390 |first1=Jonathan |last1=Pereira |year=1854}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
