<p>The <b>pane ticinese</b> is a <a href="/White_bread" title="White bread">white bread</a> traditionally made in the <a href="/Swiss_canton" title="Swiss canton">Swiss canton</a> of <a href="/Ticino" title="Ticino">Ticino</a>, but also available in the rest of <a href="/Switzerland" title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>, where it is known as &#34;Bread of Ticino&#34; ({{lang-de|Tessinerbrot}}, {{lang-fr|pain tessinois}}). In Ticino, it is referred to by a number of names specific to the region, including <i>pane riga</i>, <i>reale</i> or <i>lireta</i>.&#60;ref name=kulinarischeserbe.ch&#62;{{kulinarischeserbe.ch|63|Pane ticinese}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>The bread is distinguishable by its shape—it is composed of several small loaves or rolls made to be broken off by hand—and by the addition of oil to the dough, which makes the bread particularly soft.&#60;ref name=&#34;kulinarischeserbe.ch&#34; /&#62;</p>

Up until the early 20th century, <i>pane ticinese</i> and other white breads were luxury foods that most <i>Ticinesi</i> could not afford; bread made from <a href="/Rye" title="Rye">rye</a> or <a href="/Chestnut" title="Chestnut">chestnut</a> flour was the usual fare in the Ticino mountain villages.&#60;ref name=&#34;kulinarischeserbe.ch&#34; /&#62;</p>
<p>The 1930s book <i>Atlas of Swiss Folklore</i> notes that the white bread made in the Ticino is distinguished from other breads by its <i>Reihenform</i>, or sequential form: it is composed of a number of small loaves attached to each other that are intended to be broken off by hand.&#60;ref name=&#34;kulinarischeserbe.ch&#34; /&#62; One of its names in a local dialect, <i>riia pan</i> (&#34;bread in a line&#34;) reflects this shape.&#60;ref name=&#34;kulinarischeserbe.ch&#34; /&#62; This shape of bread was originally brought to Ticino from <a href="/Italy" title="Italy">Italy</a>, where it has been known for a long time. A 1584 painting by the Italian artist <a href="/Annibale_Carracci" title="Annibale Carracci">Annibale Carracci</a> depicts a man eating at a table and, to his right, a bread very similar to <i>pane ticinese</i>.&#60;ref name=&#34;kulinarischeserbe.ch&#34; /&#62;</p>
<p>According to the <i>Atlas of Swiss Folklore</i>, the <i>Pane ticinese</i> of that time weighed 1 kilogram (2&#38;nbsp;lb) and was composed of eight loaves; it was sold whole or in parts (one half, a quarter, one eighth or one sixteenth), which were easily produced by breaking individual loaves off the bread.&#60;ref name=&#34;kulinarischeserbe.ch&#34; /&#62;</p>
<p>The bread was made popular in the rest of Switzerland in the 1950s by the Swiss Bakers&#39; Association, whose professional school at Richemont in Lucerne developed a range of specialty breads based on the baking traditions of each canton.&#60;ref name=&#34;kulinarischeserbe.ch&#34; /&#62;</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Preparation">Preparation</span></h2>
<p><i>Pane ticinese</i> is made of a dough of water, white flour, <i><a href="/Biga_(bread_baking)" title="Biga (bread baking)">biga</a></i> (a mixture of flour, yeast and water), salt, and (in the contemporary recipe only) some <a href="/Oil" title="Oil">oil</a>.&#60;ref name=&#34;kulinarischeserbe.ch&#34; /&#62; After being kneaded, the dough is divided into round pieces of about 2 kg, which are left to rise for a few minutes before being re-kneaded, flattened and formed into small individual loaves, or <i>michette</i> (plural of <i>michetta</i>).&#60;ref name=&#34;kulinarischeserbe.ch&#34; /&#62; Each <i>michetta</i> is shaped by hand into an oval shape of about 10&#38;nbsp;cm in length, and attached to other <i>michette</i> to form a complete loaf.</p>
<p>After being brushed with egg, the loaves are again allowed to rise until their volume has doubled, then baked for about 20 to 25 minutes at a temperature of {{convert|190|°C|°F}}, until the crust is a golden brown.&#60;ref name=&#34;kulinarischeserbe.ch&#34; /&#62;</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Use">Use</span></h2>
<p><i>Pane ticinese</i> is enjoyed as a bread for everyday use. Available in most Swiss bakeries and supermarkets, it is typically sold as a composite loaf of four to six pieces weighing 250 grams, with an overall length of 20 to 25 centimeters.&#60;ref name=&#34;kulinarischeserbe.ch&#34; /&#62; When stale, it is used in Ticino to make <i>torta leventinese</i>, a form of <a href="/Bread_pudding" title="Bread pudding">bread pudding</a>.&#60;ref name=&#34;kulinarischeserbe.ch&#34; /&#62;</p>
