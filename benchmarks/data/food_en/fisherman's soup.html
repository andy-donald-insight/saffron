<p>The dish is a famous soup, and often consumed by tourists and locals. An important ingredient in Fisherman&#39;s Soup&#60;ref&#62;Gundel&#39;s Hungarian Cookbook, Karoly Gundel, page22&#60;/ref&#62; is in the <a href="/Broth" title="Broth">court bouillon</a>, which adds significant flavor. To prepare the soup base, fish trimmings are used, fresh carp heads, bones, skin and fins. These are boiled with water, salt and vegetables (red onions, green peppers and tomatoes) for two hours. When ready, the court bouillon is strained. Hot ground paprika and two finger-thick carp fillets, the roe and  coral is added, ten minutes before serving, to the boiling soup.</p>

<ul>
<li><i>Fisherman&#39;s Soup a la <a href="/Baja%2C_Hungary" title="Baja, Hungary">Baja</a></i>. According to traditional recipes 6.5 pound (3&#38;nbsp;kg) fish is added and approximately 75% is carp. It&#39;s served with homemade soup pasta called <i>gyufatészta</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Traditionally, the soup is prepared in small <a href="/Kettle" title="Kettle">kettles</a> on open fire on the river banks by fishermen. Fisherman&#39;s soup in kettle is prepared with fresh fish on the place. When prepared in kettles, first, chopped <a href="/Onion" title="Onion">onion</a> is fried in the kettle with some oil until it is caramelized. Then, ground <i><a href="/Paprika" title="Paprika">paprika</a></i> is added and the kettle is filled with water. When the water comes to a boil, other spices (such as <a href="/Black_pepper" title="Black pepper">black pepper</a>, white wine, <a href="/Tomato" title="Tomato">tomato</a> juice) are added, and finally the fish, chopped into large pieces. Entire fish, including heads and tails, are often  added to the soup. The  soup is usually prepared with mixed fish, the most common species are <a href="/Common_carp" title="Common carp">common carp</a>, <a href="/Catfish" title="Catfish">catfish</a>, <a href="/Perch" title="Perch">perch</a> and <a href="/Northern_pike" title="Northern pike">pike</a>. Depending on the amount of added hot paprika the soup is mildly to very hot. The Hungarian soup is famous for being very hot and spicy.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.nestle.hu/maggi/recipes/recipe.aspx?id=831" rel="nofollow">Magyaros csipös halászlé</a>&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>The soup is poured directly from the kettle into the plates and eaten with bread (the spicier the soup, the more bread is required).</p>
<p>Many people, especially fishermen, regard the preparation of fish soup as somewhat secretive. Although the recipe is basically simple, the &#34;right&#34; ratio of <a href="/Spice" title="Spice">spices</a>, onion, fish (its quality and variety) and water, as well as timing, affect the soup taste significantly. Many dedicated fishermen regarded their recipe as a highly-kept secret.</p>
<p>Competitions in preparing the soup are popular and are usually held at <a href="/Fair" title="Fair">fairs</a> or <a href="/Picnic" title="Picnic">picnics</a> along river coast. Visitors are offered to taste the soup for money or for free; the quality is determined by public or <a href="/Committee" title="Committee">committee</a> and (un)success of competitors is often subject of mutual <a href="/Teasing" title="Teasing">teasing</a>.</p>
<p>The soup is best accompanied by dry white wine (such as <a href="/Riesling" title="Riesling">Riesling</a>), which may be diluted with <a href="/Carbonated_water" title="Carbonated water">soda water</a>. The combination of wine and soda water (a wine <a href="/Spritzer" title="Spritzer">spritzer</a>) is called <i><a href="/Spritzer" title="Spritzer">fröccs</a></i> in Hungarian or <i>špricer</i> in Serbian and Croatian from the German word <i>spritz</i>, which imitates the sound made by soda water as it fizzes out of the dispenser.</p>
<p>The Fisherman&#39;s soup or halászlé is a traditional dish for Christmas Eve dinner in Hungary. </p>
