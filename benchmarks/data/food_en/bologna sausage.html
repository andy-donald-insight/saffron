<p>Sometimes referred to as garlic bologna, this sausage differs from traditional bologna due to various seasonings, most typically <a href="/Garlic" title="Garlic">garlic</a> being added to the recipe. Although referred to as German bologna elsewhere, it is usually called <i>Fleischwurst</i> in <a href="/Germany" title="Germany">Germany</a> and <i><a href="/Extrawurst" title="Extrawurst">Extrawurst</a></i> in <a href="/Austria" title="Austria">Austria</a>.  Other varieties, such as the French variation, are sometimes called <i>saucisse de Lyon</i> which the Swiss call <i>Lyoner </i>or <i>Lyonerwurst</i> (&#34;<a href="/Lyon" title="Lyon">Lyon</a> sausage&#34;) and usually do not contain a noticeable amount of garlic, while <i>Fleischwurst</i> is often flavored with garlic, these varieties are generally an off-white color, as they do not contain nitrites (which give cooked pork its pink color). </p>
<p>In Australia, garlic bologna is widely referred to as Berliner and labeled as Berliner Fleischwurst by various local &#39;small goods&#39; manufacturers.   </p>
<p>In Germany, &#34;regular&#34; bologna is sometimes referred to as <i>Mortadella</i>, and is mostly identical and made out of the same meats as its American counterpart, although it often contains <a href="/Pistachio" title="Pistachio">pistachios</a>. The original, larger, and less finely ground <i>Mortadella</i> is then called <i>italienische Mortadella</i>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Pariser_.28parizer.29">Pariser (parizer)</span></h2>
<p>In various countries in Central and Eastern Europe, many sausages are made from very finely ground meat, usually poultry, pork, or beef. They differ from local <i>Mortadella</i>-labeled sausages (which, in contrast, are very similar to Italian original) by being dominantly seasoned with garlic, rather than myrtle, and by not containing pieces of fat/bacon, pistacchio, or olives. They are known by the common name <i>Pariser/Parizer</i> (intended meaning being Parisian sausage) or special salami. The etymology of former name is unknown, but it is assumed to stem from some German name for French or Lyonese sausage, whereas the latter is usually a local translation of Austrian name <i>Extrawurst</i>. Various local brand names are also variants the British name for the sausage, Polony, such as Slovenian <i>Poli</i> or Croatian <i>Poliko</i>.</p>
