Coconut oil can be extracted through &#34;dry&#34; or &#34;wet&#34; processing.

<p>Proper harvesting of the coconut (the age of a coconut can be 2 to 20 months when picked) makes a significant difference in the efficacy of the oil-making process.

<p>Virgin coconut oil (VCO) can be produced from fresh <a href="/Coconut_milk" title="Coconut milk">coconut milk</a>, meat, or residue. Producing it from the fresh meat involves removing the shell and washing, then either wet-milling or drying the residue, and using a <a href="/Screw_press" title="Screw press">screw press</a> to extract the oil. VCO can also be extracted from fresh meat by grating and drying it to a moisture content of 10–12%, then using a manual press to extract the oil. Producing it from <a href="/Coconut_milk" title="Coconut milk">coconut milk</a> involves grating the coconut and mixing it with water, then squeezing out the oil. The milk can also be fermented for 36–48 hours, the oil removed, and the cream heated to remove any remaining oil.

<p>This &#34;crude&#34; coconut oil is not suitable for consumption because it contains contaminants and must be refined with further heating and filtering.</p>
<p>Another method for extraction of a &#34;high-quality&#34; coconut oil involves the enzymatic action of alpha-amylase, polygalacturonases, and proteases on diluted coconut paste.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite journal |author=McGlone OC, Canales A, Carter JV |title=Coconut oil extraction by a new enzymatic process |journal=J Food Sci |volume=51 |pages=695–697 |year=1986 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2621.1986.tb13914.x |issue=3}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>Unlike virgin coconut oil, refined coconut oil has no coconut taste or aroma. RBD oil is used for home cooking, commercial food processing, and cosmetic, industrial, and pharmaceutical purposes.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Hydrogenation">Hydrogenation</span></h3>
<p>RBD coconut oil can be processed further into partially or fully hydrogenated oil to increase its melting point. Since virgin and RBD coconut oils melt at 24&#38;nbsp;°C (76&#38;nbsp;°F), foods containing coconut oil tend to melt in warm climates. A higher melting point is desirable in these warm climates, so the oil is <a href="/Hydrogenated" title="Hydrogenated">hydrogenated</a>. The melting point of hydrogenated coconut oil is 36–40&#38;nbsp;°C (97–104&#38;nbsp;°F).</p>
<p>In the process of hydrogenation, unsaturated fats (monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids) are combined with hydrogen in a catalytic process to make them more saturated. Coconut oil contains only 6% monounsaturated and 2% polyunsaturated fatty acids. In the partial hydrogenation process, some of these are transformed into <a href="/Trans_fatty_acids" title="Trans fatty acids">trans fatty acids</a>.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite journal|author=Foster, R., Williamson, C.S. and Lunn, J. |doi=10.1111/j.1467-3010.2008.01738.x|title=BRIEFING PAPER: Culinary Oils And Their Health Effects|journal=Nutrition Bulletin|volume= 34|issue=1 |year=2009|pages= 4–47}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
