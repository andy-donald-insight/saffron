<p><b>Magiritsa</b> ({{Lang-el|μαγειρίτσα}}) is a <a href="/Greek_cuisine" title="Greek cuisine">Greek</a> <a href="/Soup" title="Soup">soup</a> made from <a href="/Domestic_sheep" title="Domestic sheep">lamb</a> offal, associated  with the <a href="/Easter" title="Easter">Easter</a> (Pascha) tradition of the <a href="/Eastern_Orthodox_Church" title="Eastern Orthodox Church">Greek Orthodox Church</a>. Accordingly, Greek-Americans and Greek-Canadians sometimes call it &#34;Easter soup&#34;, &#34;Easter Sunday soup&#34;, or &#34;Easter lamb soup&#34;. In some parts of Greece, most notably <a href="/Thessaly" title="Thessaly">Thessaly</a>, it is not served as soup but rather as a <a href="/Fricassee" title="Fricassee">fricassee</a>, where it contains only offal and large variety of vegetables, but no onions or rice, as in the soup.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Traditional_use">Traditional use</span></h2>
<p>Magiritsa is eaten to break the <a href="/Fasting" title="Fasting">fast</a> of the <a href="/Eastern_Orthodox_Church" title="Eastern Orthodox Church">Greek Orthodox</a> <a href="/Great_Lent" title="Great Lent">Great Lent</a>, the 40 days before Easter. Its role and ingredients result from its association with the roasted lamb traditionally served at the Paschal meal; in its traditional form, magiritsa simply consists of all the offal removed from the lamb before roasting, and subsequently flavored with seasonings and sauces. Prepared by <a href="/Greece" title="Greece">Greeks</a> on <a href="/Holy_Saturday" title="Holy Saturday">Holy Saturday</a> along with the next day&#39;s lamb, magiritsa is consumed immediately after the Pascha midnight Divine Liturgy. The dish is particularly thick and filling, making it a satisfying meal for breaking the fast.</p>

<p>While traditional magiritsa includes all the lamb offal available, it is the <a href="/Head" title="Head">head</a> and <a href="/Neck" title="Neck">neck</a> of the lamb which provide most of the soup&#39;s flavor, and those parts, along with the <a href="/Intestines" title="Intestines">intestines</a>, <a href="/Heart" title="Heart">heart</a>, and <a href="/Liver" title="Liver">liver</a>, are most commonly used today.</p>
<p>After a thorough cleaning, the lamb parts are boiled whole in water for between thirty minutes and two hours, then cut up into smaller pieces, flavored with <a href="/Onions" title="Onions">onions</a>, <a href="/Dill" title="Dill">dill</a>, <a href="/Butter" title="Butter">butter</a> and sometimes <a href="/Vegetables" title="Vegetables">vegetables</a>, and left to <a href="/Simmer" title="Simmer">simmer</a>. <a href="/Rice" title="Rice">Rice</a> is added towards the end of the boiling process, and the stock is thickened with <a href="/Avgolemono" title="Avgolemono">avgolemono</a>.</p>
<p>When consumed the wee hours of the Paschal morning after church, magiritsa is sometimes accompanied by <a href="/Salad" title="Salad">salad</a> and <a href="/Cheese" title="Cheese">cheese</a>, <a href="/Tsoureki" title="Tsoureki">tsoureki</a> sweet bread, and hard-boiled <a href="/Egg_(food)" title="Egg (food)">eggs</a> dyed red as a symbol of the <a href="/Resurrection_of_Jesus" title="Resurrection of Jesus">risen Christ</a>&#39;s blood.</p>
