In 1767, <a href="/Joseph_Priestley" title="Joseph Priestley">Joseph Priestley</a> discovered a method of infusing water with carbon dioxide when he suspended a bowl of water above a beer vat at a local brewery in <a href="/Leeds" title="Leeds">Leeds</a>, England.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|url=<a class="external free" href="http://inventors.about.com/od/pstartinventors/a/JosephPriestley.htm" rel="nofollow">http://inventors.about.com/od/pstartinventors/a/JosephPriestley.htm</a> |title=Joseph Priestley&#38;nbsp;— Discovery of Oxygen&#38;nbsp;— Invention of Soda Water by Joseph Priestley |publisher=Inventors.about.com |date=2009-09-16 |accessdate=2009-09-23}}&#60;/ref&#62; The air blanketing the fermenting beer—called &#39;fixed air&#39;—was known to kill mice suspended in it. Priestley found water thus treated had a pleasant taste, and he offered it to friends as a cool, refreshing drink.  In 1772, Priestley published a paper titled <i>Impregnating Water with Fixed Air</i> in which he describes dripping &#34;oil of vitriol&#34; (<a href="/Sulfuric_acid" title="Sulfuric acid">sulfuric acid</a>) onto <a href="/Chalk" title="Chalk">chalk</a> to produce carbon dioxide gas, and encouraging the gas to dissolve into an agitated bowl of water.&#60;ref name=&#34;Priestly&#34;&#62;{{cite web|url=<a class="external free" href="http://dbhs.wvusd.k12.ca.us/webdocs/Chem-History/Priestley-1772/Priestley-1772-11.html" rel="nofollow">http://dbhs.wvusd.k12.ca.us/webdocs/Chem-History/Priestley-1772/Priestley-1772-11.html</a>|title=Impregnating Water with Fixed Air, Page 7|accessdate=2008-08-07|first=Joseph |last=Priestly|year=1772|archive-url=<a class="external free" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081221221507/http://dbhs.wvusd.k12.ca.us/webdocs/Chem-History/Priestley-1772/Priestley-1772-11.html" rel="nofollow">https://web.archive.org/web/20081221221507/http://dbhs.wvusd.k12.ca.us/webdocs/Chem-History/Priestley-1772/Priestley-1772-11.html</a>|archive-date=21 December 2008}}&#60;/ref&#62; Priestley referred to his invention of soda water as being his &#34;happiest&#34; discovery.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/03/books/03gewen.html?_r=0" rel="nofollow">&#34;The Man Who Discovered Oxygen (Maybe) and Gave the World Soda Water&#34;</a>.

<p>Modern carbonated water is made by passing pressurized carbon dioxide through water.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Etymology">Etymology</span></h3>
<p>In the United States, carbonated water was known as <i>soda water</i> until World War II, due to the sodium salts it contained. These were added as flavoring and acidity regulators with the intent of mimicking the taste of natural <a href="/Mineral_water" title="Mineral water">mineral water</a>. During the <a href="/Great_Depression" title="Great Depression">Great Depression</a>, it was sometimes called &#34;two cents plain&#34;, a reference to its being the cheapest drink at <a href="/Soda_fountain" title="Soda fountain">soda fountains</a> (i.e. without the addition of three cents-worth of flavored syrup).</p>
<p>In the 1950s, terms such as <i>sparkling water</i> and <i>seltzer water</i> gained favor. The term <i>seltzer water</i> is a <a href="/Genericized_trademark" title="Genericized trademark">genericized trademark</a> that derives from the German town <a href="/Selters_(Taunus)" title="Selters (Taunus)">Selters</a>, which is renowned for its <a href="/Mineral_springs" title="Mineral springs">mineral springs</a>.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web |url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&#38;va=seltzer" rel="nofollow">http://www.merriam-webster.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&#38;va=seltzer</a> |title=Definition of seltzer&#38;nbsp;— Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |accessdate=2007-11-07 |work=}}&#60;/ref&#62; Naturally carbonated water, <i><a href="/Selters" title="Selters">Selters</a></i>, has been commercially bottled and shipped from this town since the 18th century or earlier.  Generally, <i>seltzer water</i> has no added sodium salts, while <i>club soda</i> still retains some of the sodium salts that once were used. The term &#34;Seltzer water&#34; is virtually unknown in Britain and most Commonwealth countries, although Australians of a certain age remember Selza Saline powder in metal tins with lids which had to be opened for each use with the back of a spoon, sold during the 1950s.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web |url=<a class="external free" href="http://origin.forums.vogue.com.au/showthread.php?t=187343&#38;page=2" rel="nofollow">http://origin.forums.vogue.com.au/showthread.php?t=187343&#38;page=2</a> |title=Lemon Saline Powder - Remember That?  |accessdate=2013-08-04 |work=}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>

Carbonated water changed the way people drank. Instead of drinking liquor straight/neat (without a mixer), soda water and carbonated soft drinks helped dilute alcohol, and made having a drink more socially acceptable. Whisky and sodas can be seen in many British TV series and films from the 1960s and earlier and the soda siphon is ubiquitous in many movies made before 1970. Only a small amount of soda water is added; a &#39;splash&#39;, and  &#39;Scotch and a splash&#39; was a common bar order. Whisky and soda was commonly drunk without ice in the UK. </p>
<p>Social drinking changed with the counter-culture movement of the 1970s and the arrival of new bottled and canned beverages in the 1980s, and soda water has declined in popularity. Soda siphons are still bought by the more traditional bar trade and are available at the bar in many upmarket establishments, but in the UK there are now only two wholesalers of soda-water in traditional glass siphons, and an estimated market of around 120,000 siphons per year (2009). Worldwide, preferences are for beverages in recyclable plastic containers.</p>
<p>Home soda siphons and soda water are enjoying a renaissance in the 21st century as <a href="/Retro" title="Retro">retro</a> items become fashionable. Contemporary soda siphons are commonly made of <a href="/Aluminum" title="Aluminum">aluminum</a>, although <a href="/Glass" title="Glass">glass</a> and <a href="/Stainless_steel" title="Stainless steel">stainless steel</a> siphons are available. The valve-heads of today are made of plastic, with metal valves, and replaceable <a href="/O-ring" title="O-ring">o-ring</a> seals. Older siphons are in demand on on-line auction sites. Carbonated water, without the acidity regulating addition of soda, is currently seen as fashionable although home production (see above) is mainly eschewed in favor of commercial products.</p>

<p>The gas pressure in a siphon drives soda water up through a tube inside the siphon when a valve lever at the top is depressed. Commercial soda siphons came pre-charged with water and gas, and were returned to the retailer for exchange when empty. A deposit scheme ensured they were not otherwise thrown away. Home soda siphons were/are pressurised with a small disposable steel bulb containing carbon dioxide, the bulb is pressed into the valve assembly at the top of the siphon, the gas injected, then the bulb is withdrawn. </p>

One <a href="/Etymology" title="Etymology">etymology</a> of the term <i><a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/codswallop">codswallop</a></i> originates from beer sold in Codd bottles, though this is generally dismissed as a <a href="/Folk_etymology" title="Folk etymology">folk etymology</a>.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/235250.html" rel="nofollow">UK word origins</a>&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>The bottles were regularly produced for many decades, but gradually declined in usage. Since children smashed the bottles to retrieve the marbles, they are relatively rare and have become <a href="/Collector_item" title="Collector item">collector items</a>, particularly in the UK.  They could be found at retail shops and restaurants in many parts of the world until recently.  Due to the risk of explosion and injuries from fragmented glass pieces, use of this type of bottle is no longer encouraged in most countries.

<p>Devices known as soda makers, or soda carbonators, are either made of bought carbonating systems based on larger, refillable carbon dioxide canisters rather than small, disposable cartridges good for only one liter which might be expensive for long-term use. Soda makers reach the &#34;gassy&#34;, fully carbonated level of commercial waters, for at-home enthusiasts. Detailed and simple plans to build small in-home carbonating systems for under $100 in parts are freely available on the internet and can produce a liter of carbonated water for less than 2 US cents.&#60;ref name=mineral&#62;{{cite web|url=<a class="external free" href="http://milwaukeemakerspace.org/2011/09/carbonated-water/" rel="nofollow">http://milwaukeemakerspace.org/2011/09/carbonated-water/</a>|title=Making Carbonated Mineral Water|date=2011-09-26|work=Milwaukee Makerspace}}&#60;/ref&#62;&#60;ref name=instr&#62;{{cite web|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.instructables.com/id/DIY-Soda-Water-%26-Home-Carbonation---Pays-For-Itsel/" rel="nofollow">http://www.instructables.com/id/DIY-Soda-Water-%26-Home-Carbonation---Pays-For-Itsel/</a>|title=Home Carbonation System|date=2007-07-15|work=Instructibles}}&#60;/ref&#62; This is despite the higher cost related to the manufacturer-specific returnable pressurized carbon dioxide canisters (around 400 to 800 grams, enough for 40 to 80 liters of carbonated water).

<p>Carbonated water can be made at home by use of a readily available {{convert|1|L|USqt|abbr=on}} soda siphon (<a href="/Seltzer_bottle" title="Seltzer bottle">seltzer bottle</a>), recharged with disposable carbon dioxide cartridges. One recipe is to chill filtered tap water in the fridge, optionally add one quarter to one half a level teaspoon of sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) to the soda siphon, add the chilled water and add the carbon dioxide under pressure. A pH testing kit can be used to gauge the amount of sodium bicarbonate used to achieve the desired acidity. The siphon should be kept in the refrigerator to preserve carbonation of the contents. Many soda siphons are decorative in nature and are kept out for viewing on the drinks tray. Soda water made in this way tends not to be as &#39;gassy&#39; as commercial soda water because water from the refrigerator is not chilled as much as possible, and the pressure of carbon dioxide is limited to that available from the cartridge rather than being at a higher pressure created by pumps in a commercial carbonation plant.</p>

The process of dissolving carbon dioxide in water is called <a href="/Carbonation" title="Carbonation">carbonation</a>. Commercial soda water in siphons is made by chilling filtered plain water to {{convert|8|C}} or below, optionally adding a <a href="/Sodium" title="Sodium">sodium</a> or <a href="/Potassium" title="Potassium">potassium</a> based alkaline compound such as <a href="/Sodium_bicarbonate" title="Sodium bicarbonate">sodium bicarbonate</a> to reduce acidity, and then pressurizing the water with carbon dioxide. The gas dissolves in the water, and a top-off fill of carbon dioxide is added to pressurize the siphon to approximately {{convert|120|psi}}, some {{convert|30|to-|40|psi|abbr=on}} higher than is present in fermenting <a href="/Champagne_(wine)" title="Champagne (wine)">champagne</a> bottles.</p>
<p>In many modern <a href="/Restaurant" title="Restaurant">restaurants</a> and <a href="/Drinking_establishment" title="Drinking establishment">drinking establishments</a>, soda water is manufactured on-site using devices known as carbonators. Carbonators use mechanical pumps to pump water into a pressurized chamber where it is combined with {{chem|CO|2}} from pressurized tanks at approximately {{convert|100|psi|abbr=on}}. The pressurized, carbonated water then flows to taps or to mixing heads where it is mixed with flavorings as it is dispensed.</p>

<p>Carbonated water is increasingly popular in cooking to provide a lighter texture to doughs and batters as compared to regular water. Kevin Ryan, a food scientist at the University of Illinois at Urbana, says the effervescent bubbles when mixed with dough provide the light texture. Pockets of air are introduced into the dough and further expand when cooking.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|last1=Rentschler|first1=Kay|title=Sparkling water lightens foods|url=<a class="external free" href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2003-01-08/entertainment/0301080031_1_dough-sparkling-carbon-dioxide" rel="nofollow">http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2003-01-08/entertainment/0301080031_1_dough-sparkling-carbon-dioxide</a>|website=Chicago Tribune|publisher=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=27 December 2014}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
