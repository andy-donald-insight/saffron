<p>Other accounts attribute the discovery of coffee to Sheikh Omar. According to the ancient chronicle (preserved in the Abd-Al-Kadir manuscript), Omar, who was known for his ability to cure the sick through prayer, was once exiled from <a href="/Mocha%2C_Yemen" title="Mocha, Yemen">Mocha</a>, <a href="/Yemen" title="Yemen">Yemen</a> to a desert cave near Ousab. Starving, Omar chewed berries from nearby shrubbery, but found them to be bitter. He tried roasting the seeds to improve the flavor, but they became hard. He then tried boiling them to soften the seed, which resulted in a fragrant brown liquid. Upon drinking the liquid Omar was revitalized and sustained for days. As stories of this &#34;miracle drug&#34; reached Mocha, Omar was asked to return and was made a saint.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite book|last=Ukers|first=William|title=All About Coffee|year=1935|publisher=Tea &#38; Coffee Trade Journal Company|location=New York|pages=9–10}}&#60;/ref&#62; From Ethiopia, the coffee plant was introduced into the Arab World through Egypt and Yemen.&#60;ref name=&#34;Souza120&#34;&#62;{{harvnb|Souza|2008|p=3}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>

This method loses about 50% of the seeds&#39; potential, as about half fail to sprout.

<p>The 2-mm-long <a href="/Coffee_borer_beetle" title="Coffee borer beetle">coffee borer beetle</a> (<i>Hypothenemus hampei</i>) is the most damaging insect pest to the world’s coffee industry, destroying up to 50 percent or more of the coffee berries on plantations in most coffee-producing countries. The adult female beetle nibbles a single tiny hole in a coffee berry and lays 35 to 50 eggs. Inside, the offspring grow, mate, and then emerge from the commercially ruined berry to disperse, repeating the cycle. Pesticides are mostly ineffective because the beetle juveniles are protected inside the berry nurseries, but they are vulnerable to predation by birds when they emerge. When groves of trees are nearby, the <a href="/American_yellow_warbler" title="American yellow warbler">American yellow warbler</a>, <a href="/Rufous-capped_warbler" title="Rufous-capped warbler">rufous-capped warbler</a>, and other insectivorous birds have been shown to reduce by 50 percent the number of coffee berry borers in Costa Rica coffee plantations.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web |url= <a class="external free" href="http://birdsnews.com/2013/insect-eating-birds-reduce-worst-coffee-plantation-pest-50-percent" rel="nofollow">http://birdsnews.com/2013/insect-eating-birds-reduce-worst-coffee-plantation-pest-50-percent</a> |title= Insect-eating birds reduce worst coffee plantation pest by 50 percent |publisher= birdsnews.com |date= September 5, 2013 |accessdate= September 20, 2013}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Processing">Processing</span></h3>
<p>{{See also|Coffee production}}</p>
<p>Coffee berries and their seeds undergo several processes before they become the familiar roasted coffee. Berries have been traditionally selectively picked by hand; a labor-intensive method, it involves the selection of only the berries at the peak of ripeness. More commonly, crops are strip picked, where all berries are harvested simultaneously regardless of ripeness by person or machine. After picking, green coffee is processed by one of two methods—the dry process method, simpler and less labor-intensive as the berries can be strip picked, and the wet process method, which incorporates fermentation into the process and yields a mild coffee.&#60;ref&#62;Vincent, J.-C. in <a href="#CM">Clarke &#38; Macrae</a>, p. 1.&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>Then they are sorted by ripeness and color and most often the <a href="/Fruiting" title="Fruiting">flesh</a> of the berry is removed, usually by machine, and the seeds are fermented to remove the slimy layer of <a href="/Mucilage" title="Mucilage">mucilage</a> still present on the seed. When the <a href="/Fermentation_(food)" title="Fermentation (food)">fermentation</a> is finished, the seeds are washed with large quantities of <a href="/Fresh_water" title="Fresh water">fresh water</a> to remove the fermentation residue, which generates massive amounts of <a href="/Coffee_wastewater" title="Coffee wastewater">coffee wastewater</a>. Finally, the seeds are dried.&#60;ref name=&#34;kummer2003p38&#34;&#62;{{harvnb |Kummer|2003|page=38}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>The best (but least used) method of drying coffee is using drying tables. In this method, the pulped and fermented coffee is spread thinly on raised beds, which allows the air to pass on all sides of the coffee, and then the coffee is mixed by hand. In this method the drying that takes place is more uniform, and fermentation is less likely. Most African coffee is dried in this manner and certain coffee farms around the world are starting to use this traditional method.&#60;ref name=&#34;kummer2003p38&#34;/&#62;</p>
<p>Next, the coffee is sorted, and labeled as green coffee. Another way to let the coffee seeds dry is to let them sit on a concrete patio and rake over them in the sunlight. Some companies use cylinders to pump in heated air to dry the coffee seeds, though this is generally in places where the humidity is very high.&#60;ref name=&#34;kummer2003p38&#34;/&#62;</p>

<p>{{See also|Coffee roasting}}</p>
<p>The next step in the process is the roasting of the green coffee. Coffee is usually sold in a roasted state, and with rare exceptions all coffee is roasted before it is consumed.

The bean decreases in weight as moisture is lost and increases in volume, causing it to become less dense. The density of the bean also influences the strength of the coffee and requirements for packaging.</p>
<p>The actual roasting begins when the temperature inside the bean reaches approximately {{convert|200|°C|°F}}, though different varieties of seeds differ in moisture and density and therefore roast at different rates.&#60;ref name=&#34;trent&#34; /&#62; During roasting, <a href="/Caramelization" title="Caramelization">caramelization</a> occurs as intense heat breaks down <a href="/Starch" title="Starch">starches</a>, changing them to <a href="/Simple_sugar" title="Simple sugar">simple sugars</a> that begin to brown, which alters the color of the bean.&#60;ref name=&#34;kummer2003p261&#34;&#62;{{harvnb |Kummer|2003|page=261}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>

<p>Depending on the color of the roasted beans as perceived by the human eye, they will be labeled as light, medium light, medium, medium dark, dark, or very dark. A more accurate method of discerning the degree of roast involves measuring the reflected light from roasted seeds illuminated with a light source in the near-<a href="/Infrared" title="Infrared">infrared</a> spectrum. This elaborate light meter uses a process known as <a href="/Spectroscopy" title="Spectroscopy">spectroscopy</a> to return a number that consistently indicates the roasted coffee&#39;s relative degree of roast or flavor development.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Roast_characteristics">Roast characteristics</span></h4>

<p>The degree of roast has an effect upon coffee flavor and body. Darker roasts are generally bolder because they have less fiber content and a more sugary flavor.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Brewing">Brewing</span></h3>
<p>{{See also|Coffee preparation}}</p>
<p>Coffee beans must be ground and <a href="/Drip_brew" title="Drip brew">brewed</a> to create a beverage. The criteria for choosing a method include flavor and economy. Almost all methods of preparing coffee require that the beans be ground and then mixed with hot water long enough to allow the flavor to emerge but not so long as to draw out bitter compounds.

<p>The roasted coffee beans may be ground at a roastery, in a grocery store, or in the home. Most coffee is roasted and ground at a roastery and sold in packaged form, though roasted coffee beans can be ground at home immediately before consumption. It is also possible, though uncommon, to roast raw beans at home.</p>
<p>The choice of brewing method depends to some extent on the degree to which the coffee beans have been roasted. Lighter roasted coffee tends to be used for filter coffee as the combination of method and roast style results in higher acidity, complexity, and clearer nuances{{clarify|date=February 2014}}&#60;!--&#34;Clearer nuances&#34; needs to be explained for the non-expert or deleted.--&#62;. Darker roasted coffee is used for espresso because the machine naturally extracts more dissolved solids, causing lighter coffee to become too acidic.</p>
<p>Coffee beans may be ground in several ways. A <a href="/Burr_grinder" title="Burr grinder">burr grinder</a> uses revolving elements to shear the seed; a <a href="/Blade_grinder" title="Blade grinder">blade grinder</a> cuts the seeds with blades moving at high speed; and a mortar and pestle crushes the seeds. For most brewing methods a burr grinder is deemed superior because the grind is more even and the grind size can be adjusted.</p>
