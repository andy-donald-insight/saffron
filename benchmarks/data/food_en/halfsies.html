It was the result of the so-called &#34;sugar backlash&#34; in which the amount of sugar in children&#39;s breakfast cereals became an issue.  The premise was it contained half the sugar of regular breakfast cereals, and that it was half-corn and half-rice.  The cereal <a href="/Nuggets" title="Nuggets">nuggets</a> were shaped as half a normal cereal ring, like the letter C.</p>

<p>The marketing campaign was headed by the King of The Land of Half who presided over The Land of Half.  The box featured Half Land where houses, cars, food, etc. were all cut in half (i.e. only half of a house would be present with the walls open on one half and you could see into the house, etc.)</p>

Characters included the King of the Land of Half, his sons Half Prince and Half Pint, Count Awfulot, and the <a href="/Jester" title="Jester">Jester</a>. Everything on the box was in half.
