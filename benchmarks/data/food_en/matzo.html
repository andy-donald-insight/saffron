<p><i>Matzah</i> is mentioned in the <a href="/Torah" title="Torah">Torah</a> several times in relation to <a href="/The_Exodus" title="The Exodus">The Exodus</a> from <a href="/Egypt" title="Egypt">Egypt</a>:
{{quote|That night, they are to eat the meat, roasted in the fire; they are to eat it with <b><i>matzah</i></b> and <i>maror</i>.|<a href="/Book_of_Exodus" title="Book of Exodus">Exodus</a> 12:8}}
{{quote|From the evening of the fourteenth day of the first month until the evening of the twenty-first day, you are to eat <b><i>matzah</i></b>.|<a href="/Book_of_Exodus" title="Book of Exodus">Exodus</a> 12:18}}
{{quote|You are not to eat any <i><a href="/Chametz" title="Chametz">chametz</a></i> with it; for seven days you are to eat with it <b><i>matzah</i></b>, the bread of affliction; for you came out of the land of Egypt in haste. Thus you will remember the day you left the land of Egypt as long as you live.|<a href="/Deuteronomy" title="Deuteronomy">Deuteronomy</a> 16:3}}
{{quote|For six days you are to eat <b><i>matzah</i></b>; on the seventh day there is to be a festive assembly for <a href="/Tetragrammaton" title="Tetragrammaton"><i>Ha Shem</i></a> your God; do not do any kind of work.|<a href="/Deuteronomy" title="Deuteronomy">Deuteronomy</a> 16:8}}</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Religious_significance">Religious significance</span></h2>
<p>There are numerous explanations behind the symbolism of matzah. One is historical: Passover is a commemoration of the exodus from Egypt. The biblical narrative relates that the <a href="/Israelites" title="Israelites">Israelites</a> left Egypt in such haste they could not wait for their bread dough to rise; the bread, when baked, was matzah. (<a href="/Book_of_Exodus" title="Book of Exodus">Exodus</a> 12:39). The other reason for eating matza is symbolic: On the one hand, matza symbolizes redemption and freedom, but it is also <i>lechem oni</i>, &#34;poor man&#39;s bread&#34;. Thus it serves as a reminder to be humble, and to not forget what life was like in servitude. Also, leaven symbolizes corruption and pride as leaven &#34;puffs up&#34;. Eating the &#34;bread of affliction&#34; is both a lesson in humility and an act that enhances the appreciation of freedom.</p>
<p>Another explanation is that matza has been used to replace the pesach, or the traditional Passover offering that was made before the destruction of the Temple. During the Seder the third time the matza is eaten it is preceded with the <a href="/Sephardi_Jews" title="Sephardi Jews">Sefardic</a> rite, &#34;zekher l’korban pesach hane’ekhal al hasova&#34;. This means &#34;remembrance of the Passover offering, eaten while full&#34;. This last piece of the matza eaten is called <a href="/Afikoman" title="Afikoman">afikoman</a> and many explain it as a symbol of salvation in the future.</p>
<p>The Passover Seder meal is full of symbols of salvation, including the opening of the door for <a href="/Elijah" title="Elijah">Elijah</a> and the closing line, “Next year in <a href="/Jerusalem" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>,” but the use of matzah is the oldest symbol of salvation in the Seder.&#60;ref&#62;Bradshaw, Paul F., and Hoffman Lawrence A.. Passover and Easter: The Symbolic Structuring of Sacred Seasons. Notre Dame, Indiana: University of Notre Dame Press, 1999.&#60;/ref&#62;</p>

<p>At the <a href="/Passover_seder" title="Passover seder">Passover seder</a>, it is customary to eat matzah made of flour and water; matzah containing <a href="/Egg_(food)" title="Egg (food)">eggs</a>, <a href="/Wine" title="Wine">wine</a>, or <a href="/Fruit_juice" title="Fruit juice">fruit juice</a> in addition to water is not considered acceptable for use at the seder.&#60;ref&#62;Mishna Brurah 462:1 1&#60;/ref&#62; The flour can be made from the five grains mentioned in the Torah: <a href="/Wheat" title="Wheat">wheat</a>, <a href="/Barley" title="Barley">barley</a>, <a href="/Spelt" title="Spelt">spelt</a>, <a href="/Rye" title="Rye">rye</a> and <a href="/Oats" title="Oats">oats</a>.</p>

<p>Matzah dough is quickly mixed and rolled out without an <a href="/Autolysis_(biology)#Use" title="Autolysis (biology)">autolyse</a> step as used for leavened breads. Most forms are pricked with a fork or a similar tool to keep the finished product from puffing up, and the resulting flat piece of dough is cooked at high temperature until it develops dark spots, then set aside to cool and, if sufficiently thin, to harden to crispness.  Dough is considered to begin the leavening process 18 minutes from the time it gets wet; sooner if eggs, fruit juice, or milk is added to the dough. The entire process of making matzah takes only a few minutes in efficient modern matzah bakeries.</p>
<p>After baking, matzah may be ground into fine crumbs, known as matzah meal.</p>

There are two major forms of matza. In many western countries the most common form is the hard form of matza which is cracker-like in appearance and taste and is used in all <a href="/Ashkenazic" title="Ashkenazic">Ashkenazic</a> and most <a href="/Sephardic" title="Sephardic">Sephardic</a> communities. <a href="/Yemenite_Jews" title="Yemenite Jews">Yemenites</a>, and <a href="/Iraqi_Jews" title="Iraqi Jews">Iraqi Jews</a> traditionally made a form of soft matza which looks like Greek <a href="/Pita" title="Pita">pita</a> or like a <a href="/Tortilla" title="Tortilla">tortilla</a>. Soft matza is made only by hand, and generally with <i>shmurah</i> flour.&#60;ref name=intime2&#62;{{cite web|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/136591" rel="nofollow">http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/136591</a> |title=In Time for the Holiday: What is Matzah?

<p>Flavored varieties of matzah are produced commercially, such as <a href="/Poppy" title="Poppy">poppyseed</a>- or <a href="/Onion" title="Onion">onion</a>-flavored. Oat and spelt matzah with kosher certification are produced, and are suitable for people who cannot eat wheat.

<p>Matzah contains typically 111 <a href="/Calories" title="Calories">calories</a> per 1-ounce/28g (USDA Nutrient Database), about the same as <a href="/Rye" title="Rye">rye</a> crispbread.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Shmurah_matzah">Shmurah matzah</span></h3>
<p><i>Shmura</i> (&#34;guarded&#34;) matzah (<a href="/Hebrew_language" title="Hebrew language">Hebrew</a> מַצָּה שְׁמוּרָה <i>maṣṣā šəmūrā</i>) is made from grain that has been under special supervision from the time it was harvested to ensure that no <a href="/Chametz#Fermentation" title="Chametz">fermentation</a> has occurred, and that it is suitable for eating on the first night of Passover. (<i>Shmura</i> wheat may be formed into either handmade or machine-made matzah, while non-<i>shmura</i> wheat is only used for machine-made matzah. It is possible to hand-bake matzah in <i>shmura</i> style from non-shmurah flour—this is a matter of style, it is not actually in any way <i>shmura</i>—but such matzah has rarely been produced since the introduction of machine-made matza.)</p>
<p><a href="/Haredi_Judaism" title="Haredi Judaism">Haredi Judaism</a> is scrupulous about the supervision of matzah and have the custom of baking their own or at least participating in some stage of the baking process. Rabbi <a href="/Chaim_Halberstam" title="Chaim Halberstam">Chaim Halberstam</a> of <a href="/Sanz" title="Sanz">Sanz</a> ruled that machine-made matzoth were <i>chametz</i>.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|author=חיים בן אריה ליבוש האלברשטאם |url=<a class="external free" href="http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=913&#38;st=&#38;pgnum=77&#38;hilite=" rel="nofollow">http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=913&#38;st=&#38;pgnum=77&#38;hilite=</a> |title=See SH&#34;UT Divrei Hayyim Siman 23 |publisher=Hebrewbooks.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-19}}&#60;/ref&#62;  According to that opinion, hand-made non-<i>shmurah</i> matzot may be used on the eighth day of Passover outside of the Holy Land. However the non-Hasidic Haredi community of Jerusalem follows the custom that machine-made matzah may be used, with preference to the use of <i>shmurah</i> flour, in accordance with the ruling of Rabbi <a href="/Yosef_Chaim_Sonnenfeld" title="Yosef Chaim Sonnenfeld">Yosef Chaim Sonnenfeld</a>, who ruled that machine-made matzah may be preferable to hand made in some cases. The commentators to the <a href="/Shulchan_Aruch" title="Shulchan Aruch">Shulchan Aruch</a> record that it is the custom of some of Diaspora Jewry to be scrupulous in giving Challah from the dough used for baking &#34;Matzot Mitzvah&#34; (the Shmurah Matzah eaten during <a href="/Passover" title="Passover">Passover</a>) to a <a href="/Kohen" title="Kohen">Kohen</a> child to eat.&#60;ref&#62;<a href="/Ba&#39;er_Hetev" title="Ba&#39;er Hetev">Ba&#39;er Hetev</a> to <a href="/Yoreh_De&#39;ah" title="Yoreh De&#39;ah">Yoreh De&#39;ah</a> ch. 322 (minor par. 7), <a href="/Shabbatai_HaKohen" title="Shabbatai HaKohen">Shabbatai HaKohen</a> to above chapter&#60;/ref&#62;</p>

&#34;Egg (sometimes <i>enriched</i>) matzah&#34; are matzot usually made with fruit <a href="/Juice" title="Juice">juice</a>, often <a href="/Grape" title="Grape">grape</a> or <a href="/Apple" title="Apple">apple</a> juice instead of water, but not necessarily with eggs themselves.  There is a custom among some Ashkenazi Jews not to eat them during Passover, except for the elderly, infirm, or children, who cannot digest plain matzah; these matzot are considered to be kosher for Passover if prepared otherwise properly. The issue of whether egg matzah is allowed for Passover comes down to whether there is a difference between the various liquids that can be used.  Water facilitates <a href="/Fermentation_in_food_processing" title="Fermentation in food processing">fermentation</a> of grain flour, but the question is whether fruit juice, eggs, honey, oil or milk are also deemed to do so.</p>
<p>The <a href="/Pesachim_(Talmud)" title="Pesachim (Talmud)"><i>Talmud</i>, Pesachim 35a</a>, states that liquid food extracts do not cause flour to leaven the way that water does.  According to this view, flour mixed with other liquids would not need to be treated with the same care as flour mixed with water. The <i><a href="/Tosafot" title="Tosafot">Tosafot</a></i> (commentaries) explain that such liquids only produce a leavening reaction within flour <i>if</i> they themselves have had water added to them and otherwise the dough they produce is completely permissible for consumption during Passover, whether or not made according to the laws applying to matzot.</p>
<p>As a result, <a href="/Joseph_ben_Ephraim_Karo" title="Joseph ben Ephraim Karo">Joseph ben Ephraim Karo</a>, author of the <i><a href="/Shulchan_Aruch" title="Shulchan Aruch">Shulchan Aruch</a></i> or &#34;Code of Jewish Law&#34; (<a href="/Orach_Chayim" title="Orach Chayim">Orach Chayim 462:4</a>) granted blanket permission for the use of any matzah made from non-water-based dough, including egg matzah, on Passover.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.askmoses.com/article.html?h=168&#38;o=2068731" rel="nofollow">http://www.askmoses.com/article.html?h=168&#38;o=2068731</a> |title=&#34;Is Egg Matzah okay for Passover use?&#34; - Rabbi Shais Taub of Chabad-Lubavitch |publisher=Askmoses.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-19}}&#60;/ref&#62; Many egg matzah boxes no longer include the message, “Ashkenazi custom is that egg matzah is only allowed for children, elderly and the infirm during Passover.” Even amongst those who consider that enriched matzot may not be <i>eaten</i> during Passover, it is permissible to <i>retain</i> it in the home.</p>
