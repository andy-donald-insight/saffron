English crumpets are generally circular roughly 8&#38;nbsp;cm (3&#34;) in diameter and 2&#38;nbsp;cm (0.8&#34;) thick. Their shape comes from being restrained in the pan/griddle by a shallow ring. They have a characteristic flat top with many small <a href="/Pores_(bread)" title="Pores (bread)">pores</a> and a chewy and spongy texture. They may be cooked until ready to eat warm from the pan, but are frequently left slightly undercooked so that they may be cooled and stored before being eaten freshly toasted. They are often eaten with a spread of <a href="/Butter" title="Butter">butter</a> or some alternative spread on the top of them, such as <a href="/Jam" title="Jam">jam</a>, <a href="/Honey" title="Honey">honey</a>, <a href="/Chocolate_spread" title="Chocolate spread">chocolate spread</a>, or <a href="/Yeast_extract" title="Yeast extract">yeast extract</a>.</p>
<p>In the UK, Australia, and New Zealand, branded square crumpets designed to fit easily in a standard toaster can be purchased from supermarkets.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.goldencrumpets.co.nz" rel="nofollow">Commercial website &#34;Golden Crumpets&#34;</a>&#60;/ref&#62;  </p> 
<p>A regional variation of the crumpet is the pikelet, whose name derives from the <a href="/Welsh_language" title="Welsh language">Welsh</a> <i>bara piglydd</i> or &#34;pitchy [i.e. dark or sticky] bread&#34;, later shortened simply to <i>piglydd</i>;&#60;ref name=edwards&#62;Edwards, W. P. <i>The Science of Bakery Products</i>, Royal Society of Chemistry, 2007, p. 198&#60;/ref&#62;&#60;ref name=luard&#62;Luard, E. <i>European Peasant Cookery</i>, Grub Street, 2004, p. 449&#60;/ref&#62; the early 17th century lexicographer, <a href="/Randle_Cotgrave" title="Randle Cotgrave">Randle Cotgrave</a>, spoke of &#34;our Welsh barrapycleds&#34;.&#60;ref name=eds&#62;<i>The folk-speech of south Cheshire</i>, English Dialect Society, 1887, p. 293&#60;/ref&#62; The word spread initially to the West Midlands, where it became anglicised as &#34;pikelet&#34;,&#60;ref name=wilson&#62;Wilson, C. A. <i>Food &#38; drink in Britain</i>, Barnes and Noble, 1974, p. 266&#60;/ref&#62; and subsequently to Cheshire, Lancashire, Yorkshire, and other areas of the north.</p>
<p>The main distinguishing feature of the Welsh or West Midlands pikelet is that it was traditionally cooked without a ring, with an end result rather flatter or thinner than a crumpet.&#60;ref name=&#34;edwards&#34;/&#62;&#60;ref name=davidson&#62;Davidson, A. <i>The Penguin Companion to Food</i>, 2002, p. 277&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>The term &#34;pikelet&#34; is also used in Australia and New Zealand for a similarly flat cake, of the type that in Scotland and North America would be called a pancake and in England a Scotch pancake, girdle or griddle cake, or <a href="/Drop_scone" title="Drop scone">drop scone</a>.&#60;ref&#62;<i>The Concise Household Encyclopedia</i> (ca. 1935) Fleetway House, The Amalgamated Press, London&#60;/ref&#62;</p>

<p>A <a href="/Scotland" title="Scotland">Scottish</a> crumpet are essentially a pancake cooked in a slightly different way, made from the same ingredients as a <a href="/Scotch_pancake" title="Scotch pancake">Scotch pancake</a>, and is about 180&#38;nbsp;mm (7&#38;nbsp;inches) diameter and 8&#38;nbsp;mm (0.3&#38;nbsp;inches) thick. They are available plain, or as a fruit crumpet with <a href="/Raisin" title="Raisin">raisins</a> baked in, usually fried in a pan and served with a fried breakfast - they are also sometimes served with butter and jam. The ingredients include a leavening agent, usually <a href="/Baking_powder" title="Baking powder">baking powder</a>, and different proportions of eggs, flour, and milk which create a thin batter. Unlike a pancake, they are cooked to brown on one side only, resulting in a smooth darker side where it has been heated by the griddle, then lightly cooked on the other side which has holes where bubbles have risen to the surface during cooking.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.rampantscotland.com/recipes/blrecipe_crumpets.htm" rel="nofollow">Traditional Scottish Recipes - Scottish Crumpets</a>&#60;/ref&#62; It bears little resemblance to the English crumpet.</p>
<p>This is the normal kind of crumpet in Scottish bakers&#39; shops, <a href="/Tea_room" title="Tea room">tea rooms</a>, and cafés, though the English type of crumpet is often obtainable in supermarkets in addition to the Scottish kind.</p>
<p>The South African version of the crumpet, a popular desert and breakfast treat, is almost identical to the Scottish version mentioned above.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.sustenance.co.za/2013/12/south-african-crumpets-recipe/" rel="nofollow">South African Crumpet Recipe</a>&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
