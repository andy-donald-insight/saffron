<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Casings">Casings</span></h2>
<p>{{main|Casing (sausage)}}
Traditionally, sausage casings were made of the cleaned intestines, or stomachs in the case of <a href="/Haggis" title="Haggis">haggis</a> and other traditional puddings. Today, however, natural casings are often replaced by <a href="/Collagen" title="Collagen">collagen</a>, <a href="/Cellulose" title="Cellulose">cellulose</a>, or even <a href="/Plastic" title="Plastic">plastic</a> casings, especially in the case of <a href="/Industry" title="Industry">industrially</a> <a href="/Manufacture" title="Manufacture">manufactured</a> sausages. Some forms of sausage, such as <a href="/Sliced_sausage" title="Sliced sausage">sliced sausage</a>, are prepared without a casing. Additionally, <a href="/Luncheon_meat" title="Luncheon meat">luncheon meat</a> and sausage meat are now available without casings in <a href="/Tin_can" title="Tin can">tin cans</a> and <a href="/Mason_jar" title="Mason jar">jars</a>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Ingredients">Ingredients</span></h2>
<p>A sausage consists of meat, cut into pieces or ground, and filled into a casing, with other ingredients. Ingredients may include a cheap <a href="/Starch" title="Starch">starch</a> filler such as breadcrumbs, seasoning and flavourings such as <a href="/Spice" title="Spice">spices</a>, and sometimes others. The meat may be from any animal, but is often <a href="/Pork" title="Pork">pork</a>, <a href="/Beef" title="Beef">beef</a>, or <a href="/Veal" title="Veal">veal</a>. The lean meat-to-fat <a href="/Ratio" title="Ratio">ratio</a> is dependent upon the style and producer. Speciality sausages with other ingredients such as apple and leek are also made.&#60;ref name=beebswozzle&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/pork_sausages" rel="nofollow">BBC: Pork sausage recipes</a>. &#34;The meat may be mixed with breadcrumbs, cereals or other ingredients such as leek or apple.&#34;&#60;/ref&#62; The meat content as labelled may exceed 100%; this happens when the weight of meat used exceeds the total weight of the sausage after it has been made, sometimes including a drying process which reduces water content.</p>
<p>In some jurisdictions foods described as sausages must meet regulations governing their content. For example, in the United States The <a href="/United_States_Department_of_Agriculture" title="United States Department of Agriculture">Department of Agriculture</a> specifies that the fat content of different defined types of sausage may not exceed 30%, 35% or 50% by weight; some sausages may contain binders or extenders.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~lrd/9CF319.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~lrd/9CF319.html</a>|archiveurl=<a class="external free" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071219033648/http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~lrd/9CF319.html" rel="nofollow">http://web.archive.org/web/20071219033648/http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~lrd/9CF319.html</a>|archivedate=19 December 2007|title=USDA Standards of Identity; see Subparts E, F and G}}&#60;/ref&#62;&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2012-title9-vol2/pdf/CFR-2012-title9-vol2-part319.pdf" rel="nofollow">PART 319—DEFINITIONS AND STANDARDS OF IDENTITY OR COMPOSITION, parts E, F, and G</a>&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>Many traditional styles of sausage from <a href="/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a> and <a href="/Asia" title="Asia">Asia</a> use no <a href="/Bread" title="Bread">bread</a>-based filler and include only meat (lean meat and fat) and flavorings.&#60;ref&#62;<i>Joy of Cooking</i>, Rombauer and Becker; <i>The Fine Art of Italian Cooking</i>, Bugialli&#60;/ref&#62; In the United Kingdom and other countries with <a href="/English_cuisine" title="English cuisine">English cuisine</a> traditions, many sausages contain a significant proportion of bread and starch-based fillers, which may comprise 30% of ingredients. The filler used in many sausages helps them to keep their shape as they are cooked. As the meat contracts in the <a href="/Heat" title="Heat">heat</a>, the filler expands and absorbs moisture and fat from the meat.&#60;ref name=beebbanger&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2284846.stm" rel="nofollow">BBC: What&#39;s in the great British banger?, 2002</a>&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>When the food processing industry produces sausages for a low <a href="/Price_point" title="Price point">price point</a>, almost any part of the animal can end up in sausages, varying from cheap, fatty specimens stuffed with meat blasted off the carcasses (<a href="/Mechanically_recovered_meat" title="Mechanically recovered meat">mechanically recovered meat</a>, MRM) and <a href="/Rusk" title="Rusk">rusk</a>.

<p>Sausages classification is subject to regional differences of opinion. Various metrics such as types of ingredients, consistency, and preparation are used. In the <a href="/English-speaking_world" title="English-speaking world">English-speaking world</a>, the following distinction between <i>fresh</i>, <i>cooked</i>, and <i>dry</i> sausages seems to be more or less accepted:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Cooked sausages</b> are made with fresh meats, and then fully cooked. They are either eaten immediately after cooking or must be refrigerated. Examples include <a href="/Hot_dog" title="Hot dog">hot dogs</a>, <a href="/Braunschweiger" title="Braunschweiger">Braunschweiger</a>, and <a href="/Liver_sausage" title="Liver sausage">liver sausage</a>.</li>
<li><b>Cooked smoked sausages</b> are cooked and then smoked or <a href="/Smoking_(cooking)" title="Smoking (cooking)">smoke-cooked</a>. They are eaten hot or cold, but need to be refrigerated. Examples include <a href="/Kielbasa" title="Kielbasa">kielbasa</a> and <a href="/Mortadella" title="Mortadella">mortadella</a>. Some are slow cooked while smoking, in which case the process takes several days or longer, such as the case for <i><a href="/Kolb%C3%A1sz" title="Kolbász">Gyulai kolbász</a></i>.</li>
<li><b>Fresh sausages</b> are made from meats that have not been previously cured. They must be refrigerated and thoroughly cooked before eating. Examples include <i><a href="/Boerewors" title="Boerewors">Boerewors</a></i>, <a href="/Italian_sausage" title="Italian sausage">Italian pork sausage</a>, <a href="/Siskonmakkara" title="Siskonmakkara">siskonmakkara</a>, and <a href="/Breakfast_sausage" title="Breakfast sausage">breakfast sausage</a>.</li>
<li><b>Fresh smoked sausages</b> are fresh sausages that are smoked and cured. They do not normally require refrigeration and do not require any further cooking before eating. Examples include <a href="/Mettwurst" title="Mettwurst">Mettwurst</a> and <a href="/Teewurst" title="Teewurst">Teewurst</a> which are meat preparations packed in sausage casing but squeezed out of it (just like any other spread from a tube).</li>
<li><b>Dry sausages</b> are cured sausages that are <a href="/Fermentation_(food)" title="Fermentation (food)">fermented</a> and dried. Some are smoked as well at the beginning of the drying process. They are generally eaten cold and will keep for a long time. Examples include <a href="/Salami" title="Salami">salami</a>, <a href="/Dro%C3%AB_wors" title="Droë wors">Droë wors</a>, Finnish <i>meetvursti</i>, <a href="/Sucuk" title="Sucuk">Sucuk</a>, <a href="/Landj%C3%A4ger" title="Landjäger">Landjäger</a> (smoked), <a href="/Slim_Jim_(snack_food)" title="Slim Jim (snack food)">Slim Jim</a>, and <a href="/Summer_sausage" title="Summer sausage">summer sausage</a>.</li>
<li><b>Bulk sausage</b>, or sometimes <i>sausage meat</i>, refers to raw, ground, spiced meat, usually sold without any casing.</li>
<li><b>Vegetarian sausage</b> are made without meat, for example, based on <a href="/Soybean" title="Soybean">soya</a> protein or <a href="/Tofu" title="Tofu">tofu</a>, with herbs and spices. Some vegetarian sausages are not necessarily <a href="/Vegan" title="Vegan">vegan</a>, and may contain ingredients such as <a href="/Egg_(food)" title="Egg (food)">eggs</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The distinct flavor of some sausages is due to fermentation by <i><a href="/Lactobacillus" title="Lactobacillus">Lactobacillus</a></i>, <i><a href="/Pediococcus" title="Pediococcus">Pediococcus</a></i>, or <i><a href="/Micrococcus" title="Micrococcus">Micrococcus</a></i> (added as <a href="/Starter_culture" title="Starter culture">starter cultures</a>) or natural <a href="/Flora_(microbiology)" title="Flora (microbiology)">flora</a> during curing.</p>
<p>Other countries use different systems of classification. Germany, for instance, which produces more than 1200 types of sausage, distinguishes <i>raw</i>, <i>cooked</i> and <i>precooked</i> sausages.
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Raw sausages</b> are made with raw meat and are not cooked.
