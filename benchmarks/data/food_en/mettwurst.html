<p><b>Mettwurst</b> is a strongly flavoured <a href="/Germany" title="Germany">German</a> <a href="/Sausage" title="Sausage">sausage</a>, made from raw minced pork which is preserved by <a href="/Curing_(food_preservation)" title="Curing (food preservation)">curing</a> and <a href="/Smoking_(food)" title="Smoking (food)">smoking</a>, often with garlic.

The <a href="/Low_German" title="Low German">Low German</a> word <i>mett</i>, meaning <i>minced pork without bacon</i>, is derived from the <a href="/Old_Saxon" title="Old Saxon">Old Saxon</a> word <i>meti</i> (meaning <i>food</i>), and is related to the <a href="/English_language" title="English language">English</a> word &#39;meat&#39;.
