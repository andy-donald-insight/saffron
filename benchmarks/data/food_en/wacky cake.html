<p><b>Wacky cake</b> is a spongy, cocoa-based <a href="/Cake" title="Cake">cake</a>. It is unique in that unlike most <a href="/Pastries" title="Pastries">pastries</a> and <a href="/Desserts" title="Desserts">desserts</a>, no <a href="/Egg_(food)" title="Egg (food)">eggs</a>, <a href="/Butter" title="Butter">butter</a> or <a href="/Milk" title="Milk">milk</a> are used to make the cake batter.</p>
<p>It is commonly believed{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}} Wacky Cake may have been created as the result of <a href="/Rationing_in_the_United_Kingdom" title="Rationing in the United Kingdom">rationing during World War II</a>, when milk and eggs were scarce. Active ingredients in wacky cake include flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking soda, vegetable oil, white vinegar and vanilla extract.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite book

The cake may be topped with <a href="/Icing_(food)" title="Icing (food)">icing</a> or <a href="/Confectioner&#39;s_sugar" title="Confectioner&#39;s sugar">confectioner&#39;s sugar</a>, or even served plain.</p>
<p>The cake is considered a popular delicacy at <a href="/Bake_sale" title="Bake sale">bake sales</a> in numerous rural regions of the United States.</p>
<p>Usually served with just a dusting of powdered sugar, or buttercream frosting, there  is also a frosting/glaze recipe sometimes found attached that also is made from &#34;ration&#34; ingredients.</p>
<p>There are several variations on why this confection is referred to as &#34;Wacky Cake.&#34; Many people{{Who|date=November 2015}} believe that its lack of eggs or the unconventional &#34;divot wells&#34; method of preparation. Another legend{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}} has it that a small  child, while seeing the cake being made stated, &#34;Oil and vinegar in cake! That&#39;s salad dressing! Mom, you are wacky!&#34; The legend is so pervasive among Italian American households that many believe theirs{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}} to be the family which is both the inventor of the cake and the coiner of the name.</p>
<p>In many Italian-American households  it is often the traditional birthday cake.  Sometimes the cake is cooled, removed from the pan and shapes are cut out, or the entire top may be decorated with butter cream frosting.</p>
