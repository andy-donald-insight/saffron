<p><b>Sprouted bread</b> is a type of <a href="/Bread" title="Bread">bread</a> made from <a href="/Whole_grain" title="Whole grain">whole grains</a> that have been allowed to <a href="/Sprouting" title="Sprouting">sprout</a>, that is, to germinate. There are a few different types of sprouted grain bread. Some are made with added flour, some are made with added gluten, and some, such as Essene bread, are made with very few additional ingredients.</p>

<p>These are breads that contain the whole grain (or kernel, or berry) of various seeds after they have been sprouted. They are different from &#39;white&#39; bread inasmuch as &#39;white&#39; breads are made from ground wheat <a href="/Endosperm" title="Endosperm">endosperm</a> (after removal of the bran and germ). Whole grain breads include the bran, germ and endosperm, therefore providing more fiber, and naturally occurring vitamins and proteins. Sprouted (or <a href="/Germinated" title="Germinated">germinated</a>) grain breads have roughly the same amount of vitamins per gram.</p>
<p>A comparison of nutritional analyses shows that sprouted grains contain about 75% of the energy (carbohydrates), slightly higher protein and about 40% of the fat when compared to whole grains.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|url= <a class="external free" href="http://www.ars.usda.gov/Services/docs.htm?docid=6282" rel="nofollow">http://www.ars.usda.gov/Services/docs.htm?docid=6282</a> |title=Nutritive Value of Foods, Home and Garden Bulletin No. 72 (HG-72) |publisher=United States Department of Agriculture |year= 2002|accessdate=2012-01-12}}&#60;/ref&#62;&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|url= <a class="external free" href="http://www.sproutnet.com/Nutrition/Analysis/wheat_sprouts.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.sproutnet.com/Nutrition/Analysis/wheat_sprouts.htm</a>|title=Wheat sprouts |publisher=International Specialty Supply |date= |accessdate=2012-01-12}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>Wheat is not the only grain used in sprouted breads. Grains and legumes such as millet, barley, oat, lentil and soy may be used. Bread that is made from an array of grains and legumes can provide a complete set of amino acids, the building blocks of proteins. Sprouted breads may contain slightly more trace minerals and nutrients than non-sprouted breads. Other than that, they supply much the same advantages as whole grain breads over refined grain breads, such as lowered risk of coronary heart disease.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|url= <a class="external free" href="http://articles.latimes.com/2009/oct/12/health/he-nutrition12" rel="nofollow">http://articles.latimes.com/2009/oct/12/health/he-nutrition12</a> |title=Sprouted-grain breads: the facts |publisher=Los Angeles Times |date= 2009-10-12|accessdate=2012-01-12}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>

<p>Essene bread is a very primitive form of sprouted grain bread made from sprouted wheat and prepared at a low temperature.
