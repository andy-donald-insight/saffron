They may also be available in <a href="/Confectionery_store" title="Confectionery store">candy shops</a>, produced by local or regional candymakers.</p>
<p>The diameter, thickness, and the relative proportion of its two major components vary according to the desires of the maker. Any type of chocolate may be used for the shell, but <a href="/Milk_chocolate" title="Milk chocolate">milk chocolate</a> is most common. Fillings are usually smooth, creamy peanut butter, but crunchy peanut butter, or peanut butter mixed with other flavors, is also used.</p>
<p>It is claimed{{Who|date=April 2015}} that blending some of the peanut butter used in the filling into the chocolate used in the enrobement improves the flavor of a peanut butter cup, but it is unknown whether mass production-oriented confectioners employ this method for their products.</p>

<p>The most popular brand of peanut butter cup is the <a href="/Reese&#39;s_Peanut_Butter_Cups" title="Reese&#39;s Peanut Butter Cups">Reese&#39;s Peanut Butter Cups</a> (sold as Reese in Canada), now a <a href="/The_Hershey_Company" title="The Hershey Company">Hershey</a> brand. The Reese&#39;s Peanut Butter Cup is considered the &#34;finest creation&#34; of <a href="/H._B._Reese" title="H. B. Reese">Harry Burnett &#34;H. B.&#34; Reese</a>, a former employee of Hershey&#39;s, who set up his own candy-manufacturing business in the 1920s. The company merged with <a href="/The_Hershey_Company" title="The Hershey Company">Hershey&#39;s</a> in a July 2, 1963 tax free stock-for-stock merger,&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web |url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.bradreese.com/blog/hb-reese-candy-co-hershey-chocolate-merger-agreement-draft-july-1-1963.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.bradreese.com/blog/hb-reese-candy-co-hershey-chocolate-merger-agreement-draft-july-1-1963.pdf</a> |title=The 1963 Reese/Hershey Merger Closing Agenda |accessdate=2013-10-11}}&#60;/ref&#62; seven years after the May 16, 1956 death of Reese.&#60;ref name=&#34;isbn1-888054-83-2&#34;&#62;{{cite book |author=Beth Kimmerle |title=Candy: The Sweet History |publisher=Collectors Press |location=Portland, Or |year=2003 |pages=115 |isbn=1-888054-83-2 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&#60;/ref&#62;  The famous slogans, &#34;Two great tastes that taste great together&#34; and &#34;How do you eat a Reese&#39;s?&#34; originated in marketing campaigns for this candy. The most popular slogan is &#34;There&#39;s no wrong way to eat a Reese&#39;s.&#34; The current slogan is just &#34;Perfect.&#34;</p>
<p>In recent years Reese&#39;s has experimented with different types of peanut butter cups. Some variations have used white chocolate, dark chocolate, chocolate-flavored peanut filling, and banana peanut butter in a chocolate cup sold as the Elvis Special Edition (all by Reese&#39;s).</p>
<p>Another brand is Palmer, which specializes in holiday peanut butter cups. There are various forms that the peanut butter cups take for the different seasons.  Each holiday has a different color of foil for the season. They can also come in different shapes such as Christmas trees during holiday seasons.</p>
<p>Many regional candy companies also have versions of the peanut butter cup, including Boyer Candies in Altoona, Pennsylvania.</p>
