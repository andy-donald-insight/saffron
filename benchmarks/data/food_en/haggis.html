<p>{{main|Wild Haggis}}
In the absence of hard facts as to haggis&#39; origins, popular folklore has provided some notions. One is that the dish originates from the days of the old Scottish <a href="/Drovers&#39;_road" title="Drovers&#39; road">cattle drovers</a>. When the men left the <a href="/Scottish_Highlands" title="Scottish Highlands">Highlands</a> to drive their cattle to market in <a href="/Edinburgh" title="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a> the women would prepare rations for them to eat during the long journey down through the <a href="/Glen" title="Glen">glens</a>. They used the ingredients that were most readily available in their homes and conveniently packaged them in a sheep&#39;s stomach allowing for easy transportation during the journey. Other speculations have been based on Scottish slaughtering practices. When a <a href="/Chiefs_of_the_Name" title="Chiefs of the Name">chieftain</a> or <a href="/Laird" title="Laird">laird</a> required an animal to be slaughtered for meat (whether sheep or cattle) the workmen were allowed to keep the <a href="/Offal" title="Offal">offal</a> as their share.</p>
<p>A joke sometimes maintained is that a haggis is <a href="/Wild_Haggis" title="Wild Haggis">a small Scottish animal</a> with longer legs on one side, so that it can run around the steep hills of the Scottish Highlands without falling over. The Hebridean Haggis is &#34;thought&#34; to be the original native species. The Lewis Haggis is different from the Haggis on the mainland: unlike its mainland relative all its legs are of the same length.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.thehaggis.com/EZ/sh/sh/page07.php" rel="nofollow">&#34;Haggis History&#34;</a> thehaggis.com.&#60;/ref&#62; According to one poll, 33% of American visitors to Scotland believed haggis to be an animal.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2003/nov/27/travelnews.travel" rel="nofollow">&#34;American tourists believe Haggis is an animal&#34;</a>, guardian.co.uk, 2003-11-27.&#60;/ref&#62;</p>

<p>Haggis is traditionally served as part of the <a href="/Burns_supper" title="Burns supper">Burns supper</a> on or near January 25, the birthday of Scotland&#39;s national poet <a href="/Robert_Burns" title="Robert Burns">Robert Burns</a>. Burns wrote the poem <i><a href="//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Address_to_a_Haggis">Address to a Haggis</a></i>, which starts &#34;Fair fa&#39; your honest, sonsie face, Great chieftain o&#39; the puddin-race!&#34; In Burns&#39;s lifetime haggis was a common dish of the poor as it was nourishing yet very cheap, being made from leftover parts of sheep otherwise thrown away.</p>
<p>Haggis is widely available in supermarkets in Scotland all year, with cheaper brands normally packed in artificial casings, rather than stomachs. Sometimes haggis is sold in tins or a container which can be cooked in a microwave or conventional oven. Some commercial haggis is largely made from pig, rather than sheep, offal.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://ramsayofcarluke.co.uk/products/traditional-ball-haggis-1kg/" rel="nofollow">A commercially available &#34;traditional ball haggis&#34; in a natural casing with pork and lamb parts, and beef suet</a>&#60;/ref&#62; Kosher haggis, not only pork-free but fully conformant to <a href="/Jewish_dietary_laws" title="Jewish dietary laws">Jewish dietary laws</a>, is produced.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://thejc.newspaperdirect.com/epaper/viewer.aspx" rel="nofollow">The Jewish Chronicle: Kosher haggis</a>&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>Haggis is often served in Scottish fast-food establishments deep fried in batter. Together with <a href="/French_fries" title="French fries">chips</a>, this comprises a &#34;haggis supper&#34;.

<p>Haggis remains popular with expatriate Scots in the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, owing to the strong influence of Scottish culture, especially for Burns Suppers. It can easily be made in any country, but is sometimes imported from Scotland. A recipe from the Canadian province of New Brunswick uses pork and bakes it in a loaf pan.</p>
<p>In 1971 it became illegal to import haggis into the US from the UK due to a ban on food containing sheep lung, which constitutes 10 to 15% of the traditional recipe.&#60;ref name=USABAN&#62;{{cite news|title=US not ready to lift ban on Scottish haggis|url=<a class="external free" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/8480795.stm" rel="nofollow">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/8480795.stm</a>|publisher=BBC News|date=2010-01-26|accessdate=2011-01-19}}&#60;/ref&#62; The situation was further complicated in 1989 when all UK beef and lamb was banned from importation to the US due to a <a href="/Bovine_spongiform_encephalopathy" title="Bovine spongiform encephalopathy">BSE</a> crisis.&#60;ref name=USABAN/&#62; In 2010 a spokeswoman for the US Department of Agriculture stated that they were reviewing the ban on beef and lamb products, but that the ban on food containing sheep lung would remain in force.&#60;ref name=USABAN/&#62;</p>
<p>As haggis cannot be exported to the United States, it is instead made there, sometimes by Scottish companies.
