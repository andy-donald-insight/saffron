<p><b>Slow Bread</b> is made using very little yeast and lots of time to ferment the dough before baking. The advantage is that the starch in the flour absorbs the water much more effectively. During the period of rest the yeast multiplies and develops by-products like alcohol, acetic and lactic acids.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}</p>
<p>The structure of the crumb is much more open.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}</p>
<p>Because the starch and gluten in the dough is &#34;opened up&#34; during the process the bread is easier to digest compared to bread made using the newest technology.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}</p>
