<p>Fat rascals were known in the Yorkshire region in the nineteenth century as a form of tea cake containing butter and cream.&#60;ref&#62;{{Cite web|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.foodsofengland.co.uk/fatrascals.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.foodsofengland.co.uk/fatrascals.htm</a> |accessdate=2013-12-14 |title=Fat Rascals |website=The Foods of England Project |quote=The origin of the name is obscure, it is known in this context at least since the 1855 <i>Glossary of Yorkshire Words and Phrases Collected in Whitby and the Neighbourhood</i> of 1855 where the definition of &#39;Spice Cake&#39; is given as; &#34;tea cakes with currants as well as cakes more generally, known as plum cakes for which this quarter is famous. The tea cakes made rich with butter and cream are called fat rascals.&#34;}}&#60;/ref&#62; An 1859 <a href="/Charles_Dickens" title="Charles Dickens">Charles Dickens</a> story identifies the fat rascal with the <a href="/Singing_hinny" title="Singing hinny">singing hinny</a> of Northumberland.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite journal |work=<a href="/All_the_Year_Round" title="All the Year Round">All the Year Round</a> |first=Charles |last=Dickens |title=Mother&#39;s First Lodger |quote=...we used to have cakes something of the same kind at home, when I was a girl, but they called them <i>singing hinnies</i>.

A 1980 Yorkshire cookbook described fat rascals as a means of using leftover pastry, typically consisting of scraps of shortcrust pastry, sugared, sprinkled with currants and rolled into thick flat cakes before baking.&#60;ref name=&#34;Moore1980&#34;&#62;{{cite book|last=Moore|first=Mary Hanson|title=A Yorkshire Cookbook|url=<a class="external free" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=Twy4HQAACAAJ" rel="nofollow">http://books.google.com/books?id=Twy4HQAACAAJ</a>|year=1980|publisher=David &#38; Charles Publishers|isbn=978-0-7153-7892-2}}&#60;/ref&#62; Fat rascals, whatever their composition, do not appear to have been widely known outside the Yorkshire region until the 1980s, although there are occasional mentions in other regions, such as in Rye, Sussex in <a href="/Ford_Madox_Ford" title="Ford Madox Ford">Ford Madox Ford</a>&#39;s 1931 memoirs.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite book|last1=Ford|first1=Ford Madox|title=Return to Yesterday|date=1931|publisher=Victor Gollancz|location=London|page=9}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>There is a recipe for Fat Rascals in a book called &#34;The Presidents&#39; Cook Book&#34; by Poppy Cannon and Patricia Brooks published in 1968 by Funk and Wagnalls in the USA. 
They say &#34; In Edith Roosevelt&#39;s most cherished cook book .... is this recipe for hot biscuits.&#34;
This cook book now rests on a shelf in the parlour of Sagamore Hill.</p>

<p>A widely recognised version of the Fat Rascal was introduced by <a href="/Bettys_and_Taylors_of_Harrogate" title="Bettys and Taylors of Harrogate">Bettys Café Tea Rooms</a> in North Yorkshire in 1983. This is a plump, fruity scone with a &#39;face&#39; made from cherries and almonds based on a <a href="/Rock_cake" title="Rock cake">rock cake</a> recipe, developed by Helen Frankel, then a buyer and marketing assistant at Bettys. Following its launch, the Fat Rascal quickly became Bettys’ best known and best-selling bakery product, selling over 375,000 per year.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}  Bettys &#38; Taylors of Harrogate own the registered trade mark for the name &#39;fat rascal&#39;.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external free" href="http://www.ipo.gov.uk/tmcase/Results/1/UK00002486947&#60;/ref&#38;gt" rel="nofollow">http://www.ipo.gov.uk/tmcase/Results/1/UK00002486947&#60;/ref&#38;gt</a>;</p>
