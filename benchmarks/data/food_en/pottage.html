<p><b>Pottage</b> is a thick <a href="/Soup" title="Soup">soup</a> or <a href="/Stew" title="Stew">stew</a> made by boiling <a href="/Vegetable" title="Vegetable">vegetables</a>, <a href="/Grain" title="Grain">grains</a>, and, if available, <a href="/Meat" title="Meat">meat</a> or <a href="/Fish" title="Fish">fish</a>.</p>
<p>It was a <a href="/Staple_food" title="Staple food">staple food</a> from <a href="/Neolithic" title="Neolithic">neolithic</a> times to the <a href="/Middle_Ages" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a>.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} The word <i>pottage</i> comes from the same <a href="/Old_French" title="Old French">Old French</a> root as <i><a href="/Potage" title="Potage">potage</a></i>, which is a similar type of dish of more recent origin.</p>
<p>Pottage commonly consisted of various ingredients easily available to <a href="/Serf" title="Serf">serfs</a> and <a href="/Peasant" title="Peasant">peasants</a> and could be kept over the fire for a period of days, during which time some of it was eaten and more ingredients added. The result was a dish that was constantly changing. Pottage consistently remained a staple of the poor&#39;s diet throughout most of 9th to 17th-century Europe. When people of higher economic rank, such as nobles, ate pottage, they would add more expensive ingredients such as meats. The pottage that these people ate was much like modern day soups. {{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} This is similar to the Welsh <a href="/Cawl" title="Cawl">cawl</a>, which is a broth, soup or stew often cooked on and off for days at a time over the fire in a traditional <a href="/Inglenook" title="Inglenook">inglenook</a>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Preparation">Preparation</span></h2>
<p>Pottage was typically boiled for several hours until the entire mixture took on a homogeneous texture and flavour; this was intended to break down complex <a href="/Starch" title="Starch">starches</a> and to ensure the food was safe for consumption. It was often served, when possible, with bread.</p>
