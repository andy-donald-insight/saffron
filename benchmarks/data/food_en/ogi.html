The OGI School of Science and Engineering had four divisions: Biomedical Engineering, Biomedical Computer Science, and Environmental &#38; Biomolecular Systems.&#60;ref name=about&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.ogi.edu/about/" rel="nofollow">About OGI.</a> Oregon Graduate Institute, accessed October 11, 2007.&#60;/ref&#62; It had a student body of about 330 full-time students, with about one-third of those seeking PhDs.  The student body also included about 250 non-degree students.&#60;ref name=about/&#62;</p>
<p>Since OGI&#39;s merger with OHSU, research conducted at the School has increasingly focused on applying technology to complex problems of human and ecosystem health. The school&#39;s Department of Management in Science and Technology (MST) focused on educating leaders and managers in a technology-intensive world.  The program changed to <a class="external text" href="http://www.ohsu.edu/xd/education/schools/school-of-medicine/departments/basic-science-departments/division-of-management/" rel="nofollow">OHSU&#39;s Division of Management</a> offering a certificate and Masters degrees in Healthcare Management.</p>
<p>Formal research centers at the school included the Adaptive Systems Lab, Biomedical Optics Group, Center for Coastal and Land Margin Research, Center for Groundwater Research, and <a class="external text" href="http://www.ohsu.edu/xd/education/schools/school-of-medicine/departments/basic-science-departments/biomedical-engineering/center-for-spoken-language-understanding/" rel="nofollow">Center for Spoken Language Understanding</a>, whose focus is on spoken language technologies and continues to offer Computer Science and Electrical Engineering degrees.
