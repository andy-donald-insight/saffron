<p><b>Bread</b> is a <a href="/Staple_food" title="Staple food">staple food</a> prepared from a <a href="/Dough" title="Dough">dough</a> of <a href="/Flour" title="Flour">flour</a> and <a href="/Water" title="Water">water</a>, usually by <a href="/Baking" title="Baking">baking</a>. Throughout recorded history it has been popular around the world and is one of the oldest artificial foods, having been of importance since the dawn of <a href="/Agriculture#History" title="Agriculture">agriculture</a>.</p>
<p>There are many combinations and proportions of types of flour and other ingredients, and also of different traditional recipes and modes of preparation of bread. As a result, there are wide varieties of types, shapes, sizes, and textures of breads in various regions.  Bread may be <a href="/Leaven" title="Leaven">leavened</a> by many different processes ranging from the use of naturally occurring microbes (for example in <a href="/Sourdough" title="Sourdough">sourdough</a> recipes) to high-pressure artificial aeration methods during preparation or baking. However, some products are left unleavened, either for preference, or for traditional or religious reasons. Many non-cereal ingredients may be included, ranging from fruits and nuts to various fats. Commercial bread in particular, commonly contains additives, some of them non-nutritional, to improve flavor, texture, color, shelf life, or ease of manufacturing.</p>
<p>Depending on local custom and convenience, bread may be served in various forms at any meal of the day. It also is eaten as a snack, or used as an ingredient in other culinary preparations, such as fried items coated in crumbs to prevent sticking, or the bland main component of a <a href="/Bread_pudding" title="Bread pudding">bread pudding</a>, or <a href="/Stuffing" title="Stuffing">stuffings</a> designed to fill cavities or retain juices that otherwise might drip away.</p>
<p>Partly because of its importance as a basic foodstuff, bread has a social and emotional significance beyond its importance in nutrition; it plays essential roles in religious rituals and secular culture. Its prominence in daily life is reflected in language, where it appears in proverbs, colloquial expressions (&#34;He stole the bread from my mouth&#34;), in prayer (&#34;Give us this day our daily bread&#34;) and even in the etymology of words, such as &#34;<a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/companion">companion</a>&#34; and &#34;<a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/company">company</a>&#34; (literally those who eat/share bread with you).</p>

<p>Bread is one of the oldest prepared foods. Evidence from 30,000 years ago in Europe revealed starch residue on rocks used for pounding plants.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.physorg.com/news/2010-10-prehistoric-ate-flatbread-years.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.physorg.com/news/2010-10-prehistoric-ate-flatbread-years.html</a>|title=Prehistoric man ate flatbread 30,000 years ago: study|date=19 October 2010|publisher=Physorg.com|agency=Agence France-Presse|accessdate=19 October 2010}}&#60;/ref&#62; It is possible that during this time, starch extract from the roots of plants, such as cattails and ferns, was spread on a flat rock, placed over a fire and cooked into a primitive form of flatbread. Around 10,000 BC, with the dawn of the <a href="/Neolithic" title="Neolithic">Neolithic</a> age and the spread of agriculture, grains became the mainstay of making bread. Yeast spores are ubiquitous, including the surface of <a href="/Cereal" title="Cereal">cereal grains</a>, so any dough left to rest will become naturally leavened.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite book | first=Harold| last=McGee | year=2004 | title=On food and cooking | publisher=Scribner | isbn=0-684-80001-2|page=517}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>There were multiple sources of <a href="/Leavening" title="Leavening">leavening</a> available for early bread. Airborne yeasts could be harnessed by leaving uncooked dough exposed to air for some time before cooking. <a href="/Pliny_the_Elder" title="Pliny the Elder">Pliny the Elder</a> reported that the <a href="/Gauls" title="Gauls">Gauls</a> and <a href="/Iberians" title="Iberians">Iberians</a> used the foam skimmed from <a href="/Beer" title="Beer">beer</a> to produce &#34;a lighter kind of bread than other peoples.&#34; Parts of the ancient world that drank wine instead of beer used a paste composed of <a href="/Grape" title="Grape">grape</a> juice and flour that was allowed to begin fermenting, or wheat bran steeped in <a href="/Wine" title="Wine">wine</a>, as a source for <a href="/Yeast" title="Yeast">yeast</a>. The most common source of leavening was to retain a piece of dough from the previous day to use as a form of sourdough <a href="/Bread_starter" title="Bread starter">starter</a>.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite book | first=Reay | last=Tannahill | year=1973 | title=Food in History | publisher=Stein and Day | isbn=0-8128-1437-1 |pages=68–69}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>In 1961 the <a href="/Chorleywood_bread_process" title="Chorleywood bread process">Chorleywood bread process</a> was developed, which used the intense mechanical working of dough to dramatically reduce the <a href="/Fermentation_(food)" title="Fermentation (food)">fermentation</a> period and the time taken to produce a loaf. The process, whose high-energy mixing allows for the use of lower protein grain, is now widely used around the world in large factories. As a result, bread can be produced very quickly and at low costs to the manufacturer and the consumer. However, there has been some criticism of the effect on nutritional value.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20120522022319/http://www.allotment.org.uk/recipes/bread-making/chorleywood-process" rel="nofollow">Chorleywood Industrial Bread Making Process</a>. allotment.org.uk&#60;/ref&#62;</p>

Fresh bread is prized for its taste, aroma, quality, appearance and texture. Retaining its freshness is important to keep it appetizing.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Flour">Flour</span></h3>
<p>{{Main|Flour}}
<a href="/Flour" title="Flour">Flour</a> is a product made from grain that has been ground to a powdery consistency. Flour provides the primary structure to the final baked bread. While wheat flour is most commonly used for breads, flours made from rye, barley, maize, and other grains are also commonly available. Each of these grains provides the starch and protein needed to form bread.</p>
<p>The <a href="/Protein" title="Protein">protein</a> content of the flour is the best indicator of the quality of the bread <a href="/Dough" title="Dough">dough</a> and the finished bread. While bread can be made from all-purpose wheat flour, a specialty bread flour, containing more protein (12–14%), is recommended for high-quality bread. If one uses a flour with a lower protein content (9–11%) to produce bread, a shorter mixing time will be required to develop gluten strength properly. An extended mixing time leads to oxidization of the dough, which gives the finished product a whiter crumb, instead of the cream color preferred by most artisan bakers.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite book |author=Jeffrey Hamelman |title=Bread: a baker&#39;s book of techniques and recipes |publisher=John Wiley |location=New York |year=2004 |pages=7–13 |quote=A high gluten white flour will require more mix time than a white flour with a lower gluten content,... |isbn=0-471-16857-2 }}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>Wheat flour, in addition to its starch, contains three water-soluble protein groups (<a href="/Albumin" title="Albumin">albumin</a>, <a href="/Globulin" title="Globulin">globulin</a>, and <a href="/Proteose" title="Proteose">proteoses</a>) and two water-insoluble protein groups (<a href="/Glutenin" title="Glutenin">glutenin</a> and <a href="/Gliadin" title="Gliadin">gliadin</a>). When flour is mixed with water, the water-soluble proteins dissolve, leaving the glutenin and gliadin to form the structure of the resulting bread. When relatively dry dough is worked by <a href="/Kneading" title="Kneading">kneading</a>, or wet dough is allowed to rise for a long time (see <a href="/No-knead_bread" title="No-knead bread">no-knead bread</a>), the glutenin forms strands of long, thin, chainlike molecules, while the shorter gliadin forms bridges between the strands of glutenin. The resulting networks of strands produced by these two proteins are known as <a href="/Gluten" title="Gluten">gluten</a>. Gluten development improves if the dough is allowed to <a href="/Autolyse" title="Autolyse">autolyse</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Liquids">Liquids</span></h3>
<p>Water, or some other liquid, is used to form the flour into a paste or dough.

<p><a href="/Leavening" title="Leavening">Leavening</a> is the process of adding gas to a dough before or during baking to produce a lighter, more easily chewed bread.

In contrast, <a href="/Orthodox_Christian" title="Orthodox Christian">Orthodox Christians</a> always use leavened bread during their liturgy.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Chemical_leavening">Chemical leavening</span></h4>
<p>A simple technique for leavening bread is the use of gas-producing chemicals.  There are two common methods. The first is to use <a href="/Baking_powder" title="Baking powder">baking powder</a> or a <a href="/Self-rising_flour" title="Self-rising flour">self-rising flour</a> that includes baking powder.

Many breads are leavened by <a href="/Yeast" title="Yeast">yeast</a>. The yeast most commonly used for leavening bread is <i><a href="/Saccharomyces_cerevisiae" title="Saccharomyces cerevisiae">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</a></i>, the same species used for brewing alcoholic beverages. This yeast ferments some of the <a href="/Carbohydrate" title="Carbohydrate">carbohydrates</a> in the flour, including any <a href="/Sugar" title="Sugar">sugar</a>, producing <a href="/Carbon_dioxide" title="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</a>. Most bakers in the U.S. leaven their dough with commercially produced <a href="/Baker&#39;s_yeast" title="Baker&#39;s yeast">baker&#39;s yeast</a>. Baker&#39;s yeast has the advantage of producing uniform, quick, and reliable results, because it is obtained from a <a href="/Pure_culture" title="Pure culture">pure culture</a>. Many artisan bakers produce their own yeast by preparing a growth culture that they then use in the making of bread. When this culture is kept in the right conditions, it will continue to grow and provide leavening for many years.</p>
<p>Both the baker&#39;s yeast and the sourdough methods of baking bread follow the same pattern. Water is mixed with flour, salt and the leavening agent (baker&#39;s yeast or <a href="/Sourdough" title="Sourdough">sourdough</a> starter). Other additions (spices, herbs, fats, seeds, fruit, etc.) are not needed to bake bread, but are often used. The mixed dough is then allowed to <a href="/Proofing_(baking_technique)" title="Proofing (baking technique)">rise</a> one or more times (a longer rising time results in more flavor, so bakers often &#34;punch down&#34; the dough and let it rise again), then loaves are formed, and (after an optional final rising time) the bread is baked in an <a href="/Oven" title="Oven">oven</a>.</p>
<p>Many breads are made from a &#34;<a href="/Straight_dough" title="Straight dough">straight dough</a>&#34;, which means that all of the ingredients are combined in one step, and the dough is baked after the rising time; others are made from a &#34;<a href="/Pre-ferment" title="Pre-ferment">pre-ferment</a>&#34; in which the leavening agent is combined with some of the flour and water a day or so ahead of baking and allowed to ferment overnight. On the day of the baking, the rest of the ingredients are added, and process continues as with straight dough. This produces a more flavorful bread with better texture.</p>
<p>Many bakers see the starter method as a compromise between the highly reliable results of baker&#39;s yeast and the flavor and complexity of a longer fermentation. It also allows the baker to use only a minimal amount of baker&#39;s yeast, which was scarce and expensive when it first became available. Most yeasted pre-ferments fall into one of three categories: &#34;<a href="/Poolish" title="Poolish">poolish</a>&#34; or &#34;pouliche&#34;, a loose-textured mixture composed of roughly equal amounts of flour and water (by weight); &#34;<a href="/Biga_(bread_baking)" title="Biga (bread baking)">biga</a>&#34;, a stiff mixture with a higher proportion of flour; and &#34;pâte fermentée&#34;, which is simply a portion of dough reserved from a previous batch. Sourdough (also known as &#34;levain&#34; or &#34;natural leaven&#34;) takes the pre-ferment method a step further, mixing flour and water to allow naturally occurring yeast and bacteria to propagate (usually <i>Saccharomyces exiguus</i>, which is more acid-tolerant than <i>S. cerevisiae</i> and various species of <i><a href="/Lactobacillus" title="Lactobacillus">Lactobacillus</a></i>).</p>

<p>Sourdough is a type of bread produced by a long fermentation of dough using naturally occurring yeasts and lactobacilli. In comparison with breads made with cultivated yeast, it usually has a mildly sour taste because of the lactic acid produced by the lactobacilli.</p>
<p>Sourdough breads are made with a sourdough starter (which differs from starters made with baker&#39;s yeast). The starter cultivates yeast and lactobacilli in a mixture of flour and water, making use of the microorganisms already present on flour; it does not need any added yeast. A starter may be maintained indefinitely by regular additions of flour and water. Some bakers have starters several generations old, which are said to have a special taste or texture. It is possible to obtain existing starter cultures to begin a new one.</p>
<p>At one time, all yeast-leavened breads were sourdoughs.  The leavening process was not understood until the 19th century, when yeast was first identified. Since then, strains of Saccaromyces cerevisiae have been bred for their reliability and speed of leavening and sold as &#34;baker&#39;s yeast&#34;. Baker&#39;s yeast was adopted for the simpicity and flexibility it introduced to bread making, obviating the lengthy cultivation of a sourdough starter. While sourdough breads survived in some parts of Europe, throughout most of the U.S., they were replaced by baker&#39;s yeast.  Recently there has been a revival of sourdough bread in artisan bakeries.</p>
<p>There are other ways of sourdough baking and culture maintenance. A more traditional one is the process that was followed by peasant families throughout Europe in past centuries. The family (usually the woman was in charge of breadmaking) would bake on a fixed schedule, perhaps once a week. The starter was saved from the previous week&#39;s dough. The starter was mixed with the new ingredients, the dough was left to rise, and then a piece of it was saved (to be the starter for next week&#39;s bread). The rest was formed into loaves that were marked with the family sign (this is where today&#39;s decorative slashing of bread loaves originates from) and taken to the communal oven to bake. These communal ovens with time evolved into the modern bakery.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Steam">Steam</span></h4>
<p>The rapid expansion of steam produced during baking leavens the bread, which is as simple as it is unpredictable. The best known steam-leavened bread is the <a href="/Popover" title="Popover">popover</a>. Steam-leavening is unpredictable since the steam is not produced until the bread is baked.</p>
<p>Steam leavening happens regardless of the rising agents (baking soda, yeast, baking powder, sour dough, beaten egg whites, etc.).
</p>
<ul>
<li>The leavening agent either contains air bubbles or generates carbon dioxide.</li>
<li>The heat vaporises the water from the inner surface of the bubbles within the dough.</li>
<li>The steam expands and makes the bread rise.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the main factor in the rise of bread once it has been put in the oven.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite book |author=Edwards, W.P.|title=The science of bakery products |publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry |location=Cambridge, Eng |year=2007 |page=68 |isbn=0-85404-486-8 |url=<a class="external free" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=oCVPjK0mSfkC&#38;pg=PA68" rel="nofollow">http://books.google.com/books?id=oCVPjK0mSfkC&#38;pg=PA68</a>|quote=When bread expands in the oven the resulting expansion is known as oven spring.

<p><a href="/Aerated_bread" title="Aerated bread">Aerated bread</a> is leavened by carbon dioxide being forced into dough under pressure.

<p>Fats, such as butter, vegetable oils, lard, or that contained in eggs, affect the development of gluten in breads by coating and lubricating the individual strands of protein. They also help to hold the structure together. If too much fat is included in a bread dough, the lubrication effect will cause the protein structures to divide. A fat content of approximately 3% by weight is the concentration that will produce the greatest leavening action.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite book |author=Young, Linda; Cauvain, Stanley P. |title=Technology of Breadmaking |publisher=Springer |location=Berlin |year=2007 |page=54 |isbn=0-387-38563-0 |url=<a class="external free" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=HXtJivmeDfcC&#38;pg=PA54" rel="nofollow">http://books.google.com/books?id=HXtJivmeDfcC&#38;pg=PA54</a>}}&#60;/ref&#62; In addition to their effects on leavening, fats also serve to tenderize breads and preserve freshness.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Nutritional_significance">Nutritional significance</span></h3>
<p>Nutritionally, bread is known as an ample source for the grains category of nutrition. Serving size of bread is standard through ounces, counting one slice of bread (white processed bread) as 1 oz. Also, bread is considered a good source of carbohydrates through the whole grains, nutrients such as magnesium, iron, selenium, B vitamins, and dietary fiber. 
As part of the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans,&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.health.gov/dietaryguidelines/dga2010/DietaryGuidelines2010.pdf" rel="nofollow">Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2010</a>. U.S. Department of Agriculture, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services&#60;/ref&#62; it is recommended to make at least half of the recommended total grain intake as whole grains and to overall increase whole grains intake.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Shelf_life">Shelf life</span></h3>
<p>In 2009, a natural preservative for extending the shelf life of bread for up to two weeks (as opposed to a few days) had been patented and licensed to Puratos, a Belgium-based baking ingredients company that supplies to more than 100 countries. The breakthrough was pioneered by Prof Elke Arendt at the University College Cork (UCC) by incorporating into the bread a lactic acid bacteria strain which also &#34;produces a fine crumb texture&#34; and &#34;improves the flavour, volume and nutritional value of the food as well.&#34; Prior to this, &#34;About 20% of all bread is thrown out due to shelf-life issues.&#34;&#60;ref&#62;{{cite news|last=Ring|first=Evelyn|title=Bread that stays fresh for 2 weeks to hit shelves by year-end|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/bread-that-stays-fresh-for-2-weeks-to-hit-shelves-by-year-end-102530.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/bread-that-stays-fresh-for-2-weeks-to-hit-shelves-by-year-end-102530.html</a>|newspaper=Irish Examiner|date=5 October 2009}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Crust">Crust</span></h3>
<p>The bread crust is formed from surface dough during the cooking process. It is hardened and browned through the <a href="/Maillard_reaction" title="Maillard reaction">Maillard reaction</a> using the sugars and amino acids and the intense heat at the bread surface. The nature of a bread&#39;s crust differs depending on the type of bread and the way it is baked. Commercial bread is baked using jets that direct steam toward the bread to help produce a desirable crust.</p>
<p>The crust of most breads is less soft, and more complexly and intensely flavored, than the rest, and judgments vary among individuals and cultures as to whether it is therefore the less palatable or the more flavorful part of a particular style of bread. Some manufacturers, including {{as of|2009|September| |lc=yes}} <a href="/Sara_Lee_(brand)" title="Sara Lee (brand)">Sara Lee</a>, market traditional and <a href="/Crustless_bread" title="Crustless bread">crustless breads</a>.</p>
<p>The first and last slices of a loaf (or a slice with a high <a href="/Ratio" title="Ratio">ratio</a> of crust-area to volume compared to others of the same loaf) are sometimes referred to as the heel or the crust of the loaf.&#60;ref name=&#34;dialect survey&#34;&#62;{{cite web|last=Vaux|first=Bert|title=Dialect Survey: What do you call the end of a loaf of bread?|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www4.uwm.edu/FLL/linguistics/dialect/staticmaps/q_111.html" rel="nofollow">http://www4.uwm.edu/FLL/linguistics/dialect/staticmaps/q_111.html</a>|accessdate=2 March 2013}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>

Traditional breads in the <a href="/United_States" title="United States">United States</a> include cornbreads and various quick breads, such as biscuits. Rolls, made from wheat flour and yeast, are another popular and traditional bread, eaten with the dinner meal. </p>
<p><a href="/Cornbread" title="Cornbread">Cornbread</a> is made from cornmeal and can differ significantly in taste and texture from region to region. In general, the <a href="/Southern_United_States" title="Southern United States">South</a> prefers white cornmeal with little to no wheat flour or sweeteners added; it is traditionally baked in a cast-iron skillet and ideally has a crunchy outside and moist inside. The <a href="/Northern_United_States" title="Northern United States">North</a> usually prefers yellow cornmeal with sometimes as much as half wheat flour in its composition, as well as sugar, honey, or maple syrup. This results in a bread that is softer and sweeter than its southern counterpart. Wheat flour was not available to the average North American family until the early 1900s when a new breed of wheat termed <a href="/Red_Fife_wheat" title="Red Fife wheat">Marquis</a> was produced. This was a hybrid of Red Fife and <a href="/Hard_red_winter_wheat" title="Hard red winter wheat">Hard red winter wheat</a>. Marquis grew well and soon average Americans were able to have homemade wheat bread on the table.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite book|last1=Katz|first1=Solomon|title=Charles Scribner&#39;s Sons,|publisher=Gale|location=New York|pages=531|edition=Vol 3}}&#60;/ref&#62; Homemade wheat breads are made in a rectangular tin similar to those in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>Spoon bread, also called batter bread or egg bread, is made of cornmeal with or without added rice and hominy, and is mixed with milk, eggs, shortening and leavening to such a consistency that it must be served from the baking dish with a spoon. This is popular chiefly in the South.</p>

<p>Up until the 20th century (and even later in certain regions), any flour other than cornmeal was considered a luxury; this would explain the greater variety in cornbread types compared to that of wheat breads. In terms of commercial manufacture, the most popular bread has been a soft-textured type with a thin crust that is usually made with milk and is slightly sweet; this is the type that is generally sold ready-sliced in packages. It is usually eaten with the crust, but some eaters or preparers may remove the crust due to a personal preference or style of serving, as with finger sandwiches served with <a href="/Afternoon_tea" title="Afternoon tea">afternoon tea</a>. Some of the softest bread, including <a href="/Wonder_Bread" title="Wonder Bread">Wonder Bread</a>, is referred to as &#34;balloon bread&#34;.</p>
