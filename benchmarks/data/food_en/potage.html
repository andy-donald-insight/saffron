<p>Potage has its origins in the medieval cuisine of <a href="/Regional_variations_in_medieval_cuisine#Northern_France" title="Regional variations in medieval cuisine">northern France</a> and increased in popularity from the <a href="/High_Middle_Ages" title="High Middle Ages">High Middle Ages</a> onward. A course in a medieval feast often began with one or two potages, which would be followed by roasted meats.</p>
<p>European cottage gardens often contained a variety of crops grown together. These were called <i>potage gardens</i> by the French, as the harvest from that garden was used to make potage.&#60;ref&#62;From puritanical to pleasurable: Potage not as challenging or exotic as it sounds.
