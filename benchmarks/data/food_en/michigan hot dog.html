<p>A <b>Michigan hot dog</b>, or &#34;<b>Michigan</b>&#34;, is a steamed hot dog on a steamed bun topped with a meaty sauce, generally referred to as &#34;Michigan sauce&#34;. The sauce may be tomato-based, depending on where the Michigan is purchased.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} Michigans can be served with chopped <a href="/Onion" title="Onion">onions</a>. If served with onions, the onions can either be buried under the sauce, under the hot dog itself, or sprinkled on top of the sauce.</p>

The sauce was originally created to be used as a topping on Coney Island hot dogs. In 1914, Mr. Todoroff founded the Jackson Coney Island restaurant and created his Coney Island chili sauce recipe.

<p>How and when Michigan sauce arrived in upstate New York is somewhat of a mystery. The earliest known advertisement for Michigans appeared in the Friday, May 27, 1927, <i>Plattsburgh Daily Republican</i>.&#60;ref name=&#34;nysl.nysed&#34; /&#62; The ad announced the opening of &#34;the Michigan Hot-Dog Stand Tuesday May 24, located between the two dance halls&#34;. That hot dog stand may be the same one mentioned in the Plattsburgh Sentinel on Sept. 16, 1927, as being owned by a Mr. Garth C. Otis:</p>
<p>&#34;Garth C. Otis has leased the quarters in the Plattsburgh Theatre building formerly occupied as the Locomobile salesroom in which place he will conduct an eating place under the name of the Michigan Hot Dog and Sandwich Shop opening Saturday. Mexican chili con carne will be one of the specialties. Mr. Otis promises a first class place for those who desire short order lunches.&#34;</p>
<p>The origin of the &#34;Michigan&#34; name may have come from Plattsburgh residents Jack Rabin and his wife, who fell in love with the Jackson Coney Island hot dog while vacationing in Coney Island and subsequently recreated the sauce at Nitzi&#39;s, their Michigan hot dog stand on Route 9 just outside of Plattsburgh. However, a 1984 Sentinel article indicates that Nitzi&#39;s was established in 1935, and says Jack Rabin indicated &#34;his sauce came from Mrs. Eula Otis, who first coined the name &#39;Michigans&#39; for her hot dog and sauce.&#34; Otis was originally from Nashville and met her husband in Detroit, Michigan, where she learned to make meat sauce. They moved to Plattsburgh in the 1920s.</p>
<p>The Nitzi/Otis recipe is currently in use at Michigans Plus, located in the former <a href="/IHOP" title="IHOP">IHOP</a> building on Route 3.</p>
<p>In Vermont, the Michigan dog is almost always split and cooked on a grill before the meat sauce onions and mustard are added. Often, the bun (or a slice of bread) is also grilled. The first ones sold around the Burlington area were called Charlie&#39;s Red Hots and the small shop was started during World War II by a well-known and respected restaurateur. The family closely guarded the sauce recipe. The originals are no longer sold, but there are many Michigan copies around and many local families claim to have the &#34;Charlie&#39;s&#34; sauce recipe.</p>
