<p>The invention of baking powder and other chemical <a href="/Leavening_agent" title="Leavening agent">leavening agents</a> during the 19th century substantially increased the flexibility of this traditional pound cake by introducing the possibility of creating lighter, fluffier cakes using these traditional combinations of ingredients, and it is this transformation that brought about the modern butter cake.&#60;ref name=bakencraft&#62;{{cite web|accessdate=4 February 2015|title=The History of Cake|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.bakencraft.com/2014/09/25/history-cake-differences-betweent-cake-gateau-torte/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bakencraft.com/2014/09/25/history-cake-differences-betweent-cake-gateau-torte/</a>}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>

<p>Butter cakes are traditionally made using a <a href="/Creaming_(food)" title="Creaming (food)">creaming</a> method, in which the <a href="/Butter" title="Butter">butter</a> and <a href="/Sugar" title="Sugar">sugar</a> are first beaten until fluffy to incorporate air into the butter. <a href="/Egg_(food)" title="Egg (food)">Eggs</a> are then added gradually, creating an emulsion, followed by alternating portions of wet and dry ingredients. Butter cakes are typically rich and moist when stored at room temperature, but they tend to stiffen, dry out, and lose flavor when refrigerated, making them unsuitable for filling or frosting in advance with ingredients that must be refrigerated, such as <a href="/Cream_cheese" title="Cream cheese">cream cheese</a> <a href="/Icing_(food)" title="Icing (food)">frosting</a> and <a href="/Pastry_cream" title="Pastry cream">pastry cream</a>.</p>
