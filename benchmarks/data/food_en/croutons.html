<p>A <b>crouton</b> is a piece of sautéed or rebaked <a href="/Bread" title="Bread">bread</a>, often cubed and seasoned, that is used to add texture and flavor to <a href="/Salad" title="Salad">salads</a>,&#60;ref name=&#34;FIM&#34;/&#62; notably the <a href="/Caesar_salad" title="Caesar salad">Caesar salad</a>,&#60;ref name=&#34;Davidson&#34;/&#62; as an accompaniment to <a href="/Soup" title="Soup">soups</a>,&#60;ref name=&#34;FIM&#34;/&#62; or eaten as a <a href="/Snack_food" title="Snack food">snack food</a>. The word crouton is derived from the French <i>croûton</i>,&#60;ref name=&#34;Davidson&#34;/&#62; itself derived from <i>croûte</i>, meaning &#34;crust&#34;.  Most people consider <i>croutons</i> to come invariably in the shape of small cubes, but they can actually be of any size and shape, up to a very large slice. A croûton (crouton) is a diminutive form of a croûte (croute), much like a cigarette is a diminutive form of a cigar. Many people now use crouton for croute, so the usage has changed. Historically, however, a croute was a slice of a baguette lightly brushed with oil or <a href="/Clarified_butter" title="Clarified butter">clarified butter</a> and baked. In French cooking &#39;croûte&#39; is not only a noun but also has a verb form which describes the cooking process that transforms the bread into the crust.</p>

<p>&#34;Crouton. Derived from the French crouton, has been an English word since early in the 19th century, whereas two other connected French culinary terms, croute and croustade, have remained French...All these terms derive from the Latin word crusta, meaning &#39;shell&#39;. Thus the outside of a loaf of bread is the crust or croute. Crouton, the diminutive form, usually refers to the familiar little cubes of toasted or fried bread which might originally have been cut from a crust...It first appears in French in the 17th century when it is described as &#39;a little piece of bread crust served with drinks&#39;. In recent times, croutons are often added to fish soups, and occasionally to certain salads.&#34;{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}</p>
<p>The preparation of croutons is relatively simple. Typically the cubes of bread&#60;ref name=&#34;Davidson&#34;/&#62; are coated in oil or butter (which may be seasoned or flavored for variety) and then baked. Some commercial preparations use machinery to sprinkle various seasonings on them.&#60;ref name=&#34;FIM&#34;/&#62; Alternatively, they may be fried lightly in <a href="/Butter" title="Butter">butter</a> or <a href="/Vegetable_oil" title="Vegetable oil">vegetable oil</a>, until crisp and brown to give them a buttery flavor and crunchy texture. Some croutons are prepared with the addition of cheese.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite book | url=<a class="external free" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=ag_evsM0Ud4C&#38;pg=PA41" rel="nofollow">http://books.google.com/books?id=ag_evsM0Ud4C&#38;pg=PA41</a> | title=The Farmer&#39;s Wife Comfort Food Cookbook | publisher=MBI Publishing Company | author=Nargi, Lela | year=2008 | pages=41 | isbn=1610600525}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>Nearly any type of unsweetened bread, in a loaf&#60;ref name=&#34;FIM&#34;/&#62; or pre-sliced, with or without crust, may be used to make croutons.  Dry or stale bread&#60;ref name=&#34;FIM&#34;/&#62; or leftover bread is usually used instead of fresh bread. Once prepared, the croutons will remain fresh far longer than unprepared bread.</p>

<p>Thrifty cooks have been finding creative ways for using up stale bread since bread was invented. The connection between stale bread and soup dates to the Medieval times, when soup was served in sops (pieces of stale bread). French onion soup is classically topped with a crust of stale bread</p>
<p>Croutons, purposely spiced and gently toasted, are more refined twist on this culinary theme. One might reasonably argue croutons were inspired by <a href="/Biscotti" title="Biscotti">biscotti</a> and other ancient twice baked goods.</p>
