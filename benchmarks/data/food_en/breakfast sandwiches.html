In <a href="/North_America" title="North America">North America</a>, a <b>breakfast sandwich</b> is any <a href="/Sandwich" title="Sandwich">sandwich</a> filled with foods associated with the <a href="/Breakfast" title="Breakfast">breakfast</a> meal.

<p>Although the ingredients for the breakfast sandwich have been common elements of breakfast meals in the English-speaking world for centuries, it was not until the 19th century in the United States that people began regularly eating eggs, cheese, and meat in a sandwich.&#60;ref name=anderson&#62;{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=Heather Arndt|title=Breakfast: A History|date=2013|publisher=AltaMira Press|location=Lanham, Maryland|page=45|url=<a class="external free" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=5LghYCqDJw8C&#38;lpg=PA45&#38;dq=%22breakfast%20sandwich%22&#38;pg=PA45#v=onepage&#38;q=%22breakfast%20sandwich%22&#38;f=false" rel="nofollow">http://books.google.com/books?id=5LghYCqDJw8C&#38;lpg=PA45&#38;dq=%22breakfast%20sandwich%22&#38;pg=PA45#v=onepage&#38;q=%22breakfast%20sandwich%22&#38;f=false</a>}}&#60;/ref&#62; What would later be known as &#34;breakfast sandwiches&#34; became increasingly popular after the Civil War, and were a favorite food of pioneers during American westward expansion.

There are several types of bread used to make breakfast sandwiches:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/Hard_roll" title="Hard roll">Hard roll</a>: The traditional breakfast sandwich of the northeast&#39;s tri-state region of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut. It is believed to be one of the earliest forms of the breakfast sandwich in the United States. It consists of a hard roll, eggs, cheese and sausage, bacon or ham. In <a href="/New_Jersey" title="New Jersey">New Jersey</a>, a common breakfast sandwich is the Jersey Breakfast which consists of <a href="/Pork_roll" title="Pork roll">pork roll</a>, egg, and cheese on a hard (Kaiser) roll.&#60;ref name=&#34;Breakfast of Champions: Why New Jersey is Crazy for Pork Roll&#34;&#62;{{cite web|last1=Lazor|first1=Drew|title=Breakfast of Champions: Why New Jersey is Crazy for Pork Roll|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.seriouseats.com/2014/10/pork-roll-taylor-ham-breakfast-meat-new-jersey.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.seriouseats.com/2014/10/pork-roll-taylor-ham-breakfast-meat-new-jersey.html</a>|website=Serious Eats|accessdate=August 5, 2015}}&#60;/ref&#62;</li>
<li><a href="/Biscuit_(bread)" title="Biscuit (bread)">Biscuit</a>: Consists of a large, or cat-head biscuit, sliced, on which meat, cheese, or eggs are served.  Popular biscuits include: Sausage biscuit,&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|last1=Mauro|first1=Jeff|title=Sausage and Gravy Biscuit Sandwiches|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/jeff-mauro/sausage-and-gravy-biscuit-sandwiches-recipe.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/jeff-mauro/sausage-and-gravy-biscuit-sandwiches-recipe.html</a>|website=Food Network|accessdate=August 5, 2015}}&#60;/ref&#62; <a href="/Bacon" title="Bacon">bacon</a>, <a href="/Tomato" title="Tomato">tomato</a>, and <a href="/Country_ham" title="Country ham">country ham</a>. Fast food restaurants have put smaller versions of fried <a href="/Fillet_(cut)#Chicken" title="Fillet (cut)">chicken fillets</a> on biscuits to create chicken biscuits.  <a href="/Scrambled_eggs" title="Scrambled eggs">Scrambled eggs</a> and/or <a href="/American_cheese" title="American cheese">American cheese</a> are often added.</li>
<li><a href="/Bagel" title="Bagel">Bagel</a> sandwiches: Due to their <a href="/Jewish" title="Jewish">Jewish</a> connection, bagels generally do not contain <a href="/Pork" title="Pork">pork</a>, but other foods associated with the community, such as deli meats, <a href="/Lox" title="Lox">lox</a> or other <a href="/Smoked_fish" title="Smoked fish">smoked fish</a>, and <a href="/Cream_cheese" title="Cream cheese">cream cheese</a>.</li>
<li><a href="/English_muffin" title="English muffin">English muffin</a>: Generally contains egg and cheese with either breakfast sausage or ham. Often served in U.S. fast food outlets such as McDonald&#39;s and Starbucks.</li>
<li><a href="/Toast" title="Toast">Toast</a>: Toasted bread is one of the oldest forms of breakfast sandwich in America, and the closest to the original <a href="/Sandwich" title="Sandwich">sandwich</a> in form. While any number of items might be served on toast, eggs and bacon are the ones most associated with breakfast.</li>
<li>Specialty breads: Mostly served by restaurant chains, there are other breakfast sandwiches that do not use one of the common breakfast breads used in the United States. <a href="/Burger_King" title="Burger King">Burger King</a> uses a <a href="/Croissant" title="Croissant">croissant</a> to make a breakfast sandwich called the <a href="/Croissan&#39;Wich" title="Croissan&#39;Wich">Croissan&#39;Wich</a>, or croissant sandwich, depending on the market. McDonald&#39;s offers its traditional biscuit fillings on a sandwich made from maple flavored pancakes called a <a href="/McGriddles" title="McGriddles">McGriddles</a>. <a href="/Dunkin&#39;_Donuts" title="Dunkin&#39; Donuts">Dunkin&#39; Donuts</a> has a <a href="/Waffle" title="Waffle">waffle</a> sandwich that is similar to the McGriddles. These can be found at American fast food <a href="/Chain_store" title="Chain store">franchises</a> worldwide.</li>
