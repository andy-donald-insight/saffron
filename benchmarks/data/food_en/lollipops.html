Lollipops are available in a number of colors and flavors, particularly fruit flavors. With numerous companies producing lollipops, the candy now comes in dozens of flavors and many different shapes. They range from small ones which can be bought by the hundred and are often given away for free at <a href="/Bank" title="Bank">banks</a>, <a href="/Barber" title="Barber">barbershops</a>, and other locations, to very large ones made out of <a href="/Candy_cane" title="Candy cane">candy canes</a> twisted into a circle.</p>
<p>Most lollipops are eaten at room temperature, but &#34;<a href="/Ice_pop" title="Ice pop">ice lollipops</a>&#34; or &#34;ice lollies&#34; are frozen water-based lollipops. Similar confections on a stick made of <a href="/Ice_cream" title="Ice cream">ice cream</a>, often with a flavored coating, are usually not called by this name.</p>
<p>Some lollipops contain fillings, such as <a href="/Bubble_gum" title="Bubble gum">bubble gum</a> or soft candy. Some novelty lollipops have more unusual items, such as <a href="/Mealworm" title="Mealworm">mealworm</a> <a href="/Larva" title="Larva">larvae</a>, embedded in the candy.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web

Other novelty lollipops have non-edible centers, such a flashing light, embedded within the candy; there is also a trend{{Where|date=July 2011}} of lollipops with sticks attached to a motorized device that makes the entire lollipop spin around in one&#39;s mouth.</p>

<p>The idea of an edible candy on a stick is very simple, and it is probable that the lollipop has been invented and reinvented numerous times.&#60;ref name=lolly&#62;{{cite web|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.candyfavorites.com/shop/catalog-lollipop-history.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.candyfavorites.com/shop/catalog-lollipop-history.php</a> |title=The History of Lollipop candy |publisher=CandyFavorites.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-27}}&#60;/ref&#62; The history of the first lollipops in America appears to have been distorted over time. There is some speculation that lollipops were invented during the American Civil War (1861–1865). Others believe some version of the lollipop has been around since the early 1800s. George Smith claimed to be the first to invent the modern style lollipop in 1908 and trademarked the lollipop name in 1931.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.candycrate.com/lollipops.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.candycrate.com/lollipops.html</a> |title=Lollipops and Candy Suckers – Retro Candy from |publisher=CandyCrate.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-27}}&#60;/ref&#62; He used the idea of putting candy on a stick to make it easier to eat and reportedly named the treats after a popular racing horse, Lolly Pop.  It initially referred to soft, rather than hard candy. The term may have derived from the term &#34;lolly&#34; (tongue) and &#34;pop&#34; (slap). The first references to the lollipop in its modern context date to the 1920s.&#60;ref&#62;{{OEtymD|lollipop|accessdate=17 January 2012}}&#60;/ref&#62; Alternatively, it may be a word of Romany origin being related to the Roma tradition of selling <a href="/Candy_apple" title="Candy apple">toffee apples</a> sold on a stick. <i>Red apple</i> in the <a href="/Romany_language" title="Romany language">Romany language</a> is <i>loli phaba</i>.&#60;ref name=googlebooks&#62;{{cite book|url=<a class="external free" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=UePBhYdCgRoC&#38;pg=PA76&#38;lpg=PA76&#38;dq=lollipop+%22red+apple%22+%2Bromany&#38;source=web&#38;ots=15WL38f4Gf&#38;sig=-qj3qKMPcpUilGLsNqFFNSoWGN8&#38;hl=en&#38;sa=X&#38;oi=book_result&#38;resnum=5&#38;ct=result" rel="nofollow">http://books.google.com/books?id=UePBhYdCgRoC&#38;pg=PA76&#38;lpg=PA76&#38;dq=lollipop+%22red+apple%22+%2Bromany&#38;source=web&#38;ots=15WL38f4Gf&#38;sig=-qj3qKMPcpUilGLsNqFFNSoWGN8&#38;hl=en&#38;sa=X&#38;oi=book_result&#38;resnum=5&#38;ct=result</a> |title=What is the Romani Language? |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-27}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
