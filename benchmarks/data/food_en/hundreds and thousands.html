<p>In 1844, Eleanor Parkinson, of a well-known <a href="/Philadelphia" title="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> family of professional <a href="/Confectionery" title="Confectionery">confectioners</a>, first published her book <i>The Complete Confectioner</i>,&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web | last=Parkinson | first=Eleanor | title=The Complete Confectioner | publisher=<a class="external text" href="http://digital.lib.msu.edu/projects/cookbooks/index.html" rel="nofollow">Feeding America: The Historic American Cookbook Project</a> |url=<a class="external free" href="http://digital.lib.msu.edu/projects/cookbooks/html/books/book_23a.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://digital.lib.msu.edu/projects/cookbooks/html/books/book_23a.cfm</a> | accessdate=2009-11-19}}&#60;/ref&#62; in which she described how to make nonpareils following her comfit-making procedure, which involved multiple hot pots and hot <a href="/Syrup" title="Syrup">syrup</a>.</p>
<p>In the United States, traditional nonpareils gave way for most purposes by the mid 20th century to &#34;<a href="/Sprinkles" title="Sprinkles">sprinkles</a>&#34; (known in some parts as &#34;<a href="/Sprinkles#Jimmies" title="Sprinkles">jimmies</a>&#34;), confections nearly as small but usually oblong rather than round and soft rather than brittle. Like nonpareils, their function is more decorative than <a href="/Gustatory" title="Gustatory">gustatory</a> as their actual taste is indistinct, and the products they are applied to are usually themselves very high in sugar. Candy-covered anise seeds called <a href="/Muisjes" title="Muisjes">muisjes</a>, sometimes mistaken for traditional nonpareils, are sometimes offered at breakfast in the Netherlands to be served on bread and butter. They are, however, usually served on <a href="/Rusk#Netherlands" title="Rusk">rusk</a> to celebrate the birth of a child. This is known as &#34;<a href="/Muisjes#Beschuit_met_muisjes" title="Muisjes">beschuit met muisjes</a>&#34;.</p>
<p>In the UK, <a href="/Australasia" title="Australasia">Australia and New Zealand</a>, nonpareils are known as &#34;hundreds-and-thousands&#34;. In Australia and New Zealand, they are often eaten on top of <a href="/Cupcake" title="Cupcake">patty cakes</a> or on buttered bread as <a href="/Fairy_bread" title="Fairy bread">fairy bread</a>, as festive items at children&#39;s <a href="/Birthday" title="Birthday">birthday parties</a>.</p>

<p>The term &#34;nonpareils&#34; can also refer to a specific confection: a round flat chocolate drop with the upper surface coated with nonpareils.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external free" href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/nonpareil&#60;/ref&#38;gt" rel="nofollow">http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/nonpareil&#60;/ref&#38;gt</a>;  This confection is also referred to as &#34;chocolate nonpareils&#34;.  <a href="/Nestl%C3%A9" title="Nestlé">Nestlé</a> makes a variety marketed as <a href="/Sno-Caps" title="Sno-Caps">Sno-Caps</a>.  In <a href="/Australia" title="Australia">Australia</a>, these confections are commonly known as &#34;chocolate freckles&#34;, or simply &#34;freckles&#34;.
