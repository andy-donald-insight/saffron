<p>One of the first recipes printed in English for Manchet Breads comes from 1588 and the recipe book <i>The Good Huswifes Handmaide</i> by an unknown author. In it the author explains that the flour must be fine and have been <a href="/Sieve" title="Sieve">boulted</a> twice.</p>
<p>There are several recipes for Manchets mentioned in <a href="/Florence_White" title="Florence White">Florence White</a>&#39;s classic English Cuisine book <i>Good Things in England</i> first published in 1932. She gives five regional varieties of the bread and quotes from sources for the recipes. The first is from <a href="/Gervase_Markham" title="Gervase Markham">Gervase Markham</a> in <a href="/Nottinghamshire" title="Nottinghamshire">Nottinghamshire</a> published in 1615 where White quotes an anonymous source that describes a Manchet as &#39;Your best and principal bread is a manchet&#39;.&#60;ref&#62;Florence White: Good Things in England published by English Folk Cookery Association 1932 Jonathan Cape 1968 page 71&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>There is also a reference to &#34;Manchetts for the Queen&#39;s Maides&#34;, a royal ordinance originating from Eltham Palace in 1526 during Henry VIII&#39;s reign which describes a menu for medieval aristocracy that includes mention of manchettes.&#60;ref&#62;Harleian manuscript No 642 British Museum&#60;/ref&#62; It is inserted because a correspondent has requested when manchets were to be served at court. This suggests that in origin it was a luxurious bread containing ingredients that were only available to the wealthy. The most superior wheat for a manchet was said to come from Heston, near Hounslow during the reign of Elizabeth I.&#60;ref&#62;Katharine E.

<p>Florence White makes reference to three contemporary versions. The Cornish Manchant which she confirms is shaped by hand,&#60;ref&#62;Florence White: Good Things in England page 72&#60;/ref&#62; a version from the Isle of Wight and a recipe from 1676 from Sussex for <a href="/Lady_Arundel&#39;s_Manchet" title="Lady Arundel&#39;s Manchet">Lady Arundel&#39;s Manchet</a>. The latter version she updates.</p>
