<p>The name is first known in Gervaise Markham&#39;s 1623 <i>Countrey Contentments, or English Huswife</i> (new ed.) vi. 222   &#34;From this small Oat-meale, by oft steeping it in water and clensing it, and then boyling it to a thicke and stiffe jelly, is made that excellent dish of meat which is so esteemed in the West parts of this Kingdome, which they call Wash-brew, and in Chesheire and Lankasheire they call it Flamerie or Flumerie&#34;.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite book|last=Markham|first=Gervaise|title=Countrey Contentments, or English Huswife|year=1623}}&#60;/ref&#62;&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|title=History of Flummery|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.foodsofengland.co.uk/flummery.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.foodsofengland.co.uk/flummery.htm</a>|work=Foods Of England|accessdate=2 April 2013}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>The name is derived from the Welsh word for a similar dish made from sour oatmeal and husks, <i>llymru</i>, which itself is of unknown origin.
