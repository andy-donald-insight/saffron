<p><b>Gooey butter cake</b> is a type of <a href="/Cake" title="Cake">cake</a> traditionally made in the American <a href="/Midwestern_United_States" title="Midwestern United States">Midwest</a> city of <a href="/St._Louis%2C_Missouri" title="St. Louis, Missouri">St. Louis</a>. Gooey butter cake is a flat and dense cake made with wheat <a href="/Cake_flour" title="Cake flour">cake flour</a>, <a href="/Butter" title="Butter">butter</a>, <a href="/Sugar" title="Sugar">sugar</a>, and <a href="/Egg_(food)" title="Egg (food)">eggs</a>, typically near an inch tall, and dusted with <a href="/Powdered_sugar" title="Powdered sugar">powdered sugar</a>. While sweet and rich, it is somewhat firm, and is able to be cut into pieces similarly to a <a href="/Chocolate_brownie" title="Chocolate brownie">brownie</a>. Gooey butter cake is generally served as a type of <a href="/Coffee_cake" title="Coffee cake">coffee cake</a> and not as a formal dessert cake. There are two distinct variants of the gooey butter: a bakers&#39; gooey butter and a cream cheese and commercial yellow cake mix variant. It is believed to have originated in the 1930s.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://whatscookingamerica.net/History/Cakes/GooeyButterCake.htm" rel="nofollow">History of Gooey Butter Cake&#60;!-- Bot generated title --&#62;</a>&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>The St. Louis Convention &#38; Visitors Commission includes a recipe for the cake on its website, calling it &#34;one of St. Louis&#39; popular, quirky foods&#34;; the recipe calls for a bottom layer of <a href="/Butter" title="Butter">butter</a> and yellow <a href="/Batter_(cooking)" title="Batter (cooking)">cake batter</a>, and a top layer made from <a href="/Egg_(food)" title="Egg (food)">eggs</a>, <a href="/Cream_cheese" title="Cream cheese">cream cheese</a>, and, in one case, <a href="/Almond" title="Almond">almond</a> extract. The cake is dusted with <a href="/Confectioner&#39;s_sugar" title="Confectioner&#39;s sugar">confectioner&#39;s sugar</a> before being served. The cake is best eaten soon after baking it. It should be served at room temperature or warm.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|title=Ooey Gooey Butter Cake|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.thesweetart.com/2011/06/ooey-gooey-butter-cake.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.thesweetart.com/2011/06/ooey-gooey-butter-cake.html</a>|work=The Sweet Art|accessdate=3 October 2011}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Origin_and_popularity">Origin and popularity</span></h2>
<p>A legend about the cake&#39;s origin is included in <i>Saint Louis Days...Saint Louis Nights</i> (<a class="external text" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0963829815" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0963829815">ISBN 0-9638298-1-5</a>), a cookbook published in the mid-1990s by the <a href="/Junior_League" title="Junior League">Junior League</a> of St. Louis. The cake was supposedly first made by accident in the 1930s by a St. Louis-area <a href="/German_American" title="German American">German American</a> baker who was trying to make regular cake batter but reversed the proportions of butter&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external free" href="http://whatscookingamerica.net/History/Cakes/GooeyButterCake.htm&#60;/ref&#38;gt" rel="nofollow">http://whatscookingamerica.net/History/Cakes/GooeyButterCake.htm&#60;/ref&#38;gt</a>; and flour.</p>
<p>John Hoffman was the owner of the bakery where the mistake was made. The real story is there were two types of butter &#34;smears&#34; used in his bakery: a gooey butter and a deep butter. The deep butter was used for deep butter coffee cakes. The gooey butter was used as an adhesive for things like <a href="/Danish_(pastry)" title="Danish (pastry)">Danish rolls</a> and <a href="/Stollen" title="Stollen">stollens</a>. The gooey butter was smeared across the surface, then the item was placed in <a href="/Coconut" title="Coconut">coconut</a>, <a href="/Hazelnuts" title="Hazelnuts">hazelnuts</a>, <a href="/Peanut" title="Peanut">peanuts</a>, crumbs or whatever was desired so they would stick to the product.</p>
<p>Hoffman hired a new baker that was supposed to make deep butter cakes, but got the two butter smears mixed up. The mistake wasn&#39;t caught until after the cakes came out of the <a href="/Proofing_(baking_technique)" title="Proofing (baking technique)">proof box</a>. Rather than throw them away, Hoffman went ahead and baked them up. As this was around the <a href="/Great_Depression" title="Great Depression">Great Depression</a> that was another reason to be <a href="/Frugality" title="Frugality">thrifty</a>. The new type of cake sold so well, Hoffman kept producing them and soon, so did the other bakers around St. Louis.</p>
<p>Another St. Louis baker, Fred Heimburger, also remembers the cake coming on the scene in the 1930s, as a slip up that became a popular hit and local <a href="/Acquired_taste" title="Acquired taste">acquired taste</a>. He liked it well enough that Mr. Heimburger tried to promote Gooey butter cake by taking samples of it with him when he traveled out of St. Louis to visit other bakers in their shops. They liked it all right, but they couldn&#39;t get their customers to buy it, with reactions tending to regard it as looking too much like a mistake, and &#34;a flat gooey mess&#34;.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web | url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/19/garden/a-butter-cake-that-sticks-to-the-gums.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/19/garden/a-butter-cake-that-sticks-to-the-gums.html</a> | title=A Butter Cake That Sticks to the Gums | publisher=<i><a href="/The_New_York_Times" title="The New York Times">The New York Times</a></i> | date=April 19, 1989 | accessdate=4 January 2014 | author=Barry, Ann}}&#60;/ref&#62; And so it remained as a regional favorite for many decades.</p>

<p>Modern versions of this confection, originally sold as a breakfast pastry or &#34;coffee cake&#34;, have shown up on upscale restaurant menus across the Midwest and even the West coast. The first such interpretation is believed to have happened in 1991 at a small fine dining restaurant located in Springfield, Missouri. The restaurant, called Clary&#39;s after the surname of the two brothers who originally opened it, offered their customers a blueberry version of the gooey butter cake with vanilla bean ice cream and blueberry sauce. The dessert was originally called Gary&#39;s Favorite after Gary Tombridge, a friend of co-owner James Clary, served the chef a raspberry flavored gooey butter cake after dinner at Tombridge&#39;s home. The chef remarked what a wonderful pastry it was and wondered why no one had ever served it as a dessert. The dessert, along with Clary&#39;s signature souffles, became a staple at the eatery. Clary left the restaurant business in 2008 but says he still serves the gooey butter cake to friends and catering clients. 
The sweet dessert can now be found on many restaurant menus including the popular Kansas City chain Ya Ya&#39;s, Murray&#39;s in Columbia, Missouri, and even as far as Seattle, where The Five Spot serves a pumpkin version of the classic pastry.</p>
